<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, airing the day after the 2008 presidential election, began with Opie and Jimmy Norton in studio, celebrating Barack Obama's victory and contrasting their enthusiasm with their usual antagonism towards the absent Anthony Cumia, who was at his parents' 25th-anniversary party.  The show initially focused on a jokingly titled "Guns for Queers" theme, aligning their support for Obama with their advocacy for gay marriage and women over 25.  This segued into a discussion of controversial NFL games, specifically a Steelers/Chargers match, focusing on a disputed referee call and a remarkable catch. A brief technical issue with a microphone was noted.  Callers provided further commentary on the game's controversial ending.

Opie relayed a phone call from Anthony explaining his absence. The hosts then discussed Anthony's family's extensive celebratory traditions. Another caller, Carlton, offered humorous observations on the election and the Steelers game. Opie shared an awkward experience at a gym pool.  Rich Vos called in, detailing his successful stand-up shows in Boston and promoting his new book, "I Hate Your Guts," which criticizes Al Roker and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The conversation shifted to the UFC fight between Brock Lesnar and Randy Couture, analyzing Lesnar's victory and speculating about the possibility of the fight being fixed; a caller from Toronto even suggested Couture threw the fight.

Patrice O'Neal joined the show, filling in for Anthony. The discussion continued on the UFC fight, examining the fighters' personalities and skills. The conversation then pivoted to the political implications of Obama's election, focusing on reactions within both black and white communities. O'Neal offered his perspective on the varied interpretations of the election results within each racial group.  The conversation touched upon the bestseller list and the surprising presence of Jimmy Norton's book alongside other titles.

A lengthy in-studio discussion followed, focusing on race and social issues in America, particularly the experiences of Black Americans. O'Neal engaged in a heated debate with a caller and Norton, tackling historical and contemporary racism, the perceived disconnect between successful Black individuals and the broader Black community, and the complexities of defining "blackness," especially in relation to Obama.  This exchange involved strong language and personal anecdotes.  The conversation escalated to a charged and emotional debate, punctuated by frequent interruptions and heated exchanges.

The discussion then transitioned to ranking the top three stand-up comedians, with Carlin, Pryor, and Cosby frequently mentioned.  Other comedians like Chris Rock, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, and Lenny Bruce were also debated. The conversation veered into various tangents, including anecdotes, the use of plethysmographs in pedophile cases, and a Texas pastor's "seven days of sex" sermon.  The conversation returned to Black perspectives on gay marriage, with O'Neal voicing his views.  The show concluded with promotional announcements for upcoming appearances by the hosts.

A significant portion of the show involved a detailed comparison of the gay rights movement and the Civil Rights movement. O'Neal argued for their fundamental differences, highlighting the difficulty of fostering empathy between these distinct experiences.  The conversation included discussions of the motivations behind the gay rights movement, abortion, and the role of religion in shaping public opinion.  The discussion was marked by frequent use of offensive language and provocative commentary from O'Neal.  The show also touched upon a Texas pastor's challenge for daily sex and the celibacy of priests and their repressed sexual urges.  The show ended with personal anecdotes from the hosts and guests, including O'Neal's upcoming wedding and his views on sexual experiences, along with listener calls on the gay rights debate and other topics.

Finally, a brief announcement promoted a December 1st show featuring both Patrice O'Neal and Anthony Cumia together in studio for the first time, noting the absence of Ron Bennington and Nunu.

[00:02:30]  25 women over 25 i hear them i think that's a good age to start under 25 under 25 is a bit creepy yeah  creepy i got a call from anthony around uh seven o'clock i'm watching all those fine football games  and man what a what a week for football uh your cowboys did beat the redskins yesterday by the way  i lost i was 14 it was 10-7 uh washington i think and i and i uh just forgot to keep watching 
[00:03:00]  really it's amazing to me how little i care about sports anymore i don't know what happened that  cheater thing that i've complained about uh changed my view on sports even football yeah in a way because  it's like yeah i want to see them do well but it took away my passion yeah being so aggravated at a  sports figure or having such an annoying encounter so and i love you know i love the cowboys since i  was i was no 1978 sure but uh i still want them but it took away my passion for watching sports at  all oh that sucks i mean i'm still uh deep into football deep into hockey well your cowboys won 
[00:03:30]  but someone is saying that the the end of the steelers game was crazy what happened does anyone know  i'm getting some uh communiques here jeff m from satin allen writes uh you have to mention the wild  end to the steelers game yesterday the referees blew the call i didn't see this game or the  highlights a hook and ladder with an illegal forward pass that took a touchdown away from the steelers  which would have covered the point spread oh one of those games oh boy what happened travis  oh why would that mic work are you kidding hold on get the right one hit hey tim it's program you 
[00:04:00]  gotta push that in like that i could do i could do everyone's job around here go uh yeah it was big  do i guess people who tim has one job hold on tim has one job to push program down his two jobs  one is to have a retarded haircut which he does well what are you doing we're all in program i checked  them all no i no jimmy saw me push program he did but but but but then what i what then but uh what 
[00:04:30]  see we need to bring steve back already steve freed yeah steve free forever whole place is falling  apart yeah all right we're all right now go ahead travis uh it was 11 to 10 yeah steal uh the  chargers had the ball final play who was winning travis the steelers were winning um so you know  for the final play the chargers you know threw some backwards laterals you know sure uh fumbled the ball  and uh palomalu on the steelers that big hawaiian guy yeah sure uh he grabbed the ball and jumped in  the end zone so right then and there it was 17 to 10 steelers but then the refs went back and they 
[00:05:00]  reversed the call because there was a forward lateral which meant that the play was dead right  then and there so there was never a fumble so i guess for the people who were betting on the game  that's a big deal yeah most of us don't give a crap about winner you know winning or losing and then  we want to cover some bets out there right peeps and then the weirder people were very happy that it  was 11 to 10 because that was the first 11 to 10 nfl game ever shut up i swear to god there hasn't 
[00:05:30]  been 11 to 10 game never been in 11 to 10 game really no one's ever kicked a field goal and  gotten four safeties that seems very common hey do they call the uh the because i was at the gym and  i couldn't hear but that's the scoop play in the steelers game was that a catch they showed it i was  in the gym too when that happened did really yeah that deck out the dreadlocks or whatever it's one  of the best catches i've ever seen i don't think uh i think they said another record the the most 
[00:06:00]  replays for one play ever because they showed that play over and over and over again did they  call it a catch or not you know i missed that i i i only saw half the game all right because he  scooped like his hand went under the ball just as it was looks like he was hitting the turf  and they they played that uh play over and over again so i don't know you don't know all right  all right it was a catch they should have given it yeah so i'm watching football and then uh the  phone rings at 7 15 and it's anthony i'm like wow for the first time in four years anthony's  calling me to say hi yeah happy sunday do some show prep yeah i think he wants to talk about 
[00:06:30]  football and you know maybe do a little show prep for the show on monday no i'm not delusional i'm  like oh boy how long into the conversation and i know it like did he did he say like did it start  off casual like hey how are you uh yeah i uh and then sag into it or it wasn't even a how are you  it's like lots of noise lots of ah in the background and you know uh i don't know i don't

[00:08:00]  be open on a sunday oh really but we were unsuccessful but that's understandable because what you had  a white and a red and you know you didn't expect people to have more than a glass right well i think  we had about 12 bottles yeah exactly and we weren't expecting to run out 12 bottles of each  it was close what time did you leave ah i think i closed i think i actually like locked the door  for him wow really well i'm exaggerating but uh i was a kind of late but not not terribly maybe 
[00:08:30]  nine o'clock or so oh that's not bad so what the party ended at nine that's probably when the last  person kind of left that's when it was kind of wrapping up all right we buzzed you seem pretty  chipper me i'm fine yeah you seem like i'm a champion yeah yeah once in a while you can  danny looks but danny holds it pretty well occasionally you'll you'll you'll see him  like you look for him he's just gone for 10 minutes and you know he's on the ball right  and there's a problem right when he kind of duck walks in and he's been out of the studio and it's 
[00:09:00]  like 10 after an hour there's an issue this isn't happening his body is finally rebelling  do you get the the beer dumps oh yeah of course yeah absolutely yeah i'm i'm kind of bummed because  today was supposed to be raisin bran uh monday i did have uh the reminder set in the phone yeah my  phone i just didn't mention it since that wasn't here yeah but we were going to do raisin bran monday  i had forgotten and steve came in and reminded me this morning do you mind if we put off raisin  bran monday well fans don't rebel what i know we're we're adults i think i completely forgot that

[00:13:00]  you destroying that ass that fat load that that hypocrite yeah i mean you like dissected the whole  limus thing and how al roker got involved and then in the end how al roker gets slapped in the face  basically for doing you know i mean well actually uh what was i going to try to say like al roker  has some controversy yeah that should have got him fired following the logic that he put forth  a month later after you know everybody remembers after he did what he did so i just i just address 
[00:13:30]  his blog you know what i was trying to do there i i realized i was going to give away your chapter so  i was like oh no because you want people to read it but basically you destroy al roker yeah and show  him as the hypocrite he really is yeah i just i i'll tell you what i do in the chapter it's fine i  rip apart his blog that he blogged about imus and then he maybe wasn't supposed to come on our show  here he was supposed to come on it didn't come on right he kind of canceled about that yeah he had a  book or something he was pushing right and then uh and we were going to call him out or talk to him  about it and he just canceled the appearance and right right and then i also did the um rock and roll 
[00:14:00]  hall of fame chapter part one oh yeah part one i smashed them a little bit which was very very good  to the book i hate your guts uh in bookstores now yeah and you made the the bestseller list i did  make your bestseller list yeah i don't know how long but i i am on this week so i'm right it'll  come out november 23rd i think is when the list is actually in the times now on saturday i went and  saw the islanders they finally won a game but that's not the point here uh because i was at the hockey  game and then i went to fh riley's and my brother's too cheap to get the pay-per-view for the ufc 
[00:14:30]  fight i'm sitting there going just in there going who won who won no one knew and then yesterday  i'm checking all these uh you know sports websites you know espn a little site like that  and and they don't write about the the ufc for some reason not yet they don't know it's what's  that about does anyone else know notice this i think that i don't know if they're afraid that  it's not a popular enough sport which if they're afraid of that they're out of touch  they're completely out of touch if they don't know how big uh this this couture or lesnar fight was 
[00:15:00]  right i just assumed every sports uh website would have who won the fight that's all i wanted  to know and then finally it took a while but uh you know lesnar beat uh randy couture you have  to google it to find it which is what i had to do um if you go to some of the traditionals they  might have it i don't know where to look for it i actually didn't see the fight danny's got it up  now i did not see uh lesnar i guess just uh you know just controlled the fight dude he's massive  yeah yeah it's ridiculous uh lesnar beat him in uh the second round right yeah sunday 
[00:15:30]  morning yahoo had a huge write-up right on the front page the first thing you clicked on it was  there i finally found it but it took me a while you know the traditional websites didn't have it  and then i i did what jimmy did i actually googled it and i think i ended up on yahoo that's where i  did find it yeah they had a great write-up on it and detailed the whole fight it was uh it was there  and also the news that apparently new york is expecting to get approval good yeah finally finally  they're gonna let this happen in uh new york state finally and randy couture's we're looking 
[00:16:00]  at the video right now randy couture is like 230 i think brock lesnar is like 265 i think he is  brock lesnar's 265 just son of a bitch is huge it's it's ridiculous and now he's the champion  and a lot of people are saying what is this about that uh they you know they they kind of they're  kind of saying that in these storylines with uh ufc might be a bit on the fixed side like wrestling  i'm like come on you still gotta you still gotta fight i don't think randy couture is the type of  guy that would allow brock lesnar to you know win lesnar the size wise lesnar looks like i would 
[00:16:30]  look if i was fighting couture like as far as the size difference randy couture is a big dude we've  had him in a few times hell yeah lesnar is a frighteningly big guy he's an animal and he's in  shape and he's tattooed and he can fight lesnar's a dangerous one even when brock lesnar was in the  wwe he was just scary as all hell when you know that for the most part that stuff is fake but you  know the guys are getting beat up a bit here and there in the wrestling ring the thing that makes 
[00:17:00]  i think the difference it's not i don't think these are fixed at all i think these are real fights  the only difference is between this and boxing is how fast he got a championship that's what they're  surprised at is what i'm getting at the fourth uh the fourth fight of his professional mma career he  gets it but hey look they're a newer sport they don't have the same ranking i i guess the same uh  the same thing boxing doesn't and it's about who's gonna pay for the fights right now they're  still on that thing where they're trying to get the whole country into the sport right once the  whole country is into the sport they have a little bit more uh time hopefully before these guys get 
[00:17:30]  a shot you know not to talk demographics but the younger male demos are way into this sport so what  the hell are they waiting for maybe the older guys aren't uh you know taking a peek yet because  they're still into the boxing more than the ufc but this thing is just exploding this ufc  yeah look at that beating oh my look at the end of the second round he is yeah he's hammer fisting  him yeah once they get you on the ground he hit he hit couture with a good shot couture went down  and then uh lesnar uh who's about six foot eleven yeah just fell on him and they do this hammer fist 
[00:18:00]  thing where you're like in boxing when you fall on the ground you have to back up and the ref gets  you up this thing they just they do like it's like a schoolyard fight yeah except they're both  professional killers and that fedor is famous for this when they get you he's a big that almost  unbeatable russian they get you on the ground and they just it's awful they just beat your face into  the match it looks like randy couture never punched out he was he just waited for the ref to like finally 
[00:18:30]  stop the fight the ref stopped it i don't i don't see randy like tapping out anywhere no uh randy couture  like you said we've had him in a few times he he's the type of guy that's not tapping out ever  you have to kill him randy ready couture fought with a he beat uh who was it who broke his arm  gabriel gonzaga broke his arm and he and he finished the fight and won it couture's a savage uh let's  say hi to somebody in toronto uh i don't know your name sir but you're saying that couture threw the  fight you're thinking yeah it's jonathan up in toronto hey jonathan uh yeah i i think he did throw it  just because uh i think he wants to fight fedor plus i know he hates dana white 
[00:19:00]  and their relationship isn't that great right now yes but i think that he threw it just to get  out of his contract so that he can fight fedor wherever he wants to fight him oh you mean he had  one more fight that he owed we see that i don't think it's a one fight i didn't mean to cut you off  sorry jimmy no no can you show him the knockdown sorry go ahead but you i'm i'm being oh yeah yeah  yeah no i i think he has like a couple years on there or maybe a year less so he wants to get out of 
[00:19:30]  that so he can fight fedor wherever he wants to fight him you know i mean and before he gets too  old well he's up there already he's 45 years old yeah that's pretty old in the in the ufc game man  oh that is true but if he waits until he's 47 and he's his contract expired then he'll be two years  older right yeah but that punch it's hard to see the punch but then again it could be like that ali  sunny liston punch they said it didn't happen and if he if he was going to throw the fight why didn't  he just tap out to maybe save some of his brain cells man well no i don't think he threw the 
[00:20:00]  fight but i think that he you know didn't give his best showing just so that you know maybe dana  white thinks twice about putting him in another fight and the next time he tries to get out of  his contract he might be successful yeah but if you're writing couture there's nothing bad about  beating brock lesnar yeah then again dude here's the thing i don't know if i'll agree with you because  he's 45 years old now that the interest in him fedor is kind of weighing a little bit because it's  like ah couture was a great great fighter but you know look what this younger dude did to him now 
[00:20:30]  people want to see brock lesnar fight fedor yeah absolutely you know if anyone doesn't watch mixed  martial artists you we're talking about names you don't understand honestly look at the phones  jimmy that's all you have to do is talk ufc and they're lit people want to talk about this stuff i hope  i want this sport just to get i mean because our buddy rogan is an amazing announcer he's the he's  their main uh ring announcer yeah on the play-by-play on the side and uh these fights me  and bobby went to that one rampage jackson lost his title to a forrest griffin and it was so exciting 
[00:21:00]  to be at a live fight i mean wow i forgot how exciting this to go to a live event yeah i'd never  been to a live fight before it was amazing you know what uh dana white isn't shy we'll get him on  the phone i would love to talk to him yeah and we'll get that guy from toronto to tell dana white  the owner of the ufc you know that he thinks reny couture through the fight and listen to  what dana white will say to you if he thinks couture through the fight he'd say it yeah absolutely  just past the midway point of brown two heavyweight  which is kind of crazy because he's only fought four times but but he's a monster 
[00:21:30]  he's a big big dude and he's he's a real like wrestler yeah and he's not some freak you know 
[00:22:00]  kimbo slice he looked the guy was a great street fighter but he's not no he's not this guy brock  lesnar would kill kimbo slice yeah he's a very scary that's a very scary guy and then brock's uh  humble victory speech after the fight i can't believe it i want to thank i want to thank dana  the ufc and i want to thank this guy reny couture he's a lot of balls to take a year off and come  back and fight a young buck like me i got the utmost respect for reny couture now brock in your fourth 
[00:22:30]  fight in mma challenging and winning the heavyweight title did you ever believe that this was possible  you know i just believe in hard work and it and then that it pays off honest to god i may come  across as a cocky sob but i'm just confident that's what the lord gave me he gave me my body  and my mind god bless you god bless you there you go brock lesnar's the champ he does seem arrogant but  uh you know who does he fight next jimmy i don't know man i honestly don't know we got to get dana 
[00:23:00]  white on the phone today i would like i'm assuming that uh steve would be all over that right he is  all right yeah he is uh i would like to see obviously i want to see i mean i've been i want  fedor to fight anybody right i want him to fight lesnar and couture together i just want to see fedor  in the ufc kind of bummed i didn't see the fight now i should have like blown off hockey and just  did the right thing and find a pay-per-view sorry what'd you miss eight minutes sorry you watch  you know but eight minutes of ufc is a lot of time uh all right here we go it's uh it's opie and jimmy

[00:25:00]  how do you tie in football i know it stinks donovan mcnab apparently didn't know it was possible to tie  he didn't know that that was a reality oh that's good i didn't know either but i'm not in the nfl  yeah we were talking about this last week they should do the shootout yep like college oh yeah  do the college thing sure yeah you can't walk away from an nfl game tied ever no it's just that stinks  and the philly announcers were beside themselves last night i happen to be watching it in philly 
[00:25:30]  and they were crazy what was the final score uh 13 13 why were they crazy trashing the bengals or  they just no they were trashing their team because they had a shot to go for a fourth and one in the  final period and kicking the ball away meant surrendering to a tie no matter what yeah and  they were just going no you can't you can't and they were going crazy see i didn't watch the game  they surrendered to a tie kind of yeah fourth and one and you should have gone for it at least  of course boy fourth and one this is in the in the overtime and time was running out and they needed 
[00:26:00]  to get some yards to get down the field to have another set of downs but instead they kicked the  ball away because because the field position wise they would have been possibly giving up a field goal  and a loss but they have to do that then maybe you have to go for it no i'll actually i disagree  thank god i'm not an eagles fan whatsoever whatsoever it said 877-212-0&a patrice o'neill joins the  program next uh op and anthony actually opian little jimmy norton today 
[00:26:30]  here check it out the opian anthony show  we got uh me we got jim norton and patrice o'neill good morning gotta rename the show for today i guess  good morning o j p o j p hi i like that we should have known you were in boston yesterday me and kenny  i picked the train back yesterday afternoon i could have hitched a ride back with you i drove 
[00:27:00]  you back took a nice easy ride in my big tank going down 84 then 91 in the merit nice quiet ride  forced my girl to drive the last hour and a half that's beautiful oh yeah oh your girl was with  you that means no rest stops for patrice o'neill this time around no rest stops with hey oh oh and it  was a rest stop kind of day too i was tired and i was trying to stay up and she was you know driving  half in the other lane really oh because she drives 10 and 2 but you really can't drive a tank 10 and 2 
[00:27:30]  no you gotta you gotta kind of rock that her dainty fingers but she did a good job we we survived but  it was a nice it was a good ride i can't let anybody drive i can't let her i freak out i just i can't  sleep in there unless it's kenny who i trust but even kenny's eyesight stinks so i can't trust  anybody else driving no in in a couple of times you know you just i did knock out because i was  just exhausted and but the only time i would sleep was when she started telling me stories and that  was that was she started sharing things and she's really into music and stuff and so she's she just 
[00:28:00]  loves how much she loves it so i you know when she loves something because barely she barely loves  anything but she loves music so she's talking and i'm trying to stay up and i just knocked right out  it was like a dream and i would wake up and he was almost home and then a couple of times when she  would she just doesn't she didn't understand how to negotiate how heavy the truck is and how fast  she should be going behind somebody on the merit because the merit is not a highway it's like a 
[00:28:30]  thing is you've been on the right it's just like it's a scary road with no trucks and i like it  no it is terrifying because it's a lot of like just uh curves you do a left curve into a right curve  then a deer pops out he did the merit right the merit's horrible and then they had the gas stations  and stuff you that you have to do a an official nascar pit stop to get off these things it's the  it's it's right it's the it's the scariest road but and then all of a sudden you they give you  maybe 10 feet to get up to speed because people are flying around curves and you got to get in front 
[00:29:00]  of them oh it's when you're like leaving the gas station you ever been on the merit statistically if  you drive on the merit every day for a week you will die it's an awful road yes it is it there's  no lights on it at night it's terrible oh that's right yeah i'm curving i forgot about that because  it goes through all these rich neighborhoods they don't want the lights so it's pitch dark the the  deer on the side of the road they're they're feasting oh i drive it says it's wine every time  oh yeah are you that guy oh i'm an ass and i don't turn them off for oncoming nothing i'm just 
[00:29:30]  deal with it because i'm so afraid what i'm afraid of on the merit is smashing into a reindeer  and and and it's like hitting another car yeah like it's not like a it's not like a thing where  you hit an animal or a poor animal it it can kill you yeah your airbags will come on if you hit one  of those deer and deer are dumb because they don't have any uh natural enemies so they don't know  anything is is is unsafe right they're just stupid so that's why they get hit all the time is that 
[00:30:00]  isn't that they're not mesmerized by the lights like the lights don't know they don't know that  they're gonna die they're trying to figure out what you are they're stupid that's how dumb they  are that's the same thing those wildebeest you ever see the wildebeest get their head chewed off by  alligator and all the rest of them stand there and watch yeah because alligators not aren't even  their natural enemy they don't even know that they just go okay all right this dude got his face  chewed off yeah but as a creature that is alive somehow how do you not when when like you're 
[00:30:30]  walking your whole life you see nothing but other things with little bones on their head  and then you hear like a with with lights how do you not go let me get out of the way how do you  look at that there's just there's no natural nothing to it but it should be a natural thing at this  point how many tears have bit it what they should talk to each other i mean you know those big things  coming at you 70 miles an hour with those two lights on it stay away from there shouldn't be  other crackheads once one saw what it did to the other ones you figure how could it be brand new 
[00:31:00]  crackheads when look at what happened to this dude you gotta communicate at least the words  you gotta communicate we know crack's bad there are you crack but at least some of us don't do it  deer they don't care they just walk right out look at the cars you suck aim for them if you see them  yeah that was me driving back and talking to stump brain all night about things and half the show  hung out in boston over the weekend yeah you did what comics come home comics come home what was the  lineup good i used to love going on that thing i haven't gone in a few years they lowered the uh

[00:34:30]  oh dude did you get to see it i guess you were before no but they got a great these great sites  now that you could just see everything yeah like it's amazing and um it's almost like why would  you i hate to say it why would you yeah yeah why would you do the pay-per-view thing oh it's  fantastic especially with ufc because not everyone is talking about it so you could just like you  could avoid the results and then find it a little later on i just think people are it right now  people are just getting it's very like i said i used to love it when it was your thing versus my 
[00:35:00]  thing like i've been taking karate for 10 years right you've been taking kung fu for 15 and it's  like it's like blood sport right okay let's do what you do and versus what i do and when when the uh  the gracie started tying everybody up in knots because they because they didn't know what to do  everybody started to turn it into what it is now which is a whole art form by itself which is mma  which i'm not i don't like the fact that everybody does the same thing i like the fact that some 
[00:35:30]  karate dude will okay you can't even tell what they know it's like he knows jujitsu really they all  know the same thing wrestlers and all that stuff but brock lesnar i'm telling you i've been watching  since he's been in it the the fight he lost he was dominating that guy i mean he was dominating  frank mear right frank mear and he just knew what to do frank mear that's the thing about fighting  these guys if you're a regular dude like we always used to joke me and me and keith used to joke about  okay you think you can beat mike tyson if it was he punched your mama in the face anger you know if you 
[00:36:00]  if you was like you picked my mama and you go i'm gonna come on no because he's skilled your your  attitude can't so these dudes if you're skilled no matter how angry and how much heart you got you're  gonna lose right brock lesnar just wasn't skilled enough to fight frank murray but as a man he was  just he he was treating frank murray bad then the second fight that i saw him where he beat that guy to  texas madman or whatever he's a legitimate guy keith heron beat that guy and he did something that 
[00:36:30]  scared me that made me know he's a bad dude he punched keith heron keith heron rolled backwards  like a ball and brock lesnar was on top of him like a cat like i've never seen anything like that like  that with that hammer fist thing where they get you on the ground they just bash your bash your head  into the floor dude it was scary so when i heard that he was gonna fight uh randy couture and they come  from the same they're both all american wrestlers and dude i didn't think randy could do it just 
[00:37:00]  because he's just he's 44 i understand heart and soul but he's 44 versus a 31 year old machine see i  thought couture had a good shot just because even though he is a lot older a guy like that who has  seen so many other guy it's like you said they they always know something and sometimes i figure  he's just such a veteran what he knows is cheating like he would all what i know and what you know 
[00:37:30]  he would know how to cheat he would know how to gouge or something but just skill against skill is  nothing because he's not a submission guy uh uh couture he's a wrestler and he grounds and pounds and he  might know how to choke you out but he's not a submission dude he's not a guy that can go oh okay  your wrist is showing let me twist your hand off let me take your oh he messed up let me get his  ear right he's not one of those dudes man and lesnar dude look at him man he's a he's a any and 
[00:38:00]  it's legit and like i said you know i like i'm a wrestling fan i used to be big wrestling fan but i'm  always curious to who the toughest guy in the world is in wrestling and there's only a few guys where  other wrestlers go i'm they were comfortable saying i was afraid of him one of them is the steiner  brothers like the the scott and and rick they just people were scared of them why because they  were just giving a little extra twist and stuff were mean and they they loved pain and they just  knew how to fight and if you played games with them they would hurt they'd hurt you and the other one is 
[00:38:30]  is um buddy holly or hardcore holly sure and the other one's brock lesnar people were legitimately did  not want to make him an angry guy man he is a legit his neck a guy with a neck like that  right and a guy whose ears who does that for what he does and his ears aren't all chewed up  means it doesn't people don't get to him too long man yeah he's a scary dude well i think he's gonna  bring a a ton of interest into the ufc now that he's a champion yeah it's good for them i mean he's 
[00:39:00]  such a big name in wrestling i think it's gonna yeah it's gonna bring a lot from wrestling i think  some of these wrestling dudes are gonna be like you know what brock lesnar's now the champion i gotta  start checking out this sport and this helps wrestling because the fact that brock lesnar who  comes from this fake sport supposedly right is legitimately a tough dude that means you go okay  wrestlers are a little legitimately tough right and you might and and knowing vincent man he might make  it because years ago vincent man did a stunt where he he made boxer uh the wrestlers fight each other 
[00:39:30]  with in the ring boxing so to say okay who's really the toughest dude and you know they were they had to  go at it and uh but the the problem was some obscure dude would end up being the toughest guy  out of all of them and and uh but ultimately dude this is gonna help wrestling because people gonna  go look man brock lesnar's a wrestler he's not a soft dude he's not a fake and they just showed the uh  the the mirror uh i forgot it was it was the ankle twist yeah it was like he was gonna break his 
[00:40:00]  freaking uh ankle he was dominating him and then uh all of a sudden they're on the excuse me  the mirror gets on the ground and then just goes to the ankle and there are certain things like  these certainly to be submitted by these guys it's like all of a sudden one guy is kicking the crap  out of the other dude yeah and then you'll see the guy who was winning all of a sudden he's smacking  his arm real quick and it's because his wrist or his ankle is about to be broken off you know you have  to tap we're looking at the highlights of that fight again and the whole time he's trying to go for  the ankle he's just waiting for his opportunity it's very obvious that he's just waiting to to get that 
[00:40:30]  ankle and i in a hold and he was gonna break brock lesnar's leg he's an he's a brock lesnar's  a serious businessman and i mean quite frankly and i'm a fan of randy couture man he's a he's one of  those dudes you just want to see do well yes guy super nice guy he does his energy and stuff but um  i'd rather see him i'd rather see brock lesnar fight fator well let's see who he fights next  matt in arizona knows matt who's uh lesnar fighting so so jimmy could get to a fight at the end of the 
[00:41:00]  year they're doing their uh big showdown with no gear versus frank mir for the other title because  there's going to be have to be a unified fight because no gear also has the heavyweight title  as well right so once that goes down that fight then it's going to be whoever wins that has to  fight lesnar to kind of unify that title when couture had to take off for his uh fatal request  that he took on so that's going to be the big fight that's going to set it up so do you think that  after that happens and they they unify this title that then if they can get fator if they can even get 
[00:41:30]  him in that he will fight the winner of that but there's no there's no way i mean danis put it out  there fatal war and everything else i mean it's a pipe dream to have that happen um to have you know  it does set up lesnar now versus you know fator and you know mma you know war but like that guy  saying that couture just kind of stepped out was uh it wasn't really smart in a way because nobody  wants to see that fight now couture is getting up his age if couture beat lesnar that would probably 
[00:42:00]  make that fedor fight happen right well that's what i'm saying then now there's more interest  and they say fedor's people are very difficult to deal with but the bottom line is they want to  make money yeah and uh you know look affliction or or uh what was the uh elite xc uh you know  yeah wec yeah where's he gonna fight all the money will get to a point where of course yeah well he has  to fight somewhere able to figure this out all right thank you matt we're gonna take a break uh we're  gonna move on to other things we've got patrice o'neill in studio today gonna do a little obama 
[00:42:30]  stuff today we haven't talked to you since uh the election yeah but quite frankly before you go  i'd just like to say yep everywhere in the streets i'd be asking me with serious concern  is anthony all right he's with disappointment and pain with pain and suffering in their heart  and it's uh he's really it's quite sad he sounds like a raving lunatic i wish he was here today  raving because between you and him it'll be some great stuff and i feel bad because people are 
[00:43:00]  patrice is is anthony like almost like i know that radio is radio and it's entertainment and boy  you got to push buttons but it's almost like dude it's feeling feeling real yeah and i i say it it is  and then i walk away he's a dirty racist anthony's just scared of what and but well i just want to  let you that little part is that it's it's really i i've gotten the same thing actually on the street 
[00:43:30]  so but is everything okay he's yeah and i go ultimately this one bothered him a little bit oh  it's it's uh it's a bit bothered it's an irrational fear i come and i have and i have a little bit of  i have some some i just sometimes i just want to call in in the morning but i don't want to step over  there i just want i listen and but those phone things i just want to look him in his eyes yeah  and embrace the energy of what is in his eyes when he's talking i just want to see it before i really 
[00:44:00]  know on the radio sounds he sounds like a complete ass a complete ass because i know how smart he is  and i know he's what he's unraveling a little bit he's unraveling this is you know but i we'll get  your thoughts on the whole thing after the break okay and maybe we can wake up anthony or maybe didn't  go to bed yet we'll get him before he goes to bed i'm sure they was hunting uh they caught some um 
[00:44:30]  homeless black man somewhere and his family was hunting him down outside in the woods  i'm probably i'm pretty sure opie and anthony stay there  it's the opie and anthony shoot patrice o'neill sitting in for anthony today and then of course  you got the star of the show jim noren over there making the bestseller list i got the list in front  of me nice jimmy thank you i'm very happy very very and you beat out one of uh one of obama's books  one of obama's not too shabby my friend and a john lennon biography but i am there's some on there 
[00:45:00]  that are just like you look at who you're up against it's not like when i sold more so far  than happy endings you want to see like harry potter above you not letters to my daughter  yeah but that's maya angelic i know i mean it's her and it's uh it's it's o'reilly and it's it's  all right how about the snowball what's the snowball i've engaged in that sexually but what is the uh  thank you it's not fine i'm with you uh the life of warren buffett yeah i mean buffett buffett's  buffett and obama i mean i'm against the first black president i can't uh you know you can't 
[00:45:30]  there's certain things and there's some guy i don't know who he is he writes for the times  uh it's about the green economy and i have never heard of this i'm like who is this nerd and uh  my uh literary agent said he's unbeatable he's been on the list for three years three years like  with different books the guy is unbeatable what book has he got now something about the green  economy i mean i'm sure it's really about you know nobody wants to read that but apparently a lot  of people do and i'm just it's funny how they have like a little description of each book  with mine is uh humorous essays mostly about people norton dislikes so there you go so hopefully people 
[00:46:00]  look at the list and want to go out the number one book in america is dewey the synopsis is the  kitchen wait the kitten the kitten left freezing in the return book slot of an iowa public library  and his rise to fame this is non-fiction though like i don't know what that is but apparently it's true  that's a true story these are all non-fiction i'm not up against the kitten was left freezing  and it comes back to life or whatever it was never really dead and then it becomes famous 
[00:46:30]  i don't how do you who would want to read that that should be number one on the short story list  right like if there was a three paragraph story i'd love to read about dewey yeah but a whole book  about a stupid cat that should have been dead dewey stinks dewey sucks we hate dewey he drops logs all  over the all over the i don't know i guess they call him dewey because the dewey decimal system  probably they probably named him that they probably had to name him dewey  they should have called him guy in satin sweatshorts whacking his bag on the library  computers name him irrelevant building no one goes to visit no more exactly yeah oh look there's our 
[00:47:00]  cat shh so we got patrice o'neill uh it's pro obama day finally yes we get a word in today because  anthony is uh out he'll be back tomorrow he was celebrating his um mommy's uh 25th anniversary  that's what he said with baltimore sale see if there's any missing homeless black men  so uh a light bulb went off in my head i'm like get patrice we get to get the other side of the  story with this obama give me why he's talking president elect i well you could call it anytime 
[00:47:30]  you want you got that god damn you got that power you should have called in when he was ranting and  raven i'm just taking it in just to see what his stance was beyond the anger ultimately it's it's  nothing new to me something new to a lot of people not to me not not what he's saying but just the  attitude i already know white people fake i'm not anthony i'm happy obama's uh gonna be the next  president jimmy's very happy i'm happy i wanted him to win well believe me i'd tell you if i didn't  your mind is different though you know anthony still like i said he still wants to attach himself 
[00:48:00]  it's almost like that that keeping it real thing anthony still wants to attach himself to the  to the local schlub whose hands are busted up and the garbage man and he's not that guy anymore he  wants to so be that but he's a he's a i don't know millionaire and he's thinking there's no way he  can think see if it was about money he wouldn't be that emotional money doesn't make you scream and 
[00:48:30]  holler about taxes and stuff there's too many ways for people with money to hide money and  do goofy things this is emotional and his emotion is is touching uh dumb white people that's what  bothers me about it it's just touching white people who aren't smart enough to know that the president  uh can really do nothing to affect just one group you know it is you have to it's it's very  who affects is is policies law policies you know police can affect one group putting your hands on 
[00:49:00]  somebody it's white cops what are you going to change the infrastructure of what racism is now see  racism used to be uh it used to be legislation wise it was able you was able to be racist see the here's  the fear that anthony has and i heard it a couple of times with the uppity thing is that here's some  white people i'm gonna think as a white guy and what would make me mad you've never as a white person  had to ever answer in this country to a black guy on any way it's almost like having a dog or a kid 
[00:49:30]  whatever your way of dealing with those people your dog or your you're dealing with that you know  is crate training better than rolling up a newspaper and hit him in the face some people roll a newspaper  up hit him in the face some people crate train their dog ultimately at the end of the day  the dog doesn't get a choice you you're ultimately deciding whether that's the right way to do it or not  you know what i'm saying so for this country um white people when i say white it's it's it's 
[00:50:00]  institutional white it's not just i don't look at anybody any white dude particularly as my oppressor  it's it's this country and the and black and white people just don't want to see like even i heard a  story the other day um i was listening to the replay coming over his the thing where he's upset is that  there's some black people that all they got is to be proud of any black person that that makes it  through a system that they think has been holding them down that was the oj verdict the oj verdict had 
[00:50:30]  nothing to do with oj it was just oh man he beat that system he was a black dude that had the resources  to beat that whoa that was it that's all it was but white people don't want to see that happen  and it's and ultimately here's what i say about the race part the all the thing is this is the only  people in this country who are defined by color is white and black so really obama is half african 
[00:51:00]  who black people don't like half white who black people don't like he's he doesn't have that that  generation of institutionalized anger right he had to be that special dude to to win this but the  fact that his skin is what it is makes it the problem it is but it's also how he identifies  himself one thing just to say because you've touched on the race it's that it's it's not just  dumb white people it's it's like it's not just a matter of thinking like oh my god all black people 
[00:51:30]  are gonna run the country it's the fear that's happening with a lot of people it's this irrational  thing where it's a black face in a typically white office and it's like as irrational like you know  they said a lot of black people are unhappy and be disappointed because it's the first one a lot of white  people that are really disappointed and frightened are gonna realize oh what was i what was i worried  about it's working that way both ways like a lot of black people are too excited because they think  something is going to happen different that really isn't and a lot of white people are depressed because  they think something but those people are in the same category this is what i'm saying about 
[00:52:00]  about how we all think see i'm not i'm not eliminating black people from the problem either  because a lot of black people think that the black president is going to do something black for them  i've heard some of the goofy things but those goofy black people as just as stupid as goofy white  people who think that this is going to all this is really what this does is to me it just gives me  the opportunity because not it i want the equality to me is when a black person a mediocre black person 
[00:52:30]  can be put into a spectacular position obama had to be almost messiah like the the lore of this guy  i want to see all sorts of niggas the governor of of california i'm just looking at his face  he is mediocre from head to toe the the spectacular thing that he is is a is he was a spectacular  weightlifter he's not a spectacular guy he's not a spectacular leader his movies weren't spectacular 
[00:53:00]  they were great in terms of entertainment but he's a he's really a mediocre guy what it's just like a  black quarterback right now there's enough black quarterbacks for me to go please fire him there's  enough mediocre black coaches to go please fire him the coach from pittsburgh is a spectacular young  black coach but herm edwards has to go removed from football in terms of head coaches what has 
[00:53:30]  he done really mediocre what is her doesn't know romeo crummel uh from cleveland got to go but  that's what i want is that the next black president can't be but if they were the all things although  but if they were the only black coaches then you wouldn't say they have to go exactly that's where  if it was just one and that was it yeah then then i'll be like hey he got to stay because there's 
[00:54:00]  not any but my thing is it's all a symbol for me my what because i knew what i was watching the the  election with my girl my girl got a white mama and she goes she stands up and she just she goes yes  yes yes right and i'm like wow all right she's like yeah call me black now i go excuse me call me  black i'm like what what are you talking about you know my girl's half black half white now half black  half white girls look you know got some white things and some black things black lips white hair 
[00:54:30]  you know so she's like yeah if you're gonna call him black you call me black i go what that shit you  look like sarah palin right so i'm joking with her sarah palin with a tan she walks in the in the  room and wets her hair so it can get curly and say i don't know white people here i'm black and if  you're gonna call him black you gotta call me black she would look crazy so i'm sitting there going this  is this really means a lot to a lot of people but immediately my mind is going i but can i can i  stop so she would downsize the black part of her no she because you want to like assimilate more 
[00:55:00]  into the white world no she's upgrading now she's upgrading the black part because that but she's  she hates the way she she wants she's black but before that she would like like make sure her hair  straight and all that to maybe like fit in a little more in the white world i mean look and now that  obama's president she's like oh man i'm letting the black hang out now no all right because i'm a  little no it's it's something that only she can understand see what i'm saying it's like something  that i couldn't i was teasing her but the fact that when i said she went to wet her hair the only thing 
[00:55:30]  that made that happen is that i said wow she's serious she's dead serious that she went to go wet  her hair to say no no i'm not a white woman i'm not this i'm not that she it was something that only  someone mixed race could i still don't know what it was that made her deeply feel that way but when  i'm watching that because i was sitting there going all right what's this neck what's what do white 
[00:56:00]  people want out of this one that's the first thing i'm thinking i said why one thing i know white  people won't give it nothing for free racially it ain't happening but that's not completely the  i mean maybe again the certain institution but this guy got a lot of white people voted for him  here's what we said look first of all the it was almost split down the middle what you say 130  million people uh started voted sure it was almost even it was every black person almost every latino  person almost every jew almost every minority plus some white people yeah i don't know how many more 
[00:56:30]  than john kerry got who cares that's a lot though that's a lot and they're it's democrat and no one  and no and that was with compelling this people were compelled emotionally to vote john kerry versus  bush people just voted for what they voted for this one was all-time spectacular you didn't get white  republicans crossing party lines like white republicans voted the way exactly this was black 
[00:57:00]  republicans and and spanish republicans probably crossing party lines it was because it was bigger  than parties but ultimately it was 50 it was 60 million everybody's versus 59 million white people  to me here's the breakdown made no difference to me it was it was exactly what this country is  it just so happened to be more of the other side voted for obama that's what it was to me at the time 
[00:57:30]  yeah at the time but then i had to realize what is it going to take for me to think differently and  i realized this more uh all right more white people voted for mccain than obama really yeah  how about all no according to this obama got 43 percent of the white vote right yeah this is how  i'm reading this mccain got 55 of the white vote okay who was left uh then uh blacks 95 of uh blacks 
[00:58:00]  voting went with obama all right and about four percent um for mccain okay latino uh 67 percent went  obama okay 31 percent went mccain okay asian 62 uh 2 percent obama 35 percent mccain and then the  other was 31 31 and by the way that was the other they're just saying other yeah dude breaking down  it was everybody it was white white people voted for mccain and everybody else and some white which is 
[00:58:30]  what i'm saying is the historical nature of this country which is there'll be a few white people  who do that side let's say that if let's say if all black people everybody who all the minorities  left this country it would and the 10 million or whatever so white people that voted for obama  stayed here it would be like how to how they treat i how they treat the people in iraq the sunnis  like they would be ostracized because it's going against the country but no it's not as much as 
[00:59:00]  white people you have to like because you're like how can i look at things differently  he white people elected him as their president white people i know all the black vote all the  spanish vote but he got a lot of white people that he didn't sneak in with 10 percent white vote he got  a massive amount of that it has been the history of the country is that the same percentage of people  who would vote and again but patrice you also got to understand that the white vote is 74 percent of 
[00:59:30]  uh total voters okay yeah so you have to look at things like you don't like looking at things  but but this wasn't just a fluke that he got in this is why i'm not saying it's a fluke and said we  want him to be our president i'm not saying it's a fluke but see that's the part of it i disagree but  i mean going with uh patrice's logic even though the white uh vote was 74 percent of the total vote  like obama really need the blacks the latinos the asians and the other democrats always come out and  yeah to come out and vote yeah i'm not it's always that way republican democrat don't forget right 
[01:00:00]  always that way absolutely here's my issue is not you know the it's like this is my thing what i start  thinking deeply about is look payback and the payback is this people people are going to want something  out of this and what what white people are going to want out of this is the end of racism  the end of black people talking about slavery and talking about race and talking about uh it 
[01:00:30]  haven't you look at where you've come and and that's the thing that this country doesn't understand  uh even with jeremiah right why black people want to accept with him is because we understand what  that is we live here we we make it we do this and we do that but we do it despite this country and  it's not you and it's not you but you think you of yourself as a white guy opie you think of yourself  as a white guy norton but you might your family may have never had anything to do with slavery 
[01:01:00]  ever but the fact is what this country has set up meaning you're gonna feel white your color  oppresses my color and wait a minute black people have never ever have found a way to forgive  this country it there's that's the that's the problem and that's what's going to change this  country is when black people are able to forgive the united states there's no place to forgive you  but you can't look at something like white people only voted for him because they want it to be 
[01:01:30]  the end of black complaining i mean to put it in a nutshell with how would i ever know maybe some  white people um but you're not saying that any people are like yeah i like this guy symbolically i like  what it is but i also think it's like you don't realize that white people we're not again you get  i'm not even just me and opie white guys but other white guys we're not just a bunch of hayseeds  running around going well we voted one in everything's right now right no see that's not i'm not i'm not  i'm not marginalizing people's minds like that like people will look at this and go it's a step in the 
[01:02:00]  right it's a positive you think there are men who work with women right as dudes women who work every  day in an office with a woman right and he just wants to squeeze her boob yeah or grab her boot and the only  thing stopping him really is hr can't do it hr hr before hr he got away with that that's a little  pinch line thank you that okay and that's why the women in the office uh place they now direct dress  sexier because they know no one's gonna no one's gonna touch they're not button up anymore buttoning 
[01:02:30]  up anymore because they got someone protecting them and that cleavage is all flowing in the uh workplace  a lot of white people i'm not saying all anything i'm saying a lot of white people racism being a racist  is the worst thing the very worst thing that you can be accused of as a white person now and so bad  that you know what even if i'm racist i might vote for obama just so i can make sure that if something  comes down and i'm accused of being racist that you can't call me that because i voted for obama 
[01:03:00]  ultimately dude you gotta understand norton the relationship between black and white people in  this country is based on your superiority mentally and over over black people and that has never  changed see when the jews was free from bondage if you if the jew the jews story is biblical if you  watch the damn 10 commandments at the end of the day the pharaoh really wanted to kill him he came  down he wanted to say you know what i freed him but i'm gonna go murder him rode down there with his 
[01:03:30]  chariots the red sea opened up washed him all away he went back home and was like hey look and his wife  was like did you kill him he's like look his god is god the god freed the jews uh god the how we live  our lives is based on how the jews were free basically the 10 commandments most of us that's the the mantra  of how we live our lives it was a special story they're the chosen people they're there it's it's  closure there's a villain which is the pharaoh in egypt there's a beginning the middle there's an end 
[01:04:00]  it's over they don't have to continue to hate vagueness how we were freed it was paperwork if you read  the emancipation proclamation which is is is the is the is the uh the document that freed the slaves  it's nothing but making black people go to war and in the third paragraph is like hey go to go  report to something yeah but in that war i get it we've talked about it many many times so how do we  solve this because i'll tell you there's no way for white people to solve that thank you that's what 
[01:04:30]  i added a statement right there no but i'll tell you something because like uh the average white person  doesn't think of the slavery thing like you guys do of course you don't and i know and and as a white  person i can tell you i just worry about my own struggles i can give a crap about your struggles or  anybody else because i had it tough growing up i my struggles were against the system it wasn't  a color and as i could continue to be uh very successful in my life i have a lot of people  in my family that are still struggling and that's what i focus my attentions on if i could give a 
[01:05:00]  crap about the slave of course if i punch you in your face every day right and then i just stop but  that's why i don't know how this ever works itself out how it works itself out because we got our own  struggles i can't be bothered with worrying about easy for you letting that making that slave thing  completely go away it's me it's easy for your skin color to move on but it's not easy i got you i got  brothers that are still struggling because of the system not because of slavery or you're talking 
[01:05:30]  about personal experience well that's what we all look but this is not this is bigger than personal  experience you're not going to get whitey self on that exactly how do we figure this out this is why  ultimately we you're not this is what i'm saying white people's idea that they're going to figure  this out is the ultimate arrogance of it is that i'm doing my part to help the only way we don't even  think that the only way that black people are going to really move on is to find closure for 
[01:06:00]  ourselves right because we're not going to get it from all right so again how do we how do we get to  that point who i don't know how see i got my thing is i got again personal experience you're my friend  you know you're my friend it's like but i don't i dislike white people but i don't see you as a white  dude you're norton but i'm talking about what this country does and what your skin color is in this  country and the thing and i don't i don't i can't nobody black is going to relate to hey man you know 
[01:06:30]  the system it's like yeah what taxes or something else or something i'm talking about oppression i'm  talking about a country who did something to a people who never ever said that this is wrong  now i live with the legacy of the skin and you live with the legacy of the skin and it's still that way  we have never mentally for the color never mentally been moved on but this country hasn't moved on 
[01:07:00]  country has said yeah there's more than more than symbolically the way things have changed in the  last x amount of years i'm not saying that that erased what we get stuff black presidents it's not  that it's it's the way people look at things it's the interactions people have you can't write it off  as just like you painted it like all of a sudden like all white people still think the same way no  and uh nothing has changed no and uh what has changed like everything uh perceptions the way 
[01:07:30]  people interact people's desire just to live with each other and not have any of this crap that was  going on for for all these years that has changed a lot and it hasn't been force-fed you can't just  say that everybody who is pro-obama or is pro all this stuff are being force-fed uh and reluctant  uh or looking at black people in negative ways it's just not true let me ask you this  if do you agree it's getting better do i agree it's getting better i don't know  i'll tell you why we we we did a show on friday we're moving on from that but we learned that like 
[01:08:00]  in your lifetime you're in your early 40s or so or getting there right so you went from blacks went  from not voting to having the first black president do you in your life stand i'm just asking what i'm  saying do you understand the slave thing's not even on my radar but do you understand i got i got my  own issues that we understand i worry about for me everybody have their own personal issues right  and black don't and here's the thing that that it's like that black people haven't moved on 
[01:08:30]  we haven't moved on we have moved on it's the fact is that to really end it we need closure  closure mentally because this summer the congress did apologize formally  for slavery but you said it doesn't mean anything do you understand start is no it's not a start no  because a white guy who a bunch of white guys who decide this was bad it it goes this is what i'm 
[01:09:00]  saying that you can do nothing about it because we have to go back in time to where the wrongness  happened to where like it it the wrong see you don't you ultimately dude there's a feeling that black people  have that's not going to be changed by apologies or money or anything it's a forgiveness that we don't  have for the country that white people can say hey man i i got my problems we know because that's human 
[01:09:30]  problems issues your mama's sick your feet hurt we understand i'm talking about as a people that this  country has done nothing but wrong and the people i think in 1950 if there was a black candidate he might  have still won if in 1950 the clan wasn't allowed to just beat somebody's ass at the voting booth i think  there have been enough people to vote a black president then i don't think my thing is the inside 
[01:10:00]  how people feel i don't care about the trinkets of just here you go here you go here's a president  here's this doesn't that see the change look how far you've come what but it's not just that it's not  just that that's the point i'm making that if that was the way everybody thought you'd be right but  everybody is not looking at it like here you are child take this i under you don't want white  paternalism you don't want white paternalism and fair enough nobody would want that it's insulting 
[01:10:30]  but that's not the way it is for all people and that's what i'm saying you can't look at it like  everyone is just looking at it like well here's your little gift slavery's over pat on the head  take care guys that's not the way all people are looking at it we're not again i'm gonna say this  one more time it's not all people we look this is what i'm saying dude the arrogance that white  people put themselves anytime the word white is said that you would put yourself in a category  to understand see how you understand the white point of view norton's that that hey this is not 
[01:11:00]  what we all this is it you gotta understand there's a new kind of racism man it's lying this is why i  appreciate anthony you can't expect but you can't say white and expect other white people to not react  anymore that if some people say black you're gonna react it's just it's you you can't paint it like  where black people can react one way to the whole country and it can all feel the same thing  right their skin color and yet you can criticize white people and of course white people are gonna  get react but the color that we're talking about is the same color that messes with your family when 
[01:11:30]  you say you have your problems and you're worried about your family and things that's the white that  black people are talking about that's why black people are closer to having this racial thing and  then white people because we live we live in a country norton okay where really we've never felt  like anything's changed even though okay you're allowed to do this is almost it's insulting but it's 
[01:12:00]  generational thing it's like we're living it and i said this to anthony too in hindsight this is going  to be a blip on the radar like oh yeah that's when things were all of a sudden different but in a real  generational life like we're living at real time so it's not going to be finished in our lifetimes  but we're living at real time it is happening relatively quickly when you look where something  happened if you're living in the 40 year period you're like who cares now i'm allowed to do this  where's the internal where's the internal change of all this the internal the difference in your life 
[01:12:30]  the difference that makes you go damn this is this was foul and move on see it's easy to move on  when you wait it's not easy to move on when you feel the same way in this country and now  the covertness of it is hard to you can't prove it before all we did all we could do was be relate to 
[01:13:00]  lynching dogs hoses and and and and and george wallace now it's who me i don't know so basically  what we have left like i said jews had hitler and his mustache and his friends we have white color  i know you got a color white that's it all right we'll come up with the solution then there's there's  the the one that's that's what i asked you today it's generational it's not going to happen now it's a 
[01:13:30]  slow again 500 years from now people look back they'll go oh yeah you know in 2000 they'll probably  just call 2000 uh all of a sudden over 2000 they had a black president and all things will be  different because you'll have a 50 or 100 year span to look at it in real time when you're living  something right it seems like it's slow and nothing is that wasn't longer than 2000 that's a pretty good  point jimmy's making by the way longer than 2000 years was moses because jesus was 2000 years ago  yeah before that was the moses was was the old testament we gotta break we'll go to break we'll 
[01:14:00]  continue the phones are lit uh you got them reacting today patrice so we'll continue with  this discussion just a bit 877-212-ON-A you're not going to get in now but maybe a little later  if you want to add to this opie and anthony  man we are discussing today we got the black version of anthony in studio today  holy ass gotta acknowledge that wow i for one i'm i'm very excited obama's the president just  because i think he's the right man for the job all right simple as that and uh we've discussed the 
[01:14:30]  black white thing and i'm sitting here really thinking about it and i don't know what you could  say to make me understand because i just didn't you can't i didn't i didn't i didn't live this i don't  know anybody that let me ask let me ask this to the ladies if if there was a woman president right  if there was a woman president and uh all women would just be proud to see that as a woman there's  no way you couldn't be proud now as a dude you know i dismiss women has shut up but let's say you 
[01:15:00]  ask a woman what's this mean to you and wait where have you come now a woman ago this is a start  this is this is definitely a start in the right direction but there's a lot of things kind of  like jackie robinson was jackie robinson and then i say to a woman i go what a start it's done shut up  abortion i don't want to hear about it no more you think the black president a lot of white people  are going to look at it like all right even steven now what yeah where else what else can you people 
[01:15:30]  complain about if if they do so what but so what if they do that what that's what i mean  ultimately ultimately i don't like your wife no kidding man i bend over backwards do you really  think uh whitey has it uh easy in this country i i know you i don't understand what i'm saying  because you're saying that to me but i know yeah exactly because i know you think whitey has it a lot  easy i know that being white probably makes it easier in this country i'm not stupid but it's still 
[01:16:00]  effing hard for us too okay but at least you're not me but that's why i don't i'll never understand  this because i know the struggles that that i i'll say it again that i have my family has i got i got  people in my family working two jobs trying to pay bills that's all they care let's go back to don't  give a crap what you or your people your people sorry like that have been through let's go back to  where white people in this country were different from each other what was that about stone brain 1901 
[01:16:30]  yeah when there was wops mix this that third that sure sure ultimately you would have understood  then but but see this is what i'm saying now because i'm in the hearing now but because you're not in the  hearing now see this is the thing white people erase historical value from this country and it's about  moving on nobody says to a jew it's not the holocaust but patrice get over it but i'm i'm 
[01:17:00]  really trying to simplify this it's not about it's not it's not it's our it's it's our day-to-day  struggle for and i mean for me and my family and close friends that's what i guess that's my world  because i can't be bothered and worry about what slavery has done to you are you irish you're irish right  i'm a mutt i'm seriously i'm everything let's say if your blood was irish if you was purebred irish  and it didn't go into the direction of color where irish people kind of feel superior polish people 
[01:17:30]  feel superior based on the color historically man the color is the issue obama is not a black dude  he ain't a black dude he's black by his skin color do you understand what this country is  is based on color and it's not gonna change as a white guy you deal with things that people deal 
[01:18:00]  with what do you mean he's not a black dude i'm not sure what you mean he's not well he's not like  flavorful dude he let me oh i'll tell you what i watch dl hewley's show i'm being he's not like a  flavorful he's like that's like saying john kerry's not white because he's not he's not uh you know  what i'm saying like no no no it's not the same i'm gonna tell you why i'll tell you something  black africans right i saw i watched dl hewley's show um on cnn and uh he interviewed these africans  from kenya and africans you should have seen this interview they i got so mad because they  took credit see africa does not associate themselves with black america they go he is he is the first 
[01:18:30]  generation kenyan what are you dl hoogly wouldn't even pronounce the name right africans  make me sick do you know this was going on yeah exactly because you're white and you don't need  to know how would we know i don't need to know africans don't tell us anything that we know so  how many africans do i know mr hoogly mr hoogly you are here 70 generations and look what you did 
[01:19:00]  nothing and look at wait we import don't tell me to wait we have we export we export presidents to  your country africans embrace this as him he's not meaning this uh jesse jackson's son would be the  black president now obama is the black president because of skin not because of of of history historic  value and wow this dude is black and i don't mean he's he's black like he don't have rhythm or 
[01:19:30]  something the dude is half white half african he's seen it but he's seen again it's all perception  he lives as a black male thank you he's seen as a black we're saying the same thing i know but i'm  saying is you're looking at the internal stuff but he is seen as as a black man in this country's eyes  in this country said he's a black they're not looking at like jesse jackson's son right well he's  blacker or more black american he's half the country looked at a black guy with the name 
[01:20:00]  barack obama and said we like this guy but you know what i mean it was like we like this guy we  want him to be our president and i i know it sounds cheesy i'm not saying it erases everything but it is  what it is it is what it is but that's what my problem is i guess i'm being utopian about it  is that is what it is to me is very scary because ultimately the only thing that can keep slavery from  happening again i was talking to my mother like hey mom what if what if uh they just the country 
[01:20:30]  just decided to go hey look we don't have enough money we need free labor sorry uh black folks we  we got to reinstitute slavery now ultimately hypothetically that's so that's ridiculous  of course it is but why is it based on what is that ridiculous other than oops uh it's not going to  happen but if they needed free labor to build this country up again in terms of for his money  and they said black people we have to reinstitute slavery ridiculous what would happen it's ridiculous  based on the idea that it's ridiculous what are we going to do with all the mexicans then 
[01:21:00]  exactly sorry that's what i'm sorry mexicans we have to do we have to joke that i'll tell you why  it's ridiculous we have to no you know i'll tell you why it's ridiculous because the world's a different  place information is that why it's ridiculous because the world you think the world meaning  slavery let's be honest when it happened was happening all over the world it was happening  it was accepted all over the world it does happen maybe in sudan a certain place it's not an acceptable 
[01:21:30]  practice in the world now the word you said is acceptable jim yeah this is what i mean this is my  thing everything is acceptable acceptable behavior you could beat your kids when i was growing up  your parents could beat the dog doo-doo out of their kids that was acceptable why did they stop  some parents still want to beat the dog doo-doo throw their kids through a window and they stop  because beating your kids is done socially but my thing is i would love it to feel done i i would i don't  want somebody to think that by the graces of like i'm lucky you by the graces of not god or the graces of 
[01:22:00]  not anything bigger than uh a group feeling like they're giving other things to another group do i  want that that's always the way it will be numerically then you can't you put you're putting  into a no-win situation because the bottom line is unless there are an even number of people in a  country if you want to look at it like that that means any time in any country that the smaller group  is not enslaved by the larger group that it's simply a bunch of bullcrap and they're being polite 
[01:22:30]  it doesn't make sense that way that's that's not the reality that doesn't say that the world is a  different place like i know women are happy that guys don't run around like caveman days and just  hit them on top of the head and drag them with their hair but i think i think that could come back  someday dude his this is my analogy that because my girl called me a black supremacist like when we  was watching she was like you're just the same as the rest of them  but i thought it took her understanding as a woman to get it it's like this if you come in the house 
[01:23:00]  right and you beat your wife punch her in the face every day yeah and she stands there right and you  just that's the part of life you can be the ass and nothing she can say one day you come in and you  don't punch her she don't say nothing she's just not getting punched she's like whoo then a month  goes by you just stop punching her then one day you come in with flowers you give her flowers and  then she goes you have a moment you go um why did you she goes why did you stop punching me and you go 
[01:23:30]  ah you know a lot of my friends was getting arrested for punching their wives so i didn't want to get  arrested i just didn't punch you in your face no more and and she goes what wait a minute the only  reason you stop punching me is because you might get in trouble for doing it and ultimately i know  you're not getting punched but the idea that someone's not there's it's not a heartfelt thing  and that's how most people stop doing that's the original stop that's the original stop and then 20 
[01:24:00]  years later if husbands all over are still not punching their wives right the wives can't go you're  only not hitting me so you don't go to jail because it goes beyond that where it's like all but you  know what here's the point it's still at the mercy of social acceptance numerically it will always be  that then then you're putting into a situation where you where no one can win because that's a  numerical game and that's why i'm saying white people have no way to help it's only and i don't 
[01:24:30]  know the answer because i want to forgive and what i mean by forgive is when a white dude says hey man  you know hey you're really articulate or you you you're smart i want to go thanks dude but in me  i go will you validate my intelligence cracker i'm better than you you didn't think that there was a  you didn't think obama was gonna win you thought he had no shot no and all of a sudden until i start  reading and then you start okay i remember the call you're like i think this guy has a real shot  because of the electoral vote now i'm very happy i'm very happy he won the popular yes because if he 
[01:25:00]  didn't win the popular and he won the electorate like i said white people when when the answers  you think you got the answers we'll change the questions they would have changed the electoral  that didn't happen what happened was he got the majority he got a good majority of the vote but he  did and he got the electoral it was a completely legitimate it was a fairly i mean it was a pretty  overwhelming compared to where the elections have gone mccain even said in his concession he said  and the country has spoken they've spoken clearly i mean it was it was a beating that is what see how i 
[01:25:30]  felt at mccain watching mccain's acceptance speech he was great in concession speech mccain was great  with that how i felt was what is what it'll take for me to forgive is like to see somebody that a white  guy old white man just something about him just felt like he he wanted to go i'm sorry i'm sorry he  looked like he wanted to go look man i knew he was better going in i would have voted for him if i  have to go through this nonsense of being mr old white man this guy is better and you know it and 
[01:26:00]  i know it boo but that's typical politics like that's that wasn't a typical political speech  no no but the bully they always do that they don't always boo  you mentioned the opponent in the concession speech what no they always always every concession  speech it's always the guy like you know everyone yeah my opponent ran a better campaign  go back in history that everyone do you every every time we elect a new president i'm gonna go with 
[01:26:30]  you guys on this this is what i'm saying to bring it to what i'm what i want to feel i don't want to  feel like they booed the black guy recently boo the black guy but do you understand they were  booing that their feelings they were booing that their guy they worked so hard for is not gonna be  the problem and they believe that's what you say i'm telling you all right that's what you say 
[01:27:00]  every election you're paranoia i i don't understand  just because i'm paranoid don't mean somebody ain't trying to kill me you're right but that  let me tell you something you're paranoia and and i don't understand because i don't live your life  i so don't see it that way don't see it that way but do you understand you see it that way and i don't  and i see it differently that's why i want to see it differently that's my whole thing to me it was so 
[01:27:30]  obvious they were booing because their man did not win they booed became an obama mentioned him  they do that you white white this country let me stop saying forget what this country dismisses  black people's feeling every as paranoia when they but just because white people dismiss black people's  feelings of paranoia it doesn't mean that they never are the same thing i do it doesn't mean that  they never are they boo every concession speech right everyone hold on let me jump in let me jump in  they boo the other guy you're 100 right by me saying you're paranoid by by uh saying that you're 
[01:28:00]  100 right i said it the wrong way but i'm just saying like i saw one way you saw another way to  but to not see that doing to say that he's paranoid over that you know what maybe that is going a little  can we can we go can we go to oj verdict what did you what did you feel norton what did you feel  black was going on with black people when that verdict was read and we was running i thought they were  insane originally because i was it was 1994 you're talking 14 years ago i personally have gotten 
[01:28:30]  more knowledge and understand things a little better but in 94 i'm like they're going they're  they're they're cheering i did not understand why did you think we all did it at the same time  it was like no one got a cell phone call in the moment you look at it you're asking what i thought  about in the moment you look at it i was actually shocked how naive i was i was shocked that he was  acquitted but when you when you look at it like all right black people are all cheering for this  internally you know that they're not a bunch of people cheering that a lady got a throat cut 
[01:29:00]  that didn't make any kind of sense because the reaction was too immediate and it was too 100%  and 100% this way um and then you realize like you know as you know with the shock of the acquittal  because it was it really was a case where the guy was obviously guilty um all right well they're  cheering i figured they were cheering for cochran more than anything and the fact that uh a guy like  cochran out slicked like like almost like this is what it feels like like do you get it now this is 
[01:29:30]  what it feels like for it to be so obvious and still go wrong wait you really thought they were  cheering for cochran back not in the moment i didn't when it was first happening it was an anger  or it was a shock because i really was shocked that he was acquitted again we've never had a trial  that we all watched right day to day like this right this you know no one's ever seen a murder  trial unfold so completely on television like a soap opera so we all kind of knew what happened  and then for it to go the other way i wasn't thinking like what racially and and then as time 
[01:30:00]  went on i was like that's what it was i was so confused you're 100 right you're 100 right i was so  confused by that i was like what it made me try to get more knowledge because i was like i didn't  understand it in the slightest why they were cheering did not understand what you guys you  now education makes you able to think and be logical sometimes reading doesn't help you be  logical i don't like people who read like some people think because they read something and they  recite what they read back to you that that makes them wonderfully intelligent right i like people who 
[01:30:30]  think so you got your intelligence and then you went and thought about it i tried yeah because  obviously what was going on that i was naive to that uh the the black man was being screwed over  in the judicial system how can white people not this is how in 94 i had no effing idea that was  going on this is how wonderfully lucky this country is because guess what i read a bunch of articles  after that i went wow all right this is where this is coming from i i'm not sure if i like agreed 
[01:31:00]  but i'm like okay at least have more knowledge on why the reaction was such can you believe like  anthony i'm talking about he the president now right i heard that one and i'm like we laughed  at him it's hilarious because i i mean jimmy and i live in new york i i have to say it again you know  some of the hardcores will kill me on this one but i am not seeing what anthony why would any white  person i'm just not seeing it understanding the history which means a lot of white people don't need  to know the history of this country don't need to know so why would any white person who didn't know 
[01:31:30]  any history not have a you have to read books and learn about the history of this country to say  you know what damn all they're doing is saying obama now for what this country did that's all  they're doing they can't have that one i don't do it i don't want to get white people your record is a  million and oh but i don't want to get away from the fact that you were talking about the booing  because yeah that much of what you're saying a lot of what you're saying is very correct  and i know it's correct but that is like when you're looking at something that way and you're 
[01:32:00]  going into that extreme of it you are looking at it wrong and exactly that but i'm admitting it  norton i want to be able to i want to be see there's been enough black mayors who've done some  really ridiculous things uh uh uh kwame the one in newark sharp james uh uh uh marion berry smoking  crack there's been some black mayors who've done enough things to where if a white mayor is running  against a black guy i go hey it's a it just has to be enough black people doing enough things for 
[01:32:30]  me to give back people white people the benefit of the doubt well and it's hard to do that's what i  was saying the other day we're talking about this and the bottom line is presidential elections in  once every four years it's going to be a historical view it's not going to happen in any lifetime  yeah say 200 years from now when they look at a hundred year block of time we have 25 more elections  after this obama election uh let's just say of the 25 elected presidents six are black 19 are white 
[01:33:00]  well let's be or five okay five and 20 however you want to look at it what five out of 20 will be  black presidents let's let's say over the next hundred years here's what here's what 100 is going to be  one of these things is not like the other in a hundred years you're you're you're wrong there's  of course there will be a jewish president in a hundred years the way the the global economy is  all becoming one this yes this world hate jews they hate jews for 10 000 years i understand that  but look where look at look at the high level guys like bloomberg and guys like uh uh lieberman 
[01:33:30]  i'm telling you it's gonna happen and once it happens once like you said it's not as big a deal  anymore in a hundred years will they look back and say that there were four or five black presidents  a hundred year period from this point no absolutely absolutely you think the next there'll  be five presidents in a hundred five black president 100 years uh out of 25 elections are you out your  mind norton why not why not it's not gonna happen i i why not if obama is is a good president and it 
[01:34:00]  just becomes would you have thought that way there was going to be x amount of black mayors or x amount  of uh like you said the first one x amount of black players or x amount of black anything once it  happens once like you said the first one symbolic yeah then then it just becomes something that is a  part of the country fair enough i wish i could be a vampire to know i really wish that's not even  being that positive saying five elections or you want to go four out of the next hundred years i think  the possibility is right it's not a crazy it's not a crazy thought patrice at all dude this is this is 
[01:34:30]  again i'm gonna say to you guys i really this is this is why i i exhume you from responsibility  i really want to feel that way i can think that way and i can agree with logic but we're talking  i'm in the middle of being a reasonable logical person and feeling how i feel all right so and i'm  telling you how you feel he says five presidents in the next hundred years will be black how many you  think none we're gonna go a hundred years without another black president because here's my theory on 
[01:35:00]  what the racial problem is going to be this is what my problem is with this one i'm telling you  there's an internal healing that has to happen there has to be some in internal stoppage to this  external things it doesn't see here's the thing i don't think like sports is different sports you go  hey man that n-word could run fast and we need somebody who can run fast on a team hey man this that  in the third but in terms of okay this black man is the best to run this country right now that would 
[01:35:30]  have to say that internally that this country will change in a hundred years i don't i don't think it  to be so you also didn't think obama was gonna win no i know the day before and now that he has one  you're still finding reasons as to why it's like do you do you feel what do you understand i have to  stop you every time there's a there's an arrogant white statement and i'm not let me let me finish  this without maliciousness that is an arrogant statement that i'm still finding reasons you are 
[01:36:00]  dismissing no i'm not you're jumping on the first part of the sentence i used meaning you're still  finding reasons as to why it's all negative and so but yeah you really do that you rigged the game  in your own mind patrice you've rigged the game in your own mind where first the guy's not going to  win he can't win right and then he wins and you you have no change of thought whatsoever it's almost  like okay but at least you that's not an arrogant you know what made me think he had a chance to win 
[01:36:30]  is the last ditch effort osama i mean osama barack hussein obama running for president right black dude  father left his home right smoked dick coke all the whole thing the last ditch effort the day before  which made me what made me believe is that white people or or the republicans thought he was gonna 
[01:37:00]  win because his last ditch effort was his poor black auntie yeah in boston i said this dude is gonna  win the republicans because they all they got they knew he was gonna win that i think the republicans  all along worried he was gonna win i think that's why they put a 72 year old guy instead of one of the  young future of the republican parties against them i think they knew he was they didn't want to lower  someone's stock yeah like a guy like mitt ron which is somebody who's right more stock i think 
[01:37:30]  politically that they realize it's time this there's gonna be a black president mccain and that  moron from alaska that's who they throw out there i think they knew that he was virtually unbeatable  and he would only damage any young great republic but when you say he threw him out there that means  but he had to be voted to be the representative of the republic but i still think the republicans  understood uh on some level that this guy and again i don't think anybody said look he's unbeatable  let's but i think everybody looked at obama you think psychologically that some of this stuff's 
[01:38:00]  going on i i believe i think everybody looked at this guy and just saw what he was  and saw this this jfk vibe he had to him and know this guy is going to be because he has no record  well yeah that hurts him because he's inexperienced but it also hurts him because there's very little  to attack like if you're going to run one of your young really hot republicans give him four years  and then at least you have a record you can go after there's no record all you're going after now  is obama as this iconic figure which he was before he and i think they intuitively understood that  i really do you seem like an unbeatable guy these phones are just they're just chomping and we 
[01:38:30]  gotta get a break we just can't get to him which is we'll try after the break you all right  what you all right what'd you call me i said you're all right i thought he called me in  my bag no she's great it's only what everybody's thinking i'm messing with you i'm still a comedian  i would never do it to your face what's wrong with that what do you think i would stupid i might  be naive about black culture but i know when to say it and when not i was ready to call patrice 
[01:39:00]  for the record i uh invited patrice to my wedding so i um i should be arriving about  i'm going to give you your own table though i might give you a table with my uncle tom  oh jesus i really do have an uncle tom so i'm getting a new tent uh just to drive into philly  that day nice the other thing is opie and anthony by the way jim norton discussion yeah it's like 
[01:39:30]  people don't understand how many how many black people and white people get along like in las  vegas like there's a comedy festival right i happen to be doing a show me not now but it's important  it's about race next friday at seven o'clock i'm doing the comedy festival caesar's palace it's not  about that or my ac dates in january you want to go see me at atlantic city go ahead but it's  about racial healing and that's what i'm trying to talk about not me oh my god the phones are lit  so i think patrice is hoping for something that just obviously isn't going to happen in your 
[01:40:00]  lifetime from white because we were talking about it during the break but uh nothing you can do just  stay what you are we've come a long way remember i told you about heraldo and and what they would  have it would oh that's what i want to say and i forgot yeah it it's like we all realize that  there's race and racial problems and racial issues in this country but the only people who  ever say and admit that they have racial feelings is black people i can't find i agree an intelligent  white person who admits to being racist i agree so when i watch heraldo it would always be remember 
[01:40:30]  back in the day heraldo had a show it would always be a frothing at the mouth cracker versus  uh dr leroy smith the the head of psychology at negro university disgusting race with a guy that  goes you know what you know why we're better than you because you get sickle cell anemia and we don't  not just a smart white guy who who is who is like yeah a regular person who will go yeah black people 
[01:41:00]  uh i agree with you yet you annoy me sometimes yeah i just admit a great there's no gray area white  person where it's like it's either you're a crazed lunatic or i don't see color i couldn't agree  more yes i couldn't agree more it sickens liars that's what the problem is black people got over  it quite well we're getting over it despite everything we're doing quite fine let me ask  you something patrice uh you got two obama supporters in studio today all right why do you  think we uh support obama i don't know tell me no but he's asking your opinion why do i think 
[01:41:30]  support obama because you're rational and you're and education because i'm i feel guilty no no i don't  think you feel guilty but you know why again we're talking it's just like the money we might make in  this business when you explain it to somebody who works hard and if you complain and go oh man i made  this much last week and you complain the average square is going to go i'll kill you if you complain 
[01:42:00]  about that kind of money but it's the same thing with what we do we're honest for a living opie you  where we we have we attach ourselves mentally to our feelings a lot of people don't have the ability  to attach rationale and reason to their feelings and that's what makes them what they are i'm trying  to be logical along with how i feel that's how i'm able to function if i was only emotional  there'll be problems real problems but what's problems i have now so why i think you and norton 
[01:42:30]  did is because you live you try to live as honest as you can and so for you to lie about how you might  feel about obama means you'll lie about anything and your whole stelo's not to lie but look at what  you do for a living every day for five hours you're trying to be honest about things so you're not setting  yourself up to be a hypocrite and you're not political that's why i think you two voted for 
[01:43:00]  him and i'm not saying that every other white person voted for him for something different but  i'm saying when you're not i didn't vote by the way just for the record you didn't no i didn't i didn't  you you led with why do you think we voted for him we supported him yeah if you voted for him i think  you might support him because of that because you're rational and and and despite whatever you might  have felt you would have you could make a decision based on on on being reasonable and i don't think 
[01:43:30]  everybody has the ability now to be reasonable i think more do than you think though you're right  now everybody doesn't but i think more do you think but i do agree with that flothing at the  mouth racist and even as a white guy it is hard to pull out of other white people other any racial  feelings at all and i know racial is the good word see every time you hear race with white people  they think is racist racial racial exists having racial fears is okay it happens but you have a  lot of people who admits it not many people you're right i'm white people don't admit it no and i see 
[01:44:00]  it on stage by their oh and it makes me nuts whenever you mention racial fear or racial discomfort  because everybody has moments of it they interpret it as i'm a racist if i admit that what you just said  is what i'm talking about with this election is a bunch of people who can go oh oh you don't oh  we're just going to voting oh we got to come up with a different word because racial is too close  to racist and that's why probably yeah dude i'm i'm but you voted for obama because he's black 
[01:44:30]  you pretty much admitted that on the show either but yeah yeah if i went on because i just want to  see it if you went on stage patrice is a black comic in front of a white audience you'll tell white  people they annoy you and they'll laugh and if i went on and said you know black people annoy me  sometimes white people would be very uncomfortable black people would try to much and here's why i  set myself up to try to not be a hypocrite because i hate i used to have arguments with with white  comics all the time and i used to look i try to approach it without it being taking advantage of 
[01:45:00]  white guilt i try to make it real and try to make myself a villain sometimes you see me perform  i try to make myself a villain so that i'm not endearing so that when i say it that white people  can be upset rousing success exactly that's what i'm saying by the way for the record because anthony's  not here uh when you ask him why mccain he would say because you know he believes in mccain's policies  overall of course i'll say but yeah but i'm just saying it is valid when he talks about and he could 
[01:45:30]  back it up because he starts spewing some stuff the nra he's a big nra guy and look obama's tax  policy it's like yeah it is a big thing though he wouldn't be this animalistic probably not right  if it was a white guy that won but he'd be closer to this animal i guarantee how long you guys been  working together or uh 14 14 years yeah we started with the oj uh thing clinton was in office for six  years eight eight years eight and no no six years at that time meaning six more years clinton was in 
[01:46:00]  office during that time was he ever out of his mind like he is now and there's a democratic we  didn't really he didn't make the money back then either we we yeah we've we've grown over the years  we didn't talk politics back in 94 but now his growth is based on saying uppity n words that we've  that he's goofy enough to think that black people what here's the thing in all fairness don't you think  we just give a black dude who doesn't know any better give him that in all fairness yeah like 
[01:46:30]  it's not here he'll have a lot to say about this tomorrow but what we need to do is get you both in  studio at the same time to really have at it no that's a good point because it's not fair to it's easy  you know no you're looking at an empty mic over there so that's what the hell i've been listening  to i understand but i i we got to give him this guy opportunity to defend what he's saying you know  the uppity n word she bumped into me and how dare she it's white entitlement but you still won't say 
[01:47:00]  you racist you liars that's a good point about uh if the guy is yelling obama's president like that's  just he's goofy it's such a haunting silly thing exactly but you know what that is not defending that  kid but i'm gonna say that the dude he would have found anywhere he would have been like he would  have said jesse jackson bought new shoes it just is something that you can go he's busting your balls  the black president let me uh we're gonna go to the phones because these guys have been holding 
[01:47:30]  some of them for over an hour and i i'm gonna do it this way patrice because uh you know i'm i'm a  smart radio show host i could i could like you know unleash i know i could i could just pick the  call wait how many what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go from top to bottom do your thing whatever we get  we get okay i gotta stick i'll poke you with back shut up shut up down let's start with dave in  illinois dave what's up buddy hey how you doing man hey good patrice yeah it is you you think that 
[01:48:00]  i i'm getting a vibe from you that it's the same vibe i'm getting from your voice all right  give a shot i'm gonna give him a shot but you can i already smell it i'm not stacking the deck  we're going from top to bottom let's go dave no no no what i'm saying is is that you believe that  any white guy that voted for voted for mccain and they were against obama had it had some kind  racial undertone for doing so you know what dave dave let me ask you a question dave dave let me 
[01:48:30]  ask you a question i said in this room i don't want to feel that way but i don't i do not think  that that was the case and i really don't feel that was the case but for the most part i'm generalizing  you dave i am grouping you in with all of you oh is it not mr white man do you hear yourself  you know what do you hear white people all right do you hear fairness but that's i i it's not 
[01:49:00]  nine it's not easily nine out of ten guys would say exactly what dave just said easily yeah because  we don't we don't his name is dave he's not we don't he's not uncle sam he's dave he's just a guy  from illinois nine out of ten do you get what i'm saying no this how dare fairness so what be a part  of white people's speech so what's not fair as far as your concern patrice because when you say the  same statement when it comes to stuff here's the here's the what i mean about it's not fair 
[01:49:30]  he's he's he's saying that my generalizing of white people is not fair he's right but it's not fair  that's what i'm good but like here's the thing and i've always said this on the news and it's a  game play it's hilarious to me is that when they go oh three black men robbed a walmart and shot  and raped everybody they rarely say black man but but but when a black guy does something  it is held over all of our heads even though even though it may not count against but the country 
[01:50:00]  makes it feel like all black we got to defend ourselves but when let's i let's say the green  let's say gary whatever is a guilt whatever the green river killer you probably know his name norton  i forgot his name but the green river killer in seattle kills 50 hookers ultimately one guy killing  50 people of the same thing we should be looking at that person as oh boy it's more likely that this  is or john wayne gacy if i'm a young white dude i should be looking at any chubby white guy and go 
[01:50:30]  he might choke me and put me in a cubby hole in his house but so why don't one black dude why don't  you this is what i'm saying it's all one black dude does something it's we all have to go to the  defense i'm tired of defending black criminals i don't want to but but it's ultimately it's it  comes out to be a racial charge with white people they can't just make it not racial don't forget  why should we not hold on just a little serial killer example don't forget uh john mohammed and 
[01:51:00]  and the other guy the uh the other snipers snipers most people are not looking at black people like  potential snipers would it come or not at all or uh still not you know why because that's not really  timothy spencer is another uh across uh is a serial killer black serial killer he raped and  killed white women what about that bad boy i don't know what i'm saying is serial killers are  all weird one man like when you look at someone who's doing such an anomaly a guy that rapes and  commits a murder is connectable to people but a serial killer mass office killers okay i should 
[01:51:30]  be looking at most white dude i should be looking at what you do mentally to uh e-rock i should  always come in here and be like oh boy e-rock could snap today and shoot us all i could i could feel  that way that whole thing by the way is turning around he's becoming one of ours one of us finally  one of ours one of us i'm saying the anger that when he said it's not fair this is what i mean  the detachment the arrogance of white people for him to say to me because i grouped you in and 
[01:52:00]  generalize you it ain't fair but i don't know you out your skull i think you see you're misinterpreting  that is arrogance man i don't think he's being arrogant i think he really is looking it's not  malicious that's what i cut you off before when you said something and you said let me finish i  didn't get to the it's because i i this is a there's a maliciousness that i don't one thing i'm  gonna say not not all white people are maliciously racial but that might not but just because it's a  condition but you can't just say that because he's not being malicious he's still arrogant he might 
[01:52:30]  not be arrogant that he might not be malicious or arrogant you're not separating you're not  breaking it down enough you're saying that whenever a white guy feels something isn't fair according to  race right or or say that's not kind of cool he's being arrogant i wish i could look at white guy's  plight and go the plight of the white man not even a plight though but just a guy going hey man  look at racially the the tipping of the scales racially is not based on black people's relationship 
[01:53:00]  with white people it's based on white people's relationship with white people it's a civil war  between n-word lovers and racists like it's it's the right and the left and and white people are  always discussing how we feel that's what i'm saying we in this country we're like dogs to this country  we don't we don't have our own feelings we don't know how to feel we don't know how to rationalize  we're just crazy uh calm down paranoid crazy black man let us figure out your problems that's what i'm 
[01:53:30]  saying this it's not malicious it's just what white people are arrogant they don't want to hear it no  more that's all it is i'm telling you being from where i'm from what i know is covert non non-aggressive  racism the racism you cannot prove and that's what we're living with now that's why i'm saying all of  this is nonsense to me because i i don't feel anybody change that's all i'm saying where does 
[01:54:00]  the line go between racism you can't prove in covert ratios racism institutionalized racism which i agree  with you it exists i don't it's it's it's like everybody feels bill o'reilly's a racist can you prove  it but where does where does that line and and the line where it's like i i'm black and i'm misreading  this almost like there there is a line where you're black and you're misreading okay give me an  example of you think that black people just misread something about how white people that bullying right  there was a great example of of misreading the it had had i not seen that in every single concession 
[01:54:30]  speech i would have felt like god that bullying this like that was and that comes from education  and i wasn't educated on on that issue i took it as how i felt at the time right and watching mccain  and what i said it had a lot to do with mccain the way he said the way he looked it looked like he  was like don't do why don't do this it look it didn't look phony like this is what he's supposed  to do it looked like a disappointed man in that reaction to the people that represent him because 
[01:55:00]  it just wasn't right i think when he saw them booing he again it was almost like nah don't do the  typical thing now not don't boo like that was the typical thing yes don't do don't do that don't do  what we always do i think he was not now this is a bigger i think he was playing his role in that  whole thing i think he appreciated that people were booing no i don't i because i think because  mccain still believed all the way to the end that he was the better i think he's too gentle when when  you got your supporters going boo i think you're up there going oh that's kind of cool i felt that 
[01:55:30]  guy on his concession i did too i felt that dude oh yeah after felt like when he finally got to  really say what he wanted to say it was it was a great speech i really gotta go to the phones  you guys are killing the talk let's uh go to eric in cleveland eric uh first off i gotta tell you  i'm a black i'm black i didn't vote for obama i felt that obama was bad for the country and i gotta  tell you patricia i'm ashamed of you even being black with me simply due to the fact that i am i'm  listening to you and this garbage that you're spewing out we're we're americans first we're americans 
[01:56:00]  first i understand that people have gone through a lot of hardship and a lot of agony to get  but everybody has chinese irish italian black we've all gone through something our our job is  basically to get there and do what we're supposed to do and i tell you something i'm gonna tell you  something right now white people think you're hilarious white people are like who is this goofy  guy your white wife and your white friends let me tell you something man let me tell you i will  tell you this you said you're ashamed that i'm black i'm you're ashamed of how i feel you're ashamed of 
[01:56:30]  how i feel is what you're saying what you're saying is you're ashamed as a matter of fact you  you insulted me to get your point across and i'm telling you i'm sharing my feelings with you  and you haven't even shared a feeling do you feel like this country's racial do you feel like this  country's racial you're one of these black people let me tell you who you are you're a black person  you're a black person who doesn't eat watermelon in front of white people that's who you are let 
[01:57:00]  me answer that's a good question you are right i don't like watermelons exactly exactly you don't  like nothing that makes you think that you're the black way that white people present you are  hypocritical hypocrites who's hypocrites Obama was a black republican uh-huh would have never got it  that's an absolute lie Colin Powell would have been the president matter of fact when i heard i'm gonna tell  you something Colin Powell Colin Powell sound more presidential supporting Obama than Obama did  idiot he sounded like an idiot because all he could say was that Obama was black and that's why 
[01:57:30]  he supported him not on his ideas not on his concepts and so we decide that this country is far more  important than our whole race aspect i love this country i love this country i want to i want that guy  and patrice asked a good question i want to patrice you asked this guy a good question i didn't hear his  answer about what do you think is racial about the country i would like to hear his response i didn't hear  that what was the question you asked him i it was something about what yeah do you think this  country is racial of course it's racial so that means you but you sound like you've you've made it

[01:58:30]  historically hold on let me answer let me answer they're everybody's being treated like garbage and  i'll tell you how i agree with that man people standing in for food stamps and you know what  those who make it make it those who don't who don't that's the american way you're allowed to feel like  that but i'm gonna tell you you've never had an experience you've never had an experience to have  you realize that that's where you are so wrong wait how is he wrong how is he wrong how am i wrong 
[01:59:00]  i am your i'm your age what happened to you to feel this way i have experienced racism to the  utmost but what have you experienced make a difference what i want to have you and do you  understand how you're sounding you you you're not being honest man you're saying the goofy you're  talking for white people but you have no stand against a black man who has evil intelligence to you  who's experienced what you've experienced i asked you a question what did you experience

[02:05:30]  is half african and half white where they get the slaves from no you're not no you're talking here's  the thing you're doing right now you're being emotional you didn't hear what i said no i heard  exactly that that he's black in this country because of what because of his skin exactly that's  my point i made am i lying you're not lying so what are you upset about that he's not a black man  no no no no see here's the thing here's the thing i can hear from you here's the thing i can hear from 
[02:06:00]  you see see the thing is by what you're saying about how you qualified yourself by saying you're a  real black dude right see i didn't this is our problem we qualify ourselves as real black real  this real that by our experience and and keeping it real in this your voice is not the same as the  other dude and your voice is not the same as mine dude you from east new york i hear it you probably  you probably don't play games and the whole thing you're not a comic and really what you was doing 
[02:06:30]  in an emotional way is you was insulting me you i'm not hollywood i'm not you know i'm not a comic  you dismiss me this is our problem is that we can't be different we can't be different and be  the same what i'm saying is when i say he's not black okay i mean he is not it's not a generational  thing that's deep in him because we've been locked up in this country since 1619 he's let me tell you 
[02:07:00]  africans don't give him to us africa thinks that it's their he's he's theirs he look they said that  they export presidents to this country they disrespect black people they don't look at us like that  i'm telling you patrice when i said a real black man i mean a real n-word okay right i don't know if  i can say it over the radio hold on a second hold on a second when i say that i mean that bro i work 
[02:07:30]  60 hours a week you hear what i'm saying i work 60 hours a week i work on on the weekend doing a  little bouncing job at a little mexican club i got my granddaughter because my son is on the street  right now talking about he's on the grind so he can get 600 prada shoes i'm the same age as you  you understand what i'm saying okay i'm hearing so my perspective is going to be different than  yours just because you got money i don't think there's a i don't got no money dude i don't have 
[02:08:00]  see wait wait i can't wait a second because you just think you think something of me that ain't true  i don't have no money like that you're missing the whole point all right what is the what is your  point i'm coming from emotional what i'm saying is you can get on there and you can talk ha ha funny  jokes did you feel like i was being ha ha funny see this is what's going on i'm gonna tell you  what's going on right now it's it's our problem this is our problem what's going on oh you want  let me see oh i'm sorry but i'm saying how do you throw in you you're insulting me right but then 
[02:08:30]  you want to keep going i can't retort i can't get in there you dismiss me four times already i don't  have the money you think i do let me tell you how easier let me tell you how easy my life would be  if if i smiled and shucked and jive and and and felt and didn't tell people how i feel we're just  nice you understand that's what it is dude i'm telling you all of this all of this keeping it 
[02:09:00]  all this thing where you know i'm a real n-word and all that what the what does that mean this is  what i'm saying dude everybody we're all qualifying what black is when you ask when you ask the other  dude from cleveland what makes what what racism have you experienced and what makes you different  from somebody else like i said okay what is the point so what you're saying is i'm crazy for thinking  that this country's racist i fit the profile so don't ask me about what kind of um so what is your  what is your beef with me i don't think he was the whole i don't think i don't think i was dismissing  you i think he was just like saying i'm not these other things that you've mentioned before you 
[02:09:30]  fair enough but what is your beef with me when when i'm what am i saying that ain't right to you  my beef with you is for you to say that obama is not a black man that he's an african yes  but you gotta understand my point what's his name over here and troy what john  sean sean and therefore this that's where you come in no no sean no listen to me sean let me 
[02:10:00]  let me let me let me try to let me try to say what i meant by that okay what i'm trying to say is and  i could have said it wrong that oh the country is so racial and so racist that anybody black will be  black by their color not their experience not it's just the fact that black people are black  because of our skin and white people are white because of their skin i'm saying that not that he ain't 
[02:10:30]  no real brother i'm saying the dude is first generation african he's not you and i'm not saying that  that's a bad thing i'm saying that he's black because that's how racial the country is is that  they qualify us just by skin that's my point okay all right so i'm sorry for dissing you four times but 
[02:11:00]  let me say one thing to you when if you've seen obama and you don't know he's obama from from you  know a hole in the wall right you just happen to see him on the street you couldn't look at him and  say he's first generation african he's black exactly there you go because of his color exactly  but you don't see white people as irish or you can't exactly ethnicity tell i don't see anybody  i just see him as a dude you know what i'm saying like i said i'm a real n-word but i work with  white people because you have white friends but we're not talking about your friends sean we're talking 
[02:11:30]  about the country we're talking i have white friends there's white people i truly love as people  and they're my friends but and you probably have white guys because you work so hard that dude you  have a beer with them you probably fought with them and you love them but we're talking about the  country man you feel how you feel because of the country right but see what you have to understand is  in order for us to be able and um anthony was asking about a solution and i'm gonna give you the 
[02:12:00]  solution in order for us to be able to move on to the next level where race relations and racism and  racistness whatever buzzwords everybody want to put on it is um it's going to get better we  and i'm saying we now because i'm including you now i'm embracing you okay first i had to spank you  now i'm going to embrace you you think you spanked me are you out your mind what is this a rat battle  song you thought he's spanking jimmy and i spelt it absolutely 
[02:12:30]  now sean you knocked him around a little bit now make him feel better that's right  we all felt it i love when they infight  got lesnar talking a couture right now we have to embrace each other you understand what i'm saying  all right you have to be able to get past the barriers of just because you got a little bit  of chips and i ain't got no yeah exactly you funny haha or whatever yep yep again with the you got 
[02:13:00]  chips he's right he's right do you see where it's going yep this is why we can't couldn't agree more  sean that's right that's what he's got patrice has some chips and and and he is slightly uppity  but i like the fact that sean smacked him around yeah patrice comment patrice comment on what  on what sean said i already commented he missed it he missed the whole thing  92 3k rock 
[02:13:30]  where are you patrice is that your mic today  yeah all right cool opie and anthony uh anthony for the people just tuning in did not make it today  uh his mama and his stepfather sal celebrated 25 years of of uh where are you jimmy there's jimmy 
[02:14:00]  that would be a sin if i wasn't on they had they had their 25th anniversary wedding anniversary thing  that they did yesterday and they called around 7 15 and i thought my pal was calling just to say  hi i'm like oh and wants to just talk about the the football games i'm not stupid i knew something  was up hey can fucking stupid eatman call me back i called him two days in a row and didn't hear i  understand he's a busy guy but it's like how about a minute call back why did what's up trying to talk  to him about something he hasn't gotten back to me it was irritating it was eaten yeah eatman our radio 
[02:14:30]  agent yeah are you using this to get him to call you back because he doesn't listen to the show  every once in a while oh no no no no you know this is way above his head yeah no i wouldn't  expect him this shit's way above his head he doesn't understand no he has no idea what's going  on nah all right uh unfortunately you know a lot of people called in i gotta i just gotta say this  the two companies i've been yelling screaming about this for a while now well over a year maybe two  years they got us to learn how to work together because uh both sides are now insisting that we leave 
[02:15:00]  at a certain time over there and this is where it hurts the show we had the phones lit with some  passion and some anger and some thought and some just a little of everything and we're like oh my  god it'd be so obvious so obvious if these two companies work together we would just sit here  and take advantage of the fact that we have some great phone calls coming in we come in uh to xm  sirius whatever the fuck it's called today and look no phones yet because now we have to rev up the 
[02:15:30]  engine and get it going again they'll call and i just so fucking frustrating it is but this is  where it hurts us they'll never work together the opian anthony show they'll never work together  too bad it does stink because they're hurting the bottom line and i can't believe that i'm sitting  here and i was just i don't know why i just have an erection for no reason at all say else no no just  the rod you know the remember uh the word plethysmograph no plethysmograph was when 
[02:16:00]  talking about chewing your dick just hard for no reason yeah uh if colby bryan had been found guilty  and gone to jail for for the rape uh rape thing in colorado he would as a part of his probation he  would have to get hooked up to a plethysmograph oh yeah and what that does is they show you things  and do it's how they get pedophiles it measures your arousal for different things so if if they  hooked norton up and showed him a picture of whatever and his dick got hard it would be grounds 
[02:16:30]  with the plethysmograph to say this guy is uh pedophile or what have you really that stands up  in court the convicted pedophiles not people not just for your personal taste but for convicted  kid touchers to see if they are rehabilitated because if they have a very high recidivism  rate they will hook your dick up to that and if it's still jumping around but that's why a lot  of them go with chemical castration but you think what you think how are you going to like stop 
[02:17:00]  getting like well norton's dick is hard how would you ever cure a pedophile of that you can't that's  why you get excited by kids i think you're going to always be excited by kids how do they get that  out of your system through i don't know i mean i don't know what their therapeutic process is i  think it should just be a fucking hammer to the temple work orange sure yeah they'll show you a  picture of kids getting fucked with but that sounds using drugs that sounds insane hey uh we can talk  about the obama the black white thing again but i was talking to stunt brain when uh we're trying to  figure out who would uh you know be a good villain because we knew aunt wasn't going to be here today 
[02:17:30]  and and i i said patrice i mean i always say patrice first uh because you just bring uh you know  you bring a lot to the show discord and unhappiness i was having a discussion with  kenny on the way over though i mean even the people that aren't agreeing with patrice and all that  they're not turning the dial so there are people out there that will listen to a show because they  don't agree with sure and i don't even know where it falls what percentage agreed and disagreed  90 10 you really think i know you're kind of going with a joke but i'm i i would i would bet 
[02:18:00]  people's initial reaction is probably to disagree because again it's a white black defensiveness  right but like because you always feel like you have to take up for the white guy the black guy  has to take up for the black guy but you know a lot of what patrice said there's pieces of it i  disagree with but it's hard with him because it's like like as well as i know patrice i'll listen to  him talk about something and i'll agree with like he'll say something and i'll agree with three and a  half fifths of it or four fifths of it and then there's that one piece in the middle i'm like no 
[02:18:30]  that i don't agree with and i don't want to be lumped in with that right um but you know there's  a lot of it that makes a lot of sense if you put down the initial reaction which is i got to defend  white people because i don't have to defend white people because a lot of what is said about the  country is the truth carlin who uh you know i mean look his one of his best bits was fucking  he was talking about american bullshit and how the country was founded i was just one what did he say  one steaming pile of red white and blue all american bullshit and he just destroys the way the 
[02:19:00]  country was founded and what am i gonna do like not love carlin he was right what where's that  bit i gotta listen to that it's off you are all diseased and it's about how it was founded by slave  owners that's one of the hbo specials right but the way you are daniel do we have that bit where  it's called american bullshit is carlin prior one and two for you uh it's prior carlin no i mean i  mean not in that order yes without a doubt it's prior one and then carlin two yes because carlin why is  why that's the same for me and why why is that for you because prior moved me more than carlin did 
[02:19:30]  prior moved me you know in a carlin's genius no was carlin's genius i'm whispering to patrice  no no that's not that because carlin's genius and carlin carlin was a guy who stood there  and pointed at everybody and tells you exactly what's wrong but prior was a guy to me who was hurt  and there was a wounding to him that was like different and he he worded it better than i would  have had nothing to do with richard prior being black uh you know so to speak it was that richard 
[02:20:00]  prior was more if you if you was like trying to figure out what funny is like if funny could actually  be manifested and on earth you go richard prior was funny carlin was verbally i i think is the is the  most verbal he was a master of community he communicated that he doesn't believe in god  and it's amazing like that's what i wish i had that's what i wish i had which is i wish i can 
[02:20:30]  always explain myself exactly what i mean and you can't confuse it he makes you change the way you  think or question the way you think about it which was he makes you think uh but it was comedy but even  like he makes you think and he makes you go like after you're done watching you're like you're like  i didn't want to hear that right like you love prior you like love him yeah and then you love  what carlin does my and but you love richard prior as a i like like just you know i would go carlin 
[02:21:00]  over prior just because i don't know enough of prior stuff to be just to add to the discussion but  what i loved about carlin and i probably saw him close to 10 times was he was he was going after  his own audience and didn't care it's like do you know what confidence that takes and what balls  that takes that you're you're going after let's say religion and you know a bunch of the folks in  your audience are very religious people and i was like that is fucking brilliant that he doesn't care 
[02:21:30]  when he said he said a lot of things one of the things that like this one there's ones that change  your life one of the things he said it changed my life and there's a few things that that prior said  they changed my life too but different different reasons carlin said what the fuck is this shit  about angels i said what like he just said that what is this bullshit about angels and then then he  goes what about goblins how come they don't get no credit like i said what i said he completely said 
[02:22:00]  fuck angels and then the other shit can't say fuck angels like he just said fuck angels it's  we need to believe in the angels and then he said what happened to language in this country  when did my toilet paper become bathroom tissue and he explained that to why words and boy it just  changed my life and and and prior changed my life one of the things he said it changed my life the way  i think is talking about how his father died fucking that woman and and the woman goes i'm so sorry 
[02:22:30]  what i did to your father he goes what he died fucking you bitch it's like it's a hell of a way  to go out yeah if i had to choose to die or get hit by a truck what line would you be in like i'll be in  that long motherfucker like he just rationalized that right without pretension like like come on baby  he was fucking you and he died whatever you want you ain't got no control over that he was prior's thing  was like what he was saying was funny and he was saying it in a really funny way i mean he was just a 
[02:23:00]  purely funny dude like uh not that carlin isn't though because carlin also is a very silly he  understands how to deliver really heavy shit like and be silly okay like he knows when to all of a  sudden like let the air out of the balloon that was carlin's brilliance too he's like he understands  he's basically telling an audience of people who believe in god and he's being serious he's going uh  i tried folks i really tried to believe in god and the way he attacks america he's not being cute 
[02:23:30]  he's fucking telling you this is the real deal and this is how i feel how long is that bad and it's  but what but what do white people american bullshit is not that long what do white people think um  what do white people think when they hear a dude like carlin because it's not many  who who's who just completely trash the the idea of this country you know what i'm saying what do  they think when a white guy is being saying things that a black guy is i guess supposedly i think with  carlin is he's like he's earned so much respect you i think people watch him and they understand do 
[02:24:00]  they think he's liberal well that he is he was more is that is that what people dismiss him as well  he's just i don't think they would never did that was the brilliance uh carlin you couldn't just say  yeah he's a liberal i think because he would attack liberals too and he would attack their  ideology and their phoniness i think when carlin attacked something even if you didn't agree with  it and i shouldn't speak for the people i think you knew that at least he was being very genuine  and you never felt like you had a guy trying to bullshit you or trying to be fucking better than you 
[02:24:30]  you felt like you had a guy who was telling you the truth as he saw it you didn't feel like you had  an agenda no he was just because he would attack liberals right he would give you all this liberal  like left-leaning stuff and then he would attack feminism's phoniness uh he would attack the  phoniness of guilty white liberal language he was a guy who was he always felt like carlin was seeking  the truth and was fucking was was a this is how it is motherfucker i love them man carlin prior  one and two prior who's three because you always hear it's up for debate that's what i'm saying 
[02:25:00]  anybody you want to put in there that's what i'm saying it's always either argue for me it's woody  every comedian would would put prior carlin one two spot not every but most who's three  what name will come up the most number three uh just just in terms of longevity and and again me  and my girl had a conversation about the greatest singers of all time and a lot of that's arbitrary  in your own opinion but we're going okay let's make up the top five comics of all time who you go 
[02:25:30]  everybody has to go okay this is it not your own opinion i would have to say not of my own  opinion you might you might have to put cosby in there as three so it's prior carlin cosby  cosby would be on a lot of people i would put chris rock before i put cosby on my purse way before  chris i like chris a lot man i think you ever hear cosby's stuff that's fucking he was great  amazing he was great he was great got pretty hokey later in his career but god damn his shit was he 
[02:26:00]  was a storyteller he was amazing how about red foxes coming in now red fox was very funny and  that's personal but you wouldn't why not because he did joke jokes whereas whereas personally he  made you laugh he was a funny dude but he was i mean cosby was a fucking i mean he was telling real  life stories he wasn't doing like uh uh exactly like your ass which was funny to hear but it was it  was funny i listened to uh cosby do it i think it was like a 25 minute bit on skiing who has 25 minutes  cosby cosby and it was just my three by the way i'm just saying yeah but a lot of people put 
[02:26:30]  it together why not lenny bruce lenny bruce wasn't funny he would no he was funny but he wasn't funny  like like the top five are funny right lenny was just the guy who kicked the door open the whole  daddy oh shit but that was but back in those days i try to listen to lenny bruce over i just he's not  get into what he is is he's he's essential because if carlin he's important carlin and prior took what  lenny bruce and uh dick gregory attempted which is fighting through language man language at the time 
[02:27:00]  you can get arrested and all that shit for language and then prior and carlin yeah funnied up the  opportunity they took the opportunity that lenny bruce and and dick gregory gave to be funny with it  and i think lenny was funny but not like not number three funny like i look i watch some of  his old stuff and like he's sitting there and he's just kind of talking and he does have that daddy  oh thing which was again but again it was in an era of take my wife please so here was this guy 
[02:27:30]  having this weird which he got all that from this guy joe answers and i was like wasn't it the jazz  culture that whole exactly yeah i think it was working all those clubs you know warming up for jazz  musicians and strippers and he was shitting on everybody oh yeah like lenny was making like i was  watching him do a clean set on tv rodney to me in the top five no to me rodney does not make me laugh  like he used to like the more i listen to rodney i still admire him and i still think he was very  funny but it's more guys to me like prior and carlin you wouldn't put him in the in the not you know 
[02:28:00]  this is the top five of all yeah that's not necessarily me present are we just doing comedians  or political comedians not just comedians in general top five that people would say you're right  rodney might be up there cosby might be in the top five that's what i'm saying in terms of  top five that you can present as a as a worldwide top five easily in my top five and it's unfortunate  he died so young but bill hicks was just fucking amazing i never listened to him holy shit fucking  do yourself a favor listen to relentless i don't want to know what he does not not not 
[02:28:30]  a lot of the shit he talked about in relentless is going on today just brilliant shit kenison i would  put up there kenison kenison in mind yeah i don't think you'd make everybody else's because he died  young but as mine kenison was a funny fuck i was a huge fan of um andy kaufman just because how he  fucked with the audience yeah just see that's what i'm saying the top five you're looking at two dudes  who are socially relevant then after that there's a drop off yeah of well that's why i'm asking it when i  say number three number three in that genre the george carl and richard pryor genre and like you 
[02:29:00]  said there's a massive drop off and it would not chris rock is he's the closest he's the closest in  terms of what he's trying to accomplish with his comedy yeah it's saying something and being funny  at the same time and i like saying something i like where chris comes from a lot of times like a lot  of times you don't see exactly where he's gonna go with it like he's not giving you a one plus two  equals three like a lot of times chris comes from a point of view that i was i'm surprised by  like he had a very i don't remember what his bit on michael vick was but i remember uh watching him 
[02:29:30]  him do like a few minutes on michael vick and i'm like god damn it that's a fucking great point of  view like i didn't even agree with him i don't remember uh but i was like that is a funny you  could appreciate the place i do it was just great and it was a fucking smart funny idea that i remember  just not agreeing with the point but going as a fucking comedian that was brilliant yeah murphy maybe if  he did more stand up but he stopped but eddie murphy is at the top of like i said he's he's the 
[02:30:00]  best probably in terms of even prior dude eddie's that it's a shame he was famous than prior yeah but  it's a shame he was well on his way to be like a richard prior or like a george carlin and then he  went into hollywood two things you know and he you know those two things were just amazing he was  he never had this was amazing but he never had prior or carlin relevance he was funny and he was  amazing mimic yeah he wasn't so it was no social oh yeah well yeah we're talking more social than 
[02:30:30]  anything all recycled prior like everything like even the drunken stepfather uh you know prior did that  or the amityville horror was really the exorcist i mean everything that murphy did  prior had done but it's a drop-off dude prior carlin yeah i think we're in agreement a third is an  argument like i i don't even have a third i mean look i mean we're trying to do this and on instant  feedback you get seinfeld rickles uh smirnoff obviously a joke uh mitch hedbergh you know bill  hicks it does see there's not one name going there's not one name coming in more than any other is what 
[02:31:00]  i'm saying right it's all like i mean hedbergh is like you can like most people wouldn't say he's  in the top five just because it's not time to put him in yeah you would have to wait a few years  uh he was funny though but seinfeld you couldn't top five you you could argue time for could be in  there like did i for what it is i appreciated seinfeld because i was amazed that he could do what  he was doing getting huge laughs without being dirty i was amazed by that brian reagan brian 
[02:31:30]  reagan is as far as just out loud funny he's right there top five ever like no no guys have  ever like belly laughs prior has made me belly laugh like i mean even as a comedian he's made me belly  laugh and there was something it wasn't even always dirty there was something he did and it just it hit  me as funny where he was talking about how his father would fucking sit in the barber shop and then  read the almanac and then wait for people to make a mistake and it just it made me belly laugh at 
[02:32:00]  this picture he painted of this horse's ass of a stepfather just looking to correct people and be  a dickhead but it was just and then wait for people he told you all you needed to know about that guy  yeah when he said my father would read the almanac and then wait for people to make a mistake and  you're like god almighty i know who that you immediately understood this crotchety old fucking  guy see this is the difference between prior and carlin and why i put prior ahead is because carlin  would be able to make it up in his mind and he would verbalize and he would create that thing and let 
[02:32:30]  you and and dissect it prior just felt it and said it yes and it would be nothing pretentious which is  why let me say bill hicks bill hicks didn't i don't think bill hicks became what he should have  been because he he he operated for some reason carlin never operated above the audience you never felt  like he was saying he was looking at you like well he kind of did the whole thing with a wink but you 
[02:33:00]  know it was social something it was he was kind of looking at you like you know what hicks was  disgusted oh yeah oh yeah there was there was real he was with he didn't hide the anger he had  for the system but he was disgusted with like he was disgusted the thing about the audience is you  have to be disgusted at something else and not them or disgusted at them with you have to be with  them on some and what you just said prior had that thing too where he had this ability to talk about 
[02:33:30]  race to white people and you had to laugh and you had to acknowledge that there was truth in it  because you never felt resentful because as a white guy i never felt that prior was trying to  make me feel anything bad other than this is the way it is like he was never trying to make me feel  guilty or bad ever the genius that he was he was never like when he said he goes the the black the  white woman come to me and go that leon spinks is dumb ain't he and he goes what would you think of  me if i agree with you yeah like it wasn't like dun dun dun look at the point i made it was like 
[02:34:00]  hey we got the uh carlin bit about america i want it and it's only like two minutes right it's easy  and it's just the way he's so disgusted it's just the way he says it he's not trying to be  it's real easy george carlin what's this bit called it's my favorite thing my favorite special  is called uh you are all diseased it was done in i think 99 or 2000 three specials ago right  maybe yeah it was done here in new york live at the paramount you uh you have some nice stuff in  your book about george carlin i love i hate your guts and and we learned that you cried when you 
[02:34:30]  found out oh like a baby dude i cried too oh i was walking a dumb beach somewhere when i found out  it's like what the fuck because we had him on only a few months before that happened yes we did  we were hoping for more uh appearances by george all right uh here's the bit because you do know folks  you do know living in this country you know that every time you're exposed to advertising  you realize once again that america's leading industry america's most profitable business is 
[02:35:00]  still the manufacture packaging distribution and marketing of bullshit high quality grade a prime  cut pure american bullshit and the sad part is most people seem indoctrinated to believe that  bullshit only comes from certain places certain sources advertising politics salesmen not true  bullshit is everywhere bullshit is rampant parents are full of shit teachers are full of shit clergymen  are full of shit and law enforcement people are full of shit this entire country 
[02:35:30]  this entire country is completely full of shit and always has been from the declaration of  independence to the constitution to the star spangled banner it's really nothing more than one  big steaming pile of red white and blue all american bullshit because think of how we started  think of that this country was founded by a group of slave owners who told us all men are created  equal oh yeah all men except for indians and niggers and women right always like to use that authentic 
[02:36:00]  american language this was a small group of unelected white male land-holding slave owners who also  suggested their class be the only one allowed to vote now that is what's known as being stunningly  and embarrassingly full of shit and i think i think americans really show their ignorance  when they say they want their politicians to be honest what are these fucking cretins talking about  if honesty were suddenly introduced into american life the whole system would collapse 
[02:36:30]  no one would know what to do honesty would fuck this country up and i think deep down americans  know that that's why they elected and re-elected bill clinton you betcha you betcha  yeah because the american people like their bullshit right out front where they can get a good strong  whiff of it clinton might be full of shit but at least he lets you know it doesn't he dole tried to 
[02:37:00]  hide it didn't he dole kept saying i'm a plain and honest man bullshit people don't believe that  what did clinton say he said hi folks i'm completely full of shit and how do you like that  and the people said you know something at least he's honest  at least he's honest about being completely full of shit  there you go fucking love that there you go but it's a guy who's being who's not trying to soften 
[02:37:30]  the blow he's not trying to and the thing with carlin is the older he got the longer he went in  between punch lines and normally when a comedian does that it is like just saying things but i think  with him he got away with it and i i don't mind it because after 40 years sure of doing nothing but  being funny i i was so interested in the way he saw things how he thought his opinion to me was very  yeah it was extremely how come when jeremiah right if jeremiah right was saying that  or any black comic was saying that that the whole vibe would have been different what the crowd 
[02:38:00]  would have felt different it would have been some other shit but this one was well you all know it's  the same as the source the same as if i miss hadn't said it had been black and so he said black  people wouldn't have been an uproar it's all the source and if jeremiah right had been doing a lot  of fart jokes and people you know come on it's a different vibe when a guy is i'm saying that whole  thing that he was saying truth is what it's just what a black dude who can who can articulate that  would say it but it's always the source you know that anytime you're hearing something we always take 
[02:38:30]  it from where it's coming from but before we react to it there's no absolute truth that we just hear  from any source and agree with it all depends on where it's coming from yeah and as a comic prior could  have got away with that i mean uh bicentennial nigger is the name of an album and the bit and the bit  is at the end of the album and it's it's not it's fucking you know the bit i'm talking about  where he's got the fucking sarcastic american music playing it's fucking he was scary put it at the  end of his cd but no he was fucking it was the best way it was the best way to end a comedy cd ever 
[02:39:00]  it was just so completely you now what motherfuckers hey we got the number we got the number three  comedian it's it's obvious we all uh overlooked this very obvious vince champ oh he was fucking  fantastic vince champ number three number three number three comedian number one boyfriend  oh my god vince champ that is that is a horrific story  that is voss had the funniest joke though because he had been at these colleges all over the country 
[02:39:30]  and voss goes he has a good college agent who's his college agent what it was uh for the newbies  vince champ was a comedian that uh you know he got a lot of people laughing but he also did some  raping on the road in between he traveled through the country raping yeah fuck me man and they found  him from his book like wow he was his book his um itinerary whatever yeah whatever like he's like wow 
[02:40:00]  girl girl got raped uh and they finally started started uh putting it together yeah and on the  internet too because i forget how it came about but he would say yes i don't know after he would  rape a girl i think he would say like pray for me he would do something with prayer right so it was  obviously a demon he was fighting and i think someone talked about that on the internet and someone else  when a guy did that to me it was like one of those connections and then oh i'm a college dude i'm a  college dude he's a black you know we used to say he would rape a bitch and go all right now all right 
[02:40:30]  tell me what you think of this joke jesus hey uh the top 10 comedy central whatever yeah one and two  i'll agree i'm sure they got prior calls eddie murphy 10 roseanne bar nine bill cosby roseanne bar i look  i like roseanne that's but above joan rivers that's a perfect example why we hate these lists where they  have to kind of balance it all out nice joan rivers who was one of the funniest people ever  well roseanne bar beat out johnny carson jerry seinfeld robin williams bob newhart who was 
[02:41:00]  hilarious yeah newhart i'd put in the top 10 you look generous yeah as one of the top 10 stand-ups  don rickles is bill hicks sam kinnison she beat all these people yeah i would agree  stephen wright red fox hope so what was the top 10 it was prior you got uh yeah eddie murphy roseanne  bar nine cosby eight dangerfield seven martin six ah that was the one steve martin number six  steve martin look was a funny guy he was a funny comedian he was doing arenas he was silly i listened 
[02:41:30]  to his shit recently and look i know i'm gonna stand up and i shouldn't be disrespecting his day  look the guy did some very funny shit but when i listen to that material now i like a woman who has  a poopy on her shoes i like that above fucking kinnison or above any of the people  how anybody voted for him in the top 10 makes me fucking sick joan rivers i told you i saw her like 
[02:42:00]  a year and a half ago at the cutting room in front she's working on material and that fucking bitch  came out and was phyllis diller as bro yeah but joan was as brutal a set as i've ever seen a comedian  do i i mean i just i was in awe of what she was doing this is a year and a half ago and i'm like  that is what we do she's in her fucking 70s she stood there for an hour and it was funny shit it was  9 11 it was aids it was fucking brutality from the minute she got out there she didn't give a 
[02:42:30]  fuck man yeah it was like god it was inspiring to watch steve martin 6 yeah chris rock 5 woody allen  4 lenny 3 is a polite thing if he's 3 yeah it's a polite thing carlin prior lenny 3 people think  they're supposed to say lenny bruce because they feel that by not saying lenny bruce they're being  disloyal to something and a pioneer we kind of said that ourselves sort of when you're thinking number  three well yeah he comes to mind because of we're in what he yeah we just believe that well lenny was the 
[02:43:00]  godfather of this type of life when mom is maybe he was doing it too but just not on the mainstream  level but uh lenny is not you ever hear new heart stuff oh he's amazing fucking amazing he had the  number one and number two albums in the country at the same time which was it's mind-boggling the  success he was doing comedy literally for a couple of months when he taped those albums he was it was a  weird gifted thing he had and they were funny i mean you can't even say they weren't funny they  were just a stammering mess yeah i mean he was an original all right um we're gonna take a break 
[02:43:30]  and i gotta piss there's something else that i want to talk to patrice about the blacks  sorry i don't know why i'm saying sorry the blacks with the uh gay marriage issue okay you had some  thoughts on that i do because i think uh what gays are now trying to say that they yeah are on the  same page as black they have been for you're saying that yeah and they are and you got some thoughts  on that yeah i don't think he agrees with that  more with patrice o'neill in just a bit opie and anthony 
[02:44:00]  it's uh opie it's jim norton who's uh doing some gigs where who gives a shit oh no opie hold on  this coming friday i'll be in atlantic city i mean uh vegas yeah at the tbs festival on seven o'clock  show at caesar's palace me and bobby kelly i'm hosting uh wait there you are me bob kelly and  and another comedian how come how come they didn't do the thing on tbs when it was like 
[02:44:30]  seinfeld cook norton that's exactly why because it was seinfeld the generous cook  norton's a big drop off the cliff you know if it was if it was quinn o'neill norton  apollo well you know i don't blame tbs why would you mention me i'm on my my in the on the  brochures i'm in the small font but russell peters is in the small font dice is in the small font i  mean there's some other fucking comedians are in the small font who's in the big font 
[02:45:00]  dane ellen seinfeld cat williams um i don't remember he was in the medium font yeah but i didn't mind being  in the small font because it was like a lot of no like notable comedians we should be in fonted  being fonted is fine yeah you want to be fonted yeah hey uh what were we uh talking about during  the break fonted mother what are we talking about black people and their issues with gay people  well gay people oh no but uh some of the stuff we were saying during the break was pretty funny too  oh the uh oh the thing i was talking to uh john about he goes john gibson loves patrice o'neill and 
[02:45:30]  i'm on there messing around with him and uh i i said john i know what white people want out of  this they want racism to be over out of this election i said it's not going to happen it's  not going to happen he goes well you owe us something what are we going to get i go white  people if you're going to say okay here's what you can keep you can you can keep out of space  and you can keep the ocean that's my deal with white people you can't i'm not going to stop saying 
[02:46:00]  racism exists but i will stop saying i will let you continue to go in out of space and do things  and i will let you go in the bottom of the ocean because black or climb mountains so anything that  black people have no interest in doing ever we can have that you can have that that's nice here patrice  yes hey that's my deal with you now the other the other big issue and we do have uh we we have this  texas pastor we'll try to get into it but he he's preaching seven days of sex it's a great little 
[02:46:30]  story we're going to get to that but we're going to start with the gay black thing yeah black for  some reason just to bring everyone you know on board proper proposition eight yeah was voted uh down  so uh gays can't you know be married in california okay do you think gays should be married yes  personally yeah i do too jimmy yes of course and i think that on a level here's the level i was thinking  i don't give a shit totally like that's the level not on a civil rights manner or this and that it's 
[02:47:00]  who i don't give because marriage as an institution has used to be something like godly in the eyes of  god we are in union with each other forever now it's just health insurance and who gets shit at the  end of the day and can i visit you in the hospital and all kind of goofy shit i what what what do i 
[02:47:30]  care i don't give a fuck gay my thing is i'd always felt this and is that your sexual preference and  here's my thing i want i want somebody to give me a logical reason why your sexual preference i should  be hearing about it why who you want to be with qualifies you to go through something and the the  part of it that bugs me is i'm born this way shut the fuck up because why is that a preference 
[02:48:00]  and choking your bitch while she's coming is a fetish you wait wait you you don't you're looking at  like just the terminology used around i just don't want to sexual preference sexual preference just the  way they phrase it but if gay people are born gay let's just say for the sake of argument they are  born gay yeah um which i certainly believe that the majority of them are right because why would  you go through anything that you didn't have to go i just think it's i think it's for nature puts it  into play i think i think i think it's part of nature someone explain it to me they said you think 
[02:48:30]  i would choose this you know and you've seen too many little gay kids that are like this when they're  like really small like before they are able to make a decision there was there was someone that was  working in this business pretty close to us that was gay steve steve well sure and uh you know i'm  i'm i'm like a sheltered white kid from long island i was on i only started learning about the the gay  thing when we were at uh new and he and this person's like you think i would choose to be like this hell  no it's so much easier to to you know to be with a woman then but so fucking what you know you think 
[02:49:00]  you're born a certain way and you decide that you can't take your own hiding of your your thing that  you feel society's against so you come out in this in this manner of defiance to say fuck that i'm not  gonna hide who i am no more but i still am not going with okay i'm born this way it's still sexuality 
[02:49:30]  well that's just their way of trying to explain it to people what it look if it's i don't i think  you're getting like jimmy said i think you're getting caught up in you can't say that they're  not born that way though yeah i'm not saying they're not born that way you don't think people  are born that way i'm born this way i'm with jimmy i think most people are born to to be gay i think  you're born i to a certain degree certain things are learned i'm not saying that certain people don't  learn to be gay i don't know if i don't know ready here's my thing now guys is a different  story and i'm not i'm not trying to make a bit out of it but for for the most part once you get 
[02:50:00]  fucked as a man if somebody goes hey you ever have sex with a guy matter of fact prior did come out  with that yes but no one ever goes okay just like you and your thing no one goes well no one's gay  not gay but but guys usually guys usually once they step over the bounds of of of of fucking a guy  sorry i couldn't help you there jimmy they're gay forever women can play this is what i'm saying  about what you play with if you and h would be gay on wednesday and straight on thursday and and and 
[02:50:30]  if a woman goes i'm gay see gay to a guy for a woman is a bull dyke like who just said fuck it  yeah hi how are you sis but to what if a woman eats another woman's pussy we don't give a fucking  on that level and she can switch up tomorrow that i'm not saying that you're not born but you're born  like that you're born bisexual you're born wanting to fucking eat pussy i think that what are you talking 
[02:51:00]  about their argument is this they just don't want to have to fucking duck they want to be able to get  married or get divorced or just do what they want and be left alone and i think that's where the  defiance comes in it's like uh because like if you want to go out and get married or you want  partner benefits the body you want the same shit that everyone else is getting legally that's it you  don't want to have to go to church and you don't want to hear this this fucking this sickening 
[02:51:30]  organization tell you that what you are is a sin i agree well what you are is dirty and you're not  going to get into heaven and that's just the the fucking the sickening history of the church  disagree with that i don't that's what they want i agree with you a hundred percent i think that's  what they want that please i don't i don't in the eyes of i know that the institution of marriage  isn't that to get to the fact that black people didn't uh vote for that or that they're 70 percent  or some 80 percent yeah black people are horrified of god and they're horrified of god it's religious 
[02:52:00]  on on and and also latinos they're religious yes to the fact that a lot of religious black people  are horrified to change the jesus that looks like you know tom petty he they're scared  young tom petty to question white jesus that's how man black people do not play around with god  it's a religious and one thing that black crowds don't go for is really you can talk about god 
[02:52:30]  but like white crowds will let you get rid of pedophile stuff and uh and religious stuff a lot  more than black crowds black crowds are conservative in the way they think religiously yeah and and and  ultimately and let me make this sure i say this right that on on when you get religious strong  religious thinking people like i believe in god but religion i question strong religious people  thinking people who just going to go with what they go with and be conservative it gay is not 
[02:53:00]  acceptable by god so they'll be going against the rules of the bible by supporting that and that's  all it is too religious thing yeah but when you're a person who can think most people go who gives up  like i get mad at gays for even thinking like get that it's the same thing we we as a white person  this is a great point to to go with the race part as a white person you go i don't give a fuck about 
[02:53:30]  that as as a straight dude i'm like what i don't first of all get over yourself i don't give a fuck  what you do i'm not looking at you like anything get i live in new york there you go now you understand  how exactly and but a gay guy has feelings right he wants you to just won't understand the gay guy wants  you to care more but the fact is i don't give a shit you know i mean you know you ask me yeah i  think you know gay marriage should be legal but i'm not gonna run out there and start marching and i 
[02:54:00]  you know i have all the things to worry about that's the point we've been making all morning so i do  understand but if a gay guy has some points about his feelings that make sense because like i said to  me it's it's a sexual thing it's nothing but sexuality it's not look i have a nigga parade  every day i walk down the street motherfucker there's no special day i can i always am black  but a gay guy or or lesbian or gay guy or gay guy or lesbian they it there's a lot of choice to why 
[02:54:30]  do i need to know now oh wait a minute if the platform if the platform is here's the thing  educate me what is it that happens that gay people don't get and the rights that they don't have other  than ridicule because i should be able to ridicule you i should be able to say i don't like you sissy  that why i'm not trying to kill you but what is it that you cannot do that heterosexuals can do 
[02:55:00]  i think it's the majority of it uh is like you said you said something like there's a perception  like well people don't always know they're gay but people always know you're black like that  but in a way it's like i don't think gay people want their rights hold on i don't think they want  their their lives in any way hinged upon the hope that people don't know they're gay i don't i think 
[02:55:30]  that they're at a point where they're tired of it and sick and tired of having to not be affectionate  with who you want to be affectionate with other than you tongue kissing your girl in public right  why the fuck do i know what you do sexually other than public affection like what is it that i need to  know about you okay the fact that that you like me a lot of times open i guess guys that are open  about being gay that have a gay boyfriend it's harder for them probably to get hired as teachers  it's probably harder for them to work in any capacity as kids about adopting children about 
[02:56:00]  getting married about partner benefits like there's a whole bunch of shit that they have a whole  different set of rules for and it's not just hey i don't want people to go when they see me because  that's a human reaction i think that they want to be able as a couple who makes 180 000 a year  between them want to be able to go in and hey i'm a school teacher my fucking husband's a  construction worker we want to go and adopt the fucking kid and we're going to be better parents  all right so okay here it is and this is what comes back to my issue with the black thing do you want 
[02:56:30]  just the legislation rights meaning do you want this country to really feel differently about  homosexuality or you just want to be able to be hired no matter what and you'll take that but  people are still going in their gut but they don't like you and it's really they don't want you around  but you have to legislate it first now you can't legislate morality you can't legislate stuff like  that uh but you have it once it's on the books and once it's happening well then people begin to live 
[02:57:00]  with you and be begun to work with you and go oh well everything is cool like like this stupid  prejudice i had or this stupid fear i had is unfounded but the only way people do that because  most people when exposed to you and and you're exposed to them kind of go oh all right it's not  what i was told and again what we're talking right now we're talking to three cities there's only three  cities in america new york la and chicago chicago this is a city issue because if you're white black 
[02:57:30]  whatever and you live in new york la or chicago you have to deal with everybody yes we're talking  people who again you don't understand man you travel a lot you must know you go holy shit i live in new  york and you go this place is like living on another planet compared to michigan i also in this  conversation i also think the gays are the target a lot of times of violence uh and again in new york 
[02:58:00]  no i don't know i'm talking about the whole country and again you can't legislate that where  people aren't going to go ugh or want to kill you for being gay you can't but the more the law is on  your side and the more the law and the country as a whole sees you as legitimate and what you're  doing is fine and and okay the the less you have to walk around afraid there's no heterosexual  there is no people who are fiercely heterosexual meaning with a need to be like all right hey let 
[02:58:30]  me i want to be able to hold my girlfriend's hand if i want to like there's some people that look at  you and go what the fuck like for what are you doing that for we don't have to hide it the thing  is we're coming like you said they don't have to hide no no but you like you know how you said you're  saying white people come a place of white entitlement this is a case of straight entitlement  you get but i'm saying you get so used to not having to be a certain way you're like  well why can't you just do that when the fact is why isn't other sexual sexual things 
[02:59:00]  involved in that why is it for them it's not just sexual for us it's sexual because like hey one  guy's fucking another guy but for them it's falling in love it's being with a partner it's  like all the other things you do i love in a relationship me and you both so if i love  prostitutes why can't i affectionately this is what i'm saying see it again it's going to be  taken wrong yeah my thing i'm coming from a point of view like but do you want to visit a prostitute  when she's in the hospital i might yeah you know some some of my sick babies in brazil 
[02:59:30]  do you want to adopt a kid with the prostitute but again it's it's it's more than a sexual thing  it's it's i guess it's a lifestyle there's a lot more going on there just like lifestyle opie  sadomasochism uh uh uh uh uh uh bondage that's a that's a sexual lifestyle but what i'm saying is  i understand the love thing and this but see that's not the platform again i don't give a fuck  it's just like abortion with me the thing about abortion my thing with it is look i just get i have 
[03:00:00]  issue with women saying it's my body i just have issue with it it's not your body bitch your kneecap  your brain your earlobe is your body but once you fuck a guy and some magic happens and then  something is growing inside you against your fucking i nature nature's not your body you just  happen to be chosen to be the baby's apartment building yeah anything could be that's not that 
[03:00:30]  doesn't make you special and it doesn't make it your fucking body but you're not pro-choice  kill it if you feel like it are you pro-choice but i'm at the same time yeah i agree  i think it comes down to love though like when you're doing the fetish stuff you're not  you're not there's no love there really all gay fucking is love i know no no as far as the other  stuff they want if i lovingly put a red ball in my girl's mouth and put plastic bag over her  fucking head but i really care about no but he's saying that it's not just about that stuff it's  like the bottom line it's not just about the the sexual act opie i know that but that's my thing 
[03:01:00]  what is it about please tell me i don't know what you're fighting about i don't want to i can't  agree with the fact that you want to fight to love the same sex all the stuff i just said  ridicule no no but all the stuff i just said pretty good point about all the stuff i just said there's  marriage which goes in with benefits what do they really want inheritance hold on all that stuff  and and the ability to adopt children and the ability to work where you want to work without  without having to hide who you're with without having to pretend you're something you're not the fact that 
[03:01:30]  the the fact that here's how you know there's a problem the fact that they wanted to make a  constitutional amendment to make their marriage illegal the fact that that is something i don't  agree with that but but the fact that that is such the fact that the country is looking at it like we  have to change the constitution so these people cannot enjoy the same marriage that we enjoy  shows you that it's a bigger issue than just what can i hold hands in the restaurant here's the issue 
[03:02:00]  with black people and again you know speaking for everybody is you know whatever black people  are not as long as the platform um is compared to civil rights you'll never ever get the cooperation  from black people even though it's a legitimate comparison in the sense of you're shaking your head  no but the fact is there are people in power who are treating people who don't have that power  wrongly it's an oppression it's an ugliness it's a fucking ignorance and it's people who are being 
[03:02:30]  hurt by other people who have no fucking business hurting them what you just said right what i say  what i say based on feeling it just ain't gonna happen if if gays don't have uh a real compelling  argument to make black people feel their pain that feel that the same way that we feel is the same  way they feel and it's civil rights and a lot of people's civil rights can be violated for a lot 
[03:03:00]  of different reasons like i am for that on that level what you said but the platform of the fact  is to me i can't see past that it's your sexual preference that's because black people are as  shitty and awful as white people right in this country the hand has been dealt so much one way  but when you look in in sudan there's slavery african no no no no no i know what i'm gonna say 
[03:03:30]  to agree with you is that ultimately this is what we this is my thing about africa i never want to go  back to africa i don't relate to it i don't look at it and go kings and queens we're from motherfuckers  that'll chop a motherfucking hand off or a diamond genocide killing each other they do that shit in  africa i'm not fuck i don't i'm not an africa guy so everyone i'm saying is this is that everyone  went in a position to fucking say hey fuck you to the next guy does it it's a reality but i'm not 
[03:04:00]  saying fuck you but in a way if we're allowing people to be treated badly it sometimes there's  a fuck you by lack of empathy sometimes it's like you say how do you get black people to empathize the  fact that a group who has been shit on doesn't look at another group who's been shit on and go  even though we don't agree with you now hold on you're being shit on here's and gays have been so  as a group pro-civil rights and so and so completely involved with with black people like never once 
[03:04:30]  turned their back on blacks and here's the thing agree with you a hundred percent my thing is  okay what do you want as a black man what do i want do i want things like the black president  to to be the the basis for how far i've come because of moments moments because of of uh what am i 
[03:05:00]  looking what's what i'm looking because of okay the president or the first black guy in baseball or  hey uh affirmative action you you got you got to give me fair and equal treatment do i want it  in that manner or do i want it in in my in somebody's heart so what i'm saying is for the  manner that i say you can get married really is the dismissive manner that this country does black  people meaning i'm going i don't give a fuck right get married but okay do i do i want white people to 
[03:05:30]  go man this was wrong yes sure so what gay people probably want to go you know you at you you should  be able to love who you want which i am with but i'm saying for me to be with you on a civil rights  thing you have to be more compelling than i want to love i want to put it this way if it's practical  like hey i just want to have the same opportunities as this the fuck yeah but if you're gonna just like  i can't make a white guy feel that he's not superior to me because he's white i can't i can't 
[03:06:00]  make him but the more gay people to think the same thing with races you have to legislate certain things  and once the country once you don't feel the whole country is saying as a government you're wrong for  being gay and in a way it feels like they are and the church is saying it when those organizations  are not saying it and all of a sudden you know you go again it's generational you go 150 years from now  and fucking gays have been adopted and living and we all because we all have gay people in our  president maybe well look we've already had a gay governor and i'm sure we've had more than that 
[03:06:30]  bonnie frank and gay and gay openly gay uh uh priests and it what i'm saying is as time goes on and  people get used to it and live with each other and have life experiences with each other that will  ultimately be the internal change yes but it happens over a long period of time in our lifetime  no it's a sign of us being primitive it's like tiger woods when he first won his thing it's like  okay it's like here's my thing here's what you think he's still dealing with racism yeah in that 
[03:07:00]  sport yeah because in what way it's not outward i don't think um let me let me kind of go with some  of the things you said today while tiger woods black guy winning it all like what the fuck is this  and then a bunch of years go by i know the fuzzy zeal thing but a bunch of years go by now it's like  i don't see people really feeling the same way for tiger in general they'll always be accepted  because they speak because i think it's just like the whole thing with the celtics and all black guys  i think ultimately you want to win and i think if uh obama does a spectacular job but no one really 
[03:07:30]  wants tiger to win for any reason that um i think like you want your sports team to win because you  live in that city but tiger woods why would i want to win i think the dominant i love seeing him  i love seeing someone that great in their sport and i that's why i root for tiger but there is  something about a black guy dominating a white sport in the sense that you understand the historical  relevance of it even though we don't always speak it there is a historical relevance for a sport that 
[03:08:00]  has historically been one way and then this guy comes along but and he's not average he he's he might  be the best that ever played at least professionally or right there is something very compelling about  putting those things together i just don't i'm a huge golf fan i do not watch ty i don't i swear  to you patrice because you'll probably question me on this i don't see color when i see tiger woods  anymore i believe i love seeing someone that is that much better than everyone else and i like 
[03:08:30]  muhammad ali was that much better than everyone else you wanted to see him be everybody i believe  you dude i do i absolutely and then my fingers am i the exception my no no i believe this is the  thing it's it's at first sure i was like wow why are these black fucking dominating golf this is  crazy you feel powerless but that's you used to it you feel powerless this is what i mean in terms of  relating to the to the gay issue as a black person i feel like it's almost like i said the hypothetical  question is it's powerless it's like you go here's how i'm free or here's how tiger woods plays golf 
[03:09:00]  niggas can't play golf okay niggas can it it's it's by the stroke of a pen niggas are free niggas ain't  it's like it it doesn't feel like there's ever really it's it's still that this country has the  power to the idea that someone has to fight and die to get rights from people it it seems it's  something unfucked up about it like that gaze this shouldn't even be an argument this should be like 
[03:09:30]  i don't agree with guys fucking guys but i do love to see lesbians fucking lesbians and then  but about another person going eh all right gays get married it it's something wrong about that that's  what i'm saying is it's like just because the pen changes it you're forced as a person that wants  to feel a certain way about another people you're forced to be fake agreeable to it and i don't know 
[03:10:00]  fake agreeable adds up to yes to real yes it i think in in not all cases and again not you know  in a one lifetime thing but fake agreeable at worst case scenario stops people from fucking with you  at worst case scenario all right they hate me but i can live my life and if they do something to  interfere with my life because of who i am i have a fucking recourse a legal recourse which i'm promised  anyway in the fucking bill of rights um if as time goes on most human experience is that the more 
[03:10:30]  you interact with people and as people get on the way they feel changes because their own personal  experience but first and foremost you have to have someone put a stop to go all right stop this has to  happen this way you can get married you can do what you want and then all of a sudden your kids  grow up with some fucking kids that are gay parents and you go well he was a nice boy i liked him a lot  and my son played very well together i liked those parents my kid would go over there and stay over  and they were really wonderful people and they took him camping all these things that you're afraid of 
[03:11:00]  when you live through them and you see oh yeah that was baseless as time goes on and again it's  unfortunate for us it's a long fucking process but as that happens you look at it and go wow i was  afraid of nothing because interracial relationships there's still plenty of people that frown on them  well look at where that was 50 years ago and look at how people look at that now it's it's again i  love the point norton's making today i love it i'm i'm not with norton but here's here's the thing that 
[03:11:30]  that ultimately and it goes with the gay thing and the black thing is how you feel yeah 16 19 i believe  16 19 i'm very close is when slavery officially started so you go you go 17 19 18 19 200 years  19 19 19 you go 400 years man and up until then you could be as fucked up as you want to be as a white  person to a black person up until yesterday so for 500 years you're going to tell me 389 389 years 
[03:12:00]  400 years that that the the feelings in this country have changed since jim crow which was in 1950 1960  are you it just the feeling the feelings in this country were changing before then absolutely they  were changing before then um don't forget after a certain point they wanted to keep slaves slaves for 
[03:12:30]  economic reasons but then the feeling a lot of the country was split like there was a lot of people  feeling this is horrible and this is in a time where it was acceptable yeah and it was changing  white abolitionists man white people uh my but look at the civil rights movement the the biggest the  turning point to that movement where the fbi got involved on a pr level is when that white woman  from detroit who was driving i forgot her name she was driving black people back and forth from alabama  to uh i think oh shit but she was driving black people to vote right they shot her when that white 
[03:13:00]  woman died then it then lyndon b johnson kind of was like straighten these motherfuckers out man  but you can't just be shooting white women helping black people out so ultimately it took her to  have something bad happen for that thing to change but ultimately i think in this country and not for you  and not for opi i'm talking about as this country and you got the country that it it never has looked at 
[03:13:30]  it as wrong it's always been i better not do that because of what what it it can cost me i think the  percentage of people that look at like you're saying is much smaller than you think i i think  the fact that most people feel assert you're not giving people credit said that on the radio by the  way anthony said that it was a black guy that called in and anthony goes he goes look i got in  trouble for saying something at work he goes look man anthony goes if a white guy says something at work 
[03:14:00]  we're gonna get fired that's why we don't say things like that anthony is is to me he's speaking  because the guy is a smart fucking guy and he's speaking to his gut and he's speaking to how  have you ever read something called the um but most willy lynch papers hold on hold on you can't just  yeah freedom of language at work is different and most people probably think that way yeah it's not  just with that it's learning these huge moral lessons that you you think patrie that's the problem 
[03:14:30]  and i think and but it's not a white thing i think it's it's human beings don't learn these huge  moral things they just like i'm saying they stop doing things because oh wow this is hurting me  but they're not thinking okay now i understand exactly it's not a malicious thing they don't  think right or wrong a lot it's not a malicious thing that's why i keep i keep prefacing this shit  yeah it's not just an insidious guy that it's not a the white people are sitting there  i'm not saying that it's a condition that just the fact that i refer to you as white 
[03:15:00]  and you refer to me as black is what this country is look asians if it wasn't that it would be big  and small it's always the most obvious thing but you know but you know asians in this country  asians to other asians latinos to other with we are the only group who bond together by our color  and and and that's why i brought up the thing about obama and he's african is that we bond with  him for his color but latinos it do you realize the war with with latinos oh yeah puerto ricans 
[03:15:30]  are hated by mexicans cubans they don't consider themselves fucking us asians don't consider  themselves us but the other thing with the asians and the puerto ricans is they have a difference in  language i know black africans did i know the irish did but white people and black people for a very  very long time in this country have shared language whereas when you look at asians there is that one  weird thing that separates most spanish people in their house speak one language and outside or speak 
[03:16:00]  both that does there is a cultural connection that they have which most other mexicans no no spanish  to spanish asian to asian they don't like each other right no i know japanese and chinese are two  different languages yes completely and they hate each other yeah but this country wants to desperately  look at them all asian all asian well they are having it but they are all asian in the sense that  anyone with a certain dark skin tone is black and anyone with a certain skin tone is white you do lump 
[03:16:30]  people in by appearance all like it's like when you say someone's latin yeah from latin america that  covers a lot of spanish people some of who hate each other but most spanish people a dominican  puerto rican or cuban and they don't join into this they don't join in together in this country  for and uh uh to have uh some type of silent war black people and white people are only people  in this country who band together who actually have nothing to do with the history of why we hate  each other do you feel what i'm saying like my father's from barbados i really don't have anything 
[03:17:00]  to do with slavery but i'm black it's like it's an automatic inherited kind of fucked up feeling  and i didn't make it up you should be flattered we don't pay attention to any of the groups like  we do the blacks oh yeah we are the number one oppressed nigga you should be flattered i don't  want nobody trying to take our oppression from is there isn't there racism within the black community  depending on what color it's not color color no light skin no some are looked down upon because 
[03:17:30]  they are light skin yeah but that i know that it was happening in south africa willie lynch papers  but is that not happening or what not not as much as it was but it is like that fuck that it's the it's  like the school days thing with spike lee you know the wannabes and the jigaboos that old black bitch  oh look at that she got good hair and it's it's all from fucking slavery opie right it's big it's it's a  fucking big deal that we don't even know what the big deal but again if it wasn't slavery 
[03:18:00]  maybe it is in this case but over in africa it's tribal or over somewhere else it's something there's  always a reason why people are going to fucking infight like again when you look at you know i don't  know enough about african tribes but i know and otherwise that when one tribe would conquer another  they would be they would enslave the tribe and i know it wasn't the total degradation that they  suffered at the hands of europeans the total removal of everything but it was still you know we're  murdering you and enslaving it wasn't polite they probably removed a lot of their yeah being 
[03:18:30]  of course but i'm saying it wasn't as as i probably not as dehumanizing as what happened here it's it's  here's the thing it's like okay you can do two things one you can be completely focused see that's  the thing i you know i love about the white experience is that you can be completely focused  on you meaning you don't have to defend anything white if it's wrong it's wrong it's right you know  it's just like hey this is my issue you don't have to take up if a white guy does some dumb shit 
[03:19:00]  um all you have to do is go look at that dumb motherfucker you don't have to associate with  him my thing is i would love to get to a point um where okay i got two choices one i completely  just focus on me and do what i can to do the best for me and not think about blackness at all  just not think about it just take it all as hey officer you know you're doing your job if i could  think like that life would be easier in my gut but ultimately if you think for a minute about the 
[03:19:30]  plight of a people you know what i mean and how people are presented to the world um you can't you  can't help but be fucking upset it's just like that's what i'm saying it's like look at the stereotype  and i always bring jews back because they have the only plight that is close you know i mean like gays  it wasn't like all gay slaves at some point so it's like jews are their stereotype is they own  the banks the media the they rule the world they're bastards running the puppet strings 
[03:20:00]  for a people to be had upgraded themselves pull themselves up to the level of that's their  stereotype i want i just want to have a goddamn decent stereotype as a nigga i want to have a  third type like big dick you know you got it thanks an intellectual one i think thanks for my  big dick that i don't have if that was one you know what i'm saying but but but i watch a lot of  porn and there's some giant white dicks floating around this planet damn right there are giant 
[03:20:30]  god damn right so it's ultimately it's an opportunity for me because there are some unspectacular  boring mediocre black people out there yes i'm sitting next to one come on folks  you got some good positive stereotypes though name 30 we run it's all slavery big it's all it's all  cracker feel it's all physical stuff yeah run fast jump high what's wrong with that and and again 
[03:21:00]  here's another thing that fucks up is the gender line because america don't give a fuck about black  black women black women don't scare america y'all love sassy black flip mouth black women  i don't know oh lord jesus watch out give me a break i should be chief chief you a crazy  motherfucker chief hey florence get your big head out of here they love they love you never see  a fucking that's why obama's so wonderful to people is that it it's a black man in that position 
[03:21:30]  because america never fucks with the eye because you're afraid that we gonna get some type of  goddamn negro revenge i'm more afraid of michelle obama than barack why i don't know you love  michelle obama she crazy her and no no michelle obama is not like she crazy michelle obama seems  very radical and i know barack's much more radical than he let's not sure uh they said yeah look at his  wife which is fine but they sat in church with fucking jeremiah right for for 20 years they knew 
[03:22:00]  it and i'm actually fine with it any i can't take them to task for that any more than i can take bush  or anybody else for sitting there believing that christ pushed a big rock out of the way it's like  if you're gonna call people if you want to call people's religious believe in dinosaurs anybody that  doesn't believe in dinosaurs is unreasonable i don't want to talk to you you're a blithering  idiot if you don't believe in dinosaurs you fucking asshole you're a fool that's always a  tough conversation to have with somebody hey you don't believe in dinosaurs what are you a dick let's 
[03:22:30]  at least agree there were dinosaurs can we agree on anything we're not gonna agree there's  there's no fucking dinosaurs you think holy shit there's a plot that's what i'm saying about jeremiah  right he goes you know aids was invented by or hiv was invented by the government and and and people  go oh god this is crazy and i'm like well possibly but do i believe it no but possibly but but you're 
[03:23:00]  gonna say that the government couldn't invent uh they they invented a a a paranoia or a or a plot to make  you convinced that hiv doesn't exist but they also are up to trying to make me believe there's dinosaurs  like what is the plot to why i should believe in dinosaurs who the fuck why would you invent  that dinosaurs live they don't disagree with dinosaurs living they disagree with carbon dating 
[03:23:30]  they understand they think that the dinosaurs are real okay they just think the carbon dating was wrong  because they're blithering fucking idiots and then what's the carbon dating carbon dating says  how old 60 million years ago and which destroys the the literal biblical idiocy they're living with  so wait so the dinosaurs were here it was six thousand years with people too yeah they think  the dinosaurs and people coexisted they acknowledge dinosaurs existed how long ago jimmy like six  well the jurassic area was 60 million i mean no i know that but what they're saying is just  oh six thousand years yes a few thousand years ago dinosaurs and humans walking dinosaurs and 
[03:24:00]  pontius pilot and and the whole yes and christ was running one dinosaurs living millions of years ago  is insane yes that's what they think because they don't acknowledge evolution  and that's the argument that i just can't have unreasonable i don't even feel like going down  that road like if we go back to the gay thing i don't want gay people to think i'm fucking  i just go please give me a convincing argument to make me go you know what that's very very fair 
[03:24:30]  and that's how you know it's been a long morning when patrice o'neal says i'm a reasonable guy  who are you trying to kid i'm not a reasonable i'm exhausted yeah it really is it's been a four  hour temper tantrum yeah what jesus you cocksucking motherfuckers anything else you want to get off  your chest while we're here is your punching bags this five hours is getting exhausted anthony  anthony but he's different anthony anthony re-filmed birth of a nation six times oh i love anthony but 
[03:25:00]  i am watching my friend unravel he's coming apart at the seams he's coming apart every day at the  seams you motherfuckers patrice is what you're very unreasonable but anthony's coming apart anthony's  almost beyond help you're still within the realm of help anthony is unhelpable anthony will only be  helped and that's why people want turn the other cheek no no that's making a good point about i mean 
[03:25:30]  jimmy's making a good point about it no i'm talking about anthony i'm saying that you're still salvageable  as a person anthony i don't want to be salvageable as long as anthony's around anthony is going to be  anthony's going to come out of it someday in a psychiatric hospital mumbling something racist and and even  even people who are like his family are going to go you're taking it too far and this is beyond  taxes it's bullshit do you understand we're doing a radio show with the next i'm mad as hell and i'm  not going to take it anymore yeah it's fucking great is this for us absolutely he's fucking  this is network man he really is going to live in that work he's excited except he's not going to 
[03:26:00]  inspire anybody to do anything right yes he is no he's not he's not a mean dude he's going to inspire  some psychopath garbage man to all right calm down now anthony's only expressing anger and stuff  but anthony's not a mean dude and there's nothing mean about what anthony's saying no i'm not  saying he's going to inspire he expresses uh what a lot of people was thinking i have to yeah i have  to piss badly why when i'm saying it i'm crazy because you're black i don't think you're crazy  he's a black thing well thank you for being honest at least i get that from you all right we're 
[03:26:30]  gonna take a break i don't know oh the sex thing we could do that got a pastor preaching seven  days of sex what are the people on the phones people that hold on for hours well uh we got  john connecticut at least our hatred for gays can bring races together we got rich in connecticut  how can anyone believe people and dinosaurs existed together uh pad and belmore religious  freaks also say god put dinosaur bones here to test our faith oh my god does somebody actually 
[03:27:00]  say that and nod religious freaks how dumb are people and you wonder why we have problems in  this country those motherfuckers are stupid but it's like how do you expect to work i would never  argue with a religious freak i can't be bothered i could argue with you all day patrice because  they're based in a fake can't be bothered there's no prejudice there's not many prejudices that are as  unshakable as a religious person's faith because when you when you when you argue religion with 
[03:27:30]  somebody and you can hear how they're so rooted in it it's because they were raised from day one  thinking that and to fucking shake them from that is this admission that everything has been just  nonsense all those hours i wasted yeah let's go to chris in florida am i that big of an idiot chris  in florida writes gays just want equal protection of the law this guy said that in arizona he says he's  gay we're up against church-funded psychos who want to block our rights his marriage is a church 
[03:28:00]  issue keep it out of government no it's not it's not really the courts the courts are not done by  the church right and the courts the church isn't doing divorces okay the church marriage is not a  total church thing of course it's not and if black people bond so much why is there so much black on  black crime we don't bond so much that's that's that's what i'm saying it's the statement that he  hasn't been listening to anything and a lot of people would say that that was a certain uh a  self-hatred in the black community which was put there yeah because of all the years of mistreatment 
[03:28:30]  that now people just start attacking each other that's what some people would say i would not  be one of those people are we uh actually would kind of any of these guys you want to talk to  or just clear the lines i wouldn't mind talking to one of the gay guys we don't get a lot of gay  calls i do want to be a reason i want to hear a reasonable all right what's your name  that's reasonable man all right back arizona this is dan what's up hey dan what do you got today  the cocksucker i just want yes the cocksucker i just wanted to say um you know there was uh there  was some recent propositions to california arizona and there was there was at least five to one 
[03:29:00]  funding from mormon organizations the church organizations to put propaganda on the tv  on everywhere just to just to get their their churchy little agenda passed  which was uh which is discriminatory discriminatory and also it's not illegal to fire somebody if  they're gay if they're gay you can fire them and there's no legal recourse so what is it but okay 
[03:29:30]  my my thing is and this is where i sound like a fucking asshole is look i don't i agree what what do  you do you want all these things to change just by the stroke of a pen and okay you can't get fired  because you're gay or would you love to have just a feeling that everybody really did they just don't  care you can do what you want that you know hey how are you hey i'm gay i'm not gay you don't feel  the need to ever have to visit your gayness you know what i'm saying or do you just want to buy the 
[03:30:00]  pen in a utopian society sure that would be great but you know what the money talks here and if you  have funding from these gigantic church corporations funding their their agenda they're going to win  and what do gays what do gays actually want what is what is what they're fighting for what is  proposition eight really for we want the ability to be able to protect our spouses for lack of a better  term right now you know now can you do that with wills can't you do that with wills and and and law 
[03:30:30]  like if something happens you can just you know hey he if something happens to me you get this and  you know i think it's similar things that you can do but it's not yeah they want day day-to-day  stuff too patrice but only if you have a will what like if you if your partner i guess is in the  hospital you can't even visit i think you can you can but if there's no will like if you if your guys  two live together and there's no will uh unless you say there's not a will the the night the spouse  won't get it it'll be the fucking family you know i mean it's like you want you want like basic 
[03:31:00]  stuff you want to bring your partner to let's say a christmas party without people now looking at  you differently and the right they're going to look at you differently i understand that but  they want to start somewhere and how about this the right to make medical decisions like if that's  the one i'm mostly talking about yeah your partner's in the hospital and you're like well i i know what  he would want you have no say in that so is that the issue sir is that oh ma'am i'm sorry all of it  right i think it's more like day-to-day stuff right well not acceptance really the legal stuff 
[03:31:30]  acceptance is is what's going to happen from the people you don't want to be not going to happen  through legal the legal system but just going also to point patrice made which is you know you  have got to stop comparing us to the black uh polite and i agree you know it's it's not the  exact same thing i don't think gays should be saying oh we're in the exact same position as blacks were  uh years ago because we're not you know we're not we're not discriminated against quite as badly but  there still is definitely discrimination there and i'm agree i'm just saying that you're not if if 
[03:32:00]  talking about platforms and how people respond to different things you you you cannot make me  join you on the platform of like on the platform of just hey man i want to be able to this guy i  love i want to be able to decide his whether his organs get to go i want to be able to i want to be  able to be a family member i want to love him and get the same rights from loving him as anyone else  does but to to say it's a civil rights thing in terms of comparing it to what we went through which 
[03:32:30]  is it's just not a choice like if you ask a black person it might be black people that go  you know i don't want to be black like for real i agree with you and um i think the only thing i  could say is i i don't know uh can i can i suck your dick i was gonna say you sound like a reasonable  gay guy like this here's the gay guy that needs to be the gay spokesman but that's just like the  difference is like okay jesse jackson who is the black spokesman by and but he's black like he's 
[03:33:00]  super black right so it's like he's james brown black but it's like gay gay people when people think  of gay they don't think of this fucking guy let me try let me try to bring some comedy back into the  show because it's been about four hours thank you uh sir so if jesse jackson is the black spokesperson  for the black people who would his equivalent be in the gay community  would it be the harvey fire scene exactly 
[03:33:30]  that's what i'm getting at we want to just  we want the right to love shut up sissy that's what i'm getting at  like you know if there was a if there was a republican straight-laced republican lesbian  right who you go oh shit look the lesbian yeah no like sarah palin lesbian sarah palin was a  lesbian or perhaps if condoleezza rice was one yes which but ellen's one ellen is the spokeswoman 
[03:34:00]  she looks like opie if if i just had the same hair as her too oh you know what i'm saying like what  the fuck she's this is like why why am i watching this this bull be the spokesman for gayness if it's  just like somebody like this dude is reasonable and he's not going you know his it's not a you don't  even feel sexual from this group it's just like dude here's what we want and this is how we feel 
[03:34:30]  you're basically there's no emotional like thing that i have to be a tie to and i go hey i'm with you  motherfucker just you want the uh the reasonable straight-sounding gay guy like a lot of white  people respond to that a lot of white people respond to the white-sounding black guy absolutely  who obama is absolutely yeah obama's a fucking harvard guy though him and his wife are harvard  lawyers chris rocks i don't know if word for word but chris rocks bit about how you know  he's he does that whole flavor flave uh yeah comparison he's right too yeah he was like the 
[03:35:00]  first black whatever of the harvard review right he lives he lives a life i don't relate to either  no but we're dealing with we're dealing with feelings based on how we how people are gonna  make you feel better oh by the way steven s from basher the gay equivalent to jesse  jackson we found one worse uh rip torn you know charles nelson i'm sorry rip taylor rip torn rip  taylor but nobody paulin nobody wants to be the object of ridicule right nobody but you understand 
[03:35:30]  intuitively that we can't legislate that we understand that we can't make people not like  like us or dislike us but the things that we can control which is like that guy said wanting equal  protection under the law i think people are very very justified in wanting that and demanding it  people should not to ask for that and i agree with that yeah and and my thing is not society now  it's not it really it's it's it's his if if you didn't learn history if it's possible to get rid of 
[03:36:00]  history it wouldn't be a problem like do people think that fucking indians feel better because they have  casinos now like them motherfuckers are footnotes in history this country  fucked conquered them conquered them all right so we'll get you guys some casinos i'll take that  i'll take that i'll be a little happier the casinos made it a little easier it did but if you ask  an indian they're not gonna go yeah oh feel better hey they were they were they were conquered 
[03:36:30]  what they were the indians were conquered it was i'm not saying it's right or wrong but it is what it  is they were fucking it was a hostile takeover as far as them being fucked it was a conqueror yeah  i don't know how it's different how about we get a few black casinos  i don't know black people because we really need like some kind of like solution as it is now we're  not ready for that solution we're not ready for no black casinos stealing and robbing them  robbing their own casinos there's no machine everyone's playing dice everybody unplugs  motherfuckers unplugging the cameras so they're cheating that dice the 
[03:37:00]  fuck out of here we're not ready for that that's hilarious we're getting ready to play uh what  did we learn on the opian anthony show this the show flew by well we do have this pastor  this is a pretty good story could get to it real fast ooh a juicy apple  we got a texas pastor it's a little mealyer than i like i like a crisper  foodie apple listen to this the setting looks a lot more like a rock concert than a church 
[03:37:30]  uh-oh and the sermon isn't what you might be used to hearing god is pro-sex he thought it up  it was his idea and he wants those of us who have said i do to do it pastor ed young of the fellowship  church in dallas made headlines last week by calling on married couples to have sex every day for a week  that challenge started sunday and runs the next week you show me someone sex-like and i'll show you  the temperature the tone and the tenor of their relationship young's non-denominational church 
[03:38:00]  has a congregation of 20 000 the media attention has given young's challenge far greater power and  it's a topic that we can talk about the with our friends who are non-christians and they're  intrigued that the church is willing to talk about it the church is getting attention for themselves  it's so obvious this guy shut up but he's married though which the fact that priests  are stuck with their dicks in their pants is why it's become a fucking haven 
[03:38:30]  for fucking the people to become a haven for it's because those fucking dumb motherfuckers won't let  the catholics a priest marry those outdated i was asking motherfuckers i was asking questions about  that the other day with somebody i'm like all right so you're a priest you have the feelings  sex is wrong like what is the actual thought on this because the brain because now it's a physical  thing too you got to get as we like to joke on the show the poison out so the priests have to get the 
[03:39:00]  poison out well you know a stunt brain do they jerk off and it's it's like you're taking your morning  vital like what is it they fight and then they lose and then they hide it like everybody i'm not even  talking about all the shit that went wrong i'm talking about the joe priest he's decided uh a  life of celibacy right but he still has the poison in him like what is that all about like  he prays and beats him back with something but the shit has to come out like do we have any  priests that listen to the show i doubt it or maybe that someone knows this do they wait for 
[03:39:30]  the wet dreams are they jerking off but trying but acknowledging that this is just something i have  to do physically it doesn't have to come out they just they pray away like you said or they fight  the urge they put the energy into something else doesn't have to come out it stays in what about  the old the old sperm because jerking off quite frankly for us is like a period for women we got  to get that old nut out right i'm sure the priests feel that way dude they jerk off they  fuck kids sometimes i'm not so they jerk their dick but of course they do and they apologize to god 
[03:40:00]  i'm talking about the guys that are playing by all the rules not the fucking pedos he  fucking he prays he prays for strength and some win and some don't so that's crazy he prays  he prays god and and sometimes don't you have to like it builds up in you and you have don't you  ever jerk off and you i jerk off sometimes and i go i jerk off sometimes and it's not even  sexual it's just like yes i i better do this like i better get it out the way so ultimately sometimes 
[03:40:30]  i go oh damn damn like have you ever had anything you've done what's the moment in your life where  you felt creepy where you went where you went oh my god i just crossed over to something do you mean  like do you mean like after you've come and i'm just guessing no do you mean after you've come  and you have hydrogen peroxide in your mouth because you have in your mouth  like like i mean would it be a moment like that i don't know the first time you did that like i've 
[03:41:00]  done creepier shit than this but i remember this is when i felt creepy and i fought it i jerked off in  a peep booth in new york the first time i jerked off in a peep booth in public in a booth i felt dirty i  felt like a dirty i felt like a motherfucker that like a flasher or i felt like a piece of  shit you know i felt like i was born when that happened that never bothered me i felt like i  felt like a caveman when he first sees the sun getting ready for what did we learn on the opium 
[03:41:30]  at the show second part of the uh the sex story with the with the pastor young delivered his sermon  in front of a bed that he said represented marriage stanchions around the bed represented barriers  like kids and career and if we aren't happy together if our relationship is damaged in any way  we can't give it back to our kids we can't pass it down to the people where we're around and while  young says the church has historically been silent on sex he says sex in the context of marriage  should be talked about it's a god-given thing that he gave us and only the world's view of it has 
[03:42:00]  distorted it we'll see next week but i think it can only help us and strengthen our relationship  so we'll definitely see you know seven days it's uh challenge so i'm up to it we'll know in a week  if the challenge works challenge shut up just getting attention for that particular church  hey uh did you get some yeah that was a bad one we were supposed to do raisin brand monday but  i'm so happy we're supposed to do the complete opposite show that we're doing today i was i was 
[03:42:30]  cutting a couple of hot juicy ones yeah and i fanned them over and it was it was great it was like it was  like an aerial view of watching the troops so i had to do was just i just watched his nose crinkle up  a true crop dusting good you sick hey jim in wayne new jersey priest friend of mine see i don't know  who to believe uh priest friend of mine no they have porn they jerk off again i really want to  know the answer to this you might the ones who don't give into it right like you you're talking 
[03:43:00]  about the ones that don't jerk off which a lot of them don't i'm sure some of them obey the rules  what is the rule of the church if you're trying to be like sin to masturbate of course it's a sin  it's not all that sexual shit they're awful they're repressed and it's dishonest and outdated  and i would understand the human fucking christ care that people jerked off everything that happens  on earth he was christ watched a leper's tootsies he doesn't care if people are fucking whacking their  bags if we murdered each other like a like a lion murders antelope it wouldn't be a sin it's a sin 
[03:43:30]  because we created the idea that that whole that god and evil and good and the devil if i if i if i  ate a motherfucker and i hunted them down because i was hungry that shit is not that  shit ain't a sin it ain't a fucking sin that's right uh fast freddy starts it i learned today patrice  is scared of the reindeer on the merit parkway that goofy fuck 
[03:44:00]  the merit's scary man that's a i think we went too local but that road is  fucking scary especially at night it gets you to boston very fast i know it's the shortest way  pretty much but that is a scary fucking road you want the stinger yeah oh we have the stinger  the brand new stinger for what did we learn on the opie and anthony show  what did we learn 
[03:44:30]  i like it it's got style it's got pizzazz it's awesome it's melodic people are like arguing you  know line of the day what did we learn we're just changing it up that's all we'll go back to line of  the day yeah we'll have fun no worries also i'm gonna go to whack bag i want to see what uh the  listeners uh would vote their top five comedians i think it's pretty much going to be prior carlin 
[03:45:00]  the more you think about it shouldn't be lenny though it should be prior carlin but we'll see  what they you know don't let us influence it just name your top five comedians let's get a poll  going i really want to see what the listeners would put it in number three i'm kidding don't put  norton because that would only disgust patrice and voss and colin and it would wreck our whole  fucking poll no i was saying that i think it would be a very legitimate choice yeah sure sure  the fact that you said go to whack bag and ask that you think they're gonna have prior carlin 
[03:45:30]  they're not gonna have prior carlin oh yes they will do sure they will if they're being honest you  gotta believe they love those guys they're not they're not that uh carlin more so just because  he performed up until like last year whereas prior kind of stopped in 83 and uh it was harder  for prior because so many people have stolen his shit since him people who like prior stuff  like when you listen to it doesn't hit you the same way because socially the country has changed  and so many a lot of people who grew up not watching prior who grew up say starting with murphy and guys 
[03:46:00]  after him then see prior afterwards and it's like oh the black thing they're not seeing they've seen  the carbon copies before they've seen the original which is is it's like people who watch the american  office before they watch the british office a lot of them will enjoy the american office and they go  the british one instead of understanding the british one british way better but they're two different  shows now yeah i like the american office but i don't i don't compare the two anymore adam in detroit 
[03:46:30]  today i learned that the indians were xm and the white man was serious that's pretty good actually  that's a damn good point uh you know what uh i gotta say i spent most of the weekend just spinning  around the old dial the old satellite radio dial we got some fine choices through this murder i  fucking did the same say that yep some of the djs guys shut the fuck up and stop acting like regular  radio guys because that's not what this whole thing's about i mean you have to look down and go oh  that's right i'm listening to satellite because some of these guys are acting like they did in the 
[03:47:00]  regular radio world you don't have to do that yeah another fart going i just i did the same  thing i was hair nation is i love hair i like boneyard better than hair nation i love boneyard person  uh first wave is way better than fred ever was i never heard fred it's just all that new wave  stuff they play a lot more they play more hits which i don't mind because regular radio is not  really focusing on uh a new wave for the most part they'll do an hour here and there channel 18 what's 
[03:47:30]  18 elvis oh the elvis channel i don't love the acdc channel um or the zeppelin one i like both of  those bands channel but i don't think that they have the catalogs that elvis did as far as the  amount of different shit you could play you have to pay for this um no because the merger like you  know they just gave you more choices i i love it i did i mean just right some of my favorite  channels radio these are things you have yeah they got like like they got the jimmy buffett channel  i'm not a huge fan but i'm not a great but i checked it out and in between doing buffett songs they 
[03:48:00]  they had a cool uh allman brothers jam like right on man one thing they got to do which is  dumb that they haven't figured this out and this might have something to do with free subs and cars  i don't know but we can't get if you're an employee we have a free account because we're employees  right we can't get like howard 100 or any of these other ones that they're promoting like that  are paid channels like football and a lot of the serious employees might not be able to get open  it's like that's just we're the guys it's just what's an oversight we're the guys you should be  giving it to for free because we can talk about it and i can't report on howard 100 or i can't 
[03:48:30]  report on fucking the nfl their coverage on serious because i can't hear it and we try to get it and  they're like yeah pay for it what we're the ones that are going to be pushing this out for you you  should be smart business they want to read promos about how great it is how about you give it to us  for free i've never heard them so we can listen because here we are doing a uh a little set on the  changes and we can't comment about martha howard any of them because i have not heard their channels  i haven't heard nascar radio in fuck how long now couple years they should figure out a way to do

[03:53:00]  yours honey you said a lot of things that's sick of me but this one is up there is that a woman  fucking you in your ass and that's all they really want to do dude have you fuck you in your ass have  you ever had the special belt nope i told you that the closest why are you looking at me they want to be  to fuck her oh please i'm nurse pig in in vegas same class i know who used to piss in my mouth and  spit on me um but we're off the air now tell me the truth she uh took the strap on and i had no real  desire to ever be fucked with the strap up and you just made up no no no no like a grunting noise 
[03:53:30]  she looked there was something bizarrely sexy about her in that because it was so perverse  and because i thought she was so sexy so she knelt between my legs  and she was slapping my ass with it and it was so dirty that she was doing this and so  inappropriate i liked it because she was dirty um but then when she pushed it i she tried to push  it and it hurt and i stopped her because that's not a desire it's not a physical feeling that i want  um but with her it was such a perverse because she was like a golden shower mistress who would also 
[03:54:00]  fuck you which is rare that you get that combo and literally she'd be pissing in my mouth go that's  to drink your wife's piss she weren't if this is gay because you know a lot of the mentality behind  a lot of feelings what if i watch a thing where a girl straps on i want to i have never done it but  a girl that straps on fucks another girl and i go behind the other girl that's fucking that girl and  like lick her asshole and no i don't i don't think any of it's gay because it's all i wouldn't be gay
