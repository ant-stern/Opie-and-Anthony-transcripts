<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's introduction.  The hosts—Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton—immediately launched into a spirited discussion of sports, dissecting a Yankees-Red Sox doubleheader, expressing considerable frustration with the pitching decisions and umpire calls.  They also covered NFL games, focusing on the Jets' and Patriots' losses and the Lions' surprising success.  The UFC 135 fight between Jon Jones and Rampage Jackson was enthusiastically analyzed, with Norton mentioning his UFC fighter cousin, Matt Hughes.  The segment continued with a hilarious and scathing account of their experience at a wrestling convention, particularly focusing on the underwhelming performance of Virgil and contrasting it with their interactions with Bret Hart and Harley Race.  A photo of Virgil at his sparsely attended autograph table was described in detail. The segment included sexually explicit descriptions.

Following this, Jim Brewer shared a bizarre anecdote about cleaning up his son after a messy bowel movement in Dubuque, Iowa.  The conversation then shifted to SiriusXM's *Nevermind* 20th-anniversary special, hosted by Jon Stewart, sparking debate about Stewart's Nirvana fandom and the blurring of the album cover's naked baby in promotional material. Dave Grohl, Chris Novoselic, and Butch Vig were mentioned as guests. A caller offered fly fishing tips, leading to a discussion of Opie and Anthony's recent fly fishing trip to Roscoe, New York.  They recounted catching (and accidentally catching) fish and their subsequent heated confrontation with the Roscoe Motel owner, who refused them lodging after seeing negative listener comments on their videos.  The motel was repeatedly referred to as a "shithole," and audio of the altercation was played.  They ultimately stayed at the Baxter House.  The discussion continued with further details about the Roscoe Motel reviews, the fly fishing trip, and contrasting preferences for luxury versus roughing it.

Further discussion of the negative Roscoe Motel experience followed, including vulgar descriptions of the motel and the interaction with the owner (or possibly daughter), with one host expressing regret for his harsh words.  Kenny's efforts to secure alternative accommodations were also detailed.  The conversation transitioned to Anthony’s encounter with Occupy Wall Street protesters, described as entertaining and involving an unexpected police escort.  This was followed by Jim Norton's characteristically offensive bit about vaginal self-esteem. A lengthy discussion of the Beatles ensued, covering various albums and songs, including a vulgar and sexually suggestive analysis of "Yellow Submarine."  Justin Bieber's Staples Center "Titanic" date with Selena Gomez was critiqued, focusing on Bieber’s perceived lack of masculinity and the event’s potential for publicity. This led to a graphic description of a beheading video viewed by one of the hosts, including a discussion on the desensitizing effect of such content.  The show concluded with a discussion of Radiohead's *Saturday Night Live* appearance and upcoming concert.

The show resumed with a discussion of Radiohead's upcoming appearances on *Saturday Night Live* and *The Colbert Report*, along with their small venue concert, and their music, specifically "Creep" and "Karma Police."  This segued into a discussion about Howard Stern's new studio, with the hosts expressing envy over its superior features and contrasting it with their own poor studio lighting.  A caller mentioned a video of Howard Stern's new studio.  The conversation then returned to the Occupy Wall Street protests, with audio clips played and the hosts expressing skepticism and cynicism about the protesters' motives and methods.  A caller, Peter, engaged in a heated debate with the hosts about wealth inequality, capitalism, and personal responsibility, using strong and offensive language.

A significant portion was dedicated to the Occupy Wall Street protests, focusing on the hosts' cynicism about the movement's effectiveness and anger towards the perceived lack of accountability for financial malfeasance.  A solar energy company scandal and the lenient treatment of Bernie Madoff were also discussed.  This led to a segment featuring "Chip," marked by uncomfortable jokes and bizarre comments.  Banter between the hosts and interns Matt and Sal highlighted Matt's perceived ineptitude and inappropriate behavior.  Upcoming guests Sebastian Bach and Michael K. Williams were mentioned.  A substantial part of the show was dedicated to playing and discussing audio recordings of a disastrous date arranged by the show between Bobo and Jackie, leading to Bobo’s banishment from the show.  The show concluded with closing remarks and a brief discussion of missing studio equipment during the "after show" with Sam Roberts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it, got it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM satellite radio.  Oh, fuck yeah, this place is insane.  You guys like to cuss on that, right?  Yeah, I think a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  The show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well then, turn off.  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Morning.  Wah. 
[00:04:30]  Stupid Jets.  That's right, my stupid Yankees.  You're all right, though.  Yeah, I know, but it was just annoying.  14 innings after a doubleheader, and they put in that friggin' piece of shit.  It was a good little pitching battle going on.  They pretty much dragged everybody that meant anything in the game out.  The playoff game or a regular game?  It's a regular game, but it was Yankee Sox.  It was a doubleheader.  They soundly beat them in the first game. 
[00:05:00]  And then it was tied four up in the ninth for the second game, so they go extra innings.  And it's going back and forth.  It's pretty good.  Both teams getting the opportunities, but being shut down by some decent reliever pitching.  And then you put in a proctor who just sucks.  Sounds like quite a gamble.  Right when they put him in, I'm just going, oh, God, his record stinks. 
[00:05:30]  And the announcers had just said also, it's like, just an amazing pitcher's duel going on here as far as the relievers go.  And I'm like, good, thanks for the jinx.  And then he walks like two guys, and then fucking L's shit comes up for fucking Sox. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, though.  I don't understand the anger.  Even the Yankees know it doesn't matter.  The second game, they kind of just sat everybody.  The anger is that they had opportunities to pretty much put the Sox at zero games ahead for the wild card spot.  Yeah, but last week, and we could pull the audio, you kind of hinted you wouldn't mind seeing the Sox in it because it makes it fun.  Yeah, but when you're watching the game, you just want to see the Yankees beat the Sox. 
[00:06:30]  Because we had this discussion last week, and you're like, you know what, I wouldn't mind the Red Sox in there.  It makes it a little more fun.  Yeah.  But now you don't think so.  No, I'd rather just the city of Boston be completely disappointed before even the playoffs.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's kind of how I'm feeling about the whole thing.  Well, they're a little bummed out today because the Pats lost to the Bills.  Yeah.  And then the Jets took a shit, too, huh?  Well, Camardi just fucking had a horrendous game, and that's why the Jets lost. 
[00:07:00]  Simple as that.  Yeah.  Sorry, Raiders fans, but there you go.  Who's Camardi?  Just one of the Jets, one of the fucking star players.  He had fucking turnovers left and right.  Apple or something?  Raiders beat him 34-24.  Fuck!  Fuck.  I watched that last touchdown.  I was in the gym doing the elliptical.  Which one?  Sanchez diving?  Downstairs.  Yeah, it was the last one that was with a minute left.  When Sanchez dove for it and his knee was down, they're saying? 
[00:07:30]  Even though technically his knee was down.  It was down.  At least, you know what, though?  It still annoyed me because I'm like, that to me, it's like, it wasn't like his face was  on the ground.  That was kind of like forward motion.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'd like to see a guy extend a little bit for the, but it's like.  Since that knee's down, that's it, though.  I know.  The ball's got to be over the fucking goal line.  I mean, it's easy to do the old Monday morning quarterback shit, but I don't know why they  didn't kick the field goal there.  The Jets need a field goal and a touchdown.  They went for it on fourth down, and Sanchez was just short. 
[00:08:00]  But it's like, why not?  It's fourth down.  Play it safe, because you still got to get the fucking ball back anyway.  And you got to go onside.  You know, I mean, you know, they were in deep trouble, obviously, so.  But whatever.  Six of one, half dozen of the other.  A lot of people saying they should just kick the fucking field goal at that point, even  though they were so goddamn close, because they still had to fucking get the ball back  anyway.  Yeah.  You know?  Get a guarantee.  That field goal was a guarantee.  Fucking do the onside. 
[00:08:30]  Hope to get lucky, and then get lucky after that, and then maybe a little more luck after  that.  Yeah, a little more luck, and then some luck.  Camardi fucked us yesterday.  Simple as that.  What's he, a running back?  Yeah, he's actually the backup quarterback, too.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  And Girardi got thrown out of the game.  And it was pretty funny.  It was just a shit fucking call at first, man.  Really?  Just a shit call at first.  One of the Red Sox was definitely out at first, and he called him safe. 
[00:09:00]  He jacked in the 13th inning.  It was so obvious to everybody else, and then Girardi got in his face, and the ump does that  funny little, you know.  You're out of here.  I love when they just lean back, and they take their hand and go, yeah!  Get out of here!  So how many games are left?  Three.  You do realize football season's three weeks in already.  So how cares?  Elizabeth wants to know, how does the third row fold? 
[00:09:30]  I don't care what Elizabeth needs to know.  Elizabeth wants to know.  Three games left?  Three games left.  Red Sox are up by, what were you telling me, a game?  Now the Red Sox are up by a game.  Um, but, uh, if the Yankees just kick back and, uh, let, uh, the, uh, Tampa Bay just kind  of roll over them, then they can fuck the Sox that way.  Right.  But, uh...  So do you want the Sox in it or not?  I don't know!  Just get the Sox in there so you guys can yell and scream and beat the shit out of each 
[00:10:00]  other.  I don't know!  That makes baseball fun in October while the rest of us watch football.  I don't know, though.  Should they be in?  And then hockey starts...  They don't deserve to be in, first of all.  They've dropped so many fucking games of Sox.  They just...  They're stinking up the joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a hell of a jump.  Hilarious.  He missed the plate, though.  Yeah, he goes back.  Go back and touch that shit.  You don't know. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.  But I just hate friggin' seeing the Yankees at Fagway.  You know, that whole thing.  A bunch of assholes.  What happened to you?  What happened to me?  I never liked that fucking park.  Oh my god, that guy's out!  He never liked the Sox.  Wait, why didn't he tag him when he came back?  I don't know.  Just another shit call, I gather.  That's terrible.  Did you ever go to a game?  That wasn't even the bad call.  You ever go to a game at Fenway?  Oh, yeah.  It's kind of cool.  No, it isn't.  You don't like it? 
[00:11:00]  It stinks.  They're dumb, green monster.  He called him safe?  What happened?  That wasn't the call I was talking about.  I was talking about a call at first, but that one was over.  Did that guy run and touch the base again?  I think he did, yeah.  But he tagged him on the way up, right?  Yeah, there you go.  He tagged him on his ass.  Yeah.  That's a terrible call.  He tagged him there when he was going over.  Yeah, that wasn't even the play that long.  I fucking hate umpires.  Girardi was thrown out in the 13th.  And then it's like, oh god, you're just watching.  All right, they can do it now. 
[00:11:30]  They can do it now.  And all right, there's strike three.  And all that work, gone.  Go ahead.  And then they put Proctor in, who just proceeded to walk everybody and then cough up a fucking  three-run homer.  Bless you.  Oh, I hate that.  I know.  Watch and go on.  I mean, I don't know why they put him in.  How many hours of baseball was that?  Holy shit.  It was like five hours.  The second game.  Was five hours alone?  It was like five hours.  They'd already played a game in the afternoon. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And then they played the second game of the doubleheader.  Right.  And then tack on, you know, another five innings onto that.  Another more than half a game onto that.  So how many hours was the whole doubleheader?  Oh, it was crazy.  You're talking fucking, you know, eight hours of baseball.  Easily.  Yeah.  Probably more.  Probably more.  Where's time for that?  But everybody was sitting.  It's just like, it's funny to just watch, you know, Jeter and A-Rod and stuff are just  leaning on the rail, looking, watching, watching these guys that you've never heard their name 
[00:12:30]  playing.  Really?  It's like, oh, you're a Yankee?  That's a good night's sleep.  Yeah.  You could have went to bed and woke up and they would just be finishing this doubleheader.  And they pretty much had to get done and then go right to the airport.  Why?  What happens now?  And go down to Florida.  For the last three games?  And that's it.  So, you know, hopefully the Yankees will be real sleepy and drop a couple of games.  And, you know, fuck the Red Sox. 
[00:13:00]  Wait, if the Yankees lose, Red Sox are...  How's this working?  Well, because they're playing Tampa Bay.  They're playing the Rays.  Yeah.  So if they lose, Red Sox are fucked?  Well, I mean, the Red Sox still have to win their games.  They have to win their games.  But they're going to win their games.  They're going to win their games.  You know what?  Well, no, they're not.  They're facing the Orioles, so they'll probably...  No, the Orioles suck.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, but, you know...  They've been in a slide, too.  They've lost 18 games this month. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  But why would you bring all the mean guys down to Florida if you got this wrapped up?  Have them relaxing.  Have them getting spa treatments for the next three or four days.  You want them to still play and fucking, you know, stay limber.  Let them get all relaxed for the playoffs.  You want them to stay limber.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't realize baseball was still going on.  Yeah.  Can't concentrate on any football shit.  I saw, like, I'm going through the channels and I see football.  I'm like, what am I going to do?  What am I going to do? 
[00:14:00]  How about you watch a little?  Sit there and watch a football game.  You got the Bills in first place in the AFC.  AFC East.  That's insane.  And they beat the Pats for the first time in eight years, I think.  Yeah.  There was some shit going down yesterday.  Some shit going down.  And the Jets lose to those damn Raiders.  As it were.  Yes.  Who else?  What other big games yesterday in football, Travis?  What game did you like?  I liked the Ravens game, but that wasn't a really good one. 
[00:14:30]  No?  Well, no.  They blew them out.  I like the Lions.  I mean, the Lions are fucking 3-0.  Yeah, I know.  That's insane.  People are killing me on Twitter.  Good for you.  I think it's great.  Lions 3-0, whatever.  They lost 16 games two years ago.  I hear the Lions have a pretty good team.  I don't know shit about the Lions, though.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe.  Colts almost beat the Steelers last night.  Yeah.  But they're 0-3.  Yeah.  And Curry Collins, who didn't even want to play football this year, might have a concussion  now.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  He left the game in the fourth quarter. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  What a disaster.  I feel so bad for this guy.  He was just retired, and now he's got medical issues.  Now he's got medical issues.  He was enjoying his retirement, and he was probably playing golf, and now he's dealing  with a concussion.  Now he's going to be nothing.  For a shitty team, what is he doing?  Wouldn't you call up the Colts and go, all right, enough.  I'm done.  You guys figure it out.  I don't need to do this.  Did you see Doug Flutie as we left Friday?  Yeah, man.  He doesn't look like he could have ever played in the NFL.  Small guy.  He's tiny.  Yeah.  Now I get it, because I've seen him live. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Dude, he's like Jim Norton's size.  Small guy.  Aw.  Are you taller than him?  No.  I have a photo of it.  I'll tell you.  Oh.  I was like, who is that?  That's Flutie.  I love that Jimmy wants pictures with people.  He has to ask, who is that first?  I just knew he was a man of importance.  A man of importance.  He just couldn't see over the front line was his problem.  Yeah.  I mean, he's a great fucking college quarterback, obviously.  Doug Flutie is 5'10". 
[00:16:00]  There's no fucking way he's 5'10".  Doug Flutie claims to be 5'10".  He's not even close to 5'10".  5'10".  I would give him maybe 5'8".  Are you trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere?  Maybe 5'8".  There's no fucking way, man.  Greatest achievement of all time, though, has to be his Flutie Flakes.  Remember the Flutie Flakes for charity?  And I guess he played in Canada, but we don't acknowledge Canadian football here, do we?  No, that's not football.  Of course not. 
[00:16:30]  He's a few inches taller than me, definitely.  And how tall are you?  5'4".  5'4".  Yeah, I'm 4'4".  He's a midget.  So is it possible he's 5'10"?  Yeah.  Or 5'8", 5'9".  Yeah.  God, am I ugly.  Oh, stop it.  Let's see your picture with the incomparable Doug Flutie.  Ugly fat zilch.  What is going on already today? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, Ant goes, oh, yeah.  No, no.  I mean, Flutie's got, you know, some inches on him.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah.  Flutie's got some inches on Macaulay Culkin, who I guess.  You know what, though?  What the fuck is that about?  Who was here?  But you got to think Flutie's got a little padding in his step.  Yeah.  I bet you he has a little lift in there.  Wearing some lifts.  Do you have lifts?  I don't know.  So you don't have lifts, and I would give him at least an inch and a half lifts.  He got the hair, though.  I advocate lifts.  I'm a devil's advocate. 
[00:17:30]  Like eating large quantities of chocolate.  Get away.  Get away.  You going to watch the Cowboys games, Matt, Jim?  Who are they playing?  Redskins.  No, really?  Nah, I just don't give a fuck.  You should.  Romo might not play.  But you think Romo, you think the Cowboys go, hey, look, Norton's doing a fucking, he  did a piece on Fashion Week and Lenny, you guys are going to watch?  Don't give a fuck.  Fuck them.  But that's not how it works.  I know, but that's why.  They're not supposed to watch you, so you watch them.  You just decide if you want to watch them or not. 
[00:18:00]  No, I know, but I just have such a lack of interest in them.  Yeah.  I might watch them.  It's like, I still like to see the Cowboys.  Will you ever get back into sports?  I know you're into UFC.  Big time.  That's what I love.  That's my sport.  UFC 135 went down.  We found a fucking place to watch the game up there in Roscoe, New York, and this John  Jones, holy shit.  He's fucking awesome, man.  Beat up on Rampage Jackson.  Beat him up.  Yeah?  Beat him up.  Rampage.  Soundly?  Yeah.  Rampage looked a little scared in there, didn't he, Jimmy?  He just, he didn't know what to do, and Rogan had called it. 
[00:18:30]  It was that, it was Rampage wasn't using his legs at all.  He was, he kicks okay when he kicks, but he was just kind of boxing him, and fucking,  he did what like a lightweight does.  He just kicked his legs.  Yeah.  He just kept kicking Rampage's legs.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Rampage looks a little doughy there in the midsection, huh?  And Rampage at the end said, I thought he looked a little soft, but.  He said, this is the best I've ever been.  Really?  Shape-wise, he goes, I'm in the best shape of my career.  He just was better.  What's this guy?  Like a crab.  No, he was trying, he was thinking of doing something, but he didn't do it.  It was, it was, it was. 
[00:19:00]  What, getting, getting punched in the face as he tries to come in on all fours?  He was going to try to get his legs quickly.  He was going to try to shoot.  He was going to try to shoot him.  Not literally, you know, just kind of take him down.  Yeah, it didn't work.  And then Rampage, well, Rampage kicked a little there, but.  He should be working those legs right now.  Wham!  Wham!  Wham!  John Jones, right now, he's pushing Rampage up against the cage, and he's just, his legs  are so fucking spindly.  He's just all over you.  He's got like daddy long legs.  You're like, just get off me.  Really long arms, really long legs.  His elbows. 
[00:19:30]  Praying mantis.  His elbows come in at you like a fist, because they're so long.  Yeah.  They come across.  He's lanky.  But he's much stronger than he looks, because he's solid muscle, and he's tall, so he looks  thin, but he's not, he's like a rock.  What'd you say, he's 205?  Rampage.  That's the weight, yeah.  Yeah, his knees are terrible.  Oh, it's gotta hurt those knobby knees that he's got.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fucking.  Oh.  And then when he climbs on you, his fucking big long feet just lock in around your waist.  It's like, oh.  Like, Rampage has him in a. 
[00:20:00]  They're in against the cage right now.  He's got a headlock thingy.  Yeah, this was a long fight.  Yeah, it was.  Rampage hung in there.  Until the third round, I think, right?  Let me see the ass kicking there.  Can you go forward on this bitch?  I'm not sure now.  Let's take a little look, see around the.  The fight was scheduled for five, five-minute rounds, right?  Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, five rounds.  It might have went into the fourth.  I'm thinking it might have went into the fourth, I think.  I think it went into the fourth.  Oh, maybe.  And then Rampage's kicking a little bit, and when he kicked, that close the distance,  because when he kicks, now, then Jones is kicking him. 
[00:20:30]  He's fucking.  And there's nothing worse than a guy that just kicks your calves and fucking thighs.  Yeah, that's got to get annoying.  Terrible.  Like, it's got to be.  It's got to make you mad.  Like, stop it already with your kicking.  The most important part here is Jon Jones' reach advantage was almost a foot, right,  Mars?  Yeah.  Yes.  Almost a foot.  Eleven and a half inches.  Rampage looks a little tired.  Yeah, Rampage, he's just standing there.  Jon Jones has his arms down, and Rampage is standing there, not throwing punches at him, 
[00:21:00]  because he's afraid of walking into that foot.  Oh, and then he does the.  That's the end of the round.  That was the end of the round.  He just kind of tossed him off him.  Threw him over his head.  Yeah.  And then we go into the fourth.  It was in the fourth.  Okay.  And this must be.  He's just putting Rampage.  Rampage is against the fence.  But he's got him pinned up against the cage, and he's on top.  Nice elbow.  Bad position for Quinton.  Oh.  What is he like kicking?  Yeah.  Rashad and Tito Ortiz. 
[00:21:30]  And then just climbs on you.  He's got his back.  Oh, righty.  Okay.  He's got one hook.  Oh, shit.  He's hooking him in?  Yeah, he's got the choke hold on him.  He's not been stopped in the octagon.  That's what Jones wants.  To be the first man in the UFC to stop.  Quinton Rampage, Jackson's got him.  Looking to do it right here.  Looking to finish this fight.  He's trying to pry it off.  And he taps.  He was being totally choked out.  Jesus.  Dripping blood on the mat. 
[00:22:00]  Boy, he locked in that choke.  That was it.  He's a strong guy.  Because Rampage is a fucking strong dude, man.  Not at that point.  Wrong guy.  But to see him just helpless in that hold.  He got him.  And then when he flipped him over.  And just how the fuck do you survive that for a second?  Like he's there.  And he's like, you know, I'm in some bad shit.  But I think.  And then he's like, all right, I'll tap.  How do you not just like pass out in a second? 
[00:22:30]  He hasn't been submitted that way.  It was the first time.  It was the first time.  I wonder if the second he got into that hold, he went.  Made that sound.  Made the Jimmy sound.  You know what?  I know how unpleasant those holds are.  Right.  From feeling one hundredth of that.  Right.  From a guy who's not trying to hurt me.  And it's more amazing to me that that's like.  That it takes even that long to tap.  Yeah.  That'd be instantly like.  I think he might be getting the hold in.  Stop.  Don't get it.  This hurts. 
[00:23:00]  Jones is great.  Him and Silva, people want to see a lot of weight difference.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think he would handle Anderson Silva like that.  I don't know.  This John Jones is unbelievable.  He's easy.  Yeah, they got to figure out the weight thing.  Yeah.  To get those two together, obviously.  The weight thing.  There's a weight thing between the two guys.  So that was good.  Yeah, man.  And then Matt Hughes is pretty much done, huh?  Yeah.  His career is over.  Kostrick beat him up.  He's won the most in the UFC, I think, right?  I don't know.  Morris, Matt Hughes, most victories in the UFC? 
[00:23:30]  When are you going to call him?  Well, I'll probably call him today.  Yeah?  I want to give him a day or two, you know.  Yeah.  He's had a hell of a career, though, in the UFC.  Is that a cousin?  Yeah, he's a cousin.  18 is the most wins in the UFC.  You didn't know that, Morris?  Matt Hughes is my cousin.  I see the resemblance in the body type.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  The body type.  Thank you, sir.  Weird.  I can't get over Curry Collins.  I'm sorry.  I'm going back to Curry Collins. 
[00:24:00]  This poor fucking guy.  He was retired, enjoying his life, and now he's somewhere with a concussion.  What the fuck am I doing?  He's getting busted up with his big gut.  His fucking fat gut.  His, I'm not in shape to play, but what the hell.  I need the spotlight still, so I'm coming back.  The only one with a body like that that could still play a sport is like a fucking pitcher.  Yeah.  Pitchers can have that gut and just kind of...  Chew on some shit and just pitch.  Jog over to first every so often. 
[00:24:30]  But, yeah, to be a quarterback like that is just ludicrous to have that gut.  Another thing sports-related, it could be sports entertainment-related.  Love that.  Mr. Roberts.  I saw your fucking picture, which, again, it's like you have a personal vendetta against  this man.  It's not a personal vendetta.  It's just I see history repeating itself all the time.  Is that it?  Well, where were you? 
[00:25:00]  You visited...  Sinamania.  Sinamania.  And I guess this is where old wrestlers go to die, and they spend their last few months  or years signing things.  And again, again, he has a picture of Virgil at a table with no one even near him trying  to get an autograph or memorabilia announced on the show.  He's just now...  He shows up at every autograph signing. 
[00:25:30]  Puts up his dumb picture of him with the Million Dollar Man.  And the Million Dollar Man wasn't there.  Of course not.  And the Million Dollar Man is bigger in the poster than Virgil is.  Of course.  Virgil's just his servant.  And Virgil is sitting there...  Oh, my God.  ...just leaning his head on his fucking hand.  And you know what we caught him doing?  Because my friend I went with asked if I thought Virgil would be there, because he was excited  about just getting to see...  Oh, the empty table?  The empty table in person.  And Virgil, we caught him.  He goes to other vendor tables and tries to get merchandise and stuff at a discount, because 
[00:26:00]  he's Virgil.  And then he resells it at his table.  For at a profit.  Like, the same day.  Like, he goes, how many people got his autograph?  Not very many.  I mean, I...  Obviously, when you look at the complete lack...  And not only that, I guess he's on some type of white...  Is that a rug or something?  Something...  It's pristinely clean.  Like, there's no footprints. 
[00:26:30]  You can tell there hasn't been any foot traffic walking up to that...  There's no impression in the rug or no little mud prints.  I mean, I had just pushed through lines at other tables trying to get this picture.  Now, who had a big line?  Well, I mean, Bret the Hitman Hart was there with a massive line.  No doubt.  You had Scott Steiner, Big Papa Pump.  Well, he's Big Papa Pump.  That's right.  I used to like Big Papa Pump.  Big Papa Pump.  He was such an asshole, I liked him.  Did Vince McMahon hate Big Papa Pump? 
[00:27:00]  Excuse me.  Well, I don't know if Vince McMahon could use Big Papa Pump that much.  He was such an obnoxious asshole.  Yes, looking at more natural bodies.  He doesn't have the most natural-looking body in the world.  And he didn't know how to wrestle, really.  No, he injured a couple people, but...  But he was good on the mic.  He was an asshole.  He rocked the mic.  He did.  Now, when you're in those crowds online waiting for someone like, you know, the Hitman or something  like that, is it nice to go to Virgil's table and be able to go, ah, I'm not surrounded 
[00:27:30]  by people.  I could stretch a little bit.  You want to get someone to save your spot online, then you walk over in front of Virgil's  table and do jumping jacks or whatever.  You could talk in a civil, low tone to a friend.  You could whisper.  Yeah.  I mean, if there's a secret to tell.  There's absolutely no one there to get in your way.  Like if I wanted to call home or something, I could make a phone call there without a problem.  From Virgil's table.  Yeah, because they could hear me.  Does he look sad?  I don't know.  He just sits there.  I'm thinking we could give him Earl's job at the Hard Rock Cafe if he needs a gig. 
[00:28:00]  What is that?  You know, Earl, what does Earl do at the Hard Rock again?  What's his vibe coordinator?  Vibe coordinator.  Vibe manager.  Vibe manager.  Maybe we could give Virgil that job.  Maybe that's what Virgil was doing at the convention, just making sure the vibe was  right.  The vibe was good.  Walk around.  The Killer Bees were there.  Oh, wow.  Mr. Wonderful.  Mr. Wonderful.  Yep.  I thought Mr. Wonderful was dead.  No, no, no.  Oh, Mr. Perfect's dead.  Mr. Perfect's dead.  They're all dead.  What about Mr. Fuji?  They're all dead.  Mr. Fuji's alive, but I think he has Alzheimer's.  What other misters are done? 
[00:28:30]  He just goes around the fucking old folks home throwing salt in people's face.  In old people's faces.  Yeah.  For a while, he was tearing tickets at a movie theater.  It's a sad state of affairs.  Oh, wow.  It really is.  Those guys don't get pensions or anything, huh?  No, there's no pensions.  You can always get a table like Virgil and sell your wares.  Did Bobby the Brain Heenan make fun of Virgil being at this thing?  No.  I think I stumbled upon a tweet.  No, there's a Twitter called Bobby Heenan Says that I follow where they just take quotes 
[00:29:00]  from old Bobby Heenan clips of wrestling.  Why don't they get new quotes?  But I read something where they said, why is Virgil there?  He's not a superstar.  They had a quote from Bobby Heenan saying, the name of this show is DWF Superstars, so  who invited Virgil?  But no, Bobby the Brain Heenan.  Oh, but that's not Bobby.  He was supposed to be there, but he took a fall in his home, and he couldn't make his  East Coast appearance at all.  Isn't it true he has less brain these days?  No, he has the same amount of brain, less jaw. 
[00:29:30]  Less jaw.  Oh, he's got that going on?  Less jaw.  He's got the Ebert.  No, he's still got his flesh.  Did he have his fucking jaw taken out?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Cancer.  Smoker?  Was he a smoker?  I don't know.  Pole smoker.  Maybe.  And what about, was Brutus the Barber Beefcake there?  Unfortunately not.  Here's where we go into a diatribe of dead wrestlers that will not end.  The Superfly was there.  Jimmy Snuka?  Yeah, brother.  Okay, brother.  How is he sounding?  He's great. 
[00:30:00]  Did he have a big line?  He was there all day, though, so eventually it...  You know who didn't have a big line at all?  The Rock's father, Rocky Johnson.  Oh, poor Rocky Johnson.  He was just sitting there next to the bathroom all day.  Overshadowed by his son, the great actor, Dwayne Johnson.  What does Virgil do to make believe that he's not alone behind that table?  Well, he starts, as people walk by, he tries to get their attention and start conversation  with...  Right, and then he tries to charge them for stuff.  Why didn't you film that? 
[00:30:30]  I didn't want to film stuff.  I'm just there...  Film Virgil being pathetic.  Because...  That picture says it all.  Sometimes you only need a photo.  True.  So, wait, how will he start conversations and get people to buy stuff?  He'll just grab people as they walk by and say, hey, how you doing, man?  And then it's a wrestling fan.  It's Virgil.  Oh, hey, Virgil.  How's it going?  And then he'll talk.  And as the conversation goes on, he's like, so what do you want?  An 8x10?  Do you want me to sign something?  Oh, no.  He really tries too hard.  Or they'll be like, yeah, yeah.  He's like, can I sign something for you? 
[00:31:00]  Like, the guy's in Times Square.  He's just worked Times Square.  I was going to say that.  Yeah, yeah.  Just work Times Square.  And then the price goes up.  Like, I've talked to him before.  And it's like, you know, how much is it for a picture and an autograph?  And he's like, oh, it's $25.  Oh, okay.  And then he'll give you the autograph and he'll go, okay, $30.  And then as you're counting the money, he's like, so you got $35.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That's literally what happens.  He's hurting.  But he's at every single convention.  I can't imagine.  What else is he going to do?  He probably loses money, though, on the travel expenses. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine anybody who wants a meet and greet with Virgil who hasn't gotten one.  So do those guys know you by now?  Are you still waiting in line or no?  No, I didn't even.  Like, this time, I waited in line for one guy and got a picture with one guy.  Who?  King Harley Race.  King Harley Race?  I remember King Harley Race.  Former champion of the world, Harley Race.  Wasn't everybody?  Well, I mean, no.  Virgil never was champion of the world.  Virgil was ever.  But the million dollar man was. 
[00:32:00]  The million dollar.  No, well, he built the belt.  Oh, I see the million dollar belt on the table.  Yes, because Virgil at one point beat the million dollar man for the million dollar belt.  So he proclaims himself former million dollar champion.  My favorite Virgil story is when E-Rock.  Oh, no.  He had his most prized possession.  I hate him.  His most prized possession is his replica million dollar title belt.  Oh, what?  E-Rock hates him.  Virgil.  Because E-Rock has walked around this office carrying his million dollar title belt like 
[00:32:30]  it's show and tell.  Wow.  And it's not like a toy replica.  It's like a replica replica.  Right.  And he went to a convention to get Ted DiBiase to sign the belt.  And he was there with Virgil.  Oh, no.  So, uh, he gives Ted DiBiase the belt.  Oh, no.  Ted signs, and not, he doesn't sign the front where technically, you know, it's metal so  you can kind of wipe it away with Windex or something.  The back is felt.  Yeah.  So he signs the back, million dollar man Ted DiBiase.  It looks great.  Which is what I wanted. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  And then Eric's talking to Ted DiBiase about, you know, his favorite million dollar  man moments, and as he's talking, Virgil just takes the belt and signs the big V-I-R-G-I-L  on the back of that belt.  And he's like, here, I signed it for you, too.  And then he starts to charge me for it.  I'm like, I didn't ask you to sign it.  Oh, shit.  And charging you for it.  So you ruined it.  He wanted, like, now he doesn't have a million dollar title belt.  Signed by the million dollar man.  It's signed by the million dollar man. 
[00:33:30]  And Virgil.  Well, then he also said, he goes, now you have the only two people to wear the belt.  And I go, well, Steve Austin, but thanks.  Now you've got to get Steve Austin on it, though, so you can make it look like that's  what you meant to do.  Yeah, I know.  But even so, like, people...  We get him in.  Why didn't you bring it in when he was in?  I forgot.  You asshole.  People would want million dollar man and Stone Cold on the belt, though.  They still wouldn't want Virgil.  Not Virgil.  Oh, that's funny.  But at least you got him, so you could...  Again, you got a ballot.  There's no way to get Virgil off.  So you might as well get Stone Cold instead of forgetting it.  You've got to get Stone Cold.  Should have brought it in. 
[00:34:00]  That's your fault.  Virgil was famous, though.  He'd be like, what the hell's Virgil's name doing on this?  Were you annoyed when he signed it?  I'm fucking pissed off, because I didn't know he did it.  I'm talking...  Until he went to charge you money.  I'm talking with Ted DiBiase, and then he just kind of...  Like, I'm looking at Ted, and all of a sudden, from the right, the belt just kind of comes  into my vision as he's holding it.  He goes, I signed it for you.  Oh, is that great?  Virgil signing that belt would have the same effect of me writing my name on it as a joke.  That's like when Kramer started signing Jay Peterman's book at his book signing. 
[00:34:30]  That's like me getting something signed by Sabbath, and the bassist from Winger is there, and  he puts his name on it, too.  Look, you got me, too.  And like something good, like a guitar, or something that one of them used.  Yeah, it's stained.  Fuck.  That sucks.  Virgil's an ass.  He's just trying to make a bark.  But I saw that picture over the weekend, and I thought it was very funny.  I'm like, wow, you're still just trying to show this guy...  I like to speak back about how relentless I am. 
[00:35:00]  No, I was like, you're relentless with making this guy look like an asshole.  Well, what a set of balls he has coming.  Every six months, there's a wrestling convention on the East Coast, and he's at all of them.  He's at all of them.  And he doesn't even live on the East Coast.  And no one cares that he's there?  Nobody.  Look at the picture.  Anybody who wants a Virgil has a Virgil.  Yeah.  And no one wants one.  He's easy to get.  Yeah.  Now, what about...  Who was the guy you got?  Harley Race.  How long was the line for him?  It wasn't too long, because I got there late, so I just scooted at the end of the line.  But it was long in the beginning.  Don't you know enough people you can just go, could you bring me up there? 
[00:35:30]  I don't like doing that.  I love doing that.  I live to do that.  Well, you know, the line is part of it.  Listening to all the people talk, their recollections of these wrestlers.  I'm sure it's fascinating.  Yeah.  Would Bret Hart have remembered you?  Yeah, but he had such a long line.  I mean, my friend waited on the Bret Hart line.  And I said hello to him, but he was just going person, person, person, person.  Biggest superstar there.  Bret Hart by far, yeah.  Yeah?  I mean, it'd be hard to get any bigger than Bret.  Yeah.  Did he say hi to you?  Yeah, he said hello.  He remembered who I was from Comic-Con, but he didn't stop to chat. 
[00:36:00]  He had hours of lines of people.  Like Kaku remembers Jimmy.  Hi, Bret.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  Yeah, but he's not figuring out the universe, that Bret Hart.  That's true.  Not at all.  He's just thinking pen, sign, money.  It's a little slow these days.  I like Invent.  Where was that one?  This was right outside of Jersey in Pennsylvania.  It was like two hours away.  Oh, my God.  Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  You went all the way down there just to get Virgil's autograph. 
[00:36:30]  That's right.  I had to meet Virgil.  When's your New York Comic-Con coming?  There's a new one.  I think it's right around the corner.  A couple weeks, yeah.  Do you know when?  Yes.  When's the New Comic-Con?  Who want to go to it?  I went to that one.  Not much going on.  It's not as busy as the San Diego one.  No, no.  They're trying to boost it up a little bit.  It's definitely not like...  But is it good, though?  Who they got?  Who's coming?  There it is.  October 13th through 16th.  Let's see.  Who's coming?  Rose McGowan's going to be there.  Ooh.  All right.  She was at the last one, too.  Yeah, she was at San Diego. 
[00:37:00]  Ooh.  Well, let's see.  Who's going to be there?  Oh, it's not...  There it goes.  Okay.  Let's see.  Spotlight guests.  Go ahead.  We got...  Jason Mewes.  Oh, Frankie Mewes.  Wow.  Let me see.  Wow.  Mark Hamill.  Chad.  Hold on.  Chad Michael Murray?  Chad Michael Murray.  Who are these guys?  Chris Hardwick from G4, of course. 
[00:37:30]  Felicia.  Who's Felicia Day?  I don't know.  Who's mine kissing her?  I think she's, like, a nerd girl.  Judah Freelander.  Judah.  John Landis.  That's a big one.  Rose McGowan.  Jason Momo was the new Conan the Barbarian.  I'll get my picture, sir.  Yes.  Kevin Smith.  Kevin's a big one.  Mark Hamill.  Dude from Avatar that we had in.  Stephen Lang.  It's not that bad.  I wasn't here when he was in, was I?  He was really cool.  I want to get fucking...  I wouldn't mind getting Mark Hamill.  That's a pretty big one.  Whoa.  Diamond Dallas Page.  Who else we got?  Oh, Diamond Dallas Page. 
[00:38:00]  Well, that's huge.  Angry Bob's a comedian.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  Blair Butler?  Who the fuck is that?  I had no idea.  These are the ones they're advertising.  Oh, fuck.  Hey, that's the black guy from Battlestar Galactica.  Grizz from 30 Rock.  Who's, um...  Wait.  Who are these people?  Who's fucking this Aaron Cummings?  It's getting worse and worse.  It really is.  Ooh, she's pretty.  Oh, wow.  She's lovely.  She is pretty.  She is smoking.  I bet you that's an old picture, though.  She was on Star Trek Enterprise. 
[00:38:30]  Mad Men.  Spartacus.  Mad Men.  Ooh.  That cleavage is a little longer.  She is pretty.  Let's see who else.  You usually find one gem at the bottom of these.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy.  Kevin Sorbo.  Kevin Sorbo loves these things.  He's there all the time.  Luke Ferrigno is the Virgil of Comic-Con, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He's had a lot of these things.  Every single one.  Why?  He doesn't have to do that, does he?  Oh, there's chili.  Every single one.  It's not a convention if Luke Ferrigno's not there.  And Luke Ferrigno, of course, they're showing him as Hulk in the picture. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Just lest you forget.  Do they sign-  Cancellations.  Who canceled?  Virginia Hay and Kristen...  Harrison Ford and Jack Nicholson.  They should just do that.  Yeah.  Make it sound like they had some big names.  Well, there's some good names in there.  There's Star Wars people.  But in between the good names, there's a lot of nobodies.  A lot of shit.  A lot of shit.  But you're a shit sandwich.  How much is something signed by the majority of Star Wars people sell for?  Can we check?  Like, I'm curious. 
[00:39:30]  Like, there's got to be things signed by...  It's got to depend on what it is and who signed it.  Yeah.  Like, how much would the original Darth Vader...  No.  Just like a poster signed by them.  You can buy it.  An actual Star Wars original...  Yeah, I don't know how you know.  ...poster signed.  It's legit.  Go to price.  Go to, like...  Yeah, I know.  ...sort by price.  What else would you sort by?  Yeah.  Highest to lowest.  $10,900 for a limited frames.  Signed Lucas Limited Edition.  I don't know what that is.  Signed cast poster. 
[00:40:00]  There you go.  Four grand.  Oh, four grand.  Signed by the cast.  Ford Hamill Fisher.  That's pretty good.  That's like three.  Is it original, the poster?  Ford Hamill Fisher Mayhew.  $3,000.  That's not like a poster.  It's just a picture.  Is it?  Yeah.  Wow.  I should get this fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Lots of...  We had Mark Hamill in.  No, we had Carrie Fisher.  We had Carrie Fisher.  What was Mark in?  We had Mark in a long time ago.  Oh, years ago.  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah.  I should get something signed.  We absolutely had him in. 
[00:40:30]  Could you sign this?  Is that how you ask?  Yeah.  I really do.  And while they're talking, in the mid-conversation, I'll just put it under them.  Could you sign this?  You know how many of those people they get coming up to them every fucking day with the  stacks of pictures that they just want to sell on eBay?  I get them to me, though, so they don't mind.  Is your mic on?  It should be.  Went off again.  Did it?  Yeah.  I'm not doing that.  I hear you.  I can see it.  How long has it been off?  20 minutes?  No, but I heard you through Sam, maybe. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I heard you.  Oh, no.  The guest mic happened to be on, so you were totally on until you moved back.  I want...  There's a signed, ring-worn knee pad, signed by Virgil, for $66.  Is that the ones you're using when you're sucking Ted DiBiase's dick?  You get an autographed 8x10 for $7.99 on eBay.  $7.  Of course.  Until you buy it, and then it's like $12.  Of course.  You boost the price up.  I saw this one place when Big Kev was showing me around the one...  And there's reputable autograph dealers there, and you can usually tell... 
[00:41:30]  Whenever you see a baseball or something signed by Babe Ruth, and it's signed with a brand  new felt marker, it's a rip-off.  But there was one guy who had stuff signed by the Stooges.  Wow.  But they've written...  All those old autographs are in pen.  All three of them?  Yeah.  And I think a fourth one.  Fourth one?  Yes.  Ted the Stooges.  He's a sniper.  Quit hitting my eyes while I was hurting them.  It was...  But those old autographs are all in pen.  Like anything that's really...  Like old Beatles...  I've seen like old Lennon autographs. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, they just took a Bic.  A Bic, man.  They don't have these fancy...  When did the Sharpie come in to play with autographs?  But I hate when I see the blue Sharpie on something.  I never trust it.  I always think it's fake.  Why would you use a blue Sharpie?  I saw Babe...  I swear to God, I saw a baseball.  A Babe Ruth baseball signed in blue Sharpie.  It was in Vegas.  I'm like, who the fuck would think this is real?  Yeah.  It was like a few grand.  It was like nothing like it should have been.  Right.  Who would think this is real?  Everything was in black and white back then.  They never had blue.  Any Babe Ruth pen... 
[00:42:30]  A fucking baseball sign is just in a rotten little pen.  It's probably faded and the ball is dirty.  How many are left, do you think?  Like that's what a Babe Ruth...  God damn, how much is that?  That's the 1928 team...  Oh, man.  It's only 22,000?  No, it's not...  That couldn't be.  There's one...  You never know if these are authentic either.  Who's that?  Babe Ruth, look at the baseball.  It's pristine.  It looks like it just came out of the box.  Stop it.  Well, it might have been grand. 
[00:43:00]  Maybe it did.  60 G's.  That makes sense financially.  What's a letter of authenticity?  Any fucking asshole could make one of those up, including me.  Print that out.  Yeah, I know.  I want a photograph of Babe signing the ball.  Thank you, sweetie.  Yeah.  Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb signed the ball.  Get the fuck out of here.  How much?  40 G's.  40 grand.  Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb?  That would be fucking cool.  I would never believe that's real.  Yeah, you don't know.  Do you know which I would believe is real when I was in Yankee Stadium and they had team 
[00:43:30]  ball signed?  Those are real.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are not forged.  It's an authentic Ty Cobb because he always also dropped the N-bomb on there underneath.  Yeah.  Ty Cobb.  You know, I want to get a Ty Cobb jersey so bad.  Ever since I saw the movie Cobb, I wanted a fucking Ty Cobb because he was such a cunt.  He was a bastard.  I want a Ty Cobb.  How much is a Ty Cobb ball?  There couldn't be a real one on eBay.  No way.  If you're buying fucking sports memorabilia for 60 grand on eBay, you're an idiot. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  We'd have to go to a private deal or something.  $1,500?  That's impossible.  Look at the ball.  How fucking real does that look?  I mean, maybe it is, but...  It doesn't look very real to me.  I don't know.  It's dated.  January 23rd, 1950.  1950.  Could you date this so in the future when there's something called eBay, I could put it up on  there and another letter of authenticity?  It's the same people.  It's a letter of grading and authenticity. 
[00:44:30]  Okay, so they grade the ball and the signature and, well, that's bullshit.  Yeah.  I want to buy something that's original and signed.  I'm afraid to start collecting autographs that I don't get because I don't need another  fucking financial thing to fall into.  Like another hobby.  My hobby is cheap.  My obsession is cheap.  It is.  You take the pictures yourself.  You just go to the printer.  You haven't blown up.  And you're lucky enough to watch these guys sign them.  Yeah, I'm right there.  So why would you go the other way and start buying shit you don't know if it's real or 
[00:45:00]  not?  Like comic books.  I collected comic books years ago.  I can't imagine getting back into that.  You know, I need the Ninja Comics number 378.  Yeah.  That's the one where the cover art was slightly off and it's worth.  Yeah.  If you look, if you look, thing has two left hands.  Does he?  30,000.  All right.  We should take our first break.  Oh, good.  My sandwich is still hot.  Mine is too.  I couldn't eat eggs again.  We have no guests today, huh?  No, tomorrow we have a couple of good ones, though. 
[00:45:30]  Who do we got tomorrow?  Sebastian Bach and Michael K. Williams.  Omar.  Fucking Omar.  From The Wire.  Of course, he's in Boardwalk Empire and Community soon, right?  Yeah, I didn't know Boardwalk Empire started last night.  Last night.  And I'm doing something tonight if you want to go.  I just found out that...  We going to the play?  Yeah, John Amos' play is at 115 McDougal tonight at 830 at the Players Theater.  They added a couple of shows.  I guess our last interview helped.  Fuck.  So, I want to go to that.  It's 830 tonight.  Right next door to the Comedy Cellar. 
[00:46:00]  I'll go.  Yeah.  I'm dying to see this.  Me and Jimmy will go.  Yes, we will.  We'll check that shit out.  Like a couple.  Just me and you.  No girls.  Just me and you.  We'll go as friends.  Yeah.  You guys are going to a lot of shows.  Why not?  Look at you.  A couple of men sitting there watching a play.  It's dark.  We'll go as friends.  Go see wiki, you two fruits.  You almost said wiki.  I said wiki.  We did go see Book of Mormon together.  That was the last time me and Jimmy hung out.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was nice.  It was a great day out.  Nice little show.  I want to see it again. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I got audio being kicked out of a $60 a night hotel if you want to hear that after the break.  Yeah.  Boy, your big weekend with Robert Kelly.  Fantastic.  Yeah, we did match the hatch, too, this weekend.  Oh, man.  In Roscoe, New York.  Roscoe, New York.  And the whole week.  I don't want to go there.  No.  There's no reason to go there unless you go fly fishing.  Of course not.  But you get on the river, you're like, holy fuck, this is Americana.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing. 
[00:47:00]  Amazing nature.  No fucking houses or nothing around there.  Can't you just go down that river here on Long Island?  That's a shitty river.  I mean, that's a clog.  That's a shitty river.  Have you ever done that river?  I did some canoeing down that river once.  That's not nature.  You got to get up into the Catskills for nature.  Yeah.  I learned a lot, though, dude.  Sullivan County, where Roscoe, New York is.  Yeah.  67% of the people on government assistance.  Really?  67%.  There's no industry up there whatsoever. 
[00:47:30]  It's beautiful up there, but they don't know how to fucking make money.  Yeah, I've been up there.  It's crazy.  And if you don't do fly fishing, there's no reason to be where I was.  So I'm looking around at these people like, why are you even here?  Go somewhere else.  I'll leave.  It's nice and all, but there's nothing there.  I was on HDNet, by the way, before we go.  I was watching last moments of John Fogarty's concert.  I didn't really want to see him live.  Fogarty is good, man.  Fuck, man.  He's good.  God, did he sound great.  A lot of hits.  And one of the greatest stories ever.  He had to sue himself. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, he actually had to sue himself or something.  Did he?  Yeah, one of his companies had to sue his other company to get rights to music.  It got very confusing.  Yeah.  But he had to sue himself to get himself out of a jam or something.  Maybe we can get that story for after the break.  I haven't thought about that in years.  But yeah, a little audio from me and Bobby going at it with this woman that runs a $60  a night shit motel.  One star, right?  A one star motel, yeah.  There's a brave staying there.  I would never stay in a one star. 
[00:48:30]  We didn't stay there.  We tried to.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I'll explain next.  The audio absolutely is pretty good.  And we'll do that next either.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  What's up, baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like.  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue and it'll lick all  the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start flicking it all over your nipples  so much that you start cumming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down there and just start licking your fucking cooter really good. 
[00:49:30]  I'll just, I'll open up your cooter.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cooter lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like.  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're a building or something.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you. 
[00:50:00]  I'm going to put a finger in my ass.  And now another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Listen to this one.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel, gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera and he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go.  He has to go now.  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  So I go there. 
[00:50:30]  I open the door.  I'm going to open the door.  There's shit on my fingers.  So I'm like, what is this?  So I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  And it's fresh.  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in a wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it.  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking.  And I look at him.  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts. 
[00:51:00]  I finally get up upstairs and I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs, where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have fell out of his shorts.  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  It's just there's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people are just staring at me going, I can't believe someone let their dog just defecate on the sidewalk.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.

[00:52:00]  Nirvana's Nevermind came out.  And I guess Sirius XM did a big special this weekend.  Yes.  Jon Stewart hosted it?  Yeah, I was up here because it was on Saturday night and it was insane.  But why Jon Stewart?  He's a big Nirvana fan?  Or once again, is the company looking for a big name?  Well, I guess he must be a Nirvana fan and he was...  I would bet money's not a fucking Nirvana fan. 
[00:52:30]  For him to do it on a Saturday night?  I've never heard of him ever talk about Nirvana over the years.  He's hip with the demo.  And wasn't he in one of those movies in the 90s too?  A bunch of them.  He was with that Janine Garofalo crew.  Yeah, name one movie Jon Stewart was in.  I'll give you $100 right on the spot.  Don't fucking look down.  Oh, shit.  Time's up.  He was in Red Dawn.  Was he really?  No, I just wanted to share my happy chops.  Oh, my God.  You got me that time. 
[00:53:00]  So, uh...  Faculty.  Big Daddy.  Did you meet him?  No, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  There were a lot of people here.  You weren't allowed to meet Nirvana, were you?  Be honest.  Nirvana or Jon?  Neither one.  They were here?  And it's not Nirvana without Kurt Cobain.  I know Dave Grohl is a massive fucking rock star now, but...  Chris Novoselic and Butch Vig were all here being interviewed by Jon Stewart.  Oh, Butch Vig would be pretty cool to meet.  In the fishbowl.  I didn't realize that.  They had 40 fans up, and then, I mean, a ton of people who work here were here. 
[00:53:30]  All the bosses were here, up here.  Springsteen?  Springsteen himself, no.  Was Scott here?  I didn't see him.  That's a pretty big one for Jon and...  Crime family heads?  I mean, yeah, we saw Blatter.  He was up here.  Oh, okay.  A lot of people were up here, but, uh...  Yeah, there was a big to-do.  There was a very...  It was...  Was there a Nirvana channel?  There was.  I don't know if it's still on.  Is it over ready?  It might still be on, but it's...  Lithium turned into Nirvana channel.  But it was...  I... 
[00:54:00]  It's the biggest deal I've ever seen them make out of anything.  They made a bigger deal out of this than they did when Oprah was up here.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  By the way, to answer your question, that might have been...  Maybe...  Maybe Jon Stewart...  Maybe there's a mutual liking, and they knew that they could get these guys if they had  Jon in a group.  All right, that's a real answer, at least.  I'm guessing, because sometimes these guys...  It's hard to get these guys probably together.  So maybe they're like, get the fuck out of here, and then they got Jon Stewart to work  as magic.  Would you like a picture with those guys, the three remaining guys in Nirvana?  I got a picture with Grohl.  Nova Selleck would be cool.  I guess.  I got Grohl licking my head. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Without Kurt Cobain, that's one of those bands.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's a little rough.  But, I mean, Grohl's...  That picture alone.  Yeah, but I got his picture.  I got to be like, hey, Nova Selleck, get out of the fucking way.  Whoever the fuck you are.  Hey, Virgil, get out of here.  You leave.  Virgil.  Yeah.  They should have just...  You know what they should have done?  What?  Hung a guitar over his chair, and then at one point just cut the lines and let the guitar  hit him on the head like the good old days.  Did you, Grohl, did you see Dave Grohl and those guys playing to the Westboro Church on  the back of a flatbed? 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  It was great.  Yes.  That's pretty good.  Yes.  They just stopped the flatbed truck and played at them, and nobody...  It was the Foo Fighters.  Right.  And nobody was looking at the Westboro people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a great way to do it.  Grohl's great.  He's a rock star, that motherfucker.  He really is.  Westboro Church, I think, is becoming a joke at this point.  Oh, well, yeah.  Yeah, it's...  They're really getting beat up pretty good from the other side now, finally.  Whatever.  Yeah, this is...  Foo Fighters sing to Westboro.  In counter-protest. 
[00:55:30]  They just stopped on a flatbed where they're protesting and started playing.  And just jamming.  And there's probably traffic behind them, but by the time the cops can move you, you just  drive away.  Yeah.  And I would bet the cops take their time moving Dave Grohl and the boys out of the way.  Westboro Baptist Church.  Oh, wait, they were going to picket the Foo Fighters, or this is...  Which first?  Honestly, I don't know the backstory on this one, Jimmy. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  I really don't know.  On August 30th, Westboro Church called for a picket of the Foo Fighters.  In Kansas City, yeah.  They're just a little...  Were they running out of ideas?  They're just attention whores at this point?  They're running out of shocking people.  Oh, so the Foo Fighters played to annoy them, I see.  Yeah, what could be the problem with the Foo Fighters?  Does anyone know?  Anyone know more about this?  They don't like that rock music.  No, they don't like that music.  But why the Foo Fighters?  Something that probably promotes the gay lifestyle.  Foo Fighters promote the gay lifestyle?  I would assume. 
[00:56:30]  It says, God hates gays.  Okay.  Keep God's laws for fags, or what?  Oh, who cares?  Thank God for dead soldiers.  They remind me of little children yelling out their kitchen screen door, like offensive  things.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, if God is looking out for you so much, why do you use police protection?  Why do you obey ordinances?  Silly.  That's ridiculous.  Putting on their facial hair.  Yeah.  Good for fucking Dave Grohl and the guy.  So it was a big night here Saturday? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, and I think it was a pretty big success, too.  Everybody loved it.  Good.  Good for...  It seemed like the guys in the band had a good time.  Jon Stewart had a good time.  Right.  They went the whole...  How long was it?  The deal was, it was like, here's 20 questions to ask, you have to ask all 20 questions, but  it could go anywhere from half an hour to two hours, whatever, like depending on the  conversation, and they figured it'd go an hour, an hour 15, and it went past two hours.  Like, at 10 o'clock, I was out there after my show, and they were still going.  Oh, wow.  Mm-hmm.  You should have walked over and started talking to them. 
[00:57:30]  Just kind of go into the fishbowl and say, what are you guys still doing here?  Yeah.  No, why not?  Why not, man?  There were security measures in place.  All the security guards were here.  Really?  You know, Master Joe, all the guys.  It was a massive deal.  Yeah, I guess the fucking three members, or two Survivor members of Nirvana, John Stewart's  a big deal, too.  Well, it's the 20th anniversary, never mind, so it is a big deal, music.  All elements brought together.  Yes.  I tweeted the...  And people killed Sirius for this, but it's like, they tried to do the right thing, 
[00:58:00]  but they Twittered, Sirius blocked out the baby's penis or whatever in the ad or something  for the...  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, and it was like, someone tweeted that to me, and it was like, I get why they think  they're being the right, but it's like, it's not pornographic.  I don't get it, but I don't get it at all.  It's just a naked baby.  Yeah, leave it the fuck alone.  This is satellite...  Ah, whatever.  And it's been part of...  Well, it was for an ad showed somewhere.  It's part of fucking...  It's part of history.  History.  It was in record stores.  It was all over the place.  Dominantly displayed.  When it was first out, no one really had a problem with it, so why, 20 years later, 
[00:58:30]  you're starting to...  You're making a problem that's not there.  I love that cover.  The fucking Blind Faith cover is basically an 11-year-old naked on their album.  Oh, the Blind Faith one with the topless chick?  Yeah.  They were supposed to get her older sister to do it?  And she wasn't available, so...  Or the parents got upset or something, so then they wound up getting the younger sister.  I believe you're right. 
[00:59:00]  And she's like this fucking ugly kid with her little budding boobies on the cover of  Blind Faith, and that never...  I don't think that ever got any shit for being a kiddie porn or anything.  And that was a big album when it first came out, so...  If it's not sexually suggestive, naked children are not...  But she's holding a hood ornament or something.  Oh, I don't know what she's doing.  An airplane, I think, right?  It's like some kind of an airplane thing.  A little model airplane, what?  The town hall is going to re-air today at 3 o'clock on Channel 34. 
[00:59:30]  The Nirvana thing.  What?  The Nirvana thing that we were just discussing.  Oh, okay.  Jon Stewart interviewing the...  Why are you promoting SiriusXM?  They don't promote us.  Yeah?  What's wrong with you?  Well, because I figure...  Can you listen online?  Not right now, Anthony.  The feed won't go out?  Okay, never mind.  Radio might work.  I don't know.  When they start promoting us, we'll promote the other shit they do around.  Fair enough.  I just thought our listeners might want to...  They'll figure it out on their own.  Okay.  If they're Nirvana fans, they'll figure it out.  By the way, our online feed is down.  Oh.  If anybody wants to look into that.  At least it never happens, though. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And you don't have to tweet me 80 times to tell me that, asshole.  Blocked.  Asshole.  Hey, so over the weekend, I went to Roscoe, New York, to do a little fly fishing.  How'd that work out for you?  I had...  I'm getting abused, but I had a great time.  Why are you getting abused?  I called one fish.  Because it was me and Bobby just, I guess, you know, just in the wilderness together.  In the woods.  I called one fish?  One fish.  I heard...  One fish after 10 hours.  I read a tweet from Jay Moore, and he said, you two should go in the woods and suck each 
[01:00:30]  other's dicks or something.  Yeah.  Like, he just decided it was good to just tweet, hey, you and Bobby get in the woods  and suck each other's dicks.  Yeah.  Only gay guys think that much about other guys, so...  If that's your fantasy, Jay, all right.  Jay has some fantasy there.  Sorry we couldn't do that for you.  Yeah.  I think it's a fair thing to want, though.  You just put it.  You guys.  You just blow each other.  Men.  Men.  Got juniper berries on your knees.  Juniper. 
[01:01:00]  I want to thank the Baxter House, and I want to thank Twitter.  One of these guys.  Thank you.  No problem.  Anytime.  One of these guys got a hold of me and Bobby and said, what you guys did last time is  bullshit.  Let me show you a real experience.  The real deal?  So we got on a little fly fishing boat.  I don't know what they're called.  It's kind of like a fly fishing boat.  Is it?  I guess.  You're probably right.  With a comfy seat, and then we went down the river 16 fucking miles all day long. 
[01:01:30]  16 miles?  On a river.  Down a river?  And this poor guy, Rich, who was our guide, had to fucking row the whole time.  It's a row boat?  Yeah, but it's slow current.  But he still had to row his ass off the entire day.  Had to get back.  And then the fucking car is waiting for us at the end.  Nice.  Put it there.  Some dude.  I don't know.  How'd you get back to the other place?  Then we rode back in the car.  Isn't someone stuck walking?  No.  The guy that brings the car.  I'm sure he has a friend that brings another car.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  So they drop us off.  And then that same truck that put the boat in the water and stuff is 16 miles down river  for us.  Just waiting for you.  Just waiting for us.  Beautiful.  All those fish.  Fish.  And I caught one.  So I win.  I win.  Bobby didn't catch any fish?  Zero.  He claims that he had one on the line, but none of us saw it.  I felt the nibble, dude.  I went to set the hook.  But for the people that know fly fishing.  My coffee. 
[01:02:30]  I did something that was absolutely fucking impossible if you know fly fishing.  I was dragging my line in the water to walk to a spot so we could do some fly fishing.  We got off the boat for a little while.  Yeah.  And as I'm dragging my line through the water, I caught a fish, a rainbow trout.  That's impossible.  These are finicky motherfuckers.  What?  Did you catch Walter?  I caught Walter.  Big old son of a bitch.  I caught Walter.  How much line did you have out when you were dragging the pole? 
[01:03:00]  10 feet, I guess.  Whatever.  So 10 feet behind you.  Yeah, I was just dragging.  You're just dragging it.  And I'm in water up to my knees.  So I thought, ah, fuck.  I got it on the rocks.  I got to, like, unsnag this bitch.  And you're going against the current.  Against the current, which is impossible.  Because if that fly isn't moving the exact same way as the current, these fish won't touch it.  Really?  They just kind of know it's fake.  For the most part, yeah.  It's in their DNA or something.  I don't fucking know.  How do they see a fly in the water?  I don't know, Jimmy.  Fuck.  I guess they have good eyesight.  That's food.  They'll probably look at you and go, how does they see a steak on a plate? 
[01:03:30]  So wait, the, um, the, uh.  That's what they eat.  You just move the thing.  A-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  And they see it bouncing off the water.  You go, I got one.  This sounds awful.  Yeah, but the other boat we went with, they were, like, a little ahead of us.  They were catching fish left and right.  But that's how much we suck at fly fishing.  And they were catching what's called pigs.  They're big-ass motherfuckers.  You were hanging out with one.  Yeah.  I should have thrown Bobby in the water to try to hook him.  And they were getting, like, five, six, seven-pound fucking browns. 
[01:04:00]  How many did Bobby catch?  Zero.  Oh, he caught none and you caught one?  Yeah, and mine was a mistake.  It's funny.  We fucking sucked.  Eight hours.  You weren't even technically fishing when you got that fish.  No, and the guy's like, you don't have to tell anyone.  I'm like, no, that's the beauty of this story that I caught one by accident.  What, the guy sucked?  What was he telling you to do wrong?  No, Rich was good.  But the problem was, if you really want to get into it, the water of the river is way too high. 
[01:04:30]  And so these fish don't want to use all that energy to feed.  So they just camp out until the water goes back down.  So what you're trying to do is go to the banks, you know, because they're pushed up against the side.  So they don't have to deal with the current as much.  And you're hoping they'll feed anyway.  And the other boat was having some luck doing just that.  They caught about seven total, I think.  And Bobby was saying what?  Like, yeah, dude, what's match the hatch mean?  When you look around at the bugs, I know way too much about fly fishing.  It's not going to become a hobby, though. 
[01:05:00]  I'll go every once in a while.  Look at the bugs in the air and stuff and see what's kind of landing on the water.  And then you match it with all your shitty homemade flies you got.  Your little lure has to look like what's in the actual atmosphere.  Oh, fuck them.  You would never do this, would you?  Never.  Not unless there were giant clits being fucking caught.  And you couldn't take up fishing.  You didn't fish.  You basically, you guys just hung out on the water, which is very nice.  That I would enjoy.  I liked it because we saw a couple eagles and all sorts of shit. 
[01:05:30]  So a muskrat.  Birdie.  Michael Vick.  I hope he's okay, by the way.  He went down.  But my fucking hand hurts.  My arm is like, we cast it all fucking day.  Who loves to fish?  You don't like fishing?  Have you ever done it?  Yes.  And have you fished?  Years ago.  With your dad.  We talked about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill D'Angelo and his father caught a lot of fish, and I caught none.  And my dad, I told you, we had the fucking Chevy Vega.  Yeah.  And he had a big dumb bass sticker on the back, and he told me, that's to let people know there's 
[01:06:00]  a fisherman on board.  Did he have a Go Fishing bumper sticker, Till?  No.  Or Gone Fishing is the famous one, right?  Gone Fishing.  Gone Fishing.  Just a leaping fish.  Oh, that's horrible.  To let everybody know there was a fisherman on board.  A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work.  Yeah, I, uh...  God, you're both sinks.  I know, because it's not a bad day fishing.  I mean, you get a hook in the eye, or you're pissing and you're urinating on a yellow jacket  next to me, I'll sting your cockhole. 
[01:06:30]  I'll take a good day at work.  Or have my cockhole stung by bees.  I like fishing.  I really do.  And this fly fishing is kind of interesting, you know, because it's different.  Do you relax when you fish?  Yeah, man.  Bobby gets all tense, because he's like, he's trying to forget shit, I think.  He's intense about everything.  I think he's trying to forget shit when he's fishing.  I'm just out there going, this is kind of cool.  I'm looking around, you know, trying it out a little bit, but I don't need to catch anything.  Why are you holding it with two hands?  What the fuck is this?  What?  There's two hands. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, you got...  He's letting the line out.  Get the fuck out of here.  Or in our case, we were kind of like, we were, what is it called?  Stripping, I guess.  Oh.  You land...  They're called kittens.  They're bigger flies, much bigger.  Throw it near the bank, and then you strip the line three times quickly.  Make him believe it.  You got to make it look like a fish, and hopefully they buy into that and jump on it.  How about you just leave a worm there and say, grab this.  They don't like worms.  What?  Or maybe they do.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck these fucking trout like. 
[01:07:30]  I know they like flies.  Yeah.  I don't know what else they like.  So basically, there's no food on there.  It's just a fake fly?  It's just like a feather wrapped around a single bead for a head, and they make their  little lures, and then it's supposed to resemble a bug.  A fly looks almost like a piece of lint on your shirt.  And you look at it like, how the fuck are they going to see this?  But they do.  How about you get a real fly and just put it in a bubble?  How about you get a piece of plastic with a real fly in it, and you throw it in there,  and they go to bite them. 
[01:08:00]  You club them.  But, yeah, you catch some big fucking fish.  That guy's pretty happy with himself right there.  He has a helicopter in the background.  I wonder where he is.  Yeah, he's probably way the fuck in the wilderness, obviously.  Copster in to that place, exactly.  Well, we only saw one boat all fucking day, man.  And no assholes.  Because they knew there was shitty fishing there.  No assholes.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the fishing capital of the world, basically.  As far as trout go.  Where's the best place to go fly fishing?  Trout Town, USA.  I think there were better hotels, then. 
[01:08:30]  No kidding.  The best place to go trout fishing is Roscoe, New York, believe it or not.  No way.  Really?  And Montana.  Montana.  A river runs through it?  And they argue.  I mean, Montana's a better time because there's other shit to do up there.  Really?  They argue that the Roscoe area is actually much better, but Montana has a lot more rivers  in general.  So they argue that shit all the time.  Oh, God.  I wish I would enjoy that outdoors.  Ted Williams, I heard, used to love to fish.  You wouldn't just hang out on a boat and go down the river all day? 
[01:09:00]  I'd fucking sooner hang out in a bear trap.  Really?  Yeah.  Never.  I'd have to shit.  As soon as the boat pulled away, I'd have to shit.  You couldn't relax that long?  It would depend on who I was with.  I mean...  We laughed our balls off because we're just idiots.  Yeah.  My friends, I could do something like that.  But I just...  Fishing, for me, was always a place where I had to take a wicked shit and couldn't.  I caught nothing, and I hate the fucking smell of worms and fish.  I don't like to kill them.  I feel guilty. 
[01:09:30]  Let's go fishing this weekend.  Let's go find a charter.  I'll be in Tampa at the Improv.  Oh.  Thank you.  Well, let's go fishing between shows.  I'll fly down to Tampa.  We'll do some fishing.  I'll be getting some good fishing down there.  They'd probably go for marlin and all that shit.  That's like the deep sea fishing.  Yeah, I want to do some of that, which is the opposite of this fly fishing.  Big fucking fish up, and their eyeballs pop out of their head because they're  used to 8 billion pounds per square inch being on top of them.  But, yeah, like the deep ones, when you pull them up, the pressure, or the lack  thereof, when they come up, their body, like, expands, and their eyes pop out of 
[01:10:00]  their head, and they're like, wow, they look like Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.  I thought I explained Match the Hatch, but Bill in Chicago wants to explain it  properly, I guess.  Oh, wow.  Fuck you, running.  Go ahead, Bill.  I'm telling you, there's three major lines.  You got your streamers, which you do like what, uh, overstands it.  You strip the line, you pull them in, you drive lines, which you pull it on top.  This is the worst sound I've ever heard.  I know, I know.  I don't know if it's your phone or your stupid Chicago accent or your voice.  It's what he's saying, it's how he's saying it, it's his voice, it's his phone. 
[01:10:30]  Everything about your call is horrid.  He is right.  There's something called dry flies.  That's what Ant was talking about, where you make the flies that look almost as  small as length, and you drop them on the water so that, you know, they stay  pretty much dry and float.  Surface tension keeps them up.  Float along with the stream or the river.  Yes, he's right.  And then what we were doing, we were getting them wet, letting them sink and, and, and  then stripping the line to make it look like it's a bigger fish.  A whitebill?  And what's the third one?  And the third one is the nymph.  Dynamite.  When the bug before it turns into an insect and flies, it hatches on the bottom and floats 
[01:11:00]  up.  Yeah, we did some nymph fishing too.  He's right.  All right.  I didn't think I had explained it that deeply for everyone.  I just was given basics.  Are you a fly fisherman, Bill?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, I've been out west in Maine.  Is that good fishing up there?  Yeah, I can go out and probably catch 30 or 40 in two hours.  Wow.  What's the...  Any day in the week you want to go, I'll show you where to catch fish.  You should catch them up and right.  What's the best place in the world or in the country just to sit there and fish on 
[01:11:30]  a lake and catch big 20-pounders?  Yeah, it all depends on what you're going for.  Yeah.  If it's in streams, it all depends on the current flow.  Like you said, the water's too high right now, so it's hard to fish.  The water's too high.  Way too high.  Yeah, there's a whole...  Can't swim?  There's a whole...  They're fish.  They can, but all that water's pushing up against them, so they realize they're going  to use too much energy to go and get that, so they're like, why bother?  They don't realize anything.  They're dumb fish.  I don't know, and that dumb fish brain, they got some shit in there that figures it out. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Hey, Bill, Roscoe, New York is a good place to fish, though, right?  Yeah, anywhere up through the...  The cab fills up, you know, all the way up through there.  They got to run out, all that.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  So anyway, we go up to Roscoe, New York to check into our motel, our shitty motel that  we stayed at last time, and we want to go back there.  It's tradition.  It's $60 a night.  Tradition.  You did it once.  Yeah, that's right.  That tradition, you make it seem like you'll see you the same time next year with Ellen 
[01:12:30]  Burson and Ellen Alda.  I guess you're right, but we started, we were trying to start the tradition by going back  there.  How's that?  $60 a night, Roscoe Motel, fucking one star motel online.  And we show up, and we show up, and I pop my camera on, and the lady goes, why are you  filming me?  And then that clicks something in her brain.  She goes, wait a minute.  You're the guy with those videos.  Uh-oh.  With your listeners that left all those horrible comments. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, shit.  And I go, I wish Bobby was here.  I go, I don't know what you're talking about.  She goes, oh, yeah?  She goes to her computer.  She's been waiting for us to come back.  We haven't been there in two years.  She clicked one fucking thing on her computer, and my face comes up on her computer, big  as day, with this look like, look at this shitty room I'm in.  It's not me.  Oh, yeah, wait.  Maybe it is.  And then she goes, let me find the video so we can read the comments.  I'm like, I don't need to look at the videos.  I made them.  I know what I said.  We were just trying to have fun.  So I got the video. 
[01:13:30]  I got the audio from the video we shot.  It's not good.  She didn't understand fun?  Ah, you know, they were Indians.  Oh, really?  Do Indians in general understand humor?  Let's be honest with each other.  I literally know very, I mean, there's Aziz and a couple other.  I know very funny, very few funny Indian people.  Aziz confuses everybody, because in general, they just don't seem, in my opinion, to have  a sense of humor.  Very few.  Because we were trying to explain, look, it was all in fun.  Look, we're coming back, so obviously we like your place on some level. 
[01:14:00]  One star.  Shut up.  One star.  No cars in the parking lot.  And it's a $60 a night place, and she refused to let us stay there.  Wow.  And we got the audio as we were going back and forth.  So, all right, so there was a bad video.  What do you say about the video?  No, she doesn't like us.  No, it's not about liking you or not, because I got comments on the videos, too.  What did they say about the video?  You were on the video.  What?  I don't think you were on the video.  I was not on the video, but my place was on a video. 
[01:14:30]  What did it say, though?  I'm going to show you.  Was it good or bad?  It was bad.  What did he say?  I was bad about...  What happened?  Well, I'm just wondering...  Who is that?  That's not...  Yeah.  That's him, yeah.  So that's when she popped up my picture.  Yeah, yeah.  She was fucking pissed.  She's been waiting for this for two years.  Oh, she's been waiting.  Right.  Yeah, that's good.  That's him.  Wait, you took my picture?  What's wrong about her?  I didn't take your picture.  Ryan Roscoe standing in the room.  Wait, you got my picture on your computer.  Worst motel room ever. 
[01:15:00]  It was a bad hotel room.  Okay.  No, but no, but it was...  There was a big mosquito on, I bet.  Can you know why, though?  Mosquito, that's not...  No, can I say why?  Because he's a very rich person, and he's used to spaying in luxury hotels.  So I brought him to...  Stupid Bobby, by the way, he doesn't...  He can't handle uncomfortableness.  Really?  Yeah, so he's actually trying to explain it...  Oh, is he?  ...in a real way at first.  And then I'm looking, I'm like, let's just fucking have fun with this lady.  We're obviously not staying here anymore.  Was she pretty or no? 
[01:15:30]  She was all right.  She sounds kind of pretty.  She was all right.  ...fish for the first time.  So you're taking it out of context.  So when a rich person comes here, okay, you have to admit that this place isn't the Four Seasons.  So when a guy like this comes here, he's like, this stinks.  It's not what I'm used to.  It's like, yeah, dude, this is fishing.  This is Roscoe.  This is the way you do it here.  You don't get the five-star treatment.  This hotel is a regular hotel.  To him, it's like, holy shit.  You know what I mean?  But to people who stay here, you know, it's a hotel room. 
[01:16:00]  It's a room.  You come in here to spend the night.  I usually do five-star hotels.  I could buy this whole thing and turn it into a parking lot.  That's why.  I'm sorry I insulted you.  Right.  I can buy this whole thing.  Threatening to buy the place and turn it into a parking lot.  Right.  Well, because I know we're not staying there, so I'm like, oh, let's fucking try to get  something out.  Yeah, completely blow it up.  Let's just blow up our spot now.  But Bobby's still hoping that we could stay there, because I guess he has memories from  last time.  You ruined his fucking whole gig with going up there and staying at the hotel. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, and I'm thinking, we'll find a place to stay.  Fuck this place.  Because now it's guilt by association.  Of course.  They won't let him stay there either now.  This is where she refuses to give us the room.  Yeah.  I want to find it.  I want to see the video.  What did he say in the video?  No.  Was it bad?  I don't want to know what I said in the video.  Why?  I just want to check into my room.  Our security people will be here in an hour, walking the perimeter to make sure we're okay. 
[01:17:00]  What?  I just want to be in my room.  What?  I just want to be in my room.  Do you not want to stay here?  She doesn't want us here, Bobby.  Listen, it's not that I don't.  It's obvious.  See, Bobby's like, he's hoping we can work this out.  Yeah, yeah.  And now I'm thinking, she fucking hates us, right?  Yeah.  The family hates us.  It's a family business.  So I'm thinking, logically here, like if we do stay here, we're in the middle of nowhere  and it gets really fucking dark at night and all of a sudden they're going to start chattering  like, remember those two guys with the videos?  Well, they're in room three and four right now. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  And I'm thinking I'm going to get someone knocking on my door in the middle of the night.  Fucking beating.  And Bobby doesn't understand it on that level.  I'm like, if she's mad at us, there's no fucking way we could stay here.  This could just end horribly bad.  Turn into a motel hell situation.  Yeah.  Right.  Dear Bob.  Listen, it's not that I don't want...  It's obvious she doesn't want us here.  We had fun with the little video and she's insulted.  I am...  Listen, I was offended the way...  You're extremely insulted.  ...the way you guys worded, the way the videos...  You guys?  ...the way the people commented that video. 
[01:18:00]  You guys?  Even that picture.  Well, do you understand...  But I'm not in the picture.  But do you understand what we're looking at?  This is a shithole.  It's not...  But I'm not in the picture.  This is a shithole.  That's fine.  The people that own a business don't want to hear that it's a shithole.  And then Bobby's like now trying to separate himself from the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, I swear.  I don't care.  Right.  What we're looking at, this is a shithole.  It's not...  But I'm not in the picture.  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm not going to give you a room because you just called my place a shithole. 
[01:18:30]  Why'd you do that?  What is it?  It's too far.  That's too far.  Well, I'm sorry.  That's too far.  I'm going to cancel your reservation.  That's too far, Bobby.  That's just...  It's not a shithole.  I just got mad because you got mad.  I'm not mad.  I'm not mad.  I'm just telling you what's out there and what happened because of your video.  That's what I'm saying.  It's good to know someone's watching my stupid video.  It is.  First time, I was amazed.  I'm like, wow, maybe people are watching these stupid things.  That's very funny.  And then she finally found the video. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And this is the best part because the listeners just...  In the comments killed this fucking place.  Oh, is that it?  And once again, she doesn't understand humor on any level.  So she's taking it as real serious comments.  And she wanted us to read the comments out loud so we could see it her way.  Oh, boy.  You got a lot of business.  That's not a good idea.  Excuse me?  You got a lot of business?  No.  Did you see that?  Would you like to go through each comment?  Yeah, go through a couple comments.  Let me read a couple.  Yeah, read a couple.  What does it say?  Let me zoom in so you guys can see.  All right.  Let's zoom in and see what we got. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  So what is it?  Will you be sleeping naked to keep your undies fresh?  Linger longer.  So what's wrong with that?  See, but she's bothered by even that.  Let's go for, you know, you guys.  Of course.  Where's your boyfriend, Bob?  That's me.  Could you have been with aunt?  Best check the bed for messy male protein stains before sleeping in.  That's not good.  That's funny.  That could be any.  She was smirking.  You were laughing at that one. 
[01:20:00]  You laughed at that one.  That was pretty funny.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Shit the room I paid.  Okay.  Don't let the bed bugs bite.  Well, that's a joke.  That's a joke.  Okay.  Don't go to bed.  Even the nicest hotels in New York.  Yeah, my grandmother said that to me.  People joke about bed bugs.  At her own house.  Yeah.  Okay.  Five bucks says there are roaches somewhere in the bathroom.  Don't worry.  You should go drink with the locals.  And maybe Bubba would let you sleep in his log cabin.  See, that's funny.  That's a rape joke.  It's like, I would get raped by Bubba.  But not at your finest hotel. 
[01:20:30]  Wait, but another.  Where's another one?  Where's another one?  Yeah.  I think we're.  Who pushed, who pushed button's phone?  Not a, oh, wow.  A push button phone.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Yeah, that's kind of it.  You know that.  Call it the bed bug.  Good luck.  Like, come on.  Well, bed bugs is just.  That's a joke.  That's a hack motel joke.  That's a hack motel joke.  We know that.  We know that.  How many stars does your motel get?  One star.  Why do you get only one star?  Because people.  I don't know.  Because I'm not.  Oh, boy.  One star.  Motel. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  We're going to go.  I like her, though.  One star.  Oh, boy.  I kind of like her.  She's just defeated.  Like, ugh.  She knows she's working in a show.  Yeah, she goes.  How many stars?  She's like, one star.  One star.  Why one star?  I don't know.  Because they do take pride in the place.  One star means a shithole, by the way.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  Are we going to work?  And then we see if we can work it out.  Because now we're feeling like she might be seen in our way a little bit.  One star, by the way.  But I was not going to stay here no matter what.  No.  One star means the toilet paper has broken glass taped to it. 
[01:21:30]  What does it mean to have a one star hotel, you think?  Five star means that.  Because the place doesn't look like a one star.  Well, it's all amenities, too.  Like, a five star means, I think, that they have cloth napkin.  And a cloth, like, face towels in all the bathrooms, like, where you can wash with a cloth.  Oh, of course.  And, like, little towels.  Yes.  And, like, little towels.  Really weird things make up different stars.  Amenities.  I don't know what makes a one star.  All right.  I think that means there's AIDS in the water. 
[01:22:00]  Are we going to work this out or not?  We're not going to work it out?  All right.  So that we can't stay at the...  I mean, can we just put this on the record, though?  I never said anything bad about you.  I never said anything bad either.  Okay.  Did you guys reserve the room?  Let me straight up that first.  Did you guys reserve it?  Oh, yeah, we did.  What's the name it's on there?  I'm scared now to say that.  Can we come back as different people and then check in?  I got, like, a real name.  All right.  So you don't want to stay in here, right? 
[01:22:30]  All right.  So we'll go.  What if I apologize?  You have insulted my place in us.  I didn't, though.  We know that.  Can we say that?  Can we get that on the record?  Can you give me, like, five minutes?  I'm going to find...  Because I have a link directly in my email that I'm going to show you.  What?  The videos?  I know the videos well.  I put them online, and they did really well.  And as far as a comedy video goes, they did great.  Hang on one second.  Yeah.  Right back.  We're just going to talk to Rich. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  See if there's another place we can stay.  Because now I'm insulted.  I'm insulted!  She's obsessed with showing us the video.  Yeah.  She wants...  I'm like, I know the video.  I made it.  She's been waiting for this.  We can get past that.  But she's been waiting to show you the video.  And then Bobby...  Like, aha!  Bobby's hung out with me enough to know that I'm going into asshole mode, so that's why  he goes, I'll be right back.  Because the guy that was going to be taking us on our little expedition there, he met 
[01:23:30]  us there.  Oh, no.  So he had an excuse of, like, I'm going to go talk to Rich.  Uh-huh.  Because he knew I was going into asshole mode.  Because now it's like, now I'm going to have some fun with this lady.  Oh, no.  You don't understand comedy, I guess, huh?  When you put businesses like this on comedy, we lose revenue.  It's the wrong impression that people are getting out there.  Let me see the books.  I bet you lost no money year to year because of my video.  I would bet money on that.  We don't...  Okay.  I would bet money on that.  When people say... 
[01:24:00]  When people see things, it's the computer.  I would bet money on that.  Don't blame me because your business is failing.  I'm not blaming you because of my decision.  Because to be honest, in town, we talked to someone at the fly fishing place and they  asked where we were staying.  I said, the Roscoe Motel, we had a fine time last year.  And they said, oh, I wouldn't stay there.  And they gave us three or four different motels.  So don't blame me on some dumb video I made that your business is failing.  I'm not blaming you.  I'm only pointing out what you did wrong for my business. 
[01:24:30]  I didn't do nothing wrong.  I made a comedy video.  You just said shit hole.  Well, it is kind of shit hole.  Okay, well, thank you.  Well, it is because you've got a pool over there that is filled with weeds.  So it's not weeds, it's a vegetable garden.  It's not a vegetable garden.  It's weeds.  Now we're arguing if that's weeds, Bobby.  Now we're arguing if that's weeds in the swimming pool.  It might be a garden.  She's saying it's a vegetable garden.  I'm saying weeds.  It might be a garden.  But don't you think that's an eyesore for your place? 
[01:25:00]  We've got to go.  I'm just trying to make you...  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  What?  We're in the country.  We're in the country.  All right, but why don't you make it into a nice lawn and then people won't see that?  That used to be a pool and now there's weeds in it.  Okay, well, it's on my property.  I will do anything I want with my property.  Right.  Now, if I see my credit card charged for anything, there's going to be problems.  That's why I want to cancel your room.  There's going to be problems.  You didn't like the weed pool?  Dude, and the fence was still around.  Like, it's a pool still?  Like, it's still a pool? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  I think the diving board's still there.  I don't know.  It's obvious that it was a pool and now there's weeds in it, but she says it's a vegetable garden.  A vegetable garden.  A vegetable garden.  She's like fucking Chekhov.  And then finally, this is me storming out and then we can move on.  Okay, so we're canceled.  Yes.  All right.  We're canceled.  All right.  What if we make...  What do we make a video that says the place is nice?  It doesn't matter.  You guys have insult...  Well...  I have it.  Okay, well, I got insulted.  I get offended.  You guys have insulted my... 
[01:26:00]  I haven't.  Well...  I haven't.  I haven't said one word.  I can't help if you don't understand.  I actually fancy the Roscoe Motel.  When I said your place was a shithole, that was humor.  Obviously, it's...  No.  I haven't done it.  It's an okay place, one star on the internet type of place.  Okay.  So, obviously, it has charm.  All right.  Let's go.  We gotta go.  If you're a millionaire, I'm sure you can buy something.  Multi-millionaire!  And now I'm gonna come back and buy this shithole.  Jesus.  Good day.  You're dead?  Good day.  Good day.  Good day. 
[01:26:30]  Funny.  Multi!  That sounded like...  That's right.  That sounded like two mental patients discussing something with a rational woman.  Yeah, I know.  How did you get the audio so good?  That was pretty good audio.  Yeah, I had my video camera.  So...  Nice.  Nicey-nice.  It sounded good.  Well, she, uh...  Well, she stuck to her guns.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  You could have convinced her.  If you didn't call it a shithole, you could have convinced her.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounded like, okay, now that you said shithole, now you're out.  I think you'd have been...  She didn't want to fucking give up business.  Yeah, but in my head, I'm thinking this...  We're in the middle of nowhere.  There's no fucking way I'm gonna take the chance now.  I'm gonna call her brothers up and her cousins and have you guys worked over.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  There's a river right behind the damn place.  Oh, you just dumped the bodies in there.  There's no Indian gangsters in Roscoe, New York.  Dude.  How is the Indian syndicate up there?  Yeah.  Who knows, though, man?  I wasn't gonna take that chance. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  You sleep with the wishes.  They are here.  They are here.  I put them in room eight.  Yes.  Go in, and here's the key.  Right.  And they can just open the door and beat the piss out of you.  Yeah, you don't even get the knock at the door.  You call it a shithole?  Fuck yeah.  Wouldn't you think that?  I would think so.  That there's at least a possibility of that?  You are a bad man.  You are a very, very bad man.  There's some people on TripAdvisor who also think it's a shithole.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That have nothing to do with me, right? 
[01:28:00]  No, no, no.  Yeah, they're actually people who stayed there.  Location is nice.  Hotel is in need of TLC.  Rooms are bad.  Tons of insects and bugs.  Owners are friendly, but rooms are creepy.  Insects and bugs.  That explains it perfectly.  Perfectly.  I even got video of a bug last year.  Musty, musty, musty room smell.  The room itself was shabby, which I certainly could have put up with, but not the mildewy smell  that made it difficult to bear.  Oh, wow.  How come they said the room needs some TLC? 
[01:28:30]  I'd bring my own pillow and blanket now.  Oh, you should?  Always.  Yeah, contaminate that.  Ah, whatever.  Didn't throw the fucking pillowcase away.  I would have had Kenny call and see if they had feather pillows.  Oh, I'm sure that would have worked.  He always checks.  See some fucking half a retard shooting at ducks outside and putting it in a bag for you.  Yeah, we got it.  So.  I'm putting it in a bag.  That's a little taste of the weekend. 
[01:29:00]  Poor lady.  So where did you end up staying?  The Baxter House, which is, see, this is why she's stupid.  Because if we had a good time there, I would have promoted her place.  Baxter House was fine.  The Baxter House is the people that took us on the trip.  You know, they have a nice fly fishing, you know, business right there.  It's technically a bed and breakfast.  Oh, boy.  We got back from dinner and they're like, yeah, rooms one and two.  It's the house.  Look, it's someone's house.  But there's no one in there. 
[01:29:30]  But you just stayed with him.  You probably had that entire house.  There was no one else in there.  I swear to God.  They're like, the door was wide open.  They're like, ah, rooms one and two.  They're yours.  Wow.  That's all they have.  I don't even think the guy charged me.  I left my credit card, so whatever.  I never went out of sleep.  I never would have been able to sleep.  No.  Well, the roosters woke me up at 5 o'clock in the morning.  Where's room service?  That's a story for another dog.  You wouldn't stay there?  No.  It looks terrible.  It's not.  Staying at someone's house.  I don't like bed and breakfast. 
[01:30:00]  I've done one or two in my life.  It was a bed place.  I feel like Vito after I quit blowing somebody on the lam and staying at bed and breakfast.  I wouldn't call it a bed and breakfast.  It was a bed.  But there was someone there.  There was no one there.  No one.  There wasn't an owner?  No one.  So they gave you the keys.  Because no one was really up there because they knew the fly fishing was going to be  kind of shitty, but it was the only weekend we could do it, so we went for it.  So there was no one else in the house.  Anywhere in the house?  Yes.  What was in the kitchen?  Nothing in the refrigerator.  I think, no, two gallons of lemonade it looked like. 
[01:30:30]  Either that or piss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  I didn't, you know.  And then there were like eight bedrooms.  And a living room.  A bed and breakfast in Woodstock years ago with my ex.  Yeah.  It was actually okay.  It wasn't that bad.  I had never stayed in one.  Yeah.  And it was kind of a quiet mountain place.  I didn't like the idea of the breakfast in the kitchen.  But there was tables outside we could eat at.  What, you got to eat with the other people?  So where are you from?  Shut up.  Oh, I could jerk.  Oh, just dealing with people like that? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  That they, I don't know who the fuck they are.  I don't give a shit.  No, this was.  Just sit there and eat with them.  After being on the river 10 hours and we went out to dinner.  Then we checked out the UFC fights.  It was like 1130 at night.  All you want to do is fucking put your head down.  I didn't give a fuck.  I slept.  And that was it.  We got up early and got the fuck out of there.  So that was it.  I'll post some new videos.  The preview video is pretty good.  Did you see the one where Rich falls?  Oh, yeah.  And everyone thinks it's Rich Voss.  No, no.  It's not Rich Voss.  If you look closely, just because a guy's name is Rich doesn't mean it's Rich Voss. 
[01:31:30]  But he's doing something stupid.  So that really doubles the possible Voss condition.  The confusion.  Yeah, that one.  And then, of course, Bobby doesn't know how to.  Kicked out of the Roscoe Motel.  Yes.  We've been to the festival, the Roscoe Festival.  I've been put in jail.  Portrait mode.  Always portrait mode.  And we bought soap.  Bobby.  I don't know why he does this.  From a one-footed lady.  Because he's stupid.  Not a club foot.  No, it was a club foot.  Okay.  I love that place.  Yeah.  Very nice lady.  Club foot. 
[01:32:00]  It's not a place.  Milk.  Oh, I thought it was a whole goat.  No, no.  Just goat and milk.  Yeah, just the milk.  Oh, I thought she boiled down goats and made soap out of it.  And we're ready to go.  There's Rich.  Rich.  Rich.  Oh!  That does fall on his ass.  Exactly.  Can we see that again, please?  There's nothing better.  There's our guy we're trusting.  Yeah.  Falling down the bank.  Falling down his ass. 
[01:32:30]  But he got up good.  Yeah, he got up pretty well.  It is YouTube.  You got to do the three times slow motion.  No, no.  It's funny.  I know.  You're right.  It's hack.  I love it, though.  You have to, though.  If someone falls, it's only a second.  You got to kind of take advantage of it a little bit, right?  Yeah, you got to do it a couple of times.  We just lucked down and got him falling.  But he was our guy.  He was cool as shit.  Rich is all right.  But the idea of doing that, putting on those waist-high, fucking neat, like, water thing.  The waiters.  Waiters.  See how you get your drinks or something.  Ah, no, Chip. 
[01:33:00]  But why?  Why wouldn't you just try something new?  I've fished in my life.  Yeah.  My idea of trying something new is, like, I want to stay in a nice hotel here and there.  Oh, yeah.  Or, you know, it's just not my thing.  Outdoor's not my thing.  I need accommodations with all the accoutrement.  Yeah.  I need room service 24 hours.  I need a mini bar.  I need cable television.  But what if you're just sleeping?  Because you're being an adventure all day.  Huh?  Who sleeps?  Yeah.  You're better sleeper than I am. 
[01:33:30]  A little fun.  Well, the fun was on the river.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, it was.  16 miles oozing down a river.  Yeah.  Catching one fish by accident.  Yeah.  Getting thrown out of a shithole.  I got thrown out of a one-star motel.  A one-star.  Not even a hotel.  Motel.  It's $60 a night, I found out.  Damn.  Can I say the Trump Hotel in fucking Chicago is fucking amazing. 
[01:34:00]  You were there recently?  Yes, I was.  Nice.  Fly fishing?  Yes, I was.  Jimmy was doing some fly fishing himself.  I was trying to catch fucking bad toupees off the streets.  What a building that is.  An 88-floor building.  Wow.  It's only 27 floors of hotel.  The rest is residences.  Right.  But God, that type of thing is worth, to me, like when you said, don't you like adventure?  That kind of thing.  I want to spend more time in Chicago, like four or five days there, really fucking-  And take a look at it.  Yeah.  I mean, I've worked there a million times.  I've never actually just spent time there without working. 
[01:34:30]  I've never been.  I want to go badly.  You never went to Chicago.  That's right.  No.  But I would love to do that too, you know?  I like checking shit out.  That place is fucking fantastic.  Yeah.  Loved it.  Is it the premier hotel in America right now?  I don't think so.  It's one of the newest ones, right?  I don't know if it's in America.  Wow, that's nice.  I stay in a-  Places I stay in L.A. are pretty good because they have to be because there's so much competition.  Sure, sure.  But I would say that that's one of the better hotels I've stayed in.  It's a five-star hotel.  Yeah.  It has to be.  Guest rooms and suites.  Do they have a suite at the Roscoe Hotel there? 
[01:35:00]  No.  I don't know.  It's called the parking lot.  Yeah.  I filmed it last time.  Where one of the fucking-  Their suite is where the water went through the roof and rotted the drywall between two rooms.  Right.  So they just kind of busted a hole in there.  I don't know if they have a rotted roof.  I don't feel like dealing with those people anymore.  Oh, I don't either.  I've never been there.  I'm sure it's charming.  But they had a horrible old phone.  They had a horrible square TV in that place.  Yeah.  You know.  Was it one of those ring, ring? 
[01:35:30]  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah.  Poor lady.  She's just priding her.  Oh, she really is.  In her shithole.  Yeah, she's just trying to make her do it.  Bobby felt bad.  I'm like, come on, Bobby.  Jesus Christ.  She seemed like she was more-  She didn't seem like a bitch.  She really did seem like she was just, her feelings were hurt.  Yeah.  It wasn't like, now you got the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't throw you out like Jack Walton.  Yeah.  No, that's why I was trying to have fun with it, too, a little bit.  I didn't mean anything I said to that stupid lady.  Bob Kelly is the horse's ass left on the bed.  So, there you have it. 
[01:36:00]  I'll put some videos up eventually.  I got to edit my balls off to make it look good.  Ow.  Want to take a break?  Sure.  So, you guys don't want to go fishing?  No.  Why not, man?  I just don't.  I don't like fishing.  I like a good river view with my hotel.  Yeah.  Really?  Fuck, man.  Beautiful, right?  That's what the Trump Hotel in Chicago is.  See, I would like that, too, of course.  Of course I would like that. 
[01:36:30]  Of course I would like that.  The best room in the motel last year, last time you went.  Kenny had a whisper that in your ear, because now Kenny thinks he didn't do his job properly.  Oh, that's right.  I know what this is about.  Room 8 with the king bed in the river view.  Kenny was ready to take a drive up to the Roscoe Motel.  He texted me, is it true you got kicked out?  I'm like, Kenny, it's okay.  It's okay.  When we saw the trouble he had making the reservations, trying to speak to the person that couldn't  speak any English, all that trouble, Kenny, for naught.  Well, that was the mother. 
[01:37:00]  Then I called back later and spoke to the daughter, who's more Americanized.  That was what I had problems with.  And then I back it up with an email, so I have the paper trail.  Ah, there you go.  And Mr. Hughes was reserved the best room in the house.  Room number 8, which had a king-size bed and a river view.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  That sounds great.  Yeah.  That sounds real nice.  Oh, well, hopefully they'll continue to be fine.  Yeah, let's forgive and forget. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, just leave.  By the way, and I'm kind of begging, just leave her alone.  Yeah.  Just leave her alone.  She seemed nice.  Just leave her alone.  And what are you going to tell?  The video's funny, but she seemed like a nice lady.  Just leave her alone.  Just trying to make a go at it.  Thank you, nice lady.  When she had to tell me it was a one-star motel, you could tell she's like...  One.  Really bummed.  And she kind of wishes it was a two-star.  Trying to bring it up to two.  She would love it to be a two.  They look up to the Motel A people, they probably think they're like fancy pants.  That paneling in there is just... 
[01:38:00]  I mean, they're not bringing in too much money.  It's got to be very hard to make a go at a fucking motel in a small town.  $60 a night, that's like nothing.  And you two are the only reservations.  Well, that's what I'm looking at.  I'm like, you're really not going to let us stay here?  I'm checking out the only people that are going to be here.  I just brought a little of the audio because there was a lot more to it.  I'm like, you're really not going to let us stay here?  I said, you have an empty parking lot right now.  Yeah.  This is not good for your business if you want to talk about what's good for your business. 
[01:38:30]  How many rooms are there?  Probably like 10, I would guess.  Somewhere around there.  A dozen rooms.  You should have bought the whole thing for $600 and just invited trannies up.  We've done something really bizarre.  That wouldn't be bizarre.  Not like inviting trannies up isn't that bizarre.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get into some other things.  Oh, I'm going to get into Ant taking on protesters. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was talking about the whole Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street thing that was going on over the weekend and last week.  Quite entertaining to watch you fight those people.  Right up until I saw what was happening well before the protesters saw it, and I laughed my balls off.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's great.  NYPD.  You know, they were blockading us, but now they're escorting us to the park.  Really?  Dummies don't see what's happening.  We'll explain next.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  It's fantastic.  We'll clear the field, and we'll get into Anthony fighting the protesters down there at Wall Street.  It's terrific.  Stay there.  And now, Vaginal Self-Esteem by Jim Norton.  What's better than fucking an asshole that dumb tampon string dangles, showing the vagina how replaceable it is?  What's better than when the fucking tamp string is hitting your bag?  And it's like the pussy going, God damn, am I easily replaceable.  Do you realize I am the birthplace of life?  And now that I'm not operational, the play shit comes out is working just as well. 
[01:40:00]  The vagina must have low self-esteem.  You might think you can sing.  Ooh-hoo.  But you're wrong.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Go up and smoke, baby.  And learn to sing like a champ.  Who's making love to my old lady while I'm out making love?  Joe doesn't just teach you to sing the classics.  He beats the awful right out of you.  When a man loves a woman.  Words is the most important thing, too. 
[01:40:30]  Let's say songs.  Because sometimes, you know that you...  After a few short weeks with Joe's unique approach to vocal training, you'll be belting out tunes just like Smokin' Joe belted Muhammad Ali.  Ooh!  Or you'll have brain damage.  Ah!  Spend two amazing weeks in Joe Frazier's 700-square-foot apartment above his Philadelphia boxing gym.  And floor your friends with your amazing vocal chops.  Joe might have high blood pressure, diabetes, and needs to carry a cane to stand upright.  But his magical voice will bring you to tears. 
[01:41:00]  Mustang selling now, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow than Mustang down.  Ow!  And if that doesn't, his left hook will.  You'll be hitting the high notes faster than Joe Frazier hits the canvas.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp, where our motto is...  Me, you ain't used these, and she better head off.

[01:42:00]  Got to be a joker.  He just do what he please.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh해 road 42 years ago today?  All right.  My God.  It's a long time ago.  I fucking liked that song.  It's great.  Some Beatles songs I hate. 
[01:42:30]  I hate that poppy shit.  I like the trippy Beatles.  You don't like the original kind of...  I saw her standing there and all that crap.  Fuck no.  I wanna hold your hand.  No!  That's a good song.  No, the original Beatles are like fucking old weird covers.  I don't mind it.  I think you lost your love when I saw her yesterday.  You don't like that?  I love that.  As far as pop songs go, of course they're great, but I like trippy shit.  I'll take I Am The Walrus any time over that stuff. 
[01:43:00]  Do you like that?  I just saw a face.  It's a good one.  I've Just Seen A Face.  Oh, yeah.  How does that go?  I've Just Seen A Face.  I can't forget the time of place when we first met you.  You're just a girl for me and I don't want to fall in your soul.  But then he just goes.  It's just great fucking.  What a good fucking song.  The band was amazing.  It really.  How can anybody not like the Beatles?  You don't like the Beatles, just kill yourself.  I can't forget the time or place where we just met. 
[01:43:30]  She's just a girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met.  What a cool thing to do.  I've never been another day.  I might have looked the other way and I'd have never been a word.  That's a Simon and Garfunkel feel to it, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Falling.  Yes, I am falling.  And she keeps calling me back again.  A little harmony in there.  It's almost like a little rockabilly in there, too. 
[01:44:00]  I got the Beatles box set.  Do you listen to the early years of the Beatles?  You can't believe it's the same band.  I know.  Like the real early ones.  Way, way early.  Going way the fuck back.  It's got like a 50s sound to it.  Big time.  Big time.  Very bluesy.  They're very influenced by those old black performers.  Those old black guys.  Yeah, old blues guys.  That's who like McCartney and those guys look up to.  And I don't like the hacky Beatles, like Rocky Raccoon and the Yellow Submarine. 
[01:44:30]  I like Yellow Submarine.  Novelty song.  Yeah, I don't like that shit.  Even when I'm 64.  Yeah.  And Paul McCartney wishes he was still wondering what 64 was like.  Holy shit.  What do I like about Yellow Submarine?  There's something I like about that.  I don't remember.  The bubbly sound.  That is shaped like a penis.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I'm fighting back because I took a few hits. 
[01:45:00]  Very funny.  You like the chanty part?  I don't know.  Is it all of them?  We all live in it.  That's like a fucking drinking song.  It really isn't even a bad song.  I just don't like it.  Ding, da, ding, ding.  This is Harrison, right?  Ringo.  This is Ringo?  Yeah.  This is Ringo.  The Ringo one. 
[01:45:30]  I like the way he's like.  Turn this up.  The way it picks up, like here.  We.  I just like this song.  A little wave sound.  See it, green.  See it, green.  And we lived.  Not yet.  Beneath the waves.  And I'm just adding my own part.  Uncle Albert.  Yeah.  It's a marine sandwich.  It's really not a bad song.  It's a big, not pills.  I love that.  They're singing about pills. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Oh, shit.  Yes.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  I used to get.  I want to laugh with that.  They live next door.  Where do you live next door?  Next door.  A fucking submarine.  What do you live on the fucking dock?  Oh, the fan's playing.  This is catchy.  It is.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich. 
[01:46:30]  Yellow submarine sandwich.  What are we making about this E-Roc?  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Oh, some shit's happening on this sub.  They're going down.  There's a man talking through something that's hollow.  There's a periscope.  A little bell ringing.  Why is a yellow submarine on top of, like, some kind of monument now? 
[01:47:00]  Like a Mayan temple.  Why?  What's going on?  I don't know.  This is their acid base.  They're going to play the whole fucking thing.  It's the blue meanie.  Sky blue.  Inside the yellow.  Oh, wait.  Wait till the chorus comes.  I'll make everybody laugh.  Turn it up.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich. 
[01:47:30]  Yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Yellow submarine.  Yellow submarine.  We all live in a yellow submarine.  Submarine sandwich.  Oh, I'm so tired.  Submarine sandwich.  do you want to know what 
[01:48:00]  Justin Bieber's up to sure  now  I already know  the answer but I'm going to ask anyway  do you think this is cool or really  well it involves Bieber  so whatever else is  the other answer  do you think what he did is cool or kind of  almost  over the top fake romantic  shit I think it's horrible  does it involve Selena Gomez  Selena Gomez is going to move on from  Justin Bieber I can't sooner than later 
[01:48:30]  he's so stupid  she needs fucking penis  a man's dick you think  she needs a man's dick  Justin Bieber tries to act like he's a tough guy  he's nowhere near a tough guy  he doesn't have a man's dick  this is what Justin Bieber did  he rented out the Staples Center  to watch Titanic with Selena Gomez  that's bad right  the Staples Center  but that's bad right  wait a minute  but why would he rent such a bitch 
[01:49:00]  where the fuck do you watch  yeah  he was trying to impress her obviously  but that's weird  to watch Titanic  it sounds almost cool  but then the reality is  you're sitting in a couple shitty seats  in an empty fucking  giant arena  well he said what happened was  they got dinner  they went to Demi Lovato concert  because I guess there's a concert venue  that's attached to the Staples Center  who is that bitch  as Jimmy would say  who is that Demi Lovato bitch  she's one of the Disney girls  who went to rehab  oh  she okay I hope  she's fine now 
[01:49:30]  I hope she was doing lots of drugs  she's fine now  I didn't hear that  she's allotated  was she on Ellen recently  uh probably  I think I might have saw her  but so they go like  I know Ellen  shut up already  he took uh  Selena Gomez  through the under tunnel  whatever  to get to the Staples Center  where he surprised her  with a dinner  where they ate  in the middle of the court there  well who was serving dinner  on the Staples Center court  the people who  there's a fancy restaurant  at the Staples Center  they catered it 
[01:50:00]  and then they watched  Titanic together  but the reason you could  just see the emotional depth  to this is that he said  he got the idea  uh when he watched  uh Mr. Deeds  starring Adam Sandler  oh god  what happens in that  cause I don't watch  Adam Sandler movies  for the most part  well Mr. Deeds is uh  uh like a local guy  who ends up  with a distant relative  who dies  and he gets rich  and moves to the city  and then he goes  Adam Sandler  he goes on a date  with Winona Ryder  so wait a minute  Winona Ryder 
[01:50:30]  is she Winona Ryder  in the movie  or is she  some chick  no she's  an entertainment reporter  it would have been better  if she was Winona Ryder  cause he would have been  able to afford her  and then like  they go to a store  and she steals shit  and he's like  an accomplice  yeah  that's a movie  gets arrested  Winona Ryder  what is she  in a car or something  no she's not  it's just her last name  spelled different too  there's a Y in it  what is she a truck  or something  no it's not Ryder  or anything  like well  it could be Ryder truck 
[01:51:00]  but it's just  it's not though  it's just her last name  but it's her last name  Chip  Winona  too bad a name  is not Wayesia  why  that makes no sense  Chip  at all  let's see the trailer  of a movie  that came out  10-12 years ago  Mr. Deeds  yes  I'm curious  Mr. Duds  a 40 billion dollar  empire was at stake  if I lose control  of this company  it'll be catastrophic  oh that guy  the bad guy  all that was needed  to stay in power  did we find this area  was a simple handshake  long call of Deeds  handshakes are for strangers 
[01:51:30]  pal  we hug around here buddy  what's up  what's up  can you pause this  why does Adam Sandler  think his personality  is so great  that he just plays  himself in every  fucking movie  I'm just gonna talk  a little  we don't shake hands  around here  we hug  he just never  changes it up  oh I'm gonna give you  a little hug  and then we'll sing a song  sings about being a Jill right  no he doesn't sing  my mother didn't like that  sings about that 
[01:52:00]  the Hanukkah  sings a lot of different songs  the poetic guy  I promise to love you  for 50 years more  even when your bosoms  sag down to the floor  but now  he'll be called  the rich guy  this is major  I got wicked bad frostbite  when I was in the scouts  check it out  the hideousness 
[01:52:30]  of that fort  will home to my dreams  forever  oh yeah  I've heard that before  one man is going to  the strong society  he writes greeting cards  do you write your poems  with a crayon deeds  some small town values  and if it wasn't for  Miss Dawson being here  it'd probably knock your heads in  I don't mind  okay  Adam Sandler's a tough guy  he's always a tough guy  in a fancy restaurant  yeah  sorry about that  good to meet you guys 
[01:53:00]  thank you  you can do it  didn't feel it  isn't that awesome  go ahead  enjoy the fort  no you're starting to  wank it aren't you  you're sick  you're sick  why would you do that  to me  I'm just kidding  you fellas  summer 2002  so Justin Bieber  saw that  like on DVD  or something  and thought  this is how  I'm going to charm  Selena Gomez  yeah  so they rented  they had the restaurant  I bet she was embarrassed  she said come on 
[01:53:30]  it's like 11 o'clock at night  I just want to go home  we saw a show already  I don't want to watch this movie  I've seen this already  Titanic is so long  I know we're talking about  Justin Bieber here  but it smells of desperation  he even knows  he can't fucking  hang on to  Selena Gomez  because the only thing  he really has to do  is slip her the old dick  and he don't have that  man's dick  he doesn't have that  to like fuck  he's just sitting there  they're like  pump  pump  pump  like a couple of pumps  and then he just goes  and then it's over  and she's just like 
[01:54:00]  un-fucking satisfied  he's the two-pump chump  yeah  practice his dance moves  after that  and he's like  yeah  and then the conversation  turns to like him  and his show  give us a picture  of Selena Gomez  you know what  and this will explain  everything  he knows  he knows  he's barely hanging on  the publicist  it's a publicist  dream that type of thing  it's all bullshit  they are  they're in that  uber famous category  where they do shit like this  to keep up their uber fame  yeah  there's no way  they're fucking really in love  and all that shit 
[01:54:30]  my honest opinion  she's pretty  it makes this  it makes you say that Jimmy  yeah it makes a tiger  oh her boobies are coming in finally  oh they're very nice  very nice  tits  they're finally coming in  and what does Justin do with those  nothing  he like just  he grabs it like a softball  and puts his mouth on her nipple  and just goes  it just sucks real hard  he's still breastfeeding 
[01:55:00]  he has no idea  how to work a tit  it's always  it's always awkward  when you start getting with broads  and you  you only know  breastfeeding techniques  so you just  that's how you start  yeah  and then somewhere along the line  you go  oh okay  maybe I should be doing  something else with this  he doesn't know  the gentle  finger ass play  I still sit in a girl's lap  and have my feet kick  while I suck her tits  I kick my little feet  I would put on booties  so that's what  he did over the weekend 
[01:55:30]  I got kicked out  of a one star motel  and he's renting out  the Staples Center  the Staples Center  he didn't rent it out  they let him do it for free  of course they did  so I want to do it now  well you haven't sold it out  three times  so if he gets to do it for free  I want to do it for free  it's not for anybody  maybe I could get the  Nassau Coliseum  can you sell it out  three times  what  you gotta sell it out  three times  what  I couldn't even get  the Stress Factory  to do this  and then watch the place  fall apart  like the Titanic 
[01:56:00]  you can do that  I gotta decide  if I'm gonna get  my tickets this year  or not  I don't know  should I get  hockey tickets this year  how about no  why would you  after the way  they treat you  as a fan  yeah fuck you guys  you're terrible  that's right  does she have a big puss  I'm not sure  she has a fat pussy  she has a Mexican pussy  oh she's Mexican  she's got a little  something in there  speaking of Mexicans  oh did I see a good video  uh oh  was it Epi-Heading  yes but with a chainsaw  I've never seen that  are you kidding me 
[01:56:30]  oh is that the one  where the eye pops out  no  someone  this is brand new  I don't watch  beheading videos  just send those to Jimmy  he'll enjoy them  I will say this  I don't watch that shit  was the person dead  or alive when it was  oh they were both  it was  two guys from the  wow  let me see  two guys from the  uh  the Sinola cartel  what  I'm guessing the Zetas  did it  they sound nice  and none of the  two guys  no shirts  Catherine Zeta Joneses  um  that was Anthony  who made that joke  not Jim Norton  look at her tits 
[01:57:00]  they got bigger  yeah man  she's finally a woman  she put a little bit  of uh  beef on her there  a little bit  a little beef  what are you doing  going  Jim wanted the vagina  oh right okay  without the head  I think she's got  some hair on there  Jimmy wants to see  the vagina without the head  look I don't think  she's she  look you can see  kind of texture of hair  she's got a little  that Mexican or something  that shit grows back fast  yeah  she probably shaved  in the morning  five o'clock shadow  yeah  so I was uh  watching  it's two guys kneeling  with a big wall 
[01:57:30]  behind them  and they're speaking  in Spanish  for three minutes  the guys are asking  them questions  whoever it is  and these  want them answered  immediately  these tough  motherfuckers man  they're both just  sitting there  answering the questions  and then the camera  pulls back  and you see one of the  guys they're all  in paramilitary clothing  and he's holding  a chainsaw  and he fucking  starts it  and he fucking  just whacks it  against the first  guy's neck  and the guy  backs up  and his neck blows  and then he just  fucking  it's very quick  the chainsaw  was very very quick 
[01:58:00]  efficient for cutting  heads off  but the guy next to him  just kind of  just moved away  didn't fucking  react  like he knew  he was dead next  but man  that tough  motherfucker  didn't  scream  he didn't  he just kind of  looked down at it  and just waited there  and they fucking  another guy came over  with a knife  and started beheading  him with a knife  and then he was like  oh oh  you know  as it was happening  how do you watch this  but that  I've never seen  a tougher  under pressure  knew he was about 
[01:58:30]  to be beheaded  just like movie balls  fuck dude  fucking  crazy  it's like  you just can't comprehend  the level of balls  that these guys have  sanity  why do you watch that  those mexicans  are fucking crazy  those drug cartels  fuck that  dangerous  oh are they  fucking crazy  yeah fuck anyone  fuck your mafia  even your russian mafia  even the colombians  none of them  are this bad  the mexicans  are just  they just start  they're beheading people 
[01:59:00]  and throwing them  in resort areas  yeah  like some resort areas  in acapulco and stuff  it's like here you go  here's what mexico's about  enjoy  I wouldn't go anywhere  near me  any part of mexico  at all  and they're probably  trying to hurt tourism  your trip will take you  to puerto vallarta  mexico  that was the old days  i'd be like all nice  where you could smoke  on the plane  and i was like  did the chainsaw  fire right up  first pull  yeah  oh the guy was probably 
[01:59:30]  like ah fuck  but it hit him  it hit his head  can he need a new  spark plug  but it was amazing  how these guys reacted  because that whole time  he was talking  he saw that chainsaw  so he knew  yeah  they knew  maybe they thought  they'd be chopping  down some trees  and building themselves  a home  the one guy looks  a little bit like  bob kelly  he's just kind of  chubby and shirtless  but the fucking  balls on these guys  the first three minutes  there's no violence  it's just them talking  was there a lot of blood  oh from the chainsaw  fuck yeah 
[02:00:00]  yeah it went everywhere  it wasn't pleasant  it was really  it wasn't as upsetting  as other ones i've seen  though because the one guy  with the knife  you can't really see as much  because he's kind of  on the ground  so you can't actually  see it coming off  yeah  and the chainsaw  is so fast  it's like a movie  it literally is like  watching a fucking  and the guy's head's off  yeah that's not it  that's fucking it  it looks like  they're gonna shoot him  i'll tell you where to go  but you won't watch the video  but you can see the guy  the guy's uh  the guy's alive  i'll listen to it  oh i'll  no you don't have to  listen to it  i just want to hear  like hang hang hang hang  hold on 
[02:00:30]  yeah i mean  people ask me all the time  this is my line right here  i don't watch  this is the shit i don't watch  i could i could watch  just about anything  i like how it's like  graphic horror murder things  and on the right side  of the screen  is a link to click  with a video playing  of some chick  blowing a guy  but you just gotta see  the fucking guys  go down i'll show  which one of these  they're the fucking  you've never seen  i couldn't get over the balls  and let's keep going down  i couldn't get over the balls  on this fucking one guy  it's just you'll see two guys  kneeling  oh god 
[02:01:00]  that fucking  don't watch  the first few minutes  you're not gonna  it's literally  here play  just  just pause right there  this guy  these guys don't look happy  but that guy on the left  he's like  he's got man tits  bob kelly  that motherfucker  i've never seen  a guy react  as fearlessly  don't even play it  it's not worth playing  oh oh  no actually i want to hear  the chainsaw  oh you want to hear  okay  turn the monitor off  and just listen  just don't look  i'll do it  oh i won't look  i'll just close the curtain 
[02:01:30]  just look down  i'll just look down  i'll look  i'll look at the very bottom  of the picture  like this  i can't unwatch these  my name is  eddie vedder  look at the face  on the one left  there's nothing happening  he's just looking  straight ahead  yeah  but look at the  deadpan stare  on that fucking fat guy  yeah he's just like  fuck you  he knows he's a dead man  it's probably their  confession  like yeah  i fucked  i fucked up 
[02:02:00]  it's 220  okay  he's saying uh  i would love  i would love somebody  he looks like  fucking chef  from apocalypse  he really does  and the same result  yeah  i wish i knew  what he was saying  please don't  chop my head off  with a chainsaw  but the face  on the other guy  i can't stop  looking at other guys  he's just defiant  yeah  that's a tough 
[02:02:30]  fucking dude  uh-oh  uh-oh  oh boy  here  here comes  oh  wow  that's a lot of blood  can you see the guy  next to him  he's not moving  wow  how is that guy  still moving  look at the other guy  he's not fucking  blinking  no 
[02:03:00]  he's like well  that guy's problem  solved  well there was a  there was another one  but that  that fucking  the guy didn't move  no  you can't hear  all you hear  is chainsaw sounds  and he didn't go like  ah  was it bad ant  no  it wasn't that bad  it was pretty quick  there was a fuckload  it looks like something  out of a movie  that one there  because it's so  unexpected  it literally  that one is not  like the other ones  yeah  i think i finally  figured out why  you're not sleeping 
[02:03:30]  at night  that one  there's been a couple  you can watch those  and then like  try to go to sleep  at night  yeah there's only one  that i can't watch  and i've watched it once  and the other two times  i've put it on  it's made me feel like  i was gonna throw up  or faint  oh yeah  there's one that makes me  want to faint  it's so bad  and i can't watch  it's not a beheading  it's just a torture  it's a beating video  that these guys  overseas made  they killed like 21 people  in a month  in like some weird country  this guy could translate  he's from el paso  what was that 
[02:04:00]  i almost said el paso  el paso  what was he saying sir  oscar go  yeah  hey what's up  but he's uh  yeah he's basically  telling uh  he's like yeah  these guys mean business  they don't play around  uh you should have  messed with them  and then he's saying  uh if you see  if you see crimes  don't snitch  or this could happen to you  if you see anything  happening  just don't say nothing  oh  oh so it's like  a little warning video  yeah you know what  because in loreno  they're starting to kill  people that are on  the twitter 
[02:04:30]  and on the  there's a website  that i watch  every day  it shows nothing  but this stuff  and they're trying  to kill people  that post on that  website  oh yeah  some woman posted  something on a website  and they killed her  chopped her fucking head off  what'd she post  i don't know  mexicans have  dirty unclipped cocks  something like that  that the website  it's mundonarco.com  that's exactly the one  that was uh  mundonarco  but i i went to  mundonarco  i went to that one  and uh  i i didn't see anything 
[02:05:00]  on it  i don't read spanish  so i didn't know  how to navigate it  on the very top  it says videos  if you click videos  it'll take you to  all the gruesome videos  oh  but the cartels  aren't putting them up  yeah the cartels  are putting them up  themselves  and uh  well then why  are they killing  people who post on them  because there's rival cartels  like the sinaloa cartel  is one cartel  and the people killing them  are the fetas  they're the ones  that they're respiting against  what's the name of the one  the first one you said  sinaloa cartel  oh sinaloa  okay  and uh 
[02:05:30]  oh they're not killing people  for watching them  or for going there  and putting videos up  no no  no the fetas are  the fetas are killing people  that are posting comments  and posting videos  so you know  message boards  you hear  you see some  and then here  you would write back  you know  oh fuck you  and fuck you  I'm banning you  or something  there they cut your head off  with a chainsaw  so wait  they're killing people  for posting on the site  negative shit  yeah for posting  negative shit  posting comments  they killed  they threw two people  off a bridge 
[02:06:00]  and hung them  and left a message  they're saying  these two people  wanted to talk shit  about us  and we found them  and the lady  they just killed  I think yesterday  they uh  they shot her  they shot her in the head  and put her back over  and they  they said that  she was posting  on the site  she was one of the contributors  this is what happens  to contributors  damn  man you can't  you just  the mexican cartels  you you are  whoever fucks with those  you can't fuck with them  no  you just can't  man I live five minutes 
[02:06:30]  from the Juarez border  and I haven't been to Juarez  in like 15 years  wow Juarez  Juarez is scary man  that's a very very  frightening place  um there's  isn't that the highest  murder rate in Mexico  yes sir  and I'm from Juarez  and I don't go over there  man shit  yeah a couple college students  from Texas went over there  to uh  excuse me  to um  buy like a car  but they figured  they'd get it cheaper there  all three of them  were just shot at the dealers  ugh  and a lot of those  a lot of the cartel members  are  they're  they're not  they're not crazy guys 
[02:07:00]  like they're ex-cops  they're ex-military  they're all  they're all  they're all very very  they know what they're doing  they just found uh  found out there's a lot more money  to be made  in these uh  drug cartels  it's amazing to me  that they can be so ruthless though  like as you think of a cop  you think of  but there's no  thank you very much man  I just  to fuck with those guys  I can't comprehend it  oh  and the guy was  expressionless  according to somebody  because that guy  has done the exact same thing  so  maybe  or maybe  I don't know if they were on anything 
[02:07:30]  that's what this guy said  what is this guy  um  wait a minute  it goes  a chainsaw  nicks the guy  uh  and he said something about  why the guys aren't reacting  yeah  that's what I said  I don't know where he went  why  is it because people  no because that guy  is used to doing the exact same thing  but then he knows what's coming  I mean  yeah true  how do you not react to that  like  yeah  he just kind of looks over like  oh yeah  maybe he doesn't react  because for the cause  look at his head  you know what I mean  dude that's a fucking  for the other guys that are  are still alive  getting shot is one thing 
[02:08:00]  but that's fucking  this guy's worried about you Jimmy  Jimmy in Staten Island  Jimmy  Jimmy  what do you get out of watching this  you're really creeping me  the fuck out bro  yeah I can't watch it myself  but  dude it's the same thing  it literally  it doesn't  I wouldn't say  what it's done for me  it is horrifying  but it's made me  in an odd way  more empathetic  towards people  like  when I hear  somebody's  yeah  bad car accident  like I've seen so many  of those horrible videos  I really like  feel something  for the people  who've been in the car accident  I know that sounds crazy 
[02:08:30]  but Jim  Jim  dude hold on  everybody slows down  to look at a car accident  every person  does it  this is just  one step beyond that  this is really  no different  yeah but it's  it's murder  it's death  an accident  but this is  this is  this is  this is  it's horrid  it is horrid  it is absolutely horrid  I don't know what it does for me  I'll say I don't  I don't enjoy it  like it's fun  it's very upsetting  well listen 
[02:09:00]  all I don't know Jim  how many have you seen Jimmy  a lot  oh wow I see  I think you showed us one  I decided to watch one with you  and that was it for me  they're very sad  I don't  yeah I don't know  why would you want to bring yourself  down to that level  I don't know  but you do certainly  there's enough shit that happens  to you in this fucking world  that you don't need to  bring yourself there on purpose  but that most times  you read things  you watch them on the news  they feel sanitized  and they don't  you feel nothing  right  I feel nothing  when I hear 30 people were shot  I know intellectually  that that's very sad  right  but it's like 
[02:09:30]  you're so used to hearing it  you're so used to reading it  you feel nothing  yeah  but when you see something like that  you're like that is  it's a visceral reaction  and it's like  wow that's a fucking real thing  that's not something  that they could just deliver to you  in a sound bite  like that's a real  horrible  fucking thing  that happens  but when he just  nicked that guy's neck  he started bleeding pretty good  and that's what it really looks like  jugular out  and then it's like  well I gotta get the rest off  yeah  chainsaw really goes through your head 
[02:10:00]  pretty easy huh  it certainly does  and neck bone  don't do shit  for a fucking nice  still blade  but I felt so bad  for this one video  that I can't watch  I felt so bad  for the guy  that was suffering through it  I looked him up  who he was online  I found like photos of him  of his wife  it's like  just like to see  the human side  of this terrible fucking  thing I had seen  I don't mean to bring the show down  I was just mentioning  the guy looks like Bob Kelly  and he had balls  don't worry about me  believe me 
[02:10:30]  I really feel very very  bad for the people  who are being injured  and you'd have to worry about me  if I felt nothing watching it  but I feel terrible for them  Jimmy  Jimmy  my five year old son  says blueberries  like like  like  what you do  that's good  hi  yeah  say blueberries  blueberries  blueberries  blueberries  goodbye  that's opi's anyway  bye  it's fine  I've never seen that television 
[02:11:00]  yeah I don't know  it made me not go back to Iraq  there's a lot of people  that do check that shit out  but I just  it made me not go back  to Iraq dude  it scared me so much  the beheadings  yeah I would love to go back  and entertain troops  I'm just not as brave  as the troops are  like what if you're  in a helicopter  and it just goes down  a technical  malfunction  and they get you  it just  it scared me too much  oh they drag you  someplace  and all of a sudden  you're there  in that room  with the knife  and the guys  at the hoods  and you're like  oh no this is 
[02:11:30]  oh shit  I know it's gonna happen now  I feel bad  besides the horrible  physical stuff  the  it's the helplessness  of the person  suffering through it  that gets to me  it's like  it's the utter  hopelessness  and it's an animal  reaction  to being killed  in a way  where  like  you're not a human  anymore  you're making animal  noises  you're struggling  like trying to get away  like a fucking  wounded deer  it's the lack of  ability to negotiate  your way out of it 
[02:12:00]  that I find troubling  like you know  you can usually  talk your way  but there's nothing  when Al-Qaeda  was ready  you know  this group  when Al-Zarqawi  especially  when they were ready  to lop your head off  there was nothing  there's no talking  you could say  that would have  negotiated your way out  it was an impossibility  it's like Madsen  in Reservoir Dogs  you finished?  yeah  you finished?  that's exactly  like please  please  just don't burn  my other family  you finished?  you finished?  like there's no  no negotiating  my manager goes over  there sometimes  he went to Afghanistan 
[02:12:30]  recently  and he knows people  that like  but he didn't go  he went as a tourist  like he didn't go  with the military  he knows people there  he went as a tourist  like he literally went  go to a war zone  there's probably 10 people  that actually do that  he told me a story  that was very scary  about being in the  Afghanistan countryside  and I told him  before he went  I'm like have you  watched a beheading video  like do you understand  what that really is  and he's like  no no I can't watch that  I'm like you're going  where that shit happens  a reasonable option 
[02:13:00]  yeah that could  very well happen  if he saw one of the  I'm like if you  watched that video  you absolutely  would not go  what is it about him  he needs to  adventure that bad  I mean  he loves to travel  fly fishing is one thing  you can make fun  all you want  but I'm not in the  back country of Afghanistan  he's just not afraid  of people  and he just  he genuinely loves  different cultures  he doesn't go to be  a crazy adventurer  because he goes to  plenty of non  threatening things too  like he loves  Indonesia  he loves Muslim  culture and going  there  he's really weird 
[02:13:30]  he just loves to  travel  he loves France  he loves Spain  he loves everywhere  I hear Afghanistan  is kind of nice  he loves it  but he goes all the  way in the countryside  where the people  are hiding  yeah and he knows  a lot of very  interesting people  they're amazing  to talk to  when you hear people  who are actually  I told you his  friend Saad  I want to get on  the show  he runs the TV  station  in Afghanistan  he runs a couple  of different stations  and he has one  called Farsi 1  and they just  fucking into Iran 
[02:14:00]  in Farsi  they fire American  TV shows  and the Iranians  want to kill him  because he's fucking  playing Sex and the City  and all these shows  oh yeah they don't  want to show that  yeah he's got  balls of steel  I don't want them  showing that here  our country  his head lopped off  Jesus  but that's where  seeing a video like  that would be helpful  because you would  you would realize  that's a real thing  that's not something  that's a sound bite  on a news clip  I can't go there  I cannot go  poof  alright  I don't want to  disturb people  I really don't  it's just scary 
[02:14:30]  it's very scary  yeah  but the fact that  anybody would go to  Mexico  right now  you're crazy  to go there  to think that  it can't happen  yeah they're just  looking to kill  anybody  to make a little  noise  get some fear  those guys are  hardcore man  hardcore  alright  we'll break  I want to  talk to Anne  about the  Wall Street  protesters  the big protesters  man  yeah  Anne's got a cause  Anne's in the  middle of a cause  we're gonna  I just had nothing  to do  we're gonna  discuss it next  Sirius XM

[02:24:00]  for speed  you got no  idea  in regards  to speed  Harvey Fierstein  this is not a gay film  but it says in the script  we play volleyball  in jean shorts  that's pretty good  I say  Iceman's on my tail  he's coming hard  I literally said that  to a bathroom  attendant  how would I do it  no 
[02:24:30]  damn  this is great  son  your ego's  writing checks  your body can't cash  you know  that is a terrific line  I feel like  I understand  everything about this movie  just from the one line  that's good writing  I don't know  about airplanes  that's pretty good  that's very funny  get your damn  keys  off the  Iceman  requesting a flyby 
[02:25:00]  ghost  ghost  sinbad  take 35  35  you got to be  out of your mind  like that  what you got  brain damage  it was with girls  it's not doing  his stand up  all they do  is put on  a little dinner floss  like this  all the way  on the beach  somebody's  the only way  that peeps is at  Natalie from the  fact of the light  hey goose  you beat me  I'm Natalie  from the fact of the light  hilarious 
[02:25:30]  he's hiding  behind a light  he peeks around  it  and all of a sudden  a bird  on the windshield  what happens  what happens  I'm over  Afghanistan  I'm dropping  bombs  on Afghanistan  and a bird  takes a giant  on the windshield  what do I do  the last line 
[02:26:00]  in your movie  is  you can ride  my tail  anytime  guys  that's a good mantra  that's a very funny sketch  that was a good one  I could have done  some better impersonations  oh yeah  like who  whatever you want  um  let's just throw in  something  who would be like  something that would  really fit in 
[02:26:30]  in Top Gun  Rocky  at the time  like Sylvester Stallone  go ahead  they're gonna knock you  out of something  with your  with the plane wings  that's pretty good  actually  yeah yeah  that's great Chip  thanks  you're welcome  Top  I liked Iron Eagles  Chappie Sinclair was good  Chappie  climb high  play the tape  shut up  what was the tape  it was so bad  it was bad 80s music  did we have that  did we find that  on YouTube  where's Danny  climb high  play the tape  he's looking for 
[02:27:00]  ironing board eagles  trying to find  Radiohead from SNL  boo  yeah I want to know  what they played  I know  very eclectic  tickets go on  sale at 10  this morning  for their Roseland  show  I want to go  yeah I've already  put my  you're going  well I  I thought you said  you didn't like them  no I like Radiohead  they're just weird  they're weird  they're fucking  strange strange  people  did you  I watched their  performance  was it alright 
[02:27:30]  it was  I've heard them  better live  tell you the truth  I've heard them  better  I've never seen  them live  either  I mean I've  heard better  live recordings  of them  Travis  where are they  there  where  at Radio  whatever  at Groseland  I thought it  just goes on  sale now  Wednesday and  Thursday  yeah Wednesday  and Thursday  so it goes  on sale today  for Wednesday  Thursday  yeah because  they don't  want people  putting them  online and  selling them  for ridiculous  amounts of money  you gotta go  right in when  you pick up  your tickets  there's still  tons of ways  to get around  that though  at least  they're trying  that's pretty  smart 
[02:28:00]  like the plus  one gag  well yeah  the plus  one gag  I mean you  can always  just sell  your extra  ticket on  eBay which  is probably  the easiest  way to do  it but also  ticket brokers  now you  know they've  got back  doors to  yeah  so now  what I'm  seeing on  eBay is that  you can buy  their services  so I buy  the ticket  broker service  they will  ask you to  create a  ticket master  account  they will  pay with a  visa gift card  they will  overnight you  the visa gift  card and then  you have two  tickets 
[02:28:30]  so that's  that's a great  way for them  to sell two  tickets  so why  do they  fucking  why does  radiohead care  as much  it's like  that's pretty  ballsy to put  them on a couple  days before the  show  because where  they're playing  is an incredibly  small venue for  them to play  they're playing  Roseland  whereas they  usually can play  two nights at  Madison Square  Garden  oh can they do  two nights at  the garden  yeah they've  been doing two  nights at the  garden for years  yeah  I don't know  what the fuck  they do  they're just  too weird for  me  they are very  weird  radiohead played  Lotus Flower  and Staircase 
[02:29:00]  do you like  them  yeah absolutely  I'll try and  get tickets but  it'll be sold  out before it  even goes on  sale  so how about  Sirius XM get  us a bunch of  tickets  what's going on  with his  fucking eye  I would love to  go see them  what's his name  either  Tom  yeah  there's six  of them  he's got his  weird left eye  there's one guy  really  a little wacky  the genius  and then the rest  of the guys  Tom here  which one's he  Laszlo  a little bit  a little bit  what's he singing  hit play  for smashing  the teeth  commercials first 
[02:29:30]  oh no  ladies and  gentlemen  radiohead  it stinks  Jimmy will not  like this  no  no  he definitely  not  look how odd  he is  he's got maracas  and he's doing  the wacky  pee pee dance  this guy's  playing a  fucking  moog  no it looks  like he's  playing a  foosball table  are they good  musicians  oh yeah  he's grooving 
[02:30:00]  maracas  it's a little  black medical  book  I don't like  that  guitar  here we go  a little more  dancing  the beat itself 
[02:30:30]  is good  that's a cool  beat  guitar solo  do what you want  do what you want  do what you want  I wish me could  disappear  I was slipping to  breathe and cut me  out  I like this 
[02:31:00]  you do  hypnotic  I'm surprised by that  the beat is really cool  if you like this beat  you would like a lot  of their stuff  it's like a  mellow ramstein 
[02:31:30]  yeah I like  it's melodic  yeah  is this a popular  song  no  they don't  they don't have to  play popular songs  no  they go fuck that  shit  watch what we do  now  that's good right  yeah they haven't had  a giant hit in years  what's a big song  for them  well their biggest  song was Creep  oh that was  they're the original  saying that  oh fuck yeah  oh they're okay  but that was like  17 years ago  have they been around 
[02:32:00]  for that long  yeah they've been  around for a long time  do you think I  fucks a lot of girls  if he wants to  well he's married  but probably  in his day  sure  why are they doing  a small venue  just to do it  because they're in  town to do  Saturday Night Live  and the Colbert Report  and they haven't done  any gigs this year  why are they doing  Colbert  I don't know  they're probably  like an hour  yeah they're doing  a special hour long  episode with him  Colbert that's weird  why is Jon Stewart  doing Nirvana  and Colbert doing  what's going on  I don't know  but they're doing  like six songs for him  wow  they must love him  maybe they just like  they're probably fans  yeah I bet 
[02:32:30]  that's cool  someone said to me  do you want to do  something with Ozzy  like yeah okay  you can interview me  yeah that's how  I mean originally  they were just doing  Colbert and then  Saturday Night Live  and then  yeah  yeah why not  you just get to hang  with what you like  at Roseland  they're gonna be great  oh it's on  tonight's Colbert  Radiohead  okay  tonight  thank you to  oh Redding  Redding WB  checking in on Twitter  alright  I don't know much  about them  I want to know  what's another big song  that has a beat  like that  like  it gets a little weird  like  I could do without that 
[02:33:00]  but I like the  fucking beat itself  Karma Police  yeah  how's that Karma Police  this is the kind  of one that  everybody knows  this is back  when they were  still more of a  rock and roll band  gotta call the  Karma Police  or something  if you Karma  Chameleon  X up  it's nice  yeah you'd probably  like anything  off Kid A  Bands  yeah  the Bands  well  Kid A  you don't think so  you don't think  you would like  the Bands  as a rock album  sure but the stuff 
[02:33:30]  that he was enjoying  is more Kid A  Karma Police  arrest this man  he talks in the mouth  it buzzes like a fridge  it's like a ditch  he has a very good voice  yeah  yeah  really  a little odd  yeah  Karma Police 
[02:34:00]  arrest this man  he reminds me of  Cobain a little bit  yeah  a little bit  yeah  except he's not dead  gotta get to the  chorus  well whatever it is  it's not really  chorus  it's where it goes  like the Karma Police  the Karma Police  like the Dream Police  Dream Police  the Boob Police  this is what  you'll get  that cool piano  it's nice 
[02:34:30]  this is what  you'll get  this is what  you'll get  it's hard to dance  to Radiohead music  yeah  when you mess  with us  there you go  I like it  but this is  yeah  this is an oldie too  slow  yeah  it's not enough  great Joe Head  a lot of their stuff  sounds like it belongs 
[02:35:00]  to the end of a film  oh yeah  yeah  that could be  definitely  I don't know  is the guitarist  from Radiohead  did the score  for There Will Be Blood  yes  okay  Dave and Philly  thanks for that  they have a song  called Exit Music  for a film  oh they're pretty good  so I can  I wouldn't go  see them  but I mean  they sound pretty good  they've got a lot  of like heavier songs  I want to go  Travis  I have my  I have my request  in with some people  let's say  in the building  and  Rose Land 
[02:35:30]  yeah  yeah  it's a  venue  what building  related  what building  oh this building  that's terrific  that's terrific  I don't know  good luck with that  I got  I got an email  back  yesterday  yeah  or the day before  that said  hey  it's looking  really good  I have faith 
[02:36:00]  I have faith  you're gonna have to  pay for them  you know that  oh believe me  wait till you get the bill  that was in the email  no  I will absolutely  have to pay for them  really  yeah  the band might not  be doing comps  but I was  I was told  to please ask  once a week  for tickets  I have to go in  and ask  once a week  much like 
[02:36:30]  you know  Sam Roberts  would have to ask  for a raise  Sam a month ago  they begged  they begged me  personally to drop  the bit  because they're  working on it  that was a month ago  where are we at  a month later  how we doing  how we doing  a lot has happened  a lot has happened  since they begged  us to stop talking  about it  the thing about  finances  is very rude  to discuss  in public  you still don't  have a raise  it's such a rude  thing to discuss  finances in a public  place  holy shit  by the way  I wouldn't dream  of it  it's gonna be  shocking  but I just  wanna say 
[02:37:00]  that Howard Stern  is a fucking  genius  yeah  I really do  yeah  because  I think it's  people that  wanna just  fucking  twist the screws  but I'm getting  a lot of  pictures coming  in of Howard's  new studio  the new  and improved  studio  we've been  begging for  a new  studio  since we  got here  because this  was supposed  to be  temporary  and then  we said  alright  just get us  some lights  that we could  use and make  our videos and  pictures look  better  and we got  the sun lights  that we  joke about  giant lights  with no  not even a chance 
[02:37:30]  of a remodel  anytime soon  here  Howard is  suing  the company  which company  Sirius XM  satellite radio  that's the company  he works for  and this is why  he's a genius  how the fuck  did he get  this done  I have no idea  I'm looking at  a TV studio  it looks like  a game show  studio  this thing  looks amazing  and that's why  he's absolutely  a genius  how do you do  that  if we were  suing the  company  we would  be fired  Jedi mind  tricks  Robin 
[02:38:00]  I could  just see him  Jedi mind  tricking  everyone around  here  I need a new  studio  and then I'll  ask down the  hall and they'll  downplay it in  some way  and I'll have  to look him in  the eyes  and go  no you don't  understand  they're suing  you guys  and now he's  in a brand  new studio  that he's  bragging about  and he should  be  and everyone's  talking about  it today  yeah  and we got  lights that still  fucking don't  work properly  no they work  can you turn  them on for a sec  just for a second  I want to see  thanks Sam  you're right  I'm not sure  if you've ever  turned them on  Jesus Christ  that's really good  it worked 
[02:38:30]  Jesus  wow  that's good  well maybe we need  the other one on  that's only one  what a comfortable  lighting setting that is  this is great  see  this is great  if you're having  fucking like  surgery  let's see an  operating room  in here  it's the worst  lighting I've ever  seen  they say it's  not Jimmy  and it's better  to just agree  you can't look  into them  you can't even  look around them  you gotta keep  your head down  they're so bad  you got five  shadows alone  on the wall  there's shadows  all over the place 
[02:39:00]  but do they work  no they don't work  but we gave up  on that  we just gave up  not on doing  the radio show  but gave up  on hoping  that we  take care of  here  I'm just gonna  sit here  and get a tan  but that's why  Howard is certainly  a genius  oh wow  that's the studio  I don't even know  what his old one  looked like  what's the difference  yeah that's his  studio  he's a part-timer  now he'll even  admit it  you know  which is fine  he earned it  over the years  so he's a part-time  radio guy  that's suing the  company that just  got a state-of-the-art 
[02:39:30]  brand new  fucking studio  we would have  taken the old one  that he just said  you know what  this isn't good  enough  I don't like this  anymore  we would have  taken that one  video thing here  is new  look at the video  thing  the Howard Stern  thing behind is new  the couch is new  so that's why we  absolutely gotta leave  in a year  I can't live  it's the same  carpeting though  or just ask  Buckwald to handle  things because he  seems to get shit  done  yeah boy  he sure does  Buckwald seems  to get shit done  he sure does  he's hanging all  over the place  yeah  that's studio for 
[02:40:00]  a part-time guy  that's suing the  company  and that's why  he's a fucking  genius  most of the time  that studio is  the lights are out  no one's in there  right  maybe a mexican maid  vacuuming the rug  yeah  yeah  the cleaning people  see that place  more than Howard does  fuck  and this is not  jealousy by the way  so relax  I said he's a genius  yeah  if you turn off the  lights I'm seeing spots  hey mom look  the sun's here  why  we also got a studio  redesigned  can you please 
[02:40:30]  turn off the lights  it hurts  nobody wants a tan  oh  chip  these lights  are so bright  it's like having  two suns in a studio  shut up  and shouldn't the light  be over  it's like we're on  Tatooine  shouldn't the light  be over here  Ant  what  I can't see you  anymore  wait  what happened  I'm blinking  I see dots  the whole reason  for the lights  was so the guest  looks better  but all you would  you would make his  the back of his head  look better  yeah  I guess they're assuming 
[02:41:00]  if we take pictures  over here  right  that we could light  light it up  everything's good  it's really amazing  everything's good  I'll say  don't worry about it  I have a lot of light  holy mackinoli  I could use a couple  of those  hmm  I could definitely  use a couple of those  take these  we're not gonna use them  we can't use these things  stop  I can't  I keep looking  right into it  oh shut that  other one off  god  it's great  power down 
[02:41:30]  who's this  famous rap guy  who is that  I don't know  but he's got dreads  she already walked past  there used to be  some WB show  with these twins  Tia and Tamara  oh shit  you know who they are  sister  it's one of them  sister  I'll Tia Tamara  Jesus Christ  get it  it says I'll Tia Tamara  I said I'll Tia Tamara  ah  that's pretty good  I do wordplay stuff  in my act  that is  I need your act  it's good  stand up show  yeah  I open the show 
[02:42:00]  with scandals like that  yeah  Steve from Bayshore  of course  what  with a nice comment  about that  of course  fucking racist  all I have to say  I'm not gonna say  what this subject matter  was  or anything  I will assume  racist  no  I'm not gonna say  what it was  fair enough  but it was  Steve from Bayshore's  comment about it  had me laughing  so hard  said before the event  he gave four thumbs up  and 
[02:42:30]  I'm just gonna  fucking  leave it at that  and laugh  Steve is the best  he's so bad  what's that Sam  it's a video  of the new studio  oh  looks nice  is that up on the  serious site  I don't know  I just got it from  I guess we  I guess we  really shouldn't be  complaining at all  look at this  slow fucking  camera  like  they got a crane 
[02:43:00]  in there or something  yeah  there's a fucking  camera crane  they're doing  moving dolly shots  they have cameras  that look like  they're on train tracks  that just go around  the perimeter of the studio  they're called dollies  you cocksucker  sorry Hollywood  Jimmy  guy who overreacts  guy  guy who overreacts  guy  I love it  look at these shots  they're stunning  he's got a TV show  whatever  wow  that is amazing

[02:44:30]  his cutting edge  new brand of comedy  will have you in stitches  or have him in stitches  after you shove  that stupid wooden mallet  up his bony white ass  why don't  f***s fart  because they don't  get assholes  until they get married  it's racist Gallagher  live  I'm just being  cutting edge  I use these  across the country  I know what's funny  coming soon  to the Apollo Theater  one night only  because quite frankly  we don't think  there's going to be  a second night  I guess that's  what black people do

Fox  yeah  yeah  loved it  pretty good  yeah  definitely  except for  Susie Esmond  yelling and 
[02:46:00]  screaming again  that's her character  enough already  that's her gimmick  that's her gimmick  why does it have to be  her gimmick  year after year  like that  I don't know  because she's  supposed to be  that raging  cunt  but we're not  and we're supposed  to believe the guy  Jeff Garland  whatever his name is  yeah  his character  would stay with that  no  he just blows it off  yeah  he don't want to  lose all his money  right  yeah  I don't know  it doesn't bother  me as much  the Susie Esmond  yelling doesn't  bother you  no  why  because it's not  a giant part 
[02:46:30]  of every episode  and it's just  who she is  that's her character  it's you know  that's her dynamite  she gets  she gets that  worked up  that quickly  that Larry  she hates Larry  one of the dumbest  easiest things  yeah  did you see  you saw the  Michael J.

[02:52:30]  the number one  publicist excuse  yeah sick  someone's not feeling  too good  yeah what's going on  on Wall Street  you marching  with the protesters  I'm here  not really  Opie  not really  marching with them  no  on the Twitter  they're all over  the Twitter  talking about  their big protests  which were their  Occupy Wall Street  what are they trying  to get done  well  that's just it  you don't know  or  every tweet I've read  everything I've read 
[02:53:00]  they talk about  hey  we're down here  hey we're marching  hey we're playing guitars  hey we're filthy  jumping in fountains  that are disgusting  the police man  they have to  you know  they're being brutal  they're brutalizing  I don't read anything  about what they want  what they need  what they think  can be changed  does anyone know  they don't like  the greed man  of Wall Street  the greed man  they chant things like  we got left out 
[02:53:30]  they got a bailout  or something like that  and I don't know  I don't even know  what that means  I've been killed  by Wall Street  the last few days  Occupy  yeah thanks  Occupy Wall Street  is a leaderless  resistant movement  with people of many  colors, genders  and political persuasions  the one thing  we all have in common  is that we are  dirty armpits  part of the 99%  that no longer  tolerate the greed  and corruption  of the 1% 
[02:54:00]  now  see the 1%  the wealthy  the 1% by the way  that pays  like half the taxes  of this country  I'm sure  if you talk to  any one of those  little cock bags  down there  with this  Wall Street thing  none of them  have to pay taxes  I'm sure they fall  into that 50%  of the population  that don't pay taxes  get a refund  it must be nice  get a refund  things like that  yeah the 1%  that actually pay taxes 
[02:54:30]  and pay a fuckload  of taxes  but here's  the hypocrisy  in all this  they're down there  protesting  Wall Street  yeah  what happened  I don't know  did I do something  no no no no  I'm just reading  a tweet  I'm sorry  alright we'll get to that  yeah they're protesting  Wall Street  which is like  protesting the internet  it's like oh I hate  that internet  did you see some  of the stuff  that's on there  it's like yeah  but it's an entity  it's a big thing  it's not  you can't just say  Wall Street bad 
[02:55:00]  you know  and then they're  tweeting  they're taking  video  and photographs  and uploading it  to sites  all of these things  are publicly  traded companies  I'm sure they've  all got their  iPhones and  everything else  and Sony  video cameras  YouTube  Google  YouTube  Google  all that stuff  which is  publicly traded  they are the  most spoiled  rotten little  cock bags  that have a  complete lack  if any 
[02:55:30]  understanding  of what  Wall Street is  what capitalism  is  when they upload  their videos to  YouTube  they're making  Google money  yeah  yeah  exactly  so why are they  uploading anything  and you can email  them at their  Gmail address  at their  Gmail address  what rebels  what rebels  they are  and they  they show up  on Saturdays  and Sundays  and after  the markets  closed  so they never  really  confront  any of these  evil bankers 
[02:56:00]  I think they  expect the  guy from the  Monopoly  community  chest card  that fat guy  with money bags  to come out  with the cigar  and the bag  with the dollar  sign on it  one of the fat  cats  yeah the fat  cats  that's what they  don't like  they don't like  fat cats  and all of  their posts  are about  just come down  here and support  us  but they have  no cause  to support  so they're  walking around  and you know  they got a couple  of days where  the police  were  kind of 
[02:56:30]  keeping them  you know  under control  and the thing  that really  got me  is  they're talking  about revolution  and how  the Middle East  had their  whole thing  with Egypt  and Syria  and Libya  and you know  now it's our  turn  you see how  those protesters  in Syria  get treated  exactly  that site  I showed you  before  has a lot  of the Syrian  protesters  they're getting  their faces  shot off  shot off  and I watched  some videos  from this  occupation  of Wall Street 
[02:57:00]  and one guy  was crying  because he  he was resisting  arrest  first of all  they were trying  to get his hands  behind his back  and he was resisting  and then he's like  I can't breathe  I need my inhaler  and another kid  was complaining  because his cuffs  were on too tight  meanwhile  I was like  really  you're equating  yourself to what  happened in the  Mideast  where you would  sit there  and oh  my friend  that was next  to me  helping me out  a second ago  yeah  his brains  are all over  my face  right now  and yeah  an RPG  went right 
[02:57:30]  through him  but we're  just like  you man  and then  whenever the  cops would  do anything  to either  arrest somebody  move people  along  they'd start  chanting  the world  is watching  the world  is watching  like don't  pull any  shenanigans  meanwhile the  police were  saying please  move  thank you  could you  please clear  this out  and every  video that's  taken  they yell  and scream  ow  like they're  in pain  what the fuck 
[02:58:00]  is this girl  being arrested  yeah it's a bunch  of privileged  white kids  privileged fucking  suburban kids  yeah  and they're  occupying  wall street  they desperately  want to belong  to something  the way they did  in the 60s  and it's just  it's not there  they're desperately  trying to create  even though it's hard  to disagree with  hating wall street  but they don't know  what it is that  they even hate  about wall street  they think it's  just a bunch  of do you know  there's plenty  of businesses  that are publicly 
[02:58:30]  traded on wall street  where they have  a boss  and people  that are  under the boss  underlings  and the company  is trying to make  money  and trying to put  a product out there  for some people  and you know  trying to get  their stock price  up  not necessarily  fucking over  the people  and I think  that's a majority  of the companies  traded on wall street  then you get  the assholes  that are nothing  but greed  based  shit heads  and you know  you could  you could want 
[02:59:00]  to go after  them  but to  to occupy  wall street  and some of  these websites  they're sounding  like they're  an army  we're taking  over the park  are you  take it  yeah  but you  take it  a bunch of  homeless guys  that shit  themselves  you can have  that  want the jungle gym  have fun  asshole  watch out for the rats  we'll give you a tip  one of my favorite  parts as I was  reading  reading  and  and tweeting  insults to these  people  was  they're like  yeah the cops  were blockading  us 
[02:59:30]  from going to  the park  but we got  such numbers  now  they're  escorting us  to the park  and it's like  oh  and then I read  another tweet  that goes  a lot of  trucks  showing up  police trucks  and they have  those  orange snow  fences  you know  those  rubber  kind of  snow fences  they put up  temporary fences  yeah hanging  out there  sort of getting  a lot of chatter  on the police  radios and stuff  yeah they're  escorting us  to the park  they corralled  these idiots  together  all the better 
[03:00:00]  to arrest them  yeah  they got them  in there  you know  some kind of  and you can be  arrested for anything  believe me  obstruction  they just don't  let you  they could  pretty much  make up a charge  you know  you're in  you're in  my way  you're on  the street  you're  interrupting  with the  flow of  traffic  you're  disrupting  you're  disturbing  the peace  things like 
[03:00:30]  that  so they  arrest  people  and these  people are  they try  to not  move  on a dirty  New York  street  they got  balls to lay  in the  dirty  street  they don't  move  so the  police are  forced to  cuff them  and then  drag them  or carry  them away  and people  get angry  like why  are you  dragging  him on  the street  man  I think  this one  you might  have some  sound  that isn't  too bad  what's his  name  they're detaining  several  not sure  how many  and these  two bitches  up with the  camera  trying to get  everyone's  name  that's being  arrested  so they 
[03:01:00]  can get  legal counsel  the legal counsel  by the way  is sponsored  by bank of  america  no shit  ready  on three  one  two  three  what's  your  name  can't hear  shit  can't hear  shit  you  assholes  what's your  name  what's your  name  what's your  name  he's like  why are you  hurting me  why are you  hurting me  come on jason  jason  babies  jason wants your  last name  we need jason  babies  what's your name

[03:02:30]  worst at this  just one second  it's making me  too upset  you gotta say  something in the  middle east  they have  fucking  balls  they'll throw  rocks at a  tank  they are  fucking  ballsy  as the  tanks  are firing  at them  and they're  throwing rocks  but these  idiots  my cuffs  are  my fucking  zip strip  cuffs are  too tight  and his  pinky's  bleeding  and why  are you  dragging  him  they'll  got their  fucking  hipster  shit  on  yeah  they really  do  and you  know  man  they look  like a  bunch  of 
[03:03:00]  fucking  rich  kids  this  backpack  full of  shit  he bought  at the  apple store  which by  the way  is going  for four  dollars and  change on  the market  great  fucking  quarter  for a  it's amazing  400  yeah  uh  it's uh  but but  you know  they want to  be part  of a  movement  man  what is  the move  that's  that's  what do  they want  done  one said  end  capitalism  it's like  really  should we  do that  end  capitalism  yeah  is that  it  and uh 
[03:03:30]  then then  there was a  poignant  moment  very poignant  yeah  this young  african-american  gentleman  uh  came across  part of the  city bank  plaza thing  and dropped  to his knees  and said  and as he's  crying and  people are  taking pictures  of him  he goes  these  are the  this is the  peep  these are the  people  that took  my parents  house  and i  i had a  i had a tweet  really  really  are they the  people that  signed a  contract a 
[03:04:00]  mortgage  for more  than they  could afford  knowing that  it was more  money than  they could  afford  and the  bank  who by the  way didn't  take their  house they  took their  own fucking  house back  because it's  the bank's  money  uh  took the  house  yeah  sorry  charlie  i i am  more on the  side of the  protesters but i  just hate them  all so much  i can't be on  their side  the bank of  america is such  a repulsive  fucking organization  i've dealt with  them i think  they're terrible  they're they're  hard to like 
[03:04:30]  them all the  banks are  terrible they  give you shit  for your money  they uh  yeah  they in order  to get money  they they charge  you up the ass  for interest  more so than  they're getting  it's a loan  sharking business  it really is  and it's like i  just wish i  didn't hate  these fucking  i wish these  protesters were  fucking hardcore  i would like  them a lot  but they're not  and and what  they knew and  what they were  trying to do i  think more  importantly than  this cause  whatever the  fuck it was  supposed to be  was trying to  get video of  the mypd 
[03:05:00]  hitting some  kid uh the  most they got  was a pepper  spraying that  happened over  the weekend  which was  he fucking  larious  i didn't see  that  let's see  it was uh  this uh  a scuffle  was going on  and a bunch  of cops  kind of jumped  on this  kid  and the  girl  they had a  few girls  and other  people corralled  up on the  sidewalk  and they were  getting and  leaning over  the fence  and kind of  yelling at  the cops  and one cop  goes over  and under  his arm  kind of goes  and sprays 
[03:05:30]  fucking pepper  spray  see this  chick in  front  she gets  nailed right  in the face  and the  screams  of her  on her  knees  it's like  that fucking  girl in  Vietnam  that got  hit with  the napalm  you think  that's who  it was  and why  pd cops  just really  don't tolerate  this shit  no  they're fucking  good cops  man  they're great  cops  they understand  that they  can't really  go around  smashing heads  in  but they  keep control 
[03:06:00]  of a crowd  they know  how to  control the  crowd  before they  can get  out of  fucking  hand  and we  got the  other side  checking in  you do  you man  john in  rhode island  john  hey what's  going on  guys  guys first  i'm a huge  fan  been listening  for  all right  that's fine  of course  you're a huge  fan  dude anthony  it's like  the purpose  of these  protests  is to draw  attention  to the fact  that our  political system  is just too  wired into  corporate america  that's it  it's nothing  more than that  they may be  hipsters  they may be 
[03:06:30]  douchebags  but the point  of the fact  is we  aren't too  wired into  these guys  bullshit  so then why  not go against  the politicians  instead of the  fucking wall  street  i don't understand  the politicians  seem to be the  ones that are  supposed to  the politicians  are the ones  that are supposed  to be in there  serving the  people  the businesses  are there to  serve themselves  so why the  fuck get  hard on  against people  that are trying  to make money  that's their  job  we live in  a capitalistic 
[03:07:00]  society  the people  on wall  street  yeah  there's some  scumbags  on there  but you know  what  their job  is to make  money  for the  stockholders  that's never  been a secret  it's not a  scam  they're trying  to make money  some of them  do it very  underhandedly  and scumbaggishly  but that's their  job  the politicians  on the other  hand  are there to  serve the  people they  represent  so go to  washington  and march  on those  motherfuckers  or when  when the  election rolls  around  get off your  fucking ass  like you went  to wall street  and vote 
[03:07:30]  and maybe try  to change  something  we get that  but you know  what it's a  low-hanging fruit  kind of thing  what  the man's  jamming your  system  he's jamming  your signal  man  your phone's  crapping up  bro  but i  what do you  say it makes  a little bit  of sense  i mean  they are too  tied in  i do  agree  and i'm  i just  don't  my problem  is this  i have  an intense  dislike  of the 
[03:08:00]  type of  person  protesting  although in  theory i  pretty much  agree with  what they're  saying  i agree  peter  have some  pumpkins  or something  we're so  sick of the  bullshit  you're telling  us we have  to go to  complain to  this guy  to that  guy  we're sick  of the  guy that's  jamming  his fist  up our  ass  who's  that  the banks  and the  mortgage  what's  30 year  mortgage  that's  all  your  life  if  you're  rich  and you  can get  a million  dollars  or  you're  paying a quarter

[03:12:30]  do you think so many  jobs have gone  overseas  why do you think so  many jobs have gone  overseas  because why wouldn't  a company pay a  Chinese person  two dollars an hour  as opposed to  somebody that wants  to sweep a floor  twenty five dollars  an hour  and then someone's  supposed to buy a car  that costs  eighteen times more  than they could buy  one foreign  because the fucking  union workers  that sweep the floors  at the plant  demand twenty five  thirty dollars  an hour  American guys  that went to 
[03:13:00]  school with you  it's us  the union workers  it's us  man your friends  are getting fucked  up the ass  okay  but these rich  cocksuckers  and these rich  cocksuckers  are supposed to pay  twenty five  to thirty dollars  an hour  for a laborer  for a laborer  yeah they got  millions  building a company  and fucking  the rest of us  over  fucking the rest  over  they're paid a wage  to fucking  go to work  the boss  will make more money  than the worker 
[03:13:30]  that's the way  it's been forever  you want it differently  you want the boss  to shill out  all his money  everyone wants  just you know what  invade everyone's house  then  please start with mine  try to take my money  could you please do that  please come to my house  and try to take my money  because I swear to fuck  I'm waiting for that  but Anthony  I don't want to be starving  I work sixteen hours a day  I can't afford  yeah yeah  some people work sixteen  some work four  the world needs  ditch diggers too  you know  well I do what I can 
[03:14:00]  I'm not as talented  as you are  but guess what  I want to have  some kind of a life too  well then work at it  try to fucking  get some kind of life  no one's gonna  give it to you  fuckhead  or any of these  other shitheads  I've been working  all my life  yeah  and you know what  you might  and you know what else  you might never make it  there's not a guarantee  to wealth  in this country  and so what  I'm a regular person  I still have  I still have a right  to a good 
[03:14:30]  decent life  of course you do  you have the right  to life  liberty  and the pursuit  of happiness  there's nothing in there  saying you have the right  to my money  or anyone else's  fucking wealth  yes you do  I don't  bitch Anthony  keep your freaking money  oh yeah keep my money  until Obama wants  to tax the fuck  out of me  and give it to  you know  other people  to bring them up  to a closer level  to stop the wealth  disparity  that's going on  in this country  I'm supposed to  cough up some of my cash  and give it to someone 
[03:15:00]  who doesn't have as much  how about the 50%  of the people in this country  that don't pay taxes  stop paying  this guy sounds like  he's talking about  the guys like  the CEOs  it's all relative  but like the guys  who are taking  five  three  $300 million payouts  like they're taking  hold on bro  like the guys  that are  the guys that are  the guys that are  like I don't  like I agree  with both of you  like I know exactly  what Ant is saying  and I completely  agree with him  but this guy  I think is talking  more about  it's like the government 
[03:15:30]  is fucking bailing  these companies out  and these scumbags  are taking  $80 and $100 million  payouts  these fucking people  are murderable  yeah  so you would have  had a lot more  that could feed  a thousand of us  yeah  you'd have  you'd have  a lot more people  you'd have  a lot more people  down there  if everybody  that works  at General Motors  was unemployed  because there was  no bailout  but yeah  I see that point  these cocksuckers  are taking chumps  like you wouldn't  believe it  we're over here  stretching our guys  eyes out for $20 
[03:16:00]  what the fuck  right  and how many  how many companies  do you see doing that  fucking  American companies  right now  have the most cash  in their hands  well that's okay  well you know what  then  how about you  invest in that  great solar energy  company that Obama  gave half a billion  dollars to  oh that's right  I can't afford  to pay the fucking  electric  I got two kids  and I want  69  that's a shame  my fucking pool's  up to 84 degrees  running my electric  heater  for $3,000 
[03:16:30]  fucking electric  bill that I laugh at  have fun  but the guy's  trying to do  the right thing  you're going after  the wrong guy  no I'm not  he works 16 hours  a day  what else is he  supposed to do  I could give a shit  about his 16 hour  day  I could give such  a little shit  about his 16 hour  work day  I worked for a living  my whole fucking  life  I worked for a living  like a dog I worked  I made shit money  my bosses were  assholes  that drove around  in fucking Ferraris  and Bentleys  and I worked my 
[03:17:00]  balls off  and made shit  but you made it out  it's one in a million  that makes you out  like that Anthony  oh well  oh well  how about that  you know what I did  I fucking was able  to work with what I  had  knock on a few  doors  and made something  of myself  I took stock  of myself  I labeled  I wrote down  my good points  and my bad points  I guarantee  which side  had a lot more  shit written on  hey Peter  Peter 
[03:17:30]  alright Peter  before you go  we know  we know  could you say  earthquake warning  I like Peter  he didn't seem  like he was  being irrational  or begrudging you  but he's a pumpkin  eater  he really is  and he won't  stop eating them  Peter  hey how's Bobby  and Cindy  but he didn't seem  like he was  begrudging people  there  he wasn't  he wasn't  one of these  kids talking  about  anyone making  200,000  should give  half their money  back  but he is 
[03:18:00]  I know  these people  he's not  going to say  that  but the whole  group of people  that are protesting  their whole  group mentality  is that  anybody  that has  attained wealth  in this country  has done it  through the means  of fucking  over the little  guy  absolutely  anybody  with money  they're like  hey we're  the 99%  they want to  call themselves  that  and then  the 1%  that pay  for this 
[03:18:30]  entire  fucking  country  without the  1%  by the way  you 99%  you'd really  be in the  shitter  there'd be  no roads  left  but a guy  working 16  hours a day  shouldn't have  to worry  about paying  his bills  at that  point  no  yeah  that does  suck  doesn't it  it's not  fair  maybe  you could  change the  world  and also  Peter shows  how god damn  great we are  at this  because he's  struggling  but he still  has that  serious  xm in his  car  he certainly  does  thank you  Peter  it's like  a guy like  that I think  is not  it's  the people  he's talking  about  I agree 
[03:19:00]  with  I don't like  the fact  that anybody  who makes  money should  pay 50  that makes  me sick  but these  guys that  are taking  these bailouts  and accepting  this fucking  parachute money  that they take  it just happened  just because  it's Obama's  company  same thing  big business  is big business  the only answer  and I would  never encourage  I will say  this  I would love  to see  certain people  dragged into  the street  and not these  dumb hippies  but the guys  that are taking  80 million dollars  I would love  to see them  dragged in 
[03:19:30]  the street  and have  street justice  performed  they are  people who  are really  fucking  all of us  and not  trying to make  money for their  stockholders  because I agree  with you  just because  you're a big  company  and you make  a lot of  money  does not  mean you're  evil  you're trying  to make  some money  for your  stockholders  you go  overseas  because people  here want  30 bucks  an hour  to sweep  the floor  that's not  evil  but some  fucking guy  taking a  bailout  and then  fucking  accepting  60 million  it's like  it's much  killable  when the  company takes 
[03:20:00]  a tax  fucking  paid for  bailout  and  then they  turn around  and give  executives  huge bonuses  with that  money  that is  deplorable  I understand  that  but that  isn't  an epidemic  that is  happening  that demands  Wall Street  be inconvenienced  by a bunch  of the great  unwashed  that's  what I'm  talking about  and again  believe me  I saw  this  I've been  keeping tabs  on this  for a while 
[03:20:30]  now  they have  a hatred  for anyone  that is  living comfortably  in this country  and they think  that like I said  everybody that is  wealthy  made their money  on the backs  of the little  guy  and fucked  them in the ass  and they're not  given a chance  because  meanwhile  what they're  rebelling against  also are their  parents  because most  of their  parents  are considered  wealthy  they come  from good  houses  but just  because  you're a guy  who made  no money 
[03:21:00]  and then made  a lot of money  so you understand  you have a  particular  fucking hatred  for people  trying to  fucking put  their hands  in your  pockets  I lived in  my car  bitch  which I  certainly  it's a lot  different than  being born  into money  but there is  a legitimate  point to the  fact that  there are  people who  really are  working hard  and just  not getting  what they  should get  and it's  like I  know life  sucks  but I do  feel  something  for those  people  I had  one guy  that said  because I  commented  on that  guy that  said that  the bank  took his  parents  house  and then  I commented 
[03:21:30]  on it  and the guy  said are you  serious  he goes  you know  what  the house  that he's  paying like  $1,700 a  month for  for a mortgage  and it's  now worth  $100,000  which is a  third of what  he bought  it for  he goes  why should  he still  pay for  a house  that dropped  in value  and I was  trying to  make the  point  a house is  also an  investment  and it's  not guaranteed  that it's  going to keep  going up  you dumb  fuck  and you're  still  obligated to  pay the  fucking  mortgage  it's just 
[03:22:00]  the way the  banks have  and again I'm  making a very  broad statement  but they have  such a  fucking  rigged  game  it's like  I just  dumped a CD  that I had  I had like  40 grand  for I don't  know how  many years  and I made  $230 in  interest in a  year on like  a 40,000  and I'm  like you  fucking  pigs  like the  amount you  charge people  it is  loan shark  it's not  like  why do  we even  have our  money in  the bank  at this point  I look at  my statement  every month  sickening  I'm not  making shit  they're sickening  fucking people 
[03:22:30]  and it's like  why do we  even do it  no  people  and people  that don't  understand it  think that  because you  have money  that you  just put it  in the  bank  and you  live off  the interest  like it's  fucking  1970  something  no it  doesn't  happen  like that  anymore  you're  actually  your money  is losing  value in  the bank  because it's  not keeping  up with the  inflation rate  which is much  higher percentage  than the  point fucking  2% you're  getting in the  bank  and even  though there  was a lot  of bad  loans given  out  and that  guy's  parents  might have  been total  shitheads 
[03:23:00]  but I feel  for people  who just want  to achieve  the dream  of having  a house  because the  people giving  the money  they know  so much  more  than the  people they're  giving it to  and it's  not a  fair  playing  but let me  tell you  something  there is  always  the point  where you  look at  your contract  and you  say I  need this  much per  month to  get this  house  and you  know if  you can  afford it  or not  and a lot  of these  people sign  that fucking  paper knowing  they could  not afford  the mortgage  or thinking 
[03:23:30]  they can  but not  foreseeing  the way  the interest  rates were  going to  change  but the  guy who's  allowing  them  I'm not  saying that  they shouldn't  have to give  the house  back  but the  bankers  they know  what's going  to go  on with  the interest  they can  look at  this and  go yeah  you're fine  for five  years and  then you're  fucked  and most  times they'll  know that  or at least  they'll suspect  it but I  guarantee you  they don't say  that to the  person  they're not  doing honest  banking like  where they're  trying to help  the customer  and guide the  customer  they're not  I just had a  fucking mortgage  closeout problem  they're fucking  assholes  they're terrible  I believe you 
[03:24:00]  but then again  you know you  gotta be educated  you have to have  people look over  your contracts  and explain them  to you  you don't just  walk in and go  I want that  house because  I like it  how much is it  oh I don't  know if we  could afford  that  it's like  anything else  you take out  a car  payment right  you buy a car  and you take  you make  payments  all of a sudden  your car is  worth less  because you've  had it for a  year  do you stop  making the  payments  oh wait 
[03:24:30]  my car didn't  go up in  value  fuck this  I'm not gonna  make the  payments anymore  they took my  car  but they do  take advantage  of the human  weakness  that's fucking  terrible man  there are people  like fuck  that's why  everyone's in  credit card debt  yes I understand  before I had  money I fucking  bought shit  I didn't fucking  it's called  living beyond  your means  we all do it  I did it  of course  of course I did  it  but let me tell you  here's the  difference  here is the  difference  I was not  bitching  after I fucked  myself over 
[03:25:00]  with credit  cards  that someone  ought to  pay this  or that  why did they  send me this  card  or why  is the  interest  I knew  what the  interest rate  was  it's ludicrous  I know  what the  fucking  monthly  minimum  payments  were  yet I  spent too  much  the difference  is I  didn't fucking  get with a  bunch of  other idiots  that did  the same  thing  and start  marching  and trying  to find  anyone by  myself  to blame  it isn't  the people  who make  money  like I  don't  think  all stock  brokers  are bad 
[03:25:30]  a lot  of even  the big  ones  are  fucking  guys  who just  know how  to play  the market  but it's  the other  stuff that we  all know  goes on  it's the  fucking  the lack  it's the  protection  of information  that only  they have  they're not  doing stuff  in good  faith  and we've  all negotiated  things that  were not  being done  in good  faith  by the  other side  and you  see how  enraging  that is  when you  negotiate  and they're  not showing  you good  faith  it's like  man you're  making  40 grand  a year  and a  bank is  doing that  I don't  know how  more citizens  out there  I mean I'm  lucky I can 
[03:26:00]  fucking pay  my bill  I don't  know how  more people  don't fucking  do very  very harsh  things to  these people  yeah  we're sheep  and we'll  always be sheep  and this  whole thing  is this  Occupy Wall  Street thing  is just  one of these  silly  it's just  silly  you want a  revolution  start revolting  and don't  worry so much  that your  cuffs are too  tight or you  know you lost  your inhaler  you know  they knew  when they saw 
[03:26:30]  the NYPD  they fucking  knew that  you don't  fuck with  those people  the NYPD  if you start  getting out  of line  they will  fucking crack  your heads  open and  it will be  justified and  no grand jury  will indict  them because  you're really  trying to like  make a problem  and I think  they knew that  and that's why  they didn't  want to you  know start  any real  shit  no it's a  peaceful  protest  yeah okay  because you're  scared fuckless  we need a  third party  it's so corny  and trite to  say that 
[03:27:00]  it's true  yeah  but it's like  this is what  the guy  because Obama  is as liberal  and anti-Wall  Street as you  can get  and I kind  of like the  fact that  somebody's  anti-Wall  Street  but he's  in a bunch  of trouble  now  even him  it happens  to  it's like  it doesn't  matter  he's also  going to  hold hands  with those  fucking Saudis  he's also  going to get  fucked by  big  they're all  going to  no matter  how liberal  or conservative  you are  that shit's  going to happen  that solar  energy company  they're all  pleading the  they're all  pleading the  fifth  they made  visits to  the White 
[03:27:30]  House  they had  a half a  billion dollars  in taxpayer  money  and just  weeks before  they filed  for bankruptcy  they were  telling people  how great  they were  doing  yeah this  is fantastic  we're doing  fine  and there's  all these  people involved  that got  these little  meetings  and favors  and shenanigans  went on  and they're  trying to see  how close  it gets  to the  White  House  and so  far  it's pretty  fucking  close  this is  one of  those  scandals  that 
[03:28:00]  again  if it  was a  Republican  or Bush  in there  and stuff  this would  be  you know  they were  yelling  Halliburton  Halliburton  out the  ass  during that  whole  fucking  escapade  what about  this  no liberal  is saying  anything  about Obama  being connected  to this  but as  annoying  as these  protesters  are  and they  are  annoying  that  fucking  they don't  get the  anger out  of me  that that  fucking  people like  getting that  kind of  money  and then  stealing  it  fucking  pulls out  of me  that pulls  out  of me  I don't want  to see  these protesters  killed  but I would  like to see  the people 
[03:28:30]  steal it  like Bernie  Madoff  the fact  that they  put these  guys  in these  can they  stop  with the  fucking  minimum  security  for someone  that stole  a billion  dollars  from  Holocaust  charities  why is that  fucking  piece of  shit  in a  soft  he should  literally  although I don't  think gang  members would  beat him up  because he  literally is  the ultimate  he stole  a billion  fucking  dollars  that's the  ultimate  gangster  really  I don't  think  no matter  how  hardcore  you are  he should 
[03:29:00]  be in  a horrible  place  not a nice  place  so what  you're suggesting  that these  guys should  get their  bread  helmets  and really  start  revolting  and start  revolting  get the  bread  helmets  and then  a little  more  respect  from you  be  revolting  be  revolting  tonight I  have to  plug  two  yes  please  John Amos  play  I am  going  yes  it's  830  115  McDougal  Street  at the  Players  Theater  tickets  I think  are available

[03:33:00]  let me find the guy's name  because it made me laugh  yeah  his name was uh  C90 is his Twitter name  okay  and he wrote uh  extreme chipping  bonus points for making chip jokes  to old high school friends  celebrities or women  you're about to fuck  and that just really made me  extreme chipping  oof  do you know the interns  you know what I meant  that's Matt  and that's Sal  hi Matt  Matt's a  Matt's a creep  hi Sal  why do you think  Matt's a creep  I've met Chip 
[03:33:30]  Ant has already  gone on the air  and said that his first day  he was giving Ant  like a creepy  starstruck  big fan type look  and then  it's alright  he has a Bobo mouth  he smiles at Bobo  you do have curling lips  do I?  you took Bobo  to a Mets game?  curling lips  he does  yeah they're curling  around a cookie  or something  why would you step over Chip?  what's that?  he stepped over you  he was talking about Bobo  while you were trying  to do a joke  oh sorry go ahead  nothing from Chip

[03:34:30]  sorry there was a manager  manager here  there was a man  he almost said  there was a management here  there was a management  what are you tripping on  I don't know  I just spend you on  an all expense  paid trip to Mexico  hope your head gets cut off  and you get killed  that's so real  why would you  I don't know  there's no humor value to that  that's horrible  I just hope they kill him  cut his head off  why?  that's not even funny  that's like  you just want a guy to die?  yeah  I want him to chop  he rocks head off  and then make him say  they're chopping my fat head off 
[03:35:00]  in Spanish  so angry  they kill him  they kill him  I mean  your YouTube videos  I know I'm ruining your show  right now too by the way  and it's really making me happy  you're not  I mean  people like Chip  they don't like him this much  your YouTube videos  are doing well  they're not doing well  nobody watches them  I don't care though  it's not for that  I mean people don't  people one day  will understand  oh there's no views  but I laughed out loud  watching it  at some of the fucking  the nonsense  really made me laugh 
[03:35:30]  everybody that I've talked to  likes them better long  oh really?  yeah  because I think Chip  is a special case  where I think Chip  does better long  because it's like  how  because it's just  the whole idea  is not quick  quick quick  it's like  he does this  for extended periods of time  do you think the fact  that he said  the green with envy joke  eight times hurts?  yeah  exactly  and if you can really  hammer that home  like if you can fit  the same joke in  three times in a video  and the whole  the french fries hat  I think this is what 
[03:36:00]  Penn Jillette thought  I was making fun of  comic-con people with  because he might have  because the tonight show  bit I did at comic-con  didn't mock them  it was pretty nice to them  yeah  but I literally think  that he saw this  and thought that I was  doing this to mock  and it's like  no this is who Chip is  yeah  Chip's an unfunny guy  and he bombs  everywhere he goes  he's angry  and he thinks that  yeah  and he says mean stuff  and it makes people  uncomfortable  he thinks of women  as sexual objects  yeah  we gotta put  we gotta go to  comic-con in New York 
[03:36:30]  you wanna do another  one of these?  more than I wanna breathe  nice  I wanna do another  one of these  I know people  wanna see it  there'd be too many  I don't want too many  fucking Chip fans  it's like you know  not that there'll be  a lot of them  but there'll be more  people that know me here  yes Yoke?  one of the lower tiers  is just a whole forum  of people who are  just into anime  the Japan stuff  Chip loves anime  yeah  that's the perfect place  for you to go  oh okay yeah  they don't know the show  they don't know any  pop culture shit  they're just into that  Japan style of animation  I hate that fucking style  oh 
[03:37:00]  fucking repressed weird culture  it's strange  octopus with eight dicks  fucking a girl  while she bleeds  from her school socks  terrible  fucking savages  why don't you just have  fucking a bunny  jumping around  yelling what's up doc  yeah I mean  in America  we don't sexualize  our cartoons  no  we don't have cartoon porno  although  America's weird  because when you look  at like Shirley Temple  they said had a weird  sexual effect on people  really  yes  I certainly don't see it  but there was more to her  than just being cute 
[03:37:30]  there was a fucking weird  sexual vibe to that  I don't know why we don't  think pedos existed back then  but they did  well  I think a lot of people  saw Shirley Temple  without the sexual  element to it  oh  it's a foreign concept  to you  alright well I'll go  you enjoy your show  alright well  oh wait wait wait  Hotline  don't go yet  who's this  Hotline  you better put it down  so you don't  burn your hands  with that  you're on the air  does Lyle need a ride home  yeah where are you 
[03:38:00]  are you still down  in the place  or what  yeah I'm waiting  for you Lyle  oh I thought you were  still getting Anthony's  car truck  no  it's time to go Lyle  I'm gonna come down  right now  alright thank you Lyle  okay stop calling me that  I'm Chipper  bye Lyle  stop it  you stupid voice  Sally Frankenstein  you don't like club soda  no  stupid  bye Lyle  wow  Chip does a good club 
[03:38:30]  instead of Kenny  hey Lyle  wow  alright well  you can go  Chip  yeah sometimes Kenny  hits me  he does  stay tuned  the after show's next  Opie and Anthony  have left the building  but the ONA show  continues  sort of  after ONA live  is next  on the virus  Sirius XM  XM  the virus 
[03:39:00]  Sirius XM  hey hey hey  and now  the Opie and Anthony  show continues  this is after ONA live  here's your host  Sam Roberts  Chip went home  started Opie and Anthony  it's after Opie and Anthony  live with Sam Roberts  that's what the production said  and it said that for a reason  because that's what it is  I mean  it's an amazing thing  because based on that last break 
[03:39:30]  the Occupy Wall Street deal  oh here comes Sal the intern  Sal where'd you find that table  where'd you find it  in the fishbowl  Eric you were right  you see we were missing a table  and it was in the fishbowl  Eric how do you feel  I feel vindicated  so does that mean they used it for Nirvana  I guess so  every time stuff's missing from our studio  it's always in the fishbowl  there's just  there's some little elves 
[03:40:00]  that come in here at night  and just move things from our studio  into the fishbowl  well what use could they have had  for our stuff in the fishbowl  well usually  you know and it's fine  usually the Ron and Fez guys  use it for Unmasked  or whatever they're doing  in the fishbowl at the time  that makes sense  but this wasn't a Ron and Fez thing  so we were trying to figure out  well where the hell  did all this stuff go  how'd they get in here  I guess Friday  or Saturday morning  they just opened up  and go hey  O&A have some extra stuff  that we can use  but the studio's locked  yeah I'm sure other people  have keys to it  what's the purpose of having 
[03:40:30]  it's locked  when I get here on Saturday  what's the purpose of  so yeah  so the table was  over in the fishbowl there  so I guess they used it  for Nirvana  well at least it's a famous table now  I wish they should have  gotten it signed  or something  but that last break  that Occupy Wall Street break  what's amazing  is that Ant  was sitting here  during the break  and specifically said  he didn't remember  when the last time  he was this tired  for a show was  and he was great  the whole show  but I mean obviously  that you know  Monday morning  getting over the weekend 
[03:41:00]  feeling it gets  greater and greater  as the show goes on  what do you think  Roland  Roland  Sam we're not going  towards the cliff  though are we  and Paul  he thought his bike was on  what's up Roland  Anna Kendrick's  is going to come by  Sam  huh  Anna Kendrick's  is going to walk by  Sam  who's Anna Kendrick's  did you see  they're up there  huh  the George Clooney movie  up in the air  you said  they're up there  they're up there 
[03:41:30]  hey they're up there  up there  no up in the air  oh  is she coming in here  I don't know  I just get to watch  her walk by  yeah  okay  I guess that's like  having a guest  but  she's in the 50-50  oh the  the cancer movie  with Seth Rogen  and  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  and Joey Gordon-Levitt  oh it's Joseph now  I know Mr. Ruck from the Sun  and Angels in the Outfields  Joey Gordon-Levitt  but Ant like  he was  he came alive  during the end of the show  the guy was exhausted  he was  he wanted to sleep  during the commercial breaks 
[03:42:00]  and immediately  the show comes back on  especially when you start  talking about  Occupy Wall Street  and the man  comes alive  what was your question  Matt the intern  who's just sitting in here  um  are we going towards  a clip show  what would I be going  playing clips  of what just happened  hasn't it been like  three weeks without a clip  no it hasn't been  three weeks without a clip  if you play a clip  it counts as a clip show  what are you talking about  why would I play a clip  of what just happened  on the show  I'm talking about  something that happened  five minutes ago  I thought that's where  I was headed 
[03:42:30]  Eric am I recapping a show  or am I playing a clip  should we play  I have no clue now  I'm totally lost  you know what  Matt was saying  as a matter of fact  remember when Chip  was in here  right before  do we have that  ready to go  yeah I can pull it  give me a minute  because we should play  what is going on here  Paul  do you see why I hate him  like seriously  he hasn't warmed up on you  no not really  Eric  yeah  you're gonna have  more control over these  guys  I see that  I mean where's Sal  Sal is in here  he's hanging by the phones  in case somebody calls  oh Sal's working

[03:44:00]  studio  they're doing a  show right now  and you're ruining  it  okay Eric  okay  so why are you  still sitting here  mic still on  headphones off  oh he pushed  the mic out of the  way  keep going  bye  follow Sal  Sal  can you hold  the door open  for him  Matt you're  welcome back  anytime your  boss lets you  thank you  you can just  leave the building  actually  oh no  that's not what  it is  come here  you can take  this seat

[03:45:00]  oh  now it's you  but you did  um  yeah I was  just trying to  make a point  about Ant  coming alive  like that  like that guy  well I tried  to stay on it  but the last  guy who wrote  to me got  thrown out of  here Roland  if you'd like  to join him  throw me out  I can't  I can't  I don't have  the physical  power or  I don't stand  above you  I don't have  any right  to do that  but nevertheless  I just tried  to talk about  you know  and out of 
[03:45:30]  nowhere you know  and then  this guy  I think this  dude's here  for the fucking  wrong reasons  Sal is setting  a good example  of what an  intern should  be like  he works  this dude  fucking  busts his  balls man  and he's  there and  he's always  asking at the  end of the  day what  else do you  need  what else  do you  need  this other  fucking  clown  the other  day when  Sal was  trying to  show him  something  at my  desk  and he  just wanted  to fucking  talk about  Bobo's  Twitter  is that  true Sal  I got  something  he went  to the  Mets game  this week  with Bobo  he told me  about it  he did  why 
[03:46:00]  I don't  know he  told me  all about it  we didn't  we didn't  we make  fun of  Kurt Love  for hanging  out with  Bobo  too much  I feel  like it's  hypocritical  we can't  make fun  of Kurt Love  yeah and  guess what  Sal did  what  he just  stayed here  and worked  all day  he just  stayed here  and worked  Saturday  Sunday  he was  in here  working  I saw him  he just  woke up  from the  couch  he goes  I'm here  I'm committed  well  I mean  I guess  we're hanging  out with  Bobo  then right  I mean  what does  that tell  you about  the dude  oh and  he asked  Troy  about his  eating habits  you know  he's one of  those people  that's just  like 
[03:46:30]  you just  don't know  your place  yet  you just  have to  always  be  commenting  about  something  what do  you mean  it's just  like  hey Troy  you eat  a lot  of junk  food  well  because  Roland's  like  oh I  ate  White Castle  I was  like  oh I  love  White Castle  and he's  like  oh you  eat a lot  of fast  food  I'm like  it's fast  food  Friday  yeah once  a week  I have  fast food  you're allowed  to treat  yourself  every now  and then  it's just  one of those  stupid comments  it's like  dude shut  the fuck  up  Troy  he juices  that's why  he's so fit  you're a Casanova  you're a guy  who has been  with a lot  of women  you're a guy 
[03:47:00]  who slings  a lot of  cock around  I don't know  about that  Club Soda Kenny  told me  in those words  keep your feet  using girls  and say thighs  yeah  yeah I think  that is true  well I figured  it was with  jizz rolling  you could have  used a little  subtlety there  but I've seen  you walk down  the halls  and the girls  turn their heads  this is kind  of the life  of Troy  what did you  think of  did you hear  about the  Justin Bieber  Selena Gomez  date that we  talked about  on the show  yeah  what did  you think  that's pretty  fucking cheese  Bush league  yeah it's just 
[03:47:30]  it's unnecessary  you know what I mean  like if you're  Justin Bieber  you have all that  money of access  to everything  right  I don't know  if you have  to do that  like it's not  like impressive  because of course  you can rent out  like if I rented  at the Staples  Center  Jess would be  like that's  amazing  how'd you pull  that off  you asshole  where we live  now  yeah exactly  well Jess  you're gonna be  covering rent  for a few months  but if Justin  Bieber did it  it'd be like  yeah of course  you can  you're Justin  Bieber  like you  performed here  well that  date reminded  me that we  never played  audio from  Bobo's date  is that gonna 
[03:48:00]  happen  I figure maybe  I'll just play  it right now  as a matter  yeah  if Travis and  Danny want to  come down  because they were  at the date  too  and they could  anybody wants  to fill in  because Travis  and Danny  said  there's Travis  already  I've never seen  him get here  that quickly  um  I've never seen  him get here  that quickly  no you guys  are talking  about Justin  Bieber  oh oh  you got  Bieber  I just want  I just want to  bring up a point  like everybody's  saying you know  like oh it's  screams of  desperation or  it's a little  cheesy but we  gotta remember  he's 17 years 
[03:48:30]  old  we were talking  about it on the  show he's got a  little dick still  yeah so just think  about like when you  were 16 or 17  like what would  you do if you  had millions of  dollars  oh I'd rent out the  Staples Center and  watch a movie  or you'd buy  you'd get Mr.  Deeds and be like  that's a good ass  idea  exactly so like  so yeah it's  it's stupid but  he's a kid he's  not like he's not  like 30 years old  you know do you  think we should  illustrate like how  other dates have  gone by finally  playing these Bobo  date clips I mean  that that's up to  you Bobo's not  really you know  Bobo's not gonna 
[03:49:00]  contribute to it we  have the recordings  here I mean I had  to go on this date  with them with Bobo  and Jackie like a  week ago Bobo had  to win a date with  Bobo game the Bobo  dating game whatever  you want to call it  and Bobo ended up  going on a date with  this girl Jackie who  was like seven levels  out of Bobo's  league at least  seven yeah and I  mean my levels are  big levels I don't  know if you go by  smaller like big big  avenue blocks exactly  like she was so far  out of Bobo's league  I mean she was out  of most of our  leagues so one so 
[03:49:30]  one regular level  would be three Bobo  levels yeah yeah  yeah yeah but Bobo  got the chance to  date her he was  disappointed at the  result of the game  because one of the  other girls Courtney was  actually nicer to him  than this chick Jackie  was that's why Jackie  won now I gotta ask  question now I know  we didn't set it up  yet so we don't know  exactly who's there and  exactly what's going on  at this table but I  guess it wouldn't be a  big surprise to just  say that the loser of  this contest the second  girl yeah she tagged  along yeah I mean  because we felt bad for 
[03:50:00]  her what's her name the  other girl invited yeah  oh yeah and Jackie was  like Courtney why don't  you come and try to get  as many people to come  as she could but better  better than that awkward  little laugh was the  actual face and then so  yeah but we and then  you guys Travis and  Danny wanted to come  along so we put you two  and Paul you you were  there I was there yeah  and so we put you three  with the Courtney the  other girl on a separate  table while Troy videoed 
[03:50:30]  and I'm audio recorded  well I called Courtney over  because I was tired of  listening to those two  I'll bet you called  Courtney over I saw you  leave with her too as a  matter of fact but that's  it that's it that's a  whole no I don't  believe it did you get  a number no I didn't  even ask we got it in  the back if you want it  bullshit I'm just calling  bullshit yeah me too  that's a whole nother  date to chronicle because  you were there Troy from  the very beginning when  we were walking with  them I don't even know  what this is let's let's  talk about let's go from  when they got to Dave and  Buster's we're walking 
[03:51:00]  there yeah do you she  recapped it what happened  she almost died yeah let's  let's listen to the clip  and then fill in what she  doesn't say this is Bobo's  date so we made it to  Dave and Buster's Jackie  how was the walk over  interesting I almost got  killed yeah we got lost a  few times and when you  say you almost died I  noticed at one point you  actually walked into  oncoming traffic he was  chatting me up and I was  walking to the street and  he didn't stop me from  walking directly into a  car and I almost got hit  and Troy was nice enough to 
[03:51:30]  grab me what a nice guy  what was nice was I  noticed Bobo actually  stopped walking because he  realized the car was going  to hit him and just kind  of realized once he was  safe that that was okay  it happened yeah we call  you know we call that a  we call that a maloonigism  maloonigism  maloonigism yeah he just  saw the car coming so he  stopped and I swear to  god Troy grabbed Jackie by  the arm because she was  texting she was gonna walk  right in front of that car  yeah she would have gotten  run the fuck over for sure 
[03:52:00]  for sure  sorry  while they were walking  though like they get to  this escalator going up  Dave and Buster's and  Bo it's a one person  escalator it's narrow and  Bobo pushes in front of  her to make sure that he's  the first guy on the  escalator then they're  going to the table and  Bobo sits down at the  table not before she gets  a chance to sit down  before she's even at the  table Bobo finds his chair  and sits down with his back  to all of us so we start  laughing Bobo realizes what 
[03:52:30]  we're laughing at and so he  gets up from the table and  jumps up pushes her out of  the way like physically she  was pushed so he could  pull her chair out for her  but he shoved her  I mean he's retarded  I mean what do you  she got launched halfway  across the room  it was just nice to see  like what Bobo what he  thinks happens at a date  like not even what he  thinks happens but like he  just thought that that was  a perfectly normal thing to  do was just to shove your 
[03:53:00]  date out of the way to try  to try to make up for  something that you forgot  yeah like he's so far gone  as far as like socially  interacting with the  opposite sex that it's  insane it's it's there's no  saving this um so she let  me tell you Jackie what  blew me away was that she  was an unbelievable  conversationalist because  somehow she was drawing  conversation out of Bobo  who was just giving her  absolutely zero to to to  pull from yeah like she  kept coming up with a  question based on the 
[03:53:30]  answers he was giving her  because it was like she  would ask a question and  then he would just give  her a one sentence answer  about himself and that  would be it no follow-ups  no nothing there was one  part where I guess Bobo  had been going off for a  little while yeah on the  same story and she kind of  was looking for an out and  she looked at me at one  point and I was just like  oh yeah this is really  interesting and so just to  fuck her immediately I was  like oh what are we  talking about Bobo can  we'll start from the  beginning because I  miss half of it at one  point she went to the  bathroom oh this is my  favorite part and she  came back and sat down 
[03:54:00]  at the table and I  literally waited 90  seconds before I turned  on the recorder and I  told Troy the same  because we were both at  the table Troy and I  just looked around the  room because she sat in  silence for a full 90  seconds on a first date  while Bobo was on his  phone um I turned on  you didn't even notice  that she came back no  she was just sitting  there for 90 seconds  until I turned on the  recorder and said I  think I whatever this is  what I said Jackie you've  been back from the 
[03:54:30]  bathroom for about 60  seconds uh look it was  90 okay actually just  sitting at the table in  silence uh you pulled  your own chair out uh and  came back from the  bathroom sitting in  silence as Bobo typed  on his cell phone how do  you how are you doing  never mind I was trying  to do so while I was  waiting  her first words back from  the bathroom were  interrupted by Bobo Bobo  the first time he talked  to her again after be  after just sitting in  silence was to interrupt 
[03:55:00]  her good I'm checking on  my Twitter while you were  waiting I was uh I was I  was just checking to see  Twitter comments because  people do make comments  about me oh yeah yeah kind  of a big deal you sure I  don't know you get you get  a mix you get sprinkled  it with fan with fans  people that are that are  fans that are supporters  of me and you get those  people that are haters  you see how interesting  you see how interested she 
[03:55:30]  is in this whole thing is  that Bobo like he's he has  the right concepts all in  place yeah it's just that  he has to boil every kind  of social situation down to  the lowest common  denominator so he wants to  try to impress the girl but  has no tact right about how  to actually do it and come  off like the cooler  people like me I'm very  famous that's just what it  don't mind if I take some  pictures for my for my  for my for my internet for  my for my Twitter for his  internet not for yours for  his but when he's get  grab some pictures of you  for his internet plus that's 
[03:56:00]  a great thing to uh to say  to a date hey do you mind  if I take a picture of you  for the internet pictures for  my for my for my for my  internet for my for my  Twitter um sure yeah they  do I do like to I do like  to show the fans what it's  like what it's like behind  this Bobo behind the scenes  I love when he refers to  himself in the third person  yeah because he's the biggest  celebrity ever Troy um he's  just trying to get laid  Paul really I mean you'd be 
[03:56:30]  doing the same thing you'd be  like yeah we're serious  behind the scenes yeah but  try on it on a date where  you're with a girl right  do you would you ever have  thought and maybe now you  will to say hey do you  mind if I take a picture I'd  like to give uh my fans a  taste of what it's like to  be Troy behind the scenes  like is that like a smooth  thing to think of it it may  actually work maybe I mean  they do I do like to I do  like to show the fans what  it's like what it's like  behind this Bobo behind the  scenes okay 
[03:57:00]  that was a sniffle I guess  Bobo's allergies were  acting up yeah this is a  stuffy day Bobo behind the  scenes is also afflating a  banana and and seducing a  that's true the last time  Bobo gave pictures behind  the scenes to his Twitter  followers it was of his  genitals so it was it was  done very artfully yeah  it really was I really like  the angle of attack that it  was on what from the top and  just stretching out your  pants well yeah to me it  looked like someone put a  breakfast sausage on a slice of 
[03:57:30]  pizza I really thought that's  all it was for a while but  it's like what it's like  behind this Bobo behind the  scenes  okay  that's all  what are followers you  have  no I got so many when you  appear on a show like Opie and  Anthony you get so many  followers  thousands  you gotta hear how quick he  answers that how she goes  how many do you have you  go thousands  thousands that should be in  our next uh Twitter  production yeah yeah yeah 
[03:58:00]  when you appear on Opie and  Anthony you get so many  followers  how many followers  thousands  thousands  I'm not on Twitter so  like I get thousands that's  the thing I get thousands  you wanted to just drive that  home  exactly he's like  Bobo okay wait wait wait  for a second just now you  were talking about you no no  no it's back to Bobo time  my thousands of fans need to  know what life is like behind  the scenes of Bobo um this was  I told Bobo while she was in 
[03:58:30]  the bathroom that what he's  missing is the charm aspect  like he's got out the fact  that he's world widely famous  I mean just huge thousands of  followers on Twitter he got that  out and he doesn't come on  Opie and Anthony okay he  appears right he appears but  now I'm thinking about he does  come on Opie and Anthony too  well no no he has he has he has  come on Opie and Anthony  Eric weren't you involved in  that he made him yeah you made  him right um so I I was like 
[03:59:00]  you got to turn on the charm  you got to Don Juan this thing  you got to tell her she's  beautiful you got to tell her  what a great time you're having  you got to tell her you know  what you whatever just  compliments girls love  compliments and and it's  getting swept off their feet  you got to win him some bling  like me I want all those  bling bling something Danny  even won me earrings yeah  I don't know what's going on  with that but um so Jackie set  him up for it too this is  Bobo's date that he won with  Jackie Jackie set him up by 
[03:59:30]  saying uh are you disappointed  that you're not on a date with  Courtney who was the runner-up  so I I mean I the recorder  wasn't on when they asked so I  had them and I had Bobo re-answer  the question Bobo uh we have our  food and Jackie just asked you are  you disappointed that it's not  Courtney you're on the date with  you guys are having a good time  I've been watching you and Jackie  are having great conversation  she's been I am disappointed  a little bit because she was kind  of the one that really seemed like 
[04:00:00]  the nice one that she really that  there was some interest there has  Jackie I mean on the date so far not  seemed interested it seems like that  I really can I'm really not sure what to  what vibe I'm getting  the vibe you were getting from Courtney  was desperation  it wasn't interest  Jackie did it uh I'll let you finish  chewing of course but did it hurt your  feelings when Bobo told you he was  disappointed that he wasn't sitting  next to Courtney  he's just um it's just idiot 
[04:00:30]  did it offend you a little bit  yeah Bobo is there something you can do  to kind of remedy the situation  I'm starting to like you  Jackie  I can tell  what  I can tell  I'm starting to like you  you're really good  I think that  I think the nice is starting to come out  they're out of you  oh it was for a second  I think the nice might come out of you  you're really good  you know my favorite thing about my 
[04:01:00]  girlfriend is  she's really good  she's really good  and that's it's like  Jackie's pissed  that he just said uh  he prefers Courtney to her  and then Bobo thinks to make up for it  the way to woo her  is to say  you know Jackie  I'm uh  I'm starting to like you  I think he's starting to think that his chances of getting laid  finally in his mind it's computing that  uh oh  this may not be happening  like I gotta  I gotta throw this in reverse  yeah I thought this was 
[04:01:30]  I'm starting to like you  I thought I was on the right path  all of a sudden things are blowing up  um  I think the pictures  can you repost the pictures on Facebook Eric  just so they're at the top again  yeah  uh Facebook slash Opie and Anthony  and that will have pictures  so you can see  Bobo  in comparison to Jackie  because that really does  maybe he was just playing hard to get  you think Bobo was  impossible  I mean look he's got thousands of fans  if he was a smarter guy  like he actually could have probably worked that all out for him  you know what I mean  he's not a smarter guy though 
[04:02:00]  that's the whole problem  that's what we're dealing with here  he's not  a smarter guy  Danny you see that guy walking up the hallway right there  you know what his name is  what  Dan Ross  I saw  oh is that him  yes that's him  tell that motherfucker I'm getting his emails  I'm sick of it already  that's him  he's much better looking than our Dan  I know he's the best looking Dan Ross  um  this is  when things got even worse  at that point  Jackie really turned on him  because she'd been nice to him throughout the day  and trying and everything  but she got  she started getting really frustrated with him 
[04:02:30]  as people tend to do with Bobo  um  this is when they started playing games together  and Bobo went straight to the  truck machine  whatever  some kind of truck machine  trying to win tickets  hey Jackie  while Bobo was playing  I mean you look bored  so I figured I'd just come over and talk  how's everything going  I mean  I have no words  I have no words  what's this machine you're standing next to  I don't know  it looks like you can win jewelry 
[04:03:00]  like for a female  and Bobo decided to walk past that one  and go to the car machine  how long do I have to babysit this kid  is that what you feel like you're doing  babysitting  yeah  well have fun  but is he like  I mean I understand  I'm like disappointing him  because I'm not Courtney  my rose is on the ground  I made him a rose  I'm a napkin  he's just stepping on it right now  he's just going through all the cards  that we bought at dinner  it's just in his hand  he's sucking it down 
[04:03:30]  at the first game that he's eating  you can have your cards  you can have your cards  alright  I didn't know you ordered one  with the gameplay card also  yeah  let's go with  okay  Bobo I'm going to go follow  Courtney playing some games  is that cool  alright  is that alright  yeah that's alright  alright thanks man  number one  he lets me walk off with his date  and number two  I called his date Courtney  the other girl's name  and he didn't even notice  but even before that  I mean look  if you're going to take a date 
[04:04:00]  to Dave and Buster's  the whole point is to  play games with your date  together  together right  that's the whole point of this  Bobo just immediately went off  on his own  to play video games  I like this game  to play the truck game  and his alternative  to the solution was  oh you have a card too  alright well you take your card  and I'll take mine  and we'll play separately then  like what kind of  Troy have you ever taken a date  to Dave and Buster's  I have not  would you  sure  would you do separate cards  like this  and kind of then  meet up at the end  to see who has more tickets  you know 
[04:04:30]  I mean  maybe like  maybe Bobo's plan was  to you split up  see who gets more tickets  and whoever has the most tickets  gets all the tickets combined  to buy something for themselves  I don't even think  he thought that far out  it was just like  oh trucks  oh games  need tickets  need tickets  go  I'll tell you  you know who the big winner  was that day  who?  me  why?  because I walked out of there  with two video games  and I got the big  what is it called  the big game  the big claw machine  like the super big one  the big choice  guess who won a fucking stuff  the big stuff bear  me  yeah you were cleaning up 
[04:05:00]  how the fuck  did you  how did that happen?  did you have go there  with tickets already  or did you  oh yeah dude  I already had like  10,000 points  on my fucking card  oh did you  yeah I've been carrying  my wallet for years  like it was about time  because all of a sudden  you had all this shit  I'm like what the fuck  is he doing?  yeah but dude  I fucking ruled the claw machine  if I'm at your Dave and Buster's  you better be prepared  to A  refill the tickets up  or B  restock the claw machine  and that's what happens  when Big D Ross  comes into your DMV  I guess so  Danny's telling you  that he's a Dave and Buster's  hustler  I will kick your ass  he's killing it man 
[04:05:30]  I can save money  buying video games  at Dave and Buster's  well listen we should  listen to Bobo  saying goodbye to Jackie  because Jackie was really  I mean she was buying games  for me  for Travis  for Troy  she was trying to get through  I realized what she was doing  very quickly  just trying to spend  all the money  on her Dave and Buster's card  so she could get the fuck  out of that place  and she did that  while Bobo of course  was still playing  as she was finishing her card  Bobo got the vibe  of the room just right  and went and took  $20 of his own money 
[04:06:00]  and put another $20  on his card  to play by himself  but this is Jackie  saying goodbye to Bobo  I've had five  just so you know  you kissed the back  of her ear  Bobo insisted on a hug  and he leaned in  to kiss her  at which point  Jackie pushed her head  as far forward  as she could possibly go  and he ended up  kissing the back  of her ear  through her hair  this is the least  romantic thing  I've ever seen  happen in my life  it was good to meet you 
[04:06:30]  alright I'm gonna  take off too  but I'll see you later  alright buddy  alright  alright bye Bobo  forget me  he asked you not to forget him  are you okay getting home  yeah  the date's over  did you have fun  yeah I had fun with you guys  not as much as Bobo  no I had to babysit him  the whole time  he literally talked about  Courtney the whole time  this is how the date went  I'm just gonna recap here  please do  we walked out of the studio  we got lost several times  in the  what was it 
[04:07:00]  like a quarter of a mile  there  even less  I almost got hit by a car  we get here  and order food  and he sat on his cell phone  the whole time on Twitter  then we went  talking about his fans  and got our game cards  which he just took off with  and played his own games  and that was basically  the last time I saw him  that was the date  well listen Jackie  it's been fun  I'm glad you had a good time  I'm glad you came to the studio  I'm glad you won the thousand dollars  I guess Bobo's still upstairs  he'll probably have some fun 
[04:07:30]  for a while  and hopefully he'll win himself  something nice  you actually left your tickets  with him  it's fine  he needs them more than I do  have a great day  and if anything in the future  happens between you and Bobo  I hope  you'll keep in contact  thank you so much  another  satisfied customer  from the Opie and Anthony show  Jackie  went home at that point  and obviously never  said a word to Bobo again  now we went back to the studio  yeah  to do our work  oh that's right  and Bobo came back 
[04:08:00]  and  well I called him  15 minutes later  and he informed us  that he was still at  Dave and Buster's  playing games  and  he eventually came back  looking for his jacket  and writing apology letters  to Opie  that Opie doesn't want to read  and I don't  look I'm glad you  bared with me through that  I thought that the bit  needed some completion  that's going to be the last  we hear from Bobo  in a very long time  very  is he banned from the show  yeah  okay good  yeah both shows  Ron and Fez  every show on the platform  really whatever
