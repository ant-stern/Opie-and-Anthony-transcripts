<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a listener-submitted "Worst Of" segment featuring extremely graphic 8-track audio pornography.  Opie, Anthony, and a studio guest, Jimmy, reacted to the poor acting and bizarre storylines with their own crude jokes and commentary.  The explicit audio detailed various sexual acts and body parts using highly offensive language.  Listener calls then shifted to humorous anecdotes about Anthony's high school experience, his failure to graduate, and comedic scenarios of him returning as an adult, again using vulgar language and sexual innuendo. A caller unexpectedly shared a story about their grandmother's involvement in 8-track pornography. The segment concluded with a call from a taxi driver with a speech impediment, "Big A," adding to the show's absurd tone.

Next, a rambling interview with "Big A" dominated the show.  He recounted his arranged marriage for money—receiving $3,000 to help his wife obtain a green card—with vague and contradictory details.  The hosts relentlessly teased his poor recall, focusing on his courtship, proposal, and wedding.  The conversation included graphic descriptions of his sex life and veered into vulgar jokes about body odor, sexual prowess, and bodily functions.  Speculation about his wife's potential involvement in illicit activities further fueled the comedic absurdity. The segment concluded with continued jokes and unanswered questions about his marriage and life.  A brief discussion followed on the Iraq War, US dependence on Middle Eastern oil, a hypothetical invasion of Venezuela for its oil, and a tangent about peanut butter-powered cars.

The show then segued into a series of tangents.  Discussions included the potential impact of a falling satellite, a Larry King medley request, and a caller's internet experiences including encounters with "Meatspin" and Paltalk.  A humorous bit mocked Larry King's confusion during an autism segment, followed by discussions of internet videos like "Two Girls One Cup."  Significant time was devoted to analyzing audio clips of China Doll, focusing on her incoherent speech, suspected drug use, and connection to Anna Nicole Smith.  The show then critiqued Tara Reid's reality show, "Taradise," highlighting her incoherent speech, apparent substance abuse, and lack of participation, playing and analyzing several clips.  A phone call with Tara Reid herself concluded this section with more rambling, incoherent conversation, and discussion of her eating habits. Jim Norton was present in studio during this portion.

A segment played audio recordings of Tara Reid's rambling and nonsensical travel anecdotes, which were punctuated by sarcastic comments from the hosts and callers. This section also included highly offensive, racist and violent jokes. The show then interviewed voice actor Billy West.  The conversation covered his career (including *Ren & Stimpy*, *Doug*, and Bugs Bunny), his time on and departure from the Howard Stern Show, and controversies surrounding it.  West shared anecdotes about the animation industry and voice acting, including various impressions.

The show continued with Billy West discussing his experiences in Hollywood and the Hamptons.  An anecdote involved him paying for a Red Bull with a $100 bill.  The hosts then discussed listener-submitted family trees, specifically Sam the intern's claim of being related to Thomas Jefferson and William the Conqueror.  Extensive speculation and jokes followed regarding the validity of his claims and his alleged ancestors. The show concluded with a discussion of an American Idol contestant with ambiguous gender presentation, including the contestant's audition footage, the judges' comments, and humorous, altered lyrics to the contestant's song. Patrice O'Neill joined the hosts in studio for this segment, and the discussion included homophobic and transphobic slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Um, normally, these two tools decide what you'll be hearing on the worst of opiate anything.  Hey, this is Sam. And this is E-Rod.  Yeah.  They're kids.  However, you've called, emailed, tweeted, fed back, and screamed that you could do a much better job of selecting bits than they can.  So now, not so much as a thank you for years of faithful support, but more to stop for your bitching and complaining. 
[00:00:30]  We're giving you the opportunity to pick your favorite moments from the show.  Uh, I need to hear. I gotta hear. So if you guys can play that again, that would be great.  I love that damn thing. That's what got me hooked on you guys.  Opie and Anthony present the All Request Worst Of Show.  Call 877-4-Worst Of and tell us what you want to hear.  And remember, if it sucks, it's your own damn fault.  Today's listener request voicemail has 10 new messages. 
[00:01:00]  First message.  Hi, this is Dan from Ohio.  Uh, the bit I would like to hear, the 8-track porno again, that was classic.  It was frickin' hilarious, and I'd love to hear it again.  Uh, thanks.  Over.  Message deleted.  Request Worst Of Show.  Huh?  Oh, is that Danny?  Yeah.  What happened?  I was making fun of Pat Duffy in the office. 
[00:01:30]  All right, that's work.  That's okay.  Hey, while we have you in here, the lustful sex life of a perverted nympho housewife part one.  Oh yeah, this is fantastic.  What is this?  Well, I think it was a listener sent a link to all these old 8-track porno tapes.  And when I say 8-track porno tapes, it's exactly what it sounds like.  It's old audio tapes.  And there's no video involved with this whatsoever, so I'm assuming that you just listen to this  in your car, in your home stereo.  And I guess you're supposed to beat off to it, but it's ridiculous.  To sound.  So it's audio porno. 
[00:02:00]  It's audio porn.  All right.  Weird.  And this particular episode just had so much goodness, I figured I would just leave it  in parts.  So this is the first part.  If it goes over, there could be a part two.  Oh, I like that.  Carol's friend calls to tell her she fucked Joe the bartender.  Oh, good.  And the dialogue is just terrible.  Carol's saucy.  Obviously new.  Carol, you fucking whore.  Honey, that's... 
[00:02:30]  Oh my God.  Save that for any time a girl named Carol calls the show.  There's a whore in your building.  Carol is a whore.  Wait, you're going to claim that?  Fuck.  I got to claim that one.  Every time Carol...  It doesn't matter.  Any Carol on the phone is going to get that sound clip.  I don't care if she's a nun.  Don't worry.  There's plenty more where that came from.  All right.  There we go.  I want some from my machine.  Let's go.  Yes.  No machine.  Jimmy's machine. 
[00:03:00]  Hello?  Carol, you fucking whore.  Honey, that's a hell of a way to talk to your best girl buddy.  What the fuck are you bitching about?  You know damn good and well what I'm talking about, you bitch.  You fucked Joe the bartender last night and he wasn't...  The bartender.  The bartender.  Who is this, fucking Hepburn?  You put Norman's cock in your mouth, you dirty bitch.  He told you to check the phone, he was going to look at loons, and you licked his ball bag  and fingered his asshole and his prostate fell out. 
[00:03:30]  The acting's horrendous.  Sounds like one of mine and Opie's live reads when we have a script.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm proud of my live reads.  Opie, you fucking whore.  Ha!  You fucked Joe the bartender last night.  He wasn't worth shit.  I sucked his joint for 30 minutes and his prick was like a piece of spaghetti.  To crown it off, the bastard had the nerve to laugh when it wouldn't come up. 
[00:04:00]  But he finally admitted that you had fucked and sucked him earlier during his lunch break.  Now I'm sitting here with a banana up my hungry cunt.  All right, that's good stuff.  We gotta play this little free FM.  Up my hungry cunt.  Hungry cunt.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Are you fucking...  And his prick was like a piece of spaghetti. 
[00:04:30]  Spaghetti.  Spaghetti.  It's like 1940s.  She got fucked on the African queen.  How old is this fucking thing?  Fucking bogey stuck in her shitter.  Bogey.  Put leeches on her ass and fucked her.  This is fucking terrible.  What accent is that?  It's just...  Does anybody know?  It's an accent of the 60s.  Affectation.  It's just how they were talking in this...  I would guess 60s, early 70s on this one.  My. 
[00:05:00]  Well, I mean, judging from the box art on the 8-track, I mean, it was definitely early 70s.  Early 70s.  Big hairy muff.  Fucking Danny finds the shit.  I know.  She was off to it.  She couldn't help it.  He grabbed her ass and she creamed.  Here we go.  Oh, honey, baby, you know he never even looked my way.  That dirty liar.  Don't give me that shit, you bitch.  He shoved that pencil prick of his up your cunt.  Up your asshole and down your throat so often he could find that cave of a cunt of yours in the dark. 
[00:05:30]  All right, little pussy buddy.  But when he grabbed me by the ass at the club last night, I creamed in my pants.  Wait a minute, you cock-greedy bitch.  After all, I'm the one who's a divorcee and he's all alone.  At least, Grace, you're still married and have some steady cock around.  You're alone like the top girl in a whorehouse, you bitch.  You could have at least warned me.  What am I supposed to do with their burnt-out fucks after you've sucked their nuts dry?  Plus, that old pencil-prick husband of mine doesn't thrill me anymore. 
[00:06:00]  All right, little buddy, I'm sorry.  Next time I'll tell you.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  Awful, unbelievable, unsexy guy.  That was written by a guy, obviously.  See, you know what's disturbing to me when you hear this older audio?  You know, I, in my naiveness, always, I thought, like, ass-fucking was, like, a new invention.  Oh, really?  And you're just, like, you don't want to think that, like, your grandma or anyone that's old in your life 
[00:06:30]  was, like, doing the same shit you were doing, you know what I mean?  Getting it up the ass!  Like, feeding bananas to your hungry cunt.  I thought that was more of an invention of the 90s, you know?  Yo, cock-reedy, huh?  Right.  Huh?  Huh?  They romanticize this shit when you watch old movies and stuff.  Yeah.  That's, uh, wow.  I didn't even know that was available.  Some kind of...  Apparently.  Some...  And how many volumes we got so far?  Well, this was, like, the first few minutes of just one. 
[00:07:00]  This whole episode was, like, 35, 40 minutes long.  What are you supposed to do with this, though?  You could not possibly jerk off to that.  Jimmy, stop it.  I got, like, I'll be honest, I got, like, four.  No, you didn't.  I do.  I had four go.  I'm not hard, but it's snaking, like, a little bit.  You cock-greedy cunt.  You did not!  Well, she tried to tug on it for an hour.  It was like a piece of spaghetti.  I laughed at her.  By the way...  I grabbed her ass, and she creamed her in a pass.  Literally, it was creamed corn.  Jay from Florida, from Wagbag. 
[00:07:30]  Did Jimmy Schubert get a writing credit for this?  It's got a patty full of green corn, and then you've got some potato flakes on your shoes.  Linger longer.  Potato flakes.  Yeah, I'm going to give you a double knuckle in your piss pump, and then you're going to be...  You're going to be cramming in your jeans!  You piss pump.  I don't even know what that means.  Fucking Schubertism.  Where is Schubert?  We need Schubertism.  Yeah, we're not making fun of him.  We want him...  I love Schubert.  You've got to call the show.  You need the Schubertisms.  FYI, you guys mentioned the Phantom Vibrate cell phone.  Opie said it was dead people trying to contact us. 
[00:08:00]  He said they just don't know how to speak to us.  Oh, okay.  Right, right.  And this guy, of course, writing, linger longer, which has taken off.  Mm-hmm.  All the way, May, took it up the ass after every win.  A lot of people lingering longer with...  All right, all the way, May.  All the way, May.  As she slid into home plate, some Negro was holding a baseball bat.  She took it all in her hungry cunt.  And a young Bill O'Reilly walked in while Grandmama was being shish kebabed 
[00:08:30]  by two black cops the size of the Chrysler building.  Grandmama, what are you doing?  Get out of here, you little meddler.  I've got two dark seed pumpers in my mouth and asshole.  You'll learn about this someday when you dine in Harlem.  They can't vote, but boy, can they fuck.  Jimmy with the characters lately, man.  I'm fucking...  I'm the character kid.  That was my nickname in high school.  What was the character yesterday?  The con.  Coach, whoever comes, I get. 
[00:09:00]  Coach Jimmy, they called it.  Coach Jimmy.  Hey, Steve in Albany, when is this going to air on Sonic Theater, XM 163?  Yes.  Put that on.  The old-time radio.  I fed a banana to my hungry cunt.  This will be on Audible later.  Yes.  Say goodnight, Gracie.  And then he shit in my mouth, you silly goose.  Hey, the young O'Reilly sitting there watching his granny.  I take the cock all the way down to those plum-like balls.  That's right, Bill. 
[00:09:30]  It's called melanin, and you don't have it, which would explain you a little dingle.  But boy, can they give a gal a deep dicking?  Here's an apple.  Don't tell your grandfather.  He's so surprised the cum is white.  That's right.  It's the seed of the devil.  He's pumping it into me.  But I only take it in the shitter because we don't have abortions.  He's got the black power fist in my hungry cunt. 
[00:10:00]  You six-foot-eight loofus sponge using fraud, cocksucker.  Hypocrite jizz bucket.  You're three years old and you're six-foot-eight, and grandmama has got a black cock on her cheek,  and one in her asshole, and one in each hand.  That's right.  I have the Harlem Globetrotters.  Curly Neal just shit my pussy. 
[00:10:30]  And we're off.  Metal-lock lemon ripped my cunt.  That's right.  At first, they send in the white incompetent team, and they all try to fuck me, but their  dicks are like spaghetti.  Then the Globetrotters come in, and he threw his cock at me, and it snapped right back into  his hand.  It was a trick cock.  I remember sitting in the audience when the negro came toward me with a big bucket and 
[00:11:00]  threw it at me.  I thought it was confetti, but it was cum.  And I caught it all in my mouth, young Bill, you six-foot-eight conservative loofus sponge  big cocked little fella.  That's right.  Grandma's got a pussy full of sickle cell.  What do you think of them apples?  You'll be talking about this someday on Fox News, won't you?  You're surprised they eat like us.  You ought to see how they fuck, young Bill. 
[00:11:30]  They're making a nana hammock.  One in the mouth, one in the shitter, and nana swings when they meet in the middle somewhere  near the liver.  They fill up nana like a cannoli.  Your grandfather dresses like Oscar did all the fire, and hasn't fucked nana in quite a  long time, Bill.  That's cuckold. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, Florida Steve, I gotta read this.  Metal Ark Lemon just gave me a shit hat.  What's that?  Metal Ark Lemon just gave me a shit hat.  A shit hat, darling.  It looks like the one nana wears on Sunday, but there's no flour in it.  A shit hat covering my eye socket.  I'll tell you that I'm afraid of blacks, but I'm only afraid that when they walk in, I'm 
[00:12:30]  going to kneel and suck their cock so hard that their ears cave in.  That's right, young Bill.  Nana likes her black cock in her mouth.  What do you think of them apples, you Republican?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why don't you...  Good point, Scott, from Chicago.  What about a little sweet Georgia Brown if we're going to do the Glover?  Oh, yeah.  That'll bring the whole bit home, you know what I'm saying?  Poor nana.  She loved it. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, boy, she couldn't get enough.  Couldn't get enough.  Coming to town.  We got two more clips to play.  God, there's three more parts.  At least.  Well, just keep them coming.  My dear.  This is radio gold, my friend.  You want to hear the next clip?  Sure.  All right.  Well, self-explanatory.  You little whore.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, my God, is that wonderful?  Oh, wow, there are so many good sound clips in this.  Who the fuck would say this?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  This needs a whole bank.  Oh.  One bank dedicated to this audio.  Thank you for that one again.  Oh, my God.  I've got to hear her say that again.  You little whore.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Who the hell is there? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, nobody, you dumb bitch.  I couldn't wait anymore on climbing the damn walls.  Oh, I told you I had a banana up my cunt.  Oh, God, it's good.  Jesus, it's just right.  I've got it all the way in.  And I just wish I had another one up my ass.  Oh, you dirty bitch.  With you, anything goes.  I have to admit, when it comes to fucking, you're a genius. 
[00:14:30]  I've always used carrots.  Oh, but this is smoother and thick all the way.  Jesus.  But it's going to mash up in your pussy.  A carol won't stay hard.  A carol's got the right idea with the carrot.  Of course she does.  You don't have to dig out carrot after you're done.  That's right.  When you're finished, your pussy smells like bunny breath.  It does.  It sounds like Samantha from Sex and the City. 
[00:15:00]  Speaking of bananas.  Right, right.  I'm coming, you cunt.  You dumb horse-faced cunt.  Hudson from Montana.  Curly dribbled all over her labia.  That's right.  Oh, I just wish I had one for my ass.  You horse-faced beard for a homosexual cunt. 
[00:15:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Cha, cha, cha.  Stupid fucking show.  Are they making a movie out of it now?  Great.  Hold on.  We got Gene from Waterford.  Gene, what's up?  No, it's actually Jim.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Jim.  Not much.  I was calling.  I got kind of a...  I heard you guys, you know, stuff's going pretty good right now.  I didn't really want to call in, but I had to.  I found out not too long ago that my grandmother actually did this stuff. 
[00:16:00]  She did audio porn back in the day?  She did.  She did.  And it was very...  I found out from some papers and stuff I came upon and asked my mom about it, and she wasn't  too happy that I found out.  But supposedly, you know, it's just the same way kind of...  My grandmother was on Broadway a lot.  And the same kind of way actors and actresses today, they go down on their luck out in California,  they go to porn, you know, visually.  She kind of did the same thing through audio.  Your grandma? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, she, you know, wouldn't be doing so well on Broadway, and just drop into the studio,  make a couple of quick extra bucks, and just sit there and smoke cigarettes all day  and pretend that she's having orgasms and shit, so...  Jesus Christ, that's great.  Not too funny to find out about, you know, when you pitch your grandmother baking cookies  and muffins for you, and then you think of her sitting around with a couple other  old slutty bitches and talking about how she's having bananas.  Bananas.  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Not too fun.  I'm glad it's giving you guys...  I mean, I don't know, you guys might come across one of her tapes, so...  That'd be good for you to listen to.  Yeah, you came across the paper, and we might come across the tapes, and your banana was  better than you were given her credit for.  Yeah, you guys find a...  She's having a bad old crow at that.  Nancy the Nibbler.  That was her name?  I think that's her stage name.  Nancy the what?  Nibbler.  Nibbler.  Nibbler.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, you don't want to get cocky.  Nibble that.  Nibbled.  She used to team up with Gail Guppy.  All right, Gene, thanks for your story.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, this is coming in like crazy.  Let me just do this real fast.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana, cunt.  Banana, cunt.  They talk about fucking the delivery boy from the grocery store.  Danny, why are you...  Why is Danny sitting here?  What?  We need part two.  We can't wait. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, this is great.  You think I'm going to waste part two on today?  Yeah.  You said how many parts do you got, really?  From this alone, there could probably be another...  I mean, the dialogue's so awful.  I mean, seven parts at least.  Wow.  This is like having coke, and you're like, well, yeah, we could use a little more.  Can we get a little more?  I know it's for the whole weekend, but, yeah, we'll do another part today.  Yeah?  We'll still have five parts left.  Well, I mean, this is only one of the H-Racks.  I probably found there's like ten of them.  Oh, yeah, we could easily do another part then.  All right.  Let's hear a little more. 
[00:18:30]  All right, here we go.  It was good, but, damn it, I'm still hot for a stiff prick.  I know what you mean, pussy buddy.  Nothing beats hot for a stiff prick.  We should get one of the CBS lawyers.  It was good, but, damn it, I'm still hot for a stiff prick.  Damn it. 
[00:19:00]  I know what you mean, pussy buddy.  Nothing beats it.  While we're on the subject, why don't you try the delivery boy at the grocery store?  Is he any good?  Is he any good shit?  He's got a cock on him like a horse.  He's circumcised, and when his head swells, it turns rose red.  Just thinking about it, makes me put my finger up my cunt.  You mean your fucking hand, you bitch.  That cave you have could take an elephant.  Come on, get off your phone. 
[00:19:30]  That's right.  How about some more animals?  The horse and the elephant.  What the?  She's saying she has a large vagina.  I think that's what she's getting at.  My goodness.  Pussy buddies.  If your cunt was any bigger, there'd be stalactites hanging in it.  Jesus, these are awful.  Being your fucking hand, you bitch.  Yes, shave that platypus.  Fucking animals.  It's all animal stuff.  Yes.  You hippo.  Hold on one second.  Bitch, that cave you have could take an elephant. 
[00:20:00]  Now come on, get off the phone.  I'm going to order some more bananas from the grocery store.  Bill, did you bring home those bananas for Nana?  You know what a three-pointer is?  Nana's a three-pointer.  I've got one in the mouth, pussy, and ass.  That's a three-pointer.  I'm a five-pointer if there's one for each hand, young Bill.  Be careful.  I'll get black cum all over my charm bracelet.  Don't tell your grandfather. 
[00:20:30]  I've got more black semen in my mouth than the African Navy.  Keep it down, Bill.  You'll talk about this on Fox someday.  That's right.  I'm doing a female rip-off voice of Anthony's 1940s guy.  Whatever works.  I changed gender and I added cunt.  It's a different person.  Matt from St. Louis, I like to make werewolf cunt movies.  I don't like the A train. 
[00:21:00]  I like the N train.  Now you go play, Bill.  Nana's taping it.  Oh, I don't know.  Nana got nervous.  Nana got nervous.  They wait outside my door like it's the unemployment line.  I tell them there's a little government cheese in my womb.  And they dive in headfirst.  Oh, don't bother, Nana, when she's getting a deep dicking, Bill.  Your grandfather, since the war, hasn't been able to get it up. 
[00:21:30]  You six-foot-nine, four-year-old with a big cock, apparently, according to the transcripts.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hey, this is Wolf from Texas, and I'd like to request a bit about how Ant never graduated high school.  They talk about why he failed and what it'd be like if he went back. 
[00:22:00]  Some good shit, man.  Listen to it.  Don't listen to it.  I don't give a shit.  Message deleted.  So we're talking about college graduates.  And we say this every time this comes out.  You get one of these a year, maybe two.  This is your feel-good story, I guess.  A 90-year-old Illinois woman gets high school diploma.  Oh, fuck, she didn't even do the college thing?  That's only high school? 
[00:22:30]  You suck.  I mean, you know what?  This news shouldn't have came out the same day an 11-year-old genius is graduating college.  Yeah.  90-year-old suburban Chicago woman who dropped out of school to help her family during the Great Depression  now has her high school diploma.  Don't use the fucking Depression as an excuse.  It ended at some point.  You could have gone back to school.  When did the Depression end, the Great Depression? 
[00:23:00]  You know, after the shenanigans started with World War II.  I'm trying to think if I know my history.  Shenanigans.  In the 30s.  I was going to go 30s.  Yeah.  Okay.  30s.  Eleanor Benz left Chicago Public Schools Lakeview High in 1936.  1936.  So it was kind of at the end of the Depression, right?  Yeah.  Her senior year to take a job.  Over the following decade, she moved to the suburb of, ready for this? 
[00:23:30]  Gurney.  No way!  Another story.  That's where the president allegedly had oral sex with a gentleman that accused him of having oral sex with him.  Right here in Gurney.  Crack cocaine for Obama, right?  Powder cocaine for him.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Yeah.  Gurney, and had 15 children, 54 grandchildren, and 37 great-grandchildren.  Oh, Christ.  Well, back then, I guess you had to populate the fucking planet. 
[00:24:00]  She was a baby machine.  No shit, huh?  She attended night school for typing and bookkeeping.  Good womanly jobs.  Wait.  Could she take a punch back then?  They all could.  Yeah, sure could.  Go to their place.  My roast, it's burned.  Bam.  Why would you take typing?  We're all great at typing now, just because of the computer age.  Well, yeah.  Right?  Was she on the ENIAC?  And bookkeeping?  Bookkeeping, very important. 
[00:24:30]  But she recently told one of her daughters that never completing high school was one of the  greatest disappointments.  Her children contacted the school, and they just gave her a diploma, it looks like.  Oh, she didn't even have to work for it.  It says the school approved of her diploma, so it looks like she didn't even have to go  back to school for it.  Why don't they do that for me?  I got to be 90?  And you swear-  You don't have one, dude.  Well, you swear all you have to do is complete gym, too, right?  All I fucked up at was-  Is that real?  Some gym credits.  Yeah.  What a fucking asshole. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I know.  He's an asshole.  I thought you were me.  So go back.  That's a funny sitcom.  The older gentleman goes back and takes gym class.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Here comes Anthony.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, yeah, I'm just fucking diddling the girls.  Yes.  Oh, he's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their heinies.  He's Anthony.  He's older than the teachers, and he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic. 
[00:25:30]  He's Anthony.  He needs two credits to graduate.  He makes $8 million a year, but he wants the credits anyway.  Why?  I don't know.  He's Anthony.  I think how cool I could be pulling up in a high school in the Shelby.  See?  I'd have a nice car.  I could invite the girls over to the hot tub to drink.  You'd have an excuse to have the high school girls at your house.  Oh, they would fucking clamor.  We're studying.  He tries to be everyone's friend, but he gives all the girls the creeps. 
[00:26:00]  He's Anthony.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He drives a Shelby.  All the kids key it because they hate his guts.  He's Anthony.  High school girls in the backyard.  They say, we don't care if you have a jacuzzi.  You're a creep.  We all have them, too.  We're rich kids.  You're Anthony.  Stop acting like it's a spaceship, asshole. 
[00:26:30]  It's only a jacuzzi.  It has bubbles.  It gets hot.  We get it.  We get it.  That's right.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  That's right.  Oh, he tries to brag about things that all the kids already have.  What a dope.  He's Anthony.  He tells them he has baseball cards and bubblegum.  Anthony brags about things that would have been cool in 1975, but now everyone has them, 
[00:27:00]  so they don't care.  He's Anthony.  But he doesn't care as long as just one girl out of the hundred come over.  The one girl who shows up has a Pete Rose haircut.  He fucks her anyway because he's Anthony.  And daddy issues.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, he carries a Trapper Keeper.  Full of Hitler photographs.  He's Anthony.  He tries to quote downfall to all the teenage girls. 
[00:27:30]  He gives them the willies.  He's Anthony.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  He's the only high school student that has hair plugs.  I do not have hair plugs.  They say, hey, there's a toilet seat cover on that guy's head.  He's Anthony.  Oh, I don't have plugs.  Just accept it.  You do.  No. 
[00:28:00]  They just changed the name.  That's all.  No.  They're individual follicles placed independently.  Look, you don't even have it in you anymore to try to explain.  Plugs are those eraser-sized things that they put in your head that made you look like you had Barbie doll hair.  These are very individual.  Every hair is individually placed.  It takes forever.  Not forever, but, you know, good fucking ten hours.  While all the kids are having a catch, Anthony's passed out with guns in his hand.  He's Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  The show should be 25 minutes of the opening song, and then maybe five minutes of actual.  Five minutes of me trying to do pull-ups or something.  Oh, yeah, running through the gym.  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, I've got to run through gym class.  Christian, it looks like.  Miller plays.  Christian.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi, sir.  A couple years ago, I've been a fan since day one, and a couple years ago, sitting in a college class for coaching at Stony Brook,  and the professor's in front of me talking.  He goes, yeah, there's some guy, Anthony, on the radio who's blaming me for failing high school. 
[00:29:00]  And, of course, that catches my attention.  And he knows, the professor knows that Anthony talks about him on the radio.  He's like, yeah, if he had just finished his phys-ed classes, maybe I would have passed him.  He was a derelict when I knew him.  He had some nice things to say in English.  Was he Cirillo?  That's him.  Yeah.  You know what?  It was Cirillo.  You know what, though?  You shouldn't fail.  I was a degenerate back then.  I was.  If you passed everything but Jim, you've got to give the kid the diploma.  Yeah, hand me the diploma. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, we all know Anthony better than that.  That's right.  You know why?  Because when he was in high school, he had hair like Lawrence Hilton Jacobs.  He's Anthony.  All right, have a great day, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Wow, he's a professor at Stony Brook now?  What is he professing?  Toes on the line?  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  Bring your shorts home and wash them every so often?  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Why don't you have your uniform?  Uniform. 
[00:30:00]  Toes on the line.  Toes on the line.  Come here.  Why don't you have your uniform?  It's not a uniform.  They're called fucking shorts.  And no, I don't have them.  I've got my sneakers on with my jeans.  What are we going to be doing that?  I really need fucking workout attire.  Stupid.  Are we going to fucking play goddamn volleyball?  They should have worked something out with you.  That's dumb.  Let's go to Eric and me.  Toes on the line.  That's what I remember from him.  Why toes on the line?  Because we all have a standard attention because we're in the fucking military for some reason 
[00:30:30]  with gym teachers.  Before you do a little kickball.  They think they're drill instructors.  You're not.  You're failed fucking athletes.  Oh, that's true.  No way.  No how.  Failed athletes.  His anger at the teachers comes out when he's in class.  He gets thrown out again because he's 53.  He's Anthony.  53.  Come on.  I don't know his real age.  I'm Jim. 
[00:31:00]  Let's go to Eric and me.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Maybe Jimmy can make a song about this.  The girls are going to think he's creepy, but just imagine how the boys are going to feel  when they have to shower with them after gym class and they see that massive hog.  Oh, jeez.  That could be a problem.  That's right.  Don't shower with the other boys.  I'll take cold showers.  Speaking of that, his hog hangs out, his gym shorts.  He's Anthony.  His big delicious cock.  Shouldn't be black.  It's not.  He's Anthony. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, we got something.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Call me up.  Call me up.  Call me up.  I'm sitting back down at the 7-11, but someone said he made it okay.  I'm in.  First, Bueller.  Very nice.  Where's Mr. Kumia?  Is he still on campus?  I think I saw him by the food machine.  Maybe you get a little, like, Rudy moment.  You go back to high school and you get on the football team or something. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I would do.  They carry him off the field going, Kumia?  Yeah, that's exactly what I would do.  They carry him off the field because he's been tackled by a 6'5 guard and is paralyzed  below the neck.  Yeah, they have to carry him off and get a fucking tube so he can breathe.  But then they go.  That's funny, man.  Then they go, you know, he's suffered enough, so they give you the diploma.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they put it in his teeth and he's sitting in that chair with his fucking staring  straight ahead with his stupid little fucking cardboard hat on.  Oh, he shits into a bag. 
[00:32:30]  He breathes into a tube.  He's Anthony.  Oh, holy shit.  They put the gown and cap on.  I'm just destroyed.  They put the gown and cap on your lifeless body.  Oh, he used to drive a Shelby.  Now he wears adult diapers.  He's Anthony.  Wow, this has taken a turn, Jim.  I don't think I like going back to school now.  That's what happens.  I know.  Jared in Utah has one.  Jared?  While the kids are all having a smoke, he's old enough for a stroke. 
[00:33:00]  He's Anthony.  Hey!  No!  How dare you?  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris?  Yo.  Hey.  I had a teacher flunk me for my gym class so that I had to go back for the 13th grade.  And for half a year, I just took nothing but gym.  That's what I was supposed to do.  What do you mean nothing but gym?  You had to do a whole other year?  I had to take two periods of gym a day.  Until noon, taking gym classes, me and my stoner buddy, who also had to take the 13th grade, 
[00:33:30]  kept skipping out on gym.  You know what a bunch of bullshit that is, though, man?  I mean, come on.  You're going to school.  Don't give me shit about fucking gym class.  What is that going to do?  Jim should be like, oh, go ahead.  The worst part is the guy decided to open a driving range when he retired.  So every day, he's fucking just hitting golf balls after flunking a bunch of kids in gym.  What an idiot.  Go for him. 
[00:34:00]  It should be a leisure activity.  You're doing your school thing, and now it's like, you know, if you want to run around the  gymnasium for a while, go ahead.  If you don't, that's fine, too.  Your whole fucking future shouldn't depend on whether you did enough pull-ups during the  presidential physical fitness test.  I love gym, but what is it?  I hated it.  Oh, who doesn't love gym?  But what does it matter in the end?  You got enough exercise when you weren't in school.  I know.  It didn't matter.  When did you stop getting a lot of exercise?  Running around like a nut. 
[00:34:30]  17, 18, maybe?  The second I started smoking pot.  Yeah, see?  17, 18.  Let me go to John in New York.  John.  Hello, John.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Why do I picture Anthony pulling up in front of the school in a black Trans Am jamming  an REO Speedwagon?  Oh, man, that would goopy.  That would look.  Oh, that would be the ultimate creep.  Sitting in the car with the windows open until that one part with the lyrics you wanted  everybody to hear was over? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You would time that shit, Jimmy?  No, I didn't drive in high school, but I know I'm a fucking total douche.  I know I would have.  I drove my Dodge Aspen wagon.  I had a Baja bug.  That's right.  A Baja bug?  No, that's a cool fucking high school vehicle.  It was like a dune buggy thingy.  That's very cool.  Yeah, that's why I was degenerate.  He's a degenerate.  Did I say that?  Raging Bull?  Yeah, did I say that?  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  Less in Alabama.  Alabama, move! 
[00:35:30]  Less.  If Anthony went back to school and he had sex with one of the teachers, would the teacher  get charged with having sex with an underage student or what?  Oh, he got it all backwards.  Yeah, well.  See, I would be in trouble for having sex with somebody who is underage, even if I had  sex with the teacher.  Now he laughs at his own joke.  He cleaned it up for you there, Les.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island. 
[00:36:00]  Matt.  He took you to the prom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  That's funny.  That fucking guy nailed it.  Fucking nailed it.  Chris in Houston.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Go back to 1959.  Hop in the DeLorean, Anthony.  Get your diploma there.  Then I'll fit in.  Yeah.  That's bullshit.  I'll go to Hill Valley High School.  You don't care, right? 
[00:36:30]  About a diploma?  Yeah.  I don't even think about it.  Yeah.  I could give a flying fuck-a-roonie, as they say.  Doesn't matter to me.  School's a waste of time.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  School?  Forget about it.  A few classes were worth it.  Not me.  And the socializing was very worth it.  Got to prepare for the real world.  Yeah.  The rest of it was bullshit.  I did a lot of socializing.  Bullshit.  That's all they did.  Books.  No way, no how.  Books.  Just the book hands.  Reading books. 
[00:37:00]  Fuck you.  No way.  No how.  Never.  Oh.  He quotes a lot from The Shining, and none of the kids have seen it.  So they think he's retarded.  He's Anthony.  Oh, I hated kids like this guy, Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on?  I went to school in New York City, and my last, my senior year of high school, I had  my gym classes, my last class of the day.  I had a one-to-five schedule.  I only had five classes.  I was on the baseball team.  The baseball coach was a gym teacher. 
[00:37:30]  He tells me, hey, Joe, this is your last class?  I'm like, yeah.  He goes, see you in June.  I said, I'll see you in June.  Never went to class all year long.  Passed with an A, whatever.  My two buds tried to do the same thing.  They had to go to summer school to graduate.  Oh.  What were you doing to the coach that he gave you a little favor there?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yeah, they were the coach's pets, you know, because they were on the football teams.  I was one of the better players.  You know what?  I kind of hated guys like you, but it makes sense if you're, you know, I practice after 
[00:38:00]  school every day, playing for the high school team, whether it's baseball, whatever.  Yeah, why would you have to take gym, too?  It's a waste of time.  Coach Cirillo.  It's not working out as it is.  My senior year classes were even worse.  I mean, this was New York City schools in the 1980s.  Like, yeah, I'm around the same age as Opie.  My first class of the day was ceramics.  My second class of the day was English.  All right, I had to go there.  Then I had homeroom, independent study photography, and sports history.  That was it.  Then I went to McDonald's, and I was up that day. 
[00:38:30]  Sports history?  What did you fucking go to school?  It was that trivial pursuit.  Come on.  Sports history?  That's not a class.  Mm-mm.  But that's what it was.  Oh, what a fucking clusterfuck.  I got so screwed.  Stupid Coach Cirillo.  See?  See what he said?  That I was a degenerate.  He did catch me smoking pot, though, outside.  But I was smoking a big...  I took such a huge hit off of this doobie outside, and I probably hold it in, and it 
[00:39:00]  was by the back gym doors, and they fling open, and there's Cirillo, like right in front  of me.  And he just...  He took his pointer finger and jabbed it into my stomach immediately, and I just went...  And just blew pot smoke out.  And he's like, get to the office.  That sounds like a John Hughes film.  Dude, it absolutely happened.  He poked me...  Because he knew, like, kids smoke pot back there.  So he was listening.  Why are you smoking pot right at the door?  Because you were the cool guy that smoked pot by the door, even though the gym teacher 
[00:39:30]  came out every so often.  Oh.  Yeah, high school fucking thought pattern.  So he would listen, and if you're out there, and he smelt it and stuff, he would fling  that door open and just poke you in the gut.  And you'd go...  And I just blew a big fucking thing of smoke out in his face.  What an asshole.  And he goes, go to the office.  Go to the office.  Now.  Yeah.  What is this about?  This is just me, man.  Dave in Tennessee.  Hey, Anthony, you're that guy that shows up at the party, 50 years old, with a letterman 
[00:40:00]  jacket and a male pattern baldness.  Well, you got the male pattern baldness taken care of.  A letterman jacket.  And I'm not 50.  Shut up.  Jesus.  And I don't have a letterman jacket.  Hey, girls.  I lettered in track.  That was an accomplishment.  Fuck that.  I lettered in track.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right.  Do you still have your jacket?  No, you're making fun of me. 
[00:40:30]  Do you have your jacket?  Oh, hell no.  Let me say hi to...  Did you have a big H for Harmerfield?  I still have the big H.  I never put it on anything.  Did you wear it?  No.  Did you ever wear it?  Yeah.  I got the big H for being on a varsity team.  Should have been followed by IV.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  When running, he gets cramps.  The people call him Gramps.  Is that the name?  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Good job, guys.  Let's say hi to Alex in Jersey.  Alex.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  Yeah.  My gym teacher wouldn't pass me, so instead of going to summer school, I just dropped out  my senior year and got my GED.  Took the year off, went to college, and then I ran into him a couple years later, and he  shit his pants, but I told him not the money I was making.  Yeah, gym teachers make no money.  Oh, believe me, I never...  They were bitter, those guys.  I never bragged about anything, and I pretty much never had contact with these people, but 
[00:41:30]  they've heard.  I know a few people that I talk to that have talked to certain teachers that I went to  school with, and they've heard of my accomplishments throughout the years.  So, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry I didn't fucking get your diploma from your fucking school.  I think most teachers don't get it.  Like, they should be embracing people like yourself in high school, but instead...  Maybe I would have made a donation to their radio program. 
[00:42:00]  Maybe I would have.  Maybe that's what it'll take to get a diploma.  No way, no how.  I'll say, look, I'll make a donation to your radio program.  I know they had a radio program, and I'll say, yeah, I'll buy you some equipment with  this little donation.  You give me the old sheepskin, and we're fucking quid pro quo.  I got my diploma.  For what?  What do I need a fucking diploma for?  I got a GED three years after I got sober, which was probably I was about 21. 
[00:42:30]  I just didn't need it.  And that's not a diploma.  Yeah.  What a fucking diploma.  General equivalency.  General equivalency diploma.  I've never seen the phones lit like this to talk about gym.  We're talking about high school dropouts.  What do you think?  Our listeners are all calling.  Talk about men's.  I'll watch the phone fucking go blank.  Barry.  Yo.  Hey, Barry.  Hey, ma'am.  Now, check this one out.  Now, I'm a state champion and all that in track.  I'm the opposite of the guy who got the free ride from the gym teacher. 
[00:43:00]  I got failed.  I got an incomplete because I refused to take gym.  I refused.  So you got, here he is, Barry.  He's a great athlete and the gym teacher fucks him over.  Yeah.  Basically.  Don't you take Jim to be a better, I don't know, athlete or something?  Yeah, you would think.  But if you're already a great athlete, then why would you fail Jim because you're not really  going because you're a great athlete like playing on the team?  Right.  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, Barry's gone?  All right.  Whatever.  Let me say hi to Kirk in Kentucky. 
[00:43:30]  Kirk.  Yeah.  Guys, I'm 16.  I'm still a junior.  Okay.  Is that bad?  You got any advice on how to make it through the next two years.  I've been listening to your show since I was 12.  Well.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  This bitch.  Wait a minute.  There's freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.  Yes.  So you only have one more. 
[00:44:00]  No, junior.  I'll be a junior.  Oh, you'll be a junior.  Yeah, we're in summertime now, so that makes sense.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got junior and senior year to go.  Junior and senior.  You're 16, 17, 18.  Okay.  What kind of advice do you need?  Why?  Are you having trouble?  You seem to have made it so far pretty good.  I don't want to drop out and then you'll pick up some chicks.  Oh, well, then just leave.  Fuck it.  No, I've always regretted not graduating because it did hold me back for things I wanted to do. 
[00:44:30]  Not the high school diploma, but the need to have one in order to go to, like, college.  I would have done that now.  Yeah, I need to go to college.  Knowing what I know now, I would have done that.  Although I would have known that I would have gotten into radio, so I said fuck a lot earlier.  I think you wanted to go to college.  Yeah.  You like getting knowledge.  I wanted to go to college.  Did you really?  Actually, I wanted to, you know.  Get laid.  I wanted to go to, like, I wanted to be in the Rotsies. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, really?  I would have liked to have, you know, joined, like, officer school.  Officer training school.  Yeah, why didn't you join the military?  I was afraid.  For real?  No, because I fucked up in school and everything, and I knew I could just go in as an enlisted  guy like my brother did.  I wanted officer training.  Oh, I see.  So if you got the diploma, I would have had to have, you know, gone to school and shit.  I want your D-O-R.  D-O-R. 
[00:45:30]  Drunk on request.  I could do that for you, sir.  Oh, he's older than the teachers, and he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic.  He's Anthony.  He's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their hineys.  His big, delicious cock shouldn't be black.  It's not.  He's Anthony.  Oh, he carries a trapper keeper full of Hitler photographs. 
[00:46:00]  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He tries to be everyone's friend, but he gives all the girls the creeps.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Ivan, I'd like to request the Jamaican Jimmy talking to Big A about his marriage or somewhat 
[00:46:30]  marriage to that Jamaican girl for money.  Thank you.  Message deleted.  Here comes Big A.  He's strutting, too.  He is.  That's where the audience is supposed to clap.  Big A, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest on the show, Big A.  What a cocksmith.  Yeah.  What's up, Big A?  Now, to be familiar with Big A, Big A, he's a taxi driver, but not like one of those New 
[00:47:00]  York City taxi drivers.  I don't know what kind of shenanigans he's pulling or the company he works for, but it's  just a car.  It's like a, it's, I'm sorry, it's a shitty car that drives around and he picks people up  and they pay him money to take him places.  And you, you, uh, you drive in the Bronx?  Um, yes, I drive, I mean, our base is in the Bronx, but I drive all over, but the base  is in the Bronx. 
[00:47:30]  And, uh, did I mention he's got a speech impediment?  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot to mention, maybe that should have been first before the, what he does for a  living.  Uh, he, he has a big problem saying words that start with S-T.  Yeah, give him an S-T word, watch.  Like, stethoscope.  Go ahead there.  Stethoscope.  Um, um, um, um, s- uh, s- goes on.  Take your time.  Thanks for having trouble.  He just needs encouragement, that's all. 
[00:48:00]  Maybe he's saying it, would that help?  Some people, when they sing, they stutter better.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't tell us.  The doctor uses a stethoscope.  Yeah, go ahead.  Um, the doctor uses a stethoscope.  I think I can get through to that.  You said stethoscope.  You said stethoscope.  I don't know, I had trouble bouncing the word.  Try a different S-T word.  Oh, you want a different S-T word?  You have trouble what?  Pronouncing.  Yes.  That's the beauty of it.  We don't want to give you a good one.  Say this then. 
[00:48:30]  I'm shaped like a stegosaurus.  Go ahead.  I'm shaped like a stegosaurus.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  Isn't that rough?  Okay.  Well, that wasn't that bad.  The good news is the stegosaurus doesn't come up that much.  How often?  You can avoid it. 
[00:49:00]  I'll have the stegosaurus.  You never hear that.  All right.  Well, Big A was married.  We find out was married.  Now, this is very surprising.  How old were you when you were married?  It's not an S-T word.  I don't think any number starts with S-T. 
[00:49:30]  Steventeen.  Steventeen.  Ballpark.  How old a gentleman are you now?  That's good.  Forty.  Forty.  Approximately how many years ago did you get married?  Yeah, we'll do the math.  Are you sure this is a speech-related problem?  Let's get him more comfortable. 
[00:50:00]  Why don't you put your feet up?  Why don't you lean back?  Four KG.  Oh, that's a recliner.  Oh, cool.  Holy Jesus.  Wow.  That's great.  Wow.  You fill up that chair pretty good, buddy.  You certainly do.  All right.  So what?  Fourteen years ago you were married?  Someone fixed the lumbar on it.  It's pushing his belly out.  Oh, it doesn't have one.  All right, so around 26 you got married.  Fourteen years ago, right?  How long were you married for? 
[00:50:30]  About three years.  Three years?  That's relatively...  Is there a little big A running around out there?  No, no.  Oh, no kids.  Well, that would have been a coup.  So where did you meet the girl that you wound up marrying?  Oh, I met her up in Yonkers.  I'm glad it wasn't Staten Island. 
[00:51:00]  Where, Andrew?  Up in Yonkers.  No, okay, up in Yonkers.  And how did you first see her?  She was working at a Burger King.  And you what?  Went there a lot or you worked there too?  Oh, no, I was a customer.  Okay.  And she'd give you like an extra hat?  A little Burger King crown.  So she worked at Burger King. 
[00:51:30]  And what did she do there?  She was just a cash register girl?  I think she worked in the back.  So how did you finally meet her?  She took a break and...  And you duct taped her mouth shut and threw her in the trunk of your car.  You rolled her up in some indoor-outdoor carpeting.  Had her help him with a couch getting it in the van.  Would you help me with this?  My arm's broke.  Would you? 
[00:52:00]  So, okay, she took a break.  And you had seen her?  Did you guys make eye contact at each other?  Did you notice each other?  A couple times.  A couple of times.  Yeah.  Okay, so she takes a break and...  What'd she look like, by the way?  Oh.  Here's a little description of her.  Good question.  If she looked like a celebrity or if she looked like somebody we might know, size, shape, what'd  she look like?  Somebody that might have danced on a pole in the studio.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  How tall?  A little tall, I mean...  A little tall?  Andrew, relax.  No, no, no, no, no.  She's bigger than a bread box.  You'd make a great witness.  What'd she look like?  Oh, her head.  She was a little shorter than me.  Okay.  How tall are you?  About six foot, one, six, two.  All right, so was she what, six foot, or was she five, nine, five, seven? 
[00:53:00]  About five, seven, I think.  All right.  So you were a lot taller.  Yeah, a lot taller.  Color hair?  Dark.  Dark hair.  All right, wait, wait.  Was everything dark on her?  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Was she an African-American?  No.  No? 
[00:53:30]  She was from Trinidad.  Oh, so she was an African Trinidadian.  She wasn't, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, it's always, you know, shades of darkness,  of shades of black.  Oh, boy.  You're a racist.  I don't see skin color.  Yeah, right.  So I don't, uh...  You're right.  I don't.  Not in my neighborhood.  Everyone's white.  That's right. 
[00:54:00]  How black?  Halle Berry black?  Yeah.  Yes.  Grace Jones black?  Oh, no, no, no.  Wesley Snipes?  Did she look like she could run a marathon?  Hmm.  Actually, well, like...  Halle Berry.  All right, Halle Berry.  Not really dark, dark, you know, let's call her, like, brown. 
[00:54:30]  Not dark, but you could tell that it wasn't just somebody with a good tan.  She was a bit brown.  All right.  Nice body, nice booty.  What was your...  Nice.  What was the favorite part on her body for you?  Oh, her ass.  Was she a big girl, a small girl?  Not big at all, no.  She heavy?  No.  What did she say?  What would you say she weighed?  5'7 and...  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:55:00]  Like, a hundred and a quarter?  All right, buck and a quarter at 5'7.  Okay.  So, wow, kind of a thin girl there.  You guys made the number 10.  Yeah.  Well, how did you talk to her now?  You said she went on break, you had looked at each other.  This is your first shot at really talking to her.  Here's what happened.  We were just talking and getting to know each other and... 
[00:55:30]  What did you say to her when you approached her?  How did you approach her?  I was like, oh, 14 years ago, I don't... 
[00:56:00]  Sure you do.  You remember.  Of course you do.  No, you do remember.  Of course you do.  You do, like, shut up.  You do.  You remember how you met.  I understand.  You're embarrassed.  What happened?  Did you pay for it?  No, no.  Something's going on.  The Burger King.  How did you approach her?  What did you say?  You didn't just start talking to her?  A whopper, please.  Where's my fries, bitch? 
[00:56:30]  What happened?  Yeah, come on.  What did you say to her?  First time you...  What was the big A move?  Yeah.  First time you come in contact with her, how did you make the move to go further?  Come on.  Do you remember?  Open your mind.  Open your mind.  Did she take a thorn out of your foot?  What happened, Andrew? 
[00:57:00]  I guess we were just talking about movies and just talking about each other.  Just talking about each other.  Casual conversation.  But standing up or did you sit down at a table at Burger King?  Because if she works in the back, how did you get in the back?  If she works in the back, how did you get up front? 
[00:57:30]  If she takes a break, where'd she go?  How did you sit down?  These are the questions people want answers to.  Right?  You want answers to that.  Yeah, maybe I do.  All right.  So you meet her at Burger King.  You made some kind of move.  We'll never know what it is.  Because you don't remember?  How'd you ask her out for the first time?  How'd you say...  Where was your first date?  Yeah, there you go.  First date.  Did she talk like Miss Cleo?  Did she?  Did you have an accent? 
[00:58:00]  I see us getting married, man.  No, not like that, no.  Not like that at all.  Did she use you to stay in the country?  Was this a legitimate marriage?  Actually, it was legitimate.  I mean, she was getting the green card.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  How did you ask her out?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:58:30]  I just asked her if she wanted to see a movie.  Did you leave her a choice?  Of course I did.  What movie did you see?  What movie?  That I honestly forget.  Probably the one De Niro took his date to in Taxi Driver.  Do you remember your first kiss with her? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  So where was it?  Oh, yeah.  By the friolator.  I think it was in my car.  Oh.  Okay.  You had gone on your first date.  Mm-hmm.  You're dropping her off?  Yeah.  Okay.  What happened?  Were you talking?  Were you thinking you wanted to kiss her? 
[00:59:30]  I think it was more like a good night kiss, you know, a good time.  And a good night kiss.  All right.  But you started seeing each other more.  Got to step along with these goddamn stories, Jesus Christ.  Big A, come on.  So, Big A, you went out more with her, right?  Yeah.  More and more.  And then when did you realize that you wanted to marry this girl? 
[01:00:00]  How long after you met her?  Um, I think it was like a year.  So you've gone out for a year and you decide.  So you, did you pop the question?  You know.  Yes, I did.  You did.  Now, tell us a little about that.  How did that go?  Waiting for an answer. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  I was waiting for an answer any time.  This sucks.  How'd you do it?  You should just, like, when I say, so how did that go?  You should be like, well, I bought a ring at blah, blah, blah.  Then I went to this place and we did that.  You got to kind of, you know, you got to kind of give us a description.  Hold that mic yourself there.  There you go.  So what was the proposal like?  Describe the proposal as if you were describing it to somebody who was going to write a story 
[01:01:00]  or make a movie about it.  You need details.  Did you hide the ring in a fish witch?  No, you're not.  Actually, I was in a park.  Okay, you were in a park.  Did you have the ring with you?  Yeah, I had a ring with me.  Where did you get the ring? 
[01:01:30]  Penn Station?  I thought the thinker of a prostitute.  I forgot the place.  I got it.  You forgot the place.  You got it.  You don't remember much of anything about this, do you?  I was over 14 and he was a plane.  Yeah, I know.  I remember shit from 14 years ago.  Trying to forget?  Trying to forget.  How'd you ask her? 
[01:02:00]  That I know no one forgets.  Yeah, you're in the park.  You got the ring.  What'd you say?  Of course, my time came.  I know in front of her.  And I asked her if she wants to...  Go back to Trinidad?  Yeah, I had to stay here. 
[01:02:30]  Someone's suggesting that you bought an onion ring for her.  And then someone else is saying that interviewing Big A is like interviewing a rock.  It's true.  Big A, this was...  You know, people have been looking forward to this for a while now.  You're killing us.  You're in the park.  You got the ring.  You get down on an idiot.  What do you say to her?  This is a girl you've been kind of dating for a year, even though that's very suspicious at this point.  So you knelt down in front of her.  What'd you say? 
[01:03:00]  And I asked her if she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me.  She wanted to marry me.  And she said yes?  Yes.  So where did you get married?  Actually, it was up in Yonkers.  The romantic Yonkers.  Yeah, the wedding capital of the world, Yonkers. 
[01:03:30]  I love that.  Come to Yonkers.  Actually, it wasn't a full wedding.  It was just...  It's more of a rape.  A rape with flowers and a piece of cake.  How long did it take to propose?  As long as this interview?  Oh, no, no, no.  Were you really in love with her? 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  Because I was.  When did you realize she was using you?  Let's get to the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or actually, how was the wedding?  Who was there?  Your parents?  Actually, no one.  It was at a judge's house.  Oh, you did one of those judge things where you'd just both go there.  Didn't you need a witness or something?  Um.  Her witch doctor.  So you had no friends or family with you?  Nobody.  No, no. 
[01:04:30]  It was just me and at a judge's house.  So did you go on any type of honeymoon or anything?  What did you do after?  Did you go celebrate somewhere?  Well.  The Bronx.  We didn't have, you know, time or money.  Went to Jamaica.  Queens.  Actually, we did go up to Trinidad.  Oh.  How did you go up to Trinidad? 
[01:05:00]  It's a long flight.  It's a real long flight.  To meet her family?  Yes.  And what did they think of you?  Actually, they liked me.  How many goats did you have to give them?  Isn't that like something?  Dowry or whatever it's called.  You got to give her some goats.  Give the family goats.  Wait.  When she brought you to meet her family, did her father, like, put a harness on you and 
[01:05:30]  asked to help pull something through a field?  Um.  No, actually.  No, no.  A lot of people are saying that you're full of shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Why would he be doing that?  What are you not telling, Big A?  Something's up here.  Yeah, you're not telling something.  Yeah.  Did he get paid to marry her or something?  Hmm.  One of those Bronx scams. 
[01:06:00]  Ooh.  I'm on to something.  What is it?  Ooh, I'm on to something.  He's giving me that evil eye.  Well, no, he's not.  He knows.  You're embarrassing.  Little flip.  Free appetizer.  F.H.  Riley's on the way for the right answer.  Wow.  I hit a nerve.  The Bronx is filled with scams all over the neighborhoods, man.  Mm-hmm.  Is this one of these scams? 
[01:06:30]  Did you get paid to marry her?  Come on.  How much?  Ooh, he's giving me the eye.  A couple of bucks.  Just don't strangle me, man.  Andrew, how much?  Andrew, a couple of bucks, right?  It happens.  They got to stay in the country.  We just got a little nod from him.  Yeah.  Was it, like, how much?  Did it set you up a little bit, or?  Oh, yeah, a little bit, yes.  Yeah.  More than a thousand? 
[01:07:00]  That's why he doesn't know how he approached her.  Right, right.  What kind of dates he went on.  This was just...  Because this was an arranged thing.  Yeah.  One of his buddies went, hey, you want to make a few easy dollars?  You marry this broad.  Go to the judge's house.  She needs to be in the...  She needs to be married for, what is it, two years?  And then she's free to go, right?  Did a buddy come up to you, one of your pals in the neighborhood, and say, hey, you want  to make a few bucks?  You never went to Trinidad. 
[01:07:30]  That's obvious.  I mean, what are you kidding?  Actually, I think I...  You went to Trinidad?  When the INS was questioning you, did they just give up in frustration?  Don't they usually, like, separate the couple and say, are they on which side of the bed,  you know, to make sure it's a legitimate marriage?  That's only...  That's only if they don't believe you.  Well, why would they not believe you, Adam?  You know, this is...  No, no, no.  Only if...  It does happen.  Yeah.  But this seemed a little fishy to begin with, so you would think that they would question 
[01:08:00]  it, I would think.  Now, did you know, so you were going to make some money to marry her, so you marry her,  but did you wind up falling for her?  Yes, I did.  Oh, boy.  Did she fall for you, honestly?  A little bit, yes.  Okay.  A little bit.  So, how long were you married?  Three years.  Three years.  And how did it come to an end?  Uh, we were always arguing, but money, you know, it's always, uh, it was always an argument 
[01:08:30]  over, over money, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh, and, uh, and it just got too, too much.  You know, you know, uh, actually, we, actually, the last, uh, that happened, I was at, I was 
[01:09:00]  at a Met game, my parents and a friend of mine, and, and I called her up and she says,  oh, what time are you going to be home?  I'm like, I don't know if the game's over, you know, um, and, and she, you know, getting  agitated, and, and she was like, oh, oh, you're not here at a certain time, or your fingers  are going to be thrown out.  Oh, boy. 
[01:09:30]  Uh, I was like, this is, you know, you know, uh, extra innings, Mets fault.  You know, like, this is bull shit, so, um, I came back, um, from a baseball game, and  I called, uh, called the cops.  Mets win?  Uh, I don't know.  Just thought I'd ask.  Why'd you call the cops?  Um, get my things out. 
[01:10:00]  She was throwing you out?  Um, no, she wasn't throwing me out, but I just, I wanted to take my things, and, and I  didn't trust her anymore, um, you know, to do anything, you know, to claim anything.  Had you ever caught her stealing from you?  Oh, no, no.  But you thought she was going to, like, say that that was your, hers or something, if  you, no, no, not that, um, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, I just 
[01:10:30]  need to cover, you know, myself, because if the cops came, you know, they'll be watching,  and, and, you know, you know, so she can't claim I touched or anything.  Ah, there you go.  That's a smart move.  And, and, and that's how it ended.  Did I, did she get the best of you in an argument?  I can't even imagine Big A in the middle of an argument.  Well, you're a boo-boo. 
[01:11:00]  I know, you can get, like, three, three hundred, you fucking assholes in.  And before you say, well, you're a bitch.  Yeah.  I want to get back to this, though, man.  How did they set up this arranged marriage?  One of your buddies from the neighborhood?  Fellow taxi driver?  Yeah.  How did you find out about this?  And how much did you get to marry this broad?  And how much?  Well, actually, yes, not enough, huh?  Not enough?  More than 5,000?  Um, less. 
[01:11:30]  Uh, 3,000.  Oh, yes.  3,000.  So a guy comes up to you, he goes, hey, you know that chicken Burger King in Yonkers?  She needs to stay in this country.  And, uh, we're looking for someone to marry her.  Here's $3,000.  That's it, right?  All you gotta do.  And you took a look and went, ah, she's pretty cute, all right.  And I could use the money.  And I'm not getting dates.  Did you get to have sex?  Yeah, definitely, that's what I mean.  How often did you fuck?  Uh, actually, we had sex almost every night. 
[01:12:00]  Really?  Yeah, so it wasn't just, you know, money.  As I said before, it did turn into, you know, love.  We did have sex.  I believe him.  I know how to read Big A.  I believe him on this one.  Because when you call him on something, he gives you the look like he's gonna fucking kill you.  Yeah.  He's given me that look many, many times.  I believe you. 
[01:12:30]  So, so the cops come, you get your stuff out.  Did you exchange any nasty words?  Um, no, not at all.  I think she knew better, you know.  You know, the cops, it was, you know, actually, it was really quiet.  And it was...  His right leg is really going now.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if that's what his tells are.  He just, he's got a couple of tells, yeah.  It was just...  The fingers going. 
[01:13:00]  Jay Peterson, uh, oh, this is hard to sit through than a 9-11 mon die.  Oof.  Ties to me.  And then, dog shit sniffer from Woodside.  And what lasted longer, your marriage or this blurry story about it?  Was that the last time you saw her?  Yeah, did she...  Someone is asking a pretty good question.  Did she work off her debt through sex?  Like, what do you get out of this, besides the $3,000? 
[01:13:30]  Um, I also...  I also...  I also had sex with her.  Now, how does she repay the debt?  Well, she had to pay some other dude, obviously.  That's what I'm saying.  Was she sleeping with somebody else?  Nothing I know of.  Was she a hooker?  No, no, she was not.  Mm-hmm.  When's the last time you saw her? 
[01:14:00]  Um, years ago.  I used to be friends with her sister.  Almost contact.  Mm-hmm.  With her sister and...  Do you wonder what happened to her?  Oh, yeah, kind of, you know.  You know, sometimes, I mean, I don't... 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it's so hard.  How about right now, Big A, because we'd like to bring in right now your wife.  That's right!  Hey!  Come on in!  I'm teasing, of course.  Look at the fear in his eyes.  Yeah, for a second, he was...  I thought she was dead!  He was a little scared.  She clawed her way out of that shallow grave.  But I killed her, and...  Wow, the look on your face.  Now we're on to something else here.  Big A, uh...  What would she say to you if you saw her?  Like, there's something going on. 
[01:15:00]  Nothing.  I know.  Boy, you sure got fat.  No?  Yeah, you were a lot trimmer back then, I would gather.  A little trimmer, yes.  What did her accent sound like?  There wasn't much of it.  Oh, my God.  The instant beam, that's amazing.  Actually, there wasn't much of it.  There's a hammer in them. 
[01:15:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Did he stick that horrible excuse for a penis up her ass?  So, sorry, Big A.  Did you guys have anal sex?  Philly Tyrant...  One time.  One time?  Wait, before these fly away, Philly Tyrant writes,  Lost contact equals witness protection.  And then Snapman writes,  Forget when he last saw her.  Has anyone else seen her since they broke up?  Now, rumor has it, tell me if this is true, 
[01:16:00]  you never got divorced.  First, so officially, you're still a married man.  Um, yes.  Wow.  Right.  Married man, are you?  That means Stalker Patty was fooling around with a married man.  A married man.  You whore.  What'd you impact?  You homewrecker.  That's right, you guys went out. 
[01:16:30]  Wow, that is some couple.  That is...  Yeah, they went...  You should have seen it.  We videotaped it.  They went to a...  There's no Brangelina, I can tell you that.  What did they go to a fair?  Yeah.  And they went to get on the Ferris wheel together  to have, like, a good time.  And they made him get off and get in his own car  because the two of them would have been too heavy.  Were you embarrassed when they did that?  So the first wheel went around...  Yes, it was.  ...and they had individual cars. 
[01:17:00]  The guy came over and he said,  Sir, you're going to have to get off because you're too heavy?  Yeah, it was too much.  That's weight.  That's humiliating, right?  Wait, where was this?  A little.  That's a San Gennaro piece.  Yeah.  What car?  Wait, what I just...  There's the Ferris wheel.  Oh, the Ferris wheel you couldn't get in the Ferris wheel.  Oh, okay.  What were you thinking when you said that to you?  Like, yes, in your own car?  It's sad.  It's sad to go and change cars. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, I am a big gentleman and it doesn't happen.  You know what we call a gentleman?  Big gentleman?  Is that a...  How do you say that?  Excuse me, sir.  I don't know how quite to say this, but...  The Ferris wheel is not designed for a man.  You're obvious.  They might not hear me over the sound of busting cogs and chains,  but you're going to have to move. 
[01:18:00]  Rivets popping all over the place.  So, I guess that's all we're going to get out of Big A for now.  I mean, this is a developing story on the show.  We'll get more when we...  Jesus.  It was an arranged marriage.  Have another 12 hours.  It was one of those scams that happens in the Bronx.  Yep.  We learned about a lot of these scams through Old Dirty, one of our old friends there.  Yep.  He knew about all these.  You guys in the Bronx know how to make money, man.  There's all sorts of scams going on.  You had sex with her a lot.  Yes.  You tried the anal once.  What happened with that? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, she told me it hurt too much.  Oh, Big A.  Look at you.  Wow.  Fucking putting it right up, that dumper.  Good boy.  Bet you did that on the wedding night, didn't you?  Sure.  Right in the judge's bathroom.  Fucking mushed her head into the guest soap.  I'm thinking her anus is as big as a mosquito's.  Yeah, that's a tiny little ass.  She probably fucked her ass a whole bunch of other times.  She just never knew it.  Andrew, why are you on my back again? 
[01:19:00]  That'd be an exit, not an entrance.  Don't do it that way, love.  Why did you go to Trinidad if it was an arranged marriage?  Yeah, why'd you meet the...  To meet her handlers?  Actually, I felt for her.  I was meeting her parents.  Did they like you?  Yeah.  Did you stutter as much back then, or do you stutter more now? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, actually, I'm not in here or talking on the phone.  Actually, I do talk much better.  Is it true you used to talk perfectly, but because of one of these domestic squabbles,  she hits you over the head with a frying pan?  With a conch shell.  Actually, she never hit me.  With some chicken bones.  Actually, she never hit me, but I was always worried, because Trinidadian is very hot-blooded. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's why they make a good fuck, but also a violent temper.  They're calling you a cocksmith online, though.  That's good.  Yeah.  You'd probably fucking swing that cock like Buford Pusser.  Give her fucking asshole a good lesson.  Teach her a lesson.  I hear you.  Straighten it out.  Look, she might have left you, but she can never take away that you put it in her ass.  There you go.  She's got...  She'll remember that one. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  Every time she...  And they can't take away from you.  Every time she tries to sit down, I tell you.  Andrew, that's only for sitting and shit, and what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  You're exhausting, Big A.  That's fucking great.  Did she give you a head and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Did she come in her mouth?  Actually, she didn't swallow.  No.  No.  I prefer the jerk chicken.  You can't swallow if you've got to hold your nose. 
[01:21:00]  No, you shouldn't.  That's the only reason to embarrass Sandra.  I'm sorry, Big A.  That was a smelly ball joke.  I went too far.  I was lingering longer for people.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't have told her that you were going to come and then just grab her fucking hair  and say, for three grand, you're fucking taking this.  Well, you should have made her suck your dick down by the docks and, like, just nod your  head towards the water.  Like, we could send you back.  Actually, actually, the best time, I was driving the Yonkers. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, because I'm a roadhead.  Yeah?  Very exciting.  Really?  Yeah, as you're driving?  Just slobbering on it in the fucking car?  Wow.  When the author knew she was driving.  I was driving.  What did you threaten her?  Sucking his dick like a roach.  She held it with roach clips.  She put his dick in the ashtray when she was finished.  Yeah, I'm sorry, Andrew.  What did you threaten her with to get that done? 
[01:22:00]  Nothing.  Deportation?  No.  Stepped on the gas.  He's doing 100 toward an abutment.  Right.  Suck it or I hit this.  Hey, Puddle of Aids, he writes, this story's just like Pretty Woman, minus the millionaire  and the perfect diction.  Well, big A, man.  All right.  So you were married for three years.  Still married.  Still married, I hear.  You fucked her in every hole she had. 
[01:22:30]  You made a few bucks.  You're fucking, you're done now, you got your shit.  You went to some Met games.  Could have been worse.  Could have been worse.  I saw the ball club.  Are you leaving anything out?  Of course he is.  Yeah, you're leaving a lot out.  Yeah, there's something about the trip to Trinidad.  I think that might have been a money exchange point or something.  Was it a money exchange?  Yeah, why Trinidad?  I don't think she was interested in you as a person. 
[01:23:00]  Sorry.  You were just a ticket into the old U.S. of A.  Did that hurt you when you kind of realized that?  Yeah, definitely.  It was the trip for a vacation.  When did you realize, though, that she really opened up before?  When did you realize that I have fallen in love, and she may have, but not to the extent  that I have?  When did you realize it was unbalanced?  I think there was definitely at least some reciprocation.  Oh, sure.  I mean, she did let him put it in the back. 
[01:23:30]  You don't know the circumstances.  She could have been drunk.  She could have been vomiting in the toilet at the time and snuck up behind her.  He could have been heimlicking her.  So, when did you realize you had more invested mentally and emotionally than she did?  Oh, yeah.  Good question.  Oh, but you...  You never been...  Did you suspect she was seeing other men?  Yeah, she was.  Men more endowed than you, perhaps? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  She should have been any man in the neighborhood.  She was.  I could see it in his eyes.  People are asking, when you got road head, was the head attached, or had you...  Yes, it was.  Oh, okay.  Yes, it was.  I'm just wondering.  Yes, it was.  So are other people.  And to answer Jimmy's question, after he...  She realized after she said, I do.  On the way back from Yonkers.  Right.  Before the...  She closed the door after...  Oh, my God.  What did I do?  The man don't say a word quickly. 
[01:24:30]  The man say...  S.T. words too slowly.  Him go stir, stir, stir, and nothing come out after.  The man's balls smell like Elizabeth, New Jersey.  I'm going to try to put it in my backside.  It won't even hurt.  I'm going to try to shit on it to discourage him.  I'm always wearing the Burger King crown, trying to recapture the magic. 
[01:25:00]  I'm not amused by this bit at all.  No, he's not.  I'm not happy at all.  When she was giving you a road head, did she pop up and go, I didn't know we were in Staten Island?  That's a garbage joke, you know, because it smells like that.  What is that?  Sorry.  Sorry, sweaty ball joke again.  I can't help myself.  I can't talk to him on the phone. 
[01:25:30]  My whole phone card is no good no more because him trying to say stairs.  Him have to point and go to upsy things.  People love a Jamaican jibby.  You're not Jamaican, me Trinidadian.  It don't matter.  I know.  She had to go to Trinidad to mule back smack to pay off her debt. 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  Squarehead.  Him so stupid, me asked him to carry what me told him was domino sugar in his backside.  And him did it in balloons.  His backside is so big, him carry 11 kilograms.  The only reason she accepted an ass fucking from you, Big A, was just to, you know, stretch out her ass.  So she had mule back more drugs. 
[01:26:30]  But him not well endowed enough to stretch it out.  Me could only put back two sprinkles of coca.  Not even enough to get high on.  It melted in me asshole in the airport.  It hurt just putting a joint up there.  Not even one of those Big Bob Marley ones.  Me wasn't happy with the size of his penis.  I had to start seeing a five-year-old in the neighborhood to make it up.  After him fucking me in the ass, I couldn't mule a Xanax. 
[01:27:00]  I was hoping for a kilo.  The man always getting stopped by customs because him can't talk right.  They think he hiding something.  There was a little Irish in that last one, Jimmy.  Yes.  I mean, not that good.  The customs man asks where he from.  And after United, it takes a half hour. 
[01:27:30]  No one breathes when you talk.  The man tried to talk and everybody can't breathe.  While Turkey writes, the reason why his dick is so small is because he shrunk the head.  Me put...  Me put...  Me put the progeria curse on him penis.  He wanted to put it in the backside.  He's going to wake up with a surprise.  I roll the bones.  Make the small dick. 
[01:28:00]  I make a fat doll and I put pins in it.  Holy shit.  Turn his penis into a shrinky dink.  Oh my God.  His penis looked like that thing you put in the oven.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, his patient's wearing thin on this one, isn't it?  Yeah.  Hey, is that my fucking egg sandwich from two hours ago?  Oh, no.  God damn it, I'm starving.  That's not going to be good.  Speaking of egg sandwiches, he likes his balls licked. 
[01:28:30]  Ha ha ha.  It was a rotten egg sandwich.  See what we're trying to say today, Big A, you got some sweaty, smelly balls.  His balls smell like a catalytic converter.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Oh my goodness, man.  Uh, someone being dishonest, uh, the show is blowing goat scrotum today. 
[01:29:00]  Are you kidding me?  Fucking Jamaican...  Speaking of goat scrotum, me gave him road head one time.  Ha ha ha.  Him like his goatish balls licked.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Oh my God.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  That is funny, Big A.  Ha ha ha.  So we'll get, we'll, uh, get more out of him.  Him have shoes like fat muffins.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  The police showed up.  I taught it was Mr. Met.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  I think we're in a good place. 
[01:29:30]  We got a lot out of him.  Uh, yeah.  This is, uh, this story's gonna have legs.  Yeah, I think so.  Oh my God.  Her with her, um, she's still married.  That's, that amazes me.  And you don't know where she is now.  Just somewhere out there.  Still an American citizen, I guess.  Someone is asking, well, Philly Tyrant, he's, uh, he's a faithful listener.  And he writes, uh, what smells worse, his balls or, or her corpse? 
[01:30:00]  See, cause.  That was just hurtful.  Well, people think you might've killed her.  You want him to state, state, uh, for the record that that's not true?  Um, that's not true.  I did not kill anybody.  We made a honeymoon video.  It was called The Serpent and the Rainbow.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Him fall asleep and he put a tarantula on his face.  Ha ha ha.  He brought powder in his face. 
[01:30:30]  Ha ha ha.  Did she ever, uh, work your pooper?  Any digits ever, uh, no.  What'd she do to you?  What was this freakiest thing she did to you?  Come on, she had to pull something out of you.  She learned about the old country.  Trinidad freaky shit.  Yeah, they got some freaky shit down there, right?  Did you jerk off while she danced around your supine body like Chief J Strongbow?  Ha ha ha.  No, I did not, no. 
[01:31:00]  Well, he didn't really need an answer there, Big A.  Oh, yeah.  Big A.  Hey, fucking, fucking, fucking A.  We love you, so it's very interesting to hear about your life.  We know you a long time.  I know, like, Ron and Fez have the Big A, but we want to start, fucking A, it's Big A.  Wow, I like that one.  I think my brother's going to make a t-shirt and everything.  Fucking A, it's Big A.  Fucking A, it's Big A.  What do you got now, Ronnie?  What do you got now?  Did you ever, did you ever strap on a dildo and say, one good turn deserves another?  Ha ha ha. 
[01:31:30]  Ha ha ha.  The Big A, and A is for ass sex, right?  It's heard about this fair play.  What's good for the goose, it's good for the elephant.  Ha ha ha.  Well, the record, you're not as big as an elephant, but it's more of that exaggerated humor that  Stalk and Patty got into it.  Yeah, 11,000 TVs.  Fair play.  11,000 TVs? 
[01:32:00]  11,000.  You're on that one up there.  You look good, my camera.  Yeah.  You do, actually.  Your hair's all looking like fucking slicked back cool.  Yeah, you look like a mobster.  Did you toss it on your mouth or is that a sore?  Uh, sore.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  Someone punch you and rob you?  No.  Cab money?  No.  Me put the hex.  Me put the hex.  The hex.  Me told him, me cut me pussy lip shave, and we all know what that one was.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha. 
[01:32:30]  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  So is it, uh, are you a little herpes on it?  No.  Oh, no.  Mmm.  I worry about it.  Something going on there.  I worry about that.  What that is.  All muffin feet.  Is it a cold sore?  Big soft shoes.  Let's have a man come in to the order of fish with sandwich.  What's up with the lip?  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  And he asked me on a date.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Just a cold sore.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  No food around?  You try to eat yourself?  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  He didn't want to go on a date with him. 
[01:33:00]  Ha ha ha.  That's it.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  There's no punchline.  Ha ha ha.  And to the instant feedback, it'd say I sound like a Jamaican leprechaun.  Die in a boat accident.  Ha ha ha.  Always after me, Lucky Charles.  That's right.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  His balls are magically awful.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Green garbage.  Red bodies.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Blue feet.  Ha ha ha. 
[01:33:30]  Ha ha ha.  You ever eat a rat?  Ha ha ha.  Um...  No, I do not.  Land of opportunity.  Opportunity gets fucked by a...  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, go ahead and say it.  By a...  By a...  By a...  By a stuttering.  Me come to the land of milking honey and get me asshole filled by a stuttering monolith.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Him have the biggest, longest shoelaces I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:34:00]  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  What, are you gonna jump rope with those shoelaces later?  What's up?  Ridiculous.  All right.  We have to stop.  As we were running this one into the ground.  Ha ha ha.  But it's fun to do.  Of course.  Well, we had to get something out of this.  We certainly did.  You told me the streets were paved with gold, but my asshole is paved with semen.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah, you blow a load at her?  Nice.  Yes, I did.  No bag?  Was she on the pill or something?  No. 
[01:34:30]  No.  How'd you know she wasn't gonna get pregnant?  You probably wanted her to.  Would it come out?  Yeah.  Did she have a baby?  It reminds me of Jimmy's old bit.  He'd go to hangers close up.  They would just fall to the ground because all the hangers were gone.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I took care of the baby.  Ha ha.  Everything is taken care of.  Don't worry.  The beauty of me is you...  What's the joke, Jimmy?  The beauty of me is, uh...  Um...  Um...  You...  You're gonna find...  Oh, whatever.  You're gonna find me special hanger.

[01:40:00]  this is robert from arizona i'd love to hear anthony talking about invading venezuela  that was some of the greatest shit ever heard thank you message deleted  more state of the union  the president from last night another taste last month osama bin laden released a tape in which  he railed against iraqi tribal leaders people said they have turned on al-qaeda  and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in iraq 
[01:40:30]  ladies and gentlemen some may deny the surge is working  but among the terrorists there is no doubt  al-qaeda is on the run in iraq and this enemy  will be defeated  they sure started stopped clapping abruptly  american troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with iraqi forces  and eventually to a protective overwatch mission 
[01:41:00]  as part of this transition one army brigade combat team  and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home  and will not be replaced  one soldier  in the coming months four additional brigades and two marine battalions will follow suit  taken together  this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home  iraq  all right so 20,000 guys are coming home  yeah  when are the iraqis going to take over their own country 
[01:41:30]  i was reading that they're doing that  they admitted that they're not going to be able to  until we want by the end of the year i believe  and uh they're saying over there uh somewhere between 2010 and 2012  they feel they'll be ready  yeah  they that's what they're saying over there  how come all the time that we were going to attack them they were all ready  they were going to kick our ass  how come now uh they can't be trained 
[01:42:00]  they're all corrupt  the police department's selling our guys out  dude it's the wild wild west  it's just a mess  the whole area is the wild wild west  they got to figure it out  all right ready  it's going to take a long time  can i get some white uh help from this  uh yes patrice  why the fuck  okay we know we know the underlying belief that is about other things  but let's say if we were this was all genuine this whole thing  why are we oh what what is would that eventually affect us 
[01:42:30]  if we disminded our fucking business  oh if we uh  if we just didn't  if we never did this  if we never did anything with iraq  if we just if we just left fuckers alone  because it's it why eventually would that fuck with us  well then they would have uh as saddam was saying annexed uh kuwait  and then um saudi arabia was also on on his hit list  okay uh there wouldn't have been a first gulf war 
[01:43:00]  so he still would have had a pretty strong army  and he was kind of a nut  you know it was proven that he would go into other countries  and take whatever he wanted  okay  so if we didn't get involved  i guess he'd be free to just do that  and remember supergroups  and if he did that  and if he did that  it would uh destabilize the area that we depend on for oil  which is already you know  not that stable anyway  which is all of it ends up being all about oil again  yeah it is  the only reason we give a shit about the middle east  is because of oil 
[01:43:30]  i've never heard anybody say that though  i've never heard a fucking president  but but you know what it is  you hear people say it  but they put it  they put it in this context of  you just see some stupid college douche saying  it's about the oil man  and it's like  and they try to say  it's about the oil as far as money goes  uh and people in these oil companies making money  no it has to do with  we need that shit  to run our shit  so  we need that area  to be as stable  as it possibly can be  and that's the only reason we're there  there are destabilized 
[01:44:00]  nations all over the world  why the fuck aren't we there  why aren't we in a lot of these countries in africa  that are just  upside down  with people chopping each other up  with machetes  you know what  we don't care about the people  their freedoms  if there's an asset  that we need  as a country  to survive  then we're gonna uh fight  to keep it stable  it's that's not a wrong thing either  why the fuck should we give up  uh oil  that runs everywhere  you like the lights  you like fucking driving  you like stuff like that  then we gotta shoot some people 
[01:44:30]  it's just the way  the world works right now  maybe in the future  it'll be different  you like lights motherfucker  that's what it is  remember super groups  super groups  yeah you don't want them  to become a super uh country  a super country  right right  you don't want any one  super country  over there in the middle east  to destabilize everything  where they all get together  and become one big super country  that's why  having israel there  is a fucking monkey wrench  in the whole works  because it kind of gives  democracies 
[01:45:00]  excuses  to say  hey what the fuck  are you doing  to a lot of these  uh arab countries  it's like come on  it's israel  they're just trying to live free  and i don't know  if that many americans  really  except for uh jewish people  but i don't think a lot of americans  really care about israel  as an ally  or a sovereign nation  as they do with  keeping some kind of  a foothold  and stability  and uh  american  ally  over there  in in the middle east  or else we're 
[01:45:30]  fucked  over oil  over the fucking  yeah  that's all  it's the shit in the ground  you think if that oil  wasn't on the ground  why would we want  a fucking sandy  dusty place  with people that don't know  how to wipe their asses  and houses that look like  the flintstones house  why would we  ever want to defend that  go there  fight for them  do anything  the oil is very important  to our economy  we need oil  we love this country  runs on it  texas and venezuela  not enough  people at venezuela  i think 
[01:46:00]  we should  invade venezuela  they have a shitload of oil  and  venezuela  not many strong allies  russia they do  but russia's fucking  they are  they're giving oil  except for us  to us  they hate us  they hate us  but you know something  maybe  if we wanted to go down there  start some shit  maybe we could make it look like  they started some shit  and then we could fuck them up  and  and really  not like the middle east  just 
[01:46:30]  legitimately take their oil  set up a pipeline  and just ship it up here  as much shit  that's happened  and i mean  i think as much shit  has happened  i think if we did  something like that  it will be forgotten  and forgiven  in a few years  if we just went in  took venezuela's oil  left  said nothing else  the world was upset  and everybody was  oh yeah  there'd be condemnation  in the u.n  just was fucking quiet  don't go to venezuela  it's very dangerous  for americans  to go to venezuela  and just hang out  for a minute 
[01:47:00]  no wars  no bullshit  they'll forget it  and it'll be fine  and then we'd  have cheap oil  let's go to jason  clifton  with the arabs  jason  hey what's going on  good morning  what's up  my main argument  is being that  we are in the east  for the oil  don't you think  more or less  the fact  we're spending  more money  on going out  fighting for war  fighting for the oil  that's out there  as opposed to  spending more money  and more resources  into looking for  outside ways  to get this country running 
[01:47:30]  we don't have any  alternative  or outside ways  right now  we are based  in fucking oil  i'd say this  the day the oil  ran out  when we turn on  the oil faucet  in this country  and nothing comes out  you will see  a super genius  the next week  invent something  that works  just like oil  i'm trying to  but it just  why can't we run  just things like  seawater  like what  we don't have to  because there's oil  right  oil  everything's piped 
[01:48:00]  for oil  everything's made for  all the cars out there  are made for  petroleum based  machines  hold on  hold on  go with that thought  though  anthony's right  but you can't just  you can't go from  a country that  depends on oil  to a country  that depends on  sunflower seeds  we went  no seriously  if you read about  this stuff  on any level  if you do that  drastically  the entire economy  will collapse  no matter what 
[01:48:30]  you decide  you need to do  it has to be a slow  fade in  complete industries  would be destroyed  which would completely  destroy our economy  that's why we don't  go right to electric cars  or right to  fucking  peanut butter  and your gas tags  whatever the fuck  it's going to be  whatever they're doing  taking oil  from french fries  and putting it  in a motor  it's got to be  a slow process  why can't we just  we went from  8 tracks  to cassettes  overnight  and cassettes  to see  I'm not even trying 
[01:49:00]  to module  but the shock  of that  because I was  an anti-CD guy  now you don't  see cassettes  and things like that  matter of fact  even saying CDs  you know  the world wasn't  the world wasn't  you know  the United States  especially  it wasn't based  on cassette tapes  because of iPods  and all that shit  right  yeah I mean  I look at my CDs  I was unpacking boxes  the other day  I'm like  what the fuck  am I going to do  with these things  you're fucking right  but what I'm saying  is why can't we  just go fuck that 
[01:49:30]  look oil  we're killing  everybody for oil  the shit is  fucking the earth up  you know  let's just make  peanut butter run  engines  they are  but they're not  but they can't  just switch over  that overnight  why  it would destroy  the economy  I'm not  why  everything  but why  do you know  what it would  take  okay  okay  could you see  having every  major  major  every single  automotive  company  have to  retool  everything  to now run 
[01:50:00]  on the peanut  butter  yes  no  you wouldn't  have to  fire  it would cost  a fortune  of course  you would  have to  fire people  where's this  front money  coming from  let's say  let's say  Michigan  alright  you got the  car thing  happening  Detroit  and Michigan  and all that  right  let's make  believe Sacramento  becomes the  peanut butter  running  you know  car running  I love that  it's peanut butter  now  and it stays  peanut butter  also now  you are  completely  shutting down  Michigan  completely  yeah  Detroit 
[01:50:30]  is just  now it's  completely  has to be  like just  fenced in  and gone  the economy  would completely  collapse in that  area  but wouldn't  that area  wouldn't  wouldn't  the car  people  or whoever  had to make  things to run  on peanut  butter  right  yeah  wouldn't they  just say  okay everybody  we're starting  to make this  turn into  peanut butter  and they keep  their jobs  and you just  teach them  how to  make peanut  that's what we're  doing about  every house  that runs on  oil heat  now has to  have furnaces  that run on  peanut butter  now you gotta 
[01:51:00]  set up peanut  butter delivery  companies  that deliver  that they come  with the big  peanut butter  truck  oh my god  yeah that's true  so how much  how long  does it take  to transition  us out of  oil  that's what  we're doing  slowly but I  don't think  we're gonna  see it in our  lifetime  they're going  until it gets  too out of  control  where  they're doing  it slowly but  surely with  the electric  cars and  all that  and trying  to figure  that shit  out  they got  like hybrid  hydrogen vehicles  now and  you can't  do it overnight  though the  economy will 
[01:51:30]  collapse  we need an  expert in here  to completely  explain this  point  they're not  doing  they're not  like  they're not  being stubborn  about the  whole thing  it's about  the almighty  dollar  and they know  that would  just be  horrible for  our economy  it's a weird  transitional period  right now  where oil  isn't scarce  enough yet  and the price  isn't high  enough yet  it's still 
[01:52:00]  available  it was 99  cents a year  ago  two years ago  maybe  99  I mean gas  was 99  cents  well it was  in the 30s  per barrel  not long ago  at all  and then it  shot up to  just about  a hundred  dollars a  barrel  in a very  short period  of time  but they say  that it's  still on par  with 70s  gas prices  if they gave  you an  Escalade  right  said Anthony  we got  this peanut  butter Escalade  and all you  got to do  is fill it 
[01:52:30]  with three  you can drive  a hundred  miles  on three  16 ounce  jars of  Jiffy  yeah  yeah  and you  got the  test model  would you  would you  drive around  in a peanut  butter  in a peanut  butter  mobile  yeah  does it  does it  does it  have the  pickup  that mine  has  it  okay let's  figure out  what  okay  a peanut  butter  car  would probably  not  navigation  because it  doesn't have  the exhaust  you probably  have to  pull over 
[01:53:00]  okay you have  to pull over  every 15  miles  to let  the peanut  butter  re  cook  every 15  miles  take your  fucking  peanut butter  Escalade  and shove  it up  your ass  because I  ain't driving  every 15  miles  you gotta  let it  reap  peanut butter  you just  have to  plan your  peanut butter  drives  a little  difference  throw that  vehicle into  the jelly  pit  oh that's  it  listen to me  George Washington  Carver  take your 
[01:53:30]  fucking  yeah  yeah  because no one  wants to be  inconvenienced  too much  that's  that's  inconvenient  yeah you  don't want to be  inconvenienced  too much  either  so you  know  if all of a sudden  they're saying  a jar of peanut  butter and nothing  else is going to  change you just  gotta maybe scoop  some peanut butter  in your thing  every once in a while  then why not  that's great  if you're changing  all kinds of  stuff and  your house has to  run on peanut  butter  you have to do  a full peanut  butter  because when it  gets old it  loses some of  its peanut butter  you got it  every five months 
[01:54:00]  you have to do  a full peanut  butter  diagnose  you have to  get it all  out  and read  it's a couple  of things  that's inconvenient  but it's just  like driving  an electric car  you gotta plug  your fucking  car in  that's ridiculous  and you don't  know where  the fuck  plugs are  so you have  to make sure  you drive  where there's  plugs gonna  be  and that's  another thing  what do you  think  that juice  coming out  of the wall  is free  when you're  charging your  vehicle  it's still  using your  electric  so you're 
[01:54:30]  gonna be  billed for  that anyway  so is it  more economical  than gas  than a different  type of  hybrid  it's more  safe  is it  is it  really  in terms  of the  environment  oh  is it  where do you  think that  energy comes  from that's  going into  your fucking  into your  wall socket  there's a big  generator that's  gotta be  turned  who's doing  that  fucking  a cat  chasing a  mouse  on a  fucking  wheel  those guys  with the  big legs  from that  fucking  Lord of the  Rings  you see that  commercial 
[01:55:00]  where the guys  with the big  what's that  fucking  commercial  man  from  monster.com  of the dudes  with the big  ass  oh yeah  okay  monster.com  and they spin the earth  with their big legs  there's a guy  with big legs  riding a bike  let's say how to  Rick in Arkansas  Rick  because all that  shit runs on  oil  or like  nuclear  Rick  hey  um  I just  now I know  what Rush Limbaugh's  dreams were like  when he was on  Oxy  why  well  you know  you went from 
[01:55:30]  sucking Arab  cocks  to save your life  to  fucking  peanut butter  cars  peanut butter  cars  alright  we could be  we could be  quietly saving  the earth  by having  these kind  of conversations  from time  to time  just never know  just the peanut  butter  concepts  did you see  that show  on  where was it  discovery of  history  what will happen  to the earth  when the humans  are gone  I heard about  it  I want to see  that too  oh it was  god awful  was it  why 
[01:56:00]  it just  sounded like  it was going  to be interesting  it just means  like the trees  will start growing  again and weeds  and vines  and that's that  and then the  environment will  pretty much go  right back to  where it was  before humans  were on this  it would just  be better  basically  yeah  and it wouldn't  take that much  time actually  no  especially in  human terms  yeah  that shit  is crazy  and the only  thing I don't  believe in is  the meteor  and that's it  oh the big  meteor  gonna hit us  I just don't  think if it  hits us  it would mean  a fucking  thing  you think  that's all hype  like a big  snowstorm  and everything  else  it'll be like 
[01:56:30]  oh my god  and then it'll  hit and kind  of fuck some  shit up  but then it'll  be like  ah we're okay  if a rock  as big as  Manhattan  hits the earth  comes from  space  as big as  Manhattan  hits Manhattan  Manhattan  will be fucked  up  right  there'll be  an evil  tidal wave  somewhere  if it hits  the ocean  but the whole  world  and we go  into  you don't  think a bunch  of dust  will go into  the atmosphere  close out  the sun  and then  fucks  no  you know why  the dinosaurs  died  why  the meteor  hit the earth  AIDS  shook a lot 
[01:57:00]  of things  and all the  food  like got  knocked over  and then it  rotted  and then the  dinosaurs  couldn't eat  anymore  and they  starved to  death  because dinosaurs  didn't have  we would adapt  to a meteor  hitting the earth  we would  yes  dinosaurs  didn't have  doctors  right  and all that  bullshit  they died  of fucking  rectal cancer  like everybody  else  you know  something  they did  they had a  pretty good  run  yeah  because they  lasted a  fuck of a lot  longer than  we've been  here  that's for  sure  a few people 
[01:57:30]  checking in  what if your  car ran on  garlic butter  saw  garlic butters  yeah  well they have  the cars that  run  it's sort of  a modified  diesel engine  and it could  run on  Willie Nelson's  into that  yeah it runs  on like french fry  oil that they  dump in the back  of mcdonald's  and shit  and you  pour it in  there  and it runs  it's a diesel  motor  come on man  we got  we can  which french fries 
[01:58:00]  can you eat  though  come on really  we can do  better  yeah  yeah yeah  a little bit  i think  oh by the way  yes  the corn thing  the corn oil  thing is kind  of a bust  rich in steno  has reminded me  there is a  satellite that's  going to hit  the earth  it's out of  control  it's going to  hit somewhere  and i'd like  to dream that  like it's going  to just hit some  dope walking  down the sidewalk  in a city  somewhere  but they're  going to  have it  all figured  out  so don't  you worry  they're going  to know  exactly  where that  fucking  thing is  falling  they say  this one's  pretty out  of control  what are they  worried about 
[01:58:30]  they'll know  in time  they'll have  some notice  they'll know  within  they'll know  pretty  accurately  where it's  going to  hit  but what if  it's like  it's going  to hit  Manhattan  there's nothing  they can  really do  about it  and just say  it's just  going to  hit Manhattan  take your  vacation time  I remember  being a kid  do you think  they'll find  something to do  shoot it out  of the sky  it's the size  of a bus  they'll do  a James Bond  thing  what was the 
[01:59:00]  satellite that  fell when we  were growing up  Skylab  Skylab  right  I remember  being a caddy  just convinced  that it was  going to hit  me on the head  while I was  caddy  in Australia  well it ended  up in Australia  but I think  if I remember  correctly  they didn't  know back  then  they didn't  have as  much  shit  they knew  at the last  minute  where it  was going  to come  down  remember how  paranoid  you felt  like you  kept looking  up at the  sky  how big  is this  thing  this thing  is about  the size  of a bus  city bus  it's a spy 
[01:59:30]  satellite  so they don't  know what's  in there  all of its  engines are  dead  so it's  just kind  of  its orbit  is decaying  and then it'll  just come  through the  atmosphere  and crash  somewhere  a little  of it'll  burn up  the listener  requests  voicemail  next message  hey this is  bill from  Tampa  the bid I'm  requesting is a  Larry King  medley  no one but the  boys and little  Jimmy go after  that worthless  old fuck 
[02:00:00]  making seven  million a year  it's incredible  that they still  pay him  that old fuck  deserves it  message deleted  I learned a  little  during the  commercial  I was trying  out the  internets  trying to  learn a little  about computers  and what did  you learn  from the  internets  well I  learned  a video  called  meat spin  that's a

[02:26:00]  want to  go out  or she  she asked  me to  many times  to come  over to  go over  and hang  out at  the pool  with her  and then  at those  times i  didn't want  to go  out  of  i  think  paula  abdul  china  and  mccull  smith  all have  the same  drug deal  the same  drugs  they sound  all the same  reports coming in  in her hotel room  found on the night  table  garlic and welch's  grape juice  is this news  can you od on  garlic  this isn't a

[02:27:00]  was at daniel's  funeral i  asked her  why isn't there  any family  members  what about  your friends  and i  remember uh  china being on  your show  when daniel  just died  and as far  as i'm  concerned  taking some  low shots  about right  away she  went to  all these  allegations  like she  knew  all this  stuff about  anna  but yet  when i  talked to  anna  she said  that she  kind of  was like  a stalker  and she  would call  her and  anna didn't  want to  return her  calls  um so  for someone  to make  claims like  they know  something about  someone when  they haven't  even spoken  to them  for a while 
[02:27:30]  why is this  about why  is this  about  because  she's  for credentials  that's all  but we'll  get off that  now we want  to go back  to uh  to anna  nicole  exactly  want to go  back to my  next question  uh  talkies  do you think  they'll catch  on  why is this  about the  fact that i  don't really  know her  and i'm on tv  talking about  it  i mean what  do you think  about it  i was just  a friend  i said at

[02:50:00]  listen to this  Listen, I came up with an idea  And it's honestly the biggest idea  I've ever come up with  I want at least 50% because it's my idea  It's all yours  No, I'm not kidding, it's going to make you guys billionaires  It will make you billionaires  So far on this trip, I've lost two purses  I lose my bag every day  Where's my purse?  They have it  I have no idea where my purse is  I want to make a line of bags, of purses  That has a chip in it  Tracking device  Lojack for bags 
[02:50:30]  I love it  Even hire operators  That you call up like  Like Armstrong  You know what I mean?  My purse just got stolen, where is it?  It's on 5th Street and 42nd  We're getting it now  We even have people in their cars that get the bags  Let's be realistic  You mentioned the people putting a Lojack in a purse  It sounds stupid  Every person that has money is going to do that  Everyone  Who thought of that? Genius girl  I am the smartest girl  You all think I'm just a party girl  But I'm also a smart girl, I'm a smart business woman 
[02:51:00]  Oh, that will make billions?  Wow  It's a purse with a chip in it  And you track it  And there's people that just drive around cities  Waiting to pick up your purse  We can use the Air Force  Just everything  A radar station  And fly my purse  They got that chip technology ready  And I'm sure people are using it  It's on keychains  You go, beep, beep  Like the New York City Marathon happened  And if you had a loved one in the race  You could just follow their progress 
[02:51:30]  Track them  Yeah, on the internet  Like, oh wow  They're still in Brooklyn  Or, oh wow  They're crossing the bridge now  So they've got the  What the fuck are they doing?  They've got the technology  So there's basically a satellite beam  I mean, what kind of stress is that on your body?  You're running 26 miles  And you've got this fucking beam coming down from outer space  Right into the top of your head  We're being cut through every nanosecond of our lives  By radiation from radio, TV, satellite  All that stuff is just blowing through you  Small little particles, electrons flying through you 
[02:52:00]  Nice  If you could see those  If they were visible  We wouldn't be able to see each other  The air is so just full of noise  Can you say all that in tar?  That sounds like a tar  Imagine radio waves  Imagine if you will  Just sitting there  And if radio waves like had color to them  Instead of just being like clear  And like clear nail polish  If they were like red  It would be like nothing but red in front of you  And we couldn't watch paradise  It would be an awful thing  That would be like crazy 
[02:52:30]  Like right now I'm inhaling them  With every drag I take on my cigarette  I'm breathing in like radio  Radio waves  And I think that's really what's hurting people  Not the cigarettes  So I got on my knees  Suck cock at a party  I wouldn't be able to see it  Because all the radio waves  Oh my god  I'm searching for that dick  Through all the radio waves  There's a stiff cock in the room  And I can't find it  Because of radio waves  Oh my god it's crazy  Oh my god  Guys I have an idea  I did for an invention 
[02:53:00]  It's an idea for an invention  I'm with cigarettes  Alright  I'm with cigarettes  Instead of just a filter that filters out  Like tar and nicotine  Well I'm going to filter out radio waves  So instead of breathing in like radio waves  You can see  And then you can look in the end of the filter  And when you see it's brown  Like from the tar and nicotine  You can also like  Put it in your ear  And listen to the radio waves  That would have gone in your lungs  And then I can still see the cock  And I guess not it  Yeah  It was like  As you're puffing  You're clearing a little space  Just in case the radio waves  Get colorful  And we can't see anymore  You clear a hole  Like a little glory hole 
[02:53:30]  For the cock to come through the radio  To my head  Yeah  We'll patent it  I want 50%  And make a billion dollars  So you think  I'm just a part of you  I'm really smart  I'm a genius  Moving on  Here she describes her friends  I love seeing my friends  I love my friends so much  I really have  I gotta tell you  The best people  And the best friends around me  They're all just nice people  Every one of them are  They always have a good time  They love to play  You know  They're perfect for me  Yeah 
[02:54:00]  Let's see if those friends are with you  After your career  Really  Was there like an ounce of sincerity  In any of that  There was no passion at all  In her talk about her friend  She was talking about  Employees  And like  You know  Producers from the show  People that will be gone  And she'll never see again  When the show is cancelled  She's talking about the people  Who roll their eyes  The second she fucking walks away  Right  My good friends  They are such good friends  Of mine  And I call them friends  Because  They're indeed 
[02:54:30]  Friends  The upstairs  Is half a square  That looks over  The dance floor  In that half a square  There's an VIP area  So we had half of the whole side  Of the upstairs  That looked over the dance floor  I loved dancing on the pole  It was fantastic  Everyone thought I was going to fall off the pole  Of course  But I loved just swirling around on it  It was like in the middle of this wall  Like this dancing pole  It was the best place in the second time  We had the time of our lives  She cannot describe anything  I couldn't paint a mental picture of that  It came out like a Picasso 
[02:55:00]  And there's like this thing on the floor  And a wall  And the VIP is half of it  And there's a pole  And I was dancing  And people thought I'd fall off  But I didn't  And it was  And there was a teeter-totter  And a big sphere  And a thing  And it launched  And I went  And you know what the funny thing is  You know like three feet over  Like the Mona Lisa is hanging there  And she totally doesn't even see it  It's like she's seen all this amazing shit  And she's just like  Where's the pie?  They're having Applebee's in Rome  I don't want to get some potato skin 
[02:55:30]  I don't want to say  I suck to cock and Applebee's  Maybe it was a Ruby Tuesday  They kind of have the same appetizers  I think it was right next to  The Louvre  The Louvre  I had Louvre's on the back of my car window once  And they kept the sun from coming in  And stuff  And there's this whole big building  In Paris that just sells them  It's called the Louvre  And it's not much bigger than Home Depot 
[02:56:00]  It's like crazy  And all my friends are there  And I love them  I love you guys  You guys are awesome  You're my friends  We're all friends  Right guys?  Friends  All my friends are such close  Tight-knit friends  Sure they are  Well that was the end of  This is Sarah  She's my best friend  And my wardrobe's Sarah  I love her  Isn't she great?

[02:56:30]  The Paris UK one was the best though  Yeah  Yes  What was that ones we listened to?  No we just listened to St. Tropez  Oh I want to hear some  The Paris UK  And how she talks about  Like the Eurotunnel  And all that  Unbelievable  It starts with the Eiffel Tower  And I guess she's talking about  Getting engaged under the Eiffel Tower  If you get engaged under the Eiffel Tower  Your marriage lasts forever  Really?  Yeah  It's an old urban legend 
[02:57:00]  But  Why not?  I should make a sign  Will you marry me?  Will you marry me?  Yeah you got a yes  You got a yes  Tara  You got a get down on one knee?

Tara Reid  May I have your hand in marriage?  Yes  Our love is forever 
[02:57:30]  This guy  Mike from Ohio  A tourist right there  Asked me to marry him  And I said yes  And I was like  I love this other word  And I was good  I don't even know who you are  But I love Van Weylen  Oh thanks  I just married Tara Reid  Forever  You can't be at the tower  And you're engaged  Yeah  No  I don't even know  Now I'm going to ruin my love forever  Wow 
[02:58:00]  That is just jaw-droppingly horrific  How could you take that off?  It's great  I can't believe it  He has me  This guy Mike  From Ohio  He has me to marry him  Underneath the Eiffel Tower  And we're going to get married  Underneath there  When they finally finish the thing  And put like  The paneling on it  It's not done yet  Because it's there  It's just all beams  I wish a rioting Muslim  Would punch her square  In her fucking face  How funny it would be  If they lit her car on fire  With her in it  Oh my god you guys 
[02:58:30]  The Muslims are burning me  Here in Paris  This party is the hottest party ever  I can't believe you shot her  That was my best friend  Or was her name  Was that Talitha  Oh Melissa  I can't remember her name  But she was such a dear  Close friend of mine  And I lost my purse  In the middle of the rioting  They lit it on fire  But I had a chip in it  They should put chips  In like potato chips  And anytime you want  Potato chips  You just hit the chips  And you can find  The nearest vending machine 
[02:59:00]  It's how I read  It's chipping a chip  It's going to be  A beautiful wonderful invention  It's going to make billions of dollars  And the chips  Attaches the chips  And that's what you hold to  So you don't get  That gerido stuff  On your finger  And it comes up  On the navigation system  On your escalator  And it'll come up like  You know barbecue  Or ranch  Or you know  Onion  A garlic  Potato chip  It'll tell you  What type of potato chip  You're going to eat  Here we go  All my friends  It gets better  She's looking for submarines  In this next clip  While looking for submarines  Let's go on this gorgeous boat  And see the most beautiful sights of Paris

Is that a submarine  I mean a glass water boat 
[03:00:00]  Whatever  Wow  Is that a battleship  A dinghy  Whatever  A sailboat  Or what  A truck  If I was ever married to her  I would have to choke her out  Every time she fucking woke up  The second she said  Hey  Just  Go back to sleep  Crazy  Just watch her eyes shut  And then let off  Let her breathe  But she's unconscious  And every time she comes to  Just choke her out  Yeah just keep choking her out  God damn it that'd be great 
[03:00:30]  Alright  I'll be your tour guide today  My name is Tara Reid  We're in Paris  And that is the Louvre  That is the Louvre  There is so much art in the Louvre  That they had to  Blow it over the bridge  To this place  So they kept it  Very close  Once every eight years  The Mona Lisa leaves that place  Goes over that bridge  They bring it right through that door  And goes right through that window  Every eight years  And they say  Every eight years  On Halloween night 
[03:01:00]  She blinks her eyes  Can you imagine?  That is the Paris  Arlene  In front of us  That was the Musée d'Anse  The Musée d'Anse  That's another name they call it  It was an old bus station  This is the same  Somebody said  Now it's another museum, right?  You guys, that's the oldest brothel in Paris  Right there  I'm going to work there later tonight  American history  That is the sex of the city bridge  Where Carrie runs away  And Mr. Big finds her  Mr. Big and Carrie 
[03:01:30]  That's a major American moment  Right there, that bridge  She was wearing her Manola Plonic shoes  Everyone remember her Manola Plonic shoes  And they fell madly in love  Like me today  I'm now engaged  To Mike from Ohio  I don't want her alive  I really  How did Carson Daly date her?  Wow  I met that guy a couple times 
[03:02:00]  A cool guy  I guess you just gotta keep your dick in her mouth  That's probably the only way to survive the relationship  Oh my god  Oh my god  I was out the other night  Just keep  Keep it full  That couldn't be  Imagine you're just some poor motherfucker on a tour  And Tara Reade decides her and her camera crew are coming on  And she's the one giving the tour  Yeah, you've been waiting your whole life to go to Paris 
[03:02:30]  Oh, I wonder what that building is  Oh my god  It's part of the Louvre  And every eight years  The Mona Lisa  It goes  And that's the episode of the Sex and the City  Sex and the City  Wearing the Manola Plonic shoes  And it's  Why?  Who cares?  Ugh  And the submarine  Paris is always so crowded  Sorry  It's okay  I was just talking about the submarine  Or, you know  The septic tank  Whatever  Paris is always so crowded  And so packed  So to have it by ourselves  And, you know  To see Paris  I mean, we did all these like fun  Like silly little like tour things 
[03:03:00]  We walked through the park  And it was beautiful  There was like a carousel  Then we got up  And we went up  Like and walked down the corner  And went to this area  And we saw all these great paintings  And artists  And people drawing  It's  It's  It's the mentality of  Asking like a third grader  Not even  What did you do on your summer vacation?  She should come home with like  Yeah, kindergarten  Like a picture she drew with crayon  You know  When they just have like the lines  Just  It's just a scribble 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  Or when they say draw you  And it's just two big eyes  And arms  That don't fit  They go to color in your shirt  And half it goes over your face  Goes over the lines  And the face  And  Stupid kids  Here she complains about it  I put some glitter  On my macaroni  I made an ashtray  With macaroni  And gold paint  And some glitter  I did it all by myself  I did it all by myself  It's an ashtray  And  As I was making it 
[03:04:00]  I filled it up  Here she complains  That her drink  Is  Too weak  Of course it is  First round's on me kids  Anything from martinis  Champagne  Whiskies  Cocktails  Liquors  Beers  And  Anything else you want  What do you guys want?  I don't know  Yeah, the cocktails on the back  Um  Can I just have an avion?  No, what do you want, sweetie?  Large bottle of water  One, two, three  Four 
[03:04:30]  What do you want, Dom?  Four  Four large bottles of water  Can I get a peach iced tea?  With vodka in it?  Spice it up a little  Cheers  They didn't put any  They measured the stuff here  It's not even like an American shot  It's like this big  Did you see it?  It was like up to here  With ice in it  So it doesn't even taste like anything  I'm bitching  There isn't enough vodka in it  Can you imagine  If she was your girl  And you actually took her to Paris  And these are the comments you were making 
[03:05:00]  You'd be like  I should have taken this cunt to Rhode Island  She's not getting there  I should have taken her to Six Flags  Hang on  It was a carousel  And we went on a roller coaster  We should have went  And looked at leaves  You know  We went on a submarine glass bottom boat  And we saw like  We were walking  And there's people drawing  Yeah great  We went to Athens  And we got some beers  And it was crazy  They were so weak  The drinks and stuff  Oh yeah  There were some old wrecked buildings  That we drove through 
[03:05:30]  I was like  What are you taking me to?  The ghetto?  It was amazing  We had it all to ourselves  The same way  Every other place I got to  Is all to myself  So it wasn't that amazing  We went to Greece  And there's this building  Called the Parthenon  And it's just such a wreck  Why don't they clean it up?  Fix it already  Fix  It's a real fixer upper  But for some reason  They won't build on it  Excuse me  The statue's missing the arms  Poor woman 
[03:06:00]  She's got like no arms  And I think it's a statue  Like to show that  Handicapped people  Can do things too  If it was an American museum  They'd have the arms on it  It'd be like totally  Like complete  That's why we got to  Feel lucky to be Americans  You guys  We have like whole statues  Like statue of liberty  Our hat  I mean she wouldn't even  Be holding the thing up  If it was in Greece  Imagine if it just had one arm  Gee  Where's my drink? 
[03:06:30]  Drunk whore  Fucking tolerance is ridiculous  She's like  She's in the same  Fucking watering holes  As fucking Ernest Hemingway  She's like  Oh my god  It's fucking weak  You guys  I hate  They're so mean  It's whiskey and iced tea  I mean come on  I hate  They're so mean  They're mean evil  Oh my god  Look how bad my hair was  Looks like strings  She's talking about  The tabloids here 
[03:07:00]  Looking at pictures of herself  And the tabloids  Why are they so evil?  They're just mean people  They're bad  They're just mean  You know what I wish  I could do?  I wish I could find  The editors  Inquire of all these people  And all the mean things  They do to us  I wish we could have  Someone follow them  Around like a detective  And take bad pictures of them  And put them in paper  And they would see what it feels like  And they'd be quicker to just try to ruin people's lives  Yeah that's what would happen 
[03:07:30]  Yeah but she had all of the tabloids in front of her  Yeah she  She couldn't get enough of the tabloids  And she was going through the tabloids  I saw this  And she was looking for her picture  Yeah she loves when she's in those  Because these celebrities love when their picture is in these rags  Yeah  Without a doubt  Wow  Moving on  We're almost done here  Discussing the Euro Tunnel  My producer just told me  That I have to tell you guys  A really interesting fact  We are going 187 miles right now  On the Euro Store  Underneath the English Channel 
[03:08:00]  So I just want you all to know  That that's why the walls are black  We're in a tunnel  Going almost 200 miles an hour  On our way back to London  The tunnel's called  The Bula Tunnel  I'm kidding  What's the name of the tunnel?

[03:09:00]  Is called the Euro Tunnel  Why is that?  It doesn't have France or England in it  It should be the Franklin Tunnel  Something like that  She thinks it was a play on your tunnel  Your Tunnel  This is your tunnel  It's everybody's tunnel  It's your tunnel  How boring  It's called your tunnel  What a complete  Doot  We're going like 700 miles an hour  Like no concept of speed  Or anything  You're just a fucking  And she gets to go to all these places  I'm so fucking jealous

[03:17:30]  I mean  You pretty much  Changed Howard's show  It took on a  A whole nother  Direction  Yeah  You were a talent  On there  That brought it up  To another level  Well I was facilitated  In different ways  You know  Like uh  They  They'd get me going  On a certain premise  Or they'd say  Hey  Try this tomorrow  Or  And then you know  Of course Jackie  Was the million dollar man  I mean he used to  You know  He'd hand me something  That was like worth a million dollars 
[03:18:00]  In comedy dollars  Yeah  It was uh  That  That was like the golden age  Of Stern's show  Uh  With Jackie  And you there  Some of the  Some of the stuff  I  You know  It's like  I haven't listened  In an awful long time  Um  I'm a big fan  Of like AM radio  Right  And I listen to uh  You know  The liberal talk shows  That are starting to flourish  In the face of all that  Other right wing crap  You know  Yeah  Yeah  Both sides can be  Pretty entertaining though  When they  They really go off  Yeah 
[03:18:30]  But there's um  There's this thing  That you know  Over the years  Everybody was trying to  You know  Conjure up  Like what must have  Happened over there  When I left  And I used to  Read the post  And I used to go  I don't remember this  Asshole being in the room  When I said these things  And did them  Really  You know  And everybody's an expert  This is what happened  Yeah yeah  There's a lot of  Billy went in there one day  And he's ungrateful  And you know  Yeah there was a lot of  Controversy as to why you left  Because uh  You definitely were  A shining star on that show 
[03:19:00]  I  Some of the  The most memorable things  That came out of Howard's show  Was uh  Billy West  The  The March shot  The March shot  I used to listen  Every morning  When I was working  And uh  Uh  When I was actually working  For a living  In construction  And the March shot thing  The fucking Woodstock  Thing was uh  Probably one of the funniest things  That was ever done  Allison Steele  Doing the voiceover  Yeah  Allison Steele  God  And uh  You doing Larry Fine  Well Larry  Was the basis 
[03:19:30]  For uh  Stimpy's voice  Yeah  Stimpy  But  And no one did  Larry fucking  Yeah  No one did Larry Fine  It was  And it was a dead on Larry Fine  And it's like  God damn  I thought they were  So sublime  You know what I mean  Yeah  It's like uh  And then putting them  Totally out of context  Into Woodstock  Was  That bit was fantastic  Everything out of context  With the Stooges  Is funny  Yeah  You know what I mean  It's like  Hey Mo  I broke your Pesach dishes  Oh I think nothing of it kid 
[03:20:00]  Why are you imbecile  This is the meat  And this is the dairy  Ow  Ow  Hey you missed one  No I didn't  God damn  Wait a minute  Is that Yiddish  For go take a shit  In the ocean  Oh a wandering Jew  Eh  Well get wandering  You must have just  Grown up  Sitting in front  Of the television  Oh yeah  Forever  But you know what  I was right  My mother thought  That they were idiots  Yeah  Stooges  She said how can you 
[03:20:30]  Watch those awful men  And look  I thought Mo  Was a genius  But I didn't know why  And then believe it or not  He and Albert Einstein  Had a lot  And had something in common  I know you won't believe this  But it's true  Mo actually explained  E equals MC squared  The theory  What do you call  Theory of relativity  Yeah  When he said  We ain't getting  No place fast  And I said  Oh my god  It's true  He has a link  To Albert Einstein  Except Mo  Said it where  I could understand it 
[03:21:00]  You know  Did you grow up  On that though  Watching a lot  Of cartoons  Mel Blanc  Oh sure  Sure  I watched it all  And wondered  How the hell  Can someone do this  Because he wasn't  Just a collection  Of witty little voices  That guy was  The best damn actor  Yeah  You know  And I know  I think  Anthony  Does voices right  Yeah  Anthony does amazing voices  It's just you know  Watching  It's a lifetime  Of watching a lot  Of television  And being a minor bird  Yeah create your own 
[03:21:30]  Characters though  Because Impressionist  It is my feeling on it  It's like you know  We all wanted to be  Like Rich Little  Or Frank Gorshin  Or the other guy  There David Fry  Yeah  And one day  We woke up  In an America  That didn't give a fuck  About Impressionists  Yeah true  You know what I mean  So as soon as I started  Doing like original characters  All of a sudden  It was like  Wow  Look at that  You know  And I felt like  None of my things  That I could ever come up with  Could measure up to  What Mel Blanc did  And that  But that's not the point 
[03:22:00]  You've got to be  You can't be the next  You can't be the next Mel Blanc  By doing Mel Blanc's voices  No  You've got to be like  The best you  Yeah that was amazing  He came up with all of them  And so many of them  You know  And they were so different  It wasn't like  Oh you could tell  This is the same guy  Doing this voice  Or that voice  Well he inspired me  To try to be as diverse  As possible  You know like  Gosh like on Futurama  Yeah  Try to split it up  You know  They'd be like  Zap Brannigan  You know  This is Zap Brannigan  Master of time and space 
[03:22:30]  And everything in between  And oh yeah  Winner of this year's  Modesty Award  Yeah  Yeah  He was based on  All the big dumb announcers  I came up with  Who loved far and away  Above everything else  The sound of their own voice  Yeah  They keep their balls  In the wheelbarrow  Wow  You know  It's like trying to make  Eight syllable words  Out of one  Yeah  Coming to the Worcester Centrum  Meh  Back to the Howard thing though  What actually did happen 
[03:23:00]  Because you guys were  Just riding a rocket ship  And then to have  What I see  I don't know how modest you are  But what I see  Was a huge part of that show  Just disappear from it  I wasn't really aware of that  Until years later  I started reading posts  You know  And it was like  Hey  I'm saying  It's almost ten years  And people are still  Going back and forth  About this  Like what the heck  And you know  I mean  I've always said  That I thought 
[03:23:30]  Howard was the greatest  And I never blamed him  For my problems  With management at K-Rock  When I wanted a raise  You know  Right  I mean  They just stopped  Returning my solicitor's  Phone call  So I said  How could they not  Give you a raise  I don't know  Look  You know  I mean  This business is filled  With guys that are  Doing radio  That just stink  And then  They don't get it  Every once in a while  There's a talent  That comes along  Like a Billy West  You gotta  Take care of them  Well I mean  They used to have  These guys propped up there  Like Scott and Todd  And this  Franny and Zooey  And Ricky and Zicky 
[03:24:00]  And you know  And I say  These guys got that  Certain nothing  Don't they  No shit  And I'm going  How good do you have  The frickin' B  You know  To get the money  And it's like  Not everybody  Wants to live in a sewer  Right  I'm not calling New York  A sewer  But you gotta have money  To live there  And stay away  From the sewer  And it's ridiculous there  And they just stopped  Returning my lawyer's  Phone calls  So I said to myself  Hey you know  What I'm not a victim  I just went into Howard  To say I'm leaving  And that I respected him 
[03:24:30]  And I loved him  And I thanked him  For the time there  And you know  For the first time  In 12 years  I didn't know  Where I was going  Because I worked in Boston  Yeah  I'm not trying to make  Any battle here  Or anything  But did he go  To bat for you  I mean that's  See I have no idea  But I never expected  Anything from anybody  I just said  Yeah I know  You don't expect  Anything but  Jesus Christ  He was a clear sign  That said  You know  Well you're not  That valuable  So I didn't blame  Anybody or get mad  Or bitter  I just said 
[03:25:00]  Well the chance  Of making real big money  Here will never happen  If I can't  That's just amazing  Well as far as  The money goes  I'm sure you showed them  But you know  I mean  You know what it is  I'm like the nicest guy  I'm the most like  You know  Like I don't know  What do you call it  Sort of reticent guy  When it comes to  Asking for money  And I realize  You gotta be like  Fucking pony soprano  Or something nowadays  God damn  I used to be the same  Fucking way  No shit  I was just  There's a time 
[03:25:30]  You go through  There's a time  You go through  Where you're just  Kind of happy  To be there  Yeah I know 
[03:26:00]  And the money thing  Definitely  Is not even an issue  But then when you realize  You know  Your car is falling apart  And you gotta make  Your bills  You kinda wanna  At least be compensated  For what you're doing  And the capacity  That you're doing  Can I tell you  This Billy West  Is a very inspirational  Phone call  I hope you all realize that  Absolutely  Absolutely Jimmy  This is coming soon  No no  I guess I'm here  To teach lessons  And whatever  Yeah  You know  For aspiring radio people  Is you know  Just like 
[03:26:30]  Eat the shit sandwich  For a while  But don't  Don't leave that  As your precedent  You know  You're not gonna say it  But it's pretty obvious  That someone's ego  Got in the way  And it's too bad  Because  I really don't know  All I know  Because you were doing  Some great great things  And we're in radio  Like if someone like you  Came along  Holy shit  We'd make sure  You were taken care of  Are you kidding me  There were guys  Sidekicks  That just did so much better  Than I did  But I didn't think of myself  As a sidekick  I just thought of myself  As a utility infielder  But I was 
[03:27:00]  But I was good at it  And you know  This weird soap opera  Kicked off  About two months ago  When some shit fuck  Took a quote of mine  Off my website  And injected  His own editorial  What was that quote  What was the quote  I was bitter about Stern  And then he lobbed it  Into the New York Post  As if he had talked to me  And he put that  I was bitter in there  And it went to Richard Johnson  And because of one scavenger  I wound up looking like  A bag of dumb remarks  Yeah that same asshole  Has printed a lot of bullshit 
[03:27:30]  But I mean  How can you get away with that  Like taking something  That you read somewhere  And saying that  They told it to you  And that he sounded  This or that  You're talking about  Tracy Hayden  Who just makes shit up  Yeah  I'm a decent guy  You know  I gave everything my all  Yeah  Millions of people happy  For over a decade  And still no matter  What the fuck you do  There'll always be like  Thirteen and a half people  Who hate you  For some reason  Billy like I said  That was the golden age  Of that show  And uh  Well I don't know  That was the  You can't miss a day  Because you guys 
[03:28:00]  Had something there  And it was amazing  I listened to the old tapes  And I'm like going  Oh my god  I don't even remember  Saying that  Yeah  All I knew  Is that I  Come out of there  Just kind of like  Questioning myself  Like what the fuck  Did you just say  You know  Yeah  Sometimes you listen  Most people got it  People are smart  They got it  Yeah  Would you ever go back  To radio  No I think  For guys like you  You know  You're probably an anomaly  You probably get a lot of money  Because you hung in there 
[03:28:30]  And you  You know  You made it  You know  But radio  We're one of the lucky shows  They're not going to bring  A lot of radio shows  To satellite so  We're lucky  Not high profile anyway  Besides you know  Howard I mean  I want a show  You want a show  That's right  We got Saturday night  Here for you  Oh yeah  It's at 12 midnight  We should talk  Yeah I know  We could give you some time  No problem  I'd have a fun time you know  The great thing is  You disappeared off of Howard's show  But then you just popped up  Everywhere doing voiceover work  Well actually I guess 
[03:29:00]  In this weird  Zen way  I have them to thank  For just you know  Refusing to  Pay you  Up the ante  Because you know  I really  I went to nothing  I left and went to nothing  That's against all  What your uncles told you  You know  Right  We stupid  Have something to back it up  Before you leave  You asshole  Make sure you got something  Lined up  Yep  You know  And then I have that work ethic  Because it was installed in me  You know  Because the immigrant mentality  You know  Yeah  You had a chance to work  18 hours a day  And you didn't do it  The fuck is wrong with you 
[03:29:30]  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  You start hearing  The Honey Nut Cheerio B  And I'm like  I think that's Billy West  Oh yeah  And then it just  Honey Nut Cheerios  It's irresistible  There you go  I'm a recycler  I believe in recycling  You know  Because I'm big on that  With garbage and stuff  Yeah  But I used  I used that voice  On that show  Doug  Right  That was Nickelodeon Doug  And Doug was a painfully shy  11 and a half year old 
[03:30:00]  And this is my dog  Porkchop  And  This is the cash rolls in  Hey  This is Roger Quartz  And I'm telling him  The coolest guy on radio  And I got to roll your radio too  What do you think about that?  This is the same voice  And the cash rolls in  Yeah  That's great  Well you know what  I got to tell you  Radio is like kind of  You're a buyout basically  I know I always was  Because you don't  Really own anything  You know that you did 
[03:30:30]  And you can't get residuals on it  So it's kind of a license  To print money  And  I think  I was one of these guys  That just said  Wow you know  Residuals is what keeps  People alive out here  Yep  You know you don't hear  From Terry Hatcher  For years  And all of a sudden  You know  Bang  But she had to live somehow  And she got all those  Superman residuals  Oh I do a Terry Hatcher impression  Oh yeah  Yeah  Do these bones  Make me look fat? 
[03:31:00]  You know  I just  I don't know  I love  The residual thing  And I explained it  To my mom's boyfriend  He's an ex-firefighter  Retired firefighter  In Boston  And  One day I came over there  And he said  I want to know about show business  He wants to know about  Everything about show business  He thinks I'm like  The president of show business  Show business  Yeah  I'm as close as anybody  Will ever get in that block  But  He would say  You know what  I've got to ask you Bill 
[03:31:30]  What do you think  Is the best part of your job?  Is it the people you work with?  Is it the hours?  You know  What is the best part of your job?  And I said  Well Walter  Imagine  You got in your robe  And your slippers  And you got on the mailbox  And  You know  And if there's a check  For a fire you fought in 1973  Yeah  And he just looked at me  He goes  Gotcha  I mean it's still out  It's still out  He didn't come back  He did a really good job  He should be getting residual 
[03:32:00]  For it  That's a great way to put it  Do you get really really small  Paychecks in there as well  Like  For like  Two dollars and fifty cents  Some dumb  Little obscure thing you did  Yeah  It's not like  Savings bonds  You know  The more time goes on  The less they  You know  Are valued  Yeah  Like the residuals  Just kind of  Wear down to nothing  But that's okay  Because  I mean  I get a work ethic  I go out every single day  And if I'm not doing a gig  I'll be auditioning  Because if you want to work  You've got to audition 
[03:32:30]  What's the latest thing  You've done  Or that is coming out  I recorded a pilot  For television  For George of the Jungle  Kind of a different take on it  I've done a million pilots  See they don't make  Cartoon shows anymore  They just  Make a whole mess of pilots  And if one of them  Or two of them  Has emotional resonance  Then they'll  Make a show out of it  Really  Yeah  It's a whole part of this  Trying to ensure success  Thing that they  They don't have  Quite down out here  In stupid wood 
[03:33:00]  So you're also  Well Futurama  Is that still going?  Yes  Every place in the world  If you don't mind me telling you  I got all this cool meat  Hanging off my face  Don't wait  Get me a sandwich  From the dumpster  And leave my maggots on it  And I did  Professor Farnsworth  Yeah  Oh good news everyone  Bad news 
[03:33:30]  That show  That's fantastic man  I think there was one more in there  But I can't remember  That was my favorite show  Yeah  You gotta do bugs  Before you leave man  Well let's see  What did I get from Warner Brothers  For doing that picture?  Oh I got a million  And I got it out of them  One carrot at a time doc  That must have been something though  All of a sudden  You're the voice of Bugs Bunny 
[03:34:00]  And Warner Brothers characters  Yeah it was great when every  Idiot that walked down the hallway  Pops their head in the door  While you're doing it  And go  Alright he's too  He's too much of a wise guy  And then  Another person will swing by  20 minutes later  And pop their head in the door  And he goes  He's too Jewish  Oh shit  And then another idiot  Would come in and go  Where's the tough guy?  You know?  Yeah that's gotta be rough  Because everybody  Is so familiar with that voice  But I mean  We're in radio  We came from radio  And our world 
[03:34:30]  Was a sonic world  More than visual  Yeah  Theater of the mind  These people don't think like that  They just have their own  Little perception  Of which ones they saw  I mean Bugs had a million  Incarnations  Depending on the director  Right  Which is  They're putting that out too  Warner Brothers home video  Oh really?  Triple threat of classic animation  Yeah it's the Looney Tunes  Golden collection  And I did some commentary on it  And it's got  Like all the best stuff on it  And beautiful  Pristine  You know cause  It's so funny 
[03:35:00]  We think that the  Warner Brothers cartoons  Are playing constantly  Like when we were kids  Yeah  But they're not  And I think there's a whole  Mess of kids  That are like  Six and up now  That don't really know  Who they are  Yeah not a clue  No  And you know what  Cartoons were better  Then I mean  It never occurred to me  To burn down my own house  No I know  When I was seven  Yeah for some reason  They decided that  Some character  Some animated animal  Hitting another one  With a frying pan  Was going to get kids  To do that  So they had to 
[03:35:30]  Stop doing it  Oh man it got so bad  It got so bad  In the 70's  That there was this woman  Peggy Cher in action  For children's television  Yes  And she had scenes  Deleted from Josie  And the Pussycat  Because one of the girls  Threw her cat in a bowl  Of spaghetti  And it was deemed  Very aggressive  And very needless  So they cut out the scene  Because they thought  Kids would throw their cat  In a bowl of spaghetti  I remember watching  Edited Wabbit Season  Duck Season  Where they wouldn't show  Elmer shooting Daffy  In the face  With the gun  They cut to some 
[03:36:00]  Freeze frame of bugs  Looking out of his hole  And then would cut back  To Daffy with his bill  On his head  It's like  What the fuck  Oh wow  I remember that  Yeah  Yeah  You know  That's the worst thing  You can do  I mean it's not even  Like colorizing a movie  That you've got  A color and black  And white button  On your TV set  Yeah let's take the joke  Right out of the cartoon  At that point  Watch these  Politically correct  Surgeries of that  Yeah at that point  You should just not  Air it anymore  Yeah  If you're going to do  If you're going to butcher 
[03:36:30]  Like that  Don't air it  You know what it is  Research and focus groups  And all that other crap  Doesn't work  It's a formula  That was created  By the business  So that no one person  Is responsible  For the decision  To do something  Yeah  You know they can say  Hey we did our research  We did the focus groups  And it just you know  It failed  And then they invent  New words for failure  Like deferred success  Deferred success  Yeah that's the new one  I heard out of Washington  That's a great one  I love that one  I was a deferred success  For quite a while 
[03:37:00]  I used to play music  And I was kind of a bum  Really  So many years went by  Where cartoons  And animation  Just sucked  And then  And then like  And were just  Just made for the  Smallest of children  You know no more  Adults really watching it  Like we did  Growing up  I still you know  Watched Bugs Bunny  And through my  Twenties and thirties  And everything  And then  I doubt if you ever  Did anything  Like what was going on  In those things  You realize that  This is  There are real live people 
[03:37:30]  That are responsible  For the silly stuff  That's going on  And you're more  Fascinated by that  Than the idea of  How to find a new way  To torture somebody  Yeah it had nothing  To do with that  It was just entertaining  It was funny  You know when kids  Started doing stuff  After we cut the  Good stuff out of  Cartoons and we  Banished you know  Characters that  Had cigars  And all that crap  It started going  Into Sesame Street  Which I kind of loved  I thought was great  Whenever I got to see it  But I didn't  I wasn't around  In the 70's 
[03:38:00]  Watching TV  I was playing music  Yeah  So  God damn hippie  As soon as they  Started showing  This Rainbow Brite  And My Little Pony  Oh it was all that crap  And Hammer Man  And all that other shit  Yeah  And you know what happened  It's like that generation  Wound up to do  Drive by shootings  Yeah  And killing their own kids  I mean this phenomenon  Swept the country  And I'm going  Yeah because you gotta  Get your rocks off  On something that's  Just out of your mind  Crazy on television  Because then out of nowhere  Came like Beavis and Butthead 
[03:38:30]  And Ren and Stimpy  And all of a sudden  Adults could watch  Cartoons again  And laugh their asses off  Well you know what I liked  So much about that time  Is that  Ren and Stimpy  In no way  Felt like the Simpsons  Or looked like it  And Beavis and Butthead  In no way  Took any dynamic  From Ren and Stimpy  Or the Simpsons  No  And it was  Really beautiful  Stand alone  Cartoon  It had a 50's  Look to it almost  Yeah kind of  Beatnik-y  Yeah yeah  Ren and Stimpy 
[03:39:00]  Well I remember  Beatniks because  I'm 54 years old  And it just had a  Great look and feel  To it  And the shock value  Out of a cartoon  Was every episode  Was amazing like that  A lot of fun to watch  Yeah  You know there's  More stuff coming  But I think  Computer is going  To be the place to go  And I think  Well satellite radio  Is like the wild west  Ain't it  For you guys  Yeah  So fucking lootly  Every day we're  Trying to figure this thing out  There's no law here  That's right  Yeah  You know what it is 
[03:39:30]  You guys  I know you bounced around  And you did the drill  And everything  But there's  Like I talk to a lot  Of these young  Young disc jockeys  You know that are like  Their voices crack  When they're talking  Yeah  You know  This is booger  With you  You know  And I talk to these guys  And said  We did everything  Because of you  And I'm going  Wow you know  This is weird  Like private parts  Was a training film  For these guys  Yeah  You know what I mean  Yeah  And it's like  You know 
[03:40:00]  I always thought of  Howard as like  The first guy  That ever went to  Acapulco  You know  The first guy  To ever go to  Acapulco  Didn't have a good time  You know what I mean  He was like  You know  The bugs  And the cracking  The bushes open  With a machete  And you know  Getting bit by snakes  And stuff  And then 200 years later  There's a bunch  Of these young guys  Sitting on a beach  In a lounge chair  Going  Hi I'm booger  You know  I invented  Acapulco  Robin  All the walls  Were broken down  Until now  Which is this new frontier 
[03:40:30]  Which I'm totally fascinated by  I think it's great  Yeah it's a blast  Here's a question  Because I can't do  Any impressions at all  Of all the like  Ones you do  Like what's the one  That's like the one  That you're like  Fucking I'm glad  I can do that one  Like the most obscure  Or like hardest one  It depends on  You could take any voice  And put it in the most  Absurd situation  And I don't mean like  The 80's  Stand up comedy routine  Like you know  Jack Nicholson's dog  It might sound  Something like this  Or you know 
[03:41:00]  That kind of stuff  I mean I liked  When you took somebody  And put them in  It's like  The comedians  The old comedians  Used to hate  The young comedians  Because they  Claimed these guys  Needed to work blue  To be funny  Meanwhile  Those old guys  Were the dirtiest  Bastards in the world  If you ever hear  Outtakes and roasts  And stuff  You know  And I used to say  Man it would be  Just so funny  I'd give anything  To go back and see  Like George Dice  Burns  You know  So I'm standing  In the bank line  With my tongue 
[03:41:30]  Up this chick's ass  What else is that  To do  Oh George  Never mind  Gracie  Or uh  You know  I grew up in the old days  I loved Bob Hope  Yeah  Hey hi  Hey this is  Bob Big Up  From Heaven Hope  Hey how about that death  Hey this is Bob  Who  You know  They say that death  Is just a new beginning  And hey  It might be a new beginning  But I still look like  The old ending  I still carry my 
[03:42:00]  Medical alert bracelet  In case I fall down  A flight of clouds  Hey how about that  Gaucoma  Creaming your coffee  Squeeze it right in there  Yeah  Keep the motor running  Boys  These jokes are  Yeah  Speaking of radio  A lot of people  Are calling in  Saying you do  A great Grish man  Oh well yeah  You know  He was one of those guys  That kind of 
[03:42:30]  Had that voice  That Zap Brannigan  Wound up doing  And the thing is  I knew Phil Hartman  Before he died  He was really cool  When I was still in New York  And I was up to nothing  You know  I just left  Radio  And I get this phone call  My wife got the call  And I'm on my way home  Out of the belly of the beast  And I hear the gates  Clang shut behind me  And my wife calls me  She says  You won't believe  Who I was talking to  For like an hour  I said who  She said Phil Hartman  He went on and on

[03:45:00]  Are flying around  All night here in L.A.  Terror  There's a lot of terror  There's just nothing  But terror  And I believe  In an America  Where a man can  Come home  After a hard day's work  And be able  To put food  On his family  And Rumsfeld  Is just as much  Of a dummy  He's like you know  Things are more  Like they are now  Than they've ever  Been before  What  And Karl Rove

[03:51:30]  And you find out nothing  You give them money  And they tell you that  You know  A couple of dagos  Got on a boat  And came over here  Right  It's about the size of it  Although our own  Sam the intern there  Is related to  Thomas Jefferson  Thomas Jefferson  So he says  So he says  He brought in his family tree  Shit  Where's mine  He brought in his family tree  I can't read it  Why weren't copies made  Why don't I have a  Why don't I have  I am Sam  Where is Sam  This is his family tree

[03:52:30]  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Grandfather  Who the hell  Was Miles Standish  Miles Standish  The Mayflower  What  Came over on the Mayflower  What  He was the head  Muckety Muck  Alright  On the Mayflower  Alrighty  Are you kidding me  Wow this guy's got some  Some blood in him  Is he Samuel Wood Roberts  Is that who he is  Go to the beginning  Because I see number one  He's related to  William the Conqueror  The King of England  Stop it  Where is that 
[03:53:00]  Number 31  And then father  Get out of here  How could you have this many  Really cool people  In your family  Right  This is not  Really  I love this  This guy comes from  Royalty  And he's getting  Getting us our  Starbucks coffee today  William the Conqueror  He comes from  William the Conqueror  And he's like  Conquering Starbucks  Hey faggot  Conquer that  Fat free muffin  Wait on why  With the rest of us

[03:54:00]  And Thomas Jefferson  It's also related  To Mary Hart  I think this is  Bullshit  I think he paid money  To have this done  And if you pay money  You pay enough money  You'll get  Good relatives  You have to go to  Tiredofbeingazilch.com  Right  Bring up a good point  If you're going to go down  This road  And you're going to  Pay people  You've got to think  These people are going to  Have to give you  Someone cool  Yeah  In your lineage  Of course  William the Conqueror 
[03:54:30]  King of England  That's pretty cool  Matilda of Germany  Alright  Henry the second  King of England  Pretty impressive  Henry the third  Of course  He'd be related  To all of them  Because they're all related  Are they  Yeah  Alright  I want to get  My family tree now  This is exciting  Oh that would be  Sir and Baron  Andrew Windsor  A Baron  You do 
[03:55:00]  I know  The Pierce's  We were related to  They brought ice cream  Into Jersey City  That's nobody  No that's pretty  John is calling us out  On something here  John go ahead  Hey Opie  You were dead on  Calling Bravo Sierra  On that guy  That dicks in the face  Thing is an old  Sam Kinison bit  Oh that was  Yeah  If you listen to  The comedy channel  They play it  Every now and then  It is though  But it is something  That people have done  Shenanigans  Yeah it's something  That people have done  Hey you guys got it  You call them  Talk to you later  Alright 
[03:55:30]  Bye  Let's say  Hi to Liz  She needs some advice  On a colonoscopy  Liz what's up  Hello  We lost Liz  Alright  I'm gonna Liz  Here's Sam  I am Sam  There he is  What's up Sam  Hi everybody  You're not related  To William the Conqueror  Yeah  Yeah  Isn't he right at the top there  I swear to God  That tree is legit  How is it legit  I swear to God  We  On a family reunion 
[03:56:00]  A few years ago  They put out  This book  That  Like this big thick book  That has  All these trees  Laid out  By all the divisions  And my dad  Who's now an avid listener  Was listening the day  That you guys had me on  Talking about  You know  Bringing some  Thomas Jefferson stuff  Or something  So that day  He went through the book  And actually  Typed that out  And then  Yeah but it's confusing  I know  That's why I had to  Make the notes on it  Because  Now I'm looking at this  Is this  Because I see 
[03:56:30]  Mother of  Father of  Blah blah blah  In the first column  Yeah  But then there's  None of that here  In the second column  Where Thomas Jefferson is  Right  The second column  Is  The second  Third  Fourth columns  Are  Extended generation  It seems to split  After  Peter  Field  Jefferson  On both of those  And then goes to  John Robert Jefferson  So is this like 
[03:57:00]  Maybe one side  Of the family  And then the other side  This is all  This is all  My dad's side  This is all  Your dad's side  So  So  Thomas Jefferson  The second  Is right there  This is just the  Mother and father of  So Thomas Jefferson  The second  Would be the  Grandfather  Making the  President Thomas Jefferson  The first cousin  The great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  First cousin  I'll say he is  Roger Williams  Founder of Rhode Island 
[03:57:30]  Is number 13  That's pretty cool  And now  Miles Standish  Yep  That  This looks like  A pretty straightforward  Family tree thing here  Right  He would be  The grandfather  The great  Great  Great  Great  Great  Great  So now  Miles Standish  Is the father of  Josius Standish  Is that what I'm  Yeah  That's what it looks like  And then that's the father  Of Mercy Standish  The father of  Mary  Well  Wheelock  Yes  Wheelock  They had great names  Back then  What was your last name 
[03:58:00]  I don't know  Looks at a wheel lock  Wheelock  You just pick them  And then that  That  And then it goes to  Your father and you  Right  Wow  That's pretty impressive  That's it  That's the way  The tree  And I feel bad  That you're getting  Our stuff for us  They were looking  They were looking  For black blood  In there somewhere  And my mom was  Because it's not there  You know  Because Thomas Jefferson  Is a cousin  So it's not  His blood  Yeah  So my mom  Was trying to go  Through her family tree 
[03:58:30]  But my mom's  Family gets a little  Shady at points  So they can't exactly  Trace back  There's a lot of shade  On her side  They can't trace it  All the way  Back terribly far  That's why I'm amazed  That you get this far  Back  With a family tree  Because I know  I could probably  Go back to my  Great grandfather  And then it would  Just get lost  In some vendetta  Somewhere in Sicily  It gets really shady  After those trips  To Oakland  That's very cool Sam 
[03:59:00]  But yeah  That's the tree  Do you have any  Memorabilia  From these people  No I mean  There's got to be  Something somewhere  In the family  And  William the Conqueror's  Sword  Or something  Wouldn't that be cool  If I can find  Anything at all  I will absolutely  Bring it in  You see any paintings  Of William the Conqueror  What did he look like  Was he a big fella  I have no clue  My dad handed me that  And he's like  Yeah  I would so be researching  William the Conqueror  Died in 1087  What did he do  What did he conquer  Well Bill 
[03:59:30]  He was better known  As Duke of Normandy  Is that it  He was William the Bastard  His rule was stern  Tell him Fred  My rule was stern  It's laced  Faced with many battles  The most famous  Was October 14th  1066  He led the Normans  To defeat the English forces  In the celebrated  Battle of Hastings  Wow  On Christmas day  He was crowned  The King of England  In the famed  Westminster Abbey 
[04:00:00]  Wow  This guy was like  The real deal  Oh yeah  An OG  Are you allowed  Like a real OG  Are you allowed  To just go to  The Westminster Abbey  And say hey  I'm related to the dude  You know I've never tried  But I gotta assume  Yeah I'll just bring  The tree  That little print out  That would be like  Pretty good  You're royalty  I um  Pass forward a thousand years  Who was  Who was  This young Sam  The intern  Oh this is  Here he would get  Muffins and coffee 
[04:00:30]  For a man with  How do you do  I'm Sam  This is pretty  Rude  The twisted part  Of William the Conqueror's  Death  He died September 9th  1087  At the age of 60 years old  Within minutes  The servants stole  Everything from his residence  Including his clothes  And left his swollen  Lifeless body  Naked on the floor  That's where you get  The black  Oh  There 
[04:01:00]  Let's see  There you go  There's your proof buddy  An obscure knight  Named her loon  Was the first  To discover  William's nude body  At his own expense  It was not a wealthy man  He arranged for the body  To be prepared  For the funeral  Um  And transported to Cain  Just before the solemn  Funeral procession  Reached the church  The cries of fire  Were heard  The mourners were  Forced to put his coffin  Down and go fight  A fire  Eventually they put  The fire out  Returned to the body  And continued it  Along its way  To the church  The funeral was held 
[04:01:30]  On a blisteringly  Hot day  As a result  His abscess  Had swelled  And became putrid  When they tried  To fit William's body  Into a custom made  Sacophagus  They found out  It had swelled so much  It wouldn't fit in  What to do  They squeezed him in  They tried to push him  To no avail  Then they pushed  His swollen abdominal wall  And William the Conqueror's body  Burst like a popped balloon  Ugh  The pus and putrefaction  Drenched the king's burial garb 
[04:02:00]  The stench filled the chapel  The mourners raced for the door  Their hands covering their noses  Needless to say  They buried him very quickly  That's grandpa  That's it  It said what happened  Was he got thrown  A horse through him  Yeah  Onto the saddle's iron pommel  Which is that big knob  On the front  Ooh  And his injuries were internal  The saddle burst his intestines  And waist matter  Began to fill  And poison his intestines  Is that what happens  Yeah  No 
[04:02:30]  I was riding  And the horn of the saddle  Went up my ass  Yeah  I swear  I was on a horse  You go to the doctor  With the saddle up your ass  Pantitis  Hmm  Well very good Sam  Couldn't fix that  I guess back then  There was no surgery  He was constantly ridiculed  For being a fat man  Huh  You're a skinny guy  Sure am  That's right  I'll take after  William the Conqueror  No sir  So you think when the servants  Kind of raided the place  There's that one relative  Who was slow  And then there was Kathy  With a limp
