<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting a wild weekend: high-speed driving in an exotic car, shooting his malfunctioning Windows computer with an AR-15 (describing the sounds and potential legal ramifications), and extensive PalTalk use, observing considerable user drama. This led to a Mac vs. Windows debate, fueled by Anthony's frustrations.  Kevin Smith, a guest throughout the entire show, commented on these antics and shared his own computer woes and Mac preference.  Other topics discussed included Smith's new book, *My Boring-Ass Life*; the New England Patriots' cheating allegations; listener emails; a RedTube video of a masturbating dog; a Comic-Con heckling incident involving Smith; and several YouTube videos of people being tased by security.

The show continued with a discussion about a viral video of a man repeatedly tased, sparking a debate on the use of tasers by law enforcement and security, featuring humorous and crude commentary on the victims' reactions. This evolved into discussions of other viral videos: a man urinating on a dying woman, and a failed liquor store robbery, touching upon YouTube content boundaries and censorship. Callers shared personal anecdotes about tasering their partners with homemade devices.  The hosts also discussed the "pain gun," a microwave-based military weapon. Marge from the Little Shelter called to solicit donations due to overcrowding. The segment concluded with discussion of Maureen McCormick's upcoming book hinting at a lesbian relationship between her and Eve Plumb on *The Brady Bunch*, leading to speculation about other cast member relationships, including an analysis of Mr. Brady's bathing suit in a Hawaiian episode, and a brief mention of a review of "Into the Wild".

The next segment began speculating about salacious content in a book about a reality TV show, detailing alleged on-set activities and a cast member's departure.  This transitioned to Smith's experiences on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* and *Late Show with David Letterman*, including how appearing on Leno jeopardized a return to Letterman. A significant portion focused on *Kid Nation*, with humorous reactions to clips showing distressed children, discussing the show's potentially exploitative nature. The segment then devolved into a graphic and explicit discussion about pornography preferences, including detailed descriptions of various websites and fetishes, particularly focusing on female genitalia, with Smith sharing his preferences and the hosts participating enthusiastically. The segment concluded with Smith discussing his upcoming appearance on *Late Show with David Letterman*.

The show continued its explicit focus on pornography, with the hosts and Smith browsing and commenting on websites showcasing defecation videos, including "poobutton.com," "twogirlsonecup.com," and "cupchicks.com," using graphic language. They discussed their pornography experiences, preferences, and reactions, delved into massages with sexual implications, and compared the value of different pornography types based on rarity or shock value.  A "Miss PalTalk" contest ensued, with detailed descriptions of the winning entry involving explicit sexual acts.  A brief discussion of a Star Wars anti-smoking PSA featuring R2-D2 and C-3PO concluded this segment, with recurring technical difficulties involving E-Rock's struggles to display specific pornographic content providing comedic fodder.

The final segment began with a discussion about the obsolescence of physical media archives due to readily available online content. This transitioned to an anecdote about Opie's trip with Jason Muse to a Bullwinkle retrospective, where Muse was robbed of his Punisher shirt while buying weed. Listener calls followed, discussing childhood memories: Channel 11's interactive games, "Fractured Flickers" cartoons, Uncle Floyd's show, 80s commercials (including a Gold Digger Jeans commercial with a caller claiming to be an extra), and a mocked commercial about prejudice. A lengthy, critical analysis of a Winnie the Pooh PSA about child sexual abuse followed, focusing on the juxtaposition of beloved characters with a serious subject and the PSA's perceived ineffectiveness. A brief interview with Samuel L. Jackson promoting "Snakes on a Plane" was included. The show concluded with more listener calls, further commentary on the Pooh PSA, and promotional mentions of Kevin Smith's upcoming projects, including his appearance on Letterman. Kevin Smith remained a guest throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man, I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  That he's very, very depressed because his refrigerator door fell off. 
[00:01:00]  It made a break for Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Australians whose national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What the hell is going on? 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning to ya.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Monday edition.  And we got a lot to do.  We got Kevin Smith.  He's in the elevator as we speak.  He's going to do the whole show with us.  From time to time, he comes in and just hangs.  He loves the radio show that much.  I was supposed to hang out with him last night.  He had a big poker game going on.  And I was like, there's no way I can drive into Jersey for like an hour and a half and 
[00:02:00]  then play poker and do like an all-nighter because that was their plan.  I believe he's been up all night playing poker.  And I was going to do the same thing, but I didn't sleep late enough yesterday.  If I would have slept till like five in the afternoon, then I could have done it.  I would have stayed up the whole night.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're showing responsibility?  I had to.  I know.  I got everyone.  Oh, my God.  Mark the day.  Dude, everyone I told this to said the same thing.  It's like, what?  Are you crazy? 
[00:02:30]  And I couldn't.  I couldn't.  I would have been a wreck.  If I would have slept late, it would have been fine.  But I woke up too early and I was out late like Saturday night, Friday night.  So I didn't go.  So you didn't play all-night poker with Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  You did drive 120 miles an hour on the way into work today.  Yeah, that was fun.  And you might have shot off some firearms over the weekend.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  All right, so you're almost showing responsibility.  I had a good fun Anthony weekend.  Yeah.  Driving fast, exotic cars and shooting.  When's your girl coming home, man?  She will be home tonight.  All right, good.  That's good for the radio show.  She's been out in Colorado with her sister since Thursday.  And yes, people have noticed that I've mysteriously just been like out, hanging out, drinking, driving.  I talked to you for about a half hour. 
[00:03:30]  I talked to you for about a half hour before the show today.  I learned that you're out all night, Friday and Saturday.  I did a little FH Riley's, right?  Yeah.  I'm flying.  And then you got an exotic car all weekend.  So you're driving 100 to 125 miles an hour.  Yeah.  I was being good on the highways and stuff.  It was just occasionally if I felt like getting somewhere really quickly or if I got lost or made a mistake, wrong turn.  Oh, was I just making up for that lost time?  Yeah.  Vroom. 
[00:04:00]  Vroom.  Yeah.  And then I had the Ford GT out this weekend.  Oh, nice.  And yeah, because the weather was perfect for it.  And that thing is just a beast.  It's a nice monster car.  And it's very fast, very fun to drive.  Hugs the road.  It's just beautiful.  And then I was out.  Yeah.  I'm out at parties, hanging out, having a good time.  And then last night I was going to go to Kevin Smith's and play a little poker. 
[00:04:30]  And I was just like, you know, it's Sunday.  For the love of God.  I got the show to do.  And then I got the gym afterwards.  I'll be a wreck.  So, yeah, I was being a little responsible.  But I'm looking at Pal Talk.  You made some kind of video because they're all talking about it.  Well, I was very angry.  Even though you haven't released your latest video yet.  No, I'm editing it on my Mac.  My wonderful.  I love Mac.  And this isn't even for the sponsor or anything.  I love Mac.  I am loathing Windows. 
[00:05:00]  Loathing it.  And not even Vista.  I tried Vista once.  You remember how that ended.  Sure.  It ended up on YouTube.  You could find it.  It's me running a Vista DVD, CD, DVD through a shredder because it wouldn't load in my computer.  And people are goofing on me.  Your computer must suck.  No.  It was Vista ready when I bought it.  Fake.  So fake.  Fake, fake, fake.  So I shredded that. 
[00:05:30]  And it's not only Vista.  It's just Windows itself.  I've used it for so many years and so have everybody else.  And they're just used to the pain in the ass that it is.  And the hours that it takes to do anything when there is some kind of problem.  You get a problem on Windows, you have to dedicate the entire, like 10 hours.  You're sitting there going, why?  No, the USB device is plugged in. 
[00:06:00]  No, I downloaded the latest drivers.  Now my friends are telling me don't because the drivers screw it up.  Oh, no, I'm having a conflict.  All right, let me go to system devices.  Oh, there's an exclamation point next to that one.  I don't even know what it means.  There's problems with Windows that with Mac, I just don't get.  I plug stuff in and it identifies it.  It shows it and it works.  It's great.  I had an external hard drive. 
[00:06:30]  I just plug it right in.  Jimmy was having problems too.  Was it with Windows?  With my Windows and with my Mac.  But it wasn't a Mac problem.  It was a problem of something I bought.  A device problem?  Mine wasn't.  I had my webcam.  Now I go on PalTalk a lot.  I have fun.  It's a blast.  I was listening to the fan room last night and it was just an hour and a half to two  hours of drama going on.  People yelling at each other.  Oh, about message board stuff.  And this one's talking about that one.  It was so damn entertaining.  I didn't want to turn my camera on.  I didn't have it on. 
[00:07:00]  I was just lurking in the background with a volume up.  Just listening to HTG going bull crap on people.  About what?  Oh, just angry at this one.  And this one's spouting off lies and rumors about that one.  And they're telling stuff about this person.  It was more drama than a soap opera.  But I was compelled.  I could not stop listening.  It's gotten to that point because what you just described was me, you, and Jimmy bitching  and complaining about the message boards and what they do to us. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  But now they're doing it to each other.  I actually heard HTG, Happy Typing Girl, at one point she goes, it's called eating your  own.  Thank you.  And I'm like, there.  Thank you.  She's using Hopi's jargon.  Thank you.  So that was going on.  It's very simple.  And of course I have my Mac.  Wait, can I just jump in?  It is so simple.  Just eat your own.  Well, apparently they are.  It's the easiest thing to do.  Oh, they are.  Good.  So I was listening to that for a while because I have the Windows computer, which, because 
[00:08:00]  PalTalk, for some reason, isn't on Mac yet.  I got to talk to PalTalk people because I got a couple issues with a couple of things,  but they say it's coming soon for Mac.  It's just for Windows now.  So I got my Windows computer with that going on.  And then I got my Mac thing and I'm doing a little, you know, animation stuff, just having  a little fun with the Mac.  And then I wanted to get my cam going.  So I go to turn on my camera.  I check my camera first.  And it's one of these Logitech Orbit things that we have all over the place here. 
[00:08:30]  And it works fine.  I go to use it in PalTalk and my whole computer just crashes now.  It just crashes.  So I get my computer running again and without the camera, I hit the speaker down the microphone  and just go, I hate Windows.  My camera doesn't work.  And people are just laughing at me and giving me advice.  You know, is it plugged in?  They're being all smartasses.  Did you plug it in and unplug it, plug it back in? 
[00:09:00]  They're being all like smartasses and stuff.  So I ran through all that.  I eliminated the program, reloaded the programs, did everything.  And again, you're spending hours doing this.  So I got so pissed.  I was so angry at this point.  It's about 10.30, 10.45 at night.  Now I'm up past my Betty by time.  And I'm trying to be responsible.  But now I'm so, I get obsessed with the computer. 
[00:09:30]  I got to fix something before I go to bed or it just bugs me.  Unfixable.  So I was so angry.  I took the computer.  I went downstairs.  I took a couple of my video cameras downstairs.  And I made like almost a sequel to my Vista video, which entailed my version of customer service, which if you ask them what was wrong, first of all, you wouldn't get a live person.  Then you'd get somebody.  Hello, my name is Steve. 
[00:10:00]  Can I help you?  You're not Steve.  Your name isn't Steve.  Hello, my name is Bobby.  You're not Bobby.  And you're calling, I'm calling you from like 10,000 miles away.  You don't know how to fix this.  So I took the computer downstairs and my AR-15.  And I backed the computer up with some boxes from the basement of junk I don't use. 
[00:10:30]  And I did a little video on how you should deal with a Windows-based computer.  And I locked, I loaded, and let it rip.  And it was so loud.  Oh, is it loud.  First of all, the, uh...  You shot your computer?  I shot my computer.  But you don't live like in the woods.  Exactly.  I live in suburbia, and it was loud.  And I fully expected the police to show up. 
[00:11:00]  This is showing responsibility?  There it is.  I fire off the round.  There's the smell and smoke of just cordite.  It smells wonderful.  But I'm thinking, uh-oh, this could be trouble.  So I put my rifle away.  And I finish the video first.  And then I put everything away.  I go upstairs with the video stuff.  And I just start putting it on my computer and editing.  It looks great.  It looks great.  The whole computer shook.  Made a little hole going in.  Nice big hole coming out.  Went right through the box that I had backing it up with all kinds of stuff. 
[00:11:30]  Went through the bottom part of my green screen.  Hit the floor.  Hit the wall.  And I found the actual slug.  There wasn't much left of it, of the pullet.  You're going insane.  No, it was great.  Oh, what a feeling of accomplishment.  At this point, I wish you stayed up all night playing porn with Kevin Smith.  You idiot.  The police are going to show up.  Yeah, you can't shoot guns in suburbia.  He's going to answer the door with a shirt on.  And when they walk in, he's going to have nothing on underneath.  He's just going to be nude.  And the whole house is going to smell like gun smoke. 
[00:12:00]  And he's just going to say, the drivers wouldn't load, officer.  The driver, exactly.  The stupid drivers wouldn't load.  And they didn't work.  It needed to be taught a lesson.  I corrected that computer.  My computer wouldn't reboot, sir.  Wouldn't reboot.  Wouldn't.  With black socks.  Wouldn't.  Underpants on.  No, no underpants.  Everything just shows.  Where's your girlfriend?  Just completely naked.  Where's your girlfriend?  She's not here, officer.  That's what I thought.  I'm going, all right, that was really loud.  The cops have got to show up. 
[00:12:30]  And then I got to explain what it was and why there's no sign of my girlfriend and no  one's seen her in days because she's been, she's out in Colorado visiting family.  Monday is my favorite day to do the radio show because we never know what we're going  to get from Anthony's weekend.  It's, there's usually something going on.  The week, my week is very mundane.  It's my weekends.  I really put a lot of effort.  I know that you borrowed a car from the car club.  So you were going 125 miles an hour.  That's my baby.  And, uh, and you're shooting guns.  That's, uh, that's good. 
[00:13:00]  That's good.  So when is this video going to debut online?  Oh, I'm finishing it today.  I actually went back upstairs to my Mac and see that, that right there tells you a little  something about, uh, uh, windows and, and Mac.  I was able to start editing my video on Mac of me shooting my PC.  Dave, no problems there.  I plugged my camera in my final cut pro loaded up and there it was me shooting my computer 
[00:13:30]  right there.  And then I'm editing, you know, the neighbors are scared cause they already think you're  in the mafia and now, and now they're hearing like guns going off in your house.  I don't know if they heard it.  It was, uh, I got, I got a pretty, my basement by the way is huge and it's very long.  So you, I could, I could set up a range down there if I wanted to.  It's very long.  I was really far away.  And, uh, but it being down in there, the echo, you know, the cement wall, it's not a 
[00:14:00]  finished basement was very loud.  I don't know how much of that got outside, but no one, no one showed up.  I mean, it was, uh, they already see you leaving at like four 30 in the morning.  I know it's illegal.  And if anybody even questions it, I will swear it was a bit, um, that I did with some kind  of CGI special effects and, uh, sound effects and a full muzzle flash, uh, that I, I downloaded  off the web and used, uh, after effects to, uh, put on there. 
[00:14:30]  And it wasn't really a gunshot.  If any law enforcement people listening and, you know, think this is an admission of guilt,  I will say that we do do an entertainment program here and I was using CGI to do it.  I've become very proficient at CGI for this weird reference, but anyone who remembers Tom  Cruz from TAPS, that's who you are.  It's beautiful, man.  I remember that one. 
[00:15:00]  I'm not a psychopath.  My camera wouldn't work.  Wow.  I was going to talk about my weekend, which was me riding my bicycle last night for 40  minutes along the water.  And I went and saw Into the Wild and that was a terrific movie.  And then I, I caught up on Kid Nation and watched a bunch of kids cry for an hour and  a half.  That I want to see.  I've heard that show is very funny.  F my stupid weekend stories.  If I hadn't, uh, used the 12 gauge on my TV, I'd watch it.  But I was very angry at my television and I had, I'm kidding. 
[00:15:30]  Of course, Jimmy, I wouldn't shoot my television.  We should talk these things over before the show because like we should go in order of  weekends.  There's no way bicycle story or me trying to load Logitech remote control thing follows.  I shot my computer.  I had to work that way.  It blew up our spot.  It tasks me.  It tasks me.  And I will have it.  Uh, this just in.  The neighbors were hoping for a suicide.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  You really live in the wrong neighborhood.  You know that.  And then, and then, you know that.  Then I'm thinking, cause all this stuff goes through your head because it was, it was very  loud.  Yeah.  I had to go upstairs to my bedroom and, uh, get, I had to, first of all, I had to put  the rifle away.  Now, if you've, you've, well, I'm sorry, you haven't seen my house.  Why would I?  When I walk up the stairs.  Why would I?  I've only known you for 14 years.  I guess when we hit the 20 year mark, I'll, I'll be invited to your house.  Once the pool's in, everyone's invited over. 
[00:16:30]  Uh, when you walk up the stairs, there's kind of a big window.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, uh, from the street, if you look, you could probably see what's going on.  I had to carry my rifle now back upstairs.  So I'm carrying it upstairs.  I'm trying to like kind of keep it next to me in case anyone's peeking in the window.  So I get it upstairs and then I need my firewire cable to plug my camera in.  So now I'm coming back downstairs with what looks like rope.  Cause I have this spool of firewire cable and I'm just thinking if someone's looking in, 
[00:17:00]  they really must be wondering what's going on.  They, they hear a shot.  I'm coming down with some kind of stuff to bind with.  Are you feeling all right?  I'm fine.  I felt great.  It was wonderful.  You want Kenny to take your temperature?  No, it's fine.  I feel like a lunatic.  I feel cool today.  You sound like a lunatic.  It was fun.  You don't enjoy, uh, uh, shooting, uh, rifles.  You're not allowed to be alone on weekends. 
[00:17:30]  No?  No!  Yeah.  I was lonely.  My girlfriend's been away.  I was lonely.  She'll be back tonight though.  Yeah.  Not soon enough.  Why is she in Colorado?  Did she want to go to Columbine to find someplace peaceful and relaxing?  Wow, man.  That's a hell of a weekend.  It was a fun weekend.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Got a little song for you.  Oh.  France weekend. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  Oh.  This was me.  In your underpants.  Sliding across the floor.  Except it's a little different, I'm sure.  It was exactly.  A little different.  You know.  Like risky business.  Yeah, Tom Cruise having a little fun, a little house party.  Yeah.  I was home alone having fun. 
[00:18:30]  I was home alone doing nothing, a little house party.  I was home alone having fun.  Still like it.  Still like it.  Still like it.  That kind of music just as soon as we go.  I'm in a missile.  I'm in a missile.  I'm in a missile.  I'm in a missile.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Europeans.  Get rid of them. 
[00:19:00]  Great.  That's a wonderful weekend right there.  It was.  It was fun.  Some dope.  Enough about computer talk.  How about them Pats?  That's Jay from Boston.  That was computer talk?  Exactly.  Tech talk with Anthony.  Murder it.  You know what's funny about the Pats victory over the weekend?  Yeah.  New York papers are now calling them the cheaters.  The cheaters.  They don't even say the Pats anymore in the New York papers.  It's cheaters are 3-0. 
[00:19:30]  Cheaters 3-0.  Cheaters.  What's up?  I don't remember that city.  What city just had?  Is that an expansion team?  The cheaters.  The cheaters.  They got to have that.  Not the cheaters.  The cheaters.  Why don't we take a break?  Kevin Smith, he came early and he's just been sitting in the green room.  Yeah, we'll get him in here.  We got off on a tangent here.  So we're going to take our first break.  It's a very, very busy Monday.  Who else is coming in today?  It was supposed to be Nikki Sixx, but he's in Wednesday instead.  Oh, Wednesday?  Okay.  Wednesday.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-D. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, and A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Off to a good start here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's my deal, Wade.  Really fast.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy here.  Coke Logic from Whackbag.  He writes,  It's a little late, but Ant is great at troubleshooting computer problems.  Leadbelly writes,  Me and Jimmy are happy.  Dallas is 3-0.  Happy with the Cowboys win there, Jimmy? 
[00:20:30]  It's funny, but it was 3-3 the last time I looked, and then they wound up winning.  I'm not a good fan.  Leadbelly from FBA also writes,  No girlfriend and no computer makes Anthony go crazy.  A little bit.  Did you hear any of that in the green room, Kevin Smith?  I heard it all, sir.  I was listening to it all.  I'm like, I can't believe I arrived here early and on time to sit here and listen to rantings of a man  who only recently got hip to how bad PC is.  Were you never a Mac guy before?  No, I had been a Mac guy on and off a little bit. 
[00:21:00]  Superior machine, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  For what I'm doing, you know something?  I didn't realize that, because all I did was gaming, for the most part.  And for that, I needed my Windows computer, because that's all the games that were available.  Right.  Pong for Mac, I wasn't really into, you know, I want to play good games.  And then it just got to the point where I try to do anything on a Windows computer,  and it's just, it's asking me for things.  Nothing works. 
[00:21:30]  You can buy a Windows computer, a Windows-based computer,  and it'll work for like, I don't know, six, eight months probably.  Pretty good.  And then things just start falling apart on it.  This doesn't work.  This doesn't identify this anymore.  And troubleshooting it yourself, like I said, you're spending eight to ten hours.  I've been there ten hours just trying to fix something,  and then gone, oh, okay, it's fixed, and I completely forgot what I did.  So if it happens again, it's another ten hours.  I'm not in any machine where the mouse has a left click and a right click. 
[00:22:00]  You don't like that left and right click?  One click once is enough.  See, some of the programs I use, though, you need that.  So I do use a Microsoft mouse on my Mac.  Do you really?  So I could left click and right click.  I need both clicks.  It's like having a hooker who will do it all,  and then still you insist on handling yourself.  I don't know.  You've got the best thing.  I've been frustrated.  I don't like to put the control key.  I'm like, wait, can I jump in here a second? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, he shot a computer last night.  I heard that.  Screw the Windows versus Mac.  The guy.  He can understand.  The guy is shooting.  He can understand.  I don't know when they're going like, he's out of his mind.  He's shooting guns in his basement.  He's not.  This isn't Montana.  It's Long Island.  In a Jewish neighborhood.  It's like a police shooting range, my bitch.  I'm on MySpace holding a very lethal automatic weapon  and thinking to myself, I don't know that guy at all.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I wanted to try to instill fear into anybody that might try to carjack me. 
[00:23:00]  I want to be his friend.  Maybe I don't want to be his friend.  Yeah, maybe not.  I don't want to be in that dude's top eight.  I get a lot of NRA literature.  I do enjoy my weaponry, but I rarely use it.  I think I've fired a gun like once in my life.  That's it.  Really?  Scary?  Scary?  Or you like it?  There's too much kick to it.  Yeah.  It hurt my shoulder a little bit.  I wasn't prepared.  And they told me to.  It was going to have some kick to it.  I'm like, what does that mean?  I fired a BB gun.  How bad can it be?  Yeah.  It must have been an old one. 
[00:23:30]  It was pretty bad.  A lot of the newer guns, they don't do that anymore.  No?  No kick.  Yeah, not much.  You've convinced me.  I'm into guns again.  All right.  Pick one up.  Let's go shoot something.  Yeah.  I was going to use the shotgun, but then I looked around the basement.  It could do a little collateral damage.  You know what?  I'm going to use a shotgun.  Once again, showing a little responsibility.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Because I looked around, I'm like, eh.  See, when Anthony shows responsibility, it's a little different than our responsibility that we show.  It's a little rough.  Thank God your girlfriend's coming home today.  Yeah, yeah.  Every once in a while, the aunt's left alone, and it's never good. 
[00:24:00]  I've been alone since Thursday, and I'm not an alone kind of guy.  I'm one of those guys, like, I like having a girlfriend.  I like having, you know, friends and stuff.  If I'm alone around the house, I'm just kind of like, I'm on the computer a little, and  then I'll go, all right, let me cruise around.  I'll drive around a little bit.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not drive around a little bit.  Tell Kevin.  I mean, he'll-  I drive around.  I like driving fast, exotic cars.  Right.  And just drive around like that.  And what does that entail, joining a car club? 
[00:24:30]  You just get to work on, use a bunch of different cars?  You get, yeah, you get whatever-  It's like a menu.  Car you want.  Access to weird cars.  Yeah, yeah, all kinds.  How much does that kind of thing cost?  I don't know, it's a lot of money.  Is it annual or monthly?  It's annual, and it's just, it's a lot of money.  That sounds like rich man shenanigans.  It is, it is.  It's ridiculous.  Too much disposable income.  It was-  Probably.  You're driving an expensive car.  It probably is.  So, he was telling me in the office, you know, it's the end of his weekend alone, and he  decided to drive to work about 125 miles an hour. 
[00:25:00]  Well, I had to get the GT, the Ford GT, not the Mustang.  You had to get the car back to the car club.  So, I drove it in, and there's not much traffic.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  So, you could really, the expressway, woof, woof, you could move.  So, I wanted to, you know, get in fast.  Why'd you drive a Taurus?  I'd drive a Taurus.  Perhaps a Topaz.  Do they have a Dodge Neon in that car club?  I haven't seen one.  Like a 94, 95? 
[00:25:30]  It might be parked behind the Lotus.  I didn't see it.  I'm a Dodge Aspen wagon.  I'll join the bit.  How about a Saab?  Yeah.  Some Saabs are very nice.  All right.  So, it was a fun weekend.  I had a...  Anything else you want to share?  A fun week?  I'm trying to think.  The rest of the weekend, I don't really remember much of.  Oh, good, good.  Shooting guns going 125 miles an hour.  I'm teasing, of course.  That was fun.  It was a fun weekend.  You sound like the kind of guy that needs somebody there as your Jiminy Cricket. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe you don't want to do that.  Just kind of don't do that.  Maybe there's a better use for your time.  Yeah.  And if nobody's putting you in check, you're like, I'm going to shoot things.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to shoot a computer that...  Well, it annoyed me.  I never would have just shot a guy.  I wouldn't have just looked around the house and gone, I need something to shoot.  The computer looks good.  I was so angered...  Right.  By this computer.  Not to say if I was angered by people, I would start shooting people.  I've been angered by people and I don't even get a thought of shooting them.  Oh, that's most of the time. 
[00:26:30]  I think you're like one bad day from being Tom Berenger and betrayed.  You think that's...  We're like, we're going on a human hunt.  Give him a gun with six bullets in it.  You're not too far from the truth.  We're just defending ourselves.  You're not too far from the truth, Kevin.  Ant launches into some of these stories and Jimmy and I start looking at each other like,  uh-oh, I think today's the day.  We've got to get the straitjacket.  No, it's...  And Norton's in on that too?  A little bit.  Norton's looking at each other.  Believe it or not, a little bit.  He's weird.  That's weird. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We just notice episodes from Anthony every once in a while.  We all have our weirdness and our fun.  I couldn't wait to come in here and talk about Into the Wild.  I'm like, he trumped every story we could tell about the weekend, so...  You're like, I saw a theater and had somebody entertain me and this guy's like,  I entertain myself.  Who cares?  I make sure...  I videotaped the whole thing so I could edit it down and put it on YouTube as a sequel  to my shredding my Vista disc and my paper shredder.  Which got 1.3 million views. 
[00:27:30]  1.8, my friend.  You're up to 1.8.  It's 1.8, somewhere around there.  1.75.  So we can't wait to see the latest video.  Yeah.  When will it be done?  Today?  Yes.  Okay.  It'll be up on all the video sites.  Will your 1.8 hits on YouTube or...  Yeah, YouTube.  YouTube?  Yeah.  Have you guys been to RedTube yet?  What's RedTube?  RedTube is a pornographic version.  PornoTube is another one.  Yeah, PornoTube is another one.  PornoTube is one.  PornoTube is kind of disappointing, though.  Like, I go there and a lot of them don't work.  It doesn't load very fast. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I've discovered that.  It depends on the video you're watching.  Wait, I'm looking at RedTube.  So this is...  RedTube, I find this...  You don't have to pay for this?  No, it's all free.  Oh, my.  I mean, a lot of it, of course, are just clips of...  Draws from porn movies.  Porn movies.  The homemade stuff is kind of fun.  You find a diamond in the rough there every so often.  It was a masturbating dog video, which I've never seen before.  And it was literally...  It scared me, because I was like, this is it.  The next step in evolution.  Dogs are going to...  They've watched us too closely.  And they figured it out.  Because he's mounted on this other dog. 
[00:28:30]  I don't even know if it was a male or female dog that he was mounted.  But the other dog pulled away, as they sometimes do, even in the human world.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  And this dog, rather than just kind of try to remount, takes his two front paws, balances  on his hind paws, and they have no, you know, opposable digits.  Yeah, yeah.  So he puts his two...  Clasps his two paws around the red thing.  Can you say red thing on this?  I don't think you can say any of this.  Who knows?  But I'm interested.  And starts...  This is probably a story for a little bit.  Going to it. 
[00:29:00]  That we all know so well.  Wow.  I was flabbergasted.  That is some trick.  I mean, I've never seen it.  It kind of scared me, because I'm like, they know.  You know, once you learn to do that, then you develop language skills.  Yeah, that's like the first step.  Then you take over.  To taking over.  It's coming from within.  It's not from without.  Let's see that dog act on Ed Sullivan.  Totally.  With a little jumping poodle.  But it was astounding.  I'd never seen it before.  And he was going to town, man.  Like, he was going to get there.  Or nobody else was going to help him.  He was going to get there. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  And they always tell you, like, oh, they just do it to mate.  It's instinct.  And I looked at that dude, and I was just like, that's me.  That is totally me.  When my wife's like, no, not right now.  And I'm just like, just watch me do it then.  Be involved somehow.  You can just look at it while I do it.  And then afterwards, I'll feel bad.  You have a girl watch you, and then, like, as soon as things are done, you're like, God,  am I not a sexy person?  Totally.  What did I do?  How did you not vomit?  Utter self-loathing, too, where you're like, why did I ask you to watch?  Oh, watch. 
[00:30:00]  You're at my worst.  So shameful.  And you're watching my gut jiggle because my fist is slamming.  Thought it was going to get her all hot.  Totally.  Like, maybe I'll trick her into it.  Like, I'll be like, well, I got it.  Maybe it's a pity thing.  Where she's like, I got to get in there.  Because he's doing a horrible job by his own.  There is the mental state that just changes like that.  Oh, my God.  The second business is done, and you think, like, this is great.  And then you're done, and then you go, wow, that was kind of embarrassing.  Yeah, it goes from sexy to awkward. 
[00:30:30]  If you're ever into, like, the idea of, like, let's do a three-way kind of thing,  you should take care of yourself first and then rethink it.  Rethink.  And then if you still want to go through it, then pursue it.  Because the moment it ends, no matter where you're, especially if you're involved in that  kind of thing, you have to face the reality of, like, I invited this into my life.  Yeah, now you're going, uh-oh.  Yeah, this was such a mistake.  Oh, boy.  This was bad.  Now you're just thinking that half your stuff is going to be gone.  God, RedTube.  All right, Iraq, we get it.  RedTube, I look at it.  This is going to shut down the show.  I can't.  Iraq won't even stop. 
[00:31:00]  Before I went to play poker last night, I had, like, an hour in the hotel room,  so I was trying to send a file to somebody.  I was waiting for them to jump online, so I was like, I'm going to check out RedTube.  And I saw a video that made me feel a little gay for wanting to watch it,  but it said World's Smallest Penis.  And I was just like, well, I've got to know if he's smaller than me.  And I looked at it, and it was.  It was all...  Hung like an acorn?  Beyond that.  It was convex.  Wow.  It was out of preface.  Can you say preface?  I don't know.  What does that mean? 
[00:31:30]  Preface is the skin that, if you're not cut, hangs over it.  Oh, okay.  Probably not.  Preface, what a word.  All preface, nothing peeking out.  And it was literally a thumb and a pinky that was taking care of business.  You can find it.  I think it's on the front page right now.  Look at it.  It's got to be.  You'll blow your mind, man.  You just sit there going, like, I feel huge next to this person.  Who's the person that goes to sleep with this person?  Poor bastard.  Hey, how many dumps do we have so far there, E-Rock?  A lot. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, we have a lot.  Yeah, we've got to be careful.  It's amazing.  Tom's losing his mind somewhere, I'm sure.  Yeah, Tom's freaking out.  Hey, let's talk about your book.  Of course, he just describes his video.  Oh, they're on to me.  They're on to me.  Kevin Smith is in.  He's going to be doing the whole show today, but let's make sure everyone knows you've got  a book out there, Kevin.  I've got a book out.  My Boring-Ass Life, the Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin Smith.  Collects all the blogs that I wrote online.  And I was telling him off mic as he walked in that the first page I opened to, it's an 
[00:32:30]  Opie and Anthony story.  And then the second page, later on in the book, I opened it up.  I swear to God, it was another Opie and Anthony story.  That's the rigged copy that we brought in.  Yeah.  It's just every single one.  Just make sure this is Opie and Anthony on every page.  There's just radio people's names on different books that they give to.  Totally.  Wow, that's great.  Later on, I'm going to call in a man-cow, do the same thing.  Oh, my God.  That is small writing and a thick book.  Yeah.  There's a lot.  Wow, dude.  You wrote a lot. 
[00:33:00]  I did.  Well, that's the thing.  I didn't intend to write a book.  They just, somebody, the Titan, the company that published the book, were like, hey, we  want to publish your blog.  And I was like, right on.  I'm so down with that because it didn't require me to do any work.  It's already done.  It's already done, right?  Pre-did.  That's how you can get it.  Let's not talk about it too much, though.  All right.  It's a good book if you like reading about somebody else's life.  Are you doing any signings this week?  Yeah, I'm going to do a signing.  We can talk about that, sir.  Thank you for the opening.  We're doing a signing on Saturday down at Jay and Silent Bob Secret Stash in Red Bank. 
[00:33:30]  You guys don't go up to Canada, do you?  Doing a Canada signing?  Yeah, we're in Canada.  We were supposed to go up to Canada and say hi to everybody, but we haven't done it yet.  But the signal goes.  And now it's winter, so we've got to wait until next year again.  The signal is up there.  We're signing up there?  We're signing on Wednesday at Indigo on Bay in Toronto.  They're one of their big bookstores or something like that.  But it's a good book.  Reaper comes on on Tuesday, which is a show I directed the pilot for, and the pilots are  good.  But, you know, tune in.  Check out the pilot.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  I'm done whoring.  I also want to...  No, let's just chat.  I want to talk about that nice college boy that confronted you on the microphone.  No, the clip.  We tried to play the clip, but we had a bad copy of it.  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  You know what's really weird about it is the guy who put the clip up was best friends  with the guy in the clip.  With the guy.  What kind of friend does that?  Where it's just like, you look like a real...  Yeah, you're a complete tool.  And explain for everybody that don't know what we're talking about. 
[00:34:30]  A guy gets up on Mike and...  I was at Studio Comic Con.  Yeah, yeah.  6,000 people in this room.  Hall H.  Biggest room there.  Yep.  I've been holding court for like an hour and a half, two hours doing Q&A, and then a  dude gets up and says something to the effect of, are you ever going to make a movie that  doesn't suck or something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just a blatant insult.  He stood up there to just insult you so he could be the guy that insulted you.  Yeah.  I'm the guy that stepped up to the mic. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Remember me?  Put you in your place.  Yeah.  He's going to get all the chicks from it, and it's just going to be great.  He's getting laid off a moment like that.  He thought out, like he thought, how is this going to be?  Like a week down the road, how is this going to affect me?  I'm going to be a big man on campus.  Dude, did you see what he said to Kevin Smith?  That's the guy.  Totally.  That's the guy.  He was a legend.  Jackass.  For about 10 seconds.  Yep.  10 seconds.  But I answered him as honestly as I could.  I just got kind of a different approach where I was just like, I gave him an answer  like, oh, we're doing these two movies next, and they're going to take a detour 
[00:35:30]  from what we've done previously.  So I gave him a very earnest answer, but then quickly kind of added in, like, and I'm  going to get to it as soon as I, and I can't even say the rest of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, you watch the clip.  I didn't hear the clip.  Just watch the clip.  You lambast.  I just did.  I just, it was, you know, you know, when you're on a stage, somebody heckles, it's  like, you're loaded for bear anyway, just in case the moment like that ever happens.  So you always have the back pocket thing going on, and that dude just tripped the back  pocket switch.  I like when he tried to come back to the mic, and you're just like, and he's coming back. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, he just kept coming back.  Just sit down.  And you just kept burying him?  Just went and went and went.  You know how humiliating that is for that dope?  Oh.  That's exactly what he did.  He looked like an idiot.  6,000 people, dude, laughing at you, not with you.  Yeah.  And I was just like, just never attack, it's never a good idea to attack the guy with  a microphone.  And the guy that, like, the people that are there are your fans.  They're there to see you.  So it's not even like you had to convince 6,000 people to like you or like your work.  These people are there for that. 
[00:36:30]  I hadn't spent the previous two hours going like, look, the Semitic community has to be  put down.  I'm tired of these Jews taking our job, you know, where the audience is like, we really  don't like this guy.  Wow.  Everybody jumps up and they're like, we're with this guy.  They were with me from the jump.  And that dude, just such a poorly chosen moment to take a shot.  He should have been tased by security.  Did you see that?  Oh, God.  This is insane to me because I watched on YouTube, if you click on, if you enter that into the 
[00:37:00]  Florida tasing, there are at least 50 different lengths to it.  Different angles, different sound.  You see in the background of some of the shots, the auditorium, which is at half capacity.  So given them the benefit of the doubt, apparently he'd been speaking for an hour or two hours  and then they moved into the Q&A portion.  Maybe some people were like, I don't need to hear the Q&A part.  I heard him speak.  I'm going to leave.  And that's why I kind of half left, half the.  Yeah.  But at 50% capacity, you're happy for anybody to come up to the mic and ask a question, 
[00:37:30]  regardless of how long or stupid or inane it may be.  So the fact that that dude was being rushed off mic was just like, who else is going to  ask a question?  Let him stay, man.  Don't rush him off.  But then like, you know, six security guards and threatening to tase him.  And you hear the dude going, bro, don't tase me.  Bro, when you say, bro, don't tase me, you're getting tased.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[00:38:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[00:38:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow, ow, ow.  The private pile getting hit with the soap and the friggin' pillowcase.  Ow.  Ow!  We kind of liked the fact that he got tased.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't.  The question that dude was asking was not that bad.  He seemed like it wasn't a bad question, but the way he was asking it, he was being like 
[00:39:00]  a douche, but he didn't deserve a tasing for that.  He deserved a tasing for just regardless of, yeah, I can stand up here and talk.  He asked like three questions already.  They were these really, they were kind of rhetorical questions.  They were questions to show that, look, I think you're an ass, so I'm going to bring this  stuff up.  Weren't you in the skull and bones that President Bush is in and stuff?  I was intrigued at that point. 
[00:39:30]  I was like, is he?  Skull and bones?  Oh, my God.  Have I conceded the election?  Is this guy on to something?  Skull and bones?  Is that skull and bones the game?  The brotherhood that no one knows about.  Oh, wow.  So they shut his mic off, and it was time for him to leave, regardless of if he should have  been asked to leave or whatever.  Right.  The second they ask you to leave, leave.  If they start grabbing you and you resist, now they got you unresisting.  So it's not...  They would have you unresisting if you were a police officer.  They were security guards, man.  Yeah.  Those aren't cops. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, they weren't.  They can't pull you over.  I'm amazed they give security guards tasers.  For doing 120 shooting a computer with a rifle.  Those guys...  Yes.  ...can't arrest you.  I expected to get to his last...  Exactly.  I thought it was...  I thought, to me, it's like you're a student at the...  Presumably, he's a student at that college, right?  Maybe he's not, but presumably, he is.  Part of your tuition is a student activities fee for things like this.  They pay to bring in speakers and stuff.  So that dude kind of paid to have that guy there.  Even if his question is totally terrible, which it was just so long-winded, he wouldn't  get a question mark part of it. 
[00:40:30]  But it was a lot of set up to like what...  Ultimately, the final question would have been like, aren't you a douche?  You know, or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But he just...  He took a long time getting there, but he paid for the right to kind of ask that question.  Yeah.  He wasn't like...  He wasn't making...  If he was just making a political statement or asking a genuine question, that's one thing.  But what he's doing is just standing there kind of yelling at a guy without...  Everyone kind of saw what he was doing, which was just kind of being like a little...  Just like a baby.  He was being like a little baby, and they were just moving him off mic. 
[00:41:00]  And the rest of the people paid tuition, too, but they didn't pay to hear this jackass  just yelling without a real...  They might have wanted to hear a real question and answer, and this idiot's just screaming  and monopolizing him at his time.  I think his whole goal was to make a scene that day.  I agree.  I agree.  You're right.  Well, he didn't...  Mission accomplished.  Yeah.  Because he made quite a scene, man.  And we talk about this on the show, and I think he was thinking YouTube video.  Here's my YouTube video.  Everyone's thinking that now.  Everyone's thinking, you know, what can I do to be the star of YouTube for a day?  I just felt like he didn't really have a real question.  Is that a monster on his hands, does anybody think? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  No, because when they're trying to walk him away, he's like yanking his arm away, and  it's like...  He...  That's it?  Yeah, he's like...  He said something like the cops weren't...  That just means if you're in the mall, and somebody's like, well, sir, we don't want  you shopping in the store, and you're like, I have a right to shop in the store.  If security shows up, they could tase you for that.  It's not...  We don't live in an age where you can say, I'm a taxpayer.  I have a right to...  If someone asks you to do something...  My mom and dad used to whip that out at the drop of a hat.  Yeah.  Even to their children.  I'm a taxpayer.  Totally. 
[00:42:00]  We're at a point now where if someone asks you to leave, or you don't...  Just leave.  Just leave.  If the cops ask you to do anything, put your hands behind your back, and you're innocent,  put your hands behind your back.  You're going to go down to the station and then plead your case, because if you resist at  all, you're screwed.  Right.  You're getting tased, you're getting maced, you're getting whatever.  If the cops do it to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Do we all agree these weren't police officers, though?  No, they were security guys.  Right.  Aren't they licensed, though, because he was a presidential candidate at one point.  They might have to have a certain level of security. 
[00:42:30]  They have to have...  Wasn't it like something?  It had to be a little better than a rent-a-cop.  You can't just...  It had to be better than all security.  Well, they weren't security.  Securities, man.  They certainly weren't.  No, no, they weren't.  Back suits with earpieces or anything like that.  But you've got to think they're a little better than...  You can't just buy a taser if you're a security guard and go, I'm going to carry this just  in case.  They had a tasing incident.  This is going back a few months.  I think it was May.  In UCLA, there was a kid in the library who looked a little bit not white, as they say.  A little Middle Eastern or something like that. 
[00:43:00]  And they asked for his library card or whatever badge gets you into the library.  And he's like, I don't have it on me.  And it was almost the same situation.  They're like, you're going to have to leave.  And he's just like, I go to school here.  I paid for the right to be here.  And he got tased, man.  And of course, every cell phone, camera in the joint.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Shoot it.  I can't get enough of those videos.  The last thing I'm thinking is, why are they getting tased?  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't want the lead up.  I just want that... 
[00:43:30]  You just want to hear the sick click.  And he's trying to click.  Yeah, that clicking and the streak of agony.  And the attitude adjustment.  F-U-A!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, they're instantly compliant.  Yeah.  We got to take a quick break.  We got Kevin Smith doing the whole show with us today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm here all day.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Kevin Smith in studio all morning long. 
[00:44:00]  Just kind of shooting the S.  Totally.  We got to...  What is the S?  Yeah, what's the S word?  I'm tired of the initials.  Shooting scene, man.  Yeah.  Shooting this system, if you're Anthony.  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  Couldn't think of a better computer word with S.  Were you a little worried about the story that Anthony told this morning there, Jimmy?  Well, I was more annoyed that I had a computer story and then he shot his and I was like, 
[00:44:30]  all right, well, I just couldn't figure it out.  Well, up until the shooting point, our stories were very similar.  Yeah.  We had some equipment, some hardware that the computer wasn't recognizing.  You kind of wrecked the whole show today, by the way.  I'm sorry.  See, you know better.  You got to start off slow and then that's the big story for the show.  I was very aggravated.  I had a nice riff on Kid Nation I wanted to do.  Did you watch it?  Yeah, it made me laugh hard.  It's Survivor for little kids.  It seems just like televised child abuse is what it is. 
[00:45:00]  Remember when we were kids and the cartoon, you know, the cartoons and stuff was cool,  but then they decided to make the cartoon characters into kids.  Right.  And that was kind of cool.  That's how, Kid Nation is Survivor for little kids.  Oh, like the Archies?  Yeah, baby Archies.  Where they made the Archie kids.  Muppets to Muppet Babies.  Muppet Babies.  Yeah.  It's the whole feel of Survivor, but it's done with, the kids are between eight.  Eight!  And 15.  So all you get are kids crying. 
[00:45:30]  Like in Survivor, it's like, you know, oh God, they get mad and they're disappointed  that they didn't win the challenge.  With this, you just get kids crying.  CBS knows they have a hit on their hands because they replayed the first episode over the weekend  and I finally got to see it.  And it's two hours of kids crying from mommy.  That's fantastic.  You want to gather a bunch of individuals who have low self-esteem and no identity yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And berate them until they cry.  And throw them together in a Lord of the Flies atmosphere. 
[00:46:00]  They leave them raw materials and like a little cookbook.  So they're trying to figure out how to cook pasta.  And they're like, no, you just throw the pasta in before the water boils.  So they're eating pasta the first night.  It's just all crunchy.  It's just a brick of pasta.  As somebody I know knows somebody that works on the show and they said that the kids, when  they talk to the kids, they're like, I really hope I win this because my brother needs an  operation.  Oh, no. 
[00:46:30]  You know, dad's out of work.  Like heartbreaking stories.  Yeah.  Heartbreaking stories.  That's probably why the parents ship them off to this thing is so they could get a little  cash.  Burn off this kid.  You win.  You have to win for the family.  Not too much pressure.  And don't they give them like a real gold star?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The girl, Sophia, she won the first gold star.  It's worth like $20,000.  I have a connection to Sophia, who's the star of Kid Nation.  It's one of my niece's best friends from Florida. 
[00:47:00]  I thought it was your fiance.  Now that she won the gold star.  But my niece was up recently from Florida and said, my best friend, all of a sudden,  out of nowhere, Sophia is going to be gone for four months.  And she wasn't allowed to talk about where she was going, but she went to film Kid Nation.  So I have a little connection to this show.  But man, we're trying to get the clips because the kid's crying.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, we've got to pull some clips off of that.  It is so funny.  This one eight-year-old's just like, I'm too young for this. 
[00:47:30]  I just need to go home.  I want my mommy.  You want to talk about a bunch of kids who are self-aware real quick?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm too young for this?  I'm too young.  Yes, you are.  Yeah.  Your parents are cruel and hateful.  Get out of Kid Nation.  Hey, we've got a Taze clip where the guy changed his tune.  You guys were mentioning that before the break.  Oh, yeah.  I think we got one.  Is this the library guy or another one?  350 pounds.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the head for that.  Wow.  Okay.  Because who brought it up?  They said, you know, you got the attitude and then you get hit with that thing within 
[00:48:00]  not even a second.  Oh, yeah.  You're done.  I mentioned that.  Jimmy mentioned that.  And all of a sudden, you just behave instantly.  Here it is.  Relax.  Mike.  Black man.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  Probe in here in a second.  You are under arrest.  Do you understand?  For what?  Failing to stop when signaled by the police.  Stop.  Do you understand?  You're under arrest.  Index.  Do it.  Go.  Oh.  Okay. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Get on your stomach.  Get on your stomach.  Give it to him again.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  Put your arms out.  Oh, my.  Put your arms out.  Okay.  Okay.  You got to do it again?  Again.  I'm sorry, man.  Go fight, Mike.  Sorry.  You lost your hand.  He's apologizing for being tased.  All right.  Look.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:49:00]  Anything.  Please.  That was such an about face.  Oh, yeah.  I can't help but think a lot of these cops really get off on hitting him the second time.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Hit him again.  Hit him again.  Who's the guy saying hit him again?  Another cop?  Yeah.  Like, why would you need to hit him again at that point?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  We have a couple of tasers here.  Which one?  That's the same one.  Yeah.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  All right.  What about this guy?  That's it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[00:49:30]  Stop.  No.  No.  No.  Because you just anticipated.  No.  No.  No.  No.  How did we invent this?  This is like modern day torture equipment.  It's like the rack.  Like, that's probably the same sound people made when they were being put in the rack.  And you start cranking it.  No.  No.  Law enforcement's always thinking, man.  Yeah.  They took a few of their other weapons away, so they come up with some new ones.  We need some non-lethal.  We need something non-lethal, but also... 
[00:50:00]  But effective.  Yeah.  Humiliating and really terrifying.  And people will just completely do it about face.  Have you ever felt anything close to it?  Anyone ever do the change?  No.  No.  I know every cop's got to kind of do it.  Pretty much that was the rule a while ago.  Do you mess or something now?  Do you lose control of your bodily functions?  I don't know if every time.  I'm sure if you had to really go bad, you probably would.  Oh, I would.  I would lose it if they pulled it out.  Without even using it or threatening me with it. 
[00:50:30]  If I saw it in his holster and he pulled me over, I would just lose it.  Especially after hearing a 350-pound man go, okay, okay, okay.  Yeah.  Don't make me tase you.  Oh, officer.  I'm sorry.  Can you continue to date somebody after you've seen them?  Oh, I know.  That's just...  Can you have any friends over to watch the game without just, you know...  I thought you were pretty metal, man, until they tased you. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, we're getting some requests here now.  James in New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You've got to play the girl that's singing and gets tased for Kevin.  That one is fantastic.  Which one is that?  Iraq will find it.  She's doing karaoke, and they hit her right in the middle.  Oh, that was a huge video on YouTube and Break.com, right?  This wasn't a cop, right?  This was like one of her buddies.  I think this is Sweet Home Alabama.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  She's singing.  All right, we got it.  Some smart-ass dick decides to tase her in the middle of her singing.  Well, another person trying to make their YouTube video.  What?  It was her boyfriend.  Boyfriend.  Oh.  He tased her while she was singing?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is one of the most viewed videos, I believe, on Break.com.  Check this out, Kevin.  Great home.  Great home.  Great home.  Great home.  Great home.  Let it shine off the blue.  What are you doing?  Boy, did she squeal.  How long did that relationship last?  Not long, no. 
[00:52:00]  What kind of relationship do you have where you think, I can do this and we'll be okay  after this?  Totally.  Well.  How do I make up for this?  I'm sorry.  I just thought it'd be real funny.  I did tase a girlfriend.  I did.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Because I built one at Radio Shack.  I had a schematic and I soldered it together and everything and it didn't arc between the  contacts.  Right.  So, I didn't think it worked.  So, I checked it, you know, the volt meter and everything and it seemed to work, but I 
[00:52:30]  had to test it.  So, I just kind of put it on my girlfriend's leg as she was sitting there.  This is years ago.  Obviously, I don't go out with her anymore.  And push the button real quick and, ooh, it worked.  She was crying for days.  Oh, and she would just not let it go.  No?  No.  I have a similar story in which I put something on a girlfriend's leg, but not quite the same.  Not quite the taser.  But she was equally as mad.  Some sort of release, but yeah, she was pretty ticked and refused to be with me anymore. 
[00:53:00]  By the way, just a little more info.  The guy that got tase at the Curry event, he was definitely trying to make a YouTube video.  He has a website full of pranks, the Andrew Meyer, it's andrewmeyer.com.  So, you know, he wasn't really there to...  Do you think that dude is like, oh, I'm done with this?  Yeah.  After that, it's like, all right, my pranking days are over.  He's got the hit video now.  He's very happy.  We're still talking about it.  It's over a week old now.  I can't imagine that dude doesn't try to sue somehow.  Yeah.  Yeah, he even said, like, the cops were right to do whatever they were, were right to do 
[00:53:30]  what they did.  He said that.  Really?  Yeah.  Claim some sort of culpability?  Yeah.  And then he was telling people...  Like, don't say that.  No, never say that.  Just immediately sue.  Hey, let's go to Jessica in Jersey.  Jessica.  Yeah?  What's up, Jessica?  Jessica, you're on the show.  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  I listen to you guys every morning.  You freaking rock.  Oh, thank you.  Kill.  We got Kevin Smith in today, by the way.  Yeah, sweet.  How are you?  Good morning.  How are you?  Good.  You know, who gives, like, 2.5 taser guns? 
[00:54:00]  Like, that's what I don't understand.  Like, Rent-A-Cops, 5.0, 2.5.  Who gives them?  5.0.  Oh, they call them 2.5.  Yeah, I'm thinking, all right, 5.0, a 2.5.  A 2.5.  I know.  I figured I should explain a little bit.  But, like, who honestly gives them taser guns?  Like, those are the kids who get picked on in high school, and then people actually give  them a taser gun?  Like, I just don't understand this.  This society is ridiculous nowadays.  You just think it's insane that the cops are allowed to do this, huh? 
[00:54:30]  Or security guards.  That's just disgusting.  I mean, like...  Oh, man.  In the old days, that was bullets, though.  I mean, we've come a long way.  That is true.  We're not allowed to voice our opinion anymore, and, like, you know, we bother the politicians,  so we're allowed to get tased.  But what about the frickin' politicians who are bothering us, like, every other day?  Like, I want to see one of them get tased.  Yeah, man.  It's not that extreme, Miss.  You're allowed to express political dissent.  Get a hold of yourself, would you?  Settle down.  All right?  Settle down.  Relax.  Stop trying to stand in front of a tank and have a moment. 
[00:55:00]  Give yourself a break.  Let's go to Jason and Rye.  Simmer down.  Simmer down a bit.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if you heard about the latest military weapon, which is the pain gun.  Oh, what's the pain gun?  That's when they just put it on Front Street.  They're like, what should we call it?  I don't know.  The pain gun.  The pain gun.  We're going to call it the pain gun.  What does it do, sir?  It's specifically tuned to the nerve endings of humans to just cause pain, and they just flee.  Wait, it hits you. 
[00:55:30]  Is it a bullet, or what is it?  It's microwaves.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Microwaves.  Sounds like Tesla's death ray.  The death ray.  Tesla, everyone knows him for the funny little electric coil that makes your hair stand up.  But he had some wacky inventions.  Everybody.  I just know the band.  I know.  I never heard of Tesla.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He acts like it's Einstein or somebody we don't talk about.  Tesla's the guy who created the Tesla coil.  Yeah, the Tesla coil where the kid's in school.  If you watch the old Frankenstein movie where the electrical charge goes up, without Tesla, 
[00:56:00]  they wouldn't have had that of fun.  Yeah, but I call it the electrical-looking light that goes up.  No one knows it's the Tesla coil.  That's not nearly as marketable name as the pain gun.  The pain gun.  Isn't every gun a pain gun gun?  Yeah, pretty much.  Aren't they all kind of tuned to hit your nerve endings?  The word gun in itself pretty much means there will be pain involved if it's pointed at you  and the trigger is pulled.  I can't imagine receiving an electrical charge.  Like, I remember, I don't know if it's still in vogue. 
[00:56:30]  Do kids still do it?  Like, when you wanted to test an old 9-volt battery, see if it was good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Put it on your tongue.  On your tongue.  And it had this weird quote-unquote taste.  But really, that was a small electrical charge.  It was a shock going through your tongue.  It was going through your tongue.  Just screwing what your taste was.  If it was painful and weird, I can't imagine what it would be like to be hit with something.  And I don't ever want to know.  No.  That's why.  Just comply.  Hey, we were speaking about YouTube videos.  Can we say, it's so frustrating, man. 
[00:57:00]  You just figure it out.  Man relieves himself.  Yes?  Yeah.  Okay.  Give it a shot.  Had to change the word there.  Man relieves himself on dying woman, declaring it YouTube material.  Oh.  We were just discussing.  Oh, my God.  What?  They dumped out of that?  Yeah, they ain't going to do that.  Well.  Because it's what you're doing.  Was it a news story?  It's what you're doing.  Remember, you can talk about things, certain things.  You just can't talk about what it's doing, where it's going. 
[00:57:30]  But these rules are ridiculous.  Little kids talk.  This is the first thing kids talk about, is this type of stuff.  There was a woman.  That's a news story.  And it's a news story, too.  A woman collapsed in the street.  Right.  This gentleman decided it would be a good idea for a YouTube video to do something to her  that you would normally do standing up after you've had many beers at a bar. 
[00:58:00]  See how we have to explain stuff?  That pretty much explains it in a way.  That is more confusing to me.  Of course it is.  Of course.  And supposedly it's to protect the children.  But this is the first thing kids talk about, is this type of stuff.  I know.  Well, they finally realized...  No kids listen to the show, because they're all busy at work at Kid Nation.  Right.  Trying to earn a gold star.  To save the family.  Well, those children aren't protected, but they're protecting them from hearing the story.  It's just ridiculous.  But getting to the meat of that story, if anyone followed what that was at all. 
[00:58:30]  Exactly.  Is that like an AP or a wire service story?  Oh yeah.  This is a biggie today.  Shouting, this is YouTube material, a 27-year-old British man blanked on a dying woman who had  collapsed on the street.  The BBC and local Hartapool male and Northern Echo tell us, he also doused her with a bucket  of water and covered her with shaving cream.  The woman, 50-year-old Christine Lakinski, died at the scene of pancreatic failure. 
[00:59:00]  She died at the scene of that?  In a sad sign of the times...  What a way to go, to have all that stuff on you, and go, wow, this is my final moment?  Right.  In a sad sign of the times, it was all recorded on a mobile phone.  In court, Anthony Anderson said he had smoked a joint and been drinking with two friends  when they spotted Lakinski.  He faces jail after pleading guilty to outraging public decency. 
[00:59:30]  Damn!  In court, his defense was, but I'm Benny Hill.  This is how I make my living.  Put the Benny Hill music to it.  I was slapping an old guy on his bald head.  Can I ask you, I understand where he got some of the stuff he put on her, but where did  he get the shaving cream and the bucket?  When there's a dying woman, where do you get shaving cream and a bucket of water?  Spur of the moment.  How do you have that handy?  Hang on, ma'am.  Hang on.  I'll be right back.  Don't die yet. 
[01:00:00]  And she's thinking, help's coming.  There it is.  Now it's just funny.  An angel with acne written on it.  He drops it on her head.  Which sounds...  He needs some of those.  What do you think before somebody just shoots...  Well, this sounds like somebody's shooting a death.  Yeah.  But just a flat...  Just even worse, like a murder and putting it on YouTube going like, I wanted to get a  high hip count.  Yeah.  I wanted to beat the Britney guy.  Right.  Leave Britney alone. 
[01:00:30]  I spent an entire evening watching nothing but, like, convenience store surveillance camera  video.  Well, that's much better than hanging out in your basement.  Well, it was very entertaining.  And there are some people that can take a taser, which amazes me.  There was a guy that shot him right in the chest area and zapped him.  He got a jolt, but never got off his feet, ripped the things right out of his chest, and  then just started coming after the cops.  And then you get to see people just get shot and killed, which is kind of odd in this day 
[01:01:00]  and age.  Where are you seeing this stuff?  Break.com.  YouTube's got a lot of robbery things, people.  There's one that...  And there's some that are funny.  There's this one guy who's trying to break into a liquor store that's just hysterical.  He's falling down trying to climb the fence, and then he's trying to come through the  ceiling tiles, and all you see is surveillance view, so you don't see the actual ceiling,  but you see some stuff falling.  And then he just...  The tiles in him hit a big rack of booze, and he just falls on the floor, and then he 
[01:01:30]  can't get out.  He's trying to break the front window, and he can't get out, so he just decides to sit  out on a box and smoke a cigarette until the cops come.  He just gave up.  He tried to climb out with another ladder and just fell on another rack of booze.  How great is that?  How great is that?  He took a hand truck, and he was ramming it into this window that would not break.  Wow.  Just wouldn't break.  What a weakling.  So he sat down here and just smoked the cigarette, and the cops came.  No, it's ridiculous.  YouTube will have no problem with those, but if you do something a little sexy... 
[01:02:00]  Sexual, they don't like at all.  Then they lose their minds.  Don't show boobies.  Our society's just ridiculous.  You know, I think more so, they know that they can get away with that.  Yeah, there's the guy falling.  A few ceiling tiles fall, and then he just comes tumbling down on top of the booze.  That's really funny.  Someone's saying you screwed up, Professor Anthony.  What did I do?  It's very rare when Anthony screws up.  Oh, my God.  But you guys got to forgive him.  He had a wild weekend shooting guns and driving 125 miles an hour all over Long Island. 
[01:02:30]  What did I do?  Did he improperly define the Tesla coil?  I'm hoping.  Matt, what's up?  What did I do?  Yeah, Anthony, if you were to grab a Tesla coil, I'm pretty sure more than just your  hair standing up would happen to you.  That's the DeGrasse generator?  Yeah.  You said it was a Tesla coil.  That's the thing that they had in the Frankenstein movie.  Oh, right, right.  Which is the one that is the round?  I thought they were both the same, to tell you the truth. 
[01:03:00]  No, it's called the Van de Graaff generator.  It's the round ball.  It generates that.  Oh, it makes the kids in school, their hair stand up.  That's what I was thinking of.  Yeah, me and Jimmy were thinking the same thing, man.  But I correctly identified the Tesla coil as the Frankenstein movie prop.  Yes, right.  I recognize the movie.  Points for me.  I've seen that.  And Tesla was in The Prestige.  He was a kid played by David Bowie.  David Bowie.  That movie was really good.  It was actually a pretty watchful flick.  I like that one.  All right, Matt.  Is this guy sorry that he did this to this woman, by the way? 
[01:03:30]  It's like, he should just be shot.  They should just shoot him in court.  All right.  Well, we can film that video.  That'll be make a good YouTube video.  Before we take a break, Ty in Georgia.  What's up, Ty?  Yeah, I picked up a car battery one time, and I've been working on a car.  I was all sweaty, and both the terminals hit my chest at the same time while I was wet.  That shit will knock you right on the ground.  Hey, hey, hey, with the S word.  Hey.  Putty mouth. 
[01:04:00]  So what happened to this guy?  He picked up a battery with sweaty hands, and it knocked you right on the ground?  Oh, yeah.  It's a lot worse than a little nine volts on the tongue, that's for sure.  I mean, it took me right on the ground.  It's the salt in your sweat.  Well, it depends how long you hold the nine volts on your tongue, sir.  Let's be fair.  If you just tap it.  That is a weird feeling.  Every kid's done it, though.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, dude, do that.  But do you think, like, I've never told my kid to do that, but when I was a kid, I was  told to do that, to test a battery.  That's one of those things they just don't tell kids anymore, because they're like, it's  wrong.  Don't do it.  It's just bad. 
[01:04:30]  It'll hurt them.  But when I was a child, you had to do that in order to see if the battery was any good.  Yep.  All right.  We got to take a break.  When we get back.  Things like that.  And sorry.  The Indian sunburn.  Remember that one?  Where you just grab someone's wrist and twist in opposite directions with that?  You don't see that anymore.  No, but they don't do that.  What do they do these days?  Instead, they take shaving cream to a dying woman.  Yeah.  Is that it?  All right.  That's all the rage for kids these days.  They up to Annie a little bit.  Now they just go on YouTube and kind of do some stuff, but to your buddies, like, what 
[01:05:00]  do you do?  Hey, Cruel Circus from Long Island.  No, Kevin is still wrong.  The Frankenstein thing isn't a Tesla coil.  It's a Jacob's Ladder.  What?  Wow.  I don't know.  I stand corrected.  These people.  Hey, when we get back, we got to talk about the Iranian president.  He's in New York City.  Yep.  Thank God.  A mere few miles from where we're broadcasting from.  Oh, I couldn't be happier.  He prevented me from getting a good hotel room in the city.  Yep.  Well, we'll talk about that.  We'll talk about the traffic.  And it'll be a nice 18-hour drive home. 
[01:05:30]  He personally prevented me from getting a nice hotel room.  Personally.  He's standing at the front counter going, not this guy.  We'll get into that after the break.  And of course, we have to talk about Marcia and Jan Brady.  Big story.  Big story of the day.  Big story of the day.  Lesbo.  And Kevin Smith's book, which comes out tomorrow, My Boring-Ass Life, The Uncomfortably  Candid Diary of Kevin Smith, is a nice, fat, already soft-cover book.  Very easy thing to bring on a plane.  Yes.  See you, man.  I don't even know if it's that easy to bring on a plane.  But it will definitely stop a bullet.  Well, it might not make the weight. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, this is a big book.  A lot of nonsense.  It's going to have in your jacket.  If somebody's racing at you to tase you, have a copy of it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It'll protect you.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Kevin Smith in studio.  Trying to tell Jimmy that he might have an earwig in his ear.  It was just an option.  I wasn't saying that's what it was.  But at least he had an itch in his ear.  I have a little itch that keeps coming back to my ear.  So I'm thinking I have a tumor in my brain.  Captain Kirk.  I want to thank.  They put creatures in our bodies. 
[01:06:30]  I want to thank.  I want to thank Kevin Smith for all the phone calls we're going to get later today.  You don't think I really have an earwig, do you?  You think Kevin was just saying that for the show?  I'm an earwig.  No, Jimmy.  You don't have an earwig.  Mike, at that point.  It wraps itself around the cerebral cortex.  Go into an ears, nose, throat guy, get candling done.  I stick the cone in your ear.  They light the cone on fire.  And it clears wax out of your ear.  I heard that was a scam.  Really?  This dude showed me a glob of wax came out of my head where I was like.  That's what I heard, but I hear it because it's waxed like the paper itself is coated with wax. 
[01:07:00]  So when you light it.  I tasted it.  It tasted like my earwax.  Earwax?  Oh, okay.  Then it's a chew.  I was like, that's a lot.  He gave it a chew.  It tastes like peanut butter.  Between the cheek and gum.  It's got to taste like peanut butter for your wax.  Yeah, candling supposedly like, yeah.  Yeah.  A scam.  I believe in candling.  I believe in leeches.  No.  Leeches are good.  Candling, I don't know.  I saw results.  Anything that produces results, I tend to believe.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:07:30]  Let's go to Oscar in Jersey.  Oscar, what's up?  Hey, Ope.  Early in the morning, you said you saw Into the Wild.  How was it?  Yeah, we're lucky here in New York City.  They had a few screenings.  I think the movie comes out October 4th or 5th.  Somewhere around.  Into the Wild?  Into the Wild.  I loved it, man.  Did you read the book, Ope?  Absolutely.  I read the book about 10 years ago.  What, 12 years ago?  Something like that?  Yeah, man.  The book was great.  I just can't wait to see the movie.  You know, I was telling Kevin Smith, like, a lot of movies aren't as good as the book.  Yep.  It becomes something maybe different or whatever.  I mean, this stays true to the book, and I enjoyed it just as much as the book, if not better. 
[01:08:00]  Did they show him paddling through Mexico?  You know, in the book, they're talking, when he's in Mexico, paddling through, like, all this shit canal.  Whoa, hey, hey.  People love that word.  It's such a good word.  They really ought to legalize that word or whatever it is.  Just desensitize it because everyone uses it.  Everyone uses it.  Yeah, it just makes the word have power.  It's nothing sexual.  No.  It's just a fun word.  The opposite of sexual.  Yeah, it shows him paddling and whitewater rafting, all that stuff.  The star of the movie, he lost 41 pounds for the big scene at the end. 
[01:08:30]  You're going to have to, excuse my ignorance, what is it about?  Into the Wild?  Yeah, never read the book.  It was a kid that kind of sort of came from a broken family.  They definitely hinted at that more in the movie and decided, he was a really smart kid,  decided he just wanted to take off.  And he started backpacking for two straight years.  And they swear he wasn't nuts.  He burned his IDs.  He had like $24,000 he left to charity.  And what year does this take place?  92, 94, somewhere in there. 
[01:09:00]  Yep.  I was going to say, if it was 1850, it wouldn't have been that spectacular.  Right.  And then he ate somebody and stayed alive.  We're at the Donner Party.  He pretty much disappeared and was backpacking for two straight years.  And he wanted to go to the wilderness in Alaska, the ultimate adventure.  And he ended up dying up there.  Oh, you ruined the ending.  How did they go into about him dying?  Did they follow what the book said about eating the...  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But supposedly some info has come...  Spoilers.  Nah, I mean...  That's how it ends. 
[01:09:30]  Spoiling Nellie's.  He just flat out dies.  It's actually how it begins.  And then it's very slow.  Some dudes there with shaving cream.  YouTubing it.  I don't feel bad giving the ending of this away because...  Because it's a book.  It's a book and everyone knows the book.  A lot of people read this book.  And I guess some info has come out since...  What's his name?  Wrote that book that it might have been mold on the seeds and that he actually ate the right  berry.  Oh, see?  I didn't tell you that he died by eating a poisoned berry or something.  Well...  Oh, he definitely dies in a truck.  Oh, wow. 
[01:10:00]  Actually, a bus.  In a truck.  Wait, wait.  Were these...  Geez, you're spoiling everything.  Were these crunch berries?  Yeah.  Because if not, then I have no fear that I will ever eat these poisoned berries.  The guy would never.  Only berry I eat.  Only berries I eat.  Crunch berry.  Cap'n Crunch.  The book basically talks about how he was very experienced and he knew what to eat from  the land.  And he made a crucial mistake where he ate this one berry thinking it was okay for you,  but it actually was very similar to another berry that's poisonous.  But the author was on Oprah. 
[01:10:30]  Don't ask.  I saw Into the Wild, so I'm like, I got to watch some Into the Wild stuff.  So the author came on and he goes, he found out after he wrote the book that actually  the seeds might have been okay and they were moldy and that caused what happened to him.  The problem is he ate the berry from the dingle tree.  You know what that'll do.  You know what this berry did, though?  It shut down his digestive system so he couldn't digest food anymore and he starved to death.  And then hundreds of them found him like three days after he died.  But do you still...  Hunters found him.  Do you still void?  You could still try to eat, but it does nothing for you. 
[01:11:00]  So you're eating, but is it still going through your system?  It's just not draining any nutrition out of it, or is it sitting in your...  Good question.  I'm looking for the...  I don't know.  Is this why I'm so fat?  Did I eat a bad berry and that's why I just can't lose weight?  Maybe it's a moldy crunch berry.  My friend's actually in that movie, Into the Void.  Seriously?  Yeah, Into the Wild.  Steve Wigg.  He's Lars' assistant.  He's a small party.  He plays like a ranger.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, there was a ranger...  Well, I won't give that part away.  Oh, yeah.  Don't ruin the movie.  I told you everything that happens up to the credits. 
[01:11:30]  I don't want to tell you anything else.  But Into the Wild was a huge bookend.  I thought everyone knew.  And like me and my girlfriend, fiance, are going to the movie.  Fiance.  And I tell her, yeah, the guy dies at the end.  She was really mad at me.  But then by the end of the movie, it didn't matter.  Hold on.  That was a quick correct.  Did you get a yelling at for something at one point?  No, no.  You better start calling me your fiance.  No, I'm just starting to get used to...  Girlfriend, fiance.  I'm just used to saying girlfriend for so long.  She's still your girlfriend, dude.  Yeah, I know.  And I like saying girlfriend better because it sounds like more natural. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  Fiance is too fancy and too like fake sounding.  It sounds queer.  Yeah.  Fiance.  It's a little foo-foo.  Now, Into the Wild is going to be massively huge.  It was filmed beautifully.  The music, and it's going to kill Anthony because he doesn't like this dude.  But Eddie Vedder did an amazing job with the music.  I like Eddie Vedder.  I just make fun of him a lot.  Do you really like him?  But he doesn't sound like that anymore.  Oh, he doesn't?  He's really evolved.  The music in Into the Wild is amazing.  I can't wait to pick up the soundtrack. 
[01:12:30]  Who stars in it as like a big celebrity?  Emile Rowland's here.  Emile Hirsch.  Thank you.  He's the kid that's going to play Speed Racer.  Oh, right.  He's shooting Speed Racer.  That probably doesn't help you.  He was in The Girl Next Door.  You never saw that?  That wouldn't help him either.  He was in, most recently, did you see a movie called Alpha Dog?  Oh.  Watch Alpha Dog.  It was actually a pretty good watch.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I enjoyed it.  Yeah, he was really, really good in this film.  Thanks, Oscar.  All right, later.  Who directed?  You didn't say. 
[01:13:00]  Sean Penn.  Sean Penn.  Right?  Right on.  Spicoli made a movie.  I wasn't sure if he was the producer or the director.  I think he's the director.  Sean Penn's an ass.  We were talking about this off mic.  He's brilliant and all that, blah, blah, blah.  But he was Spicoli.  He's got to chill out.  On Oprah, he was so over-the-top serious about everything.  The guy, like everyone else is laughing in the studio because they're making a few jokes  here and there, you know, having a good time.  He won't allow himself to laugh.  And he won't allow himself to laugh.  He's like, dude, loosen up.  Just loosen up that you-know-what.  He's pretty earnest, man.  Would you see the way he handled the South Park incident? 
[01:13:30]  I'm glad that Matt and Trey think it's a pro.  Shut your face.  Yeah.  He couldn't just even talk normally.  He's just one of those guys.  He's a brilliant actor.  And as a person, he's a horrible dullard.  Academy Awards.  What was it, two years ago, three years ago, Chris Rock got up and was making jokes  about, like, you know, there are movie stars and then there are people who are in movies  and he was just like, you want somebody famous, I forget who it was, you can't get him, you  get Jude Law. 
[01:14:00]  Right, right, right.  And then Sean Penn, like, you know, it was a good bit.  And he's like, who is Jude Law?  That was the thing, Chris.  Who is Jude Law?  Right.  And then Sean Penn gets up 20 minutes later and it's like, I would just like to say Jude  Law is one of our most treasured actors.  Yeah, yeah.  Where it's just like, dude, he was joking or it's Chris Rock, dude.  He couldn't even identify it as a joke.  He had to.  And you're sitting there going like, this was Spicoli, man.  Yeah, right.  This is this guy.  Hey, bud.  Yes. 
[01:14:30]  Let's party.  He hit himself in the head with a van.  Listen, listen up.  There it is.  What about that?  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  He doesn't want to even acknowledge you made that film, but that was the reason why we're  still watching Sean Penn movies to this day.  Yeah.  If he didn't make that one, who knows if he ever would have been.  It went from that to like Taps.  Well, I was good.  Which one was he in first?  Was he in Fast Times or Taps first?  Fast Times.  You got to.  No, I believe Taps.  Seriously?  I'm pretty sure it is Taps.  It's actually. 
[01:15:00]  When Timothy Hutton was.  I think.  I don't know if that was after Ordinary People, but Timothy Hutton starred in Taps.  I think that was before.  Wait, wait, wait.  You had it.  Let's see.  It's a matter of E-Rock.  I saw it.  Go all the way down.  E-Rock.  It was one of his first movies.  Yeah, go to the bottom of his actor list.  I think Taps was before.  I'm with you on this one.  I think it was Taps before.  Wow.  None of them were famous, except I think Hutton was the big name.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was.  Tom Cruise wasn't famous at all.  No, he was nobody.  He had a small little teeny.  All right, here we go.  Wow, you're right. 
[01:15:30]  Taps, 1981, and then Fast Times, 82.  Did he have a bit.  I'm going to sound ignorant or whatever, but did he have a big role in Taps?  I don't even know.  Yeah, no.  He was essentially.  He was the other guy.  Sidekick.  Yeah, he was Tim Hutton's sidekick.  I mean, I wouldn't go so far as to call him second lead, but he was pretty way up there.  Yeah, it was more after Timothy Hutton.  It was more ensemble, like, after him.  Hold on.  That movie has an awesome line. 
[01:16:00]  You like Taps?  Yeah, there's one.  Where Sean Penn gets real loud with Tim Hutton.  He's just like, you're just talking about the George C. Scott character, whose name I  forget.  Do you remember the name?  Lieutenant Baish.  Baish.  He's going, you just want to have Baish's memory to yourself because you love him.  You just want to be snug as two bugs, queer for each other.  Such a great line, man.  It looks good.  And that's when he hits him, like Tim Hutton, the halls of the oven hits him.  I remember the father said this, too, because Tim Hutton was his son and the father was  a military man.  He goes, General Baish is living proof that horses' asses aren't only on horses. 
[01:16:30]  And back at that, like in 81, I was like, that's cool.  But now I'm like, that's a little tight.  And as mentioned way earlier in the show, one of the best lines in the whole movie is,  it's beautiful, man.  It's beautiful, man.  Tom Cruise.  We're just shooting.  It's a good movie.  We've got to go backwards for a second here.  Jason and Philly, go ahead.  Hey, yeah.  If you've got to spoil the book or movie, you've got to spoil it correctly.  Go ahead.  It's the stalks from the potato plant.  It actually lined his lower intestine, and then he couldn't absorb the nutrients.  That's what I said.  Yeah, but it wasn't a berry. 
[01:17:00]  It was the stalks from the potato plant.  He's got you there.  He had seeds from.  The potato is not a berry.  I heard it was seeds, my friend.  I heard it was a Tesla coil.  It was a giant lightning bolt.  Right.  All right, Jason.  All I know is there's no chance that I will ever die that way, because I will not go into  the wild.  Do any of you guys have that yen to go out?  No.  Or your yen to go out there?  I have no interest whatsoever.  Is it camping, stuff like that?  Not into it. 
[01:17:30]  Really?  I need creature comforts.  I definitely like going on some hikes.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  I don't like hiking.  I don't like any of that crap.  Give me a nice hotel.  The nature exists, but I just like to see it on TV.  I like seeing it on the high-def channels.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Totally.  It's like you're there.  With a refrigerator nearby and all the good stuff.  I want to talk about the Iranian president, but we got Marge standing by.  Oh, my God.  Marge from the Little Shelter.  There's this place out in Long Island.  It's called the Little Shelter.  It's like it plays second fiddle to the North Shore Animal League on Long Island. 
[01:18:00]  So it's for pets.  Yeah.  For animals.  Yeah, it's for animals.  Slaughterhouse, basically.  Oh, yeah.  It's just a slaughterhouse.  Marge calls all the time and tries to get us to help out.  She just fails miserably.  The place is constantly broke, if you listen to her.  Constantly in need of money and repairs and everything.  It's been there forever.  My school bus used to pass the little shelter when I went to elementary school. 
[01:18:30]  That's how long ago it was.  Yeah.  That was many years before guns and...  Oh, Schindler was saving animals from it when I was going...  This pin could have saved nine dogs.  Nine dogs.  Well, Marge has a new cause.  Maybe central to the dog effort.  Right.  The last cause was she had a Viagra dog.  She wanted our audience to send Viagra illegally in the mail because this dog had a heart problem.  Yeah, and Viagra helped the dog's heart. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Marge.  Marge.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hey, how's Viagra dog?  Dead?  No.  Ingrid is still there.  Ingrid.  She's doing beautifully, but she does need a good home.  And I have to tell you, we're getting emails from some of your listeners that are so heartwarming.  Oh.  I thought she was going to say horrible.  People out there.  And they're trying to help us. 
[01:19:30]  And one of the emails didn't believe that I'm a real person.  They think that I'm a setup for your show.  So set the record straight on that.  What, that you are a setup for the show?  That I'm not a setup.  No, you are real.  No, you're an actress.  You do exist.  You're an actress that we hire to call our show once a month.  No, no, no, no, no.  You know, an old actress out of work, we figure, what the hell, it's worth a few bucks.  It gets the people reacting out there.  So, yeah, I guess we can finally admit that you're not real. 
[01:20:00]  You're the original Alice on The Honeymooners.  All right.  The original Alice.  Less than one show.  Believe me, I know you want to make fun of everything.  I say.  But in this particular case, if you just listen for two seconds.  What do you want?  A couple of months ago, this guy, very good-looking guy, by the way, came into the shelter and gave  us a check for $1,000.  He's the owner of Chateau La Mer in Lyndonhurst.  His name is George. 
[01:20:30]  And he said, what can I do to help you guys?  He just did.  So, he said, I think what I'm going to do.  I am going to allow you to invite 300 people.  I will pay for everything at La Mer.  I'll pick up the whole tab, and all you have to do is get the people there.  And this is happening on October 26th, which is a Friday night.  And now, wait.  Now, what is the cause?  The North Shore Animal League.  Boring.  That's it. 
[01:21:00]  We need a medical center so bad.  A medical center?  You're not getting a medical center?  Why?  After you gas them, there's nothing that you can do to bring them back.  Well, you need his steps up to the oven.  You need a bigger pet cemetery.  Hello?  What?  What happened?  Many of these little ones are sick.  We have to travel for miles to find a doctor.  It costs us a fortune to pay.  We're traveling all over the world, and it's just impossible. 
[01:21:30]  We need a doctor.  You're traveling all over the world?  Well, that's kind of...  I don't mean it that way.  But in order to find a doctor...  What do you mean you don't mean it that way?  You lied.  What do you mean you don't...  I travel all over the world, do you?  Well, I don't mean it that way.  How else can you mean it?  She goes to Staten Island.  Call your jets.  Oh, my God.  It's Monday, for God's sake.  Slow your roll, sir.  Slow your roll.  That is just an expression.  It doesn't mean that we travel, obviously, all over the world,  but we need to have bets on premises. 
[01:22:00]  You need a sign in front of the place that says,  Arbit Mach Free.  That's what your place is.  It's a concentration camp for cats and dogs.  Let me ask you.  I don't care who answers this question.  This question is for anybody on your show.  All right.  What would you do if you had a dog or cat that you couldn't keep and nobody, nobody would take it? 
[01:22:30]  Let's just pretend that you've had...  I'll tell you.  What would you do?  Release it into the woods.  Right.  Into the wild.  Into the wild.  And hopefully it'll eat some of those berries.  I'd say, like, stay away from the potato stalks and or berries.  Right, right.  I'll tell you what you would do.  Okay.  What would you do?  And die peacefully while Eddie Vedder's music is playing in the background.  You would turn into sobbing people that didn't know where to turn.  You would call up your friends.  Please take Toto. 
[01:23:00]  Please, I beg of you.  I have nowhere to go.  And that's my whole purpose for being...  I hear you, man.  And I'm like, I'm with you.  I love animals as much as the next guy.  But the older I got, the more I realized, like, I should probably give money to children  who are starving.  Right.  Human beings.  If you want to know something, there is room for everything.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're on with Phil from Long Island.  Phil has a problem with Marge.  What's up, Phil?  I have a 15-minute ride from Shoreham to Riverhead for work. 
[01:23:30]  And this woman is killing the only fun I'm going to have.  So, he's not satisfied with what we've chosen for his commute.  All you have to do is adopt a pet, man, and we can get off the subject.  I already have one.  I got a little weeder dog.  It's just that I want to listen to funny stuff.  Phil, Phil, my question of the day is, there are desperate people out there that need to  Let's go to Pat on Long Island.  Pat, you're on with Marge.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  I got a problem with this woman.  Yeah.  Hey, Marge, let me ask you a question.  Okay. 
[01:24:00]  A friend of mine, my neighbor, called your shelter.  Because she had to move to a place where she couldn't take her cat.  And it was three kittens.  And your shelter told her, sorry, I don't think so.  Three kittens, though.  And you called her.  Wait.  May I answer?  The cattery is full.  When do I have the turn to answer?  Oh, okay.  Just say, just say, answer.  Yes, answer no.  Okay.  I answer yes.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  Look at the phones.  I want you to listen to the answer. 
[01:24:30]  Now we've got to keep her off for a couple minutes.  We have.  Just annoy everyone.  We have 350 cats in our cattery.  Yeah.  The cattery.  I must think.  That is more than 10 Long Island shelters put together.  You tell me.  Congrats.  In such a tiny shelter, what we're going to do with another cat and kittens, where can  we put it?  Well, if you didn't call it the little shelter, maybe it would be bigger.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  And you'd be able to fit that.  But you kind of pigeonholed yourself.  Yeah, you should call it the bigger shelter.  The medium-sized shelter, even.  What she really needs is money to be donated for burlap sacks and rocks.  Rocks.  Yeah, they're on the North Shore.  I love cats, too.  But if you've got 350, like, someone's got to go.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Exactly.  It's a sad fact of life.  But there is just no room.  It's not expandable.  We have as many cats as we can have. 
[01:25:30]  When there is no more room in hell, the cats will walk the earth.  Opie and Anthony, here's a proposal for you.  A proposal.  Here we go.  We've got a lot of space here, I'm telling you.  Yeah, we could probably fit.  I look around the studio.  I hear the new studio's even bigger.  Be nice.  A lot of cats.  Do you remember I told you the story that the feral cat situation is so terrible that  a guy came out of his driveway and he backed over two cats in his driveway?  Do you remember that story that you find so hysterical? 
[01:26:00]  I mean, God help us.  God help us.  Here's a solution.  Here's a solution.  Yeah.  One of my favorite sounds of the whole show.  Oh, that one's angry.  Yeah.  It's cat shovel baseball, Kevin.  I think after that violent noise, you would not just hear, meow.  That's a very laid back knock.  That's the next one.  Come on. 
[01:26:30]  I'm wondering what's next.  If you don't have full hearts, you've got to have half a heart.  I love animals as much as the next guy.  My old man used to feed.  We were the cat people in town when I was a kid.  We weren't allowed to have pets when we were children.  Then one day we got a cat.  Then we got another cat.  Another cat.  And we had five cats inside.  See?  But outside the house, my old man, every day, like he was retired from the post office, you  know, from stroke disability or whatever.  And he would put together this meal in like a bus bucket of like old meat and really cheap 
[01:27:00]  pet food and bread rinds and old stale bread mixed up with water, hand mix it, you know,  with his own two hands and then be like, open the door.  And I would pull up the back door.  Wow.  And he would bring this large bucket out to the backyard and out of nowhere, 25 cats  would just swing out.  Oh, wow.  And feed from this trough.  And all he did was complain about it.  It was the bane of his desire.  I hate these cats.  I can't stand them.  And it's like, we wouldn't have all these outdoor cats if you would stop feeding them. 
[01:27:30]  And then they all went away, Marge.  We lost them to a storm, the nor'easter of 92.  Ah.  Because we couldn't all get them all into the house.  And for the next week after the waters went down, receded, I had to go find all these  cats in neighbor's yards because they were like, hey, your cat's dead in our yard.  Dead in the yard.  Hey, that's not my cat.  Yeah.  Hey, it's not my job to dispose of them.  But still, I was made to do it.  And I remember the worst one was a cat that was trying to climb up a fence to get away 
[01:28:00]  from the rising tide of water.  And he had two legs through the fence.  And he was falling out of the fence with his mouth.  Mouth closed around the fence.  Oh, those are just the kind that...  Oh, shut your face!  Dead and rigorous.  We're getting some comedy from Kevin Smith.  And this cat was harder than hell, man, to get off the fence.  He was locked onto that thing.  He was locked onto the fence.  There was nothing you could do.  Little guy, I was trying to make it.  Couldn't do it.  Couldn't do it.  That's a sad little story.  Like, looking at me with the expression on his face, like, why didn't you let me in your 
[01:28:30]  house?  Oh, you fed me.  But I was like, hey, buddy, we had, you know, water up to our knees in the house.  He had died anyway.  I was talking to the dead cat, yeah.  Little guy?  Plus, you're feral.  Yeah.  Can I just say something?  One word here.  Yeah.  We are pushing for spaying and neutering so badly.  I hear you.  We are pushing for spaying and neutering.  She was already up to, like, 20 words.  That's another cause that we're very interested in, because there are so many wild cats on  the street.  They just keep on reproducing in front of your eyes. 
[01:29:00]  I never see them.  Yeah, you know.  I don't see any wild cats anywhere.  Not in my neighborhood.  Go to YouTube.  You can watch them reproduce in front of your eyes.  Oh, right in front of your eyes.  Hey, let's go to Sarah in Maine.  We only have a few moments left with March.  Sarah?  Hey, I just wanted to say, Darwin's idea of natural selection, people and animals are  dying every day.  I love animals.  I've got dogs, cats, horses, everything like that.  But they've got to die sometime.  Everything dies.  You can't save every animal.  You can't save every person. 
[01:29:30]  Because if you did, we'd be overruled by them all.  There you go.  It's great.  You know what?  Make a good lieutenant.  Absolutely.  Every animal's got to die sometime, Marge.  I've ever heard in my life.  That's very logical, Marge.  You've just got to hire different people at the shelter that don't have a heart.  And Marge is a crusader.  Right.  You've just got to hire people that can take care of the situation.  You know what?  Guys, you've got to open your eyes to the situation.  Animals are the sweetest, dearest things. 
[01:30:00]  I agree, man.  Animals are great.  Who doesn't love a good animal?  If there's too many, what are you going to do?  Yeah, there's too many.  A lot of people pointing out that we said we were going to talk about Marsha and Jan.  Nah, that's...  And we did have a cat subject, but...  Speaking of animals...  Speaking of...  Yes.  Speaking of blank.  Oh, the stinky cattery.  She teased it for a book she's coming out with, right?  What was her name?  Maureen McCormick?  Yeah, Marsha. 
[01:30:30]  Let's go to that real quick.  Let's get away from the sad fact that animals die every day.  Yeah.  Before break, we've got to let you know about CashForGold.com.

Another crappy week.  What happened?  My brother's football picks.  He was the favorite going into this football season, but we got three out of eight. 
[01:32:00]  No, three out of how many games did we pick?  Seven?  Three out of seven.  And Than, Steve, and Danny got five out of seven.  There's Travis.  Huh?  Travis, how's he doing?  Travis had four, but he's tied for the season lead.  Is he doing double or nothing from last year?  Nothing or nothing?  Oh, he didn't get his money either?  I don't know.  I never got my money.  How did no one get their money?  I don't know. 
[01:32:30]  Because people are, you know, I was going to take my money and throw it out of a helicopter,  and then lawyers got involved, but I said, look, I'm still going to throw the money out somehow.  And I never got my money.  Will did Travis get his money?  Travis, you get me.  Oh, that's Sam.  You get your money?  Travis just thumbs up on his money.  I don't know what happened with my money.  Well, your money was going to be used as a felony, so they probably...  Huh?  Nothing.  Felony?  I don't get it, though.  I'm just going to...  Meaning that you were going to throw it out of a helicopter, which is like sometimes... 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Supposedly, it's legal.  He's explaining it.  Huh?  No, supposedly, he was explaining it.  I had to.  Supposedly, it's legal.  Sometimes when there's a bomb, as you're sweeping up the mess, you can act like it wasn't that bad.  Like, no, no, no, guys.  I meant this in all three years.  Yeah, this is what I meant.  By the way, we don't have much on Marsha and Jan going at it.  It's going to be in an upcoming book, like we were saying before break.  It's in an upcoming book.  Maureen McCormick is writing a book, and she teased it by saying, like, I'm going to reveal  some girl-on-girl with me and Eve Plum.  Yeah.  While they were on the show. 
[01:33:30]  Not like later in life, where they were like drunk and like...  Yeah, one of the reunions.  See what we taste like.  Just like what happened back in the day.  It's kind of hard to think Marsha goes that way, but Eve Plum.  Let me tell you something, though.  I'll be honest with you.  During that Hawaiian episode phase, that would have been fine.  With Eve Plum?  Yeah.  Marsha and Eve Plum experimenting with each other like that in Hawaii.  And the earlier in the series it is, the hotter it is. 
[01:34:00]  That's the rule of thumb.  And then the show where the father walked in and went double yuck.  I believe it was in the same episode when they were trying to build that house of cards.  Yeah, yeah.  When one was 11 and the other was 12.  Watch it.  Easy, Jan.  I saw a bracelet dangled too close to a body part with lots of nerve endings, and one thing  led to another, and they tumbled like lovers.  Didn't that, what's his name?  Greg Brady wrote a book about how he went out with Florence Henderson. 
[01:34:30]  They're coming up with so many stories that you can't watch the old shows anymore and  not think about them.  Because you see when Greg got older and he was driving and stuff, he's kind of giving  Florence Henderson different eyes.  It's a business.  Yeah, kind of looking at her a little different.  Now I'll just watch for Jan and Marsha to be going at it.  Yeah.  With each other.  Lesboing it up.  Yeah, yeah, they come into the room together, and they're in the bedroom. 
[01:35:00]  They've just been tucked into bed.  Oh, she's sneaking out of her bed.  Ah, there you go.  And of course Cindy's left to her own devices.  Dad comes in.  He's not interested in anything that's going on in that room.  Goes into the boys' room.  How do we not know?  How do we not know?  I'm looking at a still from the Hawaiian episode.  And there's Mr. Brady in what would be known as a gay bathing suit.  What is he in Havoc, sir? 
[01:35:30]  There's a hole in the back.  There's a hole in the back.  No straight guy wears a bathing suit like that at the beach.  I don't care what year it is.  Look at that thing, man.  Doesn't it all put a completely different spin, though, on Marsha, Marsha, Marsha?  Yes.  Because she's like, oh, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha, Marsha.  Yelling for her.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Oh.  Slow it down, man.  Yes.  You were cheating on me.  Pimp music.  Well, all I hear all day long at school is how great Marsha is at this, or how wonderful  Marsha did that. 
[01:36:00]  She is.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I love when they stumble on lines like that.  I know.  How great Marsha is.  Great.  And then there was an episode where Jan, I don't know, it seems like she lost her footing  and might have fallen.  Face first into Marsha.  Hey, you guys.  Oh, my nose.  Yeah.  I'll fall into the fall.  She falls face first.  Yes.  You hurt Marsha's nose in that episode.  Yeah.  And you know, the book's going to come out and it's not going to be anything good. 
[01:36:30]  It's going to suck.  No.  The whole book's going to suck.  It's going to be like three pages.  They practiced kissing for boys on each other.  Yeah.  It was real chaste.  And they shared a joint, maybe got a little nutty.  It's going to be awful.  It would be fantastic if it was just some of the most hardcore crap you've ever read in  your life.  It's just like, I wore a device with a belt that made me kind of like a boy.  NB Davis made me wear the black one. 
[01:37:00]  And like naming specific things.  Like if you look during episode 32, you could see when I'm coming down the stairs, I can't  walk right.  You know, just something.  It might have explained why Cindy didn't come back for one of those reunion shows.  Remember they had to replace her?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They made her watch.  They did.  Look at this.  Look at it.  She's like, I'm too young.  Come on.  Stop it.  Until you can say Sally sells seashores.  You don't get to do. 
[01:37:30]  Sally sells seashores.  Sell seashores.  Wow.  Whatever she sells.  Bring that dirty little lisp over here.  We'll straighten that mouth out.  It's not going to be good at all.  Well, supposedly the publisher over the weekend was on one of the shows and said that he denied  the story is true.  Really?  Yeah, on ABC News.  Who denied the story?  The publisher?  The publisher, I guess.  The publisher.  There's nothing about that.  The publisher came out over the weekend and denied the story.  Why would the publisher want to quell that story?  Yeah, really.  The publisher should be out there fueling the fire. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, you should read what's in there.  It's so hot.  We can't talk about it.  I'm turgid just thinking about it.  You want to talk that up.  Were you guys ever on Letterman?  You guys were on Letterman, right?  Yeah.  Tomorrow night's the first time I'm ever going to be on Letterman.  Oh, nice, man.  That's a first for me.  Congrats.  I've asked a few times, but I've always done Leno, but I'm out here.  So I was like, all right, I'll give it a shot.  Be a two-show guy.  That's it.  Yeah.  He's a little... 
[01:38:30]  Pull off.  I don't got enough juice to let me be a two-show guy.  You can't be a two-show guy?  No.  I'm just shocked they let me be a one-show guy.  We were supposed to go back on Letterman, and then we decided to do Leno last Christmas,  and because of that, now I think the Letterman people...  We got all cocky and thought we could be a two-show guy.  Yeah.  Only Kevin Smith can be a two-show guy.  We were two-show guys.  We're shock jocks.  We're idiots.  We were short too close to the sun on wings of wax.  Yeah.  We were feeling good.  We did Letterman.  Now we do Leno.  I've seen people do this. 
[01:39:00]  Chuck Heston used to do that.  After the Letterman appearance, we're upstairs celebrating.  It went well, and some producer we didn't see prior comes up and goes,  you guys were unbelievable, blah, blah, blah, and we want to book you immediately to come back.  And then the writers, who are pretty good friends of the show, they're like,  that never happens.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was great.  And then Ant and I got cocky and...  You tried charging them for your next appearance.  Let's negotiate.  $10,000 a pop.  They're like, come on.  Well, then a few months went by, and we still didn't have the booking, 
[01:39:30]  and Leno's people were calling.  So we're like, yeah, screw it.  Let's go do Leno.  That would be cool.  And the Letterman people didn't find it.  Well, they called back and said, you know, we want to have you on,  and it was coincidentally the same day we were going to do Leno.  That was after we told them we were doing Leno,  and then they wanted Trump to Leno appearance by booking us on the same day.  And I remember being in a hotel room on Long Island, and I'm on the phone with my agent,  and he's like, they're fighting over you guys.  I'm like, get out of here.  No, this is like...  Get out of here.  I thought it was very silly because I wanted... 
[01:40:00]  I just wanted to do both shows, not realizing you can't be two-show guy.  You're dopey shock jock somewhere.  So we blew it.  So they're like Brad Pitt, two-show guy.  Absolutely.  You know, Sean Penn, two-show guy.  Right.  Two-show guy...  No, I don't know about Sean Penn.  Sean Penn, you don't think would be two-show guy?  Brad Pitt, definitely.  Jim Norton, two-show guy.  Jim Norton is two-show guy.  Jim Norton is certainly two-show guy.  Are you still two-show guy?  Yes.  Yeah, he is.  Letterman, have your back.  He will, yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:40:30]  That sounds like a threat.  You're a two-show guy.  You know how it is.  God, that annoys me.  That's how I roll.  You bug me that you're a two-show guy.  Orton might be doing one of those shows in the near future.  Yeah, Club Wraith, Leno.  Back to the reg.  I'm going to say hi to Jay.  And what are you doing on Leno?  Are you doing stand-up or are you doing couch?  Stand-up and paddle.  He gives me both usually.  I'm not good enough for just couch, but...  He's going to be...  Oh, you've got a book house.  You've got to earn your supper by going out there and talking jokes,  and then they let you sit down.  I've got a scat man crudders for a few minutes.  Yeah, that's it.  Go over and sit down and get an axe in the chest like you should. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, changing gears, because we discussed about an hour ago,  I got the Kid Nation clips.  Oh, thank goodness.  So it's like Survivor for little kids.  It's the saddest thing I've heard.  I only heard a piece of these during a break.  I am so hooked on this show, not for the reason everyone else is.  I find it hilarious that these kids are crying.  I haven't seen the show yet, got a TVR,  but from hearing these clips, it sounds like the greatest show ever made.  It's televised child abuse.  It's fantastic. 
[01:41:30]  Survivor for the little tots.  We meet Taylor, the beauty queen.  Just a couple of really quick clips here.  She's, I don't know, like 12.  She's a beauty queen back home.  A beauty queen at 12.  And she misses home and healthy food.  Taylor, what's wrong?  I'm just, like, missing home,  and I'm just missing my own bed,  and, like, getting to eat protein, like, and meats and all,  and just, like, eating a healthy meal.  So it's real hard.  Taylor is having a pretty tough time  compared to the rest of the council members  because I think she's the youngest, 
[01:42:00]  and this is really tough on a young kid.  It's really hard because it's dusty, we're dirty, we're cold.  Today was one of the harder than I realized I'm going to leave.  I'm going to kill myself.  Wait a second.  These kids are just killing themselves.  Are you sure this is a network TV show?  Because I heard kids saying words like dirty, hard, protein, and meat.  Very good.  I can't get enough of it because it's the Survivor format, 
[01:42:30]  but it's little kids.  Little kids.  They're going to go with infants next.  But 12 counts as a kid?  Like, when I saw the ads for, like, Kid Nation,  I was like, they're five-year-olds.  Yeah, let's get, like, a bunch of five- and six-year-olds out there.  This is more like pre-teen nation because it's a 12-year-old.  They don't know how to live it.  But they don't know what they're doing.  And they think, like, they think they can get something going here.  And it's an old, what, pioneer town or something?  Ah, it looks like Hollywood might have built it.  Great.  We found an old ghost town, kids. 
[01:43:00]  And now you're going to have to turn it around.  That's kind of what they're talking about.  Does Jim Backus come and lock him in the jail?  Because they think he's jumping the claim,  and then the two girls go at it in the jail cell?  Get away from my money.  What are you?  Oh, I'm a goo.  You've done it again.  Well, we meet eight-year-old Jimmy.  See, they're from eight years old to 15.  Do they give them last names or just first name basis? 
[01:43:30]  I think just first name, yeah.  That makes a kid cuter.  This is hilarious.  All of a sudden, they're having fun, and they don't know where Jimmy is,  and he's behind a building by himself, losing his mind, crying for mommy.  Poor little Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy?  Where's Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Piano.  Sucking snot.  Jimmy!  Oh, that's little Jimmy.  He's adorable. 
[01:44:00]  Just kidding, man.  Right here.  Let's go.  What's going on?  I'm only eight.  I'm in a third grader, and I don't think I'm...  I think I'm too young to be doing this.  Oh, send the kid home.  Oh, for the love of God.  Send the kid home.  He's crying that he's too young for this.  Oh, what an awful show.  Dude, you got it on DVR?  Oh, watch it.  Believe me.  I could look away, man.  It's more of a relief to hear the kid crying, because he's like, I'm in third grade, and 
[01:44:30]  I can't handle this.  Because tears like that, you expect him to be like, the cameraman showed me it.  Oh, thank God.  He's only upset for being here.  Too much stress.  Too much pressure.  You know what's great?  He realizes something the producers didn't.  Right.  Look, I'm too young to be here.  Look, maybe they should start at nine years old.  They figured out where the cutoff should be.  The producers know exactly what they're doing, man.  That's on TV.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of adults were there to prevent fights and stuff? 
[01:45:00]  There had to be somebody there.  Well, obviously...  They're saying there wasn't, but there had to be.  What takes me out is like, all right, obviously there's a cameraman there.  They're filming the whole thing, so he's an adult.  Little kids running the cameras.  And then they have the host that pops out every once in a while, so he's an adult.  Is he a creep?  You've got to assume there's just adults everywhere.  They don't show them, so you're just seeing the kids, so you're thinking they're all alone.  But obviously they're not.  Here's more of Jimmy.  Learn greater, and I don't think I'm...  I think I'm too young to be doing this.  Even if you're really young, you're really cool, and you're really awesome, and you can really 
[01:45:30]  do a lot for the sound.  Oh.  Oh, but I want to be older to do this.  I love her...  What a supportive kid, that other person.  Yes.  I love her logic.  You're really awesome.  You're cool, and you're awesome.  Oh, wow.  I didn't realize I was cool and awesome.  If I was crying in a playground, a girl would come up and be like, keep crying, fat boy.  Laughing at you.  It's only going to get worse.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  A day from D.C., he thinks little Jimmy's crying because he was playing Monster Rain under 
[01:46:00]  the old saloon.  Ah, could be.  Well, that's not that little Jimmy.  Linger Lunger.  So here's more.  Laurel tries to help Jimmy and tries to get Jimmy to stay.  I know you're really upset because you don't have your mother here to tuck you in, and you  really miss your family.  And my dad.  And your dad.  And I'm going to try to, like, substitute for them.  Just for a little while and just make you feel a lot more comfortable here.  Just give him a chance.  Can you do that?  Go Sox.  Yeah.  Laurel, he's really, really nice.  We all try to stay. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God.  So Laurel's trying to form an alliance with Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The alliances.  Oh, that poor little kid.  Jimmy's got to watch his back because Laurel's helpful now, but when it comes time to, like,  who's going to win the fat gold star, Laurel will step on Jimmy's neck.  She's going to learn everything about him, all his weaknesses, and then just turn him into  a mush.  Just use it again.  Wait, do they boot kids, too?  They boot you off?  Well, they have, like, a town meeting, I guess, every week, and if you can't handle it anymore, 
[01:47:00]  you can say you're going to go home, and that's the clip I'm about to play for you.  So what's the object?  To make it so miserable for somebody that they have to leave?  I don't know.  Whoever's the...  Mrs. Mommy?  Whoever's the star for the week, you know, the one that's doing the most wins that 20,000  gold star, Kevin Smith, was alluding to earlier.  What I love about Kid Nation, this is the first show where we're exploiting kids.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember, it all started with...  Little Rascals.  Well, yeah.  It's great.  Remember...  Those are cinematic shorts. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  Yeah.  It all started with Survivor, and then fast forward, you know, whatever, it's all these  crazy reality shows that are completely ridiculous, right?  This is the first one.  It's a little under control and stuff.  You know, they're opening up a whole new world here.  You can only hope.  Uh, here's Jimmy, uh, saying he wants to go home.  Jimmy, come on.  Jimmy, why do you want to go home?  I'm really homesick.  I think I'm way too young for this.  Right, we get it.  I think he's more mature than a lot of other kids. 
[01:48:00]  It's scary.  Do you want to leave this entire experience and go back home?  Jimmy, come on.  Kid's like, what does experience mean?  Jimmy, you're doing a good job.  Tell him, Jimmy.  I thought it would be like a big, fun adventure, and I would last the whole time, but I miss  my family a lot.  Well, you are an extraordinarily brave eight-year-old.  No, you're not.  You could.  Yeah, really.  That's the opposite of your own.  You're a wussy.  And we're proud of you.  Are you guys proud of Jimmy? 
[01:48:30]  No.  Just mock him.  Jimmy, you've let us all down.  Mock him on the way out.  Oh, his parents, like his parents, to his face, had to be like, it's okay, but when  that door closed and Jimmy went to sleep, they were like, oh.  Had to talk.  Oh, my God.  Couldn't you have just hacked it?  Day one?  He's gone?  Couldn't you have ever taught him to be a man?  That was your job.  Day one?  Yeah, you're the one that gives him too much of the mothering.  How long did you breastfeed him for? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, you made him soft.  Adam on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was just thinking about how the kids are sitting there crying and stuff, and the  director or the producer is sitting there going, please, God, let this kid snort like  a huge snot ball.  It's a big bubble.  No doubt.  It gets the big bubble out of his nose.  That's what I'd be doing.  I'd be sitting there going, keep rolling.  This is money.  This is the good stuff. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yeah.  They knew he was crying all by himself behind a building.  Like, all right, wait for the camera, man.  We got to get this on film.  Get that camera over there right now.  There's a kid crying.  Yeah.  That's the whole reason you filmed this dumb show.  Cha-ching.  One other clip, and then we'll move on.  But the kids, they're moving the wagons to the village.  Wagons.  They have these wagons like two, I don't know, a couple miles out from the village, and  they have to now haul it into the village.  And a kid-  By themselves or with horses or something?  By themselves, just pulling them along.  And this one kid goes down.  He hurts his leg really bad. 
[01:50:00]  So what's really funny is the kids now, now they're just going to try to diagnose the  kid.  They put mud and leaves on it?  They might as well have.  That'll fix it.  Let's get out of this place.  Let's get out of this place.  I don't think it's too much fun living in the old days.  I told you that would happen.  The old days.  No fun.  1976.  What happened, man?  What happened?  I broke my knee, man.  What happened? 
[01:50:30]  What happened?  What happened?  Is it a sudden pain or a...  Yes.  Right here?  Right here?  Kid sounds 19.  Yeah.  Sudden pain?  Yes.  And I'll grab Doc Baker.  Yes.  Listen, but they decide right away.  Gotta go to Sleepy Eye.  They decide right away what it is.  Keep your foot down.  It's just a muscle.  I think it's like a spasm.  Cut it off.  Let's just kill him.  Little kids, they don't know. 
[01:51:00]  Hit him with a rock.  I didn't learn the word spasm until I was 22.  Yeah.  What kid knows that word?  It seems to be a spasm of sorts.  They're trying to hint that this is like a Lord of the Flies thing, too, you know?  Yeah.  They don't have enough guts to take it to the Lord of the Flies.  No, really take it to that limit.  There's no piggy in that group.  No, no.  They need a piggy.  Hunted.  Yeah.  The music is hysterical.  When they're crying, it's the sad piano music.  That was that action.  Oh, my God.  Something awful's happened.  The whole show was kids crying. 
[01:51:30]  When was the last time anybody in this room has watched Caligula?  Oh, man.  I love it.  I just re-watched Caligula recently, and it's a very bizarre, trippy movie.  But there's one moment where Malcolm McDowell is Caligula, and he's taken over as the  emperor, and they're all sitting in the Forum or the Coliseum or something like that.  It's not really the round thing, but big field of dirt, dudes buried up to their necks in  the dirt, a huge wall that's being pushed that has rotor blades on it, and people are 
[01:52:00]  pitching eggs and rocks at the people who are buried up to their neck, who can't move,  and their whole body's immersed underground.  Rotting fruit, and then essentially this giant head lawnmower comes at them slowly and  eventually just lops their head off.  And you sit there watching it going, like, there's no way this ever could have happened.  Like, they weren't that starved for entertainment.  And then you've got Kid Nation, and you've got the old woman dying on YouTube with the  kid with the shaving cream.  And you realize we are not that far removed from the head lawnmower. 
[01:52:30]  Head lawnmower.  Head lawnmower's next, man.  Yeah, we're heading that way.  Absolutely next.  It started with Survivor.  Head lawnmower would make it on.  Head lawnmower's next.  And who wouldn't watch that show?  You'd absolutely watch Head lawnmower.  There's a great moment where McDowell is giggling.  He's in a giddy mood, and he goes, and he lobs the fruit in a dainty fashion at the head  of the guy who used to run his guard, but he was afraid the guy was going to assassinate  him.  And just the little, the gay giggle when he throws it, it's just such good fun he's 
[01:53:00]  having.  And the amazing thing is, that's the dude that helped him be emperor by killing, you  know, Tiberius.  Yeah.  And they put him to death with the head lawnmower.  Let's go.  We're so not far removed.  We're getting there.  It's coming.  I can't wait.  Nathan in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What if Vince McMahon was the director of Kid Nation?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  I think it might go a little something like this.  It might sound like this. 
[01:53:30]  Performing seal for you, sir.  All right.  Here's the kid with the hurt leg.  Walk slowly.  Help walking.  I think I pulled a muscle in my leg or something.  It was very painful.  I'm going to lift you up.  Ready?  Ready?  Greg, help me out.  That was pretty cool.  All right.  Ready?  Set?  Go.  And they're back.  That sounds nice from Witness, man, where they're putting up the barn.  Are they all nice to each other?  I mean, that sounds like the most civil bunch of kids in the world. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  These aren't kids like I grew up with.  Now they got four teams.  They're cruel bastards.  Now they got four teams, and they do things now.  Is there a bully in the bunch?  There's a bully, yeah.  Is there?  How old?  Fifteen.  Oh, yeah.  Again, these aren't kids, man.  That's not Kid Nation.  That's an adult.  They can get in the face of an 11-year-old, I believe.  Really?  Yeah.  So, hey, we got to take a break.  I'm getting some info here that Roland, our own Roland.  Yeah.  This could be a good segment because we got Kevin Smith here, of course.  Yes.  Roland likes chick flicks. 
[01:54:30]  Goes to a lot of them.  I guess.  That's what we're hearing.  That's the name of my next script.  Roland likes chick flicks.  Chick flicks.  And let's not forget, Kevin Smith hanging all morning, has been making the show fly by.  I'm not a has-be, dude.  Don't call him back.  Come on.  That's terrible.  I'm here.  The fly should- The fly.  The show is flying by.  Don't forget to pick up his book, My Boring-Ass Life, The Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin  Smith.  And Letterman tomorrow night?  Letterman tomorrow night, sir.  Who are you on with?  Do you know?  I think it's the broad who's on Grey's Anatomy, who now has her own show. 
[01:55:00]  Just got married.  No one cares about her.  It's all about you tomorrow night.  She's first.  But she's first.  She's first.  Of course.  They have to get the broad out of the way.  She'll suck the life out of the show.  Totally.  Because if we put the fat guy on first, nobody's going to stick around for the good-looking  chick.  I've got to follow the good-looking chick.  Nah, they just put her stupid face on because they figure people will sit through her to get  to you.  After you're done.  Who wants to listen to her nonsense?  And then, second season, shut up.  Was it good?  I learned so much from her. 
[01:55:30]  My character was just...  Yeah, was she?  We never gave you anything.  How was it?  It's so much fun.  Man, I've done Leno a bunch, right?  And I followed...  What's her name?  The chick was on The O.C.  Pretty Chick.  The O.C.  Misha Barton or something like that?  Yeah.  And those first guests get two segments.  You're out there for four or five minutes, and then you've got an additional four or five  minutes or something like that.  And she was...  It was death, dude.  Ooh. 
[01:56:00]  I had to follow her out there, and it was one of the most painful interviews I ever watched,  and I had to go out and be funny.  That's better, though.  That's better.  You don't want to follow killing.  I did kill, though.  You don't want to follow killing.  It sucked going in front.  Going behind her, I was just like, oh, my God.  Who's still watching?  It turns out.  That's the thing.  Number one, everyone tuned out.  But I figured, like, all I have to do is be one-tenth funny, and I'm there.  Yeah, you've done some great stuff on Leno's show.  We've got to take a break.  We're like 15 minutes late.  Oh, damn.  Hold that thought, Jimmy. 
[01:56:30]  Roland, chick flicks?  Thumbs up?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk to you next as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Just a few minutes left on this side of the show.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to thank Kevin Smith.  He's been great.  He gave us a nice energy for a Monday.  Hey, we were just talking about how the show just flew by today.  Way dead.  Well, this side of it.  Uh, Roland.  Oh, hold on.  What's up?  Going all right?  What?  Going okay.  All right.  You going to get Into the Wild Dude for us? 
[01:57:00]  Wild dude?  Huh?  Wild dude?  Into the Wild.  Oh.  That dude that was the lead in that movie, directed by Sean Penn.  They're checking the schedule.  All right.  Very cool.  Is it true you like chick flicks?  I do.  Huh?  That's a no.  That's a no.  Checking a schedule is a no.  Yeah, why didn't we get Mila?  What happened to Mila Jovovich?  Thank you.  She's in Australia filming.  I don't care.  Shut up with that.  They're somewhere else filming.  We were supposed to get Mila Jovovich.  She never came to New York. 
[01:57:30]  Where is she now?  What?  Where is she now?  Uh, I don't know.  Where is she filming?  Can we get a-  Australia.  Where?  Australia.  All right.  It's like seven o'clock at night in Australia.  She had a great time on our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a YouTube video.  You know, she's laughing so hard she fell off a chair.  She had a great time with us.  Yeah.  What about the other brought there from the movie?  Oh, the Heroes?  They had to film together.  Allie Larder?  Yeah.  The Heroes is shooting around the clock, too.  Around the clock.  24 hours a day.  Wow, that's some shooting schedule.  For the writer's strike.  You know, we got a professional here. 
[01:58:00]  We should ask Kevin Smith.  I worked with Allie.  Allie was in Jane Silent Bob Shrek.  But when you don't want to do an interview, don't you come up with stuff like, ah, my shooting  schedule, I'm in another country, I'm having my time of the month.  And somebody does come up with stuff.  Publicists.  Publicists, right?  The professional liars.  See?  But generally, I pretty much do whatever they put in front of me.  I had one of those moments with her as I'm watching her on TV, and I'm going, where  the f*** do I know her from?  Also, Varsity Blue.  She was the whipped cream girl.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:58:30]  The whipped cream bikini.  But it wasn't that.  And then I'm like, ah, Jane Silent Bob.  Absolutely.  One that farted.  She's a good lady, man.  Yeah.  She's from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  Is she?  A Jersey girl?  Jersey girl.  Look at that.  Well, Mila should have been on our show.  Resident Evil's the biggest movie of the weekend.  You know, and she's like a friend of the show.  Yeah, but she never made it to New York.  So, phone.  Phone call.  Oh, okay.  You guys said the aliens in studio only.  For Mila Jovovich?  I don't know. 
[01:59:00]  You do kind of want her in studio, but.  I heard, and Dane is not coming.  He's calling instead.  That's ridiculous.  Unless he's in Boston.  He's in Boston.  He's in Boston.  He's coming with Baldwin.  Boston, Australia.  Hold on.  Dane Cook was in New York last week.  Yeah.  He did everything.  He did everything except our show.  Yeah.  Literally.  Everything.  But that wasn't him.  That was his rep.  No.  Dane Cook is him.  I know, but they scheduled him.  That isn't him.  Dane Cook knows we're here. 
[01:59:30]  I love the talk.  I love the rep talk.  I love the publicist garbage.  That isn't him.  No, no.  It's a robot.  Dane Cook is very aware of the Opie and Anthony show.  And if he really wanted to be on the Opie and Anthony show when he was in New York, he  would have stopped by.  We have all the same friends.  Yeah.  That was him.  He decided not to do our show.  No, they scheduled him like three TV interviews at this time.  So that's why he couldn't do it while he was in New York.  I was asked to do another morning radio show.  Yeah?  Really?  That's no longer on Terrestrial, but only on... 
[02:00:00]  You turned down Bubba.  He was very brave.  You turned down Martha Stewart.  But I came here.  I made time to come here.  Thank you, sir.  You had a hell of a night.  I've been up all night.  I've not been asleep in over 24 hours.  I wanted to go so bad.  It was good, man.  Your boy, Big Kev.  That's what I hear.  Was it a legitimate win, or were you seven-deuce offsuting it, you bastard?  It was a legitimate win, but here's the genius part of it.  At one point, we play in the store, right? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  You've been there.  And we had the, you know, the Rocketeer, the movie The Rocketeer?  Yep.  There was a helmet.  Like, what do they call those things?  Master replica.  Replica helmet.  Like, built to scale, and you could put it on and look like, you know, the Rocketeer.  The Rocketeer.  Unless you look like me or Big Kev, which case, you don't look like the Rocketeer at all.  But anyway, he wanted it really badly, and then through one series of dares and half-truths  to another, he wound up having to wear it throughout the whole game in order to get somebody to pay 
[02:01:00]  for half of it.  Wow.  My friend Jim was there, and Jim was like, you know, I'll pay for half of it if you wear  it the whole game.  And he wore it the whole game.  And it must have brought him luck, too, I guess.  It must have sweated bullets, too, because it was really heavy.  It made metal and stuff.  But he made it more of a metal helmet.  The beauty of it is, like, you're unreadable.  It's like, you know how some dorks wear sunglasses at the table?  He wore a face mask.  That is unreadable in a poker game. 
[02:01:30]  And he took second, man.  He walked away with, like, a man.  A thousand bucks.  Nice.  Taking a poker face right out of the game.  Totally.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that.  You couldn't read through that.  You wore that the entire game?  That's the Rocketeer?  That is a real Rocketeer helmet.  It looks like Iron Man's helmet.  He lost, like, ten pounds in his head that night because he was sweating so much.  Could you put that on, Kevin, please?  That is frightening looking.  I don't get that.  That is really cool.  I don't get the geek culture.  Like, to me, that's like...  No, dude, that's a cool helmet.  That's a cool mask, dude. 
[02:02:00]  I guess.  Wow.  That's a mask you want to put on and go shoot a computer.  He looks like a cricket.  Exactly.  Giant cricket.  It's cricket.  We ought to play Rocketeer or Nazi.  Who gets a cab?  You're sitting across from that guy, and you've got a full boat, but this dude pushes all  in, and you're like, I guess he's got a bigger boat.  I mean, what's going on?  But his eyes are showing.  You can see his eyes.  That's the one thing you want to hide in poker.  No one cares about your lip or your nose.  But behind all that?  I don't know.  But we played all night.  We ended at four in the morning. 
[02:02:30]  I was like, we've got to go in the city.  That would have been a problem.  Time for ONA.  Here's the creepy part.  Kevin wears that alone.  I know you do.  When he's alone, he's nude on his computer with that mask.  Running from room to room.  He's in questionable chat rooms.  He's on a red tube.  His screen name is Ride Home 505.  Roland.  That is cool, man.  Chick flicks rolling?  Yeah.  I enjoy watching them.  You enjoy watching them, so it's not like a girl is dragging you out to see them. 
[02:03:00]  Why do you enjoy chick flicks?  I don't know.  I just go see movies.  Like, Once was really good.  I'm with you, man.  It does.  It's amazing.  I'm a big chick flick fan.  Yeah.  I could tell you are.  I totally am, man.  I can watch Fried Green Tomatoes.  Oh, Jesus.  Over and over again.  Love it.  Bridges in Madison County.  My wife is just like, how can you watch that crap?  Really?  Yeah, totally.  What about Sisterhood of the Stretchy Pants?  Stretchy Pants?  That's what it was called. 
[02:03:30]  I can watch that.  The Traveling Pants.  That once.  Worst chick flick I can watch more than once.  Worst chick flick I got dragged to by the ex-wife.  Bridge.  No, it wasn't even.  Bridges in Madison County at least had, like, Clint Eastwood in it.  This was the love letter.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Look, it's rolling over there.  Holy Jesus Christ, was that just a steaming pile to have to sit and watch.  It wasn't even interesting in a way.  Sometimes you could sit and watch a chick flick, and you're sitting just going, like, 
[02:04:00]  this sucks, but, all right, there's a story here.  At least I could kind of work with that.  Horrid.  That one's a little heavy-handed.  Horrid.  Did you see the notebook?  No.  Never saw it?  Notebook would make you cry, man.  Yeah.  Notebook was good.  Did you see the...  See?  Aha!  Dude, look at you.  Look at you.  Ozzy cried watching The Notebook.  I remember that.  Yes.  Ah, Notebook was all right, man.  That's good.  Alzheimer's will make anybody cry, man.  Oh, is that it?  Heartbreaking.  Oh, right, okay. 
[02:04:30]  I'm trying to remember what movie it was.  Now I do.  What?  Yeah.  The Notebook.  James Garner.  Yeah.  And Ryan Gosling.  And Ryan Gosling.  And Rachel McAdams.  Did you see The Lake House?  Yeah.  No, that I couldn't do.  That I couldn't sit through.  Sandy Bullock vehicles, I kind of...  Yeah.  She's pretty good.  Ask Rollins.  She's pretty good.  Ask Rollins how it started.  As far as watching chick flicks.  My mom dragged me to every chick flick movie.  My dad wouldn't go.  My brother's seven years older than I am.  So I was it.  Growing up. 
[02:05:00]  It's like my brother would go see the action movies.  Then I'd come home.  Guess what I saw?  My mommy would take me to action movies and cool movies.  We went to go see Alien when it first came out.  You were 30.  No, I wasn't.  30.  1979.  Jesus.  I think it's really cute that you both dated your moms.  I went out with my mom.  She was hot and she gave it up.  She's still hot.  Hey.  But we go to see Alien in Oyster Bay.  I think it was a movie theater over there. 
[02:05:30]  And sold out.  And I'm like really disappointed because I wanted to see Alien.  So to make up for it because I was so disappointed, she took me down the road to go see Battlestar Galactica.  In the movie theater.  A pale comparison.  Oh.  Just not even.  Pale replacement.  Yeah.  And she had just sitting there.  A big screen TV movie.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Big screen TV movie.  Worst replacement ever.  I wanted to see My Bodyguard.  My father took me to see Woody Allen's Stardust Memories.  It was a black and white, not Woody's best. 
[02:06:00]  It was a bad film.  And you're a kid, so.  I wanted to spit in my father's face.  Then he finally took me to see My Bodyguard.  We call it the last half of My Bodyguard.  I was so.  We went to a drive-in one time, and I forget what we saw, but the second one was The Sensuous Nurse with Ursula Andrus.  And I really wanted to stay and watch it with my dad.  Time to go, son.  He made me leave because he probably knew what we'd wind up doing.  That's like I had to sit in a drive-in movie in a pickup truck with my father in the driver's seat,  his girlfriend, wife, whatever, in the middle, and me in the passenger seat, and Barbarella was playing. 
[02:06:30]  And no, it hadn't just come out.  But it was a drive-in.  And at the beginning, they show her pretty naked.  Yes, taking her gear off.  Doing things.  Yeah, taking her gear off.  And I was getting so worked up.  And I couldn't just breathe heavy.  And I was breathing like.  And the windows were getting so fogged up.  I was so embarrassed. 
[02:07:00]  I was throwing off a heat like my body was throwing off the heat.  That was steaming the windows up.  It was so embarrassing.  Did they say anything to you?  No.  I'd roll the window down.  I was like, oh, yeah.  I'm going to go get some popcorn.  My full lean photo, I'm pointing.  I was like.  Trying to get the window clear.  It was so embarrassing.  When we got our first VCR, we got a Betamax.  Nice.  And we went to a video store, joined a club, and a beta section was very small. 
[02:07:30]  But I was 11 years old, maybe 12.  And I was there with one of my best friends.  And we went up to the camera.  I was like, you rent what you want.  And we were like, give us the worst horror movie you got.  Because we were of that age.  And they gave us blood-sucking freaks.  Oh, yes.  Oh, wow.  And didn't give us any inkling what it was about.  Box looked pretty horrible.  We go home and watch it.  And my father's watching it with us.  And my mom is cooking dinner in the kitchen.  And I believe it was the line, you might want to be ready for the dump.  I believe it was the line, I think her mouth would make an interesting urinal. 
[02:08:00]  That brought my mother racing out of the kitchen going, what are you watching?  What the hell are you watching?  He's loaded with naked women with bullseyes drawn on them, with darts in them.  What was the name of the midget in that movie?  Oh, I forgot.  He had a really weird name, the midget from Blood-Sucking Freaks.  Yeah.  Billy Barty?  In the movie.  His name in the movie.  Hey, they're going to turn us off here.  Kevin Smith.  Just fantastic, man.  Thanks for hanging out with us.  Thanks for having me.  My Boring-Ass Life, the uncomfortably candid diary of Kevin Smith in bookstores now. 
[02:08:30]  And Reaper on Tuesday.  Watch Reaper on Tuesday.  Yes.  CW.  And tomorrow night, Kevin's on Letterman, too.  I'm on Letterman.  That's all.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  We just spent the last 15 minutes discussing how Anthony's going to get home today. 
[02:09:00]  We're all idiots in this country.  Give the time a day and luxury to these savages.  For the rest of America, let me just set the table here and make sure everyone has their  proper...  I need a fork.  Yeah.  Make sure the Civil War is out on the table.  Ah, shit.  Let me just set the table.  Ah, there you go.  Oh, you scared me for a second, but I forgot we're on the shit part of the...  Oh, for the rest of America, the UN is in session for the next, what, two or three weeks? 
[02:09:30]  Yes.  We were going to let you sleep, sir.  Oh, I was...  I was going to bring that up in a second.  Somebody was like, oh, that's the just planned best of.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you started talking about something that was current, and I was like,  they don't want me in the room.  No.  They're tricking me.  Kevin goes, how much time between shows?  I was like, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes.  You're like, all right, I'm going to...  What did you say?  I thought you were going smoking.  Uh, no.  I was just going to go chill out.  He went into the green room and passed out, because everyone was giving us reports. 
[02:10:00]  Just to lay down a little bit.  Kevin Smith is asleep.  Let's make our YouTube video.  I went into my immediate sleep pose, where I jam a hand down my pants and cut my balls.  Dude.  Is that it?  It's a great way to sleep.  Very protective.  Very chimp-like.  It's a great chimp-like.  Way to sleep.  If he falls asleep, man, and no doubt, within the first five minutes, the hand...  It can be like...  You can handcuff it behind his head like fucking Houdini, and it will slide down.  He'll slide down his body, snake down his fucking pants, and he just grips that shit.  I don't grip, but I have to have it on my crotch.  What do you think that's about?  You think like when he was a kid, somebody went to touch him, and so now he's just got 
[02:10:30]  a couple...  Just got to protect it.  Safe feeling.  Or maybe it's just...  Pride in your cock.  It just feels good to hold it.  Yeah.  It feels better if you hold it and jerked it.  I jerked...  We're an XM, right?  I was so fucking...  I jerked off last night before bed, because I couldn't sleep, so I jerked off a second time  when my dick was limp.  Like, it was awful.  I was just flogging a noodle, and I swear to God, as I came, I said, why am I such a  junkie?  Did you come twice?  Yeah, but the second time... 
[02:11:00]  It was barely there.  It's like a dry heat.  I could hear my dick going, all right, sleep.  Like...  It was awful.  Just spitting out dust.  Dude, it was limp.  My dick was limp the whole time.  It hurt.  That's wonderful.  I have not jerked off and then jerked off again right away in a long time.  It's been a while.  It's been an hour?  Yeah.  I've had an hour in between.  20-minute downtime.  That's not bad.  As a kid, just sometimes three times in a row, you're just so horned up.  Like, parents are out of the house?  Yeah.  I'm gonna jerk off on shit I never thought about jerking off near before. 
[02:11:30]  And each one was like fucking a torpedo launch.  And now...  Fucking ropes of jibs.  Two times, like you're saying, it's just dribbling out.  An hour later, though, and I just...  I wasn't horny.  It's like that $5 shake coming out of Mia Wallace's mouth.  Just kind of, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.  It dribbles down your hand.  Why does it go to sleep?  Yeah, I just figured the energy...  But I just...  I'm just an addict.  It's fucking awful, man.  And do you need anything or do you just tug it?  Just go into the theater of the mind?  I was on X-Tube. 
[02:12:00]  X-Tube.  Theater of the mind.  Wait, what's X-Tube?  We learned about RedTube.  X-Tube is better because there's a lot of...  You go to videos on X-Tube, and there's a lot of stuff.  Oh, yeah?  That's been my new thing lately.  I love watching really amateur anal videos.  Ah.  Like, but not amateur, like, you know, Vivid presents amateur videos.  Just like some guy talked his girlfriend into letting him fuck her up the ass,  and he's holding the camera, and it's the worst lighting and shit. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, that's so much stuff.  I'm looking for that moment where...  But that's so much hotter than the...  That's so much hotter.  ...the well-produced...  I do agree.  But it's also like that moment.  When you watch porn and they're doing an anal scene and shit,  you know she's, like, totally ass-douched out.  I'm looking for, like, the amateur anal porn video  where the dude pulls back a little too much,  and you see some shit staying on his dick.  Yeah, like Butt Kelly?  Yes.  That's what I want to say.  That's what I want to say.  Butt Kelly is the point where people call it.  Yeah, you go to a...  There's one video I watched.  There was a girl, like, she's not attractive at all, though. 
[02:13:00]  They don't have to be, because usually they're zoomed in on the part.  Well, there's a couple of chicks that are sucking dicks through glory holes.  Like, I guess their husbands film them.  And this one girl has a whole site where she's just fucking banging and blowing strangers  through a glory...  It's fucking really hot, man.  This is the first time I've been on this website,  and I'm enjoying the tennis racket girl that E-Rock just had up.  Just getting spanked by it with the tennis racket.  I'm not into the spanking thing.  Here's my other site, the site that I fucking love.  Largelabia.com.  Oh, you're a big pussy freak? 
[02:13:30]  Love it.  Me too.  I love them grossly misshapen and fucking huge.  Yes.  I don't know why.  I've never met one in my life.  Oh, I have.  Have you?  Yeah, big glit.  I would imagine no work whatsoever.  Well, the tennis racket, I thought it was just...  Wow, no.  I thought it was a cute little spanking, but boy, was I wrong.  It looks like the...  Remember the phone video chick?  Yeah.  Who, like, put the cell phone in?  Oh, Jesus.  She's putting a tennis racket handle up her ass.  I could look at the Largelabia site all day long.  Dude, when you're done with this enchanting home video, 
[02:14:00]  can you fucking look up big pussy lips?  And she was stuck in a costume?  Just go to Largelabia.com with a dash between Largelabia.  What do they have on it?  Is it giant cunts?  It's just basically giant...  No, it's not giant.  I mean, I guess some of the corresponding cunts are large, yes,  but it's clits as big as, like, two thumbs put together.  You know who Linda Might is?  Wouldn't that be called a cock?  Go to Linda...  Look for...  No, no, no.  Might as well be a fucking cock, dude.  Thank you.  At least Kevin will admit it.  No, this is mine.  I don't like hermaphrodites. 
[02:14:30]  Linda Might is a little even bigger.  Look at LindaMight.com.  She's like...  You can see, like, the lips.  Hers is almost too big.  That too, man.  I love...  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're jumping around too much.  Stay in large labia.  Where are we supposed to go after this, Kevin?  Crazy fucking...  I can't see really from here.  Hold on.  That doesn't look like the fact that I know.  I don't want designer vagina.  No laser.  No, this is...  Is this a medical site where they want to get their pussies reduced?  Uh-uh.  This is a site that celebrates the grossly misshapen. 
[02:15:00]  It's large.  Didn't you say there was something between large and labia?  My old lady doesn't have...  She has a very, you know, fucking...  Look, I love it.  I don't get me wrong.  But it's very...  I just like seeing something that I don't see.  My girlfriend is mad because I talk about big pussies on stage.  And she's like, people don't think you're talking about me.  And my girlfriend has a normal pussy.  And she's like, I don't want people thinking my pussy.  And I had to go on a site and show her a girl I fucked one time.  And I'm like...  It's a mess that's you.  I'm like, that's what I'm talking about. 
[02:15:30]  Hold on.  You showed your current girlfriend a girl you fucked one time?  Yeah, I don't think I said I fucked her, though.  But I think I said this is what I'm talking about.  But I might have told her a long time ago.  I'm like, this is...  I got that shit on my iPhone, bro.  Let me find the address I'm talking about.  That's got to be...  I don't know.  I'm the opposite.  I like it to look like a clamshell.  Really?  It's just got to be like...  I want you to shuck it.  Like, you got to be able to shuck that pussy to get your dick in.  I want it to look like a cartoon mouth.  That's it.  Did you see Sarah Silverman when she did it on the MTV? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, that was hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  She tilted her head and did it.  That was really funny.  Wait.  All right, what are we looking at, Jimmy?  I don't know.  This is...  Oh, come on.  That's someone giving birth.  That's awful.  That's an alien's mouth.  That's not real.  That's awful.  It is real.  That looks awful.  Steve, real or not real?  Real.  All right, so then it's not real.  It looks like a...  If Steve...  Whatever Steve says...  I'm sorry.  That looks like a tongue and a guy with no teeth.  This is the address to go to.  This is the address.  Large-labea-productions.com. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, wow.  Basically, large-labea-productions.com.  It's essentially all amateurs, and it's dudes and their girlfriends, there you go, who just  send in these candid shots of these clits that look like speed bags.  Like, you sit there, like, working them like Rocky.  They're so big.  I'm fascinated by it, man.  But when you read, like, the commentary and the testimonials and shit, it's crazy, because 
[02:17:00]  apparently, like, these chicks feel, for years, they've been, uh, uh, um, what do they call  that?  They feel embarrassed by it.  Chastised.  They use a pussy in the locker, these dumb chicks.  Hey, the word keeps escaping me lately.  When somebody's prejudiced against you, it begins with a D.  They've been discriminated against.  Oh.  Discriminated, sure.  They've been discriminated against because, like, you know, they're in the shower, the  girls are like, look at that fucking bubblegum-looking pussy of yours.  But meanwhile, there's a whole cult of dudes who love that kind of shit.  Are you going to be talking about this on Letterman tomorrow?  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  My pre-interview is going to be all about, I already got an email from the show, and  they were just like, you know, we're, we're not, uh, we're not real scatological, and  we don't really go in for the naughty talk, and I'm like, well, I got nothing, then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go book someone else.  Yeah.  I'm done.  I, I, I don't see any large labias yet.  Go to, hold on.  Well, no, this is the site.  I'm telling you, it's right there.  Click on, go to the left column with the, what's new.  I'm doing shit.  What's new?  Oh, it's crazy good, man.  If you like that kind of thing.  Some dudes don't, don't get into it, but I, I just. 
[02:18:00]  Well, Jimmy's, uh, right there with you, Kevin.  I like a fucking, do you understand, like, I like, I like, what turns me on more than  anything is, like, white panties, or like a, a white bikini bottom with a fucking meat  is bulging.  With a mound in it, dude, where it's just like, I agree.  I like a bald pussy bulge.  Fucking beat, I don't want the hair confusing the sight.  What do you think that is?  Like a good deli sandwich.  Do you think that's because, like, maybe, like, one of the first girls you ever fucked  around with had a large pussy, or is it just because it's freakish, weird?  It's mouthful, it's suckable, it's a fucking giant mouthful of pussy.  It's because it's like the weird sensation of, like, it puts you into an almost gay world, 
[02:18:30]  but you're safe from being gay because it's a woman, but you get a mouthful of something  that you wouldn't normally get.  Nah, because you could always suck tits if you just wanted a mouthful of something.  I think a mouthful of pussy is very sensual.  This is weird, meaty.  It's fucking big, fat lips, and it smells good.  Yes.  It's just a fucking, it's just fucking, it's very visceral.  There's something just like, mmm.  And I'm an oral dude, so that's, but yet I've never met one of these chicks in my life.  Really?  I had really, like, normal-looking, gorgeous pussies, but I want to, you know. 
[02:19:00]  Damn these girls with normal pussies.  However, but the idea of meeting a chick with pussy lips big enough to be a cock.  See, I don't like, there's a line where it goes, and I've never hooked up with a girl  like this, where I've seen where it almost looks like a hermaphrodite, and, like, I  know, I don't, that I don't want to see.  Linda Might is even a little bit too far for me, because she clit pumps, which I don't  like.  Yeah, I don't like that.  No, I like it natural.  I like it natural, too.  Me and you, brother, we're on the same fucking page.  I'll show you.  We gotta go out.  You know what you're doing.  We gotta go out catting around looking for chicks with lots of ink between them. 
[02:19:30]  Just meaty ones.  Did I just say, hear Jimmy say she clit-  Oh, God.  It's not attractive, but he's right.  When it's natural, it's a beautiful thing.  Ah.  It's very sexy.  Let's go to Linda Might's adult sight.  Yeah, she's really an older lady, but you see the clit bulge.  That's as far as I can go.  Dude, that's her clit bulging through her panties?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That looks like a little cock.  Yeah.  And her, I don't even like hers that much, because it's almost too masculine. 
[02:20:00]  I like smaller than that and younger.  Is it night or might?  Might.  So, like, if no one else will, Linda Might?  Exactly, yes.  But I like a good fucking-  How old is she?  Oh, she's an older lady.  Oh, she's pumping right there?  No, she's got a tilt.  I'll tell you all the places I surf, dude, because, of course, I won't pay for it.  I gotta go to the free site.  No, why should you?  Yeah, let's see your surf list.  My surf list is as follows, and I only discovered recently that it's on my iPhone, because I've 
[02:20:30]  downloaded all my bookmarks and shit like that.  Oh, that's good.  If you lose your iPhone.  People are wet.  PornoTube, the free voyeur web, PicCounter is my favorite, PicCounter.com.  What's that one?  That's just, like, basically, it gives you links to a bunch of different places.  They collect them under one roof, they give you all a bunch of thumbnails, so you can kind  of review what you're heading into, and then they take you off to different sites, and it's 
[02:21:00]  an adventure.  You never know where you're going to end up.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Exciting.  Massive Cox and Little Balls, that's my favorite set?  No.  ATK, All Natural and Hairy.  Yeah.  All Natural and Hairy.  Every once in a while, I like to get my freak on and see a chick wearing, like, a hair  bikini.  Wait, wait, let's go to that site.  That one, like, intrigues me.  I've always said, as far as, like, a freak show goes, what's... 
[02:21:30]  ATK, it's called All Natural and Hairy.  ATK.  The rest is, uh, I can't get the address.  I don't like it big, bushy, but I like a natural-shaped triangle.  Why?  I just do.  I like a natural-shaped triangle with just a little hair there.  ATK is a rocket site.  I mean, shaved is great, too.  Believe me, shaved, I like it.  I don't like big, hairy ones.  The gimme for ATK is kind of...  But every so often...  Like, it's one of those hot links that takes you someplace else.  I'll try to see if I can find it.  Now it's linking me to some porno biz.  I like a bulge. 
[02:22:00]  I like white panties with...  I want to...  I want it to look like our cunt is robbing the joints.  It's like a fucking...  A big bulge with, like, shapes in it.  I like that.  I want it to look like the grizzle that comes off a fucking massive steak.  Just weird, chewy, and fucking fatty-looking.  Yeah.  It's a little not dirty, though.  Seriously, that's fucking hot.  I don't know what I would do with it in real life, but I love to look at it online.  Wow.  Maybe it's the freak value.  I'm like, I've never seen that.  I like freak show stuff, so...  Totally. 
[02:22:30]  But not in a way where I'm like, I'm looking down at these people.  I'm like, that's so different.  It's beautiful.  Celebrate your diversity.  Put something in there, would you?  Man, no.  Off the air, if you give me an email address, I'll send...  By the way, we've been surfing for the last 15 minutes, and E-Rock gave us nothing.  Dude, I've never seen...  We're looking at Misty Rain.  He is the worst.  I told him to look up Ronda's playpen.  He spells Ronda, R-O-N.  Right.  Well, he's looking at Misty Rain right now.  I guess that's a porn star, but we're looking at Misty Rain in the fucking rainforest pictures. 
[02:23:00]  You know who that is, Misty Rain?  She doesn't do it anymore.  She's out of the business.  But remember Ronda?  There was a girl named Ronda many years ago who had a big, meaty pussy.  She had a giant clit.  It was a huge clit.  Wait, I remember her.  That was a cock, man.  Here's another one.  You viewed two.  She was the brunette with the short hair.  She was beautiful.  You viewed two dot com.  Y-U-V-U-T-U dot com.  That's like another porno tube or red tube.  All the places that you can watch.  Like a good three minutes, five minutes for free. 
[02:23:30]  And that's all you need, right?  It's all about free.  Not you.  What is it?  What kind of...  Is it Y-U-V-U-T-U?  Y-U-V-U-T-U-B-E.  Not T...  Not B-E.  Y-U-T-U-V-U dot com.  Do you get massages?  I do, but not the full release kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  No, believe me.  I'm in the same boat.  I've never had one of those.  Is that...  Have you...  You've had one of those, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you live by them.  No, I've had enough regular ones, too, but...  Is what... 
[02:24:00]  Is...  You just go in with an understanding, like, sooner or later, it's going to come to, you're  going to jerk me off?  Not always, no.  I mean, in some places, you know, it's going to be legit, but, yeah, other times, like,  you kind of know, and then there's that moment where you're not sure.  The best ones are the ones where you're not sure, so she'll be massaging you, and, like,  they'll work down on your legs, and they avoid the area, but then all of a sudden,  the finger brushes the back of your balls a millisecond, and you're like, ah, it's amazing  to hide you.  I don't think I could do it.  I'm too...  Jesus.  I'm too...  I'm too insecure.  About what?  I don't...  Well, number one, I'm fat. 
[02:24:30]  Number two, I don't have a big dick, so I don't even want them seeing it.  Really?  Yeah, I wear...  I wear fucking shorts and underwear when I get a massage, and they're like, you can take  that off and lay under the towel.  I'm like, that's all right.  Why?  I need layers.  The beautiful thing, it doesn't matter to them.  They don't give a fuck.  Nah.  Well, I want it to matter to them, Jimmy.  But they don't...  That's the beauty of it.  They're disconnected.  They'll just jerk you off.  As long as you blow a load, they don't care.  Oh, I couldn't even...  I'm married, dude.  I couldn't do that.  Dude, there's an old lady blowing some dude on this site.  On You of You, too?  Yeah.  Isn't it great?  And they put the little nationality flag from where these videos are from, so you're 
[02:25:00]  like, hey, this couple's from Canada.  Hey, this couple is from Germany.  German couple is a very weird man.  Yeah, yeah.  They're really weird stuff.  We've come to the conclusion that conquered nations have, like, these weird fetishes.  Yeah.  Weird stuff, because Japan is just...  It's not like the size of Essen.  It's just shit where you're like...  Out of control.  Yeah.  What's that?  I never thought of doing that.  What are they doing?  Anybody fucking...  Anybody should ever think of doing that.  And Japan is another one where they just...  You know, I love how they pixelate the pubic hair, yet they will show a girl as a fudge 
[02:25:30]  fountain in a fucking bathtub, just shitting upside down all over herself.  What is that?  But don't cover up the pubes.  When you won't let people see pubes, they're like, well, I guess we got to get off on watching  people shit on one another.  What was the website that we were looking at one day where the girl had a shit hat that  was so heavy she couldn't keep her head up?  Oh, yeah.  A shit hat.  Hey, can you type in poobutton.com? 
[02:26:00]  Are you looking for a shit site?  No, but there's this one that somebody just sent me the other day, and it's one of those  like, send it to somebody.  I think it's poobutton.com.  Now, just press the poobutton.  All right.  We're pressing the poobutton.  It makes a noise, and then hold on.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  A fellow named Josh sent it.  Oh, damn.  And they play it back slow-mo.  How horrible is that?  And look at the chick's expression, the one who's getting shit on. 
[02:26:30]  You can tell she's like, this really stinks.  She is covered with shit.  Poobutton.com.  It's one of those things where you send somebody the fucking link, and they do it at work.  Wait, push on the poobutton again, please.  If you could hear it, it makes a noise.  It goes, and then all of a sudden, this video kicks in out of nowhere.  Dude, that's just pure comedy today, man.  I don't see anything sexual about it, man.  That is hilarious.  Watch the one girl who's the bestiever.  Watch her face.  You see how she's like, this smells. 
[02:27:00]  She looks the way she should look with that fucking poochie.  But she's trying to make it look kind of sexy, but she's just looking at her face.  And also, it's like, what is jetting out of that other woman's face?  That's a guy, by the way.  That's not a woman.  That's a guy.  That's a guy shitting on her.  That's a guy shitting on her.  And might I say, that guy's got a really nice feminine ass.  What a cool customer he is.  He's cool as a cucumber.  He's bent over, and you can see his watch.  And he is just shitting on that girl, and he's not fucking moving a muscle.  It was in between soft and a harsh shit. 
[02:27:30]  It was a wonderful shit.  I mean, it was like a...  It was like a dude who took some Metamucil the night before.  Yeah.  He figured it out.  He figured out what would be the ultimate shit.  What do you need it to eat?  What do you need it to drink?  Yeah, that would be so nice to just sit on the bowl and do one like that.  Yeah, it don't happen like that unless you take some Metamucil.  Oh, my God.  I'm sending Eric to one.  It's funny.  And I'll give the name out in a second, because you may actually crash it, where they show  chicks taking shits that are just beyond comprehension.  I thought it was fake.  I'm like, this is a ghost.  Massive, like, massive shits? 
[02:28:00]  Awful.  It's awful.  Wait.  Wait, dude.  There's got to be...  Go down.  There's got to be a video.  Go all the way down.  There's got to be a video.  There's one chick.  Is she farming?  The fucking logs some of these chicks are.  It's fucking mind-bending.  Look at the one on the right.  It's horrible.  You got a picture?  You got a picture?  No.  We're watching...  I'm not tied into that one.  We're watching...  Just enter the site.  Just find a video that gives you kind of a... 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  There has to be one.  Free area.  Go to the free area, you goose.  And I'll give the site out in a minute so you at home...  You're a goose?  Yeah.  You're a goose.  There has to be one.  But the...  See, now, I would like...  This doesn't get me off, but I look at it because I find it interesting.  That's what I said, Kevin.  Remember, how often do you ever get to see someone taking a shit?  Look at the one she's holding.  That is great stuff.  They got the...  Oh, I thought it was a shit calendar. 
[02:29:00]  Look at the...  Hold on.  Look at this one.  I love this one.  Oh, my God.  It just makes me laugh.  Wow.  It's fucking...  It looks like her fucking...  Her asshole has a beard.  I popped that on that.  It's only a picture.  They won't show you a video for free, I don't think.  But that's the thing.  It's like, that's something that we all have in common.  We all fucking shit.  But you can't talk about it because people get real uptight.  Look at that.  It's massive.  She's petting it like it's a little dog shit.  That Mila Pearlman is good. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  Look at that.  That looks like a hand grenade coming out of her.  It's got like all the...  Like the pineapple, the classic pineapple hand grenade.  Looks like a corn dog.  That looks like it's going in more than coming out.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what they fucking feed these girls.  They must not shit for like a week.  Someone is saying twogirlsonecup.com.  Oh, you got that one?  Oh, no.  Twogirlsonecup.com.  Twogirlsonecup.com.  What now?  We're looking at shit videos.  Why not? 
[02:30:00]  We're sharing with our audience.  Oh, my God.  It just makes me laugh.  It is really funny.  There's nothing...  I don't find it sexual at all.  From the age of fucking two years old, poo will always be funny.  It's hysterical.  And if people are smearing it on themselves, it's something so out there and disgusting  that you just laugh.  Is this two cups, one girl?  A different website.  Same video.  All right.  Okay.  Well, it looks like we got a little ways to go here.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:30]  Holy shit.  Wait, wait.  It gets better.  Oh, come on.  Heavens.  Dude.  One girl just took a dump in a glass, made it look like a fucking ice cream cone, and then  they both went to town on it.  I guarantee you that.  She's juggling it with her time.  That's Brazilian.  Dude, that shit came out and filled up that...  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Now they're kissing.  Oh, my God.  The shit filled up that cup like you were at Carvel.  Now they're puking up the shit. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait, the one girl puked the shit onto the cup of shit, and the other girl licked it  off.  This is really bad.  Julia Roberts was puking into her mouth.  These girls are getting a hundred bucks?  They said nothing.  They need to pay these girls a lot of money.  Look at all that shit.  The one girl threw up shit into the mouth of the other girl.  That is heinous.  That could be one of the most disgusting...  Let's go back to the beginning, though, because the highlight is that chick filling a cup.  Yeah, the filling of the cup is probably the best part. 
[02:31:30]  I've never seen shit explode from halfway.  I don't see where that's disgusting.  It just makes me laugh really hard.  The cup gets filled.  Watch the cup.  Watch the cup.  Watch it fast.  It's an instantaneous filling of a huge cup.  Wow.  Oh, did she dump that right out?  Did she get you in and out the door that fast at Carvel?  Look at how fast that fills, man.  And look at the other girl's hand from the weight of it.  She almost...  It was like the kickback of a fucking shotgun.  It was like, oh, I wasn't prepared. 
[02:32:00]  Them looking at like an ice cream cone.  Eric, what are you looking at?  Get back on that screen.  Let Eric do this.  Eric, what's wrong?  No, no, make me do it.  Eric, come on.  Eric, go watch the video.  This is the piece where she was juggling it with her tongue, man.  That was insane.  Eric, you gotta look because you need to work the video for us.  Go forward, go forward, go forward.  Eric.  Eric has to watch.  Here it comes.  This right here.  She's juggling with a tongue.  She's working it with her mouth like you...  Oh.  E-Rock.  See, why is it... 
[02:32:30]  I can't...  Hold on.  Watch.  She's gonna work it and now she's swallowed it.  Oh.  She ate poo.  E-Rock, look, you're missing the kissing.  Ah, the kissing.  They're making out.  Wait, people are killing us.  They all want to go there.  Go to cupchicks.com.  Cupchicks.  The one girl puked shit onto the other cup of shit and the other girl licked it all.  Almost like, may I have some jimmies?  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Dude, it's just...  And then she just vomited.  See, there's nothing gross.  That just makes me laugh out loud.  This is Brazilian.  I guarantee it.  But who finds this... 
[02:33:00]  Yeah?  Who finds this sexually arousing?  Jimmy finds it a bit depending on the video.  You don't find that arousing.  No.  I've done a lot of that stuff.  No.  I could jerk off to some of that.  Not that particular one.  That's too graphic for me.  Like, the shit's too soft and awful.  It just looks like shit.  But I'm jerking off to bizarre stuff like that.  The filling up of the cup is the funniest part.  Like, how much more bizarre or less bizarre than this?  Like, a chick shitting into another chick's mouth, I could jerk off to it.  Really?  You're actually losing it.  And sometimes, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  It's either really disgusting to me or I'll jerk off to it.  Look at that.  That's the part that'll...  Yeah, that part makes you cringe.  I'm going to take that to the grave, man.  That part where she's juggling with her tongue.  You've got to kind of do this with your mouth when you're watching stuff.  There's a physical reaction to that.  I hope she has no sense of smell whatsoever.  Yeah, the Brazilian girls, they get because they don't pay them much.  You're right.  They're very poverty-stricken.  That's what I'm saying.  It's fucking nuts.  You'll pay Julie Roberts $20 million to do a movie.  Each one of those girls deserve at least a million dollars for what they did with that  waste. 
[02:34:00]  Someone is suggesting Toilet Sherry.  All right.  S-H-E-R-R-I.  He'll probably spell it fucking...  By the way, people are saying congrats on Reaper.  Thank you.  Yeah, Reaper...  Hold on.  In between shit websites, why don't we do something normal?  Colin in Tampa, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say, ONA, every time you have Smith on, I download it from Audible.  I want to congratulate you on getting the best Gen X director that we've ever had.  And congratulate Mr. Smith on his two TV pilots. 
[02:34:30]  Thank you, sir.  I have rules.  Kevin does rule.  Well, we don't say it.  It's just cool that he just comes in and hangs out like a dude, man.  Where else do you go where they're like, hey, let's watch shit videos?  Let's watch shit videos.  I don't even do this at home.  I got to be on a locked door.  It's like we're doing commentary to a shit DVD.  Totally.  You can download this track later on and play it opposite two girls in a cup.  Only radio gives you the excuse of like, oh, it was brutal today. 
[02:35:00]  We had to look at shit videos for an hour.  Who knew Kevin had a meat pussy fetish?  No kidding.  I do.  I'm a big Lurie Lurie fan.  Again, I've never encountered it in real life, but man.  That's one of the questions that don't really come up on those college tours.  All right, listen.  Let's be surprised.  All right, we got Toilet Sherry.  Do you want her to, you want her, she's looking like, go to this one.  It looks like she's bobbing for shit in the toilet.  Whose shit is it, though?  I don't know.  Oh, Sherry.  Does it matter?  Like if it was hers or someone else's, it would fill your face in the toilet. 
[02:35:30]  Well, if it's a guy that shits on her, that's repulsive to me.  Right.  A woman shitting, I can at least watch.  A guy shitting in a woman's mouth, I've seen a lot of those that are German.  They're terrible.  I love Norton.  He's got bizarre lines, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's free.  There we go.  That's a tiny window.  Stolen Car Films presents.  Wow.  Oh, they are smearing shit all over that girl's, all over her tits.  Holy crap, this is Toilet Sherry 4.  Yeah.  So many unanswered. 
[02:36:00]  Unanswered questions.  Well, if they don't show some...  Well, they've had, like, what?  Five Harry Potters?  Why couldn't they have four Toilet Sally's?  Oh, God, her face.  Like she was at the chocolate ice cream.  Chocolate ice cream eating contest.  Oh, God.  Now, here's my question.  In order to do a full feature, it's got to be, what, maybe a half hour?  I don't know.  Some of them are very long.  Oh, they do so many... 
[02:36:30]  She looks disgusted.  Is it one session?  Like, they all sit down over the course of an hour?  Or is it multiple days?  Because it's not like you can shit at will.  The Brazilian ones will have, like, ten girls, and they're all giggling.  And then there's, like, one or two slaves that they all piss on, and then they shit on.  And then a lot of times they'll spit and puke on them, too, on the floor.  I mean, it's vile.  It really is.  I tell you, dude, that is fucking ancient Rome right there.  Yeah.  In a world where it's just like, we've run out of shit to keep us interested, we have  to watch people fucking shit on other people's mouths. 
[02:37:00]  I'm trying to find...  Hold on.  Oh, look, Jimmy.  Giving Iraq the information.  I know.  And the whispered tones.  It's almost like a game show.  It's spelled Brazilian right, too.  Oh, boy.  This could be ugly.  Is this Brazilian fart porn?  No, I don't like fart porn.  I think it's all fake.  It is fake.  It's fart porn.  Brazilian fart porn is literally like one girl bent over, farting in the face of another  girl, and then the girl who she farted on has to inhale it.  Muse introduced me to that.  He's like, you've got to see this. 
[02:37:30]  And it's two pretty girls, and one's bent over, and you just hear...  And then the other girl is like going...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, that's great.  But it must arouse somebody, because they made it.  Yeah, sure.  All right, where are we at, Jimmy?  I'm trying to find a site.  I looked at a lot of these sites.  I just can't remember the one.  It's been so many years since I've...  I haven't looked at these sites in a long time.  You and me should go into biz, dude.  We should open up a porn site.  Man.  With the things that we like. 
[02:38:00]  Because there's probably other degenerates out there.  They're not expensive to run.  Just toast a bunch of shit.  It's hard to compete with them, though.  There's so many of them now.  There's so much free shit.  That's the thing.  Isn't it...  What I always find amazing about online pornography and online...  And again, when I say pornography, I don't mean like the porno biz.  I mean fucking...  Yeah.  ...an idiot who talks some fucking bigger idiot into letting him tape or do something heinous.  Right.  In a world of a process of elimination, sooner or later, I'm bound to see somebody I know. 
[02:38:30]  Right?  True.  Yeah.  Hasn't happened yet.  No.  Never once.  I mean, because anytime I go to Pick Hunter, I never see the same fucking broad twice unless  it's like a Raven Riley or some name you know.  That's true.  There's just a lot of fresh faces every day, dude.  Every day.  And I'm like, one day I've got to see somebody who I went to school with or got to recognize  from town.  It's never happened yet.  But they're a never-ending fucking stream of people who are willing to take their gear 
[02:39:00]  off.  Just forever.  It's been that way forever.  Just like one after a parade.  A cavalcade.  And pretty, by the way.  Yeah.  Like, it's not like, you know, well, what other choice they have.  Pretty fucking girls willing to take their clothes off.  But the internet is...  There really is.  It's so extreme.  There's just...  There's so much competition.  You got to do something crazy to make anything.  I mean, if you're Belladonna, you're making money on your website.  But if you're fucking just an average porn chick, who gives a shit? 
[02:39:30]  Right.  Why would anybody pay for it when, especially now, there's so much free stuff?  That guy's a fake.  He stinks.  Don't look at him.  What, the guy that puts his whole head in?  That's bullshit.  Yeah.  He's like a big fake plastic pussy.  It's horrendous.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the dude who puts...  Oh, he's terrible.  Fartfrazil.com.  That's the one Kevin's talking about.  Tap, tap, tap.  I want to see that, yeah.  And the music is killer.  But also, it's just like the fart...  Like, it's clearly...  Like, it's a fart noise that you would use on the radio. 
[02:40:00]  Like, they lay it over the fucking video to make it sound like the chick's fart.  I mean, no chick farts like that.  Although there are...  Like, it's a gentle breeze.  I wish I could remember the company.  There was one Brazilian company that what they would do...  Funny fart videos.  Come on, dude.  It was so hot.  You want me to do this?  Go to the world right there.  It was all domination.  And the one woman would dominate the other girls and she would make her smell her ass.  And then sometimes they would piss in her mouth.  Two girls, like, they were holding the other girl's nose. 
[02:40:30]  They were spitting in her mouth.  It's really fucking hot until it gets disgusting.  Until.  But, I mean, up until that point, it's like a real domination thing.  Like that.  Go to funny adult humor, maybe.  I'm telling you, did you enter Brazilian fart porn into Google?  That's a good one.  E-Rock is the worst.  E-Rock is terrible at this.  He makes a face.  I don't want to steal a dude's job, but let me tell you something.  Yeah, really?  I'm going to go over there and just punch him in the head. 
[02:41:00]  How could you not find shit movies on the internet?  Are you a fucking...  What, are you a rookie?  Eric, you're terrible.  Are you religious?  Where are you talking to me to go?  Is it really?  Did you enter...  That's about Brazil, but just enter into Google, Brazilian fart porn.  Exactly.  Brazilian fart porn.  I don't know if...  Should have put it in quotes.  I don't know if you spell Brazilian.  I'm sure he didn't.  Two Zs.  There you go.  Click on it.  Fart porn.  Fart porn.  What does it say?  Brazilian fart porn. 
[02:41:30]  How about...  Warmy, rigid.  Why?  What the...  Yeah, I've seen the fart porn.  It's terrible.  Fartbrazil.com.  I should just bring in one of my fucking hard drives.  Here it is.  There it is.  Look at her face as she inhales it.  Can you get the sound?  Yep.  Oh, my God.  Go back.  Her hair moves.  Go back, E-Rock, before I beat you.  Her hair moves.  Her fucking hair...  No, all the way back.  Her hair blows.  Watch.  Her hair blows like a breeze has hit it. 
[02:42:00]  It's fucking...  Nice music.  And the music...  Wait.  Watch.  Wait.  No, no.  Not this one.  It's the second one.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Watch.  Her fucking hair blew.  Like...  Oh, it's so great.  Oh, that's so gross.  They're fake.  Well, listen to this sound effects. 
[02:42:30]  It's just laid on top to augment the experience, but I gotta believe that some of them are actually  important.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I gotta believe it, man.  Way like I gotta believe that Jesus existed.  I gotta believe.  I've had a dumb fart in my face.  It's just kind of disgusting.  Yeah.  Oh, she's pulling away.  But these chicks, man.  Look.  That's a...  They like it.  That's right there.  At least they're acting like it.  Oh, she's turning her head a little bit.  I think it's...  It's real.  They just, like you said, lay over the farts out. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, because they don't need to fart, really.  I mean, they really don't need to.  The asshole puckers...  In order to fucking blow the hair back, one of them had to...  Yeah.  A fan got turned on.  It's all fucking CGI.  Don't ruin it, dude.  You're like a kid on the playground that's just like, Santa Claus don't exist.  I want to believe in Brazil.  Yeah.  There's enough real stuff on the net where you don't need to.  And they never speak English, because like in most English, like, you know, Western civilizations,  there was a great one in England they shut down.  This chick fucking Lucy and this other woman.  Lucy and Mac and something. 
[02:43:30]  It was two girls and a guy, and they shut them down in England.  She was sexy.  There's one video where this chick Lucy is sitting there with her legs up in the air,  and she's just shitting onto the floor, and it's awful, but yet you're like, this is  a sexy fucking woman.  Are you kidding?  No, she was sexy.  Even if they're really attractive, it never occurs to me as sexy, but I do find it just  on a human level, just interesting to watch a woman take a shit.  Because I know, how often do you ever see that?  A lot, online.  But in real life, it's like, even like if your old lady's comfortable enough to leave 
[02:44:00]  the door open, it's not like you've got a transparent bowl, and you're watching as  it comes out.  You know, you're just, you're hearing noises, but like seeing something come out of something  else, it's like watching birth, kind of.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, we got to announce Miss Palatol after the break.  Oh, remember that?  A little cliffhanger from Friday, we got to get taken care of.  Kevin Smith in studio, Letterman tomorrow night?  Uh-oh.  Letterman tomorrow night.  And do you want to sell this book or not? 
[02:44:30]  You're being challenged?  I do, I do, but I just hate, I don't like to come in and whore shit, but I'm selling  the book.  You're giving us great radio, you know, get a plug in.  My Boring Ass Life, it's the uncomfortably candid diary of Kevin Smith, and it's a really  thick, like you didn't like just shitty phone it in.  And this book is almost 500 pages, small font, no picture.  It's just like a real, it's like a real read.  I mean.  It looks like the Bible, kind of.  Yes.  The print is that small.  It's just unbelievable.  Although this is probably more historically accurate. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, and his statement.  The man.  This is very good, though.  By the way, Ben from Jersey, just curious, what type of virus protection do you guys  run?  Yeah, really.  You're just loading up the computer with all kinds of good shit.  This is one of those moments where I'm just going to be like, well, I got a Mac, so they  never get virus.  Yeah.  And I'm going to believe that.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's true, but like I heard that once somewhere, I'm like, all right,  I'm virus.  Yeah, I don't know why I don't.  The people that write viruses and put them up there.  They'd rather do it for the masses.  Yeah, they don't really.  That might change over time, but, and I'm sure there's some Mac viruses out there, but 
[02:45:30]  they really don't get them.  It's like if you were going to bring down a coffee chain, would you go after the coffee  bean and tea leaf or Starbucks?  Exactly.  You'd go after bucks.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This part so we can start the bit.  Oh, it stinks so bad.  What the fuck?  Uh-oh.  What should I say to that?  Oh, my God.  What did they, um?  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait, wait.  Before you go to that Mitch Beck bit.  Mark that one down, boys. 
[02:46:00]  That sounded like an acid reflux burp.  Oh, you want to play games?  Yeah, I'll play games.  Oh.  Points, Jimmy.  I play in the majors.  You go play in the little cow league.  Oh.  Stay tuned for another edition of the fart game on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I farted.  And we're back on XM Satellite Radio.  So I was saying, uh, the UN is in, uh...  Yeah.  The UN is in session for the next, what? 
[02:46:30]  Two weeks?  Three weeks?  How long do they do that day?  What they're trying to do, they're meeting, uh, as a general assembly so they can stamp out  that Brazilian porn stuff.  The Brazilian porn?  They're trying to clean up the porn industry.  This pal talk, I wouldn't get anything done, dude.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  I've gone to a show the whole time where people are just standing there naked in front of a  camera live and holding up notes and whatnot.  It's given us the opportunity to, uh, bring people into the show that you normally wouldn't 
[02:47:00]  because they live too far or do that.  Like, we've had people do the nudity is, like, top.  That's the best.  Phenomenal.  We've had people do things, though, that, like, if they would come into the studio to do  them and we'd describe it, they could do it from home now.  We could describe it.  It's still radio, so.  Let me jump in here, though, because, uh, in Kevin's book, he describes being on our  show, watching a couple have sex on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  It made his book.  Oh, really nice.  Yeah.  It did.  Oh, that's right.  That was, uh...  I wrote about it.  Yeah, I was, like, you were seeing the windows.  You came in for a regular interview. 
[02:47:30]  Next thing you know, we sat around for 20 minutes watching a couple have sex.  It was almost like, it was, I mean, thank God somebody had the presence of mind every  once in a while to be like, those boobs are nice.  Otherwise, it would have been dead air.  Yeah, just dead air.  Because you'd see a bunch of people staring.  Going, da.  That's what happens.  You do kind of lose it.  And believe me, I'm not looking at gift horse in the mouth, but why do it?  Exhibitionism?  Um, yeah, a little of that.  Well, the couple we watched, they're swingers and they're, you know, they're advertising.  Really?  Oh, that's who that was. 
[02:48:00]  That's right.  Yeah, they're advertising.  Are they trying to trap you guys in their...  No, no, no.  There's other people with their cams all across America watching them as well.  So, speaking of Pal Talk, we got to announce Miss Pal Talk.  Oh, we had Miss Pal Talk contest on Friday.  Is it a girl up in the upper left-hand corner?  And man, let me tell you, they were doing whatever they could to try to win some of these  girls.  Oh, what was the one?  One girl was...  Deliver Us from Eva.  Yeah.  Took a load on the chest.  She was giving a blowjob to her boyfriend or whoever she was with. 
[02:48:30]  Father.  Kid brother.  That was kid brother.  And took a load right on the chest.  What a trooper.  Yeah.  Wait, what kind of load?  A load of jizz.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, just...  That's all the shit talk.  Right there.  Oh, well, that would have...  Well, now that would have clinched it right there.  Instant winner.  Literally clinched.  Yeah, totally.  Yeah.  Clinch.  My benefits.  Her ass is fantastic.  Who...  Is that the girl in the upper left-hand corner?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's sitting there on her stomach, and you can see her little hiney in the background. 
[02:49:00]  Just lovely.  Why does she keep the underwear on, though, if she's already topless?  She's a goose.  She's a goose.  She knows.  You just want to nuzzle it.  Make animal noises.  I want to make duck noises into her asshole.  So, who won Miss Pal Talk?  Well, third place was Baby Girl.  Third place.  Third place.  And what does she do to earn the honor?  Huh?  What does she do to earn the honor?  She's on every day.  She looks hot.  And she flashes, and she's just hot.  Yeah.  That's pretty much where... 
[02:49:30]  Congratulations.  ...where that comes in.  Did they get a trophy or anything, or it's just...  $500, which, you know, let's be honest, was a bit of a cheap prize.  Wasn't happy about the prize.  But it seems like most of these cats would do this stuff for free anyway, so...  True, true.  And they got bragging rights, you know.  Totally.  Amongst themselves.  Oh, but does the money only go to the first place winner?  I think so, yeah.  You know what they should do with their money is give it to the animal shelter.  Oh, fucker.  Second place was Deliver Us from Eva. 
[02:50:00]  And what'd she do?  She was the load in the chest.  Yeah.  Well, she also took it up the ass, it looked like.  Eva, did you take it in the shitter?  Which one's Eva?  She can nod.  She's in the bottom left.  No, she had sex on camp.  She blew her...  Was it her husband?  Do we know?  I'm not sure who the guy was.  She's typing furiously.  And then she got, uh...  I'm trying to...  No, just the who?  Who is it?  She just took it in the vagina, not the ass.  She just...  I'd like to make a clear play. 
[02:50:30]  Iraq, say that again?  Yeah.  How funny is that?  She said she just took it in the vagina, not the ass.  Oh, that's too bad.  This show is insane.  What...  Who was the guy she was with?  Was it your husband?  Is she married?  Do we know?  She keeps holding up her hands like, I don't know.  She has no idea who he was.  Oh, is he just a Randy?  Is that it?  It's her husband.  Oh, it's her husband.  Right on.  Okay.  Is he even a fan of the show?  Let's hope so.  I hope he knows the camera was on. 
[02:51:00]  Who better?  She's amazing.  Who came in first place now?  Couldn't see anything, though.  You could see it was his ass cheeks.  It was a terrible blowjob.  Because you always need a third in the room, dude.  First place?  You need somebody to operate the camera and the lights.  That's simple.  First place?  You mean to claim the title of Miss Pal Talk  and claim the prize of $500, Opie?  Courtesy of Pal Talk?  Courtesy of Pal Talk?  Mm-hmm.  That would be...  Boy, is this exciting.  I have all kinds of sound effects, but no drum roll. 
[02:51:30]  It was indeed Flight Benefits.  Flight Benefits?  Yes.  That's her handle.  Jamie.  Yeah, she's top left.  That's her?  That's her?  Very hot girl.  She won.  Did she know she was going to win?  No.  Congratulations.  There she goes.  Wow, look at her now.  She rolls over a little.  She's got a tan, gentlemen.  She looks good.  Gives a little rollover.  There it is.  Is she crying?  There she is. 
[02:52:00]  Miss Pal Talk.  What did she do to earn it?  I'm sorry.  I missed that part.  She was showing her tits.  She was being pretty naked and putting whipped cream on herself.  I think she actually had sex on camera.  You gave it to the girl who did watch sex on camera.  No, no, you know what it is?  Isn't that really something?  I think also it's a cumulative thing.  Because the liver of Stamiva is very good, but Baby Girl is also very good.  And Flight Benefits is on here every day, being hot, showing her tits.  It's kind of like we gave her like, it's like Pacino.  He got fucked for Godfather 2, so they had to give him the nod for Scent of a Woman.  Well, that's pretty much what that was. 
[02:52:30]  I would go with Jeremy Irons, getting passed over for Dead Ringers and instead getting the Oscar for Reversal of Fortune.  Well, of course.  I wouldn't have done that one.  That's the Tony version of what you said.  But you're right.  Absolutely.  I'm not saying Deliver Us from Eva didn't deserve.  Right.  She was no Art Carney in Harry and Tompkins.  Is Flight Benefits taking congratulatory calls now?  It looks that way.  Yes, people are calling, congratulating her.  Do you have two of those underpants, or does it just the underpants stay on? 
[02:53:00]  I don't know if she throws the puss.  I'm trying to remember if...  It's an odd line to draw when we're just like, I'm okay.  No, she's had them off, I think, when she's been asleep, and then you just, you know, see her ass, I think.  I don't remember.  God, the internet is so good.  It really is.  Yeah, it's really nothing.  I can't get work done.  I'm trying to write something, and I can't get work done when I have an internet connection.  You know what I write a lot better on planes, or when I'm fucking in a place where I have 
[02:53:30]  no internet connection, or the comedy cellar, like I'm doing a weekend there, because I  can't be looking at porn at the table, so I have to get some writing done.  But it's amazing how hard it is to cope with being a fucking sex addict, when you can just  peek at anything you want to online, man.  It's so hard.  It's like being an alcoholic, and just having a...  Like, all you're doing is eating all day, and you have a button you can push, and then beer  just pours out of it.  Like, you know what I mean?  You can have no beer in the house, push a button, and beer pours out of it.  That's what the internet is like for sex addicts.  It's fucking really tough, man. 
[02:54:00]  But thank God.  You can't get anything done.  I can't?  I would say it's better than the invention of the airplane, the automobile, life-saving  medicines.  This was...  It just cracks me up that it's supposed to be some kind of...  Video conferencing?  Yeah, like this in itself, just this program.  The whole internet is supposed to be this exchange of ideas from schools and scientists  and professors, and it just turns into LOL and things like that. 
[02:54:30]  And then this was supposed to be...  You know it was presented as, look, we can conference.  If we have a client in Japan, we can then video conference him.  It's very easy, very cheap.  We've figured out a way with the bandwidth and everything.  And it's like, yes, it's a great idea.  Okay, we'll back this.  And like that.  Naked people jerking off, porno, fucking.  It makes absolute sense to me.  Of course it does.  I mean, think about the most basic form of communication before we put together language, 
[02:55:00]  syntax, shit like that.  Yeah.  It was just, you know, that kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm just like, without even grunting, you just...  I'm sure cavemen walked around just showing her dicks.  Walking up to a girl.  You think cavemen got in trouble for using the wrong grunt?  Never.  Never?  Never, man. 
[02:55:30]  There was no such thing as the wrong grunt back then.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, big Star Wars fan, obviously.  I like Star Wars.  Did you know about the cigarette commercial that C-3PO and R2-D2 did?  It was a Don't Smoke commercial?  Yeah.  I remember this commercial.  You really do?  Totally.  R2-D2 is smoking a cigarette.  Yeah, he was smoking a cigarette, which I just...  C-3PO chastises him.  Really couldn't grasp onto it.  She's got a lightsaber.  She's competing with the...  She's like, you want to see Star Wars?  Oh, Kev.  You're a newbie to our show, man. 
[02:56:00]  She's done things with the lightsaber?  Oh, she does have a lightsaber.  I apologize.  I'm not kidding, yeah.  Yeah, because she usually does the glow stick.  Yeah, and Ashley's got a lightsaber.  Her whole bit is that she uses glow sticks.  Wow.  How many uses it?  Uh-oh.  When they start leaning back in the chair, I'm like, hello.  She puts it in her vag.  It's Jar Jar stinks.  She could probably put it in her vag in honor of Kevin Smith, I'm sure.  Would you, Eva?  I wouldn't dare ask.  Uh-oh.  Get off that computer!  Some dude just walked by. 
[02:56:30]  What the hell are you doing with the lightsaber?  All right.  Anyway, back to the commercial.  So, who's smoking R2-D2?  R2-D2 has a cigarette and C-3PO chastising them for having a cigarette.  Well, why would you chastise him?  Nothing's going to...  He's a robot.  C-3PO is uptight.  Nothing will hurt him.  And then he's got that little lame little thing that comes out to hold the cigarette.  That little arm.  That little baby arm.  That stupid arm.  I like how R2-D2 is much better in what was supposed to have been the earlier days of R2-D2. 
[02:57:00]  Like, he had trouble getting around in the first Star Wars.  And then he was flying.  Yeah.  He had rocket packs.  When they did those prequels, boy, he can get around, man.  He did all kinds of shit.  And then he's just a pile of crap.  He's older.  Yeah, he got older.  Was that it?  He got older.  Because that's what happens.  Got a little rusty.  Well, they wiped their memories at the end of the third one.  Yeah.  When they're giving to Captain Antilles, he's like, and by the way, wipe the droid's memories.  Maybe he forgot how to fly.  He forgot he can fly. 
[02:57:30]  Of the first three good, I've never seen the other three.  I've seen the original three, but I've never seen the first three.  I thought they were watchable.  You'll find a lot of people are like, they're bullshit.  He raped the franchise.  But I think they're watchable.  They're not as strong as the ones we grew up watching.  I don't like Lucas.  I think he's very overrated.  I think he did two great, great films.  Maybe a couple more.  He's literally only directed, well, up until the new Star Wars trilogy, he'd only directed  American Graffiti, Star Wars, THX 1138, and that was it, right? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  He didn't direct Empire.  He didn't direct Jedi.  Yeah, he just produced them, right?  Produced.  Yeah, so fuck him.  Or came up with a story.  Stupid little shit.  They only wiped three PO's memory, sir.  What?  They only wiped three PO's memory, not R2's memory.  How do you know that?  Because they say wiped the protocol droid's memory.  Ew.  Really?  Are you sure?  Pretty sure.  Really?  I don't know that they made the...  No, I don't think they made...  They distinguished between the two.  I thought they said just wiped the droid's memory.  Right now, vaginas all over the country are drying up.  I think they made the distinction. 
[02:58:30]  I'm pretty sure.  You gotta appreciate that the show goes from shit videos.  Yeah, exactly.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Two dudes.  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  How sheltered they are by almost getting into a fist fight over which droid got its mind  wiped.  I thought both of them did, too.  No, we're not.  We're not.  We're too tired.  We are.  Fucking thank God.  We were up all night.  All right.  Here's...  Enough to watch now.  Can we hear it?  Do we have volume in the room?  Yeah, here's the cigarette commercial.  You got headphones?  I haven't seen it in a while.  Oh, I gotta listen to it here. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It's one thing I don't like about radio.  Yeah, the headphones suck.  R2, put that down.  Cigarettes are dangerous.  Oh, smoking isn't grown up.  It's very foolish.  Oh?  Because it's a dirty habit.  It has dreadful things to your lungs, and it's very bad for your heart.  Well, I know I don't have one, but humans do, and I think we should set a good example.  Oh, that's right.  Well done, R2. 
[02:59:30]  Please, don't smoke.  See, the translation, they're supposed to have subtitles on this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And what...  Could you go back to the beginning for a second, because you missed a line here.  Oh, boy.  No, no, but I remember the subtitles in the original.  Yeah, I remember.  Oh, okay.  Hmm.  See, he chastises him.  Hmm.  All right, no need to hear it.  Yeah, where's the sound? 
[03:00:00]  What are you doing?  R2?  Oh, forget it.  He shit all over his bit, man.  He had a good bit going.  Yeah.  He had everything going.  Timing's everything.  And...  He was very confident about his bit.  Oh, my...  Like, sold us on it?  Like, oh, really?  Sometimes?  You could be the worst at a computer.  I don't know...  I want to shoot you.  What do you push the buttons with your fucking big toes and your nose?  You know why?  It's the PC room, bitch.  Yeah, it is.  If these were Max, this never would have happened.  Don't point at me.  He needed the video. 
[03:00:30]  I gotta agree with you.  I needed the video with the audio.  He's looking at me, because I played the audio, but Jimmy had a bit that he needed to look  at the video.  Let's pretend it didn't happen.  So, if you're playing the video, then you would have to sync up the audio along with  it, fat boy.  That's right.  Rock the bit again.  Oh.  Rock the bit again, Jim.  That's not gonna work.  But I was gonna...  Here's what the subtitles were, had we had timing.  Yeah.  All right.  R2?  Where are you?  R2? 
[03:01:00]  R2?  R2?  You're on fire!  R2-D2, you've found a cigarette.  Well, I don't think smoking is grown up at all.  And the subtitle is gonna be, I'm a robot, you cunt.  And then I was gonna continue improv-ing with the robot saying things, but it's just not.  Ah, but it just doesn't.  I'm glad I listened to it, though, because he says, R2-D2, you found a cigarette. 
[03:01:30]  Found a cigarette.  He's not smoking it.  He makes it very clear that the little droid has found a cigarette.  Speaking of droids, let's go to CokeLogic.  He's grown up.  CokeLogic.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Kevin Smith there.  Very, uh...  How are you, sir?  Speak to you.  I am awesome.  I love your movies.  Nice to be spoken to.  Thank you.  I have to, I have to, uh, go along with, uh, Big Kev here.  It was, uh, only R, or 3PO that got wiped.  That means, uh, R2...  Is that what he said?  He said just wipe, wipe the protocols, protocols? 
[03:02:00]  I'm sorry, I haven't slept.  The protocol droids?  Protocol droids.  Yeah, that's why 3PO kind of freaks out and R2, like, lets out a little bleep to laugh  at him like, ha-ha, asshole.  But, uh...  Really, it wasn't more like a, boo.  Yeah, that...  Because he's gonna hang out with a dude who doesn't remember shit.  Like, you'd, it'd be like, you know, you came in one day and they wiped fucking his  mind out.  And you're like, hey, man, we gotta do our bits.  And you're like, what's a bit?  I don't even know what you're talking about. 
[03:02:30]  I don't even know why I'm here.  Why did I even come here?  Yeah.  For sure.  I thought for sure you would've heard that on my show, Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  Oh!  Wow.  Oh, I see.  It's a plug.  It's a plug.  All right, I gotcha.  I'll follow him.  I didn't, uh, didn't hear that.  By the way, we need more Big Kev interviews.  Yes.  Big Kev interviews, uh, no disrespect, but they rule with their atrociousness.  I can't get enough of his fucking interviews.  They are the best.  Hi, I'm a Big Kev.  You know, and they're always like, it's like a 30-second thing. 
[03:03:00]  My favorite Big Kev interview was with Samuel Jackson.  Oh, God.  That one is...  Can we get that?  Please.  I, I, I lost knowledge about  Samuel Jackson from that interview.  That's impossible.  I, I actually,  the knowledge of him went away.  It was that insightful.  A lot of people ask you if we saw the Star Wars Family Guy last night.  I did not see it.  I thought we talked about that already.  I didn't either.  I DVR'd everything and watch it.  We, we DVR'd that one.  Do you know what was really cute though in Star Wars was the Ewoks. 
[03:03:30]  I thought that was, I'm like, you know what, George Lucas really is, like, that's what  I want to see, the Ewoks.  The Ewoks are kind of fuzzy and cute and stuff.  Indefensible, sir.  No, they were adorable.  And I'm like, that's what I want.  Shut up.  You don't think that.  But I did.  I thought it was the cutest.  You're doing the Jimmy, I like this, but I really don't because I like being the idiot  in the room.  I did like, I thought that George Lucas, what a way to make the third film. 
[03:04:00]  A little Ewoks, how adorable.  Do you know what it was supposed to be?  It was supposed to be a planet full of Wookiees.  Yeah.  And he chickened out the last second and he was just like, you know what, probably  be better to do a planet full of teddy bears.  Yeah.  Then years later when he did Revenge of the Sith, third one.  They went to the planet full of Wookiees and they showed the Wookiees at war.  Well, also harder to sell Wookiee toys when you've already got a Wookiee toy.  See, if you create a new toy, you can sell that.  And that's why I did test him.  Sinister. 
[03:04:30]  Did everyone here grow up on the East Coast?  You grew up on the East Coast?  Sure.  Where?  Long Island.  Where'd you grow up?  Jersey.  Where?  What part?  North Brunswick.  Right on.  So like by Rutgers?  About a mile from Cook College.  Wow.  You?  Huntington, Long Island, yeah.  Do you guys remember the 430 movie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Go to YouTube, pull up.  Just enter in YouTube, the 430 movie.  Oh, boy.  When was the last time you saw the opening credits of the 430 movie?  That's a while ago.  I once surfed from one day on the web, found it, and it fucking took me back, man. 
[03:05:00]  Sometimes those things, you just hear like a sound or a commercial or one of those jingles  and go, oh, man.  Oh, there was one.  I don't remember.  I really don't remember that.  Here it is.  Okay.  Turn it up.  Oh, my God.  Remember that shit?  Oh, wow.  Right?  Look at that.  Yeah.  Suddenly, you're like seven years old again.  It's ape week.  It's fucking ape week, man.  I always thought that man was a frog right there.  Yes.  With the big eyes and the fucking film.  I thought he was a frog.  I thought he was, too, until I was on the set of my sixth movie and somebody pointed 
[03:05:30]  out, that's a camera and a man operating at me.  Is he sure it's not a frog?  Look like a frog in the credits.  I like how they used to yell back then, too.  On the 430 movie.  Yes.  And when there was a variety show.  Tonight's starring.  Nature goes awry week where you had like Food of the Gods, Grizzly, fucking Empire of  the Ants, shit like that.  Do you remember the Million Dollar movie?  Yes.  Where they would play the, what the hell was that, Gone with the Wind? 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  Theme.  And they'd play the, and they'd show video of New York City like Times Square at night  and a fountain with two people sitting on the fountain and lights behind it.  And that used to scare the shit out of me because I was so afraid of being lost there.  Right.  Like it scared me to be alone.  What, is that it?  I think so.  Is it?  Get ready to piss your pants.  Yeah.  See, this scared me.  I hated the Million Dollar Movie.  They ran it on WOR.  Yep.  I would watch it.  See, there's the guy by the fountain. 
[03:06:30]  And I was petrified that, oh my God, what would it be like if I was dropped there without  my mommy and daddy?  What a fucking nerd.  I was so scared all the time.  Come by this fountain.  I'll show you my dick.  No!  Exactly.  I was petrified.  The Million Dollar Movie.  That must be a new version of it though.  Yeah, I think it is.  I don't know the tickets booth when I was a kid.  No.  Hey, what was the other, wasn't there also one on Sunday?  I used to watch Abbott and Costello, but I remember the Frog Cameraman. 
[03:07:00]  What was the Sunday?  Frog Cameraman.  It was the same intro, but it was called The Sunday Afternoon.  Oh, it was the same one?  Okay.  Let's go to Howie in New York City.  Hoo-hoo.  Howie, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Kev, were you scared of the Daleks?  Remember the Doctor Who with Peter Cushing?  Of course, man.  Exterminate.  Exterminate.  Petrified.  That was another show that they ran on WOR when I was a kid.  Channel 9.  Is that called 11 Alive?  And Creature Feature and Chiller Theater were other ones. 
[03:07:30]  Do you remember the jingle for Channel 5?  Before it was, 5 is Fox now?  Yeah, Metro Media Television.  Your choice is 5.  Do you remember that?  I found that on YouTube, and I was like, oh, my God, that's fucked up.  I must have heard that a zillion times growing up.  Hadn't thought about that in 20 years.  Yeah.  And then I happened across it.  I was like, that takes me right back.  Do you think YouTube is going to destroy the Museum of Film and Television?  Probably.  Why not?  It's right there online, man.  Yeah, why would you go? 
[03:08:00]  Just about everything you would find there is online now.  I went to the Museum of Television.  What was it called?  Museum of Television Radio?  Oh, no, yeah.  They had a Bullwinkle retrospective.  I was very into Bullwinkle, and this is like 1991.  And I was coming up to the city to see it, because they didn't have any videotapes out of Bullwinkle.  And I was like, I'm going to go see it.  And the whole Jay Ward retrospective.  And I asked Muse to go with me, Jason Muse.  I was like, why don't you come up with me?  He's like, I will go, because I want to score some weed.  And so I was going to watch Bullwinkle.  He came to score weed.  And we went our separate ways, and I watched cartoons. 
[03:08:30]  And he went off to do his thing.  And then I said, meet me by Port Authority at, like, fucking 2 o'clock.  We're going to take the bus back.  I'm standing in front of Port Authority.  I look across the street, and I see Muse.  And he has a plastic bag in his hand.  And he's dealing with a black gentleman who's about 3 feet taller than him.  Looks very, very tough.  And all I can see in the distance is Muse holding out what looked like money. 
[03:09:00]  The dude quick snapping it out of his hand.  And then grabbing his plastic bag that he had in his hand.  And pulling his arm back really far like he was going to hit Muse.  And Muse did the cower thing.  And then the guy shoved, this is all in, like, almost one fluid motion.  A crumpled brown paper bag in his hand.  Muse runs across the street and shit.  And I was like, what the fuck was that?  He's like, just get on the bus.  Get on the bus.  And so I was like, what happened?  He's like, I tried to buy some weed from that guy.  And he was real mean.  And he stole my Punisher shirt.  Muse had bought a Punisher shirt. 
[03:09:30]  And the dude in the midst of the deal was like, what's in the bag?  And he's like, Punisher shirt.  He's like, give me it.  And he took it off.  Oh, my God.  Are you allowed to keep the weed?  Well, he opens the fucking bag.  We're on the bus.  Oh, no.  New Jersey, opens the bag, and it's got another bag in it.  Opens that bag, and it's got a crumpled up Newport case, you know, from 20-pack cigarettes.  Opens that up.  There's a tissue in it.  Opens the tissue up.  There's a dirty tissue in it.  No weed whatsoever.  See, he should have talked to that guy's manager. 
[03:10:00]  That's just bad salesmanship.  Look, I just wanted weed, and this dude totally mugged me for a Punisher shirt.  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Matt, what's up?  How you doing?  Kevin.  Hey.  Do you remember back on Channel 11, they had the video games on?  They did the...  Yeah.  Picks.  TV picks.  God.  Where the kids would get on, they'd be like, picks, picks, picks, picks, picks.  Picks.  Picks.  Picks.  Picks.  They played like a Space Invaders type of game.  It was usually based on the Intellivision video game module. 
[03:10:30]  And sometimes it was a do-it, do-it, do-it, do-it, basketball one.  Do-it, do-it, do-it, do-it, picks, picks.  They'd have to shoot.  And the good, the smart kids, like with the space game, because there was a, like a viewfinder,  like a targeting thing in the middle, and shifts would kind of periodically cross through  it.  And kids, some kids would try to like target it from their TV, because essentially you'd  say onto your phone, into your phone, picks.  Somebody on the other end of the line would have to hit the button.  Yeah.  But the smart kids would just, as soon as they were like, okay, ready, go.  They would just go, picks, picks, picks, picks, picks, picks, picks. 
[03:11:00]  So it was just on a rapid fire mode.  Just had to keep hitting the button.  God mode.  I totally remember that.  What technology.  They figured out God mode.  That was when they were PIX, John.  Yep.  What is this?  Let's say hi to Bill in Alabama.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  From shit videos to this, look what we can do with this radio show.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, how you doing?  I love you.  Love the show.  Thanks.  You know, a lot of these shows, you know, like million dollar movie and creature features, 
[03:11:30]  you know, we had that out in LA too.  But I'm wondering, there's a little known show, I used to watch it in the middle of the  night called Fractured Flickers.  And I'm wondering if...  Yeah, that was by Jay Ward.  Oh, yeah.  Jay Ward, the guy that did, we just, I just mentioned him a second ago.  What's Fractured Flickers?  The guy that did Rocky and Bullwinkle.  They would take old, go ahead, you tell them, sir.  You're called in.  Oh, no, you could do that a lot better.  Bill from Alabama.  Go ahead.  No, do it, sir.  I've been talking too much.  Let's hear from you, Bill, in Alabama.  Well, it was the most hilarious thing I can remember from back then. 
[03:12:00]  Well, that's not a description.  Talk it.  Go to YouTube.  It's right there.  All right, yeah.  Just punch in Fractured Flickers.  You could see it.  It's on YouTube.  I remember the theme song to the opening, yeah.  Steven S. wants me to ask Kevin if he was an Uncle Floyd fan.  Yeah, of course.  Uncle Floyd.  I had a Hugo puppet like he had at the end of the show.  I don't know Uncle Floyd.  Hugo would do the dance.  He was on like...  You know Uncle Floyd?  Like, what was it, VHF?  Don't know.  I mean, I don't know what he is.  But it was on VHF, right? 
[03:12:30]  That's like where you were off the main dial when there was only channels 2 through 13.  You say that to kids now, and kids are like, what are you talking about?  Get up, change the channel.  With a dial.  And there's Uncle Floyd.  And he went cable access at the end.  Yeah.  Everything is on YouTube, by the way.  Isn't it astounding?  Every single thing ever made is on YouTube.  If you enter my death on YouTube, you will be able to view your death from the future.  That's what it's going to be.  Wow, that's gruesome.  That's pretty bad. 
[03:13:00]  My funeral, you get to see who shows up.  Yeah.  Who my wife fucks after I die, you get to see that.  It's just everything is on there, man.  Find me the Gold Digger Jeans commercial.  I had such a crush on this blonde girl, and I've been dying to find her for years.  Wow.  Well, look it up.  See if it's there.  Gold Digger was an awful part.  Let's go down memory lane.  She's dancing with somebody.  I'm sure you can find the Jordache Has the Fit That's Right commercial.  The Jordache look.  But I used to pretend that I was her boyfriend.  Oh, you did?  I did.  That's just called jerking off to the television. 
[03:13:30]  No, I wouldn't jerk off, but I would like zone out and just like, I would kind of like  kneel by the bed and hold in my shits and fantasize that I was her boyfriend.  Oh, and then one time you, you weren't able to hold it in, right?  No.  What was the time you shit next to your bed?  What?  Was that you?  No.  Don't look at me like that couldn't possibly ever happen.  When I kicked down my pant leg, I was picking up my friend, Bill D'Angelo.  We were walking to a school and I fucking broke one off in my pants and it rolled down  my leg and I kicked it out like a rock cat.  A rock cat?  That's true.  A little nugget. 
[03:14:00]  A fucking shameful nugget.  Let's, uh...  And then some Brazilian broad picked it up in her mouth and rolled around her tongue.  Hold on.  I think Gold Digger's what she made no money for.  A Tootsie Roll.  For a second there, I thought he put Gold Digger as two different words.  Ah, he did.  Don't humiliate me.  Let's go to, uh, Rob and Clifton as he searches for that for Jimmy.  Rob, what's up?  Yeah, what up, boys?  Um, do you remember when they did the Creature of the Black Lagoon in 3D?  On Channel 11?  Really?  Yes. 
[03:14:30]  I do remember that on Channel 11, yes.  And then you'd have to run to the store and get your, uh, 3D glasses from the...  And get your 3D glasses.  And it didn't work.  It didn't work and you'd be pissed off.  Totally, man.  They sold us a false bill of goods.  The only 3D movie I ever saw was Friday the 13th Parts 3 in 3D.  I don't think...  I think that's one of the only...  I said Jaws 3D.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we all do.  There wasn't much going on in there.  No, it was pretty bad.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up? 
[03:15:00]  All right.  And, uh, this guy says he was in the Gold Digger commercial.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, check it out.  I don't know if it's the same one, Jimmy.  I don't think they had too many.  But, uh, it was, uh, the little blonde girl and there was, there was, like, a runway set  up.  And there was, I was a little kid.  I mean, it had to be in, um, 33 now.  So it had to be back in, like, 84 or something.  And, uh, they had us all dressed up as, like, press guys doing, like, little kids' press  guys with, like, suits and little hats and stuff.  And, uh, there was, like, a runway set up.  You don't remember that?  Was she dancing? 
[03:15:30]  No, there was one.  I want to say she was dancing.  It was, like, Gold Digger.  And she was just, like, snap.  I don't, I very vaguely remember.  They had a set of cameras.  I want to say it was before.  No, no, no.  You have a whole other show, Dad.  You talk.  Footer.  Footer.  Hey, Footer, how long have you been listening to our show?  A long time, long time.  And today's the day.  You finally have something for the show.  Like, holy shit, they're talking about Gold Digger.  It's my...  Gold Digger, that's my commercial. 
[03:16:00]  This is my day.  Finally, I've been waiting here.  I was born.  I've been waiting years for this.  Honestly, bro, that's exactly what it was like.  I'm sitting here doing some shit job.  And I can't even hear the shit I have in my car.  And I'm like, bang, this is my day.  I'm on.  I'm on.  This is it.  He's got knowledge on the Gold Digger commercial.  I don't remember, uh, what it was.  Do you know who...  Yeah, Gold Digger jeans.  I didn't think it was 84, though.  I thought the one I saw was a little bit before that, because I was younger, I think.  Maybe I was a little older.  Here's a commercial.  Do you got...  Anybody remember the commercial?  I want to say it was perhaps sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ in Latter-day Saints. 
[03:16:30]  Latter-day Saints.  You have a grandfather in a boat with a grandson, and the kid's name is Jimmy, I believe.  Jimmy Prejudice.  Yes.  Yes.  Where he goes, Grandpa, what's prejudice?  And he's like, well, prejudice is when...  And the grandfather gives a rather eloquent description of prejudice.  Well, the kid said...  The grandfather said so-and-so, and the kid said, well, he's my Jewish friend.  Yeah, he goes, well, who's Billy?  And he goes, well, Billy's my Jewish friend.  And he goes, well, then you are prejudiced, because you think of Billy as your Jewish friend,  and not just your friend. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  Creepy fucking commercial.  It would have been funny if the grandfather said something.  It would have been funny if I could think.  I'm just really...  It would have been really funny, but kind of sad, but funny again, if the grandfather was  just like, nobody's around, look at my dick.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what you get for consorting with a Jewish.  All right.  He's salvaged this one.  And there's two great instant feedbacks coming in.  Dave B. from Philly.  So if you weren't born before 1980, you should just turn off your radio at this point.  I guess we're alienating.  And then Eric from Virginia writes, this has turned into the Chris Farley bit. 
[03:17:30]  Remember that time when...  That was awesome.  How come when I'm having a good time, everyone's like, come on?  I know.  Move on.  People have heard what we're talking about.  Well, we do have...  We're all of a certain age in this room.  We do have the great Big Kev interview with Sam Jackson.  Oh, it's the great.  You want to hear this?  This is when Snakes on a Plane was coming out.  Yes.  Listen to this unbelievable interview.  It's 41 seconds.  Master of the minute or less interview. 
[03:18:00]  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Sam Jackson.  Talking about Snakes on a Plane.  Go ahead, sir.  What do you want me to say about it?  Tell me everything about it.  Jeez.  It's kind of what it sounds like.  You know, it's a bunch of poisonous snakes on a plane full of passengers.  Here's us trying to survive, the snakes kind of doing what snakes do, running around, killing 
[03:18:30]  people.  We got great snakes.  We got great victims.  And we got a really, you know, thrill ride for you if you come and see this thing.  Very good.  That's Sam Jackson talking about Snakes on a Plane.  Wow.  That's the interview.  That's more what they call like a sound bite, I guess.  That is him trying to sell that movie.  In fairness to Kevin, Sam Jackson sucked, too.  He was terrible in that.  How can you tell?  He wasn't on long enough to form an opponent. 
[03:19:00]  You got to figure by the time that was, what, San Diego last year?  San Diego out on the patio thing.  But also, he's just like so fucking tired of talking about Snakes on a Plane.  We'll do it.  All the people who were born after 1980 are going to turn off the radio.  Yeah.  He got it.  Oh, you got it right here?  All right.  You got it.  What a Google master.  This is the commercial Kevin Smith was talking about.  Yesterday, Jimmy said I was prejudiced.  Do you know what prejudice is? 
[03:19:30]  No.  Well, prejudice is when you react to someone because of their religion or their comfort.  But I don't do that.  Who is Jimmy?  Jimmy's one of my Jewish friends.  And you are prejudiced because you think of Jimmy as your Jewish friend and not your friend.  And I think that's really strange about it is, and I remember it, too, from when it used  to air.  They're in two close-ups for a while.  And then, like, for the last five seconds of the spot, they cut out to this horrendous, 
[03:20:00]  like, racking wide shot with the most important part of the message where he's just like,  could you think of Jimmy?  And you're like, what happened?  Well, maybe we're falling out.  I think I know why.  It's because, A, they're the two worst voices in commercial history.  And the grandfather looks like Jack Lemmon.  And he has this fucking, the worst hat.  He's wearing, like, Jughead's crown.  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah, let's see that last shot.  That's hysterical.  It's got, like, fucking plants on it.  He has a hat with plants on it.  And the fucking kid's a no-talent little fucking molestible cunt. 
[03:20:30]  You can't look at that.  And then they're 10 miles away in a swamp.  It's just like...  The scenery's not even worth looking at.  And the director's like, all right, pull back now.  Pull back, way back.  It's like that scene in Scarface where they pull back from him on the balcony.  And he's, like, 80 miles away from him.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm going to tell you that AMC, every single Friday night, is running at 2 a.m.  Look at the cheesy films of the 1950s. 
[03:21:00]  Like, yesterday, it was Plan 9 from Outer Space.  This Friday coming up is Spider People.  So you can imagine all the cheesy special effects that are coming up.  It's going to be hysterical.  Hello.  I know you're here, you freak.  So say something.  All right, we got...  It didn't take that well.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  What's up, bro?  That's funny.  Do you remember the old Emanuel Lewis PSAs with the really bad cartoon drawings? 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was wrestling with my uncle behind the couch, and it changed.  It felt icky.  To say no and go and tell someone you trust.  I do remember the say no and go and tell someone you trust.  I don't remember the icky part.  Well, it's worse.  It's YouTube.  Never seemed icky.  Well, it leads to this.  Why not?  Oh, look at you.  What's this now?  I'm directing, Kevin.  I'm directing.  Tidbit. 
[03:22:00]  You are, man.  Pooh Corner about not okay touching.  The house on Pooh Corner?  What, you know this?  The PSA is about...  Well, I know the house on Pooh Corner, but they did a PSA about not good touching.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I hate to mention it, Pooh.  I really do.  But I think we should tell our friends that danger doesn't always come from strangers.  It can be from someone you know.  Oh, Piglet, you're right.  People you see every day might want to touch you, and sometimes that's dangerous. 
[03:22:30]  Winnie the Pooh shouldn't be saying this now.  Well, there are certain private places on your body that nobody is supposed to touch except you.  Your bathing suit covers your private parts.  Sometimes your parents might touch them if they're dressing you or bathing you,  or the doctor has to touch them when he's examining you.  That's okay touching.  But is there touching if not okay, Pooh? 
[03:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking A, there is.  If your teacher pulls your bathing suit aside and puts a fist in,  that would be on the no-no list.  That's stupid.  It'd just be so much more believable if Pooh was like,  Who was it?  Was it fucking Al?  I knew it.  Al's a fucking pederast.  Is that it right there?  Yeah, look at that.  That's the worst Pooh ever.  That's a cheesy Pooh.  That's the Pooh you're afraid to get touched by.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's the guy who has a Pooh suit just to molest kids in a game. 
[03:23:30]  But look at it.  Like, they're delivering an important message,  but they're wearing these creepy costumes.  There's no facial expressions whatsoever.  You hear fucking Piglet being scared, but he still looks happy.  He's smiling.  Yeah, he's just like,  Oh, Pooh, is there such a thing as wrong touching?  And he's like,  I don't know.  You seem delighted by the concept.  Tell me more, Pooh.  Hey, Pooh.  Oh, yes, Piglet.  And that's the kind of touching that gives you a funny feeling inside. 
[03:24:00]  It feels wrong because other people shouldn't touch your Pooh.  Or does it feel good and you're confused?  Yeah, a funny feeling could be a funny feeling.  That funny feeling is it feels good, but you're a little confused by it.  And the first time I jerked off, that was a pretty funny feeling.  Right.  It started a career that spanned decades.  Could you imagine that this is how you fucking find out that you've been molested  because Winnie the Pooh told you?  Yeah.  Because your parents didn't have the good sense to be like,  Look, if anybody touches your fucking no-no, tell me.  Tell me.  You're watching the house on Pooh Corner and Pooh's just like, 
[03:24:30]  If they touch your cock, it's wrong.  Jeez, that's what happened with the neighbor.  Oh my God, Winnie the Pooh.  How do I get in touch with Pooh and tell him?  Like, what the fuck are you supposed to tell you?  Does anyone have the number for the house on Pooh Corner?  That creepy pig that should be blowing somebody at the end of The Shining.  Great party.  In a fucking massive snap zoom.  Yeah, they both look up. 
[03:25:00]  How great is that to get blown by someone in a piggy outfit?  Not only is it another man, but he's got on a piggy outfit at the party.  Oh, were they dirty?  That party was dirty.  Here we go.  Because other people shouldn't touch your private parts.  But Pooh, what do I do if somebody tries to touch me that way?  Now, here's the important part.  If anybody tries to touch you anywhere in a not okay way, a way that feels wrong, tell them no. 
[03:25:30]  No matter who they are, Pooh?  Pooh, absolutely, piglet.  It's not always a stranger.  Even if it's somebody you know or somebody you've seen at home, at school, or in your neighborhood.  Who can touch me?  This is the kind of advice that gets you on the back of a fucking milk carton.  Yeah.  Because if fucking Uncle Bob tries to touch you wrong and you say no, Uncle Bob doesn't want to be found out.  Right.  Uncle Bob will probably put you in a shallow grave. 
[03:26:00]  And Pooh puts you there with his bad advice.  Basically, you're just supposed to quietly suffer through it.  Deal with it in therapy for years after that.  But make sure you tell your parents, Uncle Bob won't come over anymore.  This is an endless PSA, too, as well.  Oh, God.  Hey, we haven't even gotten to the song or the tricks that bad people use to get you not to tell.  Oh, nice.  Get to the tricks.  Yeah.  Get to the tricks.  Well, we've got to hear the song, though, a little bit.  If someone gets too near to your private parts, say no loud and clear. 
[03:26:30]  That's being smart.  Yes.  And they're showing depictions of it.  Yeah.  Could you show me how?  Here's how.  Oh, say no.  Stop that.  It's not okay with me.  No, don't do that.  I have the right, you see.  My body is my very own.  That's how it's got to be.  I said this thing.  It's not okay with me.  No.  No. 
[03:27:00]  It's really not okay.  No.  Don't do that.  Take your hands away.  Take your hands away.  I know I'm not at all to blame.  I've done nothing bad.  And now I'm going right away to tell my mom and dad.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm going right away to tell my mom and dad.  Not so quick, kid.  Yeah, really.  I think I could do it.  I say no.  I say no.  Stop that.  That is what I say.  No.  Don't do that. 
[03:27:30]  It's really not okay.  I know I'm not at all to blame.  I've done nothing bad.  And now I'm going right away to tell my mom and dad.  That is how those little kids wind up getting killed.  Just snap their neck right there.  Because they're like, I can't have you telling anybody.  Like, I'm telling.  Ah.  Because every one of those guys are like.  The message Pooh should be delivering is like, just fucking play along.  And then when you get a chance, then run away.  And run away. 
[03:28:00]  And then.  Grab a heavy object.  Hit him in the balls.  Yeah.  Even if it was a no, Pooh should say like, say no, but then say, I'll keep it under my  hat.  Yeah.  The secret is all ours.  It's okay.  Well, tricks are bad people use to get them out of the cell.  While you're here, why don't you tell us about tricks?  Glad you asked Pooh.  I turn them all the time, Pooh.  Because I was touched when I was a child. 
[03:28:30]  Glad you asked, Pooh.  Now, this time, I'm talking about tricks that bad people use to get you not to tell when  they do something wrong to you, like touching you in a not okay way.  Oh, my.  But no matter what kind of trick someone tries with you, remember, always tell your parents  or someone you trust when someone tries to touch your private parts.  And keep telling till someone helps you.  Now, what would you do if someone says he'll hurt you if you tell? 
[03:29:00]  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  I'd still tell my mom and dad.  It's a trick.  Good.  Okay.  I don't agree with that at all.  That isn't a trick.  If they say, look, I'm going to hurt you, then you got to like start using your wits.  The trick would be if they brought you back from the dead after they killed you.  That's a trick.  That's what happens.  They don't.  They're not like, I'm going to threaten them with fucking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because there are people that are pedophiles that wouldn't even speak badly to kids. 
[03:29:30]  Like they actually are in love with them and think everything's fine and dandy.  If you're if you're one of those guys that are going to say, look, I'll kill you or your  parents or whatever.  If you don't do this, you're dealing with somebody that's probably going to break your  little neck and you're going to be in a little shallow grave.  Even if you do it, he's going to kill you.  It's a very bizarre thing.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Jimmy really brings up.  You act like you're not going to tell.  I mean, yeah.  Fucking asshole advice.  Tell them to do what you will. 
[03:30:00]  I'll still testify.  That's not the smartest thing to tell a child.  Tell them you're going to ruin their life and livelihood and marriage.  The song they should be singing instead is just like, don't leave the house.  Don't ever leave your house.  It's terrible outside.  Don't ever go outside.  Such a horrible fucking world.  It certainly is.  Really?  There's no very little good in it.  Well, Jordan for Pittsburgh.  Great advice coming from a motherfucking bear that doesn't even wear pants. 
[03:30:30]  That's good.  I'm stealing that joke.  I have no private pun.  Good.  And if someone says they'd hurt your parents if you told.  I wouldn't believe them.  I'd tell.  What if someone says they'll see and hear everything you say and do?  It's just a trick.  I wouldn't believe them.  I'd still tell anyway.  Right.  And if somebody says your parents will never love you again if they find out? 
[03:31:00]  That's true.  No.  It's just a trick.  I'd still tell my parents.  Right again.  Oh, that's dark.  Boy, you kids know how to help yourselves because those threats bad people make are not true.  They're just tricks to get you not to tell.  But they're not just tricks.  If someone does something you think is wrong, even if they say it's a secret, keep telling  and telling.  Someone will believe you.  You tell them, little John Bonet.  Just tell.  What if it's your dad or something? 
[03:31:30]  He's going to run in the room and run back in.  Guess what you just tried to tell me.  Pooh doesn't cover that.  No.  Pooh, what happened to your private parts?  Someone stole them.  Stole my manhood.  I got them caught in.  I hang out with a pig and a rabbit and an owl because of it.  They had honey on them and the bees stung it off.  It was eaten by a bear because there was honey on it.  He ripped my cock and balls off. 
[03:32:00]  Now I am a faggoty unicbear who cock blocks everyone else.  Eat my ass, piglet.  Look at that song.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Tell me if you can.  I've got to get back to the house.  Kenny Loggins, really?  Yeah.  You'd be surprised.  There's so much to be done. 
[03:32:30]  Count all the bees in the high.  Chase all the clouds from the sky.  Yeah.  Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh.  Someday your privates will look like Kenny Loggins' beard.  What I think is really nice is we started the XM show talking about Pooh, and now we're 
[03:33:00]  finishing up talking about even more Pooh.  Jeremy in Pennsylvania, what's up?  I love this fucking show.  Kevin, you are a god.  We go from the world is a wonderful place.  The internet is better than modern medicine, too.  It's a horrible place.  Get indoors and you're never going out.  Yes.  I agree, sir.  Basically, everything you need, you can get indoors, man. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  You want to experience life?  Do it through the internet.  Through YouTube.  The magic of YouTube.  Yep.  All right.  I guess that's about it.  Yes, Pooh.  Pooh says it's time to go now.  Where's Tigger?  Oh, getting it up the ass.  There's a little more to that clip.  Telling and telling.  Someone will believe you.  It's not your fault.  Tell.  Just say, Mom, Dad, that person touched me and it felt wrong.  Don't be such a rat fuck, Piggot. 
[03:34:00]  Snitches get stitches.  It'll be a long time before you meet anyone who can take your entire dingle into their mouth.  Enjoy it while you can.  Don't be such a little fruit.  I got it.  Fucking Jimmy. 
[03:34:30]  That's funny.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  There's another PSA that He-Man and She-Ra do from like the early 80s where they actually tell you that if you get touched to tell a priest or a rabbi or one of your clergy.  Oh, great.  Oh, really?  Good idea, that is.  Yeah, it's beautiful. 
[03:35:00]  It's real fun.  Well, that sounds like a shame, child.  Come over here.  I'll see you guys later.  It's even more.  Do the priest as poo.  Come here, child.  No, no, no.  That's the Irish priest.  Do the priest as poo.  Yes, come here, little child.  Sit on my knee and I'll tell you about Jesus and his little loincloth.  Your poo voices were priceless.  You took poo.  You made them into a British fruit. 
[03:35:30]  Christ died for what I'm about to do to you.  Let's go to Bruce in Mississippi.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, today on the Opie and Anthony show, I learned that Steve ate Winnie the Pooh's cock and balls.  Poor Steve.  Is that the...  Did you find it?  Yeah.  Fucking YouTube, man.  Is this it?  Really?  Yeah.  All right, let's take a listen.  What's this?  She-Man.  Uh, She-Man.  She-Man and She-Man.  Right, right.  She-Man.  That's another video that Jimmy watched earlier.  She-Man. 
[03:36:00]  She-Man and I want to talk to you about something that's very personal.  Your body.  Remember, it's your body and no one should touch you in a way that you feel is wrong.  I'll get anybody who tries it.  It's not that easy, Orko.  So, it's hard for a young person to admit that he or she has been touched in a bad way.  If you've been touched that way, don't be ashamed.  Why is he pointing at me, accusing me?  Yeah.  If you've been touched that way, it's your fault.  Damn it.  It means you're dirty.  You little cocktease. 
[03:36:30]  Keep it to yourself or the Lord won't forgive you.  Superheroes never get touched.  This Dutch boy hairdo.  Oh, he's just great.  Oh, the animation was so bad during that period.  So weak, man.  They would just have, like, one fucking plate and then the mouth moved.  Took forever to fucking draw this shit up.  Oh.  Here, get the rest of it.  No fluid motion.  If you've been touched that way, don't be ashamed.  Tell someone you trust, like your parents, your doctor, your teacher, or counselor, or your minister or rabbi. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  Right, Orko.  Right on.  Tell everybody.  I know.  I can put a sign out front.  It's not bad enough that you're looking at two impossibly beautiful people giving you advice like this.  And then they bring the weird phantom ghost fuck bat thing in to back him up.  Where they're like, right, Orko?  He's like, yeah.  I don't even exist.  And I have the moment where he's just like, if anyone tries that with you, I'll get him.  Yeah.  And you're a kid and you're like, Orko's got my back. 
[03:37:30]  Like, yeah.  Okay, this is good.  And then when Uncle Tommy has your fucking balls in his mouth, where's Orko?  Orko.  Orko, please save me.  Orko!  Orko doesn't have to worry about penetration, though.  No, he's too dungible.  Orko has no lower torso.  Right, right.  Exactly.  No wonder Orko doesn't care.  He fucking shits into a bag.  Fuck it.  If someone tries to touch your bag, run!  Well, that's a good public service. 
[03:38:00]  We fucked up line of the day because there's some late entries now.  Kevin Smith's going to be on Letterman tomorrow night.  And pick up the book, please.  My Boring-Ass Life, The Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin Smith.  Very good.  That's me.  Hey, can I give a shout-out to Smodcast?  Yes.  Absolutely.  I mean, it's Scott Mosher.  And it's called Smodcast.  And you can find it at iTunes or Quick Stop Entertainment.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, funny shit, man.  Really good.  And Kevin's going to do a little show on our channel. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  In the very near future, hopefully.  We're going to work out those details.  It'll be the same thing, man.  Or you can just give us some old podcasts and we'll broadcast them.  Dope.  I'm serious.  I would like to.  Get a few that you're really, really proud of and we'll throw them up on the channel.  I got 30.  Love them all.  They're genius.  They're fun.  No, they're fun.  I'm not even kidding.  We'll throw a few of those up on the channel, too.  Totally.  I'm meant to it.  Thanks for having me on.  Just don't ask for money from us.  Yeah, that'll never happen.  Well, from the company.  That's what I mean.  I still think one of the fucking darkest, most sinister, funny things I've heard maybe 
[03:39:00]  in the last five years was Pooh going like, was the line where you fucking capped it?  Where you go with the parents.  Oh, you are wrong.  Yeah.  It was your fault.  Oh, your parents won't love you anymore.  Yeah.  He goes to the stranger and says like.  If you think your parents aren't going to love you anymore.  Because that's true.  It's true.  It's true.  They'll hate you.  It's so fucking dark.  Line of the.  Line of the.  Your father will hug you, but the eye contact will never be the same. 
[03:39:30]  Our last smart cast was all about Harry Potter.  It was.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  You can only think of things you could have done to get away, but didn't.  That's right.  It's always going to be in the back of their heads and the slutty clothes you went out in.  For the rest of your life, you'll be his son who was fucked without a struggle.  Oh, my God. 
[03:40:00]  What's even fucking funny with her is every time Jimmy does his poo, he moves like she's  three feet off, his arms are moving like three feet off.  He gets his little stiff arm.  I know.  Over here.  Over here.  Fucked without a struggle.  That is not even close to being correct.  So horrible.  Why do we laugh at horrific shit like that? 
[03:40:30]  I'm telling you, the stiff arm sells it.  That fucking killed me.  I love it.  Oh, boy.  Line of the day.  Here we go.  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net, offering you all the tools you need to win  this season in fantasy football.  Trash talk with confidence and take home the glory.  BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  All right.  What a fucking nerd.  I was so scared all the time.  Come by this fountain.  I'll show you my dick.  There you go. 
[03:41:00]  Kevin Smith with a runner-up line of the day.  Danny's running something.  That's what I was scared of.  What do you got?  It makes sense to close with this today.  We never played it.  Oh.  We never played this?  Not the heavy metal version.  Okay.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Someday your privates will look like Kenny Loggins' beard.  Never enough occasions to fit Kenny Loggins' beard in.  Because it was always just so unkempt and stupid looking.  Yeah, it was going to puff it up.  But it was an awesome delivery of beard. 
[03:41:30]  Beard.  It turned it into a two-syllable word.  It should be noted, Redding writes, Jimmy just had line of the day.  Yeah.  There's been a lot of them.  That's a good one.  The voting booth has closed.  I know.  It's like Cuckoo's Nest.  Just, what are you going to pull that henhouse shit now?  Mr. McMurphy, the vote was 10 to 8.  Cunch he was.  I love the guy who's dancing in Cuckoo's Nest.  You want to watch the ball game? 
[03:42:00]  And the old man just dances.  Fucking helpless.  Coke logic, I love you.  Stop.  Thinks I don't like him anymore.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Tell.  Just say, Mom, Dad, that person touched me and it felt wrong. 
[03:42:30]  Don't be such a rat fuck.  Buss.  Buss.  Yeah, that is a rat fuck.  A penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is a word, though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis.  So no matter what you've heard, remember the penis is the proper word.  Buss.  Is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina, and some children call it vagina.  Buss.  When she's naked, it will show. 
[03:43:00]  All girls have a vulva.  So no matter what you've heard, remember the vulva is the proper word.  Both boys and girls have breasts.  Each person recognizes.  They're plowed upon our chests.  And go to different sizes.  Our anus is a useful thing to be.  The anus gives relief in time of need.  We all have an anus.  So no matter what you've heard, remember the anus is the proper word.  So don't be appalled, because that's what they're called.  And each of them's the proper word for private pause. 
[03:43:30]  Radio discomfort.  That was from one of the most awful shows ever.  It was like an hour-long special starring the Fonz.  And the Fonz was telling me how not to be touched.  Oh, it's just great.  Hey, he's working on his bike.  Like, hey, don't let anyone touch your pecker.  What the fuck is the Fonz talking about?  All he's talking about is fucking the twins up in his room. 
[03:44:00]  My favorite part of that song, though, is when he goes,  your anus, it gives relief in times of need.  But he's not mentioning that.  It's to the older gentleman.  The fuck you get to the whole time?  All right, let's thank Kevin Smith.  Thank you.  You gave us some great energy.  Of course, eh?  The guy's up all night, and he comes in for the whole show.  Yeah, in case anyone's out there going like,  oh, it's so horrible, they laugh at those child abuse jokes.  I haven't slept in over 24 hours. 
[03:44:30]  Of course.  If I had a good eight hours sleep, I would have been, like, chastised.  You'd be yelling at us.  We understand that.  It's so funny about child abuse, except fucking fucked without a struggle.  That was so fucking dark.  It's so dark.  It's just funny at that point.  All right, and we're going to get a podcast on the channel soon from Mr. Smith.  And he's going to do a live show for the channel as well.  Yay.  Big Kev, you got some? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, just check out my show, Big Kev's Geek Stuff,  at bigkevsgeekstuff.com.  And we're coming back to XM also on October the 13th.  Nice.  There you go.  Anybody else?  No, just I would say I have a couple of little local gigs I'm doing in October,  but I'm going to have them on my website.  I'm doing, like, 150 seaters and less to work on new material,  because the special comes out October 13th.  But Kevin's book, My Boring-Ass Life,  is the uncomfortably candid diary of Kevin Smith.  It looks really interesting. 
[03:45:30]  And we've got a couple mentions in there, which I'm very flattered by.  Which is very nice.  It's very rare that that happens, that the show is mentioned.  True.  We gave Louis Black one of the greatest stories ever.  He doesn't write about it.  I'm glad he didn't, because I did.  Yeah.  I fucking hijacked the voyeur bus from my horse shit.  Kevin's on Letterman tomorrow night.  Yes.  There's some fucking broad that nobody wants to hear from.  Yeah, but, and the cool thing is,  all the stuff we talked about today,  he's going to be talking about on Letterman.  Absolutely.  For the first time on Network TV.  Shot my wad.  I'm like, hey man, Dave, did you ever think child molestation was funny? 
[03:46:00]  What happened?  The old pen tap.  Did you let him in pen tap?  Oh, get him out of here.  Get him out of here.  All of a sudden they're going to have some old Regis interview where you were supposed to be like,  what the fuck happened?  Kevin was supposed to be on to it.  Hey guys, thanks.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Later.  I just love listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sometimes I laugh so hard,  I forget about all the times my Uncle Henry rubbed my special place.  Opie and Anthony! </pre>
