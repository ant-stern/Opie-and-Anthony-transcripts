<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic mix of listener-driven segments, controversial discussions, and stunts.  The show began with "Whip-em-out Wednesday," encouraging women to flash their breasts, alongside a discussion of inconsiderate moviegoers, often with callers making racial generalizations and stereotypes.  This led to a highly offensive and controversial call from "Old Dirty," filled with racial slurs and hateful rhetoric, prompting a heated exchange with the hosts and other callers.  The segment also included a promotion for a "wow sticker stop" at a GameStop in Union, New Jersey, with Spaz and Jeff Norris participating. Discussions about the New York Knicks and Sobey Beverages were interspersed throughout, along with further "Whip-em-out Wednesday" calls and complaints about annoying behaviors.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion sparked by Reverend Al Sharpton's claims about pre-Socratic African civilizations, met with skepticism from the hosts and a Greek caller.  This led to humorous banter and a listener call-in segment focusing on annoying things like inconsiderate subway behavior, Dominican Yankee fans, and Patrick Ewing's health. A history teacher emphasized the importance of written records in establishing historical accuracy, and a black female caller criticized the show's racial humor, sparking a debate.  The "WOW" sticker campaign was discussed further, comparing it to a competitor's campaign and detailing damage to the show's van, with Spaz and Big Kev offering accounts of the incident.

The show then moved to the central stunt: getting a woman to flash her breasts on live television during a news report on the Big Apple Tours bus closure at 48th and 8th. "Psycho Mark" acted as an on-the-ground reporter, relaying information and attempts to facilitate the stunt.  Callers provided updates and pledged money toward the reward.  The hosts also played prank calls from their "Dementor World" CD, including one about a deceased father at the Super Bowl, and discussed a caller's attempt to get a WOW sign on a vehicle,  as well as further damage to their WOW van.  "Psycho Mark" deployed a sign ("the A-bomb") which was successfully shown on the live news broadcast.


The final segment focused on the aftermath of "the A-bomb" incident.  Listeners called in confirming they had seen genitalia briefly displayed on the live news segment.  The hosts and callers reacted with shock, laughter, and disbelief, using military metaphors to describe the event.  Callers recounted their reactions and attempts to get others to see it.  The show played Steven Lynch's "Kill a Kitten," and aired advertisements for Ranch One Restaurants and Rockaway Bedding.  The hosts joked about potential consequences, including loss of syndication, and a caller claimed responsibility for the incident. The segment ended with discussions of the event's impact and possible consequences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Whip-em-out Wednesday!  What is that? Like some kind of guy thing? Like some kind of sexist guy thing?  Yeah!  You will not get away with this!  I wish you could just shut your page up!  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday!  Oubala!  Obi and Anthony. N-E-W.  Yes! Hey!  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday. The weather's perfect, so start flashing your goddamn boobs, ladies.  Yeah, help us out. 
[00:00:30]  Make our days.  Make our week. Make our month.  And guys, I hope you have a wow in your car today.  You're going to see some stuff.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Either get the wow sticker or put a homemade wow on the car.  We are doing a wow sticker stop today, Anthony.  Where at?  At 4.30 Spaz.  Spaz leaving the show to do a wow sticker stop today.  We get to meet Spaz and our buddy, our pal, Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy.  Oh.  4.30 at GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  We'll have plenty of wow stickers out there with Spaz and Jeff Norris.  4.30 today.  Yeah.  GameStop right there on Route 22, Union, New Jersey.  We've got to go right back to the phones.  A lot of people still have comments about the movie thing from yesterday.  Yeah.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Let's go to Wendy.  Wendy, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  We're doing well.  I have a similar story, actually.  There was some guys in the movie theater.  We went to go see the Sixth Sense, me and my boyfriend. 
[00:01:30]  And actually, I told them to shut up because they were kicking the chair and they were yelling.  And after the movie, my boyfriend actually had a confrontation with them and he got hit in the eye.  Yeah, see, is it worth a fight?  I know, but he wouldn't tell them and no one else in the movie would tell them.  Yeah, well, I know because we're in fear.  Fear for our lives.  And I'd just like to say that I did my first whooping out Wednesday today.  And how did it feel?  Oh, it felt great.  It was a little confusing because I was going to school and I was actually traffic and I almost hit into the car in front of me because it's kind of confusing, you know, whipping them out and trying to drive. 
[00:02:00]  Well, you've got to be very careful.  We don't want anyone getting hurt out there, you know.  I know.  A lot of the ladies have, like, a designated driver so the other lady can wow and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to do that today, but I saw it and I figured, you know, a nice weather, I might as well do it.  And you felt good after you did it?  I felt great.  You probably made that guy's weak.  I hope so.  How big are your boobies there, Wendy? 
[00:02:30]  Thirty-six V.  Nice.  Bravo.  I would drive off the road if I saw that.  Is that your real name, Wendy?  Uh, thank you, Wendy.  Okay.  Yes, her real name's Wendy.  Of course.  Of course.  We don't even have to question that anymore.  Nope.  Let's go to Pam.  Hey, Pam, what's going on today?  Oh, I am so glad I got through.  Yeah.  I had, like, the same situation, but we were actually escorted by the police from the theater.  All right, why is that?  And we got refunded.  All right, we're talking, because it's been about seven minutes now. 
[00:03:00]  We're talking about people that are nice and loud and scream at the screen at movies.  Yeah.  Right, that's exactly what they were doing, though.  And what happened?  And we had to say something.  They were screaming at the movies.  They were kicking the chair.  They were going crazy.  And I said something, and they actually, we had to be escorted from the theater because  of these people.  Oh, because you were fearing for your life?  Fearing for my life, absolutely.  Yeah.  That's, you should be able to go to a movie these days.  I don't get it.  Like I said, I like the idea of having bouncers. 
[00:03:30]  Like at the strip clubs.  Just huge, big, burly bouncers like you see at strip clubs.  Uh-huh.  And they're in the theater.  I said I would pay twice as much.  And I would.  I would pay $18 a ticket to know I could go in and sit and watch the whole movie undisturbed  that if someone makes a peep, there's no second chances.  There's no nothing.  You get physically lifted out of your seat by these burly bouncers and thrown out onto  the street.  I would love that. 
[00:04:00]  That's a great idea.  And there's a big disclaimer on your ticket and on the door that says, you know, the  theater isn't responsible.  If you do this, if you come in here, you're going to take anything that happens to you.  There's really no reason to talk in a movie theater.  I mean, it's like I said, people think they're so important.  They're the most, most people think they're the most important person in the world.  Yeah.  And everyone else doesn't matter.  Yep.  I don't care if people are annoyed.  I'm having fun in here.  Like they think as they're talking, people are like, you know, I paid nine bucks for a movie, 
[00:04:30]  but this conversation is so interesting and this person is just so fascinating.  I'm going to listen to them instead of watch the movie.  Could you keep talking?  Hey, turn the movie down, please.  I want to hear her.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Let's go to Don.  Don, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, Don, what's up?  Hey, I was at Choochia there this weekend with my girlfriend.  We decided to see Frequency.  So we sit all the way in the back row of the movie theater and there's just four handicapped  seats behind us.  So we're figuring nobody's going to be talking back there. 
[00:05:00]  We get a girl, Hispanic girl, on a freaking cell phone having a conversation.  Yeah, the cell phone things are another thing.  Well, cell phones in general are annoying as hell.  Yeah, but I don't understand why people, yeah, bring the cell phones and then answer  them in the middle of a movie theater.  Yeah, but especially she's making calls.  We turn around at the same time.  We say, excuse me, can you go outside?  Why don't you stand like a deer in the headlight?  Yeah, like you're the idiot.  Yeah, like you're the idiot.  Or asking.  You paid money to come and see a movie and you want quiet so you can watch the movie and 
[00:05:30]  you're the jerk off.  How did that happen?  When did that happen?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Guys, syndication now.  All right.  Thank you, Doc.  Take care.  Bye.  I don't understand when that happened.  Let's go to Vanessa.  Vanessa.  Yes?  Are you pissed at us, it looks like?  Yeah, I'm very angry at you.  All right.  I am Hispanic.  Yeah.  And just because some individuals don't know how to act and they act like they were raised  in a barn doesn't mean all of the Hispanics act that way. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, wow.  You know, I didn't even hear in my conversation saying all Hispanics act like that.  I think Anthony explained that it's not all.  Didn't I say like maybe three times over that entire conversation that it's not all, but  I've noticed a disproportionate number.  And I have seen white people.  So have I.  Of course.  So have I.  Because it's just stupid people who just don't know how to act and they act like savages.  It doesn't mean that everyone is that way.  And Vanessa, if you were listening, you would have heard me say. 
[00:06:30]  I believe me.  I was flipping stations and you just caught my ear and I stayed and I listened to everything  that you said.  Believe me, I'm not that close minded where I would say every Hispanic person and every  black person is a problem in a movie theater because there have been times I've gone into  movie theaters, blacks, Hispanics, white Jews and had a great time, sat in a silent  movie.  But the majority of the times I have been disturbed in a movie theater, it has been a black or  Hispanic person.  That's all I'm saying.  And I'm not saying that it's never been a white person. 
[00:07:00]  Of course it has.  It would be ridiculous to say otherwise.  But the majority of the times I'm disturbed, it's a black or Hispanic person.  Who was the individual who said something about chickens running around?  Oh, I did.  That was funny.  That was called the comedic insertion in the story.  Do you think that someone is a Spanish or they carry chickens in their pocket?  Vanessa, before you get into it, my girlfriend is 100% Puerto Rican.  It's called a joke.  Relax.  Lighten up.  It's called a stereotype. 
[00:07:30]  I believe and I'm married to a white man.  And it's based on some sort of reality because when Anthony was living in Massachusetts,  there were Hispanics raising chickens.  In an apartment complex.  In an apartment complex.  I'd come outside and I'd have to step over chickens.  That's an individual who's a pig.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  Hey, Vanessa.  It makes no sense.  Anyone in your family ever own a chicken?  Be honest.  Own a chicken?  No.  Why would you own a chicken?  I don't know.  I'm a New Eurekan. 
[00:08:00]  You know what a New Eurekan, right?  I was born in the United States, New York.  Yeah.  Okay.  I wasn't born in Puerto Rico.  All right.  All right, Vanessa.  We're just trying to have fun.  You guys are crazy.  We go over the line all the time.  We understand that.  But we're just trying to have fun.  Okay?  Okay.  We're hoping you laugh at us.  All right?  I kind of didn't like the chicken joke.  Other than that, you're right.  There are people in theaters who don't act like morons.  The chicken joke's funny.  They're everywhere.  The chicken thing is just funny. 
[00:08:30]  Just to help out the story a little.  That's all.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  There goes Vanessa.  Obviously, she just started listening to this show and has no clue what we're about.  Not a clue.  That's okay.  New fan, I'll be.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Well, let me turn you down here.  All right, John.  Okay.  Well, I got to say, I could not agree with you more.  And, you know, I had an incident in an office, Max, making copies. 
[00:09:00]  I'm sitting there with a stack.  And now they have, like, this little thing in the middle there, like this desk where you  can rip papers on and have, like, 500 sheets on making copies going back and forth.  This black lady walks in.  And first she tries to get the guy right in front of me to sneak in right in the middle of  him making copies.  And then, I guess she, the time she tries to go over to me, I said, excuse me, I'm in  the middle of making all these copies.  You really, you can't let me come in there and make a few copies.  You're white as blah, blah, blah.  And the whole thing, and everyone's looking at it. 
[00:09:30]  I said, yeah, I'm a racist.  I hate you because you're black and you can't make copies.  Why don't you call your good friend Al Sharpton?  Wow.  I swear, these people, I don't care.  I tell it how it is.  These Spanish, spics, black people.  Oh, my God.  Ring the bell, man.  Ring the bell.  So many of these people are life and they're crap and they don't belong in this country.  Let them go back to some third world country where their ancestors are from or where they're  from because it has brought this country and especially the New York tri-state area into 
[00:10:00]  the toilet.  All right, Jim.  Wow.  Thank you.  Opie, this is an open forum of calls.  We must state that the caller's views are not necessarily those of the Opie and Anthony  show or WNEW.  And we'll be back with the Bob Grant program in just a bit.  Bob Grant.  You're out of the air.  Savages.  The food.  Who's the mayor?  That washroom attendant.  Right.  Dinkins.  I can't believe he said that.  When, yeah.  Bob Grant called Dinkins, he used to call him the washroom attendant. 
[00:10:30]  That mayor washroom attendant.  My God.  Is he still on the radio?  Yeah, I think so.  When is he on?  I think when we're on.  Are you serious?  I really don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to listen to him, though, you know, when I was working.  So I'd be in the truck.  I'd flip him on.  It was kind of funny.  Listen to him, bitch.  But he doesn't do it to anyone.  Since he got fired.  What was he on?  He used to be on.  He was on one stage.  He got fired.  Another one took him up and he lost his ball.  Yeah.  And that was it.  He lost his little ball.  It was the end of it because it used to be kind of entertaining. 
[00:11:00]  I have to call his call up.  And I swear to God, it didn't matter what you were saying.  If it was against his viewpoint, he would just unload on you.  What are you talking about, you buffoon?  Smart team?  They're savages.  How about I wrap you in the mouth?  You can tell old ladies.  Old ladies.  I'm going to come over and wrap you in the mouth.  I like it.  Oh, my God.  Listening to you talk.  I need my digitalis.  What are you doing?  You're a buffoon.  Hey, Eric.  Yeah, what's up?  How are you doing?  Help us out here.  What's up?  All right, about two years ago, I saw an Asian gang fight go down over in UA, Douglaston. 
[00:11:30]  And, you know, the guys were going at it verbally for a little while, and then one of them jumped  over the aisle.  And this was the aisle across from me, so I got the whole view.  But the security guards were in like in two seconds, you know?  Yeah.  And so I guess, you know, occasionally they do their job and stuff.  Yeah, they don't have enough security.  They don't have ushers anymore in the theater.  The usher?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, I guess it was donut night or something down there because they had the cops. 
[00:12:00]  The usher down at the pavilion?  Oh, I swear to God, this guy is like three feet tall.  He's like this little fat midget guy with a flashlight and stuff.  And you look at him and you're like, what is he going to do to anybody?  Oh, the people around there would just pick him up and chuck him down the aisle.  Yeah, they would beat you with the usher.  That's what they would do.  But, you know, this whole thing goes to show you that, like, there is really no racial equality  around here.  Because if you start talking about white people, it's like, fine, whatever.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it's like, yeah, white people are screwed up. 
[00:12:30]  They just do different screwed up things.  But as soon as you get on, you know, with what everyone else does, then you're a member  of the Klan, right?  I've seen plenty of inconsiderate whitey in my day.  Believe me.  Believe me.  And we've talked about that a thousand times on this show.  But for some reason, when you say that blacks or Hispanics are inconsiderate at certain  places, like the movie theater, you're just, people will call up and tag you as a racist  and blah, blah, blah.  It's like, eh, bullcrap.  Give me a break.  Of course.  That's the way it is. 
[00:13:00]  All right, guys.  Syndication when that guy finally hits the floor when he jumps off a real building.  Yeah.  I was bombed.  Bloody God.  Why are people cheering when he got rescued?  A thousand people started cheering when that guy got rescued yesterday.  A couple coming in here.  Frank from Pearl River.  Anthony, you would have cleared the theater if you would have announced you were an agent  from INS.  Steve C. from FoundryMusic.com.  Ah, Steve.  You guys shouldn't be apologizing for cracking on races.  Did you ever notice that most Hispanic or black comedians base their entire set on 
[00:13:30]  making fun of white people?  Yeah.  Okay, no big shock there.  But they shouldn't get so offended at a little joke when whitey throws it out there.  Yeah.  All right.  And I think we're on to something here, a little phone thing.  Yeah.  Instead of, like, attacking the races, I think everyone can play along for the next half  hour or so.  Mm-hmm.  Why don't you call up and tell us stuff that people do that piss you off?  Yeah.  Very simple topic.  Inconsiderate, obnoxious, cell phones on the trains, people yelling in movies. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  What else?  What are some of the things people do that really piss you off?  We want to hear from you today, okay?  I got one.  It doesn't have to be a race thing.  At the gas station.  Yeah.  After you fill the tank up, move, you're effing car away from the pump.  Do you do that?  Like, I swear to God, if you have to go inside to pay.  When I get gas, it's like a pit stop at Indy.  Right.  I feel guilty.  Exactly.  I feel guilty.  I, like, pull up.  I quickly, you know, while the gas is being pumped, I put the cap so it's going in my 
[00:14:30]  car while I'm paying.  Right.  The whole process takes me 30 seconds.  I usually just use the pay at the pump thing, you know?  Well, yeah.  That's even better.  And I'm gone.  But sometimes you have to pay.  You have to go up into the building and pay.  Right.  I swear to God, I fill up, and you move your goddamn vehicle.  Move it away from the pump, especially if there's a line.  Right.  Check it.  Well, we'll go on this topic for a while.  Things people do that piss you the F off. 
[00:15:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Old Day.  Yeah.  Old Day, what up?  What up, Old Day?  Yo, what's up, man?  Yo.  I'm opening up a travel agency.  I'm here having breakfast.  You know what I'm saying?  And Anthony's here with his two-day movie thing.  Yo, now I'm going to talk at the movies all the time.  Oh, please.  You probably do.  You talk at the movies?  No, I don't, actually.  I don't.  It's so inconsiderate.  It is.  Why do you need to talk to the screen?  Well, that's how it is.  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:15:30]  We're adding our commentary to the flick.  Well, you don't need to when there's 500 people seeing the movie with you.  I understand that.  All right.  Some of my people, they don't know how to act.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, Dirty.  What's up?  Something that pisses you off when the cops grab you for stealing beer.  Ah, come on.  I don't steal beer.  Who was walking out?  Unfortunately, you get it on credit.  Who was walking out of the road show with a fistful of Coronas?  You saw it?  And the cops grabbed you, didn't they?  I thought you were going to bring that up the other day when we said if you got in trouble 
[00:16:00]  after the road show.  You said no.  Yeah, come on, man.  Chief of Cop has gotten more people out of trouble on this program.  Yeah.  I had like eight Coronas in my arms.  I'm like running across the parking lot.  And the cops are like, oh, you know.  I rolled up real quick.  He goes, where you going with all of that?  And I had two open already.  I'm like, uh.  Two open.  Two.  Yeah.  I'm putting my top of the hood. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And then Keith comes.  Like, he comes running from like a block away.  He's like, oh, no.  He's like, wait, how old are you?  I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm a big guy.  I got an idea and everything.  So then PR comes.  PR comes.  If PR would have continued like berating the cops, he began to like berate the cop.  Oh, shit.  People's like, you know how this is?  We were in there and blah, blah, blah, missing out.  And I'm like, yo, PR, shut the ass up, bro.  Shut up.  It's going to be an incident, man.  I want to get out of here. 
[00:17:00]  You want to be?  He goes, nah, nah.  He's already like, you know, once you put your hands on the cop, it's over.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, God.  PR was already getting that way, man.  I'm like, oh, my God.  There's no one talking himself out of it once the hands are laid.  That's it.  Yeah, I see you getting handcuffed, kid.  That's right.  You're going down.  Yeah, Keith came, bro.  He showed them this, you know, their cop ID thing.  And, you know, I grabbed my beers and proceeded to hustle my way out of Nassau County, kid.  Wait, so you were allowed to take the beers?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  You just talk it over.  Yeah.  And be respectful to the officer.  And things are cool.  Oh, did I tell you what happened up in Boston?  No.  Oh, my God.  I was driving down the shoulder of the road because the concert was going on.  And there was a huge traffic jam getting into Foxborough.  The River Rave.  Yeah.  We were talking about that yesterday.  Sure.  Went up to Boston.  And State Trooper.  Whoop, whoop.  Grabs me.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to Foxborough, man.  Yeah, I got to do stage announcements and stuff.  You know, I'm late. 
[00:18:00]  And just talked to the guy like a human being.  He's like, all right, just stay off the shoulder, man.  I can't.  And this wasn't in New York.  It wasn't anybody who knew what the hell we were doing or anything.  And then trying to get to the road show Thursday.  Oh, my God.  I was on the belt.  And something happened with the drawbridge under the belt.  Tell me you did a star skiing hutch over the drawbridge.  No, I was going to.  I swear I was ready to because we were late.  So it wasn't even driving on the shoulder.  I swear to God, I was just in a field next to the belt. 
[00:18:30]  Next to the belt parkway before the drawbridge.  Just in a puff of dust.  I looked like the roadrunner.  All right.  That's all you saw was dust.  You know, Anthony, you crazy.  Now, I just don't care.  See, I got to tell everyone, you know, when Ants tells this stuff on the radio, he's telling  the truth.  I've driven with him enough.  It wasn't even the shoulder.  I was laughing.  I'm hitting ruts and ditching.  I was off-roading in Brooklyn.  Well, that's what the SUVs are made for anyway. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  Get a pussy out.  Wax it up every weekend so you can drive it on the road.  Yeah.  O.D.  Yeah.  Are you getting a job soon or what?  Yo, I told you I had secured employment with a major telecommunications firm, bro.  What more you want me to tell you, man?  That was two weeks ago.  What are you talking about?  Andy, yo, my man, yo.  This is the corporate process, man.  The corporate process.  Anyway, I'm upset, man.  What are you waiting to?  Yeah, man, you're Anthony, man.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  You and your movies.  Wait for it to come out on DVD. 
[00:19:30]  That's why you got it, bro.  Believe me.  You leave the movie theater.  It's what speaks in my peoples, all right?  All right, O.D.  It's what speaks to us, man.  I thank Joey Paisano every day for that DVD.  That's right, man.  I never have to leave the house.  All right.  What third world nation?  We don't belong here.  Man, you white people is crabby.  I remember when I used to go to work downtown?  You used to.  They used to treat me like a felon.  And I used to go to work and I used to go to work and I used to go to work and I was  old dirty.  Old dirty, if you described your occupation, I think that would be accurate. 
[00:20:00]  Old dirty, hold on.  You are a felon.  You're happy, man.  Old dirty, you are a felon.  You are not.  No, I have not been convicted of any felonies, bro.  Convicted, the key word.  You see what I'm saying?  Those are alleged.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  A couple misdemeanors, though, right?  What?  A couple misdemeanors?  Yeah, but I don't do misdemeanors.  It ain't going to equal a felony.  Since when is assault and battery not a felony?  When did I assault somebody?  Dude, what were you arrested for?  I think the charges were dropped as well. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yo.  O.D. is trying to say.  I never saw the grand jury and I like that.  You know what I'm saying?  I walked, homeboy.  I'm teflon.  Teflon.  Teflon all day.  Yo, let me tell you.  Man, when I used to go to work downtown in Wall Street, bro.  Yeah.  Yo.  I'm like, yo.  You know, let me get on it, man.  You used to work down in Wall Street?  I remember a three-card money table down there.  Sure.  Plenty of times.  Plenty of times, bro.  You know what I'm saying?  I've been down there. 
[00:21:00]  Yo.  White people.  Taking care of the boys at lunchtime or what?  What happened?  Where did you unzip the duffel bag?  In Battery Park, bro.  All right, yeah.  You worked on Wall Street.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  So like 99% of your white people are fat, bro.  You got three or four chins going on.  You got a big-ass belly.  You know what I'm saying?  When you sit down on the, like the four to five trains, I like the individual, you know,  cutouts for the seats.  You took like two and a half seats.  Thank God you never see black or Hispanic people that are fat. 
[00:21:30]  Very few, my man.  Very few.  We're very, you know, thin, muscular, athletic peoples, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Ride the E-Train, bro.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, the E-Train.  What's on the E-Train?  Oh, yeah.  There's some fatties on the E-Train.  All right, man.  There's some big mamas on the train, you know what I'm saying?  But come on, man.  Yo, me and my brother, we sit down sometimes to watch Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  No lie.  Every male contestant that gets on the hot seat is fat. 
[00:22:00]  All of them.  And they take up mad space in the train.  And if you want to do, if you like trying to, you know, position yourself comfortably,  because it's like a six, you know, it's like a six-minute ride from Grand Central to 14th Street,  and then that thing stops in the middle and all that, and then they smell.  You're right, because the United States is a very overweight country.  Yeah, B.  You're right.  Let me tell you something.  If we ever get invaded, you're dead.  You're dead.  We've been invaded.  That's all I'll say.  Yo, Anthony, what you said, bro? 
[00:22:30]  Nothing, man.  You're tough on your big SUV, right, and your big police ID, man.  Yo, punk, man.  That's my word, man.  Driving through fields, fording rivers.  Yo, man, I'm upset, man.  Yeah.  You people got to get their infrared headphones.  Hey, Old Dirty, in your new job, you wear a suit?  No, I don't, actually.  Oh.  I'm plainclothes now.  Ah.  Hey, Old Dirty.  What's up, baby?  We have one of your fans on line one. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, you see what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Old Dirty.  Yeah, this guy sounds like one of them Italian cats from Brighton Beach.  I'm dead.  Go ahead, man.  Start berating me, breaking on me, man.  Yeah, Carnoli.  Joe, let's go.  Oh, sorry, guys.  Old Dirty's talking.  I couldn't hear over here.  I'm dying here.  Yeah.  Hey, I can't stand when Old Dirty calls up and has no friggin' idea what he's talking  about.  What?  White people are the only fat people?  What are you kidding me?  I get on the 4 and 5 train every day. 
[00:23:30]  All I see is fat effing black people.  Yo, yo.  Yo, yo, yo, what?  Old Dirty, you have a clue?  What's the matter?  You're speechless?  Yeah, man.  You left me speechless, man.  Yeah, all right.  I've got to remember what's going on on the 4 and 5 train these days, man.  4 and 5.  You worked on Wall Street.  It stops right outside Wall Street.  What Wall Street do you work on?  Hey, man, shut up, man.  I can't stop going in green, punk.  Man, typical ghetto boy, man.  Man, shut up, bro.  You didn't know you little guys, you didn't know you little white cronies walking around  Wall Street, diving through little alleyways, smoking a little joy during lunch. 
[00:24:00]  You smoked mad herb down there.  And who was smoking the white people's?  You got that, right?  My man used to deal to this cat that was like a major player in a major investment house,  my man.  Riding up little Joyce, looking all like the white trash cracker that he was.  Oh, Dirty, what does that have to do about it?  No, when you're going to come in front of me, then you're better than me, but you're acting  even worse because you're in a suit and you claim to be like the society and we're this  and we're in charge and we're all that.  Okay, terrific.  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:24:30]  You're not perfect like everybody else.  Shut up.  Hey, Oh, Dirty, you know, I just called to say that you have no idea what you're talking  about.  I had said nothing about me being better than you, but you just proved right cute to me, man.  You're freaking cannoli and mother flour.  Oh, wow.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Folks.  Thanks, old dog.  You just made my sense.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right, sir.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Here we go with this race thing again, bro.  I mean, why does the summer always got to get kicked off? 
[00:25:00]  You know what I'm saying?  With the second, oh, when he got in a movie theater, oh, and there's 15 kids.  And blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know what I'm saying?  Where do you go to the movies, old dog?  Me?  Yeah.  I go to mostly Hispanic and black theater.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Old Dirty, Chris from Bell Atlantic.  Yeah.  You guys stay thin because you're running off with the 27-inch TVs.  Oh, my God.  No, bro, I haven't even gotten in there yet, son.  And they got 27-inch TVs up in there?  You know corporations like to buy Sony's, kid. 
[00:25:30]  Sony's is good.  Sony's is good.  Sony's is the best.  Is that their new ad campaign?  Come to the live.  Sony is good.  Sony's is good.  Sony's is good.  Barry, what's up?  Yo, O.D., the only reason you are on the way is because we have the money to buy the food.  Yeah, and?  And that's why we're overweight.  You have the money to buy the food.  We don't have to scratch around trash pails for food. 
[00:26:00]  What happened?  We don't have to scratch around trash pails for food.  This one do my people scratch around in trash pails, bro.  Yo, B, look at you.  You've been up in Harlem.  You know what that seems like up there.  What are you talking about?  My people's eating?  Hey, man.  My people's eating?  Thanks to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  I hear you.  Wick and all that.  All right, man.  Bring it.  Keep it real, yo.  What's up?  Wick, baby, Wick.  We're doomed as a nation.  What are you talking about, Ed? 
[00:26:30]  It's all good, bro.  We're just doomed as a nation.  Why are you saying that?  We're never, ever, ever going to get along for something.  You know why we're doomed as a nation, bro?  Why?  Because the gap between the have and the have-nots is widening, my brother.  Why?  Bro.  Bro, the white people could...  Yo, there's a certain segment of the population that controls 90% of the wealth, bro.  How did that happen?  Gee, you asking me?  I don't know.  Maybe it was through hard work and ingenuity.  Yeah, right.  The first white man that landed on over here, yo, they robbed the Indians, man. 
[00:27:00]  What you talking about?  You're the first thieves.  Oh, please.  That was back in the olden days.  The olden days.  That was like the beginning of a Monopoly game where you're just like, buy, buy, buy.  No one pays attention to that part.  People came over here and monopolized everything.  The way the world was years ago was you went, you conquered, you grabbed up real estate,  and now that the earth is more civilized, I hope.  Yeah, for the most part.  For the most part.  Yeah.  You know, people that have their land, you know, pretty much have to fight for it, 
[00:27:30]  but it's not as widespread as it was at the beginning when it was just go there, conquer, own,  until you're conquered again.  It was the early part of civilization.  That's how it worked.  Will you deny what's written in the history books?  Did the white man come over here and rob the Indians?  Rob?  Essentially.  We came over.  Yeah, he came over.  We saw some real estate.  And we got for $24.  You know what I'm saying?  That was back.  There it is, bro.  That was back when the strong survived and when the strong got what they wanted. 
[00:28:00]  That's the same mentality for right now.  No, it is.  Dude, we are the most powerful country in the world.  We're not going over to the other countries that aren't powerful and invading them to get  their real estate.  What'd you do with Puerto Rico?  What'd you do with Puerto Rico?  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  Castro would have had your asses if it wasn't for us, okay?  Oh, what do you mean Castro?  Yeah.  You don't think under the umbrella of the U.S., communism and Cuba stayed out of Puerto Rico? 
[00:28:30]  Please.  Give me a break.  Yeah, true, true.  I'll give you that.  I'll give you that.  All right.  Well, we got some great instant feedback coming in for you, O.D.  Oh, great.  Marie from Brooklyn writes, was Old Dirty the one who sold the cocaine to the weatherman  from Channel 2?  Oh, you heard about that?  Yeah.  What a punk-ass mother-effer, yo.  And he doesn't, I don't, yo, they must have been tagging his dealer.  They must have been watching that, brother.  I mean, come on.  Snow today.  Snow every day. 
[00:29:00]  W.H. from B.  O.D., who you kidding, bro?  The only thin sister I know is a crack whore.  Oh.  Joe from Jersey wants to know how many grandchildren you have.  Me?  Yeah.  Man, my kids ain't have kids yet.  How many kids you got?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Well, one that I could document.  Oh, God.  There might be a few little O.D.'s running around, man, but, you know, I mean, it's all good,  man.  Maybe we'll all meet up one day at the clinic or something.  All right. 
[00:29:30]  Gary from Brooklyn.  Ask Old Dirty about the fat Puerto Rican chicks in spandex.  You can see stains on their asses as they eat their fried bananas.  Oh, you know you white boys like the fat asses in the spandex.  There ain't no fat ass that belongs in the spandex.  Oh, my God.  I am just reading what the listeners are writing.  Wow.  Giles from Connecticut.  Syndication when Old Dirty lays off the crack pipe and gets a job.  Keith from Manhattan.  The black and Hispanic movie theater is the showroom at the Wiz.  Yeah, that's true, though, man. 
[00:30:00]  Sometimes you go to the Wiz, you catch a good flick, son.  It's all right, man.  You know, on a Saturday, you go shopping, you know.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to the Wiz.  I tried to get some service at the Wiz during the Knicks playoffs against, who are they playing,  the Pacers?  Pacers?  Yeah.  I swear to God, I could not get help.  I could not get help.  I was like, I need an A-B switch.  I was just there recently.  They have like 50 people working, too.  Dude, they were all in front of the huge brand-new TVs, man. 
[00:30:30]  I could not get help.  Checking out another Knick victory.  We're talking about that tonight, man.  Well, as long as we keep you-ing out of the lineup, we're in good shape tonight.  Yeah, no doubt, man.  I think it's been proven that the Knicks are a running team.  They're a better offense without Ewing.  We're going to need his help when we have to face the Shaq attack.  Yeah, man.  It's time to deal with Shaq.  But that half-court setup just wasn't making it.  It's definitely a schoolyard ball team, and it looks good on TV, man.  I say we rest Ewing for the rest of the week, get him sent for the Shaq attack, and we're 
[00:31:00]  going to the finals.  What do you think about that foul?  Yo, you saw how many times Portland have fouled him?  Not Portland.  About the Trailblazers?  Yeah.  We're talking about Shaq, yeah.  Yeah.  That was outrageous, man.  But getting back to this black one, you know, come on.  Sony's is better, kid.  Sony's is better.  It is.  And I don't smoke crack, man.  Crack is for the white people.  We know you're not a crack, kid.  You like the herb, but...  I mean, I don't even...  No, actually, I don't even smoke trees anymore, because I had to take a urine test from that 
[00:31:30]  Atlantic, and, you know...  Yo, Rick, shut up, man.  Something tells me you've got to take a urine test to get into an elevator.  Yo, you see, Rick, Rick, I mean, Rick, you might as well put a price tag on you and just  put on sale.  You are just like the biggest sellout, man.  Rick is a sort of Rican.  No, he's not even sort of Rican.  He's like, yo, Rick, bro, don't be ashamed of your people, man.  Don't be ashamed of the brothers that eat rice and beanskin and going to go to a Puerto 
[00:32:00]  Rican Day parade, man.  Dude, I'm not ashamed of anything.  You are, man.  I am not.  You are, man.  You know what's shameful is to listen to you open your mouth and babble some days.  What happens?  It makes you freak out.  You're ashamed of me, aren't you, Rick?  No, I'm ashamed of people like you.  You're ashamed of me, bro.  You say it.  Bring me into your clique, dude.  I don't want to be associated with people with, you know, okay, you know, I'm counting on  the...  Speak English, for Christ's sakes.  I can do it.  Ricky, baby.  Ricky, Ricky.  Rick is 100% Puerto Rican, and look, he speaks like a... 
[00:32:30]  Both parents put the glue over when they were kids, so they were born there, and I've  got to listen to this.  And there are some third and fourth generation Puerto Rican families here that...  Who can't even speak English.  Right.  Now, Rick, you would never know there's a Puerto Rican...  Right.  By the way, he talks.  And then they wonder why they can only get jobs washing dishes.  Oh.  Because...  Oh, right.  Because people are going to come down on them for that.  I like that.  What?  Am I speaking the truth in some...  I'm not saying every single Puerto Rican can only wash dishes. 
[00:33:00]  I have to agree with you.  Yeah, thanks, thanks, guys.  Hey, old Dirty.  What's up?  Rick is lightening his hair, too.  He's white.  He's getting a little blonde in there.  He's like Michael Jackson, this freaking guy, bro.  He keeps a cow in the backyard.  In the morning, he just stands in front of it, and the cow licks his hair up.  That's a cow lick.  Puts a little setting spray.  Yeah, well, at least I don't have to chase my dinner around.  You're with the chickens there. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, man, I'm going to get me a cup.  I'm going to get me a chicken, bro.  All right, listen, listen.  We got to finish with old Dirty.  John, what do you have?  How are you doing?  What's up, guys?  You're on with old Dirty.  Would you like to talk to old Dirty over here?  Yeah.  Yeah, old Dirty.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  You related to Angel and Angry Puerto Rican, right?  Yeah, but we're angry people, bro.  I mean, what?  All you're crying and moaning.  Ain't nobody crying and moaning.  Oh, shut up.  You sound like Dr. Smith with all your whining. 
[00:34:00]  You like to touch the young boys, don't you, old Dirty?  Oh, I don't like hairless young boys.  I like hairless young girls.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Hey, old Dirty, man.  I was at the road show the other day, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks for the corona, yo.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Love you, man.  Hey, thanks, John.  Hey, you guys are awesome.  All right, cool.  Well, we're awesome when old Dirty's not on the show.  Oh!  What's up?  What's up with that?  We're in a bag.  We're in a gun.  You're old Dirty, man.  Hey, Hogflogger from the Bronx writes,  O.D., how does the Knicks game look on my TV that you stole? 
[00:34:30]  You're looking good, baby.  It's our little desk on the screen.  We had to care of that.  Hey, O.D.  What's up?  How would you like to moan my lawn?  Huh?  Hello?  Hey, O.Dirty.  Yo.  How would you like to moan my lawn?  You passed.  Yeah, how much you gonna give me, man?  Someone wants to know, working at Bell Atlantic,  how many garbage pills do you empty a day?  Yo, I am a technician, bro.  The test, the testases that I passed. 
[00:35:00]  The testases.  All right?  The testases.  Yo, I'm an intelligent bra, man, bro.  Let me tell you something.  I love it.  Yeah.  I mean, I should have established my intelligence two years ago  when I started this whole, uh,  but, you know, I got, I got kind of re-routed.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  And now I have to continue in character.  Yeah, I hear you.  Sub-par intelligence.  All right.  All dirty talks in character. 
[00:35:30]  That's, yeah, exactly, bro.  But, you know, the testases that I took, my man,  the test, you see what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You gotta make things easy.  It's the testases, man.  All right.  I'm talking about more than one test, man.  That test was hard, my brother.  I hear you, old dirty.  All right, man.  We're done with you.  All right, bro.  I'm done with you, too, man.  You're cracking.  You colleague boy back there, man.  Go drink your free Coronas.  Yo, my man, I'm going to win me at 40 right now.  It's lunchtime.  Let's not forget, this conversation started with us asking  if you stole beer from our road show. 
[00:36:00]  No, I didn't.  Let the record state.  Okay.  We're going to pay that record right now before I hang up.  Did I steal beer from your road show?  Yes.  No, I didn't.  You got caught in the parking lot.  Keith helped you out, and you said, I'll play the tape back.  Then you walked to your car with the beers.  I had, like, five or six beers.  Right.  Did you pay for them?  Okay.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, man.  I left someone on the counter.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Louis, what's up?  Oh, my God.

[00:44:00]  A white Kia Sportage.  All right.  Cool.  Okay.  Nice.  Help out our listeners, will you?  Definitely.  All right.  Thank you, Monique.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  Wow.  The paper's got that jumper guy from yesterday.  Uh-huh.  You see that?  Yeah, I did see it.  I'm hanging off.  Just like described on this very program yesterday.  Breaking news.  We broke that story for the tri-state area.  Breaking news.  Wins was very envious of us breaking that news story.  Did you see them all up there? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  They were like, wow, how'd you guys do it?  We broke this.  Well, we have about a million reporters.  Breaking news.  People just tell us what's going on in the tri-state area.  We throw it on the radio.  You give us 22 minutes, we'll rob your house.  Right.  Lee Harris is pissed.  Yeah.  Lee Harris.  John Montone.  How did they get the story?  Right.  They were reporting that there was some kind of disturbance down there, and we had all 
[00:45:00]  the facts here.  We had all the details.  We had people live on scene.  Right.  Phoning in reports.  Opiate Anthony, your news leader.  Yeah.  All right.  One thing that pisses me off.  Yeah.  We're talking about things people do that pisses you off.  Yeah.  Lee from Jersey writes, one thing that pisses me off is when the Dominicans put Sosa all  over their cars.  Don't they realize by now that the white guy, McGuire, always hits more home runs than Sosa?  Oh, my God.  What a racist beginning of the show.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  It's getting a little out of hand, huh?  Mm-hmm.  What pisses me off is Red Sox fans who actually have pride.  Yeah.  You know, for how racist the beginning of the show has been or how it's perceived like  that by some people, I guess, we're just like talking.  It's an open forum.  To add a little to the other side, this is a quote from the Reverend Al Sharpton.  This is great.  Wait, do we have the Reverend Al's music?  Yeah, we'll give you the music to the quote. 
[00:46:00]  You won't believe it because, I mean, we've said a lot of stuff here on this show.  We take calls from people.  It's an open forum, like we said.  And some people might think we're a little harsh on some of the minorities in this city.  I got to defend us.  I don't think that's the truth.  I don't think so either.  And I think most minorities that listen to us don't believe that.  Are you true?  I think what we're talking about are things that are observed, things that people live  with on a daily basis.  That's it.  We attack whitey, too.  Of course. 
[00:46:30]  So this quote was in the Post today.  On a daily basis, when we're talking about people that are doing stupid things, it's white  people.  It's spaz.  When we...  Spaz is as white as they come.  Yeah.  But get this.  This is from Reverend Al.  Direct quote.  I'm not kidding.  White folks was in caves while we was building empires.  We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got 
[00:47:00]  around to it.  Reverend Al Sharpe.  Wow.  Wow.  So we was in caves while black people were building empires.  Black people taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek  homos...  Those Greek homos.  ...ever got around to it. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, boy.  That's a big belief with the, like, I don't know what you'd call it.  What, black extremists?  Like a black revisionist history, I think you'd call that?  Is that before civilization?  Like, wait...  It was?  Yeah.  It was before...  Before civilization.  Before recorded civilization that we have on this earth.  Sometime way before that.  There's no...  There's no record of it.  There's no temples or monuments built or machines that have been uncovered of this pre-history history. 
[00:48:00]  But before any of that, blacks in Africa had an empire.  They had this huge empire.  And we're teaching things like mathematics and astrology, philosophy, and building things.  Well, maybe the archaeologists just haven't found...  Haven't dug deep enough?  Haven't dug deep enough to find the empires. 
[00:48:30]  We found dinosaur bones.  For the love of God.  We found everything.  My God, it's a duh.  And what happened?  Come on.  What happened to this industry?  This empire?  Every empire that has been on the face of this damn earth...  Has been found?  Has been found!  I mean, Jesus!  Even Jacques Cousteau, I think, found a piece of Atlantis. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  I can't find any record of industry in Africa.  Like, as far as a pre-history history before Socrates and the Greek Empire and the Roman Empire.  There's nothing there but trees!  Get out of here!  The stuff that is being written down today.  But that's a revisionist history on the part of the black extremists. 
[00:49:30]  Well, we'll see what the black people have to say about it.  Maybe there is.  Maybe they have some facts that you're unaware of, Anthony.  Maybe!  You never know.  Because there's supposedly this huge empire and a kingdom and princes and kings and all.  I've heard about this for years, but I haven't seen any record of it.  Reverend Alley, he seems to think, before the Greek homos, there was plenty...  That's hilarious, though.  He should be a stand-up comedian. 
[00:50:00]  How the hell...  He should.  Wait a minute.  How do you honestly come out with a statement like that when there is no...  And don't get on the effing phone and tell me Whitey covered it up, okay?  It's a big X-Files conspiracy.  Cancer man covered up the entire black kingdom and empire from before recorded history.  What the hell are you doing?  I don't know, Rick.  I can't go with your lead on this one.  I don't know what you're getting at.  No, we wanted the Indiana Jones music, man, so we could find the black...  Find the lost black empire. 
[00:50:30]  That's the one you shouldn't put in there.  Indiana Jones and the Black Temple of Doom.  That would be a good one.  Right.  Short round.  What's that?  It's a cold 45.  Oh, stop.  Come on.  It's a fun comedy show.  Give me a break.  I am just probably recording this to get off the hook that he's a racist.  Now, listen to what they're doing over there.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  That'll be the next Indiana Jones.  We'll go to Africa and find the lost empire of Reverend Al Sharpton.  The black empire.  The black empire.  Reverend Al will be in charge.  Like the guy from the Temple of Doom, remember?  Trying to pull his heart out.  Give me that heart.  Give me some real...  Oh, please.  What about Egypt, you a-hole?  Ding, ding, ding.  Okay.  No, you know something? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  If Al is referring to Egyptians, no.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.  We're talking sub-Saharan Africa.  Please.  And everyone knows that.  Give me a break.  Egyptians just have a real good tan.  It's true.  Jesus.  It's true.  Oh, my God.  What the hell happened to you over the weekend, man?  I had a very bad time at the Pavilion movie theater. 
[00:52:00]  You had a very good time in Boston.  You saw a lot of white people.  Oh, stop.  And you re-thunk your...  You know what I'm talking about.  You re-thunk your thoughts here.  If you go and look at Africa as a continent, there is sub-Saharan Africa, and there is Saharan Africa, Egypt, and...  What?  Oh, stop.  George wants to add to Reverend Al's comment.  George, what's going on?  Yeah, listen.  I'm Greek, and I just have to say, that's kind of BS. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, you homo?  Hey, hey, watch it.  I don't screw sheep there.  As opposed...  That's as per Reverend Al Sharpton.  Well, I mean, listen.  If Africans want to take credit for Egypt or whatever, give Greece some credit.  We...  Not only did we invent math, we invented philosophy.  We invented...  Philosophy?  Philosophy.  Philosophy.  I think you could order that in a diner.  Hey, watch it.  There was no greater philosophizing than came from Socrates. 
[00:53:00]  Socrates, correct?  Easy.  Socrates.  You guys were a bunch of homos, though, dressed in your little butt.  Well, I'm not going to comment on that, like I said.  But, uh, listen, we invented philosophy.  We invented democracy.  We invented a lot of stuff.  And you invented the diner where you could get eggs any time.  I love the Greek diner where you can go in, it's one in the morning, I want two eggs  over easy with sausage.  It's there.  And your greatest invention, souvlaki.  Souvlaki.  Yo.  I love the souvlaki with the white sauce. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Thank you, George.  All right, man.  Bye.  Well, we're not done with us.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony, a lot of people, uh, you know, checking in with things that, uh, people do  that piss them off.  Yeah.  Uh, Glenn from Queens, what pisses me off when an a-hole stand in front of the stairs  in the subway during rush hour.  Oh, yeah, great spot to stand, dickheads.  That is so true, though.  Yeah.  They walk in, uh, people that walk into a store or something and just stop right at  the door.  Right.  And don't let you, why would you stop right here? 
[00:54:00]  Everyone's coming in here.  Move out of the way.  Jared from Oceanside.  One thing that pisses me off is when all the Dominican Yankee fans root for Pedro Martinez  at the Yankee games.  I've noticed that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know he's one of your boys and he's a great pitcher, but God damn it, aren't you  a Yankee fan?  We're supposed to hate the Red Sox.  We do.  I have noticed that.  We do.  Jared, bravo.  No, that's true, though.  Yeah.  The Dominicans do that all the time.  They root for, uh, their own, their own boy there.  I just love, uh.  I don't care what race you are.  We're supposed to hate the Red Sox in New York. 
[00:54:30]  I love the Sox fans.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Shut up.  We so kick your ass, like, every year.  Mark, it's just pathetic.  And you could say, we sock, we sock.  We rule.  Shut up.  Stumble.  Do it again.  Sox.  Go Sox.  I love the Sox.  You have the Yankees, you New Yorkers.  Shut up.  We got a history teacher on the line, Anthony.  Mark.  Mark, what's going on? 
[00:55:00]  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to add some perspective to this historical discussion being on the history  teacher.  And I just wanted to say, one thing about civilizations is, one of the great marks of them are that  they have writing of some sort.  Recorded history.  Yeah.  They have five characteristics, and one of them is writing.  So, if there was these great civilizations that, uh, Reverend Al was talking about, we  would have something on them.  But, uh.  Yeah.  You know, they're just, there are none.  And, you know, anyway, they can't write today anyway. 
[00:55:30]  So, uh, how are we going to do it back then?  Jesus.  Thank you, Ron.  It always, it always gets to that level.  We're trying to stay on the subject.  Things that people do that piss you off.  Yeah.  Ryan, the intern from Staten Island.  What pisses me off is when Patrick Ewing is healthy.  So true.  Keep him out of the lineup.  And we go to the finals.  What about the Zulus?  They kick the, they're saying, what about, Anthony, what about the Zulus? 
[00:56:00]  They kick the British ass.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  When you're outnumbered, eight billion to one.  Like, the most British is talking.  You ever see that movie?  Zulu?  Yeah.  Oh, it's in seven.  We were just talking about this movie over the weekend.  The English guy's like, hey, hey, tight, gents.  Everything you need, I'm fine.  All of a sudden, it's like, thousands and thousands.  Thousands of Zulus piling over on top of these guys.  Yes.  Stay dignified, man.  Everything can be fine, man.  Yes.  Wiped out. 
[00:56:30]  Dude, you're.  Psychomach, you are so bad.  And you're distracting us, man.  It's not, you're.  Psychomach is the, is, is the biggest racist.  Yeah.  Yeah, but we can't say anything on the air and you're just distracting us.  It's so horrible.  You can't say what you're writing.  You can't even write it.  Oh.  All right, real fast before we move on.  Lisa.  Lisa, you're next.  Lisa.  W.  Hi.  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yes, Lisa.  How are you?  Good.  You know, I know your discussion is about, you know, what ticks us off, what people do. 
[00:57:00]  What pisses me off is when white people try to hide behind their racist mentality by saying,  it's just a joke.  Ha, ha, ha.  I don't understand that.  I mean, if you're going to be a racist and if you're going to talk about what you believe,  admit it.  But don't hide behind.  Ha, ha.  We're just a show and we're just, ha, ha, ha, joking.  Yeah.  The things we've talked about have been true issues.  So what do you have a problem with?  But you know what? 
[00:57:30]  You're just perpetuating.  Oh, shut up, Lisa.  You're just adding to all the drama that we already have in this country.  So, so.  And people like you are not helping you.  Shut up!  But let us talk, too!  And you can't tolerate criticism.  Conversation, you let someone else talk.  You don't even let us talk.  No, but you're going to let me finish.  So when Chris Rock does his act, it's okay, right?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  First of all, Chris Rock makes a lot of fun of blacks, Hispanics, whites, and everyone. 
[00:58:00]  He doesn't just focus on that.  But I've been typing for about an hour and all I'm hearing is jokes on Hispanics and blacks predominantly.  And yet you have covered yourself by saying you talk about whiting.  But you know what?  You're not helping us on.  You're not.  Has it been all jokes or have we addressed issues that people are, you know,  hey, we go into a movie theater and we have a problem?  What, we're not supposed to talk about it?  Yeah, I agree with you.  And you know what?  I'll be honest.  I'm a black woman.  And I've had black people movie theaters talk. 
[00:58:30]  I agree.  You know what?  I've had white people do it.  And I've had white guys sit in the parking lot with their beer cans and so forth and so forth.  And it's just as equally annoying.  But I don't focus on the fact that they're white.  I focus on the fact that they're people who are ignorant and don't know how to act.  So what about Reverend Al's comment about the Greek homos?  Are you sure that's him?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Positive.  It's right in the paper.  You know what?  All I know is from history, I teach.  I teach. 
[00:59:00]  I'm also a teacher.  Yeah.  And from history, I know the Ethiopians had a very strong rule.  Is it open?  No, it's not.  What?  The Ethiopians had a...  Yes, yes.  The Ethiopians.  They were very civilized.  Start the train.  Start the train.  For the love of God, start the train.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes, they were.  And you could look that up.  The Ethiopians.  Yes, yes.  Hey, Lisa, the next time we make fun of Whitey for, like, the whole show and have Spaz on it for four straight hours...  No, no, no, I don't want to make fun of anybody.  Okay.  Well, then don't listen to this show.  Don't listen to this show. 
[00:59:30]  But Whitey must be focused on the fact that they're white.  Don't listen to this show.  Tune in K2U.  Don't listen to us, then, because this is what we're going to do.  Go listen to K2U.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Here comes the 406.  Oh, damn.  Oh, that kind of hurt.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:00:00]  You know what the funny thing was, Opie?  That whole conversation she had, she was on a cell phone at the movie theater.  That was pissing somebody off.  All right, yeah, we definitely have to take a break.  You touch on any race issue, people get so sensitive.  Whatever.  If you listen to this show on a regular basis, you know exactly what we do.  Please.  We move around the ball field big time.  Uh, Dave from Jersey, I hate when someone leaves a floater in a public toilet.  Oh, my God, really? 
[01:00:30]  What happened?  It hurts so much coming out, your arms don't work, the flush?  God damn.  I hate when they leave a crime scene in the stall.  Screw the one lousy floater.  You see those crime scenes?  Put the yellow tape up, yeah.  Oh, my God.  They called the authorities to dust for prints.  Yeah.  Someone looked like they took a salad chute full of pudding to the place.  All right, a bunch of things going on.  Taking your phone calls, 212-757-1027.  Honestly, try not to get racist here. 
[01:01:00]  We're just asking the simple question, what do people do that really piss you off?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what race.  Uh-huh.  Give us a call on that.  We have a WOW sticker stop happening at 4.30 with Spaz and Gorilla Boy Jeff Norris at GameStop Route 22 in Union, New Jersey.  Expecting a huge crowd out there.  Starting at 4.30, get your brand new WOW stickers, okay?  Yes.  And ladies, as we speak, are flashing their boobs all over the highways, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of reports of WOW-ing going on today, and we love hearing that, okay?  Beautiful whip them out, Wednesday. 
[01:01:30]  We're going to regroup by giving away some wrestling tickets, and we'll get back to the phones and talk to you guys next.  But right now, 10th caller gets a pair of tickets to see the WWF June 24th at the Garden.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, the Diamond Exchange.  Yeah.  We met the fine folks of the Diamond Exchange just before the show today.  Yes, we did.  Thumbed through the catalog.  Wow.  You know, I thought it was just, like, engagement rings. 
[01:02:00]  Uh-huh.  And stuff.  All kinds of custom jewelry.  And diamonds.  Yeah, they brought in a few pieces.  They take pride in their work.  Very, very creative stuff.  Yeah, real beautiful stuff.  You know?  No, it was funny.  I know they're cool at the Diamond Exchange because, see, the salespeople, they bring clients down to our office.  All the time, yeah.  Our office is a freaking mess.  I know.  There is stuff on the walls that should not be seen by the normal people out there.  You ever see Animal House when Dean Wormer walks into a Delta House?  Yeah.  And they're all, like, hiding the beer bottles and everything? 
[01:02:30]  That's what we're like when they bring clients and we're like, oh, good.  Yeah.  Naked pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, just kind of disgusting sex videos all on the wall.  Yeah, we just put it all the way smoothly right in front of them.  Yeah.  And we didn't have time.  The salespeople didn't give us the warning.  Yeah.  And there was just stuff all over the walls and just the rest.  And they came in and they were cool.  I'm like, all right, these people must be cool then.  All right.  Yeah, Diamond Exchange.  Go down there.  You want to do something special. 
[01:03:00]  And they do have engagement rings, too, you know?  And you get the beautiful diamond, handpick it out, custom mountings.  And they help you choose.  Exciting collection of the most beautiful, unique, and custom-designed engagement mountings you'll ever see.  And the latest contemporary platinum jewelry.  And what else, Opie?  I'm looking through this.  I got totally flustered by the invisible man.  Am I right? 
[01:03:30]  For over 12 years, the Diamond Exchange has been the Tri-State area's premier source for diamonds and fine jewelry.  Yeah, and the Diamond Exchange staff will help you choose from an exciting collection of loose diamonds  and the most beautiful, unique, and custom-designed engagement mountings that you will ever see, Anthony.  That's what I saw.  All right.  Basically, you've got to call the Diamond Exchange and check it out for yourself.  1-800-550-0633.  That's 1-800-550-0633.  The Diamond Exchange, Route 17 North in Paramus, New Jersey.  Come see yourself while their customers return again and again. 
[01:04:00]  The Diamond Exchange.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Home by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027-WNEW.  New York.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  We're in a great mood today.  It's Whiffle Mountain Wednesday.  Yeah.  It looks like we have picked up the pace.  A lot of people are getting flashed out there on the highways.  Thank you, ladies, for helping out the WOW movement.  Get the WOWs on your car, people. 
[01:04:30]  Doubles fan from New Jersey.  Hey, ONA, how about sending the van to the Meadowlands tomorrow night to give out WOW stickers at the Stanley Cup Vinyls?  Give us, Devil fans, some loving.  Sounds good.  Yeah, we should get the van out there, the WOW van, to get out WOW stickers.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, and go Devils go.  Big win last night for the Devils.  Yeah.  Got to support the Devils, Anthony.  Of course. 
[01:05:00]  No, we're Devils fans, right, Ed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Today.  Go Islanders.  Bandwagon.  Jumper.  Islanders in the Stanley Cup in the year 2010.  Let's go.  Get on the bandwagon.  Come on.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we should do that with the WOW van tomorrow.  Yeah, get down there.  If you want to get a WOW sticker today, GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey.  Spaz and Gorilla Boy, Jeff Norris, we'll be there within 10 or 15 minutes, all right? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Alex on the phones.  Alex, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  All right.  I'm over here now in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  You know what pisses me off?  Yeah.  When I ride on a train, you know, I take a train every day, and there are beggars all  the time, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, you have change sometimes, sometimes you don't.  And, you know, they really get an attitude when you don't have a change, when you don't  have any change.  So that pisses me off, you know?  Well, I like the beggars that work for their change.  Well, I like the beggars that work for their change.  Some little old dude was playing the trumpet on the end. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that I like, too.  That's pretty cool.  I actually give them dollars and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Then that's when you break it out.  Yeah.  You know, they're working it.  Because they're actually earning it.  What about the guy who holds the door for you at the ATM?  Oh, that's a good one.  They're the stupidest beggars in New York City.  Because you have no money, you're going to the ATM, you're not going to give the guy a  10 on the way out or a 20.  It's usually only denominations of $20 bills.  Right. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  You're broke, so that's why you're going in there.  And you're holding the door hoping you're going to give him something on the way out.  You don't have change.  Right, and it's not like those guys are some paralyzed or physically disabled people.  They look perfectly normal to work, you know?  Yeah, well, that was worth $20 holding the door.  Right.  And now that the warm weather is here, I notice that the 30-year-old high school students are  selling the candy bars to go to Washington again.  You see that?  It's two blocks away from us.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of bozos that work here at N.A.W. that fall for it.  And every time we go to lunch, I'm like, look at them. 
[01:07:00]  They're not in high school.  30-year-old high school.  I'm serious.  That's great.  Want to buy a candy bar?  We're trying to go to Washington.  No, you're not.  Yeah.  All right.  Syndication, I'm over here now.  All right, Alex.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Oh, and A.  Yesterday, my sister was listening to Z100, and they were talking about putting a Z-free  money sticker on cars.  Z-free money sticker. 
[01:07:30]  And then they're like, if you have a sticker that says WOW, take it off, because it won't  get you anything.  Oh, yeah.  Only boobs.  A WOW sticker will get you a lot more than a Z-free sticker.  What losers?  A Z-free sticker?  A Z-free money sticker?  Do you think any...  That is the stupidest thing.  Do you think anyone wins money on those stupid bumper sticker radio station campaigns?  That's why we did WOW.  Yeah.  It's a no-brainer.  It's...  People give you something, boobs, just for putting the sticker on it. 
[01:08:00]  It doesn't have to be someone from the station driving around.  Let me explain something about radio.  We'll take down the curtain again here, Anthony.  Yeah.  A station like Z100, okay.  So they have these Z-free money stickers.  Z-free money sticker, everybody.  Get your sticker on.  We're going to be giving you cash.  Cash.  So they're hoping to get maybe a couple thousand stickers out there.  Mm-hmm.  And they'll give prizes to maybe 10 to 20 people. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Tops.  Yeah.  I guarantee, as we sit here on this fine Whip-em-Out Wednesday, that hundreds upon hundreds  of people are seeing stuff on the highways because of our WOW stickers.  Won't get you nothing.  They are so jealous of our WOW sticker campaign.  Have you seen how many cars come in and out of this city?  Have you seen the traffic?  Do you know the numbers of cars that are driving on this road?  What are the odds that you're going to stick a Z100 sticker on your car and someone from 
[01:09:00]  that station is going to see it and what?  Like pull you over and give you money?  Pull you over and give you Britney Spears tickets or something?  There's a better chance of getting pulled over with a gun to your head and someone taking  a car in this city than there is of you getting money.  See, the WOW sticker's cool because it's the potential of every girl with boobs is the  one that's giving you the prize.  Right.  It doesn't have to be someone that works here.  Instead of one prize van giving out money, we have thousands and thousands of women that 
[01:09:30]  are willing to flash guys that have WOW in their car.  That's the beauty of it.  And the only reason they're bringing it up on that stupid station is because they are  very, very jealous of our bumper sticker campaign this fine season.  Because let's face it, wherever you go, you're seeing WOW.  You're seeing WOW.  Yeah.  That's it.  It doesn't have to be...  You don't have to bump into anybody except a woman with boobs.  They're giving away the prize.  And just to put it in perspective, do you guys realize we ordered 150,000 brand new WOW stickers? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Guess how many we have left?  How many?  Practically none.  Really?  We're going to have to reorder.  Practically none.  Well, I'm seeing them all over the place now.  We're putting another rush order in to get more stickers because this is how hot this damn  WOW thing is.  And I've seen a bunch of people with the homemade versions.  We love the homemade version still.  Still.  I'm very flattered when I see the homemade WOWs on the car. 
[01:10:30]  It's Whip Mount Wednesday.  It's a beautiful day.  Get the WOW on your car.  So they can say whatever they want, but they're goddamn jealous of this radio station, our show,  and our listeners that are just going nuts over this WOW thing.  Yeah.  Get that WOW off your car.  Get the Z100 sticker on there.  That'll get you something.  We're paying you to listen to us.  Z100.  Z100.  And if you want to get a WOW sticker, self-addressed stamped envelope.  They're still coming in like crazy. 
[01:11:00]  Like Backstreet Boys fan mail every day.  We get the big, huge post office freaking sack filled with self-addressed stamped envelopes.  Speaking of ridiculous other radio station stuff, you see the new commercial with that  Small Doan chick and Terry Garr for Light FM, I guess it is.  I joke with Sandy about it all the time.  It is the lamest crap.  If you're a radio guy, that is the biggest embarrassment in the world.  Yeah.  Terry Garr is sitting there with that Small Doan, I guess her name is. 
[01:11:30]  And she says, here's how easy it is to play the music and not talk some kind of happy horse  crap like that.  And Small Doan reaches over and pushes a button, doesn't say a word, and folds her arms.  That's her monkey ass job.  And shrugs.  And shrugs like, that's all I do.  That's all I do.  That's it.  So I guess she was getting pissed.  So now there's an ad where she actually talks.  Uh-huh.  But she's like, and that was some, you know, crap, insert crap band here, on Light FM. 
[01:12:00]  And Terry Garr and her stuff.  It just, I swear to God, when you see her and Terry Garr sitting in those seats, all you  want to do is burst, bust in the studio and spray them with banana juice.  I swear to God, I want to step on the console like a monkey in a cage and just spray them  with banana juice.  I'm moving in now.  I know, Dice.  That's your line.  We know.  We know.  I could do the entire job with a dildo in my mouth.  Can I say that?  I'm over here now. 
[01:12:30]  I know, Dice.  I'm Small.  What's her name?  I'm Valerie Small Don.  I can do this entire job with a dildo in my mouth.  Because I don't have to talk.  I just have to press buttons.  Where's Terry Garr?  Terry Garr.  She was hot for ten minutes.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, she's old now, yeah?  I guess.  She's been around forever.  She only needs one hand.  I could diddle myself and seg songs with a dildo in my mouth. 
[01:13:00]  All I need is one arm.  Our guest DJ today, Christopher Reeve.  And we don't even have to do anything different to the studio.  He's just got to roll up to the console.  All right, I'll do another visual impression.  I love your visuals.  Okay.  So do the people.  It's good at the audio impressions, which is very important if you're doing a radio show.  I'm good at visuals, though.  Yeah.  All right.  This is my impression of Christopher Reeve. 
[01:13:30]  Christopher Reeve.  DJing the show.  Okay.  And he has to hit commercials.  Right.  Okay.  Wait, I need my seat lowered.  It's a visual bit, of course.  Yes.  By the way, as we get ready for the visual impression, that's as low as it goes.  I need a...  Is there another seat?  Give me a stinky seat.  Where's the short chair?  If you want to get one of these WOW stickers, self-addressed stamped envelope, WNEW, 10th floor,  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, attention WOW sticker. 
[01:14:00]  I think that address is on the WNEW website.  All right, my visual impression of Christopher Reeve DJing, and let's say it's Light FM.  Okay.  All right.  Here he is.  Ready to go into a Celine song from Spots?  Okay.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  We need the Celine song.  Okay.  Where's the Celine song?  Because, like, when the music ends, the jock has to do the clever seg that you don't even notice at home.  They're pushing the button in between songs, and it's so smooth, so seamless. 
[01:14:30]  Uh, you don't even notice.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  So, Opie will do Christopher Reeve as the stand-in DJ for Valerie Smoldone.  Yeah, we're just trying to find Celine Dion.  Sorry about that.  Am I loaded here?  Oh, yeah.  What's the cap in here?  All right, just hit, uh.  Okay.  Here's Celine Dion ending and Christopher Reeve.  Ending.  Christopher Reeve.  At Light FM.  All right, Opie's wheeled up to the, uh, to the board. 
[01:15:00]  Got chest high.  All right.  There's the song ending.  And, uh, eyes moving back and forth.  It's looking troubled.  And dead air.  Is just sitting there not moving.  That is just horrible, man.  So, I guess Christopher Reeve couldn't officially DJ Light FM. 
[01:15:30]  Valerie Smoldone is better than Christopher Reeve.  Is what we're learning here.  Because if the song ended, he still wouldn't be able to do anything.  So, he can push the button.  All right, here it is.  Now, look.  Oh, God, look at his eyes.  His eyes are looking very distressed.  Very troubled that he can't hit the button.  I'm trying to put the mic on.  You're horrible, man.  Thank you.  Valerie Smoldone.  Thank you, Anthony.  I could, uh, diddle myself.  Have my hand on a big, giant, uh, piece of man meat.  Uh, have a dildo firmly emplaced in my mouth. 
[01:16:00]  And still play the songs and get approval from Terry Garr.  Well, Ant, this is a first making fun of Max, my crotch.  This is a first making fun of other radio shows and other radio jocks.  And they don't belong to our company.  This is good.  God damn it, we're going to buy them.  And before we end this break.  Yeah.  If you ever see Anthony and I in dresses, advertising for our show on TV, 
[01:16:30]  please drive up to the station and shoot us in the back of the head.  Oh, God.  The, uh, what is that?  Scott and Todd.  That is embarrassing.  In dresses.  How pathetic do you have to be that you're going to be dressed in drag on TV  to promote your stupid radio show?  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  Just strap on the friggin' appliances and go at each other's butts.  Ugh.  With the dress and then the big punchline is that they were just, what, dreaming or something? 
[01:17:00]  Whatever.  What was that?  I don't even know how it goes.  And then one of them, Todd, is still wearing a dress.  You can pretend you're dreaming, but you're on TV wearing dresses.  Wearing dresses.  And I hear that's like a big commercial all over the United States in different markets.  Yeah, well.  Like the Slappy and Wappy show in Phoenix does the same commercial.  Yeah, for all you PLJ fans out there, you know, if you are fans of their show, you're like,  oh, wow, man, they're so creative.  Look at their little, you know, TV commercial promoting their morning show.  Yeah.  No, see, that commercial's done all over the country. 
[01:17:30]  It's just different jocks and different, uh...  It's a formula commercial.  Different dresses.  It tested very well in our research, so we have it in all different markets.  We just can't do the same spot in overlapping markets.  Got it.  And if Scott Jennings gets another facelift, he's going to have a you-know-what hanging from  his chin.  A schlong.  I got a schlong hanging from my chin.  There's a schlong.  Look at this.  I'm squeezing my sack on my neck.  I'm like a big rooster.  Why do you need so many facelifts if you're on radio? 
[01:18:00]  I look like Foghorn Leghorn with a scrotum on my chin.  Oh, brother.  All right, Dan, we have to take a break.  Yeah.  We have a nice surprise for everyone right now.  Mm-hmm.  As Whip'em Out Wednesday continues.  We got some clips from our road show from last Thursday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Some of the highlights were some of the guys performing their most offensive songs at.  Yes.  A lot of video clips, a lot of brand-new video clips up on foundrymusic.com today. 
[01:18:30]  Steve got the clip of Stephen Lynch doing FBA up there.  It's hilarious.  With the additional verses.  It's amazing.  Absolutely hilarious.  www.foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Okay?  Right.  But right now, here's our buddy, our pal.  He's a rock star.  Fuel, live from our road show in front of about 2,000 people singing a song you all know  and love.  Mm-hmm.  Baby Raper.  Gentlemen, start your wacky.  Are you mashing me naked? 
[01:19:00]  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, it just makes me tingle.  Booze.  The world's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  Wonderful now, Wednesday!  Bobby and Anthony.  The brain is in their pants.  Yeah.  1027 WMEW.  Yeah, at least we admit it.  212-757-1027. 
[01:19:30]  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on, man?  Hey, how are you doing?  We're having fun today.  I just called because I had a little bit of a complaint.  You know when you did that last visual with Christopher Reeve?  Yeah.  You know, you're supposed to entertain the millions of listeners, not the five people in the studio.  Yeah, I know.  But I was cranking up to visualize it in my own head.  There you go.  Well, you paint the picture in your own head.  That's why that kind of works.  Come on.  You know, I was thinking, though, one thing.  Maybe Christopher Reeve could do it.  You know, like they put those big, long straws in those people's mouths that can't move any other part of the body. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  And you can push the button of the long straw.  All right.  Maybe that can help them.  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you.  Syndication don't care because I live in New York.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you're next on N.E.W.  I think Tom's at the sticker stop.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Guys, I'm in union.  Hey, guys, you're on N.E.W.  I'm on the line.  Yo, uh.  They don't even look.  Sorry, man.  Your van, they just crashed it into a piling in front of the store.  They didn't crash it, did they?  Dude, I am not lying to you. 
[01:20:30]  There is a big dent on the side of your van.  Back in full school.  Guys, ONA's on the line.  Who is driving?  Uh, I can't tell right now.  You've got to be lying.  They should be calling us every minute.  Dude, I am not lying to you.  Oh, they dimmed it, though, van.  All right.  Was it Spaz driving?  Spaz was driving the wow van today?  I heard Spaz is the worst driver in history.  Hold on, Tom.  Hold on.  Look, he's targeting himself.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  I got Joe from GameStop here.  He said he knows you.  Hey, all right.  Put Joe on.  Here he is.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  How you doing?  Oh, something happened with the van.  Oh, they got hung up on.  Oops.  What happened with the van?  They better be calling soon.  They'll call.  All right.  Well, we've got to make an announcement.  Yeah.  Too much is going on with this radio show.  Yeah.  You guys, the faithful listeners of the Opie and Anthony show, stop giving us pot.  Thank you. 
[01:21:30]  We don't need any pot.  No more pot for the boys.  We're crashing vans.  All sorts of crap is going on.  Unbelievable.  Do you really think Spaz crashed the van in front of GameStop?  I don't doubt it.  From what I hear, he is the worst driver ever.  So why don't we allow him to drive the wow van?  All right.  Well, let's hear.  Let's hear how it wasn't his fault.  All right.  We've got Spaz on the line.  He's at GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey, giving out the brand new wow stickers.  Spaz. 
[01:22:00]  Spaz.  Yeah.  Why don't you turn the van off?  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  Great.  What happened to the van?  People called in already?  Yeah.  What happened to the van?  I just got here, and, well, Big Kev was directing me onto the curb.  So he will say it's not his fault.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  It wasn't his fault.  It's just a minor, minor, minor thing.  What happened?  Well, I kind of scraped.  I kind of, like, well, I was trying to jump the curve, and the mirror just slammed into 
[01:22:30]  the door, and I kind of, it's just a little scratch on the side.  It's no big deal.  Like I'm Ward Cleaver, and he's frigging Wally.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Just tell me what happened to the truck.  I kind of just, it's just a tiny scrape on the side against the stone pillar.  That's what that's right.  Against the stone pillar, just a little scrape.  How?  Give me the exact dimensions of said scrape.  Well, I'm about to exit the car. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  I'm going to pull the van, and I'm going to check out the damage.  Okay.  Oh, there's a van.  I'm going to go around the front.  Excuse me.  So he was saying it's nothing before you even look.  Yeah.  Go.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Look.  It's just a little scratch.  It's just a tiny scratch.  Spouse.  Oh, no.  How big?  More than a foot long.  A foot long.  About a foot.  Oh, my God.  Know how much money that cost to paint up that wow van? 
[01:23:30]  Dude, we just got the van painted.  Did we need this little plastic thing in front?  What plastic thing?  It was a plastic thing that's at the edge of the car door,  between the edge of the car door and the tire on the passenger side.  Yeah.  It was a fender.  Oh, the whole fender thing?  It was a running door.  It's the running board.  The running board came off?  Well, it's hanging by a thread.  You are too much.  No, no, no. 
[01:24:00]  It's really not that bad.  It isn't that bad.  It's expensive.  I can wipe it off.  All right.  This is the deal.  Whose email is available right now?  Because people go to these appearances now with the digital cameras.  Someone send us a picture of the van so we can check it out very well.  Someone get their digital camera, upload them to a site,  and email us the address to the web space that it's in.  No, just, they could do it through the instant feedback.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Yeah, do it through the instant feedback.  Get a picture, a digital picture of the van.  We've got to check it out.  We're not waiting for Spaz to get back to the station.  You, you, you, I'd say maybe it's about 50, 60 bucks damaged tops. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  50, 60 bucks.  There's no such thing.  You ding someone's door and that's a couple hundred.  It's not dented or anything.  It's just a little, it's just like a little scrape.  And what about the running board?  A little dented.  Hey, Spaz?  What?  Spaz.  Yes?  Okay.  You hit a wall.  Yes?  Wait, let us talk to the listeners.  Someone's saying you hit a whole wall?  Who said they hit the wall? 
[01:25:00]  Is Jeff Norris there, Gorilla Boy?  No, Big Kev's here.  Hold on.  All right.  Gentlemen.  Big Kev.  What's up?  Tell us exactly what happened.  Okay, here's what happened.  We're pulling up onto the sidewalk that's in front of the store, right?  Yeah.  It's a wide sidewalk.  The van can obviously fit on it.  And as we're pulling up, there's a little, one of the little handicapped  accessible ramps.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You know, that's built into the curb.  Yeah.  As Spaz was coming up the curb, when his first tire was on the ramp,  the second tire was caught, if you will,  because the ramp, obviously not wide enough for the whole van.  Yeah.  It was caught.  And he, a little, perhaps, overzealous.  Ah, Goose did it.  Jumped up the curb.  Yeah.  Hit the gas, perhaps a little too much,  and accidentally, slightly, kind of, hit the stone pillar that's holding up the awning. 
[01:26:00]  God.  Right.  Good, good.  It doesn't look that bad, I mean, to me, but you've seen my car, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, your car's a mess.  How many people are out there, Kev?  There are several hundred people out here.  All right.  And they are all witnesses.  Very good.  Put Spaz back on the line.  Okay, hold on.  Thank you, Big Kev, helping us out at the sticker stop, GameStop, 22, Union, New Jersey. 
[01:26:30]  They're all laughing at Spaz right now?  Get your wow stickers.  Hello?  Spaz.  Yeah?  Are they laughing at you?  Um, yeah.  Um, people recommended that I get shoe polish or spray paint.  Uh, Spaz?  Yeah?  Ken walked into the studio.  He wants to talk to you.  Ken?  What the hell was that?  Uh, just people just screaming because you guys are, uh, bashing me.  You sure?  Or did a girl, like, flash?  No, there's no girl flashing here yet.  Oh, yeah, man. 
[01:27:00]  Uh, Ken wants to talk to you.  What, Ken?  Yeah, he's not too happy.  I'm sorry.  I, I, I, I, I came, I came head on into the sticker stop.  I didn't expect that.  And, and, and I was, I could, I had to get over the curb.  And, and I ended up with up the gas.  And, and who put the pillar there anyway?  Kevin, what happened?  I, I, I, I, it's just a minor scrape as if you would fell down and skidded your knee.  I, I, I was trying to jump over the curb. 
[01:27:30]  Spaz.  And I hit the gas just a little too far.  Whiner.  Spaz.  Yes?  Ken's in the studio and he wants to talk to you.  I'm going to get a wet paper test.  I can clean it up.  What, what happened, Kevin?  I, I, I tried jumping over the curb and I hit the gas.  This, this will come out of your pay.  The side, the side of the door is just a little scrape.  Ah, you're a tool.  And then so was the side of the mirror.  Ah, quit, quit, quit whining.  You're whining like a child.  Yeah, give out the wow stickers.  Ah, okay.  All right.  If anyone can get a digital picture of the damage to the van, please email it to the instant feedback for us. 
[01:28:00]  Everyone's suggesting we put the damages on his credit card.  I have $4 left.  All right, Spaz, have fun out.  $4.  It's cosmetic surgery.  All right, Spaz, at GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey.  You're giving out the wow stickers.  Oh, God.  Someone sent me a link.  I hate these people.  What?  Somebody's spreading.  Hey, it's Mark Brown.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[01:28:30]  I hate you, man.  Ben from Long Island.  Thanks.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, I know something that I really hate.  Yeah.  I've season tickets to the Yankees.  Yeah.  And every time I go, it never fails.  It's some cheap-ass, no-ticket-buying mother-effers are in my seat.  Yeah.  Don't you hate that?  And then they'd look at you like they have an attitude.  Yeah, they'd get annoyed.  They're like, oh, you showed up.  This is my seat.  This is now my seat.  Well, it's even worse.  They give you, like, the badass look like, I ain't moving. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  Even after you show them the tickets, I own the seats.  And then you get an usher.  And now it's awkward because the usher has to, you know, chase them out of your seats.  Right.  And you know they're waiting up on the four-train platform.  Yeah.  There you go.  So that's pretty good.  All right, you guys.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Very good.  Spazzle whiny.  He hasn't been on the radio in a while, so he figured out, you know, he'll crash the van  and get some air time.  Good way to get some air time, really. 
[01:29:30]  Brian, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, I don't know the story yet because I've only seen a commercial for the 5 o'clock newscast,  but apparently the city is going to decide to pull the Big Apple double-decker buses off  the streets.  Yeah, I heard that on WINS.  State suspends Big Apple licenses.  So I guess you guys are a small step closer to taking over the world.  Thank God.  Yeah, those double-deckers have got to go.  All right, guys.  Indication when the old bag dies.  All right, thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Here's people working in Manhattan trying to circumnavigate our smelly, smoky buses. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, this just did it.  The state has shut down New York Capital Tours in New York City.  The governor announced today that an investigation by the State Department of Motor Vehicles,  Environmental Conservation Insurance, and Transportation determined there were hundreds  of violations against the company.  What are we going to do on our vacation now when we go to New York?  God damn.  Too bad.  I wonder how many people actually threw feces at them like we recommended. 
[01:30:30]  I'm sure.  They drive around like we're monkeys in a cage, like looking.  Look at the people walking down the sidewalk.  They're real New Yorkers on their way to work.  Look, he's got the newspaper and his cup of coffee.  All the rubes from Oklahoma on the top deck of the bus with their video cameras.  So I figured that we could all act like real monkeys in a cage and just fling feces  at them and start spanking our monkeys right in front of them.  Give them some real video to take home.  Joe from Queensland.  Spaz crashed because the invisible man distracted him. 
[01:31:00]  That could happen.  Yankee bleacher creature.  Can anyone at the godforsaken station drive an effing van?  Jerry Lewis from Manhattan.  Spaz's debt has now surpassed 50K.  Add it to the tote board.  Things that annoy me.  Morons who can't drive and run wild vans into poles.  I just got a job driving for the tour bus company.  This is terrible.  To supplement my income.  Beba?  What are we going to do, Beba? 
[01:31:30]  Beba.  Well, at least he got there on time.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Hey, Lynn, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  I wish you much happiness on this year's weekly holiday.  Ah, yes.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Have you flashed anyone yet today?  No, I haven't.  Actually, I have two gripes, if you'll let me air them both.  I wish you guys would extend Whip It Out Wednesday to women as well.  I mean, you ask us to flash you guys.  How about you guys flashing us?  Why don't you spread the joy? 
[01:32:00]  Well, for some reason, when a girl shows her boobs, it's really cool,  and everyone can handle it, and it's great.  When guys start flashing their junk, the police get involved and haul them away for exposure, you know?  Public exposure.  It's just the way it works.  Yeah, double standard, but that's the way it is, so.  Well, at least you guys acknowledge that it's a double standard.  But on to my original gripe.  And it's Whip Them Out Whenever at this point.  Okay, all right, I'll buy that.  You say, wow, you flash them.  The nature of my work forces me to drive all over the place every day.  And nothing raises my blood pressure more than people who just hang out in the left lane 
[01:32:30]  and drive, oh, 15, 30 miles an hour.  And this is on the Bell Parkway.  I'm sorry.  They should save their self-righteous indignation for the right lane where it belongs.  Get your sorry-ass hoopty out of my way.  I have work to do.  We've addressed this many times.  It's the people in the left lane that don't know till I get over.  I don't understand it.  I'm constantly scanning my mirrors, you know what I mean, looking behind me to the side.  If I see I'm in the left lane, I have a clear road in front of me, which never happens, by the way. 
[01:33:00]  And I look in my mirror and I saw a line of cars.  Wouldn't you think maybe I'm holding up traffic?  Oh, they're oblivious.  I swear to God, they're oblivious.  They're in their own little world.  Sorry.  Oh, you cursed there.  They're not oblivious.  Anthony brought it up yesterday we started on this little topic.  Yeah.  There are a lot of people out there that think they're the most important person in the world,  and they don't give a crap about anyone else.  Yeah, this is true, too.  But, again...  Ant and I have a very simple driving rule. 
[01:33:30]  It's called get the F out of the way.  Right.  If you're in the left lane, I don't care if you're going 55, 60, or 80.  If there's a car on your bumper, you're the problem.  Move to the right.  Someone wants to go 100.  Let them do it.  There you go.  Exactly.  It's their ticket.  It doesn't matter how fast you go on the left lane.  There are people like, well, I'm in the left lane, and I'm doing the speed limit.  You're the problem.  As I said, save the indignation for the right lane.  Get out of my way.  Well, I'm glad that you gave me this opportunity to vent this.  I'm hoping that some of these people will recognize themselves and get that. 
[01:34:00]  They're not listening.  They're not listening.  Get the hell out of the way.  All right.  I love the old people.  Thank you, Lynn.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Dude, when you finally do pass that slow car on the left lane, you've got to give them the look, you know?  You, like, give them the real stare.  Have you ever looked and seen a dead person driving the car?  Yeah.  Like, all of a sudden, you're like, who has been in front of me doing 10 miles an hour?  You go to speed pass, and you slow down quick so you can look, and you go, oh, my God, it's a corpse. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  There is a dead person driving.  And I saw that today.  Guys smoking a cigar and all oblivious.  Like, you can't understand why I've been honking at them for the last, you know, three, four miles.  They're translucent.  You see a very dull pulse in their temple through their milk skin.  And the hat, they've got the old man hat on.  The jaw is, like, dropped down.  They're just not moving, not blinking.  It's a dead person driving.  Big bony knuckles.  Don't forget, they've got the Terminator glasses on.  And they don't even look at you.  They're not looking.  They have blinders on.  They're looking straight ahead at an open road. 
[01:35:00]  Is this really Don from Fox & Friends?  Don?  Don.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Is it the Don from Fox & Friends?  That is the Don from Fox & Friends.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  You're trying to help us out today?  Yeah.  I'm on the left lane, but I'm all going 15 miles an hour on the West Side Highway.  Well, that, you know, whatever.  Yeah.  We're all doing it.  Hey, listen, everybody's lined up in front of Big Apple Tours on 48th and 8th.  All over there.  All the major network guys.  Oh, really? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  How about that?  So you want us to get some people out there wowing?  I just think that it's important information that everybody knows that the network folks  are all hanging out over there.  All right.  Just walk by there, you know?  Look, the 5 o'clock news, just ready to start up.  I'm sure that will be one of the top stories here in New York.  Lots of live shots down there, 48th and 8th.  Please, get on TV.  We'll invite you down and give you a little prize package.  Let's go one step further here, Anthony.  Oh, you want to?  Yeah.  If you get the wow on TV, that's great. 
[01:36:00]  And we want to see that.  If that's all we're going to get today, it's fine.  What?  Go.  The amount of day rolling out onto the tomat.  Yeah, let's get the A-bomb.  No, no, ladies, ladies.  Oh, my God.  Live boobs on live TV today.  Come on.  Perfect, perfect opportunity, 48th and 8th today.  You do it.  They're all doing live shots today because it's a big story.  Big Apple tour is closing down.  Help us out.  Live boobs on TV.  Flat out, Ant and I will give you cold, hard cash.  Cold, hard cash.  Nice.  And lots of it. 
[01:36:30]  Funny how it's just two blocks south of the Ranch 1 that gives out the wow stickers, too.  Do you think that's kind of ironic?  Oh, there you go.  Cold, hard cash.  First girl showing their boobs on live TV today.  We got a great opportunity, 48th and 8th.  Hi.  Hello, Don?  Don?  Is Don on the phone?  Is Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Ponderous.  His phone.  Hi.  It's a song.  A little dog named Snuggles. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Can we do it again?  Take two.  Every time, I got to go out of an up-tempo number into a goddamn death dedication.  Hi.  Two, two.  48th and 8th.  48th and 8th.  Release the hands.  Get this stupid MTV off.  I want to see some live TV.  See if anyone's brave enough to show boobs on live TV.  And if you wanted organized people, you have a cell phone and a friend, give us a call. 
[01:37:30]  We will tune in the station and walk you through the wowing.  Live wowing on TV today.  Come on.  We love it.  Today is the day.  Cold, hard cash from your pals, Opie and Anthony, if you do it.  We're set up.  We'll be going to a live shot very shortly, 48th and 8th.  Let her rip.  Plenty of news, Cruz.  Going live.  Going live.  God, I will laugh my ass off if we see naked boobs on the network news.  Oh, dude.  Come on.  Today's the day.  Anthony, really fast.  Before we take a break.  Yes. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, there's our live shot.  He's very hot.  All the news people.  Where is he?  He's on like the roof of a building.  All the news people are on the top of their vans.  I'm telling you, that's because of our damn radio show.  They are all scared assless of us.  That was a different story, though.  He was doing something on that.  That's all right.  Get in the second story window.  You'll be at the same height as the reporters.  The NBC guy right now is horrified.  He is up.  It's got to be 20 feet above the street somehow. 
[01:38:30]  They got him in a cherry picker.  The second story is as high as him.  Yeah.  He's frightened.  He's on a tightrope.  I'm telling you, that's because of us.  Because we do have some people that work for the TV stations.  And they're like, you guys have everyone's scared ass.  Oh, look.  Tour is suspended.  Tour is suspended.  Wait a minute.  Channel 4, if you see that NBC thing go live, you've got to go crazy, people.  I want to see boobs.  Yeah, they're on a tape segment now.  Yeah, they're on a tape segment.  They're going to be doing live reports during the 5 o'clock news, the 6 o'clock news. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Let her rip.  Let's go to Alex really fast.  Alex, what's going on?  I saw the guy standing on top of the truck on Channel 4.  It wasn't even for the thing.  It was for, like, press examinations.  Yeah.  He was standing on top of a loud truck to get to report about press examinations.  Yeah.  Kind of ironic, isn't it?  Oh, wait.  Go to 7.  7.  I said stay.  7.  Oh, crap.  All right.  The guy on Channel 7 is right on the sidewalk, right outside Big Apple Tours, 48th and 8th. 
[01:39:30]  They're going to go back to him, right?  They're going to go back to him any second.  If you see him, you push your boobs on TV, I will give you cold, hard cash.  Yeah, we'll give you cash.  Thank you, Alex.  I'll see you guys later.  Syndication with our DJs telling themselves.  All right.  Thanks.  How much we got, you think?  I don't know.  How much can we scrape up?  Trust me.  No.  We have enough people that are...  A few hundred.  I'm talking close to a grand I'm going to try to get.  Yeah.  You've got to get naked boobs on TV.  I've got to see when they go to the live show.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to happen. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Someone...  Dying on me.  I am dying on me.  That's probably the shot now.  All right.  Hang up on all these people because there's people trying to do this for us.  Yeah.  If you've got a cell phone, you're really close to 48th and 8th.  We've got to clear some phone lines so people can possibly get through.  Yeah.  We'll talk you right through it.  We will talk you through the wowing.  Could you see how they would freak out if they see live boobs on a network news broadcast?  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  It's a real long tape segment.  You know they're all on DEFCON 1 or whatever.  All right.  They're going to go live any second.  I mean, I don't think we have anyone out there right now, but they're going to go live for the rest of the afternoon.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  Also, on the way, on this radio show, we're playing some of the songs that were performed live at our road show this past Thursday in front of 2,000 people.  The live versions, yes.  The live versions.  All right.  He's live on the sidewalk right outside Big Apple Tour. 
[01:41:00]  See, this would be perfect.  Girl just jumped out.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Just walks out that doorway, shows her boobs, and she gets cold heart cast from O&A.  It doesn't look like this chick's going to flash.  No, no, no.  The old bag.  I don't think it's going to happen this time.  He's frightened.  Well, they're going to go live.  They've got a tight shot, huh?  Yeah, they're going to go live at 530.  There's one of our listeners, you can tell.  He's smiling at the door.  Come on.  Ah, we cut away.  All right.  All right.  We'll try to make this happen.  Yeah.  They're going to be doing plenty of live shots. 
[01:41:30]  48 today.  First girl to show their boobs live on TV today.  Cold heart cast.  And on the way, Stephen Lynch performing FBA Anthony.  Yeah.  In front of 2,000 people, the extended version from our road show.  It was huge.  I think we're going to do it right after break.  And really fast.  Did you see the story?  I think it was in the Daily News.  Yeah.  New York 1.  Screw New York 1.  Who watches New York 1?  Why?  Mark ran down there?  Oh, there you go.  Here, let me see if I got him here. 
[01:42:00]  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, what's up?  Are you down at 48 today?  I'm on my way there right now.  It's 48 tonight, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm about halfway there.  I'll call you right back when I get there.  Dude, talk a girl into going live.  They'll go live at 530 as well.  They're going live at 5, 530?  They're going to be live at 530 and 6 o'clock.  Oh, beautiful.  I'll be there.  All right, man.  Let us know what's going on.  Yeah, I will.  All right.  Now we got our reporter on the scene.  We'll get something going.  All right.  We'll get something going today.  Hold hard cash. 
[01:42:30]  First lady showing live boobs on TV.  Did you see the story in the post?  It was either the post or the Daily News.  A French brother and sister vowed yesterday to continue their fight for the right to keep  their dearly departed mother in a freezer in their home, Anthony?  Yes.  We went to El Mazeal.  What do they mean?  They're saying they can't be separated from their mother, who died last July and has  remained in a morgue freezer since then.  Can you say dysfunctional freak family?  Holy smoke.  They put her in a glass-sided freezer at the morgue, and they go and visit her, and they 
[01:43:00]  want to move her body to their home.  Yeah.  And have it on display in, like, the basement or something in this damn freezer.  You ever have a blackout in your house?  You ever see what happens to, like, your tapioca if it's left overnight with a blackout?  You open up your freezer, it's like a war scene with your ice cream melted onto the bottom  of it.  Imagine what the mother would...  Although it is French.  Might not smell.  Come on. 
[01:43:30]  We all know the French don't shout out.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they want to preserve their mother in a glass-sided freezer in the basement of their  house.  Yes.  We want a big hole left in the glass where her vagina is, so she can continue to be a  hell bag.  I mean, what do they...  What do you want your dead mother?  That's sick.  That is really sick.  I'm horny for dead mothers, because dead mothers stink up our basement.  Oh. 
[01:44:00]  What a...  It's obvious.  How old are they?  They're in their 50s.  They're in their 50s, brother and sister.  Unmarried teachers.  Let me tell you.  They are banging each other.  They're banging each other.  I'll say it definitely.  These two are definitely having sex with each other.  Yeah.  They still live in the same house where their mommy lived.  Their mommy dies, and they want to keep her in a glass-sided freezer in the basement.  In the basement.  Norman, she's a whore, Norman.  And their teachers, they're arguing in court that more than 100 Americans have their bodies 
[01:44:30]  preserved by freezing.  Who?  Even though the United States doesn't allow frozen corpses to be kept in homes.  We think we are suffering injustice.  French law is the toughest in the world with regard to this.  Because he's dead.  Says the sister.  Hmm.  Yes.  Oui, oui.  Isn't Walt Disney on ice?  That's the rumor, right?  Walt Disney on ice.  They can just set her up like an animatronic thing.  Who the hell wants to...  That's morbid.  That's insane. 
[01:45:00]  You know, someone's dead.  Wouldn't that give you the heebie-jeebies if you're in the basement and all of a sudden  the lights go out?  Oh, yeah.  And you're like, oh, dead mommy.  And it's pitch black, and I don't know where I am.  Where are you?  Oh.  Come here, son.  But I'm dead.  It's awful cold, Jimmy.  Mommy's cold.  Get mommy a blanket.  All right, you're freaking me out.  Oh.  Precious.  Shut up.  Precious.  Shut up.  Get mommy. 
[01:45:30]  I'll be a hug.  Jay, what's going on?  Jay, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I'm on Grand Concourse in the Bronx.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're doing all these news reports, the older vans, so I double-topped the car,  write the wild sign, and get burn-mushed by the Channel 2 producers.  Ah, really?  They're on to us.  Yeah.  Take them over.  So, listen, two city cops, they're on bikes.  Spread the sign for me.  Say, move your car.  We're going to try to get the sign on to you.  Oh, cool.  All right?  Yeah, we've got to get some live boobs on live TV today. 
[01:46:00]  So, it's kicking as soon as possible.  Thank you, Jay.  Later.  Really fast, Jeff Norris.  The real story about the van that spazz crashed.  Gorilla Boy, what's up?  What's up, man?  Make it fast.  We've got to take a break.  From that one, let me drive.  You've got about $700 damage at least.  See, $700 in damage from spazz crashing the wow van.  Let me tell you something, guys.  I did one better.  I came in my truck, and I don't bring a dented van.  You know what I brought?  I brought Trish from the road show, and she's getting the crowd going.  Watch this.  Hey, Trish.  Give him a flash.  Hey, let's hear it. 
[01:46:30]  Huh?  Yeah, say, folks.  Good draw.  It's a mob feed, and we've got food.  Oh, that rocks.  Huh?  One up for the Gorilla Boy.  Two down for spazz.  Yeah, Gorilla Boy gets the job done.  Thanks, Jeff.  All right, man.  All right, there he goes.  GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey.  A little party's breaking out over there, Anthony.  Yeah.  As they give out the brand-new wow stickers.  Psycho Mark, he's at 48th and 8th.  We're all over the place again today.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark, what's going on down there?  Hey, they even got Telemundo over here. 
[01:47:00]  Telemundo.  Telemundo.  So what are our odds of getting boobs on live TV today?  Boobs on live TV?  Majorly good.  The only problem is I have no boobs to go with me.  See, well, we need a lady to go find Psycho Mark.  He'll help you through it.  He'll help you through it with the cell phone.  We will work as a team, and then he will bring you down here, and we will give you cold, hard cash.  So go see Psycho Mark over there, 48th and 8th. 
[01:47:30]  Every TV station is there.  They're all going live from the sidewalks and live from on top of their news vans.  They're all here.  Actually, they're on the sidewalk.  They're not even on top of the vans yet because they didn't realize I was here.  Oh, wow.  Well, just kind of be incognito, dude.  Yeah, you know what that's like for me.  Incognito.  At the worst, you've got to get on live TV today.  Oh, absolutely.  With a loud band.  All right.  I don't get punched in the face by one of the reporters.  Well, call us when they're going live, all right?  All right.  All right.  There goes Psycho Mark.  This always gets ugly. 
[01:48:00]  God damn.  This is great.  And now it's just like a whole slew of news crews down there.  And are you feeling it today?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, the blood is pumping.  I'm feeling all uncomfortable, like something horrible is about to happen.  I love it.  And make sure it's like Channel 4 or Channel 7 news.  Yeah.  Leave Channel 2 alone.  Yeah.  We don't want to get in trouble.  We could just tear the hell out of Channel 4 and Channel 7.  Well, any other station.  Channel 4 going live at 6.  We know that.  They're going live all over the place.  Yeah.  There'll be live shots at 5.30 and 6 o'clock.  We need boobs. 
[01:48:30]  See Psycho Mark.  He's down there.  And like we said, cold, hard cash.  Cold, hard cash, ladies.  48th and 8th.  Go look for Psycho Mark.  But don't go screaming, hey, Mark, I'm here.  Yeah.  Keep it on the QT.  Channel 4 just had a huge promo for the Big Apple Tour closing down for their 6 o'clock news.  There you go.  So gear up.  You've got plenty of time to get down there.  All right, Ant.  We might as well play the freezer prank call we did from our Dementor World CD.  For the flesh?  Mommy, put mommy in the freezer. 
[01:49:00]  That is so sick, man.  I know.  When people die, just put them in the ground or cream it.  What the hell do you want your dead mother downstairs?  Oh, like Pepe Le Pew.  Wait, should we play the freezer phone call or the dead guy that wants to watch the Super Bowl prank call from Dementor World?  Hey, a twofer.  Which one do you want to do?  The dead guy because it makes more sense.  We'll do the freezer one a little later.  This damn CD, by the way, is still selling like crazy, even though you can't find it in New York. 
[01:49:30]  Here it is from our CD Dementor World.  It was during the Super Bowl when Green Bay was in the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And some guy's father died.  Check this out.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Okay.  My name's Artie Milo.  Uh-huh.  And my father had recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know.  Two, three days ago. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family.  Uh-huh.  And we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, temporarily, you know, prop them up.  Uh, in the big chair.  So when the family comes over, he'll be okay until after the Super Bowl and then we'll bury him?  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl.  And we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would, you mean not get him until then? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump them with whatever you do and, you know, preserve them until after the bowl.  No, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl.  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn.  But, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping, and I don't think he's going to make it until Sunday.  Now, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully, no one.  But we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and maybe open up his hand so we can put a beer in there. 
[01:51:00]  And we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home.  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position.  You know, it just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard.  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later?  No, I'm afraid we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  You see the pack in the bowl with his family, and we got the big screen TV and the chair for him, and he went up and died. 
[01:51:30]  We will not do that.  If your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to do that.  You have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away.  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin?  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able, you know, like, if there's no problem as far as preserving him. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  And could you put, like, a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack...  Well, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house, depending on how, you know, how well he preserved he was and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down.  Right.  Okay.  Do you think that's, like, degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went. 
[01:52:30]  Bye.  Get ready for...  Ooh!  And we've allowed for Wednesday with the lady and Anthony!  N-E-W.  Anthony, time out New York, the obsessive guy to impulsive entertainment.  Yeah, this is what you pick up at the newsstand if you want to figure out what to do in New York City, man.  Something cool and hip, you know.  Not to ride around on those damn double-decker tour buses that they just shut down anyway. 
[01:53:00]  So now all the rooves, they don't know what to do either.  Hey, go get yourself Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  It'll tell you what to do.  Run out now to the newsstand, pick it up.  Time Out New York's summer concert preview issue.  You plan on going to at least one concert this summer.  You can't afford to miss this issue, including a roundup of out-of-town classical music fests.  Will you be going to any classical music fests, Opie?  Uh, yeah, I would check that out, to be honest, sure.  A guide to free outdoor concerts. 
[01:53:30]  A little Shakespeare in the park, maybe.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Guide to free outdoor concerts, including Central Park's Summer Stage.

I don't know what you want me to do. 
[01:54:00]  Yo, show me a tease.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's going to be fun.  Boob is gigantic.  That's against the law.  It should be.  Oh, D and Anthony.  Whip them out Wednesday.  I just love being naked.  Oh, yeah.  And EW.  Wow!  What a great Whip them out Wednesday in progress.  Oh, yeah.  The sightings all over the tri-state area.  Coming in like crazy.  Very busy show, Anthony.  We have Psycho Mark trying to get on live TV at 48th and 8th.  Yep.  He'll be checking in soon. 
[01:54:30]  First girl to show her boobs on live TV.  Cold hard cash today from your pal Zopie and Anthony.  Cash.  Cash is right.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  What kind of cash are you talking about?  I don't know.  We're scraping up quite a few bucks over here.  My fiance is on her way downstairs from work right now, and he's up for it.  She wants to know how much, though.  Well.  We're at Fifth Avenue right now, and we're going to be heading down there.  So where's Mark at?  What's he look like? 
[01:55:00]  He'll be the psychotic one down there.  It's obvious which one he is.  Okay.  It's stupid to negotiate.  It's the first girl to do it.  We'll take care of her.  All right.  Cool.  We'll be there, then.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Simon.  Simon, you're next on NAW.  How are you?  Simon!  Simon.  Whatever your name is.  Whatever your name is that we're talking to right now.  Right now, you, you, you, you, you.  Speak.  He's there, too.  Jerry.  How are you, Jerry? 
[01:55:30]  Good.  I want to help you out with your pledge for cash, boys.  Okay.  I'm going to donate $100 to the first woman down there.  $100, Doctor.  Just to make your WOW day special.  All right.  Nice.  We're going to count on you if it happens.  Put me on hold.  I'll give you my address.  All right.  Cool.  I'll come down there and bring you the money.  Well, if it happens, just come down.  Okay.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on NAW.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  I was on, I listened to Z100 today, right?  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  And they said, now it goes Z100 and it gives out, get the Z100 bumper sticker.  No, I don't know.  Oh, well.  It said it'll get the Z100 bumper sticker.  It'll get you more than the WOW sticker.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  Yeah.  How jealous of those guys?  Wherever you look, there's WOW stickers.  Yeah, I know.  I never really see a Z100 sticker either.  Tell them to shut up and keep playing their stupid Britney Spears and leave it to you.  All right.  It's in the case or whatever.  All right.  Take care of you, guys.  Let's go to Rod.  Rod?  Whoa.  Rod, what's up?  Hey, Rod. 
[01:56:30]  Yo.  Hey, you're on the air, man.  Hello, babe.  Yeah.  Yeah, guys, man.  We were over at Union.  Yeah.  And we pulled up.  We got a VCR going, a camcorder going.  Yeah.  We got Spam's looking at the damage he did to the truck.  It is hilarious.  Oh, yeah?  Do you have the actual accident?  Hello?  His phone is crap.  Oh, God.  Phones.  Well, we'll get a copy of that video on the artificial website.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  Let's play FBA.  Yeah.  From the road show. 
[01:57:00]  Cool.  The live version.  The live cut.  We might have to break into the show because they could be going live any minute.  Yes.  From 48th and 8th.  Psycho Mark on hand.  So we'll start the bit.  If we have to stop it, we will.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  But Stephen Lynch appearing at another one of our road shows.  We thank him.  He did FBA in front of 2,000 people, Anthony.  Yeah, it's the extended version.  Yes.  His new CD, A Little Bit Special, is coming out in about a month.  It's going to be absolutely huge. 
[01:57:30]  21 tracks total, Anthony.  Cool.  A lot of the songs you know and love from this radio show.  Plus a bunch of new ones.  He's got a song about Jim Henson.  Oh, really?  Tall Glass of Water.  Jim Henson.  Mother's Day.  Ray Dawn Chong, which I've heard him do live.  Yeah.  Which is hilarious.  Bitch.  I think he's done that one.  Hair.  Track 20 is just called Gay.  But here he is at our road show doing the song that started it all.  F.  B. 
[01:58:00]  A.  In front of 2,000 lunatics.  I don't usually do cover songs, but this one's very special to me.  So I brought one of the co-authors of FBA, Mike DiNicola.  Mike DiNicola!  Mike has been kind enough to write a little extension to the song.  So if you listen closely, you might hear some things you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight.  Sarcoma popped out all over my face. 
[01:58:30]  I lost three teeth into all of my friends.  Looks like this time I'm hearing the end of your name.  Who needs a lie, no reason to fear.  When you're flat on your back, counting all your ribs.  I went to give blood, they just showed me the door.  I stood up to leave, and I fell on the floor full blown, eh. 
[01:59:00]  Everybody now.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore.  Yeah, damn that whore.  Let's break it down now.  Mike DiNicola's going to do a little spoken word.  A little poetry.  Because I know you guys can appreciate some good poetry, right? 
[01:59:30]  Well, the FBA has set in, and he's left feeling a little low.  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good.  So I'm going to go out and share it with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress, here's your tip.  That ain't acne above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave?  Well, that's okay.  I've got time to kill, maybe two or three days. 
[02:00:00]  I'm sitting alone humming the song.  I start to think about everyone who's done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  A fifth grade teacher.  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're going to find a hypodermic in your neck.  Patients in my restaurant.  What about them?  The tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that ain't half and half in your stew.  Oh!  And Wendy. 
[02:00:30]  You remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah.  You stood me up for prom.  But I won't infect her.  You won't infect her?  I'm going to infect her mom.  Her mom?  Bublone 8.  Damn that whore!  Damn that whore!  You little fucking whore!  You little motherfucking whore!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  F.B.  Bublone 8.  F.B.  Oh, my God.  That is so wrong.  God damn.  What is wrong with them?  There's a video clip of that performance on foundrymusic.com.  Many video clips from our road show from last Thursday.  What a brutal rendition of FBA.  I must say.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey. 
[02:01:30]  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  Yo, I was just going 21 north.  I just got off.  Two girls just flashed me the car.  Oh, cool.  I gave him the wow sign, man.  It was great.  Right on, man.  Congratulations.  What?  Congratulations.  Yeah.  All right.  Your car thing works.  Yeah, of course it works.  I love it.  I love it, man.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Listen how happy he sounded, Opie.  I see that.  He saw boobs.  He put the wow on the car.  It's as easy as that.  We don't have to spot you.  No.  It's not a wacky radio contest where, hey, if we spot you driving in the other eight million 
[02:02:00]  cars that are cruising around the area, we're going to give you, like, a hundred bucks.  Yeah, please.  All right.  And cross your fingers.  They're going live on all the news stations in the very near future.  Yeah.  Live boobs on TV.  Cold hard cash today.  The first sortie being flown at 530.  All the live shots at the, where is that, 48th and 8th?  Yeah.  By the New York Big Apple bus tours. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  Psycho March down there.  It's being reported that every single news station knows that he's there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're all pointing him out.  They're all pointing him out?  This could be a rumble on live TV today.  Psycho March!  Because he does not care.  You watch what he tries to do to get on TV today.  You know what's going to be almost as funny as Psycho March getting on TV?  Watching the defensive moves of the people on the live shots.  In the background.  They are going to be, like, in a phone booth.  Just closed in. 
[02:03:00]  The tight nostril shot so there's no one in the background.  This is going to be pretty funny.  No, you know what's going to end up?  Mark's going to become the Shane McMahon of the show as he tries to, and as they start chasing him,  he starts running away, but he's still talking tough.  He'll run away.  And he'll run from one live shot to another, so it doesn't matter.  The guy's got more balls than brains.  All right.  We're going to start our break.  Yeah.  If anything crazy happens.  What's going on?  Oh, wait.  We got Psycho March?  They're all on the roofs. 
[02:03:30]  Uh, Psycho March, what's going on?  Good.  They're going to the top of the trucks.  Yeah?  All the reporters are going up top?  Oh, yeah.  They're all...  They're moving to the top of the trucks.  Well, go far back.  Yeah.  I'm good.  Oh, no, I've got actually reinforcements down here.  If anyone's in the area, we could use a little extra help if you know what I mean.  And, dude, dude, they can't do anything about audio either, so if you're yelling,  OK, terrific, or FBA or something, we'll hear it.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I'll do my best.  Actually, I've got a bunch of guys here that are standing around.  They're going to help me out.  And, again, if you're in the neighborhood, we could use some more support. 
[02:04:00]  We could use about ten fingers.  Cool.  Top priority, let's go, what, Channel 7?  And then...  Uh, we've got a plethora up here.  I mean, we could really take our pick today.  We'd like to know where we can look.  How about Channel 2?  I heard they need a new weatherman.  Ah, leave Channel 2 alone right now.  Yeah, we're trying to get syndicated, believe it or not.  We've been good for a little while.  Yeah, we want to keep our streak alive of being good.  Yeah, pound Channel 4.  All right, dude, we're going to take a quick break.  Anything crazy happening, call us right back. 
[02:04:30]  We'll stop the break, okay?  All right, very good.  All right.  Bye-bye.  We'll start the break, Ann, but I know we're going to stop at any minute, so stay right there.

We've got to make that happen.  Cold hard cash to the first lady that does it.  All the news crews hanging out at 48th and 8th.  Big story, the states have suspended the Big Apple licenses for those double-decker buses. 
[02:06:30]  So they're all out there live doing their cute little reports.  We're looking for a lady to go down there.  And when they go live, flash their breasts.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  How you doing?  We're doing great today.  Yeah.  The giant plane is crazy.  I'm going to take the wow sign and fly it to Jones Beach at 12 o'clock and everyone's going to do it.  It's going to be crazy. 
[02:07:00]  Uh, what?  What?  My uncle has this giant plane.  Yeah.  A giant plane.  Giant plane, like a jet.  Okay.  I'm going to send it to Jones Beach with your wow sign on the back of it.  And everyone's going to look at it.  It's going to be crazy.  I think there's only one thing crazy with this whole thing.  What's so crazy about it?  And that's the guy on the phone.  I'm crazy?  Oh, gosh.  A big jet.  Cycle Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Mark.  What's up? 
[02:07:30]  What's up?  Hey, they still got one of them junky buses running around.  I just, I whipped out my junk at them.  Buses.  They still got one of them stink boxes going, the button down the street.  So no one has gone live yet?  Well, they're just, they're setting up for a press conference right now, and I've got  a bunch of people here.  And as a matter of fact, I don't think they might, they might be going live with some stations,  but they've got the, all the mics set up, and they've got some meathead from New York  Apple Tours here.  And he looks like he's going to give a little speech.  Oh, really? 
[02:08:00]  Dude, total disruption.  Yeah.  Total disruption.  Yeah, let's see how big your balls are today.  If they do a live.  They already all made me.  They're like, hey, Psycho Marks over there, watch out.  If they do a live press conference, you've just got to completely destroy it.  Oh, without a doubt.  All right.  Debbie suggested on Line 11, you put girls on the guy's shoulders to get on TV, because  I guess all the reporters are on the vans and stuff.  Well, they're setting up their setups from top.  Some of them are still on the ground here, but unfortunately, there's no chicks around  right now to flash their love with you. 
[02:08:30]  Well, maybe they're hiding, waiting for the, you know, the proper time.  Yeah.  Mark?  Oh, there he is.  All right.  Well, call us back if anything's going on.  We're all waiting patiently here.  God, we want to see this happen today.  Definitely.  It's going to happen.  All right.  Thank you, Psycho Mark.  Live at 48th and 8th today.  We'll see Bobich on TV.  Joe, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Joe, what's up? 
[02:09:00]  How's it going?  We're doing great.  Is this opening to Anthony?  Yeah.  Let's go.  How's it going?  I just want to tell you guys how elastic has found my true love.  What do you mean?  Well, I don't know if you guys remember.  I was in there with you guys, you know, messing around and stuff.  I took elastic home with me.  I ended up going to Dublin out in Long Island.  And I took it.  I was all messed up.  I took elastic and I just goes on like this low-cut shirt.  I just took the elastic and stuck it on, you know, the top of her breast. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  And it was true love from then on.  And you've been going out with her ever since?  Oh, yeah.  The wow sticker getting you laid?  Yep.  Got me laid and everything.  All right, Joe.  I don't know if you guys remember me.  I was talking to Anthony about the stinky pinky.  The stinky pinky.  The stinky pinky.  I remember you.  The stinky pinky was?  You were out of your mind, man.  I was.  I threw a nickel in some girls' cleavage that you were trying to get to wow everybody  and you were doing an auction.  Yeah.  And I just chucked a nickel in a cleavage. 
[02:10:00]  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  That's all.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:10:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:30]  What, GameStop, Route 22, Union, New Jersey?  I believe they're still there.  Well, we have an auto body worker on the line who wants to give us the estimate on the damage.  All right.  Tom, what's going on?  Gentlemen, how are you guys doing?  Were you down there?  Yes, I was there.  I got an S-load of stickers. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you so much.  I saw the entire thing happen.  I took a look at the van.  It's not just the front of the van.  It's the side door.  It's the kickstop.  It's everything.  It's totally about $800, I would say.  $800.  Yeah.  Someone else saw it, and on instant feedback, they're saying a solid grand.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I was thinking, you know, that's the friendly price, $800.  Stupid Spaz said, oh, it's about $60 worth of damage.  Well, I don't know if he told you. 
[02:12:30]  He covered it up with some wow stickers.  Yeah, it looks nice.  We just painted that damn thing.  Well, yeah, he asked it all up for you guys.  But Gorilla Boy is awesome.  He's going to bail the chick out.  You know, good stuff.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Bye.  Bail the chick out, Anthony.  I don't know what they even mean by that.  I'm sure Gorilla Boy will let us know.  Yeah.  What's going on with bailing a chick out? 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  Oops.  All right, someone just sent the picture of the van.  Ben.  Yeah.  Did you send it to instant feedback?  You said under the Steve address, correct?  Are you home?  No, I'm right here now.  Where do you want it sent to?  Instant feedback.  Where's that button?  Send a link.  Send a link, yeah.  On instant feedback.  What, go out to the van, you mean?  Oh.  Okay.  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thanks, Ben.  I can't, I can't, I can't take it.  Someone's got this, but no, that's not the picture of the van.  No, if you, if you took a digital picture of Spaz, you know, crashing the van or the damage  of the van, just give us a link to it on the instant feedback.  This guy says link for picture of van at Sticker Stop, and I click on the link, and it's just  a wow logo.  What, what is that?  Psycho Mark.  Dude, we're going to the atom bomb.  Roll out the Enola game. 
[02:14:00]  Are you kidding?  I swear to God, someone just came with a beautiful, uh, let's put it, uh, a beautiful sign.  With the A-bomb?  With the A-bomb on it.  They, they figured out what the A-bomb was?  I think we're going to do the A-bomb.  We have to.  Just stay away from Channel 2.  Stay away from Channel 2.  Ladies and gentlemen, as we look at the tarmac, smoke bellowing from the engines of the mighty  bomber, the B-29, Enola Gay, rolling out onto the tarmac.  Let it give it to the helm, a deadly cargo in a belly. 
[02:14:30]  Psycho Mark, you've got to stay away from Channel 2.  I will, it's tough.  I mean, they're all close together.  No, no, no, no, no, no, listen.  No, it's the atom bomb, dude.  It's the atom bomb.  You've got to stay away from Channel 2.  It, it, it lands on Channel 2.  All our jobs are done.  Oh, my God.  The atom bomb, dude.  The atom bomb.  I love the atom bomb.  The atom bomb.  Someone just walked up with an atom bomb sign.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  Wait, let's rethink this.  This can only be used.  Wait a minute.  This must be used wisely. 
[02:15:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Do you understand what the atom bomb's all about, Psycho Mark?  Uh, yes.  If you hit the wrong person, we're all done.  Well, hey, that's the whole thing.  No, no, no, no.  You need to understand.  You have to stay away from Channel 2.  I will.  And talk to the Psycho Mark.  Yes, just Channel 4 and Channel 7.  Either one can receive the atom bomb.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe the atom bomb and such short notice.  Now she is rolling out. 
[02:15:30]  Gaining altitude as she lifts up.  Oh, my God.  You're not even giving people a chance to prepare for the atom bomb.  Oh, my God.  This is like a quick strike, a lightning strike with the A-bomb.  All right, hold on a second, Mark.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  The A-bomb.  No, man.  Oh, dude.  Joey.  The A-bomb.  Joey.  Guys, man.  Yeah.  Guys, I got my VCRs going. 
[02:16:00]  I can't wait.  No.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Do you know how dangerous the atomic bomb is?  No, no, no.  I don't even know what it is, man, but I know it's going to be good.  If it strikes the wrong station, we're done.  We're done.  I'm taping four, five, and seven.  All right.  Yeah.  Stay away from two.  I love you.  All right.  Wait.  We've got to get back to Psycho, Mark.  Psycho, Mark.  Yeah, they're running.  Actually, I got two guys helping me with the wild sign.  They're out in front of the cameras right now, jumping up and down with all the people  screaming, we are Apple Tours. 
[02:16:30]  We are Apple Tours.  Oh.  So I got some cadets here, you know?  Well, oh, my God.  I don't know when they're going live, though.  It looks like they're still setting up.  Probably six.  Yeah, at this point, they're going live at six.  I can't.  I'm going to naturally hold this weapon back until the last possible moment.  Yeah, do not arm the bomb until you're ready to use it, if you understand what I mean.  All right, hold on.  You know, we're putting our careers in this stupid...  This idiot stands, Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  Mark.  What's that?  Mark, if this screws up and the wrong person gets hit with the A-bomb, we are all going to  have to bite our cyanide tablets.  Well, that's the risk.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Let's get rid of the risk.  It's very easy.  You stay away from Channel 2.  We're fine.  This can be no, you know, French Embassy accidental bombing.  I think they might be going live.  Channel 4.  No, they got Len Berman talking about the stupid Knicks.  All we need to know about the Knicks, keep Patrick Ewing out of the lineup. 
[02:17:30]  We win tonight.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  The atom bomb, Opie.  The atom bomb.  Dude, I'm shaking.  I get to shake.  Not the atom bomb.  My finger is on the trigger right now.  Mark, do you see where Channel 2 is?  I'm right next to the Channel 2 van.  That way, I'm not going to screw up.  All right.  Do not screw up.  Yeah, I won't.  Oh, my God.  We're all freaky because we know what you're about.  The implications of the A-bomb.  You know, and it has like radiation because it will go on for quite a while. 
[02:18:00]  The repercussions of this weapon are just the A-bomb.  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  Nothing.  This guy's trying to arrest me.  Yeah, sure.  I'm like, okay, terrific.  Yeah, right.  Hey, you know, the girl from News Channel 4, I'm like right next to the side of the van.  She's wearing a short skirt.  I can almost see cash.  This is the guy that we've trusted with the atomic bomb. 
[02:18:30]  That's a bad move, guys.  I just want to tell you.  Oh, my God.  Just leave it unarmed until it is ready to be used.  I will.  I will.  The new Hiroshima 48 canates.  Psycho Mark, you haven't smoked any pot yet today, right?  I'm on a drop.  You understand that you have to stay away from Channel 2, right?  I'm staying away, away from Channel 4, right?  No, no, Channel 2.  Oh, my God.  If you lay the A-bomb on a CBS property, dude, it's over. 
[02:19:00]  Do you understand?  People are beeping at the go bomb.  Hey, guys, go to Channel 4 because they're about to go.  All right.  Go on Channel 4.  I'm going to see if I can do a pre-atom bomb.  I don't think you'll have a chance to use the A-bomb if you go in with conventional weapons.  So go right in with the atomic bomb if you get the opportunity.  We are giving the authority.  Turn your key, sir.  Turn your key.  You've got to be over here, all right?  No conventional weapons will be used. 
[02:19:30]  A tactical nuke.  I love it.  Oh, no, this could get so ugly.  The A-bomb, Opie.  You know what the implications are?  We've got to call the plane back, I'm telling you.  We've got to call the plane back.  It's almost at fail-save.  We are almost at the fail-save where it cannot be called back.  Okay, there are the anchors at the desk.  Are they setting up for the live shot?  I think they're setting up.  There's a new Channel 4 lady on top of the truck right now. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Is there any way to reach her?  Is she in range?  She's kind of in range.  We'll try.  But you guys have to cue me as to which camera's on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the atomic bomb.  It's going crazy.  It just goes to show you how quickly these things happen.  How we go to a nuclear war so quickly.  If you're just tuning in, Psycho Mark is pulling out the atom bomb for live TV today.  Somebody has delivered the atomic bomb to Psycho Mark. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, if this thing goes off in my hands, I'm running like a mother.  Taking off from the island of Tinian.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I'm shaking.  I'm really shaking.  Don't say what the atomic bomb is just in case it doesn't work today.  Yeah, please.  No way.  Uh-uh, it's a super secret.  Are you kidding me?  But a listener called on and figured out what the atomic bomb was, huh?  Oh, really?  What a genius.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Well, it looks like Channel 4 is just about to go live.  Oh, my God.  I think.  And the rest of them, they've got all the cameras set up.  I am standing right next to all these crazy people.  Oh, my God.  I am like, it looks like I'm part of the New York Apple tours.  All right, listen.  Good.  Stay away from Channel 2.  Yeah.  Do you want to buy a ticket for the tour?  Do I want to buy a ticket for the tour?  Oh, you guys are still doing the tour?  Can I whip out my top when I'm on the bus?  I didn't like that comment. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Hey, there's a guy in line four that'll fix the van for one dollar.  Hey, tell me if Channel 4 is up.  It looks like she's bobbing her head up and down.  Yeah, it's got to be really soon.  They're in spots right now.  Yeah, they're in commercials.  I don't think we're going anywhere.  Oh, my God.  Not the A-con.  Guys, get ready for Channel 4 over here.  We're about to go green.  Oh, my God.  I think we can get that thing up high.  No, right here is just about good. 
[02:22:00]  Psycho Mark, they understand they can't do it to Channel 2, right?  Right.  We're not doing it to Channel 2.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here's my pina cola.  All right, hold on, because we're in commercials.  Hold on.  I've got to talk to somebody.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Hey.  I'm broadcasting it live throughout my neighborhood.  I've got all the stereos in my house cranked up.  Everybody in the neighborhood hears it, even if they haven't got the station tuned in.  The dropping of the atomic bomb. 
[02:22:30]  That's right.  I'm going to keep going throughout the end.  Well, you know something, we don't know if the target will be, we do not know.  Oh, okay, wait a minute, we have to go.  We've got to go to Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Okay, we think they might be going live.  Stand by.  They did the promo.  For what?  Is it?  Okay.  All right, all right.  It's at 6 o'clock.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to go back to that neighborhood.  Where's the neighborhood guy?  Did he hang up?  Maybe.  Oh, all right. 
[02:23:00]  Do you have an announcement for that neighborhood?  Yes, I'm not sure.  We won't know until they are actually over the target at the proper time if the target is indeed visible.  Or if it's obstructed and we can't drop the bomb.  But if the bomb is dropped, you can expect a blast.  That'll be heard all over the country.  All over, yeah.  All over the country.  It will just be huge.  We're not talking about a cute little A-bomb for New York.  This will be talked about all over the country, okay? 
[02:23:30]  There is a reason, yes.  We've been holding back the A-bomb for many months now, Anthony.  Today seems to be the day to pull it out.  All right.  Psycho Mark.  Yes.  All right.  What's the deal?  Is the target clear?  The target is actually looking beautiful right now.  Clear skies.  The pressure is good.  We've got good windage.  And we're ready.  We've actually opened up the bus.  Okay. 
[02:24:00]  They've just gone to the anchors at the desk.  We are looking.  They promo.  All right.  They're going to for your health.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe we are here in the war room.  Yeah.  Legally awaiting.  Eric, real fast.  What's going on?  If you guys don't drop this A-bomb today, I am never going to listen to you guys again.  You can't wimp out.  It's up to Psycho Mark and the psychopaths out there today.  It has to be the perfect moment.  You guys have to do it.  All right, man. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm so nervous.  Dave, what's going on?  Pressure's cost.  You've got to drop the A-bomb.  We're going to drop it, but we just don't want it on Channel 2.  That's the only thing I'm worried about.  This is going to be the biggest event in the history of the world.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  If I see this, I am going to ask myself, I swear to you.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, I want to know what the A-bomb is.  You've got to tell me.  No, we can't.  We can't. 
[02:25:00]  It's so dangerous, it can't even be discussed.  You've got to give me something.  It may be happening on Channel 4 very soon.  Yeah.  That's all I'm going to say.  You're just going to have to look.  Shield your eyes from the blast.  Shield your eyes.  Hey, we've got to confess it.  Do you want to wow the camera?  You can't?  No, we've got to be afraid of watching.  We've got to be afraid of families watching.  I also watch for that.  All right.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  They're running a report on pregnant chicks exercising.  Oh, great.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they've got a little press conference set up right outside here, and they've got a 
[02:25:30]  bunch of the workers holding up signs and stuff like that, goofy stuff.  And the only one on top of the truck right now is my friend over here at News Channel 4.  Yeah.  And they're up there right now, and it looks like she's ready to go live any minute.  Yeah, yeah.  They're pretty much setting up for a 6 o'clock shot.  All right.  I'm going to try and jump on top of this guy's shoulders and jump up and see if I can get  this thing up even higher.  With the A-bomb.  All right, Mark. 
[02:26:00]  With the A-bomb.  Oh, my God, no.  Hold on one second.  We've got to talk to Military Mike.  Military Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  I'm stuck at work.  This thing better be big enough to be covered by the 10 and 11 o'clock news.  Because I want to see what's going to happen.  If they pull this off, it'll be all over the country.  Thank you.  This is the occasion when the A-bomb blows.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I think we can go to Anthony real fast.  Anthony.  The bridges and the tunnels are clogged.  There's 45-minute delays right now.  Really?  I swear to God. 
[02:26:30]  You drop this A-bomb, we're not going to be able to get out of the city.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  You're freaking idiot.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  All right.  We're back to you.  All right.  It looks like they're about to go live.  Excuse me, witch.  What happened?  Some people are trying to walk down the street, pushing me out of the way.  Oh, all right.  I don't understand.  I have a job to do here.  Okay.  This is dangerous.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Martian.  I'm thinking Martian. 
[02:27:00]  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  Okay.  I'm just sitting here patiently.  You guys got the 24-hour?  Oh, yes, we do.  They're introing all the reporters now.  They're at the beginning of the show.  All right.  Something about them.  I don't know.  They're doing their stories.  Does she look like she's going to go?  Oh, we have a contestant.  There it is.  Tour is suspended.  They're promoing it right now.  Dude, just get the girl doing the boobs.  You want to wow the camera? 
[02:27:30]  Come on.  You can't.  I don't know.  How much money do we have to give away?  Okay.  Okay.  They're going.  All tours suspended.  Here they go.  Where's Mark?  Where's psycho Mark?  Mark.  All right.  Are they on here?  There she is.  She's live.  She's live.  Where's the A-bomb?  I'm trying to get it.  Get up there.  Boobs.  Boobs.  Boobs.  Boobs.  You can't get up high enough.  I can't.  Oh, they're on a tight shot. 
[02:28:00]  There's the A-bomb.  There's a little bit to the right.  There's the A-bomb.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did I get it?  Oh, my God.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God.  No, they're moving the cameras.  You can't come on in.  Hold on.  Go talk to Psychobark.  Oh, my God.  We have confirmation. 
[02:29:00]  Scott from Eaton Town.  We are confirming a mushroom cloud.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  I'm freaking out.  That was one of our listeners.  A sick bastard.  Here we go.  Catrice Jack from Jersey.  The A-bomb on live TV.  Yes.  Everyone checking in with confirmation, Opie.  Holy smoke.  Did you see that? 
[02:29:30]  Plain as day.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Adam, what's going on?  Un-F-ing believable.  Don't say what it was.  Don't say what it was.  Oh, no, I won't.  All right, Adam.  Wow.  I'm blown away.  I wish I had something cool to say, but I'm blown away.  You know why it was called the A-bomb? 
[02:30:00]  No.  That had to be.  Matt, what's going on?  Matt.  Yeah.  Matt, what's up?  Oh, I just wanted to say that I was, like, hysterical.  I'm blown away by that one.  You guys are going to burn the hell for that.  I'm going to send it to every one of my friends.  All right, Matt.  You're on my side.  All right.  I cannot believe I saw what I just saw on live TV.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:30]  Never before in the history of TV.  Oh, let me catch my breath here.  Oh, they didn't go back to her.  Oh, my God.  This means war.  The A-bomb has been dropped.  People calling it the greatest thing ever.  Alex.  Oh, my God.  I almost jumped out the window.  Oh, my God.  I saw it.  I saw the last two letters.  I'm like, oh, what the hell are you guys doing? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my.  I'm speechless.  I'm just speechless.  Yeah.  It's the greatest thing ever.  I'll see you.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Syndication never, Opie.  Ow.  What's the indication ever?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I was skating home listening to you guys about this A-bomb, and on my way home,  I busted my ass just getting home.  And it was totally worth it.  It was so worth it.  But you guys are going to burn, man.  She was so cute.  How could you do that?  Well, thank you.  A lot of instant feedbacks. 
[02:31:30]  That was the funniest S I've ever seen.  I just had a heart attack.  Someone's saying, Psycho Mark.  Dude, the camera, the reporter is giving me the nastiest face I've ever seen in my life.  She is so mad that I do.  Well, Psycho Mark, when you drop the bomb, you must pull out in a climbing turn to avoid  the backlash.  The backblast is fine right now.  They've got guys running in front of all the TV reporters again.  They're in front of Telemundo right now as we speak.  Mark, yeah, Mark, pull out a high climb and get out of there.  Get out of there now. 
[02:32:00]  You're going to hit, yeah, go, go.  We're getting reports.  We're getting reports.  The backblast is going to hit your wings.  You're going to be a prisoner of war.  Get the hell out of there.  Get the hell out of there.  We've got to fly, guys.  There you go.  Get out now.  It's coming down.  It's coming down.  We're getting out of here.  There we go.  It keeps on.  There you go.  Psycho Mark pulling away from the flash.  The blast as it bounces off of the ground zero and back towards the aircraft.  Psycho Mark must pull out of there to avoid any repercussions. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, my God.  Harry S. Truman checking in that this will go down in infamy.  There were no survivors.  Oh, my God.  Steve, unbelievable.  They didn't even go back for her wrap-up.  George.  Yes.  Hey.  How many casualties were there?  There were no survivors.  No survivors.  I didn't think of four-letter work.  It caused much damage. 
[02:33:00]  The A-bomb has been dropped.  Amazing.  Amazing.  I killed myself coming up to get the VCR rolling.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Channel 4 has been nuked.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Oh, man.  I can't believe it.  See you next Tuesday?  I don't know what that means.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, Channel 4 is in flames.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[02:33:30]  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Oh, man.  That was...  Let me tell you something, man.  That was amazing.  I'm at work, and I turn you guys back on, and all of a sudden I'm hearing the A-bomb stuff  and Channel 4.  I'm like, let me turn on the TV and see what's going on.  And all of a sudden, I'm just hanging out, and I saw it.  Yeah.  I was like, yo, man.  That was amazing.  That was amazing.  They're going to be pissed.  Oh, my God.  They're going to be pissed, man.  All right, man.  You guys rule, man.  Keep it up.  All right, Steve.  Later.  Also, just remember that with Hiroshima, there was indeed a Nagasaki a few days later, and 
[02:34:00]  it pretty much ended the war.  Scott, what's going on?  As a radio talk and a former TV guy, I'd just like to say, God love you.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  We're getting reports in high-order detonation of weapon.  The target completely enveloped in smoke and debris.  Colonel Tibbetts, mission accomplished.  You're cleared to return to base. 
[02:34:30]  Jason.  Yeah.  Hey.  That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen on television.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Oh.  I got to say, we were going for live boobs when one of the listeners came by with the  A-bomb.  Dude, I work around there every day.  Yeah.  I swear.  I have to find out when they're going to go live again.  I'll do it myself.  All right.  Oh, man.  Great, guys.  Thank you.  Communication underwear.  All right.  Bye.  Who thought today would be the day where we pulled out the big one?  Let's go to Tom. 
[02:35:00]  Tom, what's up?  Yo, guys.  I'm out here in Patchogue.  I see this little hand creep up in the air, and there it is, right over her shoulder.  It was awesome.  Was that sick, man?  It was sick.  When did you ever see that on TV?  You don't even see that on NYPD Blue.  Oh, you can see it everywhere.  All right, Tom.  Awesome.  Bye.  God, that's got to be a first.  Can we do a first?  Can that be a first?  That is definitely a first.  God damn it. 
[02:35:30]  Say what you want, but that has never been done before.  All right, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  We are definitely going to have to reside in the Fallout Celtics for a while after this one.  Peter.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I watched the A-bomb live on TV.  I got it on tape.  It is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  It was on there for a while, and it was plain as day, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got to see a replay of that.  Oh, I got it. 
[02:36:00]  I'm watching it now.  I keep rewinding it.  I can't believe it.  I see Psycho Mark's arm come up.  I don't even know if it was him.  It was one of the listeners.  One of the listeners?  Yeah, we were trying to get the boobs on TV.  Yeah, I know.  I was watching all the stations.  There it is.  There it is.  There he is.  I hear him.  Oh, and A.  You hear him screaming in the background.  There it is, right above his shoulder.  You got to see it with the sound.  All right.  Thank you, Peter.  All right, man.  Bye.  All right.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:30]  Sean, what's going on?  We put the C in NBC.  All right.  This is a roving reporter out here on Long Island, and the seismic earthquakes are still  being felt from the atomic bomb.  I'm sure.  I was in New York City earlier today.  That was amazing, guys.  That was just amazing.  Wait until someone tells that poor girl news reporter what was behind her when she was doing  her little alarm.  She had no clue.  No, she didn't.  She didn't even know.  That was great, guys.  All right.  Good luck, man.  Bye.  Well, wow.  All right.  The phones, the feedback, everything just going absolutely nuts.  All you can imagine are the people watching that program who were not listening to this 
[02:37:00]  program.  Right.  Imagine just them sitting watching the music going, what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, my dear Lord.  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  Hey, John.  John.  Yo, fellas.  That one even took out the cockroaches, man.  Oh, there is nothing left. 
[02:37:30]  That was great.  Hey, is that Chris Russo's wife?  That was that Melissa Russo.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  Oops.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, it's in the case when Spaz learned how to drive.  Cool.  Thanks, John.  Just reports coming in like crazy.  Mike from Bayside.  Oh, my God.  Funniest goddamn thing in the history of TV.  Yeah.  The history of TV now, Anthony.  Let's see.  I think you guys, the fallout can be felt down everywhere.  I think Channel 7 got the word because Bill Butel did the Big Apple story with no live  coverage. 
[02:38:00]  Channel 7 did not go live.  Brian from Jersey.  I'm twitching.  I can't breathe.  I feel all tingly.  I think the radiation is reaching New Jersey.  Oh, man.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I'm driving here in my car.  I'm chomping at the bit because I didn't know what you guys were going to do.  Yeah.  I called my buddy, Todd.  He's sitting at home.  I haven't switched to Channel 4.  He doesn't listen to you guys. 
[02:38:30]  He checks it out.  He was in stitches.  I think he gained a new listener.  He was in absolute stitches.  He said it was unmistakable.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Yeah, the funny part was the clarity of the whole thing.  It was not just a simple flash that you had to really catch.  It was right there.  Plain as day.  All right.  And we definitely have to take a break.  Yes, we do.  And we'll be back.  Gentlemen, start your wacky.

Yeah, you know, I want to know when the loyal listeners are going to find out what the A-bomb is. 
[02:41:30]  I didn't stop and get gassed to rush home, and now I'm sitting, I'm going to run out of gas.  All right, without saying anything.  Give us a hint.  Come on.  Well, don't you say anything either like that you know what it is, but NBC is truly must-see TV.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There are a lot of hints.  I think a lot of people have figured it out.  There's a bunch of hints about it.  You got something up on the website?  Huh?  You got something up on the website?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  Well, I think that's one and done.  Come on.  You might need the Defense Department to keep this confidential.  That's what we just need to know.  All right, Bob.  We want to know.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Go to Jackie.  Jackie, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, I was just wondering.  Did you guys hear it?  What?  Did you hear them screaming your names while they were doing it?  No.  Oh, my God.  I was listening to my Walkman while watching TV.  My mother thinks I'm out of my mind.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Too funny.  Well, yeah, we didn't have the TV audio on in the station. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  My mother was like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Crazy.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jackie.  Let's go to Darren.  Darren, what's going on?  Hello.  How are you, Darren?  Hey, guys.  That's what it must have been like to see the moon landing.  Or the Beatles invasion.  Right.  I missed all that good stuff, man.  I got to see that.  That was great.  That is definitely a first.  Everyone's going to know where they were when the A-bomb hit.  Oh, yeah, like Kennedy and everything, man.  All right.  That's great, guys. 
[02:43:00]  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Oh.  I bet we're in big trouble.  Hey, I don't know.  We didn't do anything.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  I was on the Tappan Z.  I was trying to get home to see it.  And this guy had a van with one of those TVs in it.  Yeah.  And he was screaming out the window, dude, put on Channel 4.  I was chasing him.  He wouldn't open his window.  I wanted to look and see.  I still haven't gotten to figure out what this thing is.  You'll know soon enough.

That was the funniest S I ever saw.  My wife saw it with me holding our two-month-old baby and almost dropped her.  People almost dropped babies over the day, Bob.  Oh.  Dave.  You.  How are you, Dave?  What's up, fellas?  What's going on?  Dude, I live in a building, right?  I live on the ninth floor. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Got the window open, got the TV on, got you guys on the radio.  Yeah.  I was screaming so loud, laughing my head off.  I swear to God, I'm going to get evicted now because I was so loud.  It was incredible, fellas.  All right.  Well, that was something.  Hey, F Jackie, F Blaze.  All right.  Bye.  Thanks.  Wow.  Hey, Keith.  Hey.  Hey.  The phone's just going nuts.  I know.  What's up?  I still have a mushroom cloud over Westchester County.  Yeah.  Do you think I was a wood floor?  Thank you, Keith.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  There's the famous sign right there.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Oh, dude.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Nice wow sign.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened to the live boobs on TV, Psycho Mark?  I got sidestepped.  Now, you made it back with no problems?  All right.  Beautiful walk right down here.  Nice.  See, no one was upset.  All right.  This guy was at the front lines. 
[02:45:30]  George.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, it's the Greek guy again.  Listen, I was on 48.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, hey.  We don't need that on our program.  No.  All right, man.  It was effing unbelievable.  Yeah.  So, Private George reporting in.  Thank you, George.  I love the smell of Russo in the morning.  All right.  Over and out.  All right.  Yeah.  People want to buy copies of the tape, Anthony.  Kevin.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I'm dying. 
[02:46:00]  I'm driving just across the 59 Street Bridge.  What a freaking copy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to be a very popular video cassette.  You've got to get it out there.  I almost died.  People are watching me driving in my car, and I'm laughing hysterically.  This couple thought I was freaking busting a nut.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That was never before seen on TV.  No.  I can honestly say I've watched a lot of television in my day, and I have never, ever seen that 
[02:46:30]  on television.  Besides, you know.  You've got to get it out there.  HBO, maybe.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Another first.  Yeah.  For you and I.  Could be a last.  Usually when we have first, it's a last.  That's not good.  We've got to calm down.  Oh, I know. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, well.  Well, maybe no one will say anything.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's going on?  How are you?  All right.  I had to get out of Jersey.  I had to get into Jersey right after the sign was over.  My head was falling out and crumps.  Were you the one holding the sign?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was me.  All right.  Good.  He's a crumb.  He doesn't give up.  They had him scoped out from the minute he got there.  And you guys decided to bring the A-bomb down there, huh? 
[02:47:30]  Hey.  Guy needs help.  Got to do it.  Joe's willing to admit that he brought the A-bomb down in the live shot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't work for the station.  What do I get?  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  No problem, guys.  We might need this tape in court.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Opie, I was under the impression the A-bomb was something else.  When I saw it on TV, I was completely shocked.  I was hoping for live boobs. 
[02:48:00]  Well, yeah.  I was hoping.  Oh, well.  All right.  Channel 7 barely did the story on the buses after the A-bomb.  That was awesome.  Bryant and Seaford.  Yeah.  We love it.  Hey, John.  John, what's up?  I just want to say, yo, guys, see you next Tuesday now.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Bye.  Don't know what that means, Anthony. 
[02:48:30]  John checking in.  Oh, Tom.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I need you to do me a favor.  What?  My wife is listening.  We were eating dinner, and I ran downstairs to see what it was, and I yelled it.  And she was yelling at me because I left the table.  And she thought I, you know, said that to her.  So, I know she's listening to you guys now.  You got to tell her.

Bye.  Charlie.  Yo.  Hey.  What's going on, boys?  Talking to you.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I got to ask you a question.  Yeah.  I'm an offended listener.  I had a lie to get on the air.  Don't hang up.  I need to know what it is.  I'm on the L.A.E.  Good luck, and I'm pissed off.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll have someone tell you.  Well, Dean.  Tell them on line one.

Well, I don't know, Dean.  This has nothing to do with the topic, I guess, but no.  We did not see Mr. Hunt.

[02:51:30]  Steven Lynch.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you  Kill a Kitten.  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you  Kill a Kitten.  There's no crime that you'll be committing. 
[02:52:00]  I know the law, you can't kill a Kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you tell I can't tell. 
[02:52:30]  Eat a turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoes, as long as you kill a Kitten.  I said torture a Kitten.  I said kill it. 
[02:53:00]  I said I can't.  Alright, listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a Kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, cause that's where it's written.  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a Kitten. 
[02:53:30]  Slush it down the can, hit it with your van.  Drown it in a lane, bake a kiwi cake.  Throw him at a train, make him snipe cocaine.  Stick some TNT up its caputin'. 
[02:54:00]  Do what you must do, as long as you can't kill a Kitten.  Do what you must do, as long as you can't kill a Kitten.  Do what you must do, as long as you can't kill a Kitten.  Do what you must do, as long as you can't kill a Kitten.  Killing Kittenz isn't easy.  And If the thought makes you feel queasy. 
[02:54:30]  Grab a pitchfork from the scent.  What do you do?  You can't find me  Dog and stay  Yeah  Get a kitten  Get a kitten  Get a kitten  A little furry kitten  Get a kitten  Get a kitten  Get a little mother  Get a kitten  Get a little  Get a kitten

You see that in the movies, I'll be  They send the bombers out  To bomb a target  And then past a certain point  Even the government that sent the planes out  Cannot call the planes back  Because it's called a fail safe mark  It's a defense against the enemy radioing the planes  And saying, you know, turn back, turn back  Right, I understand  So even if they want to call them back, they can't  This is good  Matt from Westchester in Bill's dead voice
