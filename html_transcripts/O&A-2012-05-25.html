<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony's hilarious yet disturbing saga involving his West Highland Terrier's bowel issues and his subsequent misuse of a PetSmart shock collar.  He detailed his attempts to control the dog's stool consistency through diet, followed by a confession of shocking both himself and his dog, expressing regret at the dog's reaction.  This led to a bizarre in-studio experiment where Jimmy, Patrice, Steve, and eventually a guest named "Virus" were subjected to varying levels (1-10) of the shock collar's power, their reactions providing ample comedic fodder. Virus, strapped to the collar, was given 30 seconds to tell jokes on various increasingly challenging topics (Carrie Prejean's sex tapes, Bert and Ernie's sexuality, Michael Jackson's movie), with failure resulting in a shock— ultimately reaching a level 8 shock before removing the collar.

The show then featured comedian Ken Jeong as a guest.  The conversation covered Jeong's career (stand-up, *Knocked Up*, *Pineapple Express*, *Step Brothers*, *The Office*, a wrestling appearance), punctuated by explicit and comedic exchanges with the hosts.  A caller, Fred, complained about cuts to *The Hangover*'s airplane version, specifically mentioning a CGI'd "elevator blowjob" and a "muddy" Kim Jong-il-like character.  A substantial portion focused on ghosts and haunted places, with listener calls sharing paranormal anecdotes and Jeong sharing his Amityville Horror House experience.  A funeral director, Joe, then called in with graphic details about his work, including embalming procedures and handling bodily fluids, providing further morbid humor.

Ice-T and Coco joined the show next. Ice-T discussed his new book, *ISIS Road from South Central to Hollywood*, reflecting on his career, including his controversial music and the president's anger towards him.  The conversation touched on the evolution of rap, his acting career (*Law & Order*), and the music industry's shift away from physical media. Coco’s Twitter controversy, specifically a removed photo of her balancing a can on her buttocks, led to a discussion about censorship and her social media persona ("Thong Thursdays," "Titty Tuesdays").  They further detailed their relationship and "sexual code," including roleplay and fantasies.  The latter half of the segment showcased a video of a DelDOT crew removing a basketball hoop, sparking anger at perceived abuse of power and excessive bureaucracy, with the hosts and guests using highly offensive language.

A segment featuring a video of a homeowner's confrontation with Delaware state troopers over the basketball hoop removal followed. This spurred a discussion about the erosion of personal freedoms and unreasonable local authorities, followed by the hosts' own embarrassing junior high and high school romance stories.  A call from Dr. Steve was cut short.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a leaked video of a staged argument between Nick DiPaolo and Louis C.K., with Louis C.K. calling in to explain it was a scripted scene leaked by an extra, Robert E. Taylor. The hosts discussed the extra's actions using vulgar language.

The final segment began with the hosts discussing a young person's inappropriate actions on a film set, highlighting generational differences in work ethics.  This transitioned into a discussion of Louis C.K.'s comedy and a staged fight scene with Nick DiPaolo.  A call with Dr. Steve followed, detailing his inappropriate but humorous best man speech at a non-alcoholic wedding and anecdotes about his work in hospice care, death, and a possible ghostly encounter.  The show concluded with a call from Dr. Michio Kaku, discussing the dangers of a wildfire approaching a plutonium waste dump in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the potential hazards of plutonium exposure.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and topics were prevalent.  The show featured in-studio guests Ken Jeong, Ice-T, Coco, Jimmy Norton, and Patrice, while Dr. Steve, Dr. Michio Kaku, Joe (the funeral director), Louis C.K., and several callers participated via phone.

[00:34:00]  like the outfit  we never talked  we never talked  about the show  it was always  fucking baggy clothes  and treats  look what I got  from the store  it was fucking  truffles  wait wait  you gotta tell  the best story  I always make you tell it  when we  the candy place  Kenny  where were we  Detroit  yeah  and this guy  who was a fan  had one of those  candy places  with the barrels  and you know  the big boxes  you know  like a special  candy bag thing  and you go to town  yeah but  he'll tell you  so the guy 
[00:34:30]  cause he's a fan  he goes  hey you want some candy  as soon as somebody  says that  you realize  that this is gonna be  the end of the  fucking business  I'm a fan  ka-ching  ka-ching  yeah  what was driving  you crazy  I was embarrassed  because it was like  I want to take  a couple of things  give me a few  a quarter pound  of candy  but he's fucking  running around  and that's where  double bag it  comes from  he's like  happy  double bag it  and he's fucking  shamelessly filling  bag after bag  and me and Rob  with Kenny 
[00:35:00]  with the scooper  me and Rob  are standing  across the store  embarrassed  and all you hear  is the scooper  going  it was fucking  I was so embarrassed  was the fan  in the corner  crying  no  then Kenny  this is the beauty  of it  cause he's tall  they had like  big boxes  like the $60 boxes  of chocolate  on top  I'm like  Kenny  grab one of those  up there  yeah  for the kids  for the kids 
[00:35:30]  so now  yes  you clean the  motherfucker out  no it was  it was really heavy  the bags  that was the beauty  of it  holy shit  so now we walk  out of this place  and right next  to the candy place  was a cologne place  and all  you know  the guy wanted  a couple tickets  so I go  you know  can we get like  you know  some cologne  by now  the guy's like  a little shell shocked  but he's going  yeah I guess so  and then it starts  oh let me try  this one  let me try that  throw that in a bag 
[00:36:00]  yeah  throw that in a bag  I think it was like  $1500 in cologne  that he had to call  his father  and go look  they're giving me  a couple  oh Jesus  for two $35 tickets  the guy gave away  fucking  he gave away  $1500  for the fucking cologne  I forgot about that  he had to call the father  it was horrifying  how embarrassing  it was so fucking  mortifying  oh I was so happy  about that  because normally  you take a couple of things  oh or I'll have a small bottle  yeah yeah  he had to call his father 
[00:36:30]  to go look  holy shit  can we give this much away  for free  I mean we were all  walking with giant  like shopping bag  size of candy  you brought the guy  and cologne  yeah but I love to steal  oh that's fantastic  but it's so much better  Dice loves a good steal  he steals legally  yeah yeah  Dice loves making a steal  he knows how to do the stealing legally  oh he steals illegally too  you should walk into a sweatshirt store  with him  and he'd fucking be hiding  behind the thing  putting on stolen shirts  and putting a giant sweatshirt 
[00:37:00]  on  and we're going to fucking jail  you know what I used to do with Kenny  I'd walk into a store right  yeah  I'd walk into a store  and you know  find like a sweatshirt I like  and I  just without paying for it  and I go  you got a scissor  you know  you come up to the counter  and they go  oh yeah  and then I just start  cutting the sleeves  off the  the $60 shirt  that's not paid for yet  you know  and I would just  want the sleeve  to use like  as a giant headband  at that time  oh the fuck  and they go  oh I'll tell you 
[00:37:30]  great one  out in fucking Vegas  okay  so  I come in  I want to buy like  some TVs  at this electronics store  oh shit  oh this is the fucking best  some TVs  who buys some TVs  no so I get the guy  in the corner  the salesman  right  and I'm going  alright look at me  I gotta talk to you  you're gonna give me  a good deal  on this stuff right  I go  why don't  just  just for starters  knowing I'm gonna get  some big TVs  try one in 19 inch  like without even 
[00:38:00]  making the deal  you're already  trying  it's a pretty  19 inch  so the guy  does it  right  so then on top  of it  you know  he's gotta give me  like rock bottom  prices on the big TVs  cause I bought  like three of them  I'm going  what are you  the 19 inch TV  it's like $300  what's it  you know  that's nothing  so now I'm with  this comic  you know  Steve Simone  yeah yeah  okay  so I'm with  Steve Simone  and at that time  Steve's like 26  you know  so as we're getting  ready to leave 
[00:38:30]  I go  I promised the kid  a Walkman  you know  can you just  you know  give him a Walkman  you got those  shockwaves over there  give him a Walkman  what's the big deal  so they give him  the Walkman  right  like he's a child  I promised the kid  a Walkman  yeah  so  and this is after  we robbed  the Macy's Home Store  for thousands  and sheets  because  I got sick  of returning stuff  so I just  walked in there  with a giant  fucking bag 
[00:39:00]  and just said  just fucking  load it up  every size sheet  you know  and on the way out  I returned something  so they had to  give me 400 bucks  on top of it  and Steve's looking  going  you're gonna walk out  I go  what the fuck  I've been here  four times  they should be  giving me stuff  this is stuff  you need  to put on the bed  I bought the bed  from them  they should come  with it  so now we're  in the electronics  store  and he gets  the Walkman  and on the way  out I see  this great  metal CD rack 
[00:39:30]  so I just  clip it  I just pick it up  and start heading  towards the store  and some salesman  goes  excuse me  excuse  and I gotta tell you  about another thing  he goes  excuse me  he goes  uh  uh  you know  you gotta pay for that  I go  no no no  it's handled  it's that guy  over there  and I just  walk out  with it  right  so now  the last time  I was there  ask that guy  over there  yeah  no  because I figure  what is it  it's a hundred  not a hundred dollars 
[00:40:00]  they probably  buy it for ten  you know  you give it away  you make the parts  and feel good  right  you know  so now  the last time  the last time  I'm there  uh  one of my kids  drums are broken  okay  so I go to Sam Ash  with this bass drum  and I just walk in  and I put it down  and I take another one  just like it  that's not cracked  and this guy goes  excuse me  and I go  yeah  can I help you  with something  I go  I gotta get out of here  we got a show today  can I help you 
[00:40:30]  with something  you know  and he goes  uh  what are you doing  with the drum  I go  can't you see  this one is broken  I go  my friend  Steve Arnold  it's handled  don't worry about it  you know  and he goes  oh okay  I didn't know  you know  and I leave  with the bass drum  now my friend  when it was  a different store  called Mars Music  used to manage  the store  he's got nothing  to do with Sam Ash  but for some reason  this guy was like  oh okay  you know  you know  what am I gonna pay 
[00:41:00]  for one drum  you pay for a set  I don't need  the whole set  what do I gotta negotiate  how much  exactly  yeah  he just traded  a bad one  for a new one  that's why I got nuts  when people went nuts  from gas prices  all kidding aside  like people would  stand in the  gasoline store  whatever it is  station  whatever  and they're going  oh do you believe  these prices  like when it was  like five  six dollars  I'm going  so what  I would tell  the attendant  charge me more  that's the best  you could do  because people  have the wrong 
[00:41:30]  mindset  see they start  going oh  I can't believe  how much gas  is  I go  yeah but  you need gas  to get to the mall  where you could  steal everything else  so if they want  to fuck young  who gives them  charge me thirty dollars  here's a hundred  tip  through the windows  who gives a fuck  because I'm going  to steal everything  I can get my  fucking hands on  when I get to the mall  you know what I mean  yeah  god damn  think about it  you know what I mean  I don't even have to  the logic comes  right through  exactly 
[00:42:00]  I don't have to  think about it  for a second  shoe stores are the easiest  when they go walk around  see how you feel  oh okay  and you're going to go  in the back  and get the next size  right  the biggest assholes  working shoe stores  and on the way out  they got all the  giveaway socks  you know  all that shit  that's why I wear the  pants with the big pockets  he just puts the  fucking shoes on  in one thousand  they're already used  what do you  give them back  yeah I could use  a little bigger  side  why don't you  check them back  with the laces  to take them off  just go  I leave the old ones 
[00:42:30]  it's not like I don't  give them something  they dice the sneakers  you can sell them  on iSpace  whatever  yeah where you sell  shit  right  right  do you remember  what Smirnoff  with the silver bracelet  and fucking Macy's  oh this is great  this fucking  fag cocksucker  let me tell you  this one  this is funny  not about fags  you know  it was just funny  this little fucking  fag right  I'm with this  comic  this real tall  skinny guy 
[00:43:00]  Bruce Smirnoff  and I just won  like 70,000  at Bally's Hotel  like in a minute  I won it  right  so we go to Macy's  and I pick out  this like little  silver bracelet  for like 300  right  so Bruce is  standing here  and Kenny's  over here  right  so I say  to the little  faggotron  behind the counter  I go  maybe you got  something I could  put this in  you know  you got like  a little case  so he turns around  and when he does that  I just take the  bracelet  and put it 
[00:43:30]  in my pocket  right  and Bruce is looking  now the guy knows  I just won like  70,000  so the guy turns back  and he's looking  at the counter  and he's going  where's the bracelet  I go  I don't know  where's the bracelet  I go  I want a case with it  I want a case with it  and now  the beauty of  all I wanted to do  was affect this guy  Bruce right  and he's looking  because he wants to say  you put it in your pocket  but he won't  because he's opening  for me right  and Kenny knows 
[00:44:00]  the goof right  so he's just standing  so the guy goes  no no  I left the bracelet here  when I look for the  you know  for the little  thing to put it in  I go  yes so what do you want  from me  I don't know where it is  I go  what do you think  I need to steal  a $300 fucking bracelet  and put them on  the defensive  and the guy's going  no I'm just saying  it was right here  I go  I don't know  what to tell you  you know  I go  but I'm not going  to be insulted  by somebody like you 
[00:44:30]  and I left  fucking stealing  everywhere you go  there's nothing  cologne  why ever pay for cologne  in this day and age  when the recession  you want to charge me  $90 for this bottle of shit  that I'm not even sure  if it gets from the spray  to my arm  right  so what do you do  you just go in  you got to confuse  the faggotito  behind the counter  right  you confuse him  and as he's going

[00:46:30]  but everyone is talking  about community  and what I've seen  I do love it  and I said yesterday  I gotta make some time  to DVR the show  and watch it  right right  it's really fucking good  and Chevy Chase  someone that  most of us want to hate  is good in this show  no he brings it man  it's just really cool  he definitely  he definitely  like you know  working with him  has been great  he brings his aid  prick to work with  though right  he's been fine with me  I'll be honest  you know  you hear about it  but it's just like  I don't know  he's just at a point 
[00:47:00]  in his life  I remember saying  something when I met  I was like  I'm just a huge fan  and he was like  you know what  I'm just old enough  to appreciate that  you know  that was really cool  he kind of got a reputation  over the years  of being a little difficult  yeah we've all heard it  but I find him great  his wife is like  I think  I think he was saying  we've been over to his house  and he had the cast  over to his house  before the show began  and he was really nice  to my wife  and my kids  had two baby girls  and like Janie  would go out her way  to make sure  my girls had stuff  to play with  white girl can  yeah they're two  yeah we adopted 
[00:47:30]  in reverse  no no no  you have an Asian wife  oh no no  I have an Asian wife  you really  congratulations  wait he's not  truly Hollywood  he didn't leave  his whole time  no I haven't  gone Hollywood yet  no no I haven't  did you really adopt  no no I didn't  I'm sorry  that would be  it's too competitive  to keep up  I was trying to keep up  that's all  hey what's the show about  because I heard it's good  and I've never seen it  community college  it's about community college  Joel McHale plays  he's a lawyer  who basically  found out that  the law board  found out that  he did not graduate 
[00:48:00]  from college  in the United States  so he gets disbarred  and now is forced  to complete his college degree  he goes to a community college  and that's where it starts  so the pilot started  from him  at the college  like pissed off  not in a good  you know  just kind of in a bad place  so then he meets  all these Motley Crue characters  and then I played  a Spanish teacher  upon which the pilot  was based on  who does  Anthony Michael Hall play  Anthony Michael Hall  is going to appear  I think in the  Christmas episode  where he plays  he's actually  oh he's not in the cast  yeah he has a guest star 
[00:48:30]  but he's great  he's wicked funny  I mean he's really funny  and he brings it  it's really funny  was that your penis  in Hangover?  yeah  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  what are you doing?  I'm sorry  it was a last minute  what are you doing?  I know  it was literally  a last second decision  and I just  it was  it was my idea  I pitched it to Todd Phillips  the director  and I said  would it be okay  if I do  I just felt like  I was supposed to come out  of the trunk  with my pants on  or my slacks on  and I said  I think it'd be funny  if I could try it naked 
[00:49:00]  and not thinking  but I was serious  about the idea  but I didn't think  he would bite  he would go for it  he was like  he literally said  you don't have to ask me twice  and he was just like  do it  and then we did it  and then he was just like  and he made me sign  like a nudity waiver  within like half an hour  but you have to sign  a nudity waiver  I had to sign  like a nudity clause  saying like  I agreed to be  fucking lawyers  it's now nudity waivers  yeah  I mean it's more important  for  don't give this place 
[00:49:30]  an idea  somebody must have sued though  somebody probably sued  right  what's that based on  for actresses  really primarily  for women  in film  you know  you don't want to  like you don't want to  be showing their  breasts or their cooch  like you know  on any  like you know  DVD  or you know  there's laws about that  or how to rebroadcast  nudity or something  so  for guys  you know  especially for comedy  nerd guys  guys  just show their dick  who cares  I didn't see that scene  I didn't see the movie  it's a good movie man 
[00:50:00]  it's a really good comedy  I didn't see the scene  I didn't see the movie  I didn't see the scene  I didn't see that scene  or the entire film  I didn't see the film  for the people  that haven't seen the film  Ken Jeong is packing  maybe an inch  yeah  really  yeah  that a boy  is it a grower  it's a grower  not a shower  that kind of thing  it gets up to some  kind of respectability  yeah  I got  the way I looked at it  then he had the big  hairy fucking bush  I had the merkin 
[00:50:30]  yeah  everyone thought it was fake  and it was just like  yeah  did you grow that  just for the scene  no I just didn't  I've never shaved  I've never done anything  you're a mess  you're a mess  yeah  it was just kind of  I'm a mess  I mean  like I figured  you know  I have two kids  I have nothing  I have nothing else to prove  so I figured  you don't understand  you shave it down  it's going to look  a little bigger  yeah  I had emails  after the movie came out  like many guys  have emailed me  that said  like if you shave it  you shave around the base  a little bit  shave around the base  you can see the push  for Ken man  you should not be  thinking that 
[00:51:00]  you will fucking have  but I know  you roll with the  like that crew  like you're in  all the fucking  funny white boy movies now  yep  and so you  you're thought of  and you know  it's going to be  you're going to have a test  one of them young white bitches  is going to want to put  that fucking  that little  that little nugget  that little nub  yeah  I'll be tempted  with it  yeah  it's going to happen  it's going to happen  I have to plug into a bank account 
[00:51:30]  as far as the girl is concerned  is your wife Asian  or is she American  she's Vietnamese  she grew up in the United States  yeah she's very  she's Americanized  we're both white  essentially  where do you get your Vietnamese food  in New York City  I need a place  in LA  well we live in LA  we go to  Little Saigon  Little Saigon  Orange County  about an hour away  that's where all the best  Vietnamese food  I need a place in the city  there's a place called  Mama San's up in Rochester  that's the best Vietnamese food ever  I want to bring her down here  I want to franchise her 
[00:52:00]  probably good for cheap  what's Vietnamese food  you work hard  and pay her nothing  it's like Chinese food  Vietnamese food  is the best Asian food  yeah  it's like pho  that's like your signature dish  like a noodle soup  it's like pho  pho  I love your face  what's it called  pho  like I think  P-H-O  P-H-O  oh they don't pronounce it pho  no it's like  Vietnamese  pho  pho noodles  way tastier than Chinese  way tastier  it's sweeter than Chinese food  yeah  I love Vietnamese food  it's cleaner  it's cleaner 
[00:52:30]  it's fresher  yeah it's less heavy  it's less heavy  you're not shitting  20 minutes later  yeah  and they have  instead of cooking  like a nice fork  no no let me tell you  their steamed spring rolls  are to die for  yes  that's my favorite  Vietnamese dish  just simple spring rolls  man  and they put a little  cilantro on that  it's like a little  yeah it's just cool  what do you think of  role models man  when that movie first came out  people  not much of a buzz  to be honest with you  but it's in the DVR  DVD world  that's really 
[00:53:00]  that's really blowing up  yeah  I think it's on cable  right now  it's on cable  it was 90 million dollars  worldwide  fucking 90 million dollars  it's a funny movie  but that was a slow  build for that movie  I'm telling you  we had Sean William Scott  and he does the show  from time to time  oh cool  and he was in here  he was in here  promoting Mr. Woodcock  and he openly goes  dude  this movie sucks  he rules for saying this  and he goes  if you want to see me  in a good movie  it was role models  it was either 
[00:53:30]  the next movie  that came out  or whatever  I don't remember now  but basically  he was pushing role models  even though he was  supposed to push  Woodcock that day  are you kidding me  that's great  oh he's a great  fucking guy  I love Sean  he's nuts  yeah he's  I remember seeing him  on the red carpet  he's like dude  this is the funniest movie  since American Pie  you know  he was just so  hyped for the movie  and yeah  it's like one of my  favorite movies  I've been a part of  you play the king  the king  yeah  it's so funny  that was my favorite acting  he's so serious  as being the king  it was ridiculously funny 
[00:54:00]  yeah that was the first role  I did a lot of  kind of actually worked on  like worked on  like as an actor  I don't mean to sound  all actory and pretentious  it was like  but I was doing like  I didn't know any of that  world like Dungeons and Dragons  so I actually like  went to those events  and like live events  in Malibu  and I was like  you know  LARPing  LARPing yeah  live action role play  I saw documentaries  and write books on it  it's an intense look  it's intense yeah  so I was like  no one's gonna fuck with you  yeah yeah  and by the way  staying  staying  on the Asian thing  Margaret Cho 
[00:54:30]  when she did her show  and I knew this for  a fact  all American girl  because I listened to  white people talk  all the time  we weren't paying attention  Margaret Cho  her show  it fucked up  work for Asians  for a long time  really  yeah  where they wouldn't give them  parts  and no shows  nothing  and right now  a lot of motherfuckers  the kid that plays  Sulu in Star Trek  yeah  John Cho  working  Ken's working  fucking Bobby Lee's working 
[00:55:00]  why didn't she mess up  hold on a minute  about Bobby Lee  Bobby Lee doesn't like  Ken Jeong  of course he won  he mentioned on our show  it's like  two Africans that's working  it's like  we're both from Nigeria  and we both go to work  you know  you know  Damon Johnson  who doesn't like  the motherfucker  that played  Adebisi from Oz  you know what I'm saying  so  it doesn't matter  Bobby Lee is nuts  I don't know  if we can get the clip  he's crazy  he's crazy  I think he's a little jealous  that you're getting  a lot of big  big Hollywood movies 
[00:55:30]  right now  I have him to thank for  because one of the first  guest stories I had  was on Mad TV  he put me on  so  and we did  the Kims of Comedy  so  do y'all get along  I love him  he's a character  he's surprised  he didn't know  but I  it doesn't surprise me  because he's crazy  you know what I mean  it's like  it's like what day  you know  sometimes it's hot  cold with that guy  you know  it just is  he's a weird dude  but every time I see  Bobby Lee in the comedy  store in LA  he walks like he's just  about to go do  something important  like he's like  hey hey hey  and he walks by you 
[00:56:00]  and then he just goes  and stands 10 feet away  and waits to go on  where are you rushing to  but that's Hollywood  but that's Hollywood  but you can hear  Ken  Ken is  you can hear it  he is trying to stay  humble  away from Hollywood  but you're going to  you're getting big  I'm going to crack  no you're not going to crack  but you're going to meet  that thing  that goes  Mr. Ken  you're in  are you ready  I don't think it'll ever happen  but the good thing with him  he doesn't get recognized 
[00:56:30]  on the streets  whatsoever  yes he does  he's Asian  I fit in real well  I never get right  who was in the  Kim's in comedy  that was who  but that was Bobby Lee  Steve Byrne  I thought I saw  100 Ken Jones  Steve Byrne  I know Steve  he's also a psychopath  Steve is nuts too  we're all crazy  what's the other guy  Kevin Shane  I know Kevin too  they're all fucking funny guys  Yoshi couldn't get on that  he was too dirty  hey  you know Yoshi  I know Yoshi  he is dirty  we got to go back  to the hangover  because this is unbelievable  if this is true

[00:59:30]  and it really looked painful  and it wasn't  I kind of  I was selling it  because I remember Carlito  one of the wrestlers  like  because they were all  catching me  all four wrestlers  were catching me  and Carlito was like  dude are you okay  I was like  shut the fuck up  I'm selling  I was trying to speak  wrestling talk  I'm selling  I'm selling the entry dude  don't ruin my flow  I really was doing  and Piven comes  are you okay dude  I'm selling  I'm selling  just fucking  just don't worry  just trust me  so I really was just like  trying to sell it  you know  I bought it  yeah it was great  it was great  like the boys in the back  they were all applauding  like Vince and Triple H  were hugging me 
[01:00:00]  so they were great  I love those guys  did John pick you up  over his head  yeah  you know what would be great  as he was about to throw you  if you had your mouth  by his ear  if he just went  I want to suck your cock  I would totally do that  you know what  he's such a good sport  I would totally do that  I would totally do that  he's such a good  he's like a cool guy  I would totally  yeah  have you had him on the show  John rules  a lot of those guys rule  those guys  we like just about all  wrestlers are always cool  we never had any of them  were dicks  no  Steven Milwaukee  Ken Jeong in studio  from Community  hey back to Ken  what's going on

[01:01:00]  to follow him  after he fought  nobody wanted to follow him  who was Dr. Ken  I was just never  I was really always nervous  when I did stand-up  even though I was  you don't do stand-up anymore  barely like hardly  I do a lot of it  I make the money now man  you kidding me  I fucking work door deals  and stuff  you make a shitload of money  how about you do stand-up  for us right now  what was Dr. Ken  what would you do  it was just like  kind of a  it was really like  a BET comic  as a doctor  Asian guy  it was just really like  it was really like  a lot of Asian jokes 
[01:01:30]  and it's kind of similar  to that Randy character  that Aziz Ansari  did in Funny People  like he had kind of  this Randy  it was just kind of like  it was a parody  on that a little bit  yeah it was  just kind of  it's like  faux hip hop  I don't know  it's not even hip hop  but it's just trying to  you're explaining  motherfuckers  your character  look at me like  Patrice  I'm just saying  I knew  I met him as Dr. Ken  and he would  fucking kill  as Dr. Ken  like he would destroy  as Dr. Ken  he would have a guitar 
[01:02:00]  and fucking kill  and he'd be in front  of black crowds  like just  I'm gonna YouTube  that shit later  I'll check it out  Garth in Indiana  Garth  hey guys  hey Garth  hey Garth  hey Ken  I really like your role  in Knocked Up man  thanks man  I appreciate that  you was in Knocked Up too  dude Knocked Up  Pineapple Express  stepbrothers  this is Judd Apatow  fucking mafia  when did this happen  motherfucker  when did you do that  I just auditioned  for Knocked Up  it was like three years ago  and that was it  that was really it 
[01:02:30]  that he gave me a career  I saw the epic  I saw  you hang out with that  with Seth and them  I haven't seen them  in a while  but yeah  I was hanging out  I mean I see them  from time to time  and that fucking meathead  that hates me from  who hates you  fucking  he hated me since the show  who  what is  Porkchop Head  that filmed  that  help us out  what's the movie  which movie  the monster movie  the monster movie  mask  that monster movie  where he holds  he hated me  from doing this show  he holds the camera  the whole time 
[01:03:00]  Cloverfield  oh T.J. Miller  he don't like you  he's a good guy  fucking  he don't like you  acts like we used  to go together  he doesn't speak to me  that hard  really  yeah  I've seen him  in the last fact  he's alright  T.J.'s alright  I gotta tell  T.J.'s  how come he doesn't  like you  I don't know  I think I said  I fucking didn't  like Cloverfield  and I enjoyed  his giant head  falling down  at the end  of the  but it took me  personal  like it's like  I watched it  as a fucking  as a guy  who watched a movie  Patrice beat the shit  out of Cloverfield 
[01:03:30]  oh he hated the shit  out of Cloverfield  I actually liked it  I liked it  I liked it  I saw it here  I got fucking  seasick myself  for real  it did move around  a lot  even though  Abrams came back  real hard  with Star Trek  oh man  that was great  I enjoyed it  I fucking loved  Star Trek  that was my  favorite movie  also in  Step Brothers  that's a movie  are you in  Step Brothers  I was in it  I was in it  for just a second  just like a  half a second  yeah  and you were  in fucking  Furry Vengeance  yeah that's right  you guys are in it  don't fucking point at me  I'm suing to get out 
[01:04:00]  I'm suing to get out  I hope you were very funny  in that  they said you were very funny  they said he left  by the time we got there  right right  when is that coming out  Furry Vengeance  I think it's coming out  in April  wasn't Brooke Shields nice  she was surprisingly nice  she's so nice  and cool  well her husband  is Chris Henschey  who runs Will Ferrell's  production company  Gary Sanchez Productions  if she wasn't married  would you stick it in her  fanny  oh I told her many times  who's that Brooke Shields  I told her many times  who wouldn't  yeah  she is married  she is a fucking funny  goddamn broad man 
[01:04:30]  she is great  good sport  funny  I heard she was a good sport  she came back with a story  saying she was really cool  really cool  we email each other all the time  just like  just talking shit  we didn't get that far with her  we exchanged no personal information  you got a number  no I do not  well  maybe I do  I think I do actually  I'm gonna call her  until I use Latisse  okay  Latisse  her fucking  her eyelash  shit  for growing eyelash  Brooke Shields  the product she endorses 
[01:05:00]  yeah  okay  I'll email her  I like Ken's answer though  because he knew  no one says  do you have Brooke Shields number  and you have to think about it  you know immediately  he's like  do I want to tell these guys  because they're going to  expect me to call her  see that's what I'm saying  or do I really have to  process it right now  because you know I know it  that is  those are the seeds of Hollywood  where you just  where you  yeah  you have to think about  everything you do  or it can just come 
[01:05:30]  crack  this is how  but this is how the mind works  not even offensively  ask me if I have  I'm you  say do you have Brooke Shields number  do you have Brooke Shields number  yes  but it's more sincere  and honest  I am fucking finished  I'm watching Ken  and I realize how finished I am  he's just  he's blowing up  he's very  he's blowing up  he's very pleasant  he's pleasantly  you know  he's not a fucking dick  but he's very pleasant  you can see  it's not gonna stop 
[01:06:00]  I'm gonna do something  that's gonna make  the momentum  no he's one hit  he's one hit  one more hit away  from being a complete dick  I'm one more hit away  you can tell  he's about to change  let me ask you this though  let me ask you this  and we have to think about  these things  Hollywood style  we have to think about  the reality of life  yeah  and you could be the first  but Hollywood doesn't let Asians  become superstars  Jackie Chan  except for Bruce Lee  Jackie Chan  megastar  megastar  he's karate though  that doesn't count 
[01:06:30]  karate  I'm talking about  how's your karate kick  you got one  hey how's your side kick  big guy  Lisa Lou  who is it  Lisa Lou  Lucy Lou  Lucy Lou is the  is the biggest  maybe Sandra  oh maybe  he's in  he fucking  he went back to China  probably because the integrity  of these movies  was shitty  I mean he's used to doing  this  Hollywood's strange man  Hollywood's very fucking  strategic with certain things  I'm just honestly dude  I'm just happy getting work  I'm just happy working  I'm just happy working  and providing my friend family 
[01:07:00]  that's swear  if you fuck out  just like  that's all I ever  care about  what about George  Takei  how about George  that's a good impression  yes  well they live the same  lifestyle  wait a minute  see that's it  that's the answer  I have to practice  do that one more time  like hey man  so fuck  what are you  that's all I'm happy  but it's not  well I practice  on my wife  I say man  I'm just happy  I'm getting paid  do we have  do you have enough  for the mortgage  for this month  I mean you know  why can't I fucking  that's all I care about 
[01:07:30]  just  do that  just do that  be that  you can't help it  do that  why the fuck  alright ask me  just ask me how I'm doing  how you doing  how you doing  fine man  I'm happy to just  cool  that cocksucking mother  you can't help it  you can't fucking say it  I'm just miserable  but  you gotta be a place  for somebody to be miserable  there is a loan  in your apartment  you found it  I gotta give you props  man  you're great 
[01:08:00]  The Office is like  one of my favorite shows ever  and you're like on that  for the first season  he should have been  continually on that  you should have been  one of the guys  in the warehouse  that's my  I had to look at  BJ Novak's face  for more than  half hour a day  and it just bugged me  that giant head  walking around  it was BJ's  Novak's face  that repelled you  from  yeah just  I wasn't  I realized something  I need  and this is probably  childish  and it's probably  not professional  but I really  sure it is  I enjoy coming here 
[01:08:30]  yeah  cause I like  it would have  disrupted that  I like  no  no no  I like the people  I like Jimmy  I like Anthony  I like everybody  I like coming here  cause it feels like  fucking friends  yeah  so I don't  I don't really enjoy  being funny around  people that I'm  I'm not friends with  right  I'm not that funny  that's why I love  tough crowds so much  but just to be  professional  like when you hear  things and you go  people don't  don't like each other  and they  but they do it  but they fucking  hate each other  I can't do it 
[01:09:00]  and that's  and that's  childish  but I  I really  but if you look  at Judd Apatow  it looks like  he's surrounded  himself  and same thing  with Sandler  he just surrounded  himself with a bunch  of people he enjoys  look at Rob Schneider  dude  Rob Schneider  is as  is close to  as mediocre  as you can get  he personifies  mediocre  oh yeah  but it's like  he has a friend  to cuff him  and make it  happy  I would have loved  just being on  Tough Crowd forever  and not be the star  just be 
[01:09:30]  you know  under fucking  Colin's wing  because I enjoyed  the crew  so when I did  The Office man  Steve Carell's  a nice fucking guy  everybody's nice  I just  it's just  16 hours a day  of not your friends  or not your thing  Ken has to leave  in like two minutes  right  or a minute  oh I don't  do I  fucking know  but I do remember  hey Patrice  I do remember  you did have one line  I still remember  from the show  and he said  damn it Michael 
[01:10:00]  you said that  you got a big  fucking laugh  you should have seen  the outtakes of it  the stuff that I didn't do  and that's what they kept  yeah  18 hours  yeah  to have that  my diabetes  my feet  swell up  here's the important  question  Ken's promoting  community  it's Thursdays  at 8 o'clock  on NBC  with Joel McHale  and Anthony Michael  Hall I thought  was regular  but he's not  and the important  thing is  how much influence  do you have  over who Judd  puts his next

[01:12:30]  check out  shit  people are  stupid  you wouldn't  do that  no  I'm one of  those guys  I would  do that  I don't  want to  do that  that's  kind of  morbid  and almost  like  it's very  interesting  though  but it's  like a  who cares  kind of  thing  too  like  oh  I'm  standing  here  great  what's  the most  morbid  thing  you've  checked  out  let me  see  you've  done  the  kennedy  thing  right  no  I  never  went  down  to  Dallas  that shit  is cool  yeah  that would  be  alright  that's  something  I would  check out  because  everything's  still there  you know  it's like  the buildings  and shit  you go to 
[01:13:00]  a field  it's just  still a  fucking  field  but  yeah  that I  would  check out  you don't  have a  morbid  curiosity  no  morbid  thing  remember  the  gray line  tour  in LA  yeah  yeah  yeah  where all  the famous  dead people  died  they'd show  you where  they died  and shit  I love  that shit  it's very  cool  I guess  the most  morbid  thing I  did  and it  wasn't  because  of the  haunted  thing  it was  because  of the  actual  murders  was  Amityville  horror  house  that's  cool  to  check  out  right  because  the  guy  killed 
[01:13:30]  his  family  in there  and then  I don't  understand  the  people  someone  finally  bought  that  house  and got  rid  of the  windows  that  makes  I would  buy  that  house  because  it's  the  Amityville  horror  house  and I  would  keep  it  exactly  the  same  they  changed  the  whole  look  of  the  house  so  the  cars  don't  slow down  in front  of the  house  they  actually  changed  the  address  too  I  believe  there's  so many  houses  you could  buy  you live  down  there 
[01:14:00]  right  actually  it's  not  too far  from my  place  it's  really  not  the  Amityville  horror  house  is  not  very  far  I'd  never  been  over  there  and  around  Halloween  time  I was  like  you  know  what  fuck  it  let me  go  over  there  and  take  a look  at  it  I was  very  unimpressed  A you can't tell it's the house  B in the movie they make it seem like there's all this property around it  it's just another Long Island house with another one right next to it  it's not creepy or eerie  it's just a house  it's just some shitty house  it's not shitty but it's just a neighborhood Long Island 
[01:14:30]  and they changed that barn roof look with the little quarter windows  that was the trademark  look like eyes  look like eyes  right  yeah  when I was in high school we would get some road sodas  we called them road sodas  hold on let me  ugh  let's get some road sodas  man  hey who's picking up the road sodas  road sodas  that's awful  isn't that horrible  and then we would go like after we had a few road sodas in a parking lot somewhere 
[01:15:00]  we go hey let's go check out the Amityville horror house and drive to the south shore  yeah  and then it took you like an hour just to find the fucking thing  yeah you gotta find it  but in the middle of the night it's kinda  it used to be kinda a cool thing to do  a little creepy  yeah  but the windows were the very important part  you'd see it and be like that's the house  so some asshole buys it and then changes the whole look  yeah  cause you would buy that house and go fuck yeah  I'll make my house an attraction for everybody  I don't care  that's it now?  or is that it like then?  is that what it looks like? 
[01:15:30]  I can't see it now on google  is that from the uh  googley?  what is it called?  is there a canal behind it or something?  yeah uh huh  yeah  yep yep yep yep yep  112 ocean  oh wait  I don't remember there being so much front yard  or is that deceiving?  I don't remember looking at that  no that's  it's deceiving  that's not that big a yard at all  yeah it's not  it's  it's  and look at the front  it's just like  you would never know  which windows were changed now?  I don't remember any of this anymore  yeah  zoom in  cause that used to be uh  yeah  it used to be like those barn style  yeah  oh right  so they just put square windows 
[01:16:00]  oh okay  yeah yeah  yeah you faggots  would you still like go in there and sleep?  absolutely  yeah  I didn't think the movie was that scary  I know  it was  the movie sucked as a matter of fact  I would be kinda creeped out  it would be kinda creepy  old houses creep me out in general  I went to that hotel in fucking Colorado once  and I couldn't sleep the whole fucking night  alright let me ask you something about that  so you go into an old hotel or an old house  you definitely get creeped out or get a feeling right? 
[01:16:30]  yeah  I don't think I have any special powers  but most of us get a creeped out feeling  what is that based on?  is that  do you think it's an actual energy that we don't understand yet?  or do you think it's because  it's old?  I think it's your own fear  it's your own fear and unfamiliarity  but why don't you get that in like a newer house?  because it's  it's  it's  you know  I guess you're not thinking  about the history as much  I know when I was sleeping in old houses  as a kid too  it was kinda creepy because 
[01:17:00]  like the keyholes were those literal keyholes  right right  and the big crystal-y doorknobs  and shit  but what is it based on?  and the room kinda had a smell of  that it wasn't new  does it make you feel like  oh boy  dead people did live here  yeah yeah  like people that have lived here  are dead  and  and you know  I would love to know what that's based on  I mean you're explaining it a little bit I guess  it was lived in  like the house had been lived in  but you could go in a house  that's uh 
[01:17:30]  20 years old  yeah  it depends  sometimes you do get the creeps  in a 20 year old house too  so then maybe it is an energy  I think it's more motif  I think it's more you go in there  and if it's  it looks old  and it's not revamped  and painted  and shit  the carpet's worn  where people were walking  so why I think weird shit  just cause it was old?  I don't know  because you think about  the people and history of the house  like my house  no one ever lived in it  why didn't you sleep  when you were in Colorado 
[01:18:00]  cause it was a  haunted hotel  they sold it as that  like you went in  and it was almost like  the Overlook Hotel  and uh  it was very  western  style  and uh  they  they had a  pamphlet  at the desk  and you would read it  and it would tell you stories  about certain rooms  and hallways  where a woman  you'll see a woman  um  crying  uh  looking for her child  that died  and I'm just like  I don't need to  fucking read this  but the thing is 
[01:18:30]  why did you go there then?  because we were  uh  uh  we were a little  fucking like  drunk  and it seemed fun  and it seemed fun  to read it  when it was still  light out  and shit  and it's like  oh fuck  look  there's go  and then the second  it gets dark  I'm thinking about  this shit  going  why did I read that?  yeah cause now  you're scared  out of your mind  cause now I'm in the room  I don't care how old you are  some of that shit  will scare you  and I thought  I was thinking  if something happens  if I see something  I'm gonna die  like I would  fucking just 
[01:19:00]  lose my shit  and I don't know why  like if I literally  saw a ghost  I would be like  ah  it would scare  the shit out of me  you ever get in a situation  like that  where you are  like kinda laying in the bed  and you refuse  to open your eyes  cause you don't know  what you're gonna say  or look at a corner  too long  a dark corner  oh my god  yeah  it's fucking still a baby  I know  it's like  I'm a grown man  why like this  this guy goes  Owen Hayer  queers  we must  you know what  we must be  what the fuck  come on  what the fuck  we must be  ghosts 
[01:19:30]  really  I'm a grown man  and I'll play that game  with my eyes  like don't open your eyes  you don't know  what you're gonna say  yes  what is that  Jay Jones  or something like that  look at old paneling  and see faces  oh my god  when you look at old  wood paneling  and you see like  these morbid  twisted  the scream faces  yes  yes  yes  that's very scary  what is that based on  or you see like  a chair in the corner  with a pillow 
[01:20:00]  the wrong way  and you have to  get up and move it  because it  you can't  stop looking at it  right  it looks like  someone's sitting  in the chair  oh yeah  Iraq  you ever been  like maybe in your house  been in the basement  and it sounds like  somebody's walking  upstairs right above  the room that you're in  in the basement  no  used to happen  in my first house  what was that  we don't know  but I remember  being a little kid  was there an apartment  upstairs dummy  no  it's a small house  in Brentwood  and this  we'd be downstairs  in the finished basement 
[01:20:30]  watching TV  and if you turn the TV off  it sounds like  somebody's running  in the hallway  going to the bedrooms  in the room above you  that's kind of creepy  look man  I have a brother  he's convinced  that the house  he lived in  in Westchester  was sold to  what  was haunted  oh  like toilets  would flush  in the middle of the night  how is that possible  explain that one to me  some plumber  well  I would think  if the flapper  in the tank  was faulty  and water  was able to get  under there 
[01:21:00]  wouldn't it just  run all night  well it would  sometimes it would run  but if water  was able to get  under there  and lift the flap  up it would flush  like a faulty  seal between  the flapper  and the  actual  drain  I'm going to have to  call him  maybe today  because he had  a lot of shit  that went on  in that house  I'm now convinced  there's a ghost  and he wasn't  one of those guys  so who knows  who the fuck  by the way  of course  we're wrong  with the  Leonard Skinner  info  of course  it wasn't  of course  the listener 
[01:21:30]  was wrong  with that one  too  what was it  a lot of people  saying it was  a Convair  Convair  Convair 240  do you know that one  never heard of it  well you know this shit  don't you  yeah I know  a lot about planes  but I don't know  that one  oh that kind of does  wow  a CV240  does that make sense  that's old  well it happened  yeah that does  kind of look like  the plane  it was a propeller  plane  yeah I don't think  it was a jet  right  oh really  makes sense  that looks like  an old DC-8 
[01:22:00]  what's a propellers  fuck that  yeah  the Marshall football  team died in a DC-9  that was a terrific  movie  did you watch that  yeah  I couldn't be bothered  it was a Convair 240  it was a Convair 240  yeah  at least that's  according to the  Wikipedia  the DC-3  worked in a building  that is haunted  fucked with the ghost 
[01:22:30]  freaked him out  alright let's  haunted  do you believe in ghosts  I absolutely do  I don't know  yeah  yeah  I have a good story  for you actually  let's go  alright give it a try  we'll be the judge  Bridgewater Sports Arena  in New Jersey  I have a ton of ghost stories  but this is the most recent one  and this place is built on an Indian burial ground supposedly  everyone that works there  how many Indians were there  I'm going to pause for a second  how many Indians were there to be buried everywhere  why does it always have to be an Indian burial ground  it's with the Indians 
[01:23:00]  yeah there were other people that were buried  right  why are they so special  yes  I've got no idea  but anyway  I'm in the pro shop  and I'm there all alone  and it's late at night  and all of a sudden  I look down at the end of this back hallway  and it's kind of blurry a little bit  like the air  like he's coming off a pavement almost  and then I walk down there  I go  is there anyone here  and it's kind of  like I got a real uncomfortable feeling  and I said  alright fine  use my energy  like those ghost shows or whatever  and move something  I want to see you do something 
[01:23:30]  I think you're a pansy  and shit you not  a replacement blade  that was sitting on the ledge  flew right the fuck off  and just slammed on the ground  and I ran outside  and chain smoked  for about 20 minutes  wow  holy shit  they listen to you huh  just from you watching  some ghost shit on TV  that's scary  come on  I can't deal with that shit  come on  come on  freak me out guys  alright guys  punch it out  I need  I need  I need  stuff I can shoot at  if it gets scary  you can't shoot ghosts 
[01:24:00]  no you can't  ghosts  ghosts  ghosts  ghosts  but you can shoot  well  that's different  of course  that's quite  a different scenario  that's a different scenario  Mr. Hughes  isn't that a form of a ghost  you know  you want to talk to a funeral director  why  is it haunted  is this something about ghosts  yeah let's 
[01:24:30]  let's put them on  for a little bit  I'm frightened  I still don't know  what happened  with my funeral home story  I tell you  when my dad  my dad's wake  you know  you had to be there  for three straight days  so I started wandering around  to see who else  was in the joint  oh no  you don't do that  and they were setting up  for a grandma funeral  she had her pearls on  her hair done  her makeup done  open casket  I was the only person  in the room  I swear to you  I've told this story  fucker  and I  fucked her  fucked her 
[01:25:00]  good  walking in the front of the room  I'm going to check out  this dead body  no one's around  and I swear to you  the lights went off  when I went in the front of the room  so I don't know  if someone was walking by  and said  I'm going to fuck  with this person  did you shit your pants  yes I fucking shit my pants  I was like  what  because now you're in a dark room  with a dead person  well it was like  off and on  they flickered  it was more of that  they went off  and then on  holy shit  so I'm like  alright  and then I turn around quickly 
[01:25:30]  and then I quickly  got out of the room  to see  alright  who did that  to this day  I don't know  so someone could have  easily just fucked with me  and decide never to tell me  that I was that  so that's so creepy  yeah  I swear to you  that happened  fuck  right when I was at the front  looking at her  literally  right there  right there  that is  that's too creepy  yeah but it could have been  just someone fucking with me  that's the problem  with these stories  I guess  is why I'm bringing it up  but people could be  fucking with you  and never tell you  so then you go through  your life  thinking there's ghosts now 
[01:26:00]  or some shit going on  right right  you know what I mean  yeah  but still  all that  it was really fucking  that would freak me out  Joe on Long Island  Joe  how do you doing  how you doing guys  funeral director  alright yes  morbid  look I never believed in ghosts  I never believed in any of that  I never really did  I've been in the funeral industry  for about 8-9 years  now we built a brand new  funeral home  where there was nothing here  was there an Indian burial ground  Indian burial ground  always an Indian burial ground  you can't get away from those engines 
[01:26:30]  that's these fucking stories  start with that  no  there used to be a restaurant  back like in the 50s  so  less people got killed in the 50s  that means nothing  but when I tell you  I always look for ghosts  I like  I watch ghost adventures  go through all that  and I forget the day  I walked into work  it was early in the morning  there was no one in the building  I heard someone say hello  and let me tell you  I almost  hello  it was  no no no  but what I'm telling you  it was  there was literally  no one in there  I walked in the door  and it was someone 
[01:27:00]  that said hello  other experiences  when I'm in the prep room  at night  I'm in the girl  wait wait wait  thank you Anthony  let's slow down  oh no  what goes on in the prep room  well the embalming  you know preparation of the body  do you really hang the body  so they drain  no you don't do that  okay  you put them in that  do you put them on that metal table  with the little neck thing  we have an old ceramic table  that's a ceramic table  and do you  do you use that little thing  it almost looks like a bridge 
[01:27:30]  when you're playing pool  and you put their head on that  it's a head block  it's a head block  you gotta chalk up their head  with the head block  you gotta head block  what are some of the other tools  in the prep room  oh there's a bunch of tools  that we use  that big fucking  that big needle thing  that sucks the shit out  that's called the troll car  yes  why do you have to suck the shit out  to put the shit in  what shit  you gotta treat the visceres  you gotta suck out 
[01:28:00]  all the fucking fluid  and replace it  with fucking like  chemicals  I wanna go to the other side  with my fluids  leave my fluids alone  they take your fluids  what if you need your fluids  you don't  well then you keep them  you don't get embalmed  yeah but  yeah but why do you even  need to be embalmed  because then you'd be  stinking and rotten  in front of your family  what a tough shit  I want everything that  I want everything to go with me  where does  where does the fluids go  yeah what do you do  you just put it down the drain  well no  here in Suffolk County 
[01:28:30]  we have to put it  it's called blood in a box  alright but let's be honest  blood in a box  you guys are all trying  to cut corners  the economy is bad  even for the funeral guys  where are you dumping  the blood  no it gets put in a box  and we have a company  come and pick it up  once a week  biohazard company  yep  and what do they do with it  I don't know  feed it to the pigs  oh god  oh my god  that's why the pork  there's a solidifier  in there  it makes it like  a hard gel  and they pick it up  once a week  wait wait  you solidify it  into a hard gel 
[01:29:00]  that's yeah  you have to  there's this powder  you put in the bucket  it's like a 5 gallon bucket  and there's a powder  you put in there  and it solidifies  it makes it  like a hard gel  who the fuck  decided that  we need to do this  I never do this  sloshing around  yeah but who decided  you have to take the fluids  out to put the fluids in  yay pudding  oh god  I think we found  our next contest  oh god  somebody gelatized  or whatever you would call it 
[01:29:30]  yeah  blood in a box  that's nice  are you one of those  funeral directors  you don't actually  do anything with the bodies  you just kind of  throw them in the woods  and let them pile up  until the authorities  find you  snap the legs  because he doesn't  fit in the casket  right  that's what only happens  out there  sell the bones  sell the bones  to medical companies  and then just put pipes  in there or PVC  that was a good one  the guy that was  fucking replacing  the bones with pipes  really  yeah  those are the guys  out in Brooklyn  that said that  yeah huh  why would you  I understand 
[01:30:00]  taking the bones out  why would you  replace them  why wouldn't you  put like an afghan  over the body  so they don't know  there's no bones  left in there  yeah I don't know  why you replace  them with pipes  but  I don't either  like he's gonna  get up and start  walking  they're calling it  vampire jello  the other black listeners  vampire jello  vampire jello  that's good stuff  they replace your  with PVC  like if you're  a long bone donor  they replace  everything with PVC  that gives you  structure and  everything to make  it look like  oh right  it holds everything  up still  so the legs  don't flatten out 
[01:30:30]  and shit like that  so if you do  donate your bones  they pop PVC  in there  yep  wow  you just like  fucked at the end  oh my god  I don't understand  why you have to  do all this shit  just to be buried  and what  I never understood  this  what happens  with the organs  they stay in  for what  any normal case  or a long bone donor  normal case  normal case  everything stays in there  stays in  but you just pump  the fucking  embalming fluid  all around it  yep  and then we  and then we  treat it with that  troco  you were talking  about that 
[01:31:00]  big needle  we treat it  afterwards  with that  what do you do  with the bunghole  do you have to  seal up the bunghole  no dude  they tell you  in school  that you should  put it  they call it  an AV plug  it's an anal  and like  vagina plug  anal and vagina plug  that's called  my cock  anybody who does  that  is a sick fuck  oh really  oh that's sick  also you have  a whole box  of those plugs  unused  pristine  he sells it  to Dr. Steve 
[01:31:30]  to seal his wine  with it  yeah  right  so  you're not  a big advocate  of the anal  vagina plug  no I'm good on that  now why would  why would you  like why would  you have to  do that  if you do  use those plugs  they want to  prevent the body  from leaking  from leaking  and it leaks  out of the ass  it could leak  from anywhere  but usually  sometimes  I mean it usually  doesn't but  they tell you  too  I've never  seen it  and if I  see it  I'll take  care of it  with plastics  or something 
[01:32:00]  have you ever  had a coffin  that's just  dripping fluids  during a  wake  no  no  like an old  Buick in the  garage  I love how  this guy has  to be the  perfect funeral  director  you know  some shit  happens  oh you know  it  you know  it  oh no  I mean  some things  happen  I mean  but  I mean  I don't know  what do you do  do you like  take care of  things artistically  and do you have  to cover up  bullet holes  and fucking  car accident  wounds  and shit  yeah  so what do you  use like  spackle 
[01:32:30]  I use wax  use a lot  of wax  wax  wax  or they  in school  they teach you  how to use  chicken wire  and like  plaster  of paris  chicken wire  and plaster  of paris  what would you  use that for  you could  reconstruct  a face  like that  with chicken  wire  like say  their face  is caved  in or  something  how about  you close  the coffin  yeah  yeah  yeah  some people  like it  closed  I mean  people  just use  wax  I mean  it's so much  easier  wax  it's so much  easier  to use  I went  to an 
[01:33:00]  open  casket  recently  and it  was a  young  guy  it's  rough  man  my great  great aunt  open  casket  whatever  but younger  people  open  casket  that's  rough  yeah  yeah  you don't  want to  see that  that's a  rough one  I don't  know why  people do  that  oh god  it depends  on how bad  the body is  usually we  could pretty  much fix  anything  imagine  really  fix  anything  I'll tell  you what  it is  an open  casket  is a buzz  kill for  everybody else  in the room  it is  because you're 
[01:33:30]  kind of  like socializing  and you're  catching up  like oh  there I have  it's in your  wall  and you glance  over  too bad  are the  circumstances  but how's  the family  how's your job  how's that  move to LA  and then you  look oh yeah  dead guy  in the front  of the room  great  fucks up  the mood  man  close the  coffin  so we  can socialize  close the  lid  we'll assume  he's in  there  exactly  put a nice  picture on  top  yeah  but the people  walk in  it's also  for closure  people walk in  they get a little  emotional beginning  and once everybody  and the friends  start showing up  everybody starts 
[01:34:00]  laughing and  you know they  don't have to  pay attention  to what's going  on in the  front of the  room anyway  how about  I want to  invent this  a slide door  window type  thing  California has  that  they actually  do  what  that was  a complete  joke  like a drive  through  if you can't  make it in  there you can  just drive  through and  have the  casket by  the window  and you can  do one of  those  are you talking  about wait  wait I think  I was talking  about on the  casket  so if you want  to see him  you can go  so right  so right  and then you  shut it  and then if  someone doesn't  want to  they don't  have to  open the 
[01:34:30]  hatch  do a little  laughing action  all right  laughing like  jokes  you laugh  but it's not  the worst idea  in the world  no that would  kind of be  especially on the  top of the  thing there's  the little  sliding thing  you want to  see him  there you go  slide away  slide it open  why not  and the eyes  are open  looking at you  and then you  shut it and  you open it  back up and  the eyes are  closed again  creepy  Indian burial  ground  or something  always Indian burial  ground  that's some  woman just  walking around  going  i'm spending  eternity with a 
[01:35:00]  vagina plug  take out my  vagina plug  like just walking  around  help me  help remove my  vagina plug  vagina plug  that'd be so scary  that would rock  oh god this creepy  ghostly music  what movie is  this from  i have an  anal plug  remove my 
[01:35:30]  anal plug  that's scary  well guys look  unfortunately i gotta  go i just pulled  off  they could wait  yeah where are  they going  where the fuck  are they going  yeah you're in the  only business where  people could actually  wait  take a break  really man  stop taking it so  seriously  really  what's wrong with  you  did you even tell 
[01:36:00]  your story  oh no i didn't  even tell it  we don't know  what his story was  oh really fast joe  i'm sorry  real fast your story  before you go  what happened was  i was here late  one day and i was  preparing the body  i was the only one  here i had all the  doors locked  i'm in the prep  room i'm just  finishing up and  all of a sudden  inside the funeral  home by the prep  room the door  starts banging  somebody was  banging on the  door  once again i freaked  out i went to go  open the door  there was two  garbage scales in  the middle of the  hallway  and i'm like 
[01:36:30]  what the fuck  indian burial  i mean  i mean this  happens all of a  sudden  why can't it  just be a  friend of yours  just completely  fuck with you  and never telling  you  that would be  good  and how would  they get in  all those  blocks  yeah  yeah  i guess it's  a ghost  because if i'm  in the back  i lock all the  doors no one  can walk in  and roll around  ghosts  i wish jimmy  was here  because i love  his  ghosts  well that was  spooky 
[01:37:00]  yeah  all right  get to work  um  all right uh  joe thanks  thanks for uh  humoring us  today  wax  i think all you  guys are  ghoulish  i know  there's just a  morbid thing  getting into that  line of work  do you look at  death differently  do i yeah  you look at  life differently  you do  how profound  you never know  when it's gonna  happen  all right  it's like a box  of chocolates  you don't think  that's in the back  of every single  person's head  yeah  well a big  clump of wax too  if you have your  back of your head  blown out 
[01:37:30]  chicken wire  chicken wire  and plaster  a fucking  it's a second  grade school  project  i would be a  shitty funeral  director  i sucked at  the chicken  wire  oh yeah  and then what  was it  the plaster  of paris  shit  i sucked at  that  this is the worst  of the opie and anthony show  serious  xm  what's up out there  this is ice tea  and this is coco  and you're listening to the worst  of the opie and anthony show  oh yeah 
[01:38:00]  that means one thing  ice tea is in the  studio  i was ready to say in the house  and i'm in the house  i would have sounded really  really old school  yeah  when the building  i'm reading in the prep sheet  i have  i never knew this  you were in the break-in films  yeah that's where i was  that was my first time  being in movies  what did you do in break-in  or break-in 2  oh okay  you were just  you had a small part  like you know  when shabba doo and boogaloo  shrimp and them were  in the club  i was the guy on the stage  and i was rapping 
[01:38:30]  it was kind of like  a featured background person  i didn't have lines  i just rapped  i think i did know that actually  maybe i have heard that before  i haven't watched  the break-in movies in a while  i thought beach street  was a little better  i mean you know  from my experience  in white suburban  north brunswick  i have no idea  which one was more realistic  but i preferred beach street  and we want to say  good morning to coco too  of course  who's here with ice tea  i'm here  yes right early  i was just telling ice tea  that usually we like to  see the show  before you guys come in  and we didn't get  an advanced copy  and then you said 
[01:39:00]  quickly that it's a comedy  well you know  we went to shoot the show  eight years ago  they came at us  to shoot a show  coco did this thing  called hip-hop wives  and they wanted to do  one i was like  nah  reality show  to break up the marriage  and everything  i'm not with it  you know  ten years  you know  eight years later  they kept coming  e  they kept coming  and finally i said  look  we'll do it  under one  circumstances  that you really  shoot us  you get us  and you don't twist it  you know  my relationship  is important to me  if we fight  or whatever  we'll do it 
[01:39:30]  but don't add anything  fake drama  yeah  no fake drama  like assisted reality  assisted  or edited in a way  to make it worse  than it really was  right  crap  after the first show  they said  you guys got a comedy  you know  and i'm like  i'm funny  and we started to look  at the scenes  and i'm like  kind of funny  you know  when you look at it  yeah  so it came out  as a comedy  and we shot all eight shows  i've seen them  we're very happy with them  and i'm very critical  you know  i'm protecting myself 
[01:40:00]  i'm not gonna lie  but i didn't touch  one frame of any show  i just said  let it go  it looks good  oh there's nothing  you wanted out  you were following all of it  i mean you know  i'm in control  of what i do  i just like i say  i just don't need a twist  or something put on there  you know  so they they got the tone of it  and i'm very happy of it  so it's a reality show  i'm proud of  but coco will tell you  it's like we broke the trend  well i believe we broke the trend  because nowadays  everything is a train wreck  you know  and it seems  this is really a housewife show  and you see  this is uh 
[01:40:30]  if you lay across  like every network  has like a housewife show  including housewives of this  housewives of that  housewife  and it's like  they they seem to be  unhappy  yeah  you know  and this is the one  in a mansion  and this is the one  in a mansion right  and this is the one  housewife show  where i'm very happy  yeah  and i've proved  that we can be together  for 10 years  and still be happy  and under the circumstances  that i i work for ice  you know  i'm his assistant  so i'm not just  the housewife 
[01:41:00]  that stays at home  i'm the cute housewife  that is an assistant  she's like my  sharon osborne  she keeps me together  holds it there  yeah  you know  who's the boss though  because sharon  certainly runs that operation  well i'm very organized  anal person  you know  don't say anal  all these guys  he's got erections  that's your brain  that's an opium  i know what goes on  he's reading the room  he's reading pretty accurate  why do you make it so easy for us  but i am 
[01:41:30]  i'm very very  i'm very much of a perfectionist  and um  you know  he needs that  his his life was so unorganized  when i came in  you know  and i just slightly  organized him  and here he is  you know  he's still  i mean i guess if you say  who's the boss  at the end of the day  i'll have the final say  but i don't  my job is not to override  everything she's doing  because i have her in charge  trying to make things right  so we got to balance it out  you know  some guys just don't want  their woman to have any say 
[01:42:00]  so i'm like  well then it's only one person  running the show  i mean  i appreciate  having a partner  because a lot of things  and as an artist  i can generate money  i'm just not into  crossing the t's  and dotting the i's  you know  that's just not my thing  so i want to do the art  and i would watch  just osborns  and i'm like  would ozzy have a mansion  if it wasn't for shit  i mean does he even know  he's on tv  you know  and i'm a big fan of oz  you know  and when he does his thing  can nobody touch him  but that's his thing  now paying phone bills 
[01:42:30]  i don't know if that's what i  yeah ozzy's not a receipt saver  right right right  exactly  we'll write this dinner off  yeah i can't see him saying that  that's probably not ozzy's thing either  you're right  but that's what she does  a lot of artists  but do you  i hope you watch the money  because a lot of artists  especially with royalties  musicians  get fucked by the companies  and by people  because they don't watch  the the trail  it's hard for me  i've already done that  i've already you know  lost the money  because of that  fortunately i've been in the game  25 years  so i've gone through that 
[01:43:00]  that that zone  of wasting money  i had 15 cars  you know  giving all your money  to your friends  and i've been through that  and i've been through that  business managers  and managers  and whatever  that don't look out for you  the whole thing  but fortunately  i've been able to sustain  and you know  now that i've gotten  on law and order  i've been on there  12 years  i've got my books  tight and everything  so i i i survived  the uh you know  the coming of age  of a celebrity  where you usually  if you don't make it  past that point  you're through  you know what  he just described 
[01:43:30]  mc hammer  who we had in here  yeah  and he didn't  he couldn't keep  sustaining it  and that's the problem  with mc hammer  so he gave all his money  away as he was going  but then all of a sudden  the money stopped coming in  and then he was in deep trouble  there's a guilt  that goes along with success  you know  when you're making it  and all your friends aren't  and you want to help them  bring some people up  yeah  you know  you can't even come around  your neighborhood  in a new car  because everybody's still broke  and you want to see  your friends come  and you want to go on vacation  but you don't want new friends 
[01:44:00]  so you bring your friends  it starts to cost a lot of money  you know  but after you've done it  for a long enough time  now my boys is like  Ice already paid us  he did more than he had to do  can he live  let him live  let him live  he doesn't owe anybody  nothing  you know  so I've made it through  that growing period of fame  and people that come from nothing  they understand that  you know  you got your family  and it's not that they're asking for it  you feel guilty in a way  to say I won  because of your success you mean  or like you have 
[01:44:30]  what they don't have  and it's like  yeah  yeah  you start to feel like  I'm obligated to do something  and then there's some that will  Sugar Ray Leonard was in the other day  and in his book  he's talking about the people  and how they just don't stop  asking you for money  family friends  well you just gotta say no  after a while  it's hard though right  it's hard  it's hard  but after a while  and then you say no  you say I'm not doing it anymore  I'm that  you tell them  look I gotta pay taxes  I got this  I got that  and they go  and I can tell my friends  look man  I owe a million dollars  and I gotta do this  and I gotta do that  and I'm having this  and they go  okay 
[01:45:00]  I get it  yeah it's bad  but can I still borrow  five jeans  it's like no matter  what you say  they're like looking  at what they see  and they  you're on TV  you know  I mean how can  you not  right right  by the way  you missed  let me tell everybody  what they missed  Ice-T said you're on TV  and three desperate faces  looked up  he was speaking  kind of metaphorically  we've had a wild two days  so  yeah it got a little crazy 
[01:45:30]  yeah  I wanted to ask you  about going  pretty much from  gangsta to mainstream  over the years  you successfully  pulled that off  were you catching  any flack  when you first  kind of started  going mainstream  about your street cred  and people going  like you sell out  and shit like that  the only time  I ever get it  is from a square  you know  like the cats  from the hood  know  they're happy  to see me successful  you know what I'm saying  they know  that you know  when you're in the streets 
[01:46:00]  doing that  you're doing that  because those are the options  that are open to you  as new options open  if you don't take them  you're a sucker  you coming from the ghetto  complaining about  not having an opportunity  then you get an opportunity  and you don't take it  then you're a sucker  now you got corny people  on the sideline  oh he's lost his street cred  you know  what the fuck do you know  about street cred  any damn way  you know  I mean my street cred  is bulletproof  I've done  whatever has to be done  to get the street cred  that's why I just wrote  put out my new book 
[01:46:30]  called ISIS Road  from South Central  to Hollywood  and it shows  the transition  but  you know  those who say  don't know  and those who know  don't say  I'm far from a cop  trust me  trust me  you know  I'm a good actor  I love that explanation  you put out by the way  the book right  Pimp  you put out  I wrote the forward  to Pimp  by Iceberg Slim  right  like you kind of  re-released it  or whatever  yeah you know  because I admired Iceberg  and that's where I got my name 
[01:47:00]  but then at some point  in reading the books  of course at first  I wanted to live his life  then I realized  he's a writer  at some point  it hit me  like he's a writer  so if I really want to be  held forever  in people's hearts  and in their minds  I need to document the game  it's not about being  the biggest hustler  on the street  it's the one  who wrote about it  that's who gets  to you know  last forever  it's an amazing book  I've read it twice  I've read it too  love it  when was he alive  like the 40s  he was  we just did a movie  on his life too  we did a documentary 
[01:47:30]  on It's Not Done  but you know  that's what my music  was meant to be  like documentation  of the game  are there photos of him  and who was the guy  the other one  who had the cat  Miss Peaches  who was that  the tall  the tall bald  pimp who I think  he got everything from  that's the guy  I want to see a photo of  oh my god  damn  it's probably been a while  right  yeah I'm supposed  to know that name  I don't know it either  yeah  probably his name  was Mac  that's a good name 
[01:48:00]  for a pimp  Mac  you know  but you know  that's what it is  so if you read my book  my book is kind of like  in the same sense  it shows the growth  and it shows  all the different channels  I went through  in music  and yeah  then how do you end up  on Law and Order  right  how did that happen  but you know  that was a great run  hey I'm still on it  you know  I just re-signed  for another couple years  so you know  I'm able to do that  then I'm over here  doing my rock band  playing Cop Killer  over on this side of town  and you know 
[01:48:30]  it's just  those people  that really know me  when they watch  our TV show  they'll laugh  they'll go  yo that's ice right there  because I'm comfortable  with who I am  some of the  music you did  years ago  does it kind of  seem silly now  all the fuss  that was made of it  when you look at  what's going on  in music today  and on the internet  and what not  yeah well you know  come on  I mean everything  seems silly  in retrospect  it's like  it's like the news  is real stupid  period  you know  it's like every time 
[01:49:00]  you know  breast implants  will explode  on a plane  oh you know  every time  every time  I'm like  what happened  did pitbull  stop biting people  that was like  happening for a while  that was the big story  yeah like the big stories  just rotate  so I was just  one of the big stories  right right  it's all stupid  I mean considering  what's really going on  yeah you know what  at the time  it was such a big story  and everybody  was totally hating you  and it almost seems  nostalgic  and kind of  funny now 
[01:49:30]  that there was  such a fuss  made of  you know music  the president  was after me  but now I have something  how many people  can actually say  that the president  of the United States  of America  spoke their name  in anger  you and Kanye West  yeah  you really are  even when Kanye  came out and said  the president  doesn't like black people  I'm like  have you listened  to Public Enemy  it's like  this is not  a new comment  you know  this is new  but Kanye  you know  he said something  at the time  and you know 
[01:50:00]  when you look down there  and you look at  New Orleans  where he was  he saw those people  sitting out in the street  and the floods  that's how it seemed  it didn't really look  like anybody cared  I don't see  I don't think  Beverly Hills  would have been  floating around  that long  yeah  he spoke his mind  and then  god damn  Michael Myers  Mike Myers  was next to him  at the time  and his face  just  he looked  and I'm like  why am I  dragged into this  he just wanted to  read a few lines  and get off this thing 
[01:50:30]  I've never seen  such a pretend  that didn't just  happen  he just stared  straight ahead  hoping everything  would go away  and he'd wake up  and he wouldn't be there  you see any  of the other  PE guys  oh definitely  I just did a movie  I just finished  directing a movie  called The Art of Rap  where I interviewed  a lot of emcees  from back in the days  Chuck D of course  and it's more  of a movie  about  how  how you rap  not the money  the girls  the cars  it's like  the art form 
[01:51:00]  right  so we're gonna  have that out  later this summer  too  what do you think  changed about  like cause you  listen to rap  from like the  like Run DMC  and the way they were  and the way it is now  lyrically it's a lot  different  it went pop  you think it got more pop  no it's pop  it's pop music  now  now what you're doing  is you're listening  to what you're hearing  on the radio  it's pop music  with a rap delivery  see you could rap  anybody can rap  but that's not hip hop  hip hop has a special  sound to it  it has a special  vibe to it  but when you  you know you're doing  a pop record 
[01:51:30]  and then you  then you just  happen to rap  that doesn't  you know  pink can rap  you know  there's a lot of people  that can rap  so it's lost its soul  if you ask me  but I say that  meaning I want to  inspire the soul  to come back  I'm not saying it  like a hater  I just want the kids  to bring the soul back  I'd love to see  an 18 year old  public enemy group  come out right now  young kids  or a new KRS-1  because no matter  what we do  we're old now  we're older than them  we're the parents age 
[01:52:00]  so the kids don't want  so they need somebody  from their generation  to come out  and rock the world  what happened to KRS-1  it's like I  he's still out there  but you know  once  now since we live  in a pop culture  if you're not on the radio  then people don't think  you exist  you know  you have to be  on the radio  the little girls  right now  they're like  if it's not on MTV  then it must not be good  and then MTV  doesn't even play music anymore  one last thing  I was talking to a 21 year old girl  the other day  doing an interview  she said  Ice 
[01:52:30]  about music  and I said  well I made my money in music  when people went to the record store  she said  what's a record store  I swear to god  and I said  like Tower  oh no  like  where how  she said  like Best Buy  oh shit  and I said  well they're trying to sell microwaves  really  and Best Buy  is even pushing  kind of the music out  you go to Best Buy  and try to find something  they don't care  nothing's in an alphabetical order anymore  it's just kind of  just thrown around  it's all electronic delivery 
[01:53:00]  you ever think  you'd see the day  that there would be  no bookstores  and no record stores  in our lifetime  are you crazy  dude  I got people  you know  cause I'm from the music business  every day  an artist walks up to me  I want to get put on  Ice  can you help me  and I ask them  I say  well what's the last record you bought  and they give me this blank face  I'm like  so this is the industry  you're trying to get into  now you ask why I'm on television  right  god damn yeah  you can't  I went to get the Aussie box set 
[01:53:30]  of course you did  I know  of course you did  every discussion goes back to Aussie  but I tried to  I went to Best Buy  they didn't have it  it's like you had to order it  or go to a specialty store in Jersey  you can't get  any type of specialty  stuff like that  unless it's the Beatles  or somebody that's gonna sell everyone  it's crazy  Wiener's on TV  what the hell was that guy  oh yeah  well  I think he's just trying to live up to his name  right  yeah the Wiener thing  that was not that impressive a dick  I'm sorry  it just wasn't  no  all smoke and mirrors  no it was the fact that  you know he was  you know he's a politician 
[01:54:00]  he was lying  oh so what does that do  a politician lying  and showing porn  exactly  pictures of themselves  they're all doing it  it's like  everybody is  doing that shit  it's just you know  you don't want to see  when you say politician  immediately I think creepy  thank you  yeah yeah  I'm with Ice-TL  I think lying sack of shit  and uh  yeah creepy  doesn't matter  I think helpful  and it doesn't matter  what side  so I  yeah absolutely  cross the board for me  hey uh  Coco's just sitting there 
[01:54:30]  looking all  beautiful  looking all beautiful  and we got a reality show  I know  she loves sitting around  the men when we chop it up  you know  I do  yeah that's how a woman learns  like let the men talk  release a secret  oh there we go  Ice-TL  he could sit here all day  and just chat  I don't think he even knows  that he's talking  I love talking to the homies  I love when I'm in a room  full of real live cats  it's fun  now I'm with some squares  I'm ready to quit  I'm like okay  enough talking to you guys  you're draining my cool 
[01:55:00]  I got an observation  I always  I always felt like  Ice-T was really scary  you're really likable  I'm likable  until you cross me  but this is the first time  we've met you  I mean what I've seen  like over the years  I'm like man  he's intimidating  I'm not  but you're a very  likable guy sir  I think I've lightened him up too  you like him  oh really  yeah  the most dangerous cats  I've ever met  are the most likable cats  yes  oh man  yeah  they're the kind of 
[01:55:30]  like smile  and they laugh with you  and show you the pictures  of the kids  and they'll take a dinner fork  and pull your fucking eye out of your head  you know  it's the guys that act tough  all the time  they're the ones that are insecure  and they're trying to show it  you know  so I'm very calm  but if there was a problem  you'd be glad I was here  you feel me  you know  I got that other side  but people always say that  well you're not mean  I'm like well you're not my enemy  right  yeah  why should you be  right  I gotta breathe  and like Coco said  I got Coco  what I got to be mad about  right  yeah  Coco you have a picture 
[01:56:00]  taken down recently  on twit pic  this girl  this girl  this girl knows  this girl  Coco knows how to use Twitter  yeah  her twit pics are ridiculous  yeah  what was the photo  they took down  well just recently  I balanced a can on my butt  and it was in a thong  because you know  on my  you know  if you follow me  on my Twitter  I do thong Thursdays  at Coco's World  and Titty Tuesdays  so you get both T and A  if you're not into asses  then you're gonna be in boobs  either or  you know  you're like damn  I gotta wait a couple of days

[01:58:00]  see the story  goes  family values  Wednesday night  so it's Wednesday night  and I go  geez mom  we're eating pizza  on the counter  geez  I don't have  thong Thursday picture  I don't know  what I'm gonna do  you know  I try to be funny  and she's like  she's like  oh well  you know  I'll get a camera  I'll take the picture  and I'm like  well I want to do  something funny  I look around the room  I look down  I see  a Sprite can  I was like  let me try to  balance this  on my ass  I've never tried it before  people have asked me  to do it  but I've never tried it before 
[01:58:30]  so I slot it down  she got the camera  yeah  and I actually  can do it  now it's a trend  now every world  TMZ  picked up on that  and everybody  all girls are now  trying to balance  trying to balance  on their ass  we're doing TV interviews  and people are like  well do you think  the co-girl would  balance the can  no no  dumbass  no  that was his  one night  her and her mother  is stupid  I never saw that photo  not that I'm really  hoping we could see it  I'm going to put it back up  I got a new  who say page  if you guys know  what a who say page  it's just for celebrities  and athletes 
[01:59:00]  who can actually put  anything they want  on  yeah  up on there  oh wow  that's handy  so I'm going to  repost it soon  it's a famous picture  I think so far  that's been your most famous  why can't we do it today  I know  I'm not wearing  the right stuff  we have someone  that works for the show  that loves Coco's ass  I'm going to guess  it's either Danny or Mars  oh yeah  oh there go to picture  oh there it is  oh shit  there it is  it's on television  wait where is it  where did I come in  that's Apple TV 
[01:59:30]  that's CNN  oh Apple TV  it's a national  it's a national situation  it is  Apple TV  it's Apple TV  we just pop it up for you  Travis is amazing  Danny and Mars  especially love Coco's ass  holy shit  I've never looked  because she's a married woman  but I'm here  it's very lovely  none of us are complaining about it  trust me  but Danny and Mars  especially love it  can't get enough  that is a nice get up  Coco your ass  wow  and that's not showing too much  honestly guys  I mean  they shouldn't have taken that down 
[02:00:00]  I gotta tell you  your ass  is afraid of booty  your ass comes up in discussion  a lot on the show  really  as the go to ass  it's funny  we got together  a lot of women  are like  she has a fake ass  I'm like  fake ass  we never even heard  of fake ass  she's like  I got breast implants  that's cool  but a fake butt  and you know  I told her  I said  well just take that  as a compliment  they just look at it  like it's impossible  it could be real  but it's real  I would have blown out 
[02:00:30]  any type of  anything that was  fake  and I'm a brother  I mean  I could go with the booze  but I need real meat  can we talk about  the fake ass  for a second  is that possible  wouldn't it be a pain  in the neck  to sit the fuck down  people are actually doing it  I've actually seen it  touched it  and everything  is it uncomfortable  to sit down  well that's the thing  okay I might be a hypocrite  when I say this  but yes  I got my boobs  enhanced  at 18 years old  I'm against  the button plants  and people go 
[02:01:00]  well you did that  why would you be  against that  but seriously  think about it  I'm not sitting  on my chest  it's like  your butt  is the main key  on your body  you're constantly  doing something  with your legs  and I've seen  a lot go wrong  I've seen one droop down  yeah it doesn't seem  like it could be  as natural looking  but they got  the implants  and now  they got the shots  or whatever  it's just  it's nasty  they're creepy looking  they really  they don't look  there's something  off about them  I mean what I say  you don't bang  I mean you don't  I don't  you know  bang your boobs 
[02:01:30]  I bang your ass  you know what I'm saying  now it's good to have  some meat back there  because I don't want  to break a pelvis  of anything  when I'm in motion  some padding  right  right  something tells me  iced tea is an animal  I'm a man  oh yeah  are we going to it  pair that shit up  yeah  well we have this thing  we have this thing  that people have been  asking us  how we keep our  relationship together  and we have this thing  that we call the sexual code  okay  and I think every man  every woman  has a sexual code  now the code is 
[02:02:00]  whatever it takes  to turn you  the fuck on  okay  it might means  you might need to see  a girl in a wetsuit  and figure skates  I don't know  what the code is  the question is  are you willing  to tell the code  and are they  tell the code  and are they willing  to accommodate  the code  and we all have a code  you know  and the thing of it  is usually  when you're just dating  you're afraid  to tell the code  because it might be  a little too kinky  right right  but once you  understand the code  it's going to be good  and it could be  a bunch of codes 
[02:02:30]  it could be a bunch of codes  it could be  a long list of codes  could you give us  one of your codes  I like when I'm having  sex with a girl  and she talks about  how she's fucked guys  who are better fucks  than I am  and have bigger dicks  than I do  and that turns you  to fuck off  well it's just such an easy  it's such an easy thing  to find  but yeah  I like the humiliation  of it  because I'm so jaded  after all these years  of porn  it's like  I'm so numb  I like two girls 
[02:03:00]  but I would rather hear  about her telling me  how she would rather  be fucking somebody  other than me  because that's taboo  and that just makes you  explode  that  the three way orgasm  where you fart  and you come  and you get a headache  if she says it right  it becomes the four way  because I shit as well  I talked about  the three way  one time on twitter  and people were like  are you what  I had a way  and some people  was like  man I know  what that one is  when you really  think you're gonna die 
[02:03:30]  when you're extremely  you're like  I love you  another code  some gasket's  gonna blow  somewhere  right  toes are about  things pop off  like rockets  today is code Friday  I like  I like  if body scent is good  I like no deodorant  I like a little smell  under the arms  that can be very sexy  see look  I think you might have  hit one of Coco's toes  I don't need deodorant  as long as the chemistry  is good  the body chemistry  that's nature  telling you  that you should be  or you shouldn't be  I give up one of my codes 
[02:04:00]  I go into stalker mode  right before we get home  so like  right before we get ready  to come in  we've been out all night  then I'll say  walk in front of me  she walks  I let her open the door  he wants to be  like he doesn't know me  I want to be behind her  and follow her  into the house  and kind of like  you know  because you got to think  when you're with your girl  all night  you don't really get to see her  because she's right with you  everyone else  gets to admire her  so I'm like  just walk ahead  and you walk into the door  and then I come through the door  and I'm evil Mick  you know  I'm that guy

[02:09:00]  yeah  good seeing that  just a minute  ladies and gentlemen  I think something  is happening  this is the worst  of Opie and Anthony  Sirius XM  this is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony  show  you guys suck  Sirius XM  so Andy Levy  last night  I was checking out  his Twitter  it's Andy Levy  TV's Andy Levy  on Twitter  Andy Levy  yeah  and he tweeted  this fucking video  and it's called  the name of it  sucks a dick 
[02:09:30]  it's Del Dot  removes basketball hoop  Delaware online news video  is the name of the  fucking video  I think it  it's doing well  so I guess  what do I know  it's the Delaware  Department of Transportation  Del Dot  Del Dot  God what assholes  wait till you see this  Jimmy  so the set up  is very easy  this guy  is doing  an interview  with the news  I guess  some asshole  in the neighborhood  has decided  that basketball  hoops need to be  removed from the  neighborhood  and this guy  has been fighting  his basketball hoop 
[02:10:00]  being removed  from the neighborhood  for a little while  it seems like  yeah he's sending  appropriate letters  you hear about  in this story  and now he's  doing an interview  about you know  what's going on  and it's key  to the story  I think he says  that the hoop's  been in place  for 60 years  in front of his house  so obviously  probably before  he was even  fucking bored  because he doesn't  look like a 60  year old man  it's been there  forever  and I think also  pertinent to the  story is the fact  that the news  was there  interviewing him  because the 
[02:10:30]  DOT had come  there previously  to remove the  basketball hoop  but this guy's  wife crawled up  and sat on top  of the hoop  so they couldn't  remove it  so the news  I guess thought  that was kind  of a newsworthy  thing  sent a crew  down there  to interview  this guy  and in the  middle of the  interview  the DOT  shows up again  with police  fucking assholes  yeah we'll stop it  so we can film  the place  this is annoying  me already  the country's  supposed to be  broke  and this is  what they're  wasting their  money on  that's what  Ann said earlier  yeah they're  wasting their 
[02:11:00]  money on this  and what really  comes into play  in this  is the fact  and we've  talked about  this so many  times  the fact that  you don't own  fucking shit  you think you  own your house  you think you  can do whatever  you want on  your own  fucking property  no you don't  own shit  you want to do  anything  you need to  fucking grease  a representative  so you get  a permit  and fucking  pay through  the nose  so they  can get  their cut  on everything  you do  it's  mobster  tactics  and they're  they're  permit crazy  we've been 
[02:11:30]  talking about  this off and  on for last  year  everything you do  in your house  you need a  fucking permit  for  how is this  now my  property  my house  I pay  a fuckload  of taxes  on it  yet I'm not  allowed to  fucking put a  hoop on there  or build an  addition or change  a room or remove  a tree or put  in a pool or put  up a fence or  a sidewalk or  I go through a  million fucking  things change the  roof color  so you need a  permit to put up  a fence you need  a permit to take  a tree down you  need a permit to  use the parks now  on Long Island  yes  permit permit permit 
[02:12:00]  permit permit  nothing but permits  everywhere  when I went to  put my  what the fuck  are they doing  when I went to  get my backyard  done my backyard  was when I  moved in it was  mud flat grass  it was just mud  mud all around it  I remember those  days just a muddy  grassy mud  it was just flat  it had grass on  it that was it  I'm like you  know what I  want because  yeah because  I'm an American  I've achieved a  certain place in  my life that I'm  very happy with  I want a pool 
[02:12:30]  I want a fence  around my yard  to keep the  riffraff out  I want a pool  house and I  want certain other  things maybe a  built-in barbecue  I want everything  so now some  trees have to be  removed things  have to be brought  in holes have to  be dug pools  pool parts all  that shit the  amount of permits  that I had to  get to do this  was astounding  probably no less  I'll say more no 
[02:13:00]  less than a dozen  permits come on  all of them just  to money just to  time just to redo  your backyard just  to put in what I  wanted to put in on  my own fucking  property that I'm  paying for name  name the permits I  don't believe you  permit a dozen  how about just a  pool permit to  have the pool  that's one  that's one  then every aspect  of the pool needs  to be inspected  and you've got to  pay the inspector  and he's got to  sign off on it  plumbing the  wiring the  cement work  proper drainage 
[02:13:30]  you need a sump  type thing just in  case something  happens then  there's the fence  they only allow a  three-foot fence in  my neighborhood to  get a six-foot fence  or a four-foot fence  to get a six-foot fence  you need a variance  why the why the  what this shit  drives me nuts  yes yes what's  the difference between  a four-foot and a  six-foot fence  oh costello and  abbott  what is the difference 
[02:14:00]  uh two feet  no the difference  oh the difference  is being literal  the difference is  simple  yeah they if you  want the six-foot  which most people  obviously would want  pay more pay more  you know you're  gonna have to pay  more tree removal  now there were  trees in the way  of getting this  pool and fence  installed yeah  to remove every  tree you need a  permit for the  tree the pool  house an external  structure on your  property now you  need a guy to come  out and assess the  distance between so  now you need a  survey done on your 
[02:14:30]  property line you  have to pay for all  this by the way this  isn't supplied by  you gotta stop you  gotta stop the survey  no no you asked  i'm having a survey  i'm out of my mind  and survey your  property and make  sure the uh extra  this uh non-attached  structure on your  house the pool house  is within uh your  property the proper uh  uh leg can't be close  enough to the fence  the pool why can't be  close enough why what's  my fucking property i  should be able to tuck  it right against the  fence right yeah why  nope sorry the fence is  supposed to protect uh  from uh your kids and 
[02:15:00]  stuff jump you know  jumping in the pool  sorry all right now the  pool's gonna take up more  electricity and shit like  that so i had to put new  service in uh 240 service  had to go in now the  electrical inspector has  to come by and inspect  the electricity and the  wiring and make sure  everything's up to code  and now bam more cash is  coming out of my pocket  i'm sweating that  motherfucker how about  your barbecue you want to  build a brick standing  barbecue that isn't  something you wheel out  and stuff that's a  permanent structure why  you need an inspector to  come why because they  need their money why to 
[02:15:30]  claim that they're  fucking broke why if like  if you're just wheeling a  barbecue out in your  backyard that's way more  dangerous than if you  actually build a nice  structure there you go  with cement and bricks all  around and now the fence  by the way oh wait i  brought up the fence  already didn't i oh how  about the guy that's got  to come over and make  sure your fence is safe  and there are alarms on  every entrance from  outside to inside the  area with the pool so if  some little toddler opens  it up it goes meh meh  meh meh you have to pay 
[02:16:00]  a guy for that a guy has  to inspect that to make  sure it's there so why do  you have to pay the  inspector because no one  else is i pay him and he  probably gets a paycheck  why why probably gets a  paycheck not on the state  or the county that i'm  paying my taxes yeah if  we're paying our taxes  then that should just go  with it that it's the  inspector comes out and  fucking make sure it's  all up on the up and  up are you paying extra  this shit is driving me  nuts and this is just to  have the all-american  backyard that i wanted on  my own property you would 
[02:16:30]  think i went to a neighbor  and just started doing work  in his yard sure and  people like hey hey what  are you doing obviously  you got a lot more going  on in your backyard than  the average person you  know what i like not  really i like bringing it  back to the average guy  not really most of that  stuff the average guy has  to deal with if a guy  wants a pool you don't  have to be fucking a rich  guy to get a pool i know a  lot of people when i was  working that also worked  and had pools and they  have to go through the  same thing if you want to  play down anything a  sidewalk this change  something these have to be 
[02:17:00]  inspected who started this  who fucking started it and  again we're a representative  government no who was the  representative that that  suggested this that was  voted into office that  everybody said now this is  why i put him in here so we  could be fucking extorted like  the mob can extort us to to  do things uh around our own  house i'm doing i'm doing my  breathing exercises yeah do it  i'm doing my breathing  exercise i have a question  by the way i apologize for  taking off tomorrow uh  yesterday i took a day off 
[02:17:30]  and uh you're back i sent i  do have a twin cousin you're  back that's very mellow yeah  it looked like you he i know  he did he came in we've been  like our looks are impeccably  identical well we were calling  him anthony what's his name  yeah his name's pete pete so  we'll know for next time pete  come here he came in and i was  listening to the show a little  bit yeah don't you have an  uncle pete it's always pete  oh shit and i'm in trouble  with the mob and he was  embarrassing to listen to  he was because the things he 
[02:18:00]  was saying i was like listening  to the obama speech and he was  like oh i don't care and i'm  just like god i'm ready to go  crazy on the guy i kind of like  i kind of like the i hate pete  come back what an asshole he's  a fag i like the pete guy oh  slow down with the fag thing but  i like the pete guy no there's  something else wanted oh so what  do you think local government they  all get together at the where  at uh what do they call a little  town hall the town hall and  they what are they just bored so  they just make up shit to bother 
[02:18:30]  us yeah yes is that what it's  coming down to it's another  version look down the hallways  here it's another version of just  justifying your job like hey i'm  an inspector i gotta inspect right  what can i what can i add to my  schedule of inspecting and then if  something isn't right and they  don't want to work either by the  way no one wants to work now most  people don't want to work no but  there's an incentive because they're  getting a little uh little action  because you have to pay the guy to  come out with the guy you got to pay  the guy and god forbid something 
[02:19:00]  isn't up to code because of some  reason and you have to change  something oh then the fine you have  to change it ridiculous there's no  fine yet but he'll go all right you  change that i'll be back in a  couple of days and then you pay him  again you have to pay him for the  second you gotta pay and the amount  of oh here's another thing the  amount of paperwork to get the  permits in the first place cost you  money and you got to fill out things  that are ridiculous here's an  example i mean i have a tree it's  your your tree it's it's dying it's  a dying tree i want to have it i have 
[02:19:30]  to have it removed or this thing's  going to fall onto my house so at some  point so let me slow you down if it  falls down on your house then what  happens i guess the insurance  companies got paid town isn't  fucking responsible fucking sue the  town you could but you know what  that's gonna take no why because i  know where you're going with this so  you tell those fuckers look i  couldn't afford to take the tree  down so i had to keep it up and now  it fell on my property so now i'm  suing you as they see me sitting  with pina coladas in my jacuzzi i  can't afford to have this tree  removed well but bring it back to  the average guy i'm sure i'm sure the  situations where the average guy has 
[02:20:00]  a dead tree and he can't afford to  get a situation got nothing to do  it so let the fucking tree fall on  your house and then sue the sue the  county yeah and go look i couldn't  afford to take this away so i took my  chances they would say like hey it's  your property that's when they go  hey it's your property now it's your  property because now you're gonna  pay somebody uh the the county uh all  sorts of fees and shit to remove the  fucking tree none at all all right go  back to this i was going through this  form with keith that you have to fill 
[02:20:30]  out in order to have a tree on your  own fucking property removed and not  just any tree this tree's dying and  shit uh the the questions is the tree  sick is the tree um posing a danger  um uh how big is the tree please  measure the tree around from the ground  four feet up give us the diameter of  the tree and there's questions up the  ass and then you got to go down to to  uh uh the the town hall and file this 
[02:21:00]  form with money of course everything is  money and then an inspector now comes  out and inspects the tree to make sure  it's you know ill-fated it doesn't  doesn't interfere with your neighbors  in any way do you have to pay the  inspector oh yeah i'm out of my mind  again i'm serious and now i gotta pay  the people that that cut the tree down  right obviously that's got to be paid  but i don't mind that because that's  what i'm having them do right but it's  the lead-up to that and i'll have a  lot of fucking firewood next year  because that's a big guy how much 
[02:21:30]  fucking tree how much money is it  going to cost you before the company  comes in and takes the tree it's at  least because that's something you  expect probably i'll tell you before  anything before that tree gets touched  about two grand now yes there's no  fucking yes there's no fucking filing  fees inspection fees there's no tree  who can afford that besides you a  fucking arborist i have to hire an  arborist to come up and inspect the tree  to make sure there isn't some kind of 
[02:22:00]  fucking it's not a an endangered tree  it's not a home to a fucking spotted  owl it's not no shit an arbor i'd  rather hire an arsonist and burn the  tree down sounds like arborist it does  it's not funny but it sounds like  arborist excellent point yes all good  points aren't funny that was just very  valid well not at all yes that one  just happened to lack humor in every  way shape or form something i should  just hire jill burn it it's very funny 
[02:22:30]  holy shit yeah holy shit or call an  abortionist they're saying or how about  an abolitionist  an abolitionist oh get rid of him too  oh christ on a pony i can't take it  anymore holy shit yeah you got to be  kidding me  dude this tree is just retarded how is  it how is this happening yeah and i got to  deal with a neighbor but the neighbor's  been pretty cool like keith has been over 
[02:23:00]  there and talked to him because there's  no way a truck can get in on my side of  the property because of the fence and  everything like that and my backyard's  all done it's got gates and everything  and his my neighbor's driveway is like  right next to the fence and that tree  right right so i think the tree cutting  company is gonna have to go into his  driveway and stuff i'll grease him i  don't care you know you pay off a neighbor  well i won't i don't have to but i'll  throw him a few bucks for the convenience  i wouldn't take it if i was a neighbor  i'd just be neighborly  it's cool i don't mind things like that  that's kind of just like 500 bucks no i 
[02:23:30]  was thinking a couple hundred all right  i thought just for fucking i thought  200 just a couple hundred you know  there's gonna be a truck in his  fucking driveway it could be  inconvenient for a while so here yeah  and if he doesn't take it that'll be  cool he never you know i never offered  it or for once for once it's nice to be  your neighbor yeah most of the time  he's probably like this fucking asshole  this guy now believe me during the  summer he's probably peeking over the  fence and enjoying the view what's  going on you can't let's girls in the  jacuzzi keep the trees a little low  for him so he can check shit out yes  oh that tree being removed by the 
[02:24:00]  way oh he's i think  leads a complete opening from one of  his upstairs windows into the jacuzzi  shit so he's in heaven he's gonna be  like yeah cut it down i don't care  yeah he's gonna show up with a fucking  hammer and a saw i'll be sure to help  i'll do it he's trying to pay me  is the fence thing this is was is the  fence thing where you can't have  something too close that we had a  problem with the neighbor years ago  because they built something too  close to our property and the  overhang was over our property and  then the squirrels were jumping into 
[02:24:30]  our tree from his fucking roof i  wonder if that's what it is all  these neighbor there is popped up  there is something like that  obviously if you have a structure  that's leaning over their property  line that's a problem and i can  agree with that problem but the thing  is then keep it after it happens or  something have the neighbor  complain then have somebody come  down whatever or or have a talk and  you say here's where it is or you  see it going up as a neighbor go like  hey that isn't that close and then  and then settle it i had to move my  pool drawings like they drew out where 
[02:25:00]  my pool was gonna go we submitted it  they said okay it's 10 feet off the  property line then they said no it's  got to be 20 feet why and then i was  like wait you said 10 fucking feet and  they're like no it's 20 feet and then  they came back and said 25 and i'm  like motherfucker i've got to draw this  pool where it's going to go on my  property whether it's going to be you  know perpendicular to a fence or  slightly askew or shit like that i got  to fit it in here if you have a fence 
[02:25:30]  why exactly just because they're yeah  they just want to bust your balls and  make a little extra money it's all  about the money it's all about fucking  them just shaking you down it's a  shakedown it's like a fucking a bad  cop going to a drug dealer and just  shaking him down because they can  because they the the the homeowner has  no recourse and where are you gonna go  they're all in it and there's a town  hall somewhere today where they're 
[02:26:00]  making up more shit to just bother you  cost you money right they get money and  then they cry poverty and raise your  taxes on the property you can't do  anything on right how are they crying  poverty on top of it so at least this  video that Andy Levy really really  kicked into high gear last yeah on his  Twitter just in case you're tuning in  we go back to this video you want to  explain it again and so you got the  what is it Department of Transportation  for Delaware right is going out and  just plucking basketball hoops off of  people's property they're close to the 
[02:26:30]  street because you know kids like  especially in cul-de-sacs like to play  basketball but the the net is is on the  property the people's property but  they're playing in the cul-de-sac the  the pole for years this shit basically  the poles on your property yeah or  maybe not because I think they have  some kind of fucking law where they  technically own three or four feet  yeah whatever that whatever that is  now that the actual hoop when you make  the basket the ball goes down on the  street and we all know this we all  grew up a million times they've been  around forever when no one's done this 
[02:27:00]  well they've been plucking these  things out the Department of  Transportation because they had  nothing better to do they were going  to pluck it out of the ground  seriously in front of this guy's  house but the guy's wife decided to  climb the pole and sit on it so she  obviously they couldn't remove it  who'd she call for advice Fonzie  hey she's getting a little carried  away too it's not exactly a fucking a  great a redwood cutting down lady I  hate them too you should change  yourself to it so but she was doing  that and then the news came down and  thought it was an interesting story was 
[02:27:30]  interviewing the husband right there  on in front of his property and then  he went oh here they come again and  the D.O.T. came with police this time  and it's the exchange between the guy  the police and the D.O.T. yeah the  female voice you're going to hear is  is a police woman yeah I'm not sure  she's just a cunt on wheels big and  this guy is making valid points and  she's blatantly lying to the guy really  I it's it's amazing to me the guy is  relatively young and he's got a cane in  his left hand so you know he's he's a 
[02:28:00]  maybe he's just classy did he have a  monocle yeah a top hat maybe he's  putting on a show in the driveway he's  a pretty pimpin he's a bit disabled so  here's the video the audio anyway it's  on our Facebook if you want to check it  out yeah my wife was dropping off my  daughter from school this morning and  coming back through Ashburn Hill she  saw about five or six Delta trucks big  ones Delta monster dump truck with a  couple basketball already having two 
[02:28:30]  basketball hoops in the back of it not  just the hoop by the way the entire  pole and everything or three guys to  every truck and assholes coming out  pulling basketball poles up but only a  specific eight picture with a truck  filled with the neighborhoods it's not  every basketball pole in the  neighborhood that would be quote unquote  in violation look at all it's a  specific eight and it's on one of our  neighbors at the end of the streets  route out of the neighborhood and he's  the one who made the anonymous complaint  that started this all back in September  some one neighbor burn him 60 years 
[02:29:00]  been there why all of a sudden did it  become a problem she saw the trucks  coming and they started pulling in down  the street and they started down at the  bottom so she said I'm going up the pole  right on man get me a cup of coffee  one jerk-off neighbor she should have  used some conditioner right yeah coffee  she's brought up a minute up here they  come here he is see now they're coming  back in the middle of the interview  this is beautiful with the cops you 
[02:29:30]  never get to see they're back how they  treat the average person I may have to  end this interview unfortunately I can  understand here it's the policewoman  unfortunately Delta has the right-of-way  they've sent out certified letters I  don't want to but we have we have  responded back to those letters myself  and my state representative and we have  not gotten responses to our responses to  them so we felt this matter was still  pending and for them to come out here  and ambush us at 8 3rd 8 15 in the  morning and start stealing basketball 
[02:30:00]  polls is not right here so I'm going to  tell you right now okay can I have two  hours to get my TRO filed  no you may not why the car needs to be  moved right now my car I do not want to  arrest you or your wife arrest you can  pause that a minute  there there is a threat of arrest right  now over a basketball over basketball  who for this guy that is just trying to  give his side of the view he's not in  any way being violent right he's not in 
[02:30:30]  any way being on it he's not trying to  incite her into anything he's just  discussing this and she immediately goes  with the arrest threat over a fucking  hoop that's on his goddamn property I  don't know I don't hate her though not  yet oh you'll hear okay at this moment  okay you'll hear yeah not yet okay I  guess technically you could say she's  doing her job right yeah right now she's  going don't go up in the thing but  there's no fucking reason to even that  the police are involved is astounding and  the fact that it's not it hasn't been 
[02:31:00]  fully gone through whatever process is  kind of annoying yeah well it shouldn't  even be a process just leave the fucking  basketball hoops alone and go figure  something but he's filed papers and  everything and and what there can't be  an injunction with of a removal until  this is done I mean if you want to take  the whole legal aspect that this hoop  legally doesn't belong here and we're  ripping them out well then as an  American you should be able to refute  that with legal paperwork and and and  using your representatives and you know  hash this thing out and get some kind 
[02:31:30]  of injunction but they don't want to  hear it it's not in there no fuck you  we're taking you really are just yelling  into a room by yourself with stuff like  no one is listening no one can listen  because they're all in it the people  that are supposed to be listening are in  on it this is what we want our local  governments doing though right we're  going around neighborhoods and pulling  out fucking yeah that's it hoops  really how about are you fucking  kidding me I wonder how many people  are playing basketball in these hoops  because they don't have fucking jobs  what scumbag what scumbag anonymous 
[02:32:00]  neighborhood anonymous complaints  can you just picture the person in your  head we can all relate to that I can  picture who that is in my head cowards  old neighborhood torches and pitchforks  and old school all right so back to  this so oh by the way so you know  because it's a visual obviously like I  said the videos on our Facebook page  but uh the the van the minivan is right  under the hoop yeah he trying to protect  the hoop right and then that's what she  said move the fucking car I want to  arrest you or your wife but that is  where this is gone the car needs to be 
[02:32:30]  moved she'll be up that bull again in  two seconds she will not be up that  bull again okay why not gonna because  we're not going to allow her it's  disorderly conduct if anybody goes up  the pole this harm only am i still  going to be allowed to keep my pole  they're not taking the pole putting  them they've asked me what I would like  my call yes because that's not what I  saw and my neighbors didn't tell me  that the law is supposed to take it but  they offer you the courtesy of letting 
[02:33:00]  you keep it the curtain you may stand  here you may not you may not talk to  them she said taunt them  oh did she can you pause that because  it's worth and you got to go back he  starts screaming in the background march  sadness and march sadness and that's  pretty good you can barely hear it march  sadness take off obviously our march  madness he's calling it march sadness and by  the way and what you see is a fucking  what what is that a front loader with 
[02:33:30]  the yeah yeah big front loader big  front loader is about to just rip the  hoop out of the ground yeah who is the  fucking who is the fucking asshole in  this it's like these guys these dot guys  are hateable they're just doing it  there's someone told them to go do it  they don't get a fuck yeah someone told  these cops look there's a fucking  problem now you got to go protect the  dot workers you can't have this yeah so  they're doing what they're told but  there's somebody if you go up the chain  up the chain is the cunt is the prick  somebody is the the motherfucker who

[02:35:00]  history guys look at it and the thing  just falls down  there's a lying fuck right there she did  lie to his face it's on camera 
[02:35:30]  you could keep it yeah and then they're  loading it on the front loader where  they're going to put it in a dump truck  and he goes wait i want that in my  driveway yeah and like no you could come  pick it up or something and she says go in  the house and go it go in the house  fuck you go in the house fuck you is  right there ain't no reason for that  guy to go in his house he's standing  on his property voicing a complaint  against the civil fucking servant and  it's well within his fucking right no 
[02:36:00]  one likes you to object anymore people  now think that objection or even being  loud when you object is fucking cause  for arrest right on an airline you can't  object no they don't know the difference  between justifiably being pissed off and  object voicing your opinion and somebody  running yelling Allah Akbar the fucking  bomb to the chest really you don't know  the difference right I hope she's  catching some shit for this I in her  life I just hope that people are  recognizing her and going wow man I  wonder if she's a sub sexually she a  female cop a lot of a fucking dirty 
[02:36:30]  do you think she just said that to to  get the situation of course just like  you don't want to deal with the guy and  and said yeah well we're giving everybody  the option to keep the pole we'll lay it  in your driveway she didn't even say  giving everybody the option to keep the  pole and then end it right there where  it's like well we give you the option  but you got to come pick it up so she  said we'll lay it in your driveway say  that fucking lies there and why can't  they just lay it in the door fair enough  of the guy's exact property yeah exactly  she doesn't want the headache of it going 
[02:37:00]  back up but that's not her fucking place  yeah yeah if he puts it back up then so  be it then deal with it but leave the  fucking pole in his driveway it's his  property but they had to drag it away  why and they're all just taking it away  and they leave it to fall and bend and  then they dump it in a dump truck where  god knows that you know they're not  going to individually take it out that  fucking dump truck's gonna go and just  dump them all out at a junk pile what  do you think they're saving it in the  just in case you want to come pick up  your basketball hoop section of town  hall that's going to the dump 
[02:37:30]  motherfucker pile them all up in the  corner of the evidence locker back at the station  yeah and label each one with names on it  and go yeah they know that okay this is  the smith's uh uh pole yes and here mr  smith take your pole away she did  fucking that that she's lied she said  lied to him and she would put it in the  driveway and thank god it's on camera  because yeah you would go to the town  officials go look they lie to me and  they're and they'd be like yeah okay  she don't know i didn't say that there's  an edited part that uh they edited out  you're a fucking liar i hit it let's go 
[02:38:00]  let's get to the end of this we had the  option to keep in the pole  you can come and pick it up no you  didn't say that you said i can keep my  pole  your kids right now go in the house  go in the house real brave  go in the house we can stand out here  right  the wife  you just lied to me officer  you can talk to me  roll the tape back you know what you  just told me we can keep that thing  and now you lied  that's a great use of force and money 
[02:38:30]  power today  and i have the freedom to speak it's  the united states first amendment  rights to speak my will  they're filling the hole well they're  filling in the hole so a kid doesn't  trip in it and break his ankle and sue  them  and they're why look at this here's this  hoop here's 60 years they just  front loader  bam right into the dump truck  it's infuriating  it is annoying  that bitch did say you keep it  yep and then the truck goes away  with the the best there it is i think 
[02:39:00]  that's it there it is  fucking uh i love how the the the wife  said you make me sick  yeah and then the guy's like yeah i'm  i'm fucking i'm on my own property  i'll say what i want go in the house  what are you my mommy house  what are you my mommy  shitty delaware accent  fuck you  all over a dumb basketball hoop that's  been there forever not bothering  anyone and she said not bothering  they'll lay it in your driveway if you  want  yeah and he said yeah i want i i want  to keep that  now you could come pick it up  pick it up  she just wanted to she she was just 
[02:39:30]  saying whatever she had to say  it's james and lars to get out of  there  what looks like james and lars  it's not lars  it looks like  that's james  it's headfield  yeah they're probably on location  somewhere though  it's not lars i don't know the story  could possibly be on fox news  that's not lars  no no that's not lars  and it looked like him for a second  when i saw james  a big thank you to andy levy uh  bringing that  wow infuriating though  really a lot of people  god damn 
[02:40:00]  isn't that just drive you fucking  nuts  it's a great example of what's  going on in this fucking country  with the  with the local governments and uh  local government  state  federal  i mean it's  this is all it  just getting in your business for  no  fucking reason  we're in a fucking mommy state  this is a mommy state that we're  living in these days  you're not allowed to do anything  like jimmy said  you can't dissent anymore  without being labeled something  yeah  you used to be able to just talk  and speak your mind  and that was 
[02:40:30]  that was that  whether you got results from it or not  at least you were  it was open for debate and stuff  now  you're instantly slapped with one of these labels  you're difficult  it goes from  being difficult  to being a fucking terrorist  and everything in between  and nobody ever can make a snap decision  and go oh you know what that's a good point  right  it's like on the airline  when they charge me for that food  the fucking shit flight attendant  couldn't just go  ah you know what that is kind of shady  they didn't have the meal they're supposed to have for you  let's just do it the right thing  those fucking people couldn't go 
[02:41:00]  you know what the guy makes a good point  the cop couldn't go  you know what  all right he has this thing in motion  none of these fucking dumb robots  can just improv on the spot  and go you know what that's a great point  let's not do this  or let's put this on hold  and honestly  did that  and the guy said  he had paperwork in  he's working with a representative  did it really have to be ripped out  at that minute  no it didn't  right then  no  he asked for a little time  to get something filed  I guess 
[02:41:30]  like he was going through  a legal procedure  since he was notified  that this was going to happen  I would be even pissed off  if he wasn't going through  the legal  proper legal channel  absolutely  because it's crazy  but granted he was  it's even worse  that he was going through  all of the legal procedures  and they probably  put him off  put him off  and did it really have to be ripped out  at that minute  was it such a hazard  or whatever the fuck  they're calling it  that it had to be taken out  like that  it wasn't ticking  this thing wasn't ticking  and full of C4 
[02:42:00]  did we point out  it was at the end of a cul-de-sac  yes  it's in a cul-de-sac  it's a dead end basis  it's the same hoop  you've seen growing up  forever  a million fucking times  some cocksucker neighbor  why don't you hate your neighbors  oh fucking with those  god damn  who's complaining about the hoop  who cares  somebody that probably  didn't like the noise  yeah  tickle tickle tickle  I got a hoop  actually the neighbor  that I got to ask  if I could use his driveway  to get my tree out  he's got a hoop  and it's actually facing 
[02:42:30]  the fence and my yard  and every so often  during the summer  we're in the pool  the basketball just come  flying over the fence  and landing in the pool  and it's just the kids  and they're like  hey mister  can I have my ball  don't you love  when that happens  oh I love it  and then I get to play again  because I have to now  shoot the basketball  over the back of the hoop  and try to get it  into the fucking  I gotta shoot it over  the rear of the backstop  and get it in the hoop  and I've done it a few times  it's a lot of fun  that is fucking  I'm annoyed now  with that video 
[02:43:00]  I'm so annoyed  someone just sent me  another video  I'm trying to see  if there's more to it  she did  are you curious  about why the state police  would act this way  the internet has a theory  a theory  let me tell you  my theory  on Google Street View  go to Hillsdale  then just follow down  the street  until you reach  the dead end  so you can Google Earth  and get to the dead end  while we walk  did you ever wonder  how a neighbor  got so many state troopers  just to deal  with the basketball hoop  who could possibly  get such excellent service 
[02:43:30]  from the Delaware  state troopers  who was the complainer  I'm waiting for the next one  going down  judge smells  okay  I want these basketball hoops  taken down  I want them slapped  with an injunction  make their heads spin  yeah they're suspicious  that it took all  all those troopers  showed up for that  so maybe this person  that complained  is pretty powerful  who knows  sounds like a  conspiracy  this fucking video  has got legs man  oh yeah  this one's going to be  on the news 
[02:44:00]  it's got legs  and again  it just shows you  something also  the fact that  the news isn't  playing this right now  this will be like  eh Friday  probably  they'll hit it  and it'll be like  a news story  probably  meanwhile everybody  that is into  any kind of  social networking  social networking  is all over it already  the internet  you've seen it already  Andy has an update  Andy has an update  state police investigating  hoop incident  legislator works  to get basketball  pulled back  no Andy  Levy had an update  oh  they're conducting 
[02:44:30]  an internal investigation  into last week's  confrontation  between that family  and the trooper  which I guess  is the woman  well they have to  because it's on video  now it's on the news  that's one good thing  once it hits the news  then they have to  do something  just to shut everybody up  humna humna humna  whatever fucking asshole  probably made the decision  is now worried  they're going to look bad  so then they'll just  do something to clean it up  yeah  and then the news people  go we're very happy  we got the thing back  and our neighbor  was executed  oh we asked for our neighbor 
[02:45:00]  which we burned alive  with a stick in his ass  and he was  that was good  actually ironically  we tied him to a basketball  pole and burned him  the officer's flating us  does anyone know  why it's a problem  to begin with  something about a code  something we all grew up with  and was never really a problem  it's some code  it's called a free zone  that they have  in Delaware  where I guess  it's a public property  or city property  town property  and if it overhangs  that property  that it has to be removed 
[02:45:30]  so if the hoop  is overhanging a curb  as it would be  because you're playing  on the cul-de-sac  that is some type of problem  now why it's a problem  I don't know  because they were bored  at the town hall  and said look  we gotta make up more shit  and that's a made up reason  because some guy down the street  didn't like the  ka-chunk ka-chunk ka-chunk  of the basketball  hitting the street  kids playing  laughing  having fun perhaps  oh probably  this guy hates the kids  in the cul-de-sac  and said well 
[02:46:00]  this is a law  if I can get rid of that  fucking hoop  I'll have more peaceful existence  they knew who it was  that guy seemed to know  who it was  just fucking move  then  asshole  it's astounding  the whole lack  of freedoms  that we have  on our own property  what is supposed to be  our own houses  the ability  for  government  to come in  and use  you know  police and troopers  at the same time  to come in  and completely 
[02:46:30]  just  not acknowledge  your freedoms  under some guise  of some weird law  or statute  or fucking  just some ordinance  whatever the fuck it is  they have the power  to do anything  to transcend  your constitutional rights  and  do anything to you  but the other side  will say  well  they were breaking the law  exactly  and my point  is really simple  there shouldn't be a law  like that  there's other things  to worry about  before you start making laws 
[02:47:00]  about basketball hoops  at the end of a cul-de-sac  a law or a city  or town ordinance  can be whipped up  and you could be  held responsible  or arrested  or fined  for things  that should just be  you  enjoying  your life  liberty  and the pursuit  of happiness  in your own fucking home  but  those days  are gone  gone  someone noticed  I didn't notice  that  there are portable  basketball hoops  in the truck  so those  oh really  so those could have  very easily  been just  been moved  moved into a driveway 
[02:47:30]  right  the wheels  they fold up  actually  a little bit  right  yeah  I didn't even notice that  amazing  because that's  that's an easy one  and just  knock on the door  and go look  it's sort of  breaking a law  could you move  your fucking hoop  into the driveway  but no  why would you do that  unbelievable  the person who made  the complaint  was an 86 year old man  who doesn't like  the kids playing  in the street  that makes sense  you life hog  die  we are 86 years old  why don't you just  fucking  why don't you  get the DOT  to fucking 
[02:48:00]  dig a nice hole  and you crawl  into it face first  just die  I hate the kids too  so I would hate them too  running around  punks  probably would be  but what are you gonna do  you can't do anything  requiring the area  immediately next to the pavement  and subdivisions  to be free of obstructions  now that makes sense  if you're talking about  you know  if you want to build a shed  in front of your house  in the cul-de-sac  that would fall  under that free zone  requiring the area  immediately next to the pavement 
[02:48:30]  in the subdivisions  to be free of obstructions  but why do they have to make that  it's not an obstruction  they just  you could use any law  it's worded in a way  that they could use that  for anything  from even a car  parked on your street  right  but what else  was that meant for  besides basketball  probably the fact  that they don't want  any kind of permanent  or temporary structure  being built  in front of your house  that might  go into the roadway  but it does  a basketball hoop  technically might fall  into that 
[02:49:00]  but again  like Jimmy says  you should be able to  talk reasonably  with somebody  not make it such  a black  white  yes  no  issue  and say  oh it's a basketball  yeah you know what  those are fine  and then in the end  if you're going to take  the fucking thing  you'll put it in the driveway  like you told them you would  yeah  because it is there  yeah there's two problems  why do you feel like  you have to now  take it away  yeah  hauled it away  like the rest of them  so fucking  it really is irritating  then they took them all  and loaded them into  I heard they loaded them 
[02:49:30]  into boxcars  and drove them to a  basketball pole camp  where they're under  horrid conditions  you think they're  removing basketball  hoops in Harlem  I don't know  you think they go to  the black neighborhood  first they come for  your basketball hoops  and no one helped  that's right  and then in the end  when they came for  my basketball hoop  there was no one  left to help  where's that from  uh  holocaust  this is the worst  of the Opie Anthony show  Sirius XM 
[02:50:00]  what is going on  this is the worst  of the Opie Anthony show  Sirius XM  sometimes when we touch  you're on a steeze too much  you like that song Jimmy  it's lovely  that I have  yeah you like that one  fuck it my friend will start  he can really sing  yeah  he will belt that out  and it's so uncomfortable  I bet  because it's a guy  really singing it  yeah yeah yeah  sometimes when we touch 
[02:50:30]  you're like oh  is he good though  oh he's in a beat  yeah  he's hilarious  but he's  I was like god  you can sing  he goes while I sing  on the side  like in a cover band  yeah yeah  and he sings that one  but he means it  we are on a steeze  too much  and you realize  what a terrible song  that is  yeah yeah  yeah that is a horrible song  there it is  I think I might have found it  who did this song 
[02:51:00]  I don't know  Dan Hill  Dan Hill  it's just a very airy  groveling song  I'd rather hurt you honestly  than mislead you with  with a cry  I'm gonna croon it  who am I to judge you  when the words you say are true  or do or something 
[02:51:30]  I'm only just  the crooner  let's sing it like douchebags  the fucking puppies  doesn't cover this  oh yeah  I wanna hear that  sometimes I touch it  with a knife  whoa  the honest is  too much  and I have to close my eyes  this song used to make me sad  cause I was in love with a girl  in junior high  that didn't love me  and  and uh  and for no reason  you should have sang it  a treat for you  for no reason whatsoever 
[02:52:00]  I tied this song  to  how I felt about the girl  oh you fucking  make me sick  you know why it makes you sick  because you're thinking  of yourself too  faggot  please  babe  if I stick  this was my first song  with a girl  but I used to walk by  a girl's house  with an Iron Man  playing  I think I was cool  but no  it's because I know  the line is  when we both  you'd hold each other  and both break down  and cry  like you thought  you and the girl  were gonna hold each other  why couldn't we though  Jimmy  but uh  no  she didn't even know  who I was  and I don't know  why I equated this song 
[02:52:30]  to our non-existent  relationship  but she was  like when I saw her  this was the song  you would have both cried  her would she realize  what a drunk you are  and you wouldn't realize  you couldn't fuck  other girls anymore  you wanna hear about  Kim Jong-il  I found the list  it's terrific  sometimes when we touch  no it wasn't Dreamweaver  you asshole  oh  oh going to get Tom Papa  why do you have to go  get Tom Papa 
[02:53:00]  why don't we have a staff  we're still working  what happened  you're on air right now  it's Christmas  it's Christmas  no one's here  no one's here  can you imagine  other shows doing this  see you right back guys  I thought we were gonna  both break down and cry  thought I was gonna hold her  so the fear  in me  what kind of fear  did I have  being called a homo  for holding a doll  really  you should have sang that  that's true  break down and cry  when you fall in love 
[02:53:30]  for the first time  you do dumb shit  oh  it was just  it was  I used to  I used to like  open arms by  Jerry  and go listen to the words  this is our song  do you think  he described you  the lyrics  of course  you know what  when you fell in love  back in  in your  your teens  and stuff like that  in school  it was  it  it was  it was totally  all encompassing  every second  of the day  you couldn't do 
[02:54:00]  anything else  you couldn't do  anything else  but think about it  fucking  it was a plague  it was a blight  and it was something  that was fantastic  and horrible  horrifying  it was just  because then you would  think about it  ending or something  yes  and it would  but when you were  in it  it was like this  it was so much  more than it is  now  now it's just  what it is  you know  this is a good one  this is a good one  yeah  it's a good tune  do you come  with open arms 
[02:54:30]  no I cheat  no everything's closed  my phone is locked  open arms  locked phone  that's right  you couldn't do  your homework  you couldn't  fucking hang out  with your friends  anymore  you couldn't do shit  it was a constant  adrenaline rush  that you were  constantly getting  butterflies and whooshes  it was a nightmare  and then  there was too much  pressure  and that was when  you were just alone  thinking about it  right  then when you saw  the girl  oh forget it 
[02:55:00]  it was crazy  crazy  you looked like  such an idiot  I was a madman  you mean when you  were dating her  or when you just  liked her  no he's talking  about this  fucking  love  this junior high  high school  love shit  I was in love  where you thought  this was it  you would never  see another girl  in your life  I wouldn't even  look at it  like I would look  at other girls  and think  oh she's disgusting  compared to  you're so right  you couldn't even  see any other  good looking girls  no they weren't  good looking  no one else  was good looking  you couldn't even  acknowledge that  no 
[02:55:30]  and then they  fuck you over  and you try to  break your arm  in your garage  with a baseball bat  to garner sympathy  oh I forgot  oh  Jimmy  oh yeah  hi papa  yeah I literally  did that Jimmy  I know  it disgusts you  but I couldn't  I couldn't really  commit to it  so I just wound up  bruising my arm  I'm talking about  being in love  in like junior high  and the girl  broke up with me  and actually went out 
[02:56:00]  with one of my friends  so I went into the  garage with a baseball bat  tried to break my arm  to get sympathy  from her  like oh look  I have a broken arm  how would you break up  with me when I  now have a broken arm  so I took the bat  and would swing it  and I kind of  hold up  I bunt  I kept bunting  instead of swinging away  on my arm  that's your body's  own self defense  of course it is  like you wanna  keep going  my brain has called me an idiot  but my heart said  swing away  swing away  I couldn't really commit  no I couldn't commit  to the pain  I punched a brick wall  in Geneseo 
[02:56:30]  over and over again  to get the attention  of a girl  that didn't give a fuck  about me  you punched it  in front of her  no just  if I had like  kind of a broken hand  that somehow  that would make her  pay more attention  to me  yeah  I would pretend  that I was in a fight  I rode off  on my bike  and like  ripped my t-shirt  pulled the neck  ripped the t-shirt  how you pictured  someone had been  in a fight  with luck  messed my hair up  and came back  I was just in a fight  I was attacked  in the woods  by some guys  just looking at me  did she believe you  no 
[02:57:00]  I didn't look like  I was in a fight  I looked like  I woke up  I think my broken hand idea  would make me look tough  if I had a cast  and that would somehow  make her go  fuck  he's a real man  I'm the asshole  see we all have  the same dumb idea  that somehow  some physical thing  was going to make her  emotionally like you again  yeah  and it never worked  by the way  E-Rock has decided  to go with a  love soundtrack  in back  oh  of us  he's just picking songs now  yeah  no Tom 
[02:57:30]  but Anthony made a great point  and something I forgot about  of course I did  a long fucking time ago  when you fell in love  for the first time  basically like  junior high  high school  whenever the fuck  it happened  that real falling in love  for the first time  where you couldn't do  anything else  with your life  nothing  encompassing  nothing  you couldn't even  hang out with your family  you couldn't do shit  you would just sit around  waiting for the next time  you could either talk to her  or see her  you had no idea  what was happening to you  no nothing  you were just being swept  away by this  what the fuck  is this emotion  I'm in love 
[02:58:00]  I'm not going to see  my friends  my parents are going to be mad  because I'm not doing  anything I'm supposed  to be doing  I'm just obsessing  all over this girl  but we're saying  it was too much pressure  for a young kid  like that  yeah you're completely  out of your mind  you're completely  out of your mind  I was in 5th grade  and I fell in love  with Suzanne Moore  oh that's more  she was  she was freckly  and she was big  and I  all of a sudden  she was big  was she a fatty 
[02:58:30]  I had  no she was tall  she was kind of tall  oh tall girl  yeah  and I have a picture of it  literally  of me  all of a sudden  I went from being a kid  like in a t-shirt  to wearing a button down shirt  and I rolled up the sleeves  like just up to the arm  and then unbuttoned  like to mid chest  and I had like a little  communion necklace  that I had  I wore that  so the chain would be  like right in the V  of where my shirt was on  and I'm like  well get this 
[02:59:00]  very calculated  all of a sudden  I'm like  Don Watt  I really thought I was  like Saturday Night Fever  like John Travolta  John Travolta  yeah  yeah  you were like Travolta  but not in the ways  that you thought  you were like Travolta  on the steps of a plane  you know the photographer's looking  spitting a dude  to a close friend  but we used to  we used to go up  there's this little nature trail  and we used to go  walk down the nature trail  and make out  and it was so early  that we didn't even know 
[02:59:30]  what making out was  we would just smush  our faces together  didn't open a mouth at all  on TV  but all day  all night  I would wait  and think about  when we get back  on the nature trail  would your genitals  get funny  would they get a little funny  they got hilarious  they got hilarious  like what is going on  down there  that's exactly  there was this girl  named Donna  Donna Yonkey  spelled with a J  I think they were  from New Mexico  of course they were 
[03:00:00]  and they moved  to Central Islip  in the apartment complex  I lived in  and this girl  was  I guess the grade  lower than me  and I was in like  probably third grade  so this is really early on  and we used to go down  into the basement  of the apartment  and make out  which amounted to  like you said  closed mouth  just squishing lips together  and trying to move  your head around  and look like  Cary Grant  it's true  all you would do  is wiggle your head a little  wiggle your head  and then looking around  when you heard a sound 
[03:00:30]  hoping you know  somebody wasn't looking  and this bitch  this little fucking bitch  broke your heart  I wanted to  I wanted to keep doing this  because it was great  it made my genitals  feel funny  and then she started  going out with this  other kid down  Michael  started going down  with Michael  into the basement  I saw her and Michael  go down the steps  to the basement  one day  and I'm like  what the fuck  that was like  walking into a bedroom  and seeing your wife  with another man  at least she wasn't  going down with Leroy 
[03:01:00]  as a matter of fact  in the Central Islip  apartment buildings  there was one apartment  that was just  for black people  like all the other  apartment buildings  where white people  white people  white people  they put all the  black people  in one apartment  this is 1971  72 maybe  and yeah  if I saw her  go down those stairs  oh boy  good riddance  so heartbreaking  remember that empty  feeling though you had  when it fucking  fell apart  because that was 
[03:01:30]  a disaster  of an emotion too  how do you handle  that at a young age  I had to stand  at the bus stop  with them  and I'm like  fucking I got  my dumb school bag  and I'm looking at them  like you fucking  prick  it takes a little piece  of you away  forever  that was it  that was a little  chunk  taken away  of all the chunks  that have been  taken away  that made me  what I am  right now  as I fucking  sit here  a bitter man  she's the worst  being taken away  that's why you hate Obama  you know  ah yeah see  I was so  did he go to the 
[03:02:00]  basement with  Donnie Yonkey  he probably did  probably did  that was smooth  more importantly  how's the cookie Tom  you just had one  amazing  oh  it's really good  it's solid  not too dry  not too dry  it's a solid mom cookie  yeah it's a mom cookie  alright  it was  it's homemade  homemade mom cookies  from Sam's mom  well no I thought  they were like  deli store bought  and I was like  these are good  for like being  in a deli  that's great  yeah  I didn't know 
[03:02:30]  how to kiss a girl  so I asked Jill  I've told a story  in there before  but I was in  fourth grade  we were like  in the woods area  I'm like  I want to ask you  something  she's like  okay  I'm like  you know  what my favorite  band is right  oh that's right  every time I hear this  I fucking cringe  she just ignored me  she should have went  queen  maybe David Bowie 
[03:03:00]  what  oh shit  I don't know  how to ruin everything  oh my god  that's awesome  it's brutal  how humiliating  that's great  I remember when I first  got back  we would make out  and squish faces  and then  I just didn't know  what to do with my hands  and then I was like  I went up  I was holding her skin  like her back  oh yeah  yeah  crazy  and I went back  I was like  I think I got second  I think I got second 
[03:03:30]  back  my friends were like  you took off her bra  nah  you were picked off  at first  that's what happened  you were out thrown  you ran the wrong way  you ran to the un-deck circle  and spun around  but speaking of which  remember the pressure  of trying to get that  bra off casually  because it wasn't all  about like  I'm going to just  take your fucking bra off  it was like  you were trying to work it  8,000 steps forward  oh I understand  it was so much pressure 
[03:04:00]  you never saw one before  you had no idea  how it worked  and if she was a bit  big on top  there was a bunch of snaps  what was that about  yeah the first training bras  holy fuck  like chastity belts  it looks like those  final  it looks like that final place  they fasten the cables  on the Verrazano bridge  like that final  big block of cement  and you're there  with your little  nine year old hand  just trying to get those  nine foot diameter  bolts off  because you finally  get to an age  like we all know  what's going on here  let's just do this  but back then 
[03:04:30]  it was like  everything had to be  like fucking  undercover  and you knew  if it wasn't smooth  it was over  it would kill the whole thing  kill the mood  because she wanted  to make believe  it's just  you know  there's an oopsie  happening  right  maybe this will work  we had talked  also previously  about how square dancing  in gym class  was a sexual experience  in a way  because  you went to school  with these girls  all the time  you saw them  but you never  touched them at all  unless you know  you were going out  smooshing face  with one girl 
[03:05:00]  but these are just  the regular girls  you're with  and now you're  holding hands  like you're all  in the circle  so you're just  holding hands  with a girl  was like  and then I'm like  oh I don't want  Pam Bernfeld  could you move  could you move  because I want  that girl's hand  everybody was moving  around  everyone was jockeying  for positions  you know who the fuck  you were going to get  into the last second  but then when you're  doing the promenade  and you got your arm  around the girl  it was like  wow I'm touching  this girl  and you fucking  again you're just like 
[03:05:30]  ah you're freaking out  I want to go back  to the bra thing  again though  because another memory  so it's four snaps  four  you get the first one  done  you're like  alright  second one done  oh man  and if you ever  got to the fourth  where it just was unleashed  you're fucking  you would start  fucking foaming  well you get more  you get more  attention on each one  that you take off  so the last one's  got a lot of tension  holding it  but sometimes you  would only get  she'd allow  these girls were weird  sometimes they would  only allow you  to do one or two  and keep the other two 
[03:06:00]  freaking out  but if you got all  four off and that  thing went free  but if it went free  you still then had  to come back to the front  and try and go up  right and then  you could be stopped  there too  you could be stopped  there  it was a minefield  oh man was it  a minefield  that's why this was  the cure all for the  stuff  you got it  you got it  what happened  jeepers  you know what  my god damn  templates ripped  and by the way  old school 
[03:06:30]  by the way  you just dated  yourself  because Mr. Coffee  is like square  dancing in gym class  yeah we did  square dancing  did you square dance  in gym  yeah  back's box  well it probably  ended with this  whole PC shit  where like look  we can't have  fucking  you know girls  and boys  touching each  other  in class  because like  Anna said  in the past  that's like  having sex  when you're  11 12 years old  that's like  holy fuck  that's hardcore  sex 
[03:07:00]  could you imagine  being the teacher  like when all the  kids came back  from that class  all sweaty  and their eyes  big  oh man  boners  in everyone's  pants  pre-cum  in everybody's  trying to teach  them about  the Gettysburg  address  good luck  oh they had to  know  they were just  was no  what just  happened  the period  before  you're like  did that just  happen  was I  was I  basically  having sex  with that  that girl  it was like  Pavlov's dog  when you heard  the motor  that opened up  that accordion  door at the gym  and combine the 
[03:07:30]  girls and boys  side of the gym  you'd hear like  yeah you're just  freaking out  swinging from the  ropes  just in heat  sniffing crotches  imagine being the  girl that got  the first one  to get  ripped tits  before she  yeah  I mean think  about  the torture  that girl  went through  I remember  this girl  in 6th grade  we came back  from 5th to 6th grade  it was our last  year at  the elementary  school  in 6th grade  and she came 
[03:08:00]  back from  summer vacation  she was tall  and had big  tits  and that was it  you know  she was  the one  first name was  Jerry  holy fuck  and she was  big and  I was looking  at her tits  once and I  couldn't stop  and she  kicked me in  the nuts  just fucking  kicked me in  the balls  boy she  really had a  problem with  being the only  girl with giant  tits in there  there's always one  that had to  start it off  for the rest  of the gals  ours was  just a wreck 
[03:08:30]  of her face  like huge  buck teeth  and cocky  cock eyed  but the biggest  boobs we'd  ever seen  she was so  popular and so  hated all the  same  for us it was  so confusing  do I think  she's pretty  well we're  gonna bring her  in now Tom  let's get her  in here  oh she's a  babe now  we had a  girl 34  days she wore  an army t-shirt  no bra  it drove  everyone  insane  oh my god  in school 
[03:09:00]  yes  in school  crazy  the power  what was she  allowed to  even come to  who sucked  them  they would  just bounce  across the  cafeteria  and we'd  all lose  our fucking  minds  did anybody  get to suck  them  like anything  suck  unfortunately  I wasn't  in that  circle  you know  google plus  everyone  I wasn't  in that  one  wasn't in  the tit  sucking  circle  unfortunately  she was  like she  might as  well have  been 28  really  she was  so unobtainable 
[03:09:30]  it was so  hard  most of us  I think  she was  already  dating  college  guys  as a  15 year  old  one of  those  girls  you know  why  it was  so hard  to find  a place  to do  anything  sexually  with girls  in school  like where  where are  you going  yeah like  when jimmy  said the  woods  it's like  if you  could find  some woods  you win for it  fucking woods  old fields  animals  to the woods  let's go to the woods  I'm me  a tree fork  dude I'll go  local  old fields  junior high  they had that  little pond  I don't know  if it's still  there  and during  lunch period 
[03:10:00]  if you were  brave  you went  and took  the walk  around the  pond  smoking  cigarettes  smoking  pot  and people  making out  which was  like hardcore  sex  I got a  brace faced  blowjob  at Lahey  across the street  from Oldfields  this is last week  oh no  I think Lahey  was  Harborfields  Lahey was  right across  from Harborfields  yeah  no Oldfields  had this pond  and the teachers  would go back  every once in a while  but there was  all sorts of  you know  there was a system 
[03:10:30]  set up to make  sure everyone  knows the teachers  are coming  I went to  Blydenberg Park  once  and this was  during like  high school  Blydenberg Park  and they were  having a Girl Scout  Jamboree thing  there  and I knew  a couple  of the girls  that were Girl Scouts  so I went  into their tent  I totally snuck in  went into their tent  and they're hanging out  in their panties  and t-shirts  and I'm in there  and they were like  playing cards  and stuff  and I just thought  this was great  and then the  one of the  camp fucking  head camp leader 
[03:11:00]  things  were checking  on the tents  I had to  lay down  in the corner  of the tent  while these girls  four girls  sat on me  to cover me up  and like  folded their  legs  and I just  sat there  with four  Girl Scouts  wearing panties  sitting on me  like a chair  it was  I was like  I wish  she would never  leave  this moment  would never  end  it was amazing  you popped  your own tent  meanwhile 
[03:11:30]  they're in the  fucking tent  they've had  little period  smells  a few dumps  that were  wiped  but not  showered  Jimmy always  has to ruin  it  that doesn't  ruin it  it was great  Dan always  had game  though  I was staring  at underoos  that is pretty hot  I bet you the  counselor came in  and saw you  and just jerked  off to what a  lucky devil you are  it was a different  time  there were those  moments  we used to go to  a cabin upstate  too with these  girls  and it was  another place  where you could  actually have sex 
[03:12:00]  close to the woods  another woods  thing  and it was  one of those  things  you couldn't  sleep  you didn't  want to  sleep  because that  was wasting  fucking valuable  time of being  in the same  bed or sleeping  bag with a  naked girl  it was close  and you just  the second I saw  the sky turn  that bluish  color and you  hear birds chirp  and I'm like  fuck man  it's over  you're gonna have  to get up  this sucks  those were the  ones you just  wanted  that was it  you could die  right there  and be  completely happy  if you were 
[03:12:30]  15 and dead  and think about  that  like that  memory is  so burned  in there  and all the  girls that  you've been  with since  then you  don't even  remember  but those  early ones  are so  pokey  because you  really had to  work it  and it was a  new part of your  brain opening up  you're just like  what is this  shit  you never felt  that before  and everything  you accomplished  was science  everything you  accomplished  every step  forward was  just huge  huge  all fodder to  tell your  friends  oh my god  yeah  jeez louise 
[03:13:00]  i was getting  put to you  all the time  i fuck like  30 girls a  year  jim i'm so  green with envy  about that  sticking it in  all the holes  getting them  creamy down  there  how old  how old  were you  the time  i was like  four i was  getting them  creamy  sticking it  in  climb on  and just  pound it  until it  was like  melba toast  or those  cookies  it doesn't 
[03:13:30]  sound  adorable  we should  probably break  now  chip doesn't  put a good  spin on  it ruins  everything  i just got  a lot of  puss  it was such  nice memories  until you  chirped up  were you guys  lame when you  talked about it  too like  we used to go  did he get  patched last  night  you said that  i'm throwing  myself under  the bus  he blew up  pirated  they rented a  robin williams  movie  it was so  fucking lame  we were the  nerds of high  school  did he get  patched last  night 
[03:14:00]  i was getting  shit so it's  like if you  got patched  it was a big  deal and you  tell your  friends i got  patched  you were  chipped and  you didn't  even know  it  i know  i know  i got lots  of patch  yeah  so many  patches  you're like  a pack  factory  a parrot  and a  heavy  petting  and stuff  most of the  girls especially  harbor field  supposedly had the  reputation they  didn't go all  the way so if you  got patched it was a  big fucking deal  i wouldn't have  said that at my  awful times  you'd be offended by 
[03:14:30]  that  i didn't say it to be  cool  i'm embarrassed  how old were you  saying that  16  i was uh  i was a late  bloomer  i didn't uh  mature until  my senior year of  high school  really the girls  didn't come around  into girls  i did well  because i the  10th graders  because i was  more on their  level  i was a senior  right  girls my own age  now fuck no man  and no junior high  stuff or  a little bit  i was always like  so small for my 
[03:15:00]  age  right  i don't think i  had pubic hair  until i was like  17  you were almost  17  it must have been  nice and calming  like to go through  junior high and not  yeah i didn't be  losing it yet  i didn't lose my  virginity until i was  18  i literally last night  had a dinner with  all these like high  school junior high high  school people it's like  10 of us and we see  them every year and  it's all the girls that  we started with it's all

[03:16:00]  how can i get them  back how can i get the  back to the woods  how can i get into  the woods  why there's some  woods around  it's things you  you thought you  forgot about when i  used to still go to  high school reunions  you go back and you  get right back to that  mindset and all these  memories come back like  oh yeah he liked her  they're still working in  this and that and you  realize you're not  really that much older  than when you left  nah not really same  shit nah did your  wife go with you and  their spouses no no  spouses allowed hey  oh that means you  guys so it's it's  literally you and your  guy friends me it

[03:17:00]  showing up and now  it's now this is this  is the this is the  plot now and I'm  gonna I'll probably  blow it but in high  school we one time  rented this beach  house like this we're  all at this beach  house somehow maybe  someone's parents or  something and it was  just one of those  times where we were  all kind of screwing  around just we just  lost our minds it  was like everybody  was all of a sudden  like making out with  people you never even  liked before  literally last night a  plan was hatched that 
[03:17:30]  we should we should  tell the guys should  tell the their wives  that they're going on  a guys weekend the  girls go off on a  girls weekend and we  just happen to be in  the same house don't  tell the spouses just  go away all of a  sudden recreate that  thing oh man the  pictures on Facebook  everyone taking the  same kitchen photos  and the girls would  probably go what  we're not doing that  you assholes we  fucking I jerked you  off in 1978  get over it  you're one of many  yeah I enjoy having a

[03:21:00]  they were arguing  about  politics  and Nick said  that  Obama was only in  because of white guilt  and  Louis C.K.  made a Nazi reference  and Nick got mad  and said  look my dad  fought the Nazis  don't  you know  don't call me a Nazi  and Louis C.K.  said okay  I won't call you that  you fucking Nazi  and then all of a sudden  you hear this scuffle  it went on for about  30 seconds 
[03:21:30]  45 seconds  then you hear Nick  go ow ow  I cut my hand  you fucking winnetic  or something like that  and then that was  the end of it  well  Louis then  posted something  on his blog  that said  that it was part of  a show that they were  doing  and that it was fake  and that it was  tightly scripted  but they improvised it  but some extra  on the set  leaked it  and he was very upset  because now  you know  the production  was contaminated  by everybody  seeing this  oh  yeah  I saw Nick 
[03:22:00]  last night  the whole thing  was just a bit  that they were doing  for Louis  for Louis' new show  wow  some fucking extra  recorded that  and fucking posted  you fucking believe  what a douche  what's that  he posted it  as if it was real  that fucking  cocksucker  I hope that fucking  guy never works again  for violating that  on a set  wow that's fucked up  alright it makes sense  now  what a prick  really despicable  it was bad  and I actually did  my second post 
[03:22:30]  because I had just  posted something like  what the heck  was that about  does anybody help  and I got  somebody posted me  a link to Louis'  blog  and I did post that  on my Twitter  just so everybody  would know  it was fake  I would love to get  Louis on the phone  and just see how he feels  about this extra  posting  of course  he's probably livid  Louis called us  last week I think it was  he listens every morning  oh he doesn't  he's fucking passed out  in his fucking  diaper like undershorts  on his fucking stomach  with his red freckles  fuck Louis 
[03:23:00]  and his mother's cunt  with a fucking  rolled up newspaper  alright Steve  he's got freckles  on his penis  I still don't understand  what  what Nick was upset about  well that's what I told Nick  I saw Nick last night  and I said  what gave it away  for me  was  we got Louis right here  ok  hold on a minute  Louis is a big star  Doc Steve  you want to have  the pleasure  of being on the  phone with 
[03:23:30]  Louis  but the point is  does Louis want  the disgrace  oh no  you are  good  you are a douche  Louis  hey  hi Lou  what the fuck  what's up  what's up guys  who's there  hi  we got Jimmy  Jimmy Norton  and Anthony  and Opie  and Danny  yes  we heard about  the whole  brouhaha  yeah  everyone's calling us  about this  this clip  and I guess  we're trying to get  to the bottom of it  yeah  it was 
[03:24:00]  we were shooting  a scene for my show  with Nick playing  pretty much himself  and me playing myself  and the idea  was just that  we  we get  you know  like I do  first you see me  on stage  and then you see  Nick on stage  doing his inflammatory  right wing material  and  and  and  and the crowd  doesn't like one of his jokes  and we're upstairs  at the cellar  I mean at the all three  and he says  those people are hypocrites  and I start giving him shit 
[03:24:30]  for being very  I do it all the time  I'm like hey  well maybe you did better  at the Hitler Youth Rally  and  you know  he's like  ha ha  liberal douche  and whatever  we're just giving each other shit  but then it ratchets up  and it gets ugly  but it was scripted  and planned  we you know  it's a written piece  right  but the  it's funny  because the idea was  I wanted it to seem  really nasty  I wanted it to get  out of hand  right  I wanted it to feel like  like we don't curse  until  um 
[03:25:00]  like not really  until we start  getting into the fight  and we start saying  fuck a lot  and you  I'm gonna bleep those  um  but it's supposed to feel  like we were shooting a scene  and it got ugly  that was the way  it was  it was scripted  yeah I got it  aww  but so  but so  I'm gonna make breakfast  for my kids right now  anyway  so we shot it a few times  and you know  we did a pretty real fight  like a little  just you know  really awkward  guys in their 40s  slapping  and then grappling  you know 
[03:25:30]  yeah  and so we did it  a few times  and then  some guy  who was an extra  on the show  somebody who we hired  some  you know  fucking asshole  brought  some device  and recorded it  and he posted it  on his twitter  saying that it was  a real fight  Jesus  what a fucking  piece of shit  dude  no it's the most  obnoxious thing  anybody  I mean here's the thing  for my feeling  is that  if an audience member  comes and records shit  and they  YouTube it 
[03:26:00]  it's really annoying  but I get it  cause they just don't  have the same  they're just not  in the same world  they don't get  what in the ass  that is  but this is a  fucking person  who we hired  who we paid  to help us  on the shoot  and he did this  it's just really  cause now it's like  contaminated  the shows  going on  you know  I don't want that  material out there  I don't want it  to be on a Howard Stern show  and also  I got Nick to go to  extremes of his  political views 
[03:26:30]  and I did  on my end too  neither of us  believe any of that shit  we're just  getting mad  yeah so in  the context  of just  hey this is real  it makes you guys  look like fucking  you know  assholes  yeah to both extremes  because I don't think  we're Republicans  or Nazis  that's the dumbest thing  I've ever said  and he doesn't  say shit like white guilt  that's a very cheesy  version of Nick  but I pushed him  to do it  because he got us  to this place  and also Nick and I  have known each other  we used to be roommates  we've known each other 
[03:27:00]  for 23 years  we never have agreed  politically  but we can talk  like people  of course  the thing that's great  and this is where I knew  because I know you guys  and I thought it was  when I heard the word  like you called Nick a Nazi  and he went  my dad fought the Nazis  knowing Nick  that wouldn't have gotten him  mad enough to be physical  because I know the guy  it's like  yeah I'm a Nazi  what am I  by the way  his dad was 7  in World War 2  exactly  and he wouldn't have  fought the Nazis anyway  he would have given them rides  his dad was a real badass  or he fought for the Germans 
[03:27:30]  who used 7 year olds  exactly  so what happened now  with this fucking extra  what's that?  what happened with this extra now  what did you  did you fucking  well we're going after him  I mean I've never wanted  to like you know  I mean I don't know  I gotta say  I guess I gotta be careful  because my lawyers  are writing them letters  and stuff  lawyers that's good  in this case it's warranted  when you violate that  on a set  when you record  private material  and post it  like what  did he get anything  personal out of it 
[03:28:00]  like did he appear  anywhere with it?  no he put it on his Twitter  it's funny how fast stuff goes  he put it on his Twitter  and it went up  and the next thing you know  it's on YouTube  because somebody  I think it's a fan  of you guys  one of your peeps  type of people  an ONA fan  found it  and so  it was two pieces  and he put them together  and he put pictures over it  you know how people do that now  and so he did that  and he put it up  now the YouTube guy  is where they  where the Stern show  got it 
[03:28:30]  and that's where it got  it got most of its exposure  even off of YouTube  but I wrote that guy  right away  and said  take this shit down  it's not meant  to be out there  and he took it down  right away  the YouTube guy  felt bad  he didn't  he didn't know  once it's out there  then everybody else  has a right  to go at it  yeah he didn't know  so  he was just posting  what he thought  was newsworthy  and the violator  is the extra  and I know you don't want  to say who he is  that's fine  but was he an actor  or was he a comedian  he's an actor  he's not anybody  I'd known 
[03:29:00]  he's an extra  he's an  I mean you know  they like to be called  background  but who gives a shit  he's an actor  he's a guy  who couldn't get  fucking speaking parts  he's an extra  and he  his Twitter page  says that he's  a filmmaker  extraordinaire  and he has  a head shot  of himself  like with his  arm up  like with his  hands behind his head  if you go on  Twitter  his Twitter name  is Robert E. Taylor  all one word  alright  Robert the letter  E. Taylor  all one word 
[03:29:30]  if you search  for people  on Twitter  you'll see his  stupid face  there it is  look at the picture  by the way  on the set  I remember him  I remember looking  over and going  what is that  doing here  can you get  get that picture  better  yeah blow that  picture up  I want to see  I want to see  that horrid  fucking awful  hack actor  picture  we actually  we actually  he's supposed 
[03:30:00]  to he was  sitting right  behind me  in the scene  but we moved  him because  he was wearing  this powder green  shirt that was  just stupid  his smoldering  look really  annoys me  oh yeah  look he's  got his bedroom  eyes on  that's laying  back  he's taken  down all  of the stuff  that he posted  because he also  posted a picture  of me  taking  I was taking  a nap  between takes  in a closed  set  surrounded by  my crew  and cast  I took a nap  and he took  a picture of it  and posted it  and said  this is him 
[03:30:30]  after the fight  but  what a fucking  asshole  and he thought  this was going  to work out  for him  what  I don't know  what he  what a dummy  man  people just don't  care  and again  I'm going to  say again  that if it  was just a  person who's  outside of  show business  who thinks  hey cool  look who I  got inside  of this  I was at  this show  and I saw  something weird  happen  I get it  but this is  a person  who  that you  hired  I mean  it's a whole  it's two  things  it's just  a generational  thing that  people don't  when they're  working for  somebody  they don't 
[03:31:00]  understand  that's a  sacred thing  somebody's  paying you  so you should  want to do  your best  for them  but  you know  so part of it  is just me  I'm 42  looking at this  guy who's probably  20 whatever  hope he's  dead soon  whatever  however many  years  you know  his age  nine months  ago  that his  disgusting  parents  shoved  their  fucking  penis  and vagina  together  Jesus  awesome  but you know  what Louie  even though he is  young  there's certain  things that you  just know  again  you said  he's an audience  member  they just 
[03:31:30]  don't live  in the world  but he's  the guy  who should  know better  he's on a  set  you don't  fucking  do that  on a set  ever  I'm a  fucking  picture whore  and I love  photos  I would  never ask  on an  active  set  ever  it certainly  is  it's not  going to  help him  obviously  I don't care  about sharing  I've always  said like  sometimes people  come to my  shows  and they put  my show  like they'll  record it on  their cell phone  they put it  on YouTube  I never get  mad at these  people or tell  them like  I don't go  you're stealing  from me  I just tell 
[03:32:00]  them hey  this is new  stuff and you're  actually hurting  me creatively  I'm trying to  put this stuff  out carefully  and they always  take it down  this isn't  about like  someone stole  my property  it's about  let me finish  the fucking  show before  people hear  it  idiots  yeah  and you know  Louis is about  sharing  it's like  Louis's motto  is share and  share alike  I've heard him  say it many times  it's on bumper  stickers that he  sells after shows  I'm not again  sharing  fuck your mother  it's not your  mother is about  the virus  my mother's not  about the virus  she is the virus 
[03:32:30]  her name is  actually AIDS  Norton  oh my god  that's amazing  that is amazing  and Louis  now the big  bummer is you  probably can't  use this material  now  I'll use it  you'll figure out  a way to make  it work  no I mean  it's just one  scene inside  of an episode  and I mean  I will say  the one positive  feeling I get  out of it  is that  we acted  it well enough  that folks  bought it  to a large degree  sure  I got a lot  of emails  from people  saying I can't  believe that  you got in a  fight with Nick  DiPaolo  and the great  thing is  because I wrote  it I win the  fight I cut  his hand 
[03:33:00]  and he starts  going get off  me  that is hilarious  that is awesome  get off me  look I played  football in college  bitch DiPaolo  Nick broke his  hand  I've never run  more than 14  feet and he's  going get off  me like I'm  hurting him  Nick broke his  hand punching  a heckler  that's why I  really adored  DiPaolo  he injured  himself physically  fighting for all  comics  I just love his  ideology  by the way  the other point  of this thing  was that 
[03:33:30]  Nick and I  we've been  opposite sides  of the political  spectrum our  whole lives  we've always  gotten along  and I feel like  that's also  a generational  thing because  people can't do  that anymore  right  with the Glenn  Beck and all  the Ariana  Huffington  nobody can be  friends  or the Al  Frankens  disagree  anymore  oh Anthony  and Jeanine  Garofalo  he said  Huffington  I don't care  she's very  very left  oh yeah  Louis threw  one of each  in  I don't care  I throw  all of the  one side  in  see how I  balanced it  in 
[03:34:00]  I put it  in both  I don't  that's right  share and  share alike  and let's  all get  along  those are  Lou's  mottos  what do you  want to  you want to  fight now  Lou  yeah  tough guy  yes  I'm a freckled  pile of shit  that's another  one of his  mottos  I saw  Nick last  night  Nick was  saying how  great the  piece was  he goes  dude  it's one  of the  best  things I've  ever done  on film  he might  have said  it's the  best thing  he's ever  done  on film  he was  really raving  about you  yeah I  didn't know  what the  fuck  was up  my twitter  exploded  I'm like  I don't  fucking  know  and then 
[03:34:30]  the link  was gone  I'm like  Nick  was great  by the way  he's so  good in  the bit  he's like  when we  did the  fight  and we're  standing  he throws  water in  my face  the thing  about my  father  and he's  so real  to me  he's like  what De Niro  used to be  before he  just became  a weirdo  I haven't  seen anybody  get that angry  on film  in an interesting  way in a long  time  that's cool  now I want 
[03:35:00]  to see it  in the proper  context  before De Niro  started doing  awful press  conferences  for those of  you that know  me in New York  there might be  a bull here  that rages  too  he cannot  say anything  interesting  he can't  tell a fucking  joke  he's terrible  it's horrid  all equity  gone  I gotta go  take my kids  to school  guys  you're adorable  see you Lou  thanks Lou  thanks brother 
[03:35:30]  look forward  to my call  for hopefully  doing my  Louis CK  piece  is it  happening  I hope so  I want to  play a  billionaire  a mogul  yeah  all right  what will  your name  be  what  what would  your name  be  billionaire  Jimmy  hey  go and join  this is the  worst  opium  anthony  serious  xm  oh  jesus

[03:38:00]  ago was this  travis  i'm not  sure  couldn't have  been that  many though  do you think  do you think  getting married  on a major  holiday is  selfish too  yes  and they always  do that because  they save money  yeah because  nobody else is  getting married  i had to go to  a wedding that  was very very  close to  christmas eve  i'm like are you  serious i gotta run  around like a  lunatic this  weekend and try to  get some shopping  done i've got  people have them

[03:39:00]  mother and  child uh  immersed in  fluid  the unborn  child  could have been  a doctor  or scientist  instead wound  up with salt  what we call  brine on the  brain  for being at  the bottom  of the ocean  that was it  what year  what i have  no idea  old ben  gardener  pussy  a little head

[03:41:00]  at a speech  extemporaneously  myself so  i say really  inappropriate  things so  i've got some  notes here  normally  oh  this sounds  very recent  within the last  couple of years  really  yeah  if he's googling  then it's got to be  and double  visectomy  todd is not an old  guy  this is like a  valedictorian  so he can't even  use the excuse  that happened  years ago  i mean it could  have happened  a few years ago  but no more  than that  i would get up 
[03:41:30]  and tell a lovely  story about how  todd and ashley  met  and how they  fell in love  unfortunately  no one knows  it's apparently  a big secret  we found out  about it on  facebook  since i don't  know anything  clever to say  about marriage  i thought i'd  consult some  experts in the  field  henny youngman  once said  the secret  to a long  and happy  marriage  remains a  secret  that's the  best of luck  picture  yeah  yeah  and uh 
[03:42:00]  oj simpson  once said  you white  bitch  i'm gonna  cut your  head off  that's the  best of luck  picture  yeah  yeah  but don't  look  i'm bombing  up here  it's okay  mickey rooney  said this  about marriage  hey  take me out  of this room  my caregiver  is punching  me  that's what  mickey rooney  said  he said i  was cute  in 1948  and now my  caregiver is  hitting me 
[03:42:30]  with my  dirty diapers  maybe i should  shut up  about clean  comedy  because i was  kind of stunk  i don't know  why people  thought i was  cute  that's what  mickey rooney  said  mickey rooney  said i should  be dead like  andy  about marriage  always get  married early  in the morning  that way if  it doesn't work  out you  haven't wasted  a whole day  even socrates 
[03:43:00]  spoke about  marriage thousands  of years ago  greek homo  by all means  marry he said  if you get a  good wife you'll  be happy  if you get a  bad one  become a  philosopher  now the bible  discourse is on  love in  1st  christians 13  love suffers  long and is  kind love  does not envy  love does not  parade itself  is not puffed  up love does  not behave rudely  does not seek  its own is not  provoked thinks  no evil love 
[03:43:30]  does not rejoice  in iniquity but  rejoices in the  truth love bears  all things believes  all things hopes  all things endures  all things love  never fails  but i'll tell you  what does fail  me when i'm  making a speech  that's horrific  speech  hold a glass of  apple juice  he's in no  alcohol wedding  i give this speech  at the hospice  when i want people  to not really want  to live anymore  i'm the get them  out of their bed  guy when we have 
[03:44:00]  a long waiting  list  i got old mr  hodges to finally  kick over and  give up  talk to him with  love anecdotes  he actually read  that thing they  read at the  weddings  i was sipping  a sierra mist  here are some  other things  love doesn't say  what are you  doing how about  now how about  now what are  you doing now  how about now  who was that  that just called  wow 
[03:44:30]  i swear i'm  almost done  love doesn't ask  does this kilt  make my butt  look bad  he wears a  kilt from what  i hear  he wears a  kilt at the  wedding  not dr steve's  room  love is an  electric blanket  with someone else  in control of the  switch  as we raise our  alcohol free glasses  and remind our  hosts that jesus  first miracle in  the bible was  turning water into  wine at a wedding 
[03:45:00]  todd and ashley  i hope you will  be as happy as  casey and i  thought we'd be  dr steve  it was short  anyway  that was  oh my god  luca brazi was  more comfortable  at the wedding  than you were  why a non-alcoholic 
[03:45:30]  wedding first of  all that is so  selfish i know he's  your pal but what  the fuck  well i think  you know i think  it um his  wife's father is  a minister and he  doesn't believe in  drinking although  no it's true  oh so so make  your cater to  your your the  father there  yeah and the you  know his wife  will not love to  you know go to  the bars and  slam shots 
[03:46:00]  and uh but  she she's never  drunk in front of  her father and  you know they  were afraid she'd  probably have a  fucking issue  did you do a few  uh shots before  you uh went  no i think we  had a flask but i  never got to it  because it was just  so you should have  a little booze on  that speech might  have yeah there  were a lot of you  know the christians  there and i i thought  it was a little edgy  and you know in  giving them you know  a nudge about the  alcohol free wedding 
[03:46:30]  but you know and  turning water into  wine but that was  about as edgy as i  felt i like your  delivery there  at a wedding  yeah  hey laddie  hey laddie  yeah you did a  little valby  john valby  yeah i know a  girl her name is  ashley  yeah that's uh  that was uh that  was uh that was  non-alcoholic  weddings suck  because most  weddings in general 
[03:47:00]  suck  why did you do  the uh take the  alcohol away on top  of it  why the biblical  reading there  did not happen at  the church anyway  because it was a  minister  but didn't that  happen at the  church don't they  read that at the  church  it looks like  everyone was  catering to the  minister  they didn't in  their in their  uh in their  ceremony but it  was just to get to  the thing that says  well here's the  other things that  oh you were setting  up your gags  right you're using  the teachings of god  i get it  a bit of a long  setup but you know 
[03:47:30]  i figured i'd suck  them in with the  biblical revel  you sucked  i like it  kilt jokes  yeah get right to  that kilt joke  yeah i i said but  because i originally  said is my asshole  showing but i knew  the minister might be  angry  yes it's always  cater to the minister  oh yeah yeah that's  why i didn't say  does this kilt make  my ass look  yeah what a dull  wedding that must  have been though  exactly  that was a good  speech you're the  next peggy noonan  no  you don't know who  that is that's a 
[03:48:00]  fucking i do know  who that is  yeah dr steve knows  everything so he  knows who it is  why was that a good  reference because she  was a speechwriter for  nixon  yeah and she used to  be on fox news and  she had the most  glossy lips of any  uh woman  oh look at you  oh dr steve likes  lips  yeah  like especially when  they're glossy  he's a face fucker  he's used to seeing  the ones all dried  out with a respirator  in there  they only went in  they only went in  for a knee injury  after an hour with  him  yeah we never 
[03:48:30]  asked dr steve why  are you why are you  a doctor for dead  people  oh my god  that doesn't make  sense  well i'm not i'm a  doctor for the living  they just happen to  are going to die  sooner than a lot  of other doctors  so why do they need  a doctor  another on a  skateboard  but why do they  need a doctor at  that point  here's the thing  that's the one time  you don't need a  doctor  no no no no  i disagree  if you're going  from non-life  to life  then we have  three different  medical specialties 
[03:49:00]  we've got  neonatology  and perinatology  and we've got  ob-gyn  and if you're  going from  life to non-life  there's me  and some minister  you know  it's ridiculous  how we give  that second  transition  such short shrift  do you yuck it up  with like a  grim reaper suit  sometimes you walk  in with a sickle  into the room  just look at  the beds  watch the look  on their eyes  they're dead  lifeless  fogged over eyes  i went to  see a friend 
[03:49:30]  who was in  the hospital  and i walked  in the room  and his eyes  got real big  and he said  did they consult  you on me  oh man  yeah you're  you're doctor  death  yeah no one  wants to see  you  oh man  that's gotta  be a drag  he has a good  graveside manner  yeah  that's his  bedside manner  he walks in  with a shovel  fucking dirt  on his  sorry i just  saw your  the last patient  a cross  and a bible  are you like 
[03:50:00]  the angel of  death  no no no  do you ever  have to use a  pillow  huh  i don't know  how many  how many charts  do you shred  he just  ah yeah let me  have your chart  he won't be  needing that  well we just  freed up some  space in the  file cabinet  he had a  headache  i recommended  succinylcholine  you know we  were thinking  about getting  a new  file cabinet  we don't  have to worry  about that  lost three  this week  jesus i hate  your job  that was pretty 
[03:50:30]  good  what  what  succinylcholine  reference  was that you  jim  it was  yeah  jim knows  his deadly  medications  i know  i know what you  need to paralyze  a woman before  you fuck her  your act  wow yeah dr steve  uh you could  have gotten  into a different  line right  um yeah  yeah lack of  motivation on  your part i'm  thinking it's easy  oh we lost  another one  yeah that's  that's good  for your job  how many we 
[03:51:00]  lose today  ten wow  good  all right  you're on  quota  bringing up  those beds  i think in the  in the new year  we should get  you a like a  job where  maybe the  people live  longer  well okay  he went into  this no he  went into this  one because  he knew that  his mistakes  wouldn't be as  obvious  yeah  just feel like  you know  well they're  they're close  anyway  what are you  going to  yell at me  non-positive  lymphoma  in the end  i did them  a favor  they were  suffering  huh 
[03:51:30]  unlikely that  you're gonna  there is that  mental calculation  that you do  it did go  through my head  that it's  unlikely i'll  get sued  yeah yeah  not many  malpractices  suits against  people that  are there  just watching  for people  to die  how many  people have  you literally  seen pass  from life  to death  would you  say  oh i  couldn't  count it  i mean i  see  i see four  new on average  four new  consults a day  and about 15  follow-ups  and then i do  my office 
[03:52:00]  and you know  every one of  those patients  eventually i mean  they all come to  me before they go  but do you  do you literally  are you watching  them when they're  alive and then  they're dead  sometimes  yeah like if we  do a withdrawal  you're a ghoul  i believe that's  for somebody else  pull the strings  pull the strings  come to governor's  this weekend  you'll see another  one  oh rich  you're not good  on the stage  no just trying  to be so  you think he  writes on their  charts with that  invisible ink  oh god 
[03:52:30]  i won't be  needing that  yeah  and when they  pass to the  other side  have you ever  had to explain  your erection  to people  i just get off  on death  i don't know  why  i gotta end  this line of  work  got a legit  question for  you dr steve  a lot of people  say there's an  afterlife do you  see any weird  shit in the  rooms when these  people go  no i've had a  couple of patients  that had near  death experiences  though but i  haven't seen any  weird shit when  people go  except one time  did you hang up 
[03:53:00]  on me  no no no  we're here  you're paranoid  for some reason  i'm sorry  i wonder why  now i'm weird  myself for the  hangout but  we had a lady  in vermont that  died and uh  the monks at the  priory nearby  swore that her  spirit came through  there and set off  the fire alarm at  the exact moment  that she died  that's rude on her  it could be a  coincidence i think  yeah exactly  couldn't a squirrel  you should be seeing  like spirits 
[03:53:30]  drive them crazy  when she was  alive you know  she was one of  those militant  catholics and  she drove these  monks at the  priory out of  their minds and  uh she just gave  them one last dig  on the way out  that was their  interpretation of it  dr steve i summoned  my dead dad one  day and the lights  flickered  whoa that's true  it happened in here  sam saw it we  mean and we're  talking about our  dead dads and i'm  like yeah it's all  bullshit and i said  if there's something  going on in the  afterlife show us a  sign and sam's my  witness those  fucking lights flickered  and to this day i  don't know what  the fuck it was  yeah you need 
[03:54:00]  electrical work  i had a weird  experience when my  mom died you know  i was sitting on my  front porch and all  of a sudden i just  saw this flash of  of every moment that  my mom and i had  spent together and i  was like what the  hell is going on and  then the phone rang  even the naughty  moments oh that's  terrible wait sorry  go ahead you saw all  the moments at once i  was in front of an  eight millimeter  projector watching  home movies but it  was strange wait the 
[03:54:30]  phone rang after you  had this flash  it was my brother  saying that my mom  had just died and  uh had she been  sick i saw my  birth and everything  it was bizarre it  was just one of those  crazy wow but you  saw all this before  hold on hold on hold  on you saw all this  before you got the  news officially yeah  yeah that's a little  odd had she been  sick yes no he  her death was not  unexpected matter of  fact her death is one  of the reasons i went  into hospice because 
[03:55:00]  oh wow she's when  when we suffered for  two years and nobody  knew what to do and  it was like i'm my  nobody else's mom's  gonna go through that  shit if i can help  wow look how noble  dr steve is you are a  noble guy what would  she die of sir uh  stomach cancer wow  oh my god that's a  rough one jesus jesus we  went to the house  how long would that  take to kill eroc do  you think oh fucking  decades years yes  they'd actually find  like erosion lines  like they do in  fucking uh the grand  canyons canyons 
[03:55:30]  you wrong comment  anything no okay we  rented a house once and  there was a couple that  died that were living  upstairs uh they died  their car went off a  bridge into the water  and it was a there were  a couple there were a  ghost that lived up in  our attic they were not a  ghost that lived in the  attic yeah they were and  and and uh oh there  goes another one i heard  a flat line holy shit  congratulations dr steve 
[03:56:00]  you got another one you  hit the over today the  over hit the bell there  it is all right that's it  wow dr steve gets another  one oh my god he could do  his job and radio at the  same time that's amazing i  don't know how do you do  that that is so grody oh  no valley jim valley jim  valley jim i love valley  jim yeah well what where  were we with the story  that's it i guess yeah i 
[03:56:30]  guess that's are you done  pulling out our heart  strings can we move on  with the radio show now  oh yeah dr steve funny  stuff now that i talked  about my day oh we want  to know about the best man  speech i guess we we kind  of went oh no i want to  know how many years ago is  that oh oh it was uh they  i think their one year  anniversary is next year  oh it's uh it's fresh  year so it's coming up  that's pretty uh recent  then yeah yeah i wasn't  that long i i had no 
[03:57:00]  excuse in other words  hey you're walking through  a hallway right now huh  oh god you see the light  a crypt yeah could you  keep the phone on as one  of these uh patients go  geez it's terrible  what no you don't want  to hear that no death  rattle yeah hey dr steve  when are you going to be  in new york again  um i don't know definitely  before october nice echo  that's great are you the 
[03:57:30]  crematorium  holy shit  what a ghoul  i know everything i just  picture you just such  ghoulish  i understand why you're in  it but you're a ghoul  yeah  no i don't know it's very  you know i get thanked  every day  by who not your patients  family members  the insurance company  yes  here's another gift basket  from all states  and real estate agents 
[03:58:00]  all over  all over tennessee  yes  thank you  every day  every day by who  thank god she was a real  twat  clean up bedpans  yeah  yeah no i mean  people are just very  thankful that you take  them  because i do a lot of  cancer pain  and uh patients uh  you know one day are  miserable and you walk  in the next day and  they're feeling good for  the first time in months  and you know it's very  rewarding  oh  oh so you give them 
[03:58:30]  that that that that  false sense of a little  glimmer  that's nice  you give them oxycontin  yeah  well you get there's  different levels of hope  and i've you know there  may not be a hope of a  cure but they can at  least hope that they can  live without  pain you know  are you one of those  doctors where you go one  for me one for them  ah  may one for them  yeah  like how  how that happens to  some people though  do you uh do you give  these people morphine  do you give these people 
[03:59:00]  morphine  yeah morphine is one of  the things that we use  oh man  do you try it out  almost makes it all  worth it  they have chronic pain  uh you know we use  morphine dilaudid uh  oxycodone um methadone  there's all kinds of  things  wow  we don't just use  narcotics  a lot of pain  what do you do  voodoo  it's a  it's a  well we use acupuncture  too but it's a  comprehensive  it doesn't work  we done with dr steve  yeah i think we should 
[03:59:30]  let him get back to his  patients  you're listening to the  worst of the opium anthony  show  on sirius xm  you're listening to the  worst of the opium anthony  show  on sirius xm  how are you sir it's been a while  hi dr kaku  did you forget about us  yeah i'm right here  yes  dr kaku we've seen you on the  news uh of late  talking about the wildfires  and uh perhaps um the 
[04:00:00]  nuclear facility at los  alamos  right in fact the fire is  three miles away from a  major waste plutonium waste  dump at los alamos  so  this is the moment of  truth now  what are some of the  dangers that can be  encountered uh from this  fire if it does reach the  uh the facility  well they're up to 30  thousand canisters uh  plutonium waste uh three  miles from the fire  just sitting above ground  not even protected  oh wow 
[04:00:30]  and in protected sites by  the way sites that are  locked down  uh we have up to six  tons of plutonium  this is plutonium from the  weapons program  uh hopefully no terrorist  will sift through the  wreckage of a fire and  grab some of this  plutonium but six tons  worth  uh plutonium is also  stored on site in a  secured area  but the unsecured area  was causing all the worry  right now  because it's low-level  plutonium waste  plutonium is the most  toxic chemical known to  science  a microgram that you 
[04:01:00]  can't even see a  particle in your lungs  will cause lung cancer  wow  so the danger is that a  fire will over  pressurize the drums  pop them open  and then liquids will  boil and a lot of  solid materials will  vaporize  so  and it will have a  plutonium cloud emerging  over los alamos  or not  and then of course the  winds will whip it up  winds travel at about  60 miles an hour in that  area  yeah  so when are you going  to blow your head off  of something right  and  yeah that's right  that's the danger 
[04:01:30]  that there could be a  plume of plutonium  rising from  from los alamos  sweeping down  now the fire department  of course says  everything's under  control  but uh two years  ago the department  of energy  that's probably a  department where they  get stuff done fast  because it's all  energy right  no the department  of energy is uh  we all know what that  is chip  thank you  uh so the fire  department said uh  what sir  why are you going to  fire the whole department  what'd they do  yeah they criticized  the fire department  for being uh  not up to speed  uh oh they would be 
[04:02:00]  overwhelmed if there  was a fire involving  sophisticated nuclear  materials  i would think  what what are they  talking about  is there an evacuation  plan are there uh  residents around that  area  yeah the residents are  out uh the whole  town's been evacuated  it's a ghost town  now  uh only fire crews  are allowed on site  and remember that uh  fire crews could  easily be overwhelmed  if the wind changes  direction  oh absolutely yes  what happens if the  wind gets all blown  and stuff and if the  nuclear stuff's getting  blown all over your  hat like danger or 
[04:02:30]  something i mean is  that bad for the fire  department or something  well it'd be bad for  everybody if the  premium dust got in  the air because it'd  be invisible it would  uh sweep down like in  a plume and get your  hair your nostrils your  clothing vegetation it  would be a real mess if  that happened  but is it something to  do with the computers  like war games or  something i was telling  people scandals that  uh yeah but remember  that right now uh the  department could be  overwhelmed completely  if the winds change  directions if the wind  whips up more more 
[04:03:00]  debris uh the fire  department by the way  it says there's a  canyon there's a canyon  separating the waste dump  from the fire but you  know ashes embers could  very easily burn in  embers was my band  yeah they they could uh  they could actually uh  hold on to some of  this nuclear material  and carry it uh pretty  far i would gather  all right so we have  to be very careful  about this and like i  said we also have  secured sites with  some of them underground  some of them above  ground in steel buildings  but these buildings have 
[04:03:30]  never been tested against  a major fire so it's a  science project as to  whether or not we can  contain six tons of  plutonium fuel uh that  could be used at seven  tons what type of uh  what type of radius uh  uh area of um of uh  what type of area of of  uh toxicity are we  looking at here  well if you take a look  at uh chernobyl and  fukushima most of the  radiation was concentrated  within about 10 to 15 
[04:04:00]  miles the dead zone  around chernobyl is  around 19 miles uh the  the the dead zone around  fukushima will be  approximately that same  radius about 19 miles and  in that area it's a ghost  town uh no one's allowed  there right uh you know  there's no economic  activity no one lives  there it's i thought  basically off limits for  you know several centuries  so the whole town is  probably like right  nobody would be going to  the movies or nothing  there's just something  like that right  haha well  yeah right i remember 
[04:04:30]  the los alamos is the  crown jewel of our  nuclear weapons program  and it could become a  ghost town if this is a  big if plutonium leaks  out of those canisters  yes now now los alamos  uh that is still an  operational facility  oh sure  yeah of course  they maintain our  nuclear arsenal uh that's  where the atomic bomb was  built uh underground  testing took place uh in  fact the fires are now  raging right over the  area where we used to do  underground nuclear tests  uh in in new mexico  wow and uh we still 
[04:05:00]  regularly regularly uh  handle plutonium there on  site that's what this is  heavy wow do you carry it  how do you get it from  around i thought it was  supposed to be bad or  something uh well  personal plutonium in  metallic form is very  heavy but it's very  small how much is it like  50 pounds or something  well the the basic  components of the  nakasaki bomb would be  about the size of a  softball right right  right right the actual  plutonium itself is  rather compact and  rather small but there's  hundreds of bombs worth 
[04:05:30]  of fuel on site  it only takes about 20  pounds to create an  atomic bomb so the bomb  the bomb that guy dropped  over um nakasaki is the  the was only the side of  a softball was the  plutonium uh that's right  the actual plutonium itself  is a little bit bigger than  a softball in fact one of  my acquaintances uh professor  uh name morris at MIT  actually loaded the  nakasaki bomb with his  bare hands oh really  don't shake his hands 
[04:06:00]  their hands i once asked  him how do you load a  nakasaki bomb yeah and he  said very carefully  uh... that's the actual  way to do it  his nickname was stumpy  very carefully now uh...  uh... for the for the  layman here uh... doctor  kaku there is not any uh...  chance of a an actual  nuclear explosion from this  no no no first of all to  create a nuclear detonation  you have to have a trigger and  the trigger is a very precise 
[04:06:30]  set of explosives which  explode the plutonium  so even iran for example  even if iran and and uh...  uh... korea in north korea  they have what would have  problems compressing the  plutonium yes it is uh... made  into what they call a critical  mass what through uh...  church right using either  shape charges or uh... some  type of a uh... actually a  cannon system i believe was  used in one of the first uh...  atomic bombs that's right 
[04:07:00]  nick cannon's good the  hiroshima bomb used the gun  principle or the  hiroshima yes everyone  uh... pac-man with a pie  shaped thing with a with a  slice coming out that's  pac-man so i think a pac-man  made out of uranium right  one pipe piece oh pac-mans  to the other pac-man piece  right yeah i was never any  good at that game i used to  never get past the third  board or something and that  and that would make uh...  uh... the uh... the critical  mass uh... what what 
[04:07:30]  the mass is about the size  of your fist right oh wow  that's pretty cool i gotta go  i like to box what would  limit the size of an atomic  explosion uh... let's say you  could come up with um...  uh... nuclear weapons grade  fuel the size of let's say a  beach ball yeah would you be  able to use that and in and  and have a uh... an explosion to  to turn that into uh... its  own critical mass and and  have a gigantic nuclear 
[04:08:00]  nuclear explosion so big that  it knocked everybody the sun  off of something yeah yeah  one of my colleagues was  ted taylor and he actually  designed that bomb you're  talking about oh really i  remember working closely  together yes it was designed  by ted taylor by my  ted taylor of course is that  his real name it sounds like  a fake name is it tetley  taylor ted taylor and what  uh... what what difficulties  are there in something that  large what would be different  than using something the  size of a softball how much  is it way if you got to pick 
[04:08:30]  up like fifty pounds of it  don't listen to him uh...  uh... it's quite heavy right  i i i actually want to know  what this the uh... difficulties  would be in a bomb that big  yeah would you be able to  throw it at people or  something  engineering something that  big that's why we go to  hydrogen bombs that's why  yes  hydrogen bombs could also be  roughly the same size and  they would yield a thousand  times more energy all right  atomic bombs now do i don't  don't hydrogen bombs use  atomic uh... explosives as  some type of uh... primer or 
[04:09:00]  that's just a big rumor  that's right a hydrogen bomb  uses lithium deuteride lithium  deuteride is uh...  deuteride thing  from a chemistry store uh...  but lithium deuteride in  concentrated form is the basic  fuel of a hydrogen bomb  right  you use the atomic bomb as a  fuse as a fuse  wow that is something and  and now all these materials  uh... reside at los alamos and  uh... there's a fire uh...  sweeping maybe towards this  area 
[04:09:30]  yet the heck of a broom  what uh... what what precautions  are they taking besides just  getting um... uh... fire crews  out there are they doing  anything at the plant to try to  uh... protect these especially  the exposed fuel  is there hay around it  well the the basic fail safe  uh... is to use foam  uh... to get fire trucks  to make  and  spray foam  on top of these canisters  and that's it  right that's it  that's it  just try to keep them as  as cool as possible  um  these are tax dollars that 
[04:10:00]  work  yeah the fire is a  probably  if the wind  if the wind changes  direction  yeah  fire engulfs this area  uh... it's all over  fire is hot  wow  i got a barn one time  when i was a kid  how worried are you sir  uh... well right now  the the winds are dying  down at the present time  perfect  not as windy  however the winds are  unpredictable  sure  yeah  unpredictable  sure  and we have a three mile  barrier between uh... the  fire and the actual 
[04:10:30]  sighted  four miles would be  better right  aren't there uh...  dr kago  aren't there certain  chemicals besides foam  that could  encase uh... you know  how they spray beams  with um... uh... flame  retardant uh...  uh... material  nice  to keep uh... metal  from melting  during a high rise  fire  couldn't they spray  these canisters  and maybe i have a  little more time  if a fire does  sweep through  like maybe throw  mattresses on them  or something  throw everything  with the kitchen  sink at these  canisters  i know like  it's right  you know 
[04:11:00]  denny or something  remember it's  the local fire  department  uh... we're not  talking about the  united states  military coming in  now if it is  something that big  uh... why wouldn't  they have the  national guard come in  and uh... maybe  one guy that's  why it's too much  work for one person  probably  maybe start uh...  taking some  precautions before  something happens  cookie people  that's what i would  suggest  yeah  now uh... yeah  i think they want  to they don't want  to create panic  and so i think  that's why they're  downplaying the  danger  and i think 
[04:11:30]  that's gonna happen  right  uh... but you  know just last  year another report  came out saying  that there's  lack  i hate doing  reports  of a fire  yeah  and then as i  mentioned two  years ago they  said that the  local fire department  would be overwhelmed  in case of a major  fire  and that's kind of  what's happening  reports are coming  true  and that's what  we're looking at  they said we  have to mention  your book too  it's like physics  of the future  yes  and it was a  nine times  bestseller  that's new york  times bestseller  i thought it was  any times bestseller  it was a bestseller 
[04:12:00]  at any time  physics of the future  yeah physics of the  future by dr kaku  this book has really  taken off a lot  of people  really enjoying  i know are  really enjoying  this  you take physics  and really do  make it  entertaining for the  layman  make it understandable  and kind of  incorporate things  from entertainment  and what not  and our basic  questions that we  have about physics  and you do a great  job  do you address  stuff like  it's very practical 
[04:12:30]  in the sense that  physics will change  our life  he's better  than i am  yeah  it will take  you to the year  2100  but even 10 years  from now  the internet  for example  will be in our  contact lens  so we will blink  and we will go  online  and your contact lens  will identify  people's faces  so you'll know  always who you're  talking to  no more  awkward moments  of saying  oh who is that  person  i had contacts 
[04:13:00]  but my prescription  was changing  so what would  happen if you  had internet contacts  and your prescription  was no good  or something  ow  well you might  have a problem  there  however  put dry stuff  on them  right  at a cocktail  party  we'll always know  who to suck up  to at a cocktail  party  right  exactly  what's that  i never invited  to one  dr kaku  dr kaku  i got a question  for you  yeah opi has  something to ask  you sir  when you're not  when you're not  doing physics  what do you like  to do  uh well  realize that physics  is everywhere  so i i basically 
[04:13:30]  apply it  apply it to the  future  apply it to  our daily life  you are like  an application  of thought  you know  everywhere you  move there's  physics  right  yeah i'm  jim norton  has just  entered the  studio  and i gotta  tell you sir  me and jim  norton live  very close  to you  very close  we don't want  to give away  your location  but we're  pretty much  your neighbors  and uh  i i've noticed  that i've yelled  uh hi to you  a couple times  and um  you don't you  don't say hi  back and i think  maybe there might  be a problem  or something  you're not mad  at us  are you 
[04:14:00]  huh  either or else  i'm nearsighted  and missed you  see it could  just be as uh  next time you  hear someone  yell hey dr  kaku opie from  the opie and  anthony show  that's me  and i just want  to say hi  because i know  you're you live  in the neighborhood  uh-huh  okay i will  uh-huh  well dr  kaku uh  thank you so  much  jimmy you  have anything  to add to this  jimmy  and he's back  in the studio  yeah one time  i was on the  elevator and  and uh  i was like  this is a good  job  it's got  ups and downs  dr kaku 
[04:14:30]  thank you so  much for uh  joining us  uh we were  very curious  about this uh  los alamos  uh nuclear  uh facility  and the fire  they lost it  and uh  uh you're our  go-to guy  as far as  physics go  and uh  good luck  with the book  and we'll  talk to you  again soon  no need to  call him a  goat  thank you  dr kaku  wait one second  how much  is the earth  weigh  six sextillion  tons  thank you  that's a lot  i guessed  five everybody  told me i was  crazy  what's a  sextillion  is that like 
[04:15:00]  a tillion  that looks  really good  thank you  dr kaku  how much  does the sun  weigh in  in kilograms  all right  all right  let the good  doctor go  he's got tv  interviews to  do sir  thank you  sir  there he  goes  i've never  been so  embarrassed  with anyone  on the phone  in my life  but wait  what was my  favorite  there are  shima  hirashima  hirashima 
[04:15:30]  there  shima  everywhere  shima  shima  you asshole  oh that  had me  fucking  on the  edge  you flip  that  because that  wasn't  the reason  my tongue  that wasn't  the reason  we were  gonna have  a mother  phone  oh god  damn  we have  line of  the day  you do  that  in the  10 o'clock  hour  sam  we gotta  play a  flock of  beats  before we  get out  of here  chip is  really not  a good  interviewer  no chip  is a  horrible  interviewer  he just  interrupts 
[04:16:00]  he did  do a great  job of  just focusing  and concentrating  he's oblivious  to chip  like myself  i like that  it's like  so next time  say hi  and he's like  ah  people are  so annoyed  fucking chip  shut the  fuck up  jim i am  feeling so  uncomfortable  right now  with your  call  with  cuckoo  yeah that's  a lot of  people are  saying over  here  like oh  my god  i can't  even listen  to this  chip is 
[04:16:30]  it got me  so embarrassed  for myself  jim norton  chip  shut the  fuck up  or something  says  shut the  fuck up  or something  jim norton  shut up  i annoyed  them  yeah  i saw  i was trying  to do a  real interview  so i was  like well  you know  no  that works  that was a  whole gag  that was a  whole gag  just like  do an  interview  with him  a dumb  fucking  chip  is saying 
[04:17:00]  here is  she  there is  she  win it  win it  boo  that's it  for the  worst of  opie and  anthony  well gentlemen  another show  well done  i knew what  to expect  a douche chill  moment  and boy  did you  deliver  check out  the on a  show on  facebook  at facebook.com  slash opie and  thing  and catch  opie and  anthony live  monday through  friday from 6  to 10 a.m.  eastern  sirius xm  to 10 a.m. </pre>
