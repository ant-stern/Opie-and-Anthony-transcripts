<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a montage highlighting its controversial nature, immediately setting the tone.  The hosts launched into a discussion about Valentine's Day gifts, Opie's struggles to find a suitable present, and the age of Valentine's Day candy. This segued into a graphic description of a psychiatrist's brutal attack with a meat cleaver. The conversation then shifted to the upcoming presidential election, focusing on Barack Obama and a photograph of him with Al Sharpton, prompting a debate about Sharpton's negative image.  Jim Norton discussed his upcoming comedy shows in San Francisco and his anxieties about the city's liberal population.  The hosts then used derogatory language to describe Eskimos in a discussion about Alaska, followed by a bizarre anecdote about a man with a nail lodged in his penis.  An animation contest based on the show was mentioned, along with clips of Obama's speeches. The hosts frequently interrupted each other and used vulgar humor throughout this segment.

The show continued with humorous stories about men's embarrassing injuries, often involving nudity. This transitioned to a discussion of the Roger Clemens Congressional hearing, with the hosts and a caller, Travis, mocking Clemens' testimony and Brian McNamee's accusations.  A comedic bit ensued about selling fictitious memorabilia from the steroid scandal.

Callers Jim and Doug debated the merits of protecting children from this experience, with Doug drawing an extreme comparison to the Chinese education system.  Fifth-grade teacher Tiffany called in to share her classroom's Valentine's Day approach.  The segment concluded with a Stephen Lynch song about Black women and a discussion of an animated recap of a previous show segment, as well as Sam and Big A’s visit to the Playboy Mansion, including a mention of an interview with Hugh Hefner.

The next segment featured caller Sam detailing his experience at a Playboy Mansion party, focusing on the bizarre behavior of "Big A."

FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The girl gives you a strip club advice, and then you go and see The Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  It's your girlfriend and it was you.  Did you learn a payment is going?  I think if you were touched inappropriately, it would make it like a quick pop song, like the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah, what?  They're like, sick, freak!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Happy Valentine's Day!  Oh, you're the first one to get that out. 
[00:01:30]  I forgot.  You did not forget, Jimmy.  Did you, Jim?  I'm going away.  I've got to buy my girlfriend something for Valentine's Day.  She's going with me.  Get yourself something nice.  She's not going with you?  Oh, yeah, she is.  She kept saying, like, I can't wait for you to see your Valentine's Day gift.  I'm like, yeah.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  I have a Whitman sampler, stupid.  I have some bracks.  I got some bracks at the local pharmacy.  Know what's up with the bracks?  Well, I probably shouldn't say that they're doing this, but I did read an article that Valentine's Day candy could be up to a year old. 
[00:02:00]  Ooh.  You know, because I've wondered that over the years.  Yeah.  All those heart-shaped boxes in, like, the corner stores and stuff.  You know, they're not selling all of it.  No.  So they're just putting it in a box and waiting for next Valentine's Day.  I think that's what they do, just store it in the back room and then parade it out the next year.  They're absolutely doing it because they did some kind of undercover report, and they're finding out that some of this candy is a bit old.  Does it make a difference?  It's a bit old. 
[00:02:30]  With that candy?  I don't know.  Nah.  That's like the kind of cheapest candy.  Candy, what a heck of a gift.  Sorry, people.  I'm going to get her a small thing of candy, just a little bit, because she likes candy.  And I don't know what to get her.  I've got to get her a car, and I'll throw some crap on it.  What time are you leaving?  All my life without you, I now know what love is there.  What time are you leaving, Jimmy?  We have to leave at 1.30, so we're out.  We do this.  We're done with XM by 9.15 today, so I'm not all fucking... 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I got the place for you, for the candy, in our neighborhood, too.  Really?  I hope my girl's not up right now.  Oh.  That's not what you did.  Surprise, you're getting candy this year.  It would be hard if you gave too much candy.  If you gave, like, say $1,500 with the candy, like a hand truck full of candy.  Guys just suck.  Look, I wake up, and I turn on my BlackBerry, and there's a wonderful, wonderful email from 
[00:03:30]  my fiancée.  Yes, fiancée.  I'm reading it as she's, you know, out cold two feet, you know, two feet from me.  She planned it in advance and did it last night.  Yeah, she knew, like, I checked my BlackBerry for, like, you know, news and all that crap  before I go to work, and there it is.  An email from her as she's sleeping right next to me, and I read this wonderful thing.  All the things she likes about me, including my smelly, oh, I was going to say smelly underpants. 
[00:04:00]  My smelly sweats.  She even wrote it.  She even wrote that in there.  Holy gee.  What kind of drugs did you give her?  That she would like that.  She's just listing all these wonderful things she likes about me, and she goes, I even love  the fact that you have stinky sweatpants.  Wow.  I'm like, yeah, right on.  You're the one for me.  You hit the lotto.  Don't get it, man.  A ten who likes your dirty sweatpants.  How does that happen?  Yeah, there's got to be something wrong with her.  I'm going to find out what it is. 
[00:04:30]  If she's liking that.  You're going to walk in one day in the furniture, it's all going to be thrown out the window.  Right.  Screaming, I hate you.  Oh, I see.  Bipolar.  Bipolar.  Anyway, happy Valentine's Day to the people out there.  Actually, this is kind of weird for us, because usually we do the anti-Valentine's Day show  every year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I have no problem doing that still, because, oh boy, do I still have a lot of hate in my  heart.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  There's just percolating.  I'm not a big fan of the Valentine's Day thing.  I think it's kind of silly.  Yeah.  I know there are a lot of hopeless romantics out there that think there's something to  it, but you treat people, you treat your significant other nice all year.  There you go.  I think you're onto something.  I think an acknowledgement that it's Valentine's Day is good, obviously, but if you really want  to show that the girl you're with or the guy you're with, if you're a girl out there 
[00:05:30]  or if you're another guy out there and you've got a guy thing, whatever, whatever, yeah,  you've got to show them throughout the year.  Yeah.  That's what they really want.  The flowers unexpectedly.  Yeah.  But then they're going to look at you like, all right, you're obviously cheating on me  because you're bringing me flowers in August.  What's this about?  If you have to send the card that says, though I don't often say it enough, you know, those  I love those apologetic, I really can't stand you, but this day is special, so I have to 
[00:06:00]  make like a like you card.  Yeah.  I don't say it often enough.  Or I'm sorry for the fight we had.  Like they make these cards that are just custom made for just douches to try to look good on  one day, one day a year.  We're all just horrible people.  I mean, every single one of us, because we look at the cards and we're like, yeah, if  I was good at writing, I would have wrote that right there.  Yeah.  That's the one I would have wrote.  And then you get the card and then you kind of underline specific, like love always or 
[00:06:30]  forever.  You're just an underliner.  Yeah.  That's good.  And then as she's reading it and she's tearing up because it's someone else's words, you're  like, I really mean what this says.  I, uh, I'm, I'm starting to, to, uh, I'm attempting to like actually get the cards that have nothing  inside.  Nothing.  And then I'm just like, you, you, you, you, you do good in my life. 
[00:07:00]  You, you are special to me.  I just try to write crap in, in handwriting that like leans down as it goes.  You can't get the lines straight.  It's like a child wrote it.  It's so embarrassing.  With your horrible words.  And with me, I'd have to scratch out words because I misspelt it.  Wait, that's a C, not a K.  And then I wanted to like, I wanted to get a card where we're, where we're both like  kids.  Cause those are cool. 
[00:07:30]  Like the, you know, the, the guy is like dressed up as an adult and he's holding the  hand of a little, you know, a girl the same age and he's holding a rose.  Oh, the flower picture with the little kids on it.  And then I realized how creepy that is because like, I don't know when I was that age, I  don't know.  She was 10 years from being born.  So yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I can't be, she was the age of the girl on the card.  You were doing radio in Boston.  All right.  All right.  Well, listen, listen, it's not that bad, but it is bad. 
[00:08:00]  Kind of right.  I guess.  Yeah.  Cause I'm thinking, well, I could be a little kid and what I could be walking around with  an amoeba.  A zygote.  A zygote.  It happens.  What are you going to do?  That's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool to be in love on Valentine's day.  I'm panicking.  I don't, I got to get her something.  I got some, but I got a no brainer, Jimmy.  No brainer.  Is it just candy though?  I want to get her something else too.  Cause I think.  Um, it's, it's.  No, he's saying no brainer. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Like that, that, that creep did, uh, on the other side of town.  Oh, the, uh, the butcher of 79th street.  That's what they're calling them, huh?  We get some, uh, great crimes.  We really do.  You're in the city.  And they got surveillance footage of, uh, this guy, uh, basically for the rest of America.  Just sauntering past the doorman with his luggage full of death.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  And you know what?  He, he couldn't have enough death tools, by the way.  No.  Basically, he's seeing a psychologist on the upper East side, East 79th street for the 
[00:09:00]  people listening in this area.  And, uh, he went in and had his session and decided to take a cleaver, right?  Yeah.  A little meat cleaver.  He had all kinds of knives in the bag and, uh, a meat cleaver.  And he killed this, uh, actually it's a psychiatrist, which is different from a psychologist.  Mm-hmm.  One prescribes drugs and the other doesn't.  And the other one babbles.  And the other one babbles.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Shouldn't they just be the same person?  Bash.  You figure that out.  So, what did he have in, uh, in these, uh, duffel bags?  Well, he, uh, had, and they weren't even duffel bags. 
[00:09:30]  They were like roll-on luggage that wouldn't even fit in the overhead carry-on.  Like, it's a big wheelie luggage.  And then another, uh, shoulder bag, uh, apparently a bunch of knives, the meat cleaver, and, uh,  uh, adult diapers, duct tape, some rope, and women's clothing.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, every building in New York has these dopes downstairs that think they're going  to stop Al-Qaeda.  Useless guys, yeah.  Useless guys.  Uh, you know, it's an excuse to, to, I don't know, for fake building security, right? 
[00:10:00]  In this surveillance footage, there's, there's fake building security guy allowing this guy  to, you know, roll luggage by him.  Yep.  And he's not suspicious whatsoever.  The guy doesn't live in the building.  Didn't question him or anything.  The guy walked in, I think this doorman's probably going to be out of a job.  I disagree.  Oh, really?  This was probably one of her patients, and she probably had a, oh, what?  No.  Oh, a fan, fan, with a little fan action.  You read the article, Jimmy.  Oh. 
[00:10:30]  No, I think I heard the news guy say that.  Oh, my God, we're the worst radio show.  I read the first paragraph, and I think I know the whole story.  That's where you get all your news, people.  All I read is, the psycho, and I'm done.  Yeah.  I think he said he was going in to see another therapist in the building.  Really?  And that's how he got in.  Oh.  Maybe the therapists say, if anyone comes for me, just send them up.  They may not have to call.  How about, uh, do you have an appointment and having that down at the desk?  I mean, you're dealing with some unstable people, perhaps.  Sure, absolutely. 
[00:11:00]  Uh, well, he went up there, uh, gotten a little bit of, uh, an altercation with her,  hacked her up a little bit with a meat cleaver.  Another guy comes in, uh, one of her colleagues come in to try to help her.  He's now in serious condition in the hospital because the guy decided to start hacking at him.  And then, uh, he went down to the basement, left his luggage there, and walked out the back door.  And now what?  He's just wandering around out there?  They got a sketch of him that is amazing.  Yeah, the sketch is really, really good. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  Who the hell did this?  I think it's, uh, well, probably because they got his face on the, on the, uh, surveillance.  On the surveillance?  They probably zoomed in and did a pretty good job with this one.  Yeah, they'll, they'll get this guy in no time.  I mean, you got a great picture of him.  Yeah.  You got video.  You know the psychiatrist he was going to.  I mean, he's got to have some people that know who he is.  Uh, they'll get this guy pretty quickly, but, uh.  Yeah, we, we really do get the best freaking stories.  That's a good Valentine's Day story.  That's nice. 
[00:12:00]  Uh, the knives were.  Hard out.  Oh my God.  And, um, the knives, I know you're pointing at that, but the line before it is unbelievable.  The knives were bent from the sheer force of the attacks.  Yeah.  Even the cleaver had a dislodged handle and bent blade.  You could send those, uh, back if they're, uh, bent up like that because, uh, they're not supposed to bend.  They got a lifetime guarantee.  That's what I hear.  Uh, eight.  The smaller bag out of the two had eight steak knives, duct tape, and rope. 
[00:12:30]  The second had the women's clothing and diapers.  Police, uh, recovered the murder weapons.  Uh, the office looked like a butcher's shop.  Uh, blood covered everything, and furniture and books were tossed around as if a tornado.  Wow, that's gotta be a nasty scene.  Well, stop with as if a tornado hit.  Yeah.  If the tornado hit, there wouldn't be a roof.  And the desk would be up in Harlem.  Tornado of knives and meat cleavers.  Right, right.  Tornadoes never just leave one dead person bloody.  All cut up.  What was it? 
[00:13:00]  What was it?  A two-foot tornado?  Yeah, fit in her office.  Right.  Just squeezed through the door, did some damage, and went out the window.  It's a guilt-ridden tornado.  Sitting there trying to get some therapy.  Yeah.  Tornado diapers, so it doesn't poop all over its tornado pants.  That's a dumb analogy.  Uh, the knives are bent.  We said that.  Uh, the violence unfolded at 8 p.m.  when the killer walked into the building and told doorman Francisco, uh, Batista, Batista,  that he had an appointment with, uh, this, uh, this woman who was already with the, uh, 
[00:13:30]  female patient.  Whatever that.  Hmm.  I guess she was with another patient.  With a patient?  That's good.  I'll wait.  Oh, you, um.  Yeah, I'll wait to kill you.  Act apart.  You take care of, uh, her, and I'll, uh, I'll wait here.  Yeah.  So.  And then the poor patient, if he walks out, like, the guy who was in with before, and  he goes, oh, and she's like, we're on the brink of something, and he's like, I'll see  you next week.  I have a good feeling about this.  Yeah.  Finally going to get that memory out.  Yeah, that's some shrink, man.  Yeah.  First of all, uh, she, I guess, didn't do that good of a job of helping this guy out. 
[00:14:00]  Secondly, she's not too, um, perceptive at seeing that this guy perhaps might come in  with meat cleavers and, and hack her to pieces.  Yeah, that's why I don't think therapy really helps in the end.  I think it's like a little band-aid.  Some people it helps.  Some people it doesn't.  Well, she needs a little more than that now, eh?  You know, maybe it helps a little, but I mean, when, in these extreme cases, I mean,  please, just lock these, just lock these idiots up, please.  Why are they roaming around out there? 
[00:14:30]  All right.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.  That's great.  Just hack her.  Yesterday, we spent a lot of time on Obama, Clinton, and McCain, and, um, what I want to  say today, there's been a, there's, there's a battle going on with this show.  Jimmy and I are trying to convince Anthony.  That ain't gonna happen.  That Obama is the man, okay?  Now, for certain reasons, I could accept that.  And, and I think we got you wobbly yesterday, but then I think you, this is what I think  happens with Anthony, though.  Like, I, we, he was wobbling yesterday, a little bit, a little bit. 
[00:15:00]  But then I think he goes back to his, his abode, and gets with his people, and they make him  strong again.  My people.  Like Steve from Bayshore.  Yeah.  And, and, and they make you strong again, and then you're ready for the battle.  Yeah.  Uh, I gotta disagree with you on, you get me wobbly.  You were a little wobbly yesterday.  No, I, I was, I was understanding other people's points of view without, um, really getting  wobbly.  I understood the point that having Obama in as president would probably be interesting, 
[00:15:30]  uh, especially to comedians and, uh, radio personalities.  Yeah.  Uh, a lot of material, but as far as wanting him in there for the better of the country.  Oh, I didn't, oh, I didn't say we were anywhere near that.  Yeah.  I'm just saying we, we hit you with a few jabs and you got a little wobbly.  You said, uh, I might, uh, like him in there as a goof.  Yeah.  Okay.  That I might be able to live with.  I just want to be alive for a black president.  Simple as that.  But the point I want to make today, because this is like a, this is like a tug of war going 
[00:16:00]  on.  Yeah.  And I got to give Anthony a point today.  It kills me to say this, but Anthony's pulling the rope back toward, uh, toward himself as  far as I'm concerned.  And I'll tell you why.  Anthony pointed out today of a fine picture of, uh, uh, Barack Obama arm in arm with Reverend  Al Sharpton.  And I went, oh boy.  Yep.  Point for Anthony today.  Arm around him.  They're both at a podium.  Uh, what was this picture all about?  And laugh.  They're laughing.  It looks like Reverend Al's looking at something on his cell phone. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And they are just laughing and laughing.  It was at the Sheridan.  Cause I see the Sheridan logo.  So we're going to some kind of rally.  Put a picture of tub girl on his blackberry.  Two girls, one cup.  Hey, look at this one, Barack.  So, uh, that doesn't make me happy seeing a picture.  Any, any entertaining of, uh, Reverend Al's charlatan.  Uh, as Bob Grant, uh, called him, uh, it, to me is, uh, reprehensible that this guy is 
[00:17:00]  look at it.  Look at the picture.  He has his arm around him.  Obama's got his arm around Reverend Al at the podium.  And I don't care when this was taken, what the context is or anything.  There he is with a race baiting, uh, racist, intimidator, Al Sharpton.  I'm with you.  I don't like the fact that these two together, man. 
[00:17:30]  I'll tell you, Jimmy, I'll tell you why it doesn't matter to me.  It's all part of the game in the sense that there's plenty of pictures of any Republican  candidate with, with even the most hardcore religious conservative.  It's, it's like Sharpton's a douche and everybody knows that he's a small fringe.  Um, and he's just, he's just another player in that game.  Let me tell you something then though.  I'll, I'll, I'll react to what you just said.  If there's a, uh, uh, Republican who is there with a real hardline religious right, uh, and  he's got his arm around him, that's fine and dandy. 
[00:18:00]  But I'll tell you one thing, a liberal or Democrat isn't going to look at that picture  and go, Oh, I'll vote for him.  So I, I see your point, but I'm going to look at that picture and go, there's no way  I'm voting for him.  Just as it would be the other way around.  If somebody saw a Republican with a religious right wing nut, uh, and had his arm around  him, they would point that out as being, look at this guy's in cahoots with, uh, with  him.  Look, man, I said, you got me a little bit.  You got me with a little jab.  I'm, you know, this picture isn't a knockout punch. 
[00:18:30]  I still say Obama.  Hey, look, but you'll see, this scares me a little bit.  Yeah, well, you'll see a little bit, a little bit.  If he's elected, you'll see pictures of him holding hands with a Saudi Arabian, uh, guy.  None of that matters to me.  And so that's all part of the game.  It's like, what is he going to say to Sharpton?  No.  Sharpton shouldn't be entertained at all.  I agree with you.  I agree.  But if you're running for something and you want people to be motivated to go out and vote,  this is one more guy, especially the, uh, uh, black vote he's going to get anyway.  Does he need, I know, does he need Reverend Al Sharpton?  He might be able to get people to register to vote who might not be likely to, because he talks 
[00:19:00]  to a segment of the population.  You know what, they're certainly able to vote, and a lot of them may feel disenfranchised  and not, I mean, there might be a reason for it.  Well, if I was a guy that was considering, and I'm on the fence, uh, about voting for  Barack Obama, uh, a picture like that speaks volumes.  I don't want him in cahoots with the likes of a Reverend Al Sharpton.  Only half of them would be.  Yeah, well, yeah, let's say hi to Ron. 
[00:19:30]  What's up, Ron?  What's up, Bopey?  We got, we got to talk.  Yeah.  Um, do you realize that you could say more negative things about Obama that you know  than positive things that you know?  You know he's Al Sharpton, and you know that he was, you know, he was happy that Imus got  in trouble with what he said.  And, and you know nothing positive, so you know nothing.  Well, we pointed out that, that whole Imus thing yesterday.  Uh, yes, Obama agreed with the firing of Imus, which, which affects us greatly, obviously.  But, uh, I think Jimmy brought it up, and no matter who's in the White House, they're 
[00:20:00]  all going to agree with the firing of Imus.  Right.  So, you know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to win on every point with, uh, with the guy  I want in the White House.  You know what, buddy?  And this one, you got to just give it to everybody.  None of them, uh, look at us favorably, favorably.  Even though, my, my, my point, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  No, no, go ahead, buddy.  My, my, my point was that now you see this guy with, with a picture of Al Sharpton, and  you're like, oh, he's still my guy.  But you don't know one good thing he's done for anybody. 
[00:20:30]  I just like how he talks, and like Chris Matthews said, I was reading an article about  Chris Matthews after Obama talked, after he did a fine job the other night, uh, Chris  Matthews said, wow, I, I, I'm, I'm actually getting wobbly in the legs.  This guy is inspirational.  Swooning.  It's like, uh, the old Sinatra.  Where was it?  I think it was on Drudge Report.  I want to get the Chris Matthews, uh, quotes, because he, he had some, and they actually made  fun of him.  It was giddy like a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Giddy like a girl.  He, what, what did they say?  He had a tingle in his legs after Obama talked. 
[00:21:00]  Jesus.  People love this guy and how he's talking.  There's something very galvanizing about him, and, um, the fact that he's with,  Char, is meaning, if you look back over campaign pictures, I think of all candidates, you're  going to find a few of them with people that you go, they are in cahoots with that dirt  bag.  It's just the way it is in politics.  I, uh, Reverend Al is inexcusable.  Uh, I understand the politicians, uh, you know, especially you can't take pictures with  certain people and have them go away. 
[00:21:30]  I mean, there's pictures.  There's, what's that famous picture of, uh, who is it?  Dick Cheney shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.  Um, oh no, Rumsfeld.  Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.  Well, Saddam was at one point, uh, an ally of the United States in the war with Iran.  So the times change, but Reverend Al has always been a reprehensible racist that there was never  a time you could take a picture with him and say, well, it was when he was a legitimate, 
[00:22:00]  uh, upstanding, uh, man who was just there for the better of, of our, our, our nation or  our state or no, he's got an agenda and his agenda is Al Sharpton and, uh, race baiting  because that keeps him in business.  Uh, racism, racism in this country keeps Reverend Al in business and, uh, Barack Obama entertaining  him in any way is, uh, inexcusable to me.  He has to do it though.  No, he doesn't. 
[00:22:30]  He has to.  He's doing fine without Reverend Al.  What I'm saying is that might've just been at a podium.  Like they literally may have just been at an event together and he can't be rude to him.  I mean, then don't put your arm around him.  There's, there's, there's no reason for it to be, there's no reason for him not to.  I know what you're saying, but it's like, that doesn't mean anything to me.  That photo.  And you know what?  Uh, S happens.  Let's be honest.  Does it?  Yeah.  We were at a, uh, we were at a roast and S happens.  You, you, you took a picture with Artie Lang. 
[00:23:00]  So, I mean, some people would say that's not a good thing.  Well, uh, I'll, I'll be honest.  It just happens.  I mean, come on.  I'll be honest.  I, I find.  Now I have no problem with this Reverend Al Sharpton.  Artie's funny.  I have no guys.  He's a, he's a funny comedian.  I have no problem with the Reverend Al Sharpton picture now because I forgot that you had no  problem taking a picture with Artie.  You could have easily said no.  So, it happens.  I mean, come on.  I got a picture with Sharpton and I hate him.  I have a great picture. 
[00:23:30]  I'm not voting for you either.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  It's a Valentine's day.  Yeah.  Our phone number is 877-212-ONA.  Lots to do today.  We got, um, we got the Clemens audio.  Oof.  Oh boy.  Wow.  I guess we can talk about that a little bit after the break, huh?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:24:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton was dressed and ready to go to San Francisco.  I see you and Kenny have like matching hoodies on.  That way we don't get lost in the airport.  Our traveling virus, uh, sheepskin, the sheep thing.  It's an awesome hoodie.  Here's the problem though.  Kenny's 6'5".  You guys are going to be walking through the airport, you know, with the same hoodie on.  It's going to look like, uh, this is dangerous to say and I'm sorry.  I have to say sorry before I say this, but it's going to look like you're bringing your, 
[00:24:30]  your older retarded brother on a little trip.  Think like Rain Man.  246.  Okay.  Here's the, here's the gate number.  I'm going to look just like my brother.  Hot water burned baby.  You guys leave right after the show, huh?  Qantas. 
[00:25:00]  You know, Qantas never crashed.  Yeah, I'm doing Cobbs this weekend.  It's tonight, tomorrow, I'm sorry, tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday for the holiday weekend.  So if you're out in San Francisco, 415-928-4320.  I love that city, man.  Yeah.  I love San Francisco.  You do?  Yeah.  It's great.  You ever been there?  No, I haven't.  I'm afraid of it.  It's as liberal a place as you can be.  That's why I'm scared.  It's, it's too bad it gets the whole, the whole gay moniker. 
[00:25:30]  No, it's not even for the gay rap.  I don't care about that.  That's, that's enjoyable.  Well, it's, it's just the whole liberal, like really, I think the city, I think all the  straight people in San Francisco are, are in cahoots with each other.  Like, look, let's get the word out that this place is like just flaming gay and we'll have  this place to ourselves.  And then people won't, uh, because I went out there and I was scared of them.  I'll be honest.  I was scared of that, that, and, and you, you walk around and you're like, this, what,  this is just a regular city. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, not even a regular city.  People bent over fire hydrants on the street.  They do a pretty good job promoting the fact that it's a gay city.  You would think, yeah, it would be just in your face everywhere, but it just wasn't.  The problem is the buildings all have the same top shape like Taj Mahal.  I think they got together the tours for it and said, look, let's, let's make sure that  the word gets out that this is flaming and we'll have the, this fine area to ourselves  for the most part.  It's an amazing city.  It's ridiculous how cool it is. 
[00:26:30]  And, uh, the women are probably, uh, not even probably, I've been around, you know,  when we, uh, when we were off the radio for two years, I visited a lot of cities in the  country.  The best looking women in the country are in San Francisco, believe it or not.  I know.  That sounds crazy.  I disagree.  What?  You're going to say what?  Bayshore?  Long Island?  No, I'll, I'll say, um, LA.  Probably.  It's not LA because they're, oh, God, right?  Jimmy, Jimmy, uh, brings up a point.  Miami Beach. 
[00:27:00]  Miami Beach beats San Francisco.  Yeah.  You can't argue that.  Can I tell you what the best looking women I saw?  Again, that might've just been because I was only there for a short team.  It was in Phoenix because they're very healthy out there.  Very healthy air, healthy living.  I, everyone I saw, I wanted to just jump on.  Yeah.  Everyone.  Every chick.  They were just great.  Really?  Phoenix, Arizona.  Phoenix.  They were beautiful.  That's right.  Arizona was, uh, yeah.  San Francisco's not like that, though.  It's a really weird, it's like, uh, I'm staying downtown.  The Fisherman's Wharf is where the club is, but at night it's just like a little, like, 
[00:27:30]  eh, kind of dicey.  I'm going to be downtown.  It's a good city, man.  It's dicey.  Everyone's wearing leather jackets with studs on them.  Yeah.  Hey.  Uh, so San Francisco this weekend.  Hey, uh, you've done the Alcatraz, right?  Oh yeah.  Last time I was out there.  Okay.  I thought we went, yeah.  It was fun.  Go up into Coit's Tower or Coit Tower.  What is that?  Ah, just a tower. 
[00:28:00]  Tower.  Oh, that tower at the top of the hill?  It's a skinny tower.  Yeah, it just sits there.  You look at it.  You're like, ah, there it goes.  Let's get out of here.  It's a landmark out there.  Coit Tower or Coit's Tower or something like that.  I don't know.  We went to Berkeley.  Like, they're talking about the most liberal place on earth.  We went to Berkeley because that's where her mom lives.  I want to check out Berkeley.  It's okay.  Just because of The Graduate.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  You know, Richard Dreyfuss has a moment in that.  Richard Dreyfuss is in The Graduate?  He has one line in it.  It's when Norman Fell, who played Mr. Roper, is ready to throw Dustin Hoffman out. 
[00:28:30]  And Richard Dreyfuss is like, I'll call the cops.  He just pokey's like, oh, that's right.  That's his line?  Yes.  Five and under.  He has like a one line.  Holy crap, yeah.  Jimmy's right.  You know that movie's 40 years old?  Wow.  Came out in 67, 68, something like that.  Opie, you sure you don't mean twins with Arnold and Danny DeVito?  Jason from Columbus.  Ah, that's true.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, moving on.  So we were talking just before the break about Chris Matthews loving Obama.  We found the clip.  Everyone is just getting caught up in the fact that this guy's a good speaker. 
[00:29:00]  He's a great public speaker.  Listen to Chris Matthews.  It's worth playing.  It's quick.  I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election.  The feeling most people get when they hear a Barack Obama speech, I felt this thrill going up my leg.  I mean, I don't have that too often.  Steady.  No, seriously.  It's a dramatic event.  He speaks about America in a way that has nothing to do with politics.  It has to do with the feeling we have about our country.  And that is an objective assessment. 
[00:29:30]  He likes to get something up his leg.  He likes to get a bob.  A little creepy.  I got a trickle.  Look, I don't want to say anything, but I heard him speak.  It filled up a little.  Yeah.  He talks so good.  I felt so pro-American, it filled up.  You imagine if a guy spoke so well, he just looked down and went, I can't believe it.  Wow.  How is that happening from this gentleman speaking? 
[00:30:00]  Do, sir, have the gift of gab.  We're working on a bit, and maybe we should throw this at the listeners, maybe, because  we've got some very talented people that listen to the show.  We're trying to do something with Obama's inspirational words and Anthony's rants about the same, about  Obama.  We're trying to, like, juxtaposition something that'll make you, the listener, laugh your  asses off.  Like it.  We're just not there yet, though.  But we're on to something.  I really conceptualized it yesterday, though, so after the show. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, actually, yeah.  Jimmy, you know, came up with it in the bathroom as we were taking leaks next time.  Ooh, nice.  I mean, you don't do a lot of our show talking right there.  After, like, a while, you look good.  You, too.  But Jimmy has this weird thing where he kind of, like, leans away from the urinal a little  too much.  Yeah.  It makes me a little uncomfortable.  No, I don't peak.  Don't worry.  No, I'm not even saying that you peak.  It's just like, I don't know.  I'm a bigger boy than you think.  He's got to back away.  Here's just a couple quick clips of Obama. 
[00:31:00]  Today.  Here we go.  The change we seek.  Boo.  Swept through Chesapeake and over the Potomac.  We won the state of Maryland.  We won the Commonwealth of Virginia.  We won the Commonwealth of Virginia.  And though we won in Washington, D.C., this movement won't stop until there's change in 
[00:31:30]  Washington, D.C.  And tonight, we're on our way.  Sounds like a victory speech from a general that's moved his troops into those states.  No kidding.  No kidding.  We have a victory.  And we're coming for you.  Oh, God.  That's the Obama train.  You can't stop this thing.  Oh, no.  As far as getting the nomination, it's done.  It's so done.  Yeah, I do think he'll get it.  We're on our way. 
[00:32:00]  But we know how much further we have to go.  We know it takes more than one night or even one election to overcome decades of money and  the influence.  The bitter partisanship.  Was I hearing that?  Shut you out.  Mm-hmm.  Let you down.  Told you to settle.  We know our road will not be easy.  But we also know that at this moment, the cynics can no longer say that our hope is false. 
[00:32:30]  We have now won east and west, north and south, and across the heartland of this country.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, help me.  Yeah, we should have had some of this evil war music in the background.  Gee, was he.  North, south, east, west, the heartland.  I don't leave much.  I don't leave much.  You can't even.  For Whitey.  You can't even hide in Maine, my friend.  I can't even hide in Maine. 
[00:33:00]  You won Maine, so you can't even go up there.  Let me.  Wait.  Yeah.  Oh, Canada.  No, I don't like that either.  It's too cold for you up there.  You got to think Mexico.  Yeah.  You got to go to Mexico.  Or maybe go to Hawaii.  Why?  It's still the U.S.?  Yeah, is it?  Is it really?  That's what they say.  Look at the map.  It doesn't make sense.  I don't want to go to stupid Europe.  I don't want to go to Australia. 
[00:33:30]  How the hell is Alaska part of the United States?  We bought it from the Russians.  I understand that, but you look at a map, it doesn't make sense.  It's way away.  And too much land in between.  Why didn't we take all the land in between?  Yeah.  Like, just a whole big swath of Canada.  Right.  We should have taken the entire west coast of Canada.  Probably could have got a penny a mile.  I'm sure.  I mean, real cheap.  It really is a stupid state.  We have a peaceful...  Shut up.  Give me some lamp oil. 
[00:34:00]  Eskimos are part of our country.  That's weird.  Make yourself a snow hat, idiot.  Make a hat out of snow.  Don't know why your head's cold.  It's frozen.  I know.  You have a hat made of snow.  It's a snow hat.  Silly.  Stick your head...  Cut a seal's belly open and put your head in and think you'll look fashionable in your  seal's blubber hat.  We eat sushi.  They eat blubber.  They should not be part of us.  Do they really?  I'd love to know that. 
[00:34:30]  They're sitting down at a sizzler up there.  No, they're not.  No.  They're on a TGI Friday.  Everyone in Alaska lives in an igloo.  Right.  They rub noses.  When they kiss you.  And what else do we know?  And they eat blubber.  They eat blubber.  They gargle with it.  They love blubber.  They just can't get enough blubber.  For a big day to liquefy blubber and you go, argh.  They got horrendous breath because the blubber's stuck between their teeth.  It's rotting.  You got to floss that blubber out.  You don't have time to floss when you're living in sub-zero temperatures. 
[00:35:00]  Old blood breath.  Cake.  You ever smell someone's breath if they have dental work?  They have caked blood on their teeth?  You want to talk about food pockets.  Theirs are filled with just rotting blubber.  Root canal breath.  Right.  That's all we know about them.  And they use like harpoons and stuff.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But they're trying to ban harpoons though.  Are they?  Yeah.  Because like, I don't know, Eskimo children are bringing them to school and, you know,  doing horrible things. 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  Is that how they have their school, it's the equivalent of a school shooting?  Well, that's what we get.  Little Eskimo children go in and just harpoon each other.  Thank you for figuring out the brilliance of me.  But there's only one killing at a time.  Yes.  How many classmates can you pick off of the harpoon?  You have to get them on the lunch line.  Don't move.  I have to pull it out of him and hit you.  What else do we know about them in Alaska?  Don't, just don't step on my blubber cakes.  They're a treat that children love here.  They all have like blubber cupcakes. 
[00:36:00]  Rice Krispies blubber treats.  Thanksgiving today, they're going to have like little heart-shaped blubber candies.  Little pieces of blubber with chocolate.  Yes.  Shaved like hearts.  I bet you they don't even have Thanksgiving on the same day we do.  Did I just say Thanksgiving?  Yeah, but that's good, Jimmy.  Valentine's Day.  Yeah, but I was going with the bid.  I think they don't even know when Thanksgiving is.  They're so close.  Not in touch.  They've got to be thankful for.  Well, we live in a tundra.  There's to it.  It's a whole country down there that's warm. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  And we live up here.  Why?  Everything we have is made from a walrus and a seal.  Great.  Thanks.  That whole summer.  Oh, it's a balmy seven.  I don't think the indigenous people of Alaska consider themselves Americans.  I'm just my opinion.  I'm not.  I think it's the workers up there.  The guys that go up to the pipeline and stuff like that.  They're they're Americans.  They make a lot of money.  I saw from what I hear. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  But it's really a drag to try to get girls.  You want to you want to hear summer in real time?  Yeah.  Yay.  It's summer.  Oh, it's winter again.  Burr.  Burr.  How I spent my summer vacation.  I walked to the store once.  But not back.  It was winter by the time I got back.  How did I spend my summer vacation?  Yeah.  I took the dog for a short walk.  Then it got cold. 
[00:37:30]  What a stupid place.  Give it back to the Ruskies.  How do I spend my summer vacation?  I skated on the ice on a lake.  All right.  We get it, Jim.  It's cold.  Yeah, we are the worst.  All right.  We're going to be.  You know, I talked to somebody and I can't remember who this was.  Yeah.  But they actually thought Alaska was off the coast of Texas because the map, you know how they have a map and you got to get it on one page. 
[00:38:00]  And they usually put Alaska in the Gulf of Mexico.  Right.  And Hawaii off the coast of California.  But don't they have like the dash, dash, dash.  Oh, it didn't.  Dashes didn't matter.  Really?  Yes.  Let me look at the map now.  The person thought that Alaska was off the coast of Texas.  And there it is.  And thought Hawaii was off of California.  Where's Hawaii in this map?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hawaii.  Oh, there it is.  No, Hawaii is in the Gulf of Mexico.  Wait.  Gulf of Mexico is on which side? 
[00:38:30]  No.  Is it?  Yeah.  The Gulf of Mexico is on the right.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  The Gulf of California is on the left.  Right.  Is that where Hawaii is?  Yeah.  Hawaii is.  Hawaii, according to this map, is in between southern Texas and Alaska.  Uh-huh.  Which is, and Alaska is just south of California.  Yeah.  So it's warm.  Uh, it's very small.  I thought it was a lot bigger than Texas, but it seems to be pretty tiny.  Who was this person that thought that?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Uh, I just remember hearing it. 
[00:39:00]  It's a story, uh, uh, yeah, given to me, but, um, I couldn't remember.  Right.  Let's say hi to Lydia from, uh, Oceanside, a regular to this show, unfortunately.  Lydia, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I was just afraid that you were worried that I was the one that got chopped off on the  Upper East Side.  Uh, no, actually, we told Kenny to get rid of the balloons and the, and the, uh, noisemakers  when we found out it wasn't you.  Nothing.  Poor Lydia.  That's just mean.  She's a nice lady. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, Lydia, do you know anything about, uh, this?  Like, like, why is this guy, uh, coming in for some therapy with, like, um, uh, depends,  adult diapers and women's clothing?  I, I have no idea.  I didn't get to hear much about the story.  It's been a crazy week, but, uh, people are crazy.  Well, he had, um, he had a bag full of knives and diapers, which might have meant that he  planned on cooking something that took a lot of stirring.  No? 
[00:40:00]  Well, I was implying that he was stirring for so long that he wouldn't be able to take  bathroom breaks.  Lydia, why was it a busy week?  Uh, my family.  Nothing very interesting.  Okay.  I have, uh, I have small twin boys who've been, uh, sick.  Any, uh, people, um, you know, you think might hack your part or something?  I'm sorry, could you say that again?  No.  No.  I said it once.  You know what?  We gotta cut our losses.  Sorry, guys.  Bye. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  There goes Lydia from Oceanside.  Nothing today.  Anthony in New York, what's up?  Although I would like to have heard the answer to that if she had any patients that might  hack her to death.  Yeah, that might hack her to death.  Because I went to therapy yesterday, and I wanted to ask my therapist, like, I didn't,  like, does that scare you?  Like, you have all these people coming in here.  They're kind of kooky.  Yeah.  Some of them more so than others, and there is no real protection.  No.  Uh, you're locked in there pretty much alone, because that's how it works.  Yeah, they can do anything.  Hmm.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Well, I mean, uh, it is scary.  I'm just watching hard-hitting news.  I'm sorry.  Apparently, they got the Hawaiian Tropic Girls on, uh, our Channel 11, a quote, unquote,  news.  Mm-hmm.  Just in time for Valentine's Day.  That must be what it is.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to Anthony in New York.  Anthony, uh, heading toward a break, what do you got?  Um, well, we're hanging out.  Hey, not you!  But you said in New York.  Never any Eskimo porn.  Yeah, Jimmy, you know anything about that? 
[00:41:30]  You're an expert on the porn thing.  No Eskimo porn.  Good question.  What's that about?  Because when they're filming it, the camera always gets, like, those little frosted things  that lens get on it.  It's all crystal-y and frosted.  And plus, certain things freeze in mid-air before they hit the girl's face.  So it just looks like her mouth is open waiting for icicles.  It looks like little blubber tidbits.  Blubber nibs.  It never hits her face.  Just stops right short of her face. 
[00:42:00]  I think it's stuck together.  It just goes to show you how great sex is, by the way.  Why?  Well, with all that clothing and igloos and all that crap around, you're still figuring  out how to get it done, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess people are doing it.  Of course they are.  Because there are no houses up there or anything, I'm sure.  It's just igloos.  Well, there's been Eskimo porn, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that chatter dirty to me?  How's it going? 
[00:42:30]  People are saying, I don't know where the Gulf of Mexico is.  Well, I do, but I got confused because Ant was showing me the map, and it kind of looked  like they were, like, dueling coasts around Mexico.  Because the map we saw, you've got Alaska right there.  Well, that's the confusion.  Getting off where California sort of is.  It's the confusion of having Alaska right off the coast of California.  Right.  And I got confused when I saw that, because it looked like a couple different coasts down  there.  Yeah.  I mean, it would have been very funny to put this person on a plane and tell them they 
[00:43:00]  were going to Alaska.  Right.  And them wondering why it's taking so long.  Right.  All right.  Debbie does Juno.  That was a good one.  Just her in a bar, 10 feet of snow outside, being attacked by locals with pool sticks.  Poor Deb.  She just went to cheerlead.  And they realized they have no football team or sports team.  Look, it's the Alaskan seal kickers.  They won't allow us into the league. 
[00:43:30]  Their helmet.  It's a football helmet.  It just has a foot with a sand seal being kicked on it.  Those big eyes and a big steel tip boot.  They can't get any sponsorships.  That's our theme today.  Stupid Alaska and stupid Eskimos.  It's going to continue after the break.  Let me plop my knee rock on the porn music as I was doing a football joke.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like five minutes after the porn material.  All right. 
[00:44:00]  Let's take a break.  Oh, we should remind people.  You got a chance to win $2,000.  We're having a lot of fun with the animations.  Coke Logic, he takes a bit from the show and he animates it.  And they've been very successful.  A bunch of them are on onaradio.com.  They're also available on iTunes.  But people can't find them on iTunes.  I saw that on Instant Feedback this morning.  It's right in the podcast section, right?  Just search Opie and Anthony.  Search what?  You go to iTunes?  iTunes, the iStore, and just search Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, there's a search thing right there.  So then maybe that guy has a problem. 
[00:44:30]  Come on, people.  I got an email yesterday from someone.  And she's like, congratulations on the iTunes thing.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  And she's like, I opened it up and there was like a thing.  Best of Jim Norton.  It's obviously with the O&A show.  So there's obviously a section for the program.  There's a bunch of them.  And the cool thing is you don't have to pay anything for the downloads.  No.  That's right.  You'll see why once you hear them.  We're just dumb.  We could be making money off all this stuff.  And we just don't.  We're stupid.  Actually, we're smart. 
[00:45:00]  We'd like to give you guys some stuff.  Freebies.  Anyway, we're going to do an animation contest.  So what we're looking for is an original animated bit from our show.  What you can do is go to onaradio.com for all the details.  Courtesy of Be Kind Rewind starring Jack Black.  You name it.  We shoot it in theaters February 26th.  22nd.  Excuse me.  A week from tomorrow.  So just go to onaradio.com if you want to win $2,000.  And you're kind of good at animation for all the details.  Okay?  Right.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, more next. 
[00:45:30]  Good morning.  Holy crap.  Will people please listen to the entire show?  What happened?  That would be good for us.  Dan in New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  What's up?  Wanted to let you know about our left.  There's nowhere near the coast of California. 
[00:46:00]  It's actually attached to Canada all the way up north.  Is it?  Really?  Yeah.  Because I looked at a map.  They show it like that.  They show it like that on the American map.  Really?  Nowhere near America.  Why?  Because.  They put it in a separate little box.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.  And now we're confused.  You mean to tell me?  Because I looked at a map.  I'm looking at one right now.  And Alaska is right off the coast of California on this map.  It's clear as day, sir.  It's right there. 
[00:46:30]  Look at that.  Huh?  Look at a map of the world, though.  And you're saying that where is it?  It's up north right off of attached to Canada.  Yeah, but.  You see the right side of Alaska?  See how flat it is?  Yeah.  I just thought that was like erosion from the ocean because it's off California.  He said it's straight because it's.  Dan, you must have a different map than us because the one we see, it's clear as day.  It's kind of off the southern part of California right there. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, Dan, get your facts straight before you call up because we're looking at a map right now.  Is it a map of the world?  Huh?  No, it's a map of the United States.  Yeah, we don't need a map of the world.  And Hawaii is in between Alaska and Mexico, clear as day right there.  A few nice islands that you can kind of hang out and go on vacation.  That's why it's warm.  Yeah.  You're wrong.  What?  That's why what's warm.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Dan, get your facts straight. 
[00:47:30]  Two words for Dan.  What are you talking about?  Two words for Dan.  Linger longer.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  How does it happen that someone would call up and really think we mean that?  I don't know.  Holy mother of pearl.  Why even bother?  We got to get into some material.  We got Roger Clemens.  We got a guy with a nail in his penis.  We got.  Ow.  Can he say that?  I mean, it's a story.  Please don't dump out of that.  Is the nail.  All right.  What do you got over there, Jimmy, as I set up the Clemens crap here?  Oh, I tell you what I don't have. 
[00:48:00]  What?  A nail in my penis.  Well, thank goodness for that, because it could be fatal from what the doctors were  saying about this story.  The story is a very short story.  A Bahrainian doctor successfully removed a nail from a man's penis.  Doctors successfully removed a two-inch nail from an Indian man's genitals after he admitted  himself to a hospital due to abdominal pain and the inability to speak. 
[00:48:30]  It was so unpleasant.  They're like, what's wrong?  All you do is point and go, ah!  I will give Pat Duffy $200.  An x-ray of the man who was not identified showed the nail lodged in his urethra.  The victim claimed that the nail had been inserted by a gang of thieves who attacked and robbed  him three days earlier.  Doctors said the victim would have been dead if they had not acted sooner.  They do that, those thieves, man. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, watch out for the thieves.  But at what point...  They take a nail, a little tiny hammer, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.  How sick are you, though?  You're stealing somebody's iPod and then, you know, ah, before I leave, you're hammering  in a nail.  I think he's lying.  Oh, I don't know about that.  He may have.  They say to make matters worse, the victims and illegal workers could face deportation.  So he very well may have been robbed, which, here's a word of advice.  If they're robbing you and you're saying, I'm not telling you where the loot is, and 
[00:49:30]  they line the nail up with the penis, they pull the hammer back, you go, all right, all  right.  Okay.  Take anything you want.  I'm with Anthony.  I think it was some wild sex play.  Could have been.  Now he has to come up with the crazy excuse, because it's embarrassing.  Why wait two days?  Remember the story of the guy, let's just put it this way, he sat down or fell from a ladder.  Yeah, fell from a ladder.  What ended up in his you-know-what, because he fell from a ladder, and this is what they 
[00:50:00]  told the emergency room?  Well, they had to remove a basketball trophy, I believe it was.  Was that the one?  Yeah.  Because there's another one with a doorknob.  It was one doing a, like a foul shot.  Yeah, the one-arm raised.  Yeah, the one-arm raised shot, and you can't go to the emergency room and tell what really  happened.  You've got to come up with a crazy excuse.  There was another one with a doorknob.  Somehow the guy fell down onto a doorknob.  A doorknob.  People are always falling, and their clothes, I don't know where their clothes are, but. 
[00:50:30]  I think there was one where the guy was changing a light bulb.  He was, yeah, I think it was, he was changing, help us out, Iraq, try to find the story.  I've fallen a few times.  But I'm not naked.  But never, never, I've even slipped maybe coming out of the shower a little bit.  You can do that little, whoa, whoa thing.  But never in any danger of anything like that happening, where I have to go to the hospital  being very embarrassed.  Yes.  Well, at least it was, thank God it was a basketball trophy with the one arm during the  foul shot.  Because you'd hate to think it was a victory in a race, where the trophy has the two-arms 
[00:51:00]  raised.  Because then you'd be in real trouble, wouldn't you, sir?  You know what?  But pretty impressive, though.  You've got to give him.  Wow, yeah.  Quite impressive, sir.  Well, depending on how good he was, if it was second place, not as impressive, smaller  trophy, but that was a first place victory.  Congratulations.  And hopefully he didn't win the MVP in the Super Bowl.  Because that's a tough one.  It sure is.  Thank God he didn't win the World Cup. 
[00:51:30]  Look at the trophy for the joke.  Bill, what's up?  Nail in the penis.  Gay or funny?  Oh, man.  So funny.  Yeah, that's funny.  That is just completely funny.  Ming-a-longer!  Ming-a-longer!  He might be telling the truth, though.  He might be.  Who are we to judge, right?  Hey, speaking of sports...  Roger Clemens.  Was it C-SPAN?  Uh, one of those boring political, uh, channel hearing, hearings channels. 
[00:52:00]  People are saying it was great TV.  I was reading, I think Hinkley was saying today that it was great TV.  It was like reality TV.  It was a lot of fun to watch, but wow, what a bore fest in between the good stuff.  Of course.  I finally had to turn it off and go back to...  Blah, blah, blah.  Go back to some Omaha online.  Ooh.  I know.  I don't know why I don't just play Hold'em.  Omaha is just...  Omaha is for, like, eight-year-olds.  Yeah, Hold'em.  I'm playing an eight-year-old card game online.  Hold'em's a man's game.  For no cash, by the way.  I get excited winning points.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Which is...  I'm just stupid.  I owe Sonny Forelli 50 bucks.  Yeah.  I made a side bet on Pest Poker Sunday night.  I lost.  Now I owe him...  And the room itself was like a cheap room.  Right.  It was like $5 or something like that.  Yeah.  And I had to make a $50 side bet.  Now I owe that Boston ass.  Make him drive down from Boston on his motorcycle to pick up the fifth.  Yeah.  I'm not sending it to him.  Screw him.  Give it to him and roll coins.  Don't throw them at him.  We're doing a coin bit in the very near future. 
[00:53:00]  I can't wait.  We're going to do a cleavage...  I forgot the name of it, but basically we're going to have girls well-endowed coming in.  And we're going to pour, like, coins into their cleavage.  And as much coins that their cleavage could hold, they get to walk away with.  All righty.  Wow.  Hope they're Susan B. Anthony Dollars.  Pennies.  I think they could squish them together, whatever they have to do.  But as much coinage, they could get in their cleavage. 
[00:53:30]  And they could build a mountain of coins up.  Yeah.  We're still working on the rules of the game.  Mechanics of it.  You have to let them push it together.  I mean, no one just standing there with their breasts hanging.  He's going to be able to pick up a lot of chains.  No.  Yeah.  I got $1.30, thank you.  We're doing it in two weeks.  Two weeks from, I believe, tomorrow.  Yes.  Or, no, 27th?  Okay, it's the 27th.  You do the math at home.  Here's Roger Clemens at the Congress hearing thing yesterday. 
[00:54:00]  Some quick highlights.  Thank you for allowing me to tell you a little bit about myself and how I've conducted my professional career over the past 25 years.  I'll see you all.  I've always believed that hard work and determination were the only ways to be successful.  I was wrong.  It reads goals.  Shortcuts are not enough.  This was instilled in me since I was a young boy by my mother and my grandmother.  Along with human growth hormones.  I can't remember.  He's just reading that. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It's just dumb.  Prepared statement.  Lawyer craps that you have to read.  Hard work and determination.  Shut up.  We demand an apology, Senator.  Just make a big scene.  I was in the XDA's business with his father.  Now, I have to go, but I want to say that many baseball players are good people and a few bad apples shouldn't spoil it for all of them.  It was between the pitchers, Kay. 
[00:55:00]  How about some Godfather music there?  That's what they're doing.  Can you identify that man sitting over there?  Yes, that's Rolly Fingers.  He brought in to support Clemens.  Well, you know, the whole Yankee dugout was excited.  I think you should be heard.  Louder with the music, please.  We can actually hear ourselves talking at this point. 
[00:55:30]  Were there any buffers between the doctor, the syringe, and Clemens' ass?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buffers.  Lots of buffers.  I love it.  I don't like you or your whole greasy pitching staff.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  Thank you.  They'll go back to it.  You can.  This is what Clemens thinks of steroids.  What do you think?  Three minutes earlier.  Clemens?  Yes.  Clemens?  The Jaws music from the Roy Scheider death.  Yeah.  Clemens thinks steroids are blank.  Ah.  Good.  Overpriced.  Do I think steroids are good for helping someone's performance?  No.  You're a liar.  They are detrimental.  These types of drugs should play no role in the game of baseball.  Goddamn liar. 
[00:56:30]  Stop it.  Should there be more extensive testing?  Goddamn man.  I think whatever's necessary for everyone involved to satisfy themselves that is not going on  should be done.  I've been accused of something I'm not guilty of.  How do you prove a negative?  What?  This bastard's convincing man.  No he's not.  He's saying the things I would say.  I've been accused of something I'm not guilty of.  He's not even mincing words.  He's saying.  Well these are the statements where he just had to read.  And then when they started drilling them. 
[00:57:00]  Oh okay.  The papers are saying they got a lot of like experts on body language and stuff.  And they're all in agreement that this guy in their humble opinion is so lying.  Just how he's answering the questions and how his.  I forgot all the stuff but how he was moving his head and his eyes and all that crap.  Like when they said did you do steroids when he hid under the desk and said no.  You want more of this or what?  Oh yeah.  Okay.  But I've got to try and set the record straight. 
[00:57:30]  However by doing so I'm putting myself out there to all of you.  Knowing that because I said that I didn't take steroids that this is look.  You're a liar.  Mr. Mitchell's report.  Where am I to go with that?  Savage animal.  I'm not saying Mr. Mitchell's report is entirely wrong.  I am saying Brian McNamee's statements about me are wrong.  Oh.  Let me be clear.  I have never taken steroids or HGH.  That answer is.  False.  Oh.  Damn. 
[00:58:00]  By the way we're just joking.  This is our fine take on it.  Of course it is.  I'm not buying it and I also don't care.  He could be lying to Congress.  What is the joke?  That's perjury.  That's what they call that little perjury.  You can't just lie to Congress.  You can't.  It's like when Clinton lied into her oath.  Like when he got the thing from Lewinsky. 
[00:58:30]  It's like everyone's like oh it's only oral sex.  But it's like it was the poison that lied into her oath.  That's where it's a problem.  You can't do it.  That is what Martha Stewart went to jail for.  She didn't go to jail for insider trading or anything like that.  She went to jail for perjuring herself.  And yeah you go watch that.  You can't just make up stuff in front of those guys.  When there are senators sitting there asking you a question.  When they have like an R or a D and then a state next to their name. 
[00:59:00]  You have to kind of give it up and admit your embarrassment.  I guess he's probably thinking they don't really have enough proof.  They can't get it because it's all other people's words.  Except for the needles and stuff.  And that isn't this evidence.  You know how the police have to secure evidence at an arrest.  When they arrest somebody and at the trial.  They have to prove that the evidence was secured at the crime scene.  And could take it through every step of what happened to it. 
[00:59:30]  From the time it was taken at the crime scene.  To the time it's in court.  You can't just take a bag full of syringes.  That some guy had in his closet somewhere.  And then use it against him as some kind of evidence.  So he probably knows that.  His lawyer told him that.  And nothing's going to come of this.  Like he sounds convincing.  That's all he's got to do is sound convincing.  So you're saying you don't think that the evidence was stored properly. 
[01:00:00]  When they were in a shop right bag in the closet.  Exactly.  Next to some old sneakers.  Something signed by David Cohn in 1995.  This guy's a creep.  What a ghoul this trainer is.  Yeah.  Well this is the trainer talking right now.  Here's Louis Tion's jock strap.  I eat clam chowder out of it.  My name is Brian Gerard McNamee.  Yeah.  And I was once the personal trainer for one of the greatest pitches in the history of baseball. 
[01:00:30]  Yes!  Roger William Clemens.  During the time that I worked with Roger Clemens.  I injected him on numerous occasions with steroids and human growth.  Stop it!  I also injected...  Quiet.  ...and Chuck Knobloch with HGH.  Quiet.  You are one pathetic loser.  What a rat.  He's a...  A rat.  A whole family of rats.  Did they ask him, did you do this, and he's just saying he's not going to jail for these  guys?  I don't know.  Is there a jail sentence?  That's just it. 
[01:01:00]  It's...  There's no jail...  He wants...  For lying, I mean.  For...  Well, for lying, perhaps, but there's...  Do any listeners know, did he admit...  Did he just come out and blast them, or did they say to him, did you do this, and now  he's just going, yeah, I'll tell you what you want to know?  Well, we got our expert, Travis.  Is it our correspondent, our sports correspondent?  Yes, Travis.  McNamee originally talked to the Mitchell Report to avoid jail time.  Why would he have gotten jail time?  For selling and distributing steroids. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  They had evidence that he had done this?  Him and the Mets trainer, I forget his name, but they both...  Those were pretty much the only two trainers that talked to the Mitchell Report.  Really?  And it was both to avoid, like, these massive jail sentences that they were going to get.  Okay.  All right.  More from Brian McNamee.  I told the investigators that I injected three people, two of whom I know confirmed my account.  The third is sitting at this table.  When I first provided information to federal investigators, I had not spent much time going back over these facts 
[01:02:00]  and trying to piece together the details.  And I guess maybe I wanted to downplay the extent of their use because I felt I was betraying the players I had trained.  In the following weeks and months, I've had the opportunity to think about these events and consider the specific drug regimens we used.  As a result, I now believe that the numbers of times I injected Roger Clemens and Chuck Knobloch was actually greater than I initially stated.  Goodness gracious! 
[01:02:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  No.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Roger's bent over with his pants down, getting a needle in his hiney.  Andy Pettit's smiling because he knows what it's like.  Chuck Knobloch is fighting his OCD, tipping his cap and tapping his dirt.  We get it, Chuck.  Oh, wow.  What a scene!  Oh, no. 
[01:03:00]  But it really is silly.  This is Congress.  Congress knew!  Yeah.  I'll be seeing you all again in court.  I recently provided physical evidence to federal investigators that I believe will confirm my account,  including syringes that I used in 2001 to inject Roger Clemens with performance-enhancing drugs.  This evidence is 100% authentic.  And the DNA and chemical analysis should bear this out.  And can be bought for a limited time only right now on FlexPay. 
[01:03:30]  Right now.  Roger Clemens ass syringes.  Roger Clemens ass syringes, people.  In pristine condition.  And you're going to get a Sosa and Maguire rookie card because no one cares about him anymore.  And a Louis T. on jockstrap.  How about we get you a Maguire rookie card now?  One of him crying and emaciated.  Yeah, he wasn't on the HT whatever it is. 
[01:04:00]  Human growth hormone.  Human growth hormone and Clemens ass cheek blood.  Be dialing, people.  Be dialing.  Put it on FlexPay.  Look, I'm going to open up this syringe.  There it is.  There it looks.  The blood's still out.  I poked myself.  I hope you don't have the AIDS.  I hope you don't have the AIDS. 
[01:04:30]  Bug.  You're getting syringes.  These are genuine syringes.  Genuine syringes.  We got Barry Bond's snotty tissues.  His snotty tissues.  He blows his nose.  Rumor has it pieces of brain matter come out from the steroids.  Be dialing, people.  Be dialing.  We got Andy Pettit. 
[01:05:00]  We got Jose Canseco's used toilet paper.  Been saving it in my closet for a while.  I don't know.  Was that Joe Torre's prostate juice?  Joe Torre's prostate juice.  Be dialing, people.  Be dialing. 
[01:05:30]  Put it on FlexPay.  And open up this package of syringes and gauze.  These gauze were used to cover up the syringe wounds on Roger, the Rocket Clemens' butt cheek.  Look at that.  Then why is it brown?  You're going to get extra with this one, people.  It's a scratch and sniff.  Scratch and sniff.  Be dialing.  Be dialing.  Be dialing. 
[01:06:00]  Jim Laird's liver.  Jim Laird's liver.  You know it's got to have holes in it like Swiss cheeks.  I mean, come on.  He blew a 1.5 or something.  Do we have this?  Is this available?  Roger Clemens, the ass cheek scar tissue from so many injection site injections.  Be dialing.  Be dialing. 
[01:06:30]  Be dialing.  Yeah, the kids are going to love this.  Maybe they can eat their cornflakes in the morning with it.  It's Joe Pepitone's Coke spoon.  Joe Pepitone's Coke spoon.  Get the genuine pudding bowl that Lyle Alzado used.  The genuine pudding bowl he used to put his brain in at night when it dribbled out his ear because of the steroids. 
[01:07:00]  Pedro Martinez dead roosters.  Pedro Martinez dead roosters.  Be dialing.  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, you get Billy Martin's windshield, complete with matted hairs, where he went right through and hit the tree.  No seatbelts for that rebel. 
[01:07:30]  Be dialing.  Of course we're not.  A lot of very tough to get items.  Oh, there it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Brady's tears.  Tom Brady's tears.  Taken right off his cheeks when he knew he lost to the Giants and the perfect season went down the crap. 
[01:08:00]  Complete with a certificate of authenticity.  Be dialing.  Corey Lytle's pilot's permit.  Slightly damaged.  Consenco's tic-tac testicle. 
[01:08:30]  Be dialing, people.  Put it on FlexPay.  You're not going to regret this.  It's only going to go up in price.  Do you get it?  He's saving some weird crap.  Why is he saving all of these things?  The rest of his statement.  Bear this out.  To put in context, the issue of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs in baseball was starting to pick up steam in 2000. 
[01:09:00]  While I liked and admired Roger Clemens, I don't think that I ever really trusted him.  Maybe my years as a New York City police officer had made me wary.  But I just had the sense that if this ever blew up and things got messy, Roger would be looking out for number one.  I viewed the syringes as evidence that would prevent me from being the only fall guy.  What a dick.  What a dick.  You guys got along.  You had a really nice relationship.  Until all hell broke loose.  Be dialing right now, Susan Waldman's ****. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, wow.  Susan Waldman's ****.  Be dialing, people.  There's only two.  Wow.  She's beloved.  Is she?  Fraggle rock face bugs me.  Let's say hi to Chris in Toronto.  Chris.  Don, Don, I need that Rick Zednick's jugular.  Rick Zednick's jugular vein. 
[01:10:00]  Be dialing, people.  Michael Vick's dog, that's hack.  Come on, Jeff.  Of course it is.  Put it on FlexPaint.  All right.  Well, we're going to get more from Don.  We got more audio from Clemens talking yesterday down there in Congress.  Kobe's bloody rape rag.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  Some of the people on PalTalk are chiming in.  Yeah.  With the...  All right.  Black History Month.  Yeah.  We got today's honoree as we go.  Sean Taylor's house key.  Ladies and gentlemen, be dialing.  Just walk right in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Plenty of little toys from the Benoit house. 
[01:11:00]  Too much?  Yeah, a little bit.  I'm tapping out.  This was UFC.  This is me.  All right.  In honor of Black History Month, here is today's honoree.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[01:11:30]  Today, we honor Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry for their poignant roles in the racially charged 1991 Spike Lee joint, Jungle Fever.  Yo, Ben, would you let two loving brothers get a moment alone to get reacquainted, you know what I'm saying?  Where the f*** am I supposed to go? I don't know where the f*** I am.  What the f*** are you going to go?  Where you go? Can't you skin-ass go?  I got a motherf***er swing away from it.  I swing, motherf***er.  Get the man down here. 
[01:12:00]  I'm going to get a motherf***er money.  Put you on the f***er, motherf***er.  Where the f***er, motherf***er, smoke this f***er.  Give me a motherf***er.  Take this motherf***er.  Take this motherf***er.  Never has such raw f***ing emotion been captured in one f***ing scene.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up? 
[01:12:30]  We're like.  Happy Valentine's Day.  I just heard a lot of yucks as I said that.  You know, there was something yesterday.  What was the number?  Can't remember the number now. 
[01:13:00]  It might have been as high as 8 million.  You know that 8 million?  Let's just go with 8 million.  Ah, right.  It might be 3 million.  3 or 8.  That's pretty close, right?  Pretty, uh...  It gets the point across of what I'm about to say.  You know that either 3 million or 8 million people  buy themselves a gift on Valentine's Day?  I think it was 8.  Oh, you saw it too?  Yeah.  That seems a bit high.  8 million people care that much about Valentine's Day  that they're buying themselves gifts  so they don't look as pathetic as they actually are? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  That's sad, man.  That is sad.  I read that yesterday and that's exactly the feeling I got.  A lot of sadness.  Is that that sad?  Like somebody doing that?  Or is it just somebody going out and buying themselves something?  Oh, maybe.  Like, did they count that?  Like, if you make a purchase for yourself today,  is that considered just buying yourself something?  Or do they get a little romantic thing  and then make believe that somebody gave it to them?  Ooh, that's sad. 
[01:14:00]  I think it's a bit of both.  Mostly making believe they got someone that really loves them.  All right.  I'll bring it up.  I'll bring up the school thing.  Because growing up and going to school,  there was no more degrading day for some people  than Valentine's Day.  And I think they did away with a lot of this in school these days.  Right.  Because Valentine's Day, you'd come in  and girls and guys are trading Valentine's.  And there would be people with stacks of Valentine's, 
[01:14:30]  just bagfuls, going from class to class,  and then other people that did not get a one.  What?  I just raised my hand.  Which one were you?  The guy that didn't get any.  You had to get something, right?  No, man.  Blonde hair, come on.  I developed way too late.  Yeah, but didn't they consider you like,  oh, he's adorable or something?  I looked like I was 12 when I was in high school.  No, I didn't get any.  No?  And the girl that developed a little early,  man, she was going home with a mailbag full. 
[01:15:00]  Who were you?  I got a lot, but it was because I was kind of the funny guy.  I make the girls laugh and stuff.  But it wasn't like I was really, you know,  it wasn't like a Valentine thing, like, I'm going to get something.  And it was back in the elementary school days.  Did your school have the master computer program?  What the hell was that?  I don't know.  You had to answer a few questions. 
[01:15:30]  And then it was, they gave you a readout of who your mate from your class would be.  Jesus, no.  And it would be, I don't know.  The teacher.  I think it would be like three choices they give you,  who you match up with in your grade, according to these questions answered.  And everyone would be creeped out.  Because you'd be excited, like, wow, I'm way out of my league.  Yeah.  And the girls are thinking, yuck.  Never worked out for me with a girl that I wanted to get a Valentine from.  And I'd have one for her, but always just too scared, chicken crap to give it to her. 
[01:16:00]  I was the worst.  Just, my life is full of these young regrets of just not doing what I should have done.  And, you know, it doesn't, it's not as bad now, but while you're growing up past that,  you're just like, what an idiot.  Why didn't you just give it a shot?  There was one girl, and she gave me a Valentine and wanted me to be her boyfriend. 
[01:16:30]  And another girl liked me, but I didn't know she liked me.  And she had talked me out of accepting the Valentine from the other girl in the class  and said, don't go out with her.  And I'm like, okay.  So in the middle of one of the classes, I opened the door and I said, I'm not going out with you.  And I flicked the Valentine back at her.  And the girl that told me to do it never went out with me or anything.  She just, I don't know what her plan was. 
[01:17:00]  That's right.  A little vindictive bitch.  Oh, I know.  And I was just a pee-whipped idiot.  You know how we talk about how much we hate, like, what they're doing in schools these days?  Yeah.  Another example today.  I need to know who's coming up with this crap.  I'll explain in a second.  We've got to go to Jim in Maine.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, my son sent home from school.  All the kids in his class, and he had to make a Valentine's Day for all the boys and all the girls. 
[01:17:30]  All the boys?  The hell is that about?  You'd never give another boy a Valentine card?  Well, you want to make sure everyone feels special, and we're all equals, and blah.  And the Chinese are coming, and that's why they're going to take over the world.  They're not making their little Chinese children right out of Valentine for every single schoolmate.  They're making them eat lead paint and work all hours.  Oh, my God.  Enough with this crap. 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  I'm part of growing up to go through a little disappointment and go home without any Valentine's Day.  It makes you a stronger person.  You're right as you get older.  But when you're a kid, and I'm almost saying it's humiliating, man.  And I'm not talking about they should absolutely take test scores.  I don't believe in that liberal crap.  But when you're a little kid, you're not getting a Valentine.  That's humiliating.  Do you think that the humiliation that you have to go through growing up with certain things like that,  being the one that doesn't get the Valentine cards and made fun of, 
[01:18:30]  do you think that builds your character, though, as you get older?  And is it negative or positive?  Does it let you handle situations better?  Or does it just ruin you in certain aspects of your life when you get older?  I don't know.  I'm just saying, like, if you put these safeguards in place when they're younger and in school like that,  is it ruining what they're going to become when they get older and making them weaker people? 
[01:19:00]  I think wanting a little kid to feel good is one thing.  Like, there's a difference between that when they start overprotecting high school students and even, like, you know, a 13-year-old.  Then they're just babying these little sissies.  But it's like when you're, like, really, really young.  Like you're saying, like, you're eight years old, you're in school.  It feels special.  But then maybe that's the teacher's responsibility to figure something out.  It scares me that you're taking the individuality out of the school system.  That's what it is, individuality. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're kind of trying to make everything the same.  Basically, if we continue down this path, we'll all just be robots.  No emotions.  We won't hate anybody.  We'll all think the same, act the same.  That's never going to happen.  Don't forget school shootings and all this stuff, though.  Very rarely do you have these things by kids that were treated well and loved.  Yeah, it's usually the weird little outcasts.  Bullied people.  But, Jimmy, look at it the other way.  You go to school as an 8-, 9-, 10-year-old, and you come home with a valentine from every single person in your class.  What does that mean, then? 
[01:20:00]  It doesn't mean anything.  Maybe I'm older and I can see.  They're obligated.  Yeah, maybe I'm older and I can see through this crap.  But I would be like, this isn't special.  This is, like, this is all just was forced upon us.  You're right.  But when you're 8 or 9, you don't see the obligatory side of it.  I think that's where the teacher gets involved and tries to make that kid that might not be getting the valentine special in some other way.  And then, how about the fact that do they have to write the same – it's going to get to the point where they have to write the same thing on all the valentines because they're going to give cards to everybody.  But some people are going to get cards with special stuff written on it.  Like if a girl likes a boy, she'll write something nice in there. 
[01:20:30]  And then just sign her name on some scrub she doesn't like, valentine.  And then they're going to say, well, no, now you can't even write in them.  You've just got to sign it.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I understand Jim's point about, you know, you don't want to hurt little kids like that at that age.  It's kind of devastating.  But unfortunately, that is part of life.  And I don't know if it's a positive or a negative once you get older.  I think the sooner you learn that, the better you're going to be.  They'll have plenty of time to learn it.  Believe me. 
[01:21:00]  They'll learn it fast.  The ones who aren't good at sports will never be good at sports.  The ones who aren't smart technically will never be smart.  Yeah, but do you want to hit that brick wall of rejection and stuff when you reach a certain age?  Or do you need to be weaned into it?  You know, it's like you're protected up to a certain point.  You're going to have to face life.  And it sucks.  Life sucks, especially at that age.  So would you rather slowly get into it and even at an early age kind of deal with disappointment?  Or just hit it headlong when you're in junior high or high school. 
[01:21:30]  You deal with disappointment.  You understand disappointment.  You work your way around disappointment.  I mean, Jimmy brings up the, you know, you're never going to be good in sports, let's say, in general.  So what are the schools doing?  There's no winners.  There's no losers.  I hate that crap.  That's not preparing a kid for anything out there.  It's crap.  And I don't have kids, but I see it through my nephews and nieces.  And they get frustrated.  Like, screw this.  I want to freaking win.  Yeah.  We're a better team. 
[01:22:00]  People are competitive.  We're a better team, and we want to beat the crap out of it.  It's ingrained in us.  Just teach them how to lose gracefully.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not saying when you're eight, it's Valentine.  There's something about when you're that young.  The boy that likes the girl, the girl that likes the boy, they're going to meet up.  You're going to get rejected most of the year anyway.  So if it's a stupid card that everybody else is getting, it's like harmless.  It just doesn't.  To me, toughen up, kid.  You didn't get a card.  It's like that's not teaching you anything.  It's like, you know, whatever.  Maybe it's not the kid that got the card.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:22:30]  But then I think the teachers could actually go, look, this doesn't really mean anything  in the long run.  Maybe that would be their job.  We all got rejected in school.  I didn't get you know what until I was a bit older because I was a scrawny little nothing.  You didn't get what?  Hoo-ha!  I lost my virginity late.  All that crap because I was almost 19.  So was I.  I was 18.  I was almost 19.  I was actually a freshman in college when it finally happened because I was like so much.  I looked like a, I looked so much younger than, than my age. 
[01:23:00]  Still do to this day.  I remember, see, I remember some of this stuff pretty vividly.  So, but I don't know if that's detrimental or if it's just, you know, made me, uh, uh, who  I am for good or bad, but I do.  I remember this stuff, uh, vividly, you know, and, and remember feeling certain ways and,  and it's odd.  It kind of built, it builds you into who you are.  So I don't know if it's good or bad.  And the anticipation of thinking, wow, I might get one from that girl. 
[01:23:30]  I kind of been eyeing.  And the disappointment when you don't.  Well, but it's part of the whole thing.  But if you're, if you're going through school and you're just getting a Valentine from everybody,  what is that?  That's, that's like, you want to talk about disappointment.  That exactly meaningless.  Yeah.  It means nothing.  I think that's worse.  I really do.  I remember my humiliations.  Well, yeah, you remember the man.  It's like, you happen to be funny.  Like that's what you're like.  You're lack of low self.  You have low self esteem, but that's what made that worked out for you being great comedically, 
[01:24:00]  but that doesn't work out for most people like that.  You know what I mean?  Like low self esteem translates.  You're just going to feel like crap.  Walk into a psychiatrist's office and hack them apart with a meat cleaver.  That's what Grizzly was going to say.  I want to give him credit.  Oh, sorry.  No, you didn't see that.  But he says, you're thinking like Grizzly, he says, not getting Valentine's cards turns  you into meat cleaver killer.  Meat cleaver killer.  Very funny.  And by the way, I said parents and someone's bringing up, Opie, what about, what about,  I mean, I brought up teachers and people are saying, what about parents?  Yeah, I think it's also the parents' responsibility. 
[01:24:30]  My parents sat me down and, you know, would give me pep talks and stuff because I was  really bummed out that I wasn't growing and maturing at the same rate as everybody else.  You know?  They give you little pep talks.  It's their job as a parent.  You'd hide up in the atmosphere.  To figure out what the hell's going on and work through some of this stuff that's going  on.  You know?  I didn't get to like ask.  I finally got to go to my senior prom, but I had to go with a 15-year-old.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:25:00]  You say that again, it jumped.  I went with a 15-year-old exchange student.  Like, she just moved into the...  Oh, that's great.  What the hell are you bitching about?  I know.  Jesus.  No, no, no.  But it's easy.  It was the little African girl that was like Escarol.  Here's an American custom we have.  Hello.  No, no, no, no, no.  See, that or no limo ride.  I didn't mean...  You know, I gave you guys a bit, but I didn't mean exchange students.  She came from another school late in the year, so she didn't know anyone.  So she was like, oh, my God. 
[01:25:30]  Did she have a Pete Rose hair?  No.  Did her metal get in the way when you were dancing?  Oh, my God.  Your huge tongue is beautiful.  I love you.  All right.  Don't talk.  No, she was actually beautiful, but, yeah, she didn't know anyone.  I would have never got that if she was in my school for another week or two.  She would have met more people.  Yeah, just give her another week and you're out.  Right.  I told you the story, too, because then she was my girlfriend for the entire summer, 
[01:26:00]  and then I go away to Geneseo.  I haven't told her story in a while.  I got to tell her real fast.  So I remember as I'm going out with her, actually, it was like spring through the summer.  All of a sudden, she went back to her hometown or the town she just moved from,  and she had to be up there for a few days.  I thought that was a little weird and stuff, and I just put it in the back of my head like,  yeah, whatever.  And then I go to Geneseo, and I meet this kid on my floor.  I forgot his name, and we're talking about the prom and stuff because now we're freshmen, 
[01:26:30]  and I'm talking about this girl I took that was beautiful, and she's kind of my girlfriend  back home, but it's long distance.  I don't know if it's going to work out.  And all of a sudden, he's like, wow, this is way too familiar, right?  And he goes, well, I went to the prom with a girl named the same name.  Oh.  Really?  And I'm like, well, what does she look like?  And, yeah, you get where I'm going.  We went to the prom with the same effing girl, the one I thought was my girlfriend for that 
[01:27:00]  whole time from spring through the end of summer.  Or she went back to where she moved from to go to the prom with this guy.  She went to two proms.  Prom whore.  Within a month.  And he drags out the picture.  She wore the same dress and everything.  Has a stain that you left on it?  He comes back to my dorm room or whatever, and we pull out the pictures, and we're like,  holy crap, how funny is this?  And what are the odds, too?  He lived on my floor in college.  So what happened?  Did you ever bang her again and pretend you didn't know? 
[01:27:30]  I never banged her.  You didn't?  No, no.  I said I lost my virginity when I went to college.  Well, you said you said you said you were virginity.  We had make-out sessions, and I tried to get patch.  But the girls, you know, she had a lot of kind of kung fu moves to keep me away from  it, man.  Wow.  Kung fu moves?  Oh, wow.  Was she really...  Oh, wow.  She knew all the moves in the book.  She knew how to break submission holes.  Oh, my gosh.  She would do great in the UFC. 
[01:28:00]  She knew how to get out of some holes.  Just as you unzip the zipper, she taps it out.  Right.  Come on.  You're tapping out?  You can't do that.  Well, Doug disagrees, and that's fine.  I mean, the one thing about our show for the newbies, a lot of radio shows, they throw  crap down your throat, and they want you just to think like they do.  We're not about that.  Yeah, we just throw this stuff out there, and then we get the other side, hopefully.  Doug, what do you got?  I'm going to make fun of you. 
[01:28:30]  Hi.  I'm a big fan of your guys, not a new listener.  Welcome aboard, Doug.  I'm not a new listener.  I'm a big fan.  Oh, okay.  I'm just calling to say I disagree with you guys that it's bad to give the kids a Valentine.  And it goes back to, you know, how Opie is saying that, you know, Chinese, that's why  they're going to beat us.  In the Chinese schools, the kids don't get to talk, which is what I want.  They don't talk to each other. 
[01:29:00]  They don't pick on each other.  They sit, and they work, and they learn.  That's why our kids stink.  All they do is pick on each other and bully each other, and that's why we have to do  this, because our kids are mongrel.  Well, I think there's a line, sir, you draw.  Don't talk to each other and learn.  You lose a certain human...  All right, go ahead.  Sorry, I didn't mean to make a point.  You go right ahead.  I was trying to discuss something with you, but I should just be a spectator in your play.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I think there's a line you got to draw between, you know, between, you know, kids being a 
[01:29:30]  bunch of, you know, blithering bullies and, you know, communist China.  There's got to be a little balance in there.  What do you think?  I've got to say, honestly, I don't think there's a line.  I think the kids in this country, all they do is beat on each other until they lose it.  I was in that generation right before they started the school shootings, right beforehand.  I graduated high school the year they did...  Oh, sorry you missed it.  Were you bullied?  Yeah, I know.  They went nuts.  Kids could do anything they wanted.  Were you bullied?  No, I was bigger than people.  Oh, you were.  Okay.  I had some problems because I was in special ed, but I never had to deal with, like, 
[01:30:00]  the, quote, bullying.  You know, no one would start a fight with me.  I was much larger than the other kids.  So, okay.  Of course you were.  You were older.  Were they now...  How would they tease you for being in special ed?  Oh, you know, I took the little short bus.  I mean, come on.  Why?  Once you're in that, you go.  I have attention deficit and dyslexia.  I have difficulty reading.  I want...  By the way, the advertisers are loving this guy because this is our audience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is our target demo.  I'm very smart.  I work...  Yeah, good luck selling this dummy a car. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, fool.  Oh, fool.  I didn't take the rule that you had to take that stupid bus, and I had to deal with it.  So what would...  That's funny.  It's kind of not fair that, you know, you have some ADD or something, you're on the short  bus.  Because as soon as you see that short bus go by, you're not thinking that...  You're thinking they're all the same.  What would they say to you?  What kind of teasing would you get?  Oh, the thing...  I'll tell you.  You're going to laugh, but the thing...  No, I won't.  Yes, you will.  The thing they called the kids on these buses, they called them window lickers. 
[01:31:00]  Window lickers?  Wow.  I've never heard that, but you have ADD, so you probably shouldn't have remembered that.  They put the ADD kids on the same bus as the full-blown retarded kids who would  just bang their heads.  Look at the kid with the ADD.  He focuses when he's being talked about.  How about you focus when the teacher's at the front of the class?  Would somebody film this bus ride?  How do you not make a reality show out of that?  All right, listen.  Listen, Doug, what can I tell you?  We'll agree with you. 
[01:31:30]  What?  I'll go.  You're a little radical, Doug, with the communist China idea.  Yeah, you're thinking, you know, a little too far both ways.  You will not laugh.  You will not cry.  You will not talk to...  All right, get a hold of yourself.  So let's go to Tiffany in Queens.  Tiffany?  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I'm calling.  I'm a fifth-grade teacher in Queens.  And, you know, he's right.  Kids can be cruel to each other.  So my rule in my classroom is you can't bring in anything.  If parents do send in something, it's for the whole class. 
[01:32:00]  But I just go and I buy stuff for the whole class.  I just left Pathmark with $30 worth of stuff.  Wow.  Well, I mean, either that or the kids who smell funny don't get anything.  You know what I mean?  The stinky kids don't get anything.  Well, maybe then they'll shower, for God's sake.  They're making their own candy.  Don't worry about them.  The thing about it is in fifth grade, you know, when you're starting to change, you know?  You used to smell fresh all the time, and now you don't realize you don't smell fresh all the time.  Yeah.  You know, so it's like rather than have those kids tortured, even when they're sweet kids, 
[01:32:30]  I just get stuff for everyone and say we can have a little party, quote-unquote,  because they're not allowed to have them.  I bet you go to the store and get $30 worth of soap and deodorant for the children.  Exactly.  Here's some polo, you little dirtbag.  Believe me.  My kids each have a little baggie with mini deodorants and toothbrushes and toothpaste and wipes for after gym.  Oh, ain't you nice?  Getting something from a teacher was really cool when you were younger, too.  Yeah.  Because I sit here. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  What?  What?  I was going to go at a sex angle, but that's great, Jimmy.  I was secretly looking for a mommy figure, so if a teacher, like, did something nice for me,  it made me very happy.  Aw.  An older woman paying attention to me!  Especially in this grade when you're a hot teacher, let me tell you.  Are you hot?  Ooh.  Are you a hot teacher?  Oh, did I say that?  I'm cute.  You bring it.  All right, what's your Facebook? 
[01:33:30]  MySpace?  Your Facebook.  Do you have a Facebook account?  I have a MySpace account.  That's so last month.  Oh, God, you're so 06.  I know.  You're so January.  Can we see your MySpace?  You'll get some friends today.  Sure.  What's your thing?  Okay, don't make fun of me.  It's Tiff Rub.  T-I-F or T-I-F-F?  T-I-F-F. 
[01:34:00]  T-I-F-F.  Oh, I thought you said something else.  No, no, Tiff.  Oh, hey, what?  Wow, you're, like, tied up.  Is that you with the scarf?  Oh, she's cute.  Scarf?  No.  It's just an ant, I think.  Yeah, you're the right color black, by the way.  What's up?  I know that's not PC, but you're the right color black.  Let's be honest with you.  A little mocha.  Yeah, she's got a little lighter than Halle Berry.  Oh, yeah.  Big eyes.  Big mouth. 
[01:34:30]  Wow.  And you wonder where the hands are.  Wow.  Wow.  I've never seen so many teeth in my life.  You give a very big, pretty smile.  No, she's definitely cute, man.  Is there more pictures?  Thank you.  Yeah, how about getting it bigger than a postage stamp there, E-Rock, huh?  Yeah, we want to see.  How about sharing with the rest of the show?  We want to make sure you're not doing any of that MySpace voodoo we talk about.  Are these legit pics, or are you hiding behind a tree with sunglasses on, linger along?  No, no, no. 
[01:35:00]  All my pictures are.  Some are great, some aren't so great.  What can you say, you know?  Not everyone photographs well all the time.  I hear you, man.  We're trying to see them, Tiffany, but it's kind of hard.  There we go, because E-Rock's opening them up now.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, right on, man.  Oh, okay.  So do you know, let me ask you a question.  Like, when you see, like, the one kid not getting any, like, candy, does it just make  the little bastards sad?  You know, it does.  And the funny thing is, the one kid that usually doesn't get stuff, I have a half special ed  population. 
[01:35:30]  So some of the ones who don't know they're getting them are just, like, whatever.  But the ones who know, you know, they get a little bit sad, and they call me on the weekend.  How you doing, Ms. Rubin?  What are you doing this weekend, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, I always try to, like, be extra nice to them.  I sit next to them in class.  Okay.  I got your MySpace voodoo, by the way.  All right.  You're definitely cute.  Nice face.  Nice cleavage.  I've seen it all here.  You're hiding the ass. 
[01:36:00]  You're hiding the ass.  What's up?  Well, it's, I didn't realize I was hiding it.  It's a black girl's ass, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, you know, one of those shelf booties, not too wide, not too fat, but a nice little  shelf going on there.  All the guys are looking at it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like a shelf money.  So are the kids trying to have sex with you?  No, I get a few, you know.  Oh, you know, you look hot today, or one kid, I was doing, oh my God, you know how 
[01:36:30]  if you do, you have to, we have an HIV AIDS curriculum, and in fifth grade, you start talking  about sex.  And, you know, one student, this was last year, I was giving the lecture to the class,  and he was like, you know, you look really hot today.  I was like, okay, and that ends this.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a ballsy move, like, that just didn't happen.  Yeah.  There weren't, like...  He was in the fourth grade at the time, so now every time he sees me, he's like, hey, 
[01:37:00]  every time I walk into the classroom, how you doing?  I was like, oh, hey.  Wow.  Yeah, but people are suggesting that we Google bomb Tiff Rub today.  Help you out with a little Google bomb.  Oh.  We like to Google bomb from time to time.  Make the top search.  You look like one of the dancers from Orlando's.  Ah, yes.  That's for The Wire.  That's the strip club that Barksdale owns.  I'm finally watching The Wire, so I'm going to just throw, like, Wire references in for  good.  Okay.  From now on. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Hey, thank you so much for your call, Tiffany.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Happy Valentine's Day, madam.  Happy Valentine's Day.  I'm turning into, by the way, if any listeners that might...  I'm turning into a repugnant sissy in my late 30s.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of are.  I should have my teeth just hammered out.  You think I don't notice?  I think it's good for all the kids to have a card.  Yeah, you really need to move to Berkeley.  You're, um...  You're...  I think you're a lot more in touch with your feelings these days.  I think you're kind of getting that whole thing dealt with in your mind. 
[01:38:00]  It's good.  Now I'm going to break the sexual addiction.  I go home at noon, and I don't remove my hand from myself until 8.40 when I have to  if you go to a show.  That's healthy.  Yeah.  Is it a constant thing with you?  Or is it like the search for the perfect bit of smut that makes it that much better  when you're done?  Is it...  Or is it just this one after another? 
[01:38:30]  Just the distraction.  Or one big build?  Is yours multiple?  Or one long build that finishes and then you realize, why did I waste so much time doing  that when I could have been done in a minute?  It normally ends right before bed, so I don't have to face the reality.  See, it's great escape.  It's noise.  It's white noise.  Yeah.  It's the air conditioner.  It's the fan.  It's zzzz.  You're like a little monkey sitting on a log in a zoo.  Absolutely.  How they just kind of...  I don't want to be here.  I want...  So I'm just going to... 
[01:39:00]  That's exactly it.  A little monkey.  Yeah.  And I paid dominatius just to throw it at me.  We got to take a break.  In honor of Tiffany that we just talked to, we're going to go to break with a Black History  Month Valentine's Day song.  Ooh.  Very clever, E-Rock.  E-Rock wrote that.  It's a Stephen Lynch song.  You'll know it.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a song about the truth. 
[01:39:30]  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember the lyrics sometime.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart sometimes, the truth will ever sting.  Just don't take it personally, this is no attack.  But we will never last because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait. 
[01:40:00]  The caramel girls and mocha girls, just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy.  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, you're just not the girl for me.  Woo-hoo.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac. 
[01:40:30]  Don't call it jungle fever, cause that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls, just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker, else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream. 
[01:41:00]  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls, just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key. 
[01:41:30]  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of you.  Thomas Jefferson.  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong, thermal.  Strong, thermal.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, awesome.  Very nice.  Yes.  We were just laughing our asses off during the break.  Coke Logic really did a great job with the latest animation.  This one is a little confusing.  He's doing some for onaradio.com, and then he does others that are different for iTunes.  Yep.  This kid's busy.  It's the one with E-Rock's fridge, and it's really, really funny. 
[01:42:30]  You go to iTunes under, where is it under iTunes?  Podcast, I guess?  It's the O.B. and Anthony Podcast.  O.B. and Anthony Podcast.  It's free.  We don't get any money from this.  It's a free thing, these little videos he does.  And he really is brilliant with this stuff.  He does such a good job of animating and picking the clips from the show, because it's the actual audio from the show.  And he animates it.  And this one, he outdid himself with this one.  It's the time E-Rock's refrigerator door fell off. 
[01:43:00]  And we discussed it here on the show.  And just some funny lines.  And the animation just enhances it so much.  Really good.  When Jimmy goes into a Steve impression, it doesn't just show Jimmy doing the Steve impression.  He actually animated Steve.  So it's Jim's impression of Steve coming out of the animated Steve.  It looks like him.  Really funny, yeah.  It's the first appearance of Steve from Foundry Music.  There's such dark versions of ourselves.  Like, really are kind of creepy. 
[01:43:30]  And what a good job, man.  Yeah, he's got like the angry Jimmy.  He's got the doe-eyed Anthony.  He's got the psycho me.  He's got the very depressed, sad E-Rock.  Yeah, E-Rock looks sad.  He really has figured out our little nuances.  Hey, Sam's back from L.A.  Moving around a little bit.  All right, Sam.  He was at the Playboy Mansion.  Sammy, baby, L.A., huh?  He was there with Big A at the Playboy Mansion.  And we just got word that Big A actually interviewed Hugh Hefner. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, we got to stand on the red carpet.  And so a bunch of NBC stars came by.  And then at the very end, Hugh Hefner walked the whole thing.  So we grabbed him.  Because we were the last people interviewing on the red carpet.  So we grabbed him.  And within 15 seconds of talking to Big A, he just regretted that he had stopped.  Because Big A was just stuttering the whole time.  He had drool coming down the sides of his mouth.  White stuff all in his teeth.  He was all covering his gums.  He's completely nervous.  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:30]  Just that goop.  That nerve goop and bad breath.  It's like he chewed mothballs up.  And mothball and saliva is coming out of his mouth.  It smells like that and looks like it.  And he can't talk.  And Hugh Hefner can't really hear that well.  But Hugh didn't want to lean in close to Big A because he spits and has bad breath.  Oh, Hugh.  Publicist is like reading the questions for Big A.  Oh, really?  And we got this for tomorrow show?  Yeah.  Big A's coming in to talk about his trip to the Playboy Mansion.  I'm so mad. 
[01:45:00]  I have to ask.  I'm going to be gone, unfortunately.  Did he try to talk to girls?  Yeah, because after the red carpet, there was the party, which was an open bar.  And so Big A probably ended up...  I would say I was...  An estimated count would be literally probably eight rum and Cokes.  Nice.  And he was just going around talking to girls and then asking for their picture with him.  And he's just a sweaty mess.  Sorry, Big A.  Were they happy to do it?  They were just... 
[01:45:30]  Okay.  Like some girl...  Like he would pick a girl or we would...  Me and the winners would encourage him to go after one.  And they're like, yeah, she was into you.  And so he'd start following this one hot girl around.  He would walk over near her and then she would start walking away.  But instead of coming back to talk to us, he would just follow her as she was walking.  Like he was stalking her.  Creep.  That's wonderful.  He's a ghoul.  Wait, he had the white to drool?  No, we couldn't bring a camera. 
[01:46:00]  We couldn't bring a camera?  Well, they said we couldn't and then everybody else brought one.  They didn't want him with a camera.  They don't want to ruin the image of the place with Big A in there.  Yeah, he had two strands of drool coming down from either side of his mouth.  So he looked like a ventriloquist dummy.  And within like an hour of the party, he had untucked his shirt.  And so it came down like halfway to his knees.  So his gut was sticking out and he looked like he was wearing a dress with pants on.  Oh, my God.  Jesus. 
[01:46:30]  Classic.  They gave tours of the mansion, like just the outside of it because you can't go inside.  And he was the only one who's standing behind me panting.  Why couldn't you go in?  Because like they actually lived there.  So like Hugh and his girlfriend.  But there are parties in there.  Yeah, but this was like a corporate party.  So like Hugh Hefner and the girls didn't actually go to the party.  They just went on the red carpet and then stayed in the house.  And then where was the party?  Like it was right outside.  Outside in a tent or something?  Yeah, like they put a big.  Did you see the pool? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't a big enough party for them to actually hang with you guys?  Well, no, it was a big party.  They were there a little bit.  So they're just in the house going there.  There's a party going on outside.  They got parties 24 hours a day.  So they got to pick and choose which ones they're going to actually hang at.  I'm thinking.  There's Big A just following a really hot playboy centerfold around.  And then you got elephant hunters following Big A.  One of the American gladiators was trying to hit on an Asian chick.  So we convinced Big A to be his wingman because the Asian chick was there with her sister. 
[01:47:30]  And so we had Big A following her sister around to get her away so the American gladiator could.  This is why I love Sam.  He's just an ass.  Who knows?  You are an ass.  Be his wingman.  That's great.  God bless Sam.  He might have had trouble with some of the words and the questions that he was asking  because I forgot the ST thing.  Some of the questions had ST words.  Was there any ST stutters?  A couple, maybe.  That's great. 
[01:48:00]  Just a few.  Perhaps a bevy.  Yeah.  A bevy.  Oh, is that great.  I'm so mad I'm going to be gone.  Well, you got to pick up San Francisco, Jimmy.  Yeah, Cobbs tomorrow through Sunday.  Big whoop.  I'd rather be here.  No, you want people to go to your shows.  Oh, yes.  New hour material.  You really want to go there.  New hour material.  Not the HBO stuff.  Big deal.  Thanks, Sam.  We'll have more tomorrow.  We'll have the interviews.  Is there a lot of Big A audio?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  And Big A himself will be making a rare appearance on this show.  Quick question. 
[01:48:30]  Now that he's part of the Ron and Fez program.  How was the flight out?  Did he have to actually, who did he sit next to?  I don't know.  I was not on his flight.  No?  No.  I flew on a separate flight apart from Big A.  Thank God.  Why?  I don't know.  Because you probably would have sat together.  They asked me what time I wanted to fly out.  And I scheduled it so I could get as many days in at work as possible.  Oh, yeah.  That's what you are, yeah.  It conflicted with Big A's schedule.  But he was able, somehow he knew, 15 minutes after I checked in to the hotel, my phone rang 
[01:49:00]  in the room.  And it was Big A asking if I wanted to go get dinner.  But I mean, I was so tired after the flight.  Yeah, I bet.  You were just busy.  I was exhausted.  Oh, you didn't go to dinner with him?  So what did he do?  Just went alone somewhere?  Well, he actually, I don't know what he did that night, but I know.  Can I have a st...  A st...  A st...  A st...  A st...  Ake?  He spent the whole day prior to the Playboy party with the winner and their guest on like  Santa Monica Boulevard or something. 
[01:49:30]  So he was probably like a celebrity to them.  Yeah.  Okay.  Frannies and hookers.  That's what you do at Santa Monica Boulevard.  Hey, a lot of people ask him.  Does Big A drink to...  You do.  Does Big A drink to the point where he doesn't stutter anymore?  No, he was definitely stuttering.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Did he stutter to the girls?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  More tomorrow.  Thank you, Sam.  That's great.  Yeah, absolutely.  Bobby Drew from Brockton.  Figured you guys would enjoy the story of Tyra.  Tyra Banks, of course.  Essing herself.  Can we see if there's anything... 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Coming in on...  That's something.  Yeah, just see if there's anything...  Does she talk about...  That's a Bobby...  That happening to her?  Yeah.  All right.  Before we go back to the Clemens audio, we got a reporter.  This is coming in from Danny.  A reporter wants to know what it's like to be tased.  We love the tase clips.  Can't get enough of them.  Absolutely.  Danny says this is a good one.  This is a good one.  So you got a reporter.  But don't be a reporter.  Most commonly used is the taser gun. 
[01:50:30]  It shoots two small, fishhook-like electrodes, which can shock a person from as far away as 15 feet.  If you're using electrodes that are shot out through the capsule here, then the whole body kind of goes numb.  And I wanted to know exactly how it feels to be on the other end of this effective but not lethal weapon.  It's five seconds of the worst pain that I have ever felt.  Something tells me this guy's felt some other pain, though. 
[01:51:00]  By the sound of that voice.  That's right.  He's been on the receiving end of something else, too.  They want his dental impressions.  They just look for his pillow.  Wow.  He really didn't like that.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, is that good?  Is that better than this, though?  No.  Tase it.  Tase it.  Tase it. 
[01:51:30]  He sounds like the Hamburglar.  Linger longer.  News report is great, because that last thing almost sounds like one of those Mr. Magoo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Magoo.  It's tased underwater.  Let me ask you, when a taser gets shot into you, the fish hooks.  I believe so, yeah.  Does that actually just hook into your skin and lock you in?  Or your clothes, even. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  If you've got a thin shirt on or you're bare-skinned, it'll go right into your skin.  And they're barbs.  It's like a little spear with barbs in it.  And it hooks in there.  And a lot of times when that happens, they just have to take them to the hospital and have them pulled out.  Or some cops will just rip them out.  All right.  But it could go on your clothing, too, and just hang in your clothing and still tase the crap out of you.  If they tase you, like, in the arm, they might have to go to the hospital and get them taken out?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  There have been people where they've had to take them to the hospital to take it out.  No, they just rip them out.  Oh, I'm sure.  As long as the video ain't running, they'll just yank on those.  You think a cop's taking you to the hospital, or is he yanking that out?  Yank that out, man.  He wants his taser back.  Oh, here's a video of the report of the two cops.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll have this up on onaradio.com later today.  He looks like my agent, Pete.  He does.  He looks like I'd like to give Pete a good tasing.  You know what I like?  When they show someone getting tased at the police department, they lower them down slowly onto a mat when they're being tased, 
[01:53:00]  which really makes you appreciate what it's like out on the street when they just tase him and let him fall face first onto the concrete.  You know what I would do?  I would put him on the side of a building ledge.  Oh, hey.  Try to stay on.  Yeah, good luck to you.  That's a good test.  Most commonly used is the taser gun.  It's two small fishhook-like electrodes, which can shock a person from as far away as 15 feet.  If you're using the electrodes that are shot out through the capsule here, then the whole body kind of goes numb. 
[01:53:30]  And I wanted to know exactly how it feels to be on the other end of this effective.  On the other end of what?  On the other end of a vagina?  Oh.  So you don't bite your tongue or anything, right?  I don't know.  I've never been tased.  I don't want to be tased.  I don't know what this taser is.  Are you?  Yeah, because, I mean, again, the cops all have to get tased, I think, right, when they become certified.  Jimmy, would you really do it?  It's possible.  I don't have the nuts to do it, man.  No way.  I wouldn't want to be tased. 
[01:54:00]  I want to know how long you feel bad for.  They seem to recover pretty quickly after the shock stops.  Oh, I thought we had our resident expert come in.  What's wrong, Steve?  Well.  I've been tased in SNL clubs before.  No, I just thought I honestly.  They tased my ass.  Okay, I got it.  No, go ahead.  No.  Why am I here?  No, I don't know.  You just talked to me.  To imitate and make fun of.  Exactly.  I'm very happy that you didn't get brain damaged, by the way.  What are you talking about?  From that incident over the weekend.  It's good to see that you're walking and you're doing fine now. 
[01:54:30]  What are we talking about?  We're happy that you're healthy.  And we're glad you have to go back to Montreal and explain to everybody.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I was once tased on my bare bottom because I was an assless chaps causing a scene.  Thank you, Jimmy, for getting it.  Outside of the ramrod, I was causing a disturbance.  They tased me repeatedly.  The nutcracker suite.  I was in my high heels.  Yes.  I was actually just coming in to stop you from saying,  we should get someone in here to tase Jimmy.  Oh, stop being a party pooper. 
[01:55:00]  Why not?  Because we've tried before and we can't do it.  Why?  It's just, you'd have to go through, it's that whole legal jumbo.  Are they going to chest your heart and stuff?  No one dies from a good tasing.  I don't know about that.  It's the beating you get afterwards.  Yeah, what if I'm a reporter?  Suffocating.  Maybe we can get a word.  Jimmy Norton here on the beat.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve proved today that he's the worst producer Opie and Anthony have ever had.  I like that.  Ceecee, blind Ceecee, blind Ceecee, fake name, fake name, Ceecee, Ceecee, Ceecee. 
[01:55:30]  You know something?  I don't think you have Steve's back.  Yeah.  His big, luscious, hairy Lebanese back.  I don't think, no, the actual thing is, I don't think you have Steve's hips.  I don't think you have your chin and Steve's back.  I don't have his stomach.  Tyrannosaurus does.  I don't have his stomach either.  I was tased in my buttocks.  I was screaming, we're here.  Well, I don't want to say, but it rhymed.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us. 
[01:56:00]  We're here.  We're, well.  It was chilly.  And my buttocks were red from the cold in my assless chaps.  Assless chaps.  And they tased me on my cold red buttocks.  Slipping out of my high heel shoe.  What's wrong with you, Steve?  I had received a good spanking in the ramrod.  The bods got tangled in my hair.  It's very hairy.  Yes, I have a Lebanese hairy hiney.  They had to send me with a weed whacker to the hospital. 
[01:56:30]  I'm the only one that wears assless chaps, and it doesn't look assless.  That's right, PETA attacks me with green paint.  No fur, no fur.  I said it's mine, silly.  They're like, you're wearing the fur of an incompetent monkey.  We can see it.  Oh, man.  Oh, Steve.  Good old Steve.  I don't know why I bother coming in. 
[01:57:00]  You guys know everything already.  Once you run away.  All right.  All right, back for the break.  And that's how you executive predict.  Yes.  Yes, that is.  All right.  Hey, uh.  All right.  Yeah, the second half of the reporter.  I didn't know exactly how it feels to be on the other end of this effective, but not lethal weapon.  He runs out of air.  It's five seconds of the worst pain that I have ever felt. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He runs out of air.  No.  Faison.  Faison.  Faison.  Faison.  Faison.  Faison.  Faison.  Chewbacca.  Sounds like butt warm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's Louie?  The first.  Oh.  Oh, Twitchels?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Louis, I should say.  Oh, God, when he breaks into that Cowardly Lion impression. 
[01:58:00]  It's terrific.  We love when he does it.  It really is good.  It doesn't give me the douche chills at all.  I bet you want to grab his.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  Just looking at that face he makes when he does it.  Oh, it's.  Courage.  Oh, that's horrible.  Courage.  I want to belt him.  I want to grab, because it looks like he's wearing a flesh sweater when he takes his shirt off.  Like, because it blouses out at the bottom.  Because, yeah, he was very fat.  Yeah.  And then he lost a lot of weight.  I like that. 
[01:58:30]  Then suggested that gentleman sounds like he's gargling electricity.  That is really accurate.  Right on.  Oh, yeah.  Or Drack from Enemy Mine being tased.  Hey, I hate to spoil the fun.  We have to take a break.  We got to catch up a little bit, unfortunately.  Damn it.  I know.  I know.  It happens.  Roger Clemens audio.  Maybe.  Being tased?  Maybe some more Roger Clemens audio.  And assless chaps.  And I want to know if maybe a cop could call in. 
[01:59:00]  Is there a way to get tased?  Is that the shortest duration you can actually get a tasing for?  Is there a way to set it low?  Yeah.  For like two seconds?  Yeah.  I think it's the trigger.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I assume that's as long as they're holding the trigger down.  So they could go as short or as long as you want.  But there might be a limit on it.  You know, you can't just hold it down.  We got...  Bah!  Until the battery goes dead.  We got John from the NYPD.  Cops do not get tased during training.  But some cops do.  Because our pal got tased because he had a... 
[01:59:30]  There was a reason why he had to get tased.  I think it's a demonstration.  Like they can pick a cop.  You volunteer or something, right?  You volunteer.  You get like a day off.  And you could be...  You're tased in front of like academy students.  Wow.  So they can see what it's like.  Would you take a day off if you got tased?  Yeah.  I mean, you know what I mean?  I know some cops that have.  Sure.  Is it worth it though?  I don't know if I get hit.  Dude, it's five seconds.  Yeah, you know.  And it's something that the cops use.  I would like to get...  So I don't want to get maced. 
[02:00:00]  But I mean, I don't...  Dude, you don't want to...  Keep up your sexual practices.  It'll happen.  That's right.  I can't finish.  Just tweak those and mace me quick.  You don't want to get maced.  No, I do because it gives you more faith in using it, I think.  All right.  Let's get...  That's why I'm going to shoot myself.  Because it gives me faith in using it.  No, there's a difference now.  I want to be tased and maced together.  Oh, nice.  That's right.  Tased and maced.  Now we're even later.  We're being silly.  Oh, look at us.  Tick tock.  Tick tock, tick tock.  Let's do an Oscar moment.  Oscar's right around the corner. 
[02:00:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  Today's Oscar moment comes from the film Juno.  You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend.  The monkey on your back is the latest trend.  I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you.  I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train.  I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body swinging from side to side. 
[02:01:00]  I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments presented by The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, that's pretty good, man.  We've got to get out of here soon.  Jimmy's got a flight.  I'm not flying a little later.  I'm going to San Francisco for cobs tomorrow through Sunday for the holiday weekend. 
[02:01:30]  San Francisco, 415-928-4320.  Kenny, can I ask Kenny a question on Mike?  Because he said something interesting.  Oh, Kenny?  My girlfriend's not awake at this hour.  Believe me, she's in a coma.  So, I'm asking Kenny to go to the store because I want to get a gift certificate that she wants.  What's the store you're going to?  Seth Moore.  Don't ever speak to me again.  What?  I don't know.  Isn't that the store?  Seth Moore.  Seth Moore.  Yeah.  Is that right before Junior or Sooner? 
[02:02:00]  How are you going to find Seth Moore?  I don't know.  I'll read the sign.  Seth Moore.  Is it Sephora?  Of course it is.  All right.  Seth Moore.  Seth Moore.  I've got to get the chocolate store from you.  Oh, the chocolate.  Chocolate store.  You know what?  My girl was on to me this year, by the way.  I had to do all this stuff myself.  She goes, you know, I appreciate the Valentine's Day thing and stuff, but could you please not  make it so obvious that Kenny got the flowers and handed them to you? 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  You made it work?  Oh.  Yeah.  How much a good thing of candy cost, do you think?  If I wanted to get a nice thing of candy, how much?  $12.50.  Oh, jeez.  Perhaps more than that, I'll be.  Better be more than that.  I don't know how big a thing of truffles to get.  I don't know what to get her.  Oh, get truffles.  Yeah, get her a few.  Get dark chocolate truffles with some stuff inside.  She doesn't like dark.  That a girl.  That a girl. 
[02:03:00]  That a girl.  There you go.  Well, maybe she doesn't like...  I've been trying to preach here.  Maybe she doesn't like dark as far as her candy goes.  No, she doesn't like dark chocolate.  I don't like dark chocolate.  The chocolate thing seems a little...  Act?  ...expected.  She likes chocolate.  Yeah?  Let me get a gift certificate to a place she really wants what she wants.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's good then.  Okay.  And some chocolate.  You can gain something else along with the chocolate.  Here, take.  Take.  Just keep taking.  Oh, jeez.  No, no, no.  Here you go.  More for you.  Take.  Take a little more. 
[02:03:30]  Take.  Here.  See the IV?  Take.  Take the blood.  Take.  Take.  Take.  Take.  Take.  Take.  Oh, here's a card.  Here's some candy.  Here's your gifts.  Here.  More.  One more.  Here's the account password.  Go right in.  Just go in there and take.  Yeah, Tomb Raider.  Go right in there.  Oh, Jimmy in a relationship is...  Wow.  No, it's wonderful.  It's amazing.  It is, isn't it?  Yeah.  Hi, how are you? 
[02:04:00]  What can I do for you?  Hi, how are you?  What have I done wrong?  Can I help you?  Yes, I'm sorry.  I really should have a stupid, like, Ace Hardware vest on.  I'm just here to service you.  With, I'm sorry, what can I do for you written on it.  I'm sorry, Colin.  What can I do for you?  What can I do for you?  Oh, that's funny, Jimmy.  Jesus.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I love you.  Do take.  Take more.  Take.  Take.  Keep taking.  I'm trying to do something different this year.  I don't know what to do, you know?  There hasn't been any suggestions or ideas in the last two weeks. 
[02:04:30]  Well, if there's no hints, then there's no hints.  Oh, there has been?  Oh, my God.  Well, what do you think?  Just point to that ring finger and go.  There you go.  There you go.  Enjoy the rolls that you have on that finger.  I was actually, I was going inside there.  Yeah?  No, I know what to do for Valentine's Day, but see, the joke was that we're selling pretty  much everything on this show.  Oh, I got you.  And I don't know what to do.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the deadline was yesterday, I think.  For everything?  I thought of what we were selling. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  All good stuff, actually.  For my teddy bear?  Yeah, just trying to make a joke.  For my teddy bear, you got the pro flowers, you got the pajama grams.  Those are all terrific gifts.  I should order a for my teddy bear for when we come back.  I'll order it tomorrow.  It'll be much cheaper.  It's February 15th.  I went to Valentine's.  You're the last one.  Yeah.  Do you have the keep bleeding me bear?  Do you have that?  Do you have the bear with the giant syringe?  They say not to make up bears, Jimmy.  I'm telling you if they do. 
[02:05:30]  Take.  Yeah, here you go.  Take.  Take.  It's a bear with eight arms, and all of them have hands that are open waiting.  Take.  The octopus bear.  The bear with 300 pockets in its outfit.  Jimmy, why don't you just get engaged?  In what?  In what?  Hey, it's called a radio seg.  We got men out there.  They're hiring proposal planners for Valentine's Day.  What the hell is that?  Bad enough with the wedding planner crap. 
[02:06:00]  Now, there's proposal planners.  Nice.  What do these leeches do?  I'll probably give you a knife.  For incompetent people.  Here, cut this off.  Put it in a box, and she'll say I do.  Let's take a little listen here.  From little women to Rocky.  I was wondering if you wouldn't mind marrying me very much.  Marrying me.  Getting down on one knee has been giving men sweaty palms.  Men like Dave McDermott.  Every time I kept thinking about how to do it.  Had another drink.  I wasn't sure if it was the right way. 
[02:06:30]  McDermott.  In an age when you can hire someone to pick up your dry cleaning or walk your dog, he thought, why not pay someone to put the pro in proposal?  One of the big emerging trends in proposals these days is hiring a proposal planner.  It can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to more than $15,000.  What?  For some men, no price is too high.  There's so much pressure on them, and they haven't planned things like this before.  And so a girl goes to a planner to help her plan the actual day, but this is his day. 
[02:07:00]  You know what?  This is not good.  $15,000.  It's not good.  That's an expensive one.  That's for the rape fantasy proposal.  Five gentlemen from above 110th Street will show up with a proposal.  I understand we're all hiring people to do stuff we don't want to do, but when it comes to getting engaged, you've got to figure it out.  What?  That should be something.  Yeah, I might sound a little corny, but it should be something that is heartfelt that you should be able to do based on your feelings to go and propose to a woman if you want to be insane and enter in that institution. 
[02:07:30]  Shut up.  But I'm just saying based on, you know.  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Give me a chance.  But, you know, to get a planner to propose.  That's bad.  You've got to know your lady, and you've got to figure something out that's cool.  You're a lovely lady.  Just do a little thinking.  Figure it out.  I have an idea.  What you do is, for $15,000, they'll tape a note to a bullet and put it right in her forehead. 
[02:08:00]  Like, as the bullet's in the forehead, the note's on a string dangling out.  She can read it like a price tag.  Good God.  Yes.  For more elaborate proposals, hiring a Broadway theater complete with fake cast and audience to stage a play with the proposal written in.  An engagement ring hidden in a shell on the ocean floor.  If you need someone to tell you to do that, then you're a zero in life.  Wait, the play is a good idea, though. 
[02:08:30]  Well, yeah.  I mean, the elaborate stuff's pretty interesting.  But, I mean, if you can't figure out how to put a freaking ring in a shell on a beach somewhere.  But you're not.  That was at the bottom of the ocean.  I guess you're going stupid diving.  That's what she said.  I actually thought of that one.  Wouldn't that be funny?  I do.  And then a shark bites her in half.  Exactly.  With the hand with the $10,000 ring.  With the ring.  Just eating.  Right.  Old stumpy.  One of those little yellow nip-nip fish that I talk about from time to time.  You're ready to do the feed and that just, yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Grabs your ring and goes.  And scurries off with it.  Now you've got to chase the little effer.  Gel on the ocean floor.  Dave opted for something more low-key.  A simple carriage ride through Central Park.  With a photographer hiding in the bushes to document it all.  Hotels are also capitalizing on the trend.  Planners set up special proposal suites for the couple to spend the night in.  Not unlike a honeymoon.  Here at the Mandarin Oriental, it comes with champagne and rose petals. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, and also a price tag of $10,000 for one night.  Instead of just getting a room and proposing.  Give it to her in a Motel 8.  Throw the ring on her back while you're hitting it.  There you go.  What do you say?  Now rinse the ring off and put it on.  What do you say?  It's never going to get better than this moment.  Let's be honest with each other.  So, there you go.  I love the idea of doing it at a play, but get a really good play like Rent.  Boo-hoo-hoo, will you marry me? 
[02:10:00]  Throw it on her back.  It's like, yeah, it was a little tight.  That ought to make it easier to put on.  Critics see this trend as an extension of the $160 billion wedding industry,  moving from the bride's day to the groom's.  I think that certainly the groom is a very attractive proposition  for people in the wedding industry,  and one that has been under-exploited in a way.  But Dave McDermott doesn't feel exploited.  He just feels happy. 
[02:10:30]  She said yes.  I know how I would do it.  Yeah, Jimmy?  I would hire someone to duct tape the ring to a brick  and just lob it through the bay window.  She's watching her soaps right on the floor,  just sculls across the floor,  and she'd scream and go,  no, no, no, pick it up, honey.  With an ethnic or racial epithet written on it.  A threat.  A threat.  A death threat.  A dead animal.  Get out of the neighborhood, you J.  Put the ring on her dead cat 
[02:11:00]  and just throw it through the window.  You hang her favorite pet.  It's a bittersweet moment, isn't it, honey?  You lynch her favorite pet,  and you put the ring on its now dry nose.  Oh, my God.  It's so negative.  That is so wrong.  Did you just do it totally unromantic?  Like, after you're done, 
[02:11:30]  you put it in the toilet,  you're like, just trust me,  fish through there for a couple of minutes.  After you're done, yeah.  It's worth it, believe me.  It's on the bottom.  What is this?  Come on, pull it out.  Movie tickets.  Let's say hi to Sean in Philly.  Sean.  That's a piece of calamari I had last night.  Don't put that on your finger.  Yes, it would be.  Oh, it's the ring,  but there's gum stuck to it.  I know, they've been telling me  since second grade not to.  Let's go to Sean in Philly. 
[02:12:00]  Sean.  A peanut in the setting?  No, take it off.  Brush it off.  Looks like someone's been eating  ice cream with Carmel.  I'll just rinse that, trust me.  Oh, my God.  That's a great way to give it.  Swallow it,  and you throw it up  in front of her at the table.  That's what you do.  You're like,  I have something to ask you,  and she's like, what?  And you stand up  with your fingers down,  and you puke on your food.  It's the new Brundle proposal. 
[02:12:30]  I love it.  It's very cute.  It's wonderful.  Sean, we're going to end with you.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to know  if you asked your future Philly dad  for pretty please  for permission before you asked.  Yeah, that's the only way to do it.  Absolutely, I did.  Oh, you did?  Traditionalist.  Sir?  Did you go, sir?  No, we...  Sir?  We had a fine talk.  Yeah?  No joke there, really.  You didn't call him sir? 
[02:13:00]  No.  Oh, okay.  No, Big Ken was cool.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  You know Big Ken.  Yeah.  We had a good moment,  to be honest with you.  I'm not sure when you go about that,  though.  You know, when you're hanging out  drinking and stuff,  it's one thing,  but when you're, you know,  asking for a daughter's hand...  If I said sir to Big Ken,  he would have openly laughed at me.  Really?  That's why I like these,  this Philly crew.  They're the real deal.  No, we had a good talk,  good moment.  There's no joke there.  It was just,  it was all right.  You gotta ask the father  if he's still around. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Not only would I...  If you can find him.  Not only would I not ask,  but I would break the news  by going this,  guess what we're doing?  Smell my finger.  Oh, this is great.  What is this? 
[02:14:00]  This is how we end the show today.  A little sing-along.  Wait, I love retard singing.  Is that what this is?  It's not like you  You say sorry.  Yes.  No, no, no.  This was sorry.  This time I'm staking  For you,  my heart was breaking.  I've been wrong.  I've been deaf  Till the bottom of every bottle  is like words in my head. 
[02:14:30]  Scream,  are you having fun?  Yeah.  Blow your nose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  You didn't know that.  Big fan of Nickelback.  Yeah.  I still do.  Couldn't have been so bad.  Coincidentally,  God took some brain back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is how you remind me  of what I really am. 
[02:15:00]  This is how you remind me  of what I really am.  Come on.  Come on.  It's not like you.  Say sorry.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Go.  Go.  Go.

[02:25:30]  Look at the book in front of you.  Oh.  What's the book?  What's this book for?  That's her book.  Why is this book in front of me?  Because she's the guest.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  That makes sense now.  Now it's all coming together.  I thought we finally had a hot listener that wanted to stop by and check out the show.  You knew.  Sorry.  Sorry to the people that have been here.  You're all hot in your own way.  Exactly.  What's the other way?  Ah. 
[02:26:00]  So what is she?  Oh.  Hotties.  So what is she?  Like a sexpert?  She's a penthouse columnist.  She was a Playboy Playboy.  A penthouse pet of the year.  She's smoking hot.  Mm-hmm.  She came to the US at age 16 from the Soviet Union as a foreign exchange student.  I make sexy for you.  As part of the slave trade, and she has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, and she dated Trump.  I got a Ph.D. in broads.  She dated Donald Trump for a period of time, and Trump denies it.  Really?  He says no, and she says yes. 
[02:26:30]  Really?  She's very lovely.  Penthouse Pet of the Year 2004.  Should we get her in here?  I think so, sure.  Let's just check that audio first to make sure we're going over that stuff, right?  Yeah, it's the same feedback.  Well, just say.  Three times, so.  Okay, we'll just.  We'll play it.  We'll just play it.  Supposedly, Jane Fonda said cunt on the Today Show.  Says one guy.  One guy?  Well, now it's coming in by a few different people.  Says you.  Yeah, well.  I actually thought it was cunt, so I'm going to just say Jane Fonda.  Get it? 
[02:27:00]  Yes, she's a cunt.  No.  I don't know.  Do we really want to?  Yeah.  I mean, well, weren't we waiting for?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  There you go.  Hi, Victoria.  Hi.  Wow, you're really, like, hot.  Well, thank you.  Hello?  And your boobies are sticking out.  Well, no, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  She's got a cleavage coming out.  Oh, but you make it sound like she's, um.  You can see, like, side boobie. 
[02:27:30]  Side boobie?  A little bit of side boobie.  That's a good thing.  That's a very good thing.  Of course it is.  Happy Valentine's Day.  My mic is not on.  No, it is.  Oh, your headphones must be awry.  Yeah.  Fan.  So, um, you were Pet of the Year 2004.  Yes.  And, um, the book is called Dr. Z on Scoring.  How to Pick Up, Seduce, and Hook Up with Hot Women.  Score.  Um, okay, help.  Help. 
[02:28:00]  Well, you guys probably don't need a lot of help, because you know what?  You got the gift of gab, and that's something women love.  Whoa, I love the accent.  Yes, the gift of gab.  Yes, the good old Russian accent.  It is good, gift of gab.  You're doing good Russian impersonation there.  Thank you.  Sounds like the real people.  So, you came over from, uh.  I came over from Ukraine in, um, 1989 as the first Ukrainian exchange student.  Really? 
[02:28:30]  And then I decided I'm not going back.  Wow.  What, what did the family do when you came to the house as the exchange student?  Uh, I've been through some dysfunctional host family, so let's just put it that way.  Did, uh, so, uh, the first one you went to, were there any, uh, guys in the house your age?  No, no, it was actually two girls and a single mom.  Oh, okay.  Well, that does, uh, all right, that sounds okay.  Yeah.  Was that the only one, or you?  No, I've been through a couple, because people don't realize, actually, exchange students 
[02:29:00]  are a lot of work.  Yeah.  They are, so, um, then it adds too much trouble driving around.  Kind of setting up all those hidden cameras in the bathroom.  Yes.  Yeah, so, uh, yes, I came as an exchange student.  Wait, I have a question.  Did you go to any, any host homes that have, like, uh, uh, you know, a father?  Because that would be, like, the day after she gets there, the wife just turns up missing.  No, I didn't.  She went for milk.  She hasn't been back.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Oh, I went through a few where the husbands got a little bit too excited, and then they 
[02:29:30]  ended up transferring me to a different host family, because the wife's like, ah, I don't  like this.  This is a little too hot.  Oh, boy.  Cock-blocking wife.  So, I actually went through, like, six host families.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  She got through the door, the wife would go, no.  Leave.  Just to give the visual.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'9".  5'9".  Uh, don't have to ask her weight.  She's got the nice weight, obviously.  120.  120.  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  You got the big boobies.  You didn't have them as an exchange student, I'm assuming.  Wow.  I always, I always was curvaceous. 
[02:30:00]  I've always had the curvaceous body going on.  The 34D?  The 34D.  They must have just shit their pants.  So good.  It's like, hi, I'm here.  She's got her little bag, her little American blue jeans, bringing from Soviet Union.  That was me, yes.  She'd have for 10 minutes, they want to marry her to give her citizenship.  I thought you were saying, I would.  Right.  Well, you know, now that you mention that, actually, that's how I did get my citizenship.  I contacted an immigration attorney, and he said to me, you know, I can't...  Is his name Travis? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Actually, he said, I can't extend your visa.  A student visa is not extendable, but I can marry you.  So that's how I ended up getting my citizenship.  So wait, this guy, this guy you called, he just offered to marry you?  Well, pretty...  Well, not then.  I went and actually met him.  I was an exchange student in Florida, and then I went up to meet him in Philadelphia.  He was part of this Ukrainian community.  They did pro bono work.  Of course.  Pro boner work.  I knew you'd like that pun.  Yes.  All pun intended. 
[02:31:00]  And so when he met me, he said, oh, well, we can get married.  So we got married a couple of weeks later in Las Vegas.  I was 17 years old.  How long until you had sex with him?  A couple of days.  Nice.  17-year-old exchange student.  And you had sex just to make sure the marriage was legal?  Well, you got to consummate the marriage, right?  Then you really want to have sex with this guy?  We actually...  Yeah, I mean, he was cool.  He was cool.  He had a way with women.  He was married a few times before, and actually like three times after me.  So he was quite a ladies' man.  So wait, how... 
[02:31:30]  You could just do this.  You could just...  You stayed married.  I'm going to guess you stayed for two years, married.  No, I stayed married like five years.  Oh, okay.  You didn't just leave after the two obligatory years?  No, it's not.  First of all, it's not two.  It takes a little longer than that.  But no, you know, then you can get used to each other and stuff.  The problem is he had a substance abuse habit and a gambling habit.  He was an attorney, and one time he gambled $80,000 on one night in Atlantic City.  And then I said, you know what?  That's enough.  And that's enough.  That's the problem.  You married Anthony Cumia?  So that's him, and he's a problem. 
[02:32:00]  That's the problem.  I like playing cards myself.  How long before you started having sex with other guys in your marriage?  A few years into it.  I mean, I was young.  It sounds like you really weren't marrying the guy because you were in love.  You were cheating?  Of course she was.  I was cheating, yeah.  It's so hot.  Gosh, I love her.  She rules.  Yeah.  I heard you had a problem with man cow.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is, he kind of has the whole ADD thing.  Like, he brings you on the air, and then he doesn't talk to you, and then he starts  talking to you, and he's just like, he's over the place.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Yeah, that's right.  So it's like, what's the point of me being here?  Yeah, yeah, whatever you're saying.  I hate turd, turd.  I'm on the line.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm out right.  Oh, that guy.  So it's like useless.  It's totally useless.  Yeah, he needs Adderall.  That's Adderall prescription right there.  Oh, you think he's on the Adderall?  No, he needs one.  But isn't Adderall like liquid, not liquid, isn't that the pill form of cocaine or something?  Well, so it's Ritalin.  I mean, all of them are opposite.  But Adderall gets you the same feeling cocaine does.  I just learned this the other day, Anthony.  Did you?  It does.  Well, it's a paradoxical effect, but people who have ADD, it actually calms them down. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  What?  Yeah, it calms them down.  I need to calm them down.  I wasn't paying attention.  So wait, are you a therapist?  I'm a therapist.  I don't currently work as a therapist.  I'm a Penthouse columnist.  I write a column for Penthouse, Dear Dr. Z.  Do you get into some dirty stuff in your column?  I get into all kinds of stuff.  Like boner stuff?  Like, you know, you're hoping guys, you know, pop the boner?  Oh, well, it's more like actually advice advice.  But, you know, guys write in all kinds of stuff. 
[02:33:30]  Like the other day, this guy writes in and he has a fetish for a woman's toenail clippings.  So he's asking, is that normal?  I collect, you know, a woman's toenail clippings.  So you know you're a freak.  Shoot yourself is the advice, right?  No, no.  You know, I'm very, I'm very, you know, I try to normalize the experience because, you  know, different strokes for different folks, literally and figuratively.  But don't you think that's just a fraternity or something like, you know, pranking you?  No, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You can't be a guy that's into toenail clippings.  You would be surprised.  I've been, you know, I've been doing this kind of sex advice for a long time. 
[02:34:00]  If you can think of a fetish, somebody's got it.  A toenail fetish guy is probably one of those guys that likes a mistress.  They're human ashtrays.  They're into like, not like having their mouth, not mouth spitting, that's too clean, but they're  into being ashtrays and having cigarettes stubbed out in their mouth.  Yeah, all kinds of stuff.  So that's probably what he is.  He's like a garbage can.  We got a special case in studio.  We invited Jim in.  He's addicted to sex.  Okay.  We don't really know much about him, but he's got some, uh, some issues and we figured  that maybe he could talk to you about it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Tell me about it. 
[02:34:30]  I have a therapist, but, uh, I just don't know if it's going well.  You know?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Non-variety manic depressive.  Very tedious.  Well, there might've been a time that he was into some, uh, unusual things.  Okay.  You don't work as, you don't work as like a sit-down therapist anymore, huh?  Not right now.  I used to.  Did you?  And I might do it in the future.  I'm just so busy because I have the book and I'm working on another book and I'm, you  know, book tool right now.  Do you have practice in New York?  Where's your practice?  I live in New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So I used to work for New Jersey.  Who wants to go see you? 
[02:35:00]  I would see her as a therapist, but at a professional level, of course.  As long as she's wearing lingerie.  No, I wouldn't care.  Would you wear the lingerie?  No, no, no.  That would not be professional.  Yeah, she's professional.  What do you, uh, how much is a therapy session when you were a child?  What a therapy session?  Um, they're usually like $100.  And, you know, the insurance covers some of it.  No, I don't know about the release.  The release you could do somewhere else.  Oh, okay.  I might be embarrassed to be a therapist, to see her for therapy.  But I would do it, but she's unfortunately not doing it.  What part of Jersey?  You don't have to say what town.  Uh, we in New Jersey. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, okay.  That's not far.  Could you tell her what you're into and see what her take is on it, Jimmy?  Or, I don't know.  Well, I've done some odd things, aggressive things.  Um, like, uh, I'd like just spanking and, you know, hair pulling and biting.  That's very normal.  Holding spanking.  That's, you know.  I mean, those things are actually very common.  You know, believe it or not, something like mild bondage and discipline is extremely popular  with most men and women.  And that's...  I'm more fetishist than a sub or a dom, I guess you could say.  And he's just really scratching the surface. 
[02:36:00]  I think, uh, your beauty is getting in the way of him being honest.  Well, no, no, no.  We just don't know each other.  I don't want her to never want to see me because she thinks I'm a creep.  But, I see, in the book, I talk about, like, a lot of women have submission fantasies.  So, something like spanking could be a good thing.  Most women actually would very much enjoy that.  Uh, now, when it depends, you know, it's all, it's all a continuum.  It depends, you know, what kind of, when it comes to bondage discipline, where you lay.  But there's a, I'm sure there's people out there who would enjoy, uh, your type of fetish. 
[02:36:30]  Yes, there are.  Anyone who has fiber in their diet.  Here's what I'm asking you a question.  Oh, boy.  Now, what?  I happen...  I love them, Jimmy.  My nipples are very sensitive.  Mm-hmm.  To the point where I almost can't function sexually without having my nipples.  Which I feel bad because I'm having sex with a girl.  And she literally has to do it.  You ever see Karate Kid?  When they wax on and wax off.  I like my nipples brushed lightly.  No pinching.  Just light little brushes on the nipples.  Once it brushed.  How do I break that?  It's dysfunctional.  Oh, how do you...  Well, over time, you could probably desensitize them if you, uh, 
[02:37:00]  slowly build up the, uh, touch from, uh, you know what it is?  You gotta come by...  You don't want them to be so sensitive, you're saying?  No, no, no.  You want them more...  I don't want my erection to be contingent upon my nipples being flicked.  Like, I would like to be able to free myself up.  I feel like I'm fucking a girl and she's laying back and I'm playing with my nipples  like a praying mantis.  And it's gotta be very uncomfortable for her to look up.  And you have to make that weird noise.  What was it?  You've done it on the show a few times.  That's...  Well, you know what? 
[02:37:30]  But actually, nipple stimulation is also very common with guys.  But what you gotta do is you gotta condition yourself, uh, during your autoerotic sessions  to be able to achieve orgasm without it.  So when you're playing with yourself, uh, do you, do you normally stimulate your nipples  when you play with yourself?  Yeah, I'm...  Here's what it is.  I'm on my back.  I'll have, like, a lot of times my right hand will be lubed.  This is what...  I, I actually, because I'm on the computer, so I'll put, wrap toilet tissue around the  eros so I don't get lube all over my typing fingers so my computer doesn't get shitty.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  And then I'll actually just whack, and I have the...  This is... 
[02:38:00]  It's so fucking creepy.  Because I have...  I'm whacking my bag, and I got the left hand dangling on my nipple.  It's like a cadaver hand.  Just flicking.  Just flicking the right...  That is so odd, man.  My left middle finger is just kind of lightly brushing my nipple.  It's almost like I'm on the autopsy table, and, like, that's all I can do to let it hold  my life.  Well, that's the thing.  What you gotta do is you have to, you have to, during your autoerotic sessions, slowly  get, slowly learn to, uh, masturbate without, uh, nipple stimulation.  And it might be harder sometimes.  It might require longer for you, for you to orgasm, but that's the way to do it, is, is, uh, 
[02:38:30]  condition yourself during autoerotic sessions.  You know, with a woman, it's too hard.  It's too hard to break that, uh, try to do it during autoerotic.  See, the guys don't realize, what they do during masturbation translates directly into  intercourse.  So the guys are like, they come within three seconds, they usually also masturbate very  quickly, and, uh, that translates.  Yeah, so I always tell them, take your time, uh, whatever you do during masturbation is  going to translate into your other sex life.  See, I'm just the opposite.  Literally, like, my problem is, I will, because it's an escape, so I will jack off for hours. 
[02:39:00]  Like, like, starting, and, like, I can hold out for a long time during sex, but eventually  my dick gets bored and I lose it.  Like, I can't just fuck straight through.  Like, I can't just have regular sex.  From beginning, you know, just regular vaginal sex, nice sex, and then finish.  It's always going to be stop and start, like this really weird masturbatory thing during  sex.  Yeah, because probably that's what you conditioned yourself to during masturbation.  So if you want to learn to actually orgasm quicker, then, uh, you have to speed it up 
[02:39:30]  during, uh, masturbation and maybe try a dry style as opposed to lube.  No, no, I actually, I go dry a lot.  Lube is helpful because my dick is desensitized.  Just from, believe me, it's like a fucking squeeze doll.  Um, so, do you, yeah, maybe she's right, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Um, she doesn't look too bad naked either.  We got naked pictures of you.  Oh, wow.  I am looking up on danny.com.  Wow.  Wait, is that dannyash.com or dannyash?  Uh, yes, it's danny.com.  Dannyash is very sexy.  She has, uh, danny, D-A-N-N-I dot com. 
[02:40:00]  I.  Is that a different person?  Uh, yeah, it's the same person.  I mean, that's me.  Wow, you're shaving into a V, huh?  Yes, V for Victoria.  A flying V.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, that's me.  But we, so, because Dannyash has big, slow-fade nipples.  I love Dannyash.  He has giant breasts.  You're all about nipples, huh?  No, I'm actually, not necessarily.  I like, on a woman, I like her big areolas.  I think that's very sexy.  Imagine that coming to the door.  Hi, I am exchange student.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Hey.  You'd see the guy in the white pocket.  You can check out more on my site, planetvictoria.com. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  Well, we're going there next.  Now, do you ever do any porn or no?  Well, I've done soft girl-girl stuff.  I've never done hardcore.  You want to start?  No, I think at this point.  You know what it is?  I did it to pay for my extensive and expensive graduate education, so now I don't have an  incentive to do it.  Did you ever strip in a strip club?  No.  Anthony is not a fan of the Russian stripper.  No.  But she's got a nice personality.  You're the first Russian in a while.  The former Soviet Union, the strippers that came over, it was all about, it was just a 
[02:41:00]  cultural shock for me.  I was used to maybe the girl next door kind of thing.  Hi.  How you doing?  And then it just turned into, hey, I make sexy for the money you give to me.  The money I make for you, the sexy.  And I'm like, no, don't make the sexy.  Well, the thing is, I gotta admit that Russian women don't smile a whole lot.  It's a cultural thing.  And I mean, more so now, I think being brought up in the Soviet Union, like, you weren't allowed 
[02:41:30]  to smile.  People are like, hey, why are you grinning?  What's your problem?  No, babushka.  Yeah.  So, like, the first thing when I came to this country, I was like, Jesus, people are smiling.  What's up?  What's going on?  It's a cultural thing.  And it's funny, in my book, I talk about the importance of smile and creating genuine  smile, because guys who don't smile don't get laid.  You have to get smiled.  She's fucking right.  The same guy who wrote the game, Neil Law, whatever his name is, said the same thing.  If you're not smiling at her, you're gay. 
[02:42:00]  They did the study, and when they said, well, what's the first thing you notice about a  guy?  And the women know he's smiling teeth.  The knife.  Yep.  Look at us all smiling.  Jimmy's making the most insane smile.  This is called Pan-American smile.  It doesn't work.  I talk about it in my book.  So, you've got to do Duchenne's smile.  Duchenne's smile is a genuine smile, and your eyes have to crinkle.  The whole, the face has to lift.  You have to think positive thoughts.  No, that's not it.  I'm trying. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know how to smile for her.  Come on.  Let me think positive thoughts.  All right.  Here we go.  Positive thoughts.  Positive thoughts.  Okay.  He'll be sad because he's just thinking of his HIV test.  A positive thought.  No, he doesn't.  He cured it with aspirin.  But he's working on it.  Like, just joyous like this?  Yeah.  Warm, genuine smile.  Think happy, warm thoughts, and it'll project.  Jimmy's making ridiculous smiles.  Everyone is smiling right now.  They don't seem very sincere. 
[02:43:00]  How pathetic is this?  Sincere smile is a big difference, and that's what people find the most attractive in a  partner.  Very, very good.  Can I see a sincere smile from you?  See, the eyes have to crinkle, this whole thing.  I mean, if you do, you should just stretch your lips.  That just looks creepy.  Yeah, when you just go, you know.  Do you still, like, get topless and stuff?  Do I get topless occasionally?  Yeah.  Depending on the occasion.  Why?  I was just asking.  I was wondering about that.  I've been checking out my pictures there, and it's giving you all kinds of ideas. 
[02:43:30]  Why?  Look at the pictures.  Do you still shave a V into it?  Is it still me or no?  No, and I got tired of that.  Did you?  Wait, can we guess what you got down there?  I just, uh...  Oh, it looks like one of those Russian hats.  Nice.  Nice and furry.  Like someone working at a gulag.  No, no.  She's got a big furry hat on.  Wait, why not bald?  Why not bald?  Too much work.  Too much maintenance.  I mean, I don't mind.  You know what it is?  It's good for doing foreplay.  It's nice when your man shaves you, that kind of thing.  So you've got a natural triangle that's shaved down. 
[02:44:00]  It kind of...  Yeah, that's usually what I do.  There you go, trim.  That's good.  Trim, that's easier to...  You let it all grow in, but you keep it short.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  That's a good way.  And occasionally, I mean, occasionally, it's good to go bald.  I mean, it increases sensitivity.  I talk about, you know, guys.  It's good for guys to go bald.  It actually makes them look...  Like infants.  Bigger.  No, no.  I tried it, please.  I tried it once.  It looks ridiculous.  But it does make it look bigger.  And that's one of the things.  You know, I have a chapter in my book on the whole thing on penis size, because guys obsess  over... 
[02:44:30]  Every question I get in Penthouse Call, how do I get bigger?  It's like, it's a guy's obsession.  And so I dispel the myth that it's important to be big.  It's like, fit matters between people, size doesn't.  You want to look at penises today?  Well, the...  I'm sure.  I mean, I'm...  Jimmy...  I can't just shove the doc my dick.  I can't do it.  She's open.  But I am shaved completely.  I'm open.  She's right.  Because it makes your dick look bigger.  It does make...  My pubic hair is straight, and it's seven and a half inches long, my hair.  So my dick would look like a soldier popping up at the nom. 
[02:45:00]  It's like fucking...  Just creeping.  You've got a Beatles cut over your dick.  Right.  Yeah, I like shaving at all.  It's cleaner.  It's much cleaner.  Much more hygienic, I think.  All right, so what are we going to do today?  We got the book.  We got...  It's called Dr. Z on Scoring, right?  How to Pick Up, Seduce, and Hook Up with Hot Women by Dr. Victoria...  Wow, what a last name.  Z-D-R?  He has a wrong name.  Three consonants in a row.  Just roll with it.  Z-D-R-O-K.  Z-D-R-O-K.  Z-D-R-O-K.  Now, you say you...  I was going to ask her, too. 
[02:45:30]  Did you go out with Trump or not?  I went out with Trump, but I didn't hook up with him.  He says you didn't, though, right?  I know.  He was like, oh, I would never go out with a penthouse pet.  I would never go out with a penthouse pet.  There's only a million pictures of you.  Completely his type.  Right.  He denied he ever went out with any penthouse pets, and I know quite a few that have.  So what happened?  You went out with him, and what happened?  Back then, I was a playmate anyways.  He was just being, you know, narcissistic and self-consumed and obnoxious.  Narcissistic? 
[02:46:00]  Did you say narcissistic?  Narcissistic, yeah.  Narcissistic.  That's just the accent.  So I just said we didn't hit it off.  How long did you go out on him for?  Like three or four dates.  And he really thinks he's all that, right?  Oh, yeah.  You know, one of the first things he said, he goes, people don't realize how good looking  I am.  And they also don't realize how tall I am.  I don't, on camera, like, you know, I'm really tall.  Oh, shut up.  He talked about himself a lot?  Oh, that's all he talked about.  And that's the worst thing you could do in the book.  I talk in the book.  If you want to turn off the woman, then talk about yourself. 
[02:46:30]  You got to talk about her and try to elicit her beliefs and build similarities.  But all he did is talk about himself and also put down his exes.  Like, oh, Marla, ever since I dumped her, she looks like shit.  You know, she cut off her hair.  And, you know, Nirvana, she's like really looking bad these days.  You don't want to hear about that.  So why do you last so long with him?  Well, because at that time.  You see right through that shit.  Money.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  No, there's got to be a reason.  This is how he called.  At that time, I was working for Playboy.  And I was on the cover of Playboy Catalog.  So he calls him up. 
[02:47:00]  And he goes, I got to book this girl, Victoria.  I'm doing this important campaign at the Tropicana Casino.  Then I find out three days, four days into it, there is no campaign at the Tropicana Casino.  Nice, huh?  So that's why.  I suddenly like him now.  You got to respect that.  That's what I would do.  What was the catalog for?  It was the Playboy Catalog at that time.  You know, there's like lingerie.  You're supposed to order lingerie out of it, not the models.  That son of a bitch.  He's using the catalog, I want this woman.  You know what?  You got to give him one for that, though.  That's pretty impressive. 
[02:47:30]  Pretty sharp.  He's confident.  And he scores on the confidence part.  He invented a pageant just so he could get some puha.  So where was your first date?  How did that happen?  You got a call.  He wants to meet you.  Yeah, I think we went to, you know, I met him by, I went at the restaurant.  I don't even remember.  This was like five or six years.  Did he pick you up or did he have a car come get you?  No, I actually drove in the city and I ended up just meeting him.  I didn't want to be stuck with car situations and stuff.  We went to dinner and stuff.  But yeah, he talked like the whole time about himself and stuff and how like, you know, 
[02:48:00]  once we hook up, basically, you know, I'm such a great lover, you'll never be able to  be with another guy ever again.  I'm like an amazing lover.  Did he really know what he said, did he?  Yeah.  It was kind of stuff he said.  Wow.  He had to give him the confidence there.  How did you not bang him just for the story?  Like just to trash him?  But you know what it is?  It's like, it's called reactants in psychology.  If you tell somebody to do something, they're going to do just the opposite.  Right.  Don't fuck me.  The fringes upon our fringes.  Exactly.  In my book, I say, when you play hard to get with a girl, when you're like, you know what, 
[02:48:30]  honey, I'm not really ready for the intercourse part.  You know, I'm very selective.  That makes women want you like crazy.  When you tell a woman, hey, you know, you got to sleep with me because I'm the best lover  ever.  Then she's like, I'm not sleeping with you.  And that's what happened to me.  I'm like, I'll sleep with every other guy, but not you.  Because you told me that.  That's wonderful.  That's exactly where I go wrong.  Because I set women up.  I'm like, you got to see this giant dick I have.  Guaranteed, it's the biggest one you've ever seen.  Guaranteed.  See, one of the guys that I was, I used to date this one guy, and he would make out with 
[02:49:00]  me and kiss and go down on me, but he would not fuck me.  And I was like, it would drive me completely crazy.  And I'm like, why?  He's like, well, you know, it has to be a special experience.  I can't do it.  So eventually, I just ripped his clothes off.  And then I found out it's like his MO.  Like, he drives women crazy by playing sort of like hard to get.  What a smoothie.  But I mentioned all these techniques in my book.  Colmo Blue Balls, I think.  But it worked for me, because I mean, women rip off, you know, his clothes, because he's  like very smooth. 
[02:49:30]  If you come across too lustful and too obvious, it's a turn off to women.  You gotta be a...  Did you make out with Trump?  You had to make out with him.  I think we kissed once.  Was he a good kisser?  Bad breath?  Yeah, no.  Bad breath, right?  Just nothing impressive.  Like a tight-lipped kind of action.  A tight-lipped kiss?  A good deep tongue kiss?  Seems like it would be.  No, just a little tight-lipped.  I know this is hack, but what's up with his hair?  Is it real?  What is he doing with that?  It's just...  It's real.  It's just teased and sprayed.  It's hairspray.  Lots of hairspray.  It really is real hair?  Is he doing a comb-over, though? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it's a comb-over, and then it's also teased up, you know, back-commed, and then  it's sprayed.  So you made out with him.  Come on.  Did you rub his penis through his pants?  No, because...  Through his pants!  No, I did not do anything.  Exactly because he kept on saying, oh, we gotta do it.  Yeah, you gotta be so impressed, and I'm like, I'm not doing it.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I'm not doing it.  It's a reaction thing.  Jimmy just feels back as he did.  Yeah, I gave him.  So he's feeling a little guilty.  Yeah.  So wait, you should have just done it, like, just to get him all fucking crazy, and then  not done it.  Well, that's the thing.  I didn't do any...  We never went further than that, because it's like, okay, you promised me they campaigned. 
[02:50:30]  There was no campaign, so...  I don't think so.  This is just a real turn-off.  I mean, the guy just so self-absorbed, and he talks about himself, puts all his exes down.  I'm like, you know, why do you want to be with somebody who's, like, talks badly about  women non-stop?  So if he had been nicer to you, or just played the game a little bit, if he had just not  been a douche, you probably would have banged him.  Yeah, I never know.  Might have.  I might have had a chance.  It's an emphatic yes.  So we...  Now, tell me honestly, what was your attraction to him? 
[02:51:00]  Be very truthful.  I wasn't attracted to him.  That's the thing.  That's why I didn't go out on any more dates.  But you went out on him three times, which means...  Like, he's not a bad-looking dude.  Trump's not a bad...  You can't say he's ugly.  He's not.  But he bats...  It's his personality.  ...genetically out of his gig.  Out of his leg.  Yeah, his personality is a turn-off.  I mean, you know what?  Women are not that concerned about looks.  I talk about my book.  Women are not as superficial as guys.  They'll, you know, they'll go out with...  I've seen really gorgeous women with butt-ugly guys that are, you know, that are distinct,  that have notoriety, that are interesting, funny. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, the guys, there's so many other ways that they can make up for their looks.  But, yeah, Trump is not bad-looking, but his personality is a major turn-off.  He's, like, obnoxious.  He's like, you know, it's all about me, and I'm the center of the universe, and he doesn't  know how to listen.  He only talks, and he only talks about himself the entire time.  Are you with someone now, or...?  Yes.  I'm in a relationship.  That's good to hear.  Happy for you.  Not good.  It's really, I'm always happy to hear.  God bless.  Do you put out on the first date, if the situation's right? 
[02:52:00]  You know what?  I used to.  I love her.  But then, over time, I learned that it's not good.  And for men or women, because if you wanted to build the limerence, that kind of passion,  infatuation, and if you put out too early, you don't allow the limerence to crystallize  sufficiently, which is, it's good to, you know, to have a little bit of frustration.  Frustration and anticipation builds passion.  So you're making a formula.  Yeah.  So I have, like, the book, I talk, there's a whole formula to building limerence and passion  infatuation.  God damn, the cover of the book is fucking sexy. 
[02:52:30]  It's her.  Well.  And she's sucking on a little, her glasses, like the end of the glasses, like the nerdy  glasses, and her bosoms are bursting, and she's wearing thigh highs.  It looks like a thigh high with your, are you wearing thigh highs now?  Can I ask you that?  No, not today.  But I love thigh highs with garters.  I wear them a lot.  Just today is too cold.  They rule.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  It's a very sexy cover.  Thank you.  You know what, though?  She's, you're way hotter in person.  Thank you.  I mean, it's not a bad picture, but she's better in person, right?  Yeah, it's rare that you see somebody more, that's a great picture. 
[02:53:00]  It certainly is.  It's rare that you see somebody more attractive in person because of Photoshop, like, you know  what they just do to make pictures better, so you actually look better in person.  I always say, yeah, but you know, for some reason I always get that.  Like, people always say, oh, you look better in person, and I say, well, it's better  than the other way around, I suppose.  Better than saying, oh, that doesn't look like you, but people say, that doesn't look  like you, it's never a good sign.  Could you take your jacket off?  Sure.  Good.  Wow, that was easy.  Well, it's hot in here, guys.  It's like, it's like a hundred degrees.  Well, why don't we make it a hundred and ten? 
[02:53:30]  Exactly.  If it was a fat chick in here, we'd have it, we'd have it five below.  Put the park on.  So, it says here, oh, God, she looked wonderful.  She looks better with, like, with her jacket off.  She looks a lot better.  You're like, you're so, you're so, she adjusted her boob, too, I saw.  Oh, yeah.  She's so hot, it's almost depressing.  Like, I wouldn't even, I'm not even sexually excited, I'm like, ah, never.  You can't even get, it's just sad.  Unattainable kind of a thing, is that it? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  You talk about it in your book here, there's a sexy gait, and I'm trying to find, which  is, I guess, a walk?  Yeah, swagger.  They did this study, and they basically found that women are attracted to a sexy swagger  in a guy, and men are attracted to a sway in the hips, and apparently, it's so important  that whether they show just the silhouette of a person, or the actual person, the swagger  is the first thing that women notice.  So, like, the way James Bond walks, that kind of swagger with shoulders and stuff.  Is the, um, now, I heard women like bow-legged guys, because it almost looks like you have  a bigger dick than you do. 
[02:54:30]  Like, it looks like your genitals.  That's a new one for me.  I've heard that they like bow-legged men because of that.  That research I have not found.  Really?  I don't have a sexy walk at all.  Because your dick is, like, banging in between your knees, so you have to, why would that?  It just looks like there's something, like, when I see, there's something very sexy I'll  see on a woman.  Like, when you're looking head-on to a woman, and you look, and she's wearing clothes, and  you can see, like, the front of her jeans, but when you can look between her legs and  see, like, the outline of her ass cheeks, it looks like her ass is, like, kind of,  there's something so fucking sexy about that. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, you notice details.  Oh, Jimmy's a detail guy.  I noticed that, yeah.  It's all about the details.  So this is what we're going to do.  We're going to take a break, and we're going to continue.  We got Adam.  He's one of our guys.  And what, you have a, according to the instructions in Dr. Z's book, Adam has made a list of 10  positive things about himself.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that he feels will help him in scoring a hot date.  Yeah, yeah.  So you'll look at his answers and see where he's at?  Absolutely.  Okay.  And we'll see what kind of prototype he fits in, if he's the rescuer, the defender, the entertainer. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  We also had him.  Oh, wow.  She's fucking good.  We also had him write a paragraph describing his perfect mate, so we got that.  Okay, cool.  And we also have, I guess there's another exercise where you have guys circle words or something?  Yeah, well, it's a word, yeah, to see.  And there's also exercise, so what exercise?  A confidence building exercise where you develop a rejection immunity state where you don't really  care if you get rejected.  Okay, very cool.  So he circled those words as well, or some of the words, and we'll see what that means  for Adam.  And by the way, I'd love to see what, are you married or are you a boyfriend? 
[02:56:00]  Well, we're in a relationship.  I would love to see what he looks like.  I guarantee you, he's either, he's a super mom.  He's very old and extremely wealthy, or he is fucking, or he has got washboard abs.  No, he's got major love handles.  Does he really?  I never, you know what, I'm not, I've never been into, into washboard abs.  Like, my sister's obsessed with fitness, and so she's like, she's like a belly dance  and karate, so she loves guys who are fit.  I'm not, you know, I work out occasionally, but I don't particularly care about that. 
[02:56:30]  Our own E-Roc has washing machine abs.  His washboard teeth.  He's scraping food over them.  But my, you know what, he does fit though my childhood prototype, because I had a crush  on my cousin who was half gypsy.  And the men I've always picked, like, had this sort of gypsy kind of look to them.  Like a blood cousin?  Well, he, yeah, he was, he was my mother's sister's, you know, illegitimate son. 
[02:57:00]  Illegitimate?  Yes, he was a bastard child, but she hooked up with this gypsy, and nobody really liked  him, and because he was kind of, like, wild and irreverent and crazy.  Thinner.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I died with a ton of my lips.  Those are the kind of guys I've always been attracted to.  See, that's why I talk about prototypes in my book.  There's a prototype for everyone.  They're a fucking gypsy?  Jesus.  I have gypsy.  I have gypsies here, do we?  No, I never, you know, never did. 
[02:57:30]  But my mom used to say that, you know, I don't remember it.  She reminded me, she's like, when you're five years old and a cousin will come visit,  but you'll only see him a couple times a year, you're always like, can I, mommy, can I sit  on his lap while we watch TV?  So apparently, this sort of prototype imprinting kind of love map thing goes back to very early  childhood.  Well, at five, too, the vodka probably hit you real hard, right?  And now how do you, you Soviets.  Actually, don't drink at all.  You Soviet people.  Don't drink at all.  I don't drink.  I'm a sea toddler.  I don't drink at all.  I'm a, you know, I'm a health fanatic. 
[02:58:00]  Wow, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, I don't, I take a lot of vitamins, and I do this program.  It's a, it's a rejuvenating program, surecell.com.  So no, I cannot drink.  It would be against my beliefs.  Yeah, we'll make up for that.  Don't you worry.  You like protein?  Whose companies won't go broke?  Yeah, protein's not bad, but although I'm mostly, mostly vegetarian.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Do you have bad gas?  Vegetarian farts are the worst.  No, I don't know.  My friend Dodd's a vegetarian.  His fucking farts are award-winning. 
[02:58:30]  That's what Beano's for.  What's that?  That's the stuff you take.  A little pill.  Yeah, it's a good pill.  No, I'm going to take Beano.  I need to, because I'm going to take some Metamucil, and I'm actually flying with my  girlfriend across the country.  I didn't take Metamucil last night.  Oh, no.  Because my gas, it's so.  It's death flight for her.  If I was just me and my stupid, and Kenny, I would have drank more.  Jimmy?  But with your, what?  The oxygen masks are going to drop down from the plane, which is what I do.  I got a question for Jimmy, though.  You're flying with your girlfriend, right?  Yeah.  On Valentine's Day, which is very romantic. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, it's a holiday.  It's beautiful, right?  But if Victoria decided that she wanted to get with you, what would happen to the girlfriend?  Mid-flight, I'd open the emergency door and plant my shoe in her spine.  And I'd say, close your eyes.  I have a special gift for you.  And her little hands would be all crinkled, and she'd hear the whoosh of wind as she got  sucked out into the vortex.  There you go.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Look at that cloud you're falling through.  Oh, see, you guys are so shallow. 
[02:59:30]  We women are so much deeper than that.  How about another scenario?  She'd be deep in the ground when she hit.  Another scenario that I picture, she's got the flowers and the candy that you got her.  You'd be like, give me that back.  No, I wouldn't.  I would just say, oh, you're interested here, honey.  Take these flowers.  Now cross your hands.  Let me put these flowers on your chest.  God bless.  It's been real.  It's been nice.  But it hasn't been real nice.  Oh, would you wreck your life over this one?  Without a doubt. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  And my family's life.  If she wished it.  Only if she wished it.  You would say just fuck it to everything, right, Jimmy?  I would end the relationship however she saw it.  I would like her to be set on fire.  You know what?  Damn good point.  That's right.  See, in my book, I talk about how you have to show kindness and magnanimity to turn women  on.  And so far, I don't see the display of kindness.  You're not seeing that in him, are you?  No, no.  She may say, keep it painless.  Or I would take her for a boat ride like Fredo at the end of The Godfather 2. 
[03:00:30]  She'd say a Hail Mary.  She'd never see it coming.  Or I would just never talk to her again.  I'd be gentle about it.  I would just never call her back.  And she wants to matter.  I would click.  I would be very nice.  That's his version of being nice.  I would say, love you.  Click.  So we're going to take a break.  We got Dr. Z.  Her book's called Dr. Z.  Dr. Z's?  What?  No.  How to Pick Up, Seduce, and Hook Up with Hot Women.  And if you take off another piece of clothing, we'll plug a website. 
[03:01:00]  Your website.  What the hell do you think she is?  She's standing up.  She's getting ready to do it.  Unless she's very comfortable.  There's got to be one.  All right.  Maybe I'll flash some boobies.  Yes.  Flash some boobies.  Make the flash of some boobies.  Without taking stuff off.  It's too much trouble.  All right.  A flash of the boobie would be nice for Valentine's Day.  Sure would be.  Just for you guys.  A very special movie flashing present.  All right.  You ready?  Yes.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  The bra's still on.  Excuse me.  Hey, hey. 
[03:01:30]  Slow down, Hopi.  Jesus Christ.  She's got a flash on the subway.  That's the problem.  Eager ass.  And I talk about it in my book.  Guys are too eager.  I know.  The book.  The book.  The book.  The book.  The book.  Slow down.  Slow down.  That's good.  That's what happens.  The guy just, you know, you're going to like slowly, slowly.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I got it.  I almost said va-va-voom.  Va-va-voom?  How could you say va-va-voom?  They are. 
[03:02:00]  Are those real?  She has very.  They are mostly real.  Mostly real.  90% real.  She has very, very, very beautiful thick nipples.  This guy's on nipples again.  You're like a nipple.  Well, that's what you're showing me.  Believe me, if you were showing more, I'd be commenting on that.  But you're only showing me your breasts.  And she has a very large, sexy areola.  She's really sexy.  Thick nipples.  Yeah.  That's very sexy.  I have a fetish fat.  And I thought you said it was hot in here, if you know what I mean.  They're very, very, very...  I really, very rarely can I not say...  They're well-defined. 
[03:02:30]  Excellent.  Like, if you were wearing a white shirt, you'd be able to see...  You can see those nipples through a spacesuit.  They're beautiful.  They are.  They almost...  It's like writing a note.  Can you write a note to my nipples?  I almost feel like I'm looking at a piece of art or a poem.  A poem.  You know what?  I think...  You know what?  He's got a lot of artistic qualities.  I could see why he'd be popular with women.  I mean, he is just...  Oh, you're very perceptive.  You probably can write poetry, right?  You can write poetry?  I sure can.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Can I suck on them, please? 
[03:03:00]  You?  Yeah, I knew.  I knew there was talent somewhere there.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  I'll lick one if you want to lick two.  I'm very good.  I'm very gifted.  You are very good.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  We're going to take a break.  We got...  Thick nipples to me are very...  Let's just...  Before we move on.  They are just...  There's nothing...  I like thicker things like that.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Vaginal lips are very thick.  Yes, you like that?  Yeah.  She's fantastic.  He lets people know what he likes.  Yeah, that's good.  Very nice. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, you can't be shy about it.  I don't fuck around and beat around the bush with that stuff.  And actually, women love it when you give them tons of compliments and when you tell them  in descriptive detail what you're going to do to them.  You know?  That's a big turn on.  Because they say, like, men fall in love with their eyes.  Women fall in love with their ears.  So talk to them.  Tell them what you're going to do to them.  This one, you know, this one centerfold friend of mine, she was a runner-up in my year.  And she ended up marrying this guy.  And I wasn't really impressed.  I mean, there's nothing impressive about him.  And she said, oh, I loved him because he would tell me, like, in this detail, everything  he'd call me, everything he's going to do to me that night. 
[03:04:00]  And it would just get me so hot and horny I had to marry him.  What?  I can do the same for you right now.  What I'm going to do to you.  Oh, go ahead, Jim.  Follow, beg.  Follow, beg.  Follow, beg.  Jimmy, what would you do to her?  Seriously.  Let's try it off.  It would depend on our relationship.  I mean, it would depend on what she got off on, too.  See, it's not sexy to me to pull someone's hair if they don't like it.  It doesn't turn me on.  Do you like a little hair pulling?  Oh, I think all women like a little hair pulling.  I mean, see, I always say, I say you start out slow and sensuous. 
[03:04:30]  Once you get her to that arousal plateau, then you can get a little raw.  Then you start the choking.  I mean, you can get a little rougher depending on how she likes it.  Distracted by your Ricardo Montalban from Wrath of Conches.  There's a lot going on there.  Yeah, the nipples are really thick.  They're juicy.  They're really, really sexy.  I like to pull a woman's hair, but I like to, like a lot of guys want to wrap their hand 
[03:05:00]  by the head and pull because that way you don't really, but I like to grab like from  the very bottom at the very end of the hair and just yank really hard.  Make a retarded boy sound.  They like that.  Something smells good.  What's cooking in here?  Something does smell good.  What do you guys have to do?  It's probably your nipples.  They just smell like delicious cinnamon.  Cinnamon nipples.  We're going to take a break.  We'll continue with Dr. Z.  We got Adam who did some of the exercises in your book.  We got Ryan Starr who's going to do a couple songs.  Ryan, you want to see Boobies? 
[03:05:30]  How do I compete with this?  Great.  The good looking singer's coming in.  This is Ryan Starr.  He has good cheeks too.  Huh?  What is he doing?  We don't need your guitar.  He's just saying hi.  Hi.  How's it going?  Great.  Good morning.  How's it going?  You like her boobies?  I do.  I'd like to offer her a Valentine's Day gift.  Oh, wow.  I get gifts too.  Oh, I love it.  A brand new KY Heat.  Oh, very nice.  Thank you.  Wow.  Look at you.  Just happened to have that with you as a little gift. 
[03:06:00]  What's KY Heat?  Thank you very much.  It's great.  I sold out to Dwayne Reed down the street.  You're so done, Jimmy.  Great.  Wait.  No, hold on.  Valentine's Day.  It really warms up.  Do you read the post?  You know what?  I talk about something similar called Zestra, which does a very similar thing.  It's a plug competition.  Wait.  What's KY Heat?  Show them.  Show them.  Yeah.  It's a personal lubricant that warms up.  It has a warming action.  And there's a few of them on the market.  This one on the better ones.  Can you put some on Jimmy's nipples? 
[03:06:30]  I can do that.  I don't like.  Oh, you can check it out.  I don't like that, but I'll take whatever.  I don't like warming things.  Jimmy, are you allowed to have her just tweak your nipples?  No.  No, I can't.  I would love to, but I can't.  Gotta have respect.  I don't know.  Yeah, I can't.  On Valentine's Day, that's a kick-up death.  That's often what's freaky.  I can't do it.  And I wouldn't anyway, because I love her.  How much?  A lot.  You know, she's really a good important...  I'm glad I got here early.  This is what's been going on in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does this work, Ryan? 
[03:07:00]  You can just squeeze this out here.  I don't use stuff like this.  Oh, there you go.  No, it's actually very popular.  The warming lotions and lubes.  Very popular.  I'm rubbing it.  And I do...  It's funny.  I mentioned some of that in my book about the warming lotions.  Enough about the book!  Hey, I want to see it like number three on Amazon, then I'll stop talking.  I thought you were here just because you liked us.  I am starting to like you guys.  She's got business to conduct.  I particularly love that Russian accent impersonation.  Thank you.  It's very good.  I don't know why it's a W instead of a V. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  That always got me with Chekhov.  Another Star Trek reference.  Dope.  I'm really making points with my geeky sci-fi stuff, ain't I?  The Opie and El Nerdo show.  Hey, uh...  Is this a policy here?  Why am I Spanish?  El Nerdo?  I don't know.  Because Anthony has more syllables than nerd.  Yeah, I hear ya.  Hey, um...  Before we go to break,  I want to show Victoria what she would look like if you got, um...  Old?  Well, um... 
[03:08:00]  Let's just say if your body started melting.  How about this?  Victoria, if she went through a black hole.  Alright, thank you.  Yes, bring her in.  This is Sandy Kane.  This proves that...  She's an old burlesque dancer.  Yeah, this proves that God has a sense of humor.  And this is why you should thank your lucky stars.  You got an education.  And, um...  You are now an educated woman with degrees.  Because she's still doing this. 
[03:08:30]  What do you...  What do you...  Sandy.  Sandy, what do you think of her breasts?  Beautiful.  Yeah.  I think she looks hot.  Yeah, thank you.  You like Sandy?  In the dark.  In the dark.  Drink a six-pack, smoke some crack.  Um...  Here she goes with the same show.  Hey, can I do my plugs now?  Because I never can do my plugs.  I'm going to be in Cleveland, which is a big comedy town.  Oh, really?  Because I heard you guys talking about Cleveland at a place called Now That's Class. 
[03:09:00]  Way to contribute to the bitch.  I love Ohio.  You know why?  That's good.  Why?  It's just a nice place.  It is?  Okay.  You should stay there.  Well, they're paying me.  Right.  I should stay there.  I'm going to promote it.  But it's cool.  Now That's Class.  And, um...  In fact, the guy loved my song, Tits My Party, which I wanted to do.  It's Tits My Party, but she says Tits instead of It's.  Tits My Party.  It's fascinating.  Right.  And I'll be in Cleveland March 7th and 8th, Friday and Saturday. 
[03:09:30]  And I'll also be tomorrow night at the Broadway Comedy Club at 10 o'clock on Jeff Cole's show.  So, hallelujah.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Great.  Are you getting another PD job anywhere?  A PG?  Oh, fuck.  I'm sorry.  What's PG mean?  I got confused.  I'm sorry.  Nothing.  Never mind.  I just...  I was confused.  But, uh...  Oh, good.  So, you got...  Yes.  Are those implants or gorgeous?  Oh, well, they're slightly enhanced.  Slightly?  What does slightly mean?  It means from just a half size up.  Just for the perkiness effect rather than the volume. 
[03:10:00]  Did you have a before picture?  Yeah.  Actually, I was a playboy centerfold in October 94.  I was all natural.  But then afterwards, they just started to get a little bit, you know, a little bit...  You were centerfold 13 years ago?  I was a October 94 playmate and 2004 penthouse bed of the year.  Wow.  So, I was one of the few...  Actually, one of the few things that Guccione and Hefner ever agreed upon.  You're like, uh...  Yeah.  Doing, uh...  Leno and Letterman.  This surgery's great.  It's like Jimmy.  I wish I could put a new head on me. 
[03:10:30]  Well, these are by Dr. Giampappa.  He's a Montclair.  I volunteer to take the old one off.  Take the old one off.  Elvar Cowie style.  What are you going to do with it besides protect crops?  I wish someone could do my face like her tits are done.  Throw it in the ocean to kill the Kraken.  I'm just saying, hey, but it, you know, works.  She's got great face.  She just needs slight tweaking.  She needs to go to Dr. Giampappa and...  Leave his name for me, really. 
[03:11:00]  You know, and then we'll do a before, show, and then after.  And I'll come back.  Watch.  He's actually a number one anti-aging...  The only anti-aging plastic surgeon.  He does a whole approach where he'll take your DNA and then he'll customize your nutrition  program and creams, age-reversing creams.  He's a founder of American Anti-Agent Society.  Or in your case, carbon.  I don't get it.  It's a carbon dating job.  It's a carbon dating job.  Okay, I don't get it.  But anyway, do you like my skirt?  Take your DNA and make Jurassic Park. 
[03:11:30]  I did Twaddle, man, for Valentine's Day.  Oh.  I did Twaddle.  Oh, that's very nice.  Could you show the doc and completely wreck the mood?  That's it.  Hey, you know.  We're just so self-destructive.  We're on a nice path.  You are gorgeous.  She is gorgeous.  If I was a lesbian, I would eat out with her.  Yeah.  What's that?  If I was a lesbian...  I heard you.  I would eat out.  I heard you.  Why are you wearing a silly little hat on your head?  That is the littlest silly looking hat. 
[03:12:00]  It says O&A.  All the way with O&A on it.  Yeah.  Jimmy goes, she looks like Jean Benet now.  She's dressed like a little cowgirl, but...  Anyway, this is my creation for Valentine's Day for O&A and Jim and...  Everything but the Garrett around your neck.  The best part.  I have a new slogan.  I think it's very cute and creative.  You like that?  I mean, look at that.  I like your faces.  I mean, she went on a bit.  Display a little gratitude, guys. 
[03:12:30]  A little kindness.  We should.  Magnanimity.  This is as nice as you've ever been.  This is generous.  Yeah.  No, but do you like the faces?  I do.  I got Jimmy in my pussy.  Oh, good.  Not really.  Wait, you got our faces on your boobs?  Yeah.  On your bra?  Oh, wonderful.  That's nice.  In hearts.  All right, show the doctor what you got going on.  We nicknamed this years ago Twato.  Yeah, this is...  I did it in a heart because it really is a heart.  Get closer.  Dildo likes her.  Yeah, I know.  That's her black dildo.  Don't jump on her. 
[03:13:00]  That's her dildo.  Oh, right.  Oh, nice to dance for 50 girls.  So cute.  And he's a bisexual.  You got to buy him something.  All right, here we go.  This is Twato, and I did it for Valentine's Day.  Oh.  It is.  Interesting.  That's interesting.  That's a little heart?  Yeah, it is.  It's a little heart.  I never knew it was a heart until Opie and Anthony's show, and they just really taught  me that, so I just did it for Valentine's Day.  What do you think of that, Doc?  Besides a frog to be perched on a...  I mean, it's interesting. 
[03:13:30]  What do you think it is?  I know you're not a doctor in that way, but you're a girl.  What do you think?  You know a little something about what you should have down there.  That's growing out of her.  What do you mean?  Oh, you think that's something she put on her body?  That's attached to her body.  She just painted it.  Oh, I see what you mean.  You mean it's like a...  Get a flashlight.  It's a...  It's some kind of...  Like a mole?  Yeah, keep it there.  Yeah, something like that.  A mole or...  That happens.  Or general herpes.  General herpes, but I'm still alive.  Move the skirt. 
[03:14:00]  It looks like...  It looks like a mole.  A mole?  This is a word, isn't it?  I know you Russians know a thing or two about moles, but this is a little bigger than  a mole.  I can't tell, because it's pink.  Take the heart off it, Tammy.  Many women in the Soviet Union look like that from Chernobyl.  Show her inside.  When Chernobyl explodes, many women get the twatel.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's like a skin tag.  That's what it is.  That's happened.  Skin tag.  Yeah.  See.  I'm not a dermatologist, but it looks like a skin tag. 
[03:14:30]  This woman is more than a pretty face, you know?  I mean, really.  Because they had doctors in.  All right.  You think it's a skin tag?  Why don't you touch it?  Doc?  I can touch it.  I don't want you to touch it.  No, no, no.  I don't want you to touch it.  Doc doesn't care.  Doc rules.  How do you know?  We need a woman president.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Thank you, man.  It's just a skin tag.  I mean, you know, you see them sometimes, like, you know, on the neck a lot.  The guys will have it on the neck.  Fat guys, usually.  Yeah.  It's a skin tag.  I think I got it.  I was shaving my pussy years ago, and all of a sudden it was there. 
[03:15:00]  Do you think I can get that from shaving?  That or with a clamshell back in the old days, maybe.  I don't know, but I mean, maybe.  One day it was there.  I don't really know where.  I was not born with it.  I just want you to know.  But Twato loves Opie and Anthony, and that's why Twato does.  Thank you.  That's very cute.  I have a lot of feelings.  I don't know how you get that close, Jimmy.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to bring in Adam, who's 22 years old, Dr. Z.  Jesus. 
[03:15:30]  Okay.  And he's never kissed a girl before.  Okay.  He's got something going on.  We don't know what it is yet.  All right, let's talk to him.  He was the one that did your exercises in the book, so it should be interesting.  We got Ryan Starr.  We got Sandy Cain, the wonderful Sandy Cain.  Great, thank you.  I'm putting my boobs back in, so this is your last chance to admire the thick and very protruding nipples.  So take the last look.  Do you want to take a picture together?  You are gorgeous.  All right, stand up.  This is the camera.  And she's nice and brilliant, too. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, she's brilliant.  Jimmy, man, you should go for her.  I don't want to take the picture, Sandy, because it's...  Why do you have wet?  What happened?  Did you spill water?  I spilled water on you.  So you got wet from you, Jim.  Let's...  It's all the poetry I turned on.  And she knows how to smile, too.  She certainly does.  We're going to take a break.  She is a gorgeous woman.  You have good taste.  I really wish you were still doing therapy.  She's actually good.  Wait, who has good taste?  You guys have great taste.  They have a gorgeous hunk.  Like we...  Right.  Like we had some...  You know what? 
[03:16:30]  We got to talk about Jane Fonda.  It is real.  Hold on a minute.  I think we got it here.  Yeah.  Supposedly Jane Fonda said the C word on TV.  You know, the big C bomb that women don't really like to hear a lot.  It's a word I try not to say that much.  I'm just going to say it because it was the...  You're a cunt.  Yeah.  They don't like that.  She couldn't have said that on TV.  Well, let's see.  Here it is.  Let's hear.  Amazing.  And I know when it started, there were some A-list celebrities who came out to help you.  But Jane, you at first were not a big fan of the play. 
[03:17:00]  So what turned you around?  Well, it wasn't that I wasn't a big fan.  I hadn't seen the play.  I live in Georgia, okay?  I was asked to do a monologue called Cunt.  And I said, I don't think so.  I got enough problems.  But then you were invited to go see it.  Oh, wow.  Whoa.  What?  And we get fired?  How about this?  What?  That was on the Today Show.  Yeah.  How about this?  They have to get an FCC fine for that. 
[03:17:30]  They have to.  People complain.  How do they not get an FCC fine?  And they laughed nervously after it.  They made believe they didn't hear it.  Amazing.  And I know when it started, there were some A-list celebrities who came out to help you.  But, Jane, you at first were not a big fan of the play.  So what turned you around?  Well, it wasn't that I wasn't a big fan.  I hadn't seen the play.  I live in Georgia, okay?  I was asked to do a monologue called Cunt.  And I said, I don't think so.  I got enough problems. 
[03:18:00]  But then you were invited to go see it.  Everyone should get fired.  She was talking about the vagina monologue.  Fire everyone!  She goes, I did a monologue called Cunt instead of, you know, vagina monologue.  So she was saying that.  And wow, you're not allowed to say that on broadcast.  That is the ultimate dirty word.  She said it right there on television.  That's worse than fuck, I think, on TV.  Wow.  Check Drudge Reports.  He was up there.  We had some tasteless remarks made on this show, which is Uncensored Satellite.  Let's just see if it's on Drudge.  Yeah, what about Breitbart?  Andrew Breitbart.  All right, we're going to take a break and regroup here and do some more radio for everybody. 
[03:18:30]  We got Ryan Starr.  We got Dr. Z.  We got Sandy Kane.  Yeah, I see my face on your bra.  You doing any signings, Doc?  Yeah, if you go to drzeonscoring.com, it has, you know, my webmaster updates with various signings and sightings and all that stuff.  All right, we'll be back in just a bit.  Hi, I like to listen to Opie and Anthony when I'm feeling blue, just like the pills Uncle Henry gives me before bed. 
[03:19:00]  They make me feel all tingly down there, and my undies get tight.  Then Uncle Henry stares at me with a stopwatch.  Opie and Anthony!  I wish I could sleep on my tummy.  We got another busy show here on XM Satellite Radio.  We got the good doctor in studio, Dr. Victoria. 
[03:19:30]  Just, yeah, say it the way it's spelled.  Dr. Z on Scoring is the name of the book.  Drzeonscoring.com, sex advice.  We got Ryan Starr.  He's over there with his guitar.  We got Sandy Cain just sitting there making everyone uncomfortable.  He's snapping pictures.  I like taking pictures.  Poor Pat Duffy is trying to set up for Ryan Starr, and Sandy Cain is leaning in, getting like two feet from his face, and just taking pictures of Pat Duffy.  How uncomfortable was that, Pat? 
[03:20:00]  Just randomly blinding me out of nowhere.  I didn't expect it.  Shut up.  It's like one of those flashbangs, go up and call a duty.  I can't see.  Yeah.  I can't see, God damn it.  And this is Adam, Dr. Z.  Hello.  Nice to meet you, Adam.  Nice to meet you.  Adam's a little odd.  He's one of our interns here.  He's one of our young interns.  And he's very socially awkward.  He has not had sex. 
[03:20:30]  He is how old?  22.  He's 22 years old.  He's cute.  Hasn't had a girlfriend.  I think he kissed once.  No.  I can tell he's shy, because he's avoiding eye contact.  Yeah.  He's like lowering his eyes.  Very shy.  But he seems like the kind of guy that's not just shy, like in a kind of cute, shy way.  He's shy in the, I'm going to hack you apart with a meat cleaver way.  He's very, there's something very creepy about him.  I don't see that.  I just see him kind of reserved and taciturn. 
[03:21:00]  I don't see him particularly creepy.  Reserved in what?  Tassiturn.  What's that mean?  Just kind of quiet, like, you know.  She had to learn this language, and she knows words you don't.  Don't say you like you guys understood what taciturn means.  How about let's rephrase that?  I do now, so you can't catch me when it is to me.  She says words that we don't know.  So, you've gone through my book, and what do you think about it?  Well, I didn't go through your book. 
[03:21:30]  What?  Why not?  Was I supposed to read it?  Look through it, yeah.  Look through it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I looked through it, and I thought there were some interesting parts that I could use, and  I was absorbing the information like a sponge, because I direly need that information.  Well, I could tell her, you know, the way you talk, it sounds very monotonous, like the  voice.  You need to enunciate more.  Really?  You need to be a little more animated, because like right now, the personalities, you come  across very dull. 
[03:22:00]  Right.  First thing I work on is just a little more animation in the voice, a little more energy.  Are you saying the Manchurian candidate thing isn't working for you?  It's just a bit, and also smile more, like you don't smile a whole lot.  More, also more, like the body language, like the shoulders are kind of stooped.  No, he's like, relax your shoulders.  Yeah, yeah, or something.  You're putting something with them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, relax your shoulders, chest back, smile.  Look at him straining to relax. 
[03:22:30]  And, I mean, you know what it is?  It's all these techniques, it takes time and practice.  It's not like one of those magical makeovers, but I think he's got a lot of potential.  I mean, he's very nice looking.  Would you touch his penis?  You can't.  What?  What happened?  What?  But tell me about that.  So, do you go out?  Do you meet women?  Or do you just, what is the reason you are not with anybody?  Well, I don't really go out too much. 
[03:23:00]  Nine times out of ten.  I'm at home.  In front of the computer?  No, either reading or doing research.  Research?  On like...  What research are you doing here?  Like, I got some freelance writings I'm working on, and I just stay home and do some...  Man's writings?  So, you're not really comfortable going to clubs and so forth?  No, I'll make the...  Like, at college, when my roommates would throw a party, you know, I'd make the occasional appearance.  And then what would happen?  And then I'd just, like, leave and go to the shoe pool. 
[03:23:30]  So, what happens when you start talking to a woman?  You know, do you get uncomfortable?  I get uncomfortable.  It's everything.  Like, I don't even know how to...  Like, I want to say that...  I want to say that fate...  Like, I'll find the right one.  Like, the universe is going to, like...  You know, going to come together, and I'm going to find that perfect girl.  Well, you know, first of all, before you find the perfect one, you just have to find some girl. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, it's a numbers game, you know?  I mean, you got to meet, like...  You got to meet, say, 20 women to like one, you know, for her to like you.  So, if you don't meet any, how are you going to meet the perfect one?  You got to go out and meet them.  And, you know, in your situation, I would say, it's a matter of just social skills and just going out and starting talking to people.  Like, talk to people on the street.  Talk to people in the cleaners.  Everywhere you go, start talking to them randomly about stuff so you're just comfortable approaching and talking to people.  I was at Starbucks recently, and there was a girl in front of me. 
[03:24:30]  I thought that was a humorous anecdote.  And she had a big bag, and she had various...  Wow, is she tranny?  She had a big bag, and she had a bunch of little bags, and I just said,  Hey, it looks like you have a series of bags in your bag.  So, what did she say?  And she just stared at me really weird.  Well, that doesn't make sense.  How could she not? 
[03:25:00]  What does that mean?  That well-said flirt.  It looks like you have a series of bags in your bag?  Yeah.  What was that?  Wait, wait.  Were you trying to be funny?  No, I was just trying to create conversation.  Conversation?  I don't even know.  I don't even, like...  It just kind of was an awkward sentence, I would say.  Wow, that is really awkward.  It's just under your eyes.  That probably would have been much smoother.  Yeah.  You look really tired.  You'd have gotten a reaction.  Yes.  We got him to write the ten positive things about himself.  Okay.  It's one of the things in your book, right?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:25:30]  One of the beginnings.  All right.  Well, here we go.  This is just great.  Adam enjoys running in 5Ks and 10Ks.  Three years ago, I ran a half marathon.  This summer, I'll be training to run the entire 26.2-mile track.  Oh.  Also known as a fucking marathon.  Two, I'm addicted to attending weekly yoga and Pilates classes.  Well, that's a good thing.  That's a perfect place to meet women.  I mean, you don't meet women at yoga, Pilates?  That's a school of women.  Well, because of my schedule here, I normally go on the afternoon, like the noonish classes. 
[03:26:00]  And so they're all like middle-aged women.  And they're really not my age.  Pick one of them off.  Yeah.  Kick a MILF.  Does he masturbate?  Hold on.  The voice of doom back there.  Masturbate.  I mean, what do you do when your dick gets, you know, like horny and stuff?  I talk to him.  He seems pretty horny to me.  Wait, bring Sandy closer.  She could definitely answer this.  No, I didn't mean that.  Because, you know, I worked in peep shows and stuff. 
[03:26:30]  I worked in peep shows.  And all kinds of men used to come in and masturbate because maybe someone like you that really doesn't have a girlfriend.  But your dick gets hot and you want to see someone like her or me.  And, you know, and you masturbate.  You masturbate.  The truth.  Do I masturbate?  Well, everybody masturbates to an extent.  But the thing is, sometimes I think too much masturbating is not always good.  Because you know what happens?  Men develop what we call autoerotic orientation, which means they almost like it in the cycle where they, you know, fantasy masturbation. 
[03:27:00]  And then they don't feel driven to go out and meet women anymore.  It's like autoerotic orientation.  And so a little masturbation is good.  But you also seem like your kind of person.  You're talking about the ideal woman.  You want to have a companion.  So you have to make an effort to go out and meet people.  They're not going to, you know, miss rights.  They're not going to knock on your door and all of a sudden say, here I am, you know.  So if the noon class doesn't work, then you've got to change it to other times, other places. 
[03:27:30]  You've got to think.  You like athletic women, it seems like.  So maybe change the gym.  Go change the yoga class to a time where there is women.  I mean, that's a good place to meet women.  Does he masturbate?  Did he answer your sanity?  Yes, he said that he does masturbate.  How often?  And yeah, what do you think of?  Yeah, who do you think of?  Like a fantasy woman and it'll be her next time?  I just load up a various porno flick and I just go at it, you know. 
[03:28:00]  Uh-huh, go at it?  Put the love rod into the ignition.  Right hand or left?  The love rod into the ignition.  Allie.  No, what?  She's like every evening at the improv comic.  Yeah.  No, it's my right hand.  I call it Miss Michigan.  I go out with her.  Boo.  Boo.  Are you trying to do jokes?  See the voice again?  I don't even know.  Is he trying to do jokes?  Guys, you've got to work on this voice.  And I have a whole chapter on voice.  They found, there's a study that found that guys...  I bet you it's in the book.  We'll have, yes. 
[03:28:30]  It's in the book.  We'll have lower voices.  Actually have more wife's girlfriends and they have more children.  So there's something about a low, confident voice.  Right.  So we've got to...  He's mumbling.  I completely agree.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got to project.  Okay, let's project.  Let's put some confidence in animation.  It's also a huge cock, by the way.  That's what the deep voice...  That's right.  Hey.  What?  That has something to do...  What is that telling a woman psychologically when you have a deep voice?  It's got something to do with your potency? 
[03:29:00]  It's testosterone, yes.  Because it's one of the signifiers for testosterone, which is women subconsciously look for.  But you can...  There's something you can work on, like enunciation, projection, the voice.  Let's hear a deep voice from you, Adam.  Well, hello.  How are you doing today?  My name's Adam.  She's laughing at you.  She's trying...  No, I'm not laughing.  I'm just smiling in a very welcoming way.  Hello.  My name's Adam.  How are you doing?  I think he's doing better.  I mean, I'm hearing some rejection.  Yeah, he's doing John Wayne.  What are you doing?  But you're also adding some weird accent to that. 
[03:29:30]  I don't know about the accent, but...  That's coming from, you know, a Soviet.  Hey, my accent I can't do anything about.  It's endearing.  Don't worry about it.  I would just go, hey, nice to meet you.  What's happening?  What's up?  What's your story?  Where are you from?  Yeah, that's good.  It's all good.  All good lines.  What's your story?  But do you follow up with it?  Yeah, that's a popular sort of young folk.  That's what they say.  What's your story?  This is his answer.  What's your story?  If you want to ask him about any of that other stuff.  Who is he?  A cop though?  Walking the beach?  You want some shoe leather? 
[03:30:00]  What's your story?  Tell your story walking.  Don't you think that he's doing great just being on Opie and Anthony and working for...  And having beautiful women?  Shut up!  Why?  I think he just needs to go out there and practice approaching and talking to women.  And then, you know, the other thing is, it seems like, you know, a lot of guys like him,  because he's kind of shy, kind of reserved, they'll open a conversation and then I bet  you kind of get stuck.  You don't know what to say next a lot of times.  So I tell guys to look for buzzwords, award hooks to continue the conversation. 
[03:30:30]  So for instance, if you say, okay, how do you like this place?  And she says, it's okay, it's kind of crowded.  Then crowded's your buzzword.  Then you use that to continue the conversation.  You'll say, yeah, I don't like particularly careful crowds either.  You know, are there any other places you like around here?  You know what I mean?  So you've got to look for these words on which you can hang, the conversation has to flow  naturally.  Okay, wait a minute now.  So a good buzzword, if she said, get the fuck away from me, you could say, fucking, I like  him.  He's a quick learner.  I like him.  He's a good student, quick learner. 
[03:31:00]  Anything else in the positive things there?  Let's see, let's see what he has.  So he plays, baseball plays a huge role in my life.  You know, I don't know, the baseball is a tough one.  I mean, I don't see how you could use that to pick up women very much.  You're trying with a niche.  A bunch of women there that might be into baseball.  Yeah, maybe.  But yoga and Pilates is great.  That's like the fool of good women, you know, hot women.  It's just a matter of changing the time.  Let's see.  Newspapers and crosswords are one of my favorite things to indulge in.  Well, you know what?  That's actually a good one. 
[03:31:30]  I always say if you carry like a crossword, like a newspaper with you and say you're in  a Starbucks and you're like sitting at a table and there's a girl next to you, you  could actually pick the easiest word there and then you can turn around to her and say,  listen, do you know the meaning of this?  Four letter word for woman starts with C.  But it's a good word.  It's actually a good conversation opener because you're not trying to pick her up.  The Pope wrote Cod.  You're just commenting on something in newspapers.  So you could be flipping through a newspaper and then say, oh, Britney Spears is at it again. 
[03:32:00]  And then you could turn to her and say, listen, what do you think of her?  Can you explain this?  Like ask her opinion.  And asking a woman opinion is a great way to approach her.  Could you actually say like, I'm stuck on this word.  What do you think it is?  And she's like, I don't know.  And then you go, you fucking retard.  Roll up the paper and hit her in the nose with it.  Thanks for nothing.  I needed you.  All right.  What else is on that?  Okay.  I'll occasionally go out to parties at bars.  I'll be in my room reading or doing research. 
[03:32:30]  Do you ever date online?  Do you do any online dating?  Anything online there, Adam?  By doing research, you mean torturing animals.  I'm doing my research.  You're cool.  You know, I've put a couple of dating profiles up on the internet over the years.  Oh, you have, have you?  I have.  How'd that work out for you?  Oh, it didn't.  Not good.  See, I don't see like a whole enthusiasm to me.  He's kind of like comfortable and you're comfortable in your routine.  If you like tedium and being bored shitless, date me, Adam. 
[03:33:00]  Singing karaoke.  Oh, that's cool.  Singing karaoke.  Hold on.  Doc, he likes to lie a lot.  Iraq, he's lying.  Yeah, he's lying about the online dating.  Why?  He tends to leave his Gmail open on people's computers.  Ah.  So.  Oh, no.  Pat has seen it.  I've seen it.  He trolls Craigslist for some girls.  Posts, responds to some of their posts.  Here comes Danny running in with some paperwork.  He has an online dating service through his college, too. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, boy.  Okay, so he's making some efforts.  Well, what have we got here?  What do you got, Danny?  A little bit of paperwork.  Danny's got something.  Danny says, I'm in good shape.  Last year, I was about 30 pounds overweight.  I lost it through running, bilatis, exercise, and a diet.  All right, there.  All right, there, sweetie pie.  Hold on for a second.  Hold on one second.  We can ask Dr. Z to hold one second.  He was 30 pounds heavier last year?  Who gives a shit?  We're going to throw one of the bus right here.  Now he's 30 pounds.  He's going to go squarely under a bus.  Yeah, yeah.  He's also going to have flat abs after the bus is done with him.  So wait.  Danny, what did you find? 
[03:34:00]  Oh.  Well, this was actually found by E-Rock, but I'm holding it physically here.  This is a Gmail message that he got from a girl named Jessica, and this is from something  called All MSU Dating.  What is that all about?  It's a college dating website affiliated through Michigan State University.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  What'd the letter say?  Well, it's not from him.  It's to him.  Right.  Oh. 
[03:34:30]  It says, hey, Adam, my name is Jessica.  I'm a sophomore.  I'm majoring in zoology, psychology, pre-vet medicine, blah, blah, blah.  I thought your profile looked interesting, so I decided to reply smiley face.  I was curious about what you were thinking of doing after you graduate MSU with your journalism  major.  My friend is actually contemplating English journalism.  It's just a bore fest of the letter here.  It's nice to see that there are people who enjoy the finer things in life along with spending  time to enjoy deep thinking. 
[03:35:00]  What?  Adam?  The finer things in life and deep thinking?  It seems like a lot of people in the United States especially are all about being rushed  and do not ever stop to smell the roses, to be a bit cliche.  Anyway, feel free to look at my profile if you'd like.  Oh, and I agree with you about how illogical this whole dating profile thing is.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  So you put the dating profile up, but you're like, I'm a deep thinker.  This is illogical.  This is not for me.  I was like, oh.  Spock, what do you think about that?  Did you write this nerd back?  Well, the thing is, though, he's trying to come across with an intellectual prototype, 
[03:35:30]  which will appeal to some women.  I mean, there are women out there who love nerds.  And I would think that the whole intellectual nerdy prototype will be very appealing to some  women.  I can see this girl's digging it.  What did this hippo have to say?  Yeah.  This fucking bespectacled mountain.  I don't know.  I just, I don't really remember.  Dear Cloverfield. 
[03:36:00]  I got you a chocolate stained letter.  Fucking have a drink of gravy and shoot yourself in a fucking harpoon.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Back to the dark.  What else is in there?  Okay.  So we got here.  I'm socially awkward in a good way.  He's not as bad as some guys have encountered.  I mean, he's got more hope than, I mean, there's some, I've, you know, over the years,  I've met some guys who literally shake and then can't even talk in front of a woman that 
[03:36:30]  have come a long way.  So he's pretty good.  I mean, he smiles.  He can talk.  He doesn't stutter.  Big A.  We should have had Big A.  So let's see.  My 88-year-old grandma thinks I'm a dreamboat.  The fuck I'm a dreamboat?  Why are you having sex with your grandma?  No, no, she, you're a dreamboat.  What are you doing?  My word.  No, she, she always, what happened? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, he's got baby powder around his mouth.  They powder everything, those old broads.  I mean, it's sweet.  It's not sweet.  It's sour.  But the one thing, I'm just hoping he doesn't mention it on dates because, you know, mentioning  family, like mom, grandma, it's not something you mentioned.  Creepy.  At the beginning.  No, what the thing is, I'm trying to allude to, is that family is important to me.  And my grandma, she has Alzheimer's and I go visit her. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, nice.  She forgets.  Yeah, she calls me a dreamboat, then she calls me a steamboat, and then Queen Mary.  And then a rowboat, and the love boat.  Yeah.  So it's, you know.  She just calls him various vessels.  Yeah.  Oh, you're such a, you're such a trailer hitch.  But he's trying to say he's got substance.  He's close to his family of origin.  Although something like this just could show that you're not differentiated enough from 
[03:38:00]  your family and come across as infantile and immature.  So I wouldn't mention stuff like that on a date.  Don't bring up a walnut brain on a date.  Not on a first date.  You could say.  I would have.  I'd recommend the guests bringing out family of origin early in the dating.  Hey, listen, I gotta, I gotta break in here.  Adam.  No.  Adam, so you've talked to this Jessica a few times, right?  Who?  Um, I guess. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, fuck.  Um, hold on, hold on.  I got an email that Adam wrote to this Jessica girl.  Ready?  Yeah.  Uh, I also shook Sly Stallone's hand when he came into the studio to promote Rambo.  What?  What?  It was a phoner.  That was.  Would you shake the phone while he was talking?  You're a liar?  I tried, I tried to pump myself up.  And, uh.  You did, huh? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we had Sly Stallone on the phone.  Yeah.  That's great.  And then you said you shook his hand.  You didn't even lie and say, like, we hung out and had a conversation.  See, he lies a lot.  So we don't know who the real Adam is.  We think he's a compulsive liar.  Yeah.  Of course he is.  I got shook Sly Stallone's hand.  Oh, no.  I think, you know, I think he's got, like, some self-esteem issues.  He's got to work on some, yeah, some self-esteem and start feeling good about himself without  the need to embellish things or confabulate things, you know, to bring yourself up.  I think you've got enough. 
[03:39:30]  Confabulate.  No.  Dr. Voss.  I punched Adrian in the stomach and she fell into a bag of feet.  He's got enough good quality.  Look at all the great qualities he's got.  Let's read.  He's agreeable, artistic, clean, dependable, enthusiastic, flexible, friendly, good-natured,  interesting, loyal, optimistic, peaceful, reasonable, sensitive, sexy, tender, and warm. 
[03:40:00]  So, obviously, there's enough qualities you can build on here to feel great about yourself.  You don't need to mask, you know, low self-esteem with this, you know, confabulation.  Yeah.  All these Sly Stallone things you could have done.  That's a little, like, weird that you would say that you shook Stallone's hand.  I had a turkey that Pauly threw through the window on Christmas.  Burt Young drank and punched me in the balls when he came in to promote Rocky.  I plucked the hair off of Dolph Lundgren's scrotum when he was promoting the run. 
[03:40:30]  Wow.  Why would you say that to pump yourself up?  I don't know.  Because there's really nothing to, like, I'm just flat.  It's not exciting.  You can't make it sound exciting enough that you work kind of behind the scenes at a radio  show like this without having to embellish by saying that you're meeting people that  never came in.  And, I mean, you can talk about just the daily events of a radio show. 
[03:41:00]  That's kind of something people don't deal with on a daily basis.  And one more email before we move on, because we've got Ryan Starr standing by.  The internship at O&A is having its ups and downs.  Last week, the talent, and you put talent in quotations.  This is why I hate you, by the way.  Holy shit!  I don't like you whatsoever.  I have no problem saying it to yourself.  All right.  Let me see that.  I have no problem saying it to your face, too.  Let me see the quotation.  It's no shock jock bit, by the way. 
[03:41:30]  It says, last week the talent, which is in quotation, spent three consecutive days ripping  me apart on air for an average of 30 minutes on each occasion.  I have no problem with that.  I have thick skin.  I've had worse things happen in life.  But the whole shock jock thing to me is a farce.  Oh, boy.  Shock jock in quotation.  That was...  Fuck a list.  That was a personal email to one of my professors, who really changed my life. 
[03:42:00]  You're evading the point here, which is talent and the shock jock thing.  Guys, you're taking it a little bit.  You're being too sensitive.  Oh, I don't think so.  You're being a little bit.  Oh, no.  You're taking it very personally.  Blessed to be here.  What?  He's very blessed to be here.  Shut the...  Okay.  That's my opinion.  No.  That's your opinion.  A little bit of an intellectual snob.  Opinions are like assholes full of your hemorrhoids. 
[03:42:30]  So, what do you mean by that, Adam?  Yeah, what do you mean?  We're shock jocks.  Explain.  That's what we're our...  And quote, unquote, talent.  No, I just...  I was talking to my professor.  We always send emails.  And, you know, he was from New York.  And he went to NYU.  And you send derogatory emails about us to him.  No, we...  Well, that's a little...  I just...  I was just telling it like it was.  Like it was.  But you don't agree that that's a little derogatory toward the show and the talent on 
[03:43:00]  the show?  I do.  It is derogatory.  So, you have a problem with this program and the perception that we are the talent and  the whole shock jock genre, even though, you know, this is satellite radio.  We do have our fun and take our liberties with the language and freedom that we get.  But we do discuss things that are important.  And why do you feel it necessary to demean the program that you're interned on? 
[03:43:30]  I didn't mean to demean it.  But you did.  It was a private communique.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't matter.  Now it's not.  Now it's not private.  I know.  I know.  It's public.  And what you said on there is very telling.  Wouldn't you say?  Yeah.  You don't like the show, Adam?  No, I like the show.  I like some of the guys, some of the things you guys do.  You know, what appealed to me when I first interviewed for the show is that I'm kind  of like the complete opposite of like everything that has to do with this show. 
[03:44:00]  And I thought it would be an interesting experience.  But it hasn't been.  It's had its ups and downs.  What are the downs?  You don't like being called out on things.  What are the downs?  You don't like being called out on the air.  Yeah, you don't like spending three days ripping you apart.  No, I didn't.  You know, the talent.  That's.  Yeah.  No, that's fine.  I don't care.  You haven't seen downs.  Oh, boy.  Like what's coming now.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  These shock jocks could get some downs going. 
[03:44:30]  This.  I don't have any problems with you guys tearing me down at all.  What do you think of Jimmy?  I think Jimmy.  Oh, wonderful.  Wow.  That's an answer.  What can I say?  I say hello to him in the morning.  What do you think of Jimmy?  You've never heard Jimmy?  You've never heard his act?  You've never heard him on the air?  I think you're a great comedian.  And you, you know, you have a lot of a bright future out of you. 
[03:45:00]  Thanks.  Thanks, guidance counselor.  All right.  Go get him, kid.  Thanks.  Well, why don't we just read Adam's ideal mate statement?  Hold on.  I think we should first deal with this.  I think the good doctor's getting uncomfortable, right?  Oh, that's okay, Doc.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm just...  Watch your whip out those balloons and calm everyone down.  This is good.  You ever see the Russian police at work?  They know how to work it.  That's right.  They bust into houses and start punching faces.  We're going to be waterboarding in minutes here.  See, the bottom line is a private communique. 
[03:45:30]  I don't know how it was made public, but it's almost like if...  This is much less offense, but it's almost like if you fuck somebody's girlfriend and  they only heard it because they planted a recording device, the guy goes, you fucked  my girlfriend.  He goes, yeah, but you weren't supposed to be taping.  Right, right, right.  I mean, technically, yeah, I wasn't supposed to be taping, but the reality is the reality.  So now that it's out, that's the reality.  That's the most honest communication you're going to get.  I'm not, you know...  You're not a fan of the show.  I am.  I've been listening.  No, you're not.  Well, if you quote unquote talent, then you're making a point that we are not really talent 
[03:46:00]  to this person that you're writing to.  It's like the talent, you know?  And I apologize for...  Well, there's no apologizing.  You're going to stand by your words now.  I don't apologize.  That's backpedaling.  Yeah, be strong.  Just say, guys, you are shock jocks, and you know that.  What do you like about the show, then?  Yeah, what do you like about it?  I like your guys' opinions on politics, and the whole Don Imus thing, and how Al Sharpton, 
[03:46:30]  you know, he's basically a farce.  So the shock jock thing is a farce.  So we're basically in the same category of shopping.  Yeah, yeah.  Don, are we legally allowed to fire him?  Yeah.  Oh, awesome.  Oh, awesome.  Okay, those are the things you like.  Some of the takes on race and stuff like that.  But I enjoy your viewpoints on the topics on the news.  Remember, Dr. Z on scoring. 
[03:47:00]  That's the book.  Well, she's covering up her boobs.  She's getting really uncomfortable.  So she feels a little better about it.  No, I'm not uncomfortable at all.  Oh, good.  What's his mission statement?  Yeah.  Going down in flames.  So my ideal mate, when asked to pen a paragraph about my potential soulmate, I was confused  and all at Twitter.  I seriously don't know what constitutes the one.  For myself, it's no secret that I'm a closet lunatic.  I would enjoy the company of a young woman that keeps in shape and can put up with my various  idiosyncrasies and absent-minded follies. 
[03:47:30]  It's smarts over looks, although looks do count.  I like a gal who's outgoing, engaging, and has something interesting to add into my life.  I need someone, anyone who can get me out of my lifelong funk.  He just seems a bit depressed, actually.  Somebody says about lifelong funk.  Depressed, yes.  Agreed with that.  But also very disloyal.  Because it's like this is the same shitty show that is giving you a tremendous amount  of airtime being in the show and putting you on with this 11, this beautiful author 
[03:48:00]  who's actually going to help you.  We're goofing on it, but there is a legitimate help she's going to offer you.  So these same scumbag, shock jock, lack of talents are the ones who have been giving you  airtime, which is why anybody interns for free, it is because they want experience and  they want airtime.  Nobody comes in here because they want to get coffee.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  You know, I flew my own way into Michigan to get interviewed here.  I put a lot on the line.  I went through fucking hell with my internship coordinator at MSU who is a complete bitch. 
[03:48:30]  to get here.  And, you know, I'm going to keep showing up and give it my all.  You know, I fuck up on a daily basis and I make mistakes and I've made a huge one.  You're just a tool.  You're just a tool.  What don't you like about the show?  You listed all the terrific things about it.  Anybody have a chocolate strawberry then?  What don't you like about the show, Adam?  I don't know. 
[03:49:00]  You guys are putting me in an honest position.  Let's just answer it.  Honestly.  It's all we're asking for.  Just, uh...  The insults?  The insults and, uh...  Just, yeah, the insults.  That's not enough.  That's too vague.  That's too vague.  It's a safe answer.  The insult is safe.  It's like, say, oh, I don't like cursing.  What don't you like about the show?  Be specific.  You're not going to hurt my feelings.  Believe me.  Or anybody else.  Don't worry about it.  Go ahead.  Let it rip.  Be honest. 
[03:49:30]  Just, I don't know.  The environment is, uh...  Hostile?  You know, I've been...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been around the intern circle three times, and this is by far the most hostile environment.  And, like, I have a target on my back every day.  And, you know, it kind of sucks.  Um, because, um, you know, people, it's, it's just, the environment does it for me, because, 
[03:50:00]  like, my, I don't know.  So, when guys catch you, like...  You're not very good at expressing your emotions.  No, he's not.  You need to be a little more specific.  Work on, you know, work on the words that describe your, your feelings.  But you, you, you come in, and, like, we ask you questions, and you tell, like, half-truths  about them, and all these weird things.  And we're like, well, how can we trust you around our stuff if you have, you, you have  a...  How do you expect us to trust you?  We're dicks for, for not trusting you when you... 
[03:50:30]  We've got a double agent here.  No, I, I...  She knows something about...  I have so be a talk.  She knows something about double agents.  Of course she does.  And double Ds.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, the, the, the talent made a joke.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Did that upset you?  No.  What don't you like about this show?  It's not about the environment.  Yeah.  Be specific.  Yeah.  You're not being specific.  You're being safe.  The, the environment is one thing.  That's a working environment.  The show itself is where that talent thing comes in, where you put it in quotation marks.  That means you don't feel that the staff on the air is talented. 
[03:51:00]  What don't you like?  What made you think that and want to, uh, tell somebody that, uh, the talent, as you see  it, isn't really talented?  Well, no, you guys, you guys are talented.  Well, um...  But there, there's a problem there.  What is it?  Yeah, I, I don't know.  I, just...  Yeah, you just don't fit in.  Say it.  But no, let's hear what he has to go.  Say what the problem is with the show that you don't like.  What parts of the show?  I mean, I, I just don't, um, I don't know. 
[03:51:30]  I can't, I can't.  Yes, you can.  You guys, you guys, you guys blindsided me with, with that email, and I, I, I, you know,  I, I just don't have, I don't have a response.  Yeah, I, I was honestly blindsided by that email, and, uh, you know.  Because you didn't, excuse my interruption, you didn't, like, you didn't attack the environment.  If he had said, like, the environment was kind of a great idea.  I didn't, I didn't say, I didn't say.  It was the show that you deemed, you know, not talented.  And the shock jack things are farce.  What's that mean?  The shock jack things are farce.  Yeah, what did you mean by that?  Be a little, uh, descriptive there. 
[03:52:00]  I don't know.  I, I...  You mean deep inside, they're all sensitive and caring type of guys.  That's not what he meant, though.  No.  So it's all, just an air they put on.  She's, I like the doc, because she's in very good shape, although she, there's a little  codependency she has to it.  I kind of like, I kind of like watching this, there's an alcoholic in the, in the childhood  which is now being rescued.  That's what this is.  Yeah.  That's slyly, because she's very...  Trying to be the diplomat.  She's almost flawless.  You're like, oh, okay, she's human, too.  Yeah.  He has that, that need to rescue. 
[03:52:30]  Um, we're gonna just move on and plug.  It's just, it's painful to watch, you guys.  It's like, it's like an inquisition.  It's like KGB, you know?  Yes.  We're all, like, torturing this.  We're asking the guy for honesty.  We're not threatening him.  We're not, we're not humiliating him.  He said some shitty stuff.  Is that a gulag?  That he meant.  He meant what he said, so we're asking simply for explanations.  No one's berating him for it.  Why is he still in the room?  No one is...  I would like to know what he meant.  I think it's a fair question, Adam.  I don't think that's a horrible question. 
[03:53:00]  Well, it's funny, when I was walking out the other day, after all that craziness on  the hour, look, I go, good job today.  That's what I say to you on the way out.  Good job today.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you know, that's kind of like letting you know, like, it's in the theme of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  But I live under the bus, so I never feel bad through one either.  I get that.  I, you know...  Yeah, you're not the only person that's been thrown under the bus.  I understand that.  Every single fucking person.  You post on message boards?  I'm sure he does.  No?  No.  Interesting.  I have a...  Yeah, you got a name.  Membership to the...  Yeah.  The...  Whack bag.  Yeah, but I don't post. 
[03:53:30]  I just...  What's the name?  Intern Adam.  Intern Adam.  No posts.  Zero posts.  Zero posts.  I just...  Never posted.  No.  No.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, okay.  Interesting.  And I just do it to observe the rundowns and everything.  Just to lurk.  A little lurking worm.  Don.  I like that.  Don's here.  Why don't you go have the talk with him?  You know.  Well, I go.  We should finish...  You know, the talk that happens from time to time to time.  Well, we didn't hear any real information here.  I think it's fair.  Yeah, you're not being forthright with the information that you put in that letter. 
[03:54:00]  Kenny is in studio.  Intergator.  This is never good.  I think he's shut down now.  You're not going to get anything more out of him.  Oh, well.  Kenny knows how to do it.  Kenny, this is his...  Kenny's the equivalent of the most...  Take the worst KGB agent.  Yeah.  That the other agents go, oh, don't do that.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what Kenny is.  Remove all moisture from his hair.  You better get topless because this is going to get ugly. 
[03:54:30]  No.  Kenny's very much a machine in the fact that he doesn't even make jugs.  So just guess to the facts.  You know, I walked in in the middle of this.  I wish I heard the whole thing.  But the one thing I picked up on, you said you got a target on your back.  Why do you think that is?  Well, I just...  I don't kind of fit in the environment.  I try to be outgoing and I'm very eager.  And the first couple days, I know I had an indiscretion with you.  And we got off on the wrong foot. 
[03:55:00]  And people kind of just saw this.  What was it, Adam?  Can we ask you...  I don't even know what that was.  What was the indiscretion with Kenny?  I don't know what that was.  I got you the wrong apple.  And I forgot to give Kenny the receipt and the penny back.  And I said...  And I came back.  He was reading in the room.  I came back and I go, hey, I'm sorry about the penny.  And I patted him on the back.  And he goes, for the penny or for interrupting me? 
[03:55:30]  Or for touching me?  And it was really awkward.  And that was like my second day.  Well, the first day I gave you the flu.  So you had a really good start.  First day he walks in, right after...  Remember I came to work with the flu and I'm like...  I'm basically bleeding from my eyes, my nose, my ears.  And I don't have enough tissue.  So I'm just wiping with my hands.  And this kid comes in and shakes my hand right off the bat. 
[03:56:00]  So I go, ah, now you got the flu.  I guess we're not going to find out why you don't like the show.  Yeah.  No, I...  You know, I...  He's just trying to play it many different ways.  Because obviously this person back in Michigan wouldn't like this type of show.  No, it's well above it.  So he's catering to his professor.  He's catering to us.  He's catering to the other...  Whatever's convenient for Adam.  No.  Didn't take long for your lies to trip you up, did it?  No one knows who the real Adam is.  Because he caters to everybody. 
[03:56:30]  He tries to cater to what we think we want from him on the air.  He caters to the professor.  You're a phony, man.  Didn't take long for your lies to unravel.  No, I'm not a phony.  Oh, complete phony.  You're a complete phony.  Yeah, the professor would not like this type of show.  So of course you're going to write an email with like little shock jock and quotations and farce and all that.  Because that's what the professor needed to hear.  He wouldn't like a show like this.  No.  So that's your way of kissing up to him.  And then you give us a line of shit. 
[03:57:00]  And oh, Adam.  Dr. Z, I was almost a psychologist.  Yes.  Yeah, very good.  We could do a lot of, you know, exchanging of notes.  Well, I think, you know what, I don't think he has a stable self-image.  Not at all.  So it's like he's vacillating.  Like, do I, am I, do I like this show?  Am I, am I like this?  Or should I be like more like these other conservative folks?  I mean, I think he's very confused.  He doesn't have a stable self-image.  Adam, at this point, I, um, I don't like you.  Uh, Opie hates you.  Yes. 
[03:57:30]  Jimmy hates you.  Well, no, I don't, no, I really don't.  I, I don't hate him because he gave me a compliment.  Uh, the only thing I don't like about him is that he's not telling the truth.  Yeah, he's a phony.  I would, I would like him.  I don't care that you're weird.  That's meaningless to me.  I know comedians are all fucking nuts.  But I, my only problem with Adam is that I don't think he's forthcoming.  Yeah.  And in this environment, we're on the air.  We try to be forthcoming and I don't think he is.  Uh, and that's what bothers me about him.  It has nothing to do with him off the air.  Yeah, I don't, I don't, I, I, I, I, I can't be bothered with you because he's a phony and he just, 
[03:58:00]  you know, you don't know who he is.  And let me tell you something.  Another guy that could, you know, hate me, whatever.  Me, me not liking you.  No, I, I, you know.  That's one thing.  Jimmy not liking you or saying you're not honest.  That's another thing.  So when Opie, um, uh, gets that, uh, that gleam in his eye that he doesn't like you, um, people disappear.  People disappear.  Yeah. 
[03:58:30]  You hit the trifecta here, my friend.  I did.  You hit the fucking piss the staff off trifecta.  I don't think anyone's ever done that.  You know how, you know how hard it is to make me mad?  Iraq did it once.  Oh yeah.  I mean, Anthony is almost impossible to make mad.  Impossible.  Unless you're black.  Then you just walk.  Right.  That, well, that goes without saying.  Unless you're black voting for the presidency.  Right.  Then it's easy.  Of course, everyone knows I'm a Nazi racist, but I'm lovable.  All right, Sandy Kane. 
[03:59:00]  Jesus.  He's there in the background.  Oh, there's enough tragedy going on in this studio right now.  I think he, I think he goes back to coffee detail.  Yeah.  I don't need a coffee.  I don't need my beverage.  I don't think so.  Oh, spit coffee detail?  Oh yeah, good point.  No, no, no.  Kenny, what do you need him to do in the mornings?  Because he's not going to be on the air anymore.  Tease that nice bug of flavor.  I think he should wait outside on the sidewalk and count taxi cabs going by. 
[03:59:30]  Dr. G, what do you think?  What do I think?  What should we do with him?  Yeah.  You've seen everything that's happened here.  That's your opinion.  I think because of this, Jimmy needs a bare bottom spanking.  Bare bottom spanking.  Why?  You know what it is?  I think you should, I think you should give him another chance.  I really do.  And then just put him to the test and see if he's strong enough to continue to function  in this environment knowing that he doesn't like you.  That's just how Stalin would have done it.  Good.  I'm sure he's proud.  My only problem with the doctor's advice is that in this environment, you have to trust 
[04:00:00]  him.  We all get annoyed at each other, but there has to be a trust.  There has to be some kind of trust.  And I don't feel that from him at all because I don't sense that he likes me at all.  And it's, I'm certainly fine with that, but he wouldn't be honest about it.  But I don't, I don't really interact with you at all.  Do you really want to be liked?  I'm a little bit on the air.  On the air.  Of course.  By my coworkers?  Sure.  Of course.  I mean, as much as we talk shit, I like the guys that work here.  We interact together.  I think he, you mean, he might be secretly jealous because you guys are successful. 
[04:00:30]  I'm not, I don't, I don't care about success.  I don't care about money.  I don't care.  I don't really care.  Well, everybody cares about fame, popularity, and success.  As much as you say, you don't.  And you know what we do with people we have no use for anymore?  We make them producer.  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, I guess I'm gay now, too.  It's good to have.  Your line's better than mine.  I was going to say that we give them to Ron and Fett.  It's good to have.  That's true.  It's good to have a dissenter. 
[04:01:00]  I mean, it really is.  You don't want all the ill conformists around you.  No, we want yes men.  A dissenter's one thing, though, but a guy that trashes you for real and means it is different.  Dissension is disagreement or it's, eh, I don't go for that.  But this is, in a private email, the talent, shock jock, their farces.  This is a different vibe.  This is an underhanded, I really don't like this thing vibe.  No, he's above this type of radio.  He's above the type of humor that we enjoy and have. 
[04:01:30]  You're above that.  You're a little high and mighty with that.  No, no.  And that's fine.  Why don't you guys ask some of the listeners what they think?  Oh, boy.  No, we've got to get to Ryan Starr.  Yeah, that would be something.  He's falling asleep on here.  Hold on.  This is what I don't like.  I don't like people that have the opportunity to call you a dick or a douche, depending on what the D-dash-dash-dash thing was.  What's the D-dash-dash thing?  I don't know.  I'm just saying, you have a chance to call someone a dick or a douche to their face. 
[04:02:00]  Let's say it was, I don't know, four or five months ago and you happen to be on a sidewalk and the person's right in front of you.  And he has the perfect opportunity to actually tell you off and call you a dick or a douche, chooses not to at that occasion.  And then maybe four or five months go by and all of a sudden he says in an article that people aren't brave enough to call, say, I don't know, me a dick or a douche or a douche to my face.  Right. 
[04:02:30]  That's what I don't respect.  That's kind of the same thing.  Another piece of the puzzle, boys.  We don't have time to really ask the listeners, but there's a few up here.  How do you find such douche interns?  That's an example.  I'm a former intern.  Adam is a disgrace.  You're a disgrace to the regimen.  You're a disgrace to the coffee getters.  I've never heard an exit interview before.  What do you feel your chances are of coming back to the show after your ass leaves that seat? 
[04:03:00]  I'm coming back Monday.  Oh, you are, huh?  Yeah.  Because I signed up and it's till May 9th and I'm going to keep showing up and doing what I'm doing every day.  Really?  See, the problem is that it makes it hard because, again, it is a trust issue.  That's all it is.  It's almost like we're exposed here at work.  This is our private, in a way, even though we're public people, knowing that you're disliked. 
[04:03:30]  Not on a level of like, yeah, maybe Sam made me angry.  My email was private to begin with.  Right.  And, you know, I didn't mean it maliciously.  I didn't mean it maliciously at all.  Very malicious.  I think you guys are fine.  Fine.  And the fact that your email is private, you're correct.  And, again, that's what we do to each other.  Somebody douched the email.  It happens.  Like, in my professor, he taught an ethics class and everything.  And we've, you know, had various conversations about it.  Fuck your professor.  He's a queer.  That's right.  So the ethics class, though.  I mean, maybe you're saying the ethics of privacy in email. 
[04:04:00]  But how about the ethics of honesty?  As far as being honest with coworkers when they're asking you a question for real.  I mean, that's an ethical thing, too, right?  To be straightforward.  Yeah.  Got another Al Dukes.  I hope he ends up like your coach.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, see?  You pissed off Anthony.  I'm fucking mad.  That was uncalled for, wasn't it?  Go fuck yourself.  And he's got mafia ties, too.  Anthony's never like this.  Anthony is.  Never like that.  I'm humble and lovable, like underdog. 
[04:04:30]  All right.  Can we, uh, can we.  Can we listen to some music?  What?  Can we listen to some music?  All right.  I play the music.  I make me sexy.  There he goes, walking off.  Make sure he's in the mail room when we walk by from now on.  Linger, linger.  There he goes.  Send him on the road with me.  He's a roadie?  Yeah, you need a roadie?  Someone you could kick around?  Ryan Starr.  Oh, by the way.  He, and this, I'm fucking serious.  What?  He never gets my food anymore in the morning. 
[04:05:00]  I don't want fucking cream cheese and loogie on my bagel.  Oh, uh, your mom's box.  Because he forgot to say it.  Yeah, he forgot to say that.  Ryan, this is what I need to tell you.  We, we love you.  That's why we squeezed you into this mess.  We knew we were going to have a massively busy show today.  But we figured, we'd figure something out.  So, I apologize.  Because he's been sitting out there for like two fucking hours.  We dicked you.  Sorry.  I got nowhere else to do on Valentine's Day.  You know, I know you're a talent and all. 
[04:05:30]  But, uh, I think the whole music thing is a farce.  A farce.  By the way, for the people at home, quotes are going up in the air.  Yes.  The quotes.  This Ryan Starr.  I know.  The doc has great nipples.  She thinks she's smart.  Oh, she bugs me.  She really is.  She runs circles around in an argument.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, what about this?  She's like, oh, you have this psychologist.  You nailed it with the alcohol.  She was really good.  My father, by the way.  I don't have a father, but somebody should know. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, you got something that happened.  What happened?  Codependency.  Drugs, alcohol.  What happened?  No, none of the above.  She was some codependency.  Yeah, something.  You could get into her pants pretty easily, I'm thinking.  Wow.  I don't think she'd fuck because of that.  Would you?  Thank you, Sandy.  Oh, my God.  Sandy bailed me out of a bum.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  So, Ryan Starr is in studio.  I'm sorry, Ryan.  You too.  It's all good.  No, it's not.  I can tell on your face.  I'm not stupid.  Dude, I've been in a guest at many radio shows because I'm doing gigs and stuff.  It does suck when you get away. 
[04:06:30]  So, apologies.  Because it's...  Although I say sometimes you misinterpret.  Like, I was waiting for BJ Shay one time in Seattle, and I'm like, they made me wait  a while.  I'm like, he doesn't want me on the show.  And I wound up going in and doing three hours with him.  Yeah.  Sometimes you misinterpret.  We didn't expect the Adam thing.  We thought it'd be a quick segment with the good doctor here.  You know, we didn't expect a Judas.  Right.  Yeah, he is a Judas.  A Judas in our midst.  It's all good, except for waking up so early.  Yeah, I say you could have slept.  This is the end for you.  Tell me about it.  So, Ryan, what have you been up to, man?  Been since last... 
[04:07:00]  Since last I saw you guys.  I was making a record.  Nice.  In L.A. for about a year.  Long time.  Making a good record.  And it'll come out this spring, and I get this song on this P.S. I Love You soundtrack  right now.  It's just kind of leaked out there early.  Something on the album.  Wait, what's P.S. I Love You?  It's that...  It's actually...  You know, I saw it.  I figured it'd be like the chick flick of the century, you know?  And it wound up being incredible.  I really enjoyed it.  Who's in it? 
[04:07:30]  Hilary Swank.  Is it out already?  Oh, she's good.  All right, okay.  It's probably like just...  It's like the tail end.  It did fairly well.  She's true, right?  The soundtrack did really well, which is kind of cool.  And one of your songs is featured?  Yeah, they heard...  I was still making the album, and the director came to the studio and heard a track and...  That's very cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Was it a chick flick?  More or less, but it was really good, you know?  I'm like Roland over here.  I'm a chick flick fan.  Is that...  Wait, did Roland like...  Fat with a big head.  Was that one of Roland's movies he really liked? 
[04:08:00]  P.S. I Love You?  Everyone's talking about this movie, right?  Is that the chick flick you liked that was about the musician and all that?  No, that was once.  By the way, don't try to analyze this mess.  Dr. Z.  He got some 300s in it.  Guy from 300s?  Why would his mic be on?  I don't know.  In his Goonies t-shirt.  Roland?  Isn't the doctor...  Is she not fantastic?  No, she is beautiful.  Roland, what's your favorite chick flick?  Probably Sleepless in Seattle.  Do you like Hitch?  Seepless in...  I did like Hitch.  Seepless. 
[04:08:30]  I did enjoy Hitch.  Seepless in Seattle is clucking.  Which one are you seeing tonight?  Apartment had no leaks.  That's right.  I enjoyed Hitch.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  So, very good.  That's all we need from you, Roland.  Yeah, get out, please.  I love Roland's steak.  Can't he stay?  I love Roland's presence.  No, no, no.  Roland, your underwear is hanging out of the back of your pants.  Kids all cuck.  And above that, I don't even want to talk about it.  Why?  Because I saw ass crack and hair.  And sweat. 
[04:09:00]  And sweat.  Roland's nervous.  I'm not going to sit here turned on like this.  All right.  See that?  Goes left.  All of a sudden, he goes right.  Zigging and zagging.  She's very uncomfortable.  You're uncomfortable.  No, no.  She fits in well.  I think she can hang with the boys.  I think I'm going to have a new job with you guys here.  Yeah.  Analyzing this dynamic.  Interesting dynamic here.  Definitely.  That could be...  Isn't it?  You're probably trying to figure out each of our little personalities.  Wait.  All right.  She's been here two hours.  What did she think of me?  Before...  Give us one sentence on us three. 
[04:09:30]  Jimmy, myself, and...  Yeah.  How do you see us?  First impressions.  Yeah.  First impressions.  But with your professional abilities at reading people.  And please make sure you add the word adorable when you talk about me.  That's right.  Actually, I am.  You're an adorable douchebag.  He's got a nice smile.  He's a little bit sarcastic.  But deep inside, like sensitive.  There's a sensitive quality.  Fuck you, man.  Because you got really upset about this whole treason thing. 
[04:10:00]  I mean, you took that seriously.  Well, yeah.  So you're like...  There's a little loyalty.  I have extreme loyalty.  And people have a tendency to trash me after they leave the Opinion Anthony show.  So, yes, you read that perfectly.  Yeah.  There's like actually...  Perfectly.  And these people forget what I've done for their fucking careers.  And I'm not one to like, you know, brag about it.  But it's like, oh, whatever.  She nailed it.  She fucking nailed that.  I think you actually go out of your way to help people.  Thank you.  Thank you, good doc.  You know what? 
[04:10:30]  I'm wondering this whole force thing.  I'm wondering if what he was trying to say.  And now there was an element of jealousy and sarcasm.  I think there's a definite jealousy there.  I think, you know, he's kind of like socially maladroit kind of guy.  Like having difficulties with women.  And here you are.  You're like popular, funny.  And it's like he doesn't feel like he's fitting in.  I think he thinks he's better than us.  And he can't believe that we're successful doing what we're doing.  But it's a self-defense kind of thing.  It's like I've got to put them down in order to feel better.  But deep inside, he's got some...  He's hurt. 
[04:11:00]  All right, Johnny Cochran.  You don't have to sit there and defend him.  Because now I'm on goal.  I'm not really defending him.  I mean, I do think he has an unstable self-image.  Which is, you know, somebody...  People don't like to be around somebody who doesn't know who he is.  I mean, he's trying to be one person and he's trying to suck up to his professor.  Do you mind if I pee in a water bottle?  Because I have a leak.  Oh, jeez.  No, don't do that.  I'm here.  Move on to Anthony.  Because we've got to get to Ryan Stark before noon.  Jesus.  Anthony.  Anthony is...  He's a bit tougher than Opie. 
[04:11:30]  He's got a tougher shell.  He is funny.  He is...  I mean, you guys are a lot deeper than you try to be.  You try to come across as shallow guys, but you're both a lot deeper.  Fuck this chick.  God, I hate you.  He's killing that.  Yeah, definitely.  Jesus, I got to cover up.  Yeah, there's under this...  I'm feeling nude.  Under this kind of tough exterior, there's definite...  There is a...  So you're calling us all pussies? 
[04:12:00]  No, I'm not calling you pussies.  I'm saying that you're trying to cover up...  You have more substance than you want to project.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  The jigs up.  I'm sorry for this.  Christ.  And?  Fortune teller.  I won't say it.  Fortune teller.  What else about Anthony?  I was just going to say something after the jigs up.  Were you done with that?  Make your own joke.  Obviously, it's hard.  I mean, I've only seen you guys for an hour.  Yeah.  But in this exchange, the way you handle this whole thing and how you got...  You got worked up about this thing.  I mean, you expect, like, loyalty and appreciation. 
[04:12:30]  And I think you know you work hard.  And, you know, there's a lot of...  You guys do have a ton of talent.  You have...  And then...  No quotes.  Yeah.  So without the quotes...  Okay.  What about Jimmy Norton?  Young James Norton.  Which, by the way, was Anthony's...  You know, Anthony didn't want any more attention on him.  Oh, my God.  Enough from me.  You don't want to tear away those layers.  Yeah.  He is the most guarded one.  Oh, fuck it is.  He is the biggest guard of the three of you.  You are good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is...  Yeah.  I don't tell people shit.  He is what we call psychologically... 
[04:13:00]  He's armored.  You know, armored.  Psychological armor.  It's true.  You're absolutely right.  There are very few people that I talk to intimately and that know me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  Stop yawning.  I'm sorry.  You know how many people are listening right now?  This one just wears his heart on his sleeve.  We held a huge audience for you today.  Trust me on that.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  And wears his dick out his pants.  All right.  Jimmy Norton.  Well, he...  This one's the sweetest one.  Look at the sweet eyes.  A sweet boy.  Wow.  He was voted sweetest boy. 
[04:13:30]  He certainly was voted sweetest boy.  Somewhere.  Sometime.  I have no idea when.  And he just is.  He wears his heart on his sleeve.  He does.  He just craves love and appreciation.  Wow.  It's written all over him.  Thank you.  Basically, he's a mushy fruit.  He's got a mushy quality.  You're needy.  He's got the melodramatic sentimental quality.  I do not.  I do not.  You're trying so desperately to cover up.  Wow.  You are really...  I'm not sentimental.  And I haven't felt that way since you first walked in. 
[04:14:00]  See that?  I just make a good joke.  It's the poetry thing that did it.  That's right.  I'm very good.  I rhyme immediately.  Is this the fucking dating game?  I know.  You've got to pick one.  I know.  We'll go to Puerto Vallarta.  Pick one of these jack-offs and they'll take you for a burger.  And then disappoint you sexually.  Steven S. nailed it, too.  He goes, oh.  I bet you actually...  You try to please.  You try to...  You're the kind of guy that actually tries to please a woman.  Yeah, with cash.  I'm a head freak.  Yeah, I do.  I really do.  He loves to get down in there.  Yeah, I do.  The plumper the better. 
[04:14:30]  That's what my bumper sticker says.  I'm a fan of the car wash myself.  Just going...  All right.  Steven S. verbathe.  Your Ope doesn't disturb you when someone points out that they know you actually have  a soul.  Yes, it does.  Steve.  You don't really want people knowing that.  No, not at all.  You know, we were going to just beat you up today and you held your own.  You did great.  Thanks, man.  You turned us.  Feel free to...  We were like...  We love you.  We were like a sexpert.  Now we're just going to have to start like a big...  No, but we kept an open mind.  We weren't going to go right at you.  But then you were like interesting from the get-go. 
[04:15:00]  Very perceptive.  The book is Dr. Z on Scoring and that's also .com if you want to check it out online.  For her signing.  She's terrific.  Yeah.  Ryan Starr, I'm sorry.  See, now she's reading us.  You know.  And I'm going to be the next intern from now on.  I'm taking on the animals.  Oh.  Holy shit.  You sure all you want me to do is sit here naked?  Yes.  That's all you need to do.  That's all you need.  So I want to...  Can we hear...  I don't know what song you wanted to do, man, as an artist, but I would love to hear  the one in the Hilary Swipe movie if that's possible. 
[04:15:30]  Or is that...  Is that one on disc?  Yeah, that one's on disc.  I think you guys have it.  Oh, okay.  Is it called Last Train Home?  It is.  Okay.  We'll play that.  I mean, we got that in front of us.  Okay.  But he wants to...  What do you want to perform today?  I'm going to play a new one.  Okay.  That's all right.  And then the name of the album?  The album's going to be called 1159.  Okay.  It'll be out this spring.  And you guys are like my first stop, so thanks for having me.  If I fumble over the song, it's just because it's the first.  No worries.  And then a website or something?  MySpace.com backslash rstar. 
[04:16:00]  R-S-T-A-R.  Or rstar.net.  Very cool.  Okay.  It's Ryan Starr, everyone.  Just don't go today, because I'll probably be trashing you tonight on my blog.  Oh, yeah.  There's no problem.  You said everyone needs to sit there.  All of my fans know that I'm a huge fan of you guys, so it means a lot being here.  You want to intern, dude?  I mean...  It's too early, man.  It just sounds too early.  It doesn't work out.  I'm very loyal, yeah.  If this whole music thing doesn't work out.  You know, this music thing.  All right.  Let's just call right now. 
[04:16:30]  I'm putting all my things in boxes.  I'm going to throw it all away.  I think I've got a good idea, but who am I to say?  I'm burning all the things you gave me.  Erasing all my memories.  I thought you were the one to save me.  I was so naive. 
[04:17:00]  I'm about to lose control.  Now I'm going to let it go.  Yesterday is history.  Tomorrow may not come.  I'm going to run to the horizon.  We are strong.  We are young.  I'm going to lay on the ground.  Feel the rain that's coming down.  And there's nothing anyone could do or say to bring me down. 
[04:17:30]  Right now.  Right now.  Yeah.  I think it's time to start it over.  I think I'll sell away from here.  I'm going to make a great escape.  Now watch me disappear.  I'm about to lose control. 
[04:18:00]  Now I'm going to let it go.  Yesterday is history.  Tomorrow may not come.  I'm going to run to the horizon.  We are strong.  We are young.  I'm going to lay on the ground.  Feel the rain that's coming down.  And there's nothing anyone could do or say to bring me down. 
[04:18:30]  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  All we ever have is right now.  And all we'll ever need is here.  Right now.  It's where I want to be. 
[04:19:00]  Yesterday is history.  Tomorrow may not come.  I'm going to run to the horizon like I did when I was young.  I'm going to lay on the ground.  Feel the rain that's coming down.  And there's nothing anyone could do or say to bring me down. 
[04:19:30]  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Wow.  Yeah.  Right.  Star.  That's powerful.  That was powerful, right?  A lot of emotion, yeah.  He's got a little emotion in his voice there.  Bravo.  You can analyze me now.  Because now you know me.  You really belt out a fucking tune, man. 
[04:20:00]  Holy shit.  Really nice.  That's after hanging around yawning for two hours.  That was all his built up anger and having to wait.  I want to punch these guys right now.  I want to punch them now.  I wish they would stop this Adam shit right now.  God damn, that was good, man.  Thanks, man.  If I could do that, if I had that gift, I would never tell another fucking dumb joke in my life.  Yeah.  Nothing makes women happier than hearing that.  While I'm here in New York, I've been doing these secret late night shows. 
[04:20:30]  You guys are literally waking up when I'm doing them.  Wow.  Three, four in the morning.  That's really secret.  If you can, I don't know if people are driving or not, but it's like, I've been doing it through  this texting mailing list.  I think you'd text Ryan to 50505.  Okay.  It only costs like $1,000 a tax place.  No, it's actually free.  Per letter.  I'll be texting people, whatever city I'm in, to do these late night shows.  Right on, man.  Where are they, the shows?  My room.  My apartment, downtown. 
[04:21:00]  You think this guy gets a lot of pushy, Doc, or what?  I'm sure.  Yeah.  The musician prototype is a very powerful one.  Women love that.  Women love guys who show emotion.  That's why Adam's got such a tough time with women.  He's got no emotion.  The guy's like frozen, you know, like.  Well, we're still talking about Adam.  He's got emotion.  You've got to show it.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, enough about Adam.  We've got Ryan Starr.  Listen, Ryan, this is what we're going to do.  I've got to take a leak so fucking bad.  I can't even tell you.  Can't even tell you.  So we're going to play Last Train Hall from P.S.  I Love You, and then we'll wrap up the show. 
[04:21:30]  No break, okay?  But that tits my party.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  What about tits my party?  Teddy and not love Sandy.  Jimmy and I.  How long you got?  No, Jimmy and I turned the corner on her, man.  We fucking love this.  We are Sandy fans.  We're big fans of you now, Sandy.  I used to hate her fucking got to.  Makes two.  Huh?  Yeah, we'll end the show with it, all right?  Maybe after Ryan comes back.  We'll play Ryan Starr.  I really got to take a leak.  So it's going to be Last Train Home from Ryan Starr. 
[04:22:00]  We're doing it right now for P.S.  I Love You.  Is this going to be on the new album, too?  It will be, yeah.  And the new album again?  It's called 1159.  It'll be out in the spring.  Hopefully, you'll be lucky enough to come back and do it up when it comes out for you.  Yeah, if you want to wait two or three hours, no problem.  We'll see if this kid's still here.  All right, here it is.  Last Train Home, Ryan Starr.  You haven't changed.  Stand in the light. 
[04:22:30]  I need to see you.  Uncover my eyes.  The tears coming down.  Make amends on your face.  One for each year now.  That you've been away.  If we were only kids, we were at La Porter. 
[04:23:00]  Your dad said, stay away from my daughter.  The sun was coming down when I said, can't you just be late?  And if you wait for me, I'll be the light in the dark if you lose your weight.  And if you wait for me, I'll be your voice when you don't know what to say. 
[04:23:30]  I'll be your shelter.  I'll be your fate.  I'll be forever.  Oh, wait for me.  I'll be the last train.  I'll be the last train home.  We were a storm.  It blew us away. 
[04:24:00]  I wouldn't leave you.  But you couldn't stay.  We were only kids.  We were at La Porter.  Your dad said, stay away from my daughter.  Your sun was coming down when I said, can't you just be late?  And if you wait for me, I'll be the light in the dark if you lose your weight. 
[04:24:30]  And if you wait for me, I'll be your voice when you don't know what to say.  I'll be your shelter.  I'll be your face.  I'll be forever.  Wait for me.  I'll be the last train.  I'll be the last train.  When we were only kids. 
[04:25:00]  We were at La Porter.  I told your dad.  I love your daughter.  The sun was coming down when I said, can't you just be late? 
[04:25:30]  And if you wait for me, I'll be the light in the dark if you lose your weight.  And if you wait for me, I'll be your voice when you don't know what to say.  I'll be your shelter.  I'll be your face.  I'll be forever.  Wait for me. 
[04:26:00]  I'll be the last train.  I'll be the last train.  Hold on to love and wait for me.  I'll be the last train.  I'll be the last train.  Hold on to love and wait for me.  I'll be the last train.  I'll be your last train.  Hold on to love and wait for me.  Wow.  I got back in time to hear the second half of that song, Ryan.  Ryan Starr, Last Train Home. 
[04:26:30]  And Joey Says It All from Knoxville, Tennessee.  He goes, dude, why isn't this song all over the radio?  Great track.  Thanks, Joey.  Why isn't it?  You know, you guys are like literally the first to even hear it.  What are we doing here?  Tin cannon string, motherfucker?  Oh, yeah, we do it.  You kind of forget.  We played it.  You kind of forget.  You said all over.  People are actually listening to this shit.  All over.  All over.  Spread out.  Not shit meaning the radio show.  We really do sometimes feel like we're talking to 30 people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Low self-esteem zilch as we are.  That's because we're the talent.  That's true. 
[04:27:00]  Shock, shocking.  I mean, you're already here first.  In a few more months, it'll be hopefully all over the radio.  Yeah.  And then you'll forget about us.  We'll never see you again.  Because that's what happens.  Because it's in the loyalty thing.  I'll steal all your interns.  Take them on the road.  It'll be good.  Yeah.  Good.  Please.  One thing I'll be sure, he'd definitely get more action, I think.  Yeah.  Than sitting here with you guys.  As far as your old girls paying attention to him, you know.  Getting your second hands.  Yeah.  The ones that you kind of just go, ah, man.  Hand-me-downs.  Yeah.  The hand-me-down chicks.  Another piece of the puzzle.  I'm going to play a new game called Another Piece of the Puzzle. 
[04:27:30]  Oh, okay.  Was it good enough to move on with us?  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  For the type of show we were going to, you know, we were going to do.  Buttle interview is taking days.  It really is.  It's called Another Piece of the Puzzle.  I play in chess via mail.  Because people are curious.  I love, you know, they like that inside shit.  Yeah.  I talk in code all the time.  Only a few people pick up on it.  That's good.  I like when you use Morse.  Morse?  Best code ever.  Ryan, anything else? 
[04:28:00]  You just want to eat or sleep or something.  I got a big Valentine's Day plan.  Oh.  And you go, it was the lucky fella.  This guy I met on Craigslist.  I don't know.  I think I have interns here.  You have the website, rstar.net.  I got to ask Dr. Z.  Rocks your dreamboat.  I got to ask Dr. Z something.  rstar.net.  Yes.  All right.  So a guy like this.  He's a rock star.  You said he's good looking and stuff.  How bummed would you be to find out someone like him is gay? 
[04:28:30]  It happens.  Actually, a friend of mine just found out her husband, who is up 10 years, is gay.  What gave it away?  His breath?  No.  I was kidding.  He's a politician in D.C.  We're not going to get into the details.  Oh, wow.  And so it's going to be dirty, messy, messy divorce.  How old is he, would you say?  How old is he?  He's about 45.  Okay.  It's not Larry Craig.  He's old.  Do you hang out with a lot of politicians?  Are you saying Obama?  What?  Yes, he's 47.  He's a candidate.  So she said it took her two days. 
[04:29:00]  It took her two days to recover.  She said she couldn't eat or sleep.  Only two days?  She was absolutely stunned.  Two days.  Jeez.  How did she find out he was gay?  She put in, accidentally put, she claims it was accidental, put in his hard drive, you  know, those exchangeable hard drives, and she found some gay porn, so she started to dig  harder, and then she found all these exchanges, love letters.  With the guy, she said, really, she's got, the guy's really hot.  She goes, I would have loved to meet the guy he was dating, but yeah, they turned out to 
[04:29:30]  be gay, so.  But she wouldn't have wanted to have sex with both of the guys.  No, no, no.  Because that fantasy doesn't work both ways.  They'd be fighting over the ass.  There's a hilarious video that's, I think it's up on break.com, where it says every  guy's fantasy, and he comes home from work.  He doesn't know where his wife or girl, have you seen this video?  No, no, no.  It's hilarious.  He doesn't know where his wife or girlfriend is, and all of a sudden he starts wandering  around the house, and he goes into the bathroom, and there's his chick in the bathtub getting  soaked up by another woman.  Uh-huh.  Every guy's fantasy, right? 
[04:30:00]  And then they flip it, and then they have the girl coming home from work, and she doesn't  know where her man is, and does the same scenario, walks into the bathroom, and there's her man  in the bathtub getting soaked up by another guy.  My fantasy is definitely like that.  The whole tub thing, but one of them is Andrea Yates, and the other one is getting out of  the tub like the girl lady from The Shining.  I just rip Danny's sweater and jerk off.  Food, all right.  Hey, Ryan, can we try to sneak that song on the other side tomorrow? 
[04:30:30]  Which one do you want to hear?  Last Train Home tomorrow on the other side?  Your choice.  Which one do you really want to push, though?  I don't think we're going to have time for both.  Last Train Home, maybe?  Sure.  Okay.  Well, just because it was in the movie is all I'm thinking.  Could help.  Honestly, I like them all.  I hope they're all played.  Obviously.  I want to ask something, too, because I had an argument.  On my touring, you know, when I get touring, I see some interesting things that Adam would  love to see, and there were sisters in the bathtub ones, and I told my friends, I was like,  dude, you got to see the sisters. 
[04:31:00]  You know, sisters.  I thought that was like a fantasy.  Were you watching them?  Everyone started telling me that was weird, like that's a creepy thing, and I thought, I don't  think it was.  Creepy?  Sisters in a bathtub.  I don't think so.  Nones, you mean?  That's a little, okay.  That's creepy.  Two black girls?  I don't know what you mean.  Were they, you know, soap each other?  Were they finger-popping each other?  Just shaving, actually.  Really?  Shaving their faces?  I couldn't tell if it was cool or not, yeah.  Is it weird that I had two sisters one time?  Shaving you?  One sub.  Yes, they shaved my head and slapped me in the face and did make-a-wish jokes. 
[04:31:30]  No, there was, uh, there was, uh, one was very dominant, one was very  submissive, and one, um, was spitting in my face, and the other one, I was pulling her  hair.  It was really one complete opposite.  It's twins.  I thought she would keep wiping the spit off and going, stop it.  Yeah, but you're helping out the spit.  The other one spits.  Thank you, Miss Manners.  God, it sounds really complicated.  One's spitting, it's like, you know, one's doing this, I slat your ass.  Poo, she's sorry.  Poo, she's sorry.  Yeah.  Doc, I had a weird thing happen once, too. 
[04:32:00]  I, um, uh, I got summoned to a, uh, a bathroom, true story, and there was a girl, um, in there  taking a bath, and I, I discovered, she was completely naked, and, uh, I discovered that  she had one arm, so I openly laughed and ran away.  Is that bad?  Well, what, what, what, you mean, this was the first time you saw her, or what?  Yeah, it was like, it went from just innocently, just, like, hanging out, and then, all of a  sudden, she, like, disappeared, and then, like, next thing, I don't know.  Slot of the arm.  You mean she was an amputee? 
[04:32:30]  Yeah.  Ah.  She worked in Vegas.  But I didn't know.  Oh, you didn't know, and it made you really uncomfortable, so that was kind of a defensive  reaction, was sort of to laugh it off and take off, you know.  Yeah, and then she yelled at me.  Naked.  Yeah, that's so good.  She, like, chased me out naked, yelling and screaming at me.  And I'm like, look, I can't get over the fact that you don't have an arm.  Yeah, that's so good.  Where I thought there was an arm.  It was creepy.  I don't think so.  He was trying to, he was fucking the bad guy from The Fugitive.  I didn't even know she liked me that way, and I didn't, and I also didn't know she didn't 
[04:33:00]  have an arm, so, you know, very observant on my part.  How can you not know somebody doesn't have an arm?  I'm just trying to figure out.  It happened to all of us, because it was someone that was kind of hanging around the show,  that was working for a TV, well, whatever.  She had a prosthetic arm that was really kind of plasticky, but we never noticed, because  it was so observant.  So it was in the bathtub, she didn't have the prosthetic one.  She took it off?  Yeah, I guess it was time to, I don't know.  It was a bit of a shock.  She was around the show in a professional way.  Absolutely.  And then we all did not notice.  We would make the worst witnesses.  True.  She always, little things, like, afterwards start telling you. 
[04:33:30]  That's true.  I mean, Jimmy, he's got, like, attention to detail.  I'm surprised he wouldn't notice that.  Well, you know what it was?  None of us knew.  I suspected.  I said, hey, how about we all play patty cakes?  But she faked a leg injury.  Hey, Ryan, iTunes?  Yeah, iTunes.  Okay, so you can get your stuff on, that's very cool.  Type in Ryan, sorry, it's all there.  All right, I'm adding it to my iPod today.  I noticed she cried when I did, here's the church, here's the steeple. 
[04:34:00]  Open the door, only four people.  We're running out of show, they're going to turn off the computer.  We didn't even take a break today, I don't think.  Or one break.  Hey, uh, we've got to get tits in my party on the radio, please.  Hey, do you want to see my pasties?  I've got Opie and Anthony's tits in my tits.  Oh, my God, you languish in redundancy.  We got it, we saw them.  Stop the self-dialogue, Jim.  Oh, my God, it's endless.  You never know when you're going to light them off.  I really don't.  I'm lighting my tits up in Cleveland.  No, we're not lighting your tits up.  Oh, no, no, we can't. 
[04:34:30]  No, I'm just saying Cleveland, I'm lighting them off.  Oh, you are.  That's cool.  This is my Opie and Anthony's pasties.  And then she'll be in Chicago, our tits are like Mrs. O'Leary's cow.  And I'll be in San Francisco at Cobb's Comedy Club tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday night.  I'm coming, I'm coming.  All right, we don't have time to do line of the day today.  Does this forget line of the day?  We'll save it.  Just imagine we were really funny today.  Yeah, so many.  That's skicoloradonow.com for info on great deals and 26 world-class resorts and up to  the minute, snow conditions, snow conditions, log on to skicoloradonow.com. 
[04:35:00]  That's for the line of the day that we're not doing.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Oh, who gives a fuck about them?  Ron and Fez, no.  It was only a segue into Dr. Z on scoring.  I think this is actually really perceptive.  And you know what?  And Ron and Fez, lucky for them, they get another employee today.  Yep.  To add to the mess they got already.  That lineup.  We don't like them.  And you got a new intern.  They're on after us.  We despise them.  They all look like Dick Tracy villains. 
[04:35:30]  Just a bunch of creeps.  Dick Tracy villains, huh?  Oh, gosh.  With that goddamn camera.  Our Nazis love old Anthony.  Yeah, but we don't love your titties.  Very sexy way to wear your bra.  The swaparazzi.  It's great.  Let's look at this bungee jump.  Sandy, microphone.  Microphone.  Microphone.  It's the party and I'll fuck you if you want me.  She has the worst songs.  And she understands nothing about show business. 
[04:36:00]  She was just singing into midair while people were talking.  Dr. Z takes out her boobs and everyone just goes, bah.  Sandy Kane takes them out and no one notices.  It's really embarrassing.  So they're down to my waist.  Wait till I get that doctor.  Yeah, all right.  We'll have that before and after.  That's a Kevorkian.  Let's play Sandy Kane, Tits My Party as we get out of here for today.  Dr. Z on scoring.com.  Thank you.  And we're going to have her back.  Now what we're going to do with her, I was telling her during the break, Patrice O'Neal  and she has no idea, which is great.  And Dr. Z going at it.  I bet you they'll agree with a lot.  I bet you they'll agree on a lot of stuff. 
[04:36:30]  Yes.  Patrice has just a great way of looking at relationships, women.  I'm not saying I agree, but it's just really different and interesting.  And I think you would have a lot of fun doing a show with him.  Picture Cedric the entertainer if he was broke and overcompensating.  Right.  All right.  Tits My Party, the great Sandy Kane as we leave you today.  Which Sandy Kane?  The great.  Where's she?  It's my party and I'll fight if I want to.  Fight if I want to.  Fight if I want to.

And I'll fight if I want to.  Fight if I want to.  Fight if I want to.  You would fight too at a party party.
