<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a 70-year-old woman, Sandra Hochstetler, who shot at a burglar while simultaneously calling 911.  Opie and Anthony debated the best response to a home invasion, with Anthony favoring immediate self-defense.  This led to a brainstorming session for Anthony's ideal intruder-deterrent catchphrase, generating humorous and threatening suggestions from callers, including Don the Trucker's memorable "Sounds like there's one less hat remover on the streets today."  The conversation touched upon the legal implications of self-defense and the use of tasers.

The show then shifted to a variety of topics, including Opie’s newfound appreciation for Pearl Jam, his upcoming child, the new season of *24*, criticisms of HBO's widescreen presentation and the rise of 3D technology.  They discussed George W. Bush's final press conference, focusing on his admission of mistakes, particularly regarding the Iraq War and the "Mission Accomplished" banner.  The declining relevance of print media and the impact of readily available online porn were also addressed.  The segment heavily featured a comedic critique of Bush's press conference, with a humorous mashup of his speeches set to U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday."  The hosts also discussed the incoming Obama presidency, the planned closure of Guantanamo Bay, and the controversy surrounding Obama's BlackBerry use.  Other topics included a pilot faking his death, the high likelihood of murder on cruise ships, the Baseball Hall of Fame (Jim Rice, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and Pete Rose), and a gossip item about Anthony's apparent interest in Ann Coulter.  No studio guests were present during this portion.


The next segment continued the Hall of Fame discussion, expressing boredom with the Baseball and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame, contrasting them with the Air and Space Museum.  The conversation extended to Roger Clemens's steroid use, Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder's infamous racist comments, and the broader issue of cheating in baseball.  The hosts also shared their opinions on Barry Bonds and the steroid era.  Further discussion covered various museums, a listener-submitted parody of the show's theme song, upcoming events at the Stress Factory, the Mets' new stadium patch, and sports merchandise.  A news story about Roland Burris and the Illinois Senate seat was covered, with crude jokes about the word "tainted."  The majority of this segment, however, centered on a listener-submitted *Dirty Jobs* video showing sheep castration performed with teeth.  This prompted a lengthy and graphic discussion about the ethics of the practice, animal treatment, meat consumption, and the hosts' personal views on the subject, generating varied opinions and experiences from callers. No studio guests were present.


The following segment started with criticism of the station's promotional breaks, followed by a humorous discussion about a couple who married at Taco Bell and the concept of a "gag divorce," specifically one involving scuba diving.  A caller mentioned a baby born with a foot in its brain, leading to a graphic description of the condition.  The hosts then criticized the New York Giants, commented on Plaxico Burress and Tony Dungy, and discussed a story about an NHL player biting an opponent. A news story about a naked intruder ("Michael Dick") breaking into an elderly woman's home resulted in numerous jokes. A listener criticized the show, leading to a discussion of their online trading activities and complaints about the show's content.  The hosts brainstormed absurd product ideas, including self-destructing cars and cars with toilets in the trunk, and discussed a (likely false) story about a Cambodian midget fighting league.  They also covered a news report about the CIA using Viagra in Afghanistan.  A listener requested that E-Rock be slapped, resulting in Sam, a staff member, slapping E-Rock's chest.  Further stunt suggestions followed, including a “sneaker sole to the belly,” before concluding with the “silly putty” stunt and a story about a lottery winner dying of a heart attack the day he won.  The segment ended with E-Rock preparing to ingest a drop of Liquid Ass.  No guests were in the studio.

The final segment focused on a stunt involving E-Rock and Liquid Ass.  E-Rock ingested a drop, resulting in vomiting and much profanity.  The hosts and E-Rock, along with some audience members, reacted to the smell.  Footer and John from Jersey called in to comment.  Sam smelled E-Rock's breath afterward.  The segment concluded with the announcement of Bob Kelly as the next day's guest, and mention of the studio renovation impacting future live audiences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off. Good morning. Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  I think we'd get right into this and start with a little home invasion story.  Well.  I love this story. I'm not a fan of the gun, for the most part.  No?  But these stories come out and then they prove Anthony's point, that we all should be armed.  Well, we should all be safe and know what we're doing, but yes, we should all be armed. 
[00:00:30]  Somebody get a little surprise?  A 70-year-old woman.  Yeah.  70-year-old woman. It's a fine little story.  Love it.  No warm-up today.  Why the hell was this old bag doing home invasions?  Oh, perhaps I missed it.  See, you flipped that a little bit.  Ah, that's what I don't know.  Here's the story. We'll get into it. 
[00:01:00]  A 70-year-old woman in South Bend, Indiana, was sitting at home when a burglar started breaking into her house.  The intruder smashed the kitchen window and tried to climb inside.  But Sandra Hochstetler had other plans. Listen.  I know. There's somebody trying to get in my house. I'll have to shoot him.  Okay.  That is just horrifying.  There's somebody trying to get in my house. I'll have to shoot him.  That's just horrifying, though, to hear the old bag on the phone with 911. 
[00:01:30]  I'm not a strong advocate of calling 911 while it's happening.  A little too distracted.  You should be taking up a position and pointing your gun at where the problem is, and then identifying your target.  If, indeed, it does seem to be a life-threatening situation, you do what you got to do.  Maybe she had time to hit the phone for a minute.  Yeah, one of those things like, hey, listen in. 
[00:02:00]  As he's working the window.  Another thing I don't like is the fact that there's a record of what transpired on tape.  That, to me, is something that cannot do you well.  In a court of law.  And I mean, even if it's totally justified, the prosecution, if you are, you know, indicted on it, or the family put some kind of civil suit against you, that will come into play, and they will try to twist it around using that. 
[00:02:30]  So, the less pesky things like evidence you could have hanging around.  So, if you hear noise.  Take care of business.  Get a position in the house, and just firing it.  Just fire away at noise.  No, no.  Just fire away at noise, right?  Never.  Always know your target and what's behind your target.  You really, you have to know that.  But the bottom line there is, you're in a bad situation, don't be taking time up that could cost you your life by distracting yourself with other things. 
[00:03:00]  Protect yourself, defend yourself, then, you know, call the authorities to mop up.  All right, let's take a listen to that.  Call the mop up crew.  Call the wolf.  A 70-year-old woman in South Bend, Indiana, was sitting at home when a burglar started breaking into her house.  The intruder smashed the kitchen window and tried to climb inside.  But Sandra Hochstetler had other plans. 
[00:03:30]  Listen.  I know.  If somebody's trying to get in my house, I'll have to shoot him.  Okay.  I've got this poor man.  He's scared to death.  If he moves, I will have to kill him.  And I don't want to have to kill anybody.  But I will.  Oh, wow.  Wait, the guy with his hand?  I think she already had the guy.  Yeah.  And then, with one hand, was able to.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  This woman knows how to work a gun and a phone at the same time.  Who's multitasking, this old broad?  Listen over, though.  This poor man. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  I have him here.  This poor man.  Poor man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God only knows what he would have done to you if you weren't armed.  I think you've got to shoot.  Poor man.  Because you don't want to wonder, like, down the road if that person is out and about again.  Yeah.  And angry at you because you were the one that was, you know, responsible for his jailing.  Perhaps she felt she had control of the situation.  Deadly force wasn't needed.  That's why I can't have a gun.  She, you know, called up the authorities. 
[00:04:30]  I'll give her that then.  That's why you do have to be a responsible gun owner.  And that's why I can never have a gun.  Because if I'm going to have one, I certainly would use it.  Just shoot through doors.  Well.  Are you a shoot through door guy?  Low?  No.  Blam.  Blam.  Shoot through.  Many UPS guys just dropping in front of Opie's place.  I would have to shoot, though.  Guy's in my house.  I got the gun.  I'm shooting.  At least shooting at his legs. 
[00:05:00]  I think you've got to get.  Is it easy to shoot his legs?  You're never supposed to just try to shoot out legs.  That's the thing.  I just want to make a point.  Center mass.  Well, I don't know if I want to shoot to kill, but I would definitely shoot.  You've got to shoot to kill if you're shooting.  Shoot to kill.  You shoot to kill.  All right.  But the thing is, you know, she's seen to have this situation at hand.  You've got to get your book of cool things to say.  You know, maybe get control of the situation.  I'll just rent some Clint Eastwood movies. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Rent Clint Eastwood movies.  Don't go with the obvious ones.  Die Hard.  Things like that.  Die Hard.  And just come out with a line and see if they stop.  And lay down on the floor for you to call the authorities.  Should everyone have that line?  Yeah.  Have the line.  Do you have one?  I don't have one yet.  But now I'm going to have to get one.  Well, I think the listeners could help you with your line.  What do we call it?  I don't think we could say it on the air, though.  Well, obviously.  Let's make believe you're not one of those.  Oh.  I meant to curse. 
[00:06:00]  877-212-ON-A.  Maybe we could come up with, what is it called, though?  Your catchphrase before you shoot?  Yes.  Could be a nice little phone bit for everybody today.  Anthony needs a catchphrase before he shoots.  Just before you shoot.  It's the last-ditch effort line before you have to shoot.  Yeah.  That might get this guy to lay down, to throw down his weapon, to just kind of sit still  and while you hold a gun on him until the police show up. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  That's the line.  All right.  Here's the second part of the story.  I know a police officer friend does have a good one for the taser.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's when the red dot goes on the person.  It's get on the ground.  You're three seconds away from becoming a YouTube video.  Oh, that's beautiful.  I don't think the listener is going to beat that.  And they do get on the ground. 
[00:07:00]  Of course they do.  Of course.  So then he came.  The next thing we heard was a huge crash, and he crashed through a double-hung window,  and it all came flying into the house.  Obviously, after the incident, the news got a hold of her, and this is just retelling the story.  Oh, my.  And it all came flying into the house, so I had to confront him in the kitchen.  Yep.  And how did you do that?  You put the gun up, and you told him? 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  I told him to stop, and I told him to get down.  Would you have shot him?  Well, yes, I'm afraid so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  She's admitting it, though.  Most of you gun owners won't admit to any news authority that you would have actually shot.  Well, no, I'm a responsible gun owner.  I had the situation under control.  Well, I guess he was saying if, hypothetically, the guy had continued his attack on her, then, yeah, you know, you've got to do what you've got to do to protect yourself. 
[00:08:00]  Let's say hi to Don the Trucker.  Don?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, Don?  What are you hauling?  We like starting with that.  Ooh.  Domino's Sugar.  Domino's Sugar today.  Sweet load.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, here's my line.  Sounds like there's one less hat remover on the streets today. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Well, we have no idea.  She's a hat remover.  Right, right.  Hat remover.  I thought he said cat remover.  I'm like, what does that mean?  That would be silly for an old bag to wear a hat, a cat on her head.  I said hat.  What an idiot.  Why would she wear a hat?  Why would she?  You leave with a nice, warm cat on your head.  Let's say hi to Jack in Boston.  Jack.  Anthony.  Hey. 
[00:09:00]  I'm 100% on your side, brother.  Ah.  Hey.  I'm gunning the hands better than a cop on the phone.  Yeah.  Well.  You know, it takes a little while for them to get there.  So.  Well.  You gotta do what you gotta do.  What about bear traps around all the windows?  All right.  That's good for when maybe a teen is coming home from a late night and doesn't want to come  in through the door.  Is that what you got going on in your house?  No.  I'm just talking about some father that might.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I'm talking before you get the, you know, the kids and all that.  You want to live in the suburbs.  How about just bear traps around all windows?  I'll tell you one thing.  Well, if you have an alarm system in your house, you do have that option to hit the silent.  Uh-huh.  Notifies your central monitoring without all the hoops and woots and whistles.  Right.  And, uh, that would be a good thing to do right when you're, you're ready for, readying  yourself for, uh, you know, action and protection. 
[00:10:00]  Sure.  Do that.  Then the cops get sent on their way.  No, uh, pesky 911 operator on the phone.  And you got plenty of, uh, time and, uh, resources to protect yourself.  Let's say hi to Rich in the Bronx.  Rich.  How you doing?  I'm a phone guy in the South Bronx and I just happen to look like a cop.  If, uh, I'd be telling him lay on the ground or I'm going to lay on the ground.  Then I guess I'd proceed to go through his pockets, rob him, tie him up and stick him 
[00:10:30]  outside the door.  Rob the guy.  We're looking for, we're looking for a catchphrase for Anthony just before he possibly will shoot  the guy.  Kind of like, you know, you got to.  This is the line, not before you shoot him.  Right.  It's not the line before you shoot him.  It's the line to keep from having to shoot him.  Right.  The line, the line that makes him lay down and stop what he's doing.  But it also could be the line before you shoot if, if they're not listening to you after 
[00:11:00]  that.  Hey, what's up?  I just want to be your friend.  Uh, let's play, uh, Twister.  Lay down.  All right.  Let me go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, the guy's trying to work his lay down line.  It's not working.  Hey, little Jimmy, this Saturday in the, for God, I can't wait to see you, little Jimmy.  No, actually, the big thing is Sunday.  Tickets still available for the Sunday show.  Who cares about Saturday?  I'm just, I was a bust already.  Yeah, those are the practice shows.  The big show is Sunday.  Don't you know that by now?  Uh, go ahead, Chris.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, uh, basically, I, I realized this thing is about Anthony, but if, if Opie had a gun 
[00:11:30]  and he said, uh, good luck, bro, I'm sure all criminals would get right to the ground.  Good luck, bro.  See, now I need a gun just so I could use the good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  I like that.  I like that.  It's a little vague, but.  Well.  It might work.  It might work, sure.  Uh, let's say how to Keith in Maryland.  Uh, Keith.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Keith.  Hey, uh, Anthony, you can say, uh, hey, buddy, you picked the wrong house on the right day. 
[00:12:00]  Oof.  A little hacky, I'm thinking.  Yeah, a little hacky.  A little wordy.  Um.  How about this?  How about this?  Do you know who I am?  Do you see my name on my hood?  All right.  It might be too early to do a little, uh, audience, uh, participation here.  The best one I heard was in Vice Squad.  It was a black female cop, and it was so over the top, but she was, she had some criminal  pegged, and she said, blink your eyes, mother effer, and you die in the dark.  And I thought that was a.  There you go.  Nice.  What a great thing to say to somebody. 
[00:12:30]  No bones in PA rights.  Ant's line would probably be, all right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Wisconsin.  Tim.  Well.  Yeah, you there?  Yeah, go ahead, Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, Tim.  I got, uh, oh, what was it there?  I think it was Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon tells the guy, you effed up now, Hamlet.  You kind of verbally tell him that he made a mistake before that muzzle flash drives the  point home.  So basically, you realize that your line stunk as you were saying it, and at the end, you  went, you have to very, just kind of warn him, man. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boo.  Hugh Junit says he used to be a police officer.  The line we were taught.  Can we hang up on that guy?  He is the worst.  Oh, God.  Hold on back there.  Horrid.  Uh, line we were taught was, any move you make will be considered a threat, and you will  die.  Do you understand?  Yes.  That's a good one.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill. 
[00:13:30]  Hello, Bill.  Hey, boy.  Good morning, Bill.  How you doing?  Hi, Bill.  Hi, Bill.  We're in the middle of trying to rock the radio show here.  Let's go.  Uh, Yippee-Ki-Yay, Mr. Falcon.  Mr. Falcon.  It's horrible.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Trying to figure out Ant's catchphrase, just before he might shoot an intruder in a home  invasion.  The catchphrase might get the job done, where the guy freezes, does nothing, but it might 
[00:14:00]  not do anything anyway.  If he's on the crystal meth or something, he's not going to listen to anything you say.  Still get your line in, and you, uh, and you shoot.  How about make my bed, Joe?  All right, if you want to add to this, 877-212-018.  We have a lot to do, man.  I love the plane crash guy story today.  Oh, yeah.  He's a, he's a, he's a brilliant idiot.  Yeah.  A brilliant plan, executed like an idiot.  It fell just short.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, the, the Eddie Curry for the Knicks.  Wow.  Wait till you hear this one.  Yeah, that's a surprise.  Wait till you hear this one.  You got a 107-year-old looking for a husband.  You got Bush's last, uh, press conference.  He finally let loose yesterday.  Like, we finally, after eight years, got to see the real guy yesterday as he's leaving.  His last press conference, and he pretty much was loose, admitting a lot of things.  He certainly was.  I think Stump Brain said, uh, he was, he was close to looking like he was in a confessional 
[00:15:00]  or something.  Yeah.  Confessing his, uh, his sins of his presidency or something.  We got some highlights from that as well.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Pearl Jam.  I had a slight change of heart from Pearl Jam.  I love Pearl Jam.  You've hated Pearl Jam for years.  You gotta go deep with Pearl Jam.  It wasn't even their song.  Blow off the hits and just go a little deeper.  No, I just like their hits.  I was, really? 
[00:15:30]  Well, it's really fun.  I was Googling, uh, a Ramones song called I Believe in Miracles.  I'm not a huge Ramones fan, but I love that song.  And, uh, it came upon an Eddie Vedder cover.  It was Pearl Jam.  And he annoyed me for a second because he was talking, like, in Portuguese because it  was a Brazilian audience.  Oh.  But then he belted out this version of I Believe in Miracles.  And I was like, God damn, I like it.  Yeah?  I really, I want to, I want to get it in my eye.  But yeah, it was, like, great.  Wow.  I was like, I kind of, all right, I gave Eddie Vedder a kind of beating for a long time.  But, you know. 
[00:16:00]  You certainly have.  Maybe I was incorrect.  He's a talented guy.  Yeah.  Still doing it all these years later.  Not really needing the record companies or anything.  Yeah.  Kind of doing the Grateful Dead thing.  Kind of like touring and getting really close with his fans.  Never went away, right, Travis?  Travis knows a little bit about Pearl Jam.  Travis knows a little bit about, uh, everything.  Pearl Necklace, he knows a lot about.  Jack Bauer, 24.  That, uh, the song you're thinking of, Jim?  Yes.  It's off of, uh, Lost Dogs.  Oh, is that one?  Okay.  Wow, look at that. 
[00:16:30]  He knew the answer and everything.  That's a rarities, uh, CD.  He, Pearl Jam does awesome covers.  Like, they pick and choose the covers that they do, and they're all great.  Their cover of, uh, of the Who's, um, Bob O'Reilly is probably my favorite cover.  Yeah, I like that one.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Definitely.  And a lot of people think Pearl Jam went away, but they never, they never went away.  They sell out wherever they go.  They still sell out two or three nights in the garden anymore.  They kind of put out their own stuff now, right?  They encourage the fans to tape all the shows. 
[00:17:00]  It's sort of like a Grateful Dead thing.  Everything's released live.  Yeah.  It's a 20-year anniversary next year.  God.  What a year.  877-212-ON-A.  Thanks, Travis.  You're welcome.  What are you having, a girl?  Yes.  I get updates on, uh, message boards.  Well, why would you bring it to the actual radio show, you dummy?  I was going to tell you all today, I don't, I, an email is so impersonal.  I saw it on, uh, Facebook already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you put it on Facebook and then, you know, everything's so impersonal these days. 
[00:17:30]  What does she do?  Uh, end of June.  Oh, that's cool, man.  June 29th.  What are you going to call her?  We don't know yet.  We have, we have a list of names.  No.  Oh.  I thought.  Gee, that would have been silly.  That would be awkward in school.  Yeah, we'll figure.  We don't know yet.  We don't know yet.  We don't know yet.  There was some kind of like a French sounding name, like call her a 24, but C-W-E-N-T-I-F-O-R 
[00:18:00]  will sound kind of like, you know, Jackie, Jackie Bauer.  Yeah.  I would love that.  Yes, of course you're still watching.  Why would you?  It was fun for the first year or two.  Jacqueline.  Jacqueline Bauer.  I, uh, I may have suggested that and someone may have looked at me like that's crazy.  Why are you still watching 24?  Because it's great.  It's impossible for all that stuff to happen in 24 hours.  It's television.  It's not a reality show.  It was fantastic last night. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Was it good?  I hear the new season's supposed to be pretty good.  I hope it is.  It's getting good reviews.  I hope it is because last season was a disappointment.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, they seem to, uh, I mean, they had two years to, you know, think about it  because it wasn't on last year.  But, uh, yeah, last year was...  Yeah, they just took a year off?  Yeah, well, they had filmed...  Was he in jail or something?  No.  He does tend to get a little drunk and throw himself into Christmas trees.  You've seen that clip.  Burn his own action figure.  Yes, burn his own action figure prototype. 
[00:19:00]  They actually take 364 days off.  Oh, is that what they do?  Yeah, yeah.  Ah.  Yeah, they only work one day a year, this, uh, this clown.  Nice.  A hell of a year, uh, hell of a day, though.  I would love that gig.  Very busy day.  One day.  Imagine one day a year, all hell breaks loose, and then you rest the rest of the year.  And then you're done.  Done for, uh, for a while.  Yeah.  I, I, I saw the, uh, announcement there on, uh, on Facebook.  And, uh, of course, you know, I'm very new to Facebook.  You're all about Facebook.  I had to get...  First of all, my sister gets me, uh, and she's like, 
[00:19:30]  where's your Facebook?  I go, I don't have one.  I go, I don't have enough with, you know, MySpace.  She goes, MySpace?  That's so 2006.  What are you doing?  That's, like, useless.  Yeah.  No one uses that anymore.  Well, uh, all right.  I go, okay.  And then I realized I had to, uh, sign on to it and get an account and do that because  I then had to write, uh, letters to the, uh, 15 other Anthony Cumias that, uh, were, um, 
[00:20:00]  being imposters of me.  And say, beat it, stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  And say, there's a new sheriff in town.  And it was very long.  Maybe that's the one I could use.  Hey, maybe that's the line.  Yeah, you're catchphrase before you shoot.  There's a new sheriff in town.  Yeah, I've never hung up on more people in my life, by the way.  They were just horrible.  Yeah, they're horrible.  With the audience participation today.  Yeah, they're not quite getting it.  So you got the Facebook.  That's cool.  I like you effed with the wrong bull.  That's a good one.  That's great.  That's American FGX.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, with the wrong bull. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, effed with the wrong bull.  Yeah.  It's easy to say when you're a Nazi tattoo.  When you're built like me, the guy would be like, what?  And just knock my teeth out.  Yeah, I don't know how, uh, Edward Norton did that.  Like, did, you look at him in Fight Club and he's like,  he's a little stringy nothing.  Then he totally buffed up with the Nazi tattoo.  And then the next movie, he's a string bean again.  Like the soft.  Steroids.  You got to think these guys would, you know,  dip into the steroids to get their Hollywood bodies. 
[00:21:00]  You got to think they're doing that.  I think they just, you know.  We don't know, but.  I think there's certain actors that just so get into the role.  He seems like one of those guys that would immerse himself into a role.  Yeah.  Well, he picks and chooses very carefully.  Yeah.  Well, a couple of movies.  Who's the new James Bond?  Oh, uh, yeah.  Daniel Craig.  Daniel Craig, whatever.  Yeah.  They had a picture of him, like, getting out of the ocean.  Like, it was either, it was one of the sites that,  I don't know which one, so I don't, I can't give credit.  But they're just making fun of him, like, oh, look, he's got a big, like, beer belly and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, does he?  He's all pouchy and stuff.  Yeah, he takes off.  What, are you going to stay in that kind of shape when you don't have to?  And the headline was pretty funny.  I forgot what they wrote, but it made me chuckle.  Another Bond movie comes around, you get back into shape.  What are you doing?  And then you hit the gym again and, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Knock yourself back in shape.  Maybe I should watch this 24, because I was, I'm trying to find new TV shows.  I really am.  And I just go around and around and around. 
[00:22:00]  I really believe TV is just dead.  Maybe I'm late to the party as far as saying that, but I can't find anything to watch.  Movies and, like, history, science channel, discovery, things like that.  That's about it.  And, of course, loss.  Well, we had the host of Cities of the Underworld on yesterday.  I watched that.  It's a good show, but I'm trying to look for maybe shows like 24 or Lost.  I never, you know, watched Lost, so I'm out as far as that goes. 
[00:22:30]  I'd be happy to give you the first four hours of this season on DVD.  Yeah.  Wow.  And you can jump right in.  Jump right in.  And then we can talk.  We can have a Tuesday talk about 24.  Oh, no.  That ain't happening.  Why?  24 talk.  That ain't happening.  Why?  We always have our discussions about Lost.  And now I can have discussions about 24 with Opie.  No.  No.  No?  All right.  Coke Logic's like, oh, Lost starts in eight days.  I hope you're caught up.  I haven't watched one episode of Lost. 
[00:23:00]  Everyone's trying to turn me on to Lost, and I just didn't go there.  I'm stupid.  You'd have to sequester yourself in a room with every season on DVD for a good two weeks and  just constantly be changing DVDs and watching it to even have an inkling of what's going  on.  Yeah.  It's easy, though, once you get into it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Once you get six episodes into the first season, you're just hooked. 
[00:23:30]  I watched, you know, I DVR 30 Rock.  A show that I'm sure they're going to cancel now that it won all the Golden Globes.  Tracy Morgan is just not even acting anymore.  He's just being himself.  They're like, just roll the camera.  He's going to do something stupid.  David, he was dry humping his wife last night on 30 Rock.  I don't know if it's an older episode.  I'm not sure.  That's the latest one?  Oh, so you watch 30 Rock?  Of course, yeah.  Oh, yeah, and he did the remake of Benny Hill, so they had a quick 10 seconds of Tracy 
[00:24:00]  Morgan as Benny Hill running around with the busty nurses and going behind a rock and coming  back out.  In fast motion?  That 30 Rock, man.  God, it's the funniest show on TV, and it's going to go away, unfortunately.  It doesn't do well in the ratings.  It won everything, but it's going to go away.  It's good to go away.  I agree with Travis.  Sometimes they will actually keep a show that really is critically acclaimed.  It's won too much.  Networks have this weird pride thing, too. 
[00:24:30]  HBO had it.  A show that is higher in the ratings would go before a critically acclaimed show would  go.  There's Homicide.  I hope you're right.  Have you ever watched Homicide?  Life on the Street?  Yeah.  That got no ratings, but it was so good that they didn't do it.  They kept it.  And especially since there's nothing to replace anything with right now.  Yeah.  They don't want to pour money into producing new shows, so it's just crap out there.  So this at least has a buzz.  You know who doesn't get credit?  Alec Baldwin could be the funniest guy in, I can't say ever, but in many, many years to 
[00:25:00]  be on TV.  He is so much fun to watch, this guy.  He's so dry, so funny.  Yeah.  A great actor.  Yeah.  He's always been funny, though.  Like, I know that, but he doesn't really get that.  SNL, he had some great sketches.  He doesn't get that critical acclaim like others do, though.  I know he's really famous and all that, but he is so effing funny.  That phone call was a scream. 
[00:25:30]  To know that's the same guy, that's what makes it even better.  You know, it's got me, and it got me last night.  I was going to sleep, so I throw on, of course, a movie I've seen a thousand times rolling around  the channels.  And I have it on DVD and everything.  Gladiator.  Great movie.  I don't have to pay attention.  I could go to sleep.  Why in God's name?  I can understand if it's on TBS or some other just regular channel, but it was on HBO. 
[00:26:00]  It was on one of the HBOs with the bars on the side.  Right.  So it's regular TV sized.  Right.  And it's like, why in this day and age when most people, who have cable at least, have a  widescreen television?  Yeah.  They have a television made for widescreen movies.  When you go over someone's house and you see the old school TV, it looks foreign to you  now, right?  It's dumb.  Yeah.  And it's not a money thing. 
[00:26:30]  Everyone's got the letterbox or whatever you want to call it.  At this point, let them watch it letterboxed on their square television and show everything  widescreen.  How do you show an award-winning, best picture, best actor movie like Gladiator?  Ridley Scott, for God's sake, and not show it widescreen.  It was one of the HD channels?  No.  I'm not even saying it's an HD channel. 
[00:27:00]  It wasn't on an HD channel.  I looked.  It was on HBO, which is a cable outlet.  But show it at widescreen.  Show the goddamn thing widescreen.  You make a great play, man.  Well, why should people with widescreen and cable watching a movie like that have to  watch it with the black bars on the side instead of somebody with an old-fashioned television  watch it in letterbox?  They used to just letterbox it.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And it would be annoying because you're like, I'm not seeing all the screen.  Yeah, yeah.  Top and bottom of my screen is black and I can't... 
[00:27:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Let people with regular TVs watch it that way and let me watch it in the glory it is  supposed to be shown.  I agree with you, man.  But even when they letterbox them now, there's still like a black bar on the bottom and the  top.  It's like, my TV is shaped like a rectangle.  Why isn't a letterbox just taking up the whole TV?  Oh, well, because some movies are made a lot wider screen than your TV dimension.  Yeah, the aspect ratio.  Your TV is 16.9 and some of the movies go ridiculous widescreen.  So there's going to be a border at the top and bottom. 
[00:28:00]  I don't mind the border at the top and the bottom.  Right.  I mind a square picture, whatever that is, two, three, sitting there in the middle of  my widescreen television.  And I don't want to put it on stretch because that's silly.  Everyone's arm gets fat when they go over the side.  They got Popeye arms.  Let's speed up the technology.  Let's go.  Come on.  There's no reason.  Life is flying by here.  Any cable outlets like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, any of those should be showing any movies 
[00:28:30]  unless they're in the widescreen format.  You know, I was reading an article on 3D technology, and they're ready to go all in in Hollywood.  They figured out this 3D thing where they want to make it in all movies, not just animations.  And we're at a kind of a critical time because the amount of money that it would take to change  these theaters over so you can watch this stuff might kill the technology before it could even  be used.  And there's a lot of, like, Cameron, James Cameron, what, the Titanic guy? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, him and a bunch of the other heavyweights are all behind this.  But they're like, the movie theaters themselves might kill this technology, and they said it  would be a complete shame.  Wait, 3D?  3D, man.  Huh?  He's in every movie.  Yeah, yeah.  James Cameron makes.  I don't know.  He's got nude pictures of him or something.  Who knows?  A finger of God.  But it's like, let's go with the technology.  We want to see new cool stuff. 
[00:29:30]  Let's go.  A 3D thing would be good with certain movies.  Other ones, though, just distracting.  No, I have to find the article again.  I didn't even think we were talking about this today.  But it was more than just a distraction because it was a cool thing just to do.  But now they're using it in such a way where it will certainly enhance your movie viewing  experience.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, honey, I shrunk the audience.  No.  It's like Captain EO.  What was the movie we went and saw?  Was it Superman where everything was floating in front of you as you're trying to enjoy 
[00:30:00]  the movie?  Friday the 13th, 3.  I saw it in 3D.  3D.  Jaws 3D.  All of a sudden, you're reaching out for stuff.  That's a distraction.  They're saying this is much different.  More like you're immersed in the movie.  Yes, yes.  A little more.  Yeah.  They'll eventually have it where the screens are surrounding you and it's passing behind  you in 25 years.  Oh, really?  So you're kind of there.  That, you know, I hope so.  We're pretty much watching the, you know, it's the same crap from 25 years ago. 
[00:30:30]  You go to a movie, you don't know if it's 2009 or somewhere in the 80s.  DreamWorks has a new 3D technology, but they say it'll cost an extra five bucks per ticket.  Right.  They just want to put a surcharge on it and that's one of the ways they're looking at making  the theaters profitable.  Yeah.  But it adds another 15 million plus to a movie to do 3D and that's just animated.  Wow.  So.  All right.  Hey, in other things, we got Bush's last news conference.  Anyone take a look at that? 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  I watched it at the gym and I told Stump Brain before the show, I'm like, this is why I  hate politics.  You finally get to see the real guy as he's leaving office.  That was a, that was a, that was a completely different guy than the last eight years.  He was fessing up to things.  But he was just being a human being and talking and just kind of, he was a, he was loose.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  With his last few days, he's going to have the highest approval rating he's ever had.  Oh, sure.  Because he was kind of being honest or, you know, self-deprecating. 
[00:31:30]  What's wrong with being honest?  What's wrong with just being like yourself up there when you're doing these news conferences?  Yeah, because then the other party jumps on it and says, see, do you want a man that's  made this many mistakes?  That's too bad.  The last guy, it was very refreshing.  I'm not a Bush guy, but it was very refreshing to see the guy just, you know, kind of speaking  his mind as he's leaving office.  The last guy who was truly honest in politics was, I want to say, oh God, who ran with Geraldine  Ferraro?  Oh.  It wasn't Moynihan, it was Mondale.  Mondale.  And he said, yes, I will have to raise taxes. 
[00:32:00]  And he lost 49 to 1.  I know.  In the States.  Well.  Yeah, we're going to raise your taxes.  Let's say hi to 13-year-old JC.  He might be 14, but we don't want to know.  He's going to be 13 forever.  What's up, JC?  13 in April, boy.  Four months, baby.  All right.  I actually, a friend of mine is the CEO of a company, and they're working with...  I love this kid.  What?  JC, roll.  How is a friend of yours a CEO of a company?  No, no, a friend of mine's there.  Lemonade stand?  My bad.  I'm tired. 
[00:32:30]  Leave me alone.  Oh, Jimmy.  See, a lemonade stand, Inc. is exactly where I was going with that.  So your friend's father...  Right next to windows.  Yeah, your friend's father's a CEO.  Yeah, my friend's father.  I'm bad.  All right.  You're a rich, privileged kid.  I hate you in a way.  I'm not.  I think I wanted to be you when I was growing up, but instead I was poor.  Okay.  And not loved by my body.  He's like, okay, shut up.  All right, got it, Jason.  I'm busy here.  Playing the world's small filing for you, Obie.  You're a little effer. 
[00:33:00]  Anyways, thank you.  Once again, thank you.  I give so much to the show and you still just call me an effer and an ass.  He's so right.  Yeah, you're right.  What can I tell you?  First off, the bit that Coach for Dave did was amazing.  Wait, which bit?  Are you being sarcastic?  Because he sucked on our show yesterday.  It was so funny.  My dad and I had to pull over on the road we were laughing. 
[00:33:30]  Well, when we put the liquid A on him?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah, well, we ruined that because we had Dave on yesterday for half hours.  Probably the worst radio we've done in two months.  Thanks, David.  Wonderful.  You screwed up the show, David.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead, JC.  Okay, they make these TVs that it's the way you perceive it.  It's actually 3D, most of the movie.  And they're working on getting one of these into the Super Bowl stadium, maybe, for next year, I think. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, it's a technology where you don't have to wear the dumb, stupid paper glasses and stuff.  Yeah, they make you look like a Martian.  It's like red and blue.  Yeah.  Yeah, or they put polarizing lenses on either eye.  No, it's completely different than all that.  They're advancing this technology.  I don't have time to read all this.  I think that's the article you were mentioning.  Was it in the New York Times?  Yes, it was. 
[00:34:30]  You sure it wasn't a placemat?  I knew you were going to go there, but I remember this one.  It was the New York Times.  It was yesterday in the business section, my friend.  Best story, by the way, in the last two years is when you came in.  Yeah.  And you said, my girl pointed out that it was a placemat.  A placemat at a diner.  And he had said, that's the story I read in the New York Times.  Couldn't.  It's perfect.  It's the best conclusion ever.  I can't do a story.  No, I was reading the business section.  Opposite ends of the spectrum on, like, literature or, what am I trying to get, news? 
[00:35:00]  Well.  It's just either the Wall Street Journal or a placemat.  You know, something right next to what you read was a little maze that you'd fill out with a crayon.  Those mazes are very easy.  I got that.  Knocked.  All right, JC.  Thank you.  See you later, boys.  All right, JC.  And talk to you later, I guess.  For the people that need to know more, Hollywood finds headaches in its big bet on 3-D.  So it's a very different 3-D technology than we all know. 
[00:35:30]  And I was going to say, not love.  I don't love it.  The other thing in the business section of the Times yesterday, I'll tell you this much.  You know the whole music downloading with iTunes?  Yes.  Some people are saying that they should be doing that with?  Movies.  No.  Prostitutes.  No.  Any other guesses?  Because it works so well for the music industry.  It actually saved the music industry.  Yes, it did.  Yeah.  They said something like a couple billion downloads alone last year at 99 cents a pop, 
[00:36:00]  making the music company some money when they thought they were dead in the water.  Yeah.  So somebody in this article said they should be doing it with blank as well to save this industry.  Scarves.  What did you say?  Cars.  I said scarves.  Oh, it sounded almost the same.  Uh-huh.  Um, is it something, entertainment?  Um, in a way, I guess.  Books?  Not books.  Oh.  Although they got that book thing figured out. 
[00:36:30]  The Kindle?  Yeah.  The Kindle.  I'm getting that.  Where you're like, it's the thing, you download the book and then you can flip it like this,  like your iPhone?  Oh, yeah.  From page to page?  Yeah.  I'm getting one of those.  Yeah?  Yeah, I kind of like that.  The first ones that came out a couple years ago were way too big.  It was almost like carrying a laptop around, but this thing is nice and small, you download  your book, and you can actually feel like you're flipping pages.  I like that, too.  I got one that downloads books and then it shows pictures of them and sound.  Yeah, I know.  So you read the book that way. 
[00:37:00]  You're not a big reader.  By watching it and listening to it.  It's weird you're not a big reader because you're very knowledgeable.  I read things like Popular Mechanics and NRA magazines and other periodicals more  than novels.  Well, they're suggesting, you know, the iTunes music download thing, they should do it with  news.  News?  News.  Don't they?  Oh, you mean on a paying basis?  Yes.  And when I read that and it scared me, because eventually you're not going to be able to 
[00:37:30]  do anything on the internet for free.  You know that, right?  But the thing is, let's take a site like Drudge.  Right.  It gets a lot of hits on a daily basis.  Right.  A lot of people get their news from Drudge.  Right.  Drudge makes money off of advertising.  Right.  They're saying the advertising is not keeping up.  Really?  Yes.  Because the New York Times and all these papers are trying to go online to try to get the  advertising to keep them, you know, in business.  So someone's suggesting maybe you should be, you know, downloading your news for a fee. 
[00:38:00]  That's crazy.  Well, I don't think it's that crazy.  What would it be?  I think...  Download a story at a time for 99 cents?  Look, dude, I only read the first two paragraphs.  Okay.  You get everything you need in the first two paragraphs.  The rest is just fluff.  There might have been something cool later on in the article.  When, how?  Yeah, they give it all to you in the first two articles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, first two paragraphs.  I don't see how that works. 
[00:38:30]  Well, there was a time when, you know, people would say, wait, I'm going to have to pay to  download my music on the internet?  You're crazy.  Yeah, the thing is...  You can't touch music without paying for it now online.  I'm still listening to songs that I downloaded years ago and paid for.  You're not going to be like, hey, dude, let me check out this news story from a year and  a half ago.  It's not something that's keepable.  I understand, but these...  It's perishable. 
[00:39:00]  But these papers are bankrupt.  That's their problem.  They're going to have to figure something out.  In a couple of years, we're not going to have newspapers.  We're not going to have newsstands, man.  No.  No way.  We're wearing Mylar clothes.  No, I'm serious.  Newspapers are going to go away.  They're going bankrupt now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  New York Times, one of the biggest papers.  I was reading a book last night, and they referenced, like, the New York Times from 1856  or something.  Something like that.  I'm like, wow, it's been around that long, and we're going to watch the...  I call it the good old days.  We're going to watch the death of these papers that have been around forever. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  In our lifetime.  Yeah, but they do have an online presence.  They're not happy with their online presence.  Well, that's because they're in a transition period, and they're still spending too much  money on the goddamn paper version, when you really don't need the paper version of  papers anymore.  Right.  And you just pop on news sites.  I'm on news sites every night, just trolling.  And I don't need paper newspapers anymore. 
[00:40:00]  What do you need that for?  What's the cutoff, you think, of buying a newspaper these days?  What do you mean?  The 20-year-olds are not buying newspapers.  No, no, no.  They are?  Travis, they're not.  No.  Well, you buy a paper because you're part of a radio show.  You're in a stupid business.  You dummy.  I'm talking about the average person walking around.  If you're in your 20s, I don't think you're walking up to a newsstand and buying newspapers.  If something's got to go under your piddling dog, Dexter, yeah, you're probably not getting 
[00:40:30]  all your info online.  What's the cutoff age, you think?  I would say 23.  People in their 30s still buying newspapers as they're going to work?  Yeah.  It's a ritual.  Yeah.  You hold the paper out.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But the new generation, as they come up, they look at us like, why are you buying a newspaper?  That's stupid.  Everything I need, I just get online.  Like, if you're a guy in the trades and you're on job sites, you're not there with a laptop  and you don't bring your computer to work with you. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  So if you're sitting there with your cup of coffee during a break or lunch, you're grabbing  a newspaper.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There are a lot of other jobs where people sit in front of computers all day.  They don't need newspapers.  So it all depends.  I don't think there's enough people, though, that really need newspapers.  But you understand what I'm saying?  Like, there's something, it's a sweeping change that's happening.  The older demos definitely still buy newspapers.  But as the younger generation gets older, they're pushing out the newspapers. 
[00:41:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Well, look at the porn magazine industry.  Oof.  Same thing.  You know, you look at...  Why would you buy a porno in this day and age?  It's...  Why would you buy a porn magazine?  Why would you buy Swank?  Oh, dear.  Or we.  We.  When you could just go on, instantly see hardcore pornographers.  Well, they're saying the porn industry is getting killed for the first time in many  years because, you know...  People broke.  You just go online and you can, for the most part, for free. 
[00:42:00]  Google search with the filters off.  You see whatever you want.  You'll get enough before, you know...  You get enough to get you by.  There's still people paying for it, but their numbers are down.  Enough to have to wash your hands.  Because they're saying more and more people are just getting it for free because there's  so many women just willing to give it away for free on the internet with the cams and  everything.  Yeah.  Again, based on advertising and not subscriptions and things like that.  Right.  All right.  Enough good free samples. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That's all you need.  That's good.  You know how to...  You say today is still around and back to the future.  Yeah, it sure is.  And that's 2015.  That's dumb.  That's not a real headline?  No.  Of course not.  That's...  That's a...  Hoverboard Rampage Destroys Courthouse.  Yes.  Drift Tannen.  No, no, no.  Drift Tannen is...  The gang was jailed.  Not today.  So yeah, here we go.  In front of the courthouse.  Matt B. from California.  Oh, I'm 22.  I don't remember the last newspaper I bought. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's...  Maybe he's just an idiot.  Huh?  Nah, nah, these kids, they're online doing everything they need.  That is kids today.  Everything.  Maybe he has a goldfish thing and he bought it eight seconds ago and doesn't remember it.  And he's getting another one and he goes, you know what?  Oh, I don't remember what I just sent you.  I don't think they're buying magazines.  I don't think they're buying newspapers.  And I think these, you know...  I was distracted.  It's blackberries that are making papers obsolete. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, blackberries.  That's it.  Other, you know...  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  Bush's last news conference.  That's where we were at.  We'll get right into this after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  Opie and Anthony.  Hope you're doing well.  It's going to be cold in New York the next three days, huh?  Yeah, I guess the whole northeast is going to be pretty frigid.  Apparently some cold weather's been over like Alaska for a long time. 
[00:44:00]  And now little pieces are kind of breaking off and making their way here.  Although they were getting like 15, 20 degrees below zero.  They got to live in that crap.  We're going to be in the like low to mid double digits, you know, 14 degrees, 12 degrees.  You know, when people are bitching, it's going to...  The high is going to be 23 tomorrow, 26 Thursday, 20 Friday.  I heard that.  And then it slowly...  That's the high, though. 
[00:44:30]  That's the high.  It's crazy.  That's easy.  We could do that.  That's cold.  That's easy.  Brr.  When I lived in Buffalo, we had a month straight of that type of weather.  That's Buffalo.  Single digits.  Single digits for a month straight.  No joke.  It was...  It made you almost weak.  It was so effing cold all the time.  Oh.  All right.  We got Bush's last news conference.  I was really enjoying it yesterday.  And I don't really...  I don't really like politics.  But it was kind of cool to see him being real for once, for the first time in eight years. 
[00:45:00]  He was trying, in one speech, to change his image.  Kind of change what people are going to think of him in the future, his legacy.  He was just trying to, like, recoup everything with an all-in.  Yeah.  I don't know if it worked.  He came off sounding a little kooky. 
[00:45:30]  You think?  Yeah, he came off sounding pretty kooky.  He was getting a lot off his chest.  Yeah, that's what it was.  You know, whatever.  I don't know if it was cathartic for him or if it was calculated.  I think he's trying to get it all out there because starting next week, all the cameras go off.  Yeah.  It's a lot harder to just get the press together and go, hey, I got something to say.  Good for you.  And he doesn't even have, like, a pain in the ass Budinsky wife that's going to keep him in the news like Hillary. 
[00:46:00]  No, he's going to disappear, this guy.  You're not going to hear from Bush, for the most part, for the next few years.  He said that.  He said, starting Wednesday, I'm going away.  I've had my time in the Kleeglides.  I'm out of here.  He's going to be like Lyndon B. Johnson.  That's right.  All of a sudden, there's going to be a picture that shows up.  He's going to have one of those long beards.  He hasn't seen Johnson in a while.  Where has he been?  Dead, yeah.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Lyndon Johnson's not dead.  You can't.  Here's Bush.  Let's get into it. 
[00:46:30]  Talks about his biggest mistake while in office.  I have often said that history will look back and determine that which could have been done  better or, you know, mistakes I made.  Clearly, putting a mission accomplished on an aircraft carrier was a mistake.  That's right.  It sent the wrong message.  We were trying to say something differently, but nevertheless, it conveyed a different message.  Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake. 
[00:47:00]  He's like, things I've said, things I've done, things I backed.  Yeah.  Mistake, mistake, mistake.  Why couldn't he come out and say, wow, I probably shouldn't have said that on the aircraft?  Why couldn't he say that a year ago or something?  This is why his popularity has been in the crapper for so long, and even his staunch supporters  started not supporting him because he wasn't calling himself and his staff out on things 
[00:47:30]  like this.  And he would make these errors, and then instead of just fessing up and saying, yeah, that kind  was a bad move, we're going to move on from this, he would just not talk about it, cover  it up, have his staff try to cover it up with more crap, and now he decides to get in front  of that podium and, or behind it, in front of it would look silly, and just start getting 
[00:48:00]  it all off his chest.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Greg.  Greg?  Hi.  Hi.  He's on his delusional tour.  He hasn't said anything truthful.  He really believes that everything that he's done was great.  All I know is we can't wait for him to leave.  You know, not much longer than, you know, another.  Opie, I'm surprised.  Huh?  I believe Opie is very intelligent, but he seems to only look right at the surface. 
[00:48:30]  You really think he was telling any truth there?  I don't know what it was, to be honest with you.  I mean, I think he's, I don't know.  I don't know how to answer that, I guess.  It was either, it was one of two things.  He was doing it to try to make himself feel better after all these years of just not telling the truth, or he was doing it to try to save his legacy in one move. 
[00:49:00]  That's how I saw it.  It's one of the two things.  You'll never know.  You think he was being dishonest?  You think that he didn't believe what he was saying yesterday, Greg?  About what?  About all the mistakes he made.  Yeah, just for example, the first clip we played.  Honestly, I don't know.  Was he being honest there, or maybe saying what he thinks people want to hear?  Honestly, I don't believe that he believes that he made any mistakes. 
[00:49:30]  I think he's just saying what he thinks the public wants to hear at this point.  And he wasn't wrong about the mission accomplished.  He accomplished the mission of getting us into war with Iraq.  That was the mission.  Yeah, but I don't think that's what the mission accomplished.  The mission accomplished banner was the overthrowing of the Saddam regime.  And when that happened, even though there were many insurgents and there was a long way to go and we're still there, 
[00:50:00]  that's the way they spun it was mission was accomplished.  He was out of power.  The United States was running things.  And I don't think they foresaw the length of time and the tenacity of these insurgents.  That was a mistake.  You shouldn't declare yourself a victor when you're still fighting. 
[00:50:30]  In the interest of his family, mission accomplished.  Well, he was taking care of his pops and went, oh, wait, as far as the country goes, I guess we're just beginning this.  But for me and my family, mission accomplished.  But this is what we talk about around Thanksgiving.  Yeah, I'm not saying anything that they didn't say.  This is how they spun it when they were criticized on that.  They spun it exactly the way I just said it. 
[00:51:00]  So now he's saying it was a mistake.  All right, how about having said that, you know, a while ago, that might have helped.  I kind of like Greg's angle, though, that he's saying things that he thinks we want to hear.  Yeah.  I kind of like that, Greg.  I don't know if I could.  Just to save face.  In other words, hey, I wasn't so bad.  Look, I mean, he said that, you know, he inherited a recession, you know, at the beginning of his presidency.  Didn't we have a surplus? 
[00:51:30]  Clinton got us into a surplus, and we had the budget all...  Don't look at Clinton with rose-colored glasses, my friend.  Don't look at Clinton with rose-colored glasses.  It's easy to get a surplus when you decimate the military intelligence and other things that got us in.  Yes, we did.  Shut up.  Uh-oh.  We don't need the military if we're not at war.  Great.  Brilliant.  Why do you think people are flying into our buildings, jackass? 
[00:52:00]  That was 2001.  Yes, it was.  That was the Bruce's watch.  Dude, shut up.  You don't think there was a surplus because Clinton decimated everything that made this country strong and kept us out of trouble.  Well, now Bush decimated us.  He completely wiped out the whole economy.  Yeah, he did it single-handedly.  You're a narrow-minded liberal...  Yeah.  You're very narrow-minded, and your vision is very narrow as far as Bush goes. 
[00:52:30]  He's not responsible for every ill that this country's in right now, dummy.  No president can do that.  Yeah, I'm not a Bush fan, but I don't...  Jesus, I'm not either.  Believe me.  I don't blame what's going on with the economy on Bush.  I think that was set in motion many, many, many years ago, and we finally got caught with our pants down.  Ugh.  That's possible.  God.  I think it's very possible.  Ugh.  But I think he's being sincere when he's saying I made some mistakes. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, it's like, what, dude, the motive, there's nothing to gain for him at this point because people hate him so much.  He's just walking out, and he's at a point now where he can say what he wants to say about a few mistakes he's made.  You know, it's not like he's confessing these things that we didn't know anyway.  I think he's a human, and he just wants people, a few more people to like him as he goes back to Texas.  Don't need a military when we're not at war.  Thank you, sir.  Holy, that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard anybody say, that the United States of America, especially, doesn't need a military when we're not at war. 
[00:53:30]  We've got to be prepared.  What do we do?  Whip one up if something happens?  Ugh.  Stop it.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  Bush, last news conference.  Wow, we got some energy going.  Yeah, that just annoyed me.  Bush talks about his disappointments.  There have been disappointments.  Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during the presidency.  More pictures.  Should have been more news.  Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment. 
[00:54:00]  Way to understate that one.  He should have said that was a big oopsie.  Yeah, not having weapons of mass destruction.  Well, you know, the reason we got into the war in the first place.  Yeah.  A lot of people screaming at Greg on instant feedback.  Just want to acknowledge that.  A lot of FUs going out to Greg.  There's a nice bonehead statement that Bush made right there.  He didn't even want to fess up, and you hear him kind of stammering over how he should put that.  Right.  Should he put it as a significant mistake? 
[00:54:30]  Is that what he said?  Disappointment.  Disappointment.  What?  No, that was a glaring error in every aspect of your presidency.  He was willing to admit it a little bit.  He's not going to go all in with his...  That was the biggest mistake of his presidency.  The biggest mistake of his presidency was this weapons of mass destruction.  When you have that stupid U.N. inspector there saying, look, we'll look around. 
[00:55:00]  We had no fly zone over Iraq.  We pretty much ran the country anyway.  We weren't allowing them to do anything.  And they had no capability of doing anything because we were watching them the whole time.  But then when we hear there's weapons of mass destruction, and he gets his secretary of state and other people to get up there and say, hey, look, they got weapons.  And then everybody was like, yeah, we don't want them using them against us. 
[00:55:30]  And they go in, no weapons.  And then they change it to we want to free the people.  That's a giant, biggest ever mistake ever, ever, ever that he made.  That's a biggie?  That's the biggest.  Yeah.  It should also be said that the stock market had record highs during the Bush administration.  Of course it did.  It's not.  Why did the people that just...  It's these myopic liberal douches that just want to blame one person, the devil, George Bush, for everything. 
[00:56:00]  It's not.  Some of your dummies that are in charge are responsible for the same things.  You know, Bush, sure, he pulled some complete huge jackass moves.  It was a dope.  But you can't blame him for every ill that we're suffering now.  Christ.  Let's get back to this clip. 
[00:56:30]  There have been disappointments.  Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during the presidency.  No one can say that word.  Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment.  You know, can you pause it for one second?  I think one thing he's doing there, too, is that when you're in a war, you do have the public, but you also have the soldiers.  Okay.  And there is one point about going, hey, the whole reason we're over there is a mistake.  And it's easy for, like, a lot of people here would go, well, he should just say that. 
[00:57:00]  But it's like, it is kind of hard when guys are over there getting shot.  You know, I didn't even think of that angle on it.  All right.  He's still the president.  He's got to, you know, toe the line as far as that goes with the soldiers.  Yeah, it could ruin morale.  Beyond his own ego, there is that part of the equation, I think.  I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but they were, things didn't go according to plan.  Let's put it that way.  Anyway, I think historians will look back and they'll be able to have a better look at mistakes after some time has passed. 
[00:57:30]  I, along Jake's question, there is no such thing as short-term history.  I don't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time has passed.  Till I'm long gone, please.  Yeah.  Then could you do it?  Yeah.  All right, we'll continue with this after the break.  And also, this guy that vanished into thin air, kind of, it's a great little story.  Dummy. 
[00:58:00]  He blew it.  He was close, though, man.  Blew it.  His calculations were off by how much?  Not much, right?  A couple miles.  He should have a little more petrol in there.  All right, we'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of Chili Peppers Day.  Why, this is the second or third one?  I think it's the second one.  Two in a row, I think.  I used to be a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I was, too.  I like the old stuff. 
[00:58:30]  Early stuff.  Way better than the older, the newer stuff.  Excuse me.  Kind of taking a listen to the news conference Bush held yesterday.  There was some good TV.  Yeah.  Talking about his disappointments, what he did right, what he did wrong.  His mistakes, yeah.  A lot of, and again, just days left in office.  Yeah.  His last public speech.  Again, just stirring up debate all over. 
[00:59:00]  It's amazing.  You know, what happens when you got somebody like George Bush in there, that a lot of the  liberals love to demonize, love to blame everything on.  Then you get a Barack Obama in there, who is one of their own, very liberal, first half-black  president of the United States. 
[00:59:30]  And if things don't go well, where do the liberals go?  What do they say?  What do they do?  Do they blame the prior administration?  Do they say, well, look what he was left with?  For a while, yes.  Is that what they do?  For the first, say, seven years if he gets elected twice.  Because I know that's what happened with...  And then the last year, they'll be blaming some of the things the new Republicans are  saying.  Right.  They'll never be hit for it.  Of course not.  Because I know that happened with Bush.  A lot of people blamed Clinton. 
[01:00:00]  People still like blaming Clinton for things that happened during the Bush administration,  but you can early on.  I mean, you do inherit certain things from the former president and the former administration.  But you can't go the entire term, two terms, and blame the prior president.  It just doesn't work that way.  We'll have to wait and see.  Obama, as the president, is great for this radio show because it drives you nuts.  I like the fact that he's, within a couple of weeks of his inauguration, is going to close 
[01:00:30]  down Guantanamo Bay as the facility that is holding about 250 terror suspects.  I haven't heard a peep about where these 250 terror suspects are going.  I'm sure he'll just let them loose on the streets, right?  You think?  No.  Cuba, I hope.  Just let them out the gate.  Yeah.  Pay Cuba back for, you know, the few million they sent over here, criminals. 
[01:01:00]  Can't we just ride the hope and the excitement for a little while?  Nope.  And then we can start beating them up?  Nope.  That's exciting.  It's exciting times.  No, it's not.  It's very exciting for everybody to have this guy as president.  I don't like this.  It's a TV administration.  It's a movie administration.  We got the goddamn chick, Secretary of State.  We got the black president.  You know that, I was reading another article in the New York Times, and there's a big to-do  about his BlackBerry. 
[01:01:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What do they want to call it?  An African-American Berry?  What?  What's the problem with it?  They won't let him have his BlackBerry.  A Fredberry.  They won't let him have his BlackBerry.  And he's like, I want my BlackBerry.  He loves his effing BlackBerry.  Yeah.  And they're like, look, because every what?  Every email sent has to be documented when you're the president.  How do you live your life?  Well, how about because you're the goddamn president, and you need a secure line.  You can't be fiddling around where they find nude pictures of you after they hack your 
[01:02:00]  little site.  Well, the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry is very confident that, you know,  if he sent out his emails and such, no one would be able to intercept them.  Oh, shut up, BlackBerry people.  Figure out what he's writing.  That's so ridiculous.  He can't just, like, send off a little email to his friends that have nothing to do with  the presidency or his wife.  Could be embarrassing.  Let the guy have his BlackBerry.  Nope.  You're the president now.  You got to do everything they tell you. 
[01:02:30]  No BlackBerry.  Yeah, you don't have much freedom.  Give him a WhiteBerry.  That'll get him annoyed.  That'll teach him.  What's the idea?  You can't use anything like that, or they have a certain family?  No.  They have certain...  That is so weird, because you're the president of the freest country in the world, and you  give up a lot of your freedoms to become the president.  Isn't it true, though, that, like, Congress isn't allowed to use those, and are they?  I think they are.  Are they allowed?  Yeah.  So, let's get back to the Bush news conference. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know about you, but he sounded a bit off yesterday.  He sounded like, I don't know, he sounded like he might have been under the influence  yesterday.  Why?  Some of the things he was saying.  That's a bold statement, considering he's...  You're allowed to say sounds like...  In recovery, I have no idea, but maybe now that he doesn't have to be president anymore,  he started early.  I don't know.  Listen for yourself.  In terms of the economy, look, I inherited a recession. 
[01:03:30]  I'm ending on a recession.  I defended tax cuts when I campaigned.  I helped implement tax cuts when I was president.  And I will defend him after my presidency as the right course of action.  I love that.  See, he's a little off it.  He sounds drunk.  He sounds a bit drunk, Jimmy, yes.  Hammer the point home to everybody.  Yeah.  See, what we did, people, is... 
[01:04:00]  And then finally, this was my favorite clip of the news conference yesterday.  I believe the phrase, burdens of the office, is overstated.  Yes, Jimmy.  Now, why me?  Oh, the burdens, you know what?  Just pathetic, isn't it?  Yeah, he really said that. 
[01:04:30]  Why me?  He was like...  Yeah.  The funny thing is, he was trying to drive the point home that you shouldn't be like that.  Like, oh, the burdens of the office, why me?  But the way he did it made such a great visual and soundbite that it looked like he was really doing that.  Like, why me?  Man, you slow that down, it sounds even better.  But here's the original, just for the peeps out there.  It stands on its own without slowing down the audio.  I believe the phrase, burdens of the office, is overstated. 
[01:05:00]  Yes, Jimmy.  Why me?  Oh, the burdens, you know what?  Why did the financial collapse have to happen on my watch?  It's just pathetic, isn't it?  Self-pity.  Self-pity.  Self-pity.  That's pretty much it for him, right?  What else does he do there, Stunt Brain?  He wants to have a primetime...  Really?  ...little news conference.  Not news conference, but like kind of an address, a farewell little thing.  That was the last press conference in front of the press there in the White House. 
[01:05:30]  But, yeah, he wants to go.  And he's going to do it, right?  No, he ain't going to do it.  That ain't happening.  What?  American Idol starts tonight.  How the hell?  Maybe he'll do it on American Idol.  Come in with numbers on.  Huh?  And then we'll judge a speech.  That was horrible.  I didn't feel sincerity.  American Idol.  I can't be bothered.  Nah.  You got me into that years ago. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I was in for maybe a season or two.  I was in for about three seasons, die hard.  Chris Daughtry was awesome.  And then after that, whatever.  And then I just, I can't be bothered now.  I cannot be bothered.  We get it.  You got the goof factor guys, and then you got the good ones, and then who cares?  They got a new judge this year, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're adding in the fourth judge or something?  Yeah, that's exciting.  Or something?  Yeah, I think that's to take care of Paula. 
[01:06:30]  Paula.  Her declining mental state.  When she shows up with maybe a little back pain or something that she needed to remedy  before the show.  Whatever the hell's going on there.  Yeah.  Hey, remember this?  He's leaving office, so maybe we can get one more play out of the Sunday Bloody Sunday  remix thing.  The mashup.  Remember this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This was so good.  It was creepy.  Bush pretty much singing Sunday Bloody Sunday by U2. 
[01:07:00]  Somebody took a lot of time and effort, I guess, to clip out individual words and phrases  from his speeches and throw them together.  And it sounds like he's singing Sunday Bloody Sunday.  They're saying a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday.  Like Sunday.  I can't believe the news today. 
[01:07:30]  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too long?  Too long?

[01:10:00]  Sunday  Bloody Sunday  Sunday  Bloody Sunday  Sunday  Bloody Sunday  Nice  Don't see they didn't sing  That's a bunch of clips put together  Oh  Literal Jim  Hey  Anthony  You're getting people upset  You make people happy  But you also make them upset  At the same time  I know  I like that  That's my job  Depending on their affiliation  With their politics 
[01:10:30]  Yes  Right  Mario from West Hempstead  Anthony  Please stop calling Obama  Half black  Since when  Since when do we count  The white  And people  He's black  Anthony was kidding  Yeah  Were you  See I was being  I was kind of exaggerating  Not exaggerating  But I was kind of  Making the point  That the first black president  Did have a white  Mother  So  That's all I was doing  Is there a problem there?  It's called facts 
[01:11:00]  What am I being  Persecuted here  For  Telling the truth  Why  I  Never  Bastards  I don't care  Know what I had to do  Last night?  What?  I put light bulbs  In by my garage  Because there's a crime wave  Going on in Nassau County  Yeah  So why do you need  Light bulbs  Around your garage area?  Because they're stealing  Tires off of cars 
[01:11:30]  Oh yeah  That's the newest thing  That's happening in there  How the hell did I move  To a place  With such high crime?  You got money  Every time  I thank you  Every time I read  Something  It's uh  You know  Where do you think  Criminals are going to go?  To the nice neighborhoods  Keep them  Keep them  Where they belong  They're going to find  Better stuff  In the nicer neighborhoods  No  Yes  Keep them  They're not going to go  To Wine Dance  Or Amityville  Why not?  What are they going to find there?  Well apparently  There's a big thing going on 
[01:12:00]  Where people are stealing  Tires  Rims  And putting their cars  Up on blocks  Putting the cars on blocks  I noticed a couple  Of my um  My lug nut covers  Are missing  On my passenger side  Oh they're working  Two of them  Both of them  All of them  They're working your car already  Yeah like  Like they're gone  So now you see the lug nuts  Instead of the nice big  Caddy Escalade  Covers that  That go over that  On the wheels  God only knows  What that costs  You got to bring  That in now  And have them  Slap a couple of new ones on 
[01:12:30]  But that got me thinking  Like hey  We're you know  Were they doing it?  Were they going to take the tires  And then maybe something  Scared them off?  Yes  Of course  So now I'm lit up  Oh my god  It's like a prison  It's like a prison yard  I want spotlights  Going back and forth  Do you have sensors too?

[01:17:00]  Or whatever the hell  She was in  And she pulled up  Right next to the table  And the guy did it  And she couldn't really  Back her head away enough  Because the back  Headrest was there  Did you lose her eyebrows  I was just  I couldn't stop laughing  At the thought of  A flaming woman  Trying to  Like guide herself  Away from the table  In her hover round chair  Completely engulfed in flames  Yeah  It made me laugh  Did you like when he made  The onion volcano  Oh who doesn't like 
[01:17:30]  The onion volcano  Amazing right  And then  You wouldn't imagine  I bet you'll never guess  This in a hundred years  He's cutting up the shrimp  Right  And he takes the tails  Guess what he did with them  You'll never guess  Made cars out of them  Yes  We drove it home  We looked silly  And stunk  I certainly know  How you feel  Oh I've never seen 
[01:18:00]  So many B's and O's  Being used  Yeah  Since people met  Big A  B-O  Alright  Yeah  He did the old  Flip him into the hat  In the pocket gag  Oh very nice  Yeah  Why do they have the same act  All these guys  You would think they would  You know  Doesn't matter where you go  They do the same exact stuff  And then there's things  That they do 
[01:18:30]  That are just useless  Like the little  Things that they put  The sauces in  When they're  Separating them  It's almost like  They're just coasters  But they put the little  Sauce in there  And they got to like  Ching ching ching ching  Ching ching ching  Like flipping them around  Like he's playing  Three card Monty with them  Looking like  What the  Could you imagine  Doing that at home  Pull your place out  And start smashing  Around the table  No  So don't do it here  I'll give you a little show  Yeah  Alright 
[01:19:00]  They got the hack guys though  That it's just like  Alright  Just learning  Yeah  No  I think the guy  Flipping the  The shrimp tail  Into his pocket  Is pretty hack  Come up with something  Different  Flipping it into  Someone else's pocket  Yeah  Well get someone  With a glass eye  And like  Pop it out  And pop a little  Shrimp thing  Into their socket  And put the glass eye  Back in  That'd be a great trick  See  At least it's original  Sure  Some old lady  Comes out of the back  Because the shrimp tails 
[01:19:30]  In her eye  Hurts  Or make the  Instead of the volcano  Make something look like  A human's back end  And then have the volcano  Coming out of there  To see what you're  Going to feel like later  Alright we'll take a break  The guy with the plane  We'll get into that story next  Opie and Anthony  Rock and roll  Opie and Anthony  I like this song 
[01:20:00]  Watch when the vocal's  Picking  Hold on  Here it comes  Damn  877-212-01A  You got a hickey  On your neck Jimmy?  Yes  Yeah  On his chest too  No we saw the chest ones  Last week  Now they're moving up  Toward his  His face  I want a hickey Jimmy  Give me a hickey  I would love to  I would make this noise  While I sucked you down  You did say 
[01:20:30]  Sucked my neck  Yes  It sounded like  Something else  Really did  No  Alright  No  Okay  Neck  And what do we got  On this pilot  A lot of people  Talking about this guy  He wanted to fake  His own death  Or something  Ah yeah  He was in a bit  Of trouble  Yeah a little  Financial trouble  Who was the guy  That did it back  In the day  Possibly Cooper  What was his name 
[01:21:00]  D.B. Cooper  What?  Johnny Cash  D.B. Cooper  No Johnny Cash  In an episode of Columbo  Really?  Yeah it was a  Double episode  He sang a song  And it was great  And he was on tour  But then  He faked a plane crash  To kill  I believe his  Wife was it?  Yeah  You do realize  That we're trying  To still relate  To the kids out there  Right?  What?  You're referencing Columbo  First of all  Who's trying to relate  To the kids out there 
[01:21:30]  At this point?  I think we are  Oh Uncle Paul  Columbo  I didn't even know  Alright Johnny Cash  Was on Columbo  Yeah  So they were doing  A Cooper thing?  Yeah they were doing  One of those things  Where he was in a private plane  And uh  Torn from the headlines  Or something  Stripped from the headlines  Right right right  Uh  He didn't try to  Fake his own death though  He was killing his um  His uh wife  I believe  Or tour manager  Or something  And um  And he lived through it 
[01:22:00]  Ah  But he parachuted out  And then got rid of the parachute  And laid in the wreckage  And they found him  And the whole thing was  That they were gonna then  Canvass the whole area  Looking for this parachute  At the end of the episode  Uh  They didn't know where it was  Or anything  But Columbo did that  Just so he could catch him  Out there looking for it  And then the spotlight  Comes on the headlights  Of Columbo's car  And  Oh they caught him  Always catches him like that  Yeah he was smart  That was before he lost his mind 
[01:22:30]  And now he's a babbling idiot  Ranting and raving  Around the streets  That's the greatest thing to do  When you're in Hollywood  Is  Follow him for a while  Yeah  Peter Falk right  Just babbling his way  Through the whole day  Poor kook  So this Indiana pilot  I don't really have the facts  So what happened  He had some businesses  That were going bad  Or investors or something  Yeah the guy was in  Financial jam up  So he decides to fake  His own death  Yeah  So he's got a private plane  Yeah  He takes off  And then 
[01:23:00]  About three quarters  Of the way through  The fuel supply  I would guess  Decides to jump out  Over  Where was he  Alabama  Michigan  Alabama  Yeah somewhere  Alabama I think  Somewhere  And then  Near Birmingham  Yeah  He jumps out  With a parachute  Of course  And  Then lets his plane  Go on autopilot  Here's what I'm thinking  Though  I'm sure he wanted  That plane  To end up 
[01:23:30]  In the drink  Off of the coast  Of Florida  Run out of gas  Run out of gas  End up in the water  That way  Even if they sent  Divers in  You know  You don't know  What happened  The fish gets you  You know  If you don't find  A body  You don't find  A body in the water  On land  Eh  It's a different story  The damn thing  Crashes  Just short  Of the water  How just short  It wasn't like  On the beach  But it was  It was close enough 
[01:24:00]  Closer than five miles  Yeah  Eventually  He crashed late Sunday  More than 200 miles away  In a swampy area  So he made it  To the swampy area  Of the Florida Panhandle  Yeah  But he wanted ocean  He wanted the gulf  At least  Or the gulf  Yeah  So  I think that screwed him up  A little bit  Also  He was found by a cop  He told this cop  That he was in a canoeing accident  So the cop drove him  To a hotel  This plan fell apart  On this guy  A parachute  From a canoeing accident  He had a pilot's helmet on 
[01:24:30]  He must have been  A little banged up  I guess  And he told the cop  That it was a canoeing accident  He was close  You look at the map  Obviously we all know  Where Florida is  But it's the flight path  From Indiana  To almost the gulf  That's  You're taking a big chance  On a murder rap  Or manslaughter rap  If that thing  Plows into a house  Sure  You know  He could have really  Really screwed himself  But now  I don't know 
[01:25:00]  He's in big trouble  Is he on the lam still  No  They did get him  Didn't he email a friend  Or something  Yeah  Yeah  That's always good to do  What was he doing with that  Yeah  He  He was spotted  Checking into a hotel  And then he apparently  Emailed one of his buddies  And that guy  Ran right to the cops  I think  What a dummy  You got  I don't  I don't think he's a dummy  It just miscalculated  A little bit  But you have like  His plan was brilliant  It's a brilliant plan 
[01:25:30]  But where was he going to go  After he faked his own death  That's the problem  Where do you go  Electronically  They can keep track of you  Like it's nothing  It's easy  You can't touch any of your  Bank accounts anymore  You need your money  You got to liquidate  Yeah but if they  Notice a pattern  Where all of a sudden  You're taking out a lot of money  Before this whole thing  I'm telling you  They got you  That's what all those  Great murder shows  I watch  Where it's white people  Killing white people  Like a husband  Killing a wife  Or a wife  Killing a husband  They always 
[01:26:00]  Notice that  Like months before  They took out  This huge  Life insurance policy  Right right  It's like  What  What are you doing  You got to have patience  You got to take a little  Off the top  For many many many years  And then  You can fake your own death  Yeah you think  You skim a little  You stash it  Fake your own death  And then what  You run off to like  Mexico  You got to leave the country  You have to leave the country  But then how do you  Leave the country  Without people knowing  Through Mexico  Or through 
[01:26:30]  Yeah but I would go  To the Caribbean  How do you get to the Caribbean  If you want to fake your own death  You go to Mexico  And then you go to Caribbean  How  I think you could just do that  On a plane or something  Yeah  And they're not going to  Say  Arrow Mexico  I guess the point is  I think it's very hard  To fake your own death  These days  You think a lot of people  Did it  That we just don't know about  You wouldn't know about it  I know  I understand  That's why I asked  It's the people that get nailed  Yeah  Speaking of which  Faking your own death 
[01:27:00]  Or  Killing your wife  And making believe  It's an accident  Yeah  During our little break  We had another  Cruise ship incident  Oh yeah  This is our favorite thing  And no one is onto us  Like we are  This  We're onto this  Unbelievable way  To kill somebody  When someone goes missing  On a cruise ship  That is somebody  Killing their spouse  Yeah  Nine out of ten  I'm sure there's  Every once in a while  There's some drunk dope  That does something stupid  Yeah  Flops over the rail  But in general  It's something that is going on  People have figured out  I hate my wife  I hate my husband 
[01:27:30]  Let's set up a nice little cruise  Make believe everything  Is a hunky dory  They rarely find a body  Give them the old push  So important  In a murder case  The crime scene itself  Is so tainted  By the time  They're onto  The fact that  Somebody's missing  Can I ask you something  What kind of crime scene  Is there  If it's just a push  Exactly  That's just a little push  You don't want to see  Anything like a sign  Of a struggle  In the room though  I want to see CSI  Do that one  Things like that  And the ship itself 
[01:28:00]  Leaves the area  After it's released  By the Coast Guard  Which is usually  After a few hours  Of questioning people  Then they're back  On their way  Ding ding ding  Ding ding ding  Ding ding ding  They don't care  But also  Party time  Yeah  Alright  Yeah  Well  Don't worry about  That body  That toppled over  The railing  The chocolate buffet  Is upstairs  They just turned  The music up 
[01:28:30]  A little louder  On the promenade deck  Yeah  So you're not alone  With your thoughts  Of the horrific  Situation  Of the horrific  Murder  That just took  Place on the boat  Just turn up  The music  Shows out everything  You don't want  To think of somebody  You might have been  Right next to  During dinner  Being eaten by fish  You just want  To have a good time  And feel hot  Hot hot  You do the push  You wait a couple hours  So now it's hard  To even locate a body  If they were still out there  Trying to survive  Yeah  It would be impossible 
[01:29:00]  And then  It's perfect  Then they leave  The area  And that's it  Yeah  What crime scene  Is there  What that  And then you just  Oh it's terrible  You know what's  The most horrific  Part of this whole scenario  Now crank up the music  You're doing the feeling  So hot  Hot  Hot  Woo  Conga line  You hate the bitch  Do you have a splash  Sound effect  Turn up the music  A little bit  You rock  We're partying  Let's go  Let's get into this  We're partying  On the boat  Just had a nice dinner 
[01:29:30]  Your wife thinks  That you love her  All of a sudden  Yeah  Sweetie  We've been waiting  So long for this  Truth  Right  You  And then all of a sudden  You do the push  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta get a couple  Insults in before  You give her the push  Yeah  Well  I think it's  I think it's one of those  Situations where  You have to  Cause you're drinking  So  Even though you're  You're thinking  This plan out  Yeah  You're getting a little drunk 
[01:30:00]  So you might slip up  A couple of times  Yeah  Hey this is great honey  Yeah you  Yeah  Now go with the  Go with the push  So I can play out  This horrific scenario  This would be the worst part  Of the whole thing  And now it's like  Anyone looking  Yeah  Yeah  Alright you  Get out of here  Now you rock  Yeah exactly  There's the boat  She's just  You suck at 
[01:30:30]  Doing radio production  It ran out  It ran out  Alright  Alright you have an excuse  Alright let's  Let's do take two  On the scenario  Give me plenty of music  Anthony  Call her a bitch again  Alright  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey you bitch  No  No  No  I figure that's faster  No let's go with the basic scenario  Now you're talking blood  Now you're talking CSI  It's going to have an easy time 
[01:31:00]  That ruined the whole room  Yeah  Come on  Let's do it right here  Alright  Alright  Alright turn up the music  We're partying on the deck  After dinner  After dinner  Alright  All around me  Hot hot hot  No  Can't cave her face in  With something from the room  No  There'd be blood on it  They will find that  They will find the skin  And the hair  There's something nice  There's a heavy candelabra  There's a handy  Big heavy candelabra  I thought I'd smash her in the head  A few times first  Get blood all over your suit 
[01:31:30]  Oh that's true  Alright let's try this again  Oh damn it  We're partying  Alright  Come on  You're loving your wife  That's that's that's that  We're partying  Alright honey  I guess I should throw over the balcony  And not through the window  Yeah yeah  That would be broken glass  And blood  I throw this up all the time  Some hair left over  Oh  We gotta start the music again  Alright  Alright  I really want to do this  For real  Okay  Cause this I think would be  The most horrific part 
[01:32:00]  Of the whole thing  Okay  I tripped her  It's okay right  Well  Alright wait  She trips  Yeah  Over the balcony  Alright  And then this  Then you're in the water  Like what the F  Yeah  What  And then we'll play it out  There goes the boat  She's just  But  Why did he do that  Feeling hot 
[01:32:30]  Hot  Hot  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Right here  Very low in the background  What happened  Right  And now you're under the stars  Just waiting for the sharks  To come unniveling  Oh but look who's come to help  Flipper  I'm saved  Another wonderful 1970s reference 
[01:33:00]  Thank you  70s  Is that a 60s  Is that really a 60s  I think it is  Oh boy  Very funny  I love the fact  I love the fact  By the way  That when the music runs out  It was just  I had  The bit kept going  Yeah  But it wasn't like  Eric what are you doing  It was immediately  Eric you suck at doing radio production  Yeah I know  I apologized immediately  You know  The rock coat  Every time I hear one of those stories  I think of Patrice  With the rock coat  Look honey 
[01:33:30]  I bought you a rock coat  Why don't you get your girl  A rock coat  Yeah  No honey  This is great  You wear a coat  It's made out of coral  And rock  The fan sites  They're talking about  All the stuff we have ruined for them  That's another one  When you hear  The next news story  Where someone is missing  From a cruise ship  Trust me  Yeah  That person  Is dead  And needed to be dead  For some reason  And then the family  Of whoever got tossed overboard  Has always got some  Bad things to say  About the spouse 
[01:34:00]  Or boyfriend  Or girlfriend  They're like  You know  We never really got  A good explanation  From them  What happened  But if you're going to plan this  Once again  A year to two years before  You got to  You got to have patience  Yeah  You are like the ideal husband  When the family comes over  It's nothing but love  Yeah  Everyone thinks you're the greatest guy  In the world  And then you start  You start planning your cruise  A couple years in advance  Everyone feels the excitement  As you get closer to the day 
[01:34:30]  But in your head  You're like  Oh boy  I'm going to be a free man soon  Yep  No one is going to be on to me  Getting tossed  You got to do your reconnaissance  For the boat though  You got to know  Where the cameras are  Things like that  Right  And off the balcony  Right  Speaking of cruise ships  You got to knock her out first  And then throw her over  So she's not screaming  Hell no man  Let her suffer  If you're going to do it  Let her suffer  Yeah let her watch that boat go away  Not even a drink in her  Depends I mean  When she hits that water  And sees that cruise ship 
[01:35:00]  Getting smaller and smaller  And the worst thing is  The water is pretty warm  Right  So you won't die of hypothermia  You'll just think of all the monsters  That are underneath you  Oh my god  And how far away from land you are  And how totally dead you are  Oh and you're just under the stars  Completely sober  Because if you're a little drunk  You might enjoy for a little while  Like oh my god  Wow what happened  Yeah  How are people falling off the ship  Why don't they just put like a big net  Around the bottom of the boat  That goes out like 10 feet  They have a lot of safety  Yeah most ships are hard to fall off 
[01:35:30]  You got to really wing a bitch off of there  You got to spin around  And really fling her  How awkward is it though  If you do grab your wife  And you go  You bitch  And you throw her off  And she lands in a protective net  And you don't know it  So the next thing you know  You're having cake  After your fake grieving  And they pull to the dock  And she's in the net going  What did you do that for  He threw me down here  I missed dinner  Alright I'll give you guys another one  Can I give you another one  Kevin from Connecticut  Goes oh same thing with the Grand Canyon 
[01:36:00]  Now I'm going to go with your Grand Canyon scenario  Kevin I've been out there  One of the greatest  People there  One of the greatest things  I've ever done in my life  Now the rim  You could do a little rim tour  Where you don't even go up  Into the canyon  Love a good rim tour  And you could get very close to the edge  Because the whole thing is  Get close to the edge  For the photo op  But what you got to do Kevin  In advance  You figure out  What area of the rim  Would be perfect for this  When  Then you give your wife  A little something something 
[01:36:30]  So she's getting a very good night's sleep  You go back out there  With a little hand shovel  And you kind of like  You know  Work the area a little bit  Yeah  Oh yeah  So then when she  You know  Backs up onto the  As close to the rim as possible  Next thing you know  Oopsie  I don't know  Nature just did its thing  And the rocks collapsed  Some gentleman  Recently  Within the past year or so  Tried this  Yeah  And got caught  How did he get caught?  He got caught  Said his wife  Got too close to the edge  And took a topple 
[01:37:00]  And fell off  And died  And again  I don't know how he got caught  But yeah  Because the ship  Hadn't left yet  They were on the dock  She was splayed out  On the dock  But it was the canyon  It was the Grand Canyon  That's a big ship  Jimmy  The ship didn't leave the canyon  That was what it was  Yeah  He said she fell off the ship  And it was the Grand Canyon  And a donkey  Stepped on her face  And he said 
[01:37:30]  He thought it was a clock  Oh no no  The Grand Canyon thing  I know what happened  He said that she fell  And they said  Well then why is your shoe print  In her back?  Yeah  Yeah it was probably  Something like that  I want to know  How the guy got caught  Some kind of a struggle  Because that seems like  A win-win  Yeah  Well maybe just a win  A win-win would be  She wins too  Getting away with it  Yeah I don't think she wins  A win-win in that case  It was a really big win for him  Yeah  Alright 
[01:38:00]  Try out  Yeah  If someone falls off  A cruise ship  It's usually murder  That's pretty much  The conclusion  We've drawn here  I think so  Well I mean  Nine out of ten  Murder  I'm sure there's  An accident that happens  There once in a while  But when you see  These stories  You're like  Come on  Yeah  Come on  Look at this  It's obvious  Who's falling off a boat?  Yeah  The railings are everywhere  It's not like  You know  You just fall off 
[01:38:30]  Like you're in a  Canoe  Why don't they  Give people this  Why doesn't every  Person on the ship  Always walk around  With that little  Lifesaver around them  Lifesaver  Is that what they call it?  Yeah  Life preserver  Lifesaver  They should walk around  With a mint  A tiny little mint  Around their midsection  Yeah  I'm tired  It's so funny  You know what they  Want to do  They want to give  Everybody a tracking device  Like a little thing 
[01:39:00]  Like you know  Big brother stuff  People don't like  The big brother stuff  No no  You hand it to them  GPS  It becomes a part of their  You just wear it  Like a necklace  Or something on you  So if God forbid  You do fall over  They'll know exactly  Where you fell  There's a way for them  To track you  Activated by salt water  Or yeah  Or there's a way for them  To track you  X amount of time  Then again  Whoever kills you  Will just take it off you  Yeah that's true  But if you fall off  And just throw it in the water  Another  You know  After the boat  Another half hour  That's a great point  Put it on this guy 
[01:39:30]  I'm chasing that  Son of a bitch  Around the ocean  Apparently your wife  Is chasing a killer whale  Around Antarctica  Did you realize  Your wife can swim  40 miles an hour  Yes  Oh well  Oh it's just a quick thought  I was watching  The Travel Channel  Like I said earlier  Just flipping around  Trying to find something  And this weekend  They were talking about  This cruise ship  Have you heard about this one 
[01:40:00]  It's a cruise ship  Where you can live on  Oh yeah  It's the latest rage  It's called  Buy like  It's almost like  Buying a condo  Yeah  On the water  It's like  It's called  What's the ship called  It's crazy  Amistad  And instead of like  Having 1,800 people  On this cruise ship  It can fit 1,800  It fits 300  Yeah  And they're all like  Multi-million dollar condos  Like Ant said  It doesn't look like  You know 
[01:40:30]  A room whatsoever  It looks like your home  Yeah  But you're on a cruise ship  And you're waking up  Every day  In another  You know  In another cool area  Of the world  Yeah  It goes all over the world  Yeah  Pretty cool  Here's the question  How much entertainment  Do you need  Really  I hope your house  Hits an iceberg  Hope you doze off  One night watching the news  Watching Sam Donaldson  And you wake up  Being attacked by  Some sort of sea animal  With an otter  Humping your face  Is it called the world  It's called the world  Yes  Oh 
[01:41:00]  And they figure out  Where they're going to go  According to what's happening  In the world  Yeah  So the Olympics  Okay  We're going to go  We're going to check out  The Olympics  The Cannes Film Festival  We'll be there for that  We'll go to Hawaii  We'll go here  That's crazy  And you just  Watch the world  Outside your window  If you're into that kind of thing  And they showed some of the rooms  And I mean the show itself  They could have done this  In ten minutes  The show was like an hour  I'm like  Okay I get it  But you know  Pretty amazing  Coffee shops  Yeah  Supermarkets 
[01:41:30]  And  There's a snobby crowd  Oh yeah  That's what I was telling my girl  I'm like  Could you imagine  Hanging with these  Bunch of old hirees  That have nothing better to do  With their millions  And millions  And millions of dollars  You and 300 of your neighbors  Seasick and vomiting  On each other  Someone vomited  On my million dollar balcony  You're making two more  It's been so successful  Yeah there's a waiting list  And everything  To get one of these things  What's the average  Condo  Let's call them condos  Go for them  It started at about  Two and a half million 
[01:42:00]  Goes up to 16 million  But you can also  Time share it out  Over 50 years  It works out to like  1500 a week  Wow  But very successful  And four seasons  Is getting involved  So they're going to be  Super luxury  It's a great concept  I wonder if they go back home  Just so you're  Not completely  Homesick  Slash seasick  You know what I mean  Yeah  Like do they go back to like  I don't know  Florida  Or wherever the F  It's from originally  Just so you can kind of  See your friends and family again  And then you go back  For another few months  On the water  Dude if you got that kind of money 
[01:42:30]  To buy like one of these  Wherever you go  You can just fly home  Hey let's fly home  From Barcelona  And then we'll catch it  Down in Sydney  And circle on up to Zimbabwe  There's a heliport  On the ship  And they can just  Land a helicopter  On there  And take you off  That's a language  Wow  We got primetime gossip  With Sam Roberts  As we go to break  We're back  And primetime gossip  Is here to report  On some late breaking news  Coming out 
[01:43:00]  Of the Opie and Anthony camp  When we last left  The Anthony half  Of O&A  He was falling apart  However  It seems that Cupid  Has re-entered  The shock jock's life  As was made evident  When Ann Coulter  Was recently interviewed  On the radio show  And you just come out  And go  Yeah  I said that  So  Wasn't it funny  Yeah  You're gonna laugh  At that one  Laughing a little too hard  Aren't we Mr. Cumia  Anthony went on  To throw his  Journalistic integrity  Out the window  As he furiously agreed 
[01:43:30]  With everything  Ms. Coulter  Had to say  Liberals want to  Censor opposing  Viewpoints  That is  God  That's a great point  Everyone on the show  Picked up on the vibe  And by the end  Of the interview  Anthony wasn't even  Bothering to hide it  Well  Anthony  Say goodbye  To your soulmate  We gotta take a break  I love her  Is love blossoming  Or is it just  One DJ's obsession  While no one  Has any actual information  We are reporting  That Ms. Coulter  Has been seen  Wearing Anthony's pin  Are the two  Going steady 
[01:44:00]  We say yes  And credit it to  Anthony's flattering  Descriptions of Anne  She's me with cans  Yeah  And brains  What could be next  For Coulthony  We may not know  But primetime gossip  Can guess  It will be Nazi themed  Stay tuned  As PTG continues  To deliver you  The goods  Opie and Anthony  What else is going on  Oh we forgot to mention  That Ricky Henderson 
[01:44:30]  Hall of Fame  That was an obvious one  But then they finally  Gave it to Jim Rice  His last year of eligibility  They said  Ah what the hell  I never knew  There was like  Only so many years  Yep  Why is that  How many years  Is it stunt brain  I mean Rice  Has been gone for  God it has to be  20 years right  Huh  I think it's a  15 year limit right  Yeah but  I was gonna go  15 years sure  You gotta make  You gotta get a certain  Amount of percentage  Of the vote  Every year  To stay on the ballot  And then you have 
[01:45:00]  15 years  And then  Why is that  Like I don't understand  Why is it 15 years  Yeah  What's the sense in it  Because sometimes  Sometimes there's  There's players  That obviously go in  Like Ricky Henderson  And then other years  There's nobody  Was he first ballot in  Oh yeah  Oh my gosh  Not even close  And then some years  There's nobody  So it kind of  Opens the door  For somebody  Who might be on the cusp  Of going in  Like Goose Gossage  Last year  How many home runs  Did Rice have  Did he break 500 
[01:45:30]  No  No no no  I think he had  300 something  300 so  What was his lifetime  Batting average  His stats were  Like right on the bubble  As far as  What they look at  And he shouldn't  Let him in  Screw it  He had good stats  For the late 70s  Early 80s  He was alright  He was a different era  They probably shouldn't  Have gave it to him  But they said  What the hell  They really don't  Have anyone else  I think is what  It comes down to  And they gotta  You know  It's a show  They want to put on  A show for everybody  So I think  They didn't have a choice  They needed to get  Somebody in there  That was sort of  Qualified  Right  Yeah because 
[01:46:00]  Aside from him  Like there was  Nobody else  Aside from him  Who else was up for  Andre Dawson  Nope  Don Mattingly  Nope  Don Mattingly  Nope  Mattingly was a  Come on  I think Mattingly's  A Hall of Famer  God no  He don't think so  He needed another year  Or two I'm thinking  Maybe  Donnie Baseball  Nope  Mark McGuire  Who got less votes  This year than he did  Last year  Oh boy that's that  Whole story  He saved baseball  I know  He saved baseball  You put him in for that  He only got like  22% of the votes  He needs 76  He'll never be in  Wow  They'll never put him in 
[01:46:30]  The guy did  Like that whole thing  Was  He saved baseball  After that  He is tainted  Well then what about  Roger Clemens  What's the thing with Roger  They're basically saying  This guy did steroids  They're getting braver  And braver with this  They're saying  The grand jury  Overwhelming evidence  That this guy  Did steroids  Well they're getting him  On lying  They're going to get him  Like they got  Clinton on perjury  Yeah  So if he lied  That's going to mean charges  And he's going to have to  Come up and testify again  How about that  Roger Clemens 
[01:47:00]  Never goes into the whole thing  Wow  How about that one  Nobody goes to prison  A few years go by  And they're like  Nope  They're going to do  The Mark McGuire thing  I think him and Bonds  Might be on the same year  I think they both  How funny  Both don't make it  How great would that be  So four years from now  We'll see what happens  How are you going to say  Even though I understand  The whole steroid thing  Yeah  But how can anyone say  That Bonds  Or Roger Clemens  Don't belong in the Hall of Fame  It'll be interesting  It's what we know 
[01:47:30]  You've got to put him in  It's what we know  You know  We watch those two players  I don't like Barry Bonds  Whatsoever  But you know  Come on  I mean goodness gracious  Yeah  Throw him in  What about Petey  When is Petey going in  Who  Pete Rose  Doesn't he have his own  Like Hall of Fame  Down the road  From Cooperstown  Or something  No he doesn't  Yes he does  Did he put himself  In his own Hall of Fame  Oh he's got  Come on look it up  I haven't thought about this  In years  But I guess  He was so fed up 
[01:48:00]  With baseball  He rented some space  Down the road  From the Hall of Fame  And he could go visit  Pete Rose  His memorial  Whatever  Wow  What a pompous ass  Every year  He goes to Cooperstown  During action weekend  Oh yeah  I like the fact  That he's such a  But then again  If he wasn't  Such an arrogant ass  He would have gotten in  If he would have  Showed some humility  And given baseball  Like you know  Like when two guys  Are ready to fist fight  A lot of times  They both kind of  Want a way to back out  Gracefully  Without totally losing  Their masculinity  If he would have 
[01:48:30]  Given baseball that  Instead of just  Bitting their face  And going  Nope I'm telling the truth  Nope I'm telling the truth  When everybody knew  He was lying  He left them  No wiggle room  So he was kind of  A douche about it  One day he'll get in  How though  If his eligibility's up  Because they'll  Reinstate him  First he's got to be  Reinstated into baseball  He's banned from baseball  And then  Once your eligibility's up  Then it's up to the  Veterans committee  To vote you in  You can still get in  After your eligibility  Do you think he'll get in  Imposthumously?  Yeah  It'll take a while  They should put his hair  In the Special Olympics  Hall of Fame 
[01:49:00]  Exactly  At least make it the logo  For the Special Olympics  That's right  Just his hair  You gotta let all  These guys in  All these  Mongloids just looking  At it with a tear  In their eye  The man who  Started it all  The Pete Rose  Oh god  They love the  Pete Rose do  They certainly do 
[01:49:30]  Pete Rose had a  Hall of Fame  On display  At the Cincinnati  Red Stadium  I heard something  About Cooperstown  He either rented  Space or he goes  Up there every year  And then you can  Go down the street  And say hi to Pete  Yeah when we went  I went  Two years ago  Maybe we can get  To the bottom of that  I went two years ago  And he was right down  The road  Signing autographs  Huge crowd  I'm gonna take  A little ride  Up to Cooperstown  You got money for it  Was he getting paid  Hell yeah  He charges per autograph  Of course 
[01:50:00]  He's got him  Is this the time  Of year to go up there  No one else is around  Right  Yeah I guess  If you wanna go up there  Now sure  It'll be freezing  It'll be a long drive  Why the hell  They put it up there  There's not one  Hall of Fame  I'd ever wanna go to  I gotta be honest  I went to Baseball  Hall of Fame  When I was a kid  I don't wanna go  To Cooperstown  That was pretty cool  Cause the history  Just goes so far  It doesn't matter  Though it's just like  To me it's like  The hard rock  With no burgers  Yeah  You're looking at what  Uniforms and bats  Bulls 
[01:50:30]  What are you looking at  What's the  What's the big thing  That I can't punch up  On the internet  And go  Oh there's the shirt  I remember the plaque  I remember the plaque room  Was like a waste of time  Cause it was just  Thousands of plaques  I think it's cool  You go you find  Your favorite players  And they say  Hey look  And then you take  Hey look  Then you take  A piece of paper  Oh do a rubbing  Do a rubbing  I just don't get  I got a rubbing  Of my favorite plaque  Hall of Fame thing  To me it's just  Boring  Like when everyone 
[01:51:00]  Went to the  Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  I was like  There's no way  I'm going there  That sucked  He cares about  I'm a big music guy  And that place  Sucked  There's one in New York  Now  Is there really  It's the  Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  Annex  It opened like  Last month  Downtown  They have better stuff  I don't know  I haven't been yet  But it's downtown  Instead of family members  Going into the attic  And going  Yeah Hendrix  Wore this once  Put this on display  The dummies  Will buy into it  That's what I saw  I'll go check it out  But it opened last month  Alright am I weird  For like 
[01:51:30]  Yes  Okay  We got that  Out of the way  Now what  See like  Going to the  Air and Space Museum  To me  Is like  Holy crap  That's cool  But is that  The same thing  As like  I actually went  With Anthony  One of those  Very rare occasions  That we hung out together  We were in D.C.  On a secret meeting  Going to XM  We had no choice  We had to hang out together  And the excitement  In your eyes  Yes I do remember  You were way  More into it  Than I was  But it was still 
[01:52:00]  Very cool  Yeah and things like that  Like you could actually  Go in  To some of these aircraft  And see  What it would have been like  To have been  In  You know those B-17s  Are a lot smaller  Than you think  And  Kind of get in there  And get a feeling for it  It's not like  Hey I'm going to put on  The babe's uniform  And swing his bat around  You're  You really like  The airplane thing  Why don't you get your license  I don't know  You're looking for new adventures 
[01:52:30]  He drives home in a truck  With a hand over one eye  You want him flying over  On Conklin  But he's so into it  You get the flight simulators  You go to the  You go to the  Air and Space Museum  You suck all this in  I know  You love it  Why wouldn't you just  Like take some lessons  When I was broke  I went on the  The Discovery  It's called  The Discovery Flight  Went down there to  MacArthur Airport  And hopped in 
[01:53:00]  A little Cessna 152  Go up with an instructor  And they let you  Take the controls  And you  It's the Discovery Flight  But then I said  Sorry  I'm broke  So I couldn't do anything  So why don't you do it now  I'd like to  At least take lessons  Yeah  Because you go to the  Gun range a lot  You know  Maybe get a couple more hobbies  And how fun it would be  To shoot out of a plane  Wow  Now you're talking  Some fun  Red Baron style  Sarah Palin style  It'd just be fantastic  Yeah  Alright 
[01:53:30]  So yeah  We're going around the horn here  So you got the Clemens thing  They're basically saying  Well  So excuse me  I do  My second favorite museum  Brought up on Palatog  Is of course  The Biff Tannen Museum  Which gives you  A whole history  Of Biff Tannen  And how he won  In sports  Betting  And got so much money  That he was able  To build the  Biff Tannen Museum  Ladies and gentlemen  Yes  Welcome to the  Biff Tannen Museum 
[01:54:00]  Yes  Dedicated to Hill Valley's  Number one citizen  Biff Tannen  America's greatest  Living folk hero  Biff Tannen  The one and only  Biff Tannen  Right  Of course  Of course  Inside you will learn  How Biff Tannen  Became one of the  Richest and most  Powerful men in America  Through betting  Learn the amazing  History of the  Tannen family  I want to invest  In Biff Co  Great grandfather  Biff Tannen  Biff Tannen  Fastest gun in the  West  Oh  Go watch  House of M  And how a trip  To the racetrack  On his 21st birthday 
[01:54:30]  Made him a millionaire  Overnight  Luckiest man in the world  Boo  I hate that movie now  What movie  I hate it  I think of it as a movie now  I completely agree  It's a way of life  I hate it  It's a way of life now  I understand  It's horrendous isn't it  Big DVD coming out  The trilogy will be coming out on DVD  With extras 
[01:55:00]  That will include  Michael J. Fox using a coloring book this week  It will include the ride  Yeah  That everyone remembers  From Universal Studios  The Back to the Future ride  All that footage  Which I believe  In my personal movie theater  Downstairs  Will be very interesting  In the front row  To watch that  On an 11 foot screen  That would be cool  Yes  I think that would be a lot of fun  You got to start flying  I'm thinking  At least take lessons 
[01:55:30]  That's right up your alley  My friend  I would like to do that  Maybe we could get some people out there  To help you figure out  How you get that done  At least go up a few times  And take the controls  Take Jimmy up there  Me and him could kiss  Can I tell you  It would be nice actually  You know with a man on a 727  A hickey at 30,000 feet  Yeah  With all the museums  They have in Washington  The one that blows  Is that Smithsonian  The Smithsonian  That thing is a piece of crap  It's old 
[01:56:00]  Huh?  You see Archie Bunker's chair  Or something like that  But then they got  Just a bunch of nonsense  It's 90% crap  It is right?  Isn't the air and space  Part of the Smithsonian wing?  It's part of the whole  Smithsonian block  Like there's  Complex  There's like a whole  Block of the Smithsonian  I would say  I really thought  I was going to see  A lot of cool stuff  At the Smithsonian  And that was a waste of time  Yeah  Yeah there really wasn't  That much  I like the Museum  Of Natural History  Here in New York City  That's a fine museum  Sure  Tiny sore bones 
[01:56:30]  Can't put McGuire in  His numbers are fake  Dinosaur  Look man  Stop with the goody two-shoe crap  Yeah his numbers are fake  Everyone  Not everyone  A lot of people in sports  Did what they had to  To you know  To get the real numbers  And survive in the game  Even though it was  Technically against the rules  And I know that  So yeah it's cheating  But like every era  In baseball  Had a lot of inconsistencies  For a long time  White players  Didn't face black players  Now I know they weren't cheating  And they were playing  By the same rules  As everyone else  I understand that  But when you look at it 
[01:57:00]  If you want to look at it  From a purest point of view  Like apparently that guy does  Babe Ruth  I think you know  Best slugger ever  But you know what  He never  There was a lot of black players  That were never in  So how do you put  Some of those white pitchers in  Jimmy the Greek Norton  No  Because see the black player  They were better than the white player  Well black pitching  Can we play that clip  Please get it  I haven't played that  In a year  I think that  A lot of black players  Might have changed the stats  Of some of these white pitchers  That are in  But you understand what I'm saying 
[01:57:30]  Are you going to tell me  A lot of the sluggers  That play now  Wouldn't have hit  Some of those white pitchers  But of course they would  So it's like all the stats  Are skewed to a certain degree  So you're right  This goody-to-do's crap  Is annoying  Now that all the steroid info  Is coming out  I've changed my tune  With Barry Bonds  Yeah  I hate the guy  But you know what  He's the home run leader  Most of his peers  Were doing the roids  And what are you going to do  It was the era of the steroids  In baseball  Yep  Just call it that 
[01:58:00]  You can look at every era  And there was something going on  Like Jimmy pointed out very nicely  You got that clip  I love this clip  The famous Jimmy the Greek  Jimmy the Greek  Committing career suicide  You didn't know man  That dumb guy  With a tape recorder  As he's just drinking and eating  And having a good time  Shoves the mic in front of his face  And this ended his career  The black is a better athlete  To begin with  Because he's been bred to be that way  Because of his high thighs  And big thighs 
[01:58:30]  That goes up into his back  And they can jump higher  And run faster  Because of their bigger thighs  This goes back all the way  To the Civil War  When during the slave trading  The big  The owner  The slave owner  Would breed  His big black  To his big woman  So that he could have  A big black kid  Probably a better way  To phrase that  Bye bye  Jimmy the Greek  That started  I bet if you did enough research 
[01:59:00]  You probably would find  That what he was saying  That was absolutely accurate  But  With that said  The way he said it  I know what Jimmy was ready to say too  That was the beginning  Of this whole  Yeah  Phony  Lose your job  Lose your job  Because of racial sensitivity  Thought policing  Garbage  Don't tell the truth  And then he also said this  Right  Yeah  They take over coaching  Like everybody wants them to  There's not going to be anything  Left for the white people  I mean all the players 
[01:59:30]  Are black  I mean the only thing  That the whites control  Is the coaching jobs  Now I'm not being derogatory  About it  But that's all that's left for them  You know what  He had to go  I changed my tune  And that tells you  What type of guy he is  Right there  Yeah that  That's beyond just  Trying to be factual  As he sees it  He was  Probably was  Speaking of black coaches  I had no idea  Until I just looked down here  Tony Dungy retired  When yesterday  The Colts  Head coach there  I heard that on the news  This morning  He was the one  That lost his son  Right  Yeah 
[02:00:00]  Did he  Oh yeah man  Was it a suicide  What was it  I don't remember now  Lost his  I think his son was like 18  Why does Travis  Have to  Can't we get you a mic in there  That you can just talk into  For a second  He's new  I think it was  I think it was an accidental death  I don't remember  But I know that he  Never recovered from that  Travis we're going to try  Something new with you  Okay  Jimmy he's right  You got two mics over there  A lot of times  They just sit there  You bring one of those  Into your nice booth  And if I need you  I'm going to plunk down  Your microphone 
[02:00:30]  Okay  Hoo hoo  You're going to be  In the new  Hoo hoo  Oh no  I want one of those  Because we know those work  I haven't touched that button  In four years  I don't know what the  Half that does  What is that  Yeah I'm scared  To touch new buttons  What Tim  I'm scared  Please  Huh  He has a mic in there  Please tell me  You're not bringing in  Another song parody  That we have to make  Believe we like  Speaking of  Oh my god  And then after the show  No you know  It was  It was alright 
[02:01:00]  It could have been better  You know  I'd have fake it  Before I forget  Oh now he's walking out  Oh Tim  Oh Tim  I can play your  Opie and Anthony theme song  We'd like that  Yes sir ma'am  Can I please say  That we did those  I did that live read before  Can I please say  If you call the stress factory  To roll your R's  Yes  No matter what you're saying  If you want to see Bob Kelly  Please go  I'd like tickets to see  Robert Kelly 
[02:01:30]  And then mention  That you love  The stress factory  Nice  He's so annoying  Into the answering machine  And you'd like to make  Reservations  Please do that  On Vinny's machine  Please  Only if you're calling  For legitimate business  Though  Quick break  We'll mop up  We go to break  With Tim's little  Cute Opie and Anthony  Theme song  Opie, I-E  That's Opie  With his partner  Aunt Bunny  They give us news 
[02:02:00]  In their own views  And Aunt really doesn't  Hate the Jews  Little Jimmy  Is also there  He likes females  And no one cares  Make me laugh  That's O-N-A  The pendulum is swinging  Back the other way  Make me laugh  Make me laugh  O-N-A  You've been listening to us  For four minutes  And you can't take it  You're a first time listener  Go screw  O-N-A 
[02:02:30]  Lingo longer.  Lingo longer.  Lingo longer.  Lingo long.  What?  That was lingo lingo.  That was my version of linger longer.  Sometimes it's just.  Oh, I would sit down and listen to this song right now. 
[02:03:00]  Well, this is not one of my favorite Aussies.  Nice.  Opie and Anthony.  Getting ready for a music marathon, huh?  Who's excited?  Woo!  Yeah!  Rocking the music marathon. 
[02:03:30]  We were talking about sports, and I forgot to mention something the Mets are doing.  Their patch.  Look it up for yourself.  Maybe we can link it on onaradio.com.  I'm embarrassed to be a Mets fan today.  It looks like the Domino's Pizza kind of logo patch thing.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  It is so cheap and cheesy looking.  It says inaugural season, and then the bottom third of the patch says 2009. 
[02:04:00]  That's it.  That's what you get.  It's amateur looking.  And then you look at the Yankees one.  That's pretty cool.  And it's nothing but class.  Yeah, I agree with you on that.  I agree with you.  And you know, the Mets moving into a new stadium and all that?  Change your colors.  Just go all in.  Completely new look.  Yeah.  New stadium.  New team, obviously.  They're doing a lot of trading.  People get a little crazy, though, with the changing of the uniforms and stuff. 
[02:04:30]  They get a little nutty.  Remember what happened with the logo on the Islanders?  Well, that's...  The Gorton's a Gloucester fisherman on the...  True.  That didn't last very long.  I don't understand what's going on with, like, sports merchandise, but I can't find  an Islander hat that I would wear.  Yeah.  An Islander t-shirt that I would wear.  I finally found one.  It's like a...  I don't wear it because we're the worst team in hockey.  No, I actually do.  I hang in there.  It's the old school Islander logo, and it looks like a very faded t-shirt, like you would 
[02:05:00]  have bought it 10, 15 years ago.  Yeah.  That's the best I could find.  Sports merchandise stinks.  Especially the Mets.  Like, I'll say one thing, and wow, this is going to be tough for some people to hear,  but the Boston Red Sox hat is cool.  The Yankee hat is cool.  Those are two teams I hate.  The Mets cap sucks.  I haven't been able to find a Mets hat I would wear.  They're for girls.  You look like a little...  You look like you're 12 years old as you walk around Manhattan trying to support your 
[02:05:30]  favorite team, and no one understands this in the organization.  That is so true.  You do look like a little kid.  Like, there's so many Red Sox hats in New York, and, you know, whether it's a chick or  dude, it looks cool.  It looks like, all right, look, he's supporting his team.  It's a good look.  Yankee, same thing.  Mets hat, every time you see one, you're like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  I've tried the black hat.  I've tried the old logo hat.  The old logo... 
[02:06:00]  The pink one?  No, I don't try the pink one.  I don't play for the pink team.  But, like, the Mets colors suck.  Their logo sucks.  Their hats are usually a little too small for your head to begin with.  What are they...  Why can't they figure that out?  I don't know.  If you've got the same people that are behind that patch...  Yeah, the patch is awful.  That explains it.  Awful.  All right, we've got a quickie before we start the music marathon.  I want to get this before 9 o'clock, because we, you know, we get credit right up until 
[02:06:30]  9.  Let the rest of the staff take care of the other hours.  CBS News in Chicago says, no such thing as a taint.  What?  Yeah.  Showdown over Barack Obama's Senate seat appears to be over tonight.  Roland Burris expects to be sworn in this week.  It's a stunning about face for Senate leaders.  Two weeks ago, they rejected him, saying the appointment, excuse me, was tainted.  CBS Tuesday, Dana Kozlov joins us with reaction to today's news. 
[02:07:00]  And then, Rob, Roland Burris was quick to say today that there's no such thing legally  as a taint.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Well, I object.  Back to you.  I object, Your Honor.  Legally, there is no taint?  Yeah.  How is that?  How is that news?  How do they say that and not know what a taint is? 
[02:07:30]  We should show that bitch where the taint is.  Yeah.  Word.  Show her that taint.  Fala.  Here's your taint.  Word to your mother.  All right.  We're out.  Yep.  We've got better things to do than hang out.  We'll break on through to the other side.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, I never got the catchphrase.  Phones were lit, but they didn't say that.  I give the phone calls a C- today.  Sorry, guys.  You're going to have to try harder. 
[02:08:00]  They were always commenting about there are abilities on any given day.  Well, guess what?  I put it back in your face.  Your participation sucked today.  C-.  That's what I give you.  What's the first song?  We don't even know what the first song is in the music marathon.  We should.  What's wrong with us?  What else are they doing on this station these days, their stump brain?  We're doing the lead lunch.  What the hell is a lead lunch?  I'm a lead zeppelin at lunch, and then we've got a lot of two-fers.  And Chris Booker's back in the afternoons. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  And it's, you know.  A lead lunch?  A lead lunch.  Is that an hour of zeppelin?  Oh, yeah.  And what's the other one?  Sounds a little heavy.  Some two-fers.  Let me get some two-fers in there.  We're doing two-fers.  Yeah.  Cool.  What's our first two-fer there, Fatso?  It's not a two-fer, but they're leading off with the live version of I Want You to Want Me by Cheap Trick.  Oh, my God.  I haven't heard that song in yesterday.  Hey.  Now?  That's a lot of people tune that in. 
[02:09:00]  It's a guilty pleasure.  Sure is it.  You hear it, and you go, oh.  That's actually something that wouldn't annoy me to hear that on the radio.  It's like, yeah, I like it.  You know, what annoyed me is a lot of the newer stuff annoyed me.  That I can listen to.  What about a little Dream Police?  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  The Boo Police.  Remember you said that, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  I was in a car coming from the airport, and you went, the Boo Police.  The Boo Police.  You yelled out for booing.  It was just so stupid.  It made me really laugh in Lincoln Tunnel Traffic. 
[02:09:30]  Kenny, remember that?  Yes, sir.  Liar.  All right, the Music Marathon starts with the Cheap Trick.  Cheap Trick.  Bye, everybody.  See you tomorrow.  Is this us?  Yes, it is.  Got a nice crowd.  Is that you, John Wayne?  Got a nice crowd on the sidewalk.  Yeah?  I just walked by a bunch of listeners.  They're still not up here for whatever reason.  Because Poe's gone. 
[02:10:00]  Poe's not in today.  Yeah.  Yarr.  A lot of people called in sick today.  No Danny, no Steve, no Poe, no Travis.  Oh, hi, Travis.  I even forgot Steve wasn't here.  I'm not shitting on Steve.  I just forgot.  I spoke to the Danny I see in the studio.  I knew Danny wasn't here.  Yes.  Steve has some kind of imaginary cold he's been fighting for.  Am I wrong?  No.  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Some weird imaginary cold.  He goes, I'm going to finally, like, take care of this cold.  So I'm going to take today off.  I'm like, what cold?  No one even knew you had a cold.  Believe me, he's having the same conversation that Jenny Gump had to have with Forrest on the fucking...  He's got just bizarre ailments that you don't really see.  My asshole's coughing and spitting out bleachy white stuff.  Maybe he's taking care of his sweaty forehead, finally. 
[02:11:00]  Having a swab down with a penis.  Boy does know how to sweat, doesn't he?  He sure does, Anthony.  He sure does.  What are we doing on the XM portion of the show today?  What do you guys want to do?  I think an equal mix of hijinks, shenanigans, chicanery.  Nuttiness?  Nuttiness.  Racism, sexism, homophobia.  No, let's get...  The gay thing.  Let's get away from that for a moment.  What?  Let's try... 
[02:11:30]  I know we'll be out of our comfort zone, but let's try to do less gay.  Less gay?  Just for a little while.  I don't know how you do that.  I know it's the go-to thing.  Certainly.  Out of our comfort zone.  Yuck.  Play some music, maybe, I guess.  I don't know.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Music marathon?  I could turn some people on to some music today.  Marathon.  What do I like lately?  Man, I've been listening to some trippy stuff.  That goddamn liquid Todd, man, has turned me on to some weird shit.  That's zeros and ones. 
[02:12:00]  I like liquid ass.  Well...  We're going to be doing some more liquid ass pranks in the very near future.  I never want to smell that again.  What is that, Jimmy?  My new BlackBerry.  Boy, that thing really blasts.  That's fucking amazing.  My little iPhone doesn't have a good speaker.  No, and one of them is on the fritz.  I'm a big fan of the BlackBerry, but I have not made the move to get the one Jimmy's got yet.  I have another number that I had.  And so far, I just got it yesterday.  I don't know if I'll keep it, but so far, there's a few things the iPhone is certainly better at, 
[02:12:30]  but I'm actually kind of digging it.  Like, I don't like the keyboard as much on the BlackBerry,  and the little things that the iPhone is so used to,  and you can, like, spread your fingers apart and open and make it bigger.  Yes, that I like.  I like that a lot, too.  Let's start an over-under.  Jimmy hates his BlackBerry by what days today?  Well, no, the iPhone blew my sink yesterday.  I fucking lost everything since I remember.  By Friday, you're going to find something you hate about that phone  to the point where you want to break it.  I probably will.  But I'm telling you something.  This is your third phone this week alone.  The other one I brought back the next day? 
[02:13:00]  Uh, I just, I don't know.  How many phones have you had in a year?  A lot.  He's, it's, you can't even keep track.  I've had two, and the only reason I've had two is because the other one was in my pocket  when some dummy pushed me in the pool.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then this, I got this one.  That's not bad, though.  That's the iPhone.  Yeah, that's not bad either.  That's not bad.  I guess mine is bad because only one little speaker works on the bottom. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, but you throw the headphones in and then you're, you're really, you're just rocking.  You're golden as I would ask.  All right, Blue Healer from Kentucky says, listen to Sad Man's Tongue from Volbeat.  Is that how you say that band's name?  Travis is more hip, way more hip than I am.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  Yeah, he knows his shit.  Volbeat.  V-O-L-B-E-A-T.  How do you say that?  He's an age beard.  Give me a little Sad Man's Tongue.  You're looking.  What?  Sad Man's Tongue?  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  It's the name of the song by Volbeat.  V-O-L-B-E-A-T.  All righty.  If Sirius XM isn't playing it, then it's, it's not worth my time.  Attaboy.  Not worth, not in here.  Song has to blow.  Thank you.  That's what I say.  See, I'm a company man.  Uh, let's go to James in Jersey.  James.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, Jimmy.  Oh.  I just got that liquid ass shit yesterday.  Yep.  Oh my God.  I opened up the box and it's like, like, I see that they sprayed it before they sent it 
[02:14:30]  or one of them exploded in the bag.  And, but I got a big lift of shit when I opened it up.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  And that, that fucking liquid ass company could, could suck a dick.  They spent, I think, $10 on advertising on this channel.  And you know how much product we sold already?  Yeah.  For these fuck nuts?  Is that all they did?  Like, they just came on real quick?  I'm not going to say who told me, Will.  But he said, you know, they bought a very, very small schedule.  They sell them too much time. 
[02:15:00]  Stink liquid.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's perfect for our audience.  You know, they're buying stink liquid out the ass right now.  Mm-hmm.  It smoked, it smoked great when I went to a convenience store.  Yeah.  Everybody ran away from the ATM.  They didn't use it the whole day.  Yeah.  You know what?  I, I got something.  Uh, I think, I don't, we don't feel like doing the radio show today.  What?  So, guess what?  You guys do the show today.  Who, the, the listeners?  Uh, yeah, we got stuff we can go to, but let them, let them develop the show right in front 
[02:15:30]  of their eyes.  That sounds like fun.  Ooh.  And then we get involved, like, listeners?  Well, if it's something we could, like, really get into, then we're like, okay, we'll do that  for a little while.  Don't suggest old bits, like stuff that is happening right now.  Start a discussion.  What's on your mind this afternoon?  Uh, well, we can start with this.  Thank you, sir.  So, his liquid ass is leaking in, uh, in the packaging. 
[02:16:00]  Ew.  In his mailbox.  Sure the mailman loved delivering that one.  Yeah.  I'm going to start with this one.  We got a guy.  He writes, uh, well, he doesn't write, because it, okay.  Dear Casey.  Marcel in Rhode Island, you guys should watch the video of the show, Dirty Jobs.  We love Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe.  Yeah.  A guy castrates a sheep with his teeth.  Fucking unbelievable.  No, he doesn't.  So, let's try to find that, and maybe that's...  Can't be true.  Maybe that's the direction the show goes in today. 
[02:16:30]  Let's see what we can develop in front of everybody's eyes today.  That can't be true.  We're starting with a blank canvas, Anthony.  It's freaking me out just thinking about it.  What does he do?  Does he use a knife first, and then just cut the wires with his teeth?  Or does he bite the scrot off?  I don't know.  And let the balls drop out?  I watched the horse be castrated.  Why would you watch that?  Jimmy Jackson.  Because Jimmy Jackson used to do it.  Yeah.  What do they do?  Jimmy Jackson used to do it. 
[02:17:00]  He, uh...  Is that taking the ballies out?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  He would just take a horse, um, like, tie up its front legs and push him over.  Yeah.  And he would just, like, you know, push over.  And then he would tie the rear leg, the rear hoof, or paw, to the front legs, and then  take a buck knife, regular knife, and cut the bottom of the scrotum off.  Did they like that? 
[02:17:30]  They hated it.  Really?  And then the balls pop right out.  Because some of these dumb animals, you do all those horrific things to it, and they're  just, they're just eating grass.  No, the thing's like, wah, he's making noises.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then the balls pop out, and then you cut whatever's connecting the balls to everything  inside.  And then he took a big thing of, um...  All right, we found the video, but...  Holy shit.  Then he'd take a big thing of pine tar.  Right.  And slap it on the wound.  And that's it?  No stitches, no nothing. 
[02:18:00]  Just pine tar.  But does the pine tar go away, and then the...  Yeah, then eventually the pine tar wears off as it heals from the inside out, and it just  has no balls no more.  Huh.  Wow, I think I just saw a little piece of that footage of the guy castrating the, um...  Today, this is your radio show.  Where are we going?  We're going to start with this.  So you got Dirty Jobs.  You got Mike Rowe.  Now, Mike Rowe's a pussy.  Why isn't he doing this?  Would you do this for the good TV, Ant? 
[02:18:30]  If they said it was safe, and you weren't going to get any diseases?  Wait, wait, wait, what?  He's castrated.  What'd he just do?  That's fucking horrible, man.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Get the audio on.  What?  Thank you, whoever...  And now he's shoving his thumb up his ass.  This guy has a sexual problem with sheep.  Get over here.  Yeah, let's start this later on.  What fucking animal to do that to an animal, that motherfucker?  Maybe it doesn't hurt.  Maybe it's the way they do it.  I love when people say, it doesn't hurt the animal.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[02:19:00]  Try.  Here we go.  Dirty Jobs.  No letter kick.  I imagine it might want to kick you.  All right, Mike Rowe is holding the sheep.  That's the stroke.  How old is this?  How old is this land?  He's probably close to three weeks.  Die.  Those are the testicles.  Those are the testicles.  You get in here and you squeeze them out.  Oh, my God.  What the hell are you doing, man?  What in the name of all the...  Oh, my God.  Pull the testicles out.  And then he takes the testicles out with his teeth.  Yeah, that's fucking...  I'm procrastinated to make sure that only sheep with desirable wool or bread, healthy males 
[02:19:30]  with the right coloring, are left intact.  Fucking...  Get over here.  What happened?  That's docking, for real?  This, the docking is actually the cutting of the tail.  Yeah.  And that's...  What the...  God damn, that's...  Okay, now go ahead and flip him and kind of up.  Sit him on his tail.  That way it'll kind of...  Like this?  Cut the bleeding off.  That fucking poor animal.  And then while you do that...  What?  That's hell! 
[02:20:00]  I do the earmark.  Right.  Kick out.  We're going to go ahead and set him back inside.  Just put him back down?  Man, we deserve everything that's coming for us.  We really do.  Whether it's fucking nuclear disaster, volcanoes...  We so deserve it.  Global warming, alien invasion...  When it finally fucking happens, the animals are going to be like, about fucking time.  What we do to animals...  And I'm not even...  I swear I'm not an animal guy.  Dude, he pulled the fucking testicles out with his teeth.  But they wouldn't show this on TV unless it's a very normal practice that probably doesn't 
[02:20:30]  hurt the animal that much.  I would guess.  No, no.  That fucking animal is in agony when it's getting blown bitten off.  It's just such common practice that it's accepted.  Now they're branding them.  This is just...  Can we get Mike Rowe on the phone?  Biting the testicles.  Because the fucking wool isn't the right color.  And you know what, man?  Fucking...  As much as PETA can be annoying...  They are.  Yeah.  But there is a purpose to them.  And it's like... 
[02:21:00]  They would fucking be on this guy so fucking badly.  They would make the company not allow this dirtbag to bite an animal's balls off because  it's wool isn't that color.  Yeah, but the thing...  You know what your fucking wool sweater is going to cost you?  And the fuck wool it itches?  You know what your wool fucking whatever you wear is going to cost you?  Well, you know what?  If we have to pay an extra fucking quarter so that an animal's fucking balls aren't bitten  off, then I don't know.  Are we that fucked up?  Do we need a wool sweater that bad?  Holy shit, are we a fucking bunch of cunts.  I'm not angry yet because I really want to... 
[02:21:30]  Maybe someone can help us out with this.  Maybe the fucking sheep doesn't feel it.  Like, do you know what it would take to anesthetize every fucking sheep they got to castrate?  The money and time that it would take when you could just bite their balls right off?  Fair enough, but then we wonder, like, how terrible?  How could someone run into a fucking innocent civilian yelling Allah Akbar with a fucking  bomb strapped to them?  And I'm not saying that that's the same thing, but it is the same complete indifference to 
[02:22:00]  something else.  Well, they don't have the divine spark of life that we have.  Exactly.  They can't go to heaven.  Do you know what I mean, though?  They don't get to go to heaven.  Only we do.  It's different, but it's the same part of the brain working.  It is the same absolute indifference to the suffering of something else, needlessly.  It is really odd that people can do that.  And yet, as Americans, we sit around and go, ah, how can anybody behave that way?  Oh, look, hold his legs open and bite his fucking balls off. 
[02:22:30]  We like the payoff to other people doing our dirty work.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  I love a good steak.  I don't want to shoot a bolt through the poor little guy's head.  I agree.  You know, I might not like wool sweaters.  Some people do.  A nice Van Heusen sometimes.  They're not wool, though.  They were, what is it?  Rayon.  Rayon.  Dacron.  Polyester.  Shite.  Shite.  Is there a worse brand?  No, it's the awful.  They were actually a collection of bitten-off sheep testicles. 
[02:23:00]  What you'd wear.  It's like mole hair.  Yeah, but if they, oh, I didn't put the audio on.  What a bastard I am.  Well, Mike Rowe bit the testicles in this same episode.  No, he didn't.  And I would imagine he wouldn't be risking his career so that someone had to say something  that, look, this is normal practice.  No, he didn't.  They would not allow this on Dirty Jobs unless they did a lot of research and found out that  this is certainly okay in the sheep community. 
[02:23:30]  Holy shit.  I can't even watch it.  It's like fucking.  Steve's not answering his phone.  He should still be producing the fucking radio show from his fucking house.  No, he's not going to do this.  Especially if he has a fucking cold.  You give them.  Look at the animal.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kicking.  Look at the fucking animal struggling to get out.  He's like, you just bit my fucking balls off.  He looked.  He's making a face like you just bit my balls off.  And they cut the tail off too?  Yeah.  It's a legitimate job.  Like, that's why he's allowed to do it.  Right.  Like a slaughterhouse. 
[02:24:00]  But the animal's fucking.  How do you do that to a fucking animal, man?  He ain't being slaughtered.  He gets to run around after this is done.  Walk around.  How fast is he running?  His ball is.  And they cut the tip of his ear off.  They're cutting his tail off.  Look at this fucking, look at this leather-faced fucking Texas Chainsaw Massacre nutty motherfucker.  The guy's got blood all over his fucking clothes.  I think this guy loves what he does.  Fuck.  We're just a fucking sickening.  And it's not just a man. 
[02:24:30]  It's all people.  We're just fucking sickening because there are things that we could do gentler and we don't.  Jimmy Crisco has a little problem with what you said.  Of course he does.  Why wouldn't he?  It's a shake.  Crisco from Whackbag.  A regular.  There's a huge fucking difference, Jimmy.  We're killing sheep for wool sweaters.  They're killing people because they don't agree with their way of life.  Now with Crisco, who's obviously-  We're not mass slaughtering sheep because we disagree with their politics.  Holy shit.  No, stupid fucking Crisco.  What I said was, you idiot, what I said was, you idiot, that it is a difference. 
[02:25:00]  I said it was different, but it's the same part of the brain, which is a complete indifference to something else, to something that is fucking barbaric.  It's the same part of the fucking brain, and I certainly don't agree with Islam, but hey, you want to fucking play that game, what's a fucking higher ethic?  Like, killing yourself and somebody else for whatever crazy God reason you have, or because you want a nicer sweater, biting the fucking balls off of something that is innocent and defenseless. 
[02:25:30]  I don't even disagree with it that it's different, but it's like, don't get into that fucking self-righteous game, stupid.  Wow.  Yeah, I hear what Jimmy's saying.  It's like the same type of-  The same side of the brain, man.  Like, I couldn't do this.  I couldn't fucking do this job.  Wow.  God damn it.  You got to check out this video out there in radio land.  What the fuck?  And this should make-  Fuck.  This should make Jimmy very happy.  At the end of the episode, they fried up the testicles and ate him. 
[02:26:00]  But it's like, what a fucking scumbag way to do it.  Yeah.  What a scumbag way to do it, man.  Well, why do they do it?  No one has answered the question yet.  Because they don't give a fuck.  It's probably-  So they don't reproduce for the wool is better.  But they probably have a, in their work, you know, in their minds, a legit reason why they do it this way.  I just want to know.  What are they saying?  Why are they cutting it off with a knife?  Who saw the episode?  I don't know.  Because it's probably the easiest way to do it without any tools. 
[02:26:30]  One person holds it.  The other person squeezes with his hands.  So they both got their hands full.  So you'd need a third person if you wanted to do it surgically.  No one makes me laugh is comments like this.  Boys, it's a radio show.  We can't see this.  Holy shit.  Do you have a fucking computer, you 1970 cunt?  Or do you have an imagination? 
[02:27:00]  Let's start there.  You can imagine what we're talking about.  A sheep is being held.  They put a little slit.  And then they pull the fucking testicles out by their teeth.  That's good radio, my friends.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't actually need to see the video.  And guess what?  With the new technology today, now you might go, you know what?  I'm going to make a note, and I've got to now see that video because of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Work with us.  We're multitasking here.  It's fucking radio.  So we describe what we're seeing. 
[02:27:30]  Mm-hmm.  What are you supposed to do?  That's what radio's been for years.  Okay.  Dummy.  You should have your balls bitten off.  All right.  We got...  No, the dad should have, so we'd have to deal with this.  Now we got some answers to the questions we're asking.  Let's go with Jay in Virginia.  Jay?  The reason they back the testicles off is because it's a rougher wound.  It causes less bleeding than a clean cut.  So it bleeds less, which causes less pain from the animal.  But they do it as a regular practice.  But there is an easier way nowadays. 
[02:28:00]  They've got what's called banding.  It's very smart, but very thick rubber band.  They pull both testicles out, stretch the rubber band over, and that cuts the blood circulation off, which causes them to rot off instead of cut off.  I think they're showboating a little bit.  I completely agree.  I'm sure after the slit, they can probably maybe take something that...  Some prongs or something and take the testicles out.  But they're like, look what we can do with our teeth.  Same thing as the...  Yeah.  What are they called?  The fucking...  The fucking... 
[02:28:30]  The fucking...  Forceps?  The fucking...  The fucking...  It sounds like thong sounds...  Tongues.  Tongues.  Tongues.  It's fucking human beings' pathetic attempt at being real fucking hunter animals.  Arr.  Be gritty with my teeth.  Arr.  We're fucking soft-skinned faggots who need guns to be...  Or elephants would step on us.  It's okay that we have to do that to protect ourselves.  But don't try to get gritty by biting off a sheep's fucking balls.  You love my guns? 
[02:29:00]  No, I don't mean...  I like that.  I'm talking about, like, to defend ourselves against animals.  What the hell's happening out there?  What happened?  All of a sudden they started jockeying around.  Let's say hi to Brian.  How about they do it to a fucking lion?  Or how about a wasp?  How about you pick up a hornet and bite his balls off, you fucking faggot?  A sheep.  Gotta have the guy hold it so it's little sheep legs.  At least hold it down yourself.  You fucking puss.  All right, we got a guy that does this for a living.  I've castrated a sheep before.  Brian, give us some knowledge, will you? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, I haven't.  I don't do it now, but I have done it when I was a kid.  And the reason they do that is because it's a lot faster.  They just cut the top off, squeeze the balls, pull them out with their teeth,  throw a little medicine on there, flip them over, cut the tail off,  and on to the next one.  But they don't use their teeth, they use their lips.  They pull their lips over the teeth and pull it out very gently.  If they bite them, it hurts a lamb a lot.  They just yank them right out.  Dude, why do they cut the tail off? 
[02:30:00]  They cut the tail off because their tail and their balls take protein to grow,  so if they take the tail and the balls off, the lambs actually grow more meat.  Oh, good.  Good.  I love how we figured this shit out.  They take the tails off so they grow more meat.  You will tell me when you stop biting those lambs' balls off, won't you, Brian?  They don't bite the tail and cut the tail,  but actually the ones that are going to keep the cut the tails off right up next to the skin so they can breathe. 
[02:30:30]  If the tail's in the way, they can't breathe.  The ones that keep the cut right off next to the lambs.  Fucking scumbag industry.  Holy shit, do I hate people.  I know it's the listener's show today.  We're just going wherever they take us,  but I just have to break out of this for two seconds to say Hillary Clinton is doing her confirmation hearing,  and that pussy whipped Chuck Schumer.  Why is he sitting right next to her during this whole thing?  Because he is her fucking lapdog. 
[02:31:00]  He has been for years.  Is there any reason he has to be there?  Except for showing support.  Yeah, showing support.  Is that it?  I would gather.  What else is he going to do?  Huh.  Oh.  All right, but it's not our show today.  It's the listener's show.  Let's go with Brian in Delaware.  Brian?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, thanks, Brian.  Hey, man, the Liquid Ass gimmick, it works wonders in a nightclub when you got some, like,  Justin Timberlake guy, you know, trying to take all the women. 
[02:31:30]  You walk up behind him, you score a couple drops on the back of a pant leg.  Oh.  It really works nice.  I mean, it'll clean the house real quick.  But I was going to ask y'all, why support Liquid Ass when they've been supporting Bubba for three years?  He's been advertising for three years with them.  That's why they aren't getting the money.  Hey, I don't care if Bubba is...  Actually, that's where they designed the smell from, his seat.  It's the liquefied audio of his show.  What? 
[02:32:00]  Punch it out.  You know, you want to talk about that fucking loser hillbilly, go to his fucking website and see how he did blind boxing recently.  Yeah, nice one.  And why don't you go ask that fucking redneck hillbilly where he got that idea from, cocksucker.  Well, it seems...  We did blind boxing before we did.  No one.  Go fuck yourself.  Hillary's going to catch a little problem because of Bill.  What do you mean?  Well, that's the only flack. 
[02:32:30]  Well, Bill Clinton, in certain ways, he's made money and things like that.  But they say she'll skate through.  Really?  I don't know any...  I don't know any...  Bill Clinton...  I don't know...  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Yeah, there were a lot of buffers.  She'll skate.  Listen, here we go.  Jimmy... 
[02:33:00]  Jimmy, you're getting fucking tedious.  Stop eating meat, then.  Just because you admit your hypocrisy doesn't make you less annoying.  I don't care.  Whoever the listener is...  That would be TJ Joseph from ICANN.  Well, you know what, TJ?  You got an option.  Fucking keep listening to it, stupid.  Because I'll say whatever I want.  And then, uh...  Pete from Jersey.  Jimmy, stop crying about the animals.  Their food.  Their clothing.  Not people.  Cry for people.  Animals would eat...  Ah, shut the fuck up. 
[02:33:30]  Animals would eat your guts while you're still alive without a what-up.  Yeah, but they wouldn't bite my balls off and fucking eat my tailbone off to fatten me up.  Fucking...  And bite my ear off.  Dumb motherfuckers.  I don't care if people agree.  You can write in all the stupid instant feedback you want.  I don't...  I'm not saying this for people to agree with me.  I don't give a shit.  What's the matter?  You don't like to look at the fucking...  You don't like to look at how fucking close to home...  What's the matter? 
[02:34:00]  It makes you realize that you don't have as much right to complain about when other people are pieces of shit towards other people?  Because you see how we act?  I couldn't do that to a little lamb.  But, uh...  I'll eat a fucking lamb chop in a second.  Those are some tasty fucking...  Oh, God.  I love lamb chops.  Oh!  They are delicious.  Oh, you ever have a little rack of lamb?  Oh, the rack of lamb.  They take them ribs and they put the little things on top of them and put them in a circle. 
[02:34:30]  And then you just...  Oh, it's so good.  Fuck them and their balls.  I was looking at...  I was looking at my steak the other night.  I was like, man, I don't want to know what part of the body it came from.  Because they make it look so appetizing, right?  Yeah.  They should make a law that they have to serve food with the head still attached.  And then we'll see...  No matter what it is.  No matter what it is.  Even if it's a little piece of steak, it's got a giant fucking steer head on it.  And then we'll see how many meat eaters are still out there.  Put the fucking... 
[02:35:00]  Well, let's just put the face, not even the head, the face of the thing you're eating on  the plate.  Oh, that wouldn't bother me at all.  It wouldn't bother you?  It's delicious.  When they fucking...  They put out the whole fish for you and you see the fish head and...  Especially fish.  Who cares about that?  I don't care as much about that.  You're right.  Are you going to get all upset when you're eating a scallop that you're looking at a  shell on a plate?  But just imagine if they put the little cow face on your plate and try to enjoy your steak.  Stupid thing sticking its tongue up its nostril, sucking snot out of there.  Good for them.  The chicken head with the eyes just frozen in time as you're trying to enjoy some chicken 
[02:35:30]  breast.  All right.  Chicken heads are pretty disgusting.  What other heads would just drive you nuts?  What other heads we got?  What other ones?  What's a good one?  In fucking Chinatown when they just hang the chickens up like that.  Unbelievable, right?  The head's still on, the beaks.  It's amazing.  It cut off...  Best part!  Really?  You cut a couple parts off the chicken and now it looks like it's...  Everything's fine.  It's edible.  Everything's fine.  It's just food.  Don't have the little chicken feet still attached or nothing. 
[02:36:00]  You don't want anything that makes it look like a thing that was alive.  Huh?  That had stuff that made it walk.  I guess you have to eliminate every bit of what gave it locomotion.  Yeah.  Get rid of its wings.  Mm-hmm.  Get rid of its fucking feet.  Mm-hmm.  The head.  You know, and then you just got the torso.  Yeah.  That's it.  Hang that up.  Could you eat meat and stuff if the face or the head was... 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  It wouldn't bother me.  Really?  I wouldn't want the fucking, like, fuzzy, rotting steer head near me.  But if it's...  I've been to...  You've been to these dumb restaurant, theme restaurants where they got big fucking steer  head on the wall.  Yeah.  With the big horns.  That's easy.  And then you're eating.  Yeah, that's easy.  You're looking at the fucking thing.  Dude, I went back to that place where you ordered the five-pound lobster because you  were pissed off at our agent.  I finally went back there.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And they brought me a whole fish.  And then the guy is cutting it up for me and he goes, you got to try the eye. 
[02:37:00]  It's the best part.  No, it's not.  No, not the eye.  I'm sorry.  The cheek of this sort of fish.  The fish cheek.  How do you know a fish has a cheek?  Did you pinch it?  No, you...  He called it the fish cheek and he says it's the best part of the fish.  It was disgusting.  Of course it was.  I had to try it, but it was disgusting.  It's like, what the fuck?  I ain't eating fish cheeks.  No, thank you.  More on the castration of the sheep.  It's the listener show.  Aunt Earl Flynn used to castrate animals. 
[02:37:30]  Used to watch any of these interests.  You just let me know.  Used to watch sheep get castrated as a kid.  I think we kind of did that.  If you don't want bad wool and sheep mating, build a fence.  I like this idea.  Alex in Philly.  Yo, first time long?  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, James.  Thank you, man.  If they want to keep the wool pure, why don't they just build a fucking fence?  That would kind of solve everything, right?  No, that would be very not cost effective because you'd have to put a fence in. 
[02:38:00]  You got to keep them separated.  What, are you going to have separate fucking places for them when they're eating and everything?  Fuck that.  Too expensive.  Bite their balls off.  Let's say hi to Arch on Long Island.  Arch.  What do you say, guys?  Hey.  How many people to this day still do not eat veal because of that City Slickers movie,  Billy Crisler, with that little calf named Norman?  I don't eat veal once I've found out what they do to get it. 
[02:38:30]  It's just a personal choice.  I don't eat it.  Oh, man, what they do to chickens isn't much better.  I'm not saying, you know, again, yeah.  I just don't eat veal because I never got into veal.  It's the only reason.  Oh, veal.  You like the veal, right, Ant?  I like veal marsala.  Oh, what's that?  You eat Norman?  I could give a fucking shit.  It doesn't bother me.  Like I said, if we weren't top of the food chain.  Yeah, love eating Norman. 
[02:39:00]  You know, something comes down here and decides we're tasty, and we're fucked.  To serve man.  It's a cookbook.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Holly in St. Petersburg.  It's the listener's show today.  We just sit back.  We've got plenty of stuff to go to, but you know what?  We'll try this out today.  Holly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I have a first-time caller.  Thank you, Holly.  But I wanted to say that this animal talk and everything, last night I watched the show, 
[02:39:30]  and it was so disturbing that I survived on the Biography Channel, and these old people  were hiking in the woods, and this mountain lion attacked the guy, and he's, like, telling  his wife to take the ballpoint pen out of his back pocket and stab it in the eye.  And they live, but the thing, like, ripped the guy's head off.  The guy died?  No, he lived.  She dragged him up to the road, and she was trying to flag somebody down.  And, like, the first guy that she tried to flag down drove around her and sped off. 
[02:40:00]  And then the second time, oh, these workers came.  And it was like, I mean, she looked like she was, like, your mom, and she was just, like,  so scared.  And she says, and I had to poke the mountain lion in the eye with this ballpoint pen.  You know, that tests your love.  I know a lot of us out there say to our spouse, I love you more than anything.  What is the more than anything part?  Like, if a mountain lion is attacking your wife, are you going to hang out and try to  save her, or are you running and saying, well, I guess the love wasn't that strong after  all?  You should say I love you more than a lot of things. 
[02:40:30]  But everyone says I love you more than anything.  Many, many things.  But the more than anything has never really been tested.  No.  I love you more than a bevy of things.  Like, that is, I love you more than anything, hanging around, getting the ballpoint fucking  pen out, and poking the mountain lion in the eye.  Well, if you remember, a chimpanzee guy who got his balls ripped off by a chimp's teeth.  Yeah.  See, look at that guy.  He got his fucking balls ripped off. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  He didn't like it.  And they said the problem is they would try to wear a fat man's sweater.  And exactly.  Look at how we react to that.  It's funny.  Look at how we react to that.  We go, oh, because they should shoot those chimps.  Yeah.  All they wanted was some birthday cupcakes.  Fat boy and thumbless wife didn't want to give the chimps cupcakes.  So the chimps were like, you're going to give cupcakes up.  And now you lose your nose and balls.  I'm a big fan.  Full face.  Your balls.  I'm one of your feeties.  I'm a big fan when animals fight back and get the best of us. 
[02:41:30]  I love those videos more than anything.  But that's a great.  I love it.  Well, that woman, she jumped in.  Yeah.  To try to help out the hubby.  So, you know, I guess.  I love you more than anything.  That's a ballsy fucking move.  That's an I love you more than anything.  Yeah.  Bitter thumb off.  It cost her a title.  She had an eight-year run as best Fonzie impressionist, and she lost because it was two days before  the competition, and she had to stay in the hospital thumbless.  She could only hitchhike northbound. 
[02:42:00]  But, yeah, it's amazing.  Like, that one example of animals ripping off human balls, and that was front-page news.  Crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's your show today.  Where are we going next?  We'll find out after we hear from what.  What are they playing right now?  Does it matter?  Same promos over and over and over again.  Oh, my God.  In between our show and Ron and Fez, it's unlistenable to Steve, who runs the channel. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  There should be something there.  To Steve, who runs the channel, it's unlistenable.  Yeah, it's just promo after promo.  Promo after promo after promo.  And then it's the promos that they started the break with again.  It is unlistenable that they can't figure that shit out.  I don't know.  Anything in there.  Fucking music.  It is horrendous.  Because you want to keep the listenership up, and you want one show to seg into the other nicely.  Right.  But sometimes at five or ten minutes, whatever it is, between the two shows.  It's a long time.  It's un-fucking-listenable. 
[02:43:00]  So when I'm driving home, and I want to pop on Ron and Fez, and I turn them on a couple  of minutes early, a few minutes early, and that's all you get.  It's like, oh, fuck.  Nothing against the sponsors.  It's how it's being played on the channel.  Yay!  It's obviously filler.  Well, find this.  Oh, we need 30 seconds.  All right, play this promo that just ran two minutes ago.  Okay, we need another 30 seconds.  Play that promo again.  It doesn't matter that they just heard that.  Right?  Yeah, I should put something a little entertaining in there.  That seems like it would be an easy fix.  All right, we'll continue with your show next. 
[02:43:30]  Do-do-do-do-do.  Obi and Anthony, blah, blah, blah.  JB from Ontario.  It's your show today.  You guys are giving us some suggestions on the instant feedback and on the phones, and  then we're going to just run with some of this stuff today.  JB in Ontario writes, hey, guys, not sure if you covered this on the FM side, but I heard  a funny story on the news last night saying that an Illinois couple was married at a Taco  Bell.  Oh, yeah.  L-M-A-O. 
[02:44:00]  Only in America.  The land of opportunity.  Ha-ha.  And then he has to write, the lucky couple got a free combo.  Oh, is that what they got?  We do have the story, though.  Why would they?  Oh, we've loved Taco Bell.  We met at Taco Bell.  What is it?  They meet there?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  There was nothing normal about this wedding in normal.  This guy again.  Yeah.  Somebody on our staff found this guy.  I love when this guy tells us the news. 
[02:44:30]  There was nothing normal about this wedding in normal, Illinois.  Paul and Kara Brooks said their I do's inside a Taco Bell.  The bride and groom met on the Internet.  She moved to the U.S. from Australia.  He proposed on New Year's Eve.  We didn't want to do things in the traditional sense.  We're a little bit of an offbeat couple, so we figured we wanted to have an offbeat ceremony.  And Taco Bell is the closest thing we have to a church.  So this is where we like to hang out. 
[02:45:00]  This is where we wanted to do it.  It's more comfortable, I think, than most weddings because people are somewhere where they're comfortable.  It's not, like, stuffed into a church or in a courthouse or anything like that.  The restaurant got into the act with romantic hot sauce packets and wedding bell balloons.  Wedding guests could snack on tacos that go for under a dollar.  The food wasn't the only inexpensive part.  The bride's hot pink wedding gown cost just 15 bucks.  There you go.  Are you a fan of the silly wedding yet?  No. 
[02:45:30]  I'm a fan of any wedding.  Well, I understand that.  But, I mean, when you...  Silly wedding.  When you see, like, you know, the scuba divers getting married underwater or getting married in a hot air balloon or...  Does it just make you go...  Yeah.  It's a gag.  Yeah.  Taking something sacred and turning it into a joke.  I'll have a gag divorce.  A gag divorce?  Yeah.  Like a scuba diver.  And then you give them each a knife and whoever cuts the other one's oxygen supply gets to keep everything. 
[02:46:00]  You know, you bring up a good point, though.  Why not the gag divorce?  Yeah.  You're scuba diving with the one that she still thinks you're into it.  And next thing you know, like some other diver comes out of nowhere with a little message.  Yeah.  He's fucking his secretary.  Go fuck yourself.  He wants a divorce.  Serves your papers.  Underwater or something, right?  Maybe surfaces too quickly, gets the bends.  Yeah.  See, people don't think these days.  The silly wedding has been done a million times.  Do the silly divorce. 
[02:46:30]  Now you're talking.  Mm-hmm.  Now you're talking some good coverage out there.  Yeah, unfortunately, people don't have a sense of humor when they're going through a divorce.  That doesn't matter.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Let's say hi to Don in Baltimore.  Don.  Is that Don on the phone?  Yeah, yeah.  Don on Baltimore.  Go Ravens.  Go Ravens.  Yeah.  Who are the Ravens playing?  I'm embarrassed I don't even know who's left in this thing.  Is it the Steelers?  Yep.  Go Steelers.  Come on.  Oh, come on.  But, hey, what about that little baby that got born? 
[02:47:00]  I love how we just had a come on thing.  Come on.  You went, I went come on, and then you went come on back.  Ah, well.  It was nice.  It was Baltimore.  We're a bunch of followers, right?  I hate Baltimore.  Nice.  Baltimore, bro.  Although, when you're taking that, although, when you're taking that Accela, and they bring  you through the neighborhoods that they filmed the wire in, wow.  Mm-hmm.  That's some good viewing out your window.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  We love our town, especially the crackheads and the eight-feelers. 
[02:47:30]  But what about the baby with the foot in his brain?  Did you hear about that?  He had a foot in his brain, like part of another foot, and they took it out.  Wow.  We got a lot of people working behind the scenes of the show, and that one has slipped by us.  Wow.  It was on the Today Show.  The baby and the family were on.  Wow.  Well, like a conjoined twin foot was in his brain?  Well, I would say it was like a tumor that was like, you know, whatever.  How did they know he had it? 
[02:48:00]  Did he say, like, I can't stop thinking about toes?  Yeah.  Well, he's like, I'm always smelling feet.  What's up?  What's up?  Yeah.  There's the pic.  Oh, crap.  Wow.  That is a baby foot.  And where was that?  In the brain.  In the brain of what?  Probably.  Wait, the baby didn't make it?  No, it did.  He was.  Wait, what?  E-Rock, you've got a mic in front of you.  He must have been a great at headstands.  I don't know.  No, we need more on this story. 
[02:48:30]  Well, he's got a thing on his feet.  He was fishing a sock on in my hair.  Wait, I'm looking at a really disgusting picture, and it looks like that thing did not survive.  But you're telling me the baby's still alive?  The story is that they also found, like, other parts of bodies when they started going deeper into this tumor.  Like, they found, I think they said, like, a butt cheek, but I might have misheard of that one.  Oh, wait, that's the whole tumor we're seeing after they removed it?  Yeah.  The teratoma.  Yeah.  They think it's, um, it was the fetal twin that didn't quite make it. 
[02:49:00]  It's also a teratoma, which is a type of tumor where the cells think they're something else.  Yeah.  So they'll have teeth in them.  Yeah.  Hair.  Or hair, eyes.  They get all confused and just start making something they're not supposed to make.  I love that shit.  Stupid cells.  I think I'm going to, I think I'm going to make myself into a nose.  But you're in the stomach, sir.  Oh.  No, I think, uh, I just feel like I need to be a nose.  Imagine pulling a tumor out of your stomach and his teeth on it, how silly you'd feel. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  They said it did.  To brush him.  It's disgusting.  Floss him.  Yeah.  They said they cut the kid open, and, uh, it just popped out of the brain.  It just shot out as soon as they cut the head open.  What, the foot?  The foot.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  It actually went, hi-yah!  A little kick.  All right, I'm out.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Good job.  All right, a lot of people are nervous when I say go Steelers.  I don't care.  That's the difference with the sports curse.  I don't really care.  The best I can tell you is I'm going to take a peek at the game. 
[02:50:00]  That's it.  That is it.  Uh...  I'm not even going to do that.  Huh?  I have no interest in the, uh, Super Bowl.  Uh...  And why hasn't anyone brought up the fact that Plaxico just fucked his team up?  Yeah.  Giants fans, where are you?  They didn't need that controversy at the end of the year.  Fat stomach.  What?  I just said my fat stomach.  Aw, Jimmy.  I just saw it as you were talking.  I moved and jiggled.  I was like, ugh.  Well, the Giants didn't have to suspend him either. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, he didn't get convicted of anything.  Well, it's that whole goody two-shoes thing.  An image.  Fuck the NFL and fuck the Giants.  They should have kept him until he's convicted.  Once you're convicted.  You just gotta go with your players.  Who gives a shit what they're up to, you know, when they're not on the field?  I don't give a crap.  Who's not a kid, fucker?  Who gives a turkey?  Give me all these animals.  I'll put a team together.  How many of the Cowboys were criminals, like, uh, three years back when they actually had a good team?  Michael Vick would so be my quarterback if I had a franchise.  I wouldn't give a shit.  Get him out of jail and get him on that field. 
[02:51:00]  I'll just ignore all the controversy.  I don't care.  I just want to see the best players on that field.  I don't give a shit what they do behind the scenes.  Who cares?  By the way, we said that Dungy, uh, quit football yesterday, and supposedly there's some nice crying audio.  Ah, come on.  Seems like a lot of people are dropping the ball today.  We're big fans of the crying audio.  If we can find that.  I guess he didn't make it one sentence without, you know, blubbering.  So, can we find that, please? 
[02:51:30]  Uh, let's say hi to Tripp in Georgia.  Tripp.  Hello.  Hey, Tripp.  Love you.  Love the show.  Love your show.  Love your suit.  Love your suit.  There's a kind checker on death row.  Eight pulled his other eyeball out and ate it.  Because he pulled the first one out about three years ago when they first put him in prison.  What? 
[02:52:00]  Toughened his nipples, didn't it?  Tell me, Mom, when it's your brain-footed baby lying on the slab.  Uh, dummy alert, dummy alert, dummy alert, dummy alert, dummy alert.  Oh?  Going backwards.  Writing from Whackbag writes,  Opie, I think Plaxico would have had a tough time playing with that hole in his leg.  Well, you know that... 
[02:52:30]  Dummy alert, dummy alert.  That is a good point.  Dummy alert.  May have been on the disabled list a while with a bullet hole in your leg.  I call myself out as far as the dummy alert goes.  Maybe it would have healed.  How bad could it have been?  I'm going to try to hang in there.  Maybe he would have been all right.  Wrap it up.  For the game this past Sunday.  Shoot it up with some cortisone.  You know what?  I'm not going to be made a dummy yet.  I'm thinking he could have played this past Sunday.  Yeah? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Bum.  It was a superficial.  Yeah, it was.  Was it a superficial?  I don't even know.  They said.  All right.  Where else do you want to go?  Let's go to Brett in Rochester.  Brett.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Well, last week at a Sabres game, we were playing Ottawa, and Jarko Routu of Ottawa went  and bit Andrew Peters in the Sabres.  It was fucking ridiculous.  Like, there's a whole video of it on YouTube.  It's not ridiculous.  You can just go follow Sabres bite and find it.  Is that allowable? 
[02:53:30]  It's not ridiculous.  Hockey should allow this.  You know, the funny thing is, we got, the Sabres got a, what the hell is it called, a unsportsmanlike  penalty because he got bit and started waving his hand and started freaking out because  this ain't fucking boxing.  We're not playing Tyson.  Right.  Hell.  I think they should allow biting in hockey.  Because then the shock of the players, did he just fucking bite me?  And then you would get bloodier fights.  And that's all, I'm all about the bloody fights.  I don't care what it takes to get the fights, the fight quote off. 
[02:54:00]  I'm all about the fights.  And he got suspended?  Actually, I don't think he got suspended.  In fact, the Buffalo Sabres got the penalty for that whole entire incident, which I was  pretty pissed off about.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for bringing that to everyone's attention.  I did read about that.  I didn't think it was worth bringing to the show.  But it is your show today, so.  Yes.  Hey, Dungy did not cry.  I'm getting a Ron and Fez spy report.  What the fuck?  He didn't shed one goddamn tear. 
[02:54:30]  But the owner of the team did.  According to multiple sources on instant feedback.  That's different.  Hence why the boys did not bring the crying audio to our attention.  All right.  In between trying to figure out where the listeners want to go with this show, we got this uncomfortable  moment from a news program.  And a naked intruder named Michael Dick is under arrest after barging into an elderly  woman's home.  The 88-year-old homeowner says at first she wasn't sure what to do when Dick walked right 
[02:55:00]  in through his life.  Hey, I...  I'm laughing, Dick.  Someone's calling you out, Ant.  Tell Ant to quit e-trading and join the show.  It's apparent the show is his second most important task right now.  Is that true, my friend?  No.  Are you e-trading?  No, I don't even have e-trade up.  All right.  Who the fuck said that?  And somebody that doesn't want to leave his name.  Who is it?  He just...  It's 540...  The whole number thing.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself is his answer.  If listeners pop on, if they got shit to say, what am I supposed to have a genius fucking 
[02:55:30]  response to everything stupid fucking listeners call in with?  You've sucked shit.  We leave the show to you for a while, and your subject matter sucks.  You're supposed to make gold out of one of my alchemists?  Make gold out of shit?  Fuck you.  We don't like it.  We'll leave.  Well, they know you e-trade from time to time, and they thought maybe you were e-trading. 
[02:56:00]  That's all.  What's the market doing?  I don't even know.  Down 1,500.  What happened to our 9,000?  Why are we pushing that 9,000?  Oh, that went away.  Now we're right around 8,500 today.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  That's all right.  That was up 20, so I'm not getting much action.  We're hanging in there.  Yep.  I just read my...  I think the crisis is over.  I think you're right, and I just put...  I'm starting to go back in to get some of the money back, and I don't know what to do yet.  Metal Tires is a company that specializes in metal tires.  Metal Tires? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, and I feel they have a big future, because people like the sound it makes when you go over a curb.  It's going to fucking house now.  A metal tire.  You know how unpleasant they would be in potholes?  The Metal Tire Company, yeah.  Clang!  Oh, would that hurt your back?  Your head on the...  Because I want to take all the stupid cloth inside of the car and just have metal cars  so people are comfy in their seats.  You wouldn't...  I don't think you'd get much traction.  I think you'd slide on the ice.  No, I mean...  Yeah, you would... 
[02:57:00]  All right, that's what I'm trying to look at.  Metal Tires.  So they're heated, too.  Oh.  They're heated tires.  Oh.  It's a long plug.  I want a...  Your idea stinks.  I want a billionaire that just has, obviously, all his money to burn,  to come up with, like, the most ridiculous product ever  and insist, no matter what the people around him say,  no, we're going to do this thing.  How about this?  A car that explodes if you slam the door too hard.  And you just insist. 
[02:57:30]  You make them.  You have them just sit.  Have them sit at the car dealership.  Oh, and you tell everybody what the deal is.  But it's, you know, the car only costs $10 or something.  But you don't care because you've got money to burn.  Yeah.  Where the trunk of the car, you open it, and it's just a toilet seat.  And people will be like,  well, I don't want to use the bathroom in the trunk of my car.  And, like, well, it's not an option.  It comes standard.  And there's an open hole over the road,  so you're just shitting onto the highway.  You signed up for this, too, you know. 
[02:58:00]  Then the small car, you have to shit for your own car.  And it's freezing because it's cold out.  Yeah.  Trying to make it dookie.  I like that so far.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  We're a car with a steering wheel right in the middle.  Yeah?  Like, right in between the, like, passenger and driver's seats,  you have no room for anything except you have two giant buckets of marbles.  So when you make sharp turns, they make that, like, marble in a bucket sound.  Two giant buckets of marbles. 
[02:58:30]  You have to move them when you get in and out of the car.  It would be so inconvenient.  That would be so inconvenient.  Yeah.  30-pound bucket of marbles.  And you're sitting in the middle.  Yeah.  Oh, I wouldn't like that.  Yeah, so you have to put your arm in the marble bucket and they try to relax.  What about your passengers?  There's only, it's a two-seater.  There's you, there's the marble buckles, and then behind you, there's a fucking, there's  like five toilet paper dispensers and then a seat for your passenger.  That's what you do. 
[02:59:00]  And fucking, you have, like, gun ports on the side.  I don't think it's going to sell.  Your passenger can jerk off out the fucking passenger without it.  So I was taking my billionaire idea, and God, I hope we can say this without getting  in trouble, because, you know, all we try to do here is tell jokes and make people laugh  and forget about their misery out there.  Redding from Whackbag writes, Opie, a billionaire has already done what you're talking about.  It's called Howard 100 and Howard 101.  Ah.  Is that too far, or do I get the email? 
[02:59:30]  No.  Let's play, do I get the email?  Do I get the email?  No.  Or the phone call?  Ah.  Oh, and then somebody needs to find this for us.  Blake Daly, he writes, hey guys, Google Cambodian midget fighting league versus lion.  It's an old story, but I've never heard you guys talk about it.  Did we talk about this one?  This one, I think, is bullshit.  I just heard about it on the Ricky Gervais podcast. 
[03:00:00]  Please find that and discuss.  So we'll see if we can discuss that.  I'm pretty sure it's bullshit, though.  All right, let's find out for ourselves.  Anchors have trouble getting through stories.  That's where we were.  Yeah.  So I don't know where the trouble is, but we'll find out.  And a naked intruder named Michael Dick is under arrest after barging into an elderly  woman's home.  The 88-year-old homeowner says at first she wasn't sure what to do when Dick walked right  in through a glass door and began pushing her around. 
[03:00:30]  I thought it was somebody I knew, but then seeing him without clothing, you know, it's  nobody you know.  I kept saying, no, no, no.  And then I said, holy mother.  And then I said, God.  And he stopped.  And that's when I reached him around and grabbed him.  He came around and said she grabbed him.  And the old reach-around, nice.  Yeah, well.  As a trooper.  No kidding. 
[03:01:00]  And police say she grabbed him the testicles because she remembered seeing a story on the  news where another woman did the same thing in that situation, and she survived at work.  Dick ran away.  He was caught a few minutes later after the homeowner called police.  He ejaculated her forearm.  I'm glad you had to read that story.  You guys didn't help me any out here, but I got through.  The CIA has found a way to firm up its relationship with warlords in Afghanistan.  The Washington Post says agents are trading Viagra for key information about terrorists. 
[03:01:30]  In one case, they gave a few pills to a 60-year-old warlord with four younger wives.  Now, a few days later, he gave agents detailed information about Taliban movements in exchange  for more pills.  The agents say the pills could put Chieftain's, quote, back in an authoritative position, unquote.  I think they were trying to get us.  You can read anything, can't you?  No, but they were trying to get us on those last two stories.  We persevered.  We persevered.  Happy New Year. 
[03:02:00]  We persevered.  Happy New Year.  She could not take it.  The laughing newsman.  I know.  It's just crazy.  Yes.  It's like the Carol Burnett moment happening.  Snopes, which, of course, dispels urban legends.  They're a bunch of liars.  No, I think they're pretty reputable.  They're liars.  Very reputable.  Lions versus midgets equals false.  Abu.  Yep.  I remember.  I read that a while back, and it came up false. 
[03:02:30]  I got to snope some people forward me crap.  You get that forwarded stuff, and it's like, did you hear that this person said this?  And then you go to Snopes, you pop their name, and it goes, no, it's bullshit.  And then you send it back, CC'd with everyone that the forward was forwarded to.  Right.  So you make whoever sent the original thing look like an ass.  How do you know Snopes is real?  Yeah, for real.  Because they kind of do tell you where they got the information from. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Like where the myth came from in the first place.  A lot of the myths are like kind of shoot-offs from old myths that used to spread by Xerox around the office.  And they go back, and they'll actually find the source of it a lot of times.  It could be 1800s or whatever.  Yes.  They do, actually.  I know.  The founder, Ted Snopes, just felt that there was too many rumors circulating. 
[03:03:30]  Of course, he wouldn't like that.  No.  But he dispels a lot of rumor, Ted Snopes.  Yes, but he also confirms things that people might think are.  Yeah, yeah, that too.  Yeah.  He's good at that, Ted.  Yes.  Do you know what my favorite myth to dispel was?  What's that, Ted?  That the abominable snowman was a Seattle Seahawks fan.  It was a pack of lies. 
[03:04:00]  How did you dispel that?  I was near his lair, and I saw a charger's hat.  Well, that would dispel.  Snopes!  Is that your last name?  It's my nickname.  Oh, Ted Snopes.  Yes.  Because you said what your last name was once before. 
[03:04:30]  Yes, but I don't remember.  I didn't either.  I was hoping you would.  I'm forgetful.  I was just trying to see if somebody does have it.  I'm sure someone does.  Yeah, idiots remember everything.  Except that, maybe.  You know what it was?  I would say nopes a lot when I was a kid.  Like, they would say, hey, you want to go out?  Nopes.  And they would go, good, Ted's nopes again.  And I was just trying to say it. 
[03:05:00]  Ted is a douche.  Ted is a goddamn fool.  My name is Ted Sheckler.  Is it Sheckler?  It certainly is.  I don't think it was Sheckler.  Well, you think what you want.  I'll dispel it.  No one's got it. 
[03:05:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Also, do we have an update on Howie Mandel?  People are asking.  Our friend Howie was rushed to the hospital, what, yesterday?  Or earlier this morning?  Probably yesterday.  Up there in Toronto.  And has an irregular heartbeat.  False!  Ted Snopes.  That's a falsehood.  He wants to 7-Eleven to buy a hat. 
[03:06:00]  Fucking germaphobe.  Ted Snopes would know.  Yes, he would.  He's like the drudge of celeb rumors and mystique.  Mystique.  Yes.  No one's got that.  I can't remember.  It's bugging the shit out of me.  It's Sheckler.  Was it?  Ted Sheckler.  Yes.  I thought it was something.  It was probably some other dump character's name. 
[03:06:30]  I'll disconnect these Shecklers.  Did someone say Marv Grusto?  No, that was the name that Colin gave me on fucking Tough Crowd.  Oh, right.  I did a sketch with him and Will Ferrell.  Will's name was, he's the hotshot lawyer.  I think his name was Pete Jackson.  He gave the worst names.  And he's...  And he was Pete Jackson.  I didn't know it was like really overacted.  And he goes, and my, this young lawyer, Marv Grusto.  And it was me with my hand on my hip.  Fucking terrible.  Yeah, it was supposed to be like really bad names. 
[03:07:00]  I used to love those sketches.  Oh, they were so great.  Were they one take Ed Wood things?  Oh, they were fantastic.  Got to get Colin back in here.  Been at him on in a while.  Yeah, where is he?  I like when he's on with Voss.  Yeah.  Those two idiots.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Sparring.  And continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Let's go.  Come on. 
[03:07:30]  I got a great story.  As the listeners regroup.  So you got to regroup when it's your show, you see?  Not that easy.  They suck.  They kind of suck today.  I'd like to develop this bit, but so far, not so good.  So far, not so good.  Can I give the show to the listeners?  Yes, Jimmy.  Can I ask something I forgot to mention before?  Because I got a Kenny told me.  No.  You're right.  Teasing, Jimmy.  Of course, please mention. 
[03:08:00]  But I don't.  I know I've been parped on Sunday's show.  It's a lottery story unlike so many others.  Where chance was followed quickly by faint and grief.  But they did release certain tickets on Friday.  Possibly Saturday because there's casino comps.  It was rude.  What happened?  Nothing happened.  You keep going.  Okay.  The Bogartas sold out Friday, Saturday, but they've released some casino comps.  There might be 30 tickets released for Friday, possibly Saturday, too.  Yeah.  This is why I hate casino comps, because they released them a couple days before the show. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  So you're getting a nice seat.  Yeah, they're actually really good seats.  Yeah.  I better get one of those.  Yeah, you'll get where you want.  I ain't paying a CEO.  No, don't blame me.  Why would you?  I'm kidding.  No one did.  In fact, I've sold eight tickets a night.  The rest were casino comps.  Listen, funny.  795 casino comps released today.  And I'm going to Miami the week after next week.  It's this coming Wednesday.  I'm going to be in the Miami area.  All right.  So you're a jet setter.  My Uncle Hyman Roth lives down there. 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  Yes.  You can hear them in the audience.  Where do people go these days for your dates there, Jimmy?  Only MySpace, because eat a bullet sucks a dick.  I'm having it redone.  All right.  Because that fucking accurate imaging company, I asked them to do stuff.  I couldn't send out mass emails.  It's a horrendous experience I have with them.  Jordan from Pittsburgh.  All right, if it's our show, they're calling us out, Anthony.  Yep.  All right.  We kind of gave the show to the listeners today, but this guy, he's got a good point.  Jordan from Pittsburgh.  He's calling us out.  He writes, if it's our show truly, I want someone to open hand slap E-Rock's man tits just so I can laugh. 
[03:09:30]  Now, if we don't do this, that means it's not really the listener's show today.  It's their show.  E-Rock?  Anybody out there that is even...  We were talking about you.  I know.  All right.  Well, get on mic.  Would you allow somebody to open hand slap your man tits?  I guess so.  It is their show today.  I guess so.  For the listeners, yes. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  Who wants to do it?  Jimmy, can you do it?  No.  I think a listener.  Wow.  I don't know.  Well, it is the listener's show.  Then you have a listener actually slap E-Rock's man tits.  Yeah.  Who would really want to slap your man tits?  Who doesn't like you on staff?  Would you imagine they're E-Rock?  Let's be honest.  How about Sam?  Everybody.  Who doesn't like you?  Maybe Sam comes in right at the...  I'm just walking in.  I...  No, he's got the camera.  Sam, you kind of like E-Rock? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, I pretend not to.  You pretend not to, but you actually like him?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know there's some of that that does go on.  Who doesn't like you on staff?  Would you imagine, E-Rock?  Hmm.  Um, whose foot have you stepped on?  Probably, well, lately, probably Poe.  Well, he's not here.  Oh, he's not here.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck it.  Um, well, Danny would do it, but Danny's not here either.  Right?  Yeah, Danny would do it in a second.  Now it's getting crazy, the listener's show. 
[03:11:00]  I want Steve to blow Jimmy.  Come on, we're going with this a little bit, but...  Jimmy volunteers.  I know he'll do it good.  E-Rock?  Who doesn't like you?  Travis?  Travis, I'd imagine Travis doesn't like you.  You want to do it, Travis?  He's coming.  Travis.  What?  We got, like...  I'll do it, but I'm not here.  No offense, but you guys are fucking, like, not really the biggest, bulkiest guys...  I disagree.  ...that we can find films.  Sam and I are very good looking.  And how do you open hand-slap man tits, by the way? 
[03:11:30]  Wait, it's like a nature boy chop.  I better do this.  It's like a Ric Flair chop.  Oh, you know how to do it?  Yeah, I know how to do it.  I better do this.  But could E-Rock make it more humiliating and kind of squish them together?  I know that's a little different than how the WWE does it, but...  So he would squish his man tits together.  And then where does the slap actually take place?  Is it in the cleavage?  Well...  Is it underneath his breast?  He has to hold it from the bottom and push it together.  I think if E-Rock, like, pushes way from the sides to give plenty... 
[03:12:00]  Like this, look.  Yeah, he'll have huge tits.  Give Sam a nice target, all right?  And then you're hitting the cleavage?  Yeah, you hit the cleavage, and then the goal would be to get, like, a red handprint.  But then when he lets go, it's going to look like two halves, like one half of a hand,  and the other half, and it'll be separated by his chest meat.  Yeah.  We could write a Mad Magazine thing.  Yes, like a Mad Magazine fold-over rear page.  Am I right?  Get up, E-Rock.  It is their show today, and this is what they want. 
[03:12:30]  Assholes.  Yep.  All right.  John from Utah, stop with listener content.  We admit we're not as funny.  Ah, finally.  Well, this is good right here.  You got it, E-Rock?  Let's get a little focus.  E-Rock's got little 12-year-old boobs.  Those big nipples.  They're little buds.  Oh, my God, E-Rock, yeah.  You've got little training bra boobs.  He has butting breasts. 
[03:13:00]  What?  Why would that be on?  E-Rock's tits would look like the cover of the Blind Faith album.  That's a reference.  Nice.  All right.  All right.  All right, you got to...  Is he doing it right?  No, you got to...  No, I think...  He can't do it.  I think...  He's got to go all the way from the side.  He can't squish his boobs together.  But they're very man-booby.  How about you just slap without squishing them together, because...  Can you?  Because you can hurt them more that way. 
[03:13:30]  No offense, Eric.  No, I think...  All right.  Sam, you know what you're doing?  You know what you're doing?  You know what you're doing?  Yeah.  You know what you're doing?  Yeah.  You know what you're doing?  Yeah.  Oh, you think you should squish them?  Maybe...  Squish them together.  Let's see.  What?  You should squish them together.  Answer this one minute.  So squish them.  Is there room there?  Can you tape them?  Oh, my God.  Those are boobs.  Dude, that's hysterical.  You've got, like, real boobs.  Wait.  It is audience participation here.  They would rather hear Sam do the motorboat. 
[03:14:00]  That I don't know how to do.  Fair enough.  Hey, the audience is cheering that.  I hear them cheering in the background a little bit.  What do you say, Sam?  No, because we've got to get somebody...  For the radio.  Atta boy, Sam.  For the radio.  Sam's a good kid.  It's not gay if it's for the radio.  Yeah.  Don't cover up, like, some fucking...  Rape victim?  Like, yeah.  Or, like, some stripper between songs.  Yeah.  Like, they've got some kind of fucking morality.  Yeah.  I don't like this song.  Oh, could you eject this? 
[03:14:30]  And they cover up.  Yeah.  Ah.  What do you say there, E-Rock?  Would you let him motorboat you?  I'd rather just take the slap.  E-Rock, when did you let yourself go?  Oh, 1980.  Like, is it the holiday?  Was it the holiday thing?  Or life, either one.  No, because he was like...  He was...  He lost so much weight, and then you just fucked it all up.  Yeah.  It happens.  All right.  I say we do the motorboat, Sam.  But if we do the motorboat followed by the slap, that way all the listeners are happy. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Followed by the slap?  Yeah.  I'll wheel and deal with you.  You do a good motorboat.  You get to do the karate chop slap thing.  Sure.  Why is E-Rock laughing?  He's warming up.  Exactly.  How's it going to sound there, Sam?  Let me see your...  Oh.  Okay.  Way to get the gay out.  I was going to say, just keep telling yourself this is not gay.  This is not gay. 
[03:15:30]  This is not gay.  Here goes Sam.  He's getting close to...  E-Rock's wrong moves.  E-Rock didn't like that.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  It's so weird.  He was frightened.  The vibrations.  He was frightened.  What happened?  Did it vibrate a little too much?  It was gross.  And wet.  It was wet.  Sam.  Oh, come on.  Fuck, Sam.  I spit a little.  I spit a little.  Man.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Just give E-Rock a stage where that bull here can rage. 
[03:16:00]  Come on, champ.  He looks like Lamont when they woke him up.  Here's the symptom, man.  Now here's the slap.  It was the deal we made.  E-Rock, you're prepared for this, right?  No, but go ahead.  Across his man boobs.  Here goes Sam.  Oh, fuck it!  Did it hurt?  Can that stop a heart?  Maybe we should, like, test drive some of this shit. 
[03:16:30]  Nah, not an open hand.  Oh, wow.  Let's see.  Is it all red?  Wow, I think I see a handprint.  Wait, come under the light.  I want to see the handprint.  It's like I'm sunburned.  Holy shit!  Yes, Sam.  I can't see it, right?  Look at that handprint.  Show the audience.  It's like hyper-colored skin.  Show the audience.  Go under the light.  I can't see it.  You should have done it on the stomach.  No, you can see it.  Oh, there's a fucking light.  Do you want one more?  Hey, E-Rock, can you hit one of your stomachs?  I can't see it.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, I can see the handprint.  You should put it on your stomach.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, let him do it on his belly.  Well, you know, it's actually on our show.  It's a listener show.  The listeners are saying they want him to hit him in the belly like that.  Oh, wow, that's rough.  The listeners.  Is there any I can hit him in the face afterwards?  You have a handprint on your chest.  How'd that happen?  That's pretty good.  Exactly.  I wasn't looking where I was going.  Why, is it warm now?  It, it, it's like I'm having a breathing problem. 
[03:17:30]  Don't say that.  No, no, I'm not, but you know when your lungs get really raw from, from, from, like if you're  swimming in a pool or something and you inhale and.  Well, it's probably the reaction.  You brought up some of that old air when you went, ah!  Old air.  And a sandwich.  Old food.  And a sandwich.  I heard you.  I heard you.  A lot of people saying the slap was amazing.  It was great.  It was a good sound on the, ah, on the old radio.  Yeah, they liked that one. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  It's safe.  They do it in wrestling all the time.  All right, let's say hi to Tugboat.  It was a wrestling move.  Thank you to Iraq.  Thanks to Sam.  It was just for the show, Sam.  Tugboat.  Hey, guys.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hey, I'd like to, ah, make an observation about fat ladies and spandex.  Yesterday I was at Walmart and it's about 22 degrees down here in Indiana right now.  And this lady was wearing a tube top and spandex that just barely came to her knees, flip-flops 
[03:18:30]  and nothing else.  And let me tell you, gentlemen, if I could have taken a picture and sent this to you,  it was something to behold.  Now, this woman.  I can't tell if she's hot or a pig right now, the way he's describing it.  Fat woman.  Oh, he said fat?  She really big fat person?  Yeah.  350 pounds if she was an ounce.  Wow.  And guys, look at me tonight.  I'm a big fat fucker.  Ms. Whitman was in the tub.  So I know.  Was that where she was?  Yeah, I finally figured that out. 
[03:19:00]  That disgusting mess in the bath.  Was it Ms. Whitman?  It was Ms. Whitman.  I'm pretty sure.  Ms. Whitman.  So you don't like when fat women were in the spandex?  What's that?  Well, the thing is, is, you know, fat people can dress appropriately and not look so bad.  Yeah, they were a pig mess.  I think that lady had ding-dongs, cupcakes, and I think a couple of pies.  So, I mean.  A couple of what?  Yeah, we heard.  Want to steal Jimmy's piss?  That's okay. 
[03:19:30]  It's fun to do.  A couple of pies and she's ready to miss earmuffs.  I hope she sits next to one of you guys.  Squeeze that one.  One of these days.  All right.  We got you.  Thank you, Tugboat.  Bye, Tugboat.  Tugboat.  That's a big look for the fat broad.  It's easy.  It's the long sweater thing.  The spandex.  Then the sweater's got to come down mid-thigh to cover the world of hurt.  Hey, someone has suggested that, Iraq, would you be up for this?  Tim and Jersey.  You want a great slap?  Try a sneaker sole on the stomach. 
[03:20:00]  Holy shit.  You will read Reebok in reverse.  Radio gold, my friends.  Would you take a sneaker to the belly?  No.  Would tank hankerous?  You got the perfect silly putty belly, though, for this.  Silly putty.  No, that's even worse.  How are you feeling, Tank?  Silly duddy.  It's all kingly.  Can we do human silly putty with Iraq right now?  Yeah.  Let's see if his belly will pick up a comic strip on the newspaper.  You got a voice that's just right.  Silly dummy.  Silly dummy. 
[03:20:30]  We need a comic.  Any color picture.  Try to get Obama on the front.  I like Ziggy.  With his fucking cock nose that hangs out of the fence.  Is there a comic in that paper?  Funny papers.  I have no idea.  He puts his belly on a funny paper.  I hate fucking Blondie.  No one likes Blondie.  Dagwood.  Dennis the Menace.  Here's your choice.  That's it?  Dennis the Menace should work and go to school in Columbine.  That's the modern day Dennis the Menace. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  True Menace.  They're really cutting down the comics.  You got Garfield, Wizard, Rhymes with Orange, Mallard, Fillmore.  Rhymes with Bunt was my idea.  No paper would pick it up.  Featured a different woman every week.  Dennis the Menace or Non-Sequitur?  Wow.  That's it?  What about the Daily News?  We got to get a bad one.  We got to get like a Beetle Bailey or something.  Marmadouche.  Yeah.  One of those dumb ones.  All right.  Or we could do Argyle. 
[03:21:30]  Wow.  I haven't read the comics in a while.  I've never heard of half of these.  Okay.  I got close to home.  The Flying McCoys.  Lockhorns.  Ah.  That's a classic.  Marmadouche is in this paper there.  Roses, Rose, Gasoline Alley, Get Fuzzy, Dilbert, Curtis, Zitz, Dilbert.  Right.  Does it matter?  Dilbert.  I know.  Just wet it a little bit.  Now, this has a lot of dark ink.  Let's go with the Lockhorns.  And then shove his belly on it.  We'll do a double and Marmadouche. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  You got to get the belly just right.  The Marmadouche with Marmadouche.  A Marmadouche.  Let's get Sam to supervise this.  They're calling it Silly Gutty.  Did we use that line?  Silly Gutty.  No, it's funny.  All right.  That worked.  What's in that spray bottle up there?  Where?  Up there.  That clear one there.  Sam, you got to make this work.  We're using Febreze.  Febreze?  No, that won't work.  We're using Fatso as a human.  Silly Gutty. 
[03:22:30]  As human silly putty.  Okay.  I love that.  That is a good one.  Now, we got to wet down his belly with something.  Yeah.  A little water.  Yeah.  Evenly distributed.  Not soaking wet.  Right.  It's just got to be damp.  A little damp.  You know?  Yeah.  Don't hose them down like when they march them through the Midtown Tunnel.  Like...  You should take the shirt off.  You got to take the shirt off.  No, I'm all right.  I agree, though, because you're just going to interfere with the paper.  Yeah, it's going to rub off.  I'm not trying to make fun of you.  Just wet enough like you're sweating. 
[03:23:00]  Like you walked up a step.  Why?  It's just mean.  The shirt should be off.  That would imply...  The shirt should be off.  The shirt's fine.  It would imply that, wouldn't it?  We got to take the shirt off.  Yeah.  Sam said.  Take your goddamn shirt off.  How far are the belly we're using?  Oh, the handprint's looking good.  Let's see.  Wow, it's so swollen.  Oh, wow.  It's crazy.  It looks like African branding art.  I was going to say, it looks like a black man's tattoo. 
[03:23:30]  It's all branding.  Wow, Sam, you got a perfect hit on him.  Do you got a picture of that?  Get under a light.  That hit him perfectly.  Wow, despite the same thing to help me like the exorcist.  Turn it all sideways so you can see the raised...  Oh, my God.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah, it's burning.  Wow, that's a good one.  Holy Toledo, are you a chubster?  Oh, my.  All right.  Is it, that's pretty cool.  Hold on, Iraq.  I might...  No, it's not.  All right, Sam, is his belly moist? 
[03:24:00]  Let me check here.  Not anymore.  Let's see this picture.  All right, let's see.  Wow, you can't see it right now.  Oh, no, I need to see more moist.  All right, you got to supervise here.  We want to make sure we can turn him into a human silly putty today.  All right.  Look at that handprint.  It's raised.  Silly gutty, remember?  Silly gutty, sorry, right.  Absolutely.  Is it moist enough?  Yeah.  Because he's got a big gut.  Right.  All right, hold on.  It fucking works.  Hold on. 
[03:24:30]  Get on the light again.  My system was full and I got...  Turn this way.  There's only one way to really get the ink to stick to the belly, too.  Oh, my God.  You got to rub.  Wow.  You got to put it on...  That's what it was with the silly putty.  At least it worked with silly putty.  You take that and then you rub to the back of the comic.  Mm-hmm.  Get a little more moistness on the belly.  Silly gutty.  Yeah.  A little moistness.  There you go. 
[03:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then, Sam, just make sure you rub.  Get a good one.  Okay.  Okay.  So first you just apply it.  Apply.  Rub.  Make sure it's all covered is what the...  Sam, it's going to be a tough job for you, but you got to rub it in there.  Right.  I know you don't want to do this, but it is for the radio.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, shit.  I told him to do that.  Ah! 
[03:25:30]  Like, rub it.  It smacks him in the belly.  Oh, he's just trying to rub it.  The E-Rock, ow, is one of the best screams ever.  The E-Rock belt you hard?  Whether it's his armpit hair being ripped out or him being slapped by some bitch, or,  you know, Sam.  You make a great scream there, E-Rock.  Let me see the belly one now.  Is there part of the comic on there, too? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah, there's the square outline.  It ripped.  I slapped you hard.  You slapped it.  Do you know, I just now realized that the Lockhorns,  is named because they lock horns.  No, you didn't just realize that.  I swear to you.  See, because you'd have to be a complete retard.  I never understood that that meant the Lockhorns.  You know when you lock horns, you're arguing?  I never got that.  I swear to you.  What did you think?  That was just their last name?  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  My favorite was Family Circus.  It wasn't really a circus, though.  Or a family.  That guy was a kidnapper and a pederast.  He ran the biggest pedophile site in eastern Sweden.  The little lad was always trying to find his way home.  Oh.  All right.  Very good.  We got one more thing to do here.  This is a very...  This is one of my favorite stories of the last few months.  Right here.  Right here.  This is what you get.  I saved this for this very moment. 
[03:27:00]  It's a lottery story unlike so many others, where chance was followed quickly by fate,  and grief gave way to an amazing discovery.  That's Charlotte Peters, and that's a golden lottery ticket she almost threw away.  Her husband had bought it a couple of months ago, but died of a heart attack that same day,  never knowing the ticket was a big winner.  My husband had purchased it on November 1st, and he had a heart attack on November.  November 1st, and... 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  You keep believing in your God.  My God got the ticket first.  He bought the winning ticket.  And then dropped the same.  What are the odds of that?  It'd be fucking 10 to 1.  Where's our math majors out there?  What are the odds?  Figure out the math on that equation.  Winning lottery ticket, dead from a heart attack, same fucking day.  That's a mucky lottery lottery.  Yeah, absolutely.  And this was drawn on the 2nd of December. 
[03:28:00]  His wife didn't know it was a winner either, and put the ticket aside during weeks of mourning until just recently.  I was on the verge of drawing it out, and I was in the grocery store, and I asked to have it checked,  and they told me I was a winner.  I had no idea how much it was.  She now knows that ticket is worth $10 million.  Donald Peters was a retired factory worker and had been playing the lottery regularly for 20 years.  Oh.  20 years. 
[03:28:30]  He buys the winning $10 million ticket and drops dead.  He never knew it.  And he never knew it.  That's the key, because that could cause a heart attack going, holy shit, I won.  Could get your ticker going a little too fast, right?  That poor bastard.  That's right.  Sam, smacking Eric is ready if you want to hear it one more time.  All right.  One more time.  How amazing is that story right there, though?  That is.  That sucks.  Yeah.  That's a unlucky lottery slash sucks to be you slash God doesn't like you story. 
[03:29:00]  It's common, though.  There is no God.  I'm a man like you.  I'm a man like you.  My name's Fred.  Pat in Tennessee.  Pat.  Good evening.  Good evening, Pat.  What's up?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I can't wait to see you down there in Miami on the 28th.  No, it's the 20th.  Oh, the 20th?  I thought it was the 20th.  Whatever.  Dunce.  Oh.  Cunt face shit, Dick. 
[03:29:30]  What about this E-Rock that gargles some of that ass spray shit?  Nah, it might get the spray sick.  Nah, it might get E-Rock sick.  We can't do that.  What's the worst that could happen?  He loses more weight?  E-Rock, would you put a few of those on, a few drops on your tongue if it's safe?  No.  If it's safe.  No.  Of course it's not safe.  How do you know?  Let's look at the packaging.  Is it safe?  Yes.  It's not safe or it's labored.  They have to have...  Dude.  It's not safe.  A fine...  Very dangerous.  A fine company like Liquid Ass, they would keep it safe. 
[03:30:00]  Of course.  I mean, if you're trading this on, you know, down there on Wall Street.  What do you got, Sam, on the Liquid Ass?  I think it's safe.  It just says, do not ingest.  If accidentally ingested, drink two glasses of water.  Ah.  So we'll just get some water.  See?  No, they would say, don't make sure you...  Yeah, you can do this.  You don't even have to call it poison control.  Dude, two drops to your tongue.  No.  Two lousy drops.  Two lousy drops. 
[03:30:30]  Two lousy drops.  Or what if you put it on your tongue and then spit it out?  Come on, Iraq.  I tell you, the tongue...  I don't mean the drops.  We'll have water standing by.  Two lousy drops.  Two lousy...  We finally found something you won't do for the show.  No, I won't do that.  What if he just licks the part that it comes out of?  It's just the residue.  It's hot. 
[03:31:00]  How about if he sprays it on his wrist like perfume and then applies it to his neck?  I don't want to fucking smell anymore of this shit.  I understand.  I don't either.  But, you know, we've got to give the people something up there.  I'm thinking...  Two lousy drops.  Iraq.  Not for the mouth.  What?  Putting that stuff in my mouth.  Just like...  You stick your tongue out, Sam.  Drop, drop.  That's it.  And then we watch you lose your fucking mind.  Wouldn't that be great to just put it on your dick and go to a hooker? 
[03:31:30]  It would be better, yeah.  Tell it to give you a head and have her just smelling it.  Dude, he's thinking about it, though.  I've known Iraq long enough to know that he's at least thinking it over in his head.  Why not one lousy drop?  How about...  One lousy drop.  We'll start there.  Because I'm worried about ingesting it.  That's the problem.  Well, we have water standing by.  Look at the label.  Sam, read the label again, please.  Okay, it just says, do not ingest. 
[03:32:00]  If accidentally ingested, drink two glasses of water.  That's it.  What if it's purposely ingested?  That's it.  Drink three glasses.  I don't know.  And they probably mean if you take, like, a shot of it.  Yeah, like...  One drop.  If you just went, drop on your tongue, smush around your mouth, then go, spit it out.  Oh, yeah.  Then you just have the shitty smell in your mouth.  This is a reputable company.  It's called any day of the week.  I'm kidding.  That's not necessary.  One lousy drop. 
[03:32:30]  Always thinking about it.  God, I love this kid.  I love this kid.  You can't say none taken.  I know.  I don't know why I can do that.  Get the video camera.  I don't trust anyone to put that in my mouth.  I will allow you to do your own drop.  It's got to be safe.  But we all will look and go, okay, that was fair.  It's got to be safe.  Everyone has done the eye drop thing, so you pull your tongue out and give yourself a drop.  Water standing by.  Video camera standing by.  Cox out. 
[03:33:00]  Okay, I'm in.  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  All right, Sam is running for the video camera.  This will be part of the E-Rock video series.  I mean, you did the cinnamon challenge.  This is nothing compared to that.  They wouldn't possibly have a product where you could, like, you know, have a real medical issue.  Hey, get E-Rock plenty of water.  And don't take the water away from him. 
[03:33:30]  We've got to play this safe.  That's the dropper.  Have those two.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You want to do it in front of the audience?  Yes.  Well, do you think, hold on, Eric, do you want to hold the water, or do you want Richard  Dreyfuss from Jaws to hold it for you?  Hey, Hooper, hold his water.  All right, E-Rock is a real trooper today. 
[03:34:00]  E-Rock, they've got to see you out there.  Yeah, let's see.  We do the visual bits for the people that are.  They're all guys.  We do it for.  Oh, he just smelled it.  He's not happy.  Is it bad, Eric?  How bad is it?  How bad is that?  It smelled worse, but, like, when you first open it, it's like when you check on a diaper.  It's.  All right.  You want to do it in front of the crowd, E-Rock?  No, screw them.  Yeah, you got it in front of the crowd, sweetie. 
[03:34:30]  We need the audio, sweetie.  Come on, yes.  The audio.  Your fans were waiting.  Of the crowd going, ooh.  Come on.  I'll go over there with you.  Give me a mic.  We'll all go.  Give your whole team thing.  E-Rock.  Jesus.  I need headphones, though.  Yeah.  Head.  Let this asshole go.  All right.  E-Rock, everybody.  One lousy drop. 
[03:35:00]  E-Rock's got the liquid ass.  Liquid ass smells so fucking bad.  All right.  Come on, then.  I don't understand.  Wait, wait.  Let some of the audience smell the liquid ass that haven't smelled it yet.  Just so they understand what the fuck is about to happen here.  Who wants to smell this?  No one.  No, they don't have a choice.  They won't put it.  Don't put it on anybody.  I'm not.  Oh.  Oh, there's a lady here.  He won't spray it on you. 
[03:35:30]  I won't put it on.  You just smell it.  Yeah, this stuff is really, really rancid.  All right, E-Rock.  Can you just get on my way, but you're not...  No, no, no.  It's okay.  Not yet.  It's when Sweetie Pie fucking mopes back in.  I have no idea where the camera is.  All right.  E-Rock.  What are you working on?  A nice drop to the tongue.  Oh, it's bubbling.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's got to be a good one, too. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  Pull your tongue out.  Like, hold your tongue.  No, hold it.  Exactly.  Hold it.  He's wearing a gun.  Dang it.  Pull the tongue out.  All right.  Jimmy, is he doing it?  Tell me when I'm over my tongue.  Well, you can't figure that out?  Stick it out.  One lousy drop to the tongue.  E-Rock, it has entered. 
[03:36:30]  That's his face.  Whoa!  He's not happy.  He's not happy.  There he goes.  His face is beet red.  Holy shit.  You didn't swallow it, did you?  He just fused.  All over the place. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, I hate this.  Holy shit.  He's redder than the cinnamon challenge.  For the people that linger longer with it.  That was one drop.  He's puking a lot.  Oh, God.  I'm the heavy rock. 
[03:37:30]  Holy shit.  I'm all wet.  You all right?  Yeah.  Is the taste still in your mouth?  He boofed so bad.  Is the taste still in your mouth?  Dude, what was it that really got you to puke like that and freak out?  The taste or the smell in your nose?  Is it a pleasant?  Yes.  Um, I pulled my tongue in too fast and it hit, I guess, the rest of the saliva that's in my mouth. 
[03:38:00]  And then I smelt it and I lost it.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Try drinking some more water.  One more drop.  Swallow water.  For the audience, it's like watching Shamu. 
[03:38:30]  Only smaller.  Oh, bigger shit.  Oh.  God, I suck.  I blew that joke.  I was small.  You were right there with radio gold.  I had a good tag and everything.  Now he's smaller.  I fucked it up.  Of course he's smaller.  I suck.  If he wants Shamu, only it's a person, not a whale.  Oh, what a nice suck. 
[03:39:00]  Let's hear it for E-Rock.  Let's hear it, E-Rock.  God damn.  I had a 50-50 shot of getting that right.  Oh my God.  I fucked it up.  Only smaller.  Nice, E-Rock.  Good joke.  My tag was fucking right into the wall.  It suck.  Shit.  Oh.  I thought that made me happy.  It was like shit.  Let me drink this water.  It's like the ocean, only smaller. 
[03:39:30]  Holy shit.  What a complete dick bag.  It was, after that came out, it's unsolvable because there's no way I meant bigger than that.  I know.  We know.  I know.  Everyone knew what I meant.  Oh, that's fucking right.  Dummy I am.  E-Rock, how's it feel?  Perhaps smaller than the whale. 
[03:40:00]  E-Rock, how's it feel?  Oh, great.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's no taste in my mouth, but other than that, it's fine.  You still got the taste of shit in your mouth?  No, it's gone, but I can't taste anything else.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's say hi to Footer.  Uh, Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I'm sure because Eric's gums and that shit, he probably comes out smelling like Scope right 
[03:40:30]  now.  Some weird fucking thing will happen.  And then number second point is...  Number second point?  Wow.  You retards.  A, number second point.  Wow.  Wow.  If I'm being literal, like Anthony, that'll be a little more funny.  Check it out.  Listen to this.  You guys just got through the whole Danny thing, and now, once again, you self-destructive 
[03:41:00]  assholes.  Eric's going to die.  You're going to get fired.  Fuck no, man.  We did our research.  We read the label.  Nah, he's fine.  Look at him.  We read the label.  They would have, like, one of those poison-like things on the fucking product.  They should put that on every bit of food in his fridge.  You don't have to sell me on.  There you go.  Huh?  You don't have to sell me on.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Yes, that's accurate. 
[03:41:30]  Of course it's accurate.  He's supposedly a human being.  Most people would find a human smaller than a whale.  Exactly.  Tor Johnson.  He put a little liquid shit on his tongue and vomited.  God damn.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  I was wondering if anybody caught the reaction of the liquid ass as it hit his tongue. 
[03:42:00]  It must have been horrible.  That's just mean-spirited.  Poor drop of liquid ass having to go into that open fucking canyon of E-Rock mouth.  Ech.  Does your mouth still stink?  I don't know.  Check.  All right.  You know what?  Someone should check, though.  Someone should check.  Sam should check.  Yeah, I think Sam is perfect for the job.  Samikins?  Oh, new viral video.  One guy, one drop.  Barrett from Pittsburgh.  Yes.  That's going to make a good video, man. 
[03:42:30]  That's a good one.  Sam, you got to smell E-Rock's breath.  Don't give him a big whiffy rock because it might still have that stuff on it.  That was one fucking drop, by the way.  There was-  You didn't-  It was just one lousy drop.  We're doing something tomorrow with David and that stuff?  Yeah.  Not yet, E-Rock.  Again?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, no.  We're going to do the big one where he goes and gets shoes.  That's going to be the really good one.  Oh, no.  What?  You put it on his feet?  His old sneakers. 
[03:43:00]  And then you go to a shoe store.  And on his-  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  Okay.  That's a good one.  And on his socks and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  We're going to douse him good and then-  Oh, that's nasty.  I'll buy him new sneakers.  I don't give a shit.  We'll go to that.  Well, when does that happen?  Friday, maybe?  The shoe thing?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah, we'll try for Friday.  Oh, no.  We need you and you might be somewhere.  Maybe Monday.  Speculate, speculate, speculate.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Smell E-Rock's breath.  We got to get out of here.  Okay.  Wow. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, my God.  What happened?  I can't see Sam react like that.  I don't think you got it right.  I agree, E-Rock.  Give me a good whiff.  Yeah, get it.  Get on mic, Sam.  Sam, you all right?  What does it smell like?  Besides the obvious.  Well, it smells like a mixture of David and E-Rock's breath. 
[03:44:00]  Like stale chicken salad sandwiches and shit spray.  It's bad?  Yeah.  It's right, it's bad.  As opposed to good.  Just stale and liquidy and assy.  Yeah.  Did you get a good breathe out of there?  You did a good one, right?  Okay.  The gag reflex is still kicking in. 
[03:44:30]  Want to get a little more?  Because you have to realize he slapped E-Rock twice and E-Rock did the tongue thing.  It's fair, Sam.  It's got to come in three seconds.  Yeah, I think it's fair.  I think so.  That makes sense.  Go on, E-Rock.  It's instant.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Good?  Mm-mm.  No?  No, he's got bad breath. 
[03:45:00]  Really, really bad breath.  He's got an excuse now, though.  That's funny, man.  All right.  It's so funny just to watch somebody retch.  I know.  Why is that hysterical?  There's nothing funnier than watching, like, meh.  Oh, by the way, tomorrow we may have a good friend coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly promoting some shows tomorrow.  Yes.  Make sure we don't get any of those drops near him.  Wow.  That would be a good one.  If we can maybe get a little, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yep.  We've done enough damage for one day. 
[03:45:30]  Yes, we did.  Nice studio audience today.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys.  Yes.  They're building us a new studio as we speak, so this live audience thing, unfortunately,  is going to go away in about a month, maybe less.  So come see the show live.  I don't know the next time we'll be able to do, like, shows in front of people.  All right.  That's it.  Good job.  All right.  We'll join you again.  You know what?  E-Rock takes a lot of abuse in the show, but that fucking guy has never said no.  Have you said no to anything? 
[03:46:00]  I don't think so.  Yes.  I don't think so.  Aside for fuck.  Aside self-control.  Exactly.  I said no to everything.  Food?  Oh, wait.  Exactly.  People talk about the Pat Duffy videos, but E-Rocks are right the fuck up there, man.  Yeah.  That cinnamon challenge is still insane to watch.  Insane.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[03:46:30]  See you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
