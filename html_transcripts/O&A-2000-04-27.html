<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Spike Lee's appearance on "People's Court," the new Godsmack album, and Opie's new computer setup, which facilitated day trading and gaming during the show.  They boasted about their #1 New York ratings.  The conversation segued into anxieties about accidentally exposing offensive material on their shared computer to a female coworker, recalling a previous sexual harassment training video showcasing inappropriate printouts from a shared printer.  A significant portion focused on listener reactions to a previous segment with Jay Moore and dice, including a listener who nearly died from carbon monoxide poisoning due to leaving their car running to avoid missing the show and a coworker's car accident.

The hosts then dissected a New York Post article about the show, focusing on their bosses' negative reactions to photos depicting the hosts looking disheveledâ€”a consequence of celebrating their high ratings the night before.  A humorous, lengthy phone call with their "Southern boss" followed, during which he criticized their appearance, suggesting cowboy hats and hair extensions, and even recommending showering before photoshoots.  The segment included commercial breaks for sponsors like Rockaway Bedding, punctuated by humorous mattress-shopping commentary and listener calls about the Jay Moore segment, the Post article, and the Knicks game.  They also discussed a South Park episode satirizing the Elian Gonzalez case and listener feedback, along with various celebrities, including Star Jones's eating habits and Jay Moore's sitcom.  Their discussion veered into a preference for "trashy" versus "dirty" women, culminating in a description of German fisting videos and Psycho Mark's reaction to one.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Post article and a final listener call.

The next segment centered around a comedic bit featuring the extremely vulgar ventriloquist act "Otto and George," detailing the numerous instances where the broadcast was cut due to offensive content ("dump outs"), and plans to replay the edited version later.  A Priceline.com commercial read devolved into sexually suggestive and offensive jokes.  The New York Post article was again discussed, focusing on on-air personalities Spaz, Stinky, and Psycho Mark, leading to Spaz inadvertently revealing his real name, Kevin Martin, on air.  Crude and sexually explicit jokes followed Mayor Giuliani's prostate cancer diagnosis, revolving around the "use it or lose it" idiom.  The segment included further discussion of Otto and George, their upcoming Rascals performance, past routines, and Rick and Psycho Mark handing out "WOW" stickers at Penn Station.  Listener calls, wrestling event mentions (Stone Cold Steve Austin's potential SmackDown appearance), and a Paisano restaurant live read were interspersed, along with a humorous anecdote about Opie's missing lunch.


Otto and George appeared as in-studio guests, promoting their Rascals performance in West Orange, NJ.  The conversation was characterized by vulgar and offensive humor, profanity, sexually explicit language, and ethnic and racial stereotypes; George's excessive use of the word "pussy" was noteworthy. A call with Congressman Gary Ackerman resulted in further crude jokes. The conversation also touched upon a controversial Columbine video, John McCain's visit to his former POW cell (with George's racist and offensive mimicry), and a listener's claim about Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny opening for Bon Jovi.  Listener calls, discussions about a listener's negative union experiences, and frequent interruptions contributed to the informal, unrestrained tone.


The final segment started with a caller complaining about high union dues, followed by Steve's story about Rosie O'Donnell's alleged erratic behavior. This triggered highly offensive and sexually explicit jokes about Rosie O'Donnell's appearance, sexuality, and parenting, including derogatory remarks about her partners and children.  A Teamster caller, Paul, shared his negative union experience, escalating the offensive tone. The segment descended into chaotic, increasingly lewd and nonsensical exchanges with callers, marked by crude sexual innuendo, homophobic slurs, and other offensive language. The hosts ended with an apology for the last half hour.  Upcoming wrestling events were briefly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Throne men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027-7NEW.  It's the O&A Show.  Hey, thanks for joining us.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  A bunch of people checking in saying that Spike is on people's court.  Yeah, we see.  We see.  We can't put the audio on the radio or anything, but it's pretty damn entertaining. 
[00:00:30]  We're checking it out during the commercials.  Yeah, she's bitching about something.  I wonder if she's going to plug her website or her email at the end of it.  Anyway.  Ooh, Godsmack, Anthony.  I hear that.  You know, they're in the studio this week finishing up recording the follow-up to their self-titled debut CD, Anthony.  You sound like a commercial.  I know.  Well, it's about time, though.  I'm looking forward to hearing new Godsmack.  The album's not going to be out for a while.  They're not going to mix it until June. 
[00:01:00]  So later on this year, you'll hear some new Godsmack.  Yeah.  Of course, the boys hitting the road with the OzFest this summer.  So there you go.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  I got new technology in front of me, Opie.  The days of my laptop are over, it looks like.  I see that.  They got, like, a new computer for me over here.  Remember when we first got here?  I actually, it was like pulling teeth to get a line so I could plug my laptop in over here.  They're like, why would you need that?  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Why do you, the other jocks that have been in NEW for 100 years, they don't need a computer,  is that what it's called?  Yeah, a computer.  And now, look at this.  All of a sudden, I'm hooked up with a Pentium 3 600.  I think you could land airplanes with that setup.  I think you're right.  I got a brand new flat screen display.  Uh-huh.  Full keyboard now, not the laptop thing.  I see that.  I'm scared because I'm convinced you could play Soldier of Fortune during the show now with that. 
[00:02:00]  That's a problem now because all I could do during the day on my laptop here during the show was trade.  Trade and read the instant feedback.  Now I can play my games as the show is going on.  See that.  You completely pay no attention to the program.  A little scary, Anthony.  It is quite frightening.  It's kind of nice when you become number one in New York.  We did?  Yeah.  I didn't notice.  I was trading.  I don't know.  Have you been doing a show here between that?  Was it 2 and 7 or something? 
[00:02:30]  I thought we just came in here to day trade.  I think they're evening out the playing field.  I got the huge, massive desk, and now you got the killer setup over there.  I am hooked up.  I'm trading for other people now.  They're just like calling me with orders, and I'm placing them.  Any flight delays today, Anthony?  Let me see.  No, none at LaGuardia.  Kennedy looks good, but check with your carrier.  All right.  You want to book a flight?  I'm right here.  Look at you.  We got to take a picture of this. 
[00:03:00]  It's hilarious.  It just doesn't look right to have you sitting in front of all that stuff, man.  I got everything, and then I got my sound thing over here.  I got the phone call computer here.  I got my computer over here.  I'm surrounded.  I see that.  Oh, look at that, Opie.  The cold front's moving in from the Gulf.  Can you book, like, vacations through that?  Already did it.  Okay.  We're going to Vegas to see Dice next week, I think.  The only thing that sucks, I got to, like, there's no favorites listed in here, so I 
[00:03:30]  got to remember what all my favorite sites were and go to them.  But this is also the computer that's going to be shared by everyone.  I used to take my laptop out of here when our show was over, and that was it.  Right.  Now, God knows what's going to be on this thing.  I can't...  We watched the sexual harassment video.  Right.  So now what am I supposed to do?  Erase all the porno that I get on this in any given day?  My God, that could take hours.  You better erase it.  You might offend, like, Ron and Fez or something. 
[00:04:00]  Well, I can't see you offending Ron and Fez.  Maybe the chick, because the chick's going to be using this.  The chick.  If all of a sudden the chick comes in and starts pawing through some files, and all  of a sudden something I downloaded pops up there.  You know, that's a fair question.  You want to ask her real fast?  I mean, you know...  I got to know if she's going to be offended by anything, because it does seem to be more  a guy and woman thing, this whole sexual harassment thing.  The Ron and Fez thing, I don't know what the hell they're going to be popping on this.  I, quite frankly, am afraid.  I'm thankful that Ron sits here, and Fez is over on the other side. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Not by this computer, because I'm just frightened to know what he would put on this thing.  Oh, my God.  Tell her we need her right now, though.  She's in the room recording something.  See, she works on her radio show.  Yeah, they actually do things after their show.  Oh, my God.  That is so weird.  Really?  What a concept.  You sure she isn't playing Soldier of Fortune?  That's what I do.  You sure she's not drinking Budweiser in her office?  Drinking beer in the office with everyone else? 
[00:05:00]  Listening to Psycho Mark?  Try to figure out where he's going to smoke his next bone?  They actually work on the show after the show.  That's interesting.  Work on the show after the show.  Very interesting idea.  We work on the show between 3 and 7.  Yeah.  And we've had it.  All right.  Yeah, we've got to find out if she's going to be cool with us, because you guys are sharing the same computer.  Yeah.  And it's public.  We're trying to be a little more sensitive as far as the sexual harassment stuff goes after seeing that fine video that they put together. 
[00:05:30]  Now, wait a minute.  Based on the video, I can tell you that I probably can't look up smart on this thing, because it is a company computer now.  Like, my own computer was fine.  Uh-oh, it's a shared computer.  Yeah.  It's a shared computer.  Remember with the printer?  Remember the episode in the sexual harassment video with the public printer?  Community printer?  A guy printed out a bunch of Viagra jokes.  Yeah.  And the woman came over to the printer as it was printed out.  That was no woman.  I know.  Janet Reno walked over to the computer, the printer, and started picking up the pages. 
[00:06:00]  And she's reading them.  Like, if you go over to the printer and you pick up something and it's not what you printed out, are you going to read through it?  No, of course not.  No.  Twat.  Put it down.  It's not yours.  It's not yours.  I don't look at your goddamn printouts on your hot flashes from your menopause, you beast.  So don't look at my smut jokes that I'm printing out.  Filthy animal.  You need some banana juice. 
[00:06:30]  I'm printing something out over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here.  I got some banana juice for you.  You say what?  Over here.  Right.  Yeah, so that opens up a whole new can of worms.  You know, while we wait for the chick to get in here, take your time, chick.  It's not like, you know, we're doing a radio show or anything.  Thank you.  You know the pressure of, like, killing time live on the air.  No problem.  Killing time.  We'll make it work.  But that whole dice thing yesterday? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Man, that was huger than huge.  The best email we got about it, and we got, I don't know, probably close to 1,000 people  had something to say about the Jay Moore dice thing from yesterday.  Yeah, very funny.  You got to tell them the one you read, Anthony.  Anthony, a guy was writing in from his house.  He had listened to us on the way home, pulled into his garage, and couldn't shut the car  off.  He didn't want to shut it off because even the second that you shut your car off and 
[00:07:30]  the radio comes back on, he didn't want to miss something.  So he left the car running.  Well, and a lot of people said that yesterday.  I couldn't get out of my car.  I had to go into a deli.  I didn't go into the house for dinner or whatever.  Yeah.  I drove around the neighborhood an extra half hour just to hear it.  So that was normal.  But this guy took it a little too far.  This guy almost killed his family.  He almost caused the death of an entire family.  With the dice, Jay Moore bit.  Yeah.  He's in his garage with his car running.  And finally, his wife, like all beet-eyed, big red, like bloodshot eyes, comes staggering 
[00:08:00]  into the garage and yelling at him, shut the car off.  You're killing us.  Almost toy, like killed his whole family.  Carbon monoxide poisoning.  Yeah.  She ran out and said, hey, man, the carbon monoxide is leaking into the house now.  What are you doing to us?  Now, that would have been good.  And then, yeah, Lisa and Sales from upstairs, she said she rear-ended a Dodge Durango in  Jersey.  I thought the guy was looking.  All right.  Well, where's the chick?  And it was a rent-a-car, so it's even better.  Tell the chick it's been two minutes, and we're filling best we can, but we want to 
[00:08:30]  get this.  No car takes a hit as good as a rent-a-car.  You could read all the stats.  Rent-a-car takes more abuse than anything.  Right.  Remember that one I rented out in California?  I rented the convertible Mustang.  I saw that, and for WrestleMania.  I don't think the gas pedal was off the floor for more than like five minutes the whole  weekend.  Like any time I took off from a light.  It's a rental. 
[00:09:00]  Who cares?  You know?  Yeah.  Because who cares?  Convertible's down.  Yeah.  I like seeing dips in the road.  All four tires off the ground.  Who cares?  A rental.  Well, well, we're waiting.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll get the radio chick in here.  We'll solve the problem with this computer you and her will be sharing.  And also, we're going to talk about the post article next.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems like they wrote a little article about Ant and I and everyone on the show, and it 
[00:09:30]  was really interesting.  We'll have our comments.  And the Southern boss called us about the article.  This guy now won't leave us alone.  I think it's like, I would hazard to say, I think he's almost amused by the whole thing  now.  Yeah.  Now he just calls us every day because he knows we're going to mock him, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because everyone wants to be famous, let's face it, you know.  I want airtime.  Yeah.  He's getting his airtime.  Who?  We spasping on more than me, didn't we?  So, it's pretty funny the stuff he was. 
[00:10:00]  He's the new Earl.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny the stuff he was saying to us before the show today.  I guess Ant and I have to work on our image if we're going to be in the public eye  is the gist of what I got out of the conversation.  We're not upholding the corporate image or something.  Is anybody ever happy with anything?  Yeah.  So, we'll get into that next, okay?  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Hug your butt.  Hug your butt.  Hug your butt.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity is on the way. 
[00:10:30]  102.7 WM-E-W.  Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Yes.  I love Rockaway Bedding.  You will, too.  You need a bed?  130 stores throughout New York, New Jersey.  Brand name Mattresses, Sealy Serta, Stearns & Foster.  Prices up to 65% department store, regular prices.  Why do you want to go to a department store, try to pick out a mattress with a sales guy  that doesn't care?  He's, like, in there temporarily.  He was in pots and pans yesterday.  Now he's selling you a mattress.  He don't know beds.  He doesn't know beds.  He was in hardware. 
[00:11:00]  He was trying to sell you a ratchet.  That's right.  I'll wrap your head in with a ratchet.  That's right.  Rockaway Bedding.  More better.  Yeah.  Rockaway Bedding.  More better.  It's more good-er-er than going to a department store where they're not as good-er-er than  Rockaway Bedding.  I need a box in a donut.  Box in.  Sorry.  A box in spring for my mattress.  Yeah, they're experts.  That's all they do, mattresses and bedding.  There you go.  You go into one of their stores, like I said, over 130 of them throughout New York and New 
[00:11:30]  Jersey.  Pick out your own mattress.  You lay there.  You talk with the guy.  65%.  You could go to sleep.  Spend the weekend.  See how it is.  They love that.  You talk to the sales guy.  You figure out the best bed for you.  They love when you try to have sex on the bed right in front of everyone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just go in there.  Take some chicken and really give the bed a workout.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You might as well.  You got to know if it's a squeaky one, so your neighbors are going to be disturbed  downstairs, right?  How embarrassing is that?  Sure. 
[00:12:00]  All you're hearing is the squeaking of your mattress.  I bought a mattress at the department store, and I didn't know when I'm with my chick that  the downstairs is hearing.  Oh, no.  I should have went to Rockaway Bedding.  They're the experts.  And then you're at the department store.  The guy from hardware sells you the mattress, and then they give you the rope to tie it to  the roof of your Pinto, and then you're driving down the road with this mattress with your 
[00:12:30]  arm out the window trying to hold on to it, and your arms go, yeah, oh, like if the rope  snaps, you're going to be able to hold the mattress.  No, your arm and the mattress are going to be out on the expressway.  It's a big pain in the ass.  So what you do, Rockaway Bedding, they remove the old bedding, deliver the new bedding,  give you a free steel bed frame, free delivery, complete removal of your old bedding.  You'll love it.  Rockaway Bedding, the official provider of mattresses for Anthony and Jay Moore.  Give them a call.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED. 
[00:13:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way.  Stay there.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I used to love this song, I got to admit.  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  Not everything has to be rocking your face, I guess.  Hey, Ant.  Yeah, new slogan for the show.  What's that?  It'll make sense to some people out there.  Syndication.  Underground.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Syndication. 
[00:13:30]  Underground.  Underground.  Want to say hi to all our affiliates out there.  Underground.  Underground.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Well, I was pretty excited to wake up this morning and see that huge article in the Post.  Anthony, what about you?  Pretty nice.  It was very nice.  Want to thank John Minnelli.  I have to admit, I think he did a pretty good job with the article.  Yeah.  About 90% of it is accurate. 
[00:14:00]  That's not too bad.  Yeah.  I guess he was taking comments off the air.  Yeah.  I thought we were saying on the air.  We were misquoted a couple times, but whatever.  We'll let it slide.  Nothing big, though.  Nothing big enough to cause a stink, but, well, not with normal people.  For some reason, there were some issues with our big boss down there in Washington.  Well, yeah.  Well, let's explain.  First of all, if you haven't checked it out yet, please pick up the Post.  We're pretty proud of the article. 
[00:14:30]  It says, Risque Radio rocks.  Beer and Babes routines put N.E.W.'s Toxic Twins on a ratings rocket ride.  Toxic Twins.  They do say some really nice things in this article, though, and they justify what we  do as art, Anthony.  Yeah, great.  Art.  Could you borrow the leaf and showered before the photo shoot?  All right, wait.  Let me explain. 
[00:15:00]  This is what we heard right around 1 o'clock today.  We came in very proud.  The article was copied and put in everyone's mailbox that works for the radio station, you  know?  And you think, you know, an article comes out in the paper and it's a cool thing for  a radio show.  But the things that go on behind the scenes are just hysterical.  Yeah.  Like the article is picked apart by the corporation.  Yes.  Corporate picks it apart for every little thing to weigh it to see if it's a good article or  bad.  It might look like a great article on the outside. 
[00:15:30]  Sure.  To a person that picks the paper up and reads it.  But when it's run in front of lawyers and corporate suits and PR people and everything,  oh my God, it could be a catastrophe.  Yes.  And well, the Southern boss down there in Washington had some problems with this article that's  in the Post today.  I didn't have any problem with it.  Oh, you didn't?  Not one problem.  No?  Well, we explained yesterday that we were hungover when they came in to take these pictures. 
[00:16:00]  We're wearing the same clothes from the night before because we're staying in the city.  I was wearing the toilet bowl because, for the love of God, I ain't never seen something  like that.  You're representing CBS Broadcasting. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  That is a company that has been around for many years.  Right.  Long before and long after you two will be at the door.  Right.  CBS was going on.  Represented by the likes of Mike Wallace and the crew of 60 Minutes.  You heard of them, huh?  Yes, I did.  Now, when you tune in 60 Minutes, does Mike Wallace look like he's been running a marathon  and didn't show her?  Well... 
[00:17:00]  No!  Mr. Wallace is in a suit and tie.  He looks respectable for the company.  Well, but the night before the picture was taken, we were celebrating our great ratings  with our listeners.  I don't care about your ratings.  The picture's a goddamn disgrace.  I'm wearing the same clothes from the night before, the same clothes I had on in the strip  club.  I noticed that.  I saw some pictures from the day before.  You didn't even change for the photoshoot.  No, I did not.  Now, I want you boys to sit down with our promotion department, our public relations.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  And they will teach you the right way to be dressed and speak at a press conference.  Yeah.  Now, I understand you're not the run-of-the-mill show.  So you could be a little, what you call wacky or zany.  Maybe we'll give you a big cowboy hat.  Wouldn't that be good now, a good image or gimmick of being, if you're sired, and put  on a cowboy hat and maybe a bandana around your neck.  So you're suggesting we get rid of the baseball caps and we go with the cowboy hat.  Cowboy and baseball cap, you look like you're ready to go out on the subway wilding. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  Wilding.  But that's us, you know.  What are we, a cow-land shopping, school drivers, asking people for money?  No.  You work for the company.  Well, you don't pay us enough.  We've got to make up the money somehow.  Or maybe if you're looking for a cool image, every picture they take of you could have sunglasses on.  You're not going to...  And how about hair extensions?  Hair extensions.  If you want to be cool with the young crowd, you could have long hair extensions. 
[00:18:30]  That might get the younger, you know, people to look at you like, well, no, then you just  look like someone's father with hair extensions.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, boys, you've got to work on something.  Well, you...  And speaking of the baseball cap, Opie...  Yeah.  I'm addressing you right now.  Yeah.  Did you have to wear an FBA baseball cap?  I don't think I was a TBS, I want to be, I have all personalities, with a goddamn FBA cap on. 
[00:19:00]  And what does FBA stand for, sir?  Full-blown age, you idiot!  How do you know that?  Sir, in my defense, that's not an FBA hat.  It looks like it.  It says BA at the end, but it's NBA.  I'm up.  Okay, Mr. Genius, what matters, what it really says or what it looks like in the goddamn  newspaper?  But it clearly looks like an NBA hat, which it is.  I'm a huge basketball fan, it says NBA, not FBA.  There was a picture of Mayor Julianne in the paper a few months back. 
[00:19:30]  Remember this one?  Yeah.  Where he was visiting a little elementary school.  Sure.  And he was kissing one of the little children.  That's right.  A sweet panda picture, very innocent.  Right.  The picture looked like it was squeezing her gas.  Did anyone say, look at the mayor, kissing the little child?  No.  He said, look at the child touching mayor.  Don't matter what you're doing, don't matter the hat, don't say FBA. 
[00:20:00]  Okay, you fresh little bastard.  Don't you smutin' at me, boy.  I'll have you go out and cut a switch.  Well, why aren't you making fun of Anthony in the photo there?  The photo does enough make in front of him that I can't even elaborate on that.  A WOW sticker.  Yeah.  One of them WOW stickers.  Oh, that's good for the company.  Well, we're proud of the WOW, and that's the brand new sticker.  Yeah, there's a picture of it in the post today.  A shower would have been nice for him, too.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe even a bath in acetone or something.  Goddamn, does he look greasy.  Well, we try to explain it.  Two words.  Hygiene.  Well, we try to explain it to you.  We were out late the night before.  We didn't shower.  That's the same clothes we had on at the strip club.  We try to explain that to the post, but they still wanted the pictures.  And then not only the pictures, but the goddamn text of the article.  Yeah, yeah.  CBS loves having the toxic twins on their roster. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, what a collection of characters that have not been approved by this company.  What?  Spaz, Stinky, and Psycho Mark?  Yeah, they're a big part of the radio show.  Oh, and how about Kobe, Roy, and Annette?  What is this, the goddamn Mouseketeers?  Manny, Moe, and Jack.  What's the problem with having guys work on the show that are called Stinky, Spaz, and Psycho Mark?  Well, next corporate meeting, you could go to the big boss of bosses for this company 
[00:21:30]  and say, oh, would you like to come by our radio station that you own  and meet some of the people that work here?  Oh, what's their names?  Bob, Bill, Peacock?  No, Spaz, Stinky, and Psycho Mark.  You'd be out the door.  I don't care what the hell your ratings are.  You're high on yourself down there, ain't you?  So I'm assuming you didn't like the article today in the post.  Well, you know something?  And you aren't professional enough in the corporate industry 
[00:22:00]  to realize and assess these articles for what they're worth.  This is detrimental to the company.  And, Opie, is there one picture of you with your goddamn mouth shut?  Opie, you've got your mouth hanging like a basset hound every time I see you in the paper.  Well, I was broadcasting.  I was in the middle of saying something.  Broke, is that what you call it?  Yeah.  I was in the middle of saying something wacky.  Wacky, zany.  Zanerific, yes.  Well, if you want to go that route, just come to us before these articles come out, 
[00:22:30]  before the photographer gets there.  We've got ideas.  We'll put you two in a dress.  That'll be great.  We'll dress you up in a dress and lipstick.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And I don't do dresses.  You'll do whatever the hell we tell you.  Don't talk back to me.  I came to your head.  I don't care what your ratings are.  Out the door.  Right through a goose.  That quick. 
[00:23:00]  That quick it'll happen.  I thought you said we were very talented people.  Look, I'll say it again.  Okay.  You're a very talented boy.  That's why we brought you on board.  Even after that Boston debacle.  We'll bring you on board.  We saw raw talent.  But, God damn, you screw up one more time by showing up in the paper like a couple of ragamuffins,  you'll be out the door.  You're representing CBS and Infinity Broadcaster. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  You can't be in a major metropolitan newspaper looking like a couple of slides.  So you're suggesting, like, cowboy hats and maybe some hair extensions.  Yeah, that might work.  That might work.  Cowboy hats and hair extensions.  All right.  A bandana.  Yeah.  Around your neck.  Yeah.  That might work.  All right.  And Anthony.  Oh, no.  Anthony.  Razors.  You ever heard of that?  Razors. 
[00:24:00]  It's called shaving.  Look in it.  All right, sir.  Just doing the best we can.  And I don't like that wow sticker none much.  No, why?  What's the problem?  Well, it's got the big wow on it.  Sure.  The wow should be the little thing in the corner, and 1027 WNAW should be the big thing.  How the hell are they going to know where to find you if all they see is wow?  They'll be turning around the stage and going, oh, where's W-O-W?  Where's the station?  W-O-W.  You're a couple of idiots.  Filthy, disgusting, greasy idiots. 
[00:24:30]  I believe you approved the sticker, sir.  Oh, I did?  Yeah.  There's a brilliant sticker over here.  You boys got to learn how to address the media.  We've been doing this for years.  For years.  Ever since the 40s, when CBS first went on there.  You never saw a famous newscaster with a goddamn baseball cap on. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, here's the news.  Here's the news on my chair this week.  And here's my tuberculosis hat.  No, it's an NBA hat.  I told you that already.  NBA, tuberculosis, whatever that, cancer.  NBA.  It doesn't say FBA.  It just looks like it says FBA.  You never see them do an article on 10-10 wins and have some of the news people up there  with the goddamn hats on. 
[00:25:30]  Hi, hi, traffic and weather on the ones.  Look at me.  I'm a greasy mess.  Well, I thought you would like the article today, sir, but I guess not.  John Montone, where's the bathtub?  You never see that.  You boys are a disgrace to this company.  Goddamn.  Anthony looked like something out of Planet of the Apes. 
[00:26:00]  Give him a goddamn razor.  Cut the facial hair a little bit.  And Opie with his goddamn supriless hat.  It's an NBA hat.  NBA, I don't care what the hell it is.  Yeah, we love you representing the company with a disease hat.  That's good.  Look what you got planned next week.  A sweater with genital herpes written on it?  Yeah, send it to New York Times to photograph that one.  It's an NBA hat. 
[00:26:30]  N-B-A.  Goddamn geniuses.  Yes.  Well, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I've been with the company years and I'm wrong.  You boys have got to be right.  Well, next time I'll try to get new clothes on at least.  Fresh clothes.  I've got a little question for you.  Let's get a little intelligence quiz on you.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  What do you open in a house that is glass and lets the air in?  A window?  A window. 
[00:27:00]  Very good.  What's on top of the house to keep the rain from coming in?  A roof?  A roof, right.  And where do the people, the guests, knock on when they're there?  The door?  The door.  And what the hell is your ass going to be thrown through if you screw up again?  The goddamn door.  You don't understand.  I'm surprised that looking at these pictures, the photographer was able to get close enough to you.  Why?  You're wearing the same clothes as they're not before.  I'm sure they smell like whore. 
[00:27:30]  That's good.  Yeah, we got a photo shoot with a major metropolitan newspaper.  But what are we doing not before?  Go out, get liquor, and whore it up.  That's brilliant.  Looking good, boys.  Looking good.  Jesus Christ, what are you going to do for your first TV appearance?  No address them?  Well, he won't be wearing any dresses.  I can promise you that.  Now, that's a funny, wacky thing.  You boys don't understand.  I understand you're a comedy show. 
[00:28:00]  You've got to come to us when you want to be funny, when you want to get a public image of wackiness and vaininess.  We'll even give you...  Now, I know some other people in the company wear the cowboy hat.  And a couple other people maybe use the higher extensions.  But what you've got to do, maybe you could wear a 10-gallon hat with higher extensions out the back.  Now, that's...  Wait a minute, hold on.  God damn, I cracked myself up. 
[00:28:30]  I should be on that.  You should put me on your show.  God damn.  Well, you've been on a lot lately, sir.  That would be the perfect image, huh?  In your eyes?  Now, that's funny.  Okay.  It's not tasteless.  And maybe...  You know what?  Huh?  You come to my office down in Washington, or maybe even get over that Black Rock there in New York.  But they have sharks.  Some running water over your body before a photo shoot.  Is that too much to ask? 
[00:29:00]  Okay, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Are we on the same page?  Yeah, we're on the same page.  Thank you, sir.  We're very proud of you, boy.  Yeah, I know.  You've done very well in the ratings.  Very talented.  Very talented.  Very good for the company.  Yes.  But you will be out that door so quick.  Crap through a goose.  You won't even know what hit you.  You've been standing out on 57 going, God damn, what happened?  I had a job a minute ago, but I don't now. 
[00:29:30]  We had high ratings.  What happened?  And then maybe one of you will have a divine thought and say, we didn't listen to our boss.  God damn, now we're out of a job.  Don't let that happen, boy, because we think you're going to last long with the company.  All right, sir.  Not if you keep pulling these shenanigans.  Okay, thank you, sir.  And, Anthony, Anthony, sop!  Sop!  It's an easy word.  It's a four-letter word that don't start with F.  Sop.  Use it. 
[00:30:00]  Okay.  And a funny man, Anthony, I hear you're doing impressions of me.  That's real funny.  Let me hear it.  Go ahead.  Let me hear it.  See, he ain't even got the balls to do it in front of me, does he?  I dare you.  Go ahead.  You ain't even talking, are you?  You're not pushing.  See, I could be wacky.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  That's pretty much what we heard before the show today.  Go ahead and check out the article for yourself.  It's in the post. 
[00:30:30]  John Minnelli.  In the TV section.  I don't know why, but it's in the TV section.  Oh, God damn.  In from the back.  Go to the sports section.  It's what, three pages in or something like that?  Oh, no.  God damn toxic twins.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you, certain?  Think you're a goddamn superhero?  Toxic twins' powers activate.  Form of an effing idiot.  That's what you are.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Stu and Pip. 
[00:31:00]  The toxic twins.  Yeah, well.  More checks in that stupid column.  More checks.  You have opportunity after opportunity to put checks in the smart column.  Like other people that work for this company.  But no.  Look, look.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.  Smart column.  Nothing.  Nothing yet.  Nothing.  Well, God damn.  All right, boys.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  Keep up doing this.  Bad work.  Syndication never, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever, ever, ever, and then add a day.  Syndication underground.  Syndication underground.  I know what you're talking about.  Syndication underground.  Syndication never, ever, ever.  All right, sir.  We've got to move on with the show.  It was great talking to you.  Bye, bud.  Okay.  There he goes.  Whoa.  The southern boss.  He was very angry.  Now we have to work on our image.  Our image. 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  Stop.  All right.  We have to take a quick break here.  Billy and Paul from airsick.net sent a little ditty about cranky ass as we go to spots.  Let's play it.  It's pretty funny.  All right?  And we'll be back.  Cranky ass.  You got a smelly little cranky ass.  You got a nugget and some skidmark wares.  Cranky ass. 
[00:32:30]  Caught your ass to sticky.  We should do some better.  Wanky cranky ass.  Thanks to Cowbell Bill for this time we all embrace.  You're such a giant ass.  Cause you keep passing gas.  Of your stinky cranky ass.  Hey ass.  Turn down your radio.  Go Knicks go. 
[00:33:00]  Go Knicks go.  Go Knicks go.  Anthony were you watching the Knicks game last night?  Oh I was riveted.  Glued to the TV.  What an exciting finish there Anthony.  Oh I am.  Yeah.  Do you know who won Anthony?  Uh the Knicks.  Very good.  50-50 shot.  50-50 shot for you.  I was on the edge of my seat.  Latrell Sprewell made Vince Carr look like a chump at the end of the game there.  Big win for the Knicks last night. 
[00:33:30]  That was the only time they had the lead too.  The whole game.  Oh yeah?  Oh sorry I'm talking to a wall.  I didn't notice that.  I wonder how I missed that part of the program.  Big comeback in the fourth quarter Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sprewell pretty much taking the team on his back.  One by one point.  That was the first time they took the lead in the entire game.  I just liked when he choked that guy. 
[00:34:00]  See you know what's so funny?  This guy could be the best basketball player in the world.  The only way I really know of him is that he choked the guy.  His old coach.  Isn't that sad?  Because there's so much more to Latrell Sprewell.  I don't know.  If you get to know him you'll love him.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  What did you do last night instead of watch the Knick game?  I think I was having sex.  I don't know.  That's a good excuse.  It was your birthday.  Yeah how was your birthday last night?  Very nice.  Thank you Wopi. 
[00:34:30]  Good.  I know Latrell Sprewell because I went to that one Knicks game.  He's the guy that looks like he should be in a lineup right?  Right?  I mean out of all the players.  You're busting on him.  He looks like the guy that should be standing in front of the wall with the lines and the height markers.  You're busting on Latrell man.  Latrell.  Latrell.  Latrell.  But doesn't he?  You're busting on Spree yo.  Spree yo.  I don't know if he turns black. 
[00:35:00]  Come on.  You know I hate that show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire but they're doing a great little commercial with that.  Have you seen that part?  No.  It shows Regis right?  Yeah.  They did this at the Garden Sunday when I was there.  The place went nuts.  They show Regis.  He reads the question.  Who will represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals?  And it gives Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks, the 76ers.  Yeah.  And I forget the last one. 
[00:35:30]  Detroit or something right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you now see the contestant at the back of his head.  And you can't really tell who he is yet.  It's Marcus Camby.  Yeah.  And he goes.  Oh see I knew that.  And he goes New York Knicks.  And then Regis goes.  Is that your final answer?  And that's when they finally show Marcus Camby.  Yeah.  And he goes that's my final answer.  When they did that at the Garden Sunday the place just went nuts.  That's your final answer.  It's a pretty.  Marcus Cannabis.  It's a pretty funny little spot.  But you know like Regis did it for all the teams that are in the Eastern Conference I'm sure. 
[00:36:00]  Oh yeah.  I'm sure.  You go to their venue and that's the one that's playing.  You go to Philadelphia and it's probably like Allen Iverson answering the question.  And then you know.  Allen Iverson.  Yeah.  And then he like ties it up in a little joke.  Hey Marcus the check's in the mail.  Didn't he say that?  Hey Allen Iverson can answer that question.  Oh my God.  They're abusing Allen Iverson behind me.  Sorry.  Doesn't Regis do that as the little joke at the end?  Hey Marcus the check's in the mail.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  And I won't unload in your mouth.  What the hell man?  Hey.  Those are the biggest lies.  Do you know what happened with.  The check's in the mail and I won't.  Do you know what happened with.  I know.  I know.  I think everyone gets it.  Well no.  You look boggled.  I was.  I can't believe you said that.  Come on.  What happened with South Park?  I'm getting a lot of email.  I was too busy watching the Knick game.  All right.  I'm watching South Park last week. 
[00:37:00]  And they do a little promo after the show for the one that was going to air last night.  And it's about these little girls from Romania that are over there.  And they really didn't get into the plot last week.  But I watched it last night.  It was totally the Elion Gonzalez storming of the house and taking Elion thing.  They played it perfectly.  At one point the guy the INS guy comes into the house opens the closet and there's this guy holding Cartman. 
[00:37:30]  And it's the same shot.  It's the same friggin shot.  That's bizarre.  And then Kenny was over in Romania singing.  And since they're all poor over there their family would do really well there so they were going to live there.  But then Kenny's father was still in America and demanded that his son be returned.  And so the troopers went in to get Kenny and they opened the closet and there he is.  But the guy just unloads in Kenny and shoots him full of holes. 
[00:38:00]  It was great.  And the Janet Reno is just fantastic.  The animated South Park Janet Reno.  Yeah.  Just a man.  Oh, man.  But they threw it together.  I would love to know how they did this.  Because they put it together in a week's time.  Mark, what's going on?  Dude, I was going to say the same thing.  The Janet Reno was hysterical.  I think it was the same voice as the mad scientist.  It was the deep guy voice.  And Janet Reno dressed up like the Easter Bunny because they were standing in the house on Easter Sunday. 
[00:38:30]  So Janet dressed up as the Easter Bunny with some tear gas Easter eggs.  It was so funny because the Easter egg pops in and you just hear the father go, O.S.  Yeah.  And then all the troopers come in with their guns.  And they're all wearing the goggles and the helmets and stuff.  It was great.  They threw that together in, like, no time.  I heard I missed a good one.  I would love to know, like, how they were able to put that together so quick.  And if they even had an inkling that they were going to do it last week.  Right.  They couldn't have because they didn't know what was going to happen. 
[00:39:00]  It was really funny, though.  Cool.  That show has gotten funnier.  Kenny.  The retired kid.  Thank you, Mark.  Yeah.  Kenny.  Reno.  Reno.  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  Go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  Daylight come and he's going to go. 
[00:39:30]  Hundred men and they all got guns.  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  She's going to reunite the dad with son.  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  Oh, come on now, Miss Reno.  Tell us that it ain't so.  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  Oh, come on now, Miss Reno. 
[00:40:00]  Did you make up for Waco?  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  Go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  He will go.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Daylight come and he's going to go home.  Ah, yes.  Billy and Paul from airsick.net.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Get Jennifer.  And Reno tune.  Yeah.  Elyon Gonzalez.  As we're talking about the Elyon Gonzalez thing, really fast, I guess everyone has seen 
[00:40:30]  the what's up thing by now.  Do we have that on the unofficial website?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, okay.  With all the principal characters from all the pictures, they just kind of animated their  mouths and they're all doing the wah-zah.  Wah-zah.  Wah-zah.  It is hilarious.  If you haven't seen it yet, go to foundrymusic.com.  I believe we have a copy up there, okay?  Yeah.  Let's see.  John from Rockland sat courtside and saw Star Jones with Samuel Jackson.  Star doesn't look very fat in person. 
[00:41:00]  Stop it.  What, are you kidding me?  Just stop.  You sure you weren't in the back row?  Samuel L. Jackson.  God damn, woman.  I've never seen no one eat like that.  And those garden seats are tiny, too.  Imagine you get the season tickets, you're finally on the floor, you've been trying to  get, you know, floor tickets for 25 years and finally you get them and you have to sit  next to that.  Put down the mother effing burger.  Her left cheek is on your seat. 
[00:41:30]  What are you eating, Star?  Is that a big Kahuna burger?  It's a Royal.  Mind if I have some of your tasted beverage?  Say what?  One more time, you fat bitch.  One more time.  Claire, what's going on?  You guys, I just want to say that was the funniest song you just put on.  Yeah.  All right.  The Janet Reno.  Very good.  Yeah, got to give props there.  Sick.net.  She's a man. 
[00:42:00]  She's definitely a man.  All right.  And it's a big conspiracy.  Yeah.  I think Ileon should stay.  Yes.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  Thank you, Claire.  Wow.  Look at that.  Well, the Daily News, Russia Malloy there, kind of the Hollywood what's going on page.  Mm-hmm.  Everybody they show here, all the actors and just people with their girls, except Kevin Spacey.  He's with Alec Baldwin. 
[00:42:30]  You know, he's going to be starring in the Pink Panther soon.  Really?  Right.  He's going to be starring in the Pink Panther, Kevin Spacey.  Did they change the storyline around and just use the name?  Pink Panther.  I don't know if it was the pink.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  And as we're doing Hollywood News here, too, our buddy, our pal, you know him, you love  him, Jay Moore, got some great news today.  They're picking up his failed sitcom, FX. 
[00:43:00]  What failed sitcom?  Well, it failed, but, I mean, the critics loved it.  Failed.  But, like Dice said yesterday.  Are they picking up hits?  Right.  Like Dice said yesterday, face it, it failed.  But FX is going to run 13 episodes of action and will air the five unseen episodes this summer.  Ah.  Ah.  Very, very good news.  Jay making some cash for that, I guess.  Um.  Yeah, knowing him, sure.  But it's a critically acclaimed show that just, uh, just didn't do too well for Jay.  We're, we're distracted because, uh, he's running the, uh, true Hollywood story with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[00:43:30]  The Dice Man.  Do they say he's from Brooklyn or Jersey?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn, please.  That was so much fun yesterday.  Brooklyn part of Jersey.  Don't say anything bad.  He'll be on that phone again.  Yeah, he'll call.  You know how he gets.  All right.  What's this?  Chick Carson's banging now.  God, is he getting some quality quim?  Quim.  Quim.  Let me see.  Tara Reid. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Oh.  Uh.  Why?  You don't think she's hot?  She's all right.  Dude, get out of town.  She's all right.  She's not Jennifer Love.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Not Jennifer Love.  I don't know.  I mean, the girl's not.  The girl's not ugly.  I mean, you know, I throw some banana juice at her, but.  Banana juice.  I think she's better than Jennifer Love.  Tell you the truth.  This girl?  Yeah.  What?  Jennifer Love's getting a little wacky in the face, dude.  You gotta admit.  It was all kind of cute and stuff when she was in her teens.  I was never into the Jennifer Love. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  I hope we never really into Jennifer Love.  Not sloppy enough.  Really?  You need a little slop.  Just a little.  A little slop.  A little, you know.  Yeah, but that's just it.  You're into Courtney Love and stuff.  Yeah, I'm into the Courtney Love, the Drew Barrymore.  Drew Barrymore.  They have a little slop to them.  Like flab ass, though.  Well, you don't have to look at the butt if you don't have, you know.  If you love Verne DeFazio.  Yeah, that's me, Anthony.  Pinky Tuscadero.  Vodio Dodo. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  There's some slop for you.  Roseanne?  Roseanne, of course.  There's some slop.  Yeah, let's take it, you know, out of context.  Of course.  I don't know.  It's me.  Courtney Love.  Yeah.  They always come across as Star Jones.  Yeah.  Always come across as just, I don't know, dirty.  You wouldn't bang Courtney?  Just looks like it would open up and be all dirty.  She's all scabbed up.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with a little scab.  Like all scabby and filthy. 
[00:45:30]  She doesn't mind getting dirty.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Go out with one of these supermodels.  They don't want to get dirty.  They don't want you messing up anything, man.  You need a girl that can go.  Yeah, but you don't want, like, stench.  Set a little mud on those knees.  You don't want a stench.  I know all the guys that banged Courtney Love.  We're not talking like I actually have a chance.  It's the dream world.  Well, looking at that list, you might.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I don't mind, like, sleazy, like slutty and stuff.  But when they look dirty, like, it just looks like you'd open that up and just go like,  Oh, whoa.  Wow.  That's really bad, you know?  You just get some clothespins for the nose.  Yeah, because maybe you wouldn't be doing that anyway.  Let me look.  Yeah, I got the cover here.  Celebrity skin.  She wasn't bad on the cover of Celebrity Skin.  Some of those videos from that album, she was, she was, come on. 
[00:46:30]  You wouldn't, you wouldn't go there?  Yeah, you open that up.  It just looks like a crime scene.  Police tape.  Oh, just, oh my God, what happened here?  Someone, please call the authorities.  Someone dial 911.  Scout, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  What's up?  Talking to you.  I just want to tell you guys, oh, I totally agree.  Trashy chicks are the best. 
[00:47:00]  I mean, some, they have a certain charm.  You just want to grab them, bend them over a table, and, you know, say, oh, this one's for you.  Yeah, but trashy is one thing.  But she looks dirty.  Like there's going to be dirt.  Like it's just going to be all, like, discolored.  You know what I mean?  Turn off the lights.  Turn out the lights.  Yeah, well, you throw her in the shower, you clean her up a little bit, you take her out afterwards.  Now, that's the dirt that can't be washed off.  You know?  That grime.  It's like, oh, you scrub it.  That ain't changing color. 
[00:47:30]  Kind of like that grime on the car.  Yeah.  How much you scrub it, it ain't coming off.  It don't matter.  It's like Bondo on your fender.  Yeah, there it is.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  Syndication now.  No, the new one's syndication underground.  Oh, yeah, syndication underground.  Bootleg tapes and whatever else it takes.  Adam, what's going on?  Syndication, I'm over here now.  Yeah, I just wanted to agree with you, too.  I'll be on the trashy girls.  Yeah?  I'm into that.  Yeah, definitely.  And it just amazes me that Anthony's not.  He does the whole dirty girl voice. 
[00:48:00]  I thought he was into that.  No, it's dirty girls, fine.  Trashy girls, fine.  The whole look is good.  I'm talking about the girls that look like they're dirty.  Like the other one, Drew Barrymore.  She looks like she would just be dirty.  Now, see, I see Drew, and my bell just goes off.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Like, I don't even have to think about it.  Yeah, a little sloppy, you know.  Yeah, she's happy.  Yeah, just like totally up for anything. 
[00:48:30]  No matter what you suggest, she's going to go for it.  Yes.  In the blue knot.  Here we go.  And then when you're finished, you don't even have to worry about it because she was,  you know, trash to begin with.  All right.  German fisting videos.  Yeah.  My God, we were watching some of those after the show yesterday.  We all went into the office and were viewing some of the German fisting videos that I got  from Steve C.  For your birthday.  From Steve C.  For my birthday.  Isn't that nice?  What a great gift.  What did you get for your, like, eighth birthday, Anthony?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, for my eighth birthday, I think I got, like, a Polaroid camera.  Yeah, maybe a microscope.  It was, yeah, a chemistry set, sure.  Something like that.  Yeah.  And maybe a Ross Apollo bicycle.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe one of those water rockets where you have to pump, pump, pump, pump, and it goes  Love those.  It goes off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did you get for your birthday yesterday?  Oh, German fisting videos.  Thank you, Steve C.  So, we were watching him last night. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, my God.  One guy, I swear to God, it was a German V2 in his pants.  He had, like, a ballistic missile.  And this girl wasn't even flinching.  Yeah.  Wasn't even flinching.  The best part about it was Psycho Mark doing interactive porno.  Oh, that was so funny.  This one girl's.  We got to get a tape of that and put it on the unofficial website.  One girl's butt right on the screen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You know what you're doing.  Go ahead.  And a guy's face, let's just say, he is fully involved. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Fully involved.  Yeah.  So, Mark puts his face right against the TV where the guy's face is.  And he's going, just going to town.  It looked so funny, man.  It was really funny.  He's sticking his tongue out.  He's just going crazy.  Those videos are so bad.  So evil.  Yeah.  I think that video could be worse than the 100-year-old lady getting banged that we had.  That we had about a half a year ago.  And there's just no rhyme or reason to him. 
[00:50:30]  Like, you get a porno, an American porno, and there's a plot lines to him.  This is just, oh, yeah.  I'm da dumper.  Yeah.  Oh.  Stricken ja das dumper.  He's just going to town, this Nazi freak, with a Louisville slugger in his pants.  Yeah.  Hogan. 
[00:51:00]  Hogan.  Look at the way Major Bullcloth is going at her.  Hogan.  Hogan.  It was disturbing.  Hogan.  Hogan, you are a fool.  Hogan.  Hogan.  Hogan.  Hogan.  Hogan.  Hogan.  Time for a fisting, Hogan.  I'll get you for this Hogan.  It was pretty disturbing.  It was really bad.  Like one scene, the guy with the Louisville slugger is, like, going to town.  Going to town, let's just say some backdoor action, as they call it. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  And there's another guy in this leather sofa, just doing himself.  Just like pleasuring himself.  And he's looking over at the scene, and you don't understand what they're saying.  It's just,  I don't even know what that means.  Das dumper?  Das dumper.  I can figure that one out.  Das, das, das poops. 
[00:52:00]  Das boot.  Das booty.  That's what it was.  Ah, in das booty.  Das poopy.  And then, of course, the fisting scenes.  That's just, wow.  We're talking elbows, pal.  Yeah, I know.  Elbows.  We all saw it.  They were looking for Hitler's lost skull.  The Russians found Hitler's skull. 
[00:52:30]  Is that true?  Yeah, I saw that in the paper.  There's like a piece of skull.  How the hell are they going to tell?  Well, they have his jaw, too, but they, you know, they have it locked away because it's  evidence or something like that.  They're looking for the part right under his nose so they can see if there's a little mustache  there.  That'll confirm it.  There's a big hole in this piece of skull, though.  The Russians have been saying they have Hitler's body for years, though.  It's like a big publicity stunt.  They're still all wacky on the war over there.  We, ah, yes, we have his skull. 
[00:53:00]  I don't.  He burnt it.  He was fisting Ava Braun while he bit into the cyanide tablet, getting it right in the  bunker.  Hitler's bunker.  Hitler, getting it with one of those wacky old World War II German hand grenades that  look like those lint removers that you scrape over your clothes. 
[00:53:30]  That's a dopey grenade.  Let me nail you with this.  All right, Dan.  Let's just take a break.  Bob from Westchester on the Instant Feedback.  You guys better replay Otto and George from yesterday or I'll be pissed.  Yeah, they were really fun today.  Hey, you know what's pathetic?  Came in today.  I'm talking to Rick about Otto and George, and it was really cool that he invited him  down for my birthday.  And I said I was so psyched to see George, the puppet.  Like Otto, you know, it's cool. 
[00:54:00]  Otto's cool.  But he's Otto.  He's like the straight guy and stuff.  I wanted to meet George.  Yeah, because George has all the personality.  The puppet.  The puppet has all the personality.  I'm looking at the puppet the whole time.  Yeah, because you talk to Otto, it's like, yeah, whatever.  I want to talk to the puppet.  George.  Where's George?  Dude, it got to the point.  I hope people understand.  I put a mic on for George, the puppet.  Yeah.  Because that's why you've got to go see him at Rascals Sunday at 8.  I think it's even sold out, so we're not even plugging anymore.  But it gets to the point, because it looks so damn real, that we were going to put headphones 
[00:54:30]  on the puppet.  Right?  It got that close.  Anyway, we're going to replay the Otto and George segment from yesterday in the 5 o'clock  hour.  And there is a ton of material you missed yesterday, because they were dumping out like crazy.  I think they dumped out 20 to 25 times.  Rick worked on it before the show, put all the bleeps in.  So trust me, there's a lot of stuff you missed.  So if you heard it yesterday, you're going to want to check it out again today for some  new stuff.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  And as we go to break, a lot of people are requesting old bits on the email. 
[00:55:00]  And yeah, I mean, sometimes like, nah, we don't want to play that again or that again.  But there's one that somebody requested we haven't played in a while.  One of my favorites.  One of your favorites, Rick, huh?  I love this one.  Yeah, I like this one a lot, too.  It's Dirty Columbo.  Dirty Columbo.  Is he German?  Dirty Columbo.  Ah, da dumper.  As we go to break, we'll be back.  Uh, hello, ma'am. 
[00:55:30]  This is Lieutenant Columbo.  Uh, I got a couple of questions to ask you.  Uh, could, could you shove your fist up my a**?  I'd love it if you could just stick your, your fist up my a**.  Listen, get your husband over here.  We'll pop my eye out.  And he could scull f**k me.  Could you do that, please?  Just scull f**k me?  I love that.  Uh, Mrs. Columbo, she pulls out a big a**, rips my eye out, and just shoves that thing 
[00:56:00]  right to my brain.  I love it.  All right, thank you.  Hey, oh, oh, what?  Pardon me.  One more thing, ma'am.  One more.  Bury your boot up my a**.  Could you do that?  And could you just grab my a** and twist it like a pretzel?  I'd love if you grab my a**, grab my shriveled old Columbo a**, and twist that thing like  a pretzel.  Okay, ma'am.  I gotta get back to the precinct now.  Oh, before I leave, one more thing. 
[00:56:30]  Could you do, ma'am, one more thing?  Put my a** in a vice.  Could you just clamp down on my a** and squeeze them till they come out of the hole in my head  that used to have an eye?  Oh, Columbo, don't you have to go arrest Martin Landau.  Oh, I was in a series once with Martin Landau, and after the show, after the shoot, as they  call it, I jammed my fist so far up his a**, I actually pulled out his prostate.  It was wonderful. 
[00:57:00]  We used to film at Universal Studios, and we'd all get together in the commissary and pound  each other.  and pound each other's a**, but there's no cake.  I can't say this.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.

[01:00:00]  Having fun today.  Very happy.  Yeah.  We're in a good mood for one.  Yeah, the dumper.  Yeah.  Oh, that's dumper.  That's pussy.  Dumper.  Yeah.  Ah, Megadeth.  Megadeth. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, we're in a good mood.  Post, uh...  New York Post wrote a nice article on the show.  Thank you.  I want to thank John Minnelli.  The picture's a little shaky because we're hungover and wearing the same clothes from the night before, but that's okay.  Yeah.  It happens.  It happens, but read it for yourself.  It's pretty good.  We should get Spaz in here because he was really happy that his name was in print for the first time.  Yeah, did you see that?  Those guys are out of their friggin' minds.  Yeah, Spaz, Stinky, Psycho Mark, all mentioned in the article today. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  That was in the New York Post.  I'm glad they're following our lead and not getting big heads, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm really happy that that's happening.  I was laughing at Spaz.  I walk in the office and, uh, you know, Spaz, like I said, Stinky and Psycho Mark mentioned in the article.  And, um, I say as a joke, I go, hey, Spaz, uh, Stinky's only been here, like, a month or so, a couple of months, and he's already in the newspaper. 
[01:01:30]  And, uh, this is your first appearance in the newspaper also.  And you know what he says?  As serious as a heart attack.  Well, let's ask him.  What'd you say, Spaz, to Anthony when he said that to you?  I said, well, my name was put first.  I got, I got top billing.  He was, he actually thought this out before I ever mentioned it, Tom.  Because I was thinking about it as I was reading it on the train.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  You were thinking about it, reading it on the train, going, at least I'm first.  You really thought that? 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  What an idiot.  I know.  Spaz, I could just see the headline now.  Spaz.  Spaz wins in New York radio.  Spaz, number one, K-Dawg, number one in mornings.  It's Spaz Radio from the top of the Spaz building.  You weren't happy for the team?  You just were happy that your name was mentioned before anyone else's?  Of course, Spaz or Psycho Mark.  Well, at least Psycho Mark, yeah.  I mean, I was, I was happy. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, no, I was happy for the team.  Yeah.  I was happy for the team.  It's just, I just didn't think my, my character name would be put in the paper.  Oh, it's your character name now, I see.  Hey, did they break all of the rules of journalism that you explained to us a few weeks back by  not putting your real name in there?  Well, I, you guys probably didn't divulge my real name.  Kevin Martin.  Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, come on.  No, no, no.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't say my last 
[01:03:00]  name.  You say, you don't say his last name, do you say mine?  Yeah, we don't.  That's all the time, you idiot.  That's so funny.  What, do you think the Spaz Maniacs are going to be outside your house now waiting, waiting  for you to come home?  Don't say my last name.  I never want my last name put on.  Neither did Wayne.  Neither did Wayne.  Now it's in the paper.  Shut up, Ben.  Anthony Cumia, Greg Hughes, and Kevin Martin.  It's, it's.  Don't bother that, John.  I don't know.  No, John, you're not dumping out of anything. 
[01:03:30]  John, dump out of that.  Do you think, do you think John is going to listen to you and dump out of that, knowing  damn well we would rush the dump button and kill him if he did that?  Well, he has more sense than that.  Come on.  Kevin Martin, don't ever do that.  Don't ever do that, John, come on.  You're going to have all your little fans waiting for you.  Yeah.  This is not the house.  It's a good thing I'm moving.  Yeah, good thing.  There you go.  What are you telling me to shut up for?  I just don't want people to know my last name.  Spaz, what do you picture that you're going to leave the building and it's going to be 
[01:04:00]  like the Beatles coming to New York for the first time and all the fans chasing you down  the street?  Kevin, Kevin, Kevin Martin.  Click, click.  Click, like all the photographers taking clip.  Faz, Faz, Faz, Faz, Faz.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[01:04:30]  Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!  John, dump out of all last name references.  Be quiet, sir.  He's not going to do that.  I'm your friend.  It's too late.  Come on.  Everyone's calling now.  They want to talk to Kevin.  But I don't want my last name on the air.  All right.  The listeners will be nice.  But then the people on hold know who my last name is.  It's too late.  It's out there.  Spaz.  Oh, man. 
[01:05:00]  And that's your new gig that Spaz is your character?  It's...  Okay.  We'll play along.  That's cute.  No, it's a character.  It's like Anthony says.  Mr. Anthony uses his character.  How's your brother Ricky?  He's not my brother.  All right.  Spaz, while we have you in here, are you working on Spaz's Week in Review for tomorrow?  Uh...  Yes, I am.  Very good.  I'm working on the effects of having your last name Ed.  Are you going to comment on Rudy G's prostate cancer?  We all found that out today, yes? 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to tie it into the Yankees.  Not only do the Yankees get cancer, now their fans get it, right, Spaz?  Will he be...  Is he joining the Yankees?  Is that why he has the cancer?  Well, he is a strong supporter.  He is a strong supporter, and he does meet with Seinbrenner a lot.  So you think that might have been why he got cancer?  Because he's a Yankee fan?  He wears a Yankee hat?  I've heard of weirder things.  Yeah, like you walk in the bridge.  Like you walk in the bridge.  I can't wait to hear that one.  That's good, Rick.  All right, we look forward to your report. 
[01:06:00]  We might as well just save it for tomorrow.  It's too late, dude.  Everyone's calling.  They want to talk to Kevin Martin.  Jump out of that, John, now.  You're a journalist, Kevin Martin, on the scene.  Jump out of that, John.  It's too late.  Why don't your last names go out in the air?  How come, like, you keep stopping yourself?  What, Anthony Cumia and Greg Hughes?  They've used that many times.  It's in the New York Post today.  What are we going to do?  Right.  What about Ben's name?  What about Rick's name?  Mark's name?  What about him?  They don't give out their last names.  They're not on the air.  Everyone know? 
[01:06:30]  Mark's on the air.  Give out his last name.  I don't even know Mark's last name.  It's Walsh.  I don't even know Stinky's real name.  I don't know Stinky's real name.  Jared.  What?  His name's Jared?  Garrett.  Garrett.  Garrett?  I don't know.  It's Stinky.  Honestly, who knew that Stinky's real name was Garrett?  Me.  I had no clue.  Who knew?  Kevin Martin.  Kevin.  Don't bother that, John.  Don't bother that, John.  Oh, wow.  Someone's already found your address. 
[01:07:00]  What?  Let me see that.  Oh, my God.  Is it right?  Just tell me if that's right.  No, it's not.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, Spaz.  Go answer the phone, please.  Thank God.  That was good.  Very good job.  Give a fun hello to Kevin Martin answering our phone.  My favorite Martin.  My favorite Martin.  All right, Anthony.  Anthony, Rick and Psycho Mark, are you guys doing this or what? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, we're going now.  Okay, this is cool.  The rest of the WOW stickers have arrived, Anthony.  The brand new WOW stickers.  We have 170,000 of them to get out.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Someone has a great idea.  Spaz, you dumbass.  If you only would have cursed after they said the name, you would have had to dump out.  Yeah.  He wasn't smart enough to figure that out.  Figure that one out.  So, I guess the boys, Rick and Psycho Mark, they're heading down to Penn Station.  They're going to be just floating around the streets out there.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Handing out WOW stickers as everyone, you know, catches their trains home and stuff, okay?  They're taking the new WOW van?  Are they taking the new WOW van?  Yes.  Yeah, the new Opie and Anthony WOW van.  So, if you're going to be in the, you know, the Penn Station area around, I don't know,  it'll take them about a half hour to get downtown, they'll have plenty of WOW stickers  to give out today, okay?  Uh-huh.  And they'll check in with us in a little while, but they're very cool.  The WOW sticker proudly displayed in the Post article today, Anthony.  Yes.  Anthony, very smart at marketing, lifted up the WOW sticker really fast when the Post photographer 
[01:08:30]  was taking his picture.  You know, what I did there is the equivalent of a guy throwing himself on a hand grenade  to save the platoon, and I'll explain why.  I held up the sticker.  Now, the whole time, we were just trying to make regular faces.  Right.  Because we always know the second you make a goofy face, that's the one they're going  to use in the paper.  Right.  Just talking, conversing normally, making normal faces.  I held up the sticker and did a little wacky smile, knowing that he would take that picture 
[01:09:00]  and use the picture with the WOW sticker because I was making the wacky face.  I sacrificed myself for the good of the show and WOW Opie.  And there it is.  Now that sticker's famous.  Look, you made the paper.  It's famous.  Just like it.  Yes.  Rick and Psycho Mark outside the Penn Station area with the WOW van handing out stickers  very shortly.  Okay?  They'll be leaving in about five minutes.  Take them a half hour.  Around 5.15 or so.  Okay?  All right.  Real fast, Ant, before we take another quick break.  Tom from Colmack. 
[01:09:30]  Thank you, Tom, for this.  If it's true, this is pretty cool for wrestling fans.  The word on the internet is that Stone Cold is coming back tonight on SmackDown.  What?  Stone Cold is coming back tonight on SmackDown.  Oh, is he?  That's the word on the internet.  You're damn right.  You got to think he would make an appearance because the pay-per-view is on Sunday.  Yeah, so he's going to step out there tonight.  Oh, the place will just go crazy if that's true.  And we have Shane McMahon coming on the show tomorrow, Anthony. 
[01:10:00]  That should be fun.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  Oh, cool.  All right.  So let's take a quick break, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Ah, yes, Opie.  Joey was down here, brought some fine food from Paisano for my birthday.  Thank you, Joey.  Yeah, I would like to have tasted Joey's food. 
[01:10:30]  Haven't been there in a couple weeks.  It's always good to have some of Joey's food before we do these live reads, right, Anthony?  Yes.  What happened?  And I love the food at Paisano.  Uh-huh.  Well, first of all, everyone ate all our food while we're doing your birthday show yesterday.  Opie, it's like asking people not to pick up gold doubloons strewn on the street.  They couldn't stay away.  Couldn't stay away from the food?  Of course.  And then Joey had, like, a special dish hidden for me.  And me too. 
[01:11:00]  He made me a big veal cutlet stuffed.  Did he get to eat yours?  No.  Okay, well...  It disappeared.  Well, mine was hidden.  And he goes, oh, I knew these animals that work for you would...  Filthy animals!  Would eat all the food.  So I put one aside.  I hid it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  He handed it to me.  Yes.  Thank you, Joey.  Linguini with red clam sauce.  Oh, yes.  Very...  Oh, my God.  You've got to have that.  Now, I was tired. 
[01:11:30]  So I'm like, I'm going to put this in our beer fridge and I'm going to eat it for lunch  today.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  How many times did I tell people to make sure my food stayed in the fridge?  So I hope you must be in a great mood because you got to eat some of Joey's fabulous food  from Paisano before the show.  Joey, your linguini ended up on the wall.  I apologize.  What happened?  I got to work and the linguini and red clam sauce,  the linguini and red clam sauce that I was really looking forward to all day. 
[01:12:00]  I'm not exaggerating.  I woke up and I'm like, yes, I am so psyched.  I'm sick of sushi.  I'm going to have some pasta.  It was on top of the beer fridge.  It was out all night.  I was so...  Ask these guys.  I was so freaking pissed.  Oh.  I threw beer bottles against the wall.  I threw the linguini and red clam sauce against the wall.  It was like a Picasso painting on the wall after I was done.  And they're all looking at me like I'm a wacko.  Because you guys don't listen.  I said, make sure my lunch is in there.  I don't ask for much. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  So you missed out.  I missed out.  So I'm pissed off today.  Paisano, linguini and red clam sauce.  Yeah.  Well, you don't have to miss out, people.  Go down to Paisano and Mulberry Street.  I didn't think I'd see the day.  Yeah, he's running out.  136 Mulberry.  They know how pissed I am.  At one point I picked up scissors.  I thought that might be a little out of hand.  Yeah, you can't be stabbing employees here.  Yeah, I'm a crybaby, whatever.  But it's great.  And also, when you get down there, I believe starting next week, look at the menu. 
[01:13:00]  You will see in the appetizer section, Anthony's fried ravioli.  I saw that, Anthony.  Yes, and down at the bottom of the menu, Opie's eggplant parmesan.  It's so at the bottom of the menu.  You know, if you blink, you're going to miss it.  Thanks, Joey.  I'm in the appetizer section.  Thanks, Joey.  Right up top.  For the placement in your menu.  Appreciate it.  I see the Italian guy gets right to the top of the menu.  Hey, huh?  Paisano, that's what it's called, Opie. 
[01:13:30]  The American mutt, all the way at the bottom.  You've got to be a paisano.  Anyway, yeah, we love paisano.  I would have loved to have it for lunch today.  So now I'm like, man, I want some pasta, so I went to one of these places around the corner.  Yeah.  Not as good.  Of course not.  And I'm pissed.  Well, incredible pasta lunch specials, too, down there at Paisano.  Yeah, I should have jumped on the subway.  Anyway, it's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You ask for Joey, you tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  He'll give you a glass of wine in the house, okay? 
[01:14:00]  Say, Joey, I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone to somebody's uterus?  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027.  I'm getting more info about Stone Cold on SmackDown tonight, Anthony.  Yes, I don't want to give anything away, but it looks like he is on SmackDown tonight. 
[01:14:30]  Let's just put it that way, okay?  Yeah.  And I think you're going to be very, very happy with the results.  Yeah, sounds pretty fun.  It looks like a pretty cool storyline, all right?  Cool.  Cool.  Trying to be cool so we won't give you any more.  Let's go to the phones.  Jules, I believe.  Jules.  Yeah, hey, guys.  What's up?  Yo, we're on the LIE exit 30 South.  All right.  I got a yellow Xterra.  I'm trying to get wowed. 
[01:15:00]  No luck, man.  Well, you got to get the new wow sticker.  There's hot-looking girls all over the place, and no one's wowing us.  Yeah, it's a bitch in a green car.  There's a green Cavalier convertible.  She's just not doing it for us, man.  Do you have any wow stickers on your car?  We went to the Met game.  We just got there, and we forgot the wow sticker or the wow sign.  We got a little piece of paper with a big wow on it, and we're not getting anything.  Well, you got to put a little more effort into it than that. 
[01:15:30]  Yo, we're trying to.  We're hanging out the window trying to get wowed.  All right.  What exit you at right now?  Right now, we're approaching 30 South, heading east on the LIE.  A yellow Xterra.  You can't miss it.  All right.  If there's any ladies in the area that are listening to the show, throw these guys a bone,  okay?  You guys are awesome, man.  All right, Jules.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Hey, wait.  Did the Mets win today?  We left.  It was the 10th in English, 1-1.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:16:00]  Speaking of wow, Anthony, if you want a brand new wow sticker, we got to say it again.  A lot of people, you know, they're not going to be able to get these stickers personally  because they live far away and stuff.  That's okay.  All you have to do is send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Opie and Anthony Show  wow sticker, something like that.  WNEW.  Put all that on the envelope, okay?  Yeah.  888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 1-0-1-0-6.  I believe that address is on the NEW website and our unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Mets lost 2-1 in Cincinnati.  Thank you, Ben, for that. 
[01:16:30]  And also speaking of wow stickers, you want to pick them up today.  Rick?  Yeah.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  All right.  Are they stolen already?  What do you got, a contact buzz from Psycho Mark?  Yeah, Psycho Mark and Rick in the wow van, the official Opie and Anthony wow van.  Yeah.  We're like Batman at this point.  We got a wow vehicle.  We need a wow cop.  Hey, dude, shut up for a second.  What?  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  We just went through Times Square. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Hold on for a second.  And Fat Dave from MTV was out front with a cameraman.  Yeah.  And Mark leans out the front with a freaking bullhorn and screams, hey, it's Fat Dave from MTV.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Everybody lost their ass.  Even the cameraman was laughing.  And now Mark is abusing people as we crawl towards Penn Station.  All right.  You're from out of town. 
[01:17:30]  You're from out of town.  You're from out of town.  You're laughing and holding on to me.  A lunatic.  No, we're heading down to Penn right now.  We should be there in a couple minutes.  They're going to be circling the area of Penn Station with the wow stickers.  Just look for the wow van and psycho Mark with the bullhorn.  I've got to jump out of him.  All right, guys.  Let's call back in a bit.  How long is it going to take to get to Penn? 
[01:18:00]  Like another five minutes.  All right.  And you'll be outside Penn Station.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bye.  Wow.  They've gone 20 blocks without killing each other yet.  I'm amazed.  Yeah, those two really don't like each other.  They really hate each other.  I'm amazed they're doing this together today.  Are we right or what?  All right, Anthony.  Oh, but Mets lose 2-1 in the 11th.  Yeah, I announced that.  Just thought I'd bring that up to you.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  We're still doing very well this year.  Oh, I know.  Anthony.  I understand.  Okay.  You don't have as much cancer as the Yankees, though,  so we've got that going for us.  Yeah, what do you think of the mayor?  Announcing to everyone that he has, you know, prostate cancer.  They caught it early, though, and it's looking pretty good.  He'll be okay.  Well, let's listen to Buddy Epson for a little advice.  Use it or lose it.  That's it.  Use it or lose it. 
[01:19:00]  Have you heard Buddy Epson going in for prostate cancer?  No.  No.  You know why?  Use it or lose it.  That's right.  See?  I don't think Rudy's getting enough.  You've got to...  Your prostate...  Oh, my God.  That thing is like a pool filter.  Sometimes it's got to be backwashed every so often, or it gets clogged.  You've got to throw it out.  You've got to keep fluids moving through that thing.  He's got to get laid.  He's got to get laid. 
[01:19:30]  Let's get him a banging.  When you've got your prostate working overtime, pumping stuff out, keeps it clean.  That's right.  No time for anything to jack up in there.  You should spend more time in the peep shows instead of shutting them down.  That's my opinion on the whole thing, Opie.  That's brilliant.  I think so.  Obviously showing why we're number one in afternoon drive in New York City.  Of course.  It's like anything else in your body. 
[01:20:00]  What happens if, let's say, you don't use your arm muscles?  You get really weak.  Yeah, it will atrophy.  It will not be a good word.  If you don't use something, it gets bad.  So if you don't use your prostate, which is the thing that produces your seminal fluid,  it's going to back up on you.  Gunk up.  Use it or lose it, buddy.  Use it or lose it.  See?  How happy you think Hillary was today to hear that.  I hear she actually called up. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, I'm pretty amazed.  She's showing she has a heart.  That's interesting.  That's a PR.  Well, we know that, but that's a PR move just like somebody from another station  sending newspaper clippings over to somebody else at another station.  Did that happen today?  I think so.  It has nothing to do with you caring about the other individual.  It's just a little turn of a screw.  So it works both ways.  So what radio station would do that?  Let's see who's in the paper today. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, look at that.  There's a little underground battle going on.  It's hysterical.  We get clippings.  They get clippings.  Well, let's...  I just want to announce that I didn't actually sign the picture.  Someone forged my signature.  Forged your signature.  Yes, yes.  I don't want to get in trouble with anyone.  That's pretty funny.  Good article in the post on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  Thank you, John Minnelli.  But, yeah, Hillary called up and said,  blah, blah, blah. 
[01:21:30]  I feel for you.  Oh, my God.  The big C.  Did you ever think...  Rudy Giuliani battling the big C.  I don't mean the cancer.  I mean Hillary.  She's a big C.  We all know what that is.  I am now entering the most difficult battle of my life. 
[01:22:00]  The battle against my prostate.  If only Donna said over my life would...  Instead of going up, please call the vagina monologue.  Give me a little vagina monologue.  I have an open conversation with my prostate, for the love of God.  I think I should be doing it for 20 years.  My prostate, the doctor said, looks like my head. 
[01:22:30]  All super inflated.  Like a beluga whale.  Yeah, Hillary called up to tell me she's sorry  and give me some point about my prostate cancer.  And I said I would do the same if she got prostate cancer.  That's a joke.  She doesn't have a prostate.  She's a lady.  Got to be a little up on your anatomy to get that little joke. 
[01:23:00]  But I will prevail.  I will prevail.  I will cut it out with my lightsaber.  What's he going to do?  Did they say what kind of treatment he's going to get?  Well, the radioactive seed implant.  Well, I was listening to 1010 Winds, Anthony, for the press conference.  And it turns out that he didn't even want to announce that he had this prostate cancer  because it's too early.  Because he wanted to talk to his doctors and see what course he was going to take 
[01:23:30]  to try to treat this thing.  Yeah.  But because a post photographer saw him going in to the hospital, he figured, oh boy, I've got to say something.  And that's what he did.  And we'll find out in the coming weeks.  If you don't want anyone to know, why don't you like admit someone in your family that day  and then just say you're going to visit them.  Yeah, do something.  Yeah.  Yeah, be a little smarter about it, right?  But no.  He'll be all right.  My dad's been through that a bunch.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Sucks.  The whole prostate thing?  Yeah.  Was he getting a lot of use out of his prostate, if I may ask, hoping?  Use it or lose it.  I guess not.  Maybe we should get my dad a-banging.  Is that a hint?  Oh, my God.  You've got to use that thing, people.  It's like anything else.  You know the old pumps?  You know the old pumps like Little House on the Prairie where they go outside and pump the water?  Right?  Sure.  Now, if you see one of those pumps now, after not being used for years, what is it like? 
[01:24:30]  The water's not that good.  It's rusty.  You can't even move it.  Right.  It's clogged.  You must keep these things well lubricated.  Be friends with your prostate.  You've got an interesting way of looking at it, Anthony.  Bob from Staten Island writes, God hates people who close down sex clubs.  Isn't that ironic?  He closes down the sex clubs, which are like a stimulus for men's prostates.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  Why?  It is.  Oh, okay. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I'm just trying to be really sarcastic today.  Oh, okay.  Well, your prostate is used, Opie, in the making of the fluid.  Or as Dice would say, the banana juice.  The banana juice.  Okay, sure.  So he shut down the clubs that a lot of these guys go to that keeps their prostate working.  And now he has a problem with his prostate.  I find that ironic.  Don't you think? 
[01:25:30]  Are you talking to, like, first graders today?  A lot of guys have no clue what their prostate's for.  Where is the prostate, Anthony?  Uh, well, I wish you would do.  All right.  Alex, what's up?  Yo, and hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, you know what?  Did you see the wasabi one yet?  I don't know.  Oh, the wasabi commercial with the what's up guys.  Hilarious.  Oh, they're at the sushi place? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Wasabi.  Wasabi.  And the cutaways to all the guys working at the sushi place.  It's priceless.  Anyway, go ahead, Alex.  All right.  I bet Spaz thinks that Giuliani's cancer is just publicity to get elected.  You think it's a publicity stunt?  No, Spaz thinks that.  Oh, Spaz thinks that.  Well, we'll find out tomorrow when Spaz does his weekend review.  Yeah, and you guys got to watch SmackDown, right?  It's going to be good.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  Okay, later.  All right, man.  Bye.  Yeah, Stone Cold's coming back tonight on SmackDown, it looks like. 
[01:26:30]  He's milking his cancer for sympathy for the Senate run.  Well, a lot of people saying that Rudy is using his prostate.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  We say that, we'll get sued.  Yeah, I know.  That one we can't say either, I know.  Oh, let me read him.  Oh, yeah, well, I don't think that's true, though.  That's what they're saying, though.  I don't think he's having any kind of an affair with the secretary or anything. 
[01:27:00]  That's been alleged in news things, but I don't believe it.  Honestly, I don't.  I think the guy, personally, has taken a vow of celibacy for some apparent reason.  I don't know.  No, he's kidding.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I can't imagine he's going home and, you know, waxing the carrot.  I'm the mayor of New York.  Imagine that.  That's a power trip.  A little power play you could play on the chicks.  But he never goes out.  He can't go out. 
[01:27:30]  He can't even walk into a hospital.  He got his prostate checked.  Got his banana glands checked.  Big suburban cruising the bar scene.  Yeah.  I'm going to stop.  All right.  Let's go to privilege, guys.  Come on.  Load up the suburban.  Get the cops.  We need an escort.  I got to get my prostate working again.  Got to lube this thing up.  Use it or lose it.  Yeah, buddy.  That's what we've learned today. 
[01:28:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  We're going to replay the Otto and George thing in a few minutes.  He's here very excited.  Thank God.  I got to take a dump.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Should I have let that out?  Come on.  I'm kidding.  Yeah, we've been trying to get Otto and George on the show for a long time.  It finally happened yesterday.  And they dumped out of the segment so much, like 20 to 25 times.  And every time you dump out, you're losing four seconds of content. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Makes it a little choppy and stuff.  You can barely tell why they were dumping out.  Yeah, so Rick, you know, worked on it, put all the bleeps in.  Wow.  It's really, really good.  Yeah, he's a pisser, man.  I'm looking forward to hearing it again.  We're going to do that in a few minutes here, okay?  All right.  Also, if you're heading down to Penn Station to get out of town, your day's over, or you're  just in the area, we got Rick and Psycho Mark together.  That's an amazing feat upon itself, but they're there together, and they're handing out the  brand new Wow stickers to the commuters, Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  To the commuters around Penn Station.  Just look for the big Wow van, okay?  Great.  All right.  Tom from College Point checking in.  Oh, so Anthony has the fried ravioli at Paisano on the menu, and Opie has the eggplant  parmesan.  What about the Kevin Martin fruitcake dessert?  Out of that.  What are you doing, man?  He's all flustered.  He's all flustered.  Put that back in there.  Put the one I had back in there, and go answer the phones.  Holy smokes. 
[01:29:30]  You're losing your mind.  He is so frazzled.  You don't know what I've been through.  Don't worry about it.  God, it's like he's a former president or something.  I want to be left alone.  I want to be alone.  He really thinks he's, like, famous.  What if people know where I live and come over the day I have Ken Stevens, our boss over  for cocktails?  It would be embarrassing.  He's really pissed off because we gave his last name out on the radio. 
[01:30:00]  I know.  All right, Anthony, let's take a break.  We'll get into the Otto and George thing next.  Stay there.  This is your announcer, Hugh Mungusbecker, saying,  Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie, Boopie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  We're obnoxious little assholes.  1027 WNEW.  Obviously another reason why we're number one.  Yeah.  Maybe there was a mistake. 
[01:30:30]  212-757-1027.  Let's talk to Dave real fast.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, Rick and Mark are two sick-ass fans out.  She's at the light next time I'm on 38th and 7th, tormenting every single girl walking  by, man.  You guys rule.  Oh, cool.  You saw the big wow van?  Yeah, man.  I got some stickers posted on my car.  Hopefully I get wowed.  All right.  Let us know how it works for you, okay?  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Hey, thanks, Dave.  Yeah, we got Rick and Psycho Mark heading down to Penn Station.  That's the area they're attacking today with the brand new wow stickers, Anthony. 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  The wow sticker featured in our post article today.  Oh, of course.  Thanks to Anthony holding it up real fast.  Prominently displayed with an explanation of Whip Mount Wednesday in the paper also.  I guess you figured, you know, everyone else is, you know, putting the wow on live TV  and stuff, and you would do your part, right, Ant?  Yes, I did.  You're officially a Psycho Mark psychopath, I believe.  Wow.  There's a proud moment in my career right there.  Right there.  That's it.  Where else can I go?  Shut that guy. 
[01:31:30]  We got wild stickers out.  We got Anthony.  Wow.  He's out of his mind.  Here he comes.  Look at this fat guy cover.  Let me explain something to our listeners.  People think Psycho Mark puts this on as an act.  No, this is how he is all day long.  Yeah, he just acts like this.  We're wild stickers.  Let me know it.  I'm amazed the guy doesn't get punched in the face every day.  All right, where are you guys?  Hey, yeah, we're in front of, what do you call it, the 34th Street entrance to Penn Station. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, right in front of the K-Mart.  Hey, wait a minute.  Come on, man.  I can't go home.  Oh, my God.  We've already had, like, four cop cars pull us over and get their new stickers.  Oh, very nice.  We support the men in blue.  Yeah, they're working hard.  All right, so you guys are just about.  You guys are going to get to bring a new wow sticker up for your beautiful car.  I'm like, oh, he's selling them. 
[01:32:30]  He's selling them, yeah.  Come and get them.  Come and get them.  Right, so it's up first.  All right, you guys are going to be out there for, what, another half hour, 45 minutes or so?  Yeah, another half hour or so if we don't get arrested for it.  All right, just look for the wow van outside Penn Station today with the new wow stickers, okay?  Woo!  All right, thank you, Rick.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  And this just handed to me, Anthony, and when you get one of these wow stickers, check out the offer from R.C. Edge Soda on the back of the sticker.  You could win a weekend for two in Philadelphia to see the WWF's Unforgiven Pay-Per-View Spectacular live. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  From R.C. Edge Maximum Power Trip and 1027 WNAW.  Okay?  All right.  All right, Anthony.  You want to play the Otto and George thing?  Yes, sure.  I've got to hear this without all the dumps that happened last night.  Well, it's safe to say that Otto and George, it's actually Otto, and his little friend is George.  George just happens to be a puppet, right, Anthony?  Yeah, who's really a little rude.  He's very obnoxious.  He's over the top. 
[01:33:30]  He's got a problem.  He's very X-rated.  Otto, very nice guy.  Down to earth.  Yeah.  A bit on the shy side.  His puppet, an obnoxious F.  I don't know how that happens.  I can't imagine Otto saying some of the stuff George says.  Yeah.  Even though you realize, I mean, he is saying.  I know it's a puppet act, but in some weird way, it worked on the radio yesterday.  And we want to now play it without all the dump outs, okay?  Yeah.  All right, you want to set the scene, Anthony?  Because people have to understand that Otto sits there, his puppet is so realistic, 
[01:34:00]  that you start believing the damn thing's alive.  Well, it's also because Otto will sit there and be looking, let's say, at you, if you're  talking, while he's listening to you, the puppet's looking around the room.  Looking around the room, starts looking at the side of Otto's head, and then makes some  outrageous comment in the middle.  Some comment.  He's looking at Steve C.  Yeah.  He's looking at me as Otto is just talking to you.  Yeah.  Or talking on the mic.  The puppet is looking around the room, which was frightening. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It was like a scene out of that movie Magic.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  With Anthony Hopkins.  Oh.  Very scary.  That's a great movie.  So, yeah, it was my birthday, and Rick surprised me by bringing in Otto and George, who we saw  at Caroline's and just killed.  He does kill.  And I just got to say, it was so realistic that I was ready to offer the puppet some  headphones.  That's no joke.  Little puppet-sized headphones.  Yeah, because, I mean, his eyes are moving, his mouth's moving.  Eyebrows.  Eyebrows.  And then, you know, you don't even look at Otto anymore. 
[01:35:00]  You just start talking to the puppet.  It's beyond bizarre.  All right?  So, I hope you got that picture in your head as you listen to this next segment, okay?  Yes.  Otto and George from yesterday.  All right, Rick.  It's Anthony's birthday.  Anthony's birthday.  Surprise number what?  Three?  How many surprises have we had so far?  We've had Joey and the Chimay and the food.  Yeah.  All right.  What was the other surprise?  Oh, the German fisting video.  German fisting video.  Thank you.  Steve.  And now for Anthony's nerd surprise. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, this is a good one.  This is a good one.  This is a really good one.  I'm scared.  I hate these.  This is good, dude.  You're going to like this one.  Yeah!  All right!  Oh, yeah!  What's up?  I got to see it.  It's Otto and George.  It's Otto and George.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Thanks, man.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Goddamn.  Wait, you better put headphones on George there.  Get into the headphones.  Tell the day to write parking.  How many guys you got in this room? 
[01:36:00]  It's a sausage party in here.  I'm here with Gorilla Boy.  Yeah, two six-packs of nice to brow and some cold tea for you got in day on.  I didn't know what to get you for your birthday.  I got you a bag of Coke and some sugar up.  Hey, thanks, man.  Thanks a load for me.  Oh, man.  Hey, that was great.  All right.  This sucks. 
[01:36:30]  We got to tell everyone.  I mean, Otto and George, one of our faves.  Yes.  We just saw him at Caroline's a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  And this is a huge surprise.  We've been trying to get him on the show for a long time now, Anthony.  Love you guys.  This is great.  Holy smoke.  It's good to be here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you.  I'm so afraid to even talk.  Otto and George, well, he's got a puppy with him that is very real. 
[01:37:00]  Morris was late.  I had to eat in that Brooklyn diner downstairs.  I had the broken leg of lamb.  That was a joke.  Come to Rascals.  Come to Rascals.  Come to Rascals.  We should give John the dump guy a run for his money today and just let Otto and George  just go until they run out of delay and hit the Van Halen song again today.  It's your responsibility.  We'll watch our button go black when we realize he's used up all our dumps. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Otto and George are going to be at Rascals when?  Sunday night, eight o'clock with Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy, and Chips Cooney, great magician.  Goddamn.  Chips is probably listening right now.  He's working on a Chris Rock movie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, he's an actor as well.  Okay.  You've got to go down and check these guys out.  Yeah, come on down.  It should be good.  Let me do the talking, all right?  You boring ass.  I'm a good friendship, too. 
[01:38:00]  The dummy talking back to Otto.  Why do I even have to come here?  Can't you just do the voice and let me stay home?  Who validates here?  All right.  $35 to come to this place.  Norris, you working out?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Say something.  You're on the air.  I've got to protect Otto on stage.  Yeah, we need protections.  Yeah.  Drive to my gigs in an ambulance or from the gigs in an ambulance. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, we saw you down at our car lines.  Yeah.  Man, I was dying.  That's very funny.  That's the first time you saw Otto and George, Anthony.  Yeah.  You've got to go to Rascals.  Check him out, man.  Very funny.  I've been following Otto and George for many years.  I hope you don't mind that I follow you, Otto.  That's okay.  Yeah?  That's all right.  What do you think of Jay Moore ripping off all your lines?  Jay's been good to me. 
[01:39:00]  He put me on his TV show.  I mean, you know, nobody's ever done anything like that for me.  You know, I've known a lot of famous guys.  Mm-hmm.  No, we like Jay.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  He gives you a lot of credit.  A lot of credit.  I don't know.  He's a little...  Jay's a little off, though.  Yeah.  I think he likes his NyQuil.  Does he, Jeff?  We all have a cross to bear.  He's that big guy with the camera there.  What the hell is he doing?  Oh, that's Steve, George.  Recording this for prosperity.  Yeah.  Put the camera down. 
[01:39:30]  Do some sit-ups.  Look at you.  Look at yourself.  All right.  There's jelly on that camera.  All right.  Do a sit-up.  All right.  You're wasting away to a warehouse.  Come on, George.  Don't insult these guys.  This is a very important show.  Yes.  These guys are big in New York.  Don't you realize if they plug one of our dates that we could sell out, we could wind up  getting the door.  We get the door.  Who do I do first?  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:40:00]  We get the door.  We get the door?  All right.  Which one's after me?  All right.  Easy, George.  Easy.  I'm giving out Hummers.  Anthony's the Italian-looking one to your left there.  How you doing?  I can't believe I'm talking to a puppy, but...  You think he looks Italian?  Looks like a greasy Puerto Rican to me.  Rick would be the greasy Puerto Rican right over there.  Really?  Our producer, Rick.  Yeah, it is Rick.  Oh, the guy, that guy, a little misshaping skull going there.  All right. 
[01:40:30]  Looks like a coffee mug.  All right.  Easy.  Oh, my God.  This really sucks.  Nobody better fart in here.  All right.  There's a goddamn submarine in here.  Sausage party.  I know.  There's lots of guys who are getting paid.  I'm paying $30 and talking.  There's a lot of guys in here.  I apologize.  We have some strippers coming by in a little while, I think.  That's...  Really?  Yeah.  I'm staying. 
[01:41:00]  So these guys are really big in New York, George.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  My friend Angelo Vazio is here with me.  My photographer.  Hi.  He's Greek.  Hello, my friend.  Broccoli, culli, flower, string bean.  Teas, cabbage, spinach, pie.  Baked potato.  It's too early.  He's Greek.  All right.  His balls smell like feta cheese. 
[01:41:30]  It stinks in this room.  Yeah.  Sorry for all the guys in here.  Happy birthday.  No, happy birthday.  Jeff brought pizza.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jeff.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's from Jersey.  You know how the pizza is out there?  It's like Wonder Bread with V8 port on it.  Get the pizza in Midtown, you schmuck.  All right.  You carried it.  It's pizza in Jersey.  You carried it, George.  Went to Canada.  He's arguing with the clothes.  You carried it.  You're arguing with a puppet, you little kid. 
[01:42:00]  On a bench with eyebrows.  You're all right.  It's going to be some show Sunday.  It's going to be great.  Sunday at Rascals, 8 o'clock.  It's going to be a good show if you show up.  I'm going to show up.  Well, he doesn't show up at some of the gigs there, George.  Yeah, he's a real loser.  I think my mom is listening, too. 
[01:42:30]  Hi, Mom.  Hey, good.  You usually listen to Bob Grant, but I told her to tune in.  Bob Grant.  Yeah.  You're for the food.  How old is that guy?  When is he going to die around?  All right.  Bob Grant.  Get in the coffin.  George, you should invite Anthony as a special guest for Sunday for his birthday as well.  Oh, really?  You should have him front row.  Special guest.  You're invited.  Sunday.  Come down.  Okay.  Are you giving me lessons on how to kiss ass? 
[01:43:00]  I know what I'm doing.  Get the bumper stickers and get in the car.  Get the car.  What do you want bumper stickers?  They should buy us pizza.  All right.  I'm lying in their pockets.  It's an evil conglomerate in here.  All right.  You radio bastards.  You're full of nature.  Wow.  He's a little angry today, I see.  You seem angry, George.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  Doesn't seem happy to be here, Anthony.  I don't know how a puppet gets so pissed off.  Rough right in.  It gets a friend here at its finest, folks.  I can't tell.  Eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock at Rascal's Sunday night.  Thanks.  You're going to have a full house.  Oh, man.  Seats are going to go quick.  Call now.  We're going to make sure everyone goes down there.  I don't want to enjoy nothing like them, man.  No.  You know that film you guys got on your website called The Meal, where the two kids are eating  the two?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A friend of mine made that, Craig Cifola. 
[01:44:00]  He's, I made a film with him called Telegrappies.  I just wanted to plug it.  It's called Telegrappies.  It's a short film.  Telegrappies.  And if you want to see it, it's on ifilm.com.  Okay.  That's another plug.  I saw that one, The Meal.  Yeah.  And it's two guys in a backyard eating what appears to be fecal matter.  Yep.  A pataki.  A pataki.  Yeah.  Or a hot lunch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Craig makes these films.  It's great. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Cleveland Steamer.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  They look like young guys.  Well, they were, the actors.  Oh, they were actors.  Yeah.  They were just kids.  Yeah.  I thought maybe they did the movie themselves.  No, I don't know.  Someone was responsible behind it?  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a casting call.  A casting call.  You don't look real enough eating that load.  Yeah.  That dump.  Yeah, let's try it again.  Yeah.  A hot lunch.  Yeah.  All right.  Cleveland Steamer.  All right.  He's mellowing out over there.  That's good. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm running out of steam.  You're running out of steam.  You've only been here five minutes.  They don't even offer a beverage.  You're here.  Just to suck.  All right.  It's okay, George.  Four dollars for the bridge.  Parking.  All right.  This guy with the pizza.  They like pizza.  I've never seen a...  Stop buying shit.  You're in.  You're in.  All right.  I was just going to say...  What do you mean that gift?  I've never seen him so radio-friendly right up until that point.  Yeah.  You have to go to Rascals Sunday, 8 o'clock, Otto and George? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  To hear the Pope joke.  Oh, yeah.  The most amazing joke I've ever heard in my life.  I can't do the Pope joke here.  We understand you can't do the Pope joke here.  Got to go to Rascals.  That'll be something to look forward to when you go to Rascals Sunday at 8 with Otto and George.  That's Spaz, by the way.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks, Spaz.  That's Spaz, yeah.  Thanks for the water.  A Snapple would have been nice.  Can't that Indian guy get me a Slurpee at least? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, please.  I don't know.  He's been working here for like 30 years and you're insulting him?  Who cares?  All right, go.  George.  30 years, George.  A little respect.  Yes.  Sorry, sir.  May shirt leave on assembly?  Dressed up, happy to be living here.  How are you supposed to have everyone like you if you can insult everyone? 
[01:46:30]  George, don't you want to be light?  Come on.  These are nice guys here.  Be nice.  Be nice to the customers.  I'm scared.  I don't want to make eye contact.  I don't want to look at the puppet.  He had a rough ride in.  He had to argue with the toll lady at the Lincoln.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he got a little pissed off at the toll lady.  Yeah, I like to heat up my change, shove the quarters in my butt for a few minutes, and then hand it to him.  Here you go, exact change. 
[01:47:00]  You're going to do that, heat up a quarter, and hand it to the guy, laughing at him.  That must be something.  You pull up to a toll booth and you're getting yelled at.  He was driving.  George drove in.  George drove my truck.  Yeah.  I got pulled over once, and I pulled the puppet out of the back seat, and I was going, grab his gun, grab his gun.  My friend's going, please, shut up, don't do that.  Grab his gun.  Let him go.  Let him go. 
[01:47:30]  It's only five beers.  Grab his gun.  Is the Indian guy laughing?  You can't tell with that guy.  All right.  He's laughing a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Rascals Sunday.  Goddamn, I wouldn't miss it.  Come on.  You're crazy.  Which Rascals?  West Orange.  West Orange.  What's the phone number?  Because we want to sell out this place Sunday.  Unprepared. 
[01:48:00]  No, I don't.  Look it up.  We'll look it up.  No big deal.  West Orange Rascals.  Otto and George.  Sunday at 8 o'clock.  One of our faves, I'm telling you.  Anthony saw him for the first time, what was that, two weeks ago?  My size hurt.  I was dying, man.  You had a table up front of women from the Midwest.  Oh, yeah.  And George was relentless.  I was screaming.  Yeah, they looked so Midwestern and rosy and just so innocent.  So happy to be there.  They're probably just walking down Times Square and go, oh, look, a comedy club.  We'll catch one of those fun, clean little acts. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're just getting lambasted by George.  Yeah.  Friggin' hysterical, man.  Yeah.  And let's not forget the 14-year-old girl in the front row.  Oh, my God.  The father has, you know, he's got problems.  Yeah, the father brings a 14-year-old girl to Seattle and George.  Let me tell you something.  She was one hot 14-year-old.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Half the time I'm looking at what's on stage, half the time I'm looking at her ass.  Yeah.  George, did you like that hot little 14-year-old?  Yeah, not too bad.  I like a girl who's got Snoopy on her underwear. 
[01:49:00]  That horny, horny, horny, horny.  Yeah, what father does that, though?  It was kind of a weird-looking situation.  They had a table all by themselves.  Yeah, that was a little bit weird, you know.  It's like, what are you going to do, rent Caligula and show that to her next?  How open-minded do you want to be?  Hey, honey, look at the fisting scene.  Yeah.  This is great.  Who was it, Joey Butterfuoco?  Yeah.  I thought it was abusive.  It's not my fault, you know.  Yeah, you're doing your act, man.  And he's bringing his young daughter in there. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I did this bachelor party once, and the guy, like, ten minutes before the gig goes,  oh, listen, there's a Monsignor here tonight.  Can you work clean?  He's, like, sitting ringside.  He goes, why did you hire me?  No, I can't work clean.  Tell him to take a walk.  Give him, you know, tell him to leave for an hour so everybody else can see what they came to see.  It's absurd.  Damn clergy ruining our good time.  Yeah.  Taking all the joy out of this world.  George, you awake over there?  Yeah, not too bad, man. 
[01:50:00]  Okay, yeah.  What did the black lesbian say to the white lesbian?  You the man!  Right, George.  George, Jesus.  Look alive, Morris.  All right.  Happy birthday.  Here's some nice-to-brow and cold pizza.  I like being here.  Maybe he's just on a budget.  Yeah.  Maybe George hasn't got laid in a while and that's why he's so angry.  Yeah, I'm pretty horny.  Shivers, Regal, and White Castle next year.  I'm telling you, I know what I'm talking about. 
[01:50:30]  I love that.  White Castle, Shivers, Regal.  Gorilla boy!  I could use some...  I could say pussy.  Why didn't you tell me that?  Pussy!  Pussy!  A big...  Pussy!  That's romantic to say, right?  Pussy!  Pussy!  No, that's...  Well, I don't know if you can say it that way, but... 
[01:51:00]  Why not?  It's not in any context, is it, Opie?  No, you can say whore, too.  You can say whore?  Yeah, you have a very special way of saying whore, George.  George?  Oh, sorry.  I'm staring at the console, wondering what I can get for that.  It's the back of the computer I'm looking at.  And Gorilla Boy.  Look at my forearms.  Look how tough I am, like Arnold.  All right.  I am tough and strong like Arnold. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  You should have seen him climbing up the side of the building with the pizza and the beer.  All right.  Plane shooting at him.  All right.  You big bully.  All right.  All right.  I protected Jay Moore.  You heard about that.  That's awesome.  Yeah, you took a punch for him.  For Jay Moore.  Really?  My buddy.  That's cool.  Like the Secret Service of radio.  All right.  We do have the number, Anthony.  Very good.  Cool.  Otto and George, I'm telling you, you've got to go.  Sunday, 8 o'clock show. 
[01:52:00]  One show only?  Yeah, just one.  Yeah.  It's early, so, you know, it's a work night, so people can see the show and still be in  bed by 11.  You don't know what we could do for you, Otto.  Yeah.  We could get you, like, 10 shows like we did Jay Moore.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You want to just start with one?  We can start with one.  Okay.  Maybe next time you'll go for the 10?  Yeah.  I mean, that's all I got.  Sunday night.  Yeah, it's a great show.  And you're going to see Chips Cooney, who was on the Drew Carey show when he did that Mr.  the Las Vegas special, and Jeff Norris, who I work with all the time. 
[01:52:30]  No, screw that.  You're going to go to see George.  Yeah, screw Jeff.  Yeah.  George is the show this time around.  Sunday, 8 o'clock at Rascals West Orange.  The number is 973-736-2726.  It's going to sell out fast, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  And we encourage everyone to go see Otto and Jeff.  Pussy!  Pussy!  Bitch!  Bitch!  Pussy!  What is wrong with you?  Here's Tourette's.  Pussy! 
[01:53:00]  Poor!  Poor!  Quit that!  Poor!  He's out of control.  You got Tourette's.  George got Tourette's.  He's absolutely losing it.  Don't you want to be on network TV eventually, George?  What's that guy staring at me?  He's happy to see you.  Ugh.  All right.  I hate people who are happy to see me.  All right.  Because if I walked in here without you, they'd go, oh, you didn't bring George? 
[01:53:30]  They're all sick in here.  They all think I'm real.  Mental illness.  Treat it before it kills you.  Oh, did I mention pussy?  Pussy!  Pussy!  Talk-a-doodle-doo.  This is so easy.  They're like children.  Yeah, that's true.  We got a congressman on the line.  Really?  Yeah, you want to make fun of a congressman, George?  I'll be respectful.  Let me take this call, George. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Put the homosexual priest on.  Oh, my God.  Gary Ackerman.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  We're hanging with Otto and George in the studio today.  I've been listening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No wonder why your ratings have gone through the roof.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you, Gary.  Oh, Father.  Have a good morning to you.  You've been in the auto boys lately, have you?  No, he's a congressman.  Oh, he's a congressman?  Yeah.  Oh.  Not a clergyman.  He thought I was a congregation. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  What district are you?  The 5th Congressional District of New York.  And what have you done for the poor black man in the street lately?  I didn't mug him.  I got an alibi.  This guy's a racist and a black man.  Easy, George.  Easy.  I got to compete with a puppet?  Yeah, we all do right now.  There's Republicans out there.  I got to get a puppet.  Get some sugar's regal for the congressman.  Yeah.  All right, George.  I'd rather have the White Castle. 
[01:55:00]  That would be good.  All right.  Whores and White Castle.  Atusa.  Hey, Gary, do you have any opinions on the Elion Gonzalez thing?  Yeah, I'm out of opinion.  Good.  We don't want to hear it.  They're milking this poor thing for everything it's worth.  It's terrible.  Well, let's ask George.  George, do you have any opinions on that?  Yeah, take that little Cuban kid by the ankles and smash his head on the edge of the sink.  Getting rid of him already.  Hey, smash that Cuban skull into some porcelain. 
[01:55:30]  Stick him in a coffee cup and float him back to Cuba.  That's a little harsh.  That's a little harsh, George.  Easy, right?  Oh, easy.  What do you really think?  Well, what do I think?  No, not you.  Who cares about you?  I'm just kidding.  No one cares about what I think.  I thought that Janet Rito had to send these guys in with the machine guns and everything.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, as a Jewish guy, I've got to tell you, one thing strikes fear into the  hearts of every Jew. 
[01:56:00]  Two words.  Miami relatives.  That was good.  Aren't you supposed to be working?  Why the hell are you calling to show up?  What the hell are you doing for your district?  Calm down, George.  You're a fucking blocker.  Wow.  I'm going to call all the Anthony.  All right.  Wow, the pup is really pissed that you're on the line, Jared.  I know.  I'm competing with a pup and I'm taking away his face.  What can I say?  Hey, listen.  Anthony, happy birthday.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  I ran into your brother-in-law, you know. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, really?  Which one?  I didn't get his name.  He was at the one who liked the Mets.  It was opening day at the Mets.  Oh, Johnny.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, good.  He came over to me.  He recognized me right away.  He did?  I don't even know what the hell you look like.  I'm the guy with the train track down his back.  That's what happens when you get hit with a train.  Never mind.  I take it back.  Hang up on the Jewel Congressman. 
[01:57:00]  Don't get Luca Bracci.  The Jewel Congressman from the other district.  They're not murderers.  Hey, listen.  Is that puppet vote?  No.  On election day, I stay home and masturbate.  That's a vote for myself.  Get the Jewel Congressman in the other district.  Thank you for the birthday wish there, Congressman.  You're very welcome. 
[01:57:30]  Yes, I'm not that enough today.  You're very welcome.  You owe me a beer.  I couldn't make it the other night.  This is 6,000 times a day.  Happy birthday.  I bet you're sorry you told him it's your birthday now.  You're right, George.  This cold pizza.  Happy birthday.  Ugh.  That's an envelope with some cash in it.  Cold pizza.  Does he look hungry to you?  George is very mad at Jeff Norris for bringing just pizza and beer.  Oh, he looks so happy walking up with the pizza and the beer. 
[01:58:00]  Look at me.  All right.  Look at me holding this all by myself with my big arms.  All right.  He's in good shape.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Gary.  You're very welcome.  You speech.  Put the Jewel Congressman in a headlock.  You have very bad timing, Gary.  Okay.  Listen, tell Otto I'm going to cut you on your strings over there.  Okay. 
[01:58:30]  He's going to be a knock on this guy already.  All right.  No, no.  Come on.  All right, Gary.  Thanks.  Okay, buddy.  Thank you.  There he goes, Gary.  Bye-bye.  Confusing George with a marionette.  What a dull, useless guy that was.  Sean, what's going on?  Nothing much, guys.  What's going on with you?  We're hanging out with Otto and George.  They're performing at Rascals in West Orange Sunday at 8 o'clock.  Oh, I know.  I was just talking to Spaz, and the lines are going nuts there.  It took me 20 minutes to get through.  Got my reservations.  I am all set to go.  See, Otto and George. 
[01:59:00]  Nice.  All right.  I guess you guys can go home.  You did your job.  Thanks, pal.  All right, Sean.  All right.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Thank you.  Well, I guess they could leave.  They did their job.  They come on to their show.  It's going to sell out now.  Yeah, it rocks.  See, George, you don't have to hang out anymore.  Who is that congressman?  Where does he work?  I don't even know.  You don't?  No.  He's not a regular?  He's in Nassau County.  Yes, ma'am.  Hi, first-time caller.  I'm the Jew congressman.  It's cold in here.  Throw a Jew in the fire. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He likes that.  Hey, it's cold in here.  Throw a Jew in the fire.  Oh, my God.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, jeez, come on.  George, don't you want to be back at our show someday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was not cold.  It's all right.  What a bitter, bitter puppet.  Very bitter.  Something must have happened in this childhood.  I thought I made Gilligan look like Sherman Hemsley.  Get the Jew congressman from the other district.  We're not murderers. 
[02:00:00]  From The Godfather, right?  Of course.  One of our favorite movies, George.  We like when people quote The Godfather.  Oh, my God.  That could be some of the most inappropriate stuff I've ever heard on this show.  Yeah, but it came from a puppet.  I mean, what can I tell you?  Of course.  That's our out.  It comes from the puppet.  It's okay.  I don't figure that out a long time ago.  Yeah.  You have to get the venom out somehow. 
[02:00:30]  You know, it's either this or, like, go to a batting range.  You know, you have to somehow get the aggression out.  You can't just go through life, you know, saying rotten things to people, even though you can think them, you know.  Yeah.  By a puppet.  By a puppet.  By a puppet.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you seem like a pretty laid-back guy, you know.  Yeah, it's a strange way to make a living.  I mean, I feel weird when I do it, but I mean, I get big laughs and people seem to love it.  You know, I get bored by my own material, but, you know, you just keep going.  You have to do the same act, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Well, there's a couple of people on the line that want to ask George a couple of questions. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Jesus.  George, you want to answer a couple of questions before I leave?  You're on the air.  All right.  Here you go.  I'm taking all the gorilla boys.  That's all right, George.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're talking to Otto and George, playing Rascals West Orange, Sunday at 8 o'clock.  You're on the air, Jim.  Get a job.  Jim?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Not too bad.  Okay.  Hey, this show is so much better when it's uncensored, I'm telling you.  Oh, you can hear it on the telephone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The people on hold get to hear the uncensored version of this. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  So do you have a question for George?  How old a man are you, sir?  Huh?  How old are you, sir?  Forty.  Forty?  You still get a kick out of cursing?  Oh, did I curse?  I'm sorry.  Hello.  Hey, listen, George, let me ask you a question.  How do you pick up women?  I mean, you go up to them and say, look, let me show you my pet woodpecker or what?  I'm like a, oh, yeah.  I'm that old man.  No, I'm actually very romantic.  I like to go, like, Valentine's Day.  I get up really early, buy a dozen long stem roses, pick up a hooker in Midtown and strangle 
[02:02:00]  her and dump her in the Hudson.  What do you usually do?  A retarded mystic calling this show?  I'm 40.  I like it when the show's dirty.  Okay, terrific.  Sunday at Rascals, 8 o'clock show, right?  Yeah.  Phone number's 973-736-2726.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  We have one more call here.  Joanna.  Joanna, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  So, uh, happy birthday, Anthony.  Well, thank you, Joanna.  Way to go, Joanna.  Okay, later.  Brush your teeth with my...  Oh.  George.  George, did you forget we're on the radio again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Added to the 42nd thing.  I don't know.  They said...  Oh, that's okay.  They said, don't go...  Don't say it that often, just once in a while. 
[02:03:00]  Well, let's ask the Joe Congressman in another video.  Well, oh, my God.  We want to thank Ottawa and George for stopping by.  Thank you.  Yeah, guys, thank you very much.  Thank you.  This is a huge treat.  We are huge fans of yours.  When the weather gets better, we'll come up in short pants and just hang out.  Nobody wants to hear from you.  Calm down, George.  I'm going to give the plug now. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Okay.  Quiet for the plug.  Otto and George, Rascal, Sunday night.  One show, 8 o'clock show.  You're crazy not to go.  Yeah.  We'll probably go again.  Yeah.  We love Otto and George.  West Orange.  Ticket's going fast.  973-736-2726.  We have that number here if you need it, okay?  Right.  Thanks for the plug.  Yeah, no problem.  Hey, that 12-pack of Meisterbrow is a nice touch.  You won't leave Jeff alone.  He won't.  He's rough. 
[02:04:00]  He's rough.  We'll see Sunday.  George, any final thoughts?  Why am I looking at a puppet?  Final thoughts?  No, it's just great to be up here and final thoughts?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What about that JFK Jr.?  Uh-oh.  Don't talk about that.  That's old stuff.  You want to leave with a JFK Jr. thing?  Yeah.  A little commentary on JFK Jr.?  Yeah, that was a shock.  I thought they drowned their bitches one at a time.  Oh, God.  Hi, Mom. 
[02:04:30]  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Mom.  All right.  Otto and George stopping by for Anthony's birthday.  A big, huge surprise.  That was awesome.  Thanks, man.  Happy birthday.  How pathetic am I?  I had a mic on for George the whole time.  I've got to give him headphones.  Next, we're going to give you your own headphones, George, okay?  Thanks.  All right.  Headphones.  Thank you.  Otto and George, once again, rascals.  West Orange, Sunday night at 8.  It's going to sell out, so call ASAP and try to get your tickets, okay? 
[02:05:00]  Right.  All right.  Very cool.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I mean, you're never going to amount to anything.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Very, very offensive.  It's all of a train to the airwaves.  I cannot believe that those morons are on the air.  I don't know, Anthony.  I think this is better than a rock block, don't you?  Only half is nauseating.  I'll tell you why they watch UPN Channel 9 News.  Why?  To see if any of the live reporters are going to get wowed.  That's the best reason to, yeah? 
[02:05:30]  Every night at 10 o'clock, I just go around the channel,  see if any of our wackos are out there with their wow signs.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  It makes watching the news fun again, Anthony.  Yeah.  Timeout New York.  Brand new sponsor to the O&A show.  Got to love Timeout New York if you want to figure out what the hell you want to do in the city.  Find yourself in New York City.  You're with a group of your friends.  You're saying, what do you want to do?  I don't know.  What do you want to do?  I don't know.  It's a big city.  It's kind of hard to keep track of what to do.  Timeout New York.  Great guide to what's going on in this city. 
[02:06:00]  The cool stuff to do.  Not like an old fuddy-duddy guy.  I'm going to go to the Statue of Liberty.  They're touristy things.  The top of the World Trade Center.  Woo-hoo!  Everyone knows that stuff.  Yeah, screw that.  Leave that for the rubes.  This will tell you the cool clubs, cool places to eat, things to do.  Yeah, it's on every newsstand.  It's the Obsessive Guide to Impulsive Entertainment.  They have articles every week as well, Anthony.  This week they're featuring a guide to bike riding in New York City. 
[02:06:30]  A lot of people have bikes but don't know where to take them in this fine city of ours,  so they help you out with that.  Also, they have a sexpert in Timeout New York.

Opie and Anthony, their brains are in their pants.  1027-WNEW.  It's the O&A Show, 212-757-1027. 
[02:07:30]  1027-1027 is our phone number.  Foundrymusic.com checking in, Anthony.  Yes.  The unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  We got video of Marvin Scott and the wow sign from Channel 11 Monday night on the unofficial O&A website.  Under Files 5.  The one that started the brawl between the police, the camera crew for Channel 11.  I'm waiting for Marvin to start throwing blows.  You know, Marvin just got so pissed off. 
[02:08:00]  He's in his live shop.  Here we are live on...  Oh, son of a bitch, you bastards.  Yeah.  I'll get you, Psycho Mark.  And then you see Stinky and Psycho Mark running all over the place while Marvin Scott's trying to do his live broadcast.  Chasing him.  It's good.  The video's up on foundrymusic.com, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Rick's checking in one last time.  I believe there's still a Penn Station with the wow stickers.  Hey, look at her.  He's a cutie.  Hey, hey.  He's a cutie.  Oh, boy. 
[02:08:30]  Bring these friends.  Here you go.  Sounds like something to hear on Z100.  I swear to God.  You speak English.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, everyone.  Oh, here we go.  We have our wacky van crew.  Yeah, look at that.  What country do you play?  Oh.  Let's close it.  Bring these back to Green Bay and rip them all over the place.  Oh, ho.  Waxzainerific.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful people.  What are they doing?  I'm embarrassed.  Rick, where are you? 
[02:09:00]  You got them there fresh and tasty.  They're beautiful.  Just do it.  Yeah.  Enough of that.  What did you hear on Z100?  Did we call our van or was that Z100's van?  We're doing wacky bits.  Did our signals get crossed with Z100's van or something?  A couple of people's names get in the paper.  They get all pumped up.  Oh.  What a mess.  They're out there with the WOW van somewhere with the brand new WOW sticker.  Remember that?  I apologize for that.  We used to call and it was like, 
[02:09:30]  Hi, guys.  I'm here with the WOW stickers.  A lot of fans showing up.  It's a good time.  If you want your stickers, come on down.  We've got 20 to hand out.  Now it's like,  You're on the air.  It was over the top.  That's the problem.  They're like,  They're calling back.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, Rick. 
[02:10:00]  Yo.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  You're live in the air, Rick.  Oh, okay.  What's going on?  All right.  We're here.  We're still on the 34th Street entrance.  Yes.  Yes.  Doing our wacky stuff.  And a lot of people stopping by?  Oh, yeah.  Look at how bad.  We've got lots of people stopping by.  We still haven't gotten a ticket yet.  That's good.  Where are you?  Right on 34th and, what is that?  7th Avenue.  Okay.  Right on the corner.  Right on the corner.  You're in the WOW van.  Right on the corner.  You're handing out the brand new WOW stickers, right? 
[02:10:30]  A lot of brothers enjoying the WOW stickers.  All right.  Very good.  We like our African brothers to be enjoying the whole WOW thing.  What was that wacky thing going on about a minute ago when you called us?  I don't know.  I couldn't even hear you guys.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, maybe...  Mark was talking.  Oh, I see.  Maybe you both shut up for a minute.  I want a limo!  Jesus.  His head has exploded.  All right, man.  All right.  We'll see you guys in a bit.  We're going to be here for like 10 more minutes.  All right.  Have you given out a lot of stickers?  We've almost gone through an entire freaking box. 
[02:11:00]  Nice.  And I don't even know how many are in here.  Probably, what, 3,500?  Get out.  So we're giving them out.  People are driving up.  One guy pulled up.  He just got through the tunnel as quick as he could to get here.  Right.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah, just pull up next to us.  We're handing them out on both sides of the van.  34th Street and 7th Avenue outside Penn Station as you head home.  Grab your WOW stickers.  Another 10 minutes.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  All right.  Bye.  Much better.  People are getting, but they're getting like to a point where we can't even deal with  them anymore.  I know.  I know.  A couple more articles like that today. 
[02:11:30]  It's going to be unbearable.  That was a little better.  Spaz freaking out that we were giving out his last name.  He's yelling at John.  Did you see the yelling match?  Yeah.  Between Spaz and John the Dump Guy?  Yeah.  Like when Spaz was saying, dump out of my last name.  Dump out of it, John.  Because we wouldn't dump out when we said his last name.  Kevin.  Well, I won't say Martin.  But he's yelling.  He's yelling, dump out of my name.  Yeah.  And of course, John's not going to dump out of his name.  He only dumps out of things deemed objectionable by the FCC. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  So John comes up to say hi to us, and Spaz is yelling at him outside.  What the F didn't you dump out?  Spaz has an attitude.  Because his name was first when it came to Spaz, Stinky, and Psycho Mark in the post today.  I'm so glad they're following our lead and not getting big heads.  That's good.  That's what we need.  That's good.  That's wonderful.  All right, Anthony.  What else is happening?  We've talked about just about everything today.  212-757-1027 if you want in on anything today. 
[02:12:30]  I guess we can mention McCain.  Yeah, that's an interesting little tidbit in the paper today.  John McCain made his little failed bid for the presidency.  Wait a minute.  I've got to put someone in their place.  Oh, boy.  Rick.  I dumped out.  Don't worry, Spaz.  Look at Spaz getting to the window.  I dumped out.  Calm down.  I dumped out.  He's a freaking lunatic, man. 
[02:13:00]  All right, anyway.  Yeah, we're going to need a vacation already.  We just took one.  We're going to need one away from our crew.  Oh, no, and I think we've gone four weeks without taking a day off.  This is a brand-new record for the opening of the Anthony show.  We've got to keep this streak going.  Yeah, John McCain.  Wow.  I saw the footage on TV.  Is he nuts or what?  John McCain, we all know the story.  He's an American hero.  He was tortured at the Hanoi Hilton, right?  Right.  Over there in Vietnam. 
[02:13:30]  North Vietnamese.  Had him a prisoner.  And everyone doing stories because it's been 25 years.  So what does McCain decide to do?  He decides to go back to Vietnam.  What, is he nuts?  Not only back to Vietnam, back to the same cell that he was held in, in the POW camp.  That's like going back to a bad marriage years after you get a divorce.  Yeah, right?  Why would you do it?  Why put yourself through the agony?  Why would you do that?  He flies halfway around the world to probably get depressed. 
[02:14:00]  The cell he was in where he was beaten, tied up, bottom of his feet smacked with bamboo shoots.  Mm-hmm.  With bamboo.  And his shoulder's broken, his face pummeled, and he goes back.  He goes back.  Like you're visiting your old neighborhood when you get a new car or something.  When you're a kid, you get your first car.  What do you do?  You drive around your old neighborhood.  To show it off?  Right.  What is he showing off, though?  Well, he brought his son, I guess.  His son, Jack, 13.  His son, in the picture on the paper, was walking in the cell like,  Oh, Jesus, no wonder Dad's such a son of a bitch. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  You know?  Oh, you got to stay in here.  Oh, good, Dad.  Thanks for locking me in my room.  Yeah, I think you'd understand now.  So you think John McCain was in his old cell and just kind of sitting there and reflecting a little bit at him?  Son.  Son, this is where I stayed for many years in the war.  I remember being in this very cell when the gooks came in.  That's what we called them, son.  The gooks.  They'd come in and smash me in the face. 
[02:15:00]  What did I smuggle in here in my pocket?  Hey, hey, Mr. Vietnamese guy.  Take that!  Gooks!  Take it, Gooks!  The contribution!  Slate the eyes!  Yellow Gooks!  Help me to get!  Ah!  Cover me, son!  I'm going to take the short one.  See him there, the yellow one behind the rock.  I think you make it, besties! 
[02:15:30]  Oh, look!  Gook, baby!  Gook, baby!  Watch out for the gooks.  He could have a grenade.  Gook, women!  Don't trust them!  I will remember you.  Oh, what?  Oh, yeah.  It's the year 2000.  I will remember me. 
[02:16:00]  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Gook, kids!  Gook, babies!  Die, Gook, babies!  Claymores!  I'm going to go back.  Wow.  I almost felt like I was there, Elfie. 
[02:16:30]  That's a haunting tribute song you played for his return to Vietnam.  Well, this actually is the song they used in that Columbine video,  which is just a twisted thing going on in Colorado.  Did you hear about this one?  Yeah, they took this song.  They took this song and put it on a video of the scene of the massacre.  Yes.  So they got footage of the library that is just, I mean, it just, look.  Oh, my God.  Who? 
[02:17:00]  Who's putting this video out?  What, the fire department or something?  They're selling copies for 25 bucks.  They got, like, the video of the library where there's bloodstains and books and just everything  shattered all over the place.  And this song is playing in the background.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then they got, like, some mom was really outraged.  She was on TV. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Because in the video, I guess, they have somebody dragging her daughter's body across the lawn.  To the video?  And on the video to this music?  Yes.  Oh, see, that's kind of like, ugh.  And for $25, anyone can buy a video showing an empty, bullet-riddled Columbine High School  after the massacre a year ago.  And the footage comes with a pop music soundtrack.  Oh.  That's creepy. 
[02:18:00]  The tape is three hours long, primarily aerial footage from the day of the attack,  showing the wounded and the bodies of two slain students.  What could that tape possibly be for?  That is nuts.  Who's making money off of it?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I don't know.  I'm sure they'll delve into this.  So.  Try to figure that out.  Hmm.  That's like, that's, that's out there. 
[02:18:30]  Yeesh.  I wonder if they used your brother's song.  They did have, uh.  Yeah, now that they should have used.  They did everything in perspective.  They did have, uh, pop music playing.  Yeah.  You think they were playing your brother Joe's song?  Uh, somehow I doubt that.  Yeah.  Although it does put the whole thing in perspective and shows what, uh, uh, fiends the two were.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Doesn't glorify it or anything.  No, not at all.  No.  This is what, uh, Anthony's brother Joe came up on. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, no.  Here's Dylan who liked an M-16  With high-capacity magazines  When Eric liked to build her bombs and raise an all-and-wil-tong  What a crazy pair  They were killers  Yes, iconic villains all the way  Shot up their school in Trench Coast  One year ago today  While Dylan picked out a chocolate spick 
[02:19:30]  An ebbing Jew  Who's some religious chick  Well, Eric goes out of control  He's shy enough  So maybe he knows  What a couple of pricks  They were killers  Yes, iconic villains  And you're fine  They walked the line  They walked the line  They must have been held up too tight  And they took their own lives  They were killers  Lose that combine  Opie and Anthony 
[02:20:00]  1027 WNEW  And our phone number, 212-757-1027  Anthony, uh, big show tonight  Yeah, real big concert tonight  I don't think a lot of people know about this show tonight  What is it?

[02:22:00]  I was gonna, we were gonna go back to that  You think we were gonna do  20, 30 minutes on Bon Jovi?  It was a quick little joke  And I get yelled at  At the beginning of the show  Rick's telling me  Why are these people waiting online  We switched subjects  And then I, so I hang up on them  Because I get yelled at  Because we switched subjects  It wasn't like the phones were on fire  With other people trying to get through  You had four calls  No one else calling in  They had something that they wanted to talk about  One lady wanted to complain about  The Columbine song we just played  We should give her that right  And you hang up on everybody  But I, a couple people had copies of the video  I wanted to see what the video's all about 
[02:22:30]  I get yelled at about the same thing before  When I went the other way  Now I'm going the other way  And now you're yelling at me  Which way do you want me to do it?  If I leave them online  Then I get yelled at  If I don't leave them online  I get yelled at  Use your head  It wasn't like the phones were exploding  And we needed to make room  They were sitting there comfortably  Waiting for us to talk to them  It was the same situation before  And Rick told me hang up on them  Because  So if the people that had the Columbine video  Please come back  I want to see what it's all about 
[02:23:00]  They're just going  They're just going  Okay brother  That's the argument you just heard  Well  But Ed, what would you rather do?  Seriously  So bad 
[02:23:30]  Maybe stay on the Columbine thing a little bit  It's a big story in the news  Or talk about Bon Jovi for a half hour  Let's see  Tough decision there  Like I could care less Bon Jovi's at the trade wins  I was like  Who cares?

Hey ONA  How's this going man?  Alright what do you have?  Yeah the inside scoops  I live down in Jersey Shore  I drive for Destiny Transport  And supposedly Bruce and Southside Johnny are going to be opening up for Bon Jovi  That's a lie  No  I'm telling you guys

[02:29:30]  And it was edited  By a guy in the  Columbine Fire Department  And what's its purpose  It was made to  As like an instructional tape  For other police  It was supposed to be  Supposed to be  That's a crock of ass  Well I don't know  That's what I said about it  Instructional video  Yeah  It was like evidence  Gathering  And you know  And like how you're  Supposed to deal with all that  Alright so why are they  Making this video  Available  Available  I don't know  For $25 a pop  Yeah  I thought it was just  That you could get it  At Columbine 
[02:30:00]  Like if you were there  When they were selling  And you can buy it  But I don't know  I'm sure that's going to be  On the internet  By the end of the week  Oh yeah  It's all over the place  I'm hearing like  There's mp3s and stuff  I mean is it available  At the local blockbuster  Or something  It's twisted  Yeah  And they're claiming  It's some instructional video  Yeah  They say that  Well the police department  Put it out as  You know  But it's inter-police  You know  Like they're supposed  To look at it  So they can get  You know  Like to see all the  The way the evidence  Laid out 
[02:30:30]  And all that stuff  So why did they  Put the music to it  That's the  The guy in the fire department  Had done that  They had somebody  In the  You know  In the  In the department  Make it  And that's the big problem  Is that everybody's  Freaking out  Because he put  The music to it  Hmm  Alright  I guess they thought  It would be kind of  Better than just silence  Or something  I don't know  It's not a smart move  They might as well  Just had ACDC  Play in the background  Shoot the thrill  Aww  No I'm serious  It's sick  You know  That Sarah McLachlan song 
[02:31:00]  Is annoying  As it is  Don't need it  As the  You know  The song that's playing  While they're showing  The Columbine  Aftermath  I guess they probably figured  Okay we're going to  Catch some flack  Right  For putting  These people on video  And the scene on video  Anyway  So if we put  The I will remember you  Song in the background  It'll almost seem like  We're downplaying it  And trying to make it  Like a tribute  To them  You're going to remember  Them getting shot  You're not going to 
[02:31:30]  Remember them  You know  That's not right  Nah that's a crock  I want to know  Who's getting the money  And what they're going  To use it for  Yeah that's a  That's a good question  Alright man thanks  Alright guys  Thanks Hermes  Later  Or Hermes  What's your name  Hermes  Hermes everyone  Hermes  Jack from the city  Keep this quiet  I just learned  Stone Temple Pilots  Are at Irving Plaza  Elvis is the opening act  Wow really  Yeah  Alright  Heard it here first  Hey Tim  What's going on  Hey guys  How are you 
[02:32:00]  Great  Alright  I heard  I've seen a movie  It's not exactly that one  But it's called  Duck the Carbine High Massacre  Which is a total  Like making fun of  Everything about Columbine  By two college kids  In New Jersey  You might have heard  Of them getting arrested  For bringing firearms  Onto the school grounds  A few months back  Nah  No  If you go to  Duck2k.com  You can see all the stuff  About it  And it's  You know  They make the Bible  Go  You know  They blow her head off  And all that stuff  I know 
[02:32:30]  I'm probably  Sound like a crappy caller  But I'm sorry  At least you identified it  As that  Well  Syndication never  Because of this crap  So  See you later  No  It's called  Syndication Underground  Oh yes  Underground  I'm in that  Over and out  Diamond Dust  Alright bye  One more on this  And then we'll  Change subjects  Spaz did know  To hang up  Manny what's up  I guess Spaz  Is right on the callers  But anyway  Listen  I was listening  To that other  Fine WNEW show  This morning  The sports guys 
[02:33:00]  And they were  Talking about it  Yeah Scott and Sid  Sure  Yeah I don't know  If it was a caller  Or an instant feedback  Whatever  But they said  That they made  The video  So they wouldn't  Catch any litigation  Cases  Or some kind of  Stuff like that  So they wouldn't  Get sued  I don't know  It didn't make  Any sense to me  Either but  That's what  They were saying  But here's my  Theory on the thing  Man I think  They needed some  New police cars  And some new  Fire trucks  They're like  Hey

[02:35:00]  And they deny everything  And then they just  Give me a bunch of crap  To read about strikes and stuff  Yeah I don't know what the hell  They're doing for me  That's all I know  I don't know what they do for me  I don't know what they're doing for me  See I don't know  You guys are after  I don't know  I'm in SAG  I just got the thing in the mail  I opened it up  I was like  Accept no commercial work  Blah blah blah  The dues we pay to this union  I swear to God  I could feed a family of four  For a year  We should be getting oral favors  Oral favors  And so then I  I send in like  You know  A simple little bill  I got my teeth cleaned 
[02:35:30]  Or you know  A chiropractor bill  And they deny everything  So I don't know  Why I'm paying them  All this damn money  Yeah  If they figure you're in radio  What do you clean teeth for  And meanwhile  The people that work for CBS  And aren't in any union  They get benefits anyway  Through the company  So we would get benefits anyway  Yeah  But for some reason  We got to pay  No  Tons of money  The point I'm making is  I haven't seen any benefits  Yeah that's what I mean  See I don't even get benefits  Because with SAG  You have to make  A certain amount  And I can't get anyone  On the phone  I don't even know what it is 
[02:36:00]  No one  And I've been here two years  All we know is  They pretty much put a gun to our head  Say pay union dues  And you try to get a representative  On the phone  To tell you  You know  What you get for your money  And your dues  I don't know nothing  I have not a clue  What they're doing  They have done nothing for me  I call them up  I sit on hold for an hour  I send in bills  That you know  I'm hoping they might pay for me  Because I pay all this money  To the union  No  They deny everything  So I don't know what they do  They send you the letter  With the bill in it  To send them more money  Wow  See I haven't even gotten  That far with them yet 
[02:36:30]  Oh it's a blast  I have no clue  No I'm just wondering  Whether they're going to let you  Do live reads or not  I'll do whatever the hell  We've been doing on this show  I could give a flying F  About a strike or anything  Someone's saying  How can you bash a union  Well maybe your union's good  I really don't know  What my union's all about  When they do something for me  Maybe I'll change my mind  I don't know  One of the reps  Is trying to get through right now  If there's anyone  Well this would be  This would be good  Maybe we'll finally get to talk to someone  I'm being honest  I have no freaking idea  What they do for me 
[02:37:00]  You know  I know I pay a lot of money  Pay my F in debt this bill  And I won't read a lot of reads  I know I pay a lot of money  And I'm not bashing every union  So relax on the phone lines  I'm sure there's some unions out there  That do a fine job for the people  I am talking about my personal experience  And I have no freaking clue  What they do  Well it's still going on  I just left the web page  And it's still going to happen on Monday  So I would appreciate  If a representative of this fine union  Would give me a call  And explain exactly 
[02:37:30]  What I'm supposed to get  Let's talk to Puppet Head Mike  Who obviously  If we're bashing  Puppet Head Mike  Our own union  And he says  How can you bash any union  He's just blind faith  Blindly following  Just because it's a union  Alright Billy  Thank you  You're alright guys  Later on  Alright  Mike what's going on  Puppet Head Mike  Puppet Head Mike  What's going on guys  Hey hello  First of all  Hello  Yeah go ahead  First of all  You know you're sitting there bashing the union 
[02:38:00]  Talking about you don't know what they do for you  If they weren't around  Then you would know  What is it  Management can just take advantage  You do whatever they want  Just push you around  They do it anyway  They do it anyway  And I have a contract  So what the hell are they going to do  Against my contract  Well imagine if you didn't have them  How bad it would be  What they've done nothing for me  I don't  We're talking about our union Mike  Maybe your union's great  That's great  I'm not against unions in general 
[02:38:30]  But I know the one I'm currently in  I have no freaking idea what they do for me  And no one around here will tell me what they do for me  I can't get a representative on the phone  I'm on hold for two hours  I send in bills and stuff that supposedly should be paid  I get nothing  And we pay a lot of money for them  And we pay  You take a trip and you go down to the union  You go down to the office  And you get some answers  What are they going to do  Block the doors from you  You run away  You go down there  You pay them a visit  And you get everything straightened out  You have to get involved  Because you just can't like  Pending your bill  And you're like  I try to get involved 
[02:39:00]  I call  There's a number you call  I've written stuff  I said please someone  You know talk to me  What the hell is going on  I want to know what  You know what you guys are doing for me  If I'm spending all this money  To be in a union  I want to know what I get  I understand that  If you don't get  When you go to a doctor  For a simple check up  And you have to pay the entire amount  After you're paying union dues  I think there might be a problem there  Maybe I'm doing something wrong  But I can't get anyone on the line  And tell me what to do  Listen 
[02:39:30]  If you can't get the answer you want  You write to the board of trustees  And they have to reply  They have to reply  The board of trustees  Thank you Mike  You're just going to get me more pissed off  I'm sure your union's fine  I'm not talking about  No I mean you have  You have to bitch and complain about it  I'm bitching right now  And you got answers  I don't know what they do for me  Thank you  Thank you Mike  Alright later guys  I don't think they've done anything for me  I don't think they've done anything for me  Anthony's a union guy  He's been in unions his whole life 
[02:40:00]  28 mofo  That's right  At least it made sense  With tin knockers  And then if I don't pay my dues  They start threatening me  With stuff  I'm like oh my god  Calm down  I'll give you more money  Jesus  The union rep would come in  Talk to your management  As far as the management went  With tin knocking  And they would hammer out a deal  And that's what you would get  Now as far as we're concerned  Our agent comes in  Hammers out a deal with management  Signs a contract  And the station has to abide by the contract 
[02:40:30]  If they renege on that  Then the union is supposed to step in  It's a contract  I could hire a freaking lawyer to step in  Right  I don't care  For probably less than  The union dues are  I don't know what they do  They're not doing anything for me  I'm not striking  I don't even know what that's about  I get things from them  I throw them away  I get so much paperwork  And envelopes  From the  Whatever  Don't get me started  But if there's a representative  That's listening  Maybe this is a way  Where you can finally 
[02:41:00]  You know  Contact us  And talk to us  Because we have no clue  We've been here two years  Yeah  Yeah  Good chance to get involved  Right about now  I'd rather send the money  To a family that needs it  Jesus  Lord knows I could feed  A family of four  I'm serious  For the money I paid  Yeah  I'm a little tired  Of writing checks  And sending them to people  That aren't doing anything for me  Steve  What's up?
