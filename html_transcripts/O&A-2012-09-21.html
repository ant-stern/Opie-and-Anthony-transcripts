<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with crude, sexually explicit banter from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, sparked by the release of the iPhone 5 and the absurdity of people lining up for days to purchase it.  The hosts shared stories of their own line-cutting exploits, employing deceptive tactics to avoid waits.  Norton recounted a seven-hour iPhone 4 wait, leading to humorous, graphic stories about unconventional urination. E-Rock’s story about defecating on the LIE was also recounted.  A Sam Roberts segment featured interviews with iPhone 5 line-waiters, highlighting their absurd dedication and lack of self-awareness, including an interview with Greg Packer, a notorious line-stander. The discussion branched into the re-sale market for limited-edition sneakers.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a convenience store robbery solved by the robber's sneakers and fingerprints on a beer can.  Upcoming segments were previewed, including more iPhone 5 line-waiter audio, an interview with an Occupy Wall Street participant, and the in-studio appearances of JBL (a wrestler climbing the seven highest peaks on seven continents), Joe DeRosa, David Tell, and Bill Burr.  A repetitive, vulgar chant involving "Mimi Beardsley" punctuated by sexually explicit remarks followed.  The hosts then launched into a discussion about the strangeness of childbirth from a caveman's perspective, expanding to the vastness of space, extraterrestrial life, and the inconsistencies of religious beliefs, particularly focusing on Genesis.

An interview with an Occupy Wall Street participant waiting for an iPhone 5 who planned to sell his place in line to donate to causes opposing Apple's labor practices followed, met with skepticism from the hosts.  This was followed by an interview with a woman who demonstrated a surprising lack of knowledge about the iPhone 5's features.  The hosts discussed intrusive television advertising before the arrival of more guests was announced.

Joe DeRosa joined the studio to discuss his co-authored book, "A Man's Guide to Infidelity," leading to a heated argument with Troy Kwan, a staff member, fueled by a previous on-air conflict.  Bill Burr’s arrival escalated the argument further. JBL briefly appeared, commenting on the ensuing chaos.

A segment with JBL focused on his seven summits challenge, his encounters with great white sharks and running with the bulls, and the difficulties of climbing Everest, including mentioning "Green Boots." Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, and David Tell joined, promoting their book and film, "A Man's Guide to Infidelity." A troubled phone call with Colin Quinn ensued.

The show delved into the difficulties of being president, from security details to constant demands, contrasting with the frustrations of everyday life. The DeRosa-Kwan argument reignited, featuring mutual insults, shouting matches, apologies, and attempts at reconciliation facilitated by the hosts. David Attell, promoting his show, participated in the banter. The show concluded with apologies, a forced handshake and hug between DeRosa and Kwan, plugs for upcoming shows, and a Dish Network commercial.  Sam Roberts and Nicole from "Morning Mashup" joined for a post-show segment discussing Nicole's alleged intoxication and a detailed account of a three-way sexual encounter.

A final segment highlighted JBL’s extreme masculinity, contrasting him with other guests. The DeRosa-Kwan argument resurfaced, with Troy expressing regret for not being more aggressive in the initial July incident. Explicit discussions about Nicole’s open relationship and her husband’s alleged infidelity while she was drunk ensued.  Technical difficulties with phone lines and interns were highlighted, with the hosts using highly offensive language to describe their interns.  The show ended with plugs for the show's YouTube and Facebook pages and Troy’s DJ gig.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sew it.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day, every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes.  I will continue.  Anthony, the rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Friday!  Yes, it is.  Look at that energy.  Thank goodness.  Just got to raise your voice.  Friday!  That's all you got to do.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, everybody!  Ho, ho!  Morning.  Hi, everybody.  It's iPhone 5 day. 
[00:02:00]  The excitement.  Palfable.  Palfable.  Amazing.  The lines around the Apple stores.  Did you ever wait online for anything?  For anything?  No.  I don't think I have, either.  I don't think I have.  And years ago, it was what you did to go to concerts.  It was kind of cool.  I never did.  I've waited online like anyone, but not by choice.  Like, these people are choosing to wait online.  Some for 24 to 36 hours. 
[00:02:30]  48 hours in some cases.  More than that.  Oh, man.  Well, those are just the complete idiots.  There's been people there for eight days.  Eight days!  They just don't have anywhere else to go.  That's just stupid.  I don't want to buy Wall Street people.  That's a mental problem.  Yeah.  Because I live close to an Apple store, right?  I mean, the line is ridiculous.  It's going to go...  If it's like this...  If it's the same line I saw for the last product, whatever the last Apple product it was, it'll  go at least three blocks, then around, and all the way back toward the store. 
[00:03:00]  It's a ridiculous line.  And then, a mere day to two days later, you just walk in and get the iPhone 5.  Yeah, then you just get it.  So, I don't get that.  Why would you do that to yourself?  Because you can't watch other people using it and not have it yourself.  Why?  That's crazy.  Why can't you wait just one or two days?  Oh, it's crazy to do that.  Maybe in some cases, three days.  It's Friday.  Maybe you get your iPhone 5 on Monday. 
[00:03:30]  There'll probably be a new one out by then.  Come on.  It's crazy.  Now, that's crazy talk.  I don't understand that.  I don't either.  I really don't.  I mean, unless I had, like, a hookup, you know, where you could go, yo, dude.  Yeah, let me just bypass this line.  I usually do, yeah.  It's called a perk.  We got perks here.  Yeah, yeah.  A little perk.  Unless I got that, I'm not waiting on a fucking line like that.  I really don't understand.  I guess it would be fun for a little while.  You know, you hang, it's a thing, it's an event. 
[00:04:00]  The camaraderie of the iPhone.  Yeah.  Hey, man, make sure no one cuts this.  Yeah.  Make sure no one cuts this line.  We're together here, right?  In solidarity.  Come on, man.  None of you assholes are waiting on line for other people, right?  They're not going to show up.  Oh, sorry.  Do you think they start a list?  What do you mean?  Like, of who is there on line so that if someone gets out of line to go to the bathroom or something,  they could check and say, oh, look, man, we were here.  We could vouch for him. 
[00:04:30]  You got to take a dump.  I can't fucking stand waiting on long lines because you kind of look at people and you  see when they start letting people in.  You look at how long one person takes and then you start doing the math.  Right.  Like, all right, that person took two minutes before they let another person in.  Yeah.  You do that at the DMV a lot.  A hundred people in front of me.  That's a lot of minutes.  Yeah.  At the DMV, like, oh, man.  Oh, my God.  They're only up to E70?  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  When we were in Chicago, we were doing that riverboat tour thing.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  We got our tickets really late.  What do you mean?  The rom-com boat tour?  Yeah, the rom-com boat tour that rolling-balled it.  What a fucking asshole.  He does make me laugh, though.  So we had our tickets, but we got there late, so we're going to have the shittiest seats  on the boat, and we want to get those back two rows of the boat in the sunshine.  The good seats.  So we're all right near the front of the line being, I'm on my phone, and I just start merging  guy.  Oh, you do that like, oh, do-do-do.  Yeah, you make believe you're, like, really deep in thought, trying to write a text. 
[00:05:30]  But you're supposed to be right where you are.  But you can't look at anyone because they all know what you're doing.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we slowly merged.  And there was, like, eight of us, and we all were able to do this.  And people were getting so pissed off.  Because the back of the line was right by the front of the line.  Right.  So, like, we go one at a time.  We just start.  And I think it was the third person.  I don't think E-Rock was able to make it on.  No.  We had to save the seat.  So you all pretty much just stayed back. 
[00:06:00]  No, because E-Rock.  In solidarity of E-Rock.  No, no, no.  We got on real quick.  Yeah.  Real quick.  And people were mad.  And, you know.  Just walk past them.  What are they going to do?  And I'm like, whatever.  Be mad.  But then if it happens to you, you're ready to punch someone.  Yeah, who's a fucking asshole.  That's how that shit works.  We all know it.  We all know it.  I do that at concerts.  Like, getting up to the front, you know?  Yeah.  Like, all these people that get there, like, hours and hours and hours ahead of time.  And then you walk in, you know, 30 minutes before the band goes.  You just, you know, mosey on up to the front.  Well, the thing everyone can relate to when you're talking about that is traffic. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  When there's an off-ramp, an exit that is really crowded.  Right.  And people will wait a mile back on the line.  Right.  And I will always just keep going because someone will always fuck up before I get to the front  of the line.  Oh, yeah.  Someone sleeps for a half second.  That's all it takes.  And you get right in there.  I am, whoa, in there.  Do you ride the on-ramps?  I do everything.  I ride the LIE has nice, long on-ramps.  And if you're bumper-to-bumper traffic, you take a peek, you're like, hmm, I'm going to 
[00:07:00]  make believe I'm going on the highway right now.  I could do this.  So you do the quick right, which pisses off the car in front of you.  But by the time you're way down the line, no one knows you think you're getting back  on.  I mean, you're getting on for the first time.  You only piss off the people that you get out of the line.  Right.  The first one or two know what you're doing like that motherfucker.  But they'll never get, they'll never be up where you are.  But then once you get in that line, you're not letting anybody else in.  Hell no.  Fuck those people.  How dare they?  I'm right on the bumper.  I'm not snoozing. 
[00:07:30]  That long?  That long?  Go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I pulled the ultimate douchebag move on the Verrazano for everybody out there.  It goes from Staten Island into Brooklyn.  And it's a long bridge.  It's really fucking long.  And there's one lane that goes into the belt.  And the other two are for another highway.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I had to go into the one for the belt.  And it was packed with traffic.  And I was like, fuck this.  So I just took it.  I rode it the whole way until right about where it splits.  And then just pretended I saw the sign at the last second.  Oh, I've got to be in that way.  You've got to act in the car.  I'm sorry.  Throw your arms up. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, man.  Oh.  Look, I'm sorry.  It's like 20 minutes.  Yeah.  You've got to just wait for the Asian.  The Asian will slow down.  Oh, they are terrible.  And you'll sneak right in front of them.  No.  They're never on someone's ass.  They're not aware.  They're not aware of these traffic jams.  But I love riding that on-ramp.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  No, I'm just kidding on the highway.  Yeah, look at me.  On a service road.  On a L.A.  On a service road, rocks.  That should be a highway.  I'm a shoulder driver, too.  Are you really?  Fuck yeah.  See, I'm not brave enough to do that yet.  In an Escalade?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  It's crazy.  I pulled a move the other day.  It was a big cloverleaf-type off-ramp.  And it was packed.  And it was the looping around one going onto Old Country Road from the Meadowbrook.  And I looked, and it's just packed.  And it's taking forever.  However, I cut, I got off, I went across the grass.  Oh, dude, that's awesome.  In the circle.  I always wanted to pull that.  Dude, it's the best.  Wow.  I saved fucking, it had to be ten minutes.  Wow.  I get cut right up there.  And then I get to the top. 
[00:09:00]  And people are so shocked that you're coming at them from the grass.  They just let you in.  They don't want to deal with you.  They just assume you're some kind of official.  That's got to be an authority figure.  Yeah, something.  If a cop sees you and pulls you over, you just have to be bashful.  I'll be like, look.  I know.  I know.  Sir, I know.  You know.  Oopsie.  But it brings us back to the iPhone 5.  Would you guys wait in line for the iPhone 5?  That's why I originally came in here.  I did seven hours for the 4. 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  But I didn't plan on it.  Like, when I got in line, they said, yeah, it's going to be about three hours.  And I had done the line for the 3G.  So I was like, yeah, you know, that's about right.  This is about a three-hour line.  And then they start, you know, having trouble with hooking people up, like, with, you know,  their plans.  And one thing leads to another.  And once you're in line for three hours, you can't get out of line.  You've committed at that.  Oh, man.  Plus, you have no idea that you're not halfway done yet. 
[00:10:00]  You think that you're like, okay, one more hour.  Oh, there's, yeah, there's just no rhyme or reason to how long it's going to take.  You don't know.  You think it's going to take shorter.  Seven hours?  Seven hours.  I got home at three in the morning.  Wow.  I have never done that in my entire life.  How did you do that?  Because, like I said, you don't plan on it.  But once you get there, you're committed to doing it.  I couldn't just, I couldn't get out of that line after three hours and say, okay, I'm  going home.  Wow.  How do you, like, piss and shit?  You don't.  Whoa.  You don't even think about it, really. 
[00:10:30]  Like, you really don't.  Yeah, you'll be thinking about that shit in a few more years.  Well, no, because I'm not going to be waiting in any more lines.  I pre-ordered online.  There you go.  Pulling it in is for the young.  Yeah.  I remember the days where I could leave my apartment and not even think that I might  need a bathroom.  Now it's a priority.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Where are all the Starbucks at?  I live like Joe Theismann talking about his fucking prostate and his goddamn pissing  in the stadiums.  I would assume people would just wear Depends and say, fuck it. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I went to Fifth Avenue.  Oh, braggart.  Yeah, well, you know.  Flagship store and all.  Excuse me.  But, you know, you stand in line with the same people for seven hours that if you've  got to get out and take a piss, they're going to know where you are.  They know.  Well, because they're going to need you.  Because they're going to have to take their leak as well.  It's like socialism.  I almost peed in my pants at the Pearl Jam show.  Good for you.  All right.  Good time to bring that up.  Pearl Jam was in the middle of their set.  I was loving it.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't want to leave.  I didn't want to leave my spot and the urinals. 
[00:11:30]  They had plenty of them, but it was a good 15, 20-minute wait, which is easy.  Anyone could do that.  And I'm sitting there like, let me.  I was thinking about it logically.  I'm like, all right.  I drank a lot of water and about four or five beers.  And they start playing even flow.  Now that you've seen them, next time you go, you can take a piss during even flow.  But I'm thinking, I'm like, you know what?  We all know, like, sometimes your pee is pretty fucking pure.  So I'll have wet jeans, but it's kind of rainy anyway. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, no, it's not.  No.  It's never that pure.  I'm talking about the pee where it's pretty clear.  It's just like water.  Not that dark yellow.  I don't want that shit running down my leg.  There's no way you'd take a piss.  I didn't do it.  I mean, I wish I had a good end to the story, but I really was thinking about it.  I'm like, you know what?  How bad would it be?  I'll move my penis to the left.  I'll pee down my left leg.  Hopefully, most of it will leave the fucking jeans.  Plus, you still got the right.  Huh?  You still got the right leg, dry and clear. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but then you're standing there thinking, I just pissed my pants.  But then I'm thinking, that's crazy.  Maybe I could pop out my cock head.  Yeah.  Just the cock head part.  Right.  Just for fun?  And just make believe I'm still standing there enjoying, you know.  But you have to get into pee position.  That's what gives that away.  I like how you said it's kind of raining.  Like, you'd have a soaking left leg.  But it was like, what, guys?  It's raining.  Oh, no, no, no.  I already figured that out because it was dark.  No one would see the piss leg.  I would be the only one dealing with the piss leg. 
[00:13:00]  And your brother-in-law?  He would never know.  I probably would tell him for the goof.  Right.  I would tell him for the goof.  He would laugh.  And it was like an hour left.  So I'm thinking, all right, I'd deal with this for an hour.  I'd get to see Pearl Jam, the rest of the set.  And then I'd fucking get in the cab and go home.  Wow.  Your jeans are sticking to your leg with piss.  Oh, so as soon as I get home, I'd get rid of the jeans, put them in the wash, take a quick shower, go to bed.  How bad is that?  How bad is that?  It says, Opie should move to Haiti.  That's pretty good for a communist. 
[00:13:30]  I'm the only one that thinks about this shit.  Because I had to go so bad.  But then, you know, I was like, this is stupid.  And then I had to fucking go to the urinal.  So as soon as I was.  Yeah.  If I ever see it's drizzling out and someone's got a soaked leg, I'm going to know now.  Yeah.  I'm going to be like, yeah, hey, piss leg.  No, when you're a bit dehydrated.  You know that.  You're piss right in.  When you're a bit dehydrated and it's that dark yellow, that's a different pee, I'm telling you.  That's the ones that smell and shit.  But if it's a water pee or like, you know, some beers. 
[00:14:00]  But see, you don't know.  You don't know until you start pissing, right?  Yeah, you don't.  You never can be positive.  No, but if you're drinking.  I mean, we had a few, like I said, we had four or five beers and a few waters.  A bowl of asparagus and, you know.  That shit's going right through you.  It's not picking up too much stuff inside, I would imagine.  I don't know.  Express through the kidneys.  Let the record show.  I did not pee.  The record does show.  I was a gentleman that day.  I don't know if Pearl Jam was playing in the ocean. 
[00:14:30]  There you go.  That's amazing.  Let's take that shit.  You're swimming?  Fuck.  Drop a deuce just because.  That's an idiot.  Have you ever popped?  I did pop out.  I did pop my cock head out for a Black Crow show once.  Oh.  That goes way back to the BAB days.  Some people do.  Some people take out their lighters.  Some people take out their dickheads.  All right.  Get your cocks out, everyone.  Well, it's a whole formula thing, man.  They're playing free bird.  You know, and I was younger at the time, so I was drinking more than I do now.  So I'm drinking my beers.  I have a great spot for the Black Crows.  It was like one of these secret shows. 
[00:15:00]  And I swear to God, I have no idea where they played.  It was a smaller venue.  And I was maybe 20 to 25 feet from the stage.  I'm like, this is fucking right in the dead center.  But it was one of those where everyone is packed in.  Holy shit.  So how do you piss?  Do you piss on people?  No, no, no.  But then I'm thinking, all right, if I leave, I'm going to have the shittiest fucking seat  in the house.  And I've been waiting for this for weeks.  And I had a couple.  And then we were double fisting, obviously, because we're now we, you know, we had a couple  a couple of road sodas before the show. 
[00:15:30]  And then I grabbed, I double fisted.  So now I'm sitting there waiting for the Black Crows.  And I drank my two beers.  But I got the empty bottles that I, I knew when I emptied the first one, I'm like, you  might need that.  Just save that.  Oh, hold on.  Oh, OK.  So then.  Bottle piss.  So then I did.  I just was able to get just the cock head out and into the bottle.  Nobody noticed.  Then what do you do with the bottle?  Well, that's the problem for everybody else.  Because I casually put it at my feet.  You just put it down and kick it over.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  And I'm telling you, man, there was no room. 
[00:16:00]  I'm like, you could smell everyone's bad breath.  We were so close to each other.  I absolutely did that.  That's a tough piss.  Because you got to line your little cock hole up with the beer bottle neck.  And it's not very big.  You know, the neck is a very big.  You have to be exact.  And then you got to keep checking in on the level.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You panic.  It's just going like, uh-oh.  Because you're not sure.  And you got to make sure that you can cut the flow off before you start pissing all over  the end of the bottle.  Well, the panic is, you're right.  You see the bottle and you see the liquid coming up.  You got to gauge your bladder. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  I can stop right now.  All right.  And then I got the second bottle.  But the problem that night was I had too much.  I filled up both bottles.  No problem.  And I still was a little, you know.  Did you leave to get more beer?  No, I couldn't move at that point.  It was time for the show.  I wasn't going to fuck up my spot.  When it starts going into the bottleneck and the bottleneck.  And you're like, oh, man, it fills up, like, instantly.  You feel the pee on your tip.  Oh, no.  You've peed in cars, right?  As you're driving, stuck in traffic?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I've done that.  Gatorade bottles are the best for that.  Because you can lay your whole.  That's a nice wide mouth.  Oh, you can lay everything right in there.  Right in there.  Right in there.  Just nice.  Just shove.  I put my balls in, too.  Yeah, I was about to say.  Give it the old booyah.  Shove my booyah.  But the problem with peeing in a car is that it's like a kinked hose.  Yeah, you've got to go down.  You've got to, like, there's a science to it, man.  Right?  Yeah, you can't go straight out.  It's like, so you have to get in this weird position.  You've got to, like, get to the edge of your seat. 
[00:17:30]  You're still driving and make sure there's no kinks.  You're hunched over the wheel like you just hit a pole.  Right.  You guys just reminded me of a disgusting story from, like, junior high school.  We were thirsty, so we went to the store for some drinks.  And I do believe we got some snapples.  And then somebody thought it was going to be real fun to piss in the Snapple bottle.  But then it was someone else's bright idea to say, hey, let's return it.  Really?  So we drove back.  And we're like, hey, can we return it?  And they were just like, yeah, what's the matter?  And they were just like, oh, we didn't realize.  And when we grabbed it, it must have been, like, freshly stocked because it's still, it's, like, warm. 
[00:18:00]  It's not cold.  Oh, man.  This Korean cashier is touching on this piss-hot bottle of Snapple.  Going, oh, yeah, yeah, very warm.  Okay.  And then she let us get another one.  That would be a...  That would be a funny video.  I'm pretty sure that piss Snapple went right back up on the...  That would be a funny video, man.  We could pull that one off.  Oh, someone's fucking, like, sweating on the job.  They go in, ugh.  It's nice and cold, piss now.  They open it up and just take that giant gulp.  It's amazing the shit you do when you're a kid that you just don't give a fuck about. 
[00:18:30]  No consequence.  You don't think of consequences.  The other one, I went to a Yankees game.  I was probably in my early 20s.  And you know in the Bronx, the highway that's way the fuck above?  Yeah.  It's just a road.  And you can't walk off the road, obviously.  I had to pee so bad that, you know, you get the cramps to the point, like, you have no choice.  You've got to do something.  You can't hold it anymore.  So I told the guys, I'm like, fucking stop for a second.  And it was bumper-to-bumper traffic as they're going around that long loop, if you know what I'm talking about.  So I got out, and I just literally started peeing right there, as the cars are literally a foot away. 
[00:19:00]  I had no choice.  So much as bad as E-Rock shitting on the side of the LIE.  Oh, yeah.  Shitting.  He didn't shit on the side of the LIE.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you tell the story?  He told it on After Opie and Anthony Live.  It was a while ago.  Thanks, Sam.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Remember when you used to collect shit for our show?  Well.  Nice E-Rock shit story.  What's the story, E-Rock?  I was coming back from Long Island.  It was really late, and I got to the point where the LIE meets the van wick, and I just 
[00:19:30]  couldn't hold it anymore.  Shit.  So I'm not even pissed.  It's shit.  So I pull over, and the van wick comes down, the ramp comes down like this, where it merges  in.  So I pull over to the side, and then back my car in diagonally to the ramp.  Strategic.  So that oncoming traffic on the LIE can't see me, and traffic coming down the van wick can't  see me, just opened the passenger doors to my car, and just had to go.  He made some stuff. 
[00:20:00]  Jesus.  I just left it there like a dog.  Oh my God.  Disgusting.  It's so degrading.  Curb your nagle.  It's so degrading.  Curb your nagle.  Clean up after your nagle.  Curb your nagle.  It's the law.  Everyone's got, everyone has a piss in the car story, or a piss in a concert.  No one has a shit on the side of the road story.  A shit on the side of the road.  Talk to Roland when he gets here.  He's got some good ones.  I can always hold in a shit for the money.  That's a lot different, right?  You got time. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, you know.  No, there's no time on there.  If you shit yourself, it's usually an accident.  Yeah.  It looked like you were throwing paintballs at the side of the wall.  What'd you use to wipe?  God damn.  What did you, I'm sure you did.  How much road did you wipe?  What?  Did you wipe?  Oh, yeah.  I had napkins and, uh, and, uh, the, uh, the, uh, handy wipes.  And a what?  You had baby wipes in the car?  How many?  Yeah.  McChicken wrappers.  How many times do you shit while you're dropping your car that you need baby wipes in there?  Yeah, what is it in your car for? 
[00:21:00]  What the fuck?  You get those travel-sized things from Walmart and throw them in the car.  He's such a consumer.  He really is.  He just loves getting stuff.  Consuming and shitting.  Well, I was gonna get wipes.  But I could buy another pack for the car.  I would never think to take the fucking Walmart baby wipes.  Because if I got a shit on the side of the road, I want to be comfortable.  I went, uh, when I went driving through the desert on vacation last year, I totally remembered baby wipes.  I'm like, I'm not.  Well, that's smart.  I'm not fucking.  Well, that's the desert.  Yeah.  That's different.  Van Wick. 
[00:21:30]  And you know what?  Van Wick.  I did have to shit.  Yeah, you're not almost home.  I had to shit in the salt flats.  It was like 130 degrees, and I was so glad I had those baby wipes.  Oh, man.  What do you think eats your shit after you leave?  In the desert?  The flies.  You think it's just flies?  I was amazed at how much life there was in the desert.  You pop down a good duty, you're going to see how much life there is.  Just coming after you.  They're everywhere.  I've had to shit on job sites and stuff like that, spackle buckets, and it is amazing how quickly the bugs show up.  That is the proverbial dinner bell. 
[00:22:00]  They love it.  They really, they really get there fast.  That plop instead of a ding.  Oh, yeah.  I guess they don't have noses or, well, what's that about?  Yeah.  What do they, how do they, how do they like shit so much?  I don't know.  They just, what's that about?  They love it.  We need someone that knows that shit.  Maybe they have actual noses, but they just love the smell of shit.  I think they have whatever, whatever sense is the smell for them.  I'm calling it noses.  Yeah, they definitely got that.  Yeah, they enjoy the scent.  I mean, honestly, it's just a scent, right? 
[00:22:30]  We've been conditioned to think it's unpleasant.  Horrible.  They love things that are shitty and rotting.  Yeah.  They love it.  All the truckers are calling it.  Relax.  Oh, my God.  We all know that you guys pee and shit wherever the fuck you want.  Yeah, we're talking about normal people.  One guy's like, I got a milk bottle that I have next to me.  Remember that chick?  That shit in a bag and then threw it against the window.  Truckers make E-Rock look like Emily Post out there on the roads.  Can you play the shit in the bag?  Oh.  It is one of my favorite things ever.  That's fucking disgusting. 
[00:23:00]  That was hysterical.  It was like a bag of clay.  You got that, E-Rock?  I don't remember if it was Chicago or Cleveland.  It was one of our recent road trips.  I think about this all the time, but I didn't tell anybody when it happened.  And I don't remember who was in the cab with me, but it was people from the show.  And I sat in the front seat of the cab because the back seat was full.  And so I got in and I was moving the guy's stuff over.  And he had his bottle there.  And I handed it.  I was like, all right, let's move this.  And I was like, it's not cold. 
[00:23:30]  And then I looked.  It was yellow.  Oh, shit.  But it wasn't like warm, warm.  So I was like, okay, well, in my head I'm going, it must be some kind of vitamin water thing.  And then just blocked it out.  You picked up his piss bottle.  I think it was definitely his piss bottle.  Then he looked at it and rolled his eyes and hid it under the papers.  And I was like, oh, no.  Dude, it's his piss bottle.  You might as well have touched his cock.  You fucking just, you blew him.  And I was like, I'm really gay.  I was looking at my hands. 
[00:24:00]  I just wanted to like start knifing off layers of skin.  Gay people are so disgusting.  Paracelum.  It was gross.  Did you hear about it?  He finds a good body.  He's got to keep the bottle.  Yeah, he has to reuse that shit.  So he waits and then pours it out somewhere.  He dumps it out, the piss pours over the side, all over the outside of the bottle.  Right where you touched it?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of like pee flakes. 
[00:24:30]  A lot of like dried pee.  I guarantee you still have his urine on your hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That shit doesn't go away.  You got the AIDS.  Yeah, if it's someone else's, it doesn't go away first.  You ate a sandwich after that?  Oh, shit.  Now it's inside you.  P's in your system.  Hope I didn't have any open like little cat scratches or something.  Oh, boy.  Because then it would get in my body, you tinkle drinker.  You guys are like pee brothers.  Piss pals.  Yeah.  So the iPhone 5.  Yeah.  Oh, that's where we were.  How long are the lines this time around?  Well, as of yesterday afternoon, it was, there was like 15 people there that had been there 
[00:25:00]  for at least, the 15th person had been there for three days.  That was the minimum.  That's so stupid.  The first people had been there for eight or nine days.  Then the second 15 people, as of yesterday, were all Occupy Wall Street people.  Uh-huh.  And they were just like raising, they didn't want any phones.  They were just trying to raise a ruckus.  Yeah.  And then.  Shouldn't they be kicked out then?  Of course they should.  They were admitting that they weren't going to buy phones.  They specifically said, we're just selling our places to whoever to use money for the 
[00:25:30]  cause.  And then.  Oh, good capitalism.  Right.  Exactly.  And then.  They're retarded.  By the afternoon, it started stretching around the block, but I'm sure by now it's.  Are they going to run out of product?  They will.  Not immediately, but they will.  A lot of the smaller stores will immediately run out, but like Fifth Avenue, they usually  get.  Because I know tomorrow in my neighborhood in the morning, there'll be no one at the  Apple store, but they might not have product.  They may run out by tomorrow morning.  Yeah.  They'll be able to go there though, tomorrow, to the big one. 
[00:26:00]  You getting yours today?  You know what?  No.  Oh, well.  I'm busy today.  I'm busy.  I got the.  What's more important than the new iPhone?  You know what?  But a couple days down the road, same thing, right?  Yeah.  And I downloaded the new OS.  How about that Maps app?  Fucking stinks.  It's the worst.  I want fucking the regular Google Maps for fuck's sake.  They took a bunch of time to drive around with a stupid, twirly bird camera on the top  of a car.  They're really getting killed. 
[00:26:30]  Like in the media, there's not a single person that thinks it's a good thing.  Because they have a hard-on for Google, obviously.  Well, you know what?  But their version is shitty.  It's shitty, yeah.  So why don't you wait until you figure that out and then you can make this move?  Yeah.  Because everyone loves Google Maps.  Google has put, like, an insane amount of money in years.  Years of research and money and technology.  Yeah, you can't just say, oh, we're going to do our own Maps and, like.  It doesn't work like that.  No.  There's going to be a war, man, between Google and Apple, huh?  And I think Google is putting out a map app that you can get on the App Store. 
[00:27:00]  I've heard they already submitted it.  Yeah.  But Apple doesn't have to accept it.  Well, if they don't, then they're really stupid.  I bet they will.  They can say that it competes with something that they already have.  Well, they also blew off the YouTube, too, right?  That used to come with the phones?  Yeah.  No, I know, but they're making it a little harder is my point.  Yeah, most people know the workaround, but still.  It used to just be there when you bought your phone.  Yep.  I know.  It's me against you guys, man.  Terrible.  I represent Google, and you motherfuckers represent Apple. 
[00:27:30]  The Google.  Let's see what happens.  I enjoy the Google.  Let's see what happens.  I got Google Maps still.  Yeah.  Google's my enemy.  So, Sam went down to the iPhone 5 line.  Oh.  I had to find out what's the house.  At the big store?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I went to the big store on Fifth Avenue.  The big, you know, glass cubie store.  Yes.  Did they cover up the big glass cubie?  Not yesterday, but I think overnight they do.  Big unveiling that they do, and then all the employees go, 
[00:28:00]  Are you ready?  Come on, everybody.  It's like a cult.  You know what?  I hate that part.  You hate it?  Yeah.  I kind of like the energy around the whole thing.  Really?  They walk in, and it's like, woo!  They're patting everyone on the back.  It's just kind of a weird thing.  They're all clapping.  It's kind of strange.  It's like, hey, it's a phone.  It's a bit faster.  Imagine years ago, you go into, like, Sears to buy that old cordless phone,  and the employee's like, woo!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah, the phone!  It is a stupid phone.  You're right.  You're like, okay. 
[00:28:30]  It's a culture.  So, what?  You interviewed some people on the line there, Sam?  Yes, I did.  The first track is...  Oh, Greg Packer.  Jesus Christ, this guy.  The audio itself leaves something to be desired,  but there's no way we could do a segment on the line without Mr. Greg Packer.  I have known Greg Packer.  Greg Packer.  Let me think.  At least...  How long have you been doing radio?  18 years?  18.  I think I've known him for about the same time.  Jesus.  And Greg Packer... 
[00:29:00]  And this is what drives me nuts about Greg Packer.  He is the guy that gets online first for everything.  Yeah, he's the first online guy.  And he's also the guy that, like, I think shared a cheeseburger with President Clinton.  Like, he just knows how to get into these events.  How does he get in there?  Yeah.  And you see him on TV all the time, over and over again.  And the media, I guess they just play along because they make believe they've never seen  this guy before.  That's, I guess, what drives me nuts about this whole Greg Packer story.  And they know him.  Of course they know him.  Because they're like us. 
[00:29:30]  We're uber aware because this is what we do for a living.  Yeah.  So if you're a local TV station and you're sending out your reporters time and time again  for these events, after a while you're like, oh, it's that guy again.  Same faces.  But then they play along and make believe they're seeing him for the first time.  Yeah.  It would be like seeing Stalker Patty at a gig.  You know, you look down and go, ah.  Ah, yeah, there's Patty.  I know that.  But I guess he wasn't first.  No, he was like 15th this time.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's falling off.  But I told Anthony, you watch, though.  He knows how to get on TV.  He'll still be on TV for the iPhone 5. 
[00:30:00]  He missed the number one spot because he was celebrating Rosh Hashanah.  Oh, boy.  Well, that was dumb on his part.  Very stupid.  Because this is what he's known for.  What's more important, really?  People don't even know he's Jewish.  Eternal damnation or, you know, an iPhone.  Exactly.  You could at least call someone from Hades.  So the audio's bad, but we've got to play it because it's Greg Packer.  How could you do a segment without Greg Packer?  All right, fair enough.  Boy.  You were here last time, a year ago.  What do you need a new iPhone for?  Well, you've got to move up. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, I already got an iPhone 4 with Verizon, so I'm considering moving up to iPhone 5.  So while you're waiting here for, you got here on Tuesday?  Tuesday, yeah, Tuesday morning.  So while you're waiting here for four days for the iPhone, what you're considering is whether or not you're going to get the iPhone.  That's true.  It's actually three days.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, because Friday morning, iPhones go on sale.  That's easy.  There you go.  He's considering getting the iPhone while he's sitting there. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah, he's not even committing yet.  He just knows he has to be on the line because that's what he does for a living.  So he might not even get it?  He doesn't know what it is.  Oh, God.  So what does he get for doing this time and time again?  Well, he gets like now they're sponsoring everybody.  So he wears a T-shirt with some stupid logo on it.  But they just pay for iPhones.  Like they're suckering all these people because these people are walking billboards for five days.  Right.  And at the end of the day, they get a $300 phone for it.  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:31:30]  High fives!  It's the worst hourly wage ever.  Yeah.  It's not good.  Yeah.  A lot of these companies, little everything, mom and pop stores and stuff, they have people  wear their T-shirts.  Yeah.  And they sit online because they know the media is going to be there.  All right.  Did he say hi to us?  Of course he did.  He wanted to know how.  How's Opie doing?  Opie's doing good.  How's Anthony doing?  Oh.  Anthony is also doing good.  All right.  You tell him.  I say, hey, you got my number?  You guys want to call me?  No, we don't want to call you.  No, Greg Packer.  We have had him on.  We've had him on.  Yeah, he remembers. 
[00:32:00]  And I think he gives you a laundry list of all the things he was first at.  Right.  But he's a filthy liar, too, because I went back yesterday.  Not when I recorded that audio, but later.  He had a sign that said, my boss is making me wait online for this phone or something.  Please donate.  And then he told me he was retired.  All right.  He's retired.  Good for him.  Filthy liar.  He's just a filthy liar.  He's trying to steal money from you.  I think he worked for Lilco or one of those.  Really?  Yeah, he has a little solid blue-collar job on Long Island. 
[00:32:30]  Got a pension.  He did the right thing.  He worked hard.  We meet Joseph, the typical iPhone line guy.  Yeah, I put Joseph on because he's just like, everybody on that line sounds like Joseph.  Like, they just list, why are you getting an iPhone?  And they just list the things that Apple has just kind of said.  Right, right.  He's following the company line.  And they just talk about how amazing it is and how much more amazing it is than anything else.  And it's like, there's no actual thought. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Here's Joseph.  We're here in the iPhone 5 line with Joseph.  Joseph, what's the haps?  We've been here since last Friday.  And it's been amazing so far, the experience.  Yeah, we have one more day to go.  What about the experience is so amazing?  You guys have been living on the street in New York.  No, like, I don't know.  I like meeting all these new people that ask us, oh, what have you been here for?  What's the deal?  Why are you waiting for the iPhone?  I just, I don't know.  I feel like a celebrity.  It feels cool.  Because I got to tell you, I mean, some of you guys here, not you so much, but there  are some people here. 
[00:33:30]  Wait, can I stop?  I'm sure you picked up on it yourself, but he said he feels like a what?  Celebrity.  A celebrity?  Yeah, he's online.  Why?  Because a lot of media, I guess, is talking to him?  I mean, Sam Roberts is going and interviewing him.  Yeah.  I wouldn't just talk to anybody.  Celebrity, right there.  Did you have a mic flag?  And did you say, I'm from the Opie and Anthony show?  I had no mic flag, but I had Roland with a camcorder.  I feel like a celebrity.  I feel like a celebrity.  You know, well, he must have known that you interviewed the singer from Loverboy. 
[00:34:00]  Loverboy.  Thank you.  Yes.  And he saw me with Greg Packer, so he's like, okay, this guy's the real deal.  He's got to be interviewing celebrities.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Look at all the fucking people.  And now we're seeing the iPhone 5 people.  They used to line them up around the building.  Now they're doing that thing like at the fucking amusement park, so they've got to go in  and out and up and down the...  And then it'll extend out of that and around the building.  And around the building.  Yeah.  Because it's not cool to pre-order.  No, it's not cool to pre-order.  Look at all the free advertising they get today, too.  It really is amazing. 
[00:34:30]  It's unbelievable.  You can't put a number on that.  Cool.  Because I've got to tell you, I mean, some of you guys here, not you so much, but there  are some people here that look very homeless-y.  And they also get the experience of living on the street in New York through the homeless,  but they're all miserable.  I'm not miserable.  I'm happy because one more day, iPhone 5 is here.  I mean, it does feel like we're homeless because I actually have a sleeping bag sleeping on the  floor for the past week.  But generally speaking, homeless don't get iPhones when they're finished being homeless. 
[00:35:00]  Exactly.  So what is it about the iPhone 5 that's got you so excited?  Well, you know, it has upgrades from, I don't know how to explain it.  It's just a big upgrade.  As opposed to the iPhone 4, to the iPhone 4S, I like the hardware, the software, the cameras.  It's taller.  He doesn't even know what he's fucking putting.  It's taller?  It is.  He's got a point.  He's online buying something that he, yeah, he has no clue really why he even wants it. 
[00:35:30]  Every person who's like at the beginning of that line who's waiting for days would have  gotten on that line regardless of what Apple announced.  They could be, like Jimmy Kimmel's thing, they could be putting out the exact same phone  and they'd be online waiting for a phone.  Buying it again.  Oh my God.  For eight days.  That's unbelievable.  That guy, you could hear it in his voice.  I don't know how to explain it.  Yeah, because you have nothing to explain.  It's like I come to him and say, what do you like about the new phone?  I didn't know he was going to ask the tough questions.  Oh boy, I was just going to say it's great to be here. 
[00:36:00]  I'm like a celebrity.  Yeah, I wasn't ready for that question.  I feel like I'm part of something.  Had three days to think about it, idiot.  Oh, what I'm here to actually buy?  Hum-na-hum-na.  You're being very competitive.  Yeah, well, hi.  Who's another Joseph or the same Joseph?  Oh boy.  Same clown.  Is this the first Apple line that you've waited on?  Not at all.  I've been here doing this since 2007.  That's a long wait.  The first iPhone that came out really amazed me, so I'll never go back. 
[00:36:30]  Apple's the best of me.  Why do you wait online every single time, though?  Like I said, the experience, I think pre-ordering it is just too boring.  Do you feel at all like there's a void in your soul that you're filling with consumerism?  No.  What is that desire, then, that leaves you wanting that iPhone so bad?  You know, like, the iPhone is just a trademark.  It's very unique.  Like, there's nothing like it.  I mean, iPhone.  Like, I don't think you'll see anybody waiting online for any other phone besides this one.  That says something about the iPhone and about the iPhone customers. 
[00:37:00]  Exactly.  That's a lot.  God, you had to help him with his answers.  You got him there.  He goes, exactly.  You're like, I didn't mean that in a good way.  Nailed him again.  Another one.  I didn't quite mean that as a compliment there, Joe.  Well, no one has stores like that.  No.  No.  I mean, Samsung obviously sells a shitload of phones, but they don't have a Samsung store, really.  And they're also, like, they're not so concentrated.  Like, there's a Microsoft store.  I can't remember what mall I was in, but there was a Microsoft store.  But they got computers and Xboxes and, you know, Zunes and God knows what in there. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  And you could get them elsewhere, so you don't have to go to one location to get online.  This is very culty.  But the best part of that was the fact that, yeah, and that's why I'm not rushing out to buy this version.  I kind of, I liked the 4S.  That had a lot of updates above the 4 and, you know, from the 3 to 4.  All those new incarnations were kind of amazing.  But this one, a little taller. 
[00:38:00]  Wait, so you're not really getting it right away?  No, I'll get it when I can.  Right.  But I'm not freaking out that I got to get to the Apple store and buy this fucking thing.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll probably try to get one today, but I don't have the 4S.  4 to 5 is a big leap.  Yeah, yeah.  The 4S to 5 is not.  And then I downloaded the software, and I'm just not kind of amazed.  I mean, oh, cool.  I could, you know, do some certain little things with the alarms.  I know.  We'll try the Samsung. 
[00:38:30]  That fucking Samsung is pretty cool.  Galaxy S3.  I was going to say, I just hate the idea of learning an entirely new thing.  It's really.  It's like, oh, but all those little nuances are what you got to figure out.  We got an iPhone in the family, and so I use both.  It's like saying, I have a black friend.  You know, it's really not much different.  Plus, like Joseph said.  I mean, there's not a huge learning curve, I should say.  No, no.  But it's those little nuances that make the phone so handy, and those are the things that 
[00:39:00]  take a while to figure out, where someone tells you something, and you're like, really?  I could?  Oh, fucking cool.  Yeah.  How good can it be, though, if people will not wait online for it?  Well, you know, you got a point there, Mr. Roberts.  Joseph.  He spelled it out for us.  Yeah.  They're idiots.  Oh.  They should put him on a commercial explaining what the iPhone 5 does.  Yeah.  And they could be like, even if you're a moron, you can have fun with it.  Exactly.  Speaking of lines, I got one of those sneaker stores in my neighborhood.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Where they wait out.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  It seems like every weekend there's a new shoe.  You can put out Jordans.  That's what they're doing.  Yeah, and people stand on line.  Those lines aren't as long, but, I mean, I would say almost every other weekend, it  feels like.  You know, I'll go up 72nd Street there, and there's a few shoe shops, but there's one  of those hip, fucking hip-hop-type stores, and they're waiting out there in their beach  chairs.  They're all limited edition now.  There's like 20 or 30 guys just waiting for the store to open there.  Yeah, limited edition, collectibles.  But I thought that was like once in a while, but now it seems like it's... 
[00:40:00]  No.  They're the new Beanie Babies.  It's pretty frequent.  That's what the fucking Jordans are.  And what do you do with those?  You kill people for them.  But you don't wear them, obviously, if they're that special.  No.  So what do you do?  You put them online?  Do you just display them?  Some people sell them.  Some people sell them, yeah.  Some people just hold on to them and collect them, and some people like wait until one  special occasion where they can break them out.  One special occasion.  But yeah, Nike realized...  Once they get scuffed, you're done.  Nike realized how big the sneakerhead population was getting.  So they were just like, well, I'll just rape all of you. 
[00:40:30]  Keep pumping them out.  Really?  Yeah.  Man.  I had never understood that world.  Patrice used to amaze me when he used to talk about how he would wear sneakers once.  I can't even fathom that.  I've bought sneakers.  I grew up where we had to wear them and told you, you literally, your socks started getting  wet.  I just don't think about it.  Yeah.  Because the hole was all the way through, and then it was like, okay, I guess we got  to buy a new pair.  Yeah.  And Patrice would come in here with a pair of sneakers and go, yeah, I'm only wearing  these today.  You'll never see them again.  When the rubber fucking front sole of it is going flap, flap, flap, you got to tape 
[00:41:00]  it.  I used to peel that shit off.  It felt like I was peeling a scab.  It was nice.  I like that.  Yeah.  I don't understand that culture is what I'm saying.  I've got a lot of shoes I've never worn.  Well, why can't you wear these sneakers, let's say, 10 times?  Because the whole point is that they look fresh.  But don't they look fresh for real after 10 fucking...  No, because you start getting wrinkles in the leather and the scuffs.  That's crazy.  Once you can't return it to a store anymore, you know how if you wear it once, they can 
[00:41:30]  see the dirt on the bottom of the shoe, they're not going to take it back?  Fair enough.  Not fresh anymore.  How about two times you wear it?  These guys will not wear it past one fucking time.  You've got to pick a nice special day.  What if you waste it?  The word is crispy.  And once it starts to soften, it's no longer crisp.  After two wears?  Yeah.  After two wears.  It's like you get a new shirt, you put it in the wash once, and there is a difference from  when you first picked it up.  Do some of these guys change their sneakers halfway through the day? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, you'll only wear...  If it's a special pair of sneakers, you're not going to wear them the whole day.  I don't get that.  You can never understand that.  For the event.  They'll be your after work sneakers.  I don't like having shitty sneakers anymore, but, you know.  Yeah, yeah, not like completely shitty, but I'll wear the shit out of a pair of sneakers.  Right.  I only feel comfortable in my Chuck Taylors, but...  Oh, cool guy.  How many sneakers you got?  I've got a closet full of Nikes that I just...  Closet.  I mean, I can't...  I don't feel comfortable wearing them. 
[00:42:30]  Because they're nice.  Oh, boy.  See?  He's from that culture.  I don't know.  So what are you going to do with them?  It's in the jeans.  I don't know.  I've tried to not buy them as much because it's ridiculous.  They're a hoarder.  That's stupid.  But they're nice.  And then I cleaned out my closet a couple weeks ago.  So if they're nice, just wear them.  And I looked at them.  I opened the box.  I was like, holy shit.  I got some fresh gear.  That he doesn't wear.  Just wear them.  I won't be afraid.  Then I won't have any more fresh gear.  This is, and enough time goes by, you go back to that closet, and you're like, oh, fuck.  I can't wear these anymore. 
[00:43:00]  They're out of style or whatever.  But you can get new fresh gear.  That's expensive.  That's that money.  Oh, yeah.  Why won't you wear your sneakers that you buy?  Plus, I don't even feel comfortable wearing them.  Like, I feel comfortable in my converse.  Then why buy them?  That's what I'm trying to work through right now.  Oh, man.  You have some issues you're dealing with.  Ask me how many sneakers I got.  How many?  Two pairs.  What?  For real.  Like, I have more sneakers in my closet probably than just does.  I wear these weird, like, surfer sneaks.  Love these.  And then I got a worn out Merrill sneaker that they don't make anymore. 
[00:43:30]  And that's it.  That's it.  Plus, my feet point outwards, so no sneakers look cool on me ever.  Oh, they do.  How many pairs of sneakers do you have?  Two.  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  I got my 511s and some checks.  Yeah, but you guys aren't fresh.  Oh, we're fresher at.  I gotta be a little fresh.  You're not fresh.  I'm not fresh.  No, you're not.  I mean, you're cool, but you're not fresh.  Thank you.  I had a bad night of sleep, so first time in a long time I got sweats on today.  First time in a long time.  I hope Troy Kwan doesn't mind.  I'm sure he's already noticed.  This is literally the first time I've worn sweats. 
[00:44:00]  It could be almost a year at this point.  Jesus.  So I hope he doesn't mind.  Troy's gonna be like, ah, well, you reverted back.  No, he doesn't like that.  Oh, I saw, I was watching First 48 last night.  That's that show where black people kill other black people, and then other black people  get brought in to the police station, and they rat out the black people.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought snitches get stitches.  No, not, apparently not.  A lot of the snitches are blurred out and talking like this.  Well, he came up there, and I said, what the fuck? 
[00:44:30]  And there was a guy who walked into a convenience store, was robbing the place, he had a completely  covered, mask, everything.  And when the guy at the convenience store turned around, it was like a gas station, turned  around, he shot him, fucking shot him and killed him right there.  Boom.  It's on the surveillance camera.  Wow.  And then he jumps over the counter, grabs the money and packs cigarettes or whatever  the fuck, and then jumps out.  So the cops are looking at the surveillance tape, and right when he jumps out, they go,  oh, look at his sneakers, he's got some Jordans on. 
[00:45:00]  And then they go, let's go back and watch the whole day's tape and see if he came in  to case the joint.  And they're looking, looking, like, up, up, up, up, up.  And there's a guy with the same build as the guy with the fucking sneakers.  So they got, like, his description, and then they watch him in the store.  He picks up a fucking beer can and then puts it down.  They're like, get that beer can.  They got it, got the fingerprints, got it, and fucking nailed him.  That beer can was still there.  It was still there. 
[00:45:30]  Holy fuck.  And the motherfucker was still wearing the sneakers.  Because of his Jordans.  Because of his Jordans, they fucking nailed him.  Those guys are smart.  It was amazing, because then they follow him around the store on the camera, and he did.  He picked up a fucking beer can and was like, ah, and put it down.  And they're like, get the prints off it.  They got him, and there was his picture.  This is why you change shoes.  You need to have robbing shoes.  You got robbing shoes.  Right.  And don't pick up the beer unless you're going to buy it.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  There are fingerprints everywhere. 
[00:46:00]  What a dummy.  What a fool.  That's great.  All right, listen.  We got more audio of the people waiting online for the iPhone 5.  Yeah.  That we're going to do after the break.  We're going to get into the Occupy Wall Street people.  Oh, good.  I thought Anthony would enjoy hearing from...  I kind of got the ringleader, the most outspoken of the Occupy Wall Street guys to talk.  I can't wait.  Maybe he'll change my mind.  I think so.  Maybe.  I think so.  And we got a busy day.  We got JBL coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  He's climbing mountains. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, okay.  That's cool enough.  Yeah.  I like JBL, actually.  He's the man.  Is he back with the WWE?  Temporarily, but he's leaving for Africa today to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Is he trying to climb all seven?  Is it seven peaks they all try to do or something?  He's doing the seven highest peaks on each of the seven continents.  Does that include Everest?  Yes, he's doing that in 2014.  Over the next, like, two years.  2014.  He's got his little schedule.  That's what happens in December when the world ends.  That's why he did it.  He's never going to do it.  He's like...  Oh, fucking A. 
[00:47:00]  I just do Kilimanjaro.  Oh, I am too.  2014.  I'm going to do it.  I would love to climb a mountain.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not Everest.  We'll see if you can do Kilimanjaro.  Maybe JBL will take you along.  Yeah, let's do that.  Kilimanjaro.  We'll broadcast from the top.  And we've got everyone coming in today.  We've got Joe DeRosa, David Tell, and Bill Burr.  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  So it's going to be a good day, man.  Yeah, it should be fun.  And Greg Packer.  No, no Greg Packer.  No, no, no, no, no.

[00:50:30]  Series XM  The O.P.R.3 Show  We were just talking about Cavemen  Yes, Cavemen  Cavemen 
[00:51:00]  Because Sam, I think, asked how much longer for the second kid  And it's a mere week away at this point  A week to maybe, maybe ten days  Wow, that's it?  That's it  And then a stranger lives in your house forever  Yeah, and then  Shit  I think I said it when my son was born  It's the strangest thing when you're in the delivery room  And this thing pops out  You're like, who the fuck are you?  Where did you come from?  It's so bizarre  To wrap your head around it  And then you instantly fall in love with the damn thing  But at first you're like  What? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah  A little person who I don't know who they are  Right  Just came out of my wife  With full personality, by the way  Yeah  Even though they're just a tiny little thing  And you're sitting there like  Are you an alien?  Like, this doesn't make sense  An alien  Because I guess  My whole life  I just assume when you finally become a father  You feel like  Oh, there's a mini me  Yeah, yeah  You know  Just a small O.P.  Right  So you can kind of relate to that  Because you know who you are  Of course  But then you realize quickly  No, these things that are born  Have their own shit right away 
[00:52:00]  So when he was born  And you said he had a personality right off the bat  Was the personality kind of the same personality as now?  He had that when he was born?  No, of course not  It's just more of on a deep level  You realize he's his own person  Right  But then we were talking about  How weird it had to be  When like the cavemen were around  And you know  We've talked over the years  How these idiots  Couldn't figure out the wheel  For many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many  They were stupid 
[00:52:30]  They were just stupid  They had these round things laying around  And they couldn't figure out  That they would  A, roll down a hill  And B, wait  We can maybe use this  To make our lives better  And then they couldn't figure out fire  So I'm telling Anne  I'm like  Can you imagine  You're sitting around  As a caveman  You don't understand  That you're getting your  Well, it wouldn't be a wife at the time  Whatever it is  Your chick  You know, pregnant  Yeah  You were just doing that sex thing  Because it felt good  And next thing you know  You're sitting around  Finally the fire  That you finally figured out 
[00:53:00]  And your woman's just getting bigger  And bigger and bigger  And the next thing you know  Something pops out of her  That must have freaked them out  They're like  Oh, what's the matter?  Oh, that fat belly of hers  Is now it's making her hurt  Oh, boy, this is bad  Right  And then a baby shoots out  You're like  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Because I would love to know  When they figured out  That actually the sperm  And the egg made something  Yeah  They didn't know?  They couldn't possibly know  Right  And I'm sure they thought  It was some kind of witchcraft  At first  I'm sure half the pregnant women 
[00:53:30]  Were probably thrown in a pit  Oh, killed  Because they didn't understand it  The baby that came out  Has to be burned  Right  You know, yeah, you got to  And then some  I'm the devil  Idiot with a tiny bit of intelligence  Said, wait a minute  This is happening a lot  Maybe this is just part of the life thing  Oh  Oh, really?  Well, all right  We can give that a shot, I guess  Oh, okay  Stop killing the women with the big bellies  And the things that come out of them  Right  Stop doing that  Because, I mean, we think of the wheel in the fire  But, fuck, that's even crazier 
[00:54:00]  So human beings were almost extinct for a minute  Yeah, because they didn't understand it  Because they didn't get it  They were going to kill off all the babies  Right  Aliens are popping out of our women  And I think they're here to destroy us  So I think we got to get rid of  We have to stop  Yeah  We have to get rid of any woman  That gains a few pounds  And, you know, oh my god  If it gets to the point where an alien pops out  Yeah, we got to get rid of that, too  People just inherently silly and violent  That's just what they are  I don't understand  Kill  Kill, kill  We invented the wheel and fire  So they light the wheel on fire 
[00:54:30]  And roll it into someone else's cave  Right  That's pretty much the first weapon  Yeah  We were doomed from that day on  Just hanging on by our fingernails here on this planet  Did you see the astronomy pictures that I tweeted yesterday?  Oh, yeah  Holy fuck  I'm not a big astronomy guy  Because it just creeps me the fuck out  But these pictures were just  That's pretty goddamn cool  How do you take pictures of that shit?  Amazing, right?  That's some faraway shit  But who has access to telescopes like that  Where they could get some good photography done? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, it's not like you could just  Like, why?  Hey, let me put my iPhone up to that lens  And snap a nice picture  Like, what is that?  We're looking at  It's like a galaxy  That's just a whole galaxy?  It's a whole fucking galaxy  So is that galaxy like the  That's a dot that's really close?  How does that work?  It's like the Milky Way galaxy  But far away  Wow, it's like two galaxies are together  There's something on the end of that one  That's fucking cool as shit  Isn't it an amazing picture?  Do you know how big that is?  How wide across that fucker is? 
[00:55:30]  Right  The whole thing you see  Just a bunch of stars in there  And planets around those  There's so much life out there  And there's so many of those fucking things  Can't we all just go  Look, there's so much life out there  Let's stop  We haven't proven it  But look  Look at the odds  Obviously there's  Right this second  Well, I mean  Somewhere far away  Some other life form's doing something fucked up  Right now  It just has to be  Absolutely  It has to be  Right now  A radio show, maybe 
[00:56:00]  Maybe  Yeah  If there is this God thing  You think you just picked one granular of sand?  Because what do they say?  There's more galaxies or stars than sand or something?  Oh yeah  So you go to the beach, right?  And you see all this sand for miles and miles  And you're trying to tell me that only one  Pick up one granular  That's the only place life is?  Get the fuck out of here  And it's every grain of sand on like every beach  It's every beach, right?  Yeah  And you're trying to tell me  Yeah  That one granular of sand has life 
[00:56:30]  That's so stupid  Unless there's  But God  All right  One God per universe  So each granular of sand has a God  Some of them made life  Some of them did not  So obvious that there's always been life  Of course  And then the planets fuck up  Or the fucking sun  Their sun burns out  Something happens  And then that fucking area is done  Unless they figured out their technology  Where they're able to hop, skip, and jump to somewhere else  So when our universe burns out 
[00:57:00]  It's just going to be another universe that burned out  That somebody somewhere far away goes  Unless we  Never existed  Unless we figure it out  Oh my God  And jump  Jump to another planet or something  The whole universe can't peter out  It's just what it is  It's there  It's space  Galaxies  That could  That's what I meant  Or solar systems  Or planet  Or your hometown  Do you think it's possible  That's what I did there  Not Westchester  Do you think it's possible that we've been planet jumping?  Could be  I mean you've got to think about time  Like in a way where you can't even wrap your head around it 
[00:57:30]  But is it possible that we've been just jumping planets?  Maybe  To get further away from the sun?  Maybe like initially the sun was a lot smaller  And Mercury was a viable planet for life  And life was there  And then the sun started getting bigger  And they're like  Whoa we've got to get out of here  So then they jump  Right  You know  And then you keep going  You end up on Venus  And then Earth  Right  And wouldn't that be Adam and Eve?  Adam and Eve are just two fucking astronauts  Yeah  Just astronauts 
[00:58:00]  Starting the  Starting all over again  The whole process on Earth  Yeah  Hey we were talking about cavemen  What religion is that by the way?  Is that Scientology?  Scientology loves space  Alright  Loves space  Yeah  Yeah cavemen  It's like  Wouldn't the religion argument come into play also with cavemen?  It's like  You're supposed to be married before you procreate  They didn't know anything about marriage  Right  But they were fucking and making kids  Right  So  What were they all sinners?  Of course  But that's the only way life would have 
[00:58:30]  Gotten a foothold on this planet  Well but God didn't give the rules yet  Oh is that it?  Yeah  Adam and Eve  But what about all those people?  Why would he give those guys the rules?  Yeah  He hadn't thought of them yet  The way we look at religion is just stupid  People were put on this Earth as just human beings  Totally  With all the knowledge and insight and everything  It wasn't evolved like cavemen figuring things out  And going oh I get it now  I think if God gave us all a pop quiz  We would all fail  Flunk 
[00:59:00]  Miserably  Flunk  He would laugh as he's grading our papers  Like you think this?  You didn't study  Right  They're dead  Not saying there isn't anything  But I think the way we look at it is completely ridiculous  And in the end will destroy our fucking Earth  Thank you  The religion thing just doesn't make any sense  It just doesn't make sense  In its current form  Yes  It's crazy to think that when you read those silly books  That it happened like that  Written by people so long ago 
[00:59:30]  That they didn't even have it straight as far as  You know the Earth being the center of the universe  Right  You know they get all that shit wrong  If those idiots knew so much  And you know the miracles and all that  Why didn't they have an iPhone 5?  Yeah exactly  So smart  Miracle me a fucking iPhone  Right  They could like  They could split the seas  Yeah  To walk across for food or whatever the hell  But they can't figure out how to communicate  Miracle useless without pics  That's what I say  That's what I fucking say  That's the thing about Scientology 
[01:00:00]  It's like just because it came out more recently  It's really not crazier than other religions  No crazier than any other fucking religion  You know we got a Mormon that's very close to being the president of the United States  And some would say that religion's a bit wacky  Yeah Mormonism  With the Joseph Smith and all  They're crazy  They're all wacky though  All the religions are wacky  You got the Muslims who just love killing people  Is that in the book?  It's their religion  Oh  Their whole thing  You know how Catholicism  It's all about the body of Christ  Right  And sinning  And repentance 
[01:00:30]  And things like that  Muslim religion  It's all just about blowing people up  And raking people with machine guns  Yeah  Horrible  We'll end up destroying the world  For over nonsense  Because we're just not  Eventually  We're just not educated enough  To fully understand the big picture  We've had so many instances  Where we came close  So at some point  Come on  We gotta fuck this up  Yeah we wait  Yeah  We will  But I take solace in the fact  That you see all those little dots  In this one picture we're looking at  Yeah  Oh there's life out there  Something there 
[01:01:00]  Fuck yeah  Something there  Maybe they're doing it right  Maybe  I bet not though  Anything that's a life form  There just seems to be too much room  For mistakes  And fucking up  It's not a perfect thing  Maybe that's why God  Like has so many galaxies  Because he knows  People are just gonna keep  Fuckin' up  He's hedging his bets  But you're not gonna fuck up  My entire universe  I'm hedging my bets  Give me another one of those pictures  For the astronomy competition  Goddamn cool  Like what is that  We're looking at  What almost looks like a heart 
[01:01:30]  It's a nebula  It's all red  It looks like a nebula  Veiny and globular  Atari nebula  Look out  You know what happens  When you fly in there  Your shields don't work anymore  Oh boy  And your sensors  That's not good  That's why  You gotta go on your z-axis  Go way down  And wait for the other ship  To pass you  Then you come up  And go fire  You know this is a waste  Because it's a visual  But put it on the  Facebook page  I thought this was  A pretty cool thing  That I came across yesterday  They had some kind of 
[01:02:00]  Astronomy competition  And these were the winners  Whoa that's pretty  Fuckin' cool  I just  I would love to talk  To one of these eggheads  Oh man  Like how do you photograph  Fuckin' space  Well first you must calibrate  The lens apertures  Oh okay  You know what my new thing is  I got some nice binoculars  Cause I live way up high  In the sky  And I look at the moon  Through them  Yeah  God damn  You can see some craters  You can see some shit  Isn't that fucked up  You can see some shit  Just using your binoculars  Craters  Holy fuck 
[01:02:30]  I didn't know that  It's pretty fuckin' cool  Then I'm thinking  Well maybe I'll get a telescope  So I can see even more shit  Yep  That's how that shit works  Sam went to the Apple store  Big day for the iPhone 5 people  And he interviewed these idiots  That's right  And we left off  With the Occupy Wall Street people  Oh great  So they were down there  What were they doing down there though?  That's against everything  They believe in  Well it was like a  Demonstration  Like it was the first 15 people  Were all people waiting for iPhones  And then as of yesterday 
[01:03:00]  The 15 people after them  Around the other corner of the block  All stinky stinky  Occupy Wall Street people  Oh  Hold on  Mike in Tennessee though  I want to find this in the Bible  Go ahead Mike  Yeah I wanted y'all something to think about  In the book of Genesis  When God created Adam and Eve  I like some of the songs  He told us to be fruitful  And multiply  And replenish the earth  Replenish the earth  Replenish  Replenish 
[01:03:30]  Yeah  Some would say that means  Okay look  You guys fucked it up  I'm going to give you another shot at this  What about that Adam Wedlock thing?  Well that came later  But I was just talking about  Stuff being there  Before Adam and Eve  And for them to say  Replenish  It had to be something there at first  And I'm glad you said Adam and Eve  And not Adam and Steve  Because that's not the way  Oh god  That one  People that say it  Like they just heard it  I think  It's like it's their idea  Yeah  I'm doing this for entertainment purposes 
[01:04:00]  Because I really don't want to piss off  The religious nuts out there  But if you really break it down  You got Adam and Eve right  Supposedly that was it  Yeah  So then  Adam and Eve  Have a  Was it a son?  I forget  They begot  Begot  Begot  Two sons  Two sons  Okay so then you got the two sons  Cain and Abel of course  Cain and Abel  So then you got the two sons  That means they had to  Have sex with their mom  Yeah what happens there?  And then they have sex with their mom  Then let's say there's now a girl  So then the girl is now having sex with Adam 
[01:04:30]  That's some  That's a fucked up family  One brother killed the other brother  Yeah  What a great fucking  That started out like shit  It was a big incest fight  Yeah an incest fight  Were they fighting over the mom?  I believe so yeah  That's sick  Incest fights are the worst  Why would a religion be based on  That's crazy  Having sex with your siblings  With your mom  Your mom and your father  With each other  And a snake and an apple  Really weird  You kill the fucking brother  It's violence right off the bat  Yeah 
[01:05:00]  Why was it an incest  Back then?  You gotta fuck someone  Yeah  You really do  Right?  That's my motto  Yeah  Let's get back to the line  Thank you there Mike  Replenish the earth  Talking to the Occupy Wall Street people  On the iPhone 5 line  Yeah this was like  We're on the iPhone 5 line  With Ryan from Occupy Wall Street  Occupy DC as well  As well?  Yeah  I'm affiliated with both groups  He's multitasking? 
[01:05:30]  Yes  Affiliated  Yes of course  Occupy DC  Well  Occupy everywhere  I didn't know the occupiers  Like the iPhones  I mean  There are  We do  You know  There are some people  That do use them  You know  That are donated  And stuff  That use them for live stream  And you guys are gonna be the first  To get the iPhone 5  Oh no we're not  None of us in this line  Are getting ready  To buy the iPhone 5  Good  You're in the  You're in a terrible location then 
[01:06:00]  Because this is specifically for people  Actually we're in the perfect location  Because right now on Craigslist  Along with other places  They are selling spots in line  So we're waiting to get the ticket parts in line  And we're going to sell off the spots online  So that we can take the money  And donate it to things that Apple doesn't like  Why would you donate to things Apple doesn't like?  Because we don't like Apple  Why?  Because they have child  Not child slave labor  Just general slave labor  Over in  You know  Over in  China  China 
[01:06:30]  China  Right here  This is $100  Yen  I'm not  I'm sick of that  I got taking that as well  Yeah  Us looking in  Wow  Child slave labor  To them  It's a job  It's a job  They don't know any better  Take their job away  Right  This motherfucker's trying to take these people's jobs away  What are they gonna do?  Right  We're the do-gooders for the world  But  Oh man  For those people that are in those horrible conditions  To them  It's just work  He uses child slave labor  And like  Man  What the fuck 
[01:07:00]  If he had it his way  There wouldn't be any of that  And these people would be starving in a rice paddy somewhere  There you go  Dummy  Don't take their jobs away  That's all they got  I need my job  They probably feel good about themselves  Yeah  Accomplishing things  They're accomplishing things  Working toward goals  Right  We're the idiots that look in  Making all of that cash  Yeah  A little cash  Very little  But some still  But it's cash  It's not no cash  They had to get together with each other  And plan this  What do you want to do? 
[01:07:30]  Apple's here  Yeah we should be down there man  Representing  Representing what?  Give it to cause that Apple doesn't like  Oh that's gonna really upset  Multi-billion fucking dollar Apple  Steve Jobs is rolling over his grave  Oh must hate it  They're gonna give fucking ten bucks to a soup kitchen  From a line that they stood on for fucking ten hours  Wow  I know we've moved on  But Steve Meitzer  Or Meitzler  Or something like that  From PA  The book of Genesis  Was the original aristocrats 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  That's a good line  Ta-da  Amen  Well  I think it was a little weird  In the beginning  It was  That Old Testament's a little  A little weird  A little weird  Didn't really believe in the clothes at first  And then when they did get the clothes  There was not much going on there  Not leaving too much to the imagination  Did this guy  Oh yeah  Smell poorly?  He smelled very very bad  Yeah  God  Yen  I'm not sure the exact currency it's called  That's a lot of money  Uh yeah 
[01:08:30]  Well you would think  This is fifteen dollars an American  You know how much they averagely get paid an hour in this?  Two  Averagely?  Yeah  So this is fifteen dollars American  And two dollars yen  You do the math  That's not even like  A hundredth of a tenth of a cent  So what is he trying to say?  I don't know  That they're not making a lot of money over there  Yeah but they also don't have as much worry  And they don't have to spend as much of that money  It's all relative  They don't have to worry about a horrible commute  And paying a mortgage 
[01:09:00]  And all that shit  A fucking can of Campbell's soup  Doesn't cost fucking you know  A buck over there  Right  It's like a penny  Yeah  In which case you know  Two dollars an hour  As they say  Righteous bucks  Righteous bucks  Righteous bucks  Uh  Occupy guy hates Apple  But he's online  He hates Apple though  He's showing them  These people live  In buildings  Oh ah  That aren't regulated  They live in these things  Because we feel they need to be regulated 
[01:09:30]  I hate this  This self important idiot  Who thinks he knows what's best for people  That he has no idea what their culture is about  No  No idea what their thought process is  What they like or don't like  He really doesn't have any idea  I'm saying I don't have any idea either  Why do we  But I would assume  They know more than I would  About how they want to live their lives  Why do we need everyone to live like us?  Yeah  I mean they probably don't value the opinion of somebody  Who's standing out on the street  With camo shorts and socks on  Right  I dress like that  Maybe 
[01:10:00]  You wear shoes though  By my pool  Maybe in a strange way  Not having all that stress and pressure  Is a good thing  It's wonderful right?  You have to deal with a sweatshop  Okay  But then you leave  You go to work every day  That's what you do  Right  And technically  Not even technically  They are a communist nation  They're communist capitalists  But you know  For the most part  They can work  Make shit money  But you know  The government will take care of them  There were some people  That didn't like the way they were led  You know what they did? 
[01:10:30]  Founded America  Right  America  They got off their ass  And they founded the greatest country in the world  Right  It's like the history channel  And then they worked their asses to the bone  In America  Yeah  Never enjoying the fruits of America  It was terrible around here for a long time  Awful  They aren't regulated  They live in these things  Where they are in bunk beds  Stacked on four on top of each other  They live on one floor  With two hundred people  Typically sharing one bathroom  Living in horrible conditions 
[01:11:00]  Well if you could do that  If you're a tiny little thing  He's saying they stay at the Carter  Yeah  They're in Times Square  People loved that break yesterday  Oh it was great  I heard some stories about the Carter yesterday  What?  Cop friend of mine  Oh boy  He says they constantly are getting calls from people  Reporting items being stolen out of their rooms  He said like there was once  You know like the Russian kids that are always on YouTube 
[01:11:30]  Climbing up building structures and stuff  He said one time they were a couple blocks away  And it looked like the letters  Like the neon letters were blinking out or something  And then they realized  There's a couple of kids climbing up the sea in Carter  They were going to make Turk 182 out of it I think  Is that what happened?  Old movie  But yeah he said constantly  People are getting their shit stolen  Yeah  Doesn't sound like a good place  No  We didn't talk to that lady that made that documentary film on Monday 
[01:12:00]  Oh cool  Very cool  We could have talked to her today  But I figured Jimmy would  Yeah Jimmy won  Talk to her for sure  Here back to the Occupy Wall Street guy  Living in horrible conditions  They have nets outside of the buildings  Where they catch people because they're committing suicide  And trying to at such an alarming rate  That to keep their work population going  They have to put nets outside of them  So they don't die  This is such bullshit  It's true  Come on dude  Oh is he great 
[01:12:30]  This guy is a dumb fuck  They have circus nets surrounding the building  Yes  Yes  Show me one picture of that  Well I don't have a photo  But show me one picture of that  Show me the Chinese suicide nets  I want to see the Chinese suicide nets  It's just full of Chinese people that are alive  But can't get down off the net  Oh god  They probably just want some air  And they want to make it easy  Right  So you get some air  And they lift the net back up  They climb back in the window  And get back in position  It's a game  Yeah 
[01:13:00]  Wow  There's 250,000 millionaires in Hong Kong  Nice  Oh  You know something  I want to say something about Hong Kong  Yeah  King Kong  Went to Hong Kong  Right  To play ping pong  With his ding dong  That is hilarious  It is fucking amazing  Yeah  Outside of them  So they don't die  And thank god for that  Yeah  Thank god for something I guess  Apple must be happy though  That you guys are doing all your interviews  With the big Apple logo behind you  I mean you know 
[01:13:30]  You gotta keep them going  What  Maybe they'll throw some sponsorship our way  And then  You know  We can go off  Buy iPhones  Burn them  How much are you  But don't burn them  I mean  Obviously not  Because then that'll just mean  That the workers have to go off  And do more  Plus they're so handy  They do so many different things  You can tweet  You can Facebook  Tweeting and Facebook  What did people do  Before that whole  Tweeting and Facebook  You tell me  Text  I think they texted me  And did here  And said hello  Hello indeed 
[01:14:00]  Oh my gosh  They said hello  Yeah but when people were saying hello  It was such a bore fest  That's why we went to our phones  That's like being like  Cars are bad  Remember when people used to ride horses  Yeah  We used to ride for a long time  You'd be able to talk to somebody  On the horseback for a week  While you were going to the next town  Yeah  Shut it  And that hello is very overrated  Yeah it means nothing  You realize people have nothing to say  This fucking guy  Is so infuriated  He is  You've got one of the definitive  Guys from Occupy 
[01:14:30]  I love their selective facts  Yes  They're like a couple of people  Like have committed suicide over there  Right  But he doesn't mention  And I'm not saying  That it's a great place to work  I know like the conditions  Are deplorable and everything  But he fails to mention  That there's a giant wait list  To work there  Right  Because it is one of the best  Paying jobs  Yeah  In that part of China  And I'm sure the conditions  Are probably pretty good  I mean they're alright  To work there  As far as your sweatshops  But if you don't know any better  Who cares  Yeah 
[01:15:00]  You know how many people  Have killed themselves  Jumping off the library in NYU  Yeah  Oh NYU  Forget about it  It's deplorable  You gotta have a little  You have to have an  Asian person umbrella  When you walk by there  The parents get very upset  If they get a B  Oh boy  This guy  He said he was homeless  It has to be  America's the only place  Where homeless people  Can be kind of chunky  Yeah  But he doesn't look hungry  And he's selling his spot  He's selling his spot  He's got his Transformers  T-shirt on  So he's participating 
[01:15:30]  In capitalism  Yes  But he's saying that  Money goes toward the cause  Oh of course it does  Hashtag OWS  Doesn't Apple's money  Go towards their cause  Yeah  Something tells me  It's gonna go towards  A black tar cause  This motherfucker  Is such  A typical  Hatable  Wanna be part of something  Guy  With his  Inaccurate facts  And of course  He's got the guy  Who videos me  Interviewing him 
[01:16:00]  Just in case  I do an edit  So they can get  The real interview  Out there  Real story man  The whole world's watching  They're all too dumb  To know that you're  Making fun of him  I'm just there to  Goof on you buddy  There's nothing else  Don't worry about it  The nets are not  Outside the factories  They're on the inside  So it prevents people  From trying to  Leave their jobs  I have no idea  This guy says  They go to China  Three or four times a year  They're hard workers  They take a lot of vacations  For Lunar New Year's 
[01:16:30]  Oh  This guy doesn't even know  What Lunar New Year's is  No  The child's slave labor  Was disputed  In an article  It was a lie  You know  Some phone calls  Coming in right now  More from this guy  Or did you move on  To another  Occupy guy  No no no  This is the same guy  Okay  Does it make you  Does it make you guys  Feel bad that  Some of the iPhone  Waiters  Have been quoted as  Saying that you guys  Are kind of bummers  Not at all  Because  Because patience  Is a virtue 
[01:17:00]  You know  And I try to  You know  Be as patient as I can  With you know  People and things  But first out  There's not too much  Of a difference  Between the iPhone 4  And the iPhone 5  Well the iPhone 5  Is a third of an inch taller  Okay  But you do understand  Where they would think  That you're kind of  Bumming everybody out  Bumming people out  And the fact that  They're like  Oh wait  We do contribute  To terrible labor  Well they don't want  To think about  All this bullshit  They're waiting  Online for phones  You know 
[01:17:30]  Yeah exactly  They're waiting  For that phone  So that the  You know  Milliseconds  And you know  Seconds can add up  So you know  When they get down  Checking their Facebook  And their Twitter  They can have  All that extra time  For you know  Internet porn  That's right  And you know  That's five extra seconds  That they can beat off for  Is there anything  That you want to say  To the people  Before we say farewell  Um you know  Read your constitution  I carry my pocket  Constitution with me  Every day  And realize that  You have the freedom  Of speech  But only if you  Fight for it  En masse together  What an asshole 
[01:18:00]  Do you think he really  Cares about the  Working conditions  In China  No  Do you honestly think  This fucking dick bag  Gives a flying fuck  About the working conditions  And the people of China  You think he thought  About the working conditions  Of whatever company  Made his t-shirt  That he's wearing  His Transformers t-shirt  And  Pretty sure  It was not made here  And if this motherfucker  Isn't fucking tweeting  Or texting  And fucking looking  Of course he is  You lying sack of shit  He's a minute ago  He's like oh 
[01:18:30]  Remember before  We were tweeting  And Facebooking  That stuff's bad  Right before that  He goes yeah  We use our iPhones  For live stream  Yeah yeah  Live stream  All right we move on  To the next guy  Oh a woman  Rachel  Rachel is my favorite  Person I talked to  Oh good  So we end strong  With this  Is she Occupy  No  Oh no  That's Rachel  Oh god  Where is this video  For the people  It's on our Facebook  It's on our Facebook  Page  Hoping Anthony  On Facebook

[01:19:30]  It's not intrusive  You're transparent  I think the worst one  Was for  I think it was NASCAR  Where the car comes  Zooming in  Does a couple spins  I'm like I'm trying to  Watch the show  Yeah it's doing donuts  In the middle of your show  Like what are you doing  What the fuck are they doing here  I can't see my show  That's not going to turn me  On a NASCAR  It's going to make me  Really mad at NASCAR  Pisses me off  E-Rox  The new one NBC is doing  The new one NBC is doing now  For The Voice  You're watching the show  And then this light happens  And all of a sudden  All four chairs turn around  For the judges  And now they're taking up  The entire third  Of your screen  It's so intrusive 
[01:20:00]  What do you mean?  It's worse than the Fox NFL robot  On The Voice  When they pick  The person  Yeah their chairs turn around  Yeah no I know  They turn  But you're watching a sitcom  Or something  This light just shows up  And then these four  Light columns show up  And then it turns around  And now the judges  In their chair  It's like they beamed  Into your screen  Oh I got you  And then it fades up  The voice  You know with that  So the whole bottom third  Of your screen  You can't see  Because the voice is there  That is very good  Yes  Oregon you're right  TV's adopting 
[01:20:30]  The strategies  Of the internet pop-up ad  Yeah  They're fucking pop-ups  And you can't click off of them  You just gotta sit there  And watch it  Which I don't care  Until they start  Yapping at you and stuff  Yeah  They look like  Little ghost people  Little apparitions  What are they talking about?  I want to know  What they're saying  Because then they start  Looking at each other  And like  Yeah they're nodding  Looking  Oh that's funny  Pointing  A lot of pointing going on  Pointing at the screen  Hey  Yeah  You  You watch  You 
[01:21:00]  So this bitch  Who is she?  Rachel  Let's meet Rachel  On the iPhone 5 line  We're here on the iPhone 5 line  With Rachel  Rachel what's the haps?  Well  Everybody wants a new version  Of iPhone 5  So  We're waiting in line  Now  Some people decided  To do this silly thing  And order it on the internet  Why did you decide  To wait online?  I don't want to get ripped off  By the internet  So I decided  To just wait in line  Have you heard a lot of  Horror stories 
[01:21:30]  Of the internet  Going and ripping people off?  Scams and stuff like that  So  I'm just going to  Avoid the internet  I'm just waiting in line  Why's she getting the phone?  Wait wait wait  The whole  The whole aspect  That you have an iPhone  Right  Is you're putting your life  Online  Right  In some capacity  Of course  So she's paranoid  About order  When you go in there  And you get the phone  You give up so much information  That he then puts  Online somewhere  It goes into their server 
[01:22:00]  I wanted to hang out  With this woman  I was so perplexed  With what on earth  She was doing there  Right  She's good for like  A flip phone  Yeah  She needs the jitterbug  Way too  The jitterbug  She's all about  Metro PCS  She's like  Those two  Those two brothers  That bought the phone  From the  It's endorsed by  AARP  And he's like  I have a new cell phone  And he's at home  The other brother  On a regular cord phone  How could you afford that? 
[01:22:30]  And they talk about  And then they talk about  The features  It has buttons  For dialing  And that's about it  Yeah  I hate when we're wrong  On this show  So I'm gonna whisper this  Uh oh  What happened?  A lot of people  Sending us pictures  Of the suicide nets  Oh please  They're probably  Fucking circus nets  They're for birds  They seem to be  Yeah for birds  I bet they put  At one place  Look  The suicide fucking  Truth Diggins  I bet that isn't  With a Z 
[01:23:00]  I bet that's so  Yeah  They can't throw shit  Down onto the sidewalk  Oh probably  Cause they're so poor  They're like  Well fuck this  Let's throw some of these  iPhones out the window  Yeah  And sell them on the black market  You know what  And you're right  That's construction  You know what  We could send a picture  Of these construction things  That they build  At the base of the buildings  Here in Manhattan  And say that's to catch the people  It's true  That's so they don't  Throw shit out the windows  See how you could spin anything  In this world  Cause let me tell you something  Cause one iPhone  One fucking iPhone 
[01:23:30]  You get that out of the factory  And then you get it  On the black market  Your fucking family's gonna be  Rolling in it for a while  Also I bet I could miss that net  It's not going out very far  Nah  I could jump from the roof  And miss that net entirely  Well can't you use it  Like a trampoline  Or how about you aim  For one of the fucking poles  That are holding the net up  Right  Oh stop it  Let's go back to Rachel  Internet  I'm just waiting in line  You know  It is a smart thing  To avoid the internet  What do you use  Your smartphone for  Or what are you planning  On using it for 
[01:24:00]  Texting  Messages  To my friends  Oh friends  Well it's good to get  An iPhone then  What are the features  About the new iPhone  That have you so excited  I'm not sure  Because I haven't seen it yet  But I'm pretty sure  It would be like  Really cool to use  Every day  Like a laptop  Wait  What influenced you  To get on this line  Then  Like everybody else  That's waiting in line  We're just  Sheep  Like  Really wanting to buy 
[01:24:30]  Apple phone 5  And we want  We want our phones now  Oh my god  You found a winner  I swear  There's already  YouTube comments  Saying the blonde  Has to be a plant  Like she's  This is not a plant  I walked up  And as a matter of fact  She was sitting next  To Greg Packer  After I interviewed  Greg Packer  She goes  I'll do an interview  I was like  Okay whatever  And this  Is who this person is  Well what you should do  Is make a separate video  With just her  Just her  Yeah  It's astounding  Absolutely  Dummy on iPhone 5 line 
[01:25:00]  That would do very well  Out there  She has no idea  What the phone does  Many people  Have no clue  What this phone does  But they can't  Not be on that line  No  They have to be there  To buy it  Because they're told  They need it  And have to buy it  This is an amazing experiment  With that said  Rachel learns  What a camera is  Are you kidding me?  Oh boy  You're at a good point  Because you have no idea 
[01:25:30]  What the iPhone 5 offers  So it's like  While all these people  May be disappointed  Or know what to expect  It's all going to be  A surprise for you  Yeah  And I can't wait too  Because I heard  That it's only $200  Instead of $800  So I'm very enthused  I might buy  Two or three phones  So what happens  If you get into the store  And it costs more than $200?  That's right  Because I have my credit card  Perfect  Pay later 
[01:26:00]  Why not?  So we'll see what happens  What is it about the iPhone 5  That makes you want it so much?  I like the way it's designed  I like the Apple on it  It's white  It's like  Oh my god  You gotta make a separate video  I'm telling you  She likes the Apple on it  How amazing is she?  And it's white  It's white  Holy fuck  Does she have an old iPhone?  No  She said she doesn't have a phone  Oh so this is gonna be  Our first phone  Gotcha  I'm stunned 
[01:26:30]  On it  It's white  It's like silver colors  Glass  Frames  It's like really cool  It's touch screen  Everything is really really advanced  And cool about the iPhone 5  It has a camera I've heard  I guess so  I've never owned anything like that  Before in my life  So we'll see  It takes  It'll take still pictures  Of moving images  That's even better  Holy shit  I would think she's a plant  Yeah I know  I swear to God 
[01:27:00]  I mean literally a plant  That's a plant there  Like and there wasn't even any  There's no prep  For any of these people  That goes into these interviews  You just walk up  Say hey I'm doing some interviews  You wanna talk about the iPhone?  Yeah  Okay  And then boom  Mike's on and that's it  Wouldn't you think for a second  And think holy shit  I know nothing about it  I better not talk to this guy  And then think to yourself  Come to think of it  Why on earth am I sitting here?  Because I don't even know  What I'm buying  But this woman  She's not just  There was  Tornado 
[01:27:30]  An almost tornado  In New York  On Tuesday  Yeah  Night  She was online  While the tornado was on  So she's one of the early ones  Yes  Oh my god  She's there before Greg Packer  And she doesn't know why  What do you think this is about?  I don't have a clue  It's a great social experiment  If you pound it into people's heads  Long enough  That they need something  Yeah  They will just go there  On instinct  Without any knowledge  Of what they need  She doesn't know how much it costs  She just brought a credit card 
[01:28:00]  And said whatever it is  I don't know  Just please let me have it  Please let me buy this  You gotta think  There's mental illness  On the front of these lines  There has to be  Like this is based on  Something like  Fuck  That we can't even  Comprehend  There was one guy there  Who wasn't  He wasn't funny  So I didn't give you the clip  But  He waited  For the iPhone 4S  And this guy  Seemed like he had his shit together  Like he was actually  Like a  Person who could speak  Right  Hence  I didn't give you his clips  Ah  But  Before they introduced 
[01:28:30]  The iPhone 4S  When he just knew  There was an announcement coming  That he and his friends  Started camping out  In front of the iPhone store  And  They were there for  Eighteen days  What the fuck  What just taking turns  Online  No they both  Just sat there  For eighteen days  See that's just  Trying to get attention  And they didn't know  What they were waiting for  Yeah that's just  An attention thing  Not knowing  What they were even waiting  But it's  They hadn't announced it yet  It's gotta be good right  Right  Alright  Good news  One more clip  From Rachel  I'm number thirteen

[01:33:30]  Thanks for having me guys  Absolutely  Good morning  Good morning to you sir  And happy new year  To our Jewish friends  Ah it is  I'm a Jew  And it's our new year  What does that do  For the Jewish people  The new year  It's a new year  In the total sense  But if you try  And like kill yourself  Because of the depression  No one will care  Oh really still  You can't be like  Oh man I'm so down  It's 57 something else  And a half  I haven't achieved  Everything I wanted to  By this year  Why don't you guys  Get the big show  In Times Square  Well that's 
[01:34:00]  That's a good question  I really don't know  Why we don't drop  A ball  Or a  Yes  You know  A promise  Or something  You know  A sale  It's pretty easy stuff guys  You guys get really mad  When our new year  Comes around  Our new year  Yeah that's too  Or do you celebrate both  I get confused  I don't know  I don't know  The founders said  We should only have  One new year  Right  And it should always  Be hosted by  You know  Awkward chemistry  Whoever it is  Exactly  Yes  And a boy band 
[01:34:30]  Should lead it off  And I think  That's the way to do it  But  What do you think  About Barack Obama  Not meeting  If I may talk to a Jew  Not meeting  You represent all  Jewish people right now  I'll take it  Not meeting with  Netanyahu  May I talk with my hands  Please do  There's a lot of problems  In the Middle East  Right now  I don't know  What that is about  I have  I believe  It's some kind of  You know  One of these things  Where they're not talking  But they're really talking  You know what I'm saying  Oh  Kind of a kick under the table 
[01:35:00]  Gotcha thing  Yep  Alright  But I think  You know  Because of that film  Which by the way  Did you guys see it  It got a lot of bad  Oh yes  Yes  I gave it half a crescent  I don't know  What you guys thought  I thought it was  A brilliant tour de force  Well you know  It was the guy's first film  So give him a break  Come on  Right  Yeah exactly  Not everybody's Spike Lee  Right  You know  Not everybody can  Knock it out of the park  The first time  I thought it was great  I liked his use of green screening  Oh my gosh  Fantastic  Speaking of which  Yeah you know  I'll tell you  I don't know what's happening 
[01:35:30]  There with the Middle East  I just know one thing  We have to learn  How to either  Drill oil from the other way  Yeah  So that we don't deal with them  That would be a good idea  You know  Like basically steal their oil  Steal it  And or  What else can we do  Just like ignore them  Or my biggest idea  Which would be Powerball  I think that would take  Some of the mean out of them  Give them Powerball  Like you know  Like when it's a big Powerball here  Like even if it's like  Three like okay places  You know  Like people like 
[01:36:00]  Don't go to work  They get all  Like I think that would  Take some of the mean out of them  You know  And we'll like call it out  When they're doing the prayers  Yes  Like you know  Mind  Can I say it  You know  Yes of course  Mind fuck  Mind fuck  Okay there you go  Yeah  We curse here a lot  I promise not to  On this year  Oh really  The new Jew year  Yeah  Hey  This guy wants to know  About the two girls  You made out on stage  At your show the other night  I guess he's talking about governors  Yeah  Well you know  A lot of guys like to  Close strong with a joke  Right 
[01:36:30]  Not me  Just a couple of  Drunk chicks  Making out  No some girls  Started making out  On the stage  And like  I'm so old  Like if I was younger  I would have been like  Oh man this is cool  Now I'm like  You know  Gotta go  So  That's Long Island  But I have to tell you  The cool thing about that crowd  Was  A lot of guys I know  From high school were there  And before the show  This is like  I'm not  You know  But before the show  There was like 15 cop cars  In the parking lot  And I'm like  It has to be something  With that video  You know

Levity Live  Sounds better than  Half these places  We were promoting  Nuts yesterday  This is not  A goofy  Kind of  Yeah  Where was Nuts again?  Wilmington or something? 
[01:38:00]  It's just called Nuts?  Just Nuts  Because it's on  Nuts Road or Street  Who is that?  The General Pat  George Patton Club?  Nuts!  Nuts!  Nuts!  Do you take credit cards?  Nuts!  What does Levity Live  Really mean?  Levity Live  It's a beautiful club  It's gorgeous  It's in the mall  It's right across  From the arcade  Yes  Okay  And it's  You walk through  Home Depot  To get to it  There's a Home Depot  There  I believe there's  An IMAX theater  No Starbucks  Parking is the problem  No Starbucks  No really?  Nope  Whoa 
[01:38:30]  In Home Depot  But I don't like that shit  I want my Starbucks  Separate  I don't like when  It's part of another  Big store  In Home Depot  That's weird  And I don't know what part of Home Depot  Sawdust  I wasn't going to wander around there to get my coffee  You better drink as much coffee as possible  Before you get to  That's out  Out  Coffee's out  Yeah  You're going to need a carry permit  Hi Joe DeRosa  There he is  Take a seat Joe DeRosa  I hope I'm not interrupting  Well you are interrupting  You know it's called cock blind  But it is okay  You're just looking through 
[01:39:00]  There's nothing better on a Jewish New Year than a guy who might be Egyptian  Hey Joe  This is great right  Look at you two  Look at this  We're all here  Getting along  This is excellent  Where'd you guys get the books from?  We bought them  Yeah exactly  Thanks  On the black market  Well that's a nice surprise to see  A Man's Guide to Infidelity Cheat  By Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, and Robert Kelly  Dude  Amazing  Three dudes  That's right  Even the Constitution I think was written by less dudes  Right? 
[01:39:30]  Dave's quote is my favorite quote on the back of the book  You like it?  Yeah I love it  Oh that's cool  Do you want me to read it in person like it's one of those like spoken word kind of fruity things in LA?  Right on the back cover  I usually think reading is kind of fruity  But this book got me hard  What a great summer beach read  If the beach is in Haiti  Three dots  Three dots  That means pause in comedy  Yes pause  Obviously you liked his quote  Because it's right on the book itself  Yeah number three  And obviously you didn't think much of my story 
[01:40:00]  Because it's pretty much one of the last stories in the whole goddamn book  What's that about?  I would have been insulted if you called me up and said  You know what?  The story was lacking a little bit  We're going to do a little pass-a-roo on your story  No we connected the stories to the chapters they related to  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Mine is near the footnotes  No it's not  Yours is before Vance's story  And Vance's story might be the most important story in the book  And yours comes before that  Well then you're doing something wrong  If it's the most important story in the book 
[01:40:30]  And it's literally the last story in the book  Oh boy  Can we not give away the arc of the book here?  The arc of the book  Whoa  Jesus  And Anthony's got  Nice  He's got it  I mean  I got a good place for page 36  People will get to page 36  Oh yeah  My point is people will not get to 192  And I'm not saying it's because the book is bad  It's just how this works  No I'm telling you  Your story's in the right place  See Anthony's story is closer to the front  Because it's a little more of a harebrained  Typical thing 
[01:41:00]  As the story's about  Wow  You start learning a little more right  Yeah exactly  Yours was a better like  I'm a rookie  We're trying to learn here a little bit  I was terrible  Oh we're learning with this book  I thought you just threw a bunch of stories in a book  No they connect to the chapters  There is an arc to it  There isn't  There's a story  It's not fair  It's not fair  Because like  This is a  Let's face it  This is a toilet read  You know what I'm saying  I made a good one  A good one  While his story's out  You're like crowning  It's coming out  You're feeling good  Your body's working  But by my man over here 
[01:41:30]  You're washing your hands  You're using your feet  You're reading the story as you wipe  Yeah you're wiping  You're done  No one gets that far  In these type of books  Someone's knocking  Let me in  This will be a successful read  And all that  But it's one of those books  You don't have to read every story  Man I fucking fall into the category  Of guys that really fuck up  No no  That's not  See everybody's taking me  Out of context in here today  You better explain  Oh right  House of glass  What do you mean  We're taking you out  You just said 
[01:42:00]  We're taking you out  Listen my name's  Just on this thing  Context get it  No  Your story was a little more like  Okay if you're expecting  To hear a story about a guy  That got caught treating  This kind of  Treating  Treating  Treating or cheating  What's called treating  Like I'm sweating  I rode my bike over here  Of course  Where's the helmet  Judge Dwedd  I didn't bring it  Oh shit  I didn't bring the helmet  You're a rebel now  Because I'm sick of it  Wait after the show  Can we go see Judge Dwedd  Getting great reviews 
[01:42:30]  In the paper that  It is  One star  One star  Yeah I'm not going to  Climb an embassy wall  For that  So now what happened  My story  I feel that your story  Related to some of the  Earlier stuff in the book  Because it set up more like  You know  What you would expect  When you're expecting  And then later in the book  It got a little more  We got a little more  Into the pockets of this stuff  And some of the stuff  That's a little more  Off the table usually  And then some stories  Fit better into that stuff  So it's not bad  Or good either way 
[01:43:00]  You're saying mine  Is just your run of the mill  Fucking cheating story  I'm saying Ant  That you know  You really don't have  Any experience  In this life  My story has celebrity in it  Right  It has  It doesn't have celebrity  Who  It has  Intrigue  Conflict  Intrigue  Intrigue  We don't mention any names  I know  But everyone  Joe  When did you guys realize  You didn't have enough material  And you slapped my story  In a who gives a fuck chapter  At the end of the book  To make it look a little thicker  For everybody  I'm glad I came in  To push the book today 
[01:43:30]  It's really doing wonders  192  It's going to help for sales  192  And I love that  It's in Mao Red  Communist Red  I really am  Communist Red  A manifesto  You've written there  That's a pretty fucking book man  I actually read an earlier  Thank you  Joe I read an earlier version  Of this book  And before we continue  To kick your ass  And beat you up a little bit  I liked it  Good  I'm glad you enjoyed it  I did like it  But I did not get  All the way to the end  I'll tell you what you could do  When you get your copy  Of this book  I got it right here  You can rip out your story 
[01:44:00]  And tape it anywhere you like  And glue it to the front  Yeah just pull the pages out  Put it in the front  Oh  Get it  I like that  Treating  Treating  So what's your  Sorry  So this is cool  That you guys did this  When did you guys decide  That like  Between the three of us  We have a story  I mean  Am I saying it the wrong way  But when did you guys  Like inspire to do this  We  Bobby and my manager  Yawn  Said  He said  When we put the movie out 
[01:44:30]  And it went into Tribeca  He was like  I think you guys can make a movie  Or write a book about this  It would be a funny book  Wow  So then we called Bill  And we were like  Are you into this  He's like yeah  And that was it  We just wrote it  And it was fucking  A lot of  This book's only  A hundred and whatever pages  This was the most work  I've ever done  Ever in my life  For anything  It was fucking  Even with two other guys  It was brutal  I can tell you how many pages  Oh  Just get to your story  And then  Look at the page number  Get to my story  And then add ten  Oh boy

[01:45:30]  Right now  This is disgraceful  That our names  Are on a fucking publication  That's great  How do the people get the book  What's up  How do they get the book  There's no more bookstores  I don't know where  It's going to be  It's going to be  In all the bookstores  And online  And all that stuff  I'm actually really  Wait that's my question  There are no bookstores  Well there's still  Barnes and Noble  And there's still  Stores out there  They even got rid  Of the big one  Near MSG  Well the ones that are left  It'll be in the ones  That are left  And online  Fair enough  Maybe in an airport  Bookstore  Yeah the airport bookstore  That'd be good 
[01:46:00]  That's a good market  For you guys  I'm just happy  Because I always wanted  To have my comedy CD  In a store  And then that  They closed  So I'm happy  I have something  In a store  Before I die  Nice  I want to ask  David Tell  About the iPhone 5  We did a lot of  Material on that today  Because people  Have been waiting  Online  People are so excited  So excited  No more than the  Eight year old  Chinese kids  Who made them  Yes  We were talking  About them  That's one of their names  Yeah  Sorry  Too quick for you  We were talking  About those

[01:47:00]  Take away his job  Right  Like all these  People's jobs  Look at that  Fucking scumbag  Yeah  In front of the  Apple store  That's the guy  That you're going  To stop and go  Let me hear  What you gotta say  Yeah let me hear  What your opinion is  He looks too  Bathe  Yeah  Exactly  Supposedly he's homeless  He looks like  He's got giantism  Why is Lou Diamond  Phillips working  The camera  This is like  One of those  Remember the  Kids World Reporters  It's like  Teens talking to teens  About teen stuff  To get their perspective  Yo man 
[01:47:30]  Now they're represented  Not cool  Today on Kids Beat  Right  I don't know  So I don't know  What the deal is  With the iPhone thing  But it's the only thing  That seems to be selling  So I guess  We have to go with it  And I think it's  I'd say it's wrong  But it's kind of cool  That people are crashing  Cars to get them  Which is kind of weird  Because you don't see  The guys who work there  Right  Who are really  Cyborg robot people  And I want to see them  Use their like  Magical robot powers  To fight them  So you know  I don't know 
[01:48:00]  I don't know what to tell you  I think it's  You know personally  Who really cares  Am I right or what  I remember  I remember when Siri came out  You guys were excited  Oh so excited  I never knew this  Siri's kind of cool  Thanks  The question is  We went around  The room earlier  Have you ever  Waited online  For a ridiculous  Amount of time  For anything  No  I wouldn't even  Wait online for a kidney  Why  I would not  I hate lines  I'm with you on that  Totally  It's terrible  And they were talking  About the iPhone  And a lot of these people  Wait online  Sam asked them 
[01:48:30]  So what is it  About the iPhone  What do you like  About  None of them even knew  What any of the new features  What they just had to buy it  No one knows what it does  But they had to have it  You got that ratio clip again  You're not going to get it  I'm going to get it  But I'm not  I'm not going crazy  About getting it  Tomorrow you can walk  To the store and get it  I haven't pre-ordered it  And I'm not going  To stand online  I'm not going  To the store  And go to my source  That'll get me in  I'll just wait  I'm not  But Ann  After the showbiz  Written story  You regaled us with  For our book  Don't you have

[01:49:30]  And then you get  To press a button  And it blows up  Wouldn't that be cool  I would really love  To do that  That's worth it  That is worth it  Yeah I'd like that  I ran into both of you guys  At the Apple store  When the last iPhone  Came out  Crazy  Not me  No both of you guys  Were there  And it was weird  Because you were  Way at the front of the line  And they made  Opie stand  Way in the back  Oh see  See what he does  See what he does  Sam  See  See what he did there  I think I was  36th online  I liked it  I hope it was  190th online  That's funny  Oh my god

[01:50:30]  They don't get them in  Every day  They do  But then they're sold out  In an hour  Oh boy  He believes this shit  No I  When the last one came out  I was going in the stores  Nobody had them  And you had to  I had to wait  It was like a month  Before you could just  Walk in and just buy  Can we get one Apple employee  To admit that they have  Plenty of iPhone 5's  But they have to tell people  At a certain point  We have sold out  There's transmitters  In their throat  Apple knows everything  They say  My point is  Whether that's true  Or not true  It will still be a month  Before you can just  Walk into the store  At any time of day 
[01:51:00]  And just buy it  Nope  You can't just walk  A couple days  A few days  Sam a month  A month really  I mean  It'll be  Three weeks at least  Yeah  I'm going to wait a year  How about that  You know what  Thank you Sam  You're welcome Joe  I appreciate that  Sam let's keep track of this  To see if Joe was  Yeah come on  I say within a week  I'll be an iPhone 10 out there  A year  I mean  It won't be  It's a big deal  I'm going to wait  It'll be like an Xbox  Of the same like smallness  Or something right  I mean Joe  You're a high tech guy

[01:52:00]  Sam you want to explain  To David Tell  Yeah please  Well Dave  Last time Joe was in  He was making fun  Of Troy Kwan's appearance  His wardrobe  His hairstyle  He works for the show  He's like  He's an older guy  But he dresses  A little younger  Than he should  Was he in the  South of me  His army  Troy Kwan  He was a colonel  Troy Kwan  Exactly  He's a Brooklyn hipster  There  Oh he's right  I'm sorry  See how you don't try  With your look  And it is a look  Because you don't try  He's making believe  He doesn't try  But obviously  He's trying really hard 
[01:52:30]  It makes a huge effort  That's the difference  But I don't  Do you think he looks like  He's going for the  I don't try look  I think he's going for the  I want to fuck a 19 year old look  He's trying to like  Ah this is kind of  Throwing this shit on right now  He's not that old  He's 34  33  No he's older than  You know Caucasian years  How old is he  Like like 50  So he's still mad at you  He pulled Sam aside  No shit  He's a little  He's a little  So you want to bring him in here for a sec  They have Sam aside nets  That are hanging  Oh what 
[01:53:00]  Are you guys stirring up the shit  Or is he really still mad  Oh he's still mad  Yesterday he told me  He was still  He's still a little hot under the collar  About last time  Why  Quick go to page 82  How to handle the disgruntled agent  Quick  He  He  Listen  It's fucking  Here comes Troy Kwan  David Hell  There he is  He doesn't look Asian to me  No he's not  Isn't that weird  That's fine  I just said something to Sam  The other day  What did you say to Sam  I just 
[01:53:30]  I don't know  Joe just rubbed me the wrong way that day  And I just  I'm having a hard time letting it go  Why  Listen  What got to you  Well just because he just took a shot for no reason  And it just seems like  Oh boy  Like we were cool  And then he just had nothing to say that day  It was just like  Oh let's just fucking take a shot  No I had something to say  It was about your stupid fucking shoes  I really thought you were Asian  I didn't know  Yeah Troy Kwan sounds like  He didn't hear that Joe DeRosa  I thought that was a good slay of things  What was it again  A little chuckle out of Ant  But he didn't hear it  He needs to hear that  What did you say  I missed it  No forget it 
[01:54:00]  Listen  Here's the thing  Is I was  I was joking around with you that day  About your shoes  And your skateboard  And we were fucking around  And then I immediately  Immediately felt bad  Because we're friends  I was like  And I even said on the air  Troy  I'm really sorry dude  I  I  You gave me a nice pounding back  I was asking for this  I was just bored  I felt like trashing somebody  I was wrong  I fucking admitted it  Three times in the air  You were the one  That wouldn't let it go dude  You just kept coming at me after that  I was like dude 
[01:54:30]  You got me  Because he started it  That's just the way it goes  Oh boy  So what  If a guy hits you first  Do you beat him to death  Yeah  That's not even that funny  Yes it is  What are you 33's or 78's  I need to know  The four people I needed to let  It's sort of funny  Imagining you at records  That's the way Joe is  Do you picture him  Working in an independent record store  Is that what that was about  I just pictured him doing a Laro and Hardy  Like taking out a record 
[01:55:00]  And going  Watching it shatter on a guy's head  Last record store  Dave I'm sorry to hear for this  This is going to get  A little bit uncomfortable  That's the way Joe is  Sort of funny  We heard you the first time  We heard it the first time  I missed it the first time  So listen  Troy  I missed it  Do you live in Brooklyn really?  No I don't  So yeah  So why are you throwing  That Brooklyn thing on him?  Yeah Joe  I didn't throw that Brooklyn thing on him  Okay he's a Brooklyn hipster though  Yeah he said it  Where do you live there?  I live on the Upper East Side 
[01:55:30]  But I'm living  So Troy  This whole time  I thought you lived in Brooklyn  That's his vibe  It's his vibe right?  Brooklyn vibe?  I would agree  I would be surprised  Because the Upper East Side  Doesn't have a vibe  It's a hip town  That's a hipster area too  That's a cool area  Hold on a sec  I don't know anything anymore  I look at the Kennedy Airport  What can I do?  This is my fucking gripe  With certain people  Involved with the show  Certain people  Oh wow  This is what bothers me with you 
[01:56:00]  We fucking slam each other constantly here  You think I haven't come in here  And gotten trashed for no apparent reason?  Never  You think Sam's never gotten trashed for no apparent reason?  That's fine  And if Sam has a problem  Somebody he'll take it up with him  But here's my thing Troy  It's like  There's no fucking way in hell  That's the first time  You've been trashed on this show  By a comic that's come in here  And did you hold a grudge  With anybody else?  Or are you fucking holding a grudge with me  Because I'm the easy guy  To hold a grudge with  Because I'm not Burr  Or Patrice  Or one of those guys  Well I mean  None of those guys have said anything  Well Patrice said something before  But I mean  I'm not gonna fucking go after him 
[01:56:30]  He's crazy  Why?  He's fucking a lunatic  No because that's pussy shit  You won't go after Patrice  But you'll go after me?  So you're not gonna fight back at all  So you admit that you're not even  In the same league as that  No that's not what I'm saying  What I'm saying is  You want to pick and choose  Who you'll be mad about  And whatever  And you're looking at me  And going  It's easy for me to be mad at Joe  Because I think I'm a worthy adversary of his  But whereas I think Patrice  Would have stopped me out  So I won't fucking say shit back to him  Well I mean you gotta choose your battles right?  If you're a pussy  Oh  So you're gonna go after somebody like that? 
[01:57:00]  I go after anybody that goes after me  And then when they go  I'm sorry  I was fucking around  And we laugh about it  And I go  It's all good dude  That's what we do in here  And it's like  You're walking around  Holding a fucking grudge about it  That's the way I am  Why the grudge?  Because you have been trashed  By a lot of people Troy  Well it just  He's just  I don't know  Joe just rubs me the wrong way  And I thought we were cool  We were  And I thought we were now  You took all these fucking bullshit shots  And I was like  What was the shot that got to you?  And so did you  Oh yeah  It's just  The skateboard thing  Pulling it out of the fucking blue  Just pulling it out of the blue 
[01:57:30]  Jesus  Out of the fucking blue  It's all right  Troy listen  And I'm allowed to not like you  Yeah he is  Okay that's fine Troy  I want you to listen  But you're carrying a lot of anger  I want you to go home today  I want you to really turn that house music up loud  I want you to work through it  Do a nice hard workout to it today  And get this out of your system  Because I apologized that day  And go Troy  I was fucking around  We're friends  Just like we all fuck around  Like how is that an insult?  That's stupid  Because you don't listen to house music right?  Well yeah  I listen to house music  Of course I listen to house music  I DJ have it  Of course 
[01:58:00]  But why is that an insult?  It's like  Joe why is that an insult?  Because I thought it was  Are you not funny?  That's because you're not funny  Oh wow  You're taking it to the level  Now that's  True  I might not be funny  In comedy  You know  But it's  I don't know  How do you call yourself a comedian?  At least I don't  Really?  Really?  Really?  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I call myself a comedian  Because I make my fucking living from it  You know what I don't do?  I can't believe people pay for that  Is work at a fucking radio show all day 
[01:58:30]  And then pretend to be a DJ at night  Oh  How does that pretend?  Because you don't  Then go make your living being a DJ  I make more money DJing than I do here  Then why are you here?  Because why not?  Why?  Are you here to promote your DJ sets?  Well sometimes yeah  Are you here to be part of the radio commute?  Why do you have another job?  If that's such  If you're making real fucking money being a DJ  And that's your thing  Why do you have another fucking job?  Well I mean it's expensive to live in New York  You know that  Yeah I know  And I enjoy doing both things  So what's wrong with that?  Paying bills with comedy  Does anybody see of that show Girls? 
[01:59:00]  You ever see that show?  Yes  It's like a lot of tension  Guys you gotta like bury the hatchet  You're both artists  Girls  Good Dave  Good  You're a comic writer, author  He's a DJ and radio guy  So come on  Between the two of you  If you can't afford a one bedroom somewhere  Between the two of you  And some help from your family  There's no reason why you guys can't  Rent a basement somewhere in Big Ridge  So we shouldn't have  Is that funny dude?  Or not?  No that's good  You're hysterical 
[01:59:30]  But Joe isn't  Joe is very funny  This is what  Wait so we shouldn't have Joe on the  We shouldn't have Joe on the show anymore?  Are you asking my opinion?  Yeah  I think Joe's on too much  Whoa  Jesus  What is this?  What is this?  Egypt?  Go deliver your fucking papers  And get somebody coffee  That's not funny  Or do whatever the fuck it is you do  I'm not trying to be funny  Get out of here while you can  Go fucking do what you do  If you're such a fucking DJ  Go be a DJ  If you're not a fucking DJ  Then work in radio  But don't fetch coffee during the day 
[02:00:00]  And DJ at night  And then come in here  I sit in a production studio  And work in Pro Tools all day  What do you do?  I don't get coffee  I do all the imaging  That's on this fucking channel  Oh my god  Troy  Oh  Jesus  Jesus  The imaging?  Yeah that's what I do  That's my job  What does that even mean?  That's like coffee  Of course you don't know  What the fuck that means  What does that mean Joe?  Wow  Bill Burrs in the studio  Why is the part time rapper  Screaming at the part time DJ?  Whoa  Whoa  Troy  He'd either be a fucking comedian  Or be a rapper 
[02:00:30]  Oh shit  Joe it's too early  To be yelling like this  Troy's got a problem  He's coming in with his problem  Bill let me explain really fast  These two went at it  I don't know  A month or two ago  And made fun of how  Each other dresses  And it was a funny little bit  Everyone laughed  And it was a little ugly  But we got through it  But Troy Kwan  Is still holding a grudge  So we invited him  In here today  To try to find out  Why the fuck  Is he holding a grudge  And he's holding his ground  Like a man though  Now he's saying  That Joe DeRose is not funny 
[02:01:00]  He said he was a faggot  So he saw him sucking  A guy's cock out  By the dumpster  I can see all of it  Yeah yeah sure  I mean if he asked my opinion  I gave it  That's what it is  Troy I get it  Troy you wear it on your sleeve  Troy you don't pull any punches  I get it  Talking to Kenny  About interrogation  He's letting me know  The way he's standing  Is a very defensive  Very defensive  Yet confident  Troy Kwan arms crossed  He's angry  Well Joe because you're  Attacking his dream here  I mean I came in  In the middle of it  You just sound like  A very mean  Mean spirited person 
[02:01:30]  You missed the whole part  Where he said  I wasn't funny  Easy Bill Clinton  That he doesn't get out  I'm a comic  You missed all that  That was a retort  Troy doesn't even know  How he makes money in comedy  That was a fucking retort  That's the truth  Oh man  I don't know  Do you really not know Troy  I've been told many times  And he's very funny  You really not know Troy  Because you told me I was funny  Up until I made fun  Of your fucking stupid shoes  Now I don't know  I don't know if I've ever  Told you that you were funny  I don't know if I've ever  Thought that  Have you ever told anybody  That wasn't a 19 year old  Hipster trick  That you were trying to finger  In the back of a fucking dance  Oh Joe  Oh Joe  Oh Joe  Jesus  Jesus  Now come on 
[02:02:00]  Now that fucking  Now I'm getting it  Insulted there Joe  Jesus  Wow Joe  That was a little too much  And I'm sorry  Come on now  Fucking  Troy comment  I don't even know  I wasn't even paying attention  They said you're trying to finger  That's what it is  Communication  Troy you're working radio  You guys have to go  On a zipline trip somewhere  I don't see why  It's such a big thing  You guys like are both  Two you know 
[02:02:30]  Dudes like New York  I figure you guys  Would go out  And hit the scene  Look here's why  There's a thing  Is because we fucked around  I apologized to him  Three times a day  And Troy I would say  Got the fucking better of me  That day on the show  Oh absolutely  I went after him  Oh boy  It's just  Dr. Steve got the best of you  The last time you were on  Jesus  I mean what is it  I mean no offense  To Dr. Steve  But  Yeah Joe  It's this world coming to  Yeah  Let me finish my point  Because this guy's such a  Fucking hot headed little girl  That you can't even  Fucking  As opposed to the  Even keeled  Joe DeRosa 
[02:03:00]  Joe DeRosa  You walked in  Joe was screaming  Four hours sleep  Oh yeah I wanted to go back  To bed when I heard that  DJing in a best bar  Using fucking  I'm like Jesus Christ  Just want to come in  And say hi to the guys  Have a fucking  Breakfast sandwich Joe  But let Joe finish his point  Here's my point  This is why I'm fucking  Worked up about it  Is because  This is why I'm hot  Under the collar  We did the thing  And again  I'm admitting  I'm saying  Troy got the fucking 
[02:03:30]  Better of me that day  And I even said  On the fucking air  Multiple times  Troy  I came at you  For no reason  You know how it is  Sometimes you want to  Trash people  And I just came after you  I shouldn't have done that  And he can't let it go  Yeah I can't  He can't let it go  So that's fine  That you can't let it go  I wasn't screaming at you  When you walked in here  Because you couldn't let it go  I started fucking yelling at you  Because you're sitting there now  Taking shots at my fucking livelihood  And trying to get me off  The fucking show  What kind of fucking man are you  Seriously  Well first of all  Like I said 
[02:04:00]  Opie asked my opinion  And I asked  I said  Do you want to know my opinion  That's my opinion  I know I love it  Wow  Oh I forgot  And the biggest bitch move of all  Is when you're fucking  You're taking shots at my livelihood  So go fuck yourself  After you took shots at mine  You're going to dish it out  Stop taking shots  At each other's livelihoods  Take a knee ladies  Take a knee  Exactly  By the way Bill  John don't point at me  At my livelihood  Don't you point at me  At my livelihood  Who the fuck says livelihood  Livelihood  My livelihood  Is this Bormark Empire 
[02:04:30]  What's going on  We gotta move that hooch  By the way  And you come in here  And you're taking shots  At my livelihood  By the way  You're going to get that  Tattooed on your own  You fucking moron  Holy shit  Why don't you go after him a little bit  Why are you coming at me  Because you're the one I heard screaming  Yeah and you missed the first half of it  He's keeping his composure  That's right  His tattoos are more colorful  You're right  Because you never scream ever  You're a real quiet guy 
[02:05:00]  Joe if anybody knows  This is fucking anger time  Joe you've been yelling livelihood  At like 8.19 in the morning  Here's my point  That's wrong with you  As soon as he said  Joe I don't care  As soon as he said  I don't care  Sit down Joe  It got ugly  As soon as he said  That he wouldn't go after  A guy like Patrice  That he wouldn't go after  A guy like Patrice  But he'd come after  A guy like me  That's a fucking bullshit  Joe this is supposed to be  An enjoyable experience  It is  I'm having a great time  Obviously  Joe all of a sudden  By the way  For you listeners 
[02:05:30]  Joe bolted to his feet  At a certain point  In this conversation  You just bolted to your feet  I'm sitting back there  I thought it was going to be a fight  Joe is Troy wearing  The proper sneakers today  Look  I'm not going to add fuel  To the fire  Okay  You don't like him though  Fuel to the fire  And your livelihood  God damn it  Why don't you two  Just use a little elbow grease  And try to  Patch things up  Joe's been yelling  For 45 minutes  And then goes  I'm not going to add fuel  To the fire  He should have  He should have wrote  A book on puns  Yeah look at you 
[02:06:00]  How about this guys  That's not a pun  Fellers  Fuel to the fire  Fellers  Now I'm embarrassed  If we take you two  And we just tie your  Like legs or arms together  In some kind of  Star Trek kind of fight  With just one new iPhone  Right  And you have to beat  The other guy to death  With it  Would you do it  If the winner doesn't  Get the eye  You wouldn't do it  No  Okay good  I don't think that's right  Can we have closing statements  I love all this fake seriousness here  By the way  This is what's wrong  With today's comedy  No I was just  Honestly I'm just saying  If you go to any comedy club 
[02:06:30]  In America right now  This is happening  To some degree  Which is like  Somebody taking a comment  Way too seriously  And then the comic  Having to defend  Way too hard  And then back and forth  And you know  And then it gets way too  Serious sounding  Yeah  There you go  Well dude  I actually think  They're just reading  Like a Twitter argument  Like I don't think  This is any dialogue  Transcripts from our  Twitter argument  I'm not gonna lie  I'm fucking pissed off  It's like when a guy  When a guy comes in  And goes  Goes hey man  I don't fucking take shit  With this  With this brash  And then says  Well I wouldn't go at Patrice 
[02:07:00]  Cause you know  You pick your battles  That's fucking bitch shit  Okay  He's coming in here  He's trying to bitch me out  He's fucking telling you guys  I'm on the show too much  He's trying to fuck with me  And it's bullshit  I fucking apologized  To you like a man  And if you had a fucking  Problem with it that day  You should have told me  You had a problem  With it that fucking day  Well it stewed with me  A little bit  You stewed around  Like a little girl  For fucking two months  About it  If you're so confident  In your fucking comedic abilities  What does my opinion matter  Troy it's just  It's just something  You don't do  Why  Who cares  It's like a customer  That goes and complains  And goes  I want my money back 
[02:07:30]  I'm offended  I don't like the taste  Of these wings  Can I have my money back  What do you think  About these wings  And you give your opinion  About it  OBS my opinion  I don't think you're funny  I don't know why  You don't think I'm funny  Since I fucked with you that day  I don't know if I never  Really ever thought  You've said anything funny  On this show  You've come to my shows  Wow Troy  You've come to my stand up shows  I did and I  I couldn't leave  And you told me  I was funny after  Holy shit  And you told me  I was funny after  Why did you  I locked the doors  At your comedy shows 
[02:08:00]  So no one could leave  Is that what you're pulling  I brought a date  This is true  I didn't tell him that though  I brought a date  And I was embarrassed  I was embarrassed  I was like  Oh shit  You were embarrassed  This is lively  Then why did you  Go out of your way  To tell me how funny  You thought the show was  I said hey great show  Just as in like  Hey good job buddy  Troy you know what  Go fuck yourself  Go fuck yourself  I hope you fall off  A fucking DJ riser  And split your head open  That's not true  I really fucking do  I really do  I hope you have  Fucking OD  On whatever ecstasy  You're taking  At this fucking rape tonight 
[02:08:30]  Nothing would make me happier  Than seeing you convulse  And foam from the fucking mouth  On the floor  It would really make me fucking happy  This is some good stuff Troy  He's a comedic genius  Joe DeRosa  Have you ever seen him live  So let's hear your opinion  On his craft  Oh good question  I was there  I'm trying to say  It's ready to go  People have stopped being polite  And are starting to get real  I felt that the beats  Weren't blending properly  There you go  It's all criticism guys  Do you have respect 
[02:09:00]  For DJs  I love DJs  Not what he does  But I respect  I respect  Like him  DJ the livelihood  Being shot  You're taking shots  At their livelihood  It's not a livelihood  When you do it  For free at night  That's not livelihood  I could pay a lot of money  That's not a job  Then quit here  Why do I have to  I make money doing a copy  You see me running around  Fucking imaging  For serious radio  If you do two things  If you do two different things  Why not do both  That was very good 
[02:09:30]  Bill  That was funny right  You've walked right into  The fucking  You know  The hornet's nest here  I literally said  I said you want me to  Stay outside  Until this blows over  I wanted you to  Come in here  The more the merrier  With this shit  It was really just  A simple question  I didn't realize  He was angry  Classic case  Dishing out but can't take it  It's okay when we  Fuck with E-Rock  It's okay when we  Fuck with Sam  It's okay when I  Get fucked with  When Ant or Opie  Gets fucked with  Hey leave me out of this  When Bobby gets called  Fat for 90 minutes  Straight in  That's all fine  But you know  But Troy  You know  Okay it's precious ground

[02:12:00]  Shut the fuck up  No I'm not going to  Shut the fuck up  You came in here  Asking for something  I'm giving it to you  They called me in  I know right  Well what do you want  I gave my opinion  To somebody on the staff  He wanted to the show  So that's  You sort of turned into  Like a hipster  Steven Seagal movie  Troy you could have  Pulled me aside  And said dude  I didn't appreciate that  And I would have said  Troy I'm sorry  But if you don't think  I can leave till 5 o'clock  I'll walk out with you  I'll just ride the elevator  Down with you  What do you think of that  Jesus fucking Christ  Go ahead Troy  I blame it on that movie  When am I supposed to be scared  That you want to ride  The elevator down with me  Well you said 
[02:12:30]  I can't do that  So watch  Watch me do it  You know he could hit  All the floors  And that takes a long time  Exactly  That would piss me off  Well I'm going to just wait  And say Joe is very funny  And if you guys have a problem  Now it's to the next level  So I think the gloves are off  You guys should really go at it  Maybe something for charity  Do I do something for charity  Maybe something for charity  A boxing match  Do we got an agree to disagree situation  In the studio right now  We got an agree to  No I think that they were working towards  An understanding 
[02:13:00]  A solution  Yeah  Should we have closing statements  It felt like it tipped  And we were like  Kind of maybe going to get there  I was being sarcastic  I was being sarcastic  Now it's over  I really thought it got so heated  That we were going to tip it  To like fuck it  Now there's no way  We ain't like a man  Should we do closing statements  Well I would just say  I thought Troy and I were friends  And I thought  I'm sorry Dave  I cut you off  I didn't mean to  I was just going to say  I think the audience  Should decide by downloading your album  What's it called  Sorry to be the Jew here 
[02:13:30]  But might as well make a little money  Off your terror  No go ahead  I'm sorry Joe  I stepped on you  No I was just going to say  I thought Troy and I were friends  You know what Troy  I'll say it to you directly  You got some sad music  To play underneath  Oh yeah we do  Hang on  Hang on  Yeah go ahead  What do you want  What kind of sad do you think  Like the good wife  That kind of stuff  Everybody hurts  Oh that's nothing  E-Rock  There you go  Everybody hurts  Are you that maybe  That's a missing somebody  Kind of tune  I thought  Hold on hold on  We don't have the music yet  Thanks to E-Rock  Come in

[02:53:00]  Why  Because they kind of do a little rap  They do not  I was a musician  You mean you were in a band  Well yeah  I played music  That's what I did  That's why there's a lot of tension between you and uh  What's his name  Troy  Troy Kwan  He's uh  That's what I was trying to make a career out of it  I mean I don't know  I've seen Joe's in karaoke  He's pretty god damn good  Thank you  Yeah  Thank you  I was a scientist  How many years have you been doing comedy Joe?

[02:56:30]  Even come out  Because you were saying  What I did before comedy  Yeah  I was just talking about  Because you played music  I guess  Yeah  You know  I don't  You know  I'm very on edge right now  I feel like  I've seen that  I feel like  You've calmed down outside  It looks like you're  But I feel like  There's another trash  You're reacting to being  You're like you're being  Interrogated  You see us all  Just staring at you  Yeah  Trying to figure out  Where we're going to  Start first  I don't know  What's serious  I don't know  What's a joke  I don't know  What's an insult  Right now  I'm just very like 
[02:57:00]  I got my fucking  Censors on  I see that  I don't know  You know  Joe's very like  A reality show star today  He's very like  Omarosa  You know  Just kind of  All spinning around him  Yeah  I was in a bad mood  When I got here  Why were you in a bad mood  Let's go with that  For a second  Because I rode  I got a bike  And I rode my bike over  And you know  Where's the bike?  It's outside  I chained it up  So it's you know  Just for exercise  You know  Much I hope  It's not there  That would make me  Hatter  Shane and the one  Busted link  And he's standing there  With his broken heart 
[02:57:30]  And his helmet  Huh?  Oh never mind  You moved  I'm sorry  I thought you still  Lived in the old place  Which is two blocks away  I'm like that's a  Hell of a workout routine  No I live down  In Gramercy now  But I've been riding around  And I noticed  There are guys  Mainly in trucks  That do this thing  They think it's fucking funny  But as they  You know  You're riding on the street  In New York  It's really fucking scary  Like you have to be  Very alert  Not just for cars  Like potholes  You just have to be  Looking constantly  Doors opening  Yeah  Hazards  There's all kinds of hazards 
[02:58:00]  There's hazards  Pitfalls as we call them  But guys in trucks  A lot of the time  They like to drive  Like as they're going by you  They scream out the window  At you  Which  It's funny  Yeah dude it's funny  You could fucking die dude  Well it's funny  If I don't know the person  Never heard that  It's like  I get how funny it is  Like it makes me laugh  Let's ask Troy Kwan  If that's funny  But when you're in the moment  It's fucking  You're like  It literally could be your life  What do you think's happening  Like someone's hitting you  You think like  They're going to drive into you  Do you swerve into parked cars 
[02:58:30]  How bad does it get for you  When they do that  No you just  You jump  I mean it makes you go like that  Joe do you  Do you do anything  Where you don't get picked on  Well I gotta say  I've ridden a bike  In the city  And no one has ever done that to me  There's just something about you Joe  Yeah  I mean it helps your comedy  But like there's just something  You know  About you  That people just  They just don't respect you  A genius is often  A genius is often misunderstood  Oh yeah  Okay  Much aligned  He's ahead of his time 
[02:59:00]  With his dick and shit jokes  That's kind of funny  That they scream like that  And they hope you make a move  Or something  In the moment  It's the like  Least funny thing ever  It's infuriating  So can you laugh at yourself  After the fact  Yeah after I scream  You fucking cocksucker  At the truck  I bet  Just throwing gas in the fire  Like oh my god  Drive around again  Yeah yeah  This guy's playing along  Fucking cocksucker  That would make it worthwhile  Because he got pissed  Like I'd hate it  If he just kept riding 
[02:59:30]  And did nothing  You'd be like  Ah fuck  I would ride a bike  Just for the amount of people  That are texting while driving  Yes  And that you always drift  Always drift over  Yeah it's fucking scary man  But Joe you're staying alert out there  You know you got your head on a swivel  I got my head on a swivel  And I'm going without the helmet  These days  Oh shit  That's crazy  How about you do a helmet  I had one  I looked so ridiculous in it  That I don't want to wear it  And what you got to carry that bag  With your fucking helmet in it  Everywhere  Yeah it's annoying  It's bad if you got to carry  The water bottle  Yeah  I used to leave this on the bike  And then I realized 
[03:00:00]  Why are you carrying a water bottle  Oh man  It's pissing  I used to realize  That bum's probably sucking on you  While you're in the building  I just buy a bottle of water from someone  Why do you carry the water  Because where are you going to carry  You got to carry it in the holder  You can't carry a bottle of water  No when you don't you bike ride  You slam a bottle of water  Huh  When you don't you bike ride  I need it while I'm riding  You get thirsty  You need a drink  How many miles do you ride  What is he  Lex Armstrong  I know  He just  He's Joe  We saw him the other night  Yeah  Me and Bobby were watching him  And just watching him  Putting on his gear 
[03:00:30]  And I was just like  He just looked like  The most muggable  Oh shit  A mark  Yeah he's just like  What kind of bike gear do you have  He's got a nice bike  He has a nice bike  It's an alright bike  Yeah  Hybrid  Hybrid  Went with a hybrid  Not the mountain bike  I went with the hybrid  Nice  I went with the hybrid  Because a lady  That I met 10 minutes  Before I bought it  Told me to get a hybrid  I didn't know anything  And I was like  I think I need a bike  And I just went up to a bike lady  And I go  Hey what do you have  And she goes  I'd get a hybrid  And I was like  Okay  And I went right to the store  And I was like 
[03:01:00]  I need a hybrid  I started just regurgitating  Everything she said  Again like the iPhone people  It's cheap  Are you old enough  Where they tried to upgrade you  With the bigger  More comfortable  Prostate friendly seat  No actually  I asked the guy that  I go  Should I get a better seat  And he's like  No just ride the thing  If you don't like it  Then you get a seat  Bicycle seats are the worst  Very fair  Like the most uncomfortable things  Yeah  They're a little tiny fucking  Just put your asshole on it  Balance  Balance on your taint  Yeah  Balance on the undercarriage 
[03:01:30]  Yeah  Joe next time a guy  Like tries to cut you off  And you pull up  Next time you should throw  Your fucking book  Right in his car  Oh man  That's right  That'll show  Look what I did  Yeah  Hey do you guys have  What did you do today  What did you do today  Do you guys have  I don't have time  Driving off furniture  Do you guys have  Stories in that book  Did you guys  I mean not  You wrote the book  Obviously but  Do you have  Cheat stories in there  Yeah we all do  Oh you all have  Your little personal  Oh yeah that wouldn't be fair  It wouldn't be  Do yours work out well  Or oh we're gonna have  To buy the book  Nah it's all in the book 
[03:02:00]  It's all in the book  You're able to say that now  Can I ask  How long did it take  To write it  Like all  Forever  About a year  Really  Wow damn  But I mean a lot of that  Was just  A lot of that was just  Getting everybody together  On you know  To go over the material  That takes  Forever to coordinate schedules  And then once it was done  There was like  You just glossed over  So much shit  I mean but you know  The amount of times  Just sitting there  Tapped out  Dude I got nothing  I'm done  I don't know  What else the fuck 
[03:02:30]  Can I write here  Dude I will never  I will never do it again  Really it was that bad  I don't think I could  Write a book on my life  I just  Yeah you know  I'm out of shit  I was a kid  And uh  And then I went to high school  And I didn't do well  Yeah how do you put  Then I started doing comedy  That's the first 20 years  Of my life  I could do it  In like fucking half a page  You gotta make it entertaining  And then how do you  Where do you put everything  And make it different  Then you're just  Spealing about your life  We somehow did it  That's so funny  It took three of us  That's  Like the moon dogs  That's what I was gonna say 
[03:03:00]  That was the worst part  Of the writing process  Was like  After we thought it was done  We're like  We did it  Fuck  It's done  Then they were like  No now we have to go through  Multiple edits  And the copy edit  Which chapter should go to the next  In front of the next chapter  You never think of that  Yeah  Where do you stop  It literally  When they did that  When the editor called with that news  It literally felt like  In Batman Begins  After he climbs that mountain  And they're like  Now you will fight  And he's like  I can't even stand up  Please don't make us do this  Can we check with Troy

[03:15:30]  God damn it  We should show it off  A little bit  Well Bill  I wasn't saying  There's a good  Right way  Or wrong way  To handle it  But if you look  Now they were  Completely denying  The fact that  This might have  Been a terrorist  Event that was  Pre-planned  And everything  And saying no  It's because of  That video that  Was put out  And now  They're like  Yeah it was  A terrorist event  And people were  Saying look  It was absolutely  A terrorist event  Libya was saying  Yes this was  A terrorist event  And the White House  Just kept saying  No  No it's  It's just the movie 
[03:16:00]  Don't worry  There's no solution  And then they got caught  There's no solution  No  I'll tell you  There's not  And it doesn't  Make a fucking difference  They're not in office  For you  They're not in office  For me  They're just  Yeah but can I  Like a fucking  Pilot fish  Like go alongside  And get some  Get a little  Nibble  Off of their thing  Even if they're there  Just for themselves  It trickles down  I like the trickle down  You like sticking  Your tongue out  I like being a little  Higher up on the trickle  I like being a little  Higher up on the trickle  You know what I don't like  I can't figure out a way 
[03:16:30]  Where you get to stop  When do you get to  Just stop working  When do you have  Like enough  Where I can be like  You know what  No matter what  The whole thing is so fucked  Like you work all week  And you get money  And it's just  It's just numbers  On a piece of paper  Then you give it to  These fucking assholes  You just give it to  These corrupt assholes  And then what  You put a thousand  In the bank  They can legally loan  Four grand off a thousand  They counterfeit three grand  Right off the fucking top  And it's just like  If you're like  Okay I'm not going to 
[03:17:00]  Put it in the stock market  I'll just put it in the bank  And then one day  You show up  And then the bank  Fucking foreclose  Whatever  It just closes  The only way to do it  Is you just have  A pile of money  And then you have to  Sit there with a shotgun  Ordering food  It's real estate  Ordering food  All fucking days  You become a tub of shit  And have a hot attack  There's no way  Like when can I just chill  When can I just have  The fucking lawn chair  I don't want  All I want is just  A fucking house  That it's paid for  And just be done  But then  Your gallbladder  Gets fucked up 
[03:17:30]  And it's going to cost you  Ninety grand  Just to get it checked  They fucking take  A big chunk away  You can't stop  You can't stop  It's miserably depressing  It's miserably depressing  I have a bit that I'm doing  About how you're never free  Your whole life  Should we get Troy Kwan in here  If you were to try it out  You want to try it out on Troy  Stand up and yell it at him  You fucking maniac  I think we need an update  From Troy Kwan  Can I say anything  You're not getting  Fucking attacked today  You're right Joe  You're right Joe  You're right  You're right  Jesus don't yell at us  Joe you're right  You need a birthday cake  You kind of ruined 
[03:18:00]  You ruined my morning  I wanted to come in here  I apologize  I wanted to come in  And have a good time  And I just  Anyway  I just wanted to  He said she said  Fucking horseshit  I wanted to speak  On what you were saying  Just don't yell at Joe  A bit about how  There's eight stages in life  And you're never free  Between work  Kids  Whatever it is  You're never free  And that  Just thinking about that  All the time  It makes me so depressed  I lay in bed at night  And I just think about  When is  It's never happening  You've got to just  Relinquish all care  You've just got to 
[03:18:30]  Not give a shit  What are you worried about Joe  What am I worried about  Why don't you just go  For a bike ride  And just kind of  Preferably  Not a high traffic area  Let those thoughts  Flow out of you  I live day to day  What stage is this  Day to day  I'm in grown up  You don't live day to day  You're hoarding fucking weapons  Well that's true  You're definitely thinking  That's why I can continue  Living day to day  No I genuinely enjoy  Shooting things  It's a pisser  But you know what  Shooting a gun is one of the great things in life  It's so much fun 
[03:19:00]  It's just so much fun to shoot  And to hit your target  It's wonderful  Sons of guns  Think about this  This is really what I think about  This is what Joe thinks about everyone  This is really depressing  Yeah  You realize how fragile your fucking life  After those shootings and all that stuff  Do you realize how fucking fragile your life really is  You're a fucking  It's hilarious  Jesus Christ  Sorry  No it's fine  I was trying to find something 
[03:19:30]  But it's so fucking fragile  So no matter what you do  Whether you worry about the stuff Bill's talking about  Whether you go out and make a shitload of money  Whether you're broke  None of it matters  Because you're just gonna be fucking dead  And that's what's so fucking scary to me  I'm an armed citizen Mr. DeRosa  I won't take that shit in a movie theater  I'll lay down some fucking fire  I'll lay down some fire  How many innocent people would have taken it to the back of the head  As you finally got that guy  Let me  This is the thing  This is the thing about that 
[03:20:00]  Where everybody goes  If everybody was allowed to carry a gun  We wouldn't need movies  You're right  We wouldn't make our own  Plow  Plow  Plow  I hear you  I know exactly what you're saying  Look everybody can get a driver's license  How many truly good drivers are out there  The amount of fucking people who can't drive  That's why I think the driving test should be more stringent  And so should be the gun thing  You should be a fucking Marxist  I honestly think you should  Before you just give somebody a goddamn gun  You should learn it  You should be able to be like that cowboy  Who pulls the gun out 
[03:20:30]  And two balloons pop  And it looks almost like simultaneously  Like it's fake  Yeah  Yeah before you can just walk into a theater  With a goddamn gun  Here's my take on the whole thing though  And I understand the thing of  Oh innocent bystanders  Who might have hit somebody  What's worse  Than a guy with a rifle  Shooting at a group of unarmed people  That can't get out the door  What could be worse than that  Nothing  A pedophile coaching a football team  Alright  David Tell  Levity live this weekend  I think if someone's actually shooting back 
[03:21:00]  At the bad guy  We're working together today  Regardless if he hits them or not  At least it distracts them to think  Wow  I'm being shot back at  Maybe I should  Not just  Stand here and shoot at the innocent people  Listen I'm not saying  That some citizens  Shouldn't be armed  It's like everybody  Shouldn't be a comedian  Uh huh  Joe DeRosa  Oh wow  That is  Wow  Joe you just take it  So goddamn serious  Just have fun  Can you just have some fun  My fun is done  Joe DeRosa  The fun's gone

[03:43:00]  I wanted to run in  Because  So really  What happened  Is the boys started  Some drama  Yeah where did they get  That information from  I don't know  Eric  You said yesterday  On my Twitter  Yeah  Oh so you  No I didn't say  She was drunk  I wrote to her  I said  Do you realize  You're writing to yourself  Yeah  She was complimenting herself  On her own Twitter  I felt  I felt  I felt compassion for you  Because then I looked on your  You know my aunt mentions  That you're attached to  And all our fans  Just start shitting on you  Yeah but that's pretty normal 
[03:43:30]  I mean your fans  Aren't always the sweetest  So what is it  Like a  Like a  Like a good looking girl  They get intimidated by  I mean I don't understand why  I know  One was my favorite  Don't worry  You're not that interesting  You uh  You  You fucking drunk  I think I got one of those  Well you are a drunk  But you're an interesting drunk  Yeah but I wasn't even drunk  Like if I'm drunk  Fine I'll own up to it  But I was not drunk  Today a little  I mean I see the eyelids  Are a little heavier  Than usual  Today I'm like  A little bit hungover  Yeah  But I'm not like

[03:44:30]  You're a friend of the show  I think  Yeah it's all in good fun  I think they were probably  Being protective of Opie  I guess  But you didn't really  Say anything about Opie  You were just like  I'm not drunk  Plus we didn't even  Talk about you on the show  I know  I don't know why  The boys said that  Maybe they  Maybe one of you  Walked in and asked  And then they assumed  That I was being talked about  Eric did you  Or Sal  Anybody know  If anybody asked  If Nicole was drunk yesterday  Uh not that I know  Cause then you walk in here  Yesterday on the after show  And try to clear your name  Didn't work  And we're talking about  Two dicks and a vagina  I know 
[03:45:00]  And Jessie Mae Pelusa  Pelusa is here  I liked her actually  She was great  She's gonna come back  On the show  When she can actually  Cause she was a little late  Cause it trains and stuff  But people were like  Who is this chick that's in  This whole show  She's a comic  I really thought she was cool  I thought she was super hot  I'd bang her  You would  Yeah I was attracted to her  You've had lesbian  A lesbian past  Have you ever hooked up  With just you and a girl  Without a guy involved  Yeah  How many times  Uh like a handful of times  Really in college  In college  And a little bit  In my early 20s  Um  God that sounds so weird 
[03:45:30]  I'm so old  In my early 20s  Um  When I first moved to the city  What inspired you  You would not just like  Making out with a bar  But going back to an apartment  And like  Drugs and alcohol  And that would lead to  Rug munching  Yeah  You went down on these girls  But I like it  I think women are beautiful  And it's fun  And um  You went down on them  I have  You enjoyed that  Yeah  That's incredible  I mean that  Just solidifies  Uh bisexuality  I think  Yeah  I mean I would never want 
[03:46:00]  To date a girl  I would never want  To be in a relationship  With a girl  But I can  Um  You're just DTF  You're just  You're just  In the fucking room  I really enjoy  Um  Spending time  With the ladies  In the bedroom though  That's amazing  What does your husband  Think of this  He loves it  Do you  Bring ladies home  For your husband  It might have happened  Once or twice  It did  Recently  Yeah  Cause you said before  That was my test  Cause you said before  Never  Because I  I didn't think  That he could handle it  And could he  We're married  And he's  You know  He's 
[03:46:30]  Um  He used to be  A womanizer  And I just felt like  If I brought a girl home  That that would send him  Back to his womanizing ways  But it's been okay  Did you bring a girl home  Since you've been married  Once  Once  How did it go  Amazing  Where'd you meet the girl  She's sort of a friend  Really  Yeah  And how does that relationship  Exist after  Fine  Great  Now were there moments  When Matt was  Do you say Matt  That's your husband's first name  I won't say his last name  When your husband  Matt  I didn't say Matt Ryan  Everyone knows who he is  He's not  He's not 
[03:47:00]  They do  He's not  He's not the NFL player though  People  Well let's say he is  Let's get some TMZ running  You know  We'll give you something  For the 411 to talk about  Um  Was he getting jealous  At points  Because you would concentrate  On the girl instead of him  No  He enjoyed watching  Yeah  Was there any points  Where you were like  Hey  You're concentrating on her  A little much  No  It was very  It was a  It was a very even playing field  Yeah  Really I  Good vibes all around  Good vibes  Yeah  Were there any rules set down  Uh  Yeah 
[03:47:30]  What were the rules  There will be no  Um  I don't  He can't sleep with the girl  What do you mean sleep  Penetrate  Is that what you're saying  Can she blow him  Yeah  But he can't penetrate her  No that cannot happen  Did he object to that at all  Or was he like  Listen  I got this far  No he understood  Why won't you let him  It's just  You know  It just feels like  It's wrong  But you didn't mind  Watching her do that  To your husband  No no no  That's fine  That's amazing  Yeah  That's very uh  Uh uh  Progressive of me 
[03:48:00]  Progressive  That's the word  It's very progressive of you  Do you get bummed out  That you can't have  These conversations  On the morning mashup  It seems like you have  A very interesting life  I do  That is just simply  Not taken advantage of  In your field  Yeah  Like you know  These are things  That we as broadcasters  Should be able to exploit  Our own lives  You know  I come in  But I talk bullshit stories  I'm like oh  I made Jess  You know  Save money on lunch  And you're like  Super uninteresting  Right  It's not an interesting thing  We have to really work  We have to really work  To make it interesting 
[03:48:30]  And you're sitting there going  Yeah sometimes I bring home  Girls for my husband  That's interesting  It's not going to become  Like a habit  How many times has it happened  Uh twice  The first time  Was it so successful  You were like  Was it the same girl  Both times  Yeah because it was  Like a comfort thing  And it's like  It's not easy to find  Some like someone  That you're both cool with  And you're both attracted to  How long have you  Known that girl for  A while  Okay  And she  Was it something  How did you approach her  Well she sort of  Approached us  Really  Yeah  And she said  Hey have you ever thought  About was she drunk 
[03:49:00]  At the time  Yeah  And you guys were drunk  There's always  Other substances  Involved  Yeah  Cause it's got  You gotta get a little crazy  You gotta loosen up  And uh  See for me  If somebody approached  First of all  They wouldn't  Because  Jess and I  Are only half  Of an attractive couple  Meaning that  Jess is attractive  And I'm not  So it wouldn't happen  In general  But  If it did  I would have to  Just wait  And look at Jess  Like if a girl  Cause a girl  Would be like  Hey have you ever  Thought about it  I'd be like  Yeah  And Jess would be like 
[03:49:30]  No  What  No  And then I'd have to  Explain that  I know  So you kind of  Just have to look at Jess  And be like  What are you  I mean  We down  And Jess would be like  No that's not cool  And I'd be like  Exactly  That's so not cool  Because it's  It's an awkward thing  I really want to sit  And talk to you  I can sit  Like I'm  I'm so like  Deliciously cozy  Here in this chair  You're loving this  The dog is asleep  Your puppy is asleep  Which is good  Cause I wouldn't want  Your little dog  To hear the stories  That his mother tells  The dog saw  Oh was the dog in the room 
[03:50:00]  While the three way  Was going on  Are you joking  Was it in your apartment  Yeah  Do you look at the bed  As a place where  Your marriage was soiled  It wasn't in the bed  Where was it  I'm glad I asked that question  It was in the family room  What  In what  Where in the family room  On the couch  Couch slash floor  Wow  You guys were wild  You went nuts  Yeah  Because you had just  Bought a new couch  Cause the old couch  Was so full of jazz  Totally full of jazz  If I remember correctly  I hate you Sam  I really do  So all over the couch 
[03:50:30]  And on the floor  And everything  Yeah  My god  So who do you think  Of the three  Left the most satisfied  There was you  There was your husband  And then there was  The other girl  Uh  I don't know  And was the other girl  Sitting there like  I would like something  To penetrate me  This is not cool  No she got that  She was totally cool with that  I took care of her  Yeah she didn't  There was no need for  So what was going on  When he was penetrating you  Who was taking care  Of your friend  I mean do you really  Need the breakdown  I mean it's an interest  It's just something  I'm curious about  I have a flight 
[03:51:00]  To catch to Miami  You are going to Miami  Aren't you  Are you bringing the girl  No  It might get there  No that's not happening  I got one waiting down there  You got a girl  Waiting in Miami  No I don't  What if Matt was like  You know we did this once  Like what if we meet  Someone in a bar  Or something  It's always on my terms  If it's not okay with me  Then it's not gonna happen  Like period  So he can you know  Beg all day long  But you've literally  Been married for  Three months  And it's happened twice  Yeah but he  But we've talked  I mean we've been together  For a long time 
[03:51:30]  And it's been  It's been a topic of discussion  Something that we've explored  And talked about  Because I would imagine  Because if that were  If Jess had the same experiences  That you do  She does not  But if she did  I'd be like  Jess it's something  That you enjoy  Something that I enjoy  Why not enjoy it together  As a couple  As a couple  It's a fun activity  What a fun activity  Now would your husband  Be upset if he found out  That you had spoken  In detail about this  On the radio  I don't think he'd be thrilled  Really  Yeah  Because I would think  This would be a sense  Of pride for him  But he's not a public figure  Either  No  Should we call him 
[03:52:00]  No we're not gonna call him  No don't get him all excited  Because he'd be mad  If I was on your show  Right now  Because I'm supposed  To be doing my work  Because he's picking me up  In a half hour  So I have to go  Okay go do your work  But I love you  Well no I love you  And I appreciate you  Being so open with us  Always  Always  Always  And remember  When you're sitting there  In that coffin  What I call the morning mashup  And you're sitting there  And you're going  I have so much to offer  But I can't say any of it  I'm pretending to be friendly  I don't like any of these people  I don't like any of the people  Calling in  They're all dorks 
[03:52:30]  Yeah  I don't like my co-hosts  They're nerd-oramas  Total nerd-oramas  You can always come in here  And be like  I have got to tell you  And an audience this  This is like my safe place  Yes  This is your safe place  Always realize that  It's like the trust tree  Right  Because based on the tweets  And everything that happened yesterday  I didn't want you to think  That this was not a safe place  No it was all in good fun  I just  You know  It was miscommunication  And Stan obviously  Tried to start some drama  And uh  Well Stan  Orange Syracuse  Stan retweeted my  iPhone video so  Okay I'll go retweet it 
[03:53:00]  Right now  Do that  Alright  Mashup Nicole on Twitter  Thank you Nicole  From the morning mashup  And uh  I hope you have a fun weekend  Oh I will  I have the picture  Of DeRosa and Troy  On my Instagram  At Rolando79  I did notice that Roland  I'm gonna let you get away  With that plug  Because it's relevant  To the show  Yeah it's for the show  As you were  As uh  Troy and Joe DeRosa  Skinny jeans  Versus skinny jeans  Was the greatest thing  I've ever seen  Yeah  Uh yeah you were  Documenting that fight  Like Ken Burns  Yeah well the fans  Were saying please 
[03:53:30]  What's going on  So I took the pictures  And posted it on my  Instagram and on Twitter  Rolando's 99  On both  Is on uh  Instagram  And he documented  The entire  Joe DeRosa  Troy Kwan  Uh whole  Back and forth  Debacle that went down  Shit got very real  This time  Yes  Joe was upset  I think  You know  And I  With good reason  And he was calling  Uh texted me saying  Oof what Troy said  Was tough  What went on  With Colin Quinn today  Eric you were in  The phone screening room  Yeah  What was  What was going on  With Colin Quinn 
[03:54:00]  Well when Colin  Called in  You guys were just  About wrapping up  With JBL  And uh  He said Twitter  Had been telling him  He has to call in  He has to call in  Because there's a  Fight going on  And he said  What's going on  So I said  You know Troy  And Joe DeRosa  Got into it again  Over their looks  And who's not funny  And  Wait wait wait  He said  Troy  Troy and Joe DeRosa  Have gotten into it  Over their looks  Over their looks  Well that's where  This whole thing started  Yeah but when you  When you phrase it like that  It sounds like Troy and Joe  Are just arguing over 
[03:54:30]  Who's more handsome  Well  Whatever  It is what it is  So  You know  Their looks  Who's more funny  Etc  And uh  Who was in the wrong with this  And Colin just  Bust out laughing  Said what a girl  And hung up  Well we had  I don't know  And then he called back  I guess a couple times  And he must have been  In weak signal area  Or he has AT&T  Yeah because  We had the worst  It was proclaimed  The worst Colin Quinn  Phoner ever  On the Opie and Anthony  Show today  Do we have that clip 
[03:55:00]  This is  Yes  Because Colin Quinn  And you ask any of us  Me  Eric  Travis  Roland  You ask any of us  Colin Quinn is easily  One of our favorite guests  On this show  I remember the days  Like at K-Rock  He would just show up  Unannounced  Like three days in a row  He'd be there before  We got there  And he's eating cereal  Reading the paper  And he stayed the whole show  Well that was when  He was  Into  It's just a weird  Mental place  And he was just  Writing and writing  All the time  And nobody knew 
[03:55:30]  What he was doing  And all of his  And he would  You know  He'd be up all night  He'd come into the show  He would talk about  His like  Piles and piles  Of writing that he has  That he just  Doesn't lead anywhere  And all that  Turned into  Long story short  Yeah and then  Louie was  On Broadway  Remember  Yeah  Louie did  But all that  All that work  Turned into his  One man show  Which ended up  On Broadway  And on HBO  And Colin used to  Also when he would  Be listening  If Jim or Bob Kelly  Said something  Yeah  He got to a point  Where he'd stop  Calling in  To call them out 
[03:56:00]  On their bullshit  He'd show up  And walk into the studio  And he goes  That's bullshit  And he'd start  Yelling at them  There's very few people  That can get away  With doing the  In studio call in  Colin Quinn did that  Yeah  Several times back then  Now this however  Was his worst appearance  On today's show  He called in  We didn't know  Where he was  We didn't know  Why he couldn't hear us  But this is it  The worst  Colin Quinn phoner  In Opie and Anthony  Show history  Colin  We did not hang up 
[03:56:30]  On you sir  What the hell  Your phone sucks  Yeah  You better get  An iPhone 5  Colin  Colin  Colin  Joe's been doing  Comedy for 11 years  Not quite  Just you know  A couple or whatever  This is the worst  Crashing of all time  I'm outside  I can barely hear you  Why are you outside  I like how he's acting  Like it's your fault  You got the studio  I know  You know where we are  Come by  Pick a bagel 
[03:57:00]  Yeah why don't you  Just come by  I'm going OTB  Where you going Colin  Oh my god  Jesus Christ  Oh screw it guys  Oh my god  Yeah  That's Colin Quinn  The worst  And right after that  They proclaimed it  The worst appearance  Of Colin Quinn ever  And I believe  That might have been  The best appearance  Of Nicole from  The Morning Mashup  Ever  On this show  What's up Roland  I have a cheap book  Autographed by  DeRose Ember 
[03:57:30]  Can we give it away  Is it out yet  I don't know if we're  Allowed to do that  We can give it away  And then when  When they're with  Lisa we'll just send it out  Okay 866-WOW1-WOW  And we'll have Bobby  Send it when he comes in  Yeah we'll have Bobby  Sign it  We're going to hold on to it  Until it's actually available  Because I don't think  We can give them away  Just yet  But  You got to call up  With something though  Don't call up  With some bullshit  And just be like  Oh I want a prize  Actually have something  You know what I mean  And if nothing  Nobody calls up  With anything good today  We hold on to it  And try again on Monday  I'm under no pressure  To actually give this book away 
[03:58:00]  You learn anything today Eric  The Troy Jotaroza thing  Kind of just  Let's bring in Troy  Took center stage  For all of this  Where is Troy  Troy he was a bit hurtful  Top to bottom  Today was a killer show  See  You had  Bill Burr  Jotaroza  And Dave Attell  In here  Who Dave Attell  Is just  Dave Attell  Maybe  The world's funniest man  Like there's just  He just  These lines  When he took the headphones  And tried to get them 
[03:58:30]  The jumper  I don't know what it is  David  There are very few people  That are funnier than Dave Attell  And I don't think  Anybody would argue that  But you had those three in  You had  JBL  Telling his  Harrowing stories  Of climbing mountains  This is a professional wrestler  Okay  Like for me  I think it's exciting  That he wrestled  In a cage match  But  He's  He's coming in here  And telling stories  Of  Swimming with great white sharks  Running with bulls  And climbing mountains  This is a man's man 
[03:59:00]  I mean Troy  I know you like  Outdoorsy stuff  But you  Even  You know  Even not as a wrestling fan  In terms of manness  You can't compete on JBL's level  No  I mean you wouldn't even want to  No  I don't know why any man would  I mean  That is where  The kind of  The benchmark has been set  For manhood  I would think  He can't compete  Don't  Jump  Just because Joe DeRosa  And him  Got into a thing today  Don't think you  Because he'll go after you  Troy's all fired up  Now is not the time  Did you hear Nicole in here  Yeah  Great today huh  Yeah  Really 
[03:59:30]  I like it when she opens up like that  Yeah  She wants to open up like that too  That shit with the dog scene  Probably would be like  What the fuck  The shit with the dog scene  Oh the dog she was holding  Yeah  Yeah she's a real sexual person  You can just tell  If that dog could talk  Yeah  Just imagine  Probably just had like a little whiskey  Inviting girls over  And banging them in the living room  With her husband  Ridiculous  That's great  I don't have that kind of life  I think she should let him dip in it though  Yeah I mean  That's like  Come on  You're going this far  That's kind of like  You can have a Sunday  But make sure they put whipped cream  On the side  He's going to eventually get to  Oh absolutely  This year 
[04:00:00]  I mean this calendar year  You know before December  It's October  You've got two months  Yeah  Well it's almost October  Don't remind me  They still haven't signed  Those contracts  To my knowledge  Bad news for us  Subway  Five dollar sandwiches  Yeah exactly  So  That's his plug  No I didn't  No he's making a joke  Yeah stupid  What I was going to say was  We had this after show  Which is going very well so far  Let's all be honest  You had all the comedians in  You had JBL  Who's set a new bar for manhood 
[04:00:30]  None of us can compete on his level  You had the iPhone audio  Which turned out better than even I thought  I mean I don't want to toot my own horn  But you can look at the video yourself  It was a good job  It turned out good  I filmed it too  Thank you  Roland  He went down and videoed it  And I wasn't sure about that  Because I didn't know if he could maintain  Like you think  All you have to do is point at me  And the person I'm talking to  And that's it  But with Roland  You just never know about those things  Right you know what you're going to get  I honestly  When I plugged the camera into the computer  To upload  I didn't know what I was going to get 
[04:01:00]  And that's why I didn't say  Hey I'm going to have a video  In a couple hours  Because I really didn't know  If there was going to be anything usable  But you did a great job Roland  Thank you  You did a great job  And you can see the YouTube video  Is on youtube.com  Slash not sam  It's also on our Facebook page  Facebook.com  Slash opian anthony  So definitely check that out  And send it to your friends  But Troy  Yep  I would say your segment  Was the show stealer today  Yeah it was fun  I mean you went in  Now this whole thing started  And I don't know if everybody at home 
[04:01:30]  Picked up on it  I  The whole thing started  Because I was surprised  That you hadn't let go of this thing  Because in July  It was July right Eric  Yeah July 27th  That's why we have an archivist  In July  You and DeRosa got into this fight  Because he kind of called you out  On you know  You thought your shoes were stupid  Or whatever  And you had a skateboard  Which by the way  The whole thing was a misunderstanding  Because that day  That you brought in a skateboard  That they were making fun of you for  Yeah  You didn't ride it in 
[04:02:00]  You were giving it away to a listener  Yeah  The whole thing was just a big misunderstanding  Right  And the clothes I was wearing  Weren't even that  I mean I wear some pretty stupid shit sometimes  Yeah  So that day  It was like  Just  It was wearing a t-shirt  Yeah  But it just got to an ugly place  So quick  Now in July  That thing  It kind of fizzled out  Within 25 minutes  20 minutes  Whatever it was  Yeah  And  Like two days ago  I was having a conversation  With Troy in the office  And he goes 
[04:02:30]  And he just kind of  Starts bringing up DeRosa  And I was like  What?  And he's like  Yeah  Like he just said  This is what Troy said to me  It wasn't personal attacking him or anything  Troy just goes  You know  I really  I have a lot of regret about  You know  My fight with DeRosa  In July  I was like  What do you mean?  Like you wish it hadn't happened?  He was like  No I really like  I've been thinking about it  I really wish I would have gone harder at him  And I was like  What?  Like you're thinking about that now?  Actively?  And he's like  Yeah dude  I don't know  I don't know  And this was Troy talking  And he goes  I don't know 
[04:03:00]  Something about what DeRosa did that day  Dude  He just rubs me the wrong way  I don't know dude  He just rubs me the wrong way  And I was like  You're still fired up about this  He was like  Dude  I am fired up  Yeah  And so I mean  DeRosa's coming in here  I gotta tell Opie  It's kind of my job isn't it?  I don't tell you how to do your job  Right  And then the whole thing  Just got ugly and exploded  Yeah  Is there anything that you said today  That you regret?  You did take shots at his career  We'll say  I'm not gonna use the word livelihood  Because it's been established 
[04:03:30]  That that is not an appropriate word to use  His career  And Joe was funny last night  He killed  Don't suck up to anyone  I'm not  He was shell shocked when he left  Poor Joe  So did  But did  Joe was at Caroline's last night?  Yeah  He was funny?  Yeah he was really good  I mean I've never seen Joe do stand up  I've heard him be funny on the show  I mean I've heard  Everybody loves him  I've heard good things about him  You saw him doing stand up  It wasn't your cup of tea  Yeah  Is there anything you regret about what you said today?  Well first of all  Somebody had sent me a link to something  From ONA 
[04:04:00]  I saw something  And then I saw  You know on the column  It had  It has other videos you can watch  And one was  You know  Joe DeRosa  Troy Kwan  Argument  So I hit it  And I was listening to it  Hang on one sec  I guess Anthony doesn't know the hotline  Anthony  No I have the hotline  Someone's not fucking picking it up  Who's working the phone?  It's uh  Juliano  Oh god  He's saying the hotline's not ringing  Fucking hung up on me  What?  Oh my god  It's Anthony  From the Open Anthony  She'll put me through  And then I hear him like  Not putting me 
[04:04:30]  Like on hold  Uh huh  And then I'm like  Dude don't fucking hang up on me  Korky hangs it up on me  What the fuck  Oh  A cock  None of these interns  You can't get  One of these interns is stealing your name  And is terrible on the air  And the other one is hanging up on you  They're waste  They're all fucking pieces of shit  They are  I hate the fucking interns  Horrible  I hate them  Oh my god  God damn  Yeah well fuck them  You can deal with them  At a later juncture  I will  I just wanted to add 
[04:05:00]  To um  The threesome  Story earlier  Yeah  Uh very  Very hot indeed  Yeah  But  Here's the deal  And Troy was saying  She should allow him to dip  You know  Cause she's got that one rule  What was it  That uh  He can't fuck the girl  Yeah her husband  Nicole from the morning mashup  Brought the girl home  And her husband  She won't let her husband  Penetrate her  Everything else is cool  Yeah  I laughed heartily  When I heard that  He has fucked her already 
[04:05:30]  Guaranteed  Is this  Cause we've all  Yeah this is based on  Complete experience  Believe me  Cause one of my favorite  Anthony stories ever  Is the story of  The wife gets in the shower  Oh and you just fuck  And you fuck while she's in the shower  Breaking the rules  Exactly  When you're having a threesome  And the chick is able to  Blow you and stuff like that  You don't think he's fucking  Here's what happens  Nicole  We've all seen Nicole  At parties and events  And stuff  And she does like to put him down  Oh yeah 
[04:06:00]  Guaranteed  The second she fucking  Shuts her eyes  By passing out  Her husband and that other one  Are fucking like  Around and on top of her body  Oh my god  So she's  She's passed out from boozing  And her husband is now just  Quiet  Quiet as a mouse  Fucking this other girl  Fucking the shit out of her  I can't tell you how many times  My passed out snoring wife  Was laying there  Fucking naked  Just sprawled on the floor  And I just was  Pounding away  On the girl 
[04:06:30]  That you know  You weren't supposed to  Pay as much attention to  Oh what a rude awakening  That's gonna be for Nicole  When she stirs awake one day  She doesn't know  It's happened already  It's already  He fucked her  All types of ways  Already  So it's done  You might as well  Just let him fuck  In front of you  I love that  That's awesome  Alright my friend  Take care of the fucking  They should all know  To fucking  Put me through  Anthony gets through 
[04:07:00]  Automatically  Assholes  Come on  Alright  Have a good weekend  Thank you  Have a great weekend  Yes  She's probably right too  Like Troy  You probably  I mean  Me, Eric and Roland  Are a bunch of  Fucking idiots  Like we haven't had  Any experience  Doing anything  In that experience  Would you say  That likely  That Nicole's husband  Has already fucked this girl  Quite possibly  Quite possibly  And if not  The talks have started  Of like  Alright I think  You should let me  Like you're comfortable  With it  Everything's good  Everything went okay  Right  Nothing got weird  I think it's about time  You let me fuck it 
[04:07:30]  I did twice already  So where do you  I was reading the phone screen  Is there anything you regret  No I mean  You know  Look  I was just fired up about it  You know  It's just kind of like  When you get going  It's just no holds barred  You know  There's just  There's no rules  In that context  It was what it was  Yeah  So I mean  Joe's a cool dude  You know  It's fine  It's over  Josh  Hey  Yeah  The first thing you're  Reminded me of  Was Danny Patrice  Like they got that  Uncomfortable  But you never really  Heard of that  Again after that  And so like  Today when 
[04:08:00]  Like Ope just  Kind of just  Got the fire poker out  I mean  Gee  That was  Yeah  I wonder  That was the last  Big sort of  Comedian staffer fight  It was Danny versus Patrice  I don't know where this ranks with that  I think we gotta give it some time  We gotta sit on it a little bit  I mean  Just the idea of fighting with Patrice  Is a lot more of a difficult thing  So that might rank higher  Yeah that's a rough one  But I don't know  I think we gotta give this time  And see where it lies  In the placement 
[04:08:30]  All I know is  I will be listening to the replay today  Of all people  I think it's squashed  It's fine  Everything's cool  I think you should make that  The weekend  Yeah I think it definitely  Will make the weekend  Make sure you're listening to that  Worst of the Week countdown  All weekend  My show will be back live  Sunday 4pm Eastern  Right here on this channel  And I'll get to  And go to YouTube  And my username's  NotSam  For the video  Of today's iPhone line  It's hilarious  Did you give me credit  That I filmed it  And it's on the Facebook page
