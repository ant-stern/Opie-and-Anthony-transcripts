<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly vulgar affair, marked by numerous tangents, on-air arguments, and a significant number of commercial reads.  The show opened with discussions about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight, featuring crude jokes from the hosts and Jim Norton.  This segued into broader conversations about obesity and societal perceptions of overweight individuals.  The sheer volume of commercial reads (at least 18 across different segments, with some read multiple times), caused significant disruption and frustration for the hosts, culminating in an on-air apology from SiriusXM employee Chuck Rose for errors in the advertising copy.  A video of a Zumba instructor charged with prostitution was shown, prompting further explicit commentary.

The Alexis Wright "Zumba Madam" scandal was a recurring theme, discussed at length with listener calls weighing in on their apparent apathy towards the misuse of taxpayer funds.  This was punctuated by more commercials, including suggestive Pajamagram reads.  The show then unexpectedly shifted to a discussion of viral videos, featuring a child's reaction to a train and a toddler's impressive basketball skills.  The segment concluded with a tense exchange between the hosts and their producer, Roland, concerning pressure to secure high-profile guests for upcoming events and general staff morale.  This tension extended to the interns, whose failure to deliver coffee and blueberries for Jimmy fueled further frustration and hyperbolic descriptions of the delay (over an hour).

The show continued with complaints about a "toxic" work environment and low staff morale, speculated to stem from previous unspecified meetings.  This then jumped to discussion of the Dollar Shave Club video, a Black History Month segment highlighting fire escape ladders, and further tangents including listener Twitter feedback about Jimmy's demeanor. A discussion with guest Joe DeRosa ensued, concerning DeRosa showing his girlfriend on another show, and this was further intertwined with a lengthy analysis of a clip of Robert De Niro becoming emotional in an interview, with a comparison to George Steinbrenner's emotional outburst.  More Dollar Shave Club commercials and profanity littered this section.

The Yankees' success and men's emotional responses, particularly the hosts' disapproval of older men crying,  was a prominent topic, transitioning to a reaction to the Robert De Niro clip and more live reads (including Stephen Singer Jewelers' ironic "I Hate Stephen Singer" tagline, Dollar Shave Club, PajamaGram, Vermont Teddy Bear, and ProFlowers).  A planned "gay off" with a male burlesque dancer spiraled into a bizarre sequence involving waxing staff member Sal with duct tape, culminating in a physical altercation between Sal and Troy, framed by the hosts as a necessary "bare-bottom spanking."  The show concluded with further discussion of the spanking, its justification,  additional live reads,  Ron Jeremy's recent health scare and recovery, and more promotion.

A post-show discussion involved Sam Roberts, E-Rock, and Troy, focusing on the day's events, particularly the "gay" themed humor and Sal's spanking.  Debate ensued regarding the prank's humor, sexual undertones, and Sal's comfort level.  The overall tension and "boiling point" of the show were discussed, attributing it to staff frustrations.  Listener calls commented on the show's "gay" nature, and promotions continued, along with a sarcastically ironic recorded apology from Rob Cross ("Chuck Roast").  Future prank ideas and bringing in female guests were discussed, along with the continued interest in the show from listener Luke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Never before has one radio show been so extreme...  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar...  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So...  Flashy. 
[00:00:30]  I've have a five-farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, alright, Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and balls.  This is good practice for Under the View.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and convention burns the crowd. 
[00:01:00]  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  He's cocked.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  That's why I can't even take fingers in my ass.  It makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  Ah, yes.  Yes.  Welcome to the Stephen Singer Pro Flowers  chocolate-covered strawberry teddy bear pajama show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  We were met with the news that we have 18 live reads today.  Jesus.  Busy week.  Strap in.  No.  No, it means a lot more than a busy week.  That's cray.  It's not the proper way to serve a client.  Serve.  At your service.  Valentine's Day. 
[00:02:30]  No, because if we took Monday off,  they just shoved all the live reads from Monday  into the rest of the week.  18 live reads is completely insane.  It doesn't help anybody.  Popular show.  I should have just had Sam Roberts come in on a Monday  and do them all.  18 reads.  That means...  I think.  At least 20 minutes of our show today  will be selling stuff.  At least.  We'll be selling stuff.  Why don't we just set up a stand,  like a lemonade stand,  outside of the studio here, 
[00:03:00]  and we'll just sell it there.  Oh, my God.  And it's going to be rapid fire.  It's going to be one after another.  You're going to do one.  I'm going to do one.  You're going to do another one.  I'm going to do another one.  And then good luck trying to figure it out out there.  Yeah.  But the dopey sales department thinks  that'll work for everybody.  Whatever.  That's not my expertise,  although I think I know a little more  than they do about that even.  So, Governor Christie.  You want to start with Governor Christie?  Governor. 
[00:03:30]  And I want to make it perfectly clear  I kind of like this guy.  I don't like many politicians,  but I kind of like this Governor Christie.  Look at how fucking fat he is.  He's fucking fat.  We're looking at some video right now.  We're going to play a clip for you.  The clip everyone is playing.  Yeah.  The guy is extremely fat.  There he is on the news.  Shut up.  It's a huge story today.  Governor Christie goes on Letterman  to have a little fun with his way.  There's the clip from Letterman.  What the fuck? 
[00:04:00]  Are they listening to us on CNN?  You see him sitting there with a giant bunt?  He has.  Look at the bunt on him.  He's got a massive bunt.  Oh, look at that bunt.  That looks like his pubic mound  is going up to his chest.  And it's almost impossible for this guy  to see his dick at this point.  I bet he doesn't see his dick.  He's obese.  Okay?  So he goes on Letterman  to have a little fun  with the fact that, you know,  Letterman's been doing the fat jokes.  A lot of people have been doing the fat jokes.  Yeah.  And at one point,  he pulls out a donut  and starts eating it.  Hilarious.  I'm like, all right.  Did he get a laugh?  He got a huge laugh. 
[00:04:30]  Huge.  It was great.  It was great TV.  Yeah.  And all that.  And then a doctor comes forward,  I guess,  yesterday from Arizona,  was there?  Yeah.  And basically says,  she's scared that this guy  will die in office  because he's so fucking obese.  So now Governor Christie  is losing his mind over this thing.  And it turns out,  this is the same doctor.  There's the doctor.  There's the doctor.  They're following right along with us.  Hold on.  To him,  I'm not going to comment on that, 
[00:05:00]  but I can only share with you  that that phone conversation,  when I think of it,  the words gracious and appreciative  do not come to mind.  Dr. Mariano says  she wants to see Christie.  Wait, so Christie called that doctor?  I guess.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  All right,  so there's a little update.  But that doctor who said what she said  helped out Clinton.  Richard Simmons is coming up  to talk about it, I guess.  Cotton candy hair.  Whatever's left of it.  Jesus Christ.  That's terrible. 
[00:05:30]  That's horrendous.  A guy that was never in shape  is going to tell everyone else  how to be in shape.  You know,  he was like the workout guru.  He lost weight.  Yeah.  But he was never in shape.  Never in shape.  Not a hint of a muscle in that guy.  No.  Anyway,  so the doctor that said  what she said about Governor Christie  helped out Clinton.  There was one muscle in him,  I'm sure.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm sure he didn't mind  a little meat gazing  every once in a while.  Yes,  in the gym.  Meat gazing.  That made me laugh 
[00:06:00]  all day yesterday.  Anyway,  so that same doctor  helped out Clinton,  you know,  and got him to,  you know,  change his ways.  Right.  Anyway,  Christie lost his shit  because his doctor  basically said,  you know,  I'm worried this guy's  going to die in office.  Yeah.  So do you have  the Christie clip?  Yeah,  it's like a news story  so they go back and say,  I hate this.  We can do the news story stuff.  Exactly.  That's fine,  now let's do this.  Also saying that she wants  to see him run for president 
[00:06:30]  but wants him to lose weight.  My 12-year-old son  come to me last night  and said,  Dad,  are you going to die?  I mean,  come on.  This is irresponsible stuff.  Pause.  We're going to pause a lot.  That's not irresponsible.  Irresponsible is not  taking care of your weight issue.  Yeah.  Because he's going to go on  and say,  look,  I'm a very healthy fat guy.  I'm sure you are.  But the odds are  it's going to,  you're going to,  your health is going to go  drastically downhill.  Yes.  Sooner than later.  Like Ant said,  just before the show, 
[00:07:00]  you do not see old fat people  walking around this earth.  No.  You just don't see it.  And then I piggybacked  that comment.  And you also don't see  old tall people.  Yeah.  Like really tall people.  Yeah.  Do you remember  Morgan Spurlock made that point  in Super Size Me  that people criticize smokers.  Like,  why are you doing that?  Right.  But no one ever criticizes  anybody who's eating  like addictively.  Right.  Because if people talk  to obese people like that,  it would probably,  you know,  I forget what his point was,  but he was right.  Well,  we'll say people don't smoke,  don't smoke.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  But he's obese.  And my point is,  he opened the door  to this criticism.  He went on and fooled around  with it on Letterman.  Then there's a doctor going,  well,  that's all well and good,  but guess what?  Yeah.  You know,  you're heading toward issues  if you continue being fat guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More than fat guy.  Like you said,  he's got a huge bunt.  He's,  he's,  he's,  he's a giant.  He's obese.  And he can't find a suit  at this point big enough  because even his big suits  are all tight.  Giant suits.  Do you know how much  people would love him  if he dropped like 50 
[00:08:00]  or 60 pounds  or like,  even though he'd still  be a fat guy,  but that would be so,  people would love him.  I was thinking  that perhaps  when he wants to make  a run for president,  if he can last fat  that long,  maybe a year,  a little more than a year  before the election,  he starts this weight loss,  Right.  which would completely  add to his campaign.  Oh God,  yeah.  In such a positive way.  People would be looking  at him all the time  thinking,  he's losing weight,  he's looking great,  look at this guy's  committed to something, 
[00:08:30]  and he's good  and doing it  and it would make him  America's fucking sweetheart  and help him  in a presidential,  he might be losing,  using his weight  to pick up voters.  Now you mean or then?  Starting now.  So yeah.  Starting now  and then in a couple of years  start that giant weight loss program  which would take a long time  at his weight,  but  Or he lap bands that shit.  Maybe.  It would make him look  so committed to something,  successful, 
[00:09:00]  he'd start looking good,  people would be like,  wow,  this is the guy we want.  Of course.  A lot of guys,  a lot of guys,  a lot of people like him,  man.  They want to lose some weight.  I'd love to interview him.  He'd be a fun guy  to talk to, man.  Hey,  like microphones,  can we have tissues  in here every morning?  I hate to sound  like a tissue diva,  but there is...  Tissue diva!  No, no, no,  you relax,  let me.  I mean,  I mean really?  At my station here,  I have my water,  I have my ice cubes,  I have my computer,  my phone,  my sound machine. 
[00:09:30]  How about we make  the new thing for Anthony  because his nose is stuffy?  How about some tissues?  You want to do a live read  right now?  For tissues?  We could do a live read  in the middle of our  Governor Christie break.  Do you want to?  I don't know.  I don't know how to do  18 live reads in one show.  That's ridiculous.  I'm going to rid my nose  of some snot.  Get some tissues  for Pissy Eyes over there.  If at any point  you want to do a live read,  it would be a big help.  I know.  Let me see the pile.  There's really 18.  Yeah,  I'm trying to sort them out 
[00:10:00]  into dividing them  so you're not repeating  too much.  Look at this.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  There's going to be  some repeats.  Just answer me  this question.  Did they fix  the Steve and Singer copy?  I just need to know.  It looks like they did.  Okay.  It looks like they did.  But two days later,  that's good.  I will say that  the fixed copy  is not yesterday's  fixed copy.  Of course not.  Meaning it's not just like...  It's fixed exactly 
[00:10:30]  how we said  they should fix it  because that's  the obvious way, right?  Yeah.  There's like an extra  two and a half sentences.  Of course.  Which was obvious  to everyone  except for the dummy  that was in charge.  All right.  Back to Governor Christie.  So the fat story.  Better.  Good.  Here it is.  Governor Christie.  Discussion by  even Christie himself.  On Monday,  appearing on  The Late Show  with David Letterman,  it came up again.  I've made jokes about you.  Not just one or two.  Not just ongoing  here and there. 
[00:11:00]  Intermittent.  And then,  to the surprise of many,  Christie pulls  a jelly donut  from his pocket  taking a big bite  and adding...  Hilarious.  I didn't know  this was going to be  this long.  Hilarious.  I'm a physician  more than a Democrat  or Republican  and I worry about  this man dying in office.  But in true Christie fashion,  the governor,  when asked about  the doctor's view,  weighed in  with the last word.  Weighed in.  If she wants  to get on a plane  and come here  to New Jersey  and ask me  if she wants  to examine me  and review  my medical history,  I'll have a conversation  with her about that.  Until that time,  she should shut up. 
[00:11:30]  What did I say?  I do like the fact  that he said shut up.  Oh, yeah.  Shut up.  He tells it like it is,  but I think he's  in denial a little bit,  don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah, he jokes about it.  Right.  And then he gets pissed  when people actually  talk about it  in a serious light.  The guy barely fit  in Letterman's chair.  Terrible.  And his whole bunt  was hanging over  the front of it.  Exactly. 
[00:12:00]  He describes his health  as remarkably good,  but did admit  that his doctor warns him  that his luck  is going to run out soon.  Thank you.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  That's how it works.  There's a lot of guys  out there that are  in pretty good shape,  but they're big guys.  And he describes  his health  as remarkably good.  It's remarkably good  for a fat guy.  Right.  Not remarkably good.  Yeah.  The fact that you're fat  makes it not remarkably good.  Right.  It's just... 
[00:12:30]  Like, I can't believe  you're alive.  It's like,  oh, that's remarkable.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, health is more than...  Your numbers are okay.  Right.  Could this guy run  a 10-minute mile?  Certainly not.  Exactly.  And that's not asking a lot.  Like, everybody in this room  is healthier than him.  But we're not remarkably healthy.  I would never call myself  remarkably healthy.  No.  Remarkable.  I tried to eat right  and exercise and all.  How is he saying  he's remarkably healthy?  I'm remarkably healthy.  Well, I'm healthy and remarkable. 
[00:13:00]  You're remarkable.  You're just plain remarkable.  Mar.  So he got mad  because the doctor  was pretty much...  I think the doctor  knows about obesity  and where that,  you know,  leads you.  Mm-hmm.  So, big story today.  I mean, it shouldn't stop you  from enjoying  Sherry's Berries,  but...  Sherry's Berries?  What's that about, Sam?  My God.  Oh, God.  It just ruins  the fucking flow  of a radio show. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, this is today's bitch.  You're right.  But it ruins the flow.  That means we got a break  every 20 minutes, I think,  to get them all in.  Well, unless you...  Unless you take long breaks  and you just want me  to keep throwing them at you.  Oh, my God.  I think we should do it that way.  Who thinks this is okay?  Sales.  Well, I did speak with Rob yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Chuck?  Chuck Rose.  And he was the one  that fucked up  the Steven Singer copy. 
[00:14:00]  And Radio Wizard  was out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know,  they just...  You have nothing to report.  I want to...  That's when I left  the studio yesterday.  I know.  I begged you to represent.  And you didn't call  or text me,  so I figured it was nonsense.  Yeah, it was nonsense.  And I wasn't going to call  or text you  because I figured  you would have  fucking reached out  if it was anything.  That copy...  The copy yesterday...  Today...  We got a solution on that.  But we don't usually like...  I was just like... 
[00:14:30]  It was like fucking  Tommy Lee Jones  in The Fugitive.  I don't care!  Right.  That's exactly how  I delivered the line.  Yeah, we don't care.  Just fix it.  And once I'm off the air...  Right.  I don't give a flying fuck  about what I talked about  on the air.  Anyone?  That's about anyone.  Well, he's trying to fix  everything before  next week  because he wants...  He's panicking  because he's getting  killed on the air.  He's like fucking...  He wants everything done.  He was talking to me.  He's like,  dude, what do I get 
[00:15:00]  that's like a sexy  Valentine's Day gift?  I'm like...  I don't know.  I mean, it's all in the gift.  Right, right.  And you know what's sexier  than the gift  of fresh, delicious berries?  Oh, what?  He just looked at me  with his dumb glasses  and his bald head.  Did he?  Yeah.  And his bald head.  He's like,  just fresh berries?  I'm like, no.  I'm like, no.  They're going to be  covered in chocolatey goodness.  Oh, where would he get that?  Well, I mean,  well, first of all,  for how long?  I mean, you know,  for one day only.  I said, Gary, look,  just send your lover,  whoever he or she may be,  Right.  A giant freshly dipped strawberries. 
[00:15:30]  Plus, get one dozen  assorted roses  for only $39.99.  Sound advice.  I got a question.  Sure, Oop.  Can we dip his bald head  in chocolatey goodness?  You sure can.  That would be good.  Yes, it would be like  a giant onion bulb.  Oh, Sherry's dumbbells.  Where the nuts  are on the inside.  When he said to me,  he said,  I'm not too sure  if I want to get plain old. 
[00:16:00]  I grabbed him  by a shirt collar.  Oh, you did.  And I threw him  against the wall angrily  and I said,  these enormous juicy berries  come dipped in white  milk chocolate  and dark chocolatey goodness.  Wow.  You zilch.  And they're topped  with chocolate chips  with fat decorative swizzle  or nuts.  I screamed that at him.  Good.  Pair with a classic  assortment of beautiful roses  in shades of red, yellow,  pink, and orange, Gary.  These are the perfect  Valentine's Day gifts.  For that special someone  in your life,  just use the code OPIE.  And when I said OPIE, 
[00:16:30]  I flicked under his neck.  Ow, ow.  I said use the code OPIE.  Ow, that must hurt.  When you order  to get that special offer.  Order today  for Valentine's Day delivery.  Here's the only way  to get this amazing  $19.99 Valentine's Day gift.  Call 866-866-FRUIT-02  or even better,  visit B-E-R-R-I-E-S.com,  berries.com.  Click on the microphone.  And when I said click,  I poked his chest  really hard. 
[00:17:00]  I said,  ow.  Click on the microphone  in the top right corner  and type in OPIE  under the neck.  Go to berries.com,  click on the microphone  and type in OPIE.  It's a delicious,  lovely deal.  And they really are good  because we eat them  in the studio.  Oh, we josh around  and have a ball here, guys.  But the berries  are phenomenal.  They are terrific,  Jim Norton.  That's how the conversation  went down?  It was really awkward,  yeah, because he's like,  why do you sound like  you're reading it but poorly?  And I'm like,  just shut up.  And I roughed him up  with a kiss.  He made love. 
[00:17:30]  Nice.  No news from Chuck Roast  yesterday, though?  Chuck Roast?  No, I didn't really  get anything out of anybody  once I left this studio  and spoke out in the hallway.  Yeah, they gotta leave us alone.  How'd your conversations go?  He talked to me as well.  Oh, okay.  Because he has to talk  to both of us, I guess.  I swear to you,  as I sit here,  I don't know what he did.  I don't know  what we talked about.  I know. 
[00:18:00]  I'm not even joking.  Dude, I know exactly  what you're saying.  I'm trying to think  what we talked about  between here and  the elevator.  There was another topic  that they talked to me about  and I can't even  fucking tell you  what it was.  I know about  the Reed thing.  That was one thing,  but that was quick.  And then there was  something else  and I can't tell you  what it is.  I really don't know.  Was it because you  weren't paying close attention?  I was being nice.  I'm actually really nice  when I leave the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're nice.  But in my head, 
[00:18:30]  all I'm thinking is  elevator, elevator, elevator,  elevator, elevator.  But it doesn't mean  I'm listening.  Yeah.  Right.  I tapped out of that shit  years ago.  You're just being cordial.  Yeah, I'm nice and stuff  and I nod a lot.  I know all the things  you're supposed to do.  Right.  Learned that a long time ago.  You nod and you throw  in weird words  every once in a while.  Like, oh, okay.  Sounds good.  Sounds good is another one  you throw in there  out of nowhere.  Sounds good.  No, cool.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  I'll do a mm-hmm.  Let's look into that. 
[00:19:00]  No, no, no.  No?  That gives too much info.  You don't want to look  into that?  No, no, never.  Because that's committal.  Because that means  there's going to be  another conversation.  Oh, fuck.  That's right.  With what he found out.  Oh, okay.  No looking into anything.  No.  It's a lot of mm-hmm.  It's all right.  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.  Ding.  Elevator's here.  Chuck Rost issued an apology?  Yeah, he felt really bad  about yesterday,  and so he wanted to...  For fucking up the  Steven Singer copy  for two straight days? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  His name was on it.  That was it.  He wanted to issue...  He heard Moe,  you know,  the radio show  we've been talking about,  and he said that he wanted  to issue an apology as well.  Oh, boy!  I, Chuck Rost,  would like to sincerely  apologize to Steven Singer,  the host of the Opie & Anthony show,  and its vast audience,  for failing to address  serious issues  with Steven's live copy  when it first came  to my attention  on the morning of February 5th.  I take very seriously  the needs and expectations  of our clients, 
[00:20:00]  sales staff,  and the professionals  whose job it is  to deliver these  valuable messages.  The account executives  who first receive the copy  and earn commission  on each and every spot  that their sole client places  on the platform's  biggest and most popular show,  expect better.  And I apologize.  The army of employees  in the SiriusXM traffic department,  whose job it is  to review client copy  as they cut and paste it  into email for distribution,  deserve better.  And I apologize.  The O&A staff,  all of whom receive, 
[00:20:30]  review,  and print client copy  each and every morning,  are incredibly busy.  There are only six of you.  You deserve better.  And I apologize.  To all involved,  the 12 to 14 people  who have the opportunity  to see copy  before it gets to the hosts,  but especially  to our biggest  and often only client,  Steven Singer,  I shamefully regret  my lack of urgent action.  I would like to take  this opportunity  to reaffirm  and redouble my efforts  to more aggressively 
[00:21:00]  seek out  and rectify the mistakes  of the many,  many,  many others  involved in the process.  I mean,  it's Eric's wife's account.  The commission on these spots  pay for his sweet  Simpsons memorabilia collection,  Harry Potter Lego sets,  his pro-wrestling  action figures,  and his crippling  hoagie addiction.  He runs the board,  knows which spots  are about to be read,  and he's the last line  of defense  before anything  goes out over the air.  He can't afford  to have his gravy train  derailed. 
[00:21:30]  Most likely,  if his Jeep  wouldn't have broken,  and if he weren't  too stupid to fix it  or call AAA  as soon as there  was a problem,  on the morning  of February 6th,  he would have caught  and corrected  this egregious air  well before the show.  In summation,  I wholeheartedly apologize  to our respected client,  Steven Singer,  for Eric's gross negligence.  It is my hope  that you will look past  his uselessness  and buffoonery  and continue to be  a valued part  of the O.B. and Anthony show  for years to come.  Thank you.  I didn't want 
[00:22:00]  to like that.  That's great.  That's great.  Damn.  He did the right thing.  He did do the right thing.  He did.  He apologized.  Accepted responsibility.  So he should be writing  or doing like  an actual radio show.  We figured him out already.  Yeah.  He's in the wrong  fucking line of work.  By the way,  to the other people  in management,  do you now understand  the value of coming  on the air?  No.  But that's  what you can do.  You can make it  into something.  Wow.  You can make it  into something.  But he's Chuck Roast.  Well, yeah.  Chuck Roast just takes,  you know, 
[00:22:30]  his whole thing  is to make mountains  out of molehills.  That was his slug line.  Mr. Electricity.  Chuck Roast  makes mountains  out of molehills.  Mr. Electricity?  Yeah.  Mr. Electricity.  That was funny.  Hey, who wants  to take this one?  I'm sure I'll have it.  On the old Twitter,  this guy.  Oh, boy.  What a surprise.  A dummy on Twitter.  Got it.  Why is his weight  your business?  He knows he needs  to lose weight.  Mind your own business.  He's the producer  for the show.  He made it,  Christy made it  everyone's business. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I thought  we were on the same  subject.  Yeah, Christy made  it his business.  Also, being a  public figure.  He's a massive  public figure that  looks like he's  going to run  for the presidency.  Right.  Then it is  everybody's business.  Of course it is.  If the leader  of the free world  has health problems,  then it's the free world.  He officially  doesn't have  health problems.  He's a healthy  fat guy.  I'm the leader  of Jersey.  He says.  That fucking  affects people. 
[00:23:30]  Look what happened  to Obama  in office.  He looks like  a completely  different guy.  Now you're  going to go  into office  as a fat guy  and assume  that you're  going to continue  being a healthy  fat guy?  He came in  looking all  svelte and  everything and  young and now  he looks like  an old pappy.  He looks beat up.  Oh my God.  Wow.  His skin even  looks kind of  grayish.  No, his hair  is absolutely gray  but even his skin  looks a little  unhealthy.  Can you believe that? 
[00:24:00]  So that's why,  idiot.  Wow.  Christie made it  everyone's business  when he took that  bite out of the  donut on Letterman.  That got people  talking and then  it got a doctor  who used to work  in the White House  saying she's worried  that this guy  could drop dead  in office.  That's why.  That's why we're  talking about it  today.  That fucking  presidency.  What a fucking  shitty job.  Did Bush get  gray or no?  Yeah.  Yeah, but then  what happens with  these presidents?  Then you gain a few  years back after you 
[00:24:30]  get out of office.  It's really strange.  Yeah, yeah.  You start looking  younger again for a  little bit.  Oh, he is.  Oh my God, yeah.  That happened  overnight with  fucking 9-11.  With Bush?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  He's a guy that  we said the other  day, he doesn't  want anything to do  with politics anymore.  No, he's loving life  now.  He's had it.  And then we got  another guy pissed  off.  No old fat people.  My co-driver is 72  and pushing 300 pounds.  I'm not saying it's... 
[00:25:00]  Why do people assume  when you say something  you mean every single  one of them?  We're talking about...  I'm going to start  a dummy page.  Please do.  I'm going to start  a dummy page for all  the idiots on Twitter.  What a fucking asshole.  Yeah, what we're  saying is I defy you  to ever find an  overweight old person.  It's impossible.  You'd never see it.  Do your own survey,  man, starting today.  Every time you see  an old person, 
[00:25:30]  only count the ones  that are really fat.  Yeah.  That number's going  to be extremely low  is our point.  Or Anthony's point.  That was Anthony's  thing.  People are stupid.  It's like saying  cigarettes don't cause  lung cancer because  I know a guy who did  not get lung cancer  and he smoked.  Right.  There you go.  So it must be.  Right.  I was trolling last  night on fucking  Twitter.  Oh, people are like,  oh, I guess Anthony's  bored.  I was hashtagging  pit bull. 
[00:26:00]  How did that work  out for you?  And I, well, I put,  I put these are  horrible animals.  And if you have one  and a child, they  should, a child should  be put in foster care  and you're a horrible  parent.  These are killer  animals.  And oh my God.  You're just trying to  annoy people.  Yeah.  Cause like people  love pit bulls.  Right.  Cause I was getting  pictures of puppies  and kittens and stuff  and people send little  pit bull puppy pictures,  pit bull puppy pictures  and they look adorable  and everything.  But I was like,  oh, they grow up  into killers.  So don't send me 
[00:26:30]  any of those pictures  of the future  killing machines.  Oh, did they get  angry?  Got a little angry,  did they?  Yeah.  People get,  people get very mad  when you insult  their, their pets.  This pit bull,  this pit bull discussion  is brought to you by  Proflowers.  What?  Huh?  Yeah.  What was the worst  person that got back  to you?  Oh, that I'm an  uneducated dope who  ought to do some  research. 
[00:27:00]  And I said,  and then he suggested  I watch a pit bull,  some film on pit bulls  that is out there.  And I said,  it's all pit bull  owner propaganda and  lies.  Science has proven  they're killers.  People are getting  a little upset with  me.  Sometimes you just  cast the old troll  line out there.  It's just fun to  annoy people.  It is fun to  fucking, people get  so, like,  impassioned about  stuff that really  doesn't matter.  Yeah.  One person said,  I own a pit bull  and she is not 
[00:27:30]  aggressive.  Only that way,  if they are trained  to be, have you  ever owned a pet?  And Ant respond,  no, hashtag  time bomb.  Time bomb.  Time bomb.  It's just fun.  I love fucking  with people on  Twitter.  There's so many  fucking idiots on  there.  Dummies.  This is how stupid  they are.  You wrote,  if you want to  post cute puppy  pics, leave out  the pit bulls,  please, they  are murderous  dogs, blah,  blah, blah.  And then your  immediate next tweet  was, this should 
[00:28:00]  be good.  Yeah, yeah.  Right after it.  This should be  good.  Here it comes.  And of course,  that's it.  Yeah.  Should we do  another live read?  Yeah.

Because people think  if you're making  fun of a politician  that means you're  for the other side.  Exactly.  I'd like to kind of  try to make fun of  all of them if you 
[00:29:30]  can.  It really is crazy.  I think, here's my  question.  Smoking bad.  They're about the  same age, right?  Obama and Christie?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you say?  About?  Yeah.  Give or take a  couple years?  Uh-huh.  So whose health is  worse?  Obama, who looks  like he's in better  shape, looks like,  because I don't know  his numbers, than  Christie, but he  smokes?  Uh-huh.  Or Christie being  extremely overweight?  Hmm.  Who's at a higher  risk?  for an early 
[00:30:00]  death?  Um.  Ooh, that's tough.  That is tough.  You just don't fuck.  Smokers end up  living a little longer  than...  I've seen old  smokers.  How many?  I'll see that,  because then that's  going to go against  what we were trying  to explain to that  other guy.  That just means...  Do you see a lot  of old smokers  walking around?  I kind of do.  I see every old  person smokes.  I kind of see  old smokers  walking around.  Every fucking old  person I see  smokes.  Wait a minute.  I think you see  more old smokers  walking around  than old fat  people.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  I think if  smoking...  I love how we do  our own fucking  fucking research  live for everybody.  I think if  smoking's going to  kill you,  it's going to do  it early.  Early?  Yes.  And I think if you  make it past a  certain point as a  smoker, you're  good.  You're good for a  while.  You're good.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And that's scientific  right there.  I think it is, too.  Years of studies.  16 live reads to go.  Everything I'm reading  has obesity leading 
[00:31:00]  to more doctor visits  than smoking.  Now, I don't know  about early death.  Well, now we got all  the health workers  checking in.  I've worked in  obesity care for  15 years.  This person is  fucking pissed.  Dar jar 14.  Jar jar?  Dar jar.  Oh.  Newsflash.  Me so working.  Ugh.  This is a newsflash,  and this is what I  was getting at,  but, you know,  it's not fair that  Christy said what he  said.  This guy or gal  writes, there are  no healthy obese  people. 
[00:31:30]  Higher cancer rates,  lower mortality,  et cetera.  Yeah, there you go.  Your numbers might  be good.  That's somebody that  works in the biz.  I hope J.J.  Abrams, like,  right after the  fucking Star Wars  scroll, just shows  Jar Jar Binks getting  his fucking head  blown off, and then  they just continue  with the movie.  Do you know what  a cheer that would  get?  Oh, it would be a  huge ovation in  the theater.  Does he have the  balls for the  serious Star Wars  fans?  Right, right,  right.  Oh, well, I'm sure  stupid George Lucas 
[00:32:00]  wouldn't allow it.  He doesn't have any  say in the matter  anymore.  He was going to  call.  He doesn't have  control of that.  Nope.  That's kind of like  when Michael Jackson  also owned the  Beatles.  Yeah.  Fucking Paul  McCartney, he was  basically told to  hit the fucking  bricks.  I own your shit  now.  That's what  happened, yeah.  So now, you know,  oh, Iraq, do you  have a comment on  this, Iraq?  Oh, no, just  it looked like you  were waving.  Because he can't,  he's so fat, he  has to move.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, sorry.  That was really,  he's like Gungan.  Lucas did just sell  two billion in  Disney stock that  they gave him.  He sold it?  Yeah.  Two billion in  stock.  He has nothing to  do with anything  Star Wars anymore.  Two billion in  Disney stock.  And they just  announced they're  doing standalone  Star Wars movies,  not part of the  neutrality.  It's a standalone  Disney movie.  Good.  I think there's so  much more you can  do with that  franchise.  But they're  going to do...  Lucas started doing  the same shit  over and over  again.  They're doing a  seven. 
[00:33:00]  They're doing a  seven, eight, nine  because it was  part of a book  series.  But they're also  going to do  like independent  Star Wars movies.  Believe me,  Disney knows how  to pump a  fucking franchise  out.  I think they've  promoted five  movies that are  on the table  right now.  This isn't like  one of these  deals with Lucas  where it's like,  I decide, you  know, 20 years  later I'm going  to fucking dip  back into the  well.  Disney's going to  pump these  fucking things out.  You're going to  see the Han Solo  story.  You're going to  see fucking  all kinds of  shit. 
[00:33:30]  How long is it  going to take  for the first  one to hit?  There's going to  be one movie  just called  Greedo.  It's just  going to be  about fucking  Greedo.  Episode  seven, I  think it's  2014.  2014.  What year  are we in?  2013.  All right,  we're getting  there.  JJ.  Fucking JJ  Abrams.  That'll be  fucking  righteous.  Friend of the  show.  We'll see if  he continues to  be friend of  the show.  Oh, man.  This guy's got  a lot on his  plate.  As massive as  it is.  He is a  massive fucking  guy.  Yeah.  Of course,  they'll do a  Boba Fett  standalone movie. 
[00:34:00]  It's just  going to  fucking  action figures,  Disney action  figures.  It's going to  be crazy.  The story's  about Luke  and Leia's  kids.  Oh.  It's your  kids, Luke  and Leia.  We've got to  do something  about your  kids.  What, do we  become total  assholes or  something?  What's wrong,  Jimmy?  This fucking  video of this  Zumba  instructor who's  being charged  with prostitution  in Maine?  Ooh.  Whoa.  You're liking  this story?  What is this,  Jimmy?  It's a huge 
[00:34:30]  story.  Do tell.  She's a Zumba  instructor in  Maine in a  real small town.  What the fuck  is Zumba?  It's like a  Latin dance and  a health thing  and she's being  charged with  over 100  counts of  prostitution.  Oh, man.  And there's a  fucking video of  her online that  the guy just  sent me of  her fucking  sucking on a  she's naked  and she's  fucking sucking  on a  like an  ice pop,  like a dick,  and she's  totally nude  and then she  pisses onto  a towel.  Where's the  video?  I don't know.  It's in my  email.  It's on  WorldStarHipHop.  Of course it is. 
[00:35:00]  It's so  fucking hot,  man.  I love  WorldStar.  God.  That's the  best thing.  You know  what?  Fuck the  peanut.  Fuck the  curtain rod.  Keychain.  Fuck the  keychain.  Fuck the  traffic light  shit.  The best  invention that  black people  have come up  with is  WorldStarHipHop.  Dude,  she just pees  onto a  fucking towel.  I guess the  guy requested  that.  Yeah?  Fuck.  And then does  she snap the  towel at him?  No.  And then there's  this little  mist of piss 
[00:35:30]  that comes off  of it?  No, it's a  webcam show.  Oh.  I'm fucking  turned on,  though, man.  Are you?  Look, you're  squirming in your  seat.  It's a close-up  of her vag just  tingling into a  towel.  Yeah?  I'd love to be  there.  Should we be  doing a live  read?  Did we change  topics here?  I don't know.  I want to see  this video,  though.  Of course we  do.  What?  No, that's  news footage.  Are you sure  it's on  WorldStar?  It said  WorldStarHipHop  on the thing.  Are you on  WorldStarHipHop?  No, he's not. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You're on  WorldStarUncut?  What?  Where are you?  WorldStarHipHop.  Oh.  Search WorldStarHipHop  for Zumba.  Jeezy!  Look for  prostitution.  Yeah, look for  prostitution.  You fuck.  That guy wrote  back on Twitter,  I would rather you  call the fucking  show.  Now he writes,  his physical  appearance doesn't  detract from his  ability to govern.  That's true.  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.  I can't listen to  what he's saying.  I'm too busy going  fatty, fatty, fatty, 
[00:36:30]  fatty, fatty.  I'm just filling  time while we find  the video.  There is a  preconceived notion  of fat people.  Fat guy.  Yeah, he could  govern as a fat guy,  but that's not  the point.  Whoa, fuck that.  What the fuck is  this?  All right, let's  see.  Oh my God,  what's she doing?  She's sucking  on an ice pop.  Sucking on an  ice pop.  Look at her  tits.  Dude, she's so  fucking juicy.  Look at her.  She's sucking an  orange ice pop on  her knees in a  video made at  home.  It's a cock.  Does she piss 
[00:37:00]  after this or  has she pissed  already?  No, after.  Believe me, you  don't think I'd  be yelling rewind?  That's true.  I want to see her  make wee-wees.  Yeah, me too.  Look at her ass.  Look at her  zumba ass and  her pussy hanging  down.  Wow, there's a  little meat  hanging down for  you.  Do you know  how much I  would have  spent with  her?  Jimmy likes  that.  Love.  Oh yeah, would  you have liked  to spend some  cash on her,  Jimmy?  Oh boy, what  is she doing?  She's going to  piss right there?  Now she's  rubbing her  nipple with  my ice pop.  She's rubbing  her nipples with  it.  Fuck. 
[00:37:30]  When does she  make wee-wee?  Fast forward a  little, Sam.  This is a good  video.  There's no  talking at  those, the  radio artist.  She's fucking  herself with  an ice pop.  That can't be  funny.  That's not her  audio, that's  Sam talking  right now.  She's very  excited.  She's eating  her own  juice.  How nice  is her  pussy?  You like  that movie  thing?  Yes, I  do a lot.  It's all  dragon.  Dragon.  It is  dragon.  I like  when they're  sitting there  and a part  of it just  hangs like  that character's  nose over 
[00:38:00]  the fence.  You like  Kilroy?  Yeah.  Kilroy is  here.  You want a  Kilroy pussy?  Yeah, I do.  Why fast  forward a  little bit?  Oh, because  you want to  see the piss?  I want to  hear what she  says first.  I'm touching  my nipples.  This is  great.  Jesus, Jimmy.  He's touching  his dick, too.  I know he is.  You don't have  to fucking point  out for everybody.  She is sexy.  The audience  even knows  this.  She's beautiful,  man.  She's a pretty  sexy girl.  Nice little  face there.  A little too  exotic for  Anthony Cumia, 
[00:38:30]  though.  No, no.  You know what?  It's really not.  She's right on  the limit.  Okay.  I'd be all  up inside that  shit.  I'd shoot a  tray up in  that piece.  Good for you.  Good for you.  She's almost  done with the  ice pop.  Yes.  That looks  delicious.  What's going  to happen when  she finishes  her ice pop?  You think  she'll go and  get another  one?  She can't  just have  one.  There's a  tongue depressor  for her  pussy.  All right.  She goes.  Where'd she go?  It's done.  Move that 
[00:39:00]  camera down.  What's she  doing?  Where'd she go?  I don't want to  see her lamp.  Oh.  Is she going to  make wee-wee now?  So what was  she?  A Zumba?  Zumba instructor  and hooker.  Look at her  nipples.  Oh, God.  She has big  nips.  Oh, here we  go.  Here we go.  Look at that  big pussy, man.  Oh, she's  fantastic.  She's squatting  over a towel.  Jesus.  It looks like  fucking...  There's too much  meat happening.  No, no.  There's something  happening there,  Jimmy. 
[00:39:30]  No, guys.  Oh, she's  making pee-pees?  Let's see.  Tinkle,  madam.  She's holding  the camera  and tingling.  Oh, I'd love  to hang out  with her.  She's trying  to set the  camera up  so she can...  Oh, why  waste it on  the towel?  Guys, these  are bodily  fluids, even  though it's  video.  How great  is she?  Is she going  pee-pee?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Let's watch. 
[00:40:00]  Make wet.  Let's watch  her make wet.  She's wet.  She's like me  in my bed.  So, wetsy-betsy.  Oh, look at that.  She's just  sleeping on  those sheets.  Oh, oh.  Look, she's  making...  Oh, I'm  peeing.  I'm squirting.  Would you  like her to  do that  on your face,  Jimmy?  Fuck.  Jimmy is 
[00:40:30]  so fucking  wound up  right now.  He just  goes,  he goes,  fuck.  I can tell  you there  wouldn't be  a drop  wasted.  Towel  shmowl.  I like that  because,  oh, I'm  peeing.  Yes, we  see.  She wouldn't  waste any.  I could lay  my head  on an  original copy  of the  Constitution  and it  wouldn't be  ruined.  That's  Jimmy's thing,  man.  But it's not  even something  I've been  into lately,  but just  seeing a  pretty girl  with a  nice  vag  doing it  is really  hot.  You don't  think that's  hot?  No, it's  sexy.  I don't 
[00:41:00]  want any  on me,  but it's  fun to  watch.  I don't  mind that.  There are  a lot of  videos of  her having  sex online.  Oh, I  want to  see one.  I'd love  to watch  her sucking  dick, man.  But it's  apparently a  huge case  in Maine.  So you'd  watch the  video while  you're  sucking  a dick?  Is that  what you're  saying?  No, I  think it's  not.  I'd love  to watch  her sucking  dick.  Let's  go to Joe  in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's  going on?  Hey, man.  This was a  huge scandal 
[00:41:30]  up there in  Maine.  It was a  real small  bedroom community.  She has a  ton of  videos of  her having  sex with  some of  her clients.  Most of  them were  pulled off,  but they're  on some of  these obscure  websites.  I've seen a  bunch of  them.  I'm sure  Jimmy knows  they could  get to  those websites.  Could  somebody send  me links to  some of her  videos?  I know I'm  going to get  a lot of  meat spin  links, but  I would  like to  see Alexis  Wright's  sex videos.  Good with  her dancing  too, naked  in her  little studio  there, and  dancing around  and on her  couch with  her ice pops. 
[00:42:00]  Dude, she  was, the  problem was  she was  taping her  clients without  their knowledge.  I don't know  if she was  blackmailing  anybody or  if that was  just for her  own safety,  but that's  why, guys,  you're crazy  if you go to  someone's place  nowadays, man.  I would never  do that.  No.  Just because  of the risk  of somebody  filming you.  Like I said,  a lot of  them were  pulled down  off the  internet, but  there's one  or two of  these obscure  sites that  all the  videos are  up there,  so you  can get  them, Sam.  Well, if  you send me  a link, I'd  do your  friend.  All right.  All right,  punch you  out, guys.  Thank you.  Probably should  do another  live read, 
[00:42:30]  because somebody  did the math  for us.  Yeah?  Your Twitter  name is too  easy if you  want Twitter  plugs.  He writes  one live  read every  13.3  minutes.  Oh, okay.  To get all  18 in, Sam.  That sounds  good.  Could he  put us on  the clock for  the rest of  the day?  Yeah, you  ready for one?  Yeah, let's  do one more.  It's your  turn.  I'd love to  marry the  Zumba girl.  Jimmy did  one, I  do.  Oh, boy.  This is a  round-robin  format.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  That video  was made in  the office.  She was  teaching  Zumba out  of...  Yeah?  That turns  me on so  much.  I don't  understand  what the  problem is.  Zumba  dances are  the best  bodies.  Rob  Schneider  married a  Zumba  instructor.  I think  she's  Mexican,  but she's  supposed to  be fucking  ridiculously hot.  Did you just  mention Rob  Schneider?  He's the only  person I've  ever heard of  who has a  Zumba  instructor.  A Zumba  chick?  Look at  his wife.  I'm in a  bad mood.  I don't  know, Rob.  Oh, she's  fucking  incredible as  well.  Yeah.

Here she is.  Ah, you found  one.  Holy shit, is she  sucking dick?  Yeah.  What is she doing  over there, Jimmy?  She's sucking a  prick.  Go to landscape  mode.  She's going to get  a load on her  face soon.  Hold on.  She's going to get a  load on her face  soon.  Hold on.  Turn that sideways.  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:00]  I guess the Zumba  thing didn't pay  well.  What happened  on the load, Jimmy?  I might have  zipped through it.  Oh, God damn  it.  Oh, boy.  She's blowing  someone.  All right, get  off there, volume.  All right.  Oh, man.  She's blowing a  guy with a very  average penis.  God, she's fantastic,  though.  She's doing a pretty  decent job there,  huh?  Oh, yeah.

Bam, bam, bam.  I can't take it.  Yeah, you're freaking  out?  Yeah.  Are you going to 
[00:46:00]  have to jack off?  Here's why.  Because she's legit.  What?  A hooker.  I don't mind a hooker,  but the fact that  she's a Zumba  instructor and  everybody in the  community knows her  and yet you can  pay to fuck her.  Dirty.  That dirty secret  is so hot to me.  Like dirty.  What would happen  if you did?  No, it's just  I'm teaching.  Can you control  being turned on  or will it get to  a point where  you're going to  lose your fucking  mind?  Yeah, I can.  You're going to  have to jack off?  No, no, no.  When will you  jerk off?  10.05. 
[00:46:30]  No, I'll just do  it when I get  home later or  tonight.  I can hold out  for a long time  actually.  People are  requesting EROC  does a live read.  How many have  we done so far?  That's right.  Eight, I think.  Ten more go.  I believe you've  done three.  That's it?  Yeah.  Sam's going to  do one, Eric.  So we haven't  even done.  I've got two to  do later.  Wait, we haven't  even done our  quota for the  first hour.  No.  No.  So we could have  just done them  during the break.  We're not making  any headway here.  We're not making  any headway here.  You've still got  five to do  during the break. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  This break?  We just did three.  You got five  per break.  So we could do  two?  No.  You've got five  left per break.  Holy shit.  You do three  breaks generally.  You have 15  reads left.  This is shutting  down the show.  You have 15  reads left.  Crazy.  This is more of  Jim's mud thing.  Can Eric do  one?  We're in the mud.  We're in the mud  today.  You know what?  They're going to be  standing out there  when we leave to  discuss about this.  Well, we're going to 
[00:47:30]  lighten up the load a  little bit on today.  And I'm just going to  be elevator, elevator,  elevator, elevator,  elevator, elevator,  car, car, elevator,  car, car, drive, drive.  Maybe we can make a deal  with them.  Yeah.  We won't bitch about  you today.  Just leave us the  fuck alone.  Let us walk out of  this fucking building  clear.  That's all we're  asking for today.  I like it.  You like that?  I like it.  That's not a bad  deal.  It's like a hostage  negotiation.  All right, look,  we'll walk out of  here.  Right.  We'll let the  five-year-old go.  Yeah.  Just let us walk  out of here clear. 
[00:48:00]  We won't talk about  you.  We won't bitch about  you.  And we'll walk out  of here.  But just don't talk  to us after the show.  Just walk away.  Don't talk to us  after the show to  try to justify your  jobs.  Right.  You got your job,  whatever it is.  We got our jobs.  Let's leave each  other alone.  The instructor's  doing a blowjob.  No kidding.  Quite frankly,  quite nicely.  Does she get  convicted yet or  is she still in  trouble?  Oh, I don't know.  I didn't even know  this story was 
[00:48:30]  happening.  Like, why is it's  amazing that our  fucking state money  is going towards it?  Who gives a fuck?  Who cares, right?  God almighty, all the  money we waste on just  being nudges to each  other?  Nudges.  Mind your business.  If people want to pay  her to fuck and suck  dick, that's their  business.  All right.  Well, now, now this  guy on Twitter, I'm  all about the Twitter  right now.  Brad Shaw, six, five.  Wait, sorry.  Let's start over.  Brad Shaw, six, two,  five, two, one. 
[00:49:00]  Just sent me a link to  the collected not safe  for work videos of  Alexis Wright, the main  Zumba Madam.  Oh, cool.  I got a whole  collection of videos.  Thank you.  A whole collection.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Oh, wait.  I think it's like a  montage.  A montage.  Holy fuck.  That's her dancing.  Is that her?  How's her body look?  She's dancing in her 
[00:49:30]  studio completely naked.  She was dancing.  Oh, my God.  She was begging to get  class.  She's doing Zumba  naked.  Oh, I would love to  take a class.  In the dance studio.  That's pretty fucking  hot right there.  I think that might even  be hotter than some of  the dirtier stuff.  That's pretty good.  No, it's not.  Why not?  That's pretty fucking  hot.  Her dancing is not  hotter than her  pissing and sucking  dick.  Well, it's up to the  individual.  That's pretty hot.  It is sexy, though.  Yeah.  Is it just one video?  I don't know. 
[00:50:00]  That's pretty good,  though.  That's pretty damn  good.  Thank you for that  like.  Dancing around naked,  but at some point  she's got to get to  fucking.  All right.  Should we take a  break there?  Yeah, let's take a  break, Ski.  We got a nice clip  after the break.  A very nice clip.  Nice.  Of an older  gentleman crying his  eyes out.  Yeah.  Pissy eyes.  Old pissy eyes.  An older gentleman.  Get the fuck  out of here.  An older gentleman  crying his eyes out 
[00:50:30]  after the break.  Is this embarrassing?  When you find out  who the older  gentleman is,  it's embarrassing.  It certainly is.  Should he have been  crying or is he wrong?  Did it sound  maudlin and stupid?  Good question.  I guess we'll all  make that decision  when we hear it.  That's right.  Before we go to  break, can I tell you  about something?  What?  What do you want  to talk about?  It's yours now.  This is like a  strategy game.  Look, if he does  his, then I do  mine now, too.  Aw, gee, Ant.  I ain't falling  for your shit today.

[00:52:30]  Let these people  out there relax  for a fucking second.  Paul in Maine,  what do you got, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, that's  Super Instruction  up there in Maine.  They've thrown out  46 of those cases  already.  The media's blowing  it way out of  fucking proportion.  I agree exactly  with Jimmy's head.  Who really gives a fuck?  They're wasting  tax million dollars.  Good.  Dollars.  She's wonderful.  Oh, she is for sure.  So you think  she should  be allowed  to just  suck cock  all over Maine? 
[00:53:00]  I mean,  what is it?  It's one of those  sleepy fucking,  what do they call them?  Oh, sleepy town.  Sleepy town.  So, yes.  She should just be  allowed to go  willy-nilly  peeing on everything  and sucking cock.  It's the sleepy  little Hamlet.  Politicians  are all in on it.  So why not?  I would imagine  she has some  high-profile clients.  Why did this story  what happened  where she got  caught?  Well, 
[00:53:30]  there was a lawyer  actually  who got caught  by his wife  and that started  the whole thing.  Whoops.  Yeah,  oops.  So,  she isn't  blackmailing anybody.  So I don't understand  what the fucking  big deal is.  Right.  Yeah,  she'll get off the hook.  I think it's the  I think it's the quantity.  It sounds like  there was a lot going on.  She's fucking everybody.  Seems like it.  Good for her.  Good girl.  All right,  Pauly.  Have a good one.  You too,  buddy.  Bye-bye.  Speaking of fantasies,

[00:55:30]  This is  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious next time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something  I think you'll understand  When I say that something  I wanna hold your hand  I wanna hold your hand 
[00:56:00]  I wanna hold your hand  Oh, please  Say to me  Let me be your man  And please  Say to me  49 years ago,  the Beatles arrived  in New York.  Let me hold your hand  Chris Rock was one years old  and Ashton Kutcher  was still coming  as dad's balls.  Wow.  I wanna hold your hand  On This Date  Brought to you by 
[00:56:30]  This Date in History  Fuck, man.  Yeah, the Beatles  What was that?  49 years ago today.  They landed there  at Kennedy Airport.  Was it Kennedy?  Or was it JFK?  What?  I mean, LaGuardia.  Idlewild.  No, it was Kennedy, right?  You sure it was Kennedy?  I thought it was Kennedy  by 64, right?  Yeah.  Yes, he was killed  in 63.  Was it 63?  Yeah, it was November 63. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, he was killed  in 63.  Maybe.  Kennedy, yeah.  And they,  who met him there?  Was it Murray the K?  Was it Cousin Brucie?  I think it was Scott Mew.  Was it Scott So?  Every DJ loves saying  they were the fifth Beatle.  Yeah, who was the real  fifth Beatle?  Pete Best.  I'm not answering it.  Pete Best.  Who was the guy?  Who was the guy  that was on the tarmac?  Billy Preston.  Billy Preston was there? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Well, why did he leave?  Who?  Pete Best?  Did they throw  Billy Preston out?  No, no.  He was just kind of  like the guy  that used to be in there.  Billy Preston was like,  later on,  he added some tracks.  Is he a black dude?  Keyboard.  Fuck, he's a black dude.  He had a lot of soul  about Billy Preston.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking about the Beatles.  Who was that other Beatle?  That was Stuart?  Yes.  Did he die?  Sutcliffe?  Did he die?  Yes, Stuart Sutcliffe.  What happened?  Rumor has it John Lennon killed him.  Some would say. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  Some conspiracy theories  that John Lennon killed him.  And then Payback met John Lennon.  They were good friends,  and some would say  they might have been...  A little closer than friends?  Sucking pedas or something.  Some conspiracy  that then there was  some kind of thing  that went down  and then...  A thing?  Lennon fucking hit him  over the head with something,  and he never recovered from that.  Where is he in that picture?  That's just one of the  conspiracy theories.  I don't think it's official  by any stretch of the imagination. 
[00:58:30]  And then Pete Best, of course,  before Ringo.  Did he leave or get thrown out?  Oh, boy, did they throw Pete Best out.  Did they throw him out?  Oh, yeah, they did.  What, he didn't fit the fucking...  You know, Ringo.  Yeah, Ringo had, I guess,  more of a personality,  and I looked to him.  But why'd they throw him out?  Did they just say,  hey, look, you don't look right?  Yeah, because they didn't  really need him.  I think he was an asshole.  I don't think he was an asshole.  No?  I don't think so.  They were kind of using him  because what do I know  about Pete Best?  Oh, you think Pete Best 
[00:59:00]  has that picture up  in his house everywhere?  Oh, my God, that picture.  One of these things  is not like the others.  How depressing.  They're all sitting there.  It's an early picture  of the Beatles,  how you know the Beatles  in the early days,  and there's Pete Best.  Is that George, Ringo?  I mean, George...  Oh, yeah, it is.  Wow, George, John Paul.  George and Pete Best.  Is he alive or dead?  He's alive.  We had him on.  That's right.  We had him on  a couple years back.  He was still very bitter.  Hate.  Remember he was trying  to promote something  and we're like, 
[00:59:30]  oh, my God.  Dude, he was the fucking...  It's by far the biggest band  to ever exist.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot.  They kind of used the guy  because he either had like...  His parents owned a club  or he had equipment  they didn't have.  It was something  that got him involved at first.  Could you help me out  with that, Sam?  There was a reason  they were using  Pete Best at first.  Poor Pete Best.  And then they met Ringo  and said, okay,  he can drum a little more  and he's got the look.  But then some say 
[01:00:00]  that Ringo wasn't  that great of a drummer  and that someone  might have went  into the studio  and kind of, you know,  fixed those tracks as well.  Yeah.  It says here,  like they had no permanent drummer  so McCartney was looking  for someone to fill,  I guess,  a Hamburg position.  They were doing  a Germany gig.  Hamburg!  And Best had been seen  playing with his own group  and it was noted  that he was a steady drummer  and he would play  the bass drum  on all four beats. 
[01:00:30]  All right, whatever.  He was a mean, moody,  magnificent by his female fans  and convinced McCartney  he would be good  for the group.  After the Blackjacks,  which was Pete's group,  broke up.  They're just as big  as the Beatles.  No, they really weren't.  Oh.  I mean, much to have to  pop, I fucked up.  My mistake!  I'm tired, I apologize.  McCartney convinced Best  to go to Hamburg  with the group.  He said he would earn  15 pounds a week each.  That's crazy.  Best passed his...  After 20 years,  that's in E-Rock.  See, 15 pounds a week. 
[01:01:00]  20 years,  do some math.  It's heavy.  You fucking got you there,  cocksucker.  Oh, shit!  As he passed his school exams,  unlike Lennon,  McCartney, and Harrison,  who had failed most of theirs,  he had the chance  to go to a teacher  training college,  but decided that  playing in Hamburg  would be a better career move.  Okay, good.  I was ready.  He had an audition  at the whatever club,  which was owned by someone,  and he traveled to Hamburg 
[01:01:30]  the next day.  Where did he travel?  To Hamburg.  What?  Hamburg!  I'm trying to think.  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm fast-forwarding here.  Oh, don't worry.  No, you got to do the...  Yeah, bing, bong, boom, boom.  Deedle, doodle.  Doodle, doodle.  Words.  Doodle, doodle, doodle.  Words.  She basses to herself.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, there we go.  Dismissal.  Don't go over.  I don't care. 
[01:02:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Deca Music  had turned down the gig.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  They had a recording session  at Adler Studios.  Women call me  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  One more time. 
[01:02:30]  No.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  We hate you.  I don't care.  We hate you.  When the group heard  that Martin and the engineers  preferred a session drummer  for their upcoming  recording sessions,  Lennon, McCartney,  and Harrison  considered the possibility  of dismissing Bess  from the group.  Eventually,  after a long delay,  they asked Brian Epstein  to dismiss Bess  from the band  while they couldn't  even do it.  Epstein agonized  about the decision.  As he wrote  his autobiography, 
[01:03:00]  he wasn't sure  about Martin,  who's an engineer,  I guess,  assessment of Bess  strumming  and was not anxious  to change the membership  of the Beatles  at a time  when they were  developing personalities.  I asked  the Beatles  You're not doing comedy,  you're aggravating the Beatles.  I asked the Beatles  to leave the group  as it was.  Epstein also asked  Bob Willard for advice,  to which Willard  replied that it was  not a good idea  as Bess was very popular  with the fans.  Ultimately,  Brian Epstein decided 
[01:03:30]  that if the group  was to remain happy,  Bess must go.  Because the group  wanted him out,  so it was the band  that actually wanted...  They wanted him out, huh?  Yeah,  but they didn't want to do it.  I'd rather hear a live read.  Bastards.  So Pete Bess  was summoned  by Brian Epstein  to his office  and he was dismissed  on August 16, 1962,  ten weeks and one day  after the first  recording session.  So he was technically  only a Beatle  for not that long.  Bess had been  with the group  for two years.  Oh, actually more  than I thought.  He was with them  for two years  and four days. 
[01:04:00]  Pete Bess's friend  was waiting for him  downstairs  in Epstein's record  shop after the meeting.  The two went  to the Grapes pub  in the same street  as the Cabin Club  where the group  often played.  You're kidding.  Well, I didn't realize  he was with the Beatles  for two years.  I guess he just...  Maybe he was just...  I didn't get that part.  Yeah.  Oh, let me go back  and start it.  No, no, no.  I used it.  Did you like my reading cake?  Yay! 
[01:04:30]  Hey, the video  that Anthony tweeted  last night  is all over the place  today on Fox News.  That's cute.  Is it cute?  It's adorable.  And she's getting  a train ride  for her third birthday.  Their father...  Where did they  let you do that?  I don't know  with Uncle Paul.  It's different.  What town is that?  It's just...  It's so damn adorable.  Can we see the video?  And it's like  I was saying  that there's no way  you ever get 
[01:05:00]  that type of excitement  in your life anymore.  I don't know.  We saw it with Jimmy  with that Zumba.  Yeah, exactly.  That's where it ends up.  Right.  Some guy tweeted  that I said  the excitement  because her face,  what she's saying  when the train comes by,  she just...  She loses her mind.  Right.  It's fucking adorable.  And I gotta say,  Anthony's really bad  at promoting his Twitter,  so I'll retweet his  on my Twitter,  which is Opie Radio.  Oh, we're gonna play it here.  No, no, we're not  because then they won't  go to my Twitter. 
[01:05:30]  No, but they won't be able  to see it.  No, no, no, no.  Put the sound up.  How many hours ago  did you tweet this fucking thing?  I don't know.  You were tweeting a lot yesterday.  I tweet a lot  because I was trolling.  Holy fuck.  That's because she's  by the tracks by her...  I know.  Her father's making sure.  This is a wonderful video.  It's adorable.  It really is.  The trains are coming.  What's coming?  A train!  Are we gonna ride the train?  Yeah.  Look at how it goes to us.  Oh my goodness. 
[01:06:00]  Oh my goodness.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Hey, we gotta be safe.  Stand back.  She's so excited.  Whoa.  I think she's a little scared  right there.  Alright, let's get on the train.  It's adorable. 
[01:06:30]  It really is adorable.  It's just mildly cute.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, I'm not.  Believe me.  Sorry she didn't pee  on a fucking towel.  Believe me.  You have a teeny-weeny heart.  No, I don't.  I'm a big-hearted guy.  Are you proving?  That was cute.  But it wasn't like she didn't.  You know, she just liked the train.  That's just it.  It's like that excitement.  Somebody tweeted yesterday  because I said,  you know,  you just don't get that kind of  excitement anymore as an adult.  And they said,  well, 
[01:07:00]  after my divorce,  after 20 years of marriage,  the first time I saw  a totally shaven pussy.  It was like that.  So that was her first train ride?  I think so, yeah.  Wow!  Yes!  The kid reminded me of Jimmy  going, wow.  Yeah, she's very cute.  Wow!  This is what I do  for the people today.  I just retweeted  Anthony's tweet.  Oh!  And we'll put it  on our Facebook page?  Sure.  Oh, right.  And then there's  the little baby  in the car seat.  Do you see him doing that?  No.  He wakes up to Gangnam Style? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I heard about that video.  I haven't clicked on it yet.  The kid's just totally asleep.  Yeah.  And there's some other songs playing.  Let me see that.  And the parents change it  to Gangnam Style.  Right.  And the kid out of nowhere  just gets up  and starts like kicking around  and fucking going bullshit.  That's cute.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Let's see this.  And the sister next to him  is just laughing her ass off.  It's a...  Let's see.  My...  The kid video...  That's a little girl.  I don't know who the fuck it is.  Shut up, fish.  Goldman Sachs is committed 
[01:08:00]  to helping women create  economic growth  in more prosperous communities.  Until they turn like  eight months old.  Exactly.  And look at that fucking  closely around the world.  What the hell is this, Sam?  Yeah, Sam.  Sam.  You know what?  I think we're 13 minutes in.  We gotta do another live read.  Oh, crap.  That guy did the math for us.  13.3 minutes.  We have to do a live read.  Man.  Every 13.3 minutes.  How long is this commercial?  I don't know.  Sam's fucking it all up.  Sam stinks.  Well, here at ABC, 
[01:08:30]  it's certainly no secret.  Why are you doing it this  and not just the video?  Can we just find it on YouTube?  Come on, Sam.  We can talk about these videos.  Fucking news version of...  We fucking are able  to comment ourselves.  What are you doing?  They're just gonna talk over it  and wreck it  and put the fucking ABC logo over it?  And just play like  a two-second...  Do the one that has  the most views.  Right.  You're fired.  All right.  A little different song  and now they changed it. 
[01:09:00]  That's hilarious.  Come on.  I forgot he is.  We're lazy today,  so we're not explaining  the measures.  The kid just loses him.  Oh, yeah.  He's basically sitting there  asleep with his eyes open  and he starts kicking. 
[01:09:30]  Well, we should have  a visual element.  Yes.  Fuck.  And the other kid's  laughing her ass off.  That's some funny shit.  That's really funny.  Yeah, it's very cute.  His eyes just open up  and he starts kicking and dancing.  Yeah.  The kid video I'm all about,  which most of us tweeted  two, three days ago,  I was telling Ant,  the news is this far behind  because they're going with it today.  Yep.  He started at 18 months  from 18 months old  to two years old  hitting all those basketball shots.  Mm-hmm.  You saw that this morning, 
[01:10:00]  right?  No.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it's little fuckers  just fucking lobbing the ball  into it.  And it's a kid basket,  but they moved it all the way up.  But there's one shot he does  on a seven-foot basket  in a gym.  Yeah.  He's not even two at the time.  Jeez.  That thing is going everywhere  as well today.  But that one is really visual,  so maybe we just throw it up  on the Facebook page.  Yeah, since no one can see  what we're doing.  What do you got,  the ESPN version  of that one there, Sam?  Yeah, maybe he could show it  on fucking Al Jazeera. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, Sam.  And then he does trick shots, too.  What?  And he's not even two.  Which 18-month-old is it?  Um, this one...  God.  It went viral.  You forgot something,  by the way.  Yeah, here it is.  Digital spy?  We're going to digital spy  for this one?  Yeah, this is the video, though.  Crying video.  Okay.  Grandma, kids never do  what you want 
[01:11:00]  in front of the camera.  Can you make a basket?  A basket?  Titus, make a basket  for Grandma.  I don't know.  No looks, Wish.  Whoa!  He's in...  That was when he was  18 months old.  And then they just show him  over and over again  with these fucking shots.  He's making them...  Yeah, he's just making them  into a little kid's hoop  all the way up  at the top of the stairs.  Yeah, he's throwing it up the stairs.  From the couch  all the way across the room,  he makes it.  Oh, my God.  And then at the arcade.  Then behind his back.  Jesus.  That's a weird... 
[01:11:30]  And then he bounces it off...  He bounces it off the wall,  makes it.  Down the stairs,  he makes it.  And he's white.  He's not even two.  Oh.  What is that?  Like,  that's just an amazing  vision  and way to calculate distance.  His form is unbelievable  for a kid this young.  Yeah, he goes right over his head  with both hands.  But he knows how to line it up  and calculate.  Yeah, he's making it  from on his back,  back to the arcade,  he's making them.  And then they show  a three-foot rim, 
[01:12:00]  he makes it.  A four-foot rim.  He makes it.  Wow.  Five-foot rim.  I mean,  there's trickery.  He obviously missed a lot.  Obviously,  they're not showing.  Yeah,  still six-foot rim.  You see in between shots,  he's got a black eye.  seven-foot rim  in the gym.  Wow.  That's weird.  It's fucked up, right?  He's going to be on  a whatever happened  two shows  30 years from now.  The basketball sensation  baby.  You know,  he's a fucking  real estate broker.  Not if he peaks 
[01:12:30]  at five-foot four.  But then,  this one,  I don't know,  it's hard to explain  all these shots.  He's making it  in the house.  But a lot of trick shots now.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  And then they line up  six balls.  He makes the first one.  There's no cuts here.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Second one he makes.  It's like the Goodfellas shot.  Third one.  Three in a row so far.  Yeah.  And the balls  are getting bigger.  Four in a row.  He's got the juice  behind those fucking shots.  Yeah, he does.  He throws that ball  pretty hard.  He kind of holds 
[01:13:00]  the ball back  over his head  and has like a very  even release  over his head.  It's amazing  how he's got  that mechanics down.  And now the seventh  ball in a row.  Wow, that's pretty good.  He went all the way  in a row.  What in your brain  enables you to make  that distance calculation?  I don't know.  Pretty good.  And then it just  keeps going on.  It's obviously  way too visual.  Yeah, it would be  nice to show people  and talk about it.  Yeah, that's some kind  of fucking wacky  hand-eye coordination.  Yeah, because he  has the ball  and he stretches  all the way  behind his head 
[01:13:30]  to get the strength.  It's probably the same thing  that's going to make him  kill small animals  and fucking hookers  later in life.  Yeah, he knows exactly  how much to swing them  by the tail  when they live  through the torture.  But it's weird  that there's a certain  what is it  that calculation  what coordination  do you have to have  to do that?  Coordination at that age  that's impressive.  Quite amazing.  Speaking of impressive.  Judging how hard  to throw it  or how far  it's amazing  how people can do  that for a living  much less when they're  four.  You can tell he has  really good form.  Yeah.  Speaking of form  what do we got?

[01:17:00]  Yes.  How about we get him  on this show?  Yeah.  Tell Roland  they're pushing for the Oscar.  Oh, no.  We got someone  from this movie.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Why are you saying,  oh, boy?  Well, I know.  I mean, I know what you...  I know who it was.  Who?  It was the woman nominated  for Best Supporting Actress.  Yeah.  We got a big star  from this movie.  A big star?  Okay, when?  I mean, it's just tough  for Jim to ask 
[01:17:30]  for Robert De Niro  and you to respond with that.  Why?  It's just like having  Robert De Niro.  Is it?  Well, she's on the phone.  Is she in studio?  She's on the phone.  Thanks for the reveal, too,  by the way.  Yeah, we didn't want  to tell her when it was Robert  until he started crying.  Good job.  You've still got a lot to learn.  Yep.  Good job.  RR at Radio Rookie.  You want some paper towel  for the behind your ears?  You could dab a little bit.  It's a little wet.  Yeah.  Ah, a little wet.  Well, if no towels are available,  you want to hand him that Glock? 
[01:18:00]  All right, let's see the video.  And people can't leave  the Pete Best shit alone.  No?  No, he was a bad studio drummer.  That was the biggest problem there.  I was in it.  Well, they needed him  to sound good  on the fucking records.  Sure.  Ringo was great.  What?  Supposedly he was a better  fucking studio drummer  than Pete Best.  Yes.  Roland, why can't we get him  in the studio?  They're pushing big  for the Oscar.  He's doing a lot of press.  Yeah, they're in London.  Do you want to find  a London and go  to the interview?  Oh! 
[01:18:30]  I think we should.  But what about like...  Well, Kate Couric's EP  is Jeff Zucker,  so they went to them.  Something about a cake?  No, Kate Couric.  Because he's saying  he's doing Letterman,  he's doing a lot of...  Yeah, TV.  Will he do radio?  Oh.  No.  Oh.  That's a fair question.  What if we just set up  a fake camera  made of cardboard in here?  Why are you biting my head off?  Tell him it's TV.  I'm just telling you the truth.  If you know,  De Niro,  what was the last radio interview  he has done?  Probably none.  Thank you.  But I mean,  why are you being... 
[01:19:00]  Whoa!  Come on.  I'm just asking you  why we can't get him,  not why can't you get him.  I'm just telling you,  he doesn't do radio.  And they are doing press  in London,  but they're doing phoners.  Whoa!  So why can't we get  a phoner from De Niro?  Well, the first phoner  they offered  was the woman  who was nominated  for Best Supporting Actress.  And I asked you guys  and nobody responded.  I responded.  Stop that.  You said,  I don't know.  Yeah, I said  we would talk about it today. 
[01:19:30]  I responded.  No, we went to De Niro.  I didn't know.  Yeah, I responded though.  I don't think we would  have a conversation  about it today  after the show.  I didn't ignore you.  Oh boy.  It started out  as a fun thing.  Yeah.  And now it's  very uncommon.  Just ask him  why we couldn't  get De Niro in.  Is it possible?  You feel that too?  I feel that too.  Sam, what do you  attribute this to?  You spend a lot of time  with Roland on the after show.  I think Roland's  very stressed right now.  About what?  It's obvious.  Why are you stressed?  You got your nose  in everyone's fucking business.  About what?  Yeah, why is he stressed?  Why is Roland stressed?  Why would he come in 
[01:20:00]  when I'm asking a genuine,  just a question,  hey, let's get De Niro  and come in  and be shitty to me?  Oh!  Shitty?  Just telling you no.  Just saying,  they told me this.  But we all understand  inflection  because we have  the commonality of language  and you understand  if I'm saying something to you,  if I said to you,  why don't we have De Niro?  That's a lot different  than going,  hey, can we get De Niro in?  I'd love to talk to De Niro.  They're both the same thing  but the way I'm saying them  is different.  So you understand  my inflection  is implying  what's behind  what I'm saying.  And I was just asking  and your response 
[01:20:30]  was not,  oh, well,  he's not doing radio right now.  He's over in London.  It was,  well, do you want to fly  to London to interview him?  Oh.  Sam,  you're a sniveling little shit.  Why is this going on?  Let Roland answer the question.  Oh, okay.  Still mad about the reveal.  Roland, comment?  Yeah, what's going on?  Nothing.  What?  Wow, you're in a really weird mood.  What's going on?  Oh, nothing.  De Niro's not doing press.  He is doing press.  He's right there.  Yeah, on TV.  But he's only doing  certain TV shows. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  That's it.  That's all his person said.  They said he made you  phoners,  but we don't know  until he tells them.  That's not until next week.  When's he coming back  from London?  He's going from London  to L.A.  to the Oscars.  Where's Sal's clip  when you need it?  It's going down.  It's going down.  There you go.  I'm not sitting next  to this cage.  Oh, shit. 
[01:21:30]  My jacket is gone.  You are really fucking close.  What?  Sam, comment?  Not for me.  No, huh?  Nope.  I think Roland's  the only person Sam fears.  What's the matter, Sam?  Why is Roland being this way?  Well, I don't know  specifically why.  I do know that  he's been stressed lately.  Why?  You got your ear  to the fucking street  here in this building.  What's going on?  In my nose in the shit.  Yeah, in your nose  in the shit.  What have you heard?  What's the scuttlebutt? 
[01:22:00]  My impression  is that Roland  is stressed  because people  are coming at him  from all ends  asking questions  about guests  and maybe he feels  that lately  it hasn't been as easy  to get guests  on the show.  Yeah, I responded no  to a bunch of people  I didn't want to talk to  but I also respond yes  to people I want to talk to.  But if I don't want to talk  to somebody,  I'm not going to feel guilty  because I don't want to talk  to somebody.  That's true.  I respond yes  to a tremendous amount  of people I'd love to talk to.  We've had this discussion  in the past.  This comes up every so often.  What's the problem, Roland?  Nothing. 
[01:22:30]  I try to tell you  over and over again  that they fucking love  the job you're doing.  So why are you stressing?  No, there are certain guests  that certain companies  present to Roland  to get on the show.  And see,  we're thinking more  in terms of the guest  and them actually sitting here  when Roland has to look  at a bigger picture.  We're just thinking  of the show and the guest  which is what we should think.  Roland's thinking  of the bigger picture  like, alright, Miramax  or, you know,  well, Miramax.  But, you know,  there's companies 
[01:23:00]  that are this, you know,  bunch of people  and we have to keep  the relationship with them  so we should take this guy  because he's in this stable  and, you know,  that way we might be able  to get that guy  or that guy.  But we don't, you know,  we're just thinking  what's best at that moment.  We're happy to do that  but most times  we've done that  it hasn't paid off.  Like, when we do,  we get the guests  and we do a good job  with them in most cases.  Where's Adam Sandler?  And he's just one example  of times we've done favors 
[01:23:30]  for these companies.  Weinstein Company  is very good to us  and we're good to them.  I mean, we take care  of their people  when they come in.  We took care of Harvey  when he came in.  He wrote,  thank you.  Harvey.  So, I mean,  it's...  Yeah, the other one  got fucked up  from the last Super Bowl  two Super Bowls ago.  But, I mean,  why can't they once  give us a big guest  and then go,  hey, as a favor afterwards  could you do that?  What happened  two Super Bowls ago?  We always have to  earn the guest.  What happened?  Well, because he got...  Because he did a lot  of serious stuff over there  and then when he said,  okay, I did all my serious stuff. 
[01:24:00]  He just got confused.  Oh, my God.  But nobody told him,  hey, there's other shows.  We've been...  His rep,  they should have told.  Hold on.  We've been on the radio.  This goes way,  way back,  way before you.  We've been doing radio,  you know,  18 and a half years,  this version.  We've had Adam Sandler on once  on a fucking phone.  Very, very busy man.  I'm not going to listen  to Adam Sandler excuses anymore.  He's had many, many  fucking opportunities  over the years  to be on our show  and has chosen not to be. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, he just doesn't  want to do the show.  Who dis on the telephone?  Right.  He just stops doing radio.  He just...  You know what?  Then fuck Adam Sandler.  Fuck Adam do one sports show.  Oh, whoa.  Well, fuck him.  Who gives a fuck?  You're burning that bridge.  Oh, really?  After 18 and a half years?  Fuck Adam Sandler.  Enough already.  Whoa!  I said yes to Jeremy Irons.  I would love to talk to him.  John Bernthal,  I said yes to him.  What about Jeremy Coppins?  I'm not saying that.  I apologize if I came at you,  but I'm not saying that.  But you came in here  in a really weird...  Yeah.  Well, what's something?  I would say bad mood. 
[01:25:00]  So why?  What's going on in your head today  as you walk down the hall  to come into the studio?  No, you know,  joys, flowers, chocolates.  Joy of being here.  No, but what is it?  Rolling for real?  What happens?  You're obviously in a really,  I would say, shitty mood.  So what's going on with you?  I don't know.  You have a bad night?  What's happening?  I'm fine.  And every time I have meetings  with important people around here,  they all say how you're doing  an amazing job.  Yeah, I'm fine. 
[01:25:30]  It just may be a bad morning.  Who knows?  No, it is a bad morning.  Why?  I don't know.  You don't know?  No.  No.  Look at Sam.  What's up, Sam?  Sam goes like,  just acknowledging.  Sam's like,  ooh, damn.  What do you think, Sam?  What's your opinion on it  since Roland won't say?  Are you mad that we've said  no to a bunch of guests lately?  No.  No, that's your choice.  I'm not mad at that.  Roland, let's do it.  I think, um...  We've also had a lot of  really good guests on the show.  I think a lot of people 
[01:26:00]  are giving Roland  some pressure,  some stress  about getting Oscar people  on the show.  And he presents them  and we've turned down a few.  Who have we turned down?  Oscar-wise.  Who have we turned down  Oscar-wise?  Nobody, yeah.  It's just money for...  We're going to see  if they're going to do funders.  Because Oscars...  I would say yes  to the mother  from Silver Lining Playbook.  Yeah, she's up for Oscar.  What about Ben Affleck? 
[01:26:30]  Ben Affleck is doing  tons of L.A. press.  L.A. press.  Law press, I call that.  Yeah, because  Rotten Tomatoes  flew out there  to interview him.  Oh.  Well, I'm a manual.  Right.  As far as the company's concerned,  the company has never once  used their pull as a company  to help us get anybody.  They've never once  used their power as a company  to help get anybody on our show.  They don't care  if people do our show or not.  If they're in the building, 
[01:27:00]  the company's happening.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, Roland has made all that happen,  not the company.  All right.  Bad mood Roland.  All right.  Bad mood Roland.  Don't get the panda angry!  Let it play out.  Is he mad at the lion? 
[01:27:30]  That's terrible.  Now that put everybody  in a bad mood.  I hate that pizza production.  You don't think it's good?  It's so fucking tacky.  It's kind of nice, isn't it?  It's put together like shit.  What?  It's nice.  It's a dumb voice.  It's a nice little thing, I think.  Oh, God.  All right, Roland.  Yeah.  Let's play the clip.  Yay.  Hey.  Hey.  Roland.  How's your iced coffee?  Delicious.  Ooh.  Iced coffee.  It's delicious. 
[01:28:00]  Good.  What the hell is that about?  Does anyone know?  Oh, my God.  He's so mad.  What?  What, though?  I don't know.  Why doesn't he explain?  I don't know.  Sam, come on.  You know everything around here.  Well, he...  You're the fucking company busybody.  He really...  He stresses...  Work stresses get to him more than...  But I try to tell him  he brings that stress on himself.  Yeah.  Me and him talk a lot  outside the show.  But, no.  He thinks, like...  I...  If you tell him that 
[01:28:30]  the bosses think  he's doing an amazing job,  shouldn't that relieve  some of the stress  that he's feeling?  No, because he probably  has personal goals.  But then he gets asked...  What's achieved.  You know, like,  why...  Or we should...  It's not even  why don't we.  Mm-hmm.  We'll get...  Like, we had a meeting  on Tuesday  where, like, the focus...  Tell us all about it.  In real time.  Yeah.  But the focus is  on making sure  we get topical guests.  Like, Grammys. 
[01:29:00]  Oscars.  And making sure  we're aware of, you know,  news stories  and people like that.  Sure.  And I think Roland  took that a little bit  as in...  As like you're not doing...  I'm not doing my job.  Oh, okay.  As opposed to...  Right.  Let's just address  this directive.  I hear ya.  Right, right, right.  Just don't pick it out  on me when I'm asking  for fucking Robert De Niro.  That was a fair thing  I asked.  He did, right?  Well, you asked  very obnoxiously  and nastily.  I was here.  I saw it.  Jimmy, you weren't  very...  Oh, my God.  I couldn't have... 
[01:29:30]  That was hilarious.  I was surprised  he even came in.  I wasn't even thinking  of him when I said that.  Yeah.  Very...  He was very angry.  I don't care.  I want De Niro  in studio.  We can't get him.  We can't get him.  Apparently,  it was very personal.  But he's doing...  I figure he's doing  a lot of press.  Maybe he'll do radio  because...  Jim, no, he's not!  During this Oscar push,  maybe they'll try to...  You know...  That's what he's doing.  He's pushing for an Oscar.  Are you motherfucking me?  Exactly.  That was kind of fucking... 
[01:30:00]  You want to fight in London?  Dude, that was kind of  uncomfortable.  I didn't feel uncomfortable.  I was just...  I was.  And Sam was fucking like...  You were almost backing  into the corner over there.  Because what happens  every time is he gets  frustrated with you guys  that he can't say  anything to you guys.  Oh, shit.  So he takes it out on me  because I'm in here.  Oh, shit.  But I thought we were  allowing him to speak his mind.  Of course, he can say  whatever he wants.  Why don't we play  the clip in question?  We can't now.  Why?  Because we have to do  more live reads.  Holy fuckaroni. 
[01:30:30]  I'm not even joking.  Holy mother of fuck.  We have ten to go.  Or nine.  I don't even know.  How many we got?  Nine.  Nine times.  So we're keeping up  the pace.  What?  We have an intern?  What happened?  I asked for something  an hour ago  and the intern hasn't got it.  Blowjob?  What was it?  Coffee and blueberries.  That's not...  I was at an hour  to get that shit.  That's not easy  to get, Manhattan.  Is it because  the store's closed?  He'll be back soon.  I know, but what took so long?  Where is he?  This place is  going to fucking explode today. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm feeling it.  I don't need to be there  in ten minutes,  but if it's 6.51,  I'm like,  can I have blueberries  and coffee?  And an hour later,  I don't have it.  I want to know  why the intern's not back.  My friend and I  would like some coffee  and cake.  How am I the happiest  person in the room today?  I'm not even unhappy.  First of all,  when I got the text,  I was out getting breakfast.  Oh, no.  So they weren't told  until I got back,  which was maybe  ten minutes or so later. 
[01:31:30]  Could you text them  or no?  Oh, boy.  No, I tell them  because I have to give them  the credit card  and your Starbucks card.  Well, then let them  just go with cash  and we'll reimburse them.  I don't care about that.  I'm going to give them some credit.  Yeah, the whole thing  comes to like a few bucks.  I just say you have to  give them cash.  I'll just hand them cash.  So they found out  ten minutes later.  So what did they do  after that?  Did they just go?  Well, one is out  getting Joe DeRosa's food  and another one  is getting your stuff.  So the one that's  getting my stuff,  I know he couldn't  be told until ten minutes,  but what took him  fifty minutes  to get blueberries 
[01:32:00]  and coffee?  Can he comment?  He has to walk  to the grocery store.  Where is it?  Queens?  Exactly.  I didn't say  go to Long Island  to King Cullen  and get me fucking blueberries.  What's going on today?  I don't know,  but I love it.  I'm fucking crying.  Oh my God.  Because Kenny looks pissed too.  Yeah, Kenny's not  in a good mood.  Why are you mad, Kenny?  Are you mad today too?  No, no, no.  Yes, that means you are.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  You guys know that there's...  We got two interns here.  I'm crying.  Look at my...  I'm crying.  Absolutely crying.  I really am, though.  Yeah.  What's going on, Sam?  It's a fucking hour  for them to do that.  Oh, E-Rock knows.  What's up?  E-Rock, comment.  He's just finished  watching your blueberries  in the kitchen.  He's coming down the hall.  Okay, fine,  but that's still over an hour.  Yeah, but now we have  a solution.  Now it's over.  Huh?  I don't think it was an hour.  I know you don't,  but I know when I sent the text  I have a fucking time stamp on it.  Okay, but I know when  we gave the information to him,  so I don't think...  Oh!  So somebody  delayed the order 
[01:33:00]  to the intern  in between the time  Jimmy sent the...  Nobody delayed it.  We were told  in the same process  like Kenny just explained.  So when we found out,  we sent the intern.  Why didn't you find out  right when Jimmy texted it?  Jimmy didn't text me.  I texted Kenny at 6.51.  And Kenny was doing  something else.  When Kenny was done,  he told me.  Oh, shit.  So what time did he tell you?  Z-Rock's blaming Kenny.  No, I'm not blaming Kenny.  What time did he tell you?  Yes, you are.  You just did.  You blamed Kenny.  I didn't blame Kenny.  Kenny, you better get back on Mike.  He's blaming you.  And why is Z-Rock  in a bad movie?  What time did Kenny tell you, 
[01:33:30]  I will take the blame.  I didn't blame Kenny at all.  What time did Kenny tell you,  E-Rock?  What is it?  E-Rock, why are you...  I'd say half an hour ago.  Maybe half an hour ago.  Why are you on your high horse, E-Rock?  I'm not,  because I don't think  anybody did anything wrong here.  So I was just explaining.  Hey, why are you on a high whale?  Wait, so you don't think  anyone did anything wrong?  No.  Okay, good.  So you think it should take  an hour to get blueberries  and coffee?  I don't think it took an hour, Jim.  I know you didn't,  but I'm saying  the whole process. 
[01:34:00]  What time did you send the text?  You have a timestamp.  6.51.  6.51.  It's an hour and six minutes.  Holy shit.  Okay.  That's crazy.  At this time in the morning,  there's long lines at Starbucks  because everybody's getting  their coffee in the morning  before they go to work.  Well, here comes the guy himself.  Here comes the blueberries.  Hey, how you doing there, fella?  Blueberry!  What happened?  Thank you.  What happened?  What are you celebrating?  What happened there?  Thanks.  An hour and...  Well, he only found out  a half hour ago.  Oh.  No, you're not allowed  to just ask them directly 
[01:34:30]  to get them.  No.  I don't care about  the credit card.  I'll just give them  fucking 10 bucks.  Oh, wait.  And he can't talk to them  directly because of Sal.  Wait, what happened with Sal?  This is so stupid.  What happened, Sam?  You rock.  So, obviously,  it's your fault.  No.  Because Kenny's not  allowed to talk to the guys.  How long from the time  you hear that  Jimmy needs  blueberries and coffee?  When did you find out  about getting blueberries?  Huh?  20 minutes ago.  20 minutes?  20 minutes? 
[01:35:00]  How was it 20 minutes ago?  How was it 20 minutes ago?  But the text was sent  an hour ago.  An hour?  An hour?  An hour and six minutes ago.  I was sitting over there  cutting draw-ups  and Sal just comes up to me about...  I don't know what a draw-up is.  Wait, Sal came to him.  Sal came to him  only recently,  20 minutes ago.  20 minutes.  There's a 45-minute delay  between the text  that was sent by Jimmy  and the guy  actually going to get him.  That's where the error is.  That's what...  Because we have two interns today.  It's not your fault, sir.  You can now... 
[01:35:30]  You're relieved of doing it.  You're good.  You're good.  You could go back to the barracks.  Sal.  Sal, comment.  Kenny came in.  He said,  this is what we need.  I took the order  immediately as soon as  Kenny gave it to me  and I presented it to the intern.  I said,  here's the Starbucks card  and here is the Amex card.  Shit.  That's exactly what happened.  But the credit card thing,  we don't need the credit.  Why not just give him...  How much was this thing?  Like eight bucks?  Six bucks?  Actually, it's $632.  Oh, that's where my estimation was wrong.  But I'll just give him cash.  If you're out,  you're out, 
[01:36:00]  I'll just give the guy  fucking ten bucks  and he'll get something.  Oh, shit.  So, Sal, who are you blaming?  Who do you blame?  I'm not blaming anybody.  I'm just telling you what I did.  Well, you have to blame somebody.  You know...  Because you're...  The order went in  over an hour ago.  No, I didn't know that.  Well, now you do.  Look.  Now I do.  The order went in  over an hour ago.  So, who do you blame?  The intern didn't leave.  I'm just kidding.  Kenny's pushing you out of the way.  Kenny?  I will take the blame  so you can move on  and do something entertaining.  Oh!  Whoa!  Let's talk about  Steven Singer, 
[01:36:30]  Sherry's Berries,  Pro Flowers.  Why is everything  so mad today?  And the weird thing,  there's nothing really going on.  We started off  all light and easy today.  Yes!  It's not today.  It's...  Sam!  Call them boiling point.  They do say  it comes out  over the dumbest thing, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  A boiling point  that I think  most of the staff is...  I didn't feel boiling.  I just want...  You know,  I'm fucking starving. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm...  Hey, I got your little blueberries.  I could use some coffee myself.  I think when this one  goes beyond  blueberries and Robert De Niro.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  It's two seconds.  He didn't get his coffee yet.  Hurry up.  Oh, shit.  He's pushing south.  I don't fucking do that.  That's not one of my things.  When it comes here,  it comes here.  But now you're saying that to me.  I don't want any problems.  But I'm not saying...  I'm not saying  it should be in two seconds.  I'm not being unreasonable.  I'm just saying  if the guy calls...  If I ask you,  why not just tell me,  hey, I'm out?  Let's...  Ask the guy yourself. 
[01:37:30]  I would have asked him myself.  By the way,  there's nothing better  that we could do right now.  Oh, please.  I completely understand that.  Do you want your coffee?  Whenever you can get a salad.  All right.  You know what that means.  I'm a reasonable person.  See you at 10 there, Seth.  Everybody's doing  the best they can.  Right?  Yeah.  But if you're always looking  to find the worst in people,  you're sure to find it.  Oh, wow.  That's unfortunate.  Did you just say that?  Yeah.  What is that? 
[01:38:00]  On your fucking daily affirmation  on your refrigerator?  I'm not looking  to find the worst in people.  The staff's not in a good place.  Why?  What happened?  Oh.  Is there a lot of stress?  A lot of tension?  Why?  What happened, Sam?  Sam, what's the overall picture?  We know this is just...  I'm going to officially  blame the Radio Wizard.  Are you going on record with that?  Yeah, because I bet you  there is...  This is what I'm going to guess,  and I swear I have no idea.  Something was said  in the meeting.  No, this is not a reflection 
[01:38:30]  of like this week.  Fair enough.  I think what's going on in here  is an overall vibe  that's just for some time  just been brewing,  and it's finally starting  to spill out with people in the air.  Sam, what do you know  about the bigger picture?  This is just a symptom  of the disease.  Yeah.  What's the disease?  Staff morale is very low.  Now, why would that be...  Why?  You guys just got raises.  Well, there's a...  I don't know.  It's...  There's a nastiness 
[01:39:00]  with the show  Yeah.  combined with the stresses  of management  that equates to a work environment  that over time  is not healthy.  Ah.  Toxic.  Right.  And nothing is ever done  to make that better.  It's just we mask symptoms.  We don't ever fix them.  There's no steam release valve there.  It just builds up  until the whole unit explodes.  Right.  And so the masking of the symptoms 
[01:39:30]  is starting to not work as well anymore.  So I was right.  We could blame the radio wizard.  You can...  I mean, your name's on the wall.  You can blame whoever you want.  Because if the guy is the guy  that's overseeing everything...  Right.  You know, and nothing gets done.  Obvious things that need to get done.  Then, yeah, you gotta blame him in the end.  Right.  And these blueberries  are fucking horrendous.  Are they?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You want us to go find more blueberries?  No.  Did he go to the same place  he always goes to?  It's just a bad back.  That's a fair question. 
[01:40:00]  Breaking news.  Same place.  Hold on.  Breaking news.  Oh, shit.  Fez took all the blueberries.  Oh, man.  Future Miss Curlin.  Check it in.  I have to read that Twitter again.  Fuck.  I mean, Colibia doesn't exist.  Oh, poor little fella.  They talked about me today.  All wrong.  Katie, did you see?  They talked about me.  So that's what happens.  I mean, as time goes on,  I think you guys will find  that if you start  pushing staff members  in ways that you normally would, 
[01:40:30]  breaking point comes a lot quicker.  But who's pushing staff members?  I asked a reasonable,  if it was 25 minutes,  I should shut the fuck up.  But an hour later,  I was like,  where is this stuff?  And then I asked about De Niro.  I wasn't yelling at Roland.  I wasn't saying,  hey, Roland,  get De Niro.  That's how you say it.  Roland's in a horrendous mood.  But I don't give a fuck.  Don't pick it out on me.  I don't fucking sleep.  Give a fuck  if people are in bad moods.  I get two hours  of fucking sleep a night.  Fuck everybody.  Holy shit. 
[01:41:00]  All our bad moods  fucking definitely  affect the people around us, though.  That's true.  That's true.  I mean,  this is not a person alive  that's not affected by that shit.  Yeah, we interact very close.  I understand that.  Right.  Put it like good rants.  But it's fucking...  Why is E-Rock in a bad mood?  That was the biggest surprise.  The symptoms are...  E-Rock,  why are you in a bad mood?  I'm okay.  Can you put a finger on it?  I'm okay.  I just,  I know  once we got the order,  we gave it the answer.  Sorry,  I stopped on that.  You gotta fully expect 
[01:41:30]  that one's coming.  You should always delay your answer.  Right.  You need to always delay your answer.  Lesson learned.  Because there's always a joke  after the question from someone,  and then we'll get the real answer.  God.  Yeah,  say E-Rock to you.  No,  I knew when we got the order,  we handed it off to the intern  and everything...  There's still a weird delay  that happened somewhere in there.  Kenny already accepted blame for that.  But it's not even about blame.  It's like,  he can't just,  he's not allowed to talk to the intern.  Yeah,  that's an odd thing right there.  And just text the intern  and say,  hey,  could you do this 
[01:42:00]  because I'm busy?  Yeah,  why,  you know,  wouldn't the Radio Wizard  at this point go,  okay,  there's obviously an issue with that,  so let me try to figure out  how to make that better?  Yeah,  this chain of command  who talks to who thing  is ridiculous.  People are suggesting  we fire Sam  and make everyone happy.  You could fire me if you want,  but...  Would you take a firing  just to get the staff  all on the right...  He's the only happy guy.  He feeds off negative energy.  I love it too.  I'm happy in this moment.  You ever see that episode  of Star Trek?  There was like a cloud  on the ship  and they got the Klingons 
[01:42:30]  and the Federation guys  together on one ship  and they were fighting.  Sure.  And this thing just got stronger  and stronger  because it fed off  of the violence  and anger  between the two people  and they actually,  in order to make it go away,  they had to sit there,  Klingons and fucking humans,  and laugh  and have a good time  and that thing fucking left  because it hated it.  That's you.  Thank God that'll never happen here.  Of course not.  Laughter?  Fuck no.  You know what,  everyone's talking  about the Dollar Shave Club video.  Oh. 
[01:43:00]  It's gone viral  with millions of views.  Now I'm in a bad mood.  Check it out  at dollarshaveclub.com.  Look for the guy  in the bear suit  and the toddler  shaving a guy's head.  There's the deal  with dollarshaveclub.com.  Everyone buys razor blades.  You're stuck  and brand name razor companies  know it.  That's why they build them  with ten blades,  a vibrating handle,  and a built-in back scratcher  so you end up overpaying  for shave technology  you don't need. 
[01:43:30]  Are they trying  to make it funny there?  That was a funny, right?  Yeah.  All guys want  is a great shave  without shelling out  $20 a month after  $20 month after month  for new cartridges.  What is this about?  I don't even know.  Are we talking about  a viral video,  a shave,  or what is this?  All the above.  It's a shave club.  Why are we going  to a viral video  to talk about a shave thing?  It became famous.  I'm so confused.  It became very famous,  this Dollar Shave Club,  because they put out  a video 
[01:44:00]  that became viral.  It's like Sam.  Well, good for them.  He talks about  things on his show,  but then he brings up  that viral video  just because he's proud of it.  But it's not fair to say  everyone's talking about  the Dollar Shave Club video.  I know a bunch of people.  Not one of them  is talking about it.  But I'm just saying  there's a better way  to sell this shit.  Do you know about  the Dollar Shave Club video?  I certainly do.  Thank you.  Liar.  Name one thing about it. 
[01:44:30]  A bear  shaving someone's head.  You sure?  With the toddler.  So,  guys shell out  $20 a month  after month  for new cartridges.  Stop wasting money  and go to  DollarShaveClub.com  today.  It's so simple.  You send them  a couple bucks a month  and they deliver  great quality razor blades  right to your door.  What?  It's a great idea.  It's a stupid idea.  No, it's fantastic.  You know how easy  it is to get razor blades?  They're expensive.  No, no, no.  Maybe you don't realize  Up and Neck Club is cool. 
[01:45:00]  Up and Neck.  You know,  you're sure it's cool?  Fantastic.  Golden Palace that you live in  but for us Joe Rose  who are still pitching many.  I've never had a problem  to get razors before.  You know what?  They're everywhere.  It costs $20.  You know what it is?  I have five fucking  drugstores in my neighborhood  alone.  They all have razor blades.  Convenience.  Convenience.  You'll be home  in your bathroom  going,  oh, I didn't go to the store  and pick up blades.  Now they're just being  delivered to your house.  It becomes something  that just is second nature.  They're always there  like the water in your faucet.  And you're not dropping  $25 a month.  Right. 
[01:45:30]  But the post office  doesn't even deliver  on Saturdays anymore.  What if you have to shave  on a Saturday?  Nobody shaves on a Saturday.  You don't have to shave  the minute you get it.  Right.  Yeah, but what if you need to shave  and now you've got to wait  for the mail to show up  for your blades?  You know, because you've already  gotten the blades beforehand.  Are you sure?  They'll deliver new ones  before you run out  of your old ones  just in time.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's interlocking  fields of razor blades.  It's fantastic.  Nine million YouTube viewers  wouldn't be wrong.  Nine million. 
[01:46:00]  That's more than I got  on my viral video.  Exactly.  So you send them  a couple bucks a month  and they deliver  great quality razor blades  right to your door  except Saturdays  because the post office  doesn't deliver on Saturdays.  Maybe they use UPS  or something.  You never run out.  No more nicking your face  with old blades.  I do that shit all the time.  You do?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  With these fucking bumps  on my neck.  Razor bumps.  You got the razor bumps?  I wish they were  fucking rope skids.  How dare you?  Because we forgot  to buy new ones.  Save a ton of cash  and never run out of blades  again with Dollar Shave Club. 
[01:46:30]  Go to dollarshaveclub.com.  Watch the video  and laugh hard.  That's dollarshaveclub.com.  Dollarshaveclub.com.  What?  We got something done here?  I was playing the part  of the guy that  uninformed consumer.  The guy that doesn't know  about him.  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  You were an uninformed consumer.  They should love this library.  Exactly.  I was asking the questions  that the average Joe  would be asking.  Asking.  And now they're all enlightened.  They're going like,  oh, okay, now I get it.  Just don't ask Roland  these questions.  Oh, boy.  I'll fucking strangle you.  I bet they'll love 
[01:47:00]  this library as much  as the staff loves  coming to work every day.  I'm sure we got  their money already.  Who cares?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  After Show still loves you guys.  Oh, they're an After Show  subscriber or sponsor.  Oh, yeah.  Black History Month.  We haven't gotten  a break officially, right?  Oh.  No, we've not.  Love a good Black History Month.  Or play the crying audio.  I know.  We've got to wait  until the next break.  Damn it.  We've got five more  live reads to do  this break along.  As soon as we come back,  we should play that.  We will.  We certainly will.  Definitely. 
[01:47:30]  Black History Month.  We're doing inventions  this year.  And Sam and the Who Kid  are doing an amazing job  with this.  And once again,  people are like,  stop.  These aren't real inventions.  They absolutely are.  They are.  I just want people to know  they really are.  Historical research is done.  Oh, that's nice.  In conjunction with the writing.  And people can look  this shit up themselves  to prove that it's real, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  This year,  to honor Black History Month,  the Opie and Anthony Show  recognizes some of the great  African-American inventors. 
[01:48:00]  Today, we honor J.W. Winters,  inventor of the fire escape ladder.  Darling.  Darling, wake up.  Wake up.  The house is on fire.  What?  Get out.  Through the fire escape.  Oh, okay.  Yo, what are y'all doing in here?  My wife just jumped out  the fire escape  and fell to her death.  That's some dumbass crackers, man.  Yo, climb out my window, man.  I'll attach the ladder  to that shit, man.  Wow.  That's amazing. 
[01:48:30]  I wish you had told me that  before my wife  accidentally killed herself.  Yeah.  She was a good fuck, though.  What?  The fire escape ladder.  Another African-American  contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month,  this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, they invented that  so, you know,  they could rob shit easier.  Oh!  Is that what happened?  It was just all of a sudden  people were climbing down them  during a fire going,  and this is great.  Right, but they're like...  We'll make believe  these will come in handy 
[01:49:00]  for fires,  but we can get into  apartments better.  I was puzzled when I read that  because I didn't understand  the use of a fire escape  without a fire escape ladder.  Yeah.  Seems like you just jump  and fall to your death.  Exactly.  As, like, the wife did.  The wife did.  The whole kid was very good in these.  It was great.  I'm really enjoying Twitter today,  and I'm sure that'll change,  and then I'll just have to  blow off Twitter for a couple hours.  That's what I do.  This guy, though,  Y-U-G-E-T-W-I-T-S.  writes,  Why are you in a bad mood?  The single easiest thing 
[01:49:30]  you could do  to put someone in a bad mood.  Ha, ha, true.  True that.  Yeah.  No one ever wants to care  why are you in a bad mood.  People are calling me a diva on Twitter.  Are you a diva, Jimmy?  No, I didn't think  I was being a diva.  I didn't say I snapped.  It sounded very reasonable.  Because we have two guys here.  That was my issue,  is that we have two interns here,  and there's something  in the system that's fucked up.  That's what the problem is.  Yeah, we have a lot of...  Yeah, yeah.  It's just silly.  There is something in the system 
[01:50:00]  that's fucked up.  And in the water.  Yeah.  Boy.  I don't know.  Yeah, a lot of people  saying Iraq sounds scared.  Iraq's upset.  Iraq is as mad as everybody else.  Iraq's upset.  A lot of people are picking up  that you're scared,  and you really should be saying  go fuck yourself  to many people around here.  Wow.  You just don't.  Iraq comment?  No, I'm fine.  Iraq is absolutely as upset  as Kenny and Roland are.  Are you, Iraq?  Not that I was aware of. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  That's an obnoxious answer.  Oh, yeah.  I just got the diva tweet.  Jimmy's a diva.  Jimmy diva.  Paul's shown that we can be a diva  in a little while.  And I know,  and believe me,  I know I can be a total cunt sometimes.  Oh.  But it was just,  it didn't make sense to me  that it took over an hour  for something.  That's all.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I got my coffee right away.  Now I'm embarrassed.  Look at Kenny's shit fucking. 
[01:51:00]  Thanks, Kenny,  and that guy.  I like this guy.  He don't want fucking airtime  or nothing.  He comes in,  delivers his shit,  and gets the fuck out.  I thought there were long lines  at Starbucks.  What happened?  I made my request five minutes ago.  A little fuel for the fire.  I guess everyone's at work  at eight o'clock.  Yeah, that must be it.  Yeah.  Not really.  Now we're going to go to break,  finally.  What is this?  All right,  what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem? 
[01:51:30]  The emperor is not happy  with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break  into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good  because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee  every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting  the savages  that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this? 
[01:52:00]  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not dying.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big  world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorists.  This  is the  OPNN3 show.  Sirius XM.  Oh, are you kidding me?  I'm eating. 
[01:52:30]  This is  this is insane.  A mouthful of food.  Hold on, man.  They hate when we eat on air.  We've been trying to  we've been trying to  eat the same stuff  for like  two breaks.  And I know the  idiots of  but  I do want to say  my eggs are really cold.  I got these two hours ago.  Cold eggs.  There are people  starving  just showing you that  we don't have a minute  to even eat 
[01:53:00]  with all these  live reads.  Want to know the secret  to a sexy Valentine's Day?  It's on the gift.  And what's sexier  than the gift  of fresh delicious berries  covered in  chocolatey  I can't say chocolatey  let's be honest  with each other  and chocolatey  goodness  I've tried for  three or four days.  I even practiced  at home.  I really did.  I cannot  I can't say chocolatey  Choc  Choc  Chocolately  I can't say  Chocolately 
[01:53:30]  I got it  Chocolately goodness  I can't say it  I admitted  to my fucking fault  alright?  Okay?

[02:02:30]  it's a fun  show to do  oh that's right  you were  I did it the  first night  they did TV  but I was  with him  and Nick  together  I haven't  done it  with just  Art yet  I would  like to  you hear  anything  about that  Nick  I don't  know  anything  no one  knows  a thing  so it must  be horrendous  somebody asked  me the other  day  somebody goes  do you know  what happened  I go  I don't know  what happened  I go  and neither  of those guys  are guys  I would walk  up to  and go  hey so  what happened  you're right  something bad  happened  do you know  anything  no  Nick indicated 
[02:03:00]  that when he  could talk  about things  he will  but he hasn't  he's been  very vague  and at the  cellar he's  just been  talking about  stand up  so I'm not  pushing him  on it  something happened  because Nick  really loves  doing radio  and he's very  good at it  so I don't  think he would  just walk  yeah  but I don't  want to  I know how  it is  you're afraid  that you know  you don't want  to mess  anything up  by talking  of course  yeah  but that's  interesting  to uh  to uh  I was gonna say  to see or  to see that  happen  but I would  love to know  what it was  I didn't even  know about it  until I got  the email  that said  do you want  to come  and do  the Artie 
[02:03:30]  Lang show  and I was  like oh  Artie's  doing a  second show  good for him  and then I  was like  oh no  that's at the  same time  that the  thing is amiss  yeah  so we got  uh  we have to  eat on there  because we  don't  we have so  many live reads  we have 18,000  reads a day  because of  valentine's day  coming up  how many have  we done so  far Sam  I think you  have five  left  that's it  that's not  bad  25 minutes  ahead of  schedule  longest married 
[02:04:00]  couple in  US history  how many  years  80 years  ago  oh  look at  this  oh god  devote  your time  to  understanding  one another  oh she  looks like  a bird  really  that's  the whole  thing  she's gotta be  pushing a hundred  they don't look  bad  he's spry  for 101  by the way  the guitars  have five  children  14 grandchildren  and 16  great grand  now that's  mr and mrs  happy  no they're not 
[02:04:30]  alright  let's move on  there are a thousand  reasons why people  are late to work  traffic is the  most common culprit  not all employees  blame  101 years old  they sound  good for being  that old  they sound  very together  they actually  look really  good  yeah  I think  Jesus Christ  it's about  understanding  the most  important thing  is listening  he must be like  I wanna  fucking  cave her head  in  every time  she talks  yeah  the most  important thing 
[02:05:00]  is that I  keep wet  snatch on the  fucking side  I'll bet you  when one of them  dies the other  one lasts  eight minutes  she died  he died  eight minutes  later  that's what  happens  I like those  fucking ducks  he gets to be a  bachelor for eight  minutes  yeah  he's been looking  forward to it  for years  I'm gonna have a  night on the  town  and get  he dies  with like a  black hooker's  feet in his mouth  he has a heart  attack  holy shit  oh boy  I'm hot today  he just wants 
[02:05:30]  to take a shit  without anyone  knocking on the  bathroom door  that's all he  wants to do  when she was  just fucking  preaching  and it's about  you know  living and  understanding  each other's  fuck you  just wants to  wrap his hands  around that  transparent neck  he's 101  she's probably  alive  so they've  been married  80 years  well back then  they might have  got married  21 or 15  I bet you  she's right  there 
[02:06:00]  maybe  you could get  married when  you were like  fucking 15  back then  I'm just  giving the  males usually  older  watch her be  30 years  older  she's 127  she robbed  the cradle  I used to  babysit him  and I noticed  he had a big  bulge in his  diners  but their  kids could be  let's just say  to be conservative  that she's 95  they could have  kids who are  75  their kids are  75  she's 97  she's 97  97 years old 
[02:06:30]  imagine having  fucking 75  year old kids  hi mommy  does it say  if they have  kids on there  they have 5  kids  and 16  great grandkids  and shit  that's a lot  I didn't hear it  you gotta listen  you gotta listen  if you're gonna do  a radio show  I didn't hear it  listen man  you gotta pay  attention  they gotta be  a few dead ones  what are their  age range  of their kids  that's fucking  I don't know  why that freaks me  out to think  that someone  is 75  is saying  hey mom  I heard they  have a 7  year old 
[02:07:00]  that'd be funny  oh my god  the one  you were the  surprise  68 years old  remember on  Golden Pond  when Henry Fonda  he turns 80  in the movie  it's his birthday  that's the  Norman  and he's talking  to the 13  year old kid  Billy  and he goes  you ought to  meet my parents  and Billy goes  your parents  are still alive  he goes  no but  you ought  to meet  him  it's pretty  funny  he was great 
[02:07:30]  in that movie  I've never  seen that movie  oh god  it's an amazing  movie  it's got  communist  Jane Fonda  in it  yes  and she  she's got  her father  and her mother  right  played by  Henry Fonda  and Catherine  first thing  they ever did  together  and I guess  he's getting  Alzheimer's  or something  he turns 80  and he's developing  a bit of his  memory is going  yeah  okay  on Golden Pond  it's the lake  they have  their little  place on  and it's a  whole relationship  between the  daughter  and the  father  you know 
[02:08:00]  it's like a  terms of endearment  kind of thing  it's great though  it's kind of a  coming of age  yeah  they go on a trip  to find a dead body  it's a coming of age  coming of old age  she's dating  Jane Fonda's the daughter  she's dating  Dabney Coleman  who's her boyfriend  a dentist  so they say  look we want to go  away to Europe  can we leave  his son with you  so they leave  their 13 year old  son Billy  with the Thayers  for the summer  and usually the Thayers  would go up there  and have their summer  on Golden Pond alone  but they say 
[02:08:30]  okay  so they do it  for their daughter  Chelsea  who plays the kid  anybody  no I forget his name  it was never  which is amazing  you sure  maybe we just don't know  I've looked him up  dude  he was in a movie  with Jane Fonda  he went into the  Henry Fonda  Danny from fucking  the Shining category  dude  it was a triple Oscar winner  and the little kid  from Close Encounters category  not much  they all just fell off  the face of the earth  and the kid from the toy  yeah  well that kid  wound up going into porno  I know  how great is that

[02:11:00]  married call  it's gotta be her idea  yeah it was  and she picks it out  and he's just going along  the only marriages  the only marriages  that last that long  is if the guy  is completely  fucking pussy whipped  and just shuts  his fucking yap  wait what year  is 80 years ago  yes  but I was gonna say  also the other way  it can work is  she shuts the fuck up  and he does whatever  he wants  because it's old school  when's that gonna happen  do you know what I mean  a woman shut her fucking mouth 
[02:11:30]  impossible  those people get married  in the 40s  anything she says  has to be annoying  at that point  oh what kind of coffee  would you like today  I wanna kill you  I wanna kill you  crystals  I wanna kill you  decaps  you fuck  give me a Sanka  and then throw yourself  down the cellar steps  do you realize  in 1953  they celebrated  their 20th winning anniversary  in 53  they were married  in 33  oh my god  god damn  that's crazy

[02:13:00]  so Bob comes out  and pushing him  and I said  you can't do that  you know  he said  but it's not like  I'm a raging bull  and it's freaking me out  and eventually he said  you know what  it's real  a kid  a teenage kid  if a grown man  with a bloody nose  in his pajamas  was pushing him  you know  might start to laugh  nervously  so let's play it  and that became  a very beautiful moment  in the film  where he says  I'm gonna come back here  I'm gonna break that camera  over your head  then I'm gonna come back  and interview  what it's like  to have that camera broken  what are you laughing at  I'm sorry  he immediately realizes  that he's out of control  but he gets to say 
[02:13:30]  what are you laughing at  and so he used it  you know  he taught us all  he taught us all  did you feel  a greater responsibility  Bob  doing a film  that David had so much  personally invested in  oh of course  I mean  I understand  what he  what's going on Bob  why is he crying  maybe that's why  he doesn't like interviews  what the f***  jesus 
[02:14:00]  I don't like  to get emotional  that's a rivet  that's a rivet  you can act like a man  what the matter  I'm using his own  fucking clip  against him  I see the awful  terrible things  in my life  and turn it into  something funny  could you go back  that's terrific 
[02:14:30]  that's terrific  mom  please  stop calling me  wow  he doesn't like  getting emotional  yeah  and the guy next to him  looks upset too  Bradley Cooper  went over silver lining  playbook  well it's obviously  something else  you saw it right  it's a good movie  I didn't watch it yet  I have the screener  I haven't watched it yet  I heard it was very good  it stunk  wasn't good  I thought it was pretty good  I'm a big David O'Russell fan  I really like I Heart Huckabees 
[02:15:00]  and Three Kings  how do you know these names  I never saw I Heart Huckabees  no the name  David O'Russell  he's been nominated for Academy Awards  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I'm sorry  you're right  you're more intelligent than me  you see the girl in Silver Lining Playbook  yeah  she's hot  and she's from Hunger Games  Jennifer Lawrence  she's sexy  this reminds me  it's got a lot of shit going on though  I would get some of those moles  oh I thought you meant to cleave it  those are breasts 
[02:15:30]  there's a lot of stuff though man  why is Danilo crying  is this probably something  with his own kid or something  alright we won't play any of those  like a fight  no I want to hear it  this reminds me  remember when Sinatra got the  Lifetime Achievement Award  in the Grammys  and he was like being spacey  and everybody was like  what the fuck is going on  this was the first time  anybody saw I cried out of it  and it was very like alarming  like what's happening  like was he okay  this reminds me of that  yeah this is uncomfortable to watch  let's see it though  I don't know  they make fun of it 
[02:16:00]  yeah  what happened Bob  oh my god  they got him tissues  oh Katie Couric  handing him tissues  I don't like to get emotional  but I know exactly  what he goes to  understood  but he knows what  exactly what he goes to  liar whore  liar whore  you know it  I wouldn't stop the clip  this is going great 
[02:16:30]  you're being more funny  fancy talk  fancy talk for a whore  oh no  oh boy  oh Bob  oh Bob  oh yeah  what happened Bob  alright let's give it a little  we're trying  let's hear more of this  you better go back again  yeah  go back a little  I gotta  please  go back a little 
[02:17:00]  I bet you something  happened with his own kid  you think  an argument or a fight  or something  yeah  it just brought it back for him  very sad  yeah  alright  let's hear a little  he understood  some of the same experiences  shut your god damn pie hole  clearly this became  an important  cathartic experience  for all of you  you know  a communal experience  oh fuck it  idiot 
[02:17:30]  you're gonna be okay  I'll bet you that  one of his kids  has a  it goes through that  people can call me  anything they want  as long as they don't  call me late  for supper  for supper  wow does he ruin that joke  oh does he ever  for supper  for supper  counselor  you look like assholes  right now man  what's with him  I bet you it's got 
[02:18:00]  something to do with  what was the scene  they were talking about  the fight  where the kid was  there was a kid  Bradley Cooper's  freaking out  and yelling and screaming  and this neighbor's  always taking pictures  trying to get a video  like an interview  so he probably yelled  and screamed  he yelled and screamed  at the guy or whatever  yeah  and I'll bet you  that he took this movie  A because he'll take  anything now  but I bet you  he took this movie  because it touches  something personal  with him  well apparently  Jesus  he's fucking blubbering  like a fucking idiot  yeah 
[02:18:30]  oh my god  I would try to compare  I would be like  you know  I haven't seen you  this upset  since you realized  that breaking  the championship belt  was not a good idea  no but these are  the jewels from the belt  these are the tears  from the douche  let's go backwards  Bob De Niro  she's Bob  where do we pick it up  from around here  this is the best  I've ever seen him  in an interview  for all of you  you know  a communal experience  look at these guys 
[02:19:00]  sitting there  when I first showed him  the screenplay  in his home  we all know people  who have faced  these challenges  and we've all been  touched by these people  and we love these people  you know  and as he says  in the movie  I want to do  everything I can  to help you get back  on your feet  and there's nothing  harder in life  than when you can't  you can't figure out  what to do  you try everything  and you must never stop  you know  your heart just has  to keep growing  but when I first  was in his apartment  and I was talking  about the screenplay 
[02:19:30]  this is what happened  and I thought he was  having hate fever  and I realized  and I realized  he was having  an emotional reaction  I sat there  and I watched  Robert De Niro  cry for 10 minutes  and I said  wow  he's really  connecting with this  by the way  this heartfelt speech  is coming from  the guy that called  Lily Tomlin a cunt  on set  on YouTube  that's the same guy  yeah this is the guy  that kicks the door  and going  you're a fucking cunt  I just don't know  his name  yeah that's right  and by the way  a lot of people say  in the movie  deals with bipolar  we know that  yes  De Niro's father  was supposedly bipolar 
[02:20:00]  oh  right  it's close to his heart  okay  but then this guy  saying the movie  is based loosely  on the director's son  that's why  he got emotional  why would De Niro  get emotional though  I don't think De Niro  would get that emotional  he has to deal with this  in his own life  I would assume  well he said  I know exactly  what he's going through  so somebody  he knows  oh hey  Bob De Niro  we got him right here  oh we got him in the studio  yes  tears of a clown  you know  every playbook 
[02:20:30]  does not have  a silver lining  I live here in New York  support the arts  boo  shut up  shut up  Jim  can you do  valley girl De Niro  somehow  please  pretty please  I don't know if I can do that  oh here it comes  come on  I don't know if I can do that  oh my god  he almost said her something 
[02:21:00]  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  is there more to the De Niro clip  never knock me down Ray  you never knock me down  thank god Ray  you got blood all over  I think his heart would be there 
[02:21:30]  and it is there  well you know  I think one of the reasons  the movie is so powerful  is clearly  because of what we're seeing  here today  and how much you all  now Bradley Cooper's crying  Bradley Cooper's all  she's pissy eyed  what a bunch of fruits  look at this fucking cut  oh that guy is all  Bob Kelly is all crying  look at the cut next to him  it looks like Bradley Cooper  hmm  I got respect for the Bradley Cooper  he was really good in this film  I'm a fan of the guy  I thought he was just kind of a goofball  like you see in Hangover 
[02:22:00]  no no  this guy can fucking act  yeah  he's face man for Christ's sakes  in the 18th  oh that's right  I fucking love that  I didn't see the 18th  he's face man  that's a fucking honor dude  they ask you to play face man  of course  you know  I think  De Niro's son is autistic  that's coming in now  what's the real answer  I think it's something to do  it's gotta be  something to do  with one of the kids  or something  that's always what gets you  we got three  possibilities now  what's the real one  well I would love to have  asked De Niro  and I almost got to do 
[02:22:30]  Leno with him  when I was out in LA  but I just didn't  oh  why would that  I didn't tell you that  they had a sketch idea  they told me on Wednesday  listen Friday  we might want you to do  this sketch  will you be available  I'm like yeah  I'll be in San Diego  but I'll come do  the tonight show first  of course  so I go online  I look up  De Niro was the lead guest  oh my god  I was adamant  but I knew they weren't  going to do it  they just didn't  and I wound up  they wound up not doing it  oh  were you going to do it  with him you think  no but he would have  been on the show  yeah of course  I was heartbroken  heartbroken  you still think about it 
[02:23:00]  every day  but again  it was just one of those  they don't care  they weren't even  thinking of that  they were just like  nah the sketch  just doesn't fit here  or we decide  for them it's just  one sketch  that they're either  going to do or not  you know what  I attribute this to  it's a fucking  old guy  and old guys  get all fucking  emotional  ugh it's disgusting  look at what happened  to George Steinbrenner  remember that  when he was fucking  young and firing  everybody  and he was a fucking  ogre  and then later  he's like  this is the best  team in baseball 
[02:23:30]  oh for Christ sakes  stand here in front  of these guys  I was like  I don't want to see that  can you find that clip  I know we tried to  find it  in the past  I had to watch that  shit too  with fucking  like with Sal  I remember like  Sal driving the boat  drinking and stuff  and then it's like  Christmas shoes  old men just get  all fucking stupid  and emotional  they lose their  testosterone or something  it's nice when they  feel  no it's not  it's embarrassing  I'm happy  why do you take it 
[02:24:00]  to that level  we gotta break you  down someday man  I'm just fucking  I'm happy Sinatra  went brain dead  before he got to  his blubbering face  he was a fucking  cocksucker  until his brain  went out  you know  it's like  beautiful  if anyone out there  can find the  Steinbrenner clip  that we do reference  or references  from time to time  please  we've tried to find it  it was something  we did at N.E.W.  yeah  it was when  the Yankees won  was it the World Series  or the  yeah  the World Series  and he just lost it 
[02:24:30]  in the locker  best team  in baseball  that's the bit  we did  why was he crying  because I don't know  sports  because like Ant said  he got all the  emotional  but I mean  what was the  context of the  speech  they won the  fucking World Series  and it was in the  locker room  and they were  hey let's get  George Steinbrenner  over here  and they put the  mic on  and you were  expecting this  yeah  yeah it was like  the old days  where it's like  well another great  team  we kicked ass  and we took  names  but it was like  these people  to be in the  company  the principal  owner of the 
[02:25:00]  New York Yankees  George Steinbrenner  George  125 wins  in 175 games  could you ever  have fathomed  that this team  would call that  I don't think  anybody would have  this is truly  as great a team  as has ever played  the game of baseball  in my opinion  take the 1904 Cubs  take the 54 Indians  all the great teams  the 61 Yankees  the 27 Yankees  they were all great  this is as great  as any of them  because it's so much  harder  look at these fans  unbelievable  but it's so much  harder today 
[02:25:30]  because you have  three levels  you have to win  the division  then you gotta win  the American League  championship  and Cleveland was  tough  Texas was tough  and then  it's 98  keep listening to the  clip to see if  it's in there  I don't think it is  I thought it was  more in the locker  because he was like  his face was going  he almost broke  down there  yeah it sounded  like it was creeping  up for a second  I got excited  and then it didn't  happen  he was able to  keep it down  Lasorda never  fucking pussed out  no  you don't like 
[02:26:00]  when a man  blubbers yet  no I don't like  when old men  blubber over  fucking nothing  when you watch  you know  a World War II  fucking veteran  and he starts  choking up about  his friend being  blown in half  in front of him  that'll understand  when you see  a fucking guy  blubbering because  of a movie  or a fucking  song  stop it  I don't think  it's your fault  at that age  though I think  it's just part  of the aging process  you lose your masculinity  I think you just  don't control the  emotions like you  used to 
[02:26:30]  it stinks  you know  I mean if you're  more pro to fits  of rage or whatever  as you get older  you're probably  more pro to  crying bouts too  right  what happened  he said hi to me  in the bathroom  today  he's great  I love him  I say hi to him  all the time  but pew pew  I wonder if he's  going to go to  JJ Abrams first  shut up  I love that guy  let me see  were we live there  yeah  you think he regrets  fucking that  no no no no 
[02:27:00]  oh my god  oh god  perfect time  oh my god  wait look at his head  does his head turn  no he just  you see how he walks  around here too  he puts his head down  he knows  he knows everyone  does he know  every time  everyone looks at him  they think of that  they think of that  frump  what are you guys  talking about  oh Joe  we can't say  oh okay  oh Joe  I mean everyone  knows but we can't  we'll tell you  we'll tell you  okay  yeah  everyone knows  but we just  I want to watch  the rest of the  De Niro clip  and Sam's futzing  around watching  sports videos 
[02:27:30]  wasn't it  no  it was 10 more  minutes  oh  good for us  30 seconds  let's hear the last  30 seconds  I'll give you a kiss  come on  dude you know  dude  it's real nice  dude  the reason I said  to David  let him laugh  I said let him laugh  because I understood  what that was  let him laugh  that's what he would do  and it's his nervous  reaction to someone  behaving the way I was 
[02:28:00]  so  well it takes experience  to understand that  and to bring that  to the table as well  and you know  I hate Kelly  I think one of the  many things this movie  is doing is  it's opening a window  into how  jump out of it  why the fuck  can't we get De Niro  yeah  oh my gosh  come on  are you crazy  you're rolling  what are you crazy  that was the best  I've seen De Niro  in an interview  yeah because  he started crying  I think De Niro  is just crying  because he's reminiscing  about the time  he actually broke  a camera over  a guy's head 
[02:28:30]  I would love  to fucking interview him  man  he's really awkward  it's not going to happen  yeah  yeah his  you're right  his actor's studio  I mean  you didn't get  attend to that  in the hour  that he was  on the actor's studio  it was literally  just like  you know  I couldn't even  watch it  I was like  I want to hear  the story  there's nothing  here though  yeah  why don't we  take a break  oh boy  you know what that  means  I don't know  we'll do some  other shit  Evelyn Wood's  speed reading course

[02:41:00]  thumbs up the other day and now he's  talking to TMZ from the hospital I saw  Dennis Hoff was at the cellar and him  and Ron are really close yes so he said  that he's it was the days right when  happy that's not good man it's really  it's rough but to now it looks like he's  hopefully doing the bad part I think  we he's gonna do all right just we told  TMZ welcome to TMZ live and continued  presence in the world thank you Harvey  thanks a lot actually it's my my living  is because the city of Sinai to the 
[02:41:30]  hospital as you know you know it's funny  like you know I don't mind being the  poster boy for going in and getting  checked up you know I believe that John  Ritter died from what I had but I the  difference is I went to the doctor he  didn't you know anything is this thing  is he went to the doctor because he was  having horrendous chest pains yeah  didn't Ritter I thought that was the  thing with Ritter he went to the doctor  but he was just like too late because he  thought it wasn't any wasn't that the  whole story he thought it was died on the 
[02:42:00]  set didn't he it was almost instant with  with Ritter no no Ritter might have felt it  earlier and just not gone that day I'm  guessing yeah okay okay that stuff so  misleading though you could think it's  like fucking gas pains you know people  think they're having like indigestion  they're having like a fucking mini  heart attack and broccoli don't to me  Joe well and I mean open a lot of people  whatever we look like some people call a  man it was not and that's always the  different people I understand look very  similar I you know less alike you know  what guys I'm I'm out of line I'm out of 
[02:42:30]  fucking lines open in there he doesn't  even he doesn't listen and he doesn't  even know who the fuck he's talking to  and he doesn't focus are you doing a  Frank Sinatra impression today you know  I'm gonna start crying in a second  terrible it's an aneurysm it's a aortic  aneurysm so so Ron how how bad was this  well your skin is tearing away from the  aorta and and I think a lot of my  carelessness probably created it you know  that's not you know being heavy you're 
[02:43:00]  having high blood pressure those are the  main factors that cause it you know and  the thing is so I I went I had chest  pains I had tingling in my extremities  feet hands chest pain back pain I think  this is exactly what I was warned about I  was on the way to the flight to the east  coast for an amazing event I was so  close to not doing it but all the doctors  tell me had I got on that plane I'd be a  dead man so so Ron how close do they say 
[02:43:30]  you work why do doctors have to tell you  that shit that's smart though because  this way if you ever feel it again you'll  not like that yeah you got lucky make  you grateful I think at that point you're  pretty aware you don't need a doctor to  say you know if you got on that plane  you'd be a dead man I agree with Jim  saying though they're saying like you  know this is how fucking close you are so  next time you know smarten up and  smarten up now and don't when you get  out of the hospital don't think you can  go back to your old life be grateful like  that's imagine if you said like if you  flew you'd be dead today that's a  really final thought of course you think 
[02:44:00]  the Viagra had something to do with  this I don't know imagine a guy like  Jeremy pops a few I don't know he takes  it yeah I don't know for sure either he  claimed in his documentary that he did  not take Viagra he actually kind of  brags and he goes he goes you know I  come from an era where there was no  Viagra you had to fucking perform in  this business so and he's very proud of  that so I don't know if he was a big  Viagra I mean now that he's oh my god  that got Anthony's back I'm just  watching the clock I didn't know what 
[02:44:30]  to oh my god fucking showing right down  the tubes yes what happens you leave  the room oh my god let me talk terrible  you have no idea what we did we could  have literally been sitting here I  don't silence I wish I wish I didn't  have it I was a fucking bongo a bongo  solo going on and the music in the  bathroom nice it must be the dead show  it's usually some fucking the drum  hard bass jazz this was just it was

[02:59:30]  big rage and I have a goddamn giant rock no  it's just I'm disgusted I was gonna say I  know I'm heterosexual and I'm tingling a  little bit  all red man yeah look how red you get  what is that about  breaking news yeah the radio wizard is  using the crazy glue to keep the  remaining hairs on his head oh oh oh it's  just me right just plain mean what we 
[03:00:00]  got  Jesus I think a good firm bare-bottom  spanky would straighten their whole show  right out  so it's yeah I guess I don't I really  don't want to do it yeah we believe you  don't worry about yeah we believe you  when you say that when it's you know  forced right it's always said of course  you're being forced against your will  you have to kick while he's doing like no  no yeah what is that tat this one yeah I  got that when I was 15 is really really 
[03:00:30]  fucking ghetto it's a fleur-de-lis a  what a fleur-de-lis the things on top of  the fences yeah I never got it filled in  I went to this really ghetto like in  New Orleans Saints thing we saw I got  that tat what he learned at a tire  Windsor not what are the other tats we  didn't realize you're all tatted up  what's that I just got that one that  one I got back in September it's like a  doily really does he hangs his arm over  the sofa mr. grandma I guess he cozy  yeah what is that is that the staff of 
[03:01:00]  rock no no no she got the other tats  that went out yeah no anything else what  else you got no I got I got a port wine  stain above my ass crack which looks like  I forgot to wait let's see that oh geez  that's not bad it's a tea and a little stain  yeah it's like an arrow for cum  why you look like that Troy what happened 
[03:01:30]  why are you creeped out you know you  know why he's creeped out why because  this is very similar remember our old  intern Sean no no he was the one who's  Troy fucked his girlfriend oh right  this is a very similar situation where  like all of a sudden it's all like oh  you know we're just playing around  never fun and games and then all of a  sudden the person starts to develop  weird feelings so he was weird I thought  I thought you're gonna murder me to be 
[03:02:00]  honest you dog this girl was she a good  fuck pretty good yeah she was fun she  blow you yeah that's cool oh man yeah  hey always better eat her ass no she  blew me in the park  that's nice while blowing in the park  one day in the very very cold month of  January January just ruined everything  I think a good bare-bottled spanking will  bring the show home and also so gets very  red his ass is gonna be all red 
[03:02:30]  absolutely warm like an orangutan ass I  think we have to I mean what better way  to straighten everybody out the mood in  here has been very strange yeah a good  bare-bottled spanking bring everyone  back together when Troy spanking him he  should say you're a naughty naughty boy  yes and I think that South should call  Troy daddy while he's being spanked yeah  oh god I agree yeah good bare-bottled  spanking bring this whole thing oh lord no  bare-bottom bare-hand not to use a belt 
[03:03:00]  around his neck yeah to help him yeah  come on pants down let's go oh god  let's go bare-bottom spanking oh jeez are  you wearing underwear yeah are you gonna  not too hard are you gonna do a little  fantasy play like what what you got it  you got to tell him what he did bad and  and and then Sal's got to tell him that  how we won't how we won't do it again 
[03:03:30]  and it's so red and you have to  discipline him he looks like he was out  the woods it really is I'm doing the  rest of the show under protest I just  it's kind of like a baseball game yeah  this game is under prone to protest yes  got a film for later review yes you are  red and now you're about to get your  ass spanked all right Troy Kwanis yeah  what are you fucking world star hip-hop  why do you do that turn it sideways  start the video yeah because now now the

[03:05:00]  gonna put the icing on this cake I want  to be in the radio Hall of Fame someday  it's gonna put the icing in my pants I  think that this whole show has been  leading up to yes yes and I think that  what we need is a real rough day on  everybody it'll be nice to let the  stress out yeah bare-bottom spanking  will really will really put the the  capper the nightcap on this program  what what did you do what did you do  yeah I was so bad Sal why is why is

[03:08:30]  you sure this is what the show needed today huh jimmy yeah  just don't take his dick I think what the show really needed is to straighten it out  is he uh what is he aroused no he's never on  I think that's why he won't take his pecker out  people are asking what happened to the show  well jimmy thinks this is what the show needed  what happened was the show got off course  and uh a good bare-bottom spanking is what we really needed to us to straighten the needle 
[03:09:00]  you sure this is what we needed huh he's taping him up like look at how red his ass is  oh my god  oh you too uh wow uh what about oh yeah break that tape  it really is red  yeah that's well you know that's what happens i bet your dinner won't be late again though

[03:11:00]  I don't know I think his arm or something  it's fine  it was a mistake  yeah  nothing that they can't straighten out  with a good bare bottom spanking  what happens is  things get crazy  what we really need here is a  a bare bottom spanking  to mend relationships  bare bottom spanking  Jimmy and Sis though  this is the only  only thing  yes  we got to get back on the same page  we got to get back  get back on the same page  you get these relationships  mended  what in a little meeting  after the show  do the same trick  no I think what happens is 
[03:11:30]  Sal began to object  and I think what we really need  is a good  a good bare bottom spanking  to mend fences  not a meeting  between ourselves  no  Sal you might want to  let it all out  holy shit  that was  crazy gay  yeah  Sal really seemed to  enjoy that  Sal took his punishment  right on the money  Troy meted out  yeah  Troy meted out the punishment  oh yeah  Sal an ass man 
[03:12:00]  Justin Stengel  who is the head writer  for David Letterman  yeah  and a fan of ours  writes  just tuned in  no idea  what the hell's going on  as a listener  not entirely sure  this is what the show  needed  Jim Norman  oh Jim  well you know  what happened was  Jimmy  the show is right back  on track now  and I think  what you can attribute  that to  the bare bottom spanking  that occurred here  moments ago  the show needed  Jim Norman 
[03:12:30]  insists  that this is  what was needed  yeah  there might have been  a couple people  that tapped out  but they don't have  the responsibility  of presenting  a radio show  so little time  alright  get your pants  and get out of here  good job  Sal  oh Sal  oh you know what  if you go to  Rolando  RolandoS99  on Instagram  you will see  where your pants are  oh no  Jesus 
[03:13:00]  oh no  what did they do  to his pants  RolandoS99  Roland's not in the  best mood  no  but he took a picture  of E-Rock radio  on Twitter  holding up  Sal's  pants  oh  they're in the  and I guess  you pissed off  E-Rock yesterday  so he stole your  pants  I'm getting word  E-Rock  why did he  piss you off  yesterday  he decided  to break  one of the  wrestling DVDs  that came in  from the WWE  thinking he was smart  and took it  and decided to  smash it 
[03:13:30]  across the console  in the office  oh shit  yeah  let me ask you this  would Sal  be allowed  to run around  in his underpants  out there  no  I mean  it's probably  a bad look  no I'm sure  they would get  very upset  why  I'm just asking  because  somebody would  complain  yeah  you can't  walk out  there'd be  a woman  that would  be like  oh  and then  she'd say  like  well if this  show  has learned  how to  right the  ship  why is  the rest  of the  platform  not doing  enough  straightening  out  in their  own 
[03:14:00]  studios  so  what do  you think  they need  so you  think  there should  be  policy  Jimmy  when things  go awry  when things  go awry  a good  bare-bottom  spanking  is what's  needed  it's clearly  the answer  have we  proven it  here today  yes I believe  we have  a good  bare-bottom  spanking  is clearly  the solution  to any of  your company's  woes  you think  the guys  upstairs  could learn  from us  today  I really  think so  yeah  it's what  they all  need  this guy  just writes  so I'm  about to  throw up 
[03:14:30]  well  you aren't  in the  room  exactly  and you  you don't  have a  show to  fix  we had a  broken  product  here  people are  insisting  that the  show did  not need  that  oh really  yes they're  insisting  I absolutely  agree with  you Jim  yeah  I think  you were  right on  the fucking  money  I think  so  how's  your ass  you alright  my ass  is a little  clammy  from the  tape  it's clammy  and the  hand  the nervous  energy  between two 
[03:15:00]  men  when there's  a mission  to be  accomplished  there's a  nervous  anticipation  between  two men  for the  sake of  the show  right  nervous  anticipation  I think  what happens  is Troy's  hands get  a little  clammy  when he  knows  he's  about  to  administer  the  appropriate  discipline  and Sal  begins to  sweat  on his  buttocks  when he  understands  the  clammy  punishment  headed his  way  Rolando  R-O-L-A-N-D-O 
[03:15:30]  S-99  on Instagram  could have  just Instagrammed  the greatest  picture ever  look at this  Joe DeRosa  filming the  action  and all you  see is  Sal  naked  from  the half  butt  down  so you  don't even  know what  the fuck  he's doing  that moved  things around  in me  that I didn't  know I  needed moving  around  yeah I  felt like  that sort  of slid  some furniture  out and I  found some  things behind  that furniture  that I  didn't want  to fucking  find right  now  your penis  moved a  little  home  it was  bad  there was 
[03:16:00]  a tiny  tingle  during that  whole  experience  I don't  think in a  homosexual way  I think  it's just  more in a  disciplinary  way  yeah  how did  that go  for you  there Troy  it's good  are we  waxing him  tomorrow  yeah I  think so  we're gonna  wax you  for real  tomorrow  Brazilian  do you  insist  well yeah  that was  the agreement  right  that's  taint  asshole  Jimmy what a  good Brazilian  waxing  I think it's  sometimes a good 
[03:16:30]  waxing  is good  just to make  sure that things  stay the course  but as of  today  I think we  accomplished what  needed to be  done  yeah  and I  believe that  the clamminess  that these  men shared  just goes to  prove my  point  what point  is that  the show  was out of  whack  and good  bare bottoms  spanking  brought things  put them  right back  on kilter  you look like  a prosecution 
[03:17:00]  attorney that  doesn't bind  what the witness  is saying  and what  point is that  I wasn't even  looking at him  what point is that  if Jimmy  insists  then I guess  we did  accomplish some  things  it wasn't  what I felt  I just felt  that you know  the show  needed to  take its  medicine  Sal still  has no  pants  no no  he's standing  there  in his  undies  UPS  Sean just  writes  our cue  is less  gay  I can't 
[03:17:30]  even argue  that  UPS  Sean can  fix whatever  radio show  he needs  to fix  with whatever  manner he  deems fit  we saw  what needed  to be done  and we  did it  and we  went for  it  yes we  accomplished  is it time  for line  of the day  yep  line of the  day  mask  sexual  flavors  is the  new way  to foreplay  available  in four  tantalizing  flavors  these oral  gel strips  will be the  spark to  light your  bedroom flame  page two  visit  sexual  flavors

[03:18:30]  insisted  yeah  exactly  much to my  chagrin  Sal left  his underpants  halfway on  but I felt  that we  you know  whatever  we got  what we  needed  mission  accomplished  I really  wanted the  penis out  crossing the  finish line  as we  I just  wanted to  know that  his penis  was pressing  against Troy's  leg  and then  getting further  pressed with  the impact  of the ass  slapping  I wanted to  know that  that was  happening  we'll see 
[03:19:00]  tomorrow  I just  wanted to  see what  it would  do  like what  would  happen  afterwards  whatever  this is all  leading up to  our big  one and done  gay off  I have to  plug real quick  I'll be in  Caroline's in  April but  this month  February 17th  I think I have  one show on  sale with  Attell, Amy  and Artie  the first show  is sold out  at the Borgata  late show is  available  and then February  22nd, 23rd  I'm in Vegas  at the MGM  with David Attell  that's it

[03:26:00]  show  I get  if you learn  something  866-WOW1-WOW  is the phone number  but I'm almost afraid  I mean  we try to be  responsible teachers  here at the OPI  and Anthony show  but I don't quite  know what happened  today  it got  E-Rock  what did you think  of today's show  did you learn  anything  well I learned  I guess  the way to  bring everyone  together  and resolve  all our issues  is with a  bare bottom  spanking  yeah  where's Sal  I think he's  doing the replay  the replay  the show's not  even over yet  no I mean 
[03:26:30]  sorry  switching over  from the recording  of the main show  to yours  oh  you gave him  his pants back  yeah  we put him  on the chair  that's all you  did  we took a photo  with him  and he had to  walk in in his  underwear and get  his pants  oh that was  your prank  yeah  probably could have  gotten him worse  than that if you  had possession  of his pants  I could have  Sal how are you  feeling  humiliated  embarrassed  oh I'm sorry  erect 
[03:27:00]  yes  Eric put some  fucking shit  in my pants  and it smells  really bad  okay  I knew you were  lying when you  said that was  your whole prank  did you put shit  in Sal's pants  I didn't put shit  in Sal's pants  not shit but  something foreign  what is it  smell my hand  how does it smell  no wait  how does it smell  smell like  it smells like  it's cologne  smell the ass  just smell the pants  you smell anything  you had a nose job  so you should be able  to smell it  I can smell good  smell it 
[03:27:30]  just smell the pants  then  alright  let me smell your pants  Troy's smelling  Sal's pants  I'm not gonna have him  go any further  I don't smell anything  it smells  I don't know  it smells like  that's what I said  you did something  though because  they're fucking wet  your pants are wet  Eric did you wet  Sal's pants  I didn't wet his pants  no  did you put anything  on them  I did not put shit  in his pants  he's reprising  his shit  he's not saying  what he put  in my pants  weird stuff going  on around here  huh Troy  yeah  it was a weird day  really weird  yeah  I think I hit it  on the head  personally 
[03:28:00]  I mean you heard  the line of the day  was me mentioning  the fact  or not the line of the day  the runner up  was me mentioning  the fact that maybe  we're getting to  what is known  as a boiling point  around here  yeah  but you had  Roland snapping  a gym out of nowhere  Kenny was fed up  with I think with  Jim and Opie  or maybe not Opie  but at least  Kenny was fed up  with something  because he came in here  and wanted the whole  conversation to cease fire  E-Rock was in there  with a short fuse  and then wouldn't  admit to it  yep  the problem is 
[03:28:30]  nobody really goes into it  everybody just wants  to sweep it under the rug  you think so  there's a huge problem  what is it  what's the problem  yeah  I don't know  if that's really  for me to discuss  I mean if it questioned  what my problem was  you have a problem  no I mean  you know  I have frustration  like everybody else  and if the guys  ask me  I would answer it  but you know  I mean there's just  it's just  it's getting to the  boiling point  and it's just kind of like  when it comes up  it's just kind of like  well let's divert  and talk about something else  see the interesting thing  I feel like 
[03:29:00]  E-Rock  and Roland  and Kenny  deal with their  frustrations one way  where probably Roland  is the worst culprit  of the three of them  just snaps at you  out of nowhere  and you're like  well okay  you obviously have a problem  let's get into this  whereas you Troy  you don't really  snap at people  instead I feel like  your frustrations  build and build  and then you come  into the studio  and start doing  weird gay shit  well you gotta get  your anger out somehow  right  is that what happens  well  I don't think one 
[03:29:30]  has anything to do  with the other  you don't  cause it seems like  lately that's been  your thing more and more  just because  I'll do what the guys  need me to do  but you'll come in  and be like  yo we should do this  yeah but I didn't say that  Opie was like  where's Troy  get Troy in here to wax him  but then you were like  let's put super glue  on his nipples  well yeah I mean  if I'm in here  I'm gonna try to make  the bit as good as I can  you want to accomplish  the goal to the best  of your abilities  right  and Sal you're just  Edgar agreeable  all of a sudden  damn  well not really 
[03:30:00]  why do you say that  he put up a little bit  of a fight  yeah because I thought  you were gonna  fucking tie up my ankles  and put me outside  that's what I thought  was going on  well I don't know  once you were tied up  I don't know  what we were gonna do  did he punch you in the face  he elbowed me or something  no no  I honestly didn't do it  intentionally  no I'm not mad  I'd be mad if my nose broke  because you just paid  for that nose  right  you know  you can't go back  and be like yeah  and especially  they'll be like  how did it break  and you show them  a picture of Sal  and be like  this guy broke it  me spanking Sal  yeah I was spanking  this guy  things got really weird  you know yesterday  we were talking about  the footage of  Cream Pie Jones 
[03:30:30]  costing him opportunities  in his own mind  yeah  do you worry that  now there's video  of you  in your underpants  being spanked  by Troy  and you looked  very  it was very  it was the gayest  bare bottom spanking  we've done on the show  for sure  like Sal looked  very like  into it  into it  and this was the position  like it didn't look  that much like a goof  Sal looked sexual  when it was happening  and that was strange  for me  really  strange to see  everybody felt  uncomfortable  I didn't feel  I don't care  did you get a sexual 
[03:31:00]  vibe from Sal  no  no  but you also  were trying to  displace yourself  from it  I think mentally  you go someplace else  honestly  I don't care  gay shit's funny  like I have no problem  I mean I'm not gonna  suck a cock  but  you wouldn't  no  okay  but I'll spank Sal  you would  would you jerk him off  no  would you touch it  would you slap him  in the dick  can I wear a glove  no  hand on dick  but just like a slap  like slap him in his dick  yeah  you would do that  sure  sure  Sal would you take a slap  in the dick  uh 
[03:31:30]  if it wasn't like  you would  I think you would  at this point  like right on the helmet  yeah  you would  I'm not gonna ask you  to do it  yes you are  not here  I'm gonna say  yeah let's do it  and then you're like  no I don't want  we'll bring it up tomorrow  I mean I might bring it up tomorrow  no I don't want to do that  well you're getting waxed tomorrow  yeah that's that's different  that's more of a hygienic thing  try just slapping me on the dick  it's just fucking weird  let me take some of these calls  919  you're on after  Opie and Anthony live  so uh  I think the show's now 
[03:32:00]  officially gone gay  either the attorneys  or  or  people associated with the show  but  holy shit  when are we gonna go back to hetero  yeah I don't know  maybe it's just because  it seems more and more  like we just kind of  think of things on the fly  and we just have a bunch of dudes  around here  yeah  you think about like  when people are in prison  guys who would be the toughest  you know  grimiest dude outside  they  they can potentially do gay shit  sounds like Sal's trying to make excuses  for himself  I'm not trying to make excuses  a little bit right  like I'm a tough guy  outside of here 
[03:32:30]  I knew you were gonna go there  I'm just saying  but like when you're  around a bunch of guys all day  like what's funny is to do  gay shit out of the norm  you know  the problem is  right  you know  we have access to all these  like penthouse girls and stuff  that we could be doing fun shit  with them  nobody wants to  well we don't plan anything  in advance is the thing  but we easily could  we plan the gay off  if you're being spontaneous  with the guys  why don't you be spontaneous  when the chicks are there  we would appreciate it a whole lot more  yeah you're probably right  I mean  yeah  I have no problem with it  it's just 
[03:33:00]  I'm just taking cues from whatever  but there's no  there's no way  with the girl  you have to ask that permission  like oh can we touch your tits  or that sort of stuff  Troy says I'm gonna spank you  it's like alright whatever  it's just  I mean I believe you  I could get fun girls in here  that are willing to do some crazy shit  yeah but there's not the  level of humiliation  that there is  when it's a dude  right  but  as a  you know  you have to think about the listener too  sure gay shit's funny  but it's also fun to hear girls in the studio  yeah  living vicariously through  but then it just turns out  everybody's just hitting on them anyway  that's what happens  yeah  everybody just wants to be like  yo  I'm trying to fuck you 
[03:33:30]  and I'm gonna make it clear  yeah  and I don't want to do anything  disrespectful to you  because  I'm trying to fuck you  right  that's what happens with girls  well  I mean if you were sitting there  looking at them  and you thought to yourself  I might get to fuck this chick  you'd probably think differently right  I probably would  alright  talk to you later  appreciate his honesty  2-1-0  2-1-0  you're on after Opie and Anthony live  yes  I need to know  what kind of bloomers  is Sal wearing  is this lady trucker  yes sir  I thought so  Sal was wearing some  Calvin Klein boxer briefs 
[03:34:00]  yeah I wear the same underwear  every day  I have like Calvin Klein  boxer briefs  you gotta change them  you gotta wash them  you gotta do something  I have like 30 of the same ones  why  like Inspector Gadget  yeah  why  I don't know  they're just comfortable  why didn't you take your dick out today  because I don't want  I don't want to have my dick  being filmed by Joe DeRose  it's like Joe DeRose  has a fucking video of my dick on his phone  yeah but instead  he's got a video of you  leaning over Troy's lap  with your ass out  and being spanked  and calling him daddy  yeah  well that's you know  part of the bit  is that how you'll explain it away 
[03:34:30]  yeah  I don't  I don't even care  you should pull out your dick for the show  you think so  yeah  would you have  yeah  you would have  Joe kept insisting through the whole thing  that he wasn't seeing enough penis  there's a lot of gayness in Joe DeRose  you know what I mean  there's a lot of  a lot of  yeah you want to talk about people making it sexual  a lot of repressed sexuality  going on with Joe DeRose  is there not  yeah  there is  let's go to Pete  Pete  yeah how's up  how are you  I want to make a comment  that on your day  you do the gay off 
[03:35:00]  make sure Joe DeRose  can come in  and I guarantee  he'll show up with knee pads  I thought I was the entertainment guy  I mean I don't know  I'm just doing it for the bit  either that  invite him in  and give him a present  when he opens it up  with knee pads  yeah  thanks Pete  tell me this Troy  yeah  you know you've done some weird shit  with weird people  yeah  as you do more of these  bits with Sal  the last time you worked with Sal  worked with  it was him eating a chocolate covered strawberry  out of your asshole  now it's 
[03:35:30]  you  holding Sal  just about nude  over your lap  and spanking him on the cheeks  yeah  does it get  weirder with Sal  or does more of a camaraderie build  cause if it's like a gay to be funny bit  that starts to build a camaraderie  like oh dude  that was ridiculous  what we just did  haha  let's go fuck some chicks  yeah  I mean I like Sal  Sal's cool  I mean we just  does it get weirder  or does it more of a camaraderie build  as the bits go on  probably more of a camaraderie 
[03:36:00]  you think so  yeah I mean it's  it's fine  I don't  I don't feel uncomfortable around him  it's not like we can't look at each other  we walk by each other  and have to put our heads down  right  you think your friendship is  getting stronger because of this  I don't know  I mean it's fine  you know it's just  Sal  I felt closer to Troy  after biting the strawberry  out of his ass  definitely  you did  yeah we just like  you don't think it's weird  the way he says that  I think Sal says a lot of things  that are weird  yeah he does right  yeah  that's what I'm saying  like for me  I'll just tell you my perspective  as somebody who watches  all this going down 
[03:36:30]  like I get a little  it's a little more weird  with Sal around now  because I don't see this  Sal being funny  you don't  you just want to imply  that I'm gay Sal  I don't know what it is  that's all you're getting at  but I think it's weird  I think Sal is one of the guys  that it's weird with  Sal definitely has  some  homosexual characteristics  yeah  and I  and I've told him that  I've told him that off the air too  I don't  I'm not  I'm not offending you  we said it on and off the air  so it's like  yeah it's like that 
[03:37:00]  but that doesn't get shaken  like when  when he does these bits  it doesn't like  come across like  oh yeah he is just goofing  necessarily  you think  it's kind of like  there's still a weird sexuality  about it  that isn't like  for instance  if Norton is spanking E-Rock  yeah  no sexuality there  when you were spanking Sal  there was a weird sexuality  and that's why  that's why Ant wouldn't look  at either of you  with me  I mean I don't  I don't feel like  it's just there  you're looking into it  too much  I don't know 
[03:37:30]  I'm observing what I see  I mean I  today  you were walking around here  in your underwear  with your ass sticking out  laying across Troy's lap  for a spanking  I don't see that  as looking into it too much  I think that's worth  talking about  yeah  but  right  is that my wrong  there's no sexuality  between me and Troy  there's no sexuality  with me  I can't speak for you  right  do you pick up  on sexuality  well you're implying  that I have a crush on Troy  no  so then there's nothing  between us  I think  Sal 
[03:38:00]  is a little  has a little confusion  in his sexuality  that's all it could be  like I don't know  if he's really clear  he's not clear  on definite lines  I'm not sitting there  I'm not saying  Sal is sitting there  and while he's getting spanked  he's like  I would love to fuck Troy  right  that's a little  that's a little extreme Sal  we're not talking  in blacks and whites here  we're talking about  a certain air of sexuality  that's there  that I think  that's why the listeners  and quite frankly  Opie and Anthony  get very uncomfortable  and Opie and Anthony 
[03:38:30]  were very uncomfortable today  but that's funny  I think that's funny  I love seeing those guys  uncomfortable  they were really uncomfortable  I don't give a fuck  like it's funny to me  but like  when Kenny was getting spanked  a few years ago  they weren't uncomfortable  yeah  because Kenny exudes  heterosexuality  I also  well Sal does not exude  heterosexuality  number one  right  number two  I don't know if  Sal has ever really been  in situations  goofing like this  so it's probably  very  it's probably very taboo to him 
[03:39:00]  to goof around  goof around like this  so he still got  so he coupled  because it's taboo  sexually  it's also taboo  to goof around  and that same taboo  just draws both  those things together  right  like I've been  in enough weird situations  where  to this point  spanking a guy  is  it's  it's a goof  it's a goof  who cares  and I think you've made it clear  that  from every time  you've been on the show  you don't give a fuck  you're down for 
[03:39:30]  as some may say  whatever  and as time is  progressing  and moving forward  I'm giving less  and less of a fuck  really  yes  that's the  and that's what I mean  I think  your frustrations here  lead to you giving  less of a fuck  which leads to you  doing a lot more  over the top stuff  on the end  yeah  I don't  whatever  whatever you need  I don't give a shit  let's talk to  oh it's  Luke is calling up again  Luke  what do you want now  I was just saying 
[03:40:00]  you need to trade Sal  to like  Al Q or something  they'd love to have  a little twink  who's up to doing  all sorts of gay stuff  I mean they'd love it  you know  are you sick of Luke already  he just like  sends me things on Twitter  and stuff like that  it's just like  Luke do you have any suggestions  on who else to hire  uh  I don't know  me  you like that Sal  that's a good one  you thought that was funny  oh shit  oh you're such a dork Sal  ugh 
[03:40:30]  he can't even understand sarcasm  you don't think so  no  he wasn't the one in here  in his underpants was he  no  oh so you mean  it's true I should work there  not you  that's what you're saying  what are you saying Sal  you have trouble communicating  you're as confused as I am Sam right  yeah yeah  actually  to be fair Luke  and I'll give it to Sal  when he deserves it  I think that  you came out of nowhere  with your response  on that one  oh okay  he was saying it was sarcasm  I don't know  alright look  it's obvious to me  Sal and Luke are not exactly 
[03:41:00]  mental giants  this is not a war  that I want to get involved in  no  he just sends me like  stupid tweets and stuff like that  he does  he's just trying to rattle your chest  yeah he's just trying to  it doesn't even phase me  no  I don't even block him  because like he can say  whatever he wants to  it means that little to you  yeah  you think he's a goof  I mean he did some funny stuff  for the show  you've been here now  how long  about a year  about a year already  for higher  yeah  coming up on a year  yeah  that's great  it's been a rough go of it  sometimes  sometimes 
[03:41:30]  some weird shit  some good shit too  yeah  meeting Luke  he's called you  this is a guy who was on the after show last week  and was trying to get Sal's job  and challenged him to a jingle off  and all this stuff  do you think Luke has the right perspective  on what life is like here  do you think he'd be able to manage this  I don't think  I'd say the average listener  doesn't understand really what goes on  you know like  because a lot of times  you'll make a joke  and it's an obvious joke  and then people will  misinterpret it 
[03:42:00]  as you telling the truth  glom on to it  right  and I think that's just a common thing  with radio in general  but like  you should be in the know  with the nature of the ONA show  that  do you think that it's  it's more difficult to survive here  than people realize  um  based on the fact that  you've had a rough time  yeah I would say  I've had a rough time  I would  yeah I would too  I mean like  Iraq  yeah I think  it's definitely worse  than people think  and do you think Sal's  had a rough go of it  uh yeah I think he has 
[03:42:30]  yeah  yeah  okay so then yeah  I'll say it's rough  but it doesn't  it doesn't uh  but then you guys  that's when you have listeners  a lot of listeners  like Luke  who are like  oh Sal can't cut it  I can cut it  oh yeah I mean  on Twitter all the time  people be like  dude I can do your fucking job  do you think that  do you think that they can  um  some could  oh jeez  not all  I'm just being honest  I'm telling you  all right  but but I don't think  Luke can  why  uh I don't know  he just he doesn't get it  he doesn't get the 
[03:43:00]  the show as  on a finer scale  that I think I do  Mike in Ohio  hey how are ya  what's up buddy  I was just kind of curious  how we went from uh  uh chick pissing  to chocolatey  to spanking  some guy's ass  I have no idea  what happened today  I don't have a clue  what the what  today's show was  I was I was entertained  by it throughout  uh  oh it was entertaining  a lot happened  I will say that  uh  but I don't know  what happened  I don't know  what today was 
[03:43:30]  today was a weird one  from top to bottom  yeah  yeah I agree  alright thanks Mike  kinda crazy  thanks man  it was uncomfortable  in in many ways  yeah  yeah  and we like  it was like  we traded out  this sort of uh  uncomfortableness  of you know  what's beneath the surface  with uncomfortableness  of  we're watching a man  spank another man now  and I love uncomfortable  so it's  you did  I love it  you were enjoying it  I enjoy the whole thing  yeah  yeah  you know  I mean I wish  you know 
[03:44:00]  well whatever  what  I wish people would say  what was really on their mind  who do you think isn't  I think everybody in questioned  I think that nobody is  is saying really  what they're thinking  and they just  just sweep  it's easy  it's so much easier  to sweep things under the rug  instead of confronting them  and dealing with the problem  you're talking more about  Roland today  and when he came in  like a house of fire 
[03:44:30]  and we never really found out why  well look  Roland has a tough  fucking job  he really does  yeah  it's very difficult  and it's a lot of  playing a certain way  and acting a certain way  and unfortunately  Roland  he takes  he takes a lot of abuse  he really does  and he's got to juggle it  worse than anybody  probably  yes  because he's got more people  to deal with  but  I think he deals with  work stress  worse than anybody as well  which is a rough combination  the fact that he's got more of it 
[03:45:00]  and has to deal  and deals with it  worse  makes it  I mean it's impossible  yeah  Roland should go for some therapy  I think  oh my god  he'd never come out  Roland should go for some therapy  it would be beneficial for him  do you go to therapy?  no I'm definitely going to start going  you are?  yeah  how come?  I just I think I need it  I need to get  you know the inner gay in me  to be accepted  you know  you think so?  I just have to go to therapy  I think that's serious  wouldn't it be funny  if Sal went to therapy  and he was like  dude  you guys were right 
[03:45:30]  you guys were right  and by the way  if you did that Sal  we'd be like  you're the man  I know  I know you guys  you'd be supportive  and that's fine  but I'm telling you  that's not the way  I feel currently in my life  I believe that  do you see why though  we question your sexuality?  yes I get it  and I don't  I don't  care  he's not there  that's not the way he feels  it's not the way he feels  but we aren't  completely out of the blue  pulling this out of thin air  like you understand  why we  say the thing  like when Troy says something  you don't go like  where do you get that from?  no because that seems  more suspicious 
[03:46:00]  right  but that's not how you feel either  you're like okay  I get that  but it's not true  but I get why he thinks that  no  I gotcha  Dan  hey guys  what's up buddy?  what happened to the days  of little Jimmy  calling up female  I say female listeners  and like making them  cum on the phone  and like  I used to drive around  and get rods in my car  listening to the show  because it was sexy  now it's just  fucking gayness  and has been for years dude  I haven't gotten a rod  in my car  listening to ONA in years  what the fuck? 
[03:46:30]  I mean I don't know  I didn't  I guess I didn't realize  our purpose  have we been entertaining  in other ways?  I mean I'm sorry  you can't masturbate  to the show anymore  but  no no  my whole purpose  of listening to the show  is not to get a rod  I would just be surprised  you know  as a listener  just one day  listening  and on occasion  you know  there would be sexy shit  involving females  on the show  and like  like Jimmy  in the studio  I would just start  filling up in my car  you know  the sexiness is gone  it's all been replaced 
[03:47:00]  with gayness  you're right Dan  maybe we should  try  as a staff anyway  there's only so much  we can do  but we should  once the gay off  is complete  let's cap the gayness  there  what do you think  and then try to move on  if we're gonna get sexual  to something that's  a little more heterosexual  I love the idea  I mean I always like  girls on the show  yeah  I always think  that that's a great idea  everybody loves hearing girls  even just talking  you know what I mean  like just too much testosterone  it's just like  it's a lot of it in here 
[03:47:30]  yeah  so it's like  Dr. Steve would love it  so to get girls  but again  it just  it's not up to us  the staff  to bring the girls on  the hosts have to want it  and they also have to be  willing to  come up with ideas  to make it  an interesting bit  yeah  because just interviewing  penthouse girls  on their lives  nobody gives a fuck  that's right  we have to start  coming up with  ideas as good  as the gay off  right  but with chicks  maybe the les off  is something we could do  but then again  it's like what we said  it takes  it always takes a turn 
[03:48:00]  it does doesn't it  because it's like  everybody  everybody wants to  fuck them  it's tough  it's tough  Trugger Bob  yeah just  you know  knowing what  all goes through  with his job  doesn't that make  Luke will look gay  for wanting his job  maybe  maybe  if you listen to this show  and you're thinking  Sal's is the position  I want to be in  especially over the past  couple weeks  it's questionable  it's weird  I'd probably want to  fill roles on the show 
[03:48:30]  other than yours Sal  mine would probably  be more appealing to me  I think  you know  speaking of me  I wanted to talk to you  about Steven Singer  everybody knows  it's the best place  in the country  to buy a diamond  but what a lot of  people forget  people forget it  all the time  Steven Singer  is also the best place  to go for Valentine's Day  they have everything  you know Steven's  always come out  with something new  that's going to  blow your chick away  this Valentine's Day  you can give her  something really special  something that  no one else has

[03:50:30]  nah  just you know  Sal sits there  yeah okay  it's rough  doing that show  I'm sure  and all the  behind scenes stuff  but really  what has Sal done  personally  I've been  I've been doing  acting and music  and choirs  and shit like that  where have we seen you  well no  no no no  lower tier  that's not to say  they don't do as much work  as higher tier people  you know what I mean  oh  but I understand  how much work  goes into stuff like that  and yes  I have sent in shit  that the hosts  have laughed at 
[03:51:00]  you know  so hey  I get a little inkling  hey maybe  I might be able to do  something like that  Sal's the lowest man  on the totem pole  so what  I'm gonna oust Sam  or Eroch  that's not gonna happen  you know what I mean  exactly  so who do you go for  you go for the low man  who sucks  do you suck Sal  do you feel that way  and I feel like  I'm a little bit better  than him  probably a lot bit  but I'm just gonna say  a little bit  not to you know  toot my own horn  do you think Luke  might be a little bit  better than you  no  you think he's a tiny bit  better than you  do you think you're 
[03:51:30]  better than him  at this  at what  working for O&A  exactly  at what  I would say yes  I mean  I think if he came here  it would be very different  it's not like you just  jump in and  you know  you're killing it  well obviously  believe me  I've worked a lot of places  I've moved around  a lot of things  where do you work currently  Luke  don't say specifically  what field do you work in  what's that  what field do you  currently work in  right now  I work in the  industrial field  I run a CNC machine 
[03:52:00]  that routes metal  for windows and doors  we deliver all over  New England  New York  all over the place  E-Rock  we can't even  we can't even  start our cars  can we  no  and this guy's  talking about  cutting doors  or something  that's way beyond  our grasp  way out of my league  well it's not that hard  I just run a  fucking computer machine  it tells me how to  put the shit in  I do it  I don't know  no one else can do it  around here as well  I don't know why  you're sick of him  E-Rock  it's fucking easy 
[03:52:30]  E-Rock is just  sighing  no this story  just goes nowhere  no tell us more  about the CNC machine  hey man  is it a music factory  I could show up there  and do better than Sal  I'm sure  you think so  I'd need a little bit  of training  obviously  I think we actually  Sal we do have  Luke's  latest piece  that he sent in  E-Rock you're pulling  that up right  oh boy  I wonder who  it's going to be  directed towards  wait I don't think 
[03:53:00]  I got that  the CNC  you know  he was talking  about the CNC machine  oh  wow it's not  where's Sal  I thought he was  supposed to make one  he rocks on the same  wavelength as me  right now Troy  I'm looking for it  it's not  not the one I wanted  at least  everybody got it  it's all timing  isn't it  yeah  okay  I said it to Travis  the other day  I don't know  I'm going to hang up  on Luke  I'm tired of talking  he's going to call back  I know he is  they all do  they all do it  who  all the fans  who need to get through  you know 
[03:53:30]  Alex  Alex in Jacksonville  hey how you doing  well I was good  but Luke bored me  well I got some  I have some  some tips  to help  get the show back  a little more  how's that  well yeah  it's  it's tough to change  yeah  as far as you've got  alright I can't do it  not after Luke  I can't do it  I love the phones dude  it's great  I can't do it  not after him  not after him 
[03:54:00]  I was proud  I'll tell you what  I was proud of today  what I learned  is that Rob Cross  has a nice set of balls  on him  not to look at  Rob killed it today  I thought it was awesome  he did very well  huh  you know  it takes a lot  because  I gave Opie a CD  this morning  and I said  Rob Cross has issued  an apology  for yesterday  and your grievances  with the Steven Singer  live read mess up  and Opie looked at me  with the condescending look  that he gives to management  and he goes  oh did he do a bit  or something like that  you know 
[03:54:30]  he didn't want to hear  Rob Cross doing a bit  because he's like  you know  I just want you to get it  fucking right  and then leave me alone  be out of my life  right  yeah  so Rob Cross comes across  and he wrote this  by the way  yeah  well I didn't write it for him  Troy didn't write it for him  he came up  I told him  you know  I did tell him  you should have an apology  and he went  oh yeah yeah  I know I know  he wrote it up  I read it  I said this is great  I didn't edit it at all  he went into the booth  we put some music on it 
[03:55:00]  and that was it  this is all him  this is all Chuck Roast  and this is why  you could tell  Chuck Roast  was on the verge  of taking over  West Coast radio  at one point  Chuck Roast  was the biggest personality  in the West Coast  is that right  yeah  yeah on K-Rock  that's right  I don't know what  he decided to go down  a different path  and he ended up  in management  but it's obvious to me  that Chuck Roast  was and still may be  the future of broadcasting  because it takes  a lot to get these guys 
[03:55:30]  to laugh  at a bit for management  Rob's a funny dude  and Rob did it  I'll play it in a second  I think he's trying  to separate himself  racist Mike  yeah  good morning boys  quickly  if Luke is better than Sal  I'm better than Luke  I start tomorrow  alright you're on  we'll hire you  sorry Sal  you're out of a gig  I like the other guy's  name better anyway  racist Mike  at least he's got  a little character to it  right  alright yeah  and you're right  I would also like to know 
[03:56:00]  what your opinion  of Rob's handiwork  on this was  do you want it  before or after  I'll play it  I'll play it  this is Rob's apology  from yesterday  I Chuck Roast  would like to  sincerely apologize  just that he called  himself Chuck Roast  I mean there you go  you just defused a bomb  you just  and everybody  Jim's right  and Jim pointed this out  other people in management  should take note  Rob Cross comes in here  he defuses a bomb  he makes them laugh  we move on  yeah but  they're not as  well 
[03:56:30]  I'll let you bite your tongue  on that one  I won't ask any follow ups  to Stephen Singer  the host of the  Opie and Anthony show  and its vast audience  for failing to address  serious issues  with Stephen's live copy  when it first came  to my attention  on the morning of  February 5th  I take very seriously  the needs and expectations  of our clients  sales staff  and the professionals  whose job it is  to deliver these  valuable messages  the account executives  who first receive the copy  and earn commission  on each and every spot  that their sole client places 
[03:57:00]  on the platform's  biggest and most popular show  expect better  and I apologize  the army of employees  in the SiriusXM  traffic department  whose job it is  to review client copy  as they cut and paste it  into email for distribution  deserve better  did you guys start  picking up on the sarcasm yet?  E-Rock?  it's accurate  and I apologize  the ONA staff  all of whom receive  review  and print client copy  each and every  they hit you there Sal  you got it?  I got it  you started picking up there  okay 
[03:57:30]  every morning  are incredibly busy  there are only six of you  you deserve better  and I apologize  to all involved  the 12 to 14 people  who have the opportunity  to see copy  before it gets to the host  did the sarcasm  hit you yet Troy?  oh yeah  you gotcha huh?  yeah  yep  but especially  to our biggest  and often only client  Steven Singer  I shamefully regret  my lack of urgent action  I would like to take  this opportunity  to reaffirm  and redouble my efforts  to more aggressively 
[03:58:00]  seek out  and rectify  the mistakes  of the many  many  many  others  involved in the process  Steven Singer  just picked up on it  with that one  I mean  it's Eric's wife's account  the commission on these spots  pay for his sweet  Simpsons memorabilia collection  Harry Potter Lego sets  his pro wrestling action figures  and his crippling  hoagie addiction  accurate  he runs the board  knows which spots  are about to be read  and he's the last line  of defense  before anything  goes out over the air  not accurate  he can't afford 
[03:58:30]  to have his gravy train  derailed  most likely  if his jeep  wouldn't have broken  and if he weren't  too stupid to fix it  or call AAA  as soon as there was  a problem  on the morning  of February 6th  he would have caught  and corrected  this egregious air  well before the show  in summation  I wholeheartedly  apologize to our  respected client  Steven Singer  for Eric's gross  negligence  it is my hope  that you will look  past his uselessness  and buffoonery  and continue to be  a valued part  of the O.B. and Anthony  show for years to come 
[03:59:00]  thank you  Rob Cross everybody  Chuck Roast  aka Rob Cross  that was funny  representing middle management  as best anybody could do  Iraqi apologized  on your behalf  that was nice at the end  yeah see that's where  it kind of trails off  from being accurate  you didn't like it as much  when he started  no I think this  this whole thing  was very well done  very well written  and you know  kudos to him  for doing this  but  towards the end  I think he just goes 
[03:59:30]  I'll just blame  Iraq for this  well he's smart  and this is Rob Cross's  genius  he's smart enough  to know that  just in case  I haven't won  them over yet  if I can sneak in  a couple references  to Iraq being a buffoon  Iraq eating tons of sandwiches  and Iraq collecting toys  guaranteed laughs  how do you think  that's accurate  how do you think  I made a career for myself  Iraq  um  you know  we all gotta get over somehow  like stepping on the heads  of others  I did that didn't I  yes  and I still do every day 
[04:00:00]  and I'll continue to do so  but Rob was smart  in that he did that  you gotta be happy  cause the way I think  about it Iraq  is that  Rob is making something  like that  and he's got a decision  he knows  he's gotta get himself over  and the only way  to do it  a year ago  would have been  to smash Iraq  now you got Sal  on your side  Iraq  in my mind  if you wanna get over  you either smash  Iraq or you smash  Sal  I think you're in  that camp now  Sal  what do you think 
[04:00:30]  yeah yeah  definitely  Iraq  does that relieve you  not really  no  it's unfortunate  but on the other hand  you know  thank god  there's someone else  to carry some of this  don't say it  yeah Iraq  you're giving it  set me up  put that ball on the tee  well what else  am I supposed to do here  that's my job  there's no easy way out  no  like you  fitting through a door  see that's not necessary  what I was trying to say was  it makes life easier  for you though  because now 
[04:01:00]  it used to be  the chain of deflection  like I try to position myself  as high up as I can  so I can deflect  in various directions  and as you get lower down the chain  it becomes more and more difficult  to deflect  you used to not have a place to deflect  because everything ended with you  you were the bottom of it  now  I feel like you can effectively  deflect itself  I was deflecting even when  I was at that  you were trying  no  based on from where  we started with satellite  to now  I can deflect everything 
[04:01:30]  pretty easily  but now  it's interesting to have  a different route  where it's not coming  straight at me  right  and you can go like  well Sal sucks  and they'll be like  you know what  E-Rock  you make a good point  whereas it used to be  the rest of us  would be like  E-Rock sucks  and they'd be like  yeah let's talk about that  for a while  and we'd go  whew  now  that'll get us to 10  exactly  and then we forget about  what are we mad at Troy for  who cares  who cares  yeah it's Friday  E-Rock  you're so fat  and you'd go  yes  yes I am  and then in the hallway 
[04:02:00]  you know I didn't mean that  right  uh-huh  sure  that's  is that uh  is that Greg Hughes talking  no that's everybody  oh  they all three of them do that  ah you're great  you're a good sport  yeah  they ever do that to you Sal  you know I didn't mean it  you're a good sport  maybe once or twice  not as much  that's not encouraging  not as much  John in Texas  has a what did you learn  well yes  that Sam Roberts  is a broadcasting genius  for one  true  and Sam can I ask you a question  yeah  where  what show can you go to

[04:06:00]  and we'll give  you the address  why don't you  send the tickets  here and we'll  either find some  people here  or give them  away to listeners  or something  that would be great  awesome  thank you  Emily  you're welcome  you're very sexy  I am now  that's a little  heterosexuality  does that  off tip anything  not really  it doesn't  because there was  so much  so much gay  so much of it  so far in gay zone  yeah  like I would need  Emily in here  nude  putting the tickets  up her box  or something like that  yeah  and I don't have that 
[04:06:30]  I just have her  on the phone  with a winter jacket on  she needs Emily  and all her friends  to come blow everybody  yeah  is that what you're  looking for  a blowjob  see this is  the problem  with Troy  is that we're  like okay  what are your  ideas  and he says  stuff like that  well why don't  we get some  strippers in here  and they could  just blow us  for a while  no I've given  plenty of ideas  like what  doing like  Crisco Twister  with  with penthouse girls  I wish we could  I wish we could do  that  we did  money honey  and stuff like  that at the  other studio  I don't know  where we do it  here  we could  what about  the other room 
[04:07:00]  where we did  they won't let us  do it there  we did a cherry  darts in there  yeah but it's  not as messy  as the money  honey  just put tarps  down  we could do  Crisco Twister  in the other room  definitely  yeah  I mean  I've presented  that idea  multiple times  and it just  kind of goes  because I think  they don't want  to say yes to it  alright well  let's make it happen  who wants  who doesn't want  to say yes to it  whoever you're asking  if it just keeps  going to the wayside  I'm guessing  they're like  we don't want  to do this  it's going to be  too big a mess  I'll bet we can do  Crisco Twister  but I just don't 
[04:07:30]  think they'll let it  a twister board  and a bunch of tarps  yeah  and when we just  booked the room  that we did  cherry darts in  yeah  that's done  four strippers  well it's done  with the staff  it has to go to  it has to go to  the hosts  they don't want to do it  here's what we'll do  Troy we'll gay them  up so much  they'll say whatever  they'll say yes  to any girl idea  I don't know  I don't know  about that  I'll get it by  I'm a professional  look  we gotta go
