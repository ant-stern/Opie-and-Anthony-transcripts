<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing relief that the Presidential election was over, choosing to avoid political news in favor of movies like *Dirty Harry* and reality television.  The conversation quickly shifted to the devastating snowstorm on Long Island and the ensuing chaos.  They launched into a furious tirade against LIPA, filled with highly offensive language, detailing the widespread power outages and fuel shortages, the slow response to the crisis, and the extensive damage ten days after the storm. Numerous callers shared their own harrowing experiences, including one who recounted trading sex for gas via Craigslist ads.  Other callers offered various perspectives: an electrician explained the high cost of underground power lines, a Con Edison employee clarified their prioritization of power restoration and debunked rumors, and another caller revealed a FEMA official's firing for diverting crews to their own home.  The hosts, alongside callers, expressed extreme frustration with the perceived inaction of elected officials, interspersed with jokes that frequently employed racial slurs and offensive stereotypes.  The segment concluded with continued outrage at LIPA's incompetence and the ongoing crisis.

The show then transitioned to a critique of Mayor Bloomberg's handling of post-hurricane cleanup in New York City, specifically targeting the perceived neglect of boroughs outside Manhattan.  They discussed the cancelled marathon and the removal of its infrastructure.  A caller, a county lineman, complained about out-of-state crews being paid significantly more than local workers, resulting in slower restoration efforts.  This led to a broader discussion on the tendency of people to claim responsibility without action, prompting a humorous suggestion of public spanking as a punishment.  The show announced the arrival of comedy guests Russell Peters and Billy Connolly, and played a brief, humorous street interview with a person in costume.  Numerous entries from their audio contest, featuring vulgar language and offensive humor often targeting specific groups, were then played.  Notable entries included songs about "the Radio Wizard," "Iraq," and a rap criticizing show management.  A drunk caller, Drew, initially called to complain about the hosts' mockery of Southerners' reactions to snow, but the conversation turned into a friendly exchange about shared power outage experiences.  More audio contest entries and continued discussion of the power outages followed, before Russell Peters joined the show.  The hosts engaged in a conversation with Peters about his career and wealth, including a humorous anecdote about his Bentley purchase, culminating in a detailed description of his black American Express Centurion card.

The next segment focused heavily on Russell Peters' upcoming performances, particularly at the Barclays Center. The conversation became intensely sexually explicit, featuring graphic descriptions of genitalia and sexual acts.  Jay Moore and Joe DeRosa were mentioned, though not in studio.  The conversation also covered Peters' personal life, including his divorce and its financial ramifications. Billy Connolly then joined the show, discussing his role in *The Hobbit*, his stand-up career, and the differences between performing in the US and the Middle East, including censorship and encounters with authorities. They also discussed the recent election results.  The segment concluded with scheduling information for upcoming performances.

The following segment continued the sexually explicit theme, with Billy Connolly recounting a past sexual encounter involving urine and panties. This sparked further discussion of unusual sexual preferences, prison rape, and the varying reactions to such topics.  The hosts discussed unusual sexual practices, including "earth fucking," and the difficulties of discussing prison rape, particularly in relation to a previous guest, Damien Echols. The conversation then shifted to Connolly's career, including his comedy albums and collaborations with Jerry Rafferty. He shared an anecdote about meeting Zamfir's ex-wife, leading to a discussion about the pan flute.  He recounted a physical altercation with a heckler who shouted a racial slur, which led to a broader discussion of hecklers, fighting, and boxing, including anecdotes about Connolly's boxing experiences and a near-altercation between his wife and Mike Tyson.  The segment concluded with plugs for upcoming performances by Connolly, Peters, and Moore, and a Leonard Cohen song.

The final segment featured Sam Roberts hosting an "After ONA Live" segment with Jay Moore.  They bantered about the studio setup and discussed a funny YouTube video of a person dressed as E.T. driving.  They then discussed their own YouTube success, with Sam highlighting a highly viewed video and Jay mentioning a less successful one.  The conversation turned to anecdotes about Jay's family, including his uncle Dan and aunt Christy.  Sam discussed his experience filling in for other radio hosts and his podcast, comparing his podcast style to his appearances on the Opie and Anthony show. Jay reflected on his evolution as a podcast host. The segment concluded with the arrival of Josh Peck, who promoted his new movie, *Red Dawn*.  The conversation included discussions of Twitter, Peck's career, and further anecdotes about Jay's children and parenting. The segment ended with plugs for Peck's movie and Stephen Singer Jewelers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's do it!  Oh my god. Good morning everyone.  It's been...  You've had it, huh?  Dude.  The election's over. You should be calm.  Well, election is... election ishmection.  I, uh...  Can I say really fast?  I know where you're going and it's gonna be wonderful and it's gonna take us on a nice little ride.  Are you relieved the election's over?  Like, last night, I didn't watch politics and it was like so nice. 
[00:00:30]  The hell is that?  That phone.  Oh my god, this is like a horror movie!  Don't answer it.  Don't answer it.  Hello?  Mars, what are you doing?  Mars, what happened?  Explain your incompetence, Mars.  Can we answer it?  Dude, we're in the middle of broadcasting.  Can we answer it?  That scared the shit out of me.  How many movies start like that?  Were you looking for another horrible product, uh, pun t-shirt, uh, MMA t-shirt? 
[00:01:00]  Well, you should have been shutting that off.  Well, no, actually, I was, uh, fixing the phones today and I left that volume on.  Wait, whoops.  Wait, is that a phone call?  For us?  Yes.  Ooh, wow.  Who do you think it was?  I wonder if it was an opportunity.  Wow.  I thought it was the start, the start of Screamer, one of those fucking alarm movies.  It was, right?  I thought it was my cell phone and I'm like, that's not your cell phone, dummy.  Yeah, yeah, I pulled out, I was like, maybe an alarm going on.  Creepy.  I don't know.  Anyway, really, it was like so refreshing not, like, I went and did the exact same thing 
[00:01:30]  I usually do.  I really do, I watch MSNBC, CNN and Fox and I just, I just keep rotating and I started  and I'm like, eh, eh, and then all of a sudden CNN had a little piece on the, uh, the snowstorm  we're all dealing with, which we'll say to you, and I'm like, ooh, I can watch this,  but anything political, I'm like, I don't give a fuck, it's over.  Couldn't deal with it.  I've been a news junkie for months and months with this election, and then yesterday I get 
[00:02:00]  home and, uh, I started and I'm like, why am I doing this?  And I turned on, uh, fucking, uh, uh, Dirty Harry, Magnum Force.  Oh, there you go.  I watched some fucking old 70s, uh, action movie shit.  It was great.  I watched The Housewives of Beverly Hills.  Oh.  Um, but also.  I did.  I don't know why, but I guess it was just to kind of.  Decompress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To wash out the brain.  Decompress.  Because there was nothing going on there.  I, like, I don't want to know Aaron Burnett's name.  I don't want to know these people's names. 
[00:02:30]  I'm done.  I don't want to, I don't want to look out at Candy Crowley anymore and make fat jokes.  No.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Fuck.  I was on Twitter last night and, uh, actually even yesterday afternoon and I'm going through,  uh, the tweets and I see like, Hey Anthony, blah, blah, blah.  And you know, it's political.  And I hit the retweet with comment and, and I start and I just went like, no.  Yeah.  Why am I bothering?  So I just clicked off it and block.  Now any, any comment that I would have had now just turns into block. 
[00:03:00]  I was, yeah.  Add it.  I don't even know if I, I guess I, did I tweet?  Oh, I tweet.  I tweet a picture of us, a group picture from that fun show yesterday.  And then started a rumor about Mitt Romney that everyone paused.  It's so obvious, obvious a joke.  I said, you know, adding insult to injury.  Uh, they just audited Mitt Romney and people believe that.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  I'm like, no, it's a dumb joke.  Why are you believing that?  Yeah.  It's a dumb joke.  But there is some, uh, some, uh, homeboy site that has, uh, comments that I guess they, 
[00:03:30]  they heard our show and heard me going off and there's pages and pages and pages of comments  about, uh, the show, us, me, racism, all that shit.  What do you mean us?  Don't they, please separate the voices.  You know how it is.  Please separate the voices.  There's no way in hell, you know how idiotic people are and they can't separate one thing  from another.  I've tried so many times and I always say it's me.  It's not you guys.  Uh, Anthony Cooney is speaking, but they always get it confused. 
[00:04:00]  Although you, you didn't take much shit.  Jimmy took some shit, but then I, I was just, I guess they, uh, they listened to the rant  from yesterday's show, the first like hour, the first break where I just completely go  off on Obama and black people and everything.  And, um, I guess they don't want me to have, uh, my first amendment, right.  You know, freedom of speech.  Uh, so they were like, I can't believe, is this on the radio?  Yeah, it's on the radio. 
[00:04:30]  It's my opinion on things.  It's how I feel.  And I was stating it.  Uh, why, why, why wouldn't I be able to do that?  I wasn't inciting anything.  I wasn't, uh, uh, I wasn't even using any, uh, foul language.  Why did I get shit?  I don't know.  They just think you're an asshole.  I don't recognize the voice.  You're too white.  By the way, I learned something new.  I learned something new.  Thank you.  Yes.  Black people, uh, are calling white people CACs.  C-A-C-S for Caucasians. 
[00:05:00]  We're CACs.  Oh, that's kind of nice.  We're CACs, yeah.  They're like, motherfucking CACs can't take that, uh, uh, black man run, running thing.  CACs.  I so don't.  I, can I, let me tell you something.  I got a word that beats the shit out of CACs for you people.  What is it?  Oh boy, I use it all the time.  Let my voice be heard.  I so don't give a fuck that a black guy is in office.  I just don't care.  Right.  On any fucking level.  Yeah.  As long as he's not banging a chick, I want to bang.  That's all I care about.  Election's over.  I don't care.  He's four years.  He's in there. 
[00:05:30]  Good.  I didn't, I don't care that he got reelected and I, I wouldn't have cared if he didn't.  I don't fucking care.  But you can't convince people.  Like the dumb guy called yesterday and said that, uh, I said to say like, Hey, I don't care.  No, you're a liar.  Like what?  I don't care.  But that's people don't, even when you say that, people hear it and they don't, it doesn't  resonate because it doesn't help prove their point that you're a racist.  Guess what?  I'm one of the lucky ones.  My, my life didn't change at all in the last four years.  Okay.  I have family members.  Their lives changed drastically.  Was it because of Obama in office? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  Well, but as I sit here, I can't think of one thing that changed in the last four years  in my life because we had a black president period.  I don't care.  Fuck.  Where were we?  Oh yeah.  Just talking about that.  Oh, the storm and blowing off politics, which is very refreshing.  I think these news channels are going to be in trouble, huh?  Well, they're going to take a big dip now in the ratings.  Because it's been 18 months.  It started 18 months ago on this level.  Yeah.  And then what happens to Mitt Romney? 
[00:06:30]  He just kind of goes off into the, into his life.  Does he live wherever Dukakis lives?  You all, you think all the people have to go to an island?  Go to an island.  I think Dukakis lives on this island.  I think Mitt Romney is now going to join him.  You think?  Yeah, well, I think Mitt Romney is one of these guys that will completely disappear.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're right.  You know, every once in a while you get one of these guys.  Like, John McCain did not disappear.  He lost, but he didn't disappear.  John Kerry did not disappear.  Al Gore did not disappear, though. 
[00:07:00]  I think this is the first one in a while where you see him completely disappear.  I know he's going to take a massive break, that's for sure, from all this shit.  Imagine 18 months of this shit, and then you lose.  You just want to fucking go away.  And he's looked at as a loser.  The little I did watch, the Republicans are kind of separating themselves a little bit,  but that seems pretty normal.  Yeah.  But you can't look at the guy as a loser.  He pretty much got half the country.  Half the vote.  It was very close. 
[00:07:30]  But in their world, that's a loser.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't that weird?  It is.  He didn't do the job.  He didn't get the job done.  Well, whatever.  But it was good to maybe watch a little bit, I guess I have to admit, too.  In general, I didn't spend two, three hours a night like I've been doing, especially lately.  And to tell you the truth, when I wanted to know about the storm that was coming,  I didn't even put on Fox or CNN or anything like that.  I went right to the Weather Channel because I didn't want to hear any other shit aside from the weather.  So I went there and heard the early forecast. 
[00:08:00]  I'm going to interrupt you one last time, and then I'll shut the fuck up.  CAC actually means cracker, ass cracker.  Oh, really?  Yeah, not Caucasian.  I thought it was Caucasian.  No.  A lot of people say it's cracker, ass cracker.  I read Caucasian last night, but okay.  I'll buy that, too.  So anyway, Weather Channel.  It doesn't mean anything.  I'll shut up.  Go ahead.  No, I went to the Weather Channel, and early on, all the forecasts were going to be very windy.  We've got a nor'easter coming into the area that was affected by Sandy.  And, you know, high winds, some rain, maybe mixed with some wet snow for the day and into the night. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, okay, sounds good.  It fucking blizzarded.  It blizzarded it out.  It was unbelievable.  The wind, the heavy, heavy wet snow, not mixed with rain, it was fucking snowing out.  And trees around my house that are left, the snow was so heavy, they're, as Danny said, driving in, banana peeled down. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  Like, I have trees in my front yard.  They're not big trees, but they're, you know, front yard trees.  Right.  They're bent down to the ground.  Wow.  One of them is stretched over my front stoop.  Wow.  Like, it's just, everything flattened out.  It's just the weirdest thing, because, like, we've had snow in the area, of course, plenty of times, but I've never quite seen, I've never seen that before.  It was, it was heavy snow.  Wow.  And there's still leaves on the trees.  Right.  So, it hits all that weight. 
[00:09:30]  They all just fucking bent over.  And then Danny was driving to my house with Travis this morning to drive in with me, and his car got stuck on my street.  I made it the whole way, and then the second I turned onto, onto the block, it was just impassable.  Yeah.  He got stuck, and then we all left in the Escalade, and we were cracking up.  It was like a video game.  There was no straight parts on the road to drive on, and then we just kept coming across tree after tree that was right across the road. 
[00:10:00]  Like, E-Rock would have called in 20 times that way that he wasn't coming in.  He's just shaking his head.  It was, so, so, you know how many times we had this conversation in the truck?  It was like, do you think I can make that?  I can go around it.  I'm going to go around.  It's tight, but I'm going to do it.  There was one instance where you were trying to get between, like, a tree and, like, a utility pole.  Yeah.  And you came so close on the driver's side that I was convinced.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, all right, we're going to move.  It's going to, the car's going to shift, and I'm going to hear, ka-dong-dong. 
[00:10:30]  And then there's going to be a huge dent in the side of his car.  No, it was about a half an inch on that side.  There was no clearance.  In between, it was on somebody's property, too, someone's front fucking lawn.  And then another one had to go up on somebody's grass, well, it's snow, but, and come down.  And then we're getting on the parkway on-ramp, and all of a sudden, a mountain of snow comes off of the roof of my truck and slides onto the windshield.  Like, ah, it was a video game.  Jesus.  It was crazy. 
[00:11:00]  So, a shitload of trees down on Long Island again.  A fuckload of trees.  And people still don't have their power, like yourself.  I'm not sure what's worse, though.  Do you have power?  No.  So, you're up to ten days.  I want to keep track of this.  Ten days, no power.  I'm not sure what's worse, though, because I don't have power, haven't had power, no inkling of ever getting power back at this point.  But some people got their power back yesterday.  In the area?  And had it fucking go out again because of the snow.  Of course.  And what would be worse, cleaning up all your shit, your extension cords, putting away your generator, all that shit, because you got lights on, and then having it go out again. 
[00:11:30]  Of course.  It's unbelievable.  It just doesn't seem right that the power should be out for ten days.  In these areas where, you know.  That's something that's very hard for anyone to do anything about.  It's LIPA.  They're going to work at their fucking pace.  I fucking, I started off giving them the benefit of the doubt, but ten days in my area is, there's no excuse for it.  They suck.  They fucking suck.  They're terrible.  LIPA can suck a dick. 
[00:12:00]  Fuck them.  I haven't seen a truck in my area.  I understand the mains got to be put up or whatever.  How about you fix the lines in my area and put a new pole in and a transformer so when the mains do go up, it's fucking fixed over there.  I haven't seen one truck in my area.  Not a fucking one.  Every tree, every wire that was down in my area is still down exactly the way it was on day one of the storm.  Every fucking one of them.  And you're not in the wilderness.  No.  I'm in the highest taxed area in the country.  Wow.  That's ridiculous. 
[00:12:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Un-fucking-believable.  It doesn't have any power.  I got no power.  People don't have power.  But here's something they can do something about that I'm fucking stupefied.  The gasoline situation in this state, in Long Island, and that.  And please hold your drive to fucking Colorado for gas.  We got plenty here.  Assholes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, you gotta come to Connecticut.  I'm not driving to Connecticut.  Why?  It's an easy ride. 
[00:13:00]  No.  It's an easy ride.  It's not.  There's not a lot of traffic between you and Connecticut.  Oh, my God.  I-95 is a nightmare.  You don't think that's a convenient trip on Christian gas?  Oh, God.  Go to Hartford.  Idiots.  You know how many times we've driven I-95 through Connecticut?  It's one long fucking rush hour.  So, I mean, why aren't they just- why aren't there convoys of tanker trucks from areas where there is fuel driving to our fucking area?  Why the fuck aren't there- why are we looking at convoys of tanker trucks coming into this area? 
[00:13:30]  Ten days later, every gas station you pass is- is as a emergency tape and cones up because they're closed.  The only ones you do see that are open have fucking lines that you can't believe how long they are.  You know why?  Because the people that are in charge can't take care of us.  Exactly.  That's why I don't believe in conspiracy theories.  They can't even figure out the easy shit.  Come on, Obama.  You hate white people, don't you?  No, no, no, no.  We're over that.  We're over that.  We're good. 
[00:14:00]  We're good for a while.  You make such a good point, man.  It's like all of the little details that would have had to have gone into, like, 9-11.  Yeah.  And then one hurricane and we can't get gas for three weeks.  Right.  In the end, they're just regular idiots like ourselves that want to slack as much as possible and keep your job.  Exactly.  That's exactly what happens with every single fucking person out there.  That's it.  Of course we should have gas 10 days after a super storm.  In this area especially.  Of course.  Y'all are fucking babies. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, Drew from Bama, you're the sacrificial lamb today.  Enjoy the show somewhere else.  Bye-bye, Drew.  Bye-bye, asshole.  Bye-bye, Drew.  You never know what I'm looking.  But let's break the...  How are we babies?  There was a super storm.  Like, people don't have power 10 days later.  That's insane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's completely insane.  These are like regular suburbs.  They're not in the middle of nowhere where it's hard to get to.  And believe me, if it was a genuine apocalypse where we'd have to go out hunting and fucking 
[00:15:00]  murderous marauders were running around, it wouldn't hear me griping because I understand  that.  Well, they should just...  I don't understand that there's a power company that's supposed to come in and fix this shit  and they're not there.  We're going to do Anarchy Radio today.  I'm feeling it, man.  Oh, my God.  Believe me.  I'm fucking...  We're close to martial law.  If they would just announce martial law, then it would be a lot easier to get your shit.  I want...  Why aren't they doing that with tankers?  That's a good question.  ...conga lines of fucking tanker trucks driving into our...  Because...  Where the expressway...  Instead of gas lines off of the parkway and expressway, you see fucking taillights of 
[00:15:30]  tanker trucks going to various gas stations, filling them up, and keep it coming.  I'm going to answer Jimmy's question, because we don't have our shit set up right.  And now we've been caught with our fucking pants down.  This is what happens.  This is what happens.  And I'll tell you another thing I'm not seeing.  A lot of tanker trucks on the road.  I'm not saying...  You know when you drive on the expressway and you usually look up and you see like a  big gas tanker truck?  I'm not seeing these fucking things.  Yeah, I don't know what that's about. 
[00:16:00]  Do you want to know that I slept really nice with the AC on again yesterday?  Because the heat's really fucking blasting.  I know a lot of people that have, Opie, because they tweet me relentlessly that they're fun.  Last night I tweeted, okay, I get it.  Wow.  One of my favorite phone calls, it was either yesterday or the day before.  Everyone gives a shit.  I just showed my town.  Highest snowfall out of the entire area affected by this.  How many inches?  Eight inches.  You got eight inches out there?  Which I know isn't a lot of snow, I know. 
[00:16:30]  But on the heels of a fucking devastating hurricane where trees are weakened and down and no power  and stuff, it stinks.  It's eight inches of heavy snow.  Yeah.  That's very different.  We got about two or three, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  In the city.  But anyway, one of my favorite calls was the guy who said he gave a shit about everybody  until his power goes on.  Until his power came on.  And then it's like, ah, fuck those people.  Man, I don't give a shit.  But I think that's how we are as humans, right?  Oh, fucking yeah.  Humans.  Exactly.  Newman.  But.  He was, this was, I still have a lot of, I still have a lot of roots on Long Island and 
[00:17:00]  it just drives me nuts because I have a lot of family members without power still too.  It's just unbelievable that this could happen.  Ten days?  We never went ten days growing up.  I know.  Life is enraging.  We might have went three or four days, I think.  Just enraging.  Crazy.  My power went out for about an hour yesterday.  Wow.  Yeah, I had to put my beer outside.  It was fucking nuts.  Fucking devastating.  Damn, man.  Devastating.  So, what do you think the issue is? 
[00:17:30]  They got spanked that hard or.  They did get spanked hard.  Or do they just suck?  I have a.  Or is it a combination of the two?  I have an insider.  Ooh.  And his texts have gotten progressively more crazy and just like, like hopeless.  Like at first, it's like, we're on the job.  Wait a minute.  We got that bad.  And the last one was like, I'm sorry.  He turned it.  He actually turned into the mayor from Jaws.  No, really?  At the hospital.  I said, but I was doing what's best for the town. 
[00:18:00]  My son was at that beach too.  He said, he sent you a note, uh, uh, the, the charges against me.  It was a Colonel Kurtz.  Sell the, sell the house.  Sell the kids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not coming back.  That's exactly what his texts have become.  It started out like, we're on the job.  I'll keep you posted.  Very devastated area.  A lot of lines down.  We're trying that.  And then it's like, all right, well, we'll get some.  Well, the damage a lot worse than we thought.  Okay.  We're still working on it. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Got a work order on my desk.  I got, and then it just turned into, Hey, I'm, I'm sorry.  I, you know, mismanagement.  I don't even know.  I can't.  It's by me.  I'm not even going to defeat you.  One of the tweets were, one of his texts were, I'm not even going to try to defend these  people anymore.  Oh, wow.  He just gave up.  And it's like, can you fix my generator?  I, I dreamt of a snail slithering over the edge of a straight shirt.  What are you talking about?  He's going to be asking you for a job soon.  Oh, I thank God.  I took the initiative to wire in my heat though. 
[00:19:00]  For the, uh, into the generator because it was fucking cold last night and snowing  like crazy.  And I would have, I wouldn't have been able to stay there.  It's just unbelievable.  You guys have power, right?  You're bad in Jersey.  Yeah, we do.  How about like Hoboken and places like that?  Yeah.  Uh, the, yeah, they didn't have a big problem.  It was just, uh, water and getting people out of buildings.  Okay.  Well, Cory Booker was saying 28,000 people.  Is that in his area or is that for all of New Jersey?  That's probably Newark.  Just in that area is 28,000 people without electricity still? 
[00:19:30]  That would make sense.  Cory Booker is the mayor of Newark, I think.  There's a lot more in Jersey that are still out.  Okay.  And then the nor'easter cut power to 59,000 more Long Islanders.  More people last night.  Yeah.  That's people that had power or had power restored and now it's gone.  Look, all you have to do is travel around the country and see no fucking, um, you know,  power lines.  Yeah.  And you always would go back to Long Island or Jersey going, why the fuck are we still  doing this?  Yeah.  It's so quaint, isn't it?  And, and, you know, and, and, and they knew eventually they were going to get spanked really 
[00:20:00]  hard with this shit.  Yeah.  But is there a plan in the future to now try to move some of this stuff underground?  I doubt it.  I've heard from people that what LIPA does is they go out, put absolute minimum band-aids  on everything.  And then throughout the year or in between huge storms, they pick areas and go back and,  and legitimately fix these things the way they're supposed to be like fixed. 
[00:20:30]  Sure.  But the band-aids are all over the fucking place and they fail.  They, you know, poles come down, fucking transformers blow up.  It's the fact that it's 10 days in my fucking area is there's no excuse for it.  None.  No.  Cause I mean, we all know they try to take care of the, uh, the wealthier areas.  The wealthy area.  I mean, I'll fucking, I mean, that is how it's on in wine dance, but it's on in fucking  Brentwood. 
[00:21:00]  Well, maybe they didn't get hit with the storm.  Well, maybe they didn't.  If you pay the highest taxes, you feel you didn't notice that old guy.  Your light should be on first.  If you pay the highest taxes, how does that make sense?  If you spend the most money and you pay the most into the government and then you don't  get your lights on for 10 days, that's why people complain about high taxes.  Right.  Like if you paid the highest taxes in the country and when your lights went out, they  were on first.  Right.  It would be easier to swallow paying more taxes. 
[00:21:30]  That's what Obama misses.  If you're going to say, do your fair share and pay more, then give the services faster.  Yeah.  I'm paying for something.  Right.  Take a little off the top with your taxes this year.  A little off the top because that'll work as I take a little off my house.  Well, you've been bothered.  So, you know, now they should be bothered.  They don't.  Oh, that's right.  That doesn't work at all ever in your favor.  No, no, ever, ever, ever.  What am I getting for my money?  Like, like you're and people will bitch, you know, why should you get special treatment? 
[00:22:00]  I'm paying more.  I should get something for it.  Right.  If you pay more for a car, you get a better car.  But more importantly, I think you're talking for everyone.  Yeah.  I mean, you're in a higher tax area, of course, but a lot of people think the same  way as you.  If they don't have their power for 10 days, they're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  You know, I'm doing everyone thinks they're doing their share.  So why am I not getting the service, you know, in return?  Right.  We all will all take two or three days without power.  I mean, 10 days is ridiculous. 
[00:22:30]  I think I've been very tolerant.  They should pass out generators or something until they figure it out.  But 10 days and it's 10 days with no fucking vision that this is getting fixed anytime soon.  So nothing has been done in my neighborhood that would lead me to believe that it's going  to be any faster than it was yesterday.  So what do they need to do in your neighborhood to get your power on?  Fucking get the trees off the power lines that are still down.  They really like to take pictures of this. 
[00:23:00]  It's fucking.  This is the shit you should be tweeting.  It's astounding.  I want to see it.  Yeah, you should Twitter that.  That might help.  It's still down.  Do they have to get new poles in the ground and all that?  I would gather there's snapped poles around.  There's fucking.  But, you know, that's, I guess, part of the goddamn job.  Uh, but, but not even, not even trees cut off of these power lines is what I'm talking  about.  They're still there.  They're still leaning.  They're on smashed on the ground with wood all over the place.  They haven't even cleaned up. 
[00:23:30]  Like it's not even dude.  I looked at, it looks like a, like a snapshot.  Every time I drive past it in the morning, there's snap telephone pole trees with branches  scattered all over the place and wires tangled in it.  And it's still there 10 fucking days later.  Wow.  The fuck's going on?  And between my neighbor, my backyard neighbor and my house, there's a giant tree down in  his yard with a snap pole with the, uh, our electric for the houses in our immediate  area, um, with a transformer on it laying on the ground, wires torn out. 
[00:24:00]  And then the next pole with a transformer on it is so taut that it's bending and the transformer  is half ripped off of that pole.  And no one's been by.  So you're not getting power for another four days.  Exactly.  Yes.  You know this.  I know this.  Holy fuck.  Take pictures of that.  It's devastated.  You should take pictures of that.  The attorney general is going after people too, who are price gouging.  Right.  On Craigslist.  Uh, I don't have as much of a problem on Craigslist as I do in stores do it. 
[00:24:30]  Cause Craigslist is just a bunch of fucking average assholes.  Yeah.  And that's the, they should be going after them, but not first, but go after guys who  are, when stores and hotels are doing it and cabs, but, uh, yeah, they went to Craigslist  to try to get, um, them to turn over names to really go after people for fucking charging  a hundred dollars for a gallon of gas.  Unbelievable.  It's just unbelievable.  They got to have some kind of system in place.  If they don't have enough, uh, uh, of a workforce to take care of the issue, they got to figure 
[00:25:00]  out another way to get help.  Something.  And then there's rumors with turning, uh, trucks away.  Is that true or false?  I, I hear it's not true.  I hear it's, it is true.  $10 a gallon.  Uh, no, $10 a gallon.  Are the, are the work crews being turned away from other States?  I have no idea.  I've heard it's a rumor.  I've heard it's absolutely true.  I don't fucking know at this point.  I have no idea.  Cause if they're spread way too thin, then they got to have a, they have to have a plan  B.  They have to, you can't have your customers without power for 10 days, 10 days. 
[00:25:30]  And, and again, it's 10 days with no light at the end of the tunnel here.  If it was 10 days and I saw these motherfuckers working on my, in my neighborhood, I'd be  like, well, you know, it must be a huge problem.  I know they're working.  It's 10 days with at least another, if they started working now, at least another two days.  So it's a guarantee.  You're not going to have power until next week. 
[00:26:00]  Next week.  Yeah.  Yes.  Cause every time I come in, I'm assuming you're going to go, I got power filing.  Nope.  It's that fucking.  They better not fuck up my Thanksgiving, man.  I'm going to Long Island for Thanksgiving.  Oh, they better not fuck that up.  Why don't they put the power lines into ground?  Probably.  I have no idea.  It would probably cost too much.  They really should start fucking.  They want to keep those profits way the fuck up.  So, you know, why, why would you do that?  Why would you do that for your customers?  When you put them underground, do you have to go through lawns or do you go, uh, I would 
[00:26:30]  imagine it's a motherfucker.  It's probably a bitch.  Yeah.  It depends on where the lines are.  Cause they do that for all new neighborhoods now.  Right.  If they're on the street, I'm sure it's a little easier than if it's like in my case, it's  between the yards.  It's between my backyard and my neighbor's backyard.  And there's telephone poles there with fucking wires strung from them.  I'm sure it's a motherfucker and I'm sure it would cost a shitload of money.  So what you do is it as a company like that, you want to keep the profits way the fuck  up.  Like Ann said earlier, you put band-aids on everything and hope you don't get caught. 
[00:27:00]  That's what they do.  And they got caught with the superstore.  Oh, they absolutely fucking lootly got caught.  And, and back to back here.  Now they got this fucking snow storm and, uh, more people are out of power.  And, and now, now even if they wanted to send crews to fix shit, they can't until the  snow is fucking gone.  And not only, I mean, the other thing they could do besides putting the lines on the  ground is like, you know, cut back a lot of these trees, which I, I drive around Long  Island enough.  Those trees are just waiting to fall. 
[00:27:30]  They're just waiting to gobble up.  I don't know what that's about.  I don't know if these towns or neighborhoods get pissed off cause they don't want, you  know, the, the, the branches, you know, cut all over the fucking place probably cause  it would look ugly.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't want to see the parkway, but it doesn't seem like that's, that's, that's right either.  Yeah.  I, I, I'm, we haven't heard from one lipo guy, by the way.  Usually we get these guys calling.  They're in hiding.  My phone would have like buzzed or something.  No, they're in, they're in hiding. 
[00:28:00]  Uh, none of this.  Tony on Long Island.  All right.  You know what?  We got to take a few of these.  Uh, guys without power.  Tony on Long Island.  Tony.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, yeah.  Andy, let me share in your pain.  I'm on the South Shore of Long Island.  I think I have it a little bit worse.  Nine days without power.  And then I get power late Tuesday night.  I'm doing back flips.  I put the generator in the garage.  You can't get the clothes up.  I'm real excited.  And guess what happened yesterday?  Yeah.  No power.  Yeah.  It's the 4th of July. 
[00:28:30]  A transformer on the block blows.  Tree sets on fire.  No power.  And guess where I am?  I'm at the bottom of the list because they already fixed me.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Sorry.  Oh, is that what happened?  Oh, God.  And even worse, those other pricks, cable vision, when I got the power back, they tell  me, your power's restored.  Your cable box should be resetting.  I called them yesterday.  I'm on hold for 30 minutes.  Then they tell me, oh, we're aware of your area.  We'll get to it when we get to it.  So no TV, no power, no heat, no nothing. 
[00:29:00]  And I'm not in an affluent community.  I'm paying over $13,000 a year in tax.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Insane.  A lot of people that are ready to come to this area to work.  I don't know the ins and outs of this.  I just know that this shit doesn't make sense.  What do you got, Danny?  You want to read some Craigslist ads that are people trying to get ass with gas?  Oh, I hear about this.  I respect that.  Is this true?  It absolutely is.  I made a paper yesterday, and I'm like, come on. 
[00:29:30]  Someone's just fucking around on Craigslist.  They're trying to trade sex for gas.  Got 15 gallons of gas and willing to trade for some female company.  How much I give up depends on what you're willing to give up.  If you're interested, send some pics.  Put gas in the subject line.  This is real.  Yes.  Some of them are probably just jerk-off fantasies, and some are probably real.  That's fucking great.  You need gas.  This is the title.  You need gas.  I need a BJ.  Wow.  That's great.  Seeking a BJ girl right now, cash or fuel, it's up to you. 
[00:30:00]  Must include two pics, serious only.  Be ready now.  Be ready.  Come on.  Have that mouth ready and loose and moist.  I'll go over and stick my dick in it.  At the same time, you shove your dick in her mouth, and then she shoves the gas can in  the fucking truck.  But the worst is that the woman has to have a fucking gassy hand holding her head.  She don't smell like fucking gas.  That's great.  All right.  We're going to learn about power lines underground.  That's what I like about this show.  We do learn. 
[00:30:30]  We learn fake shit from most of the people.  Possibly.  Matt in Harrison.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah.  I'm done with electrician.  I was taking a high-voltage splicing class.  They said it would cost a million dollars per mile to bury those cables underground throughout  all of New York.  It's a humongous undertaking between building manholes, running new cable, and making all the splices.  It's a bigger job than you think.  Yeah.  You need, like, access to them, so they're, like, inside conduit and shit. 
[00:31:00]  There's your answer.  It's very expensive.  There's your answer.  I would be certain.  Don't they have sewers?  You can't run them through water.  Run the electric lines in sewers.  Yeah.  No, no.  I mean, can't they just put a fucking...  Oh, yeah.  The sewers fill up.  There are septic systems in most of Long Island, too.  A lot of it doesn't have sewer systems.  And by the way, that story about them turning crews away, that's not true.  That wasn't true at all.  All right.  But then I got a guy in line one.  It's true.  It's not true.  They're trying...  It was a whole thing against the union. 
[00:31:30]  I'm a union electrician.  They just have tried to make it sad.  The union's never going to turn help away in times like this.  It's not true.  Okay.  Thank you, Matt.  What's this other guy saying now?  What's this other guy saying?  We have conflicting opinions here.  Actually, he did hang up in between us.  Oh, that...  He was there, though.  Another guy can explain on the ground power lines.  Fair enough.  Chris in Jersey.  Hey, I'm not going to say anything else that that guy said, but I can't believe I'm actually  talking to you guys.  Yeah, it is amazing, right?  It certainly is. 
[00:32:00]  We are big fucking stars.  Just breathe in the experience.  I can't believe I did it to myself.  Live in the moment.  Enjoy it, okay?  Bask in it.  It goes by fast, so really enjoy it.  Anthony, your tweet to the shit, man.  I love how you just rip people apart.  They're amazing.  What a privilege for you to read them.  What do you got, Chris?  Oh, no.  I was just going to say what a penny answer is to run them underground.  Basically, that guy said it.  He just wanted to go...  No worries.  You're backing them up, though.  Yeah.  But, uh... 
[00:32:30]  Why does everything cost so much?  When my dad was growing up,  they just were able to build and do shit  because it didn't cost so fucking much.  That's true.  Anthony, can I ask you something while I got you on the line?  Might as well.  What do you think would have actually happened  if Mitt Romney won the election?  Like, what do you think would have changed?  Oh, Christ.  No, I'm not an Obama supporter at all, man.  But it just doesn't matter anymore.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:33:00]  It's the great unknown, my friend.  Who knows?  In my personal opinion,  it was worth a try,  based on what had happened the previous four years,  to try something new.  But what would have happened?  I don't know.  Maybe it would have gotten better.  Maybe we would have found out  this guy was the biggest liar ever  and never fucking would have done anything.  I don't know.  But hasn't that history proved that to be the case  throughout our entire country  that he just gets elected in?  I just don't understand  how you can just support  somebody crazy like that. 
[00:33:30]  Because I wasn't supporting the guy  that I saw doing nothing for four years.  So why not go for the other guy?  He wasn't preaching stuff  that would have been detrimental.  So give him a try.  Just me off when people support either side,  actually, right now.  Oh, you're a middle-of-the-road kind of guy.  Hey, Chris,  that means me and you gotta hang out.  There you go.  That's my stance.  That would be the shit.  No, but it just pissed me off,  because, you know, 
[00:34:00]  you go on Fox News,  you're very influential,  and you're just like a dude.  And I just, I don't know.  It's just like...  I love being influential.  You seem like the ideologue  who would just hop on with Sean Hattity  and be like...  No.  Why if I share opinions with somebody,  am I considered like an ideologue  that would just pop on with Sean Hannity?  And we agree with things.  We agree politically,  so why is that bad?  I don't understand it. 
[00:34:30]  Well, by the way,  oh, sir,  to answer your point,  why do you think Anthony's influential?  I know he has a right,  but he's just expressing an opinion.  Like, why are you saying  that yourself or other people  are so easily led  that Anthony can sway your opinion?  He's a funny guy expressing his opinion.  That's all.  Well, people can't be swayed by...  That's their stupidity, then.  But they do.  They are swayed by people.  Very easily, matter of fact.  Hmm.  I think that you...  The way you are with socialists  is awesome.  That's exactly how I feel.  But that's something  that you probably never,  ever brought up there  because it just... 
[00:35:00]  It doesn't...  I don't know,  but it is what it is.  All right, Chris.  Why don't you just sit back  and enjoy the show?  Yeah.  That was a good phone call  from Chris and Jerry.  All right.  Especially not a bad question.  Chris likes the show,  but he disagrees with that  probably more than he's letting on.  All right.  That's fine.  Let's go to Ed in the Bronx.  I work for Con Ed.  Ed?  Oh, well, it's your company.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, listen.  I see a lot of crazy shit out here.  After three days,  people are walking out  like zombies asking for power.  And I feel bad for these people  because I was out of power myself. 
[00:35:30]  But I got power back on  and I look at these guys  and I'm like,  hey, I'm doing the best I can.  As far as the underground systems,  the underground systems  around the city  have been improved.  But they need more improvement  just like LIFA.  LIFA has put band-aids  that Sony Con Ed did  for so many years.  But they actually realized that,  hey, we need to wrap up our system.  So basically,  they've been putting in  like new equipment  all around the city  so people can, you know,  basically not lose power.  And it's expensive. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  It also takes years.  Yeah.  I'm all the way up  in Westchester also.  I'm like an assessor.  And I go all into these areas  and I see all these rich people  demanding power right away.  But I see these poor folks,  you know,  that have been around  in these areas  all their lives.  And I feel bad for them.  So basically,  what I do is  I try to get power to them first  before I can get  these rich people  their power.  But, you know,  it's one of those things.  You can't really  help everybody  all at once,  but everybody expects power. 
[00:36:30]  But, you know,  you're the only one person.  And as far as  getting crews  from other states  being turned down,  no, that's not it.  I've been seeing, like,  people from down in Georgia  and also seeing Quebec  has been sending  power crews down  from Canada as well  in this area  to help out.  Man.  All right.  I mean,  unless there's a fucking  nuclear bomb,  I don't think it should take  10 days  to even get an inkling.  Not 10 days  to turn the power on.  10 days  with no fucking  hope in sight still  to get my fucking power on. 
[00:37:00]  Amazing.  All right.  I'm clutching out anyway.  Thank you, Ed.  Now we go to Long Island.  Tom works for LIPA.  Tom, what's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Two things.  One thing is  the underground issue  a couple guys  touched on already,  the expense.  The other issue is  there's moisture on the ground.  It's going to make it  so when it comes time  to fix things  it's a pain in the ass  to fix it.  There are all  the underground power lines, though. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, but  in some neighborhoods,  yes.  But overall,  it's a nightmare  to fix stuff  when it goes wrong  on the ground.  And the other thing  with your backyard service,  what that is,  you have to,  you can't get  trucks back there.  Everything has to be  walked in.  The guys have to  bury the poles  by hand  and trucking it  on by hand.  Yeah.  So I ain't seen  no one walking either,  my friend.  Believe me,  I'll open the gate  and let them in myself.  No one has even  come creeping. 
[00:38:00]  You might not have  seen it,  but they're out there.  Are you guys  spread thin  or what, Tom?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But I'm not a guy  that works on the poles.  I go out and survey stuff  before we report back.  It's the same way  the guys have to go.  And it's just,  it's devastation out here.  And it's even out west  because I work out  in out east and low  out west,  it's even worse.  So, you know,  it's just a monumental test.  Companies have never seen  this damage before ever.  All right, you're right. 
[00:38:30]  So I'll just wait  another fucking week,  I guess.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I don't know what  to tell you about.  Exactly.  No one knows  what to tell me.  And that is absolutely  what annoys  the shit out of me.  I have no,  people go,  when are you getting  your power on?  I go, I have no idea.  It's 10 days later  and I still am saying,  I have no idea.  And they don't know  what to tell you.  They don't even know  what to tell me.  And people,  no matter who you are,  like I talked to Jerry Lipa  and he had no idea.  he didn't know.  All right, Tom.  Lipa,  I have no idea.  It's like,  Con Ed, 
[00:39:00]  we're on it.  Lipa,  I have no idea.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Lipa,  hang in there.  I have no idea.  Let's say hi to  Big Nick in Georgia.  I don't know.  Well, Lipa,  let's put your words  up here where  everyone can see them.  I don't know.  What is that?  Festivus.  Movie quotes  are a way  to get around  some of these things.  Yes.  Let's say hi  to Big Nick.  There he is.  Hey, boys.  Mr. Had. 
[00:39:30]  Mr. Had.  Hello, sir.  Hey.  I'm going to make it quick here.  I just heard about the news  that Mayor,  Governor Cuomo  just fired the head  of FEMA  down there in New York  for diverting crews  to his house  to clean out his driveway.  Yeah, yeah.  The head of FEMA  just got fucking,  or one of the guys  from FEMA.  I'm not sure exactly what it is.  One of the local guys  were local big shots?  Sent a crew  to his own house  to make sure shit was good  and boy,  he's gone.  Good.  I kind of like Cuomo.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mind Cuomo.  He's not as crazy 
[00:40:00]  as his dad was.  As crazy fucking.  Is he really a piece of shit?  We would all do  the same fucking thing.  Yeah, but he got caught.  You're caught doing it.  So you got to make him  a piece of shit.  All right.  He's a public piece of shit.  We're all private pieces of shit.  But I'm not surprised.  I mean, anyone would do that.  Yeah.  You call in favors,  you see who you know,  and you do some shit.  Oh, I believe he just got caught.  He got caught.  Gotcha.  All right, Big Nick,  thank you.  Much to know, guys.  Nick, hey.  Guys, did you say your name  for no reason? 
[00:40:30]  MTA doesn't talk  the three-hour commute F.  Who's on the phone, Z-Rock?  What does MTA  doesn't talk  the three-hour commute F mean?  Who wrote that, E-Rock?  Who wrote that?  We're looking at it right now.  We can actually see it.  What does it say?  Read it again.  You see that?  He doesn't talk  about the three-hour commute  yesterday.  I'm a cop,  and I lost power again  after getting it back.  Oh, so he wrote all that out?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  We can see it right here.  Oh, okay.  There's a problem with the...  Well, what we see is  MTA doesn't  tar the  three-hour commute F.  How does it happen?  Why would I take that phone call?  Why would we ever take that?  It's an...  It's fucking  auto-miscorrect.  Iowa checking in  because we do talk  to the whole country.  We're focusing  a lot locally,  but people out here  lost power for two weeks  because of an ice storm.  We get hurricanes down south, 
[00:41:30]  and they aren't that serious  as what you guys  are going through right now.  Alabama got hit  by Hurricane Ivan.  Sure, seven years ago,  we had no power  for 52 days.  All right.  Nice.  Oh, Ivan looks better.  Where the fuck do you live,  John, in a swamp?  No, I live in a  3,800-square-foot house.  I'm an ant income bracket,  but they've fucked me  just as good  as their fucking hell.  52 days? 
[00:42:00]  Well, Ivan had  140 miles an hour.  We didn't lose  just a few telephotoes.  Every one of them  motherfuckers were  snapped off.  Hey, Drew,  how'd you like  that I knocked you  out of the room?  Oh, is that him?  It's Drew from Bama.  Is it him?  Yeah.  From earlier?  You want back in,  you dickbag?  Were you the one  boo-hooing Anthony  because he's only gone  10 days?  No.  I thought you were  Drew from Bama.  Oh, it says John,  unless you change his name.  Well, that's why  the Alabama people  are boo-hooing you.  They know 
[00:42:30]  days without power.  Yeah.  52 days?  You would go crazy,  right, Ant?  Fucking A.  That's almost spring.  You gotta just start,  yeah.  The holidays, easy.  You gotta take it  into your own hands  and just fucking start  stringing fucking  wires yourself.  Are we gonna do  a Thanksgiving old school  with candle lights  and shit out there  in Long Island?  Candles.  I'm going to Bob Kelly's  for Thanksgiving.  God, we've been looking  forward to this Thanksgiving  for a while.  I know.  We're just gonna  glaze Bob naked. 
[00:43:00]  The butterball  serving the butterball.  You know what I like  to do when I walk  into someone's house  on Thanksgiving?  I like to go,  who is it?  I like to go,  I'm so not inviting you.  Is there a lot  of turkey foot  that gets played  on Thanksgiving?  Oh, sure there is.  I just make that  noise in their hallway.  Who is it?  What else, John, 
[00:43:30]  before we let you go?  I was out in my shed  this last weekend  and I started laughing  my ass off  because I got this huge  pile of 25-gallon gas jugs  lined up in the corner  of my shed  because I had to have them  for the generator  for 52 fucking days.  So go out  and buy us  some more gas.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  It would be nice  if we had gas stations  that had gasoline too.  That's the other part 
[00:44:00]  of this problem.  No one realizes  it's like,  oh, well,  I went this long  without power.  I went that long.  Oh, we've had no power.  We have no power  and no gasoline  which fuels  the fucking generators  so you can at least  survive out there.  That's the big thing.  Gasoline and no power.  What are our elected  officials doing  at this point?  Nothing!  Do something!  You guys keep believing  in that fun stuff.  I want the fucking  tanker trucks  to be brought in  like a fucking  military operation. 
[00:44:30]  Why aren't there  giant tanker trucks  driving toward  fucking New York  and Long Island  and Jersey?  Kenny,  do you have power yet?  Has Chuck...  No.  Still doesn't in Jersey?  They told you  probably by Wednesday, right?  Kenny's 10 days in  as well, obviously.  Yeah, because Kenny was...  Where's Chuck Schumer?  Is he hiding?  Does this have anything  to do with Chuck Schumer?  Where's Chuck Schumer?  Get Amy on the phone.  Give him a call.  Kenny, 10 days without power  and now you've got  six to eight inches  of snow near you, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, two power trucks  pulled on my street  yesterday.  Nice.  just as it started  in the snow  and they go,  see ya.  Wouldn't want to be ya.  Oh man,  they fucking left  when it started snowing.  Yeah, yeah.  So, hopefully  they'll come back today.  But, uh...  Good luck with that.  It's supposed to come out.  It's supposed to be okay today, right?  Well, the sun's going to come out  a little bit later.  No, we still got some wind  and shit to deal with.  We'll see.  Yeah, it's too windy.  Second half of the day  will be alright.  Everything's going to freeze up 
[00:45:30]  tonight, too, by the way.  I heard one more  tidbit of information.  Oh, yeah?  They ran out of telephone poles  so they're driving them up  from South Carolina.  I've got a couple  in my house if you need them.  I was going to get rid of them  but I'm like,  what do I do with these?  They're laying completely  across my living room  and it's just taking up  a lot of room.  We need Ted's Emporium  to get a couple  telephone poles.  Telephone poles.  What do you got?  You got some picks?  This is the front stoop  of my house.  There's a tree 
[00:46:00]  just laying on it.  It's relaxing.  There's a tree  just laying on it.  Is that from last night?  Yeah, that's from the snow.  There's a tree  lounging in front of my house.  I got a tree  on my stoop.  I got a tree  on my house.  I got a tree  reclining  in front of my house.  That clip is not fun  for many people now.  God, God.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  We were foreshadowing.  Oh, we were  absolute foreshadowing  there, huh?  And, uh, yeah.  Oh, and that's another thing.  Then the generator  had to take another burden 
[00:46:30]  of the pool cover pump.  White people problems.  Prepare for white people problems.  I have the pool cover on.  Right, with the bump.  And, uh, no,  not with the bump,  but with the pump.  But, yeah, with the pump.  Some of them have the thing.  Yeah, no, I have a pump  which sits on the pool cover  so when it rains and stuff  it gets pumped off.  Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.  And, um, uh,  now that is plugged  into the generator  but I shut the generator down  for certain times of the day.  And, um,  it just, uh, it's, 
[00:47:00]  that cover is going  lower and lower  and lower into the pool.  You're gonna have to  replace that probably.  Oh, it's just a clusterfuck.  I'm so glad  there's a lot of people  that understand Chuck Schumer.  They're all saying  he's hiding  because there's no power  for the TV camera  so why would he do anything?  Oh, that makes sense.  This motherfucker.  Yeah.  Does Amy like him?  I don't know if she cares about him.  I don't know.  I'm sure she likes him.  I know he probably  doesn't like, uh,  what she does.  Maybe I should shut my mouth.  No, fuck it.  He does like to be  in front of cameras.  That's all I'll say. 
[00:47:30]  He loves it.  He loves when the TV cameras are on.  He loves it.  Yeah, uh,  I don't understand  why people aren't,  these public officials  aren't on the news  demanding, uh,  fuel into this area  in, in, in a, uh,  a military operation-like way.  Fuel should be pouring in  to this area.  I don't know whose job it is.  I ain't a fucking politician.  Bloomberg's been kind of  not out and about as much. 
[00:48:00]  Bloomberg got...  It pops up a little bit  here and there, but...  Bloomberg got Manhattan  taken care of.  Fuck Staten Island.  Fuck Queens.  But that's all...  He doesn't give a shit.  But that's his shit.  I know, but he, as long as  Manhattan, as long as  the fucking, uh, stores  are open, uh, in Times Square  and that's all he cares about.  But this asshole  wants to be, uh, Giuliani.  He's fucking failing miserably.  Giuliani, a lot of people,  uh, people hated him,  but he stepped up  when, uh, this city  needed him.  Yeah.  And turned a lot  of people around. 
[00:48:30]  This Mayor Bloomberg  trying to get the marathon  running.  Yeah.  Because he, because he knows  that's probably something  Giuliani would have done.  He should be in front of  fucking TV cameras  every day.  Yelling and screaming.  How about, uh, now that  it's snowed, you have a  cross-country skiing  competition through  fucking, uh, Long Beach.  You fucking cock.  By the way.  Cack.  Cack.  Cack.  By the way, remember  we were talking about  maybe they just postponed  the marathon, even though  they said it was canceled?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  They start tearing  that shit down.  It's not.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  So where's the generators? 
[00:49:00]  Are they using them  to help people?  I saw it the other day.  It's over, Johnny.  And man, do they have  work crews out there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, they got to, uh,  tear that shit down.  Yeah.  Un-motherfucking-believement.  Uh.  It's still snowing  at where I am.  It's still snowing  at my fucking house.  It was still snowing  this morning.  It's still fucking snowing.  What the fuck?  Who's fucking  what I've been doing?  Nothing, Jimmy.  It's a new character.  Mouthful guy? 
[00:49:30]  Eggs man.  Ha ha ha ha.  I love when I give  a ridiculous name  for Jimmy's characters  and he, he has to have  another ridiculous name.  That was really his name,  though.  Oh, okay.  With a Z.  I got another Lipa guy.  I like when these guys  come forward.  You can use fake names.  I don't give a fuck.  Uh, Jim, what's up?  Yes.  Hey, what's going on?  Listen, I'm, I'm a lineman  for Lipa and we'll make him  I am a lineman  for the county  and I drive  the main road 
[00:50:00]  searching for  What?  Who does this?  We're not in our truck  right now.  We can't do anything.  We're just raking in the money  and we're not, you know,  I mean, they tell us,  the management tells us  what to do, we do it.  If not, I mean,  what are we going to do?  Exactly.  I understand.  I'm not bashing the guys  that are working for Lipa.  I'm a fan of the working Joe.  I'm not.  I'm suspicious of management  always.  It's management.  Always.  It's the people that fucking,  um, you know,  that put these jobs,  uh, that decide  where the crews are going.  That's the problem I have. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, you got these  out of town guys  coming in here.  They, they make half the money  out of state from here.  They're living in a hotel  right now.  They're doing the job,  but they're making,  they're making twice,  three times the, uh,  the amount of money  they make down at home.  They'll, they'll bring home  a, a, a, a, a yearly check  in, in like three months.  Why are they going to be  in a hurry?  We're not in a hurry.  Well, then somebody ought to  start cracking a fucking whip  on these motherfuckers.  You heard them.  We're not in a hurry.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:51:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  That is a dilemma.  Yeah, it is.  All right, Jim,  thanks for the honesty there.  Sure, man.  How about I see one  of these fucking guys  up on a goddamn pole  in my neighborhood,  you motherfuckers.  There's clubs for that.  Yeah.  It's a guy in a pole.  It's a guy in a pole.  There's no accountability, man.  There's no accountability.  No, no, there's,  there isn't.  It's, it's.  I just like saying that.  There's no accountability.  I'll take the responsibility,  you guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It's all Danny's fault.  He was a saucié.  Someone's got to step up. 
[00:51:30]  I hate when people step forward  and go, all right,  I take full responsibility.  Because you don't.  No, but he's nothing.  He's nothing, yeah.  That means if you say that,  something really bad  should have to happen to you.  Right.  You can't just say it  and take it.  It's like, oh,  this imaginary thing.  You should have to receive  a spanking  in the public square.  Right.  In front of everybody  for taking responsibility.  Oh, I hate that.  Ah, God.  All right.  We'll break.  Yeah, let's eat.  Oh, fuck.  And we'll do some other. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, do we have  our jingles today?  Opie and Anthony audio today?  Sure hope so.  That would be nice.  Something a little different.  We have guests, too.  Who do we got today?  We have two very big comedians.  Russell Peters,  who I am doing  a town hall with  after the show,  and the great Billy Connolly,  who we haven't had  in a while.  A couple years.  Easy.  I was reading his bio  before we went in,  and he has 32 comedy albums out.  No.  Dude, he's a fucking  massive comic.  We used to love him  on the show,  then he kind of disappeared 
[00:52:30]  for a few years.  I just don't know  if he's been around.  He might have been him.  I think he was down  doing The Hobbit.  He was in The Hobbit,  so he was probably  down in New Zealand.  Oh, no kidding.  He's in that.  And he was doing  Harry Potter before that.  Oh, man.  He's a real actor, too.  He's a real fucking guy.  Yeah, he's the shit.  Great Scottish comic.  Yeah, we like him.  He was doing our show  when we first got  to Satellite.  Yeah, he likes it.  On a basis.  True.  Very cool.  So that'll happen,  and I don't know. 
[00:53:00]  We might change gears  and try to do  something else next.  I don't know.  We'll see.  We'll figure it out, I guess.  Chip, chip, or sin  on the scene.  Chip, chip, or sin  on the scene.  Yeah.  What's that?  Excuse me, sir.  Can we interview you  for Chippa TV  for the YouTubes?  We're talking to people  in costumes and stuff.  What's your name?  My name's Victor.  Okay, that's a cool hat.  It probably keeps all the  rain out of your eyes.  And the sun.  And the sun and everything else.  The moon and whatnot.  I can't breathe  with this fucking mustache on.  I had a hat on before,  but people kept saying  you look like a fucking asshole, 
[00:53:30]  so I put the mustache on.  Now I can't fucking breathe.  How old are you?  I am 18.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Because I can't talk  to nobody under 18.  I got in trouble for that.  Oh.  What's the little horns  on your head?  Like you're very devilish  or something.  Oh, no.  You're supposed to be  cat ears, but I didn't.  Cat ears?  Oh, cat ears.  I thought you said cat ears.  I'm like, what,  are you playing golf  or something?  Chip, chip, or sin  on the scene.  Chip, chip, or sin  on the scene.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Fucking home run,  chip, or sin.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is  the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I am a lineman  for the county  And I drive  the main road  Searching in the sun  for another  home alone

[01:18:30]  And I told him  Why do that when you got  Access to a fucking radio station?  Exactly  Do that first  Of course  Oh my god  We can turn this channel  On whenever the fuck we want  No music  No other people's bits  What's he going to do?  Why don't we ask him  E-Rock what are you going to do?  What's the bageling  With the sex going to be?  I don't know yet  I'm figuring it out  What?  Do you have any idea?  Not yet  Oh god  He had a choice  Of executive producers  And these are people  That were you know  He could bounce ideas off of  And maybe figure some stuff out  The room  The choices were 
[01:19:00]  Is me  Danny  Travis  Troy  And Sal  Uh huh  Who do you think E-Rock  Picked for his executive producer?  No way  If you say Sal  I'll fucking go in there  And shave you with a hammer  Did you pick Sal?  I'd pick Sal  And why?  Don't say I don't know  You're a work cuckold  Why would you pick Sal?  He really is  Have him do something  And uh  So he likes you  But yeah  That's what it is 
[01:19:30]  It's like  E-Rock doesn't want anyone  That's going to overshadow him  But Sal's been doing  Nothing creative  Ah  Overshadow  Woo  Sal's been doing  Nothing creative  And he has been  Shitting on E-Rock  Yeah exactly  But it's just the worst  He still has hope  For that relationship  Is what it is  That's all it is  He has hope  But I have hope  For the show  Bagel with the sex  Alright  A week from Saturday  Bageling with the sex  Mark your calendars  6pm Eastern  On this channel  Nice  Alright what's the  What's the slug line  For the uh  The audio contest

[01:21:30]  Back alley  Oh yeah  It's Venice  Yeah  Oh Venice  Jim moved up in the hills  For this baby burrito  Right  And then when I did it  It was up at his house  I wonder if the light went on  When that kid was born  For Jim Jefferies  He's a baby?  Yeah two days ago  Oh my god  I didn't know that  You said it on the show  I didn't even catch it  Oh  I might have been busy  Two days ago  He became a father  And I wonder if that light went on  Or if he's like  Just the same dude  I don't know  I talked to Eddie Moore  Jim's a little harder  To pin down 
[01:22:00]  Yeah  Eddie's more on top of the  Where's our money?  Yeah you guys  What happened with that?  You guys are  There was something  I saw you tweeted about  Somebody's not paying you guys  There's a company called  Flex Sports Watch  Not Flex Watch  That's a company  That's just for charity  Oh wow  So Flex Sports Watch  Is a company that  Has negative ion technology  Negative  What is that?  It's fucking bullshit  Apparently it's snake oil  Ah 
[01:22:30]  But Jim and Eddie  Did reads for them  And so did  Ryan Sickler and Jay Larson  Who do the podcast  I like  Called The Crab Feast  So we did The Crab Feast  And talking shit  With Jim and Eddie  Jim and Eddie  Both did reads  For that company  And they're both owed  Like thousands  Really?

Over the years  We've sold  A bunch of snake oil  Oh fuck yeah  There was a company  That came forward  What that's the contact now?  Oh that's not good  When you put  Flex Sports Watch  Into Google  To get a website  Or whatever  The site that you end up  Going to is just 
[01:23:30]  A bunch of gibberish  And the actual domain  Is initial-website.com  That's not a good sign  You know what's  An even worse sign?  Is the guy  Who was acting  As my ad person  At the time  Whose name I won't say  His name is listed  On the domain name  Of that  Oh that's not  That's very good  That's a little conflict  And I called the guy  And I go  I need a name  Of a person  And I need a number  At Flex Sports Watch  Because I gotta pay these guys  Like that's one of the reasons  You join like a network  Is to be protected  Right sure  Yeah  And he goes  I can't  I'm hiring a claims lawyer

[01:28:30]  You see his gigs?  Yeah I looked over  The prep sheet last night  Staples Center  It's like  It's like the Rolling Stones  Fucking  Holy fuck  Gig list  Let's talk about Jay Moore  He's here  He's been here for days  He's been here for days  Russell Peters  Oh Jay Moore  The Rolling Stones  Are going to plug  Bargley Center  We had the lovely  Louis C.K. on yesterday  That was fun too  He came in  He had boating stories 
[01:29:00]  Told two boat stories  Because he thinks he's  Captain Louis C.K. now  And he's just a hazard  To the waterways  A fucking hazard  Yeah  He thought he found  A submarine  He thought he found  A submarine  Reported it to the  Coast Guard  Off of like  Lower Manhattan  Near the Statue of Liberty  Statue of Liberty  And just sat there  For an hour  Calling the Coast Guard  Convinced the thing  Was following him  It turned out to be  One of those giant  Fucking metal buoys  That you just  Link up to  If you're a ship  A mooring ball  And then he  That's what Russell has 
[01:29:30]  He gets stuck  Thank you  Good night  There it is  There it is  I'm gonna go hang out  With E-Rock  That's all you gotta do  Who's also a mooring ball  Obviously E-Rock  From the neck up  Yeah  Yeah  And then he talked  About getting his boat  Beached or something  Like that  You're probably  Doing very well  For yourself these days  Probably  Did you  Did you  Did you  Splurge for a few things  Maybe like a boat  Or a cool car  No  I had just recently  Considered buying a plane  Really  Are you kidding 
[01:30:00]  To fly or to have  Someone fly for you  To have  And then I talked  To like a bunch  Of plane owners  And I wanted to do  My research  Yeah  I'm glad I did  Really  What's the deal  The plane was  Fucking nice  Was it a Gulfstream  It was a G3  Yeah G3  Oh fuck  But then the guy  Was like  Well you know  They're coming out  With a G something  Next year  And the G3  Is going to be obsolete  And that's why  They're so cheap  Right now  Oh is that it  Because it was like  A mil and a half  I'm like a mil and a half  And this is a 13 seater  And I threw on it  It was beautiful  It was awesome  But  It's like the iPhone 
[01:30:30]  But then the guy said  Wait for the new one  With more apps  You want that old plane  It doesn't even get  Off the ground no more  Can I text on it  Yeah  But what's the big problem  With plane ownership  Jesus  Well they said  Maintenance right  Yeah maintenance  And they spend more time  On the ground  Than they do in the air  And that's true  You know one  One little  Yeah  That's the least  Oh no  Yeah  Poor pain  It's also  So you're going to hire  A pilot  And you're going to fly them  Yeah you're going to pay them  80 grand a year  Yeah that's it 
[01:31:00]  That's quite the expense  Pretty cheap for a fucking guy  That's got your life in his hands  I know you'd think  He'd want a raise  Yeah  Yeah  And he'd ask you  Fucking 30,000 feet  Yeah  I should make it 100  Hey we're low on gas  Do you think you can give me a raise  Yeah  You got it  So you just didn't trust  The whole thing huh  Well yeah  The guy said  The boat owners  And plane owners  Are two favorite  Their happiest days  Are the day they bought it  And the day they sold it  Oh fuck  Ah there you go  So my grandfather used to say  A boat is a giant hole in the water  You pour your money into  Yep 
[01:31:30]  That's what it is  Expensive  My grandfather would say  A boat is a great place  We can be alone  You know  It's a molesting joke  We understood it Chip  I know  A wife is a giant hole in your house  That you throw money into  Two happiest days  Is the day you marry her  And the day she gets cancer  James T. Kennedy 
[01:32:00]  And the day she gets fucking run over  Or beheaded by Al Qaeda  Ah shit  So you were gonna buy a plane  You decided against it  Decided against it  What have you done  Any cool cars  How much is the new one  If you get the new one  How much is that  The new one's like  20 mil or something  20 million dollars  I'm not doing that  That's insane  But what's on the new one  I don't know  Well the old one  Is like from 1970 something  That's why  But you can't tell  When you look at it  And they're like  You know it's only got 
[01:32:30]  A couple years left on it  The guy was telling me  Oh shit  And then what  The wings fall off  What the fuck  He was like  You know then  It just starts to go  And repair  After repair  After repair  They know  They could figure out  Like how long  A plane has  Because of things  Like metal fatigue  Well call American Airlines  Ask them how long  Their fucking old ass  Plans have been lined up  Those 767s are scary man  They're fucking  They're getting like  Little hairline fractures  There's always  The 767s are always a problem  With the electrical working  And then the frightening  And those are the newer ones  Of the  Like compared to  Even the 730s and 50s  I think you can just tell 
[01:33:00]  When you get on board  And the fucking  TV screen pulls out  Of the center console  Of the aisle  Yeah yeah  You can tell  And they're changing cassettes  So you can watch fucking TV  They actually had  Ashtrays  In the armor  The instructions are in Latin  That was much funnier  Than the reaction  It got  Yeah it was  Yeah I'll give it to you  So what have you splurts on?  Anything cool?  Come on  I traded in my Rolls Royce  Oh yes  And you bought  Rolls Royce the singer  Yeah I did 
[01:33:30]  I did  And now I opened up  A car wash  Yeah  There was a high five  Going on  Nice  Russell Peters  I traded in the  Rolls Royce convertible  And got the  Bentley Mulsanne  Ah fuck  What's the difference?  Yes yes  Well one's a Bentley  One's a Rolls  That's what I thought  One's a convertible  One's not  What's a better car?  Depends on what you like  I mean for looks wise  The Rolls Royce  It would  No matter where I went  No matter what car  Was beside me  They would stare at the  Rolls Royce 
[01:34:00]  Right  I could have like  Five Lamborghinis beside me  And they'd ignore those  And look at the Rolls Royce  You have to get a driver  When you get a car like that  No no but that's the  Two door convertible one  So it's for you to drive  But it was starting to  I don't know  They announced they're going  To release three new ones  And I'm like  Oh so I got the old one  You can't have the old one  I love the way he thinks  It's like  I can't have the old one  I can't have the old one  Like a fucking asshole out here  I'm new money  I need to make sure  This shit looks right  It's just a weird conversation  To be having with another stand up  He's not a fucking  It's not like he plays 
[01:34:30]  Bass for the Stones  It's like he's a fucking comedian  He's talking Gulf Streams  And talking real money  I thought of getting a plane  I'm like I upgraded with Miles  I went business  I went with Miles  Question on the table  Would you rather have  Louie's two Emmys  I sure would  Or Russell's money  Well Louie's got money too  But would you want to have  Russell money  Is what we're saying  Yeah Russell has a lot more money  Russell Peter's money  I would rather Louie's talent  Russell's money  And Russell's funny

She will be two next month  Good for you  I like her  I'm so glad  You just picked up your phone  And looked at her  Instinctively  And all I could think of was Jimmy's meaty pictures  Like here she is  I'm glad I haven't had to have any contact with my ex-wife in like ten years  None  None of us want it either  Oh please  We know what you went through  What a bitch  Did you have babies with her?  Nope  No babies  No property  No anything  The only relationship we had  Was me getting her lawyer's dick in my ass 
[02:00:00]  And having to pump money out of my fucking wallet  To her  A shitload of money  And they didn't own any property  No kids  Nothing  Here's the saving grace though  I found out  She ran through a lot of the fucking money  Of course  And last somebody saw  She was hopping on some bikers  The back of some bikers bike  In Huntington or some shit  And riding off into the sunset  Where's Huntington?  Huntington, Long Island  Well that's where Governor's is  I'm going to be there  Friday, Saturday, Sunday  That's Levittown, Long Island  Right  That's close to Huntington  And her lawyer was Dominic Barbera 
[02:00:30]  Who we know is now destitute  Homeless  Disbarred pretty much  Not disbarred  But suspended from practice  He's not homeless  And well he was living in the  That's what the newspaper said  He was living at the  Hotel or something  Hotel in Garden City  Fuck that guy  And his house has been foreclosed on out east  And he's broke  He's found Jesus  Even though he's Jewish  He's a piece of shit  That's Jesus, his neighbor  Yes, yes  He found Jesus  One of the biggest pieces of shit  Yeah, I mean  But you know what  You can't put a price on that 
[02:01:00]  You know what  The best revenge is living well  It's true  It is true  As Anthony only is  He squeezes droplets of gas  Into his generator  And huddles around his boat  Living well  Just living well  Let me tell you that, Jake  Take some video of the story  And put it on YouTube  There's a little  There's a little break in the action  As far as this great life is  Something about it  That's kind of  Yeah, sometimes living well  Takes a little breather  That's funny  There's a little bump in the road right now  It is kind of cool  You know, make sure  Things, you're taking care of  Your fucking  Your cave 
[02:01:30]  Your domicile  I got my guns  I'm fucking ready to shoot looters  But no one told you at the time  When I was going through a divorce  My wife now said  You know, legally  No one can stop you  From being divorced  There's no reason  You can't be divorced tomorrow  Legally  No one can stop it from happening  If you demand it  Really?  It's the lawyer's job  To keep it going and going  So I called my lawyer  Because it had gone on  For like eight months  Which was three years  I was going to say  Which is like a quarter  Of the time of yours  And then I called my lawyer  And I said 
[02:02:00]  I'm not paying you another dime  Until I'm divorced  I was divorced in 48 hours  Wow  That would be great  It went eight months  But if you just said  I'm out  What state?  California  Wow  They don't have one of those  Reasons in California  To do that  When I got divorced  It's no false state  They had  They had to have a reason  You had to have  Irreconcilable  Different  Not even irreconcilable  There was like  Cruel and inhuman punishment  You should have  Just signed up for that  A holding back sex  Like all kinds of shit  I think I went with  Cruel and inhuman  Or  Just pick one  I know  Who cares at that point  Or you could be 
[02:02:30]  Separated for a year  And then you can get a divorce  But  It has to  Go both ways in New York  Or it did  At the time  They changed it  Because you can get  An annulment now  Without the other person's  Signature  In the Catholic Church  If I could have done that  You can go  Because I got an annulment  And I went  I'm like  Well she's never  Going to sign this  And they go  Well sometimes  You know  If it's a hostile  Thing  Like if someone's abused  Or something  They have to go about  The Catholic Church  To figure out a way  Where they can do it  You should have sent  Luca Brazzi over there 
[02:03:00]  He sleeps to fish  Luca Brazzi  Barkley Center  Brooklyn  You're going Saturday night  I want it  Fucking Primo  If I get out of the LA trip  Primo I'm there  Hey Jay  How long were you married  I want to hang out with you  Now Rogers is going to be there  Oh yeah  Who is  No from  Oh the Sheik  Yeah  Sorry  Jay  How long were you married  Now Rogers  Six years  Fucking six years  1.6 million dollars  I drove home in a leased car  And $600  And people  Well at least you got to keep the house  I go  The house doesn't  It's not a job  The house is a burden 
[02:03:30]  I wish you took the fucking house  That shit went on the market  You lost 1.6  Yeah  That was everything I had  I'm in a unique position where  Anytime people go like  How is that fucking fair  It's not  It's absurd  It's unbelievable  And you know it's even worse  You walk away with nothing  This is Anthony  The GOP over here  Will go with me  This is somebody  I guess if I  You know  In Casablanca  Like you hate me  Like well I guess  If I ever thought about you  Like I don't even think about this person  No  But the thought that she had to pay half  On the shit that I 
[02:04:00]  That's what I collected  After I paid half  Uh huh  And then I give her my  Everything I had  It was an arbitration  And then she has to pay half taxes on that  So the government actually got like 80%  They made out  Like they fucking get it  Yeah yeah yeah  Like this is somebody I hate  And I'm like  Don't fucking tax her 50%  You savages  I already paid the taxes  Wow  I should have just went to  Legalzoom.com  Yeah  This fucking ghetto divorce  I wound up winning the tax deduction  From the money  Which was contested 
[02:04:30]  During the settlement  It was just like  Fighting back and forth  So I got to deduct  What I paid her  Uh which Dominic  Didn't want to have me do  And I got to keep the um  Well well  What they wanted was  That if I died  Um or if she died  I still had to pay  Like even if she was dead  To her  I had to pay her estate  For nine years  She doesn't have an  She has nobody  Fucking uncles  Wait Jay  What year was this  That you were broke  Uh before Ghost Whisperer 
[02:05:00]  So I guess like 2000  Through 2004  You were broke  I know  That's what's great about stand up  Is you just make a couple calls  And you're at the Tempe Improv  You're at Stand Up Live  There you go  You come to Gotham  And the Mazzillis go  Yeah yeah  You know you just book dates  You make some money  Jeez man  And you go to the green room  And there's food  And it's the great  And acting too  Like you show up  And they ask  What do you want for breakfast  Then you break for lunch  You snack all afternoon  You drive home  There you go  Any actor that ever complains  Is a fucking dick  It's the only job 
[02:05:30]  Other than whore  Where you just show up  And lay down  Wow  Like hey we're not going to  Use you for two hours  So if you want to go relax  Lay down  Take a nap  That'll be cool  Well when you're doing  We got this multi-million dollar thing  Grinding the gears  Well when you did the CSI thing  I hung out with you  In a trailer  All day  That's right  Just hanging out  And they needed him on set  That day for  It couldn't have been  More than ten minutes  And I literally could have said  And we hung out in his trailer  For hours  And you were there  I could have said  Hey to an intern  I need three pizzas  Right  And they would have just  Delivered them  And they'd just go get them  That was amazing to me  You can ask for anything ridiculous 
[02:06:00]  Yeah  Do you act  Me?  Yeah  No I'm not  Fuckin'  I'm not gonna ask you for real  No I do  I just don't get a lot of work  Oh okay  I haven't had an acting gig  Since March of 2011  What was that?

It's not on the calculator app  Were you good in the movie?  I never saw it  Wow 
[02:06:30]  You really are an actor  Yeah  When they were like  Calling me  They were like  Hey can you help Twitter  About the movie  It's coming out  I'm like  Oh really cool  Where can I see the trailer?  And I saw the trailer  I didn't see me in the trailer  And then I didn't see me anywhere  And I'm like  Well how do you want me  To promote this film  When nobody's gonna believe  I'm in it  You didn't even put me  In the fucking trailer  I'm not Twitter shit about it  Wow  And I mean this in all sincerity  You know I'm being sincere  You are an enormous international star  It would have behooved the studio  To say 
[02:07:00]  And Russell Peters  Just that mention  Gets everybody  Oh yeah  Look out  Here's my guy  Because you obviously have  A die hard international following  You've done stand up  In where  Saudi Arabia  Introducing him  Middle East  But not Saudi Arabia  Ladies and gentlemen  You've seen him  Very catchy to go  When you had no credits  He's one of the hottest comics  In the country  And you're about to see why  Russell Peters  Man  He's a good man  Where's the love

[02:08:00]  What you gave up on walking  But you're not going to give up  On the Barry cats  As far as being the best  But he wouldn't do walking  It was really weird  That was weird  That was a great long Pacino story  We had Kevin Pollack in  And he just would not do  Fucking walking  And we wanted to have  The big showdown  I think he feels like  Yeah  He doesn't want to compete  That's like  It was a little strange  Thomas you're a weird breed  That's why  I don't want to compete  I wanted to see  His tank  Like I love it  Right  And I already said  Like his was the best  I just wanted to  I thought it'd be super fun  To go back and forth 
[02:08:30]  We liked when Kevin's on the show  That was just a little strange  Just have fucking fun with him  His Nicholson was amazing  One of those days  Yeah yeah  Maybe it was  You ever have  Shelly  You ever have  One of those days  Can I ask  I want to ask Russell  More questions about the Middle East  Doing stand up in the Middle East  Yeah  Which areas  What did I do  I did Oman  Oh man  Jordan  Lebanon  Jumps down my throat  Because I say Saudi Arabia  Like I'm a jerk  Bahrain  No I did 
[02:09:00]  Because Saudi  Every country around  Like alright  No but Saudi Arabia  I didn't play Jersey  It was Long Island  Staten Island  Connecticut  We'll ask him  Why not Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia's too strict  I didn't want to go there  Oh they're crazy over there  They're a little nutty with it  You can't go over there  With an app with vagina pictures  No  Behind your calculator  They'll find it right  But you go to Bahrain  Which is just across the bridge  Bahrain  And it's party time  Doesn't Saudi Arabia have those  Fucking guys that walk the streets  With the fucking staffs  And they look for  Religious crimes  They got the  I don't know  I've never been  Yeah they're crazy  Fucking  You'd be crazy to go there 
[02:09:30]  I saw  I saw one of those  What the fuck is that show  Where  Oh Locked Up Abroad  And there was some gay dude  And he worked at a hospital  And he got laid off  And then he got this offer  To go to Saudi Arabia  To work in one of their hospitals  For a while  And make a fuckload of money  And then people would tell him  Look  Being gay there  Is fucking illegal  You can't fucking be gay there  So he's like  Ah it's alright  I won't do anything  While I'm there  How do you resist  Now he's locked up  As abroad  Oh he went  He went  He was doing okay 
[02:10:00]  Well  Some fucking  Little twink  Was working at the hospital too  And then  They started  Go on  And he  They hooked up  First getting hot  They hooked up now  Yeah please  But they didn't even hook up  Like sexually  He told him though  Where to go  Like there's some kind of  Underground club atmosphere  Where they have booze  Which is completely illegal  Gay sex  All kinds of shit going on  So he went there  And then he went online  Imagine the stress 
[02:10:30]  Of running that place  They fucking look online  Yeah  Can you imagine  Oh crazy  Why would you do that  The codes alone  You're just being  Beafed and killed  Why the fuck  Would you own that place  Yeah  They fucking  They  Anyway  He went online  Yeah yeah  He went online  He went online  And they monitor all that shit  And he was supposed  To have some kind of  Anonymizer  On his browser  Which he did  But he hooked up  With a guy  They fucking  Start fucking  And everything like that  And whatever those 
[02:11:00]  Gays do  And  And I think the guy  The guy ratted him out  The gay guy ratted him out  Because he was being like  Fucking  When Anthony  Started fucking  He moved his arms  Like while they were fucking  Somebody was playing  Yakety Sax  And they started fucking  You know  It's crazy  Oh fast motion  Fast motion  Blowjob 
[02:11:30]  But then the other guy  Smacking him on the head  Like Benny Hill  Did the other guy  Get in trouble too though  No I think he anonymously  Turned him in  Here's the picture  Yeah yeah  He anonymously turned him in  He's like  I'm not gay  I'm having  I'm giving him sex  Right  The other guy's taking it  And it's punishable by death  So wait a minute  The anonymizer didn't work  No  No apparently it did  But the other guy  That he picked up  Ratted him out  So yeah  But you got it  When you're doing  You gotta both be anonymous  Yeah you gotta both be anonymous 
[02:12:00]  And you can't fuck over the guy  By all of a sudden  Trying to find some other  Cock  Around Saudi Arabia  The guy got a little jealous  Called the fucking  Religious police on this guy  And he was walking down the street  Russell said it was a bridge  Yeah it was a bridge  There was a bridge  He literally said  There's a bridge from Saudi Arabia  To where  To Bahrain  From Kentucky to Indiana  But I want to go back  Apparently it was a bridge too far  I want to go back to that  What do they laugh at  In the Middle East  Everything  They laugh at the same stuff  We're laughing at here  Pretty much the same shit  Yeah  You ever get a cab in Manhattan  You guys know what I mean right  You drive them all  What do you mean the same shit 
[02:12:30]  Like what  Like literally  Like everything  Like from jerking off  To fucking  Ooh I would think  To getting divorced  Whatever  You don't really see a big difference  No there's no difference  When I was in Dubai  This last time  They had the CID  Was at my show  That's their like  Their  What do they call  Like the decency police  Or something  And I've been to Dubai  So many times  And done my act  So many times  And it's a different act  These times  But it was  You know there's always  Some sort of fucking  Jerking off  Or shitting  Or something  Whatever  But this time 
[02:13:00]  They sent  They  They said  These guys were there  And I did this joke about  You know there's a kid  In the audience  I did  You know you're jerking off  Blah blah blah  You know that horse shit  The crowd enjoyed it  Yeah  And then I did a joke  About a girl  Having a tattoo of scriptures  On her back  And then you know  That's the last thing  I want to find out  I flip the chick over  And I'm fucking her  And there's the bible  Staring me in the face  Right  And then  So this CID guy  Calls my brother  Who's my manager  The next day  Like you need to come  In the office  Oh man 
[02:13:30]  And I was like  Yeah he can't be doing that  He can't  He can't say the F word  And he can't make  Sexy movements  And sexy gestures  Oh god  Oh what's the matter  You were getting a rod  Yeah  But it turns out  The guy who reported us  Didn't understand  What I was saying anyway  He just was like  So this  He was doing something bad  Just explain it  They're reasonable people  Yeah  So then we were  They were like  You can't say that  Tomorrow night on your show  So you're going to  Have to change your show  Or we'll shut the mic off  On you  And I go  Alright well tell them  I'm going to cancel the show  Ah nice 
[02:14:00]  So we go to cancel the show  And then the royal family calls  And they're like  Hey  One of the royal family  Was at the show last night  And they really liked it  They want to send his brother  Wow  One of the princes  Wants to come down to the show  With ten of his friends  And I go  So we call the CID guy  We go  Listen we're going to cancel the show  He goes  Okay  And I go  But you have to call the royal family  And tell them  That we're canceling it  Because they want ten tickets to the show  Oh no no no  Everybody can go  Everybody do it  Do whatever you need to do  It's not real  It's not like it's a real problem 
[02:14:30]  It's kind of like  If you give this person the power over you  They'll take the fucking power  They're going to use it  But they have no power  It's kind of like  Well  The people really in charge  Aren't these degenerates  That the people  That are the face of the people  I have no idea  What you're talking about  It's an amazing world  To be at your level  Oh yeah  You know what  Then you got 30,000 people  Waiting for me to go  And you're dealing with like  Fucking royal families  And well  Yeah  With that said  I got another question  What's the most trouble you've been in 
[02:15:00]  Doing stand up for the world  Because it's different everywhere  Have you gotten yourself in a tough spot or  No  Not really  Not really no  It was just that  That was about the closest I got to any trouble  Never been arrested or any of that shit  No  Yeah  Not since I was a kid  Yeah  Fingers crossed Hope  No  It's fascinating  Yeah  Because the language barrier  Or the content would scare me  People are like  Why don't you go to like Dubai  There's like  You know  Expatriates I think  And I'm like no  Because my act is  It's vulgar 
[02:15:30]  And even when it's not vulgar  Some of the content  I just don't want to deal with that  Because I'm not Russell  Like I don't have that fan base over there  The royal family  Yeah but here's the thing  If you were to go for expats  The locals wouldn't know you were there anyway  Oh okay  When I used to perform in Dubai  Before anybody knew who I was  I nobody  I would just be performing  In front of expats  You could do whatever you want  That's why  This time it pissed me off  Because I'm like  I'd been here so many times  And now because it's a to-do  People are like  Oh no no  We need to watch  What's going on here  Right  And they tried to use Akon 
[02:16:00]  As a benchmark for me  They were like  We've shut up the mic on Akon before  I go  Really don't fucking compare me to Akon  Jackass  What was his language?  No his sexy show I guess  I don't know much about Akon  Well me neither  That's why I was like  Even more pissed  I'm like  Don't compare me to that  What was his song  Is one really good song  About apologies to  I'm sorry  Or the apology  I don't know  I think his whole career  Was an apology  What was his song  I like that  Was that an apology  Something about apology 
[02:16:30]  That's an apology  Andy you know that song  It's the  And that has another word after it  Another one  Russell we've been told  You've got to leave at nine  Is that true?  Damn  I don't know do I?

Wow  And I'm at the end  It's really difficult  Because they don't allow me  To talk about the story  Right right  But a guy gets killed  And I take his place  And it happens at the end  Oh okay  That's detailed enough  So no one's gonna do jazz  I'm gonna cut you out of the movie now  I was gonna say  The king is the king is the king  No one's gonna see Billy Connolly  For about eight years 
[02:20:00]  I know  Eight fucking years  Eight years from now  You can talk about it  Eight years  The last part of the movie comes out  Jesus  Wow  Wait what's his name in that  Martin  He played Tim in The Office  Martin Freeman  Martin Freeman's in that right  Yeah he was Tim  From The British Office  Sorry  Sorry  Yeah Martin Freeman  I know who he is  Yeah yeah  Yeah it's really difficult  But I'm a dwarf  But  But I'm a regular side  Right  So they make you wide  They give you a fat suit  And make you wide 
[02:20:30]  They give you big hands  And all that  That way  You can be put in scenes  Where you look smaller  And then they adjust the scenery  And you look wide  And short  That's pretty cool  Iron boots  I wear this suit  That's a little weird  Than a fucking Volkswagen  You know  And I'm supposed to fight  Using an axe  And I can hardly move  It's very difficult  Wow damn  That's crazy  But it's a good laugh  Was that where they complained  Because they were using  Full size actors  As dwarves  There was one movie  Where they were using  Regular size actors  And then  Under the rainbow  Billy Barty 
[02:21:00]  Was it this movie  Billy Crystal  Well on The Hobbit  They've got people  Of all sizes  They've got giants  And wee tiny people  Yeah  So at lunchtime  You can sit  Depending on what height  You want to feel  Oh really  So  You know  If you can go over  And sit with the little guys  Feel like a giant  You want to bully someone  Yeah  Go over with a giant  Smack them around a little  Yeah  It's pretty creepy  So they did that  Down in New Zealand

[02:23:00]  Waiting for Godot  That's funny  He's short  Live  And then when  Then the last time he came to my gig in LA  He said  Have you still got the same numbers  I've got a thing in mind for you  And I thought  Oh it's Godot  And then he came up with this  I've never had that happen  No  Somebody said  If you had the same number  I have a thing in mind for you  A thing in mind  Jota Rosa  That's a fucking shotgun with a toe trigger  I'll be very lucky  I've never auditioned for anything  Wow

[02:24:30]  Oh right  And I love it  Yes  It was somebody  Tell them you hate them  And they keep calling  Right  I was yelling at somebody  In the audience  I apologize  Korean  Yes  It was wonderful  He was shouting and bawling  I was very angry  You should have been here yesterday  When they announced the election results  Oh right  Oh my goodness  Differently  Oh terrible  And then they'll listen tomorrow  That's the beauty of this  They come back  They're like battered wives 
[02:25:00]  Yeah  They always say  I fell down the stairs  I hit my head on the door  When I opened it  Oh he'll change  He loves me  He said he does  And then you know  You get back and  Bam  He cracks you in the face  And they also know  They provoked the beating  That's the thing  Right  They deserved it  A good wife knows  That she should have been quiet  I started it  He's a good man  I shouldn't have pushed his buttons  Yeah  I shouldn't have pushed his buttons  Exactly  That's what they do  They push my fucking buttons  You gotta tell them  But now that Obama was re-elected  We're all good here 
[02:25:30]  So right at  I went through my  I went through my yesterday thing  Where I wasn't very pleased  With the election results  But  And he went a little crazy  A little bit  I went a little crazy  You didn't warn Romney did you  Yes I did  Holy shit  Sorry  I happen to be  One fucking sane person  In this country  That thinks  Perhaps we need somebody  A little more familiar  With economics  During these  Trying economic times  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about  The shitty economy 
[02:26:00]  And the fact that  A businessman  Oh and they handed him  A wonderful economy  Didn't they  When he came  Oh boy  What's he gonna use  As an excuse  The next four years  George W. Bush still?  Please  We were in wars  That  By the way  After 9-11  Everyone wanted to fight  By the way  Everyone  I love everyone  Going  Man  Three unnecessary wars  Fucking September 12th  We were chomping at the bit  To fucking kill anybody  Language  And then  A few years later  Everybody's like  Where were we?  What fucking happened? 
[02:26:30]  Billy Connolly's looking like  Looking at you like  You're a crazy person  Well  Many people do  Beacon Theater  December 6th  You can hear the opposite  Version of that argument  Exactly  That's Billy Connolly  Billy Connolly  You really need a fucking Mormon  Well you know what  Much like  He doesn't have magic underwear  Well much like  I don't like  Discriminating against people  For their race  I don't think  Their religion  Should come into play either  It absolutely should  It's the first thing  You should talk about  Is a religion  Because it's a choice  Well I would assume  That a black president 
[02:27:00]  Would cater more to  His black constituency  Than the white constituency  Much like  We still have white  What?  Who's raised by the white side  People don't see that though  He's only as black  As Derek Jeter  Ah  But can he hit?  Yeah apparently yes  He's got two beautiful  Young ladies  Oh  I wasn't talking that  I want to go see  Billy Connolly  December 6th  The Beacon Theatre  Of course  A room that  Russell Peters calls quaint  This son of a bitch  Is playing the Barclays Center  Where the basketball plays 
[02:27:30]  Where the basketball plays  I was like  You know  Let's speak about this  Once Billy  You see  When I first came here  He wasn't up to much  You know  I used to patronize him  I used to speak down to him  And now he's a famous superstar  I don't know what to do  Oh not me  Yes  No him  He's doing the Barclays  At a Russell  Are you?  Oh fuck you  He thought he meant  You worked in the door  Or something  You know what  You can still patronize me  You know what  It's amazing  Billy  Billy 
[02:28:00]  Has not an inkling  Of a clue  Who you are  But it's funny  When I met him  At the premiere  Yeah  He goes  I hear we're doing  The same venues  And I was like  Oh so Billy Connolly  Knows who I am  I was all excited  Yeah somebody told me  I've never heard of you  They told me  Holy shit  They told me  You're doing all these  Giant gigs  Yeah arenas  It always takes me  By surprise  Arenas  Thanks  Because I don't  No really  I don't have much  Of a clue  Of what's going on 
[02:28:30]  I don't stay in touch  With every comedian  What they're doing  No no I understand that  You can't fucking be  You know  Especially when I go back  To Britain  You know I don't know  Anybody  No  Just charging along  Doing super stadiums  And things  Yeah  Guys I never heard of  It's good  It's quite exciting  Yeah it must be  I used to watch Billy  When I was in England  All the time  Did you  Yeah  I started going to England  In 95  I would see the DVDs  And videos in the stores  No I'm not a thief  Holy shit  Wow what's going on here 
[02:29:00]  I'm not a thief  Yeah  I'm a thief so don't worry  We're  We used to watch his videos  Well Eddie Izzard openly admits it  Yeah well  He also openly does a lot of things  Eddie Izzard  Wait  Eddie Izzard takes your stuff  Hmm  He said he based his style on mine  Really  And he used to go to the park  And practice as me  In a park  He would go to the park  You know the way I change the subject a lot  Have you ever seen me live  I have but it's never  It's been a long time  I change the subject a lot of the time 
[02:29:30]  I just  Because I forget what I'm talking about  I just talk about something else for a while  Until I remember what I was talking about  It's a good motto to have  Keep talking until you remember  What you were talking about  And he would go and practice doing that  Really  I don't know how you could practice it  But he  That's what he did  He told me the other day  He was rehearsing ADD  That's absolutely bang on  So your real kind of necessary randomness  He made 
[02:30:00]  He created  Calculated  Yeah calculated  I think he put on the dress to smoke screen  That he was stealing from you  That's a good  I mean  I was always dying to see him in a dress  I didn't get to see it until I got it on my computer  And I saw him in his high heels  So hot  He was  I thought he was amazingly attractive  In lieu of a kilt  He went with a dress  It's very odd that he would do that  You watch it  You're in soggy ground now  Wait a minute  It's the oddest thing to do that  Like it's so weird  And it doesn't make sense 
[02:30:30]  For him to go up in a dress like that  And do his act  You're trying to explain it to me the other day  But it made no sense  It made perfect sense to him  To him yeah  Well whatever  Because he was explaining his new nail varnish  And he's got like a union flag on one of the fingers  And a United Nations one on the other finger  The nails you know  And the rest are all red  And it was a European transvestite 
[02:31:00]  And it's a working transvestite  Whatever that means  Working class transvestite  It didn't make any sense again  He's just a hard working tranny  Well is he a transvestite for real?  Because transvestites are not gay  They just like women's clothing  That's right yeah  They're not  They're really just not gay  They just like  Like fucking Ed Wood  Was a transvestite  Like he loved  It made him feel closer to women  And I've worn panties once  For a girlfriend  I did  And uh  I did  No one said anything  She just reacted like  We didn't believe it 
[02:31:30]  But I didn't feel weird in him  Seriously  She blew me  She blew me through the panties  It was a bizarre thing  She was  That is really odd  Isn't it  I mean I've wrapped panties  Around my dick  And jerked off  But I've never  It happened to Billy  On the set of head of the class  Somebody just tweeted  Who's going to be the first  To make a head of the class reference  Warren Nissel  You're welcome  You creep  Mr. Billy  You're going to be  At Governor's  In Long Island  Friday 
[02:32:00]  Oh no  Began date of December 6th  Oh god  That was funny  Jimmy  Did the panties  Do anything for you  Or did they make you feel  Honest  This is the weirdest  It was a girl  Who I got to be kinky  And she  I used to get her  To dribble piss into her panties  And I would eat her  That's the truth  And I would eat her  Through the panties  It turned me on  When she would  Like pee a little bit  Holy shit  And she did it  It was the dirtiest thing  She'd ever done  She did it through her panties  Then I put the panties on  And then she blew me through them  And it felt  It felt good  It wasn't 
[02:32:30]  She blew you through her  Pissed up panties  That you were wearing  Absolutely  That's many years ago  And that was  That relationship  Fell through  It was a different  It was a different time  It was a different time  It was a different time  Pre-internet  People like that  Couldn't vote yet  But the material  This was pre-internet  Which means it was  More organic  The material felt good  It didn't feel bad  On my dick though  I didn't mind wearing them  I didn't feel gay  I feel so basic  Yeah right  You're just a meat and potatoes  Sex guy right  Just meat and potatoes  Yeah  Silk feels good  I mean 
[02:33:00]  What are you going to say  That silk doesn't feel good  Like that silky panty feel  When you get a boner  It pushes the panties out  Because they're not meant  For your male body  It's fucking great  I just feel turgid  My wife's a psychologist  And her speciality is sexuality  Oh man  So you've got to play it  Totally straight  Or she thinks you're crazy  And we have a picture  On the wall at home  Of a transvestite  And his wife  And the dog  And nobody can come  Without looking at that picture  And the woman had come  To see my wife  Because she was worried 
[02:33:30]  About her husband  Wearing her clothes  And she'd caught them  In her clothes  When she'd come home  One day  And she  My wife made it good  For them  You know  So they ended up  Going shopping together  And him buying dresses  And all that  And they're all  Very happily ever after  But the photograph's great  Because  They're both dressed as women  But the dog  Makes the pain  The dog looks really happy  In the middle  You know  They're both smiling  And happy with the situation  But the dog looks 
[02:34:00]  Absolutely delighted  He's got no clue  Things are finally okay  Around the house  What is the  Marrying someone  Who's a sexual psychologist  I mean  It could be an advantage  Because they can understand  And have tremendous intuition  Or it could be a disadvantage  Because they overly analyze  Everything you want to do  And then they just do things  To appease you  As opposed to doing it  Because they genuinely  Are a pig  Yeah that would be  Right  I want the genuine pig  I do too  I need a genuine filth bag  I can't have a girl  Who's nice  And trying to be nice to me  It's weird 
[02:34:30]  You know  Nothing much happens  No  You know  They don't mix the work  And the life  But you're not  The weirdest thing is  The books that are lying around  You know  You realize there's guys  Who fuck trees  And stuff like that  You know  I was hoping  When I'm in the countryside  I come across  Some guy shagging a bus  You know  You would have to check that out  But my favorite  Are the guys 
[02:35:00]  Who bought a little hole  In the ground  And fuck that  Yes  Wow  What?  Earth fuckers?  Fuck the world  Fuck the world  That's a real thing  Literally fucking the world  In mud  Wow  They're my favorite  I like them  That's an odd thing  You gotta have someone do that  I can't have anything inanimate  I don't want to see that  No  I remember hearing stories  Like when I was in India  That people would  Like in these small villages  They would get like a mayonnaise jar  And fill it with like meat  Yeah sure  And then they would just  We've all heard stuff like that  And serve it later  I've never heard mud before  Oh my god 
[02:35:30]  Mayonnaise on your meat  No there's no mayonnaise in the jar  Just the jar full of meat  And it's so hot there  That the meat heats up  And it feels like a big moist veg  Wow  Where was this?  In India  Oh my  It's called marinating there  This is really spicy  Try it  That's fucked up  There's your chicken on rice  I think you just made that up  No  That was just something I heard  Don't you get embarrassed sometimes  As a guy  When you hear about  What guys do to get off 
[02:36:00]  Like when women hear this  And I know women are pigs too  It shows them their place  You're replaceable  With this fucking  Meat filled mayonnaise jar  So shut your face  Sometimes you're looking up  Oh god  They're doing their shit too though  No but I mean  It's things like  Alright sex crimes  Like I'm watching a show on TV  About some fucking horrific sex crime  It's a home video  Like I survived  We called it Christmas  That show I survived  Is always  Like a guy 
[02:36:30]  Is either being attacked  By a bear  Or he's fallen off  Of something  In the woods  And has to crawl out  That's his survival story  And a woman  It's always rape  Rapity rape  Rape  It's constantly  Her survival story  Always involves rape  It does though  I'm being careful  But it does  Always involves rape  And when I'm watching this  In mixed company  Sometimes I'm thinking  Come on kids  God that's so like  Like they gotta be looking like  God you guys 
[02:37:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you  She's looking at you  In the tent  In the front of your pants  What is this  What is this  Inexplicable erection  No it's the story  About the guy  Being attacked by the bear  I swear  I got a bear fetish  Yeah yeah  No it's just like  I always think  That a girl  Is gonna look  And just be like  Fucking guys man  It's just  They're disgusting  The thing that bugs me is  If you bring up  The very subject of rape  And you're not supposed  To be funny about it  And all that  And I understand it perfectly 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  But then  If you're on a talk show  And you're talking about  Someone who's going to jail  And you say  I hope some  Mexican transvestite  Fucks him up the ass  Right  In ten minutes  The audience applauds  Prison rape is  Absolutely fine  It's true  Billy  It's perfectly acceptable  And hilarious  Yes  It's a victimless crime  Yeah it really is  It's additional punishment  Slay him down  Barkley's on her  Yes  That's always baffled me 
[02:38:00]  Yeah  Because it's nightman-ish  It would be  Wouldn't it  Yeah  Wow that would be terrible  But I think people  Feel so detached  From that whole  Prison life thing  Like oh  It ain't gonna happen to me  That it's safe  To joke about  In the general public  With rape  You're like  You know  Hey come on  Everybody's a  Fair game  And threatened by it  And you know  You don't want that  Happening to a loved one  Or anything  But suppose you're  On a demonstration  To stop the killing 
[02:38:30]  Of wild flowers  Uh huh  On the public square  Or something  Innocent like that  And you all get  Hauled off in the van  And you get  Fucked up the ass  I don't think  Free your trouble  I don't think  You're protesting  The flowers  Prisoners  Go with the  Hardened rapist  Well I think  The hardened rapist  Look forward  To the flower guys  They want to  Deflower them  Yeah  Here come the pansies  Yeah  Woo  Yeah be it's Christmas  It's just  I don't know  That prison thing 
[02:39:00]  Is  And anybody  That I've ever  Spoken to  We've had people  Guests on the show  That have been  In a prison  And things like that  No one  No one will admit it  No one ever  Fesses up to  Knowing anybody  Or prison rape  Do you know what I think  Might have gotten raped  And he talked about  It was  We had Damien Echols on  And we didn't ask him  We should have  He was one of the guys  The West Memphis Three  Falsely convicted  Of child murder  He spent 18 years in jail  Three guys  And you know  They're out now  But I believe  He was  He's on death row  Might have been  I think he got raped  Did we touch on that  We might have touched on it 
[02:39:30]  But we didn't  The guy raping him  Touched on it  Oh yeah  A lot  I think we steered clear  Yeah we weren't brave enough  To ask him in the end  In the end  In the end  Well you don't want to  Embarrass somebody  You don't want to  We were sort of going  In that direction  And then we all  Kind of like  Took the right turn  And bailed  Out of the situation  Because it's an  Uncomfortable thing  How do you ask somebody  Is it in his book  It wasn't in his book  It was in his ass  Is that what you've been reading 
[02:40:00]  This book smells like shit  It's an asshole Anthony  Damn  Weird library  Do you really have  32 fucking albums out  Wow  Me  Yeah  I don't think so  32 fucking albums  No it says  He's released 32 comedy albums  And 5 DVDs  It's on the prep sheet  Wow  Really  That's amazing right  It's like I don't know  Maybe I do  I have no clue  What year was your first album  60 something 
[02:40:30]  Come on  Wow  You did a comedy album  In the 60s  Well I did an album  I used to be in a band  The Humble Bums  With Jerry Rafferty  Who's Jerry Rafferty  Jerry Rafferty  Jerry Rafferty  Baker Street  Yeah  You were in a band  With Baker Street  Hold on let me see  Baker to him  He's got it  There's a good chance  Jerry Rafferty's on my phone  That's very impressive  Billy can't hear the music 
[02:41:00]  He's hearing the music  He's hearing Anthony's version  Now do right down the line  Right down the line  I like Jerry Rafferty  The master of the pan flute  I like Jerry Rafferty  He passed away last year  What's better way to honor that man 
[02:41:30]  Than by playing that awful slide whistle song  On the stupid slide whistle  That's a shrunny whistle  I want to get a pan flute  Like Zamfier  You could be the master  I met his ex-wife  You met Zamfier  But it's the way you said it  Like watch this  Right  I met his ex-wife  I know De Niro  But it was the strangest thing  I was going for my green card  I was going for my green card  So I had to go to Montreal  To the U.S. Embassy in Montreal  And I was there waiting 
[02:42:00]  For my green card signatures thing  And then the lady helping me  She was like  Oh yeah  I'm a big fan  And you know  My ex-husband's a performer too  Oh  And I'm like  Let's say that  No way  And I was like  Wow  Who's your ex-husband?  Zamfier  You've never heard of him  I go Zamfier  The master of the pan flute  Yeah  And she was like  Yeah we were married  For like 25 years  Wow  And now he lives in Switzerland  With his young 25 year old girlfriend  Oh yeah  And you got in the naturalization line  And she got in the line  I got around  Like waiting  Because this chick was a fan 
[02:42:30]  And fucking Zamfier's wife  Where's that Zamfier money?  Why the fuck  Well that's  Apparently she didn't get paid  Damn  He's the master of the  Iron clad prenup  You should have asked  If he was good at oral  Like did he pull some of those  Weird tricks?  You know  You never want to follow up with it  Yeah  You were trying to figure out  How to verbalize it  I want to know what Jimmy  You know  What line was she going in?  You got cut off 
[02:43:00]  I really didn't know  It was going to be something mean  About Zamfier  It was not going to be  A complimentary line  That she stood in  You were in the immigration line  The weirdest thing  About that instrument  Is it looks as if  You've got Parkinson's disease  When you play it  Yes you got a shake  Yeah yeah  That was a fad  For about 10 minutes  That Zamfier  Are you a good banjo player?  I guess you are  I'm okay  Do you still play?  Yeah  Have you ever battled Steve Martin?  Yeah  Have you?  Amazing  Are you better than him or no?  No he's better than me 
[02:43:30]  He's pretty god damn good  They were nominated for a Grammy this year  Him and his band for bluegrass  Yeah he's a great composer  For bluegrass as well  He composes a lot of good music  For him yeah  His new album's brilliant  Is it?  Can you play the ukulele?  Yeah  Oh you're pretty god damn good  Hey that quartet thing  Did you have to sing?  Did you have to sing barbershop?  Well it was weird  We went for singing lessons  And then we did the song  And then they replaced it  They were like  Sweet Adola  Sweet Adola 
[02:44:00]  All that shit  Yeah you did that?  Yeah  But they replaced it?  Yeah  Oh man  They told you  They told you you can't sing pretty much  No it was a great idea  We thought it was great  Because we sounded like shit  You know  Because we're supposed to be old  And past it  Oh okay  And we keep talking about it  That we can't do it anymore  Uh huh  So when we eventually do it  It's all raggedy assed  And then I think it was Dustin's son Jake  Said to him 
[02:44:30]  At the end when the titles are going up  You shouldn't even see them singing  Just put in the voices  And they put in these voices  And so it's very optimistic  Ah so it sounds a lot better  Yeah  And they're not seeing you guys  Oh okay  Because if you put us in  It would be sad  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  What's the actual gist of the thing  Is it you guys are in an old folks home  I'm just showing you how they get along  In the old folks home  You know  And I'm a horny old guy 
[02:45:00]  Oh okay  And the rest are sort of frustrated  Sort of soloists and stuff  Are you banging any of the old broads  In the old folks home there?  No  But I'm talking about it all the time  Oh you're just talking about it  Although they tell me  That because of Viagra  These people are all shagging their brains out  In old folks homes  Yeah I think they are  I think that's actually  And the one of the problem  Was sexually transmitted diseases  In old folks homes 
[02:45:30]  Yeah how great is that?  The golden years  You're fucking  You get syphilis  You're fucking white shoes on  At that age who gives a fuck?  At that age who gives a fuck?  Get it all  Who cares?  Yeah really  That's true  Isn't it dried in there?  You would think  See the Viagra gives the guy the hard on  But what?  The woman doesn't want to have sex anymore  She needs Niagara  The guys  That's fucking good  That's a good one  The women must be just horrified  That these guys are walking around  With their fucking rods 
[02:46:00]  Wanting to have sex  It's terrible  But I think the whole thing  Needs to be looked at again  Old folks homes  They give them drugs  And don't let them drink  And all that  I'd say  Fill them with whiskey and drugs  Fuck yeah  They are a little crazy though right?  I mean  Headphones  And play the music of their youth  You know  Just until they fucking fade away  Yeah  Enjoy your twilight  What do you think they should be doing?  Partying?  Yeah  Or anybody  It's open for discussion  Is this a radio format? 
[02:46:30]  They should let them party obviously  They should actually  Yeah  It would be nice for them  To have a good time in there  My mom's in assisted living  And these people are fucking  Bored out of their minds  Playing stupid bingo  And watching some dumb movie  From the you know  The 40s  That's all they got  The children want them unsupervised  Fuck I  Yeah why not?  Put some slow machines in there  You know  They live their lives  Why not?  My mom's 71  And she  She goes to Vegas all the time  She's still rocking huh?  Yeah  Dr. Steve just texted me  That he sent me a pan flute  From Amazon.com 
[02:47:00]  Enjoy  Nice  I'll be  I'll be rocking that pan flute  In this motherfucker  And your fucking ex-wife  Is going to be working  On immigration in no time  Fuck her  And Zamfir's ex-wife  That you're so thrilled  To have met  It was like  Because you know  To me he was so mystical  He was very mystical  I didn't think he was  I didn't think he was so shallow  As to dump his old wife  And get a young chippy  That's what made me laugh  About the whole thing  Exactly  Yeah that is great  You know you  You think the master  Of the pan flute  Would be the spiritual human  He's just as big a dick 
[02:47:30]  As everyone else  Fuck you bitch  I got a new one  Yeah  He upgraded  He was living a rock and roll lifestyle  With his pan flute  So blow me  He said  He was like blow me  He's fucking playing  Hit the road jack  On fucking  Yeah  See if I can swing it  Makes it all nice  I'm so impressed  Do you need a new member 
[02:48:00]  In the band  Yeah right  How long have you had that thing  Oh forever  Forever  I'm very musical  That's brilliant  I'm very musical  I've never seen a classy one  Like that  No I know  There was plastic right  Plastic little pieces  Yeah I don't know why  Somebody got me  This really nice one  The best part of that  Is whenever he walks out  Of the studio  We all put it in our assholes  Good welcome to herpes  In the ass  Didn't burglars 
[02:48:30]  Used to do that  With your toothbrush  I heard that rumor  I don't know  That's a burglar  With a sense of humor  Yeah  I'm going to rob you  But you're also  Going to be robbed  Of your dignity  The gimmick is  You would rob everything  And leave two things  In their hotel room  The toothbrush  And their camera  And then they would  Go about their business  Brushing their teeth  Before digital cameras  I gather  Because they would have to  Go and have the film developed  But they would be  Brushing their teeth  In the interim  The days that go by  And they'd get the film back  Look through the pictures 
[02:49:00]  And see the shot  Of the burglar guy  With the toothbrush  Up his ass  And know that they've  Been using  Said toothbrush  No one ever did  It might have happened once  Somebody might have done  To a friend  It's a great gag  Yeah  I'm sure someone  Did it to a friend  Yeah  I took the camera  Toothbrush in the  In the bathroom  During a party  Shoved up his ass  People used to  Wander along the beach  And find piles of clothes  And a camera  And they would just  Whip their shorts down  And take a picture  Of the dick  And put the camera  Put the camera back down 
[02:49:30]  Yeah we used to do it  At weddings  Jim  I remember one time  Somebody walked in  But me and Florentino  I think it was me and Florentino  We were in a bathroom stall  He's another comedian  Of course you were  And I was bent over  With my asshole open  And he was taking a picture  With one of those  Table wedding cameras  And somebody walked in  But that's the best  They have to develop it  And fuck it  Yeah the old days  You realize how many things  Changed with cameras  Because now it's just instant  You can't really fuck with anybody  Like when someone says  Oh could you take a picture  And you cut their head off 
[02:50:00]  Or you just zoom in  On the person's dick  And take it  Because they get it right back  And go oh you're an asshole  And do it again  Yeah do it again  But you didn't get that  Online where they're like  Oh this didn't come out  Could we take another picture  That's really ruined  The live comedy experience  When you do the meet and greet  It used to be  They would just take your picture  And keep going  Right  Now the line  Like you're late  For your own second show  Because they take a picture  And go oh my god  My boobs look so weird  Let's do it again  It didn't come out  Because they take your picture  And they look  And they're unhappy  With their photo with you  As they're not buying merch 
[02:50:30]  And not everyone  Had a fucking creeps  Buy a shirt you asshole  And not everyone  Had a camera  Back then either  Correct  Not everyone brought  A fucking camera to a show  The best way to do it  The Louisville Improv  They had one guy  That works at the club  He goes I'll take all the pictures  I give people a number  Then they go to the club's  Facebook page  And cut like 40 minutes  Out of my night  Fuck that's great  I didn't like that  Did you know they had  The Colonel Sanders guy  In the lobby  Was he there that weekend  No  I just did it  And they had  Fucking a Colonel Sanders  Impersonator  Standing in the lobby  Of the Louisville  Louis Improv  Really 
[02:51:00]  But when I was there  I saw Colonel Sanders  One day  You look in a mirror  I saw his ex-wife  I was playing  The sound of his flute  I actually saw him  In the bulldog  The story  Nice guy or what  Is he a nice guy  He's always talking  To other people  Every time a pastor  Could hear  $7,000  $8,000  $8,000  $8,000  $8,000  $8,000  But it was the real guy 
[02:51:30]  It was the real guy  It was in the 70s  Yeah well  Was he dressed like  Colonel Sanders  Yes  Oh no  He's a tension whoring  If he's Colonel Sanders  He's dressed as Colonel Sanders  He went everywhere  Dressed like that  Oh what a fucking bull  And the irony is  Billy started to look  Like Colonel Sanders  Exactly  Absolutely  Yeah  Isn't that kind of  A politically incorrect thing  Like the old  Plantation Colonel  Kind of a thing  Oh shit  I mean if you really  Analyze it  If you do 
[02:52:00]  Which I do  Everything race  Race related  I overanalyze  Hatred is exhausting  As we said yesterday  My hatred  It's tiring  It tires you out  It tires me out  On a daily basis  It's a draining drug  So tired  I actually put my shirt  On backwards today  It's because I was getting  Dressed in the dark  Because I have no power  At my fucking house  But why when you're  Flipping around by now  Who gives a shit  I fucking reached a point  I don't care  He hasn't had power  In ten days  Billy  It's inside out  No power for ten days 
[02:52:30]  I haven't had power for ten days  Because of the  Superstorm  Hurricane  And then last night  We had a snowstorm  And I fucking had it  You know how to stay  With Roland  At the El Rancho Motel  You know what  It's a great idea  Roland's a fun guy  I can't understand Roland  When he speaks  So I'd be going crazy  Well he doesn't  I live out on Long Island  It's about  Yeah  Thirty miles or so  East of here  And it got  Just devastating  My friend in Hicksville  Still doesn't have power  Trees are everywhere 
[02:53:00]  Trees fell on top  Of every wire  Around  And in my neighborhood  I haven't seen  Any power people  And the gas shortage  Now because  The gas tankers  Couldn't get in  So the lines are crazy  And the generators  All run on gasoline  So it's  It's Mad Max out there  It's the fucking road warrior  It's crazy  Yeah  I mean I'm lucky  Because my house  Is still standing  Some people  Their houses were destroyed  Washed away  Trees fell on them  People died  So I mean  I'm keeping my complaining  Relative 
[02:53:30]  Yeah  But ten days  Without fucking power  You get a little  Shaq-wacky  You know  I'm telling you  The weird  The screen  Did Phil Jackson  Coined that phrase  Shaq-wacky  Fourth quarter  We're going to go  To the Shaq-wacky  But yeah  You said relatively  I was at a meeting once  And I said to somebody  I had such a headache  She goes  Well my friend  Just found out  She had cancer  That's literally  What the person  Said to me  You got one-upped  In a meeting  So I just  What?  You got one-upped  In a meeting 
[02:54:00]  I did  And I looked at the lady  And the only thing  To say was  Well I still have a headache  Because there wasn't  The person in front of me  And I was like  You think you got a headache?  I just found out  My friend has cancer  I go  Well I still have a headache  Exactly  That doesn't change things  So maybe we should get  Some chemo  For this headache  Jesus Christ  That's terrible  I still have a headache  That's the only answer  You had really  It's a good one  I don't care about your friend  I had a heckler  Say that to me one time  I was at Bananas in Poughkeepsie 
[02:54:30]  And there was a table of women  And they were just being rude  Just fucking  So I just smashed them  And the one woman  We wouldn't stop talking  I think I called her a condor  But she was being awful  She was being awful  And her friend went  She has cancer  She has breast cancer  Oh no  Why would you throw fuel  Like that out?  I know  Why would you  Oh god  Jimmy of all people  I know right  Jimmy's salivated  But I mean  What did you do?  I think I said  I didn't care  I mean I didn't  I didn't make fun of the cancer 
[02:55:00]  Right  But that's irrelevant  She's fucking being rude  She's fucking being rude  You haven't hit a heckler  Sure  What's that?  No I've never had a physical  It's the most wonderful  Life enhancing  I've done this  Oh man  In June  In June in fact  Really  I want to know the story  Hell yeah  I want to hear this  What happened Billy?  Billy what happened?  It's wonderful  It's a guy  He kept shouting  For a song called  I was playing my banjo  Now the banjo  Doesn't have a lot of songs 
[02:55:30]  About fixing heroin  Yeah  You know it's mostly  About chicken pie  And stuff like that  It's more upbeat  There's a rabbit in the log  This is chicken pie  It's a raccoon up the tree  And I don't know  How to get it down  Right  There you go  These are the problems  Let's not get so deep  With a banjo  Right  But this  I was in the middle of it  And this guy shouted  Needle of death  Needle of death  Which is a song  By a guy called Bert Yange  And I said 
[02:56:00]  Look I'm a banjo player  I don't know  Needle of death anyway  I don't know the words  Needle of death  And I said  I don't know it  If I knew it  I'd gladly sing it for you  Happily  And it would sound weird  In the banjo  But I would soldier on  Right  Needle of death  Soldier on  Okay  Needle of death  I don't know the fucking thing  How can I sing it 
[02:56:30]  If I don't know it  End of story  Now stop it  Needle of death  I said  Please  Do me a favor  Just stay exactly where you are  Excuse me  Excuse me  Excuse me  Are you the guy  Bosh  Wow  Yeah  That's fantastic  And he was the treasurer  I didn't get paid  He was the treasurer  For the club  So he said  Fist of death  How great is that 
[02:57:00]  Fist of fun  What an asshole  I've never struck a heckler  Russell did  I want to hear about this  I did in June  Why  Where were you  Laugh factory  In LA  I was on stage  About to close it up  And I hear  All I hear  Is fuck Indians  And I'm like  There's a cowboy  In the audience  That's awkward  The whole audience  Was like  What the fuck  It was a cow  Did he live for me  They like it too  Jimmy was right  And I was like  What

[02:58:00]  If he was a young guy  But he was like  My age  I'm like  Asian panhandle  Where was this  Laugh factory  On yeah  On Sunset  Yeah  I saw you  Great in there once  Wow  Thank you  You did a smashing thing  About filming yourself  Having sex  Yeah  Oh  Yeah  You got it  Yeah  You're watching TV  And then you said  Oh guess me  Yeah  And also you want to watch  Porno on a big screen TV  Because you can make believe  You're next  Because everybody's  Regular size  You just wait for somebody 
[02:58:30]  To reach out of the  Out of the screen  And tag you in  Yeah  Actual size shit  Is pretty good  Yeah you just wait  For the girl to move her  So you can get over  And under the horse  I tripped on that  But it was a whole  Fucking joke  So basically  The content  Of animal fucking  Made up to my clumsiness  If there was audio  Twitter  I would retweet that shit  I would  Fucking lummox  So you  So you punch me  To the face  What happened  No I walked off stage  Mad  And then the club  Was like sorry 
[02:59:00]  About that guy  He was drunk  And causing problems  And so we kicked him out  I was  So I was like  Alright  I wait about 20 minutes  Because I'm like  I know if I go outside  And see this guy  I'm gonna fucking hit him  Yeah  So I wait  And I go alright  I'm leaving now  I walk out the front  Of the fucking guy  Sitting right there  Right there  And as I walk  I don't know he's there  I walk out  And he leans in  And he's like  Hey no hard feelings  With a smirk  But as soon as he leans in  I had sparred that day  So I immediately  I immediately sidestepped  Through a right hand 
[02:59:30]  And it didn't hit  The way I wanted it to  Instead of hitting flush  It hit the last two knuckles  So it was like  The right hand  And then immediately  Bam with the left hook  Right in the mouth  And then his teeth  Went right through my knuckles  How good did that feel  Amazing  Yeah  Isn't it nice  It's awesome  I was more impressed  With myself  That it was like  Throw the right hand  Follow the left hook  It's a lovely feeling  Oh it was years  Years and years  Of assholes  Hooray  Boosh  And then he tried  Suing me  Hooray  Boom  But I was defending myself 
[03:00:00]  Because I don't know  Of course  You're fucking glaring at me  You have a friend with you  How do I know  It's gonna happen  That's it  Yeah  And he comes towards you  After yelling at you  Fuck Indians  Did he knock him out  Yeah I believe  He flew right off the chair  Are like Indians  Pretty much known  As very peaceful  Nice people  Yeah but I grew up  With the blacks  The Sikhs  The Sikhs  The Sikhs  The Sikhs  I've never had a problem  With an Indian  I mean the cab drivers  I will yell horrific things  When they cut  You guys are from Bangladesh  It's not India  But they're not Indian  Right  Right  Were they Sikhs 
[03:00:30]  From Bangladesh  No they're not Sikhs  Sikhs are only from India  I know  They're from Bangladesh  So they're  They don't count  You know what I'm saying  Billy  It's like calling a Scottish guy  An English guy  You would get very upset  But I have seen  The guys with the turbans  The Sikhs  With the turbans  They're not an American  They're Canadian  That's right  I've had some pretty big fights  Canadian Americans  Even worse  Oh boy  We don't mind  Because we kind of go  Eh  Eh  What are the Persians  Problem with Indians  It wasn't the Persians  It was this one guy  Oh I thought maybe 
[03:01:00]  This was some fucking  Tribal shit  Not at all  Some real fucking  Some real grease bullshit  How many hecklers  Have you punched Billy?  Just the one  That's the one good one  Another guy  I put the money  In his mouth  It was in the early days  I was only being paid  About seven pounds  Or something  Which is what  Fifteen bucks  That's what Russell's  Balls weigh  And he gave me  And he said  And you weren't worth  A penny of it  And I said  Oh really  And he was next 
[03:01:30]  To a pinball machine  And I pushed him over it  And stuffed the money  In his mouth  Nice  He rocks worth a fortune  And it was worth  Every penny  It's true  What year did you start  Stand up?  About  Well it's difficult to say  I was in the 60s  I started in folk music  And it kind of gradually  Jesus  Eased its way into  Leaving the banjo home  And just  Oh kind of like  You know  Just stepping out  Without it  Yeah  But what would you do  Like jokes in between songs  And that got longer and longer  Yes  And it grew and grew  And then  The first night I did it  I kept the banjo 
[03:02:00]  Over at the side  So as I could see it  And run for it  Just in case  Yeah  You run out of  I left it there for a few weeks  Yeah  Did you know Arnold Brown?  Yes I knew Arnold Brown  He was very funny  He was a  Not very well  He was lovely  Scottish guy  He was very funny  Scottish Jewish guy  A Scottish Jewish accountant  Interesting  Was he a comedian?  Yeah  And he wore a big overcoat  He was a weird guy  He was a weird guy  I loved him  I used to gig with him  Back in England  Back in the day  I don't know any of those guys  There's so many great comics  From England and Scotland  That I just 
[03:02:30]  I meet them at festivals  Like you know  Jimmy Carr I like a lot  And I've talked about him  And there's a bunch of  Lee Evans we've had on  Sean Mio's really funny too  I don't know Sean  Do you know Sean?  Who?  Sean Mio?  No I don't know  I probably know his face  Yeah probably you do  You did a gig with him in Canada  He doesn't remember  Arnold Brown said  It was weird living in Glasgow  He said because  My father didn't drink  Which was very unusual  In Glasgow he said  And it was embarrassing  On a Friday night  Watching him being  Thrown into bars  That's pretty good 
[03:03:00]  I like him  He had a strange way  Of doing his jokes  He was very quirky  He said I was walking  Down the street  And two pork chops  Were walking towards me  So I jumped and hid  In the bushes  Until they passed  Because my mother  Told me to always avoid  Fatty foods  Right?  Sounds like a real headliner  Well he was one of those guys  And I don't want to put him down 
[03:03:30]  But he's a guy  Who never went professional  And so he would do  Things like that  Because he had his job  To go to in the morning  Yeah he didn't care  Yeah  Never really had a  That goal of grandeur  No it's just  It's that daring  That when  This is all you've got  It gives you a certain  Daring I think  Hmm  You have to  Be up there  With the action  You can't do  The pork chop shit  You know  You've got to bring  Your A game  Absolutely 
[03:04:00]  Every day  It's true  The pork chop jokes  Won't fly  Pork chop  Have you ever seen  Jerry Sadowitz?  Yeah I remember  Jerry Sadowitz  Remember when he got  Punched in the face  In Montreal  In Canada yeah  Why did he get punched?  He called them  Moose fuckers  He opens up  Good evening  Moose fuckers  And then some French guy  Just gets up  Walks on stage  And punches him  In the face  He was a nice guy  Jerry Sadowitz  I met him a few times  Yeah I never met 
[03:04:30]  The guy  Jim Jeffries got  Punched on stage  So that made it  Like to the  Yeah it was a big  Internet video  Yeah some guy  Just ran up  In England  He looked like  He was like  And the guy  Just threw a punch  In his head  And then Jeffries  Just cowers  Just fucking  Cowers on the stage  And the guy  Keeps hitting him  And then I guess  He realized  I got to do something  So he tries to get up  And hit the guy  But by that time  Yeah Jim Jeffries  Reacted like  Vicky LaMotta  And he was  Fucking punched  I got beaten up  In Australia  In Brisbane  Did you? 
[03:05:00]  In the 60s  Yeah  The guy said  I'll never forget it  He said  My wife's ears  Are not garbage cans  Oh  Oh no  What did you say  Oh boy  And he swung at me  And I had a big  Long beard in those days  And he obviously  Thought my chin  Came to the end of it  And it didn't  So it went bend  Right through it  Yeah  I said  Is that the best  You can do  And he said  No  And head butted me  Oh  They love that  Fucking head butt  He Scottished you  And I landed  In my boots  And then  In those days  I wore tights 
[03:05:30]  And bananas  Boots  These boots  That look like bananas  And a leotard  Oh Jesus  And I was hauled  Backstage  And it was a  Kind of fascist state  In those days  Brisbane  And somebody  Phoned the police  And said  There's trouble  Down at the guild hall  And there's a fight  And they came rushing in  And saw me  And said  That's obviously the guy  And so they beat  The shit out of me  Jesus  Did you try to explain  Your case  And it took me years  To get back again  Oh they banned you  No I was scared to go  Oh  You banned you 
[03:06:00]  I banned you  Wow  Does that feel like  Physical confrontations  You've had with  Audience members  That's a bit  It's still  It's rare  But when it happens  It's frightening  Because you know  It's like you can't see  It coming from the stage  A lot of times  If you're looking one way  It's always scary to me  That someone's gonna  Throw a bottle or something  People always just talk shit  That's why  I think the trouble  With the heckling  Is he doesn't know  That you don't know  What he's saying  Yeah  Because from where you're standing  It just sounds like  And all it does  Is spoil what you're doing 
[03:06:30]  Yeah it fucks up your time  It makes you angry  Assholes  God what assholes  I hit a guy in the stomach  In Lebanon  In April  That makes him crazy  You know what it is  Comedy violence  From around the world  People of our radio show  You can't go crazy  You can't touch your stomach  I have a theory  People that have never  Been punched in the face  Are the first ones  To lip off  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Because they don't  Understand consequence  So I'm at a bar  In Beirut  And this guy's like  Oh my god 
[03:07:00]  He's like  What are you doing in here  And I go  Just hanging out  It's like a little  Dive bar  And he goes  Well I would  I would expect  That you'd be  In a high class  Club  And I'm like  No I like  Regular things like this  He goes  Really a cocky  Motherfucker like you  As soon as he said  That I went  Boom  Left hook right in his ribs  And he was like  He literally  He literally went  And then he looked at me  With little tears in his eyes  And I go  Don't fucking call me 
[03:07:30]  A cocky motherfucker  You don't know me  He's like  That hurt  I go yeah  Yeah no shit  He actually said  That hurt  Yeah  It is  The first time  You get your fucking  Literally your bell rung  Because the first time  I got hit in the head  And just heard  Boom  And you don't know  You don't want that  To happen again  Yeah I've been hit a lot  So I know  I don't mouth off to people  Right  Yeah  Because there's no need  To get hit again  Did you ever see  The program  Where Tyson  Was in charge of it  And it was about  Knockouts  Great knockouts 
[03:08:00]  Oh I've seen  A bunch  A compilation  Of great knockouts  From Tyson  And all of them said  It was a very pleasant feeling  Really  Yeah none of them said  It was painful  They just said  It was  It's like going to sleep  They don't remember being hit  They just remember  Oh  That probably happens so fast  I remember getting  Knocked out in the ring  Really  Do you remember it hurting  It doesn't hurt  It hurts the next day  The next day  Do you feel nauseous  I guess you get a concussion  You get nauseous right  Well no  I just  You get hit here  Your jaw hurts  On the other side  Oh 
[03:08:30]  And then the next day  You kind of got a dull headache  And stuff  But when it's happening  Why don't we do a gig  When we just heckle the audience  Fuck you guys  Come on and go  Shut the fuck up  What's the needle song  Death needle  Needle of death  Needle of death  Just yell it at the audience  Just scream it at them  Until they all leave  Fucking just yell at them  This is needle of death  That's  That's fucked up  Yeah  If you're not knocked out though  It fucking hurts  And it sucks  It shocks you 
[03:09:00]  It shocks you  Yeah yeah  Yeah that's annoying  It's annoying  Yeah  I can't imagine  Anybody punching me  In the nose  Well imagine my fucking nose  Are you still boxing  Are you still boxing  I am yeah  Still sparring  Damn you still get hit  Yeah  You still let people hit you  Do you still compete  No no I just train  Yeah  My coach is a former world champ  So he takes it easy on me  Who's your coach  Ricky Kilos  And when you did my podcast  Kung Lee was staying on your couch  Kung Lee was staying in my house  Why don't you give him the bed  Since he's Kung Lee 
[03:09:30]  No he had a bed  He had a bed  He's fighting on Saturday Kung Lee  Who's he fighting  Rich Franklin  He's going to beat the shit out of him  Yeah I think he'll beat Franklin too  Although Franklin  Knocked out Liddell with a broken arm  I'm just throwing it in my opinion  Because I know fucking  That's a tough fight  You know  It's a tough fight that one  What does Chipper think  Who's going to win that fight  I don't know  King Kung Lee  Everybody else on the internet  Is picking Franklin  Well you know what that means  Oh but Kung Lee  Yeah  Kung Lee's going to beat him  I wouldn't know  Yeah because  What they don't realize 
[03:10:00]  Is Kung's trainer Scott  Used to be Franklin's trainer  Back in the day  Well I knew that  So he's got insider trading  You train with headgear on right  Yeah  And do you still get  Kind of a little rocked  Yeah I mean  He doesn't like  He's not trying to kill me in there  Yeah  He only goes in on me  If I get cocky  Oh really okay  Like whenever we touch gloves  My first punch  Is always a jab  And a left hook right away  Uh huh  And then he'll always be like  Oh  And then he'll beat me up  For the next minute and a half 
[03:10:30]  To remind me that  Don't get too cute  That he's not some heckler  Outside the club  Yeah just remember  Remember this dummy  I'm training you  You're not training me  Alright so he'll  And you'll feel good  And you'll feel good for that  First jab and a hook  But then after that  You're on your bicycle  And then he'll stop  When I'm running away  The whole time  Yeah  And he'll take his mouth guard  Like throw punches  When you're running away  And then he'll put his mouth guard  Back in and keep chasing me  Wow that's fucking  Uh I don't know  I don't like getting hit  I hate being hit  I don't like getting hit  But you get hit in there 
[03:11:00]  But you put your  In a controlled environment  So when you're on the street  You can avoid getting hit  I don't know  I'd rather shoot someone  Isn't so much the guys  That get knocked out  When I'm watching boxing  It's the guys  That are just constantly jabbed  Oh yeah the guys  That are getting beaten up  Yeah there's a difference  There's a difference  Between getting knocked out  And getting beat up  Yeah  You're better off  Getting knocked out  Right  Sure  Yeah and Larry Holmes  Putting that big fucking left  In your face  For nine rounds  Oh jeez  No Larry Holmes  Threw a big left  You can take that to the bank 
[03:11:30]  Alright  That's my contribution  Larry Holmes  Threw a good punch  Fucking 49-0  What about Foreman  Imagine getting hit  With that shit  Yeah  Yeah  That would be awful  We had Tyson in here  Did you?  One of the funniest guys  When would you have him?  A month ago  Two months ago  I've never met Tyson  He was great  He was here for like 45 minutes  He was amazing  My wife almost fought Mike Tyson  At a yogurt shop  Oh Pinkberry in Studio City?

[03:22:30]  Paul  I've seen a future brother  It is murder  It is murder  Things don't slide  Slide in all directions  More and up  Won't be nothing  You can't measure anymore  The blizzard  The blizzard of the world  Is crossed the threshold  And it's overturned 
[03:23:00]  The order of the soul  When they say  Repent  Repent  Repent  Repent  Repent  I wonder what they mean  When they say  Repent  Repent  Repent  Repent  Repent  I wonder what they mean  When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant. 
[03:23:30]  Give me that burning wall, give me stone and sing up, give me Christ or give me Hiroshima.  Destroy another fetus now, we don't let children in and out, I've seen the future, baby, it is murder. 
[03:24:00]  Things are gonna slide, in all directions, won't be nothing, nothing you can't measure anymore.  The blizzard, the blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold, and it's overturned the order of the soul. 
[03:24:30]  When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.  When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.  When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant. 
[03:25:00]  When they say, repent, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM on demand.  After ONA Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:25:30]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, Sam Roberts here with you.  Yes.  What's up, big boy?  How come you don't do a Sam Roberts impression?  I don't really have one yet.  You're working on it.  Why am I half-breed?  I giggle a lot.  How's it going, Jay Moore?  It's going well.  Why are they going to set up all these flags when you're doing your thing?  I like it.  I think it creates an ambiance.  Is it literally just to cover up Opie and Anthony with Ron and Fez stuff? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  It's like when the Jets play at Giant Stadium, they've got to paint everything green for the day?  Yeah, and do you see the, I don't know, the rug behind you?  Yeah.  Like, they lay out a Ron and Fez rug over the Opie and Anthony rug.  So they're like the Clippers and the Jets.  Yeah.  They just cover up the arena.  Sam just says yes.  The Clippers and the Jets, they don't even play the same sport.  Well, yeah, but they're both like visitors in their own building.  Like the Jets for years.  See, the Jets, I understood the reference.  I didn't even know the Clippers played in the same arena as somebody else.  The Jets played at Giant Stadium. 
[03:26:30]  I know that.  So every time there was a Jets game, they had to put green bunting all over everything blue in the world.  And the Clippers now play at Staples Center, which was the home of the Lakers for so long.  That one I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I knew that the Lakers played in the Staples Center.  I had no idea that's where the Clippers played.  I was laying in bed last night, and I thought a stone-cold E.T.  It's the funniest thing in the world.  And I laughed so hard, I farted.  And my wife goes, are you in her sleep?  He goes, are you okay?  I'm literally laying there.  What part of it did it? 
[03:27:00]  What part?  He's looking down.  When he looks down to drive.  But every frame of that is so funny.  Have you watched it again?  Yeah, I watched it like 40 times.  And then literally every time there's a great comedy video on YouTube, it's always disappointing to me.  Even the rent, the landlord, Will Ferrell and stuff, there's lulls.  I'm like, God, they could have tightened this up.  That guy in his car. 
[03:27:30]  Stone-cold E.T.  Even when he drives.  You like, that's what I was going to say.  You like the gap when he's going from the ordering.  Yeah, because it's motion.  It's like hysterical motion.  It's fucking E.T.  Because he looks like he's driving entirely too fast.  The window.  The window.  Oh, my God.  I also love that you can see his jaw moving under the mask.  So it's like E.T.  My favorite is when he puts his hand out like he's holding a burger and he goes, and I like a little onions on it. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Stone-cold E.T.  It's under a million, barely.  Yeah.  The other one is when he says, give me a hell yeah.  And there's that little pause and the lady is about to say something.  And then Stone-cold just goes, oh, hell yeah.  It's so funny.  It really is.  Because I can't believe it hasn't gone like super viral.  And selfishly, I'm surprised the video Opie did with me as Eddie Vedder in the elevator wasn't more.  How many did it get? 
[03:28:30]  It's at like 18,000 now.  I don't want to get to Pro Jam.  I need more people to like tag whatever those Jiffa meant.  You'd think it'd go to at least like 30,000, 40,000.  Yeah.  Even if it doesn't go viral.  You know, it's Jay Moore.  He's doing a good Eddie Vedder.  What do you got up there on the YouTube, Sam?  Are you kidding me?  I'm killing it.  Did you hear about my YouTube success?  No, that's what I'm asking.  5.2 million hits on one video.  What?  Yeah.  How did you not hear about this?  Is this the wrestler with the bad breath?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What was that? 
[03:29:00]  That was AJ from WWE.  That's like 20,000.  This.  A mere bag of shells.  For me.  It's waiting for an iPhone for no reason.  It's a lady and she was waiting online for the iPhone.  I went down and just interviewed people on the iPhone line.  And this lady, she had something wrong with her.  I don't know what her story was.  Always good for YouTube.  Right.  And I was just talking to her about the iPhone.  She had no idea anything about it.  About nothing.  She just got in a line.  For days, she was waiting on the line.  And this thing.  Did she have money to buy the iPhone? 
[03:29:30]  She said she was going to put it on a credit card.  She was good.  Because even if it's a little more expensive than she thought, it's all on a credit card.  So no problem.  Well, you know, Rerun had that problem on what's happening when he tries everything up on his credit cards and went bananas.  Remember?  No.  I didn't watch what's happening.  I'm 29 years old.  Yeah.  Rerun had a whole bunch of credit cards.  He just bought like a stereo and a TV and like, this is great, Rog.  He didn't think about the repercussions.  And all of a sudden, the bill came and he's in like credible debt.  Crushing debt.  See, look.  The story of the community.  Look.  5.2 million views.  Waiting for an iPhone for no reason. 
[03:30:00]  And it's short.  3.31.  That's the other thing.  If you're going to post like a funny thing, don't give me an 11-minute thing.  And it's topical.  Everybody wants a new version of iPhone 5.  Your video, by the way.  The Pearl Jam video.  The Pearl Jam one.  There's a Pearl Jam fan Twitter that has like 20,000 followers that tweeted it yesterday.  They did?  Yeah.  I think I retweeted it, taking a stop.  Looking at my tweets.  Look at this, girl.  I hit 200,000 this week being on this show. 
[03:30:30]  On Twitter?  Yeah.  I'm nowhere near that.  She's like a, what, Polish descent?  Now, something Eastern European, very white, though.  Yeah, very white.  Or what are you planning on using it for?  Rachel.  Texting messages to my friends.  Well, it's good to get an iPhone, then.  She's mentally disabled.  I don't know.  What are the features?  No, I know.  About the new life.  Well, you know.  I don't know.  It's in the family.  So I know when I see her.  I'm not sure because I haven't seen it yet.  She's a star now.  You have 5 million people laughing at a special person. 
[03:31:00]  Well, not all of them laughed.  A lot of them thought I was a bully.  My aunt Christy goes to karaoke every Friday.  She's special.  And every Saturday.  And her boyfriend Ashley goes.  And he's like the star.  It's like special person karaoke at this bowling alley in the valley.  Uh-huh.  So it's amazing.  This should be a documentary about it.  Why don't you?  That's what the shit you got to film.  Yeah, but it's weird.  Like, hey, let me film your son singing fucking teddy bear.  I swear I'm not trying to exploit him. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, you'd have to do it.  It could be a really great, heartfelt documentary.  That sound like it is better.  A little bit.  Some guy.  Oh, really?  And so Ashley, her boyfriend, one day, one night, we're all there.  And he did tequila.  Mm-hmm.  Think about that for a second.  He's dressed as Elvis.  He's got the full wig and the outfit.  What was the outfit?  What was it?  Elvis.  Like Vegas, like fat blob Elvis.  It was like white with the eagles and everything on it?  Yeah, and he has like a guitar and he like shakes around. 
[03:32:00]  Usually he does like, you know, teddy bear or like love me tender.  And he had the wig and the glasses?  He does it every week.  Like, I'm all shook up.  Hey, hey, hey.  And he like flops around.  And his mom is sort of special.  And she...  How old is he?  40.  In his 40s?  Okay.  Christy's 50.  Okay.  And so his mom will do a song and she'll always dedicate it to my wife's mom, my mother-in-law.  But they bring the mic to her.  So my uncle Dan goes, oh, Christ, Carol and her cherry-okey. 
[03:32:30]  Because she never gets up.  She doesn't.  She does cherry-okey.  Right.  But think about doing fucking tequila.  Do you have like...  You just stand there perfectly still.  He didn't dance at all?  No, he just stood...  He's got to wait for that.  You know, he's got to hit the posts.  That's true.  Tequila.  Did it.  Did it.  And then just wait another minute and a half.  Was he being like funny or did he just like...  Yeah, Sam.  He's got an uncanny fucking wit.  Well, he's got...  There's one lyric in the song.  He's got...  You got to see this guy stand up too.  And you know when he writes for The New Yorker? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  He's got great allegories that he writes.  And really, he's the one that wrote the book how Peanuts is an allegorical story at all times.  Do people just look around at each other like...  It's a special person.  Yeah, but you're there.  So you just like what?  Like looking around like...  Who can I experience this with?  Uncle Dan and my wife.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Uncle Dan's been on the podcast.  He has?  Oh, yeah.  Uncle Dan is hilarious.  Yeah?  Uncle Dan is really good.  Huh?  Uncle Dan is really good. 
[03:33:30]  Uncle Dan's had every job.  He's done almost every job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a good podcast.  Him and Ryan Sickler were on.  So you're like the Jimmy Kimmel podcast.  You're just bringing your whole family on and then bringing the celebrities on and...  You know what it really was?  Was I wanted to prove...  Like Johnny Carson would have like a lady with a potato chip collection and make her like  a star.  Right.  I wanted to see if I could bring like a civilian and still do an interesting podcast.  Did it work?  Yeah.  Everyone was like, people are like, bring back Uncle Dan and...  Eric loved it. 
[03:34:00]  I didn't get to hear it.  It's been on twice now, I think, right?  Yeah, it was on with Ray Mancini and I said, I was talking to Ray Mancini when he killed  Kim Dukku, Dukku Kim in the ring and he goes, this guy just kept coming at me like a zombie  and Uncle Dan goes, oh man, hope you can try to eat your brains.  That's the most fucking heartfelt, like I murdered a man in the ring story and Uncle Dan goes...  And then Ray Mancini only referred to him as...  You know, you're right, Uncle Dan.  Like only referred to him as Uncle Dan. 
[03:34:30]  And Uncle Dan's making bad zombie jokes.  There's no such thing as a bad zombie joke.  What are you talking about?  By the way, you saved me Tuesday because when I was doing Colin and everybody like kind  of tapped out for some reason.  Well, I was...  You were behind me just giggling your balls off.  Because I thought the whole thing was hilarious.  I thought it was...  Spot on Colin Quinn as always.  I thought a lot...  And I got your back too.  When you said...  When they were talking about some place in New York water and they called it Devil's Gate  and Colin spoke up and just said it should be called Watergate. 
[03:35:00]  It's called Watergate because it's in the water.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, that made me giggle from the couch.  But it was you doing the impression.  It was the absurd jokes that Colin was making.  But you got to be smart.  Yeah, I know.  Because Colin's an erudite.  But it was also just...  You got to pull references that are actually like just out of everybody else's read.  Like, I voted for John Anderson.  It was such an intrusion on the conversation that was happening.  Like, it was just...  It was such an interruption.  And Ant and Jim and all... 
[03:35:30]  They were trying to talk about the election and everything.  And they were just acting...  They were just...  You were on the pain-o-mind list.  In my mind, I thought they've had an hour...  They've had two hours of nothing but screaming this.  Uh-huh.  So I thought...  Well, you know...  If I...  If I...  I always think like if I was...  And believe me, I know how annoying I am.  I'm not...  I'm not like, uh...  Bananas.  Uh-huh.  I'm well aware of the fact that I talk entirely too much.  At times.  No.  Even like when Billy was here.  Billy would just start...  Billy would just start talking to me.  Not realizing there was a mic in front of him. 
[03:36:00]  And you were too polite to be like,  Billy, we'll have this conversation another time.  They had to...  Like, multiple times people had to be like,  Look, guys.  Like, Jim had to be like,  There's two conversations happening at once here.  Yeah, I hope he said there's too much stuff going on.  Yeah.  I hope he's not upset with me.  I don't think he's upset with you.  That's my buddy, man.  That's my main dude.  He keeps inviting you back.  He's not going to be upset with you.  Well, tomorrow I'm going to tap myself out.  You're not coming in tomorrow?  Well, if it's Rich and Bonnie and Roger Moore and Brian Regan,  like, I mean...  Why don't you just come in?  Like, that's the other thing.  Like, you could also come and then leave. 
[03:36:30]  Like, you could come in when Rich and Bonnie are here,  because that would probably be funny.  Yeah.  And then once Roger Moore gets here...  Yeah, I'll leave for that.  What time is Rich and Bonnie?  Wrong.  What time are Rich and Bonnie?  I think they're like seven.  So Rich and Bonnie will be here at seven.  You can easily hang with that.  Because here's the thing.  I never want to be the guy, when you walk in, that go,  oh, fuck.  He's a friend of the show.  Like, we can't turn him away.  Yeah.  Because I'm so...  It's so incestuous at this point.  Like, it would be...  It would be weird. 
[03:37:00]  So...  You couldn't just go, not today, killer.  Yeah.  Like, you gotta be polite.  Opie actually would text me and say, tomorrow's not good.  He would.  Yeah, he would.  I would think he would.  I would hope so.  But so, what was your thinking then yesterday, when you were like,  so I've heard there's been two hours of shouting.  Let's just have ridiculous comedy that makes no sense,  because it's been so point-driven.  But this is my point of view about this election.  This is the counterpoint of view about this election.  Here's, again, my point of view.  No one's coming off of the point of the caller either agrees or disagrees. 
[03:37:30]  Because, you know, they should call it Watergate.  Made me laugh.  Kennesaw Mountain Landis was the commissioner of baseball  by the time Louie got that boat back.  The other thing I liked was that...  A boring ball.  You wouldn't just try.  Like, it wasn't like, oh, I'm going to try this  and see if they want to go in a different direction.  And then if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.  You were like, no.  We're going in another direction.  And they were like, no, Jay.  We're really not doing that right now.  Battle of wills.  Yeah.  Battle of the network stores,  except no one in the room was on a network.  And then, while all this is happening, 
[03:38:00]  like, there's a show happening.  Jay leans over to me and he goes,  hey, can you get Colin on the phone?  Here's the inside that you didn't get yet.  Because you and I have never hung out.  And by the way, Delightful, I love your show.  When I was up in Cold Lake, Alberta,  in Edmonton, Alberta,  when their show was over, I was listening to you.  And I loved it.  Thank you very much.  I loved it.  Thank you.  There's your drop.  Make sure you isolate that, Eric.  I need every bit of credibility I can get at this point. 
[03:38:30]  I was all...  All right, ready?  I was in the middle of nowhere, Canada, on the road,  depressed, bummed out,  away from my wife and my boys for, like, the first time.  And I was listening to your show, Sam Roberts.  And I got to tell you,  you brought me a little closer to home.  I loved it.  Thank you, my man.  See, and you could have easily been like...  Don't talk over the drop, Sam!  No, I thought you were done.  We have my six isolated.  We're good.  You got enough room there?  Yeah.  Because you could have been depressed.  You were depressed anyway, so it was like...  No, I'm never depressed, really.  You just said you were depressed  because you were away from your family.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you meant if I was depressed  and suffering from depression.  No, I meant you're sad  because you're away from your family. 
[03:39:00]  You could turn this show on  and be like,  and now this fucking guy has a show.  But you listen to the show  and it actually made you feel better.  No, it's like what we said yesterday with Louis.  Like, we all...  It's a group.  This is what I like.  And you know this from listening to the podcast.  I really pride myself on the positivity  because a lot of other podcasts that I won't name  are just negative, mudslinging, fucking cunts.  Like, they just really...  Is it a weird...  Like, is it a competitive podcast world?  Not really.  Not for me.  I mean, there's pie for everyone.  There's more pie than you think exists. 
[03:39:30]  Like, here you are with your own show.  Yeah.  You just keep carving pieces out of the pie.  There's enough for everybody.  Right.  And the thing about podcasting especially  is like it's literally...  It's not like it's serious  and there's a limited number of channels or shows.  It's like it's literally...  If you have the internet, you can...  It's the human race.  ...do a show.  The human race is your new pie.  Mm-hmm.  So what you didn't know that would happen yesterday  when I was doing Colin, doing Colin, doing Colin  and I could sense them getting annoyed  is I went to text...  You were sitting right next to me.  I didn't want to talk  because it would be too obvious. 
[03:40:00]  I took out my phone and I went to text you.  Do me a favor and call Colin.  There's a little problem.  Sam Roberts is not on my phone.  I'm so tired and bleary-eyed  with my goddamn toupee on crooked.  I'm scrolling through my...  I'm like, Sam Sheridan.  Sam, where the fuck is he?  I'm like, you don't have him.  And I go, oh my God, I don't have him.  Hey, will you call Colin?  Yeah, and so he just takes his headphones off  and goes, come here, Sam.  Get Colin on the phone.  It's like, this will solve everything.  They're not going with Colin right now. 
[03:40:30]  If I can get Colin on the phone,  what we need is more Colin Quinn.  It seems to be a 90-10 split positive on Twitter  which for when I was doing better  and then Colin...  Because it's like, that's the other thing  is do you chase better from Tuesday?  Yeah, it's tough.  Because what happens is  if you chase it and people get sick of it,  Tuesday's ruined.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like then people, if you don't...  Just let it be a standalone like madness.  Right, we'll replay it on the weekend  and it'll be one of those bits that just stays 
[03:41:00]  and you can always throw it on.  And what it made me do is when I went home,  I thought, I know other things I can do  that I don't know I can do yet.  Like, because then I did better an entire day.  I did Colin an entire day.  You're working on the Sam Roberts.  Norm's too loud to do well.  You can't all day go,  Hey, that's what Jimmy just brought up prostitution.  Well, you probably could,  but it wouldn't be a good idea.  It'd be bad.  It'd be bad, bad, bad, bad radio.  So it's a 90-10 swing, which is good. 
[03:41:30]  In the past, it was probably 50-50 of shut up.  But I think also doing a podcast,  I've learned to actually let the other person talk,  which is, sadly, at 42 years old,  a brand new skill set for me.  Well, that's the first thing that Obi brought up  about your podcast,  and I definitely recognize.  Like, it's a different Jay Moore on a podcast  than we were used to seeing on the show.  Like, it's not sort of all over the place,  A-D-D, Jay Moore.  It's like, you know, we're talking  and we're focused on one thing.  Yeah, and it's sad when you realize at 42 
[03:42:00]  how annoying you must have been for 20-plus years.  I'm being completely serious and honest.  Yeah.  To realize, like, you come in and smother everybody,  because I've always hit for average,  not really power.  Like, I just swing, swing, swing.  Joke, joke, joke.  But there's enough home runs in there  that they invite you back.  That is true, but at the same time,  you are running, like, a couple...  I stepped on a couple lines today  where I was like, fuck.  Uh-huh.  But at least I know...  What do you need to tell me?  But isn't doing your podcast 
[03:42:30]  like when you fill in for Jim Rome,  isn't it the same thing?  Hold on.  Oh, that's why you guys wear headphones.  You can have the inter-talk.  So we can hear E-Rock.  Hold on, let me text E-Rock.  E-Rock, oh, sorry.  I don't have your number.  E-Rock what?  I was saying, isn't doing your podcast  sort of like when you're filling in for Jim Rome?  Isn't it the same concept  where you're just listening to what's going on?  No, because Jim Rome's a monologue when I do it.  I have to provide three hours of content solo  and then people chime in with calls once in a while.  I provide three hours of content.  Like if you have your own... 
[03:43:00]  Say if I wanted to have my own sports radio show,  you have to show up with three hours of content  and you've got to hope you have something  where people jump on board  and start calling something.  Right.  One time I hosted Jim Rome  and on the ticker  when they put the guy's injury in parentheses,  it said Joey Porter, linebacker for the Steelers,  it said Joey Porter out, parentheses, gunshot.  And I went, what?  And I said it on the air  and then the email started coming in  and we set an email record.  It was 3,000 emails in an hour came in. 
[03:43:30]  It was like, dear JJ, JFK Jr. out, parentheses, ocean.  Ray Coombs out, parentheses, noose.  It was amazing.  That's the same...  Like I do the show on Sunday just alone.  And you're right.  It's a totally different like animal.  You have to literally prepare  for the possibility of nobody jumping on board.  Like you have to have...  Kevin Smith taught me...  He taught me...  He said the two most important things about a podcast.  First of all, he said it's a goddamn high school schoolyard 
[03:44:00]  and if you just get that in your head going in.  And I was like, how is that possible?  And then a year and a half in, I'm like, wow.  Meaning what?  There's cliques.  Right, okay.  And you know what I'm lucky about?  Is my clique, my jocks hooked up with fucking Corolla's greasers  and like Ace and Fake Mustache Studios were like homies.  So is that what happened real quick?  Like you were good with Corolla's people  and then that's what took off?  And like Corolla and I have always been real easy.  Like it's just this dialogue that never really stops. 
[03:44:30]  You see a guy a year later  and you just get right back into it and fun and great.  And there's other guys and other podcasts  where they're like there's their crew and squad and their thing  and you're just like, hmm.  It's really, it's kind of like a personality divide, I guess.  That's interesting.  And then he also said content is king.  You have to be able to, like if you're going to do a podcast,  if you're Sam Roberts going to do a show every Sunday,  like you just said, you better make sure no phones, no computers.  How long is your show?  It's two hours.  Two hours of just you talking. 
[03:45:00]  Is that going to make people crash their cars into walls  or are they going to be happy?  Right.  And it's not like you can just show up and be like,  well, I'm Sam.  I just get in front of a mic  and everybody's just going to love whatever I have to say.  No, just go through the post, read the headlines.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I talk about everything.  It's all good.  It's all good.  And the other one he said is it's got to come out  the exact same time every week  or people lose their shit.  And I've had one, like if it's four hours late,  people are like, where is it?  And I drive a fucking truck and I need it. 
[03:45:30]  And you're like, well, it's coming out.  It'll be up.  Sorry, but it'll be up at one in the afternoon.  It's like, fuck you.  I'm done driving my truck by 9 a.m.  I started throwing a podcast out there.  Maybe that's why it's gaining no traction  because I just throw it up.  Like sometimes it's on Tuesdays, but sometimes it's not.  Got to be the same time.  Sometimes I skip a week.  Sometimes I don't.  That's the number one rule of bad.  I've seen Twitter go nuts for Jay's podcast not being out.  No timely.  Maybe Jay has something going on.  Also, Bill Burr's.  If he's traveling or he puts it out.  Bill does it all himself, too.  Yeah, and they start.  You just see Twitter flooding. 
[03:46:00]  Why isn't it up here?  And he's like, it's going to be up in two hours.  I just finished recording it.  It's going to be up in two hours.  I got to talk about.  What's wrong with you people?  I got to talk about Steven Singer.  I don't want you to go.  I have to go, actually.  Why?  Because I need to go to sleep.  I'm recording two podcasts today.  What do you have?  Brian Koppelman.  Screen wrote Rounders and just wrote Runner Runner with Ben Affleck.  Old friend.  And Andy Cohen.  Bravo, Andy.  That's going to be a big one.  Yeah, well, you know, he's a tough get.  He's tough to pin down.  So we have a time planned. 
[03:46:30]  And I'm just hoping a chipmunk doesn't fart in the woods and spook him.  Yeah.  That's going to be good.  Like, well, I can't make it.  Brian Koppelman.  Is that his sister that works here?  I have no idea.  But he.  Jenny.  Oh, yeah.  Jenny Hutt.  That's his sister, I think.  Yeah, that's his sister.  I don't know is my answer still, no matter what you say.  Well, listen, if you ask any woman what the best gift they ever got was, without hesitation, and this is true, without even thinking about it, she'll say her engagement ring.  Oh, yeah.  Every time.  Every time they say that.  The one thing, Jay, that I did right. 
[03:47:00]  The ones that aren't engaged say it.  Right, of course.  Yeah, that's the gift they're looking forward to, most of all.  The one thing that I did right, besides marry my wife, is I got her a great engagement ring.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she washes her hands.  Every time someone at the store hands her change, you get credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day.  So it's got to be perfect.  And Steven Singer gets that.  At Steven Singer Jewelers, they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.

[03:48:00]  Now, Jay Moore.  Yes, sir.  You know who Josh Peck is, the actor?  I do not.  He was on Drake and Josh.  Oh, those precious kids.  Yeah, Josh Peck is coming in here.  The Wackness was good.  That was Ben Kingsley?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When he runs...  Spoiler alert.  Well, it came out like three years ago.  He just, at the end, decides to kill himself.  He just goes into the ocean and keeps going?  Right.  I thought it was incredible.  But he's a star.  Josh Peck is a kid in that movie.  But he's not on Drake and Josh.  That's Drake and Josh from Josh from Drake and Josh.  By the way, could you pick two words that are more fucking impossible to say in your house? 
[03:48:30]  You go, what are you watching?  Jake and Drash?  Drash and Drash?  It's impossible.  And that's the show that taught my kids to act like cunts.  Is it?  They're the most precocious fucking asshole.  All Nick Jr. shows.  The kids are all like, oh, okay, Dad.  So you should stay in here.  Stay in here, then.  I gotta go, Sam.  Stay in here for Josh Peck.  It's gonna be like, stay for 20 minutes.  It'll be fine.  Sam, how about this?  How about I take your picture right now?  Okay.  And I put it up on the twit.  Okay.  Get your face away from the mic. 
[03:49:00]  Well, I gotta talk.  One of us has to keep talking.  And you give me your Twitter handle.  It's not Sam.  You follow me.  I do, don't I?  You started following me the other day.  I said, what's this about?  Because you've proven yourself, young Skywalker.  It's positivity, man.  Hashtag that shit.  Isolate that, too.  Let's get Josh Peck in here.  You stay in here, Johnny.  It's gonna be fine.  It was...  All right.  Josh, tell Josh to come in.  You made him wait?  He's just doing the rounds and stuff right now.  He's walking in right now.  If I'm gonna put this out, you have to tweet more. 
[03:49:30]  Because the other guys, like DeRosa doesn't tweet.  You go, hey, follow my friend.  And then they don't tweet.  And people are like, why do they follow this clown?  So what if he's at levity?  Josh Peck.  Yo.  How's it going, man?  What's up, bro?  Have a seat.  You know Jay Moore?  How are you?  Pleasure to meet you.  He's a big-time comedian.  He's on all kinds of television shows.  Big-time comedian.  Yeah.  He's his wrench.  There you go.  Grab this.  We're on the air right now, so make yourself comfortable.  Exciting.  You know, Josh, we were just talking about you before you came in. 
[03:50:00]  Are you on Twitter, Josh?  I am on Twitter.  All right.  Then let me...  I should redo this so we can do a group one.  Oh, that's gonna be great.  It's a lot of pressure, Twitter.  You think so?  I think so, right?  A little bit?  140 characters trying to be funny?  It does make you an expert at the edit.  Like, I have turns into I've.  You've become a master of contractions immediately.  Do you...  Absolutely.  You always got stuff going on.  You, Jay, always have stuff to promote.  Oh, I always have stuff going on.  Right.  There's always something happening.  We're pretty big deals. 
[03:50:30]  Do you sit there trying to...  Big-time actor.  Trying to...  Wagness?  Yeah.  Ben Kingsley, he worked with fucking Gandhi.  I'm aware.  You know, Gandhi went on a hunger strike.  Thanks, Colin.  Are you aware of what, like, do you try to stop yourself from promoting on Twitter?  Like, you're like, okay, I've promoted enough stuff.  I've promoted enough.  I need to get something creative out there on Twitter.  Like, I need to keep the people.  I'm pretty good on the self-promotion tip.  Like, I don't go too hard.  I actually probably could do it a little bit more.  It's just mostly, like, random thoughts that come out of my head.  But you don't really self-promote. 
[03:51:00]  It's tempting, bro.  Like, once I put the link up to a trailer I was in, and I just felt like a jerk-off.  What's your Twitter address, Josh?  I'm the at Portable Shua.  Worst Twitter name in the history of the world.  Because some jerk took my name.  A website to buy Gucci's?  Yes.  At?  At.  E-T?  At?  No, like at.  Oh, at.  Where are you from?  Welcome to Twitter.  At.  Where are you from?  I'm from New York.  You're in New York.  You're very New York.  At Portable.  I get it. 
[03:51:30]  Shua, as in, short for Joshua.  You're a brilliant man.  Thank you.  S-H-U-A?  Thank you.  S-H-U-A.  S-U-A.  I just said it short for Joshua.  Just like that?  Beautiful.  All right.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  Just because you gave me shit, you get second billing on that tweet, pal.  What?  Uh-oh.  You got it.  Bull.  That's bullshit.  Bull.  That's what's going on right now.  I don't want any backtalk in this locker room.  Josh, you're running the point.  Sam, grab some pine.  I'll get to you in the second quarter if he gets a foul trouble.  I was just talking to Jay because Jay knows Drake and Josh. 
[03:52:00]  Okay.  And he knows the wackness.  And he's in, like, I thought it was so interesting because I knew, I saw the wackness and loved it.  Oh, thank you very much.  I had no idea you were Josh from Drake and Josh.  That's a whole other world.  Yeah.  Like, it doesn't even – and Jay, who's just sitting here saying, I love the wackness, he knows Drake and Josh because he has kids.  Right.  He had no idea just before you came in here that you're the same guy.  We're the same people.  Yeah.  But I also said derogatory things about the entire Nick Jr. channel just taught both of my sons how to act like cunts. 
[03:52:30]  Why?  Because everyone's pre-teen going like, whatever, Dad.  Right.  That's tough.  Yeah.  I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.  You know what?  I don't want to hear that shit in my house on a goddamn cruise ship.  Sweet life on deck.  That shit might fly.  When you get to fuck it.  Kim Possible.  It's hilarious.  You can be snarky at sea.  Yeah.  Very well.  Very well.  Very well done, sir. 
[03:53:00]  It is a lot of back-talking to parents where the humor is like, how do I get out of my cabin on this ship and have, oh, I broke the goddamn baby grand piano.  I'm a nanny.  And here, look, there's an Indian child now suddenly in front of me.  Yeah.  If you keep treating me like a douchebag, you're not getting your Xbox games, so who wins?  Right.  That's right.  Right.  So you've got the power.  Now, I definitely have the power.  Definitely.  But it's a benevolent dictatorship.  It's certainly not, there's not, I don't even have to go that far to barter.  Really?  I got very good guys. 
[03:53:30]  But my baby, 18-month-old, he's not anything on the TV he's into, but he's going to be a problem.  Why do you say that?  Because he's all, he's.  You know at 18 months?  He's a tank, and he likes to climb.  It's like owning a monkey.  Really?  Where, like, my older boy would just kind of hang out and be still, like, with a car, you know, and he just, you could just leave him, go outside and smoke.  Fire up a heater.  Light up a palm oil and just hope for the best.  Were you worried, though?  18-month-old is just, if it's there.  Like, I got to constantly go, get away from the steps, get away, no, no, no, get down, get down, get down. 
[03:54:00]  And then I realized, I think it was a tweet I sent, I was feeling very Eastern, and I was like, I tell you my son to get off the stairs.  How do you deny man's need to climb?  How do you, how do your Twitter, what's your Twitter responders like?  Because, like, if I sent something like that out, they'd be like, fuck you.  Block everybody.  Yeah.  I've blocked 3,000 people.  If you tell me, that really wasn't that funny.  Well, you know what?  This is really that blocked.  There's so much power in the block. 
[03:54:30]  Yes.  You block a lot of people.  Josh knows this, because you probably got crazy people up your ass about it, too.  Yeah, people are mean.  And what you do is, you just make Twitter a tower, a crystal delicate tower of positivity only.  Yeah.  And if anyone says anything like, fuck you, block, block.  Done.  But you gotta let it go out.  Like, I got pictures of a bus, the block bus.  I got a blockadile.  Somebody sent me a blockadile.  It was just a bird going, ah, you're blocked.  I just ignore them.  I had Mike Tirico from NFL Network going, blocked, blocked. 
[03:55:00]  I had, like, audio clips.  I go, you'll enjoy this.  And they go, and they listen to it.  It's like a fucking grenade dressed up in a package.  I just ignore them because I don't want my numbers to go down at all.  That's fair, too.  You want your, no, you want your, you want your P1s, Sam.  You're right.  It's all about the P1s.  It's all about your audience.  I don't need the people on the side that are fringe people.  They're just following me to insult me.  People I've got into battles with, like radio people and other podcasting people.  And it's like, you should go on that podcast or you should go on that radio show. 
[03:55:30]  And then I think to myself, why?  To win all the people that said I was a dick back?  Like, I don't want, I'm going to win them back over?  No.  Like, that's okay.  Yeah, do you do Twitter battles, like, against people?  I used to, and I realized I had a dream once that when I died, I went to heaven and God  said, I need to talk to you about two years of your life.  And I went, oh, no.  It was a vivid, vivid, vivid dream.  You were like, I cannot commit this much time.  I was like, oh, my God.  God wants to see me.  Like, what did I do?  Like, two years of sin.  I'm a big Catholic, so I'm spooked out, right? 
[03:56:00]  Right, it happens.  It was the two years combined is the amount of time I spent arguing with strangers on the  internet.  And he looked at me like, what are you doing?  That happened in your dream?  God came to you and said, stop arguing with you.  I had died.  No, I went to him.  I died.  It was a home game for him.  And you were like.  So do you, you can't get into Twitter fights, I'm assuming.  You're too much of a public.  I got to be careful.  Like, I complimented Justin Bieber and got 5,000 tweets out of it.  So I'm a fucking believer.  Like, the man has so much palliator. 
[03:56:30]  You swear freaks me out.  Yeah.  Because you're a Nick Jr. guy.  Well, you didn't really.  He sweared all over.  No, I'm straight Nickelodeon.  I'm not Nick Jr.  So Nickelodeon, we go a little crazy.  I bet.  I bet.  I bet.  I fucking slimed and shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Were you worried doing the wackness?  Because you're playing a pot dealer.  You're talking about getting laid.  You're cursing.  You're doing all this stuff.  Like, were you worried about, okay, this is totally outside my audience.  There are families that love me, and they're not going to love me doing this.  I mean, it was, I guess it was a fear that there would be some people that would be totally 
[03:57:00]  resistant to it.  But also, like, the show's been on for like 10 years, and I'm 26 now.  And so a lot of the fans, like, are in their early 20s, late teens, and I feel like the  wackness is right in their wheelhouse.  Like, they're ready to move on with you.  Yeah.  Like, maybe they could actually, because as I got older, I wanted to do more, like, indie,  gritty stuff.  And hopefully, their kind of taste matured.  But, you know, I'm sure there's a couple parents in the Midwest that are angry at me.  And for that, I'm sort of sorry.  Not really. 
[03:57:30]  Not really.  But for the sake of Twitter followers, you're sorry.  Oh, absolutely.  I try to have, like, a really respectable Twitter record.  Well, the movie you're in now is Red Dawn.  Red Dawn.  And this is, like, a giant action movie.  You're in Red Dawn?  Yes.  Oh, I hate you.  Why?  I can't help it.  Because it's the greatest gig you could ever get.  Warriors.  And he's sitting there.  Wolverines.  Whatever.  Oh, come on.  And you get to co-star with Thor.  With Chris Hemsworth.  Yeah.  I don't care about him.  A beautiful hunk of man.  Yeah.  I just enjoy looking at him all day on this side. 
[03:58:00]  Did somebody get that cool Swayze?  The shit that he's called into the woods to get each other's attention?  Did you watch the original?  No, I didn't watch the original until after we shot the movie.  All right.  That's probably smart.  You know, I just knew that there would be stuff in it that, I mean, I'm playing Charlie Sheen's  character from the original.  So, I knew there would be stuff that he did that I was just like.  I'm winning over here, I'm winning over there.  Tiger blood.  So, I just knew that I would fall in love with some of this stuff.  Yeah.  So, I figured I would take a fresh approach and then I watched it like the day we finished.  The trailer is stressful because the trailer is literally like you wait because the CGI 
[03:58:30]  that you could do now, the movie looks ridiculous because it's like it starts with guys just  waking up and the world is completely gone to shit.  There's just bombs going off in front of their houses.  Right.  I mean, the scope of the movie is what's cool about it is like pays homage to the original  and I think people are going to get like blasted with nostalgia every 10 minutes from like the  spider trap scene.  Like there's a lot of stuff in the first movie, but you know, we can do so much more 30 years  later. 
[03:59:00]  Are you fighting somebody else now?  It's North Korea.  I'm just going to ask.  North Koreans?  North Koreans.  Is it a small town?  Is it the same town?  It's a small town.  Yeah.  It'd be weird if you changed it like, nah bro, it's fucking Miami.  Shit got real, bro.  You changed shit up.  You know what I'm saying?  Shit got real, bro.  North Koreans are like, we can make it.  That's just how I realized I was about to do a racist impression of it, which I don't  want to do.  No, you don't want to do that at all.  No.  No, not at all.  No, I'm looking for that fucking corporate gig.  Yeah, I don't worry. 
[03:59:30]  Portable Shua on Twitter.  Jimmy Superfly Shua Snooker.  I'm going to split and let you two talk because you're a very good interviewer.  We got a minute left in the show.  Well, without me.  Jay, come on, bro.  Retweet that shit, bro.  I will.  I'll do it right now.  I got a little.  Remember Jack Tripper used to go.  I got a red hat at the Regal Beagle waiting for me.  No, he's 26 and I'm 29.  We don't remember what Jack Tripper used to say.  I got a red hat in the hotel room waiting for me.  You mean a ginger?  I mean my wife.  I'm going to go.  Maybe she's sleeping on her stomach.  Good times.  You know?  I'm not like looking at the girls guy. 
[04:00:00]  What do I care?  Just talk to him.  He's a fucking promoting a movie.  He did a good times quote earlier.  Thanks.  And I'm going, no, I don't know good times.  I'm like, I'm not there.  I'm not having a good time listening to your random quotes that I don't know.  Old man.  We do have to go.  Yo, this hurts.  But I know.  Thank you for having me.  Thank you for being here.  You can stop by.  Jay Moore, super cool guy.  Jay Moore, Josh Peck.  The movie's Red Dawn.  It's out November 21st.  Is that correct?  Yes.  November 21st.  That's my brother's birthday. 
[04:00:30]  Happy birthday, brother.  It's all up here.  You saw I didn't read anything when I plugged the movie just now.  You really was up there.  Hold on.  Nothing.  You got nothing.  Nothing.  Like you said, I'm a genius.  Oh, my God.  Portable Shua on Twitter.  Yes.  November 21st, Red Dawn in theaters.  Does it get any better than this?  A double plug?  Twitter and movie?  Speaking of plugs, let me do this real quick.  Okay.  Josh, and this is great because Stephen Singer will be glad that Josh Peck is here.  Stephen Singer?  Yeah.  I don't know if you know Stephen Singer.  Stephen Singer.  It's almost as hard to say as Drake and Josh. 
[04:01:00]  Stephen Singer.  Yes.  If you ask any woman what the best gift she ever got was, what do you think she would  say, Josh Peck?  Something from Stephen Singer.  An engagement ring, of course.  An engagement ring.  Yeah.  Have you ever given a girl an engagement ring?  Don't even put that into the atmosphere.  No.  The idea of me having to wed someone.  It's not there at all.  It's not, no, not soon.  Well, listen, Stephen Singer, I gave an engagement ring to a girl.  You did?  Her name was Jess.  Congrats.  And aside from picking Jess, it was the greatest thing I ever could have done.  Really? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because every time she shows anybody that engagement ring, I get credit for it.  How many carrots are we talking about?  Not a lot of carrots.  I don't get paid a lot of money to do that.  This isn't like a Hollywood set.  This is radio.  It's a totally, it's technically show business, but it's not really show business.  It's like half.  It's half.  It's kind of show business.  Yeah.  Like you get to talk to an audience.  Right.  But they don't really pay you a lot of money for it.  But even with not a lot of money, I could go down to Stephen Singer and get hooked up.  He's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philly.  Right.  IHateStevenSinger.com and 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER for all your diamond needs. 
[04:02:00]  More importantly than that, though, is Red Dawn, November 21st.  Josh Peck, thank you for being here.  Thank you.  You're welcome back anytime.  I'm going to buy you like a Stephen Singer pendant.  I can't wait for that.  That's Stephen Singer's Star of David.  That sounds perfect.  You're welcome.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  I was listening to your show, Sam Roberts, and I've got to tell you, you brought me a little  closer to home.  I loved it.  Thank you, my man.
