<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with crude jokes about the show itself, followed by a discussion of one host's lost iPhone, prompting reminiscing about life before readily available cell phones and the memorization of phone numbers. This led to vulgar jokes about phone number recycling after death. The conversation then shifted to a negative and offensive commentary on the UN's presence in New York City, specifically targeting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit.  A caller, Akiva, discussed Jewish holidays, Sukkot and the lulav, sparking a lengthy, often offensive, conversation about Jewish culture and traditions.  A prolonged, vulgar bit ensued, featuring various radio advertisement impressions revolving around the phrase "dick inside."  The segment concluded with a discussion of a *Dance with the Stars* appearance and speculation about the contestant's personal life, along with comments on professional wrestling, including an incident involving wrestler China.

The show continued with a discussion about Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino from *Jersey Shore* and his appearance on *Dancing with the Stars*. This transitioned into a recounting of a Comic-Con experience, including encounters with David Hasselhoff (arriving by helicopter), William Shatner, and LeVar Burton (who allegedly snubbed them).  A substantial portion of the show focused on highly critical and graphic commentary, using extensive profanity, on episodes of *Hoarders* and *Intervention*.  The hosts described, in graphic detail, unsanitary living conditions and the behavior of individuals featured on both shows, expressing disgust and anger at their attitudes and the show's professionals.

The "Hoarders" discussion, sparked by a clip showing a house slated for demolition, continued with callers sharing their own disturbing and shocking experiences with hoarders, often using highly offensive language.  Callers described homes filled with human and animal waste and dead animals. One caller detailed a house infested with wasps that had to be burned down, while another recounted finding tens of thousands of dollars in a deceased relative's house.  The conversation then shifted to celebrity birthdays (Bill Murray, Stephen King) and Michael Douglas's health. A heated argument between two callers, filled with homophobic slurs and insults, erupted after a discussion of a video of Leonard Cohen collapsing onstage.  The segment concluded with an interview with Judah Freelancer (presumably a misspelling of Judah Friedlander), author of "How to Beat Up Anybody," who discussed the book's content and his experiences in comedy.

The Judah Friedlander interview continued with anecdotes from a muddy music festival, including graphic descriptions of various indecent acts.  This led to a quiz from Friedlander's karate book, involving analyzing a photo of him in a messy room, prompting discussion of his past squalid living conditions in New York City.  Friedlander detailed his career progression, from struggling early years to success in television and film (*Meet the Parents*), including anecdotes about unpaid gigs at comedy clubs and interactions with other comedians.  He promoted his book and upcoming appearances, mentioning encounters with several celebrities (Tim Conway, Carrie Fisher, Bill Cosby).  The interview concluded with Friedlander describing inappropriate images in his extensive phone photo collection.

[00:09:30]  your mom or your dad at work you'd have that number i'll just go downstairs and uh you know knock  at his office door you'd have both neighbors phone numbers on either side of you right um these are  just like things as a kid you had to fucking memorize i remember opie's number your 516 number  i can i memorize um and voss's number it's weird like the professional numbers i still remember yeah  yeah i don't know why why would i remember that i don't know maybe because i was gonna call you in  case i was injured now nothing now it's it's gotten to the point you don't remember travis was like he 
[00:10:00]  doesn't even know his own wife's phone number yeah it's like you just reach a point where there's  no need to know numbers they're in an electronic device that's it i got a house phone don't know  the number i think i know two phone numbers i i have two phones and i don't even know the number of  one of the phones i got i i just used uh one of my home phone line now it's just a fax number right  that's just a fax number now and uh i only use my cell phone i'm special 
[00:10:30]  well we all do that chris chris hey go ahead i like numbers numbers in genesee  good numbers good numbers that's it retiring the phone number nice all right have a good day boy  unless uh oh your old area code has been changed so maybe that's maybe it hasn't officially been 
[00:11:00]  retired maybe but i don't want to give the i don't want to give that area code out because  that was my number the one i gave out was definitely yeah and uh for whatever reason  it's no longer in service so because all long island used to have the same area code  and all in new york there were only two like for the city in long island there were two it was  516 for fucking long island 212 for new york city that's it and then they broke it down  the 631 and 516 right and 201 in jersey city is like you know all the boroughs have their own 
[00:11:30]  friggin area code it used to be no matter what borough you call it it was 212 that made it easier  to remember phone numbers because if you're a long island guy like we were you mostly had long island  numbers you had to memorize you never you didn't need the first three you never had that dial it  you didn't have to dial the friggin now in your same area code you have to dial the area code you do  now yeah my phone just dials i literally haven't i don't you don't dial that exactly that's just it  like if you want to call your next door neighbor you still have to put in the area code if you dialed 
[00:12:00]  it you'd have to still put in the area code uh but years ago you just you just dialed fucking  seven numbers i remember when 908 came to me to new jersey like that was a big thing they were  splitting 201 and it was 201 and 609 and then they were splitting 908 yeah how many times i've had this  conversation on first dates and lost oh i know and then you just the girls just aren't they  captivated by it they can't stop talking area code they're just fascinated by it especially when i go  and then i remember i would rape a girl in 609 and not have to drive up and wash my uh hands in uh 908 
[00:12:30]  people are calling there's a new area code but like i said that's not my number where yeah because i  would love to call my old number but i mean if they change the area code and stuff that's that's not the  same no that's not the same not the same number so you'll be fine without your iphone yeah yeah i'll be  all right i do have my backup phone i also have a phone in the uh the escalade but again i don't know  people's phone numbers but that's like voice activated you could just go uh call bloody bloody 
[00:13:00]  blah and it tiles bloody bloody blah uh also um getting out of here yesterday a severe pain in the ass  well we got all the world you n fucking united cock nations i hate the u.n you don't like it it  stinks why is it here it's a complete waste of time it shouldn't be in new york city what do they get

[00:15:00]  hits the streets in new york and enjoys a fine new york uh fall day that's a great guy stops at a  starbucks gets a little cup of coffee and walks around a little shopping can i put that request  in i want to follow him for a day well what do you think you would see if you followed someone like  that for a day you'd probably see his security guy beating the fuck out of your head no kidding  if you're following but what do you think a guy like that is doing in new york as he as he has to  tell everyone how much he hates america enjoying he's gotta be fruits of our freedom

[00:27:30]  if you're an orthodox jew uh then you can't then when you have those holidays wow this is awesome  you can't use electricity i'm penciling it in talk about the jews on thursday and friday  isn't that yeah we could do as much jew humor as we want isn't that the day they make the  elevators in the buildings just kind of go up and down and stop on every floor what are you talking  about automatically yeah because the jews can't use the elevator so what happens so they just set the  elevator for jew and and it stops on each shut up when you shut the fuck up it's just babbling 
[00:28:00]  it stops it stops on every floor it stops on every floor regardless building i don't know in this  building but it's it's like it just stops on every floor just in case a jew is on a floor but what is  that accomplishing you're cheating the electricity well you're not using it it's just electricity then  go suffer somewhere let us let us all enjoy the electricity they figured it out they figured that 
[00:28:30]  what other what other gizmos have you figured out like at the around the house so you could get  around that electricity well there's uh there we use stuff like uh electronic timers uh to turn things  on and off oh god like uh like air conditioning and stuff like that so they set these timers before  the the ruling right you can't use electricity and then the timer clicks the non-jew timer clicks  and uh what about the clapper could you use a clapper no you can't use the clapper you're just clapping 
[00:29:00]  all this all this so you have some hope after you die do you really think god's gonna punish you  for fucking flipping the switch instead of just setting the timer right they didn't have electricity  when they wrote that shit how do you know you're not supposed to use it right well because because  uh we base a lot of the things that we do today on some of the original laws the law that covers  electricity is the law that covers uh lighting a fire right it's the same idea building no it's not  it's it's not lighting a fire that's your interpretation that's crazy because that's 
[00:29:30]  crazy pants that's an interpretation of the of the law yeah because it was like and said it was  written before electricity so that anything you guys think of is an interpretation of it right  yeah not everybody has the same interpretation and that's what the problem is with this damn  religion this organized shit and we're talking about all of them organized religion blows i am  talking about all of them i'm not just going after the jewy jews well the difference between us though  and i think the people that you're referring to is that we don't ask anybody else to do what we do 
[00:30:00]  or punish people for not doing what we do we just do what we do and have to be like that's true  you know what i'm saying like we don't we don't proselytize we don't convert people to judaism  and we don't uh we don't do anything sometimes although bnh does make me want to convert if you're  in a bnh photo oh they're as orthodox as you can get god are they terrific and they all know what  they're talking about of course they do i know you're the best i think it's the best store in  the city they love that store organized oh my god you cannot steal from from from uh bnh you can't 
[00:30:30]  steal and you get your your stuff you order it right there at the counter and the friggin conveyor  belts come and bring your shit to you yeah it's amazing go into the telescope section though to see  the creep that works oh really he rules telescope guy oh he rules but every all my camera equipment  and lighting and shit like that all from uh bnh well every every aisle you walk down juice juice  hi i'd like some juice hey here's something charlie in staten island retired nypd you're on with 
[00:31:00]  akiva akiva akiva akiva good morning uh in donald park uh the influential jews they call the cops  they call the cops this precinct they send the cops over turn the lights on turn the lights off  no way they i'm not using the police to turn lights on are you kidding absolutely absolutely  they actually call you guys and say i i need you to turn my lights off 
[00:31:30]  now that's an oversimplification of the truth what it is is is that sometimes in emergency  situations where we need uh where we need heat or we need air conditioning turned on or we need a light  turned on for somebody then we have somebody who isn't jewish do it for all right all right listen  hold on hold on let me start this guy says in an emergency and he was talking about ac you never  have to turn on ac as an emergency and how about and how about this as far as heat goes now you could 
[00:32:00]  take the original interpretation of not using fire and say uh fire was was heat back then they suffered  without it so uh why why don't why do you have to have the heat on uh well well usually in services we  have elderly people who would uh you know who would get sick or would become faint or whatever if they  weren't you know we have to take care of a lot of the different people and what would happen if  they passed away let's really think about it what happens i don't know a lot more free time for the 
[00:32:30]  the young yes but you know uh the thing about it is that we don't do it ourselves but in those situations  uh-oh oh you're oh we're losing his god his jew phone is featuring out right the sucker  oh yeah where's that charlie thanks charlie thanks sir uh what it's a droid x you know but i bought  it and i bought it from a dominican all right we don't care are you done uh yeah i think that's 
[00:33:00]  this guy all right all right all right so we got some jewish holidays to deal with yes  we're rolling holidays yes under bright blue skies  i was doing that i i never do ira but i i for some reason the words jay leno show came up  and it's just the jay leno show and i couldn't stop saying it oh you gotta hear how he says cock 
[00:33:30]  you got that from yesterday travis i know we never played it yesterday but we'll play it for uh he is  the great it's fun to say he rules the greatest jew of all time he fucking fantastic how did the um  how did the african uh american day parade go by the way that was sunday i i saw sam i just  looked at sam there was some reason it was a harlem day parade i figured you uh would probably 
[00:34:00]  know i wasn't there i wanted to go why didn't you go i went to an apple orchard  why did you go to an apple orchard did you pick them with your ass cheeks  would you take two and put them on your cheeks look at them  they're all now you put them under a shirt to get ready for a transformation  why do you go to an apple orchard yeah what are you doing because every year my girlfriend and her  friends go make you go no they go apple picking person and so i know person and person she's white 
[00:34:30]  apple picking no so we go apple person i'm talking about you oh they bring you to you know  oh even out the odds no to do the work oh that's not cool in person oh and then we get fresh donuts  he sings lead belly songs and picks apples right while they sip mint juleps  you actually uh you you get cider and yeah at the end there's a nice little store and you get fresh 
[00:35:00]  donuts and apple cider and if you want you can get a pie cider gives me the liquid shits  but that was such he's sharing such a nice story yeah and that was such an awful but honest fact to  throw out cider gives me the liquid one of my many problems is that my parents because they were so 
[00:35:30]  fucking poor when we grew up that i didn't really go to doctors much yeah so i had to figure out all  this shit as a as an adult what was wrong with me like what gave you things yeah for years i would  get fucking liquid diarrhea and i finally figured out it's from the apple cider i used to love apple  cider it's good you get it cold or hot cold is better i prefer cold as well cold that sounds good  though where is this fucking this yeah it's mo haven it's in northern westchester oh yeah yes 
[00:36:00]  i wouldn't mind some fresh apple pie oh that's the best fucking donut what we what we usually do is  you can't buy the apple pie there but did you get a dollop of whipped cream on it a dollop yeah  what the man calls whipped cream that he has to take in the bathroom and make by himself  a dollop out of his ballsack do you go there do you go there thinking you're getting some fresh baked  goods you know you know what a lot of i do too they suck you know a lot of those places they ship in  that shit for the tourists really they don't fucking grow it on oh really a lot of them bullshit 
[00:36:30]  a lot of not all of them but a lot of them especially in the new york area that's why we're  smart because then we went to the dickens farm did you go to the dickens apple farm dickens cider  yeah you had dickens cider get it dickens cider sounds like uh like like butt soup or something  can we play dickens cider today no i hate it which version our intern's version yeah oh that asshole 
[00:37:00]  that was the worst look i got a bit oh do ya yeah i remember this from fucking 15 years ago  but we're smart we take the apples and we go back to my girlfriend's friend's house  and the girl well the girls make a pie ew how fucking awful what a hair pie  no no an apple pie  i love taking his wonderful moment and just shitting all over it what a fucking nerd 
[00:37:30]  terrible day the guys cut the apples because they're not going to do any of the cooking of  course not what do you guys do while they're fucking all the women are cooking what are the  men doing docking yeah the men are draining the cum out of each other's balls and make room for  more fucking apples  ah shit what a fruit what are the men doing while the fucking girls cook oh well first we cut the  apples they make a couple pies so while they're cutting the first pie why don't you tell the 
[00:38:00]  broads to cut the apple exactly they could do the apple whore if they want to make their apple pie tell  them to cut their fucking apples and peeling apples too you gotta peel them so you peel them and cut  them yeah is it like fun are you laughing together yeah we all just drinking some cider everybody's  known each other for a long time we all talk about fun memories what's he doing now what's she doing  now remember last year we were cutting the apples and nothing happened yeah yeah what how so why are 
[00:38:30]  you doing this it's fun no it's not fun you have your own radio show made to do this you have a radio  show now that's saturday though sunday is for apple picking oh you're a fruit you think so yeah you  know what's fun getting blown that's fun right yeah get to the blow job buy a pie and fucking eat it  while all that money you fucking time you waste yeah you're getting blown they sell that shit in  stores you get an entomans apple pie you get some fucking cider you go home and get blown stick 
[00:39:00]  your cock in her mouth while she sucks you enjoy some apple pie and whipped cream a dollop a dollop  from the store at the entomans box on her head smells all nice and cinnamon like around the house  how long does it take to make apple pie i've never made it oh my god i mean it takes a couple hours but  we skipped over a lot what else did you do in the orchard oh yeah how do you go apple picking like  do you go oh that's a that's a good one yeah give me a boost  give me a boost i'm on my cock can someone give me a boost i see a good one up there 
[00:39:30]  will you pay by the bushel how many in a bushel uh however probably 25 or something i don't know  it's like fucking apples do you need well that's right if you're going to cook apple pie you need  to get apples to eat to bring home to eat and then also throw up minorities on the way home  on the fdr now it's starting to sound fun you don't do that that's why they buy apples no  they drive outside the special person school 
[00:40:00]  so how do you get up to the apples in the tree well they make devices there it's a long pole with  fleshlight  to give you a pole to cut down your own apples with a yeah it's a pole with a cup and a sliding  thing on the end of it so you got to bring it up and get the apple down sam get a picture up of  that picture this cup thing how much did you hate doing this i enjoy the apple she doesn't listen to  the show how much did you hate it she doesn't no how much did you hate it i don't necessarily like 
[00:40:30]  the act of picking apples but they're good people that we go and see who do you see yeah who's good  we went to the same high school so they're friends that we both knew oh god you bet it wasn't columbine  something to be said about a good school shooting huh  oh shit jesus oh fuck man what the fuck look at this nerd oh this nerd's got his 
[00:41:00]  like so yeah and on the end of that stick there's a tin can tin can nailed on his is homemade of course  it is oh he cut a v in it yes and you park the van and you grab the child's wrist and you pull  hard he comes in all you have to do is put the sticks underneath wouldn't the fun underneath the  apple if you were fun around there there it is yeah but can i ask you something if you hate to  clink if you're gonna cut if you're gonna like uh you know uh cut apples out of a tree wouldn't 
[00:41:30]  the fun be to try to fucking catch the thing at least if you're looking for any fun or climb the  tree something i did climb a couple trees now that figures and if the stupid apple hits the ground who  cares you move on to the next one is that how you got home no but you can you can climb up the tree  or sometimes you can reach the apple get it down with your hand you just made something that's  boring even more boring where it hits where it hits the tin can i hate the little the little 
[00:42:00]  clink the delicious treat drops in the can when you're at least trying to catch it as it's falling  out of a can i hope i hope they go to the wrong tree and it's all urinal cakes and every time they  think it's an apple it's a urinal mint make a pie out of it so you get all the apples you gather up  how many bushels would you say you take home it depends on the number of people but probably 
[00:42:30]  how many probably there's like six people you get three bushels three bushels of apples 36  yeah um probably a little more than 36 but yeah you gotta peel them all and shit well you don't  have to peel every single one then you divide up okay how many are we gonna take just to eat  oh divide those up oh geez and this is a discussion yeah like all right let me get the ones to eat  i would fucking be just just snoozing like you say this is better for just a cooking apple because  it's not bad but it like you're not gonna maybe it's bruised a little exactly got a worm in it 
[00:43:00]  exactly how'd it get bruised up in the tree yeah what happened maybe the wind knocked it against the  branch oh he's got an answer for everything i hope he doesn't accidentally gets a fucking  and open the shakes a bees nest open and they're stung into paralysis  he has to be taken out of the orchard in an ambulance breathing is labored  jabbing epi pens all over him yeah oh we didn't know he was so allergic  and they leave and there's just a bunch of apples strewn yeah the aftermath of the tragedy 
[00:43:30]  strewn apples and a dumb picker your girlfriend's leaning over your body she smells apple on her  finger and she gets sadder how long were in the orchard well we didn't go that long this time  because not that many people came a lot of people last minute canceled which was not that cool  it's something more fun like a wink right the last bit of cancellation that's people that had no  desire to do it in the first place and didn't know how to tell you they went one year and decided 
[00:44:00]  fuck that i'm never doing that again i'm sorry that's all right but you go around like you get  there around 11 or so in the morning and then you usually end up leaving around 130 ish 1105  11 like two and a half hours right because you got an apple pick for at least like an hour hour and a  half and then after the orchard there's the little store with everything and there's some goats you can  look at and some roosters i'd be looking at my watch is what i'd be fucking looking at what the fuck 
[00:44:30]  are you kidding me crafts people come and sell crafts what do they sell they sell like uh quilts  or nooses well once they take to washington dc try to get funding  not that kind of quilt no uh aprons bibs good yeah knee pads and then there's all kinds of foods you  can get a turkey leg or pumpkin cheesecake or pumpkin ice cream that sounds good turkey legs 
[00:45:00]  suck turkey leg you get the renaissance fair exactly they look kind of cool if you're at a  renaissance fair walking around but it's horrible food they're cooked in like bacon grease and they  taste bacony and they're just one bite and your fucking heart just fills up with fat wait a turkey  leg is not healthy like in a jewish deli i ordered them from a jewish deli once in a while you're eating  ligaments and fat and all sorts of shit well the turkey leg is probably very fatty but the way they cook  it too a lot of the a lot of those deep fried it's just deep fried if you're gonna have turkey 
[00:45:30]  you gotta have white meat oh fuck the leg i love the leg little guy sometimes you're lucky you get  some scrotum on there smell it there's a pizza truck oh pizza truck yeah this place just sounds  magical it's fun it really does orchard and how far of a drive is it it's about uh 20 25 minutes away  from where we are so if you guys wanted to come next year which you're invited uh that would  probably be like an hour for you guys an hour drive another hour and a half two hour two and a half 
[00:46:00]  hours at the orchard plus traffic plus yeah of course there's probably a lot of traffic coming in  and out of that place and then you guys are gonna come and make pie and then we come back to what your  place no no no to my girlfriend's friend's house that's where we do it oh why that's just where it's  always done tradition tradition she's got a nice kitchen seating for everybody come back to new  rochelle wait do you actually wait till the fucking pie is done and then eat it dick van dyke yeah 
[00:46:30]  oh fucking horrible sounds terrible about the apples already what an awful day this sounds like  it's a nice fall activity beginning of fall yeah just as it's starting to get cool and you can wear  your fall colors for the first time yeah why don't you fall and break your neck out of the tree  you have fall colors well we try to wear fall colors what what's fall colors earth tones are  very fally browns and oranges yeah so you you you wear clothes that uh kind of fit the the season 
[00:47:00]  yeah we're like the mood for apple picking like a green flannel shirt i wore is that a fall color i  hate everything about this you don't want to do this is there any pictures i'm getting pissed off  just just listening to him talk about this no because it's a waste of time monumental waste of  time i can imagine being dragged to things like this because i have been in the past nothing this  awful believe me this isn't bad it's awful you've done some awful things but it's like it's just like 
[00:47:30]  being all done awful things i'd rather be stuck behind fucking behind the belgians at the u.n  i i went pumpkin picking yes oh we all know about that a little red wagon i certainly did  all let's oh see and that's like there's a sunflower area i see the sunflower seeds in the  background why are you squinting oh just making a little fun face we're just having a good time  plus it was funny sunny your girl jess is just adorable see we just had such a great time like  that would make it better if i could go and hug her like that the whole time well you can't do that

[01:03:30]  though wrestlers don't like drugs or alcohol no they don't that's not true oh  hey did you watch um dance with the stars yeah i flipped through it because we're always on  is the situation gay i mean are people starting to wonder rumors um that he was an escort an escort  at one point but again it could just be a bullshit rumor something's going on with that i also  heard that he was like a dancer like a picture yeah you know what let me correct myself i'll pick 
[01:04:00]  you i'm sorry fag you're right it was actually dancer i heard not a male dancer what's going on with  him he's got a little lisp he's uh what's up with that could you hear him talk for that i don't  think you're crazy i think you're handsome it's very light in the hips something's going on with  him man he's not a great dancer though no well that spells one myth what's going on with the  situation the judges didn't does he got a does he have a real situation going on he might you don't know 
[01:04:30]  i'm mike sarantino otherwise known as the situation the man the myth the legend from jersey shore  i mean you can hate on me all you want to but what can you possibly say to somebody that looks like  rambo pretty much with his shirt off my dancing background consists of uh many many nights at  the club uh with uh your girlfriend uh uh uh just kidding brags about girls a little too much yeah  he's almost like your character what's going on with him he's got a very soft-spoken way of 
[01:05:00]  chat chat one yeah whoa okay okay mike did not finish filming jersey shore until a week before  premiere we're really at a disadvantage here walk walk how do you shake and walk at the same time  my first practice with karina was definitely painful not physically but uh you know visually  i don't even know my left foot for my right foot what a bore yeah it's not an entertaining show 
[01:05:30]  no not at all i don't know why i like him the situation yeah i do like him though she's gay oh  thank you no he just comes off as a little effeminate i just want to count his abs  do you like like ray charleswood though by touch  i think somewhere he's showing off his abs right now oh right now i don't know because  he seems to like to do that a lot yeah but he's also he's starting to get a little more picky about 
[01:06:00]  he doesn't just go on red carpets and do it anymore he says he's got to save it for the big money  but if he doesn't do that what has he got that's that's all he has to show his stupid abs off he's  got the name he's got the attitude he's got dancing with the stars we've made a star  out of a ginzo with abs yeah amazing country amazing he's got a book coming out fitness video  series i bet he sat and wrote the whole thing by himself he might have he had some help i think  some yeah i watched the jersey shore putting it all together i don't know what he or any of the other 
[01:06:30]  people do fucking party i don't even know what they do on the show i don't know why we're all  watching this show i don't know why they entertain in what way i haven't even caught an episode of  it i can't i can't you didn't see last week i mean there are fights going on it's great  fights i'd rather watch like intervention and hoarders oh yeah i've never seen him in the first  season i've seen moments moments of it but none of the whole thing when the show first hit it was 
[01:07:00]  it was it was awesome i was all in absolutely but by the end of the season i was done i never even  saw the finale of the first season like who cares see vinnie's uncle come and start flirting with  the girls who cares it's like an old guinea old school yeah how long is the show  uh it's an hour every week i can't uh i can't have the situation calls because someone is saying  the sitch matt z from east meadow oh careful he's a fan of you guys listens all the time i love the  i listen all the time bullshit guarantee the guy's never heard us it's never the guy that they're

[01:09:00]  dude wasn't there like 20 people there it was the greatest non-party ever it was probably the biggest  dud of a party at all of comic-con the entire weekend all right that was the one that no one  was at nobody yeah none of the celebrities turned up but the hoff cut came in on a helicopter well  it wasn't he there yeah but then he left before the party even started like he was gone yeah shatner  stay because he was hosting that thing is my outer space have a big buzz around it my outer space  dot com it's like my space but for outer space but it's all like space stuff no no it's not yeah

[01:10:30]  things but what is it i don't know what you need to do popular videos and i don't know i guess it's like  uh myspace you just kind of talk to people you post things on their little walls hey did you see  jupiter the same as it's been for the last four billion years you could talk about um sci-fi shows  like star trek next generation star wars levar burton kept getting blown off for sci-fi oh that needy 
[01:11:00]  motherfucker oh god how great is that i was so it's amazing because levar burton's a big  famous guy but to shatner he's nobody yeah i don't care about him no what were you in the  follow-up go fuck yourself yeah that was the show that you know pretty much took over for shatner so  why would he uh like them it really he was waving to shatner off stage like thinking shatner would  just bring him right on because it's just a web show and jordy let's get jordy up here from next  generation didn't happen he just said i'll get to you i see you oh dude it was so in front of

[01:33:30]  if people drop by and maybe you have a few things laying around you're like oh i'm i'm embarrassed i  didn't straighten up that's how she thinks this is oh look at my collector's oh god does that distract  you from the pile of cat shit over here in the corner oh god i didn't realize you were stopping by  could you give me a few moments to clean up my house yeah i didn't know you were coming can i have  a decade right and a flamethrower if i knew you to come you were coming on a baked my house 
[01:34:00]  i didn't know you were coming  let's hit this oh this is great meaning i love watching tv  i love it right but you can't see yeah what it's just filth she doesn't see the same amounts of  trash and filth and so i yeah i see some bags of a product oh what is those garbage dump stuff in 
[01:34:30]  here is still good what still usable what is usable what's usable not you when you have compulsive hoarding  it's very difficult to let those items go because they seem it's garbage  their brain will think of a million therapists and her fucking square face how they're going to be  used the reality the fact that the items don't get used again is part of that that brain process  that's just missing those connections and of course ordinarily we would do kind of a whole tour 
[01:35:00]  through the house but right now we're gonna get started and mix because the me me me thing  drives me right insane yeah whatever you know the reason but but what would happen if they just  start hauling this shit out of our house what would happen to this lady physically you know  mentally someone explain that to me why why is she handling her with kid gloves because here's what  happens even though they don't just go in and start throwing things away they bring the crew in now  the crew has to meet with the fucking crazy ass filthy disgusting hoarder right and and they they have 
[01:35:30]  to go over everything everything they take out they're like all right do you want to go through  this oh yeah yeah i need that because if they just took it all out they'd have a ridiculous  fucking freak out nervous breakdown so i know that's what i say all the time i'm serious so  no no i know what happens and then the healing can start right well no have your stupid breakdown  and then start healing you exactly bitch that's why i can't see why they're calling these  fucking serious i know these monsters in the end what happens to the lady nothing maybe she starts 
[01:36:00]  healing nothing enough already it all what does this cat turd remind you of right that reminds me  of the new deal the new deal the louisiana purchase i should do a clockwork orange to her  keep her eyelids open yes and just start throwing shit into a dumpster right in front of her face i've  said that so many times it's like what would happen just do it and what would happen shovel  the shit out of the house i'm a big believer in tough love and when you do that tough love stuff 
[01:36:30]  wow it's it's it's amazing what she'd be going what ends up happening stuff away they're throwing it  away and then what and then you go good watch it watch it then what happens yeah exactly those are my  cat turds and spider webs and dead animals and vomit you know how many dead cats they're going  to find underneath all this shit oh if they clean it out just dead from suicide  get all that a cat gun next to his head once you get all that emotion out though you would 
[01:37:00]  think whatever she's holding inside i don't know what shrink cycle babble taught these people these  other shrinks that this is the way to handle these disgusting monsters there's these self-centered  fuckheads there's a lot of good therapists out there and shrinks but there's also a lot of them  that seem to seem to have bigger problems than the people that are helping yeah yep right horrid  let's hear a little more from this wonderful woman oh she's not 
[01:37:30]  and clear before we can kind of get there okay yeah yeah okay feeling about the process of getting  started how you feel i want to get it over with i don't give a shit how you feel  why would you ask that i absolutely think that the precipitant of robin being willing to do this  undertaking right now she's not willing to be forced uh to be able to save the house or have  any option it's a garbage pile otherwise i really do think the situation would have continued indefinitely  poor cameraman of course yeah i know right i'd go in there in a second i would love to see that 
[01:38:00]  shit not to smell it and you're stepping on it when i was on you when i went fly fishing and i was  waiting for bob kelly and wandered around the town and i went up to a boom or that oh you guys that's  usually the music i hear in my head you want me to do that uh i uh oh you're fast forwarding whatever  and i walked up to a house that absolutely had a hoarder inside really oh yeah you just saw like  through the windows yeah through the window uh it was just a pile all the way up to the ceiling  they're i would love to go inside these places they're selfish disgusting people they're coops

[01:58:00]  by about 75 percent well we're trying okay no you're not yeah base to keep we are trying to do  look at that in a way that we will do in a more looks like the necromonicon throw it away item by  item what's in there and she's looking at every bag and making decisions looking in every just sneak  behind her back and throw out truckloads yes speed and trust and momentum goes up so i i don't need to be  pushing and prodding but this is all we've got oh pushing prod even the enablers getting frustrated 
[01:58:30]  i'd love to see the shrink just haul off and belt her oh god telling me to get everything away yes  what okay and again robin i'm not telling you to give stuff away we just don't have any way to get  through your stuff with the time we have allotted yeah and i want you to start thinking about what  you're able to use because i don't want you to see in the same position that you're in right now  damn this old bitch is worthless oh oh she's getting mad she's annoyed she's mad oh you got  bad the cleanup process comes to an abrupt halt as matt runs into a hazardous situation hazardous 
[01:59:00]  his foot gets stuck in robin's cunt we wouldn't find oh what is it what is it mid-day today i was  told there were some trash bags that could go and in typical hoarding style it turns out there was  more to those bags than than we thought when i confronted her it was it's definitely that was  her bathroom that was reported to her yeah that's bags of shit lady not everybody's business what  happened you just got out of hand for us we couldn't keep up on it no at a hand her and the 
[01:59:30]  father didn't vacuum isn't a lot of hoarding when the water shuts down what they don't know where to  go so this is poop this is all human feces it's a huge pile of white garbage bags oh god make the  choice in your life to take a crap in a bag and throw in the corner it is hard one time  this person has completely given up at one point in their life i mean this is  shove her face in it like a dog and go no no bad wow that's because if you

[02:05:00]  down in the shit pile could be comfortable the smell might be a little bit yeah a little sauce  smells bad let's be honest fresh shit not you gotta think that it might be a kind of comfortable  yeah yeah bugs these guys have to deal with oh jesus christ how do they got bed bugs how do they  fucking go home i would they'd have to go somewhere to be sterilized these poor fucking guys uh it's  really gonna say you're gonna get grouchy that's why you hate her thank you going through her  fucking beautician slowing everything up and he's just throw it out and bully her you want the box on 
[02:05:30]  the street or no i don't okay i haven't seen this one all right i want to know how this ends  oh god it's the closure everything is falling apart i think the ammonia in the cat piss has just  decomposed everything after the stairs to the second floor have been cleared matt makes a disturbing  discovery how many disturbing discoveries cracks in the walls over there we've got holes going all the  way through the steps you can look down all the way through the steps to the sunlight you know there's 
[02:06:00]  rooms back here that he said he's been in in 20 years i can see it it looks like a rat's nest  but i'm not even sure what it is oh it's so unsafe up here it's just it's it's and they were living in  this house yeah i was gonna write that room this is beyond fixing looks like a huge rat's nest now we're  seeing what it does to a house it tears it apart literally i mean these the foundation is ruined  this house is ruined they have to knock this yeah i hope she watches it's just not safe it's not safe at all  so unfortunately we're gonna have to stop yay it's just not safe at all to bring any of the 
[02:06:30]  guys in here we want to help you downstairs still but unfortunately we're gonna have to just stop  cleaning up there that was really bad news because there are a few more things that mom wanted to  save a lot of lost memories in there yeah oh well oh well maybe she shouldn't let a rat's nest take over  yeah hey mom should have got a broom city inspector arrives oh god he just slows the car down and  sticks his middle finger up and keeps going oh do you really need to take notes 
[02:07:00]  oh my god i'm not sure if their expectations are still hopeful that they can move in  i'm just not sure what the other woman's still hoping be very difficult for the family  bye-bye bye-bye the neighbors are going to have a parade down the street when the bulldozer comes  in let you know what we found and and water here's the inspector i love it with the situation we found 
[02:07:30]  a few cracks in the ceilings we found a hole in uh one of the rooms in the ceiling the plumbing  and electrical all need attention need to be looked at to make sure it's in working condition furnace and  the ductwork also needs to be checked out make sure it's safe dead cats the one thing that got my  attention was they didn't say that it's too bad it has to come down i kind of half expected that oh  please what we plan on doing is look at this talk about it see what we can do should have some for you 
[02:08:00]  within a week or two oh they're so knocking that place down i've been worrying about it quite a while now  i think i'm selfish so it was good news today good news  right today saying the family can live here what they're saying is you have some time and some  options to continue to make the changes that they made this week it's i think it might cost too much  to fix it to be able to keep it and uh we'll just see what happens even right now even with stuff 
[02:08:30]  cleaned out it's hard we want to save it but we do we want to keep it why of course you want to  why just like she wants to keep everything is there any more on her we could get the epilogue  and she'll have to and she'll go right back to hoarding right yeah she might yes like all  oh yeah he's not god damn how do they not can maybe they're going to knock the place down they  just want to do it in front of the cameras yeah i guess they want to keep it kind of positive or 
[02:09:00]  something no no is that how it ends is that the end it's how it ends it can't be the end i think  that's it but they don't show what happened with her yeah what the you got to go back you're missing  it's gotta be a recap yeah come on sam stop ruining everything they usually like put up some  fucking yeah fake and say what uh what happened hopefully she died i hope so too in a really easily  avoidable accident she slipped on her own fucking 10 year old feces yeah fell down the stairs she made a  zip gum and zip got out of cat shit and the police killed her 
[02:09:30]  ah fuck all right that's the other guy god damn these people are fucking kooks i guess they didn't  want to give the bad news in front of her thank you it's obvious they got to get rid of uh the house  what does this say i will talk with the city attorney and i will probably dismiss this is the other  guy the guy that all right that's bad other guy he was bad too though oh yeah yeah he was bad but  but but i mean that lady that lady i am skeeved out just watching that it completely skeeved me out 
[02:10:00]  yeah she was just terrible grouchy lousy fuck she must be oh oh all right that's the other guy ken  and then uh naomi naomi is i guess uh ken's uh chick there oh here it is yeah robin uh stated that she  has no interest in using aftercare what wait go back go back hold on hold on let's see what that  says i think she just pause it when it goes on the screen here we go robin has stated that she has no 
[02:10:30]  interest in using aftercare funds for therapy yeah of course not she doesn't want to use funds for  therapy no fucking content and then why am i so mad at her hit it since the family does not have  the 75 000 estimated for repairs the city will have no choice but to demolish the home and bill robin  nearly 10 grand 10 grand to knock your house down so happy the fact that she didn't want to go to 
[02:11:00]  therapy i just i hate her guts good hater good the therapy was for free obviously was that was that  it i have no interest i have no interest fucking rotten bags that is great she had she lost the  house it's gonna cost her ten thousand dollars hopefully she's out on the street with that one  box that the guy said you could be on the street with that box or have the house  uh so yeah i love that show 
[02:11:30]  it's enraging it's that was good though it is enraging that was some good tv right there  bitch yeah i loved it there are shows that are on that you just if they're infuriating and i can't  stop watching them that intervention is another one and um there's the other one uh hoarding buried  alive which is another ripoff of hoarders but not as good as hoarders well this lady was heading 
[02:12:00]  toward the second floor collapsing honor yes that would have been they had cracks from oh how great  they didn't explain because you didn't you know you didn't see it out there obviously but the second  floor had so much stuff it had to be weighing down yep the support beam yeah or whatever there was  cracks oh that would be great if she was just laying there downstairs and the whole second floor full of  her own shit cat shit bones dead animals just came tumbling down on her buried alive and people 
[02:12:30]  were found alive sorry people did bury themselves alive in in hoard hoarding oh yeah yeah in wars too  yeah oh all right your own garbage and everyone has uh my sister's a hoarder try to help you can't  oh wow animal hoarders isn't that what this is why i hate her though she had no interest in going to  therapy no no why would i i'm fine i think we should actually unfortunately it's smell but they  should just be left alone and drop dead yeah fuck it well the neighbor the fucking neighbors have to 
[02:13:00]  deal with that shit fucking walking past their house no matter how nice you keep your house you  gotta have fucking shit house next to you piggy mcshit cunt piggy mccat shit cunt lives next to you  fucking roach eggs you could actually probably buy a car for real cheap get insurance if you're the  neighbor and drive it right into the fucking house just drive it right into the corner of the house 
[02:13:30]  and go hey i don't know what happened and then the house gets knocked down another fix it terrible  solution get a car and drive it into the house just drive it into the house at least the show had  a happy ending which is certainly we all like happy oh thank god it worked out like shit not even going  for a joke happy ending totally her cats attacking her would have been a happy ending the whole  neighborhood's a lot happier the house is gone which means those people are gone yeah and there'll be a 
[02:14:00]  nice new house there oh my god and you know the conversations they'll have with the people that  bought the property and built another house on it oh thank god they're going to be like there's  going to be a line of people with cakes and house warming gifts welcome to the neighborhood we  love you it would be great if they hand them a cake and they just throw it on the floor we'll have  it later but what about the roaches that live there now and they knock the house down what happens  to the roaches they go to everyone else's houses oh god maybe it's not a happy ending the  rats should find other houses but yeah a rat's nest you ever see a rat's nest yes they're huge 
[02:14:30]  oh yeah mounds she probably thought it was cats up there rifling around do you think that was a  big fucking rat's nest that's what they were saying you couldn't get a good peek at it because the door  they couldn't get the door completely open they would have to do something like remove  the soil bring in new dirt like just to to because the dirt had to have been contaminated with  just ammonia and shit from the the animals 
[02:15:00]  oh all the mold can we get her on the phone oh god i'd love to fucking make fun of her yeah let's  talk like she's uh oh i'd love to help go ha ha help her love we find her yeah can we help her  uh you know i uh she's hoarding i don't need to be helped i'm fine out of hand out of hand it's a  little cluttered in here cluttered is that what you call 10 years of your own shit 10 years of our

[02:16:30]  one at a time over her head great with that plate collection meet hollow pointed bullet collection  rock collection or just break her spider webby plates overhead that is the best  way she'd be so upset yeah one at a time just standing there over that dumb bozo red hair  wow these phones chris in chicago related to a hoarder had to burn the house down that's great 
[02:17:00]  why don't we do a quick uh a quick one here because yeah yeah if you're on if you're on hold try to make  it quick because uh we got to move on to other shit uh in bags chris in chicago what's up hey  hey my uh my dad's uh ex-wife's mother-in-law her mother was uh a hoarder this was back like in the  late 60s early 70s and they got so bad that her husband moved out was living in his office because 
[02:17:30]  he couldn't stand to be there and then um they found a a big nest of wasps living in one of the  rooms and they just condemned the place a wasp nest wasp nest yeah it was uh they deemed it too unsafe  to even try to tear down and the fire marshals just burned it down burned it down just burned it with  everything aside they tried to burn it down yes actually stole two pieces of cat duty and tried to 
[02:18:00]  burn it down at robin's house and when robin tried to keep her collectible plates she had to be  corrected those plates bug me that they were even hanging on what are you trying to spruce the place  up except the lady in the tub was hotter than robin and that fucking at least there was just bodies  and ghosts there there was no duty yeah you don't think the collectibles were worth it terrible no  her dumb plates and her wind chime her one wind chime you uh killed your wife and daughter and then you 
[02:18:30]  threw your own duty on the steps for 10 years where is she now that's what i want to know oh sorry i  seem to have gotten some cat shit on you  i'm the type of man who likes to know who's piling up his own shit lloyd  welcome to the cat shit and dead body soiree

[02:19:30]  basically hadn't thrown anything out since 1955. wow that's 38 years was there anything good in  there disgusting you know what he had a stamp collection that my parents were able to recover  um they were told that it had been in good condition good not even meant good condition  could have been worked upwards of three hundred thousand dollars they got about ten grand for it  oh boy he had cash he got about ten thousand dollars worth of cash but he had him in 
[02:20:00]  like an envelope for the day if he had a dollar fifty in his in his pants to start the day he put  that dollar fifty in an envelope forget about it and stack a pile of papers on top of it we found  about ten thousand cash one envelope he had the most with about twenty dollars  that's a lot of envelopes took a long time i guess what an ass he was oh i don't get it what's  that based on i don't know there's it's some human instinct to hoard and to collect and to  it's some fucking wiring instinct wiring just gone fucking crazy we got a lady died in her house 
[02:20:30]  everything fell on her yeah we know that story what happened oh ain't that a shame let's say hi to  tyler tyler hey what's up boys hey brother hey the worst one i ever seen was this lady was sitting  out some ratty old chair they made her start cleaning up that was a value she was scooping  this cat litter off the chair and putting it into bags yeah yeah all the cat litter like the cats would  get it on their paws and walk around and she's sweeping it into a bag because she's going to reuse 
[02:21:00]  it for what dunce for in the cat box i guess for her dead cats oh god we got books with  lava in them we got cat shit and we got 800 pounds of human shit and 20 legs of cat  you like you like maggots and shit talk 
[02:21:30]  let's go to dean and maize  dean what's up  hey dean let's go what do you got around  saw a show where the toilet overflowed and they took the shitty water and put it in the tub  oh god oh my god that's a good one this guy goes i don't have time ah fuck it uh real fast kevin  kevin in north carolina go ahead hello hey boys uh just uh just wanted to chime in to let you know uh  the one thing about that show that is so wonderful is me and my wife watch it and whenever we get done 
[02:22:00]  watching it the first thing she wants to do is go and throw everything that she's got away  yeah it's inspiring makes it tidy up your house a little bit doesn't it after the show everybody's  a little bit shit that like you look at and go i could just throw this away we've all kept stuff  and that that instinct that you have that feeling that you have like i throw that you know what i'll  just keep it that probably gets multiplied a million times by 10 000 and you just don't throw it away 
[02:22:30]  nothing like you can't look at anything and throw it out i have stuff like a lot of career stuff and  work stuff that like i say but it's not dirty it's clean yeah yeah put away nicely there's a difference  between and i've noticed watching the show there's different types of hoarders there are hoarders that  are almost organized in their hoarding where it's stacked up and there's little pathways cut  through for them to walk in and then there's people like her which is just human shit that was a 
[02:23:00]  garbage dump it was a dump inside our house it's as if the neighborhood was just taking their garbage  and throwing it in our front door looks like a garbage monster yeah a garbage monster in our  it was a mountain of garbage i hoard blowjobs just save them underpants let's say i had a pirate  trucker from texas pirate trucker boys love you love the show of course of course um i was going to 
[02:23:30]  talk about my sister but this brings back memories of my divorce attorney i went over to his house and  it's just stacked with papers and i kept asking him i gotta go to the bathroom i gotta go to the bathroom  and he's like well you know yeah and he kept putting it off i'm like no i gotta go to the  bathroom he's like all right it's upstairs so i go upstairs go into the bathroom i'm taking a leak  and i just happened to glance over my shoulder and his tub was full of something i swear to god i thought 
[02:24:00]  it was his dead mother it was just full of goo and crap and i'm standing there gagging trying to  pee i come downstairs and i'm like and he's got this look on his face like oh now i have to kill  you yeah now you'll end up in the other tub i'm like this is just scott attorney what was it what was  it what was it what was it i i don't know i think it was probably his own wife yeah it looked like a 
[02:24:30]  decomposed body in the tub how about you call the fucking authorities yeah if it was a decomposed body  well when i see something that looks like it might be a dead body i i call somebody i got the  fuck out yeah all right good lawyer yep probably another lawyer and just laying in the tub oh this  guy this guy makes a lot of sense david in boston david he's going to explain why people save their  shit go ahead david i think it probably started with the same thing like with the wind chime she she  opened one of the bags to see if there's anything to save and realized there was some corn in there she 
[02:25:00]  could reuse oh god i want to save some peanuts and corn out of my shit it's still good let's go to  mike in boston mike mike hey hey so all right my mom was a hoarder so all these guys like all twice  removed all this crap i grew up with this stuff yeah the only thing that works i mean piles of stuff the  whole thing you know got way worse after i moved out going to work you drag her down inpatient care

[02:51:00]  going to get robbed oh damn so there was all these tunnels that were booby traps they didn't get robbed and  the blind brother would just stay in bed so the other guy would bring him food so that people  were complaining about a bad smell coming from the house so the cops took like two hours they broke  into a window and they found the blind brother dead in bed um for lack of food or water but he had  only been dead for 10 hours they missed him by 10 hours wow um so it wasn't the smell was not coming  from him so they started cleaning this place three weeks later they found the other brother 
[02:51:30]  covered under garbage like a pile one of the booby traps had got off went off and the rats had been  eating him get the fuck out of here oh that's why don't they make a movie about these guys there's  a book about them fuck books that's the credo of this show no but think about it though yeah that's  that's a much better movie than a reed yeah they were fucking disastrous what year was that in the  40 they died i believe in 47 i heard the uh mansion they call it a mansion but it was it was a building 
[02:52:00]  i guess it was like a five story fifth avenue in harlem oh 14 pianos 14 14 pianos the chassis of a car  or the jawbone of a horse i mean it was just complete lunacy he would fight it was all garbage too he would  find stuff and bring it home what what's standing there now it's a park it's a little a small little  park in harlem called collier brothers park no way no collier brothers park they named it after  those guys it's like a small brownstone-sized park why would they name it after them that's 
[02:52:30]  weird i see uh yeah since they're so weird why would they in my neighborhood all of a sudden  you'll see a park where a house is supposed to be it's the strangest thing oh yeah that's a photo  of the park and what ends up happening take a little like a little brownstone-sized park that's  nice but you'll see these parks where where a house should be connected to the other houses around  it and in some cases like the person dies they own the place and said no i want this spot to be a  park park and i don't know how they worked that out with the city it doesn't seem like that should 
[02:53:00]  be legal yeah like you can't just say there'll be a park where a house should be it's the strangest  thing the park is literally as big as this room and that's it yeah a hundred a little bigger but you  know 136 tons of stuff is what they got out of the place oh my god was it five stories someone  four or five four stories four stories high unbelievable wow 136 they they had no electricity  no water i mean just terrible i just don't get it i don't get how it gets to that point

[02:57:00]  are we hipster people i wouldn't say hipster stuff it's you for judah it's completely  natural it's called how to beat up anybody and it's all photos of this odd looking man  practicing yeah it's the worst karate ever yeah well he's he's the world champion so yeah he's  going to show you how you compete my favorite judah joke on stage is that he said uh something about  i have to run a marathon but i'm not going to practice i'm just going to cram the night before 
[02:57:30]  i think it's a very funny perfect judah joke he's he's a funny dude man he's fighting bigfoot in his  backyard in the book he's a really he's a fucking odd guy he is odd he's fighting a guy in a unicycle  like what is that what he's getting more lines on 30 rock i heard too i haven't watched the show  but i heard he's great and who told you that oh did i did you tell me okay at least at least i said  i heard i didn't just make it like it was not only did i tell you that i told you on the way home  yesterday oh i don't remember because we were discussing how judah's coming into  door sit-ups what the fuck is this i don't know what it is he's doing oven door sit-ups and i he's 
[02:58:00]  then he's dressed in a dress dude is a weirdo back squat i'm not saying it's a bad book i just  don't know what it is he's had how to beat up a man with three arms it's very odd he's fighting this  is an odd he's fighting old school like uh gang members on a subway this is an unbelievable  fucking uh like table book or toilet book this is great now he's in a strip club teaching him how 
[02:58:30]  to dance i think if i punch him in the chest i could dislocate his shoulder blade and he's showing  these pictures are hysterical this could be either the greatest book ever or the biggest waste of  time ever i don't know what it is him beating up a thug yeah uh he's speeding up by the train judah says  i'm careful not to hit him too hard i don't want to knock the train off its tracks and then this  special reverse angle the sloped railing is a wonderful tool for helping me crush his neck 
[02:59:00]  this creates a headache that lasts for about six years and it has him kneeing the man in the neck  around it's just idiocy but it's funny how to beat up someone on a unicycle he just shows him kicking  the guy off the unicycle i don't get this but i'm laughing  it's total it's utter nonsense why does he have a shitty shower that's the beauty of  judah he would have nothing good the shower is hitting him in the middle of the chest he's way 
[02:59:30]  too tall for his shower head this is complete and utter nonsense why is he at the grand canyon  with sticks on fire he's a weirdo what is he doing he is but here he is the chapter for women only  yeah which unfortunately all of the women look exactly like judah dressed in women's clothing  the glasses and hat he's trying to claim that a karate kick fucked up this building go to page 66  he's taking how to beat up someone with one arm he walks up to him it's three pictures he's walking 
[03:00:00]  up to him he pulls out um like hedge clippers and clips the guy right in the balls what page there's  no reason to do that 112 there's no reason for that  he's just what is this it's a lot of pictures oh that's funny oh he's grabbing his cock yeah  hedge clippers he grabs the guy's cock that's very funny easy to carry hedge clippers in his 
[03:00:30]  back pocket you can you can't even really do this justice by describing there's a lot of photos it's  funny yeah a lot of photos a lot of notes uh little circle things and drawn in notes on the pictures  his face is hysterical he took a lot of pictures yeah jesus christ a lot of uh let's love judah next  he is a an odd guy he really is he's beating up a tyrannosaurus rex of course he is why wouldn't 
[03:01:00]  he this tyrannosaurus rex cannot block my karate kick because i used proper technique what the  fuck i don't i don't um why is he naked he's naked in one shot yeah he's got a great body he's up  with strippers on a pole he's in jacuzzis yeah well i guess we'll we'll talk to him i'm sure we won't 
[03:01:30]  get an answer out of him either but um i'm uh to beat up anybody i'm twittering  a very funny photo maybe he doesn't want me doing this but one photo that i took which one  uh a screen cap called disable the attacker yeah  what happened just very what was he doing that's where he's grabbing the guy's cock with  all right yeah uh he's 15 minutes away he's stuck in traffic well we're only we should um 45 today 
[03:02:00]  we should take a break so i can make a wee wees all right let's do that okay we'll um be right back  after this the virus i can't believe anyone is still listening for this show you're listening to  obi that's pretty cool yeah uh really fast thank you kevin from connecticut braylon edwards 
[03:02:30]  arrested on dui charges who's that playing for the jets oh jet superstar oops 5 30 this morning i guess  drinking and driving what the fuck does that mean that would be when it happens so what what does the  league do now um i don't know it's a legal matter is it a morality cause is he allowed to play like 
[03:03:00]  i bet who knows this shit we need him for the fucking dolphins game i bet until he gets um  some kind of uh trial he's all right he's all right then you think maybe oh yeah yeah innocent  until proven guilty unless you play for the nfl yeah then forget about it then it's a whole new  set of rules you got to follow another story forget about it forget about 
[03:03:30]  forget about where's uh juda friedland i was in traffic juda i did an interview and it's an esquire  magazine no you didn't what i did but i'm only mentioned once it's just about uh my happy ending  so she quotes me and then just lists a bunch of the things that i told her nice  about the terms you use when dealing with a prostate like roses you don't say how much money  like how many roses why oh right dollar per rose you know can't say that wouldn't wouldn't people 
[03:04:00]  know that means money and of course they would no but i mean and then you would get in trouble for  that people just get arrested for it everybody thinks they're slicking in the cops dude they can't  give you a ticket if their lights aren't on what okay i love that so guys are getting arrested for  using the roses thing yeah yeah everybody becomes an expert you know you gotta say you're a cop if you're  a cop i will say nope i'm not a cop and then yes you're under arrest smart uh  one smart strategy i saw was on the chris hansen show the one guy who went in there is like 
[03:04:30]  what it was a role play the whole thing was a role play room it was a role play the whole he would not  stop saying role play role play he was the only one that was acquitted or got off wow because  literally i guess they can't prove that you don't think it's role play wow that's the angle i wonder if  that's why they stopped the show because once that angle gets figured out literally you're not talking to  a child yeah yeah i but i think there is a law that says that even if you aren't but you think 
[03:05:00]  you are again that's where the thing is this guy just kept going it was role play it was the whole  thing was a role play he was like yelling that out the window in the police car yeah well it might work  in court but i wonder if it worked with his wife oh no i'm sure yes it's role play yeah where yeah like  all of a sudden you play with a bunch of roles or something like oh working in a uh uh bakery yeah  yeah bakery i forgot i've helped you finish your joke there chip yeah it's mine though get it go 
[03:05:30]  asshole oh shit it's angry angry chip  yeah uh i don't know i think it's um i think it's still illegal i don't know how he got off of that  i don't know either once you uh engage in a conversation with somebody that you believe  is underage but again you don't believe they're listening slacks they're role play oh so you're  saying you're going to fuck a 20 year old who's just pretending to be dirty and young oh okay whoa 
[03:06:00]  that's a pretty good one yeah gotta give him that i use that when i try to bust you for coke oh wow  yeah this is chip who does everything one-ups everybody we understand  oh god that would work i guess huh yeah see no we're role playing she said she was that all  and then that's it you know i knew she wasn't right and she wasn't so it's not like she really was  young all right i could get back on the computer you enjoyed having me in your studio yes oh god 
[03:06:30]  yeah so you're anthony from the opian anthony show i remember when i saw him on the street out  there by madison and like 49th still trying to get your email anthony how are you uh good i don't know  you tell me how am i what do you know have you been following me chris hanson get away from me i hate 
[03:07:00]  chris hanson jerk chris hanson rules why don't we uh say hi to judah freelander who's right outside  the studio okay yeah that was called um stalling was it yeah we were stalling a little nice  here he comes judah freelander world champion judah freelander we've been perusing your book all  morning yes very enjoyable an instructional and inspirational karate book how to beat up anybody  by the world champion himself judah freelander that's right man i was um laughing my ass off 
[03:07:30]  i i'm not quite sure what it is but it's funny yeah well it's uh you know  it reminds me that's what it's supposed to be dude yeah yeah and there's a lot of pictures in it  for weak readers like myself you know and there's naked chicks in it i got naked strippers  oh yeah you do you know everything's real it's a documentary it's a documentary everything's 
[03:08:00]  real 100 real yeah i i it's the greatest karate book ever written man it reminded me a lot of the  old classic national lampoon oh those are great like the old like the 70s and early 80s yeah yeah  that's it i i would laugh until i couldn't fucking breathe oh cool well thanks man i'm a big fan of  those and that is absolutely what i was thinking when i i started seeing this because it's very  fucking funny page 12 man 12 page 12 yeah i'll teach it you'll be able to do that oh man you'll 
[03:08:30]  be able to do that after you read the book oh wow there's some great ball kicking in this yeah i'm  lifting a guy up about four feet in the air by his nuts and kicking another guy about five feet up in  the air by his nuts and look at page 13 i'm beating up burt johnson right in front of his own karate  school oh i see that one karate kick to his head i just obliterated is that blood on the wall that's  blood on the wall yep just splattered his head yeah we went we went through a bunch of it before  it was very uh you fight bigfoot in your backyard and very practical i'm confused by how to beat up 
[03:09:00]  someone with three arms judah oh there's no one out there with three arms yeah there are dude there  are yeah well um well you know the book is almost all pictures but there's a lot of words in it too  yeah and uh if you read the words it talks about how with pollution becoming a bigger and bigger  problem there's more and more child deformities people being born with third arms and they're  kind of pissed off about it and then in the future because i have a time machine in the future yeah 
[03:09:30]  additive limb surgery is like the steroids of the future so you're gonna have like rich kids being  born and their parents want them to be athletes so they get an extra arm put on them so they'll be  better at sports so this is a beating up someone with three arms is going to be a bigger bigger  problem in the future he looks like the comedian rondelle i know too but yeah yeah yeah his name  is actually fred his name is actually fred yeah yeah if you read uh later in the chapter later in  the book we actually become friends after i beat him up and uh he told me that his name was uh rondelle 
[03:10:00]  but to call him fred why are you jim excellent you're wearing more than one dress i notice in  the book well there's one chapter i mean i think we would give you one dress wearing yeah there's  two or three in the book well women women demanded that i wear three different dresses in the book and  i have a special chapter for women only and uh as guys you can't even read it and uh comprehend it  i can punch a man's shadow and knock him out yeah yes no i have a whole i have a whole chapter on on 
[03:10:30]  my shadows and how it's probably better to study my shadows before you study me because my shadow  moves slower than me and these drawings karate philosophy are gibberish yeah there's a lot to learn  shibberish shibberish yeah that's uh well you know i mean these are terrible drawings of stick  men well look at this well look at this one dude i have an important tip of how to beat your opponent  you kick your opponent directly over the hospital right into the cemetery and the hospital man 
[03:11:00]  the hospital is a fucking it's a rectangle it says hospital on it there's no windows yeah it's a  horrible drawing well it's a horrible drawing but it depicts karate perfectly perfectly of  course yeah i liked uh the fighting uh the guy with the one arm yeah i beat up a guy with one  you have a whole chapter coming yeah i have a whole chapter on how to beat up someone with one  arm not with only using one of your arms but if you actually have to fight a guy who only has one 
[03:11:30]  arm yes yeah that's that's also an important uh yeah because you know that one arm is twice as  angry as uh normal arm because uh and you know he's been in a fight before you know yeah of course  so the guy's got experience he lost his arm karate and uh yeah the one-armed man um very  angry table book though man people will just you pick it up it doesn't matter where you start you  can just peruse it for a little bit thanks man there's a lot of words in it so it's even more 
[03:12:00]  than a table book i'm hoping that uh hotels will replace all their bibles with this to keep people  safe on the road it would be so much better yeah you know and the unicycle yeah i show you how to  beat up someone on a unicycle and if you come across a unicycle they're tough they have good  balance they're used to working alone but you take them out pretty quickly yeah i take it one kick  he's out and then i do a pogo stick to the head and he's he's dead did you actually go to the grand  canyon i did yeah that's all all the photos green screen not that the the grand canyon has has no uh 
[03:12:30]  photoshop effects everything's weird did you go out there for the book everything's weird was right  yeah everything's weird everything's weird go out there for the book or you just happen to be at  the grand canyon no no let's take some no i first i first started this those photos are from six years  ago at the grand canyon i first started this book six years ago yeah and that that's when i got the  idea and then about a year and a half ago uh you know i'd work on the book off and on you know  over the past five years then about a year and a half ago a few uh you know book companies publishers 
[03:13:00]  came to me and said hey we want you to do a book and uh and i was like well i got one for you  but the past 16 months it's been non-stop working on the book did you know that honestly when you did  these because when i started writing something i was doing it kind of i kind of had an idea like  i would do a book with this stuff eventually did you know this was going to be in a book were you  just being silly when you actually took these first no i mean the ones that i took at the grand canyon  i actually took myself i had the camera on a timer yeah and then i'm literally about 
[03:13:30]  a foot and a half away from the edge of the grand canyon and i'm doing these like big jumps up and  down and i would just time it with the timer and yeah it was all because i was i was going to make  the book regardless whether someone was going to print it or not you know it's something i want to  do it and it's all based on my stand-up act but with all all new material there's no material from  my act in it it's very funny man and thanks creative and original yeah i show you how to uh three women  with their fucking heads on fire yeah those are half alien chicks that's why that's a picture of  me at the grand canyon which i state in the book is one of the the top 10 canyons in arizona for me 
[03:14:00]  to train at and uh and uh but i when i i karate kick these chicks heads on fire because uh you know  in the hot dry desert it's it's just too dangerous for me to do karate of course i'm starting to think  that you are the world champion oh yes i am man it's pretty cool how to beat up anybody dot com is the  website where people can buy it online and it's in stores october 5th they can check out some of  the book on yeah yeah yeah i have about 10 pages on the book that's smart and i'm gonna have updates

[03:15:00]  for your notes you need notes well this one is this page is not blank it is filled with the screams of  pain from everybody the world champion beat up while making this book yep weirdo it is it is completely  ridiculous yeah and hysterically funny yeah that's what i was going for man complete insanity and uh  yeah i've never worked harder on anything and it's all to give back to the people so that they can  you know defend themselves in in real life situations like big foots and ninjas and 
[03:15:30]  yeah ninjas riding on the backs of uh yeah well the stripper section i i have uh naked strippers in the  book yeah i saw and uh a big shout out to all that's because i train them you know because  yeah they need self-defense more than a lot of other people vulnerable and uh i want a big a big  shout out to all the girls at the harem in lodi new jersey oh the harem for letting me train them  every day i don't know the girls at lodi success has not changed you i'll say that you're the same  guy i've known for 15 years you're the man juta has not changed a bit we first met at i think woodstock 94 
[03:16:00]  oh my god that's what i first saw you really do you remember eating a sandwich and like taking a photo  in a port-a-potty oh yeah that's right first matt norton i'm like this guy's cool do you remember  we were walking around were you there was with levy we were trying to find the african the singers  the the african band we were all in a giant tent and the guy had a giant cock in his shorts  and me and levy and florenti were sneaking over giggling every morning pointing at the guy's  cock bulge we're trying to get all the comedians to go look at the guy's penis bulge 
[03:16:30]  i did not see that one but and there were a lot of crazy stories because it was they called it a  tent but literally it's an awning and there's about 200 people sleeping under there and sleeping  back it's massive and there were all these like spoken word people and and world beat music people  and they were always being taken care of and the comedians they just didn't tell us a thing nothing  and so we were just like left on our own and i spent the whole first day walking around the 
[03:17:00]  entire grounds which is miles trying to find the stages we're supposed to perform at and then we  get to a stage and there'll be nobody there it was terrible and then friday night we finally we  finally put on a show do you remember brick mason i do i remember brick mason was throwing mud on  himself outside the co-ed showers right yeah and you know why he was doing that he was because he  would just shower instead of going to the concert they had they had one set of co-ed showers  where we were staying and uh and brick would i would see brick late at night like shriveled up 
[03:17:30]  like a raisin i'd be like dude what have you been doing he's like dude i've been uh taking a shower  i'm like for how long dude i mean he was he was literally there all day he would take a shower  throw mud on himself and go back in so he can just be in the co-ed showers for six hours  metallica's rocking out on stage and brick is just showering all day that's all he did he didn't  see one concert that's a really good guy he didn't get laid he didn't see one concert but  he showered all day i got photos of bob levy from that when he was on mushrooms and he took he showed 
[03:18:00]  his cock it literally is a quarter inch long and a naked man went up on stage and chased them it  really was a fucking filthy event i saw one guy i remember i was watching uh it was after metallica  and uh aerosmith was on it was about 1 30 in the morning this is like the first night when all the mud  stuff started yeah and uh um there was um there's this whole area it's like a lake of mud it's  probably about you know half mile long and probably about 30 feet wide and i was up front in the mosh 
[03:18:30]  pit all day and i was like screw it i'm i'm gonna go just you know hang out in the area here where  where nobody is because it was you know yeah and then then some biker dudes started hanging out and  then and then uh we get to sort of start slam dancing and then all of a sudden we look to our left  and there's this long blonde haired guy completely naked jerking off while watching aerosmith  and then and then we're like okay we'll move over here about 15 feet give this guy his space 
[03:19:00]  and then next thing i know i see one of the biker guys running being chased by the naked guy with a boner  they disappear into the crowd about 10 minutes later the biker comes back and i was like what was  that all about that guy was on some crazy stuff and then the guy just goes yeah he's out cold i'm  like what he passed out and he goes no elbow to the head so that guy's probably buried 20 feet deep  somewhere up in uh still there yeah knocked out with a heart on watching your favorite band 
[03:19:30]  that's a fan though why jerk like just leave the guy alone yeah he must have thought  somebody was around him hey we gotta ask dude about some of the places oh yeah that's what  was always one of my favorite things we ask is because uh we did a whole hour on hoarders today  and then jimmy's like dude is coming in and he's lived in some shitholes yeah not not that you're  a hoarder well if you turn to my book if you turn to my book yes i have some exclusive photos from my  training ground at home oh actually you know what there's a karate quiz in the book go to page one 
[03:20:00]  page 173 uh dandy you take that one go to page 173 in our workbooks ah what do you see this is a  quiz i have a quiz at the end of the book to see uh if what what what you've learned you know because  i teach all this karate and then at the end it's all about analyzing and putting together so what do  you see in that a lot of world champion hats okay i see you crutches i see you in uh camouflage i  think sorry about you know you have one second to answer right your answer below you're you're in uh 
[03:20:30]  you're in waiting there yeah i was hiding yeah i see you hiding right there yeah in a dirty room and  you saw it and it took you too long but you're the only person in this room to actually have passed  the quiz yes wait where are you i'm right here dude waiting to attack you yeah yeah so all that  time you were like analyzing the situation you didn't analyze it fast enough like i could have  killed you waiting to attack but yeah that's in my uh that's in my uh world champion in this photo 
[03:21:00]  you're a little higher up so your eyes are a little bit more visible whereas in this photo  well here i'm in full hiding position that was to prove that he was in hiding and then here  wow i'm actually i would never getting ready is that yeah is that your house yeah you're a hoarder  oh dude early stages of i am the world champion of hoarding dude early stages this is where it all  begins no i think i'm way past the early stages are you really bad do you hoard stuff oh yeah dude  yeah yeah it's insane man that's why i keep moving my favorite story i live in queen it's more space 
[03:21:30]  you get a better place now though you're making money in your great career i like queens though man  queens is all right queens is good good people good chicks a lot of space what i still don't see him  are you trying to turn to the next page no he's it's the campion is that how you say it  del mundo campion del mundo hat yeah in the middle of the room that's actually a table  yeah that he's leaning he's there you see him he's crouched down and his hat you don't see him 
[03:22:00]  and his hat brim is just anthony you're really not passing this quiz dude i could have killed you  20 times already i just see his hat because you're thinking this is a long table i bet you but it's not  a long table that's a short oh it looks like a long that's okay that's what i'm thinking that's where you  we're confused right norton thanks for pointing it out you're welcome man it's hard i would have  been attacked it's like the goofus and gallant quiz and highlights magazine what's different about  these photos and you could never tell yeah then you realize gallant was helping the old lady and  goofus was shitting into her mouth you're like oh that's the difference goofus gets it oh what 
[03:22:30]  you're gonna bring up a place you used to live in just all the the great uh fucking just it's  great to see you succeeding because all the great horrible places you lived oh yeah me yeah i used to  have one place i used to live at the george washington hotel that's just which is which is now somehow a  school of visual arts dorm they converted it to where it was on 23rd and lex  yeah and this was back in i first lived there 91 so this is when that was a bad area people were 
[03:23:00]  always selling junk on the sidewalk all day and those people lived in the building so they're like  hookers live in the building and uh and then some people because of the weird laws it was a hotel years  ago they actually still had maid service but the my room was six feet by nine feet and i could stand in  the middle of my room and touch both walls oh and then the uh the closet was about a foot and a half  long but it was only six inches deep so i'd have to put my hanger in at an angle the hanger actually 
[03:23:30]  couldn't fit through and it was roach infested i remember i actually had i found roaches uh they  were all over the place every time i opened the door like a roach would crawl down and i never knew  where it was coming from and then until one day i opened up the door and it was on the side paneling of  the door where you couldn't even see in the door jam yeah because it was just uh body-to-body roaches  oh and then we did a video of of me uh spraying it and then like literally like 60 roaches fall down  at once oh my god the roaches were living in my vhs videotapes they would like have mess in there 
[03:24:00]  i actually had videotapes with roaches in in like the plastic how do you sleep like that though like  how do you sleep knowing they're in the room oh i got the well uh yeah you just shake everything man you  you shake everything when you anytime you put any clothes on in the morning you just shake stuff out  first you get used to it wow you really get used to it did you ever find one crawling on you what's  that you're a fine one on you in the bed or something probably man wow yeah those things  kind of got desensitized you know roaches creep and then i had no kitchen i just had one of those little 
[03:24:30]  hot plates that you plug in uh but my sink was only about six inches by seven inches so i would actually  have to put a glass in there fill up with water if i wanted to cook spaghetti then put it in the  pot and just keep and then and then keep filling it up and then i had to do my dishes in the shower  because it couldn't fit in the sink and there was no tub what an awful place now he's on 30 rock 
[03:25:00]  i remember one time and the and the window just looked to like the inside of the block so all you  just saw was this dirty old building bricks and then yeah one time i i i see some guy on another  part of the apartment building about you know 30 feet down out his window and he's and this is an  this is on 23rd street so it's sort of faced the middle of the block and uptown and he's just screaming  and he's just going fuck you midtown fuck you midtown like literally like 10 minutes straight that's 
[03:25:30]  all he's doing and i was like okay this is a good place that's a holy shit and i finally moved out  and then it took me like before you moved uh did you have rats there no there were no rats or mice  it was too small too small for rats or mice you didn't share bathroom right no i was lucky no yeah  this actually had its own it was it was a step above an sro well you know what those are they don't have  too many of those anymore that's a single room occupancy where you have your own apartment but the  bathroom's in the hallway and you got to share with everyone else who lives on the floor how much 
[03:26:00]  a month was that place 470 and i thought that was too much 470 for wow yeah this is 91 though i  remember looking at an apartment uh it was a share you know and this is pre-internet so you have to  get the village voice the day it comes out right and then look for uh apartments yeah i remember seeing  one from like uh 10th avenue and like 50th street um to share it it would be to live in uh the living  room which was also the kitchen and it was an old railroad apartment and the tub was also in 
[03:26:30]  the the the kitchen the tub was right next to the the stove and it was 270 a month wow but i'd have  to live in the living room and it was with like a six foot five gay german model and i was like  how'd you not you should have charged you 570 yeah drunk off while you showered i should have  gave him your number dude i should have gave him your number so you lived in so i skipped that one  man just terrible terrible living conditions for so long yeah well new york's tough you know and then 
[03:27:00]  it's amazing they're allowed to rent a place with a closet that's six inches wide and yeah literally  the hangover hanger could not fit in if you put it in straight you had to go at a diagonal so did you  have to like bend the hooks of all your hangers plastic ones i had plastic ones that sort of  warped and bent and then after a while i was just like forget it you know i didn't even use it you  know and the thing is so i had a twin mattress because you couldn't even get a a full-size bed  in there let alone a queen or anything like that yeah i had a twin mattress and i'd prop it against 
[03:27:30]  the wall during the day and then i would i would put it on the ground at night when you would lift  it would you see roaches under it no no no no i think they were all in my tv door and vcr  in the tapes yeah they like the warmth right yeah and i had no cable and it only got like  two channels but a horrible reception i remember trying to watch the super bowl in 91 and it's just  it looked like the like from the 80s when you didn't have hbo and they would just scramble it  yeah you know that that's what it looked like when i was watching the super bowl it was so depressing 
[03:28:00]  you depressed yeah yeah and then every night at 3 30 a.m i'd hear the uh the bed squeaking upstairs  i don't know if the guy was uh getting late or jerking off or what but what was the for how long  until you started getting like like because i remember when you started getting some good acting  gigs because you could act it was like then you started getting like real paychecks but you were  in the business for a fucking long time i started to stand up in 89 and then uh acting my first acting  gigs where i was able to like quit my day job was 90 it was 97 or 98 you know um and that was for tv 
[03:28:30]  commercials i was able to finally get a commercial i did a nf uh bunch of nfl commercials and uh and  then i did you know bud light heineken you know tons e-trade you know so for like two three years i  did tons of commercials and then the first um actually you may have auditioned for it too man  uh the first like one of the first tv acting gigs i got actually the first tv acting gig i got was 
[03:29:00]  late line al franken had a show called late line kind of behind the scenes at a news show yeah and  i played like a video tech guy and i'd work with miguel ferrer uh who was awesome you know he was just  super cool and uh and then um my first break in the movies was uh meet the parents um oh right right  right yeah a little part meet the parents and then there you are started doing movies i just saw i just  saw you meet the parents the other day it was on well it's always on this movie but yeah that's the 
[03:29:30]  one with the is at the liquor store right yeah yeah the whole i uh sell stiller the mums yeah the mums  you get a lot of i made up that line that is great man that is a funny fucking line yeah yeah that was  fun to do he was cool we pretty much improvised that scene i'm wearing a corn shirt underneath the  shirt yeah yeah under yeah i wanted to wear the hat but they wouldn't let me wear the hat but uh  yeah that was fun to do we what's funny about that that pharmacy scene and meet the parents 
[03:30:00]  uh we filmed it at a real pharmacy in long island and they didn't shut it down and i'm guessing because  it's like a legal thing people like have to get their medicine so literally me and ben still are  doing the scene and all the staff the real cashiers are all to the left of me squeezing the corner  and then we do a take and then they go cut and then the customers would come in and then i'd squeeze  over to the other side they'd bring a couple people up and then we do the take again unbelievable  yeah it was really goofing what time what town was that in that uh you know remember it's oyster bay 
[03:30:30]  in the movie but we shot it in great neck it was great yeah it was i forget the name of it but it was  a drugstore in great neck right yeah huh yeah that was cool it's fucking amazing though man i always  like it's always nice to see guys who fucking you know pay their dues uh i fucking hate comedians  that get shit immediately yeah man i hate it well in the long run it doesn't make them good comedians  you know what i mean it's like you gotta live in squalor for a while you know what i mean yeah  or eat your balls or fucking do food spots for years yeah yeah comedy teller yeah i mean it makes you 
[03:31:00]  know what's a food spot oh at the cellar yeah before they had all paid spots the cellar now basically  sunday through thursday has two shows a night uh you know from nine to eleven and eleven about one in the  morning it used to be a continuous show from 9 p.m to about 2 a.m and at about 12 30 that was about  the last paid spot it was almost always david tell doing the last paid spot and then after that they'd  have about anywhere from five to ten comics going on doing anywhere from five to fifteen minutes they 
[03:31:30]  always changed it and you wouldn't get paid you would at first it was actually wasn't even a food  spot it was a drink spot you get one drink ticket for going on and then it got upgraded to a  food spot you got a meal and then it got upgraded to 20 bucks which was the regular paid spot pay  because russman eve ruined the food spots because russman yeah he did that motherfucker could could  literally eat two hundred dollars worth of food and they're like and then they just made them all 20 
[03:32:00]  minute paid spots yeah but yeah judy did those for years i did them for a long time and i remember  noam liked me which is manny's son you said you were getting paid spots before i was i was there  before you but you were getting paid spots before me damn and uh i mean i think i first started going  there i probably first started going there in like 93 i probably first started doing late night there  mike royce was an emcee ray romano used to be an emcee a lot yeah yeah mike royce fucking exec produced  uh everybody loves raymond and now he's doing his new show yeah he's doing his new show mike royce is a 
[03:32:30]  fucking millionaire he has a few bucks stashed away he's a millionaire he was exec producer of lucky  louis he was a showrunner he's a really funny guy but it's cool it's like uh and the seller's still  awesome you know i mean best club in the city you know it's just uh it's the best deal you know it's  the cheapest uh the drinks are like normal prices and uh it's it's just the best seinfeld was there last 
[03:33:00]  week twice really yeah walk in to go on and uh you know jerry's on he's doing like the 9 15 spot  were you mad like oh get off no i heckled i heckled to help him out you know  yeah he doesn't usually go that long though i think when he does a guest spot you know some guys will  uh you know go up just show up unannounced and blacks i'll say it the blacks go a long time  my my favorite my favorite uh a comic showing up unannounced and just doing as long as they want 
[03:33:30]  was in la at the comedy store because i work kind of took me to la from like 2002 to 2004 and uh yeah  there were three guys that had that had the red carpet no no there was dice uh it was joe rogan or  eddie griffin and if any of them showed up they could go on as long as they want even if the other two  guys are there so it was kind of it was like it wasn't smart marketing by the club it's like no  if you consider these three your biggest acts you would want and they're all there you would want 
[03:34:00]  to get them all on so one night eddie griffin is there he's going up for about he's already been  on stage about an hour so crowds starting to leave he's just you know blabbering and and he and he's got  some of his guys with him and all of a sudden he goes he goes and uh one of his friends is ricky  that's hanging out with him and it's been an hour into his set he's like oh man i gotta take a leak  man he goes hey ricky why don't you come up here do a couple minutes while i take a leak  and then ricky comes up from the back so excited he's like how you doing everybody good to see 
[03:34:30]  you uh you ever notice white guys run like this and they act like how white guys and uh mexican  guys run like this chinese guys run like this and before he gets to like his fourth whoever kind  of guy runs like this then eddie griffin's in the back he goes yo ricky i already took my league  bring me back the fuck up man and then ricky goes hey that's my time everybody back in  how horrible and then eddie did like another two hours it was the most depressing thing i felt so 
[03:35:00]  bad for that guy i didn't listen i didn't stick around i've seen uh dice do marathon spots yeah  at the comic store but i was just like on two three hours i've never seen a comic bring another  comic up so he could take a piss break i've never seen that yeah that horrible that's  ridiculous talk that long i just can't comprehend it hey where you at with 30 rock there judo 30  rock my favorite shows on tv we're filming they haven't been using that much this season we're  sort of filming three episodes i don't know dude you were getting some nice fucking lines i know but

[03:38:00]  he's in his 80s or 70s but he's still hilarious and you just think it's like why isn't someone in  hollywood putting this guy on a show he's still so fucking funny do you think he still doesn't want  to is he done or does he not want to well you know i talked to him some for some reason uh i mean  harvey corman i think was still alive then when i met him but he was those guys were all harvey was  alive when you met him no no no i didn't meet him no no but when i met uh conway um but uh you  know they were going on the road doing shows together and stuff so i'm sure he'd want to do it 
[03:38:30]  and it was still funny man you need something to happen like what happened with fucking betty white  right exactly you need this surge something happens you don't know what it is but so they  just right i mean it wasn't like betty white just got funny you know you know what i mean she's always  been great you know you know you know how many betty whites are in hollywood just rotting away  in a room somewhere yeah that's what's weird about hollywood man you see i'm sure there's people  everywhere betty whites that could do just what she's doing but they're not going to give them a  chance so much about hollywood is about who's you know so-called cool you know or who's the it person and 
[03:39:00]  then because no one in hollywood has an opinion of what's funny well we need the kardashians on tv  yeah before we need tim conway yeah we need more of them we need more of them that's right it's  uh it is amazing the garbage decisions they make it's that fucking youth movement in hollywood is  so enraging rickles was on uh leno recently killing and he's was he and he's 80 something  yeah right yeah killing it's awesome to see man yeah that that stuff's like inspiring i love

[03:42:30]  right you don't use your iphone camera i do but only in an emergency which you carry a special  camera that's look at it yeah fucking camera kid let me see it that's a new one though there's  really no photos on there oh you got a leica yeah this is uh they make top lenses man all the books  and all the photos in my book were taken from a camera from the future what would that be  from the future yeah from the future yeah now that's why i've never been in a martial arts movie  because films are shot at 24 frames per second and i move faster than that so they can't see 
[03:43:00]  they cannot capture you so i found a camera from the future that uh i saw films at a millionth of  a frame a second yes and uh and went back in time and it photographed all these events that i did  that's why everything in the book is real right of course it's pretty amazing that you pulled it off  that you're moving so fast that uh even standing still you were blurry yeah sometimes even when i'm  standing still yeah i can't get in focus it's a very funny picture where judah knocks a whole bunch  of people out and then the next photo he's still in the air and he goes i could have landed but i
