<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with self-deprecating humor, the hosts mocking themselves and their listeners, before discussing their unscripted format and long history.  They then launched into a rant about media inaccuracies and sensationalism, specifically criticizing John Gibson of Fox News for his handling of Patrice O'Neal's allegedly "outrageous" and "filthy" jokes during a guest appearance. This transitioned into a discussion about attractive female news personalities, specifically Jill Nicolini, filled with sexually suggestive comments about her appearance.  The show then delved into a graphic description of a woman who survived "internal decapitation," playing news audio clips alongside darkly humorous commentary.  Other news items covered included a 10-month-old receiving a shotgun license and an ineffective anti-smoking commercial's potential spokesperson replacement.  Before a break, they promoted their sold-out Atlantic City poker tournament and upcoming summer comedy tour, with James Norton sharing a story about damaging his refrigerator in a fit of anger, leading to a discussion about anger management.

The show resumed with a discussion of one host's domestic arguments and strong language, followed by a video of employee Danny playing Dance Dance Revolution.  A video titled "Car vs. Screaming Lady" was then shown, prompting speculation about the woman's motivations.  A caller, Jesse, also offered a guess.  The conversation shifted to listener Deb's new role as a television news talking head and speculation about her donations to "People Against Censorship," followed by a brief discussion of Opie's hockey team curse and underwhelming Boston ticket sales for their comedy tour (contrasted with stronger sales in Long Island and Washington D.C.), including the comedian lineup.  Patrice O'Neal's Fox News appearance and sexually explicit anecdote were again discussed, highlighting the differing standards between radio and television. After a quick mention of lunch plans, the show moved to a news story about increasing HIV and STD rates among 40-50-year-olds, using a woman's story as an example and prompting a debate on the need for a "sex ed refresher course." This segment included a call with Patty, a 52-year-old virgin, who was playfully teased and advised by the hosts. Steve from Bayshore then called in to announce his retirement and a purported suicide.

Further discussion with Patty centered on her plans to attend the Atlantic City poker tournament and transitioned into a news story about older adults needing sex education due to sexual enhancement drugs and online dating.  The hosts employed vulgar analogies to describe the challenges of increased sexual activity.  This was followed by a PalTalk sponsor segment featuring discussions of employee Lisa's negotiation skills.  A caller, Bob, received poker tournament tickets after a humorous exchange.  The hosts discussed their own poker experiences, including a story about a player named Poe, and debated skill versus luck in Texas Hold'em.  A news story about a teacher showing *Brokeback Mountain* to 12-year-olds and the resulting $500,000 lawsuit followed, along with broader reflections on the changing media landscape, the impact of DVRs, the rise of 24-hour news, the nature of reality TV, and the influence of online commentary. Patrice O'Neal's Fox News appearance and the Anna Nicole Smith media coverage were again referenced as examples of media oversaturation.

The show continued with a discussion about the lack of accountability in news reporting, criticizing the overuse of "people are saying" without sourcing, referencing the Fox News documentary "Outfox."  The conversation then moved to Paul Wolfowitz's role at the World Bank and a perceived conflict of interest.  They then discussed changing television humor standards, using *The Honeymooners* and a hypothetical "Cave Dudes" show as examples. A significant portion involved a call with Boathead Jim, who recounted a boating accident that left him in a coma and with lasting effects. The hosts teased him, and listeners were enlisted to give him a ride to the Atlantic City poker tournament.  A BBC interview with a Scientology spokesperson, a news reporter losing their place on a teleprompter, Joe Francis's incarceration and reported crying in jail, and listener calls about a diet plan were also covered, punctuated by celebrity impressions and numerous call-ins.

The final segment began with a confusing discussion about a "Fat Smash" steak diet plan before transitioning to a listener's unconvincing excuses.  A new intern, Jared, was introduced, and the hosts recounted hazing him with Bob Kelly marking his perceived flaws with a Sharpie. Jared's nervous demeanor was compared to various movie characters.  Another young man, possibly another intern, was present, described as more confident. The conversation shifted to Jared's experiences as a mobile DJ at weddings, leading to an improvised bit where he attempted to MC the electric slide, incorporating humorous references to Tone Loc and Young MC.  The hosts continued to banter with Jared, concluding with the announcement of the "line of the day" winner, more banter about Jared's posture, rushed goodbyes, and a final joke about one host's onion-scented crotch.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  If I were to apologize, go away.  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Opie. 
[00:01:00]  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  I don't know about Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  I don't know about Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water-drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  Not palaver. 
[00:02:00]  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  You're about to listen to a comedy show.  Or at least an attempt at comedy.  Comedy.  You're also listening to a show that's 99.9% not scripted.  Even the 1%, I mean the .1%, when is that?  Well, yeah.  That's when we have to like read about the poker tournament or something like that. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, okay.  Or maybe a live read.  You know, something like that.  Because I know we have a lot of new listeners lately.  So I want to educate them about the Opie and Anthony show.  A show that started about, oh, 12 or 13 years ago.  Two guys that decided to just get on the radio and make people laugh.  Or at least try to make people laugh.  Yeah.  Oh, and sometimes they do screw up.  Because we're unscripted.  We're freewheeling. 
[00:03:00]  Freewheeling.  Just trying to make jokes.  Trying to make your day just a little brighter.  Just a little brighter.  Oh.  It's so difficult.  So difficult.  Just to come in here on a daily basis after everything that transpires at night. 
[00:03:30]  And you just want to go off.  You just want to go off.  And right now, like, Elo is shaking.  Don't do it, Anthony.  All I know is...  Don't worry, Elo.  Elo, our boss at XM.  He was in New York yesterday.  Yeah.  And he was going to go to this fine function.  Uh-huh.  Like a jazz function.  He had his talk.  Fuck.  A brand new tux.  And he's hanging with, like, VIPs.  It was, like, a real big deal.  And some issue came up with XM that, believe it or not, has nothing to do with us. 
[00:04:00]  He had to spend the whole night in his tux in his hotel room.  Yeah.  Meeting and phoning.  He wasn't allowed to go.  So he sat there dealing with the latest problem in his brand new tux that he was hoping to use.  I feel bad for him.  It's like he got all dressed up for prom and couldn't go.  Yeah, he flew up from Washington, you know, with a tux, ready to go.  And he did not get to go. 
[00:04:30]  So, yeah, we're at a weird time with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  It's odd because, you know, we like talking about things and there are certain issues.  Well, everybody knows it's been in the news and stuff that we just can't really address like we want to right now because things are sensitive.  Things are sensitive.  Yeah.  So we just got to hang back.  But, my God.  Well, it's funny.  You sit there and watch the news at night and you're like, oh, God, I just want to talk about this.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  That's wrong. 
[00:05:00]  That's wrong.  And that's wrong.  Yeah.  Maybe, you know, we could make some wide strokes here, some broad strokes, as they say, and just talk about some of the inaccuracies that are in the news.  Not necessarily any story in particular.  I'm just talking about in the news.  And you really don't know it until you're part of a story.  But, God, there are so many things that they get wrong because I think the news itself.  They're lazy. 
[00:05:30]  They're getting so lazy.  They're beyond lazy.  That they don't care about a story or its accuracy anymore.  They just care if it's going to be good or people are going to listen or watch.  It's going to be compelling.  It's going to be titillating.  Believe me, they love to titillate on those news shows.  That's why during sweeps they do stories of, you know, teens gone wild at spring break and things like that.  They love it.  And, you know, certain stories hit the news and you know all the facts. 
[00:06:00]  And then you watch the news and go, they're starting to leave out huge chunks because it's not as interesting or it really doesn't put their agenda across if they add in all the facts.  So they leave huge chunks of a story out.  Yeah, because they don't care.  They have no vested interest in the outcome.  And if you're involved in the story, you go, all right, and this has nothing to do, please, this has nothing to do with anyone being right or wrong or who made a mistake or didn't or who's apologizing or not. 
[00:06:30]  Take all that out of the mix.  I'm just talking about the news itself presents stories based on how exciting, how titillating, and how many people will tune in based on what they put out there.  If they add in too many facts, it might whitewash the part of the story that they find compelling, that they think the viewer is going to go, oh, really? 
[00:07:00]  They may water it down too much.  Yeah.  It's not as exciting.  It's not as exciting.  It's not – yeah, it takes away from the part of the story they want to get out there.  And it really is a misrepresentation of what's happening, which is not what the news is supposed to be.  I don't care about that.  The best way to describe the media, Rush Limbaugh said it best.  He calls it drive-by media.  Drive-by media.  They just drive by and just shoot at targets. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, there might be an actual target that they're gunning for, but collateral damage all over the place, and they don't care.  And then they just move on to the next story.  Story.  And they shoot that story down with a nice drive-by.  You know, when you're involved –  Drive-by media.  Bravo to Rush Limbaugh for coming up with that.  When you're involved in a news story and you realize how wrong they get things, you start thinking, what else are they getting wrong that I know nothing about? 
[00:08:00]  Like every other story, unless you're directly involved in a story, you don't know.  But based on past performance, I don't have too much faith in the news and the facts that I'm getting.  And we've been obsessed with the media ever since we screwed up years ago.  Yeah.  And we said to ourselves, you know, when we get back on the radio, and we will, we're going to point all this out to everybody. 
[00:08:30]  And we have been.  We have been for a long time now.  We've been back on radio, what, almost three years.  Yeah.  And then we've spent a portion of that three years really just showing you how ridiculous the media is.  They're just dissecting it, playing their teases, the teases that come up that scare you into watching the news by, you know, putting out some problem that you might have at home.  A product that your children are using could be dangerous.  We'll tell you what it is. 
[00:09:00]  Isn't that just trying to latch on viewers?  Yeah.  Is that what the news is supposed to really be about?  No, it's great, and I'm talking in very general terms.  We've been on the news many, many times since you and I started doing radio together, and there'll be a big story about us.  And they can't even get the name of the show right.  Yeah.  They don't even do enough research to get the name of the show right.  They get the name of the show wrong.  They get the time we're on wrong all the time.  Remember when we were doing afternoon drive radio? 
[00:09:30]  We were constantly called the morning show.  Right.  N-E-W.  And they call us Opie and Andy.  Yeah, Opie and Andy.  They can't even come up with the name of the radio show, and they're about to tell everyone how informed they are on this particular topic or whatever.  It's just amazing.  It's beyond me.  And the past few days watching the news, I've just seen it go from kind of – because at one point, the company's supplying information, and that's fine. 
[00:10:00]  But then at one point, they just started leaving out chunks.  Yeah.  And you sit there and go, well, what about this part of the story and this?  And it's just turned into – I watch, and I get disgusted, and it's frustrating, and you just sit there and want to throw something through your television set.  And I got to tell you, I don't think I'm speaking out of turn, but I think John Gibson from Fox News Channel should be fired. 
[00:10:30]  Simple as that.  He should be fired.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah, he had Patrice O'Neill on yesterday.  Yeah.  And he was just saying beyond outrageous things, beyond outrageous things.  Oh, yeah.  He couldn't control his guests.  He should be fired.  John Gibson should be fired.  That –  Did Patrice actually do the angry pirate joke on TV yesterday?  Patrice O'Neill –  I think we can say that.  Did the angry pirate joke – 
[00:11:00]  On a news channel.  On a news channel.  Completely uncensored.  Completely uncensored.  Well, that's okay.  It's cable news.  Is it?  Mm.  Yeah, they don't have us to see.  They kind of don't.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  But Gibson should be fired.  He couldn't control his guests.  It was probably one of the dirtiest things I ever said on the Fox News channel. 
[00:11:30]  The fans went nuts.  Oh, my God.  The message boards went nuts.  People like – did that just happen on the Fox News channel?  Patrice lost his mind.  I think that clip is going to be up on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  It's up on our fan sites.  Just amazing.  Yeah.  Amazing stuff from Patrice last night.  Patrice is a guy who just doesn't care.  He will say whatever he wants, and God bless him.  He got on there and just – because I guess as a comic, you really have nothing to lose. 
[00:12:00]  No one could – no one could really fire you from being a comic, can they?  Nope.  Maybe – I don't know.  For now.  Michael Richards wasn't really a comic.  Was a good comic, not.  Not a good comic or anything.  He's like an actor turned comic or comic turned actor turned comic.  And he got caught out doing something that really isn't comic-like.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just brutal.  Right, right.  But someone like Patrice who really is – you've seen Patrice's act. 
[00:12:30]  He's hysterically funny.  They have him on these news shows because he's funny and he's so out there and in your face.  He doesn't care about offending.  He doesn't care about anything.  So he gets on there and just speaks from his soul and speaks what he believes in and uncensored completely just went off and told some of the filthiest stuff I've ever heard on the news.  Unbelievable.  Did the now lady like him? 
[00:13:00]  Strangely enough, I think she did in some way, shape, or form.  Like Patrice just looked over and said, you know, he could just tell by looking at her she has nothing to do with funny.  Like he just looks at her with that look.  Yeah.  Well, keep it at that.  I mean, it was an amazing TV appearance.  And like I said, you know, John Gibson should be fired for not controlling his guilt.  Yeah, well, that's what I think.  By the way, so we're sitting in the office getting ready for today's show.  And Ann said, wow, this hour goes by really fast now. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, the 5 to 6 o'clock hour.  Used to take a long time.  Would take forever.  But now it goes by like a blink of an eye.  And at one point I just finally had to admit to all the guys like, ah, I used to spend this time prepping for the Opie and Anthony show.  But now I'm just looking at hot broads on the internet.  Now it's just, I go, I go, Ann, check out.  Come here, come here.  Look at this.  And I'm thinking it's some story that we're going to do or something.  And I walk over by the computer and Opie's just got, who was on there? 
[00:14:00]  Today it was Jessica Alba.  Jessica Alba.  On a beach.  Sprawled out on a beach.  I'm like, yeah, oh, wow.  Doing some photo shoot with just a t-shirt on and a bikini bottom.  That's nice.  I'm like, maybe that's what we could do with this show.  And then we just gawk over the traffic girl.  Like we used to listen to the news stories that they're doing.  The traffic girls, Jill Nicolini.  Jill Nicolini.  She used to do the in-house, like, I don't know, announcing at NASA Coliseum at the Island 
[00:14:30]  Games.  And then they put her in the, they wasted her for a while and in the helicopter doing traffic.  This is how stupid, we're going to go local.  And there's a, there's a radio company we work for.  When we go local, they get so mad because they're like, well, our station in Maine doesn't  know what you're talking about.  Really?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  I'm like, are you crazy?  The listeners can like fill in the blanks and figure it out.  Hot chick on TV.  She does traffic.  She shows off her, uh, her, her assets and fine clothes.  Lovely.  She had a nice, like kind of hippie, uh, type of, uh, like outfit on today. 
[00:15:00]  Flowing sleeves, very low cut.  With big jewelry that hangs down nice and low.  Accentuating.  There you go.  Right.  Assets.  So Jill, she's a, she's a very, very nice girl from Long Island.  She loves her Long Island roots.  And she started at the National Coliseum and she would give away the silly prizes when,  you know, there was a stoppage of play and she would do like in between periods stuff  on the ice, you know.  But, um, the freaking fans loved her except for the women that went with the guys to the 
[00:15:30]  game because.  Oh, you'd gawk over her.  She would walk through this place.  Remember Ozzy yesterday?  Yeah.  With the smell of Ozzy?  Well.  The smell of Ozzy.  You could smell Jill coming from like, she'd be in the next section.  You could smell that she's on her way.  Like she had a ridiculous smell.  Jesus.  Sounds like a bunch of hyenas waiting for her.  Oh, I'm not even kidding.  And she would walk through the National Coliseum to get to a section to give away a dumb pizza  some, some, some garbage.  And she was very, very talented.  And, and, you know, she's obviously on TV now and that's where she belongs. 
[00:16:00]  But she started, you know, this is when I recognized her and she would walk by these  sections.  I've said this before.  And every guy would just turn their eyes and just stare at this girl.  She walked by.  There she is.  There she is right now.  Oh my God.  There she is.  All right.  Now it's chilly in the studio.  Yeah.  It wasn't before, but now it is.  And I think those are smaller, by the way, because she ended.  She ended up in Playboy's.  There are, there are naked pictures of that girl.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  You just look her up on Google.  But I think she got them smaller because they, they used to be really larger.  Maybe she's like packed in and she would have the perfect outfits at the Nassau Coliseum  as she's walking through the crowd.  Every guy just like turning all the way around to watch her walk by.  And the women would just sit there with their arms folded in the, in the, in the Coliseum,  just angry at the guys.  No, just angry at how hot she is.  So now she's on TV and she does the traffic.  She, she, she does some light lifting right now. 
[00:17:00]  I think they really want her to be a star.  Yeah.  They're really pushing her.  She used to be in the helicopter, which was the worst thing.  You couldn't see any of her.  You could just like see a little bit of her and she'd be up in the copter talking about  traffic.  Now they have her in front of a big, you know, green screen and she's pointing out where  the traffic problem spots are.  And this is what I want to bring up.  Uh, the dopes at chat 11 here in New York city, she does the traffic.  You got this really hot girl.  They show her for two seconds and then they go to the traffic map and it's just mundane,  dumb, who cares? 
[00:17:30]  Little animated cars that are either green, yellow, or red, depending on where the traffic  jams are.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  And then traffic.  I'm so distracted.  Who put this up?  Thank God.  Oh, it's Danny.  Put, turn on that screen and you can see her naked there.  Uh, I guess they weren't able to get all the, uh, the pictures of her off the web yet.  Uh, are they trying?  I would think they'd want that car.  Yeah, that's her.  Wow.  Okay.  She's wearing a little, uh, Jesus. 
[00:18:00]  Are those even boy shorts she's wearing?  They're cut up to like.  These pictures are, uh, are a bit old now.  Way up our hips.  Yeah.  This, oh, that was the style one.  And she was taking the pictures.  That's nice.  Um, I don't care if style or not.  Yeah.  So just to bring it home.  So she's on for two seconds looking really hot.  Then they go to the traffic map with these weird, like green things like Ann said that  shows traffic flow and it's red if it's not flowing.  And then they'll just show video of some highway somewhere that you don't even know.  Just with cars on it. 
[00:18:30]  I'm like, channel 11, you got this hot piece of, you know what, show her the whole time.  I'd have her floating around on the green screen.  Just have her in front of the traffic all the time.  Yes.  Take advantage of her on your, on your news channel.  And then they go back to her to finish it up and it's another quick two seconds.  And then they're off to the anchor desk where the, uh, the, the woman behind the desk is  just beyond pissed that she has, has to be in the same studio as, uh, this girl.  Yeah, they, uh, they, they, they know what sells too. 
[00:19:00]  They know.  What do you, why do you think she's out of the copter and in front of a little thing doing  the traffic dressed in little outfits like that?  Come on.  Well, cause people want to look at her.  Stop with your holier than thou attitude news.  No, I mean, you know, most of these women that are on TV, they're, they're going to look  at simple as that.  Exactly.  And that's why they're there.  Every news girl that is a very attractive, very hot, uh, is known. 
[00:19:30]  You know, their names, you know, the channel they're on, you know, everything.  You have a woman that really does a good job at reporting the news, but might not be as,  uh, uh, good, nice on the eyes.  No one knows their names.  No one really.  Rita Crosby.  She was pretty good.  I'm Rita Crosby.  And oh my God, I can't talk.  I'm down here in the Bahamas and, uh, talking about the Anacol Smith situate.  She couldn't speak.  I think they finally got rid of her cause the last polyp dropped or whatever it was in 
[00:20:00]  her freaking throat.  Polyp flew out of her mouth and hit the camera lens.  But so there are exceptions.  I mean, Rita Crosby wasn't going to look at it and her voice was just beyond ridiculous.  It was, it was so uncomfortable to watch at home.  Rita Crosby.  Our next guest making his way to the studio is my ears, nose, nose, throat man.  He's going to try to tell me why it sounded like.  I sounded like this because I had internal decapitation.  My skull actually slipped off the spine. 
[00:20:30]  It's an awful thing, but I have a TV show now, so I don't care.  She hasn't talked in short spurts to get it all out before the voice just drops to nothing.  Rita Crosby.  Rita Crosby.  President Bush is happy.  Today we're going to be talking about the way.  What, Rita?  What are you talking about?  I said the way President Bush is happy.  Huh? 
[00:21:00]  What?  Subtitles.  What?  Breaking news about President Bush?  What?  Breaking news.  Oh my God, this is so important.  Things that have taken into turn.  It's not the word.  Why, Rita?  Rita?  You don't understand what you're saying.  All right, we're just getting started.  By the way, for the newer listeners, as we try to educate you about the Opie and Anthony  show, we just made up that 20 minutes, and we ended with Rita Crosby.  No scripts.  Had no clue we were going there.  Hopefully, that was a safe break.  You never know. 
[00:21:30]  You never know.  They've heard someone.  I don't know.  It's the nature of the beast.  We don't know.  We don't know.  Is that break safe?  Who knows?  That's the chance you take when you're freewheeling and trying to make people laugh and trying  to entertain people as they go to work.  Strange, strange world we're living in these days.  Oh, another picture.  Thank you, Danny.  There you go, Danny.  Just keep those flashing.  We'll have a fine show.  Danny, star of a Dance Dance Revolution video that is sweeping YouTube. 
[00:22:00]  What is it?  Oh, God.  We got to talk about that.  All right.  We'll talk about it after the break.  It's just...  I haven't seen it yet, so why don't we take a look at it?  Oh, punch it up.  He is a star.  All right.  You douche.  And by the way, if you want to play in the ONA Poker Tournament, a chance to win a spot  in the tournament.  From what I hear, packed out.  Sold out.  Nice.  Yes.  Our fans are very, very into that.  Well, we'll get into all the details in a bit. 
[00:22:30]  Also, how are the cities doing as far as the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour goes?  We'll have your countdown in just a bit.  We like to do this like once a week.

Got an email and went out to everybody on the ONA show.  Sold out!  Yep.  That's what our listeners do.  They support our sponsors.  It's going to be a packed event. 
[00:24:00]  Can't wait.  Well, we said it a while ago.  I mean, this show is kind of like a lifestyle.  People are getting married because of this show.  They're having kids because of this show.  They hang out on weekends because of this show.  They get naked with each other because of this show on Pal Talk.  They're on message boards.  Yep.  It really, really has become a lifestyle.  Start their own organizations.  Yeah.  End up on CNN.  Oh, man.  That was nice.  Wonderful.  Lay down in bed now because she's all tired and sleepy from her appearances on television yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  PeopleAgainstCensorship.com, right?  Yeah.  Devin sent me a link.  It's a YouTube video of it, I think.  It wouldn't open up.  I wanted to see it, but I didn't see it.  Oh, you've got to see it.  It's very eloquent.  She's very articulate, and it was just a wonderful job she did on CNN.  Can I say something about HTG, by the way?  Huge support of the Opie and Anthony show.  When she doesn't have that thing in her hair, that thing that she's known for, what is it, a band?  What is it?  A thing?  An arrow?  No, that hair thing. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, a big ****.  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought that was the thing you were talking about.  When she takes that thing out and lets her hair float out, even hotter, HTG, even hotter.  Oh, too ****?  No.  No?  It's some kind of hair thing.  I don't know.  Oh.  I don't know what the hell it's called.  You know, it's like a half circle type thing.  Oh, you're talking about ****.  No! 
[00:25:30]  No?  I barely recognized her on TV last night because she didn't have that thing in her hair.  Oh, I know what you mean.  What?  ****.  No.  No?  No?  Oh, maybe you're talking about ****.  No?  No.  By the way, for everyone...  See, because we have to explain the Open Athletic show as we go on.  Anthony's actually not saying anything.  No.  He's just hitting a beep and then adding a consonant at the end.  Watch.  I could talk right over the beep if I wanted to.  See, we've got to educate everybody. 
[00:26:00]  Silly.  I know.  But anyway, just a little fashion advice for HTG.  Yeah.  It's very hot, but when she lets her hair down, I didn't even recognize her on TV.  I'm like, wow, look at that.  It was like the Adam Ant Goody Two Shoes video.  Huh?  The girl takes her hair down.  Oh, okay.  That's what it was like.  Yet she kept it classy with some classic pearls.  Yes, she certainly did. 
[00:26:30]  But anyway, so our fans, you know, if we throw a comedy tour together, they're there.  They just don't go to the show.  They do the tailgating, and it's just an all-day event because our listeners like hanging out  with each other for the most part.  It's huge.  Well-behaved.  Yes.  And they spend a lot of money.  They do.  Anyway, so we threw this poker tournament together for Atlantic City this weekend,  and like Anne said before the break, sold out.  Sold out.  Going to be a great time.  Also hearing all kinds of things, posts on message boards and stuff,  that after the tournament, people that get knocked out are going to get together 
[00:27:00]  and have their own games.  I will absolutely be part of that, too, because here's my deal.  Because I work for the company, Opie, and I have no problem with this.  My winnings, if I win, we'll go to charity.  You know.  But I do plan on fleecing some of the listeners after the tournament.  We're all going to get a few tables together and get some side games going.  You're going to continue.  Yeah.  So that's going to go probably all night.  So it's going to be a great time. 
[00:27:30]  We have to be at the VIP party, though.  Yeah.  Remember what happened at the last VIP party that took place in a casino?  I looked around.  I went, nice.  Where's the tables?  Goodbye.  And I'm heading out.  But hanging with the listeners, of course.  We're going to be hanging out and playing some cards.  Well, they're going to be all over the place.  You can still go down to Atlantic City and join the party, even though we have a few tickets  to give away to the tournament.  One pair courtesy of paltalk.com.  The only place to see our show live from the studio.  What else is going on? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Club Worship.  That's where we're going to be partying after the tournament.  And that's going to be Saturday night at 10 o'clock.  Club Worship in the House of Blues down there in Atlantic City.  For all details on the tournament, go to onapoker.com.  But there you go.  That's what the fans do.  They sold it out.  We thought we'd have to push all week.  No.  But it's already sold out.  Done deal.  Can't wait.  Which is very, very cool.  We refer to this with the Rita Crosby bit that we attempted. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know if it worked.  I don't know if it offended anyone.  But we did it.  And we talked about internal decapitation.  We played this yesterday.  We got to play this again.  We have to play this over here.  One of the most horrific stories, I think, of the year so far.  I think.  Brian Regan has a bit where he talks about the worst pain you could ever have.  And he says...  The broken femur.  Femur.  He says the worst thing that could happen to you is breaking your femur.  I guess supposedly that's the worst pain.  It's the biggest bone, I think.  Yeah.  If you snap that in half, that's probably the most pain you could ever feel. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I think we got to pass this on to Brian Regan so he updates his little bit.  He does on the femur bone.  That...  I don't know if it hurts that much because your head is kind of separated.  Are you feeling anything?  I think that is a high heebie-jeebie factor.  You know, when you ever get the heebie-jeebies from something, you just go...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is...  Oh, my God.  Her head is off of her spine. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe people don't want to hear this today.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Is it going to creep...  It creeped us out yesterday.  It's pretty creepy.  Should we save it?  I thought because, you know, she was alive and in one of those halo things where they  bolt your head to your shoulders pretty much.  Yeah.  I thought she was okay.  But apparently a lot of damage was done when her head was just sliding around and it  affected her voice and everything and her eyes.  So she's pretty screwed up and she can't talk.  But, yeah, she did sound a little like Rita Crosby, I guess, if you want to take that 
[00:30:00]  tack.  Man, maybe we should do everyone a favor and not play this.  Why?  That was great.  This?  Yeah.  People are, like, going to work.  Just a piece.  And they're trying to eat.  Just an example because now everyone's curiosity's peaked.  You think?  Just a piece.  Don't even have to play the whole thing.  Well, what you're about to hear is a woman that survived internal decapitation.  Yeah.  Her head pretty much was separated from her body.  The only reason it didn't roll away was because the skin was still attached.  Got the skin, some, you know, veins. 
[00:30:30]  Maybe some.  Spinal cord.  Maybe some cartilage or something.  All kinds of goodies that keep your...  I feel my own neck from time to time.  I'm like, what is all this stuff?  A lot of junk in there.  What is all this stuff?  You know, when your head is the command center and you got this whole body flapping around  and all that crap has to run through your thin neck to make everything work, there's  a lot going on in there.  It's kind of like here.  We're broadcasting and then there's all wires everywhere.  Yeah.  And then you kind of follow the wires and all of a sudden there's a hole in the wall and  there's just a ton of wires going into that hole. 
[00:31:00]  That's your neck.  That's your neck, basically.  That's your neck.  You breathe through your head.  Yeah.  And it goes down into your body.  So all that stuff's got to be in there, piping.  And then you got your nerves.  So that's like the electrical system.  By the way, to the new listeners, we're freewheeling right now.  And we're attempting to make the neck seem funny.  Isn't the neck hysterical?  Only when it's the only thing holding your skull on.  True.  That's a hoot.  True.  By the way, no scripts in front of me.  We're going to just see where this goes. 
[00:31:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Look for the next script.  That's right, Opie.  The neck has lots of stuff in it, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's up all night writing this stuff.  No scripts on this show.  The neck's hysterical.  The neck's hilarious.  So anyway, car accident, internal decapitation, head flops to the side.  It's pretty much not attached to the body anymore except for the skin and all this other stuff.  And then it's like sliding around. 
[00:32:00]  And all I picture is her doing one of those Egyptian meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,  where the head can go kind of side to side like that.  Yeah.  And it just gives me the heebie-jeebies because she said it was sliding forward, backwards,  and side to side.  Hey.  By the way, I didn't get today's new rules.  Like, are you allowed to go make that noise when you're talking about Egyptians, or is  that offending someone?  I have no idea.  Oh.  I really have no idea.  You know, I didn't even think of that.  See, that could be the next thing that gets us in trouble.  I have no idea.  Well, maybe not a good idea is to bring up what might. 
[00:32:30]  Maybe we can leave that to other people.  Well, you never know.  That's, that's, yeah, whatever.  Just doing the walk like an Egyptian dance.  For another day.  Here's a woman survives internal decapitation.  She was in a car crash, separated her skull from her spine.  I remember the impact, and then I had no control over my head.  In a matter of seconds, 30-year-old Shannon Malloy's life changed. 
[00:33:00]  A car crash, January 25th, on a Nebraska road, dealt such a powerful blow that her head dislocated  from her spine.  The clinical term for her condition, internal decapitation.  I wasn't focused so much on the pain.  I just kept thinking, I have to stay alive.  Dr. Gary Giselli says Shannon's will to live is what saved her.  I've seen it once before, and the patient unfortunately didn't make it.  Five screws drilled into Shannon's neck, and four more in her head, keep her stabilized. 
[00:33:30]  It's called a halo, and prevents her skull from shifting.  Not exactly an easy or pain-free procedure.  So, so, so now they're waiting for what?  Is that the bone to grow back?  Yeah, I guess it's not.  Like a broken arm?  It has to mend, it knits itself.  Knit.  And she's been wearing giant square Yankee hats.  Oh, that stupid halo.  My brother.  I had a ShopRite hat.  My brother had a halo.  What a nightmare.  ShopRite. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  I can hang Christmas decorations from her.  Gosh.  I like how they say it's her will to live.  So she kept her surviving, because like everyone that's died,  wanted to.  You know, it's like, it's just her will to live that kept her.  I think everybody that's sitting there on their last breath is pretty much gone.  I kind of want to live.  Well, not that.  But you think that will to live thing is a...  It's completely true.  It's a big thing.  But it'll bum everyone out. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  If you ever watched a person die, people, here come the last.  Body does some amazing things in the last moments to try to stay alive.  Just trying to make it funny.  Thank you.  Yeah?  Like what?  If you've ever been in a hospital room watching someone die,  it's just beyond amazing what the body will do in its final moments. 
[00:35:00]  Jesus.  Oh, you asked.  That's horrid.  Will to live is nice, but throw yourself off a building and will yourself to live.  Yeah.  I really want to be okay.  You're going to be okay.  So, yeah, so the spine is now attempting to mend itself back to the head?  I think it's the top of their last vertebrae, whatever that piece is called,  and the skull itself.  Like it's snapped out like a coconut, 
[00:35:30]  like a little piece coming out of the end of a coconut,  and then you put it back in, and that's got to seal up.  And no paralysis for this woman?  Your spine can't, like, there's nothing there that's going to mend.  If her spine, like, ripped apart, then she'd have a huge problem.  Well, yeah, picture the wires again, I guess,  so those wires didn't, like, separate or whatever.  Yeah, I guess she didn't, I don't know,  it didn't say if she was paralyzed or not, but I'm gathering she's not.  Yeah, I'm thinking not because probably the spine wasn't ripped up  and all the stuff attaching, it was there. 
[00:36:00]  All the tendons and the voice box probably what held her on.  Her, like, learnings.  You want to hear more?  No, that's why she sounds like that.  It's because her voice box got all screwed up.  I tried to breathe when I listened to her,  because, like, she sounds like she's fighting for breath.  Yeah, that's what I'm like.  I'm trying to breathe when she's doing it.  It's really awful.  Speaking of voice box guy, there's a little controversy we didn't get to yesterday.  You know the guy that's shown here in New York?  Yes.  Oh, the anti-smoking commercial guy?  Yeah, the Hispanic gentleman with the hole in his throat. 
[00:36:30]  The buzz kill.  I used to enjoy swimming, but now I can't swim because I have a hole in my throat and will drown.  It's like, oh, that's horrible.  They were hinting yesterday in the paper that they might need a new spokesperson  because people aren't getting their quit-smoking kits because of the commercial anymore.  Like, when that guy first appeared on TV, and let's be honest, creeped a lot of us out,  it also was doing its job.  A lot of people were getting the quit-smoking kits.  Why aren't they getting him now? 
[00:37:00]  The quit-smoking kits are way, way down.  People are used to him, that's why.  They see him.  Maybe we can get that article from yesterday.  I like this guy.  I like to smoke with him.  He's like the Verizon guy.  He's just used to see him.  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  He's not shocking anymore?  No.  What are they going to have to get?  Somebody with a lung hanging out this side?  They might have to take another approach because they noticed that that is way down from a year earlier.  We'll get the story.  We'll get into it.  Do you want more of this woman?  No.  Internal decapitation?  Is that it?  I'd say a bit more.  A bit more?  My skull slipped off of my neck. 
[00:37:30]  Just in case you didn't hear that, she said my skull slipped off of my neck.  I feel like I'm getting a stiff neck listening to this.  And this is exactly why I can't watch shows like ER.  Because I start feeling things that people have.  Yeah.  I don't like this.  I'm taking Benny Hill music to try to cheer everybody up.  Do you think that would make it sound better?  I don't know.  You got any Benny Hill music there, Dan?  Give it a whirl. 
[00:38:00]  All right, hit it, Danny.  My skull slipped off of my neck.  It's not as bad.  About five times.  Every time you take a screw.  This is my head.  That made rebuilding Shannon's next drink a priority.  But there were other complications.  Doctors are working on that. 
[00:38:30]  But today, her skull has healed.  She's well enough to have her halo removed.  Is that Chris Hansen?  He's doing now the freak show stories?  Well, sounds like it.  Sounds like Chris Hansen.  Why don't you take a seat?  Why don't you take a seat and tell us what happened?  Prop your head up and have some lemonade.  Right.  You were here for snacks. 
[00:39:00]  Chris Hansen, Dateline and B-Sign.  You know, we were talking about the media to start the show, right?  Yeah.  Why?  Someone answered this question.  Why is that on TV?  Why?  I guess it's news because people mostly die from it.  It's a freak show.  It's something that you've never heard of before.  So they have to show everybody.  They're not getting anything accomplished by showing you that story.  That's apparently what Dale Earnhardt died from also.  His head being killed? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  He said that's when he hit the wall.  That's what happened to him.  And this woman survived it.  That's what I hear.  I'm starting to realize that your skull sitting on the top of your spine is not as strong as you would like to think.  Well, the good Lord had his plan, I guess, with us as far as still slapping us together.  But the engineering is pretty poor.  You know, we're pretty frail.  When you could take a bug and you could just throw him out a window and he can plummet and hit the ground and just walk away. 
[00:40:00]  We're a little too fragile.  I blame computers.  Why?  It's evolution happening.  You think we're just getting weaker?  Yeah.  You know how they're saying, what, we're losing, like, our pinkies or our little toe or something?  They are?  Yeah.  They come up with all sorts of stuff like that.  Who's they?  You know, people.  People are saying.  Oh, okay.  People are saying?  Like, the Neanderthal man was, like, bulky.  Yeah.  And his neck? 
[00:40:30]  He had muscles everywhere.  Like a football player.  You couldn't break that neck.  But now we're all sitting in front of our computers just IMing and checking Google to see if our names appear.  You know, stuff like that.  You don't need the strong neck anymore.  So our pinky disappears, but we get this huge, like, pointer finger for clicking.  For pointing and clicking.  Oh, yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  But another generation or so, you're going to have, like, you know how they goof and show you that big green thumb?  Yeah.  That's going to be your index finger from computer use.  You ever use your computer so much that your pinky nail gets worn flat a little on one side from sliding on the table on the mouse pad? 
[00:41:00]  No.  Yeah.  Get outside, man.  Just a little bit.  From gaming, though.  That's all gaming.  Believe me.  It's gaming injury.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it'll happen to you.  A little counter strike.  I haven't gotten an injury, like, on my right arm, my right hand, the top of the thumb, and right pointer finger from hitting the underside of the desk.  Oh.  Repeatedly?  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  And we learned this woman has a GI Joe in her stomach or something like that.  I swear I heard it.  And like we said yesterday, usually I like to hear every single word of these things to just be informed and help the story.  Oh, normally, yeah.  I'm just picking a word or two.  I can't focus too much on this.  It's creeping me out.  Normally, we would have rewound and tried to find out exactly what she said because, obviously, she does not have a GI Joe in her stomach.  Right.  Regardless of what medical procedures were done, this is very new.  Like they said, it's only like the second person they know that had this and the first to survive. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know everything that goes along with the surgery.  Yeah.  But I do know, I can assure you, and I'm not a doctor.  Trust me.  There is no GI Joe in her stomach.  All right.  But I heard it.  You want to hear the final clip before the break?  Okay.  Here it is, Shannon.  Shannon's mom, Robin Frazee, is amazed.  That is definitely Chris Hansen, by the way.  Is it?  I guess he's running out of people to bust.  He's got to go into the freak shows now.  This is a freak show story.  It's on TV so we can gawk at it.  Shannon's mom, Robin Frazee, is amazed that her daughter has survived this ordeal and has recovered as well as she has. 
[00:42:30]  Robin remembers the first few days in the hospital and calls them touch and go.  One doctor continued to tell the family to prepare for the worst.  It was just really scary because he just kept saying, we've never, ever seen this injury in a person that's alive, and you need to say your goodbyes now.  Well, goodbye won't be happening anytime soon.  Oh, my God.  It's a miracle.  Oh, it's an absolute miracle.  It's a miracle that she was able to survive from the actual accident. 
[00:43:00]  Survive.  That she's made the progress that she's made.  Doctors will continue to work on Shannon's swallowing and vision.  She says removing the halo was a big step for her, making her feel like a full recovery is in sight.  Oh, yeah, there'll be a great one.  I would ideally like three before I recover it.  No, that's not going to be a great possibility.  I get coming really close, so.  I would just be petrified that they remove the halo. 
[00:43:30]  I would be petrified.  Oh, yeah, like crack.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, they screw that right to your skull.  No 80s reunion concerts for her, though.  You can't just see her back in her head.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  There you go.  There's your uncomfortable story of the morning.  Yeah.  I think her husband gets mad when they argue and just grabs the little halo cage and shakes it until she pays attention. 
[00:44:00]  You could really kind of pull her right close to you.  Hey, you.  Hold on to the sides just to make your point.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're losing Jimmy Friday.  You're going to Nashville, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, this Thursday afternoon, I'm doing stuff.  What the hell do you think you're doing? 
[00:44:30]  I miss our southern friend.  Oh, okay.  Where are you?  Nashville, Tennessee.  Zaney's in Nashville.  What is it?  Zaney's in Nashville.  Oh, Zaney's, okay.  It's got to be good if it's Zaney's.  Yeah.  That's not bad.  The name itself.  It just implies Tomfoolery.  Right, Tomfoolery.  Isn't that club down the street?  Tomfoolery's?  There was a place called Tomfoolery's when I was in Kansas City.  Oof.  By the improv, me and Kenny would walk by it every night.  It was called Tomfoolery's.  No, it wasn't.  Oh, God. 
[00:45:00]  What a horrible name.  How bad did Kenny want to go in there?  It's Tomfoolery's.  Can I speak to Tom?  May I speak with Monsieur Foolery?  It was just so stupid.  A bunch of white guys, you know, just engaging in a little after-work shenanigans.  And Tomfoolery.  Hey, um.  Over some Harvey Wallbangers.  Yeah, we were supposed to go down to Philly Friday and broadcast live from WISP.  I don't know if that's happening with all the craziness that's around us right now. 
[00:45:30]  I don't think so.  But Atlantic City definitely at the Showboat Hotel and Casino.  We'll be there all weekend long with a bunch of our pests playing some poker.  And then that starts the road trip, pretty much.  Yep.  We're not taking the summer off.  We're going to be doing our comedy show all summer long and visiting some of the cities  we broadcast into.  It's going to be a very, very busy summer.  The big comedy tour.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Anyway, hey, 10-month-old gets a shotgun license.  Oh, good. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah?  Or is that what a, oh, okay, a shotgun license?  You need a license for a shotgun?  I don't know.  It was pretty funny, though.  Well, we'll play the story and then we'll get into it.  Well, you're never too young to own a gun in Illinois.  One toddler has a brand-new shotgun and a license to go with it.  Now, this is 10-month-old Howard Ludwig, nicknamed Bubba.  He has his own state-issued firearm owner. 
[00:46:30]  His dad completed the online form for him.  Yeah.  Did the news guys say, who thunk it?  Yeah.  Meaning that the kid's nickname was Bubba?  And said, who'd have thunk it?  I think that would offend some Bubbas out there.  He could.  That is kind of a stereotyping thing, I do believe.  Yeah, you've got to be careful, man.  Watch out.  I'm sure there are some fine Bubbas out there.  Of course.  Arm owner's ID card.  His dad completed the online form for him.  Yeah, the plastic card has a picture of Bubba giving a toothless grin. 
[00:47:00]  His grandfather has already bought him a Bubba.  And he's doing the accent, too.  That definitely would piss off some Bubbas out there.  I bet you there's some Bubbas that work on Wall Street.  Sure.  Good luck finding them.  Why not?  Good luck finding them.  Better chance finding a Floyd.  I guess we're safe, and we could say that because we're white, right?  Well, Bubba's a white thing.  As long as we don't do the accent.  Yeah, yeah.  The plastic card has a picture of Bubba giving a toothless grin. 
[00:47:30]  His grandfather has already bought him a brand-new Beretta.  State police say there's no age restriction on gun ownership.  Oh, you know what?  This is going to start.  You know what?  This is going to start.  The record is a 10-month-old, so someone out there is going to go,  well, I got a 3-month-old, and he needs a firearm or a shotgun.  Yeah, start the contest.  Right.  Well, I don't think he's going to be using it for a while, huh?  Babies with shotguns.  That seems dangerous. 
[00:48:00]  Just babies crawling around.  Give shotguns to babies.  Yes, we advocate it here.  It would make a hell of a reality show.  Babies with shotguns.  That just seems silly.  Like there's no age restriction?  I guess.  Was that an oversight?  Maybe in the rules?  I don't know.  The signature on the permit or whatever it is, the license, is just kind of like a squiggly line. 
[00:48:30]  It was like a little squiggly, like they held his little hand.  An up and down line.  Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.  Just scribbled on it.  Across the form.  I know a lot of kids, though, especially shotguns, they get into trap or skeet shooting at a very young age,  like five years old.  And that's fine.  But you don't have to.  I think this guy was trying to make, you know, make the news, make a little statement.  I think he was trying to make his friends laugh.  Make his friends laugh.  Hey, look at my kid.  Well, we're all trying to be like stars.  It's the YouTube generation, basically. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  So everyone's out there making their videos and coming up with their little thing that'll get them on the news.  Yep.  And this guy figured it out.  I'll get my 10-month-old a shotgun.  Godspeed.  Jimmy, your hand looks well.  Have fun.  I'm okay with the right hand.  Yeah.  A little bit.  I see you going like this a lot, like, ah.  Like, making sure I didn't, I think I might have cracked something.  Yeah.  Barroom brawls.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Heckler.  My refrigerator got smart, so I punched it, because it was either that or go to jail for hitting another person who was in the house. 
[00:49:30]  Did you hit your refrigerator?  Yeah, pretty hard.  That's not smart.  We were arguing, and, um.  You in the refrigerator?  Yes.  I said, I want things colder.  It said, they're cold enough.  I got ugly from there.  And, um, I was biting my phone.  I'd bite my cell phone.  You were biting your cell phone.  Yeah.  And then you punched it.  You know, the Coalition for Appliances and Electronic Devices are going to come after you. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  If you keep biting your phone and punching your fridge.  I was so angry.  See, I used to, I used to punch, uh, walls and stuff, and, uh.  Dumbest thing you can do.  Yeah.  You realize they don't move.  The wall doesn't give.  You will lose.  Whatsoever.  Every time.  Every single time.  The wall won't even care.  I think I got, like, arthritis in my right hand from punching walls so many times, and then  finally I just woke up one day and said, you know what?  That hurts, and it's stupid.  I'm not doing it again.  I'm not doing that anymore, but I had to come up with something else, because the weird thing 
[00:50:30]  about punching a wall when you're really frustrated, it makes you feel much better, but then you  got the pain in your hand.  Yeah, and then you feel like an idiot.  You're kind of like, ah.  But whatever, like, whatever tension you're feeling and you do that, it goes away.  So now that I personally decided I can't punch walls anymore, I can't.  My hand is just not going to, you know, survive it.  I came up with biting, attempting to bite my left index, uh, middle knuckle off when I  get mad. 
[00:51:00]  I will go like this and bite as hard as I can.  And then if I'm really mad, no, not like that, like this.  No, I was just remembering, you just gave me this memory.  My mother used to bite her finger, but she would put her hand flat and then bite her pointer  finger like, ah, ah, like she's all mad.  Oh, you sons of bitches, ah.  But it's weary.  Maybe she was.  Whatever frustration you're feeling, it goes away when you do that.  But then I do another one where, ah, I bite in between my bicep and my shoulder. 
[00:51:30]  There's a little skin here that's kind of just loosey-goosey.  No real muscle there.  I'll go like this and bite as hard as I can.  Why?  Leaving teeth marks in between my bicep and my shoulder.  But it makes me feel better, and it's much better than punching a wall.  Jimmy, I didn't punch a wall.  Punched his fridge.  I mean, well, wall, fridge.  Well, drywall, you want to punch on a hole.  Either break your hand on a stud or punch a hole through drywall. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, but that's a gamble you don't want to take.  If you look at your fridge in the right light, do you see little knuckle marks?  No, it's a big, like, one of those sub-zero type things.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I pull back.  Stainless steel, good.  That's a good one to hit.  It is.  I pull back a little bit.  I just...  Oh, you pulled your punch?  I hit the bag, so my knuckles are okay.  But I'm sore now.  The right part of my thing is really, ah...  Yep.  That doesn't go away for a long time.  My pinky knuckle from punching a wall once when I was a kid, I was mad at something, 
[00:52:30]  and I punched the wall, and my pinky knuckle's still not recovered.  That really hurts.  So now, if I ever get the urge to, like, punch something or get really pissed like that,  take two seconds and just go, do you really want to do this?  Like, even though you're irrationally mad, you've got to get this rationality.  It's got to slip in for just two seconds.  Do you go, do I really want to do this?  And usually, no.  The answer is no.  Oh, by the way, I got deep teeth marks around my index knuckle. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, last night?  And deep, bruising teeth marks in between my bicep and shoulder.  Yeah, well, believe me, I was taking a lot of two seconds last night, too.  Don't...  No?  Do you want to...  No?  Do you want to buy another television?  Do you want to buy another television?  You've got to talk to yourself sometimes.  All I ask is, how about you show some responsibility?  Jimmy Norton?  Yes, baby.  So, everything all right?  Care to share? 
[00:53:30]  Was it about anything?  Just a stupid argument.  Well, that's all I ever hear about you and your girl whenever you argue.  It's something very stupid.  Let's just say this.  There are certain things that I say that are not directed to her at all.  That bugger.  That are just not at her vocabulary.  That you just blurt out?  In moments of anger.  Oh.  But not at her?  No, no, no.  I wasn't mad at her at all.  But she doesn't like those words?  Certain things, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, boy.  And sometimes you've got to...  Like, the dilemma is, like, well, do I...  I know there's certain things she doesn't like,  but it's like when you're ranting about something and you're angry,  it's like people sometimes have to just let you do it  when you're not directed at them.  It's like, why would the language bother you?  And then she's like, well, you know I don't like that.  Why would you do it when you know I'm right here?  Here's a clip of Jimmy.  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  Wow.  I did tell her to shut up.  She was very irritated.  Oh.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  I actually told her, don't open my window.  I was so mad. 
[00:54:30]  Don't open my window?  I was so mad.  She went to open the window, and I'm like, close that window.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  I couldn't think of anything else.  That's like something a crotchety old man says to his wife  he's been married to for 50 years because he's got nothing else.  Close that window.  I showed her.  I was so angry.  It was almost like, look, I'm in my house, okay?  And I mean, I don't mean like you're in my house, kid,  but I mean, this is where I live.  This is my private sanctuary.  If I'm ranting about something, and I'm not attacking you, 
[00:55:00]  I wasn't even being a dick to her because I wasn't mad at her.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to let me just do that here.  I don't want language police.  It's kind of, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So I couldn't, I didn't know what else to do.  So she went to open the window, and I just went, close that.  And she's like, what?  I'm like, I don't want that window open in my house.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, you tool.  Oh, she closed it, Bub.  Bub.  She's going to close it.  All right.  Hey, were you commenting on somebody else? 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  And you probably used a word, does it start with the letter A?  Letter B?  No.  Letter C?  Nope.  Really?  The A word, the B word, the C word, the D word, the E word, the F word.  The G word?  No, it's a combination of a few, but under the same thing.  Oh, you were making up curses?  That's always fun.  Ant's brilliant at that.  He could string along a bunch of different curses.  I let him fly.  You didn't know they could flow, so we'll let him fly. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Listen, let's move on.  We got Car vs. Screaming Lady.  This video is amazing.  Speaking of the YouTube generation, Danny, you know what's going on in this clip, or is it Sam?  Big Sam.  Where's Sam?  We're Than, you know?  No, Sam does, though.  Danny's just all caught up in one video these days, and it's his Dance Dance Revolution video  you can see on YouTube.  What keyword do you have to put in?  Douche.  Dance Dance Danny.  Dance Dance Danny?  Or Dance Dance Revolution Danny. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Dance Dance Danny.  Dance Dance Revolution Danny.  And just prepare yourself.  Sit back and take it in.  I guess this happened after the Jim Norton show at Caroline's?  Yeah.  We went to see Jimmy on Saturday.  And after Caroline's, we went to a place in Times Square called Dave & Buster's.  Where you can drink and play games.  Yeah.  There's some Dave & Buster's all over the place.  Oh, and one of the highlights of Dave & Buster's seems to be the Dance Dance Revolution machine.  And there he goes. 
[00:57:00]  There it is.  Look at those arms.  I'm watching the video now, and everyone is doing the Danny around the office.  Everyone's dancing and doing the Danny.  It's a big hit.  It's the latest craze.  It is.  It's sweeping the nation.  How hammered were you?  You were gone.  No, I wasn't bad.  Drink, drink revolution.  He was on first.  That's what he did first.  Did you think you were dancing well?  No.  Did you think you were dancing well?  Look at him.  He's into it.  He got his arms into it is what's the best thing. 
[00:57:30]  He puts his arms kind of up over his head a little and shakes them back and forth.  And there's the Foundry logo because everything has to be tagged with a Foundry logo, even if the person from Foundry didn't film it.  You know, it's been, I think, the 70th anniversary of the Hindenburg, and I watched the video, and the Foundry logo was on the bottom corner.  I take credit for the Hindenburg video.  I was there.  He has the copyright for that video.  Yes.  It's a Bruder film.  Same thing.  The Dance Revolution should end the same way the Bud Dwyer film eggs. 
[00:58:00]  Nice lunch baggie and a laugh.  Here we go.  Crazy Screaming New Jersey Woman versus a Car.  What is this about, Sam?  Yeah, well, I guess the video is on.  It has a big flaming F at the end of it, so it's another one of Steve's.  It's very.  It starts with a woman laying on the street behind a car that looks like it was just backing out of a driveway.  And this woman is laying stretched out and screaming at the top of her lungs as people try to help her. 
[00:58:30]  That's what the first clip is.  Just a woman.  Oh, so you don't want to give anything away yet?  I don't even know anything.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  All right, hang in there, because this gets really good.  So that's what this starts with.  Yes.  Here it is.  By the way, we're laughing because we know the outcome of this video.  I don't, and I still think it's a clue. 
[00:59:00]  It's hysterical.  It sounds like Eastside Dave from Ron and Fez.  Well, we've got to educate the new listeners.  See, we're laughing in this case because we know the outcome.  Really?  Yes.  I really don't.  I don't either.  Really?  Oh.  We're discussing it in the office.  Wow.  A set of pipes. 
[00:59:30]  I'm scared to do anything.  That's a good, pick it up.  Yeah, we call the police.  Something.  This lady is awesome.  Yeah.  That is what I heard the entire time my girlfriend was talking.  That sound, that shrill sound.  Was that it?  Oh.  And then the window opened, and you got angry.  Close that window. 
[01:00:00]  It's me.  I'll catch my duck.  Wow.  That sounds, now that sounds very horrific.  Yeah, that's going to make me laugh all day.  She's screaming.  She's behind a car, and people are coming over to help her.  And I heard, we called the police.  They're on their way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she continues to, you know.  I thought, oh, well, wait.  What, did she break something?  Well, it sounds like Patrice.  She's laying, and he's laughing. 
[01:00:30]  It does.  It does.  And she's laying on her back.  She's flat on her back, like stretched out across the full lane.  Laying her back.  Laying her back.  Oh, it's.  Oh, God.  Oh.  I'm going to get it.  I'm scared to do anything.  They're trying to figure out what to do.  Like, let's move her out of the way.  And she's like, I'm scared to do anything.  Have a touch, an accident victim. 
[01:01:00]  That's a good, pick it up.  Yeah, we called the police.  Something.  Oh, something.  Yeah.  Oh, something.  And you can't see her face at all, because she's wearing some kind of head wrap.  Yeah.  And so her face is covered by, it looks like a white sheet.  She seems to be in distress.  Yeah, very much.  And she's behind this car.  Yeah, looking like the car backed into her.  So her feet are almost under the bottom there.  In a driveway.  It looks like it just came out of a driveway. 
[01:01:30]  So it's in the street.  So she's blocking the whole street now.  Oh, she's in the street.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, here's a little bit more of it.  All right.  It's funny to say that, because we got Jesse on the line.  Jesse, what do you got for the Opie and Anthony show?  I wanted to take a guess at the sound.  I was pretty confused.  I actually thought that was E-Rock after he gets off the scale.  I think that's the scale yet screaming.  That's terrible. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sorry.  Well, I can't imagine what the hook is in this whole thing.  Well, you're going to find out after the break.  Oh.  Yeah.  It gets much better.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:02:30]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  We're just talking on the break about making donations to people against censorship.  I don't know what to do.  I'm confused.  You go to the site, peopleagainstcensorship.org.  Oh, .org.  Or .com.  Or .com.  Okay.  Either one.  And you'll see a donate button. 
[01:03:00]  And I guess that keeps Deb on TV.  Yeah.  Keeps Deb on TV.  She's becoming a talking head.  I joined last night.  Made a little contribution to the cause.  And I feel good about myself.  I'm going to donate $25.  Wow.  Dollar rubies.  $25.  Dollars.  You see her on PalTalk the next day in a fur coat.  Yeah, right. 
[01:03:30]  She's all bedazzled in jewelry.  Yeah, we have no idea if we could even trust her.  What did she do with our money?  I had to buy new pearls for another appearance on the news.  You guys understand how to look good on TV.  Nobody wants to hear about censorship from someone not in a Mercedes.  It's amazing what happens with this show.  Already accusing her of graft.  Isn't that great?  One of our listeners is now a talking head. 
[01:04:00]  How did that happen?  Embezzlement.  Right.  All right.  I know.  It's like she goes from PalTalk, and then I turn on CNN, and there she is.  It's like, how the hell did that happen?  She's pretty much saying, screw PalTalk.  I got real TV now.  She has to bring a bed to CNN and sit under the comfort.  It's the only way she can be photographed.  Yeah.  Hey, on the instant feedback.  Folding her laundry.  On the instant feedback, hey, Ope, how about them Sabres? 
[01:04:30]  Eh?  I'm a little surprised you have not talked hockey lately.  Well, a lot of people know about my sports curse.  And when my Islanders were knocked out, I said, I want the Sabres to win it all.  And the faithful listeners in the Buffalo area said, Ope, shut your mouth.  Really?  We don't want your sports curse wrecking our Sabres' chances at winning the cup.  So I've kept silent on purpose.  And see? 
[01:05:00]  Well, they're down.  Yeah.  But some people say they're down because I mentioned that.  It doesn't matter.  Well, that's just it.  It doesn't matter what Ope does after the fact.  Once he endorses a team to win, it's a sure loser.  All right.  Back to the screaming lady.  People sat through the break.  We appreciate that.  So we got Screaming Lady.  It's a video that Sam found.  And it's just terrific.  Once again, here's Screaming Lady.  And we'll get a little deeper into the story. 
[01:05:30]  I'm scared to do anything.  That's good.  Pick it up.  There you go. 
[01:06:00]  A lot of people are saying it sounds a lot like this scream.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's better.  All right.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, or that.  All right.  Let's find out what Screaming Lady is all about.  I can't watch this video anymore.  The 91-year-old World War II vet.  Yeah.  All getting punched.  And they're asking, why didn't the bystanders help?  And I, like yesterday when we talked about this poor old guy that was getting carjacked  and punched, what, 21 times or something like that? 
[01:07:00]  There's another video clip of this that they're not showing a lot.  It's more of a far shot.  And you see a bunch of people just mingling about.  The next car over.  Oh, look at that poor old guy.  He's walking arm in arm with his best gal.  Here's the long shot.  Look.  These people are just mingling about.  Look.  There it is.  Do they see what's going on?  I know the one guy's not even facing it.  He's facing away.  How can you not see what's going on?  I just don't know.  Are you that self- 
[01:07:30]  I don't know.  Are you absorbed?  Oh, it's just disgusting.  Well, this guy's, did they catch the guy who did it?  I think they arrested him.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, they got him.  Oh, here's the other.  Now they're showing all clips of beatings.  This one guy was denied, I guess, a beverage.  And decided he didn't like the bartender.  Yeah.  So it just starts beating the hell out of her.  And no one helps.  No, look at the guy in the corner.  I think he was on the cell phone.  I think one reason people don't help is because you don't know if the guy has a pistol or not. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  You know something?  Oh, here he is.  There he is, just walking after his beating.  Just trying to take a walk.  He's a World War II veteran.  Poor old cadre.  He's all beat up.  Oh, God.  Is he a black guy or a white guy?  Hmm, looks like he's a black guy.  Yeah, black guy.  That's how you know you're old when people can't make a racial determination.  Aw.  All right, anyway.  Back to Screaming Lady.  So we find out what this Screaming Lady is all about right here. 
[01:08:30]  This next clip, Sam?  Yeah, some of the witnesses are talking about it.  All right, here's the witnesses explaining what this lady is up to.  I saw exactly what she did.  Can you stay?  Because I don't want to get arrested for hitting her.  You didn't hit her.  Well, I know that, but she's going to say that I did.  She did not hit her.  You did not hit her.  She threw herself on the back of my car.  Yeah, she sure did.  And then she threw herself on the ground.  And I tried to help her up, but then she just started screaming.  So this lady's insane.  Yes, she's crazy.  She's insane. 
[01:09:00]  Or she's trying to get some cash.  And who is videotaping this?  I don't know.  The only person you can really see is the lady on the ground.  It's either the woman whose car it was possibly videoing or one of the witnesses.  Supposedly, she threw herself on the back of the car, fell on the ground, and just started screaming like she was hit by the car or something, right?  Yeah.  You know what E-Rock used to do before Danny took over his post?  Put the video up on there so we could all see it.  But E-Rock's too busy looking at Jessica Biel.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I mean, Danny. 
[01:09:30]  Danny is.  Yeah.  He's one of the celebrity hunks.  He's just seeing what the count is on the viewings of his Dance Dance Revolution video.  All right.  More to the screaming lady here.  Crazy woman gets up and starts talking to the police.  Now she's getting up.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  That's the video?  How do people find this?  I know you could go to our website.  Yeah.  Crazy woman in New Jersey throws herself onto car, lays in streets, screaming.  That's your search right there. 
[01:10:00]  Thank you, Steve.  Crazy woman in New Jersey throws herself onto car, lays in streets, screaming.  That's how you'll find the video on one of our websites.  It should be in the daily headlines.  What's over her face?  That's that scarf or something she was wearing.  What's the scarf again?  Yeah, it's some kind of head wrap.  Head wrap?  Okay.  So she's on her back with her arms stretched out, her legs pretty much stretched out, and  she's just wobbling her head back and forth as she screamed.  Right.  Yeah, the video's like five minutes long. 
[01:10:30]  And then for a while, they're just looking at her, and she's just laying on the ground.  She doesn't scream unless somebody tries to help her.  Otherwise, she's just silent, laying on the ground.  It's got to be a lot of energy, screaming like that.  So we don't know if this car, because the car is in the middle of the road, was pulling  out anyway, and she just happened to see an opportunity and kind of jumped on the back  of it or something, the witnesses are saying.  That seems to be it.  Well, we later find out that her house is right there.  Okay.  So she could have seen the car pulling out of the driveway and just run down the stairs 
[01:11:00]  and jumped on the back of it.  Oh, my God.  She's crazy.  What a loony.  Don't you hate her?  Well, she gets up finally.  This video's really long, but she gets up finally and talks to the police.  Okay, there's no problem.  Oh, you know, you're more than welcome.  Okay, that was desperate.  That's her.  All right.  You're better?  Yeah, I'm all better.  Want to dance?  No, you live here.  What do you want?  You live here?  Go ask my father.  He said, I don't know how many you can say.  Get out of it.  What?  What language do you want me to speak? 
[01:11:30]  I want to know.  Hello, Hamidin.  You live here?  Yes.  Okay.  But would you give me the choice?  Are you not enough to give me the choice where I can go live?  To choose my place?  That's not my decision.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Wow, she's crazy.  You should hear a...  Wow.  Yeah, the cop goes to try to help her up, you know, and she just hops right up, and she's 
[01:12:00]  saying, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, I think she saw that, you know, the heat was on.  Yeah.  She's walking towards her house.  That's why they're asking her, is that your house?  And she's in...  Oh, okay.  She's got some kind of head wrap.  Oh, she's in some kind of a ceremonial head gear.  And now she's up, dancing, like clapping her hands, like, all right, well, and now she's  trying to walk back to her house.  Like it's some kind of performance art piece she was doing?  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  But now she explains why she did this. 
[01:12:30]  Here it is.  You want to say, I'll say it.  Okay, bye-bye.  Thank you very much.  You've done your job a long time ago.  Okay.  I can't.  I don't mind.  We don't have a burger.  We want to stay?  I want to know why you threw yourself in the back of my car and held up all the traffic.  Would you like to go to the hospital?  You want me to do it again?  I'll do it over and over and over.  Why?  I'd love to.  Why?  It's my job.  Just baby?  It's my job? 
[01:13:00]  She's a car jumper?  She jumps on the back of cars?  And then she walks up her stairs and goes in her house.  Yeah, that's it.  How do you get that job?  Do you have to apply for that job?  Wow.  What a lunatic.  I hope she moves out of trains.  Thanks.  I thought that was a total bomb.  Oh, another crash.  Jimmy's joke is screaming on the ground.  It's whimpering.  It's going murmur. 
[01:13:30]  Well, there you have it.  Yeah.  Okay, so she was either trying to pull a fast one or she's crazy.  Ah, she's crazy.  You decide.  She's absolutely crazy.  I don't even think she wanted money or anything.  I think she's just crazy.  Attention.  Just crazy.  She doesn't even know why she's doing it.  All right, there you have it on that one.  Just reading the text on the towel talk. 
[01:14:00]  Most things.  Can't even say them.  They're sensitive people.  All right.  Moving right along.  Choo-choo.  Is it cold in here?  I don't know.  Ice cold.  I'm feeling nippy.  Jimmy, I was hoping that you had something a little better than that.  No, I thought it was separate.  A lot of silence, and I'm like, oh, Jimmy's about to speak. 
[01:14:30]  Is it cold in here?  Ah, it's cold.  Ah, cold.  I'm just catching a bit of a chill.  No, I'm actually, like, heating up.  Ooh.  Been heating up for a few days now.  All right.  All right.  Moving on.  ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Coming to a city near you in the very near future.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com.  We've been doing this once a week.  It's kind of fun.  We pit the cities against each other, and we get ticket counts for all the cities. 
[01:15:00]  And I got the latest counts.  Doing very well, by the way.  And we see who's doing better than the others.  Yeah.  We have seven dates so far.  Yep.  In last place out of all seven cities.  It's a real shocker.  But Boston, Mansfield.  Oh, my God.  July 21st.  As far as the seven dates we got for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour,  Boston is in last place. 
[01:15:30]  They were in last place the last time we did this.  And then they surpassed Detroit, and now Detroit's beating them again.  And people don't even know us in Detroit.  They're still getting used to the Opie and Anthony show in Detroit.  Yeah.  Boston, we have a long history.  And for some reason, ticket sales are a bit slower than the other cities.  Why is that?  I have no idea, man.  I have no idea.  It's very, very disappointing so far.  But it's July 21st. 
[01:16:00]  Mansfield, for all you Boston folk, the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Seven or eight comedians you know and love from the show.  The tailgate in the ONA Village.  It's an all-day experience.  I know what it is.  It's going to be a great, great day.  What?  Because my birthday is July 19th, and then Boston is throwing me a big party,  and they've all bought tickets for that probably.  It's a surprise party.  That's right.  Tickets for $300.  Well, you demand good gifts.  Yes.  So it was like, should I go to the tour or get Jimmy something really fancy? 
[01:16:30]  It's at a TGI Friday.  So Detroit in seventh place, once again, in sixth place, Detroit.  Oh.  And to tell you the truth, not expecting much from Detroit, because like I said,  we're just, we're new.  Yeah.  We're new to Detroit.  Just getting things going up there.  They're in sixth place doing just slightly better than Boston at this point.  There's actually like a 50-ticket difference between Boston and Detroit. 
[01:17:00]  And then in fifth place, it's the casino up there.  Mohegan Sun.  Mohegan Sun.  Yeah.  Is in fifth place doing very, very well.  That's a small venue, too.  That's going to sell out.  It's only 7,000 tickets, I believe.  And something like 2,000 are comps.  The casinos and their comps.  Oh, that's so people can, they could give the high rollers.  The high rollers just, they can't even sell those tickets.  They're already sold.  And they just hand them out to people that have no clue. 
[01:17:30]  I get so frustrated when we do casino shows because of that very fact.  Remember what happened to you?  Oh, the Borgata.  I almost dropped an F-bomb.  I just, in casual conversation.  The F-bomb, I just, like, what are you?  This is radio.  I did the Borgata on New Year's Eve, and I'm going to be adamant from now on.  There will be no, especially, I never got my merchandise money so far from the Hard Rock.  They have not paid me for my merch.  I will not have comps because the casinos buy up comps, and you get credit for those tickets as a performer. 
[01:18:00]  But then they just give them out to high rollers.  You'll have 25, 30 open seats in the front row.  Yeah, because most people are just playing cards outside.  They're not at the show.  Or they just aren't a fan of that particular act that's playing.  So they're like, ah, I don't need my comp tickets tonight.  I'll just keep them in my back pocket.  And then you got the performer on stage.  In this case, Jimmy, I was there.  And there's 20 or 30, like Jimmy just said, empty seats, dead center.  And the rest of the place is packed with O&A fans.  Every casino has that, every show. 
[01:18:30]  They just hold on to the hosts just in case a guy needs them.  That's it.  So they pay for them.  But I'm going to make a rule of something.  I don't want any comps, 20 rows in.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't care how much he makes.  Or once the show starts, you fill those seats, or I'm going to fill them from the back.  Yeah, you just move everyone forward.  Yeah, absolutely.  So Mohegan Sun is selling very well.  It's going to sell out.  It's a small venue.  Like I said, 7,000, I believe.  And only like 5,000 tickets are up for grabs or something like that. 
[01:19:00]  Maybe a little more than that.  2,000 comps.  2,000 for our show.  That's fifth place.  Fourth place, Camden, New Jersey.  Yes.  Philly a little behind right now.  And that was the big get last year.  That was the show to be at.  That was the show to be at at the ONH Living Virus Commentator last year.  So they're in fourth place right now as far as overall ticket sales go.  And then this is pretty, pretty cool. 
[01:19:30]  Detroit.  Not Detroit.  Sorry.  Wait a minute.  Wow, they just sold a bunch of tickets.  The Washington, D.C. area is in third place, beating out Philly right now.  They're very excited for this tour down there in the Washington, D.C. area.  Psyched.  And we're in the middle of a great lineup on WJFK.  Our show is like in middays or something.  Like it's a really bad time slot.  And we're still selling very well in the Washington, D.C. area.  Good enough for third place.  And then, of course, second is Jersey.  We're huge in Jersey. 
[01:20:00]  Homedal is doing very well.  And number one, Ant and I from Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  Jones Beach is still in the top slot and running away with it at this point.  Nice.  So there you go.  Good.  There's the countdown of the cities as we pit them against each other.  Tickets, of course, available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on our website so you can see which comedians are going to be at the show you want to go to.  And don't forget about the village and the tailgate and everything else.  Yeah, it's huge. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Have a good time.  And we haven't confirmed Rogan for any more dates.  What are we doing?  Ask Pete.  I don't know.  I know we confirmed Stephen Lynch for a bunch of dates.  Yeah.  Good.  And that's going to be very exciting.  Louis Black, Frank Caliendo, Carlsman.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Bob Kelly.  Patrice O'Neill, who probably got someone fired yesterday.  He is an ass.  Of course the guy will get fired, you know.  But he should be able to control his guests on TV.  Patrice just said things that have never been said on the Fox News channel last night. 
[01:21:00]  I know that what he said would get you thrown off of the radio.  It has gotten radio guys thrown off the radio.  It's that whole thing that's been out for a few years now.  We actually got away with it back in the day.  And then Jack started getting fired for it.  On the internet, there's those lists of these weird, twisted sexual practices that go by  these wacky names.  Don't even say the names.  I'm not going to say the names now.  I guarantee they'll dump out. 
[01:21:30]  I'm a pro.  Most people have seen the list.  Yeah.  You've seen the list.  And there are names to these things.  The names alone are funny sounding.  And the descriptions are always crude, rude descriptions of these practices.  And you used to be able to get away with it saying them on the air if you were tricky in the way you put it.  But Patrice, last night on Fox News, just went on and uncensored told one of these sexual practices. 
[01:22:00]  Got massive laughs.  Oh, got laughs from the cameraman.  And it was horrific.  Yep.  Some people would think horrific anyway.  But he was cracking up the people in the studio.  And it was the first time I'd ever seen that said on television.  Shouldn't the host be fired now because he couldn't control his guest?  Perhaps.  Ah, nothing will happen though, right?  We'll see how it goes.  He's a news show.  Well, there's different standards.  We're the scum of the earth.  Radio is the scum of the earth. 
[01:22:30]  Can I say one thing?  Poor, poor radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The chili dog.  Yeah.  It's all.  Oh, okay.  You're hungry.  Yes, I am.  Because I am too.  Oh, wow.  But that's unhealthy.  And probably too fatty, right?  Yep, definitely.  It's not good.  The chili dog would be a fantastic lunch though.  All right.  A little too heavy though.  You have it.  All right.  I'm going for the chicken.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Anyway, moving right along.  There was something I was going to say, but now I forgot.  Did you?  Yeah, it just left my mind.  All right.  We'll take a break and regroup.

Thanks for the support, by the way.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Got a couple interesting stories in the news here.  We got to talk about grandma in a little bit here. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, the grandma story.  Tragic.  Well, they're saying, people are saying, experts are saying, that 40 to 50 year olds need sex ed  refresher course.  40 to 50 year olds?  Yeah, we'll get into that in a few minutes.  Why would they need a sex ed refresher course?  Oh, they got a doozy of an example.  But does that really mean that all 40 to 50 year olds need a refresher course? 
[01:24:30]  Well, we like to just generalize in society nowadays.  Oh, please.  So I guess, yeah, every single 40 to 50 year old needs a refresher course in sex ed.  What, do you want to do this real fast?  And then we'll move into...  Why not?  All right, we started down this road, so...  Well, we'll find out why.  The older people need a refresher course. 
[01:25:00]  Does it really mean they need a refresher course?  God.  I need the story.  Here we go.  Hold on to your hats, people.  What?  Maybe we should do this bit in a comedy club because then we'll be completely safe. 
[01:25:30]  Hopefully.  For now, you're safe in a comedy club.  Think of sex ed.  We normally think of high school.  You don't think of adults in their 40s and 50s.  But, you know what?  Without a refresher course of sorts, they could, in fact, be putting themselves in terrible danger.  CBS News' Kirsten Cole explains why.  At nearly 50, Jane Fowler reluctantly hit the dating scene after her divorce.  She had a few sexual partners and thought she knew them all well. 
[01:26:00]  I knew that I couldn't become pregnant, and so using protection of some kind, i.e. a condom, didn't enter my mind.  Fowler is a mother, a grandmother, and now an HIV-positive divorcee.  So she finally decides to go out, have a little fun, decides she can't get pregnant. 
[01:26:30]  She's like, ah, what's the worst thing that can happen to me?  Get pregnant?  Well, no.  I've passed that stage of my life.  So let's go have some fun.  Yeah.  Would she pick these guys up out in front of the methadone clinic?  Yeah, right?  Who's she dating?  I thought she was older.  She's only 49 or 50.  She should know better.  And that's ridiculous, the whole thing of people needing a refresher course.  She was just stupid.  She's stupid. 
[01:27:00]  Because who doesn't know?  How old was she when Rock Hudson made that big appearance where he had AIDS and pretty much brought it to the forefront?  What was that, 80?  85.  A little over 20 years ago.  So 20 years ago.  So how old was she?  She was late 20s.  Yeah, 25.  So shut up.  A refresher course.  She was stupid.  And now they're going to say that because she does this that everyone needs a refresher course?  I got to jump in, though.  What?  Yes, Jimmy.  Rock Hudson.  Back then it was gay disease. 
[01:27:30]  Back in 85.  But again, when she heard that, she might have thought that that's all gay guys got.  I'm saying it's not so far, so long ago or so recently.  That someone between 40 and 50 needs a refresher course on AIDS and sex education.  Jesus Christ.  Who doesn't know that if you have sex with a stranger without a condom that there's a chance you could get AIDS?  She knew it.  She probably didn't realize that the guy she was hooking up with had a gay lifestyle. 
[01:28:00]  No, she probably assumed she probably wouldn't get it.  But do you think that maybe in her head is thinking I might get at least some kind of sexually transmitted disease?  I think she had no clue.  She didn't use – she said she didn't use a condom because she didn't have to worry about getting pregnant.  This 40-whatever-year-old woman doesn't know that condoms –  Pushing 50.  Pushing 50.  Doesn't know that condoms are also used to help against sexually transmitted diseases.  Probably a few of the guys around the neighborhood thought she knew them well.  Maybe saw them at church or the supermarket. 
[01:28:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  There is not one person that doesn't know.  Stop it.  Maybe one person.  The screaming woman behind the car.  She doesn't know.  Gonorrhea?  I'm saying there's other diseases.  Like if it wasn't age, she could have still –  Well, that's the next clip.  I blame the Viagra.  What?  Wait to hear this stat.  Wait to hear this one.  I gave little thought, no thought, to STDs.  It was a routine blood test that revealed she had HIV. 
[01:29:00]  She was shocked, but Sue learned she's far from alone.  It's increasing at a faster rate among older people than younger people, especially women.  In 2005, the CDC estimates that people in their 40s were contracting HIV at twice the rate of people in their 20s.  What's more, those who are 40-plus are facing other diseases as well.  Since the late 90s, the incidence of acute hepatitis B has increased dramatically among those age 40 and older, 
[01:29:30]  much more so than what you see with 20- and 30-year-olds.  Because they never wear bags at that age.  They never.  No, because for them growing up, occasionally you get the clap.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We've kind of – I mean, I'm –  I need a shot, doc.  I've got the clap.  Which was bad.  But it's like with AIDS awareness, like the whole thing, like all through high school, it was like AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  It's like, all right, I can't.  I got to wear something.  Or girls make you.  Or you switch to other ways of feeling good as opposed to, you know, where you're really going to get something. 
[01:30:00]  So I think that's why a lot of younger people don't get it, just because a lot of girls won't let you.  Is that it?  Yeah, I mean, please, if I was left to my own devices and no one ever told me I had to wear protection, I would have been dead years ago.  Yeah.  Years ago the way I acted.  But what would it make you?  Well, it is very difficult for a guy to initiate the protection portion of a sexual encounter.  It's one of those things.  And as a guy, you know, you know it.  You know it.  It's one of those things where you get very caught up in the moment and you just go, you know something? 
[01:30:30]  Ah, throw caution to the wind.  And you would have to have the girl speak up and say, hey, I'm not doing this without some kind of protection.  Then you got to play it off like you were just like, what are you doing?  Like you aren't trying to without.  No, no.  I'm just measuring distance.  Oh, no, no.  Just making sure everything works for next time when I do have protection.  We got an expert on the line.  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty. 
[01:31:00]  What does she know?  Patty.  Good morning.  Wait.  Hi.  Stalker Patty?  Yep, Patty.  Yep, Patty.  I'm not an expert, but I lost the statistic I heard.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did you lose her accent?  Travis.  Different Patty.  What?  I couldn't hear you.  No, see, what makes this very interesting, we have a Stalker Patty that's like, you know, one of our people.  And she's a 52-year-old virgin.  We thought she was calling in as an expert on this topic, but it's another Stalker Patty? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, it's not Stalker Patty.  No, no, not her.  She almost sounds like her a little.  Well, that's what Travis is saying.  What happened?  What happened?  It sounds like her.  What happened, our little Travis?  It sounds like her.  And she said, Patty.  And I said, Stalker Patty?  And she goes, yeah.  Oh, neat.  Start the mix-up.  So I read for the mix-up.  There is a little.  I can't totally punch Travis in the face over this one.  I can't kick him in the groin. 
[01:32:00]  How about your fridge?  Could you hit that?  Yeah.  Punch the fridge.  Don't open a window.  We're kind of disappointed because Stalker Patty calling in as an expert on this would be just terrific radio.  Yeah, of course it would.  But instead we got Patty.  All right.  What do you know, Patty?  Just that I heard that the people that are getting AIDS now are the population between 40 and 60 because they are stupid.  That sounds like Patty.  What do you mean they're stupid?  And how do you know this?  I don't know.  Oprah told you?  What happened?  I read somewhere.  Yeah, I read it too. 
[01:32:30]  Here's a little stat.  Here's a little thing that they pull those stat things on you.  They say the fastest growing population of people contracting AIDS are the elderly.  Now, if you have 10 old people with AIDS last year and this year you have 20, that's 100% increase.  So, of course, as percents go, you would say that's the fastest growing.  And it sounds amazing when you go, they've had a 100% increase in AIDS amongst those people that age. 
[01:33:00]  If you have people in their 30s and 1 million of them had AIDS last year and, like, 1.5 million have AIDS this year, then you'd say a 50% increase.  And it's still half a million more.  Can you slow down, Professor?  No, I'm just hoping I get my percents right.  And when do we get the pop quiz?  At the end of the show there will be a quiz.  Don't go away.  Hey.  Very good.  I think that woman was not alone. 
[01:33:30]  A lot of people at that age, they just can't get it.  Do you know from personal experience or something?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Not you personally.  I assume you're on the younger side, but maybe you know someone that's older.  I don't know.  You know what?  Also, people in their 40s through 60s were kind of very sexually active when AIDS was kind of underground still, you know, before everybody knew about it.  So who knows?  They could have contracted it back then.  A lot of people live with it for years, and then you come out with it, or you're having sex with people in your 40s, pops out at 50. 
[01:34:00]  You don't know where the hell it came from.  Well, let's go to the real stalker, Patty.  Thank you, Patty.  All right.  I'm talking like I know what I'm talking about.  Older people do get it at twice the rate.  But in Canada, it's actually a quarter of the rate than it is here in the United States.  I just watch the eyes now.  You've got to watch Jimmy's eyes. 
[01:34:30]  But does it sound good, though?  It sounds good.  If I close my eyes, yes, but I look right into your eyes, I know you're full of it.  Why?  Because they're open wide, and I'm begging to.  Don't give me away.  Hey, what's the rate of nurses in geriatric homes?  Those creeps.  Oh, yeah, that's how they get it.  Yeah, that's how they get it.  First person to get it while she's sleeping.  With a pillow over her face.  Let's go to stalker Patty.  What's up?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  What's up?  Nothing much.  I just got a phone call.  Oh, see, she does kind of sound like Patty. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, see, this is our stalker Patty.  So, Patty, you know anything about this subject?  Well, yeah.  No, you don't.  No, common sense.  You have no sense.  Common sense.  How old are you now, Patty?  I am 52 in about three weeks.  52 in three weeks, and you're still a virgin.  Yeah, because I have a little common sense.  I'm not going to die.  Oh, my God.  She is so petrified.  I'm 103. 
[01:35:30]  I wanted to hear from other virgins.  Starter Patty is, for her 50th, I think we were trying to get her some action.  Yeah.  She turned us down for the last time, and now we're like, you know what?  You're hopeless.  Forget it.  We're trying to get you some action, and you refuse to do it.  You're now going to be 52, still a virgin.  Patty, is it that because you're scared of a disease?  Is that it?  Oh, I'm afraid of a few things.  I just don't want anything to happen to me, and I wanted to be with somebody that I actually know  and actually have a relationship with. 
[01:36:00]  You've been saying that for years.  You're 52 years old.  Who are you going to meet?  Where is this knight in shining armor that is going to come riding up and whisk you off  of your hammer-toed feet and make love to you?  Well, no.  I mean, I'm not in that other extreme either.  It's just that I don't really meet these feet.  I haven't really met anybody to connect with, you know.  Yeah, because you're a bore. 
[01:36:30]  I'll tell you why.  I was at FH Riley's holding down the fort this weekend.  Yep.  And a bunch of people that did some nice things for us, you know, over the weekend,  they came by to kind of hang out.  So I threw my credit card down and said, hey, buy everyone a drink or whatever, you know,  keep the card open for a little while.  And everyone's walking by with some nice, you know, beers and whatever.  And then Patty walks by to thank me for buying her coffee.  I got a coffee.  It's a Saturday night, and you're a 52-year-old virgin drinking coffee at a bar. 
[01:37:00]  A little wine at the VIP club.  A little wine.  You just had a little wine in the phone.  Now, let me, and I don't want to insult the people that are in the program, by the way.  Patty's, Patty, I don't think ever really drank is the point I'm getting at.  Patty, you ever really get drunk?  No, and I don't want to.  I've seen her drunk.  I've seen her drunk once. 
[01:37:30]  Condition and stuff like that.  I don't want to put myself at risk.  At risk for what?  I've never drank in my life.  Why do you, Patty, why do you want to extend your life?  Your life stinks.  52 Patty years.  I'll take two Aussie weeks over 52 Patty years.  You know, I just don't know how dangerous it is for me, personally.  So I don't want to.  And I've never drank in my life, either.  What about a guy to have a relationship with? 
[01:38:00]  Like, you're not even on the on-ramp yet.  Yeah.  I would love it.  It would be nice.  All right.  What are you doing to try to, like, find this guy?  Are you dating?  You're not dating, obviously.  But are you, I don't know, going somewhere where you might run into a fine gentleman?  Um, well, okay.  Um, last year, you know.  Last year?  In the blue moon, I visited the Claridge, you know. 
[01:38:30]  And I met a guy last year, but I got a little bit afraid when he wanted to call me.  So now we just say hello when I, you know, when I see him, like, every few months or so.  Every few.  You're living your life like the life expectancy of people is a thousand years old.  Right.  Like, she's like, well, I had a date last year.  Patty's like a preteen.  Patty's living like a tortoise.  She's a tween.  She is.  Well, what I was going to do, the next time I go there again, go up to him and ask if he'll have dinner with me or something. 
[01:39:00]  Wait, does he work down there?  Does he work down there?  He works there at the desk there.  He's the one that gives the comps on the bus, and we talk occasionally.  He says hello to me.  I say hi to him.  So does he give you a...  I've been interested last year, but I kind of blew it when he actually called me, and I got a little bit nervous, and he sensed it.  Wait, what did you do when he called you?  Yeah, what did he do when he called you?  What did you do when he called?  He sensed fear. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, I just said hi.  He says, you know, whatever.  And I just don't remember exactly.  It was a year ago.  But lately, you know, we've been...  You know, we've said hello a lot, you know.  Said hello a lot.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  You're a minor bird.  I'm going to go right to him next time and say, why don't you come have, like, a dinner with me or something.  Oh, God, how awkward would that be?  You know, I'm busy.  You've got to walk up to him and give him an oopsie or something. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, give him a little slip.  You've got to make a strong move now.  Do a Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  When you get out of the bus, the jitney.  Right.  When you get out of that bus, pull a Paris Hilton and just kind of stay seated.  Put your legs out and let him maybe catch a view of some things.  Or maybe we can just give him some video links to some of the horrors things you've done in the studio.  Yes, that's true.  Hey, Patty, you want us to send him a couple of emails of you with a Krusty the Clown mask on? 
[01:40:30]  No, that might loosen things up.  Yeah, what does he look like, this guy?  Yeah, describe his looks.  Movie star.  Okay, he's about 20 years younger than me.  Uh-oh.  So he's 40.  You know, about 35 years old.  Okay.  He's Hispanic, I think.  You know, I think he's part Spanish.  Uh-huh.  So am I.  So are you?  You are?  Wait, Patty, you're part Spanish?  Wait, you're part Spanish?  We learn something new every day.  My father was Spanish and English, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  You didn't know your father, though, right?  Not really, no.  I'm also Hungarian, German, and Czechoslovakian on my mother's side.  Wow.  She is quite the mutt.  Yeah.  All right, so he's Spanish.  What else?  That's it.  So he's Spanish.  So is he suave?  You know, but anyway, I'll just try again.  She's not answering.  She just laughed.  Patty. 
[01:41:30]  Patty.  Patty.  Is he like a suave Spanish guy?  A suave guy?  Yeah, he's very nice.  Is he classy?  Does he dress nicely?  Is he behind the desk, like, in a nice suit?  Does he wear a good cologne?  He has to get dressed for his job, yeah.  Yeah?  So you're kind of impressed by his appearance?  Yeah, he's very nice.  Very nice.  What does he weigh, let's say?  What does he weigh?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  He's medium build.  He's built like Steve from Bayshore, I'd say, closest to that.  Oh, Steve from Bayshore, loving this, loving this right about now.  Yeah.  Steve, she likes your build.  I believe Stalker Patty might have a little thing for Steve from Bayshore.  Steve from Bayshore.  Bringing up that name like that.  Does he have big sideburns?  Somebody I know, that's all.  Does he have an affinity for 1940s Germany?  No. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, okay.  I mean, I don't know much about him, but, you know, I should get to know him better, I think.  Yeah.  And what, do you talk at all?  What interest does he have?  Does he look like a movie star?  No, he hasn't said very much beyond, like, hello, how are you, going to the bus?  That's not good.  Yeah, I'm going to the bus, you know, whatever.  How do you know he likes...  Even though I don't go for a couple months at a time, he still recognizes me when I get off the bus. 
[01:43:00]  Well, Patty, that's not necessarily a good thing.  People recognized the elephant man when he got off the bus, too.  Yeah.  How do you know he really likes you?  There had to be something.  Yeah, maybe he does, you know, he does.  I'm the only one he talks to, really, when I get off the bus.  But you don't have much in common with a bunch of older ladies, either, or, you know, whatever.  I'm usually sometimes the youngest person on the bus.  Wow.  What is it, a hearse?  I mean, there are some people who do get on the bus that are younger, but they're mostly, like, from, I guess, I don't know, just average people. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, all right.  We're not going to get much more out of you, Patty.  Just like everybody else in this world.  No.  Yeah, you're crazy, though.  You're going to be 52, still a virgin.  We've been working on you for, it's getting close to 10 years now.  Wow.  Enough with the guilt of growing up. 
[01:44:00]  Go out there and get some action.  Well, I will.  I'll start with this guy, you know, get to know him better.  What do you mean by, yeah, and what do you mean by I'll get some action from this guy?  What does that mean?  Because people are like, what?  Their eyes are wide open out there now?  No.  She pretty much means maybe they'll go get a cup of coffee together.  A cup of coffee.  That's action for Patty.  Maybe you can hold hands, you know?  Hold hands.  Walk down the boardwalk, Patty will wear that oldie 1920s bathing suit that the women wore 
[01:44:30]  back then with the little frilly skirts.  I went down in the pantaloons.  I have a one-piece bathing suit, and it's very colorful.  So you'll walk the boardwalk with him, hand in hand.  What color is it?  Brown and yellow?  No.  So he can win you some prizes on the boardwalk?  You know the game where you take the baseball and have to throw it at Patty's head?  Ah, come on, doll.  It's a night out on the boardwalk with Patty. 
[01:45:00]  I think I might get a little something.  Oh, no, we're just going to hold hands.  Come on, doll.  It's me and you.  I'll win you a cupidol.  No, I can't accept your cupidol.  I might have to do some sexual favors.  Come on, sweetie.  Let's go back to the claridge.  Just me and you.  The claridge.  The claridge.  Even sounds old.  Hubba hubba.  Sounds old time.  What does that mean?  If it's sex, get away from me. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I don't do hubba hubba.  It tastes funny.  Hey, Patty.  What is it going to take for you to get some real action from a guy?  Someone that I know very, very well that I have an attraction to.  Would you have sex out of wedlock?  I would have to get a little bit beyond that because I was raised in such a strict, restricting 
[01:46:00]  environment that it's like sex.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So, sex out of marriage is out of the question.  So, how far would you go?  Um, I guess, uh, I don't know, far enough that I wouldn't be, uh, risking making a baby  if I was younger.  Making a baby.  All right.  So.  Talk like a 52-year-old.  All right.  I know.  Really.  So, you wouldn't do the making baby thing.  Making a baby.  Unless you were married, right?  Right.  But, you know.  Would you, uh, would you do, what else, what would you allow? 
[01:46:30]  I want to know what goes on in a strict Catholic's, uh, upbringing's head.  Well.  You would allow hand-holding?  Would you allow, how can we say it, man?  Cheat kissing.  A cheek kiss.  Yeah.  Would you, would you, uh, would you do any deep mouth kissing?  Ah.  Well, if I was that attracted to the person, like everyone else, I guess.  I stole a kiss from Patty on the steel pier watching the diving horse. 
[01:47:00]  I found my bathing suit, by the way.  I'm holding it up in front of the camera.  I don't know if you can see it.  Ah, there's your bathing suit.  Let me take a little look at Patty's stupid bathing suit.  Keep holding it there, you dolt.  It has kind of a tie-dye look to it, it looks like.  I don't know.  Patty, so, I mean, how far would you go with a guy without getting married?  You know, far enough, I guess.  That's the show that I can. 
[01:47:30]  Toledo.  Ha, ha, ha.  But, um, pshh.  I'm not going to get down and nasty or anything, and I'll go for kinkiness, you know what I mean?  All right, we didn't even ask that.  Of course not.  I'm not nasty.  Call me Miss Patty.  Ha, ha, ha.  Patty, would you, uh, I don't know how to say this stuff.  Um, would you, uh, would you take care of him in any way? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, I try to make him happy.  Well, put it this way.  Would your date ever get to the point where he would leave satisfied in every single way?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Interesting.  Yeah, if I was that attractive.  Attractive to him.  Right.  Attractive.  Attractive.  Attractive.  All right.  Uh, let's go to, let's go to Steve in Bayshore. 
[01:48:30]  Steve.  Oh, good morning, dude.  Hey, Steve.  Steve, uh, Patty, um, I don't know, seems to enjoy your body type.  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  Well, I called in to announce, uh, my total retirement from the show and suicide.  He was leaving and killing himself, Patty.  Yeah, because she didn't just come up.  Thanks for this, Patty.  Uh, hey, have a great day, guys.  Wait, wait, no, Steve. 
[01:49:00]  She didn't just come up with this, by the way.  I think she's been taking a look at you.  Yeah.  Uh, I have no idea, but, uh, yeah, that's very nice.  Thanks, Patty.  Um, I'm going to go slam my face into a door.  I thought that's the guy's build reason.  Yeah, but to, to.  I didn't know you liked my beauty type.  You know, Patty, to bring it up and then to have him pop into your head like that, that  might be something.  When you pop up, uh, videos on Pal Talk, is Steve from Bayshore's camera one of them 
[01:49:30]  that you pop up?  No, only the people that I really, really know.  That's the, you know, just the two studios.  Because it's too dirty to have other people's videos.  She doesn't live in reality.  All right.  All right, Steve.  All right, goodbye, guys.  Goodbye.  They're calling him Steve the Body Bayshore.  All right.  All right, Patty.  So, once again, getting nowhere with you.  Yep.  More years, just tick-tock ticking by, and, uh, you're still, uh, uh, a virgin.  Yeah, you're missing a lot of fun out there, Patty. 
[01:50:00]  I might surprise you one of these days.  Maybe I'll meet somebody this weekend.  I intend to go hang out at the showboat this time.  Oh.  I'm in there.  Are you staying there, Patty?  And my card from Claridge connects with the, with the, with the showboat, because they're  both, uh, owned by the same people.  Oh, right.  Oh, really?  So, her what?  Her card?  Her card from the Claridge.  Yeah.  My card from the Claridge is good at the showboat.  What, what does the card from the Claridge, uh, get you? 
[01:50:30]  A free buffet?  Half a buffet?  What?  What do you get?  Free soft drink?  Um, I could eat for free.  I could have all the coffee I want for free.  I could go to shows for free.  Do you know how to play Texas Hold It?  Yeah, of course she does.  I think I knew how to play cards, you know?  I, I don't know how to do.  Right.  Oh, I, I thought it was her saying, hold it?  Yeah.  But no, no, yeah.  I, I, I, well, it works, it works the other way, too. 
[01:51:00]  We, we want you to play Texas Hold It, uh, Patty.  I think we, you're missing out.  Well, first of all, those are expensive.  I could never afford to do anything like that.  I just watch when people do that.  Thanks for getting the joke.  All right.  Uh, Patty.  What?  All right, Patty.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  We'll see you at the showboat this weekend.  By the way, you're looking more and more like Geddy Lee every day.  You gotta do something with that hair.  It's getting a little too long and it, you need to, you need to shape it up and get it 
[01:51:30]  a little fluffy.  A little conditioner in there.  Something's, something's going on.  You're looking like Geddy Lee more than ever.  No, I just woke up.  This is what I'm.  No, I'm talking about FH Riley's over the weekend.  All right, Patty.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Here's the last clip.  Experts say 40 to 50 year olds need sex ed's refresher course.  Health care experts blame it on the proliferation of sexual enhancement drugs and online matchmaking 
[01:52:00]  services and insist boomers need a refresher course in sex ed.  There's no reason one has to become infected with it or any STD.  I gotta tell you, I'm with you guys.  I mean, I thought this lady was a lot older.  Yeah.  She's pushing 50.  That's it.  She should know better.  Who is it educated?  Or 65 or something or 65.  It's a little different.  You know, I'm sorry, but whenever they talk about AIDS and education, sexual education like  that, like who is it educated?  I must be ignorant thinking that everybody by this point is educated. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know.  And we feel sorry for the old Betty's.  I mean, these, these enhancement drugs are just great.  They're not ready for it.  Havoc all over the place.  You can't open an email without getting a spam from one of these Viagra or Cialis things.  So, you know, the guys are trying them out and the wives haven't had to deal with that  in years.  Yeah.  And now the hubby comes to bed and oh my God.  These wives, a lot of them, they closed down, they closed down the business years ago,  man.  Forget about it.  You drive through the town and go, oh, I remember that business. 
[01:53:00]  There's a lot of action in that store.  You got to soften the beaches before you prepare for a landing.  Right.  You can't send in the troops.  You take your pants off, it's like a Springsteen song.  It's a broken downtown that no one has seen.  That's what's going on.  They closed business a long time ago.  These drugs have come along and all of a sudden, you know, people are expecting you to open  up the business again.  There's a lot of work that's got to be done. 
[01:53:30]  You got to buy new product.  You got to buy new plumbing.  You got to shine up the place.  You got to paint.  You got to get a paint job.  All sorts of stuff.  You got to get all the creaks out of the hardware.  Let's just put it that way.  It just, it just, it's not ready.  It's not ready.  It's not ready.  But here's the problem.  There's a brand new Starbucks on the corner that just opened.  They're ready for business. 
[01:54:00]  They're certainly ready.  They're ready for business.  All right.  So then you have no choice.  You're like, I got to open up my business again.  Yep.  They don't want it though.  They're done.  Their business is over.  I imagine how many older women are just cursing the drug companies for coming up with these drugs.  Do you think the wives are annoyed and don't want it anymore?  So like little kids, they try to go to bed like before supper and just pretend they're sleeping.  So when he crawls into bed like a kickstand, they're like, just stop already. 
[01:54:30]  I'd imagine, you know, maybe we could hear, I don't know how many older women are listening to us today.  Maybe they are.  Give us a call after the break and, you know, let us know what's going on.  Because I know a lot of you just closed your business a long time ago and you don't want to reopen.  Shut that door.  And you have no choice.  Retired.  Because there's shiny brand new businesses all around you.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:55:00]  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I want to welcome Pal Talk officially to the program.  Yeah.  Finally spending a little money.  My God.  My God.  Do you know, I...  It's about time.  I still pay for my own membership.  Do you really?  After all this, I just, every time I log on now, I get this little bing, two weeks and your membership expires.  I'm like, oh, I got to re-sign up.  But, you know, I don't even mind because it's such a cool, like, thing. 
[01:55:30]  Sometimes, you know, you get bored with just the internet because you're just kind of, like, trolling around.  You do the same thing.  I spent, and especially the past couple of days, more time in front of a goddamn computer just tooling around the same sites over and over again to see if anything's developing.  And then occasionally you just go, you know something?  I'm just going to pop on Pal Talk, see who's hanging out, see what's up.  And you find your little community.  You find the ONA fans in one of the rooms or something like that.  And you just pop in and have some laughs and, you know, goof on each other. 
[01:56:00]  I just hope Lisa, like, took advantage and really got a ridiculous rate from Pal Talk.  Isn't it the other way?  People take advantage of Lisa?  Yeah, pretty much.  It's about time she gets to take advantage of somebody else.  I hope she got a ridiculous rate because these guys have been getting the advertising for who knows how long.  Yeah.  But officially, welcome to the program, Pal Talk.  And sponsors every day, aren't we?  I'm talking with Pal Talk, guys. 
[01:56:30]  Now I'm a show, and I'm Lisa.  I should go on Pal Talk.  You want to be my pal?  She kind of has that Fran Drescher thing going.  Yeah, exactly.  That's where we're getting at.  She's much hotter than Fran Drescher, but that voice.  That voice.  My God.  She's a sexy lady. 
[01:57:00]  Until she opens her mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  Or she's a little rough.  A little rough.  She's very small.  She's a very small gal.  Yeah.  She kind of bounces in.  She smells good.  She's in shape.  Oh, boy, is she?  She looks like she should be doing, like, a workout video, you know.  She's 53 years old.  Oh, my God.  She is going to kill you.  She is going to kill you.  Holy Jesus.  That means she can only go out with 35-year-olds right now. 
[01:57:30]  You're blowing up her spot.  Oh, no.  I got AIDS.  Oh, right there.  Oh, no.  I wasn't using a condom.  I got AIDS.  Can I sell it?  Can I sell a sponsorship?  Try to hospice the sponsorship.  There you go.  But she signed up Pal Talk.  Very cool.  Let's say hi to Bob in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Bob? 
[01:58:00]  Bob.  Hey, Bob.  He's been sitting there for an hour.  Stupid Bob.  Bob.  Oh, my God.  I had a nice little thing for Bob.  Bob doesn't know what he just...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Bob.  Bob.  Oh.  Bob.  Hey.  Bob, where the hell were you?  I'm trying to get my baby out the door.  That doesn't even sound right.  Let's just leave it there and let the listeners imagine. 
[01:58:30]  I'm trying to get my baby out the door.  What?  My speaker phone's on and I'm just hearing Bob.  Before Chris Hansen walks in?  What are you...  Hello, I'm Chris Hansen, Bob.  Take a seat.  All right, I'll bite.  So why are you trying to get your baby out the door?  Because I've been on home for like 45 minutes.  No, where's your baby going?  Yeah, where's she going?  She's going to take care.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you're one of the lucky ones.  Let someone else raise your kid.  That's it.  I think my wife allowed me to get out for the weekend.  And I was like, oh, I'd love to go to poker. 
[01:59:00]  Nice little place, the McMartin School, I hear.  It's been a while since their name's made an appearance.  Why not?  That's horrible.  Hey, Bob.  Hey.  Guess what?  Guess what?  What?  Opie, why didn't you tell him?  I forgot why we went to Bob now. 
[01:59:30]  So did I.  No, Bob, you want a seat at the poker tournament?  I would love it.  All right, we got a few more tickets left or a few more spots.  It's the ONA Poker Tournament this weekend in Atlantic City at the Showboat Hotel and Casino.  First prize, $20,000.  And we got a pair of tickets for you, courtesy of?  PalTalk.com.  The only place to see our show live from the studio.  So, Bob, hold on a line.  We're going to give you a spot in the tournament, okay?  Awesome.  Thank you, guys.  And by the way, this is sold out at this point, 
[02:00:00]  but we're expecting a lot of listeners just to go down and hang and have a good time.  We're doing a VIP party.  Oh, after that tournament's over, too.  The tables are going to open up,  and we're going to seriously be kicking each other's ass at the poker table.  Yeah, we'll probably have another tournament right after the official tournament.  So there you go, Bob.  Hold on to the line, okay?  Thanks, guys.  Look at Marissa on PalTalk looking all smug from her victory this weekend on Saturday.  She came over?  Looking all smug.  No, I went out.  Went out to a game.  I got a little pest game that goes on. 
[02:00:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  It's fun.  But she won.  I got knocked out early.  I was stupid.  I made stupid moves at the beginning of the game.  Yeah.  Then I tried to make a comeback and just, dah, dah.  What are your chances at winning the ONA Poker Tournament?  You can never tell.  Here's what we were figuring.  And we were talking about this over the weekend playing poker.  We figure it's going to be a lot of people that are there just for the event itself that  probably aren't that knowledgeable at poker. 
[02:01:00]  So you're going to get a lot of stupid play, which takes the pros and the good players right  out of the game.  Speaking of stupid play, Poe was there Saturday at the poker game.  And I thought Marissa was going to slit his throat.  Why?  He was playing the worst hands ever, following him right through to the end, no matter how  high anyone raised, and winning.  Like right at the river, he'd pull the last card and win. 
[02:01:30]  And he should have been out of the hand.  I love guys like that.  Oh, he gets so lucky.  I love guys like that.  It just proves that the whole thing is luck.  No, because in the long run, he loses.  Thank you, Jimmy.  In the long run, he loses.  I love you guys that think you actually have a strategy for hold'em.  There is.  Shut up.  There is.  In the long run, he loses.  Yeah, you've got to be in enough tournaments and play him out.  That night he lost.  I'm going all in firsthand.  Let's see what you got.  God bless.  Let's see what you got.  That I can't wait to see.  I'm going to be one of those Poe players to mess up everyone's strategy. 
[02:02:00]  7-2.  Yeah.  What?  7-2.  He had a 7-deuce.  Perfect.  Which is the worst hand in poker.  Off suit, what do you got?  You got a couple what?  A couple diamonds in the hole?  What do you got?  Just a 7?  He won with a 3-of-a-kind.  See?  There you go.  He wins with a 3-of-a-kind.  And I just heard Marissa scream, and then she comes in holding the cards like they're  covered in animal feces with her fingers.  And she goes, he won with this. 
[02:02:30]  Just garbage.  There you go.  Alex, what happens when you start, I always call it a 7-tour.  A 7-tour?  Yeah.  You start with a 7-tour.  Yeah.  Well, this is the type of play I think we can expect from a lot of people.  They'll be knocked out.  They will be knocked out.  Nah.  But a newbie's going to win.  A poker newbie's going to win the whole thing this weekend.  It doesn't work that way.  It certainly does.  It's all luck.  They take people out.  They have to just have a good poker face and just a good slide.  They make people mad.  They do take people out.  But they end up being eliminated before the end. 
[02:03:00]  Believe me, you don't get one of these bad players that last very long.  You playing Ope?  I have to.  So I'm going all in firsthand.  Ope firsthand is all in no matter what he has.  Blind.  Don't even look at your cards.  And then when all the cards are out, just flip yours over.  All right.  That's what I'm doing.  And see what you have.  And then I'll just be a cheerleader.  It is all luck, basically.  You're right.  Yeah.  Poker.  Hold them especially.  Well, you got to make a funny face with the other guy.  I got better cards.  You don't have to make a funny face.  It's called a poker face.  And it's not letting anybody on to what you have based on what you do. 
[02:03:30]  You keep reading your hold'em books.  I'm not.  This is through experience.  Yeah, whatever.  It's all luck.  It is not all luck.  How did I make it to the final table and win on the cruise ship?  I went first.  I went second.  I went second and third.  Because you were playing with a bunch of old people.  They didn't even know.  They thought they were playing Pinar.  They all knew.  They all knew how to play.  I was in the money every single time.  Look, this weekend, I'm all in first hand.  First hand. 
[02:04:00]  And then I'm going where the real action is.  Card counting.  At the blackjack table.  Easy.  Card counting.  QT.  Looking for the dealer that doesn't know how to hide the last card in the deck.  Oh.  You know, somebody told me that.  Oh, man.  Someone told me this, and I thought it was crap.  Because I've seen people.  You know, you've played three-card poker before.  Yeah.  When the dealer takes their cards and puts them in front of them,  if you sit to the dealer's left,  sometimes you could see that bottom card. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Depending on the dealer.  Sometimes they cover it up with a yellow card first.  Yes.  But I came across a dealer at some casino where I could see that bottom card.  And that's 33% of their cards that you're now seeing.  Yeah.  So if that's a crappy card that isn't a queen qualifier or whatever they need,  you have a better chance,  and you are more willing to play the hand that you have.  Absolutely was doing that.  Yeah.  Couldn't believe it.  I would have told him.  That's cheating.  Shut up. 
[02:05:00]  I'm not even saying what casino it was.  I'm not even saying what state it was.  By the way, and don't even worry about it.  The back rooms are easy.  Nowadays.  Yeah, the back rooms are a casino.  It's not the mob anymore.  They're easy.  It's not the fun days where they drop a bowling ball from five feet onto your hand.  Would they?  Oh, sure.  Oh, yeah.  The stories are legendary, what they used to do in the back room.  Now it's just a couple bruises, and you can move on.  Back to card counting.  Card counting.  You know, at the casinos, they don't even worry about card counting in general, 
[02:05:30]  because most people don't know how to do it right.  No, they lose money anyway.  And so they're betting more money thinking they have the knowledge and they don't,  and that's the one thing the casinos will not tell you.  That's why they're not cracking down completely on card counting.  No, there's probably five people in total that have been banned from all the casinos for  card counting.  But then there's dopes like me.  You read one book and you think you're an expert, so now you're just betting way more  than you ever would.  I could do that.  1.2, minus one, minus two.  Where was I?  Dealer, could you stop?  I was at minus three. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  That's why.  Casinos, it's the best thing that ever happens in the casinos.  People actually putting out tapes and books on how to beat blackjack.  They just know a bunch of dummies are going to go in with too much confidence because  they think they have the knowledge, and they don't.  I actually have a notebook and I'll jot down.  I'll be like, what was that?  A two?  And I put checks.  I put little checks by my...  You know what I like to do?  I like to put them on the cards.  Yeah, I play...  Take a Sharpie.  Yeah.  Oh, man, that was my joke.  You take a Sharpie and write on the backs of the cards, A, J, K, 9, 8. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, that was your joke?  Yeah, and I didn't get a lot of doozies in today.  I was hoping that was going to be my...  Okay, hold on.  Master Poe is on the line.  Master Poe.  What's up?  How are we doing, guys?  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Master Poe, you were a big hit at the poker game on Saturday, but you were really annoying  people.  Uh-huh.  Did you notice that some of the hands you played may have gotten some people annoyed? 
[02:07:00]  Uh, yeah.  They didn't like when I played the 2-7.  Yeah.  It's also known as the worst hand in poker.  And it's okay if you're, you know, if you want to try it, maybe see what comes out or  something like that.  But I hear you were chasing down a lot of hands.  Like, someone would raise to get you out, and you'd get lucky on the last card.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You know, that does, like, kind of get people annoyed.  It's part of the game.  It's something you've got to deal with. 
[02:07:30]  But, um, yeah, you usually get a talking to.  Well, you know, I played the game like anything else.  I wanted to see how people would react.  And Aby got very, very angry.  Um, the young lady to my left, I forgot her name.  Betty.  It was Betty.  She was also angry.  Yes.  Um, you could pretty much say everyone was angry.  Poe is right, though.  If he all of a sudden has some cards and he wants to get three of a kind, that's the right  way.  Depending on raising just to chase a guy out is wrong. 
[02:08:00]  Good for you, Poe.  Yeah.  Beat these dopes.  No, here's what you have, though.  You know you have, at that moment, you know you have the best hand.  You know you have the best hand.  So you don't want another card to come out just in case they do get lucky.  Sure.  So you raise the crap out of them.  And then they call you on that with nothing and then get lucky.  Now, it's part of the game.  I'm going to just say it is part of the game.  But it's not a winning strategy because the odds are, and this is where the luck part and 
[02:08:30]  the skill part come into play.  You're not going to get that lucky every time.  But if I have two cards and I want a third card and I say, like, you know, I have a seven  and I have a two.  Yeah.  I'd love two more sevens.  Right.  What's wrong with that?  The odds are it's not going to happen.  Yeah.  But you can still hope.  Yeah.  You can still hope.  It all plays with hope.  I got a little hope in my heart.  All right.  Well, you might win a few hands.  You might even win a couple of games.  But in the long run, that ain't a good strategy. 
[02:09:00]  The style's called willy-nilly.  Willy-nilly.  I read the book by willy-nilly.  Did you ever read the poker book?  It was, yeah, a strategy called willy-nilly.  No logic.  Hey, let's get this in before we get out of here.  Chicago Board of Ed sued for teacher allegedly showing Brokeback Mountain in class.  Now, I thought maybe this was high school students or something like that.  Apparently, they were 12-year-olds.  So, what, fifth, sixth grade?  Yeah.  Depending on what neighborhood you live in? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  That's a little rough.  Brokeback Mountain is an R-rated movie.  I remember as a kid, they used to bring in some movies for us to watch.  Well, this is classic substitute teacher behavior.  You get the substitute teacher and you see the film projector.  Well, now we're going back.  A film projector sitting there in the middle of the back.  And you're like, yes, movie time.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  And the kids' faces are just like, oh, my God.  They're all making that butthead face.  Their mouths are just open. 
[02:10:00]  No sound.  What the hell is this?  But 12 years old.  I remember in school, though, when we used to watch a movie, they'd like wheel.  It was such a big procedure.  They'd wheel in equipment.  And it was the tech guy or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, the AV geek.  That's right, the AV geek.  The AV geek.  But some films, we'd have to get permission slips from our parents.  We'd have to go home and say, we're going to be watching this movie.  And am I allowed? 
[02:10:30]  And some parents would say no.  And they'd take them out of the room.  But for a 12-year-old to watch an R-rated movie, that is a little odd.  Those substitute teachers.  But this is what gets me.  The lawsuit now.  A little Jessica Turner, 12, suffered psychological distress after viewing the movie in her 8th grade class.  The film, of course, won three Oscars, depicts two cowboys who conceal their homosexual affair.  You know, I still haven't seen that movie.  Me neither.  It's a good movie.  I know.  You told me.  It is a good movie. 
[02:11:00]  Me and you want to watch it together.  Have the girls glasses.  No.  Let the girls go out.  Me and you will sit down, throw an afghan on, and watch it.  I know what you're doing.  I could just see at the end, Jimmy punching his refrigerator and yelling at Opie to not open the window.  I know.  I love that one.  Close that window.  Close it.  Wish I knew how to make you let me open the window.  Turner and her grandparents, Kenneth and Laverne Richardson, are seeking around $500,000 in damages. 
[02:11:30]  A half a mil because she saw Brokeback Mountain.  Now, there aren't any explicit sex scenes in there.  There's explicit implied sex in the tent.  We all know about the whoop, poof, part of the movie.  I really don't know much about it.  Well, let me tell you, you'll be rewinding that one a few times.  But I don't think a half a mil.  So, everybody's so quick to say how damaged somebody was by something. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, they don't want their children exposed to this type of thing.  Granddaughter was traumatized, as they're saying, by the movie and had to undergo psychological treatment and counseling.  Huh?  In 2005, Richardson complained to school administrators about reading material that he said included curse words.  This was the last straw.  He said, I feel the lawsuit was necessary because of the warning I had already given them on the literature that they were giving out to children to read. 
[02:12:30]  I told them it was against our faith.  Miss Buford.  Did you read this line?  The substitute asked the student to shut the classroom door at the West Side School, saying, and I quote,  what happens in Miss Buford's class stays in Miss Buford's class.  Yeah, Miss Buford's class is like Vegas.  She's a little twisted, huh?  That is not good.  Hey, they're a little young for Brokeback Mountain. 
[02:13:00]  Miss 12 is a little young for Brokeback Mountain.  It's an R-rated movie.  They can't even get in without, like, their parents or guardian being with them.  Yeah, that's...  So, you know, that is a little, uh...  That's obviously a bad choice for a movie.  For a movie.  For a kilter.  Hey, Jay in Indiana.  Hey, you guys totally missed Old Slyne about 12-year-olds, depending on what neighborhood they live in.  Is it they're in the sixth grade or not?  Oh, no.  I didn't miss anything.  We did not miss anything.  Why don't we just go?  I was only joking. 
[02:13:30]  So there you go.  Another O.P. and Anthony show.  Unscripted, live.  Unpredictable.  Trying to just make people laugh.  That's all.  Just showing up for work.  The most dangerous job in America.  That's it right now.  The shock shock.  Hey, guys, if you're not joining us over at XM Satellite Radio, have a great day.  Jim Norton at Zaney's in Nashville this weekend.  All Thursday through Saturday.  Jeez. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.P. will be the O.P. and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  By an illness.  By a heart disease. 
[02:19:30]  You know, just things you want to chuckle at on the way over.  Me and my pal having a laugh.  Yeah.  Looking so grim.  Looking so grim.  Yeah.  I have more goddamn footage of us walking than I ever want to see.  Yeah.  I think you're done with that.  Enough about us walking.  You don't need any more footage of us walking.  Walking 10 years ago, us walking 10 years ago, us walking 5 years ago, us walking 5 years ago, us walking 5 years ago, us walking yesterday, more walking, Jesus Christ. 
[02:20:00]  How many times have you heard in the last 3 or 4 days, are you sick?  No, just older?  No, just older.  No, just got a little older.  No, just got a little older.  Sorry about that.  Way to show footage from six years ago.  Actually, I was watching some of that footage, my friggin' face was so bloated.  It was just like, I was all bloated.  Yeah?  Drunk in every shot, by the way.  You look much healthier.  Well, I'm working out, Jim. 
[02:20:30]  I gotta get some pounds on me by working out, though, not by just eating.  Just trying to add a little muscle?  I need some bulk.  To that poker physique of yours?  I'm bulking up.  My weight is going up.  Is it really?  Up.  Yep.  It is.  I'm about to 155 pounds.  Wow.  That's right.  What were you back in the NEW days?  180?  Yeah, about 180, 185 sometimes.  That was a...  Yeah.  It was all gut. 
[02:21:00]  That was a soft 180.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  You definitely are much healthier.  They're all...  Ack, ack.  So nice.  All right.  What are we going to do on this side of the show today?  Hmm?  This?  No.  This?  No.  This?  No.  No.  We could still do a lot of stuff.  We could still do a lot of stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Here's something.  King of Queens.  Final episode last night, and no one cared.  All right.  It was the final episode? 
[02:21:30]  It was the final episode, and no one cared.  And I was reading the article about that, and it said there were no people.  If I walked into a bar, and people were watching the game, like it was supposed to be some Seinfeld  final episode.  Where everyone had to watch with friends and family and all that, or in a bar.  Nah.  No one cared.  Nah, no one did.  I mean, it was a successful show, though.  I auditioned for the pilot.  Did you really?  Yeah, yeah.  I got a callback, too.  Never remember a plane on that show?  Oh, no, no.  Not that kind of pilot.  See, I thought it was like a pilot that you flew up. 
[02:22:00]  Sorry.  No.  Who's part?  Kevin James.  No.  It was just, I forget what part of one of his friends.  Because I think they wanted a fat guy for that.  One of his friends.  No, I remember he was getting all his heat from that.  A dope dealer?  Yeah, a dope dealer who couldn't act.  They had to save me for another fucking show for that one.  Fucking driving to the ground.  No talent, nothing.  So, yeah, they're talking about it like it should have been given this send-off, like  Mary Tyler Moore or Seinfeld or something.  How many seasons did that go, by the way, Mary Tyler Moore? 
[02:22:30]  One and a half.  Perhaps more than that, Ope.  Couldn't tell you.  Nine, maybe?  No, a lot of those old shows that you thought were on TV forever, that's just the re-runs.  Five years or something like that.  So many shows, you go, it was only on two seasons.  Yeah.  Or three seasons.  That's true.  Something's going on with TV.  They said that viewership is drastically down in the ratings.  Way down.  Gee, I wonder what it could be.  I know.  Well, what?  But it's everything else that people find entertaining. 
[02:23:00]  Well, they did a little research and they said that it's because the offerings suck.  I'm like, no, I don't think that's it at all.  I think it's because of DVR.  Seven years.  Huh?  Seven years, Mary Tyler Moore.  Seven years?  I think it's because of DVR.  I think it's because of, like you said, everything else.  But no one's talking about King of Queens today.  And another thing no one's talking about today is The Sopranos.  That was a huge storyline on Sunday.  Yeah.  And no one's talking about it. 
[02:23:30]  I think people-  You had something in the paper and like a local news station here in New York did a little  something.  I think because of DVRs, no one's talking about it.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, when we were growing up and there was a big show on TV, the next day, because you  only could see it that one time that it was being offered, you came into work, everyone  knew what you're talking about.  Everyone was talking about it.  Now, how many times do you hear, like Jimmy did it to us yesterday, no, don't tell me  what happened to The Sopranos.  I haven't watched it yet.  Yeah, I still haven't seen it.  That's something that just didn't happen a mere five years ago.  When The Sopranos first came out, we would talk about it after each episode. 
[02:24:00]  Monday would come around and we would talk about it.  Yeah, everyone had seen it.  It wasn't one of those things where, you know, oh, well, some people had taped it, but you  want to smack them over the head with their VHS cassette.  It doesn't compare to the DVR.  No, DVR now is so goddamn easy.  But it's kind of a shame because I used to kind of like that experience.  You'd go to work the next day and all of a sudden everyone saw the show and you would  talk about it.  There's no sharing of the shows anymore, the experience where you talk at once because 
[02:24:30]  you're right.  People go, no, don't say it.  I didn't say it.  Right.  And I'm like, oh, well, what the fuck?  But also I think The Sopranos, they just messed with us too many times.  Yeah, well, they did, but...  Are the ratings still down?  They got to be up for this last one because it's the last season.  It normally goes up.  I don't think they're as up as they were hoping.  Well, they're not like when it first started, that's for sure, but I would think because  they're the final episodes, they got to go up.  I think there's been a drastic drop-off.  Definitely.  How many are they down to?  Three more.  Three episodes left.  That's it. 
[02:25:00]  How many are they this year?  Nine?  I'm sorry.  Eight or nine, yeah.  Okay.  Something like that.  But yeah, that, I don't know.  I find it entertaining.  I like this season.  I didn't like the first episode, but...  There's so much garbage.  It's all like you said yesterday about Aussie show, Reality TV.  Yeah.  And it's phony, awful.  It's not like an Aussie, like the Aussie one where it was like really interesting and  intriguing and funny and like, it's all shit.  It's one good product and then 50 copycats.  Well, they got to reinvent reality programming too because what's going on there is everyone, 
[02:25:30]  at first when reality shows hit, people were like, they didn't know what to expect.  If you're on the show, if you're watching the show, you didn't know what to expect.  It was a brand new thing, right?  Yeah.  Now you get on a reality show, you know you could be a big star for doing something stupid,  so now you're doing stupid stuff that you wouldn't have really done naturally.  You're just looking for that moment that's going to get you in the headlines and get you  like you're the one they're all talking about.  So it's not reality.  But when reality shows first started, it just happened naturally.  Yep. 
[02:26:00]  All of a sudden you had Puck being an asshole because he's an asshole.  Now the guy has to come in playing the part of the asshole.  Right, right.  Because he knows that that's what they want.  And the other thing that they did with reality shows, and this is too bad,  they took away fighting.  Yeah.  If you fight on a reality show, you are kicked off that reality show.  And that used to be a very interesting angle.  Fist fight or argue?  Fist fights.  If you touch another reality star, you're off the show.  Yeah, and it used to be.  And they actually used to do that.  And when we used to watch reality shows, right, when there was a confrontation, 
[02:26:30]  wow, this could get into an ugly area.  But now you see them just like an inch away from each other's face because they both signed  the same contract that says, look, I touch this person, I'm off the show.  Yeah.  What was the MTV?  When did the real world start?  Was it like mid-90s, early 90s?  That was probably 90s.  Yeah, I was going to say, all right, yeah.  Probably 90.  A friend of mine.  Early early 90s at the 90, 91, possibly. 
[02:27:00]  My friend Dave was throwing off that show.  I don't know.  Huh?  My buddy Dave Edwards, a black comedian, was tossed off that show.  Oh, right.  I remember that one.  See, everyone remembers him.  Wait, which one is Dave Edwards?  That was the black guy that dragged the black girl down the hallway.  Oh, yeah.  In the L.A.  Oh, did he?  I don't know.  Real world L.A.  Whatever it was, this is like one of the first ones, or the first season.  That was Tammy or something that ended up marrying the New Jersey sports basketball player.  I don't know what he did.  I think he looked at a girl changing or some shit like that. 
[02:27:30]  No.  No.  They were joking around, and one girl was naked under her covers.  Okay.  And he went to pull.  Not even naked.  She was like panties.  Whatever it was.  Front panties, whatever.  He went to pull the blanket off of her as a goof, and she was like, no, no.  She's screaming like, no, don't do it.  And he kept pulling, and wound up pulling her off the bed and kind of dragging her down  the hallway while she's trying to cover up, because the cameras are rolling.  Everyone was laughing, but then she got really pissed after the fact, and then it started 
[02:28:00]  getting into a whole thing of sexual assault, and this, that, and the other thing.  They started calling it other words.  Yeah.  And he was really just trying to be funny.  Yeah, of course.  At the time, and he's a comedian by nature, and he was just like, he was going for a moment.  And she was like, kind of laugh screaming as it was happening.  It kind of turned into something else.  And yeah, they wound up throwing him off the show.  First real world thank you fan, 1992.  That was 1992.  So I remember when that happened, and me and Dave did a college year, I mean, literally, 
[02:28:30]  probably right before I started working with you guys, like around 2000 or 98, and we were  upstate New York, and fucking, we went into one of those awful side road little gas stations,  and the fat lady behind the counter recognized me.  I'm like, geez, reality TV really made this guy famous.  Yeah.  And that was like, you know, years.  Back then, the ratings for reality shows were massive.  There weren't many.  So you were searching them out.  Now that's all.  Now everything is there.  The Hulk is just funny, though, because they have, like, real interactions. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  I tried to like that show.  It's all scripted, and, well, we've talked about that before.  The news has become a TV show now.  Right.  It's not even like, you know, it's not even like the news anymore.  It's an entertainment television show that they put on.  It's based on, like, a reality show.  They take some aspects that are real, add their own drama to it, and they have a reality show  that changes every day.  The characters change.  The people change.  It's wonderful. 
[02:29:30]  It's a reality show, the news.  Sitcom slash reality.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  And then what's his name?  His show just got thrown off the air.  George Lopez.  George Lopez is an ass.  And I'm saying that because here's a guy who had a show on for five years on television.  Do you know how hard it is to get a show on television, first of all?  There are people that would kill to have a show that lasts five years on television.  A lot of these guys get pilots. 
[02:30:00]  Everyone's excited about it.  It goes two shows, and they yank the show.  Well, our one and only chance lasted five episodes.  Five episodes, was it?  Something like that.  Five episodes too many.  I'm going to disagree that he's an ass guy.  Well, no.  I don't think he's being very humble about them canceling his show, and I think he's not  being very realistic as to why the show has been canceled.  I'll say this.  And again, I'm going to say this.  I have a personal thing. 
[02:30:30]  I like Lopez because when I did the Vail Comedy Festival in 95, he was a big national headliner,  and he was very nice.  Well, then you're dismissed as a juror.  Please leave.  I am biased.  He's always been very nice to me, and he's been much more famous.  He's always been a really sweet guy.  But they were shuffled around some.  I don't even know if it was a good show.  I've never seen it.  It might have been awful.  I don't know.  But they got shuffled around so many times, and they would always make them compete with  American Idol.  I guess they figured to get Spanish people to watch that.  Let me tell you something, though.  They gave them very tough slots.  But for five years.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:31:00]  There are shows that are on, that have tried to be on, that if they were shuffled around  like that and their ratings stunk, they would pull them right off the air.  This guy was able to last for five years on a network television show.  You should count your blessings and move on.  Yeah, but what George is mad at is this.  He's sour grapes.  He's not.  This guy's got enough money in syndications, but he's made for life.  It's not a money issue.  It was a very personal thing for him.  But when you look at the ABC pickup.  Oh, okay. 
[02:31:30]  This is what Lopez scoffed in particular at another ABC pickup, caveman, about two brothers  and one best friend described as sophisticated cave dudes living in modern...  That's right, folks.  Cave dudes.  Cave dudes.  Living in Atlanta who continually find themselves at odds with contemporary society.  So what's going to happen in this one is the network is going to find a way to address racial  issues that they don't have the fucking moral courage to address with real white people,  real black people, real Jews, real gay people, real whatever. 
[02:32:00]  They're going to address social issues that they're too fucking afraid to address with  real people, these fucking jizzbuckus.  So they're going to address it with cavemen so no one can get offended.  God, it's brilliant.  Let's all turn into cavemen.  You know what would be great for this show?  So first episode, the cavemen, and you've seen the commercials.  They're for Geico with the cavemen.  That's what they're talking about.  They're making a show like that where they wear suits and ties and they're more sophisticated  than anybody.  What?  First episode, dinosaur stomps them?  No. 
[02:32:30]  Although that would be funny.  Show over.  Sabertooth tiger?  No.  No, because it's modern times.  They have to...  Look, they have to...  Cave dudes living in modern day Atlanta who continue to find themselves at odds with contemporary  society.  I say the first time they find themselves at odds, they pull out big clubs and smash  in the heads of their contemporary counterparts and then walk away bloodied.  And they get like a Kevin Dillon, like, you see the fucking head come apart?  Come apart like that.  Where they completely just turn caveman. 
[02:33:00]  Cave dude.  Cave dude.  They turn cave dude.  I turned out.  My girlfriend's never seen All in the Family.  Well, she's seen Moments of it, but never watched it.  So we threw in the pilot the other night.  The fucking language they got away with on that show.  Oh my God, I know.  And it was hilarious.  And this is what they're going to do now.  They're going to try to address stuff like All in the Family did with real people.  Yeah.  I mean, without using real people.  I mean, look, Archie and Meathead, they addressed black issues.  They had the black side represented.  They had the gay guys were represented. 
[02:33:30]  Everyone was represented intelligently.  It was a brilliant show.  And now that they're fucking faggots in network TV are too afraid to do that.  The media is doing just an injustice here, man.  You couldn't get All in the Family on the air nowadays.  Of course not.  Who's wrong?  And they think, like, society's out of control right now.  Every night on the news, there's another story about someone doing something stupid  or saying something, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm not even, believe it or not, I'm not even trying to talk about our situation.  I mean, the news is just filled with it every single day now. 
[02:34:00]  It's just brought it out more and made us see it more.  Right, right.  That we're kind of engrossed in something.  And they think we're just a society completely out of control.  Just watch, like, an old sitcom, like, All in the Family, and you realize, yeah, what was this?  Just think also, this was during that time where it was supposed to be, you know,  the people that are in charge now are the people that were like, this is great.  This is, like, where we're open and honest and talking about things and, you know, being free, man. 
[02:34:30]  And who would think that past the year 2000 that was supposed to be so far in the future back then,  we would have been such uptight assholes by now.  We've regressed.  We thought it was going to be this progressive movement from the 60s and 70s  where you could do things like All in the Family and watch, like, Richard Pryor doing his act and stuff.  And, you know, just complete controversy, controversial material, but not take it as controversy. 
[02:35:00]  You accepted that as, like, educational.  It was really an education you were getting by watching these and listening to the comics of the time.  And now we've regressed because we have a fucking stick so far up our asses now about everybody being sensitive to everything  that we've gone back in time as far as it's concerned.  We're heading back to, like, the 50s.  Well, people feel this is the problem.  Everything has to be beyond safe.  We've got to go get our soda pops at a mulch shop. 
[02:35:30]  Go watch the submarine races.  The audience members, and I think a lot of this is because there's so many ways to get involved,  now think they're a part of the creative process.  It's almost like my opinion creatively, no, motherfuckers, it doesn't matter at all.  That's what they think, though.  As opposed to, like, watching Pryor in 1975 and going, this is what I think of this guy.  I love him.  I hate him.  Whatever.  And just looking at his work and saying that's his work. 
[02:36:00]  Now people have to get in and try to change what you're doing because they somehow think that their creative input is important.  Speaking of Pryor, one of the most famous bits ever on SNL was the Pryor Chevy Chase bit where they're going back and forth.  It starts out very mellow, and then they get just going with horrific racial slurs to each other.  And that is a standout as a classic comedy bit that people remember.  Could you, in any way, shape, or form, see that being done on network television? 
[02:36:30]  Well, even back then, Pryor had problems because he was doing his show, and the networks, they weren't letting him, NBC wasn't letting him do what he wanted to do.  It lasted four episodes, and there was a great sketch he did where, did you ever see the sketch of Pryor?  He's in the corner, like he's talking, and in the corner there's like a deaf person acting something out.  It's him totally naked but with his, like, dick and stuff blacked out or browned out so it looks like just skin. 
[02:37:00]  And he's basically implying the network has cut off his balls.  They've taken his genitals, and they wouldn't let him show it.  There was some big thing, but he had so many problems with the networks back then doing what he wanted to do.  He yanked the show.  Is that part of the box set or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can see it.  Look it up on YouTube.  It might be on YouTube.  Fan, please, for hope.  But there were, it was just that whole time.  Did I say on Justice?  Yes, you did.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  There was this, we honestly back then, I think, and by we, I was a fucking kid, but I mean, I guess people, from what I've heard anyway, thought there would be this progression to more openness and freedom and freedom of speech and comedy and things like that. 
[02:37:30]  But it's gotten so repressive that it's made people scared, frightened.  But where is it coming from?  It's not coming from the majority.  I don't know.  No, it's not.  It's coming from the media looking for, they're just trying to fill up their dumb time.  Back in the day, you got news, what, a couple times a day? 
[02:38:00]  A couple times a day.  Six o'clock, 11 o'clock.  I think that is the real problem.  You had news that was maybe on an hour day on just a few channels.  That's all you got.  You didn't have the internet, obviously, or anything else.  You maybe picked up a newspaper.  But now you got these 24-hour news channels.  They got to fill up their time.  Fill up your show.  So they're just making, pretty much trying to create their own stories just to fill up their programming.  Make stuff up as they go along.  They do, though.  I mean, we know they make stuff up as they go along.  They absolutely add and subtract things from stories. 
[02:38:30]  Some of these stories that they, and I'm just talking generally again, some of these stories they come up with on the 24-hour news channels, they leave out this.  They leave out that.  You know why?  Because they could get a little more time from it.  A little more mileage.  A little more mileage from that story.  Make the story more interesting if you leave something out.  Some of these stories, if they just gave you all the facts right off the bat, one and done.  Good.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  But you leave out an important fact here.  You get a little vague over here. 
[02:39:00]  What does that do?  It's got some legs.  Peaks a little more, peaks a little interest.  Yeah, sure.  It has legs, and you can do a little more time on it.  Oh, wow.  It is infuriating that we've come to this weird time.  And this is the part that's not being said on TV.  It's not the majority.  It's just not.  No.  I'm sick of hearing people say people have spoken.  The marketplace has decided.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:39:30]  Most people don't care about any of this stuff that's going on.  They care about...  It doesn't affect them.  Taking care of their families, going to work, and on an off chance, maybe getting a little  laugh and being entertained every so often.  And that's what the majority does.  There's a bunch of little smaller groups out there that think they're representative of  the majority and the people, the country. 
[02:40:00]  I heard Patrice's piece last night on Fox News.  The woman that was with him, that was against him, I guess, his counterpart on the show, was  talking about how the country, the country has spoken and the country is upset.  And Patrice turned around and said, are you representing the country?  Like, you are now representing...  And she said, no, no.  But the country...  He goes, I don't speak for the country. 
[02:40:30]  You're speaking for the country?  Right.  And it made so much sense.  Most polls on all these sensitive issues show that they don't care.  More people don't care.  No.  No, it's...  But, by the way, again...  Patrice's appearance on Fox News Channel was just, from a comedic standpoint, beyond  unbelievable.  And we can't...  People are requesting that we play it here.  We can't.  Maybe someday we can, but right now we can't.  But it's up on Whackbag, I believe, and on YouTube.  I don't know if it's on YouTube. 
[02:41:00]  You've got to do, like, the secret search until it's in general search.  But I think it's on Whackbag somewhere if you want to go find it.  But anyway, sorry.  Just, yeah, Patrice, great stuff.  But, yeah, we've got...  The news has reached this point where, like Ops said, just it has to fill time.  So what are they going to do?  Make stories.  They entertain things that wouldn't have been entertained years ago.  They don't have bronchite or any of those guys. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have the time.  They only get, like I said, a half hour, an hour tops.  There's important news that you need to know.  And then there's filler material.  It's all the filler.  That gets thrown in.  And the filler becomes important because it's part of the news.  And they need to fill, so they get the details wrong or leave things out.  I hate to think they do it on purpose, but I've been involved enough in the media to know that it is done.  I think they do.  That things are left out on purpose to make something sound a little better or worse. 
[02:42:00]  The best example of this is Anna Nicole Smith.  Who gives a shit?  The news channels did.  The MSNBC especially.  Rita Crosby was all over that case.  One of the last things she did.  That's why they cut her off.  It was around the clock covered.  When they showed a helicopter shot of Anna Nicole Smith's hearse being backed up to the mortuary.  Right.  And her being wheeled out of the back of it, I'm watching going, is this Anna Nicole or a president? 
[02:42:30]  I can understand if the president, that is worth getting a helicopter, fueling it up, getting the camera equipment, flying out somewhere, and filming the top of a hearse and something being wheeled out.  But for Anna Nicole Smith, a stripper that married an old guy for money.  And it was breaking news, shocking news, all those terms they use. 
[02:43:00]  And I'm like, shocking?  This is, oh, it finally happened, news.  Yeah, yeah.  It was not a surprise.  It wasn't anything.  But that's the type of news environment we live in now.  And it's this whole information overload that we have now where everybody is a reporter, everyone is a photographer for the news, everyone has their own commentary columns now.  If you go to Google News and pop in a subject, you'll find ABC, Networks, CNN, all that on a subject. 
[02:43:30]  And then you'll find blogs under the same category as news.  And you click on it, and it looks like a news page.  But the reality is, it's some guy sitting in his basement typing his opinion on things.  And then the actual news finds that and puts it on the news as news. 
[02:44:00]  It's a guy.  This is a guy that we used to have to write a letter to the news organization.  And then if you remember, at about 10.30 or 11 o'clock, the president of the network or whatever would get on and voice an opinion.  Right.  I'm going to speak to you today about traffic.  I'm Steve Schaefer.  Traffic.  The president of Channel 11.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Your opinions are welcome.  Right.  And then some guy would write a letter, and sometimes he'd be invited on.  Yeah.  In rebuttal to this is Bob Smith. 
[02:44:30]  And Bob Smith would be sitting there and talk about how the expressway needs to be fixed.  And that was pretty much the furthest you were able to go in media.  Now everyone is a journalist.  Everybody with a computer has become a journalist.  A journalist that is respected.  Yeah.  That is taken by people like Drudge and by the network news and quoted.  And photos are taken from their sites, videos. 
[02:45:00]  We've reached this point of insanity.  Well, look at every blog has to have a comment section.  It's not like reading the paper anymore.  You have to be able to comment.  I like to state my opinion as well.  I don't want to just read.  I want to get my opinion in there.  Right.  It's just as important as yours.  Everyone has become so important that there aren't any more people left.  Everyone is a boss.  Everyone's a responsible for something. 
[02:45:30]  Everyone has this opinion that isn't just a personal opinion.  It's an opinion that I now have printed and now is accepted by people.  So I now am influential.  There's no, there's no, like, just people left to just be the people.  You know, everyone, you know, remember when you used to pick sides for anything, a game of cowboys and Indians or you play army or something like that.  Everyone couldn't be the general or the lieutenant. 
[02:46:00]  You needed some soldiers.  It's a double-edged sword, though, don't you think?  Because at least you're getting more opinions out there.  No, but we're the important people with opinions.  Fuck everyone else is what I'm saying.  Attaboy it.  I'm teasing.  Shut up.  But I guess what you're saying is there should be some kind of filter system.  But like when we were growing up, there was only three news sources.  I just want accountability.  I personally would like a few more angles on this myself.  Dude, and this is funny.  Some people might find it funny coming out of me. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  But I just want accountability.  I want people to tell me where this info came from.  Right, right.  If the news reports that people are saying, and we saw this on one of those specials that you should see.  What the hell was that called?  Michael Moore's thing?  No, it was on Fox.  It was a documentary on Fox and what they do.  Yeah.  And one thing that stands out in our minds is the people are saying, and it now pokes me in my ear like an ice pick whenever it's used. 
[02:47:00]  Because they'll say, people are saying, and then come out with this opinion.  With no accountability as to where it came from, who said it, who are these people.  Some have said, that's another one, some have said.  When they're saying people are saying, they're saying we're saying.  We're saying, or maybe a blog said it.  But they don't have the balls to say that because, you know.  It leaves them free to use anything from personal visual experience in this situation to third or fourth hand blogging of the situation. 
[02:47:30]  They can just say, some have said, people are saying, we're hearing.  Like, it's this zero accountability that is being put out on the news that people, some people still, stupid people, think is the news.  They don't think it's an entertainment show, which it is.  Right.  But when you hear people are saying, and please keep this in mind, really think about, why aren't they telling me who?  Right.  Well, last night, America has spoken. 
[02:48:00]  America has spoken.  Have they?  People are saying?  Some have said?  Maybe America is worried about filling their gas tanks this summer.  Highest gas prices ever.  How about that?  I think there's other things they're really talking about.  That must be the war for oil.  Oh, right.  High prices.  Outfox.  What happened?  Outfox, it was called.  Thank you, NK in Boston.  If you're into, like, media and how they manipulate and stuff, Outfox is the documentary for you. 
[02:48:30]  It is really interesting what they uncovered.  I have a question maybe one of you guys knows, because I don't know the answer to this, and  this guy's been bugging me for a year.  What the fuck does Paul Wolfowitz do?  He's the head of the World Bank.  We all know that.  He's rich.  He's a very powerful guy.  He's a fuddy-duddy.  He is a fuddy-duddy.  Does he?  Oh, wait.  That's Phil Spector.  Oh, they're calling Phil Spector a fuddy-duddy?  There's your newspaper.  The headline is fuddy-duddy. 
[02:49:00]  And they want respect from us?  Go F yourselves.  What the fuck does Wolfowitz?  Wasn't he in charge of Iraq?  What was he doing in Iraq?  Can someone...  I bet Wolfowitz.  What?  Than.  Than, if you would please.  I've heard the name, like, Jimmy, a million times.  I couldn't even tell you what business he's doing.  Than will inform.  You had the World Bank.  Yeah, that's all I got from the media so far.  And he was born in 2005.  He was also Deputy Secretary of Defense for President Bush. 
[02:49:30]  Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Where is the World Bank located?  On the world, Jimmy.  No, I don't know.  Queens?  I was buying that for a minute.  It's right next to an Astoria Federal.  The World Bank.  Yeah, where would you put your main branch?  I'm sure it's here to annoy us, like the UN.  Wait, is that wrong that his defense guy is, like, the banking guy?  I know they were all talking about that.  I'm five years too late with this information.  I'm just curious.  What?  Are you saying, like, maybe a conflict of interest? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Big banker is your fucking Secretary of Defense?  Who cares about that stuff?  Yes, man.  The conflict of interest.  The group's headquarters are in Washington, D.C.  Ah, Washington, D.C.  Washington.  But technically, the World Bank is part of the United Nations system.  So, all right.  Right.  Put everything here.  One thing, before break, we were talking about old TV shows and the Honeymooners, you know,  one of these days, pow, to the moon, whatever that quote is.  You couldn't do that on TV anymore.  That's a domestic violence joke.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:50:30]  The Honeymooners, which are classic.  People adore them.  Can you get away with it if you do it in character as Jackie Gleason?  Well, again, Jackie Gleason always had the great writers and stuff.  So, he was able to make it look like she always got the better of him, which she did in the  end.  Mentally, she would just pull him apart.  He would never lay a hand on her.  His character itself, you know, he was the type of guy that would never lay a hand on her.  Yeah, but you explain. 
[02:51:00]  But you couldn't even suggest these days that that.  And he's an endearing, classic character that is beloved by America.  Every holiday, there is a Honeymooners marathon, and we laugh and laugh at this threat of domestic  violence that he makes on his wife on an episode-after-episode basis.  But you couldn't even do that under that context, and it is context.  One of these days, you are going to get yours, and he puts his fist up. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  And watching that clown, you're going to look like Emmett Kelly with that red nose.  Yeah.  He's going to belt her in the nose.  And watching that growing up, it was very innocent.  It really was.  But you can't even suggest that at a pitch meeting.  They would fire you as a comedy writer.  Yeah, so we got this guy, right?  And he's this big, like, fat husband.  And then this thin...  Yeah, he's much bigger than his wife.  Pretty wife.  Sure.  They make the number 10.  They live in a shithole, right?  And he's going to, like, come home, and he's pissed at work, and she's going to say things 
[02:52:00]  to him, and he's going to threaten to punch her in the face and hit her so hard that she's  going to fly to the moon.  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  Why are you all leaving the pitch meeting?  This is great stuff.  They call security and escort you to the front door.  And it's called Lucky Louie.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, well.  Teasing, of course.  It was an homage.  Yes.  I liked the whole set and everything.  No couch.  Completely that. 
[02:52:30]  Yes, no couch.  Oh, Cave Dudes could do it, though.  Thank you.  Cave Dudes.  Thank you, James.  I cannot wait for Cave Dudes.  He's going to go, I'm going to hit you with this club.  Yeah.  That's right.  And then there'll be no outrage.  To the magic light in the sky.  To the magic light in the sky.  You know, because he doesn't know what a moon is.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is.  Excuse me.  That's a car wreck.  Cave Dudes are taking a page out of cartoons.  So you could get away with murder if you're a cartoon. 
[02:53:00]  And now you can get away with murder if you're a cave dude.  Caveman.  Or caveman is called.  Yeah, but the cave dudes.  Funny.  That's all you need to know, Jim.  Funny.  Cave Dudes.  So I'm telling you, I've been saying for a while, we've got to turn ourselves into cartoon  characters, or maybe now we're Cave Dudes.  How does it start?  What's the opening scene of the Caveman show?  Is it one of them in front of a mirror tying his tie?  It's got to be doing something civilized.  So we'll be like, look, a caveman's putting on a tie. 
[02:53:30]  Honey, get in here.  You don't want to miss this.  Drop what you're doing and get in here.  It's hilarious.  Put on your laughing hat.  Cave Dudes putting on a tie.  Look at him tying his bright white tennis shoes.  Like a person.  But yet he won't shave.  He's smarter than the regular people.  And a lot classier.  But he's a caveman.  Covered in hair.  I think they live in a real apartment.  Or a cave. 
[02:54:00]  Will they live in a cave?  No, it's got to be a real apartment.  But would it be a cave with like windows in it?  Like Fred Flintstone's house.  It's the live action Flintstones.  It's a caveman.  It's brilliant.  Oh, it's got to be funny.  But some special interest group will definitely find some angle on why this should not be on TV.  Can I say that not only do I hope it doesn't do well, but I hope after the first episode shows, there's just a big fire at the network.  Know what's going to happen with cave dudes? 
[02:54:30]  Massive ratings and then drops off the chart.  Boy, you think everyone's going to tune in and go, I love those commercials.  Because as a society, we're that dumb.  Well, sheep in general, we're that dumb.  We will take a peek at cave dudes.  Hey, Boathead Jim is on the line.  Not Boathead Jim.  Jim, can you hold on?  Because I've got to take a leak.  Much more important than your sad story.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, Boathead Jim, hold on for a little while, okay? 
[02:55:00]  We have a little while more.  We want to talk to you.  All right.  Yeah, I'm hanging, dude.  I'm sure you are.  Boathead Jim was hitting the head with a boat years ago.  Well, we'll explain to the new listeners after the break, because now you start something  and then I'm going to pee my pants.  But I teased it, Opie.  I teased it.  Oh, let's hear your tease.  We'll talk with Boathead Jim in a little while.  A few years ago, Boathead Jim was hitting the head with a boat.  We'll tell you about it after these words.  Oh, no.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  Hey, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Brian Regan.  Jolly Murphy.  Hey, this is Christopher Knight. 
[02:55:30]  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, this is Adrian Curry's set.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're not.  You're a communist.  The Valerius.  You're a communist.  All right, we got Boathead Jim on the line here. 
[02:56:00]  We haven't talked to Boathead Jim in a while.  Long time.  Man, you think your life sucks.  Just imagine Boathead Jim and his story.  I guess he was in one boat.  I think he was doing some boating himself in another boat.  Well, let's have Boathead Jim tell.  We haven't had him on the air in over a year, maybe longer. 
[02:56:30]  I think longer.  Boathead Jim.  Hey, guys, I can't even hear you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You lost your hearing.  You're wearing a boat for a hat.  Is it getting worse?  Take that Evan Root out of your head, out of your ears.  Out of your head.  How do you say you have a boat motor in his head?  I don't.  Why don't you tell everybody your story? 
[02:57:00]  I was hitting the head by a boat and knocked out and put him in a coma.  Yeah, so you were on a boat.  Give us kind of the story.  You're on the boat.  Everyone's having fun.  You're assuming that we remember your life story.  We barely remember your name, sir.  Do you live in the water and some fishermen were in your area and you were trying to headbutt the boat and knock them over?  Is that what happened?  No.  No, of course not.  You're on a boat.  I was on a boat. 
[02:57:30]  So it starts with a boat, right?  We were heading downstream and the steering mechanism on our boat broke, making our boat deer sharper to the left into the front of another boat.  That boat kept flying up from behind down from the back end of our boat.  And the bow of that boat or the point struck me directly in the back of the head and immediately knocked me out and put him in a coma.  How long were you in a coma for?  Three years.  Three years he was in a coma.  Wait, I didn't remember that.  You were in a coma for three years? 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  He didn't either.  Dude, you were out for three years?  Damn, my tongue is too frozen from this smoothie.  Wait.  I got frozen tongue.  I can't talk.  When you came out of it, you probably thought it was the next day, right?  I don't even remember.  Oh, good.  I was all psyched to talk to you.  Yeah, you don't remember the accident, right?  I don't remember anything.  I don't even remember coming out of the coma.  It's just all...  Oh, you don't remember even that.  I don't think he remembers his life before.  I think people had to kind of tell him, right? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, my mom told me everything.  It's not like the movies where you come out of a coma and you remember it and everything.  See, I was actually joking.  I do remember you, Boathead Jim.  And the one thing that I'm noticing, it seems like you're a little more with it since the  last time we talked.  Is that possible?  Yeah, why?  You still go to the doctor?  Are you doing rehab, new drugs?  Because something seems different.  It seems like you're a little more with it.  No, I got a job. 
[02:59:00]  A little more focused.  We're just dumber?  Probably.  No?  I got a job and life is great.  Oh, you got a job?  Yeah, full-time job.  You've been looking for a girl, though.  That was like your thing, right?  Yeah, I was looking for a girl.  How's that working out?  It's not.  It's just...  I gave up.  Well, Dennis Hoff is coming by soon.  Oh.  You could always get one of those wood-carved girls on the front of a boat.  Yeah.  What's your job there, Boat?  No arms.  A bust. 
[02:59:30]  A bust.  I work for an aerospace defense company.  A what?  An aerospace defense company.  You work for an aerospace defense company?  As a recycling engineer.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  You know what's going on?  I think Mommy just put you in front of a video game and said you're at work.  Put him, like, in front of an F-18 fighter game?  Right.  You work for an aerospace company, sweetie.  You're traffic control.  Sorry, Boathead Jim. 
[03:00:00]  And a character known as Boathead Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You sticking to the script we gave you, Boathead Jim?  Because, you know, you're a made-up person.  Yeah.  Yeah, nah, I'm teasing, of course.  All right, so...  Boathead Jim, so you work for...  In recycling in the aerospace industry.  Correct.  What does that entail?  I walk around and pick up 500 great cans of recycle, and I put it in one bin, and then 
[03:00:30]  I take that bin, and I empty it into a compactor.  All right.  Hey, Jim.  That's an honest day's work.  I'm going to ask you something.  What did you want to be when you were growing up?  I wanted to be a professional skier.  Skier?  Oh, a skier?  Yeah, I was really good at skiing.  That's kind of a silly thing to want to be.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, that's something you do as a hobby.  No, I won a competition in 1989, and right after that competition, I was sent information 
[03:01:00]  from Steam Red Springs, Colorado, and wanted me to go out and ski my high school career  for the Winter Olympics and for Nagamo in 1992.  What?  You're kidding.  So you were already, like, on your way to becoming a great skier, or a good skier, and  Olympic skier?  Yeah.  And then you had this boating accident.  That's why I cursed God.  Why would you allow that memory to continue?  Yeah, if any memory should have been repressed, it's that one.  Yeah, how about you knock that memory out of the kid's head and save him some grief? 
[03:01:30]  I know.  You're just like, I was hanging out smoking pot in high school.  That's all I remember.  Right.  You know?  Let him remember getting blown once, and then the next thing you know, he's waking up.  That's it.  Right.  Oh, that's a goddamn shame.  Do you still ski at all?  No.  Last time I skied, I can't.  It was bad.  I blew out my knee, because I couldn't see the hill right and everything.  Your vision is kind of screwy, too? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my vision is whack.  Really?  I'm getting downright depressed.  Oh, yeah.  I see about three-quarters blind.  Three-quarters blind.  Is it a darkness thing, a blurry thing?  What is it?  It's blurry.  Everything's blurry.  So everything's blurry, huh?  What years were you out?  What years were you in a coma?  From 89 to 91.  Yeah, you didn't miss much.  Nah.  That music kind of sucked.  It was the beginning of grunge, so.  You missed the end of the hairband.  Yeah, you missed the end of the hairband. 
[03:02:30]  Whenever they had their lighters in the air.  It's not that bad.  The power ballad.  If you had to.  You missed the power ballad.  I'll tell you one thing.  I wish I was in a coma in 1989.  Oh, that's when I got married.  Jesus Christ.  If anyone should have been hit on the back of the head with a boat, it was me.  It should have been you.  Exactly.  Wow.  Hey, so.  That stinks, dude.  But then again, here's the thing.  You probably should be dead.  Ship happens, he says.  Ship happens.  You know, because it was a boat. 
[03:03:00]  Okay.  Ship happens.  Jimmy loves the worst ones.  I love Jimmy.  Ship happens.  Ship happens.  Oh, my God.  Life is old, my friend.  I'm sorry, man.  We're just being stern with you.  I know.  It's fine.  I'm going to eat to it.  That's fine.  Why don't you bow down?  Hey, listen.  Hey, listen.  Hey, I got to tell you. 
[03:03:30]  You probably should be dead, correct?  I died three times when I went to the hospital.  Wow.  In the air, in the helicopter.  Oh.  So, Opus is saying he's getting depressed, but I'm saying, like, it does suck.  But on the other side, you probably, if life was fair, you would have been killed in that  moment.  So, like, even though it's not, like, what you want, this is, like, you kind of survived death.  Wah, you guys.  Wah.  Ah, bite me.  What?  What?  Bite me, dude.  That's bullshit.  It should have never happened, but.  It should have never happened. 
[03:04:00]  No, I'm not saying it should have happened.  What I'm saying is.  He's more with it.  I'm trying, I'm trying to say that if you're looking at it like, well, all right, well,  this sucks, but, like, most people have that accent that they're dead.  So, everything I've experienced after that, I got lucky with anyway.  I don't think so.  No, he'd rather be fucking walking around like a regular Joe.  Well, it's like that lady with the car accent when her fucking head came off and went  back on.  Life for her is going to be different now, but most people that have that accent are dead.  You know what, though?  This is refreshing.  Let me tell you something, Boathead Jim. 
[03:04:30]  You are an honest, refreshing gentleman, because a lot of times you hear from people and they  go, I just, you know, I went through it and I count my blessings that I'm even here  and stuff.  And Jim is saying, you know, fuck that.  I want to ski.  I want to get girls.  I want to drive.  I don't want to fucking see blurry.  You know, you're right.  You got dealt a shit hand, Jim.  You got dealt a 2-7.  You got a 2-7 offsuit.  You were the first fucking person who said that to me, that I got dealt a shit hand, 
[03:05:00]  and I did.  You did.  That sucks.  Thanks, Doc.  Do you have friends?  Are you in therapy?  You would like to give us a little update.  Yeah, I went to therapy for about 13 years, and then they finally discharged me.  They said, you're good.  You're good.  Yeah, and I am.  I got a good head on my shoulders.  I came, my mom, my mom and dad are great people, and they helped me out a lot. 
[03:05:30]  That's good that you got both parents that are cool with you.  Right.  That's like, you know, supportive.  What about friends?  I have 500 friends at work.  At work.  In the aerospace firm.  What about, you go out?  You do things?  Do you bowl?  Is there anything you do?  Well, yeah, I just went to New York on Saturday, but I was with work.  No, that was all in town. 
[03:06:00]  They told you it was New York?  Absolutely.  That's terrible.  There's the Empire State Building.  It's some old iron mill.  Yeah, it should have been shut down for years.  Hey, Boathead.  Yeah.  What are your dreams like?  I don't dream.  I haven't dreamed since.  Really?  Yeah, I don't dream.  You just go to sleep and it's just darkness until you wake up?  Yeah.  And you're up?  That's boring.  Yeah, now I'm boring.  Come on.  Something has to be going on.  I don't mean you're boring.  I mean, not dreaming is boring.  I haven't dreamed ever. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe you don't remember it.  Yeah, maybe it happens and you don't remember it.  Yeah, you dream.  Maybe not.  Maybe that part of his head got conked right out.  Maybe.  You want to play in the poker tournament Saturday?  Where?  Atlantic City.  Yeah, I would love to play in the poker tournament.  I'd love to meet Boathead Jim.  How are we going to get you there, though?  I don't know.  I live in Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania.  All right.  Where in Pennsylvania?  Like west, middle, or east? 
[03:07:00]  No.  Near King of Precious.  All right.  That's kind of on the...  Isn't that like Philly area?  Oscar's Philly?  Yeah, you're kind of east side of the state?  Yeah, I'm on the east side.  Yeah, okay.  It's not too far.  Can't we hook him up or something?  I'd like to meet Boathead Jim.  Let's try to get Boathead Jim on the poker.  And by meet Boathead Jim, it doesn't mean I want to hang out with Boathead Jim all fucking night.  You got me?  Why?  How does it mix up?  I don't know. 
[03:07:30]  Watch.  If you annoy me, you'll become slot machine head Jim.  If you annoy me.  How ironic, the hotel that is being held at.  Yeah, you don't want to hang out at the Show Boat Hotel and Casino there.  Oh, no.  Yeah, maybe.  No, not the Show Boat.  No.  It is.  The place looks like a giant paddle boat.  Oh.  Oh, you're going to get flashbacks.  Yeah, I'd like to have Boathead Jim involved in the poker game. 
[03:08:00]  Just don't get three kings and two sixes.  Okay.  No, I'm going to have to.  Because people will say, look what he's got.  I don't know.  A full house?  Yeah.  Well, there's another term for that.  Isn't there?  A full boat.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  A boat.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm... 
[03:08:30]  You're terrible.  Why?  The guy was hitting the head with a boat.  I know.  He's two hours outside AC.  Two hours outside?  That's not that bad.  Brian from St. Louis in the Pet from Minaki style.  Boathead's story about no dreams.  Sounds a little fishy.  Fishy.  Get a bad river card.  Oh, that's right.  He's going to have to deal with the river card.  Well, we don't know... 
[03:09:00]  You ever play Hold'em there?  And not like holding your head and going, ow.  Yeah, I play Hold'em.  Yeah?  You have?  All right.  Yeah, I want Boathead Jim to join us.  Well, we've got to find a way to get him there.  Someone's suggesting hookers.  Would your parents allow hookers in your house?  Probably not.  I don't know.  He chuckled at the idea, though, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I asked.  You're going to get there. 
[03:09:30]  It sounds like not everything is not working.  Boathead Jim wants to give someone a good buggering.  See, we found something that makes him happy.  It still works, obviously, huh?  Yes, it does.  Aha.  And what do you do to, you know, relieve?  Uh, I haven't.  Well, I guess the last time I did it was, um, um, last, was Friday night in the shower. 
[03:10:00]  Ah, there you go.  You've got to take care of business.  Yeah.  You've got to take care of business.  How old the guy are you there, Boathead?  I'm 33.  He's 33.  And in the shower, what were you thinking about as you were, uh, relieving yourself?  Hmm.  Uh, can't say.  Why not?  Because, um, um, um, it's...  It's twisted?  It's on a different channel.  You were thinking of Oprah?  No.  It's on a different channel? 
[03:10:30]  No.  Please.  On a different, on a different satellite system.  Oh, really?  Martha Stewart?  No.  Robin Quivers?  No.  No.  Um, we're trying to think.  What's going on over there?  You probably don't know her because she's on Playboy Radio.  Oh, Playboy Radio.  Okay.  Uh, who?  We talked to a few of those broads.  Yeah.  Those broads.  See them chicks?  Andrea Lowe?  Oh.  Oh, I know her.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  So you're thinking of her?  When you, when you, when you fantasize about a woman in your head, is she clear or is it  blurry like your vision?  And I'm serious about that.  It's clear?  It's clear, yeah.  So you can see her crystal clear and you know it all the...  Yeah.  Because now it's been years since you've actually been able to see a nude woman even in a picture  clearly, right?  Well, I can see, I can see things, um, 10 feet, up to 10 feet, like clear.  And then after that, everything works. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  How annoying is that?  You got to tape the fucking magazine to the other end of the living room and jack off  to the, I think, 10 feet away?  No, you have to be close, 10 feet or farther, he can't see.  Yeah.  Oh, you could, you could see, like, if you're holding a newspaper, you could read it?  Yeah.  Well, not a newspaper.  Newspaper print's too small.  Oh.  You can watch a porno.  Uh, yeah, I can, but I have to sit right on top of my TV.  All right, 10 feet.  That's got to be a little creepy to see.  Yeah, really?  Imagine that right on top of it?  Nope. 
[03:12:00]  He means, like, figuratively speaking.  He's a roddy, he's better reception.  God damn.  How can we make that happen?  Oh, we got a couple of people that can take you.  Really?  Where?  Uh, Steve and Jersey.  What the fuck?  Jason and PA.  What the fuck?  A couple of people want to take Boathead Jim.  All right.  Uh, Steve and Jersey.  Hey, guys, good morning.  Um, I just wanted to offer transportation for Boathead Jim.  I could gladly go get him.  Why are you laughing? 
[03:12:30]  Uh, because you guys will crack me up.  What do you mean you could probably go get him?  We need, like, a definite.  No, no, I definitely, I definitely could.  With your permission, I'll go get him.  Well, that'd be kind of cool.  Yeah, I got a new, brand new Honda Odyssey.  Plenty of room.  Yeah, you're not going to hold his nose shut until he suffocates, are you?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow, that's a good way to go.  Wait, now you guys are scaring me.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  Yeah, right.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[03:13:00]  Let's see Jason and PA.  Jason, what's up?  Why are you laughing?  I'm not laughing.  Oh, easy.  Hey, I'm in Lancaster.  I can pick his ass up.  You're in Lancaster?  I don't like his attitude.  I don't either.  He might be, well, no, wait, he might.  Horse and buggy?  Lancaster.  Horse and buggy?  Yeah, that's Amish country.  Isn't that where the Amish are?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's up there.  It's going to take a while to get to Atlantic City in a horse and buggy, my friend.  Yeah, I got two horses, buddy. 
[03:13:30]  All right, let's go to Eric.  Eric, you're close to King of Prussia?  He's probably close to that guy in Lancaster.  I'm outside of the city.  I'm in Fairless Hills.  I'm probably 20 minutes from King of Prussia.  All right, we got to get him a ride.  Yeah.  We got to hook him up.  What time does this tournament start?  Do you know?  9 a.m.?  Noon, maybe.  I think noon.  Yeah, I think noon on Saturday.  Noon on Saturday, showboat, hotel, and casino.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I... 
[03:14:00]  We can smell these people.  We need someone that's like a guarantee.  That's absolutely...  All right, Steve, we go back to you.  Yes, sir.  You could definitely get Boathead Gym there?  Absolutely.  No problem.  For the day to check out poker, maybe even be in the tournament?  Yes, sure.  I can't play poker.  I have no idea how to do it.  So, you know, as far as hanging around and getting in your way, you won't have to worry  about that with me.  Well, Anthony has a double room suite, so you guys can crash in one room.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
[03:14:30]  Just come up to my room and...  Yeah.  Well, should we have the guys figure it out behind the scenes?  All right, Boathead, we're going to give you, like, tickets to the poker tournament.  Okay.  Tickets, courtesy of paltalk.com, the only place to see our show live from the studio.  Why don't we do this?  And then we've got Steve on the line.  Let's see if we can hook these two up.  Let's put these guys on hold.  Steve, you're not gay, right?  No, sir.  No, I'm married.  Two children.  Happy.  You're not going to make Jim blow you for a ride, are you? 
[03:15:00]  No.  I'm just kidding.  Come on.  And I need a ride home, and that...  Obviously.  I do need a ride home.  Oh, I'll give you a ride home, too.  No problem.  Okay.  Jason from Ride.  Don't get him a ride.  Get him a pair of glasses so he can see farther than 10 feet away.  10 feet.  You think that's all it was?  You don't have to do with the boat.  You just needed glasses?  Right.  Parents were just trying to save the 200 bucks.  Oh.  Why don't we put these guys on hold so they can, through our screener, exchange phone 
[03:15:30]  numbers, and then they can hook up a ride.  There's a guy named PJ Pickett from King of Prussia.  He says that he has a decent car.  I'm not looking to play, but I can help out a fellow neighbor.  PJ, what about maybe sending your number as well?  We'll figure it out.  That's on instant feedback.  All right, Steve, hold on the line.  Okay.  And Boathead, Jim, anything else?  No, that's all.  I was just checking in.  I didn't even expect to go to the Stoker Tour to me. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, we get you to Atlantic City.  Have some fun.  Get a night out of town, right?  Are your parents cool with this?  Probably.  I don't know.  You're 33.  You're 33.  You tell them to go fuck themselves.  And even if they say, have fun, say, go fuck yourself.  And walk out.  Exactly.  And take the car and drive it 10 feet.  Walk out like Mr. Magoo, just trying to figure it out.  Or slam the door real hard and breathe in the fresh air and realize you just walked in.  Hey, Boathead, you can drive, but you can only see 10 feet in front of you. 
[03:16:30]  Leave today.  That's dangerous.  God damn.  That must be, like, kind of scary driving with people.  Hello?  What happened?  Boathead.  Boathead.  Yes.  Yeah, that must be scary driving with people, like, being in the passenger seat and not being 
[03:17:00]  able to, like, kind of see what's going on.  I guess.  I mean, I lived 18 years with it, so sorry.  That's true.  You've been with this a long time.  Do you smoke pot?  No.  No dope?  You drink at all?  Yeah, I drink every night.  If I was you, I would drink like a fish.  Oh, really?  I don't drink like a fish.  I only have, like, one or two. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, one or two.  Catch a little buzz.  One actually gets me buzzed.  Two gets me hammered.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  All right, Boathead.  All right, Boathead.  Well, hold on the line.  We'll take your information down, and we'll see you down in Atlantic City.  It was good hearing from you.  It sounds like you're doing all right there.  Yeah, I'm doing all right.  I'm telling you, I hear a difference in your voice.  It sounds like, I don't know. 
[03:18:00]  I don't know.  It sounds like you're a little more with it than the last time we talked.  Well, thanks.  All right, Boathead.  Definitely.  We'll see you in Atlantic City, okay?  You got it, guys.  All right.  Hey, PJ, that's his number, too.  That might help.  Okay.  Or is that other guy legit?  Because now I want Boathead Jim there.  This guy's from King of Prussia.  Could live really close to him.  Whose cell phone is it?  PJ.  I asked him to send out in some feedback.  He did.  It's right there.  All right.  Good old Boathead.  It's been a while.  Take another break.  When we get back, the BBC versus a Scientologist or Scientology. 
[03:18:30]  BBC reporter, John Sweeney, talks to Scientology spokesperson.  Okay, Tommy Davis, and pisses him off.  Oh, I saw footage of them.  They're, like, nose-to-nose, young and young.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, they just lose it.  We'll do that next.  I've got stupid in stereo.  The OPNM in the show.  All are gone, all but one. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Literally.  All right, BBC versus Scientology.  This is some terrific audio that came in.  Got this BBC reporter, John Sweeney, talks to a Scientology spokesperson named Tommy Davis  and pisses him off.  Some people say it's a sinister cult.  Now, L. Ron Hubbard, some people say that he's a fantasist.  He's using the some people say in England.  Some people say.  People are saying. 
[03:19:30]  Who are these people?  People are saying it's a cult.  Some people.  Well, I guess some people do, but.  Oh.  Hi, Sam.  Sam's in here.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good, how are you?  All right.  What do you need?  Well, I'm just going to come in in case you needed help with the audio.  Oh.  Thank you.  It's on YouTube.  Just search.  All right.  Here we go.  I'll see you get the video.  Some people say it's a sinister cult.  Now, L. Ron Hubbard, some people say that he's a fantasist and a liar. 
[03:20:00]  I want to just go back to this.  I want to just go back to this.  You see, I would just like to, and I hope somebody is shooting this.  Okay, good.  Well, there's actually, to be fair, there's one camera in front of him, you see, one camera  from your...  No, you listen to me for a second, please.  You have no right whatsoever to say what and what isn't a religion.  The Constitution of the United States of America guarantees one's right to practice  and believe freely in this country, and the definition of religion is very clear, and  it's not defined by John Sweeney, and for you to repeatedly refer to my faith in those 
[03:20:30]  terms is so derogatory, so offensive, and so bigoted, and the reason you keep repeating  it is because you wanted to get a reaction like you're getting right now.  Well, buddy, you got it.  Right here, right now.  Well, I'm angry, real angry.  Very good.  So we're done, because if you use that term one more time to describe my religion...  We're not done.  ...I can't be responsible for my actions.  Now, my friend, it is your turn to listen to...  Wow. 
[03:21:00]  What term did he use?  A cult.  He said it's a cult, and L. Ron Hubbard is like a fantasy, or lived in a fantasy land  kind of a thing.  The guy didn't sound all that tough.  Listen to me, buddy.  Now you got a problem.  Now you got me.  My dander's up.  A tool.  That guy was pissed.  What did he...  Well, now the reporter's like, all right, well, then let's play.  It's go time.  It's go time.  What evidence, Sean Lonsdale, do you have that people have been tortured? 
[03:21:30]  Oh, Tommy...  You didn't do that.  Oh, no, hold a second, Tommy.  No, no, no, stop there, Tommy.  No, I'm not stopping here.  You listen to me for a second.  You're accusing members of my religion of engaging in brain...  No, Tommy, you stop now.  No, listen to me.  You were not there at the beginning of that interview.  You were not there.  You did not hear or record all of the interviews.  Do you understand?  Brainwashing is a power against humanity.  You are quoting the second half of the interview, not the first half. 
[03:22:00]  You cannot assert what you're saying.  No, do you listen to me?  That was like John Cleese in Fawlty Towers or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yelling at Manuel.  What the hell was that?  Oh, it's the little servant.  I remember Fawlty Towers.  That show is great.  But that's where we're different.  I didn't remember the name of the characters. 
[03:22:30]  Holy shit.  That guy's angry.  Yo!  Yo will listen to me!  What does the other guy look like?  Is he a...  I don't know.  Kind of a little guy?  Is he a little guy or is he a big guy?  He's a little guy.  That's the English dude?  Yeah.  He definitely looks like something out of the wall. 
[03:23:00]  John Sweeney going mad in the BBC.  Going mad.  Scientology and me.  Oh my god.  He's a little guy.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  He's wearing...  He looks like a secret agent.  Yeah.  It's like the type of guy you would throw a chocolate-covered strawberry at his shoes.  Oh.  It's true.  That's cool.  Oh, I hate it.  One for the old-timer.  That's another thing we were talking about earlier about the media and there's so many blogs 
[03:23:30]  and everyone's got a point and an opinion on everything.  Scientology used to really prosecute anybody that said anything derogatory about him.  Go after him full bore because it was usually just the news or whoever had the public ear.  You know?  Now, there's so many people out there and so many outlets that you could pretty much say  anything you want.  Isn't it since it became a religion, too?  It seems like they're not going after you as hard because it's a religion. 
[03:24:00]  It's been a religion for pretty long.  Were they prosecuting people after it was a religion?  Yeah.  It wasn't so much prosecuting.  They were really intimidating people with lawsuits about if you criticize them.  They would kind of shut you down and threaten you with lawsuits.  But now anybody who wants to goof on them can because the likes of John Travolta, Tom Cruise,  they come off a little wacky sometimes.  Is she one of those?  Is she really?  It surprises me sometimes when you're like, there's something. 
[03:24:30]  Isaac Hayes.  Well.  Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel is a Scientologist?  Yes.  Interesting.  Yes.  News reporter from News 12 in West Palm loses script and flubs through story.  Uh-oh.  This is what you're counting on, by the way, when you watch your news program.  You think these people actually know what they're talking about, but they're just news readers.  And if the news reading machine breaks down, the machine is broken.  What do we do?  Then there's some serious problems. 
[03:25:00]  A local man spots something suspicious and that he decides to spring into action.  He has done something that is very good.  Unfortunately, it's the police.  You dick.  You dick.  See, these are the people we're counting on.  Your teleprompter broke.  There you go.  What do we do now?  He did something good.  That is hysterical.  He turns into Brian Regan. 
[03:25:30]  Vol, what will we do?  Vol put fruit on the trees.  A local man spots something suspicious and that he decides to spring into action.  He has done something that is very good.  Port St. Lucie police need to know if you have seen anything of the man who exposed himself to several women and children.  They released this composite sketch.  The picture was cockle.  They got him back on track, though. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, God.  Done something good and good.  It's a good thing.  That was good.  I'm an idiot.  Oh, teleprompter's back.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm all smooth now, and I'll tell you the news like I know what I'm talking about.  I'm Joe News Guy.  Ass good.  Expose them all.  Oof.  Done something.  That was such a great...  You just saw the breakdown.  Snow coat.  Snow cone.  And now with sports, I don't know your name. 
[03:26:30]  It's not on the teletype thing.  All right.  We like that, too.  Girly man's, what, crying in jail?  Well, I guess he gets out today, and then now it's tax evasion time.  Tax evasion time?  Is that what they're going to get him on?  He's got to go to Nevada.  Nevada, right?  Yeah, we're talking about the Girls Gone Wild dude.  Girls Gone Wild.  And supposedly it came out that he was crying every day in jail. 
[03:27:00]  He only had to do 33 days.  That's all he got?  I think jail will be tough on Prissy Parrish.  You should see what it's doing to her beefy ex-boy toy, Girls Gone Wild founder, Joe Francis.  Yes, the millionaire, Mamory Magnet, has been crying like a little girl every day.  He's been in a Florida slam.  TMZ.com, citing sources in the Panama City Jail, reported that a death row inmate had been taunting Francis to the point that he's been breaking down in his cell since being jailed 33 days ago. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, here's some audio of him crying in prison.  Oh, mother fucker.  Well, that sounds sordid. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  So he's crying.  I think he did get out today, and now he has to go to Nevada.  He was in for contempt, I guess.  Oh, did they bust him on underage girls?  No, no, no.  They've been trying to get him for all sorts of things.  Yeah, they've been trying for years to get him on underage girls, things like that.  Girls that have turned around and said, hey, I didn't agree to this.  How did they not get him on that?  Did they video them signing the contracts?  Yeah, I think so.  There was some reason why he didn't get prosecuted for that, but I have no idea what it is, and I just added nothing to that conversation. 
[03:28:30]  There was some reason.  Don't know.  Don't know what it was.  Here it is.  Francis pleaded guilty to contempt of court in late April.  He had failed, excuse me, as ordered by a federal judge to settle a suit from seven women who were minors when he filmed them for Girls Gone Wild, which has earned him tens of millions of dollars.  Dollars.  Well, you know something?  You can say what you want, but a prison looks like a scary place.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  I'd probably cry myself to sleep there, too.  You've got to start fighting the minute you get there.  That's what I'd probably do.  Yeah.  That's a good way to end up getting out.  Dead.  What are you going to do?  You've got to find, let me tell you what you've got to do.  You've got to find the biggest guy in the yard.  The biggest guy, right?  And you step up to him, and then you just bash him right in the face.  And then you look around and go, anyone else?  That's what you do.  Almost like they're all going to look and go, this kid's tough.  No.  He's going to shank you, and then he's going to push your face in the dirt, and he's going  to insert himself into your butthole. 
[03:29:30]  Your butthole.  I couldn't say butthole.  And he's going to brutalize you for your fucking sassiness.  That never works.  Of course.  No.  I think you've got to.  I don't know anything about prison.  Never been.  Don't want to ever, ever, ever go.  But I would think you've got to lay low.  That's what I say.  Lay low.  Just do your time.  Shut your mouth, and don't be alone.  How do you do that?  Why do people in the movies, like in Shawshank, why do you go to that part of the laundry room 
[03:30:00]  that was empty?  Why would you walk in there?  I would hang out with the group.  I'd like to be able to say Jimmy Norton didn't get taken.  Guys, we're trying to get off of Iraq, but we've got some intel coming in.  Oh.  Chris in Vegas, what's up?  Hey, I'm doing the Extreme Fat Smash Diet, and on page 20, it says that you can start  at any time, not on Monday.  I just heard that.  Did you hear him? 
[03:30:30]  I heard outside.  Uh-oh.  What was he just eating, by the way?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I got a book.  Bring me a book.  E to the R.  Yeah, E-Rock said that, E-Rock, it says that you can start on any day.  The Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  The Extreme Fat Smash.  Any day.  Get a microphone.  No, that's what this guy's saying.  Oh, oh, look at him.  He's going out.  He's getting the book.  He wants to, let me see the book.  Clear his name.  E-Rock, let me see the book.  And then there's dinner plate.  Ah!  Goddammit. 
[03:31:00]  Sorry there, Jim.  Should have let you hit it back to me.  No, it's all right.  I'm playing catch with myself.  Chris, what page?  It's page 20.  It's like the third paragraph now?  All right.  Do not skip meals.  It is very important that you eat the four smaller meals each day.  Also, don't worry about starting the first day of a cycle on a Monday.  In fact, many people refer to start the program so that the two-a-day workout periods fall on a weekend.  I strongly recommend keeping the days in the order that I've written them.  So you don't have to start on a Monday. 
[03:31:30]  Not only do you not have to start on a Monday, it recommends you don't.  All right.  Pleasure now.  Hey, thank you.  Boy, there's always people out there to rat you out, E-Rock.  Reading the book just to find some kind of problem with you.  Yeah, that's just amazing what this has become.  Think how many books he sold just for people that want to read it to fuck over E-Rock.  Right.  Well, what did you say?  Why did you say Monday?  You said the book told you to start on a Monday.  Yeah.  Where?  Where's that?  Well, we read it on Friday, going through it, saying Monday and then doing your heavy exercise days on the weekends. 
[03:32:00]  But why did you say it?  You said to start on a Monday.  We're all confused.  You said the book said to start on a Monday.  All right.  I had it wrong.  But when we read it, I was like, all right, we'll do it Monday.  Fine.  And that's when we started that clip.  E-Rock gets so pissed.  But look, man.  It's right in the book.  It's right.  And you were getting your whole defense.  The other day.  The entire defense the other day of ordering that steak was the fact that the book said to start on Monday. 
[03:32:30]  So that kind of cleared you.  Why?  No.  Now, get it out, son.  Calm down.  Take a breath.  Take a breath.  Take a breath.  I'm not good.  No crying and fat smashing.  Let's go.  No.  All right.  The book from when you started had nothing to do with the dinner from Sunday.  All right.  I thought you said, though, that the book said to start on Monday.  So that's why you were able to order that steak.  No.  That wasn't why I was able to order the steak.  I ordered the steak because they didn't have the salmon. 
[03:33:00]  And everything else comes in a heavy cream or a sauce.  So the steak looked like it was going to be, like, the best thing I could get off there.  Why weren't you on the diet, though, by then?  Why did you say you had to start on Monday?  Because we just, I don't know.  My girlfriend said, all right, we're going to start this Monday, and they're in the book.  Okay, fine.  That's what we did.  What?  What?  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  So wait a minute.  First it was Dr. Smith, but now it's your girlfriend.  Who wrote this book?  I don't know.  I'd be an ass of myself. 
[03:33:30]  Wow.  Look, like I said, this show is unscripted.  We didn't even know we were going to have you in today.  That call came out of nowhere.  The guy just wants to, you know, start trouble with you.  What do you have to say to that guy and everyone else that's...  I just still don't understand the start on Monday steak thing. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, there's no...  They don't go together.  The start on Monday was when we read the book on Friday, all right?  I obviously had it wrong.  You read the whole book?  But then we questioned you as to why you had a steak on the weekend when you were supposed  to start Fat Smash.  Right.  And you said, well, no, it says to start on a Monday.  Yep.  And that's the only reason you had the steak.  No, that's not the reason I had the steak.  No.  That's what you said.  No, the steak I had to take because they didn't have the fucking salmon and it looked 
[03:34:30]  like the healthiest thing on the menu.  But you ended up having the salmon.  No, they didn't have the salmon.  I ended up having the red snapper.  Oh, the snapper.  The pressure's getting to the kid.  Oh, wow.  He's not eating.  Oh, boy.  He's blood sugar levels low.  He's really freaking out.  He needs to lose this 20 pounds to shut everyone up.  I'm afraid that you're crying now.  No, wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays. 
[03:35:00]  I just want to know why you said you had to start on a Monday.  I'm not even breaking balls.  When we read the book on Friday, that passage that was there, I mistook as starting for Monday  to do the heavy exercise and stuff on the weekends.  What it said there was you don't have to start it on a Monday.  What exercise have you done yesterday?  Yesterday, we were at the gym.  It was two rounds of cardio.  Two?  What's two rounds of cardio mean? 
[03:35:30]  Two rotations of the exercise.  Two.  Hey, that's funny.  He clocked in at 11 feet.  Right.  11 feet and one calorie burn.  I'm going to treat myself to a Mars bar.  Holy shit.  What's two cycles of cardio?  Like one?  About 25 minutes on the treadmill and about 25 minutes on the stage. 
[03:36:00]  A half hour or a second ago.  He just lost.  Didn't he just lose a few minutes?  Lost 10 minutes.  Yeah, because a half hour, two cycles.  That's 10 minutes.  You just say half hours.  Based on day one.  Day one.  Day one.  So you had the salmon.  Why?  I'm really confused.  He got the steak because they didn't have the salmon.  Yes.  They had nothing else.  But how did you know the snapper was there? 
[03:36:30]  I didn't.  When I saw the other person that had it.  Your menu didn't have snapper.  Right.  I didn't see it.  There was a big line through it?  It was there.  I just, I didn't catch it.  I got drawn to steak.  That's the, everything else had some kind of cream.  You didn't catch the Monday's thing.  You didn't catch, you caught steak and Caesar salad.  You didn't catch.  You didn't catch on the menu because that's all his eyes see is bad food.  Yeah.  It avoids.  Steak.  Tiramisu.  I just, I don't know. 
[03:37:00]  I, I don't know.  It just looked to me, or seems to me, that, that, that the steak was probably the last  thing you should have gotten.  All right.  Let's say hi to Raymond in Sacramento.  On the Fat Smash.  Raymond.  But you were starting on Monday.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, what's up?  You know, Dr. Smith actually told him to start that day.  Oh, that's right.  He did say start right away.  Start now.  Well, you could start immediately.  Because you only get 28 days, whatever it is, four weeks. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, I started it the same day to see if I could beat him.  Okay, sweet.  You've got a lot of pressure, Iraq.  So, yeah, but Dr. Smith said start that day.  So, you said, I read the book and it said Monday, but then someone said, no, no, the book  says start any day.  And you're like, yeah, but no, the book.  I thought you said, but then there was, I thought there was no snapper spider.  No, no, no.  I heard him say to get the steak spider.  I looked past the snapper because my eye didn't catch it because it was, I don't know. 
[03:38:00]  How was he?  Hieroglyphics?  We asked Iraq to explain why he, you know, ate that steak that day, which was what, Sunday,  Mother's Day?  And this is what he had to say.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  That's why.  Well, I still don't really grasp.  I'm a little slow today.  I don't grasp the whole why you had the steak.  I'm sorry.  Could we get Ian Smith on the phone?  I would like to ask him. 
[03:38:30]  Didn't he say that?  I just don't.  We're searching for the audience.  Oh, look at Danny's.  Oh, yeah.  He's searching.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Hold on.  What?  Danny's doing a dilette dilette revolution over there.  What happened?  What are you doing?  Do we want Ian on the phone?  No, it's all right.  Iraq just looked at his watch.  Why?  He's looking at the guy just going, please, time.  Hurry.  Don't they have a meeting at 11.30?  Oh, shit.  We do.  Yeah, we do.  We don't have time for this crap? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  I can't find the salmon.  Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  Iraq, sneak out.  What do you want, Iraq?  A hush puppy.  Sneak out.  Got time for that crap.  Sneak out.  Sneak out.  Excuse me.  I have my tender steak on this plate.  By the way, someone has lost 16 pounds in a week.  Rob on Long Island. 
[03:39:30]  Rob.  Yeah, I went on the Fat Smash last Monday.  I went from 290 to 274.  In one week?  One week.  I swear to God, one week.  And meat and sirloin steak is part of the Fat Smash plan, but the size of a deck of cards.  But also, it's not on the first week, is it?  Yes.  It's like meal number one of the four meals you're allowed to have.  Is it?  I don't know.  It says it right there.  Extreme!  Fat Smash.  Extreme.  Is steak fattening?  Yeah.  Is it?  Thank you very much.  I love you guys.  Bye-bye. 
[03:40:00]  Thank you.  What do you want me to do?  You should try to get a lean cut.  Yeah, I prefer it.  I prefer it.  I just leave a cut of meat.  Lean cut.  You're amongst friends.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  All right.  We do have to go.  Yeah.  We almost made it to 11 today.  Line of the day.  Oh, where you got the Dr. Ian Smith?  What?  What?  Oh.  What?  All right.  We'll get it for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Tomorrow.  We can really abuse him.  We can really abuse him tomorrow.  Great.  Did you ever hear such emotion and confusion coming out of a person? 
[03:40:30]  He's the worst excuse maker ever.  I just picture a cop sitting across shaking his head like, I know I'm getting a confession  any minute out of this guy.  No.  No.  Shut up.  A text.  Two and one.  Who's this from?  Two runner-ups and one line of the day.  Oh.  I'm tired.  Thank you.  Sure.  What's that?  I got a text and I was thinking.  Thank you.  That's all.  It's like a big, this whole XM satellite radio thing.  It's my personal like voicemail and stuff. 
[03:41:00]  Hi.  Hello.  Thanks.  That's all.  I know that dude.  Hey, who's here?  Our new intern.  Yeah.  We wrote on him and stuff.  Yep.  Didn't we?  Yep.  Cool.  And point out all his, uh, all the problems areas on him.  Remember?  Oh, really?  Creeps he is.  Remember that?  What?  Get up.  Sam's protege.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That's Sam's protege.  Remember?  Remember him?  Protegé.  I saw him this morning.  I'm like, whoa, he made the cut.  We were just joking about giving you an internship. 
[03:41:30]  What do we do to him again?  I remember we circled.  Bob Kelly took a Sharpie and circled all of the problem areas.  Problem areas on him, including his hairline.  It was everything.  Then we had to interview him.  Oh, Jimmy hasn't met you yet.  Jimmy was on the road.  Look at Jim.  Look at Jim looking at him.  Oh, boy.  His name is Jared because he's got a piece of tape on him that says Jared on it.  This is Sam's protege.  Is it protege?  He used to work for Sam's radio show.  He's not my protege. 
[03:42:00]  He was my intern at my college show.  Oh, right.  Okay.  He was an intern at your college show.  Aren't you an intern in college?  So how could you be an intern for an intern?  Once you have an intern, you don't have to be an intern anymore.  Uh-huh.  Sounds like an E-Rock excuse.  Yeah.  All right.  What's up, Jared?  First day.  So what did we do to the – like Bob Kelly had a problem with your hairline, so he like  drew a – what?  What did he do?  Help us out.  He drew like lines all over my forehead.  Right.  I remember getting my bagger.  But the weird part is what was the problem with your hair? 
[03:42:30]  You got a full head of hair.  Yeah.  He just didn't like the way it sweeps like Dennis the Menace.  He looks – he's got like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Scent of a Woman.  The move is no move, Chad.  Yeah, there was kind of some issues he had with you, I guess.  Your gut.  Did he have a problem with your gut?  Yeah.  What else?  He referred to me as Augustus Gloop.  Augustus Gloop, right.  That was another reference he made.  And you had some kind of interesting story.  What was it?  He's on like some kind of –  Why did we keep you in here for ten minutes? 
[03:43:00]  He's got some drugs in him.  No.  No?  Why the weird look then?  Oh, I was just really nervous.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's all hunched over.  He has that kind of – he has the same vibe as Ali Sheedy in fucking Breakfast Club.  He's trying to make it snow with his hair.  Nah.  No.  Breakfast Club was a terrific movie.  Yeah.  To him, that's a classic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're all fucking – what's that other junior high school kid running around here? 
[03:43:30]  What's his name?  Oh, Matt Damon.  She's Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Oh, don't show Jimmy this kid.  What's this kid?  Yeah, you're going to love him.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, how you doing?  Not bad.  Right from Abercrombie and Fitch, California.  Jesus.  How you doing, sir?  Well, obviously, Steve's getting the guy still, huh?  Yeah.  So, 10th grade?  Oh, thank you.  Or 11th.  No, I get that out.  No, I know.  I'm sure you do.  How old are you?  21 next month.  21 next month?  Maybe 20. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, Sam, you've got to see the way he walks.  Why?  No.  He's got a strut about him.  I injured him a couple days ago lifting, and I've kind of had a little swagger.  Lifting.  Yeah.  Of course.  It's working out.  That makes your head bop when you walk?  All right, let's see you walk.  Let's see you.  Now it's going to be hard.  Walk back and forth.  Try to walk as naturally as possible.  As naturally as possible?  Yeah.  Let's give it a whirl here.  I saw it when he got up.  I saw it.  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I just...  Does he really walk like that? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  I saw him walking to CBS without me this morning by himself, and I could tell it was him from  30 yards away because his head was bopping like that.  I said, wow, you're kind of walking.  It's a very confident walk.  You are a confident guy.  Thank you.  You got the confident walk.  Yeah.  Well, he should be.  Why not?  Happy to be here.  In turn, on the Opie and Anthony show.  He's puke.  Could have a...  I'm just saying.  What college are you from?  Could last for a week.  What?  Oh, okay. 
[03:45:00]  You got a girlfriend?  No, not right now, unfortunately.  Does Steve make any remarks that are unpleasant?  Not yet.  I'm still waiting.  We require tank tops that are a size too small here.  I'd be happy to tutor you at home.  And we believe in physical discipline.  He's like a ship's captain.  I have to deal out the discipline.  That's right.  You're a belly warmer.  No, none of that.  He hasn't...  No, not Steve. 
[03:45:30]  Not yet.  Not Steve.  Oh.  And what's his name?  No, it's your name.  Where's your tape?  Uh-oh.  He swaggered and it fell off.  Yeah.  How have the guys been treating you?  Swaggered like that?  Around here?  Yeah.  Not bad so far.  Pretty cool?  Yeah.  To your face?  They've been nice?  To my face.  Yeah, okay.  What do you think of Jared?  Jared?  I like him so far.  Yeah.  Have you two...  What did your duties entail today?  My duties entail today...  I timed your commercials over here. 
[03:46:00]  And then...  And then what did you just write?  Too fucking long?  Yeah.  You know, the listeners...  Wah, wah, wah.  We're like, I'm with me.  We gotta go.  It's a very interesting paper.  We're grueling.  Oh, you guys got the hammer?  Yeah, no, you can do...  You guys want to do a show?  What the fuck?  I'm in the right place.  Fucking fans.  What the fuck?  I like this kid.  He's got on-air charisma.  Hook him up.  I don't like him.  He's got a swagger.  He turns into a radio show.  Yeah?  I'm a mobile DJ, so... 
[03:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  You used to be behind a mic in front of a crowd.  Yeah.  All right.  Getting kids going.  Yeah.  Get the kids going.  Wait, let's hear one of his...  Don't try...  Don't be a hater there, Sam.  Look at Sam.  He's putting his hands on like, oh, oh, oh.  He might be the new fish, but...  Why don't we hear one of his raps?  You were new ones, too.  He raps?  Not really raps.  Not a rapper.  More MC.  I'm more intro myself.  Let's hear some MCing.  What song can you talk over?  Oh, what crap have you had to play?  What, weddings and stuff?  Give us...  Yeah, I'd say it's all weddings, pharmacists. 
[03:47:00]  So you've had to do stuff like the electric slide?  Give us a song that you need to talk over.  All right.  Electric slide?  What song?  How about electric slide?  Yeah, give me the electric slide.  Give me the electric slide.  How the hell do you even look that up?  Under a book.  Danny is looking.  Wasn't that what you were dancing to on Dance Dance Revolution, you fucking asshole?  Remember, Danny, Dance Dance Revolution on YouTube.  Oh, it's gotta be in there.  Come on, it's in there.  Can't spell electric. 
[03:47:30]  Stupid.  That's two L's in that.  Put a K in it.  I don't know the post for that, though.  Oh, you don't?  No.  Yeah, you should be all right.  I think it's got a pretty long intro.  You just gotta do that stupid wedding thing that everybody does to it.  There's one that you know.  Yeah, maybe by Rob Bass.  It takes two by Rob Bass.  All right, how about Rob Bass?  It takes two.  Really?  Oh, wait.  No, the intro's not long enough.  No, the intro's not long enough.  He's got his finger up.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Up his ass, Danny, I mean. 
[03:48:00]  And then Travis points and laughs at him.  You're in the same room, dickhead.  Maybe you could help.  Yeah.  He's just there.  He's just there to laugh.  I know.  Bust a move.  Bust a move?  Oh, that's good.  Like Tone Loke?  That's a cutie and not dance.  Wow.  So am I doing a wedding or am I doing the Opie Anthony show?  Oh, I would think a wedding.  A wedding?  A wedding.  Whatever part of the wedding you want to attribute this song to, you know.  A wedding.  Steve Carlisi is marrying Travis.  Travis, what's your last name? 
[03:48:30]  Oh, we don't need it.  Now it's the new Mr. and Mrs.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, he's the woman.  Of course he's the woman.  Who else would he be?  They fought over.  Yes.  Who's taking whose name?  You know, Steve is going to see this as binding.  It's legally binding.  He'd want to consummate.  He's going to drag Travis home in his hybrid.  Can we do this bit in Massachusetts?  We're cave dudes.  Let's go.  All right.  Ready? 
[03:49:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, leave me again.  Wait, wait, wait.  What happened?  He did that at a wedding hall.  They would tell you to go home.  All right.  He would turn up his own headphones, though.  His headphones weren't turned off.  No, she didn't know.  It's all right.  All right.  Travis.  All right, here we go.  Bust it.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the absolutely beautiful arena here tonight for the Carleese  wedding.  Coming to you first tonight.  A little bit of tone look to get everybody going.  I want everyone on the dance floor right now.  Grandma, mom, dad, Steve, little Travis.  This is a champ for all the fellas. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  It's every wedding I've ever been to.  Tone look.  Yeah, it is.  Wild thing.  I'll bet you find it.  Is it Young MC?  Yeah, that's not tone look.  You're right, Young.  That's not tone look.  Young MC.  Oh, did he redo it?  No.  No, that was just always him.  Yeah, that wasn't even tone look.  That's all right.  Take my DJ card away.  What were you, two when that came out?  All right.  We've been born.  We've got to go.  How are the lines of the day?  They're awesome.  Let's get to it.  Thank you, our new crop of interns. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much, guys.  Why does Jared slouch so much?  He can't help it.  Look at, it's like the antithesis of the, this is Mr. Confidence over here.  He's strutting.  And then we have Mr. fucking Jared slumped over.  I don't talk much.  Look at you.  I'm more of a behind the scenes person.  Yeah.  Do you miss your shell?  Sometimes.  You see that swagger he's got?  Jesus Christ. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  All right.  All right, Jared.  All right, Jared.  Jared, that meant get the fuck out of here when we said thank you.  No, let Jared stay for a minute.  No, get out.  All right.  He's like a monster.  Look at how he walks.  Like, he'd let him bring this.  Oh, God.  He's like Igor or something.  He's kind of like.  No, he's E-bore.  He's like frumpy.  All right, here's.  He should be squeezing through the holes that the cameras play through in a movie theater in a,  Okay, hold on.  Holy shit.  What?  Did I fucking bomb that one?  Wow. 
[03:51:00]  I got.  I was going for a blob joke and completely fell apart.  Why don't you say we wanted to take off his shirt and then freeze him in a bowling alley?  This was a movie theater, I think.  No bowling alley.  Different blobs.  Oh, I'm talking about the original blobs.  We're going to be late.  Is it that important a meeting that we can't be a little late?  Okay, we got to go.  Runner-up line of the day.  Go.  Danny's just all caught up in one video these days, and it's his Dance Dance Revolution video 
[03:51:30]  you can see on YouTube.  What keyword do you have to put in?  Douche.  Dance Dance Danny?  Or Dance Dance Revolution Danny?  Douche.  Douche.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  That stinks, dude.  But then again, here's the thing.  You probably should be dead.  Ship happens, he says.  Ship happens.  You know, because it was a boat.  Okay.  Ship happens.  And finally, here's your line of the day. 
[03:52:00]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What's two rounds of cardio been?  Two rotations of the exercise pilot.  Okay, look at that.  Well, you stood by the rules. 
[03:52:30]  What about E-Rock?  Cock meat.  Cock meat.  Oh.  Nothing but cock meat.  Sorry, I has stepped on cock meat.  Sorry, at least you're going to fall face first into it like Steve has.  Oh, with that, let's get out of here.  We've got to go.  We've got a meeting.  Go, go, go, go.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  Onions.  Why does my crotch smell like onions?  I don't remember eating onions.  Did I sit in onions?  Did I sit in onions?  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
