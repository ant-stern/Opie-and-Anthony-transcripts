<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts and Jim Norton joking about a perpetually broken studio chair, blaming its demise on overweight guests.  The conversation then shifts to Anthony's new aquatic cat, followed by a furious rant about a moldy cake from Food Emporium, punctuated with extensive profanity. The show moves to a review of *Gravity*, highlighting the overwhelmingly positive critical reception alongside some baffling negative reviews.  A substantial portion is dedicated to dissecting the Broncos-Cowboys game, celebrating the Broncos' victory and lambasting Tony Romo's performance, especially his crucial late-game interception. They briefly discuss a new humanoid robot before concluding their initial segment with further debate about Tom Brady's Super Bowl record.

The show continues with more scathing criticism of Tony Romo and football fans, using highly offensive language.  This transitions into a discussion of President Obama's position on the Washington Redskins' name, with the hosts opposing a name change and referencing polls suggesting most Native Americans and the general public weren't concerned.  Speculation follows regarding a potentially offensive Obamacare phone number appearing on the Drudge Report.  The hosts then cover the government shutdown, its impact on Amber Alerts and flu tracking, and an incident where a child bypassed airport security.  A recent self-immolation in Washington D.C., and a news reporter's insensitive tweet linking a local shooting to *Breaking Bad*, are discussed at length, with continued use of offensive language.

A lengthy segment focuses on a violent altercation between a biker gang and an SUV driver, detailing graphic aspects of the incident and the biker's criminal history.  The hosts and callers debate the culpability of both parties, utilizing highly offensive language.  A story about a child shot in a gang-related incident and the subsequent arrest of the father for robbery is also covered.  The hosts share personal anecdotes, including parenting struggles and hangover experiences.  Chuck Tover and a Fox Philly news reporter are mentioned as guests at some point during this portion.  The segment concludes with a discussion of Tommy Two-Tone's song "Jenny."


The show then abruptly shifts to a nonsensical song discussion before moving to a humorous news story about a Yale University student who defecates in laundry dryers ("poopitrator"). This segues into a discussion of outrageous college pranks, with hosts and callers sharing numerous anecdotes, many involving feces.  A significant portion details Opie's daughter's baptism, prompting a wide-ranging conversation about Catholicism, its practices, and the hosts' and callers' varied perspectives on religion, ranging from devout belief to strong skepticism and cynicism, questioning its authority and hypocrisy.  This segment concludes with promotion of Jimmy Norton's comedy shows and a brief discussion of the Affordable Care Act's shortcomings.


A segment heavily critiques unions, highlighting high union salaries (specifically citing $400,000 earners at Carnegie Hall) and their perceived negative impact on industries like the auto industry.  The hosts express frustration with union practices and executive compensation in the auto industry.  Caller Travis discusses increased healthcare costs under Obamacare.  The show then turns to "Prep Burger," a service providing pre-written radio content, which the hosts intensely criticize for its low quality. This leads to a discussion of a "Monday Song Contest," showcasing examples of incredibly bad pre-written Monday songs from Prep Burger.  A phone call with Kate Gosselin ensues, filled with vulgar and sexually suggestive jokes at her expense. The segment concludes with a discussion of Hulk Hogan's web hosting business, "Host-a-mania," and its bizarre promotional video parodying Miley Cyrus.


The show concludes with a post-show discussion hosted by Sam Roberts focusing on the validity of various forms of entertainment and psychic abilities, triggered by the Kate Gosselin segment. Roberts criticizes low-quality radio bits, reality television (specifically the Kardashians), and psychic mediums like the Long Island Medium. Numerous callers share their experiences with psychics, religious faith, out-of-body experiences, and the ethics of exploiting vulnerability. One caller compares staged radio calls to the Eddie Mansfield expos√© in professional wrestling.  A listener mentions Jeffrey Wands, a Glen Cove psychic. The segment promotes the hosts' upcoming shows and social media.  No guests were present during this post-show discussion.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me.  It's me.  I worked here.  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Live?  Now?  This is it?  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here. 
[00:04:00]  This is like different than any other radio.  I'm telling you what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why.  This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement. 
[00:04:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Good morning.  But, but, but, but.  Morning.  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, yes. 
[00:05:00]  Reboot the week.  That's it.  Start again.  Start all over.  You passed go.  We had a little weekend.  And now it's all about fucking Baltic and Mediterranean again.  Nice.  Let's rock.  Fuck.  I like when we're right around nearby boardwalk and part place.  This is fucking, takes forever.  Yeah.  Whole week.  Jesus.  Right now we're on Mediterranean.  Yeah.  Did you just say that? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Baltic Mediterranean.  You know what I used to call those when I was growing up?  Certain kind of properties.  Yeah.  They didn't begin with Baltic B or M.  Of course not.  Oh.  Are you getting it?  Yeah.  Hi, everyone.  Ah, what a great start to the morning we had in here.  What do you mean?  What happened?  Uh, your chair. 
[00:06:00]  I was, I was like beside myself that the people at this fucking place.  We had slobs that worked for this channel.  We were just like.  Big fat fucking slobs.  Big fat fuck that broke up his chair.  We have a brand new fucking chair.  It's the, it's literally the only thing I give a fuck about in this whole studio.  So I could sit and read a few papers at 520 in the morning.  Just want to be comfortable.  The last chair broke because some fat fucking slob broke it.  It's slob. 
[00:06:30]  So we finally had to go out and get a new chair.  Yeah.  And this morning the brand new chair was broken by some fucking slob.  It's like, how the fuck does that happen?  How is it broken?  The whole right side was detached and, you know, so the right side goes flying all the  way back, but the left side doesn't.  Whatever.  There's still plastic around the handle.  That's how new this chair is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It still has a little plastic.  We sort of fixed it.  Hopefully it'll be all right.  We got it. 
[00:07:00]  Are this tags still on it?  Let me see where it's broken though.  Who the fuck uses this studio though?  Yeah.  Open this way?  It's not broken.  They, um, yeah.  Uh, I guess.  Oh, right.  Travis kind of fixed it.  Yeah.  You fixed it, but it was slipped out of the top and, and, and half of it was like leaning  back too far.  Only a fat slob.  Yes.  It had to be that, that the thing pops off the tracking.  Isn't that great?  Whatever.  Who the fuck uses this place on the weekends? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Who does?  Dave.  Eastside Dave.  And who else?  Just Dave?  He's not fat.  Do you have any fat fucks?  How many fat fucks, uh, hang out with him?  Everyone has fat fucks that hang out with them.  Everyone's got some fat fucks.  Sorry, fat fucks.  I know you're listening.  What are you going to do?  They're the only ones listening.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  They know.  They know they're fat.  Way to go.  Way to piss off the fat fucks.  Sorry, fat fucks, you know. 
[00:08:00]  Sorry, fat fucks.  That's a, that's a rousing apology there.  Right.  Kind of sorry, fat fucks.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Ah.  It's kind of nice over the weekend.  Yeah.  Had a little, had a little shindig over my house.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nice.  Jimmy was over.  We had some, um, had some pals come by.  I love the cat.  You do?  The cat is everything I wanted them to be and more. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  You should get one.  Dude, I was seeing that cat and he was so playful and frolicky.  Oh.  Wasn't he playful and frolicky?  It was.  I took the lamest video of the cat.  I can't even post it.  So it's just him walking and I'm trying to call him and then he jumps in the bag and I  turned it off.  I think my video would have gotten eight views.  He was.  Yeah.  Jimmy was loving the cat.  Yeah.  Loves being the cat.  Because I always think kittens are going to scratch and hurt you like some, I like them 
[00:09:00]  but at a distance.  But this one, this little claws.  Oh.  Oh, he was so funny.  Yeah, he doesn't, he doesn't bite or scratch too hard.  No.  He's, uh, I had fun with him over the weekend.  He's lovely.  Yeah.  I put him in the pool.  He was like, because the top steps of my pool, it's about six inches deep.  Not even, maybe five inches deep or something.  Um, and he was just standing on the top there looking around with his little feet in the  water.  Nice.  He likes water.  He's one of those breeds that kind of likes water.  So. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  There he is.  But the.  He's right there.  That breed actually likes water?  Yeah.  Not many, uh, not many cats like the water, right?  No.  Only just a few breeds?  Uh-huh.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  They apparently like going swimming and everything.  Really?  So that cat will be swimming in your pool next year?  That'd be funny.  When it's a lot bigger?  Yeah.  And not as cute?  Leopard sized.  And the girls will be coming out of the pool with cat hair all over their bodies?  Oh, no.  No, he doesn't shed either. 
[00:10:00]  Really?  Yeah, he's really cool.  For real, it doesn't shed or it's not shedding yet?  It doesn't shed.  Wow.  Those breeds don't.  They're not a shedding problem.  They're not really an allergy problem or anything.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that was amazing.  The cat.  Pretty fun.  I thought about the cat all weekend.  You gotta get one, Jimmy.  Look at him.  He's crazy right there.  He's got a crazy face.  Crazy cat.  He's got a little spotted belly.  It's all soft.  Oh, I took a great video.  It's 26 seconds. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  It's just me.  Let's see if you can see it.  Oh, let's see.  He's jumping.  Yeah.  And now he's walking.  Yeah, look at him.  And he's walking around the bag.  Yeah.  And look, he's gonna go in the bag.  Oh, look, he's looking in the bag.  And he jumps in the bag.  Oh, who's cuter than this cat?  Oh, look at him.  And then he's swatting at your camera.  Yeah.  And he's swatting at my camera.  And I try to pet him.  You see my dumb hand walking like child porn.  And he's like, I turn the video on. 
[00:11:00]  Nice.  My child.  That's the worst cat video I've ever seen.  Isn't he terrible?  But he's so...  I got a good fucking picture of him licking me.  He's very licky.  Yeah, he likes giving you little kisses.  On your nose.  On your nose.  He goes with his little sandpaper tongue.  Oh, he's great.  Oh, my God.  Is he great?  He's so much fun.  I forgot how much I love animals.  Yeah.  I'm very good with them.  He's just fun.  They love me, too, though.  It's mutual. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Although the cat could get enough of me.  But then, you know, Anthony might have retired at one point.  Oh, Christ.  He said, time for bed.  Time for bed.  We were like, where's Anthony?  He's upstairs.  I see.  It was a...  What time is that at?  11-something.  It was a long day.  On the weekend?  Yeah.  I was up pretty early, and then I think at the crack of noon, I started putting a few  back, because it was nice out, you know. 
[00:12:00]  It was beautiful.  And then by, yeah, by 11...  It was bedtime.  Pretty much down for the count.  The worst part of that was the cat was gone.  That's how I noticed.  That's how I noticed you weren't there.  I was like, where's the fucking cat?  Yeah, I'm a little cat.  He's up with Anthony.  I'm like, oh, Ant's upstairs.  Yeah.  Does he sleep when you sleep?  Yeah.  He went up with you, right?  Yeah, he comes up.  He curls up on the bed, and he goes to sleep.  Nice.  Little purrs.  Oh, he's great. 
[00:12:30]  He's my little buddy.  He's my little pal.  You gotta get another one now.  No!  Two would be cute.  I don't need that shit.  You wouldn't want another one just like...  That's adorable.  Nah.  A couple of froth that he's playing.  And then they just fuck around with each other, and they don't give you the time of day.  Fuck that.  You need attention.  I need some attention.  Wait till he gets older.  It's a two-way street, you little fucker.  Wait till he gets older.  Then get another younger one.  Right.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Show him who's boss.  Show him who's boss.  Go look, you stupid fucking cat. 
[00:13:00]  You got too big.  You should have stayed small.  That's terrible.  And kitten-like.  He's such a...  This is what I do now.  I bring a new fucking kitten into the house.  And he meows if you hold him too long, because he wants to play.  Yeah.  He gets irritated.  If you hold him too long, he's like...  And you're like, all right.  And you put him down.  All right.  Because he's got this giant fucking house to explore.  And he's like, he'll play with you, but he doesn't want to be forced to be held.  Yeah.  When I leave the house, he just starts screaming.  He meows?  At the door.  Yeah.  Really loud. 
[00:13:30]  And then, you know.  You should release a few mice in your house as it goes.  Oh, yeah.  Just so he has something to look for when he's just wandering around.  Oh, he'll get them.  Oh, he'll get them.  He'll stalk them.  He'll pounce on that shit.  I don't...  I think regular little toys are good enough.  That's good enough.  Good enough for him.  Yeah.  So he meows at the door?  Yeah.  He meows at the door.  He gets all sad that he's old, you know.  Well, he's probably saying, and stay out.  Yeah.  I know.  It's like, oh, he's lonely.  He's like, no, good.  He's like, he's calling other cats.  Come on.  He's gone. 
[00:14:00]  Get over here.  Yeah.  That's good.  Very good.  Yeah.  So, uh...  I want one now, man.  I just can't.  My place is an okay size for a cat, but he'll be fucking touching everything.  Just get...  Touching everything.  Just get a kitten, Jimmy.  Come on.  Yeah, he'll be scratching my fucking sofa.  All your memorabilia's all fucking scratched.  Oh, if I see a little scratch mark in my Sabbath poster.  Oh, God.  He'll just mark his territory on your Black Sabbath shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  That would be great. 
[00:14:30]  He just sprays.  I clip his nails.  How do you know you're not clipping too far?  Eh, I used to do it with, like, four fucking cats when I had four cats.  But it's like, yeah.  Screaming, you know you got it good.  Yeah.  You just don't...  You can see, like, their nails.  They got a little red in there.  Yeah, you can see the shit.  You just take the tips off.  How do you...  How do you hold him still for that?  I put him on his back.  Like, right there between my knees, kind of.  And then he gets...  Don't rust on your balls.  You squeeze the little hand, and his little claws come out, like a magic trick. 
[00:15:00]  And then you just...  Does he yell or no?  No.  He's good.  Might squirm a little, but then you kind of...  Put him down there.  You choke him out.  Choke him out.  Knock him out.  Yeah, because his nails...  He gets crazy where he loves, like, climbing up your pant leg.  So, you know, you got to keep those nails clipped so he can't do it.  So he doesn't poke your skin.  It's not so bad when you're wearing, like, heavy pants, jeans, or something like that.  But you come down in those loose linen fucking walk-around-the-house pants. 
[00:15:30]  Holy fuck.  That first time he jumps up and grabs a hole of your goddamn thigh meat.  Ow!  You motherfucker!  You should bring him in one day.  Cat day.  I should.  You should try to have kitten day.  Walk on the fucking console.  You have to make sure that the hole's all fucking...  Oh, he'll just explore everything.  Yeah, but he'll get fucked up in the wires.  He'll just chew the wires.  Sharon in Florida says there's mini cats that don't get very big.  Those mini fucking dogs, they're not... 
[00:16:00]  Not real dogs.  You know when they're not puppies anymore.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  Puppies and kittens are adorable.  Yeah.  But if they stay that size, then for some reason they're not as adorable.  You just know, I think.  Yeah, nothing...  They just start smelling differently or something.  Nothing worse than the old small dog.  Yeah, no.  It looks like, like, oh, is that a pup?  Oh, no, it's not.  It's got, like, fucking tumors on its hips and fucking...  Yeah, it just smells like a wet blanket.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, fuck.  I want to trash Food Emporium.  Oh, I saw that.  It's the best song ever.  I saw that.  Someone made a store just for me.  Food Emporium.  Someone with a...  My kind of...  Equality.  Food Emporium.  Food Emporium.  Fuck.  Someone's da-da-da-da.  Fuck Food Emporium.  Food Emporium.  You don't like... 
[00:17:00]  Fuck Food Emporium.  Food Emporium.  What'd they do?  They don't give a shit.  Yeah, they don't.  No.  Well, it was my daughter's first birthday, and we decided on Friday, which was her actual  birthday, to get a little cake.  Yeah.  A little strawberry shortcake.  A little cake, like, this big, so she can mush it and do whatever the fuck she wanted  with it.  It's kind of tradition around my parts.  We brought it home.  To smash a cake?  Yes, basically. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  Let the kids smash them, too.  Why should I have all the fun?  And, uh...  Oh, my...  Just when we were...  We sang happy birthday, we FaceTimed with relatives, got it all done, cut the cake, turn it sideways  to put it on a plate for others, and it was fucking mold all over the goddamn bottom  of the fucking cake.  Oh, yuck.  So thank you, Food Emporium.  Oh, yuck.  Thank you.  Did anyone eat it before you noticed? 
[00:18:00]  Thank you.  I guess my daughter will have a cake the next time she turns one.  Thank you.  Ew.  Thank you.  Are those black spots the mold?  Yeah, that's not chips.  What's that?  Oh, fuck.  How did you know that was mold?  I would have thought that was part of the cake.  Did someone notice that?  In the picture, no, if you saw it in person, you would go, holy fuck, that's a moldy cake.  It's got that little hairy mold kind of stuff on it.  In the picture, you might go, what, is that chocolate somethings?  Is that whatever? 
[00:18:30]  Right.  I mean, there's no chocolate in the cake.  Right.  It's a strawberry shortcake.  Usually they don't add chocolate to that.  The whole bottom, as you can see, is spotted with mold, and then there was mold in the inside  as well.  So fuck you, Food Emporium.  Did you guys go to a...  And I love that people are tweeting them.  I didn't tell you to fucking tweet them.  Didn't you go to cake shopping first, somewhere else?  Yeah, that was for some other shit.  The other fucking thing that went down, so...  This was just for our little fucking family on her day. 
[00:19:00]  It was four of us trying to enjoy that tiny little fucking cake.  Moldy cake.  Look how moldy it is.  Did anyone eat it before you noticed or no?  Yeah.  Yeah, she did.  The little one.  Oh, no.  Started eating the top of it and stuff.  She's fine, whatever, fuck.  So I call them up.  They don't give a fuck.  They're like, bring the cake back in your receipt.  I'm like, I'm not bringing the cake back.  Treat yourself.  Get out.  To prove it.  To, what, get 16 fucking dollars back?  Go fuck yourself.  How about a sorry? 
[00:19:30]  No sorries.  They didn't give a fuck.  Whatsoever.  Then the assholes on Twitter.  What were they supposed to do?  What were they supposed to do?  Twitter.  I just told you what they were supposed to do.  They could have said sorry.  They didn't give a fuck.  No.  And what, you're supposed to bring a moldy cake back to the store to prove it?  What?  What?  People are that desperate that they're going to fucking bring, you know, lie about a moldy cake? 
[00:20:00]  Like, right?  Fuck.  And plus, it was far away.  It was like 20 blocks from us.  Fuck that shit.  So thanks, Food Emporium.  I really appreciate it.  It was wonderful.  Supposedly they're supposed to have good stuff.  I don't believe that whatsoever.  Hey, look.  It's the boat movie.  That's Friday, right?  Yeah.  Finally.  I'm going Tuesday to see it. 
[00:20:30]  Tomorrow.  You're going to go see the boat movie?  I'm going to go see the boat movie.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  That's all I've been saying all fucking weekend.  It's supposed to be my thing.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  That sounds like a retard.  Primetime fucking.  Would you be pissed at a cake like that?  Would you be pissed off at a cake like that?  Yeah.  Maybe they made it in a fucking cake mold. 
[00:21:00]  You take lemons and make lemonade every time.  Piece of garbage.  That's disgusting.  Did it smell moldy?  No, not really.  No?  But it was throughout the whole fucking thing.  Oh, God.  They got to know those cakes don't last that long, right?  Yeah.  So why the fuck are they selling them?  Probably got a wet in the bottom or something.  What is it?  The food import in that desperate or something?  They got to keep the cakes laying around a little longer?  Was there a date on it? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It was like, I don't know, sell by August 1st or something.  No.  I have no idea what the date was, the expiration date, so.  But that was like a bummer, like.  Of course.  Have a little family thing, the candle.  And now it's like, well, now we can't eat the cake.  What'd you do?  Did you run out and get on?  No, it was late.  How did you notice from the bottom?  No, see the piece that's cut out.  You know how you cut cake and then you lay it on the side. 
[00:22:00]  Good presentation.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You cut a piece of cake and lay it on the side.  You lay it on the side.  That's how you properly do it.  Oh, oh, that cake.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, and there was a little mold on that.  I got you.  The slice of cake, not the rest of the cake.  No, then I.  See, I thought maybe you just cut a slice out and then you take the rest of the round  cake and put it on the side for presentation.  I'm like, that's crazy.  No, it was mostly in the bottom half of the cake, but I, yeah, you cut the slice.  Right, right.  And then you present it on the plate and then my wife goes, don't eat it. 
[00:22:30]  And then I rolled the rest of the cake over to investigate.  Oh, it's like turning over a piece of slate in the yard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to love that.  I don't know what you're going to see under that.  You used to get salamanders and worms.  Worms.  You used to get leeches and fucking snails.  Sometimes you get old flogs.  That was like an adventure.  Slugs.  As a kid, you're like, oh, look, there's a piece of fucking slate or a big rock or something.  You're like, what's under there?  Oh, it's just a fucking wonderland of disgusting nature. 
[00:23:00]  That's why I love doing this fucking radio show.  You bring up memories that you forget all about.  We would spend hours in the woods just turning shit over.  It's like, oh, I got a good one.  And that's like some asshole just like turning your whole house over.  You're fucking sitting watching TV.  Your house just rolls off of you.  That's what it really is.  It sucks.  That's a hurricane to them.  Right.  They're like, what the fuck?  I'm minding my own business.  I'm not bothering you.  Do I see your big house down, you know, down at the bottom of the hill here? 
[00:23:30]  Leave me the fuck alone.  They all start moving a lot faster.  Right.  And a lot more.  You could tell they're very distressed once you flip that thing over.  Oh, God, man.  The worms start like fucking tying themselves in knots.  You think their blood pressure goes up?  Oh, yeah.  They don't like it.  I forgot about that.  And every once in a while, the big get was a nice snake.  A snake.  Yeah.  You'd see like a fucking garter snake or something.  I used to say gardener.  Yeah.  Garden snake.  Well, there's garden snakes and then there's garter snakes. 
[00:24:00]  Garter.  I don't know.  Which is, I guess they're tiny like a little woman's garter.  Right.  You know.  Wow.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  Fun.  So, I'm glad we have a radio show where we can beat the shit out of Food Emporium because  this happens to somebody that doesn't have a radio show.  They're just fucked.  He's got a fucking moldy cake in his garbage and a fucking frustrated attitude because he can't  take it out on anybody.  They're also told to just bring the moldy cake back and, yeah, that's good.  In the middle of a birthday celebration.  I'll get right on that. 
[00:24:30]  Let me leave right now to return the moldy cake to get our $16 back.  Give you another moldy cake.  Right.  Did you hear about that store that's opening next year?  Oh.  The founder of Trader Joe's is opening up an expired food store.  No.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  Ew.  It's kind of smart, actually.  Yeah.  Because most, like, sell-by date food-  Is bullshit.  It's still good.  That's what I try to tell people in my house all the time.  I'm like, okay, the milk says 10-4 and it's 10-5. 
[00:25:00]  We're okay.  Don't worry about it.  By a day.  A few days, even.  Gone.  A lot of it is sell-by, not eat-by.  Garbage.  You know?  Really?  Don't throw it away.  Yep.  Really?  If there's two containers of milk, one open, one unopened, the open one is expired, like,  that day, the sell-  I will grab the new one, open it up, and fucking use that.  What's wrong with you guys?  I do not fucking even fuck with that expiration shit.  First of all, it's just going to taste better.  Yeah.  Not really.  It's just going to taste better.  I mean, Lucky Charm, sure, but not milk. 
[00:25:30]  Milk is such a fucking-  Milk is milk.  I don't like milk.  I'm not a fan of it at all.  But I do occasionally like some cereal, which, you know, you got to put some on there.  And if it's not, like, fresh fucking milk, cold and fresh, if it's got that weird kind  of-  I think-  Skunky taste to it, where it's not turned, but it's just starting.  It ain't good.  Smells a little gamey.  On cereal, it's fine, but when you're getting a big glass of milk, it just means you miss  mommy's boobies.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  You're just fucking grabbing the big round mug with two hands and squeezing it. 
[00:26:00]  It's just creepy if you think about it.  It's creepy.  Who drinks a glass of milk?  I don't know.  I could never do that.  I will sometimes only with, like, a peanut butter sandwich.  Ugh, God, you phlegmy mess.  And that's like-  Yuck.  With peanut butter?  Yeah.  You could hawk a good luge after that.  And that's really, like-  You don't do jelly?  Just peanut butter?  No.  You don't do jelly?  A peanut butter sandwich with milk?  A tall glass of milk?  We're talking, like, once a year, I'll get that weird, like, oh, I kind of want that.  What do you do?  What else do you do?  Look at a Grover puppet show?  It sounds terrible. 
[00:26:30]  Shit snack that is.  It's fucking awful.  What do you do?  Well, I get some marmalade, and I dip fucking human toenails into it.  You have a box of strawberries a day.  Just once a year?  Exactly.  Thank you.  Make my point completely.  So, yeah, he's going to repackage all the food and sell it at deep, discounted prices.  But how long can he have it on his shelf?  A lot of turnover time there.  Now there's expired, expired.  Right?  Yeah, what's the real expiration date?  Garbage.  I think that's really smart.  It'll be really cheap. 
[00:27:00]  Because it'll pretty much get most of that food almost dirt cheap, and then he can sell it to the poor people.  The poor people.  That's what bug me about it.  They tend to live in clusters.  Hey, man, I was one of those poor people.  Poor people got to go in and buy expired food.  My mom would have absolutely been a huge customer of this supermarket.  The world needs ditch stickers, too, you know.  Something shitty about that.  Like, is this going to happen to go in and buy expired food?  Like, oh, man.  No, but I'm with Travis. 
[00:27:30]  A lot of this shit.  I've eaten all sorts of stuff that, you know, was past expiration date, and I knew it was completely fine.  Sure, if you can get a box of cookies for half the price.  No, no, I understand.  A box of cookies is one thing because they're a day or two past.  But I'm talking about milk and cheese.  Maybe you won't sell milk and cheese and things like that, or you can get sick from it.  Even cheese.  I mean, most stuff, I'm telling you, it's the fruits and vegetables that go bad fast.  Yeah, it's not like the expired day comes and, like, mold immediately appears.  They have to have a big-time safe zone.  Yeah.  Right.  So they're so conservative with their expiration dates. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Like, the expiration date is already very conservative just so that you don't have any chance of eating the mold.  Supposedly, medications aren't supposed to ever expire.  That's just a drug thing just to get you to, you know, be a customer coming back for more.  Oh.  Supposedly.  I read that recently.  Like, the expiration dates on pills is completely bullshit.  Yeah, because you wonder what happens to a pill that it fucking gets.  Because I've thrown pills out that have expired.  It's losing its potency.  I've never had Cialis expire. 
[00:28:30]  I have to get used quickly.  You've got to ask Dr. C, but supposedly that's all bullshit, too.  Because they want you to buy more.  Yeah, I'd like to ask him about expiration date.  What's the buffer?  And how can he sell it if there's an expiration date on it?  How is he allowed to do that?  And does he open himself up for lawsuits?  What's he going to call?  I'm sure he's not awake.  So these stores are going to pop up?  God, that's going to be a little.  He's doing, he's starting, one is going to be in Boston.  And then see how it goes.  Very interesting.  So he figured out that these.  It's not a bad idea.  All this food goes somewhere. 
[00:29:00]  So he went in and made a deal and said, look, I know what you're going to do.  You're going to pretty much throw this away or whatever.  I'll take all this shit.  Right?  Yeah.  What's it called, this store?  It's called.  Almost Moldy.  The Daily Table.  The Moldy Cake.  The Daily Table.  Oh, wait a minute.  The Daily Table.  What's it mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I wonder how long he keeps the food for.  What's up with you today?  I don't know.  I just called The Daily Table. 
[00:29:30]  Sam had nothing there.  That was great.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've seen a boat movie.  I've seen a boat movie.  I don't know.  I've got a table.  There's something of a table.  Oh, dearly.  We got a few retweets from the Scott and Todd people.  Oh.  What?  Yeah, because somebody said that, you know, thanks for getting that stupid taco meat song  in my head.  Oh.  And then they retweeted like it was a nice, like that was a good tweet or something.  Oh, like it was a compliment?  Yeah.  People loved that fucking, that Friday, Scott and Todd, Chucktober. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  It was fun-filled.  It is a home run.  You can't lose with them.  Plus, how do you get, I mean, the odds in the first week of Jacktober of finding a new  tree on my house.  A new fucking catchphrase, right?  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  The boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  The boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie. 
[00:30:30]  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  Why don't you see the boat movie?  Why don't you see the boat movie?  I was getting boat movie tweets all weekend.  Of course, we all did.  And then the people were making movie posters.  The boat movie.  Hey, God damn.  That damn gravity did fucking well, huh?  People are loving it.  Yeah.  55, something like that, 56 million?  It's got like 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.  It's ridiculously good.  Gravity?  Yeah, it's just so goddamn good. 
[00:31:00]  The only person I've seen badmouthed is Breddy Stinellis on Twitter,  who I like as a writer.  He wrote American Psycho.  He hated it.  Why did he hate it?  No idea.  Could you go to Rotten Tomatoes?  I want to read the reviews of idiots that hated that movie.  But there is a review of somebody that he retweeted  who didn't like it from The New Yorker, which I didn't read.  And I'm like, I guess.  The New Yorker?  The guy has the right to his opinion.  But how could you not like anything about that movie?  That's a ziggy.  98.  Give me a...  It's nice to see a non-sequel movie getting this positive reception. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, there's a negative, Nellie.  Read that one, Sam.  Bullock and Clooney are good at playing themselves,  but it felt like they phoned it in,  making the film feel shallow.  Some nice visuals,  but nothing that we haven't seen in far better space films.  Really?  What?  The fucking idiot.  Really?  That was from Eclipse Magazine.  All I hear is about how amazing this technology is.  That's a really...  That's a Star Wars fan who's disappointed  that there's no Death Monster. 
[00:32:00]  What an idiot.  No Death Monster.  Where's the Zippy Planet?  How do you...  I thought she was amazing in that.  They were spinning all over the fucking place.  Yeah.  Sandra Bullock seemed really upset about being stuck.  She was fucking great.  I believed that she was really bummed out.  I believed...  I phoned it in.  No.  I had a tough time believing Clooney was an astronaut  because he's so fucking famous,  but I even got past that shit.  That was my only tiny little gripe because...  I also don't know how you pull off being devilishly charming 
[00:32:30]  even in outer space.  Yeah.  Well, during a space disaster.  It's like...  Yeah, it's still charming.  Like the ocean's kept.  Yeah.  Yeah, he might as well have had a bow tie on his space suit.  You can see...  You can see why he gets the pussy.  Oh, yeah.  He's all man, right?  Oh, boy.  Medication doesn't expire.  Liquid form of medications will expire.  Pills, I guess he was supposed to write here.  Pills do not.  He was flirting and they had no way to come back to Earth.  Slant Magazine. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, boy.  Slant Magazine.  All right.  Let's fly.  Slant Magazine.  That's terrible.  Oh, the gut-wrenching, immersive elements are almost above reproach,  but ultimately, it's all effect and little affect.  Ah.  Bravo.  You know how to use those words.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, what is it?  You know exactly what...  What an idiot.  Somebody did well on the verbal section. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Congratulations on your wonderful SAT score, you cunt.  What else we got?  Eric Weber of NECN writes,  as Cuaron...  That's how you say his name, the director?  As Cuaron spells out in his intro,  life in space is impossible.  So is forming any emotional attachment to gravity.  Wow.  They just want to be different.  They just want to be clever and different.  Yeah, it's all it is.  The effects were... 
[00:34:00]  You don't have to...  If you didn't like it, fine,  but the fucking effects were amazing.  They can't like a movie that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are in.  George Clooney, you think it makes them fucking hip to dislike it?  Right, right.  They're like, oh, I like more of the arthouse city.  I can't imagine anyone not liking that movie.  Yeah, like, there was a movie a couple years ago  that, like, got universally positive reviews.  Right.  And there was that one guy who decided to just write a negative review.  I forget what movie it was.  Well, you all...  Anyone that's on Twitter or Facebook understands this culture.  I haven't heard a bad thing about that.  People just have to be assholes. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Or they have to just be negative,  even though they probably don't even, you know,  believe what they're writing.  Negative nails.  I mean, you don't have to be blown away by the movie,  but I can't really see anyone hating the movie.  That's ridiculous.  You should go to...  I don't want to give away anything,  but I didn't read the bad review  that Brady St. Ellis Twittered.  He tweeted, I guess, their link to the review,  or the guy's name.  Maybe you could look at him.  But I was surprised and like, wow, man.  Mm-hmm.  I guess, you know...  What other negative reviews? 
[00:35:00]  We're done with those?  No.  From something called Looking Closer.  Right.  This dude writes,  a worst space scenario...  That's all?  ...in which everything that can go wrong does.  It's basically Sandra Bullock  in the terrible, horrible, no good,  very bad spacewalk.  Very bad?  Well, that's a play on the Alexander  in the terrible, horrible, no good,  very bad day.  But Sandra was spacewalking.  And the last one 
[00:35:30]  is the AV Club  who wrote,  Watching Gravity often feels  like watching an especially long prep reel  for Star Tours  without ever being allowed  to board the ride.  Oh, they thought  there's not enough action or two...  What?  I don't know.  That's not even a bad review, though.  He gave it a B-.  They just took out  the one little bad sentence  and the whole review.  A B-, I would say,  is a good review.  Mm-hmm.  It's fairly action-packed.  You saw it too, Sam? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, I saw it in IMAX 3D.  It was crazy.  It was wild, wasn't it?  Were you able to get tickets  this weekend?  Mm-hmm.  Where, here?  No, I mean, in Westchester.  It was full, but I bought them.  No, Alamo doesn't have an IMAX.  I just saw a regular 3D  and now I gotta see IMAX 3D.  I'm going back.  I rarely go back  to see a movie  in a theater twice.  I hear that's the only way  to see this movie.  It is.  I usually don't like 3D or IMAX.  You see that opening shot,  how amazing that was?  Amazing.  And how tiny that little dot  of a space shuttle was at first?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  And how the director  just took his fucking time? 
[00:36:30]  Talking about the boat movie?  No.  I wanna see the boat movie.  It's not out yet, though.  He wants to see the boat.  I wanna see the boat movie.  That opening shot was amazing.  Yeah.  Absolutely amazing.  Mm-mm-mm.  And then it just was action-packed.  Ugh, the whole time.  And then, yeah,  just the use of space in space  was so impressive.  What did the frog represent?  It's been driving me nuts.  I don't know.  I guess the simplicity of life? 
[00:37:00]  Maybe saying that we're not as smart  as we think we are?  This way up?  Maybe.  I think that's all it was.  There was a little bit of, like...  There were, like, three actors  and a frog in this movie.  That's it, huh?  No one else found that weird?  It's probably one of the frogs  from Magnolia.  One, two, three, what?  Four?  How many actors in the movie  that you saw?  Three?  Maybe four.  Yeah, well, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe a fourth, you know.  A little mission control action?  Yeah, you have to have that, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Aw.  That surprise.  There was a little bit of...  Kitties.  Those are tigers.  It hasn't seen this yet.  You haven't seen the movie yet?  No, no, I haven't seen that yet.  There was a little bit of  every conceivable thing possible  going wrong, going wrong.  Yeah.  Like, at one point,  I was like, okay.  All right, how much more shit  can go wrong with these people? 
[00:38:00]  But I almost wanted  just a little more downtime.  Yeah, like, there were...  Some of that  probably wouldn't have happened.  I'm just...  What's wrong?  I'm reading this review.  And again...  What review?  The one...  From that one guy?  Richard Brode.  And again, you can't...  The guy's got the right  to not like the movie.  And he's giving reasons  he doesn't like it.  Hmm.  And so in someone's opinion,  it's kind of hard  to get annoyed at it.  But you're reading it  and you're like,  ugh, what a douche. 
[00:38:30]  He's just douchey?  Yeah, but...  Hmm.  Again, it's always...  It's hard with someone's opinion  to say he shouldn't...  You know, if he didn't like it,  he didn't like it.  Maybe he's being genuine  because he wrote a lot about it.  Hmm.  But just...  When sometimes people  are just trying too hard...  Yeah.  He calls it  viscerally thrilling  and deadly boring.  How...  Deadly...  It was just being an asshole.  It's almost like  they didn't give it  a bunch of Hollywood garbage 
[00:39:00]  story-wise.  Right.  Like, they're worth...  It was a fairly believable  to the much as you can  and yet that's the criticism  of it, like...  And they didn't fall in love  with themselves  by making it too long.  You know what I mean?  Like, they didn't...  Right.  It's like 90 minutes.  Mm-hmm.  It's the shortest...  I've seen that.  Like, big movie  in a long time.  It felt good.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You didn't feel like  you were sitting there too long.  You didn't feel like  you wanted to be there longer  if that makes sense.  Right.  It just felt good.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, fuck.  Let's go eat now. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That was awesome.  That should be on the poster.  It just felt good.  I don't know.  It's hard to explain, I guess.  Because some movies,  you know, it's so good  you're like, oh, fuck it.  Just, I want more.  I want more.  They didn't leave you  needing to want more.  I don't know.  And the trailer didn't spoil it.  The trailer...  We all kind of goofed  on the trailer, I think.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  Well, because of the Clooney  and Sandra Bullock factor.  We thought there's no way.  I mean, I think what we said  was the trailer looked cool.  Yeah.  But we started thinking, 
[00:40:00]  what could they possibly do  with this concept?  The girl from the bus.  Right.  Yeah, because it just seemed  like open water and space  from the trailer.  Right.  I'm like, all right,  cool trailer, but now what?  And, well, they pulled it off.  I think a lot of people  saw it this weekend, too.  A ton of people.  Did well.  You don't like his review, Jimmy?  No, it just irritated me, but...  Jesus.  Yeah, he's got the real...  He doesn't like it.  He doesn't like it.  The fuck is that thing?  A fake dog robot? 
[00:40:30]  It's like a robot,  but it's running like a...  Oh, that's old.  ...fucking horse or something.  We've done that.  We've done a discussion on that.  That's old.  Wow, yeah.  It's like a pack donkey  following a guy up a hill.  Made by the same company.  Six feet, 330 pounds.  It's a humanoid robot  that can use tools.  It can walk, as you can see,  up mountainous terrain.  Therese basically says,  basically, folks,  this is the Terminator.  You should be afraid of it.  They are actually designed, though,  to assist the military,  carrying equipment,  do all sorts of other tasks. 
[00:41:00]  I have to say,  it's really, really remarkable.  I think the reason  why it freaks it out so much,  freaks our producer out,  is because it doesn't have a head.  But it's fascinating.  The problem?  Oh, with the robber's...  ...care you?  Okay.  Well, that big bitch did.  It doesn't bother you at all.  No.  I think it's fascinating.  This is what they look like.  The only thing that scares me  is that knees seem...  What kind of bitch she is?  That's my knee when I watch her run.  When you see her run,  that video's really amazing  when you see her run  because it's almost replicating  a dog or a horse.  Or a pig.  What do you know about running?  Like, it's really...  And it even trips at one point 
[00:41:30]  and gets right back up.  But think about...  Look how fast that thing's running.  I know you can't see this.  Some motherfucker chasing you.  All the variables of using...  This video will be everywhere today.  That's the fucking...  I think Rogan was the one  that turned me on to that  originally.  That's pretty cool.  That might be a different version  of what we saw a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like one of the jokes, yeah.  I don't have to outrun the robot.  I just have to outrun...  The two of us.  One of you two.  Now, I've come back.  I've seen Chris Cuomo.  He's about 6'3".  And he's tiny compared  to that big bitch. 
[00:42:00]  He's definitely outrunning her.  You're more of a man and a robot.  Move her back in the set.  It's really powerful.  Why is she the one  who's on the side of the desk?  She's the one  who should be behind the desk.  Everyone knows  forced perspective.  You're just making it way worse.  Put her in the back.  How big do you think she is?  Six feet?  She's got to be  at least six feet  and pushing 300 pounds.  Wow.  I think she's pushing 300 pounds.  She is. 
[00:42:30]  Because Chris Cuomo  used to work out in our gym.  He's a big fucker.  He's huge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks tiny next door.  I know.  That's what I'm trying  to tell you here today.  All right.  So, gravity did well  over the weekend.  And my Broncos  did fucking great.  I know you're Broncos.  You're Broncos.  You bleed Bronco Orange?  Yes, I do.  Wow.  I heard they beat Dallas.  I didn't see any of it.  Oh.  It was a sick game.  It was a shootout.  But I had no doubt that...  And Dallas hung in there  right to the end.  Then what happened?  I didn't see again.  I'll be honest.  They fucked up. 
[00:43:00]  Dallas was up 14-0.  That's what happens  with a winner.  Peyton's a winner.  The fucking...  Romo's not.  And that's...  Literally, I don't care  how well it went out.  That's why he won  and Romo didn't.  I think they were down  like 37-20  and they came back.  Who?  And then Romo fucked up  near the end.  Oh, Dallas, where are you?  Yeah.  Romo had another fuck up.  Yeah, I mean, Romo...  And then the Broncos  kicked the field goal  to win 51-48.  What was Romo's final fuck up?  51-48.  What was his fuck up, Romo?  I didn't see it.  Does anyone know what it was?  No.  I'm not surprised if he choked  because that's what he does. 
[00:43:30]  He's never going to win  a big game  and he never has.  You kind of had  a little fuck up there.  What was the...  It was like the fifth  highest point total,  I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Dude, he'll play great  in the regular season.  He's just not a big game guy.  It was a great game.  At all.  The NFL, I mean,  I finally got the red zone  because we all talked  about it for years.  It's the best.  It's the only way  to watch football,  but there's so many people  that don't have the red zone  for whatever reason.  They're idiots.  And the NFL,  you know,  fantasy football,  I don't personally like it, 
[00:44:00]  but I know,  like everyone else,  a million people that do it.  And it's just not fair.  Like, in New York,  there was only one game  on basically yesterday.  That's how it is everywhere.  No, I understand.  And it was the fucking Giants  who just are horrible this year.  They're 0-5.  So you get to sit down  for some Sunday football  if you don't have the red zone  or other means.  You're stuck watching  this shitty game.  Yeah, or if you're not  paying $300 for DirecTV's  football package or whatever.  And then the 4 o'clock game  was the Broncos-Cowboys,  which was awesome.  But that was it. 
[00:44:30]  They only offered two games  in New York yesterday.  Gotta watch red zone.  You know?  It's the best.  Red zone rules, but...  They don't take commercials  on red zone.  They don't.  No.  And they're not allowed  to start until 1 o'clock.  What is that about?  Well, the games don't start  until 1.  Yeah, but you would think  they would start  a little early  just to kind of warm up.  They have a countdown clock.  Yeah, right?  There's some highlights on it.  There's no highlights yet.  Did he throw an interception?  Fucking cocksucker.  Did that cocksucker  throw an interception?  But he scored 48 
[00:45:00]  for the Cowboys  or was part of 48 points,  whatever.  But still,  to throw an interception,  that's the difference  between a great quarterback  and a guy who will  never, ever fucking win.  Oh, he fucking stinks.  He was in there  right to the end.  Exactly, but he blew it.  He's almost like the guy  who drives well all day  but then runs over a kid  in his own driveway.  That's it.  He threw an interception  on the 24.  When, though?  Oh, late.  With 239 left. 
[00:45:30]  There you go.  That's why Romo  is a fucking hunk of shit.  We had the same quarterback  for a while.  Sanchez was like that.  Good skills,  but could just never  get it done  when you really, really need him.  Wait, I thought you were  a Broncos fan.  Well, I am a Broncos fan, but...  Were the Cowboys up  when he did that?  No, it was tied.  It was tied.  It was tied,  and he fucking...  48-48.  What a fucking...  Wait, on his own 24  or the Broncos 24?  On his own 24.  What a twat.  What a twat.  Then they got to kick  a field goal  and that was it.  God, is he worthless.  Peyton Manning is having  a ridiculous year. 
[00:46:00]  It's amazing.  I have to do a make good  because when Elway  got rid of stupid Tebow,  I beat the shit  out of Elway.  Yeah, he's incredible  this year.  They bring in Peyton.  He's unbelievable,  and Tebow is nowhere.  Wow.  He threw his first  interception this year,  yesterday.  Yeah, that was it.  Yeah.  First one.  I don't think I watched...  I don't think I watched  like a second of football.  That's cool.  You were doing  other manly stuff  like playing with your cat.  Yeah, playing with my cat. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I watched football.  You even admitted  you liked the red zone.  Yeah, red zone's cool  if it's a game  I would kind of,  you know, care about watching.  Yeah, then I would fucking...  What do you mean?  It's all games, though.  Yeah, no, I mean, like if...  Like the matchups?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just not into it,  especially this year.  I'm just not fucking...  I'm into it.  Well, you gotta, you know,  jump on the fucking  Broncos bandwagon like I am.  Should I do that?  I love the Broncos now.  I think it's kicking...  It would be a great story  if he turns around  and wins a Super Bowl for Denver. 
[00:47:00]  That would be fucked up.  Super Bowl's in my fucking jersey  this year, too.  I think they're the best team  in football.  Jersey Super Bowl, right?  It is, yes.  We're not going.  We're not going to the Super Bowl?  No.  It's right across the river.  Why aren't we?  If we can't do this...  It's gonna be cold.  Oh, God, that old gag.  We gotta start that old gag  up already?  The Super Bowl march?  Oh, God.  March right over the bridge  and go.  This will be the 20th year  without us going.  I think this is the big 20.  I'm sure you could tailgate  if you want.  Nobody's gonna stop you.  That would be nice. 
[00:47:30]  That would be great.  What about Radio Row?  Radio Row would be good.  Brady's streak ended yesterday.  That was big news.  What was his streak?  He had 52 games  with a touchdown pass.  Yeah.  And then he threw  an interception  to end the game.  Whoops.  But Brady has, what,  three Super Bowls  or four?  He's got three or four.  He's like one of the  greats ever.  He doesn't have four.  Sure, yeah.  So if he has a shit season,  he's entitled to it.  How many fucking  Super Bowls Brady have?  Well, he's also got  no receivers, so.  Yeah.  Romo is a fucking 
[00:48:00]  sickening choke.  That's like me doing  great setups on stage  every night  and bombing on  every punchline.  That's like me giving you  a wonderful setup  and then when I'm supposed  to go, they own it.  Oh, here it comes.  I go, they own it.  Oh, no, wait.  I mean, they own it.  They're like, oh,  oh, he fucking  coughed it up.  Every time.  I don't care if he scored  48.  He choked with two minutes  left.  It is three.  Okay.  What a hunk of shit.  Brady has three Super Bowls.  And he could have easily  had another one in there.  How many has he lost? 
[00:48:30]  The one, the Giants one?  The Giants one?  Yeah, well, I mean,  that was a catch.  Yeah.  He could easily have that one.  It was more of a catch.  Well, that's debatable.  How many has he lost?  Two?  I'm not sure.  At least one.  Who knows their Brady shit?  No, he's lost at least two.  Well, I mean,  I just say at least one  because I know of that one.  Patriot.  Both to the Giants, right?  One to the Giants  and one...  At least two.  Who did they just lose to?  Oh, Christ.  Who?  I don't know.  Mau. 
[00:49:00]  I'll give it to Sam Roberts' answer.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Mau.  When we're stuck,  we just have to say,  I want to see the boat movie.  Boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  That space movie  beat the boat movie?  I want to see the boat movie.  Space movie.  Hey, hey, hey.  Man.  Could someone help us out on Twitter?  How many fucking Super Bowls  has Brady lost?  I say...  Lost? 
[00:49:30]  At least two, right?  Yeah, three and two.  Thank you, Nick's Hex  on Twitter.  Yeah, Brady's three and two  in Super Bowls.  Okay.  Gotta unwrap my toast  before it gets soggy.  Huh?  Wrapping tin foil.  It was ten years ago  he's lost to the Rams.  Jesus.  Romo?  I mean, um...  Homo?  Brady, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Pats just don't have receivers.  No.  They're in a tough spot this year.  It's nice to watch them lose.  Especially in the pouring rain. 
[00:50:00]  You like that?  I got some roots up there.  I do like that.  I'm taking a little look  at the Patriots  every once in a while.  Got some roots.  No, I can choke on this.  You're still upset about that.  No, but he's another baby.  He's another baby.  This is why football fans  are fucking dumb cocksuckers.  World's worst tweets.  Shut up about Tony Romo.  He threw for 500 yards  and five touchdowns.  He lost to a team  that's going to win  the Super Bowl.  Exactly, you dumb cocksucker. 
[00:50:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's exactly my point.  Thank you.  Big shit.  And he just, once again,  if it's not doing this,  it's fucking...  The ball for the kick.  When he couldn't hold  the fucking kick.  Romo...  Romo...  Panic.  He panics in really  important situations.  That's Jimmy's point.  You made my point.  Right.  There's a lot of quarterbacks  that have a great skill set, 
[00:51:00]  but they don't have  something inside.  The heart.  The heart.  That every fucking announcer  has talked about  since the beginning of time.  Gotta have that heart, too.  And how about he doesn't throw that...  You gotta have ice in your veins  when it matters.  How about he doesn't throw  that interception,  you fucking dummy?  How about for once  he beats that great team  and marches the team  down the field?  How about for once  he's a leader?  For real.  He gets you right there.  He gets you right there.  And then as you're  about to come,  he's the phone ringing. 
[00:51:30]  That's what he is.  He's a warm, wet pussy.  And then you're about  to shoot.  And you see your mom  come up on the caller ID.  You're going great.  And to finish up football,  Obama's in on  the Redskins thing now.  God, it's just so annoying.  I look at the TV  when I see him talking about it.  I'm like,  what year is this?  They just decided  to have a problem  only recently.  I think there's more  important things  for him to be fucking  commenting on.  I think he was 
[00:52:00]  asking the question.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  But he wants the Redskins  to change their name.  He said he would  think about it  if he owned the team.  If he was the owner.  Yeah, you're right.  If he was the owner  of the team,  he would think about it.  If people were offended.  They're not backing down.  They immediately  released a statement  saying we're not  changing the name.  Cool.  Let's see them  show those balls  when one of their players  says something racial.  If they do that,  I'll respect the Redskins.  I just respect  the Redskins.  Enough of this shit.  You gotta stop this shit. 
[00:52:30]  I don't think  they should change it.  That's ridiculous.  They will eventually, though.  Of course they will.  They will eventually.  Eventually they will.  They'll be a new owner  eventually that's  a little more sensitive  down the road  or whatever.  Of course they're  going to change  the name eventually.  I hope they don't  anytime soon, though.  The Redskins team,  they said,  as a supporter  of President Obama,  I'm sure the president  is not aware  that in the highly respected  Independent Annenberg Institute 
[00:53:00]  poll taken in 2004  with a national sample  of Native Americans,  nine out of ten  Native Americans  said they were not bothered  by the name  Washington Redskins.  I believe that, too.  Cool.  We live in a world  where it's the  fucking tiny minority.  I know we sound  like broken records,  but that's a fact.  And then there was  an AP poll this year  that four out of five  Americans don't think  it's a big deal.  Most people probably don't.  How was Miley Cyrus  on SNL?  I see a clip up there.  Very funny.  She was funny, huh?  I got a DVR. 
[00:53:30]  I heard there were  some good skits.  With time on your table!  Shut up.  Hey, I hear,  is this true that  the number for Obamacare  is 1-800-FUCK-FUCKU?  No, isn't there...  What?  I saw that on the news.  Is that a joke  or is it real?  No, Drudge put that up,  but I think there's a one.  It's like F1-U-C-Y-O-U  or something like that.  Really?  Yeah, like it's  a little misleading.  I thought it was  fuck you. 
[00:54:00]  Or fuck yo.  I mean, you can take  any number.  Leave the last you off  for up your ass.  You can take any number  and make it into something.  Yeah, but it's pretty odd  if it's fuck you.  It's actually F-1-U-C-K-Y-O.  Oh.  Fuck yo.  But Drudge put up a thing that said F-U-C-K-Y-O.  All right.  Yeah, because that makes for a better headline.  And then everybody went kind of next to it.  You see it the other way, and it doesn't even come close to looking like fuck.  Yeah, there's a one in there that a lot of people are.  I was wondering about that.  That's fuck you, though.  It is pretty close.  F-1-U, fuck you. 
[00:54:30]  That's absolutely fuck you.  It's F-1-U-C-K-Y-O.  Why would they make it that?  Yeah, dude, that's a big ‚Äì I could see if it was like just a K or ‚Äì that's ‚Äì it's literally fuck you.  You could see fuck you, yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  That's a coincidence.  Fuck you.  That's a dumb coincidence.  It's pretty funny.  Oh.  It is funny, though, that somebody sat by their ‚Äì  But it's misleading that Judge takes the one out of the thing.  Yeah, and somebody sat by their phone trying to figure out every possible combination to fuck over Obama. 
[00:55:00]  And then got excited that they almost have it.  Right, and so then they just deleted a number.  Yeah.  And just made it work.  Fuck you.  What are we supposed to do with Obamacare?  Are we good?  I don't even know.  Are we supposed to adjust to all our shit?  How does that work?  I don't even know how this works.  No, you've got to keep your current health care provider, and it doesn't cost the country a dime.  That's what was promised.  Nice.  Well, that's right.  Uh-oh.  It's not ‚Äì that's not happening. 
[00:55:30]  And apparently people are, like, all up and on saying, wait a minute.  I thought this was affordable health care.  It's apparently very expensive.  Oh.  Like, people are saying, I'm not getting this insurance.  It's too expensive.  So now they have to pay the fine at the end of the year when they do their taxes.  That's a clusterfuck.  Yeah.  Healthcare.gov.  Yeah, they are.  Look, there's a couple Asian people there looking all nice.  It just doesn't seem like it was ready to be rolled out. 
[00:56:00]  I wouldn't mind a little health care for the masses, but ‚Äì  I'm nowhere near as right as you, but I can't understand how you can fine people for not buying health care.  The only problem I have with them is that they're the ones who jack up our costs when they get their fucking leg cut off or they get cancer, and we have to pay for them.  And then it's like ‚Äì because they know we're going to pay for them.  That's what drives me crazy.  Don't pay the fine, but then if you get cancer, fuck you.  Can I take the other side of that argument? 
[00:56:30]  That would be all well and good if then our costs go down, but our costs will never go down.  You know, that ‚Äì we all know why we paid so much, and it's because of Jimmy's point.  But now that we're taking care of that and making people pay and fining them and stuff, you watch.  Our shit won't go down.  That's why the Supreme Court had to dub it a tax because you can't ‚Äì a government entity cannot force you to buy something.  That's what they're doing.  No, they're not.  It's just a tax.  Oh.  See? 
[00:57:00]  They're all in cahoots.  I get it.  There's always a workaround.  Yes.  Attacks.  Attacks.  Is it true the government shut down?  They got rid of Amber Alerts now?  No, they shut down.  Was that real?  Part of what shut down, I think, was that.  No, they didn't get rid of them.  Not rid of them, but for now.  Oh, look.  Amber ‚Äì okay.  Amber Alert website offline due to shutdown.  Yeah.  That ‚Äì the CDC stopped tracking the flu.  Really?  Yeah, shit like that.  Little government things.  Little things.  That's important. 
[00:57:30]  But it doesn't matter where the flu goes.  We all end up getting it.  So we don't really need it tracked anyways.  But the Amber website is down.  Oh, God.  We're just disgusting.  Yeah.  We're just disgusting human beings.  Yeah, they're trying to figure this out.  Good luck.  We lost kids out there, so, like, yeah, but, you know, the government shut down.  The TSA is trying to blame that, like, the nine-year-old getting onto that plane the other day.  Oh, right, yeah.  Because there's so many furloughed, because there's so many furloughed that they were short-staffed.  Yeah, that sounds like something. 
[00:58:00]  So a kid was just able to walk through the airport.  Our politicians are disgusting.  They are disgusting.  False flag.  They're just disgusting fucking people.  That kid just walked on a plane?  Yeah.  How did anybody do that?  Through security, through boarding, right onto a plane.  No ticket.  How does a kid do that?  That's pretty cool.  Yes.  Damn.  No idea.  It's really short.  It's the furloughs.  No end in sight, right?  So when does this start getting real ugly?  We had a guy set himself on fire down there in Washington on Friday after our radio show. 
[00:58:30]  Is he dead, or did he get pooped?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, he ended up dying?  Yeah.  He wasn't dead at first.  They have to identify him by dental records.  What the fuck?  Last I heard, he was still alive.  No, he's dead.  Yeah, he did one of those fucking...  You gotta really hate yourself to put yourself on fire.  Because that's not an instant thing.  Oh, my God.  That was something on that Richard Pryor documentary talking about that.  He was just watching the Buddhist monk set himself on fire and how he didn't even flinch. 
[00:59:00]  And then he fucking...  His buddy's outside and he just sees on fire Richard Pryor screaming, running past him.  Well, the Buddhist monk prepared himself for the ultimate fucking...  Yeah.  Out.  Pryor probably thought your senses all just die immediately and you zone out and burn.  Well, the Buddhist monk, you know, years and years of training learned how to, like, slow everything the fuck down.  Richard Pryor is doing lines before he sets himself on fire.  The complete opposite.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:59:30]  You don't think the monks were freebasing before they...  No.  Probably not.  No.  Because you gotta keep that heart nice and chill.  Wow.  Man.  All right.  We got Chuck Tover today.  We got, um...  Mmm.  We got the Fox Philly broad.  That's stupid.  What a typical dummy.  They're all stupid.  We all know that.  News people are just stupid.  Who's not stupid on the news?  Their news rebus.  That's a very good question.  The local people are just stupid.  Piers Morgan seemed smart when he was in here. 
[01:00:00]  I know you don't agree with him on everything, but he did...  He's an intellect, at least.  Yeah, he came across as intelligent.  If he was intelligent, he'd be able to fucking put two and two together.  He can't.  Very good, Chippa.  Chippa's very smart.  But most of them are just dumb, stupid news readers.  Oh, yeah.  But she's great.  Like, to me, she's honest in a way.  Like, that's what the media is.  The media is everything that she is when she tweeted.  That's who and what they are.  Of course.  They're just fucking pigs. 
[01:00:30]  They're pigs.  Nancy Grace with her hashtags for her show.  Yeah.  Every time.  Trash baby.  Toilet baby.  Toilet baby.  Dumpster baby.  Fucking.  Ugh.  I thought you were making that up when you retweeted her with the toilet baby thing.  No, it was toilet baby.  I don't know how any serious person can create that hashtag.  What a cunt she is.  Toilet baby.  Nancy Grace is a capitalizing cunt.  It's disgusting.  Like...  And people watch her, though.  Yeah.  People love her.  Worse than Nancy Grace starting that is all the people that were...  Hashtagging toilet baby.  Seriously. 
[01:01:00]  Seriously.  Oh, we've got to find out who killed toilet baby.  It's really like an episode of South Park.  Yeah.  Toilet baby, indeed.  Is Pat Cooper coming in today?  What?  Next week.  Oh, that's next week.  It was supposed to be today, but it's next week.  Oh, okay.  Who told you that?  All right.  Could be the last appearance from Pat Cooper.  Wow.  Wow.  We'll see.  They were birthed.  Okay.  Both to the Giants he lost. 
[01:01:30]  Brady lost to the Giants twice.  I know he lost to the Giants twice.  I feel like there was a third one in there.  That's why I got confused.  So, I guess he's officially three and two in Super Bowls.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  Someone's saying the government has used that phone number since 1999.  The fuck your number.  All right.  But blame Obama.  Who was in office in 1999?  Who had the sense of humor in 1999?  I was talking Clinton around then, right?  No.  George W. 
[01:02:00]  No.  George W.  Not yet.  He was 2000.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was Clinton.  Okay.  That makes sense.  He probably would have done that.  Yeah.  Blow me.  This is last year.  Right.  Fuck you.  Sir, blow me is taken.  Fuck you.  Gore's like, come on, dude.  We just made this easier for me.  Come on.  Fuck you, Al.  No, it'll be funny.  I'm going to lose the election by a couple of votes if you do this.  He's the best. 
[01:02:30]  Crows and balls, Al.  Hey.  Also, when we get back, we've got to talk about the biker guys.  Oh, God.  That whole situation.  Upstanding citizens.  All you needed to know is in that picture on the cover of the post.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's all you needed.  We'll discuss that next.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I did get you in a compromising position.  Yeah, they like to get you there smiling in your face.  Yeah, they think it's so cheap when they got you in bad condition.  Well, I think it's a total disgrace. 
[01:03:30]  And they'll fight.  I fought the law and the law won.  I fought the authority, authority, always wins.  I like singing everything like Paul Williams now.  Melonhead is 62 today.  John Cougar, Melonhead.  We used to like to say that on rock radio.  Ah.  Here's some John Melonhead. 
[01:04:00]  Melonhead.  62, huh?  62?  Yep.  Damn.  Fox News started on this day back in, let me do the math, 1996, I think.  Faux News.  The Faux News.  Faux News.  Boy.  Speaking of faux news, the Fox Affiliate, which is different from Fox News, which is kind of strange to me, right? 
[01:04:30]  You got Fox and their affiliates, then you got Fox News.  Right.  Fox and Philly.  I guess Jimmy had a little fun with this, huh?  Oh, yeah.  She was very, very irritating.  I only saw the tweet when I woke up this morning.  It all went down, what, last night?  Yeah, at one point she tweeted.  Did, uh...  Let's explain to the people here, please.  Something, I'll actually give you the exact tweet here, if I can go back on my Twitter feed. 
[01:05:00]  Sam, do you have the exact tweet?  This woman, uh...  Uh, she wrote, she wrote, thought Breaking Bad was hot last Sunday at Fox 29 Philly.  See who's breaking bad in Southwest Philly, leaving six people shot tonight at 10.  This cunt was using a real shooting, a ham-handed fucking pop culture reference to sell a real 
[01:05:30]  shooting story.  She tried to shoehorn it in and use Breaking Bad.  Are you finally over that Breaking Bad crap?  Once the show's end, I'm done.  You're done, right?  That was a stupid show.  All right.  Anyway.  Yeah, once, uh, like, like, you know, Sopranos lost, all that.  It's over, it's over.  So I gave her the business.  Wait, I want to read it again.  Thought Breaking Bad was hot last Sunday.  Fox 29 Philly.  See who's breaking bad in Southwest Philly, leaving six people shot tonight at 10. 
[01:06:00]  But then look at what she actually backtracks.  This is why she's fucking really irritating.  Right.  Thank God there's no, I mean, I, you know, our listeners have more followers than a news  broad in Philly.  Yeah.  How pathetic is that?  Uh, she wrote last tweet.  First of all, she's a moron.  She wrote last tweet, not asked all a joke, meaning not at all.  Very real life drama was the point as opposed to one that ended on TV. 
[01:06:30]  I don't think she was joking.  I don't think she was trying to be funny.  I think she was trying to just use a clever tie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She wrote her fucking twat network.  Yeah.  She wasn't making fun of it.  That's sickening.  And those teases don't work.  They all, we all know now that a big story in your town, excuse me, the, the, the, the  big three news channels are going to cover it almost exactly the same.  We all know that now.  There's nothing special about any of these fucking news channels.  It's interesting how the press is not all over this though.  Like if it was a comic or a radio show said something, every station would be carrying 
[01:07:00]  it.  They have to protect their own.  But one of their own fucking tweets something stupid and they back off.  Yeah.  They're just hateable.  You went after a little bit, Jimmy.  Oh yeah.  And it's because again, I don't want to see her get fired, but I just, they're the people  that go after us.  They're the people that will reshow the clip over and over.  Can you believe he said that?  Oh, I have a hard time believing that.  Where's all the fucking news banter with this one?  They won't even show the whole clip, by the way.  They'll find that little piece that makes it way worse and replay that a million times. 
[01:07:30]  Where, where, where is the, uh, they're saying she's in hot water with who?  Who's she in hot water with?  Yeah.  What?  What?  She's taking a bath.  She's in hot water.  Look out.  And, um.  Fifty shells?  I believe a six people shot in, uh.  Fifty shells?  Really?  How many, how many shooters?  I don't know, but.  In front of a deli?  Unlike Breaking Bad, there's no, uh, no white involved in this one. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, how bad was the sandwich in front of a deli?  What the hell?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What do they get wrong on the sandwich?  I don't know.  That's some angry motherfucker.  What is it?  More black guys fucking slinging lead at each other?  In another fucking, uh.  Southwest Philly?  Urban area?  Holy Toledo.  Southwest Philly is a bit scary.  It's like this fucking, uh, the motorcycle guy that was beating the fucking window with  his helmet to break it with that guy, uh, that the motorcycle gang was chasing the SUV. 
[01:08:30]  And, uh, apparently they arraigned this guy, and he's got fucking a hell of a record.  Drug charges, gun charges, assault, robbery.  Why the fuck is he out?  He's a fucking thug criminal.  And then gives everyone the finger, double, double, middle fingers.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  That's great.  Like Lamar.  Like Lamar.  That guy looks scary. 
[01:09:00]  Of course he does.  And he's out.  Not now he's in jail, right?  I think he's in jail now.  He was out.  Yeah, he was out.  Oh, you mean why was he out on all that other shit?  Is that what you're saying to him?  Yeah.  Chance.  His name is Chance.  Um, well, that's his last name.  Uh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, insult to injury, this gesture in court.  Yeah, he flipped the bird.  It emerged.  He had faced 25 years in prison earlier this year, but got only community service under a  deal approved by Judge Suzanne Mondo. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Probably some liberal ass, dumb fuck bitch.  Could get 25 years, gets, community service.  Gets litter duty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shouldn't be sense.  Oh, whatever.  Put him in prison.  How does that make sense?  Put him in the prison.  Well, why does the judge who looks like Howard Stern, she really is an ugly woman.  Ooh.  Why, uh, why is she?  Yeah, Howard is.  How are they not fucking called into a, how do they have to answer for this shit? 
[01:10:00]  It's weird.  I mean, if he's facing 25, you can't give him a couple.  Wouldn't that be a nice deal?  Judge Suzanne Mondo.  If you were facing 25 years and a judge goes, look, I'm going to, I'm only going to give  you two.  You'd be happy.  Yeah.  But it goes all the way down to, to community service.  That's, that's fucked up.  She had granted no jail plea deal to Reginald Chance here.  Um, uh, for a previous case, April 26th, 2013, charged with drug and gun crimes. 
[01:10:30]  After allegedly selling cocaine through middleman to an undercover bed, a cop in Bed-Stuy, plea  bargain to one year conditional discharge on a misdemeanor count of pot possession, along  with 20 days of community service for a six month suspended and a six month suspension  of his driver's license.  Uh, and then June of 95 charged with robbery and an incident in Bed-Stuy 94 charged with  attempted robbery for allegedly using a handgun to demand cash from a victim. 
[01:11:00]  He was caught 15 minutes for it later records for the 18 other arrests on charges, including  armed robbery, weapons possession, and drug possession with intent to sell are sealed.  What a worthless non-contributor.  This guy is a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Who should be just locked away.  Yeah.  Just lock him away.  So he, uh, he can't ruin the civilized people's fucking shot at life. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Just an absolute non-contributor.  Wow.  And they just, there's so many people like this that are out.  Unbelievable.  Then you hear from Reverend Allen stuff and they'll say that the, you know, the incarceration  rate is, uh, way too high for a black man.  And well, sorry, look what the fuck you're doing.  Jesus.  Apparently not high enough.  This guy's out running around.  Man, you got all sorts of priors and you, you're fucking pulling people out of SUVs. 
[01:12:00]  There's no thought process there.  This guy doesn't have a thought process.  He doesn't think about consequences or fucking, uh, human life or anything.  He's fucking, I don't know.  He's a dumb, selfish asshole.  I don't understand the mindset of people.  Like if, if I get a speeding ticket, I'm 10 and two for like six straight months.  I'm a fucking, I'm petrified now, just from that dumb shit, fucking petrified driving. 
[01:12:30]  I take my little chance.  I got caught finally.  And then I got to go 10 and two.  I can't afford another fucking ticket with any points on it.  But this guy has all the priors and he's taking like, just assuming that he's in the  right in this situation.  Yeah.  I'm going to drag this fucking guy out of his car and beat the shit out of him.  Even though I have fucking gun charges, drug charges, conditional release.  Yeah.  I wonder who started the whole incident.  Was it the guy driving with his wife and two year old or this guy with the fucking gun  and drug?  Like just an animal. 
[01:13:00]  Well, people are trying to spin it and say that the SUV guy is the problem.  Yeah.  I cannot, I for one cannot possibly see it that way.  I can't imagine seeing it that way right now.  No, it definitely looks like, uh, knowing that, you know, it's a day where these guys  are going to, you know, cause some, cause some situations.  You know, something tells me this wasn't the only, you know, bad guy in that group of  gentlemen on the motorcycles either.  I bet if you randomly pulled 10 of them out of there, at least nine would have fucking 
[01:13:30]  some type of record.  And they're saying there were cops now.  And how many were cops?  Were there?  There's a deep cover.  There were four cops.  Uh, and I'm not sure of how many were undercover, but there were working.  They were working this group of guys, this group of motorcycle guys.  Cause they've had it infiltrating them and trying to see what their deal is as far as  gang activity, drugs, weapons.  Cause they do this every year.  They've had it.  The videos are all over YouTube.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  And so finally the NYPD got involved and said, all right, what can we find out about these  guys?  Enough already.  Yeah.  But were they close to the situation at hand that went down?  Uh, I'm not sure how close they were, but they admitted that they didn't stop it.  So they, they knew, I guess they knew it was going on and they didn't stop it.  I guess they put a couple of them on, uh, on leave pending an investigation.  It is weird.  If you've been working a fucking undercover gig for a while, you don't want to blow it. 
[01:14:30]  I guess on, you know, you have no choice.  I mean, there's a biggie.  Maybe you're afraid to blow it there.  Cause you're afraid you'll be killed by, by you're surrounded by 30 guys.  But how do you not try to back the guy off?  Maybe just step in and go, Hey, what the fuck are you doing, man?  Oh, be cool.  The cops are coming.  The cops, you know, who I'm not one of, they could show up any minute now.  The police, who I don't like either.  The worst undercover cop ever.  Yeah.  I hate those coppers.  Yeah.  The damn fuzz might come. 
[01:15:00]  It's bad.  Just falling out of his boot.  Here's the police radio.  Crackling.  Crackling.  Double Bird Biker was released by Soft Judge is the headline.  Motor Psycho.  They're calling him.  Motor Psycho.  I get it.  Soft Judge.  Oh, look at her face.  Another soft judge.  Doesn't she look like a fucking soft, out of touch old lady?  She probably is fucking one of these loves, loves like fucking young black cock.  And she fucking, you know, Oh, maybe I could get a little in with him. 
[01:15:30]  It's not true.  Oh, what's the matter?  Hey, do you think, or is that the prosecutor?  Is that, maybe that's not the judge.  Maybe it's the prosecutor.  She has to okay it, but maybe the prosecutor said, this is what we want to do.  And she just okays those things.  I don't know.  They're pinnitent on the judge here.  Suzanne Mondo.  They have so many liberal fucking judges that let these guys give them chances.  Oh, you can go.  Oh, we'll put you in a program.  We'll do this. 
[01:16:00]  Lock them up.  Throw away the key, I say.  Want to hear a different angle?  All right.  We do try to get some different angles on.  It doesn't sound like it sometimes.  Mr. Chance, you're on the phone.  Mike in Virginia, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  First of all, you guys are a thousand percent right.  The cocksuckers never should have been out.  But if you just take what actually, what happened, the guy on the motorcycle that was hit by the SUV is now paralyzed.  And I had a friend of mine about 25 years ago that was hit by a car and killed. 
[01:16:30]  And when that happened, I'm a fine, upstanding white man and went to Catholic school and the whole bit.  But when that happened, all my friends around him ripped the guy out of the car and started pummeling the guy in the car.  So it was a very similar reaction, a raw emotional reaction.  Now, you're right.  The guy never should have been out.  He's a savage and whatnot.  But that raw reaction, I could see why he acted like that.  Dude, the only reason he ran him over was because the gang had stopped the SUV and he was panicking and trying to get away from them. 
[01:17:00]  It wasn't like, you know what I'm saying?  Yes, I agree.  So I'm talking about the instance when the guy was hit.  That when your friend is hit like that, you don't.  Yeah, is he hit just driving around or is he hit being an asshole?  Like when your friend got killed, was he just riding and got hit or was he fucking jamming on the brakes in front of an SUV?  No, no, he was walking in the street.  He should have been on a main road, up a turnpike, as a matter of fact. 
[01:17:30]  And he was killed there.  So he was in the wrong.  My friend was wrong because he should have been in the middle of the road.  But there's a difference between walking in the road and menacing people.  Right, right.  They stopped the guy on a highway.  Nothing good could come out of that.  If he was in the middle of the road whipping rocks at cars and he got hit, people would be like, oh, fuck him.  No, no, you're right.  I'm not trying to say that these motorcycle guys were right.  I'm just trying to say that their raw emotion, when it happened, they don't care what caused it.  You know, when it happened, you don't care what caused the accident, what caused the guy to get hit. 
[01:18:00]  You're not thinking, especially these people, these savages, they're not thinking about, oh, my God, he stopped short in front of the SUV, so he was in the wrong.  So I'm not going to be the shit out of the car.  Well, they're going to have to, you know, they're going to have to answer for that.  Hold on.  This guy wants in badly.  Josh, you're on with Mike.  Go ahead, Josh.  The guy that got paralyzed is not the guy that gave the SUV the brake job.  The guy that got paralyzed was the one helping him pick up the bike.  So he was just out there helping him.  But on another note, this guy, that guy that gave the two birds, he's a real outstanding citizen. 
[01:18:30]  He's a father of six.  Been out of work since 2011, so how is he affording that bike?  That's what I want to know.  Well, and by the way, the guy helping pull the bike out, whoever it was, he was with those guys, and the guy was panicking and driving away.  He wasn't, like, it was not like he was fucking aiming for him.  He was just driving away with his family, being surrounded by these fucking animals.  Exactly.  Of course.  These are fucking animals that seem to be just wiped off the face of the earth.  It's fucking annoying. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I was running over to the truck I'm driving.  All right.  I agree with pretty much all of that.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  I got to let you go.  Thank you.  Thank you, buddy.  Dave in Atlanta.  Dave, go ahead.  You're a biker.  What's up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And whether the guy should have been out of jail or not, I mean, that's a whole other issue.  But when you watch the original video from the beginning, like the whole nine-minute one or whatever, you see that guy doing a brake check.  I mean, he's riding right in front of the car, keeps it slowing down. 
[01:19:30]  And all the guy did was clip his back tire and put him down.  That guy would have walked away from that.  I've crashed on a racetrack.  I've crashed on the street.  He didn't go down that hard.  And he caused it.  I mean, if you're in front of a car, you're going to lose the battle against a car every frigging time.  So doing a brake check to a car, you're a retard for doing that.  Yeah.  Everybody then surrounding the guy, if I was, you know, I'm not racist and stuff, but if I got 30 angry or 50 angry black bikers surrounding my car and yelling at me to get out, you know, in Atlanta here, I'd be firing in self-defense at that point probably as soon as the surprise opened the car door. 
[01:20:00]  Dude, fucking 50 white guys on bikes, I would be, 50 anything on bikes, 50 lesbians on motorcycles, anything on a, 50 on a motorcycle would scare me.  50 of anything.  Yeah.  50 of anything is frightening.  Not lipstick lesbians.  I mean, if it's the ugly ones, yeah.  Yeah, you're probably wrong.  Still.  Remember that?  I don't see that guy.  When you, when a guy's got, oh, he's got his two bikes in front of him, but he's got 50 bikes to the side and behind. 
[01:20:30]  That guy had no way out.  He had nowhere to go but forward.  And if I had a wife and a kid in the car, I'm not sticking around to see what happens and see if these guys are going to, you know, just talk it out.  You know, you've got it and hope for the best, I think, at that point.  Jimmy's right, he panicked.  Yeah, put yourself in that situation, you know.  I mean, honestly, think of how you would react in that situation with the, the actual, you know, fear that that guy must have had.  Jam on the fucking gas.  Get the fuck out of there. 
[01:21:00]  Use that vehicle.  And they, uh, yeah, I mean, what he, what he should have done, I mean, I say it's easy to say, is started doing that S pattern, weaving back and forth on the fucking road, but he had his fucking tires slashed.  Now, I've, I've heard, someone told me that he had hit one of them before any of that video started.  But again, what were they doing before that he hit them?  Was he at fault?  This before the video.  There's a, there's a, there's a full length video and you'll see.  Okay.  The first guy that got hit, which was where they stopped before he then gunned it and, and drove over a couple of the bikes and, and, and guys, there was a guy that was right in front of him that kept. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, we saw that.  No, I don't mean that guy, dude.  I don't mean that guy.  I know which guy you mean.  I don't mean that.  Someone told me that like on 150 something street, he had, you know, somewhere on one of the side streets that there'd been an incident.  And that was why, but I, again, I want to know what was happening before that.  Cause those guys, were they surrounding him first or were they just driving?  And was he a careless idiot who merged without looking?  What do you mean?  There was an incident on 155th street. 
[01:22:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  That was prior because this is the West side highway.  So that that's way before 155.  Right.  I don't know.  He was heading up that way.  It was, it was somewhere on a side street was what someone told me that there was something that happened.  One of the news reports also had, um, they said that those guys, they typically do this.  They slow down traffic to a crawl.  They had a couple of guys ahead closing off kind of blocking exits, our entrance ramps onto the highway.  So they could sit there and do wheelies and stunts and basically just take over the road. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Like thugs will do drag racing.  You know, they on the road and, and, and so that, you know, that's what they were trying to do was stop the traffic so that they had the whole road to themselves to just, you know, goof around and be idiots.  And so that's why they were trying to stop him.  It wasn't trying to stop him specifically.  It just happened that they were trying to stop all the traffic and that guy break too hard and he got clipped.  Fuck him.  Well, whatever.  I mean, I don't know what, uh, I had heard there was something else, so it'll all come out, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Just more thugs.  Hey, Jimmy, when you, when you, when you come into Atlanta next, I've seen you at the punchline a few times. 
[01:23:00]  I always love the show.  Thank you, buddy.  I don't know.  I don't have any Atlanta plans.  I'm just working on material now.  So hopefully, uh, early in the new year.  Yeah.  So relax.  Yeah.  I'll be in the ATL again.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Did you, uh, did you hear about that, uh, the, uh, story about that guy who had that,  I guess he was, uh, 16 months old or something.  That kid that was shot that he was in the stroller and the father was pushing him in the stroller  and he got shot.  Yes.  Uh, well that, that father, uh, was just arrested for a robbery with his brother on 
[01:23:30]  a subway gunpoint, fucking stole some guy's watch and phone and shit.  He just has his fucking.  Wait, what story is this?  This was the gang related shooting.  Yeah.  The shooting.  He got his kid named.  His kid's name was antique.  And his, and the kid ended up getting shot in the, in the drive by or whatever.  Right.  And they said that, uh, he was the intended target, the father.  And they didn't understand why this went down and all that and why he was targeted.  And the father, I remember the story.  Sure.  Okay. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Father wouldn't help the cops.  And now he's, uh, he was arrested for a robbery.  It's just this fucking mentality that has to fucking, something has to be done.  How the fuck do you, the kid, it was in September.  It was last month.  He loses his fucking kid to, to a fucking bullet in the head.  And then he's just out robbing still another useless piece of shit burden that should  just be locked up or eliminated. 
[01:24:30]  Ugh.  Disgusting.  Oh my God.  It could be a paradise.  Paradise.  Jesus.  I don't know if the world's ready for more kumias.  Oh, please.  That would be a wonderful world.  Clone the kumias.  Ah, clone me.  Kumi is not ready for another kumia.  No, I don't think you can handle another one of you even.  Right.  A cat.  Yeah.  And then, uh, what my brother and sister came over yesterday with their kids and, uh, 
[01:25:00]  oh my God.  I was, you know, I was feeling a little hungover and man, kids don't shut up.  Wow.  Are they fucking loud?  You're not kidding.  Wow.  They're screaming, running around.  Even my brother was just like, all right, enough.  Were you cranky?  No, I was just laying there like, oh God, do they ever shut the fuck up?  Poor Beavis is running around.  They're chasing him, picking him up constantly.  Oh my God. 
[01:25:30]  Are you worried?  Poor little Beav alone.  Yeah, who knows?  They're going to come up.  The cat's not moving anymore.  Fucking dumb kids.  What do they know?  We threw the cat down the steps.  He's sleeping.  Yeah.  Well, they fucking take him into the theater and go to put the seats back and crush his  little head.  Like there's so many pitfalls.  You got to lock him up.  Yeah.  Well, I lock him up and he cries.  So I make sure he's with me.  I don't let him go downstairs with the kids alone like that, not in the theater.  A lot of parents stop drinking because kids don't understand hangovers. 
[01:26:00]  You know that, right?  Fuck that.  If you're a parent trying to do the right thing, you end up, you really stop drinking  because you know you have to be up at fucking six in the morning with that horrible hangover.  Fuck that.  So it makes a lot of parents stop drinking for a while.  Just got to fucking, a kid would be handy if you could just open a can of food and throw  it in a bowl on the floor.  That's the only responsibility I want.  Which is weird because the kids could drive you to drink.  So it's like this weird, it's a weird balancing act, man. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I was having a few on Saturday and then I was thinking, you know what?  These kids are going to be up at six.  So I just stopped.  I'm like, no, I can't do this.  Oof.  I can't be, you know, hungover with four or five hours sleep.  Do you get zooted?  No zooted.  Zooted.  No zooted.  Oh, we got the Philly story.  What?  There was another piece to that.  This isn't the tease, right?  No, this is just this story that I just figured just for some context.  And what were some of your tweets about this yesterday, Jimmy?  Because people said they were pretty funny and on point at the same time. 
[01:27:00]  I was just using other tragedies to tie into kind of like pop culture references.  Are you just doing what she was doing?  Yes.  That's exactly what I was doing.  You know what?  That's exactly what I was doing.  Thank you, Twitter person.  I was doing that.  Twitter person.  Just things like I tweeted her and I wrote like, do you think the king of Prussia mall 
[01:27:30]  has long lines?  Wait till we tell you what happened in Kenya tonight at 10.  Yeah, things like that.  Things like that.  Yeah.  To make the example of what a piggish thing she did to promote the news that way.  Pretty damn similar.  Yeah.  So the tweet once again, because people might be tuning in, it's out of Philly.  Newslady goes, thought Breaking Bad was hot last Sunday.  Fox 29 Philly, that's the Twitter account, at Fox 29 Philly.  See who's Breaking Bad in Southwest Philly, leaving six people shot tonight at 10. 
[01:28:00]  That was Fox 29 anchor Joyce Evans.  And here's the actual news story from Philly.  First at 10 tonight, a developing story in Philadelphia's King Sessing neighborhood.  A shooting kills one person and sends five others to the hospital.  And we're told one is not doing well.  Good evening, everybody.  I'm Joyce Evans.  Now, police are still piecing together clues at this hour.  It all went down just after 8 o'clock tonight. 
[01:28:30]  Fox 29's Dave Kenshin is live near the scene with the very latest on this.  A horrible night out there, Dave.  What went down?  Yeah, Joyce, it really is.  Police are saying they've never seen anything like this before.  Police out of the 12th District in the King Sessing neighborhood is where we are.  And we can tell you that police are telling us this went down in an ambush-style attack.  Let me step out of the way.  You can see police still on the scene right here.  We know one person is dead.  One is in critical condition at an area hospital. 
[01:29:00]  Four others in stable condition also at area hospitals.  Yeah, but that's the pop culture.  But, boy, fucking, you know, Tosh does a rape joke in a comedy club.  And there's not even audio of it, and they cannot get enough talking about it.  Where's the press talking about this?  They're fucking hateable.  It's par for the course, as they say.  Yeah.  They will never fucking rail on their own.  And they're so not used to being called out. 
[01:29:30]  This is the beauty of attacking them.  They're not used to it.  No.  They're just radio people used to it.  And she instantly got all defensive, huh?  Hey, you missed my point.  I'm making a point.  Oh, sure you are.  That's a typical way to, like, backtrack.  Right.  No.  Are you, Joyce?  That's Kramer up on stage going, see, words!  These are all words!  Like, he finally realized what he did and was trying to get out of it.  Yeah.  Was it Joyce? 
[01:30:00]  There you go.  Six people shot, and people just don't even fucking...  You'll never hear about it again.  You'll never hear about it.  Chicago, it's fucking...  It's just...  We need a dialogue.  We need to open a dialogue about...  No, you don't.  You need to start racking some head.  Martial law!  Who's he?  We love just avoiding problems by...  Oh, God.  ...just saying bullshit, like...  You need to... 
[01:30:30]  Open a dialogue.  Open dialogue.  We need to allocate more resources to the areas in need.  What does that mean?  How about allocate more fucking people with guns to eliminate the problem?  Get some of those robots we just saw on CNN.  Oh, the running robot.  You have those...  Put machine guns on them.  You have some of those walking around those neighborhoods.  Holy shit.  Man.  People will stay indoors.  Man, that thing just turning a corner out of an alley?  Right.  Because most people won't even know what the fuck it is.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:31:00]  Starts galloping after you.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I wonder if we'll get to a point where those things are just wandering around.  Little RoboCop, yeah.  To keep everyone behaving.  Yeah.  Of course, like RoboCop.  Looking for me.  That thing is...  Sudden, Sudden.  And they made it look like it had, like, fucking big fucking muscles.  Yeah, yeah.  Leg muscles.  It looks like some kind of fucking bovine thing.  They made it try to look impressive.  Yeah.  That's next.  That's fucking next, man.  Next.  They're doing it in...  Where was that? 
[01:31:30]  Afghanistan?  Afghanistan, or...  Yeah, I think so.  It just follows a soldier with...  So it's some nice little GPS thing on him?  Yeah.  It says, all right, wherever I fucking go, you go, but stay 10 feet behind me.  And then you could just fucking...  So I bet you as soon as you stop, that thing stops.  That would be cool as shit.  How do we get one of those?  Do you feel like you're being stalked all the time, though?  I feel like something's following me.  Can we get one for the day?  Oh, sure.  Where's that video?  They'd be willing to just give it to us.  Why not?  I like those... 
[01:32:00]  Like the Honda robots that you see at CES and stuff.  Yeah.  They look like they're really moving.  They jump and go downstairs.  All right.  Pretty cool looking.  Yeah.  The future.  There's a show on Bionic Man coming on Smithsonian.  And then another show on flying cars.  I love that Smithsonian channel.  We're never going to get flying cars, though.  No, no.  Too much responsibility for people, I think.  Maybe in like the year billion. 
[01:32:30]  The year one billion.  Why?  With GPS, maybe we could figure out some shit that you can't really...  Oh, man.  You got to stay within a certain height or something.  That'd be when cars are automatic.  Oh, is that the Bionic Man?  He looks silly.  He looks flat.  Yeah, why'd they make the head so lifelike?  And then the body just looks like robot parts.  Yeah, what the fuck?  He's got giant hips.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  He's got a birthing.  It does.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, no.  They gave the little cat Bionic legs. 
[01:33:00]  You should get Beavis Bionic Legs.  No!  He's got fine legs.  Get all rusted out in the pool.  Little Beavis.  That Smithsonian channel's great.  And then I don't have any trips planned for the future.  So I could watch those air crash shows.  Those are good.  But you got to put a moratorium on those when you're a month out from flying somewhere.  You can't watch those shows.  I'll watch them all the time.  Wow, check that out.  The fucking...  Something got sucked in the engine.  It blew up. 
[01:33:30]  It fucking spun in.  Fuck that.  And then it's like, oh, I'm flying somewhere.  Yeah, no.  I'll DVR that shit.  It just happened recently with a 777 head to reland in Chicago.  A bird strike.  Yeah, yeah.  Going to China.  China.  All right.  We got a little Sal bit here for everybody.  Sal?  Oh, good.  We also got Jocktober still.  Sal?  Yeah.  Coming up on a very special Opie and Anthony show, one staff member gets pushed too far. 
[01:34:00]  You said after 6, Travis.  You don't even have the text.  Where's the text then?  After 6 o'clock doesn't matter.  What does it mean it doesn't matter?  I knew I was going to get here before 6.  Usually Eric is here.  This is like, I can't even voice my own opinion here.  When he's asked to come into work on time.  I'm just saying that in the event that something is going on, someone's not going to be here  or whatever.  The other people step up around here and they help the other person out.  But it all turns into is, this guy's not here.  Fuck him.  That's all it fucking turns into around here.  After admitting to a premature erectile dysfunction. 
[01:34:30]  I just couldn't come with her.  Sal realizes that he can't have sex with a woman to completion or be punctual.  I told you six weeks ago that I was going to be here between 5, 30 and 6 for the rest  of the month.  Things turned south in a hurry.  When the sex bagel is brought into the equation.  But how am I supposed to anticipate Eric going to be here late?  So I'm not here.  So all of a sudden, everyone else's responsibilities fall under me.  You're here.  Also, Sal sounds kind of girly when he yells.  I told you earlier this month that I'm going to be here between 5, 30 and 6 every day. 
[01:35:00]  Find out what becomes of Sal.  You're the only other person here who could cover for if I'm not here or Eric is here.  And will his production ever improve?  Don't get the panda.  Angry!  All on the next very special Opie and Anthony show.  This is fucking ridiculous, dude. 
[01:35:30]  That's a good one.  I like that one.  Oh, is that a good one?  Sal did a good job with that.  Oh.  Sal wasn't involved in the production.  Oh.  Who put that together?  Sam and Troy Kwan.  Why don't we should get Troy in here?  Yeah, he's more of a production guy.  I don't feel the question ever.  Do we have a Sal update?  Has he been coming into work on time?  Yeah, he has.  All right.  Good for Sal.  All right, Sal.  Sal's a good guy. 
[01:36:00]  Sal's doing well.  I guess everybody on staff's doing well.  Yep.  Oh.  I think.  As far as I know.  We should welcome back Eric Nagel.  He's here.  From vacation.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  What?  The Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Continues. 
[01:36:30]  I thought he'd come back with a little Tommy Two-Tone.  Why?  What happened?  Uh-oh.  I just thought it was funny.  Work stoppage? 
[01:37:00]  Hi, Sam.  Hi.  Oh, boy.  What?  Yeah.  Why Tommy Two-Tone?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I wouldn't ask it in that.  What?  No idea.  Never heard this hit song?  No.  Tommy Two-Tone?  Yeah.  Do we have it?  Yeah.  I mean, I'll look it up, but I think.  Yeah, it's called Jenny, I think.  Jenny, Jenny.  Who did I do?  Yeah.  8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9.  That's the hook.  Yeah, it's a phone number song. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  They said anybody who had that phone number got, like, pranked, like.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That was actually her number, too.  The real Jenny.  Really?  It was, right?  Yeah.  And they actually dated briefly.  I looked that whole story up.  They dated briefly, and that was it.  Why would he put the phone number out publicly like that?  That was.  What's the area code?  That he never said.  How come we're not hearing it?  Can you play?  Yeah, it's a good song.  All right. 
[01:38:00]  Jenny.  Danny.  Yeah.  Johnny, I got your number.  Oh, remember that version?  Johnny, don't change your number.  He thought people.  It's easy.  That was one of those update shows on VH1, and they.  And he thought people still gave a shit.  Right.  So he did the acoustic version of it?  Yeah.  Oh, it's horrible.  It was bad, huh?  Could you, no, find the acoustic version.  That's the real version right there.  But then they, it was like, where are they now?  Whatever the fuck that VH1 series was. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  And it's so douchey.  Do they have the little interview about them, too?  Where are they now?  I got one from the WGN Morning News.  No, no, no.  It's a VH1 or an MTV thing.  You've got to find this, because the where are they now,  they really thought that it's just a matter of time  before you would come back with another big, huge fucking song.  I don't see that one.  Uh-huh.  But we do have the W.  Let's hear the acoustic version that he did with the news programmy. 
[01:39:00]  Right after the weather.  Stop.  Oh, God.  Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to?  Who's that?  That's not him.  Oh, yeah.  It's one of those love songs of the 80s.  But that's not him.  He's coming up, though.  Yeah, that's the intro.  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  Well, Jenny was a real person, and she gave me her phone number.  I think he's ever had to explain this story before.  Oh, God.  I wrote it on the bathroom wall.  He's dead now, isn't he? 
[01:39:30]  Tommy Two-Tone.  Is he?  Yeah.  That's nice.  We go for about five-year runs.  Tommy One Song.  Oh.  Tommy All Bones.  Oh.  Tommy Tombstone.  Tommy Tombstone.  Tommy fucking buried.  Tommy, I'll be right over here.  Good night, Chip.  Jump right in whenever you want, Chip.  Sure.  I'm right here.  Just bump me in. 
[01:40:00]  Play the dumb song.  Oh, yeah.  He's got it down.  He knows the song.  Think he wanted to play one of the new ones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jenna, Jenna.  Who can I turn to?  Turn to?  Damn.  He's got his dumb sunglasses on.  Give me something I could hold on.  He does a fucking mustard thing with this.  Yeah.  Where he's affected.  This is his.  It's not just a pop song.  There's a lot of skill involved in this.  His voice might not be as good as he used to be. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  Now he's got to go.  Here he goes.  He's going to have a tough time hitting this.  Uh-oh.  Someone's helping him.  I need to make you mine.  Jenna!  Uh-oh.  How many times did he sing this song? 
[01:41:00]  Right.  How many times do you think he sang this since he wrote it?  That's what he, the, the number.  The number.  This guy is famous worldwide for one lousy three minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  One lousy three minute song.  What do you think he is, Oswald?  When did he drop dead?  Did he really?  He's not dead.  No, I don't think he's dead.  I heard he was dead.  No.  Nope.  Wishful thinking.  Tommy Doubled Tones.  Tommy Two Tones is not even his name.  I would have sworn he was dead. 
[01:41:30]  No, he's alive.  What's his name, Travis?  Tommy Heath.  I can't hear you.  Oh, but you can't hear Travis.  Thank God.  No, he's spitting out some important information.  Oh, I'm sorry, Travis.  I feel bad.  I was supposed to stay in my head.  I'm sorry.  He's a computer analyst now.  Oh, he is?  Is he real?  I guess he gets frequent calls to appear on morning shows.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is he not singing anymore?  No.  He just works with computers.  He lives in Portland, Oregon.  He's a computer analyst.  Wait.  From Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine.  Yeah.  Best damn phone number giver outer. 
[01:42:00]  He never had another song.  No.  What was the next?  I love the.  Yeah.  The sideways version.  The next song.  It was probably Becky.  Oh.  She had a bad number.  Yeah.  Get Around Girl, which didn't chart.  Should we look it up?  Yeah.  Let's say Get Around Girl.  You sure that was his second best song ever?  That was a follow-up.  It's just like 635-2997.  It just doesn't.  It didn't have the same impact.  Yeah.  And he realized that Jim Croce already sang to the operator, so he couldn't do that. 
[01:42:30]  Got shown up.  The license plate says Two-Tone-2.  Okay.  I ask you this.  Did you kiss?  Uh-oh.  Kiss my best friend.  Uh-oh.  This dog.  Jesus.  I want to hear the chorus if it goes, Johnny, I got you. 
[01:43:00]  Here we go.  Come on.  Johnny, I got you.  No?  This is a terrible song.  I don't hate this.  You don't?  No.  Why not?  This is a very generic 80s song.  It's just.  Get around, get around, girl.  Ugh.  Get around, get around, girl.  Oh.  Get around, get around, girl. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  You don't like it?  Yeah.  Pretty bad.  She's a get around girl.  He never could.  This is who got around me.  He could never fucking re-grasp onto the success of Jenny Jenny.  Johnny Johnny.  Tommy Two-Tone's birthday?  What brought up?  Just a phone number song.  Hmm?  Yeah.  Are we going to do a bit like that?  Oh, what do you mean?  Oh, boy.  Now, everybody's very curious.  Iraq coming back from his vacation. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  How was Disney?  Is that his arm?  Yep.  Iraq, comment.  Fair question.  It's a world of laughter, a world of tears.  It's a world of hope and a world of fears.  There's so much that we share that it's time we're aware.  It's a big Iraq after all. 
[01:44:30]  Iraq, come on.  I don't want to make fun.  Let's have fun.  Big party for Iraq.  How is Disney?  I love it.  Yeah.  Happiest place on earth.  Travis loves it.  More than anything.  As an adult.  Yeah.  Just love going there.  Aw.  There it is.  I don't necessarily love it.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  It's not great.  It is great.  And it's great to go without kids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It just smells nice.  Smells like cinnamon and vanilla.  The whole place.  It's all one big Cinnabon stand. 
[01:45:00]  It really is.  But is it all rides?  Well, there's some rides.  There's traction.  Some of it is educational.  True.  Hall of Presidents.  What?  Oh, come on.  Exactly.  I'd be very bored there.  No, you wouldn't.  No, it's the greatest place in the world.  It's the happiest place on earth.  Best place in the world.  Did you ever ride the rock and roller coaster?  Yeah.  No, I don't go roller coasters.  Chip would love the rock and roller coaster.  Fuck yeah.  Throw my arms up in the air.  Like you didn't even care.  Like I don't give a fuck.  You hear what's going on in Yale? 
[01:45:30]  Ah.  Awkward.  This is Travis's favorite story today.  Yeah, this is absolutely my favorite story.  Eric.  She's not going to talk?  Oh, yeah, man.  We got a guy that's pooping in dryers.  What the fuck is that about?  That's his thing?  What kind of fucking animal?  Yale searches for, and they wrote this, not me.  Yale searches for poopitrator.  Poop the poopitrator.  Adding feces to dryers. 
[01:46:00]  The poopitrator.  Yale University hopes to solve a case of whodunit by identifying this stinker who has been soiling  students' laundry by sticking human feces inside clothes dryers.  So you put your clothes in the dryer.  See, I swear.  Go back up to your dorm room.  And shit is just fucking hot air and shit.  See, people obviously would be horrified to find this.  I swear to you, I would have to laugh.  Oh, I'd be mad though.  You'd be mad?  I would just laugh. 
[01:46:30]  My rock star shirt was in there or something?  Well, what are you going to do?  You know, the culprit has been dubbed the poopitrator and is being blamed for at least  four incidents in the past month.  Oh, my God.  In the laundry room at Saybrook College.  We did that to a rival dorm floor's microwave when I was at Syracuse.  A little shit in there?  Shit in a bag and put it in a microwave and turn it on and run downstairs.  No, we ran downstairs.  What ends up happening?  Wow, that must have smelled so fucking bad.  But what ends up happening is the people on that floor come down and trash our bathroom 
[01:47:00]  like you've never just shit smeared on the walls and doors pulled off hinges.  I love that.  It got really ugly.  They were mad?  Really mad.  They knew who did it, too.  Oh, yes, they did.  I'm one of the few that will tell you that college is a complete joke.  Yeah.  Parents spend their whole lives getting the money together for their kids to go to college.  For shit.  Then you fast forward and it's so they can smear shit.  They can smear shit.  Yeah.  On the bathroom of a floor that did them wrong. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  It's just nonsense at college.  You barely have time to study.  There's so much nonsense going on.  You've got to put all the shit in the laundry.  Right.  Especially when it's cold.  What's Saybrook College?  That's part of Yale University?  I don't get how that works.  I don't get so, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Saybrook Master says, Yale police are investigating.  He says students are being asked to not leave their laundry unattended and the targeted machines  have been cleaned.  Officials at the Ivy League school also are considering changes to laundry room access. 
[01:48:00]  The report says that the Saybrook students are angry about the mess and have begun standing  watch over the laundry room.  I've got to watch my clothes so no shit's in it.  But they're going to figure out.  Great prank.  They're going to have an idea who might have done this, and then they're going to have  to do some shit back to him.  Yeah, now the suspect, he's going to have to shit in dirty laundry and then put the  laundry in a dryer.  Nobody will know there's shit in the middle.  He's going to have to change his M.O. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  Yeah.  That's great.  Wow.  It's your Billy Madison thing.  Put his shit in the laundry.  What is Roland's Twitter?  Rolandos99.  R-O-L.  It's Roland.  You don't know his Twitter?  O-S-9-9.  Oh, 9-9.  I put 6-9.  Okay.  You should follow him.  He's great.  I check his stuff.  I just don't remember what it was.  Roland's a good follow.  He's great with that.  He's great with...  I guess not. 
[01:49:00]  He's great...  You've got to talk.  Just notice who's instigating.  Thank you.  That's all I asked today.  Oh, the people that didn't give out his phone number?  People who drove it home.  The people that didn't open a fucking highway and knew it.  Well, I'm happy Iraq's back.  Yeah.  I love Iraq.  I would have liked to have heard about his vacation.  Aside from, you know, the...  The obvious incident.  I mean, how was the rest of the vacation?  You were gone for a full week. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Good.  Nice.  I want to know about Simpsons World at Universal Studios.  Did you go?  He was supposed to go.  Did you go to Simpsons World?  Universal?  Comment, Iraq?  It looks amazing.  So...  Hmm.  Take any pictures?  Homer?  I don't see any of the Facebook photos because we're not friends anymore.  Oh, no.  Wait.  Iraq isn't friends with you?  No.  He defriended me for a reason.  Oh, that's right.  When?  I don't know.  A month ago?  Iraq, why'd you unfriend Travis? 
[01:50:00]  It's a fair question.  He's not commenting on anything.  He's got no comment today.  We got another great college story coming in from Todd in New Jersey.  Oh.  Todd.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, boy.  Todd in Kent State.  And we also know what Tommy Two Tones' follow-up hit was.  Oh.  Oh.  Something that actually charred in Top 40.  No way.  First, we got...  Who was this again?  Todd from New Jersey.  Todd.  Why does it say...  All right.  Your name changed to P.  For whatever reason. 
[01:50:30]  Go ahead, Todd.  At my college, we used to do this thing called Midnight Screams, like during finals.  Everyone bends and whatever.  And my buddies turned it into a big party.  Well, they eventually turned it into this huge party.  And instead of doing water balloons, they used to kind of blow the balloons up with their  mouth first in the air.  And then they'd piss in it.  And then they'd throw it in the trees and break over the crowd.  See?  This is...  Piss grenades.  So, to the parents out there, don't stress too much about your kid's college education. 
[01:51:00]  Jesus.  I'm here to say it's just nonsense.  That's terrible.  And you got a cool phone now with Google, so you really don't need to go to college anymore.  I can't imagine there being an age where that just stops being funny.  Right.  Of course.  Especially when they have, like, dorms with unisex floors.  Because it was just dudes on our floors.  So, we would just get bored and there was no girls to act like human beings around.  Right.  So, you could just end up shitting in bags and putting people in the microwave. 
[01:51:30]  Just shitting.  Throwing your own feces.  Fuck you.  Nice.  Jacking off in the hall.  Holding it.  Throwing cum.  Squeezing it between your fucking toes.  Chopping up and down in it.  All right.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill.  Yeah, I figured I'd chip in.  And I want to know if there's a $5,000 perpetrator fugitive.  Oh. 
[01:52:00]  I liked what you really wanted.  I liked what you really wanted to talk about.  But I guess you decided.  What did you want to talk about?  Call an audible.  Can't punch out.  He's suggesting a podcast on poop.  What?  And I'm thinking, I'm wondering if we have enough poop stories.  Are you kidding me?  Of course we do.  Are you willing to believe that we do?  Yeah.  So far, all of our podcasts could have been pure shit stories.  Oh, can we do Green Pie Jones?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's dedicate this week's podcast to poop.  You think he'd do some production for it? 
[01:52:30]  I know.  He definitely would not.  Oh, boy.  What's the quick list?  We all have a good poop story.  Okay.  Mine's with the little nugget that fell out of my boxers and hit my big toe and rolled across his stoop.  Well, here's the thing.  Oh, that's so funny.  You could do.  Sick.  Because we have enough to do one on poop stories and one on poop pranks.  Oh.  Because we could do, like, the two Green Pie Jones things, the baby diaper mustache, Pat Duffy brushing his teeth. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, the shitting on the beach.  But that's stories.  So it's like, do you want.  I say we do stories first and then we do.  Fecal play?  Fecal play down the road if this podcast does well.  I bet it will.  Let's start with poop stories.  Okay, so you got pooping on the beach.  Yep.  You got poop coming down your leg.  No, no.  Just one nugget that hit my big toe.  Just a little nugget.  Actually, the side of my sandal, to be completely accurate, and then it propelled it across the stoop in front of everybody.  Jimmy's got a really good poop story. 
[01:53:30]  When I was walking on Newton Street past Bill D'Angelo's house, and I shit my fucking pants on the way to school,  and I fucking rolled out my leg, and I kicked it out, and I showed Bill.  You showed Bill.  And I showed Bill.  I was sixth grade.  Does Ann have one?  I'm trying to remember if you ever told one.  Yeah, on the tip of his dick.  I left here with a fucking percolating belly once and had to stop at the Italian place.  Oh, right, okay.  Pay the mafia guy off.  He flooded the toilet.  And I fucked up for the bathroom.  These are the short versions of the story. 
[01:54:00]  What about when didn't Eric shit on the side of a highway?  We'll never know.  Oh, yes.  Who knows?  You're not comment.  Expressway.  Shit.  Comment.  Door.  Ajar.  Parked.  Diagonal.  Doody.  I think Florentine was in, and he told a story.  Throw him on there.  Kenny has one, too.  Kenny.  So did Kenny about when he was with Dice, and he had to fucking shit on the side of the  road?  Because Kenny shits like a fucking, Kenny shits like a goose with colon cancer.  And then, of course, we already done, uh, Don, we already did the George Brett as an O&A 
[01:54:30]  nugget?  Uh, probably, I would think so.  Try to find an O&A nugget that, uh, will follow this week's theme, poop stories on this  week's podcast, which will be out Wednesday.  But we already have, I mean, even without Kenny and Florentine.  And I'm sure we'll remember other ones after the show, right?  Pooping on the beach, nugget down the shorts.  Jim shits his pants and shows Bill D'Angelo, and Ant pays to flood out a toilet.  God, how'd they get him bouncing around and stuff?  That is pretty good.  We're looking at some gravity shit on TV. 
[01:55:00]  Pretty amazing.  Corabit.  Oh, it's a shame.  I'm never gonna hear the stories.  Hmm?  Maybe someday.  Oh, that's good.  Shit fucking podcast.  I'm psyched.  I'll download that one.  Um, we're almost ready for, uh, Jacktober.  Jacktober.  I got a, I got a, I got a quick religious thing.  Oh.  My, uh.  Have you found Jesus?  I don't know.  I'm having a tough time with the Jesus. 
[01:55:30]  My daughter was, uh, you know, baptized.  Sure.  Now that she's pretty much walking.  Aren't she supposed to do that when they're, like, really new?  I think so.  We decided to get a, uh, a private baptism at the church near me.  There were literally 12 people there.  Oh, nice.  In the entire church.  And three homeless people completely passed out sleeping at the back of the church.  Oh.  It ruled.  But I don't understand, like, the priest pulls out the, the baptism pamphlet and reads all 
[01:56:00]  sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Does the water.  And now what?  My, my child has, has Jesus in her?  Doesn't have that original sin, right?  But I don't understand.  You're born with all that sin all over you.  Yeah.  But why, why him reading from a pamphlet in a church now it's all good?  Like, it doesn't make sense.  That's the magic of, uh, religion.  It's magical.  And then I brought it up, unfortunately, in my apartment.  And then I got it talking to, you know, that he's the middleman.  I just want to have an open discussion about it. 
[01:56:30]  But there are people that have that blind faith where they don't even want to discuss it.  I just want to say, all I want to bring up in my house was, does anyone else find it weird  that he took a, a pamphlet, it was a pamphlet that said baptism on it or christening, whatever  the fuck.  You know, they just pull it off the wall and they read it.  He doesn't even know it by heart?  I think old school priests, they had to learn that shit, right?  But it made it look like they knew.  At least they had the fucking book low and they would glance down.  Well, I mean, cause we went for the private thing cause they want, you know, they want  people signing up for, for this religion left and right. 
[01:57:00]  They'll do the private ones for nothing.  By the way, we all got to go right next to the priest instead of having to sit in the  church.  Did you want her baptized or you didn't carry the way?  It's more for other people in my family.  That's fine.  Cause I, I don't know.  I, you know.  Magic mumbo jumbo.  I don't, I don't know.  I don't, I don't, I don't know.  You know what the odds are that you can't pick the right religion.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan of organized religion, but if it helps people, whatever, I don't know.  Is your wife religious?  No, no, no, not as much. 
[01:57:30]  No, no.  It's always the older people, you know, the older generations, but to read from a pamphlet  and then to say, okay, now, you know, the kid's got Jesus to me is mind blowing.  I'm like, really?  So I just want to have a discussion about that.  Like, wow.  Anyone else find this a little weird that it's a pamphlet?  You pour some water on the head and that's it.  Now there's magic in there.  That's all it takes.  Now there's religious magic in her.  And before that, what, Christ didn't care about the kid?  Christ was like, fuck the kid.  I just, until the water's poured, I'm not interested.  No, but it had some of that sin in there. 
[01:58:00]  But I just wanted to.  Would have ended up in limbo or something.  I brought it up just to maybe get a few jokes out.  Sure.  In general, just anyone who wants to jump in and just have a discussion how that is a little  strange, don't you think?  I'm not saying that you shouldn't believe, but you do find it weird that he's just reading  a pamphlet and he wants this over with fast.  And a few times he's just like, okay, like he was, you know, doing that type of thing.  He's just got to read from the fucking thing like you would from any other book or the Necromonicon 
[01:58:30]  or any of that stuff.  I was told he's the middleman.  Yeah.  That's supposed to need a middleman to the creator, though.  I don't think.  It's like you don't need a middleman to talk to God.  I think Jimmy's right.  What ruined it was that we weren't sitting in the actual church.  We saw him kind of reading through it with the pamphlet because like when we were growing  up, a good priest knew how to look down like if he lost his place and make it look like 
[01:59:00]  he's just deep in thought.  But he actually was like trying to figure out what he was supposed to say next.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But our priest, when we were growing up, absolutely knew that shit way more.  It seems than than this particular fellow.  That's all.  And then it was strange.  It was over.  And because it's we had the church to ourselves, we got to see him now a mere five minutes later  in combat pants.  What was he wearing?  Like fucking camo underneath this row.  Yeah.  That blew me away.  I'm like, I don't I don't think we're supposed to see that shit.  Was he a chaplain in the big war or something? 
[01:59:30]  I don't know what he was.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe that's why.  Maybe.  Maybe he's a chaplain in the National Guard or something.  But you don't want to see that either.  You want that weird mystery that the priests are always just kind of there.  It is weird when you're seeing regular clothes and fucking, you know, with a girl.  Let me say hi to Todd.  Yes.  Hey, Todd.  I was dating for a couple of years and she decided that she wanted to be a Lutheran minister.  And the whole issue of baptism was sort of making me think as I'd gone to church as a kid. 
[02:00:00]  And then as we got more serious and she started to go on the Lutheran minister kick, I started  asking about baptism and exactly what it means.  And is it a magical thing or is it symbolic of, you know, John the Baptist and all that  stuff?  And, you know, what if I start getting technical where it's like, okay, can it be done in  a hot tub?  Can it be done in a bathtub?  And, you know, what exactly constitutes a baptism?  And I started getting really specific with her and she couldn't answer the questions. 
[02:00:30]  I'm like, well.  Baptisms were done in rivers and stuff.  Yeah.  I don't think the water supply matters.  I think it's, you know, a person of God that has to do the whole shindig.  And we got lazy along the way and decided that we don't have to be in the rivers anymore.  It's a fucking sink.  A little sink.  A little sink.  Yeah.  And then I asked her, like, what's it mean to be a person of God just because you went  to a college and they gave you a diploma and now you're holy all of a sudden?  Yeah.  What if he cheated through his teaching?  Oh, man.  So is he a fake priest technically in God's eyes? 
[02:01:00]  But, you know, God's not really has decided like others that he's not talking to us right  now.  You know what I mean?  And so maybe eventually God will say, point out all the fake priests that cheated their  way through the whole thing.  Yeah.  My name's Fred.  I'm just a man like you.  Exactly.  And if you got baptized by one of these fake priests and you die and, you know, you're  standing in front of the supposed curly gates and he's like, oh, I'm sorry to tell you  that your guy wasn't real.  Like, oh, shit.  Yeah.  I picked the wrong one, huh?  The Jews are getting in.  I'm not a fan.  I'm not a fan of the blind faith people. 
[02:01:30]  I'm a fan of people that will at least openly discuss and maybe give their opinion on what they  thought the priest and the pamphlet was all about.  The priest and the pamphlet.  But I was shut down.  Like, you know, he's the middleman.  I'm like, OK, well, let's talk about that then.  What does that mean?  Right.  Yeah.  He's just like the conduit to God.  Because when you're sitting in the moment, you're like, OK, wait.  So now magic just entered my daughter, I guess.  Oh, that's not the basketball player.  Oh, Jesus.  But they don't want you to ask those questions because then you realize you don't know them 
[02:02:00]  after all.  Right.  Well, someone just tweeted.  They said that the only point was to compel you to raise the kid Catholic has no religious  value.  Is that true?  I don't even know that.  I don't even know if that's the truth.  It's like every other religion.  It's just that faith-based thing that, like, you can't sell people on it.  Yeah, it's the middleman guy, and he's the messenger between you and God.  And you have to go through all these customs to get these things done.  But there's nothing you could say that'll prove it or anything. 
[02:02:30]  So, you know, and someone goes.  Catholics, as far as I understand, you know, without being baptized and all that stuff,  you do not go to heaven.  So you need them in order to get to heaven.  That's what they're holding over to heaven.  That's so simple.  Like, all of a sudden, if you have a shitty family that doesn't baptize you, you don't  go to heaven?  Like, how does God fucking sleep with himself at night?  If God does that, if God goes, well, I'd love to let you in, kid, but your family didn't  take you.  I think he sleeps well if he could deal with, you know, World War II, things like that.  That's a good point.  It's a very small little thing.  Yeah.  If you, you know.  All right, boys. 
[02:03:00]  Bunch it out.  Fucking phones are lit.  And someone's asking if I tipped the priest.  Well, yes, I did.  Oh.  And you took it?  Well, that's the interesting point here.  We handed over a couple hundred saying thank you.  And he goes, oh, no, I can't take that.  But there's an envelope on the altar.  It's for the church.  It's for the church.  So just put it in the envelope.  And I'm thinking to myself, there's no way he's not taking a taste.  He can't vow a poverty or something.  I don't know.  What do they do? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, that's a nun.  We leave in the envelopes there with $200 cash.  You don't think he's taking a little taste and going, here, here's these cheap fuckers  gave us $20.  Does he seem, does he seem.  He was great.  I mean, I can't, I can't deny he was great.  It was nice and all that.  But I mean, was he dressed nice?  Does he need money?  But these are the questions.  Like, you know, I would like to discuss that with people around me.  You think he took a little taste after we left?  I don't think so.  A little taste.  I don't think so.  I don't think he took the taste. 
[02:04:00]  No, that's like stealing from the port box.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The new pope said the church should go back to poverty.  I like this new pope a lot.  He seems like a genuinely good guy.  Yeah.  But he's talking about poverty and how the church is vain and worldliness and they've  gotten caught up in worldliness.  Like, he's really fucking smashing the church a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Arrogant, pompous garbage that they do.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, they, they are, they have taken like kind of a fucking old gold ensconced and  fucking, you know, the, the, the Vatican is just this gaudy fucking rich. 
[02:04:30]  He won't, he won't stay in the pope's quarters.  He sleeps in a poverty stricken kind of quarters and he doesn't like to be, uh, no room service.  But they want everyone else to have a vow of poverty and then the Vatican is like over  the top impressive.  All these guys walking around.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Let's do a speed round here.  Go ahead, Travis.  Make it quick.  All right.  Thank you.  That was quick enough.  Walter in Florida.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  You know, the whole, the whole thing is just, um, it's just, Anthony nailed it in the head, 
[02:05:00]  I think, a minute ago.  You're in your head.  It's just, it's just faith, Opie.  You know, the guy has the ritual, the ritual kind of sort of turns on the green light and  it's kind of like you got married, you know, different now than you were 10 minutes before  you married.  There you go.  It's, it's that thing that you say, okay, now in the eyes of the Lord, you know, I give 
[02:05:30]  him my kid to just kind of watch over it a little bit.  We'll do our best.  He'll do our best.  And we have faith that it's going to come out.  Okay.  So it's more like all it is.  So it's more like symbolism, what went on the other day.  That's the word I'm looking for right there.  Yeah.  It's just something that you, you just kind of say to God, hey, listen, you know, we trust  you pretty good.  Do the best you can for our little kid.  We like it really good.  But when we're gone, you take over kind of a thing and, and we'll do the best we can. 
[02:06:00]  And we know.  Jimmy doesn't like religion, religious talk, but it's fascinating to me.  It really is fascinating.  I kind of like what he's saying.  At least it's symbolism instead of like, there's some kind of magic spark that just happened  because this priest put water on my daughter's head.  I kind of, I can appreciate what this guy's saying.  It's a, it's a better explanation.  That's it boys.  That's really all it is.  And you're actually just saying this to God, like the same creature being that created 
[02:06:30]  pulsars and black holes and light speed and the fucking, and particles, uh, and red shift  in the light, all of this.  And now he's like, well, I'd like to see some symbol.  It's just utter nonsense.  But he didn't create any of that stuff.  That's just science.  Dude, I, I, if everything came from nothing, how did science come about?  I know.  Listen, Jimmy, listen, Jimmy, it's the same God that blessed you with the skills that you 
[02:07:00]  have and the gift that you have.  Did I appreciate that?  I love the gift between his legs.  And I, did I appreciate that and what you're saying, but the gift I have.  We all agree.  We wish we had just a slightly more gift.  A little more gift.  Just a little bit.  We needed a little more wrapping paper.  Like gift.  Right.  But God didn't give me a sense of humor.  It was one of those things that's all fucking chemical out of need.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Dude.  Yes.  Stop it or you'll fuck the whole thing up. 
[02:07:30]  Dude.  Well, then I guess then, then God is not that terrific.  If, if I can just talk a little shit and have my, a gift is supposed to be free.  So if he gave me a gift and I misuse it, well, he won't take it back.  You didn't pay for the skill you have.  That's what I said.  You knew about it and you worked on it, but you know, it's just like a, like a doctor works  on what he works.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the same.  Yeah.  No, but it didn't cost you nothing to get it.  You had it.  Somebody put it in there.  No, nature did. 
[02:08:00]  It's, it's all chemicals.  Okay, boss.  So who owns nature, my friend?  Dude, nobody owns nature.  It's just.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Seriously.  I'm not even, I'm not shit on you for believing, but nobody owns.  There's not a magic man watching out over nature.  I've never, I've never used the word magic.  Or whatever you want to call it.  A deity.  A deity.  A deity.  Exactly.  Oh, the devil.  The magic bad guy.  And then there's the bad one who pays attention and tries to get us to, to not take God's  name in vain. 
[02:08:30]  The red, come on, dude.  You're a grown up.  Pretty good.  He's got, yeah, he's got horns and pitchfork.  He lives where it's hot.  He lives where it's hot.  He lives where it's hot.  Under the earth.  I almost.  God lives in heaven on the clouds.  It's just silly.  Yeah.  And I don't want to die any more than you do.  I don't want to cease to exist any more than you do.  I love the idea of being and existing.  I love it.  And I know that the idea of God gives us that, that we're going to continue to exist.  And it makes it hard for me to not want to, to not want to believe in a God because I 
[02:09:00]  want to exist after I die.  And the prospect of not existing bums me out.  That's all God is.  And I hate to say that.  No, but that's, you know, but remember too, you know, the higher power.  We call it God.  You, you call it higher power, but there's always some, some force.  Yes.  That's in control of it all.  And it's mightier.  Allah.  Allah.  Wugbar.  Allah.  Wugbar.  Allah.  Wugbar.  No, dude, it doesn't have to be, I know what you mean about higher power and it's kind 
[02:09:30]  of hard to, for me, I struggle with the higher power idea.  Like what is it and what is it for me?  But sometimes it can just be a group of people doing something that you are not doing as a power  greater than yourself.  It doesn't have to be a spiritual deity.  I gotcha.  I gotcha.  All right.  And we can, we can go around and around.  But Opie, I think that's it.  I think, and by the way, you really don't know if he took a taste because you left and  left the envelope.  So that one is just, oh, well, hopefully he didn't.  You should have put dye on the money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He comes out with fucking red diamonds. 
[02:10:00]  Probably not though.  Yeah.  Probably not.  You just made me think of something.  Thank God I was born into the Catholic religion.  Can you imagine being born into, you know, well, I'm just going to say another type of  religion.  Yeah.  I want to keep it slightly vague even though we all know what I'm talking about here.  And then, uh, you are the chosen one to strap on all those fucking bombs.  Oh God.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  You got to be the fucking bomb guy.  They decided, they decided you got to be the bomb guy. 
[02:10:30]  Blah.  Blah.  Well, there's other religious groups that do that.  I just want to say.  Jimmy, what do you feel about this?  Let's say that, uh, cause there's always this separation of, uh, the church and, and  God and science.  They're always at loggerheads as they say.  Uh, what if it's the same thing?  What if this higher power is just some type of energy source that did create everything?  And it was very scientific.  It was basic chemical reactions and stuff.  And us as a life form from all that matter. 
[02:11:00]  And we do have electronic impulses that give us pretty independent personalities and whatnot.  Uh, you would, might call that a spirit.  And we all, once we do pass on, uh, from this mortal coil, end up in some energy collective,  uh, that is the equivalent to a heaven or whatnot.  But it's very scientific and it's been twisted around through people not understanding in the  past.  A lot of people misinterpreted and misunderstood everything from the planets to our own earth 
[02:11:30]  and everything to what the sun is.  Right, right.  So it's this very scientific thing that's been interpreted to be a religious thing, but  it is this mass collective of energy that we are part of.  I could live with that and I, it wouldn't, I don't deny that that exists.  That's very possible.  And, uh, I just, it's just the ritual of what religion has become is so embarrassing.  It's embarrassing for a guy to be walking around and people to go, your holiness, he's a guy. 
[02:12:00]  And I'm not saying he's not a good man, but I'm watching, I'm walking by the beacon and  the Dalai Lama is coming for three nights and the end is his holiness, the Dalai Lama.  Really?  Yes.  Like literally we are all spawned from a load.  You understand?  That's all of us, whether we are a Pope or whether this guy jamming his middle finger,  every one of us tumbled out of a dick.  Oh man.  It makes me nuts.  That bums me out.  Yeah, but that's all we are.  But maybe it is still kind of an electron thing. 
[02:12:30]  Sure, maybe.  I'm not denying that.  Yeah.  Or maybe humans figured it all out.  Mm-hmm.  Living somewhere else.  Oh, aliens?  No, just some kind of human form that has, you know, been around way longer than us.  On some other planet though?  Yeah, they figured it out.  Mm-hmm.  There might be a little chip in all of our brains that goes off when we die and go,  oh, okay, now.  Go back to a...  Now we get to go do the rest of this shit now. 
[02:13:00]  It sounds like Scientology.  Yeah.  Going to the fucking other planet and the thetans and the fucking...  It's not far-fetched to think that humans are going to figure out how to, I don't know,  live forever or almost live forever or certainly for a hell of a lot longer than we get to live.  I don't know.  Meat rots.  That's pretty much the bottom line with people.  Meat will rot.  So, I don't know.  Morty!  Morty!  Mike of Long Island. 
[02:13:30]  I've been living in a fool's paradise.  Mikey, what's up?  Mike?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hey, it turns out anybody can actually baptize a baby.  Found this out.  My brother was in the hospital.  He was very young.  And he was about to die.  Thank God he made it.  But the nurse asked my mom if he was baptized.  And she said, no.  And she said, do you want me to baptize your child?  And she was like, what?  She's like, yeah, anybody can baptize a child, especially at the time of need.  So, this whole priest thing, not really necessary. 
[02:14:00]  You know, you can grab one of your buddies and have him baptize.  I need an old priest and a young priest.  But do you have to do some mumbo-jumbo thing?  You have to know the mumbo, the proper mumbo-jumbo.  No, you just kind of say, you know, we bless this child in the name of God, pour a little  water, and you're good.  You know, it's basically like an emergency baptism.  So, I could, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to go with your concept.  So, I could grab kids off the street and decide to make them Catholics?  Sure.  Can you imagine?  Oh, man. 
[02:14:30]  That would piss off some people.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Anybody that's Catholic that's been through confirmation, that's, you know, done through  the whole damning, hold the steps, can actually baptize a child.  So, if you had a Catholic friend or something like that, you could absolutely get someone  to baptize your kid because, you know, anybody in the name of God can do it.  So, following that logic, you got a kid that's not part of the Catholic faith because their  parents believe in something else.  But you decide, as a Catholic, I need to baptize that kid.  So, you grab him off the street and do the mumbo-jumbo.  So, now he's officially a Catholic for eternity? 
[02:15:00]  No, no.  He has to be chosen to be a Catholic by the parents.  See, here's the thing, dude.  Well, that's...  Okay.  You know how we look at Greek mythology and we read about it in school?  Them Greek homos?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or we look back at 2,000 years ago or the cave wall and we laugh at how fucking primitive  they were.  Yeah.  Or when they thought that the earth was the center of the universe, that the sun was holy,  or that the aurora...  What are they called?  The...  The...  The lights...  Aurora Borealis.  Or that they were God crying or the gods. 
[02:15:30]  You know how we look at that as horse shit?  That's how we're going to look back at all this.  And it's only...  What bothers me about it is we think we're such an advanced, brilliant species and culture  and we still have these fucking primitive ape behaviors.  I could totally spin that around on you, though, Jimmy.  Sure.  How about you mocking the fact that this God that would create all kinds of complex things  in this universe would also look in and say somebody, you know, has to pay attention to  some dumb rule or something. 
[02:16:00]  And that seems very silly.  But you're thinking about it on a level of yourself or some other human-like intellect  that you can't concentrate on that or that is so big that you couldn't concentrate on the  smaller aspect of humanity.  But this God, this all-knowing God, is able to do those things, to put up huge fucking  stars in the sky and, you know, make sure some kid gets baptized all at once. 
[02:16:30]  And thinking any differently is kind of an archaic thought process because you're thinking  in a very limited way.  Well, I'm only thinking in the ability I have to, as a human being, and to make decisions.  So the same mind that is going to determine whether or not I quote-unquote sin or not,  whether I quote-unquote accept God or not, is the same one that's coming to this conclusion.  And I will say this.  If there is that God that can do all that and still worries about whether or not I took 
[02:17:00]  the Lord's name in vain, that he's an ass.  Yes.  I got to agree with you on that one.  Maybe our brains are just not there yet.  We just don't, you know, no one could say for sure they know.  That always bothers me because we don't know for sure, right?  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  People have ideas and stuff, but you don't know.  I won't say who this is, but my mother secretly baptized my uncle's daughters.  Say, that's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Secretly baptized.  So, like, I guess her...  I wouldn't be surprised if my daughter was already baptized, if you know what I'm saying.  Right, right.  I wouldn't be surprised because we took a little too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's a real thing that happens.  Wow.  So maybe this was just all a show thing this past weekend.  Mm-hmm.  None of us like the idea of ceasing to exist.  I don't like it either.  Mm-hmm.  I want to exist.  Sure.  And that's all this is.  It's all it is.  It's a way we can see that we're going to exist after. 
[02:18:00]  It gives you motivation to do anything because without...  If you just look at this like this is it, you really don't have much motivation to do much of anything except whatever is pleasurable to you.  Hey, you know, we just got a short time here.  Why the fuck would I waste it working or procreating or doing any of this stuff that, you know.  Yeah.  Believe me, I don't want to be...  I think as human beings we haven't figured out shit yet. 
[02:18:30]  But, you know, I have a major problem with organizer legend, absolutely.  But the more we figure out, the more preposterous...  Like, not preposterous like I can't wrap my head around it, but just idiotic.  We also learn about the possibilities, which are pretty fucking cool.  I think the, like Jimmy said, the whole mumbo-jumbo thing and your holiness and the hierarchy of clergy and stuff is really fucking ridiculous.  Nonsense.  I don't get it.  I don't believe in it. 
[02:19:00]  And if there is some religious aspect to this life here, I think it is based more in science than anything else.  And it's been interpreted over the years to be some type of God and we're his servants kind of a fucking thing.  I don't know.  Did God invent science, though?  Science!  Trevor in Canada.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I think one of the biggest problems with religion nowadays is that everybody's looking for a black and white answer.  And I don't think there is such a thing. 
[02:19:30]  I really think...  Half that.  The people who have blind faith who don't want to talk about it is because they don't know what faith is.  See the album cover of that with the naked kid?  It's crazy.  Sure I did.  Well, some people just go to church and think because they just step in a church, they have faith.  That's exactly right.  And you know what?  Faith is really between you and who you believe in.  And that's why, you know, for someone like Jimmy or whatever, even myself, I mean, I was brought up as a Catholic and it turned me away from the church because I was told if you don't believe this, you're not accepted and all that kind of bullshit. 
[02:20:00]  And it's like, you know, my God accepts everybody, whether you're, you know, saying his name in vain, whether you're gay or not.  I mean, there's so many things in the Bible that are not talked about.  The only ones that are talked about and exploited are by these organized religions that kind of want you to believe in something that they believe.  And, you know, it's unfortunate, but I can see why it's there.  Some people need that structure.  Some people have a hard time believing.  But, dude, when you think about it, this is what, like, again, I'm not saying you're stumping in front of religion, but Christians, like, if a guy walks around right now saying he's the Messiah, we look at him like, you asshole. 
[02:20:30]  That's true.  And 2,000 years, hold on, dude, 2,000 years ago, there were organized societies.  It wasn't like we were cave people.  There's a guy walking around, and I think Jesus existed, and I think he was probably a really good person and probably a very, you know, a sincere person.  But now all of a sudden, an entire society follows him like he was the son.  It's just mind-boggling to me that this is accepted. 
[02:21:00]  Well, you know what?  And I agree with you, and that's why it's hard for some people to believe that.  I mean, I think in the Bible there are a lot of stories, and they talk about Jesus told a lot of stories as symbolisms they didn't all necessarily have.  Stories?  But the exact same thing is exactly what you're talking about there, Jimmy, is just, you know, everybody back then thought this guy was crazy.  He's a lunatic, and it wasn't until after he died that some things happened that made them second-guess things.  And didn't they write the Bible like 600 years later or something? 
[02:21:30]  Well, yeah.  300, I think.  Was it 300, 300 years later, and then there's a whole bunch of stories they chose not to put in the Bible?  300 years in that day was pretty fucking, I don't think they had an accurate depiction of what was going on.  They had no real records of anything.  They only lived to 30.  So it's like 10 generations, and they decided to write about this Jesus guy, right?  And this one begat that one, and that one begat this one, and begat, begat, begat.  And then there's a whole bunch of stories they left out.  I would like to know what those stories are and if that changes your perspective on things. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  So someone decided.  Who edited the Bible?  I should know all this shit, but someone decided.  I think a canon they were called.  Yeah, they did publishing.  Yeah, they decided which stories would be in the Bible.  Yeah.  Who are they to decide?  You'll also hear people saying, you know, why does God let this happen, or why didn't God help?  And you know what?  Those are, again, along the lines of people saying, ask God for this, ask God for that,  where I truly believe he's given us everything that we needed.  The last time he interfered with the planet was when he decided to destroy it. 
[02:22:30]  But maybe life is really important to us, but in the overall scheme of things, it really isn't important.  Well, he left the planet for us to live and grow.  I mean, look at it now, right?  Like, look where we are.  Like, 10 years ago, we said money's not going to be existing anymore.  Now I can go to Starbucks and buy a fucking coffee with my phone.  Yeah, but when you look at something like the flood, or the biblical flood, does that not just seem like a childish story to you? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, of course.  No one lived to be 900, did he?  And he built a big boat.  I think there's probably a lot more violent than what the story's made out to be.  I totally believe there's a lot more violence involved that just, you know, to make it easier for kids to accept.  But, I mean, I truly believe dinosaurs were part of that story, and they were part of that destruction.  Oh, boy.  And because of the Bible, it doesn't say triceratops.  I mean, humans came up with the names of all these guys, but I really think they were one of those animals that were killed.  I'll tell you, dude, the problem with dinosaurs is that for years and years, religion did not ‚Äì they said dinosaurs were a hoax and that they didn't exist. 
[02:23:30]  And they began to look so foolish and embarrassingly out of touch that they tried to backtrack and update and go, oh, no, no, no, no, the dinosaurs were there.  Like, how does that not make anybody who believes in that just go, oh, God, what crap?  Well, that's ‚Äì and see, that's what I mean by the part of organized religion where you can't tell somebody to believe. 
[02:24:00]  It's up to that person to have that feeling.  And how many ‚Äì how many religions are we up to?  Oh.  Someone on Twitter said 4,200 about.  I don't know.  Is that the number they throw around?  So that means ‚Äì that means only one is going to be right.  He wrongs a dinosaur, my, gee, my.  Yeah.  Some of them cross over, too.  I think probably one of the biggest things, Opie, if you ever want to get into a debate or a great discussion with somebody who says they're highly religious, is ask them what faith means and try to watch them stumble through that because ‚Äì 
[02:24:30]  No, I'm not about ‚Äì I just want to have open discussions.  I don't want to question someone's faith because if it gets you through a good ‚Äì a bad situation or whatever, who am I to say?  I'm not going to be that guy.  I just want to have open discussions and find the weird little things about it, like the pamphlet.  Yeah.  I have a dinosaur in my backyard.  And someone's saying that the stories were 90 years after Jesus died. 
[02:25:00]  What's the ‚Äì  I heard 600.  I heard 300.  Jimmy heard 300.  How could you tell?  They didn't even have a calendar back then.  Even 90.  I don't know what the hell they were doing.  You got to count for leap years.  90 years ago.  I don't even know what, like, my great-grandfather did for a living.  90 years, yeah.  Let's move on to some other callers.  I want you to do that.  Hope to see you again in Toronto there, Jim, and bring these two guys with you.  Thank you, buddy.  Dinosaurs.  And also, dude, the problem is that there were so many stories edited out of the Bible.  Yeah.  And that's what drives you crazy. 
[02:25:30]  It's like ‚Äì it was voted of the most popular story.  It's just ‚Äì  Right.  What are those stories saying?  So people reference the Bible as a great book and a good moral code to follow in a lot.  Okay.  But the fact that they're so married to it, what Leviticus said about homosexual ‚Äì like,  the fact that there's so many dumb motherfuckers involved with it, it's just hard to respect it.  The one thing I have no doubt in my mind is the fact that this earth is way more than 2,000 years old.  That I have no doubt in my fucking mind.  They say 6,000, I think, is what the Bible says. 
[02:26:00]  Of course.  Just look at basic ‚Äì look at that picture there.  The basic erosion of, like, the Grand Canyon you look at.  No, it's wrong.  Yeah.  The dinosaurs were on the boat.  Yeah, it's wrong.  Yeah, it's just wrong.  No doubt it's over 6,000 years old.  Yeah, it's wrong.  You could look at mountains and valleys and the erosion and rivers and stuff and know that it took a lot longer than 6,000 years to carve that out.  There's no doubt in my mind at least that much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At least that much.  Well, no, God had a 24-hour ‚Äì because that's how God based his day. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  On the earth's rotation.  Not anything else to do.  And it builds a universe.  There's 100 billion galaxies.  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  24 hours for this blob of blue shit.  It just makes you throw your hands up in the air.  I saw Gravity, though.  It's a terrific fucking blob of shit.  It's beautiful.  It is.  It looks like a nice blue marble.  But God wouldn't.  Why would he use that as his little pocket watch?  Right?  Exactly.  I mean, he's got tired after six days.  He needed a rest.  I got to take a load off. 
[02:27:00]  How do you rest?  Sunday.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I never got that.  It's like when Superman fucking tries to open a locked door and he grabs the doorknob and goes ‚Äì and it fucking walks in.  It's like if he could pick up a bus, he wouldn't have to strain at the doorknob.  Well, then there would be a boring show, though.  Yeah, but he just fucking ‚Äì she'd be nothing.  You got to blow that shit off so you can enjoy yourself a little bit.  You understand.  So God's making all kinds of things and then he fucking gets tired?  Wouldn't he make potholes wherever he walks if he's that powerful?  Yeah, you'd think so. 
[02:27:30]  Or maybe he just knows how to keep the touchdown.  And could God make a boulder so big that he himself could not lift it?  Whoa.  It's fucking crazy, right?  Yep.  He should be able to because he's God.  He could do anything.  But then if he could do anything, he should be able to lift the rock.  See, look at all these questions in the discussion.  That's all I was looking for.  A little of that over the weekend.  Just a little.  Yeah.  Like the pamphlet thing bothered me.  So I was ‚Äì oh, no, man.  He's the magic ‚Äì he's the middleman and that was it.  The magic guy.  He's the magician's assistant. 
[02:28:00]  The hot chick that comes out and fucking ‚Äì  Well, he wasn't a hot chick.  Waves of points at the fucking mysterious box that, yeah, people get caught in half in.  All right.  We're going to do some Jocktober, I think, next.  I have important announcements to make.  What?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Thank you to The Blaze, by the way.  Someone told me I'm prominently featured on The Blaze.  I like The Blaze.  Thank you.  And ‚Äì  Stunt brain works for The Blaze.  Yes.  Certainly does.  You see that dirty hippie picture of him you posted?  No.  That was fucking funny.  Was he Twittered or on The Blaze?  Yeah, I think it was Twittered.  But he ‚Äì oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  He's got fucking, like, long hippie hair and pretty funny.  Mike.  Oh, what a good website.  Our pal Mike.  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  October 18, 19, I'm in Stitches in Lancaster.  25, 26.  Oh, I hope you'll be okay.  The Comedy Club in Rochester and November 1 at the Beacon with Andrew.  Nice.  That's what I have.  And I'm booking Albany as well coming up.  Ooh.  All this material workout shit.  Jimmy Norton.  You're the hardest working man in that seat. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, I am on this side of the room because it's just me and Sam.  Of course.  Sounds lazy.  We're going to do a Jocktober?  I think so.  I'm psyched for that.  Maybe some other things we'll see, right?  All right.  All right.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  And now back to The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Call me.  Call me.  Call me. 
[02:29:30]  Call me.  Call me.  Any time.  Call me.  Call me.  All right.  You can't.  Call me any day.  Is it Blondie's birthday?  Let me see.  Uh-oh.  Nope.  Not Blondie's birthday.  All right.  All right.  Coming around.  Oh.  Boehner wants Obama to call him. 
[02:30:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Clever.  Very clever.  That is a good one.  Who blinks first?  Is the headline today.  Who blinks first down there in Washington, D.C.?  Not Obama.  Obama is the president and is much too arrogant to blink.  I think he, um, yeah, I think he thinks, you know, he's doing the right thing.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I, I, I think as time goes on, this will bode worse for the Republicans than it will Obama and his ilk.  I think the longer it goes on, the more people blame the Republicans for trying to use it, uh, to get what they want or don't want as far as Obamacare goes.  And, um, that's pretty much what people will hear on the news.  Sure.  So.  Whatever.  Yeah.  I hear it's not very affordable, though, the Affordable Health Care Act. 
[02:31:00]  I was talking about it before.  It's just, uh, people have gone to the site.  They've checked.  They don't make a lot of money.  They don't qualify for subsidies.  But they have to get this insurance.  And it's a lot more expensive than they thought.  Um, one guy was talking about the fact that he was paying 500 and something for 100% coverage under this policy.  He would have to pay, uh, premiums of, uh, closer to $800 for an 80% coverage under, um, Obamacare.  It's, uh, yeah.  So at what level do you start getting fucked by this? 
[02:31:30]  I think.  Because if you're poor and all that, this is great, right?  But I think you've got to be, like, poor, poor.  Like, fucking, you don't contribute anything to this country poor.  And, uh, then you get government subsidies for the health care.  Right.  Other than that, you have to choose a health care provider, supposedly their discount, uh, affordable health care act rates.  But people that have been researching, looking online and trying to pick an insurance provider and, uh, type a plan say that they're all ridiculously expensive. 
[02:32:00]  And, uh, it's not helping them that, that it's mandatory that they get this insurance.  It's, it's a weird thing.  I mean, people, I think a lot of people are under the false impression that this was free health care, like, uh, England or Canada, when it's not.  You know, this is, uh, something that the government has, has dubbed, uh, mandatory for people.  But you have to pay for it.  It's, it's fucked up. 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  I would love to hear from the average Joes.  And how much of a pain this, pain in the ass this is for them.  Ah, what the hell?  I don't even look anymore.  Joe, I, the doctor tells me to take an aspirin.  What the hell do I know?  Is that it?  Ah, what are you going to do?  Apple a day?  Apple a day.  I show up to work on time.  I have my container of coffee.  Ah, you do the rest.  The heck do I know?  Of course.  Yeah.  I put a muffin in my lunch pail.  All of a sudden, what?  I'm not going to live to be 60?  60.  What do I got to do?  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Then again, I don't give a fuck about what the average Joe has to say.  Average Joe.  That's what we just heard from.  Regular Joe.  Yeah, you want to stay healthy, you show up to work on time, you do the job.  There you go.  You carry the lunch pail, you lift up the rocks, you do the shoveling.  Well, you're a union guy.  You get benefits, though.  Of course I do.  Health, everything's paid for.  So you don't have to.  Union man all the way.  So now you don't have to, uh, you don't have to worry about health.  Ah, Obamacare.  They ought to call it Obama.  Don't care.  What the hell do I know?  Do you hear at Carnegie Hall, some of those reunion guys that work over there, $400,000 
[02:33:30]  a year?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  That's why they take, what is it, 60%?  Yeah.  Like, I'm doing the beacon.  I don't even want to sell merch at the beacon.  60-40 split with the fucking venue.  They get more?  No, no.  They get less.  But four.  Oh.  They get almost 50% of your fucking merch money.  Of your creativity.  And the union guy got to sell it.  Got to get the union guy.  Oh, fucking sickening.  Same, same fucking type of organization keeping UFC out of New York. 
[02:34:00]  It's extortion.  It's, it's just repulsive.  Mob tactics.  Repulsive.  What about the Carnegie guys?  Uh, they were, they were striking.  Apparently they're, they're building some new parts over at Carnegie Hall and there was,  um.  They're redoing the entire inside.  Yeah, but they were, they were having some disagreements as to if unions were going to  be used in certain areas of the facility.  And of course they started getting all pissed off and yes, we need unions everywhere in here. 
[02:34:30]  And then they started digging a little deeper and realized some of these guys were making  upwards of 400,000 a year.  And, uh, they kind of backed off after that.  Like, Ooh, let's not talk about how much we make.  Why not?  Well, it seems like it's excessive.  Yeah.  400,000.  I get, I got no problem with a guy making that kind of money.  Hey, whatever.  But you've got to allow us to wet our beaks to draw from the well.  Like a, what was he?  Some fucking shop steward or whatever?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's fair. 
[02:35:00]  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  But if the guy's doing $400,000 worth of work, I don't have a problem with it.  Like, you know, I don't say guys shouldn't make that kind of money if he's worth it.  Like crane operator.  Like those guys, I understand why those guys make a shitload of money.  Yeah.  It's a rare skill to be able to fucking operate a crane at 80 stories.  I don't want some regular fucking idiot doing that.  No.  I want a skilled guy.  Ray, he's talking about you, Ray.  Who's Ray?  Crane operator in Philly.  Oh, he doesn't have to call him Ray.  We got a lot of union guys to listen to us. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  And I'm, I, I think that, but if it, without unions, upper management would just treat you  like a piece of garbage.  So it's like, where, where's the fucking middle?  Cause you know, big business had its chance for many years and it did not treat the average  worker well.  I think, um, you know, there was definitely a reason to have it, but it got excessive.  I honestly believe, and I'm not alone in this and it's not a far out fucking notion.  The unions destroyed the, uh, auto industry, um, especially in, uh, you know, the likes 
[02:36:00]  of, you look at Michigan, Detroit and whatnot, uh, destroyed them.  The, the, the, the, the, the rates they had to pay for their pensions and for, uh, the  pay, uh, for, for some of these employees, management, what they were getting.  It's just, it fucking destroyed the auto industry and in turn destroyed those cities.  You look at Flint and fucking Detroit.  They were thriving, uh, areas, um, back in the day, back in the day. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, there are other things.  I don't think that the democratic fucking, uh, city council and everything helped.  Uh, I think a lot of corruption, fuck things up.  But when you have a city that completely lost its, uh, ability to produce profitably, you  fucked them over.  You fucked yourself out of jobs.  They lost their mojo.  Mm.  We got a guy that has a bad experience with the new healthcare policy. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, yes.  For one, uh, what's up, Travis?  Hey boys, how you doing?  All right.  How much you make about a year?  Uh, I make about 85.  All right.  Dollars?  Just how do you live?  Just out of, for, and how many kids you got?  Oh, I got no kids, but I'm married.  All right.  No kids married.  You got 85 G's coming in.  What about your, uh, your wife there?  Uh, she makes about 45.  All right.  So you're, you've got some, uh, healthy money coming in. 
[02:37:30]  So what was your experience?  So I have a, my wife works for a big company.  She has her own plan.  I have a single plan that I've had for six, seven years.  And, uh, I'm 32 years old.  Costs me about $115 a month.  And it's a decent plan, you know, like a modest, deductible.  Well, it's tripled now.  It's, it's like, well, quite true.  It's like $300 a month now for me.  So I went from $115 to $300.  And I've got no kids.  I've got friends who are, who went from like $300 a month with a kid, $400 a month to $800 a month, $900 a month. 
[02:38:00]  And they're talking $5,000 to $10,000 deductibles on some of these things.  That's just not fair, man.  It's not ready to be rolled out.  No, this is really bad.  I have a, I have a more expensive plan with a higher deductible.  So when, when the president started talking about the ACA, he was talking about you, you would get to keep your plan several times.  I definitely didn't think you could keep my plan.  It's nowhere near the same plan. 
[02:38:30]  And it's a lot more expensive.  You know, this would be like acceptable.  I wouldn't mind it as much if I thought we were just doing the right thing, but we're such a dumb cunt country with money and we waste it in so many places.  That's where this becomes really offensive.  It's like, you got to pay more money.  And I keep using that example.  We throw billions of dollars at other shit countries to help them build their fucking dog shit infrastructure.  And we have our own citizens spending.  It's unbelievable.  How about we spend the money we have right?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  We'll start there at least.  The subsidies are really odd too.  If you could check the average household is three people.  I think you only qualify, you qualify for a subsidy if your household income is, it's right at $79,000.  So that represents a substantial part of the population.  It's something like 21% of us are subsidizing 79%.  If you go by the average household, it's three.  Someone's going to kill me on the math. 
[02:39:30]  But it was something I was looking at Wikipedia and averaging incomes and things like that.  That's what I'm based on.  But it's a backdoor tax.  That's all it is.  Wouldn't you love to see how much money this entire health care system is going to cost and take how much money we waste overseas and other countries and see if we could cut that in half or into a third by stop giving money to this dog shit society, stop putting our troops here, stop getting off the fucking DMZ in Korea.  All this shit, if we pull these people back and put them into the economy and let them work and stop wasting our fucking money. 
[02:40:00]  We'd rather take care of people in other countries.  It won't cost a dime.  Remember, Obama said that.  He said he's up at the podium.  He said this affordable health care will not cost a dime.  Well, he was talking to those people.  Oh, because a lot of dimes are coming out of people's fucking pockets in penalties.  This penalty fee, if you don't want to take the insurance, is retarded.  We're paying for...  Oh, sorry.  No, I was just going to say it's annoying for us, but it's really hurting the middle class. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's more than an annoyance to those people.  Yeah, I mean...  It's another fucking bill they've got to deal with.  Or a large one, certainly.  That's a massive increase in your bill.  Right.  That's a massive increase in your bill.  Oh, it's disgusting.  Thank you.  This is how it breaks down, too.  The same people that didn't mind paying for the war in Iraq, which was a waste, and I  was for it at first, and I was against it, are the same people that are annoyed at this.  And the same people that were annoyed at the war in Iraq don't mind paying for this,  but they don't mind giving our money away. 
[02:41:00]  Also, it's just...  There's no...  A bunch of dumb fucks.  You're right.  We can't agree on fucking anything.  No.  No.  As we sit here with a government that isn't working.  Right.  Because they can't agree.  Yeah.  We've got to go back to the auto industry, because you've got some  people...  Oh, right.  You woke some people up.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike.  Michael.  You know, what happened to the talk about the executives getting $5 million a year  and $116 million retirement packages?  Absolutely.  That's also a tremendously sickening part of the equation. 
[02:41:30]  Talking about everybody, everybody that destroyed the auto industry through greed.  We've talked about them a lot, man.  Just not this last minute, but we have bashed them, too.  Okay.  I thought you said that it was the union workers, the pensions, and the stuff like that.  It is.  That has a lot to do with...  That has a lot to do with it.  They couldn't afford...  As more and more people kept retiring from their jobs, they couldn't afford to pay off  all these fucking pensions and keep the factories open. 
[02:42:00]  One of the key reasons is because the companies invested the pension money back into the business...  Tangiers.  ...and on top of that, gave those $5 and $10 million retirement packages.  Interstate Bakery was in bankrupt, and they were getting $100 million freaking bonuses.  Yeah.  I mean, management has behaved like absolute pigs.  It's all greed.  And dude, my experience with the unions, and the reason I turned on unions, is just from  performing in venues and seeing what they expect for doing nothing and somehow how unreasonable 
[02:42:30]  they are.  Like, my own personal experience has turned me against them.  Like, that's why.  My father was a union guy.  My dad was a teamster and, you know, for years was a shop steward and all that shit.  But just having dealt with them on my level and what I've seen from the outside, I've  become very, very frustrated with them.  Yeah.  Can I just give a quick example in the city of New York?  If the unions weren't the city of New York, how much money do you think these people would  make per week?  Do you think they'd still be able to live in the city?  I don't know.  That's a big part of it, too. 
[02:43:00]  That's where business has become.  Business is scum and would never treat their people well.  But do you think that it's fair that because the Fertittas have a non-union casino in Vegas,  that whatever the culinary, whatever the union is that's fighting them here should be fighting  them in New York?  I mean, that's just disgusting.  And I don't think the answer is extorting huge amounts of money from the companies to  pay these employees that much money.  I think, you know, base it on merit, everything else, which it was supposed to be based on. 
[02:43:30]  But going back, is it OK for them to extort the money they give to the executives?  No, not at all, dude.  No, where were you extorting from at that point?  I mean, if you're a union, you could use things like blackmail, threats of fucking work stoppages,  even violence to get what you want.  It's a strong arm muscle mob tactic that the unions have been using for years.  That's extortion.  But if, like, the only thing I would say to that is that it's like the big management, 
[02:44:00]  because we've dealt with management, they never just give because they're good.  Like, they never just give because you deserve it.  It's always a fight.  Yeah, well, it's that delicate balance between the workers and management.  But I think both of them are very guilty of trying to screw the other one.  All right, let me go to an auto executive.  Hitler, you're on the phone.  By the way, I just hung up on that guy.  I didn't mean to hang up on you.  Thanks for your call.  Let's go to Greg in Texas.  Greg.  Greg. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, guys.  Caveat mTOR, Greg, when you're buying a car.  Caveat mTOR.  What's that?  Let the buyer beware.  Oh.  That's when Greg brought the jalopy from his friend, and it was a piece of shit.  And, yeah.  Over $2,200 of every time you buy a GM product, $2,200 of that goes to paying legacy employees.  In other words, they're retirees of GM products.  That's how bad the unions have stuck it to the manufacturers over the years. 
[02:45:00]  And that's what's driven the auto business, you know, down the tubes.  Down here, down south, you know, we've driven the unions out.  It's a right-to-work state.  You know, our property, I mean, our home prices, everything is balanced out.  You know, here, a very nice home costs $180,000, where up north, it's, you know, half a million, three-quarters of a million dollars.  I don't know where it came up that the company you work for is responsible for supporting you after you leave the company. 
[02:45:30]  Now, I understand you should get a good rate of pay, a good wage, and from that money, you should set up some type of retirement plan for yourself, whatever it takes.  The fact that the unions were able to strong-arm these companies into giving them pensions, it's ludicrous how much money a line worker will make for the rest of his life, which, by the way, is growing year by year, how long they're going to survive and be paid off for being a line worker in a factory. 
[02:46:00]  Why is that ‚Äì why should that be something the company is obligated to give you?  But doesn't management and those have big ‚Äì have retirement packages, too?  I guess they do.  And, like, Congress is always taken care of for the rest of their lives.  Well, that's fucking ridiculous, too.  Yeah.  It's a limited ‚Äì limited fashion. 
[02:46:30]  Management, they plan their own investments.  They take care of themselves.  That's true, too.  They don't ‚Äì management didn't go in and strong-arm someone into giving them something or will stop working.  All right, you're not going to make any more money.  We're going to leave, and then you can't get a scab because we're going to strike in front of the place, maybe hit people with clubs.  I don't know, unless you give us this.  And then management winds up having their arm behind their back being twisted and going, yeah, we got to fucking give these guys what they want. 
[02:47:00]  It's a thug tactic.  It really is.  And I think they paid for it by unioning themselves out of work, to tell you the truth.  When you've got a 22-year-old kid pushing a broom in a factory making $30 an hour, you've got a job.  Exactly, yes.  That's ridiculous.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  I'll end up like Jimmy Hoffa, though.  Leave me alone.  They've just become unreasonable, and that's the frustrating part.  There's a real purpose for unions, and big business will stick a dick in you. 
[02:47:30]  Like you said with the health care, is our cost really going to go down?  Have they ever just done the right thing?  Of course not.  Never.  There's a reason why they have to do what they're doing, but then we never benefit from it in the end.  Yeah, the companies never, ever just do the right thing.  Look at your fucking health care plan statement the next couple of months where it comes in.  You will notice an increase for sure.  And it's already ridiculously high.  I don't know how people are supposed to survive out there.  It's disgusting.  I know.  We're very lucky.  I understand that.  Yes, we are.  And so is everyone who gets to hear us. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, please.  We're like medicine to people.  You know, laughter is the best medicine.  They say that.  Yeah.  I got middle class all around me, and they're fucking struggling, man.  It's ridiculous.  That's why I don't go near them.  No.  It's ridiculous.  Staying my own type of people.  That's right.  Homosexuals.  Idiots.  Got trunks.  Got to work your balls off just to barely survive. 
[02:48:30]  What fun is life after a while?  Just busting your ass.  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It's Jack Tobey.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  It's not very nice.  It's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jack Tobey. 
[02:49:00]  O-M-P-E.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Oh, my God.  Jack Tobey.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Pop.  Pop.  Doing something a little different today.  Uh-oh.  Mixing up Jack Tobey a little bit.  Don't worry.  No Denny today.  No Denny.  Although he would fit perfectly in with this one. 
[02:49:30]  I don't even...  After the debacle that he was last week, I don't think he can fit perfectly in anything.  You don't think he can deliver anything?  No.  We're going to focus on Monday with today's Jack Tobey.  So I'm thinking maybe Denny might have something to add to this.  I think it's a bad, bad, bad idea.  I don't think he has to sit in, but maybe at the end of this he can give us a little...  Very bad.  A little something.  Very bad.  Are you sure?  No.  Let him email it and Sam can read it.  Uh-huh.  Really?  Horrible idea.  The people didn't like him being involved in Jack Tobey.  Hated him.  Didn't like him.  You sure?  Positive.  Yeah.  We'll be featuring a show tomorrow, but today... 
[02:50:00]  Well, today I decided that...  Because as I'm listening to other shows as we go, I see what they're doing right and wrong.  Oh.  Oh.  And so I figured I'd prep you guys a show today.  Prepped?  Yeah.  I'd give you guys a great Monday show.  What's prep?  What the hell is that word?  It's like a work that's done before on the air.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, yeah.  That's stupid.  So you set us up for a show like that would be featured on Jocktober. 
[02:50:30]  And guess what?  Why prep when you have Prep Burger?  Prep Burger.  That's right.  The radio preparation site.  That's right.  You know how we were talking about the Bible earlier?  Uh-huh.  The Bible of the lame-ass fucking radio show is Prep Burger.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You pay a few bucks.  Usually the radio station pays the few bucks.  You don't even have to pay for it yourself.  No.  And the material comes rolling in for you.  Lazy fucks. 
[02:51:00]  Comes rolling in.  Oh, yeah.  Not only does the material come rolling in.  Yeah.  But the sentences with which you can set up the material are also supplied for you by Prep  Burger.  You basically don't have to do anything.  No.  Nice.  You just piece it together like a puzzle.  You grab some shit from Prep Burger and you got yourself a radio show.  The problem is Prep Burger stinks.  Oh, that's it.  All the material is god awful, you mean?  Stinks.  But why the fuck are people in radio, a creative business, going to this for their thoughts? 
[02:51:30]  Like, what fucking lazy shits?  Oh, boy.  What no talents?  We showed everyone a long time ago there's no creativity in this fucking business.  Yeah, they're not creative people.  Are you a member of the second one?  I have a membership.  Wow.  Whoa.  How much does it cost?  I don't know.  I have access.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Is it hard to get access?  I think you should have to buy access.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's expensive, right?  Can we sign on right now?  Do you have to contribute to Prep Burger? 
[02:52:00]  Do I?  No.  I was part of one prep service early on in my career.  Oh, the trade one.  Yeah.  But you had to contribute.  So you threw what hopefully was some of your creativity out there and people go, oh, wow,  I kind of like that.  What was it called?  Bit something?  It was Kid Craddock's company.  Bit board.  Bit board.  It wasn't.  Bit board.  That's what people were when they listened to the bits.  Bit board.  I tapped out because I saw that I wasn't getting much out of it. 
[02:52:30]  And I was like, why am I wasting some of this shit?  Because then I would get compliments on the stuff I gave.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  But I can't use any of this other stuff.  Yeah.  But the concept was good.  You had to contribute to it.  So, you know, you give a little nugget or two.  And then you would find cool little things like maybe phone numbers and things you would  never find on your own, you know, for, you know, weird shit.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Or a good phone topic, believe it or not.  I'm talking early, early on before you really had to spread your fucking wings and do it 
[02:53:00]  yourself.  But at least helped you out a little bit to kind of put a radio show together.  It's literally like doing stand up with joke books.  Right.  Right.  Three or four joke books like in the on deck circle before you go on that you can rip through  real quick.  Yeah.  Do some mad libs.  Yeah.  But I mean, like the comedy table where you guys sort of in a weird way are exchanging  ideas or like, you know what?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  But I mean, this prep burger is all they have a staff and that's it.  And they shove this shit out there and people are fucking. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  This isn't like a social network where you exchange ideas and kind of bounce off each  other.  This is, oh, I'm not a creative or funny person.  Right.  But I've been putting it.  You probably maybe I'm the program director of a station.  And instead of hiring a morning guy, I just bought a membership to prep burger.  Yeah.  No, I outgrew a bit board, you know, big time.  But I would have been I would have been embarrassed if I was just taking, you know, bits like that  and just make it believe it was my own.  That not good. 
[02:54:00]  Bit board.  That's what a beaver did.  So prep burger starts with the Monday song.  I figured I'd give you a few Monday songs.  Oh, there were more than one.  There's a reason why I can't open this up.  Yeah, you can open it.  Well, let me tell you, some people, they don't like Mondays.  True.  So what starts the work week again?  I think a good radio show with a little Monday song could could help you get through  the day.  Do you hate Mondays?  Oh, I go to the Monday.  And this song is for you. 
[02:54:30]  Thanks to prep burger.  Don't add.  They give you the setup.  Oh, do they?  What?  Just just do the setup as it is.  Because you said thanks for prep burger.  That's not part of the setup.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Oh, they even give you the setup thing that says set up.  So they even tell you how to tell you how to front sell it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  That sentence.  So the setup from prep burgers.  It's like, look, this is all you have to do.  Don't panic.  Don't panic, radio guy.  Be a no talent.  Here's how you make it work.  Don't panic, radio guy. 
[02:55:00]  This is all you have to do.  And the setup is, do you hate Mondays?  Then this song is for you.  Oh, hey, man.  Oh, hey.  Wish I was laying down, but my lung block.  A lung block.  With a loud ringing sound, had to wake up.  Soon at work I will be back.  Yeah.  And I'm feeling so unhappy.  Hey, man.  Back to bed. 
[02:55:30]  I should go while it's traffic.  Moving so freaking slow.  I'm stuck here.  Freaking easy.  Fuck yeah.  It's rush hour time.  Can't wait till the weekend.  Yeah.  All right.  Kill porn.  Kill porn.  That's why I always say, I hate Monday.  That's why I always say, I hate Monday.  Who plays this?  Who plays this?  Stop.  I really get annoyed.  Sleeping late is what I enjoy.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  That's why I always say, I hate Monday.  That's exactly how I feel.  Hate Mondays.  Hate Mondays.  Monday.  That's good.  Fucking hilarious.  You like that shit?  Fuck yeah.  It's clean humor.  Of course, Chip liked it.  My mother loves that stuff.  I wonder who, what show would play that?  I don't know.  What fucking type of show?  They're in business, so people are paying for this shit.  Local market.  The guy and the girl.  Very small market.  Dude, we ought to do a show one day.  A four hour show. 
[02:56:30]  Directly from Prep Burger.  Just all prepped.  Absolutely.  And not break character.  And not break character.  And not be ironic about it.  But we should do a Prep Burger show.  Well, we shouldn't have given it away.  Well, no.  But I mean, we have to.  Because people wouldn't turn us off.  They believe you didn't hear Jimmy.  Yeah.  No, you'd want to think, what the fuck are they doing?  No, but I want them to pretend that we haven't been doing a Prep Burger show.  Oh.  Would the girls over at Mashup play that?  At least they make their own songs.  Uh-huh.  They do make their own songs.  We beat the gals up all the time. 
[02:57:00]  But they at least make up their own.  Those chicks.  Look, this is theirs.  They didn't get this for Prep Burger.  They have a Monday song.  They do it themselves, though.  Yeah.  That's why we're sleeping.  Who fucked up their part in there?  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  That, that.  Sleepy on Monday morning.  They didn't, they didn't, they didn't figure, they didn't want to do it over? 
[02:57:30]  No, it's just whimsical.  Like the whiskey laugh.  That's a good one.  We should have a Monday morning song, though.  Yeah.  Although, yeah, well, we all live different lives about.  Well, we could have a Monday.  I could have one about Guinness shits and fucking hangover and Guinness shits.  Yeah.  How about we do a Monday song contest?  Oh, man.  Come on.  Change it up a little bit.  Yeah.  We should have a Monday song contest.  Oh, God.  Look, you got a week to get your Monday songs in. 
[02:58:00]  There's creative guys out there.  They're begging to just get a little exposure.  Yeah.  The Monday song contest is official.  Could use any character on the show, obviously.  Oh, boy.  This is open to anyone.  Yes.  All of us.  All right.  It goes an inch further.  Yeah.  Oh.  And they supply the lyrics.  And on some of these songs, you can just download the bed and then use their lyrics.  If you're talented enough to sing over it.  And then people go, oh, it's your song.  Wow.  So people will hear their voice.  I hear your voice.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  That's great.  That's good.  Yeah.  Bunch of different layers with this prep burger.  Oh, yeah.  I got a fucking Monday song that's going to knock your socks off.  What's it called?  Monday Sucker Bag of Peckers.  Well, there's another Monday song here.  Yeah.  Now, unfortunately, this one doesn't have a setup, so it may be awkward.  All right.  Why do I ask?  I don't know how to set this up because they didn't give the setup for this next track,  guys.  How do we set this up?  Uh-oh.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  You need a setup.  Uh-oh.  The first one had the setup, Do You Hate Mondays?  Then this song is for you and you hate it.  You'd be paralyzed at the mic now.  Yeah.  You'd be like, I don't know what to do.  There's a Monday song here.  I don't know how to set it up, though.  Maybe it's just meant to be played in between two songs.  Yeah.  Word.  Hey, it's Monday.  Is that good?  It's not great.  Who wants to try it?  Oh, man.  Is this another Monday song?  Yeah.  Yeah, but they didn't give us the setup, so I don't know how to fucking do this.  I don't know if Chip would want to jump in because he's got aspirations to do stuff  like this. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, they could go, I hate Sundays because it excludes daughters.  Here's Monday.  Oh, that's horrible.  Monday coffee.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Just what I need.  Uh-huh.  Monday coffee.  Just as long as it's full of caffeine.  Oh, okay.  Obviously.  Oh, Monday coffee.  I'll drink you black or with sugar and cream. 
[03:00:00]  That's a good one.  Oh, Monday coffee.  Without two cups, I can't even think.  Every other day, every other day, every other day, every other day, my coffee's weak, yeah.  Why?  But when every Monday comes, but when every Monday comes, the coffee's fine.  All of the time.  Monday coffee. 
[03:00:30]  Good harmonies.  Look at them that.  That's just what I need.  Wouldn't it be great?  Monday coffee.  Is it that vicious all of a sudden?  Don't give me decaf.  Shove it up your mother.  It's kind of.  I don't believe anyone uses Tart Burger.  There's no fucking way.  Who's playing that?  It's Monday coffee.  Monday coffee.  It gives me the shit.  La, la, la.  La, la, la. 
[03:01:00]  Monday coffee.  That's terrible.  Do I give away track three or do I do the setup?  You have to do the setup.  Do the setup.  Because otherwise, you're going to lose some of the humor in the song.  Oh.  Humor.  And it's a fun setup, too.  It's a nice one.  People are going to say, man, the Opster is on fire this morning.  Oh, shit.  The answer is waking up on this day is the hardest.  The question is, what is Monday? 
[03:01:30]  That's like Jeopardy, right?  I'll take another hour in bed for a thousand, Alex.  The morning is the time I think.  Waking up sure stinks.  But every day I drag myself out of my bed.  No, my brain is healing dead.  Get some head.  Go to work.  I have no choice.  Guess I should be lost. 
[03:02:00]  I'm a list voice.  I have a job.  I hope my boss will not tell me that my job's in jeopardy.  I've got VD.  Oh, God.  We missed a punchline, though.  No.  What was the punchline?  Oh.  We have to replay it.  My job's in jeopardy.  My boss will not tell me that my job's in jeopardy.  Ah, jeopardy.  It's a theme song. 
[03:02:30]  Do you think they just sit around Prep Burger and go like, just fucking.  I can't believe anyone's buying into this shit.  Yeah.  And like having no, like, let's just, give me the jeopardy theme.  I'm just going to fucking lay down some real shit.  Yeah.  Just real quick.  Just throw whatever shit we have.  It's garbage.  You know, we do have all the radio guys that listen to our radio show.  Who's this?  I'm a muscle here.  This is Danielle.  Oh, Danielle.  And the ladies that are also here.  Hello.  What's up, Danielle?  Yes, I worked at a little rinky-dink radio station.  It was kind of a nightmare, but I got yelled at for not using Prep Burger. 
[03:03:00]  So you got yelled at for trying to maybe do something different.  Yeah.  I did my own research, and yes, I admit I've used a fun fact or two, but I had to do my  own research, and they're like, why aren't you using Prep Burger?  That's not right.  Maybe your setups weren't as good as the ones supplied by Prep Burger.  That's true.  Did you hear the one Opie just did with the Jeopardy?  What is?  You guys are too cynical.  I have a good laugh on the way to work listening to stuff.  You like it?  Yeah, sure I do.  Who the heck likes a Monday? 
[03:03:30]  Not me.  My wife says, ah, Joe, you want to go back to bed?  I go, yeah, don't pay the bills.  Get me some coffee.  Joe likes getting out of bed and getting the coffee.  Heck, I do.  By the way, that wasn't a Prep Burger setup.  That was my setup.  Oh, even the part where you said, I'll take another hour in bed for a thousand, Alex.  Wow.  It was all you.  I thought that was Prep Burger.  Nope, nope, nope.  Damn.  Nice.  Very good.  Thanks, lady on the phone.  I forgot your name already.  Thanks, man.  Whatever. 
[03:04:00]  Thank you.  All right.  That would be very funny.  We don't have a setup for the next one.  Shit.  This is going to get awkward.  Now what?  We're like just paralyzed with fear if there's no setup.  I don't know.  It's another Monday song, I guess.  You could read the title and then everybody could have fun guessing what song they may be parodying.  Okay.  Stop the Mondays.  Stop the Monday.  Shock the monkey.  Ugh.  No way.  Damn, that might be good.  Stop the Mondays.  Stop the Mondays. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, no.  You don't think they would ever do that, do you?  No, that's dumb.  Wait.  That's stupid, right?  Oh, I know.  Like the Supreme.  Stop the Mondays.  Wow, it was?  Stop the, shock the monkey.  Oh, is it shock the monkey?  All right.  Oh, no.  It couldn't be that stupid, could it?  Well, at least we got a bit out of these prep burger guys.  We're going to do our-  Monday, Monday, Monday.  No, it couldn't sound like that, could it?  Stop the Mondays.  We're doing a Monday song contest.  I'm so excited.  That's right.  You think it'll be as good as these? 
[03:05:00]  Fuck yeah.  Stop.  To be fair, this is a real Monday song contest.  Everybody that submits a song for the contest also has to submit a setup.  We need a nice setup-  Relax.  For somebody to read-  Relax.  Before the song comes on.  Here's another dumb Monday song.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Are you on track four or five?  Four.  Oh, maybe they got mixed up.  That's a safety dance.  Because that one's got a setup. 
[03:05:30]  Which one has the setup?  The one that you just played.  Doing the Monday dance?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's-  What's with the Monday songs?  Well, because that-  Prep burger.  It's all about Monday.  It's terrible.  Prep burger.  All right.  I got the setup for this one.  Yeah, you got the setup.  I do.  Good.  I'm not reading it.  No.  Spill hot coffee all over yourself at the office, and you'll be doing the Monday dance!  Oh, guys! 
[03:06:00]  M-O-M-D-A-Y Monday.  It's not even safety dance.  It doesn't make sense.  You can sleep if you want to.  Oh.  But you won't get to work on time.  Oh, she won't.  If the traffic's jammed, your boss is the man who will be an angry guy.  I say, go to work, but you have to.  Oh.  Because you got to pay your bills.  Now you're in a bad mood. 
[03:06:30]  You made a bad move.  On your desk, hot coffee spills.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  On your pants.  On your pants.  Jumping up, you're waving your hands.  Oh, no.  You came in your pants.  People laughing.  You were good if you had a chance.  Oh.  Doing the Monday dance.  Oh.  Oh.  Because coffee spills on your lap, so you get up and you...  Yeah.  It's a Monday dance.  It looks like you're dancing.  Well, it's a Monday dance.  Your cock and balls are scarred.  Yes.  Well, it's a Monday dance.  It's the Monday dance.  All right.  Jesus. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  It just gets you mad.  Incredibly bad.  It's the Monday dance.  You just spilled coffee all over your fucking bag.  Yeah.  You spilled coffee on your dick.  Scalding coffee on your fucking life-giving bag.  Life-giving bag.  And you jump back, screaming.  The Monday dance.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave in California.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  You guys have featured Lamont and Cannelli before on October.  They stink.  They play this stuff every day. 
[03:07:30]  Do they really prep burger?  Oh, yeah.  And I work with people that think it's funny, and they do the hackiest little...  They call it the sting of the day bits, like the fake phone calls.  And people think it's real.  It's so embarrassing.  Now, do we have any examples of shows using these songs?  I wish we had those.  I mean, we've played them a hundred times.  Yeah.  The Monday dance.  I like the Monday dance.  I do, too.  We all should do a little Monday dance.  Yeah, I do it all the time. 
[03:08:00]  What did you get?  Why?  What?  Spill a little coffee and you laugh.  And you do the Monday dance.  Enough about the coffee.  Right.  Jesus, we get it.  You bang your cock on the edge of the desk.  And your helmet gets ripped.  You've got blood in your pants.  Zip your dick in your zipper.  You're bleeding from...  Yeah.  You do the Monday dance.  Your hemorrhoids are bleeding.  And your white salad pants.  I've got very good news.  We have another Monday song. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, my God.  I love a good Monday song.  Amazing.  And I just want to hammer it home.  We're officially doing the Monday song contest on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, have at it.  And we'll play them next Monday.  It's going to be hard not to play them before Monday, I think.  But hopefully we'll have a few good ones by next week.  All right.  Here's another Monday song.  No set up.  So, I hope that was good enough.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I nailed it.  Yes, you did. 
[03:09:00]  Why would you want to stop the Monday, though?  Wouldn't you want it to fly by?  Oh, stop it.  Get it over with.  Not on Sunday.  Oh.  Good quality, though.  I was giving that.  I was off to work to make my green.  I was giving my caffeine.  Oh, more coffee.  Shit.  More caffeine.  I want to be. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  I hate Mondays.  Mondays.  Mondays.  Oh, wow.  How I wish that I could stop the Mondays.  Oh.  Is this right?  Stop the Mondays.  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, that was.  Well.  That was good.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Are we done with Monday songs?  I hope not.  Yeah, we are.  We're featuring Prep Burger, by the way, for Jacktober today.  By the way, there's enough Monday songs that we could easily do this every Monday. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, my God.  There were more?  Oh, there's tons of them.  Yeah.  And I got tons of Friday songs.  I got lots of stuff for you guys.  Tuesday really takes it in the ass, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  No one cares.  Tuesday's gone.  Let's go.  No one cares about Tuesday.  All right.  Tuesday is just a bridge to midweek.  Friday.  From Monday.  Fridays, though, has got to be what?  Party songs, right?  Yo, yeah.  Whistles blowing.  Yeah, it's Friday.  But enough about these songs.  It's like, we could play songs all day.  I thought I'd bring you guys some bits. 
[03:10:30]  That's right, Sam.  Yeah.  Want to use your phone to get fit in time for all the holiday parties?  What?  What holiday parties?  Use my phone to get fit?  Yeah, there's an app for that.  Wow.  What holiday?  Well, sort of an app.  What is that?  My kids have that on the phone, an app.  What is that?  Well, take a listen to this new sponsor we just got in, and you'll hear what I mean.  Introducing the Cell Phone Trainer, the virtual fitness trainer that gets you in shape over the phone. 
[03:11:00]  Hello?  Hello, lardbutt.  Drop and give me 50.  Oh, lardbutt.  The Cell Phone Trainer monitors your heart, blood pressure, and level of activity.  And it gives you words of encouragement to keep you motivated.  Hello?  Hey, thunder thighs.  It's time for your two-mile run.  Now, get moving.  Do I have to?  And if words of encouragement don't motivate you, the Cell Phone Trainer will administer an electric shock that will.  Hey, you fat cunt.  Do a jumping jack or you're going to have a stroke in front of your children.  Ow!  I said get moving.  Okay, okay, jeez. 
[03:11:30]  Get the Cell Phone Trainer, new from the makers of the Cell Phone Drill Sergeant.  Cell Phone Trainer.  Cell Phone Trainer.  Man, that's a good one.  Oh, now, that isn't very nice.  That's just funny.  Well, people have trouble losing weight.  It's not nice.  But then there's people going, is that really the sponsor?  That's a crazy sponsor.  Oh, that's good.  I thought it was a real commercial.  You know, I'm out of coffee.  Oh.  You are?  Yeah, I'm out of coffee.  Oh, yeah.  And my morning coffee slave. 
[03:12:00]  I mean, our intern.  Is she still in the shitter?  Oh.  What?  That doesn't say shitter.  That isn't prep burger.  I want prep burger quality.  What are you talking about?  I'm not using prep burger.  How's it go?  I'm using my own setup.  Oh, okay.  She's still in the can.  Yeah.  But I found this number for a coffee refill hotline.  What?  Yeah.  Let's give it a call and see how it works out.  Oh, now.  Thank you for calling our free coffee refill hotline. 
[03:12:30]  To order a cappuccino latte mocha, press four.  To order a caramel macchiato espresso mocha, press five.  To order a vanilla iced chocolate mocha latte strawberry cafe latte coffee with whipped cream and chocolate shaving, press six.  Oh, that's like how my sister gets it.  To order a double espresso, blueberry, cocoa, frozen chocolate mocha toka latte, press seven.  So relatable.  To just order a black coffee, press eight.  Stand by for your refill. 
[03:13:00]  That's me, bro.  Oh, I don't think he meant that.  It worked.  It worked, guys.  I got my coffee.  Where would you play that?  Yeah.  What would be the situation where you would play that?  Did you not hear the setup?  If you needed a death row inmate to pull the switch on himself, you'd pipe that into his headphones and see how many times you can get through it.  That makes more sense.  See, the problem was the morning coffee slave, I mean intern.  What?  Why are you fucking ripping my shit off? 
[03:13:30]  You're right.  I just thought it was so funny.  Stop.  I wanted to jump on board.  Man.  I hate to interrupt, but we have Kate Gosselin on the line.  Is that cool with you guys?  Yeah, I booked her, guys.  A celebrity interview?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  No, we got Kate Gosselin on the line.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  We got Kate Gosselin.  Yeah.  Oh, she's a...  I mean, you know, she's a big, big star.  I don't want to talk about coffee and Monday songs when we have such a big star on the line.  Well, you know, reality TV star, author, public speaker, and mom, Kate Gosselin.  She just published a family-friendly cookbook. 
[03:14:00]  It's going to please the pickiest palates.  It's apparently called Love is in the Mix, and we've got Kate on the phone with us.  Kate, welcome to the show.  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.  Good to be here.  All right.  Well, yeah, you're not actually here, you silly cunt.  You're on the phone.  But let's start off by asking, how do you keep a bunch of kids' assholes clean?  Very carefully.  Oh.  Oh, you know how to have a little fun. 
[03:14:30]  Now, being that you make pornography with them, you know, do you use the same cameras  and same, like, dildo implements for all of them?  Absolutely.  I always tell them I'm not a short-order cook.  So what's for dinner is what's for dinner.  And fortunately, they have good appetites, and I'm pretty good at the kitchen stuff.  So it works out well.  You're a mumbling cunt.  They've rated a lot of my dinners.  They're my recipe testers.  Yeah, yeah.  So they rate them, and there's actually some ratings in the book.  What about nice, big, fat, meaty cocks? 
[03:15:00]  Do they like meat cocks?  No, not per se.  Like, they eat red meat.  I don't.  Some of my older girls are moving away from red meat.  But I do a lot of ground turkey, you know, instead of red meat.  Oh, I don't know what that's called for.  There's not any strict across-the-board vegetarians.  And they're very excited about eating, and I'm very excited about cooking for them.  And I know the basis of this book was people just kept emailing and asking over the years, 
[03:15:30]  what were you making in season two, episode 14?  Yeah, yeah.  I have no clue.  Now, you're going to molest a bunch of children, and you want to feed them.  How many shopping carts do you fill up at the supermarket just to make sure that they  can all eat while they're being molested?  Well, I shop at a lot of different stores.  I'm also into saving and coupons and sales and things.  No.  I've started a new website for couponing.  I don't care, I don't care.  So I do a lot of that.  Normal, like if I'm doing a grocery shop at Whole Foods, let's say, and we don't have 
[03:16:00]  a Whole Foods very close to us.  So if I'm doing that, without a doubt, I'm still in two grocery carts.  But that doesn't mean that's all our groceries for the week.  I buy flour, buy the paper sack, 50 pounds at a time, and that doesn't last very long.  And that's just my white organic wheat flour.  Then I buy, hey, the brown flour, 25 pounds at a time.  And, yes, that's definitely, you know, a loaf of bread doesn't make it through a meal 
[03:16:30]  for us.  And so there's major quantities to be made.  And I used to have a story about grocery shopping.  I used to have a little, I bought a used a few years ago, Audi TT, because I found  myself doing, you know, airport runs and this and that.  A lot of times, you know, it's just me.  So I would stop at Whole Foods on the way to, you know, back from the airport to get groceries.  And I'd have this little car, and it would fill up two parts of groceries.  And my favorite thing was when, you know, they asked if you need help out with the car. 
[03:17:00]  I'd be like, sure, thank you.  So they would flip one part, and I'd flip the other.  But you should have seen their faces when they got to my car.  Two huge parts of groceries, and they'd say, you mean this one?  And I'd say, yeah, yeah, it'll fit.  It's fine.  Two parts of groceries used to fill that entire car.  And I do mean every inch beside my seat.  And I'd drive home and unload my groceries.  Wow.  Hey, I know our own Eric Nagel was at your house recently. 
[03:17:30]  When you open the fridge, anything left?  We do have leftovers.  In fact, that's one of my time-saving tips that I put in there.  I purposely, Monday through Thursday night, I will purposely cook a little extra than I think that we need.  So by Friday night, there's four nights of a little of this and a little of that.  And then we do family buffet night.  And you'll see in my book, I make a little menu for the kids, and they're allowed to choose their favorite thing. 
[03:18:00]  And guess what?  I don't have to cook that fifth night.  And being that there's a lot of acid in your vagina, you obviously go through dildos quickly because it just eats them up and they melt.  So is your dildo bill really high?  No, it's a mortgage.  I mean, it's definitely a major, major mortgage every month.  And it's shocking me even.  It's shocking to even me.  It's going up all the time because food is more expensive.  But not only that, I've got boys who are turning 10. 
[03:18:30]  And I'm telling you, even at that age, I sit here and just watch Colin more.  Yes, please.  I mean, the amount is amazing.  That was a good impression.  Oh, what?  Oh.  I've got to say, when those kids become teens and start dragging home guys to have sex with, that's two people now that you're going to have to feed. 
[03:19:00]  I'm in trouble.  And I know it.  You know what's a really good skill to have, though?  And I feel really, really confident about this.  What, Kate?  In my book is pizza.  I make my own pizza dough.  That probably sucks.  19-inch pizza is like the size of a pizza box, a large pizza at a restaurant.  She calls her pussy.  I can roll them out like it's nobody's business to make organic pizzas.  And it's already my kid's favorite thing.  Like, I'm known as the pizza mom.  And when I've got millions of friends, it's going to be all about pizza. 
[03:19:30]  Because she's got a fucking pepperoni shoved up her asshole.  I can do it.  I can do it.  It's delicious.  Red sauce dripping out of pussy.  I hope they never, ever don't like pizza.  Yeah, we hope not, too.  And we also hope that you're killed by a drunk driver.  Kate Gosselin, your new book is called Love is in the Mix.  And we really appreciate you talking to us because the option was sucking an AIDS dick.  Not a problem.  Have a great day.  Thanks.  Thanks.  All right, there it goes.  That was her big sign-off, not a problem?  Right.  Oh, we appreciate her calling you.  Love is in the mix. 
[03:20:00]  Is she Irish?  Is that what she, um...  There you go.  How did we get that?  Wow.  Kate Gosselin.  See, guys?  That's a get right there.  That's a get for our show.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  You got it.  I guess for these shows that can't get the celebrity guests, you know, you got prep burger.  Yeah, they...  They have an audio file of guests.  Can we do a...  I like guests.  I love guests.  You want to keep doing this with guests?  Oh, please.  Can we find another one for us?  That was phenomenal. 
[03:20:30]  I love guests.  Yes.  Prep burger stinks.  I'm going to do a really good interview with one of these people like that.  No more judging around.  I didn't even see the fucking time.  That's fucked up.  That's nice language.  I thought it was like quarter after nine.  We didn't get to half the shit we wanted to today.  No, we didn't.  You didn't get to see Hulk Hogan's new business venture.  Did you hear about that?  What is this?  I heard of it.  Yes.  You want to see it?  Yeah.  I don't understand, though.  Well, Hulk Hogan has decided that since it's 2013, web hosting is the business of the future. 
[03:21:00]  Ah.  So he's launching Host-a-mania.  What is Host-a-mania?  It's web hosting by Hulk Hogan, the inventor of Hulk-a-mania.  No.  Why?  He should just rent his cock out.  What?  That fucking tuna can.  What the fuck is Host-a-mania?  Why would you go to Hulk Hogan to host your web?  Some website.  Well, Host-a-mania put out an ad. 
[03:21:30]  Like a viral video ad.  Yeah.  And part of it is a parody of the Wrecking Ball video.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Can I see this?  Yeah.  Yes, you may.  We got some Vol?  Sure.  Right.  Vol puts fruit on the trees.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hulk's very bald.  Oh, that's not Hulk.  That's not Hulk.  I really thought it was him.  Oh. 
[03:22:00]  Some guy eating crayons.  Yeah.  Hanging upside down.  It's very strange.  And then an old man who's, like, dressed up as Hulk Hogan.  Huh.  There's Hulk Hogan riding a Wrecking Ball.  Oh, my God.  This is really embarrassing.  What is he doing?  I don't know why he's doing this.  He's in a Wrecking Ball.  Oh, Jesus.  And his ass is showing.  What the fuck is this? 
[03:22:30]  Hulk Hogan is.  Hulk Hogan riding a Wrecking Ball.  What does he do there?  What's that mean?  What is he doing?  I don't know.  Hulk Hogan's riding a Wrecking Ball in a thong.  What the fuck?  What's he hosting?  What does he do?  He hosts your website?  I guess he's launching a website hosting business.  Like he's got a bunch of servers and he's going to put up.  My servers, brother. 
[03:23:00]  They go down.  He doesn't know what to do.  So he just leg drops on them.  Yeah.  So he made a viral video to market it.  Right.  Where he's wearing a thong and riding a Wrecking Ball like Miley Cyrus.  That's funny though.  Hulk is great.  Right.  Oh my God.  I'm a Hulk maniac.  Can you imagine?  He would be.  No, I can't imagine.  The heights that Hulk Hogan reach.  And he's fucking.  And now he's in a thong on a Wrecking Ball doing Miley Cyrus parodies. 
[03:23:30]  And I don't understand with the crayon guy.  I don't either.  Upside down.  And the other old Hulk guy.  Is the old man supposed to be him?  And then he gets on a Wrecking Ball?  I don't know.  Like if you're going to.  If the bit is Hogan in a thong on a Wrecking Ball.  Yeah.  Just do that.  That's right.  There is no context to the rest of it.  No.  Hostomania.  There you have it.  Hostomania.  What?  23 days? 
[03:24:00]  I'm not in.  Why would he agree to that?  I don't know.  Because he's desperate for money?  Yeah.  That wife of his fucking.  I think we know that by now.  Raped him as far as.  He was in a smaller house.  What?  He had to drive the boat by?  Oh.  I swear.  That's one of my favorite things.  Crying Hulk.  Daddy, our dogs.  I know, but we can't pet them or we'll get arrested.  That's my house.  They're 10 feet offshore crying looking at the house they used to live in.  But they couldn't go to it, could they?  I know.  They weren't even allowed to touch the dogs. 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  I don't know, man.  I think that's a comedy clip.  Can we see it real fast?  I can find it.  Sure.  That is a funny one.  Thanks for the prep burger Jacktober today.  I thought it was terrific.  Tomorrow we're going to feature a show.  We're going to go old school, right?  Yeah, definitely.  We'll feature a radio show from somewhere around America.  Don't fret.  And don't forget, every Friday is Scott and Todd Friday.  A treat in itself.  During Jacktober.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie. 
[03:25:00]  I want to see the boat movie.  Put it on the prep sheet that will do the Hogan clip tomorrow.  Okay.  We got shit to do.  Tomorrow I'm going to go see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  It's not out yet, Scott.  I'm going to get an advanced screen into the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  A boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  Oh, he does sound like a tard. 
[03:25:30]  That's great.  Hey, what happened to my signed Sudoku puzzles?  They're starting to sell finally?  Uh-oh.  Fuck yeah.  Or did someone throw them in the garbage?  I don't know.  I got a pile of them on my desk that I didn't realize we even had.  Why aren't they being sold?  I've been stacking them up.  Oh, were they over there the whole time?  Yeah.  For charity.  Timmy, you got anything?  Because we got to go home now.  I do.  A couple things.  The new material workouts.  I think tickets are 15 bucks.  Stitches Comedy Club, Lancaster, October 18 and 19. 
[03:26:00]  The Comedy Club in Rochester, October 25, 26.  The November 1 Beacon Show with Ice is not a material workout.  That's a real show.  And I'm also booking Albany, the Comedy Club up there, in November.  So that will be on sale soon.  And these are all, like, cheap tickets so I can work out material.  And that's what I'm doing.  So I hope you guys come.  Nice.  Go see Jimmy.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  All Pete and Anthony have left the building. 
[03:26:30]  Left.  Left.  Left the building.  After O&A Live.  With Sam Roberts.  Is next.  This.  Is after Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I always feel sad for those.  Like, the Jacktober bits, where we're playing stuff like the prep burger bits and songs.  It actually makes me feel sad. 
[03:27:00]  Because I start thinking of the people, and we all have them in our lives.  There are people in my life who I believe would get in a car, would drive to work, would turn their brain off, and they would chuckle as they listen to those bits.  And it makes me sad because I'm like, like, I don't want to crush your dreams and expose to you how horrible it is that you like this.  But I don't, I don't have any choice.  I don't see any other, any other option. 
[03:27:30]  I just start to, I feel bad because, like, you know, like somebody, or like the nice guy at work, or the nice lady who comes in and she's just happy that she heard something that amused her on the way to work.  She doesn't realize that she has no business being amused by that because it's not funny.  And it's garbage.  It's just, you know, factory-made shit.  But ONA did say that they love guests now. 
[03:28:00]  I heard that.  Well, did you hear the guests today?  Did you hear Kate Gosling?  I booked that, Roland.  Well, do I did right away?  I'd say, oh, my God, who's her publicist?  And then she fired everybody.  I'm like, woo-hoo.  Safe.  Safe.  Am I right?  Talk more about Cox.  Go right ahead.  But you know what I mean?  Like, have you known people that have enjoyed those kind of schlocky morning show bits?  Yeah.  There's so many people.  And in my mind, I'm sitting there wondering, how could this even exist?  How could it happen?  How could a person sit there listening to that and not immediately throw up in their car and turn the radio station? 
[03:28:30]  It's like the Kardashians.  It's easy to watch, so they just figure it's easy to listen to.  That's what it is, right?  You just turn your brain off, and you just laugh wherever you think you're supposed to laugh.  Yeah.  And that's it.  But it's got the artistic merit of an assembly line.  Like, it's just being manufactured to hit somebody at its absolute base.  It's the least intelligent form of entertainment possible.  And I know, okay?  I'm very far down on that spectrum. 
[03:29:00]  That's why Louis has the balls to have no laugh tracks on the show.  When he did Lucky Louis.  Yeah.  He did it with a live audience.  That's different.  Like, because it's not instructing people where to laugh.  Yes.  And people were so weirded out.  When Louis C.K. did Lucky Louis, and he used a real studio audience, one of the criticisms, because that was before everybody loved him.  That was when everybody was criticizing that show, and one of it was that he uses a weird laugh track.  Like, everybody was talking about the strange laugh track he's using, and he's sitting there going, no. 
[03:29:30]  That's actual people laughing at things that are really happening.  Everybody's just not used to hearing it.  It's not the canned laugh.  It's not the canned laughter.  And this is, this prep burger stuff is the radio equivalent of canned laughter.  It's canned bits, and interviews, and interviews.  There are people, maybe that's why I get sad, because I feel like, I feel the same way I feel when I'm watching Long Island Medium. 
[03:30:00]  Because I was watching that a little bit last night, and I don't want to spoil the people who are having a good time.  Like, I don't want to spoil it for them, and let them know that this Long Island Medium is a carny.  Like, she's just using tricks.  She's just asking leading questions, and she starts so broad that by the time she gets specific, it's all information.  She says she doesn't use tricks.  She got mad last time we said that.  Dude, she does.  I watched the show.  I watched how she asks questions.  And she starts very broad, and lets people fill in the information. 
[03:30:30]  It's the same way they all work.  And then as she's narrowing down, she's narrowing down with the information that whoever she's talking to has given her.  She's going, I'm seeing a cruise ship.  And that normally means, like, water or vacation.  We were on vacation.  Okay, you were on vacation.  But the cruise ship thing was, like, so broad that it could have been, like, well, I was at home.  Well, where do you live?  Oh, I live about a mile from the beach.  That's the water.  You know what I mean?  Like, she starts broad with a question like that. 
[03:31:00]  And then she keeps going.  And she's going, I don't know.  For some reason, I'm seeing, like, Fiji.  And she goes, the lady goes, we were on vacation on an island.  She goes, on an island in Fiji?  And she goes, no, near Fiji.  There you go.  That's what he was telling me.  And I'm going, what?  Someone in your family.  And the guy goes, an uncle.  She goes, yes, an uncle.  Right, exactly.  That's what she does.  Because, obviously, if she goes into a room, right, she's going into a room where everybody is there to have spirits talk to them, right? 
[03:31:30]  So everybody has lost someone.  So she knows that somebody in there lost a member of their family.  50, 50, male or female.  Right.  She's got, like, a dozen people in the room.  They're all there for a reading or a spiritual seance or whatever it is.  Who, what dead people are you going to want to talk to who aren't in your family?  So when she's, and she'll start with grandmother.  Everybody's got a dead grandmother.  We're adults. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Everybody's got a dead grandmother.  And I feel bad.  My wife was watching it, and she goes, well, how did she know that that lady was wearing her grandmother's ring?  And I was like, Jess, it was a young woman wearing a ring that was obviously very old.  She saw the ring before she asked the question.  The lady was wearing it.  Oh, I didn't even think of that.  Yes.  And, like, I feel bad, like, spoiling it for people because, like, they have this belief.  But what makes me even more sad is I feel like they're getting taken advantage of. 
[03:32:30]  I'm sure she's expensive.  You know?  Yeah.  She's getting, they're paying hundreds of dollars to have this woman pretend that their dead loved ones are talking.  And it's the same way with this, with the prep burger services.  Like, I feel like the prep burger services and the shows that use them are making their listeners look like complete idiots.  Because their listeners are now driving to work being like, oh, I heard the funniest thing, blah, blah, blah.  It's all lies and propaganda and horseplay. 
[03:33:00]  It's bullshit.  You know?  And it's the same thing the Long Island Medium is doing where people are walking around going, no, I think it's really real.  And I'm like, I don't, like, I don't want to call you an idiot because somebody led you to believe that they were telling the truth.  I think she wanted to come in to prove that she is legit.  She's not legit, dude.  I was watching it.  And obviously she can put her best stuff on TV and she can do editing and all that stuff.  Like, if it doesn't seem legit on television, it's not legit.  Are you telling me my airplane repo show is legit? 
[03:33:30]  Air, I don't know if airplane, I would assume airplane repo is legit just because it's so absurd of a concept.  I don't think anybody would bother faking it.  But, you know, it's one of those things where.  Which is the guy who goes, hello, sweet spirits, hello.  Was that John?  He's like the.  I mean, but people have been busting these people for the whole time.  What was the big one?  John Edwards.  John Edwards got busted doing, I think it was interviews before, like his guest room, the green room or whatever. 
[03:34:00]  That he would have all the people that were in the audience of his talk show.  I believe this was him and I'm not sure.  And this is all my opinion, by the way.  I don't know if.  I mean, the Long Island medium could be real for all I know.  But in my opinion, it seems fake.  That's what I'm saying.  I was analyzing the show and it struck me as tricks.  What she should do is put Bruiser Brody to sleep and then have her come and bring him back.  How did he die?  Why would I put my own cat to sleep?  I don't know.  Just to see.  Just to test.  Just to test. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  I don't think she can bring cats back to life.  I don't think she's ever claimed to.  But you say, like, why did you put him to sleep?  And you're like, aha.  Yeah.  He's talking.  I mean, John Edwards could be real for all I know.  But I believe, in my opinion, that this stuff is probably people being taken advantage of.  Matt in New Jersey.  Hey, Sam.  I completely agree with you.  I think it's so fucked up to make money off people's emotions.  That being said, my mom made me go see John Edwards this summer at a theater in Jersey.  And it was pretty fucking wild. 
[03:35:00]  The stuff that he was saying and pulling out of people, like, I don't think there's any way he could have made it up.  I've never seen any of these people live.  And that's what a lot of I've heard from more than just you, Matt, that when you go see these people live and they do it.  Because they do it, they tour.  Once they get famous from TV, they tour and they perform in front of big theaters of people.  And the people who go to these places say that when you see them live, it's really amazing.  He did it to your mom? 
[03:35:30]  My mom made me go.  She was like, I'm like, what, are we going to talk to my dad who died a few years ago?  It's not going to happen.  But he made me go and I was a complete skeptic.  And when he starts the thing, he goes right off the bat and he pretty much says, I'm not going to give you closure on a dead relative.  You're not going to speak to someone you want.  It just kind of happens.  Whatever happens, happens.  And the cool thing about it, which made me get a little respect from him, is that everybody who went in there left there feeling better.  Whether you didn't get to hear anything about a relative, but I didn't get the vibe that he was fucking people for money. 
[03:36:00]  So I thought that was pretty cool.  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  When it's making people feel good, it's the same thing when we're talking about religion today.  When it's making people feel good, I don't want to go in there and be like, I have debunked this.  And now it's like all you've done is make people not feel good anymore.  So what's the point?  But was there any when you went?  Were there any questionnaires?  Was there any pre-interviewing?  Was there any or do you just go and you sit down and then it starts?  Yeah, no, we just went. 
[03:36:30]  It was the Count Basie Theater.  It's a pretty big little theater.  And sit down and, you know, he gives you rules of what you can't feed him any words, anything like that.  And basically he gets pulled to a certain area of the room.  And, you know, sometimes it's the funny thing is he'll start saying I'm hearing the word gold, the word Goldie in this section.  And the same six people will say no, no, no.  And then all of a sudden they'll go, wait, my fucking grandfather's name, nickname was Goldie.  Like weird shit.  I guess so. 
[03:37:00]  But it just seems like it seems to me that that that would be one of those things that the word Goldie in a theater full of people, somebody is going to connect to it.  Right.  Well, he would point to four to six people, random people.  And, you know, some of the names, again, some of the words he was using were not common.  They weren't John.  They weren't Jane.  I don't know.  I guess Goldie's a weird name.  But anyway, man, thanks a lot.  And have a good day.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  I know what he does for an encore.  Like, I'm going to bring your sister out, too. 
[03:37:30]  Come on.  Right.  He walks off the stage.  Everybody's cheering.  Oh, I got somebody's grandma here with me.  One more.  One more.  Hey.  I got Fido.  I got Fido.  He's with me.  My dog's name is Fido.  He says bark.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, Roland said that the Long Island broad wanted to come in and prove that she was real.  Well, doesn't Pendulet and Amazing Randy have a million dollars on the table for anyone that can prove that they are actually communicating with the dead or any paranormal activity? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, I think they do have some kind of offer.  But I don't know how you would scientifically prove that you were doing that.  I'm not sure either.  I think that's one of those things that you can ‚Äì that's also like, you know, Pendulet knows that, too.  Pendulet is a genius man, okay?  He's not going to sit there and put a million dollars on the line if he ‚Äì you know, it's something that can be proven.  That's one of those things that I think you could just prove to individuals, but you'll never be able to prove on a mass scale. 
[03:38:30]  But I just ‚Äì I watch it, and it seems to me like, you know, you start so broad, and then you just narrow in based on the information that you've been getting the whole time.  Like, it's ‚Äì  Yeah, they're great listeners.  It's a great skill to have, but I feel like it's ‚Äì it comes off to me like it's more entertainment than anything else.  And that makes me feel weird.  It rubs me the wrong way because, again, these people coming out of it, they feel good. 
[03:39:00]  But at the same time, I feel like they're being lied to.  I feel that way.  I don't know if it's a fact.  Well, because you have a room full of people who wants to really believe.  And that's the thing, and they know that.  Because they want to talk to their father, the mother, the whoever.  And sometimes it's okay if you want to believe to just be like, okay, you can believe.  But other times it's like it's not ‚Äì you know, you have to live in reality, you know?  Joe in Illinois.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, man, you mentioned this is ‚Äì it's kind of something ‚Äì some people, they don't really have a lot of ‚Äì you know, they kind of need it. 
[03:39:30]  I was a Catholic raised up and became an atheist, and here lately I've become pretty strong opinion about it.  And I'll debate people who just are debating for argument's sake.  But some people, they seem to ‚Äì  You mean you'll debate on which side?  Oh, I mean I'm an atheist.  Okay, you're an atheist now.  So you'll debate the atheism part to somebody who's like over-the-top religious. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  But some people who seem to need it.  I started to feel kind of bad exposing the ‚Äì what I consider to be utter silliness of religion.  And it's just ‚Äì breaking people's hearts is not a business I want to get into.  Right.  And I decided to kind of like draw back something ‚Äì know when to let people have what they need. 
[03:40:30]  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah, I mean I definitely know what you mean because I see the sort of pomposity of it all and the exercises and the ‚Äì you have to do this and you have to do that and you have to do it in this order and this hand signal and these words as all sort of crazy and silly.  But at the same time, if that's helping somebody, you know, grieve a loved one or get through a prison sentence or something, it's like ‚Äì why would I go out of my way to make your life more difficult?  Exactly. 
[03:41:00]  As long as it's not ‚Äì when it starts to feel like somebody's getting taken advantage of, that's when it's like, I don't like this.  That's what pisses you off.  Yeah, exactly.  But then you realize that people getting taken advantage of are happier being taken advantage of than they would be not.  So you go, well, what ‚Äì like I guess I'm not the world police.  And that's a weird place.  You know what I mean?  It's like do you want to live in reality?  And some people do or some people are complacent.  And I think a lot of people know that what they say they believe, they really kind of maybe don't, but it feels better to say that they do. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, totally.  Thanks, man.  Actually, let me go to ‚Äì real quick ‚Äì Salvatore in Albany.  Salvatore Liberace.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, I know you guys were talking about religion and spirituality, but I wanted to go back to ‚Äì about Pet Burger and radio.  Right.  Which is ‚Äì I mean, and to me, you know, we all kind of got there in one way or the other.  Absolutely.  I know you're a wrestling fan, so you probably know the name Eddie Mansfield. 
[03:42:00]  I don't.  Well, he's the wrestler who did the 2020 expose.  Oh, okay.  That basically killed Kay Fabe.  Well, back then.  Do you think that ‚Äì and for me, this is kind of true ‚Äì with Pet Burger and telling us that a lot of those phony phone calls we heard are all set up,  what you're doing is the equivalent of breaking ‚Äì what, like, Mansfield did to breaking Kay Fabe is the equivalent to what you did for, like, for radio. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, we're proving radio is fake once and for all.  It's not ‚Äì yeah, it's all a work.  I mean, it's different because with something like pro wrestling, when you say it's fake, it's like, okay, well, now we're just all in on it and we understand it.  You can't do wrestling without it being on some level staged because otherwise it's just UFC.  With radio, if you're talented and you're entertaining, you can do it without doing fake shit. 
[03:43:00]  You know what I mean?  And I think that's what it's more about.  You can do this without having to fake it and without using somebody else's work.  Understood.  Like, I didn't know ‚Äì when you guys said that those are all actors in those phony phone calls, this I didn't know.  I thought it was all a shoot.  And a lot of people ‚Äì thanks, man.  And a lot of people ‚Äì it crushes them.  But for something like that, I'm like, honestly, the radio station is just treating you like you're an idiot. 
[03:43:30]  And the one thing you've got to do is not treat your listening audience like a bunch of retards.  That's what I try to do when I broadcast is not sit there and think that I'm broadcasting to a bunch of morons because otherwise, if I can't hold the attention of somebody who's not a moron, what does that make me?  Don't answer that, Roland.  I saw you just revving up.  What's up, Brent in D.C.?  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  How you doing, man?  Good.  Yeah, the only thing ‚Äì not to debunk that outer collar, you know, he got a lot out of it. 
[03:44:00]  You guys have been hitting on that.  People get happiness out of it.  That's all well and good.  But who's to say, you know, when you go to these Edwards audiences, he doesn't have plants in the room.  There's just people ‚Äì he has stage there that he can go, you know, do readings of and give these people this false sense of well-being.  Yeah, I like hearing from people who it happened to themselves because it's true.  You never know.  It could be all legit and it could be all like I'm sensing this and it does relate to somebody. 
[03:44:30]  At the same time, theoretically, it could be a magic trick where you have an audience playing.  You know, you don't know if it's just, oh, I witnessed this happen in a room.  Yeah, exactly.  And you said something that I think that's an important thing is there's no way to scientifically prove it.  No.  I guess it's the same thing with religion.  It is.  It's the same thing as religion and faith and everything.  Like, I would like to believe that there is an energy that goes along with being a human being that doesn't exist in other things. 
[03:45:00]  There's no energy in this microphone, but there is an energy in being a human being and maybe that does exist outside of our bodies after life.  I don't know, but nobody's...  Well, there's one other thing, Rick, is the one thing about religion, I guess, is when people are doing that, they really believe in what they're saying.  But if these Edwards people, they're doing it, they might be doing it good.  They might be helping people.  They know what they're saying is a lie. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, if that's true.  Yeah, thanks, Brent.  For the most part, I think religious people are well-intentioned.  Yeah, I mean, other than pedophiles.  The people who are just lying and touching kids are the worst people in the entire universe.  But there's a difference between believing something and teaching it to somebody and lying to somebody.  I don't know if people are lying to people, but there is a difference.  Go ahead, Sal.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah, when I was in high school, me and my friends, we were all just really drunk and stoned one night. 
[03:46:00]  And we decided to go to a psychic.  And she was doing, like, the whole palm reading thing.  And she started, like, and I was just, like, I went in there thinking, like, you know, I don't believe in any of that crap.  And I just said, I'm going to play into whatever she says.  You know, and she started going on.  She's like, oh, you must work in construction.  You know, she was looking at my hands.  I'm like, yes.  How did you know that?  Now, is that the case?  Were you working in construction at the time?  No, I mean, I have callous hands, but that's from like.  That's from guitar playing.  No, yeah, from drumming.  Drumming, yeah, sure.  So I just put it on everything.  And then she said, like, I see I see a lover in your future. 
[03:46:30]  And I was like, oh, my God, he's right here with me.  Like, I mean, this whole fucking story.  And the thing is, if you give those people they are very good at rhetoric, like they have a very good sense of deductive reasoning and stuff like that.  So if you give them an ounce of information.  Yeah, they can manipulate.  And I truly believe that there are people who work as psychics and mediums and stuff like that.  I don't know anyone specific, but I believe that part of that practice is that they lie to themselves to the point that they convince themselves of this reality. 
[03:47:00]  Like they don't realize that all they're doing is, like you said, deductive reasoning.  They believe that them being good listeners is actually some otherworldly power.  And when they're always like, oh, I get a sense.  Well, yes, everyone gets a fucking sense when you're having a conversation.  You have an idea.  Yeah, it's called picking up on somebody's vibe.  Yeah, Montel Williams used Sylvia Brown.  He believes in her.  He does.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't she get debunked?  Did she?  I don't know for sure.  I don't want to say she did. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, because I know when Montel had MS, like he used her all the time.  Well, I mean, if it helped Montel and his MS, I think the weed probably helped him more than anything.  But if that helped him, then so be it.  Maybe he was highly.  Well, shit, that does make sense.  But if I was a psychic and Sal walked into my room, there's no fucking way I would say you must work in construction.  You're the least you must work in construction guy I've seen since I looked at myself.  I know.  I guess because, you know, she was just trying to pick up on subtle things, you know. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, but she's got to figure out that instruments that you use your hands on leave calluses, too, because you don't look.  I'm sorry, Sal.  I know.  You don't look like you work in construction.  I know.  And that was the beauty of it.  It's just kind of fun.  Like, I definitely recommend it.  His dad hooked him up with the job?  Where he's, like, overseas and he gets, like, paper cuts from unrolling it.  You like that?  Just testing him, Sal.  Yeah.  It's honestly, like, for whatever it is, 15 bucks or whatever, it's kind of fun just to go in there and watch them actually create this story.  Yeah, but wouldn't they know how much it would make that day since they could sense it when they opened? 
[03:48:30]  Like how successful the day is going to be?  Ah, today I'll make $100, yes.  Well, that's the other thing, too.  Yeah, it's not worth opening today.  I'm only going to make $40.  If you have this innate, you know, talent, why are you charging people, you know?  Well, you got to make a dollar.  You got it, right?  You know what I'm saying?  You got to get that paper.  Yeah.  You know what?  Trinidad James has a God-given gift of rhyme, okay?  He is a wordsmith above all else.  But he's also got to make that paper.  So he's got to sell his wraps.  How else is he going to afford golden shopping carts? 
[03:49:00]  I know.  I completely agree with you.  I'm going to get a psychic in for Denny.  Yeah.  I think we could all predict how that one's going to happen.  The psychic would just sit there and go, I'm sorry.  Shut up.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  So much information he gives him.  I don't have your name, but Ohio.  Sam?  Yeah, buddy.  How are you doing today, sir?  Good.  How are you doing?  Great.  I just kind of jumped in the middle.  You were talking about religion a little bit.  Sure.  I was never a big religious guy.  I went to church, obviously, like Christmas, whatnot, the usual stuff to do with the family. 
[03:49:30]  And two years ago, on April Fool's Day, I was involved in a car accident where I had what's called a C1 hangman's break.  What's that?  My head literally fell off of my shoulders.  Jesus Christ.  Your neck broke that much?  Yeah, you asked Dr. Steve about it.  It's probably one of the worst breaks a guy can have.  Christopher Reeve's break was very similar to what I had.  So when you come to, are you laying down? 
[03:50:00]  And the idea is that they somehow have to transport your head and body without ‚Äì it's just kind of flesh.  It's like the ‚Äì what's his name?  The Theismann injury on your leg except on your neck?  Actually, it's a very good description, Sam.  Excellent description.  Yeah, it ‚Äì the only reason why I lived in ‚Äì I never came to in the car.  I had an experience in the car but never came to.  The only reason why I lived was my neighbor happened to hear the wreck and was getting up to go to work also and put my head ‚Äì 
[03:50:30]  he literally had to put my head back on my shoulders to open my airway up.  Wow.  I was suffocating to death.  And I was paralyzed.  I couldn't move.  But while in the car, the only thing I remember about the whole wreck is I could see myself.  I was looking ‚Äì I was on the outside looking at myself.  And I thought that it was the most amazing thing because it was the most peaceful place I'd ever been.  Did you see yourself accurately?  Yes.  Like you saw ‚Äì go ahead.  I seen my head in my lap. 
[03:51:00]  And I knew something was wrong.  And I knew that I was spending the last few minutes with myself before I was going to wherever I was going to go.  Now, where I was going to go, to be just quite honest, I don't know where it was.  I just know where I was at.  There was something.  It was the coolest place I'd ever been.  There was no stress.  And I remember while I was looking at myself, I was thinking of my grandpa because I used to live with my grandpa.  And he was a very religious person. 
[03:51:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  Well, right before you got in that car, you do a little PCP, a little angel dust?  Was that what we're talking about?  That's a negative ghostwriter.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's something you got to get on the table because if it turns out you're on angel dust, then I got a very logical explanation for you.  Or the Molly.  Or the Molly.  It was absolutely nothing.  I just woke up to go to work on April Fool's Day.  People say the reactions like that are the chemicals that your brain releases. 
[03:52:00]  But I start to think that's just ‚Äì now that's just the science side of people trying to debunk the other side.  My problem is whenever I tell my story, I don't ‚Äì I read a book, A Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, because I talked to a preacher once about what I went through.  And naturally, he wanted it to be something that it wasn't.  He wanted me to tell him there was lights, there was this, that, you know, everything you read in a book.  So I read that book.  And what that kid went through, he had the same injury kind of but is paralyzed. 
[03:52:30]  And by the way, to this day, I work and pay my own way.  You're not paralyzed?  No.  I was supposed to be somehow.  All but for the grace of God.  All right, buddy.  All but ‚Äì all right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  I got to communicate.  I'll tell you later who it's from.  Yeah, you were just ‚Äì  It says ‚Äì  I thought you were about to go to heaven with that noise you just made while he was on the phone.  It says, Sam is full of shit.  How many times has he gone down on his knees with a cross and rosary, knees praying for a hole called going to take down Macho Man Radio Savage? 
[03:53:00]  Who's that, Kenny?  No, somebody else.  Who was it?  Tell me who it was.  Yo.  Look, we all have religious moments.  And when the Macho Man Randy Savage is up against the greatest challenge of all, we do turn to God.  You son of a bitch.  He just debunked you.  I've never prayed for the results of a professional wrestling contest.  He said, please, just one more. 
[03:53:30]  One more win.  Pete in Virginia.  Good morning, Sam.  The reason I'm calling is about psychics.  If you go on YouTube and type in Sylvia Brown, she tells Amanda Barry's family that she is dead.  That's right.  And we all know what happened when Charles Ramsey pulled her out of the house in Cleveland.  So right then and there, there's evidence that these psychics are none but a fraud.  Well, thanks, dude.  There's evidence that she was definitely wrong about that one thing, but that's what it was. 
[03:54:00]  Sylvia Brown said that this girl was dead, you know, Amanda Barry.  Yeah.  And then she wasn't.  Like she sat there telling her family, yes, she's dead, but she's at peace and dah, dah, dah.  And the family's crying, but they're getting, the girl wasn't even dead.  But when she said, but then she said like the coldness was maybe because she was cold, but she took that for death.  Right.  Well, that's what you, like you can't sit there and say you're fraudulent because there's no scientific way to say that.  Yeah.  But that's some of that broad spectrum stuff that it's like, okay.  Like when Macho Man hits Hulk Hogan with his chair, you're like. 
[03:54:30]  I don't know what you're talking about with Macho Man and Hulk Hogan.  You can take that theory and shove it directly up your ass.  All right, brother man.  Mark in Oceanside.  Hey guys, how you doing?  Good.  Did you ever hear of a guy named Jeffrey Wands?  No.  All right.  He's from Glen Cove.  He's pretty popular.  I mean, John Edwards is the one that really put everything on the map, you know, going back 15, 20 years ago.  I tend to have an open mind about things.  I try not to be too much of a skeptic, but I'm also not easily fooled. 
[03:55:00]  But my father died back in 2001.  And like a month later, my brother decided to go, this is Jeffrey Wands.  He's up in Glen Cove.  So, this guy's a little different.  I kind of tend to say this guy's a little more factual only because he doesn't ask you questions.  You were really spot on for when you talk about him.  That's good.  Well, your phone's starting to break up a little bit.  We'll look up Jeffrey Wands.  You're saying he's the real deal.  I don't know.  Taz.  Taz on Long Island.  Yeah, hi. 
[03:55:30]  You don't sound like Taz, the human suplex machine.  We went to a second class, my wife and I.  And it was Jeffrey Wands who was the...  Can you say this?  Can you say my hands are my weapons?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Yeah, no.  That doesn't sound like the Taz that I know.  Can you say this?  Can you say this?  Can you say just another victim?  Just another victim.  That's not Taz.  But go on.  That's not.  I mean, it's not.  But go on.  Were you...  How many times did you hold a hardcore championship? 
[03:56:00]  A long one?  Okay, yeah.  That's not Taz.  But go on.  Go on with what you were saying.  Okay.  So anyway, my wife and I went out to dinner.  And then we went to this class that Jeffrey Wands was holding for.  Real quick, Taz.  What are your favorite colors?  Anyway, Jeffrey knew things about my mother-in-law's death.  He didn't die by natural cause.  And he gave us...  She said orange black.  The afterwards we went back and checked.  And he was right.  How did he do that? 
[03:56:30]  I don't know.  I don't know, Taz.  If that's your real name.  If that's your real name.  As far as I can see.  What's your favorite Tazplex?  My favorite what?  Yeah, I don't think there's really Taz.  I'll talk to you later.  He's like, she'll be the Browns people.  Because I asked him what his favorite colors were.  The real Taz would have said orange and black in a heartbeat.  Yeah.  And then he goes, what bell?  They're like, what?  He didn't even know about the hardcore championship?  Like, come on.  I played PS3.  What's up with that?  You should know, too.  Matt in Pennsylvania. 
[03:57:00]  Sam, what's that?  How you doing, buddy?  Hey, listen.  I used to work for a family company.  And the patriarch of the family was a very, very religious man.  Was it the Entenmann's family?  No, it wasn't.  That would be delicious.  That would have been delicious.  And that probably would make sense because I'm fat.  But anyway, he was a really great guy.  His children that picked up the company when he decided to step away, they were all very religious as well, probably because of his influence in their upbringing. 
[03:57:30]  They were the worst people ever, ever.  They were backbiting.  They were liars.  And because they went to church every Sunday, they thought that that made everything else okay.  Yeah, that's horrible.  Like, that's when you're just looking for excuses to be a bad human being.  Like, there's no way that if being religious and going to church helps you become a better person, then that's something you should do. 
[03:58:00]  But if it's an excuse to allow you to be a horrible human being, which it is for a lot of people, go fuck yourself.  Yeah, don't say fad.  We're called huskies.  I totally agree.  I couldn't agree more.  It's very upsetting.  Yeah, thanks, Matt.  Yeah, and you do see that a lot.  It's like the whole religious thing.  And you probably saw that a lot with the child sex scandals, that these priests that were touching kids thought that, oh, I'm a priest, so I can do no wrong.  Yeah, I did this.  That was bad.  But don't worry. 
[03:58:30]  I'm repenting.  It's like in the 2020s, they're like, God forgave me.  And God's up there, like, going, shut up.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, I did not.  I did not.  Asshole, give me a bad name.  Then God was up there going, cut the cameras.  Which studio is it?  He's like, Jesus, help me.  Which building?  Can I cut the power off?  I didn't tell this asshole I forgave him.  No.  Juan on the Jersey Shore.  How you doing?  Good.  Just a few minutes ago, I heard you use the word retard and moron to describe people.  You know that's going to upset Fez. 
[03:59:00]  And I'm going to have to listen to four hours of angry Fez or crying Fez.  Well, you know me.  Juan, I have one motivation here, and it's to bully Fez.  That's the only reason that I do radio to begin with.  And, quite frankly, my only skill, as far as broadcasting goes, is bullying people and pointing out others' flaws.  So, what else do I have?  Wait, Sam.  Jesus forgives you, so Fez can't get mad.  Thank you, Juan.  Huh?  Jesus just forgave you.  Fez, can I get mad?  Did you get that on the text?  Yep. 
[03:59:30]  Nice.  So, Fez can't yell at you today.  We could talk about this all day.  I was also going to talk about football.  Maybe we're talking about football tomorrow.  I got your tweet, you fucking smart aleck.  I was trying to promote my Sunday show, and you're telling people, nobody's listening.  Football's on.  The 49ers are on.  Dude, that was a great game.  I got to tell you something.  I'm watching football this season.  I don't know if it's my OCD or whatever, but I can't stop watching the Giants lose.  I know.  Cannot stop.  The Cowboys almost won.  That was a good game.  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  We'll get into all that tomorrow, okay?  We could talk about this psychic stuff all day, if you believe, if you don't believe.  I don't care.  Ron and Fez, they care.  They're coming up next, so stay tuned, and we'll be back with more of this, and hopefully  an EROC update tomorrow, maybe.  What do you think, Sal?  Are we going to get one?  I hope so.  Yeah, we didn't get one today.  I don't know.  That remains to be seen.  We'll find out when this world continues tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
