<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast from a Washington D.C. XM studio, opened with the hosts declaring themselves "shock jocks" and rejecting the idea of "nice" radio. Initial technical difficulties with audio and cameras were quickly overcome, but the hosts then discussed a serious rat infestation at the XM building, recounting staff anecdotes about oversized rats stealing pizza and escaping traps.

Anthony detailed his chaotic journey to the studio: two flat tires (on the same tire!) on his Escalade, requiring a comical tire change and an over-the-top reaction from the OnStar operator; his girlfriend's gallbladder surgery and delayed hospital discharge; and a difficult quest to obtain Delauden medication for her, involving multiple pharmacies and a hospital supplier in Queens.

The show featured "FU Friday," "Point and Laugh Friday," and "Mispronunciation Friday" segments.  A lengthy call from Tom, a listener with a severe lung disease previously contemplating suicide, dominated a section.  He updated his status (still alive) and engaged in a sometimes insensitive but lighthearted conversation with the hosts about his health and wishes, ultimately negotiating a Macbook Pro in exchange for a future show appearance.  Opie’s anxiety about his nephew and fraternity brothers throwing a party in his Manhattan apartment was a recurring theme, punctuated by threats to kill his nephew. The hosts also previewed E-Rock spanking a stripper (audio to play later) and discussed Jenna Bush's engagement, including humorous "do's and don'ts" for the groom from a newspaper.

The show continued with the hosts reading humorous, insulting advice for a newlywed couple from a listener. This transitioned to a segment featuring E-Rock spanking Penthouse Pet Justine Jolie, in-studio. The spanking went badly, resulting in a loud yelp of pain that the hosts replayed repeatedly.  A phone call with a regretful (but mostly disgusted) E-Rock followed; he detailed his aversion to feet after being forced to lick mayonnaise off Jolie's feet, resulting in vomiting.  His relationship troubles and diet were also discussed.

The hosts then reviewed *Super Bad*, discussed a gouge on the space shuttle Endeavour, Michael Vick’s potential guilty plea, and played an audio clip of a drunk flight attendant's arrest.  A shocking story about Stanley Reimer throwing his ailing wife from a balcony due to medical bills was shared, along with a news story about the Pentagon's exorbitant spending on shipping cheap washers to Iraq.  A call from a surprisingly knowledgeable and nervous 14-year-old, Andrew from Brooklyn, who shared space shuttle facts, provided further amusement.

A segment featuring Andrew's space shuttle "fun facts" continued, followed by a crude exchange with Kelly from Long Island complaining about the overuse of "uber."  A news report about German physicists breaking the speed of light led to humorous speculation and ridicule.  Discussions of scams, including selling a VCR box filled with newspapers and repackaged oven doors as plasma TVs, were interspersed with outtakes from a recording session with "Master Poe," promoting a fitness program called "body rock."  The hosts played several clips, mocking his delivery and discovering he was unaware of the recording during a live phone call; a side conversation on the meaning of "us" followed. The segment concluded with promotional information for a live show.

The show included another "Master Poe" bit, referencing Chris Benoit (acknowledged as potentially insensitive), and an explanation of "pwned" with vulgar examples.  A "Car Crash Comedy" segment featured ten comedians (Rob Stats Manzatti, Adam Nystrom, Brian Jett, Anthony Taylor, Jim Pate, Haywood Turnipseed Jr., and others), using shock value and offensive material.  The hosts used a hand signal to end sets, and a running gag involved a missing audience member and rats.  Sam, a regular guest, discussed his diet.  Anonymous audience confessions, often sexually explicit, concluded the segment, followed by the announcement of Seton Smith as the Car Crash Comedy winner by Don Wicklund.

A "fantasy" segment featured sexually explicit caller anecdotes. Callers described various sexual encounters and fantasies, including a threesome, a crack-addicted prostitute whose hair caught fire during anal sex, a childhood encounter involving a Star Wars poster, defecating on a rug, and performing oral sex on a dog. A caller requested a "butt rub" with producer Jimmy, which occurred on-air. The show concluded with a mention of upcoming live shows, including free admission for military personnel, a transition to Ron and Fez, and a reminder that the broadcast originated from Washington D.C.

[00:01:00]  can you pop this  aim it over there  this is the worst  the worst show I've  this is the worst show I've ever been on  but enough of this palaver  let's get the show on the road  that hurt a bit 
[00:01:30]  alright they turned the mics on  I was about to say is this gonna work  and it wasn't working  I got me  Jimmy say something  sounds a little weird because we're not at our home base  no? no  sounds really bad  no not bad just different you get used to it though  alright good morning welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  what? the ONA virus  is it really loud in your headphones?  no the music was just a little  that's better  we are live from Washington D.C. 
[00:02:00]  yes  at the XM compound  where the rats live  and the security guards everywhere  yeah man  very uh  very uh  like uh  it's like a military base  well our driver  we were in this van this morning from the hotel  you know taking the  taking the scenic ride through the ghetto  to get here  yep  lovely  we forgot about that part of the whole thing  you go right through the ghetto  in the middle of the night 
[00:02:30]  that's always fun  and safe  and then the driver goes  oh you're going there  that's where the rats are  the rats  apparently there's a rat problem here  or was  I have no idea  I saw the traps outside  it was kind of fun  well if you see traps outside  then uh  they still have a rat problem  what kind of audio am I  uh  what what  what what  what what  what what  what's going on  I think we're hearing the Endeavor  oh no that's cool  okay it's PalTalk  let me just lower this  all right  I'll lower this for me 
[00:03:00]  because I don't want to hear it  I'm doing it  okay  because uh  I can't get uh  audio  on uh  for the PalTalk people  so I asked somebody else  could you stream that please  and they're doing it  they're nice  so we got PalTalk cameras in here too  yeah  yeah it's just facing uh  Sam right now  Sam you're the PalTalk star of the day  yeah  all right we're still fiddling around here  but uh  fiddling  so no you saw the rat traps outside  so that means there's still a rat problem  yeah  I would gather 
[00:03:30]  so if there's traps outside  there's probably a problem  what do they look  what do they look like  uh  well  big nasty rats  Eric Logan at dinner last night  was telling us that they're  the size of small cats  or Don was saying  the size of small cats  and look  everyone down here in Washington  thumbs up  shaking their heads  up and down  like yep  you got that right  we've seen him  Eric Logan was saying  who's uh  who's Eric Logan  we finally  I  we finally saw him  for the first time  did you say him  he really exists  yeah  wow 
[00:04:00]  but he was talking about  the rat problem  and he's like uh  at night  you know the jocks and stuff  that are still  down here at the compound  you know they order pizza and stuff  and they eat what they  you know can  and they leave the rest  kind of in the garbage  and then in the morning  when everyone else comes to work  they see the garbage pails  completely you know  pushed over  and the pizza gone  so the the rats are dragging  you know whole slices of pizza  back to the rat's uh  rat's nest  they mostly come out at night  mostly  mostly  he said the traps 
[00:04:30]  they had to wire down  because the rats  will get the traps  stuck on their head  and then run away with them  that's how big they are  they had to wire the traps down  so the rats  didn't make off  run away with the traps  the traps were coming down  on their heads  and they're like  ah  and they would just  they would just run away  with the the traps  I'll go back  a couple of my boys  will help me get this  off my head  yeah they'll just  gnaw the trap  off my head  and I'm on my way again  so they  yeah they had to go  under the floor  and actually wire down  these these traps  damn  there's a rat problem  XM is building them 
[00:05:00]  hats  alright we are live  from DC  we're gonna be  we're gonna be doing  all sorts of things  while we're down here  we're doing uh  you know the first half  of the show  in this little studio  then we're heading over  to a huge studio  to do it in front of  a live audience  for XM later on  this morning  oh live audience  and then we got  the ONA traveling virus  tomorrow night  in Virginia  at the Nissan Pavilion  tickets still available  for that  ticket sales  have been great  the last few days  man  and they're still available  it's gonna be  an all day event  of course  gonna be a biggie  and I wanna say 
[00:05:30]  what's up to Anthony  my pal  hi  Anthony's adventure  continues  this adventure  started I believe  early Sunday morning  yeah I think  it's finally  like  in perspective  now  it's gonna settle down  yeah I think  I might finally  I might get some sleep  at some point  I apologize  for laughing openly  at you yesterday  I think it made  our promo  for our New York  station  but right after  the show  Anthony gets  a text  from Master Po 
[00:06:00]  and Master Po  is informing Anthony  that he's got a  flat tire  this is all I needed  on his brand new  Escalade  flat tire  that's the least  of his worries  or the last thing  you need it  by the way  what really  it's the second flat  same tire  I think that goofball  that fixed it  didn't do a good job  yeah  but  so I'm texting Po  and I'm like  cause last time  I got the flat  it wasn't that bad  it's like  you're low on air  and you could tell  but I could get home  to get it fixed  and 
[00:06:30]  he comes pulling  around the corner  and I'm looking  at the wheel  and I'm texting him  I go  is there enough air  for me to get home  he goes  I don't think so  so I look at the tire  it is  more flatter  than any flat tire  I've ever seen  flat in my life  there was no air in it  the rim was flat  it was that flat  so for him to say  I don't think so  you know  he's  I don't think so  let's be honest  he's kind of stupid  he's a stupid man  but he could  kill you with a toothpick  I get it 
[00:07:00]  he's a killer  trained killer  but I started openly laughing  on the sidewalk  I'm sorry  but I'm really into that  that dark humor  I'm like  this is the last thing  this guy needed  oh you saw the flat  oh my god  and I start laughing  and then I'm like  oh dude  I'm really sorry  I know you're going  through hell this week  I had to get out of there  but that's funny  it's like Murphy's Law  is happening to Anthony  yeah  my chick was in the hospital  getting her gallbladder  taken out  yeah  and then  you know  I gotta get out of there  and you haven't slept in days  I haven't slept in days 
[00:07:30]  all you wanted  was to jump in your car  and get the hell out of the city  get the hell out of here  because I had to get her out of the hospital  so we can get here  right  that was the problem  you guys were already on your way here  and I still had to go out to Long Island  pick her up from the hospital  and start my journey  right  so the first thing that happens  is Poe comes pulling up  with the flat tire  so I'm like  oh Jesus Christ  so Kenny's there  and Poe is there  and they're nice enough  to begin the procedure  of changing  my flat tire  well the best part  was Master Poe 
[00:08:00]  trying to parallel park  in your brand new  that's how it started  pretty much hitting a delivery truck  or the ramp of a delivery truck  going over like chains  he had no idea  what was going on  he was going up on the curb  then he finally gets it  in a spot  right in a huge puddle  of dirty New York City water  gutter water  gutter water  and  I'm laughing even harder  because I'm like  we gotta change this tire  or somebody has to  how are you gonna change a tire  that's halfway  in this mucky water 
[00:08:30]  you gotta give the guy credit  he laid down  right in that  muck gutter water  and did what  he had to do  did he?  yeah  I called up  you know  I called up  the people  you know  on star  how may we help you  yeah I got a flat tire  oh are you okay  are you on the side of the road  are you in danger  is there a problem  cut the questions  don't make everything I say  sound like the airbags  went off  and there's dead children  everywhere  it's a flat tire 
[00:09:00]  Jesus  the on star people  are panicking peats  they should be able  to fix your flat tire  through the satellite  yeah they should be able to  you know how they can  like unlock your doors  unlock the doors  everything  how great would that be  why is Kenny laughing  I'm still talking  through the microphone  like I'm talking  because I'm still talking  to on star  alright I'm sorry  go ahead  and I was like  yeah  well I gotta get  I gotta get  my tire fixed  okay we'll  we'll get that word out  and have somebody  contact you  yeah  so I'm waiting 
[00:09:30]  and about 15 minutes later  I get a call  this is the automated  on star service  call center  you have  a service  it should arrive  in  two hours  oh  god  so these guys  are going at it  with the flat tire  first of all  just getting  remember when you  used to just  pop the trunk  get your stupid 
[00:10:00]  chick-tung  chick-tung  chick-tung  chick-tung  jack out  and the spare  was right in your trunk  and you pulled  everything out  and it was  it was like  it was no problem  right  now the new vehicles  have like  everything is put  in this place  and screwed down  and it's like a puzzle  it's like a puzzle  to get everything out  and the jack handle  is shoved into the  side well  of the rear compartment  the spare tire's up  underneath the bottom  and has to be brought down  with a cable 
[00:10:30]  and a little winch thing  and watching Poe do this  trying to put the little  rods together  to make the handle  longer  to stick in the hole  that brings the thing down  and he had it  kind of backwards  and sideways  and the guy's  full of heart  but I gotta tell you  it was a little rough  and you lowered  the spare tire down  and it's got one  of those things  through the middle hole  of the spare tire  where it's  the shape that it has  holds it in  but you gotta give it  some slack  turn it sideways 
[00:11:00]  and then bring it  through the hole  picture an old episode  of what we were talking  about the other day  the three stooges  what used to happen  when they'd have to get  a two by four  in a doorway  and they're holding  it lengthwise  and they would cut  big holes in the doorway  that was Poe  trying to get  the spare tire off  oh my god  so and he's laying  in the mud  we got pictures of it  and the dirt  but he got it done  and the one thing 
[00:11:30]  that got me though  is he hand tightened  the lugs  and then was ready  to jack the car down  to tighten  then tighten the lugs up  he's a strong fellow  but I'm like  you know  everything I've ever done  when I change a tire  you tighten it as much  as you can  while it's still jacked up  without moving the jack  then you lower it down  and then you give it  the good point  so you don't have  a wobbly wheel  oh you would have  the most wobbly wheel  wobbly wheel  I don't want wobbly wheel  but that was just 
[00:12:00]  the beginning  of a day  that was just  long  and full of crap  should we start the music  more slow motion  hospital stuff  why not  let's start the music  for Anthony's adventure  this is what happened  to Anthony yesterday  the car pulling up  and I have a flat tire  I got a flat tire  Poe comes out  he lays in the gutter  in the dirt  and changes the flat tire  I finally get the flat tire changed  now I'm late  to get to the hospital  pick up my girlfriend  who just had her gallbladder out 
[00:12:30]  and she's supposed  to be discharged  any minute  actually I had to drive  back to the hospital  on Long Island  to pick up my girlfriend  from the hospital  or else I'm not going  to make it to D.C.  I got to be here  for a broadcast  I hop in the escalade  with the spare tire  drive all the way home first  because now I'm full of grease  from the spare tire  I got to wash up  before I go to the hospital  I meet Keith the cop there  at my house  we both go to the hospital  because I had a couple of beers  to calm myself down  we go to the hospital  I go to get my chick  out of the hospital  she's still in the hospital bed 
[00:13:00]  in her gown  I go what's going on  she goes they haven't  discharged me yet  so I go to the front nurse  and I go what's the deal  when is she getting discharged  she goes let me speak  to the nurse  I go back to the room  the nurse comes in  she goes I have the papers  right here  they've been sitting here  why haven't you given me  the papers  they never even looked  she could have been out  an hour earlier  but what the hell  she's got  I got her papers  we get her out  we go to the car  bring her home  now we got a book of flight  Keith is yelling  into the phone  at one of the shuttle places  that take her  from New York to Washington  to get us a plane  in the meantime 
[00:13:30]  I'm running out  to try to find  my girlfriend  Delauden  a medicine  that is probably  harder to get  than black tar heroin  I went to eight  different pharmacies  they didn't have it  they don't store it  they don't stock it  it's stronger than morphine  and that's the same drug  your mom was on  my mother took it once  Sal took it once  when my mother took it  she went crazy  and thought she was  in a casino  with men trying to  have sex with her  and Sal thought  he was in the navy again  and Delauden  is very hard to get  so I drove all over  the place  finally had to go back 
[00:14:00]  to the hospital  that I just discharged her  from  and asked  where can I get this stuff  can I get it here  no we don't dispense drugs  but we know a place  in Queens  so I had to get back  in my Escalade  with the flat tire  that boat changed  and drive all the way  to Queens  to get to Delauden  two hours later  I'm back to the house  Keith is still screaming  into the phone  trying to get our  airline reservations  we finally get  the airline reservations  and he books a car  the car pulls up  at about 8.15  and we're still packing  pack the car  pack the bags  pack the car 
[00:14:30]  and we're off  to the airport  we get to the airport  check in  relatively easy  Melinda did not  flush the Delauden  down the toilet  because the cops  were coming  we needed that Delauden  they would have  found it  we get on the shuttle  we're on the shuttle  it's a 42 minute flight  not bad at all  we land  we get to the hotel  we're starving  we order room service  by the time we finish  room service  it's well after 12.30 
[00:15:00]  the alarm goes off  two seconds later  it's time to get up  and come here  I get in the van  rush  come here  and here we are  sitting here now  Jesus  that was a  action packed day  no kidding  action packed  and you can't find  this stuff  Dwayne Reed  Delauden  no Dwayne Reed  every store  all of those stores  they go  no we don't have this  no why  they want to make it  perfectly clear  they don't have that stuff 
[00:15:30]  because they don't want  to be broken into  stronger than morphine  well people would break  into a Dwayne Reed  that carries that  to get it  yeah  right  so they'd rather  not carry it  I had to go to some  drug store that deals  with hospitals  they supply the hospitals  with their drugs  did you have to wait  online for it  when you got there  no actually it was  pretty cool  because I walked  into the place  and I saw  a guy in there  talking to a woman  behind the counter  and the guy  gave me

[00:24:00]  to my pad  I will kill you  I'm not your mother  I'm not your father  where you can just lie to my face  I'm looking in your eyes  don't tell me  you're not gonna have a party  and then you have a party  if you have a party  I will kill you  blah blah blah blah  kill you  blah blah blah blah  blah can't wait till he leaves  blah blah blah  believe me  kill you  as you were getting in the car  people were walking in  yep  that's how it works  that's how it used to work with me  dude I live across  you don't think I don't know  I was getting in a cab  I was so depressed  you know 
[00:24:30]  driving down to Penn Station  last night  I live across the street from Hope  if you let me have your apartment  I'd have a party in it  of course  I would just invite my girlfriend  and tell her  bring your grandmother  we're gonna ransack this joint  and it's not like  you know  it's not like  they drink or anything  they showed up Wednesday night  and trust me  had nothing to do with it  they come walking through  that really nice lobby  with all the  with all the  door people and stuff  carrying  like shopping bags  just filled  with 16 ounces  16 ounce beers 
[00:25:00]  as many as they could  like you know  find  three frat guys  in Manhattan  if they don't have a party  there's something wrong  with them  yeah there's something wrong  you're right  dude didn't you see  Risky Business  I did see Risky Business  his parents told him  oh great thanks  thanks for the music  Danny you asked  that's exactly  what's gonna happen  hey how you doing  yeah come on in  come on over  dude it's great  it's a Manhattan apartment  yeah  no crap  yeah  dude

[00:26:00]  tangerine dream  while you're at it  try not to break  let's try not to break  the crystal egg  Opie will notice  yeah like I have  a crystal egg  in my place  yeah I might finally  have a crystal egg  I might finally have  a nice place to live  but I still have  nothing in it  of value  thank god  how bad do you  not want that call  Mr. Hughes  hi  this is the building  oh  it won't be  they're behaving  better that than I  Mr. Hughes  this is the police  yeah  so they carry in  there's a dead hooker 
[00:26:30]  in your apartment  they carry in  there's 16  ounces right  like two bags  each  there's three of them  I was amazed  how much beer  they were able  to scrounge out  up  because they don't  even have fake  IDs these dopes  these dopes  don't even have  fake IDs man  I had a fake  ID at 16  and so they  came to the show  yesterday  I go to bed  around 930  the night before  they crash at 11  so they've been  in my apartment  two hours before  they crash  and then they 
[00:27:00]  get up for the show  when I woke up  at 430  I was curious  I looked to see  how many of these  16 ounce beers  they polished off  in two hours  18  well I'm sure  somebody of age  probably came over  and drank them  look I had  nothing to do with it  18  16 ounces  that's while you were there  while I was there  what do you think  they just wanted to  get out of their systems  before you left  in the first two hours  of being in my  really nice place 
[00:27:30]  guys let's paint  one of his rooms  that'll be good  let's do something  nice for Greg  and my nephew  just smiling at me  at the door  like don't  you have nothing  to worry about  they come wheeling in  with their luggage  on the hardwood floors  I'm like  I finally have  something nice  I want to keep it  for a while  I can't wait  to look up  in the news  and see your building  with flames  coming out  of your window  oops  the amazing thing  is they're going  to try to be good  they go  it's my uncle's place 
[00:28:00]  and then they're going  to look around  they're going to look  at the view  this is New York  we have this place  he's gone  there's three guys  this sucks  we have to get chicks  up here  and we don't have  the kind of job  where they can go  but we don't know  if he's going to  just show up  as long as your voice  is coming out  of that radio  you ain't showing up  you ain't popping in  on him  and Jason  if you think  you're on to me  how do you know  this is life  how do you know  this is life  oh he knows  how about this Jason 
[00:28:30]  if you hear Jim Brewer  start talking  pack the place up  and get everybody out  skedaddle  you went old school  very good Jimmy  and uh  well my chick  she booby trapped  the place though  oh yeah  yeah  I mean if anyone  touches my bed  I swear to god  dude that  by the way  is the  that's the goal  what  to have sex  to have sex  in my bed  on Opie  from the Opie  and Anthony  show's bed  that's like 
[00:29:00]  dude  I'm doing it  I'm gonna have  sex with the  with my chick  over here  you know  and there'll be  girls  hey  big party  going on  right  right  right  who wants  to have sex  on Opie's bed  yeah  well there you go  three frat guys  in my apartment  while we're down here  working our asses off  oh that's great  trying to make a living  I would have paid  for three hotel rooms  and just  I know it's crazy  or a big hotel room  cheaper than  what you're gonna have  to go through  than the worry  I would just say  no you know what guys  I wanna hook you up 
[00:29:30]  my place is then fixing it  hey you know  I'm gonna get you guys  a hotel room  your nice new mattress  that you got  it's gonna look like  people spilled lactate  on it  oh you got a new mattress  I got  oh  the new sound system  is all hooked up  too right  oh shut up  Jimmy  you know how nice  that would sound  three guys just dancing  nah three guys dancing  is not fun  three guys  that's what happens  three guys are gonna be in there  blasting your new sound system  that goes all over  the whole place  and they're gonna be  dancing with each other  going this is great  we don't need girls  or a party  or other guys 
[00:30:00]  or beers  or anything like that  we could have fun  just the three of us  in this beautiful  apartment  in Manhattan  yeah well  they're gonna have to  show somebody  I would have to  show somebody  I understand  I've seen this play  I would have to  show somebody  you gotta come up  I'm not happy about it  and then the night  before my sister  came over  with her  two small kids  and her husband  and the kids  are running  all around the apartment  which was cool  they go into  one of the rooms  and they start  looking into the 
[00:30:30]  building next to me  and I'm like  in the living room  and all I hear  is my niece  who's only seven  yelling and screaming  oh my god  they're naked  JD they're naked  staring into  Jimmy's window  calling over  her nine-year-old  brother  so the seven-year-old  niece who's just  gonna be a problem  child  she's beautiful  with an attitude  is calling JD over  and now they're  looking out my window  into the building  next door  watching little kids 
[00:31:00]  taking a bath  so that's like  that has to be  porno for a seven  and nine-year-old  right there  has to be  even though it was  an innocent bath  with mommy  what apartment  would I take  in the bathroom  gotta keep them  clean  you're dirty  you're gonna wash  dirty  you disgust me  and you think  and you think  like the  you know  the father would be  running after the kids  like to go  maybe this isn't  a good idea  he goes running 
[00:31:30]  in there laughing  his ass off  and he joins  my niece  and nephew  watching this  mom bathe two kids  and my sister's  rolling her eyes  you know Holly  she's like the sweetest  most innocent thing ever  yeah  she doesn't  you know  approve of any  of that crap  right  and then all of a sudden  they come back  in the living room  and then they're  running back  into the room  to see if they  can see anything  else in the windows  and they're  talking about  some mom  making dinner  and then there's  a doggy  and then all of a sudden  Jamie goes 
[00:32:00]  oh my god  now the mommy's naked  and then of course  my brother-in-law  who's married  my sister  goes darting  sprinting  sprinting as fast  as he could  to go check out  mommy naked  with his own kids  Jesus  so it's just been  a circus  in my place  the last two days  they will party  in there  well you could have  probably prevented that  by the way  which part  them partying up there  how  when you went  to the doorman  because the doormen  are pretty good  they make sure 
[00:32:30]  like nothing crazy  you should have  left names  and said only these  three are allowed  up to that apartment  every time they go up  make sure  it's only them three  I kind of told  Jason  if they're not  on the list  they're not allowed  up  it's probably  Pedro  but I don't  think he  believed me  he's  look he's  pretty mad  he's a smart  boy  yeah  so and then  I was gonna  like buy beer  for these guys  and I'm like  what am I  doing  what do you  get  just buy  dynamite  well I felt  bad they didn't  have fake IDs  so I was gonna 
[00:33:00]  buy a few cases  but I you know  right after the show  yesterday you know  me I'm not packed  and I have 45 minutes  to get to the train  so I came home  to pack  I'm like you guys  sorry can't buy  you beer  which hopefully  will like you know  keep things under  control  no  I'm thinking  no  that kids  they like Starbucks  they'll have a few  lattes  that's it  they don't like  drinking partying  getting girls over  the place  how impressive  would that be  let me tell you  something  let me just tell you  something  how impressive  to a girl 
[00:33:30]  would it be  to go look  I got  I got a great  place here  in Manhattan  it's way up  way up in the  building  beautiful view  it's a beautiful  place  new  why don't you  come on up  it starts like  that  the three guys  need three girls  so they you know  bring a couple  of friends  they know some  chicks  they bring them  up  and then they're  you know  doing things  and then when  they're done  doing things  they're not  just going to  hang and  chit chat  with the girls 
[00:34:00]  and now  there's already  people up there  so they invite  a few of their  guy friends over  yeah hang out  you know  watch tv  watch the game  whatever  I try to tell  my older sister  but she's like  she thought  it was just fine  oh they're good  boys she tells me  oh they're good  boys  I'm like  what were you  born  good boys  to do that  too  Eric and Lyle  yeah  how dumb  are you  Eric and Lyle  good boys  too  do you understand  that you're  oh great  here he is  oh

[00:35:30]  chick  remind me  I got his  phone  we'll have to  call him  wake him up  dude he was  banging away  until rage  started  he kind of  half threw up  off the bed  and passed out  alright we'll call  him later this  morning  hey do we have  the is Tom  alive sweeper  can we play that  today or what  of course is Tom  alive  we want to know  if he's alive  here  but it works  if we like  set it up  with a nice  sweeper  yeah  fills everyone  in  you got Danny  oh boy 
[00:36:00]  they're all  panicking  I like when  you wanted to  pop the phones  up just now  with that last  call  and Steve  he actually  pulled out  two blackberries  one in each  hand  like a  gunslinger  why would he  do that  I don't know  I needed to  make calls  maybe he was  just gonna call  you from one  and call  Jason from the  other and hold  them together  up or down  I'll do that  actually he was  calling one to  get the technical  problem taken  care of  and the other  was the honey  distributor  please I need 
[00:36:30]  more honey  here I'm in  DC I'm not  home  no not ACDC  that's my  lifestyle  Steve was  really quiet  at dinner  last night  Eric Logan  took a bunch  of us out  to a nice  steak restaurant  and Kenny  what did he  have a potato  in that little  pouch  we're discussing  mergers and  all sorts of  very interesting  things and  Steve is just  sitting there  very very quiet  and then I  kind of relayed  a story  about Kenny  like two mornings  ago when he  came to pick 
[00:37:00]  me up  I came  downstairs  and Kenny  wasn't around  and the  doorman  goes  your driver  had to  use the  restroom  and I'm  like  Kenny's  you know  so Kenny  comes out  and in front  of the  doorman  I'm like  did big  boy make  a duty  and then  Kenny of  course goes  yes big  boy did  make a  duty  so I'm  telling this  story yesterday  and then  Kenny goes  yeah I  had cantaloupe  the night  before and  it went  right through 
[00:37:30]  me and  that's when  we finally  heard from  Steve he  thought it  was the  funniest thing  last night  but then I  realized that  Kenny is like  it's like  trying to make  a horse  throw up  like you  just feed  it something  and the  next morning  it gets  rid of  whatever was  poisonous  the idea  of Kenny  holding onto  the bowl  with both  hands  really had  me laughing  explosively  hold on  cantaloupe  it goes  right through  me  it was so  forceful that  Kenny's leg  straightened  out as he  went  stupid little 
[00:38:00]  shoes  I want  to play  the sweeper  I should  tell people  I don't have  control of  anything today  it's freaking  me the F  out I have  to do a lot  of pointing  today  see this is  what happens  that's why I'm  going to play  with this pen  you're going to  hear clicking  because I  like Jimmy  talks about  he doesn't know  what to do  with his hands  when he's acting  I don't know  what to do  with my hands  if I have  nothing to push  in front of me  I'm going nuts  runs everything  so you're going  to hear this  all morning  because I have  to do something  with my hands

[01:04:30]  sound we got for our  machines  go ahead  ah  oh  here's e-rock  everybody  e-rock  why are you laughing  it is funny  kind of  when it's beep  how come you didn't  come down to dc  with this  because i had to  stay here in new york  and do some stuff  yeah they  he has to do things  up there  so  e-rock uh  are you alright  with everything  yeah i'm okay  yeah 
[01:05:00]  yeah  felt a little bad  but now i'm over it  why did you feel bad  you don't know your own  you don't know your own  strength  you know that right  yeah  but uh  you know  she was pouting a little  bit so i kind of felt  bad but then as soon as  she left it went away  are you really uh  um  hate feet that much  feet  yeah  yeah i i do kind of  have uh  an issue with that  well cause what we did  uh we're not gonna play  that cause that goes on  forever but uh  basically we made 
[01:05:30]  e-rock  uh  lick mayo  off her big  she had like  her big toe  and all her toes  and she had  she had the stripper  shoes on  and you could tell  like their feet  were probably  a little nasty  in there  all scrunched  together  in the stripper  shoes  and uh  yeah  mayo was spread  in between her toes  and on her big toe  and e-rock  had to kneel down  and and lick  and suck the mayo  off her feet  and uh  he was gagging 
[01:06:00]  and then he puked  yeah he hates feet  to begin with  right e-rock  yeah there's a  there's a serious  problem with that  i don't know where  it stems from  but i i cannot  handle feet  so you won't suck  a girl's toes  while you're in bed  with her  no  i won't even touch  them  you won't even  touch your  girlfriend's feet  no he really has  a real problem  with feet  people have that  reaction  and we made  uh we made him  do that  he had tears  in his eyes  before he did it  tears in his eyes  i guess  as he uh  goes down  for this mayo  and then finally  he started yeah 
[01:06:30]  like aunt said  puking at the end  of the whole thing  so  how long  do you hate  his feet  there's usually  women feel that  way about feet  it's not usually  guys  like i've never  met a guy  that hated feet  like that  um for as long  as i can remember  i mean it's  it's pretty  well known  that i just  can't stand  to look  or have  you know  like touch feet  can't be around it  when's the first  time you realized  that you hated  feet  i think i was  a little kid  like there were  there were points  where i wouldn't  even like uh  i'd wear socks  and shoes to the  beach because i  wouldn't walk  around barefoot  that represents 
[01:07:00]  something i don't  know what  but i've met  people that have  people have a  reaction to a  body part that's  not sexual  yeah  like i can see  guys not liking  bags or another  guy's hog  but like for not  to not like the  feet of a woman  i don't  i  that is a little  odd  it's not odd  i'm not a big  fan of the feet  no not you  don't have to  be a big fan  but i i like  them as part of  the whole package  of the woman  you know if you  chop her feet  off she looks  silly  oh yeah  she topple over  i'm not gonna  like freak out 
[01:07:30]  if i see feet  do you think  some are better  looking than  others  ah for the  most part  i don't know  really  yeah  because i think  some girls have  really nice ones  yeah but  and some look  like friggin talons  like paris hilton's  feet are disgusting  they're big huge  basketball player feet  with the tendons  that are sticking  up out of the  top of them  and then other  girls have nice  little petite  cute feet  this is one reason  why i don't like  feet  as soon as you  touch them  they're cold  they're cold 
[01:08:00]  feet in general  are colder than  other body parts  i don't know why  you're usually not  grabbing them  unless some  like sex  is gonna happen  you're on the couch  you're laying there  maybe you just  take her foot  and kiss it  i'm not like  i'm not like  e-rock  where i'm  i get a reaction  but i've  feet  whatever  you give a foot  massage  no  i'm the master  maybe a little bit  i'm the foot  massage master  do you really  no  i'm just quoting  Pulp Fiction  oh is that for that  alright e-rock 
[01:08:30]  you got anything else  you're in a ballpark  we gotta take a break  anything else e-rock  no that's it  alright  everything cool at home  um hopefully  yeah  yeah e-rock  got a little trouble  i think uh  hopefully by the end  of the weekend  maybe it should be uh  oh no  are you in the doghouse  they say  you're in the doghouse  for three days  over that  uh it seems that way  well there was  oh boy  there was nothing sexual  about what you were  doing yesterday  you pretty much  beat up a woman 
[01:09:00]  and then you licked  mayo from her toes  it was sexy  in a raging bull  sense of pride  right  man she's gotta let you  you know  she's gotta  she's just gotta  let you out  of the doghouse  man there was  nothing sexual  about that  you were vomiting  we were there  you were vomiting  right  if you're  if you're vomiting  there's nothing sexual  going on for the most part  you were vomiting  and so were her toes  yeah  well let's just say  there was um  little to no um  not just physical contact 
[01:09:30]  but maybe direct eye contact  yesterday  oh really  yeah  she won't even look  at you  uh it took a while  until she did  what was her problem  with it  um  the visualization  of  the foot  the mayonnaise  and my mouth  she couldn't even  look at me  wow there was  nothing sexual  about that  that could have  been like  you just licking  mayo from  just anything  yeah  wait wait wait  is that what it is  now or was it  that she was  grossed out 
[01:10:00]  was she mad  or grossed out  i hope she's listening  because let me tell her  uh you were looking  at the feet  and you were beyond  disgusted  you already were  tearing up  you saw black  on her toes  that was  that was really  bothering you  you started dry  heaving before  you even put  the mayo on the  on the  the toes  the fact that  you actually  took it out  and let that  girl touch it  was amazing  dude  thank god she  doesn't know  what happened  after the mics  went off  right erock  oh yeah  we should just  blow up 
[01:10:30]  his relationship  was your girl  jealous  or was she  grossed out  um  i think  it was  one she was  utterly embarrassed  two she was  disgusted  by just even  the notion  of it  and um  once i explained  that you know  it wasn't really  anything to do  of a sexual  nature  that that  seemed to  be okay  yeah  what was she  embarrassed  about  the fact  that her  boyfriend  was on  a tremendously  popular radio  show  sucking mayonnaise  a disgusting  food  when you put  it on 
[01:11:00]  ham  much less  the feet  of a woman  you've just  bruised with  your fist  also  pretty much  anything that  was male  related that  i had in the  apartment is  gone  it should be  it's disgusting  food  yeah  off the instant  feedback  erock's girl  is pissed  he's off the  diet  that's what  she's really  pissed off at  he said wait  what did he say  oh well that's  that's long gone  yeah yeah yeah  are you  are you  are you  off fat smash  totally  um i do the  maintenance mode 
[01:11:30]  but i'm not like  on the diet  just say yes  you're off it  totally  what does maintenance  mean  you look at the  book when you  walk by with a  burger in your  hand  regulating the uh  your portion  control and what  you eat  what'd you say  then  stan's got  something  only one nest  quick at a  time  that's the  rule  oh  oh  oh  can i say  reduce fat  how did i know  well erock  how much have  you put back  on  um nothing  i'm still  around 195  all right  all right  erock  you know  you gotta like  smooth things

[01:18:00]  has decided  after several  days of  testing  analysis  and  deliberation  this is what  bothers me  in the article  the decision  came thursday  night  after a  five hour  meeting  of mission  managers  oh  for five  hours  they discussed  this  at five  hours  and then  finally decided  like  ah  should be  alright  you know  that would  have taken  ten minutes  if every  one of them  went in  and went  there's no  problem  right  right  no problem  no problem  right  right  but  five hours 
[01:18:30]  means  that somebody  at least  one person  was going  look  this has  to be  fixed  look  we have  kind of  a history  of space  shuttles  blowing up  I really  believe  we should  like  maybe  get some  putty  or something  put something  in there  I don't care  bubble gum  and the rest  of them are  going  come on  it's fine  and then  they finally  wore him  down  don't be  such a  faggot  it's alright  get it out  it's not like  the old days  when we only  had like  six  seven  astronauts  we got  hundreds  of them  now  it's another  school teacher  it'll be  hilarious 
[01:19:00]  everyone loved  the first  round  but that's  what bothered  me  they talked  about this  for five  hours  and they  decided  they don't  have to  repair  this thing  before it  comes back  down to earth  so that's  going to be  I can't  we got to  find out  when it  comes back  to earth  because I'm  going to  have like  a viewing  party  we have  a viewing  party  to see  what happens  with that  so  but that  the gouge  looks pretty  bad  like we  said  I would  push  something  in there  yeah  something  I just  want to  say I'm  changing  my name  to 
[01:19:30]  Stanley  Raymer  why  Stanley  Raymer  who's  Stanley  Raymer  I don't  know  I just  want to  change  my name  to him  Stanley  Raymer  is that  what we're  going to  call you  now  from now  on  alright  do you hear  that Michael  Vick  by the way  wants to  plead guilty  and face  a year  in jail  he's gonna  go to jail  for a year  man  give him  some street  cred  dude  when you're  a quarterback  and your  whole life  is banging  broads  and playing  football  in front of  the entire  country  and he was  one of the  best quarterbacks  in the last  10 years  as far as  scrambling  he's great  and that's  a long time 
[01:20:00]  for an NFL  quarterback  one year  yes  in your prime  it's not like  they play  20 years  like the  baseball guys  if they get  7 good years  then they're  happy  I feel bad  for dumb  Falcon fans  they got a  guy here  he's just  in the prime  of his career  he's fantastic  but you know  that his lawyers  are saying  look Michael  you have to  do this  this could  get really  ugly  you could  go away  for a long  time  I guess  they would  travel to  other states  and they would  fight dogs  and I guess  if they're  really coming  after you  they get you  an interstate 
[01:20:30]  rap  they were  really  into this  well maybe  it could be  like the  longest yard  and he could  be the  quarterback  of the  prison  football  team  everyone  would love  him  he's just  going to  pick up  a dog  head  at the  end  shoot him  a dog  head  how great  is that scene  when he's  going  crew  shoot him  shoot him  his story  and I want  a point spread  a 21 point  spread 
[01:21:00]  what a creep  yeah  who's better  on green acres  so we'll see  how that plays  out  a year in jail  he's going  by the way  Long Island  is laughing  at me today  because I said  NASA  NASA  NASA  it's  mispronunciation  Friday  though  you gotta  give me a break  oh it is  yeah so  yeah NASA  of course  also we got  audio of  a drunk  flight attendant  yelling during  her arrest  Danny says  this audio  is really good  do we know  the back story  on this  why she's  being arrested  I don't know  obviously she's  drunk  but you could  still do your  job drunk  I'm thinking 
[01:21:30]  so she had  to do  something else  well the flight  had to be  cancelled I think  because by  arresting her  that was  too few people  on the crew  so she's in  trouble  none of the flight  crew was allowed  to be drunk  you can't take  the plane off  but I'm just  saying  but flight  attendants are  part of the  flight crew  you haven't seen  the pilots  drinking and  then get on  the plane  you're on  no  you've never  seen that  before  never  we could  take stories  all morning  I'm sure  some people  have  but pilots  get arrested  for that  and lose  their license  now it's not  as easy  to get that 
[01:22:00]  done  obviously  they used  to go and  hung over  a lot more  and put the  oxygen on  but back  in the day  you'd see  them in the  airport bar  having a beer  and then  they're going  on the  plane first  is that  what they  would do  put the  oxygen on  I didn't  know that  if they  were hung  over  oxygen is  great for  hangovers  that's what  the whole thing  is you just  kind of poison  yourself  they got a  12 hour  bottle to  throttle rule  with the  FAA  so you need  12 hours  to wind down  and I know  there have been  some times I've 
[01:22:30]  drank where  12 hours later  I wouldn't be  able to fly  an aircraft  I could barely  navigate my way  to the bathroom  to vomit  never mind  flying a plane  12 hours  later  but maybe  that's it  but I've  never seen  a pilot  why would a  pilot sit  at a bar  in the airport  and then get  up and get  on a plane  now a  flight attendant  because the  pilots know  how easy  it is  to fly  you're just  looking at  instruments  yeah you're  just looking  at some  things  punching some  numbers in  yeah well 
[01:23:00]  what do we  got  the flight  attendant  isn't just  to bring  you drink  they are  supposed to be  there for the  safety of the  passengers  they're supposed  to do things  yeah  it's like having a  drunk waitress  I don't care  I have a belt  honey get me  it would be funny  to watch your  waitress  get me some pretzels  would you  stumble and buy  with your food  there you go  fella  flight attendant  there you go  sweetie pants  what do we got  Danny  well apparently  the pilot had  it was brought  to the pilot's  attention that  she was a little  tipsy and he  immediately put  the brakes on  the plane  it was right  before it took  off I mean  everybody was 
[01:23:30]  on the plane  so they took  her off the  plane  he just put  the brakes on  so she'd slam  into that door  that thing  in the front  staggering  she must have  been hammered  for that  yeah  well you know  they'll say so  in the story  but she didn't  blow very high  of a test  but from the  audio  just the co-pilot  oh sorry  I didn't know  you were talking  about alcohol  level  but from the  audio that is  in the story  she's obviously 
[01:24:00]  extremely intoxicated  wow  oh cool  let's listen  to this  but police say  not only did  Sarah Mills  of Atlanta  get drunk  on Jack Daniels  the 26 year old  flight attendant  boarded a plane  ready to work  the aircraft's  captain pumped  the brakes  on the Atlanta  bound plane  turning it around  before leaving  Lexington  he then called  police  do you require  immediate medical  attention 
[01:24:30]  yes  why for  because I'm  thinking about  punching the people  but bound by  handcuffs  Mills could do  little more  than hurl insults  she repeatedly  admitted to being  drunk  begging officers  to let her go  I'm drunk  I'm drunk  what's this to you  let me go  I got work to do  in the 911 call  she says  she's gonna punch  some people  oh god 
[01:25:00]  right on man  they're supposed to be  there for the people's  safety  yeah  do that safety  demonstration  how could she show  how the oxygen mask  is supposed to be put on  the young ones first  before yourself  well she was  improv  she's drunk  she put it over her breast  and she was like  look  it's a hat  it's a hat  it's a milking machine  moo  like a madonna  from the 80s  we  I thought I saw  one time a flight attendant  it might have been  like a speech thing  I was on the flight  and my friend's like 
[01:25:30]  Stanley look  and the flight attendant  was like a little bit  slurry  but I'm like  no I don't think  it was drunk  it seemed like  the person was  very coherent  but the voice  was a little odd  why would you  call yourself  Stanley  I'm just talking  about something  it's irrelevant  why are you calling  yourself Stanley  especially a story  about a while ago  when I think  you just changed  your name  to Stanley  like moments ago  I've been Stanley  Reimer for years  Stanley what?  look  look  Autumn from Indiana 
[01:26:00]  very funny  very funny  Stanley Reimer  or Reimer  how do you say  his last name?  my name  Reimer  Reimer  Reimer  very funny Jimmy  hold on  it updated  hope your girlfriend  isn't feeling faint  today  what is going on  I have a hero  and the man's name  is Stanley  a hero  Kansas City man  accused of  tossing ailing wife  from balcony  over medical bills  oh my god  a man 
[01:26:30]  oh no  threw his  seriously ill wife  four stories  to her death  because he couldn't  afford to pay  for her medical care  wow  oh is he wonderful  oh I bet  Michael Moore  is just kicking  himself that  that didn't happen  sooner so he can  interview this guy  for sicko  according to  court documents  filed Wednesday  Stanley Reimer  walked his wife  to the balcony  of their apartment  and kissed her  before throwing her 
[01:27:00]  over  gave her a little  peck  oh how you feeling  my head  just shoved her  over the edge  he gave her a good  wow  that's how you  close out that  HMO account  what did she have  uh  I don't know  let's see  neurological problems  and oh  uterine cancer  cancer of the uterus  oh the big casino  Tony  oh boy  yeah 
[01:27:30]  he  wow  threw her  oh wow  look at that  she had no health  insurance to pay  for the bills  that were seven  eight hundred dollars  a week  that is kind of  sickening  now that I know  I've taken this  man's name upon  myself  wow  he threw his wife  over because he  couldn't afford to  pay her bills  it's a lovely country  and then there's  another story  where we pay  Canada  where they pay  everything  Pentagon paid  nine hundred and  ninety eight thousand  dollars to ship  two nineteen cent  washers  yeah  is that true  I've read that too  yeah  how could that  be true  it's a crime 
[01:28:00]  because bills  are paid  automatically  if they're  considered rush  for Iraq  work  right  and they  had billed  over twenty  million dollars  in the last  over six years  it was shipping  costs  this company  that distributed  these parts  would ship  and then charge  them shipping  so the actual  cost of the item  is pennies  but the shipping  for that item  would cost  a million dollars  pretty much  and since  nobody was  keeping tabs  on this  because like  Jimmy said  it's one of  these emergency 
[01:28:30]  rush jobs  like somebody  in Iraq  needs a lock  washer  that costs  a few cents  they would  bill the  government  a million dollars  to ship it  a million dollars  per trip to Iraq  yeah  a million dollars  per like  washer  yeah  two washers  a million bucks  right  per plane load  a million dollars  to go to Iraq  not per plane load  per one item  what  that's it  one item  one little  lock washer  would 
[01:29:00]  would cost  a million dollars  to ship  because the guy  realized  after a while  he started  like small  and realized  nobody's keeping  tabs on how much  the shipping costs  on this  so he just kept  billing them  more and more  and more  and somebody  finally caught on  somebody finally  looked through  some of the paperwork  and went  whoa  that's a lot  of money  for shipping  let me look  back and see  you know  some of this  other stuff  and just saw  that this  guy from this  company  is just  the scum  of the earth  I think they're  women  Charlene Corley 
[01:29:30]  I believe  they're sisters  wow  I think they  should actually  be shot  for treason  they should be  that's a treacherous  act  that years ago  they would have  been just  shot  they would have  tied them up  and shot them  that's a  that's a crime  against the nation  during a war  killed over there  and these  idiots are  like profiting  like that  and they're  talking about  like the oil  companies  or other people  exploiting  for money  and stuff  at least 
[01:30:00]  those guys  are over there  driving trucks  risking their  lives  to service  the nation  to transport  oil  or whatever  people are here  just profiteering  should be  shot  amazing  alright  and that money  which you were  getting to also  that money  maybe could have  gone to  paying the woman's  medical bills  so she didn't  need the old  kissing goodbye  na na na  na na na 
[01:30:30]  and she chimed in  because she didn't  know what was  happening  she went  say hey  and she felt  a foot in her  back  good foof  goodbye  and she heard  old Stan  finishing the  verse  as she plummeted  that's such  a horrific story  it's terrible  what a waste  of money  how does  nobody monitor  shipping costs  I know  something like that  how does it not  a computer  it's gotta go to  Iraq  so it's urgent  don't even look  at anything  just send it  maybe they can 
[01:31:00]  have a thing  where you have  to submit  the weight  of whatever  you ship  and if it's  less than an ounce  and the billing  is more than  eight dollars  there's a problem  there's a problem  yeah a computer  could have done  this  think of that  money also  the government  paid all that  money  that could have  gone to the  Kevlar  that the guys  need over there  the armor plating  for the Humvees  to help against  the roadside  explosives  yeah that  these people  don't even  think of that  they're profiteering  they're virtually  having people  killed over there  because of their 
[01:31:30]  irresponsibility  to make a few  bucks  shot  yeah I agree  shot for  high treason  alright we gotta  take a break  we got more  drunk audio  from the flight  attendant  is it quick  alright yeah  can we hear that  because we just  did that story  more audio  from the drunk  flight attendant  this video  shows a less  than sober scene  excuse me  that was my  f***ing ID  and later in a  holding cell 
[01:32:00]  she's captured  crawling on the  ground  pressing her hands  and face  into the glass  it's behavior  that's not  sitting well  with Atlantic  Southeastern Airlines  and Delta Connection  according to their  policy  getting drunk  won't fly  that is my  that is my  wings  of the f***ing  flight attendant  thank you  for everybody  in here  excuse me 
[01:32:30]  I wanna go home  the video  is great too  because wherever  they had her  detained  there was this  big glass window  and they have  surveillance footage  so they were  showing up  the news of her  she's just on  all fours  just pressing  her face up  against the glass  like looking  and she's  you know  just looks like  a mime  in a box  I would love  to know  what some of  these people  think  when they  watch that  video  after they're  in the drunk  tank the whole  night  and they wake  up  and they watch  the video  and go  oh my god  look what I did  oh boy  oh look what I did  I don't even 
[01:33:00]  remember  oh I did that  Jimmy any uh  it's not a good  feeling  I didn't wake  up in jail  yeah I actually  did once  but you kind  of realize  like something  happened  there's not  people smiling  around me  oh  it's not  and you have  vague memories  and they're like  please god  let that have  been a dream  please let that  have been a dream  no that wasn't  oh man  yeah she's  feeling bad  when she wakes  up  I thought the  FBI was after  me  is that what  you didn't  that what you  thought  the FBI  oh it's  demanded to be 
[01:33:30]  taken to jail  yeah you demanded  to be taken  to jail  yeah and they  wouldn't come  and get me  so I walked  to jail  and they put  me in  and I was like  but I want  to go home  and they're like  no  then you wanted  to go home  yeah of course  I was a nerd  you're confused  you walked  yourself to jail  and demanded  the arrest  I was a psychopath  bad drunk  I was awful  I love it  pulled a butcher  knife on my friend  and then uh  you know I held  it to his throat  and then I  finally just gave  it to him  because I was like  I'm blacked out  here  I'm blacked out  here  and then later  he gave it back  he goes no I  I know you  wouldn't hurt me 
[01:34:00]  so I pulled  on him again  like how stupid  you are  I should have  my teeth kicked  in  this is why  when we come  back  somebody can  explain  I have a  question about  space  this is where  we need  Dr. Kaku  who I hope  now sees  and is also  obsessed with  oh  well yeah  he waits  online with  his little  skim milk  he likes  to  and I'm  glad that  he's eating  healthy  because we  want to get  some more  stuff out  of this  guy's brain  hey  we were talking  about super bad  89% good  reviews from  rottentomatoes.com  we have the

[01:39:30]  like thank  god we have  something to go  to right now  so we picked  up Andrew  and uh  yeah you hear  him breathing  and stuff  yeah what's  with that  well I was  so nervous  I started  thinking right  away I think  this guy is  really nervous  I think there's  something going  on with this  guy  yeah  okay we're  thinking what  he's some  guy in his  40s  probably still  lives with  his mother  that's what  I assumed  yeah a little  weird a little  Norman Bates  thing going on  the picture I got  was an overweight  guy in his  40s maybe  living in his  mom's basement 
[01:40:00]  his father's  long gone  yeah  doesn't really  work  what are you  doing down  there Andrew  mom I've  got to finish  this  never I'm  building a  model of  mom I have  to do this  now  all right  uh uh  Jimmy  your egg white  omelet  there you go  all right so  Andrew uh  continues so  we we  our eyebrows  were raised  there we're  like hmm  he's a bit  nervous we  should get  into this a  little bit  the call  continues  wait start 
[01:40:30]  over yeah  one more  time  um on  this date  in 1858  james  duchanan  president james  duchanan  inaugurates  a new  transatlantic  telegraph cable  system by  greeting queen  victoria  oh so it  was a  transatlantic  uh cable  and he  he was able  to talk to  queen victoria  on it  telegraph  oh telegraph  so he used  like a morse

[01:41:30]  out fun fact  fun fact  he has one  of those weird  voices you like  hearing on the  radio  there's something  about it  a little off  so we start  getting into the  uh you know the  idea of having  him call every  thursday  all right  hey andrew  hold on we  want you  calling every  week with a  fun fact  okay  all right  i won't be  here next  week  where are you  going  where are you  going to be  um i can't  tell  oh you sure  can just give  us something  vague you  don't have to  be specific  yeah yeah  i'll be out of

[01:42:30]  paranoia about  and now we're  starting to think  wait a minute  i'm picturing a  guy in his  40s living  with his mom  in a basement  and now he's  saying he's  going away with  his family  and he's all  nervous and  you only go away  with your family  when you're a bit  younger  yeah  you're not like  in your 30s  or 40s  going on a  family vacation  with mom and dad  maybe you're married  you're taking your  wife and kids  yeah that's true  that thought  never entered my  mind that this  guy was married  not even  not even for a  second  so uh  here is the 
[01:43:00]  big reveal  we find out  how old  andrew really is  i pictured in  his 40s  aunt  same thing  jimmy  what do you think  at least an adult  and i thought he was  going away with his  family  wife and kids  oh you really  yeah yeah  all right  this is where we  find out how old  andrew from  brooklyn is the  space endeavor  guy  do you work for  the government  love  andrew  andrew  do you work for  the government  do you work for  the government  yeah what do you do  for a living  i'm a teenager  you're a teenager  i didn't hear a word  you said dude 
[01:43:30]  what you're how old  i'm 14  no you're not  yes i am  are you  yes  and i'm about to  start the 10th grade  soon  well then why don't  you just say you're a  teenager  um  i was just trying to  say the fun fact  i was just trying to 
[01:44:00]  say the fun fact  a fun fact  14th going into the  10th grade  we did a little math  it looks like he's  going to graduate high  school from 16  so not only is he not  in his 40s living in  his mom's basement  this guy is uber smart  he's a genius  he's kind of like one  of those kid geniuses  the idiot savant  he's 14  when he said that  it floored me  uh and then it  continues here  we get more from  andrew who now we  learned is 14 years  old  when's your when's  your when's your  birthday how old 
[01:44:30]  when are you gonna  be 15  october 31st  oh on halloween  oh we're gonna  celebrate your  birthday this year  okay  uh no no no  thanks  why what's why  wouldn't you want  to celebrate uh  your birthday with  us  no don't please  don't celebrate  i don't want  i don't get in  trouble with my  parents about this  or anything  no you won't get  in trouble at all  don't worry about  we'll keep it all  quiet it'll be our  little secret  andrew we love you  on this show so  you gotta call from  time to time with  your fun facts okay  i can't i have to 
[01:45:00]  start school soon  so now he doesn't  want to celebrate  his birthday he  can't call because  he's gotta start  school soon  now he's just  backpedaling out of  pure fear of  something  what a nut this  kid like his  parents just beat  the crap out of  him or something  i love this  kid we gotta get  into this but he  doesn't want to  give you too much  now please don't  celebrate my birthday  don't celebrate my  birthday  who's gonna know  i can't call  school starts what  does school have to  do with calling like  this huge radio show  every once in a while 
[01:45:30]  and what are we  gonna do if we  celebrate his  birthday right  right that's gonna  get him in trouble  he is so paranoid  uh all right and  then we get back into  the space shuttle  endeavor  space shuttle endeavor  hey could you do  your space shuttle  endeavor fun fact for  everybody you never  got it out the uh  two weeks ago  yeah what happened  they use spare parts  i was just trying to  state that um  this shuttle was built  in in 1991 in order  to replace challenger  yeah but what uh 
[01:46:00]  what uh shuttle was  built  is the new one the  challenger too  huh  is the new one also  called the challenger  no it's called endeavor  oh okay it's the  what what and that's  a um a space what  what do they call it  the uh a space shuttle  the space shuttle  orbiter oh and it's  called the what this  one that's currently in  space wait this one  currently in space is  which one we're you got  so confused 
[01:46:30]  endeavor endeavor  that's the one that's  currently in space  wow  special orbiter  orbiter  special endeavor  special  special endeavor  uh and then uh  he just needs to tell  everyone that the  space shuttle endeavor  endeavor  is spelled uh  differently than you  think  yes  oh  all right  all right  did you hear about  and oh  the spelling for  endeavor is british  is british  it does not have 
[01:47:00]  the letter u in it  wait you say so  you're saying the  spelling is is  american but the  or  no the the spelling  of this spacecraft  is in british  oh it's in british  why is that  they had this name  and contest back in  1989  and they had  school students  named the space  shuttle  who named him  andrew i'm sorry  i didn't hear you  school students  okay  school students 
[01:47:30]  and what do they  name it  they named it  endeavor  by the way it's  being pointed out  by uh nate sack  that uh  he's not a kid  genius he'll  probably graduate  high school  when he's 17  he did all the  math and when  the cutoff date  is and all that  crap yeah  he's gonna turn  18 a couple  months into his  first year of  college  some weird  birthday thing  yeah so he's uh  he's slightly young  for his age  he's slightly young  for his age  i mean slightly  i'm young for my age  slightly young for  his grade there  and then finally we 
[01:48:00]  wrapped up and we're  like wow andrew's  giving us some good  radio with the whole  space shuttle endeavor  and this new  and this new phone  call  all we want to do  is give the kid a  prize and the  paranoia came back  andrew thank you  you got so many  good fun facts  today  oh no  oh boy the  disc  take it out of  the machine and  blow on it real  fast  blow on it  we'll go to  kelly from long  island while you  see if the disc  can be played  kelly what's up  kelly 
[01:48:30]  listen  hi guys  love the show  hi jimmy  hi kelly  i just wanted to  call in  it's been a couple  weeks now  you guys keep  saying the word  uber  and it's killing  me  please please talk  why  because it's very  annoying it's not  like you guys  it's a corny word  for you guys to  be using  you're being an  uber goose  we use uber a lot  yeah i'm an uber  fan he's an uber  fan he's an uber  smart  guys gotta stop  i think you should  get a better word  you can make up  like your own word  uber 
[01:49:00]  uber  it's no good  what's wrong with  it what word  should we use  it's a good word  yeah  i don't know  maybe like really  or extra  uber's just so  or super  i prefer uber  it reminds me of  goober  so you want us to  use extra instead  kelly  extra  anything but uber  how about this  you got an extra  large twat  oh  oh  goodbye  could say uber  oh  oh 
[01:49:30]  they had to dump  out of that  of course  hey uh  can we play it again  or no  we're re-burning it  re-burning it  10 to 15 seconds  oh my god  5 seconds  oh my god  5 seconds  to burn something  we have to improv  we have to improv  right now  it's pretty fast  actually  wow  it takes me so long  to burn things  oh yeah  they're movies  first run  all right  we're gonna play  the last clip here  so andrew  gave us great radio  so we're like  hey  why not give him 
[01:50:00]  a prize from the  fine open anthony  prize closet  yeah  and uh  the paranoia came  back big time  we got it now  all right let's  give it another try  here  andrew thank you  you got so many  good fun facts  uh today  we want to hear  from you again  yeah hold on a line  we're gonna try  to give you a prize  okay  no no no  i don't want anything  why don't you want  anything  why not  andrew why  you're such a shy guy  my parents  i'm sorry  why your parents  would be mad  if they found out  you were talking to us  yeah sort of  why they don't like 
[01:50:30]  the show  uh not really  no but you're  your own guy  andrew right  you're just  breaking into manhood  there and finding  your own  and you you like  the opium anthony  show and we'd like  to you know  give you a little  prize  no thanks  i'll still listen  to the show  you might have to  get rid of those  pesky parents of  yours  you know what i  mean andrew  they might need  to be corrected  his name is  andrew chiasano  all right andrew  i i guess here's  the deal uh 
[01:51:00]  you call back  when you can  okay  okay  i'm gonna put you  on hold just in  case you want a  prize  the guys want to  talk to you  you don't have  to give any  address or  anything  endeavor to  call back  all right  okay  all right  andrew from  brooklyn everyone  all right so  we're back live  so we go  no no i don't  want no he got  so panicky  i love him  and we put him  on hold by the  time travis  picked him up  he was gone  no prize for  andrew he was  like i'm out of  here  no no  no i don't  want to call  with the fun  fact  no i don't  want to prize  he's amazing 
[01:51:30]  he's an odd  kid  he really is  who knows when  he'll call back  again  we hope he calls  soon because we  can't get enough  of andrew from  brooklyn  all right  i don't know  i would think  somebody that's  like that his  parents probably  very strict  disciplinarians  he's obvious i  think he's i  think he's foreign  he's the accent  i don't know where  he's from but  he might be an  ethnic parent like  indian parents  something that  are more school  oriented yeah  like this foolishness  but he's probably  nonsense  he's probably  listening to our  show kind of  like under his  pillow you  ever do that  when you were 
[01:52:00]  a kid like  you find  something that  was a bit  you know you  were paranoid  that you know  that your parents  were gonna find  out so you  gotta muffle it  you kind of  muffle it under  your pillow a  little bit  radio screams  of a woman  whatever you  need to muffle  with that pillow  all right we  gotta step aside  for a second  here we'll be  back it's  opie and anthony  live from dc  i think that 
[01:52:30]  needs a little  grease that  microphone  that is a  nasty let's  all move our  mic stands for  a second  professional  broadcasting at  its best  that's all of  our mic stands  moving you  know that  you know that  drives everybody  down here like  crazy because  they're all like  really into  textile they want  everything to run 
[01:53:00]  smoothly and what  do you do  you just knock  the cover on  the windscreen  comes off i can't  wait to read on  the message board  oh mic moving  that's good radio  well it's opie  and anthony and  jim norton we're  live from dc and  it's funny you  should say that  because i got to  correct someone  here d-royal  correct or d-royal  from florence  south carolina  is he attempting  to bring an  outside party  into this  situation  he's attempting  to be uh to  be a douche  is what he's  doing doing a  good job of  sounds like he's  succeeding at being  a douche 
[01:53:30]  yes  well now i gotta  explain radio to  him i hate when i  have to stop the  show to explain  radio to people  why are you  teaching people  radio this is  off to the  instant feedback  take our job  he writes this is  wrong replaying the  andrew bit for  regular radio  you guys were  gone from xm for  30 days and it  and didn't make  free uh free radio  re-listen to a  single bit it truly is  frustrating  what do you mean  see he thinks the  andrew calls that have  come in so far there's  been two he thinks 
[01:54:00]  they're kind of like an  xm thing you know  after we go off the  regular radio stations  and that we're taking  that material from xm and  replaying it for  regular radio and d that's  not true the andrew  calls have come on  uh you know uh we  we we went to them  when we were talking  to everybody yeah and  the reason we're  replaying the uh the  the andrew from  brooklyn phone calls  is because we're this  is where i tear down a  wall anthony here it  come oh my god look at  he's taking it down i'm 
[01:54:30]  tearing down a wall  crowbar it's not hard  the rats have eaten most  of it the reason we're  replaying the andrew  phone calls a couple  times is because we're  trying to establish a  radio bit yeah we want  a lot of people to  understand and know  andrew from brooklyn so  the next you is so the  next time he calls people  gonna be like oh that's  the guy that's the  space i know that i was  telling you about and  just because of this guy  listens uh a lot right  thank you very much but  you know but he listen a  lot he's got it wrong 
[01:55:00]  other people don't this  the andrew calls have  been heard uh when we  have the biggest audience  which means xm and all  our regular radio stations  we played it yesterday  just before he went off  the air for regular radio  so regular radio heard it  we decided to play it a  little earlier today  hopefully to get a whole  new audience that didn't  hear it yesterday that's  how radio works i forget  that i bring in the  construction crew get that  wall back up i miss i  used to listen to imus when  i was a kid and uh like a  couple hours later he  would replay a bit a lot of  morning shows it's like  because the people it's a 
[01:55:30]  new audience and i'm not a  radio expert i learned that  from obi if a moby worm was  coming to your school i would  uh replay it later right  and i'd listen and be like  why is moby worm going to  the same school yeah because  i'd hear it earlier and go  moby worms going but he's  going to eat the same  school what was moby  worm supposed to do  moby worm baby moby  worm's coming to get you  and then uh imus would um  describe like this was  pretty lame he would have  he must have had a map or  something and and he would 
[01:56:00]  look at a neighborhood and  say all right moby worm is  uh he's at the corner of  like uh main street and elm  right about now and uh moby  worm is now moving uh eastbound  down elm street and i should  be uh if you're in that area  uh watch out moby worm's  coming and then moby worm would  walk his way around and if you  lived there like moby worms in  bayshore you'd be like moby  worms in bayshore yeah oh my god  i'm right on the street moby  worm is on right and of course 
[01:56:30]  it wasn't a moby worm there  was no moby but that's another  radio trick like but you'd be  like oh my goodness he's right  i know where that street is i  know where that is well it's  another radio trick that  consultants came up with let's  say you're doing a weather  break consultants yeah and  you're doing like just a dumb  weather break for your dumb  freaking local town or local  city they would tell you look  man instead of just saying it's  uh it's 80 degrees out yeah  name a town so you go all right  it's 80 degrees in bayshore and  then all those people in bayshore  let's say are supposed to feel 
[01:57:00]  a little special because you  mentioned their particular town  yeah and stupid radio  consultants thought this would  actually get more listeners and  i like this one what imus is  doing he's just taking that  concept and but he at least  tried to make it a little more  interesting by having this  imaginary moby worm thing and  moby worm you sound like i'm  moby worm baby because it was  just imus with a little lower  voice it was it was really an  i love imus but i'm gonna go on 
[01:57:30]  the record moby worm stinks yeah  how's your donkey kong used to  say that too how's your donkey  kong baby how's your donkey kong  god bless reverend al well i don't  think that's justified hey speaking  of reverend al where is he  broadcasting from speaking of  reverend al we didn't mention this  yesterday but uh uh a rapper told  reverend al suck my blank about the  whole about the whole trying to 
[01:58:00]  clean up uh rap lyrics god bless  that rapper i don't know his name  but he came out and said reverend  al could suck my  and it was a tough word and i guess  in the rap world it's somebody we  should know  yes david a what david banner what  david banner dude your mic doesn't  work david banner hold on steve david  banner david banner david banner david  david banner david banner is he a big  rapper he's pretty big he's especially  big in the south okay what do you say 
[01:58:30]  about southern rappers yeah what do you  say to sharpton like he's he really  said suck my oh yeah yeah i think a lot  of them have the same sentiment towards  reverend al he said something about  jesse jackson too i don't have the  direct quote in front of me but yeah  yeah it's funny you didn't say that  when imus was on the stick they never  do  no because it wasn't them can somebody  explain something to me well maybe  anthony can i don't know oh i'll try  but but i i pride myself in on being  smart too well my if you would let me  finish i was gonna say maybe anthony 
[01:59:00]  can  oh he certainly can  maybe okay maybe anthony can  it's what a dick i love it we have  broken the speed of light oh my  goodness a pair of german and this is  amazing news it's kind of nerdy but it  is amazing uh german physics of course  german yeah claim to have broken the  speed of light uh it's an achievement  that would undermine by using jews as  fuel  they found out jews are very high in  octane those germans they said this is 
[01:59:30]  going to undermine our entire  understanding of space and time this is  where cock would be great um 186 000 miles  the second as we all know is the speed  of light yeah and einstein says that  nothing in in nature can exceed that  speed i think that they've reached that  speed yeah that they they said that  they've had two energetic packets of  light travel instantaneously between a  pair of prisms i don't know what that  means that they said pink floyd all right  yeah prism they said uh travel in wait 
[02:00:00]  between a pair yeah is it a prism yeah  on the cover oh oh of the greatest album  of all time i don't like that one well  lizard of oz no i like it all right um  parisade wait energetic packets of light  this is what scientists annoy me yes they  say that they've measured that they travel  instantaneously between a pair of prisms that  have been moved up to three feet apart  could you put them farther apart how you're  going you're trying to measure something  goes 186 000 miles a second now i want you  to the earth is 25 000 miles circumference 
[02:00:30]  stretch the earth out lengthwise multiply  that to get 186 000 that's like a bunch of  earths yeah that's a second multiple  rotations around the earth in a second so  they're trying to measure something and  they go three feet let's move it three  feet apart you'll put prism one there i'll  hold the prism one here and we can look at  each other and we'll measure you think the  scientists are sitting there going each  other now don't blink it's about to happen  don't blink don't blink and go it's here  instantaneously got it but this is what i don't 
[02:01:00]  get uh being able to travel faster than the  speed of light would lead to a wide variety  of bizarre consequences for instance an  astronaut moving faster than the speed of  light would theoretically arrive at a  destination before leaving because space  time is very warped and weird again i know  none of it caco would laugh at me and  explain it while ordering a skim milk i  don't can somebody explain to me how that  happens how you would travel the speed of  light faster than and arrive before leaving i 
[02:01:30]  don't get it now my mind doesn't wrap the  only thing i could really grasp of this is  the fact that light travels at the speed of  light yes so the image of you leaving let's  say you went faster than the speed of light  mm-hmm coming you're going faster than the  speed of light you reach a planet and you have  time of course to set up this theoretical high  the powered telescope you then turn it back on  the trail that you took to get to this planet and 
[02:02:00]  you're going faster than light you the light the  reflection the image of you leaving would be in  that telescope because you've you've left faster  than the light of you leaving could get there so  you would actually see yourself leaving earth whoa so  oh theoretically you not talk monday because  it's free for all because we're on the road but but  you would actually arrive first but it would appear  that you hadn't because the image of you is was still  behind it all yeah but with the image of you travel 
[02:02:30]  at the speed of light as well if you're traveling at  the speed of light at the speed of light then it  would be instant but if you're going fast but  there's also a thing where the time itself gets a  little screwy with the speed of light so perhaps you  would uh go back in time why do they know that how  about if it's two o'clock here yeah it's two o'clock in  a black hole is this like bill and ted stuff it's yeah it  is right dan's got something on there yeah i took  relativity a while back but uh so it's a little rusty but 
[02:03:00]  like if you have uh a pair of twins and you have one  stationary and you send one traveling stationary meaning  still like yes so like elvis's brother um and then you um  so you have one not moving and then another moving they  don't necessarily even have to move um the speed of light  they could travel close to the speed of light yeah the  person that's been traveling will come back and see their twin  could be 20 years older yes that i've heard and you age 
[02:03:30]  differently when you travel the speed of light yes but i don't  know why like for like theoretically you would arrive  before you left you want a simple little tied up answer to this  whole thing don't you well i mean there's got to be a this is where  again i'm not going to say his name because people are tired of  mentioning the good doctor what doctor kaku oh god he would  explain these things to a novice very well that was his  brilliance let's get him on the show i would love to i was too  scared to say hi to me too i say hi dr kaku what's that i give him the 
[02:04:00]  creeps press lobby you idiot if you're getting sucked into it like if  you're getting sucked into a black hole yeah somebody on the event horizon  yeah would see differently it's just bizarre crap i know none of it but i  want to know if i'm traveling 186 000 miles a second i'm fine but if i go  186 000 and 50 miles a second i've arrived before i left what a load of  crap our brains can't comprehend no because we're living in our reality but 
[02:04:30]  it's not the real reality i'm thinking more like i'm a sammy hagar i can't  drive 55 make the devil horns my hands uh club soda kenny  everybody can you imagine that he actually has the answer i can't wait to  hear yeah it's just like if you're standing in the aisle of an airplane or  a train yeah and you jump up and then you add  like you land five rows back incidentally no you don't you don't  yeah because the train's going no you're moving  everything's relative that's what relativity means 
[02:05:00]  you're moving relative sorry to the train sorry and but relative to the outside  you are moving no yeah but the train kenny jump up right now jump up jump up  jump up no no it's just like if an elevator was crashing jump up  now how come the water didn't smash any yet we're moving at a thousand miles an  hour as earth as earth is rotating a thousand miles an hour moving why didn't  you end up no it's not just because somebody said it is  oh jeez the world is on a tortoise's back  hey uh i got something on this whole thing how about we just 
[02:05:30]  find a chicken spanker that would help like if my hand travels the speed of  light i could watch it spank while being in the other room and and before you  even spanked her you'd be spanking her can somebody there's got to be a listener  out there who understands like nathaniel gave the twins thing about the aging  thing which is a fine fact you can learn that's reading a time life book  you know john in cincinnati a show that's bombing injured himself and his  cousin ned felt it and too so who cares  you can't reach the speed of light though no no no who says lights the fastest 
[02:06:00]  you can't see because you increase the mass of whatever it is that you're trying  to accelerate to the speed of light the closer you get to the speed of light  it gets more mass so it takes more energy to move that mass and it gets to the  point where before you hit the speed of light  the object has so much mass you can't even budge the damn thing there are ways  that they will make things appear instantaneously and that's how  civilizations travel our understanding of physics is continually being 
[02:06:30]  uh changed that much i know i don't believe a guy that was you know born in  the 1800s yeah that he knew everything when did  einstein die in the 50s yeah yeah something like that what the  hell could he possibly know well quantum was a hack he couldn't marry  quantum with relativity he did that he did all that stuff without computers  wow that's a damn good point yeah all right that is a damn good point with no  computers just a dummy licking his pencil with that wacky hairdo 
[02:07:00]  wow that's damn no computers you're right hey uh can we do this one last thing  before we get out of here don't forget tomorrow night the big show at the  nissan pavilion in virginia i like saying the big shoe the on a  trial and virus comedy show plenty of tickets still available you can still  get a ticket get there early for the tailgating the on a village and then  finally eight or nine comedians you know in love for the show  how'd you say it anthony i'm sorry the big shoe the big shoe thank you jim  thank you show but take out that w and put an e and that's how we're saying it  it's funny i want to squeeze this in there's scams uh going on all over the 
[02:07:30]  city scams doesn't matter what city you live in uh you brought up the old one  where you try to buy what a vcr back i was very upset that i missed out on  this great deal we were doing a gig in the city and one of the guys that was  working on the road crew actually uh bought a camcorder and this was i i'm so  into video and and this was before i had a camcorder i wanted one so badly  and this uh this a gentleman walked up to one of the guy on our crew and said  i have a camcorder here uh i'm selling it for a hundred bucks 
[02:08:00]  and everyone was just like all right all right we'll take it we'll take it the guy  goes no no i'll take it so he gives the guy a hundred bucks the guy  takes off pretty quickly and he realizes that shrink wraps a little thick  on this box a little thick but it's okay had pictures of camcorders of a  camcorder on there cut out of a magnet so he's he's trying to open the the  shrink wrap and it's very hard so he gets like a scissors out of one of the  roadie kits and and cuts through it and then all of those pictures of the 
[02:08:30]  camcorders just kind of slide off the box once the shrink wrap came up  even tape no and he realized underneath there were it was an ad from uh uh the  old whiz remember the whiz sure nobody beats the whiz uh it was it was ads from  the whiz that he just clipped out pictures of camcorders and stuck them all  over and shrink wrapped it and um inside were rolled up uh new york times  yeah just loaded rolled up new york times did they have video capability and uh yes 
[02:09:00]  they actually took great video i'll bet you in a second of panic he held the  papers up to his eye gone please okay guys do something please please oh god  don't look at me i've gotten it taken because just like that light thing your  brain takes a while to register that you're just like scammed like oh you're  taken well and and then he looks around trying to look get the guy like the guy's  so stupid he'd be standing there waiting for him yes the guy was so long gone well  we're running out of show but uh there's a brand new scam we want uh to warn 
[02:09:30]  people about oh okay we got the audio public service hit it  east bay got a big disappointment after learning where the monitor really came  from lisa chan shows us what they got instead  that's crazy yeah that's new to me haven't heard of that one there's a new  scam on the street rocks in the box this man did not want his face on camera  he's the manager of an apartment complex in richmond where thieves broke into a  storage room and apartment and stole more than 30 oven doors and they're out 
[02:10:00]  on the streets they're packaging them as plasma tvs and they're out on the  street selling them selling them for hundreds of dollars to people who think  they're getting a great deal on a stolen plasma tv  so the guy's stealing oven doors oven doors and he's repackaging them to make them as plasma  televisions who's the dummy buying those why does it say microwave and popcorn and  yeah de-thaw how great is that workers uh shows how doors can be stolen in seconds as we continue 
[02:10:30]  here a maintenance worker for the building showed us how an oven door could be stolen in a matter of  seconds i heard of one person in any art bought a oven door thought it was a plasma tv for 375  dollars just recently thieves aren't just stealing from one apartment complex another building  nearby had dozens of oven doors stolen wait so what is the guy doing he's breaking into an  apartment breaking into apartments they're stealing the oven doors from what apartment 
[02:11:00]  they probably store them downstairs because the residents will have them break i'm sure so i'm sure  the owners will have like oven doors on hand all right so they're not going into individual  apartments no but they just figured out too probably does sound like they was going into  apartments so it's kind of did did it really new construction oh new construction probably too  okay by the way kenny's a lot of people saying that you're right  of course yeah if you jump up people saying that you're right the train will go under you  uh don't jump near a wall then smash right into it all right and finally sells the oven doors 
[02:11:30]  you want to buy an oven door door it's actually i sold a plasma tv and now they're they're dodging me  really fast or something unfortunately running out of show on this side reminiscent of the old vcr  scams of the 80s that anthony was just describing richmond police say the rocks in a box scam started in  the 80s when the vcr was a hot item scammers would put bricks into boxes and sell them as a vcr 
[02:12:00]  so this plasma tv scam is just a new twist but not everyone is sympathetic if a person thinks that  they are going to purchase a new plasma tv for three hundred dollars on a street corner  they basically deserve what they get you really don't get something for nothing or next to nothing  so i mean that's probably the lesson here i mean if it sounds like it's too good to be true  chances are it probably is we found a man who did not want to be on camera because he says he's not 
[02:12:30]  only heard of the rocks in a box scam but he did it but a lot of people fell for it yeah and they still  fall for it and just because i'm saying what i'm saying they're still gonna fall for it  you know this is waiting see oh boy was he one of the uh criminals it looks like the guys that were  pulling the skin uh jimmy cricket but you know why they get away with it because we all want to  believe you want to get that deal screen tv for what i'm gonna go to your pals and go hey you know 
[02:13:00]  what i did you know what i did i bought a plasma tv for 300 bucks yeah still in the box yeah look at  this thing it's beautiful for the big game want to be able to brag about it open it up in front of  your friends and they just start laughing they better laugh at you all right here's my oven door  i ordered and i'll go get the plasma be right back did your friends laugh at your other friend on the  job site or oh did we laugh it didn't stop it didn't stop how we laughed at him and it could have  been any one of us greedy bastards all right by the way i saw boss's baby i wanted to kiss his face 
[02:13:30]  what a beautiful baby he wouldn't let you wouldn't let me touch it because he said it's just you  have the first half weeks i worry about germs and stuff which is fine but what a beautiful baby  that's crap by the way i wanted it to be ugly and misshapen but it's just an adorable kid  the only way you build up an immune system in a kid is to get him exposed to as many germs as  possible you dip them in raw sewage so jimmy would have been perfect jimmy would have been perfect yes  that immune system would have went way up after your visit i want to kiss the little baby's 
[02:14:00]  knuckles little baby hands he rocks mouth all right we gotta get sucking toes we gotta get  out of here uh tomorrow night's the big show for everybody in the dc area of course the nissan  pavilion the only traveling virus comedy show go to virus tour one word on myspace for all the info  but uh basically it's gonna be an amazing show military id getting free right there's a lot of  military down here yeah military id gets in free tomorrow night at the nissan pavilion i guess  that's all we have to say today yeah if you're not joining us over at xm satellite radio 
[02:14:30]  have a great weekend  if the opie and anthony show opie and anthony live from washington dc  480 live from washington dc  thank you 
[02:15:00]  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  Why is this?  Well, it's black.  You'd be used to that.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Could you put a dress over this?  Right.  And a wig. 
[02:16:30]  What's up, everyone?  We've got a lively crowd in here.  Certainly do.  The last time I was in this room, I was with little Jimmy Norton.  We were watching, like, Robert Plant warm up.  It was just Robert Plant, a couple, like, studio musicians, and Jimmy and I in the front row, like, looking like chicks.  Like, we wanted to bang Robert Plant.  Yeah, that's where we got the photos with him, right outside this little door here.  Oh, yeah.  With his huge, oversized head. 
[02:17:00]  And his big cock bulge.  I don't know what he fucking has.  I think it's fucking Jimmy Page's arm.  What's that audio here?  Oh, Pal Talk.  Yeah, we got the Pal Talk camera set up, too.  Pal Talk.  Who's going to the virus show tomorrow?  Yeah, kids!  I figure we'll just ask questions.  They'll react.  They'll clap a lot.  They'll answer, honestly.  And then we'll get the hell out of here.  You know, we don't even have to do anything.  I can't believe the outpouring of women that have come. 
[02:17:30]  Once again.  Once again.  Let's take a look around.  A brave few.  And we are trying to, like, soften our delivery so we get a few more women out there that  we can bang.  Are we?  Are we trying to soften our delivery?  Just slightly.  The delivery of a slap to the ass, maybe.  Try to soften that, E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  You want an action photo of us talking?  Punched the girl in the asshole yesterday.  That'd be natural, right?  All right, go ahead.  That's it. 
[02:18:00]  I like his shirt.  It's great.  The flames.  That's the guy that fucked up our picture back in the day.  I can't believe you're still working here.  How do you still have a job?  He's still working here.  Great.  Oh, dude.  You're not going to have a job after the merger.  How do you pay for that camera?  Is it hard taking pictures and being married to Susan Sarandon?  Great. 
[02:18:30]  There it is.  Remember that first photo shoot of us?  We had back...  Oh, it has to be...  Almost...  Well, three years ago.  What about now?  Three years ago.  It sucked.  I had...  You in New York and did another one.  I had Ronald Reagan makeup on.  And you thought...  The makeup woman was some hippie chick.  And put, like, the Ronnie Reagan rosy red cheeks.  Looked like Reagan in the coffin.  And then Opie had giraffe neck. 
[02:19:00]  Because for some reason...  You're not getting a good picture from me.  Every picture...  Yeah, here it is.  Is it in color, though?  Travis?  Travis, everyone, if you've never seen him live.  He weighs about 95 pounds.  There he is.  Look at him.  Just broke his arm opening that door.  That's the giraffe neck picture that he thought was terrific enough to send out to, I don't  know, something called AP.  I got publicity.  Yeah, great.  We would have got publicity on our own. 
[02:19:30]  Medical anomalies.  The long neck.  Yeah, we'd have got publicity.  Dinosaur found.  Brontosaurus does radio.  Radio host eats apple while standing on the ground off tree.  While other one winks.  Hey, our...  No, what am I doing?  I don't know.  Joke coming.  We're doing car crash comedy today.  How many people are doing that with us today?  One guy.  Two guys?  Nah, I saw a couple there. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, just a couple?  Yeah.  All right.  A couple?  Yeah, let's see.  Now the hands go up a little more.  How many got, Thin?  Looks like we've got about ten guys.  Seriously?  Ten guys doing some comedy.  Are we going to start with that, or...  You need a little more time?  Oh, that means we have to improv.  Oh, boy.  This could be a problem.  I have to go off...  Could I have to sit back so open and I can see each other a little bit?  I can see.  Yeah, we can see.  I'm sitting forward.  No, because I have to lean forward for the microphone, so if we can move this mic back  here, I know that doesn't play on radio.  Oh, now there's all kinds of problems.  Well, I want to give you guys eye line with each other when you need it. 
[02:20:30]  Now there's problems.  Jimmy's never going to get respect.  Look at this.  And I got these huge boomers in front of us, and Jimmy's got this lame college radio mic.  Just put mine on the table.  I'll just lean down.  I'm shy.  I'll just put my chin above the table and talk.  Oh, sir, your leg is injured.  What happened?  What?  What happened to your leg?  I'm with a bum hip.  Oh, no.  A bum hip?  Why did you say that?  He was born with it.  Oh, you were...  Oh, okay. 
[02:21:00]  Do we have a wireless mic for these guys?  Accident.  I can't see.  I mean...  I know.  The sun is lighting us right now.  Are the lights bright enough in here, you think?  Why do they have that fucking, like, 1940s microphone in the middle?  Boy, we should all just keep improv-ing.  It's going so well.  It's like fucking McCartney's fucking Artist Confidential.  All right, we can.  You don't eat animals.  Go fuck your one-legged wife.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  It's going to be all right.  We're going to dance today.  You're going to dance.  She's going to hop up and down.  He's got to be one of the biggest pussy-whipped guys ever in the history of being pussy-whipped.  First of all, he turns vegetarian for the first wife, lets her sing in one of his bands,  like he just had some shit band that he's letting his chick sing.  He was in the fucking Beatles, and he lets his chick sing, turns vegetarian, and then 
[02:22:00]  he hooks up with the one-legged broad, who then takes him to the cleaners for money in  the divorce.  That is a pussy-whipped asshole.  He should just have his cock out all the time, and a big sign, I was a Beatle.  And girls just huddle.  I'd hold it over my head.  What was that stupid movie?  Oh, Say Anything, right?  Say Anything, with just Beatles tunes blasting out, and a big fucking heart on.  That's me.  With an arrow that says, yeah, that's me singing. 
[02:22:30]  Me singing, suck here.  My cock.  Suck that guy.  Or he should stand naked with a fucking hat on it with an obnoxious plastic yellow submarine  on top of the cap, and make them suck his dick and hum this, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Hey, getting ready for Car Crash Comedy, we do have the Master Poe outtakes we never played  yesterday.  Oh.  You guys all know who Master Poe is, right?  Yeah, Master Poe.  And Master Poe was in the puddle yesterday fixing your tire.  Changed my flat tire.  Yeah.  He goes, thank God, you're lucky, it's only flat on the bottom. 
[02:23:00]  Now, see if it, oh, if it rolled.  Well, he's kind of mad because of the hip-hop abs thing you were talking about last week.  I've watched this infomercial too many times.  I'm an infomercial junkie, TV junkie.  This hip-hop abs with this guy, and he's dancing around, and they have testimonials from women  and men talking about how hip-hop abs have made him lose the weight. 
[02:23:30]  And it just looks like the dumbest fucking thing you can do alone in your house watching.  If I'm alone in my house and I'm popping in a video, I'm jerking off.  That's pretty much it.  I'm not losing fucking weight.  Maybe I'm losing this much weight in white liquid.  But they have this hip-hop abs thing, and he's doing dance moves.  And he shows people how to do the dance moves, and it slims down your abs.  Yeah.  And Poe is pissed off at this guy because he stole my idea. 
[02:24:00]  Hoo-hoo.  He ripped me off.  He ripped me off.  I invented hip-hop abs.  Robin.  Hoo-hoo.  So he's all pissed off about that.  Well, we threw him in a studio to do some liners for the show, and then he started talking about  hip-hop abs and his idea, which is body rock or something like that.  Yes, he wanted to do body rock.  And I guess it worked so well in New Orleans, he said, and he wanted to make a tape.  There is not one thing that has ever worked well in New Orleans.  And I'm not just talking about our appearance. 
[02:24:30]  Sure.  I'm talking about the whole city.  God's weather plan.  Okay.  One thing.  Can we see into that booth?  No.  You got the audio?  All right.  When I point to you, you got to stop it, though.  Uh-oh.  All right.  We got Master Poe.  Yeah, we have to stop for jocularity.  Yeah, let's start.  Poe explains body rock.  Will the audience be able to hear this, too?  Yeah.  Through the speakers?  All right.  It better be.  All right.  Let's start up the clip there. 
[02:25:00]  That'll take a while.  I see somebody still holding the CD.  Oh.  Oh, that could be a problem.  Hey, Poe, if you're listening.  Spin it on your finger with a pin.  Poe, if you're listening, let your hair grow back.  He looks like a South Park character now with that round head.  It's really ridiculous.  Like we said yesterday, he looks like a tennis ball.  He is ludicrous.  He's a round-headed fool.  You got to have the right head for the old crew cut.  Like Jimmy, look.  See?  You do all right with your short hair. 
[02:25:30]  Thank you.  Everyone.  Oh, Jimmy.  Master Poe just looks fuzzy.  That's right.  All around.  People tell me I make love to the camera.  All right.  Can we play that now?  All right.  Let's try it again.  Here's Master Poe explaining body rock.  Body rock is fitness.  Like martial arts?  No, no.  Body rock.  No, body rock is dancing.  Remember what I...  Do you remember the recent... 
[02:26:00]  No, no, no.  Nothing like that.  You know body rock for abs?  I think that's what it's called.  Hip-hop, whatever that is.  When I looked at that, I was pissed because that's body rock.  And, you know, I'm slowing the jump.  That's body rock.  Do you have a copyright?  Well, body rock, I don't have a copyright, but it doesn't matter if I'm supposed to body rock or...  Do you have a patent?  No, no.  I have to get a patent.  And once I start the commercial, I'm going to have people go to these seminars. 
[02:26:30]  They're going to love it.  I can have a room filled with 200 women and they'll go crazy.  They'll go crazy.  I can put together a seminar, a dance seminar that they would love.  And when I looked at hip-hop abs, it really aggravated me because, you know, I should have done that a long time ago.  But that's something that I will do.  But first, I want to start doing the seminars.  Get a room filled with women. 
[02:27:00]  I can even do like 50 women.  And they'll go crazy.  The women.  That's it?  What are you talking about?  No problem.  Not quite done.  He pretty much invented it.  And he was pissed after he saw it.  Like, I felt the same way about the microwave oven.  I was like, damn, I should have thought of that.  Like, there's 10,000 things I look at and go, fuck.  Would have been great.  I could have been rich and an inventor. 
[02:27:30]  That's what he's doing.  He's just mad.  He's grandiose, too.  I'm going to fill Madison Square Garden with women.  And they're all going to dance and yell my name.  Women.  No guys.  I want guys to be all fat, so they only fuck me.  That's right.  Well, he kind of says that in his next clip.  He says, women love body rock.  He has changed thousands of lives with body rock.  Thousands of lives with body rock.  It's like a cult to Master Poe.  So, hit that.  I've never heard anyone say it this way. 
[02:28:00]  Drew Boogie told me, he says, you know, Master Poe, your body rock is addicting.  It's very addicting.  He's seen it.  He's seen it at my school.  I've just lost all credibility in Drew Boogie.  In my class.  And turning, twisting, splitting, doing all the steps of body rock.  And the women love it.  And now the music, this is the key here.  The music is all Drew Boogie's music.  Because anytime that you do something that's commercial, you can't have someone else's music. 
[02:28:30]  Exactly.  So, Drew Boogie gave me his songs.  And I practiced my routines with his songs.  Oh, my God.  His songs are incredible.  The remixes it does for us?  Oh, my.  No, not that.  This is extra stuff.  This is amazing, Eric.  I'm talking about stuff that you hear on the radio.  Without any vocal to it.  Amazing.  So, what I was doing is I was practicing that over and over and over and over again. 
[02:29:00]  And we got to get some signs.  The program itself is intense.  Women lose weight.  They tone their body.  Hey, I'll give you, for instance.  I'm about to shut that off for a second.  We're trying to be subtle.  Like, hey, I'd like you to shut it off so we could comment on it.  Yeah.  And then we just got to go, shut the fucking thing off.  Turn it off.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I want to say, I didn't know that was E-Rock interviewing Master Poets. 
[02:29:30]  It was almost, I confused it with the Frost-Nixon interviews.  It's just as brilliant.  Having these two chatting with each other.  Yeah.  Oh.  Just like the songs you hear on the radio, without the music and words.  It's incredible.  Phenomenal.  I dance to his routines.  I do my routines to his music.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go back to this clip.  We got to kind of sync up with you guys because we need to stop and comment, all right? 
[02:30:00]  I've saved millions of lives.  Yeah, the hand down means pause.  The program itself is intense.  Women lose weight.  They tone their body.  Here, I'll give you for instance.  Oh.  There are women that come to me with tears in their eyes and they say, you know.  That would be a stop right there.  Yes.  See, that's a good moment right there.  And then you back up like a couple seconds.  That's how we do it back in New York.  So back up the tape like two seconds.  And they say, how drunk was I last night when I fucked you? 
[02:30:30]  They come to Master Poe with tears in their eyes.  With tears in their eyes.  Tears in their eyes because the mace thing was backwards.  And they say, Poe, how do you wear a hat on that round head of yours?  Tears in their eyes, I guess, as he lines up for this last fuck.  All right, let's see why they have tears in their eyes.  For instance, there are women that come to me with tears in their eyes.  And they say, you know, Master Poe, I don't know how to thank you. 
[02:31:00]  Because now my husband gives me flowers.  He takes me to dinner.  He pays attention to me more.  What the fuck?  My husband gives me flowers because I'm dead.  Because you strangled me, you sociopath.  What the fuck, dude?  What do you think he is?  Takes me out to dinner.  It's like a hack aerobics exercise that he's changing women's lives.  He claims he invented that.  Well, fucking didn't Richard Simmons do that shit like 20 years ago? 
[02:31:30]  Poe, what are you talking about?  This is him actually going through what the infomercial would be like.  Oh, okay.  Like, you can see he's thought this out.  Like, that'll be good.  We'll have testimonials from women.  And they'll be crying going, Master Poe, thank you so much.  My husband now takes me out to dinner and gives me flowers and invites other women into our beds.  Let's see.  And then he says to me, get on the ride, you fat pig.  And I say, I don't want to get on the ride.  Does he have a gun?  Is he going to shoot me?  That's right. 
[02:32:00]  Sonny Wartick's wife came to me.  Thank you, three people older than 30.  Let's go back to the tape.  Now my husband gives me flowers.  He takes me to dinner.  He pays attention to me more.  And we, you know, we do things together a little bit more than before.  And, of course, she didn't get too graphic in detail.  But the fact is that I've actually changed hundreds, if not thousands, of people's lives in any different era. 
[02:32:30]  She didn't get graphic.  What did Paul expect?  You know, he does things like, he'll eat my cunt now.  He never did that before.  Thank you, Master Poe, for the aerobicizing.  My husband never fingered my ass and pulled out a lima bean skin.  But now he does, thanks to your aerobicizing kit.  Master Poe's body rock.  It is that I've actually changed hundreds, if not thousands, of people's lives in any different area that I have. 
[02:33:00]  So I'm reopening at school.  But on a second level, I'm also doing seminars.  He's doing what?  Seminars.  Seminars.  Seminars, gentlemen.  I don't like the fact that he said he's changed hundreds, if not thousands.  If not thousands.  If he's going to upgrade, he should say, I've changed no one's, maybe one person's life.  There's a big jump there, right?  Well, now he talks about the Bourbon Street thing.  Oh, when we were in New Orleans.  Well, when we were in New Orleans, he was our security back then. 
[02:33:30]  And he decided that we didn't need security.  He needed to work the streets of New Orleans.  And we were fine on our own.  We were up in a balcony somewhere throwing beads at people.  And he went downstairs on the street and started actually dancing with, now, it might be hundreds.  It might have been thousands.  I saw two.  I want you there, man.  And even in class, I don't want anything from you.  I just want you there.  I want you to be part of it.  I want you to see what I can do.  What I can actually do.  When I was in New Orleans, Steve told me to go down and have fun. 
[02:34:00]  I did.  I went down and I did body rock on the New Orleans street, on Bourbon Street.  And I had the shot glass ladies come out.  I had grandmothers come out.  I had cousins.  I had husbands.  Yeah, that was body rock.  You're doing body rock?  That was body rock.  The second biggest disaster in New Orleans.  My friend Katrina came out. 
[02:34:30]  What an awful selling point.  I had grandmothers and shot glass girls.  It was great.  A cousin showed up.  Wait till we get to the phone name game.  I preferred Levy Rock.  Okay.  Pardon me.  No, that was good.  That was good.  Are those hooked up yet?  Now, again, don't ask me where the O&A party rock came from.  I was just having a great time.  I was enjoying myself.  No.  Everybody said that I was drinking.  No, I wasn't.  I was on coffee, iced tea, and Coca-Cola. 
[02:35:00]  Because I stayed up all night.  I was taking care of Steve and I was taking care of the other guys.  I took.  Can I say that the true sign of idiocy is anyone who refers to Coke as Coca-Cola?  And, God damn, have an excuse.  Say you were drunk.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's why you were doing that.  I was only on caffeine and methamphetamines and Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.  And Royal Crown Cola.  All right, we get it.  We get it.  Hold on. 
[02:35:30]  Because I stayed up all night.  I was taking care of Steve and I was taking care of the other guys.  I took him back to his studio, to his place, his hotel, at 5 o'clock in the morning.  Now it gets sexy.  I was so jumpy.  I didn't know what to do.  So, I went back to my hotel.  I had Mongo, which gave me more sugar.  And I danced from 6 o'clock in the morning until 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  All right, so wait.  Hold on.  Holy shit.  Why did he have to bring Steve back to the hotel room?  This is a new little tidbit here.  So they could dance and have some Mongo.  Where's Steve?  What the fuck is Mongo? 
[02:36:00]  Here comes Steve.  Where's Steve?  It was great.  Here comes Steve.  He bought me a spritzer and then fucked my throat while I fell asleep.  Martini Steve, everyone, if you've never seen him live.  We watched the taste of each other's cum out of our mouths with Coca-Cola.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Why was he bringing you back to your hotel?  In New Orleans, that was when I was... 
[02:36:30]  No, no, as Paul would say, in New Orleans.  In New Orleans.  These gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Steve had to be brought back to his apartment because he was intoxicated and falling asleep  at the strip club.  So, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  No, that was when I was still enjoying the occasional half-dozen martinis.  I took them in my arms.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to say that's when I was still straight.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Paul had to take my inebriated, crippled ass back home to the hotel. 
[02:37:00]  He's carrying you like Richard Gere at the end of Officer and a Gentleman.  Yeah.  I really have no recollection of the evening other than to know that Poe was patting himself  on the back the entire day because he saved me.  Oh, well, of course.  Because apparently I would have gotten killed had I said something obnoxious.  All right.  There he is.  Did he rock your body?  I really hope not.  So, he brings you back to the hotel, you pass out, and then he dances the late morning,  early afternoon away by himself?  That's what he likes to do.  What a weirdo.  Yeah.  He's on the line, too.  We'll get to him in a second. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, God, Poe.  Let's go back to the tape.  All right.  Everybody's talking to me about this.  Mango.  We call it mango.  You want to call it mango, it's up to you.  But from six o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon.  Oh.  Mango the fruit?  It's mango.  He calls it mango?  What else did you have?  An apple or a grop?  Everyone else in the free world calls it mango, but I call it mango.  Then you're wrong.  I love that character in Blazing Saddles, mango. 
[02:38:00]  What are you talking about?  All right.  Hit that again.  Call it mango, it's up to you.  But from six o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon, I was...  I'm listening to you, but I'm saying...  Mango is a fruit.  So why are they called it mango?  That's because you're not Latino.  No, you're not Latino.  Latinos call it mango.  Any Latino would call it mango.  No, I'm serious.  They call it...  Mango.  Ask any Latino how you say mango. 
[02:38:30]  They'll look at you funny and they'll say it's mango.  Rob you.  Yeah, you said X, any Latino, and then talking about pronouncing something.  So from six o'clock in the morning until about two o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock  in the afternoon, whatever it was, I was dancing straight through.  I didn't stop.  Handing out stickers and enjoying myself before we started working.  How bad does someone's ball smell at Mardi Gras when they're dancing for eight hours after 
[02:39:00]  eating mango?  Like, mango.  All the sugar is trying to leave his body through his scrotum.  All sweaty balls.  Is he on the phone?  Yeah, you want to go to him now?  I don't want to go to him at all.  I'm frightened.  All right, let's...  He is a killer.  I don't even know if this is going to work.  It might.  Let's see.  Master Poe.  Hey, thank you.  Shit.  What's up, bro?  Good morning, guys.  What'd you have for breakfast?  A mango? 
[02:39:30]  Okay.  Are you enjoying listening to a recap of your conversation with E-Rock?  Yeah.  I don't know anything.  Uh-oh.  It wouldn't be fun if you knew he was taping.  Oh, he didn't know he was taping this?  Oh, I thought they were doing this into microphones.  Yeah, I thought you were having, like, you were pitching.  Yeah, we were doing Watergate stuff, man.  This is, you know, you unplugged there, Master Poe. 
[02:40:00]  I thought you were pitching a show, like an infomercial.  No, well, I was doing some lines for E-Rock, and I thought it was off.  I thought the recording was off.  But evidently, it wasn't.  Yeah, we're going to get into your lines.  You talk about free stuff, the Poe name game, and then you get pwned.  That's a laugh devoid of humor. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's just a huff sound.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, Poe.  All right, we'll talk to you soon.  Stay on hold.  We might have to go to you there.

[02:43:30]  What's the?  At the end of the Jersey thing.  What's that?  What is the?  I'm from New Jersey.  No.  Us.  Us.  That's the common thing when you're giving respect to someone.  You say goodbye and you say hello.  Why not just goodbye and hello?  So what does that mean?  Is it an Asian thing?  Is it an Asian thing?  A martial arts thing?  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  It's from Japan.  Us.  Yeah, you say us.  Us.

[02:46:00]  No, not really.  Not at all.  It's been too long.  Is that the end of that clip?  As soon as the weights went clang, it was soon enough.  All right, let's, um.  Screw him.  Here we go.  Stupid wrestler asshole.  Hey, this is Master Poe.  You have just heard Poe Ned.  What's that?  Poe Ned or Poe Ned?  Oh, that's one.  You've been Poe Ned. 
[02:46:30]  It was just reading what E-Rock wrote down.  Okay, we got to hear that again.  Ned.  What's that?  Poe Ned or Poned?  Oh, okay.  Hey, this is Master Poe.  You have just been pwned.  Pwned.  Oh, this is going to be hilarious.  Yes, it is.  Poe Ned. 
[02:47:00]  He probably thought it was like a character on a black station.  Hi, I'm Poe Ned.  Poe Ned.  Oh, this is going to be hilarious.  Hey, this is Master Poe.  You have just been pwned.  Damn.  You've just been.  Okay.  Damn.  You just got pwned.

Well, there you have it, Master Poe.  Wow.  What does pwned mean?  That's leet speak.  For like, you know, I just kicked your ass.  I've owned you. 
[02:48:00]  I made you look stupid.  You know, if you're playing a game online and some kid, you know, fucking Counter-Strike comes  up and blows your head off.  Oh, okay.  You've been pwned.  Yeah.  I'm glad I didn't know that.  I'll put it in something you can understand.  You're fucking some hooker, right?  Okay.  And you go to give the reach around to give her a little something, and you feel a set  of balls.  You've been pwned.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  That's the way I can describe it.  On a video game, when you're pwned, do you also have to pay extra?  Sorry.  And I should have given you an example of something you would have found bad or offensive.  Right.  Let's go back to Master Poe.  Poe.  You have anything else to...  Seems like I've been pwned.  Anything you want to say?  Oh, pwned.

It's Opie and Anthony live from XM7.

[02:50:00]  Hello.  Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Hello.  All right.  We're back at XM.  Satellite radio in the compound.  Anyone see a rat yet?  Anyone see a rat?  Supposedly there's a lot of rats in this compound.  You can see the rat traps on the way out.  Oh, lots of rat traps.  Yeah, you can see them.  All right.  Filling back in.  The contestants, some of the contestants  For Car Crash Comedy  Were outside 
[02:50:30]  Are you guys all coming in, not contestants?  They took half our audience away  Well, who asked you to sit outside?  Oh my god, please  Please, God, say Don Wicklin  Please, Jesus, God  Make them say  We've been too nice to Don so far  On this visit  What happened?  Sam?  Oh, Sam  I was telling these guys during the break  I thought we were sucking so bad  That people were actually leaving us  You don't want a live audience to leave ever  Oh, I know 
[02:51:00]  It wasn't my idea  Ladies and gentlemen, Sam  If you haven't seen him live yet  And of course  We just wanted to get you on the stage  To find out what did you have for dinner last night  Do we have Sam's music?  Did we bring Sam's music down to Washington?  Of course, you guys know that Sam eats like an 8-year-old, right?  Who has 8-year-olds out there? Anybody?  See, we're getting a couple of hands  Jimmy's had a few 8-year-olds  And you guys have 8-year-olds  Uh, nothing 
[02:51:30]  Alright, well, fuck  Something  That's not perfectly timed  That was a good visual  Alright, Sam  Do we have his music?  No Sam music  Of course not  Alright, go ahead, Sam  See, that's why I need all  What?  That's why I need my buttons in front of me  Oh  Sam, go ahead  Go ahead, Sam  What did you have for dinner?  Now you're on the road, so 
[02:52:00]  Yeah  Well, last night we went to Ruby Tuesdays, a bunch of us  Oh, there's Sam's music  That'll work  Yeah, a bunch of us went to Ruby Tuesdays  And so, I had a  They didn't have  I got a Mr. Pibb  Instead of milk  Because I was on the road  What's a Mr. Pibb?  It's like Dr. Pepper  But better  And they don't have it in New York  So  Because it's faggot beverage  Mr. Pibb?  Yeah, Mr. Pibb  Mr. Pibb  Yeah  Mr. Pibb, why don't you sit down right there? 
[02:52:30]  I'm Chris Hanson  With Dateline NBC  Pibb is an abbreviation for penis in backside  And then, for the main course, I had their appetizer sampler  Which is, it's a combination platter of chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, and cheese fries  No vegetables, no salad  Why do I ask?  Of course not 
[02:53:00]  We don't have to ask anymore  And what about dessert?  I didn't have dessert because we were Ruby Tuesdays  And I don't really get dessert when I go places  Why?  I don't know  That's where you get the best dessert  Because I go and I eat at places that make your, like  Make the food sink to the bottom of your stomach  And I never save room  Oh, you don't save room?  No, I just fill up on chicken fingers and cheese fries  How much room could you have?  Not that much, that's the point  I never save room  I fill up on a chicken finger  What did you have for breakfast? 
[02:53:30]  Pepsi  Pepsi  Pepsi cola  Yeah, the Pepsi cola  Coca-Cola  Yes  Yes  Yes  Just Pepsi  Just Pepsi so far?  Oh yeah  There was all that food out there  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  I went in that room and had a bagel with nothing on it except some sesame seeds  And a piece of watermelon and a Diet Coke  Because they didn't have regular Coke  It's called a sesame bagel  Yeah, it's not a bagel with sesame seeds on it  It's acting like you sprinkled them on discreetly at your leisure 
[02:54:00]  Did you have the mini bagel?  No, no, it was a full-size bagel  Oh, you passed on the mini bagels  I didn't see any mini bagels  Of course you would have had one of those  All right, Sam, everyone  There you go  Yes, Sam  I think we're ready for Car Crash Comedy  Yes  Dan's going to help us out with Car Crash Comedy  The rules are very simple  We got, what, ten contestants?  Correct  They got to last two minutes, I believe  Yes  It's either they last two minutes or they get off the stage  Because we hit the Car Crash sound three times  Three strikes and you're out 
[02:54:30]  Wow  Sure sounds odd, but it's effective  It really does sound odd  Yeah  Why is that so muffled?  It's out of phase or something  I don't know  Like the initial screech part is very low  But the crash is very loud  Yeah, listen  Dude  Ow  Yeah, that's a little weird  Yeah, why is that sound?  Can we fix that or no?  No, of course not  Probably not  All right  All right, ladies and gentlemen  Why should we?  Why is that sound so muffled?  So we say it  And of course the winner of Car Crash Comedy  Will open up tomorrow night 
[02:55:00]  At the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show  Yes  At the Nissan Pavilion  Than, take it away  All right  Thanks for the thumbs up, Sam  All right  Teasing, of course  I know  I wrote 20 minutes, too  I'm your biggest fan  Cool  Hey, everybody  Welcome to Car Crash Comedy  Yes

All right  Thanks for being a good sport  Energy's important in comedy  I know that  So thanks for helping  Yeah  Yeah, that isn't very loud  Makes me feel better  Cool  Well, I'm going to warm you guys up  Because you guys just need to be brought up to a fever pitch  And that's what I do 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I'm originally from Connecticut  Nobody cares  Yeah, Sam cares  Thank you  Not a very diverse place  The motto for my local country club was  By the year 2015, we'll have a Jew  That got a titter, sir  Let's not jump the gun  I'm not sure if that means they're going to have a Jewish member 
[02:56:30]  Or they'll have captured one  But they are hell-bent on getting one  Did I make it to two minutes?  I forgot to time myself  I got a laugh, so I'm going to end on that  You guys ready for your first contestant?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  What's wrong, Jimmy?  That was your warm-up?  Yeah  Well, I got to do a mini  One joke  I got to do a miniaturized set  Because everybody's going quickly today  One Jew joke and he's off

[02:57:30]  Doing me a great job  What's up, guys?  What's up?  I came all the way down from Jersey today  I'm from Jersey  I'm proud to be from Jersey  Only because whenever I travel a lot  People are like, where are you from?  And I just say, Jersey  Think about it  It's the only state that begins with the word new  That you can just drop the new from  And people still know what you're talking about  Like, you can't do that with other states  Like York or Hampshire  It sounds fucking gay, right?  Like, even worse  What if you said, like, Mexico?  Like, which one?  The old one or the new one? 
[02:58:00]  Like, I have a question about New Mexico  Based on the original Mexico  Who thought it would be a good idea  To make a new one?  Like, don't they know  The sequel is never better than the original?  And the original kind of sucked to begin with  But I always wonder about, like, New Mexicans  Do they try to sneak into surrounding states  And steal jobs, too?  But, like, because they're New Mexicans  They'd be, like, taller  Smarter  Faster  Greasier  Be, like  Mexicans version 2.0 
[02:58:30]  Like, the preview for it would be, like  From the people who brought you Mexicans  Coming to a Home Depot near you  New Mexicans  Mexicans version 2.0  This time with citizenship  I was just hanging out with a buddy of mine the other day  He lives in an apartment building  This hot chick, really hot chick  Walks out  And I'm like, dude  Who's a chick?  And he's like, that's not a chick, dude  That's a tranny  I was like, oh, shit  I was like, alright  This girl walks up  She's like, hey  How you doing? 
[02:59:00]  My name's Ice Cream  I'm like, hi  Nice to meet you  He's like, what's your favorite kind of ice cream?  I was like, uh  The kind that doesn't have any nuts in it  So, guys  Anybody here from  You guys are from Jersey, right?  Jim, you from Jersey?  Been through Jersey at all?  Lately?  You're kidding, right?  I don't know  I was hoping two minutes was up  That's it?  Alright, yeah  Thanks, you guys  It's been great  Nice job  Hey, you doing alright again?  You doing alright?  Trying to work the crowd behind him 
[02:59:30]  And, uh  Let me say  I mean, you were great  In Psycho  I had that look  Well, the crowds seemed to like him  That was Rob  Stats  Manzatti  That was  That was Francis  From Stripes  Yeah  He did alright  Alright, the next comedian  In Car Crash Comedy  Alright, coming from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania  Let's hear it for Adam Nystrom  Thank you, sir 
[03:00:00]  If I gas up here, I apologize  But ever since I signed up for this thing  I've been so nervous  My asshole sounds like a dorm at Virginia Tech  Thank you, Jimmy  I wasn't going to do it  I've been working in a medical environment  For quite a while  You meet some interesting people  The other day 
[03:00:30]  This 92-year-old inpatient  Who's in a wheelchair  Stands up  And starts taking down her underwear  I said  Man, what's the problem?  She says  It's too tight  I said  Sweetheart, the last time  Anything's been tight around there  FDR was doing fireside chats  Okay  You develop a strong stomach, though  One time  I had an inpatient shit herself  Right in the bed  I thought  No big deal  I pull up  Her nightgown  It looks like Roger Clemens  Beans someone with a Kit Kat bar 
[03:01:00]  What else do we got here?  Funny, funny  I was an altar boy for quite a while  I grew up a nice Catholic kid  And I feel kind of slighted  Because  All these victims  Are getting cuts of these lawsuits  And everything  Don't shit for me  Nothing  Not molested  Not even so much as groped 
[03:01:30]  So I said  You know what?  I'm going to convert to Islam  Because either me with the virgins  Or the people I bomb  Someone's getting fucked  Okay  That's about it  Let me  Wow  Wow  He's failing  I got to say  The problem with it  I like where the jokes are coming from  It's a disgusting place  Yeah  But I like it  I like that type of humor 
[03:02:00]  But it was a little too much of like  The set up  Just to get to like a comparison  But that will change with time  If you keep doing it  Oh  Look at Jimmy giving you some advice  You should build a motherfucker  I like  I like that  Virginia Tech line  That was a great one to open with  That and Clemens  Oh yeah  And you're attacking the elderly  And massacred innocent people  I mean  That's good stuff  Look out Leno  If I could quickly just say to the comics  You're going to get one minute 
[03:02:30]  And then this means you have about  10 seconds  15 seconds  Just so you know  Sorry to do that on air  But you kind of have to  Well the signal  Let me tell people what you did  For the radio  Stan put up his pointer finger  Did a little whirling  And I don't know why you had to explain that  Like I didn't want you to think  I was making a proclamation  And then the whirly bird  Means wrap it up  Yes  10 seconds  Alright  You guys ready for your next act  Let's hear it  Let's hear it for Brian Jett  Alright 
[03:03:00]  What's going on everybody  Alright  Thank you for the opportunity gentlemen  I'm going to start off by explaining  Why I walk with the crutch  You know  I walk with the crutch  Because I was born with a permanent  And degenerative bone disease  My bone disease is called  Polyosotic fibrous dysplasia  And it is significantly weak in my hip  Which is interesting for me  Because now  When I make love to an elderly woman  I have to listen to my pelvis snap 
[03:03:30]  And that's a nice way  To start your morning really  There's a  There's a disabled celebrity  That I absolutely can't stand  And that's mini me  Fuck him  I can't wait until that little dude dies  You know  And it's going to be soon  Because he's not in the best of health  Really  You know  I can't wait to hear that shit on the news  You know  Tragic news today  The actor who plays mini me  Vern Troyer  Was killed last night  After he was caught  And then eaten  By an owl  It's very sad  I just want to kidnap him 
[03:04:00]  And like  Paint little whiskers on his face  And staple mouse ears to his head  And like  Kick him into a pit of snakes  You know  Have fun filming another  Shitty Geico commercial  From the inside of a python  You obnoxious little  Half a motherfucker  That was the  Princess die of my act anyway  I'm not worried about it  I want to talk about my ex-girlfriend real quick  My ex-girlfriend and I broke up  Right around the last election 
[03:04:30]  We were arguing a lot  Going back over politics  You know  She's a very liberal  Left wing democrat  And I'm not a whiny little faggot  You know  And she wanted us to vote together  So we wouldn't cancel each other's votes out  You know  She's like  Let's vote together  Make it count more  I was like  Oh sweetie  That is so cute  That is so cute  The way that you think  I'm going to let you vote  That's adorable  She  She wasn't all that bad though 
[03:05:00]  She  One time I had a really rough week on the road  And I came home  And she could tell I was tense  And she's like  Sweetie  Would you like a back massage  I said  Yes please  She's like  Would you like lotions  Absolutely  So I took off my shirt and laid down  And the lotion bottle was sort of empty  You know  So she was pulling one of these numbers  You know  Trying to get the last little bit of it out  And then all at once  It just  Just all came out  Right on the small of my back  And I remember thinking  Huh  I always wondered what that would feel like  Well you know  I mean  As an adult  Anyway 
[03:05:30]  Thanks kids  I  I  I  These guys are surviving  I know  They're not getting the three car crashes  I do want to point something out too  It's funny  That old Cheerio hips  Was  It was funny  Because he said something about liberals  Being whiny faggots  And the joke didn't get a laugh  But I didn't want them crashing  And Ant didn't crash  Yeah  I was like  Nah that's alright  I just agreed  Good point  Good point  Alright 
[03:06:00]  Let's keep the show trucking right along  Huh  Coming to the stage  From Woodbridge, Virginia  Let's hear it for Anthony Taylor  How's everybody doing?  Good  Somebody's doing real good back there  I do a lot of jokes  But I also do a lot of imitations  And  My favorite imitation to do  Is the Elmo imitation  And it's because  It gets me a lot of places 
[03:06:30]  And it gets me a lot of things  The first situation is with females  I'm a shy guy  So  If I see a group of females  Standing in a circle at the club  And you know  They're standing around  Talking about their hair  And their nails  And what they did over the weekend  I just bust up in the middle of them  Hi ladies  When I'm going to be drunk enough  Or desperate enough  To want to take Elmo home  And that's when they meet naughty Elmo  Who's your puppet?  Who's your puppet?  Okay, terrific  Alright  Second situation 
[03:07:00]  Ordering Chinese food  Maybe you like this one a little bit better  I get Chinese food free  Every time I order it  I call them up  They're like  Carry out a delivery  Delivery?  And they don't really catch it at first  So they ask me what I want  I'm like  Crab wangoon  Shrimp fried rice  Beef and broccoli  About this time they cut me off  Well you cannot order  You're too young  I'm probably  We don't  God  No  No  Oh my  I've told you something  How does that not go in?  Enough of the fucking Elmo

[03:09:30]  Right  If you go to another country  Like you go on vacation  You go to another country  Never get a drink  That has that country's name in it  Because you may not make it back  You know what I'm saying  Like if you go to Jamaica  There's the Jamaica Rewinder  And then there's the Hawaii Sidewinder  And then there's the Aruba Never Finder  Too early for that one there  I got Katrina jokes later  We'll even that show up  That's what's up 
[03:10:00]  Hey you guys gamble  We got gamblers in here  Texas Holdings  I like to play man  My favorite though  Is blackjack  And I love blackjack  But what I hate about blackjack  Is when you get dealt  Like right off  You get a dealt to 17  Like a 9  And an 8  I call that the ex-wife hand  Because you really want to hit it  But it's probably not a good idea  You guys know her?  You know what's going on there?  You know what that's bad? 
[03:10:30]  It's good stuff  I get mad at stuff  I get mad at people  When they come to my door  And mess with me out of the door  Like the Mormons  And the Jehovah's Witnesses  And stuff  And so I always try to do something  To make sure that they don't come back  To remember you  You can't just be an asshole  Because they have love in their heart  And they'll come back anyway  You know what I'm saying?  So you've got to leave an impression  So this is what I do  When they come to the door  I just take my pants off  And I have just my boxers on  Right?  I let my stuff just hang out  In front of the boxers  You know what I'm saying?  Not the whole thing  Because that's weird  It's just the head  You know what I'm saying?  Just a little bit 
[03:11:00]  And then I go open the door  And make sure to have stuff  In my hands  Right?  And I just open the door  And they stand there staring  And they're like  What the hell?  I'm like  Oh yeah  Could you tuck that in for me?  Come on there  Use two hands  What would Jesus do?  For real?  Hey let's go fall back out  Tuck it in there  Come on now  So thank you very much  So I'll take some tagalongs  And some do-si-dos  I'll give you one on that  I am basing this on fan reaction too

Milk is almost three dollars a gallon  For three bucks a gallon  I'll ride around on a cow  I'll just get a carrot  Tied to the end of a stick  And just fucking go around on that  Get 40 moves to the gallon  You were just waiting for that  I think like  If gas prices get any higher  They should have  Gas stations should be forced 
[03:30:30]  To have sales  Like department stores  Like Macy's has  Two day Tuesdays or something  Gas stations should have  Turban Tuesdays  Anybody who comes in  Rocking a turbine  Gets a 15% discount  On their purchase  It's like your girlfriend  Gets up in the morning  Comes out to shower  With a towel on her head  You're like  Babe before you take the towel off  Go down to the gas station  And fill up the tank for me  It's Tuesday  Wow you guys are killing me  Alright I'll finish with this  I work at a gym  Personal trainer  I was reading a magazine  It said  New addiction plagues American men 
[03:31:00]  It said it's worse than  Drug abuse  Alcoholism  Gambling  So I flipped the page  To see what it is  It said masturbation  It said the average American male  Masturbates like three times a week  And I was actually excited  When I read that  Because I finally scored  Above average on something  You think like  If it's worse than like  Drug abuse  Alcohol and gambling  They have like  Group therapy for that  Could you imagine  What like  Group therapy for  Masturbators Anonymous  Would be like  Like some dude  Walks up to me  And he's like  Hi my name's Jeff  I'm a chronic masturbator  I don't know about you  But I'm not shaking  That dude's hand  I'm not gonna shake it

This is a look into Kenny's life by the way  Doesn't get much better than this  I hung up  It's one  Who was it?  Awful conversation after another  It was  It was  Another cop  Yeah  Oh  You want to brag about something bad he did? 
[03:40:00]  Probably  He's asking will you keep the phone books in the station  There you go  All right  So Danny asked you guys some questions, right?  What were the questions?  Does anyone know?  Because Danny had a flight to L.A.  So we have no clue  Huh?  Sexual fantasy  Sexual fantasy?  And uh  Sexual fantasy and your biggest secret  You won't tell your partner  Biggest  Sexual fantasy, biggest secret  You won't tell your partner  Okay  Why did I repeat this?  I don't know  I'm tired  Okay so should we pick one? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah  Of course  Yeah  Here we go  It's going to be saucy  Try to figure out who this is  Oh my god  It's like a  Jesus  Oh it's like a fantasy  There you go  All right it's a fantasy  That's  And it's girl writing  Bit of a wimpy story  But I thought Jimmy  Might like to know  There are ethical massage therapists  Uh  No Jimmy wouldn't  I've never told anyone 
[03:41:00]  That I got propositioned  By an amazingly hot  40 year old client  Total California tan  And hot dancer  Pilates body  I just didn't know  How to accept the offer  What would I need to charge  Especially when I do it for free  There's only one way  To get to the bottom of this  You have to jerk me off  Well this is a tough question  Because what  This might  I'm assuming this is a woman 
[03:41:30]  But this could be a 40 year old guy  This could be a guy too  Writing this  Because it could be a male  Massage therapist  Who had a 40 year old  Dancer in Pilates  I don't know how much  You're charged for that  I'm guessing you'd ask  For an extra hundred  You don't have a  Sound advice  Yeah  By Jim  Wow  Normally like  Like when I'm  Trying to get jerked  I'll always say something like  I try to be coy  You know I'm just so not subtle  I'm like  You know I can be generous  That's the key word 
[03:42:00]  Generous  And they'll go  Oh that's nice  And I'll go  You know we can maybe  Help each other out a little bit  And they go  What do you mean  I'm like come on man  What a hack I am  I fucking did that  Guess where I'm going with this  And I went the other way  And I'm looking up  Like I'm really talking to someone  Because I'm trying to improv  Without bombing  Anyone want to admit to this  Who wants to admit to this  Who was a guy  Oh wait so you're  Alright 
[03:42:30]  A male massage therapist  So what happened  You were massaging somebody  While wearing sneakers  He was touching me  He was touching Kenny  He's used to just touching people  He couldn't help himself  Yeah you can't win here  Cool so what happened  You were massaging somebody  With sneakers  While rubbing them back and forth  Quickly on the carpet  Just doing my job  And out of nowhere  It was  You know she'd sort of  Hinted around  Sort of what you would do  Jimmy  And then she said  Let's go fuck  So what was the issue 
[03:43:00]  It's really not my thing  Are you gay  No  But I just figured  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Hold on  Hold on  You're going too fast  She said let's fuck  I said it's not my thing  I say are you gay  You say no  I don't understand  How that  He's a fake  You know it's all of a sudden  All those sort of ethical things 
[03:43:30]  You've done your whole life  All of a sudden  You know you're just like  I can't do this  That's not right  Ethical  But that's not unethical  Was she retarded  No  Were you massaging her big tongue  No but then I started  But then I started thinking  In the back of my mind  Maybe I would do it  But what could I charge  Like if I'm really going to go ahead  And throw the morals out  Like do I ask for ten thousand  No  Ten thousand  You're throwing the morals out  The fuck do you think you are  Ten thousand  Jesus  I know you might want to ask  For a comb or a brush  Oh there 
[03:44:00]  Therein lies the ethics problem  That's not ethical though  If you would have fucked her for free  You're just a person  Fucking another person  It's when the money comes into it  So you shouldn't have asked her  For anything  Right  You should have just fucked her  Yeah but I would have liked the money  Oh boy  You ain't very greedy sir  So just fucking kill her  And take her purse  I don't know  Yeah if you fuck her  And take money  You're then a prostitute  You're a filthy whore 
[03:44:30]  Right  And then there's your ethical problem  Absolutely  If you just fuck her  Then you're being  What they call a guy  Well said  Alright let's do another one  We gotta wrap up  Cause they want Ron and Fez  To get set up nicely  Yes  Ron and Fez  I mean you know  We'll do a couple more  And then we'll get out of here  Here we go  Come on  Here we go  Make it a doozy  Secret fantasy  I'm a female  Who'd like to be 
[03:45:00]  In a threesome  With a boyfriend  And other girl  At the bunny ranch  And then there's a little drawing  Of a little bunny  Over there  Or a double-tailed sperm cell  If you turn it upside down  You sick freak  Wow okay  A threesome  Let's look for a girl  That looks like  She'd be into a threesome

[03:46:00]  Well with my boyfriend  With your boyfriend  Oh I thought you meant  With a boyfriend and girlfriend  So your boyfriend  Right  And some other girl  Right  Now you've  Now the bunny ranch makes sense  Because you can just fucking leave  And your boyfriend's not gonna  You know  Leave  You  For this other girl  Right  So she's thinking ahead  Is the boyfriend here  No  Where is he  He's traveling across the country right now  Oh boy  On his way to Vegas  Exactly  Oh shit  Well that's what I told him  I said you know 
[03:46:30]  You could stop in Vegas  And I could meet you there  You had a twosome  With your picture on the dresser  Hopefully that suffices baby  I don't know about that  That's what I gotta do  So where did this fantasy go  Where does he come from  You kind of  You know  You've been thinking about  Well like I always wanted  To have a threesome  But um  Is it more because  You kind of want to be with a girl  Or you want to see your husband  With another girl  What part of the threesome  Makes you like  The most hot  Uh the girl part I think  You being with another girl 
[03:47:00]  Yeah  You ever done that  Nope  Never  Nope  You ever have a close encounter  Maybe in school  Something like that  So you're just kind of  A closet lesbo  No  No  But it turns you on  And the thought of your boyfriend  Being there  Right  What do you fantasize about  When you fantasize about a girl  You obviously masturbate  Thinking about a girl  What do you think about  Kissing her  Or tasting her  No  Like uh  I guess oral sex  Going down on her  Or her going down on you  Or both  No  Her going down on me  Really  You don't think about  Tasting her  What  What  Oh you don't want to do that

[03:49:00]  While having sex with a hooker  Her head was too close to a candle  And the hairspray in her hair  Ignited  Lighting her head on fire  I spent 45 minutes  Consoling  A crying  Cracked out  Hooah  Wait now  You were giving  He was giving her anal  And her hair caught on fire  Yeah  That is a fucking rodeo ride  That should just be  Part of a rodeo  Where you gotta hold on  For 8 seconds 
[03:49:30]  As her head's burning  What an ego boost  A fucking girl  All of a sudden  Her head is burning  I hate that shit  Her head exploded  Awesome  I fucked her on fire  Look at that shit  Do you want to add to that  Or you want to just stay anonymous  Come on  Where is old road flare  Cock  Ah  Alright  The man in the striped shirt  Yeah  It was  Wow  A rather odd situation  Yeah  She  Probably about 45 years old 
[03:50:00]  Smoked crack in the bathroom  Just beforehand  Yeah  And  Class act  She literally  Just dropped to the floor  And started crying  It was a little  A little awkward  Yeah  Now  What were you doing  With a crack whore  It was about  4.30 in the morning  And like this gentleman said  Cheaper  And  Before Craigslist  Before Jimmy  Turned me on to Craigslist  Thank you  Wow  Plug  So you found her on the street  And  No  She was an escort  Escort  So you call up 
[03:50:30]  She comes over the house  She does crack like  She goes into the bathroom  Right there  So you know what she's doing  She's polite enough to ask  Oh that's nice  Yeah  That's a polite crack whore  So then she comes out  And  Did you just instantly  Start dogging her in the ass  Or  But  Ten dollars extra  Oh  Ten dollars  Jesus  Yeah  Ten bucks for the asshole  She drives a hard bargain  So did you ask for that  Or were you doing that  And like  Fucking her in the pussy  Or getting a blowjob  And you said  I was getting a blowjob

[03:51:30]  Because they're just  They don't know it at first  So they're  They're all smiling  And their hair is on fire  Well it's kind of like  When a sock lights on fire  And it just spreads  And kind of hit the back  And kind of went around  She didn't catch it  Until it hit the bangs  And then she realized  And just dropped to the floor  It's like when a sock  Who the fuck knows  What a sock looks  Could you have picked  A better example  You know  A burning sock  We've all seen them  Yeah you've burnt  Burn the lint off the sock  I don't know  Alright  That's it 
[03:52:00]  I have one  That's fantastic  Okay  Guy that lived across the street  Wanted me to suck his hog  And dress in a diaper  For a Star Wars poster  When I was 12  I ran out of the house  And kicked his ass  When I was 21  Now let me see  If I recognize you  Don't look in the mirror  That's obviously a kid  Who an older man
