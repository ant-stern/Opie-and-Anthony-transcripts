<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show, broadcast number 30, was a whirlwind of topics, punctuated by their characteristically crude humor and frequent tangents.  The show began with a lengthy airing of grievances against Sirius XM management ("Washington").  Anthony, particularly incensed by poor phone systems, delayed office construction, and frustrating communication, unleashed a torrent of profanity ("shit in their hat," multiple "f" words) during a phone call with management. Opie, distracted by personal family issues, largely left Anthony to handle the fallout.  This led to a discussion on balancing creative freedom with corporate constraints, employing humorous analogies like dressing a monkey.

The frustration with management transitioned into a satirical review of the New York Post's coverage of Yasser Arafat's death and a scathing critique of Howard Stern's complaints about a gag order on his Sirius show, juxtaposed with Stern's past attempts to silence Opie and Anthony and other radio personalities.  The hosts recounted specific instances of Stern's alleged interference with management.  Listener feedback, both positive and negative (with an emphasis on the latter's greater memorability), and a news piece from Channel 9 about the show were also mentioned.  Jimmy Norton was present in the studio throughout this section, contributing to the conversation along with unnamed producers and possibly other staff.  A U2 song was played, and the segment concluded with further jabs at Howard Stern, a mention of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, and continued complaints about management.

The show then shifted to a furious condemnation of UPN 9's heavily edited broadcast of their show, which misrepresented their content to imply a focus on underage sex.  Clips of the edited news teasers and the aired segment were played to highlight the manipulative editing. This segued into another attack on Howard Stern, whom they called a "fucking scumbag" for allegedly underpaying Billy West and Jackie "the Joke Man," blaming this for damaging the show's success. The hosts discussed their current low listenership on XM Satellite Radio, hindering their ability to attract A-list guests, reviewing a potential guest list ranging from George Clooney to Green Day,  and sharing humorous anecdotes about past interactions with celebrities, including Michael Winslow’s reaction to an impromptu sex act and Jerry Seinfeld's aversion to unwanted physical contact.

A significant portion focused on Michael Jackson's phone call to Geraldo Rivera, thanking him for support amidst the child molestation allegations and Eminem video controversy.  Opie and Anthony expressed their disgust for Jackson and speculated on Geraldo's motives, suggesting a pursuit of exclusive access.  The segment included numerous crude jokes and offensive comments about Jackson and the allegations. A caller, Jamie, criticized the show, prompting a discussion about listener reactions.  The segment ended with further commentary on the UPN 9 edit and future guest speculation.


Further discussion of Michael Jackson dominated a subsequent segment, delving into the debate over the racism in the Eminem video and Jackson's alleged reliance on black militant leaders for support.  The conversation, filled with racial slurs and graphic sexual descriptions,  frequently veered into tangents about Johnny Cochran's illness, Geraldo Rivera's motivations, and Eminem's success.  The hosts discussed playing new U2 and Johnny Cash songs, highlighting difficulties with song selection.  "Master Poe," the show's security guard, featured prominently due to the presence of Old Dirty Bastard outside the studio, with a humorous description of Poe containing him with duct tape.  Other topics included TV stations refusing to air the unedited *Saving Private Ryan*, a caller's story about unequal media coverage of a black woman's twin birth versus a younger white woman's, and a lengthy, potentially fabricated phone call with Fred and Ashley, claiming to be having sex in Ashley's parents' bedroom.  The segment concluded with discussion of the popularity of the "Monster Rain" song.


The show continued with more "Monster Rain" songs from "Imaginary Bill" and "Pappy," both featuring graphic and sexually suggestive lyrics. A significant portion involved a prank call from Ashley and Janice (and Fred) pretending to be a mother and daughter, with Ashley falsely claiming an orgasm during a previous call as a "positive women's promo."  The hosts initially fell for it before realizing the hoax, leading to a discussion of their deception and listener reactions. Jim Norton then provided comedic storytelling about dining alone, humorous restaurant encounters ("Napkin Tommy" and "Dessert Before Dinner Danny"), and his preference for tattooed women, transitioning into discussion of psychedelic experiences and the absurdity of daily life.  A planned segment on the *Grand Theft Auto* lawsuit, intended as a “benchmark bit,” was derailed by Opie's interruptions, leading to frustration and discussion of the ruined bit's potential comedic value.  The show also included a conversation with "Old Dirty," characterized by vulgar commentary on crime, personal experiences, scams, drug use (Viagra and heroin), Bill Maher's palimony lawsuit, and Kevin Straley's ESPN2 appearance.


The show concluded with a segment heavily focused on unusual sexual preferences and body odors. Opie, Anthony, and "Old Dirty" engaged in explicit conversations about armpit licking, vaginal odor, and attraction to certain body smells, including detailed descriptions and anecdotes.  They discussed the quality of Brazilian sex reassignment surgeries and speculated on the lack of regulation. A caller, Jim from Tennessee, contributed to the discussion, and other callers shared humorous and off-color anecdotes. Opie's previous story was briefly referenced as a parallel. The segment ended with an XM Satellite Radio commercial discussing college basketball broadcasts.

[00:05:30]  I've got news for you. 
[00:06:00]  You are mine now.  Take out the papers and the trash.  Or you don't get no spending cash.  If you don't scrap that kitchen floor, you ain't gonna rock and roar no more.  And he wants to be president of the United States of America.  Change the law, change the law, change the law, change the law, change the law, change the law so I can be president.  Look at me wrestling with the deficit. 
[00:06:30]  This country is so effed up, it's not even funny.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  I'm just commenting.  Feel how soft my skin is.  Feel how soft my skin is.  No, I'm not gonna do that.  I'm a police officer.  Ah, I'm a cop you idiot.  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, Anthony.  Good morning to you, little Jimmy Norton.  Hi, boys. 
[00:07:00]  This is our 30th show on XM Satellite Radio.  30?  30th show.  My, my.  We like to call it the ONA virus, spreading across America slowly but surely.  Like the Herp.  The first high-profile radio show to go to satellite radio.  Yeah.  And we are loving it, Anthony.  Absolutely loving it.  Oh, yeah.  Should we start the show by kissing Washington's ass so everyone can be happy today and not take things personally?  Want to thank you personally, Opie? 
[00:07:30]  What?  For bowing out of a responsibility yesterday?  Well.  Leaving it all up to your pal, Ant.  I think at this point, the faithful listeners of this show understand everyone's roles on this show and know your role.  And for some reason, I take a lot of the phone calls and meetings behind the scenes.  I don't know why.  I'm a very busy man.  Because I guess I was the first guy in radio in this room, so maybe people look up to me because I might have a few more years' experience.  I don't even know why anymore. 
[00:08:00]  I think it's because you went to a radio college.  Yeah.  So you might understand some of the lingo.  They assume I don't, I guess.  I don't know.  I think maybe they're frightened.  I have no idea why.  I think it's easier.  I think you're more readily available.  When we first started here, actually when we first got hired, I was getting a lot of the phone calls.  I would look at my cell phone and go, oh, I know who that is.  Volume down on the ringer, back in my pocket.  And Anthony's not even lying.  He doesn't want to be bothered ever. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, never, ever.  Ever, ever.  You have ten messages.  Oh, okay.  Seven, seven, seven, delete, delete, delete.  So I had a really, really, really bad day yesterday.  And I don't want to bring the show down, but it's a personal thing that happened to my family three months ago, and it just kind of hit me yesterday.  So I really didn't want to be here at all, okay?  And someday on the show, I'll talk about details of what happened.  So I didn't want to be bothered yesterday. 
[00:09:00]  I didn't even want to do the show.  I was here.  I put a smile on my face, and I was ready to do the show.  And then we had another technical problem, and I said, you know what?  I really don't care.  I just don't care.  And I really want to just leave, you know?  Right.  So after the show, they called me from Washington, and they wanted to talk to you and I.  Washington.  Obviously about the bitching that's going on.  And I said, you know what?  I am unavailable today.  I will not be talking to you guys at all.  And then, well, you think Anthony will be available so we can talk to him for a while? 
[00:09:30]  Sure!  And I'm like, I don't know.  So I called you, and I pretty much begged you.  I'm like, Anthony, please, please take one for the team and just take this phone call and listen to all the stuff they have to say that I've heard at least ten times.  No problemo.  Yeah, so I, you know, stepped up, took the call.  Right.  I got, like, two pre-calls first.  I get the call from Straley saying that I'm going to be getting a call.  I love corporate.  I love corporate thinking. 
[00:10:00]  You need two calls just to tell you you'll be getting a call.  See, I don't understand it.  But we're trying, you know, all kidding aside, we're really trying to understand this place.  I mean, it's just an amazing thing, this satellite radio.  You know, it really is.  And where Anthony and I come from, it's just a whole different world.  And we've never been corporate.  We never will be corporate.  You know.  Right.  And we're trying to work together, and it's just tough. 
[00:10:30]  Well, that seems to be the root of the problem here.  I think a lot of management down in Washington assumes that we really understand this corporate mindset and how it works and how problems are supposed to be conveyed from the show to corporate in order to be solved.  And it's not just a matter of emailing someone or calling them.  There's this corporate protocol that everyone in the corporate world knows about.  But we're like trying to get us to adhere to it really quickly, though, is like trying to dress up a monkey and send him somewhere. 
[00:11:00]  He looks the part.  He's trying.  But, God damn it, he's still just a monkey.  Yeah, and that's how we are.  I don't want this to be perceived as trashing Washington again.  We just don't get it.  We just don't understand this whole system that has been put in place.  But we're working on finding the common ground.  Right.  You know, we have to understand how that corporate world works a little more in order to get things done and convey our issues and stuff to Washington. 
[00:11:30]  But, dude, those phone calls.  I know.  I told you.  They're tough, aren't they?  And then you've got to deal with what we said on the air because I hear in the background it's a conference call, so there's a couple of people in there.  And I hear, all right, Anthony, yeah, we're going to tee this one up for you.  Yeah, and then blue sky it.  And they act like it doesn't really bother them.  It doesn't bother them because they understand it's part of the show, but it so bothers them.  I know it does. 
[00:12:00]  It's so bothers them.  Look, I've got thick skin, and I can handle anything you throw at me, but others down here.  There's other people down here.  Those others are you.  Right.  You're talking for yourself.  I completely saw that.  I've been playing this game a long time.  I know it bothers you, okay?  Some people don't.  And then when I heard that.  No one has thick skin when it comes down to it.  A lot of people like to think they do, but no one does.  So then there's the head guy and more management, and I just lost my mind. 
[00:12:30]  I lost my mind at that point because then I just started unloading and kind of set the mood of the meeting.  And this is something.  I don't think you handle the meetings this way because when I heard that some people are upset with some of the things being said on the air,  I'm like, tell the motherfuckers that are upset they don't understand how a show like this operates.  And if their fucking feelings are hurt, they can go fuck themselves.  Just don't listen to the channel.  Tell them to shit in their hat.  And this is how I'm talking.  Shit in their hat.  Did you really say shit in the hat?  I think I did say shit in the hat. 
[00:13:00]  What the hell does that mean?  There's no coming back from that.  I had used the F words so much that I wanted to mix it up a little.  You wanted to spice it up with an S word?  Yeah, I wanted to spice it up a little bit.  So, you know, they were, I don't even understand what the meeting was really about.  It was kind of about how we handle the problems down here and how we should better handle them by involving the people in D.C. more.  Well, we just, you know what, we just need an office. 
[00:13:30]  And then occasionally you can hear the ching, ching, ching from my poker game I was playing during the phone call.  We just need an office.  Right.  Anthony and I don't want to stay around here after the show because we've been sitting in these seats that we're sitting in now for about five and a half hours straight by the time we get off the air.  And they need.  And there's people out there that work a lot harder and a lot longer days.  We understand that.  But to sit in the same seat and stare at each other for five and a half hours and then have nowhere else to go to unwind and maybe talk to our guys behind the scenes and take phone calls from corporate and just relax and see what needs to be done. 
[00:14:00]  There's nowhere to go.  Ben, our main producer, he was kicked out of a desk yesterday.  I know.  And there's so much work that has to be done.  He couldn't even do his work yesterday because the person's desk that he uses, they needed it.  So Ben's like, well, now what?  Do you know what?  So he had to go home early.  If we had an office, we could have actual conference calls from one area with all of us speaking with D.C., all of them at one time. 
[00:14:30]  Right now, right now, our conference calls amount to all of us being on our own cell phones in this building and trying to have a conference call.  It's like, hi, yeah, D.C.?  Yeah, well, if you would, and I, but the problem, I, because, yeah, yeah, you're breaking up a little bit.  Can I, and where's Opie?  I'm over here, Anthony. 
[00:15:00]  I'm skating in Central Park.  But I can hear you because it.  Hey, let me just get around these horse and carriages and these cabs and I'll be with you in a moment.  Those are our conference calls now.  I've taken so many conference calls on a cell phone as I'm going about 20 miles an hour in Central Park on my inlines.  I've never wished for dead battery more, too.  Like, I'm looking at my battery going, one bar left.  Come on.  Come on, you could croak on me.  Look, we love being at XM Satellite Radio.  If you need your ass kissed, we love being here. 
[00:15:30]  Apparently they do.  Anthony and I have talked about it behind the scenes.  We're having more fun with satellite radio than we've ever had, and we've been doing radio for 10 years now, okay?  We love being here.  But there's still things that just need to be worked out so we could do our jobs easier.  I said it yesterday, to do a talk show every day, a four-hour talk show.  And we're not playing many commercials, so technically it's like doing a five-hour talk show on commercial radio, if you follow me, okay?  Because on commercial radio, you're not stupid. 
[00:16:00]  You know how many commercials they play.  Guess what?  We're filling up all that commercial time as well, which is making it a little harder to come up with four to five hours of material every day.  And we depend on the phones tremendously.  If we're having a slow moment or a slow day, you know, we could count on our listeners because they're pretty trained at this point to help us out.  So when we don't have a phone system that works perfectly, that kind of takes us out of our game.  It makes it much harder to do our jobs.  Because that's why I said to Kevin yesterday, I go, Kevin, just fix my fucking phones.  Because I was in – I didn't want to talk to – I hung up on so many people yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  I just wanted to be left alone.  I understand.  And he was still trying to get me to meet.  I'm like, I'm not meeting today.  You could talk to Anthony.  Anthony will, you know, tell me what you guys talked about.  And that's that.  I'm not meeting.  There you go.  And I took a slight shot, and I hope he doesn't take it personally.  I can't believe we have to, like, kind of –  I know.  I know.  How people that have been in radio a long time.  That was the most surprising part.  I said, just fix my fucking phones.  And he goes, well, let's calm down here.  You know, technically the phones aren't broken. 
[00:17:00]  It's the phone screening software that's broken.  And I go, all right, Kevin, let me explain this to you.  The way I need to use the phones on a radio show is not working the way I need them to work.  So they are broken.  Right.  You know, I go, it was fun for the first two minutes to have the interns come running in with their little post-it saying,  hey, line two has this and line three has this.  And then it was fun to do the little AOL IM thing.  Yeah.  But that got old after two minutes, and then it was just a cluster F and really frustrating.  You know what the problem is?  See, the vice president in charge of phones down there would get upset that you're goofing on the phones, saying the phones are broken. 
[00:17:30]  And he goes back and says the phones aren't broken.  So the vice president in charge of phone software, it's actually his problem.  So he's got to go to the vice president in charge of computer monitors at XM.  Yeah.  Do you get where I'm going here?  There's so many people that you have to kind of go through that just saying the phones aren't broken.  Technically, the phones weren't broken. 
[00:18:00]  But as they apply to this show, the overall phones that we use in some way, shape, or form were broken.  And you know what?  You're going to have to get used to it.  We're going to keep complaining until we've got everything we need to make this show work.  Right.  I think the people in Washington, maybe they need to be up here on a regular basis and they'll see what we're up against.  You know, people that hate us, that don't want us using their desks.  And I understand that.  We come from different worlds.  You know, I'm not going to say we're better than anyone.  But, you know, they will. 
[00:18:30]  They don't like us.  They just don't like us.  And Ben needs to use a different desk every day.  Yeah.  You know, and then he gets kicked out of that desk.  We need our office done, simply.  That's pretty much it at this point.  I can understand when the phones go down.  And, you know, the studio is amazing.  And we're very happy with it now.  We worked out all the bugs in front of everybody.  That was, you know, the cause of a lot of the bitching because we decided to go on the air knowing that the equipment would have to be fine-tuned.  But we thought it would be kind of fun for us and the listeners to show you the growing pains of putting a new radio show together. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  But I don't think they really understand, unless they're here on a regular basis, what we're really up against to get this thing going every day.  Yeah.  It's that whole thing between the creative side of a show and management side, you know.  It's always butted heads.  But I think we need more of an understanding of each other and what we do.  What we do here, what they do there.  And, yeah, the people down there, it's a wonderful team. 
[00:19:30]  Everybody is working hard to make it work.  And there's a lack of communication coming from Washington because the latest problem was the office.  We finally brought that up after not saying anything.  And Keith, the cop, came in here on Monday, I think.  Yeah.  And, you know, he was here like three, three and a half weeks earlier.  And the first thing he said was, oh, my God, the office is exactly the same.  Now, if someone would have told me, well, they were having a little problem with the construction people or what have you or there was delays, then, you know, maybe we would understand. 
[00:20:00]  But all we saw in our stupid little pea brains is an office that's still not really being worked on.  Mm-hmm.  So we think, oh, we're not really a priority here.  That's what I think.  I start thinking, you know what, maybe we're just not a priority.  And did you get any calls or emails telling you here's the reason that the office isn't done?  None, none, none.  It's like if I got an email or a call saying, bear with us, you know, this is what happened.  We were doing, you know, we were making some good progress.  But construction has been, you know, halted because of. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  They would have been all right with it.  They're down there, and they're a little pissed off down in Washington that we aren't communicating with them.  We aren't sending them the emails or giving them the phone calls about what issues we have here.  But I'm not getting any, and nobody here has gotten a phone call or an email telling us why the office isn't done.  If there was a reason, an email that we got, that's fine.  Okay, here's the problem.  Right.  Enough bitching?  Well, it's not bitching.  It's just throwing it on the table. 
[00:21:00]  Actually, we're commenting on the bitching.  Right, Washington.  Why can't we be friends?  Why can't we be friends?  Our office isn't quite done yet.  Hey, that was good.  Will it be done next week?  I wouldn't bet on it.  Stink this early.  All right, enough of that.  But that's the latest on that.  And I couldn't be bothered yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  No.  You know, maybe some people should look at a calendar and figure it out.  It was a real rough day for me yesterday.  When you take the meetings, what are you doing?  What are you doing physically when you take the phone meetings?  Pacing.  Are you pacing?  I pace back and forth from one end of my apartment to the other end of my lonely apartment.  I am in front of the video games.  And they think we bitch on the air.  I am this close to telling them how I really feel on the phone. 
[00:22:00]  Because the frustration is unbelievable.  You've got to hold that in.  Yeah, Anthony and I are in a tough spot to begin with.  You know, we were at the top of our games when we got kicked off the airwaves for two years, four months, right?  Now we're rebuilding.  Now we're rebuilding.  And it's frustrating.  You know, we want to be back to where we were.  And we will be back to where we were.  You know?  Yeah.  But we need people around us to step it up.  Well, they want that, too.  Step it up in many ways that we've talked about on this show.  And we don't need to talk about it again today. 
[00:22:30]  Because, you know, I think everyone is getting bored with that crap.  I was playing poker online.  And then I switched.  I was playing EverQuest 2 for a while when I'm in that meeting.  They're hearing, like, you know, through the phone they hear...  I'm casting spells.  I'm running through the frozen tundras.  I'm killing things.  Yeah, if you guys only knew, man.  I mean, if you guys only knew the real difference between Anthony and I. 
[00:23:00]  I am so not corporate.  Well, I'm not corporate.  No, no.  You know, I have to deal with a lot of the BS behind the scenes.  You handle them a little more professionally, though, than I do.  I try.  And Anthony can't be bothered.  You know, all Anthony cares about, which is great, is just killing on the radio every day,  which is awesome.  You know, that's one of his jobs.  Killing on the radio and killing on my computer games.  Right.  That's what I do.  And I have to do the phone calls where I pace back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  You're in the same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing. 
[00:23:30]  You don't have to pick that phone up, either.  Just look at that number and go, up.  There you go.  Mute.  Put that on mute.  Not a bad idea.  Works.  All right.  What's up, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Jimmy!  Did you guys see the front page of the post today?  Got to applaud the New York Post.  Once again, a very tastefully done cover.  I remember years ago when Fred Astaire died, the headline was,  Astaire Way to Heaven.  Tacky.  Just a little tacky. 
[00:24:00]  But this one, really, what an unbiased paper the post is.  Just reporting the news.  They have Yasser Arafat, of course.  He died yesterday.  They have his widow on the cover.  Big, full, front page picture of her crying.  She's quite a hefty woman.  She's got her double chin, her no chin.  Look at that.  She's weeping.  Was she a beard?  There are rumors that he had AIDS.  I mean.  Oh, yeah.  Are we ever going to find that out? 
[00:24:30]  The cover says,  The Arafat Lady Sings.  Bravo, New York Post.  Rich widow's farewell to Yasser.  The Arafat Lady Sings.  And there she is, fat and weeping, on the cover of the post.  What did the cover of the post say when we were fired?  Did they have something witty to say?  I think it was Opie and Dopey.  Oh, the famous Opie and Dopey.  Opie and Dopey Fired.  Fired. 
[00:25:00]  So.  Well, they're all mourning in one place on the TV.  Oh, can we get the choppers there and just riddle them with lead?  They're all in one spot.  There's some town in Jersey.  What is it, Jimmy?  The town that's just full of these mutants?  I don't know which one you mean, but I don't know the name of it.  So I guess I don't know which one you mean.  I guess not.  I know what you mean, but I can't name it.  No low porches in that town for you to scurry under?  Oh, Monster Rain.  Oh, we got a new Monster Rain song. 
[00:25:30]  There's a whole Monster Rain-like battle going on.  It's a revolution, Opie.  I don't know if it's a revolution.  The latest one is average at best.  We'll get to that in a little while.  But they're all there in Jersey in this town that's just full of Muslims.  And they were talking about Yasser Arafat on the news.  They were interviewing these people.  Talking about him.  One guy said, he is our George Washington. 
[00:26:00]  What?  What?  He is like our father and our savior.  And all the businesses in that area have these pictures.  Did you know this place existed in Jersey?  Patterson?  Is it Patterson?  I think it's Patterson, yeah.  And they all just hang out there and hate America as they're making money in this country?  Is it the same area that had him jumping up and down and applauding and celebrating when the towers went down?  Opie, it's applausing. 
[00:26:30]  As Rich Voss would say.  Did I say applauding?  Yeah, that's totally correct.  Oh, okay.  You scared me.  It's a little joke.  You know what's great about having Rich Voss on the show?  I'm like an English freaking professor.  Oh, my God.  What a dolt.  What an ignoramus.  If you think I mess up the English language at times, oh, my God.  Worcester.  When I start feeling bad about myself, that's when you're going to have Rich Voss on the show. 
[00:27:00]  He saved the show yesterday.  He was hilarious.  Those kicks were hysterical that he was doing.  Those karate kicks.  They were hysterical.  Are they up on Foundry?  The video up on Foundry if I'm kicking?  Both Poe's and Voss' video up on Foundry.  Man, the video of Poe is getting thumbs up.  People are like, oh, my God.  Where the hell did XM Satellite Radio get this guy from?  He couldn't hit Hervé Villachez in the chest with those kicks.  Oh, Voss.  They were so little short legs. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  We're lucky we got Master Poe.  He was actually hired to work in Washington.  And you know the way things work?  They wound up just sending him here.  All right.  It's fantastic.  You know what I think?  I think Washington needs a little something from us today.  Okay.  What, like a little love?  I think we need to go around the room and give Washington a compliment.  A little love?  A little love.  What, one thing that we're very happy with?  Yeah, because they take things personally.  Even though there's a lot of things we've said, that was very nice.  So you want two buckets, one with nice things that we say about Washington? 
[00:28:00]  But that's human nature in general.  We've talked about this ourselves.  We could do a killer radio show, okay?  We know when we're having a great radio show, and we know when we stink.  We've been doing this a long time.  We understand the game.  We could have one of the best radio shows ever and get the email exploding.  Hundreds of email.  You guys are the greatest thing.  You guys are, you know, the best.  The cat's meow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some of them are like that, too.  You know, just complimenting on the show, and it's the best thing I've ever heard. 
[00:28:30]  No one does radio like you guys.  And then you get one ass that sends that negative email in.  You don't remember the hundreds of great ones from the fans.  You always, like, just focus on that.  Well, this is the old days, because I don't care anymore.  And then you get the one, you know, that says something, and that's the one you remember  as you're, you know, you're trying to go on with your day after the show.  No one ever writes to compliment.  Exactly.  And we have said a lot of great things about Washington.  I want to thank them, Anthony, for the state-of-the-art studio. 
[00:29:00]  Oh!  Is that what you're blessing them for?  Yeah, now that we understand how all the buttons work, and we've got the right microphone.  Is this like a prayer of thanks to Washington?  Yeah, I want to thank Washington.  Thank you, Washington.  I want to thank them for this fine, fine state-of-the-art studio.  Fine studio.  And your turn.  Hmm.  I want to thank them for not bothering me with those meetings.  No.  All right.  I would like to thank them. 
[00:29:30]  Let me look around.  Let me think.  No, I took care of the studio.  You got to do, you know, something else.  Oh, you get the studio?  That's where I went first.  I know.  That's the easy one.  Wow.  I want to thank them for the...  For hiring you?  No.  No?  That's their plus.  They should be thanking us.  Yeah, that's true, actually.  Yeah, I like that.  You know how much... 
[00:30:00]  You know how much promotion they're getting from signing us?  Right.  I like that we have management that call themselves things like ELO.  Isn't that great?  Don't you love that?  Eric Logan called himself ELO.  I kind of like it, though.  You like the ELO thing?  Yeah, he kind of leaves...  It is funny.  He leaves messages on my phone sometimes.  Hey, oh, it's ELO.  Oh, ELO.  I like it. 
[00:30:30]  It's kind of like we're, you know, buds.  Yeah.  We're buddies.  We're in this together.  Jim?  Yeah.  Say something nice about Washington.  I'm thinking.  I wanted to say studio, so this is going to be difficult.  Yeah, Opie ruined it for all of us.  Can't we just do one collective thank you for the studio?  No.  They worked really hard on the studio, and I want to acknowledge that.  How about thank you for the other little studio that you're building. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, master control behind the glass?  That's good.  That's good.  And also, thank you for building the little Frank's Place studio over there so he can have  his little area and be happy, and we can have our little area.  So thank you for resolving that conflict nicely.  Thank you.  Sorry that Frank's Place is the size of a closet.  Yeah, it really is awful.  But we had nothing to do with that.  Thank you for...  There ain't enough room in here to bang abroad standing up.  Wouldn't Frank just be aggravated at that little closet? 
[00:31:30]  I'd hate it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Thank you for building a security area.  It's not finished yet, but they're building a nice little security area so no one can walk  in and shoot your pals.  I know.  Thank you for doing that.  That's nice.  They're going to get past Master Poe.  I want to thank XM Satellite Radio for hiring Master Poe.  I want to thank Master Poe.  Shit.  I got that one, too.  Almost got it in before you did.  I could do with him, you know, not, you know, I don't like when he checks the bathroom before  we have to go in there, but in general, I like... 
[00:32:00]  He checks.  I want to thank...  I could be in there with a grenade.  I want to thank XM Satellite Radio for hiring Master Poe.  Anthony, you still haven't gotten one.  Can I thank him for something I haven't gotten yet?  No.  No.  I don't think that's fair.  Oh, yeah, you can.  How?  Because they were thinking about you.  I know what he's going to say.  The computer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get me one, a kick-ass gaming computer.  Anthony's going to get a...  Cleverly disguised as something I need for the show.  Anthony's going to get a state-of-the-art computer for his gaming, Alienware. 
[00:32:30]  I think you can only thank for things that you have.  Yeah, Anthony.  Can't thank for future wishes?  Can I pray to Washington for the computer?  No, you've got to thank them for something.  I've got to thank them.  Let me look.  I have nothing.  You could say something nice about the people down there.  Thank you for my trio that I get to check websites when I'm on the road.  No?  Oof.  Okay, let me think more.  You're not happy here, are you?  I am so happy, but I'm happy to be in this lovely studio that you thanked them for already. 
[00:33:00]  Damn it.  You really did take the good one.  Of course I did.  I'm not stupid.  One thing I'm not is stupid.  All right.  Well, why don't you just think about your thank you?  Think about that.  Why don't you thank Eric Logan for never saying ELO on your phone, ever?  Well, I can't because it happens.  This is ELO.  You might remember me from the 70s.  All right.  What do you want to do?  We could take a break or we could play a U2 song? 
[00:33:30]  No, we can't.  You don't want to hear U2?  I thought that was its name.  We're allowed to play them today.  We're allowed to play it.  Really?  We got the A-OK.  All right, here's the deal.  We could go to Washington and play a comedy bit, or we could play like a track from U2.  I say U2.  Wow.  And you don't even like U2.  Well, if that's to choose between one of the three rotating comedy bits.  No, don't.  We've gotten...  I'd like to...  There's a problem with that, too.  I guess other people are being blamed for that. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, right.  And they kind of work for us.  We have to have a meeting.  Is this...  Oh.  On whose responsibility that is.  All right, why don't we play a U2 song instead of taking a break?  George Washington is like Yasser Arafat.  Throw one in there, Ben.  Yasser doesn't chop down cherry trees.  He chops off heads.  He's not like George Washington.  He's a vulture and a savage.  That's why we'll never get along.  Because, you know, not to say that George...  I won't even say that George Washington was a greater leader, but they're so opposite on the spectrum that there's no way we're going to ever somehow come to an understanding. 
[00:34:30]  You're right, because somebody could compare him as being some rebel leader that was trying to oust people that were in there.  And, you know, there is...  You could draw a similarity between someone like that and George Washington.  But, yeah, Opie's just saying that the fact of the matter is, regardless of what each side believes, we hate each other, and the hatred isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 
[00:35:00]  It doesn't matter how many politicians you get in front of, shake the hands like they did in front of Bill Clinton that day, and, you know, get the peace prize.  Because there's just a deep hatred amongst these people, and that just doesn't seem to be going away.  Who are they getting...  Who's on deck?  Who's in the terrorist on deck circle for Yasser?  His name is Abbas.  Abbas.  It's a nice name.  Couldn't we have a Bill or a Bob or something?  They're all named Abbas.  Very appropriately, because that's what most of them get onto with bombs strapped to their belts. 
[00:35:30]  Rotten creeps.  All right, with that, we're going to play a U2 song.  When we come back, we're going to play the audio from the Channel 9 piece.  Channel 9 here in New York did a little piece on Opie and Anthony.  Not too much editing.  Yeah, we'll talk about it.  It's pretty funny.  On my side.  We talked for about 20 minutes, and they cut it down to a two-and-a-half-minute piece.  The teaser that they play during wrestling was a chop job.  We'll get into all of that after this U2 song, okay?  What song?  We're going to play Love and Peace or Else from How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. 
[00:36:00]  It's U2 on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back right after this song.  We'll be back right after this song. 
[00:36:30]  Lay down.  Lay down.  Lay it down 
[00:37:00]  Lay our sweet  Lovely  On the ground  Lay your love  On the track  We're gonna break  The monster's back  Lay down your treasure 
[00:37:30]  Lay it down now, brother  You don't have time  For a jealous lover  As you enter this life  I praise your heart  We'll wrink your face  And brand new hearts 
[00:38:00]  I don't know if I can take it  I'm not easy on my knees  Is my heart meant to break it?  A mess of brandies  Brandies, brandies, brandies  Love and peace  Love, love and peace 
[00:38:30]  Lay down  Lay down  Lay down your guns  All you daughters of Zion  All you Abraham's sons  I don't know if I can take it  I don't know if I can make it 
[00:39:00]  I'm not easy on my knees  Is my heart  I'll let you break it  Need some release  Around your knees  Color in peace  Like special medicine  By any of your loving days  Loving me  Loving me  Hope you still feel me  Hope you've been  Hope you feel me  Hope you feel me  Hope you've been  Been 
[00:39:30]  Hope you've been  Hope you've been  Loving me  If you were able  To your loved ones  I couldn't do  But I couldn't do  But I couldn't do  Hope you were able  I could cry  No  But I couldn't stop  Is still on  The sound is turned down  And the chips on the ground  Are about to dig in  I wonder where is the love  Where is the love  Love and peace 
[00:40:00]  Where is the love  Where is the love 
[00:40:30]  Where is the love  Brand new U2 love and peace or else  From How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb  On the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio  That's pretty cool, right?  I like how you gave your rock jock back sell there 
[00:41:00]  I don't have it in me to do that anymore  No?  No, I used to really be able to sell music  You really were like  It sounded like you were thrilled to be playing it  Oh, I was great at it  But now it's like, whatever  Hey, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts  I know  Hey, Leonard Skittered and Freebird  Are the home of rock and roll  102.3 WBAB  That was it  And it's two for Tuesday  So we're going to be playing Call Me the Breeze  Right after Freebird  You sounded thrilled 
[00:41:30]  I knew how to sell it, man  Oh, another block party weekend  What was a block party weekend?  It was three in a row, Anthony  Three in a row?  Isn't that a threefer?  That would be a triangle, I think  It's a triangle weekend  Yeah  Why  Why  Three songs make a block?  A block  A block  Of Led Zeppelin  On this block party weekend  On the Fox  Is that what block party weekend means?  That they're playing blocks of songs?  Yeah, three songs  Oh, I never even knew that 
[00:42:00]  Three songs makes up a block  Yeah  Not to be confused with the four-play weekend  Where the fourth track is always live  Oh, fuck  Wow  Or the five o'clock funnies  Awful  Or the five o'clock traffic jam  Where you jam three songs in a row  For all those commuters stuck in traffic  Or don't forget, get the lead out  That's right, get the lead out  We're going to be playing Led Zeppelin on your drive home  And I worked for a station  We were the first ones to do  Mandatory Metallica 
[00:42:30]  There you go  Mandatory Metallica  It's mandatory  It's mandatory  God, I hate radio people  Isn't it just awful?  They're just corn balls  Nothing new  It's the same old rehashed crap  They probably were good at one point  That was probably really cool  It was probably cutting edge  You know, there was a time  Radio was great  When I was working at WCMF in Rochester  It wasn't great back then  It was already starting to get corporate and stuff  But they had their 20th anniversary  And my job was to go through  All the old air checks  From all these old jobs 
[00:43:00]  As Spuds Buckley  Or was this as yourself?  No man, Spuds Buckley  Was when I was in Buffalo  This was Rochester  Sorry, I got that confused  What were you, Buds Spuckley?  I would love to get those tapes  Somehow  I'll have to make some calls  And try to find them  These air checks from these guys  I mean, all they used to do  Was get really, really stoned  And played whatever they wanted  That's what radio was all about  In the early days  FM was, yeah  You know, way before our time  And now it's to this point  How we started the show today 
[00:43:30]  How it's corporate  Yeah  And that's why, you know  Even we don't understand it, you know  So these guys would get really, really stoned  And look out the window  And talk about how the snow was falling  As they're playing music  Yeah  They didn't read liners  About, you know  Some stupid appearance  At some stupid mall  Or some stupid jewelry store  Where they like Clint Eastwood  And play Misty for me  Oh, well  Remember that?  He's like  Yeah, I gotta write some poetry  For my show tonight  That is the best movie ever  It's a movie about 
[00:44:00]  Clint Eastwood plays a DJ  And the studio is in some lighthouse  Somewhere, like by San Francisco  It was San Francisco  And he gets this woman  That keeps calling him up  Saying, play Misty for me  It's her favorite song  The song Misty  And she winds up being this stalker  And him  The best part of the movie  The story is  It doesn't matter at all  The best part is him  Describing what his show is  Yeah, I gotta write some poetry  Like he would just recite poetry  During his show  In between playing the song Misty 
[00:44:30]  That's what we need to do  But that was  Write some poetry, man  But that was what FM radio  Was all about  I mean  As the fog rolls in  I sit here  Gazing outside  Shut up  You know, you had to be a pothead  Or drop acid  Drug culture  I've heard from some of the old timers  That that was part of the  You know, the interviewing process  They want to know how many drugs you did  Wow  And if you were straight laced  Out  Back to AM radio  Broadcasting sports  Then these stupid suits got involved 
[00:45:00]  And really wrecked radio  And that's why satellite radio  Is going to continue to take off  It's a whole new approach that is happening  Genre  You know that time you're spending talking to the audience  That could be best spent having a sponsor talk to the audience  Because we can make money off of that time  Yeah  And then before you know it  18 minutes of commercials  Yeah, exactly  You know  But there you have it  But here is the revolution, Opie  The revolution is here  And I want to thank XM Satellite Radio  For having that 
[00:45:30]  For that freedom  That we have  To do a show  The way we want to do it  Is that my thank you?  Yes, it is  I'm thanking XM Satellite Radio  For giving our show  The freedom  To do the show  That we want to do  All right, good  I have a thank you for XM Satellite Radio  I want to thank you for making units  That a human being can carry  Without needing a hand truck  Unlike other shitty satellite companies  There you are  He's thanking the technical people 
[00:46:00]  The new air conditioner unit  Just put it  Hanging out your window  And play your favorite songs  It has a thousand tubes  And takes up an entire room  I was talking to our old pal  Sean Hannity last night online  He was asking how it was going  I said, it's going great  We're really happy  And we're able to speak our minds  And we know we're in the right place  And then he was asking me  So what do you think about Howard's move?  You know?  And I'm like  It's the stupidest move of his career 
[00:46:30]  And he doesn't even know that yet  Eventually he will  You know, because the little doggy company  Is so far behind  It's not even funny  You know, he's in for a rude awakening  He has no idea  I can't wait until he's one of the guys  At Sirius going  I haven't been paid in three months  I need my paycheck  He has no effing idea  That's the funny part about it  And he could have been with XM Satellite Radio  But he didn't want to be working at the same place  As you and I  I haven't gotten my $10 million check for this week  Right 
[00:47:00]  He has no clue  So I was giving Sean Hannity all the scoop  You know, because Howard's being all cocky  And wants Sean Hannity to debate Al Franken  Why?  And Sean Hannity stuck up for us  He's like, hey Howard, I'll do that  When you, you know, comment about all the things  Opie and Anthony are saying about you  Yeah  How you had that gag order put on them  And everywhere it's written about  Or talked about  It's, oh, the alleged gag order that was on  This  It happened  Howard Stern went to Mel Karmazin 
[00:47:30]  And told him  To tell our boss  To have us shut up about Howard  That's what happened  It wasn't our boss saying  Hey, hey  Why don't you shut up about Howard?  I like the guy  It was Howard running  Crying to Mel  The champion of free speech  The guy that's being censored  Crucified by the FCC  Gagged now by his own company  Because he can't talk about his move to Sirius 
[00:48:00]  That's the guy  That went to Mel Karmazin  Crying  Because we were talking about him  And talking about his children  And talking about his girlfriend  All the personal little items  That he made a career on  Over the years  Bashing people about  Talking about Mancow's dead father  Talking about Mark and Brian  Talking about Brother Weez and his children  All this stuff  Talking about that guy in Chicago  How his whole family should get AIDS and die 
[00:48:30]  All that stuff  John DiBella  John DiBella  All the personal jabs  That he took at these people  The second  The second  We turned it around on him  He ran crying to Mel Karmazin  And made us shut up  With the risk of being fired  And now all you hear about is how  Wah  I can't talk about Sirius  Because Viacom's put a gag order on me  How does it feel, fuckhead? 
[00:49:00]  How does it feel, huh?  Not too good  Apparently not too good  Because you're crying about it every two seconds  Wah  Wah, Robin  I can't talk about anything  Wah  Viacom's making me shut up  Where's my daddy Mel?  Why did daddy Mel leave Viacom?  Wah, Robin  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo  I'm crying  It sounds the same as hoo-hoo  Only with a boo in front  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo  My daddy doesn't love me anymore. 
[00:49:30]  Why?  My daddy doesn't love me anymore.  Allison.  Allison.  I can't talk about serious Allison.  How much is that check I got right for you?  Boo.  Same guy.  Same guy.  Same guy.  And we continued to talk about him.  So then they just started dumping out of our show.  And then it came time to renew our contracts with Infinity Broadcasting.  And we insisted if we were going to stay with the company that there was something but placed in our, I'm going to say placed, placed in our contract that stated that we could talk about anybody we wanted. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Now, we wouldn't put that in the contract in the first place if we didn't have this problem with him.  It wouldn't have been in the contract.  But we made them put it in the contract.  We were allowed to talk about anybody we damn well pleased.  It's in writing.  In writing.  In the contract.  And you know what happened?  The first time we brought that out.  Wah, Mel!  And, again, they made us shut up.  And we said, look, it's in the contract. 
[00:50:30]  And you know what we were told?  Who cares?  Tough shit.  You know something?  They said tough shit.  And not only did they say that, they go, okay, we won't fire you, but we're going to fire your boss, Ken Stevens, and we'll fire your program director, and we'll fire everyone that we hire after that if you do talk about it.  That's what happened.  Wah!  I'm being censored.  It's a conspiracy, a government conspiracy, Robin, against me.  You're the biggest, you're guilty of the same thing, jerk off. 
[00:51:00]  Have fun.  Good.  I hope they hold him to his deal and make him sit there miserable, not being able to talk.  Then you'll know a little bit about how it feels, you jackass.  Who, who, who, who, who, who, who.  Where's my, uh, serious, hello?  Who's the boss over there?  Um.  Hi.  Uh, Joe Clayton.  Now they're going to get rid of Joe Clayton.  That's very obvious.  I already know.  Um.  I don't know who the new guy's going to be.  Hi, Joe.  Yeah, it's, uh, Howard Stern. 
[00:51:30]  Look, um, I haven't been paid in, like, three months.  Yeah.  No, no, and I hear a lot of other people over here in Sirius haven't been paid in three months.  Where's the money going?  Poof.  I gotta write alimony checks for my pal, Allison.  Allison.  It's all about Allison.  I need to be paid, so when can I expect that check?  Poof.  Don't make me call Mel.  Cool.  There you have it.  Cool.  Oh, good.  Have fun. 
[00:52:00]  Have fun.  Whining and complaining about a gag order.  Yeah, him whining about a gag order.  It gets funnier every day with that asshole.  It's the same crap he pulled on us, and now it's happening to him, and now he doesn't like it.  Ooh.  Yeah.  What an ass.  And he's the guy.  He's the champion of free speech.  Making this show shut up because he was threatened by this program.  This was the show that he didn't want anyone to hear.  Simple as that.  The strategy for years and years.  Believe me, I listened to a lot of his show growing up in the 80s. 
[00:52:30]  Remember when it was funny and creative, and he was actually portraying himself as a regular kind of guy?  You'd listen, and it was entertaining.  You didn't imagine he was the type of scumbag that was running behind people's backs, running to bosses, crying.  And when he would rip apart a jock, you didn't realize back then that he was taking on the easy marks.  The people that didn't fight back.  That's easy.  And the strategy for these morons that sat there and took his crap for years and years because their boss told him, 
[00:53:00]  the best thing you could do is not address it at all.  Just sit there like DiBella and get pulverized.  But then the second a show like ours comes along and fights back and actually talks about him,  and it's funny, and it's entertaining to listen to, and it mocks him.  Even his listeners enjoyed it.  Right.  We had hardcore Stern fans emailing us going,  Hey, man, I listen to him every morning, have for many years, but, man, that was funny what you said about him today. 
[00:53:30]  Because it's true stuff.  Right.  You know, you grow up listening to the guy, you know what he's all about,  and it's easy to make fun of something you're very familiar with.  So that's what we did.  And it was off of his playbook.  He didn't know how to deal with it.  It wasn't a jock that would sit back and take his dick and sit there and not do anything.  So what did he do?  Got on the air and fought back?  Try to rip Opie and Anthony to pieces and send us down the river like Mark and Brian or DiBella? 
[00:54:00]  No.  Mel.  Wah.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  They're talking about me.  Make them stop.  Make them stop talking about me.  Yeah, we weren't in Mel Carmson's office January 2nd.  Couldn't tell you the year anymore.  Getting yelled and screamed at.  Yeah.  Yelled and screamed at.  And this was when we were pretty much number one in at least 12 to 15 cities.  Uh-huh.  Just getting trashed by the company because Howard couldn't take it.  Yep. 
[00:54:30]  Hey.  That's the thanks we got back then.  Uh-huh.  So, and now it's happening to you.  Have fun with it.  Yep.  Have fun.  Enjoy it.  I hope they hold you there.  Ooh, I just hope they hold you and make you shut up.  Make you shut up about it.  So you can't talk about what you want to talk about.  How about that?  It's a lot of fun, isn't it?  Jackass.  All right.  Hoo-hoo.  And I don't want to hear from anybody. 
[00:55:00]  Hey, dude, you listen.  You're a fan.  That's fine.  You know, that isn't even what we're getting at.  I could hate the guy personally.  Is his show popular?  Hell yeah.  You know, I remember listening and being very entertained by it many years ago.  I haven't listened in quite a while, so I don't know.  But people enjoy his show.  That's fine.  That isn't my point.  The point here is he's a phony hypocrite, and there's no one, no one that could call  up or write me that can argue that point, because we lived it. 
[00:55:30]  I've got to bring up one thing.  It might be a little uncomfortable, but he threatened to put your ex on his show.  Oh, please.  Thinking that was going to shut us up.  So we heard about that, and we went after him so freaking hard that he never mentioned  it again.  Nope.  And shut his face.  Yeah.  Absolutely shut his face.  Couldn't get that done.  Huh, Howie?  Yeah.  You knew you couldn't go down that road.  First of all, I talked about everything having to do with my divorce on the air.  I talked about it, even though I probably wasn't supposed to. 
[00:56:00]  There isn't any secrets.  No, I know there's not.  There really isn't.  It was everything that was there was spelled out.  When the Post and the Daily News talks about the threesome you had.  There you go.  It's pretty much...  It's pretty much out in the open.  Fair game.  The Post, oh, when they were sitting in the courtroom, and I'm looking from the witness  stand, and I'm seeing the Post guy write, and I'm just like, oh, I'd like to settle.  I'd like to settle, please.  I don't care if it's going to cost me more money.  I don't care what it costs, please.  That's the guy from the New York Post right there. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, please make the reporter put his pen down.  Sorted details.  But then Howard, yeah, threatens like, I'll get your ex-wife on the show.  Oh, really?  What do you think would be more entertaining, you talking about my divorce or me talking  about yours?  Huh?  Because, oh, what a treat that must have been to live with Howard Stern for Allison.  Whatever money she got, it probably wasn't enough.  Probably wasn't enough to live with that. 
[00:57:00]  Ugh.  What a guy.  And what a parent you must have made for those kids.  What a parent.  Love me, Daddy.  Remember Howard would say that?  Everyone, he would get on the air and start talking about jocks that are his clones, jocks  that would copy everything he does.  Yeah, right.  And say that what they were doing was asking Howie for love.  Them copying Howard is a cry of them going, love me, Daddy.  He'd sit there going, love me, Howard. 
[00:57:30]  Love me, Daddy.  Maybe you should have spent a little more time getting your kids to say that, huh?  Love me, Daddy.  Maybe then there wouldn't have been certain problems that we can't address for legal issues.  We could address them.  Yeah.  And we have.  You know something?  We vaguely went over some things, but apparently there were some problems at another station's  radio promotion.  Jingle ball. 
[00:58:00]  And all it showed me, all it showed me when I found out the details was there is a kid  that isn't getting enough attention.  And perhaps Daddy should have spent a little more time.  He's too busy walking to Vincentetti's with his hot new girlfriend.  Right.  Too busy, too busy ragging on other people about their parenting.  Too busy walking up Columbus Avenue with your tiny little rat dog, you faggot.  I've never seen a bigger faggot in my life, a six-foot-six guy walking a rat dog. 
[00:58:30]  That must be cute.  Who made you get that dog, you faggot?  You know it was his chink.  Howie.  It's cute.  Okay, sweetie.  Walking a blockbuster on Broadway with his little rat dog.  We're picking up Bridges of Madison County because Beth wants to watch it.  There you go.  Maybe you should have spent a little more time.  And he's still at it.  He has his message board.  He is so obsessed with you and I because he can't figure us out.  Yeah, he had his band from his board and he mentioned. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, we're not going on there, but our fans are.  Yeah.  And they get banned within seconds.  Yep.  He must have a guy.  That's all he does is look out for O&A mentions on his message board.  He can't even take that.  Can't even take that.  You know it kills him that he is the second guy to go to satellite radio.  And there's nothing he can do about it.  And there's nothing anyone can say that changes history.  He's the second big show that goes to satellite radio.  Did Jimmy go to the Brooklyn Diner for some food? 
[00:59:30]  Jimmy?  Oh, hey.  He's coming back in the studio.  Oh, that's right.  You haven't heard.  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  He's eating.  Enjoying my bagel?  Oh, here it is.  My club soda, banana, bagel, a little sausage.  Sausage.  Steve from Long Island, what's up?  Putting in a little sugar.  Hey, Steve.  Wine.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  Nothing.  I remember when that hook-nosed Jew tried to claim that he created Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  The greatest.  You know what?  Austin Hoffman?  You know, the greatest radio promotion ever is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, okay?  It is the greatest thing.  Ant and I figured a way to get people to put bumper stickers back on their cars.  Oh, I saw the first brand-new XM WOW sticker yesterday driving home.  First time I saw it on a vehicle.  It was on the back of a truck.  And above it was WOW O&A on XM in the dirt.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I showed him my tits when we drove by.  I'm still waiting for mine, guys. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, it happened.  It's like fishing.  You've got to put the bait out there, and then before you know it, you get that nipple.  I believe that Howard's insane, actually.  So the whole Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing that we've been doing for seven years, he claims that we ripped him off.  We ripped him off.  I told people years ago to tie a bandana around their antenna.  How long ago did cars even have antennas?  Wait.  I told people, and I called it aerial flashing or something.  The guy's insane. 
[01:01:00]  He is certifiably insane.  All right, well.  When I was working on the polio vaccine, this guy Jonas Salk, rip off a clone, comes up with this vaccine for polio.  But everyone knows Howard Stern invented the polio vaccine.  You know, I think at this point he just doesn't want to do a radio show.  I invented black people, Robin.  You were the first.  He spent the last two years railing on Bush because he had nothing else to do on his show. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  And now that that's over with and Bush got reelected, now he needs something else to waste time.  So now he's going to just, you know, whine and complain how he can't do anything on his show because he has a gag order.  Yeah.  So then that'll be the excuse for actually not doing a radio show.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we were on UPN 9.  It was all downhill after Billy West left.  And then once Jackie left, bye-bye.  I don't care.  You know, we're very honest on the show.  I will say one thing. 
[01:02:00]  Artie is awesome.  Hey, Artie's a pisser.  He's really funny.  But there's a chemistry thing that changed.  And the whole complexion of the show changed when Billy West left.  And that was because Howard was being a fucking scumbag to him.  Cough up some of that money, you cheap fuck.  Jesus Christ.  The guy was brilliant.  Brilliant.  And he had to go elsewhere to do cartoon voices to make a few bucks because you cheap bastard wouldn't open up your wallet. 
[01:02:30]  And the same thing with Jackie.  Billy doesn't even acknowledge him anymore.  No, Billy isn't even friends with the guy anymore.  And he was a huge part of that show back when it was really, really funny.  Back when it was at the height.  Back when he had that fan base that would do anything for him.  And then, you know, goodbye and again.  The Jackie thing.  The guy was there from the beginning.  From the NBC days.  Jesus Christ.  What does he want?  He wasn't asking for a gazillion dollars. 
[01:03:00]  Give him some money.  So we were on UPN 9 last night, huh?  Right.  I went to bed.  How did it look?  Awful.  It did?  Oh, dude.  First, they hacked up the teasers.  The little things they put on during the show before the news.  To say, coming up.  Shock jocks.  And they cut it up with me saying something that sounded like, I just want to go out and  molest a young child.  Really?  Pretty much.  You remember that episode of The Simpsons? 
[01:03:30]  Remember the episode of The Simpsons when they cut up Homer talking about the girl and  it was sexual assault or sexual, not abuse either, harassment.  Okay.  And they cut it up and the clock is behind Homer and it's shown all different times because  they cut it up.  That's what I felt like watching it.  It was just hacked up.  Well, I like having sex with young children.  It was like really bad.  Cut up.  Well, we got the teasers and then we got the piece.  The piece was what?  Like two minutes long?  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  We got great Michael Jackson audio, too, we're going to get to in a few minutes.  All right, here's the first teaser they did on UPN 9 News.  A woman who says an argument with her former boss got her punched in the face.  Also, the link between mobsters, gang members, and college students and what one little pill  has to do with it.  A violent crime is caught on camera.  A woman seen chased and abducted.  The mysterious crime coming up.  And then later, New York's most notorious shock jocks are back on the air. 
[01:04:30]  The hottest sexual subject would be underage sex.  We'll go behind the scenes with Kobe and Anthony coming up.  You can hear that isn't the way I said that.  Would be underage sex.  Underage sex.  Just makes it sound like we're spending our time talking about underage sex.  We're pedophiles.  We're doing a radio show.  Underage sex.  Like you could tell I said something after that.  Oh, man.  Well, what you said after that, we were commenting on the story about the lady that kind of seduced 
[01:05:00]  the eight-year-old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hottest stuff or the hottest sex?  But they don't put that in the piece.  It's underage sex.  It said you're all about underage sex.  How great is that?  Underage sex.  And what's scary is the news does this with everything.  Oh, they do.  They do.  They will piece things together to make it sound like that.  Did you hear that, Norton?  Oh, my God.  What?  You've got to hear the way they pieced together me saying underage sex after the hottest  sex.  Yeah, you can come back to the studio.  We're done with the Howard.  Yeah, we're done.  Relax.  I just went to get some skim milk, boys. 
[01:05:30]  Relax.  You got a bowl?  I sure do.  Good, Jimmy.  And I do respect you for not jumping on the pile.  I totally get it.  Yeah, you understand why I don't.  I totally get it.  You know?  That would be phony and fake.  You don't have a problem.  We have many problems.  All right.  Yeah, listen to the last part, the teaser.  New York's most outrageous shock jocks are back.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  What happened?  No, that's a different one.  What did that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  She didn't beat you up, did she?  No, it was really kind of a non-issue piece. 
[01:06:00]  But the way they pieced together one of my lines, a couple of my lines, they pieced it  together where I didn't say that, but it sounds really bad.  Here it is somewhere in here.  On the air.  The hottest sexual subject would be underage sex.  We'll go behind the scenes with Toby and Anthony coming up.  Underage sex.  You can tell it's something different.  It's from something different.  You guys don't have the original...  Of course not.  That would be smart.  Either one. 
[01:06:30]  I think it's funny.  I don't care.  That's ridiculous.  That's great.  And then here's underage sex.  Underage.  Here's the second teaser.  Still ahead on UPN 9 News.  Reebok wants to pump you up.  We'll show you the latest technology for sneakers next.  New York's most outrageous shock trucks are back with a new show.  I'm Pat Collins.  Coming up, we go behind the scenes with Opie and Anthony.  And then I'm watching it last night, and the shot from the corner that they did of the 
[01:07:00]  both of us talking on the air, that was cool.  That was your basic radio shot.  But then that shot where they set up the blinding white lights in front of us and put us against  the black background after the show, your close-up shot looked like you combed your hair  with an M80.  It was like...  You're like Einstein head.  And me, forget about it.  I look like I absolutely need 18 hours straight in a tanning booth. 
[01:07:30]  I'm like the white-like, pasty, pale, just awful.  Awful.  That's what happens.  I don't know why they use that light.  Remember the McEnroe show?  Yeah.  The lighting is so subdued and nice and natural.  Why can't they just use natural lighting when they do news things?  They pull out those spotlights, and it just hits you in the face, this white fluorescent. 
[01:08:00]  Well, it makes you squint, too.  Yeah.  It makes you close your eyes a little bit, and we're kind of tired to begin with.  It's just not...  Oh, it was awful.  It's just not a good look.  I guess we...  You know what?  I think we need a higher makeup and hairdresser.  You think so?  We need makeovers.  Yeah.  Get our makeup done every day.  An O&A makeover on UPN9 News.  Hey, guys, let's turn it into a queer eye.  That'd be a hoot.  Hey, queer eye.  We'll fight some faggots over to gussy us up and fix our houses. 
[01:08:30]  That's what you want is dirty, ass-fingering hands on your face.  Let's get a full-time makeup artist, Anthony.  Full-time makeup artist.  Yeah, we need that makeup and hair guy to follow us around for when we walk our little shitty dog.  Little rat dog.  We'll just make Steve C. do it.  Make Martini Steve do it.  All right.  Well, and now here's the piece.  Oh, okay.  We got the piece now.  With Pat Collins.  If you need to stop, let me know, okay?  Two other shock jocks are already on satellite radio. 
[01:09:00]  Opie and Anthony were yanked off the air a couple of years ago.  Oh, wait.  This goes from the Howard piece?  All right.  Let me listen to this.  See, Howard, who thinks he's the first to go to satellite radio.  Another lie that he likes to tell.  He tells a lot of them.  Well, this is not much of a shock, but Howard Stern wants out of his job.  Stern claims that his current bosses at Viacom are censoring him and they're threatening him.  The shock jock is set to launch a new show on Sirius Satellite Radio in 2006.  He says that he'd be willing to make the move from K-Rock sooner. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, wait.  Then he goes to this.  Two other shock jocks are already on satellite radio.  Opie and Anthony.  You hear that, Howard?  You hear that?  Already.  Oh, my God.  They were yanked off the air a couple of years ago, but Pat Collins tells us they are back and better than ever.  Two years ago, Opie and Anthony were fired by WNEWFM after a scandal that involved a couple allegedly having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[01:10:00]  The banished shock jocks are now back.  They will appear as part of the New York Comedy Festival Saturday night, and they are totally uncensored on their new satellite radio show.  The hottest sexual subject would be underage sex.  The hot topic here is...  What a bad, bad edit that is.  Isn't that great?  Holy shit.  I like her, but that's news.  You can't do that on the news.  Listen to that. 
[01:10:30]  Well, the reason...  Yeah.  Well, there was more to it.  Yeah.  Because she asked us that, and we said, well, the hottest...  Wow.  Because we were talking about the front page of the papers where it was that older lady with the eight-year-old boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They made it sound like that's what we want to do on satellite radio.  Right.  Talking about underage sex.  What else do they do over there at UPN 9?  Do they put together photos of Oswald holding rifles with incorrect shadowing?  Wow, is that bad.  Well, actually, Oswald was the lead singer, and then the other guy was playing... 
[01:11:00]  Playing the keyboard.  And the other guy...  I saw that picture.  And the other guy was playing the guitar.  That's what really was going on there.  It was a punk rock band.  No, it wasn't Opie.  You've got to see the photo.  That was great.  Yeah.  Opie, no, it wasn't.  No, I believe that photo.  Because, like, Oswald's bent over, and he's got the microphone in his hand.  You ever see that shot?  Screaming out some lead vocals.  That is really funny, that one.  Hatsy.  The hot topic here is the Connecticut receptionist who allegedly seduced her eight-year-old neighbor.  At least she acknowledged that was the story.  Wait, we might have to retract. 
[01:11:30]  No, because the way...  I don't know.  It just put that image right from the beginning.  No, but the way you said they edited you saying...  You didn't just...  Unless it's a glitch of the tape, which...  Censored on their new satellite radio.  The hottest sexual subject would be underage sex.  The hot topic here is the Connecticut receptionist who allegedly seduced her eight-year-old neighbor.  Well, she's obviously a kook.  I'm sure her husband's got to be proud.  Look at his friends at work. 
[01:12:00]  Even the Grevy's wife should hang out.  I don't know.  What did you do wrong?  I don't know.  How about you?  Anything goes...  Yeah, Jimmy made the clip.  I saw that last night.  The camera swings over to little Jimmy Norton in the clip.  Oh, I'd like to see a copy of that clip.  Of course.  Some fine work they did over there at UPN9?  Well, it's up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, good.  You could watch this for yourself.  I don't know what you do wrong.  I don't know what you do.  Yeah, sometimes I act it out on the radio.  You guys should see me.  Your arms are going.  You got to see it in the clip.  What did you do?  I don't know.  What did you do?  Oh, camera strike.  I want everyone to know it. 
[01:12:30]  You, you, you, and everybody.  Well, more importantly, they used that line in the teaser to make people think differently.  Right.  And all those people that didn't stay up to watch the rest of the story, they went to  work thinking that you and I are pedophiles and we enjoy talking about underage sex.  Underage sex.  Every morning.  Thing goes on XM Satellite Radio.  Digitally transmitted.  It operates beyond the reach of FCC sensors. 
[01:13:00]  We have said all seven dirty words that George Carlin made famous.  Can you read my lips?  Since that St. Patrick's sex in public scandal, the guys have done nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  Just check the days off like a prisoner does.  I would say we're outcasts.  Before they were booted from the airways, Opie and Anne.  You hear how tired we are after the show?  It's not bad that clip.  It's like, no, we did absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I got to go backwards a little bit. 
[01:13:30]  What, you going to go back to the McGreevy's wife part?  That is a, that might be the highlight.  No, you know what?  That is not the highlight of this piece.  Anthony gets the highlight of this piece.  It's coming up.  Before they were booted from the airways, Opie and Anthony were number one in afternoon drive time radio.  Well, we honestly thought we could almost get away with murder back then.  We were on the sidelines from when Howard retired.  They told us, you know, we were going to step into his position.  At the time, we were also in an environment in radio where the more controversial you are, 
[01:14:00]  the more trouble you got into, the better your career went.  Those days are gone, and Opie and Anthony admit they crossed the line two years ago.  I was born and raised a Catholic, and I knew it was morally wrong, you know.  It was never supposed to go down like that, so.  What a complete...  The guys have lost none of their bite.  Here they are commenting on some celebrities in the news.  Ashley Simpson.  Hot, but stupid.  Jessica and Nick. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, Jessica, of course.  Ooh, Nick.  Will they divorce?  Of course they will.  Oh, because Jessica's not giving Nick what he wants.  The Jay-Z R. Kelly do.  I think Jay-Z's making him look like a biatch.  And I think, you know, it's time to start waving the guns in the air like he just don't  Kaya.  Wow.  That's it.  In the air like he just don't Kaya.  That's right.  Oof. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  That's the highlight.  Yeah, that's it.  But Anthony comes back strong after that.  Really strong.  I love that one.  That's the highlight, but then he has the line of the whole piece coming up here.  Like they just don't Kaya.  I want to know why Claire Bertrand was in that interview.  You have Nick and Sorte with a Kaya.  Wave him in the air.  Air.  They let you drink right here in the air, Paul.  I think Jay-Z's making him look like a biatch. 
[01:15:30]  And I think, you know, it's time to start waving the guns in the air like he just don't  Kaya.  And what about Hillary Clinton's presidential chances?  If you get electoral votes for fat ankles, she's in.  Opie and Anthony take over the Hammerstein Ballroom Saturday night as part of the New  York Comedy Festival.  And they are on XM Radio 6 to 10 every weekday morning.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  I'm Pat Collins, UPN 9 News.  You know what?  She did a good piece.  She did a really good piece.  I like that they left that in, the Hillary thing.  Yeah.  It saved you. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  Why?  You didn't like to wave the guns in the air like they just don't Kaya?  We liked it, but we could have goofed on that for at least an hour.  But then you come back strong with the Hillary thing.  That was very funny to have somebody saying that on the news.  True.  You never see that.  All right.  I just don't like the way you make fun of Hillary's body and stuff.  It's not really appropriate.  No.  No.  It's not.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  We have lots to do today.  That was a good piece.  We got to talk about Trump's Kid, the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. 
[01:16:30]  Ooh.  Merry Christmas.  Private Ryan.  I mean, we could just yell and scream all day today because this is crap in the news today.  Private Ryan is being pulled from TV because people are scared to air it.  This, we definitely got to get into.  The high school jocks slapped with sex rap.  They're the real shock jocks, Opie.  That's right.  And then the, no, I'm not going for it today.  I was slowing out of it yesterday.  He's whispering at him.  And then we got the Michael Jackson audio. 
[01:17:00]  We could do that next.  We're out too.  And the GTA 3 lawsuit is really funny.  And then the story about persistent erections is very good, too.  We're going to do a lot of radio today.  And is Dice coming by or not?  What the fuck is wrong with Dice?  I don't know what's going on with Dice.  He was supposed to call you.  There's a whole soap opera going on with Dice.  A lot of people were counting on him on the show yesterday.  Days of our Dice.  But he wanted to talk to me personally before he came on the air, right?  He wanted to talk to Opie.  There was an issue that he wanted to discuss with Opie for us. 
[01:17:30]  What's the issue?  I don't know what the issue is.  They won't tell me.  I want to say boogaloo galoo, boogaloo galoo, and see if you say I'm over in now.  I don't know what the issue was.  I don't know either.  And then the last thing I heard.  And then it was a whole thing.  Dutch clutch.  Then it was a whole thing.  All day long.  Then Pete goes, could you call Dice?  Right.  So I leave a message for Dice.  He never calls back.  But then what happened?  The newest excuse is Dice is doing shows while he's here and he doesn't want to come in  because we're on the morning now.  It's too early for us.  No, it's too early.  No, that was the excuse I got.  That's not the Dice we know.  Something's going on. 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  Something's going on.  He was supposed to be on yesterday.  We can't get Dice or Louis Black on our show anymore.  And we're being pressured to get guests like who?  I don't know.  Nicole Kidman?  Nicole Kidman was the latest one I heard of.  That we should have Nicole Kidman on the show.  If we abducted her and duct taped her and threw her in the trunk, we couldn't get her on the show.  I guess this would be a good point of the show to ask Ben, who are we supposed to get on the show this week? 
[01:18:30]  Because there's always a list of people that we're supposed to get.  I think Gwyneth Paltrow is on that list, right?  Dude, Nicole Kidman, that's not a joke.  That was somebody that we should be pursuing.  I saw his list.  It's like the Blockbuster's new release section.  Right.  And it's never going to happen.  Oh, you got a list?  Oh, yeah.  All right, listen.  His email list is amazing.  Ben's trying to get guests.  He's not fucking around.  He's trying to get guests.  Yeah.  Instead of bitching, I'm going to just explain things to people, okay?  Now, there's bitching, then there's just reality. 
[01:19:00]  This is reality, okay?  Okay, here's the reality of the Opie and Anthony show as we look at it today, the 30th show into XM Soundlight Radio.  The end of the sixth week, if you must know, okay?  We don't have a huge audience right now, okay?  We are getting exposure, but until this show gets much bigger, and there's many, many, many more people listening, we don't have a shot at any of these people.  No.  That's the reality.  They don't go on shows to hang out and have fun, these people, the A-list guests. 
[01:19:30]  They go on the show that they know they're going to get the most exposure.  Right, they're plugging stuff.  And with XM Soundlight Radio still kind of hiding us, and I do believe that, and if you're going to take it the wrong way in Washington, I'm sorry.  Opie, they are going to take that the wrong way.  I know they are, but the fact is we're still kind of being hidden by the company.  We just are, all right?  You know, we got the Channel 9 piece here in New York.  We did it ourselves.  We're being hidden still.  For whatever reason, I don't know, all right? 
[01:20:00]  I don't even want to get into it, but we are.  But until more and more people know about the Opie and Anthony show, we don't have a shot at these people.  Here's the list of people we're supposed to get for the show?  Well, no, those are just people that, you know, that...  George Clooney.  Yeah, we know about George.  Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt.  Johnny Depp, whose people, they don't even know what XM Soundlight Radio is.  What was their official comment?  They...  You know, whatever.  Whatever.  It's basically whatever.  Hey, can we get Johnny Depp?  Whatever.  And I'll be honest.  Green Day?  I think we could get Green Day on the show, sure. 
[01:20:30]  Okay?  The Donnas, I think we could get them on.  All right?  Seinfeld?  Not a shot in hell.  Well, actually, no.  That's not as much as you think, because of Jimmy and there's a...  Seinfeld's not as crazy as you think.  Really?  Well, they do have the DVDs coming out, right?  For the first season of Seinfeld?  You've met Seinfeld, and you've talked to them.  Seinfeld's completely intimidating to me.  You think so?  Completely.  Because I don't know him.  I've met him twice.  I met him once at that restaurant we went to, and he's outside with somebody that he  was with, and we were with some agent or something. 
[01:21:00]  Some guy from CAA.  Another big...  Whatever.  I didn't even know him once.  Another meeting that went.  But I found myself more flabbergasted and starstruck than...  I watched the show 18 times a night that it's on, and it's just...  I was starstruck.  I couldn't even talk to him.  He's a very...  I don't know him well at all, and I've seen him 50 times at the Cellar, and I don't know  him that well, just high and by.  He's a very honest guy.  He doesn't come over and chat if he doesn't want to chat.  Right.  You gotta love that.  One guy was gonna take a picture with him outside, and he's like, yeah, all right. 
[01:21:30]  So the guy stands, and he puts his arm on Seinfeld, and Jerry goes...  That person was you.  It wasn't me.  I got one on the steps.  I was afraid of him.  There's very few celebrities.  I'll be like...  Yeah.  I was like, yeah, he's Colin's friend, and if he shoots me down, Colin will just shit  on me forever.  Yeah.  So this guy goes to put his arm on Seinfeld, and Seinfeld goes, look, we don't know each  other.  Do we have to touch each other?  That's awesome.  He really is an honest guy.  That's awesome.  No arm around him.  Oh, yeah, just don't touch me.  That's funny.  Yeah, Seinfeld would be one of those guests. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, man.  We would be intimidated by him.  I would be completely out of the mix, because I wouldn't know what to say to the guy.  There's not many guys we would be...  Remember that episode on Seinfeld when you lost your car at the parking lot?  I know.  That was awesome.  We would be Chris Farley.  I'd be a babbling idiot.  All right.  Who else is on this list?  Mark McGrath.  We have actual video of Mark McGrath taking a dump from our old TV show, that stupid  Real Rock TV in Boston. 
[01:22:30]  We filmed him in a hotel taking a crap, and now he's what, on E.T. or All Access?  Extra.  I think it's Extra, yeah.  Whatever.  He's got that video?  It's the same show.  Yeah.  Whatever.  That Hollywood show.  Bon Jovi, definitely a possibility.  Okay.  We talked to him at the...  The Video Music Awards.  We had a great conversation.  Aerosmith loves being on our show from time to time.  We could get the...  No, a lot of these...  We could get those guys.  That's just...  A lot of those are looking good.  I'm just...  That's just the rest for the week.  Oh, Branson?  You asked me to try and get Branson.  I know. 
[01:23:00]  I don't think we're going to get him, though.  Richard Branson?  Yeah.  That was his show.  I heard it was awful.  Brian killed in the ratings.  Brian Williams?  It looked good.  Brian Williams?  Yeah.  We got Brian Williams, actually.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty cool, actually.  When, Ben?  We'll see.  We'll see.  What are we going to say to Brian Williams?  We'll see what...  I'll talk to him.  I know a lot about Brian.  I've followed his career.  He's broke cause replacement.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Yeah, broke cause replacement.  But what are we going to say to Brian Williams?  How does it feel to be replacing a stroke victim?  Oof.  Maybe he's one of those news guys that has a sense of humor. 
[01:23:30]  That's one of the ones that I'm waiting to see when they figure out what show they're  coming on in for a cancellation.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  That would be one of...  I don't think they had any clue.  We'll see what happens.  And then Jackie the Joke Man, who's been calling me a lot.  Oof.  That could be fun.  That would be fun.  That would be really fun.  He could vent.  All right, so there you go.  Is there anything good in there?  Well, Jackie wants to...  He likes us.  Yeah, we've met a couple of times.  Jackie's a very cool guy.  He likes us and he wants to do something with the show, actually. 
[01:24:00]  But we just haven't figured it out.  We don't know if there's anything there.  Flying gag writer?  No.  Well, guys, I don't want to get fired.  What?  I don't want to get fired.  Oh, uh...  Um...  I don't know how to tell you this.  Uh...  But I was only...  Sit down, Mr. Cheswick!  I want to hear this...  I want to hear...  I want to hear this all morning.  Howard, here.  Look, I'm making you funny. 
[01:24:30]  Howard, another line.  Making you funny.  Let it be known.  If you think I stink, that's fine.  If you think Anthony stinks, that's fine.  We don't have writers to make us funny.  And it shows.  We're either funny or we eat it on a daily basis.  It's the Jimmy Seinfeld picture.  Oh, on the steps of the comedy cellar?  Yeah.  He's towering over you because he's on a step.  A higher step.  Above you.  In so many ways, symbolically. 
[01:25:00]  Yes, this really does speak volumes.  All right.  You're just sucking his hog and pop your head up for the shot?  Oh.  All right.  Here we go, guys.  Let's, uh...  Bob Kelly, by the way, has a great Seinfeld story.  Well...  Oh, yeah?  That's great.  But Bob Kelly's not here.  As I said it, I realized it was not only inappropriately timed,  but it was an uninteresting tidbit to throw in.  Bob was on the phone that we could go to him right there.  Hey, Bob, what's your Seinfeld story?  The only way that would be interesting is if Bob Kelly was dead  and now you have to tell the story for Bob Kelly. 
[01:25:30]  If Bob was here...  But now that Bob Kelly is sort of, uh, you know,  being a part of the show here and there,  now we need to hear the story from Bob Kelly.  As I said it, I realized I shouldn't have  because there was nothing to go to.  You both go, really?  And I would have to go, yup,  and then put more Raisin Bran on my fat face.  So ignore me.  All right, why don't we play another track from the U2 CD?  This is instead of taking a break, so...  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like we're just playing music, people.  It's instead of hearing something you've heard 80 times.  Uh, the CD drops, Anthony.  That's what they like to say these days. 
[01:26:00]  The CD drops November 23rd.  Drops.  They're going to be on SNL November 20th,  and they're going to do arena tours and whatever,  and possibly Fenway...  Why do you have to add,  and possibly they're going to play Fenway Park next summer?  Because it's a big deal.  The drunks up here love U2.  You know what?  Actually, they're talking about it,  and it's like a public safety concern  if they had U2 at Fenway Park  because U2 sells more tickets in Boston.  Oh, and a Red Sox game isn't?  No, but I mean...  How many people die at a U2 concert  compared to a Red Sox game? 
[01:26:30]  Might have to start shooting beanbags into people's eyes.  You've got to admit, though,  that would be pretty sick to see that.  All right, listen.  So, from how to dismantle an atomic bomb...  Anyone who's sold on it at Wansta?  What?  Then it's on Fenway Park.  No, it sucks.  You're delusional, Jim.  You have no idea.  I do know.  They're not selling more than 10,000 tickets for a show.  Shut up, Jim.  I know you're effing with us.  The highest grossing tour of the last year.  Will you stop being gullible?  It's not, though.  It's not.  He's inaccurate, actually.  Shut up.  Numerically inaccurate. 
[01:27:00]  I'm just telling you something.  You two could sell off Foxborough,  or whatever they call it now.  Gillette.  Gillette Stadium.  Of course, it's got to have a corporate name.  Hey, so, yeah, this is instead of playing, you know, the comedy breaks,  but I just know our trucker friends, they're going to Hank's place now.  They're going to one of the country stations for a few minutes.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  I can't imagine there's a guy driving a truck, let's say, in Missouri or Tennessee,  that is going to crank up a new track from the U2 album.  I just don't see it.  That's the problem with playing music, you know, on our show. 
[01:27:30]  We love to show our musical taste,  but I think it's kind of a buzzkill for people out there.  Could be.  That's what I'm thinking.  I think you're right.  You know?  So I guess to the truckers that are going to turn off the channel for,  it's only a four-minute song, right?  So come back.  Play Johnny Cash.  I can handle some Johnny Cash on this show.  No problem with that.  I'd love to hear that.  All right, so from How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,  it's U2.  Are we going to play City of Blinding Lights?  Yes.  All right, yeah, cool.  Let's check this out. 
[01:28:00]  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. 
[01:28:30]  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. 
[01:29:00]  The more you see, the less you know.  The less you find out as you go.  I knew much more then, than I do now  Me on heart, they glow eyes 
[01:29:30]  The city lit by fireflies  They're advertising in the skies  For people like us  And I miss you when you were around  I'm getting ready to leave the ground  Oh, you look so beautiful tonight 
[01:30:00]  In the city of blinded eyes  Don't look before you laugh 
[01:30:30]  Look ugly in a photograph  Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see  I've seen you walk on free  I've seen you in the clothes you make  You see the beauty inside of me  What happened to the beauty I have inside of me 
[01:31:00]  And I miss you when you're not around  I'm getting ready to leave the ground  Oh, you look so beautiful tonight  Oh, you look so beautiful tonight 
[01:31:30]  In the city of blinding lights  It's time  It's time  It's time 
[01:32:00]  It's time  It's time  It's time  Oh, I'm getting ready to leave the sea  We'll be right back. 
[01:32:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:33:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, Jesus.  City of Blinding Lights.  All you have to do is say it's a world exclusive, and it is.  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  It's a world exclusive.  We were the first ones to play the brand new U2 CD.  I think I heard it in Fallujah.  Oh, no, you didn't.  I'm sure everybody's playing U2 today, but no, that was the world exclusive. 
[01:34:00]  You're only going to hear it here.  Actually, you'll hear it here first.  You want some good XM cross-promotion?  Ethel is playing the tracks every hour today.  Nice.  I like that, Ethel.  Ethel's great.  What kind of music do they play on Ethel?  I never heard of it.  Ethel's like alternative rock.  Ethel's great.  Ethel's cool.  Squiz is cool.  Lucy's cool.  I like going to Little Ricky.  Little Ricky?  Come on.  Fred, Ethel, Lucy.  Huh?  No?  I think it's great.  Anything?  I'm tuning in to Mrs. Trumbull. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, my favorite is Mrs. Carmichael.  Mrs. Carmichael.  Well, Mrs. McGillicuddy.  Oh, did I mix up the names?  No, she was Mrs. Carmichael, too.  And our station is called the ONA Virus.  Yeah.  Oh, it says something different on the thing?  We don't pay attention to it.  No, we don't pay attention to that anymore.  It says something different what?  What's it say?  It says high voltage.  That's another thing we've been working on for a long time.  I don't know what's taking the company so long. 
[01:35:00]  It should be the virus or ONA Virus.  That's it.  It has to be Opie and Anthony.  The name recognition has to be in there.  High voltage means nothing.  No complaining.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Brian from Jersey.  A-list celebrities.  Perhaps someone should let DC know what happens when ONA books such film legends as Michael  Winslow to the program.  Do you remember that one?  We had Michael Winslow, who was the black guy who made the sound effects with his mouth 
[01:35:30]  on the Police Academy movies.  Yeah.  That was funny for two minutes.  I have never seen anyone flee a studio as quickly as he did.  He left with fear.  He left with sound effects.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He went...  He was sitting on the couch waiting to come on the show.  And I think we were doing Sex for Sam on one of those crazy things.  It was a Sex for Sam day. 
[01:36:00]  Was it?  And all of a sudden we're like, all right, well, why don't we take a break from the Sex  for Sam and talk to Michael Winslow?  Well, on the list was having sex in front of a celebrity.  All right.  Was worth 20 points or something.  It was a big point value.  So when he came in, they assumed he was a celebrity.  And the couple started having sex right in front of Michael Winslow.  We didn't know, but he had found religion or something.  I don't know.  And he was horrified.  He didn't even say goodbye.  He just ran.  A couple walked up to him. 
[01:36:30]  He's just sitting.  Now imagine you're sitting there waiting to be on a show that you have no idea what this  show is about.  You're sitting waiting.  We don't even know what this show is about.  Yeah.  And a couple comes running out of the studio.  The guy rips the girl's pants down and shoves it in her ass right in front of you.  What?  He got up and ran.  What a dumb...  That's a show you want to be on.  Right.  That's the show you want to be on.  But he fled.  He was petrified.  He made the sound effects. 
[01:37:00]  Same with Tony Danza.  Tony Danza?  Tony Danza was doing an interview upstairs with the AM station Wins and...  All new.  And our producer got him to come on the show and he opened the door and he was all happy  in being Tony Danza-like.  Guys, how you doing?  Hey!  And then he realized within seconds it was the wrong place to be.  And he just kind of...  Hey, I love the whole being Andy show.  Right.  Anthony.  Anthony and Tony.  Yeah, Tony.  Yeah.  Anthony.  And then, yeah, he just turned around and walked out on us.  Oh, yeah.  And then Anthony Michael Hall just didn't show up because he found out what we were about, 
[01:37:30]  I guess.  Well, it was right after the Sex for Sam.  Yeah, the day after Sex for Sam.  What a pussy.  Didn't want to come up here with us.  Yeah.  And then there's been many of them.  Mm-hmm.  We get the sons of famous people.  Tom Hanks' son is a huge fan of the show.  Oh, remember that?  He gets bootleg copies of our shows and our bits sent to him in California.  Yeah.  And I think he also hangs in Jersey a little bit from time to time.  So we had him on.  That was cool.  Not Tom Hanks.  Not Tom Hanks.  We spent the whole interview trying to find out about his father because that's the closest 
[01:38:00]  we'll get to Tom Hanks.  Huge mega star Tom Hanks.  And we're talking to his son.  Yeah.  Oh, you always get this.  There's kids.  Mm-hmm.  The kids.  It's not a bad idea.  We should start something where if you're a kid of a famous person, call our show.  Oh.  Oh.  We used to do the if you're a celebrity.  You know, we wanted to know who the biggest celebrity listening to the show was.  Yeah.  And we wound up getting, who did we get?  We got Buzz from Home Alone.  Yeah, we got Buzz.  We got a guy that played a dead body in one of those cop shows. 
[01:38:30]  And we got the guy that was Grimace in the commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that was about it.  And we got some white kid from the Cosby show.  Oh, yeah.  That's very bitter.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bitter.  He's bitter.  Well, a lot of people.  So we wound up getting that, but I don't know.  A lot of people in LA have the XM Satellite Radio in their Escalade, so maybe we'll get  some celebrities calling us.  In the Escalades, yeah.  All right.  So we got to move on.  The audio of the day is the Michael Jackson audio, Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  What a coup for Fox News and Geraldo.  This is what Geraldo's doing now.  Hawking for Michael Jackson.  Geraldo was hanging out in front of some Michael Jackson fans, doing a little piece on Michael  Jackson.  Outside MTV, was it?  Yeah.  And MJ called.  Because aren't they protesting the Eminem video?  Yeah, they're protesting the Eminem video.  Eminem's video on the whole Michael Jackson thing is hilarious.  This was five or six people hanging out, one of them dressed like Michael Jackson, dancing 
[01:39:30]  around.  All of them had signs supporting Michael Jackson and bashing Eminem.  Why weren't we down there?  I didn't know about it until...  We're trying to, you know...  I knew about it ex post facto.  Sex bagel?  You should have been down there.  We didn't know.  Well, I guess I didn't know.  Yeah, but you guys got to start knowing these things.  That is...  I mean, we needed to be down there with our audio.  Yes, we did.  We're trying to get the audio of New York City and sharing it with the rest of the country  here. 
[01:40:00]  That would have been a great place to be yesterday.  Fun stuff those people had to say.  Right, right.  I'm sure it was great.  So anyway, go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  And, yeah, they were covering that thing.  I guess Geraldo, for some reason, is supporting Michael Jackson in his fight against Eminem  in that video.  And Geraldo, it looked like he was trying to say, let's give him a fair shake and let him  go through the legal process and then make our decision, which is all well and fine, unless 
[01:40:30]  you're rich enough to buy these people so it never does go to trial.  The guy's a scumbag, a predator.  He's proved it.  You don't pay off the parents of these children that are sleeping with you if you're innocent.  It just doesn't happen.  And you can't say you're innocent until proven...  Are you hearing that, Bill O'Reilly?  Yeah.  Even though it's a different type of case?  And you can't, like Geraldo, say, hey, wait a minute, we're innocent until proven guilty  here in this country, so give him a fair shake. 
[01:41:00]  You can't say that either when you're paying so you don't have to go to trial and be innocent  or guilty.  You can't pull out the innocent until proven guilty thing when you're paying to get off  the hook, which is what he did.  Guilty.  Then you're guilty.  You paid and bought your freedom is what you bought.  So Geraldo's backing this guy.  Hey, Geraldo, how about putting your kids up at Neverland with Michael?  Would you let your kids share the same bed with Michael?  Well, I don't think so. 
[01:41:30]  Unless you want a quick couple of mil from the guy.  Apparently that's what he does.  Not a bad way to make money.  I've been trying to get my nephew over there for years.  I keep sending a picture to Neverland.  He's cute, isn't he?  I'm thinking if you're a father of five, sacrifice one of the kids.  We'll take one for the team.  The whole family makes out.  You can now go take that trip to Disney and make them forget.  Still got four other kids.  Little mouse ears on, tear rolling down his cheek.  He won't be mentally scarred.  A little bandage on his bottom. 
[01:42:00]  Can't go on any of the rides unless they're standing, of course.  Daddy, my bottom hurts.  Do you smell the new leather interior of the rolls?  Do you selfish?  Freaks out at that Michael Jackson Captain EO feature that they have to.  Maybe you should skip this ride, son.  You know there's sick Fs out there that definitely would weigh that option.  Oh, they would absolutely.  Especially if you have a lot of kids.  Only one has to suffer.  I think with counseling, I think he could get through this within five years.  Wouldn't he do that? 
[01:42:30]  We have a really nice house in a really nice white neighborhood.  We could do this.  All right, so we got the audio of Geraldo.  Yeah, Geraldo then got a call out of nowhere from Michael Jackson.  Out of nowhere, I'm sure it was all set up.  Listen to Geraldo kiss Michael Jackson's ass.  And the reason Michael Jackson is even calling Geraldo  has to do with the reason I think Geraldo's being nice to Michael.  That one hand wash is the other thing.  You want Michael Jackson to exclusively call you during all this crap.  So that's why Geraldo's kissing his ass. 
[01:43:00]  Geraldo's a phony.  Real journalist.  Yeah, real journalist.  All right.  And did he draw a map in the sand of where Michael Jackson put his dong in the little kid?  Here on the bed, if I may draw this map of Michael Jackson's bedroom.  Here's the penis and here's the discolored spot.  And here's the corner of the room the boy hid in and cowered and then drank special, what was it called?  Something juice.  Jesus juice.  Jesus juice.  Jesus juice, right.  It's just Pepsi or whatever with a little bit of wine in it. 
[01:43:30]  Wine.  Yeah, he juiced the kids up.  Get them a little loose.  You've got to like that, though, actually.  Geraldo's such a phony, too.  He's hanging out in New York City with A-list celebrities going to all the big functions when he's not hunting down Osama.  Yeah.  Jesus.  What happened?  Why is he in New York doing Michael Jackson stories?  Why isn't he in delusion?  He's taking a break from hunting down Osama.  Why isn't he back in Afghanistan?  Remember when Geraldo goes, if I see Osama, I'd have no problem putting a bullet in his head.  I'd have no problem.  And his journalism was always being called into question. 
[01:44:00]  And I remember one time, because he was wearing a gun, he would walk around Afghanistan wearing a gun, talking about, if I see Osama, he's a dead man.  Man.  Didn't he used to be great on 2020 years ago?  Remember years ago he was a real journalist?  Everyone, if you remember Geraldo, it was for the Willowbrook expose he did.  On Willowbrook, it was a mental institution where a bunch of retarded kids were being left in their own feces, having sex and jacking each other. 
[01:44:30]  It was a very hot story.  They're confused.  They don't know why their little part is standing up.  Their pigtailed pubic hair at age nine.  Overly developed dummies.  Jamie.  How much fun can you have with those huge tongues?  Let's go to Jamie in Missouri real fast.  Jamie?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  You guys suck.  You need to get off the air.  We suck.  Wow.  You give Howard Stern 45 minutes of free plug this morning? 
[01:45:00]  It wasn't 45 minutes.  Free plug?  I think it was kind of answering back to the crap we went through with him for three, four years, sir.  You guys do it just about every morning.  Howard Stern less.  Howard Stern less.  Jamie, every morning.  Jamie, Jamie, calm down.  We try to be honest on this show.  We don't spend every day on Howard.  You know that.  Let's relax.  And if you don't like the show, then don't listen to it.  We don't care.  Yeah, he likes the show.  I'm about ready to cancel the subscription. 
[01:45:30]  I've had you guys since the first day.  Oh, I'm scared.  Jamie, my cancel.  Jamie, can I ask you a question?  Can I ask you a question seriously, Jamie?  Sure.  What's a subscription?  I don't know what that means.  I'm going to cancel my prescription of this show.  I didn't say prescription.  I said subscription.  Subscription.  There you go.  Jamie, then cancel the show.  Why would you listen if you don't like it?  Yeah, just cancel.  I don't get it.  It's real easy.  It's one phone call.  Let's do it.  And I will add, Jamie is not canceling this subscription.  I know he's not.  You'll be listening every day, Jamie. 
[01:46:00]  Relax.  You'll keep listening.  Let's just calm down a little bit here, all right?  If you didn't like the show, you wouldn't call.  You wouldn't rag about it.  You just would have canceled.  It would be no fanfare at all.  People that call up and are so passionate about how much this show sucks,  people that are so passionate about it,  are the people that keep it longer than the fans do.  The people that just would cancel and say,  you know, show ain't for me.  Let me cancel it.  That's the people you've got to worry about that will cancel the show.  You aren't going anywhere, Jamie.  We get people that cancel every day. 
[01:46:30]  We get the numbers of the people that are going,  you know what, I'm just not into this type of radio.  But you love it because it angers you in some way, shape, or form, Jamie.  You have to admit, Jamie, you've had some good laughs listening to this program.  You guys need to learn from Bubble Love Sponge.  Ah, there it is.  I knew it.  Okay.  I knew it had to do with someone, but, oh, oh, oh, and he hung up.  Hung up.  I hope he hit a pole. 
[01:47:00]  I hope he hit a pole.  Look, I've never met Bubble Love Sponge.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  But I can tell you this much, his act, he's a hack.  You know what, Opie, wait a minute.  He's a complete hack, and he's, you know, he was popular in Florida,  and he's been trying to get on satellite radio.  If XM hires him, whatever, that's their prerogative.  But he's a hack, and, you know, no one is jumping to hire Bubble Love Sponge.  Opie, please.  He's been out of work a while, and no one really cares.  Opie.  What?  What happened? 
[01:47:30]  That was Bubba.  Was it really?  He's driving a truck now.  Leave him alone.  Why did he hang up after?  Because he got us.  No, because he knew how awful that sounded.  He heard the playback out of his own radio and was upset with him, with himself.  All right, let's get to it.  What a tool.  Who's got a Geraldo story?  Just a quick thing about Geraldo.  Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Bob Kelly.  Get him on the phone.  You used conditioner this morning.  No, he didn't.  Did you?  I used conditioner.  Your hair's a little tamer. 
[01:48:00]  No, he came in and turned off all the ceiling fans.  It's a little flatter today.  Unkempt.  Look how flat his hair is today.  Unkempt.  Did you sleep standing?  No, I almost, I almost, I was almost said, did you sleep standing on your head, and the  lack of humor in that statement became apparent before I said it, so I cut myself off.  Punched out.  That's a brilliant comic that you know it was going to suck.  Hey, did you sleep with a helmet on, did you?  All right, do you have a Geraldo story?  But then I still snuck it in and tried it anyway.  Under the guise, and you were making fun of it.  And it did what I thought it would do. 
[01:48:30]  Got nothing.  Just a funny tidbit about Geraldo and what an ass he is.  When he drives in from Jersey in his Bentley, instead of, if you have a Bentley, that's  a pretty expensive car, right?  I'll say it is.  Now, wouldn't you put it in a nice garage here in New York?  He has his press plates, and he parks it out in front of Fox, and it gets dinged up  every day like a jackass.  That's just a funny tidbit.  I thought that was funny.  Well, that's not a funny tidbit.  You know, Ben, I fell for you as soon as you said, I have a funny tidbit.  You never should say that ever in comedy. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, I got something really funny I want to tell you, Jimmy.  You never do that.  You should have said, I was going to say that, but I cut myself off from the story.  What I was going to say was, but I realized how unfunny it was.  If there was something interesting about Geraldo, then if it was funny, it's an extra bonus  for you.  You're right.  But as soon as you said funny tidbit, inside I just went, that could have been presented  as Geraldo trivia.  Geraldo trivia.  Right.  Or what an ass this guy is.  Look what he gets what he does.  Yeah.  Don't say it's a tidbit.  All right.  You want to hear something hysterical?  That never works. 
[01:49:30]  That sets you up.  This is when you can say, you want to hear something really funny, when you know that  at the end of the story, there's like a retard, and he's on an escalator licking something  off the floor, and his tongue gets caught when the escalator goes back under.  That's when you can say, I have a little funny tidbit I'd like to tell you.  Not as hilarious.  All right.  So all this car being dinged, though, is not bad, but...  He dinged my car.  So here's Geraldo.  Okay.  From yesterday?  I think so.  Last night, maybe.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller in his first line. 
[01:50:00]  What's a supplies?  I don't know.  He's taking speech lessons from Voss.  He's got a supplies.  Supplies.  A supplies caller.  Eating a sclone.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller in his first...  We're a supplies caller.  We have a supplies caller.  I'm Geraldo.  Geraldo Lovera.  He's going to have a supplies party. 
[01:50:30]  Supplies.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller in his first live...  You know, when you're pointed out and you can't get past that, you've just got to keep playing it over and over again.  It gets worse and worse.  It's my birthday.  Supplies!  Supplies!  He's got pens and notebooks.  Were you surprised when the military kicked your ass out of Iraq for being an idiot? 
[01:51:00]  Were you surprised when Al Capone's vault had nothing in it?  Now watch how much funnier it is when you hear it again.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller.  That's funny.  See, we could have just let that go, right?  Of course.  Most people would have said...  I think you said that word wrong, but...  Whenever you're doing a comedy bit, you have to say, what would Bubba do?  What would Bubba do? 
[01:51:30]  He might be a nice guy.  I don't know.  I'm not saying he's not.  Got to stock up on surprise before the hurricane.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller in his first live interview  on network television at least a year as far as I know.  I believe Michael Jackson is there.  Are you there, Michael?  How are you, Herago?  I'm good.  Hey, buddy.  Let me ask you, how do you feel, Michael? 
[01:52:00]  There's all the kids running away.  That's what it sounds like in his room at Neverland before they get the Jesus juice.  Just screaming in horror.  Doesn't that sound like kids just screaming?  That is really funny.  It sounds like horrified children.  And the only reason they were horrified, their moms were grabbing them by the hair and pulling  them away.  I think we may have on the telephone right now a supplies caller in his first live interview  on network television at least a year as far as I know. 
[01:52:30]  I believe Michael Jackson is there.  Are you there, Michael?  How are you, Herago?  How about it?  Hey, buddy, let me ask you, how do you feel, Michael, about the continuing support you've  gotten from your fans despite all you've gone through?  They're running away like the old Japanese movies when the monster comes.  All right, with their little arms going.  No!  And their mothers are pulling them back towards him.  Mommy needs a new dinette set!  I don't want to open my mouth. 
[01:53:00]  Mr. Selfish, I love that line of yours.  Don't want to open my mouth.  Mouth would have been the easy part for me!  Well, Herago, it's because of my fans that I'm calling you today.  I mean, I feel they're the best fans in the world, and I decided, rather than have anyone  else speak for me, that I would do it myself.  It is because of his fans that he's calling in, because if he didn't rape them, he wouldn't  have this problem going on. 
[01:53:30]  Stupid!  Allegedly.  Sounds like he's got a six-year-old boy on his face, doesn't it?  He's all nasal.  Muffled.  Hello.  And I want to thank my fans for their strong support over the years.  They could have been anywhere today, you know, and they chose to be in New York on Times Square.  And I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart.  They have written thousands and thousands of letters and have made hundreds of calls regarding  the Eminem video.  Thousands of letters.  H-E-L-P.  O-W-C-H-M-Y-A-S-S. 
[01:54:00]  Thousands of letters, all strung together in horrific words.  That's right.  Actually, millions of each letter is a dollar.  I wish I had it.  Oh, you rotten predator.  Come on.  You paid off people to stay out of prison.  And I love them so, so much.  In London, over 4,000 people showed up on my behalf.  And I want to thank Reverend Jesse Jackson, Reverend Al Sharpton, Minister Farrakhan, The 
[01:54:30]  Source, Steve Harvey.  Bob Johnson in BET.  Jesse Hughes in Radio 1.  He's black now, Michael.  Yeah.  Michael now has to latch on to black leadership and black intimidators also, like Farrakhan.  He's latching on to them because when all else fails and when push comes to shove, you've  got to play that race card.  You've got to play it.  When money isn't quite enough, you know, it worked the first time with Michael. 
[01:55:00]  He pulled out that wallet, paid off the parents.  They went away.  He was able to molest their kid without any problems.  And now money isn't quite enough.  So, reach into the bin for the race card.  Pull it out and get all these black people supporting you.  Get BET supporting you.  And, uh, and now any white person in his right mind would be insane to, uh, try to, uh, do  anything to him because you'd be called racist. 
[01:55:30]  Ugh.  Guy makes me sick.  He's shunned his blackness for his whole life.  He has shunned it.  He has mutilated his face so as not to appear as a black man.  And now he's, he's, now he's, uh, you know, Michael Farrakhan.  You know what makes me sick too?  It's the black community for, like, instead of just going, look, you're, you're, uh, allegedly  a child molester.  Yeah.  Stop.  Yeah, yeah, the white, uh, power structures after Michael. 
[01:56:00]  Idiots.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the, the people that fall into this are, uh, uh, looking for support because they  have support nowhere else.  And these militant black leaders like Farrakhan will support a black person regardless of  their crime, regardless of how guilty they are of it.  It's a victory.  Imagine if this was a white singer in charge with, uh, molesting black kids for all these  years.  Can you imagine how sexy that would be?  Those little smooth, you know, melanin filled legs. 
[01:56:30]  Goddamn.  Oh, I am horrified.  But now it's okay because you rang, uh, the inappropriate bell.  We'll always point out what is inappropriate on this show.  All right.  Let's continue.  Greg Hughes and Radio One.  Greg Hughes.  And all the many others who have supported me.  And, Horago, I want to also thank you for your friendship and everything, all the wonderful  things you've been doing.  Thank you so much.  I made my feelings clear about, um, the Eminem video. 
[01:57:00]  I think that it's demeaning and disrespectful, but I also want to make it clear that, um,  it's not just about Michael Jackson, but a pattern of disrespect that he has shown to  our community.  Our community.  What's your community, Michael?  What community is that?  The one where you're black and then have years of horrific surgery that turns you into a  white woman?  That surgery?  What does he mean?  The community that includes him and John Wayne Gacy and Jesse Temendiquis and, uh, R. Kelly 
[01:57:30]  and everybody else who has ever allegedly fingered somebody who's under the age of nine?  Yeah.  Dirtbag.  That community?  All of a sudden, he's embracing the community.  And all of a sudden, it's not just about Michael Jackson with, uh, the Eminem video.  It's about disrespecting his entire community.  They have turned the Eminem video into some type of, not making fun of Michael Jackson,  but it's some type of racist video now.  It's just funny.  It is just funny to watch. 
[01:58:00]  Eminem has a really good sense of humor.  His videos are really funny.  Or hate his music.  The guy has a great sense of humor.  They hate it that he's doing it better than anybody black right now.  Sorry.  He's the best one.  White people got to take Tiger Woods playing golf.  Deal with Eminem being number one at what he does.  Deal with it.  That's why the source doesn't like him.  That's why BET yanked a video.  It's sickening.  Right.  All right.  He has shown to our community.  He needs to stop it and he needs to stop it now.  He needs to stop it and he needs to stop it now. 
[01:58:30]  Michael, let me just say that I support you because I believe that you're getting a raw  deal.  Raw deal?  You know what a raw deal is?  The raw little behinds of his guests.  That's a raw deal.  A nine-year-old shouldn't need preparation, H.  Michael Jackson, I support you.  You got a raw deal.  He didn't get any deal, you dumb shit.  Geraldo.  If he would have went to trial, he would have gotten a deal, some type of deal. 
[01:59:00]  It's still being decided.  He bought his way out of the first trial, you dummy.  A raw deal.  A raw deal would have been he went to court, he was innocent, and he was found guilty.  That's a raw deal.  You know why Geraldo's saying this stuff?  He wants more phone calls.  More exclusive Michael Jackson phone calls.  And then, you know, the rest of the world is talking about Geraldo again.  A raw deal.  How is a raw deal?  Pulling money out of your pocket, paying off parents of a child that you allegedly molested.  How is that a raw deal, Geraldo? 
[01:59:30]  He got Johnny Cochran when he was in trouble, and he got Cochran, and a month later it all  went away.  Cochran is a smart guy.  Cochran knows how to do it, but God's getting back at him.  Put a big, bolder tumor in his head.  Cochran?  Cochran's got a brain tumor.  Does he really?  Yes, he does.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Yes, he does.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Deal.  Not just by Michael, by Eminem, but in a lot of other aspects of life that I don't need  to mention.  But let me go on the positive side for a minute.  What do you have coming up?  Anything that we can announce to these people?  Something?  Give them some optimism? 
[02:00:00]  This is my impression of Johnny Cochran in a few months.  You must have quit since my hat don't fit.  All right.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I didn't say that.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  Here they come.  Wow.  They're despicable.  They're always the worst.  That's horribly funny. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, that's...  Wow.  Yes, I'm always working on wonderful music, and I've been working on several albums right  now.  I've been working on music today.  Music as a young child.  I'm working on something as a speaker, Ardo.  I'm on a music.  I'm in the process of making plans to do some other wonderful things that I'll be announcing  to the fans very, very soon.  What?  And I look forward to that, Ardo, you know?  I'll give you a call, too, soon.  I bet you do.  I bet you do.  Okay, please do. 
[02:01:00]  But before I let you go, anything else you want to say?  I love my fans.  I love you, and thank you so much for being there on my behalf, and thank you, Ardo, again.  Thank you so, so much.  Ardo.  Okay, Michael.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Who does Ardo love his fans like that?  I'd give him a good rump ride.  I'd put my face in the pillow for Ardo.  Thank you, Ardo.  Ardo.  He said he's working on new music.  I think he's playing that little four-inch, no-hair-having pan flute. 
[02:01:30]  It's great.  It makes music.  It sounds like...  Wow.  I just blow into this end, and it screams and cries.  Hey, Old Dirty is stopping by today.  He's here?  He's here.  Oh, yeah.  He went through the security checks. 
[02:02:00]  Lorenzo.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  You want to play another track from the U2 CD?  This is in lieu of commercials.  No, I don't want to hear U2.  How about the truckers?  We got a thing.  How about Johnny Cash?  Yeah, how about we do this?  We'll do a twofer.  Which Johnny Cash songs you got?  No, we're going to start with...  Which one do you want to hear, Ben?  Miracle Drug or All Because of You?  I do Miracle Drug.  Yeah, Miracle Drug is a cool song.  Miracle Drug?  Well, we're kind of debuting the new CD.  It's kind of cool.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  It drops, Anthony, November 23rd, and we've been playing tracks all morning. 
[02:02:30]  We'll play Miracle Drug going into break.  This is the breaks we're doing today.  And then we'll follow it up with a Johnny Cash song for the truckers and for little Jimmy Norton.  How about...  All right.  What's a Johnny Cash song you want to play?  I'd like to hear Cats in the Cradle.  Cats in the Cradle?  Yeah, we got it.  All right, so we'll start with the brand new U2, Miracle Drug, and then we'll play some Johnny Cash, and then we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:03:00]  What's up?  Oh my God.  What is wrong with you guys over there?  What happened?  Asleep at the switch?  That was the only thing you had to do today was push that button.  That was the wrong Johnny Cash song, and that's the wrong band.  Fill into a burning ring of fire.  All right, how about this?  I got it.  The wrong thing was Highlight.  How about we do a Johnny Cash sandwich?  What is that?  We'll do Ring of Fire.  Yeah.  Then we'll do the new U2, Miracle Drug, and then we'll do another Johnny Cash song, Cats in the Cradle.  Oh, so sandwich the U2 song. 
[02:03:30]  We're going to sandwich the U2 song.  Not all in a row, though.  Yeah, why not?  We can do whatever the hell we want.  How long?  It's less than 10 minutes.  Jesus Christ.  How long is the Cats in the Cradle?  Well, Ring of Fire is a short song.  Ring of Fire is like 212.  Yeah.  And how long is Cats in the Cradle?  Eric?  Less than three minutes.  Comment?  Hold on.  Let's ask Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel.  Cats in the Cradle is 312.  312?  That's not long.  Ring of Fire is like two, two and a half.  How long is Miracle Drug?  It's just shy of four minutes. 
[02:04:00]  Well, that's a long break.  All right.  You know what?  Let's just go home, then.  All right.  Why don't we just play a twofer from Johnny Cash?  We're not sandwiching the U2.  We'll play another track from U2 later on in the show.  Oh!  Because I want to hear Ring of Fire now.  And I want to hear Cats in the Cradle.  So let's do that.  Looks like we have an issue.  Yes, we do.  What?  We have an issue.  No, we're both.  We're good.  You're listening to the Obi and Anthony show.  It's twofer Tuesday on this fine Friday.  Wow.  A couple from Johnny Cash.  I'm going to go see a movie.  You're going to hit the post?  No, I'm not hitting the fucking post. 
[02:04:30]  Come on.  Just play Ring of Fire so I can take a leak.  Jesus.  Love is a burning thing  And it makes a fiery ring  Bound by wild desire  I fell into a ring of fire 
[02:05:00]  I fell into a burning ring of fire  I went down, down, down  And the flames went higher  And it burns, burns, burns  The ring of fire  The ring of fire  I fell into a burning ring of fire 
[02:05:30]  I went down, down, down  And the flames went higher  And it burns, burns, burns  The ring of fire  The ring of fire  The taste of love is sweet 
[02:06:00]  When hearts like ours meet  I fell into a burning fire  I fell into a burning ring of fire  I fell into a burning ring of fire  Oh, but the fire went wild  I fell into a burning ring of fire  I went down, down, down  And the flames went higher 
[02:06:30]  And it burns, burns, burns, burns  The ring of fire  The ring of fire  I fell into a burning ring of fire  I went down, down, down  And the flames went higher  And it burns, burns, burns  The ring of fire  The ring of fire 
[02:07:00]  The ring of fire  He'll be an Anthony show  XM202  A child arrived just the other day  He came to the world  He came to the world in the usual way  But there were planes to catch  And bills to pay  He learned to walk while I was away 
[02:07:30]  And he was talking for I knew it  And as he grew  He'd say  I'm gonna be like you, Dad  You know I'm gonna be like you  And the cat's in the cradle  And the silver spoon  Little boy blue  And the man in the moon  When you're coming home, Dad  I don't know when  But we'll get together then  You know we'll have a good time then  My son turned ten just the other day  He said, thanks for the ball, Dad 
[02:08:00]  Come on, let's play  Can you teach me to throw?  I said, not today  I got a lot to do  He said, that's okay  And he walked away  But his smile never did  He said, I'm gonna be like him  Yeah, you know I'm gonna be like him  And the cat's in the cradle  And the silver spoon  Little boy blue  And the man in the moon  When you're coming home, Dad  I don't know when  But we'll get together then 
[02:08:30]  You know we'll have a good time then  He came from college just the other day  So much like a man  So much like a man  I just had to say  Son, I'm proud of you  Can you sit for a while?  He shook his head  And he said with a smile  What I'd really like, Dad  Is to borrow the car keys  See you later  Can I have them, please?  And the cat's in the cradle  And the silver spoon  Little boy blue 
[02:09:00]  And the man in the moon  When you're coming home, son  I don't know when  But we'll get together then  You know we'll have a good time then  Now I've retired  My son moved away  I called him up just the other day  I said, I'd like to see you  If you don't mind  He said I'd love to Dad 
[02:09:30]  If I could find the time  My new job's a hassle  And the kids got the flu  But it's nice talking to you, Dad  It's sure nice talking to you  As I hung up the phone  It occurred to me  He'd grown up just like me  My boy was just like me  And the cat's in the cradle  And the silver spoon  Little boy blue  And the man in the moon 
[02:10:00]  When you're coming home, son  I don't know when  The wheels get together then, Dad  You're gonna have a good time then  A couple from Johnny Cash  Need to play a longer song  I need a few more bites here  But  Cat's in the cradle  Of that luscious oatmeal?  No, it's granola today  Oh, granola  A little song about a father and a son  Great timing for the booth 
[02:10:30]  Thanks, guys  And also Ring of Fire  By Johnny Cash, Anthony  Yes  Old Dirty's outside the studio  One of our old friends  And one of our listeners  Quickly, Pat from Jersey  Yeah  Saying, Ring of Fire  Isn't that how the kids' asses feel  After Michael Jackson gets through with them  Very funny, Pat  Why is Jim taking a phone call  During the radio show?  It's a chick  Oh, because it's a girl  What happened?  Is it a chick? 
[02:11:00]  No, it's my friend Yoshi  Oh, Yoshi  The smut puddler  The smut puddler  The smut puddler  You ought to see him put down smut  And then put a coat over it  So a lady doesn't step in it  I can blame the granola on that one  I couldn't get the  Granola  So, Old Dirty's outside  Yeah, but wasn't he arrested for puddling drugs?  And he was talking to Master Paul 
[02:11:30]  Does Master Paul, what, taped off an area?  Well, Old Dirty's one of those guys  That's kind of on the watch list when he comes in  Yeah, he's a good friend of ours  But he's been known to steal  Yeah  What he does, whenever he walks into anywhere  He's instantly casing the joint  He looks around  Like, I'm sure he's looking at power tools and stuff  From construction  Going, yeah, I could sell that  Yeah  I hate that  But the funniest, though, was watching him on the security camera  Outside with Poe  And Poe's got him up against the wall 
[02:12:00]  And he's searching him and everything  And he has  Old Dirty has, you know, a two-foot area that he can only be in  And Poe is watching him  Yeah, he's restricting him to a two-foot area  They have it taped off like Les Nesman's office  There's little duct tape all around the floor  You know what?  Old Dirty and two fans are just kind of sitting and watching us through the window  And Poe is out there lecturing  Why don't we bring Master Poe in real fast?  We have a lot to get to  Then we might bring Old Dirty in for a little while  Then get him back outside the studio so we can get some radio done  And then we'll bring Old Dirty back in, all right?  Master Poe, what's the scene out there? 
[02:12:30]  You're the best, old round  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down  You're the best, old round  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down  My head is too big  Okay  I'm sorry, what is the scene?  You have two young men that came here from Brooklyn  They're diehard fans  They cannot wait to  Well, they couldn't wait to come in  So Ben was very nice  And he allowed them to come inside  What a guy  They look a little scary  No, they're scared  Oh, they are scared, okay 
[02:13:00]  You know, the young man in the middle  You fight him right in then  Which one do you like, Ope?  I like the kid without the hat  Well, the one that was without the hat  He went to a game with, I think, a Yankees hat it was  And he got into a fight  So that should be interesting  Is that why his head is misshaped?  Yeah  Does he still get residuals from the deliverance scene in the mountains?  Wow, that's it  You gotta see this mess  Damn, I was trying to  Very good, you got it  No, they're good kids  That's the one 
[02:13:30]  Why the towel around your neck?  Just in case I need it  Why are you looking at me like that?  I haven't done anything to you today  Why are you even asking him that?  Because you wouldn't ask that  Unless you thought it was a little odd and strange  Why are you calling Master Poe odd or strange?  I don't understand why he has to walk around with a towel around his head  You're working out constantly, right?  During the breaks and stuff?  Yeah  That's all he does  The video is up on opianthony.com  So if he works up a little sweat  He can dab it off a little bit  And what's the deal with Old Dirty today?  What's your opinion on him? 
[02:14:00]  I think that  First of all  He seems as though that he's sincere  He enjoys  He wanted to be here  He can't wait to come inside  But you know  He was a little rough around the edges  And I had to introduce myself  Alright  Get to Old Dirty in here real fast  Jim, just move over microphones  I want these two right next to each other  Old Dirty!  Yo, what up?  What up, kid?  Tony!  Antonio!  What's happening, bro? 
[02:14:30]  What's good, my nigga?  Hanging out  Come on, man, Master Paul  He's serious, dude  You gotta be careful with this kid  You can tell, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  He don't fuck around  He is the real deal  You know, Old Dirty lives on the street pretty much  Remember how much we used to have to  He's street-wise  We used to have to dump out of Old Dirty's conversations  Oh, yeah  Remember how many times  You would drop the F-bombs and stuff?  All the time  And they're like, oh, my bad  It's like, God, we're working under the FCC rules  Not anymore  No, it's funny, Old Dirty didn't like the fact that Poe's first name is Master 
[02:15:00]  No, you know, I call him Bastard, actually  You know, I told him, yo, my man, what's your name?  And he goes, I didn't hear him properly  I go, okay  So I said, Bastard, can I have a drink of water?  Oh, boy  And he got heated  But my bad, Master Paul  I didn't, you know, a little wax  A little waxy in the morning, you know what I mean?  He could have snapped your neck like a twig  And my man Lou Danger  He's got a good grip on him, too, son  Quite frankly, we're all scared of him  I don't trust motherfuckers that got towels on their necks 
[02:15:30]  Right, exactly  And he works  He works  He's part of the team, but we're scared of him  We don't know when he's going to snap on in at night  Yeah, he look like he come out  I don't trust motherfuckers with the cargo pants either, though  What?  He looks like us  Like he's ready to assault him  Like he's ready to fuck a nigga up  Yeah  Master Paul  Like, what, motherfucker, what?  Dude, don't shadow box in front of Master Paul  Are you insane?  I'm not trying to  Master Paul, did you see?  Look, he goes into his zone 
[02:16:00]  He saw you out of his peripheral vision  It looks like you're ready to attack  Dude, he's trying to calm down  This isn't  Serious?  This isn't fake crap  Will you relax?  This guy goes into his zone  Out of the peripheral  Now because you just did that  He's trying to calm down  Instead of snap your neck  And now he's going to have to go back into his cubicle  And do that whole calming down ritual that he does  Right?  You alright, Master Paul?  Yeah, I'm fine  I was just  I'm okay  I'm back  See, there was like a little thing there  Where you making the moves  All of a sudden he goes right into defensive mode  Dude, he's the real deal 
[02:16:30]  It's like a lion  You can't parade a zebra in front of a lion  And go  Hey, well, the lion's got to know  The zebra's just kidding  You know, it doesn't work  Like on the plains of the Serengeti, Anthony  That's exactly what I'm talking about  You know, this is  Yo, my bad, Master Paul  Oh, gave him a little bow  I like that  Respect  Yeah, because he's all done  The orientated  The pressure points and shit  Yeah  Yeah  He could take your arms out  Where you won't even  Your arms will be at your side  As he's pounding your head  That's it  He could take them out instantly  To where they're just useless pieces of meat 
[02:17:00]  Hanging from your side  So we're not going to have a problem with him  Right, Master Paul?  Well, no  When he first arrived  I asked him if he had any weapons  And he said  Well, no  But  And I said, no, no  I need to know if you have any weapons  What did he take off, Neil?  I need to know if you have any weapons  If you have a weapon  We have a problem  I'm asking you right now  Take your weapons  And place it on the table  Right  If you do that  Yo, I bust out my Glock  Yeah  And when I went to N.E.W.

[02:17:30]  Yeah, I know  We know  Trust me, we know  You had to defend yourself  Against the likes of Ken Stevens  Right  And his poncho  Well, I had asked him  If he had any weapons  And he said no  And I told him  I said, look  If I find a weapon on you  We have a problem  We're no longer friends  We're no longer compadres  We're no longer familia  There's been a  You know, he would have been  Trying to deceive you  And that's no way  To start a friendship  Exactly  Yeah  And once he enters 
[02:18:00]  Our threshold  He's mine  Everyone in here  He's mine  Owned by you  They are mine  You guys realize  This will be called  The Master Poe show  Eventually, right?  Oh yeah  He's going to just  Completely take off  I'm okay with that  How about you?

[02:18:30]  It's not about Geraldo, is it?  Everyone laugh  Oh no  No, my students  They know that I don't curse  Yeah  I don't  All right  And what happens is  One of my students  Called up another student of mine  And they said  Well, you know  How is Master Poe  Going to handle this?  Because Opie and Anthony  They curse all the time  Is he going to jump in the studio  And say shut up?  And he says  No, you can't do that  That would be a wrong thing to do  And I told him  I says  You know  Why should I do that?  I mean  These guys are  Fabulous at what they're doing  That's their act 
[02:19:00]  And they're not  You know  That's not who they are  Off the air  They're actually great people  Master Poe  If you got any  If you got like  Some mind skills  Oh God  I told you you'd laugh  He's laughing  Oh God  Yeah  Oh yeah  Everyone laughed  In front of Master Poe  Right?  Yo, dude

[02:20:00]  Fenced in area  Master Poe can  Show him out I guess  Yeah  No doubt  Thank you gentlemen  There he goes  Master Poe  There he goes  Escorting Lorenzo out  You know what  Master Poe  Master Poe  Would not leave the studio first  He did not want his back  Oh no, no, no  No, no, no, no  He makes sure everything is secure  The best was Old Dirty 
[02:20:30]  He started walking  In the wrong direction  He's like  No, no, no  Over here  Like he grabbed him  And what did Old Dirty do?  Not a  He just  Oh, oh, oh  Yeah, it's funny to see Old Dirty behave  It's hilarious  Oh my god  We all laughed, right?  That was funny  Dude  You give him the hoo-hoo-hoo laugh  No, we had a laugh  Crazy  When he says I have something funny to say  You make sure there's a laugh  At the end of that story  He could have told that stupid  Ben Geraldo story  I would have doubled over  What do you 
[02:21:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa  You mean he doesn't use a garage?  Come on  Ben tells a story  I want to throw that XM cup at his head  And I know I won't miss him  No matter what direction I fling it in  And people ding it all the time  Yeah  They ding his car  Shit, my fender  All right  A couple things, Anthony  Wow  TV stations canceling Ryan's  The Ryan telecast  I guess yesterday for Veterans Day 
[02:21:30]  Saving Private Ryan  What a great movie  Was on a lot of channels yesterday  But a bunch of channels around America  Got scared  And decided not to run the film  Yeah  Uncut  A lot of the ABC channels  More than 20 ABC affiliates  Around the country  Including two in Ohio  Have announced that they  Won't take part in the network's  Veterans Day airing of Saving Private Ryan  Saying the acclaimed film's  Violence and language  Could draw sanctions from the FCC  Now, I don't know who you blame here  Do you blame the TV stations  Or are they kind of making a statement with this? 
[02:22:00]  This is a good way to make a statement  It's like, look, here's a movie  Where you show it in its entirety  You don't edit out language out of this movie  It's a great movie  It really is  You don't like it?  I love  Jimmy doesn't like Saving Private Ryan  Not really  I loved  The war stuff was some of the best shot stuff  I've ever seen  I just didn't really care for the story about it  I didn't really love  Tom Hanks was good  I just didn't love the story  I didn't really love the movie  I thought it was great 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, it wasn't a big film  I really liked it  And it's kind of like  Especially  You want to show these movies in their entirety  You don't want to edit out language and stuff  It becomes silly when you see them say  Freaking or something ridiculous  Or they just cut the word out  And there's no reason  The movie can't be shown unedited  Who is it hurting?  It's not going to hurt anybody  But they're so scared now  Of the FCC  And the FCC's made such a to-do  About just hearing the F word on the air 
[02:23:00]  That they're afraid that they're going to get fined  They're going to get huge fines  Every time the word is used on the station  All the affiliates will get fined  Right  And it could add up to millions and millions of dollars  So what they're saying is  We're not going to play it  Because we're afraid the FCC is going to fine us  Is that a statement how ridiculous the FCC laws are?  Or are they genuinely afraid and don't want to make a stand?  Got to thank Janet Jackson, obviously  And this is  We brought this up  This is the real problem with the FCC 
[02:23:30]  This is also the Bono thing  Where Bono got up on the awards show  And dropped the F-bomb  One of these program directors  He says something very interesting  We regret that the FCC  Given its current timidity  And dealing in this area  Would not grant an advance waiver  Which would have allowed stations like ours  To run it without any question or any concern  Oh, so you could get a waiver?  Well  We should have gunned for one of those  Everyone knew  Well, the FCC knew  They're on top of this stuff  You think the Pope could get me a special dispensation 
[02:24:00]  So my girl could get an abortion?  But this is an interesting  This is an interesting point  If they're really doing their job  The FCC should have sent out a waiver  Because they knew a lot of stations  Were going to play this on Veterans Day  And said, look  We're not going to fine you  For playing the movie  How it was supposed to be watched  Right  Alright  But they don't do that  It's a whole gray area  So you're a program director  At one of these TV stations  You have to decide  Do we take the chance or not?  Sometimes you can say the F word on TV  Sometimes you can't  Right  But now it seems like never 
[02:24:30]  Like you can't ever  Even if it's used in an artistic manner  And I don't blame the TV stations  They're all saying in this little article  That they wanted to run the movie  But they're just too scared  They're just too scared  They're going to get a complaint  See what the FCC's done?  I don't even blame the FCC on this one  To be honest with you  The only time I think they should be able to air stuff like that  Like Scared Straight was a documentary  That I'm sure got away with  I mean that was amazing  But this is a film  I mean you know  You either just rent it  Not to knock veterans 
[02:25:00]  It's like if there was a documentary on the war  Or something like that  But to me Private Ryan doesn't merit it  I just don't think it does  You don't?  Nah man  First I like Platoon better  Or Apocalypse Now  Who doesn't want to see Walter Kurtz?  I would rather see that  But I mean  I don't know  I kind of  I can see the FCC  But this is where the FCC's fucking everything  You know  They just are  It's intimidation  They're intimidating  All these stations and owners  Out of putting on things that they think should be put on  And things people want to see 
[02:25:30]  And they say  No, no  We're just enforcing the rules  But no  They're intimidating people  They're using strong arm tactics  With these threats of huge fines  So now you get things like this  Where people go  Hey, we could do this  We might do it  It might have been good  But we don't know  So we're not going to play it at all  Now they're getting to the point  Where if they're not sure  They weren't sure  They weren't saying  If you play this movie  We're going to fine you  They didn't say that  They're not sure  So now instead of playing it 
[02:26:00]  And seeing what's going to happen  Now they just won't play it  Right  And that's the problem  And that's what's going on with radio as well  You know  A lot of these companies  They're not sure if their jocks  Could say this or that  Or talk about this subject matter  So we're going to tell our jocks  Just to shut the F up entirely  And documentaries  And now you get watered down programming  Is what you're getting  Well, I think documentaries are a bit different  And  I don't think they play them either though  Oh, they might not  You're right  But they might not  But I mean like  Scared Straight or something of that nature  Would get that  I guarantee if you're a program director 
[02:26:30]  At a lot of these TV stations  You're now looking at  Everything you have played in the past  And now you're just saying  You know what  We better not play that anymore  We better not play that anymore  We better edit that  We better  And that's where the problem is  But in this one  There's no  I'll play devil's advocate  There's no  Like you're saying about the FCC  And they're a very gray area  And they are arbitrary scumbags  But  With this one  Fuck  And the extreme violence  Is an arbitrary  It's almost like  It's not even a gray area  You know  That if they want to fine you for it  They can  So it's like  It's not even a gray area 
[02:27:00]  You know what I mean  If they edited some of the violence out  Then it becomes a gray area  But it's used  Edit some of the violence out  Did we not see somebody  Get shot in the face  On the news the other day  I completely agree  I completely  I'm sick and tired  Of the carte blanche  The news has  I completely agree  And I'll use the term loosely  I mean the word fuck  In Private Ryan  Is used artistically  Anywhere it is  And correctly  It is when Carlin says it  Or Pryor says it too  Right  And I think that should be on TV as well  Well I'm just  I think you should be able to watch  In the year 2004 
[02:27:30]  Richard Pryor uncensored on TV  George Carlin uncensored on TV  Comedy Central would even show Pryor uncensored  We're insane as a society  I know  Start saying fuck on regular TV  Within a year  No one will care anymore  You're right  Can I quote a brilliant man  Rich Voss  They're just words  They're just words  Only he's talking about  Regular words that people use  On a daily basis  That he can't say  Colin pointed out  A great point on Voss  By the way  If I could just digress  To Voss for one second 
[02:28:00]  When Voss  After 9-11  When Voss called in  He called in  Because he said  After the attacks  And he said  My daughters asked me  What  When it was happened  That I had to explain to her  That honey  There are just people  That don't like us  And Colin always quotes Voss  As just to what an idiot he is  For saying that  And then I realized  That Voss said that  Because that's just  The answer he knew  People don't like us  People are going to hate us  He doesn't know why  No concept of the Middle East  Alright  Let's  He's talking on a personal level 
[02:28:30]  He thinks the Middle East  Is somewhere in the 60s  On 2nd Avenue  Wow  That was almost really awful  That was mediocre at best  People hate us  And by us  I just mean the Vosses  Laurie in Wisconsin  What's up Laurie  Well I think you guys  Are missing  The big point on this  The stations actually  Gave the FCC  A copy of  Saving Private Ryan  And asked them  To tell them 
[02:29:00]  Where it would violate  FCC rules  Because they aren't  Totally clear  On the new rules  Yeah  I mean this was done  In a scroll  Before they went  To other programming  I actually saw it  And it said  You know  Contact your congressman  And all that  And the point is  The FCC wouldn't  Give them an answer  That's the problem  They want to keep it  All mysterious  If they give them  An answer  Then that's set in law  That is the problem  With the FCC  It's so out of touch  And outdated  But it's worse than that 
[02:29:30]  I mean we've been  As broadcasters  We've been begging  For years  You know  Tell us what we can  And can't do  They don't want to  Make a precedent  You know that  With the sex for Sam  Thing that we  Always have to go  Back to unfortunately  But it was a huge  Case as far as  The FCC is concerned  We got fined  $357,000  Because of the word  Balloon Knot  A word my brother  Came up with  For the ass  For the a-hole  Well here's the problem  You need to see  The reaction  From the public 
[02:30:00]  Like with the  Janet Jackson thing  If there wouldn't  Have been such  A great outcry  I guarantee you  There wouldn't  Have been the  Big fine  There wasn't  A great outcry  For that though  There really wasn't  The outcry  Came after  The press  And everyone else  Jumped on that thing  And showed it  8,000 times  And a few small  Groups of people  That have power  These religious groups  Jumped up  And complained about it  The majority  Of this country  Didn't care about  Janet Jackson's tit  I agree with you 
[02:30:30]  But that's what  The FCC is doing  It's all political  They  Stations  Asked for them  To say  Where will we  Violate your  Regulations  The FCC  Refused  To give them  An answer  And I guarantee  You it's because  They want to see  Which way the wind  Is going to blow  Once it's all  Said and done  And then give them  A fine  If everyone's up  In arms about  Swear words  They refuse to tell  Them  They refuse to tell  Them  And so then  The stations  They're a little  Scared  So they don't run it  And that's where  We're losing this 
[02:31:00]  Battle  Yeah  With free speech  And you know  Censorship and all that  It's the fear  That you're putting  That the FCC  Is putting in everybody  It's not their  Actual laws  It's not their  Actual fines  It's this  This cloud of fear  That they're putting  On all the broadcasters  Where they just say  You know something  Too risky  Screw it  And when you have  That mindset  What do you get  As far as  Entertainment goes  Mush  You get nothing  Watered down crap  Well they did say  I know somebody  Who you guys know  Who was on a panel  Recently with a member 
[02:31:30]  Of the FCC  For some radio convention  And he asked him  And about you know  What the FCC  Has been doing  And you know  Cracking down  On this and that  And the guy said  Look you have to  Understand that  These religious groups  Are really organized  So when one thing  Happens  They send out  A mass email  They send out  Emails to congressmen  Everybody gets  They're very organized  He goes  And the congressmen  Come to us  And go  What are you doing  About it  So we have to do  Something  So the FCC  Ignore them  Because it's a  Small group of idiots  Well I'm just saying  In the FCC's position 
[02:32:00]  The congressmen  Are coming after them  Going you gotta do that  But for them  It's a lot of voters  Alright that's fine  But then the average  Joe has to start  Exactly  You know  Getting their groups  I know  They never will  They never will  But you walk around  Any city  You know  People don't care  As much as  The media makes it  Think  They don't care  The average Joe  Needs letterhead  And get their groups  Together  Like hey  They gotta wake the F up  And say no  You know what  We do like listening  To Opie and Anthony  On commercial radio  We do like listening  To them on satellite radio  What have you 
[02:32:30]  You know what I mean  We wanna see movies  On TV  That have the  You know  Realistic language  And depict realistic  Situations  Not the drivel  Mush that they put  That they put on TV  Now  There's a huge  Huge group of people  That love this type  Of entertainment  And until they become  Organized  There's a bunch  Of buzz kills  Out there  That wreck it  For everybody  They work for a living  They enjoy driving in  Listening to the show  Going home  Watching TV  But it's not like  If it gets taken away  By some small group  Of idiots  That they're gonna 
[02:33:00]  Turn around  And start writing letters  It doesn't happen  You go  Oh shit  That sucks  Now they're off the air  And you go about  Your business  Cause you got a life  To lead  These other people  Looking for something  They're looking  For a life to lead  So they pick up  These causes  They take this religion  In till it takes  Over their lives  And they start  Thinking that they  Know what's best  For everyone else  In the country  And we're left  With mush  We're left with  Granola and oatmeal  In the morning  Oh god  Jelly's a good show 
[02:33:30]  I heard though  I've never seen it  But I heard that  It's really funny  You know something  You can't even fake that  You can't even fake it to me  I love how you even try  You put it on the face  But your mouth gives it away  Cause it's trying to go  Ugh  At what you're saying  Don't even Joey  You're right  Joey's  Joey's a good  What did I just say  Joey's a good  I have a head show  Excuse me 
[02:34:00]  I'm gonna cough  Alright listen  There's another story too  We might as well hit on  Another video  Yo let's hit that  Another video game complaint  Grove Street  Grove Street  Yo CJ  You get CJ in the game  Get a girlfriend yet  It's hysterical  It messes everything up right  No no  He's gotta bring her flowers  We're talking about GTA San Andreas  Then he's gotta take her out on dates  But after a while  They start really hooking up  And every time she gets into the car  Instead of wanting to go to dinner 
[02:34:30]  She goes CJ  Let's go on a drive by  And then if CJ bumps into her  She goes  Oh my nails  Watch my nails  And then she says  She goes  I had three kids  But I gave them away  It's classic stuff man  I love that game  Three kids  But I gave away  And then  Oh they're really starting to get intimate now  Yeah  So every so often  She goes  I hope I don't get pregnant  You know 
[02:35:00]  Classic  We'll get to that later  There's a 59 year old lady  God there's too much to go to  Let's do this real fast  This is a quickie  You know how we were talking about  The 57 year old lady  For three days  Three days  She's on the cover  Of all the papers  They're talking about her  Being the oldest woman  In America  That's having  Twins  And she's on all broad  So we talked about it a little  But three days  Three days  On the front page  Front page of the New York papers  Huge stories  On all the New York newscasts 
[02:35:30]  I guess they were saying  That she's the oldest lady  To have twins  That's what it was  The oldest  Or right up there  Alright  57  I want to talk to my  Black brothers and sisters today  I am so with you  This is  This is such a racist country  I agree  On page four  Of the New York papers today  Page four  Page four  Now the lady we just talked about  Front page news  Lead story on all the newscasts  Okay  Four days  Or three days in a row  Three days in a row  Well the news 
[02:36:00]  They found  You're laughing already  Right  The news found  Someone that's older  Stop  Found someone that's older  She's 59  With twins on the way  59  St. James  Well this should be  A huge story  Front page coverage  Right up until she gives birth  Because she's older  Now she's the oldest  Now she's the older  Than the lady that was  On the front page  All week  Right  But the problem is  She's black  Anthony  Oh no 
[02:36:30]  So instead of being  On the front page  Of all the newspapers  She's on page four  And quickly going to page 80  A strip story too  Not even the whole page  There is a reason  That they didn't put her  On the front page  Hold on  Oh yeah  Let's get our  Inappropriate bells  In front of us  There's nothing bad  But they didn't put her  Because she's 59  With twins  Because she's already  In a story about being  The oldest woman  In third grade  Oh my god  And why 
[02:37:00]  Third grade  And why do you think  She's still in third grade  Jimmy  Because she's from Georgia  Let's go in  Yeah sure  Wow  Let's go inside the joke  Why do you think  Because she's a Georgian  Yeah okay  Alita St. James  You're just a spring chicken  It says  A 59 year old  Great grandmother  In rural Georgia  Would it say  She's just a Popeyes  What  Georgia says  She's expecting twins  And that would make her 
[02:37:30]  One of the oldest Americans  Ever to give birth  Mary Frances Harris  Has a good two years  On St. James  Who bore twins  In New York on Tuesday  Three days shy  Of her 57th birthday  So this lady  Is now the oldest  That's going to give birth  To twins  And where's the big  Front page  Three day in a row story  Well she's only on page  Four of the daily news  And she's not even  In the other papers  No the post  Wouldn't have her in  But unlike St. James  Who is a first time mom  And conceived through  In vitro fertilization  Harris of Sylvester Georgia 
[02:38:00]  Says she got pregnant  The old fashioned way  I earned it  I earned the mother fucker  I'm pregnant  I did it for the benefits  Why  Why don't I get no front page  I got pregnant the old fashioned way  For money  Wow  That really is racist  I do  Why isn't she getting the coverage  Cause  Oh my god  She already has five kids 
[02:38:30]  I'm reading  You know  Maybe we should read this  Before the show  Five seven  She  Yeah  She even had her tubes tied  After the birth of her last child  Thirty four years ago  That came undead  They came untied  Wow  And that's why she got pregnant  Should have tied it in a square or not  Mm-hmm  I'm pregnant  But I'm gonna go have my heart dead  It's a racist  Racist country  It really is sickening  That she's not getting the coverage  That that other 
[02:39:00]  You know  Well plus the other lady's in New York  And she's Sleewer's sister  Don't tell me  That doesn't have anything to do with it  But it's just  It's really annoying  Yeah but that whole story  Was about how they found  The oldest lady to  You know  Yep  To give birth to twins  But now there's one that's older  How they fit two little berets  In her snatch  Before those kids came out  And the fact that this woman  The woman in the paper  Looks like  English from Escape from Alcatraz  The fact that  If you look at her face  There's an old man reference  1979  Obscure reference  What a loser  There you go  Ah  Ashley's back 
[02:39:30]  I defy the New York papers  To give her the coverage  You gave  Oh and the papers have her  As the youngest girl  To ever bang her father's friend  Ashley  Yeah  What's going on today  I'm in my parents' house  And I'm up in their room  On their bed  And I'm gonna blow them  And make them  When he's ready to come  I want them to come  All over their sheets  And then we're gonna leave  Okay  Hold on  The guy is there with you  Fred  Yeah  It took me a while 
[02:40:00]  To convince him to do it  But because my parents  Usually on Fridays  My dad doesn't work  We sat across the street  And waited for them to leave  They usually go grocery shopping  Afterwards  So why are you whispering  If they're not in the house  I don't know  I guess because I'm all freaked out  On doing this  See we're not  I don't know if we're  Buying your story  I know  It gets bigger and bigger  And worse and worse  As it goes along  And you know  It's so outrageous  That you know  It leaves us to believe  That perhaps 
[02:40:30]  It isn't really happening  Let us talk to him  Hold on  You sure do have a cast though  Hey  Yeah  Who are you?  Fred  What?  Fred  Fred  And you're the friend  Of the father  Uh huh  And you've been having sex  With this daughter  Yeah  What did the father do  When he found out?  He'd shit out of me  And how old are you? 
[02:41:00]  38  38  And you're banging  Your best friend's daughter  Yeah  And her father's 38?  I think  He's pushing 40  And um  Man I just don't know  If I'd buy this  It's so outrageous  That it's like  You want to believe it  Because it's so outrageous  But then  You kind of got to think  How can this possibly  Really be happening?  Hey Fred  If she gives you a Hummer  Will you promise  Not the sheets  Will you arc one on the pillow? 
[02:41:30]  I don't even know  If I can get it off or not  Oh you don't even know  You can get it off?  Get it off  Oh get it off  Now um  Wow what to ask this guy  How big is it?  What?  So you've been taking her  To the hotel huh?  Yeah  Yeah  And giving her  Is she hot?  Yeah she's hot  Yeah  So you've been looking at her  For many years?  I think she's about 16 I guess  16?  Yeah  And how bad did he get  Beat up the other day?  I got a black eye  Fat lip  What did he do? 
[02:42:00]  Like how did he  All of a sudden  You don't know what's happening  And you see the father  What pull up?  Yeah I didn't really think  Anything about it  And then he just  Busted in the door  And started beating  The shit out of me  So he came to your house  Did he say anything?  Uh just shit like you know  What the hell you doing  With my daughter  And stuff like that  And what did you say?  I just kind of  Crouched on the couch  And tried to cover up  Best I could  And took it like a man  Knowing what you were  Going to get later on  That night from his daughter  Right? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah  So you like that  Hot piece of ass  In front of you?  Oh yeah  A whole lot better than my wife  Oh yeah  Your wife  What happened to her?  She hasn't come on yet  Where was she?  She's in St. Petersburg  Man everything like adds up  They got the story together  It's so cool  They all had their story together  It's like a little drama club  This is definitely  Anthony and I have talked about  This thing that's been going on  On our show  For the last few days  And we're just not sure  What's real and what's not  Because it's so out there 
[02:43:00]  It's one of those things  I mean everyone's facts  Are kind of lining up  They're really prepared  If it isn't  Yes Sex Bagel  Ask him  The hotel they were  Talking about last time  Is it the one down the street  Or the one near the mall?

[02:45:30]  There's your mom  I don't think they heard it  There's your mom  I think we put an end to that story  Finally  Mr. Faber-sham  If you want me to be involved with the play  It's out of the question  Out of the question  Rachel  You sucked my cock  And your mom walked in  Your mom  Is  Back  That was awful  We wanted to believe it  Yeah but we  I'll give my  Are you a sex bagel?  I just called the number back  The mom's phone number 
[02:46:00]  Yeah  You just hear the phone come out  And you go  Ow my hair  You  And then it hangs up again  So they're still playing the act  They're still acting  Like we're gonna keep calling them  That's really funny  To see if this  The beautiful thing is though  And I'll credit myself  I didn't buy this from the first  From the get go  Yep  Yep  This is a bunch of bunk  Bunk  It was one of those things  That sounded fun  You wanted to believe it  But they really  Like their little acting crew there  They had their facts lined up  They were good  I didn't think it was real either  It was one of those things 
[02:46:30]  You know  It's kind of fun to listen to  Them making it up  And that was kind of funny too  Well for a while there  We weren't sure  Yeah it was  We gotta be honest  And then we were  And I were talking  We're like I don't know man  I was saying there was  A little element of doubt  That was the only thread  Holding it together  But after that  I mean come on  That ends it right there  That ends it  You know what really  Rubbed me the wrong way  And I noticed this immediately  Is that these two  Are supposedly fighting on the phone  And yet they tolerated  Every idiotic thing we said  Right right  The mother  You raised a slut 
[02:47:00]  Ho ho ho ho  Ho ho ho  Ho ho ho  A slut  I raised a slut  Mary  Right now  What they're doing  They're all clasping hands  And bowing  They were  Thank you  Well now they have to call back  And tell us what that was all about  Yeah just call back  We got the goof call back  Yeah we know you were kidding  It was fun  It was fun  They put on a nice little show  Absolutely  It was like watching a mini series  It was a good three day soap opera  Yeah  A vignette  And you know what  If you poll the audience 
[02:47:30]  I think over 50% were buying this whole thing  Until today  Yeah that was just awful  That was a huge discussion  On a lot of the message boards  You guys are tools  Why are we tools  Why are we tools  Stupid asses  Ever say donkey sausage  Why are we tools  We said just before  We went to the  You know the phone call  Or continue with the phone call  That we weren't sure  We were buying it completely  Yeah  Look at this guy  Too bad dad didn't show up  Yeah that would have been hot  Him and Fred could have got into it 
[02:48:00]  Damn you think they could have  At least gotten into the BJ  A little more  That didn't sound as fake  Yeah  Alright  Listener theater of the mind  Equals awful radio  If no one thought it was real  How did you confirm  That this was a real story yesterday  Good point  Good point  Someone  I think  Someone on this program  Did confirm it was a real story  Someone did say  They confirmed it  And it's a real story  And I think he's got  Frosted hair 
[02:48:30]  Was it sex bagel  That was confirming  That this was real  I think it was  Well we tried to confirm  By acting like a lawyer  And stuff  Yeah but they weren't  Going to fess up to anybody  I'll bet you  They were saying  Did you believe  That idiot acted like a lawyer  And he thinks we bought it  Oh yes  For legal ramifications  We knew you weren't  A real lawyer  Anthony didn't know  Any real legal terms  Look technically  There can be jail  Jail  Well sex bagel's  Working on him  Technicalically  Sex bagel I think  Is working on him right now  Not only that  The name of the lawyer  That I used 
[02:49:00]  Was Chuck Schick  Who was the lawyer  In the law student  In Caddyshack  Ah  That walked up  Introduced you to  Hey I'd like you  To meet Chuck Schick  He's going to law school  That's zero  Chuck Schick  That's good  I'll say  Mick Cage's performance  In Windtalkers  Was better than  That awful acting  Yeah that was horrendous  Oh it's your mom  Nothing  Yeah just  It's your mom  Yeah I know  Just perfect timing  It's your mom 
[02:49:30]  No  It's your mom  When I give you the signal  We're going to yell  It's your mom  All right  Oh I got it  Let's call up  And we'll say  That mom walked in  You know that's been  Bothering me for the last few days  So I'm glad there's an ending  But guy I tell you one thing  The only thing he almost tripped up  What color her hair was  Blonde  Brown  Blonde brown  Blonde brown  She was probably shaking her hair  In front of him  No I mean she couldn't have been  They had to  I bet you they wrote stuff down  Because you think  The age is right  Everything right 
[02:50:00]  The hotel location  Everything  All right  That was a  We have a new Monster Rain song  Good little show  Do we  Monster Rain  This Monster Rain thing  Has taken on a life of its own  It really is taking over  In the country  It's a hit  People love the Monster Rain  They love playing it  They love talking about it  Well you got  Imaginary Bill  And Pappy  Going back and forth  With their Monster Rain song  Pappy  So Pappy I think  Started it right  Yes  And then  Monster Rain 
[02:50:30]  And then  Imaginary Bill  They did the Monster Rain  That's really funny  That's my favorite so far  That was the one yesterday right  Yeah  So you know what  People are turning on their radios every day  So why don't we play the latest Monster Rain song  The Monster Rain  The one we had on the air yesterday  And then  We're going to go back to Pappy  Who came up with another one  Monster Rain twofer  There it is  You do me  I'll do you  They're dueling it out  They're dueling it out  Right  That's right  Get the seat out  All right so 
[02:51:00]  Dueling little plucked chickens  This was the one from yesterday  Imaginary Bill  And his Monster Rain song  And then  We'll come back on the air  And then we'll play the Pappy  The new one  Here I am  Out for his throw  Minding my own vampire business  Hey what's that noise  Under the porch  I better investigate  Oh my goodness  Stop that  Now I'm scarred for life  I was walking one fine day 
[02:51:30]  When I first saw  Two young eager boys  Hidden under the porch  One was little Jimmy Nottin  With eyes so round  He was on his friend's clutch  Making slurping sounds  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  The Monster Rain  And now his clothes are all stained  He did the rain  It caused him mental pain  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  With his little buggy eyes 
[02:52:00]  And soft little breasts  Young Jimmy saw that he was making amends  His hair was all sticky  But he kept his pace  Now we know why he likes hookers  To piss on his face  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  The Monster Rain  Little Jimmy was game  He did the rain  It caused him mental pain  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  The two boys were just having fun  The Monster Rain had just begun 
[02:52:30]  The other boy's father caught them and he said  Hey there, what are you doing to my son?  Hey young Jimmy  Let me tassel your hair  Why you're so sticky  And covered in sweat  Your spit-stayed cheeks are so very pale  When I just invent a game called  The First Night in Jail  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  The Monster Rain  Little Jimmy was game 
[02:53:00]  He did the rain  And now his clothes are all stained  He did the rain  He did the Monster Rain  Now that Jimmy's a little older  He must repent  That he has such memories  Of rubber cement  He should have protested  And stated quite plain  Dude, I'm not gonna taste your DNA  Oh no, you hear that?  Then at it again  Man, that's disturbing  I'm going to have to have my eyes washed 
[02:53:30]  Why would anybody even tell this story?  Little Jimmy Norton's a sociopath  Oy vey  Imaginary Bill  With the Monster Rain song  What's that?  From Hollywood  It's the most non-threatening black men on television  The Brothers Brothers  The Brothers Brothers?  Oh my god  Whose bit is that?  That's In Living Color, I think  An old In Living Color bit  What was that?  On the end of that CD? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah  Alright, I think Ashley's back on the line here  She's laughing  Ashley  Yeah  Alright, you guys gotta like fess up now  Because we're on to you  Okay  You remember  Do you remember on your  Look at them  They're all little  Look at this  It's a comedy  It's a comedy troupe  It's the  We're an improv group  It's the Upright Citizens Brigade  Everybody  Do you remember  Do you remember on your second show  That the second week of your show on Monday  A girl from Tennessee called 
[02:54:30]  And played with herself  With that  With that high voltage vibrator  Because I had dirty dreams about you  Yeah  Yeah  Well, I'm Nina from Tennessee  Oh, okay  And you actually emailed me a couple times, right?  How about I drove to Hazleton  So that Janice's number would register on your phone line  Are you crazy?  No, what, you could just forward it?  Yeah, we just totally wanted to mess with you guys  We were giving you a little bit of your positive women's promo  You guys had 
[02:55:00]  Problem with the promo?  Alright, let's back up  So you were the one from Tennessee that played with yourself, right?  Right  So was that for real?  Yeah, that was for real  So you had a real orgasm on our show?  Yes  Okay, alright  So then you guys  This is just totally because we just wanted to give you a little bit of women's positive promo  Yeah, that's positive, alright  Alright, so Ashley, how old are you?  I told you, I'm 32  You're 32 and you're acting like a teenager?  Yeah, yeah  And how about Janice, my mother?  Is 31 
[02:55:30]  Is 31  The mom  I can't believe  Hey, did you write stuff down?  No, I swear to God, we didn't write a nothing down  Nothing down, all improv  Yeah, all improv  Improv  And we did it over the phone  I was calling you guys from my Tennessee number  And when you guys were calling her, it was from her Pennsylvania number  Man  And we were just communicating back and forth by phone  And then Fred was actually my husband that you were talking to  Yeah, Fred ruined it 
[02:56:00]  I was just going to do true or false  Yeah, Fred's acting stunk  They want to try and trap you, but they don't ever give you true or false  I got to tell you, you know, there was a point I was believing it for a while  I think there was a point Anthony was for a little bit  I'm always completely skeptical  Skeptical, but  So there was that element of doubt the whole time  And I'm always fishing around trying to find out  I wanted to believe it  Oh, hell yeah  And then I got to tell you, the listeners, they're being honest on the instant feedback  And it's split right down the middle, right?  It was always split 50-50  We love your show  We love your show 
[02:56:30]  And the shit that you say about women isn't bad  I mean, hell  I know  What did you think of Anthony's lawyer impression?  I knew it was a crock of shit  Of course you did  Damn it  Yeah, I played right into it  Stupid Chuck Schick  Chuck ruined the program  I'm going to give you to Janice  She wants to talk to you for a couple minutes  I love you guys  Norton, you're a sweetheart  And I'll talk to you later  Okay, thank you, miss  Hello, this is Mom  Hey, Janice, how are you?  Good, how are you?  You guys were pretty good, I got to tell you 
[02:57:00]  Were we?  The first two days  We kind of wanted to go over the top today  So that everybody really knew  Yeah, there you go  No, you're saying that now  Because it went horribly wrong  The timing was awful  Oh, well, we didn't  Like we said, we didn't have anything planned  But it was, you know, three days of fun, you know  Yeah, well, we just figured, you know  Maybe you can get something you could use for a positive promo  That was great  We enjoyed that  And as far as you're not having women listeners  You obviously know you do  Well, can you guys make it up to us now 
[02:57:30]  And dyke out or something?  Dyke out, Opie  Or have Ashley get banged live on the show  I think you've got to make it up to us now  Yeah  Oh, yeah, we'll have to do that  All right  You know what was a little confusing for me?  We played a Hi, Mom  I'm in jail  Our old CD  Oh, no, that CD never came out  That's right  And, well, it's out there, though  And thousands of people are enjoying it  Thanks to file sharing  And OAVirus.com  But then she, you know, Ashley called up  Decided this is my opportunity 
[02:58:00]  And said, I want to do one of those  And that's when I was like  Well, if it was something planned  You know, the timing  You know what I mean?  I know, yeah  The timing was too good  Yeah, well, we tried to make it sound a little more real  But, you know, we're not professional  So  You guys at least made it seem professional  That Fred  That's the worst acting I've ever heard  I know  Fred was horrible  Yeah, we hated Fred  He made Voss seem like John Gielgud  Wow, nice  Nice  Good reference 
[02:58:30]  All right, guys  Okay  But we love you  And we're going to continue listening to you  We think you guys rock  Thank you  Stay away from the pranks  Or people are going to start thinking  We're doing fake radio  Okay, no, no, no, no  And tell Ashley she's got a bang now  Live on the show  Okay, we will  All right  Okay  Oh  There it is  Oh, you're going to get it  Hey, dude  Let me tell you  These chicks were real  Hey, it's Rock Hole  What's going on?  Me and Dave  Are calling these chicks again  Yeah, all right 
[02:59:00]  That was fun  We passed up to it  Cool  It was fun to listen to for a little while  It definitely had me wanting to believe for a couple days  I don't know  I don't think that's my cell phone  It's mine  Oh, it's yours?  No  Okay  All right  So where were we?  Oh, all right  So we have the brand new Monster Rain song  We've just played Imaginary Bill  Who challenged Pappy  And now Pappy  Pappy is coming back with his latest Monster Rain song 
[02:59:30]  Pappy  So this is the third song, I guess, right?  This is the trilogy  Yeah  The third of the trilogy  So it's Playing Monster Rain  As it's Singing in the Rain  By Pappy  No?  Oh, it's perfectly timed, too  Oops  Hold on a minute  Oh, don't worry, Opie  It'll play  No, I don't know if he wants to play now  There you go, Ben  That's great when you have to punch things to make them work  There it goes  I'm playing Monster Rain 
[03:00:00]  Just playing Monster Rain  What a glorious feeling  I'm getting blown again  I'll follow my friend  Down under the floor  His cock's in my mouth  And I'm playing the whore 
[03:00:30]  Let the stormy clouds chase  He and I to our place  Come on with the rain  I've got spunk upon my face  He'll go down on my vein  Reciprocating again  We're playing  Just playing Monster Rain  And there you have it, Pappy 
[03:01:00]  I like it  It's not bad, right?  Really good  Playing Monster Rain  Very funny  But I still like the other one a little better  That one's, you know, cute  The Monster Rain  I like the Monster Rain  You know what everyone's loving is the Silence of the Lambs musical  Oh, that's a real toe-tapper  Yeah  Why are you opening up packages in the studio? 
[03:01:30]  Could be an explosive device  What is that?  Wait until the break  I don't know  I started opening it  Well, now you can't leave the listeners in suspense, Ben  What's in that box?  Why would you bring it in here, though?  Because I don't have a desk  Because we don't have an office  That's right  I don't have a desk  But it's our problem  That's our problem that we don't have anywhere to work and solve problems  Isn't that funny?  Ben's got to come in during a break and open boxes because  There's nowhere else to go  We don't have an office  There's just nowhere else to go  Ben, please send out 18 emails on this  I've got nowhere else to go 
[03:02:00]  All right  Why don't we  You want to play  Yeah, we promised that last U2 song  Why don't we play one more U2 song?  Miracle Drug  And then we're going to play a real  And then we're going to do a real break so we can regroup, all right?  So  We're going to play  Yeah, we've been debuting tracks off the new U2 album  This morning  Miracle Drug  Debuting  Debuting  It's a world exclusive, Anthony  World exclusive  They use that exclusive word way too loosely  Exclusively exclusive  And you know what's funny?  Like so many stations on, you know, on regular radio all over the country today 
[03:02:30]  World exclusive  Oh, they've built all kinds of sweepers for us  It's a U2 exclusive  Wow  U2 exclusive  Only on the edge  U2 exclusive  If you use lasers in your promos, you stink  You know, I did radio recently  And I forgot how bad this can be 
[03:03:00]  The guy was great  It's just a station thing  But while you're talking  They have like a little bit of rock music playing under you  Just so the casual listener knows it's a rock station  Oh, yeah  The bed  It makes me sick  The bed  We used to have the bed at AAF  Is that what it's called?  The bed?  Yeah, we did the bed  I hate music playing under talking  Didn't we start not playing the bed?  And Bruce, he got all mad  B-b-b-boy  Boys, we have to keep the rock  That's how they actually made an excuse  They said, well, this is how we keep rocking 
[03:03:30]  Like when they say we rock for an hour straight or something  They can consider that bed part of the rock  The rock doesn't stop  See, we're still rocking even though we're talking  Our old boss was such an ass  Anthony and I decided to start talking  No one  The reality is we don't know how to do a talk show  I think people have figured that out by now  We just started talking  Because we were sick of all the crap that's on regular radio  And playing into the whole black party weekend philosophy 
[03:04:00]  And the two for Tuesdays  And this and that  And doing traffic and weather together on the 19s  Or whatever the hell they do  You know, so  The fact is  And I one day said  You know what?  I'm kind of bored here  Playing the same damn crap  Let's start talking  You know, that this music is so fresh and great  Even a Metallica song gets freaking boring  When you play it 200 times  Right  On your radio show  So we started talking  That's a fact 
[03:04:30]  No one told us  No one decided to groom us to be talk show hosts  We said, you know what?  No!  We're going to just start talking  So I'll never forget Bruce  Our old boss at AF  Comes walking  Boys  Are we doing a talk show now, boys?  Boys  We're doing all sarcastic  We're doing a talk show now, boys?  Boys  Is that what I'm hearing?  Yes, Bruce  What happened to the 12 songs in a row, boys?  Yes, Steve  I had to play his music 
[03:05:00]  He was in here so long  That's right  He was just kind of bumbling around  That awful shirt  So we just started talking  That's it  You know?  Boys  What are we going to do?  Have a talk show?  Well  Okay, Bruce  You said it  Yeah, we are  Yeah, Bruce  We'll do it your way  And continue making $60,000 a year  For the rest of our lives  I think we figured out the way it was supposed to be  $60,000?  You guys are making $60,000?  Yeah, right  I was  Nice  Because I used to make more than Anthony  I was making $27,500 
[03:05:30]  Hold on  I wasn't making $60,000 when you were making that  $27,500  We had like a $10,000 difference for a while there  That Anthony holds me to this day  $27,500  Which was $2,000 less than I was making in construction  So Bruce, you're right  We should stop talking and do it your way  You know, stay with me and you'll be making $30,000  Right  You'll be making $30,000 large  Yeah, we were going to get successful doing it your way 
[03:06:00]  Of course  Of course  Guys, can we play a little Metallica underneath the talking?  I kind of like that, actually  The bed  Alright, Master Poe is pacing out there  We're going to have to get all dirty in here  Give Master Poe a break  Alright, so we're going to do Miracle Drug U2  From How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb  The CD drops  November 23rd  Brand new U2 on the Opian Anthony show  I want a trip inside your head

[03:11:00]  I eat out alone  That's how all the freaks eat  They eat alone, man  I was at this restaurant  Downtown New York  I'm alone  This other guy's sitting at another table alone  This is the way he ordered his food  He goes  Yeah, can I get the veggie burger dinner  And I always get my check with the meal  Not you can bring my check with the meal if you like  I always get my check with the meal  I guess the waitress was supposed to say  Oh my God, I've heard about you 
[03:11:30]  You're the guy who gets his check with the meal  You know, it's been a crazy day  We had two napkin Tommy in earlier  And see that guy over there?  That's dessert before dinner Danny  What a great restaurant I work at  Full of characters  People always say 
[03:12:00]  Thanksgiving dinner  It makes me sleepy  Thanksgiving dinner  It makes me sleepy  You know what makes me sleepy?  Hearing about people's Thanksgiving dinner  So your mom puts ginger ale on the yams?  Fucking  You wouldn't happen to have a green bean story in you, would you?  Would you? 
[03:12:30]  Because I am all ears  This guy's ready to hurl his backpack in  Why are you holding on to him?  Afraid I might steal that?  I don't know, I seem to be kind of fucking around a lot  I don't want him to steal my shit  Weezer bootleg  Is that all true? 
[03:13:00]  Really?  God  I'm fucking  I'm a bright, bright, perceptive guy  I love tattooed women  I go crazy when I see a tattoo on a woman  I don't even care what it is  I can meet a woman like  Hey, what's that little tattoo on your shoulder?  Oh, this?  It's a soybean?  Of course it is  You know, at first I thought it was a Rice Krispie  But that would be ridiculous  See, I don't know, I just differ, you know 
[03:13:30]  Like, remember those summer trips you take with your folks growing up?  Remember those nightmare fucking excursions, you know?  Instead of doing that  Why don't families take mushrooms?  Stay home and trip together  Yeah, much better trip  The whole movies would be tons more fun  Just 20 minutes of someone's thumb 
[03:14:00]  You see, son, the thumb is opposable  That's why we can use tools and live indoors  Speaking of indoors  You get the impression the walls are breathing?  I do, mom  It's like we're all one consciousness 
[03:14:30]  Experiencing itself subjectively  There is no such thing as death, son  It's only illusion that we are separate beings  In actuality, we are all one  God is love, and love is all there is  And if that's all there is, there can be no opposite  Cool, Dad  I think that'd be such a neat trip  In a way, with your parents  I think it might be more than an eye-opener  I think it might be more than an eye-opener  Anthony Show  Right on, Fat Boy Slim, I do believe

[03:16:00]  I actually do like everyone I've met from XM  They're all fine people  Right  Just get us an office  That's all we ask  That's all we ask  All right, Anthony  We've got to get all dirty in here  And a lot of people walking around outside today  But really fast  There's another lawsuit because of a video game, Anthony  Oh, great  Lawsuit filed against  Wait, where's the other?  I copied it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Lawsuit filed against Sony, Walmart  Over game linked to shootings, Anthony 
[03:16:30]  You want to guess what game is involved once again?  Hmm  Back man  Back man  There's been a man running around yelling  Waka, waka, waka  Waka, waka  Thanks for ruining the bit  That's where we're going to go with this  Oh, I'm sorry  Maybe if you were in the  You didn't tell me, Albie  How am I supposed to know?  Maybe if you were in the pre-show meeting  Instead of showing up at 6 o'clock  You would have  I get up very early  We had a whole thing where a gorilla was  Oh, don't ruin all of the bits  Oh, alright  No one told me 
[03:17:00]  It's too late  We're going to try to go with it anyway  No, now I put the whole thing down  God damn it  Thanks, Jimmy  What did I do?  This was going to be our benchmark bit today  This was the one that was going to go on for 20, 25 minutes  People were going to email us and call going  I laughed so hard I almost drove off the road  But now it's just going to be a basic story thanks to you  Well, Opie, you've got to tell me these things  You've got your cute line out  One little Jimmy Norton line  That's fine  But it was going to be 20 minutes of Anthony just going off  I would have let that wucka-wucka thing on the table  I wouldn't have picked it up 
[03:17:30]  Why did you put it on me?  Yeah  Huh? What happened?  It wouldn't be 20 minutes on me going off  I didn't get mad when he saw my water impression  Because I have said the one thing  Because I have so much confidence in what you do, Anthony  That's why  Jimmy said the one line and you pretty much ruined the other  So I'm sitting here with nothing  No, we had that other line, though  About how the kid, you know, wants to, you know, get across the street  Right, right  And he got hit because he thought he could, like  Well, just tell that story  We'll see where it goes  I almost referenced that in a way because I did a wucka-wucka joke on Tough Crowd 
[03:18:00]  That Colin called me out for and destroyed me  Wucka-wucka  He silenced the audience and he goes, shh, shh, just let him sit there  He said, did you really paint your face yellow and yell wucka-wucka-wucka  And he sat down and looked at me  So it was a very uncomfortable moment  Yeah, well  I didn't know, all you had to do was tell me, look, we're doing this thing  Be quiet, I would have shut my mouth  No, it's not about being quiet  No, no, but I wouldn't have stepped on it  Lawson filed against Sony, Walmart, over game link to shootings  No, it doesn't matter  What happened?  Was the guy rolling barrels and somebody was jumping over them and tripped him? 
[03:18:30]  See?  That was going to be my brilliant line  That was the other one  How am I supposed to know?  Nobody tells me  You had Pac-Man Frogger  I had Donkey Kong  I had the Frogger line  Right  The Frogger line was going to be mine  Donkey Kong was mine  Where the kid's parents wanted to sue somebody because this kid tried to cross the street  You know, in the middle of traffic  And he would hop  He would hop forward a couple times  Hop back one  And then he got hit  And he figured out this is how to cross the street because of the game Frogger 
[03:19:00]  So they're suing him  So they're suing the makers of Frogger  And my guy has a lawsuit pending  He's an Italian guy  And he's got a lawsuit because some big ape was rolling barrels down  Donkey Kong or a Brooklyn reference?  Jesus  Because our own Earl  And the reason is because they're suing over an old video game  They're suing over a video game that was out years ago  And that's why the old video game references you dick 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, it would have been a scream  This would have been a best of bit, you ass  The old video games should have come into play after we did the story  Right  You bring them up before you do the story  It's like, then we go back to it  Right  I understand some of the hostages overseas  Their family are suing Pac-Man  Because they feel the insurgents are doing impressions of that  As they hold up just the heads  Oh my god, dude  That's not funny  I thought just the head reference would be 
[03:20:00]  Knoxville, Tennessee, Anthony  Knoxville, Tennessee  A $246 million lawsuit was filed against the designer, marketer, and retailer  Of the video game series Grand Theft Auto  By the families of two people shot by teenagers apparently inspired by the game  Aaron, 45, a registered nurse, was killed  And Kimberly, 19, of Virginia, also was killed  No, she was seriously wounded  When their cars were hit June 25th by .22 caliber bullets  As they passed through the Great Smoky Mountains 
[03:20:30]  Oh boy  Stepbrothers William and Joshua, 16 and 14, of Newport  Were sentenced in August to an indefinite term in state custody  After pleading guilty in juvenile court  To reckless homicide  Homicide  Endagement  And assault  They killed two?  Well, they killed one and seriously wounded the other  Outstanding!  They were shooting at cars from their perch, Anthony  They were Marines!  The boys told investigators they got the rifles from a locked room in their home 
[03:21:00]  And decided to randomly shoot at tractor-trailer rigs  Just like in the video game Grand Theft Auto 3  Hence the old video game references that we will now not do  Right, because it's been years and a couple of more Grand Theft Auto games  Yeah, we're up to Grand Theft Auto 5  But they're suing over an older video game  Over an old game  So now all the  Frogger references  I wonder what else  Donkey Kong  And the Pac-Man  You could sue over  From years ago  Hmm  Oh  I didn't realize that 
[03:21:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I heard that there's a family suing because someone was throwing big rocks at their spaceship  Ha ha ha ha  Pewm, pewm  Ha ha ha  Well, you know  See, right about now  We'd have been talking about the rolling the barrels down on Italian people  Yeah  Yeah  We would enjoy an extra hour of sleep too  But  Another Italian guy injured his head jumping up and hitting a box so a coin would come out 
[03:22:00]  Right  And he's suing  Suing the makers of Super Mario Brothers  But, um  You brought up the Pac-Man thing a little early  I didn't know  I'm sure we would have had a  We would have had a Pong reference too  It happened  We would have fit that in there somewhere  I had a Glaxon joke would have knocked your socks off  Right  I can't think of any other video games with creatures in them  I'd love to contribute  We were going to talk about Centipede as well  Oh, Centipede  Now it's lost  Wah wah wah wah 
[03:22:30]  Wah wah  So  It's a whole  Uh  Thank God someone says this  There's no credible evidence that violent games lead to violent behavior  No  That's  They better just throw this out  Alright  And  These kids simply decided to take the thrill of that game out to Interstate 40 and started pointing at cars  See that's where you draw the line  You don't sue the game  You lock up the lunatics that are doing it  Cause  I defy you to find one out of a couple of million people that play a game 
[03:23:00]  That decides they're going to go out there and shoot up cars  Just never thinking of the consequences  It's so much fun to do it in the game  Well, there you go  We'll just cross that little  Cross that off  We'll cross that bit out  Could you just make a little note  Bit  Ruined  Ruined  And  We had it marked down for 20 minutes of fine air time  Instead it's 3 minutes of awfulness  But you got your great line out  You have to tell me those things 
[03:23:30]  Cause that's what I do  If someone says something  I'll just chime in with a little  Hey  Sue about that yellow guy  I'll walk a walk a walk  The little Asian head that bounces around  Alright, well  No emotion whether he's being chased or eating power pills  He doesn't care if he's eating a piece of flute  Or just  Bouncing around with those little hairy things  Hey, they brought the Christmas tree to Rockefeller Center, everyone  Oh  Jim  Wish I knew where you were going with that  So I could squash it immediately  It's a big deal every year  They find a stupid tree somewhere in upstate New York 
[03:24:00]  And they bring it to New York City  Is this filler?  Because we didn't have it  Oh, hell yeah it is  Hey, how about that tree?  Yeah  They had  This year  It was a little different though  They had heavily armed guards  That's the spirit of Christmas  Gotta love that  Alright, well  That didn't work  Maybe we could do a Christmas carol  With guns involved  That's a big tree, huh boys?  Yeah  It's green  Well let's get all dirty in here  Gun  I don't like standing there 
[03:24:30]  I like standing here  I get weird when I'm over there  You don't have to move over  I did before  I wish you would move out of the freaking studio personally  Well, I don't want to leave the studio  I like being here  Waka waka  Why don't you just waka waka  Maybe I can just waka waka  Maybe I can eat dots on my way to my 57th street  You ass  Gobbled dots  That was  You know, we circled bits  Like this is going to be the one they're talking about all weekend  Here it is  Here it is  Oh well  I just didn't know  Now what are they going to be talking about today?

Why?  Well, I don't want the brother to break my neck or nothing 
[03:25:30]  You can have a drink  Wait, why is Mr. Poe saying that  Hey, it lights up and everything  Oh, yeah  It plugs in  It comes out at five degrees  Old Dirty, please don't steal the Jägermeister machine  We just got that  Poe ain't no joke, dude  We told you  What do you  You think we're lying?

[03:26:30]  No, that's not true  Earl caught you trying to steal a computer  What?  What are you talking about?  What?  Earl was just pissed because he was too lazy to try to steal it  You know what I'm saying?  He wanted to go 50-50 on that  Now I'm going to have to drop time on Earl, man  It wasn't a laptop or nothing  I tried at the tower  Well, you know  Could that stinger actually motivate you enough so you'd, I don't know, work?

[03:27:00]  Yeah?  Yep  I got the skills  What kind of driver?  I transport things that need to be transported  He can never tell what he does  He can't just tell everybody what he does  That's why I love this confrontation between him and Master Poe  They both know their job  Yeah  Know your role  They both know their business  Mm-hmm  Master Poe does not like you  No, no  I think he does  I think he does  There's no like or dislike with Master Poe  Disrespect  It's not a like-dislike thing  It's his job 
[03:27:30]  He's professional  Yeah  And he will do his job  He would punch you and knock you out  He likes you  But if he came down to part of his job involved that  He would do it without blinking an eye  Yeah, alright  So what do you got today, Old Dirty?

Download  The telephones or  Nothing  Well, I wanted the phone cards  I know you wanted the phone cards  All right  Remember there used to be the cell phone scams  Where if you started using your phone in New York  Like a month later  You'd get your bill  And there were  $10,000 worth of calls to Ecuador 
[03:37:00]  Because they'd read your phone  But they kind of fixed that, I guess  Yeah, they fixed that  How would they read it?  I don't know  They have some kind of device  And when you turned your phone on  If your phone was on  And you drove into the city  And you're making calls  You were fine  But if you turned your phone on  In the city  You would intercept it?  People would have  Yeah, they'd have these devices  They'd scan your number, dude  And it's a wrap  And then  Before you know it  Yeah, they'd stand in the corner  With a cloned cell phone  And they would  Collect money from the people 
[03:37:30]  And there you go  Five minutes  Ten minutes  What about scanning the credit cards?  Oh, that was another one  They were doing for a while  And you got caught on that one  I got caught  It was some guy that worked  At that stupid  Jekyll and Hyde's restaurant  Down the road  Went down there  And  It was a huge story  In the papers  Front page  And Anthony was one of the victims  Of that  Yes  He had one of the handhelds  You never let them  You never lose sight  Dude, as soon as they come out  With that handheld  Yo, get my car, man  What you doing with that?

Was it somebody down there?  Oh, yeah  They knocked off all charges  They're good with that stuff  They know what happens  But you know damn well  It was the whorehouse  No, because there was  A lot of restaurants  The whorehouse might not  I would think  You would pay in cash  You could do that too  But I like  Credit card  I like  You have to pay for the girl  I like leaving a paper trail  On my whore  You know what I mean?

Yeah  Ugh  And there's Kevin Straley  We're meeting with Kevin  In 15 minutes  So you better hurry up  Kevin should lean over  And just start choking Jay  Yeah  Making out with him  That'd be really funny  With that little  Gray beard on him  That stupid 
[03:46:00]  Sea Everett  Coop face  Makes me sick  ESPN2  If you're listening to us  Live  Cold Pizza  So he's gonna come  From this  Yeah  He's coming from this  Yeah  He's downtown then  Aw we better not have to  Wait too long for a meeting  Well you'll wait as long  As it takes  Until he gets here  Because you guys have  Really been annoying  Washington  I thought Elo  Was supposed to be  On this too  Well Elo  Would have been  A much better choice  Than Kevin  I mean nothing  Against Kevin  But he looks too nice  On this show  And he probably won't  Shut up about the  God damn Red Sox 
[03:46:30]  And there's Michael Harrison  Who loves talking about us  In Talker magazine  Why does he hate you guys  Or likes you  No he's actually been  Pretty cool to us  Over the years  I hope so  It looks like Jeffrey Tamborn  With the  We're watching TV  With an Einstein wig on  Yeah  We're watching TV  It's just  Whatever  Maybe we'll get the audio  Played on Monday or something  One more story  Old Dirty  What do you think of our  Buddy Bill Maher  With the African princess  Yeah babe  Well I didn't see that  Let me pick that  Execuses HBO star  Physical abuse 
[03:47:00]  Degrading racial comments  Aw  Comedian Bill Maher  Was slapped yesterday  With a nine million dollar  Palimony suit  By an ex-girlfriend  Who alleges that  The HBO star  Subjected her to  Physical and verbal abuse  Including insulting  Humiliating  And degrading  Racial comments  Kevin looks like  He's got his  Back to school haircut  As a kid  You know he got that haircut  Just for TV  Because he's going to be  On TV today  Wow  How long has McGreevey  Been working for XM Radio  Jesus what a sissy 
[03:47:30]  Oh you're terrible  Oh wow  That was really funny  I would love to know  What he's saying right now  But you know  Just the same way  That  I mean  Going back to  Opie's story  Just a quick comment  The same way  For a black man  A white woman  Was like  Oh that's the prize  I guess for a white man  A woman of color  Yeah  Is also a prize  Because of the thickness  Involved  And  The thickness  I'm not 
[03:48:00]  Incorporated  When you went to Brazil  My man  This thickness there  I'll be honest  There was a lot  Of really nice dumpers  You gotta be careful  Down there  Because the tranny operations  Are so good  You gotta watch  What are you kidding me  One place in the world  For sexual reassignment surgery  Maybe he's applied  To John Hopkins  And been refused  So they go to Brazil  And make a million dollars  Yeah they do  That's where they do  All the surgery down there  Because there's no  Regulations down there  They just you know  You take a needle  Off the street  And just shoot it  In someone's tits  With silicone in it  There's no medical regulations 
[03:48:30]  So the sexual reassignment  Surgery is very good  Down there I hear  And it'll look like  A regular badge  And then  I'm so paranoid  About that  I pointed to a bunch  I used to be a guy  They're all like  No you didn't  I mean yo  The good way to do it  Is like  Take a sniff  Do it  If it smells like fish  We're in there  If it don't  We out  I mean you gotta smell pussy  Right  Pussy smell  Pussy got a certain  Maybe the girls you're with  What the hell is that  I mean alright  It's not gonna smell  Like a fish market 
[03:49:00]  But  In fact  A vagina has a certain  Funk  That gets a brother funky  Like I smell it  And I'm like  Ooh I wanna hit that  You know  Oh yeah baby  You know what I mean  You know what I'm talking about  I know  I do  I mean  I like the armpit smell  On certain girls  I'm a real pervert  Are you serious  Certain girls  Only chemically  It has to hit me  But there are some girls  I'll lick their armpits  If they're sexy enough  Yo Naughton  A couple of days ago  This girl was like  Ooh um  You know  I was  I was  Banging on this shit  And she was like 
[03:49:30]  Oh put it in my armpit  That's senior  Axelism  That's what  What is that  Axelism  What's that  When you don't show up  For your gigs in Philadelphia  Until three hours late  And your wig fell off  Psychotic has been  Fuck  You fucking  That's crazy  You so lost me on that one  Wow  Axel  Oh Jesus  Wow  Sorry  Licking armpits  But he won't eat  Out of that fucking bowl  That someone  I won't put my mule  In an armpit  That's disgusting  It's silly  And there's gonna be 
[03:50:00]  Stubbles  Axelism is when you  Have the fetish  Of having sex  With armpits  So she was like  Oh put it in my armpits  So I'm like  I'm behind  She really wanted that  Dude I was all up  In the armpits  Was she doing this  The whole time  It was all up  In the armpits  Was she doing this  He he he  He he he  Raised her elbow  Up and down  And went  So I was like  You  That's a little laugh  A little chuckle  Oh that's funny  But the arm  I was bugging out 
[03:50:30]  But she was  I guess  Very freaky  Do you mind  Hairy armpits  This one  Domination  I know  Has hairy armpits  And I'll actually  She doesn't wear deodorant  Oh my god  I swear to god  I'll smell and lick her armpits  Actually  Holy Jesus  Stop it  Wait a minute  Wait wait wait  Holy Jesus  Palomino  You're kidding  No  You're kidding  No  A girl  With unshaven armpits  That doesn't wear deodorant  You lick  Her hairy armpits  This  Is an extraordinarily  Rare thing  For me to like  There's maybe  Three or four women 
[03:51:00]  In my life  I've met  That turn me on  Like that  There has to be  A certain chemistry  On most people  I would find it  As revolting  As you do  Chemistry  Yeah  For me  Chemically  If a body scent  Hits me like that  It's very rare  That it does  But if it does  I can do it  But on most women  I can't  You are an animal  You are like  An animal  With these smells  I can just see you  Like putting your nose  Up a chick's ass  When she comes in  Before you pay her  And then doing that dog 
[03:51:30]  Lick thing  That they do  And the other one  Will turn around  And look like  Hey what are you doing  Back there  And they'll like  Put their hindquarters  Down a little bit  And then they do this  You creature  It's the pheromones  Of course it is  Exactly  Yeah kid  There you go  You know what I mean  It's eximacational  Well good  Dr. Old Dirty  Enlightening us  It's the pheromones 
[03:52:00]  That is really twisted  The armpit  But again  That's such  It has to hit me chemically  It's not like  Some chicken just show up  Like that  Because most of them  Smell awful  It's like  Ugh  But occasionally  You'll get one  That just really hits you  Oh  The ass smell  Can be really hot  See he likes  Only on certain girls  Sometimes it reeks  And it's disgusting  I just hate the smells  In general though man  When a girl  You've got a good time  When a girl's been peeing all day  The girl's been peeing all day  Yeah yeah  And it's trapped in there  That smell  That's funky right there  That urine smell  You lost me  Smells like bicycle seats 
[03:52:30]  That's the funk baby  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Anything else you want to get off your mind there?  Wow  Damn bro  Not really  Nothing  Nothing coming to my  Yeah  My man Ben is the best dude  He's feeding the Jaeger  Pretty good first appearance  I must say  Very nice  Am I getting positive reviews?
