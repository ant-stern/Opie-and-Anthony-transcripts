<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts declaring themselves "radio shock jocks," emphasizing their rejection of "nice" radio.  They immediately launched into a discussion of their "WoW" (Whip-Em-Out Wednesday) stickers, detailing various iterations and designs, with Anthony showcasing his Paltalk ban privileges, comparing himself to God. This led to graphically detailed descriptions of women exposing their breasts while driving, categorized by breast size and method.  A caller reminded them of a "window cling" sticker version.  The hosts then promoted their upcoming comedy show, promising abundant "WoW" activity, announced a contest winner, and segued into a discussion of the film *Fargo*, spurred by Opie's girlfriend's aversion to violent movies, specifically citing her reaction to *The Shining*.  The conversation detailed graphic scenes from *Fargo*, including the woodchipper scene.

The topic shifted to Matt Murphy, the catcher of Barry Bonds' record-breaking home run ball, and the tax implications of its potential sale.  This sparked a broader discussion on taxes, their complexity, and perceived unfairness. A caller then claimed to have avoided paying taxes for twenty years using a deceased baby's Social Security number, a claim met with shock and amusement from the hosts.  Next, the conversation turned to Gene Garofalo joining the cast of *24*, prompting speculation about the show's future and commentary on Janine Garofalo's appearance and comedic style.

A significant portion of the show focused on their intern Craig becoming trapped in an elevator.  This became a running segment, with live updates from the hosts, a reporter named Danny at the scene, and numerous callers offering theories ranging from global warming to terrorism.  Craig progressively removed his clothing, ending up in his underwear.  Danny's attempts to obtain security footage were thwarted by a "Building Douche" who denied access.  The segment included graphic descriptions of elevator accidents and deaths, along with unrelated tangents, such as a report of outrage from Van Halen fans over a possibly false tour cancellation announcement leading to an online feud between the fans and Opie & Anthony on RothArmy.com. A transgender woman, Michaela, called in to discuss her transition, and another caller made racial remarks.  The segment concluded with the arrival of an elevator mechanic and an unresolved joke about Craig.

The show then tackled the Michael Vick dogfighting scandal, focusing on what the hosts perceived as poorly written and inane commentary from sports figures like Vick and Stephon Marbury.  They also criticized a *Wired* magazine article that called them "twits," engaging in a phone call with the author, Steve Knopper, during which they aggressively challenged his assertions, using extremely offensive language and accusing him of being uninformed. Knopper eventually hung up.  Other topics included the South Carolina prison system's use of pink uniforms for inmates involved in sexual activity, MyFreeImplants.com, a butt cam in an Arizona clothing store, the potential DeLorean comeback, and a humorous segment featuring individuals stating their names and quirky interests.  A planned interview with Jim Norton was mentioned, and there was discussion about the show's control board.

A later segment heavily featured the Michael Vick case and the NAACP's response, focusing on a bizarre statement made by NAACP representative Arnold White ("many people love my dick"), which the hosts repeatedly replayed and mocked.  They debated the NAACP's response, questioning their selective outrage and perceived racial bias. The conversation veered into tangents on dog euthanasia, opinions on Arnold White, and crude exchanges about the hosts' genitalia. A "lines of the day" segment featured listener-submitted statements, and Opie promoted his Barnes & Noble appearance.  The entire broadcast incorporated frequent profanity, sexually suggestive humor, and offensive remarks throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  A shocking thing that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Orioles, shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  He knows something.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball!  Oh, nice! 
[00:01:00]  Oh, that was mad.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Rockin' on a Wednesday.  A whip-em-out Wednesday.  That's what they call it.  We got WoW stickers here in New York City, finally.  Our home station finally got the brand new WoW stickers.  Where are they?  I don't know.  I want to see one immediately.  E-Rock, please.  Thank you.  Let's see.  All right.  Are they a little small this way?  Yeah.  The updated WoW sticker looks a lot like the old WoW sticker. 
[00:02:00]  Just changing the call letters once again.  Yeah.  There are so many WoW stickers out there with our names on it.  And the WoW.  And then just a multitude of different stations and platforms.  In New York, this will be the fourth WoW sticker that will be on the roadways.  Yeah.  You got the WoW sticker from the WNEW days.  I see those occasionally.  It's like, ooh, old school.  You got the WoW sticker from XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  There's a bunch of those out there.  You got the WoW sticker when we were doing Free FM here in New York City. 
[00:02:30]  All right.  And now you got the 92.3 K-Rock WoW sticker.  That E-Rock is showing on PalTalk in his disgustingly pixelated picture.  Oh, no.  He did it.  Why does he fix that?  Because he's got to restart it.  And he should always start it and then restart it immediately.  Start it twice.  Look at that.  And the people at PalTalk go, thank you, Anthony.  You're welcome.  I feel like the Lord sitting up here at PalTalk.  Let me kill someone. 
[00:03:00]  I'm like the Lord.  The what?  Watch.  I'm just going to kill someone.  Bounce.  Gone.  Look.  That's the power I have.  You just effed up someone's day?  That's it.  I just moved their day.  They decided they were going to sit, listen to the show, watch.  I just decided for him what he's doing.  He ain't doing that.  For no reason.  So there you go.  92.3 K-Rock WoW stickers are made.  And it'll confuse everybody in the New York area.  Doesn't matter what station they're from.  Because it all means the same wonderful thing. 
[00:03:30]  You put it on your vehicle.  You drive around.  The lovely ladies see it that listen to this program.  They pull up next to you and maybe give the little lift.  Maybe it's a one-handed lift while they're steering.  Boof.  Nice.  Maybe they steer with their knee and do the two-handed lift.  Whoa, that's really nice.  The two-handed lift usually means lots of goodness is going to fall.  It just falls out of the bottom.  The girls that have, like...  Oh, like the bottom coming out of a box that you're carrying out.  Just flomp all over the floor. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, girls with the itty-bitties, they're not using two hands for the presentation.  Well, they could steer and one little hand just goes, bloop, look at me.  But the other ones, they've got to steer with their knees and...  They actually got to do that flip maneuver with the shirt.  They can't even pull it straight out.  They've got to go down and out.  Yeah, they're actually working their triceps as they release those babies.  They're, like, locked into the shirt.  It's some, like, procedure they have to go through.  I love saying, why don't you release those babies? 
[00:04:30]  Release the hounds.  And then there's the other one.  In the summer, where they're wearing something a little low-cut, where they could pull down the neckline and prop them up with the neckline of their shirt.  They pull down the neckline way underneath the breast and then let go.  And they go, whoosh.  They kind of get pulled up.  And then they drive.  By the way, Craig from New Jersey.  We've got to go to him right away here.  Craig, go ahead.  He's going to remind us.  Yes, Craig.  I just want to remind you.  How could you guys forget the original WOW sticker that's, you know, that beautiful one, that static window cling piece of crap? 
[00:05:00]  Let me tell you something.  The window clings were invented, oh, boy, at this point, I would guess eight years ago, maybe nine years ago.  Our WOW window cling.  I've seen one in the last nine years.  Oh, yeah.  And we've been back here in New York, obviously, for about nine, almost ten years now.  They're collector's items.  Those things flew off the cars years ago.  But you're right.  There is a fifth version of the WOW sticker that could possibly still be out there in the New York area. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Watch out, boys.  The god-awful window cling.  The window cling.  And if you don't think WOW works, of course, WOW stands for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  For everybody in the New York area, if you're going to the PNC Arts Center for our big comedy show this Saturday night,  you will see lots of WOW-ing on the way to the venue.  So much WOW-ing goes on.  You will see lots of WOW-ing in the parking lot.  And you will see some WOWs going on during the show.  But you've got to sneak those.  You've got to be sneaky with those.  It happens. 
[00:06:00]  Because I don't know if that's legal in the venue.  Something is legal.  Hey, let's take care of the people that are up early, all right?  Congratulations to you, somebody.  You're going to win a pair of tickets to the Virus Tour at the PNC Bank Arts Center on Saturday, August 25th,  courtesy of Blades of Glory on DVD and stores everywhere Tuesday.  August 28th.  Good for you.  877-212-ONA.  We'll take a random caller right now.  Speaking of movies, last night I decided to watch Fargo. 
[00:06:30]  That's classic.  I haven't seen Fargo in a long time.  That's a classic.  And Lindsay goes, is this a funny movie?  And I said, yeah.  Yeah.  It is funny.  So she sat down all happy like she was going to watch a comedy.  Oh, boy.  And then I realized, oh, wow.  Yeah, there is a lot of violence in this movie.  Well, she doesn't like violent movies or scary movies.  No, my girl doesn't like the violence or the scary.  You're right.  Yeah, The Shining just freaked her out.  Yeah.  Like, we were dating.  Early on, we were dating, and I put The Shining in. 
[00:07:00]  And she was still at that stage in our relationship where, you know,  she's just trying to be, you know, just uber cool.  I said uber.  So what?  Who cares?  They hate when I say uber.  You're elite.  Then say it more.  Uber, uber, uber, uber, uber, uber, uber.  Say it as much as you want.  Uber, uber, uber.  I hate when I use crutches on the radio.  Anyway, where, you know, the relationship is you're just trying to be ultra cool. 
[00:07:30]  You don't want to give away your foibles and quirks.  Right.  So I go, hey, you want to watch The Shining?  She goes, yeah, I've heard a lot about this movie.  I've never seen it.  I'm like, I've never seen it.  So we sat down and watched The Shining, and halfway through,  not even halfway, like 20 minutes in, she, and I don't know her that well at this point.  She is up and about doing my dishes in my apartment.  She is so freaked out that she just left the living room and went and did, like, busy work. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, what are you doing?  Because I think she, you know, got up to get a snack or a beer or something.  I don't know.  Don't you hate when you say, do you want me to pause this?  And you're like, no, no, no, no.  I'll be back.  Just keep it going.  You're missing it.  That's fine, yeah.  You're missing it.  Right.  So she's up just doing dishes during the showing of The Shining.  I'm like, all right.  There's a problem there.  Yeah, there's a little problem there.  Figure that out later.  So last night, we decided to watch Fargo, and she goes, is this a comedy?  I go, yeah, it's a comedy. 
[00:08:30]  It's funny, man.  Load of laughs.  And I'm like, and then I remember the violent thing, and I'm like, ah, there's one scene  in the beginning that sets up the whole movie where it's a bit violent, but that's about it.  What?  And then I realized I haven't seen the movie in a while, because I'm like, holy crap.  I got shot in the face.  There's some violence in this movie.  The woodchipper scene where the leg is still sticking out the top, and the bloody snow and  the blood mist flying out of the thing.  Oh, that's a great one. 
[00:09:00]  That could be one of the goriest scenes in movie history.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Wade.  So you're with the funny looking one.  Yeah.  I have a little snow globe with that in it, with the woodchipper with the leg.  Oh, really?  That's good.  Oh, that's awesome.  I just could never bring myself to throw it out.  I'm like, that has to be this.  Well, these are some sweet numbers.  What a scum.  That guy was such a bastard, the father.  Oh, we'll give you your finder's fee.  Yeah.  Boy, you didn't expect us to give you the money. 
[00:09:30]  We're not a bank, you know.  We're not just going to lend you the money.  Since you can't go ahead with the deal, you mind if we go ahead with it?  But that's my deal, Wade.  That's my deal.  That's my deal.  That stupid Norm.  Norm's just a good guy.  He is a good guy.  Taking care of Margie.  Yeah, I'll make you some breakfast.  Okay.  Remember she meets up with the Asian guy she used to go to school?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we were talking about that in the office.  He has a thing for her.  Yeah.  It was so weird. 
[00:10:00]  And just starts crying.  That just came out of nowhere, too.  It really didn't have much to do with the movie.  Nothing at all.  Francis McDormand was so great and awkward in that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that's one that if that pops on and it's on cable, because I can't stand watching it on regular TV.  It always goes on.  All right.  Hysterical movie.  It is a comedy.  Hey, we're also talking about this baseball in the office there. 
[00:10:30]  What's his name?  Matt Murphy?  Yeah.  Matt Murphy's from Queens.  He was out there in San Francisco.  He caught Barry Bonds' record home run ball there.  The one that surpassed Hank Aaron.  And he has to sell the thing.  He doesn't really want to sell the thing right now, I don't think.  Yeah.  But the government and the IRS, they're coming after him.  It seems that he has heard through how many people?  Several people. 
[00:11:00]  Several people told him he would have to pay taxes on it.  Yeah.  I hope he checked and really found out what the deal is with that, because I have no idea  what the actual deal is.  But apparently, people are saying that if you have this ball and it's worth a half a million  dollars, let's say, you have to pay taxes on it, on the value of that ball, or the perceived  value, or the assessed value, or whatever the hell value they could come up with.  This poses a problem, because what the hell is the ball worth?  That's what I was going to ask.  Who decides the value of the ball? 
[00:11:30]  It'll change over time, whether it's up or down.  What if you're one of these creeps that, you know, you want the baseball just so you can  take your morning you-know-what's on it?  Yeah.  So wouldn't that make the value a lot less than the person who's deciding the value to  be?  Yeah.  What if you hate Barry Bonds and you wanted to destroy the ball?  Right.  You just burn it.  Taxes on something you want to destroy?  Then can you take it as a loss, based on what their assessment of the value was when it  was good?  Can you then take that as a loss and deduct it from your taxes?  See, do they allow that? 
[00:12:00]  Government allows you that.  But it's one of those situations where I think it's like a stock.  When you buy a stock and the stock goes up in price, you don't have to pay taxes on it  until you sell it.  It's just paper value.  And then when you sell the stock, you got to pay taxes on it.  I don't know what the deal is with a baseball, why you have to shell out this tax on a perceived  value of the baseball.  But this also brings up another thing where the tax the rich thing. 
[00:12:30]  Everyone loves to scream tax the rich and says this Republican thing where they protect  the wealthy.  And that is always the battle cry of everyone until they start making a few bucks.  This guy was probably in the stands probably all the time, didn't want to be taxed at all  and tax the rich.  They could afford it.  And then the second he caught that ball, hey, wait a minute.  I'm rich now.  What the hell are you talking about?  I don't want to pay taxes. 
[00:13:00]  Damn poor people.  I'm a Republican now.  The IRS just sucks, though.  But why do they have to get involved with something as they are a viable, a worthwhile organization  that is needed in this country, Opie?  Look, I pay my taxes.  I pay a lot of taxes.  But why do they have to get involved with a wholesome thing like baseball?  Well, it's not that wholesome.  Wholesome.  Theroids.  I know.  Whatever.  That's why they have to stick their hands in your pockets.  Why?  Right.  They have to do it.  They're like crooks. 
[00:13:30]  They have to.  I don't care.  I pay taxes, too.  A lot of them.  It stinks.  I pay my taxes.  I hate paying taxes.  I'm doing the receipts now.  I've got to save a receipt from everything.  Yeah, of course you do.  I've got to write down, this is a business dinner.  I went to lunch with Club Soda Kenny, and we discussed the virus tour.  It's business.  Yeah.  It really has gotten out of hand.  And just the way it's written, it's become so incomprehensible to your standard human being 
[00:14:00]  in this country that you need to go to people to have them do the taxes, and there's no  way to change the tax law.  Like, people are always saying, let's change the tax law.  Let's have a flat rate.  Or someone comes up with this revolutionary, huge idea that'll completely change the tax  structure of the country.  And it never works because it's so ingrained.  It's like a tumor that is wound around the spinal cord.  You know those tumors that they say, we just can't cut it out.  It's just in there too deep.  That's what our tax system's like right now. 
[00:14:30]  There's no just eliminating it.  You see the paperwork?  Do you see the copies that we get back every year when the taxes are done of what the accountant  went through?  It's amazing.  And that's one guy.  It might as well have been written in Japanese.  And it's a book.  When we pay our taxes every year at this point, these forms hold on.  It's folders upon folders that are the size of books that come in, and you can flip through  it all you want.  You're not understanding one word in there. 
[00:15:00]  No.  But that's how it is.  It's purposefully done, so you can't understand it.  This is the same reason the law is written a certain way, so they have a purpose.  What was it?  Steve Forbes wanted to do 17% across the board.  Make $100, you pay $17.  You make $10 million, you pay $1.7 million.  That's fair.  You know who screamed about that?  Who?  The people on the bottom end.  I don't want to pay 17%.  I make $20,000 a year.  Why can't it just be straight across the board?  That's fair.  The better you do, you're paying more. 
[00:15:30]  $3,400.  Yeah, exactly.  It's 20% of us.  That's 70% of $20,000.  Yeah.  I'm Rain Man.  There you go.  It's probably cheaper than you're paying now.  I just...  And I never understood this.  You pay your tax on your income, and then the money you have left is after taxes.  And then everything you buy is taxed.  Everything.  It's like, wait a minute, but you taxed this money already.  You taxed it.  Why am I paying tax? 
[00:16:00]  I...  I...  Time to dust off the old muskets.  It's just ridiculous.  The old muskets.  A well-armed militia.  Yeah, time to get our muskets together.  What's the argument people use about paying income tax where they say that you don't have  to pay income tax because it's not written anywhere that you have to pay income tax?  Oh, but you do.  That's a big load of crap.  There's these people that go around that say that they use...  They quote some kind of constitutional amendment and say that this right here proves that we  don't have to pay taxes, but it's all crap.  You got to pay or you go into jail. 
[00:16:30]  That's how it works.  Income tax I have a problem with.  Income tax is horrible.  It's just...  It's...  It's...  It's fleecing you.  Right.  It's just...  I don't like having a partner in my work.  I don't see a government agent sitting here putting out the ha-has every morning.  It's just a pain in the ass.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry we started the show by talking about taxes.  I really am.  Taxes.  But we're not.  I think we made everyone depressed.  We got lots to do today.  Don't worry about it.  So this poor kid, he's got to like sell them... 
[00:17:00]  It's not even poor kid.  He's going to make some good money off it.  But it's just dumb that he's got to...  It should be his money though, man.  It should be his money.  If he sells it for a half a million, they're saying this ball is going to get all...  You know, obviously it's one of the most valuable balls ever sold at auction.  He should be able to keep every single cent of this.  Because it was done in his leisure.  I don't know.  In his leisure.  His leisure.  So he's selling the ball.  That's one of the headlines today.  Once he sells it, he's going to have to pay taxes on that. 
[00:17:30]  And then whoever buys it, are they going to have to pay taxes on the...  Oh, of course.  How can they tax things so many times over?  They just keep taking it.  They never...  Aren't they embarrassed?  Wouldn't somebody be at the government go, all right, look, we can't keep asking.  Go ahead.  Just see if they just do it.  I'm sorry.  We really look silly now.  And we left the motherland because of a lot of this stuff, obviously.  I would love to see a comparison of, like, what we left and where we are today.  Well, it's the old analogy of... 
[00:18:00]  They did this very slowly over time with taxing us.  If we went from the way it used to be in ye olde days here in this country, where you're taxed on what you own, things like that.  The assessor would come through.  There was no income tax.  And then they went to what we are taxed today, there would be a revolution.  People would freak out.  But it's the analogy of if you put an animal, like a frog, in cold water and slowly turn the heat up, he'll just sit there until he dies. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  But if you throw him in boiling water, he'll freak out.  They have turned the heat up on us so slowly that we've reached this point where it's like, wait, we're where?  Oh, my God, this really sucks.  But, you know, no one's ready to start a revolution over it.  But it's too late.  You just pay.  It's too late because your skin's turning red.  Yeah, exactly.  You're boiling.  You just, you pay because if you don't, you'll go to jail.  Well, here's a guy.  But it was done slowly enough where we didn't freak out.  Here's a guy that hasn't paid taxes in 20 years. 
[00:19:00]  Eric in Texas.  All right.  Eric, what's your address?  What's that?  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Eric.  What's up?  Haven't paid taxes in 20 years.  In 20 years, yes, sir.  Now, how do you get away with that?  Well, what you do is you use a fake Social Security number.  You basically create one, either like you make one or you take one from somebody who died, like a baby.  And then you just kind of use their name as like your person.  And then you pay, you work or whatever. 
[00:19:30]  You get the checks.  You take the checks.  You cash them.  Everything's fine.  But you never have to pay taxes because the IRS, you know, goes to that person.  He doesn't exist.  That sounds very practical.  All right, cool.  Well, here's what we're going to do.  I'm going to give up my name, Jim Norton.  I'm going to find a dead baby.  Take his name.  I don't know where I'll find a Social Security number.  I'll knock his parents' door.  Hello?  What's the little fella's Social Security number?  It's kind of a rough sell, dude.  Just pass by houses where you see brand new cribs at the curb for the garbage men. 
[00:20:00]  You know, I mean, you can find them in all places.  Look, but how does that work?  Because doesn't the IRS still have a Social Security number that is making money?  Whether it's real or fake, they are looking at an SS number that is making an income.  Exactly.  So if they go and investigate over it, you know, it's under a different name.  What about the address?  Don't they come to your house? 
[00:20:30]  Well, no.  I mean, you can do direct deposit.  Well, eventually they're going to find out.  What about your name?  What about your name?  Isn't your name on your checks that you cash that have the other Social Security number?  No, no, no.  The name is on the other person.  It's the dead baby's name.  Right.  So you take dead baby's name.  How do you cash dead baby's name check?  You have dead baby ID and everything?  Well, yeah.  You'd have to have some sort of identification.  I mean, you have to have the Social Security card. 
[00:21:00]  Do you endorse all your checks with crayons?  But it's semantics.  It's like you've just changed your name and Social Security number, but you're still the guy they would go to.  It's still your address.  They'd say, where's dead baby?  And you go, I'm dead baby.  I'm dead baby.  In simple terms, that's exactly it.  You're dead baby.  So they're looking for you now.  Yeah, they're looking for dead baby.  And you're dead baby now.  Right.  Do you lose your identity completely for real?  It's silly.  No, I mean, you still have your identity.  I mean, you have two identities. 
[00:21:30]  So people at work think that you're Melissa, and yet everyone else knows you as Eric.  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know if dead baby works.  I don't think dead baby works.  I think eventually they find you.  Of course.  They find dead baby and go, hey, you're going to jail for a while, man.  Even if they don't.  Well, I mean, even if they do.  I mean, they have a different person in court.  They would be questioning a different person.  But it's you.  Yeah, you're dead baby.  So you'd be in jail going, ha-ha, but I'm not really in jail.  Dead baby's in jail.  Right.  But you're the one taking it in the shower. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  All right, Eric.  From yourself.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  That's just.  He's insane.  I don't like.  We get the insane callers early on.  Crazy.  I think we overpay in taxes, but I'd rather pay taxes than steal an infant social security  card.  I know.  And be him.  A dead infant.  It's just morbid.  You're despicable.  How many other.  How many Yates.  How many Yates.  Are out there working right now under the guise that they're not paying taxes.  All right.  No more tax talk today, please. 
[00:22:30]  Tax talk.  Really fast.  Just a question.  How many other people said, well, I'm not watching 24 anymore.  What?  24 is a hot show out there.  A lot of people love the 24.  Gene Garofalo is joining the cast of 24.  Gene Garofalo.  Yuck.  What does our resident 24 fan.  Travis.  Here he goes.  Fan boy.  He was bummed.  So I'm thinking there's a lot of other people out there going, why are you wrecking my show?  He wears.  Gene Garofalo joined the cast. 
[00:23:00]  Let me give you a little background on Travis.  He wears a Bauer Power t-shirt.  It rules.  He is a Jack Bauer fan.  He loves Kiefer Sutherland.  Doesn't.  Who doesn't?  Come on.  I love you, too.  Oh, I hope.  He enjoys looking at his bare feet in photos.  Kiefer's bare feet.  You see my picture with Kiefer?  I have.  Little fella he is.  I got mine, too.  Yeah, he's short.  I wanted to hug him and just give him a noogie and go, ah, you're not your father.  Yeah, he's short. 
[00:23:30]  He's only like 5'11".  I think.  He's not short.  That was just a quick joke.  Van's laughing because to him it is.  Oh.  So what do you got on this, Gene Garofalo?  Yeah, what do you think?  Janine Garofalo joining the cast.  Personally, I don't like her and I don't think it's a good fit.  They're usually really good with their casting, so maybe they know something.  Why are they doing this?  I have no idea.  Is it a gimmick to keep the show going?  Are people losing interest?  Last season wasn't as good as the rest.  Oh, boy.  Jump the shark? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know if it jumped the shark as much as they just didn't finish all of it.  Is she going to play a feisty female agent who is the foil of Jack Bauer?  They're completely redoing it this year.  Oh, boy.  They're bringing in Oliver.  Yeah, we'll see.  It's over, Johnny.  It's the Oliver into the Brady Bucs syndrome.  They're bringing in Oliver.  Nice.  Well, you'll always have the box set.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  So, Janine Garofalo, you're just hating that move, right?  I'm not excited, yeah.  I'm sure she'll bring some of her political humor into it. 
[00:24:30]  It's so funny.  I love how she just riffs on stage and looks through her notebook.  She has a notebook on a stool.  Just trying out material, you guys.  She should have her notebook on a stool sample.  Know what that loose-leaf book is all about?  I learned this from Jimmy.  Not as far as Janine Garofalo, but comedians in general.  They do things on the stage because they don't want to commit. 
[00:25:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's a lack of confidence probably in the material.  So, it's like, if I bond with this material, even though it's material, I feel good about  that I've been practicing and honing for a long time.  It's in a notebook.  It's like I'm doing it for the first time.  I'm just trying out material.  I can turn the page and go, all right, that won't work.  And the crowd laughs.  Right.  But she wants all that material to work.  It is her best stuff.  But to her, she's presenting in a way like, I'm just going to try some stuff out here. 
[00:25:30]  I hate that.  I bet she's hairy.  I just bet she's hairy.  Like, everywhere.  Her arms.  I bet she's got, like, the thick, hairy arms.  And then, you know, I'm just, I bet, wow.  Wow.  Speculation, but maybe Jack Bauer will get to the bottom of that one.  I hope not.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're getting started.  The phones are lit.  We get to see Janine Garofalo get killed. 
[00:26:00]  Is that true?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Is that a spoiler already?  Who knows?  It's Opie and Anthony on this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Not a fan of this tune.  To all the O&A pestis.  Pestis.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You don't like this song?  Why?  You know why?  I'll tell you why.  It's not a bad song, but this is an on-purpose riff.  Like, you can see them going, look, I came up with a riff.  And it's like too, too much like they were looking for a riff. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but at least, look, I got a riff.  At least they're going back to trying to find riffs in song.  Yeah, there's a lot of guitar in this song, I know.  But this seems a little too calculated.  We went through a period where they were just strumming along, really.  I don't like this calculated riff.  Making a lot of fuzzy noise.  Now we're getting back to, you know, you can play a little air guitar with the music today.  Calculated riff.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  A couple quick things to get to. 
[00:27:00]  Tim, one of our production guys, came up with this thing here.  We don't know what it means.  Sam and I, I'm a people baby.  Another James Brown baby.  She's about to do that.  Opie and Anthony.  He handed this to us during the commercials.  I don't know what it means.  What does that mean?  What the hell was that?  Did James Brown have another illegitimate child or something?  But he's dead.  That's pretty much it, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  What?  His DNA confirmed that he has another child.  Oh.  That's it.  Having your weekly eating session?  Skinny.  Have to do it during the show?  So, is this a new case or the other case?  What is this?  That's a new case.  He's licking his fingers.  What were you eating?  It's a tasty cinnamon.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  But sticky. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And really fast.  Craig, our intern, is stuck in an elevator somewhere.  Craig.  Yeah, what's up?  Are you really in an elevator?  Yeah, I really...  I'm in the XM elevator on the fourth floor, and it just decided to become out of service  when I got in.  So now you're in it.  Now I'm in the elevator.  I'm sitting on the floor, and I'm playing with a rubber band that I broke five minutes  ago.  He's already losing it. 
[00:28:30]  What?  Does anyone know you're in the elevator?  Yeah, for a good ten minutes, the guy at the front desk was cleaning outside.  Oh, stop.  I wouldn't get in touch with him.  What's he going to do?  Throw feces at it?  That guy's useless.  What now?  Like, are you in between floors?  I really don't know.  Just the lights is four, and I've been pressing lobby, and the fifth floor.  You know, he's the guy that would just die in there.  Wait.  No initiative to do anything. 
[00:29:00]  Do they know you're in the elevator?  Yeah, they know I'm in the elevator, but I have to wait for the elevator company to  come and get me.  Oh, dude, please do us a favor.  Take all your clothes off.  Just take all your clothes off, and when that door opens, there's going to be a lot of people  outside that elevator going, oh, man, I had to take my clothes off.  I've been in here for hours.  I was dying.  I was dying from the heat.  I already started with my sweatshirt, which I folded about five times already.  Now, I was just talking about elevators last night. 
[00:29:30]  Don't they have a trap door, or what do you do?  There's so many movies.  You're really not supposed to do anything.  People will come and get you.  It's very dangerous to pop up there, and it's dangerous to pry the doors open and try  to get out.  People have been killed because they've been stuck between floors, and this is a gruesome  way to go.  We had a case like this happen a few years back.  A guy was between floors, and there were other people in the elevator.  He opened up the floors. 
[00:30:00]  He put his hands up.  Opened up the doors.  He put his hands up on the floor that's about midway up through the door and went to boost  himself up to crawl out.  He got his fingertips and his head out, and the elevator started going down.  Guillotine.  Just lopped his head off, and there was a body without a head on it.  The head just kind of rolled forward.  And then another one happened the other way around, where the guy tried to get out through  the lower half and lower himself down, and the elevator moved and chopped his head off, 
[00:30:30]  and a woman, the lights went out.  The last thing she heard and saw was his head leave his body, and it hit the basement, and  now she's laying there in the pitch black with the guy's head laying in the elevator.  What movie was that in?  Not kidding, because I remember reading it, and it was gruesome.  Yeah, find the story.  What did he say?  It was that fast.  Find the story.  I don't believe you. 
[00:31:00]  Find the story of the head in the elevator.  You either got that from a video game or some horror flick.  I've heard that, actually.  I have heard that.  Yes.  I saw a photo of a guy, a doctor, who got cut in half.  This is why I never try to hold the doors open, even getting in on a healthy elevator.  Once in a while, those sensors don't work, and when that door closes on you, and old  Mr. Elevator goes up, you're in deep trouble.  I'm terrified.  I always have this urge when the door's closing to stick my leg through it, just to see if  it closes on my leg.  How awful would that be to try to push my leg out before it got cut off going on? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Well, what are we going to do with Craig stuck in the elevator here?  Craig.  Start a fire in the building.  So, how do they communicate with you, that you need to wait for the elevator company?  There is an intercom.  Have they been talking to you?  So, dude, dude, ring the intercom.  I want to hear what the guy says.  Talk to him.  Say, I'm really getting panicky in here.  Yeah.  Say, how much longer?  How much longer?  I'm getting panicky.  Tell him you're running out of air. 
[00:32:00]  Tell him you're running out of air.  Oh, my God.  You can hear the casualness in the guy's voice.  Like, hang tight.  Dude, tell him you're running out of air. 
[00:32:30]  What's that alarm?  Tell him you're running out of air.  Not one.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel like this element is closing.  I can't be in here, Watt.  Ring the alarm to the tune of YYZ by Rush.  Do that. 
[00:33:00]  So, Craig, what are you going to do?  I don't know.  I've been, like, pacing back and forth.  Not very far.  It sounds like they don't even give a crap about you.  They're taking it so casually.  They still are trying to get a hold of the elevator company?  Yeah, supposedly they've been on their way for 20 minutes.  Hang in there, Craig.  If you're what I think you are, you know that people are coming for you.  But that story about me trying to pry the door open and trying to get out, 
[00:33:30]  that actually kind of freaked me out a little.  Craig, do you have to take a dump?  Yeah, I would take a dump in the corner and say, hey, I had to.  Craig.  Yeah, I would leave a little something-something.  Do you have to take a dump?  Not really.  I'll try to.  All right, well.  Hey, you know what you do the second the elevator repairman gets there?  You shoot the repairman.  You refuse to get off the elevator.  That removes the rest of the planet from the equation.  So you're just sitting there playing with a rubber band? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I lost it now.  I don't know.  Well, I kind of lost it.  There it is.  How did you lose it?  That elevator is really small.  He's like in prison and he found like a little mouse to play with.  Something to play with.  Something to play with.  Dude, what would you do if the fire alarms went off and you started smelling smoke?  Oh, I don't know.  I would freak out.  I would start breaking everything in here.  That's good. 
[00:34:30]  That's a great sensible plan that you have.  Do you see a hatch up top?  What's that?  Do you see some kind of a hatch up top?  Yeah, I already checked out the top.  There are two tiles that look like they are removable.  Yeah.  I just pushed him and I can't push him any further.  You have no survival skills whatsoever.  No, none.  All right.  You have to get out of there this second.  What do you do?  Go.  I would climb on the beam and just start punching the top. 
[00:35:00]  I'm just pushing it very lightly.  Well, you have every right to push those tiles and see what's going on up there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I do.  Actually, hold on.  Go ahead.  See what's up there.  Dude, people are saying you can call 911.  Don't waste their time.  They're busy.  Good point.  All right.  I got to figure.  Hold on.  We could tell, you know, we have a lot of, you know, we have a lot of fans out there that  he is in the Steinway building on 57th Street.  Yeah.  Just giving his location. 
[00:35:30]  Just bang on the door and laugh at him.  Oh, shit.  You can't.  You can't curse.  Hey, Craig.  Well, he is stuck in an elevator.  We got to cut him some slack.  What are you upset and cursing about?  Yeah.  Why are you cursing?  Hello?  Yeah, I hear.  What happened?  Right now, I'm actually standing on top of the little, the handle that people hold on.  Yeah.  The railing that goes around the elevator.  Yeah.  Trying to push at the top.  It's not coming.  So the tiles aren't moving? 
[00:36:00]  No, nothing's moving.  God, I always thought there was a little tile that just moves and then you got a little  escape hatch.  And then you can climb up the elevator cables.  Yeah.  Then you climb the cables.  And then a big explosion happens.  And then all of a sudden the elevator starts moving and then it's a race against time.  I understand you're freaking out.  What was that? 
[00:36:30]  What was that?  That's one.  You can see there's a counter in here.  You can see me climbing up on the top.  And what is he saying about that?  What's that one?  And what?  He has a problem with you climbing around the elevator?  Yeah.  He's telling you to not climb?  Oh, man.  Please start screaming.  Oh, no.  Get out of there. 
[00:37:00]  Get out.  Get out of here right now.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll check in with you in a little while.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Max from Dallas is making a good point.  I know where he's going with that one.  All right.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  How's it going, boys?  Good.  I'm wondering if that elevator repair guy was like Anthony was right before he quit doing  AC work because that guy is going to be sitting there for a long, well, goddamn time. 
[00:37:30]  He'll be there until noon.  You don't think an elevator guy wants to get up early to get our intern out of an elevator.  He doesn't care about the intern in the elevator.  Yeah, he's out driving the company van around.  That's it.  Listening to this show.  I wouldn't want to get out of the truck.  Yeah.  Punch it out, boys.  Wow.  All right.  Some good elevator stories that just came in, man.  Yeah.  E-Rock, what's this?  I have a video clip of a guy getting killed by the elevator, losing his arm as the car 
[00:38:00]  shut.  Stop.  No way.  This is on LiveLeak.  LiveLeak.com.  That's the old ogre.  No way.  Is there audio to this?  Oh, my God.  That can't be real.  Oh, my God.  They just pulled an arm out.  Holy jeez.  Look at that arm.  It's still got the finger pointed out for the old button.  Pushing the button.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  The guy is smashed. 
[00:38:30]  Just imagine what we're looking at.  Happening in some...  Ah!  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It looks like...  The funny part is the guy's little teeth hanging out.  Yeah.  Dude, it's not funny.  I can't look at crap like that.  The guy's head is great.  Wow.  The guy's head, he's laying on his back.  He's like...  The kind of look you'd have if an elevator smashed your skull.  Like, what?  It's very surprised.  And his head is split in the middle.  And a piece of his brain is hanging out.  Oh, my God.  And you can see his head has just been caved in.  What makes this sort of okay, you can tell that this happened somewhere far, far away. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, God.  He is smashed.  Yeah.  They showed a video of, like, an arm sticking out of the elevator.  And you're thinking there's somebody attached to the arm.  And then he pulls the arm.  Yep.  And it was just an arm.  Dude, what's the story behind that?  Did they give a story?  Because it looks like he fell and then got crushed.  Hey, Craig, we're looking at horrific elevator accidents right now.  Oh, that's horrific.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Oh.  Oh, well, this didn't work. 
[00:39:30]  Smushed like a...  Like a bastard part like an eggplant.  It's a stuck in the elevator report.  I love how he uses the hacky production voice.  You know, one of our guys is stuck in an elevator.  Stuck in the elevator report.  Hey, Craig, thanks for shutting down our show today.  We're just sitting here wondering what the hell is going to happen to you.  I don't know what's going to happen to me to tell you the truth. 
[00:40:00]  All right, hold on.  We got Buddy in New York.  He's an elevator constructor or something like that.  What do you got, Buddy?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's going on, man?  Tell this idiot to stay in there.  He's going to jump out.  He's going to cut his hands off on his head.  Yeah, he's staying put.  He's going crazy, though.  He's just kind of playing with a rubber band right now.  No, listen.  Check it out.  Listen, he's not going to be able to get out of there because it's bolted up top.  Right.  Just tell him to stay put.  And when the guys come, who should be union, that's my union, local one, just tell him 
[00:40:30]  to stay put.  And then they'll come get him.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Punch it out.  Thanks for what you do.  Hey, Craig.  Yeah.  How long have you been in there?  I've been in here since 6 o'clock, so I don't know what time.  Almost an hour?  Dude, you're going to run out of air.  It's all right.  You'll feel euphoric at first.  Yeah, you'll just...  And happy and giddy.  And then you'll just go to sleep and not wake up.  It's kind of like water boiling, like Anthony was mentioning a little while ago. 
[00:41:00]  It's just going to slowly happen.  You're not even really going to notice that you're running out of air.  Don't worry about it.  You'll get all kind of woozy and crazy, and everything will seem funny, and then you'll  just go to sleep.  Yeah, the last thing you'll remember is that you were sleepy.  Is that what happens when you run out of air?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I thought you just were like...  That's how I feel right now.  No, carbon dioxide is different than like carbon monoxide.  Hey, let's go to Philly.  You don't get a headache.  No, I think you're just like gasping for breath.  No, you would...  I don't think you'd gasp for breath.  You just kind of... 
[00:41:30]  You kind of get all woozy.  And just doze off.  Let's go to Ricky in Philly.  That's not off.  Listening on WISP.  Ricky!  Oh, hey.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, if you patch him through to 911, have the fire department come and get him out.  Nah.  For an hour, he's hyperventilating.  They'll come right away.  I would not waste 911's time on something an elevator guy can fix in a little while.  If he was in danger, that's one thing.  You don't waste 911's resources on stuff like this. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, what we'll say today is he's in the Steinway building here in New York City.  A building that's being sold.  It's in the paper today.  Yeah.  I think they're selling that building.  And if you're buying it, look at elevator repairs.  Those elevators are ancient in there.  I got to tell you, that stupid Poe.  I was in that building last week checking out the construction of our new studio when we  finally...  What?  What happened, Craig?  He's yelling.  I think they're trying to communicate me in between floors. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, okay.  What are they saying?  They asked me what floor I'm on.  And I said that.  Well, first they said, Craig, are you alive?  And I said, yes.  Craig, are you alive?  Yes is a good answer.  Good answer.  But I was in that building...  I was in that building...  Sorry.  I was...  I was in that building last week, and Poe was like, yeah, this elevator's been acting  up.  And I'm like, yeah, whatever.  It's Poe.  What does he know?  Jesus.  But for once, he knows something. 
[00:43:00]  Acting up.  He said it was acting up.  Yeah.  And I'm like, yeah, whatever.  He goes, hopefully we'll make it to the fifth floor.  I'm like, of course we're going to make it to the fifth floor.  These elevators don't really break down.  Not in this day and age.  They stopped for a minute or two.  Sure enough, it's broken down less than a week later, and our intern is stuck in the  elevator.  How's it going?  Are they yelling for you still?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What was it?  Are they yelling for you still?  He's running out of air.  He's running out of air.  It's obvious.  Craig.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Are they yelling for you still?  Yes.  What are they saying?  I couldn't...  I can't really hear them.  I'm not only hearing the elevators going up and down.  Like people just...  Oh, they're using the elevator.  They're going to work.  They're using the elevator right next to you.  People are passing you right by, right next to you.  It's kind of like life, isn't it?  Hey, why don't you give out a little, you know, distress signal here.  Why don't you give a big, big, big help and... 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Say help.  I'm stuck in the elevator.  Hello!  Yeah, hello works pretty good, actually.  Hello.  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  No, no.  Oh, so Hugh Junit...  Hugh Junit is suggesting you do a rock scream.  Do a rock scream from the elevator.  Yeah, with the little air that's left in the elevator.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Rock scream, Craig.  What did he say?  I think that was Mars, because I'm not doing good radio.  Oh, that was Mars?  Very loudly sing Chocolate Rain.  Yeah.  Get off this rain!  See, this one, he'll think he's just going crazy. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Chocolate Rain.  Rain.  Elevator stuck again.  Chocolate Rain.  Oof.  Where'd that rubber band go?  All right, Craig, we're going to have to take a break.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hopefully, you'll be out of the elevator after the break.  Yeah.  I have a couple of enchanting stories when we come back.  Some real gems of elevator mishaps.  Oh, really?  Oh, it should be a sitcom.  Yeah, well...  All right, Craig. 
[00:45:30]  Blacky elevator mishaps.  Whoops-a-daisy.  Starring the severed half a skull.  Hey, can we send one of our guys to the other building to report live on Craig's rescue?  That'd be good.  Yeah, get someone else on a cell phone.  With a video camera.  Maybe Danny.  Danny would be good.  Or E-Rock.  Whoever you want to send there.  Yeah, get a video camera, too.  Yeah, get a video camera.  Get a cell phone.  I want a report.  I want a live report of Craig's rescue today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:00]  If you're just tuning in, we got our intern, Craig.  He went over to the other building.  And he's stuck in an elevator.  I hope he's not...  I hope there's no love in an elevator.  Imagine they open the door up and he's taking care of himself.  Yeah, we want him to do some self-loving.  So the rescuers have something to look at when they finally open up that elevator door.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Hey, yo, please find out what company Craig's cell phone service is with.  I'm switching to them. 
[00:46:30]  No kidding.  How is he getting cell service in the middle of an elevator?  In a stuck elevator.  He must have an iPhone.  Also, Pat from Menaki, he writes,  Have Craig start singing some blood, sweat, and tears.  What goes up must come down.  That might help.  And then Crisco from Grand Rapids.  He could bang on the sides of the elevator and yell,  I'm not an animal.  Let's see what Craig is up to here.  Hey, Craig.  Yeah, what's up?  Still stuck?  Yeah, I'm still stuck.  I talked to Juan during the break. 
[00:47:00]  The elevator guys are still on their way.  On their way?  Officially, you've been stuck in the elevator for an hour.  You know that, right?  I don't even know time right now.  He doesn't know time.  Right now, I'm laying on the floor, staring at the ceiling.  What happened to the rubber band?  You got bored with the rubber band?  Yeah, well, the rubber band broke within the first five minutes.  Oh, man.  That's a shame.  I already counted all the tiles in the elevator. 
[00:47:30]  How many are there?  There's 16 on top, 36 on the bottom, and five around the walls.  Don't you have anything else to play with?  I have my iPod, but I want to be able to talk to someone if they're trying to get to me.  Yeah, I understand.  Well, Craig, you took off your sweatshirt already.  I think it's time to take off your shirt.  My shirt?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think we're going to just slowly but surely take articles of clothing off your body here. 
[00:48:00]  We want you completely nude when the rescuers come.  Of course, yeah.  That's the big get.  I mean, you can keep your underpants on if you want.  All right, my shirt.  Off.  All right, his shirt is now off.  Danny has left the building.  He's on his way to this other building to see what he could do for Craig.  Jimmy, you had some horrific elevator stories or something like that?  You were saying before the break?  A couple of real doozies.  I don't know where I put the hair goes.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what I said about that doctor, it was a doctor actually.  It was true. 
[00:48:30]  The guy, he tried to get on an elevator and he got caught.  It closed on him and began going up and he was outside the elevator and it severed, I think, above the jaw, his head.  Oh, above the jaw.  And there's a woman named Karen Steiner who was a physician's assistant.  She was on the elevator.  She had jumped on.  She said that it had been out of service and the sign had been taken off.  So she got on the elevator, she pushed the button, and this guy tried to get in the elevator when the car was closing. 
[00:49:00]  And as soon as she saw he was trapped by the doors because the doors closed on him, she hit the emergency stop button but was unable to do so before the rising elevator had partially decapitated the doctor.  Oh, my God.  It kept going and it finally stopped between the fourth and fifth floors and she was trapped with his cranial remains.  We were able to get her on the phone.  And right now I'd like to say hi to her. 
[00:49:30]  What's her name?  I'm sorry.  Oh, her name was Karen.  Karen, you're on the air.  What was that like?  My God, that must have been horrendous.  Oh, my God.  Still.  Yeah.  That's better.  Oh, it was better.  Oh, well, she still seems to be a bit upset about it. 
[00:50:00]  That is exactly what would happen.  Of course.  You would just sit there screaming with the top of his head from his jaw up.  That's what was laying in the elevator with her.  I wonder if his hair was still neatly combed.  Of course it was.  Those are the things you would notice, too.  It's like, look at his part.  Dandruff.  So just the bottom half of the jaw is gone.  The rest of the face is with you, right?  His head is there.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Imagine it's had a clean cut.  Stuck in an elevator. 
[00:50:30]  Now I'm in the elevator.  It's a stuck in the elevator report.  Okay, Anthony.  Wow.  Hey, Craig.  Yeah.  What's going on now?  Nothing.  Time kind of stands still when you have somebody stuck in an elevator.  Hold on a minute.  We might have some help for you.  Let's go to Pat in New York. 
[00:51:00]  Pat, what's up?  Hey, I'm an elevator mechanic.  I work for BP Elevator.  I'm down on 34th Street.  You want me to get him out?  I don't know.  I don't know what the building's doing for this poor kid.  Well...  Get me out now.  He's saying get me out now.  He's panicking a little bit.  What's the address of the building?  Well, it's on 57th Street.  It's the Steinway building.  The Steinway building on 57th Street?  Is that by 6th?  Between 6th and 7th?  Yeah.  Yes.  Good call.  All right.  I'll head over there right now. 
[00:51:30]  I'm so glad we have so many listeners in New York.  We've mentioned the building a bunch of times.  There's not one soul outside that building yet.  Hold on.  We've got Danny in the lobby of the building that you're stuck in there, Craig.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What do you know, Danny?  Well, I can't tell you how exciting it is to be here.  I'm waiting for the elevator company to arrive.  Hold on.  Danny is on scene waiting for the elevator company to arrive.  You hear it here first.  Danny. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  How are things going?  Well, we're here with Danny now in this terrible elevator tragedy.  Craig, the intern, stuck in the elevator.  Danny is now on scene.  This Fox News alert.  Danny, you're on scene in the lobby.  What's going on?  What can you tell us?  Well, Craig has now taken his shirt off.  Craig has taken his shirt off.  Wait.  Wait. 
[00:52:30]  Can I ask Danny how he knows that?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Danny, we're going to switch to Opie now.  Opie has a question for you.  Well, I've got to play my sweeper first, though.  Oh.  Stuck in an elevator.  Giving it up when I'm going down.  Now I'm in the elevator.  Giving it up when I'm going down.  I'm in the elevator till I get the ground.  It's a stuck in the elevator report.  Opie and Anthony.  We have Danny on the scene there.  Danny, how do you know that Craig has his shirt off?  Well, I got an exclusive peek at the security monitor.  And I noticed in the footage that Craig was removing his clothing. 
[00:53:00]  Could you videotape some of that security monitor footage?  We certainly did.  Yes.  Yes.  This just in.  We have video coming in soon to our newsrooms of the actual security camera that features  Craig the intern stuck in the elevator with his shirt off.  Amazing story developing.  You heard it here first on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a stuck in the elevator report. 
[00:53:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Danny, anything new you could tell us?  I'm sorry, say it again?  Anything new you could tell us?  Anything that has developed since we last spoke?  Yeah, I'm probably missing my breakfast.  People now are hearing people starving, going hungry because of this horrible elevator tragedy  in midtown Manhattan.  It's a stuck in the elevator report. 
[00:54:00]  Opie and Anthony.  So people are starving is what you're saying, Danny.  Yeah, absolutely.  I also know that there's been no contact with the elevator company, and it's now been over  an hour since they were contacted.  Wow.  As time just goes by, we don't know when this tragedy will actually end.  It's a standoff.  It's an elevator standoff.  Our own reporter's now on a hunger strike until the elevator company gets there.  Stuck in an elevator. 
[00:54:30]  Now I'm in the elevator.  It's a stuck in the elevator report.  Opie and Anthony.  We got Craig, the intern, who is stuck in the elevator.  Craig, can you hear us?  Craig.  Yes, I can hear you, and I'm having trouble breathing.  All right, he's running out of air.  This is horrible.  I hear they're drilling a shaft down to your elevator to lower a camera down, and perhaps 
[00:55:00]  a monkey with a sandwich.  I'm looking forward to that sandwich.  Hey, Craig, you don't have your shirt on, right?  No, my shirt's completely off.  Craig's shirt's still off.  All right, time to remove the shoes and the socks.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  And Danny's going to confirm if you're doing it, because we can check out the security camera.  I can't wait to see the security camera footage. 
[00:55:30]  Jimmy, what do you got?  You got another elevator tragedy story thingy?  I noticed that they seem to happen in hospitals a lot.  I guess I'm going to guess because those elevators are so used.  Here's a gem.  On July 21st of 2003, 76-year-old L.A. Brown was killed in Louisiana when the gurney on which  he was being transported to surgery and became trapped against the roof of an elevator when  the car suddenly dropped several feet as it was being wheeled out. 
[00:56:00]  And the car drops and he gets stuck to the roof.  And on May 7th, this is a good one, 56-year-old lady died in similar fashion when the car her  gurney was being rolled into suddenly went up, dragging her to the fourth floor and back  down to the first floor between the car and shaft wall.  Oh, my God.  A dirty shaft wall on a gurney just going to try to have corns removed or bunions scraped. 
[00:56:30]  There's not much room there, I wouldn't think.  I think we're ready for our press conference.  So if you have any questions, we'll be taking your questions right now at 877-212-ON-A.  Oh, what's going on?  What's going on?  Craig!  Yeah.  What's all the yelling?  Butcher just asked me to get him a water.  What?  Butcher asked him to get him water.  Oh, really? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Are you getting thirsty in there now?  I am getting tremendously thirsty and I'm sweating profusely.  Do you have to tinkle at all?  I mean, I would.  Yeah, I have to.  Yeah, I have to pee.  What's the protocol?  Well, it's very important when you're in a situation like that.  You've got to keep your muscles kind of loose and stuff.  So, Craig, I think you really need to do a little exercising now because this could be  a while.  I think you need to do a few laps around the elevator screaming, help me.  A few laps? 
[00:57:30]  Just a few laps around a tight seat.  Well, Danny's laughing because I think he's got the security camera in front of you there?  Well, unfortunately, you guys remember Building Douche?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he kicked me out of the lobby, so I had to go up to the fifth floor.  So, I'm just listening to Craig scream.  I could hear him in the elevator.  What an ass.  Which one?  Why did he kick you out of the lobby?  Why did he kick you out?  Yeah.  Well, I'm still not allowed to be on a cell phone in the lobby. 
[00:58:00]  Daddy!  There is a douche working the desk.  Who doesn't know good radio.  In the Steinway building.  I like this.  Don't be on the cell phone.  I would say getting that camera footage is more important.  Yeah.  We did get it, though.  We did get it before he told us to.  Boy, you know, he's worried about a cell phone in the lobby of his building, but someone  is stuck in the elevator of the building that he's a manager for.  Exactly.  And he's been stuck for an hour and 15 minutes at this point.  That's what he's worried about. 
[00:58:30]  And, Danny, you're on the fifth floor, right?  Yeah, I'm in the hallway right now.  And you're, well, you've got to estimate for us.  Where do you think Craig is trapped?  What floor?  He is definitely on the fourth floor.  He might even be right below the fifth floor, like in between the fourth and fifth floor,  because when he was screaming, it was very loud.  So I could hear it quite clearly.  Well, Danny, bang on the elevator and go, Craig, Craig, can you hear me?  Let's see what this does.  Okay, hang on.  Craig, can you hear me? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah!  Yeah, he's definitely in between the two fourths.  He's in between the fourth and the fifth?  Yeah.  This just coming in, the building now is enforcing a media blackout.  A media blackout being enforced by the building.  We don't have a name, only douche.  We're calling him Building Douche.  Building Douche?  You heard it here first.  His name is Building Douche.  Is it the guy with the glasses, Danny, or the other one? 
[00:59:30]  No, it's not the door guy.  The door guy's cool.  It's the building manager with the glasses.  Is that the guy with the little creepy mustache?  Yes, exactly.  I hope that guy, I hope a fire breaks out just on his body somewhere.  He's awful.  Why would he care?  Fix your elevator.  Yes.  Hey, people are starting to say, could this be a terrorist thing?  This has not been ruled out.  Danny, you're on the scene.  What do you think?  Well, it is definitely possible. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, if someone was trying to sabotage the show by not allowing the rejoiner disc to  head over to CBS, it's quite possible.  You know, they have to start somewhere.  Oh, it's just in.  Yeah, we got you.  Hold on, man.  Okay.  Craig, how are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Now I'm playing with my broken rubber band.  Oh, you're back to playing with your broken rubber band.  Now you got your shoes and your socks off, right?  Yeah, my shoes and my socks are off.  Yeah.  And my shirts are off.  An O.N.A.  An O.N.A. exclusive report. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  You're here first.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to go to a caller, Jake.  Jake, who has an interesting question for us here in the newsroom.  Jake, how are you?  Do you have a feeling this might be caused by global warming?  Global warming.  Could this have caused this elevator disaster in the making?  An O.N.A. exclusive report. 
[01:01:00]  Craig, the intern's life hanging literally by a thread.  That elevator cable.  Danny on scene.  Media blackout taking place by Building Douche.  This story developing.  We will keep you posted.  That's right.  Danny, anything to add?  Well, we're still just waiting for the elevator company to arrive  so that we can videotape and report on the momentous rescue of Craig, the intern.  Hour and 20 minutes.  Will this video that we finally get be brought to you by Foundry Music? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  That absolutely will be.  Rumor has it angry Vince McMahon is on the scene yelling at Building Douche  to get Craig, the intern, out of the elevator.  You better get him out of there, lickety-split.  You hear me?  Or you're going to lose your job.  You want to lose your job?  Get that door open.  We need Craig, the intern.  Open that door.  Open that door now.  I said open it now. 
[01:02:00]  If you don't let Danny videotape the security camera,  you're going to have to deal with me.  And that's not going to be a happy prospect.  Hey, wait.  Danny, I've got to put you on hold.  I think Ed from Florida could talk Craig out of the elevator.  Is this possible?  Okay.  We have an expert.  Is this an expert?  Ed, are you an expert?  Many, many moons ago.  An O&A exclusive report.  We have an expert from Florida. 
[01:02:30]  Ed, what can he do?  Take a, if you look at the elevator door, there's a hole in it.  Take a wire coat hanger, bend it up, you know, into an L shape.  He doesn't have a wire coat hanger.  Ed, Ed, this just in.  He has a broken rubber band.  Yeah.  That's all he can use, MacGyver.  Yeah.  What can he do with a broken rubber band?  You can jerk off.  That's all you can do.  Hey.  Oh, now.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  If you can find a wire coat hanger, you can stick it in the door. 
[01:03:00]  Fine.  Well, it's not like, have you, Craig, have you searched the entire elevator?  Yes.  I have searched high and low and have not found anything.  Is there one buried in your head from when you were born?  Mostly.  Which one?  All right.  Hey, Danny, is there anyone there yet?  No, not to my knowledge.  No.  This is nobody.  The guy's been stuck for an hour and 20 minutes.  He's got to be hot, though.  Those jeans have got to be very hot, man.  You got to keep yourself cool. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, Craig, what are you down to right now?  I'm just down to my shorts and boxers and my hat.  Oh, he's in his boxers.  Exclusive report.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We got Wayne from Tulsa.  Wayne, what's up?  I was wondering, shouldn't Larry King be doing a live interview with this poor chap right  now?  Craig, we have Craig live from the elevator.  Craig, how important is that door opening to you getting out? 
[01:04:00]  Craig, Craig, how important is the cable holding that elevator up?  You're dangling five stories above the street.  Craig, are you able to go anywhere while you're stuck in the elevator?  How big is the elevator?  It's not that big at all, actually.  Well, give me a measurement in feet. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know metric.  If you said meters, it would be by me.  It's about four by five, maybe.  Four by five.  Is it five front and back or four front and back?  And five the other way?  How tall is it?  It's five front and back and four on the side.  Why not ask the colored elevator operator to take you up a floor to lingerie or sporting  goods?  Larry, that's the old days. 
[01:05:00]  Oh.  They don't have those people anymore.  Oh.  Yeah.  Craig, what are you doing right now?  I'm actually making sweat marks on the elevator door.  Is this helping to get you out?  No.  Do you have a skateboard?  Do you like the motley crew?  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Connecticut.  Chris, what's up?  We're in the middle of our press conference. 
[01:05:30]  We got Craig the intern stuck in an elevator for the last hour and a half.  What's up there, Chris?  O&A.  I've done a lot of stuck elevator research.  I believe violent video games.  Wow.  The cause of this stuck elevator, guys.  I just wanted to check in.  Thanks.  I'm out.  An O&A exclusive.  Chris from Connecticut bringing up a great point.  A lot of video games do utilize elevators, elevator shafts.  I believe violent video games could be the cause of Craig being stuck and potentially killed 
[01:06:00]  in this elevator tragedy we're living through right now.  We're going to go back to angry Vince McMahon.  He's got some survival stuff for Craig.  Like the intern there.  Yeah.  Craig.  Yeah.  Take your pants off.  I take them off now.  You heard me.  Take them off.  Take those pants off.  Craig, you got to take your pants off.  You got to get down to your underpants.  I'm going to go back to the show.  I'm going to go back to the show.  I'm going to go back to the show.  I'm going to go back to the show.  Your pants are off?  Yeah.  You take those pants off.  So now you've lost your, you started with what, a hoodie? 
[01:06:30]  I started with a sweatshirt, but I took that off straight from the beginning.  Okay.  The sweatshirt's off.  The t-shirt's off.  The shoes and socks are off.  And now the pants are off?  Yeah.  You were sitting in the middle of the elevator in your underpants playing with a broken rubber  band, right?  Yeah.  I still have my hat on, though.  Good.  Leave the hat on.  It'll protect you.  Can Danny get footage of this?  And Danny, if you have to get off the cell phone for a minute, is it possible to get footage  of that?  Yeah.  Crisis on floor four and a half.  Yeah.  Just have to come up with a name for it. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, but that's a porthole to, you know, something else.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Short floor?  Yeah.  You never want to go to the four and a half floor.  Will he get out?  I hear an impromptu memorial is being set up outside.  Flowers already.  Yeah.  Crosses.  Cups of coffee.  Things that interns do.  Nothing.  A wrong food odor that's painted white to commemorate.  Danny.  Yeah.  Anybody at the building yet?  Well, I think Renee's going to come here soon to take over filming duties. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  So, Craig, basically what Danny is saying, Danny's bored, S-less, and he wants to come  back here, and we're sending someone else to do the live reports and the filming.  Okay, that's fine.  Just the film, and I'll still be here.  Danny, on your way out, could you maybe get the footage of the security camera?  Because Craig is now just in his underpants.  Yeah, well, as long as building douche isn't...  Get building douche also.  Yeah, tape building douche as well. 
[01:08:00]  That ass.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I will do.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Wow, we do?  Okay, but we're sticking with this story.  We're definitely sticking with this story.  Crisis at the Steinway building.  Before we take a break, though, Jay in Detroit, this is a very, very important question.  Yes, Jay?  Hey, I was really worried.  I was wondering if you thought that this could happen in my city, and another...  Wow.  Well, let's go to our expert.  Can this happen in another city, Anthony? 
[01:08:30]  Indeed.  This can happen in another city.  Another question there, Jay?  I sure do.  Is there anything that the government could do, and is this the Democrats' fault?  Wow, well, the Democrats are blaming the Republicans, and vice versa.  The Republicans blaming the Democrats on this.  Money, not enough money has gone to the elevators in the major cities. 
[01:09:00]  And a life literally hangs in the balance as we speak.  I'm giving it up when I'm going down, and I'll be over here.  It's a call.  I'm going to work.  Okay, Anthony.  My God.  Wow, this must be important.  There's a lot of sound effects.  This has to be so important.  A lot of graphics and a lot of pew-pews going on, so this has got to be intense at this point.  Thank you, Jay.  Yes, it can happen in your city.  Yes, be careful. 
[01:09:30]  Be careful out there.  This just in, Michael Moore wants to do a documentary on Craig the Intern stuck in an elevator.  He's got a film crew on the way.  Let's say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just got word, breaking out of Jersey, that Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband is claiming to be Craig's father.  Wow.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  That's huge news.  I heard some yelling in the middle of that.  Craig?  Craig.  Craig, are you alive? 
[01:10:00]  Craig.  God, I hope not.  I'm alive.  I'm alive.  Damn it.  The elevator guy's here.  Oh, the elevator guy is here.  This just in, the elevator guy has reached the Steinway building, but don't...  Now, Craig can still die.  Right.  He can still die, so don't tune away.  Craig, how long is it going to take?  I don't know.  Well, yell and ask.  How long are you going to take?  You told me to calm down, dude. 
[01:10:30]  He's telling him to remain calm after an hour and a half stuck in an elevator.  This is beyond me.  I hate to editorialize, but screw him.  Hey, Craig, can you do me a favor?  What's up?  Just yell, can you take your time?  Opie and Anthony have to take a break.  Can you take your time?  Opie and Anthony have to take a break.  You didn't say anything.  We'll see.  Hopefully, we'll hear the conclusion of Craig stuck in an elevator. 
[01:11:00]  We hope so.  We hope so.  After the break.  Craig, commercials are much more important than you, so we'll get back to you in a little bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I want to thank all the ladies on Pal Talk.  They're wowing like crazy this morning.  Like crazy.  Make sure you get a sticker on your car.  Homemade sign on your car. 
[01:11:30]  Write it in the dirt on your car.  Because WOW stands for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  And there are plenty of ladies out there that will flash you on the way to work if they see that WOW sticker.  All right?  You'll see for yourself if you go into the comedy show this Saturday at PNC.  Lots of WOWing will be happening on the way to the event, in the parking lot, inside the venue.  But they're going to have to be a little sneaky about that one.  But you'll see.  What were we talking about before the break?  Oh, the Van Halen thing. 
[01:12:00]  Angry Van Halen people.  Hilarious.  If you want to have some fun, go to RothArmy.com.  I guess a bunch of people are really, really pissed off about a report that came out yesterday  that Van Halen's tour has been canceled before it begun.  And RothArmy.com, a website, very, very, very unhappy with us.  Very angry.  Very angry.  You want to read a few of these? 
[01:12:30]  Start with Bonzo.  Bonzo seemed to make a few posts.  Bonzo, probably a big, big David Lee Roth Van Halen fan, man.  He writes, tour off already?  Someone kill this quickly, or I'm going to effing snap.  I was just told by a co-worker that on their way into work this morning,  they heard on Open Anthony that the tour is off and there will be a press conference later today.  Something having to do with Eddie.  Of course I have to think this is BS, because O and A are a couple of immature C's. 
[01:13:00]  C's?  But has anyone else heard this S?  I'm not here to start any rumors.  I'm just seeing if anyone else heard this S.  Stupid Bonzo.  Uh, Dave Girl.  My husband IM'd me first thing this morning.  He heard the same ugly rumor.  It is a rumor, right?  Open Anthony said Ed had to go back to rehab and there would be a press conference this afternoon.  This is a sick joke, right? 
[01:13:30]  Some kind of sick joke.  And then, uh, people saying, uh, again, this Bonzo guy.  Oh, enough Bonzo.  You douche.  Has to be BS.  He went on E! Online, Blabbermouth, Rolling Stone, Google.  This guy was going crazy.  Just going nuts.  Trying to find out the info.  Is their door on or off?  Bah!  Uh, and this guy, Bonzo again.  Went to the O and A side.  This guy was just on the internet all day. 
[01:14:00]  Just panicking.  Went to the O and A site.  Now I have, uh, to go take an effin' shower.  Oh, because you were on the site?  I get it.  Yeah.  Look at some of the posts.  Bunch of a-holes.  I believe it's all-out war, friends.  Yeah.  Oh, oh really?  You don't want to take on our people.  Is it?  I mean, I know you guys are the Roth Army.  Look out for the Roth Army.  Yeah, where were they?  Uh, I can't say that.  Can't say that.  What I was going to say is something we're not allowed to center it in. 
[01:14:30]  But it was good, right?  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah, it was good.  It was mean, it was accurate.  Roth Army.  Well, uh, Diamond Girl.  Roth Army Militia.  If you ain't a Roth fan, you ain't S.  Yeah.  Hager fans are stupid.  Throw rocks at them.  That's what this lady posts.  Oh.  Does it go on and on here?  What else?  I like the threat.  Yeah.  The, um, and this is posted by Bonzo again.  I swear if I see them, us, I'll punch both their effing eyes out. 
[01:15:00]  I never did like them, and if they started this rumor, then I think the Army should lead  a revolt and get them fired, cancel, effed, killed, something.  What?  Or something.  Hell, even if it's true, I'd like to see O&A get effed up.  Really?  Would you bonzo 1026 on the David Lee Roth Van Halen Rotharmy.com?  You faggot! 
[01:15:30]  Let's make it official.  Roth Army versus the O&A Pest Kill!  In a cage match!  First they get, here it is.  This is a good one.  First they get Diamond Dave kicked off the radio.  Now this?  You know what the Iron Sheik would say?  Opie and Anthony, you got nothing but a couple of lying fag, uh, son of a bitch, and you  will get in the camel clutch, break your back, and F your A. 
[01:16:00]  No, he would say, Opie and Anthony would love us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, F Herpy and A Remy.  In there.  In there, uh, yeah, they're A with a nuclear warhead.  Goddamn liars are still blaming Dave because their CBS show got canceled sooner than his  did.  Really?  Hey, wait a minute.  Hello?  Oh, are we still on the air? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, we're on the air.  Dummy!  Who is that, Ford?  Yeah, well.  Roth, a favorite Rothism for this jerk right here is, I have hope and faith, and that's  more than just a couple of names of strippers in Albuquerque.  I went...  Shut up.  Here's Diamond Girl again.  Hack.  I went to Google and found this.  God, our pests are great.  It looks like Dave Lee Roth's first tour with Van Halen in 23 years won't happen after all.  Over the weekend, employees of tour promoters Lyme Nation were informed that the Van Halen 
[01:17:00]  tour has been shut down.  It's not yet clear what went wrong.  Just last week, the band released their first official photo of their new lineup to Rolling  Stone.  At the time, Roth told us that he was thrilled about the tour and that the reunion could be permanent.  I have hope and faith, and that's more than just the name of a couple of strippers from  Albuquerque.  He said, check back here for more VH News as the story unfolds.  Oh, man, dude.  ONA Pest, have fun.  It's RothArmy.com.  Free wheelin', man. 
[01:17:30]  He writes, if you guys want to really F with those little faggy no-talent hacks, you should  spam the S out of their phone lines.  Hopefully get past the P call screening.  They do.  And blast these mother effers with abuse.  There's enough of us to really make life miserable for these fags.  Is there?  Okay.  I'm inviting anybody from RothArmy.com to call us and spam our phone lines.  Yeah, let's go.  Please go ahead. 
[01:18:00]  If anyone else thinks it's a good idea, I welcome your criticism.  Also, we should get the phone numbers and set a day.  Oh, we can't wait.  They're going to set a day where they call us the RothArmy.  The RothArmy.  Just stop it.  You're embarrassing.  Bunchy bop.  Titty bop.  Yeah.  Bunch of guys with tails crawling up.  Those little tails from the 80s.  They all have like the leg warmers on.  Yeah.  What are you?  What are you?  They're holding microphones with like all the headbands tied. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  No one cares.  I can only imagine what a room full of these jerks have got to be like.  Hey, you're Bonzo 1026?  Wow, cool.  I'm Dave's girl.  No, I'm a guy, but I call myself Dave's girl.  Yeah, we ought to punch them right in the eye.  Can we get more posts from, what is it again?  RothArmy.com?  Yes, because I'm sure by now some of our guys have gotten in there and I can only wonder. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, well, you know, it is point-counterpoint, isn't it?  It certainly is.  It's RothArmy.com versus the O&A Pest.  Point-counterpoint on the OPA Anthony Show.  Oh.  All right, so we'll get the other side of this because I'm sure the pests are having fun with RothArmy.com.  Kill them.  For the people that are in the know, it looks like the new bit's working, huh?  Hey.  That's all I'm going to say. 
[01:19:30]  That's it.  That's all we say today.  People angry.  For the people that are in the know.  People get so angry.  Boozy boozy bop.  Titty bop.  There he is.  There's your hero.  What is that?  From what song is that from?  Microphone hawk, I can't hear you.  Hold on, what?  Oh, they say RothArmy.com is getting slower and slower as they're trying to post.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, they're challenging us.  Yeah.  They're going to spam our phone lines.  You want to bring it on, RothArmy.com? 
[01:20:00]  Do you really want to bring it on?  Well, you bring it.  You just bring it and see what happens.  You're insane, man.  It's Angry Vince, everybody.  And I'm angry at Roth.com.  RothArmy.com.  RothArmy.com.  I don't care what they're called.  Let them bring it.  Take your shirt off.  Take it off now.  Word coming in that it's crashed.  RothArmy.com is down. 
[01:20:30]  We crashed their stupid site.  Well, how much of a fight was it?  Now take your pants off.  Go ahead.  Take them off.  Take them off now.  Take off your pants.  Angry Vince.  Angry Vince rules.  My toaster has more bandwidth than RothArmy.com.  It's dead.  Take your bras and take it off now.  Wow. 
[01:21:00]  That didn't take long.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  I just want to bring everyone up to speed.  That's what Anthony's...  That's it.  That's what Anthony...  Crawl around like a dog.  That's what Anthony has been imitating the last few days, man.  I can't get enough of it.  All right.  So the fight's over before it really began, huh?  Yeah.  Apparently, the site's down.  I would have liked to have seen a few...  Posts?  Yeah.  Posts. 
[01:21:30]  But it seems like they got the same five Van Halen fans over there just kind of tossing  things around.  I want to see other posts, too, from them like before this.  Like what did they talk about before they had this to talk about?  Dude, Dave sucks.  Sammy rules.  Dude, just don't even bother with that.  Come on.  Everyone knows Roth is better.  And they're saying we need ratings and that we're doing this because what?  We're jealous of David Lee Roth and the radio show he did for CBS or something like that? 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  We had him kicked off the air, didn't we?  Yes, there, Tham.  Just the one other thread I saw before the site crashed was, did any Van Hagar dates sell  out?  Oh, so they wanted to get their little fight going.  Yeah.  Saying, look, Van Hagar didn't do well.  Who's this?  What's your name?  My name is Michaela.  Michaela from Philly listening on YSP.  What's up?  Yeah, it looks like the Roth army crash, just like David Lee Roth's radio career. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  Listen, I got a quick question for you.  Are you a tranny?  Uh, yeah.  Are you really?  Yes.  Good call, Hope.  You can just tell, right, Jimmy?  Where the hell are you in my backseat when I need you?  Hey, listen, Jimmy Jordan, I heard a lot about you from the guy down on Wild with the Comedy  Casbah.  I heard you were just a mess when you were younger.  Oh, Mark, yeah.  He's a buddy of mine.  Yeah, Mark Vito, he says hello.  Oh, thank you.  What's up, baby? 
[01:23:00]  Hey, are you passable or are you just a mess?  According to Chris and Thomas, I'm not, but I'm working on it.  So you work for Kid Chris?  I don't, but I'm usually on their show.  I'm the tranny that everybody beats up on the Kid Chris show.  Wow.  I got a quick question.  You guys are coming to Philly and Eddie McGonigal backed out because he's a lame ass?  Yes.  He really is lame ass.  For the people that don't know, Eddie won car crash comedy down there in Philly, and  we think the guy's hilarious, and we think he would do great when the virus tour hits Camden 
[01:23:30]  September 15th.  He backed out because he's a chicken ass.  Yes, he is.  Well, I'm going to try out for his spot and clean his spot.  Yeah, and I'm supposed to call Kid Chris's show to talk about this a little bit, but here's  the deal.  We're going to come back to Philly and do it all over again from a live venue, an all-out  car crash comedy thing the day before, I guess, the virus tour, so September 14th, I believe.  So we're calling all comedians from all over.  I don't care.  I don't care if you're from the Philly area. 
[01:24:00]  As long as you can get down to Philly.  Wait, do we have somebody, hold on, hold on, do we have somebody to do car crash for  Jersey?  Because PNC is this Saturday.  Yeah, I guess we're trying to do it on Friday.  Oh, we are?  Okay, we have guys, we have, all right.  Yeah, we're trying to do it on Friday.  We're calling all comedians in the New York area to come in on Friday and do your thing,  and basically you do your act, and as soon as we don't like something in your act, Anthony  pushes the car crash, and you get three car crashes, and if you make it to the end of  the set without three car crashes, then you'll be voted on, and we'll decide who's the best 
[01:24:30]  for the opening slot.  And we're not throwing you to the wolves, stupid Ed McGonagall.  Seton Smith went on, and it was very funny.  Voss goes up, he warms up the crowd, you're not walking into a death set situation, you're  walking onto a warmed up crowd, they're not rowdy yet, they're just getting settled in,  and you can do really well in that spot.  Yeah, we all know Seton Smith's name.  He was just a nobody, I mean, in our world, he comes on our show while we're in Washington,  he wins Car Crash Comedy, and then the next day he's in front of about 6,000, 7,000 because 
[01:25:00]  people are still coming in, and he killed, and now we all know who Seton Smith is.  He's great.  Just like that.  No, he's ungrateful, that's what his problem is.  He's very ungrateful.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we want him to call the show, but he's making excuses about that, where he has a job,  and he can only do it from 6 to 6.15, or something like that.  What?  He's a crybaby.  I'll go out there and bash my junk with an empty water bottle and get tons of laughs  more than he will.  Do you do that?  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You're a good egg.  Yeah.  So what do you do with your, what do you do as a tranny, by the way?  I'm in the middle of my transition right now, and I spend my times and my days calling the  Kid Chris show nine times a day.  Wait, so you're on hormones, right?  Yes, I am.  I'm on an injection.  Are you going to get the, are you still functional or no?  No, I think it's like a Bic lighter right now.  Oh, no.  So you're going to actually have the whole transformant, your penis into a vagina surgery?  My boys are gone.  I have an empty ball sack. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, wow.  Holy cow.  Wait, they took-  Is this making the radio?  I don't even know.  I don't think that is.  Well, I don't think it is either, man.  They took your-  Oh, this is getting dumped.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Basically-  They removed your testicles, and now you don't have them.  And I have boobs.  I have boobs.  I don't think they're allowing that either, right, Ann?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're allowing as far as that's concerned.  I hope they're allowing it, but you never know.  They should.  Part of it's missing at this point.  When do you actually get the surgery?  Probably from like another year from now. 
[01:26:30]  I just had face surgery last week.  Face surgery?  What are you getting done to your face?  I had another nasal reduction.  Nasal reduction.  Why?  You got a big nose?  I had a big snosh.  It's not big anymore.  All right.  I'm working on it.  Could you send pictures?  Actually, you got my MySpace page.  You can look at it right there.  All right.  What's the MySpace?  It's MySpace.com.  Yep.  Over at Slash.  Yep.  Crazy Michaela.  M-I-C-H-A-E-L-A.  Oh, boy. 
[01:27:00]  Iraq, you can't spell.  No.  Michael's page is coming up.  Did you get it?  It's like Michael with an A.  Michael with an A.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Soon it's going to be Michael with no C.  Did everybody spell the spelling bee over there, or what?  Well, it's kind of an odd spelling name.  See, here's the problem.  Here's the first problem I see as I look at your picture.  You got broad shoulders.  That's why they call me Big Back.  Oh, my God.  I'm only like 5'9".  Yeah, but you got the guy broad shoulder thing. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  You got the female bodybuilder look going.  Female bodybuilder, huh?  I mean, that's going to be tough to overcome, the big, broad shoulders, no?  Well, I'm losing mass really, really fast.  But you can't lose bone.  I mean, guys are just born with the broad shoulders.  They're bigger boned.  Have you ever seen some of the female bodybuilders?  They look like Buicks.  I love female bodybuilders.  Look at Nicole Bass.  What is she, like 6'2"?  She can take a big arm.  Man. 
[01:28:00]  Wow, you're a...  Oh, my God.  Well, I've seen worse.  I'm getting there.  Come on.  Give me a shot.  What do you want us to do?  Don't put me down too much.  I mean, you know.  Well, the nose is still a little big, okay?  The shoulders are definitely too broad.  Stop doing...  You want to ride on him?  You look more like David Lee Roth than David Lee Roth does now.  Give me that.  Stop doing curls.  You got to soften up your arms a little bit.  You got girl hands already.  So that's all right. 
[01:28:30]  Really?  Your hair is passable.  Okay.  But around your mouth, it just looks manly.  Working on it?  Come on.  I just started this about a year and a half ago.  And why did you decide to go down this road?  Because I got tired of trying to be like you guys.  I'm tired of it.  Wait.  Go to this one.  Oh, man.  You're on your way, I guess.  I mean, I think I look pretty goddamn good since like a year and a half into it.  Well, I know your kid Chris's property there, but you're going to have to come by and say 
[01:29:00]  hi to us when we're down there in Philly in what?  September.  September 15th.  I will definitely be there and say hello.  But I just wanted to tell you that Eddie's ungrateful and I want to come up and do Car  Crash and win my chance to get up there.  All right.  Very cool.  Everyone's checking out your MySpace.  There you go.  Tell kid Chris we said hey, all right?  I will.  And I had to tell Jimmy Norton hello for Mark Vito.  Give Mark my best.  He's been a good friend for a long time.  Tell him I said hello.  And Jimmy.  I'll be seeing him this weekend.  Okay.  Jimmy, would you back in the day? 
[01:29:30]  No, no.  I would know.  He said Jimmy used to run back and forth on the stage.  No, you know now, but I'm just saying like let's make believe.  Like back then I probably would have known what I'm saying.  I probably would have.  Oh, you would have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This would have been obvious to you.  I think so, yeah.  Okay.  That's all I'm saying.  Obviously, you know what it is now.  Oh, yeah, no, no.  Back then.  I'm talking like we didn't talk to you.  You just saw this picture.  You saw this walking up to your Saturn.  What are you thinking?  If I didn't know, but again, there was a time where I was very ignorant of certain things.  Like I didn't realize that they got implants.  I was so stupid.  So I would always just see if this person had breasts. 
[01:30:00]  If they had breasts, they were a woman.  I just never.  And then a New Brunswick cop told me, you idiot, they get implants.  A cop told you that?  Yeah, this guy Jimmy I know.  He's a cop in New Brunswick.  I was like, oh.  That's where you want it.  All right, we'll see.  Mine are real.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Hormones too.  They take all these weird shots, and they do develop real bosoms.  All right.  All right, thank you.  We'll see you in Philly.  All right, you guys take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Hyman.  He's part of the Roth Army.  Oh, no.  Rotharmy.com. 
[01:30:30]  Hyman Roth Army.  Hyman Roth Army.  Hyman Ross.  Hyman.  Yes.  Mike.  Hello?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, you're on the S, sir.  Anthony, we're bigger than U.S. Steel.  I don't think he's part of the Roth Army.  I found a post from the Roth Army site.  Okay.  Listen to the, what kind of mindset is this?  It is so totally laughable to see the Hagar drones crying the blues and playing pretend revisionist history. 
[01:31:00]  Every single show outside of the just added second night dates sold out pronto Saturday.  So these tards go looking for a single seat in the nosebleed sections and attempt to rag on showman par excellence David Lee Roth.  Pathetic little, still mad about that abomination in 2004.  I suppose you know the one where Ed was so glad to be touring with that beached whale who sings like utter crap now, referencing Sammy Hagar. 
[01:31:30]  Even if he once did hit pretty little Steve Perry-like notes, one thing you've got to give Hagar, he had range.  Oh, boy.  He had more range than David Lee Roth.  And David Lee Roth was trying so hard after Hagar got with Van Halen.  He was trying so hard to sing like Sammy Hagar, and he can't.  He doesn't have that kind of range.  And it was embarrassing.  You ever hear his attempt to do jump, but in a higher register? 
[01:32:00]  It is so painful to listen to.  Wait, is that when he did it recently?  I can't remember where it was.  It might have been on Howard's show.  I'm not sure.  But it was awful.  It was so bad.  Can we get a copy of that?  I'd love to.  Get a copy of David Lee Roth doing jump live, and he tries to hit like these high notes because Hagar could do it.  Yeah, and he's bashing Sammy Hagar.  They can't stand to see Ed all cleaned up now and all smiles besides Brother Dave and selling out big arenas in minutes flat. 
[01:32:30]  Ed, Alex, and Dave are laughing all the way to the bank at you stupid Hagar Klingons.  Is Wolfgang laughing?  Wolfgang is laughing.  Read him and weep.  Well, there you go.  That's a big Roth fan.  Rotharmy.com versus the ONA Pests.  I got nothing against David Lee Roth and the band doing this.  I like him.  Fine, whatever.  But it's these fans that are like kind of stuck in 1980. 
[01:33:00]  You shouldn't be making a big deal like this over David Lee Roth and Van Halen.  Go enjoy the show, the nostalgia of it all.  Found a live track of Jump.  Don't know if it'll be what you want.  Let's give it a try.  See if it is.  It doesn't sound bad on this one. 
[01:33:30]  It's not good.  This might be older.  Yeah, he's hitting the nose.  Who could you watch me older?  It's probably karaoke for someone else.  It really, yeah.  That actually sounded good.  Yeah, it sounded really good.  You got to be fair.  It was probably 1980, yeah.  We got to take a break.  We got to.  The synthesizers in Jump, they're too much.  When we come back, we're going to talk about Michael Vick a little bit more.  Yes.  Deion Sanders. 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  Just a dumb athlete.  Wow.  Great player.  Dumb athlete.  Stop writing articles.  You're a dope.  Wait till you hear what Deion Sanders has to say about Michael Vick.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony?  Got to go right to Eric from the Bronx.  Black guy.  Eric.  Yeah, whatever it is.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, Eric?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, I want to let you know I've been listening to your show for the last couple of months, 
[01:34:30]  and this Michael Vick thing, man, if it's white, it's all right.  They're just coming down home because he's a black man.  That's not true.  Oh, wow, Eric.  Come on.  The animal rights activists, dude, they go after everybody.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Nah, man.  If it's all white, it's all right.  I agree with you.  That's the way it should be.  If it's all white, it's all right.  I mean, that's a good philosophy to have.  I don't agree with that, to tell you the truth, sir.  I don't believe if it's white, it's all right.  Listen, can I just say one thing to you, fellas? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Chocolate rain.  I got real cold screener, dude.  Watch out, boys.  All right.  Wow.  He sounded like a black guy that was interested in talking about the...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Tim's losing his mind down.  Speaking of Michael Vick.  Yeah.  Nice set up there.  Nice seg.  People are coming out of the woodwork to talk about the Michael Vick situation. 
[01:35:30]  You got Steve Harvey here in New York.  He mentioned something on his show yesterday.  He ended his show, I guess, according to the Daily News.  He closed his show yesterday by calling it a bad day because of his friend Michael Vick's  guilty plea in the dogfighting case.  He's calling him his friend, but I would bet a lot of money they've never met.  Really?  I don't think they met.  Michael Vick.  Might have.  Maybe.  They all hang out in the same circles. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I like Michael as a person.  I really do, said Harvey.  But what this shows is that the people who came with you can't always go with you.  Hmm.  What?  Like your posse?  Basically, like you're growing up, I don't know, in the hood or wherever you're from,  and you start to get famous.  With some bad influences.  And you've got to make some tough choices and realize that some of the people around  you could blow up your spot.  True.  Your dumb friends will wreck things. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  That's what Harvey's getting at with this comment.  When you reach a certain level by your talent and hard work, you don't have to stay with  people who will bring you back down.  So Steve Harvey...  He's blaming the people that are around Michael Vick to...  Pretty much dumped all of his old friends.  Yeah.  Is that what he's saying?  Yeah.  Dump your friends once you get famous.  That's what he's saying.  All right.  And then you've got Deion Sanders.  Where do we start with this?  I mean, you can pretty much read this whole thing.  We highlighted some good parts of this. 
[01:37:00]  He's just...  He's an ass.  Because where he's coming from is just...  It's stupid what he writes.  He just comes off as a dumb guy who's trying to explain something and be a good friend,  but he just comes off as a dope.  He starts off...  I want to read this first part, then we can read the highlighted parts.  I would have never thought Michael Vick, one of the NFL's most exciting players,  the man who makes the network execs smile every time he plays, would ever be indicted  for crime.  Crimes against man's best friend. 
[01:37:30]  That's Deion Sanders.  That's just a meaningless opening paragraph.  Yeah.  It's supposed to have some kind of an impact.  It's meaningless.  He could have just wrote, word, word, word, word, word, word, best friend.  The potential impact could be devastating.  He could lose millions worth of endorsements.  Nike has already suspended the release of his new shoe.  He could lose millions he was supposed to get from the Atlanta Falcons if the club decides  to cut him.  That's unlikely, but it could happen if he's convicted or makes a plea arrangement.  Or his reputation might wind up so stained that he's never forgiven in the court of public 
[01:38:00]  opinion.  That would be too bad for the 27-year-old superstar.  This is all the result of perspective.  Perspective.  And this is what Deion Sanders has to say.  What a dog means to Vic might be a lot different than what he means to you or I.  Hold on.  Don't start shaking your head just yet.  Listen to me.  He's right.  I was shaking my head.  This guy's good.  Yeah.  Some people kiss their dogs on the mouth.  Some people let their dogs eat from their plates.  Some people dress their dogs in suits more expensive than mine.  Some people have a lot of peanut butter around the house. 
[01:38:30]  More expensive than his suits?  There was a doggy that was being walked out of my building yesterday.  It had little doggy booties on it.  Booties.  Because it was raining.  They do that in the winter, too.  The salt makes their little paws hurt.  By the way, yes, we did play Hagar's version of Jump.  Yes.  Yeah, we realized that's why it sounded so good.  And he was able to hit the notes because it was Sammy Hagar.  I'd love to find that version of David Lee Roth doing Jump because it's just awful. 
[01:39:00]  So you can stop calling on that.  And some people enjoy proving they have the biggest, toughest dog on the street.  You're probably not going to believe this, but I bet Vic loves the dogs that were the biggest and the baddest.  Maybe he identified with them in some way.  Yeah.  He didn't love them.  As soon as they lost, he killed them.  Let's talk about some people's perspective of the Jews a few years ago and other people's perspectives.  Is that okay?  Hey, just if you put it in a certain perspective, I love my accountant. 
[01:39:30]  I love my neighbors.  I love them.  Let's talk to somebody else, perhaps in the mid to late 30s.  And your perspective is irrelevant because the bottom line is there's a law against murdering dogs by drowning them or electrocuting them.  So for however poetic he's attempting to be here, it's just drivel.  Right.  Michael Vick's perspective on dogs is irrelevant to this act of the committed crime.  It's like saying there's a perspective on bank robbery.  Yeah.  I view it as community property. 
[01:40:00]  Some people see it as making a few extra bucks.  And then dumb Deion Sanders.  What he talks about is how much money he's going to lose in endorsements.  Yeah, I know.  That's the most important thing.  Good point, stupid.  He goes on.  Why are we indicting him?  Was he the ringleader?  Is he the big fish?  Or is there someone else?  The top cheese?  The big dog?  Yeah, the big cojota?  The head muckety-muck?  What an ass.  The fights allegedly occurred at a property that he purchased for a family member.  They apparently found carcasses on the property. 
[01:40:30]  Not apparently.  They did find carcasses.  Yeah, it's not how they did.  They did.  I mean, it's documented.  They've been digging up graves ever since this story broke.  Yeah.  Not graves, whatever.  But I must ask you again, is he the ringleader?  This situation reminds me of a scene in the movie New Jack City when drug dealer Nino Brown  is on the witness stand and eloquently says, this thing is bigger than me.  I'm glad that it reminds him of a movie from like 15 years ago.  He's really got his finger on the pulse.  It reminds me of a time I ran past Reggie White. 
[01:41:00]  You shut your face.  God almighty.  And I like the fact he says, was he the ringleader?  Like, what a silly question.  He bought the property.  Yeah.  He's a superstar.  No, he was a puppet for some guy named Ted.  Jackass, of course he was.  And even if he wasn't, too bad.  He bought the property.  He's the big name.  It was Charlie.  Charlie did it after he killed Nicole.  Then he goes on.  He goes, are we using Vic to get to the ringleader?  Are we using him to bring an end to dogfighting in the United States? 
[01:41:30]  The only thing I can gather from this situation is that we're using Vic.  Was he wrong?  Absolutely.  Was he stupid?  Can't argue with that.  Was he immature?  No doubt.  But is he the ringleader?  I just can't see it.  Of course you can't.  I believe Vic had a passion.  I don't like the terms he's using, by the way.  The soft terms.  Wrong.  Stupid.  Immature.  How about was he a scumbag?  Or a criminal.  How about was he a sadist?  How about that?  This goes a little bit on being immature when you're murdering animals because they don't 
[01:42:00]  murder other animals efficiently enough.  We were talking the other day.  I'm trying to see the other side on things.  This thing is going on all over the place.  There's a whole dogfighting underground thing going on.  Not in my neighborhood.  Not in your neighborhood.  It falls into a certain community.  I guess that's what he means about perspective.  He goes, some people treat their dogs nicely and let them lick their face, eat out of their  plates, dress them up in little clothes and stuff like that.  And other people are barbaric with their animals and treat them horribly, make them fight, 
[01:42:30]  kill them.  That's perspective?  Yeah.  And is that a perspective that you're seeing, that you see?  I don't see that perspective because I've never seen that live.  It's never been part of my lifestyle.  The people that I hang out with have never done it before.  Is it something you're familiar with, Dion?  Is it something that the community you're from is familiar with?  He mentions that.  Does he address that?  Yes, he certainly does.  I believe Vic has a passion for dogfighting, Dion Sanders. 
[01:43:00]  Really?  Does he?  A passion for dogfighting.  Or a passion for pedophilia.  Yeah, pedophiles.  People have a passion for a lot of things that they shouldn't be doing.  Yeah, you could have a passion for horrific things.  Drug use.  I know many athletes who share his passion.  So this is an underground thing.  A passion?  He's saying a passion.  He's calling it a passion.  Because he's a dummy.  You are a dummy.  You're a dummy.  You're a great player.  I like him as a commentator.  I like Dion Sanders.  You're too stupid to properly get across what you're trying to say. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  He's too biased, too.  You're just way too biased.  We just live in two different countries.  Because it continues.  The allure is the intensity and the challenge of a dogfighting to the death.  He's glamorizing it here.  Right.  He's into this.  He's basically telling us, look, this is going on.  And a lot of people really get into it to the point it's a passion for them.  It's like ultimate fighting, but the dog doesn't tap out when he knows he can't win.  Can we point out something?  Here's another reason it's not like ultimate fighting, you stupid ass. 
[01:44:00]  A, the dog doesn't get rich if he wins.  B, the dog doesn't volunteer for this duty as a rational thinking being he's just made to do it.  Yeah.  This is probably more accurate if you're going to compare fighting to the Christians being forced to fight like that or fighting with lions.  It's probably more accurate because it's forced as opposed to voluntary, you dummy.  Yeah, I'm sure he'd rather be scratched behind the ear, giving a little dog treat.  Yeah.  And you play fetch with him out in the yard. 
[01:44:30]  And maybe you have that pink lipstick tickled a bit.  Right.  And here we go.  It reminds me of when I wore a lot of jewelry back in the day because I always wanted to have the biggest chain or the biggest, baddest car.  It gives you status.  It gives you status if you have a dog that could win a lot of these dog fights.  We're in two different universes here.  That's what I'm saying.  This goes back to the whole I am his thing.  I just don't get the other side of a lot of these issues.  Yeah.  But it's like, I understand the status thing, but it's stupid. 
[01:45:00]  How about your own accomplishments?  Yeah.  How about that kind of getting you, making you feel good about yourself?  Your own accomplishments as an athlete.  And how about this?  In gangs, killing people gets your status.  A lot of times you murder somebody to be initiated.  It's looking like that's what happened in Newark.  Those guys that succeeded in executing those four kids, they would have gotten status.  A little status in the gang.  It means nothing.  It's a passion for being in the gang. 
[01:45:30]  A passion for being the baddest.  They have a passion.  He's a horrific writer.  He really is.  Because now look at this, how he tries to bring it around a little bit.  Can I pause for a moment to ask you a question?  No.  Who shot Darren Williams?  Incidentally, excuse me, you're writing.  You don't have to ask to pause.  Just write when you feel up for it.  Can I ask?  No.  Who shot Darren Williams?  Remember the Denver Bronco cornerback?  I'm sure more, I'm just more concerned about bringing to justice someone who killed a human.  I'm sure they're still investigating that case, you dummy.  They don't know who killed JonBenet either.  The prosecutors from Denver didn't drop everything and fly to Atlanta, you horse's ass. 
[01:46:00]  Just because the story's not in the press anymore doesn't mean they said, well, oh, well, we're never going to find the murderer.  They're still working on it.  And if they find him, they're not going to give him a little slap on the wrist and let him go.  Right.  Or finding out who broke into Miami heat forward Antoine Walker's home, tied him up, and robbed him at gunpoint.  Or how about, I'm sure they're still working on that case too.  How about who killed Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson?  Yeah, how about that?  Apparently it's never been properly solved.  We're the real killer.  Who's the real killer?  And then he goes on to say, we're attacking this dogfighting ring the same way a teenager attacks his MySpace page after school. 
[01:46:30]  This guy's got the worst sense of analogies.  They are the worst analogies I've ever heard.  Well, there's a little message after this.  How does that equate to attacking a MySpace page?  I don't know.  And then he jumps in.  Then he goes, by the way, parents, make sure you monitor your kids.  He's trying so hard to be this even-keeled thinker who has a message, yet he's taking the unpopular tact, but he's going to make you go, whoa, man, this guy really, I didn't see it that way. 
[01:47:00]  He's making me go, whoa, he's stupid.  Yeah, exactly.  But he's trying too hard because you're taking up.  It's like trying to justify on a much lesser scale why slaughtering Jews was okay.  There's no way to justify.  It's an unjustifiable act of pickiness.  And that's what he's trying to justify this as something that, what I'm getting is, look, white people, you don't understand our community and our passions. 
[01:47:30]  This is one of them.  Dog fighting.  All right.  That's what I'm getting out of it.  Sorry.  Oh, wait.  And here's the sentence that a lot of this was written.  He probably, here's what happened.  But he was in the shower and he thought of something because he's a dumb athlete, a dummy, who thought this would sound so deep.  Like, you know how we all have these moments where we think we have a deep thought?  And then we give it a few minutes and go, oh, my God, I would look like such a tool if I actually wrote that down or said it on the radio. 
[01:48:00]  But he writes it.  Well, the next sentence, this is the one he thought of in the shower that he thought would be really like, this whole article.  Oh, here it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, this sums up the whole article.  So we should have the same passion for man that we have for man's best friend.  He puts man in there twice.  Man's best friend.  Again, we know it's a dog.  So he wants people to fight to the death?  I guess.  That's the passion.  I guess.  I'm not getting that.  I guess it's a statement about humanity and how we're so focused on our own. 
[01:48:30]  Forget about the dogs.  What about the people?  The reason this is turning into a three-ring circus is that baseball is boring.  Basketball is months away.  Football is around the corner.  Didn't you say this yesterday?  And we in the media don't have a thing interesting to write about.  Really?  That's the reason.  When he starts seeing carcasses all over a really nice yard.  I like how he throws a we in the media.  Yeah.  Right.  Himself up there with Walter Cronkite.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Plus, he kind of picked a time where actually something interesting is happening in all of  those sports.  Right.  Like baseball has the bonds thing.  Yeah, that kind of peaked.  Yeah.  And then the NBA ref thing.  Yeah.  It's a pretty huge right now.  It's a huge story.  Great example.  We're not too bored when it comes to sports right now.  This is the time of year where we're right around the corner of having like four sports  happening at the same time.  Yeah.  All four sports will be playing at the same time for, what, about a month.  And what he's forgetting is this is an interesting case.  It is interesting.  Of course it is. 
[01:49:30]  A star guy with a pristine reputation who's doing something barbaric and there's bodies  in the yards and he was killing it.  That is interesting.  I'm sorry.  Of course it is.  It's interesting to read about.  And the last thing he writes about is, how will this end?  I have no idea.  All I know is the Falcons fans better pray because Vic's backup is Joey Harrington.  Enough said.  Like, okay, first he talks about the endorsements and then he talks about this.  He's equating the slaughter of these animals to this.  I love football, but it's drivel.  It's a bunch of guys throwing a ball. 
[01:50:00]  It's meaningless.  But he's right back to that.  That's the important thing.  That's the important thing.  Who's taking over for him?  Yeah.  Forget the fact that these dogs were killed.  The Falcons don't have a good back.  More importantly.  Yeah.  Another dumb jock who shouldn't be writing.  This is Stefan Marbury.  Had this to say about Michael Vick.  We don't say anything about people who shoot dids and shoot other animals.  You know what I mean?  And from what I hear, dogfighting is a sport.  It's tough that, you know, we build Michael Vick up and then we break him down. 
[01:50:30]  And I think he's one of the superb athletes and he's a good human being.  I just think that he felt in such a bad situation.  Two different worlds.  From what I hear, dogfighting is a sport.  Two different worlds we're coming from.  It's like, you know something?  I guess the Hispanic community has cockfighting.  That's what they do down in the Southwest.  There's a lot of cockfighting down there.  And they do this.  And we see it as crazy and barbaric. 
[01:51:00]  Yet we eat a lot of chicken.  You know, you put them in the factories and saw their heads off.  This was a well-kept secret.  That now is...  Yep, exactly.  Some light is being shown on what the hell's been going on for many, many years.  Like, there's a lot of people out there that don't really look at dogs the same way you  and I do.  And Stephon Marbury gives it away.  He said, because he's right, Michael Vick is a great athlete.  He was correct to say that.  But do you see the entitlement these jackasses think they have? 
[01:51:30]  They just feel...  Because they're a great athlete.  How is that relevant to anything in this story?  Who cares?  He is a great athlete.  We know.  We know.  So is the OJ.  Great athlete.  By the way, Al Dukes is chiming in.  He says that they did an update on the Darren to Williams case on Bob Costas, and they're  still working on it since New Year's Eve.  They didn't forget about it.  Dion.  It's just not in the papers as much right now.  God.  Just another entitled dumb jock who doesn't think they should be held to the same standards 
[01:52:00]  as the rest of the...  And there is this underlying race thing playing in this, too.  Of course there is.  There's this thing.  It's not as big as, you know, when you have a black on white or white on black crime like  that.  But there's this underlying race thing that's playing.  Like, the man is trying to keep him down for this dogfighting thing because he's black,  and this is something that's accepted in the black community? 
[01:52:30]  I'm not saying I'm asking.  But from what I'm seeing from these interviews I'm getting, this does seem to be something  that's accepted.  And they really believe in what they're saying.  Yeah.  You know, the Imus thing, bring it back to that, everyone ran away and hid.  I at least respect these guys for sticking up for their boy and saying, look, this is  what's going on.  Who knew?  But that's what I'm saying.  When the Imus thing happened, everyone ran and hid.  And he couldn't get a soundbite from nobody.  And he gave it away, too, because he said, hunting, well, it's okay to shoot bears. 
[01:53:00]  That's a white sport.  Right.  So what he's basically saying is it's okay for white guys to go out and shoot what they  want.  And it's not okay for black guys to engage in this sport.  But the difference is you're not allowed legally to get two bears and make them fight it out.  And when one doesn't fight well enough to drown him or electrocute him.  But I agree with you about hunting.  I think hunting sucks, too.  Unless you're eating it.  And these guys were eating the bugs?  Excuse me.  What?  Uncle Ted.  Oh, no, Uncle Ted.  I'm sure he's on Michael Vick's side. 
[01:53:30]  You know, I mean, I don't know about you.  I don't bark and I don't bite and I ain't no dog.  God bless Uncle Ted.  All right.  We're sure you have a point of view, Uncle Ted.  We get it.  People are great and animals suck.  Uncle Ted will tell you.  Uncle Ted will tell you.  You're not smart enough to know.  So let me tell you what's going on.  Thank God for an Uncle Ted to teach us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hillary Clinton off.  All right.  We know.  Funny word, Ted. 
[01:54:00]  Frustrating me right out, Uncle Ted.  We get it.  You're a rocker.  Who knew?  We got to get to the bottom of this.  We got to find.  We're going to investigate.  We got to find an expert.  I mean, I'm sure there's someone out there that knows a lot more about this dogfighting  than we do.  We have no clue.  Yeah.  I mean, these stories pop up every once in a while.  That's about it.  But obviously, this is widespread.  If you want to get dogfighting legalized, make a push for it. 
[01:54:30]  Go ahead.  See how that works out for you.  But in the meantime, hunting is legal.  You know, hunting and eating animals, that's legal.  Fishing.  Fishing.  Sure.  Fish fighting.  That'd be fun.  And it's also by the fishbowl.  Burning ants with a magnifying glass.  Legal?  Yeah, I think that's legal.  Oh, cool.  Insects don't hold.  They have no weight.  And there is inconsistency in the animals when we look at it.  Because again, fishing's legal.  Whaling is not legal.  Fishing.  Whaling is a mammal. 
[01:55:00]  A whale's a mammal.  A very slappable mammal.  I love whales, but I would love to slap one's face just to have the look of incredulousness.  Imagine that big eye looking at you and you just slap his face.  And he just groans at you like, what are you doing?  Spray paint its eye.  Shut up.  Get away from me.  Spray paint.  Just sitting there hoping you're going to jump in the water. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  You can eat tuna.  You can't eat dolphins.  One's allowed to kill.  One you're not.  Dolphins are mammals.  So what?  They're thinking animals like me and you.  Dolphins suck.  They're mammals.  Show-offs.  We don't like fish.  Fish are stupid.  Can we do our Ted Nugent ID going into break here?  Sure.  Hey, now the phone's lit though.  Alex.  All right.  Make sure Alex hangs in there.  Black guy from Jersey.  This has nothing to do with race.  Nothing to do with race. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know many white guys dogfighting.  Yeah.  Well, we'll talk to Alex then.  I haven't seen any of them coming forward going, hey, we do this.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The country version.  Yeah.  Right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3.  Hey, rock.  What's Rotharmy.com? 
[01:56:30]  Think of this.  And I know.  No.  Bring it on, Rotharmy.  Bring it on.  You got to roll with up my chest.  Get to watch real.  Can you get it back up?  Yeah.  Can't you see me standing here?  I got my back against a wrecking machine.  I ain't the worst that you've seen.  Can't you see what I mean?  Man!  Might as well jump! 
[01:57:00]  Might as well jump!  Go ahead and jump!  Yeah, please jump.  Might as well jump!  My favorite part is man!  Don't you see what I mean?  Man!  Because he can't hit the note, so he's like, man!  What?  We brought it up years ago.  David Lee Roth talks his way through songs nowadays. 
[01:57:30]  I like that version.  I actually, I actually, I do.  I like that.  Shut up, you don't.  I swear to God, I don't.  Stop it.  I liked it better when it was called Hacy Dixie.  Exactly.  Benny from Washington, D.C.  I tried calling, but it was busy.  I'm a former D.C. cop who used to have to watch dogfights in Southeast.  Cop, you idiot.  This is extremely common among corner drug dealers who are showing off.  Status, and to compete one crew against the other.  Why don't they get that in, like, Grand Theft Auto? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, wow.  They're going to get that feature in there.  That would rock.  They get some status from your dogfighting.  Be great.  Let's go.  I'm going to play Parcheesi on the corner.  Or perhaps a checkered match.  Yo, king me, mother.  I say they play dominoes.  Well, do play dominoes.  No, that's Hispanics.  Cubans like dominoes.  Or Latinos, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Alex, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I was going to say it doesn't have much to do with race, but now that I think about it, 
[01:58:30]  it does happen a lot in the inner cities.  But for, like, you know, regular, everyday, you know, black folks, we don't go for that.  No, we're not saying that.  There doesn't have to.  See, it doesn't have to be that every black guy is into dogfighting.  But it seems that all the dogfighters are black guys.  Or a majority.  Like, a majority.  Well, because someone else wrote in and said that this is a redneck thing.  Yes.  And that the blacks have jumped on board, or the black community, or some people in the 
[01:59:00]  black community in the last 10 or so years.  But this has been going on.  Like where Elvis stole rock and roll?  They kind of stole the dogfighting thing from?  Yeah, they decided it was time to steal something from the white man.  All right.  But I think, like you said before, it has more to do with athletes feeling entitled.  Like, Stephon Marbury and Deion Sanders, all they're doing is taking up for their boy,  you know?  And it's just really stupid.  And, you know, I think that's more about taking up for their friend or feeling entitled. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, like he's just kind of backing up his buddy there instead of getting on and bad-mouthing him.  And me thinking race, me thinking race, because most black people I know like their dogs.  Me thinking race was more about their defending him on a racial basis, like when they mentioned  hunting and things like that.  But, yeah, I think they're both just dumb athletes defending another dumb athlete.  Yeah, I agree.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  Moving on to other things.  We've got to get Danny in here.  He found a fine website.  I think they just did a little report on it on the news, too.  It's hilarious.  I don't have the name in front of me, or we would do it right this second.  But first, we can do a quick little story here as we kind of start mopping up this part  of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Mopping up.  Turns out pink is not the color of choice for South Carolina prisoners.  The problem is they don't have a choice.  Well, now some inmates are taking their case against the color to court.  Inmates are required to wear pink uniforms when they are caught in a sex act. 
[02:00:30]  But one inmate in Marlboro County is suing the prison system.  He says wearing pink opens him to ridicule and puts his life in danger.  Prison officials are standing behind their policy.  And in their words, pink is a good way to identify what they call perverts.  Prisoners are standing behind the guy in pink.  Yeah.  That's good.  Why is it good?  They should be in pink.  Why?  Because then you look at him and just know that he is a... 
[02:01:00]  A goer.  Yeah.  A goer.  You know that he is a criminal.  They say a sex act.  So there's got to be one guy left that's not in pink at this point.  Did they just have...  What happened?  I think they're doing tribute bands or something on...  On Jill TV?  On Jill TV.  And I think I saw Evolution.  Oh, really?  Isn't that the Journey band my brother used to be in?  He's not in that one anymore?  No.  Why?  Because he's full-time with the U2 thing. 
[02:01:30]  Oh.  But if Evolution is, it would be my buddy Hugo, who is the singer, and looks and sounds just  like Steve Perry.  Sounds better than the Journey singer that you're using now.  Exactly.  So I'd like to see that.  All right.  So pink, whatever.  What are you going to do?  Mm-hmm.  Pink.  No, that's good.  I think sex offenders should get the worst time ever in prison.  No, it's not sex offenders.  There are people in jail who are caught having sex in jail.  Yeah.  Like, you know, people in jail...  Why pink, though?  That doesn't make sense.  Because it's humiliating.  It's humiliating.  They're gay.  So they don't want...  Oh, to have a gay sex in prison? 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  It's not about sex offenders.  Yes.  Just leave them alone.  If they want to have sex in prison, just let them be.  That's their life.  I thought it was sex offenders.  No.  Okay.  Just any sex act in the prison, they make you wear pink.  I wasn't listening.  That's why I said there's got to be just one or two guys at this point that aren't in  pink.  What?  Because they said any sex act.  It's not even like...  Like if you're caught...  Poval activity.  If you're caught with yourself in the cell?  It says sex act. 
[02:02:30]  That's a sex act, right?  Wow.  All right.  What's this website?  Where's Danny?  Danny?  Well...  Danny!  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  MyFreeImplants.com.  MyFreeImplants.com.  MyFreeImplants.com.  What is this about, Danny?  Well, apparently Fox is just covering it on their morning show.  And it's a website where girls could sign up and register to have other guys who are perusing 
[02:03:00]  the site actually pay for their implants.  Oh.  It's for, you know, small chested, I guess, women who want to put implants and don't have  the money.  Oh, my God.  As a show, why don't we take care of one of these girls?  You want to?  As a show, which one you want to take care of?  Who do you want to...  What's a top earner?  One that has to be local so she can come in.  It says choose one of the categories below.  Wait, go back.  Choose...  Come on, Iraq.  Who's that right there?  Hold on, hold on.  Number one, the top earner.  Yeah, but I don't know what...  Oh, no wonder.  It says choose one of the categories below to view the top 20 girls for that category. 
[02:03:30]  These lists are updated once per hour.  Top earners.  What is a top earner on this?  The one who's earned the most...  Earned the most money from...  Yeah, from...  Click on her.  ...benefactors.  All right.  So this...  Well, where's the rest of her?  So this is the top girl.  This is the one that they want to give implants to the most, right?  Her name's Jessica?  Yes.  Why can't we see her body?  Because that's where the site makes their money if you want to see all of her photos.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, how about this?  You son of a bitch.  We get in contact with them. 
[02:04:00]  They give us a membership, and we go through, and I say we take the most awful one and take  care of her.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  We go to the...  Nice.  Who's the lowest earner?  Yeah, let's go to the bottom earner.  Number 20.  Oh, the low earner.  Let's go to the bottom earner.  I'm sure number 20's still going to be pretty decent.  I want a mess.  Oh, wow.  20 is all right, Laura.  Yeah, what the hell's going on?  Laura's all right.  Don't they have like 100?  Number 100?  Yeah, we need like...  What?  We'll ask the site.  Yeah, we got to get someone from the site.  Ah, just another way to view porn.  Who are we kidding?  I know.  It's smut. 
[02:04:30]  I like the idea of this, though.  It's a good idea, man.  Wait, go back.  Looks like Iraq from here.  Looks like Amy Winehouse.  What's her name?  Yeah, it looks like Amy Winehouse.  Canceled her North American tour.  Boy, people are going to be...  You're not famous enough, stupid.  You have one good album.  Mm-hmm.  Or two.  Rehab.  All right.  Well, we'll get someone from the website.  Yeah.  That first one is definitely cute in the face, but you can't tell what the rest of it looks  like?  That's bull. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Horse hockey.  What?  Oh, the Colonel Potter?  Yes, of course.  I didn't put much gusto into it.  You gave it more than it deserved.  You gave it the worst lines.  Now they've got a whole list of girls that have reached their goal, and they got their  implants because of this website.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But to see the implants, you've got to get a membership?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I mean, because the site has to make money, and then in order for the girls to  get their money, I mean, you could donate, like, up, you know, just flat out, a dollar  amount, or you could buy what they call message credits so that you could talk directly  to the girls. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, God.  This is a scam.  Yeah, of course.  This is some kind of, like, porn site scam.  MyFreeImplants.com, run by FoundryMusic.com.  Yeah, wait.  How come there's a Foundry watermark on all the girls' pictures?  Well, no, no, no, no.  I was just trying to drive traffic into the front of my trousers because the blood was  flowing there.  I figured the traffic may as well.  Here's what sucks about this website.  Every implant has to have the FoundryMusic.com watermark on it.  Watermark.  Glows in the dark.  Oh, you got great boobies, but you got FoundryMusic.com across your chest. 
[02:06:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I just thought that it would be.  Yes.  The flaming cog of Foundry.  I did that years ago, but it's from two days ago.  No, no, no.  But I meant the watermark was years ago.  Steve also likes to say that Sony Pictures actually stole the Foundry font for Spider-Man.  He's right.  They did.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll,  He'll find the answer if he scrolls.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Where the hell is he today? 
[02:06:30]  Where is Steve?  Pretending that he's not here.  He's not putting up with any guff.  Where is he?  Today.  He ain't coming in today.  Why?  Who knows?  He had enough time in the barrel yesterday.  Why don't we listen?  He can't come in.  To this.  I am the werewolf.  Hello.  Werewolf is London.  Werewolf is better.  Werewolf is fun.  Werewolf is cute.  Werewolf is gothic.  I turned myself into a werewolf. 
[02:07:00]  Fight two demons.  Werewolf is boys.  Naked.  I like to make werewolf movies.  I fight vampires.  Werewolves like to howl.  They meet in the jungle of sharks.  Every night I turn myself into a werewolf. 
[02:07:30]  And bite my tongue.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know where it's from.  I love playing it though, man.  I don't know these retards.  I don't know what they do.  We'll get this stuck in your head.  Oh, no.  That is.  They're all in wheelchairs.  I don't know what that first one is.  That is.  The first one is pretty much a head in a wheelchair.  It's a head with some little twisted turnips.  I like making werewolf movies. 
[02:08:00]  Making werewolf movies.  That's my favorite.  Do you?  Let me see your resume.  How many have you made?  We got more today, too?  What's this one?  Yeah, apparently there's a series of these.  Ooh.  And which one is this?  This is, I guess, this would probably be like the first one because they're all kind  of introducing themselves, but they're not really dwelling on themselves.  They're just kind of saying what their name is and then a line and they kind of go  around a few times.  Here we go.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Wait, what?  He likes fingernail polish on his hamburgers. 
[02:08:30]  That comes in.  Oh, boy.  My name is Dummy.  I like Epidemiah.  What?  Money.  What'd she say?  I didn't hear the second one.  Wow, this is really hard to understand.  Not well spoken for actors.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  I like fingernail polish. 
[02:09:00]  I'm like Amber.  Oh, my God.  My name is Debbie.  I like applesauce.  I got it.  Applesauce?  My name is Debbie.  My name is Debbie.  I like antiques.  Oh, Debbie.  I got that.  My name is E-Rock.  I like wrestling. 
[02:09:30]  My name is Scott Mickin and I like ice skating.  What a show-off.  Counselor.  My name is Travis and the movie star.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Wait, why did they go back there?  Didn't you say that already?  Why did they go back there?  Because they can't tell who they're putting a mic in front of.  For some reason, they go back to all these guys and some people have different answers 
[02:10:00]  and some people don't.  My name is Chewbacca and I love the Millennium Falcon. 
[02:10:30]  What is that?  That was Chewy.  My name is Scott Mickin and I like music.  It's not Chewbacca.  It's Chew lead paint chips.  Oh, my God.  My name is Scott Mickin and I like music.  My name is Travis and I like beer.  It's good for you.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, I love it.  Wow.  And that's why he likes the fingernail polish.  Of course.  Oh, I know.  Oh, damn.  Hey, we gotta get out of here, yeah.  That went too fast today.  We were having fun.  Whatever happened to Craig?  Yeah, what did happen to Craig?  Craig, you there?  Craig.  Craig.  Craig.  His phone's still on hold.  Craig.  He was on me.  Craig.  Craig.  Craig.  Craig. 
[02:11:30]  Hello?  Craig.  Craig.  I'm going to sell this.  Someone help me.  Someone help me.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yes, we will see you tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Have a fine.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:12:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's the Opie.  guitar solo 
[02:12:30]  guitar solo 
[02:13:00]  guitar solo 
[02:13:30]  I don't have that!  Oh, this thing, yeah.  Dude, this is not me, though.  I know who had that before. 
[02:14:00]  This is Hoo-Hoo's board.  Hoo-Hoo designed this.  Yeah, they built this  to fit his ego, obviously.  It's the giant Captain Kirk  console thing.  And then everyone else gets a little  shelf.  Just a little thing.  To put your little things on.  Yeah, he even had buttons on this thing.  I don't think we've ever talked about the board.  He has a button that you push  and it says, look, Fred.  What is that, a light?  You know how...  Man, look at me, Fred. 
[02:14:30]  You know how we all make hand signals  and we try to get each other's attention  so we can listen a little better?  Yeah.  I guess he had a button that he pushed  and it told Fred to look at him  because he needed something.  So there's a look, Fred button.  Does anything happen when this button is pushed?  Yes, C-Rock.  No, they deactivated it.  What it was for...  Here's a write-me-a-joke-Jackie button.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want anyone to know that.  What it was for...  He doesn't want people to know  some of his greatest lines of all time  were written by Jackie the Jokeman. 
[02:15:00]  That's just plain dirty pool right there.  Yeah.  What it was for is if Fred had a bed  or a sound effect or something,  he would hit something over here  so that would flash.  And if he needed to talk to Fred,  like, hey, do we have this bit,  he would hit that  and it would go through the talkback  so Fred would hear it in the headphones.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  You lost me.  He would hit...  Fred would hit the button  or he would hit the button?  It worked both ways.  Like, if Fred had something,  he would hit this button  so that it would flash.  What happened? 
[02:15:30]  What?  It's just...  Your explanation  is just the most rambling,  boring...  You just...  You can't convey an idea.  Iraq gets...  Here's the thing.  Iraq is what we call a sweet boy.  And then what Jimmy does  is just keep coaxing you  and you fall right into it.  No, honestly,  I would love to do that.  I was really confused by his answer.  Of course you were.  I really wanted to know  what do you mean 
[02:16:00]  he would talk into the talkback?  I like the idea  of pushing a button  and getting someone to look.  Here's my button.  That's what I do.  I throw it at Iraq.  Iraq, please,  and just succinctly tell me,  why would Fred hit that button?  To let Howard know  that he had something  he was going to play  so it would fit with  what they were doing.  And so he wouldn't step on it.  And why would Howard  push that button?  I bring nothing to the table.  That makes sense.  Why would he push the button?  Is this on?  I don't know.  You don't know?  What do you mean you don't know?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  Just tell us. 
[02:16:30]  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, you bring something.  Eric, shut up.  Why are you telling me to shut up?  What is wrong with you?  Me?  What's wrong with you?  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Yeah, you certainly are.  Come on, that's funny.  We rock.  Yeah, that is pretty funny.  Yeah, it's up to you.  No.  Ah!  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, this is what I do. 
[02:17:00]  Battle.  I'll battle with you.  Oh, yeah.  This was a good one.  Yeah, you're going to beat this one?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Wow.  That is a bad one.  I'm sorry, Iraq.  You know I'm your pal.  I was actually really...  Iraq.  Iraq.  Why would...  Could you look up, please?  Just say hi.  He doesn't cry anymore.  He just smiles. 
[02:17:30]  He used to cry in these situations.  Not anymore.  He grits his teeth and goes,  I'm going to kill him someday.  I'm going to kill him.  We've toughened him up.  How would he talk to him in his earpiece  without the audience?  That's why you lost me on that part only.  Oh, they do that all the time  on news and everything.  Yeah, you'd hit the button.  Howard could talk into his mic  and only Fred would hear it in his head.  Oh, okay, okay.  Okay, that's all.  Big arm.  Like, while something else was playing,  or while someone else was talking,  he could go,  hey, do we have this?  And he would hear it.  Well, it was more like,  in Howard's voice,  I can't do Howard. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, Fred,  I'm dying over here.  Could you have Jackie the Joke Man  write me another line?  I need something here.  Nothing?  Well, it's just a fact that you...  Hey, at 10 o'clock,  we get to talk to that douche  from Wired Magazine.  Why at 10 o'clock?  That's when he was available.  He's from Denver, too,  so he's probably...  A little sleepy.  Yeah, it's probably 7 in the morning.  A little sleepy.  I have a big interview at 11,  so I gotta be...  Do ya?  What do you got, Jimmy?  What do you got?  A buddy of mine does a radio show.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:18:30]  Mike Gallagher.  You're doing a Mike Gallagher show?  Yeah.  Oh.  Who's Mike Gallagher?  He's cool.  You're doing more radio at 11?  Yeah, briefly.  I forgot who Mike Gallagher is.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, he's a big conservative guy.  He's a political talk, right?  Okay.  I think so.  And you being a flaming liberal,  that ought to be...  Mike!  Now, here's a problem  I know a lot of other women  have had besides me,  men, too.  You try on a pair of jeans,  but can't see exactly  how they fit from behind. 
[02:19:00]  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Exactly.  That never happens to me.  No.  Don't care.  It's behind me.  Hey, Jimmy,  Mike Gallagher might be  a good radio talk show host,  but he looks a little strange.  He does.  I mean, come on.  Let's be honest with you.  He came to my show  in Dallas with his son.  He's a supporter  of this radio show.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  And then he can appreciate  us making fun of him  a little bit.  Yeah.  He looks a very patriotic sight there.  From behind.  Well, an Arizona store owner...  Who's getting it from behind?  Someone was from behind. 
[02:19:30]  From behind.  ...exactly how they fit  from behind.  Oh, okay.  Well, an Arizona store owner  has the answer,  which he calls...  Are you ready for this?  Yes.  ...the butt cam.  ...the butt cam.  That's funny stuff.  The butt cam.  Are you ready for this?  Yes.  ...the butt cam.  He hooked up a camera  and a flat screen  and the days of people  twisting and turning  are, well, shall we say, 
[02:20:00]  behind them.  So far, this is the only  store of its kind,  but the owner thinks  the idea will catch on.  No, it won't.  How about this?  You put a camera  on someone's cock  and you fucking see  your ass rapidly approaching  in order to get out  of the way.  Stupid butt cam.  I see that being put  on a hard disc somewhere,  the camera,  and it being sold  on websites  with a Foundry logo on it.  Because it's just a camera  hooked up to a TV monitor.  Right.  And that way...  I'm trying to drive traffic 
[02:20:30]  to somebody's buttocks.  Yes.  And that way,  instead of having to put  your ass into the mirror  and then you turn  your head over your shoulder,  you could look  at the TV monitor  and the camera's  facing your ass  and now you can look  straight up  and see how you look  from behind.  Or forget the technology  and just buy another mirror  and put them both  and look at them.  Right.  No, no, no, no.  There's a lot of people  that won't put something up  with the Opie and Anthony  name on it.  Well, who are they?  I just checked my email.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  I hope the traffic  gets driven  into a Prius 
[02:21:00]  on its way to Jersey.  Where's that bastard?  Why did this make the news?  Yeah, it's a camera.  This isn't like  the future is here.  A camera?  Have you ever had a problem  looking at your ass?  No.  I usually have the mirrors  set up perfectly.  Like, all right,  that's how my ass looks great.  I guess I'll buy them.  And you just give a  two-second look.  Right.  If you look too much  and you're a guy,  feig.  Ooh, I look good.  Yeah, that's a nice ass. 
[02:21:30]  Look at that ass.  Look at that ass!  That's some ass!  All right.  I don't mean to keep  prompting you,  but I just love it.  All right, here's  a little more news  for everybody.  Who cares about  the butt cam?  Well, it helped  Marty McFly  and Doc Brown  get back to the future.  Now the DeLorean  sports car  is making a comeback.  Take a look.  The car is currently  being resurrected  in a Texas warehouse.  It's known for  its most recognizable features  like the distinctive  gull-wing doors  and stainless steel exterior. 
[02:22:00]  One Entrepreneur  plans to begin  hand-making  two DeLoreans a month.  With heavy-duty shocks  from Michael J. Fox.  Well, you know.  He won't get a stick.  You know,  reverse second first,  reverse second first,  third, reverse second,  third.  Stall, go, stall, go,  back up, stall, go,  stall, go, back up.  Going through  transmissions like crazy.  I know his tranny  will drop in the  showroom floor.  Have to have a trunk  full of transmissions. 
[02:22:30]  Go reverse stuff.  Back up.  All right, we get it.  One Entrepreneur  plans to begin  hand-making  two DeLoreans a month  starting next year.  Now, that's an ambitious project.  Is it?  Are people interested  in buying  DeLoreans?  No.  Probably the classic ones,  but they've been coming up  in the news lately.  People get so nostalgic  every 20 years or so.  They get all freaked out  and have to go back  and start buying up  crap from  the 80s 
[02:23:00]  right now.  Whatever that 20-year  mark is,  people start going,  oh,  you could use a DeLorean.  They get nostalgic?  Yeah, they get all  nostalgic.  DeLorean driving down  the road always  cares.  I didn't like the look  of those.  No.  Ever.  Hey,  No Filter Paul from Jersey.  Have you guys seen the  cover of Jim's new  HBO special DVD?  What?  I got the Bob Saget one  in front of me.  Is yours out too,  Jimmy?  No,  they're not coming.  They come out like I heard  the week after the specials. 
[02:23:30]  He's saying it has you  sitting naked,  leaning out from behind  an umbrella that has  Monster Rain written on it?  Yeah.  That's how it's going to look?  Yeah.  Then there's copies of it  out there.  Well,  they must be printing them  or something.  How the hell do you,  where do they see that?  Probably works there.  It's No Filter Paul.  How does that creep get out?  Oh,  him.  Maybe he could call.  How does that little  head man find things  before I do?  He is an amazing creep  when it comes to finding  things and finding things  out.  Yeah.  And getting,  like,  secrets.  He is just the creepiest 
[02:24:00]  guy.  He's probably like James  Bond and we don't know  it.  He's Fat James Bond.  You know what the  problem is though?  That English accent of  his.  He was backstage in  Washington or Virginia  or whatever and he has a  small head to begin with  and then he,  like,  took the hair away from  the sides of his head.  Yeah.  When you grow your hair,  like,  into growing afro,  more of an afro type of  thing to make your head  look or seem bigger.  A big belly.  Well,  that doesn't look like  you with an umbrella.  That's not,  that's not,  that's another photo shoot 
[02:24:30]  I did.  That's not it.  That's not going to be it,  right?  That's not it?  None of those.  Oh,  Jimmy,  look at those bedroom eyes  of yours.  I know.  Jimmy always tries to look  sexy in his pictures.  Wait,  is that the fucking,  Oh no.  cover of the,  no,  it's not the cover.  That's not the cover?  No,  Bob Saget's is acting,  but that's not my cover.  Oh boy.  I'm looking at one on Whack Bag.  I mean,  there's a picture of me  standing there with,  like the same thing I had  in the New York Post.  It was a photo shoot of me  wearing a sweat jacket.  Yeah.  But that's not the one, 
[02:25:00]  is on my,  that's on the back cover  of the HBO DVD.  Oh,  okay.  I don't blame you people  out there for being bored.  It's about me and I'm bored  saying it.  All right,  well,  we'll get to the bottom of that.  Maybe,  no field to Paul,  we'll call the show.  We got Mike Gallagher  doing a little speed round here  talking about Jimmy Norton  and his book,  Happy Endings.  Oh really?  Danny just ran this in.  Let's have joke time  here on the Mike Gallagher show.  What's a good joke you've heard?  By the way,  speaking of jokes,  I'm going to interview  later this week  Jim Norton.  Anybody know who  Jim Norton is?  You might not  because he's a very 
[02:25:30]  raunchy comedian.  I happen to think  he's one of the funniest men  on the planet  and he has had  a best-selling,  a New York Times  best-selling book  called Happy Endings.  Now,  I want to warn you  and there won't be  anything raunchy  when we interview him  later this week.  Happy Endings though  is not about  a fairy tale.  Okay?  That's all I'm going to say.  Could be.  He is a raunchy,  dirty guy.  I'm sorry to admit  that I really  find his humor.  Wow,  he's apologizing. 
[02:26:00]  He reminds me  a little bit of Sam Kennison,  the late,  great Sam Kennison.  Wow.  Jim Norton  is going to be our guest  later this week  to talk about  his award-winning  book.  I mean his award-winning,  his best-selling book,  Happy Endings.  Wow.  I once saw,  I've read about  25 pages already  and I was laughing  so hard the other night  Denise was ready  to call  the paramedics.  The tears  streaming down my face.  I'm Mike Gallagher.  God bless America.  God bless America. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  Oh, thank you, Mike.  That was very nice.  He's bringing on Satan.  That was really...  Why do you exaggerate  a little bit?  I mean,  call him the paramedics.  Come on.  Why?  That happens frequently.  People have told me.  Yeah?  I've gotten bills sent to me.  And the crying?  Him and his son,  I think,  came to Dallas Improv.  I don't know if he's out of Dallas,  but they were there.  He was really nice.  He's a real conservative guy.  It's funny, his audience.  What's his son like?  I don't remember.  He was just,  he was nice.  I'm just trying to think  if maybe he's trying to  get in better with his son 
[02:27:00]  and his son's a big fan of yours,  so he's trying to like  do that angle.  No, he seemed to be like,  he's just one of those guys.  I would never think  anybody isn't a fan of yours, Jimmy.  No, no, no,  but I thought that too.  Like, you'd think like  a guy like that with it,  but I mean,  his son is way younger.  I'm an older man.  I'm probably closer to Mike's age  than I am to his son.  Older man?  I'm almost 40 years old, dude.  I know I look a lot younger,  know what you said.  How'd you get older than me?  It just happened.  I shot right past you.  Past you somewhere in your 30s.  That's pretty fucked up.  Yeah.  I've always been older than me.  How does 40 feel? 
[02:27:30]  I don't know yet.  You're getting there though, right?  I'll be there in July.  Yeah, I got a few years still.  I know you do.  Another moron reporter  who doesn't get the show.  To this Wired Magazine thing,  I guess.  Yeah.  This guy has a problem with us  for some reason.  Yeah, he's coming up  in about a half hour.  Why can't he call right now?  Yeah.  Right the fuck now.  Call now.  Call now.  Be dialing.  I want him to actually  give his point here. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I don't want a big pile on.  No.  A big three guys  with him talking  all at the same time.  Let's see what he has to say  and then we get to talk.  I'd love to hear  how he knows where  like, what did he call us?  Twits, I think.  Twits.  And doofuses.  Doofuses.  I haven't used doofus  since I was in third grade.  Well, the guy's a great writer  and that's why he uses terms like that.  Oh, he's just terrific.  Doofus.  Yeah.  Twits and doofus. 
[02:28:30]  It just proves  the guy doesn't know this program.  He's heard about it.  He's heard the perception.  We could be doofuses  on this program.  To me it proves  just the opposite.  Wait, let me think.  Oh, the last break, right?  Doofus.  I'm more goofus  and you're galliant.  Yeah?  Is that good?  Goofus and galliant.  All right.  We got Alex Trebek  doing some outtakes here.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We were supposed to get 
[02:29:00]  to this yesterday, too.  Some potty mouth.  We're playing all the stuff  we were supposed to get to yesterday,  but we went off  on a little foundrymusic.com thing yesterday.  Yeah.  Bill K. from Philly.  Yeah, Opie.  No pile on.  We'll see what he has to say.  No, no.  It's not that I don't like Jeopardy.  I'm just trying to drive traffic  to the Price is Right.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  We got Steve? 
[02:29:30]  No, no, no.  I want to hear Alex Trebek's outtakes,  but I was trying to drive traffic  to Crumb Crisp Coating.  Steve Knopper.  Yeah.  Ah, here he is.  From Wired Magazine?  Yeah, that's the one.  Well, we read your...  Well, we got Googled  because, you know,  when we're mentioning an article,  they Google alert us,  and we read your article  in Wired Magazine.  Right.  The other one.  And you were talking about  the People Meter?  The People Meter, right?  Right. 
[02:30:00]  Which is going to take over  for Arbitron.  Arbitron is a way  to see what radio stations...  how they rate,  but you have to fill out diaries,  and they made it easier  by going electronic,  and now, like,  potential listeners,  wear beepers.  Right.  Well, yeah.  I'd just like to know...  I'd like to know  what the...  Like, the first line  in your article.  Ever wonder why  those twits,  Opie and Anthony  get to be radio stars?  It says,  blame Arbitron,  or perhaps yourself. 
[02:30:30]  What...  What...  I don't get that  whole first line.  Why the twits,  and then why blame somebody?  I mean,  if we weren't  popular in getting ratings,  we wouldn't be  what you called  radio stars,  I'm a little uncomfortable  with that title myself,  but...  Yeah.  But why all of a sudden,  like, right off the bat,  it was knocking us?  Do you have a little problem  with us or something?  Well, you know,  I did investigative research  on this subject,  pretty exhaustive,  and, you know,  the data showed, 
[02:31:00]  without question,  that twits  was probably the right word.  What can I say?  And what does a twit  describe for those people  out there  that don't know  what a twit is?  Well, you know,  I think I probably,  in retrospect,  after getting some  of the email  from your listeners,  may have used  some other words.  I got some good ideas  that way, so...  What were other words  you could say them?  We're on XM.  Yeah.  You can say whatever you want.  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, okay.  Douchebag, asshole,  fuckface, you know.  Those are some good ones.  Okay.  You guys have some  pretty eloquent listeners.  Yeah, well,  our listeners are our listeners, 
[02:31:30]  but you say,  wonder why those twits,  Opie and Anthony,  get to be radio stars.  What's the problem  that you have with us?  You obviously have  some kind of problem.  What is it?  Prove your...  I mean, I think the burden  of proof is kind of on you,  so just, you know,  tell me why you're not.  No, no, no.  You wrote the article,  Why Are We Doofuses  and Twits?  Yeah, what do you know  about our show, Steve?  I just...  I just thought  that the word twit  was an appropriate word,  and, you know...  What do you know  about our show, Steve?  Steve, you're a writer.  To say twit, 
[02:32:00]  you're a writer,  you're able to express yourself.  So what do you know  about our show,  and why would you call us twit?  Yeah.  Give us an example  of twittiness.  You know,  I just like to stand  by the word.  I think I'll just stand  by what I wrote there.  I think that...  No, no, we're not saying  you couldn't stand by it.  No one is saying  that you're even wrong.  I don't even mind it.  We're saying...  I was just wondering.  Simply, what is it  that made you write that?  I mean, you're...  I've written two.  Apparently, you've written a book.  I heard you wrote a book.  Yeah, I wrote a book.  So you obviously...  Okay, so you're good  at conveying ideas. 
[02:32:30]  So you conveyed an idea,  and we're asking you now  to do it verbally,  and all you're saying  is I'm going to stand by it.  Yeah, I'm just going  to stand by it,  and I'll just let you guys  show me why you're not twits.  I mean, you have an opportunity  here on the line  to show me, you know,  what about you  is not twit-worthy.  So show me.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay, lost you.  Last thing he said. 
[02:33:00]  I didn't hear it.  Well, call him back.  Pull the tape.  Find out what he said.  We all know what happened.  Call him back.  Was the bottom line.  Wow.  See, as soon as you  challenge these writers,  you realize they have no clue  about the radio show. 
[02:33:30]  Nothing.  And they get to just write  whatever the fuck they want  based on pretty much nothing.  It's not even that.  Pretty much a reputation  that they might have heard  in the media.  What was great was  watching him try to be like,  have bravado,  like,  no, I'm just going to stand by it.  You have to prove yourself to me,  but when you ask the guy,  like, no, no, for real,  we're not attacking you.  Why?  He had nothing.  I think we were proving  that we weren't twits  by giving him a forum  to talk about  what he wanted to talk about.  Steve, what happened?  I'm back.  What's the problem, sweetie?  Why'd you hang up? 
[02:34:00]  I didn't hang up.  I got cut off.  I was talking  and I got cut off.  Oh, okay.  Now, I think we're proving  we're not twits  by actually giving you  a forum here  with a civil conversation  to talk about your article.  I really think that kind of  proves a point right there.  Sure, that's fine.  We can talk about it.  You want to talk about  the people meter?  Let's talk about that.  No, no, no.  We want to talk about  why you said what you said.  You said,  ever wonder why those twits  Opie and Anthony  get to be radio stars?  Blame Arbitron.  And then you say  at the end of that 
[02:34:30]  doofus shop jocks  stay on the air.  So we're doofuses to doofus.  And you end by saying  unfortunately that also means  Opie and Anthony  whose main outlet  is New York's K-Rock  may be with us  a little longer.  So you have a real problem  with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, unfortunately.  So what is the problem  with our show?  Why are you calling us twits?  It's a really simple question.  And why do you have  a problem with us?  I just decided that  I thought that you were twits  and I thought that  would be a good word.  And I'm just going to  stand by that.  I think that's what I'm going to do. 
[02:35:00]  Okay, but let's get beyond the twits.  This guy doesn't even know  our radio show.  Steve, you're looking really stupid  as a writer here.  All right, you guys.  You wrote that word.  No, you don't have to go.  Stop with the have to go.  Stay on the line.  If you hang up,  you're going to look real silly.  Listen to me.  Forget about the twit.  Forget about the twit thing, okay?  Why does it say,  unfortunately,  that also means  Opie and Anthony  may be with us  a little longer.  Forget about the twit  or the name calling or whatever.  What is it about us  that you don't like 
[02:35:30]  that you mention us  three times negatively  in your article?  Well, for one thing,  you guys are spending  about ten minutes  on a nationally syndicated  radio show,  which is,  as you know,  every minute is crucial,  talking to some writer  for Wire Magazine  who popped up  in an article  for a few paragraphs.  Now, let me describe  a little bit  about our program,  which you don't seem  that informed about.  We do things like this  because it's real life.  It's something  that affects us.  Our listeners enjoy  kind of a behind-the-scene look 
[02:36:00]  when we pull the curtain back.  And instead of coming up  with wacky bits  and things that are twittish  and doofus-like,  we like being real  and putting real situations  on the air,  and that's what we're  doing right now.  This is real life.  You're calling some guy  who writes for Wired Magazine,  and that's something  that's a lot of listeners  in the world.  It's affecting,  yeah,  you wrote it about  our program.  Our listeners  are interested  in what goes on  and what we do  and people that like 
[02:36:30]  and don't like us,  so we're having  a discussion with you.  Yes, that's real life.  And you seem to be  saying something like,  you shouldn't say something  like,  if you write an article,  we're giving the article,  like,  okay,  this guy wrote an article,  and then you're going,  well,  I'm just a guy  who wrote an article.  Why give me credit?  So you can't write the article  and say things,  and then when people  ask you about it,  just go,  well,  I'm just a little guy  who wrote an article.  That's kind of a pop-out, dude.  Yeah,  you can't even explain yourself,  and we bring all the articles  written about us  to the attention  of our listeners.  We're not attacking you.  We're asking you honestly. 
[02:37:00]  Steve,  I think you've never heard our show.  You can see some of the trouble  we get into,  and you've informed  this opinion  that we're twits.  Yeah,  so tell me about your show.  No,  no,  we don't,  see,  I knew it.  You don't know our show,  but you're writing twits,  like you know about our show,  that you listen to our show,  that you're educated about our show,  but you're not,  are you?  Well,  I think that this is going in circles,  so I'm going to... 
[02:37:30]  No,  it's not.  See,  if you said,  if you said,  but if you said,  it's unfortunate  that Opie and Anthony  are still going to be on K-Rock,  you've formed an opinion  on our show  that is negative  based on what?  On listening to it  or on other people's opinions  on the news?  What type of research  did you do?  Oh,  he's gone.  He hung up.  That guy's everything.  And by the way,  that's the reason  I hate critics.  And that guy right there 
[02:38:00]  personifies  what little faggots,  seriously,  what little faggots  most of these writers are.  Like,  nobody was screaming  at the guy.  No.  Instead of admitting,  like,  I'm ill-informed  or I believed  what I saw on the news,  he was trying to have  some kind of,  oh,  no,  I just,  you know,  I'm going to stand by it.  This is going in circles.  You see what a faggot  most of these guys are  when they're not hiding 
[02:38:30]  behind their fucking laptop.  And he talks about  how the people meter  is in New York and Houston.  It's only in Houston.  It's not in New York yet.  So the guy,  the guy didn't even have  his info right about  the people meter,  the portable people meter  that he was writing about  in this Wired Magazine article.  Steve Knopper,  K-N-O-P-P-E-R.  And,  he's a fraud.  Jesus.  He's another fraud  and I'm glad that  we were able to expose that.  All I want to do  is ask the guy  if he would have said  if you call us twits,  then you should have  a reason why  you're calling us twits 
[02:39:00]  in an article  that a lot of people  are going to read.  Hi, yeah.  How about the fact  that you spent  about 10 minutes,  15 minutes  making fun of retarded people?  That, to me,  I think is a doofus  and a twip.  Oh, wow.  I think he's got us there.  How come everything's  got to turn into  some kind of fucking  butt-a-fuck joke  when you're talking about...  Oh, my God.  We're in trouble now  talking to this guy.  He does seem informed  about the program.  We goof on retards  and talk about butt-fucking.  Or at least we'd know 
[02:39:30]  why he had the opinion.  At least we'd know  something that he heard  the show.  For the love of God.  You didn't even hear  the show.  Come on a minute.  You didn't even hear it.  It's nice that we have  a reputation out there  that guys can write about us  that have never heard  the radio show.  He was shaking.  There's nothing worse  than some fucking  pussy boy writer  who can't even explain  why he wrote  what he wrote  to people who aren't  yelling and screaming at him.  No.  We were quiet.  He would have been able  to say what he had to say.  What a little 
[02:40:00]  faggot motherfucker.  Yeah, I hope he was  expecting that.  That he was expecting  just to be piled on  and yelled at  and be the martyr reporter.  And he just came off  looking like an uninformed dick.  And it's like,  hey, you little failed musician.  You fucking little  wedding band failed musician.  Don't try to fucking  alpha male  and put...  And this was his  attempt to control.  Well, you guys  have to prove to me.  The burden of proof  is on you.  Is it?  Not really.  You wrote the article.  You wrote it.  The burden of proof  is to you  to back up  what you said. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  Yeah, if you're  going to say  ever wonder  why those twits  Opie and Anthony  get to be radio stars,  then all right,  we call you out on that.  Then you back it up.  Why are we twits?  And he won't say  the word twit.  Okay, then you drop  the word twit.  I liked unfortunately  that also means  Opie and Anthony  will maybe be with us  a little longer.  He's saying unfortunately  it's bad  that we're going to be  around a bit longer.  All right.  Why?  Why does he  and he couldn't  even answer that.  Steve Knopper  at yahoo.com  is on his site  and I guess  that's where he writes. 
[02:41:00]  So maybe people  know him.  If anybody here  knows him,  I would encourage you  if maybe one of you guys  out there is friends with him.  If you could write him  and ask him  why he would do that.  That's what these guys do too.  They just write it.  No one calls him out on it.  Then the second  you call him out on it,  you find out  what uninformed  little dickbags  they are.  He's everything  I fucking detest  in the media  because he's a little  he's a pussy boy.  He's not comfortable  unless he is surrounded  by probably his  faggoty Dave Matthews songs 
[02:41:30]  and his laptop.  That's what he's comfortable.  He can write an article  but then when you ask him  why did you write that about  us or this show  he has no answer.  Yeah.  He's just a little  and then he goes  a little fucking front  and then he kind of  admitted that we're right.  He's like well tell me  about your show.  I'm like no.  You tell us.  That was great.  This article makes it  look like you know  a lot about us.  Why did I absolutely know  that that conversation  was going to go  exactly the way it went?  I was not surprised 
[02:42:00]  for one second  during that whole exchange.  This guy has written  a lot of stuff  written for Rolling Stone.  He's written for  the Chicago Tribune.  Another article  for Rolling Stone.  So this guy's  a legitimate writer.  He's written a lot of things  but when you see  what he is as a man  is he's a little fucking  a little wishy-washy  cunt of a man  who can't just justify  why he wrote  what he wrote.  I think we got to get  to Steve Knopper's bosses  and go hey  why do you allow a guy  to write about something 
[02:42:30]  he obviously is  uninformed about.  Send him the tape.  If it's a blog  and he has an opinion  that's one thing  but when you're writing  for something  you know I mean again  he didn't state anything  as fact  he's allowed  to have his opinion.  There's a reason  why he's calling us  twits.  What is it?  But the guy  can't back anything up.  I think the reason  is because he's heard  about us  in the big boy media  of course  and just assumes  that he knows  about us  without ever listening  to one show  or one bit.  The main problem  with him though  by the way 
[02:43:00]  is that he fucked up  the Arbitron thing  as to where these  people leaders  were going to be.  Yeah that too.  New York  he didn't have  his facts right  about the actual  equipment.  Yeah we didn't  even get to that  point where he  didn't have  the facts right  as to where  these people  meters are.  They're not  in New York yet.  You know who  gave him a beating  is Mike  from FMQB.com?  Yeah.  Oh my god.  Mike.  Oh you're singing.  That's being a twit 
[02:43:30]  and a goofus  just making noises.  You're being a goofus.  A doofus.  I'm sorry.  A doofus.  God that was great.  I'm actually happy  he did what he did  because people like  think like  why do you hate critics  why do you hate that  it's like that's why  it's not the necessary  opinion that they have  it's that they form  an opinion like that  and they write it  and they come from  this perspective  of authority  this perspective  of insider knowledge.  Did you see my piece  that I wrote?  Oh nice piece  yes very nice piece  you know  and then they hide behind 
[02:44:00]  this is what I love too  when you call them out  well why  why are you wasting  your time talking to me  it's like no no no  you didn't write something  from that point of view  you didn't write this  from the point of view  of I'm a little man  and I'm an uninformed  jerk off  had you written  from that point of view  we wouldn't have  called you out on it  but you didn't  you wrote from the point of view  of being a guy  who's informed  and a guy who's  in the know  and when you're talked to  man to man  and not yelled at  and not bullied  you're a cunt  for real  I'm not even  you're a cunt  and you actually 
[02:44:30]  your wife  I hope your wife  heard that  because she's also  a writer from Columbia  and I hope you can  look at each other  when you fuck  and she realizes  that she would have  handled that  the same way  you would have  there's some communication  going back and forth  with Mike and this guy  from FMQB  he explains why  he's misinformed  about the whole  people meter  oh he does  portable people meter  which will bore the hell  out of the audience  and I don't know  how far we could get  into that to begin with  but then he writes  this is Mike  sticking up for us  in return for  fact checking your article 
[02:45:00]  do you think you explain  why  the ONA references  were needed  in the article  I get it  you aren't a fan  if that is the reason  then just say so  in the article  but to suggest  Arbitron methodology  is the reason  doofus shock jocks  stay on the air  is just ludicrous  if anything  PPM will only enhance  ONA's rating status  as their target demos  one Arbitron  had issues with  reaching by using  the diary method  so he calls him out  are you just saying it  because you're not a fan 
[02:45:30]  then say so  yeah he kind of  used the article  which has nothing to do  with personal taste  in radio shows  it's an article about  the people meter  versus the old way  that Arbitron worked  and he's got to throw in  this little  personal sniper shot  at the show  Steve wrote Mike  from FMQB back  he writes  the ONA references  were perhaps  gratuitous  thank you guys  but the logic seems  commonsensical  no  look at him 
[02:46:00]  commonsensical  Arbitron Diaries  said they liked the show  therefore it got good ratings  and had stayed on the air  all these years  I am fairly confident  that if it did not  get good ratings  it would have been  cancelled long ago  well  yeah that's how it works  duh  but then not only  Arbitron  not only Arbitron  hit me  Arbitron isn't the only  thing that has proven  that this is a successful  show you idiot  go to one of our  comedy shows  and sit outside  the venue  for two hours  after the show  is over  as we're greeting  our fans  but do you hear  the snotty tone 
[02:46:30]  what a douche  hear the snotty tone  you know  grab  probably gratuitous  it's like  can you just be  the little shaky handed  faggot that you are  stop trying for empowerment  through your writing  you're a frightened  little fellow  I heard it  and then he writes  and then he writes  this is hilarious  I'm to be on O&A  tomorrow morning  to respond  that should be interesting  I'd encourage you  to write a letter  to Wired  if my answer  is not sufficient  well  how about that  it wasn't  it wasn't even close  to sufficient  and because that  again 
[02:47:00]  is him expecting  a pile on  when he called up  he expected  a three man  pile on  where he wasn't  going to get a word  in edgewise  and see  this is why  I don't like your show  because you don't  let people talk  blah blah blah  whatever  but we gave him  all the courtesy  and all the opportunity  to voice his opinion  and his take  on his own article  and look at what we got  well I'm going to hang up  if he would have said  I'll stand by my words  if he would have said  I think you're twitched  because you had sex  in a church  and you did this  and that 
[02:47:30]  even if I disagree  with him  at least he has read  had something  dude you write  anything  he writes for Rolling  he's a writer  he has to reach back  years ago  to find something  whatever  you're like a professional  writer though  you're not like a fucking guy  who's just blogging at home  you're a professional writer  which gives you  some type of credibility  but I like the fact  that like naked  that's what you are  you don't understand  a lot of people out there  probably don't understand  the joy we get  yes  in something like that  that beats the hell  out of just yelling  at somebody  beats the hell 
[02:48:00]  out of just yelling  let's not take that  out of the equation  hell no  it's fun to yell  I like that  alright good  but something like that  as far as satisfaction goes  is just like good  he just  he pretty much  laid out  what he was all about  we didn't even have to  raise a hand  I love when we could  you know  beat someone up  with our brains  he's just a snot  our brain power  you don't even have to be smart  to beat him up  he's a snot  he's a front of the bus  fucking snot  he's a fucking  hall monitor snot  and he's a snarky 
[02:48:30]  bloggy type  cunt of a message board  dude  that's the vibe  I'm not attacking  on message boards  I'm talking about  the ones  that will just  that will kind of  bitch you  anonymously  even though he wasn't  anonymous  when eye to eye  he couldn't say  yeah this is why  I don't like you  I'm still trying to  get over the fact  I said  that's alright  what a snotty  failed musician  cunt of a man  talking about me  no no no 
[02:49:00]  oh shit  can you say snot again  I like when you use snot  he is a snot  that's what he  he's like a little  he's a little elitist  snot  but he's not a good  enough writer  or smart enough  a good writer  who really wanted  to eviscerate the show  never would have been  this sloppy  that's the greatest crime  is not knowing  where these things  debuted  you're writing  a factual article  you dumb motherfucker  yeah take us  out of the whole mix  it's still a piece of shit  it's still an inaccurate  article  it's still an inaccurate  piece of shit  hey we gotta take a break  when we get back 
[02:49:30]  Kenny was telling me  a story on the way  into it  oh Christ  who did he kill  and when  they got it on MSNBC  it's another home invasion  oh god damn  with pitbulls  do we have the story  what  with pitbulls  we got the story  I need a new defense  kibble  wait till you hear this one  and we got the  Alex  Alex  Alec or Alec  Alex Trebek  Alex Trebek  Alex Trebek  outtakes from Jeopardy  on the way  yes  O&A  hey  working hard  playing hard  America  this is your blood brother  of all things  sonic bombast

[02:59:00]  big paunch  there's an article here  by the way  it says pull  white youths  happier than others  really  and I'm like  was that really  necessary to write up  do you have to  you gotta say  rub salt in the wounds  yeah we do have  the advantage  I mean we  you know  come on  I'm not being a  flaming liberal here  when I say that  white people are  better off in the world  as far as  financially and stuff  are they  yeah I think so  I mean no wonder  they're happier  I don't know  where are you  getting your facts  when you look  around the world  oh  I mean I understand  by that  are you 
[02:59:30]  yeah I mean  it's your job  to prove to me  that non-whites  have more money  between what age  because I know  there's an age  in there somewhere  yeah don't mess  with stats  with Anthony  1324  1324  sure  and most of them  are probably  I'm guessing suburban  and have less fear  than city kids would have  you know when you're suburban  you have less  suburban white kids  between that age  are usually having  a good time  or killing themselves  or others  so yeah  but for the most part  I remember those years  very fun  very fun being white  and being that age 
[03:00:00]  well you don't realize  how awful the world is  because like you know  black kids  and Spanish kids  a lot of them  are in the cities  or in shitty neighborhoods  and they see violence  all the time  you don't see that  usually in suburbia  during that age bracket too  you know you're either  in a gang  or getting  put in prison  or something  that's  of course  white  little kids  would be happier  I was just discovering  that my cock  did a fine  spitting cobra impression  when tugged on  appropriately  I was so stupid  the first time  I had to come  I didn't know 
[03:00:30]  what it was  just a fucking  dumb little boy  so I felt it building  I felt it building  and then I stopped  and ran to the bathroom  and held my penis  over the toilet  and nothing happened  nothing happened  no  because you  like stopped  it went away  it went away  did you do it  until it came back again  no I was a little nervous  the next day though  I did  and well  life changed  what happened  did you like  did you like  freak out  when it came out  I don't remember  I remember  I used to jerk off 
[03:01:00]  so much  that I remember  I'd go home  for break  from 8th grade  because I went to  7th and 8th grade  across the street  from my house  I'd go home  for lunch break  and I would just  jerk off  and I would doze off  with the load  on my stomach  I wouldn't clean up  I would come home  from school  and just whack off  on myself  and then fall asleep  with it all over  my stomach  oh Jesus  I jerked off  one time  watching Happy Days  on my black and white TV  didn't matter  what it was  I was just doing it  for the third time  my dick was totally limp  and I remember seeing  Tom Bosley  on the set  on a black and white set  and I'm like  this is becoming a problem  you don't want to  jerk off to Tom Bosley 
[03:01:30]  no I wasn't  I just happened  it was some fantasy  about this girl  lint skirt or something  I remember  the first time  jacking  I was under the impression  that  just the feeling  of the building  was jerking off  that was finishing  because then you get  you know  you get some gooey shit  you know  all that stuff  comes out  the preak  preak hum  right  so you think  that that  I thought  see here's how stupid  you are as a kid  I thought that was  coming 
[03:02:00]  and as you're  jacking  it's feeling better  and better  and it's like  wow  something's building up  and I'm like  oh man  look  I jerked off  but I kept going  because it felt good  and then it's like  holy fuck  what is this  it's a scary  scary thing  what the fuck  is this  the first time  you go the distance  because I remember  like Jimmy  I was too scared  to continue  because I'm like  I don't know  what the fuck  is going to happen  something's building  up here  like a sneeze  yeah my ball's  going to explode  what's going to happen 
[03:02:30]  that's what it was  and then  once I got over  the fact that  holy shit  what the fuck  was that  then it was like  wow  well now I know  I do that everywhere  right  I do that every minute  every second  where I am  I don't care  I'm jerking off  if I could go back  and change it  I would  I would  oh would you  yeah  what would you do  more  I do it more  you do it more  yes  no I would do it healthier  I wouldn't make myself  stop before I came  it fucked me up sexually  like I always make myself  yeah I'll jerking off  a little for hours  oh yeah but every kid's 
[03:03:00]  done that too  yeah I know  but I'm 39 now  oh man  okay sorry  it's not good  you still do that  where it's just  jerk jerk jerk  wait  find something better  click click  point click  that one's good  jerk jerk jerk jerk  nah  I can find something better  you ever get it to the point  where uh  it's it's so sensitive  you're just like  flicking it every once in a while  for a  yes  wow  I'll do this on the back  like I'll just slap the back  just a little slap  and you get just a little  like tingle  like you know  if you flick twice 
[03:03:30]  it's over Johnny  but you're just like  every once in a while  just to get a nice little feeling  and you see what kind of  discipline you really have  and then you're like  ah fuck it  every time you tap it  the cum parade starts  and they all march up  to the helmet  and go alright  go back  go back  not too far  cum parade  it fucking marches up  all back up a little bit  and they wait to catch you  yeah here he is  any second now  any second  and you're just like  every once in a while  oh  oh that feels really good  well that's right  that was close  wow that was good 
[03:04:00]  okay  that was a close one  alright hold back  alright hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  oh  oh  oh  oh  damn  was that close  I almost had to  come and  wow  have a productive day  doing something  wow that feels good  instead of doing this  for another three hours  wait I think I can go  tap tap  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  goes back in  okay  goes back in  and then you guess  I think I can get three  I think I can get three  ah  a guish 
[03:04:30]  a guish  a guish  and the worst is when you're jerking off in a peep booth  because like  can't uh  you just lost me  the way it is  my legs are spread  the booth is small  so my left foot and my right foot are both pressed against the fucking bottom side of the wall  you know  and you're jerking off and you're pointing your dick down when you have to come  and when you come you have to brace your hand on the wall above you  and you just come on the floor  and it's not quite as  it's just wrong  it's like  and you come on the floor  that sounds horrible  and your legs are numb  you have like toilet 
[03:05:00]  I mean  two long legs  and my fucking legs are numb  and then you gotta straighten up  which is  like a newborn fawn  there you go  it's awful  you gotta shake your helmet  wipe the tip off  cause you got fucking a load on it  and then you have to walk out  and hope you don't see people you know  hey how you doing shaking hands with people  dad  dad  dad what are you doing here  yeah  without you going  to the next booth  uh  Mike in Cleveland  what's up  no  hey  hey what's up  yeah the first time I jerked off man 
[03:05:30]  I was in the bathtub  and I poured some shampoo  on my little boy cock  and I started rubbing it with my fingers  and when it  when I finally blew my load  I thought it was the shampoo  that did it  so  I kept running to the bathroom  about twice a day  to take a bath  poured shampoo on my dick  my mom was bitching about it  who's going through all the shampoo  he thought the shampoo  did it  I tried to fuck something  one time 
[03:06:00]  I talked about this years ago  um  I read it in a porn magazine  I hollowed out a banana  and I uh  I duct taped it around the outside  and I put warm water in it  and I tried to fuck that  because I read about it  it was awful  my limp dick  just dangled in lukewarm water  yeah  yeah  did that work out for you  horrendously  my dick just smelled like banana  when I was done  there's a  no load  no nothing  just me dumping out a fucking  a duct taped banana  what's the prison pussy  it's a washcloth  you need a washcloth  rubber bands 
[03:06:30]  and a surgical glove  right  and you uh  you take the surgical glove  leave the wrist  uh  out of the uh  washcloth a little bit  you lay it on top  and leave a little overhang  of the wrist  and then you  you roll the uh  the washcloth up  real tight  and then you put  the rubber bands on it  and then you uh  fold the cuff  that's sticking out of the  the uh  end of it  over the edges  and then you  run it under warm water  and then you lose  some kind of lube 
[03:07:00]  in there  you gotta use a little lube  and then you  you stick your dick in it  and it's really tight  and uh  slimy because of the lube  and hot  because of the water  and then you could  fuck that  or some  waif in the shower  wow  what it's just  if you need to  hey you know something  I just informed somebody  and they're gonna  they're gonna try that  it's an informative program  can I show you  the genius of prisoners though  I mean there really are  some inventive guys  in jail  like what you will  be able to come up with 
[03:07:30]  grilled cheese  they make grilled cheese  on fucking heaters  I mean they just do  shit out of everything  that must be tasty  oh  big fucking toenail  clippings in it  use lad bag  from uh  Boston's whack bag  use lad bag  uh  but the worst  the worst  is getting too close  try to hold back  and then busting  when you don't want to  so then you have to  hurry hurry hurry  to make sure you get  all the poison out  all the poison  you don't want to dribble 
[03:08:00]  last night  I was fucking  my girlfriend  I got home  we were gonna fuck  we ordered a little bit  of food  because she was hungry  so I figured  we could fuck real quick  before the food got there  and uh  so I went down on her  and um  it was my turn  so we're fucking  it was really good  and I was really close  and then my  the awful phone  when security  had to call up  and I fucking  I tried  she's like  come on  just keep going  just come  and I couldn't  because I kept  carrying the phone  I think they're gonna  leave with the food  so I backed out  with old slimy dick 
[03:08:30]  and I had to run  me and slimy dick  had to run into  the fucking kitchen  and pick up the phone  yeah you could send  the food up  my fucking  wilting slimy dick  it was fucking horrible  you make it sound  so sexy  old slimy  that's what I had  Jesus  is there anything worse  when you pull your dick  out of a vagina  and look at it  it feels good  but it's just awful  it's like a fucking  like a big pale  slug  hanging there  with gunk on it  on a strong  drooling  yeah just drooling 
[03:09:00]  clear stuff  you guys want to  talk about pit bulls  where's that story  sure  people calling in  drinking off pit bulls  well people are  calling in on this subject  we'll go back to it  no worries  but another home invasion  we got that story  Kenny was telling you  about this  of course he was  it's negative  home invasion  they sent  I think  I gotta get the story  but they sent  two pit bulls  through the doggy door  these people with  the fucking doggy doors  what are you stupid 
[03:09:30]  what are you stupid  how do people have  doggy doors  that's crazy  that's like  here it is  it's outside  there's no security  there  no lock  go ahead  have fun  fuck that  but nobody sent them  the dogs just came in  didn't they  no  yes  really  yes  I thought that was  part of the thing  unless I'm reading  an older article  alright let's see  two pit bulls  broke into a house  through a pet door  Tuesday and attacked  a woman in her bed  mauling her badly 
[03:10:00]  the woman was able  to grab a gun  and try to shoot  the dogs  then break away  from the attack  and lock herself  in her car  where she called  911  how do you know  there isn't  somebody else  involved with this  and they ran away  because it didn't  work out like he wanted  I don't know  from what I heard  from Kenny  he sounded confused  about it this morning  no it just sounds  to me like two dogs  got around  and you know  that's crazy  the woman who was  not immediately identified  was taken to a hospital  in Tacoma  where she was listed  in serious condition  the pit bulls  also killed  a neighbor's  Jack Russell Terrier  which entered  the house  during the attack  why  what the hell 
[03:10:30]  is the dog  going in there for  why  what's wrong  with people  dogs  officers planned  to talk to the dogs  the thought is  that the Jack Russell  heard noise  in the neighbor's house  came in  and was attacked  by the dogs  firefighters responded  first locking  the dogs in the house  treating the woman  and calling for an ambulance  officers had to  pepper spray  and fight the dogs  until they were detained  we almost had to  shoot them  on sight  it was not immediately  known why the dogs  entered the house  whether the woman  had dogs of her own  or what set off her  set off the attack 
[03:11:00]  she was in her meat robe  for the night  put on her beef robe  what the fuck  I would not have  a doggy door  that's a  that's a security breach  technically the dogs  do what they're supposed  to do  you see a doggy door  you walk in  walk in  yeah  go through it  and start eating  it's an old lady  well Kenny is  really dumb  because he said  there was another  home invasion  and listen what  they did this time  they let  dogs in the dog door  what 
[03:11:30]  no there was  a home invasion  oh wow  listen to Mongo  Mongo  morning guys  hey mom  when I was in  Desert Storm  I was right at the  point of no return  and they had a  fucking incoming  scud missile alarm  lights come on  everybody  everybody goes  running out of the  running out of the  tent to get into  the bomb shelter  and they look at me  and they're like  I'll be right there  I couldn't  I just said  point of no return  there was nothing  I could do  I caught shit 
[03:12:00]  for months over that  oh cause they knew  what you were doing  oh yeah  I had my  fucking sleeping bag  wrapped around my  cock stroking  and of course  I knew  what I was doing  it was nothing  it was just  it was just  okay  well okay  I'll catch shit  about this for a while  hey at least  you weren't  blowing somebody  like you were  in Biloxi Blues  it could have been worse  it could have been worse  very good Mongo  let's go to Rob  on Long Island  Rob what's up  hey Rob  what's up guys  yeah when I was 12  the first time  I ever jerked off 
[03:12:30]  was to Mom and Dad  Save the World  what is that  the most atrocious  movie there ever was  basically up until  that point  like every time  I would like  try to jerk off  I would reach a point  to where I would  feel something  and didn't know  what it was  so I would stop  and then one morning  I just went with it  and went with it  and that movie  happened to be on  and every time  I was basically  waiting for  I don't know what  I forgot her name  in that movie  do you know  who the lead was  in that movie  Kathy Bates  Esther Rowe  that would be hot 
[03:13:00]  it was Terry Gar  everyone knows that  yes every time  she would pop up  on the screen  that I would like  go like a rabbit  and then wait for her  to like pop back on  basically  but yeah  just basically  jerking it to that  Terry Gar  in what year  in 92  the only good part  of that movie  was Kathy Ireland  she was a hot  piece of ass  back then  that movie also  I think starred  John Lovitz  if I'm not mistaken  and the great  Eric Idle  but the movie itself  blew  am I right  I'm 24  I was just waiting 
[03:13:30]  for it to like  it was on HBO  one morning  and I just went  oh you can jerk  off to Kathy Ireland  back in 92  that's easy  that's no problem  there  the challenge is  jerking off to  Terry Gar  not Terry Gar  yuck  Terry Gar you could  jerk off to  probably in a  Star Trek episode  back in the 60s  never sexy by the way  no  I try to make her  like kind of a sexy  it kind of looked  sexy  never sexy  in that Star Trek  episode  which one  it was like the  last Star Trek  that was made  movie  it was the one  where  of course

[03:23:30]  do  you  leave  them  alone  do  you lick  them a little  what do  you do  with the  balls  do you tick  them a little  bit  so you don't  touch the  balls  while you're  sucking  cock  right  so you  do  suck  cock  I don't  do  either  man  oh shit  my boss  is coming  hello  and there  they go  did we give  away any  tickets  yeah  I guess  I think  by accident  we gave  one away  can we  please tape 
[03:24:00]  the CNN  NAACP  that's what  I want to  hear  I'm sure  it's a  very poignant  well thought  out  news conference  I want to  hear  there's an  NAACP  press conference  going on  now about  the Michael  Vick situation  oh boy  so they're  putting their  their hat  in the ring  here and  putting out  a little  statement  as NFL  Falcons  sponsors  not to  ban Vic  permanently  why would  the NAACP  get involved  in a fucking  animal abuse  case  why  why  have black 
[03:24:30]  people become  so obsessed  with race  that they would  get involved  with this  such a negative  thing  who got caught  fucking up  they're asking  the NFL  the Falcons  and the  sponsors  dog lovers  not to  so the  NFL  concerned  about  his  image  may  want  to  suspend  him  for  however  long  and you're  saying  a suspension  would be  unfair  I know  we're not  saying that  a suspension  would be  unfair 
[03:25:00]  but what  we are  saying  let's  maintain  our  humanness  when we  are  trying to  remedy the  whole situation  yes there are  many dog  lovers  fans  in the  NFL  but there are  also  many many  other people  who just  love my  dick  did you  guys talk  about this  before you  decided to  go on  the air  with it  recognize  that 
[03:25:30]  whether it's  Michael  Vick  or anybody  humans  are  redeemable  now  in some  instances  I believe  Michael  Vick  has received  more negative  press  than if he  had killed  a human  being  amen  the way  he is  being  persecuted  like  Imus  he wouldn't  have been  persecuted  that much  had he  killed  somebody  really  like OJ  the NAACP 
[03:26:00]  is so  off base  how irrelevant  is that  fucking  organization  holy  Jesus  I gotta  hear that  entire  speech  they should  name that  organization  we defend  blacks  regardless  of what  they do  in society  based on  their skin  color  right  they are  basing it  on skin  color  the thing  you're not  supposed to  do  holy  Jesus  Palomino  that was  the most 
[03:26:30]  that was  the lamest  excuse  I've ever  heard  for somebody  sticking up  for somebody  else  that is  I'm stunned  what a terrible  organization  the NAACP  is  Michael  Vic  is  everything  that's  wrong  when  you're  famous  how  about  this  you  dumb  motherfuckers  at the  NAACP  how about  you look  at it  like here's  a guy  who little  kids love  and how  about this  not just  white kids  love him  black kids  love him  how about  this  they wear  his jersey  and they  emulate him 
[03:27:00]  and you  you take  a guy  like that  and this  is what  he does  how about  that  I'm not  saying he's  not redeemable  as a human  being  but you're  gonna go  on there  on the  base of  his skin  color  just  100%  based on  his skin  color  they're  defending  it has  nothing  to do  with  anything  but his  skin  color  unbelievable  yeah  I miss  his  redeemable  where's  the NAACP  fighting for  where  come on  he's  redeemable  he didn't  kill  anything  he was  persecuted  like he  killed  dogs  he didn't  kill  anything  people  right  there's  a lot  of people  that love  Mr. 
[03:27:30]  Imus  fucking  phony  culture  we live  in  worlds  apart  just  doomed  as a  society  doomed  they're  no different  than a special  interest group  they're the  tobacco lobby  they're the  same people  and they  are irrelevant  their time  has passed  it's gone  there was a  time where  they were  needed  they did  good  they got  things done  that needed  to be done  in this  country  and then  once that  happens  all of a  sudden  you become  irrelevant  and they're  still  instead of  fighting for  things like 
[03:28:00]  talking about  institutionalized  racism  and all  these other  things  to come  on television  and first  they want  to bury  the n-word  and then  they want  to have  a lot  of people  fans of  mike vick  you're the  president of  the organization  and that's  what you say  there's a lot  of dog lovers  out there  we know  but there's  a lot of  fans of  mike vick  too  they think  he's being  persecuted  perhaps also  it's not just  the idea  that he did  this  for dog 
[03:28:30]  fighting  but just  to have  the potential  psychologically  to do  such horrendous  things  to a living  animal  not hunting  you know  hunters  that's one  thing  and people  are not  into hunting  too  I understand  that  but it's  different  a hunter  for the most  part  there are  some sadistic  bastards out  there that  hunt also  but for the  most part  there's this  respect for  the hunt  and the  animal  and the  tradition  that goes  along with  it  now a lot  of people  won't agree  with that  but so  be it  but the  dog fighting 
[03:29:00]  and the  killing  the hanging  the drowning  of an animal  like that  there has to be  something in you  psychologically  that ain't  fucking right  that you have  something in your  mind that is  just teetering  on serial killer  kind of that  weird murderous  mentality  it's one thing  to kill a dog  but the way  he was killing  dogs is really  fucking twisted  you can't fault  the dog pound  guy for throwing  a dog in the  gas chamber  and you know  hitting the gas  or giving him  the blue fluid  if you gotta 
[03:29:30]  put him down  he's not  in the same  thing as  somebody hanging  a dog  and killing  him that way  you know how twisted  you have to be  to hang  or drown  a dog  when you  could probably  shoot it  when you  could probably  shoot a dog  in the head  and make it  go away  like that  and how about  the guy  if you're gonna  kill a dog  obviously  because I can't  even get to  that point  where you  would actually  kill a dog  we wanted  to take  the guy  was saying  it wasn't  based on race  and my point  was well no  it is  they're defending  him we think  based on race  and then you  come out with  this  it is a hundred  percent based 
[03:30:00]  on his race  that they are  coming out  he's pleading  guilty  having fucking  tortured these  animals  to make some  money  you fucking  idiots  by the way  Arnold White  from the NAACP  wait wait  do we have  that clip  yeah he said  many people  love my dick  instead of  Michael Vick  oh sorry  is it  I'm sorry  and I didn't  know you were  like  no no I think  did you cut it  okay that was  kind of the gag  oh  see I don't  know  we're usually 
[03:30:30]  on the same  page we blow  it today  let's hear this  but there are  also many  many other  people who  just love  my dick  what  yeah  see we  misunderstood  him  oh all right  then everything's  okay he just  wants to tell  people that  everyone loves  his dick  holy shit  man is there  a fine in  this  you can't say 
[03:31:00]  that on TV  go ahead  but there are  also many  many other  people who  just love  my dick  see  all right  now it's  different  now it makes  sense  now we're all  happy again  dude did he  say Michael  at first  no Mike  Vick  no  no this is  not cut up  this is what  he said  I thought  you cut  the end  no  holy shit  that's what I  was trying to  say this is  how it came  in  can we  we didn't  fuck it 
[03:31:30]  we didn't  oh that's  hysterical  we didn't  cut this  hear it again  yeah  but there are  also many  many other  people who  just love  my dick  okay  wow  that sounds  like my  dick  that is  god damn  funny  oh my  how  how  wow  wow  what's  on this  guy's  mind  right  they love  my dick  he's gonna  get us a  longer version  to prove it  no that's  what he  said  yeah  wow  he's just 
[03:32:00]  said many  people love  my dick  could somebody  explain the  NAACP  please  irrelevant  can somebody  explain to  the NAACP  that this is  different  than the  yeah exactly  where are they  here  yeah where's  the NAACP  with these  students that  were shot  in Newark  execution style  I guess they  don't want to  come out  why don't they  want to talk  about it  because it  deals with  immigration  now  talk about  that because  it's an  immigration  case  yeah  it's not  white on  black  it's  illegal  immigrant 
[03:32:30]  from  central  america  on black  crime  where are  they  oh  it's  amazing  unbelievable  they should  be in  Newark  just  livid  about the  number of  black people  that are  being killed  in Newark  but no  he's defending  my dick  well  how many people  love my dick  I do  thank you  Jimmy  I love my dick  well I love  my dick  Jimmy loves 
[03:33:00]  them both  you like  Anthony's  well  I've never  seen it  but I imagine  it's  sweaty  from being  rolled up  like a  giant  sock  saucer  in his  fucking  pants  it's  probably  perspires  by the end  of the day  because it's  just been  flesh on  flesh  it's rolled  up like a  fucking  flesh rug  cock like a  flesh rug  here's the  long version  to prove that  he said  many people  love my  dick  trying to  remedy the  whole situation  yes there  are many  dog lovers 
[03:33:30]  fans in  the NFL  but there  are also  many many  other people  who just  love my  dick  holy  love my  dick  god  that is  great  boy R.L. White's  gonna be a  YouTube star  today  god what a  fucking  what a  sickening  position  for an  organization like  that to  take  what a  fucking  revolting  predictable  position  everything  they do  these days
