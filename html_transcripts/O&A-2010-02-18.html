<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the usual string of "Next" cues, followed by the hosts' self-aware acknowledgement of the show's filler content while simultaneously expressing their genuine enjoyment of being on the air.  Opie ironically labeled the broadcast "fun and safe."  After the introduction, the hosts immediately shifted to a discussion of Tiger Woods' upcoming prepared statement, expressing disinterest in the specifics of his personal life and hoping for his return to professional golf.  They highlighted that Woods was giving a statement, not a full press conference with a Q&A session, to a carefully chosen audience of friends and sponsors.  This controlled approach, they noted, had already irritated some people.

[00:03:30]  Next.  We still love doing radio, by the way.  Love it!  You heard it here, folks.  Don't I like about our show?  It's fun and safe at the same time.  We're popular!  See, we rule on the radio.  We have a good 40 minutes, an average 120, an hour of filler, and an hour of d mejorar.  What the fuck is going on? 
[00:04:00]  Stereo actor.  And you, I don't go to your job and suck old a dick that you work with.  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be starstruck.  Who gives a shit?  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Shue.  Hi, everybody.  Hey, lots to do today. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Fucking Tiger Woods, everybody.  Well, apparently.  I love Tiger Woods. I'll tell you why.  I guess the world needs answers. I don't need answers.  I'm a golf fan. I don't need answers.  I just want Tiger Woods fucking hitting that white ball around a goddamn course again.  Simple as that.  I am so fine with it.  Right. I don't care.  But already, and when I say I don't care, it's not the famous that means I care thing.  Right.  I really don't care.  I do care that I want him to be playing golf again. 
[00:05:00]  But I already read three or four articles in the paper.  Most people know by now he's going to be talking for the first time tomorrow.  Yes.  And everyone's like, the way he's doing it, they're fucking pissed off.  Because basically what he's doing tomorrow, he's having a press conference, but it's not really a press conference.  He's making a statement.  He's not.  No question.  No questions.  And the people he's inviting is like close friends, close sponsorship type. </pre>
