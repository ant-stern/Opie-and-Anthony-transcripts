<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Whippin' Up Wednesday" (WOW), their annual promotion encouraging women to flash their breasts to drivers displaying WOW stickers or signs.  They detailed past WOW events, including incidents involving the Today Show and arrests on a bus, emphasizing it was intended as a fun, spontaneous interaction, not harassment.  Listeners were instructed on obtaining stickers and encouraged to create homemade signs. Cowbell Bill's past participation was mentioned, and the hosts solicited new WOW songs.  Earl's sticker distribution at Garden State Plaza was extensively covered, with numerous listener calls recounting their encounters (some humorous, some contentious).  Upcoming contests – the Offensive Song Contest (with past entries like "Baby Raper" and "Camp Concentration") and the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest – were also promoted.  A discussion on "straight edge" culture ensued, featuring listener calls and playful mockery of intern Jesse's fashion sense.  A call from Igor, an actor from *The Sopranos*, promoting his events and performing a brief stand-up routine, concluded this segment.


Igor, the *Sopranos* actor,  continued his call, prompting a discussion of past *Sopranos* guests, ranging from Meadow Soprano to a self-described "rapist," and speculation about future guests. The conversation abruptly shifted to Timothy McVeigh's impending execution, sparked by a caller's controversial views on the bombing and execution method.  This led to a debate on capital punishment and the closed-circuit viewing for victims’ families.  The discussion veered into an off-color observation about a woman seen near the studio. Cowbell Bill joined the studio, and calls were taken, most notably from Cream Cup, a phone sex operator. Cream Cup engaged in highly sexually suggestive and inappropriate on-air interaction with a studio guest nicknamed "Stinky," despite the hosts' attempts to keep it vaguely suggestive.  Numerous callers detailed the lethal injection process, fueling more crude jokes and tangents. Christopher Titus, from the Fox show *Titus*, was present in studio during this segment, his comments interspersed with calls and other conversations. The segment concluded with a Vermont Teddy Bear advertisement and further offensive banter with Earl, escalating into highly offensive racial slurs.


The show continued with Christopher Titus recounting a severe burn incident treated with beer instead of medical attention. This transitioned into stories about his father's marijuana cultivation and his own pot-smoking experiences, including an accidental oven fire. A call from Flex in Northern State Prison followed, detailing prison life, the corruption of selling police badges for $5,000, and receiving contraband food from officers.  Next, the hosts interviewed Moose Moran, a Washington D.C. radio DJ, known for his moose hat and repeated playing of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon," including a call from Don Imus berating him.  Lenny Clark, an actor, then discussed his television work, health issues, and encounters with Elizabeth Hurley.  The show concluded with an interview of Jerry from *Survivor*, discussing his time on the show, relationships with other contestants (especially his dislike for Keith), rumored romantic entanglements, and experiences at Burning Man. The conversation was highly suggestive, focusing on physical attributes and personal interactions among the contestants.  Numerous commercial breaks were mentioned, including for Stacker 2, a fat burner.


A phone interview with Jerry from *Survivor* dominated this segment. Opie and Anthony conducted the interview with highly inappropriate and sexually aggressive comments and suggestions, referencing drugs (cocaine, crack, pot), and bizarre sexual acts. They made offensive remarks about Jerry's appearance and speculated on her sexual history.  Caller "Dice" contributed to the offensive banter. Psycho Mark, a studio guest with a Tourette's-like condition, interjected with inappropriate comments. Debbie, a CBS representative, called to express her displeasure, stating the interview was "overboard" and expressing discomfort and fear of repercussions at work. Opie and Anthony attempted to apologize, offering justifications and pleading with Debbie to continue providing *Survivor* guests. The segment ended with a song and commercials, including Avacor hair treatment and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Christopher Titus' presence earlier in the show was mentioned, and other callers shared their reactions to the Jerry interview.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, gentlemen, John, you're wacky.  That's what I want to do!  Are you masking me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, I just make me tangle.  Yeah, my side, I'm cruising down the street.  I need to see me somewhere.  You get me through the weeds.  That's what I want to do on Wednesday.  It's about an annual day. 
[00:00:30]  I can't lose the wheel in the road.  I'm going to make your game.  Hey, everyone, I'm pretty much going to promise you that you may want to win this game.  Wow!  Wow!  All I can say is wow!  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get late.  Time to be dead. 
[00:01:00]  Whippin' up Wednesday!  Woo-hoo!  Oh, wow!  Wow!  What the hell were you thinking?  Wow!  That's a winner!  Pick your ball, but check it off now! 
[00:01:30]  So funny!  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Hurry up, baby. 
[00:02:00]  Don't be.  Save the drama so your mama can push.  Okay, it's a winner.  Pick your ball, but check it off now!  Who's that?  You know what I'm talking about.  What about a huge chicken hooters, huh? 
[00:02:30]  Hey!  Hey, it's the O&A Show.  It's Whippin' Up Wednesday.  Look at that.  The official kickoff of Whippin' Up Wednesday.  It's the first one of the year.  It's time to take over the city once again this fine spring and summer.  Gee, I can only imagine what the headlines will hold for WOW this year. 
[00:03:00]  We got a lot of exposure there last year with WOW.  Yeah.  No pun.  Are we going to outdo ourselves this year, hopefully?  Let's see.  We did have the Today Show thing last year, right?  Yeah, got a little bit of news.  The flashing on the Today Show.  Yeah.  National story there.  Mm-hmm.  Of course, the boobs getting arrested on the Voyager bus was very big.  Yeah, that was huge.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't really wonder what will happen this year.  That's what makes it so interesting.  Mm-hmm.  We always have to outdo ourselves every year.  The Puerto Rican Day Parade.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, that wasn't us. 
[00:03:30]  No.  Everyone said it was.  I know.  What happened?  No, we had nothing to do with that.  Damn.  We don't act like animals when we cruise the highways looking for boobs, right?  No, we just think like them.  Anthony, believe it or not, this is the sixth season of Whippin' Up Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  I remember like it was yesterday when we came up with Whippin' Up Wednesday in Boston.  People said it wouldn't last.  Well, it's lasted.  Yes.  We've been told not to do it twice so far.  We don't listen to anyone. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, we were told not to do it up in Boston.  We did it anyway.  I don't think it was related, but we ended up here after we got fired.  The mayor thinks it had nothing to do with it, right?  No, no.  I think he didn't like us because of it.  Right.  It might have helped in his anger.  Right.  But, no, it's a new season of Wow.  You want to explain Whippin' Up Wednesday?  Because we have probably a bunch of brand-new listeners.  You think so?  Since we last did Whippin' Up Wednesday, I would imagine, yeah.  When you're driving around, maybe this is your first time tuning in, even. 
[00:04:30]  You tripped over the ashtray and fell on the radio and turned the dial to us,  and you're wondering what this is all about.  You see the wows on the back of trucks scratched in the dirt?  You see wow stickers, or cute little wow stickers on the back of cars everywhere and trucks?  What this means is Whippin' Up Wednesday.  Wow.  Right.  And when a girl sees a wow on a car, if she is so inclined and wants to,  she can drive up next to the car with a wow on it and flash her lovely boobs to the driver, 
[00:05:00]  who will be so happy.  We're spreading happiness.  It's not like the contest stickers that some stations put on where,  oh, if we spot you, we'll put you in a drawing,  that if you win the drawing, we put you in another drawing,  and you may win $1,000.  Yeah, you'll be qualified to win a contest that we're doing with our other 10 stations across America.  But we'll give you a keychain anyway.  Yeah.  You know, this, anyone can be a winner anytime. 
[00:05:30]  And the prize, boom.  Yeah, this is why it's the greatest radio promotion of all time,  because we have many, many winners.  Many, many winners.  And all you have to do is drive with a wow on your car.  Now, guys, and you guys have been cool about this in the past.  We don't want you harassing the ladies.  We don't want you following the ladies.  It's simple.  You put the wow sticker on your car, and you just go about your business,  and if it's going to happen, it's going to happen, okay?  It's the easiest contest, or not even contest.  It's the easiest promotion out there.  Right.  If you do nothing but put a wow on your car. 
[00:06:00]  And some of the complaints we got over the years, you know,  ladies calling up going, I'm ready to wow, but no one's paying attention.  No one has stickers.  So if you have a wow sticker on your car, you might want to look around a little bit.  Look around.  See what's out there.  But do not harass the ladies.  No.  That's not what we're about, okay?  They're doing you a favor.  The other thing, a lot of people go, well, damn, it's whipping my Wednesday.  I need a wow sticker.  You can get one by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York,  New York, 10106.  That address is on the websites, www.nw.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[00:06:30]  But, and we love this.  This is how wow started six seasons ago.  We love the homemade wow sign.  Yep.  Love them.  Just like the one you saw in the back of the garbage truck in the Soprano.  Correct.  It's white paint.  We love when you guys take the masking tape and you put your own wow in your car.  That is fine.  And if you can't get your hands on a sticker, then, yeah, yeah, make your homemade wow sign  and get involved with Whip them out Wednesday.  We love that more than anything. 
[00:07:00]  There's also guys.  The stickers have made it a little too easy because in the past, you know, the radio station  we used to work for, they didn't want to put out the wow sticker.  Oh, no.  We're not endorsing your program or your ideas.  God forbid.  So we had to take it to the next level and it was a grassroots movement where everyone  had to make their homemade wow sign.  Yeah.  We like that to always be a part of Whip them out Wednesday.  And if you're a guy out there and you're pussy whipped and your chick doesn't let you  put a wow sticker on your car, there are other ways around it. 
[00:07:30]  And the homemade thing is the way to go.  A lot of guys I know were taking the bag of wow chips, remember that?  Mm-hmm.  And they take the wrapper and just put it in their back window.  So if the old lady says something, you just go, oh, I was eating some chips.  It's like, I threw it in the back.  Right.  And it landed up taped up on my back window.  Right.  But any wow will work.  So it's kind of like opening day for us.  Opening day for Boo.  Yeah.  I know the Yankees and the Mets started their seasons already, but this is the real season  starting.  Yeah.  This is much more important. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, man.  It doesn't work sometimes.  This button doesn't work.  Play ball!  There it is.  Okay.  Is that Vince?  Yeah.  Who is that?  Play ball!  Oh, I guess not.  Wait, get the, uh, here.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful day for boobs.  So I guess we need someone to throw out the first boob today, Andy.  Throw out the first breast.  Who is going to throw out the first boob?  We need a lady to call and tell us that she's been wowing today. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  Chris, what's going on?  How are you?  All right.  I know your listeners can be quite ruthless.  I was just wondering, if a girl has small boobs, will she get made fun of?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Boobs are great.  Any size.  Yeah, we've learned about this.  Yeah, guys like them in all shapes and sizes.  The best thing about boobs is their variety.  Even the ugly ones.  I mean, you get flashed by an ugly set on the highway, you're taking them back a little  bit, but then about a mile down the road, you're like, hey, that was cool.  Good boobs.  Right.  They were boobs anyway. 
[00:09:00]  That's right.  Great to know.  So are you going to be whipping them out today?  Maybe not today.  All right.  Well, we're not going to force you, so.  Of course not.  When you're ready, you'll unleash them, right?  We'll definitely do.  All right.  Good.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  All right.  Bye.  Weld it on, rivet it on.  We don't care.  We don't care what they look like.  Cowbell Bill in the studio.  Cowbell Bill.  Hey, I haven't heard that tune in a while, huh?  Oh, yeah.  The Bill's version.  That was Bill's wow song that started the, uh...  That's a good song.  We got a brand new song from Steve from FoundryMusic.com we want to play. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And we're encouraging all the, uh, the local bands, you want to get some exposure on a pretty  good radio show, uh, send in your wow songs.  Yeah.  A way to get your name out there, okay?  If they're good, we'll play them.  If they suck, we'll play them and make fun of them.  That's right.  So, uh...  You'll get airplay.  We are looking for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday songs.  You could start that immediately and send them into our, our show, okay?  Yeah.  You want to hear Steve's?  Yeah.  From FoundryMusic.com?  Also, should we even announce where Black Earl's going to be? 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  Hending out the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, uh, stickers today?  It's pretty tough to, to announce where Earl's going to be because he never gets to the,  uh, location.  Hard to find it.  Very treasure.  And he never fills the envelopes.  No.  You never, yeah.  He sends out empty envelopes when people mail in for, uh...  Well, we took that job away from him.  Thank God.  Yeah, we got the interns that are on X doing it now.  But now he's like, I'm somewhere in Manhattan.  Great, thanks, sir.  Aware.  Well, yesterday he was supposed to be at the Staten Island Ferry, and he ended up in the  middle of Washington, uh, Square Park.  That's, that's a great place.  Same thing. 
[00:10:30]  To, to hand out, uh, stickers.  Just as good, right?  Hold on, hold on.  Uh, Jennifer, what's going on?  Hey, I'm on the LIE.  I just did the first row, I'm sure.  Uh, officially you have, uh, thrown out the first boom.  Woo-hoo!  We did it!  Beautiful.  The first first boom!  Woo-hoo!  Yay!  At least they did something today.  What road were you on, Jennifer?  We're on the LIE.  What exit, I mean?  Uh, what exit are we?  Just curious.  We're coming up to the BQA.  We just got out of Manhattan.  And you'll be wowing, uh, every car you see with the wow stickers and the homemade wow 
[00:11:00]  sign?  I'm going to try.  Oh, thank you, Jennifer!  You're very welcome.  Matter of fact, let's give Jennifer something for throwing out the first boom.  Yeah!  Ah, a little prize.  A little prize for helping out the show.  The amount of wow stickers out there, you may as well just leave them out.  Yeah, yeah, just leave them hanging.  Leave them hanging?  Well, I'm looking for, there's a, there's a jersey van in front of me that has a nice wow.  Oh, cool.  Let him have it.  You can look out the window.  Tell that jersey guy to look out his window.  Are you, uh, whipping him out? 
[00:11:30]  What?  Are you whipping him out again?  Well, I'm trying.  If he looks.  He's not looking?  He's not looking.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm telling if they're not looking.  Well, beat the horn or something.  I'm trying.  What's another lane?  Ah.  Ah, he's driving away from me, but bitch.  All right, Jennifer, I'm going to, I'm going to, um, give you a prize.  Hold on a line, okay?  Cool, thanks.  All right.  Jennifer gets something for throwing out the first boob.  Nice.  Melanie from, uh, the Boyer bus.  Melanie!  Hey, guys, what's going on?  What's going on, Melanie? 
[00:12:00]  I gave my first wowed a season.  You did?  And I, and I got wowed back.  Oh, from a chick.  From a chick.  I got bumper stickers all over my car.  A little, uh, lesbian wowing going on.  Ah, that's fine, too.  Girl on girl.  I was going to say, we like girl on girl.  Quite.  Definitely.  It was awesome.  All right, guys, I'll talk to you later.  All right, Melanie.  Bye-bye.  The season has just begun.  Oh, and you think you, you see a lot of wow stickers and signs out there?  Yeah, just wait.  It's going to get really, really interesting.  Because they kind of, uh, they kind of dwindle a little bit in the winter. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Because there's not much wowing going on.  Right.  But spring means boobs.  That's right.  On the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's right.  Also, time to start assaulting the media again.  Yes.  They have let their guards down.  Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of live shots out there unprotected.  They're, they're no longer doing their live shots from the top of the news van.  Right.  We've scared them all.  Mm-hmm.  Above ground.  On higher ground, they had to go.  Yeah.  Now they're back at street level.  They're back at, uh, street level.  It's time to get the, the wow signs on live TV.  Yes. 
[00:13:00]  Great prizes for the people that do that for us.  We've had it.  Remember that last year?  A lot of news guys out there doing the live shot.  Our, uh, lunatic fans running up behind them with the wow signs and various dressers.  Maybe a gorilla suit we saw.  We saw the, uh.  The Gumby outfit.  The Gumby guy.  The Gumby guy was the best last year.  And they come in with the outfit they were wearing on and the wow sign.  Mm-hmm.  And we give them, uh, valuable prizes.  Yeah, very good stuff.  So, uh, who's going to get that going for us?  Yeah, that's another thing.  We haven't talked about that in a while.  No.  We kind of had a little, you know, stop talking about it so the, the news crews would let their guard down. 
[00:13:30]  And, of course, I think the show needs its first wowing of the season.  Right.  If there's any, uh, girls in the area that want to, uh, come up and throw out the first boob here in the studio of the wow season, feel free.  Yeah.  I'm very excited about that one.  Someone has spotted Earl.  Uh, Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I got the, uh, wow van here at the Garden State Plaza.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He made it there?  Wow. 
[00:14:00]  I got it from the Negro.  Oh, very good.  And I just want to let everybody know that Garden State Plaza security means wow.  Oh, you're one of the security guys?  That's right.  Help us out today, all right, Mark?  I'm trying to.  Hey, thank you, buddy.  No problem.  All right, let's, uh, go to Earl, who's now on the phone.  I'm moving you on.  Earl.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We are right in front of Borders here at the Garden State Plaza, ready to hand out wow stickers,  and, uh, the, uh, invitation to wow is also extended here, so in the area, I want to, uh, whip it out. 
[00:14:30]  Earl, are you trying to do shtick?  No.  Chuckle, but catch.  Tony Soprano, so, uh, politically incorrect.  So you're in, uh, Paramus?  We're in Paramus.  Come on, how about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  In the film.  Thank you.  Hey, Richard Pryor wrote that line.  Come on. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  Okay.  No, it's all right.  You know that, Earl, right?  Yes.  Day is never good.  Master got me working.  Sunday master's got me.  Bye.  I love that.

They were the first guys after a while.  We have a security guy right here on the phone.  Let me go to him.  The next man makes a move, the nigga gets it.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's terrible.  You know what?  Thank you.  It's French because that's my favorite movie.  Well, Richard Pryor wrote most of those lines. 
[00:16:30]  I know.  That's what makes it even...  Stay out the bushes!  From experience.  Earl's got something to say.  Earl?  Hey, where are the white women at?  They'll be there, Earl.  Calm down.  Thank God for Blazing Saddle.  Earl?  Yes?  Came over a couple of years.  Fair checker.  Look what I did to you again.  Oh, my God.

Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Earl?  Earl, you hanged out the sticker.  Here's a happy guy that I got one from earlier.  I got it from a negro.  Ah, yes, of course.  So, Earl, no one knows where you are.  What do you know?  We're right in front of a parking garage at Border Book. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah?  I'm Big Jake Black.  Entrance one at the Garden State Plaza.  You don't want to hire any niggas.  That's all.  They're like right off of four.  And you're giving out what?  Four stickers so far?  Actually, a couple of cars are something to pull up now.  Ah, very good.  Good, good, good.  Yeah, good.  Very good.  Shut up.  They're coming out of the woodwork now.  Hey, one of the guys that is pulling up to the van, he's on a cell phone.  Sir, yes?  You can see Earl?  Got herself some pretty little faggot. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, someone else is coming here, and it seems to like Earl.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, chives, wops, or braziers.  Now he seems to like everybody.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I'm going obscure here.  Earl, who's your friend helping you hand out the stickers?  I'm the invisible man.  Oh.  Well, it sounds like you have at least six people there, buddy. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Earl?  Hey, I love you.  Well, flash him.  Show Earl.  I tell you what, she won't do it.  She's not behind the pun.  Yeah, guys.  What?  She says, I'm a little shy.  Hey, I want to give a shout-out to my mother.  Yeah, go ahead.  Let her do that, Earl.  Hey, hold on.  All right, when Earl gets back on the phone, it's finally game.  Hello?  Opie?

Hey, my name is Maria.  Hi, Anthony.  How you doing?  Very well, thank you.  And you'll be wowing this fine wow season?  I mean, this is what my mother wants me to, but I'm a little shy.  Wow.  There's a lie.  My mother does, though.  She really loves it out.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Don't let me comment on that.  I'll talk to you guys later. 
[00:19:30]  There's a lot of people coming up, so cool.  You guys rock.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  All right, so let's get Earl back on the line.

So, it's great.  It happened, guys.  I'm telling you.  You had a sticker on and you saw it. 
[00:23:00]  You wowed him.  Three years the guy's been trying.  It's like fishing.  Some people put the line out.  First minute, there's the fish.  Other people got to wait and wait and wait.  But it happens.  Persevering.  And, Kathy, he was cool to you?  It was cool.  He was like, thanks.  I'm glad it was my first wow, finally.  I'm calling from his trunk.  Yeah, guys, be cool to the ladies.  Don't follow them.  Don't harass them.  Just put the sticker on your car and see what happens, okay?  Well, thank you, Kathy, for helping us out with this.  No problem. 
[00:23:30]  Love you, guys.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Take care.  I knew this was going to happen already.  Neil, what's going on?  Hey, I don't know what you're talking about.  This yard ain't here doesn't have thousands of stickers.  He only has a few stickers.  He's going to run out in a couple minutes.  Earl's going to run out of stickers?  Yeah.  No, come on.  Yeah, we'll call him up and ask him.  How many did he say to him?  You said he had a couple thousand.  Yeah, I'm scared, Chuck.  I don't know how to count.  Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.  Hey, stop.  What's wrong with you?  It's our Earl.  We got rid of him. 
[00:24:00]  Only we can do that.  Bought and paid for him.  Long Island coming through with the wild stuff, huh?  Yeah.  Go for the run out of stickers.  What?  Turn that down.  I had to hang up on the guy.  Yeah, call.  If you're calling in the show, you've got to turn down your radio, please.  Very, very long delay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  O&A.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, ma'am.  Real quick.  Yeah.  I'm calling.  I'm with Verizon.  Just want to let you guys know and remind everybody that the phone company can't put the wow stickers on the truck. 
[00:24:30]  It should be automatic.  Okay?  Just to remind everybody.  Yeah, we made that rule last year.  We actually got the memo that these guys at Verizon had gotten in their mailboxes.  That said they are not to put wows on any of the trucks.  You can be terminated if you put a wow on your Verizon truck.  So we just said Verizon equals wow.  Yeah, we've got to remind everyone of this.  Remember, too, if a lady did you see a cop and he's giving you that wink?  Oh, yeah.  NYPD equals wow. 
[00:25:00]  That's right.  There you go.  If he winks at you.  Yeah.  It's like the secret, like, yeah, I'll accept the wow.  And hope he ain't got something in his eyes.  I got a little duck to my wall.  Yeah.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right.  Let me take it.  We've heard from a few cops that they have their wows, and they kind of casually put it on the side window.  I've seen some cop cars with the wows on them.  Yeah.  Like, really subdued in the lower corner or something.  Put it on the back of the perp's head.  And that way you see the girls see it through the window. 
[00:25:30]  And you're getting wowed.  Ira.  Yeah.  She's been in a fro.  Ira, what's going on?  Yeah, I was going to say Plaza.  I'll tell you, man.  Earl's a big time attitude.  He gave me about ten stickers.  No, what?  Uh-oh.  See, that's the problem.  Let's get Earl on the phone.  I just want to get done quick.  Yeah.  Come back early.  He does that at a lot of these sticker stops.  He goes with 2,000 figures.  I give 100 to 20 people.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  Oh, damn it, Earl. 
[00:26:00]  One to a customer.  Maybe two if they're hot.  Unless you have so many.  All right, Anthony.  We got the first brand-new wow song of the season.  We're encouraging the bands to send in their wow songs.  We'll play the better ones on the radio.  By the way, speaking of people setting in songs, the Offensive Song Contest, too, coming soon to the ONHL.  Oh, Jesus, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, yeah.  The contest that spawned Baby Raper and some of those hits. 
[00:26:30]  I'm Horny for Little Girls.  What was the Camp Concentration?  Camp Concentration.  And, oh, Cash Prize?  Cash Prize this year.  Ah.  Working on a Cash Prize.  Gee, I wonder if Q will send something in.  But that's going to happen.  Of course he will.  We're going to start that up in about two weeks, I believe.  We're also going to start off the Bikini, the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  And I'm here.  We got a great prize for that.  Whipped Cream?  Yeah, what's the, uh, what's the, what's wrong? 
[00:27:00]  Listen, I called Earl.  He's such a moron.  What if a moron goes to a sticker stop and leaves his phone off?  So you want to call Earl and his phone's off.  Hi, you've reached Earl Douglas.  Please make the message down to him.  What were we saying?  Sorry.  And, of course, he's not listening to the station.  Oh, how do you do that?  Listening to jamming.  Oh, man.  It's a Yankee game.  He'll be out of here in a half hour.  I handed out all the stickers.  On the KFC.  New Year, 250 stickers per person.  New Year, same Earl.  Yeah.  That was a change. 
[00:27:30]  The one constant in the universe.  Ben, do we have a really good prize for the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest?  We're going to start up in about a week and a half?  Price is, I believe.  Price is?  A really good trip, though, right?  Trips, plural.  We have to, trips?  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, I just can't wait until Psycho Mark comes in for that contest and starts doing  whippets out of all the Whipped Cream fans.  You know that, Donnie.  I got no food.  I'm so wasted.  I believe that contest starts in 15 days.  No, no. 
[00:28:00]  Didn't we say the 26th?  He's trying to do a milk contest.  Yeah.  Why don't any of the Whipped Cream fans like, I don't know where I am.  I'm on the KFC.  Back, back, back.  I'm on Mars.  I feel like I'm surrounded by Beavis.  And I say, hi, you.  I'm floating.  And my hands fell off.  Milk pouring out of the can.  Looks like a night of drinking kamikazes.  Why?  Ouch.  Now, when's the date that it starts? 
[00:28:30]  It's that Monday.  Yeah.  I don't think that's the 26th, because today's the 11th.  23rd.  20...  20...  23rd.  Monday, April 23rd.  That whole week, the ladies will come down and get into their whipped cream bikinis.  Oh, yes.  For valuable, valuable prizes.  It's going to be great, okay?  Bravo.  Let's go to Joanne.  Joanne, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  So, I just wowed the van.  You just wowed everyone down there to stick us up? 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  Bravo.  Bravo.  We went around again, and they said, come on again.  I hope someone had a digital camera so they could send it to the station.  That was cool last year.  Last year, we were getting all these wowed pictures that were being emailed to us as it was happening.  Yeah, it was nice.  Oh, really?  From the various sticker stops.  Yeah.  I'm hoping somebody has a digital camera.  I'll perish the thought Earl had one.  I'll tell you, it's my first time getting a sticker.  Oh, cool.  I'm going to put it in my car.  Thank you.  A lot of people down at the sticker stop.  A lot of kids.  A lot of kids? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, well, kids like me, too.  We're sitting in our van with our four kids.  Good.  My girlfriend has two, and I have two.  And you're wowing.  Good.  Yes.  Tell me.  My girlfriend's son is three and five, and my daughter's two, and my son is five.  Oh, so they're just off the boob anyway.  Yeah.  Hey, Joanne, hold on.  Jerry Springer's on the other line.  I want to talk to you.  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Jerry Springer.  What a mess.  Believe me.  Yeah, Jerry Springer's on the line.  Jerry Springer.  I'm going to be talking to Jerry Springer now.  Earl.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:30:00]  What's happening?  Earl, why does every call with you have to start with, you?  Oh, I'm going to be talking to you guys.  Earl, why is your phone off?  My phone is on.  Well, now it's on.  We tried to call you.  Now it is.  Yeah, I haven't shut it off.  Are you running out of stickers, Earl?  No, sir.  Earl, are you giving out like 20 stickers at a clip?  No, we're not.  How many?  If a guy says, hey, I need six on my truck, I'll give him six. 
[00:30:30]  If he asks for five, I'll give him five.  What's the most you will give?  The most we will give?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Ten?  Tops?  Wow.  Guilty.  Yeah.  Earl, you're not going to run out of stickers, right?  You've got to be there for a little while.  No, we're not going to run out of stickers.  We haven't even cracked open another box yet.  Oh, look at you.  Okay.  All right.  Yes, Jesse?  Last week, we did the sticker stop at Tesla.  Amorex, yeah.  And I would only want to give out like two or three. 
[00:31:00]  And if people would have some more, I would be like, oh, just give him whatever.  Keep giving him more.  And we didn't have that many.  So Earl likes giving out in bulk.  Yeah.  That way he gets back here to his job quicker.  So he could do even more for any W.  Right, Earl?  Whatever.  Oh, Earl.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  Earl, we deferred you because one of the listeners was, you know, talking bad about you.  He's got one crew, though.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  Oh, right.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:31:30]  All right, Earl.  Very good.  So you're outside Borders in Paramus, right?  Yes.  We're right in front of Borders, but not to be confused with On the Borders, which is right  behind us, but we're right in front of Borders, and we're handing out wild tickets.  Now I am confused.  And I wasn't confused right up until you said, not at this.  And Earl, if they showed up at On the Borders instead of Borders, but it happens to be behind  Borders, isn't that close enough?  Yeah.  Can they see you from there?  Can they see you from On the Borders? 
[00:32:00]  That's too funny, though.  Can they, Earl?  Earl?  Earl?  We're right in front of Borders, though.  All right.  This poor son of a bitch.  God damn.  And some mall over there?  Garden?  That's right in front of the garage.  Parking garage.  At the Garden?  Garden State Plaza in beautiful Perrin.  All right, Earl.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Stay out the bushes!  Definitely not wearing underwear. 
[00:32:30]  Bob, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just thought it was pretty funny.  You're kicking off loud today.  I'm driving down the expressway.  Uh-huh.  Rest stop right before 52 on the expressway.  You've got people pulled over and putting WOW on the back of their truck.  Imagine that.  Yeah, watch the S-word.  But they're pulling over and putting WOW on?  Yeah, it's pretty funny, man.  I don't have my WOW sticker on this car.  I'm pissed.  No, we encourage...  No, don't be pissed.  If you don't have a WOW sticker, just make a homemade WOW.  Do it out of anything.  We love the homemade WOW.  Yep.  You got any...  Make us proud. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, all you need is dust on your car.  That's it.  And a finger.  And a finger.  I just thought it was pretty funny, guys.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Oh, do that again.  All right.  Ben's pissed at our intern, Jesse.  He's, like, pissed at him every day.  Not really pissed.  I find you get annoyed with him very quickly.  You get annoyed.  I called him a music star the other night because he just...  Well, Jesse thinks he's hip.  He comes in with the latest clothes and stuff.  And so today I asked him if he was... 
[00:33:30]  I guess visors are in this season.  He's chalkboard hip is what it is.  Yeah.  If it's out there and it's been hip for a little bit and it's just commercially being hip, he'll  have it.  Right.  So now I guess the visor thing.  Yeah.  But it's not...  You've got to wear it right.  Yeah.  It's not hip if you just put the visor on.  You've got to tilt it to one side.  Tilt it to one side.  Right, Jess?  Yeah.  You looked in the mirror to make sure your visor was sitting perfectly nice on your head,  right?  Yes.  The Adidas black visor.  Now, Jess, I saw the other day somebody wearing the visor upside down on their head. 
[00:34:00]  That's gay.  A lot of the brothers do that.  Yeah.  I'm the homeboys.  And what are the pants you wearing today?  What do you call them?  The UFOs.  Oh, you've got the UFOs on again?  Yeah.  Are those the same UFOs or you bought new UFOs?  No, these are different.  Let me see.  They've got the straps.  They're very, very baggy.  Me too.  The big pockets.  Jess, I'm going to guess and say in your hair that's not bro cream or dippity doo.  It's Depp.  Depp.  Depp.  Level nine.  Is Depp making a comeback? 
[00:34:30]  Level nine?  Yeah.  Oh.  That means you can stand on it.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah.  Steve T just put a marker on his hair and it just stayed there.  Johnny Depp.  It's Jeff's time.  Johnny Depp.  He was hanging out last night.  Wow.  No, that's cool.  I'm feeling it.  Is that good?  I'm feeling it?  Yes.  Depp.  Depp 69.  You know what a club is called, though, these days, though?  A spot. 
[00:35:00]  A spot.  A spot, yo.  Yeah.  Talking about what?  I asked him if he was upset about the tunnel, you know, Peter Gashen getting rid of the tunnel.  Yeah, it's a big story today.  It's on the front page of the Post.  The guy that looks like John Lennon, he wants out of the business, right?  Because a 16-year-old was killed outside of the tunnel.  He had it, right?  He had it.  I said, I like, I don't like the, I hate the tunnel, but it's a good spot.  A good spot.  And I like the tunnel.  He was getting up on the lingo.  All right.  Getting the lingo up.  So why don't you like the tunnel?  Because it's shady. 
[00:35:30]  Everyone that goes there is shady.  Isn't that good?  Don't you want that?  It's like an underground nightlife kind of thing.  It's got to be shady or it isn't legit.  I think we'll go to Chuck E. Cheese.  I would go with girls and, like, guys would just molest them.  Well, I don't know, right?  Well, why aren't you molesting them?  Slim and shady.  That's my point.  That's my point.  I'm just waiting for the baby to come in looking like Eminem, man.  That'll never happen.  Yeah, you're going to dye that hair blonde.  No, I won't.  So it's shady.  You don't like that.  Yeah.  Anything else? 
[00:36:00]  Don't you need a little shade in your spot?  I think a shady spot's cool.  I like that when I'm, you know, picnicking or something.  You always look for the shady spot.  Right.  Put some depth in your hair.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's going on, dude?  What's up?  Yo, I cannot stand Jesse, man.  Yo, let me tell you something about this kid, man.  Sorry.  All right, we had to dump out.  He says all this stuff like, oh, I'm straight edge this, I'm straight edge that.  Kids like him, those raver kids, man, they don't even know what straight edge is.  They don't know where it started.  Well, let's get it.  Okay, retard, because I don't go to shows, too, right? 
[00:36:30]  Because you know me so well.  Let's start with Jesse a chance.  What is the definition of straight edge?  Justin.  Everybody, like, has their own definition.  He's making an X with his arm.  He comes in behind and making an X.  You want me to explain an X?  Yeah, what does he know about?  Yeah, what's the X?  Wait, hold on.  No, start with straight edge.  All right, straight edge?  It has to do with being straight edge.  Okay.  Okay, this is something we can't possibly understand.  So being straight, like, everybody has their own definition.  Yeah.  But it's mainly you don't do any drugs or drink any alcohol, smoke cigarettes. 
[00:37:00]  I can barely hear him, man.  Hold on.  All right, let me speak up for you.  No, no, I didn't have the button down.  All right.  So you don't do the drugs or the alcohol.  But then a lot of people go psycho with it, and they're vegan also, and they won't have sex.  That has nothing to do with straight edge, buddy.  So I'm like a figure eight.  That's what you said.  I just said there has nothing to do with it.  No, but your whole, do you even know where it started, man?  You're like, oh, I'm straight. 
[00:37:30]  Dude, you dirty razors all the same in the UFO pants, dude.  What's your problem with a straight edge attitude?  Dude, because people claim it, and they don't know what it's really about.  Yes, they do.  And you do.  Yes, I do.  And what is it as far as you're concerned?  Well, actually, does he even know where it started?  Yes, I do.  It started back in the 70s with the hard question.  Such as?  Such as kids would go to shows, and since they were underage, they weren't allowed to drink.  So they would get exes put on their hands, and because they were underage,  so that they wouldn't be allowed to buy alcohol. 
[00:38:00]  And then the kids just started, like, embracing it, the fact that they weren't allowed to,  because a lot of the kids in the hardcore scene were drunk, so they went the opposite way.  Are you either involved in the hardcore scene?  Dude, this is 70s folklore.  Bill, have you ever heard of this back in the 70s?  I really don't remember.  By the way, I was too drunk.  By the way, Anthony, you said Age of Empires a while ago.  I play it every day, all night now.  Yes, see, it's a dick.  Yes, look, see what you've done to me.  But, Anthony, getting back to Jesse, I think he knows what he's talking about, 
[00:38:30]  because his visor sits just right on his head.  Oh, the visor sits just right on his head with his UFO pants.  Yeah.  You see, that's like a mall rat.  Like a mall rat.  He's a mall rat.  Are you saying he's a poser?  I believe I am.  All right, thank you, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Let's go to Ursula.  Ursula.  Hi.  Hi, Ursula.  Um, straight-edge people suck.  They suck.  Drugs are fat.  Their rights are fat.  Straight-edge people suck.  Fat.  So the ravers hate the straight-edge peeps? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, there's not many straight-edge kids that go to parties.  No?  Let's just get punched in there.  Well, but even if they don't do drugs and they go to parties, they don't go preaching  to people how they shouldn't smoke and how they shouldn't do drugs.  Do you do that?  No, not at all.  Would you hook up with a chick if she was like...  Yes.  The girl I was with or with now, whatever.  A lot of dope and booze and...  It's all right.  She does her thing every month.  There's nothing wrong with getting messed up.  You know?  Isolate that.  Jesus, that's a promo. 
[00:39:30]  Exactly.  That's fine.  That's your choice.  It's not mine.  So I don't preach it.  You do it.  No, that's fine.  And you know what?  Like, more power to you that, like, you can do that.  But you know what?  I hate people who go around preaching.  Like, I used to go to a lot of parties.  I used to go to a lot of raves.  And I knew people that were straight-edge.  But they'd go preaching to people, like, why are you doing this?  Why are you doing that?  Like, mind your own business.  Do your own thing.  When we were growing up, they were called nerds.  Yeah.  Yeah, now there's a cool name for it.  Straight-edge.  I called them geeks, nerds, pushies.  The straight-edge I found in Woodshop when I had to make a line on a piece of lumber. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  The only straight-edge I knew of.  All right, Ursula.  Okay, bye, guys.  Thanks for the words of wisdom today.  No problem.  All right.  Let's go to Hector.  Hector, what's going on?  This guy is a fruit.  Get him off.  Why is he a fruit?  This guy is a fruit.  This guy is just flat-out weird.  Where did you get him from?  He is weird, yes.  Just because he doesn't drink or do dope or anything?  Yeah, he's weird.  Everyone does dope in some time of their lives.  Come on.  It's normal.  I agree with you there.  It sounds upbringing.  You've got to get it out of the way when you're young. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  You build up a tolerance for it when you get older.  Exactly.  You will drink at some point.  Dude, first time caller, long time listener.  You guys kick ass.  Thank you.  Hey, why did you make a conscious decision to just not drink or do any dope?  I just never interested in it.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  You don't know what you're missing.  Drugs and booze are so cool, kids.  I see people like hammered, and it just doesn't.  Well, there's a happy medium somewhere in there. 
[00:41:00]  I can't stand when you go to a bar and you see people just falling down drunk.  I'm not willing to take that risk.  You think you have an addictive personality?  Exactly.  And if you just start doing a little drink or something, here's the new game.  Let's get them a beer.  We got it together.  Dude, I was going to go get them a beer.  Like a shot of beer.  Have you ever had any alcohol?  Yeah.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  What was that?  Like a sip of, you know, when you're a kid and you're like,  Mom, can I have a sip of beer?  Yeah.  And I spit it out because it tastes horrible.  Really?  Yeah.  That was part of it, too. 
[00:41:30]  I don't want to have to build up the tolerance of something that I don't like to taste like.  That was part of it.  Yeah.  You see, when I was a kid and my baby teeth were coming in,  my mother used to give me Jack Daniels.  Yeah.  My mom did the same thing.  Whiskey.  Booze was baby medicine back then.  My mom did that so we would go to sleep.  We would annoy.  My pop would be like backyard barbecue.  We have the pool and all his friends are over.  And he used to hate when we'd annoy him.  Like, oh, let me have a sip of beer, a sip of beer, a sip of beer.  He'd crack open a big can of Schaefer and those old steel cans of the big football lace seam down the side 
[00:42:00]  and give it to the kids.  Here you go.  Drink up, kids.  Just so we'd leave him alone.  You know, then we'd pass out somewhere.  It was great.  Not my family.  No, huh?  Well, let's get out of it, Louis.  Louis.  Hey, dudes.  Real intellectual conversation going on here.  Jesse can teach you guys what straight edge means,  and you two old geezers can teach him what 23 skidoo means.  23 skidoo. 
[00:42:30]  I think there's a few years there.  Just one other thing, guys.  I smell fish.  I smell fish.  Yeah, we're going to show you us the whole cabit and caboodle.  Great.  You know something, though?  You're getting to an age where you can't start drinking,  because then you'll just be effed up, like, really bad.  Because I didn't start early.  Right.  Why is that?  Because then all of a sudden you're not going to know how to deal with it.  And as, like, if you start drinking younger, you know, you do stupid stuff, 
[00:43:00]  but it's okay because you're a dopey kid.  Right.  Now you get older and you're drinking and do stupid stuff.  Now it's like, dude, what are you doing?  You're an ass.  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What are these?  I hate it.  I can't stand the damn glow sticks.  What is it that glow stick thing, Jesse?  Could you explain that thing to me?  It's just, um, I agree with you.  Okay, thank you.  Because I wanted to shove those things right up, you know, right up your noses.  The little glow sticks and the opi, they put them in their mouths and stuff, too.  Yeah, and now the kids go, they bring them to concerts now, though, too. 
[00:43:30]  Like, they'll go to a show and there'll be kids with glow sticks at, like,  I went to Pantera and there were kids with glow sticks at a Pantera show.  Oh, Steve, you know what we used to bring to shows?  What are you doing?  M80.  You lobbed those over the crowd.  Hope it went off before it hit the crowd.  Oh, remember watching the fuse running going, oh, no, it's coming down.  You had to time it perfectly.  General admissions getting out.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, I have a question for Jesse. 
[00:44:00]  What nationality are you?  Because you're obviously not Irish.  Actually, I am half Irish, actually.  Wow.  You're a disgrace.  That's a disgrace to your people.  That's what I can say.  That is not the kind of thing I have.  Okay.  The other half.  Mormon.  Matt.  Yeah.  Hey, over there.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, you can't be straight-edged and not be gay.  It's impossible.  Why is that?  How is that possible?  Because I go to raves and parties all the time,  and the only people that I know that are straight-edged are gay. 
[00:44:30]  Talk with the list.  Walk around with just guys.  Gay.  Get out more.  Get out more.  But I get out all the time.  This is a good one.  How many straight-edged kids does it take to drink a six-pack?  One, if none of his friends are around.  There you go.  I'm a closet junkie.  All right, Jim.  I wait until the show's already hammered.  That's where your beers go after the show.  I wonder sometimes.  Fridge empties really quick.  So you will not see Jesse at the tunnel.  No. 
[00:45:00]  Or anywhere.  Or the line light.  What's up with the line light?  You go there?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  I get in free on Saturday.  Why is that?  Because you're straight-ed?  I don't want to the promoter.  Oh, God!  I guess that's in there, kid.  I'm not sure.  So you go there, and there's the regulars, and everyone knows you.  It's like, what's in the cheers?  I'm not.  Not that much.  No, huh?  Because it's mostly, like, a hip-hop party.  Oh, yeah, really? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I haven't been there in so long.  Of course.  I haven't been there since the Fiji's were popular.  Jay, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Well, all I've got to say is that just because you're straight-ed doesn't mean that you preach.  Right.  That's what we said before.  Jay?  Yeah.  That's what you had, huh?  Yeah, no, it's not just that.  It's that everybody thinks that just because you're straight-ed that you go around, 
[00:46:00]  and you're beating down on a bunch of kids that aren't straight-ed,  and you're going to shows and preaching about you don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't have sex.  It's not like that at all.  What it is is that I do this for me.  Straight-ed kids do it for them.  I live with, I have two roommates that both smoke weed, both party, and they do their thing, I do mine.  All right.  There you have it.  Thank you, Jay.  No problem, man.  Peace.  And I'm being told dealers put glow sticks in their mouth that shows dumbass.  Oh, sorry, I didn't know that. 
[00:46:30]  Is it true?  What did he say?  Dealers?  Like, you're dealing?  They put the little...  You put the glow stick in your mouth, and people know to come to you?  I guess.  He doesn't know because you've traded.  Well, thanks, Jesse.  I'm not dealing drugs tonight.  All right, Jess, that was great.  I just sat down for a minute.  He was getting comfortable on the mic.  Sorry.  All right, later.  Later.  That was good stuff.  That's cool.  That ought to get you like an A in class, right?  Yeah.  Anthony, we've got to take a break, but we've got Igor on the hotline.  Igor?  Yes. 
[00:47:00]  Who's Igor?  Igor is the Russian guy that beat the crap out of Tony's sister on The Sopranos.  With the fake leg.  That's our Sopranos guest today.  All right.  We get one every day.  I'll run with it.  You're going to run with it?  I'll run with it.  Sure.  Tony, him, whatever.  Igor.  Igor, hello.  What's that?  What are you doing, guys?  Do you speak like that normally, Igor?  No, no, I don't.  But you know what?  For you guys, it is a while. 
[00:47:30]  And the Vip and Mouth Wednesday.  What the hell not, huh?  I think you did a lot better job of punching faces in.  You didn't talk much on the show, did you?  Well, I had maybe five lines.  Yeah, what were your lines again?  My lines was, get over here.  You give me a leg and Mother Rock.  What did you say?  Bam, I slapped her in the face.  Slapped her in the face with the fake leg.  Beat her up a little bit.  Yes.  And you're famous for that now, I guess.  Well, you know, I have big fundraisers tonight.  Are you in any other episodes? 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  Actually, this Sunday coming up, I have big, big scenes.  You do?  Yeah.  Can you maybe tell us a little bit about what you're going to be doing in that scene?  Well, in the scene, I will be driving a cab.  And that's all I can say.  You really are going to be driving a cab, or you're just trying to make a joke?  No, I really am.  And then, do you beat anyone up?  No.  But you never know.  Maybe I will.  Do you run someone over?  No.  Do you poke someone over your eyes?  I just want to say Opie and Anthony.  I'm a big fan. 
[00:48:30]  I'm listening since Dreamweaver, since old phone, since when Opie was beating up phone  with a stick.  Thank you so much, Igor.  Remember the time I was listening?  I used to deliver the pharmaceutical.  Very good.  Thank you, Igor.  The pharmaceutical.  But listen, tonight, I'm going to be at Vanderbilt.  I'm going to be a fundraiser for prostate screening awareness.  Oh, you're doing that too, huh?  Yes.  All right.  And I also do stand-up comedy.  Oh, you do, do you?  I am very good friends with Gorilla Boy, Jeff Morty. 
[00:49:00]  Ah.  The more fave.  Yes.  There you go.  And you beat people up on TV, and he beats people up in real life.  Yes.  That's nice.  It's a funny story.  Very good, Igor.  Well, give us a little bit.  Give us a little joke.  Of what I'm doing tonight?  No, like your act.  Yeah, my act.  What I'm doing tonight.  Yeah, give us something from your act.  Yeah, we're waiting for your comedy.  Okay.  So, you know, it is like when people go like Italian people, you know?  And I go to the store, and I want to buy food. 
[00:49:30]  And I go, well, let me get fried calamari and mozzarella sticks.  And Italian people go, no, no, this is not fried calamari.  It is galamar.  It is not mozzarella.  It is mozzarella.  Change my order.  Let me get spaghetti and meatballs and macaroni with cheese.  Be more funny.  You see, that is all last-minute things.  Igor, is Yakov Smirnoff your hero? 
[00:50:00]  Well, no.  What a country.  What a country.  What a country.  What?  What, Igor?  What?  I broke out of character.  Oh.  What a country.  But I would love to, you know, I'm also performing this Saturday at Cousins.  At Cousins?  Cousins, too, and it's 160 Conflict in Brooklyn.  Check up.  Setting a course for a star-based, well, I can't believe you're giving the address out to your  relative.  Yes. 
[00:50:30]  Well, look, listen.  O.P. Anthony, right?  Yeah.  Maybe, you know, one day I can come down to the studio.  We can mingle.  We can jingle.  You can come by and say hi anytime.  Anyone that's on The Sopranos is a friend of ours.  That's right.  Maybe tomorrow or Friday is good for you?  Yeah, why not?  Come on.  Whenever, man.  Friday?  Come on by Friday.  We'll have naked bartenders again.  Hey, naked cheeks, my favorite.  All right, Igor, we're going to let you go.  All right, thank you very much.  Bye-bye, Igor.  Igor will be at the Vanderbilt on Long Island tonight for a fundraiser, for the prostate screening 
[00:51:00]  fundraiser.  Jesus Christ.  What happened?  What happened?  You know something?  The first Sopranos guest we ever had was Meadow.  I mean, pretty high-profile character on the show, and she was cute, and she still is cute.  And it was kind of cool having her on.  Then where did we go?  Then we went straight downhill to the rapist.  I think to the rapist.  That was it.  We had a huge gap in there.  Then we had the rapist.  All right, we got a little better yesterday on the phone.  We had Artie, the restaurant owner. 
[00:51:30]  Today we have the Russian guy that punched Tony's sister.  I hear he has to sign, like, fake legs now and stuff.  Wherever he goes.  Wherever he goes.  Signs fake legs.  Anthony?  Yeah.  We have someone else from the Sopranos checking in next.  We do.  Yes, we do.  Who is this?  You'll have to wait and see.  All the news you need to know and booms.  This is W.O.W., the WOW radio station.  W.N.E.W. 
[00:52:00]  1027.  W.N.E.W.  It's the Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  John and Fez at noon.  Kobe and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  It's the Radio Chick.  China has confirmed that they will release the air crew that they've been choosing hostage.  But I think it was because Jesse Jackson announced that he was going to know all of their hair.  People thought, because of my concerns with vagina, I wanted to take a trip to China.  The Radio Chick, weekdays, 9 to noon, 1027. 
[00:52:30]  W.N.E.W.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027.  W.N.E.W.  New York.  It's Whippermount Wednesday on the O&A show.  I'm very excited.  The wow season is back upon us.  Yeah.  We'll give you some more details in a little bit, but too much is going on on the show today.  We've got Cowbell Bill in the studio. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks.  We're going to talk to Moose Moran in a second.  Yes.  We'll explain Moose Moran in just a bit.  Also, I want Cream Cup.  Yeah?  To hold on the line.  Cream Cup?  Yeah.  You're calling the show.  Why?  Because I am the best phone sex person ever.  Oh, I am?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to talk to you in a minute, okay?  Okay, baby.  Hold on the line.  Are you a black lady?  No, I'm not.  I sound like a black lady.  Well, you used the word baby.  Yeah, the baby.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The baby. 
[00:53:30]  Are you fat?  Absolutely not.  Oh, God.  You do have a great voice.  All right.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Yes, you're welcome.  Bill's topic has been honed out a little.  That's what it sounds like.  The red.  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  All right.  Hey, I was just wondering if we could have a little countdown for Timothy McVeigh's death.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Timothy is dying in a month.  What, May 16th, I think?  I think it's, yeah, 16th on the 19th.  And it'll be great.  I mean, everybody's like putting them down and, you know, my father, you know, he works 
[00:54:00]  for the federal building downtown Manhattan and I hate your father, you know, and I'm kind  glad that he did this, you know, and my father's constantly pissed, you know, pissed, pissed  and talking about.  You're glad what?  I'm pissed at my dad, you know.  You're glad McVeigh did what he did?  Well, to the offices, not to the people that were in there.  Oh, to the building.  To the building.  Oh, if he just would have blown up just the building, it would have been okay.  Right.  Dude, people.  That's right.  You know, I'm not even going to argue with him. 
[00:54:30]  I peel guys like that off my balloon out at the racquetball for a few hours.  Jesus, man.  You hear what they're doing with Timothy McVeigh, though?  Closed circuit for 250 people to check out his death?  Yeah.  And there's a huge argument.  Should they do that?  Of course they should.  Should they do the closed circuit, you know?  But here's the deal.  He killed so many people that the witness room of this place that they're executing him in  isn't big enough to hold all the people, the relatives of all the people that he killed. 
[00:55:00]  They said, what, there's eight spaces or something normally?  Yeah, because usually it's just one person getting killed, and you get their family in there.  Right.  This, there's just hundreds of family members.  So they want to do closed circuit.  They want to rent out of, like, a VA hall or something.  Yeah, come on.  And one of the fears is that if they do the closed circuit thing, the tape's going to get out there.  Now, is it necessarily going to be taped?  Closed circuit just means closed circuit.  They can put the cameras on, have the TV screens. 
[00:55:30]  I have no doubt in my mind if they have a closed circuit of this, and there's no tape running,  there still will be some type of tape that gets out.  You think someone will do it?  Somehow, someway, yes.  Tap into a line?  Yeah, they'll do something.  Well, that would rock.  You know, all the...  A little lethal injection is kind of boring to watch here.  I was going to say, all the victim families, they want to watch this, and, you know, they're going to be very disappointed.  No, look, he went to sleep.  Wake him up so we can kill him.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Wow, wow, that was pretty peaceful.  Bring back old Sparky, like they used to call it.  Right.  Old Sparky.  Yeah.  Or hanging.  They think they're going to get some closure.  No, you're going to see a guy just go to sleep peacefully.  Yeah.  That's it.  You're going to go, what?  That's it?  We're too nice.  We are much too nice as a country.  It's like the old days where they just courted them.  Yeah, do one of those William Wallace things on them or something, you know, or you just disembowel them.  A little Braveheart action.  Yeah.  But then there was a hook.  You know, I was watching Geraldo last night, and they were arguing the death penalty and stuff. 
[00:56:30]  There was some see on TV with Geraldo last night, a comb, saying that she doesn't believe that Timothy McVeigh should be put to death.  Doesn't believe in the death penalty.  I think we can all agree that this is probably a time and an instance where the death penalty is a very good thing.  There are times where you have to put your beliefs aside and just realize it's the thing to do.  Yeah.  Massive baby killer, and you're going to try to, you know, argue that the death penalty is not a good thing. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  You've got to be insane.  I don't care if you're for the death penalty, against it, but sometimes we have to meet in the middle and understand, no, this has got to happen.  In this instance, it has to happen.  I'm distracted.  Okay, I'm sorry, because I see a girl in the window right behind us.  Rick, could you check that out?  You see her?  Yeah, but it's in the kitchen.  That's not a bathroom?  No.  That's the middle.  All right, what's she making?  Yeah, you stir that sauce, you bitch. 
[00:57:30]  You stir that sauce, you bitch.  How do we go from the death penalty to a girl?  Because I saw a girl.  That's a big place.  Yeah, you eat, you fat bitch.  San T-Mino.  Yeah, that's a fat lady with gray hair.  Yeah, you eat, you old fat bitch.  Sorry.  Hey, here's the bad part about alerting everybody to a scene movement in one of the windows.  Me, that, no.  You've got, like, a winter coat on.  I saw, if you come here, you see shoulder-length blonde hair, period. 
[00:58:00]  I can't see anything else.  You're insane.  Dude, come here.  I'm only four feet in front of you.  Come here.  I got glare from the cart machines right on that window.  I saw blonde hair.  I alerted you.  I didn't say, ooh, naked chick, ooh, hot chick.  I said human being.  I see a human.  That ain't a fur coat.  Oh, she's naked.  See, never again.  Good.  Screw you guys.  Okay.  I didn't say hot chick.  I said I see movement in a window. 
[00:58:30]  It could have been a sniper.  I'm saving your life.  And look at Steve trying to get footage of it.  Steve.  What are you?  He's sick, Em.  Sorry.  He's got one of those moomoo's with no underwear on.  Keep that camera ready.  Kim, what's going on?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You are so wrong about that McVeigh thing.  He doesn't go to sleep peacefully.  Why?  He convulses, man.  His chest arcs up.  And he pukes.  And he just convulses back and forth.  No, no, no.  That guy, man.  Read the papers when they did all these lethal injections down in Texas. 
[00:59:00]  Call Bush.  I saw a guy walk in.  Nothing happened.  Nothing happened.  He flips out.  He arcs up, and then that's it.  Oh, wow.  He's heaving and everything.  It's not people.  So after all he did, you get to see him arc up once and then go to sleep.  Oh, I want to see him go just as much as anybody else.  Dude, it's a frigging sedative they give him first.  That's the first thing that goes in.  And then they give you something that stops your breathing, and that's it.  It doesn't.  There's no.  There's no.  It's not like they're putting acid in his bloodstream, which is a good idea.  But Opie's got it like he just closes his eyes, says night, night, and that's it. 
[00:59:30]  That's not the thing.  It is.  Compare it to the.  Hey, look, let's try it with you.  Compare it to the.  Come on, strap you down.  Let's do what we've got to do and see if it really works, and then we'll know we're wrong if we're wrong.  Well, Timmy, you're really funny.  When can I listen to you?  Hey, look, not a problem, buddy.  All right.  That is not the case.  You should give him like half a dose.  Basically what we're saying, compare it to the electric chair.  Half a dose is what?  Half a dose?  He's sitting in limbo for a while.  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm not dead yet.  It sucks.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good. 
[01:00:00]  Listen, I was listening to you guys before, and about 75% of the case is lethal injection.  The body goes into all kinds of horrible convulsions.  These guys are going to get a great show if they're lucky.  I don't buy it.  I don't buy it.  No, no, it is true.  What do you call it?  One of the last guys to die by lethal injection a bunch of years ago, I think in South Carolina,  I'm remembering for some reason, they actually had to revive him, bring it, stabilize him,  and then put the stuff back into him again because it was going to be considered cruel and unusual punishment. 
[01:00:30]  Right, right.  And they let him go, and when he got home, his girlfriend had some peanut butter out,  and her dog was licking the peanut butter.  Get out of here.  No, it's absolutely true.  I mean, hey, look, I want this guy.  I like the old sparky thing myself.  Hang him.  Did you read The Green Mile?  Yeah, of course.  Read it.  Why read it?  It was a movie.  Oh, it was a movie.  I read the book.  I saw the movie.  Sorry.  When they put the thing on the guy's head without dunking the sponge in the salt water. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  Really gave a good show.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm hoping this guy, I don't know.  I hope they get an earthquake in that building when they decide to, they can the needle in this junk or something.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  It's a new point because we're a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  We don't even kill people right.  Why even argue the fact?  Dave is headed.  Legal injection is where it's at these days.  Nothing's going to change.  Wouldn't you love to see the mob of angry relatives and the person just, like, get kicked and punched to death, like Mussolini out on the street with the crazy look on the people's faces? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God, kill him!  Kill him!  And he's dead.  And they're just dismembering him with their feet.  God damn, that's the way to go.  Don't hit him.  We're living in the wrong century.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  We are.  We really are.  I love the air travel part, but this execution stuff rocks.  It's a good ass-kicking.  I like my computer games like anyone, but, you know. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  We're missing out on some good stonings.  We'll take the plays of the computer games.  John, what's up?  We'll have to play A.D. Empire if you look out the window.  You should try to make it a pay-per-view.  Or the rock.  That's a funny line.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Yeah, good.  You should make it a pay-per-view with the proceeds going to the families of the victims  that were killed in the bombing.  And it'll be the biggest selling pay-per-view in history.  You know, I don't even know why we're talking about this.  There's never going to be a pay-per-view. 
[01:02:30]  It'll never be on regular TV.  The best we can hope for is closed circuit and the tape gets out.  Hey, guys, real quick.  Yeah.  How's Bill doing after he got hit in the face with that beer at the road show?  Remember that?  They were throwing beers.  They were throwing beers at Q Fart's Pete because he was out there disgusting the crowd  and being a drunk, belligerent guy.  That he is.  We love him for it.  And he faked throwing crap out into the crowd, but it was actually a rolled-up brownie.  So the crowd's getting all freaked out, starts throwing stuff at Q Fart's Pete. 
[01:03:00]  Well, there's a habiel behind the drums, and a beer comes and hits him right in the bridge  of the nose.  It was funny.  Your brother was like, Bill, I was trying to save you, bro, but it was like I was in slow  motion.  You shouldn't feel so bad.  I got hit in the face with a T-shirt.  It's still by zero all over myself.  I didn't even get to keep the T-shirt.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Danny, what's going on? 
[01:03:30]  What's up, R&A?  Hey.  Listen, I got a great George Carlin segue if you want to hear it.  I got it right away about lethal injection.  Yeah, hit it.  All right.  Hopefully he doesn't curse.  In prison, before they give you a lethal injection, they swap your arms with alcohol.  It's true.  It's true.  It's true.  Well, we don't want you to get an infection. 
[01:04:00]  If you can see that point, you wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and be sick.  There you go.  He's a bad.  Thank you.  One of the highlights of this show when we got to talk to him live in the studio.  Are you ever going to have him back on?  We would love him on.  He's in New York, and he said he would stop by again.  We'll see.  He is the absolutely smartest man in comedy.  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Speaking of comedy, we got Christopher Titus.  Yes.  He's going to come in in a few minutes here.  From the Fox show Titus. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  Are we going to talk to Moose Moran?  Casey Keech.  Actually, he's going to call back because he was on a cell phone, but he was getting close  to home, and he didn't want to lose out.  How did he sound?  He sounded like a big top 40 guy.  Radio guy?  Can't wait.  Moose Moran.  Of course, we spoke with his GM yesterday.  Yeah.  Over there in Washington, where the plane is based, where the airmen are being held in  China.  Their plane is based there, so they have this whole grassroots thing going on, and they've  been playing tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree every hour until the men are 
[01:05:00]  released.  Men and women are released.  Well, that didn't last too long.  No, thank God.  Thank God.  I just want to know, was Tony Orlando supposed to be on the show this morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He just snuck it in, didn't he?  It's a great story from yesterday, and we'll talk to Moose Moran next.  You know what happened?  I bet why the airmen got released.  George Bush said, look, you've got to let him go.  We've got to do anything, because Tony Orlando's coming out of hiding, and how many times are  we going to have to listen to a tie a yellow ribbon? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, a tie a yellow ribbon?  Oh, okay.  We read the ghost.  We didn't even take that song.  It's awful.  All right.  Cool.  You want to talk to, we've got another star of The Sopranos on the line, Anthony.  We do.  Yeah, you want to do a quick interview with that?  Okay.  But first, Cream Cup?  Yeah?  We're going to get to you next, okay?  Are you really?  Yeah.  No, I swear.  Okay.  You're going to be the highlight of the show.  You do the best phone sex in the world, right?  I do. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Hold on for just a few more minutes.  Can I mention, hello?  Yeah.  Where I do it, or is that like not allowed?  Well, wait until you do it, and then we'll give you a...  I'm not going to do it on the phone.  Well, you're going to give us a little...  Give us a little tape.  You're going to give us a little tape.  Okay.  You know, you clean it up for the radio.  You give us a little tape.  If it's really good, then yes, you can promote whatever the hell you want.  Well, it's not...  Okay, it's personal.  All right, okay.  All right?  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Cream Cup.  Yeah.  I smell a little trouble. 
[01:06:30]  See how that pans out.  All right, someone from The Sopranos checking in, Anthony.  All right.  We've had some of the really great guests.  The Russian guy that punched someone.  Well, no, it went from Meadow Soprano.  Yeah.  To The Rapist.  The Rapist.  To Artie, the restaurant owner.  And today we had the Russian mob guy that beat up Tony's sister with the fake legs.  Where's Tony?  Why don't we get Tony?  It's getting better, Anthony.  All right.  I want to get Tony on the show.  All right.  Who's this from The Sopranos?  Oh, it's Big Pussy's wife's poodle, Anthony. 
[01:07:00]  Big Pussy's wife's poodle on the phone.  Yeah, see how excited she's getting?  Hey, we were a little concerned for your safety.  Wait, last week.  Shut up for a second so we can ask you.  Okay, good.  We were concerned for your safety last week when Tony came over and broke your owner's window on the car.  We thought Tony was going to cave your little puppy head in with his baseball bat. 
[01:07:30]  What do you think?  Yeah.  You hear that?  Yeah, yeah.  That's an exclusive for our show.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  We've asked everyone this question, but hopefully we got something out of you.  What happens in upcoming episodes?  Give us somebody.  Who gets whacked?  What?  He does?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[01:08:00]  No way.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  That's a scoop right there.  Well, thank you.  We got more out of you than any of the other cats.  Yeah.  Of The Sopranos, so there you have it, Anthony.  Big Pussy's wife's poodle.  Poodle.  From The Sopranos.  Sanked.  Christopher Titus will follow that up next from Titus.  He's so glad he's here today.  Get ready.  Are you ready?  Ooh. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  We're going to be with Anthony.  We're going to be with Anthony.  N-E-W.  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  We're going to get along just fine.  The ONA Show, 212-757-1027.  In the studio, Christopher Titus.  Yeah.  From Titus on Fox, of course.  How you guys doing? 
[01:09:00]  He's already cracking us up during the commercial, so having fun.  I think we can hang.  Christopher, we got a girl on the line.  Uh-huh.  We're going to get to you and your problems in a minute here.  This isn't even on right now, I like it.  Huh?  This isn't even on right now.  No, it's not.  It's the only funny off mic.  All right.  We'll make believe you're off mic in a little bit.  Okay.  Well, we have this lady on the line, Cream Cup.  All right.  She claims to do the best phone sex in the world.  I know you're a big star and stuff, but, I mean, we can't pass up on it.  You go, man.  You've got to go with it, right?  I know it's important. 
[01:09:30]  You need a guy that's worth 16 years.  You need a woman that talks about booty on the phone.  Yeah.  Talks about your vagina.  Move on.  Let's go.  Let's get to what's really important.  Come on, people.  Cream Cup.  How are you?  Cream Cup.  Is that your birth name?  No, it's not.  Cream Cup.  She's a cream cup.  So how long have you been doing the phone sex?  I've been doing it now about eight months.  Eight months?  Yeah.  Sounds like an amateur to me.  Come on, show us what you got.  It's not an open mic, baby.  I am definitely not an amateur.  How do you get that voice like that? 
[01:10:00]  What do you mean?  That, like, scratchy cigarettes off.  I've never smoked a day in my life.  Corrugated cucumbers.  And then you beat the real weird guys that punch you in the esophagus.  That's not nice.  No.  I wish that it's not.  Were you born?  Were you born with a voice like that or what?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Wah.  Wah.  Were you born with a voice like that?  Come on.  He's very, he's not a good boy.  That's the best. 
[01:10:30]  Look what you can do to that rattle.  Oh, God.  How old are you born?  Come on, man.  I am not retracting anything I said.  I thought Rick would have written that one down.  Over the top Rick.  So, uh, you're making a big claim there, uh, Cream Crop.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's a fact.  We like giving out honors on this show, but you've got to prove yourself again.  Well, like I said, I can't really prove it on the air, obviously.  Is anyone paying for phone checks anymore?  I remember a few years back, it was all you saw on the back of the pornos, whether you ask for the 900 numbers, and on TV you'd see them. 
[01:11:00]  And, uh, I remember I was on job sites where I wouldn't have to actually pay for it, and I'd go into the job trailer, and, uh, you know, punch in the numbers, look out, see if the super's around, and, uh, listen to the girls talking about all kinds of fun stuff.  But I don't even see that happening.  With the internet and stuff, now you don't even have to pay for it, do you?  Do you?  I mean, you have to pay for it, and it's worth it.  It's worth it.  It's so good that phone checks make it a comeback. 
[01:11:30]  Exactly.  How about you have, uh, phone sex with, uh, Christopher types?  Right.  Hey, whoa.  You know, my wife is pregnant.  Go ahead.  He's got his neck.  Well, come on, bring it on.  Yeah.  What do you want?  I mean, I'm not going to, what am I going to do right now?  Nothing.  All right, please talk.  You were talking pretty big a couple of minutes ago.  Yeah.  I mean, I have no doubt, if one of you wants to call me privately, you can report back and let everyone know.  That's not good enough.  What do you mean?  Hey, Opie, did I tell you?  You can't call me privately. 
[01:12:00]  Well, that's going in there in a minute.  Exactly.  We're promoting you here, lady.  I'm going to call up and claim I'm a fighter pilot.  I'm not going to show you my skills.  Right.  But I'm here to the best.  All right, how about it?  I didn't say that to anybody.  Get Stinky in here.  Stinky will do this.  Why?  Go ahead.  We got a delete button, the pause button.  So go ahead.  Go ahead.  Why?  Stinky.  I want you to have phone checks with Cream Cup.  There you go.  Stinky and Cream Cup.  I think it's in this sitcom on Fox.  Tide after Tide.  Stinky and Cream Cup. 
[01:12:30]  In about ten minutes, we want this studio to look like the living room scene from Turner  and Hooch.  Now, that would be a good phone sex show.  We don't have a job trailer.  When phone sex goes bad, I'm Fox.  I'm Fox.  Stinky, sit down and get into this, okay?  Here's my guest.  I am definitely not going to do that without all you guys watching him.  We're not watching.  He's in another studio.  He's in an isolated boat.  You are going to have to do some huge stuff to pull out of this that you're in, because 
[01:13:00]  I'll tell you, right now, as far as the phone sex thing goes, you suck.  Come on, girl.  There you go.  Nice.  Someone's got a button.  Welcome to this morning zoo.  It's a nice one.  Cream Cup.  Stinky and Cream Cup in the morning.  Wake up with Stinky and Cream Cup.  And the morning zoo.  Hello, Quack. 
[01:13:30]  There you go.  Hold on.  Let me go to the joke service station.  Stinky and Cream Cup.  Let me sum through this.  This guy's done some radio.  All right.  Come on, Cream Cup.  Come on, Cream Cup.  You can do a little something.  You're by yourself at your abode, right?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Are you naked or anything?  What do you look like?  I'm 5'4".  Yeah.  I have long, wavy brown hair.  I weigh 117 pounds.  Oh, I thought that was going to be a 7B. 
[01:14:00]  38 double D.  Hello, boy.  Flat stomach.  Yeah.  Small, tight bubble butt.  Bubble butt.  All right.  Oh, wait a minute.  My stomach's a 38 double D and my chest is flat.  And I'm wearing, right now, I'm wearing, it's like a Victoria's Secret day.  It's silk black panties and a bikini bra, which is a joke on my...  It's a joke on your cans.  And the eye hides on my thing.  Well, get into it with Stinky, all right?  We've got a big star in the studio, right?  Yeah, come on.  You're making us look bad. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, where is Stinky?  Right here, cream cup.  What is he wearing?  Wearing a tight white T-shirt and some slacks.  You know, not too much.  Well, take off your T-shirt.  Oh, hold on.  Oh, he's doing it.  Okay.  And I lick your thumb.  My thumb?  Yeah.  Okay.  And make your nipples hard for me. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that's odd.  Okay.  They're nice and hard for you.  You want me to take my top off for you?  Oh, that'd be great.  Okay.  I'd like to do something.  I'm not sure if I can do it on the air.  Well, just, uh, clean it up.  Clean cup.  Clean it.  What do you want to use?  How do you clean up licking yourself?  Well, you use, uh, code words.  How about if you, well, I could just do it and you can hear it. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Don't describe it.  Just do it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Just stirring a drink.  Or a hamster sucking one of a little bungee bottles.  A little water bottle.  Are you not thinking?  Oh, yeah.  Like the old cream cup.  Oh.  Sounds hot. 
[01:16:00]  Well, I'm getting hot just talking to you now.  Is your shirt really off?  It really is.  Unfortunately.  Pull your jeans down.  Oh.  All right.  Go in the distance.  No, they don't have to believe.  We're on the radio.  Do you want grease or boxes?  You don't want to know.  I want to know.  Tell them she's in boxes.  Ew.  What color? 
[01:16:30]  This, uh, red and blue.  They got a big S on the front, which I find weird.  Well, if you take your boxes off, I'll take my pennies off.  Oh.  Come on.  We're in here with them.  Hey, I don't care.  Oh.  Yes, y'all.  All right.  I'm turning away.  All right.  There we go.  We got to turn away.  I'm free flying.  How big?  You know, nine, eight, nine. 
[01:17:00]  Come on.  It's hung like a gym teacher's whistle.  Is it thick?  It looks like a 7-Up pad.  And oddly enough, the same color.  What have you been eating?  I have a big red dot on the side, too.  I'm going to take my pennies off.  Thank God.  Thank God.  I kind of suck at this. 
[01:17:30]  You're actually doing a pretty good job talking to six guys on the radio messing with all the  time.  You don't have a lot of guys cracking off on phone sacks.  She's going, hey, you're doing any thing right now with a 7-Up can, huh?  You're actually doing pretty good.  That's not distracting.  So are your panties off?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I don't think I can set it here.  That's the house.  Well, yeah.  What do you have down in your pants?  How are you groomed?  Let's just say it's a mohawk. 
[01:18:00]  A mohawk?  It's a mohawk?  Turned down.  How big is your bunt?  The phone's ringing.  You want to answer that, cream cup?  It's a paying call.  Goodbye.  Cream cup?  Yeah?  How big is your bunt?  You know what a bunt is?  No.  It's the combination belly and the other word.  It's like the awning.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  We're ready to listen to you.  Go ahead.  Give us all you've got now.  I'm just kind of trying to pace myself here.  Don't pace yourself.  That's right.  We call that dead air.  You call it pace.  All right.  Well, don't pace yourself.  Jack up the phone.  Let's hear what it sounds like when you're really, really into what you're doing.  But don't describe what you're doing.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Let it rip.  Okay. 
[01:19:00]  Here we go.  We've got the dog back from the Sopranos.  There we go.  We've got a bunch of guys nodding.  Nice shot at a basketball game.  All right.  We'll get the dog back from the Sopranos.  Oh, my.  We're right. 
[01:19:30]  I can't see that.  I don't see the skin as well.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Well, look at that.  Cream top.  Very nice.  Nice.  I'm sorry.  I got to try it.  Sounded like the last scene of Looking for Mr. Goodboy, didn't it?  I got to say, I didn't like the opening piece, but the closure was pretty nice.  And as long as you have a strong closure.  There you go.  Get off strong.  That's what they always say is a comment.  You got off strong.  Very nice.  Cream top steak, what do you think? 
[01:20:00]  It was all right.  Sounded more like cream corn.  Oh, gee.  Oh, man.  And Ziggy, would you put your pants back on?  Yeah, please.  Thank you.  All right, cream cup.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  We're not going to give you the title, Best Phone Sex Operator.  No, we can't.  Okay.  I mean, you did a good job.  Thanks.  Maybe someone will beat you.  Hey, tinge.  Nudge, nudge.  All right.  You want to get a plug in for something?  Yeah.  Want to do some plug in?  Well, wait a minute.  Was she good enough to plug them? 
[01:20:30]  Huh?  Was she good enough to do a plug?  You know, I got to say this.  You know, my wife is great.  I was a comic on the road, so I used to call my wife all the time.  And my wife, my wife's pretty good.  You know, not, you know, cream cup, you know, you're all right.  But my wife's a little bit better than you.  Oh, you did?  You did the phone sex.  Man, I was on the road 40 weeks a year.  I did what you asked me to do.  You did?  No, you did a good job.  No, I think we would all say she did a fine job.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought she was happy with you.  I actually believe that, you know, did you think she could plug something?  Go ahead.  I think, all right, give a plug. 
[01:21:00]  www.fm.com.  That's cream cup.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  There you go.  That was a great plug.  No one listening, don't call my wife.  Thank you.  You're a filthy whore.  Oh, my God.  Bad timing.  Oh, my goodness.  Hey, honey, I know if you're listening at the hotel, please.  Cream cup?  Yeah?  Someone's saying they didn't get their pen in time, so could you give us that plug one 
[01:21:30]  more time?  www.fm.com.  Hey, Wang, it's a parking lot.  Wait, slash cream cup, I believe?  Slash C-R-E-A-M-C-U-P.  The aunt's making jokes.  One more time, please.  Sorry.  www.fm.com.  How many times is she going to fall for this?  How many times, people? 
[01:22:00]  Cream cup.  That gag never gets old.  Turn the bleach and all of a sudden.  Norton.  Hey, well, she keeps saying it over and over.  All right, cream cup.  She can't get it out, Norton.  Mr. Manicotti can get it out.  I was on the phone.  55 minutes, nothing.  Cream cup?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You rock.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:22:30]  There she goes.  Oh, you know, it's odd that a woman that does sex on the phone would let herself be humiliated  like that.  Isn't it just odd?  That's a horrible one.  That's a gig, though.  By the way, that just cost the radio station about $400.  Yeah.  Somehow she was able to reverse charge.  Okay.  Steve's got an observation.  Steve, what's up?  Yo, boys, there's no way you're going to convince me that she ain't every bit of 225 hanging  over there.  That was just a private, Tony, over the edge of the line. 
[01:23:00]  As far as a friend of mine owns a phone sex company.  I set up his office furniture.  Now, a normal cubicle is like three feet for a phone cubicle.  He made them full, and I was wondering why, because I said, you know, I could fit more  cubicles in.  He said, well, you've got to see the women that work here.  Seventy-four are the fattest black chicks you ever saw in your life.  Really?  Doing the phone sex?  Yeah.  And it specializes in fetish.  Like, you know, the freaks.  Isn't that great?  Cubicles.  When they sit there and go, I'm on my silk sheet.  Wonderful. 
[01:23:30]  You're in a cubicle.  They're sitting there stuffing another piece of chicken in their face.  And, you know, I'm trying to convince you that it's all okay, you know?  All right.  You guys have a good one, pal.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, we interrupted Christopher Titus for that.  I know.  Not at all.  I tried to contribute where I could, people.  And you're playing Carolines tonight?  Carolines tonight.  Tomorrow she shows tomorrow on my show tonight.  I'm in town doing a lot.  I'm whoring my show right now.  Are you doing that?  Now I'm whoring for Carolines.  Hey, come on down.  What's wrong with that?  The show tonight, it's at 8 at Carolines, and tomorrow, 8 and 10. 
[01:24:00]  Call Carolines for Ticket Info, right?  Mm-hmm.  We're going to be doing Norman Rockwell is Bleeding the show that the TV show is based on about  Mike Screwed Up.  As you'll get the real stuff, you'll get my mom.  My mom shot and killed her last husband.  Yeah, you have a story.  Now, I want to get into some of the show.  I watched the show.  Right.  And it's effed up in a funny way.  There you go.  I mean, Stacey Keach is hysterical as your father.  If he doesn't get an Emmy, I swear to God, I'm doing a truck with C4 and I'm driving  at the Emmy headquarters next year.  He is a twisted son of a bitch on the show. 
[01:24:30]  Very funny.  Yeah, he's amazing.  The guy who's actually been to it all, he's like my dad in the lake, you know, he got plus  of a Coke, all this stuff.  Yeah, I don't know.  He lived really hard, so he really is my dad.  Remember his old show, Kareeb?  Kareeb?  He was on a show called Kareeb.  He played some Caribbean-based investigator guy.  Yeah.  Did he make his face?  He saw it all the time.  I actually, you know, Fox always has me to be a comic.  I, you know, I'm still a comic, but I write stuff for the television critics.  And I wrote this thing about Tom Shale that he better get on it and really go after us. 
[01:25:00]  I mean, he imitated Oz totally, black and white, black, black, black.  And Tom, he missed the whole thing.  And this dude, I don't know who it was, got up and walked out of the television critics  of some chance.  So, no, we didn't get canceled, man.  They got picked up for next year, too.  There you have it.  Okay.  Yeah, but it sucks.  That's the truth.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, tighty.  What's up?  I just wanted to call in and compliment you guys on your show last night.  That was a really funny show last night.  Yeah, we electrocuted a 15-year-old girl, huh?  Hey, did you see that on CBS, touched by an angel in my ass? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, the guy who plays your father in that show, didn't he play in Cheech and Sean movie,  man?  Yes, yes, of course.  He was Officer Stodanko.  Yes, Stodanko.  You know, Stacey did Shakespeare in the Park.  He was like, this is amazing.  He had Hamlet and stuff.  I came here.  And now you're like, dude, you're in Cheech and Sean.  You know, I have miles and killer clowns from outer space.  Did you learn that?  Yeah, those are the things that follow you.  Nothing great.  Yeah, what else have you done that you don't want to say? 
[01:26:00]  I was on 21 Jump Street.  I played the worst character on 21 Jump Street, the worst bully.  You were?  Oh, I was.  I beat up DeLuise, man.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I love when they rerun these things.  You go, hey, that's the guy.  That's the guy.  That's when he was desperate and needed rape money.  Hey, it's Fark.  You can pop the name in the Internet Movie Database now.  It's like 20 movies that everybody knows they want to forget.  No, I get off.  Gone to the Internet.  We need to take a break.  We're hanging with Christopher Titus, of course, from Titus on Fox. 
[01:26:30]  He's going to be at Caroline's tonight, one show at 8.  Two shows tomorrow, 8 and 10.  Call Caroline's for Ticket Info.  We'll be back.  What's about Wednesday?  Oh, man.  One day at the door.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, I think Easter is this Sunday.  Yes.  It is.  Vermont Teddy Bear.  Ah.  Vermont Teddy Bear.

[01:29:30]  We're hanging with Christopher Titus.  Playing Caroline tonight at 8 o'clock.  Two shows tomorrow night.  Christopher, do you mind if we check in with our buddy Earl?  Let's check with our buddy Earl at traffic.  No, it's not traffic.  We don't do traffic here.  There's a weather guy.  Come on.  Bring it in.  We got a front coming in.  Christopher has done a lot of radio.  He's been waiting too much.  Obviously.  He's expecting the wacky radio here, right?  Us to break in. 
[01:30:00]  Let's go to our I Am The Sky traffic reporter.  Same damn traffic every day.  We don't do traffic.  It's the same every day.  People know that.  I Am The Sky traffic reporter, Earl.  Guy can't drive a van.  Never mind if he's got a helicopter.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday today, Christopher.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yeah, girls like flash on the highways and stuff.  Are you kidding me?  No.  So we're making fun of the radio that you guys are doing.  Yeah.  All right.  Whip Em Out Wednesday, ladies.  Show us your time.  But it redeems itself because it's... 
[01:30:30]  It's edgy.  It's edgy.  It's canned.  It's boobs.  It's boobs.  That's white.  Guys love boobs.  Yeah.  Earl.  Yeah, what's up?  What are you doing?  We're here at the Garden State Plaza.  We're in Lot 14 by Borders Book.  It's been a great crowd here in New Jersey.  Love you.  Hey, Earl.  Earl, have you ever seen Titus?  Yes.  And?  Joe Rocks.  Oh, that's good.  I think you're putting all that energy behind you.  I always pull the energy all the time.  Joe Rocks.  That's as exciting as they all get. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm so sleepy.  That's about it.  Thanks, man.  You're going to leave soon or what?  Yeah, we're going to be leaving shortly.  We've had a great crowd here.  It's been a nice steady stream, blocking traffic a little bit.  Yeah.  And at Wild Spakers, it's been a great, great stop.  All right.  So you're basically calling us to tell us that you're leaving.  What?  Hey, where are the white women at?  I really do.  Oh, man. 
[01:31:30]  Why are you calling us to tell us that the promotion is over and you're leaving?  You beat me.  Oh, no.  He's down for the count.  I've passed it on my stickers and I'm going home.  Where's the white flag?  Earl?  Earl?  You're better men than me.  What's wrong, Earl?  You all right?  Yeah, we're fine.  We had a minor problem, but...  Oh, it was a minor problem.  The cops made us move.  Yeah?  Were the Whip It Out Wednesday thing, was it working?  We got out three times by a couple of passers-by. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  There were a couple of idiots harassing the ladies, but that's been taken care of.  Really?  Women that were flashing their breasts, they were harassing them?  My God!  For God's sake, they're classy women.  What is going on with this world?  Come on.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God!  Oh, you didn't know.  Oh, my God!  Hey, Richard, I know what that line.  Blazing saddle.  That's right.  So, how about it, Earl?  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, man.  Ouch.  That's just frightening. 
[01:32:30]  I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm sorry, Christopher.  Wait.  Why is the white man keeping me down?  See?  Earl, I'm with you.  Earl?  Yo.  Oh, man.  You hit me on the head with a shovel.  You know, my grandfather, actually, my grandmother beat the crap out of slim pickings.  He used to hang out with my grandfather.  Really?  My grandmother beat the crap out of slim pickings with a broom up on the Sacramento.  What'd he do?  Came home drunk with my grandfather at three in the morning.  Grandma came out whipping in a whaling.  Walking out of a whaling.  Whipping in a whaling. 
[01:33:00]  Whaling in.  She beat the crap out of slim pickings in a walnut orchard.  And that's my wacky story.  Who's this crazy woman with a broom?  Jesus, man.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets you.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  He's going on.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  That's horrible, Earl.  So, Earl, you're leaving.  We're going to be here about another ten minutes, and then we're out of here. 
[01:33:30]  You put in a good two hours today, it looks like.  Yeah, pretty close to that.  Breaking down those stereotypes.  Thank you.  Of course.  Earl.  Yo.  You like the Sopranos?  Yes, I do.  You like Tony Soprano?  Yeah, he's one of my favorite characters.  You're a good soul.  Oh, man.  The moving yarn. 
[01:34:00]  Tony.  Terrible.  Earl, I apologize.  That's Tony, of course.  I'm actually getting really uncomfortable.  Isn't it really mad now?  My California miss is starting to creep in now, and I want to stand up for somebody, damn it.  See?  This is wrong.  Same over a couple of minutes.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am now leaving the studio.  I'm going to March for Freedom right now.  I think Christopher Tide is out of here. 
[01:34:30]  You've already found another guest.  Earl, I apologize.  Me and you against the world, man.  All right, Earl.  That's how it feels I've done.  Stay strong.  Do you need to give out the address again, or?  Lot 14, Garden State Plaza.  We're right by Board of Books.  Save the drama for your mama and push.  All right.  Don't give up your seat, Earl.  Boy, that birthing class is rough.  All right, Earl.  All right, you guys.  You're the man.  See you in a bit.  All right.  There he goes.  Earl's, uh...  Earl, almost done. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  He's the guy you guys just rip on, pretty much.  No, I mean, he's that guy.  He's that guy.  Boy, you're too quick for us.  I'm all over it.  Come on.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Listen, if you want to really get tight, it's a little kind of gross out there.  Why don't you show him a little bit of century sex?  Oh, what is this?  What are we doing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we got a porno movie.  I'm already so nervous, I got Australia under each armpit.  What the hell's going on?  Come on.  We got this porno movie.  It's called Century Sex. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  It's this woman that's 100 years old, giving BJs and getting nailed by some guy.  And it looks like E.T.  Her body looks exactly like E.T.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  I'm going to hang.  You need to...  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Wah!  We could set up a screen.  We could set up a screen.  Oh, it's in my nose.  Wah!  Okay, no.  I want to see it.  I'm really...  Oh!  I'm sure it's really...  Ah! 
[01:36:00]  Okay, now I'm ready.  Let's go.  We could set up a screening in the other studio.  Everyone that's seen it has just thought it's the most heinous, horrendous thing.  It's really odd.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's strange.  But you got...  It's one of those things that, like, you got to look...  You got to...  You got to...  You got to...  You got to...  You got to...  You got to...  You got to watch it.  It's like a canister.  You just got to stick your tongue in there.  What?  Who said that?  Who's the kangasaur on?  Oh, man.  What the F?  Wow, Bill.  Really? 
[01:36:30]  It's jumping in.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  Wow.  So, uh, you guys watch it.  You guys watch it, like, and talk about it on the radio?  Yeah.  We usually send people out of bed into the other room and make them watch it.  I've been good.  We played it at one of our road shows in front of 1,500 people.  And?  Oh, the collective.  It's got a great...  Good.  Amazing.  Amazing sound.  1,500 people in dead silence.  Yeah.  I want to go home.  Oh.  Do you drink anymore or anything?  I don't drink. 
[01:37:00]  I drink because I, uh, well, I used to drink hard, but then I drank until I was 17.  Yeah, that's it?  Yeah.  At 17, that was it?  I quit drinking at 17 because it's not good for your health, and I fell into a bonfire.  Yeah, you're done drinking, and you don't need a...  Falling into a bonfire is a one-step program.  If so, if anything convinced me to stop drinking, it was my drunk friends trying to stomp me out.  Hey, man, are you all right?  Get his hair!  Yeah.  We were just talking about setting yourself on fire.  I did.  I fell right into a bonfire.  And my friends, yeah, and then after I fell in the bonfire, my buddy, like, throws me off the fire, 
[01:37:30]  and then the entire...  He's at a beach party in high school, like the last day of the junior year,  and, like, everybody gathers around because there's steam coming up off me, and I'm in the event now.  And they all know I need medical attention, but it's way too early to end the festivity.  Right, right.  And he's like, Tony!  Get him a cold beer for each hand!  It's like a drunk triage at this point.  You know, if you've got to send him out, it's over.  The party's over.  They take me, they leave me, they put a blanket over me and leave me there on the beach,  and then during the night, I was getting up and putting my hands in a nice cold sand because they were burning.  They fell in like a push-up, and then I went up and put them in a nice cold salt water. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, not good.  Yeah, that was really not good.  No, I'm drunk and stupid.  You should have got some leads.  Well, six in the morning, that's great.  That's great.  That's okay.  I've got Martin Stewart with me.  What were you when I was burnt on fire?  None.  They take me to the hospital next morning, this emergency center, and it's like an emergency  shed.  There was a doctor, a weed whacker, and a rake.  And they take me to my friends.  They don't want to get busted, so we go in.  They walk me to the door and they go, hey, dude, man, look, we talked about it, and here's  what happened. 
[01:38:30]  You're a homeless guy, and we found you on the beach.  I am a 17-year-old, burned-up, homeless boy with new Nikes and an alligator shirt.  Got it.  That's why I stopped drinking.  Wow.  That's early, though.  Those funny stories and more tonight at Caroline.  Eight o'clock.  Two shows tomorrow with Christopher Taitis.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's just early to stop drinking.  I want to hear it.  My dad was good at it.  My dad could drink it.  My dad, we have no pictures of my father who's not holding beer.  Weddings, funerals, parents, teacher, conference, and he was on.  He could drink anything.  He used to warm me up a shot of 100-boot whiskey and never got sick as a kid. 
[01:39:00]  Really?  Never got sick that I can remember.  What about the drugs?  Drugs.  He grew pot.  I mean, my dad grew pot in the backyard.  At least that's what I told the judge.  My dad.  No, we really did because he was friends with the police and the firemen.  And we literally had pot plants a foot higher than our fence.  Because my dad dressed like a lawyer.  He was a salesman.  Yeah.  I had an uncle that did that.  Yeah.  Right next to sort of a cop.  We lived in East Isabel on Long Island.  And he told my mother, because he was this health nut, that he was growing a basal-oregano hybrid. 
[01:39:30]  And my mother bought it.  Knocked you on your ass.  Yeah.  But he needed half the yard to grow this.  Like he's supplying all the East Coast.  He's getting to Columbia.  Yeah.  Basal-oregano hybrid.  And then my father, you know, came around.  He ventured around every few months or so.  And came in the backyard and goes, what's this pot?  And she's like, no, you a-hole. 
[01:40:00]  It's basal-oregano hybrid.  Don't you know anything?  It's basal-oregano hybrid.  It was when my dad grew the worst homegrown shake on the planet.  Homegrown shake.  He was like a pound at school for like five bucks.  You guys know.  You've got to smoke it all, though.  You get a bunch of smoke it all.  And I did that for like three weeks.  He smoked pot for like three weeks.  My dad had like hefty bags in the attic above the thing.  And it was just, it was wrong.  That's right.  And it was great when I used to go over and see Joe.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe, you know, 15, 16, whatever.  Hey, Joe, what's up? 
[01:40:30]  You got anything?  Just open his window, reach out, pluck a bud.  Yeah.  Plucking a bud off of the tree and then drying it in the oven.  Yeah.  Until he forgot one day that he had put it in his showstone.  He's drying more because he needs more.  He forgot.  And he used to have to do this when my mother was at work.  He forgot, fell asleep.  It started on fire in the oven and a big pile of pot.  The whole house reeked.  I was like, it was like Hell's Angels headquarters.  It smelled like. 
[01:41:00]  And my mother came home and he's like, dude, you've got to help me.  Mom, she's pulling in the driveway.  How am I going to help now?  Open the window.  Do it now.  The oregano basil.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm fine.  We got off.  What's your deal?  And I'm sleeping.  I'm doing black.  Excellent.  I just ordered 800 pies.  Sprinkle in a little basil-oregano hybrid.  Hey, Flex is checking in, Anthony.  Flex from the joint, I remember, right?  Northern State Prison.  What's he doing?  Yes.  We have a lot of prisons.  Look at the face.  Oh, really?  Well, I was just thinking of letters I get from prison. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, Flex, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  You got that prison phone.  Great prison connection.  I love it.  Yes.  What's going on today in the joint?  Well, same old, same old, same old.  Putting a party open.  Same old, same old.  Just never happens, bitch.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You want to say hi to Titus, Christopher Titus?  Yeah.  See, exactly.  Did you get to watch TV in the joint?  You don't get to Fox in the joint?  Oh, no.  We get TV in.  Yeah.  For the Titus show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I really don't watch that, though. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  You couldn't fake it like we're all doing.  What do you watch?  You can even give me a little bit.  Hey, nice show.  Move on.  Smackdown.  What do you watch?  Smackdown.  Smackdown.  Yeah.  And it's big.  That's big.  I'm not talking about what you see out in the compound.  Oh, Smackdown.  Thank you.  I have one of those.  Discovery Channel is very good for you, too.  Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  Yeah, and educating.  All right.  So, what do you want to say today?  Because we've got...  Well, you heard about that thing in Bergen County, right? 
[01:42:30]  No, that thing.  So, Michelle walked in charge of like $500,000, not $500,000 for a badge?  For a badge?  Like a cop badge?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, what kind of lunatics are they?  These are people that are supposed to be watching us or arresting us, but these are the ones who  are the criminals.  Yeah.  A cop was selling his badge?  They were selling badges.  Right.  $5,000.  For $5,000.  For $5,000. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And he paid it for real cops.  All right.  To become a sheriff officer for Sheriff Cacone.  In the Bergen County jail.  Yeah.  And who?  What?  All right, Flex.  I was just in the newspaper a couple days ago.  All right.  And what do you want to say about that?  Those are the criminals right there.  Right.  The criminals are selling cop badges $5,000.  Again, yes, those are criminals.  Indeed.  Okay.  Thank you, Flex.  We've got to get back to Christopher Cacone.  Remind us, what did you do?  What did I do?  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Looted the police.  You looted the police.  Yes.  You fired some shots at the cops, didn't you?  Right.  Okay.  All right.  But the guy's selling badges of the criminals.  Yeah.  Thanks, Flex.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  Hey, ONA.  Yo.  Listen.  Uh-oh.  The officer here, right?  Right.  His name is Officer Fry.  Yeah.  There's another officer named Palazzo.  Yeah.  He can give me cases of juicing, anything that I want to eat, and bring to me.  Yeah.  So let them know that.  And I respect that.  You coming tomorrow? 
[01:44:00]  We actually would like to say to those officers, thank you for giving the criminals contraband.  Is that what you want?  Contraband.  Isn't that what?  Can they bring you that stuff legally, man?  No, juice.  Juice?  Regular juice or juice?  No, stuff out of the kitchen.  Ah.  Throwing up the trays and stuff like that, making sure we eat very good.  Oh, good for them.  Good.  All right.  All right.  I thought they were slipping you juice, like, under the table or something.  Right.  I didn't know they were giving you juice to eat.  I thought it was a prison slang.  I thought it was just you were the only guy getting juice and hoarding juice against all 
[01:44:30]  the other guys.  Because they're giving everybody juice.  And that's good.  No, this beat is very good.  I'm good.  This beat is good.  All right.  Thank you, Fleck.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Take it.  All right.  Peace.  Peace.  Juice.  Wow.  You know what?  I know I like to get the prisoners and get in their juice.  Isn't that good?  You know, when you kill a guy, you shoot some cops, you need your juice.  I think a lot of crime is gone if you guys didn't have their juice.  Get their juice.  I'm happy.  You've got to have your juice.  And to those officers of keeping those prisoners in juice, thank God to you.  God bless you. 
[01:45:00]  Moose Moran's on the line.  Oh, we've got to talk to Moose Moran.  Could someone pick up Moose Moran and tell him we're going to get someone in a minute so we could...  Tell him any time.  All right.  They picked him up.  Yeah, any time.  Oh, good.  Moose Moran.  Now you can't hear us.  Moose Moran.  Goofy, wacky DJ.  Is he really?  Yeah.  You're kidding me.  Is this the guy that was playing Ty Yellow Ribbon?  Yeah, Ty Yellow Ribbon.  He's in Washington.  Does he know you guys?  Is he all right now?  He can't hear us.  He can't hear us.  Okay.  So does he know you guys are making fun of us?  No.  No.  He thinks they're one of the people because they've got national coverage. 
[01:45:30]  As a matter of fact, CBS News just had them on.  He basically thinks...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He basically thinks we care.  Yeah.  Maybe a little silent thing?  Maybe to end it.  But I just love the inside of the wacky, goofy radio.  This guy was an afternoon jock over here at this station in Washington where the aircraft  is based.  And he was too wacky for afternoons.  So as GM, the general manager, told us when we talked to him yesterday, we said, what did  he do that was so wacky that you had to put him in mornings?  He goes, well, he puts on, sometimes when he broadcasts, this big moose hat with antlers 
[01:46:00]  on it.  Right there.  I'm like, whew.  You've got to move him in the morning.  People were driving into Bridge Abundance.  You're driving.  You're tired.  You can't.  You guys are that wacky.  What are you going to do?  You can't do that.  He would do the moose thing, though, too.  And if you didn't have his hat with him, he would put his hands up to the side of his  head with your thumbs at your temples and make little moose antlers with his hands,  which I just think now is, it's so wacky that I don't even think mornings are the right  place for this guy.  We need to invent a new time.  A new whole new time. 
[01:46:30]  A whole new time.  A radio.  So his bit was to play Ty a Yellow Ribbon every hour.  Every hour.  And then the big exciting news came yesterday that this morning on Moose Moran's show,  Tony Orlando himself was coming on the show.  Tony Orlando, who, by the way, loves a good hostage crisis, loves it.  Are you kidding me?  He sells a couple million records.  This guy has got it.  When he picks up that paper, he's Americans held.  He's like, yes, yes.  Cleans up his eggs. 
[01:47:00]  That's right.  Puts down the cocaine for a minute and cashed out on the road.  John, both of you, get out here.  We're going at the dinner.  I got him, man.  You want to talk to Moose Moran, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk to him.  Here we go.  Here's Moose Moran.  Hey, Moose.  Yes.  Moose Moran.  Hello.  You're live in New York City.  Moose Moran.  How you doing, Moose?  How you doing, Moose?  I'm holding myself.  Yo, you know, we've been keeping cabs on what you've been doing out there in Washington. 
[01:47:30]  And I got to say, hats off.  Hats off to Moose Moran.  Or if I could say, wacky Moose hat off for Moose Moran.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you wearing your hat, Moose?  The wife said, do not wear this Moose hat.  You're not wearing the Moose hat.  Can I put a shout out for Renee O'Keefe?  Absolutely.  Who's that?  That's my wife.  She made it all possible.  She wired all the networks and she said, Moose, they're coming to get you.  And the next day, I was hit with three networks just like that. 
[01:48:00]  Three networks.  And she said, don't put that Moose hat on.  Yeah, she did.  But now, Moose, I looked at a tape of what you did on the Fox show, the Fox morning show.  And you gave a little moosey antler wave with your fingers, didn't you?  Yes, I did.  Yes, you did.  Now, what did the wife think of that?  She loved it.  Can you give us one of those little waves?  We'll do a little finger action right here.  There it is.  There you go.  He's doing the Moose thing.  Now, Moose, how many networks have you been on? 
[01:48:30]  I tell you, I've lost track.  I'm still waiting on the animal plants to show up.  I hang out at my morning show and just yell, okay, who's next?  Who wants a piece of me?  And they're all over the place.  Now, is this the most coverage you've ever gotten in your radio career?  The most coverage next to my days, could I mention I went on a weight loss program?  You mentioned whatever you want.  Jenny Craig.  Can I say that on the radio?  You were on a Jenny Craig commercial?  Yes, I was.  But I looked more moose-like.  Really?  How many pounds did you lose? 
[01:49:00]  It was like 30 pounds in six weeks.  And I love the compliments I got from my friends.  Have you kept the weight off, Moose?  Kept the weight off.  Very good.  Bravo, Moose.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Now, Moose, did you have Tony Orlando on this morning?  Tony Orlando called specifically to say thank you.  I thought he was coming in.  Thank you, because I put an additional on.  He called to say thank you, and I talked him into saying a few things on the air.  And he was excited about the people coming home, and I just let him have some air time.  What did he say on your show a lot? 
[01:49:30]  And he did a nice job introducing his song.  Oh, he introduced it?  Yeah, you know, the Ty O'Ribbon song.  Yeah, what did he say?  And now, Ty, yeah, you've heard it a couple of times.  Well, I do the old DJ thing.  Okay, Tony, how about introducing that great song of yours?  And there it can.  Moose, are you sick of hearing that goddamn song?  Yeah, but now I've got to play Celebration for every, on the bottom of the hour, every  hour for the next two weeks.  Oh, man.  Why do you dig these holes for yourself?  Yes.  What are you doing?  Celebration.  Oh, man. 
[01:50:00]  Moose, you know, celebrate this.  Just say the word.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a cool stuff.  I don't know.  That is great.  I heard you talk to ours.  There it is.  We're playing it now, Moose.  Yo, Tony.  Your personal help.  Hey, Moose, do you want to tie a yellow ribbon around your neck at this point?  I heard you wanted to tie one around my general manager's mouth yesterday.  Yeah.  No, he's got that good radio voice.  He did a good job.  He did.  You bumped him from his morning gig over there, huh? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was time for him to leave.  We asked him what you did that was so outrageous in afternoon radio that you had to be moved to  mornings, and he said that you would sometimes wear that wacky Moose hat.  Yeah, and they just wanted me to be in hiding where they wouldn't have to put up for that  all afternoon.  I don't know.  I was hearing good things about the Moose.  Like your ratings were going up, you're looking good, and they put you in mornings.  Well, congratulations.  What's next for the Moose now that the people are coming home?  You basically put a country back to Descon 1. 
[01:51:00]  We are no longer in danger because of you, man.  You played that song enough, people got behind you, and now we've got people coming home.  What are you going to do now?  Well, I'm going to go over to NAS Whidbey Island and play a little party music and probably  play a celebration.  Oh, they're going to DJ for a party at the base.  And see if people can actually dance to tie y'all ribbon around at OLC.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Moose, do you watch Titus on Fox?  Oh, never miss it.  Really?  I'm sorry.  Who was that?  Oh.  No, it's a great program.  Wow.  You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?  But you know what the best program is? 
[01:51:30]  No.  What?  Freaks and Geeks.  You know they canceled that last year.  I know they did.  We're able to keep my wife.  We can't figure it out.  Yeah.  Chris Titus' show is still on.  That's my show.  Yeah.  We have Christopher Titus in the studio here with us.  Hey, he's no Tony Orlando.  No, Tony.  We're doing what we can here, Moose.  We're actually watching a Titus marathon until they recapture the airmen.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Until they take him back.  That's right.  Oh, man.  We have those guys in Cayette, Sweden, the island right now after our men. 
[01:52:00]  We pray that they get home.  Oh, I've got to go pick out a song, then.  Okay.  Well, you don't do that, Moose.  Moose Moran, thank you for coming on our airways here in New York.  Can I say it like the guy says it?  Say it up.  Yeah.  W-N-E-W.  I love that.  That's great stuff.  What guy's that?  Whoever it is, you have me on hold.  That guy.  Moose.  The voice guy.  And I asked your producer if I could say hello to Don.  Don who?  Give you some fodder about Mr. Imus. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, you know Don Imus?  Yeah.  No, go get him.  He's right down the hall.  We broadcast from the same place.  Yeah, because we're all in the same company.  Just tell him, Moose and Renee love the program.  It comes into the Seattle area in Everett, Washington.  Hey, is this Moose Moran?  Just dreadful.  Don Imus here, Moose.  Hi, Don.  What the hell are you subjecting your people to that goddamn song?  You're some kind of jerk. 
[01:53:00]  Now shut up, of course.  Jackass.  Yeah.  Moose Moran.  Idiot.  Idiot, yeah, jerk.  5.30 on the fan.  Quack, quack.  There you go, yo.  Oh, Bernard, you jerk.  Hey, Moose, you couldn't have picked a better song, you jackass.  Is that Brad?  Are you doing the Brad?  Stupid Moose.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moby Worm coming to get Moose Moran.  How's your donkey going, Moose? 
[01:53:30]  Look, I got the Moose hat on.  I took off my cowboy hat.  By the way, can people order the Moose hat on the Internet?  Yeah, we want some Moose good.  We want some Moose swag, man.  Check out the website.  You can really get the Moose hat?  I'll come up with something for you.  All right, man.  I appreciate the airtime back there.  All right, Moose Moran.  Thank you, Moose Moran.  Have fun with all the Moose fodder you came up with.  You tell our guys and gals that we said, welcome home, okay, from Opie and Anthony. 
[01:54:00]  Consider it done.  Thank you, Moose.  Opie and Anthony, you guys are great.  Thanks, Moose.  Thank you, Moose.  Take care.  Moose Moran.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the man is single-handedly.  Rock the two cones.  We're going to be talking to Lenny Clark next.  Lenny Clark.  Yeah.  I've got to go set up over there.  Can I take off?  Yeah, you know, the Moose thing just actually starts to light up.  Yeah, I know.  Moose will do that.  Yeah, I'm a thing.  Moose will do that to you.  But I told her we're all having fun.  No, I've got to go set up my thing.  I've got a show to do.  Where am I doing that show tonight, guys?  Caroline.  Huh?  Come on. 
[01:54:30]  Good day.  Caroline.  But we thought, like, you really liked us.  I'm going to tomorrow's show.  All right, good.  I promise I won't suck.  That's all I can say to the people listening.  I won't suck.  All right.  All right.  That's all we ever do here.  We try.  It's Christopher Tide.  It's playing Caroline's tonight at 8 o'clock.  Two shows tomorrow night.  Eight and 10 o'clock.  You know, when I say this usually, I don't mean it, but this was actually fun.  You've got a good time.  Yeah, no pressure.  I cranked up the jokes, comedy.  Come on, let's go.  Comedy, comedy, comedy.  Come on, funny, man.  Come on.  Come on, funny, man.  We were hoping for, like, one more mom story.  I don't like you. 
[01:55:00]  Just one, you know, one real mom story.  How about a little mom story?  Leave us with a mom story.  Leave you with a mom story.  Mom, let me think of a mom story that I could tell.  I told you about you killing her last husband.  I told you about that.  I told you about the...  She really killed her last husband.  She shot and killed her last husband.  And got acquitted.  She went to trial, got acquitted, and got the guy's $100,000 life insurance policy.  How did that happen?  Yeah, well, because he beat the crap out of him.  And by the way, the funny part of this story is that the guy had actually caught...  The funny part of my mom shooting the guy is that the guy had actually...  The guy had two acres of land, and he was the one that had taken her out and taught her how to shoot. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so there's a tip for you, gentlemen.  If you're going to beat her, don't teach her to fire the weapon.  The funny part of my mom. 
[01:56:00]  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  I love it!  I love it!  So be an answer to me.  The brain is in their head.  1027 WMEW.  In the middle of commercials, but we've got to get Heather on the line real fast.  Heather, what's up?  We're on our way to the med team, and there is not one person with a wow sticker.  Me and my friend Jen were running out. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  You are so ready to wow, but you can't find the wow sticker.  And I'm not exaggerating.  Not one.  Oh, God.  I think that's some big nonsense.  First day, we're all riding nothing.  Then we're going to the med team, so we're, like, in a good mood.  Yeah.  I'll see you then.  I'm very depressed.  All right.  Well, guys, you've got to get the wow in your car.  You've got to get it going.  We're at exit 2.  Heather, do not flash anyone.  Why?  Only flash the cars that have the wow.  Right.  All right?  I'm not going to flash anyone unless it's a cop and he winks at me, right? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You can do that.  Yeah.  All right, Heather.  Thanks.  Go Mets.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Guys, you're crazy.  Get the homemade wow signs on your car until you get a wow sticker.  I'm telling you, it works just as good.  Oh, yeah.  Lenny Clark waiting to get on the show, Anthony.

[01:58:00]  Or just call them up, 1-800-LITELINE, 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Or go to GNC, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Genevieve's, Vitamin Shop, or Vitamin World.  Hi, this is Christopher Titus.  I just finished doing the show, P. and Anthony's show, on 102.7 WNW.  And frankly, I'm a little f***ing pissed off.  We have that effect on people.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  All the big stars on the show today, Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  I know.  Christopher Titus.  We had the Russian mobster from The Sopranos that beat up Tony's sister with the fake leg.  Uh-huh.  We had Big Pussy's wife's dog on the show today, the poodle.  Yes, we did, the poodle.  And now to follow all that, the great Lenny Clark.  Hey, Lenny.  Hey, Opie, Anthony, how are you?  How you been?  What's up, Lenny?  Not much, man.  I heard every commercial in America on your show.  What happened to the phones?  Tell me about it. 
[01:59:00]  All right, they're whoring out this program, Lenny.  Ah, well, I tell you, don't pay any attention to these phones.  I'm hanging up on everybody calling here.  Yeah.  I've been waiting to talk to you guys.  I haven't talked to you since you left Boston.  We haven't talked to you in a while.  Oh, no, we saw you at Thomas Come Home, you know.  Oh, yeah, we chatted, but, I mean, I really wanted to talk.  I miss you guys.  You were fantastic here.  You killed the mayor, and then they made you leave.  Yeah.  Have you killed anyone down there?  Have we actually killed anyone?  No, not killed anyone, but we've pissed this mayor off really bad.  Yeah, we got some people arrested, and we need to have some beer soon, Lenny. 
[01:59:30]  It's gotten really good.  I tell you, I'm dying to come down and see you guys.  You know, Adam does the show with you guys.  Yes.  My partner, I love them.  And I can't tell you, you know, man, that New York, that place is great.  I used to go there to perform, but we walked out of our second.  You know, we'd never see the place.  You just, we were like night people.  One big party for you guys.  Yes, it was, but now that we're working, that's a whole different thing.  I love it, Don.  I hear it different, though.  I hear you're down here, even though you're working, you're still, you're still like to have some fun. 
[02:00:00]  Nah, nah, nah.  I'm totally focused now, you know?  You know what Dennis said?  What?  He said you quit all the booze and stuff.  Yeah.  And now you're falling apart.  I am falling apart.  Well, I had to go in and get my heart saps up.  You know, when I start fishing for the show.  Oh, Lenny?  Hello?  What's a heart?  A heart?  It's the thing that keeps the blood pumping.  Oh, a heart.  A heart is hot.  As opposed to a heart on.  Right.  You know what that is, right?  What's the opposite of... 
[02:00:30]  That's Nick Carter.  That's what he is.  Oh, no.  No, it's all right.  I'll say whatever I feel like.  I don't care.  I like you guys.  What's the opposite of cold?  Hot.  Yeah, okay.  And then what pumps in your chest?  Blood.  You're bad.  Ah, that accent's amazing.  He doesn't want to play.  I don't know.  But you know what happened?  They said, can you lose the accent for the show in New York?  And I said, well, let me see the script.  And I said, well, there won't be any car.  There won't be any apartment.  There's not going to be no party.  It's not going to be bizarre.  It simply won't be retarded. 
[02:01:00]  I think we covered it all.  And you don't say wicked.  I don't say wicked.  I don't say pisser.  You're a wicked pisser.  But I say hand release.  Yeah, that was a funny episode.  I'm telling you, man.  Hey, we're digging the job.  We really are.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  That's a really, really good show.  Well written.  And you guys are hilarious.  Well, I tell you, you know what?  I was glad to do your show because you guys are the most listening to people down here in New York.  Aside from the fact I like it.  But tell everyone tonight that West Wing is a repeat. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, why are these people watching something?  The show's not going to change.  It's the same show you saw two months ago.  Give us a break.  Why would you watch that show First Run?  You know, I don't understand.  Oh, look.  My team can keep the pressure.  Oh, Rob Lowe is a good-looking guy.  And they surround him with ugly people to make him look even more attractive.  I don't understand that.  I mean, the chicks in there, I wouldn't bang for practice.  You got that tall, geeky guy who's bigger than me.  Or that chick who thinks, I don't know. 
[02:02:00]  I think she's a man.  And then you got the two-ditch old blondes who I can't tell apart.  And they foam in the basement.  And, you know, it's between that and Survivor.  I don't, I can't, I got TV rage.  I want to kill everybody on TV.  Well, you don't have to compete with the Survivor.  Well, you had to one week, right?  One week.  Yeah.  You know, but that show, I didn't get sucked into this show.  No?  No, no, I'm not watching.  I don't care.  To me, I'll only watch if they let loose wild animals in the island and kill everybody there. 
[02:02:30]  That would be a good Survivor show to me.  Why watch anything else when you could watch Lenny Clark's ass stuck in one of those police  scooter things with cops trying to pull him out?  That was classic.  Yeah, geez, you know, that's something I don't want to have kids to see that.  Hey, Lenny, Lenny, you know what show I'm digging these days?  Which one?  Watch this day.  A boot can.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Have you flipped together?  Have you flipped off together?  You've got a fetish now?  You need some people spanking you and screaming and yelling at you? 
[02:03:00]  That's what it is.  Get married.  Get married.  You're going to have a boot can 24 hours a day.  So what happened to the hot?  Oh, well.  Can we discuss that or are we stuck in the chat?  Yeah, no, that's fine.  It's their fault it happened.  First of all, you know, Dennis tells everyone,  Oh, no, you know, I wrote this show with Lenny and mine.  He's a liar.  He wrote the show with me and lied, but then I auditioned.  And then they said, well, we've got a few other people who did a good job.  I said, well, bring them down.  I'll slap them around.  And I said, well, why do I have to audition? 
[02:03:30]  You're a big star.  Can't you just give me?  He said, well, Lenny, you want me to give you the show just because you're my friend?  They said, duh.  Yeah.  He said, well, I can't do that.  I said, well, maybe not what I'm going to go to French.  So we go down and I whack these guys out.  I mean, I really kick some ass and I get the job.  And he said, does it make you feel better to know you've won the pot on your own?  I go, not one bit.  I said, what if I had a bad day?  You know what I mean?  There's a lot of people who are auditioning machines.  I wanted that job.  Did I lose you?  No.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know your job.  Oh, anyway, so they check my heart, the blood bumper thing there. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And they say, are you all right?  And I go, yeah, why?  And they go, your heart's all screwed up.  I said, what do you mean?  So they get all these tests and they say, you should be dead.  And I said, really?  They said, your heart is beating 192 beats per minute.  I go, isn't that like an athlete?  And they went, no.  Because I thought war would be better.  Athletes beat like 70, 60, 70.  I'm doing like $1.90.  And they go, you could drop it any minute.  So then I had to take all these pills and I had to go to all this medication and stuff. 
[02:04:30]  Maybe you should say no to the running scenes in the job.  Well, you know what I did?  I did that one running scene and I pulled up lame.  What do you call it?  A hamstring?  I haven't done this in 20 years.  You know what I mean?  I haven't always been a big, fat, loaded guy.  I used to be in great shape.  But anyway, I pull up lame and they said, well, do you want to go to a hospital?  I go, no, I'm not no pussy.  You're a hospital.  You want me to go for the rest of the day?  I'll go home and put some heat on it or something.  They said, well, we're going to send a massage therapist over to you, my wife.  Hey, you should. 
[02:05:00]  So I go home and I tell the wife, I said, hey, I got a massage therapist coming up there  in a little while.  You might want to go shopping or something.  So the doorbell rings and they looked the guy up and it's that big, fat, sweaty guy, bigger  than me.  And I go, hey, how are you doing?  He goes, I'm Lenny.  He goes, I'm Lenny.  He goes, I'm Lenny.  He goes, I'm Lenny.  I go, oh, this is not my life.  So I come in and I tell the wife to keep an eye on this guy.  You know, because he was big, you know, and they could have knocked me out with that  secret, you know, death hole thing.  A ton of things is going to have their way with me.  You know, and then I have more problems than a bad heart.  Well, you didn't send me a girl? 
[02:05:30]  No, they thought it was a big joke and then I had to pay the guy.  I go, what kind of company is this?  I mean, they reimbursed me, but what if I didn't have the cash?  What if I didn't have the jet that week?  I would have been out of luck.  He'd have taken her out in trade.  Oh, jeez, that's all I need.  So, Lenny, what's happening on the job tonight?  The job tonight, we go to a massage parlor.  Evidently, my character, Frank, used to frequent these places quite a lot.  And Dennis has got to go and investigate you.  He asked me how to get them to, you know, actually do the deed. 
[02:06:00]  And I tell them and all hell breaks loose.  Right.  But I think there's, I think there may be an ass shot of me tonight.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, I don't want to scare the kids either.  But, you know, you never know what's going to happen in this show.  A little public crack.  The language is one thing.  You know, the content.  The drugs, the booze, the smoke.  But your ass, Lenny, they've got to go up the line somewhere.  I think I wanted to get a stunt ass, but, you know, they won't listen to me.  That would be fun. 
[02:06:30]  It won't be that guy who gave me the massage.  I'll tell you that right now.  Hey, Lenny.  Yeah.  Elizabeth Hurley.  Oh, man.  It was amazing.  She was on, what, the second episode?  Yes.  Yes.  It was one of the dream come true of my life.  And I was fearless because I knew she wasn't going to have sex with me.  So I could do whatever I wanted with her.  Everyone else is trying to wheel with her.  Oh, God.  They're all dressing up.  They're all looking good.  I come in there sweaty.  Spain's all over me.  Hey, how you doing?  You know, you hang around with Paul Verratti?  You know, she's a fat guy. 
[02:07:00]  He sings, middle of it.  You know, maybe, you know, in one of your crazy fashion shows you may have come across.  You know, because I think that guy.  You're the only fat guy I know.  So I had a blast with her.  And I think she'll be cheap.  I think if my wife wasn't around, I could have done that.  Oh, yeah.  I really figured.  You know, I got the feeling.  You know, I can get the feeling, fellas.  Hey, hey, who got a piece of that?  You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think anybody did.  But I think I was the closest.  You were the closest.  In my mind, I had it twice. 
[02:07:30]  I gave her the best 35 seconds of my life.  Where are you living, down here?  Right now I'm in Martha's Vineyard where I live.  Oh, you live in Martha's Vineyard?  I live in Martha's Vineyard.  I got a beautiful six-and-a-half-acre spread.  I'm a mile and a mile off a dirt road, off a dirt road.  I could kill you with a high-pod rifle before you ever heard it coming.  Unbelievable, fellas.  I really made it.  Yeah, that's if you were allowed on a gun in that commonwealth.  Oh, well, yeah, the People's Republic of Chilmont.  I can't get down any trees, you know.  But unfortunately for me, there was a big tornado came to it. 
[02:08:00]  It sounded just like a chainsaw.  A tornado.  Well, maybe it was a typhoon because I'm close to the water.  And one of those things, the spigot, I don't know, it was bad.  It was bad because now all I can see is water.  Wasn't that just you heading for the buffet table?  I tell you what, man.  I'm planning on getting real sick this summer and losing a lot of weight.  Yeah?  Well, that's one way to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, you can work a cold into an ammonia into a flu and, you know, you'll  nearly die if people say, you look great.  What happened? 
[02:08:30]  I get sick.  Hey, Lenny.  Yep?  When you get sick of the wife, come on down and hang with us.  We're doing some sick stuff on the show these days.  You guys, I'm telling you, man, I'm so happy.  Not only are you kicking ass down there, but you're syndicated on weekends, right?  Yeah, a little bit here.  Yeah, a little bit here.  You're syndicated.  I want to tell your listeners, these guys are so whacked out.  The company that got them fired, that was behind it, hired them back for the weekend syndication.  You guys rock.  I love it.  And I want to say, once again, I'm Nick Carter. 
[02:09:00]  I hope I get this on the internet there.  You are the man, though.  All right, guys.  All right, Lenny.  Listen, thanks for talking to the show.  Tell all your listeners, let me tell you this, I really appreciate it.  And you're listening to Two Wackiest Sons of Pitches in New York City, O.P. and Anthony,  on whatever channel you're on.  Hey, Lenny, you've got to come by and see us next time here in New York.  You've got it.  I'll drag that little bastard Adam over there.  We'll have a ball.  And remember, the Socks suck.  Hey, listen. 
[02:09:30]  You know what can I say?  You know, it doesn't faze me.  After 67, I gave up on that.  67?  Yeah, I snuck into 43 games that year.  Yeah?  Hey, you know, you're a kid from the projects.  You don't get any money.  You're going to make your own fun.  Oh, Boston, man.  I love it.  Yeah.  All right, Lenny.  Thanks, fellas.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you, Lenny.  Good talking to you guys.  Later.  Bye.  Good job.  There he goes.  On ABC.  8 o'clock?  No, no.  9.30.  9.30 after Drew Carey.  Right after Drew?  Well, I don't know, because I have to tape everything. 
[02:10:00]  I don't see anything when it's actually on.  Right after Drew Carey on ABC.  9 o'clock.  You know, I'm down in New York.  I thought I was with the mother-in-law again.  Where's my box of wine?  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Do we have time to take the next phone call?  The guests are getting better and better today.  What do we got?  Jerry.  Hello.  It's Jerry.  Yes, it is.  Hi, Jerry.  Is this Anthony and L.P.? 
[02:10:30]  Yes.  How are you?  Are you a little worried?  No, not at all.  Are you?  No, not at all.  It's not from the phone sounding like crap.  What phone are you on?  I'm on my phone at home, actually.  Yeah?  This is Jerry from Survivor.  Yes.  Have you been briefed about any of the other Survivor interviews on this program?  Mitchell said he had a really good time with you guys.  Yes.  We like the Mitchell, yes.  Yeah, Mitchell's my favorite.  And we like Kimmy. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, I never really got to know Kimmy.  No, I know.  She was in the other tribe.  Yeah.  And I do know that Kel hung up on you guys.  Ah, Kel.  Well, we asked him to...  You know what?  I don't blame you.  We asked him a little too much about his whacking.  Yeah, the whole gig there was that he was spanking it in the woods.  Well, some people just don't have a sense of humor.  What can I say?  Now, Jerry.  Ah, I don't like you.  Whoa, Opie.  Now, that was Opie, Jerry. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, but I mean, she's used to this, though, because I think everyone hated you, right?  Yeah, not everyone.  I have a few sparse fans out there.  Just a few, though.  Yeah.  You got on everyone's nerves.  Yeah, what can I say?  I'm an honest person.  Some people can't handle the truth.  I mean, you're hot and all, but, man.  Well, thank you.  I don't even know if I want to talk to you.  Oh, man.  You made my...  You made my survivor experience horrible.  What was she doing that you didn't like?  Conniving and bitchy. 
[02:12:00]  Were you conniving?  I think you have to be.  It is a game, after all.  Yeah?  I don't know.  But you weren't...  You were bitchy?  But you weren't acting.  It was your real self.  That's what I had a problem with.  Oh, would you rather I do steak with you, huh?  Make believe you're nice, you know?  You're that.  I have a nice person when I'm not starved and sleep-deprived.  Oh, is that what it was?  Oh, for God's sake, yeah.  What was she doing, Opie?  Because I've got to admit to you, I don't watch the Bible. 
[02:12:30]  Well...  Opie is addicted to it.  I'm not...  I just...  Yeah, I like the show and stuff.  You wanted to ban Colby, right?  I was attracted to Colby.  He's got, like, effed up shoulders, though.  Well, you know, the whole thing is, regardless of whether you're attracted to someone or not,  once you start playing the game, everything gets so weird and twisted  that it's pretty much impossible to try and get anything going with somebody.  Well, there was a rumor that you and Colby had some of that sex. 
[02:13:00]  One of the rag magazines, I believe.  Absolutely not.  And I believe everything I read in those.  Oh, well, that says a lot about you.  They found the Loch Ness Monster, you know.  Oh, my goodness.  No, there's nothing true about that rumor at all.  No.  No.  So who did you truly hate?  Well, first of all, hate is a very extreme word. 
[02:13:30]  I didn't really care for Keith.  Keith?  He didn't get along.  No, well, that was obvious.  You didn't like his cooking skills.  God, I watch this show too much.  I need to, like, hope he knows everything about Survivor.  Everything.  Well, I mean, does it make sense to you that a gourmet chef couldn't make rice?  You didn't have, like, stuff to work with.  We had a pot and water.  What else do you need for rice?  I see some of those cooking shows when nothing else is on them.  They've got all sorts of stuff.  What was the problem with his cooking?  It was horrible.  He couldn't make rice, which is pretty sad.  Actually, you're claiming to be a chef. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it didn't make any sense to me, and I had to call him on it.  You know, I'm not just going to sit idly by while everyone starves because no one wants  his rice.  Yeah.  You know?  Wow.  See, we're trying to ask you stuff that you haven't been asked before because I'm sure  you've done a hundred of these interviews.  Like, tell us something about Survivor you haven't told anyone else, on the radio at least.  Oh, God.  Like a little tidbit, something that was going on that the cameras may have captured, but  they didn't want to air it or something.  Something.  Give us something. 
[02:14:30]  Something juicy.  Well, we did actually see an Aborigine, and that never made the show, and I don't know  why.  Yeah?  What?  You saw one just, like, walking around?  Well, when the fires were raging really hard, across the water, there was an Aborigine  that kind of was watching us from a distance.  We never made any contact with him, but we just kind of sat there and checked him out,  and he was checking us out, and then he moved on.  That's a little creepy.  Like seeing a Yeti. 
[02:15:00]  You know what?  It was a little bit creepy, to be honest with you.  No, because they're scary looking.  Yeah.  They're very intimidating, but, I mean, they're also known to be very friendly, and...  They were friendly on that crocodile Dundee.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  They slung the little thing around.  They helped them out.  Exactly.  I mean, they're an amazing group of people.  They've suffered all kinds of environmental issues, you know, and...  Oh, live in a house.  What God say?  Invent the wheel.  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  Why bother when you know you can do it alone on your own?  So how horny were you?  You guys talked about sex a lot.  Did you rub one out anywhere?  Oh, my God.  What?  Absolutely not.  Why?  It's natural.  No, Cal did that for all of us.  Did he really do it, though?  He still will not admit that.  You know what?  I have no idea, and I really...  I have no idea where that rumor even came from.  You know what John wants to ask you on line one?  He says, Jerry, did you get off when pounding the bongo drum between your legs? 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  That's a good question.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I see where this is going.  No.  Yeah.  This is a purely sexual interview.  No, no.  Not at all.  You did hear that you're negotiating with Playboy, though.  Is that true?  I'm not at liberty to discuss it.  Oh, that means it's crazy.  Yes.  What's your price?  I can't discuss that with you.  A million?  I think probably.  Well, how much did Darva get?  Because she's hotter than Darva. 
[02:16:30]  How much did Darva get?  I think she's half a mil.  Half a mil?  Darva Conner.  Remember her from that Marry a Loser millionaire guy?  No.  Oh, that's the one that married the millionaire.  You would think of your own Survivor.  You would know every reality show ever made, ever, ever, ever.  It was like that woman that married that guy who wants to marry a millionaire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then she thought he wasn't a millionaire.  Right.  Yeah.  And she made, she went at the Playboy. 
[02:17:00]  She made like a half a mil.  Good for her.  So, same deal for you?  Hey, someone wants to know if, you know what?  All right, don't hang up on me, all right?  Because it's just one of our listeners.  But I'm going to get to the second part of this question.  They want to know if they're real.  The answer, obviously, is they are real.  But what I want to ask you, Jerry, Tina, breast implants?  I don't know.  Oh, come on.  I have no idea.  To be honest with you, I wasn't checking out her boobs. 
[02:17:30]  You had to take a peek because she's wearing like these, you know, little outfits all the time.  Yeah.  Trying to recapture her youth.  I have no idea.  That's a little harsh, Opie.  What?  A little harsh.  Yeah, that is a little harsh.  So, what's going to happen on Survivor tonight?  You'll have to watch and see.  Ah.  Can I tell you that?  Well, can't you give us a little piece?  Absolutely not.  A little tidbit?  No. 
[02:18:00]  You've seen the trailers.  You know what's going on.  Yeah, that's true.  Hey, what do you think Keith's going to do with all that money?  Oh, God.  I don't think you guys will budge when we try that.  No.  I mean, there's something to be said for the potential of being sued for $5 million.  That'll keep your mouth shut.  Sued for $5 million?  Yeah.  Whew.  Yeah, that's a big number, huh?  Wow.  Yeah, I heard the contract you guys signed was like this ridiculous.  Hundreds of pages. 
[02:18:30]  It was a book.  Do you watch the boot camp?  Um, no.  Has it started airing?  Oh, yeah.  See, I really don't know.  I haven't been home for a week.  Where have you been?  I've been bouncing between here and New York, actually.  Where's here?  L.A.  Oh, you're in L.A.  I thought you lived in L.A.  Huh?  I thought you lived in L.A.  I do.  Oh.  I do, but I've been on this crazy media tour.  I've been in New York like a few times in the last week.  Hmm.  Except for you guys that, right? 
[02:19:00]  New York?  Yes.  Yes.  Well, how come you didn't invite me to the studio?  Would I have to come up?  Definitely.  We've had Mitch in the studio, Kimmy.  What?  Yeah, Kimmy's coming in tomorrow, as a matter of fact.  What?  Hey, Jerry, we've got a song for you.  Oh, no.  No, it's a good one.  Go ahead.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, man, come on. 
[02:19:30]  Jerry, that's terrible.  I was looking for something a little more current.  Why would you play this?  Were you that bad?  Were you really that hated?  Yeah.  Apparently so.  Wow.  All right.  I had a nap already. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, look at that.  You're getting a little angry.  I thought you were going to throw Elton John, the bitch's back, or something.  You know, something a little more up-to-date.  No, but who else played Ding Dong, the witch is dead, for you?  Come on.  No one.  I bet you heard some, you know, the bitch's back and all that.  Right?  No, no one's actually played any music for me.  That's the first.  And you go to Burning Man a lot?  Yep, every year.  You take your clothes off? 
[02:20:30]  Because I know that's a big naked thing.  Well, you know what?  There's a lot of people out there that aren't running around naked.  No?  It's not about getting naked.  It's just about expressing yourself.  Hey, any of the pictures I've seen from Burning Man, they're all naked.  That has to do with the photographer, I'm sure.  Yeah?  Because you know what happens.  You take all those...  Plenty of clothed people out there, too.  And you're one of those?  Yeah, I get more into, like, the costume aspect of it.  Yeah, Jerry, but there's, you know, a lot of people said that your nit popped out on one  of the episodes of Survivor.  What? 
[02:21:00]  And you were sending yourself.  I saw that on the Internet, yeah.  It was just a little bit, right?  No, I think it was...  A little peek?  No, I think it was a mistake.  My nipple never popped out.  No?  No.  No.  I'm just going through her pictures on the official Survivor site.  And?  Right here.  Very cute.  Yes.  No, she's...  I like the little cowboy hat one you got there.  Thank you.  I like the blue swimsuit myself.  No, look at that.  Anthony, she's very hot, but... 
[02:21:30]  Right?  She got on...  She got on everyone's nerves.  Yeah, but attractive girls can afford to be bitches.  No.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Have you noticed...  Thank you, Joe Pesci.  Have you noticed that?  That your good looks let you get away with being a bitch?  Well, you know what?  I think when women stand up for themselves and speak their mind, they're immediately labeled  a bitch.  If I had been a guy, I'm sure I would have been considered a hero out there.  Oh.  Okay.  I like the spin. 
[02:22:00]  That's very good.  Very good.  Very nice.  Yes.  You're quite the shucker, huh?  I'm looking at you.  It looks like you're shucking something here.  All right, Jerry.  Jerry?  Yes?  Jerry?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for us.  Can you all come in and, like, hang out with us?  Yeah, why don't you come in?  You know what?  The next time in New York, I would love to.  Really?  Absolutely.  Do you, like, drink with us and stuff?  We want to be friends now. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, you tip a few every so often?  Do you guys drink on the job?  All the time.  We were doing that yesterday.  Want to do some action stuff?  Oh, my God.  What?  I just thought I'd ask.  You don't do drugs, man?  No, I don't.  Not even a little weed?  You get psychomarker.  Get some AK-47.  Get into that wacky tobacco.  Oh, my God.  What?  You guys.  I'm just kind of trying to ask you out, I guess.  Oh, is that what that was?  This is what this is.  Does that work for you? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it works in New York.  You want a little coat?  Want a little blow?  What do you need, man?  Hey, this is no blind date, but, you know, she was on a blind date, Anthony.  You were on a blind date?  Oh, that was like two years ago.  Really?  Yeah, they made it look like I did it right around the same time as the show.  No, I can tell because your hair was kinkier.  And it was a lot longer.  And a lot longer, yeah.  Yeah.  Did you put out on that thing?  Did I what?  Did the people have some relations on those things?  I didn't. 
[02:23:30]  No, huh?  Absolutely not.  No cross-grabbing?  No.  I don't remember if that went well or not.  I don't remember seeing that one.  I took a peek.  I don't remember myself.  Let's just say there's a lot of cocktails involved.  A lot of cocktails.  Oh.  Oh, cocktails.  Right.  Of course.  Wow.  So you are a big drinker.  Since I was on blind date.  And then you stopped?  Well, there's something about being a little bit drunk on national television that makes you  kind of slow down.  Try it on radio. 
[02:24:00]  Come on up here.  We'll get you hammered, a little coke.  Oh, my God.  Why not?  Why?  You guys are horrible.  No, we're not even on the radio anymore.  It's just us just flirting with you.  Yeah, whatever.  We went into commercials like five minutes ago.  You like crack?  Oh, I don't believe you guys.  Do you like dough and stuff?  Oh, my gosh.  Knock it off.  No.  We haven't, you know, just having fun.  We haven't had a celebrity yet.  Yeah.  I wonder why. 
[02:24:30]  By the way, you have to date both of us at the same time.  You're going to play cards on your back.  Can we put you on the road, sir?  Are you going to play cards on your back?  No.  No?  No, thanks.  That doesn't sound like too much fun.  It is fun.  That's great.  Didn't you see The Sopranos this day someday?  Rock, where was that two of you?  Did you watch that show?  The Sopranos?  Yeah.  I love The Sopranos.  Isn't that good?  It's my favorite show.  Do you want to get on that? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Because I can help.  I've just shown interest in getting on there.  I can help you out.  Oh, really?  For a bloat?  Oh, man.  Why?  Jerry, I apologize.  That's not, that wasn't cool.  I can hook up young starlets that want to get us started in the...  You are strong, aren't you?  I'm hammered.  I'm actually drinking Vicks Chloroceptic.  Over here.  We have some extra Sam Adams from yesterday's show.  That's not it. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, you do some dope, though, right?  Come on.  You guys...  Come on.  I don't know if this works for you in New York, but definitely not for me here.  Come on.  You're going to scare me.  You're going to make me out when I come in the studio now.  No, we...  We...  What?  We thought we were getting along.  Here's a perfect...  Here's a perfect date.  We go out, right?  Me and you, we go out.  I pump you full of champagne. 
[02:26:00]  And we smoke a little pot.  We do some coke.  Go out to a club.  And you...  Yeah, yeah.  You suck it in the back room.  And then I can get you on the Sopranos, I swear.  Wow.  You want to be a Bada-Bing girl?  No.  If you're within resistance, I'd have to slap you.  Yeah, then you slap me.  But you'd like that, wouldn't you?  We'd like to slap.  Yeah, you'd like that.  And then I knock your cans around.  Good God.  You're a fucking horse. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, hey.  No, Mark, cut it out.  That's horrible.  I'm sorry.  That's Mark.  Michael Mark is in here.  And his name is Psycho Mark for a reason.  He's got like Tourette's almost.  He blurt stuff out.  So, Jerry, do we have a shot?  Like maybe a slight shot?  Is the door ajar?  Just a little bit?  You know, it's not looking good.  You're a little fish.  That's right.  You're a fish.  And I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  How do you keep things tidy down there? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  No, like, because a lot of girls now, especially actresses, they do a bikini thing, you know,  shave.  Nice to know the environment, Poon Chang.  Is it Hitler mustache, Mohawk, True Triangle, or the JonBenet?  And before she thinks of hanging up again on us, Anthony, Kimmy answered that question,  and she played the game with us.  Kimmy's very cool with us.  Kimmy rubbed the phone down there so he could guess.  I'm not Kimmy.  Can you rub the phone?  Are you trying to say that our lovely Kimmy's a whore? 
[02:27:30]  No, I never said that.  I never got to know Kimmy.  I don't even know the food any better.  I never got to know Kimmy.  I can't make any determination.  Don't you stare at it.  Eat it.  That's what you'll be hearing.  Oh, my God.  On our dream date.  We'll do that dating game thing like you went on.  Blind date.  Me and you.  Blind date.  Right?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Dice, shut up. 
[02:28:00]  That's Dice.  We apologize.  You guys are disgusting.  We go out.  Wait, we're disgusting?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  You take the subway because you come and see me.  Wait.  A turn for the worse.  I thought we were, you know.  Well, if all of you wasn't being so nasty.  No, it was you, Anthony.  No way.  I'm trying to be nice.  Right, Kimmy?  I apologize.  Kimmy?  You got the wrong guess.  Jerry.  This is Dice.  Hi, Jerry.  Yes.  Can I have your phone number? 
[02:28:30]  I'd like to call you after the show.  Absolutely not.  I kind of apologize for everything that just happened.  Oh.  You sure?  Absolutely not.  All right.  Where do you live in L.A.?  Hollywood.  Yeah, I bet.  That's nice out there.  Nice.  My gosh.  You know what?  I think you guys make it a point to try and make people hang up on you guys.  No.  Is that your mistake?  No, that's another game we like to play. 
[02:29:00]  We're not in that mode today.  You're the lesbo.  You ever do that?  What's that?  What would you do to be in a movie?  Would you do something really bad?  No.  Would you touch it?  No.  No.  I'm not desperate by any means.  Anal?  Oh, God.  That's what I mean, my friend.  You ever done that?  Oh, God.  You ever do the anal?  It's a little weird, isn't it?  Exit only.  Oh, okay. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Now we're getting somewhere.  And I think these are questions no one else has asked there.  That's right.  Well, that is true.  Call the Inquirer.  You guys are definitely one of a kind.  We have a quote for the Inquirer.  Well, I think we got a lot accomplished here today.  I think so, too.  Oh, my.  Thank you, Kimmy.  Anthony.  What?  I don't watch the show.  It's Elizabeth. 
[02:30:00]  I'm sorry.  Elizabeth is hot.  Hey, Elizabeth is really hot.  Would you jump on top of Elizabeth?  Yeah.  Bump some donuts with her?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  You got to admit she's hot.  She's a cutie.  Yes, she is.  No, she's hot.  Who is the slob on the show, Deb?  The slob?  Yeah, Debbie.  Deb.  I never got to meet her.  Yeah, she was, like, booted, I think, right after she's left the plane.  Yeah, she was.  I never got to meet her.  She never got a chance on track. 
[02:30:30]  She made it a day.  I think she was sporting some man meat in those pants.  Oh, like you didn't think that when you saw the first episode.  She's in Hollywood.  She sees a lot of the, uh, the transgressions.  The transgressions, the transgressions, the transgressions, the transgressions, right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You into that one?  You into that, aren't you?  No.  You're a dirty girl.  I hate to disappoint you, but no.  I can tell, Jerry, you're a dirty girl.  Well, you like it in all kinds of strange ways, right? 
[02:31:00]  Do you work for some sort of sex hotline or something?  No, that's fine.  You have a great voice for it.  You should look into that.  Yeah, and you end up in my trunk.  It's a paper on your ankle.  Try to survive that.  Survive a date with me.  Later, God.  Hey, you're bleeding from the ears and your head's ringing.  Oh, my God.  That's a date.  Hey, is it true you went out with Lou Diamond Phillips?  I did meet him a long time ago. 
[02:31:30]  He turns girls back.  He turns them a label.  Something happened.  Yeah, his wife blew him off to munch Melissa Etheridge.  Yeah.  Very good, Opie.  That's true.  I did meet him, but the rumor is not true.  His wife likes the pink lettuce.  Oh, my God.  Pink lettuce.  Take your balls and take it off now.  Oh, sorry.  Vince McMahon was checking in right there.  Jerry from Survivor on the phone. 
[02:32:00]  You're a girl.  Oh, wow.  Your CBS representative in big capitals with a lot of exclamation points is saying on the phone screen,  please, please, for the love of God, we have to go.  Damn.  All right, Jerry.  Thank God.  Oh, you had fun, though, right?  Come on.  We're having a good time, right?  Yeah, you guys had fun.  I'm big, big black.  You didn't realize that we were black, right?  What?  I'm big, dick, black. 
[02:32:30]  Big, dick, black in here.  You like black guys?  What's the matter?  Are you racist?  Yes, help me, please.  I'm big, dick, black.  Hey, Jerry.  Yeah.  If this means anything to you, I hated your guts before this interview, and now I kind of like you.  I kind of like her now.  But now I'm thinking she hates our guts.  Isn't it weird how it turns, see?  Now we're having fun.  Yeah.  We had fun, though, right?  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  You'll remember this day.  You went out with Joe Rogan?  Oh, no.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Comedian Joe Rogan.  Yeah, a long time ago.  What was his big bit?  What was his what?  What was his big bit he used to do?  I think he used to squash the watermelon.  No, that's kind of like him.  Oh, oh.  No.  What did Joe Rogan do?  You guys would probably get along very well with Joe Rogan, actually.  Oh, see?  She is a dirty girl.  He has kind of the same sense of humor, isn't he?  Yeah?  Yeah.  You chuckled at us a little bit. 
[02:33:30]  I think she's going to go away from this interview feeling good.  I know.  Jerry?  Yes?  We'll let you go.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  You sure?  I think so.  We haven't had you yet.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Yeah.  Give us that one.  No, I can't.  Wheelbarrel?  Baby crank fist?  What do you need?  We got it right here.  Cowgirl?  I'm a person.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Cowgirl? 
[02:34:00]  The cowboy hat.  You go cowgirl, right?  Backwards on top, right?  Yes, of course.  Doggy?  I'm a virgin.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, and I'm the Pope.  Virgin.  Virgin.  All right, Jerry.  All right, Jerry.  All right.  Thank you so much, Jerry.  Thank you.  And I apologize for Opie.  He was very rude.  That was Anthony, really.  I still think I have a shot. 
[02:34:30]  All right, Jerry.  We're going to watch Survivor.  When is it on again?  Tomorrow, right?  Eight o'clock tomorrow.  Eight o'clock tomorrow.  On CBS, I think?  Yes, that would be the right station.  Yeah, we work for CBS, too.  That's right.  We do.  Hey, did you see our little TV show?  No, I didn't.  We were on TV.  Were you?  All over the country.  But it was NBC.  For four weeks.  Wow.  Don't just stare at it. 
[02:35:00]  Eat it.  We were part of that XSL thing.  Oh.  And you thought you were the only TV star, huh?  I wouldn't say why I didn't see it.  All right.  They're begging us on the other line.  They called in to let Jerry go.  Thank you, Jerry.  Thank you.  You guys have a good night.  You too.  All right.  It's Jerry from Survivor.  There she goes.  On our night CBS.  Did we talk to Claudia and see how that went?  She just hung up. 
[02:35:30]  Damn it.  Oh, I was hoping she wouldn't hang up.  By the way, I cannot take credit for Ding Dong, The Witch is Dead.  Whoever called in with that.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  Absolutely brilliant.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  I think we got a lot of questions.  Look at Ben.  Look at Ben.  All right, Ben.  Okay.  Spot.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, we have to play Steve's wow song.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Whip him up.  Whip him up.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy name? 
[02:36:00]  Like some kind of sexist guy name?  Yeah.  You will not get away with me.  I wish you could just shut your bitch after.  Just whip him up.  Who's this?  This is Debbie.  Uh-oh.  From CBS?  Yeah.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Is this on the air?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We thought it was Claudia.  No.  I've been listening.  Hey, chat.  Are you going to try and get me fired?  Why?  What happened?  We thought it went well.  Yeah.  Real well.  Oh. 
[02:36:30]  What?  Is she okay?  I see you guys all the time and this is what you do.  Is she okay?  She's fine.  The listeners loved it.  They're all going to watch it.  They really liked it.  Yeah.  For your listeners, don't sign my paycheck.  I thought it went well.  So she seemed to be going well with it.  And I thought we were having fun.  We thought if she didn't enjoy herself, she would have hung up and then we would have won the hangover.  So she didn't want to be rude to you guys.  Oh.  That's nice of her.  That's my job.  I thought it went very well.  You went overboard.  How could you get in trouble? 
[02:37:00]  Anybody else would have hung up on you.  You know that.  I feel like you do these things just to make them hang up.  No.  No.  Or to see how many buttons of mine you can push.  I'm sorry.  But we were just doing an interview.  I know.  We didn't want to ask the same boring questions.  No.  I understand that.  But...  How does that get you in trouble if we ask bad questions?  Well, because they'll tell me I'm supposedly the person who's in charge of booking them on good radio stations. 
[02:37:30]  So you're saying we're not good?  But we're legendary for our radio interviews with the Survivor Cat.  I understand that.  I understand that.  But there isn't...  Hello?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Yes.  Yes.  What was the point where we went too far?  Just so we understand the next time.  I don't have to go through this.  I'm just letting you know that you're not helping me.  But, like, I don't want you to describe it and feel uncomfortable.  But when did it go wrong?  You know.  When we said hello?  Hi, Jerry. 
[02:38:00]  No.  Like, what went over the line?  So we understand, you know, because you're hopefully going to give us whoever gets kicked off this week, right?  Yeah, sure.  I don't think so.  Oh, but we were doing so well.  You got to be punished.  Time out.  But we had such a good, you know, thing going with you, finally.  Last year, you only gave us one guy from Survivor.  This year, you gave us...  Listen, I'm your biggest fan, and this is what you do to me.  No, we've had good interviews with Survivor.  Yeah, we've had good interviews.  Kel was good, right? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, sure.  I don't talk to Kel.  You're right to the Kel.  And as a result of that interview, I don't talk to Kel anymore.  How about Kimmy?  Yeah, Kimmy.  Kimmy, have you heard us from before?  Kimmy's going to be on our show tomorrow, and she's going to just promote...  How about we promote?  The big tall guy.  Yeah, Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch had a great time.  Yeah, Mitch is great.  Is Mitch gay, by the way?  I have no idea.  No, we asked him.  And what did he say?  I don't think we asked Mitch, did we?  I asked him, and he had to take the sea out of his mouth to say no.  No. 
[02:39:00]  Now she's going to get mad at him.  Yeah.  No, we asked the other guy from...  Oh, my God, I forgot his name.  The other guy from New York, the computer guy.  Debbie, help me, please.  Jeff.  Jeff, thank you.  Jeff, can we...  Can we smooth this whole thing over, Deb?  It's so smooth.  Is there some way to smooth it over?  How about we play Guess What's in My Pant?  I don't think so.  But you said you were...  I'm walking down the street trying to get home, and I'm listening to you guys on the radio.  But you said you were...  I'm like, what is going on? 
[02:39:30]  I can't leave the office for five minutes.  Should we send you flowers and stuff?  No.  What do you want?  Please, save the company's money, all right?  What do you need?  Oh, yeah, we're in the same company.  Welcome home.  For now.  Don't send me flowers.  CBS.  CBS.  The Tiffany Network, by the way.  The Tiffany.  Welcome home.  Welcome home.  Right.  Are we done?  You want some coke?  No.  All right, Debbie.  Wow.  I haven't been yelled at since...  I hope this is a good idea for you. 
[02:40:00]  I haven't been yelled at since I was 15 and came home late.  All right.  Well, I hope you guys are going to play this interview that you just had with Jerry every Thursday,  because that's the last Survivor interview.  No, no, no, no.  We can't play like this.  That's not nice.  You've got to give us another one.  Really?  Come on.  It's the only way we can redeem ourselves.  Okay, look who's left on the show.  Look who's left on the show.  What if...  Well, who would I put on your show that's left?  Why don't you give us one more chance?  One more chance? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, because we still want to...  How about Amber?  We still want to ask Tina if they're real.  Oh, wait.  As sweet as Amber is, you think she'd be on your show?  We want Amber, and we want...  I know you want Amber.  Yeah.  Elizabeth, too.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah, we need Elizabeth.  I think they're two very nice girls.  Do you think I'd subject them to that?  Yeah, right.  They're more than nice.  Let me tell you.  I'm looking at that photo gallery right now.  What?  All right.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  You'll be good, Debbie.  Yeah.  I've heard that before.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:41:00]  I'm just looking at Elizabeth's pictures.  Okay.  What?  I'm hanging up, guys.  No, Debbie, you've got to give us one more.  We've got to redeem ourselves.  One more chance, Debbie.  Like, we're addicts.  We understand our problems.  Well, continue to watch the show.  Thank you.  Wait, no, Debbie.  Like Daryl Strawberry, we have a problem.  We understand that, but we can't help ourselves.  You've got to be sympathetic.  Help us.  I don't think there's any kind of help.  Maybe you're Daryl Strawberry's wife.  Debbie, would you?  There's no radio anonymous group. 
[02:41:30]  What would Daryl Strawberry's wife do in this situation?  Give him another chance.  Well, she's a fool.  Debbie, would you help us, please?  Help us.  The first phone call is coming in.  This is just what the listeners are thinking right now.  No gang.  Oh, God.  Eric, Eric.  I don't have any insulting at all.  No, I'm just, Eric.  Yep.  Be nice to Debbie, but say what you want to say.  Debbie, I love Survivor, but if Opie and Anthony don't get anybody else from Survivor on the  Earth, I'm not watching it tonight or tomorrow night or whatever.  I'm not even saying it.  Here's a question for you, Eric. 
[02:42:00]  Do you have a Nielsen box?  Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.  And I told him that I was a black family and I'm watching everything.  Debbie, you didn't tell us what kind of box you have.  Hey, why?  What?  Anthony.  What?  I was saying Nielsen box, I meant.  Debbie?  Yes.  To you?  Well, open Anthony.  Tell me, do I want Survivor or not?  The call's up to you.  I think Debbie's going to do the right thing.  I'm sure that played that kill interview to entertain everyone. 
[02:42:30]  I think that the interview went very well.  Debbie's going to do the right thing.  I enjoyed all the interviews with ONA with the guys from Survivor.  I know why she's doing this, because Elizabeth gets kicked off next and she does not want  Elizabeth to appear on our show.  She's so right.  Oh, my God.  You nailed it on the head.  Speaking of that.  I left that door open for you.  All right.  That was like a slow pit softball.  Thank you, Debbie.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm not as quick as Anthony.  Too obvious.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, guys. 
[02:43:00]  Are we done?  Let me know at the end of the show.  All right.  Can you talk to Rick?  Yeah.  Rick, take her off the air, and we'll smooth this over.  Right.  Rick, work your magic.  Yeah.  Rick is good at this stuff.  Yeah.  Don't yell too much at me.  We'll leave it to Rick to clean up our message.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Debbie.  Bye-bye, Debbie.  Bye.  Okay.  All right.  Later, guys.  I'm going to listen to myself on the radio.  All right.  Debbie, if you'd like, we'll apologize to Jerry if she calls back.  I think we should send her flowers, frankly.  Have a call back.  We'll smooth things over. 
[02:43:30]  No, no, no.  Could you do that?  No, no, no.  She's not talking to you guys anymore.  We don't.  No.  No, have her call back, and we'll apologize.  Yeah.  We didn't know you were going to.  Why did you guys send her a lovely note?  A lovely basket?  Oh.  Hey, we're going to spray in your food.  What?  All right, Debbie.  Hold on.  There goes Debbie.  We love Survivor.  Yes.  Watch it.  And we love Debbie from CBS.  Mm-hmm.  The Tiffany Network.  All right.  We might as well do our live read for PowerTel, Avicor. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my God.  We've got about 80 spots to play.  Oh.  Anthony, if you're losing your hair like Debbie is, um...  Oh.  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Yes.  You're not losing your hair, right?  Am I what?  Are you losing your hair?  Am I losing my hair?  No, I don't have a losing hair problem.  All right.  I apologize.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[02:44:30]  Sometimes it's hard to be a woman...  Debbie?  Yes?  Do you hear the song?  We're romantic.  I thought you were taking me off the chair.  No, we just want to play a little song for you that might be a little inspirational.  It might help you help us out a little bit.  Because when you really think about it...  Yeah.  We're like family. 
[02:45:00]  Right?  Yeah.  And you...  No matter how bad we F ourselves up, we need you to stand by us, Debbie.  Uh-huh.  We're like in a relationship through the company, aren't we?  And sometimes we do things that might make you mad.  And even though we know we're doing it and we know we're being bad, we can't help ourselves.  We can't.  And we just need the support of the people that know we're doing wrong.  And instead of running off and not getting us any more survivor guests, we need you to help us, Debbie. 
[02:45:30]  To help us be by us as a family member and as a relationship.  And, Debbie, stand by us, please.  Stand by us, Debbie.  If there were some men in the room, I would.  Oh, Debbie.  That hurts you.  That's not standing by your man.  Debbie, are we going to have to play a tie of a ribbon around the old oak tree? 
[02:46:00]  And give us another survivor guest, Debbie, please.  Stand by your man.  Or men.  Okay, so good.  Show the world you love him, Debbie.  Keep giving all the love you can.  And all the survivor guests you can.  And play the club.  Thank you.  Well, we're going to start supporting boot camp.  All right, well, uh...  Am I dismissed?  Yes.  Yeah, Debbie.

All right.  All right, Debbie.  Rick, why don't you...  Hold on, Rick.  Take care of Debbie, please.  Rick, why don't you smooth things over and we'll get the real words.  Smooth things over.  Of what's going on.  Get us more survivor guests.  We screwed up that time, Opie.  Anthony?  Yes.  Dr. Gordon, he's the medical director of the Heron Skin Treatment Center in New York. 
[02:47:00]  He has some exciting news for balding people.  People lose their hair because of dihydrotestosterone.  Oh, I thought this was for Mujan.

Oh, there are half a still as they look.  I think we've found our man.  Opie.  I'm a Jolte radio guy. 
[02:49:30]  And I'm just being wacky.  This is Opie and Anthony's show.  We are a bunch of new times.  1027.  WNAW.  Time to play.  What did we learn on the ONA show today?  We're not going to get to Steve from FoundryMusic.com's wow song.  Oh, not till next week.  No, because, you know, we want to highlight it and really give it a little push there.  Well, yeah.  We've only got, like, a couple minutes left in the show. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, where's my five?  Yeah, goodbye.  We apologize, because our interview with Jerry from Survivor went a little long.  Yeah.  I just want to say, a lot of drug references were made today, Opie, and I just want to  tell the kids out there, don't do any of the drugs.  Thank you.  This is my disclaimer.  Don't do the H.  No, stay off the H, kids.  Stay off the H.  You know, we've had a lot of fun here with drugs today.  You know how they do that at the end of shows?  Like, at the end of these dad shows, and then the star of the show comes on and goes, 
[02:50:30]  we've had a lot of fun here today talking about drugs, but seriously, drugs are real fun.  And then they show a rainbow or something.  Yeah, yeah, some kind of rainbow.  If you want to learn more about drugs, go to a dealer.  He'll teach you everything you've got to know.  Stay out of the library.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  What did we learn on the ONA show today?  An education that you couldn't get at Harvard and Yale.  Right, right, right.  But you can on this show.  Let's start with Brian.  Brian, what's going on? 
[02:51:00]  Hey, ONA, first time caller, long-time listener.  Cool.  Yeah, I finally learned something on this show.  What did you learn, man?  I learned that the worst thing is, when you die, go to hell with an infection.  Don't go to hell with an infection.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right, you guys suck, man.  I'm going to hit myself.  Bye.  All right, bye.  By the way, all the local bands, send in your wow songs.  That's going to be a big part of Whip Them Out Wednesday this year.  Yeah.  Wow season upon us.  It went very well today.  Heard from a lot of ladies that were flashing all over the highways today.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Dan from Hoboken. 
[02:51:30]  I learned only black girls say baby.  Angela from the Bronx.  New Year, same Earl.  Today I learned that a man should never hit a woman until the fifth time she hits you.  Today I also learned that Jesus didn't die for our sins.  He died for a Vermont teddy bear.  I learned Titus gives Opie a run for his money and crazy family stories.  You know, I want him to go toe-to-toe with family stories.  Maybe the next time he's on.  Dude.  Unless you have some real bad ones in the closet somewhere, when your mom shoots the husband and then gets acquitted and ends up in a mental institution and drawing pictures with her, I guess I got some, man. 
[02:52:00]  I got some.  I don't know.  I still haven't told you what happened in my house when the blue comb was missing.  Remember.  And the tweezers.  Looking forward to the blue comb.  Dylan, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that if you're going to hit him, don't teach him how to fire the weapon.  Yeah, Titus taught us that.  Crimson, you're a pussy.  Later.  All right.  By the way, Christopher Titus today rocked.  Yeah, I had a lot of fun with him. 
[02:52:30]  And Christopher Titus will be at Caroline's tonight at 8 o'clock, two shows tomorrow.  I have a feeling he'll be back.  I think he had a really good time today.  Yeah.  Let me go to Derek.  Derek, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  I learned that you're a real scumbag to some of the people on the show.  No.  Yeah, some of the guests.  You just, like when you're on the, with Titus.  Just on the right, you know, you didn't like him that much.  Titus?  Yeah.  No, that's not true.  Because you're saying, you know, fake like you watch the show, like we do.  Oh, my God.  We were all just having a fun joke in. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  I think the guy.  Well, Jerry, I know you didn't like him.  We bust balls on everyone.  That's true.  I just said, I got to buy you.  You're a comic, Derek.  I just, my bad.  He was laughing when we said that.  I know.  He was hilarious.  Jerry, you were just getting a real dog on.  Derek, you got to understand our show.  If someone like Christopher Titus is going to be in the studio, what do you think?  We hate him or we support him?  And what are you doing?  Oh, I understand that.  Anthony sounded like he was on fun, but you, Anthony, you just sounded like kind of like  rude or mean.  Well, that I'll agree with. 
[02:53:30]  Thanks, Anthony.  Thanks for your support.  All right, Derek.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  I learned two things there.  Yeah.  Jerry likes the cowgirl style.  Yes.  And it shows you can't capitalize when your childhood suffering.  Very good.  Thanks.  Thank you, Jason.  Thanks.  Rich, yes.  To you.  What did I learn?  Yeah.  I learned that if you don't play Steve's new Wow song, he's going to just sit in his studio  and continue listening to it. 
[02:54:00]  That's what he's doing in there.  He loves his song.  I heard it.  I heard it.  You give birth to something.  You like it.  Oh, man.  You got to deal with it.  I think it's great.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Here's his Wow song.  Coming home from work today.  I got flags on the highway.  Got a hand just for the O&A.  But coming up, we'll whip them out Wednesday.  Black suits, you better double D. 
[02:54:30]  Some perky A's, but some, shall you see?  There's some old lady with a fit down to a knee.  Almost dressed my car into a tree.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back.  The moves are back.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town.  Little picture is all it's taste.  I'm the guitar that's been a while.  Goes a long way.  Good thing, a month should happen today. 
[02:55:00]  Soon and I'll say that the ship is going to break.  I swill in the back of the van.  I'm flashing my sights.  I'm flashing her again.  The moves are the eight or nine.  That's not part of my plan.  If I were Anthony, I'd be moving up my hand.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back.  The moves are back.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town.  The moves are back. 
[02:55:30]  Pull out your fun bag, then set your trap.  If I wanted it to happen, you'd like to squeeze your head.  The moves are back in town. The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town. The moves are back in town.  The moves are back in town. The moves are back in town.  Whip them out, wet and stuff. 
[02:56:00]  Now, I get a little bit of time to put on my scooter. I got a little while to come back.  You got one of those little scooters?  Eat pot black, bro.  Eat shimmy.  That's still one of my favorite wow calls of all time right there.  There you go. Steve from FounderMusic.com and Jimmy.  That's why we're jumping back on the radio.  Jimmy, he does a lot of the great production for our radio show.  I had a big hand in that as well, so I didn't want to take all the credit for it.  All right. And I heard him there in the chorus. 
[02:56:30]  Yes, yes. That was all Jimmy in the chorus, as a matter of fact.  Oh, what's the matter?  Because I had commercials to go cut.  And he said, well, he's not here. I might as well do it.  Yeah, that's how the Beatles did a lot of their recordings.  I think so.  That's why certain people took certain parts.  Commercials.  Exactly.  That's good.  We're encouraging you guys to send in your wow songs, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Your mic wasn't on, Bill. I'm sorry.  Okay.  I was just telling you it was a great song.  Good.  Mark from Jersey.  In early, what did I learn today?  I learned there's nothing wrong with going out and getting mischief. 
[02:57:00]  New Jersey dude from the message board.  I learned that there's a new wacky morning show called Stinky and Cream Cup.  I also learned that O&A are the Dow Strawberry of New York Radio.  More of your what do we learn as we try to get through this commercial break.  Boobs.  The world's universal language.  Kofi and Anthony.  Your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  M-E-W.  Have you noticed that since the day George W. Bush took office, there has been no concern 
[02:57:30]  whatsoever about the Y2K buzz?  Not a single awkward Cuban refugee incident and a grand total of zero Alaskan oil spills?  Well, at Comedy Central, we have noticed.  And in honor of his brilliant track record, we're giving George W. Bush his very own sitcom.  That's my Bush.  A brand new series tonight at 10.30, 9.30 Central from the creators of South Park.  That's my Bush.  The show that asks the question, what happens when a normal guy and his lovely wife move 
[02:58:00]  from Austin, Texas to Washington, D.C.  so he can become the leader of the free world.  And boy, if you think it's tough running the most powerful nation by day, wait till you  see what's in store for George W. when he gets home from the Oval Office each night.  That's my Bush.  From the creators of South Park, because a brilliant man deserves a brilliant sitcom.  That's my Bush.  A new episode tonight at 10.30, 9.30 Central, right after South Park, only on Comedy Central.  We're trying to get Matt and Trey on the show to talk about that new show. 
[02:58:30]  They look like it could be pretty good, no?  Yeah, but it's hard to get Matt and Trey.  I heard they're not doing radio for a couple of months.  What is with those guys?  We're not just any radio.  Yeah.  So Comedy Central will eventually call us and go, hey, Matt and Trey are available for an interview.  And that's when you and I will have to go, you know, we're not doing interviews until  July.  You're not available right now to fit them in.  Right.  We're a whole weekend and we talk to a Russian mob guy from the Sopranos.  I know.  Yeah, right?  We'll scoop them up in a second.  Let's not lie.  We've been getting some quality guests on this show lately. 
[02:59:00]  But it's not like Matt and Trey have to go through 8,000 stupid radio stations on a satellite  or something.  Yeah.  They can just come down and hang out.  We were convinced they liked us, too.  But it's all a clever ruse.  It has been a fiery little relationship with Matt and Trey.  Tell you that much.  Yeah.  Ice cream, PB, and everything involved.  Andre from River Edge.  I learned that Titus gets uncomfortable when he hears the N-word. 
[02:59:30]  Oh.  Titus.  Christopher Titus at Caroline tonight.  8 o'clock.  Two shows tomorrow.  Go see him.  Anthony Planet Java.  Yes.  Finally iced coffee.  Just got cool, Opie.  It's Planet Java.  The wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  And Planet Java ain't just some social drink.  It's iced coffee.  That lets you be yourself.  Why don't you tell them about it, and I'll go to the med game.  I know.  I'm sorry.  No, read through it, because I'm going to try to get a couple more.  What do we learn?  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling truck. 
[03:00:00]  They've hit the streets, and now they're out into an area near you.  What happened?  With cool, new flavors.  Javadelic, Trimble, and Karamocha.  What happened?  Hold on.  He just walked in on someone in the bathroom.  What did you do?  You went to take a leak.  I went to go take a leak.  And what do you call it?  The head muckety-muck of the sales department.  Yes.  Okay.  He was in there. 
[03:00:30]  What was he doing?  He wasn't standing.  It's a no-crunching zone.  No-crunching zone.  Not only that, the door wasn't even locked, for Christ's sake.  Oh, my God.  That's asking for it.  He wants it.  It's a no-crunching zone.  That's hilarious.  Now I've got to talk about Javadelic, the grown-up milkshake.  Or Karamocha, the chocolate caramel in coffee. 
[03:01:00]  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  It's a great mixture.  And Trimble, if you need some extra kick in your day.  It's got 121 milligrams of caffeine.  That should do the trick.  Trimble's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  That'll get you crunching.  Bill, I'm sorry.  You get to go home.  We work here.  And he just heard that as he's crunching.  He's going to come in and kick your ass. 
[03:01:30]  Who, cat and crunch?  Crunch.  He's going to have a butthickey.  Do yourself a Planet Java iced coffee with an attitude.  It's going to look like a newborn fawn when he gets up and falls.  You've been there so long and your legs go numb.  Bring around the balloon mat.  It's going to look like a newborn fawn.  Your legs are shaking. 
[03:02:00]  Whoa, my ass fell asleep.  With a butthickey, it's going to look like a dartboard.  You ever see when the mom tries to get the newborn elk up?  Anthony, through the magic of radio, Jeff Hedges, who sells for this fine radio show, very respected man.  Of course.  We've got the hidden microphone in the cruncher.  All right. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  Oh, and it ain't over yet?  What?  Oh, my balls. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, God.  Looks like you just dropped the Cosmic kids off in the pool.  It's not over yet?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like quite the job, isn't it?  Anthony, Planet Java, yes.  Meet yourself with Planet Java, iced coffee with an attitude, and available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, tell him to get it.  Iced coffee just got cool, and it's called Planet Java. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  We'll see you guys.  We really appreciate you checking out this mess.  It was a mess today.  There's more ways than one.  We got a pair of tickets, a couple pairs of tickets, a couple pairs of tickets to see Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry April 16th at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  A bunch of us are going on the show.  We got a Skybox and O&A section, and we're going to have a meet and greet with the band.  It's very cool.  These two bands rock, and we're going to have a lot of fun.  Two random callers right now, 212-757-1027, okay? 
[03:04:30]  Right.  Looks like he just rode a bike through a mud puddle.  Hey, Whit from Yonkers.  I learned today that the hot pumps the blood.  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's W-A-W.  Thank you.  It's W-A-W. </pre>
