<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic mix of listener interaction, travel mishaps, guest appearances, and off-color humor.  The show opened with a focus on listener-submitted audio clips, with the hosts expressing frustration at listeners failing to follow instructions for submitting audio to Steve at foundrymusic.com due to email forwarding issues.  A major storyline involved the disastrous travel arrangements for Jim Norton’s upcoming Mardi Gras broadcast.  XM Radio had failed to book his flights to New Orleans, a fact discovered by Club Soda Kenny, who was filling in for the absent Norton.  The hosts discussed the comedic challenge of breaking the bad news to the volatile Norton, further complicated by their agent, Bob, pushing for a “clean” show to appeal to commercial radio, a request they vehemently rejected.

The fallout from listener misbehavior also dominated the broadcast. Inappropriate emails sent to Dee Dee, a female co-host from XM’s children’s channel, led to her cancellation from the show. Her departure was marked by a comedic send-off, including a rendition of “Poop Goes the Weasel,” highlighting the hosts’ disappointment.  Kenny, in his role as fill-in, played a significant role in bridging the gaps in conversation.

The show featured several recurring segments.  One involved a series of radio promos starring a wealthy eccentric and his manservant, Ramon, characterized by increasingly absurd scenarios. Another segment showcased a listener-created song about “Steve the Bear,” described as unsettling and “creepy.”  Kenny provided news, sports, and weather reports in his uniquely rambling style, including humorous retellings of events featuring Condoleezza Rice and the Pope. A listener-submitted audio clip with a "worst smell ever" was also played.  The hosts also discussed banned Super Bowl commercials, including those featuring Mickey Rooney and spoofing the Janet Jackson incident, as well as a poorly-received *Happy Days* reunion special, prompting a conversation about aging and the awkwardness of seeing older versions of beloved TV characters.  There were several instances of off-air interaction with producers regarding missing audio clips and a frustrated exchange with someone named Damone about unprepared audio.

The *Happy Days* reunion critique continued into a later segment, focusing on the awkwardness of Fonzie's dance and Scott Baio's acting.  This was followed by a caller, Mark Patrick, recounting a rambling tale about a cruise ship talent show, which the hosts frequently interrupted.  A crucial phone call with Jim Norton revealed the full extent of his travel issues, causing him considerable anger. The hosts also briefly discussed the death of John Vernon, and a song, "Spread the Virus" from Wackbag.com, was played.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion on college admissions and intellectual disabilities, followed by a host's anecdote about a difficult plane experience with a passenger with Down syndrome.  The show then featured studio guest PJ Walsh (Blue Collar Comedy Tour) and an impromptu audition for a female newscaster, “Liz,” whose appearance was commented on extensively and explicitly by the hosts.  A dispute between the hosts over sound effects featuring Sandy Cain escalated into a childish argument.  Other guests included Pat from CringeHumor.net, whose interview with Kenny was marked by awkward and offensive questions, and comedian Lewis Black, who called in to discuss his absence and political views, criticizing George W. Bush.  A planned interview with Tara Patrick was cancelled due to traffic.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous crude jokes and comments were made by the hosts and guests.

It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are gentlemen.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:05:00]  You won't be molested  Oh dear, oh dear  Hello, exactly  Okay, terrific  Do you know what a boob is?  So mad  You're so so mad 
[00:05:30]  You blundering bag of folks  But enough of this clever  I love that one  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America  If you're helping out, thank you  Thank you very much  Thank you 
[00:06:00]  Gotta start off really fast  With some house cleaning, Anthony  Reading lots and lots of email  From the faithful listeners  Thank you for writing us  And suggesting things  People are kind of bitching  Because we're not writing them back  We just can't write everyone back anymore  We just can't  Sorry, Jesus  It's impossible  But know this  We read every single one of your emails  Everything gets read  It's just usually it's not important enough to answer  Wow 
[00:06:30]  Is that what you're trying to say?  Is that we read it  But most of it is just drivel  That doesn't even deserve a response  I took the polite approach  But okay  That's pretty much it though  But I read every single one  And people are trying to help us  With show prepping the program  Because it's kind of like  A people's radio program  It really is  Yes it is  It's very interactive  And the reason it is  Is so Anthony and I  Don't have to work as hard  Well that is the bottom line  And that's where we  That's our top priority 
[00:07:00]  Not working hard  A lot of people think  We're really smart out there  I guess we are  Because we're like anyone else  We have cool jobs  But you know  Technically it is a job  And just like any job  We don't want to work that hard at it  You come into work  What's your priority at work  Anybody  To do as little work as possible  Without anyone really noticing  Right  You're not doing as much work as you could  So we come up with this concept  Where we make it a  People's radio program  And it's interactive 
[00:07:30]  And God  If you find something on the internet  Please send it in  Right  Saves us time surfing around  We'll play it  We'll play it  If it's good  And if it really sucks  We'll play it too  Yeah  Who was it  Was that Dave Douglas  Our old program director  In Boston  That pulled us into a meeting once  And told us not to refer  To our jobs  As going to work  Yes  Or working  Yes  Because the listeners  Don't see it that way  Yes  They see it as 
[00:08:00]  You know  You're privileged to be sitting there  And doing a radio show  Serving the public interest  And it's not a job  So don't call it that  More psycho babble  From program directors  Dave Dickless  We stopped listening to program directors  Seriously  How many years ago  With Dave Dickless  Pretty much  We listened to him a little bit  Because we just started working together  So we're like  We're open to some suggestions  At the beginning  Yeah  And then  That had to end  I think we stopped listening to bosses in 96 
[00:08:30]  Yeah  Right around 96  We gave up  And just said  Screw this  Let's do what we believe is good  And guess what  As soon as we stopped listening to the bosses  Our show went through the roof  The meteoric rise  Or is it the mediocre rise  It's the mediocre rise  So with that said though  If you do have something really cool for the show  I mean I like listening to the clips  But make sure you send them to Steve  Steve is the audio guy here 
[00:09:00]  Right  I'm trying to let everyone  You know make everyone understand  Everyone's role here  Everyone's job  You have audio  Send it to Steve at foundrymusic.com  Now that's not the only reason  Because they've been sending it to you right  Yeah  And you can't send it to Steve  No  We lose the audio  Any fun things you've sent to Opie  Dagon  Yeah because as soon as I hit forward  And forward it to Steve  For some reason  It forwards the text  But it doesn't forward the file  And I don't need explanations why  I don't care 
[00:09:30]  Just send it to Steve as well  Easy enough  That's why a lot of you guys  If you send something cool  I write you back and go  Hey this is really cool  Can you please send it to Steve  At foundrymusic.com  That's the reason  Yeah  And I don't feel like changing my whole email program  And all that  So just  You know  Work with us here  Okay  Someone will send things  You've got to attach the file  Figure it out  Don't worry about it  But yeah  The virus is spreading  And it's starting to get very very exciting  On satellite radio  Very exciting 
[00:10:00]  At first  No one was really listening  But then again  Ant and I were very rusty  Thank God  If you were there from the beginning  If you were one of those people  That had subscribed  To the Opie and Anthony show  Before we even hit the airwaves  And heard that first show  Which at this point  Now it's a small percentage  Of the people that are actually listening to the show  Were there from the beginning  And boy you got a treat  Didn't you?  Yeah  You got to watch us  Regrow our program  Because as we see it 
[00:10:30]  We stunk  We really  Oh did we stink up the joint  We acted like we didn't  But we were awful  Yeah  Big plans for the Opie and Anthony program in 05  Big plans Anthony  Always moving ahead  Moving forward  Doing things  We got a delusional agent  He's out of his mind  Our agent I think is having a nervous breakdown  You got the Bob call too last night  Yeah I got the Bob call  There are people out there  Let's just say  That are very very interested 
[00:11:00]  In taking the show  And putting it back on commercial radio  And our agent  He wants us today  To do an absolutely clean show  That can be done on commercial radio  Yeah  Because there's one guy out there listening  Yeah  So Bob's logic is  Do one clean radio show  So this guy could go  Oh look see  Yeah  That could have been on my radio station 
[00:11:30]  And then you know  Bob being a dope  Doesn't understand  Then we go back to doing our regular show next week  And then there's the cursing  And some of the content  That's a little racy  Racy  A little blue  And then this guy  Who thought he heard us doing a show for commercial radio  Is going to go  What happened?  Uh huh  It's just not a way to get the show on commercial radio  Right  So today's show in particular  Is supposed to be a clean fucking show  Right  Bob go fuck yourself 
[00:12:00]  Not supposed to have anything  Don't  Actually he actually told me  You know  Do a show  Without talking about  Norton  Fucking a hooker in the ass  He did not say that  Yeah  And I was like  Oh tomorrow you want that?  Right  You're going to be taping it tomorrow for that?  Tomorrow they're going to be listening for the clean show  All right  All right  How about him sticking his hog in her mouth?  Is that good?  As long as we stay away from the ass?  See  It's just  He's a crazy person  It's just not the way to go about it 
[00:12:30]  And I was trying to explain that to him yesterday  But he wouldn't listen  And he's like  Just do one  Really clean show  Please  He's getting angry  And I'm like  Well that means that  It's going to be a boring show  And Anthony and I  Don't try to  Purposely do boring shows  Not purposely  Well sometimes they come  Sometimes they just stink  And we know that  But every day  We try to give you guys  An entertaining  Clever  Funny show  Yeah  I'm like Bob  It's not going to happen  We're just going to do the show  That we were hired at  XM Satellite Radio to do  And if you're smart enough 
[00:13:00]  And if there's  Station owners out there  That are smart enough  To figure out how to take  What we do  And throw it on commercial radio  Great  Then we'll go back to commercial radio  But we're not going to  Stop doing what we do here  In order to make it fit  And be boring  And have to adhere to all the regulations  And it's not why we came here  Logically  Logically here it goes  Okay  We don't really break that much  Uh huh  This makes sense to the  Commercial radio station  Owners out there  So we're doing a lot more radio 
[00:13:30]  Every day  We're probably doing the equivalent  Of a five hour talk show  For commercial radio  Right  So right there  There's a whole hour  An hour buffer  An hour buffer of material  You could just take out  And still fill four hours  On commercial radio  Okay  And believe me  You could take out the stuff  That can't go on  Terrestrial radio  And it's not going to  Amount to an hour  Here's the other thing  Just throw us an afternoon drive  We were the kings  Hoo hoo hoo  Of afternoon radio  Yeah 
[00:14:00]  So you take this show  And then you got  I told Bob  You got five hours  When we get off the air  To make it clean  And nice for commercial radio  Yep  For these people  That really want the show  Alright  There's no secret  Philly wants us bad  There's a few places in Philly  That want us bad  You just throw this on  An afternoon drive  Cleaned up a little bit  You're going to kill  In the ratings  Absolutely  But we're not going to  Compromise what we do  We were hired by  XM Satellite Radio  To do this edgy show  And we're going to  Continue doing it  Bob  Wants us to do 
[00:14:30]  A clean show  So that  The next day  The guy can go  Hey what happened  Exactly  We got a clean show  We put him on the air  And now  We can't use him  And people are just  Too god damn lazy  They hear the show  And go  Oh did you hear  What they were talking  About it's dirty  Yeah but if you put it  In afternoon drive  Or something  Then you can  Cut out the bad part  But that's too much work  Right  We're going to need  Someone that has a brain  You know maybe  Maybe Bob  The guys you're 
[00:15:00]  Dealing with down in Philly  Don't have a brain  Enough to figure this out  Uh oh  Have you ever thought  Of that Bob  Now you've done it  Have you  Because it got back  To Bob  Well there's  You know relatively  There's a lot of stuff  That could be on  Commercial radio  But at times  It's like a 40  45 second  Uh uh  Part of the show  That's just too dirty  For commercial radio  Yeah  Well that's where  You as the smart  Station owner  Figures out what  To throw in there  Figures out how  To edit the thing  It's not up to us  It's not up to us 
[00:15:30]  To clean up  To make one guy  In Philly happy  So the rest of the  Country is miserable  Because we're not  Doing the show  That we were hired to do  There you go  See  And I was on the phone  With Bob for a half  Hour and 40 minutes  He just doesn't get it  I was on the phone  Too with Bob  For a while  But in the background  He was hearing  Chicka ching  Chicka ching  What what what what what  What what what  What what what  Chicka ching  What what what what  What what what  That's poker  Being played online  Chicka ching  What what what what 
[00:16:00]  Cards being dealt  What what what what  So I'm not even  Paying attention  To half the stuff  He's saying  And he hears me  Like grit my teeth  Son of a bitch  What's the matter  Anthony  Oh nothing Bob  Nothing  I just got raped  The best part  The best part  Is like  When I just  Tire of Bob  Trying to convince  Me of these stupid  Things  I go  Will you call  Anthony  I know  Thanks  Because you really  Are the smarter  Person here  When it comes  Especially this  Stuff  You have a way  Of talking to him  And others  That that just  Brings it all  Together nicely  So when I get 
[00:16:30]  Just exhausted  I go you know  What Bob  Just call Anthony  He'll he'll explain  Because I  I'm I obviously  Am having a tough  Time explaining it to  You know  I'm trying to  Hold the phone  And play online  Then he's like  Well if you don't  Want to go back  To commercial radio  Just tell me  Yeah just tell me  And I'll stop  Working for it  I'll stop working  And trying  Just tell me  He doesn't understand  When you're just  In plain simple  English go  If the situation  Is right  Then fine  But we're not 
[00:17:00]  Going to you know  Start changing  Things around  Do a clean show  I said first of all  Tomorrow  We have guests booked  And they're probably  Going to come in here  And curse  Because that's what  People tend to do  When they come in here  Right  And then  For some reason  The guests sit down  And obscenities  Fly out of their mouths  Yeah and then  And then I'm like  Bob  So we would have  To go on the air  And tell all our listeners  Don't curse  Because we're trying  To do a really  Clean show today  Yeah don't  Call up and curse  And then he goes  Oh well what about  Monday  I go oh yeah 
[00:17:30]  Yeah we'll do a  Clean show from  Marty Graw  That's it Bob  How about that  Bob did  Well Opie  There's some  Colorful costumes  Down there on the street  And wow  They sure look  Joyous and happy  Bob last time  We went to  Mardi Gras  We almost got  Kicked out of  Mardi Gras  Because a girl  Was giving head  Live on our show  Okay  And that was  Terrestrial radio  Right  And we're going  To look for that  Girl again  When we go down  To Mardi Gras  Monday and Tuesday  See if she's still alive  So Monday and Tuesday  Bob sorry  The blowjob queen  Or something like that  Yeah  Yeah we almost got 
[00:18:00]  Kicked out of Mardi Gras  Who gets kicked out of  Mardi Gras  We almost did  Well exactly  So  And yeah that's  That's where we're  Sitting  So maybe Wednesday  Bob  Maybe Wednesday  We'll do our  Clean show for you  Bob  Right  But I doubt it  And if we ever do  A clean show  Just to cater to you  And this stupid guy  In Philly  That probably doesn't  Have a brain  To figure it out  On his own  You know what  I'm giving your  Email out Bob  So you can take  The complaints  From the listeners  There you go 
[00:18:30]  We're going to put  Them to sleep  With a clean show  God  Right  One other thing  Before we move on  Got to bitch  At the listeners  Yeah  You guys are  A bunch of  Douchebags  Thank you Anthony  Because they expect  They expect it from me  But when it comes from you  Oh no  Our listeners are tools  They ruin everything  This just in  Breaking news  DD  A.K.A. Cricket  Yeah  From the kids channel 
[00:19:00]  On XM Satellite Radio  Will no longer be  On our radio show  No longer  Because the listeners  Blew it  Because you guys  Wrecked it  You guys decided  It would be really funny  To email  The kids channel  On XM Satellite Radio  With your rude comments  Yeah good job  And then you  And then your rude comments  To DD personally  That well  The gang in Washington  Got a little nervous  Yep  And I don't blame them  On this one 
[00:19:30]  So I get bitched out  On the phone yesterday  For you guys  The listeners  I'm like hey  We don't control them  And Kevin's like  Well I think it would be best  If DD just stays  With the kids channel  Yeah  And I don't think  It would be smart  To have her on the air  With you guys anymore  So thanks guys  Because that was  Going to be a huge bit  Absolutely huge  It was working out  Fine  It was working out  Fine  She was good  On this show  And then she did  The kids channel thing  There was no crossover  It's not like we were  Cross promoting  You know  On each other's channel 
[00:20:00]  The kids channel  We stay as far away  From the kids channel  As is humanly possible  But the listeners  Then had to make  This interaction  Between this program  And the kids channel  With the god damn  Emails and stuff  And instant messages  And what not  And you ruined it  We all knew  We were in dangerous water  I mean  Of course  I just thought the listeners  Were smart enough  To figure it out  Like whoa  Hey she works for the kids channel  But she's talking dirty  On the Opie and Anthony show  We didn't even bring it up 
[00:20:30]  We didn't even bring it up  Because we figured  It would just be left alone  If we ever want  Websites attacked  Or people emailing  Rude comments to people  We let you know  This one  We left it alone  Figuring people  Would enjoy the radio show  Enjoy Deedee  Doing what she does  And we wouldn't get  They wouldn't ruin it  But you god damn jackasses  All the listeners  Are so friggin stupid  And we can't fight for Deedee  We lost that one  No  We lost it

[00:36:30]  Well, you know  I wanted to impress you  Is it that cold in the office?  That'll do it  No, it's just so  You know, I'm very manly  And I happen to have  Big pectoral muscles  That's what it is  And they're just poking through  His shirt  Yeah, but it's all about the nipple  I mean, you know  Guys, yeah  Guys have big chest  But they don't have big nipples  That look like  Wow  Girl nipples  Popping out  In front of other men  Looks like the  Farrah Fawcett poster  From the 70s  Wow  Without the blonde wig

He picked me up today, Anthony  He did?  Yeah, and he's waiting  Outside my place  With an umbrella  Oh, I know  I got the umbrella thing too  Because after he dropped you off  I guess  He parked his vehicle  In the garage  Right after I did  And I was all bundled up 
[00:37:30]  Ready for my usual walk  I look like Kenny  From South Park  I'm completely bundled up  The hood's over my head  Scarf  Even though it's not  All that cold out today  But I just  I feel I have to do that  I look at the cracks  In the sidewalk  And I just kind of  You know  Walk to work  You waddle to work  Waddle to work  And then I hear  Anthony  I'm like  And I'm like  Maybe he won't know  It's me  Maybe if I keep walking  No  He knows

[00:38:30]  When we leave  We leave tomorrow, actually  Tomorrow, yes  That's correct  And he's got everything  Said, Anthony  I mean everything  He's good at that  But he means well  And he wants to just  Keep us comfortable  To the point that  It's annoying  Oh, I know  Yeah  He's constantly there  Like I'm taking a dump  When you're calling my phone  To tell me that you're outside  And every minute  When I wake up  Is very valuable  So now I'm like  Oh, now I have to like  Stop dumping  Get up to answer the phone  Because Kenny's outside  He's a mother hen 
[00:39:00]  You really are a mother hen  I apologize  I apologize that I broke  Your rhythm  Yeah, you kind of  Messed up the rhythm  Actually  The rhythm  Got messed up  Is that what it was  Yeah  Yeah  But not to change the subject  I must compliment  Anthony on  The wonderful impression  He does of me  Oh, very good  Thank you  Coming from  You  That's a compliment  You are a great impressionist  I was always  Overwhelmed  By all your impressions  Thank you, Kenny  More of this 
[00:39:30]  Coming up on the  Opie and Anthony program  No, we're going to have fun  I know  Right  You prepared stuff too  Didn't you  Oh, I got it going on  He does  He did prepare more  Than Jim Norton usually does  So  That's not saying much  What do you kind of  Got in front of you  Without giving it away  I know you were working  On some new jokes  Yeah  Yeah  And  You want to ask me  I didn't sleep too good  Last night  You want to ask me why  I want to ask him 
[00:40:00]  Uh, Kenny  Can you say that  You want to ask me  Kenny  Um  I noticed you're looking  A little tired  Looks like you might not  Have slept well last night  Yeah  Cause my dog  Was barking all night  And wouldn't shut up  So I threw a shoe at it  It was a hush puppy  That's the joke  You were excited  You were excited to tell  On the show today  No, no 
[00:40:30]  Cause you've been  Emailing everyone all week  I got new jokes  For the show  Is that one of the ones  You just wrote  I'll give you like  A joke an hour  Oh  Alright  That's something  To look forward to  It's almost like  A radio tease  That's fair enough  How about a joke  Every half hour  That's asking a little  Too much from me  Really  Yeah  I mean I've tried  But you know  How about when you're  You know I'm big and stupid  How about when you're  Feeling the next joke  Coming on  You just do it  Okay  Whether it's now  Or maybe 20 minutes  From now  Or an hour later  Yeah you're right  You gotta feel it 
[00:41:00]  Alright  What else did you prepare  Well you know  I heard you talking  About like getting  A newsman and stuff  Yeah  So like  I got some news  Oh  He maybe  Are you auditioning  For the newsman spot  On the show  I do whatever it takes  Now Washington  Said to us  That they think  A good idea  Would be  For us to have  A news person  On the program  So that way  They can throw  The headlines out  And me and Ope  Can react to them  Unlike any other  Program you've ever  Heard on radio 
[00:41:30]  This is a completely  New and original  Idea from Washington  So we're auditioning  News people  Yeah  For something  That I'm sure  Will implement  As a lickety split  I think we have  A couple black women  Coming in today  Do we?  Yeah that'll be exciting  Wow that's really original  Speaking of black women  Yeah  I want to give a shout out  To all my newbie and friends  For black history month  Oh it is black history month  February  Very good  Do you know any?  Yeah  Oh  I'm very versatile  You have black friends?  Kenny  Yeah  Black people don't own 
[00:42:00]  XM satellite radios  Oh  Oh  Maybe they've stolen  A General Motors  Vehicle  There you go  That's what they do  They're laughing right now  Going  Ha ha  Funny white boys  Could happen  Alright well  Kenny  We're very happy  That you're sitting in today  Nobody's happier than me  And  That's for sure  Speaking of Norton  There is a huge problem  Yeah  Going on with Norton  Yeah I discovered that  Oh  Shh  Mmhmm 
[00:42:30]  Mmhmm  And  Someone has to volunteer  To tell Norton live  On the show today  Yeah  It is going to drive him nuts  He is going  First of all  He's  I don't think he's  He's going to believe anything  You know  Right  Oh he'll believe it  Wait real fast  I got to go to Pat the Trucker  Uh  Pat  Go ahead  Yeah  Yeah I'll be honest  Sir  If this club  So did Kenny's  On our day  That's kicking back  And it's for Didi  Right  Oh  Are you saying  This may be punishment  For uh 
[00:43:00]  For blowing it with Didi  I think  Extreme in this case  I think  But yeah  You know  We didn't plan it that way  But  I  I got to agree with the guy  Yes  Kenny  Being punished  Kenny could serve the purpose today  Yes  So um  Anthony  Mmhmm  You know Jimmy  I know  What is the one thing  That would drive him nuts  Well there's a lot of things  There's a lot of things  That drive Jimmy nuts  Because Jimmy's uh  Wound tight  We all know that  Jimmy's wound tight  He's very picky about certain things 
[00:43:30]  Uh  If he gets his mind set on something  Very difficult to change him  Around  He's a very strong willed person  Uh  Things that upset him  Um  Food  If his food's  Things that's food  Not right  Sure  If his food isn't right  He kind of freaks out a little  But he's not here  So  Grit his teeth  But he's not here  So the food thing  You know whatever  Not the food thing  It's something that  Will piss him off  When we call him  In Pittsburgh this morning  Well  I do know  That we're  We're traveling 
[00:44:00]  And that's usually  A big issue with him  Things like hotel rooms  Uh  Times  Uh  Things like that  I know last time  Uh  For the Vegas trip  There was problems  With the travel arrangements  And I had never seen him  So upset  Uh  As I did when I saw him  In the office  During a conference call  With Washington  About the travel arrangements  Yeah  And you guys gotta understand  Off air  Jim Norton is  Wound  Tighter than I  Yeah  Big time  And tighter than on air  Huh 
[00:44:30]  And he's wound tighter  Than he is on air  Oh way tighter  Yeah  Way tighter  And he needs everything  To you know  Go perfectly smooth for him  Everything must be  Well Anthony  Perfectly  You pretty much know  That there's a problem  With Jim Norton's travel plans  To Mardi Gras  Yeah  And when he finds out  I  Feel really sorry  For the people in Washington  That have to field his call  Oh boy  Cause now this is all stuff  That  We knew  Weeks in advance  Everything was set 
[00:45:00]  Everything was done  The rest of the show  Has their travel arrangements  But for some reason  Little Jimmy  Was overlooked  Is that what I'm led to believe  Well  Club Soda Kenny  Believe it or not  Discovered this  It was his pick up  See there's a whole thing  Going on with Washington  And Club Soda Kenny  You know  Let's just be frank  They don't like him  They don't like him in Washington  And  The deal with Club Soda Kenny  Is that he  He pretty much works for us  Yes you are  And he takes care of us 
[00:45:30]  He looks out for  What what  Well you just make us  Like a  Your number one priority  I misunderstood  Yes you are  He makes us his priority  So we know when  You know  Club Soda Kenny  Does something for us  It's going to be taken care of  We don't even question it  But with Washington  They're  They're understaffed  Basically  So there's people down there  That are doing way too much  And way too many jobs  And unfortunately  When you have that situation  Things fall through the cracks  When we travel 
[00:46:00]  We need one person  Whose sole focus  Whose sole purpose  Is to take care of this program  So kiss me  And smile for me  Tell me that you'll wait for me  Music  Hold me like you'll never let me go  Cause I'm leaving  I've been on a jet plane  All of us except  Jimmy 
[00:46:30]  All of us except  Jimmy  All of us except  Oh babe  I hate to go  Well  That's right  Jim Norton might not be in New Orleans  Everyone else is leaving  We can fade this awful song out  I should have picked jet airliner after all  Damn it  Anyway Anthony  This email from Club Soda County  Megan  That's to Megan and forward to all of us 
[00:47:00]  Which was written at midnight by the way  Just a few hours ago  Norton is not booked on a flight on Sunday  From Newark to New Orleans  Or the return from New Orleans to Newark on Wednesday  Oh my god  According to Continental  Originally there was only a 24 hour courtesy hold  Put on those flights for him  But nobody followed through on them  Uh oh  So what is that Kenny  That means that the call was made 
[00:47:30]  Yes  And then what happened  I don't like to talk bad about people  Don't talk bad about people  Somebody dropped the ball  Okay  Right  But like some arrangement was made  Yes  There was a 24 hour courtesy hold  A reservation made  And I guess maybe in XM's eyes  There was some confusion  Because Jim was already in Pittsburgh  Yeah  You know doing the improv thing  And then we were all leaving from Newark 
[00:48:00]  Doing our thing  So they assumed I guess Jimmy would drive  From Pittsburgh to New Orleans  Just somehow  That like you said  Fell through the cracks  Right  And Kenny's obsessive  Like he keeps checking over and over again  And makes sure everything is set  Right up to the moment we're leaving  Yeah  You know how  And so Kenny just casually checked in  And said uh oh  Everyone is confirmed  Except for North  Except Jimmy  You know how stupid  Kenny is  It's because his brain 
[00:48:30]  Is completely taken up  With serving us  And this program  He just doesn't do anything else  Well may I  May I tell you  Maybe a medical thing  Yes  I am the way I am  Because my brain  Is a little left of center  Alright  A little left of center  Does that count as one of your jokes  Hopefully  No that's like the truth  That's  It's not a joke  It's the truth  It's the truth  It's the truth  So 
[00:49:00]  Kenny took it upon himself  To make sure that  You know  Jim had some kind of flight  To New Orleans  So he did get Jim on another flight  If Jim is willing to take that flight  It had better be Continental  Here's the other thing  Is it Continental  We don't know  Oh no  We don't know  Because he will  Oh my god  Here's the thing  He only flies Continental  Right  And call him a diva  But he only flies first class  Just because he's a traveling comic  And it's gotten to the point 
[00:49:30]  That you know  He wants to be as comfortable as possible  As he you know  Jets across the country  That's what he does  He travels first class  He just doesn't deal with  You know  Coaching and all that  Because he flies so much  During the year  Yeah  Well  The email continues  More bad news for Jim Norton  First class is only available  Going to New Orleans  First is not available  On the return flight  Oh my god  Norton is going to lose his mind  No  You know what  I tell you  Norton will not lose his mind  Because he will not believe this 
[00:50:00]  Because of the last joke  That was played  He will insist  This is a joke  He will not believe  That this is actually the truth  He will think it's a joke  Because there's no way  After the Vegas thing  With travel  That they could have  Possibly screwed up  His travel arrangements  This time  He's not going to accept that  As the truth  Look at the nice salutation  How I ended it  On the second page  Oh  Second page  Flip that page  Opie  Read the salutation 
[00:50:30]  All right  I don't know  Oh okay  This needs immediate attention  You know  Because he discovered this  In the middle of the night  XM in Washington  Has no idea  This is going on yet  I don't know how  Anyone is going to  Justify this to Norton  That's the truth  Please call me  And let me know  That this was taken care of  If XM would allow me  To make the travel arrangements  I could take care of this  Godspeed Kenny  That's a great line Kenny  Because it's the truth  I don't know how anyone 
[00:51:00]  Is going to justify this  To Norton  Well I had justified  This screw up  And then I thought better  And took screw up out  Ah there you go  So you're getting smarter  Very good  Because they really  Are not fans of  Club soda Kenny  Down there  I know  That's why I'm going to  Win them over today  That's my goal  Good luck  All right  Good luck  He's motivated  Maybe when you talk  Talk to him  You could make sure  You're louder  Yeah  Yeah that helps  All right 
[00:51:30]  So that's  That's going on  And we've got to get  Jim Norton on the phone  He's not answering  His phone yet  Oh he's sleeping  Why would he be  Well he's got to get up  For Pittsburgh TV  And Pittsburgh Radio  In the morning  Yeah he's doing  All sorts of stuff  Down there  What time is it  Over there  We're over there  Where's Pittsburgh  Is it over or down  It's kind of over  And a little down  It's over a little down  And in the same time zone  Okay it's not that far away  No  Oh I thought it was  Pittsburgh was kind of near  Like Michigan or something  No  No  No it's 
[00:52:00]  It's relatively close  Kenny dumbs down everybody  When he comes in here  Yes  That's the truth  You notice I didn't chime in  Because I don't know  The anatomy  He doesn't know  The anatomy of the United States  Right  And I'll lay out  All the cities  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Just point me  To the right direction  The anatomy  Oh my god  It's going to be  A whole day of this  I never thought I'd say  Please bring in Voss  Alright well 
[00:52:30]  That's what's going on  Okay  Oh he is going to lose it  Who's telling him  We drawing straws  I don't know  Um  Because  I usually take pleasure  In stuff like this  No  But I don't know today  I don't know  Not this  Because it's real  Yeah  And Jimmy is not one  That takes this stuff  Well  We'll have to figure that out  Alright  Alright  Maybe we'll have Eric do it  I'll take one for the team 
[00:53:00]  Yeah  Yeah but he expects it from you  Hmm  You know what I'm missing  What  I hear you talking about  That Rump Wrangler intern  Is he here  Noah  Noah's not here today  Oh he's not in today  Rump Wrangler intern  We don't know what he does  Yeah  Yeah but I was excited  To like  Meet him  And shake his limp hand  Is that why your nips  Are popping out like that  All excited  Yeah that's why  I wore this tight shirt 
[00:53:30]  Kenny was abusing  The interns in the office  Earlier too  They'd come up  And he's like  Hi  I'm Kenny  And he'd grab their hand  And start shaking it  And I guess  Squeezing pretty hard  Well shaking it  As fast and hard as he could  Yeah  And one of the  He's a strong guy  One of the four kids  Goes like  I don't think my arm  Can handle this sir  Yeah  Gotta be cordial  Is that what he said  Yeah  I don't think my arm  Can handle this sir  He didn't know what else  To say  His little arm 
[00:54:00]  Was flapping  Ready to snap  It's so awkward  And it looks so stupid  And he doesn't stop  Doing it  Yeah  Like he'll be  And he's looking  Right in the eyes  Just like shaking  Their hand up and down  No  They're in pain  Poor little guys  Too funny  Well Jim Norton's  Not here today  And we gotta talk to him  About the flight thing  As we go to break  We'll play something off  His eat a bullet CD  Anthony  Okay  Yes  And we'll get into  The news and stuff  A lot of interesting  Things happening today  One of our heroes  Died man  Oh very famous 
[00:54:30]  I guess we shouldn't  Call him a hero  But  He's one of mine  He's been in a couple  Of my favorite movies  He's had some lines  That I've repeated  Throughout my life  And I think he's a  He was a very funny  Actor to watch  Even though I don't  Think he meant to be  Right  Well we'll talk about him  Next and the Super Bowl  And all sorts of things  So stay there  I just moved  I went through a big move  I grew up in New Jersey  I just moved into New York  Just because I had  You know  To be closer to work  Moving is so expensive  In two days  I have spent  Twelve hundred dollars 
[00:55:00]  In Bed Bath & Beyond  I love Bed Bath & Beyond  I don't know if you're aware of this  But as a man  After a thousand dollars  You get a letter  Congratulating you  On being homosexual  Towels are thirty bucks  I didn't know that  I lived at home  Until I was twenty-eight  And I moved in with people  Who had towels  Thirty bucks 
[00:55:30]  I picked up a hooker  Once for twenty  You know how annoying  That is  I could have just  Handed her a towel  And gotten change  And then killed her  And took the towel back  State of the Union

No  Ramone is not in the room  He's not my imaginary friend  It's just a character  Right  In a sweeper  But he is a character  That I created  You made him up  I made him up  So yeah  He's not  I should change the emphasis 
[00:58:00]  He's not my imaginary friend  He is my character  Your imaginary character  My imaginary character  And from me listening to these  His job description  Is getting really rank  It is  But I'm brainstorming  Trying to think of menial tasks  That Ramone can do  A menial task  And you know  Doing what Ramone has to do  Yeah  Do different things  Yeah we're going to start  From the beginning again  Because this is the third installment  Of the Ramone sweepers  It's like a series  Like the old coffee commercials  I'm getting obsessed  With the whole Ramone storyline 
[00:58:30]  I love the Ramone storyline  Ramone is a very put upon fella  Yes you feel for him  Now I hate to  We don't do this often  These days on this program  What's that?  Oh your phone  But there's a lot of new listeners  That just got their radios turned on  So really fast  Ramone works for  Ramone works  Is a manservant  Or houseboy  Right  For the deep voice guy  That voices some of the  Opie and Anthony show promo  Very wealthy  Lives in a palatial house

No no  Yeah yeah  Well the houseboy lives there  Because he lives in a  Servant's quarters  Exactly  Steve if I'm out of line  On any of this  If I'm speculating  I'm sure you have it all  Spelt out  Modest servant's quarters  Very modest servant's quarters  Right  And you know  Up very early  To take care of the master's needs  Exactly  And the master is the guy  With the really deep voice  Yeah he's got a very  But that's you  Right  Well I'm the guy  Voicing the promo  But I'm not 
[00:59:30]  In this instance  I'm not  Wow it's hard to dig myself  You're not that guy  I'm not that guy  Voicing it  I would love  I'm sorry Kenny  Yes Kenny  Ramon is a Freudian thing  With Steve  You think so?  Yeah that's my take  Is that coming out  Of the part of your mind  That's left of center?  Wherever it comes from  That's where it's been  Yeah  Put very nicely  Thanks  Thanks Kenny  So okay  So it's a character you play 
[01:00:00]  When you're doing sweepers  For the Opie and Anthony program  Thank you  And I take it  Not only is he very wealthy  But he's a bit eccentric  Yeah very eccentric  So the houseboy's there  So if this guy has some need  At 3.30 in the morning  The houseboy's not going to be sleeping  He need only clap  Or ring a bell  Oh he's got a little bell  He's got a little bell  And Ramon is at his beck and call  Wow  Alright well  Some gig  It all started with this  Oh wait  Track two  Yeah let's go two  Alright it all started with this  Ramon promo  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony 
[01:00:30]  Ooh  It's in my shoes  Ramon  Clean this up  Right  So Ramon would have to scurry over now  Exactly  And clean up the mess that he made  And why did the big voice announcer  Have liquid diarrhea  In the middle of doing a  Opie and Anthony promo  You know it's entirely possible  That he had a  A chili dog  A chili dog  A glass of warm milk  And the two just did not sit well  When he's sitting  At his console  Right 
[01:01:00]  Recording copy  And you just can't  Excuse yourself in the middle  Of a recording session  It's a little incontinent  So liquid shit  That's for Bob  Liquid shit  Was pouring out of his  Pants leg  Yeah well  To his shoes  Well his pajama leg  Let's say  Right  Because he's probably  Never really dressed  Oh that's right  Because you explained  He's so in need  That the guy doesn't even  Have to go to the studios anymore  He has a home studio  And he just gets out of bed  In his pajamas  And the checks just roll in  And the checks just roll in  Checks just roll in  So there's really no need  For traditional pants 
[01:01:30]  You can walk around  In a smoking jacket  And pajama bottoms  But if I remember now  Another installment  He does leave the house  To go on a little drive  In the country  He does  But there isn't necessarily  A need to get dressed up  In full regalia  So you think he's still  In his pajama bottoms  As he's driving  Into the country  With Ramon  Could be  He might want to put on  Some hard shoes  It's hard to get  And why was he driving  In the country  Where was he going  And why was Ramon  With him  He likes to get out  Every once in a while  Because you know  Time off  Yeah you take  You know  Hop in the Bentley  Take a nice leisurely  Drive through the 
[01:02:00]  That's what I picture too  A Bentley with the  Convertible top down  Exactly  An old fashioned  Picnic basket in the back  Exactly  And they're driving out  To the country  Where he will treat  Not even so much  Treat Ramon  But Ramon is there  Again to open  The bottle of wine  Exactly  To set the plates  Out for him  On this little picnic  He's going on  Give him a manual  Hand release  Well  Ramon  It's an option  But it's not necessarily  You know  It hasn't been divulged  Yet if Ramon  Will help him  Right  I've seen no kind  Of homosexual  Contact between these 
[01:02:30]  No  He is eccentric  Because he can afford to be  You know  Wealth can afford you  That luxury  So he's just going  For a drive in the country  I see him more  As asexual  To get away from the stress  Of voicing promos  For the Opie and Anthony  Right  Exactly  So this is the second installment  I just love  A drive in the country  Laughing with Opie and Anthony  That plane is flying awfully low  Don't you think Ramon  Ramon 
[01:03:00]  Call 911  All right  There's a couple things  I noticed in this promo  Not only  Does this voice guy  Does he have a name?  Not yet  No  You really need a name for him  We haven't established  What his name is  It's got to be something snooty  I think  All right  Well  Whatever this guy's name is  Not only does he voice the promos  For the Opie and Anthony program  It looks like he's also  A fan of the show 
[01:03:30]  When he has some leisure time  Where he's taking his ride  In the country  He's also enjoying  The Opie and Anthony program  Was he?  He was  On his  On his Skyfire  He was  He had  Or his Roadie 2  Or something  XM radio  In the car with him  And if you listen closely  You will hear a very low  In the background  Audio from the Opie and Anthony show  Are you kidding?  I picked up on that  I didn't hear that at all  Very  You want to hear it again?  Let me hear the first part  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony  I'm sorry 
[01:04:00]  Carwin  Yeah  I'm sorry  That's the incontinent  I just love a drive in the country  Laughing with Opie and Anthony  So you're just talking to Ramon  You're having a little conversation with him  You're enjoying the Opie and Anthony show  You can hear it slightly in the background  In the background  Wow  I didn't know he was a fan  I feel flattered now  Yeah  Your show is good foreplay  Ah  Alright  And then  Well now  We have the latest installment  That we heard going into break 
[01:04:30]  Here's the new one  And  Are they  What's the setting for this one?  Back at home?  No  He's in a public restroom actually  Oh  He had to venture out  He  You know  Might have gone out to  Meet his broker  You know  Right  To discuss his stocks  You know sometimes you really got to sit down  With your broker  He's eccentric  But he is a successful business  Of course  He's got a lot of money  That needs taken care of  Exactly  So he's in a public restroom  And public restrooms are  You know  Havens for all kind of deviant behavior  So Ramon does have to stand guard  That is true 
[01:05:00]  Okay  And what kind of restaurant is this?  Is it a restaurant bathroom?  Is it a  A rest area?  This happens to be  A  Like a business office  Like one of those  Like a Manhattan business office  But still  Right  You know  Because you can hear like a little music in the background  Oh  Okay  Alright  State of the Union  Gas prices going up again  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM 
[01:05:30]  Who goes the weasel  Ramon  Give me your sleeve  Alright  Listen man  Okay  He was on the ball  Reading the newspaper  Right  The headlines if you will  Yeah the headlines  Reading the paper  Took a dump  Took a dump  Poop goes the weasel  Right  And why Ramon's sleeve  Instead of the toilet paper  That might be right next to him  Because  I'm starting to think 
[01:06:00]  That this guy's a sick F  Institutional toilet paper  Is a lot  Is much  More coarse  Than  Ramon's  Silky sleeve  Yeah Ramon  You know  He's not a poorly dressed  Manservant  He wears  Silk  Silk shirts  Well he would  It would look bad  For the guy  The rich guy  If his manservant  Was walking around  Like a slob  Exactly  So he's well dressed  To make him  Not that he cares  About Ramon  But he cares about his image  And if he's walking around  With a slob  It doesn't  Bode well for him  Exactly  So Ramon is well dressed 
[01:06:30]  And silk does tend to feel  Better on the backside  Than coarse  Institutional toilet paper  Now what  Would  Let me just  Kind of go into the future  A few minutes  After this happens  What would Ramon do  With his shit stained sleeve  Does he go to the sink  And wash it  He does  He would  He would try  If it was  If it was  Too stained  To recover  The actual garment  He would throw away the garment  And Ramon does carry  A garment bag  With him at times  Filled with extra shirts  Oh for 
[01:07:00]  For the man  Right  For the man  But he's also got a few  In there for himself  In a little  Compact pocket  Just in case  Things like this happen  Or if perhaps  He gets a call  And has to find  A hotel room  And stay overnight  Right  You've got to have  As far as the moment  Ramon will also have  A change of clothing  Exactly  Very good  Like some of the proverbial  Packed suitcase  Very good  You lunatic  You're a mad person  That is creativity man  I didn't even have  That one planned  Why don't you just  Make it a short sleeve shirt 
[01:07:30]  Then  It could be  If it was a summer day  Yeah  That would be rough  It could be  But then Ramon  Would have short sleeves  Exactly  It's entirely possible  Ramon could take  The sleeve off  Yeah  Steve thank you so much  You're welcome  See you later Ramon  Yeah Ramon is  Opening the door for you  So there you go  There he goes  Martini Steve  Better known as  Ramon you dropped something  Steve the bear  And all that  And here's a little song  About that  Steve 
[01:08:00]  Steve the bear  Steve  Steve the bear  Sweet Steve the bear  Sweet face so cozy  We go back to his place  And in his cave  He shows me his flame hat  I wonder how he can wear that  Wonder how many cubs  Got caught in this bear trap  His flaming clothes  Are exotic  Homoerotic  And like Steve  It should've never 
[01:08:30]  Came out the closet  But if you wear it  The sideburn's gotta be  In good shape  Can't be a cozy bear  If your hair  Don't look great  Steve  Steve the bear  Sweet Steve  Steve the bear  Sweet Steve  Steve the bear  Sweet Steve  Steve the bear  Sweet  All right Anthony 
[01:09:00]  Moving on with the  Opie and Anthony program  That song is creepy  It really is creepy right  I  You know  Who did it  Chemistry  Yeah Chemistry  I like Chemistry and all  I like some of the other stuff  He's done  You don't like that one  I'm not a fan of Steve the bear  Why  Because it's too creepy  It's creepy  It's just something  And not creepy  And like the way  We like creepy  Right  There's just something  That annoys the living  Piss out of me  When that song is playing  I can't put my finger on it  I'd rather hear the 
[01:09:30]  God damn banana phone song  Did you say  The banana phone song  Well  As opposed to  Steve the bear  I was kind of  Like  Making that comparison  That I  I'm not a big fan of  Steve the bear  And you'd rather hear what  Well if I could just  Say  You know  Off the top of my head  Anything else  That would be annoying  That I would rather hear  It would be something like  Maybe the banana phone song  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana phone 
[01:10:00]  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana phone  Yeah  Like that  But you don't like  Steve the bear huh  Not a big fan  It's just  Something about it  It's something about  The sound of it  It annoys me  Well the banana phone song  Am I alone here?

[01:39:30]  All they do is they remove the humor from everything  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly  You're gonna need some sound advice  Talk less and suck more  From a qualified professional  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts  New from the Hiv Corporation  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook  Sensitivity training  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in  And they can tickle my bag a little  I can go  Very sensitive area

[01:41:30]  Getting ready for his interview with CringeHumor.net  His big interview  What are they interviewing him about?  There's got to be a reason  Pat does these interviews from time to time  He's picked Kenny  And they were just going to do it on the phone  But I had the displeasure of being interviewed by Pat from CringeHumor.net  With Bob Kelly  Yeah  He's the worst interviewer on the planet  So we figured it would be really good to just throw it on the radio  I think we're just  I think we're just punishing our listeners today  Is that it?  For being  With just awfulness 
[01:42:00]  Yeah  For getting  What's  D.D. thrown off our shelf  Alright  Lean forward  Oh alright  Thank you  I saw that  Thanks  Nicolette Sheridan crying on TV  And Anthony and I were commenting  Man  Why does everyone feel like they have to cry on TV?  What?  Broadcast censorship hearings?  Is that what that was?  No  Dude what is that?  Oh it's a Superbowl ad?  Holy  I thought that was real  No  That's the ad that everyone's talking about 
[01:42:30]  That's a great ad  You thought that was real?  You know  No I know you looked up  That's very funny  It's like a  Hey Donnie Deutsch  Our buddy is on the Today Show  Talking about the Superbowl ads I guess  Yeah well there's an ad  That one's great  Wow that chick was hot  It's just like the hearings we saw  Yeah  With our old boss Mel Carmisen  After the Superbowl and stuff  And he had an answer to that  All those stuffy senators right?  Yeah  And that bitch of a senator  And Paul Tagliabue was there  Everyone I'm sure has seen the video 
[01:43:00]  Well they're kind of spoofing it  For a Superbowl ad this year  That's great  They got like a scores type stripper  And a little like  Wife beater  With huge boobs  She pulls that off  And she's got like a bikini top underneath it  And she's dancing around  Inside the hearing  And they had to show some old guy  With oxygen over his mouth  Like you can't take it  Yeah the actors playing the old senators  Are pretty funny man  They're really believable you know  That's a good one  Yeah  Are they going to run that?  Because they're banning a lot of ads 
[01:43:30]  Yeah I know  That seems like one they would ban  You know  I  There's a suspicion here  I think  I think Budweiser  I think Budweiser has an ad that's banned  And I think  The one you were talking about yesterday  For the car  Oh yeah  For Lincoln  Lincoln town car right?  Has one with a priest in it  The priest is rubbing the car and stuff  He's lusting after the car  Yeah  And then the third one  Is Mickey Rooney's ass  Well that one won't air  Did you see the video of Mickey Rooney yet? 
[01:44:00]  No I haven't  See  AOL is making a huge comeback  Really?  AOL Broadband  They have all this stuff  And I was  I saw all three of those banned  Superbowl commercials on AOL  And that's when I started thinking  Wait a minute  What is going on here?  Yeah  If you're like a company like Budweiser  Or any of these other big companies  Why wouldn't  After the whole Janet Jackson thing  Why wouldn't you come up with some kind of outrageous ad  Knowing it would never air 
[01:44:30]  Right  And then you release it to the press and everybody  And say look this is an ad we wanted  But they said we couldn't air it  Next thing you know  Everyone's talking about it  All the morning shows are talking about them  And throwing them on primetime in the morning  They're showing the clips  And then AOL has it as one of the main features  And then the rest of the internet I'm sure has it as well  Because you know how that works  And so many people are being turned on to the product  Because they're checking out these quote banned ads  They play them on the news shows  On the morning news shows  And what it amounts to is  Your commercial's getting played for free 
[01:45:00]  You're not paying to have it played  Because it's controversial  Yeah  Yeah  Well the Mickey Rooney one is  He's in a steam room or something  And I forget exactly what happens  But he runs out  Oh because there's someone behind him that's sick and sneezes  Yeah  It's for that airborne stuff I guess  You know that air  Greg Brady was a spokesperson for that for a while  Yeah  And so someone sneezes  So he freaks out  And he's like  Like everyone does  When someone around you sneezes  You just don't want the flu  So he starts running out of the steam room 
[01:45:30]  And his towel gets caught  And we're supposed to see  Good old Mickey Rooney's 84 year old ass  That just has to look like a nightmare  Why would you want to see that?  This is what I want to bring up  Yes that's a nightmare of course  And they cube it out so you don't see it  Although I would have loved to see it  Just because it's a freak  Because it's a freak show  You know  I'm into the freak show thing  So  But on the front of his chest  Because he's topless or whatever  Yeah  He has a huge lump  Really?  Right about I think 
[01:46:00]  Trying to remember now  But right about where the heart would be  Whoa  And I'm wondering if he had one of these bizarre procedures  Maybe he did  Or is it  Or it might be a huge pacemaker or something  Some oldie time pacemaker  But there's a huge lump in the front of his chest  Okay  That obviously should not be there  And one of these morning shows  They're all the same to me  Even though they brag about their ratings  They're the same exact format  You know  Format  One of them was interviewing Mickey Rooney and his wife  Because his wife has to do all the interviews with him now  Because he's so old  And she wants FaceTime and all that 
[01:46:30]  Great  And I'm thinking  Why didn't they ask Mickey Rooney  What the hell is that lump on the front of his chest?  You don't ask people things like that  Dude if you're in a commercial  And you're  You know  Had no shirt on  And you're already talking about  Why they're not showing it  Because of the ass  You have to bring up the obvious  I don't understand why they don't bring up the obvious  Like Mickey are you okay  There's something  That seems like something's going on  In the front of your chest  They would never ask that  On those morning shows  Never  I understand that  Meanwhile everybody would be looking at it  Going  Oh my god what is that  But they would never ask that question 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  And so  They had Mickey Rooney on  And I don't know  He's looking and acting  Just like his character from Bill  Like oh Bill  I want chicken  Where's my buddy  Is he actually talking like that?  I gotta see the clip  It's uh  He's a little slow  A little slow  I mean he's 84 and all that  But  The gravelly old man voice  He's a little slow  And everyone's like  Doesn't he look great?  No  No one looks great at 84  Let's stop with that whole  Old age thing  Where look at 
[01:47:30]  Look at  Doesn't grandma look wonderful?  No she doesn't  I mean I'm happy she's still alive  And all that  But let's stop with that crap  People are just  Pieces of fruit in the fruit bowl  I think uh  Time goes by  You just rot  I think it was Diane Sawyer  She's like  Mickey you still got it  Cause he was saying something  You know stupid  And  You know  He doesn't got it  You know what I was watching last night?  Much to my horror  The Happy Days Reunion Opie  You saw it?  30 years anniversary 
[01:48:00]  The Happy Days  It was  An abomination  They parade everyone out  And all you're doing  How do you put somebody  In a room  All these people in a room  And then show clips  Of what you look like  30 years prior  And then switch back to them  It's the shock  The shock of looking at these people  Is it another one of those clip shows?  Basically  Yeah  Big clip show  And then they showed  Oh so it wasn't an actual episode 
[01:48:30]  They were just sitting around talking  And going  Remember when  Clip show  Remember when  I came up with  Sit on it Potsy  Yes  There you go  Really?  Dude  I swear I didn't see it  You're kidding?  This is what they were talking about  Because I know the show  Is known for being  A catchphrase type show  Catchphrase  Because Gary Marshall  Who threw the show together  That everyone was praising  As a genius last night  Was the biggest sitcom hack  I've ever seen  Hack  Can I go backwards? 
[01:49:00]  You know I have a problem  Concentrating  Oh yeah  But this guy's pretty damn funny  Jim and PA  Go ahead real fast  What's going on?  Hold on  Damn it  Gotta fix that  Jim  Jim start over again  What's up?  The unit in Rudy's chest  I kind of think that's like  The big doggy unit  Of a pacemaker  Check it out guys  Oh he had such a good line  I know  It blows it  It was much funnier  Reading it on the screen  Yeah  And it's all about timing  God his delivery stunk too  And the board  I gotta talk to Jaime 
[01:49:30]  The board has to be  Reconfigured a little bit  Because when we go to CD2  Then that takes out the telephone  And if I don't have the other telephone  Hooked up  Because I don't  Because I got my instant replay  On that pot  Then it gets all messy  And weird  They're gonna work on that though  We talked about that  No I know  I mean we don't have any problems  With the guys in Washington anymore  They're doing a great job  The guy blew the line  The doggy unit pacemaker thing  Well we said there's a big lump  In the front of Mickey Rooney's chest  And this guy said  It might be one of those  Portable units  From the little doggy company 
[01:50:00]  It's serious  Is my fight  Equivalent  Yeah  You gotta implant it in your chest  Yeah  That's how you have to listen  To their crap  A surgical procedure  Great  Yeah so I'm watching that last night  Right  And they show  Gary Marshall  God  Do we have audio of this?  I don't know  Do we?  Do we have any audio?  Oh my gosh  It was really awful  Alright guys  Alright guys  Now I hope he's gonna yell at you  No I'm not gonna yell at anyone  I have completely given up  On  On  On some of the stuff  That we need for this program

[01:51:30]  Damone  Get me my audio  That's all I'm saying  That's all I'm trying to say  You know  You know how cool  It would have been  To have the audio  Of Chachi  Explaining how he  Came up with  Wah wah wah  Fascinating stuff  Wasn't he supposed  To say what  How do you know  So much about this  I don't know  Happy days was kind of  I don't know  I liked it growing up  He's like  Yeah he was saying 
[01:52:00]  That it was  What what what  And somehow  It got mutated  Into wah wah wah  And I was ready  To laugh at him  Until I started thinking  Of ap ap and ak ak  For the Opie and Anthony show  I know  It's the same way  Those things get rolling  Alright Steve does have  Some audio  And he's cutting it up  So hopefully  We'll have that  By Tuesday  I'm just kidding  These guys do work  Really hard for us  The thing was  Tom Bosley  Came out also  And he's very  Very old now  And he just looked  Like you know  Like hell  He's got the big  Basset hound eyes  The old guys get  Where it just hangs down 
[01:52:30]  And it's all red  In there and watery  I saw a clip  Of Potsy  In the preview  Potsy Weber  Yes  And I'm not one  For any like  Face crap  On anybody  Uh huh  But did you see  What was going on  Under his eyes  Yeah  It was like  The biggest bags  And you know  And you're sitting there  And seeing yourself young  That's got to  Just drive you nuts  Like you were saying  That's why these people  Don't want to  You know  Don't want to do  These things  Erin Moran  Oh my god

[01:54:00]  Gary Marshall  Saying  A show  Needs a catchphrase  And  And it's  Everything awful  About sitcoms  Came from that guy  All the  Hack  Crap  That you see on sitcoms  That they're still doing  All came from  Gary Marshall  Well he was  Quite successful  I know  But it's  Catering  To morons  I'll tell you  When happy days  Was good  And it was  Before the  Jump the shark  Episode  Happy days  Was good  Right up until  They went in front  Of a live studio  Audience  They did it 
[01:54:30]  On film  It was one camera  It had a very  American graffiti  Look to it  You know  The 50's  The props  Were very authentic  Looking  The locations  It wasn't just  Arnold  The Cunningham house  Fonzie's  You know  Apartment thing  It was all  Different real  Locations  Done on film  There was no  I don't believe  There was a laugh track  I don't  Oh yeah there was  Was there  Because it was that  The weird laugh track 
[01:55:00]  That you get in the  Old sitcom  Yeah  I can't remember  But that was cool  They covered like  Subjects of Richie  And the guys  Getting into the  Titty bar  Remember that one  And it turned out  Not being cool  Because they thought  She was going to  Take it all off  And she was just  Kind of a burlesque  Dancer  And it was the myth  Of going into a  Strip club before  You could get in  Legally  You want a morbid  Thought about  Laugh tracks Anthony  Yes  When you watch  These old sitcoms  Give me an old sitcom  You gotta go old  I love Lucy  Or the  Let's go honeymooners  Honeymooners 
[01:55:30]  Sure  All the people  Laughing on the laugh track  Yeah  Are now dead  Most likely  All of them  Dead  Dead  How does that  Make you feel  I like when  You know  You know  I used to like  Watching that  Groucho Marx show  You bet your life  You bet your life  How we doing  Ladies and gentlemen  And they would  Show the audience  They panned the audience  And they already  Looked old  I remember that  Oh she didn't even  Make it to the Korean War  She didn't even 
[01:56:00]  Forget about it  She doesn't even  Know who Kennedy is  You just look  At dead people  Yeah but everyone  Just looked old  Ancient  Back then  Uh huh  They just  I mean I bet you  If you got some  Of their ages  It's like  Oh she's 45  You know  Meanwhile she looks 70  Yeah  Probably Gwendolyn  Back to happy days  Go ahead  So  Yeah  Gary Marshall  Just the biggest hack  And one thing  They said  They made  They made Chachi  Tie that ridiculous  Bandana around his leg  Just to see if it  Would catch on  Just to see if it  Would catch on 
[01:56:30]  Did it  No  It was one of those  Things that just  Like failed miserably  Then they were showing  Leather Tuscadero  Doing her  Hit the leg  Make the little  Pistol  I was cringing  Watching this  Just horrible  The show was awful  Well the show  Was really good  When it first started  Like I said  Good storylines  And yeah  But then yeah  It all became a catchphrase  And how someone  Entered the room  And the applause breaks  Hey Cunningham  And then he'd have to stop 
[01:57:00]  And like  Kind of shift on his hip  And make the annoyed look  At Cunningham  Just kind of stretch it  Until the applause stop  And then he'd start over again  Hey Cunningham  Awful  Did they bring back Chuck  For the reunion special  Yeah  They brought back  Both Chucks  At the end of the show  Just to deliver the cake  For the big  It says big happy  Days  Wait they had two Chucks  There was two Chucks  I didn't even know  There were two Chucks  The older brother  That all of a sudden  Just disappeared 
[01:57:30]  And they never explained  Really  He went off to Nam  I think  Chuck from Love American style  And then there was  Chuck from the early happy days  How did they look  They looked older  Than the rest of the cast  Because he was the older brother  Right  Yeah  And did they ever explain  Why the whole set  Or the house changed  But they never moved  No they didn't  Just a picky little thing  When I'm watching my sitcoms  Yeah  Then they  They had a reunion softball game  Apparently  Way back in the day  When happy days was on  It was a huge thing  They had a softball team 
[01:58:00]  Happy days softball team  And they traveled  All over the globe  Playing softball for charity  They did it for the USO  They went to Guam  They went to Japan  All over the United States  They play in every major ball field  Playing against other teams  For charity  And they got pretty good at it  I guess  Well they decided  It would be a great thing  For them to all get together  And play a 30th anniversary  Softball game  Oh they parade these people  They're old men  They're old men now 
[01:58:30]  Getting out there  And just looking  Like maybe you shouldn't  Be doing this  You could break a hip  And Tom Bosley  Had to call the game  He couldn't even play  He's just sitting there  Just deteriorating away  And who the hell  Wants to sit there  And watch  The happy days  Old happy days cast  Play softball  And old Fonzie  Was he  Was he  Old Fonzie played  No I know  But during the reunion  Was he doing some of his  Fonzie-isms 
[01:59:00]  Because that had to look  No  No  I think he's really  Tried to get away  From the Fonzie thing  Even though I think  He embraces it  For shows like this  I don't think you'll ever  See him doing the catchphrases  Or anything like that  He should never get away  From it  I know he's  He's been successful  I think directing  A little bit  And producing  But he'll always be  Known as Fonzie  No matter what he does  Biggest cringe moment  Of the night  And could be the  Biggest cringe moment  In television history  The Do the Fonzie  Dance  That I believe  Was it  Leather Tuscadero  Was playing  And they 
[01:59:30]  It was  The song is called  Do the Fonzie  And Fonzie  And Fonzie  Was doing his dance  Which consisted of him  Dancing and doing  His thumbs up thing  Like  I  I can't even describe it  I'm cringing  Thinking about it  It is so bad  Hey  Yeah  He'd put his thumbs up  And do a little dance  Moving his thumbs around  Pull him back  Towards his arms  He'd pull him back  Yeah  He'd stick his thumbs out  Forward  And then pull him back  By the side of his head  I'm cringing  Thinking about it 
[02:00:00]  I'm dirty  And then they cut right  To when he's doing  The Russian dancing  During the dance contest  Remember the one  From the Weezer  From the Weezer video  Of course  And he's doing  The Russian dance  Just the worst show  That deteriorated  From a cool show  About being young  In the 50s  To just this  Maudlin crap  Every episode  Was a very special episode  They had everyone  Singing  Joni and Chachi  Singing  Ugh  With the bad  80s  Disco 
[02:00:30]  Type  Lighting  Behind him  I'll tell you  One thing  Scott Baio  Is probably  One of the  Best actors  Of our time  Really  Because he had to  Make believe  He was in love  With Joni  That mess  While he was  Banging  Every  Oh while he was  Banging  Pam Anderson  He was the first  To soil her  Nicole Eggert  He's banging her  And he's got to  Look at  Joni  He's banging the  Hottest blondes  In Hollywood  But no one  Gets to see that  They get to see  Him on TV 
[02:01:00]  Falling in love  With this mess  This mess  That he wouldn't  Even give a  Look at  On Sunset Boulevard  There in Hollywood  You know what I mean  Exactly  That had to suck  Because all his friends  Saw you know  Pam Anderson  Go into his pad  Or whatever  Yeah  You know  Didn't know him for that  To ruin his image  Why don't you  And Joni  Go out  To dinner tonight  So people think  You're really dating  Yeah  Gary Marshall  Probably told him  Hey kids  Go out  Have fun 
[02:01:30]  With each other  It's a good image  For the show  Because Joni  Loves Chachi  All of America  Believe  Because you know  People are stupid  Especially in middle America  No offense to you guys  But you're stupid  There's a lot of dummies  In your area  I'm sure they really  Believe that they were  Really in love  In real life  No no no  He was banging  The hottest  Hottest starlets  In Hollywood  Did you see  How they ended the show  No  It actually turned  By that point  Yeah  Ron Howard and  Henry Winkler  Are the last to leave 
[02:02:00]  And you know  It's all that  Emotional music  And they're looking  Around Arnold's  And Ron goes  Hey Henry  Why don't you just  Do it one more time  For old times sake  And Henry's like  I can't do that  Dude I got chills  And I don't even know  What's going to happen  I just had chills  On the back of my neck  Go ahead  So Henry goes  I don't know  If I can still do that  And he's like  Come on  Just one more time  For old times sake  So Henry goes  He looks at the wall  Takes his fist  To hit the wall  To turn the lights  Out in Arnold's  But he barely  Hit the wall  It's like  You don't even hear  A  Yeah  When he hits the wall  It's like  He scrapes the wall 
[02:02:30]  And the lights  Just go out  Big applause  Oh wow  That's fantastic  What a way to end it  Yee  Alright  Woo  You know  Eric has  It's just an amazing  An amazing collection  Of audio  You don't happen to have  The family guy  Where they mention Fonzie  You might really  Putting him on the spot  Family guy  Just you know  Obviously spoofs a lot  Of old TV  And stuff  Family guy is hysterical  And they have a clip 
[02:03:00]  That involves Fonzie  That's really funny  Alright  Why don't we take a break  Alrighty  Still to come  We gotta give Jim Norton  The bad news  About his  Well he might be listening now  So we just got some  Bad news for him  Nothing bad  If you're just tuning in  But it'll just piss him off  And Club Soda Kenny  Is filling in for Jim Norton today  He'll be back in studio  For his big interview  With CringeHumor.net  Yeah  Another website  That's really good  And supports the radio show  So that should be  Very interesting  To eavesdrop in

[02:07:30]  Because when I walk out of here  The delay  Then she'll hear it  And then look at me  Why did I say that?  I didn't say anything  I just didn't know where the girl was  Okay  Saw a few people out there  And I was wondering where the girl was  That's all  That's all I'm trying to say  If you think about it really  That's all I'm trying to say  Mark Patrick  Hi, Tom Bosley  Ooh  Hey, Tom  Did you watch that Happy Days thing?  You know, I saw like the last  Ten minutes of it  Yeah  And you guys had the end of the deal down perfect 
[02:08:00]  With  And was it just  A heartwarming exit  Was it just cringy?  Yeah  You know, a lot of that stuff  I don't want to see the reunion special  No  It just seems like there's a better way to do it  Where everyone just  I don't know  Still has their dignity  You know  Like I  There's probably  If I had to have my top three shows of all time  The Dick Van Dyke show  The original  The Dick Van Dyke show is one of them  That's a good one  Did you see the god awful reunion they had about a year ago?  No 
[02:08:30]  Oh, that must really be bad  Oh man, it was painful  And they came up with some convoluted way  Of getting everybody together  Yeah, it was for  They had to write the obituary for one of their friends or something?  I think for Alan Brady  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Great  Yeah  And then  Rosemary  Rosemary is still alive  How is that even possible?  You know, it defies nature, doesn't it?  Did  What did they say about Maury Amsterdam? 
[02:09:00]  I think he's gone up to the  He's sniffing the big pickles in the sky  Yeah, yeah  But what did they say?  Did they  Did they address that on the show?  Or did they say he was out of town?  I don't remember  He was just like  I just want to remember Mary Tyler Moore  And those little pants  You know  Those little capri pants  Those are so unsexy  She's got  Now she's got that  That Botoxed mouth  You know  And all that stuff  And she looks like Sherry Lewis  Oh, wow 
[02:09:30]  That's good  She's just scary to look at now  Absolutely scary to look at  I don't know  See, I want to remember them  Like they were in Black and White  And that's the deal with Happy Days  It's like  I don't see Henry Winkler  With all gray hair  Yeah  Yeah, what happened to the Fonz's  Greased back black hair?  There's just got to be a way to do it  I think they should have just sat there  And goofed on each other  Like, oh, look at you  Doing your catchphrase  Or look how young  I don't know  Something, you know  Yeah  But they just take it  Way too serious and stuff 
[02:10:00]  And then they look weird  Because they're so much older now  And I don't know  Did Dick Van Dyke  My favorite thing is  Like they're breaking down  The Ten Commandments  With Cecil B. DeMille  Right  And Mark  Which also had the worst  Capping of all time  For a movie  No, I'm not going to say it now  Why?  Because it got stepped on  Too many times  What were you going to say?  Nothing  Nothing  Nothing  And I  I decline to even say it now  My little Dick Van Dyke thing  Was it good? 
[02:10:30]  Might have been  But now it's gone  Now it's gone  Now it's gone  All right  It's because Mark Patrick doesn't listen  Mark, you listening?  You know what?  I have a really hard time hearing you guys  So I apologize for that  What?  Can you hear now?  A little bit  Can you hear me now?  Okay, now that I'm turned this way  I got you  Can you hear me now?  All right, Mark  Super Bowl  Pats favored by seven  Still going with the Pats?  Yeah  By seven, huh?  I can't  You know, since I picked them 
[02:11:00]  What, three weeks ago  I can't not take them now, right?  Yeah, that's true  Well, I mean  There's some controversy though  Tom Brady's grandmother died  Is that going to affect his performance on Sunday?  I don't know  My grandmother died  And it wasn't that big a deal  Wow  Hey, you're telling it like it is, you know?  Some people  Yeah, I mean, really  I think it's a little tough  My grandmother was 92  His is 94  I just can't believe that it's that big a deal  That it's blowing the Super Bowl big, yeah 
[02:11:30]  You know  I mean, had this happened in week three  Would we be talking about his grandmother dying?  True, true  Well, it might be  Probably not  I'm thinking it might be slightly tougher for the aunts and uncles  Than the grandkid, right?  Well, you know, I guess his dad was still very close with her  Right  But I mean, she was in a nursing home  Well, she lived a fine life  Well, you know, but the press has to make a big deal out of it  You know, 94 is a great life  I would take that any day 
[02:12:00]  Any day  Yeah, believe me  These guys are all down there just looking for any story they can conjure up  Right  Yeah, and they're running out  And this is the only thing that's coming out of the Patriots camp  Because Terrell Owens is all over everything else  Yeah, well, that's why the Pats are going to win the Super Bowl  And a lot of Eagles fans email me and just yelling and screaming at me  All pissed off  But I don't know  I just see the Pats as more of a team  And the Eagles, all the attention is on Terrell Owens instead of the team 
[02:12:30]  Terrell Owens, who is now saying that God told them to play more or less  Even though the doctors told him he shouldn't be doing anything on that ankle, right?  See, if God was really an Eagles fan  Would they have not at least won the NFC the last couple of years?  Yeah, exactly  Yeah, all of a sudden God's like a fan out of nowhere?  I just love the whole God thing and sports  You know, like God really is  Hey, fellas, listen, got the big Super Bowl party 
[02:13:00]  This, my son's coming over, bringing the stuff  What do you think?  Jesus comes over, brings some wine  Sure  Well, it's water until he gets there  Yeah, enough with the God and sports thing, you know  I think there's a lot of guys on the other team that lost the Super Bowl  That also believe in God and was hoping God was going to help them as well  And I think God is busy showing his power in other ways 
[02:13:30]  Than I think Terrell Owens said this is God's way of showing how great he is  Or something like that  By making me play in the Super Bowl  I think God showed his power recently with the whole tsunami thing  So you're saying the Eagles are going to get hit with a tsunami?  That's probably a little bit more accurate  Yeah  I don't remember any of those home videos that we saw all over the network newscast  Of people pointing toward the sky  When they were getting carried away  Oh, wow  You're a shock jock  Thanks to the big guy upstairs 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, you're being a little shocking  Are you in Jacksonville, Mark?  No, I am in the nation's capital  Oh, okay, you're down in the, you're at the compound  Are you going to go for the big game?  No  No?  I think I'm going to go to my basement and watch it on the big screen  Yeah, I think it's a lot more fun to watch the Super Bowl at home, don't you think?  It really is  You know, having been to the Super Bowl, it's such a mess  In what way?  It's just, it's almost like the game is secondary  Oh yeah, we've said that for years 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I mean  It's almost like, oh yeah  It's almost like, oh yeah, that's right, there's actually a game going on  You know, between all the stupid things they do  They make a big deal just out of the coin toss and this  And then halftime is now, you know, an hour and a half long or whatever it is  And yeah, you're right  And then, oh yeah, that's right  In between the fireworks and stuff, there is a game going on  There's a game being played  You're 100% right  Paul McCartney had a press conference yesterday  When's the last time the halftime show had a press conference?  Yeah  Well, that's because of what happened last year 
[02:15:00]  And then he got up there and he had to be all hokey  And don't worry about me  I don't think there'll be a warbird malfunction this year  Yeah, thanks  Yeah, no one wants to see anything that Paul McCartney has on his batte  I hear it's really a clusterfuck down there this year  As far as hotel rooms go and transportation  There's not enough cabs  The city is so spread out, Jacksonville, that nobody can stay together 
[02:15:30]  And it's, the closest place is like an hour drive to the stadium  Yeah, I just can't imagine  What a mess that must be  I mean, I've just, you know, having just been in Jacksonville for regular games  It's not easy  Yeah, why did they pick Jacksonville?  Um, you know, I don't know  It's all financial  I don't remember what Jacksonville's hope it was  Yeah, well, I mean  The real mess is going to be Detroit next year  Well, can you imagine? 
[02:16:00]  Well, yeah, I mean  A lot of people have to, you know  Stay on cruise ships and stuff  Because they don't have enough hotel rooms  Yeah, they have to pull up cruise ships  Sounds like that would be kind of fun  But also a hassle  Have you guys ever been on a cruise?  Anthony  Yeah, yeah  You know, I don't know about you, Anthony  But it was like the worst room I've ever seen in my life  Really? What did you, where did you, what room did you stay in, you cheapo? 
[02:16:30]  Well, no, it was my honeymoon  And we go into the room  This is my honeymoon  I didn't want to do it  Because I was like, man  You know, why do I want to get seasick for a week on what's supposed to be my honeymoon?  Yeah, you really got to watch yourself  Is it that bad?  Is it that bad on those big cruise ships?  Oh, there's some  I mean, the bed wasn't even big enough for me to lay down in  Did you, did your room, let me just ask you this  Did your room have a balcony?  No  Did you have a round porthole on the side, on a wall? 
[02:17:00]  No  No? It wasn't, you had no window?  No  You had an inside, okay, I know what this guy had  This guy had an inside room, which is, you know, the inside part of the ship  Probably, was it lower down in the ship?  Yeah  Yeah, it's very far down in the ship  And that's where  You can actually hear the bilge pump when you try to sleep  And that's where you get seasick the most, right?  No, some people say up top  I think what made me the most sick is we had to bunk with three waiters 
[02:17:30]  Ba-dum-bum  Damn, I wish I had that crash  Yeah, thank you, Opie  No, the guy, I mean, the guy, I sit there, I go, you know, I'm telling my wife, I go, oh, no, there's a mistake, look at this  So I go and I find the guy who's like the gopher guy, right?  It's a gopher from the Lubbock  And I said, look, we've got, you know, my wife upgraded and everything  I said, this, we're in the wrong room  And then he opens the door to show me what we would have had had we not upgraded  Oh, you were upgraded  I'm like, oh, my God  Get what you pay for on a cruise ship 
[02:18:00]  No kidding  Is what the deal is  If you go in there trying to get a discount vacation on a cruise ship, you're screwed  Because you will get a shoebox  And the lucky people get the porthole so you can get a little fresh air in there  But you've got to pay through the nose  And then you get on the upper decks, you get the big suite with a balcony over the side  It's great  When you're getting paid to not do radio for a couple of years, you figure these things out 
[02:18:30]  See, I was getting paid to do really bad radio at the time  It's like 20 years ago  Yeah  Oh, 20 years?  Was it really 20 years ago?  Yeah  Yeah, see, they've changed, too  The cruise ships now, the ones they're building now are amazing  Like, even the bad rooms are pretty good  And you don't get as sick because there's all kinds of stabilization equipment on there  It's pretty cool  Maybe you ought to try it again, Mark  Well, see, this is what this was supposed to be  I got this whole spiel from my wife 
[02:19:00]  That this, you know, they had the stabilization  And da-da-da-da-da  And the first night at dinner, I look over and she's some sort of shade of gray  You got to take your Dramamine  Well, she did  And we both had the little pats behind our ear and everything  How miserable were you guys by the end of it?  Oh, I was ready, you know, I was ready to kill her  Yeah, that's the worst  Was Leslie Nielsen your captain 20 years ago?  You know, it was actually uphill from there, so that's good 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  All right, Mark  One of these days, I'll tell you the story about the guy with no legs  That sang at the talent contest  On the ship?  Yeah  Guy with no legs singing at the talent contest  You get the best  How's that for a radio tease?  You get the best entertainment on cruise ships  Should we get the story now or another time?  No, I mean, I got time  I mean, I got time, you got time  You piqued my curiosity  All right, let's hear the story  All right, well, you know how when you're, like, stuck somewhere 
[02:20:00]  You always see, like, the same person  You don't know who they are  Yeah  But you kind of, you run into them all the time  Sure  Well, this guy  So, you know, you're on a cruise ship for a week  And I keep seeing this guy  And he's odd because he's wearing blue jeans and cowboy boots  Now, why would you do this on a ship?  You know, this is a Caribbean cruise  Yeah  So, you know, people run around in shorts and stuff  So, it's like, why is this guy wearing  And I'd always get behind him 
[02:20:30]  You know how the, like, the stairways  Going from one deck to the other are very thin  Well, on your deck, it probably was very thin  I had the palatial, like, the Titanic  Like, the great entranceway in the Titanic  That's what, was every staircase by my room  So, I'd get behind this guy, you know  And he always kind of walked  He always, like, was walking weird and stuff  So, I, you know, I  It was just such a miserable  It rained the whole time 
[02:21:00]  It was the most miserable week of my life  And I keep running into this guy  And he has on, like, the same pair of jeans  And they're like the jeans that you buy at truck stops  Yeah  Those ones that have the extra big ass for the truck drivers  Like Steve wears  Yeah  Truck stop jeans  You know, we, I keep, you go to the buffet  And this guy would grab, like, the last piece of pie I wanted  And I go, you know, it's 90 degrees  And there's this guy walking around 
[02:21:30]  And he's like, keep running into it  So, we get to the last night  And there's absolutely nothing to do on this ship  So, they have the talent show for people that are passengers  All right, this is where the story should have began, by the way  Yeah, we know how it ends  You blew it by saying the guy with no legs story  So, the story should have began  So, the whole mystery of why he was walking weird  Why he was wearing pants  It kind of, it kind of loses something here 
[02:22:00]  The story should have began  The last night on the cruise  We went to the talent conference  Jesus, Mark  Wow, Mark  All right, well, we're with you still  That's why I don't get paid to not be on  All right, go ahead  So, are you finally sitting at the talent show?  I think that I really  Or is your wife at the bar getting your drinks?  I still feel good about the story  I really do  I still think  All right  Are we settled down in our seats at this point?  I had forgotten my pocket watch  So, I went back to the room  Holy hell 
[02:22:30]  Damn telling me  That's like Gary Marshall  All right  So, where's the wife right now?  She's sitting  So, she's with me  And we are at this point of the cruise  In the tight-lipped state  Okay  Where you barely say  Are you ready?  You know, when you're going somewhere  Right  Because we're just being civil  Because this whole cruise idea  I am so right  That the whole thing has gone down the toilet  And she knows I'm right  Okay  So, we go to this stupid talent show  We're sitting there  And we go through  And you get these 
[02:23:00]  You know, these old women  That are doing their  You know, threesome singing  And all this crap  And it's just the worst thing you can imagine  How many knots was the ship doing at this point, Mark?  See, it's Mark  How many knots?  Was it about maybe  Are you  Are you  Fifteen?  Yeah, we'll go with that  All right  Are you still feeling good about the story?  I'm feeling good about it  So, this guy goes up last  And I finally say to my wife 
[02:23:30]  I say, oh my God  There's that guy I keep running into  Oh, nice  Sorry  Thank you  Go ahead  So, he sits up there  And he pulls his  He goes  I'd like my wife, Leticia, to stand up  And I want everybody to know how much I love her  We are on our honeymoon  It was two years ago this week  That I was driving down Interstate 65 
[02:24:00]  In Lexington, Kentucky  In a hard rainstorm  And I saw a car pull over with a flat tire  And I pulled over  He's telling this guy's long story  During his long story  I know, this is just amazing  I asked you guys if you wanted to hear this story  Well, and we said yes  And you said yes  You speak my interest  By the way, you know  When you're telling these little stories  Here's a good idea  Have a point  It makes it so much more interesting  For the listener  Well, I'm interested though 
[02:24:30]  All right  The guy's talking about his  I guess how he met his wife  And there's a car with a flat tire  All right  Flat tire  He got the flat tire  He got out  And he was a good Samaritan  I got out  I changed the tire  At that point  A semi  Blinded by the rain  Ram the back of my pickup  That's terrific  That's terrific  Shoving it  Into the back of her car 
[02:25:00]  With me in between  And severing my legs at the knee  Now, it was at this point  That the guy took  You know, pulls up his jeans  And takes off  Both of his artificial legs  From the knee down  And then brings her on stage  And sings  Feelings  All right  I am with you  I am laughing so hard  That I'm ready to throw up  Hello, exactly 
[02:25:30]  Hello, exactly  Were you openly laughing though?  I know  I know  What you guys want to say is  I had you at the honeymoon  Didn't I?  Yeah  Oh, I  It was one of the deals  Where you're laughing at a funeral  You know, you're  You can't  Everyone  Say  I'm your foghorn  Boring  Wow  Thank you  What the hell are you talking about?  What the hell are you talking about? 
[02:26:00]  I must go on record  And say this is not a boring story, Derek  If you ran that one into the ground  No, he did run the story into the ground  I thought it was a nice little story  And he took off his legs  You know, I had  Had I not been forced to give the punchline before the story  That's true  I believe  That you would have been mesmerized  Yeah, it's very tough to work backwards  When you're telling those types of words  It is, and that's why I said that with the tease 
[02:26:30]  And then you forced me to go ahead with the story  So I really  I look at myself as blameless here  Well, duh  All right, Mark  Very good  Thank you, Mark  For checking in once again with us  And I don't know  Maybe we'll call you from New Orleans  Yeah, have a good time down there  Yeah, we might call you  You know, if you do  I promise  Either a better story  Or no story at all  No, that's  I like the story  I'm going on record  You like the no-leg  Yes, I did 
[02:27:00]  I don't think you guys should have abused him as much as you did  I appreciate the love and support  All right, Mark  From one side of the room  To the other  All right, I hear you  From the other  You know, again  I'm going to get an attorney  All right  All right, Mark Patrick, everyone  Thanks, Mark  Always have a great time down there  If I don't talk to you  All right, cool  There he goes, Mark Patrick  Oh, is that funny  It was a story within a story  He's telling the guy's long-winded story 
[02:27:30]  During a long-winded story  Sorry, yeah  Shut up!  All right, you want to take a very quick break?  Quiet  We got the Happy Days audio you were talking about, Anthony  We got the audio of Nicolette Sheridan crying  Because we don't understand why everyone has to cry on TV  Yeah, they get on there and they do these interviews  And stop blubbering  Maybe we should play Patsy Cline  And then play the Emmett Smith crying  Into the Nicolette Sheridan crying  Patsy Cline?  Patsy, no?  Do we?  I don't know what that is 
[02:28:00]  Crying  Oh, right, I got you  That song  Is that Patsy Cline?  Yeah, I think it is  All right, why don't we take a very quick break here  Or whatever they want to do in the other room  And we'll continue  Lots going on outside the studio  We got to get some of these people in here  As you grow this effing show  There are four words that you must know  Learn to punch  I'm punchin' out  I'm punchin' out  Punchin' out  Punchin' out  You guys are great  Hey, you ever knew that's angry?  Where are you going on? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, well  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  Sitting in for Jim Norton today  Club Soda Kenny  He's back in the studio  He had a rest after his amazing appearance about an hour ago 
[02:29:00]  He did the news for us  Such a prima donna  We felt like he just needed to rest though, Anthony  He used a lot of energy in that newscast  Yes, Kenny  I just want to remind everybody how terrific you guys are  It's not easy to do a four-hour show of the caliber that you do every day  Day in and day out of the month  Of the month?  Of the month  All right, very good  Did you see the Happy Days reunion last night, Kenny? 
[02:29:30]  I saw something about Fonzie and  That would have been it then  Yeah, I didn't see the whole thing  No, they were like  Fonzie on any other thing  Yeah, no, they were talking to him on one of those MSNBC shows  Or Fox  Yeah, Fox and Friends  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, and they were like  Doing Fonzie trivia with the Fonzie  Oh, wow  And he didn't know his own real  His middle name  On the show?  Yeah, they stumped him 
[02:30:00]  What is it?  It was like  Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli  Oh, yeah?  Was it Herbert though?  I think if my memory is correct  All right, very good  Well, Anthony was talking about  The catchphrases on Happy Days  Oh, yes  We got the clip  Because that show turned into  One big catchphrase after another  One long catchphrase factory  I'm thinking that we need  More catchphrases on our show  You think so?  Catchphrases from our show  Don't we have a few?  Just a few  Your mom's box? 
[02:30:30]  Your mom's box is a very popular one  Okay, terrific  Okay, terrific, sure  We don't have any new ones though, do we?  No  Well, yeah  Shit dick  The song the girl sang yesterday  The  The  Clits of my tits  The clits of my tits  That is not a catchphrase for this program  All right, cool  Here's them talking about catchphrases last night  I said we need some catchphrases  Eee 
[02:31:00]  He's like, yes, the writers  And they sent me a list every week  And I said, sit on it's not bad  Let's try that  Oh, sit on it, Potsy  Sit on it, Molly  Sit on it, Potsy  Hey  Oh, Howard  What am I going to do with this?  Knit on it, Marion  You can have other catchphrases  Well, I'll tell you something, buckles  I still got it  I was the first one to say nerd on TV 
[02:31:30]  Wow  Gee, Potsy  You should act this nice all the time  Them people wouldn't think you're such a nerd  I'm not a nerd  I'm not a prude  I'm not a nerd  Where is that woman?  Well, she's proud that she was the first one to say the word nerd on TV  They all have this thing where, yeah  Maybe it wasn't really a word yet  And that's why no one else used it  Oh, wow  This is awful stuff  I have known you all these years, Bonds  You have never, ever called me that  But, Joanie  He's a nerd  I'll take credit  The one thing I did come up with was Mr. and Mrs. C 
[02:32:00]  Hi, Mr. C  Wow  Mr. C, this is the best dinner I've ever had  Goodbye, Mr. C, Mr. C  Hey, Mr. C  Hey, Mr. C  We used to think this is getting a little ridiculous  Now they're just reaching for anything they can find  And just trying to force it into becoming a catchphrase  Yowza, yowza, yowza  It's such a hunk  Cheerleaders  Wah, wah, wah  It came from  Wah, wah, wah  And I would go, wah, wah, wah  That's where it came from 
[02:32:30]  Me and blue eyes  Wah, wah, wah  Wah, wah, wah  Wah, wah, wah  I am not going to leave wah, wah, wah  And blue eyes alone  Ick, ick, ick  How horrible  It's everything that was wrong with situation comedies  Just everything that just made you turn them off  How that show survived so long  I don't know  Even after the cast left 
[02:33:00]  We also have the audio of the very sad ending of the reunion special  Oh, well, I missed this  Eric was explaining how Fonz had hit the wall, but he barely hit it  He tapped it to turn off the lights in Arnold's, right?  Something like that  This is how it went down  I am so glad that we shared this party together  And I wouldn't have missed it for the world  And I want to thank all of you for sharing with us what's been an incredible day  Good night, everybody  Good night  Thank you so much  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute  Henry 
[02:33:30]  Come on  For old time's sake  Are you kidding?  Come on  Do it  Yay  Yay  He's turned off the lights, Anthony, by hitting the wall  Fonzie for old time's sake  Sorry, Sal  Can't do it  Happy days  Happy days  All right  Well, there you have that 
[02:34:00]  Gosh  An era  A lifetime ago  Should stay there  Also, Anthony, very sad news today  Coming out of Hollywood  Oh, I know  John Vernon is dead  John Vernon  You might say, who's John Vernon?  But if you saw him, you'd know who he was  He's dead  John Vernon  You're kidding?  72 years old  How did it happen?  It was a bad accident on the highway

[02:37:00]  Stubble secret propitiation  Yeah, well  John Burns said me to  Portrayed, uh  The evil dean in Animal House  He has died  Yeah  You know  I'm Dean Wormer  He, uh  Recently suffered a heart attack  And he died Tuesday  In his sleep at his home  Faye Br  Born in 1932  In Saskatchewan, Canada  You know what?  I'm reading, uh  The little article here  I didn't know he was in  The Outlaw Josie Wales  Yes 
[02:37:30]  I had no idea  One of my favoritest lines  Ever, ever  Was from The Outlaw Josie Wales  From John Vernon  And, uh  I've used it numerous times  It's when he, um  Looked at, um  One of these military commanders  And said  Don't piss down my back  And tell me it's raining  Just a great line  That's where that came from?  Yep  And he delivered it, of course  In his inimitable style  Right  What a voice this guy had  And just the perfect guy  To play Dean Wormer  In Animal House 
[02:38:00]  All those famous lines  We remember  We knew and loved  Yeah  His face when Flounder  Throws up on him  That, uh  The face he makes  When, when  Bluto puts the pencils  In his nose  It's great stuff  He was, uh  He was very good  Well, why don't we go  To the tribute tape, Anthony  How many movies  Was this guy in?  I know  It's, uh  His resume is ridiculous  A hundred and ten movies  Yeah  And, uh 
[02:38:30]  Numerous TV appearances  Well, why don't we go  To the tribute tape  Because we've got  Jim Norton on the line  Make sure he doesn't go anywhere  We've got to talk to him  But first, uh  In honor of, uh  Good old, uh  John Vernon  Dean  Vernon Wormer  Was his name  Let's listen to this  This year  We're going to grab  The bull by the balls  And kick those  Punks off campus  What do you intend  To do, sir?  Delta's already  On probation  They are?  Yes, sir  Oh

Well, have you?  I have, sir  I know it's a little below par  It's more than a little below par  Mr. Hoover  It stinks  It's the lowest on campus  It's the lowest in Faber history  Who dumped a whole truckload 
[02:39:30]  Of fizzies into the swim meet?  Who delivered the medical school cadavers  To the alumni dinner?  Every Halloween  The trees are filled with underwear  Every spring  The toilets  Explode  You're talking about Delta, sir  Of course I'm talking about Delta  You twerp  Now I want you to tell  Mrs. Stratton  And Mr. Schoenstein  Exactly what I'm about to tell you now  What's that, sir?

[02:41:00]  Here's our loving tribute  And the burn house  Oh, that is hysterical  Well, let's switch gears and say hi to old Jimmy Norton  I know Jimmy Norton  He stinks  Hi, guys  Hey, Jimmy  I can hardly hear you come on my dumb cell phone outside  What are you doing in Pittsburgh?  I'm doing the improv  Tonight and tomorrow  Oh, you are?  I didn't hear about that  I figured I  No, I forgot to mention it  I've been too busy  You know, it's all about the show  I figured I'd interview you as a regular comedian 
[02:41:30]  So, uh  I actually just did radio  Which was really fun  It's very rare that you enjoy it  I did a country station this morning  Which was kind of like  Hey, how are you?  You know, they did some old bridge jokes  It was fucking awful  Yeah, and unique  I'm sorry, I'm walking through security yesterday  And I just hear, uh  Jim Norton, you stink  And I'm being heckled  And it's by one of the guys  Who's actually looking at the bags  Going through security  Are you serious?  Yeah, so if you wonder why  Fucking bombs are sneaking out of the plane  It's because they're all listening  To this awful radio program  Hey, the phone number for the improv in Pittsburgh 
[02:42:00]  412-462-5233  Norton's in Pittsburgh all weekend long  And then he was supposed to fly to New Orleans with us  When are you going down there?  Sunday?  Yeah, I'm flying in Sunday morning to Newark  And then down to New Orleans  Oh, yeah?  Wow, what's the matter?  Well, we, uh  Have you checked your email yet?  No  Jimmy, uh, this is not a gag 
[02:42:30]  But, uh  XM screwed up your flight  What do you mean?  Well, I'll read an email from  Good old Club Soda Kenny  Who's sitting in with you today  Who's the guy  For you today  That takes care of us  As you know  This is to Megan  Norton is not booked on a flight on Sunday  From Newark to New Orleans  Or the return from New Orleans to Newark on Wednesday  If you, if you tell me  If you tell me  That they held the flight 
[02:43:00]  And never actually fucking had it ticketed  I'm going to throw my cell phone  According to Continental  Originally there was only a 24-hour courtesy hold  Put on those flights for him  But nobody followed through on them  Did he throw the, uh  Did he throw the cell phone?  What's the deal?  Um  Well  You know  Then Kenny said  Okay, well  You know  Kenny booked you another flight  On the same flight, Kenny?  Yes  The same flight as us  With one little more piece of bad news 
[02:43:30]  I'm not doing it  I'm not going  I'm not going  I'm not fucking going  I'm not fucking going  Do you want to hear the last bit of bad news?  What is it?  I think he knows what it is  Yeah, that's telling me in the back  Not happening  More bad news is that  First class is only available  Going to New Orleans  Um  But first is not available  On the return flight  Oh wow  You know what  Why is this always a problem?  Why isn't Kenny doing our travel?  Exactly  Why is this a fucking problem every time? 
[02:44:00]  Hello, exactly  Whoever is paying for the flights  Must request that he be wait-listed  Absolutely not  Unacceptable  Unacceptable  Indeed  It was already held  Why did they forget to follow through?  Why?  I don't know  I really don't know  I sent this off to the big bosses down in Washington  With a pretty angry response  It says this needs immediate attention  This is Club Soda Kenny's words  And then he writes in the email 
[02:44:30]  I don't know how anyone is going to justify this to Norton  Well I had already gone in and fixed seats and everything  What's the problem with this?  Why is this so difficult?  You book a flight  You pay for it  End of story  Why is this hard?  I know  I could not even believe that after the last debacle  Of course it happens again  Of course it does  And then they get mad at us  Because we want Club Soda Kenny to take care of all this  Because we know it will be taken care of right  Because we're his number one priority  Well you know what 
[02:45:00]  I'm just  I'm fucking  Just tell him to cancel the ticket  I'll stay home  I don't care  I hate New Orleans anyway  I don't care  It's annoying  You know what  What's the difference?  If it was a priority for them  They would have gotten it done  They would have done it  Right  It makes you feel like a second class citizen  It's just annoying dude  I've flown Coach a million times  It's not about that  It's just irritating  It should have been taken care of  No I explain that to everyone  I mean you do so much traveling  That it's just something you need to do  To feel comfortable at this point  Dude I've flown so much  It's all I do is  I'm on fucking planes  More than most people  That work for the airline 
[02:45:30]  It's like I know how to travel  And it's just  Why does this have to happen?  Why every time  Does it have to be a problem?  I don't know  You know Jim?  Yeah  It's Kenny  Yeah hi Kenny  You know I was just talking  To a friend of mine  And I said that you fly a lot  And why does this have to be a problem?  He goes yeah I know  I know  And that's what I was trying  To tell somebody  But they didn't want to listen  They're like you think so?  I'm like well it's probably  It's going to happen  I love you 
[02:46:00]  Kenny  It's sickening  How does  Why does this always happen?  Alright listen sweet cheeks  I'll take care of everything for you  Alright?  There's nothing you can do  What are you going to do?  I mean there's nothing you can do  We might be able to  All kidding aside  Get you on an earlier flight out  Or something  That might be first class  Yeah  The earlier flight  There's first coming back  Dude I'm not even  Then they can put me on  I'm not even being a prima donna  Dude most of my career  I fall in college  It's whatever  It's just the idea that like  When you tell somebody 
[02:46:30]  Let's do it this way  And they do it  And they don't follow up  How does it just fall  By the wayside every time  After last time  When Kenny would get it done  What's the problem?  Right  We don't really understand  And we barely pay Kenny any money  So it's not a money issue  After last time  This should have been  Taken care of  It happened again  Picture perfect  I would rather not travel  Dude  I would rather stay in New York  And just not travel  I deal with this crap enough  To stand up  And go on a gig  And having problems with flights  And layovers  And all these nightmares 
[02:47:00]  That happen  And the airline tells you one thing  And then your seat's not held  I've dealt with this so many times  So you're saying  You were flying  Since we were like minus eight  I was probably minus eight  When I was flying  And then I might as well  Quote the wrong Richard Pryor CD  Pop his asshole that guy was  Hey what's this Richard Pryor CD?  That Jack's crazy?  No stupid wrong one  Jimmy  This is the interesting part  About the whole email  If Kenny didn't just casually  You know  Check our confirmations  You know  You know how he's  How obsessive he is  So he checks it  A lot of different times 
[02:47:30]  This would have went unnoticed  Imagine us all at Newark  Can we get somebody on the phone?  Can we get  Is there any way to get  Logan or Straley  And go what happened again?  Not that Logan's got this to worry about  But can you get somebody on  And ask why?  I guess  We can try to figure that out  Yeah I would like to know  Why it happened  Dude I went on  And I even called  I even sent an email out  Because I think I went on  And checked  And said this  This has not been ticketed  I always go in  And fiddle at my seat  Because I'm an obsessive flyer  I hate flying  I'm afraid of it  The only airline I fly  You guys know  I'm only comfortable 
[02:48:00]  On one airline  So I finally figured out  A way to conquer this horror  And this is the way I do things  Right  I went in and checked  To fix my seat  So I have the right seat  And they said  This has not been ticketed yet  So I send an email off  This has not been ticketed yet  Right  Do I have a window seat Kenny  What's that?  I'm asking Club Soda Kenny  If I have a window seat  You have a choice of a window  Or an aisle seat  Oh because I could switch  I got you  I prefer the aisle  I prefer the aisle  I enjoy the window seat  Because I like taking a look out 
[02:48:30]  I do too  But I pee so much  And I'm like  It's like you're flying with somebody  But I fly usually  I'm not with somebody  Because I keep getting some stranger  Can I get up to pee  Can I get up to pee  That's embarrassing  And I feel claustrophobic  And as soon as I piss  I sit down  And my bladder feels pressure  Again  It's psychosomatic I think  Jimmy let me tell you something  I think I can make things  A little better  I'll give you half of my  Nice warm cinnamon roll  That I'm going to be getting  In first class  Well you know what you can do  With your cinnamon roll  Just keep it and bring it back  Because when I'm still in New York 
[02:49:00]  You can just hand it to me  When I see you guys  In the studio on Thursday  And then he can throw it  In his microwave  And heat it up himself  Yeah I'll be happy to do that  Yeah well  I just  That'll be good  They'll save money  On the hotel room  In New Orleans  It's really annoying  But you have to go  I just  Dude it's just like  If that's where their priorities are  I'm not even being a baby about it  I'm not even  If that's the way they feel  That's where they're playing  Fine  Because they're just fucking  No big deal  I understand  There is absolutely nothing  They can say down there  That's going to twist  Or turn this around  To be our fault again  Like last time  Like with the Vegas thing 
[02:49:30]  It's a problem  With the Vegas thing  For some reason  There was this little thing  Of how we were  Kind of somehow at fault  Yeah you weren't  And this  Now there's no reason  This should have happened  And this would not  Have been caught  If Kenny didn't just  You know  Check one more time  So not only  Did they not let Kenny do it  But then Kenny had to  Catch the problem  Yeah right  This is the way  Our travel should be handled  This is the way  You like to travel  I'm coordinating  Flying home  I'm switching my  You know  I'm coming home  And I'm getting right back  On a plane  I fly from Pittsburgh 
[02:50:00]  To Newark  My luggage goes right  To another plane  And I fly to New Orleans  So am I still on that flight  Coming down  Yes yes  You're coming  You got your flight  From Pittsburgh to Newark  But I mean  From Newark to New Orleans  What flight am I on  I held you  Another reservation  So XM has to put  The credit card down  Oh it's fucking mind boggling  With that credit card  Nonsense  Within the next 24 hours  Right  It's being held  For 24 hours  And that's on our flight  Yes  Yeah I got him 
[02:50:30]  I got him on our flights  Right  He's first going to New Orleans  But coming home  We're going to have to  Work something out  Right  Or  Of course  Of course  God forbid  This should be done right  Of course  Of course  Of course  So there you have it  You know  I mean  They just got to realize  We really know  What we're doing on this show  We know  We know what people  To hire around us  People listening to this  Are thinking like  What a baby  Stop  I believe you  If I was listening to this  I'd want to spit  In my fat face too  But it's just  It's so annoying  When you tell people  Just let us do it 
[02:51:00]  We know what we're doing  You know  Because if it wasn't  A matter of first and coach  It would be a matter of  Look coach is sold out  They have nothing  To put you on another air lot  It's like  When you don't do it right  There's always a problem  And why would there be  A lot of flights  Going down to New Orleans  Around Mardi Gras  I mean  Who goes there  This time of year  I understand  That on Saturday  They're trying to get me  A flight into Jacksonville  Fucking idiot  Yeah well  We really do know  What we're doing  On this program  They've really got to  Start listening to us  It's so aggravating 
[02:51:30]  Can you get me  And I'll see both ways  Is that possible  I can't  I'd be claustrophobic  Yeah  I know what you like  Dude I had all of this  Worked out  I know  And I even emailed them  And told them  This has not been  Taken care of yet  I think you could  Charter a plane  It's only about  $50,000  And that's a drop  In the bucket  Right  Yeah  50 grand  50 thousand's nothing  50 grand's nothing  Alright Jimmy  Sorry we had to  Break the bad news to you  But we figured it would  Make for some  Great radio today  If they can fix it  Fine  If they can't  I don't care if I go  Or not 
[02:52:00]  I hate New Orleans  Anyway dude  I want to go  But it's like you know  If that's where I am  On their priority list  Then fuck it  It's not worth it  Well do you mind  Well do you mind if we  Change the name of the show  If you're not down there  We can't call it  Norton and Friends  If you're not there  You can just call it  Norton's Friends  You can just take out  The N and put  Norton's Friends  Alright  First of all  This has to be dealt with  So Jimmy's coming down there  Because I am not going  To be miserable  In a puke ridden city  Without my friend Jimmy  I pledge my honest sincerity  To take care of that 
[02:52:30]  Alright we'll figure  Something out Jimmy  We're broadcasting live  Monday and Tuesday  From the Crazy Horse  Cabaret on Bourbon Street  If you're in the area  Come on by and say hi  We're doing the show  Three to six eastern time  Yes  The gig fell through  We're playing with the puppets  At the amusement park  No we're not at the Crazy Horse anymore  The gig fell through  And if you're in Pittsburgh  Tonight or tomorrow  Go see Jim Norton  At the Improv  412-462-5233  Opie and Anthony  At the Air Force Base  Alright Jimmy 
[02:53:00]  See you guys later  Alright bye  Alright  Love you  Wow  I hated that we had to do that  Because you hear how happy he was  Oh I know  Hi guys  Your flight is screwed up  Why the hell does this have to happen  Every time  And then it's angry Jimmy  Here's what  He warned them already  And they still didn't heed his warning  Everyone had been warned  These flights should have been done  Booked  Everyone  We knew where we were going  We knew who was going  There was no reason  They started out like gangbusters 
[02:53:30]  But then kind of fizzled out  Yeah  And I've been trying to  You know  Play nice  And be nice  You know  You have to continue being nice  So  I know  Well that's ridiculous too  Kenny's got to sit there  And kiss ass  And be all nice  But the truth of the matter is  He gets things done  Okay  And things aren't getting done  That we need done  I want an explanation  Okay  I want Kevin Straley  Because we're going to talk to him  After the show  I want him to tell me  What happened  And why this wasn't dealt with  Okay  Very good 
[02:54:00]  We should take a quick break Anthony  Because we have a lot to do  Still in this program  Well why don't we play  Jim Norton in Happier Times  From his  I was going to say  From his Eat a Bullet CD  No  From his Yellow Discipline CD  That you can find on  Eatabullet.com  See here's the thing  If you want to make a woman laugh  Don't be afraid  To show that special gal  What a silly goose you can be  Believe me guys  She'll love you for it  Women love it  When you let it all hang out  Maybe you're in a supermarket  There's the apple of your eye 
[02:54:30]  Standing by some bananas  Here's your opportunity to shine  I like to walk up  Look at the bananas  Look at her  And go ring ring  And then pick one up  And go hello  And if she laughs  I know she's retarded  And I have a shot  Nah nah  Yeah yeah yeah  Have a little magic juice  You genetic disaster  Glad you went with me 
[02:55:00]  On that one  I'm only joking  I got yelled at  In college  For that joke too  At the end of the show  A female member  Of the student government  Came up to me  And you know what  Wonderful senses of humor  They have  You know  Just such a typical puke  You know 
[02:55:30]  She's like  I don't think it's appropriate  To make fun of the mentally challenged  What if there were some here  I'm like in a college  What's your admissions test  Shitting on the floor  Let me know  If Britney Spears applies  She can use my mouth  See because people like to complain  But you're never going to see  College students protesting  To get retarded people admitted  Because that would inconvenience them 
[02:56:00]  You're never going to see  A bunch of Rutgers  Columbia  Yale students  More retards in class  You know how annoying  Would that be  Smother him  I actually had a weird experience  You know  Retarding people are cool man  I just  So I was in an emergency row 
[02:56:30]  On a plane  Flying emergency row  And sitting by the exit window  On the other side  Was a man with down syndrome  And he's not supposed to be  In that seat  That really is a safety hazard  When you're flying  So I'm trying to get  The flight attendant to move him  And I'm being very nice  I'm just kind of like  I'm being very low key  I'm not standing up  Retard  And she did very quietly move him 
[02:57:00]  And you know  That's all I wanted  I'm not trying to be a jerk  I just didn't want to be  In the middle of the flight  And have him yank that handle  Hoping Candy comes out  And blow the door off the plane  We all get sucked out  Except for him  Because his head gets stuck  I've gotten a lot of letters 
[02:57:30]  Written about that bitch  And I was thoroughly disappointed  And disgusted  In a starchy world  Wired in imperfection  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel  But for some reason  At this place  They put it like on the grill  One man  It's all about me, me, me  You challenge  The status quo  They don't have a toaster? 
[02:58:00]  That annoys me  Navigating treacherous terrain  There's crap all over it  Like I'm seeing grease  Confronting the unknown  And there's something green on it  Which could be a pepper  Or a booger  It's awful  With a platoon of interns  You sheep  And military precision  Go, go, go!  Fix it!  The world will witness  A revolution  Bagel diva  Coming soon  Come on  To a bakery near you  Are you kidding?

[02:59:00]  Crystal clear digital audio  XM satellite radio  Radio to the power of X  XM2 Hotel  The Opie and Anthony show  All right, we got to  Get to some stuff here  PJ Walsh is outside  The studio, Anthony  Oh, yeah?  He hangs with the  Blue Collar  Comedy guys 
[02:59:30]  Oh, yeah  Jeff Foxworthy  And Larry the Cable Guy  I believe  And  They're very funny  Very funny  And PJ Walsh  Is one of them, right?  Yeah  And then we got a girl  That kind of looks like  Lady Di  That's going to come in  And do the news, right?  Lady Di, if she was healthier  No, anyone with me?  Healthier  And  I  They're reached to the point  Where I just  Don't comment  This one's a beauty thing  Compared to Lady Di 
[03:00:00]  And that ain't saying much  Hey, is the monitor on out there?  Yeah  Probably  Oh, she's going  No, I don't  Because the delay  Just kicked in  For another uncomfortable moment  Yeah, well  Why don't we get PJ Walsh in here  They're turning down the monitor  So you can tell the listeners  How you really feel  About that mess out there  And  We also have  Pat from  CringeHumor.net  Yes  That's going to interview  Kenny live on the show  So what do you think?  The monitor's turned way down  Eric, I hope you turned it way up 
[03:00:30]  I hope, I hope  I can only hope  I can only hope  No, because I'm not commenting  On anything  No?  No, why would I say anything?  You asked if the monitor  Was turned out  I have one observation  About that chick  Okay  She's got big tits  I like a chick  That comes with standard airbags  Very good  If Bob, our agent's listening  You better call Philly  This isn't the clean show  That you were hoping for  Where did she come from? 
[03:01:00]  We're kind of auditioning people  To maybe be a news person  On the program  But I don't think  We put the word out  Like show up at the studio  So how did she  I don't know  She's a go-getter  Took the liberty  Of sending her material in  Saying she wanted to do it  Alright, well Ben  I think Ben said  She's a go-getter  If er is food  Go-getter  Let's get PJ in here  I said that already  Please  Alright  Alright, PJ Walsh  I also forget  That we rebroadcast this show  I know  That's the worst  Doesn't matter  You turn the monitor down  I know 
[03:01:30]  When you think  You got away with something  Yeah  They get to hear it  18 more times  I know  I know  That's the best  Because in the old days  You could get away with a line  And they would only catch it  Maybe when we went on vacation  Oh my god  That's the odds  That they're going to hear it  Yeah  And then there's nothing  They could do  Because we're on vacation  And then by the time  We get back from vacation  Eh, we all forgot about it  But with this replay schedule  You're right  Oh, at 1-11  She'll be listening  Going  Wait, this is where  I've got to start listening  Because it was just before  My appearance on the show  Yeah  We're the worst 
[03:02:00]  I didn't hear what they were saying  About me  PJ, what's going on, man?  I don't know, man  I got a freaking horn  In front of me  Yeah, that's Anthony's wacky horn  But he doesn't use it  Like other DJs  Would actually use a wacky horn  And he's sitting right next to me  Playing with my things  Why?  Because he wants to  When there's an open mic  And chair over there  Yeah, Anthony  Yeah, he put me over here  Why did you put him over here?  Anthony gets very nervous  When people are near him  Eric, are you  It's something that happened  Are you fucking crazy today?  There's something that  Don't take it personally  There's something that happened  Anthony on our time off  He gets very nervous 
[03:02:30]  When people are very close to him  I don't  No, you know where it comes from?  What?  It comes from our time on  At NEW  Yeah, because he's  I never lied  Because I would always get abused  By somebody that sat there  Nothing personal, my friend  No, I wouldn't  He got beat up by a girl  Once that was naked  A girl beat me up  With her poetry book once  She was completely naked  Is that where it started?  That's where it started and ended  Yeah  That was pretty much why  I then didn't want anybody  Even near me  She had Christmas lights on  And she was doing really bad poetry  And she was naked  And she beat up Anthony  Because he laughed at her poetry 
[03:03:00]  And you beat her off with a horn?  No, I just kind of hung out  And let security take care of the issue  Yeah  And then after that  People would come in  Not you, you know  You're a guy  You're doing an interview  That's fine  But there would be these skanky  Skank whores  That would come in  And do things with themselves  You know  Touching various body parts  And you know  They're just diseased whores  Because they're allowing us  To do things to them  With baseball bats and whatnot  And then  They're all drunk  And they're next to you  So you're right there 
[03:03:30]  They feel compelled  To then touch you  Or come over  And like grab you  And try to kiss you  And stuff  It's like  Get away from me  You get diseases that way  It's the Opie and Howard Hughes  Show  Yeah  The Aviator  That sounds like a skanky whore  With a poetry book  You know the other day  When you said  I was sounding like  A raving lunatic  Over the milk  I sound like  You're sounding a little weird  Right now  A little strange  You're like  You're freaked out  Because naked girls  Are touching you  And  Yeah  You know

[03:10:30]  She's like an old peep show girl that we used to have on our show.  All those noises came from her.  I don't know why you're scared of her.  I don't know how you can't touch that.  I'll mount that in a second.  That line's hilarious.  Some of the reasons she was making those sounds is a story unto itself.  For another day, because we're running out of time.  So, PJ, you did the blue collar thing?  Yeah, I'm out on the road with Larrity Cable Guy right now.  Right on.  Yeah, Larrity was a lot of fun on our show.  Good guy.  Yeah, great guy, man.  Great audience.  A lot of fun.  Crazy, crazy people.  Did you watch the State of the Union thing or anything? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The ups and downs, the boos, the hugs, all the laughs.  I thought yours was much better.  Oh, when he was just smirking at people.  Oh, yeah.  He gets that little smirk.  They always have to bring in somebody.  They always have to point out that one person that they try to connect with.  They don't know them fucking whatsoever.  They're always like, I know Jenny Johnson who lost her son.  And then so and so.  And then all the big applause.  And then the Iraqi lady was hugging her.  And the Democrats had a scope on him to take him out. 
[03:11:30]  And so, I don't know.  I'm not up for all that shit.  Yeah, right on.  I'm not up.  We're on a blue college.  We don't get too political.  No.  We just, you know what I mean?  We just.  You better not.  You're doing a lot of those red states.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, yeah.  We're pretty much in the middle of America.  About drinking beer and.  Drinking beer.  Driving your pickup truck and NASCAR.  Fucking your sister and.  Absolutely.  And doing all.  So, it's a good tour.  Great people.  We're having a blast.  We'll be in Hershey next week.  Oh, yeah.  State College, Pennsylvania.  So, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of crazy. 
[03:12:00]  Right on.  Redneck tales.  You've got to help us out with this news girl, Liz.  All right.  We have, like, too much stuff going on.  We're trying to get, like, a news person on our show.  So, we.  I don't know.  We're having.  I think we're having, like, open auditions.  Hey.  Hey, Liz.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Wow.  How are you doing?  Huh?  I didn't.  Don't look at me.  Holy.  Jeez.  I didn't say that.  Oh, my God.  I absolutely didn't say that.  Opie said that.  All right.  Look.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  That's okay, but I do have a fully functional liver.  I just need to let you know that.  All right.  But hold on a minute.  Why is this so confrontational?  Hold on.  We were going to let it slide. 
[03:12:30]  We were going to let that little comment slide and let it just kind of float out there.  We've got to get your picture on the website now.  And then we're going to get a picture of Lady Di.  And people are going to go, wow, there's a similarity.  Okay.  I said you're a healthier Lady Di, by the way.  I certainly hope so.  All right.  So, get Steven here to take a picture.  I'm telling you.  We'll get it up on opianthony.com and we'll let the listeners decide.  Right?  She looks like one of my old girlfriends.  Oh, yeah?  Chlamydia.  Was that one of your jokes, Kenny?  Prepared jokes?  Kenny's very big and stupid. 
[03:13:00]  Well, the redneck's laughing.  The redneck.  I'm from New York, you son of a bitch.  I'm from here.  He's laughing because he doesn't want to get beat up.  He's very intimidating, right?  Yeah, I'm not going to.  He's really big and stupid, but he throws a mean punch.  I'm good at that.  All right.  So, Liz.  I think the only thing, Lady Di, is, you know, she's kind of got a chubby face is what  it is.  Yeah.  So, that's, you know, but you can say anyone.  And I haven't started drinking yet.  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  You drink or no?  No.  No?  And Kenny's right, you've got big boobies.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Kenny said it.  Yeah.  Well, thank you very much, Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you got a hold of Ben to do the news?  I certainly did.  I didn't even think he was going to get back to me, so it was kind of shocking.  Are you a news person?  I used to be.  For who?  For a little station up in a little town called Port Jervis.  Port Jervis.  That's Maine?  No, that's actually New York.  Oh, Port Jervis.  New York?  Yeah, that's out there. 
[03:14:00]  Isn't there a Port something Maine?  I'm certain there is.  Somewhere probably on the coast.  I need to report something everywhere.  Thanks for going with that one.  She looks like what you call, Opie, one of those Buffalo Bettys.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you definitely have the Buffalo Betty look going.  Well, that's all right.  No, because the Buffalo girls, they get the big sweaters to hide their buns.  That's right.  And a bunt.  I don't know if you have a bunt, because you're hiding something down there.  I'm hiding everything down here. 
[03:14:30]  Do you have the stretch pants on, too?  She's a chubby girl.  That's okay what they say.  Girls come in all shapes and sizes, Opie.  That's right.  All wonderfulness.  She's a cute variety.  You're cute in an endearing type of way.  Thank you.  So are you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He's better than that.  Come on.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 30.  30?  She's got a baby face.  She looks younger than 30.  Huh?  Pastor Prime.  That's right.  Why is she Pastor Prime?  Jesus. 
[03:15:00]  30.  That's experience.  Have you seen Nicolette Sheridan?  She's all over the tube crying and stuff.  She looks really hot.  Yeah.  And she's a lot older than 30.  Is she like 50?  Yeah, but how can you compare the two?  All right.  Good point.  Yeah, she's probably a lot taller than I am.  Yeah.  So, Liz, wow, you've got very long stories there.  Serious news.  Serious news?  Why are you giving me a Kathy Bates look right now?  Don't worry.  I'm not going to do anything to you.  All right.  No hobbling. 
[03:15:30]  Should we start to teletype and see what Liz has?  If she has some news chops, Anthony?  Sure.  I'd like to ask her a little more about Port Jervis.  Her experience.  Oh, no.  That was about six years ago.  But your experience up there was a radio station.  You did the news?  Those were the radio station.  I was the news director up there.  And there's really not a lot going on up there.  I mean, like, the biggest news was, like, you know, the sale at Bob's Crack Den.  There's, like, nothing going on up there.  And then, so now I'm down at a station down the shore, and now I'm here. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Good.  Let's, uh...  All right.  Should we start to teletype and see what happens here?  All right.  All right, Derek, if you will.  Now with the news, the lady died lookalike girl.  Well, according to an initial report, the head of the U.N. oil for a food program,  the non-Savann made oil deals with Iraq and violated standards of integrity.  According to commission chairman Paul Volcker, Savann repeatedly solicited...  Wait, wait.  What'd you say?  What?  What'd you say?  What did I say what?  Poker. 
[03:16:30]  Volcker.  No, before that.  Chairman?  No, no, before that.  Commission?  No.  Of?  No, before that.  According to?  No.  Before that.  Integrity?  I don't know.  Forget it.  Hey, she's auditioning.  Let her be.  She doesn't need you chiming in during her audition.  That's fine.  All right, go ahead, Liz.  All right, where were we?  According to commission chairman Paul Volcker, Savann repeatedly solicited several million barrels of oil on behalf of a company called African Middle East Petroleum. 
[03:17:00]  The report said Savann seriously undermined the integrity of the United Nations and suggested he may...  Thank you.  Yeah.  Imagine if you never...  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Imagine if you never heard that story.  Is this like American Idol?  Are we going to have to vote now or...  Thank you.  Give our opinion.  Oh, no.  Opie, what do you think?  Thank you. 
[03:17:30]  We'll be in touch.  We're not moving on to...  Anything on the crack den in Port Jarvis?  There's always a sale.  Opie, you're going to have to pass?  Yeah, because I just saw a hot piece of ass walking around outside.  Oh, nice.  Her.  Wow-wee.  I think you were great.  What the...  I think you did a very professional, clear, concise job at reading the news.  Have a good radio voice for the news.  Oh, thank you.  Nice female tone to that, and it absolutely does not fit this program.  Oh, no. 
[03:18:00]  Yes.  I don't know.  Ben said serious stories.  A Paula Abdul fashion.  I did.  I was going for the Paula Abdul kind of thing.  Opie went for the...  Tears.  Simon.  And Kenny?  What?  My fatso.  Oh.  We're going to get the blood stars in your news next.  Kenny.  She waited an hour and a half for that.  You are rude.  Eric, show her the door.  Thanks.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you, everybody.  I think you did a bang-up job.  Thank you.  You're welcome, and good luck in your future endeavors. 
[03:18:30]  The Brooklyn Diners down the street.  Thank you very much.  Have fun with your whatever.  Yeah.  Do you have the music you play?  There's a deli downstairs.  I've got to deal with those guys.  What's wrong, Ben?  She stunk.  Oh, man.  Who's the hot piece of ass?  Damn, why isn't she reading the news?  Get her to read the news.  Yeah, get her to read the news.  Watch how interested we'll be when she reads the news.  Watch Kenny perk up when that happens.  Oh, I've got a few questions for her.  I bet you do.  You're going to tell her what a deli is?  There she goes.  All right, there she goes.  Off to, what did you say, the Brooklyn Diner? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a diner downstairs.  If you don't think God has a sense of humor, just look at these two out there conversing.  You mix up the DNA one way, you get that thing, and then you mix it up another way,  and you get, wow.  I'll say.  Tell her not to walk down the middle of the street, because Ghostbusters will try to cross  the streams and destroy her.  This is good music, too, because it is actually like David Manor, and then there's the Hulk.  It kind of works perfect. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, wow.  Kenny's interview?  Yeah.  Wait, that's not the piece of ass that's getting naked?  That's the piece of ass's publicist.  Whoa.  Wow, she's hotter than the piece of ass, I think, though.  Really?  Nah.  No?  Oh, I haven't seen the...  She's got much publicity.  All right, well, why don't we get Pat from CringeHumor.net?  We're trying to get through a bunch of things here.  Unbelievable.  We also have PJ in studio.  You know, Kenny, you know, big girls give good head.  I wouldn't get that upset.  I'm a married man, sir. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know what you're referring to.  Huh?  It's so appealing.  Oh, what?  Sorry.  I think he wants to just go home at this point.  Oh, it was just...  It was, like, stuck in my head.  It just popped out.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  PJ, do you have anything?  I, man, I don't know.  I'm still...  I'm always nice to fat girls because I know they give good head.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Banana fool.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[03:20:30]  Banana phony.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana fool.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana fool.  All right, sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Comedy all about timing.  PJ, you would know that, right?  Yeah, I think, you know, your time on calling that girl fat.  I was like, whoa, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Yeah, that was very...  That was just unbelievable.  That was just rude, Kenny.  I ran out of things to say. 
[03:21:00]  Do you have another joke?  That's funny.  I ran out of things.  I blurted that one out.  You're huge.  Do you have another joke for us?  Nah, let Patrick do his thing here.  Yeah, Patrick's here from cringehumor.net.  Yes, I'm here to...  That's a great website.  That's my awful interview skills for Club Sovereign.  Yeah, you've been really taking a beating.  Opie says your interview skills...  I'm not the only one.  Stink.  I'm not even going to defend myself.  It was fucking horrible.  Have you listened to his interview skills?  Well, I have.  They stink. 
[03:21:30]  It's terrible.  I completely choked that night in front of Opie.  You're dead?  Beautiful blonde hair, yes.  How...  What?  He was interviewing you?  Yeah, for some...  And Bob Kelly?  Yeah, we were filming...  They were sending to the troops.  Yeah, we filmed the show at the Comedy Cellar for the troops in Iraq.  Right.  So Opie stopped by.  We're going to do like man-on-the-street interviews.  Cool.  He just busted my balls and made me choke up.  Bad.  What was he doing that was really bad?  Yeah.  He just gave me one word answers.  No, you just...  Your technique was awful.  Even Bob Kelly said it.  Are you this important that you need a camera guy with you?  It's for the website. 
[03:22:00]  It's my black photographer, Lamont.  Oh.  Oh.  That was uncalled for.  He knows he's black.  You don't have to point out to him.  He's actually the whitest black man there is.  He has a job.  What do you call a black...  He's got a job.  He stepped on it, Anthony.  I had another joke.  Now look at what you do.  Now you don't say it.  I had a really good joke and now I can't tell it because comedy's all about timing.  You want to hear a really inappropriate joke that was just presented to me from your producers?  Yeah.  What do you say when you see your TV floating around your room in the dead of night? 
[03:22:30]  Drop it, nigger.  Holy...  Jesus Christ.  Dude, man.  I'm telling you, this is a list of jokes I was given by your producers.  I don't even hear those jokes in the red states.  Are you insane?  You're not that stupid, are you?  Are you crazy? 
[03:23:00]  It was topical.  We were talking about a black man.  Do you know you're trying to endear yourself to the brass down there in Washington and you  blurt out a joke that can't even be taken any other way but insanely racist?  All right, maybe I can redeem myself with this one.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What do you think?  What do you think?  You're hanging out with dice still?  No.  We'll take the joke page away from him, please.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:30]  I smell a tsunami coming.  Let's calm down.  You're fire.  And why didn't the colored gentleman punch in?  He's taking pictures.  He's taking pictures.  He's enjoying the joke so much, he's taking pictures as you're telling it.  That's so he can give it to his peeps so they can bust Kenny's head open when they see him.  It's over.  That's cringe humor.  You wait.  There's going to be a bunch of fat black guys chasing you down the street.  All right, well.  So we got Patrick from CringeHumor.net and he wants to interview Kenny for the website.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, let me do my little gay intro here.  This is Patrick from CringeHumor.net with the legend in the world of comedy, the star of HBO's Inside the NFL, the fourth member of the ONA show, and a runner-up for Breakthrough Performer in the 2004 Cringe Humor Awards, Mr. Club Soda Kenny.  How are you doing this morning, sir?  See how bad this is?  I told you.  I'm reading it verbatim.  I'm nervous, cracking.  Why would you ask me that question?  What?  How are you doing this morning, sir?  Yeah.  Just a little icebreaker. 
[03:24:30]  All right, next question.  All right, let's start off with a question that most people have on their mind.  He has a problem with how you do.  What a tool.  People want to know if you're a helmet head or an anteater.  That's your question?  That's all right.  That was fascinating.  Let's talk about you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Helmet head or anteater?  It's a little take on your manhood down there.  Is it clipped or unclipped? 
[03:25:00]  No, like, because that's what I asked all the girls at the porno.  Right, right, right.  It's a little callback.  See, he's trying to hone in on that.  He's trying to be cute.  I got you.  Do you have an answer?  Yeah, like everybody.  Next.  All right.  Is it you that you're one of New Jersey's finest?  No.  What is your background in martial arts?  Why don't you ask me, like, nice questions?  This is why I want to do this.  This is so bad.  All right.  Yeah, like, why don't you ask me, how old are you? 
[03:25:30]  What's your favorite color?  Green.  All right.  Many people first fell in love with you when you were Andrew Dice Clay's right-hand man.  How did you come to work with Dice?  I was very lucky.  How did you meet him and strike up a relationship?  Come on.  Talk about something interesting.  Let's go.  We're talking about you.  This is what I was brought down for.  Yeah, so ask me questions like, did you go to college?  Did you go to college?  I have a PhD. 
[03:26:00]  A pretty hard dick.  Am I setting up your awful hack material here?  Man.  Man.  Can I ask some of your questions?  Because this is fucking horrible, man.  You run a site that critiques comics?  What do we got here?  This isn't even you.  All right, listen.  Who are your comic influences?  That's actually a decent one.  Really? 
[03:26:30]  I guess.  This is the best one I can read here.  Maybe we see.  No, like, a more interesting question would be...  Give him one more question.  Like, ask me, like, am I married?  Are you married, sir?  I was once engaged to a girl with a fake leg, but I broke it off.  Didn't you work in a hospital at one point?  Yeah, yeah.  I used to be a gynecologist, but I got fired because I got caught eating on the job. 
[03:27:00]  What's the best thing about fucking a four-year-old in the shower?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, Patrick, that went great.  Patrick from Crenshaw.net.  Thank you.  I represented myself well.  We're going to have to stop it right there because we have an old friend of the show that  wants to say hi, and it just always degenerates.  When we have more than one extra mic on in this studio, it degenerates into perversion 
[03:27:30]  and a racist sinkhole.  Oh, hello?  Hello.  Oh!  Lewis Black, everyone.  Lewis.  It's good that that is the one extra mic.  Yeah.  That's all it takes is one extra mic.  One extra mic, and this whole show degenerates.  Me and Opie, believe it or not, people think we're completely out of control.  We kind of know where we should stay in between the lanes on this show, but it's the other 
[03:28:00]  people that join in that get us in the most trouble.  When did this happen that you guys had your revelation?  Well, we had our two years off.  Two years off might have something to do with it.  We had a lot of time to think.  You took some time off and went to a Buddhist community?  We had a lot of time to think, Lewis.  Buddhist community?  No, it's more like going to the Poconos, seeing Lewis Black, and going into Foxwoods and seeing 
[03:28:30]  Lewis Black.  I was like, Lewis Black's groupie for two years.  You saw Lewis Black on your time off?  Oh, a couple of times, yeah.  Very good.  How are you guys doing?  We're employed.  You know, this is ridiculous how long it's taken, because I would go on, I would call XM  to try to get this number, and I couldn't get it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's a top-secret number. 
[03:29:00]  They don't want any celebrities calling our show.  No, it would be ridiculous.  It was unbelievable.  It was like, how can you not give me the number?  How can it not be printed anywhere?  Lewis, you know us on this show, too.  We're not paranoid in the least.  We don't knee-jerk, have knee-jerk reactions to things that happen.  So we absolutely didn't think for a second that you were trying to blow us off in any  way, shape, or form.  And nothing bad was said about you on this show, because we assumed you were blowing us  off.  That's what I heard about that. 
[03:29:30]  Because I have one psychotic who keeps writing my website, saying, you know, he's blowing  you up.  Yeah, like I got the energy.  That's what I do.  I sit around, I'm just, yeah, things have really changed.  Now I just pump up my chest.  Well, Ben, our producer here, Ben is a little busybody, little gossip.  And from what he was saying, it sounded like we were trying to get in touch with you, but  you weren't returning calls. 
[03:30:00]  And you had said you will come on sometime next year when your book comes out.  It was like all kinds of stuff that you would normally say if you're trying to blow someone  off.  So we were a little alarmed.  And of course, we, instead of looking and trying to find the truth and the facts in it,  just came out like, wow, Lewis is turning into a tool.  And I was thinking that this isn't the guy that we got arrested.  No.  Look, I'm indelibly linked to you guys.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I think we share the same DNA.  You sound so happy about that, too. 
[03:30:30]  No.  Unbelievable.  I blow you off because of my book.  Well, we, well, now we understand that it wasn't that at all.  The message never got to you.  We were kind of bummed there for a while.  But I got to tell you, how happy are you that Bush got reelected, man?  Bush, I think after that speech, I think we all know that everything's going to be great.  Didn't it seem like everything was just going to be okay?  It's unbelievable.  Nothing bad can be.  And we're all going to win the lottery.  Right.  Nothing bad could be happening in this country if the president himself can be up there winking, 
[03:31:00]  smiling, pointing, and nodding to his buddies.  What the, ugh.  It was just unbelievable.  But I said it was like, you know, these people would call me and they were all depressed  that he won, and I'd say, well, it's just a question of what, why would you be upset?  It was just a question of what kind of shit did you want to eat?  Yeah, because John Kerry wasn't really, you know, going to change things around, for the 
[03:31:30]  better, anyway.  Why was he going to change things around when you listen to him talk and in the middle of  a paragraph, you'd be going, gee, I don't have enough breadcrumbs to get home?  Yeah, how do you feel about Bush's State of the Union?  I think it's perfect.  I think everything's going to be perfect.  I can't wait.  I can't wait for the medical stuff.  I can't wait for this.  I can't wait for him to privatize Social Security.  Nobody even knows what that means.  Nobody knows what it means. 
[03:32:00]  Nobody.  Not even him.  I think we're supposed to take some of our money that would normally go into Social Security  and put it in stocks, like whatever we deem, you know.  Actually, you're supposed to take some of that money, build a stock, and put your legs and  your arms through it, like you were living in Puritan times.  Was that what he was saying?  I thought he meant, like, stocks.  No, it was four percent.  Yeah, take four percent of your money.  Right.  Which is nothing, and then it will create nothing.  But that nothing is better than the other nothing. 
[03:32:30]  And that's going to pay for all the older people that are...  Delusional.  Delusional.  Yeah.  What are we supposed to do, though?  I heard it's like a pyramid scheme, the whole Social Security thing, and the bottom is falling  out.  Well, you know, what we're supposed to do is not really worry about it, because we elect  leaders who are supposed to actually find people to figure it out, and apparently nobody  has any brains anymore.  I think Bush has figured it out.  I think you're just being partisan here, Lewis.  Oh, yeah, partisan.  Yeah, that's a new word. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, it's like if you disagree, you're partisan.  You're playing partisan politics.  I am, yeah.  Yep, I am.  I'm a member of the Spanish Civil War.  I'm a partisan.  Idiots.  The guy can blow me.  He's crazy.  They're crazy.  I see a man coming up with a viable solution, and people on the other side just don't want  to see him be successful, so they're bashing his plan.  Well, it's the $2 trillion that's the problem. 
[03:33:30]  Is it going to cost $2 trillion to implement this?  Yeah, that's the problem.  And we don't have any money left anyway.  Is that real money, or is that that paper money everyone just brings up in these blah, blah,  blah numbers that no one really understands?  Nobody understands any of it.  Democrats or Republicans don't understand it.  You get 10 or 12 of these geeks.  You put them in a room and say, you'd like to figure this stuff out.  Do it.  Yeah, but it's like, you know, you wake up with trillions of dollars in debt. 
[03:34:00]  I wake up.  The water comes on for my shower.  The electric comes on for my coffee pot.  What do I care about a few trillion in debt?  Who's coming to collect?  Bulgaria?  It's going to come break our legs?  Who's actually coming over here to collect our debts?  We're the big guy on the block.  Well, okay.  Ooh, I'm afraid.  Look out.  Pakistan's coming to bust our legs for that 350.  Well, when you guys are replaced by the Wing and Fang, the new two Chinese guys, 
[03:34:30]  then we'll talk about it.  All I have to say is, why not Yemen?  Why not?  Hey, in the end, I was completely right about Yemen.  There are a bunch of snakes over there.  You were right about Yemen.  I have been vindicated.  Vindicated on Yemen.  No kidding.  You just sitting there reading those, looking at your, at the internet board came up with that. 
[03:35:00]  Unbelievable.  Look at me going out on a limb, picking someplace in the Middle East and saying they might be terrorists there.  We got to get her in, or we got a porn star that we need to get in, too.  I understand, guys.  I just wanted to let you know that I miss you and I love you.  Where are you, Louis?  I'm in Los Angeles.  L.A.?  Yeah.  You live out there now?  No, no, no.  I'm on permanent tour now.  I'm like the guys in Iraq.  I'm just there.  I'm gone.  You think you're coming home and they tack more time on the end, right? 
[03:35:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, next time you're in New York, please stop by.  I will.  We're national.  You want to plug something?  I'm in, no.  Doesn't matter.  I never came on to plug anything.  I just came on to yell.  No, but this is the new and improved Opie and Anthony program.  We actually get things done on this show now.  Well, then I'm not coming on.  I like the old, let's skid around and fool up and fuck it.  Yeah, and make believe we're doing a radio show. 
[03:36:00]  What about the book?  When is that coming out?  The book comes out April 1st.  And what is it called?  It's called Nothing Sacred.  I'll bring you guys a copy, hopefully, when I'm in town.  Please do.  All right, Louis.  Okay.  Thank you, Louis.  Thanks, man.  Miss you.  We miss you, too.  Okay, I'll stop in.  I'll talk to Ben.  We'll figure it out.  Then I'm going to...  Or being a gossiper.  He had you doing coke with Tom Brady somewhere.  I don't know.  Something going on with him.  All right, Louis.  Thank you.  Okay.  There he goes.  A real good friend of the show.  Sorry about that.  A real good friend of the show, Louis Black.  He's great.  See?  I knew he was still a pal. 
[03:36:30]  All right, he's back on the table.  I saw him at Foxwoods.  It was in there.  I was checking in, and I looked in.  I saw his poster, and I was like, I'm going to go see Louis tonight.  And he was all cordial and everything.  So we added two more things to the old show.  From the old show today.  Yeah, look at that.  Louis Black is back, and this.  Oh, ow.  See, but I need those.  Ow.  Sandy Kane clips.  I need the Sandy Kane clips.  And we got PJ in the studio.  It's just been a clusterf.  I apologize.  You're not being a fan.  Hey, that's cool, man.  You guys are doing the Iraq thing. 
[03:37:00]  I'm going there next month.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm going to go over again.  That's a pretty intense place.  That's what all our friends say.  Yeah, they need laughter.  So any comics out there, get a chance to go over.  Isn't that great?  They deploy the comics over there.  Yeah.  I was there last year, man.  We got bombed and shot at.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It was insane.  Those were the guys who didn't like our jokes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  No, it was wild.  See you there, Kenny.  That's why I wanted Kenny. 
[03:37:30]  That was a delayed reaction, but it was funny.  So you're going over there to make him laugh?  Yeah, I'm going to go over there.  I've been over there before.  So you have funny friends?  So, yeah.  Bring on the whore.  Yeah.  She can't sit next to you, though, right?  Hey, that sounds off out there, isn't it?  Yeah, let's bring on the, uh, let's bring in the slut.  Oh, Jesus.  No, she's a beautiful porn star.  At least we got somebody skinny come in.  They really don't like being called sluts and whores anymore.  It's all about being porn stars. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, I'm finally getting a look at the other publicist.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, they're all hot.  Yeah, she's cute.  Well, Eric, if you...  She looks like that stewardess that skidded off the runway a little bit.  What's up, Eric?  She's not here.  Oh, she's not here?  She's not here.  Steve's on the phone with her right now.  The publisher's here.  The publisher's here.  A friend of hers is here.  She's not here.  Don't tell them to get naked.  They're in here, yeah.  No, I don't want them in here.  Just tell them to get naked.  Hmm.  Yeah, right at the window.  I mean, if they're going to get naked, then, yeah, they come in, right?  Wow, we could have continued with Louis Black.  I thought they were ready out there for us.  Coming out with Louis.  Oh, well.  You know what? 
[03:38:30]  Last night, um, quickly, I just want to say, last night I was playing, uh, a lot of poker.  I don't know if I...  I'm going to have a meeting about this on the phone later, but, uh, things might be happening.  We're working on things.  Things might be happening.  So I was, uh, playing a little No Limit, a little No Limit Hold'em last night online  on Party Poker, and, uh, I was doing really good.  I got raped, man.  Raped.  One hand.  Just.  I had a full house.  Oh. 
[03:39:00]  I had a full house.  You had the full house.  I had the full house.  What happened?  It wasn't, like, a really good one.  I was confident about it.  I had, I had fours full of queens.  This guy pulls out.  Oh, he had two queens in his hand, so he had queens full house, and, oh, it just, I felt  really good about it, and it's No Limit.  It's not like the Limit room.  All right.  How much did it cost you?  I was, uh, I was all in for a hundred bucks on that hand, you know? 
[03:39:30]  It was, and, and it's a twenty-five dollar room, so you start with twenty-five bucks,  and it took me a while to build it up to a hundred.  Isn't a hundred dollars, though, a mere bag of shells?  Oh, I'm not saying, don't, don't think I'm talking about the money.  Yeah, I thought it was, go, easy come, easy go.  Mere bag of shells.  See, that's how I do impressions.  I just go, mere bag of shells.  That's my new thing.  Instead of trying to actually sound like the person.  I gave a hundred dollars to the telephone, man, just to take the clicking out of the  phone.  Yeah, it was, uh, no, no, don't get me wrong, it's not the money.  It's the fact that, you know, you're building up your, your pot, and then to just blow it 
[03:40:00]  all like that, and have some guy just rape you like that, it's a little disturbing.  But we're, we're working on things, and it looks like it might be happening, and it's  very exciting.  And it involves poker.  Steve, you better get her on the phone, because we're not doing an interview after the show,  because I got somewhere to go.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, they got stuck in traffic for, uh, literally two hours, and the guy  just called me, he said, can't, can't, can't we tape it afterwards?  I'm like, ugh.  Is that figuratively three hours? 
[03:40:30]  It's like literally two.  I would say figuratively five.  Yeah, you know what, so let's, let's give a take, I guess, I guess there was a bad accident  on the LAE, and they got really held up.  It's, uh, Tara Patrick, she was supposed to come in, she's playing the, uh, Larry, uh,  Flint's Hustler Club, February 8th at 9pm.  Oh, you ever been there?  Uh, no.  I pass it all the time, it's on the West Side Highway.  It looks cool, it looks, uh, classy from the outside.  I wonder what it's like in there.  I've been there.  You have?  Oh, yeah, it's nice.  Is it pretty cool?  Yeah, it's cool.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's cool.  Totally nude, or?  Uh, if you can go upstairs.  Upstairs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you always gotta pay extra for in a box. 
[03:41:00]  Come on, man.  And the joke is...  No champagne in the champagne room?  What?  Nothing.  Yeah, I'm listening to you all.  I know you are, you're just trying to make it easier.  I'm gonna hear the replay.  You'll be laughing at home.  This stinks, because she was supposed to come in here and do some stuff for us.  Mm-hmm.  And now we're just sitting here, and, uh...  I guess we have a no-show.  Yeah, no-shows stink.  Oh, well.  Yeah, especially when they're gonna get naked.  Where was she? 
[03:41:30]  Because I know a lot of porn stars, they don't get naked.  No.  And she's married to, uh...  She's married to...  What's his name?  Evan from Biohazard?  Yeah.  Yeah, and he's like a big dude.  He was on Oz.  He was on Oz.  Yeah.  And, uh, believe me, it wasn't a stretch for him to play a convict.  Yeah, he's a scary guy.  And I hear he's very protective of her, which is odd, being that she's a porn star.  And just getting nailed by other guys all the time.  Uh, if you say wrong things about her, you know, or call her certain words that I guess 
[03:42:00]  we've been calling her in the studio, he could come in and kick your ass, which wouldn't  be a fun thing.  All right.  Well, we should wrap up the show then, I think.  Is that it?  What time is it?  Uh, we gotta get a break early because we, uh, we went long here, but, uh...  Aw.  We're heading to New Orleans tomorrow.  We're broadcasting live Monday and Tuesday from, um...  Crazy Horse Cabaret.  Oh, thank you, Kenny, on Bourbon Street.  We'll be doing our show Monday and Tuesday from 3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time.  Vanilla Thunder from Philly. 
[03:42:30]  Uh, I'll have a secret message.  No, it's the other one.  There you go.  All right.  Very good.  PJ, you got anything to plug?  No, just Larry and I will be in Hershey next week.  Uh, I'll be...  Just got to the city, so I'll be doing clubs around the city coming the next few months.  And you'll be hanging out.  You'll be telling the jokes there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll be telling all the jokes there.  You guys didn't even have any lines for jokes.  They're like, there's going to be no jokes.  I'm like, good.  I don't want to tell fucking jokes.  This is a joke-less program.  Yeah.  They're like, just go in.  Stop it.  Hang out.  Stop it. 
[03:43:00]  There's going to be...  All right.  How about this?  There's going to be calling weather girls fat.  There's going to be delis.  All right.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Club Soda Kenny, you got a joke?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was looking at those girls out there.  Yep.  And that girl, she looks really good in those pants.  Yeah.  But those pants would look better on my bedroom floor.  See?  There's a joke.  Yeah.  That's a joke?  Yeah.  PJ?  I'm holding back because they're going over so strong this morning.  Yeah.  How about a joke, PJ?  A joke? 
[03:43:30]  You know, I used to work as a security guard at a mortuary.  And one night, I was walking around doing my rounds, and one of the bodies popped up.  And I never put my clothes on so fast.  See why I held them back?  All right.  I was going to go to the phones.  Tom from New Orleans was on, but we might be watching the Super Bowl with Tom.  We are gluttons for punishment, or we forget really quickly. 
[03:44:00]  Because why would we want to spend any time with Tom from New Orleans?  Do you recall what that was like?  Because they will make good radio out of it.  Self-sacrifice, then, you're saying?  Yeah, self-sacrifice.  Throwing yourself on the hand grenade.  Yeah.  All right.  The publicists are getting nervous, but there's nothing we can do.  We've got to end the show.  Not the music.  The end of show music is rolling already.  I don't even know how.  Well, Steve, I can't go to them if they're still on hold.  I mean, not on hold.  They're not even...  Yeah, there they are.  Who is that?  Evan?  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  We ran out of time.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Guys, you're killing me.  We just flew it on the red-eye from L.A.  We drove straight here in the soupy traffic.  I'm on 57th and 5th.  Aw.  We have...  How much time?  30 seconds.  There's 30 seconds left on the show.  This is the deal with the show?  We're not allowed to go late.  They cut us off right at 10.  I thought satellite radio makes you cool.  Now you guys acting like faggots.  No, no.  I will accept that from him. 
[03:45:00]  I always listen to you guys.  They know you guys support me.  You support Tara.  Yeah, well, the problem is...  And you guys are like, oh, we got a time trip.  We got to hurry.  Listen to us, tough guy.  The show's ending, and that's it.  If you don't like it, fuck off.  Oh, you're really tough when I'm not calling in there, right?  Exactly.  Yeah, I'll come there right now.  Where is he?  Very close, Evan.  Look, I got to get out of here right now.  Remember, the Italian-looking one said all that. 
[03:45:30]  I did not.  You certainly did.  I'm the one that's...  Honestly, Evan, you know we love you, and we support you guys.  But the problem is they really do cut the show off right at 10 o'clock in Washington.  It's a satellite thing.  I know, but, you know, first of all, we don't know that publicist girl.  She doesn't work for us.  Oh, really?  And she told me a half an hour ago, before we got in the fucking tunnel, she said,  I'll call whatever you want.  It's real loose.  She said it's real cool.  He told me.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
