<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, paying tribute to the recently deceased comedian and ventriloquist Otto Peterson.  Studio guests Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine, along with a phone call from David Copperfield, shared anecdotes about Otto, including a memorable incident where his puppet George was stabbed.  The pre-show also touched upon the upcoming "Unmasked" event with Ron Bennington, featuring pre-signed posters which sparked some disagreement regarding the rushed meet-and-greet format.  Listener calls and interactions with the unusually grumpy E-Rock (aka Sex Bagel, aka Hawk) dominated a significant portion of the pre-show.  Jim Norton's surprising lack of musical knowledge, the hosts' perspectives on parenting, and Courtney Love's criticism of saxophones in rock were also discussed.  Sal successfully pranked E-Rock into believing he was a caller.  Technical problems and the absence of Anthony and Travis due to illness concluded the pre-show, leading to further discussion about the limited-edition "Unmasked" posters.

The main show commenced with Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts criticizing the design of the "OA20" 20th-anniversary poster, noting its small size and the prominence of various comedians like Sam Kinison,  Bobby Kelly, Burr, Patrice Attell, Louis C.K., Fallon, John Cena, Guy Fieri, and Hulk Hogan, while their staff, especially E-Rock, received minimal representation.  The discussion devolved into a debate about the poster's limited edition status, with Opie and Anthony advocating for wider distribution.  Listener calls, including one from a fan whose husband disliked the show, punctuated the segment, along with digressions about a Chip and Uncle Paul podcast, the health of show personnel, technical issues, and the upcoming "Unmasked" show.  Rich Voss was mentioned as an upcoming guest; eventually Sam agreed to increase poster availability.  Further planning for the "Unmasked" show, a potential larger future event, and Rich Voss's upcoming appearance and stand-up gigs concluded this segment.

The next segment included numerous commercial breaks for Lumosity, WeatherTech, and other products, interspersed with a discussion about Otto Peterson. Rich Vos, a friend of Otto, joined in studio, sharing anecdotes about Otto's "filthy dirty" comedic style, drug use (cocaine and heroin), and his relationship with George the dummy.  He recounted stories involving Chris Rock and other comedians, and detailed Otto's interactions with audiences.  Colin Quinn called in, adding his own Otto stories.  A clip from a podcast featuring Jim Norton’s ex-girlfriend, Jennifer, interviewing Chip Chipperson, was played, revealing explicit details of their past relationship. More commercial breaks followed.

A lengthy and rambling conversation with Chip followed. The segment began with Chip unknowingly recounting graphic details about his mother's sexual activities before discussing his disappointing childhood birthday party.  The conversation then shifted to a man in Boston who placed a backpack near the marathon finish line (Kayvon Edson), causing a brief evacuation.  The hosts expressed disgust at Edson's actions.  The show then promoted upcoming events and took listener calls, interspersed with discussions about the Boston incident and a viral video of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant's inappropriate safety announcement.  The hosts and callers debated the flight attendant's performance.

The discussion regarding the flight attendant continued with Rich Voss expressing his disapproval, viewing it as an insult to radio personalities, while others defended her humor and potential.  Callers shared varying opinions. The segment then focused on viral videos: Sweet Brown's "Ain't nobody got time for that" video and a "car guy" YouTube video with the catchphrase "Would you look at that?"  Christopher Maloney and Dean Norris from the movie "Small Time" joined the show, discussing the film, their careers (including Norris’ *Breaking Bad* role), and used car salesmen. A caller shared a revenge story about a customer's leather gloves.  The segment concluded with further discussion about the viral videos and the guests.

A segment heavily featured Rich Voss recounting an awkward encounter with Dean Norris, repeatedly failing to remember the name of the movie (*The Counselor*) they met at.  Banter among the hosts, listener calls promoting Rich Voss's stand-up shows and an Otto podcast, a $44 million blue painting, a listener's complaint about Voss's interaction with a flight attendant, more discussion of Otto's death, and the mention of Dominic Ancel's new Easter treat filled the segment, punctuated by numerous commercial breaks.  The broadcast concluded without any further summarized segments.

[00:01:00]  And prepare for the incomparable Opie and Anthony show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  With Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Welcome to the pre-show indeed.  Counting down the minutes before Opie and Anthony hits the airwaves on this Wednesday, April 16th. 
[00:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  We are live, which means you can be a part of this thing.  Call up now, 866-WOW1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  As we get into everything that's going on in the world of Opie and Anthony, which means everything that's going down today on the show.  And everything we learned yesterday.  All the things that happened yesterday that will better educate us as to what today will hold. 
[00:02:00]  Because as we all know, there is no radio show more unpredictable than the Opie and Anthony show.  All we can do is use yesterday's show as a guideline for what may go down today.  So if you want to do that with me, feel free to call in right now.  866-WOW1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Yesterday was, I think, a very important show.  We did a lot of talking about Otto. 
[00:02:30]  Otto Peterson from Otto and George who passed away over the weekend.  And I think Opie's statement at the beginning of the show said it all about the fan base.  Because, you know, Opie probably more than Ant and Jim.  But the whole show really complains, and rightfully so, by the way.  Because I would agree with them about the negativity of our fan base.  I mean, you all are a very fickle bunch.  I know for a fact that you have to condition yourself to not put any credence on Instagram and YouTube comments and Twitter feedback and things like that. 
[00:03:00]  Only because we all know all you maniacs are just looking for whatever flaws that you can find to point out.  Whatever you can do to get under our skin.  For some reason, the fans of the Opie and Anthony show love to see the people associated with the Opie and Anthony show get all riled up.  I've never quite understood it, but you just learn to live with it until something serious happens and the fans kind of come together. 
[00:03:30]  This is what Opie had to say about it at the very beginning of yesterday's show.  I just want to say quickly that the O&A community is strong.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, man.  Everyone steps up when it really matters.  We're a bunch of assholes, obviously, and we all take our shots left and right.  But yesterday, man, the love on Twitter for Otto was just amazing. 
[00:04:00]  I like that.  Just want to acknowledge that.  They're good eggs when they need to be.  Really good eggs.  Scumbag prick wads all the rest of the time.  Well, even those guys kind of pushed it down a little bit yesterday.  Yeah.  Even those guys.  They really did.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what you realize.  When stuff like this happens, the fans that love to just be awful human beings, even they kind of pipe down when this is going on. 
[00:04:30]  And you go, wait a minute.  They're just trolling.  That's how you know the whole time.  They're just trying to get under your skin.  They're just going on the Internet and trying to get you riled up.  You can't take it too seriously.  We had Bob Kelly in studio yesterday, as well as Jim Florentine, and David Tell was on the phone, all talking about their memories of Otto Peterson and what they – not only how he impacted them, but just working with him. 
[00:05:00]  He was, as we've been saying all week, really, we found out Tuesday, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.  What was that?  No, Monday.  We found out Monday that he had passed away, and since then, one of the – there have been two really key points in describing Otto.  One is what a nice guy he was and how much he cared about comedians and the art form.  And two was that he was the guy that comedians went to when they needed to laugh. 
[00:05:30]  We had Florentine and Otto – not Otto, Bob Kelly in to talk about Otto yesterday, and they were kind of talking about his health in his final days, which we all thought was good.  Let's go to track 10.  How was he doing?  He was doing great.  That's what I thought.  You know, I would see him at least three times a month.  We'd go over there during the day.  We'd hang out, and he was totally, you know, sober.  He did a gig Friday night.  Yeah.  According to his Twitter.  Wow. 
[00:06:00]  He had a lot of gigs lined up.  He was in great shape.  Look, he had that, you know, the bacterial meningitis thing happened about 10 months ago.  Right.  Like last Memorial Day.  And, you know, he was basically in a coma for a week.  Right.  On a ventilator and everything.  They didn't think he was going to make it.  So I don't know if that, you know, affected his health.  Right.  Later on.  I don't know how much damage that does on the inside.  Right.  Probably did something to his brain.  And, you know, we don't know what happened, but, you know, it was in the afternoon yesterday.  So it wasn't like he was out partying all night.  Right.  It was Sunday afternoon when this happened.  So it wasn't like.  Yeah.  Last time we saw him, he was right there. 
[00:06:30]  He was great.  Funny as all hell.  And it didn't seem like anything was going on.  Nothing at all.  It didn't seem like it sort of down at all.  No, you know, and they were worried that with the bacterial meningitis that he wasn't,  you know, his brain wasn't going to function right after that.  Oh, God.  And he came out of it 100%.  Oh, absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That was very rare.  It was only like a 10% shot of getting it all back.  Right.  Florentine was right there.  He was 100%.  And if you were listening to yesterday's show, we closed with Otto Peterson's last appearance  on O&A. 
[00:07:00]  And that was after the meningitis.  He came in several months after he was hospitalized and had recovered.  And, you know, like everybody was saying, he was healthy.  He was with it.  He did the show.  He stayed for the after show.  I mean, he was the same guy that he's always been, which is why this was kind of such a surprise.  Because the only silver lining to moments like this is getting to hear guys like Florentine  and Bobby Kelly and Dave Attell and everybody reflect and tell stories about the life of 
[00:07:30]  somebody like Otto and how, what really struck them and Opie and Anthony and Jim.  You know, I don't want to not mention them.  But they get into the stories that are just, I mean, hilarious.  Listen to this story.  Of course, Otto had his puppet, George.  He's a ventriloquist.  And George would be the one who would get people upset.  George would be the one who said things that were most offensive, even about Otto himself. 
[00:08:00]  So, they had a story about George once getting stabbed while Otto was performing in the street.  Let's go to track 11.  Do you know the story of Otto getting stabbed in Central Park, or George, actually, Buddha?  Yeah, what's up?  How do you know this story?  Because he told me.  I used to do comedy, quarantine in North Carolina.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, okay.  I was at Pips, and I got off stage.  Now, Pips, you get heckled ridiculously. 
[00:08:30]  And I was, like, ready to hang myself because it never happened to me.  I was only doing comedy three months, and Otto was on the side.  And he liked me, and he came up to me.  And I've been friends with him since then.  But he said to me, he goes, don't worry about getting heckled.  You'll get heckled all the time.  I'm like, yeah, why have you been heckled?  He goes, heckled.  At one time, I was in Central Park.  I was, like, 19, 18 years old.  And he was doing Puerto Rican jokes.  And some dude got pissed, took a knife out, and stabbed the puppet. 
[00:09:00]  And I said to him, I go, what did you say to him?  You know, there was a crowd around.  And he looked right at the guy and goes, this cocksucker thinks I'm real.  That's what a good, that's how valued show business, the whole show, was the thing for Otto.  Because most people, when they were confronted with a guy who was stabbing their puppet and had a knife in their hand, would probably run away screaming or would cry or would urinate themselves. 
[00:09:30]  Otto, on the other hand, used it as an opportunity to get another joke off.  I call him a cocksucker.  Oh, it's too much.  Rich Voss will be in studio today.  I'm sure he'll be talking about Otto, among other things.  But he'll be in a little bit later on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, we didn't only talk to comedians about Otto yesterday.  He touched a lot of people's lives.  And it was amazing how many people were fans of his.  We got David Copperfield on the show. 
[00:10:00]  He called in.  David Copperfield has never done Opie and Anthony before.  But he found out we were doing a tribute show, as it were, for Otto and wanted to be a part of it.  So we got David Copperfield on the phone.  And this is what he had to say.  I started doing the trotism, and I totally sucked at it.  I couldn't do it.  My act was out of the back of a boy's life in a magazine.  Nobody laughed.  And I found magic.  But in Otto's case, he really found a voice. 
[00:10:30]  He found a voice of how to do that and kind of a repartee that became distinctive to him and really had that ability.  And, you know, as I got to know him, I realized not from him.  He never talked about this, but, you know, he's one of the most ripped-off guys around.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And some famous people who I won't mention the name of, but you'll know who it is, like, literally became famous on his material. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, really became famous on it.  And stuff that he developed and was amazing.  And for a magician, you know, that's what I do, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  And when in the magic world, if somebody, you know, rips off what I'm doing, it's devastating because I spend years on each thing.  So I ask Otto, I think, you know, so-and-so got really famous on your act.  How did you deal with that?  I mean, how do you do that?  And he would say, it's okay.  You know, I was done with it.  It's all right.  I said, what?  Are you kidding? 
[00:11:30]  I mean, you know, this person is enormously famous, and he's using your material that you developed.  Oh, it's okay.  It's all right.  I said, oh, my God.  This guy was a really giving guy that really was okay with all that kind of roll with the punches and didn't, you know, get pissed off at this kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Amazing, amazing stuff.  And I know you guys know what I'm talking about, but it's, like, incredible.  And that's the other thing.  David Copperfield, we asked him, how did you get to know...  Otto, how did you become aware of him? 
[00:12:00]  He goes, Kevin Spacey turned me on to him.  Frank Underwood was a fan of Otto and George.  I mean, the amount of people that this guy just struck a chord with in a positive way, it's amazing.  You just don't see stuff like this, especially from somebody like Otto, who was so sort of down-to-earth and humble.  Like, you would never imagine the amount and the quality of people in terms of fame that he had interacted with. 
[00:12:30]  Really incredible.  And you could tell, too, the things that he would bring out in people.  Because you heard David Copperfield there.  I mean, he's being real, and he's talking about people stealing material and things like that, which you don't normally hear magicians talk about.  But he's also a family-friendly guy, and you can tell, you know, he's a family-friendly act.  He's not cursing.  He's not talking about any of the vulgar stuff.  Listen to David Copperfield laugh as we retell one of Otto's jokes. 
[00:13:00]  And he has such a great mastery of the language.  The craftsmanship was just great, and you guys are experts at it.  You know, everybody on the phone with me here, you just know.  It's the choice of how he phrased it and how he did it was genius, kind of genius.  He had to have a porcelain sink.  Yeah.  And then he had that famous line.  He said, I want to fuck you in the ass with a Santa hat on.  Why?  Why would a Santa hat on?  Why?  It was so, or literally Otto would be minding his own business just saying something. 
[00:13:30]  And George would just interrupt him and go, you know, every time you talk, this show sucks.  I'm going to fuck you in the ass until there's blood in your shoes.  I'm like, what a great image that is.  Like, that's a fucking poem.  Like, to fuck you in the ass is harsh, but until there's blood in your shoes.  That means it went all the way down your thighs, over your calves, and collected in your shoes.  Took us to a whole new level.  That's a harsh ass fucking.  Oh, my God.  David Copperfield's laughing.  That's brutality.  But he really understood that. 
[00:14:00]  He just knew how to write brilliant material like that and amazing lines.  It's poetic in its own way.  It becomes poetry, you know.  I was right there with Opie.  I can't tell you how happy it made me that David Copperfield was laughing at the blood in the shoes joke.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Let's go to Eddie on Long Island.  Eddie, welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, Sam Bo, the young king of radio.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm doing the pre-show right now.  What are you doing? 
[00:14:30]  Excellent.  Just chilling.  Yeah, so, I mean, obviously, Otto was hysterical.  And to say a day, how can I get a not Sam shirt?  You can go to my website.  Thank you, Eddie.  I appreciate the call.  Eddie, that was just classless.  But I'll accept it.  Big event coming up for Opie and Anthony this week.  And I'm sure that we're going to, I hope anyway, I can't say I'm sure, but I hope that we're going to talk a lot about the unmasked today on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:15:00]  So, of course, Ron Bennington is going to sit down with Opie and Anthony at Caroline's on Broadway tomorrow afternoon.  If you have tickets, you're lucky.  If you don't, I don't see you getting them.  But it will be broadcast live here on the Opie and Anthony channel as well as on Raw Dog, Sirius XM 99.  But I think it's going to be a bigger event than Opie and Anthony are giving it credit for.  I mean, how often do Opie and Anthony sit down for a proper interview? 
[00:15:30]  How often do you get to hear them really not only tell the stories of radio that they've done over the last 20 years,  but do it in a context where they have a master interviewer like Ron Bennington asking them the questions?  You know what I mean?  Like guiding them as they tell the story.  I don't think it's ever happened before.  And I don't know in this context if it'll ever happen again.  But it's going to be, I think, classic must-listen-to radio. 
[00:16:00]  Opie and Anthony, however, as is no surprise, were not necessarily as positive on it.  And they haven't been, as I am.  And that was evident yesterday as they explained unmasked to Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine.  That's track 12.  Do you know by the time it really gets started and everything, it's going to be nothing.  Did you hear about the posters yet?  What? 
[00:16:30]  What?  We're just going to sit here after tomorrow's show, I think, and sign 300 posters.  That's fun.  That'd be fun.  Guys get a couple of, some coffee.  Get some Sharpies and just talk.  Because I'll tell you why.  Because we don't have enough time after the gig.  To just sign them.  So it's going to be like, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  You guys are doing a fucking shitty meet and greet?  Yeah.  Well, the Carolines has to be cleared by 7.  For what?  We have another show.  So it's the show.  We're going to pre-sign the posters, because that'll take too much time. 
[00:17:00]  So they can say hi really fast, grab a poster, and get the fuck out.  On a fucking Thursday?  We're very grateful to this company.  And they said photos will be taken, but it's going to be taken with one of our cameras and posted on a website that they could download.  That's actually a smart idea.  That's a smart idea.  I do like that when I read it.  Jimmy does that.  And I think it's good doing it the other way.  It's a good camera.  You upload the pictures to the fucking website.  It's a little impersonal. 
[00:17:30]  It's a little more personal when you take a photo and they have it right there on their phone.  They can do whatever they want.  They can put it on their phone later.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck them and they're personal.  Stop bumming us out.  It's going to be an amazing event Thursday.  It's great that you guys pre-signed the fucking, you can't get to anybody.  Pre-sign.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why don't you just get a stamp, you fucking piece of shit?  That's a good idea.  It's fucking, it's not us.  We've got Greg and Anthony and a fucking chip stamp.  Just sitting there.  The one thing we're good at is sitting around and signing and bullshit with the listeners. 
[00:18:00]  That's great.  That's one thing we've always done well.  But not this time, man.  It is going to be fucking in and out.  In and out.  Is it sold out?  Of course.  You know, I listen to you guys when, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all fruit takers.  That might actually be a blessing.  I know.  Do it every day.  I'd love to hear it, but you've got to go.  You know, you got me through some tough times.  Oh, really?  Come on the way up the steps.  Later, later.  Back in 98, you guys were, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle.  Let's chatter, people.  He's going to just be pushing your back.  Yeah, leave your talking hats at home.  You're going to be able to get a photo with Obi and Anthony if you're going, but that's  about as much as you're going to be able to get.  But look, a lot of times people don't even get to do that.  You know, a lot of times people don't even get to take photos with their radio heroes.  So I think that's a very special thing, as a matter of fact.  Plus, it's going to be taken with the nice professional cameras. 
[00:19:00]  It'll be a good photo.  I think it's going to be a great event.  But my favorite event is actually going on right now.  E-Rock, a.k.a. the Sex Bagel, a.k.a. the Hawk, is answering phones for me in here.  And I've never seen anyone be so ornery about it.  I mean, it's 18 minutes after the hour, which means he couldn't have been answering phones  for longer than 18 minutes today.  And I've never seen anybody so upset about it.  He's picking up, like, I'm listening to him.  I don't know.  Just tell me your damn name. 
[00:19:30]  And he's hanging up on people and going, pre-show, who's this?  Like, as if you guys have really put him out by calling in.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  If you want to call up, the Hawk is on the job.  And we start with Paul in Utah.  What's up, Paul?  Yeah, in the morning.  Sam, I'm just wondering if ONA are doing Unmasked tomorrow afternoon,  are they going to be doing a live show in the morning,  or are we going to be stuck with a rerun? 
[00:20:00]  Listen, I'm going to tell you something about Opie and Anthony  and the workhorses of satellite radio that they are.  A lot of people like to take their Fridays off,  regardless of what they're doing on Thursday.  Some people take their Fridays off after also taking their Thursdays off.  Opie and Anthony are doing the Unmasked on Thursday afternoon.  And as of today, they will be in for a live Friday morning show just for you, Paul.  I thought about tomorrow morning.  They do a live show tomorrow morning.  Oh.  Tomorrow morning? 
[00:20:30]  They will also be live.  Five live shows and an Unmasked.  Five and an Unmasked.  Who's doing six shows a week?  Who doesn't?  All right.  We'll get my money's worth.  Fantastic.  That's right.  That's right.  Roland, are you laughing at E-Rock being ornery answering calls over there?  Someone got slob out.  I didn't think that would happen.  Super fan Eric, welcome.  Oh, God damn it, Shane.  I'm so fired up.  Eric was the one that hung up on me.  Eric, why'd you hang up on super fan Eric? 
[00:21:00]  Do you fucking know him?  He's what?  Why'd you hang up on super fan Eric?  Oh, was he the asshole going, you don't know who this is?  Oh, super fan Eric, E-Rock said that he hung up on you because you were saying, you don't  know who this is?  It's me.  You don't know?  He asked me who it was.  He said, you don't know who this is?  I said, you don't know who this is?  He hung up on me.  God damn it, you don't hang up on the super fan.  I'm here for the people.  That's right.  What are you doing today?  I'm doing hoagies.  I'm glad to hear it.  I'll tell you what super fan... 
[00:21:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It's cold out.  Listen, it's cold out, baby, but I got shorts on today because that's my role.  I'm 24-7, 365, I'm in shorts.  Are you a heavier gentleman?  Eh, not really.  All right.  Maybe a little bit.  Just a short guy.  Maybe a little bit.  I'm fired up, man.  You're fired up.  It's all good.  I'll tell you what.  How about this, super fan Eric, for being such a good guy and for Eric hanging up on  you, I'm going to put you on hold and I'm going to give you a copy of Ride Along on  Blu-ray.  Ooh.  That's the Kevin Hart movie.  It's very funny.  Ride Along. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, well, thank you very much.  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold, super fan Eric.  E-Rock is going to get to you whenever he gets a chance because right now the phones  are exploding ever since they found out that E-Rock is being a little ornery this morning  with his call screening duties.  I did also want to bring up something that I found interesting.  Probably the most interesting part of yesterday's show was the fact Sal just, Sal just, Eric,  it's Sal on his cell phone. 
[00:22:30]  He was sitting there.  Here's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.  I don't know if you heard mumbling off mic and Sal is giggling now.  Sal is sitting right next to Eric as Eric screens calls.  And by the way, Eric, I don't know why you hung up on all the slobo calls.  I don't think that's fair to the people.  But Sal just called up.  He's sitting right next to Eric.  And Eric goes, pre-show, who's this?  And Sal says, Sal, while he's sitting next to Eric.  And Sal goes, okay, Sal, where are you from?  And Sal, sitting next to Eric, goes, New York. 
[00:23:00]  Eric goes, okay, New York, what do you got for the show?  And Sal is just giggling because he can't believe this is working.  And just goes, oh, fuck you.  That's when Eric turns around and looks at him like, oh, you asshole.  You piece of garbage.  Oh, well, yesterday, as I was saying on the show, it's a madhouse around here in our tiny little closet pre-show studio.  Yesterday, what really struck me, I had no idea the bubble that Jim was living in was so thick that it could not be penetrated by pop culture. 
[00:23:30]  And there's something admirable about this because Jim simply surrounds himself with the things that he likes.  But I've never seen anybody be able to do it so effectively.  We were watching a clip of Pharrell, who's got the happy song now, on Oprah yesterday.  And listening to some of his songs to prove to Jim that Pharrell had been making massive hits for many years. 
[00:24:00]  Listen to Jim's response to some of these mega songs.  It's so despicable me, too.  I've never heard this.  You've heard it?  No.  Wait for the hook.  Oh.  Guarantee you've heard this.  Wow.  With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way.  Because I'm happy.  Club alone, if you feel.  No.  That's a no from Jim Norton.  No, I've never heard it. 
[00:24:30]  How do you avoid this song?  Let's not have these boneyards.  No, but just, they play it everywhere.  Sounds very, do you sound very Jamiroquai?  Right.  Very Jamiroquai sounding.  Wait, you don't know this song either?  No, I know this song.  Okay.  Just walking into a store, you've had to hear this, or heard this.  No, this is not bad.  I just haven't heard it.  He also did Nothing by Nori.  Right.  Beautiful Snoop Dogg.  He's a dud.  I don't know any of these songs. 
[00:25:00]  No, you are a dud, not him.  These are huge hits.  This guy's a bomb maker.  Girlfriend by NSYNC.  Oh, Snooze.  Rock Your Body.  I don't know that.  Justin Simberlake.  How's that go?  You want to put on Rock Your Body?  I don't know it.  Travis.  I really didn't know the other one.  You know this one.  Stink.  Fuck you, girl.  Fuck it.  I just don't know how you avoid pop songs.  It amazes me.  This song was everywhere, too. 
[00:25:30]  This might be Justin Simberlake's biggest hit.  Yeah, you don't have to download it or anything, but just walking around, it's in stores, it's  coming out of cars.  It's not even a good song.  It was a huge song for him.  This is not better than, what was the other one, the back, something back?  Sexy back?  That one I liked.  That was after this.  Okay, well that one I knew.  I didn't know this one.  And he went on and on.  If you haven't heard it, listen on demand or over the weekend when we'll air it again.  He went on and on, song after song, having no idea, none of the Gwen Stefani songs, none 
[00:26:00]  of the Snoop Dogg songs.  And my thing was, you don't have to like these songs.  I understand that they're not your taste and that they're kind of teeny bopper songs, but  to not know that they exist is crazy.  They're on every commercial, they're in every movie.  It's amazing.  Let's start running through some of these calls that actually made it through.  Eric was a machine over there.  You were letting nobody through over that last five to ten minutes.  What was going on over there? 
[00:26:30]  Non-phone calls.  What do you mean non-phone calls?  It's just people screaming, me or superfan Eric.  They're all screaming.  Was it one of them, Roland?  Roland called from three different phones.  Eric just said that Roland, our talent booker, called him from three different phones because  he's finding out that Eric is so crabby when he answers the calls.  Mike in South Carolina.  Yeah, how you doing, Sam?  Good.  Second time caller here.  Listen, it's fascinating to listen to you guys talk about the comedy and how a lot of you 
[00:27:00]  guys started out in comedy.  And I'm a big movie guy and I like to watch the documentaries of the making of movies.  And that movie, Funny People, I was watching it and the guy made a big deal about it.  He only had one chance to do this and do it right.  And they put a lot of money into that.  Just wanted to get your take.  Is that a realistic kind of way that people come up in that business?  I think it is in a way. 
[00:27:30]  I love that movie.  It's a great movie, man.  It's fucking hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really good.  And I like the whole story of somebody coming from, you know, being a young comic and trying  to get five minutes and kind of being shitty and then, you know, being able to write for  somebody.  And just, I think it is one way that people come up in the comedy business.  The only thing, a lot of comedians I've talked to have said that they don't like that there  aren't more comedians in the movie.  In the movie itself, yeah.  Yeah, but I... 
[00:28:00]  That was Aptow, right?  Yeah.  I forgot.  Aptow.  And he was actually a comedian, correct?  Yeah, he was a stand-up at first.  Okay.  Because he had a lot of the people that were in that movie, the actors and actresses,  he made them do stand-up to prep for the movie.  Yeah.  Well, that's interesting.  I just wanted to make sure that was a realistic kind of take on it.  I mean, it's realistic to me, but I haven't really come up through the business like some  of these other guys.  Also, I love pretty much everything Judd Apatow does, so I'm going to be a little biased. 
[00:28:30]  Snowy in Michigan.  Samuel, how are you doing this morning, sir?  Good.  I didn't even know you were up with on screening calls.  He wasn't crabby with me.  Maybe these people are stuck using Slobo.  Maybe he wouldn't be so angry at me.  Yeah, I mean, Snowy, I think that you bring a smile to everybody's face.  Easy.  You're talking about how at the end of this unmasked, they're going to be kind of rushing  people out.  It reminded me of that old Saturday Night Live gift.  They're going, buh-bye.  Yeah.  Here's your poster.  Buh-bye.  Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for so long. 
[00:29:00]  That's great.  Buh-bye.  Buh-bye.  Buh-bye.  I hope they do that.  While we still have a minute or two, I wanted to play this because Roland gave Eric a hard  time.  So I figured we would play the clip of Opie and Anthony giving Roland a hard time.  Let's listen to Anthony trashing Samsung's white glove service from yesterday.  Does that make you feel a little better, Eric?  Yeah, Eric's all for it.  Roland always gives the guys free stuff.  And I do wonder sometimes if he panics when they don't say the most glowing things about 
[00:29:30]  it.  Here's Ant talking about white glove service yesterday.  Where's your Samsung?  Why are you on an iPhone if you've got the white glove?  What is the white glove treatment?  We get everything.  What is that?  I got a watch.  I got the new Note 3.  I could get TVs and I'm getting the Samsung 5.  They gave us a Note 3 and I don't feel like walking around with a plasma TV in my fucking  pocket.  You know, that phone.  It's ridiculous.  I actually, that phone, that's the one that makes me want to switch. 
[00:30:00]  What?  That fucking, yeah.  I don't care it's big.  I love that it's big.  It fits my pocket, so I don't care.  It's great.  Why wouldn't you want a bigger phone?  No.  I love it.  What?  You don't want it bulky in your pocket.  It's not bulky.  Look how thin this thing is.  It's going to be spring.  It's lighter than the iPhone and it takes up just as much space.  I'm not, no one's throwing their back out lifting a phone.  It doesn't matter.  Hold it.  Hold it.  It really isn't.  My left arm isn't bigger because I've been holding my iPhone.  I love when fucking Florentine gets aggravated and stuff like that.  It makes very logical. 
[00:30:30]  So much sense.  I know.  It's lighter.  So look how lighter it is.  It's lighter than the iPhone.  Isn't it lighter than the iPhone?  I can't hold it up that long, you know?  I've got to keep switching hands.  It's really light.  But you've got to have long fingers to get all the way over.  That's the problem.  You've got to use your thumb in your...  It's not a problem, though, because they figured that out and you can switch your phone.  You've got to style it.  Peter Sinklage hates that phone.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, does he.  That sounds great.  I love that phone.  And I love the watch, too.  I like the watch.  The watch is pretty cool.  But I'm not going to wear the watch.  You will wear the watch.  I'll wear the watch when I'm driving because you can do hands-free phone calls and stuff. 
[00:31:00]  But I don't need the watch to...  It's great.  You have a kid.  You're fucking just talking to your wrist.  I'll tell you something, though.  It's just not as quick and intuitive as the iPhone is.  I've used both.  Oh, you're going to ruin our white gloves.  No, no.  I meant for...  Make believe.  I meant for people...  Just make believe.  Chinese people.  Roland is having a panic attack.  Oh, shit.  Get the white glove treatment and you're fucking trashing it.  Well, maybe the five.  I get a fucking shit glove treatment from anybody.  Roland texted me and said he does indeed panic. 
[00:31:30]  I'd like to get into that with him maybe on the post-show.  Maybe today on the O&A show.  We've got a lot to get into today, though.  As I said, Rich Voss will be in studio.  I'm sure we'll talk about ACDC and they might be done.  Another one that I want to hear Roland's take on was Courtney Love came out and said,  saxophones have no place in rock and roll.  So Bruce Springsteen can basically go fuck himself is what she implied. 
[00:32:00]  I'd love to hear what Roland thinks about that.  We didn't get to the flight attendant doing stand-up comedy and Sal found this hilarious  video analyzing what celebrity DJs actually do when they're in concert.  They do about as much performing.  It's like Britney Spears.  You know, she always lip syncs, but at least she dances.  So you're like, okay, well, she'd be out of breath if she was singing.  It's not the case with these DJs.  We'll get into all that and a whole lot more up next because that's when the Opie and Anthony 
[00:32:30]  show begins.  Okay.  You got to hit the thing, you know, otherwise it sounds awkward, you know, because the Opie  and Anthony show starts right now.  Now, actually about 30 seconds ago is when it was supposed to start.  Oh, just boost that up a little bit because the Opie and Anthony show, my faded out, the 
[00:33:00]  bed faded out.  I'll give it to you again.  The Opie and Anthony show is a, well, thank you for listening to the post show today.  Maybe this was Eric's bad vibes that did this on the phone.  Eric being crabby on the phones.  I can't do this.  Mucked up the works.  Okay.  When should I say right now?  Say right now.  Okay.  Right.  Because the Opie and Anthony show begins right now. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good.  I didn't sound that good. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you. 
[00:36:00]  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you. 
[00:37:30]  We know we're on now.  We're talking.  E-Rock, are we on now?  E-Rock comes running in.  We're on now.  And then he gets mad at us.  We're sitting here talking.  He walks and goes, we're on now.  How?  He's slow.  He really isn't an observant person.  He's on a break, kid.  He's got a good heart.  All right, well.  He means well.  Here's the deal.  It snowed in New York, which is fucking nuts. 
[00:38:00]  About an inch.  He's got an inch.  He's got an inch.  He's got an inch.  He's got an inch.  Well, I mean, it didn't really stick, but it's on all the cars, which is crazy.  Dillette's not working, which is our system that kind of runs the radio show.  What is there?  Bugs in the system?  Ghosts in the machine?  Yeah, I couldn't end the pre-show.  Your fucking mic sounds horrible, so let's add that to the list.  Content-wise.  Is it the voice?  Yeah.  No, it's what's coming out of it.  Sounds extremely weak.  Mm-hmm.  Talk again. 
[00:38:30]  Hello?  Very weak, Sam.  You're way low in the mix, so that's another problem.  How am I in the mix, O.P.?  You sound good.  Thank you.  I almost said unfortunately, but that's just not nice because I love Jim Norton.  I know, but you still should have said it.  I know, but I just like to be a dick to be a dick.  Would have hurt my feelings a little.  Anthony's not here.  He's under the weather.  Travis is not here.  He's under the weather.  Jim Norton is here, but is under the weather.  I'm not 100% sick, but I feel the sore throat and a little bit of a cough coming out. 
[00:39:00]  I felt it last night, and I feel a bit sluggish today.  And we got Rich Foss coming in.  So this is a complete fucking disaster today.  What did I do?  A complete fucking disaster.  It's not nice.  Here's the thing.  You need me today.  Here's the thing.  Mars, what's going on with the studio?  Yeah, we're not happy with Mars.  The lead problem happened on air.  I mean, I tested everything.  It just happened, right?  I haven't heard of it.  Why are you fiddling? 
[00:39:30]  You're fiddling.  You really are panicking over there.  I'm changing our headphones.  I didn't know he wasn't coming in.  Yeah, he's not here, so you don't have to do that right now.  Yeah.  There's no one that's going to be sitting there.  How about me?  I'm talking on the mic right now.  Yeah, but you know it.  You know, Mars has secret dreams that he's going to sit down and undiscovered talent.  Like, he'll be a really cool behind-the-scenes story someday.  I could dream, can't I?  Yeah.  And I was just plugging something in, and they'll say something.  Like, hey, you sound like some celebrities.  Do some impressions.  You only have one good story.  That's it.  Which was what?  Your mom beating the shit out of you. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I like that.  And that's why you're a big MMA fighter now, or trainer.  You train MMA, I should say.  Yes.  Then you can kick everyone's ass in studio, and it all is because your mom beat the shit  out of you.  What, your head was stuck under the stereo cabinet, and she just started wailing away on you?  That is correct.  It's a fun story.  Really?  Yeah.  You gotta love that.  I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.  Yeah.  So you should be a comedian.  What's wrong with you?  The fuck?  I'm not that funny. 
[00:40:30]  But those are the type of things that make you go and do stand-up.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I know a lot more.  Not look at wires and switches.  I would choose the one with the burning of my hands being a better story.  That's right.  He'd be his hands burning.  All right.  So you got two stories.  What was that again?  I forgot.  The spatula she dipped in oil.  What the fuck?  You guys are laughing.  I know.  That's wrong.  Why am I on her side?  I know I shouldn't be.  It's funny, right?  You survived.  You're good.  I did.  I became a better person. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, I didn't grow with those intentions of hurting my kids and stuff.  Oh, God, no.  I don't fucking touch my kids.  I don't yell because of my mom, which could be a problem.  No, I yell.  You yell at your kids?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You got to yell.  It's the only time they understand what the fuck I'm saying.  How many times did you want to hit them, though?  You get close.  Yeah.  As a parent, you're like, fuck, man.  I think one swat will take care of the situation right now.  Last week.  Last week.  Last week.  My boy almost closed the hatchback door on my daughter's head. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  And I saw it and I caught it and I fucking lost it.  I grabbed him and I just kept, I wanted to, but I just threatened him.  Dude, count down.  There's some real anger there.  You guys see that?  Yeah, he almost cracked her fucking skull, man.  How old is he?  He's eight.  How old is she?  Six.  Okay.  But he knew what the hell he was doing.  It was on purpose.  He saw her head and he kept coming down with the hatchback, you know, and then at the last  second he saw me freak out and he stopped. 
[00:42:00]  So, yeah, that was the only time.  You notice his eyes aren't focusing as he tells these stories?  Yeah.  I never noticed that.  Well, he noticed.  He noticed that was a bad thing.  That is a bad thing.  Eight years old is young, but it's like you're still,  aware enough to know that you're doing something you shouldn't be doing.  Right.  Man, you should be a parent.  No, I shouldn't be.  I make these great observations because I'm looking through the glass.  If I was standing inside the room, I probably would have just thrown the kid fucking into  the street and done a terrible job.  Raise kids like you raise cats. 
[00:42:30]  Just grab them and shake them.  Yeah, put my honey in their face and fart.  He'd be a good father, actually.  Probably.  But if they touch my Aussie stuff, he's out.  That, uh, look, I cut signature.  Out.  My kid was playing with my, uh, Dr. J basketball the other day.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Just get him one and write Dr. J on it.  He doesn't know.  No, he just thinks it's a basketball.  That's all.  Maybe I should put that one away because, uh, that's a special one for me. 
[00:43:00]  A glass.  It's been rolling around my apartment since he signed that ball.  That miniature ball for us.  Man, I grew up, uh, watching Dr. J, so I should, I should take care of that one.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, you have a few nice things displayed in there.  The boxing gloves are, you know, put away finally.  Good.  But the autographs are a bit smeared from all the playing the kids did with those.  That's what people don't understand.  When you become a parent, everything of yours is theirs, really.  You don't, when you're a good parent, you don't, you don't give a fuck. 
[00:43:30]  I got to play with whatever you want.  You know, and the stuff that you hold dear to your heart, then you have to put it away  because everything's up for granted.  Well, you put it on, if you put, mount something on the wall behind glass and they can't get to it.  Right, right.  But if you leave it laying around.  Yeah, I understand.  They don't know.  Fair game.  My, my wife lets, uh, my 18-month-old play with her iPhone.  It, I, I, I go crazy on that one.  Thank you.  Fuck that.  No.  I sit there and I'm having all sorts of panic attacks and stuff.  Yeah.  And she's just punching away because she, I mean, she could find some of her little, little apps that she needs  like PBS and Elmo and all that crap. 
[00:44:00]  But then I watch her and she's deleting apps and all sorts of crap's going on.  Exactly.  And then my wife's like, where's my iPhone?  And she's got the, the five and, and we'll find it like pretty much in the toilet or not  the toilet actually, but places like that.  Really bad places.  See, the iPhone wouldn't freak me out as much, even though it's a lot more valuable money-wise  because that's a replaceable thing.  As long as you back your shit up, it doesn't matter if they wreck it because it's very replaceable.  I, I, uh, I put all my valuables up way high and my wife hasn't learned that lesson yet. 
[00:44:30]  So a lot of her shit's getting broken.  And then she looks at me and I'm like, what do you want from me?  Exactly.  I mean, if you want them to play with your iPhone, that's up to you.  They're not touching my fucking galaxy note three here.  That's right.  They're not touching it.  Yeah.  That would freak me out.  It would, right?  Touch my stuff.  Yeah.  Like that's why people would rent those apartments out for strangers.  I'm like, how do you let strangers into your space?  I couldn't do it.  No.  Couldn't do it.  Well, people need money. 
[00:45:00]  No, I know.  I just get so territorial.  That's why Anthony surprises me.  The way he allows people into his home, because Ant doesn't like his shit touched.  I'm like, how do you allow people just to come in and hang out and walk around when  you get stuff on the table, your bills?  Right.  Couldn't do it.  Yeah.  I don't think, uh, I don't think a fan has ever been to my house.  I apologize to the fans for not opening my house to you.  Yeah.  But I just, I haven't had a court out of my house.  What's to be expected of you?  You don't need to apologize for that.  I apologize that I haven't opened my house to you yet.  Yeah.  But I don't trust you with my kids or anything else, so. 
[00:45:30]  Are you talking to me now?  You're referring to me?  I think you're in the fan.  You're in the fan column.  Yeah.  You think I'm a fan?  You're in the fan, almost friend category.  Yeah.  Almost.  Yeah.  How long has it been?  Uh, only, uh, going on 10 years.  10 years.  Only 10 years.  You've been working on it.  I've been working on it really hard, diligently.  I still haven't gotten a phone number.  No.  I have a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Puerto Ricans.  Yes, I can see that.  I'm sorry.  You knew it was race-related from the beginning?  Oh, from jump.  From jump?  What does that mean? 
[00:46:00]  From jump.  I knew there was a little bit of a problem with me.  Oh, God.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  I haven't done anything to this cat.  What the fuck did I do, right?  So I kept working along, and then finally, like about six months, eight months later,  I find out that his ex was Puerto Rican, and I said, ah.  Eureka?  Oh, Eureka.  What's Spanish for Eureka?  He was there at Christmas parties and shit.  Oh, forget about it.  You guys are a strange bunch.  They are strange.  Puerto Ricans are strange.  They are.  No offense to our Puerto Rican listeners, of course. 
[00:46:30]  You don't need to pluralize that.  Very strange.  I went to a Christmas party once, and I swear to you, hubcaps were handed out as Christmas  presents.  But let me tell you something.  And I know that's just an easy thing for a shock jock to say, but it is the God's honest  truth.  But let me...  Hubcaps.  And their defense, if you give me four mag tires now, that would be a great fucking present.  Honestly, I don't even know what a mag tire is. 
[00:47:00]  Like the rims?  Nice rims?  I have no idea.  Spinning and shit?  Are they the tiny, thin ones?  That would be a great gift for you?  Yeah.  Do you know how much you run for?  Are you a low rider?  Nah, not at all.  Let your car scrape on the road?  Nah, not at all.  You see the video of the one where there's two or three cars?  They can't hit a bump because they're that low?  I should have tweeted that video.  I didn't think we were going to talk about it today.  Maybe we can find it.  I was at the cell last night, and a girl walked in right before I went on that looked so much  like your ex.  Right.  It fucking threw me the entire set. 
[00:47:30]  And it wasn't because she was just a low, but I literally have never seen anybody resemble  another person that much.  Was she crying in the corner?  Because if she was, then that would have been her.  Oh, no.  She was just...  I didn't see her in the corner.  She just walked in.  We definitely need a visual, because when you bring her up, or I bring her up, you see  his eyes?  What?  He gets like...  His brows get...  Because I was stupid.  I stayed in a relationship way too fucking long.  I was a dummy.  She's a nice person or whatever. 
[00:48:00]  I don't really hate her, hate her or anything, but it just didn't work out.  And it should have not worked out many years before it didn't work out, if you know what  I mean.  You tried too hard.  And by the way, we are friends.  We just had a little heart-to-heart the other day.  Who, me and you?  Yeah.  We're just not going to do it outside this building.  Well, now you're breaking down the wall, man.  You're supposed to let people know that I don't have your number.  Oh.  But I really don't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know, whenever you see Blocked show up, you know who it is.  I'd say Colleagues. 
[00:48:30]  Colleagues?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's my work friend, Mars.  Okay.  Where's Travis today?  He's sick too, huh?  He's sick, yeah.  He's not feeling well.  What's going on?  I don't know.  I think it's going around.  Maybe it's the temperature change.  A little bug going around the studio.  All the guys got it.  Yeah.  Not me.  Oh, you will.  I had it.  Is Unmasked happening tomorrow with Anthony sick?  I told Anthony this morning when I spoke to him, I said, then the best thing for you  to do is to rest up.  Oh, God.  You know it's just a one-day sickness.  He'll be fine tomorrow.  Good. 
[00:49:00]  Because tomorrow...  I have no doubt.  He's got a big Unmask to do.  That's going to be a big show.  When do we have to sign the posters?  Today?  Yeah, I hope...  Anthony has to sign them tomorrow.  People might not get an Anthony autograph because he's sick today.  Yeah, good.  Straighten them right out.  Yeah.  Make them appreciate the Oasters and Jim's autographs a little bit more.  That's right.  It's rarer.  I'm going to...  Yeah, it's natural.  It's more rare.  I'm going to warm up my Opie stamp.  Cha-choon, cha-choon, cha-choon.  Why not?  Are you going to sign them on the air? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I guess.  Where are these posters?  I don't think we have them yet.  Don Wiki Wicklin will be here later this morning.  Okay.  With the posters?  I hope so.  And people want to know if they can get them online.  No.  Why?  We haven't made enough.  They're limited edition for...  Why does everything have to be limited edition?  Who cares?  If fans want the poster, they should be able to get the poster.  What makes it special?  It's a special treat for those that were lucky enough to attend Unmasked.  Yeah, but what about the people that weren't lucky enough?  At least you give them a poster and that would make them a little happier.  No, because it's limited edition. 
[00:50:00]  We don't need limited edition things.  It doesn't make sense.  Are those the posters?  I think we...  Yes, we have the posters.  Oh, what has Jimmy got?  A real autograph?  Remember we had Andy Summers on years ago from the police?  Right.  Thank you.  He was in yesterday, so I...  Oh, wow.  I mean, you've got to keep the posters limited because, like Jim said, you've got to make  things rare and exclusive and, like, look, I've got this special poster.  People will put it in a frame.  If we make them for everybody, everybody's going to just throw it out like yesterday's garbage. 
[00:50:30]  No, if we make it enough for everybody, we'll just realize how many are going to be left  over, and then it's humiliating.  But it really feels good to get rid of everything.  No more left.  I was sure we could get rid of 1,200.  I can't remember the last time in my life I ever said, oops, sold out.  Always available, should be my motto.  Stop the limited edition and all that.  It doesn't matter.  If fans want this poster, they should get this poster.  It's a special treat.  I'll tweet it.  It is pretty cool.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  And it's in, you know, in congratulations for your years in radio together.  In gyms, too.  I like this.  What happened?  What?  Oh, maybe.  Oh, you hit the tube.  I like the smell of a box of...  Now they're all bent.  I like this smell.  I just bent the corner.  Yeah.  Don't bend anything.  And where are we going to sign them?  What do you mean, where?  Right on the 20?  Wherever you want.  We can get...  I mean, they're like yellow.  They're a nice shade of piss yellow, so you can sign them with black markers. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, perfect for us.  Yeah.  Piss yellow.  You want to open them up?  You want to start signing or what?  Smell them.  I like the smell of posters and weird stuff like that.  Right.  I got to let the caffeine leave my veins before I start signing.  Why?  Jittery.  Oh, boy.  A little jittery signature.  I have a book.  Many years ago, when Richard Pryor wrote Prior Convictions and Other Life Sentences, he  couldn't sign because of his MS.  Right.  So he was stamping, but he just couldn't hold a pen.  And Jeff Ross did an event with him, and he got me a fucking prior... 
[00:52:00]  But I still count that as an autograph.  A stamp?  Yeah, because he couldn't physically...  Was he actually stamping?  It was Richard.  He was stamping, yeah.  Hmm.  Did you get a picture of him stamping?  No, but Jeff was there.  He's onto it.  But you're going to take his word for it?  Yeah, Jeff would never lie about stamped things.  Are you sure?  No, he'd lie about a lot of stuff, but never about something being stamped.  That's weird with Jeff.  All right.  I believe him.  So there you go.  The posters are ready to be signed.  Oh, yeah.  We're making more posters for the people. 
[00:52:30]  No, it's got to be limited edition.  The limited edition thing is stupid.  Building towards something else is stupid.  Why not make something special?  I don't mind special.  Special.  Let me smell.  How many people would actually want one of these?  Another maybe...  Probably less than in this box.  Maybe another thousand.  So what's the big deal?  No, there's going to be a lot of people who want these things.  Stop underestimating your audience.  So that's why we should just keep making them.  No.  I don't like holding shit back from the audience.  If they want it, they should get it. 
[00:53:00]  Right?  No.  Things have to be special.  They got your Carlin picture in here, which is nice.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  Very nice.  They should have had the one with Sam Kinison.  Oh, that's before the 20 years with Anthony.  Right.  I'm over 30 years.  They have the little guy.  I'm celebrating 30 years.  No.  The show's celebrating 20.  Opie and Dopey, the newspaper.  This is good, man.  Yeah, it's cool.  It's a cool poster.  Is there any of Austin here?  Yes. 
[00:53:30]  Is there really?  Yep.  Bobby Kelly, Burr, Patrice Attell, Louis C.K.?  There's Louis here.  Fallon's here.  John Cena.  Fallon.  Nice.  Guy Fieri.  Anthony on stage in some awful...  That might be...  Anthony on stage right now.  It's like a...  Obviously a collage.  And...  Right.  The Hulkster made it.  Opie and Anthony Van.  This is really cool.  Picture Sam in the corner, which makes me kind of ill.  A wow sticker.  Why is Sam on our poster? 
[00:54:00]  Big A.  Let's see.  Okay, I'm tweeting this fucking thing.  The official...  What is this called?  The official...  It's a...  Hashtag OA20 poster.  I'm not hashtagging anything.  That's the hashtag.  There's a hashtag on the poster?  No, but that's what we're doing.  The official Opie and Anthony poster.  Why can't he write hashtag OA20?  Opie and Anthony poster.  Why?  Because people are going to start using that hashtag?  That's right.  That's going to be the hashtag of unmasked. 
[00:54:30]  20 year...  Opie and Anthony.  20 years.  20 year...  How do you do this?  The official Opie and Anthony 20 year poster?  Or is it years?  Hashtag OA20.  How about the official Opie and Anthony 20 year poster?  Does that work?  No.  Let me see what it looks like.  Yeah.  I think they should have had a bigger picture of you guys on there.  You think?  Yeah.  The official Opie and Anthony 20 year poster.  There you go.  Hashtag what?  Hashtag OA20. 
[00:55:00]  But OA20 is not going to work on Instagram.  Why not?  It just won't.  Yeah, it will.  I guarantee it won't.  What do you mean won't work?  How will it not work?  I don't know.  The official Opie and Anthony 20 year poster.  Okay, I just tweeted that.  Oh, I was looking for a photo of Club Soda Kenny.  Right.  And the big zero in 20 is over his face.  Oh, really?  Very appropriate.  Yeah.  If you look, that's his photo with Gary Coleman behind the zero.  And you can see Gary Coleman's little face.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a tiny little sliver of Kenny's head. 
[00:55:30]  That counts.  Yep.  All right.  We've got to start signing those for tomorrow.  Yeah, it looks good.  I mean, it's well done.  What time are we getting there tomorrow?  Like four.  Four?  Okay.  That's when it starts, yeah.  So I get there and walk right on stage.  Nice.  Yeah.  And then we're out by, what, 5.05?  Yeah.  The room has to be sat by 5.20.  What's up, Kenny?  Did you see your picture on the poster? 
[00:56:00]  Nice poster.  Thank you.  I guess you're building to a bigger poster also.  Yeah, the poster's tiny.  Why?  They wanted to save money?  It's about...  The poster really is small, Sam.  I mean, it's not a movie-sized poster, no, but it's bigger than a sheet of paper.  You know, I think that also, they might think, like, who's going to...  What, are you going to put a giant poster on the wall, maybe?  I don't know how many fans would put a poster up, because our fans are getting older.  Yeah, they are.  They're not in their 50s, but, I mean, you know, they're 30s. 
[00:56:30]  They're not in their 50s.  Some of them are, but, I mean...  They're absolutely in their 50s.  The majority of our fans, like, when I go to shows, the majority of people are not in  their 50s, and they're all ONA fans.  Mid-30s, probably?  Yeah.  Yeah, young 30s.  I mean...  Nice.  We still have a lower demo than our own age.  Right.  I think a lot of those guys are married, and it'd be hard for them to tell their wife,  look, no, no, there's 16x45 ONA posters.  Perfect.  Here's Big A.  You're just pointing everyone out?  Yeah.  Excitedly.  Exactly. 
[00:57:00]  She's packing her suitcase.  Right.  I think the wives have had it.  They've had it.  With the ONA listener.  Yeah, and the fucking sayings, and the characters, and the jokes, and they're tired of it.  I know the fans try to get the wives involved.  It's a very small percentage.  Come on board.  Here's something I've never heard of the show.  We love the Opie and Anthony show.  Dude, my wife turned me on to it.  Right.  I've never heard those words.  It's always a girl whose husband forced her to listen, and then it kind of grew on her.  I've got to tell you, the Chip podcast is setting the podcast world on fire. 
[00:57:30]  It is doing quite well.  Wow.  I just retweeted it for Jen.  Yes.  Jennifer Carmody, she's got a podcast that started out, and it's called Carmody Central,  which is a play on her name.  And it was Chip's first real interview, and she knows Chip better than anybody.  Right.  She had to have sex with him.  She sucked Chip's dick.  She sucked Chip's dick, not yours.  No, not mine, but Chip's.  We talk about that after Chip bombed in Montreal years ago. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And it's actually a 40-minute interview, and Uncle Paul showed up, and it got really weird  at one point, because she knows them so well.  Right.  And we mentioned characters that no one has heard of yet.  They're just people that I've had in my life for years.  Right.  That have never been on the radio.  Which ones?  Lumpy, I don't talk about on the air.  I won't do them.  Lumpy.  Why would you ask that question?  I'm just discussing.  Because what else are we going to do today?  No, we're talking.  Everyone's sick around here.  So since we don't have any real guests, we have to have all Jim's characters. 
[00:58:30]  Yes, exactly.  Why not?  They're very popular, Sam.  Everyone's sick, and Rich Voss is coming in.  Why do you keep saying that like it's bad news?  This is my description of hell.  Yeah, it really is not shaping up to be a good day.  This is pretty much one of those dreams.  You see the poster?  Yeah, great.  It's tiny, and they only have 20 of them.  Great.  It's a good 8x16.  Just open it up, and whoever wants a poster, they can mail in for a poster or something,  or whatever.  I don't know.  They're limited edition. 
[00:59:00]  Fuck limited edition.  We'll photocopy this one and send us.  Right.  Fuck limited edition.  That should be available for everybody, period.  Everything should be available for everybody.  That's why it should have been a bigger venue, a longer broadcast, posters for everyone.  Can't do anything that's special.  Wait, Sam, are you saying you think 40 minutes of Chip is too much?  Yeah, I listened to some of the podcasts, and I mean, it was good, but I was like, I can't  hang with Chip.  I think I'm going to listen in parts.  You have to listen in parts. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Should we get a clip or two?  I would like to hear a clip or two.  I heard most of it.  I didn't hear all of it, but it was weird to listen to.  Great.  I'd like to hear a Chip or two.  Great news.  Rich is going to be here in 15 minutes.  Excellent.  Why are you sighing after that?  Here's the thing.  What?  What's the thing?  It's going to be a great show.  Voss is going to be in.  We're going to get some clips from the Chip podcast.  Right.  We're going to be signing posters. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  I mean, we've got a lot on the plate right now.  Are people going to eventually start answering the phone calls that have been ringing for  a half hour?  That's not happening.  Not today, huh?  No.  Who's in there?  We got anybody screening calls or not today?  Sal, we have intern Adrian on the phone today.  She's a delight.  He's a boy.  Adrian is a boy.  Sorry, Adrian.  She really likes taking her time because not one phone call is ready for broadcast.  Not a one.  He did them all properly in here. 
[01:00:30]  Well, that goes back to the other issue we had today.  The phone system wasn't working either.  Phones weren't working.  They're working for the pre-show.  Way to embarrass up in front of the entire listening audience.  No, no, no.  I think it's a technical thing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  You're supposed to agree and go, yeah, you're right, boss, and then talk to him up here.  You could just take him cold.  I don't care, but, yeah.  Yeah, it's probably just compliments for us anyway.  We'll do an hour of compliments.  Yeah.  Mars, our phones aren't working. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Mars was too busy.  It was fucking his big debut in Anthony's chair.  You should have seen Mars.  It was all happy standing up there.  He wanted to sit in that chair.  He positioned it behind him.  So if the discussion got longer, he could put his ass back on the chair, but he just  knew better not to.  Good news.  E-Rock's walking down the hall looking busy.  He was looking at his phone like he's got something for the show.  Welcome aboard, Alex Morris.  And now he's shaking his head.  That means no, he doesn't.  And now he's walking by the studio.  Oh, he's going to go in there and make himself useful. 
[01:01:30]  That's not working from this room?  Yes.  Well.  Yes.  Let's see.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  I don't know who you are.  I don't know what you want to talk about.  I don't know where you're from.  What's your name?  Let's start there.  What?  Hi, guys.  I'm Laura.  Hi, Laura.  How are you?  I'm good.  Good.  Been a fan since you've been as Elfus.  Since you guys took over N.E.W. and shocked the shit out of me.  So I've been listening to you guys forever and ever and ever.  Jimmy, I've seen you forever. 
[01:02:00]  Been a couple of your shows.  Thank you.  And I'm out of your demo.  I'm 57.  Wow.  And my husband hates you.  Wow.  What does he listen to?  I don't even know.  He doesn't, you know, I don't know.  Why does he hate us?  He doesn't hate you.  He just doesn't understand your humor.  He doesn't understand why I like you.  I like to hear that once in a while, though.  It's about time.  This is very rare, I think.  That's right.  So if you ever need me for some, you know, old people stuff, let me know.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay. 
[01:02:30]  Love you.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  Hi.  Who's this?  I don't know what you're talking about or where you're from, so introduce yourself.  Whenever you say, hi, who's this?  My fucking limbs just freeze.  I only want to say, hi, who is this for certain people.  But we have to do it today because I don't know who's on the phone.  Who's this?  Hello?  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  No, I'm Pete from Northern Maine.  Hi, Pete.  Northern Maine.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I was just driving to work today with my wife, and she made me change the station. 
[01:03:00]  She said she'd take a listen to Hopi and Anthony.  Thanks.  Well, sir.  What does she want to listen to?  I don't know.  Probably country music or something stupid.  Not very appropriate, at least the first part of that.  Right.  All right.  But, yeah, congratulations on 30 years.  Hopi and 20 years for LNA.  Might be a little more than 30.  I did start as a teenager.  That is true.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Didn't you only have a show for three years before Ant Camel? 
[01:03:30]  How long were you doing?  Hannah.  Oh, I thought it was only three years.  I did over 10 years.  Before Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I realized that.  And then you could maybe throw a little college radio in there as well.  Or is that?  Wait, college radio is five.  Five years of college radio.  And then another six, I think.  Six years by myself.  Sam, everybody wants posters. 
[01:04:00]  I don't think that nobody wants them.  There are people that are listening all over the world that want posters.  I don't feel like holding back posters to make it this weird limited edition thing.  But in the end, that doesn't matter to anybody.  The people who get them, it matters to them.  If they're fans, they're fans.  But it can be special.  It's not as special.  I mean, for the people that are broadcasting, they're listening across the country, we're  broadcasting it.  So everybody's going to be able to be a part of it. 
[01:04:30]  How did the rest of the people get their posters?  I need to know right now.  We're only doing these posters.  No, I'm not doing that.  We're not making 10,000 posters.  Let's make Don Wicklund work for once, for real.  This is like real work.  How does everyone else get posters?  As of right now, posters will be given to those who are able to attend the event at Caroline's.  No.  Are you telling me that's unacceptable?  Yeah, your name's not on the wall. 
[01:05:00]  That's true.  I'm making it official.  If you want a poster, we're going to figure it out.  Oh, Jesus.  And we're going to be stuffing envelopes for a very long time.  Well, no, you said we.  That's the wrong pronoun.  We as, you know, a show.  Yeah, yeah.  You won't be coming near and ever.  No, of course not.  You won't even be licking one.  But I came up with a great idea that everyone should get a poster.  What do you mean you came up with that idea?  I kind of did.  Yes, Mars?  Hey, I just noticed something about the poster.  Great poster, by the way.  You're not on it.  None of the staff are on it, except...  Believe me, I noticed that, too. 
[01:05:30]  Except for who?  Sam.  I had nothing to do with the design of the poster.  Let me see the poster.  Mars should be on here.  Yeah, I mean, I don't...  The staff probably should have been on here.  E-Rock at least should have been on there.  As much as we beat the shit out of these guys, they are the best staff we've had.  Yeah, E-Rock should have been on there, without a doubt.  Yeah.  No offense to Sal, but E-Rock's been there for a long time.  Mars, too.  I mean, I don't know about Mars.  There's not...  Fuck you, Sam.  Anything remarkable, but E-Rock should have definitely been on the poster.  Yeah, and... 
[01:06:00]  I mean, I hate to leave Travis on.  No, I don't.  Instead of having...  Instead of having E-Rock, they had to have a picture of me showing a almost bicept.  Hey!  Let's redo the poster.  We're not...  No, the poster...  Yeah, we want them redone by tomorrow.  We've got to redo the poster and get E-Rock on there.  I want 10,000 of them.  And Mars could be under the 20, so we could say, look, you were on the poster, but the 20  had to take over that part.  That sounds good.  All right?  I think maybe E-Rock should have been on it, and Kenny probably should have been a little  more prominent.  Kenny's right ear is on the poster.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  I would have liked a little more Kenny, but...  And Gary Coleman's head. 
[01:06:30]  But beyond that, it's a beautiful poster.  The people in focus are Opie, Anthony, and Jim, and those are the ones that matter.  And the people who go to Caroline's are going to get quite a lovely treat.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, let's redo this poster.  We're not...  It's tomorrow.  And whoever wants a poster could have one.  How do they do that?  They don't.  Do you want to start a mailing address or something?  Do I?  No, of course not.  Should they tweet you?  No, they shouldn't.  If you want your free poster, tweet Not Sam, and he'll take care of it.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  But you have to use some kind of harsh language when you tweet him.  Don't ask for one.  Say, give me a poster, and then put whatever description of Sam you'd like to after.  Exactly.  Half of something.  Cocksucking something.  That's right.  I don't think they need any help.  I think they got it.  You think they understood?  Yeah.  Over-explaining?  Yeah.  Let me say hi to this guy.  He makes a very, very, very good point.  I don't know who you are, sir, but go ahead.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I just wanted to agree with you to tell Sam how wrong he is, because, you know, these are 
[01:07:30]  posters.  They're not Cronut.  Yeah.  They're not Cronut.  We're not the Cronut guy, where we make 14 a day.  Whoever wants a poster should get a poster.  The poster is to commemorate the event.  That's like, I mean, every band, every concert you go to now has a special edition poster for  the specific concert.  We don't do things that way.  If a fan wants a poster, he should get a poster.  Well, why don't I have Don Wicklund work on a special poster that we can mass produce,  and this will be the one that is exclusive to Caroline. 
[01:08:00]  Well, Bill on Twitter, I don't know how to say his last name, Leheka, says, why not make  it 300 signed limited edition posters and allow an unlimited run of unsigned posters?  That might be the difference.  I'm signing every poster for every fan that wants one.  We can have some that are unsigned that just get sent out.  You guys are overthinking this stuff.  Yeah.  Limited edition stuff sucks a dick.  No, it doesn't.  It does.  Jim, you like limited edition stuff.  I do, especially if I have a copy of it.  That's the point.  I hate limited edition stuff that I don't have a copy of. 
[01:08:30]  But you're going to have your posters somewhere, and you're not even going to know how many  other posters were given out in the end.  Well, make believe we only gave out a couple hundred, but let everyone have a poster.  You don't make believe anything.  The guys get posters.  Guess what, Sam?  What?  I will talk about posters for three more hours until you get on the phone with Don and figure  out how we're going to make this happen.  The reason you'll talk about posters for the next three hours is because everybody is sick  and Rich Voss is coming in. 
[01:09:00]  Jesus, you reminded me of that.  I was kind of trying to forget that for a moment.  What do you think, Kenny?  Should everyone get a poster?  Of course, G.H.  Sorry that only your right eye is on the poster.  I apologize for that.  Right ear?  Is this the right eye?  I mean, right ear.  The eye didn't make it.  Right ear.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You see it?  Yeah, make more posters, Timber.  We're going to make more posters.  Yeah.  All right?  Why don't we make a new poster?  Who picked the urine color? 
[01:09:30]  I think that the colors of the show are yellow and black.  Yeah.  But the pictures, it's a weird urine colored poster.  It's a sepia tint.  I don't like the poster at all.  Let's start over.  Look, this is going to be the poster for Caroline's.  For the big unmasked that's tomorrow at 4 p.m. Eastern here on the channel.  What channel?  The Opie and Anthony channel.  It's going to be...  Really?  It's going to be live.  Oh, wow.  You didn't know.  It's on Raw Dog also.  Really?  Yeah, but if they're listening to this channel already, they don't need to turn it to Raw Dog. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  They'll sound better here.  Yeah, but they can tell their friends who don't have the Opie and Anthony channel,  hey, you listen to Raw Dog, that's how we cross-promote.  True.  That's why we're doing it.  We don't believe in promoting off the platform, only on the platform.  Anthony's out sick.  Maybe there's not going to be an unmasked.  I've already talked to him.  I mean, he's resting up today so he can be there tomorrow.  It's one of those one-day sicknesses.  He'll be here tomorrow.  Anthony will make sure he comes in tomorrow, of course.  Let's say hi to Greg in Texas.  Greg.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:10:30]  What's up?  I got the solution to the poster problem.  We all have printers.  Just put it on your webpage.  We'll print our own.  That's a great idea.  High res, right?  Let's do a high res.  I think we should make a special 20th anniversary poster for everybody, and this one will just  be for the unmanaged.  No, our listeners love free shit.  Everybody loves free shit.  There's no denying that.  I'm in the business of selling some shit, but I also understand free shit.  There's nothing to understand about free shit.  I'll put this on my website, and everyone can download it, because they should be able 
[01:11:00]  to get a poster for free, of course.  I'm not going to sell them.  We can copy it and put it on our desktop.  But I think everyone wants a little autograph, too, so they're all going to get one.  Call Don right now and work this out.  Tell them what we need.  On the air?  Yeah, that's fine.  I don't know if I would have made the...  I like the 20 in big, bright yellow.  I don't know if I would have yellow-tinted it.  Just find the poster and put it on the webpage, and I can download it with your signature. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, but that's not as good as getting the actual signature.  Right, exactly, sir.  You don't actually get a little bit of skin flex.  And it doesn't create a whole bunch of extra work for people.  Sorry, fellas.  Who cares?  We've got to sign all of them.  That's right.  I don't care.  We're signing as many posters as the listeners want, and you fuckers are mailing them out.  We don't have that many posters.  We'll print more.  That's right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All you guys got to do is the fucking print work.  Oh, Rich.  Try being the celebrity.  Rich is here. 
[01:12:00]  As soon as he walks away, he's going to break.  As soon as he comes in.  Hi, Rich.  What's this?  It's our poster.  Oh, it was a bookie just pointing at it.  That's our poster, celebrating 20 years for our unmasked tomorrow.  Jesus.  What's wrong with it?  I love it.  See, it's nice.  You think it should be a limited edition, or should fans be able to, you know, get them?  Oh, I got a picture on that.  Yes, you're a part of the poster. 
[01:12:30]  Look at that.  He's been listening.  He posed a question.  He was too busy seeing if he had a picture on the poster.  He did the same thing every one of us did.  How much of me is on the poster?  He said twice.  Look at that.  Jimmy's face.  Before and after.  Fat and skinny.  I like that.  Is there fat and skinny?  No.  No, it's only fat and skinny.  So, what about the poster, Sam?  What about it?  One's Rich just threw on the floor? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, they're getting a little...  You might want to take them out of the studio before we sign them.  Yeah, good idea.  If you stick them on the side of your car window, well, girls, I fill in the punchline.  Remember what I said a few minutes ago.  Sam, give me that.  The poster?  I like them.  And the quality.  It's good quality.  It's poster paper.  It's not poster paper.  What's wrong with it?  This is magazine quality.  No, it's poster quality. 
[01:13:30]  What do you think, Martin?  Sam, you're such a fucking company guy nowadays, bro.  You don't think so?  This is not even close to poster quality.  Magazine page, Martin?  Yeah.  It's slightly better than a magazine page.  Slightly.  Nice thickness to it.  It's like the cover of the magazine.  I like it.  Okay, that's not...  Plus, since it's limited edition, you slide it into a frame to keep it nice?  We're not doing limited edition.  What?  God damn it.  Do I have to do this myself?  It's going to depress the hell out of this guy, but fuck it. 
[01:14:00]  Remember when we did the Patrice roast and we had that nice limited edition poster?  It wasn't a roast.  I mean...  It was dead.  It was a tribute.  It was a beautiful poster that everyone should have got.  And we stood there and just criticized him when he was dead, that one?  Don's not answering today.  He's on the choo-choo, I think.  He's probably trying to figure out how he can make this available for all listeners.  Well, yeah, because you've demanded it.  Yeah.  And we'll tell you tomorrow how you can get your poster. 
[01:14:30]  No.  Yes, I'm telling you.  Why can't this just be a thing to promote Unmasked and be like, oh, wow, Unmasked is going to be great?  I'll say it again.  Because in the end, it doesn't matter if it's a limited edition.  Someone says...  If a fan wants that, he should be able to get that.  A limited edition is if you go to a Jim Norton show and you get a picture with him.  That's limited edition.  Absolutely.  But every band...  Because only the eight people that bought tickets can have one.  Is this the 20 years now? 
[01:15:00]  Does this count the years you weren't working or 20 years?  No, we're going to redo this whole thing two years from now.  Yeah, exactly.  This is the 17 and a half year anniversary.  It really is the 17 and a half anniversary.  You're right, Rich.  We haven't done radio for 20 years.  We met 20 years ago.  Yes.  20 years ago, there was a handshake.  Right.  Hi.  Every band does limited edition posters for their gigs now.  We're a dopey radio show.  We're not a band.  You guys need to pick next level.  I know our fans, and I know they're going to want the poster, and they should be able 
[01:15:30]  to get the poster.  You guys are not thinking next level.  Fans are lashing out at Sam.  They say, why is Sam pushing people out of recognition?  Between no E-Rock on the poster and no Jim Norton in the opener, he's gunning for himself.  I'm not in the opener either.  I know that.  I just said E-Rock should be on the poster.  Oh, that means you feel like you should be in the opener.  He did say that.  Or you wouldn't have brought that up.  No, he just wants to tear other people down.  He says, I'm not in the open either.  I understand.  That means he has thought about this.  I added Jim to the intro. 
[01:16:00]  Dramatically, by the way.  That's true.  The whole intro has to stop to get Jim Norton's name in it.  After you remove me on purpose.  Even the higher ups went, I don't know if he should be.  Yeah, let's just see.  I didn't think I'd notice.  I'm supportive of Jim Norton being on the radio program.  Oh, yeah.  For the record.  Okay.  And yeah, this guy makes a great point.  We're a national show now.  We're an international show, technically.  We got little small pockets of listeners in every country in the world almost.  True.  And in Canada.  And this guy says it. 
[01:16:30]  Why is everything special for the New York listeners when most listeners aren't in New York?  Well, we're building to something bigger.  Yes.  Drive to Philly.  You guys are big.  I was in Canada last year.  Vancouver.  You guys are fucking big in Vancouver.  All right.  So guys in Vancouver should be able to get the poster.  But what if we do...  And they will get the poster.  What if we do...  I will have it my way.  You know that, Sam.  Of course you will.  And you guys are going to be very mad when you spend the next month getting these out.  Yeah.  How can you say limited edition?  This box alone makes it more than a limited edition.  Well, that's just enough for the fans that show up. 
[01:17:00]  There's like three-something, which is enough for the people that will show up with them.  Yeah, that's the number.  That's one box.  That's the limited edition number.  We have no O&A stuff really out there, so this would be cool for people.  What if we do like...  We'll sign them all and then we'll mail them out to people.  But what if we do a Canada gig later this year and then we have posters for that?  What if we have posters for every gig and eventually...  Are we doing the comedy festival up there in Montreal this year?  Am I?  Are you guys...  No?  We're working on it.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:17:30]  What's the...  It's not a no.  Sam, what do you know?  I know that they're...  We're working on it.  There's budget concerns?  That's exactly correct.  There's budget concerns?  I thought we were going to do the Montreal Comedy Festival every year.  We're figuring out where the funding is coming from right now.  Sell posters.  I just went to the...  Rich.  I just went to the town hall yesterday.  Yeah?  Downstairs with Jim Meyer, who's the CEO here.  How was it?  Yeah.  He said there's 30 million subscribers, so we need 30 million posters. 
[01:18:00]  We're not getting that many.  I took notes, right?  That's unrealistic.  I'm kidding.  I took notes.  Oh, wow.  Jeez.  I'm trying to be a little bit more of a company guy.  All right.  It's all about innovation and content and execution.  Really?  We have to do our jobs well.  Company worth...  Company worth 22...  What?  Company is worth 22...  Billion dollars.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:18:30]  What do you mean, where is the money coming from?  Well, let's budget it up.  We have unbeatable content.  Strong business model.  Long-term growth is...  Wow.  Really?  Impressive.  And here's the thing.  40 million dollar upgrades on the 36th floor.  What floor are we on?  36th.  So they're going to spend 40 million dollars on this floor alone.  And they can't find money for the Montreal Comedy Festival for us?  That was a huge success last year?  But how great does the lobby look, though, right?  Why is Tim and Don involved with this channel if they can't get these little things done? 
[01:19:00]  We're working on it.  We haven't...  What do you mean working on it?  It's a no-brainer.  We did it last year.  It was successful.  We should be doing it again.  We'd like to do it.  We just have to figure out where the funding is coming from.  But that's not to say we're not going to get the funding.  Why are you wearing a little boy shirt?  It's a sweatshirt.  I kind of like the vibe of this show.  It's nice.  It's going to be a weird day.  Yeah.  What do you mean they're trying to get the funding?  No, they're not trying.  They're figuring out where it's coming from. 
[01:19:30]  And finally, this is where I learned from the town hall.  Honesty.  Hard work.  Creativity.  Diversity.  Teamwork.  We'll get you nowhere.  All sounded nice yesterday.  And then we come in here today and they can't figure out  how to get us to Montreal.  How about this?  I'll drive myself.  I don't give a fuck.  And I'll get my own hotel room.  Because that's a good gig.  We're getting the funding together.  We're just figuring out where it's coming from.  Kenny is a doom and gloom type of guy. 
[01:20:00]  No, Kenny's a no bullshit type of guy.  No, he's a negative guy.  Not a corporate douche like someone in this room.  Who are you talking about?  Mars?  You.  Oh.  Thank you.  I will remain positive, GH.  Thank you.  As of now, there's no money.  You've been told that?  No.  Nobody's told you that directly.  There's a big meeting next week.  Enough with the meeting.  We did it last year.  We're doing it this year.  How much money could it fucking possibly cost  to send you to Montreal? 
[01:20:30]  We go private.  Why are you still rubbing your tattoos with that shit?  I should have a new one.  Yeah.  Oh, you did get another new one?  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's see.  It's a dunce hat.  I can't see, Rich.  Okay.  It's a little boat.  Huh?  What is it?  The fucking Amistad tattooed on your fucking form?  What is it?  Well, I'll be working in a month.  What is it, really?  Let me see.  It's a ship.  Why do you have a ship on your arm?  I love that.  The guy at Immortal Ink that does my tattoos at Immortal Ink, 
[01:21:00]  I just need something to fill in right here.  Why don't you just pick a ship?  They got misunderstood.  Because someone said the boss was a big guy.  I forgot.  Slowed out.  I dropped out.  I didn't know where I was going.  I was trying to call you a piece of shit and couldn't get it out.  Yeah.  I had a shit ship joke in there somewhere.  I was trying to word.  Yeah.  I mean, how much could it cost?  I have a proposition for you.  What?  No.  You'll like this.  No.  This guy coming tomorrow to see your unmasked. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  My golfer friend from North Carolina, Roy.  Right.  Holy shit.  He rocks eating an apple.  Listen to this.  Holy fuck.  He rocks eating an apple.  No, no.  Someone's about to roast him.  Does he do that on purpose?  Walk by with healthy choices?  I'm sure.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead, Rich.  Sorry.  He paid for a foursome at this big golf tournament that Michael Jordan's there and stuff in North 
[01:22:00]  Carolina.  Right.  I can look it up.  But he'll pay.  You could play in this tournament in North Carolina a couple days.  Me and you paid for if you want to go.  Let's do it.  I'm serious.  I mean, I don't know.  Let's get the team back together.  What's that?  Let's get the golf team back together.  Are you going to be making my lunch?  You know, unscathed.  He's right.  We had problems when we golfed together.  But I'm telling you, he's coming tomorrow. 
[01:22:30]  His name's Roy.  We actually played the blue monster at Doral, which is a big fucking course that Trump just  took over.  And I broke my hand and he had a tooth that had to be pulled.  On vacation.  And that was also the vacation where I had to wake him up in the middle of the night  because he would, I don't know, why were we sharing a room?  Because you were up here.  I was doing very well back then.  Why did we share a room?  I know.  We had like.  I'd have the answer if you guys really wanted to.  I forgot. 
[01:23:00]  We shared a room with twin beds.  And I look over to Rich Voss.  I look over at Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Rich.  And he fell asleep with a cigarette that was all the way, one of those cigarettes where  it's burnt all the way down and with a huge ash that's ready to fall on the rug.  Like a grandmother's ash.  And I had to wake you up to put your cigarette out.  I guess I fell asleep listening to his sob stories about his family. 
[01:23:30]  I do go deep when we're together, don't I?  Well, anyhow, we're invited to play in this golf tournament.  That'll be good.  I mean, this is a major.  Every athlete's there.  Jordan.  Mark Lee.  Right.  So.  Sam, by the way, breaking news.  Yes.  I love that you have absolutely no heat here.  Why?  You were insisting on the poster thing being a limited edition, right?  Yes.  Breaking news.  I will figure out a way to let the fans get a copy of the poster. 
[01:24:00]  Signed.  E-Rock.  Don Wicklund.  But couldn't any fan.  So there you go.  Everyone will get a poster.  Who wants one?  For free.  Couldn't a fan take this poster and have him run off?  Yeah, sure.  No, I think they want us to sign him, though.  So we're going to sign him.  It'll take a while because we're going to have to sign here and there.  But we'll get him out to the people.  What the hell?  All right?  We could put a cap on it or something.  That would make it a limited edition.  Yeah, but a better limited edition. 
[01:24:30]  Like, what's the cap?  Like, you know, you got the whole month of May to ask if you want one.  Oh.  Something like that.  So it's not limited edition.  There's just a time limit.  Yeah.  I see.  Yeah.  They're calling you a limited edition cunt, by the way, Sam.  That doesn't even make any sense.  It does.  It doesn't make sense.  It makes a lot of sense.  I don't know what that means, but I disagree with at least half of it.  I don't agree with limited edition things.  I don't agree with building towards something bigger.  I like collectibles and I like promotions. 
[01:25:00]  I like both of those things, too.  You saved that shirt from sixth grade?  Isn't SiriusXM already up at the comedy festival?  Montreal Comedy Festival?  Meaning they're going?  Yes.  All right.  So we just got to get ourselves there.  I'll drive.  I like that drive.  I left that week open.  Let's drive.  I'll drive to Montreal.  There's nothing that says we're not going to Montreal.  And then we'll cut down the staff.  You see Anthony driving up there? 
[01:25:30]  I don't see Ant wanting to take a...  No?  No.  No.  No, I don't see Ant wanting to do that.  I wouldn't want to do it either.  All you have to do is put a palmist string and a 14-hole in front of his car.  That was very good.  Will you guys fly coach?  I don't care.  Yes.  It's an hour flight.  Jim's looking at me.  They don't even have first class going to Montreal.  They do in Air Canada.  It's an hour flight.  It's the worst airline. 
[01:26:00]  They can go fuck themselves.  Fair enough.  But I'm just answering Sam's question.  Absolutely not.  No.  When you want to go to the comedy festival...  There's not that much more.  We want an animation festival before our contract ends to say goodbye to everybody.  And whatever that...  Why would they throw...  And whatever that big event is that we're building toward.  Yeah.  Why would they...  Do you know anything about this building toward thing?  I mean, I know about the big event they want to do.  What is it?  I'm not going to say...  I don't need surprises either in my life.  Yeah, what is it?  I'm too old for surprises.  What is it?  Well, I'm not going to know because I'm not going to announce it now.  Jim comes out of the closet. 
[01:26:30]  Who would be surprised?  I'd just run out and fucking two people would go, oh yeah, we thought so.  Yeah.  Anyway.  But why would they throw you a big event and spend a bunch of money on it if you just  said it's to say goodbye to everybody?  It's a fucking farewell.  Thanks for your service.  Right.  It's about time we get a nice send-off.  Exactly.  And then we'll move on to whatever's next for everybody.  Have you ever gotten a nice send-off from anywhere that you want?  No.  That's why I'm expecting a nice send-off. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  It's a thanks for making this shithole bearable for a few years.  See, everyone's saying on my Instagram they want the poster.  You can check out the poster on my Instagram, which is opi-radio.  I have no problem with people getting posters or even producing another poster.  It's done.  We can move on.  I was such a pain in the ass that I got it done.  That's what I do.  Yeah, I know.  I wasted a half hour of radio to talk about posters until Don finally said, all right!  He's wasted ten years of radio.  I'm well aware of this strategy. 
[01:27:30]  I don't like surprises.  We don't know.  Because if I'm not involved with the thing, it's going to be douchey.  We don't know.  And you're not going to like it when you do it because you have no hand in it.  How about the cupcakes thing?  That was supposed to be a surprise.  Thank God I found out.  And I said no to the cupcakes.  I am your rep.  They wanted celebrities to walk out during our unmasked with cupcakes.  Look at Rich's face.  And he's stupid.  And he's stupid.  I'm far from stupid.  I have a 141 IQ.  You are far from stupid, but not in the direction you think.  Can we do an online IQ test? 
[01:28:00]  You know what Punchline was coming because his eyes opened up.  Can we do an online IQ test with you today?  Not today, but I'll do it.  I just did one.  What do you mean not today?  Because it takes too long and I'm tired.  What else are we going to do?  Huh?  Have the place to sit.  Jimmy's under the weather, too.  He doesn't feel good.  It's easy.  I'll do it.  I'll knock that out of the box.  Will you shut up?  That means you're not going to get close to a 140.  I guarantee I beat you.  Whoa!  Look, let me say this gently. 
[01:28:30]  That's not exactly something to brag about.  I'm going to say that in the spirit I meant.  What's the big event?  We don't know exactly what the big event is, but it will involve a much bigger venue and  guests used organically.  Oh, God.  They're trying to throw a roast together.  Jesus.  But I'm going to tell you something.  They're going to do a roast.  I'm your representative.  You don't have to worry about douchey things. 
[01:29:00]  You were on board with the cupcakes?  Absolutely not.  I was out the day they suggested it, and I got back, and the first time I heard about  the cupcakes was on the air.  Oh, that's true.  You're right about that.  I would have said that was a terrible idea.  By the way, I made my poster picture purposely blurry so they couldn't steal it.  Smart.  But you just said you wanted everybody to have it.  I want them to have the original with the autograph.  Here's one that's stolen.  Right.  I don't want a bad bootleg out there.  Why can't we make a different poster for everybody?  Huh?  Why can't we make a different poster for everybody? 
[01:29:30]  There's one photo I'd like to swap out on there.  Which one?  One in the bottom right corner.  It's my photo.  Oh.  What are you doing in your photo?  I think I'm putting my hand over a box that is on Bobo's head.  Oh, right.  That was a great day.  It was a great day.  We just had Bobo in a box all day.  That's right.  And they never made the radio.  No.  Which is strange.  Just a little something for us.  You all right?  Yeah, I was just stretching, but I'm sore from yesterday.  No lube? 
[01:30:00]  No lube.  Jesus.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Get something done today.  Thanks for tuning in.  Rich is going to be where?  Oh, I got just a string of Thursday night Bridge Street live in Connecticut.  Friday, Smitty's in Maine, in Sanford, Maine.  And then Saturday at Millie's Tavern in Manchester, New Hampshire.  How do you get to all those places?  Because this one I'm driving. 
[01:30:30]  You're going to drive all the way to Maine?  Then New Hampshire.  Well, you know what's worse?  But New Hampshire's on the way back, kind of.  I kind of, I...  Well, it is on the way back.  I just flew home from Vancouver.  Right.  I'm doing this, and I get home Sunday, and I fly to Vegas Monday to the MGM Grand.  Right.  It's like, it's...  What are you doing at the MGM Grand?  I'm working the comedy club there, Brad Garrett's Comedy Room.  Oh, yeah.  We used to go there a lot when they used to, like, you know, let us travel.  So, this Thursday through... 
[01:31:00]  Well, how was Vancouver?  It was kind of cool.  It was...  The world was great.  I had something booked.  I had some kind of scheduling thing, and I had to cancel it, but I hear it's a really cool city.  I want to go to that city badly.  It's a really cool, like you can see...  I mean, I couldn't play golf because of my stupid pulled muscle.  No, one cares.  Yeah, I'm throwing...  Exactly.  No, one cares.  But I'm telling you what it was, so I'm saying...  Because I would have went...  Wait, what were you saying?  They say the course is on the ocean and the mountain.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, I forgot.  It's just wacky radio time.  I don't care. 
[01:31:30]  For God.  Limited time.  Did you wander around Vancouver, though?  Yeah, we went...  Yeah, I went over to something island or whatever.  Right.  It was kind of cool.  I hear it's a great city.  The audiences were great.  It's just a great...  It was a great club.  Did you draw in Vancouver?  Yeah, it was pretty good.  It wasn't bad.  I didn't even do any radio up there, and I didn't do you guys last week, so it was pretty good.  I was surprised at how many O&A people were there, for real.  I was really surprised.  Nice.  And those people want posters, too, and they're going to get posters. 
[01:32:00]  I got a lot of tweets.  Yes, you did.  A lot.  You can thank me for the new followers, too, you son of a bitch.  Thank you.  All right.  Don says he's making wallet-sized posters for everybody.  What?  That's nice.  Putting your wallet, show a friend a card.  That's what Don just texted me.  Business cards.  He said, I'm going to make wallet-sized posters for everybody.  Yes.  That's hilarious, Don.  You're not going to accept that one?  Really funny.  No, that's supposed to be a joke.  Oh.  Because if it's wallet-sized, you won't be able to see any of these pictures.  Oh.  They'll be really tiny. 
[01:32:30]  No, they're going to get the full poster.  And maybe we could get, like, poster paper.  I mean, it's not the thickest poster ever.  It's flimsy.  Just like this show.  But it's good for a poster.  Put it in a nice frame, limited edition.  Stop explaining what to do with the poster.  We know.  Right.  Here's the golf tournament.  It's called the...  Oh, my God.  We could talk about that off air.  Exactly.  Stop it.  Stop it.  You can't get in trouble for payola.  You're just bragging.  It's not payola.  I'm trying to get...  You like these sneakers I bought? 
[01:33:00]  Let me see.  What sneakers did you get?  I don't know, but I'd love to...  No, I don't, actually.  Really?  No, I don't.  That's great.  What, are you going to a dance in 1950?  That was terrible.  What sneakers did you get?  They're fucking terrible.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  They're bowling shoes.  They're bowling.  They're awful.  No, they're fucking...  I can't wait to wear them.  What's the name?  I don't...  eBay.  They're awful.  Those are old fucking...  1950s, like, bopper shoes.  Yeah.  Black and white.  They're terrible.  Oh, you're crazy.  No, I'm not crazy.  I bought sneakers, too, yesterday.  My most expensive pair ever. 
[01:33:30]  Really?  Almost $600.  How much?  You didn't spend $600 on sneakers.  I'll be wearing...  I'll wear them tomorrow.  Are they air...  Are they retros?  I'm going to break them out for the unmasked.  Ooh.  So, notice the sneakers.  You spent $600 on sneakers for a radio show?  I swear to God, I didn't realize.  I walked into a store yesterday.  I needed a shirt for the unmasked.  And then I saw these sneakers.  I went, wow, I want those.  Tried them on.  I loved them.  I was stupid.  I didn't look at any prices yesterday. 
[01:34:00]  Where'd you get in that, Louis Vuitton?  Yeah.  Where are $600 sneakers from?  I want to know where.  I'm not saying, because then everyone else will buy them.  Nobody can afford them.  What solicitors are going to...  It's a good thing you didn't wait until we're on break to do that.  So, I thought you guys were on break already.  I don't look at price...  I don't shop for myself often, but when I do, I don't look at prices.  We can see that.  I know.  Sadly, you're right.  You're doing pretty well.  How much weight did you lose?  I noticed.  Yeah.  It's about time someone notices my weight loss instead of just jimmies. 
[01:34:30]  I see you every day.  People don't see me for a week.  I've been working my ass off.  Yeah, but you always look good.  I was getting a little mushy.  It doesn't always look good.  It was a fucking mess.  I'm joking.  Oh.  I felt like I was starting to look fat for the first time in my life.  I've lost about seven so far.  That's it.  Seven pounds?  Yeah.  Why?  It looks like more?  No, you just...  You look healthy.  You're...  Where's the joke?  None.  None on this one.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We're going to break.  Let's kiss.  I lost weight, too.  Hmm?  And you haven't gained or lost a pound since I've known you. 
[01:35:00]  Fifteen years.  Exactly.  It's...  No, I'm trying to lose five pounds.  No one cares.  I know.  I'm trying.  Really?  How about you fucking put up...  Don't get too mean.  Is it break time?  Is it?  Yeah, I just want to plug Caroline to myself next week.  We get the Unmasked tomorrow night, which we're shitting on, but it will be a lot of  fun.  And I'm happy that the show is doing it.  We're not shitting on it?  No, I mean, we're kidding.  Goofy around.  I'm the only way, but it's going to be great.  Goofy around it.  But I mean, it will be a lot of fun.  We're all going to camp out at the Carolines next week. 
[01:35:30]  You start what day?  I start Thursday through Sunday.  Yeah, we're going to camp out.  I'll go to a bunch of those shows.  Kind of like you came to see me in Philadelphia.  What happened?  I couldn't get away.  Oh.  I wanted to.  I was plugging something.  You stopped talking.  Once I hear someone, you stop talking.  I paused to breathe.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'm talking out of a loop like a fucking...  Have you never had an interaction with another living creature before?  Oh, you paused. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, I know.  It's a semicolon.  It's just, you know...  Just chatting and being conversational.  But you paused for more than three seconds.  He jumps in.  Is there tickets available still?  Yeah, of course there are.  And if you want to hear chips...  No, it can't be a lot.  I don't know, actually.  I haven't gotten ticket counts, but I'm hoping it's presentable.  212...  757-4100.  Right.  Go get your tickets for Carolines for next week with Jim Norton.  And yeah, the podcast is going to do very well this week.  Chip's first interview.  There's two podcasts, but promote yours first.  Well, this is for Jen Carmody. 
[01:36:30]  She did Chip's first real interview.  She knows Chip out of anybody.  It's a 40-minute interview with Stupid Chip and Uncle Paul, and it's on Carmody Central.  And of course, the Otto podcast for us, I think, right?  Is it Otto on this one or no?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he, Rock, put together a good one?  Yeah, it's great.  It's got...  Did we get the Unmasked thing done?  Yeah, it's got the Unmasked.  Hold on, hold on.  I want to thank Ron Bennington personally for letting us do that.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Because he did a great Unmasked with Otto, so you get to know about him and his career  and his life. 
[01:37:00]  And then what else did you put on there?  It's got the Unmasked.  It's got his last appearance here.  Which was kind of creepy.  Some of the stuff he said on that last appearance.  Yeah.  Wow.  Listen for yourself.  And what else?  And then it's got a whole bunch of moments sprinkled in.  Yeah.  It's over two hours long.  Oh, nice.  We rarely go over two hours.  And is the live read on there?  Yes.  That's the...  The Nugget?  Nugget.  Oh, good, man.  Yeah.  That's going to be a really good podcast.  Go get that.  The Hoping and Anthony podcast featuring Otto, who is no longer with us. 
[01:37:30]  I want to talk to you about that after the break.  You've known him forever.  All right?  Yeah.  He's nodded.  Yeah.  Wow, he's emotional.  It's so weird to see you emotional.  I have no emotion left in me.  No, he really doesn't.  He doesn't.  He's autism with a capital.  O&A will be right back on Sirius XM.

[01:46:00]  It was my first day in the boat.  I just bought it.  But it's this big fucking boat with two engines, and it's really complicated to drive.  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it.  We went out to the Statue of Liberty, and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing, and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like, you know, like a big round raft.  That's what it looked like to me.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed.  And Chris goes, get the fuck away from that thing. 
[01:46:30]  Like it was creepy.  So I backed away from it, and I put a light on it, and it was like, it looked like a giant  manhole cover sticking out of the river.  This was the weirdest night fucking ever.  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty.  It's like, I don't know, 20 feet across, and it's moving.  It's leaving a wake.  So I call up, and then this woman came on and says, New York Harbor Coast Guard, give  me your phone number.  So I give her my number, and this guy calls.  He goes, describe it as well as you can.  I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine, and 
[01:47:00]  it's headed towards Lower Manhattan.  That's what I'm seeing, and I'm sure it's not that, but my main concern is it's not lit,  and it could cream anything that hits that's going down.  And the guy goes, all right, well, I'll call the boat and send them to you.  So he hangs up, and like 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  So anyway, I call back, and they're not sending anybody, and at one point I got crazy, and  I was like, you are the Coast Guard, and I am saying to you now, there's a submarine  attacking Lower Manhattan.  I'm saying it.  And they're like, we're trying to get park police over here. 
[01:47:30]  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  And he kept asking me to hover.  We kept hovering around it and stuff, and then finally this big police boat comes, shines  like a massive light on it, and then he calls me on the radio.  Hey, Captain, are you the one who reported this?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  You just hook up to it.  And I go, what if you don't see it?  And the guy goes, well, most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing. 
[01:48:00]  I have no business being on the water, and I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at  the Statue of Liberty to show it off to Chris and them.  Arrgh!  Ha ha!  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for.  Well, shiver me timbers, and all that bullshit.  Ah, pig leg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  Before there was a show, he was so slow.  He's growing up, Bobo! 
[01:48:30]  Bobo?  Ugh.  Can you come help me with my books?  They're too heavy for me to lift.  Well, that's the thing.  My unit doesn't lift stuff.  All it does is get boners and piss and, well, when I jack off the white stuff.  Bobo?  Who said anything about a unit?  And what do you mean, white stuff?  Oh, man, nice.  Nice and sexy, man. 
[01:49:00]  Bobo?  Are you paying any attention to me?  You keep looking at Mrs. Comzington.  Nice.  I'd love to have my face buried in those boobies.  Bobo?  What has gotten into you?  As I say, boobies always loosen me up.  Ew.  You're really weird.  I have no problem eating on an ass.  And I'd even take the train to Chocolate Town if you're into that.  Where did you learn this from?  I don't like to come off as a pervert. 
[01:49:30]  Too late.  I am telling.  Hold on.  Let me take this call for a second.  It's funny, mother.  Oh, mommy.  Oh.  Before there was a show, he was the flow.  He's growing up.  Whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Tighten your sphincter.  You wanted the best and you got it. 
[01:50:00]  The hottest band in the land.  Kiss.  This is for Jimmy.  One of the best openings for an album ever, by the way.  Boost.  Absolutely.  It's a lot.  Kiss announces a reunion tour with Makeup back in 1996 on this date.  Wow.  That's a long time ago already. 
[01:50:30]  Eighteen years, right?  Me and Jeff Ross went to Philly to see him.  96.  We saw it in Boston.  It was amazing.  First time I saw Kiss, too.  That's almost 20 years ago.  That's crazy.  Fucking dude.  Crazy to think.  How?  Rich Vossen's studio.  He was pretty close to Otto, as well.  You know, we, when, I mean, I got a lot of stories with Otto, but I remember when, this 
[01:51:00]  is before I even knew, what's her name, Norton, there was a one-nighter by my house.  Right.  It's where I met my ex-wife, the charter house or the goal post.  It was just, you know, and it was a pretty big one-nighter.  I just maybe started comedy or whatever, and I used to go, and I went to see, you know, just  go hang.  And Otto was working there.  And I'm going, this is the funniest man alive.  This is, you know, so anytime he worked, I had to bring people. 
[01:51:30]  You got to see this fucking guy.  He was one of those guys that you felt like you had to bring others and turn them on to  your friends.  You had to bring people.  Absolutely.  And then I started working, and I worked with him, you know, and.  How long was he doing comedy before you guys popped on the scene?  He was doing, I think, when he started, when he was like 15 years old.  14.  14.  14.  He did comedy for about 39 years.  So, what year did you start?  I, okay, I got 28 sober. 
[01:52:00]  I was doing it for three, like 30 years ago.  30 years ago.  You started 30 years ago.  Yeah.  I was at least nine years, he was probably 23 or 24 when you saw him, so he was at least  nine years into doing it, after street performing a lot of shit.  Yeah, wow.  And he, like, I mean, then, you know, this is a guy you go to see, and you're going,  this is, it's fucking so funny.  Right.  And, you know, and, and you're watching them, and you're, and we're going to fuck mannequins  at, uh, Macy's, and, uh.  I shop, wait.  I, uh, fuck. 
[01:52:30]  I, it's, um, I fucked the, I shop at Alexander's, but I fucked the mannequins at Macy's.  It was some play on that commercial.  He goes, you know, and Dr. Pecoraro, uh, a bit, there's a people all over the country  who doctor, Dr. Pecoraro was a back, Sam, can you Google Dr. Pecoraro?  He was a, he was a back doctor, and he did, he would come on and go, does your back hurt?  And he would just do this whole thing on, on, on a bad back.  Yeah.  And Otto did a bit on Dr. Pecoraro.  I like to break, I don't remember the bit, but it was so funny. 
[01:53:00]  Does your back hurt?  Give me $50, and I'll grab you by the cock, and swing you around my waiting room until  your asshole whistles.  Is that the line?  Yeah.  From 100, I'll paralyze you.  Give me all the quarters, and I'll paralyze you.  Wow.  He would go, and, I mean, just stop, you know, uh, you who would rock it out of my ass, I'd  shoot you, you know, just stop, and.  You had to bring that one up, huh?  Why?  Caused a lot of controversy on our show.  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  Anyhow, I don't know.  Because Jay might have used that line, and then there was a little, little beach.  Jay Moore?  A little beef between Jay and Otto.  That wouldn't be, he might.  Uh.  And Otto.  So.  Jay Rich said that, not me.  I'm friends with Jay.  He, what are you kidding me?  No, you're not.  Uh, what do you call it?  Otto was probably who, who, and I count him prior to say, probably the most quoted comic.  Oh, God, yeah.  Without a doubt back, I mean, I mean, people, when he worked in Vegas, everybody would flock 
[01:54:00]  to go see him, wherever he was, you know, all the entertainers and stuff, he was like  a cookie jar of antriloquists in Vegas whenever he went out there.  And it was filthy dirty, but it was like the dirty that even comedians respected.  It wasn't like, oh, he's too dirty.  He just made everybody, he made you belly laugh.  It didn't matter who you were.  Right.  You were fucking belly laugh watching this guy.  There was a brilliance to it.  A brilliance to it.  To be in dirty, that sounds crazy, obviously, but there's a lot of people, yeah, like you  said, if you get a dirty comic, you almost, you give him like a, oh, he's just a dirty 
[01:54:30]  comic.  But with Otto, there was a brilliance behind it.  When he, I remember one night we were getting high, me.  You used to get high with him?  Yeah, we got, we went to his, me, Bastille, Bastille was a heroin addict.  I was a coke addict.  And Otto would just like to get high.  And we went to his, I think he had a place in Staten Island.  And we're so fucked up.  It's the middle of the night.  And there was a big booker back there, Rick Messina, who manages to now. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we talked about him.  We know Rick.  So, Rick.  Rick loved Otto.  I know.  But we're sitting there, half nodding, and out of nowhere, Otto would pop and go,  fuck Messina.  But I hate, he goes, I call him, he goes,  I'm talking to the coast, and Otto would go, I'm on the coast, the east coast, right?  And then he, we're nodding, and he'd just wake him and go, fuck Gary Grant, right?  And it was just so funny.  And we were starving, and we'd go, do you have anything to eat?  He had, open a can, he had one can of fucking beans. 
[01:55:30]  So, like, it was like three fucking drug guys, hi, Sherry, Otto cooked us beans, right?  And we sat and ate fucking beans.  Being a drug addict sounds awful.  Yeah, I know.  But we had so much fun that night.  I mean, we had so much fun.  Me and Otto, we used to do these fucking, this guy used to book rooms.  He passed away, this guy, Mike Austin in Jersey.  When did he die?  I know the name.  I never knew him.  I don't know. 
[01:56:00]  But I mean, matter of fact, I did a gig for him.  And he was kicked out of his house.  So this guy took all of his stuff and was staying at a hotel.  And the room, the comedy room was in the hotel, and he was staying, you know, in a room there.  So after the gig, he didn't have any, he didn't have my money.  So I took his fucking TV that he had stored.  I'd say, look, I'm not, and, and, you know, and me and Otto did gigs with him.  Bob Woods, who passed away too.  These were all old school comics. 
[01:56:30]  And we used to do these fucking one-nighters in Jersey, Freddy's, and, and, was that a Sunday night gig?  I think I did that one time.  Freddy's, Freddy's was the first one-nighter in New Jersey.  The first one, I mean, Eddie Murphy worked there, all of them.  I worked there, you know, and, and, you know, and Chris Rock was middling.  Right.  You know, I mean, this was the, you know, the one, and I would do so many of these one-nighters with fucking Otto, you know.  And, and, you know, I got sober and stuff, but still, it was like a, you know, I wasn't as close to Otto as I, like, you know, Bobby Kelly or Norton or something. 
[01:57:00]  But with comedy, and I said this, once you work with a comic, wherever they're from, you have this common bond.  You might not even see them for five years or ten, but you'll remember that one gig you guys worked on together, and you have this, this bond.  It's, you know what I'm saying, it's kind of weird, you know.  I mean, you'll hear of comics, but once you work with them and experience the same place, but me and Otto did so many gigs. 
[01:57:30]  I'm sure me, you, and Otto have probably worked together.  Of course.  You know what we did?  We did Rascals.  Remember we did, when you first got an O&A, somehow it's, you know, you were just becoming a weasel, and you got an O&A, right?  And we did, we did, we did Rascals and, and, and Long Island, Governor, but Rascals, it was me, you, and Otto, and it was fucking mobbed.  I don't know if you remember, it was Rascals East, West Orange, you know, and, and you see, we did a benefit from him like five months ago. 
[01:58:00]  You know, it's so, it's, it's crazy as it was.  See, people don't realize, they see someone on stage and they think that's them, or that's that person, you know.  They don't get that a lot of it can be, but a lot of it also.  Otto was, couldn't have been a sweeter person, a nicer guy than, you know what I mean?  I've been saying that for the last couple of days.  Yeah, he was, he was a really nice human being.  You know, he just.  Really caring and appreciative. 
[01:58:30]  He was just a nice guy.  He, he knew everything about any fucking movie, if you want, you know, I mean, he used to do references.  His references were the fucking greatest.  Like, what would he, what would he, uh, oh, I forget.  He would always do, I know, I know he would always do some weird, like, Godzilla reference, but he just kept, remember, you used to when he'd go, Dr. Pecoraro must be destroyed.  And there was no reason for it.  And he would just be in the middle of something and then just go back into these weird movie moments.  But it was just so entertaining. 
[01:59:00]  You know, this is a good time.  Rob Bartlett, who works for Imus, uh, very good friends with him.  We all are.  And he texted me his fondest, uh, auto memory.  Can I read this without getting in trouble?  You never know these days.  Well, read it.  It's Asian stuff.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, is that, I think I know that joke.  Right.  I think I'm, are you quoting it?  Yeah.  I certainly am.  Uh, Rob Bartlett, fondest auto memory.  He writes me, uh, yesterday.  Rainy Nighthouse, uh, Belrose Queens.  I'm the house MC, auto on stage, Asian chick right up front, not having it. 
[01:59:30]  George says, I hate chinks.  And then says, you people aren't happy unless you got a monster chasing you.  Yeah, he was the first one doing bits like that.  Wow.  And I'll tell you why, if people are like, why is that funny?  I'll tell you why it's funny.  Because when a guy is, a guarantee the way that happened was auto was just kind of being  meek and the puppet looked at her when auto was looking somewhere else and just set it 
[02:00:00]  as an aside.  Right.  That's one of those things that it's, it's almost like there's two different individuals  on stage, even though it wasn't.  I got, uh, I got, uh, you don't like admitting this on this show, but I got teary eyed yesterday  because I was watching the David, uh, Copperfield video of David taking him through his museum  in Vegas of all the, uh, well, I guess you'd call them puppets.  So David Copperfield has an amazing, uh, selection of puppets.  He has Howdy Doody.  He has Lamp Chop.  He has pretty much all of them. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  He, he, he's got one of Otto's, right?  Yeah.  He's got, well, and then it was the big reveal at the end.  And I think they were kind of setting it up this way.  And then, and they're like, Jeff Dunham only cared about one puppet in this museum.  And it's this, and he, he, uh, you know, directs Otto's attention to, you know, George.  He's got one of the old, uh, George puppets and, uh, Otto looks at it and the line that  killed me goes, you're safe here.  I was like, Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  He was, uh, he was, I wasn't balling, but I got all fucking all sorts of teary eyed on that  one because you're safe here. 
[02:01:00]  And he meant it.  And that's what was so fucked up about it.  He patted him a little bit.  He patted it and said, you're safe here.  He was happy that George was in this, uh, David Copperfield, uh, museum or other ventriloquists.  You'd be with him and it was, I mean, ventriloquists, ventriloquists are weird.  Like he'd go, he would say stuff like, uh, you know what George thought of, you know,  in, in that almost like a split personality type thing.  See, I never experienced that stuff with him.  And I know I've heard guys who have, I've never experienced that stuff with him. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, it wasn't crazy.  He goes, Oh, guess what George, you know what I mean?  Maybe it was just another way of saying, uh, this is a funny line for George or something.  And yeah, you know, uh, it was, I think it takes a special person to be a ventriloquist.  So someone's really got to dig into that someday and try to figure it out a little bit.  Yeah.  I don't think Otto actually had a split personality, but this character he developed was pretty  damn serious to him.  No, not split.  Cause he didn't break out, out without the dummy and start talking. 
[02:02:00]  It might've been a way to say things that he wouldn't say himself.  Yeah.  You know, like, I don't say half this shit when I'm not on the radio.  That's because no one talks to you.  But it allows you to, you are quick.  It allows you to show another side of your personality that you just can't walk through  life doing.  God, we did so many fucking one-nighters.  Man.  So many.  He'll be missed.  That's for sure, man.  Man.  I used to pick him up too.  And he loved, because if you drove guys like Otto never got a license. 
[02:02:30]  So, you know, he had to be picked up and you never minded.  Like I would sit in traffic and go to Queens and get him or wherever he was in Manhattan.  And because it was Otto, it was, it felt just corny, but it was so special to work with  him.  And it always felt that way.  It never didn't feel like a weekend I was looking forward to or special.  Right.  So you never minded picking him up.  And that's weird.  And then later on in life, you send traffic just to pick up Queens.  That's right.  It's a lot of traffic around one block.  Exactly. 
[02:03:00]  Which is quick.  Yeah.  Do you call that thing, George?  Yeah.  We had.  And, you know, he was honest, too.  He was just, he was, it was one of those comics that everybody, I mean, people from all  over the country, when you go on a road would hear about Otto and George.  Everyone.  The first time I worked with Stanhope, we did, me and Doug did the Vail Comedy Festival. 
[02:03:30]  I think it was 1994.  Right.  And we were roommates.  And Doug is such, I've talked about what a kook Stanhope is because he would have all  his possessions on his bed.  He left everything on his bed, like just a whack job.  And.  What do you mean?  When he traveled?  Yeah.  Like all of the stuff came out and he just piled it up on his bed like a crazy hoarder.  And I remember Doug was telling me about Mitch Hedberg.  Wait, wait.  Doug would do that or Otto?  Stanhope.  Stanhope.  Hold on.  Can someone get the hotline?  Someone's ringing off the hook and no one's picking him up.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  That's okay.  Stanhope was telling me and quoting Mitch Hedberg, who he loved. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And I was talking about Otto, who I loved.  And we were just, because, you know, neither of us had worked with the other guy at that  point.  And they're both dead.  Jesus.  I just realized they're both dead.  I meant Mitch Hedberg the night he died, basically, at Caroline's.  Oh, that was.  First time I saw him, I was amazed by his act.  Heard about him forever, like anyone else, but finally went and saw him at Caroline's.  We met in the green room, exchanged numbers, gave me a huge hug, said, I can't wait to do  your show.  And literally, he was dead hours later. 
[02:04:30]  The day after he died, two days after he died, that's creepy, too.  The day, two days, like, Bonnie's like, was like best friends with his wife.  No, I know.  So they, Lynn called us, they were in Jersey, and we had to go pick, I had to go pick her  up at a hotel and bring her back to our house.  This is no bullshit.  I drive to the hotel.  The second I fucking pull in, my odometer said 666 at the end, and I had to drive the  car some more, obviously.  And then we had to pick her up. 
[02:05:00]  Why?  It doesn't mean anything.  That number doesn't mean anything.  Huh?  That number doesn't mean anything.  These three average cocks are going to go in your mouth.  Exactly.  I always prefer when 12-6 comes up.  At least you have one good one.  Wow.  This is a perfect time to take this phone call.  Colin.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Hey, I've been listening.  Please, please, please, I ask one thing only.  Yeah.  When I die, don't let boss ramble. 
[02:05:30]  What do you think when you die?  Look at your last special.  That's a non-fucking story.  Wait, you didn't think Rich?  I worked with Otto twice.  I have better stories than I have.  What am I going to do?  I'm just saying how respected he was.  We laughed.  What about, well, who knows?  But just let's all enjoy the entertainment of the idea that we laughed. 
[02:06:00]  It was probably something.  You didn't like Rich's bean-eating story?  No.  The what?  It was horrifying.  Bean-eating story.  That was a pretty good story.  It was horrendous.  I like a good drug story.  Any story with a punchline in Gary Grant, which I'm probably the only one who even knows it.  Yeah.  How about the time, did anyone talk about the time when Otto, with a certain, I don't know  where you're allowed to say, you know, his running partner at the time, you know, the 
[02:06:30]  big tall gentleman that did magic.  And, I mean, I don't know if I want to, but one time him and Otto, he had Coke.  Yeah.  And it was in a sucreste box.  And a guy kept going, come on, break out the sucreste box, Otto.  Break out the sucreste box.  And he had a sucreste box full of Coke, you know.  And then Otto goes, okay, but first you have to run, you have to run to the bus station.  So he makes him run to the bus station for a few lines and come back.  And then he comes back, he wants more Coke.  And Otto goes, okay, but you have to let me burn your clothes. 
[02:07:00]  He goes, what?  He goes, I have to burn your clothes.  And he makes me take his clothes off and burns his clothes for a few lines of Coke.  Holy shit.  That's not the noblest story.  Still, that's a good story.  That's a better drug story than Rich's.  Yeah.  Sorry.  He trumped you on the drug story.  No offense, Rich, but I knew that story.  I don't want to say, I don't want to do too many drug stories.  Well, you did it.  We were all high and we ate beans.  Right.  It was a bean story.  It wasn't a bean story.  It sounds like a Chip Chippison drug story. 
[02:07:30]  We were high and ate beans.  Fuck yeah, we got so zooled one time.  I had Chef Boyardee.  Where are you, Colin?  Downtown my house.  Oh, if you want to come in.  Why don't you come in?  What else are you doing?  He's got to get on the ferry.  Jump on a subway.  What do you mean?  No, he's done.  What are you doing?  You're fucking sitting there in front of your dumb computer drinking Diet Coke.  Yeah.  I'm looking at old SNL clips going, I was somebody.  Oh, Jesus.  What do you mean, Rich?  Fuck him.  I'm done with Colin.  What? 
[02:08:00]  Fuck him.  Enough already.  Fucking YouTube sensation.  Enough with him.  Done with his fucking one-man shows and Irishess and dad stretching on stage and pretend  that you fucking need to fucking need to fuck him.  Enough with him.  I'm done with him.  All right.  I'm ready.  I'm on him and his stupid cousin and the whole family and all comics.  He's like the fucking punch yourself out.  Yeah.  This is not the time.  We're all grieving.  We all need to, you know, stay strong and be one toward this tough time. 
[02:08:30]  During this tough time.  Exactly, boy.  No one needs your Discord.  You got to fucking drop Colin off at the end of the night and it takes you an extra half  an hour to get to the tunnel because he lives at the bottom of fucking Manhattan like a  famous guy lives in the financial district where nobody knows who he is.  He's just an asshole.  Nothing wrong with this kind of Discord.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with living in the financial district.  Why? 
[02:09:00]  Did I say it wrong?  No, why would you put the T where it belongs at the end of the word?  Why?  You said district, like a six-year-old.  No, I didn't.  I said district.  Colin, he's bragging about his IQ test again today.  Yeah, what was it?  I still haven't seen the, who is it, 148?  141.  Not 141.  141.  The last one I took was a little lower, but it was a tougher one.  Oh.  Wow.  There was some guy, no one a fan sent me one.  The average on this one was 100.  The average was 100.  And on this one, I got 120.  So I was 20 above average. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  I'm not lying.  All right.  You're a genius.  I'm not a genius.  I'm close to it.  Yeah.  All right, Colin, come on in.  No, I can't, guys, but enjoy you.  Well, what else do you have nothing to do?  Yeah.  I do have shit to do, actually, as a matter of fact.  What do you got to do?  An important appointment at 905.  At 905.  And let's be up there.  Why 905?  Because that's when Jerry wants to see him.  Oh. 
[02:10:00]  All right, Colin.  Thank you so much, buddy.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  We'll see you soon.  Colin Quinn.  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  He's in the top three funniest people alive, Colin Quinn.  What's the other term?  Well, Rich will obviously include himself.  Jim Lorton and me.  All right, we'll take a break.  I got clips from the podcast with Chip that your ex did.  Okay.  Just a few, just a little taste.  Okay.  A couple short clips that I want to play for everybody.  Sam, do they make Chip sound good?

Listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio jam.  I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice. 
[02:23:00]  I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad, and then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double, but I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys, what do you think of my...  I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver, but it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here.  I'm very proud of this move. 
[02:23:30]  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  And now look, I jumped over there, but look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am.  Now I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching for the sun right here.  And now I'm reaching, reaching.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin. 
[02:24:00]  And look at my hair.  My hair's flying like when...  I call this the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hammer camel, but now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now.  Now look, I got some speed up.  I see that.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad, a triple, and a triple.  Oh!  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh! 
[02:24:30]  Bop!  Now I'm going...  Look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards.  Look at my hair.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, Dice.  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help.  It helps with the atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing it down, Elv.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very...  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump. 
[02:25:00]  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at this.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump the midget.  Oh!  Look at that.  Now I look. 
[02:25:30]  I put my leg on top of the midget.  And he's skating like he's my leg.  I bent it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates.  You're running on your toes, I see.  Eeeeh!  Eeeeh!  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go,  Oh, Dice, why do you have to be so good at skating?  I go, take the sea out of your way. 
[02:26:00]  Faggot!  Oh!  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop!  A spin!  Give me a perfect score!  Eeeeh!  Bump!  The gold medal's fine!  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I threw my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  On SiriusXM.  We've got Rich Voss in the studio today. 
[02:26:30]  And Rich is going to be at the Bridge Street Live in Connecticut tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Then he's going to Maine, Smitty's Cinema Pub in Sanford, Maine.  Where's Sanford, Maine?  I don't know.  Or is it pub?  Where is that?  I don't know.  I don't know where anything in Maine is. 
[02:27:00]  And then in Manchester, New Hampshire, at Millie's Tavern on Saturday night.  Go see Rich Voss.  That's a fundraiser, too.  Go Saturday.  A fundraiser?  Well, that's what I took.  I took that first to Saturday because they're raising money for...  I don't care!  I don't care!  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care!  What were you saying?  It's for kids.  Huh?  What is it?  Nothing.  Getting Viagra?  The New York Times did an amazing obit on Otto. 
[02:27:30]  Amazing.  Holy shit.  Really, really well done.  Well written.  Otto didn't like when people would talk about George.  Like, he's used to hate him.  They'd go, take George out.  What was George's...  Right.  But the quote they used really was...  At times, you know, there were goddamn good writers that worked for this paper.  Or, is the woman, the quote writes, George, the dummy who knew no limits will speak no  more.  Which I thought was just a really great quote.  He would be happy with this.  Right.  He would like this a lot.  I tweeted it.  And we're all tweeting it.  And, you know, you'll find it yourself as well. 
[02:28:00]  Our pal in the New York Times.  Wow.  All right.  So lousy.  And there's going to be no service, you're saying?  Don't know yet.  You know, Trish said that she doesn't know if they're going to do it.  And his family probably agrees.  I don't hate it.  I remember years ago talking about wakes and say, I'm fucking going to go stand there  and look at a dead guy.  You know, that's how Otto was.  That's creepy.  That's really creepy. 
[02:28:30]  That's Otto's laugh.  Holy shit.  Wow.  You know what I did?  I was thinking, I think he did it too.  And I know you did it.  Do you remember doing a Rick Turner show in New Jersey?  I never did that.  Yeah, the guy thought he was Letterman.  Never did it.  He's a caucus.  No.  Huh?  I never did it.  You didn't?  I swear.  Florentine might have done it.  Yeah.  And Otto.  These are all, just all the, I'm sorry, I can't say any of this stuff because I don't  want to upset Colin because there's no punchlines.  But we did all of these fucking weird things. 
[02:29:00]  Colin's in the shower right now.  He has his, what's that?  No, he's not.  He's in the shower right now.  He has his 905 meeting.  Exactly.  905.  He's running his hand over his scruff going, another day won't hurt.  Creep.  Shit already.  You think he's drinking tea somewhere?  Yeah, of course he's drinking tea.  Right.  Jotting down little things on his computer.  That he wants to talk about at the meeting?  Yeah.  The big 905 that we've got together.  He's got.  The 905.  One man show idea.  Shower.  Idea.  All right, so we got clips from, it pains me to say this, but Chip did a podcast. 
[02:29:30]  It was the first real interview Chip ever did.  This is the first real interview?  Yeah, you guys have seen Chip.  Why haven't we interviewed Chip?  I don't know.  You guys didn't want to, but this was a real sit down talk with Chip about his life.  Right.  And some would say he's an ass.  And it's Jim Norton's ex-girlfriend.  Jennifer, yeah.  Who you're still in touch with.  She's my best friend.  And she's now podcasting.  Yeah.  She came out of the box strong, man, because people are checking this one out. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, she's getting better at it.  She's, you know, she's literally, it's her first time ever doing any of this stuff.  But she's legitimately funny.  And she knows Chip and fucking Edgar, who she loathed, and Uncle Paul.  Those characters probably would not have lasted as long as they did if it was not for her.  So you can either thank her or blame her.  And she would have real conversations with Chip and Edgar and the rest of them.  Constantly.  I've been in cars.  Where, like, that's how they used to converse. 
[02:30:30]  It was amazing to watch.  I'm like, are you going to break character?  Or is she going to say enough, Jim?  And she never, never did.  She just went with it.  She dresses Chip as Chip.  She knows who's her.  Are we boring you?  Oh, I love this.  Why did you fart?  But farting is nothing to do with it.  It's got to go somewhere.  It's got to go somewhere.  I can't believe your mouth isn't behind me.  Oh, God.  Damn. 
[02:31:00]  So we got a little, uh...  We got some clips from the Chip interview with Jen.  Yeah, go to Carmody Central.  And I have no...  I just...  I want to see Chip, uh...  Chip get his due.  Okay.  She's doing well on iTunes.  She is, yeah.  Yeah, so...  Here's, uh...  I don't even...  I guess it's...  Oh, okay.  Chip and Jen's history together.  Jen being Jim Norton's ex-girlfriend.  No, she was Chip's two.  Chip's two.  Okay.  I don't know how I'd even describe it.  It's an interesting friendship. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, you was always, like, into me.  And you used to send me, like, all kinds of notes and stuff.  Hey, what's up?  That never happens.  What's up, Chip, huh?  I never ask what's up, Chip.  So let me introduce you, at least.  This is my friend, Chip Chipperson.  Fuck, yeah.  How about this?  Hold on.  Just stop this for a second.  I'll say something like...  Remember you used to chase me around?  And you can go,  Oh, that's right, Chip.  That never happens.  Hold on.  All right.  Now, stop playing.  Okay.  Hey, remember you used to chase me around?  It didn't happen, Chip.  That's fucked up.  However, we do have a bit of a history. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Chip and I did hook up at one point.  Fuck, yeah.  It was literally one point.  It was, like, literally, like a minute.  It was hot, though.  You were into it.  I wasn't.  Yes, you were.  No, it was completely out of guilt.  No, it wasn't out of guilt.  I felt down there, you was so wet, it was like somebody threw a bunch of legs in your  underpants.  That never happened.  Yes, it did.  I remember I was jamming my fingers in like that, and you was fucking creaming like wheat.  Makes me uncomfortable. 
[02:32:30]  Does it?  Chip stinks.  He's an idiot.  But what?  She blew Chip or something?  In Montreal.  Not Jim Norton.  Chip.  Oh, no, she blew Chip.  She fucked, never fucked Chip, she fucked Sudley.  Who's Sudley?  Sudley was retarded and would just go, Jennifer, and then lick her face.  Sudley was awful, and she said Uncle Paul was a better fuck than Sudley.  You should be a ventriloquist. 
[02:33:00]  You could have a whole trunk of different, you know, puppets that you could break out.  It's just fun.  It's just a way to, you know, different parts of the person.  Chip, thinking the recording paused, talks about his mom, so Chip didn't realize that  the podcast was still recording.  I think Chip likes to make things look like they're improv sometimes, and he expects people  to honor his request.  Okay.  My mother always told me, Chip, I don't tell no lies, because when you do the devil's  ears, grow big.  Saint on earth, my mother.  She's a good, marvelous woman. 
[02:33:30]  No, she's not.  Hold on.  Turn this off for a second.  Leave out the stuff about my mother and Lamar, like how, like the stuff where I would come  home and she'd be wiping his penis off in the kitchen with the towel.  I don't want to say nothing.  It's not funny.  It's disgusting.  But I don't want to say nothing on your podcast.  So don't say nothing about my mother and how she would always lay down with coloreds.  Well, let's talk.  Hold on a second.  I just don't want you to talk about that, because people would always yell, hey, Chipper, 
[02:34:00]  your mother's fingers smell like watermelon.  Hey, Chipper, how come your mother's fingers always smell like cocoa butter?  She would have to rub cocoa butter into Lamar's calves in his feet when he'd be fixing the  floorboards in her room.  And I'd stand outside.  Fixing the floorboards?  Yeah.  You think they were fixing them?  Yes, they were.  And I would stand outside the bushes and I would look and my mother would go, get out  of there, Chipper, quit peeking.  So you used to watch?  Yeah, I'd be in there watching.  Did you like what you saw?  No, they would be fixing it.  My mother's very Ruben-esque. 
[02:34:30]  She'd be on her back and her legs would be up in the air.  She'd be just looking at the seal and paint to make sure that it wasn't cracking.  Oh, my God.  But don't say that on the podcast.  Just keep that between us.  Okay, so let's talk about your mother a little bit.  Okay, we're back right now.  That was a fun little break for the commercials.  How long did you have to deal with it?  41 minutes.  I need to know.  But Chip wants to know.  Uncle Paul stepped in and carried a little bit of the load. 
[02:35:00]  It would help, but yeah.  Okay.  Chip didn't understand it was podcast.  Podcast.  A podcast.  Are people listening to this, listening to what he's saying, or listening, going, when  will this end?  A little bit of both.  Of course.  Yes.  Chip is an ass, but people never hear Chip talk, so.  Right.  Well, not.  You watch how well this podcast does.  It's doing well for her.  Yes, it is.  Chip, the fucking Chip view from Anthony, just got over a broken million views.  A million views for Chip Ruins the Mood. 
[02:35:30]  Really?  Yeah, Chip is good in small bursts.  This just happened to be an interview, just to talk, but Chip's usually in fast hum, hum,  hum, hum, hum.  But you get to know Chip.  A little bit, yeah.  People don't know much about Chip.  Yeah, they don't.  And where he comes from.  Chip's birthday party.  I did want to talk about your mom a little bit.  She's a wonderful woman.  Yeah, apparently.  Dolores.  Saint on earth.  No, she's not.  Yes, she is.  But let's see.  You talk a lot about this birthday party that you had when you were growing up.  I didn't have the birthday party. 
[02:36:00]  I was supposed to have a bunch of friends over, and I was laying out all the little, I laid out all the forks and knives.  And I was like, Ma, when are they coming?  And she's like, they're busy, Chip, but they'll be here later.  She was yelling out from the bedroom.  She had a friend over.  He was helping her.  Fix the floorboards.  Yeah, I think so, because the bed kept creaking, so I think he was trying to oil the springs or something.  But none of my friends were coming to the party, so I had all the hats laid out.  So you bought all these little hats? 
[02:36:30]  I bought a bunch of hats, and I bought a bunch of paper plates.  Little birthday plates?  Yeah, they said happy birthday on them.  And I bought a bunch of birthday napkins and a bunch of forks and knives.  And I was like, Ma, did you invite all the people?  And she goes, yeah, yeah, Chipper.  I guess they're busy.  So I just kept knocking on the door.  I'm like, Ma, could you call them and see if they're coming?  But she wouldn't open the door.  She was like, go out there and play or something, Chipper.  So then what did you end up doing on your birthday? 
[02:37:00]  Well, it was really, she got mad at me, because I got up real early to go to the store.  I got up at like 7, and I thought the whole neighborhood was going to come.  So I had like 20 chairs and stuff around the table and in the living room and a bunch of like pin the tail on the donkey and things of that nature.  And then I went to the store.  I bought a bunch of plates and a bunch of napkins and a bunch of happy birthday balloons.  And I put them all up.  I'm like, this is going to be fucking great.  And no one came.  So I was like, Ma, did you call everybody? 
[02:37:30]  Because she was supposed to call everyone and invite them to my birthday party.  And no one showed up.  So about, I guess about 8 o'clock at the night, she was still in the bedroom.  I guess the bed was really messed up, because then I just heard snoring.  So I'm like, I guess he must have fixed it, because everyone else was snoring away.  So I just put all the plates and stuff back.  Did you ever get to use them?  No.  No, I didn't use them for nothing.  They were in the garbage the next day.  Lamar threw them out.  Oh, see, this is like the thing that as hateable as Chip is. 
[02:38:00]  What do you mean?  That's fucked up.  When you actually do things that are sad, they're like so sad.  They like rip your heart out.  What?  I just had a, it was all the people in the neighborhood were probably busy or something.  No, they just didn't come for you, champ.  That's not true.  They were just busy.  Oh my God, I hate you.  I just fucking hate you.  Rich, comment? 
[02:38:30]  It's kind of funny, because I hate that character, but this is funny.  This is like, that was a touching story about the party.  What do you mean you hate that character?  How dare you?  Yeah, what?  Only kidding.  It's right next to you.  That story was, and it's sad, because that really did happen to him in real life.  One more clip.  Chip's girlfriends.  What about in high school?  Were you more popular in high school?  Yeah, fucking chicks were all over me in high school. 
[02:39:00]  Couldn't get them off me.  I was like, what the fuck?  Leave me alone.  Tell the truth for once, Chip.  They were.  It was all over me.  Tell the truth for once.  This is the exclusive interview.  You might as well be honest.  I am being honest.  I would just not go with none of them, no.  Oh, really?  So you didn't have a girlfriend?  No.  I didn't want one.  Have you ever had a girlfriend?  So what?  Sure I have.  Scarlett Johannesburg likes me a lot.  She would always send me letters like, I love your fucking music and stuff and things 
[02:39:30]  of that nature.  You used to say that I was your girlfriend for a while, and then I found out that you  were telling people that.  Yeah, you are, though.  You was always like, hey, what's up, Chip?  And then, supposedly, you left me for Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  Yeah, she would always call me, and she would be like, hey, why don't you come on tour with  me or something?  I'd be like, whatever.  Whatever.  I was like a little monster.  I didn't give a fuck.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Mama Monster wanted me.  Oh, God.  She would peck her juice in her face.  Ew.  Hold on a second. 
[02:40:00]  Turn the tape off.  I don't want people to start thinking I'm a virgin.  Don't start saying that, because they're going to start thinking, boy, Chip, I never  had sex, except for the one time with Jenny Calm.  Don't fucking say that.  We did not have sex, though.  Whatever.  Don't say nothing.  I don't want people to start thinking I'm a fucking virgin.  It's humiliating.  Well, we did open up with, you know, us hooking up, but then you just glazed over it because  you had to talk about how funny you were instead.  Okay, hold on.  All right, we're back. 
[02:40:30]  Remember that time that you sucked my pecker in Montreal?  Oh, that was fucking hot.  Remember that?  Because I felt bad for you.  Oh, my God.  That goes on for 40 minutes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Good for Jen.  If you listen carefully, the voice goes almost from, like, some Jewish guy from Brooklyn to  a gay guy from up in, you know, like, Spanish Harlem or something.  Does it?  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  I'm telling you.  Chip's inflection?  Yeah.  Yeah, you might be right.  All right.  Funny.  That's fucking funny.  Thank you.  That's weird.  It's fun to do, though.  It's supposed to be weird.  All right.  What else is going on today?  Nothing if you had to do that.  Well?  Actually, that weirdo up in Boston, you saw the video of the guy going toward the finish  line, and he puts down a backpack, and he's admitting he just wanted attention. 
[02:41:30]  Who is this guy?  Ew, really?  You haven't seen the video?  No.  I heard about that.  It was a joke.  And he was dressed like a widow or something, right?  Yeah.  He had a black veil on.  Really creepy.  Who is this?  DeRosa.  Do we know anything else about this guy?  And then he just puts the backpack near the finish line.  Do they arrest him?  Yeah, for disorderly conduct or something.  What a fucking asshole. 
[02:42:00]  It turns out.  I don't know.  Two backpacks that had been abandoned on Boylston Street.  Both devices have been safely detonated.  They detonated them?  Police tell us one man is in custody.  Let's get right to our Katie Bracers line.  What?  The very latest on all that's going on down there this evening.  Katie?  And, Jonathan, police just briefed us on what happened here.  This all started when they say a man was acting suspiciously. 
[02:42:30]  He had a backpack, and when officers asked him what was in that backpack, he said a rice cooker.  We have learned that that was a rice cooker filled with confetti.  Obviously, at that time, police did not know that, and they took precautions.  Let's go to some of the video we have of what it looked like down here earlier.  Now, the police did not just deal with one backpack.  They actually dealt with two backpacks.  They detonated that first one, and they also saw a second backpack.  They tell us that was filled with camera equipment. 
[02:43:00]  As you can imagine, at that time, they did not know this.  Now, as a precaution, police evacuated the block on Boylston Street by the finish line.  They told everyone to stay away from windows and doors.  Now, I want to also show you some video captured by a WBZ photographer as well.  The man police say was acting suspiciously, and this gives you an idea of the mood down here, of the heightened awareness.  Now, a witness tells me this man was acting erratically. 
[02:43:30]  He was dressed all in black.  He was running barefoot and yelling, Boston Strong.  Of course, one year after the attack, police are not taking any chances down here.  That's one of the sides of the fact that, yes, with the marathon coming, we are taking it serious.  Our officers have been trained in looking for any kind of suspicious activity,  and when it is brought to their attention or they notice it, which is, in this case, they act upon it. 
[02:44:00]  And we have learned the suspect's name is Kayvon Edson.  He is 25 years old.  He reportedly has some emotional issues.  Of course he does.  He has several charges, including carrying a hoax device.  We're on live in Boston.  What a fucking asshole.  That's a charge?  A hoax device?  Thanks very much.  Wow.  What a fucking asshole.  Looking for his stupid attention.  Yeah, another mental, another fucking mental problem.  Right.  Another me, me, me mental problem. 
[02:44:30]  Everyone blames everything else, but it's the fucking way we deal with mental illness.  That's another example of it.  Exactly.  No regard for anybody but his own selfishness.  Just fucking put him down.  The marathon's Monday.  You think they're going to be able to control it?  Do you know how many people come out for that damn thing?  I think so.  You think so?  You think it'll be all right?  I think so, sure.  I hope.  I mean, I'm being wished.  Of course.  Of course we all hope.  So that was happening in Boston.  Man. 
[02:45:00]  These fucking assholes, they do stuff like that for attention, but doesn't know how it affects the families.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  No, they don't care.  Of course.  They don't give a fuck whatsoever.  So.  All right.  We're going to take a break here, and we're going to continue with Rich Voss and Jim Norton,  who's going to be at Caroline's next weekend.  Next Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Tomorrow night is the big 20th anniversary. 
[02:45:30]  Unmasked.  Unmasked, which is going to be great in front of a live audience at Caroline's.  Ron's interviewing Opie and Anthony.  I'll come out at one point, but it's going to be very interesting to hear you guys discuss a lot of those old-day stuff in front of a live audience.  Yeah, we're pretty excited about it, all kidding aside.  Yes.  And we've got these posters, and everyone's going to get a chance at the posters.  What time is it?  Right now?  No, you're doing.  It's at four.  The thing's at four?  Yeah.  I might be at four. 
[02:46:00]  Four in the afternoon, so.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  Because you laughed.  Why?  Because it was kind of like, it was like, you were finally being positive, but then Vaughn had to ask what time it was.  And it kind of brings up everything.  It does bring up everything.  Yeah, because it'd be like, you probably thought you were going to say like eight.  Rich and Bonnie did a live podcast at the Village Underground for two hours on a Thursday night.  At four?  No, it was Tuesday night.  Was it a Tuesday night?  Yeah, it was a Tuesday night.  And no one had to rush out.  They had plenty of time to do the podcast and hang with like fans and listeners and whatnot and sign some things. 
[02:46:30]  And we have to sign the posters ahead of time because we don't have enough time.  Because they have to get the room ready for other things.  Then why can't you start an hour earlier so you have time?  We already did that.  We were supposed to start at five.  So now we're at four o'clock.  So we have a little time.  How are the fans going to get their parents to drop them off that early? 
[02:47:00]  Because most of their parents are working.  Good one.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Your ears.  On Sirius XM.

[02:56:00]  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is.  We're gonna fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality, and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.

Little dick motherfucker couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool's in. 
[02:57:00]  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trend-setting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey, Jim, did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad? 
[02:57:30]  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops, turn it up.  Middle finger time.  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh, my God, you're so old, you should have called dirt by name or something. 
[02:58:00]  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes, hello, well, whatever.  You're, uh, grody, yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk, like, with my butt or something?  Calling in to your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is.  Boys, how are you? 
[02:58:30]  There's Joe Piscopo.  We know that, boys.  Joe Piscopo, it's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, hey, watch the, watch the, watch the, watch the, watch the, I'm trying to keep it nice. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted to plug, too, uh, in Scottsdale, tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Only the good place is for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's just bad you didn't have a beach holiday. 
[02:59:30]  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage.  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:00:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  It's time for another Adventures with Alex Jones.  Adventures with Alex Jones.  Today, Alex goes to space.  They're coated with some type of narcotic to lull us into a false sense of security.  The Chiners.  They coat their rubber dog shit in vomit.  In lead paint to deform our children. 
[03:00:30]  Gulf of Tonkin, false flag operation.  Gulf of Tonka toy.  You ever see Finster from the Bugs Bunny cartoons?  Finster.  Everybody thought Finster was a baby.  But Finster was actually the crook, the mastermind.  And Bugs Bunny couldn't even really deal with Finster, baby. 
[03:01:00]  He just spilled the beans.  It's obviously a Manchurian candidate type of situation.  False flag operation.  Gulf of Tonkin.  That's all for this week, kids.  Tune in next time for more Alex Jones...  ...adventures. 
[03:01:30]  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Anthony show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, God, enough.  Let's get back on.  Thank you.  Opal and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Ant's out today, but he should be all right for tomorrow's unmasked at Caroline's.  Whatever it is, he's infected Travis.  They probably got it from each other's dicks.  And I also have a bit of a sore throat, too.  Yes, it's a strange day.  Everyone's falling apart around here. 
[03:02:00]  But we're doing it.  Yes.  Thank you, Rich Voss, for stepping up today.  And Dean Norris is coming in for a little bit towards the end of the show, which is great.  Yeah, he just wants to say hi.  He's kind of a friend.  I finally saw the entire Breaking Bad.  I had not seen it when he was in last time.  I finally saw...  He was fucking tremendous.  He's a great actor.  Tremendous actor, that guy.  I just finished Rich Man, Poor Man.  Good one.  Yeah, I always know Voss knows Obama's coming because he looks down like it's a casual aside. 
[03:02:30]  Right, right.  He's looking down, but his little heart is looking up.  Huh, guys?  Huh, guys?  Please like this one.  Please laugh at this one.  You're killing today.  You don't know who Rich Man, Poor Man was.  I do.  I remember.  It was a miniseries or something.  Who was the star in it?  Nick Nolte.  You knew that.  I did know that.  How did you know that?  Because I'm not stupid.  I'm older than I am.  That was a big deal back in the day.  I want to congratulate U.S. Airways for doing the right thing.  Absolutely.  Corporations never do the right thing, but they did.  Did you see the tweet with the plane and the pussy? 
[03:03:00]  What, the right thing is sending out that picture?  Yes.  Well, that was the right thing.  Absolutely.  Did you see it?  You saw the picture, right?  Yeah, I didn't get a picture.  That pussy is disgusting.  Oh, it's a nice big pussy.  Look at that.  No, that's rough.  That's rough.  Wait, look.  The plane's in there.  It looks like it landed in the pussy.  That's fucking rough.  Could you make it bigger?  You can't make that any bigger.  That's hilarious.  That woman who did that with her legs up is fucking hilarious.  That's not a Photoshop? 
[03:03:30]  That's actually...  Yeah, it's not a real plane.  Okay.  Her asshole is as big as her pussy hole.  See, I like a deep asshole.  That's fucking rough, man.  Look at that fatness, that disgusting hump above her pussy.  I like a nice fucking speed bump.  I like a nice deep asshole.  Like when the fucking crack goes way in.  Yeah, but there's no nuts there.  It looks like...  But what was the sense of that?  Why would they tweet that?  She did it as a joke. 
[03:04:00]  What happens is...  They wind up...  What is it?  They wind up retweeting it.  It was probably a retweet.  Where are you going, Rich?  I'm talking to you.  You're a bad asshole and you just...  Turn.  Turn.  Turn sideways and it looks like eye sockets without the eyeballs.  Jesus Christ, look at the fucking ass.  What a beast.  I think she might, you know...  She might allow that a lot.  So anyway, that photo went viral. 
[03:04:30]  And U.S. Airways saying it was an honest mistake by an employee.  And that employee will not be fired.  That's so great.  Wow.  Wow.  They probably talked to the person and did the human thing and the...  You know, it's not that you can tell when people are bullshitting you half the time.  What, Sam?  But the best part about the tweet, for anybody that didn't see it, is...  Right.  Not only is it a picture of a woman with a plane shoved in her vagina...  Yeah.  But the tweet itself says, responding to somebody's complaint, we're sorry to hear this.  We'd always hear this, Alex, yes. 
[03:05:00]  Please provide feedback to our customer service relations team here.  Right.  And it points to the vagina.  Right.  Talk to the pussy if you have a problem.  By the way, you know what...  And you're an asshole, obviously, because the asshole's in the picture, too.  I'm realizing this.  That was not U.S. Air doing the right thing.  Why?  U.S. Airways doesn't say what this really is.  Huh.  This is not a human response.  We have an automatic bot responding to you that picks up keywords.  So no human responded to this. 
[03:05:30]  This was probably just a computer responding, and they probably hadn't figured out anybody  putting a plane in their pussy and twittering it.  So this was a computer mistake, I'm guessing.  So they're like, well, and the employee, they mean, is probably the person who programmed  it.  Right.  So they're technically not lying.  Oh, so there was no employee to fire.  I'm guessing.  Holy shit, you're brilliant.  Well, look at this.  We don't like to hear this, Alex.  Please provide feedback to our customer care relations team here.  Or it's a cut and paste thing. 
[03:06:00]  There's no employee involved.  You're right.  There might not be.  Because I was very surprised no one was fired.  But if it isn't an actual person, you can't fire, unless they can make believe it was a  person.  Well, no, but then you'd be able to check on that.  They don't want you to know that no one is really reading your tweets.  And again, unless it's somebody who reads it and takes one of five options and hits  that response.  Yeah.  Customer service is garbage.  It's garbage for every company.  Every company.  Including this one, sorry to say.  But they did say at the town hall yesterday that they're working on improving customer 
[03:06:30]  service here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Well, Jim Meyer said that to us, too.  He said they're working on the app.  Like, he was aware of certain things that needed fixing.  And he addressed it even before, I think, we asked.  He's like, this is what they are fixing it.  It's just going to take a while.  It was screwed up by people before me.  You know, he was pretty honest about it.  Why did customer service get so bad across the board?  Do you think it was us as people complaining?  Part of that, but part of it was simply the expense.  It's cheaper.  Like, Western Union, to me, is the worst company I've ever done business with because 
[03:07:00]  their customer service is all in the Philippines.  Right.  Like, you can't have a real discussion.  Right.  I'll tell you who's got great customer service.  Apple.  Their customer service is fucking awesome.  Right.  Talk to a real person who knows what you want, knows your...  Same with tech support with them.  That's what I mean.  That's what I'm saying.  Their whole operation.  There's a guy who speaks English properly or a woman who speaks English.  They realize that's important, and they're probably spending a lot of money on that.  And other companies, they're thinking, ah, we could save an expense here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They did a cost analysis.  What's cheaper? 
[03:07:30]  Right.  The people we will lose because our customer service sucks, or the money we'll have to pay  to customers.  Yeah.  Sure.  Obviously, you'll save money by not paying people to do proper customer service.  Well, let's learn about this picture a little bit.  The X-rated photo publicly shared by the Major Airline Monday originated from an undisclosed  Twitter user who posted it on their feed before it was flagged as inappropriate, according  to a spokesman.  It was an honest mistake.  The pornographic tweet by U.S. Airways that was viewed around the world was inadvertently  included when tweeting to their customers and won't lead to an employee's firing. 
[03:08:00]  It was an honest mistake.  It was an attempt to flag the tweet as inappropriate.  We captured it, flagged it as inappropriate.  So, I think Jimmy's absolutely right.  I'll tell you the worst.  There's no employee involved with this one.  The worst is another airline.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  And then we'll get to you, Rich.  This guy might have more info on it.  Go ahead, Paul, and Freehold.  All right.  Paul.  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  Real quickly, the line in that tweet, and I respectfully disagree with Jimmy that a human 
[03:08:30]  did do this, because when you see the full line of tweeting that went on, there was some  girl named Alex who said, U.S. Air, thank you for ruining my day with all your delays.  And that was the response that they gave.  And what Opie just said about they flagged it, and it got sucked up there by accident.  Okay.  Maybe you're right, dude.  It's just because of the wording in that response.  Maybe they have one of five options, but it always says the same thing. 
[03:09:00]  I liked Jimmy's theory on the whole thing, because we're very surprised when a company  actually sticks up for their employees when they do something over the top like this,  even if it's by accident.  I don't think there was a human involved, because if you really read into airlines and  their customer service, they want everyone to go to social media now.  That's how they answer most of their complaints.  If you have a true complaint about airlines, you've got to go to Twitter and they answer  it.  So I think it is monitored by humans. 
[03:09:30]  You might be right.  They might answer it, but they won't solve your fucking problem.  You had a problem recently, Rich Ross?  Yeah, with Air Canada.  Complete fucking horrible.  What happened to you?  Yeah, they fucked me once.  They fucked me.  I mean, I want to tell you, no, they are.  Bonnie booked last Christmas a flight to go see.  What did he say?  I don't want to tell you on the air?  Yeah, he did just say that.  No, I said I've got another airline thing that you've got to hear.  I didn't see that at all.  Yeah.  Are you telling it on the air or not?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[03:10:00]  Now, fuck the Air Canada.  They just ripped us off for $400.  They said to Bonnie, you can book this flight.  You can fly into Canada with this type of ID.  Right.  Then a week before the flight, she confirmed me and they said, no, you can't do this.  And Bonnie goes, well, you told me we could.  And they go, well, and they blamed her.  And I got a phone.  I go, maybe one of your employees made a mistake.  They go, well, you can reissue the tickets, but you lose $400.  Whatever.  And you're never going to get it back.  But the worst airline, he would get so pissed off. 
[03:10:30]  On Southwest, I'm looking at, I lasted 30 seconds of this fucking flight attendant that  thinks she's a comic.  And she's doing her fucking.  You weren't on that plane.  No, no.  I was watching it on.  Oh, let's play that.  We got to play that yesterday.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, go ahead.  What's even worse is the fucking passengers laughing.  Right.  Like, it's, I just want to fucking, I hate people.  Okay, I thought you had a story that happened to you.  No, no.  No, this video went viral.  We didn't get to it yesterday.  We might as well play it here. 
[03:11:00]  It's hilarious.  Southwest attendant, flight attendant in midlife crisis must meet.  What?  What is the title?  Hilarious SWA flight attendant in midlife crisis must meet Ellen and Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  She's got 5.3 million views on this.  Yeah.  And not in a good way.  How many likes and dislikes?  No, no.  They're all likes.  21,000 likes.  People liked her shit?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why are we even trying? 
[03:11:30]  Why are we even trying?  Perfect.  You're right.  Some of these comments, like that flight attendant totally makes it worth getting the back strain  from those seats.  Better than a comedy club show.  Oh.  I'm not a fan of Southwest, but being on one of her flights to hear her monologue made  it worth flying with us.  Oh, my God.  It's quite funny.  I took it off after 20 seconds.  I got so mad at this.  You just got to love smart people.  It's got how many? 
[03:12:00]  5.3 million.  Fucking unbelievable.  Me and Walter on a plane, by the way, where they tried to be funny on that Pan Am flight  we took.  Oh, no.  It was Carnival Air.  It was one of some awful flights you and I were on together.  Yeah.  And I tried to be funny.  That's my first time doing this.  The fucking pilot came out and was talking.  I wanted to kill myself.  All right.  Let's have an open mind here.  She's cute.  I'm going to have your attention for just a few moments.  My ex-husband, my new boyfriend, and their divorce attorney are going to show you the  safety pieces. 
[03:12:30]  It's been a long day for me.  So properly fasten your seatbelt, slide the flat into the buckle to release, lift up  on the buckle.  Position your seatbelt tight and low across your hips.  Like my grandmother wears her support bra.  If you can make me want to text your toys and get on, there's eight ways to get there.  Two forward exit doors, short wing window exits, two rear exit doors, signs overhead,  disco lights on the floor, leave each exit.  Everybody gets the door prize in the seat back pocket in front of you, along with  dirty diapers, chewing gum, rindlers, banana peels, and all that gives you leave for us.  It's a safety information card.  Take it out.  Check it out. 
[03:13:00]  You'll notice in the highly unlikely event that the Captain Lens Snare hot tub, everybody  gets their very own teeny-weeny yellow Southwest bikini.  Fuck yeah!  Are you loving this?  Fucking hilarious!  I'm telling you, I'm just going to start making flight announcements on stage now.  Are you sure?  That's what the audience is doing.  No, it's embarrassing.  She has practiced this a million times.  I'll say that.  Her delivery is flawless.  She's speaking fast and flawlessly delivering these awful jokes. 
[03:13:30]  And she's got a really nice breast in place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can see it through the little...  Look at the white people laughing.  ...the little outfit.  All right.  Keep going.  Chip's loving it.  Take it out on the shelf to do so.  Place it over your head.  Have that strap around your waist.  Take it out and pull the plate.  One side side.  Pull them in the red tab and inflate to manually inflate the tube at your shoulder.  The questions are coming, but I'm hoping that you'll tell them how good-looking they are.  We're going to make sure your seat backs and trace everywhere.  And they're full, upright, and absolutely blust and comfortable if this is possible.  And you're down. 
[03:14:00]  Atoms are crammed and shoved completely under the seat in front of you, leaving absolutely  no rope, your knees, or feet.  As you know, there's no smoking, no whining, no complaining.  Fuck yeah!  Please and thank you, and you are such a good-looking flight attendant flight.  Smoky has never allowed a board of Southwestern because Smoky in the lavatory at the time for  that's $2,000, and if you wanted to pay that for your airfare, you should have closed somebody  else.  Lariat.  If we do make you that nervous the next hour and a half, you're more than welcome to  step outside.  We don't discriminate at Southwestern.  We have a special smoking section just for you.  We're going to show you a movie tonight we have up in the air. 
[03:14:30]  And the flight attendant is smoking, and it's windy, and her motto is, if you can light it,  you can smoke it.  Coming along, we've been tampering with disabled and destroying any smoke detector or  webcam.  We've got laboratories.  Federal aviation regulation of power passengers are compliance with a lot of passengers re-inflammation  plans and positive lighters.  Basically, just do what we say and nobody gets hurt.  And although we've never anticipated a lot of the cabin pressure, if we did, we certainly  wouldn't be at work tonight.  But if needed, for us, your mask is off the compartment overhead.  Stop screaming.  Let go of your neighbor.  Pull under that plastic tubing as fully extended. 
[03:15:00]  Place the mask over your nose and mouth and read normally.  To activate the wall locks, simply insert 75 cents for the first minute and take it to  the screen.  Pause.  I can't even listen to this.  Fucking hilarious.  It's so disrespectful.  It just makes...  We just live in a different world, man.  Because look at all the people.  They're enjoying it.  They're loving it.  They're all happy.  They're enjoying it.  They're absolutely enjoying it.  Except one guy, he's just kind of folding his arms.  We're cynical.  Those are a plane full of people not being cynical, just enjoying her banter.  Right. 
[03:15:30]  I want to grab her tits and just scream the C word over and over.  I don't find...  If I was on that plane, you know how mad I'd get at the...  I don't know.  I'd probably be more at the people than her.  You would actually get mad?  I'd be like, whatever.  No, I'd get mad.  You would actually...  Why?  I would probably go...  I would probably heckle her or go...  But why would you get mad?  Because...  I would get mad.  I'd get mad at the people for laughing.  No.  Because you can't even put into words how disrespectful...  Yes, you can.  That's your job.  Okay?  Calm down.  You make a living doing that. 
[03:16:00]  It's so disrespectful.  The audience...  Like, the tweets.  Better than a comedy club.  Really?  What comedy clubs do you go to?  You know what I mean?  Like...  Probably some in Maine next week.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know.  It's the people.  It's just like when you're in a club working and the middle acts...  And they're horrible and the fucking crowd like them.  And then...  Now you go up hating the crowd already.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How many times have you dealt with that with the fucking headliner?  Oh, boy.  Three in a row. 
[03:16:30]  Woo!  I'll tell you.  There's a hat trick right there.  Okay.  Grandpa Lewis' hair just got me three in a row.  Shut the fuck up, stupid.  He's growing his hair a little bit.  What's wrong with that?  He's growing it in.  Why don't you support your friends?  Huh?  Why don't you support them a little bit?  It looks like a fucking Chia pet with AIDS.  That was very hurtful.  That was awful.  It was bad.  It was terrible.  It was just hurtful.  Yes, it was.  I'm telling you.  I didn't like your fucking AIDS joke.  She would have never done that bit.  No.  She works clean.  She works clean.  She doesn't need your potty mouth. 
[03:17:00]  I know.  Clean with a slight edge.  I know.  I know.  Fucking Brenda Regan.  That stunk.  I laughed.  I laughed because it was just me.  I have a problem with her old lady elbows.  I like her tits, though.  But the elbows always give it away.  Ah, she's the...  I hate this...  Fuck.  I'm not flying.  Let's try to get to the end of this.  But they're loving it.  That's what I don't understand.  I'm trying to figure out today.  People are that easily amused.  I guess if you're on a plane, you're really nervous to begin with.  We all hate flying.  I guess if you understand.  Most of us, anyway.  So if something like that's going on, I can see where maybe it's a little bit of a relief. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, you're like, ah.  You know, oh, okay.  It's not a relief.  They're taking off.  You're miserable.  You're tired.  The last thing you want to hear is fucking this bitch's fucking routine.  Is she going to get in trouble for doing this?  Are you kidding me?  The pilots here, she's doing no.  No way.  No way.  Are you kidding me?  Who filmed her?  What are you kidding me?  The improvs are going to headline her.  All right.  Let's get to the end of this.  All of that plastic bag made on.  It's like you are receiving lots and lots of jam. 
[03:18:00]  And if you're traveling with small children, we're sorry.  If you're traveling with more than one child, pick out the one that you think might have  the most earning potential down the road.  And if you're traveling with somebody needing very special assistance, like your husband,  bless the start, or your wife, put on your vest first.  That's it for the news and don'ts of show and tell.  Sit back and relax.  Or you can sit up and be tense.  See the way.  So that's all it.  Game to game, the clock's already ticking.  Seriously, if there's anything at all that we can do to make your flight more enjoyable, 
[03:18:30]  please tell us just as soon as we land in Salt Lake City.  And if there's anything you can do to make our flight more enjoyable, we'll tell you  that you.  We'll sign in Southwest.  That's what we call very cheap entertainment.  Nobody had to pay extra, but you certainly don't get a refund.  That's safe.  Thank you.  And Southwest.  Welcome to the party.  I'm fucking crying.  It takes balls, though.  It takes balls to just do that.  Well, if she did, she had them.  I'd really like her. 
[03:19:00]  This guy's going to explain.  Okay, cool.  This guy's going to explain to us why.  I already know why.  That worked.  Marty on Long Island.  Marty.  Yep.  How you doing?  Why did that work?  By the way, I do have to say it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It wasn't as bad.  I thought it was going to be completely over-the-top hacky.  She had a good rhythm to it.  She had confidence.  That's kind of why I hated her.  Is that?  Yeah.  She's done that a thousand times.  That's not her first time. 
[03:19:30]  Shut up.  She's obviously got the routine down.  Right.  She worked on that a lot.  Anyway, go ahead, Marty.  Well, it's comedy out of place.  You know, you don't go on a flight expecting to hear a comedy show.  Look who she's catering to with a bunch of nervous old biddies probably going to Florida.  No.  They were going to Salt Lake City, as she just said at the end.  And they were young.  And there was not only that, I even saw a black lady laughing at this.  She's probably laughing at the white people. 
[03:20:00]  Right.  All right.  You like to Marty?  Not particularly.  Good.  But you understand why others would.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  If I'm on a plane, I'll give a chuckle.  You have to look at those tits.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be bothered by it, but I wouldn't be laughing like they were.  Let's say hi to Lenny in Toronto.  Lenny.  How you doing, guys?  All right, Lenny.  Rich.  Rich.  Do you realize?  I was just driving.  I had to call in. 
[03:20:30]  You're saying that you're insulted as a comedian at what she's doing.  No, it's just...  That's true.  You don't.  Yes, but what I'm saying is comedy.  Listen, listen.  One of the responses was, it's better than a comedy club.  So this is the mentality.  People think that anybody can do comedy.  You're on a plane.  You're about to eat stale food.  She's being funny.  No one's like, well, she should host the next Late Show.  No, you're wrong.  You're stupid.  You're wrong.  Because people, you don't know how people look at comedy. 
[03:21:00]  Stop.  This is my business.  No, this is my business.  People look at comedy like it's one of the most least respected art forms  in the business.  I'm telling you.  No, it doesn't.  You're wrong.  And people think, oh, hey, Frank down at the docks can do comedy.  Look, this lady on the plane could do it.  Anybody could do it.  But we don't know.  We don't know.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We don't know her background.  Maybe she is a stand-up comic.  Maybe she goes to open mics or something in these cities. 
[03:21:30]  I don't know.  Then she's obviously not a good one if she's still a flight attendant.  Well, she pulled it off there.  She got 5 million views.  Okay.  Do you have any videos with 5 million views?  Yeah, I had one.  They took it down.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  She has a context for what she's doing, and she has an audience that can't go anywhere.  Yeah.  She's talking about oxygen masks and flight doors.  She can't take that on the road.  That's true.  Yes.  No, that's not true, because people can turn that into material.  I would love to know if she's a stand-up on the side trying to make it. 
[03:22:00]  What do you do for a living, sir?  I'm not trying to argue with you.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, you kind of are right.  What do you do for a living?  I'm in sales, but on the side, I do comedy like everyone else.  Oh, so you get it.  You're a comedian.  He gets it.  He does comedy on the side.  That's very funny.  Jimmy.  Hmm?  Is Jimmy there?  Yes, sir.  Jimmy, when are you coming back to Toronto?  I thought you got to get back here, man.  We miss you.  Thank you.  Maybe for the next Dark Comedy Festival next year or something.  I don't know.  Why don't you do a Canadian tour?  A few of the guys are doing that, and they were pretty successful with it. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  That'd be kind of cool.  I know.  I can't, though, because I'm here.  Louie's here twice a year.  All right.  All right, sir.  All right.  All right.  Louie doesn't need our help.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Well, let me say hi to Steve in Colorado.  They're very angry with Rich Voss right now.  Yeah, don't give a fuck.  Very angry.  I think I've changed my tune on her.  I think she's trying to be a stand-up.  No, she's not.  I don't think she's doing what you're saying.  She's got the chops.  She's got the chops, the rhythm, a few jokes that work. 
[03:23:00]  All right, let her follow a fucking middle act that does backflips.  A good presence.  Shut up.  You don't, you don't, it's like these horrible.  I bet you it comes out that she's just.  You know what?  You do a whole fucking month in October on bad fucking, on horrible fucking.  Yeah, but this is different.  No, it isn't different.  It's not harmless.  It's harmless.  Don't try to go fuck yourself.  She stinks.  I bet she's going to come out that she actually does stand-up on the side.  I've heard other Southwestern, Illinois, employees do this.  Yeah.  She's trying to, you know, she's trying to make something of it.  No, it's Southwestern.  And you watch now. 
[03:23:30]  She's going to be on either Fallon or Ellen or Kimmel.  One of them is going to grab her immediately.  When this video hit?  Like yesterday?  Two days ago, maybe.  She'll be on a late night show either tonight or tomorrow.  You watch it.  It just demeans the art form of comedy.  So, you know what?  She's doing a crowd that can't go anywhere that is just horrible.  Shut up.  What if you have a call that want to say someone's mad, right?  What I'm saying is she's got a.  Steve in Colorado.  Hold on.  You deal with Steve.  Go ahead. 
[03:24:00]  It's just, let's go after it.  Steve A.  Rich.  Yes.  Why do you got to make everything about you?  No, it's about everything.  Shut the fuck up, jerk off.  It's about what I do for a living.  No, it's not about me.  It's about what I do for a living.  I said I watch this.  Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  It's true.  It's not, and you know what?  Because I'm the one who lives with me.  Okay?  Rich.  Okay.  That's got to suck.  I know.  Because you're an idiot for a roommate. 
[03:24:30]  It's what?  Let me ask you.  Go ahead.  I don't think it's possible that this lady was just doing something that she has to do  every flight to try to just try to lighten the mood and make it a little easier.  Okay.  Brighten everyone's day.  You know what?  I have to do comedy every night.  I don't go on stage and paint.  She did her little stick.  Exactly.  You know what?  If I loved this, the callers would take the opposite. 
[03:25:00]  No, they wouldn't.  Listen, she liked five million views.  Did people like it?  I swear to God, I completely changed my tune.  Because I really think this is something she takes pride in and is working at.  I'm not saying she's on your level or anything like that.  No.  But I would bet money she's trying to be a stand-up on the side.  Yeah, she's got the chops.  She would love the day where she could say goodbye to being a steward.  She's an airline stewardess and does that full-time.  Okay, you know what?  When I started comedy, I didn't...  It's like you...  When do you plan on that?  I don't know.  It's like you doing a podcast. 
[03:25:30]  It's cute and all, but it's an insult to us radio guys.  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.  By the way, it's...  Huh?  No, because we don't try...  We do 20 podcasts a week.  You do one a week.  No, here's the difference.  On our podcast, we say how tough it is to do radio.  We always mention radio.  Rich, it was just a joke.  David, hold on.  David on Twitter agrees with you.  He says, I'd rather this chick than frigging Rich whining about a couple of silly jokes  on a plane.  Chill out, Voss. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, chill out, Voss.  Steve, anything else?  Rich, all I want to know is...  What?  Why can't you just let her have her fun?  That's right.  Yeah.  I didn't stop her.  I didn't stop her.  I can't have my opinion.  Listen, if Norton hated her, you'd be fucking going, you know what, Jimmy?  Johnny, shut up.  Shut up.  Don't rope me into your...  Shut up.  I don't want to hear.  I can have my opinion.  I don't like it.  I don't like...  All right.  I'm not having an opinion.  All right.  Let's move on to John in Texas.  Get somebody who agrees. 
[03:26:30]  John, I'm trying.  There is no one.  John, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  A couple of things.  You know, it sounds like me, the last coming from that plane, A, it was a captive audience,  so to speak, but it sounded like maybe a bunch of women response, and that's what it is.  Got to tell you, man, the guys were laughing right along, which was a little...  I'm not going to lie.  It was a little bothersome, but I could...  That was cute.  But I could tell that she is taking this very seriously.  Listen, you know what?  If Norton was on that plane, all you would hear from that sheet is, ugh, ugh. 
[03:27:00]  That's what you hear from my sheet now.  Listen to you.  Why do we have to be on a plane?  Exactly.  I thought she was cute.  I mean, look, whatever.  Let's say hi to Sal and Beth Page.  What's going on, guys?  Let's acknowledge Beth Page Black today, sir.  Go ahead, Sal.  I have a neighbor who's an assistant district attorney for Nassau County, and there was a  case he...  He tries to make every case funny to be appealing to the jury, and there was a case he was doing 
[03:27:30]  up by Ant Manhattan.  They robbed London jewelers, a few ethnic people, in a rented escalade.  Robbed London jewelers.  And I hadn't...  I didn't think it was funny because he would tell me all these jokes out of context.  But we were in the courtroom, and that's somewhere where you don't expect to hear something funny.  Someone take something not so seriously.  Just like an airplane.  It's a dangerous thing.  So I'm sitting there, and one of the defense attorneys go, well, it could have been different 
[03:28:00]  people.  And he looks at the jury, and he goes, what kind of people?  Driving around Manhattan in a rented escalade.  What kind of people would you expect to be in there?  And the jury looks at each other.  A bunch of white people that start laughing, and the judge is trying to get it back under  control.  And I always tell him, I go, you should be a fucking comedian.  He goes, I would suck at being a comedian.  He goes, to be a comedian, you have to be smart. 
[03:28:30]  You have to come up with shit out of context.  Like, to be a funny guy in that kind of situation, you don't have to be smart.  You can just make fun of it, because no one expects it.  Nah, she was funny, though.  I have a question.  She could be a comedian.  No, I got a question for you.  What's this guy's name?  Rob?  I think I have ADD.  No, what's your name, Rob?  What happened?  Oh, me?  Yeah, yeah.  Here's it.  When you said, okay, it's in a plane, they're a captive audience.  I'm on a plane.  Say, Rob, say you and your girl, wife, or whoever. 
[03:29:00]  Or best friend.  Or whatever.  Listen.  I want to fly.  Say you were taking a limo ride, and the fucking limo driver was telling jokes and trying  to be funny all the way on your ride.  Would that annoy you?  I'm leaving on a jet plane.  Would that annoy you?  It's a bad example.  It would annoy me, because it's a fucking limo ride.  It's not a limo pace.  She has to make those announcements. 
[03:29:30]  A limo driver doesn't have to yap at you.  That would be invasive.  The thing is, she's making a bus.  They don't make announcements on the bus other than the streets.  This is something everyone who flies hears every time.  So her putting a different twist on it is what's funny.  But she has to make those announcements.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be a limo driver.  It'd be like the on Starlady.  Right.  Well, for me, it'd be a limo driver.  It'd be a joke.  Whatever.  I just...  Yeah, you know what?  I don't like it.  All right, Sal.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  I'm the guy that obviously hates most things on this show. 
[03:30:00]  I don't mind this one.  I don't care.  Yes, you do.  I really don't.  I swear.  Well, she did a great job.  If he might be playing with you, I don't care.  I know he hates it.  I know for a fact that he hates it.  No, look at his smile.  He's lying, because if he was on that plane, I'd get it.  He's not a good actor.  Look at how serious he is.  Look at how serious he is.  I don't see any cheekiness over there.  Yes, he is lying.  There's no cheekiness.  If he was on that plane, I promise you...  Let's go to Claire in Houston.  Claire.  Claire.  Hey.  Hey, what's up? 
[03:30:30]  Hey, Claire.  Hey, Claire.  I'm driving to work.  I got it.  So here, I think...  Because I used to fly Southwest a lot, because I'm from the South.  Prove it.  Oh, I did it so much, but...  All right, you proved it.  Go ahead.  I used a bunch of suits.  One day, sat around and saw the West, and they were like, when we do this flight announcement  show, let's make it zany, because I've been on a bunch of those flights, where if someone  gets up there and says something either funny or painfully, sadly not funny, but I think 
[03:31:00]  that's something they try to encourage with their flight attendants.  Yeah, this is...  Every time I fly on the Southwest.  You think they did this on the Malaysian flight?  There was a guy...  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  Awkward.  That would work.  On the German flights, they'd be hilarious.  Yeah, I've flown Southwest, and the male guys try to do this.  The male guys?  The male attendant.  The male...  The male...  Who says the male guys?  The male guys.  It's just males and females. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, no, there is other options.  My mistake.  My bad.  All right, Claire.  It's lighthearted.  Yeah, it was lighthearted fun.  I wouldn't love this.  It didn't hurt anybody.  Yeah.  Plus, it's a crank.  How mad are you going to be when that gets her on Ellen DeGeneres or Jimmy Fallon?  Not at all.  Well, you're mad she's on the plane, but you won't be mad when she's on Ellen DeGeneres.  Shut up.  Look at the girl that sang...  See, this is what you've got to do to get on Ellen.  Get on a flight and do a little stand-up.  This is...  Besides the fact she's stealing your bit, sir. 
[03:32:00]  Absolutely.  But you're too stupid to know that.  You started this bit doing comedy in weird places.  Remember?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What I'm saying is...  He doesn't remember, does he?  Yeah, I do.  At Starbucks and at the roof...  The diner, I would do Starbucks tour.  And now I lost my train of...  You know what?  Look at the girl that did...  The black chick that did the rap about the fire, her house.  You know, do you remember that on YouTube?  It was big.  You know, and then... 
[03:32:30]  How did it go?  How are you such a bad explainer?  Because I don't remember...  How does it go?  You brought it up.  Everybody knows the black chick when her house was burning.  They did a fucking rap behind her after the fire.  She goes, oh, Lord, or oh, God, or whatever.  No.  I don't know what you mean.  She was just a regular person.  Are you talking about, oh, Lord, there was a fire?  Yeah, that one.  Yeah.  She didn't do a rap?  Well, she did whatever.  She was just talking.  Let me tell you the business.  She got an agent after that, and they were booking her in places. 
[03:33:00]  That's what happens.  I know.  So, of course, if you become a flight attendant, you'll get an agent.  Exactly.  Going back to my point, next time you're on a flight, you fly all the time, do that.  Or you say, ain't nobody got time for that.  Right.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Did you play this lady at Sweet Brown, or what was her name again?  Yeah, Sweet Brown.  Sweet Brown, right.  I remember her.  She's a fucking wall full of whores.  But you didn't even know her slug line.  This is the remix that Voss is talking about that they did.  Yeah.  44 million views. 
[03:33:30]  Jesus.  All right, now I'm mad, because I make videos.  All right, I'm with you now, finally.  What, 44 million?  44 million.  And the original one, that's just a news report, has 49 million.  Wow.  When she first realized the complex was on fire.  I got bronchitis.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
[03:34:00]  Ain't nobody got time for that.  By the way,  Boss, who is criticizing this,  is cracking up.  He's loving this.  You know, I've never heard this.  No?  I'll be clicking light, though.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that. 
[03:34:30]  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, it's a fire.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  I said, oh, Lord, Jesus, it's a fire.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. 
[03:35:00]  Nice.  44 million views.  That's great, though.  I mean, it's so funny.  She's just naturally funny.  There are people that are just naturally funny. 
[03:35:30]  I don't know if she can translate that to stand-up.  No, it's great.  She's naturally funny.  No, she was just, you know, I remember that news clip.  She was just describing something.  She wasn't even trying to be funny.  So what's wrong with her getting famous, though?  Stop, stop.  First of all, all she did was say, hey, my God, the people that cut that and made that.  We understand.  We don't think that she did that in the rehearsal studio.  The original clip has 49 million of her just being herself.  Oh, it does, right?  Yes.  But what I'm saying is, it's you're taking somebody just because they got that many hits  and you turn them into a... 
[03:36:00]  It's just a whole entertainment game.  But you're saying that he ain't got time for that.  The other guy I think is hilarious, too.  Hold on.  Who's hilarious?  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Let me explain something to you.  You don't say it.  If you've got a video on YouTube that gets 49 million views of you being yourself, people  are, of course, going to look at that and go, wow, she has an audience.  We can make money off that.  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  We're full of...  What's wrong with that?  People don't click videos to the tune of 49 million unless it's interesting to them.  That's right, Rich. 
[03:36:30]  I mean, people used to get deals because they were good on TV.  That's right.  Now people watch the internet.  Hunk of shit.  The other guy's hilarious.  Hilarious.  The one guy that...  I'm going to make a shirt.  Hilarious.  He's looking at the fucking car.  You know who I'm talking about?  No.  You're the worst explainer, like Jimmy said.  But you don't even give us enough to even try to figure it out for you.  The car, what?  Well, he's looking at...  He says, what's his catchphrase?  You don't say?  I don't know what his catchphrase is. 
[03:37:00]  You don't say.  No, no.  There's a lot of people with catchphrases out there, so we still don't know what he's going  with this.  This guy is so funny on the internet.  How do you know it's funny?  You can't even explain it.  These people shouldn't be famous.  No, I'm saying that.  Oh, that's so fucking funny.  No, he could be funny.  What's the car guy?  No, he just...  Bob Rub?  Boop, boop.  No.  Don't help him out.  No, I guess I don't remember.  But you brought it up.  Oh, he's a goofy white guy. 
[03:37:30]  He plays a character.  What was the catchphrase?  I don't remember it.  There's not a lot of goofy white guys on YouTube, so...  Oh, come on.  Someone knows.  One of your listeners knows.  Car guy that's a goofy...  No, he's got a car guy.  He's looking at a car.  He goes, oh, would you look at that?  That guy.  What?  You know what I'm talking about?  You never heard him?  You never see...  That's what he says.  Would you look at that?  I'm trying to find this video with all the info that Rich just gave us.  Would you look at that?  He'll come right up.  Which one is it?  It's right there.  Would you look at this car?  Oh, this is so funny.  I don't know if I've seen this one.  You've never seen this one? 
[03:38:00]  I've never seen this one.  Viral videos with Rich Voss.  It's from three years ago.  Yeah, watch this.  I don't know if I noticed that.  Oh, look at that.  What are you, wiping the windows?  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  That's nice and shiny.  It's a 78.  Yeah, it's looking good.  It looks really good.  Yeah, it's got original paint, too.  Yeah.  People doing this thing before me must have put the thing away,  and it's Long Island, New York garage every day of its life.  Oh, go figure.  Look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Got it for 700 bucks.  It's real clean.  It can work on it.  But it's, whatever, the things are not packed. 
[03:38:30]  It's just like chipped.  Right, right, right, right.  There's still a lot of room to work on, so with that consideration, you know, I'll go.  You'll still do it.  Park that 700.  Park that 700.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Look at that.  You know, when I see a car like this, first thing I do is I say, would you look at that?  You know what I mean?  Oh, would you look at that?  Yeah, well.  Would you look at that?  Yeah, there's a few more blemishes on the car.  Oh, my gosh.  Just look at it.  The car is not perfect.  Just look at it.  Just look at it. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, well.  What the heck is that?  Oh, look at it.  You got me running all around the car.  Yeah, the only thing.  Oh, would you look at that?  Just look at that.  I can't pull it out either.  I'd have to drill it.  Would you just look at it?  Yeah, it's sad.  It's the only mark on the car.  I mean, just look at it.  Yeah.  I mean, just get a look at that.  A cop did that.  A cop.  Oh, where is he?  I'd like to look at him.  They told me we're not required to post warnings here in New Jersey.  Oh, would you look at that? 
[03:39:30]  Listen, I got pulled over in Jersey twice for not wearing a seatbelt in the passenger seat.  Oh, yeah.  In the passenger seat.  Oh, really?  They got a $40 ticket.  I said, would you look at that?  The way they didn't get that tax space to generate.  Would you look at it?  I was so mad.  Basically, they got to earn their money the whole time.  Yeah.  Whenever a cop writes you out a ticket, the first thing you do is you take the ticket and you say,  would you look at this?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, well, if I'd have done that, the cop did it and I wasn't there that night.  Yeah.  You should have said, look at this, and that would have probably got you off if you told him to look at it. 
[03:40:00]  Well, here's the thing.  Yeah.  I went over there the first time to fight it.  Yeah, you got to look at it.  And the cop wasn't there.  Right.  Because he had to look at it at first.  He didn't show up.  Yeah, because he had to look at it.  He had to look at it.  You know what the judge did?  He probably told him to look at it.  He probably had to look at it and say, look at that.  And I asked him the second time.  This just proves that people are so self-absorbed.  And then he said, look at it.  This guy doesn't notice this guy's doing this to him.  I asked the cop, where were you the last time?  The last time he said, look at this. 
[03:40:30]  My guess is.  He probably did that.  Oh, would you look at that?  Oh, would you look at that?  Oh, would you look at that?  What an idiot.  Would you look at this?  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I'd have to drill it out.  I've tried getting under here.  Oh, would you look at that?  You got under?  Yeah, look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  And if you tell that to the cop, we're not going to give you any considerate.  Oh, look at that.  You got to look at it this way, okay?  You just got to look at it.  That's all you can do anymore.  Yeah, I looked at it as right, and I see, you know. 
[03:41:00]  How many hits did he get?  He finally looked at it.  18 million for that.  You know what, Rich?  Thank you.  I've never seen that.  I love it.  I got a video that's like that, but it's like, check this out.  That's something Chip could easily do.  Yeah.  How fucking funny is it?  There's a concept there, and it's very funny.  I've been on a flight with that stewardess a few times.  Mike says in Miami, she's been doing this routine for years.  Yeah, she's good.  So someone finally taped her.  I used to work for Southwest and know for a fact they would let him do a set while a flight boarded. 
[03:41:30]  Then they'd put it on their website.  You should do that, Rich.  Yeah.  Rich, you're bashing your entire, wait, basing.  All right, hold on.  Dutch, Colorado.  Go ahead.  Rich, do you realize you're basing your entire argument off of one YouTube comment?  You're saying it's disrespectful towards comedy?  No, stop, stop.  It's the audience laughing at her like they think they're in a comedy club.  It's just some fucking horror.  They're laughing because they're there, you stupid old fucker. 
[03:42:00]  No, you look at me, you fucking idiot.  I've been in places where people try to be funny because I'm there.  It doesn't make me laugh.  Shut up.  You're just the average Joe that should be on that plane.  Fuck you.  Fuck yourself and get on the plane and laugh.  All right?  That's all.  Don't tell me.  Don't do that, man.  Okay.  All right.  Let's say hi to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Hey, guys.  First of all, I just want to pass along my sympathies on Otto, man.  That's tough.  You're not happy about that.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  I'm going to miss that chuckle of his. 
[03:42:30]  Right on, Larry.  I just want to tell boss not to be so insecure.  I'm not insecure.  Oh, wow.  Stop it.  I'm very secure what I do.  What I do, I do well.  Wow.  What I do, I do well.  And I've been doing it.  Stop.  I've been doing it for 30 years.  There's nothing you can say that would make me like this.  Okay?  Dude, you're a brilliant comedian.  Norton's obviously at the top of the game.  But, you know, that material she was saying in the comedy club would be one or two at best.  But on a plane, it's passable. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, we understand.  It's not worth it.  And I know you're saying, and I know you're offended by her or other people saying, oh, she can do comedy.  That's like me saying that I could be a cook.  And I'm a four-star chef.  All right.  We've got to cut this topic off because we've got a big star outside the studio.  Thank you, Larry.  And in the studio.  And someone else says, Chris, the teacher who calls a lot, he says, you have to realize that like this woman,  most of the people in that world are happy, unlike all of us.  Oh, shit. 
[03:43:30]  What happened?  Okay.  What happened?  Holy fuck.  What?  He's from Law and Order.  No shit he is.  He's coming in with Dean Norris.  Yeah, let's go.  Oh, you just talked to him, didn't you, Sam?  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah.  I met him at the Leary Roast.  It's about time you do our show, sir.  Come on in, guys.  How are you going?  Dang, dang.  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  Holy crap.  Nice little surprise today. 
[03:44:00]  Hey, come on in a little.  There you go.  What the?  How are you doing, brother?  Really good.  You look thinner than you were on the show.  Are you thinner?  I am thinner.  How much did you lose?  213 pounds.  Oh, that looks right.  Yeah.  You guys are in a movie together, right?  Hello.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know, I got to say, I had never seen, when you came in last time, I had not seen Breaking  Bad.  Oh, yeah?  I had not seen it.  Yeah.  I finally watched the series.  You're awesome.  Oh, thanks, man.  Fucking awesome.  Oh, thank you.  When you were in last time, you just made believe you were awesome. 
[03:44:30]  No, but I didn't see it yet.  I was an actor, but I had never seen that series, and Anthony was an expert on it, but I finally  went through it and saw it, and you were tremendous.  Oh, thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  Are you going through withdrawals now that it's over?  You know, I think I'm past it now.  You're finally done.  Yeah.  We still got a little, you know, we're still kind of hanging out to him.  We got one more shot at the Emmys this year, because it was for the last season.  One more time to get together.  One more time to get together, yeah, and smack that thing around again.  Nice.  Yeah.  That show, I had, before I started watching, I had like 27 years sober, but I relapsed. 
[03:45:00]  That's how you know it's a good show, right?  It's a powerful show.  Yeah, it really did make getting high look fun.  It made it look fun.  Oh, yeah.  The chick with no teeth.  That really looked fun, didn't it?  Well, yeah.  In my experience, yes.  Even more fun than the girls with teeth.  So, there's one scene I can never get out of my head.  And on Oz, when you were wrestling the guy and broke his legs.  Lee Turgerson.  Yeah.  In Oz. 
[03:45:30]  It's just such a powerful fucking scene that he trusted you so much.  And boom.  That was his first mistake.  And I'm here to tell you the Gracie system of jujitsu works.  It works, huh?  All four limbs snap, like chicken bone.  How nice of them doing a series on HBO, because HBO really, I mean, they kill people off.  You never expect them to kill off.  I think HBO overall has the best series after series after series.  Yeah, but, you know, I agreed. 
[03:46:00]  And I think, you know, they were ahead of the pack.  And I think that everybody is, you know, people are catching up.  Because, you know, they're getting wise to the parameters that are acceptable.  And what people want to see, what they want to watch.  Fucking FX's.  FX's pretty.  I just binge watched Game of Thrones, man, the last month.  Yes.  Fucking awesome.  Yeah.  And that's not my kind of show, but I love it, man.  Yeah, and you know a good show will kill somebody off.  Like, any show that will kill off a person that I really like.  They have no problem doing it.  Oh, HBO loves it.  The happier that people are with you, the more likely they'll lop your head off in season two. 
[03:46:30]  Well, I mean, Game of Thrones is based on a novel.  Right.  You know.  Yeah, I think it was a true story.  If you read it, you knew.  But you had to drag your part.  I kind of knew it was made up, Rich.  And also, I've got to tell you, any producers is very happy with that new operating paradigm.  Because, you know, if you get an actor who's a pain in the balls, it's like, you know, I'm going to kill you.  Yeah.  Can I have some more money?  You're dead.  Yeah, that's got to be a real, that kind of probably evens out the actors a little bit, too, and know that they will drop you in a second. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, because in the old days, they just didn't do that, man.  You knew you were on the show forever.  Yeah.  Once you were in, you are, right?  We should say that Dean Norris and Christopher Maloney's in studio.  I don't know if we even said that.  Oh, yeah, we didn't.  We didn't?  I don't think so.  I'm Christopher Maloney.  And I'm Dean Norris.  What is the movie you guys are doing?  Small time.  Take it away, Dean.  Take it away, Dean.  We sell cars, man.  And we, well, he deals with, like, family stuff.  I just get drunk and get the kid laid.  Yeah, I get the kid.  I can send fucking hot chicks, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, and we get them laid. 
[03:47:30]  So Dean has the role of, you know, free.  Crazy uncle.  Yeah, crazy uncle, free-flowing bachelor, getting laid all the time.  I'm the sulky.  Cry baby.  Angst-ridden dad who's coming out of the room.  I don't know why I get these fucking parts.  I just saw you in a movie, and I'm trying to picture which one recently.  What was the last movie you did?  Frozen Ground I did with Nick Cage.  Get down!  Get down!  Get down!  I'd say that, I think. 
[03:48:00]  In every movie I've ever done.  What movie?  What movie, Rich?  I can't think of it.  We watched a movie every Sunday night.  Is it an old movie, a new movie?  Was it in theater?  I could tell that it was ribbiting, apparently.  It was.  It was.  It was a good movie.  Die Hard.  Great.  Die Hard?  He's not good at explaining things.  The first one?  I want this job, man.  What do you say?  Can we get around?  Yeah, you can easily.  I want to sit around and just, like, get high like you guys.  Get high with you guys and get drunk.  So you saw him in a movie, and it was good, but you don't know what the movie is.  I don't know what the movie was or what he did in it. 
[03:48:30]  I see that one saying, like, a movie, fucking ten movies.  Well, then why would you bring it up?  It's really embarrassing now, man.  You sure you're not mistaking Dean for me?  No.  Or me for Michael Chiklis.  I met you at the Dennis Leary roast years ago.  There you go.  But you, please.  No, you have no memory of him, do you?  No, none whatsoever.  I was really high at the time.  This is based on a true story, too?  Yeah.  Joel Cerno, who was the creator of 24, he was the writer-director of the movie. 
[03:49:00]  And, yeah, it was based on, you know, his dad was a salesman.  You know, carpet and wood flooring and all that stuff.  And drapes.  And when the drapes match the carpet.  Ba-dum, bang, ba-dum, ciao.  Yeah.  But it's not, yeah, so it is based on, yeah.  And his kind of relationship with his dad.  So what is it about?  It's you guys, the relationship between what?  Between them.  Go ahead.  It's actually, it's Chris's boy comes, wants to become a salesman.  And his mom.  Used car salesman.  Used car salesman. 
[03:49:30]  His mom, Chris's wife in the show, is not really happy about that.  And he comes to hang out with us for a summer to learn how to sell cars.  And it's kind of, it's a sweet movie, man.  It's kind of guys getting to know each other, kid coming of age, and all that.  Yeah.  Kid coming of age, and in the end you realize I'm kind of coming of age, and I'm moving on  with my life, because I, you know, I had a tough time getting over what my wife had done  to me, as I'm sure a lot of guys in this room are the same thing.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  What your wife did to me was. 
[03:50:00]  Oh.  So wait, so you play a used car salesman.  Did you have, did you hang out with them?  Because used car salesmen have like a really, a horrible reputation of being just disgusting.  Yeah.  Yeah, they do.  But they've got great personalities.  Yeah.  And they're snappy dressers.  We didn't get that part right.  Did you ever see used cars with Kurt Russell?  Yeah.  Wow, I can't even remember it, but yeah.  Yeah, it's from like 1979.  It's one of Jimmy's favorite movies.  It's fucking great.  You bring it up from time to time.  Occasionally I will.  Yeah.  Because it's just kind of used cars.  One of your favorite comedies, I should say. 
[03:50:30]  I think used car salesmen are so interesting.  There's such a brilliant ability you have to be able to do to rope people in who are already  skeptical.  Because nobody walks in a used car lot thinking these are going to be great, honest people.  Absolutely, yeah.  And they still get you.  And we're finally on to them.  And they still get you.  You're right.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And we have fun with that in the show.  It's really, it's, we have some good moments where we do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where we take advantage of people.  Did you hang out on used car lots and actually talk to these people and watch them work?  I didn't.  He probably did.  You did?  I went to two different ones.  And it was just interesting to see how they engage you, what their, you know, whether it's 
[03:51:00]  a hard sell, soft sell, you know, a kind of a change, you know, they come soft and then  they bring it in a little harder.  And they all had different tactics.  It was just kind of interesting whether they were the, uh, hoverers or they were more of  the, uh, let you go and, you know, you'll come to the right decision, but yeah, they  all have their own. 
[03:51:30]  What technique kind of puts you the most in all?  Like, I can't believe they, they did that.  Um, the guys who can, uh, as you said, break through the natural skepticism through and what,  how I looked at it is they were able to read me, find out what my humor was or,  what my attitude was, it's non-existent and, uh, and work with you or, you know, kind of 
[03:52:00]  morph their, um, personality to, to mime it, mimic, uh, my, my, my, I went to a lot of French  kicking in soon.  I went to a lot of French.  So what, so that was what worked was the guys that had the ability to adjust on the fly.  Like what, what was something you saw that was awful?  Like, like, why is this asshole thinking this is going to work?  There has to be something that they did that was just terrible.  Um, there, I only saw, there were two guys and it was the second guy who, uh, he, and 
[03:52:30]  this, it was like nails on a chalkboard.  He kept going, really, really?  Like, no, what's coming out of my mouth?  I don't fucking believe.  What do you mean?  Really?  The answer is yes.  I'm telling you how I feel and think about what, what's going on here.  But yeah, you know, I, I wanted to, I kept stringing them along, but he kept going, really?  Like, yeah, nah, I don't see myself in, but yeah, nah, I'm not feeling that.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah, no.  The color of the upholstery.  Really? 
[03:53:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  And, you know, he'd move me on, try and get me.  So was that, what was his end game there?  To get you to doubt yourself enough to put your trust in his hands?  Yeah, well, that's what, I felt as though he was trying to, uh, as if I was coming with  some kind of self-doubt and he, and by, because of the force of his personality, he could convince  me.  Yeah.  Make your second guess yourself.  Yes.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So then you seek counsel from him or approve.  Right.  Yes.  That he knew a better way for me than I knew. 
[03:53:30]  No, that's in a sense.  Dean, I'm telling you, it's all psychological.  Well, used cars, people buying used cars are at a different level than someone going,  to buy a new car.  A lot of them don't have good credit.  They don't.  Right.  So they're desperate.  So they're, a lot of them are going, what, if I could just get a fucking car, I'm out  of here.  And it's really nice to prey on that.  Yes.  Did you think of the movie yet?  I'm obsessed with this.  I'm just, you don't remember the movie he was in?  No, I was going to look it up.  I'll think of it when they leave him.  You should look it up. 
[03:54:00]  Let's say hi to Eric.  He wants to, actually, no.  Let's go to Matt.  Fuck you, Eric.  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Dean, yeah, man.  I really just want to hear you say, my name is A-Sack Schrader.  How about if I just cut it short and say, go fuck yourself?  He's done with that.  Done.  We got a used car salesman on the line. 
[03:54:30]  Pete, Connecticut.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, first off, what the fuck is Rich Vos' problem this morning?  Holy shit.  Shut up.  You asked these two guys.  Yeah, you guys walked in.  It got a little weird just before you walked in.  You guys are two accomplished actors.  If you got on a plane and two flight attendants started doing a scene together, would you fucking  go, this is ridiculous?  It depends on the scene, brother.  I mean, if it was from Oz, I'd say more.  It didn't mean more. 
[03:55:00]  If they were the USAir tweet, then they were doing that.  Hey.  With a little...  There's a viral video where the flight attendant did stand-up, and these guys are very, very  good at that.  And they're offended?  Are you offended by it?  So he's very annoyed by it.  Yeah, I hear you.  I hear you.  People lay out things.  No, I hear you.  And it demeans what I do for a living.  Right, I hear you.  Exactly, and there's nothing a comedian hates more than joy being spread.  Shut up, you fucking bright-eyed douchebag.  I'm a happy person.  I like to spread happiness. 
[03:55:30]  I hear you.  I hear you.  It's fucking degrading.  You got Dean Norris on your side, Rich.  I hear you, man.  Pete, you got to figure out the whole story.  Basically, I hear you.  Pete?  All right, first off, hey, I'm a car salesman, and I love car salesman movies, so I feel like  this is a tribute to my craft.  Hell yeah.  And what a craft it is.  It's one of the hardest fucking jobs in the world.  Absolutely.  So explain some of the stuff Christopher was saying.  Well, I mean, first off, it is like...  Really?  Really? 
[03:56:00]  Really?  Yeah, that whole really thing that he was explaining.  All right, if you say so.  Really?  I missed the really thing.  I must have been on hold.  Oh, you missed it.  Okay, I know.  Yeah, I was on hold.  I'm sorry.  But, wait, I know...  All right, hold on, Pete.  Let's go with this.  What's your game when someone comes onto the lot?  You tailor it to the customer.  If I have somebody who's skittish, I'm like, I'm Mr. Sensitive.  I'm the nicest fucking guy in the world.  Oh, you have all the space in the world. 
[03:56:30]  If I get an asshole who's like, fuck you, you don't know what you're talking about, I  give it right back to him.  Fuck you, buddy.  And that's the way it works.  You've got to find what works with everybody.  You're a fucking psychologist.  Yeah, I guess the interesting thing is, I bet you how many used car salesmen go into  it going, you know what?  I'm going to be honest.  Yeah.  I'm going to take the honest.  I'm going to give the customer honesty.  And then after making no commission for four months, you begin to tell...  You're not a lot like a motherfucker.  Yeah.  Do you prejudge ups?  Like, do you prejudge the guys that walk on lots, or do you'll take anybody? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, you know what?  A lot of people that I work with will not take, for example, Chinese people.  Yes.  Hard to deal with.  Why?  Hard to deal with.  Why?  You could give them the best fucking deal right off the bat, and they're still going  to negotiate.  They won't, unless you, like, insult them, and it's so fucked up, but unless you, like,  insult them or piss them off, they're not going to buy off you. 
[03:57:30]  All right.  Who's the easiest, Mark?  You love old folks.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  What a terrible...  Oh, my God.  What a terrible pensioner.  I'm going for the pensioners.  Walk in with a walker.  Thank you, Madoff.  Yeah, exactly.  We all have old folks in our families.  Number one, they have all the time in the world.  They're not rushing you.  That's true.  They're not telling you, hurry up.  I got ten fucking minutes.  I got three fucking kids in the car.  I haven't fucking got laid in two weeks. 
[03:58:00]  You know what I'm saying?  They don't give a fuck.  My depends of phone.  It's the only thing that they need to worry about.  Is there a changing station in that bathroom?  Is there a changing station in the backseat of the car?  Well, we did ask him, though, who are the best marks, and he just answered honestly.  Old people.  It's old people because they're the best.  They got money.  They just want...  They want somebody...  Their grandkids won't talk to them.  Their kids won't talk to them.  They just want somebody to fucking talk to them.  They want to buy a car.  And look, you know, look.  It's a service business. 
[03:58:30]  I mean, it's not like he's ripping them off.  It's just like, you know, you want a car?  I'll sell you a car.  How do you sleep at night, sir?  Exactly.  How do you live with yourself?  With the money he made off the old fuckers.  You know what the worst is?  Whenever I lease a car, I try to sound like I know what I'm talking about so I don't get fucked.  But two or three moments in, they know I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I'll be like, you know, because I'm thinking I'm going to want to lease low mileage.  And the guys are going to go, what about the APR?  And I'm like, I don't know what that means.  And he's like, got you.  You fall apart fast, huh?  I collapse immediately.  I was in a place trying to, and I go, how much are these Audis? 
[03:59:00]  And he goes, that's a Saab.  He buys his cars online.  Yeah, eBay.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  Tell him about your cars.  I buy fucking BMWs.  That's my car.  Used online.  No, I don't.  I go to fucking Flemington.  One time years ago, when I had a lot of money, I wanted a Rolls Royce.  Yeah.  Okay?  What?  And I saw a beautiful one online.  And I was working in Florida.  It was in Florida.  I go, what the fuck? 
[03:59:30]  I'll get only 20 grand, 30 grand.  And I sent 1,000.  I got there.  And the picture was deceiving.  It wasn't quite the same.  So I got my money.  What was in the trunk again?  It was Jimmy Hoffa.  The car was in a flood.  So you could know.  And I go, what?  This car was in a flood?  He goes, no.  There's sauerkraut and kibashi in the trunk.  So the guy put the sauerkraut and kibashi tank, and I didn't know the difference between  a flood and kibashi.  Who carries sauerkraut and kibashi in a Rolls Royce?  I was trying to sell a flooded car. 
[04:00:00]  So I just got my money back.  Look, I buy golf clubs on eBay, this and that.  What's the difference?  Golf clubs in a vehicle is a great difference between buying a car and a golf club.  No, you're 100% wrong.  No, I'm not.  You guys, this is the wrongest radio show I've ever been on.  Thank you for that endorsement, my friend.  Pete, you done?  You good, Pete?  Hey, you know what?  I've got a great story to add on.  Oh, yeah.  We can't wait, Pete.  This never works out.  Go ahead, Pete.  This never works out.  No, no.  This will work out.  All right.  Let's try it. 
[04:00:30]  Go ahead, Pete.  My favorite car selling story ever.  And this will tell you, don't ever fuck with a car sale.  Fucking guy comes in.  Thought he tried to play a fucking, you know, tried to put the angle like, you know what?  You told me this vehicle had this for auctions, and you told me this vehicle had power locks.  I never told the guy the fucking vehicle had power locks.  We never promised him anything.  So now he starts making a scene, starts yelling at me in the middle of the showroom, call me a fucking liar.  So finally the point, the boss comes over and says, look, look, look. 
[04:01:00]  We're just going to pay for his power locks.  Get the fucking guy out of here.  So the next week, the guy comes in.  He's all swaggering.  Ah, fuck you.  I got you.  I got my fucking power locks.  The boss says, look, just take the guy's truck into the back and fucking just stay away from him.  So what I did, I got in his fucking truck.  He had this nice pair of leather fucking riding gloves that he used to drive around in.  I fucking jerked off in his gloves, left them on his front seat.  Wow.  All right. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  You pulled him out there.  I was about to fall asleep, and you pulled him out of your ass.  That would have been a better story if it was his hat.  But I'll still take it.  All right.  The punchline was there.  All right, Pete.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Pete.  I think we got to say goodbye to these guys.  That was a happy ending.  Wow.  You guys got an interview to do.  Yeah, we didn't know Christopher was coming in.  We only have Dean's information.  But we didn't know Dean was coming in.

Yeah, he's in the movie, baby.  Yeah.  Wait, the fat guy that rolled around with Borat?  Yeah.  Borat is in the movie.  Okay.  That's all you need to know, right?  That's a hell of a way to sell a movie.  That's right.  Yep.  Dean is also promoting Under the Dome Season 2.

Boy, this elevator sure the heck is taking quite a long time.  Ah, ha, ha.  I hope no one pushes all the buttons on the way back up.  Oh, stopping at every depth.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, this is like going up into the plane, but going down into the ocean. 
[04:09:00]  Where's the clouds and stuff?  Oh, you're funny.  Up where's the whales and the sonar a notch?  Hey, stop here.  I'm going to get off and buy some girdles.  Uh, floor five.  Shoes, hats, and gloves.  Ah, ladies' foundations and other picture postcards.  I'd love to go cave diving under there.  That's craziness.  Sure would.  Hey, cave diving, what are you doing?  Oh, let's journey to it.  Why don't they go down there and just lift it up with a bunch of ropes? 
[04:09:30]  Just pick it up.  Push it.  It's like, uh, it's underwater.  Water, everything's lighter than the water.  I'd like to stick you down there in a second.  You can bet.  Quick, get me a Benson and Hedges.  I see the core.  Where's my Chesterfields?  Quick, get me a Moor.  I see the big circle of fire.  I'm smoking.  I'd love to have a Titanic pickle sandwich.  Hold the relish, darling.  This is the last one of its kind.  I'm going to have a little bit of pickle with a side of pickle juice.  Get a starline plate.  I'm starving.

[04:10:30]  Well, it's just me.  Jimmy has to shit.  Voss is just wandering around, hoping that he gets recognized by someone.  Huh?  He's lost.  He's lost.  And Roland's patting me on the back because we took Dean Norris.  There's your update.  Yay.  And Christopher Maloney, who was very cool as well.  Yeah, I just retweeted somebody.  Dean Norris absolutely is the type of guy you'd want to go and have a couple beers with.  Yeah.  And he's not afraid to be opinionated.  You read his Twitter ever? 
[04:11:00]  No.  He just takes shots at people.  It's great.  All right, I'll follow him.  What's his Twitter?  All right.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  You shouldn't sing wah, wah, wah, wah.  After you ask questions.  It's rude.  Better than you!  Okay.  How's Sal today?  Sal's on the board for Travis.  Doing all right, Sal?  Doing good.  Roland, how about you?  I'm all right.  Doing all right.  Doing all right.  How's the Cronut guy?  I'm obsessed with him.  He's doing well.  He's introducing his new little Easter delicious treats for the holidays. 
[04:11:30]  Can you be able to buy it at CVS?  Yeah, what kind of Easter treats?  And how many is he going to make this time?  Well, these, of course, again, are a limited edition.  See, this is exactly what we were talking about earlier.  I got it done, by the way.  Everyone gets a poster who wants a poster.  And Don Wicklund is not happy about it.  It's like a little peep with caramel inside the egg.  Let me see.  But the limited edition crap sucks.  When you told Don...  Oh my God, that's fucking... 
[04:12:00]  All right, I'll say it.  It's cute.  Yeah.  It's cute.  It's cute.  I guess.  It's like caramel.  It's Dominic Ancel on Instagram.  How many is he making, though?  What?  Eight?  Probably until Easter, then that's it.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  When you told Don he was actually going to have to make all those posters, he looked  at you like the chef looks at De Niro in Casino and goes, do you have any idea how long that's  going to take?  But you didn't tell it properly. 
[04:12:30]  I went...  I went, uh-huh, you're going to have to mail out a lot of posters now.  And that's when he gave me the look.  Instead of just being nice about it.  Why would you be nice about it?  Because I'm a nice guy now.  Huh?  I'm a nice guy.  Everyone knows it.  I'm a nice guy, right, Jimmy?  Everyone knows it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say everyone knows it.  I think that's a bit of an overstatement.  Yeah.  You are a nice guy.  Your eyes got very big there, sir.  Yeah, you are.  Dominic Ancel, our Cronut pal, has a new treat for Easter.  I'm obsessed with him and the fact that he doesn't make enough for everybody. 
[04:13:00]  They're a peeps of boo, making marshmallow chicks filled with salted caramel and real  eggshells.  Well, they're probably really good.  It sounds good.  Can he bring a few by?  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow?  I don't know, because he's been so busy baking.  Don't even worry about it.  I'll go to the store and buy peeps from anywhere.  All right.  Fair enough.  Yeah, just get a bag of peeps.  Yeah, let's just do that.  Okay.  Or Friday.  I'll stop by early before I come in and pick some up.  That's if we're here for you?  Yeah.  Well, this is fucking riveting.  We're here on Friday?  Yeah, I think we're here on Friday. 
[04:13:30]  I think we're taking Monday off after Easter.  Right?  When's Easter?  Oh, this Sunday.  Jesus.  This Sunday?  Yeah.  You do Easter?  No.  For my kid.  I'm not going to...  What a terrible job you are.  What do you mean?  I buy him candy?  I buy him.  I buy her candy and stuff.  That's all right.  I made the mistake.  Voss almost said, yeah, but it was with a hooker.  Then he realized that was what I meant.  No, you're right.  You don't remember that movie? 
[04:14:00]  What movie?  You embarrass everybody.  Well, look him up on IMDb.  You embarrass everybody.  Because they don't know the relationships here.  I don't give a fuck what you think.  But why would you...  I've got to be honest.  Why would you go, wow, I just saw you in a movie?  Because you know the guy's going to go, well, which movie?  Because everyone has that ego that wants to be filled.  And then you don't even know the movie?  What part he played?  That book in a room?  Do you know what the movie was about?  Yeah, something.  Oh, my God. 
[04:14:30]  This is so frustrating.  I don't remember his name.  I was going to look him up, but I didn't want to ask him his name.  Did you see it in a movie theater?  No.  Okay.  Was it on HBO?  Which means it would be a slightly older movie.  Just look it up.  Was it on pay-per-view?  You don't even know what channel it was on, I bet.  Was it fucking sweet watch movies all the time?  Yeah, it could have been.  Oh, my God, Rich.  How do you get by in life?  What are you talking about?  The guy laughed at me three times.  And then all of a sudden, this is what's so weird about you.  Like, just general knowledge.  You're lost. 
[04:15:00]  And then you can be so quick with a line.  How do you not know the movie?  And then why would you bring it up if you weren't sure?  I thought he would know which one he just did.  But that's not how it works.  Oh, The Counselor.  The Counselor?  Yeah.  We just saw The Counselor.  Who was in The Counselor?  He.  That's the movie.  Who else was in it?  What was the movie about?  Oh, geez.  It's a big cast.  Yeah, yeah.  It was an ensemble, right?  Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz.  Yeah.  Right.  Cameron Diaz.  Who's this guy?  Javier Bardem. 
[04:15:30]  Bardain or whatever.  It's not Bardain.  It's Bardain.  Wait, wait.  What's his other movie?  He read the name.  This isn't even a photo.  Who the fuck cares?  He was big and now he's doing, you know.  Now he's just doing Brad Pitt movies.  Wow.  I swear I'd never heard of this movie.  Yeah, me neither.  Okay.  What's the other movie you do before that?  Go back.  Because you're not sure if that was the movie, right?  You just saw The Counselor?  No.  The Frozen Ground?  No.  It was The Counselor.  Oh, that was the one with Vanessa Hudgens. 
[04:16:00]  Right.  Okay.  It was The Counselor.  Patrick in New Orleans, also known as Nolens.  Yeah.  I'm working in New Orleans.  Patrick.  In June.  In June.  Hey.  In June.  If the club opens.  Hey, Paul, did you take fucking stupid pills this morning or what?  Take him and he melted him down and shot us.  Yeah.  Really?  Hey, I wanted to let you guys know, I rented a movie last night.  You remember that movie with that guy?  Thank you.  Thank you.  But he brings it up in front of the guy and then has no info about it. 
[04:16:30]  We watched a movie.  He could have, I said, what was, first of all, he doesn't have that many movies.  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  I don't like your fucking godlin' marbles.  How was it supposed to play out in your mind?  That's all I need to know.  Hey, what was the last, I saw you in your last movie and he would have said.  Oh, a movie.  No.  Okay.  I'll be him and you go, I saw you in your last movie.  Say it.  You're dumb.  I saw your last movie.  Oh, The Counselor? 
[04:17:00]  No.  No one would do that.  He was in to promote a movie.  He would say Small Time.  But his last movie, but what, how many movies has he had?  He's doing very well, this Dean Norris.  Small Time, The Counselor.  Right.  The Frozen Ground.  He's done a lot in the last year.  Yeah.  Get the Gringo.  That was 2012.  Right.  Prom.  This is all, by the way, I haven't even gone to 2011.  These are all my movies already.  You're a boob.  Whatever.  So fucking.  You're a boob.  Let me see.  I remember the scene of Christopher Maloney in Oz.  It's too late now. 
[04:17:30]  It's true.  You're a boob.  Christopher Maloney.  Oh, you did bring that up.  I'm saying his name.  We heard you.  Okay.  So let's talk about the good points.  Not the negative.  Good point.  There's one good point.  Outweighed by 400 bad ones.  You had some extremely quick lines today.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Let's talk about the fact that the guy agreed with me about the flight attendant.  He knew what I was saying.  He said he heard you.  He was politely trying to shut you up.  And then just jackass.  I'm talking to the real host.  Okay.  Don't talk to me like you're a peer. 
[04:18:00]  But that was a point that just.  Exactly.  By that he means P-I-E-R.  But that was a point that just bored everyone.  There's a point that bored everyone, though.  It really was, Rich.  Just because someone agrees with you doesn't mean it makes for good radio or anything.  Yeah.  It was what we'd call a snoozing dude.  Now you know good radio.  Oh, I hope by now.  God.  At least give me that.  Snowy in Michigan.  Snowy.  Hey.  Help me out.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This is the guy with the 141 IQ, right?  Rich Voss, yes.  It depends what site you go to. 
[04:18:30]  Exactly.  Downs.com.  Rich is a star on.  Right.  Look at this.  He told you about something.  That's not an idiot savant, isn't it?  Oh, come on.  You're fucking stammering on this one.  I know, Rich.  I'm not the professional you are.  Well, then you should be a flight attendant.  All right.  See you brought it around.  Sometimes things are quick, but just not funny.  Like, that was very quick and well thought out, and yet had no humor to it.  Snowy laughed. 
[04:19:00]  That's okay.  Snowy laughed.  That's good for Snowy.  That's good for Snowy.  Snowy in Michigan.  He's a regular.  Really?  Yeah, he is.  That's good for Snowy.  We only pick the best to be our regular.  We sure do.  Charlie in Santa Cruz.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yvonne, you just said it, too.  You just go, well, he hasn't made that many movies, so that would make it that much more  easier.  No, no, not no.  If you wait, if I'm watching 20 movies, I don't know every fucking...  I don't know every one of his movies.  Yeah, but you don't know any of them.  Now I do. 
[04:19:30]  It was the counselor.  If I see him in the hallway, I'm going to go, hey, it was the counselor.  He's right here.  I think you just want to...  Yeah, here, open the door.  Look at it.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Just run.  Just yell at me.  Dean, it was the counselor.  We finally figured it out.  It was the counselor.  Now they're shaking hands.  Yeah, Dean's just uncomfortable.  He wants Voss in this stupid 1920s hat to leave him alone.  Look, now Voss is walking down the hall with him like they're now pals.  Yeah, Rich, he doesn't want you to go with him.  He's on my side. 
[04:20:00]  He's not on your side.  We just broke it down how embarrassing that was.  He just goes, fuck those stortuses.  Okay, he knows.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, thank you, Dean.  Thank you.  Small time.  Go see it.  There you go.  But did you just see what he did?  What?  They just had a moment.  So then you start walking with him?  Where were you going to go?  Exactly.  You go to the hotel and have orange juice?  I was talking to a pal of mine.  Exactly.  No, the last time, the guy from Breaking Bad, who was the co-star? 
[04:20:30]  The young kid?  I'm not helping you.  Aaron Paul.  Aaron Paul.  You know, bitch.  When he was in here, we had so much fun.  He was great.  He hasn't come back.  I don't know why.  I saw him in a restaurant in L.A. with Jonathan.  He had a really good time with us.  And he came over and spoke to me.  He was like, hey, man.  He's a really nice guy.  Yeah, we like him.  A lot of fun.  The whole cast has been in.  And every one of them was nice.  And I really regret not having seen that show before they were all in.  Yeah, it's all good.  No, but I would love to have told them how great.  All of them are phenomenal actors. 
[04:21:00]  Hey, we got a question for you coming in, Rich.  Sure.  Here we go.  All right.  No, it's good.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Now, Voss is a funny fuck.  I've seen him in New Brunswick.  Absolutely.  No one will deny that, by the way.  Don't be confused ever by that.  Yeah, Voss is a hilarious fuck.  Fourth CD coming out.  Can you tell that joke about the guy with the thing?  It was hilarious.  Can you tell it?  Oh, yeah.  This dude, right?  He had this thing, right?  How would you take his bomb and make it a worse bomb? 
[04:21:30]  Easily.  He just bombed on the phone.  I know.  You helped him.  All right, quit standing like you're in an art gallery.  I am.  I'm looking at a fucking drawing of shit.  I was looking at Rich.  Do you see that fucking piece of art?  Which one?  That sold for $44 million?  Yes, I did.  Which one?  No.  Here we go again.  I'm going to tell you right now.  All right.  It was a piece of canvas painted blue with a white line down the middle.  $44 million. 
[04:22:00]  What's the name of the piece?  White line?  What's the road?  Ping pong table?  No.  That was somebody else's tweet.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, but what the fuck?  I'm not calling it.  I'm just taking it.  You can't just take someone's tweet.  Oh, shut up.  I just said it wasn't mine.  All right, where is it?  I got to see this.  $44 million fucking dollars.  You got the name of it, Sam?  I.  Oh, my God.  Another dead end. 
[04:22:30]  $44 million painting.  I looked at $44 million art.  You know what?  It could have been on one of those fake websites.  No, it wasn't.  It was on MSN.  Could someone help me out with this?  I need to know before we get out of here.  It was on the front page of MSN.  I think I got it over here.  It's.  You got it?  Where's the site?  What site?  It's 22words.com.  Barnett Newman.  Yeah.  There it is.  Okay.  Did it really sell for $44 million?  $43.8 million.  Wow.  Canvas painted blue.  Hold on.  Go back up, Sam, for a sec.  A canvas painted blue with a white line sells for nearly $44 million. 
[04:23:00]  Why?  Could someone explain this?  To be fair.  Did they explain it in the article?  Yeah, it's a big canvas.  So?  It's like over six feet tall.  But why?  I could have done that painting.  Why didn't you?  I would have sold it for half.  But what are they saying about it?  It's just.  Read the description, Sam.  Did you read it?  Yeah, it's why I don't like.  I like Rockwell.  I don't like modern art.  It's not a.  I understand the colors are really beautiful, but it's.  I don't believe it. 
[04:23:30]  Yeah, but isn't that from.  Isn't that from a paint can, though?  He didn't make up the color blue.  Newman overwhelms and seduces the viewer with.  That's a fact.  It wasn't a joke.  Don't look at me like that.  With the totality of its sensual, cascading washes.  It's just from a can?  No.  It came in a Ziploc.  I swear it wasn't a joke.  No, it really wasn't.  That's a good question.  I carry it in a cloth baggie. 
[04:24:00]  What, Sam?  Newman overwhelms and seduces the viewer with the totality of its sensual, cascading washes  of vibrant blue, coexisting with Newman's vertical sign of the human presence, his iconic and  revolutionary zip.  But there's blue in the white line.  He couldn't even get that right.  It's not even a neat line.  He can't even...  I don't get it.  I so don't get it.  $44 million fucking dollars.  And people are starving all over the world. 
[04:24:30]  He painted it in...  Thanks, Nana.  I wouldn't even put that in my home for free.  What are you doing, Dad?  Oh, my God.  He painted this painting in 1953, right?  This says it's not to be confused with his later work from 19...  Oh, his earlier work from 1951, which is a slightly longer canvas.  Version of that?  Yeah.  It's painted blue with a white stripe down the middle.  Oh, my God.  I gotta get a big canvas.  That is weird.  And a bigger shirt.  His shirt's a little tidy, huh? 
[04:25:00]  I'm a small guy.  Anthony in Jersey.  Uh, I was supposed to call.  I was at home for this show with these two guys and this comedian and some cackling buffoon.  We all know who we're talking about there, don't we?  Oh, God.  I can't remember who I was supposed to be on the phone with.  Fuck.  Really?  I fucking carried the show today.  Shut your mouth.  See, but he's going with your bed.  Yeah, he is.  Did you understand that?  I wouldn't say he carried the show. 
[04:25:30]  Did you understand he was being vague?  Destroyed.  No, I know, but they're making fun of me.  Not really.  Yeah.  I mean, you're a comedian.  You should be used to people making fun of you.  No, really?  Really?  Stinging comeback.  All right, let's go to that one.  I guess people will walk up to Dennis and start looking in their mouth and working on their teeth.  John in Arkansas.  That's a good answer.  Okay, I thought you said Dennis, though, is the problem.  You did say Dennis.  You said Dennis.  Yeah, okay.  We know a guy named Dennis. 
[04:26:00]  How did you give him this much power in this room?  I'm just saying what it sounded like.  I don't know, because we just gave up.  It was so easy for him to march in and just take over.  Believe me.  I know what the game plan is.  He was bringing in pies from his mom.  They're trying to squeeze me out, and he thinks he's going to fucking zip on in here.  You got another thing.  They pulled me out of here screaming and dead.  We just gave up.  We're like the French.  Just let him fucking come in.  Let's say hi to John in Arkansas. 
[04:26:30]  Hi, John.  Hey there, Opie.  Hey, buddy.  We may have a new Rich Voss word.  Yeah, someone ripped down our list, by the way.  Where is our list of Rich Voss words?  I want that list back.  Eric said like two years ago he was reprinting it.  Well, he's busy.  No, it was up there.  It's been up there since.  He's been busy.  Go ahead, John.  What do you got?  A new word?  A new word.  After his big moment with the actor there, he came back in the studio and said,  Stortus.  What the hell is a Stortus?  Could you find that sound really fast?  We missed that one. 
[04:27:00]  Who were those two actors that were in here?  Christopher Maloney and the guy from Breaking Bad.  All right.  Dean.  Yeah.  Dean Withers.  I don't know.  Dean Withers.  We should plug.  Rich is going to be where this weekend, buddy?  I lost my paper.  Okay.  Well, I'll be at Caroline's the 24th through 27th.  And the Opie and Anthony 20th anniversary, Ron Bennington is interviewing the guys on  All of us, Jimmy.  Including Jim Norton.  Yeah, but it's really about the ONA 20th anniversary. 
[04:27:30]  Which you're part of, obviously.  I am.  Yes.  A big part.  Tomorrow at Caroline's.  I know.  It's overwhelming to me that I've been here for 14 years.  And the audience.  See?  Don't say anything else because leave on a high note.  That was really good.  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, you can do your plugs, though.  Go ahead.  Tomorrow, Bridge Street Live in Connecticut, Thursday night, Friday, Smitty's Cinema Pub,  Sanford, Maine, Saturday, Manchester, New Hampshire, Millie's Tavern.  Millie's.  Then, Monday through this Sunday, Brad Garrett's Comedy Club at the MGM Grand in Vegas. 
[04:28:00]  Go to my website, Ridgefoss.com.  And I am going to help you out.  One of the few podcasts I still listen to regularly.  Thank you.  My Wife Hates Man.  Yes.  It's very, very good.  I mean, it's very unique and different.  Thank you.  I need a name.  I need it.  And we have a podcast.  Yeah.  We have to promote.  You guys are always in the top fucking 20.  I know.  We know that.  I'm just trying to be nice.  We know that.  And this one's got a lot of Otto, right?  It's over two hours, and it's a look back at Otto from Otto and George, of course. 
[04:28:30]  It's Ron Bennington's brilliant unmasked of Otto Peterson.  And then I think his last appearance on our show.  And then a bunch of other highlights over the years from our show.  So go get that on iTunes today.  And he was in the New York Times.  I cannot believe he's dead.  It still has not really hit home.  It's like, because even though Patrice was a big one for me, probably the biggest one  I've ever had in my life.  That was a tough one.  But Otto was a part of my life longer and my career longer. 
[04:29:00]  I just became closer to Patrice because we did something.  But this is on that same level of, fuck, man.  It's a really hard one.  It sucks.  It's terrible.  Period.  53 years old, man.  He had years and years and years left.  It's just a shame.  Right.  Terrible, terrible shame.  Want to make it about yourself?  Go ahead, Rich.  No, I don't make it about it.  You know, look at that.  He made $500 sneakers.  Why don't you tell the story one time?  Me and Otto ate beans.  Hey, you know what?  One time, fucking me and Muhammad Atta fucking shared a hot dog. 
[04:29:30]  Shut up.  You knew Otto for over 30 years and you have one bean story.  Exactly.  One story.  That's the same story they tell on a mice and men, you fucking asshole.  And Otto and I argued over the ketchup.  Maybe that's a good opening story, but that was it.  That was your look back at Otto.  But I don't want to say...  I don't...  Rich.  You can say the drug story.  It's okay.  Rich, just kidding.  There's no reason for it.  We know you were close with Otto.  And you were great today.  He likes...  Oh, I...  I don't...  Listen, I'm not... 
[04:30:00]  You were great today.  I like it.  You were good.  I'm stuttering.  I don't...  I'm not stuttering.  What are you wearing in your sleeping bag?  I'm not stuttering.  Jesus Christ.  This is the fucking worst.  I can't do this anymore.  Yes, you can.  Well, you'd make a lot of people happy.  You could do this.  Relax.  You had a great appearance.  All right?  Thank you for having me.  I should give you the nut job.  Right, by the way.  It was perfect for you.  That was funny.  Yeah, I liked it.  Tied in a pop culture movie, you know? 
[04:30:30]  With your nuttiness?  Is this already out?  I didn't see this one in theaters, so...  I got the nut job Blu-ray from somebody today.  Thank you.  And then I got Ride Along, which I never saw.  And neither did the public.  It made like over $100 million.  It made $133.  I'm thinking the other one.  It made really rich.  It made $133.  A two-person cop buddy movie.  Ice Cube and Kevin Hart.  Kevin Hart is going to be a star for a long fucking time. 
[04:31:00]  Absolutely.  Because Kevin's movies make money.  Someone's on the hotline.  We've got to go, though.  Yes.  We have to go.  We have to go.  Who's this?  Oh, it's Bob Levy.  I just wanted to tell you about...  It must have been Bob.  Bob got disconnected.  Bob, I don't know what happened.  Call back.  Yeah, he's gone.  I don't know what happened.  All right.  He knows. 
[04:31:30]  He's cool.  I got to piss and shit.  Yeah, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Thanks for checking us out today.  I appreciate it.  And I think we've got all the plugs in.  Oh, Jim Norton, Caroline's next week.  I did.  Yeah, thanks.  Okay, we did that.  We did it all then.  Go get the Otto and George podcast.  All right.  Bye.

[04:37:00]  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Of course, the minute we start, Denny walks in here.  And he starts looking around the room.  And then he sees the box of posters.  Sal, you would have loved it.  What happened?  Oh, these are some nice posters you got here.  Some nice posters.  Hey, how many of these did you get made?  I saw him, like, fishing around the studio, you know? 
[04:37:30]  Where he just kind of, like, circles around and around and around just to get noticed.  What kind of stuff you guys got in here?  Like, what does Denny have to do on this side of the building at, you know, 1030 every day?  You know, this is what Sal got mad at you about before.  Scouting around and trying to get free stuff.  Didn't I just bring you something to help you out?  Something?  Yeah, I'm just saying.  This is show prep, and then I was leaving, and then I saw the poster.  I said, how many did you get made of these?  As a joke, because that was...  And the implication being...  Well, I'll get one.  You will. 
[04:38:00]  You're confident in that.  Of course.  Oh, I see.  Go with your bumper sticker collection and all that?  Exactly.  Put it in the radio room.  You think Opie and Anthony were a little harsh on the posters today?  I thought it was funny.  You did?  Yeah.  I'm still getting tweets from the first hour of the show this morning.  People asking me to please send them a poster.  I think that's good.  I mean, he wants to take care of the fans.  We don't have that many posters.  We'll get more.  We'll get more.  Who's we?  What's we?  The company.  The company will get more.  You are not going to have anything to do with it? 
[04:38:30]  The company will get more.  They'll get more.  That's the pronoun.  They'll.  We.  We.  We indeed.  Sal, can I hear what today's line of the day was?  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Oh, I love this.  Why did you fart? 
[04:39:00]  Farting.  That cum's got to go somewhere.  That cum's got to go somewhere.  I can't believe your mouth isn't behind me.  Oh, God.  Damn.  That's a twofer.  Sal, that was all you, huh?  Yeah, that was a twofer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You like that?  Love that.  I love when Rich is in.  He's great.  I meant cum.  Oh, that too.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Rich was good today.  Did you like Rich today, Dennis?  I like Rich Voss.  He's a nice guy.  He was funny.  He is.  He was very funny today.  He's always funny.  And we were a little short staffed today because Ant wasn't here. 
[04:39:30]  I'd say Voss picked up the slack a little bit.  You have a very deep bench.  That's right.  Yeah, very deep bench.  Always ready to put somebody in, aren't we?  Yes, you are.  That's too bad for you, though.  I'm sure you're sitting in the back going, maybe today's the day.  Nope.  I know Mars is.  Mars likes it when one of the guys is out because maybe he can get in there and get some time for himself.  You know what I mean?  I'm just happy to back you up when you need me to help out on the pre or post show.  Well, you've done great.  I mean, I still receive rave reviews from the times that you've hosted the pre and post show.  Are you excited as a radio nerd about the big unmask that's happening? 
[04:40:00]  Yeah, I can't wait.  Yeah.  Look who's out there.  Oh.  Who's that?  I can't tell.  Oh, it's Susan Lucci.  There you go.  Television's Susan Lucci.  Susan Lucci.  You're not going to go out there and ask her for a photo?  From Long Island.  You're not going to go out there and ask her for a photo?  No.  Go out there and ask her for a photo and tell her you're also from Long Island.  No.  Why not?  No, because you'll get the talent department mad at me.  I want to see it happen, though.  I've never actually seen it.  Like, everybody talks about the fact that you harass celebrities all the time. 
[04:40:30]  I don't harass them.  I saw Bobby Bacalai out there.  Yeah.  Then you should just go be like, oh, we're both Italian.  Hey, can we get a photo?  Sal, you have no idea.  Denny goes, hey, are you interviewing Steve Sharipa later today?  I go, yeah, I'm taping an interview with him.  He goes, oh, what time?  And I told him what time.  And you know what Dennis said?  I swear, you didn't have this conversation with him.  No, no, no.  This is, I just saw him outside.  He goes, yeah, my cousin Steve.  Oh, my God.  I go, what do you mean you're cousins?  He goes, well, we're both Italian.  It's a Paisan thing.  He literally said we're both Italian, just like you thought. 
[04:41:00]  Do you even know what Paisan means?  He's my cousin.  Oh, God.  It doesn't mean cousin, Denny.  It's a cousin.  Cousine.  Cazzo de Marigano, as we say.  Cousine.  I don't know what any of that stuff, any of that stuff means.  You're not going to try to get Susan Lucci?  No.  No, the reason I was excited about Steve is because he's in, he's got a small part in  the upcoming movie, Jersey Boys.  It's all about Jersey with you.  It's summer.  It's about the four seasons.  Oh, oh.  Winter, fall, summer, spring?  No.  No.  The group.  Oh, oh, oh.  My mistake.  Lou, speaking of Jersey. 
[04:41:30]  Lou in Jersey, welcome to the post show.  Good morning, Sammy and Mr. Dennis Falcone.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm doing good, sir.  But I called it just because I wanted to defend Rich Voss when he was going on about  the flight attendant.  That must have been infuriating for those people.  I mean, and you really, it's the art of comedy that doesn't get the respect.  And I would have been grinding my teeth on that flight if I heard that stewardess.  Yeah, but you know what the real art of comedy was?  Watching the entire room and every caller argue with Rich Voss. 
[04:42:00]  Everybody turned on him and just decided to take the side of the stewardess for no reason  at all.  So, you don't have any clips of that, do you, Sal?  I'm sorry, what was that clip?  The Rich Voss arguing about the stewardess clip?  I do not.  I don't know if anybody pulled it or not.  They do call them flight attendants these days.  Who does?  The public.  Not me.  The companies.  Not me.  I call them stewards and stewardesses.  Sam, actually, I found one.  It was my clip of the day.  Okay, let's hear what Lou was talking about a little bit.  You would actually get mad? 
[04:42:30]  I'd be like, whatever.  No, I'd get mad.  You would actually, why?  I would probably go, I would probably heckle her or go.  But why would you get mad?  Because it, I would get mad at the people for laughing.  No, because you can't even put into words how disrespectful comedy.  Yes, you can.  That's your job.  Okay?  Calm down.  You make a living doing that.  It's so disrespectful.  It, the audience, like, the tweets, better than a comedy club.  Really?  What comedy clubs do you go to?  You know what I mean?  Like, every little script.  Probably some in Maine next week. 
[04:43:00]  Yeah.  No.  I don't know.  It's the people.  It's just like when you're in a club working and the middle acts on and they're horrible  and the fucking crowd like them.  And then, now you go up hating the crowd already.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How many times have you dealt with that with the fucking headliner?  Oh, boy.  Three in a row.  Boom.  I'll tell you, there's a hat trick right there.  Okay, Grandpa Lewis hair just got me three in a row.  Shut the fuck up, Scoopit.  He's growing his hair in a little bit.  He's growing it in. 
[04:43:30]  He's growing it in.  Why don't you support your friends?  Huh?  Why don't you support them a little bit?  It's not the only harm we are.  It looks like a bad fucking chia pet with AIDS.  I just loved it.  Everything.  No matter what Voss said, whether it was smart or dumb, everybody in the room had to have  a problem with it.  No matter what he said, it was just, let's pick on Voss day.  And I'm going to tell you, nobody can handle that the way Voss did.  I mean, you saw him swinging back.  He was swinging back.  The whole room could be against him.  And he will swing at everybody. 
[04:44:00]  The part I liked is just how Jimmy was just so on the side of the flight attendant.  And if you listen to that clip in the very beginning, he goes, I would have been mad.  Yeah.  But then once he saw Voss get all wound up, he goes, actually, she was fine.  Yeah, that was nice.  She didn't sit on the flight.  What are you going to do?  She was saying something.  It's not that bad at all.  Pretty girl.  Yeah.  And then the fact that Voss has to take a second to think, so he responds in the affirmative  no matter what gets said.  Like, Jim just insulted him.  And Voss goes, yeah.  And it was like, you just agreed with what Jim said. 
[04:44:30]  Let's go to Greg in Florida.  What's up, Greg?  Hey, what's up?  Young Sam, the future king of radio.  That's right.  Hey, Denny, how are you?  How are you, sir?  How are you?  Good.  Very good.  You should be the most annoying guy in radio, Denny.  You know that?  Thank you.  And Voss, holy shit, I mean, he's great, but do you think he knows how to get a not  Sam t-shirt?  All right, Greg.  You snuck one in again.  I should have known. 
[04:45:00]  9-1-4 did not look like a Florida area code to me, you goddamn prankster.  Love ya.  I'll talk to you later.  No, 9-1-4 is Westchester.  Oh, I know.  Denny, let me tell you something, Denny.  You can walk around here like you're the king of radio.  You can walk around here like you've been in the business for years, and you have lessons  to teach young people like Sal.  Not at all.  But I'm going to tell you something right now.  There's not one thing, one thing, that you can teach me about Westchester that I don't  already know, okay?  You're looking at Mr. Westchester, okay? 
[04:45:30]  And I don't ever want you to forget that.  You understand me?  All right.  I got you.  All right.  Now, if you want to teach Sal a lesson or two, I recommend that.  I took advice from Sal.  He knows it all, huh?  Sal was great, Sal.  He helped me out a lot.  With what?  We were working on the show.  What show?  The post show.  When I was doing the post show.  And he picked out some stuff, and he said, hey, Denny, could you work on this?  Do this?  I said, sure, sure.  I didn't blow him off.  Next day, he said, you know what?  That was nice.  You came and you applied it.  If only Sal had the same attitude as you, huh?  The team thing.  Denny did a good job. 
[04:46:00]  He definitely has improved tremendously.  Do you think you have anything to learn from Denny?  No.  You see?  That's the attitude.  He's honest.  Yeah.  Do you think you might have something to learn from Sal?  Sure.  Do you think you have maybe something to learn from everybody?  Of course.  We're all learning every day.  Except for Sal.  He has nothing to learn from you.  What are you going to do?  You can't make everybody happy.  Oh, it's not no disrespectful punk.  That's what he said.  And I don't mean to say punk baby.  I know that's a sensitive term.  It's a funny term, though.  It is a funny term. 
[04:46:30]  Izzo in Jersey.  Hey, Sam.  How are you doing?  Good.  Being that you're the now executive producer of the show, I was just curious with the timing  of tomorrow's Unmess.  A little inconvenient for some people.  I don't have XM in my car.  I have it in my truck.  Right.  So will the Unmess be replayed at any point over the weekend, perhaps on the podcast or  anything?  Yes.  I mean, we'll see about the podcast.  Maybe, maybe not.  But it will definitely be replayed over the weekend. 
[04:47:00]  And it may be replayed day of tomorrow, but it will definitely be replayed in the time  slot that's normally best of the week on the weekends here on this channel this weekend.  And it'll be on demand.  So if you have the app, you'll be able to scroll through that app as soon as it's done  and listen to it whenever you want.  So that's the joyous thing about living in 2014.  Hey, Sal, did Eric have a clip today?  Yes, he did.  I'd love to hear it.  Why are you still rubbing your tattoos with that shit? 
[04:47:30]  I have a new one.  Yeah.  Oh, you did get another new one?  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's see.  It's a dunce hat.  Jesus Christ.  I can't see, Rich.  Okay.  It's a little boat.  Huh?  What is it?  The fucking Amistad tattooed on your fucking form?  What is it?  I'll be working in a month.  That was funny.  It was.  I mean, and that's what I mean.  They're slamming his tattoo and he's got one better.  He's got one up.  And now, a lot of times that comes back to bite Voss in the ass because sometimes he 
[04:48:00]  comes for the one up and it's not quite as strong as he thought it was.  But he's very genuine.  I mean, he was still upset about the flight attendant in the restroom.  He was.  I was walking out and I said, oh, I was on Southwest about a month ago.  Can you believe it?  You know, people come and they degrade us.  They think we're, you know, it's tough what a stand-up does.  And he's bringing it up with Dean Norris and Chris Maloney.  Like, hey, wait till you guys see this clip.  And they're like, we're just here to talk about our movie.  That'd be like used car salesmen being mad at Christopher Maloney and Dean Norris for 
[04:48:30]  portraying them in a film.  What do you know about selling used cars?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Steve, Steve in Florida.  You're on the post show.  I've been on several flights with that flight attendant on Southwest.  I had a job.  I had a travel office.  And she's great.  I mean, she's a great flight attendant.  And not only that, it's a pretty interesting way of capturing everyone's attention when you  do a safety check.  If you think about it, nobody pays attention on a safety check.  So does she have the same routine every time?  I've been going, I've been flying for about seven years. 
[04:49:00]  And I just have to answer.  I mean, she flies all over the place.  And I run into her.  I mean, there's other flight attendant on Southwest.  But does that shake like you've, you've, you've been flying with her for years.  Does she always have the same routine?  No, she mixes it up.  The reason I knew it was her, because she pulled the line about passing oxygen to the  kid that can have the most potential.  I'm like, oh my God, that's her.  Yeah.  And wow, she mixes it up.  You got to give respect, right, Dennis?  Yeah.  She might go on like some smaller airlines and work in some new material. 
[04:49:30]  Like she just goes to like small, small clubs and just tries to...  Like she gets on the prop planes and just tries to work out what she's got going on.  Yeah.  That's a funny concept.  Peter in Texas.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How you doing?  Just wondering if you saw the Iron Sheep's tweet to Nancy Grace this weekend that just  happened.  What exactly did it say?  Nancy Grace, you dumb fat bitch.  I beat the fuck out of you.  If you talk about my wrestling brother, go fuck yourself, you dead dog whore. 
[04:50:00]  And that's when the Iron Sheep was in here last week or the week before, that's what he  and his handlers were talking about.  That he can, under that name, you can tweet really whatever you want.  And it's going to be okay.  I don't think there's anybody else in the public.  I mean, he's got 500,000 followers.  Nobody else with those kind of numbers, who's a man, can threaten to beat the fuck out of  Nancy Grace, quite literally.  Right.  I don't think so.  That's the beauty of being the Iron Sheep, though, I guess. 
[04:50:30]  Did you enjoy the Iron Sheep when he was in here?  He was very entertaining.  He was.  He was very entertaining.  Well, Dennis, before we go, I need to ask you a question.  Yes.  Who is the only woman in your life to wipe your mouth and wipe your tears all in the same  five minutes?  Who was it, Dennis?  As Connie Francis would say, mom.  No, I was thinking of your therapist.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  You were right.  It's your mother.  Your mom deserves a really great gift for Mother's Day. 
[04:51:00]  And Steven Singer Jewelers has the perfect solution.  Exclusive gifts that are going to last a lifetime, and they're just for mom.  Check out Steven Singer's famous Real Roses, lavishly and deeply dipped in 24-karat pure  gold.  Dennis, you've seen those before.  They're beautiful.  They're stunning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're stunning.  You've got to view.  As a matter of fact, last time Steven Singer was in here, you tried to mooch a couple  off of them.  No, he gave me one, and I said, can I get another one?  I have, you know.  This is the only rose.  It's the reason Dennis likes it. 
[04:51:30]  It's the only rose guaranteed to last a lifetime.  For the first time, Steven has introduced his exclusive Mother's Day gold-dipped rose  in the hottest new color, Radiant Orchid.

A punctuator.  That's right.  Jeff in Philly.  Samuel, how you doing, sweetie?  Good.  Uh, so, I have something that I want to bring up that a lot of, I'm not a hardcore ONA fan, 
[04:52:30]  I'm really not, I listen to you guys pretty casually, but a lot of the fans have a certain  disdain for Rowland.  Mm-hmm.  And, I think he gets a free pass the entire time, with all the bullshit he goes through  with the Cronut guy, the stuff he tweets Mr. Cronut, he calls E-Rock Slabo, but he's  a fucking fat pig, like, why does Rowland get a free pass?  I don't get it.  Well, a lot of people ask that question, and I think that Rowland doesn't get a free  pass, necessarily. 
[04:53:00]  I think what happens is, uh, the guys know that, like, when Opie and Anthony go on the  air, and they say something negative about a celebrity, or negative about a product,  or, and Dennis, you know more than anyone else, they do that quite frequently, yes?  Yes, they do.  Rowland, a lot of times, has to pay a penalty for that.  I think that Opie and Anthony realize the penalty that Rowland has to pay behind the scenes  so maybe, like, for Eric, you know, once the show's over, it's not like he's getting 
[04:53:30]  a hard time the rest of the day.  No, you guys still get more hard time.  Yeah, but not like, your job's in danger, a hard time.  Like, there's no publicists calling Eric.  Right.  And being like, what the fuck is going on over there?  You know, Eric doesn't have to juggle things.  He's still putting out fires, Rowland, from all this.  Exactly.  Yes.  Eric just has to be able to take his licks the way that Sal does and the way I do.  Rowland actually has to put fires out and juggle things, and I think O&A are conscious  of that, I think.  Sam, why did you take that call, dude?  It's, I swear to you, did you see what the call screener wrote? 
[04:54:00]  No, I did not see it, no.  The screen wrote, I have a super secret call that I can't tell the phone screener about.  Adrian, you screened that call, correct?  Yeah.  Did that screen say anything about Rowland on it?  No.  Did you know he was going to talk about Rowland?  Nope.  He refused to tell me, and I figured I'd give you the choice.  I just know what's going to happen.  It's going to make Rowland upset for the rest of the day.  Yeah, but I explained it.  I explained it.  I'm a Rowland supporter.  Me too, dude.  That's why I'm like, I feel bad now.  He'll be fine.  He's an adult.  He knows what the deal is.
