<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and irreverent introductions, immediately launching into a discussion of Anthony's apartment living woes, including frustrating neighbors and elevator struggles with groceries.  This transitioned into a humorous analysis of Tim Tebow's surprisingly successful Denver Broncos playoff game, focusing on the statistically improbable nature of his 316-yard passing performance.  Anthony then recounted a humorous anecdote about encountering LeBron James and Dwyane Wade at a Chris Rock and Aziz Ansari comedy show, detailing his successful attempt to obtain a photograph with LeBron. The first segment concluded with a discussion of a 60 Minutes segment on a stem cell scam,  various coincidences surrounding the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy,  critical reviews of commercials, a gruesome bungee-jumping accident, and the availability of "Moneyball" on demand.  Several unnamed individuals, including Danny and Travis (along with Travis's wife and child), were mentioned, alongside Chris Rock, Aziz Ansari, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade.

The show continued with a discussion of the movie *50/50*, including humorous alternative title suggestions, and an announcement that Dr. Robin Zasio from *Hoarders* would be a guest.  The hosts launched into a scathing critique of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's alleged entitled behavior during their daughter's hospital stay, accusing them of essentially taking over the facility.  This was followed by a running gag about a show staffer, Sam, and his small, old television, resulting from a lost bet, and an incident involving Opie's Breathe Right strip.  The hosts then engaged in a vulgar critique of Jay-Z's music and career, comparing him to Eminem and Too Short, and speculating about the occult significance of Blue Ivy's name.  They also reviewed *The Ropers* and Rob Schneider's new sitcom, "I Rob," and briefly mentioned the declining ratings of *Jersey Shore*.  The segment culminated in outrage over a Papa John's employee writing "Lady Chinky Eyes" on a pizza box, followed by the on-air destruction of Sam's television with a sledgehammer.  Upcoming guests Jim Brewer and Seth Rogen were mentioned, along with a pre-recorded "American War Stories" segment featuring Bob Kelly, and Patrice O’Neal's posthumous CD release.

The next segment focused heavily on Sam's $200 Walmart television purchase, with relentless mocking from the hosts and E-Rock, who ultimately smashed the TV on-air.  Jim Brewer then joined the show, sharing details about his life, including his family's tumultuous history, his upcoming show, and a documentary about his father.  Seth Rogen made a brief appearance, discussing his film *50/50* and Brewer's documentary.

A subsequent segment featured comedian Jimmy Norton, discussing his role in *50/50*, including Bryce Howard's performance and his emotional experience filming.  The conversation encompassed crying during movies, followed by a discussion of "Hoarders" and the appearance of Dr. Robin Zasio.  A significant portion focused on Sam's hoarding of wrestling memorabilia, exploring the psychological aspects of hoarding behavior.

The final segment highlighted Dr. Robin Zasio's expertise on hoarding, differentiating between extreme hoarding and "pack ratting."  Humorous anecdotes about personal possessions, including a host's shoe collection and bedbug concerns, were shared.  Seth Rogen discussed his Alzheimer's Association charity work, and Jim Brewer promoted his tour.  Further discussions on hoarding, the differences between collecting and hoarding, and a staff member's extensive celebrity autograph collection were included.  The possibility of Tony Iommi having cancer was briefly mentioned, followed by lighthearted banter, an awkward hug, and mention of upcoming guests and shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  You get dang over here, don't listen to the dang over here.  Stop with that shit.  I know, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww. 
[00:01:00]  Morning, everybody.  Good morning.  It's Monday, right?  It certainly is.  How's everybody?  Have a good weekend.  A good weekend, that thing that is much too short.  My God.  It was a good weekend.  It was a nice warm weekend.  It was spring in New York. 
[00:01:30]  It was nice.  Actually, barbecued Saturday.  Did you really?  I didn't.  Danny did.  That's good.  Travis was over with his lovely wife and adorable child.  And, yeah, had some of the, you know, the post-Christmas thing when you've still got presents left because you haven't seen the people on Christmas.  And then you've got to do that awkward, it's after Christmas thing.  We were on the same schedule because that's a big family Christmas party for me, too.  Yeah.  Because they all do their Christmases, and then you've got to, like, all get together still. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, and toss the gifts at each other that have been around for a while.  They start coming over to my house, they're like, where's your Christmas tree?  I said, it's January 7th, it's gone.  Mine's still up, but all the ornaments are off of it.  Yeah, but you've got a fake tree.  Yeah.  If you have a real tree, you want that shit out of your New York City apartment.  That shit gotta go.  Travis knows, he's nodding.  Those needles are a fucking pain in the ass.  And now I've got to deal with an elevator that's just covered in everyone else's needles for the next two weeks.  On the rugs. 
[00:02:30]  Because nobody cleans up after their own tree.  What's worse than somebody who leaves their shit laying around in an apartment building?  Isn't that enraging?  That's horrible.  It makes no sense.  Like, we have, just real quick, we have a basement, and we've got, you know, two shopping carts in case, you know, you come back from the grocery store and you want to unload your car.  That's convenient.  It is convenient, except for the assholes who just decide to unload their stuff in their apartment and then put the shopping cart in the elevator and just let someone else take care of it.  Oh, man.  They're just scumbags. 
[00:03:00]  Like, you can't go down, my building's six floors.  You can't go down six floors.  Anthony, you would never be able to live in a building full time.  I did.  What do you mean you did?  I was in Brooklyn for fucking time.  But I mean now.  Let me think.  That was a long time ago.  No, I'm saying I don't know if it would be any different now than it was then, because I hated it then.  Like, I went crazy in Brooklyn.  I'm like, why am I living with these people?  Yeah.  When you're living in a building in New York, you're living with people.  I didn't sign up for this shit.  The way you have to synchronize everything when you've got groceries, like, you've got to bring it from the car to inside the lobby by the elevator and make sure you bring everything there. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And then phase two is trying to get everything onto the elevator while people are waiting or fucking with the elevator.  It's a pain in the ass.  I can't wait to get a house.  I can't wait.  You guys are great.  I'm sure they're looking at me like an asshole, too, but still.  Look, I don't want them to have to deal with me, and I don't want to deal with you.  Yeah, but you're not inconsiderate to that point. 
[00:04:00]  You know what I do, though?  But my building, they're so hoity-toity.  I come and go with the service elevator.  Guess what?  It's my own private elevator.  It's nice.  It is nice.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I live pretty high, so every time I go into my elevator, I have assholes on the way down that are coming on the elevator.  Yeah.  They refuse to look at you.  They refuse to say hi.  Because, believe it or not, I try to be friendly and try to, like, say hi.  You should post pictures of yourselves or your names in it in the lobby.  No. 
[00:04:30]  Seinfeld.  First one of the day.  I'll do kiss hello.  Yeah, kiss hello.  But I go right to the service elevator, but these people like the service elevator.  Oh, my God.  That's beneath us.  My word.  We would never go back up to our apartment in the service elevator.  They bring trash in there.  Oh, yeah.  It smells a little bit, but guess what?  No one bothers me, and I go up and down.  No problem.  Nice.  Don't have to stop on anyone's floors.  That works.  It's beautiful.  Actually, the service people in the building get mad at me because they want that elevator 
[00:05:00]  because, you know, they got deliveries and takeout coming and going, and there's asshole  me using it as my own private elevator.  I like the noise factor with the house.  Like, I could be as loud as I want, and I don't have to deal with other people's shit  because when I was in Brooklyn, here's what I dealt with a lot of times.  And, of course, you run. 
[00:05:30]  Everything stops.  You turn the TV way down, and then you put your ear against the wall.  You're trying to hear what's happening, but I swear to you, and I guess it's from my upbringing,  I'd always get this, like, rush of adrenaline and just this weird, like, bad feeling.  That's awesome.  When the couple is arguing next door or above you or below you or something.  That's great, Tom.  And I never liked it very much, and that's why I like my own...  At least listening to arguing is entertaining. 
[00:06:00]  The people that live below us, their teenage daughter...  Masturbates?  Yes.  Oh, man.  She's real loud.  You know their parents aren't home.  When she's playing some rock band-type singing game.  Oh, no.  And for the last two weeks, she's just screaming that new Adele song at the top of her lungs.  That's hilarious.  Stupid Adele.  Over and over and over.  I'd knock on the door.  Hi, you want a little help with that?  I could probably coach you through. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I don't think...  Yeah.  You're much worse when you think...  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  You think no one can hear you argue?  And like, ah, no, we aren't arguing that loud.  And then you're so quiet next door and you hear...  And you're like, ah, oh, God.  You heard every word next door, Robert Reed.  In my apartment...  All right, Hurley.  In my apartment, you could only hear through the vents in the bathroom.  And we heard a little sex noise at the end.  Ah.  A little sex noise.  You sure they weren't someone taking a dump? 
[00:07:00]  That could be.  Oh, no.  They're very similar.  They're very similar.  Oh, God.  Unless the woman was having a tough time getting one out.  Oh, yeah.  I think it might have been a little sex going on.  There's some kind of club I hear in fucking, right?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, you're like...  I'll listen every time, man.  Hotel rooms.  Hotel rooms are great for that.  Because out of nowhere, you're just watching TV and you just start hearing like, am I hearing...  Is there something going on?  So you quietly just start hearing...  The beds are never good for sex in hotels. 
[00:07:30]  The headboard's hitting the wall and then you're just hearing like...  And it sucks though because it's hot when you hear the girl, but then you hear like...  Oh!  Oh!  And you're like, what's going on in mom and dad's room next door?  Yeah.  I'll listen to that sex shit every time.  No problem.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck, man.  The stupid Giants won again.  Oh?  Jimmy's even annoyed.  I just hate them.  You don't like the Giants, right?  No.  I hate them.  Falcons were never in that damn game. 
[00:08:00]  They were at the beginning when they scored two points.  Yeah, I guess.  I guess when it was 2-0, they were still in it.  Yeah.  People beat me up because I'm a Jets fan.  They're like, why aren't you going for the Giants?  That's stupid.  Why don't people understand that?  I'm a New York fan.  Do you do that shit?  Well, I'll tell you what.  If those rare instances when the Yankees are out and the Mets are in...  You're not rooting for the Mets.  Yeah.  I know you rooted one year, but that was...  I do.  But your ex was into the Mets.  Yeah, yeah.  So that had something to do with it. 
[00:08:30]  Not really.  I tell you, I would just rather go for a New York team.  It's kind of...  It's a little more fun.  Makes the games a little more exciting.  Like, what am I going to fucking...  You know...  Oh, great.  Green Bay.  Yeah.  Gives a shit.  Yeah, I'll explain why.  All right.  Being a Jets fan, people want me to be a Giants fan now to stay with the whole New York thing.  Let's say Giants win the Super Bowl.  Guess who gets beat up next year when they start playing football again?  Their wives?  Their wives? 
[00:09:00]  And all Jets fans, because now they've got bragging rights.  Well, then maybe...  All the Giants fans will now forget that maybe the Jets, you know, as a fan base, helped you  out and jumped on board.  Oh.  Next year, they beat the shit out of you.  Maybe if the Jets didn't blow it, they would be in the same boat.  All right.  Good point, sir.  So it's the fans to blame?  Well, I...  Good point, sir.  I must...  Look, I think if we had a poll, that's how most sports fans look at it.  If your New York team is out of it, you don't jump to the other New York team. 
[00:09:30]  You just don't do it.  You don't jump with the same verve that you would.  Right.  Your team.  I'm like, I'm not going to watch the Mets and, you know, know everything about the team  and really give a flying fuck if they win or lose.  Yeah.  But I'm definitely going to be like, oh, that's good.  You know, they're winning.  I can't do it, man.  Can't fucking do it.  So, I mean, right now I'm not an Islanders fan.  But, well, I was going to say when the Islanders are out of it, which they already are, I'm 
[00:10:00]  supposed to root for the Rangers.  Do you know how crazy that is?  If you're a hockey fan?  Well, that's a weird rivalry, though, that, you know, I don't know.  That's a fucking bloodthirsty rivalry.  But you should look at it all the same, man.  I don't know.  Fuck yeah.  We're fortunate to have, you know, two teams in pretty much every league.  Yeah.  But that doesn't mean you just kind of willy-nilly jump from one to the other.  You've got to have some loyalty.  Well, you don't willy-nilly.  It's just if the other team is doing really well and they're in the playoffs. 
[00:10:30]  Like, I could give a shit during regular season what the fucking Mets do.  But if they go further in the playoffs than the Yankees, then, you know, then of course  you're going to peer in on them and see what they're doing.  Why?  Why root for geography?  Like-  What else are you going to root for?  A fucking uniform, color?  But, well, no.  That's why gambling is fun.  Root for who's winning.  Because then you can-  I root-  Oh, okay.  I root for Tebow.  Yeah.  So does Jesus.  Until the Broncos are knocked out. 
[00:11:00]  And then I go 49ers to win the whole thing.  That's what I do now.  Oh, yeah?  That's my thing.  Why not?  You got a team?  You got a football team?  I'm just thinking Green Bay, but it's based on nothing.  But, you know.  They won last year, so they're good.  Yeah, yeah.  And they had a good season, so I'm just thinking.  They didn't have to squeak.  They didn't have to squeak in.  Yeah.  So, you know.  You see the Tebow.  Who didn't?  Everyone's talking about it, so what can we say here?  But that was just another unbelievable win. 
[00:11:30]  Another big win for Mr. Jesus.  Kind of unbelievable.  Jesus' chosen one.  Because at the end of regulation there, the Steelers had a chance for a nice long field goal.  Yeah.  Before Roethlisberger kind of fucked it up.  They had one more play to try to get a little closer and increase their odds.  And then it was a fumble, right, Travis?  He fumbled the ball?  Well, yeah, but he recovered.  No, I know he recovered, but he lost about 10 yards.  Lost a few yards.  And then that made it a 66-yard attempt. 
[00:12:00]  That wouldn't have been.  And they're starting to talk like, yeah, might as well go for it.  It is Denver.  But then the Steelers were like, yeah, no, we can't do that.  So then the overtime thing happened where they explained the overtime rules forever.  And then the overtime took 10 seconds.  10 seconds, 11 seconds, yeah.  What are the new rules?  I think it's if, well, obviously, if the first team scores a touchdown, the game's over.  If the team scores a field goal, then the other team gets the ball. 
[00:12:30]  They get one shot at it, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  But what if they turn around and then score a touchdown?  I don't know.  And I guess they win.  This is the first.  But that's not fair because you were the first to score.  Yeah, but you scored with a shitty field goal.  Well, that's basically what the NFL is saying is a shitty field goal.  We all know that just sucks.  It was always, if you got into field goal range, you won the game.  Well, yeah, and that's why they changed it.  Yeah.  All you got to do is get down to, like, the 40-yard line.  Right.  You both have to touch the ball once, right?  Unless the team scores a touchdown like Tebow did. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  Then the game's over.  I like that, though, because one guy runs it back.  That is kind of good.  Yeah.  Yeah, you have to get a touchdown.  It's a little harder to do than a field goal.  Yeah.  Why is that, though?  Like, why is it if he scores a field goal, the team gets the ball without a touchdown?  Yeah, because like we just said, because they realize how stupid it is to win on a dumb  field goal.  Yeah, because if you kick off and you get the ball to, like, the 30, then you've really  only got, like, you know, 40 yards left to go, and then you can just be lazy and kick  a field goal.  The object of the game isn't to do anything.  The object of the game at that point is to get your team to, you know, the 35-yard line. 
[00:13:30]  It's stupid.  But, you know what, I think of more commercials that way, the more, the more, all the time.  Each team must possess or have the opportunity to possess the ball unless the team that has  the ball first scores a touchdown.  Yes.  Play continues in sudden death until a winner is determined and the game automatically ends  upon any score.  Or when a score is awarded by the referee for a palpably unfair act.  Oh.  How about this?  Wow.  Overtime games, no field goals. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, really?  No field goals.  First team to score touchdown wins, that's it.  Forcing them to have to keep going instead of trying to kick the field goal.  Make it easy.  That could make for a pretty beat-up couple of teams if it goes for quite a while.  Tebow, you know, he threw the ball.  He only had 10 completions, by the way, so let's all calm down.  He had 10 completions for 316 yards.  That's the weird part of the whole thing.  And Tebow.  316 yards.  And Tebow loves 316. 
[00:14:30]  He loves it.  Oh, yeah.  And he throws for 316 yards yesterday.  That's just fucked up, dude.  It really is.  It's starting to get creepy.  Tebow, 316.  Yeah, we get it.  But do you understand?  316?  I know.  It's odd.  That pass in overtime was the one that won the game and also gave him a perfect 316.  316.  316.  I don't know.  It's going to be tough against the Pats, obviously. 
[00:15:00]  Tebow against Brady there again.  Yeah.  First time it didn't work out too well for the Broncos.  Well, you know, you can't count them out.  You can't count them out in any game.  Look, man, if the Broncos season ends next week, they had a hell of a fucking year, though.  An amazing year.  You know?  So, this is all just bonus time now for that franchise.  Boner time?  Boner time.  All right.  Let me.  What?  Oh.  Boner time.  Yeah.  That's what Sundays are about, eh? 
[00:15:30]  Football.  And Saturdays now.  Yeah, Saturdays and Sundays.  Thursdays, Mondays.  I didn't really give a shit about the Saturday games, really.  They weren't great.  I didn't really care.  Those two games yesterday, I watched every fucking play.  Those were two good games for me.  What I give a shit about.  So, the games next weekend are going to be great.  A lot of big games.  Well, they're all big games now.  True.  Ah.  True.  True that.  There you go.  That is true.  And Jimmy made me extremely jealous over the weekend. 
[00:16:00]  I finally showed it to him.  I've seen your dick.  That's old news.  I've seen your dick.  Seen your dick.  We've all seen your dick.  Yeah, the comedy seller.  Comedy seller.  Jimmy's hanging out.  And as much as I think he's a choke artist, LeBron James walked in with Dwayne Wade.  Well, it was more than we knew they were coming.  Like, what do you mean?  A lot of the guys showed up?  Yeah, I think a lot of the players.  Bosh wasn't there, but I think there was like three or four players there. 
[00:16:30]  For the Miami Heat.  Yeah.  Miami was in town to play the Nets, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they told us that they were coming in to see Aziz because one of LeBron's guys is a fan.  I don't know how it was.  So they were running late.  They had like a little area saved for them.  They didn't know who was coming in.  And I was like, I wanted to get a picture with him.  Yeah.  But I'm like, I know he's going to have people around him.  So I texted Kevin Hart, who's really good friends with everybody on that team. 
[00:17:00]  I said, I'm going to use your name to shamelessly get a photo with LeBron.  And he wrote me back that he was going to tell him, you know, something stupid to tell  me to fuck myself.  Yeah.  So they come in while Chris Rock is on.  Chris Rock did like an hour.  Jesus, what a great night.  He was, yeah.  You got Chris Rock in the cellar, LeBron just hanging out upstairs.  No, he didn't hang upstairs.  It was...  Well, the picture's from upstairs.  It is.  So he...  They came in, they watched Chris's set, and then watched Aziz, and then the show ended.  And on the way, they came upstairs, and then were leaving. 
[00:17:30]  And as he's walking by, his guy's like, oh, you know, of course.  But I'm like, hey, I got a message from Kevin Hart, for Kevin Hart.  Something like that.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  And then he just kind of stopped, but he kept going a little bit.  I'm like, all right, I guess there's no picture.  And then he's just standing in the middle of the room like, and?  Like, do you want to take a...  Like, he kind of annoyed me.  Like, he was annoyed that I hadn't taken the photo yet.  I thought he just kept walking, and I didn't want to...  So he's standing there waiting for me to take the picture, and he was fine. 
[00:18:00]  I should have got...  Dwayne Wade, you can see he's in the back there.  There's a guy...  You can't see the...  Where's Dwayne Wade?  There's two tall guys in the back.  That...  No, to your right, Travis.  No, no, no.  You had it.  There's two guys.  Not there.  There's one more to the right.  Right there.  That's Dwayne Wade.  Really?  It's just a black shadow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  I didn't want to...  Look at how fat I look, and my sweater, it looks like I have a jizz stain on my sleeve.  It does look like you got a jizz stain.  Is it a jizz stain?  No, it's just chalk or something.  Yeah, but you did the... 
[00:18:30]  You pushed your head back because the camera was too close, because your chin doesn't look  like that usually.  It really doesn't.  Yeah, I didn't.  I just panicked, because I didn't expect to get it right there.  Fucking LeBron James, man.  Yeah, that was a good one.  If he wins a championship, that is a massive photo.  He's wearing an Adebisi hat.  I know.  I wanted to get him and Dwayne together, though.  That would have been a really cool shot.  Don't worry about it.  You and LeBron James is good enough.  That's a huge picture right there.  Fucking made me jealous when you tweeted that.  Yeah, you know me.  It's like me and the celebs just kind of...  Oh, sure.  Hanging?  Of course they want... 
[00:19:00]  But they weren't talking to anybody, really?  They were just doing...  No, they actually left right after.  They were going to hang upstairs, but I guess they were going somewhere.  They spoke to people who wanted to speak to them, but they just kind of came  up and said goodbye to Aziz and left.  Right.  But it's...  I was up there, and I'm sitting there with Sherrod Small and Chris Rock  and waiting for these guys to come upstairs.  And a fan approaches Chris, this really weird dude.  And Chris is kind of a quiet dude.  He's not, you know...  Yeah.  He's a little socially, you know.  Just kind of relaxing after the set. 
[00:19:30]  And the guy comes over and goes, hey, man.  And Chris goes, hello.  He's a little shy.  Yeah.  And the guy's like, come on, man.  Give me something.  Give me more than that.  What?  Like...  What's that mean?  I like myself so much more for the way I approach famous people.  Like, the guy wanted...  Chris, I guess, agreed him a certain way.  Ugh!  And he wasn't being...  He was just an asshole...  And that guy will never know how close he came to having Sherrod separate his jaw. 
[00:20:00]  Ha ha ha!  Yeah.  Because Sherrod was going, like, what do you want, man?  What do you want?  Uh, and the guy's like, come on.  Like, he didn't...  Wasn't understanding what...  Because, you know, Sherrod stood up.  And Sherrod's a big dude, man.  And he's a fucking...  He hits like a truck.  And the guy was just being really oddly serial killer-ish and aggressive.  Wow.  That's creepy.  Really creepy fucking fan vibe.  And, uh...  It's very rare you see a guy be that obnoxious.  And the guy didn't yell.  He wasn't...  He was just drunk. 
[00:20:30]  And he expected something from him.  And I don't know what he expected.  Right.  Uh...  Probably recognition.  Probably assumed, look, I know you.  You have to know me.  But then he's like, hey, can we take a picture?  And Chris is like, okay.  Oh, the guy's like, oh, my friend's over there.  I want you to say hello.  Say hello!  And Chris is like, oh, I'll get him on the way out.  All the features of a dickbag fan.  What a fucking douche this kid was.  Little fucking...  Little fat lips.  I still remember his little...  He looked like he was, uh... 
[00:21:00]  He was like a...  Kind of a white-Spanish combination.  I couldn't tell what nationality was.  Just a fucking creep.  I never want to give that vibe to anybody I approach.  Never.  That fucking...  Ugh.  He really gave me the creeps that did.  Yeah, what a dick.  Did anyone follow him out?  No.  I mean, because it was just rude.  And then I just...  I was talking to...  I was curious about something with shooting.  Like a technicality.  So then I just kept talking about it to try to get the guy to go away.  And then I kind of understood people who hang around someone who's being annoyed. 
[00:21:30]  Like, because you really just wanted this guy to go away.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like, yeah, I guess maybe that's how it is.  Like when you're Tom Brady and your friends are standing around and there's just people lurking all the time.  Yeah.  Maybe that's how it...  You know?  So I kind of felt a little empathy for people who had prior annoyed me.  Does that make any sense?  I hear you.  Maybe I am that guy more than I realize it.  No.  Notice no one's looking at you as you tell that story.  Yeah, maybe.  I'm just kidding.  Bob!  Not that I have that crazy energy, but maybe... 
[00:22:00]  I'm kidding.  Maybe...  Eh.  They don't know.  And they just see you standing there waiting for something.  People are just like, come on.  Yeah.  I'm changing my ways.  You should just blink a little more and then everything will be okay.  Possibly.  I look like I blend in.  Yeah, you'll blend in if you just blink a little bit.  But LeBron fucking James, dude.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I think he's a choke artist, but that's a huge picture right there.  Yeah, I was happy to get it.  He's a very tall gentleman.  He seems to be there.  Yeah, I said to him, what are you doing?  What are you shooting a bunch of hoops around or something? 
[00:22:30]  What's the weather like up there?  Yeah, I said, what are you up in the clouds bumping your head up on the planes or something?  When they fly by, you can see the pilot.  Why don't you give them a big howdy-do?  I wanted him to know that I recognized him when he was in the showroom, so I wanted to  walk in and then just wink and make the swish move with my hands so he would know that I  knew it was him.  Did he watch you perform?  No, no.  I wasn't even on that third show.  I was only on the first two, but they said he was coming in.  I'm like, I want to try to get him.  But they came in. 
[00:23:00]  There was nine people that came in at his party.  They never saved tables like that, but for him, you know.  For his party.  His party, isn't it?  And they came in.  Luckily, Chris was odd when they walked in.  They were all quiet because, you know, nobody's going to yap while Chris Rock's on stage.  Right.  But any other comic would have had a hard time.  Sure.  I was glad that I wasn't on.  Yeah.  Nah, because it would have been nine people walking in.  It's just, you can't, especially when five of them are over 11 feet tall.  I know.  That is a little rough. 
[00:23:30]  LeBron doesn't look that tall in that picture.  Well, I'm 5'11", and you can see how he just towers over.  Did he crouch down a little bit, though?  He might have.  I mean, he's in shame for me.  He's still easily.  I think he's 6'9".  I think you're about right.  But it looks, I don't know, maybe he's crouching down, or maybe you were on a footstool or something.  6'8".  6'8".  Is he only 6'8"?  Wow.  Okay.  6'8".  And Jimmy's about...  No, but I mean, even 6'9".  I guess you expect ballplayers to be like seven feet now. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Or guys like, you know, Shaq is...  Because no one has seen Shaq has gone into one of the clubs down the street, and he said  he's a massive...  Because LeBron wasn't as big as I thought he was going to be.  Like, he's a big dude, but he wasn't as wide or muscular as I thought he was going to be.  Shaq was...  7'1".  Yeah.  Shaq was on vacation the same time I was on vacation.  I told this story before.  And we're all going in the ocean, and we're way over our heads.  And he just walked in like a prehistoric dinosaur.  And he was so much further out than anyone else, and he was only up to his nipples. 
[00:24:30]  He just walks to England.  That's when I realized this fucking guy is tall.  Because you know when you're going...  You know about the area you could hang out?  Yeah, yeah.  Before the drop-off.  And he went way past that.  He was just hanging out in the ocean by himself.  Like a brontosaurus.  Yes.  That's hilarious.  That's the famous story when we had a nice suite down there in the Caribbean, and some  asshole was making a lot of noise upstairs, like really to the point where I was getting 
[00:25:00]  really pissed off, and I was going to go upstairs and say something.  And I swear to you, it turns out that's where Shaq was staying.  That was Shaq making noise.  Can you imagine?  I knock on his door.  Trotting on the floor.  To tell him to knock it off.  He would have knocked my teeth out.  I hear he's very pleasant.  He's a guy I've never met, but everyone I've ever known who's met him, or comedians I know  that know him, and all I said, he's a really sweet guy.  We saw him all week, and he's very, extremely soft-spoken.  Yeah.  Very, like, almost whispery, and just extremely nice to every single person that he came in 
[00:25:30]  contact with.  Fans, people that worked there.  He was just unbelievably nice.  I guess it's hard when-  And I never got a fucking picture, and I wanted one so bad.  When every single person, everywhere you go, knows who you are.  Maybe that's a weird pressure.  Athletes get that, maybe, not to say more than rock stars, but when you're Shaquille O'Neal,  like, you can't even blend in sitting behind somebody.  Like, even famous people can sit next to a friend and kind of just hang low, like, on  the plane or something. 
[00:26:00]  When you're 7'1", and 320, whatever, there's nowhere you can go where you just don't stick  up like a child's toy, like the head coming out of the car.  Everyone knows who you are everywhere you go.  All you're going to see today is Tebow highlights, huh?  They forgot the Giants even played yesterday at this point.  I just could care less about- Tebow, to me, is just uninteresting where- I mean, it's fun  to watch, but he's having a decent-  Why is he uninteresting?  I don't care about him at all, or the God angle.  I hate his showboating- 
[00:26:30]  Well, most people are making fun of the God angle.  Yeah.  They think it's kind of fun and funny and stuff.  I just don't like the-  It's a great story, though, because this guy, they didn't even- really don't think he  has what it takes to be an NFL quarterback, and now look what he's done.  They've now won a game in the playoffs.  I don't care if the Steelers were beat up, they still won.  Tebow won a fucking playoff game.  That's crazy.  The camera's going nuts when he takes that knee.  No, it's just-  Photographers are all just like, ah, clamoring to you.  I hate the knee.  I hate the fact that he publicly has to do that. 
[00:27:00]  It's just, to me, it's so-  He's-  Look at me.  Revering Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Yeah, but do you hate that, or do you hate the fact that everybody knows about it now?  Like, it's not like he was doing it to get attention at first.  No, no, but he was always doing it.  He did it in college, too.  Yeah, but now people are doing it to mock him, and I don't mind it, because I look at him  thinking, wow, his life's got to be pretty damn boring if he's that much into Jesus.  Now it's a mockery, but like, you know, if he's been doing it since the first game that 
[00:27:30]  he was in college when nobody knew who the fuck he was-  Yeah, I don't think he's doing it to get famous.  That quality in anybody annoys him.  He has-  It's more annoying when he brings it up.  What Travis is saying, he hasn't changed his behavior just because, you know, he's more  famous now.  Right, no, no.  He's always been this guy.  And that's just an annoying quality to me in a person.  Like, if you always have to mention your God, then to me, you have nothing interesting to  him.  I don't care.  That's what I'm saying.  Over and over.  Obsessively.  But that's what I'm saying.  That's why it doesn't bother me, because I would imagine his life is extremely boring 
[00:28:00]  when he's not playing football.  Or imagine it's extremely tortured.  You know, certain things the Bible may say are not appropriate.  Right.  Or tortured.  You're right.  Well, guess who Tebow thanked after the game?  Anybody want to guess?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Anybody want to guess?  I don't know.  Anyone?  Anyone?  You knocked out the number one defense in football and a two-time Super Bowl winning  quarterback.  What were your emotions as you completed that last pass play to Demarius Thomas?  Well, the emotions were definitely running pretty high.  And, you know, first, as I was running down the field, I just wanted to thank my Lord and 
[00:28:30]  Savior.  And then I jumped in the stands, which I'd never done before, but I was pretty excited.  And then got back on a knee and thanked the Lord again and tried to celebrate my teammates.  And what a special moment it was for us as a team, for the fans, and for our coaches  as well.  See, usually that would bother me.  It doesn't bother me at this point.  It just doesn't bother me.  I got to thank my...  Then just, who gives a fuck?  That robotic, pre-programmed response.  And before people get mad at me on Twitter, it would annoy me with any fucking religion. 
[00:29:00]  Any of them.  Ugh.  Doesn't bother me.  Oh, I want to thank my Lord.  Do you?  I think I had to thank him.  Every time.  Well, you do that.  You do that.  Well, he threw for 316 yards.  Let's not forget.  Oh, that's tremendous.  Not 315, not 317, 316.  That's cool.  Too bad I didn't throw for 420.  Then we'd know what he was doing after.  Yeah, like that matters.  And a lot of people making the jump from 10 completions to 10 commandments, Anthony. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  He completed 10 passes, which would be your 10 commandments.  Oh.  For 316 yards.  Oh.  God, religious people are silly.  That is just silly.  Stephen Hawking hasn't moved a muscle since 1940, and this, what are you thanking God  for?  Thank my Lord that I could fucking throw this hunk of fucking pigskin while the greatest  genius of our generation can't even wipe his own asshole?  Really?  Like, what are you thanking God for? 
[00:30:00]  The inconsistency?  Dummy?  Dummy?  Well, it is silly because I'm sure there were some Jesus people on the other side, and  they didn't get their wish yesterday.  That's why I always thought that is just dumb.  Dumb stuff.  The smartest guy on earth is trapped in a living.  He responds with his right cheek.  That's all he can move.  Is that what he's down to?  Yeah.  You sure?  Yes.  I heard he can't even do that.  No, he can twitch his right cheek.  Oh, okay.  And his 70th birthday, he can't even.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, goodness.  But it's good that God's looking out for Tim Tebow, traipsing up and down the field.  Touchdown!  Touchdown!  Completion!  Fumble!  Good.  That's God.  He's got his priorities straight.  Good.  I got to tell you, they got to move 60 minutes.  See, you didn't watch the game, right?  No.  Everyone was, like, over-the-top excited.  Tebow wins in overtime.  Shortest overtime ever in dramatic fashion.  And everyone just has this adrenaline rush.  And they didn't have time for the post-game show because they were over. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So they go right to 60 minutes.  And it's this depressing stem cell story about this kid that has, what, cerebral palsy?  And his parents are going to this doctor, believing that the doctor could help him, but he's a scam.  Oh, no.  Oh, is that what the scam artist was?  Yeah.  And you're just looking at your TV like, what the fuck happened?  We were just having a good time.  I didn't even look to see what channel I changed it to.  I just changed it.  Get rid of it.  I watched that after football.  But they do it every Sunday. 
[00:31:30]  Every time.  It's always a depressing story.  A lot of times these games end up in an exciting way, in an exciting fashion.  And it goes right to 60 minutes, which is the biggest downer show on TV.  So what happened?  Because they showed, like, where they tell him we're 60 minutes.  What was the guy doing?  The only reason I kept it on, I couldn't find my fucking remote.  And that's the God's honest truth.  So I made about two or three minutes.  But I guess parents are in a tough spot with their kid.  He has cerebral palsy.  They basically have him, like, standing in a wheelchair.  I don't know.  Because I think he's missing legs or his legs are too short or something. 
[00:32:00]  And then this doctor is giving him hope about stem cell therapy.  And 60 Minutes secretly taped the Skype conversation to show everyone that he's a fraud.  Well, who is the guy?  What does he do?  I don't know.  I really wanted to get this show off my TV.  He's a doctor from Alabama who is the director of Stem Tech Labs of Ecuador,  which claims cures for cerebral palsy and other diseases.  But how do they know?  Why do they think it's a scam?  From Ecuador.  Yeah, because he's claiming that his stem cell research cures cerebral palsy, 
[00:32:30]  and I'm betting it doesn't.  Well, they went to experts.  He lost his license in 2005.  So how does he drive?  They did go to experts, and the experts are like,  no, stem cell therapy or whatever cannot do this yet.  So I wonder what they said to him when they confronted him.  Because they look like a cool moment, and I just forgot I had to run downtown.  Well, if you're on a Tim Tebow high, the last thing you want to do is get into a story like that.  Why? It shows you the balance of his lord.  Right. True. 
[00:33:00]  On Sunday's show, CBS got the help of a family with a child suffering cerebral palsy.  They ordered stem cells over the Internet and had them shipped to the U.S.  Then they met Eklund at a Florida hotel near home for treatment.  Oh, that sounds like a hotel.  That's good.  Yeah, it does sound legit.  He is there. He is confronted by a correspondent.  And what did he say, Eleanor?  I don't know.  That's what I want to know.  We can cut up the audio.  I'd love to know.  Let's do it.  It's Monday.  We, you know.  I want to know what the doctor says.  Just find out what the doctor said and let Jimmy know.  When the 60 Minutes people come, what does the doctor say? 
[00:33:30]  It was a fucking downer.  He's angry.  Let's go to Garbage Truck.  Garbage Truck.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Or Jim calling from his garbage truck.  What's up?  I heard Ocho Cinco sent out a tweet last night.  Isn't it weird that the names of the referees were Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?  I saw a lot of people tweeting that last night.  I just assume that can't be true.  I don't know.  I thought it was fucking weird.  That can't be true. 
[00:34:00]  And then someone else tweeted a picture over Mile High Stadium was a cloud in the shape of a halo.  Did you see that?  Oh, man.  People are just out of fucking control.  Unless the guy photoshopped it.  I saw it.  It's not even interesting if the referees' names were Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.  There's no coincidence.  He's just a guy with a fruity voice who tossed the ball to somebody and they ran.  Here you go!  And I don't hate Tebow, but it just gives a shit.  But it is a little weird that the Jesus guy throws for 316 yards. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, he shouldn't throw it.  It's weird because...  Who was the last guy to throw for 316 yards?  That'll prove how weird this is.  Well, yeah.  In a big game, a playoff game?  It's a number.  Usually you throw for more.  You gotta throw for something.  Yeah.  Look, all I'm saying, it's weird.  Do I believe in some mystical fucking numerical thing happening?  No.  Of course not.  But it is strange.  It's just weird how that works out sometimes.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's very coincidental. 
[00:35:00]  With shit.  All right, boys.  I gotta go.  I'm driving.  What about the Kennedy-Lincoln fucking thing?  I heard a lot of those are not true.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't know which ones, but I hear it's a bunch of bunk.  Like, I feel those coincidences.  Yeah.  You know, shot in the head in the theater.  I didn't.  This one, like, Tuesday.  This one worked at Ruby Tuesday.  All right, cool.  People just, you know, I heard that Lincoln enjoyed a good sandwich.  And then he went and Kennedy once said, which sand?  Oh, my God.  Well, the coincidences.  Both shot in the head? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Secretary of Lincoln?  And he drove a Kennedy?  Oh, fuck.  What does that mean?  Nothing.  And you're hearing most of this shit is not true.  Some of them are not true.  There's exaggerations.  Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln, and Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy, right?  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe a lot of them, maybe some of them are true, but.  The names Lincoln and Kennedy both have seven letters.  Oh, my God.  Oh, well, there you go.  Some of these are ridiculous.  One was a Republican, and the other was almost a Republican. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, I got it.  A twig.  Both were shot on a Friday.  Wow, that's crazy.  What are the odds of that?  One in seven.  One in seven, yes.  Hey, why are they running that Geico caveman ad over and over?  It's funny.  I thought America decided that the caveman sucks.  We all decided the caveman sucks.  Just in sitcom form.  The sitcom was a massive bomb, right?  Just in sitcom form.  Still funny in commercials.  It's not.  It's not even close to funny.  It's not funny.  So who's enjoying him walking into the locker room dressed as a cheerleader going, Brian, 
[00:36:30]  you told me.  Enough of that.  I hate all Geico commercials.  They're terrible.  They're horrible.  Gecko one's a totally pure example of how a commercial started one way, and then people  started liking something in the commercial, so they changed the whole gimmick.  Yeah.  If you remember Frasier there, he was the voice of the original Gecko.  It was fucking...  Kelsey?  Yeah, Kelsey Grammer.  And it was him bitching that he is a Gecko and don't confuse him with Geico. 
[00:37:00]  And that was the gimmick.  And then it turns out, oh, now the Gecko is all of a sudden working at Geico?  How did that happen?  That's also like the fucking, what's in your wallet, Vikings?  When that whole campaign first started, I hate it.  I hate it.  But when the campaign first started, the Vikings would be charging at you ready to kill you  because you had these horrible things on your credit card, and that was supposed to be  the pain and agony of having that credit card. 
[00:37:30]  And then when they showed it was the Capital One card, the Vikings just stopped in their  tracks, and at the last minute you didn't get killed by them.  Well, people loved the Viking thing, I guess, so they had to make the Vikings lovable and  fun so they could be around everybody, completely changing the premise of the commercial.  And little Viking kids, because we all love kids in commercials.  It's just, it's so stupid.  What's better than kids?  Viking kids.  What about Geico also has that really funny pile of money with the eyes?  Oh, that's hilarious.  That's great, right?  That's great.  Money's watching.  That's great.  I'm standing on the Brooklyn Bridge and I'm wondering. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, fucking six.  You know how many...  I got the piggy now.  Whee, whee, the pig.  The piggy's funny.  He's just having fun.  The pig.  The pig.  The pig is disturbing and frightening to me.  You know what, though?  I don't mind.  You don't mind the pig?  I don't mind the pig, if we're going to be honest.  Don't mind it.  I'm not saying I'm over the moon about it.  You know what would be a great commercial if they show some woman going, uh, you're not  covered.  You're not covered.  And the guy walks in and goes, do your insurance employ a bunch of C words like this one does? 
[00:38:30]  Well, we don't.  That's a good commercial.  We don't rape our customers.  That would make me bug that car.  That's a good commercial.  There's a little piggy.  Now they got the piggy on the zip line.  It's great.  They should show him smelling bacon and being confused by what it is and why his little  piggy's stomach is rumbling.  When are we going to go ziplining, man?  It's all the rage.  Yeah.  And I want a meeting with Bloomberg.  I know how to make money in this city.  Yeah?  I want ziplines.  Urban ziplining? 
[00:39:00]  Fucking ziplines in Times Square from building to building.  How do we get this done?  That would be pretty interesting.  You kidding?  You know how many people would zipline from building to building around Times Square?  Oh, yeah.  It would be huge.  What a great attraction that would be.  I'm going ziplining during my cruise.  But you've always been against ziplining.  Yeah.  I kind of think it's pretty cool now.  I think so, too.  I want to try it.  I'll probably do it.  I got these rad HD cameras.  Yeah.  They strap to your head and stuff.  So I'm going to take a couple of those with me. 
[00:39:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Before we finish with commercials, there is only one commercial I don't mind.  What's that?  It's the fantasy football commercial.  What?  Where, you know, you had a bad day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty fucking funny, man.  You fell.  Oh, the zipliner fell.  Jeez, with the zipline break or something?  Yeah.  Did you see that bungee cord video?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck that.  Is that from New Zealand or something?  That bitch just fell. 
[00:40:00]  I just started thinking, you know what?  Maybe I'll try this bungee cord thing.  Fuck no.  New Zealand?  I'm back.  Did she talk about what happened?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we need that clip.  I was on the bungee cord, and it snapped, and I went into the water, and I didn't know  what to do.  All right, with your dumb fucking way you talk.  I felt myself falling, and I was so happy that my husband's not a Maori, and he's not  beating me with his fist.  Watch this.  I die. 
[00:40:30]  Watch this.  It snaps.  Oh, my God.  Part of the gag.  As the cord snaps, Aaron Lyngworth plunges the remainder of the 111-  In a perfect swan dive.  Head first into the crocodile-infested Zambezi River.  Stop with the fucking meters.  Straight away, and I felt like I had been slapped all over.  All over.  With her legs still tied by the bungee cord, the Australian student was being dragged downstream 
[00:41:00]  towards the rapids.  The trailing ropes.  This is the worst possible thing.  It's like Indiana Jones in the plane.  Right.  When he gets out in the life raft and thinks it's all cool.  There was a box of HIV-AIDS vials floating in the water.  Her head banged into them as they clanked off her teeth.  Luckily, a shark ate them.  Wait, so you got the bungee cord breaking, you got crocodiles, and you got rapids headed 
[00:41:30]  toward a waterfall.  With her legs tied together.  Yes.  Is this a Bugs Bunny cartoon?  Yeah.  As she went under the boat of the Mexican drug cartel.  She was treated in Zimbabwe, then taken to South Africa.  Treated in Zimbabwe.  That's got to be nice treatment.  Exactly.  Fucking leeches and a clip removal.  Yeah.  I think it's definitely a miracle that I survived.  You think?  The company says the faulty cord has been replaced.  Oh, good.  It has been tied in a knot.  Oh, I thought, yeah, exactly. 
[00:42:00]  But Daring will be hoping this truly is a bungee.  Do you think it's slowed her down just enough before it's snapped?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, definitely.  Just enough?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Who's bungee cord?  Who's doing that bungee jumping in fucking Africa?  No way.  Doing anything in Africa?  Stop.  No fucking way.  Just collect blood diamonds and shut up.  Come home with some cash.  Legs are all tied and stuff.  Yeah.  Unless he's probably all crammed up and together.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get them pussy lips all the witch away over each other. 
[00:42:30]  I would hate that.  Yeah.  It's awful.  I'd prefer falling like that to being snapped back up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It seems a little...  No, you'd want to be...  That whole thing is just...  You'd want to bounce.  You'd want to bounce back up, Jimmy.  Not good if it snaps.  I don't want any part of that.  So...  Jeez.  I was jumping off a bungee cord and my string broke.  My string broke?  Coco.  I was being...  Then I was in the repids with my legs tied together. 
[00:43:00]  I tried to untie them.  They don't know where to put the accent.  Yeah, they really don't.  It just goes on the end, no matter what.  Yeah.  And I decided...  Oh, you're saying the words right.  Can I ask a question about a movie, Moneyball?  Right.  I spend $253 a month on cable. 
[00:43:30]  Why isn't Moneyball on demand yet?  Why are they holding that one back?  Anyone else notice this?  Is it out on DVD yet?  I think so.  No, it's not.  Sam says it's not.  When is it out on DVD?  I don't know.  It's not yet.  No, there's some kind of conspiracy thing happening with this movie and on demand with Time Warner.  It's out tomorrow.  On what?  On DVD.  So doesn't it usually go on demand before DVD?  I think I have it on flex for you.  Huh. 
[00:44:00]  But that's Fios.  I think there's something going on with that movie.  Is it on flex, too?  I'm pretty sure.  Yeah?  Well, Time Warner still doesn't have it on.  Not yet.  Still doesn't have it on.  Well, Time Warner, you get it right after WPIX New York.  Channel 11 gets it.  Exactly.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Is it on flex, too?  Moneyball going video on demand before Blu-ray release.  Oh.  Hmm.  Fios?  What?  Starting December 22nd for video on demand. 
[00:44:30]  Oh.  What?  Sorry.  Not for you.  Sorry you can't come.  Yeah, I guess we don't have it.  Why?  Time Warner.  Do we have it?  Oh, yeah.  Probably.  I'm pretty sure I saw it.  December 20th.  I'm confused.  Could you explain it like I'm a fucking child?  It's on video on demand starting December 22nd.  This is an article saying that it was being released before the Blu-ray release.  Right.  On demand.  But it never was for Time Warner.  No.  See, I knew something was going on.  So what's that about?  They probably have different on-demand companies. 
[00:45:00]  You just stick with your Time Warner.  But we spend enough on cable.  We should get everything.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  They know what's best for you.  Yeah, they know.  They know.  They know.  I'm suspicious.  I have Wameco Home Theater.  WHT.  Yes, the movie network.  Wameco Home Theater.  Wow.  That had a long-ass time ago.  Just thinking of Wameco Home Theater.  Oh, yeah.  What was the music for that?  Was there music when that would start?  WHT.  The movie network.  Do you have that?  Can we find that? 
[00:45:30]  Because I told you my first rated R movie was The Hills Have Eyes at Bill D'Angelo's  House on WHT.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I will always laugh when you use real names.  I don't know why that makes me laugh.  Well, you know, it's a real person.  Unless I'm bashing him.  It's funny.  You know his last name and everything still.  Ours was, yeah, The Last Tango in Paris.  And that was on, I think, Cinema 100.  I don't remember.  There's a promo from 1980.  Oh, 1980. 
[00:46:00]  If you're nuts about movies.  Oh, man.  You'll be nuts about WHT.  Wow.  The movie network.  Every month, mystery, action, comedy.  The greatest movies on TV, uncut and uninterrupted.  Plus, entertainment specials and exciting sporting events.  A solid month of family entertainment on WHT Subscription TV.  All for only $19.  What a month?  Call WHT now.  212-520-2700.  I wonder what's there now when you call that number. 
[00:46:30]  I know.  $19 a month in 1980.  That's a little steep, don't you think?  That was pretty steep.  But look what you were getting.  You were getting Tommy.  I saw Tommy there.  You could get that.  You could get to Goodbye Columbus.  I saw Woody Allen.  I saw Woody Allen.  And it's cheaper now.  Yeah.  I think like HBO or Showtime or whatever is like $16 a month or something.  We should break.  We got a busy show today.  We got Brewer coming in.  Brewer.  Got Seth Rogen coming in.  I saw his movie 50-50.  Holy fuck. 
[00:47:00]  I have it.  I didn't see it.  Is that movie going to get Oscar nods?  A lot of people really like it.  It's really good.  Just nods, though.  Shit was a good.  People at the Oscar going, hmm.  Yes.  They nod, then no one gets an award.  Not a comedy.  It's with that kid from Third Rock from the Sun, right?  And also 50, what was it called?  100 Days of Summer or 50 Days of Summer?  I think one of those.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Yeah, but what was the name of that movie with that chick who's now in the sitcom thing?  Help me out there. 
[00:47:30]  You didn't see this movie.  That girl with the thing?  It's kind of like one of those.  500 Days of Summer?  500 Days of Summer.  You're thinking about Zooey Deschanel?  Zooey's movie.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It was good, though.  Funny at times, but absolutely not a straight-out comedy.  93% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Really good movie.  Fuck.  And I almost...  Ron Howard's daughter was in it, too.  What?  Ron Howard's daughter was in it, too.  Oh, yeah, Bryce.  She was great in...  Bryce was great in this movie.  What was she good in that she played...  She played a real...  The Help.  In The Help, she played a cunt, too.  She was great. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, well, because she has those icy blue eyes.  Oh, she's terrific.  Yeah, Bryce was good in it.  I almost turned it off because it's a movie about cancer, and the first...  I don't know, 15 minutes, you're like, who the fuck wants to see this shit?  I'm a busy guy.  You hang in there, and it's really good.  I'll watch it.  93% on Rotten Tomatoes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's really good.  50-50 maneuvers between jokes and drama with surprising finesse.  Oh, jokes and drama together.  Yeah, the jokes are definitely there, but the drama's also there.  It's a real look at people that have cancer and how people around them make it about themselves 
[00:48:30]  and all that shit.  I wonder if 50-50 was the original title, or if it was originally called Sex to One,  Half a Dozen, The Other.  The Other?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  What's the name of that movie?  So far, we're calling it, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  And Dr. Robin, how do you say her last name?  Zazio.  Zazio will be in studio at 930.  She's the hoarder lady.  Yeah, she's good.  That enables all these fucking people. 
[00:49:00]  No, she's on hoarder.  She's one of the doctors, one of the psychologists that go in there and coddle these people.  Well, she handles them with kid gloves.  Kid gloves.  Fuck that noise.  Oh, man.  She's cool, though.  We've had her on before.  We like her.  Speaking of which, we have some hoarder audio to play next, the one you brought to our attention.  Yeah.  We're going to do that.  And quickly, we've got to talk about Beyonce and Jay-Z.  From what I'm hearing, scumbags.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scumbags.  You know, I mean, I had a kid relatively recently, and I can't imagine going through that horseshit 
[00:49:30]  like a bunch of people had to go through.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They took over the hospital, basically.  And made it like the club.  They took over the hospital, meaning if you had a kid, the same time Beyonce and Jay-Z  were having a kid, guess what?  You weren't going to see your kid.  You were shit out of luck.  You weren't allowed to see your newborn.  Sorry, I can't see your kid.  Because they are way more important than you and your kids.  Let's get some bottles over here.  We'll have the story after the break. 
[00:50:00]  It's un-fucking-believable.  At that point, you know, how about you don't use a public hospital?  Go figure something else out.  You fucking motherfuckers.  Wow, is that a bad story for them?  Not good PR.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I hope Sam brought in his stupid TV.  Sam.  You know, this morning, I was fucking taking my breathe right nostril off.  Ow.  And it was hurting me.  I'm sorry I'm very congested.  I shot aphron yesterday, so my right nostril is very leaky.  Oh.  I apologize.  And I'm depressed because, like, I'm running late, and I'm fucking, like, it's cold, and 
[00:50:30]  I can't get this thing off my nose.  It's hard in the morning.  Ow.  And it rips your skin.  Ow!  Does it really?  Oh, God, yeah.  You have to do it.  What I do is I put, like, I put water on both thumbs.  I run my water, and I go, like, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Oh, so you try to soak it up a little before you.  And I worked them towards my, then my thumbs towards the middle.  And I was like, oh, man, fuck.  And then I just started thinking about this asshole bringing his TV in, and I got happy.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're happy about that.  Sam and his TV.  There's a whole story now.  Yeah, we'll explain if you weren't listening on Friday. 
[00:51:00]  And there is, yeah, there's more to it.  More to it now.  Yeah.  I guess things built up over the weekend.  Did they?  I don't know what goes on your head.  Oh, yeah.  I've not heard.  Here's the funny part, folks.  I've not heard an update, so I'm kind of learning with the audience.  Yeah.  All right, lots to do, but first, these messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Sirius XM, this is the Opie and Anthony Show, show, show. 
[00:51:30]  He is I, and I am him.  Slim with a tilted brim or 20-inch rims.  And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all.  And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war for you.  I'm so tired of hearing any of this. 
[00:52:00]  Why?  It's not even the music.  It's just the lyrics.  They're like, yeah, all right.  Wow, he's got money.  Oh, look out.  He's got rims.  Yeah, he's got rims.  Really?  He's still fucking rapping around rims?  All right, whatever. 
[00:52:30]  I like Jay-Z.  Do you like Jay-Z?  No, he's a cunt.  I don't know much about Jay-Z, but I like.  Oh, shit, the N-word.  That's right.  No one's allowed to say that anymore.  Really?  No one.  No one's allowed to say that word, right?  No one's listening in my house.  No one's allowed to say that.  Yeah, but.  Yeah, but.  Yeah, but.  So Jay-Z and Beyonce had a kid, and the whole world had to stop. 
[00:53:00]  Especially if you were also in the hospital that she gave birth in.  Yeah.  I guess they closed up the whole joint, basically.  Yeah, at one point they closed up the whole floor they were on.  So there's this guy in the paper.  He is pissed, because I guess he had twins.  Yeah, preemie twins.  Preemie twins.  So, you know, that's a scary time for a new father.  Sure.  And mama.  And guess what?  He wasn't allowed to see him at times, because Beyonce and Jay-Z had the floor shut down.  Yeah, they're security guys who you know have to be monsters. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  With their headsets on and everything like that, and they're telling them, no, no.  And at one point they cleared out a waiting room.  Right.  Where the guy's whole family had to get up and leave.  Right.  I would have filed a complaint with the hospital and said, hey, do these people work here?  I don't know.  Because, yeah.  I would have lost my fucking mind.  And why did the hospital assume that this was okay?  Because they probably were blinded by celebrity. 
[00:54:00]  They were, right?  Mm-hmm.  To the point where they're closing down the floor?  I don't know.  Did the hospital close it down?  Or they took it upon themselves, them and their security team, to close it down?  What do you know, Sam?  They put out, like, $1.3 million to have their own, like, little wing.  And from what I heard, the reports are that they taped over all the security cameras and taped out all the windows and had everybody removed so that nobody could see what was going on.  So what happened to that guy that was also in the hospital having kids? 
[00:54:30]  They said that their security team came and removed everybody from the waiting room at various points.  The fact the hospital would allow other people waiting to have kids to be removed from the waiting room is disgusting.  Yeah, if you want to charge somebody that much money to have their own wing of the hospital, you better have two of those facilities so that everybody else can get the service.  They are due.  That's terrible.  That's horrible.  I get the hospital's point, too.  Like, look, they're dumping a million or so into renovations. 
[00:55:00]  $1.3 million.  Yeah, whatever, yeah.  All right, but fine.  Then find a place for the other people that just happen to be in the hospital having kids.  That's where the hospital fucked up.  Sure, you could take their money, but you've got to make sure other people are being taken care of.  And do they need, like—  It's a dick moved by the hospital.  You know what?  I'm more pissed at the hospital than Jay-Z and Beyoncé.  I get why Jay-Z and Beyoncé don't want to be bothered because he probably doesn't want people trying to get pictures of his baby and him while he's having a private moment.  But do they need a bulletproof door?  Or maybe—is there that much—is there anybody in rap that would shoot into a hospital to a maternity ward? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's ruthless.  They're the two biggest stars ever in hip-hop, so I mean, not really.  They had a bulletproof door.  He's not bigger than Cool Moe D.  That's crazy.  I like the Cool Moe D.  He's bigger than Cool Moe D.  No, he's not.  He's not bigger than Eminem, Jay-Z.  Yeah.  What about the motherfucking Too Short?  He's showing more records.  What about the motherfucking Too Short?  Yeah.  He's probably bigger than Too Short.  Nah, come on, son.  That's impossible.  Too Short.  Fap and Duke.  They're all bigger than Jay-Z. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  What about the Sugar Hill Gang?  Yeah.  Wonder Mike?  They sold some records.  You're right.  Wonder Mike is big.  What about Fat Freddy?  Yeah.  What about him?  He's not more famous than—he's not bigger than Eminem.  I don't think he is.  I think he's bigger than Eminem.  He hasn't sold more records.  Who has sold more hip-hop records?  Who's got bigger songs?  Who's the number one hip-hop artist of all time as far as record sales go?  Oh, it's got to be Eminem.  Or you have sold.  Snow.  DJ.  Snow?  Snow.  Yeah.  That's the only line I do.  I'm just reading.  He was a fast rapper, that guy.  Oh, wow.  Sure was. 
[00:56:30]  Well, he was basically doing reggae in patois, I think it's called.  This was actually good until the awful MC Shan rap came in.  You didn't like that?  No, it's terrible.  Word.  Word.  I like the old MTV version.  They just went right into the singing.  Cut this bass line out.  Ha-ha.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  I really want to hate this, but I still can't. 
[00:57:00]  I still enjoy it.  Don't like it?  I might download it today.  Yeah.  Ha-ha.  What's he saying? 
[00:57:30]  He's saying, basically, they pulled down his trousers and looked up his bottom in the station,  and there's an informer.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  You know, so then I miss you, me, I'll go play.  I like it.  Danny Snow has a plan.  I don't know what it is.  Gonna pour rock salt on himself or something, get all shoveled up.  Oh.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  By the way, Beyonce's girl is named Blue Ivy.  Huh?  That's a hell of a name to give a kid, huh? 
[00:58:00]  Right.  Blue Ivy.  Good one.  Blue Ivy.  Any significance in that name?  Yeah, backwards, it's like a devil's name or something.  Oh.  I think it's a devil's name backwards or something.  Right.  I don't know.  Someone help me out with that.  Levi, are you, Leviathan?  I don't know.  Oh.  There was some talk that it's some kind of devil thing.  That's not.  Put the words backwards.  No.  Everybody thinks Jay-Z's Illuminati.  Enough with that. 
[00:58:30]  He is, right?  No, he's not Illuminati.  Gotta be at this point.  He's not.  Oh, see, Travis knows.  Go ahead.  Oh, Travis.  I'm eating my muffin.  Ah.  Ooh.  Dr. Gay in the house.  Yeah.  Dr. Gay.  It's a...  To call him Dr. Gay.  That's all.  That's 2011.  Dr. Gay.  Oh, okay.  Blue for his album, The Blueprint.  And Ivy, because Beyonce's favorite number.  Why are you always looking at me with that face on me?  Not always.  No, I'm not already.  Just right now, because I don't like what you're saying. 
[00:59:00]  Beyonce's favorite number is four, Roman numeral Ivy.  Ivy.  Motherfucker.  So that's how you come up with your kid's name.  Okay, that makes sense.  What are they going to call the kid, though?  Blue?  Yeah.  Yeah, probably Blue.  Oh, that's not good.  Or probably...  If you go to school.  Blue-eye.  It's too short.  Blue-eye.  Hey, Blue.  I think Ivy.  I think if the kid, you know...  Blue's not bad, though.  Blue's actually sounds...  Yeah, the name is okay.  For a fucking dog.  They're not going to make the connection to Blow when she's in school, right?  Yeah.  Or like Blue Balls or something like that. 
[00:59:30]  Or maybe Blueberry.  How about some nicer things?  Okay.  How about Blue's Music?  It's a standalone name, really.  Oh, no.  You just didn't do that.  It's not a standalone name.  All right.  Did anybody see the thing I Twittered?  I found a live version.  Just stumbled on it on YouTube.  I don't know what I started looking for.  Oh, was that real?  Billie Holiday?  Oh, never mind.  Well, yeah.  No, the Ropers.  Oh, God, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, the Ropers.  I was watching 70.  I was watching Carter Country.  I was trying to find...  Carter Country.  Wow.  Do you remember the fucking fat sheriff?  Chief Roy Mobe, the mayor.  Handle it, Roy.  Handle it, handle it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's right.  And I was looking up characters from Carter Country.  Why would you do that?  I just remembered...  It's so weird.  I stumbled on something which had a 70s montage in it, and it had all the themes from 79.  Yeah.  And the Ropers was like...  Can you hear the Ropers theme music? 
[01:00:30]  It was terrible.  But it's so funny because Norman Fell is just dancing with a plunger.  But then there's another version...  That's longer you were tweeting?  Well, there was two versions.  One was the syndicated version.  One, Audra Lindley, was named first.  And one, Norman Fell is named first.  Oh, why is that?  That's what I don't know.  Probably.  And the dances are different.  You got to put this on so you can hear the music.  It's really good. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, I got it on over here.  Oh, uh-oh.  Wow.  People watch for this.  All right.  She's just dancing.  I would have done her.  No problem.  Audra Lindley.  But wait, Norman Fell rules.  That dumb smile.  Yeah.  Looks like a pet.  She's holding a...  He's just dancing with a plunger.  Justin Volpe.  But there's another one where he's just dancing differently.  It's a different dance and everything. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, that's the dude from...  Jeffrey Tambor, yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's where I first seen him on The Ropers.  Holy shit.  Who's this dish?  Patricia McCormack.  What a 70s sitcom name that is.  Oh, and the kid.  They got to have the kid in there.  Whatever happened to the kid?  Evan Cohen.  Evan Cohen.  Drug overdose.  Oh, boy.  It happens.  I know a guy named Evan Cohen.  He wrote a book.  Really?  Yeah, about the...  The Ropers?  No, yes.  Audra Lindley, the...  Where did this take place?  I don't remember.  I think it was...  Probably California.  California, yeah.  Looks like the California house, right? 
[01:02:00]  Same shit.  Wow.  That show didn't do well.  I loved The Ropers.  I used to enjoy that.  The Ropers?  I was young, though.  Are you kidding?  No.  I don't remember if it was going to happen.  That's where Jeffrey Tambor got turned on to.  I'll tell you this.  If you love The Ropers, you're going to love IROB.  I'm telling you right now, IROB is going to set the fucking sitcom world on fire.  What the hell's that?  You don't know what IROB is?  No.  Proven you don't watch football, sir.  Proven you do not watch football.  Oh, see?  Yeah.  Rob Schneider's new sitcom.  It looks terrific.  IROB. 
[01:02:30]  What's the name?  Robot or something?  Well, they're going, you know, iPhone.  IROB.  So, you know, that'll get the people watching.  Because we all love anything that starts with I.  Can't find any information on it there, can you?  That's not...  Probably spelling it wrong.  They're running commercials ad nauseum.  Cheek Marin's in the show.  Who?  Cheek Marin.  Cheech Marin?  Cheech.  Sorry.  Did I say Cheech?  I was like, I was trying to figure out.  I'm sitting here like, wait a minute, Cheech.  I don't know who you meant to.  And I'm looking at you like, no, I got this right. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Cheech.  Cheek and schlong.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  The music was terrible.  I know.  Well, this is, uh, IROB is going out with a girl, and guess what?  What?  The girl's family doesn't like Rob.  Uh-huh.  This is a unique situation for a sitcom.  No, it's not.  Oh.  This is an advertisement.  You guys haven't heard about IROB yet?  Merchicle.  No, not at all.  Wow.  Oh, this thing looks fucking horrendous. 
[01:03:30]  Does it look really bad?  Horrendous.  New show.  Which channel?  CBS.  CBS, right?  Yes, CBS.  And nothing on CBS has flopped.  They're doing it very well, so they're due for a bad one.  This January, the newest member of the family is a gringo.  Oh, boy.  Stop arguing.  We're not arguing.  That's just the way they talk over dinner.  Rob premieres CBS Thursday, January 12th. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, it's just Rob.  Yeah, upside down exclamation point, because it's Espanol.  Is that why they do it?  Yeah, it looks like a mortgage.  I think they're trying to get the whole iPhone fucking people.  It does look.  Okay, and I get that, though.  He's with the Spanish girl.  Yeah, they do that backwards, upside down, the question mark, at the beginning and end  of things.  It's a way to get that eye in there without getting sued.  That's what I'm thinking.  Looks good, right, Travis?  No.  No, it doesn't.  You saw the commercials.  Yes.  It looks good.  It does not look good. 
[01:04:30]  This one's going to be good.  You're wrong.  I rarely disagree with you, but you're wrong.  Rob Schneider, it looks good.  I'm telling you.  There's going to be some funny fried banana scenes, like, what are you doing with the banana?  You're not supposed to fry us?  And they're going to go, oh, you don't get it, Rob.  Oh, Rob.  You know, all the cultural differences.  Got you.  You don't like when they have cultural differences?  Oh, no.  They always fodder for good humor.  When their cultures are just a little off?  Yeah.  And they have to try to understand each other?  You don't like that?  No.  Oh, it's all I'm thinking of now. 
[01:05:00]  Why don't we play that as a bed?  I want to get my ass eaten to the Roper's theme song.  Do you have any more promos for Rob?  I'll just call it Rob, then.  Starts on Thursday, so...  To me, it's I, Rob.  Look at that.  Doesn't that look like I, Rob?  Come on.  I could see where you would think that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, I think if the exclamation point thing was even with the Rob, then maybe. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, that would be like I, Rob.  But see, they lowered it, and yeah, yeah, I saw what they did there.  They're going with the I thing.  You think?  They're trying to get into the I culture.  Yes.  Find us another promo, because they're great.  Speaking of TV shows, Jersey Shore premiered, right?  Yeah.  Ratings down 1.2 million viewers from last season.  That is what we call a uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Dunsky? 
[01:06:00]  Uh-oh.  Beginning of end?  Well, there was no big promos for anything that happened in the season.  No.  Except the fact that they came back to the Jersey Shore, I think.  Oh, really?  That's the big thing this season.  Oh.  But they filmed it a while ago, and they haven't filmed anything since then, so I think they  were ready for this to be the last one.  Yeah, yeah, they're not like...  So they all know this is it.  Back on board.  Yeah.  I think now they're trying to see what they can do.  Like, if they can spin off Pauly into a reality show about being a DJ and...  Oh, boy.  Well, yeah, like half of them already have their own deals.  Yeah, Snooki and J-Wow. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  They're all going to fail miserably.  I mean, it's about...  The nation has been desiring Snookin' for Love for a long time.  No.  Snookin' for Love.  Yeah.  No.  What is she down to, like, 98 pounds now?  She looks horrendous.  People are like, hey, she's hot now.  Oh, no, she's still not hot.  No.  Good news, Sam found another Rob.  Oh, good.  This is behind the scenes.  Oh.  What?  This is a little behind the scenes, but I like this.  Oh, ho, ho.  Let's see what this is about.  Snyder married into a Mexican-American family, and that real-life experience inspired him 
[01:07:00]  to do a comedy about the effects of culture clashing.  There's a real feeling of, you know, this could be something special here, and that's  a nice feeling.  In the show, the characters of Rob and Maggie suddenly decide to get married without telling  his soul.  If getting married impulsively was a bad idea, Vegas wouldn't have chapels open at three  o'clock in the morning.  But then.  We're going to go to my parents' house to tell them we got married.  These people, they're all Mexican.  Hi, everybody.  Oh, Fernando, pay the cab driver. 
[01:07:30]  So much for first impressions.  You know, there's a lot of Hispanic people in America, but I want the show to be for everybody.  I think it pokes fun in the best possible way.  Oh, good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  That's good to hear.  Isn't that great when you get that type of humor?  Oh, good.  Oh, I like that.  Good-naturedly good.  It pokes fun in the best possible way.  It's all fun. 
[01:08:00]  It's all fun for everyone.  No one gets hurt.  Yeah.  But you hear that line again.  And I won't talk to a lot of the promo.  Yeah.  It's a language.  It's a show to be for everybody.  I think it pokes fun in the best possible way.  Oh, good.  Oh, that's such a relief.  It's not so hard.  Oh, I'm so happy.  What a weight off my shoulders.  This is huge.  I mean, it's a language. 
[01:08:30]  I think it pokes fun in the best possible way.  Oh, thank goodness.  Oh, I was afraid it was going to be crass.  Thank goodness the best possible way.  Oh, fun for everybody without going too far.  That's nice to hear.  Yes.  That's what America wants, Jimmy.  It sure is.  That's what they want.  That's what I want, at least.  To heck with everyone.  I mean, the cultural differences. 
[01:09:00]  See it for everybody.  I think it pokes fun in the best possible way.  Oh, good.  Oh, God.  I was hoping.  I wrote letters saying,  I hope they're not going to do worst case scenario type comedy.  I don't go for that.  The best possible way.  Which is with racial epithets and stereotypes.  Yes.  Yes.  We own a hubcap store. 
[01:09:30]  They're giving the show a big slot, too, right after Big Bang Theory.  That's a big audience, though.  I mean, the Spanish audience is a big audience.  So they're expecting big things in the show.  You hear the theme song for it?  Oh, with that dumb dancing.  Boy, they really went all out for the opening credits.  Get us a fucking rag to hang behind these people and let them just dance.  Stupid.  It's a language.  It's a country. 
[01:10:00]  Just the people are different.  Well, the Mexican home life and traditions are typically touchy-feely, warm and fuzzy,  and a lot of physical contact, which Rob is exactly the opposite.  He doesn't like to be touched.  He's very OCD.  Sorry, it's a little tight here.  It's a little tight.  Okay, I'll get very close.  Somebody's breathing in my ear.  Rob must now make a good impression on Mom and Dad.  They're not that excited at the beginning.  But, you know, with time, I think they're really going to grow to love him.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a landscape architect. 
[01:10:30]  Oh.  You're a gardener.  What's so hilarious about this is seeing him doing his very bad...  Pause that.  You know what the name of this show should be called?  Turnabout is fair play.  Turnabout is fair play, everybody.  Usually, we think of them as the gardeners.  But in this case, he's the gardener.  Welcome to Turnabout is fair play.  Oh, they did that with the cab driver joke earlier, too. 
[01:11:00]  Yes, they did.  It's all going to be reverse stereotypes.  Oh, that's good.  I don't know.  Because they reverse it.  There's a beheading.  I'll bet a Mexican is beheaded.  Oh, no.  That won't happen.  Turnabout is fair play.  Tuesdays in CBS.  Yes.  What the fuck was that? 
[01:11:30]  You fucking asshole.  My cough is still lingering, but I've caught his cheese in my throat.  Ow!  I got shocked!  Dude.  God, you sucker.  Oh, my God.  Your ears got shocked.  Yes, they did.  Turnabout is fair play.  All right, sorry.  Sorry.  Keep going.  Trying to fit in and trying to be light, but kind of mucking it up.  Mucking it up.  Good thing you didn't say fucking it up.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:00]  I believe it's called guacamole.  It's like a punching bag.  You can't walk by without punching it, you know?  Hey, impressive.  You know your stuff.  He is great.  He's one of a kind, you know?  And they will see that.  He sucks.  Eventually.  And there's Uncle Hector, who just got into town.  I'm visiting from Mexico for the weekend.  It's nice.  I'm not leaving.  Hector is one uncomfortable relative.  And although Rob tries his best, problems soon around. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, boy.  The shrine fell down.  That was actually funny.  That's not very pleasant.  Hey, pause that part where Uncle Hector comes in and he goes,  I want to touch it.  The boy's a culo.  I want to come in and put it in my finger.  It is a culo.  I don't think that's going to be seen on the show, to be honest with you.  I am a 57 ans young.  I don't know how to say this word. 
[01:13:00]  57 ans.  He's got an Italian accent.  I turn about as a fair play.  It would be Tio Pablo, right?  Yes.  Very good.  For the first time, we have a chance to really unite the Mexican, Mexican-American, American  audience because of the people in the cast.  Wow.  This show has a chance to be like a Hispanic all-in-the-family.  Ah.  Oh, he did not just say that.  All-in-the-fam-ia. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, I like that.  Well, I'll bet you that the Mexicans are saying some very funny, inappropriate things.  Oh, they have.  Hey, dear.  Meat taco.  Meat taco.  I can make everybody laugh.  I-Rob.  See?  It's Rob.  I-Rob.  That's hilarious.  I'm sticking with I-Rob. 
[01:14:00]  Sorry.  Sorry, people.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Almost as good as Jimmy's new laugh. 
[01:14:30]  Almost as good.  His cottage cheese laugh.  Yes, I'm already stuck.  I'm a mess today.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Oh, they really are going to zing Rob good.  I can't wait to hear him get some zingers thrown at him.  They certainly are.  I'll say.  Yeah, now we got this story, which is, wow, a doozy.  Oh.  You want a doozy?  Oh, I love a doozy.  After picking up a pizza at Papa John's,  a woman named Minhee Cho looked at her seat where her name should be 
[01:15:00]  and saw something disquieting.  Name, Lady Chinky Eyes.  Natalie.  Isn't that opening on Broadway?  Yeah, she's a marvelous singer.  I'm so glad the entire room had the same reaction.  Oh, she's a wonderful singer.  She talks to all her riddle monsters.  I love the news, stupid lady.  I had to fucking say that.  Oh, that is great. 
[01:15:30]  Name, Lady Chinky Eyes.  Naturally, she took to her Twitter account and posted a picture of it,  which has since been retweeted over 500 times,  saying, hey, Papa John's, just FYI, my name isn't Lady Chinky Eyes.  At first, the manager of the store responded to the press by saying,  I'm sure they didn't mean any harm, but some people will take it offensive.  Since then, corporate has taken over by announcing on Facebook that the employee responsible is being fired.  Oh.  Fired.  Yeah, you've got to fire someone for that.  I forgot all about that laugh. 
[01:16:00]  Just how she has to keep a straight face and say that on the news.  Yeah.  Lady Chinky Eyes.  I heard the excuse for this, though, and legitimately, no joke.  They were saying that they usually, because they don't know the people's names,  and they get the order together and then have to give it to them,  so they usually say, guy, you know, guy with the blue tie on,  or, you know, guy with the bald guy or something.  So Lady Chinky Eyes was a way for them to know which woman it was. 
[01:16:30]  Instead of just saying Asian.  Right.  You put Lady Chinky Eyes.  He called her a lady, though.  Yeah.  It wasn't just chinky eyes.  That's a rough one.  That is a hard one to defend.  Yeah, okay.  Damn, you know what we need, Van, over that to really cheer everybody up,  have that sad story?  Mm-hmm.  Some theme music.  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on.  Do you want to do the whole story again?  Want to do a little production?  Oh, I have to get the theme music. 
[01:17:00]  I don't have access to it.  Oh, my goodness.  You want the story and the theme music?  What do you want to do, Jimmy?  Just the theme music with anything.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't matter what it is.  Whatever we're talking about, theme music should...  Theme music's great.  Isn't it wonderful?  It's horrible.  A muted trumpet.  Slow.  And then this wacky...  Yeah, it's slow.  It's boring.  It's boring as fuck.  It's just them standing in front of colored paper background. 
[01:17:30]  Why is he dancing?  Why is he dancing like that with a plunger?  There's a better version, though, where he just does a little dance where he's just moving  the plunger a little bit and not dancing.  Oh, really?  Where's that version?  Yeah.  Wait.  That part.  I don't mean to get this stuck in anybody's heads.  No, that won't happen.  It's horrible.  A kid bouncing a ball.  Yay.  Why did every kid have to have that haircut back then?  Every kid needed that little haircut. 
[01:18:00]  Who started that?  What's his name there?  Lawrence?  Joey Lawrence had that haircut.  It's the Joey Lawrence?  Yeah.  I guess this is common practice.  We got Justin in Jersey.  Justin?  About the Lady Chinky Eye thing.  Yeah.  But they went a little too far with that one, obviously.  Yellow.  Some would say.  Justin, go.  Yeah.  I bartended.  When I first started bartending, they didn't tell me the names went on the tickets. 
[01:18:30]  And when I gave the girls the receipt, I put two fat chicks.  And they were like, what the hell is this?  I was like, I'm sorry.  I guess I'm behind you guys' dinner.  Oh, you didn't know it went on the receipt?  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Wow.  How fat were they?  Yeah, how much the dinner cost you?  They were some big girls.  That's why I'm asking.  What?  Oh.  Excuse me?  What happened?  How big were they?  They were some big girls.  What?  Oh, they were big girls.  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the one where Mr. Roper is first, right? 
[01:19:00]  That's what I'm saying.  This is the controversy.  This is why we got to play football.  Okay, let's see the other one.  No, let's see the other one with the dance difference.  Yeah.  For Christ's sake.  Oh, no.  Oh, I need to get that music.  Oh, I hate this.  Oh, there's Norman Fell.  Same dance though.  No, there's one where there's a different dance.  So there's three versions.  You see how he's dancing longer?  Look.  And he's alone. 
[01:19:30]  And now Audra Lindley does a little dance with her feather boas and her muumuu.  And he comes in.  And he comes in and abuses her.  Thank God they didn't change the song, though.  Yeah.  Oh, I fucked up the...  I don't know.  This is so...  And she does the tennis serve.  Why?  Wait, what?  Audra Lindley does a little dance with her feather boas and her muumuu.  And he comes in.  And he comes in and abuses her.  Thank God they didn't change the song, though. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I fucked up the...  I don't know.  This is so...  And she does the tennis serve.  Why?  Where's Evan Cohen?  And there's little Evan Cohen.  He's bouncing it.  He's bouncing it.  I love when I bounce a ball.  This makes no sense.  Now, who are they?  They're the neighbors.  Who's the couple?  Oh, they're the ones that moved into...  It's a duplex.  Did they move into...  Next Door, look.  That's why they're showing the house with the two doors. 
[01:20:30]  I don't remember.  But I can't...  I really want to find the one where Stanley just does the little dance where he's just moving his arms.  Yeah, well...  I think it's the syndicated version, which is...  They have to be faster in syndicated versions, right?  Because they...  I think so, yeah.  They have less time.  Yeah, they cut everything down.  Chris in Philly, if we could find this, I would love to see this.  Channel 6 in Philly had an Asian reporter, Nydia Han, read the story about Lady Chinky Eyes,  and she looked pissed when she had to say Lady Chinky Eyes.  Oh!  Why would they give the Asian that... 
[01:21:00]  Well, I guess that's what the news does, right?  That's all they got.  Black guy goes into the fucking hood for the black stories, and yeah.  Maybe that's all they got.  You know what channel it is?  Channel 6 here in Philly.  But then it starts off slow, but then the joy comes through.  Yes, it really does.  I hate that.  You don't like that song?  Oh, terrible.  Terrible.  I love it. 
[01:21:30]  They're the worst instruments you could use for a sitcom opening.  I know.  I'd rather hear a fucking, like a rhino skull playing with a spoon.  No Lady Chinky Eye?  No?  The reporter here, but...  All right, if you find it.  Yeah.  If anybody gets that version, we'll have to stop the show for it.  If we find it, though, that'll be good, you know.  The other version is really...  We're looking hard for it. 
[01:22:00]  I want to hear the ropers.  We got Jim Brewer coming in today.  We got Seth Rogen coming in today.  To promote 50-50, I guess, on Blu-ray or something like that.  Yes.  And also his charity, I believe.  And Robert Zazio.  And Dr. Robin Zazio from Hoarders.  Yes, from Hoarders.  And when we get back, we either can play Hoarders Audio.  Yeah.  Or...  Sam's TV.  Yeah.  All right, let's do Sam's TV next.  If you don't know what's going on, just stick around, please.  It's a good one. 
[01:22:30]  It really is.  But first, the boys came up with American War Stories with Bob Kelly.  Oh, I got to hear this.  We're debuting this right now.  Yeah, I like this one.  Oh, I got to hear this.  On the next American War Stories.  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we brought little bars and stuff.  There's going to be no food.  There was more... 
[01:23:00]  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was...  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you wanted.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more. 
[01:23:30]  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man!  On the next American War Stories.  The new theme song for The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:24:00]  I hope you like it.  Jimmy's dancing with a plunger.  He's shoving it up Sam's asshole.  Before this...  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Awful.  If that was a good idea at the time.  Yeah.  This is going to be bothering a lot of people all day. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  Womp, womp, womp, womp.  Oh, good God.  This is wonderful.  Obviously the same people that put together the Three's Company theme.  Because I'm hearing some similarities.  This was the outtakes from the Three's Company theme.  Yeah.  They were just jamming.  Fuck it.  Before that was Grey Wolf, which just drives us nuts every time. 
[01:25:00]  That's not a full song.  I still think he could do it.  We've tried.  What does he do when he...  It's just a taste.  Yeah, yeah, me from the poor way.  Then we should...  We've tried.  We should write it.  We've tried everything.  What happens?  We put our best guy on a true boogie.  He's useless.  Not Drew.  The story was that Grey Wolf kept insisting that he needed to use the flute and he wouldn't sing.  Yeah.  And he just kept playing the flute.  And Drew Boogie was like, I just need enough to work with. 
[01:25:30]  Did he have any lyrics for Grey Wolf?  I don't remember.  That's what it was.  Grey Wolf probably couldn't think of any lyrics.  No.  Blowing on his flute.  We had all...  Yeah.  Flute.  Grey Wolf, it turns out, surprise.  He was tough to work with.  A homeless guy?  All we needed was one more.  We could have gotten it.  We still could.  Patrice loved that song.  He used to depress it.  Everyone loves it.  And I got a message.  It's very brief.  From his mother, who I spoke to.  And she just wanted me to say to everybody, thank you. 
[01:26:00]  Very, very much.  I talked to Georgia on...  What's today?  Monday?  I think it was yesterday afternoon.  Me and Bobby are going to see her this week.  So she said that she's read a lot of the messages and it meant so much to her.  And I invited her in to speak.  But she's like, it's too emotional.  I can't.  But she sincerely says thank you to the people that sent messages.  That's awesome.  A lot of them were read by the family.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  That's nice.  The CD, Mr. P, is coming out soon.  Patrice O'Neal's last CD he was working on. 
[01:26:30]  I got my advance copy.  We all did, yeah.  I'm selling mine.  Yeah, I'm selling mine.  Sell it.  It's what Patrice would want.  Yeah.  He wanted me to get blown with his proceeds.  Well, we got a TV to smash.  Yes, we do.  And we got Brewer coming in.  We got Seth Roughton coming in.  And Dr. Robin Zazio.  From Dr. Robin.  Brewer's doing that heavy metal family man tour.  And I haven't seen the new heavy metal thing he's doing.  But supposedly it was like a big hit over in Europe. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  Yeah, like on OzFest.  Europe.  Europe is nice.  Oh, wow.  So, Sam.  Yeah.  You lost a bet.  Yeah.  On Friday.  It was an easy bet to lose, by the way.  You're a dummy.  It wasn't easy.  It could have gone either way.  You insisted that I went to Die Harder.  No.  Live Free or Die Hard.  See, I don't even know the name of the movie.  There was a Die Harder.  Oh, there was?  I think so.  Live Free or Die Hard.  Well, everyone went to the premiere. 
[01:27:30]  This is a few years ago.  And everyone insisted I went.  I'm like, I know I didn't go.  Well, Sam definitely thought you went.  Yeah, so we bet TVs.  I wanted to go for the living room TV.  But Sam agreed to the bedroom TVs.  My bedroom TV versus his bedroom TV.  Well, I felt like that was a good bet because.  It's not a good bet.  My bedroom TV is 52 inches.  Yours is 12 inches.  That's why it's a good bet for me.  Oh, yeah.  Fair enough.  That is a good bet for you.  But mine's got a built-in VCR.  Yours doesn't have any way to play home movies on it.  Right.  Built in.  Then E-Rock stepped up to the plate and proved that I was the one that was right. 
[01:28:00]  I did not go to the premiere.  Hence, you lost your bedroom TV.  Yes.  And you brought it in, right?  Yeah.  You want me to go get it?  Yes.  That would be.  Like, I still think he was hoping he would lose it and force him into getting something  different.  I don't know.  12 inch.  A 12 inch cathode ray fucking quasar television for your bedroom.  Well, what we learned on Friday, though, is he's really attached to this thing for whatever 
[01:28:30]  weird reason.  He's a weirdo.  What do we make break it?  Oh, it's all set.  Oh, okay.  E-Rock.  He is.  Okay.  E-Rock is very prepared.  T to the R.  What hurts more?  Sam doing it or E-Rock doing it?  Mm.  Like, I'm wondering.  E-Rock.  Okay.  E-Rock.  Because E-Rock has a lot of anger built up.  Anytime E-Rock can get one over on Sam, Sam doesn't like it.  Right.  But, you know, I've asked E-Rock a few times this morning off mic.  I'm like, are you ready to do this?  You're not going to.  You're not.  All right.  I'll ask him live.  You're ready to do this, right? 
[01:29:00]  I'm ready.  You're not going to wimp out.  Oh, my God.  He brought in a sledgehammer.  Oh, God.  I am so ready.  Did you buy a brand new sledgehammer for this?  Yes, I did.  I brought safety goggles for everybody.  Wow.  There you go.  Oh, is it tempting?  Hold on, hold on.  Look at stupid Sam.  Mr. Coombe.  Look how heavy this 12-inch TV is, Ant.  Cool.  Look down the hall.  Look at this.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's having a hard time.  Wow.  Sledgehammers are great. 
[01:29:30]  And here's Sam entering the studio with the very heavy 12-inch.  That thing weighs a ton, doesn't it?  Yeah.  TV-VCR combo.  Quasar?  Quasar.  From what year?  Uh, probably the late 90s.  Late 90s.  How handy is this during contract negotiations?  No shits.  Nice.  Goggins for everybody.  What will the, um, what will the phosphor do to us?  The what?  What's phosphor?  There's phosphor inside the cathode ray tube. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know what the phosphor is for.  I never use phosphor.  That's what illuminates when it is hit with the electron beams.  Well, it's turned off, though, so we should be good.  It's not plugged in.  It's not plugged in, so we should be good.  There was a tape in the VCR I had to take out.  What was the tape?  I don't know.  It was some old lacrosse tape that I never remember having, but the tape was all stuck  in there.  Uh-oh.  Well, maybe it wasn't.  Maybe you taped over it, and there was a little sex film.  What do you mean, an old lacrosse tape?  It said lacrosse on the label. 
[01:30:30]  Who watches lacrosse tapes?  I have no idea.  Or it's lacrosse.  Exactly.  Weirdo?  I have no idea.  Hmm.  You worried at it?  Well, I'm doing a little research now.  Okay.  Hmm.  Anyone know anything about, what is it?  Phosphor?  Phosphor?  Seattle.  Phosphor.  Phosphorus, let's see.  Yeah.  Cathode ray tube.  It might be dangerous.  Maybe we just don't even do it.  It's yours.  Let's see.  How dangerous? 
[01:31:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  When was that unplugged?  It was unplugged on Saturday.  Oh.  Why?  Does that matter?  Mm-hmm.  It does.  Like, I didn't watch it last night.  They have capacitors inside them to store up the energy.  They don't necessarily just, you know, you could still get a high-voltage shock from an  unplugged television.  How long after it's unplugged?  Yeah, that varies, Jim.  That varies.  Ah, let's see. 
[01:31:30]  Electronic fluorescent.  Ah, let's just go for it.  It's unplugged Saturday morning.  Well, you should be okay.  I brought it in Saturday afternoon.  Ah, yeah.  We're fine.  We're overthinking this.  Well, I like to weigh all danger.  Am I right or wrong?  Get your goggles on, Jimmy.  Hold on.  I don't need goggles from way over here.  You should get it.  Yeah.  What, do you think glass can't reach over there?  Just put it in.  Well, thanks, man.  Oh, really?  Swap.  All right, give me my goggles.  Who brought any goggles?  You did, Eric?  Yeah.  You rock prepared.  And a sledgehammer.  What a good guy.  Yes, he is. 
[01:32:00]  Thanks, Z.  How'd he open this?  You brought, you bought, did you buy the sledgehammer?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And bought all these brand new goggles for us.  Yeah, but you also got to remember, he's got it like that.  He's got the cash.  You had some pocket money laying around?  Yeah, it's not the same as it is on other people.  So, even though I won the bet, I chose E-Rock to break the TV.  Because I know E-Rock's got some stored up venom.  I don't know why.  I'm going to put on my safety goggles. 
[01:32:30]  Come on, E-Rock.  Safety goggles first.  Safety goggles.  Hold on.  Safety goggles.  What about Paul?  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Paul, what about goggles for you?  Yay.  Ah, Paul laughs at goggles.  A goggles, a paisano.  Oh, boy.  Great.  So.  Huh?  You think you're going to be able to fucking chip in his goggles?  Wow, these are the most uncomfortable goggles ever.  I know.  What are you doing?  Welding at something?  They cut in.  The edges are like razor blades. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  You should shave with them.  That's all they had at that time.  Wow.  Jesus.  Poor fucking Mexicans.  These goggles are hurting my face.  They really do hurt, right?  Oh.  They're like sharp over here.  These goggles suck.  Wow.  Where'd you get these?  Pointy goggles?  Ted's goggles.  Yes.  The goggle emporium.  Yes, the goggle emporium.  I've cut out the eye hole, Gregory, to help with vision.  But that defeats the purpose.  Yes, it certainly does, Anthony.  I'm being sued.  I want to go to that mic. 
[01:33:30]  What mic is that?  Yeah, that one down there.  No, I want that one.  Yeah, the boss said what the boss said.  Talk you to that one.  Hello.  Okay, move it over to Paul.  Ow.  Eh?  Ow, these are hurting my face.  You gotta take a napkin.  I'd rather have the glass.  Take a napkin and fold it up and put it under the nose part.  They look like douchebags.  I'd rather look like a douchebag than fucking have the thing cutting me.  Yeah, well, for a second you were doing both.  Hold on.  Oh, that's better.  That's better.  Fold it nice.  Eric just bought the sledgehammer so he could go home and play Triple H later. 
[01:34:00]  No, he wants to use it at dinner.  Oh, God.  Help tenderize meat.  Ugh.  Why is the TV facing that way?  Exactly.  You non-fucking TV directional.  I thought the glass would shoot out this way.  That's good.  You want to shoot it at us?  Why don't you just fucking turn it the other way?  That's what I did.  That's what he's doing.  Huge, hungry hippo.  Ah!  See?  That's, well, okay.  Anyway, so you got a sledgehammer.  Yeah.  That's good.  It's just a sledgehammer. 
[01:34:30]  Well, E-Rock just smashed the TV.  I'm giving him the honor today.  Okay.  No, you got to smash it into the glass.  What's going on?  Am I right or wrong?  Is he doing it wrong?  Wait, what does he want to do?  He wants to smash it facing the other way.  Why wouldn't you just smash the glass part?  Because I didn't want the glass shooting towards you if I turned it around.  He put it on its back.  If you, no, if you, I'll tell you what, if you turn the glass toward you and then do like  a golf shot, boof, right into it.  That would be nice.  Yeah, and you're not going to get as much of the glass going. 
[01:35:00]  Why don't we just give it to somebody who could use it?  Why don't you just take it into the next room?  Why don't you shut up, Sam?  Take it to the next room and break it and tell us about it.  Okay.  Now, these things are vacuum sealed.  Are they?  So you could get an implosion kind of a thing going on.  This is a bad idea.  I think it'll be okay, though.  A vacuum seal.  I think, oh boy.  Oh, my God.  This is the worst.  We're all hiding behind Anthony.  All right.  People can't puke in here, but we can do this.  E-Rock is lined up, ready to take that first shot.  Sam, how do you feel right about now?  Bad is the word. 
[01:35:30]  Bad?  This was your TV.  How many wrestling things have you watched on this?  I mean, I've watched thousands of hours of professional wrestling on that television.  Yeah.  Took it up to Syracuse, brought it back home.  I moved it into three different apartments.  Yeah.  That's my TV.  We'll do you a favor, though.  How's it a favor?  Who has a 12-inch Quasar TV in their bedroom?  That is true.  You have a dumb television there.  It's stupid.  It's very smart.  It really has.  You have no business even having that dumb thing.  The amount of things you've.  That was.  And there's a lot of usage left in there. 
[01:36:00]  A lot of.  I mean, I could watch.  I could use that.  I could use that TV for years.  Hey, can we put the TV up on a chair?  A little elevation, really?  Yeah, why not?  Why?  I don't know if you need it.  Do we have anything else laying around?  It's on the ground.  It's way too far on the ground.  For what?  It's not safer on the ground.  Because he's going to hit it with a.  Yeah, and the chairs spin.  Yeah, I think if you leave.  This is better on the ground.  It keeps the glass from flying even further.  Just bend down low, and you can get the same camera angle.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  You just kind of hit it like a golf swing. 
[01:36:30]  All right, Iraq.  Don't do it.  If it doesn't break, Iraq.  Watch it, Sam.  You're going to watch.  It's golf like a golf swing.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Now it's broken.  It certainly is broken.  Wow.  Looks like you stepped on it.  Iraq stepped on it.  Oh, wow.  Iraq.  You think it could be repaired? 
[01:37:00]  No.  One more shot.  Here goes Iraq.  Don't do it.  Oh, man.  There was a lot more usage in that.  There was a lot more episodes to be watched.  What a waste.  See a TV come apart like that.  Look at all the parts.  They're all valuable.  That's the way the TV laughs.  Feeling good, Sam?  No.  Why would I be feeling good?  My TV's broken.  Now you can get a new one.  I did get a new one, but I didn't have to get a new one. 
[01:37:30]  I could have used that TV for years.  You could have.  Honestly, that was actually a good TV.  There was no reason to destroy it.  What was the reason to smash it like that?  All those parts.  You lost a bet.  Those parts had a lot more use in them, too.  Do it for Norman Fell and Audra Lindley.  Could have given them to somebody.  I bet you that TV's the one that canceled the Ropers.  That TV's awful.  But yeah, but there was still.  You could have got a new TV after this one had run its course. 
[01:38:00]  That's the point.  Well, there is so much debris.  Yeah.  There's a lot of debris.  All those parts were still good.  Flotsam and jetsam.  That's how I felt when he was smashing it and you could hear all the parts in it.  Yeah.  It made me feel like there was more.  There was so much stuff just being destroyed for no reason.  Yeah.  Does that smell healthy that we're all breathing?  Nah, it's a terrible, awful, dangerous smell of cathode ray tube lining.  D-Rock, how do you feel?  Oh, so much better.  Cool. 
[01:38:30]  You feel good about this?  Why do you feel good?  You're just destroying something of value for no reason.  You're just wasting.  He's been doing that on the radio show for seven years.  I guess we're done smashing it.  I could take these goddamn goggles off.  Anyone else want to take a shot?  There's nothing left.  No.  There's a piece of the screen on my chair.  Oh, it was running to you for safety.  Yeah.  A lot of usage left.  Help us, daddy.  Oh, well.  That's a waste.  That's what I was thinking.  That's money wasted.  That is a big waste.  Terrible. 
[01:39:00]  That was pretty impressive, though, man.  Yep.  E-Rock got a good swing on it.  Huh?  E-Rock got a good swing on it.  Fuck yeah.  I did buy a new TV on Saturday.  Oh, good.  Oh, you did.  Now that I want to hear.  What happened?  Now, you bought a new one.  Is it new?  It's brand new.  Brand new.  Yep.  How much?  How much you spend?  $199.  $199.  $199.  $200 was the limit.  And what type of TV did you guess?  Can we guess?  Well, first, what about store brand inches? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, I'm going to guess.  Okay.  It's definitely under $32.  Jesus Christ.  You went to Best Buy.  Incorrect.  You went to Radio Shack.  Incorrect.  You went to Two Guys.  Incorrect.  You found a coupon, didn't you?  No.  PC Richards.  No.  It's a big chain store, though.  No, it's not.  We just named them all.  You just named them all.  Best Buy.  Best Buy.  No, it wasn't Best Buy.  You went to, like what?  Like a Sears?  No, close.  JCPenney? 
[01:40:00]  No, come on.  Walmart?  Yes.  You went to Walmart to get a television.  Well, they do have a good TV section.  I know.  Okay.  Super saver.  So you go to Walmart.  I'll take the soup.  Well, it gets me every time.  You went to Walmart.  Yes.  And you picked up a Sony.  No.  All right.  Let's go down a couple of notches.  You've got a Philips.  No.  A Quasar.  I wish.  No.  I would have replaced a Quasar with a Quasar, but they didn't have one. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Did you get a Symphonic?  No.  It was a...  Westinghouse?  Insignia?  Tetley?  Vizio.  Sharp?  Vizio.  Vizio?  What the fuck is Vizio?  I don't know, but Dr. Robin Vizio.  Oh, Zazio.  Zazio.  Did you get a Zazio?  No.  Yeah.  I got a Vizio.  A Vizio?  Yeah.  From who?  Relatives?  Vizio.  You hear the big fucking...  Yes, I hear it.  Chunks of garbage going into... 
[01:41:00]  It's not garbage.  It's garbage going into garbage.  Immerse yourself...  Into a Vizio.  Discover the stunning brightness...  Yeah.  ...and flicker-free quality of Vizio.  Why did you pick the Vizio?  It's cheap.  It's inexpensive.  Cheap.  So, you got the Vizio...  Yeah.  ...at Walmart.  Yeah.  And what size is your television?  Well, can we guess?  Oh.  I'm going 24 inches.  Okay.  Anthony?  I'm going to say for Vizio at Walmart, 200 bucks. 
[01:41:30]  It's got to be a 32.  32 inches on sale, I'll bet.  Okay.  54 inches...  Oh, no.  ...is how big both my TVs are.  This is 22.  32 and 22 is 54.  You got a 22-inch Vizio.  Why do you do this?  Why didn't you get the 32?  Because it was for the bedroom.  Because it was probably 10 bucks more.  Because his OCD said that you can only spend up to 200.  How much would the...  Yeah, I wasn't going over 200. 
[01:42:00]  But how much would the 32 cost?  249.  Oh.  All right.  250.  Oh, my God.  For 50 lousy bucks, you could have got...  That's 25% more.  You could have got 10 more inches.  Yeah.  At Walmart, they had the 32-inch Vizio for 249.  What's wrong with you?  22-inch sucks.  Oh.  No, it doesn't.  See, look.  It's much bigger than the Quasar was.  It's still sitting on the Tupperware.  Look at it.  It looks like a monitor.  I have a bigger monitor in the Compound fucking studio as a monitor. 
[01:42:30]  Bigger than 22 inches?  Yes.  It's like 30 fucking inches.  Is just thrilled with the 22-inch now?  Oh.  She went from 12 to 22.  That's a huge difference.  Why didn't you get a...  Sam's chair's not even doubled.  And can you wall mount it?  I don't know.  You probably could, theoretically.  What are you...  Because it's a bedroom TV, it doesn't need to be...  Bring it in.  You're smashing it.  That's getting smashed.  No, I paid $200 for it.  I'm not bringing anything in.  I will give you $200 so we can smash your new TV.  Well, it's $214 with tax.  Fine.  I'll give you $215. 
[01:43:00]  I'll sell it to you for $250.  No.  $215, you bring it in, we smash that, and then you do the right thing, the proper thing,  and you get a 32-inch.  No.  I'll let you smash it.  Let's start over.  I'll let you smash it for the price of a 32-inch.  Nope.  Can it end?  No, that's not...  Yeah, that's an 8-inch.  Jimmy, you're right.  22 inches is good.  It's flat screen.  It's HD, although the cable box is not HD, so we're not looking at HD stuff yet.  Right now, it's just coaxial.  But you didn't get the VCR with this?  No, I got a couple VCRs, so that's okay. 
[01:43:30]  You're going to hook up a VCR to this?  Well, there's a DVD VCR hooked up to it now.  A what?  DVD recorder VCR.  Sam, why?  In case I need to transfer VHS to DVD.  People start with...  How long can you do that?  People start with 32 inches.  They start there, I think.  There was a 17-inch, and I said, no, I'll go for the 22.  Was Jess with you when you bought this?  Uh-huh.  What'd she say?  She said, how much do you want to spend?  And I said, I don't want to spend more than 200.  She said, okay.  She's like, all right, cheapo.  Yeah, weird chiseling. 
[01:44:00]  No.  How big is 22 inches?  I don't even know.  There was a 17-inch, and I didn't buy it.  I bought the 22.  How big is 22-inch, though?  Eh, fucking...  Double the monitor size right here.  That's it, right?  Yeah.  It looks big in the bedroom.  Is that 22 inches?  No, that...  No, 22 inches is bigger than this monitor.  That's a 17.  That's a 17, so a little bigger than that.  See, you're showing her, though, that this is going to be the rest of her life skimping  and chiseling.  Tell him.  Jess getting slightly less than she really wants or expects. 
[01:44:30]  No.  Well, according to Michael, Walmart has a Scepter, I guess it's called.  Scepter.  I don't know.  32 inches for $209.  No Vizio.  I didn't see it there.  For $209, you could have got a 32-inch.  Well...  No, I made the right choice.  22 inches, you could wall-mount it with a thumbtack.  It's a photo.  Brian Stone.  I could put a little string on the back and just hang it up like a picture frame.  Oh, my God.  This guy's saying his daughter has a 17-inch laptop monitor. 
[01:45:00]  Well, that's why I didn't get the 17-inch.  I got the 22.  Are you doing this for good radio?  No.  You're just so frustrating.  You finally had the chance to do the right thing.  But I didn't get the 17-inch.  I didn't get the cheapest one.  Fuck the 17-inch.  That's what I said.  Get the 32.  No one even looks.  You go, all right, where's the...  You see the wall of TVs.  Like, okay, 32.  Okay, here's 32.  Now let me see how big I can get here before it gets crazy.  I'm always trying to get, like, the biggest right.  The biggest TV.  But we all start at 32 and go, oh, man, that 60 would look good.  But I can't afford that.  All right, I'm going to move back down this way a little bit.  I went to the TV wall, walked all the way to the right, and then started making my way back. 
[01:45:30]  And then ended all the way to the left.  No, no, no.  The right was the cheapest.  So I walked all the way to the cheapest.  How many TVs were smaller than the one you bought?  Just the 17.  A 17-inch, and that was it, right?  Yeah, just the 17-inch.  So you bought the second one in.  There might have been a 21-inch from a different brand.  Oh, some people are saying when you go to turn the TV off, do you just hold it over your head and shake it?  So that's an extra sketch you're thinking of.  Poor Sam is a victim of growing up with seeing chiseling and skimping. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's terrible.  But I got the TV.  It's 22 inches.  It's flat screen.  It's 1080p.  Wow.  So is my phone.  Oh.  Hey, are you happy with it, Sam, or you don't care?  I mean, it's cool to see.  I mean, it looks very big in the bedroom because I'm used to looking at 12-inch on a Quasar.  Well, yeah, right.  So it looks big from what we're used to.  And do you like the extended ratio there?  Yeah, that's nice to have. 
[01:46:30]  But at the same time, the picture's not as good as it should be because I'm just using the coaxial  because I've got to clear off the DVR before I can replace the cable box.  How old's your cable box?  You don't have an HDMI out?  No.  Does that have an HDMI in the VazVizio?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got two HDMI in.  Okay, so your cable box doesn't have an HDMI out?  Because it's not an HD cable box.  Oh, my God.  Well, how long have you had it?  I brought it from the old apartment, so a couple years. 
[01:47:00]  Did you buy this just to piss off the listeners because they're calling you brilliant?  No, I didn't buy it.  They're like, holy shit, he's brilliant.  He bought the 22-inch just to piss everyone off.  Like the Prestige?  I just live the act?  But if you would have bought a 32-inch, we all would have went, all right, that's fair enough.  Well, I'm not going to have it.  We wouldn't even have thought twice.  We're like, all right, I would have went bigger, but 32-inch, okay, fine.  But I'm not going to have a TV in the living room and the bedroom that's the same size.  The bedroom TV is smaller.  But your TV in the living room is too small.  I want you. 
[01:47:30]  Because the bedroom TV should be smaller because it's just a bedroom TV.  No, it shouldn't.  It should be bigger.  Because if I had a 32-inch in the bedroom, then you should have a bigger TV in the living room.  It is odd that somebody who grew up kind of spoiled doesn't spoil itself.  Yeah, I don't know where this is coming from.  It's a really weird thing.  Where's it coming from?  I don't think I was spoiled.  You are.  I'm glad it had no effect on me then.  Wow, people are just livid.  We'll tell them to worry about their TVs and I'll worry about mine.  This guy says he has a 32-inch in his truck. 
[01:48:00]  Well, he's wasting money.  Why would you have a 32-inch in your truck?  Why don't you pay attention to the road?  Because you want to enjoy watching TV.  You can actually put your fucking TV on a letter and mail it.  No one buys a 22-inch television.  Was Jess sort of excited?  She's disgusted.  Was she like, oh, staring at the 32-inch?  Like, come on.  No, she likes a 22-inch.  But I think she... 
[01:48:30]  Did she told her?  No, I think she's a little...  She would much rather have the HD in that room.  But we'll get there.  Do you know my karaoke monitor in the basement is bigger?  How big is it?  Oh, 30.  That's a good size.  Yeah, but that's not saying anything crazy.  That's what people do.  When they want to see their shit, they start at 30, 32-inch.  Yeah.  What's on your DVR?  It's wrestling stuff that I got to tape.  How much?  There's not too much left, because I spent a lot of Christmas break, because I was like  two months behind on it, recording stuff to the DVD recorder off the DVR. 
[01:49:00]  You don't need to tape everything.  What are you going to do with this stuff?  It's all gettable now.  At one point, I understand you're doing that.  Yeah.  But now it's a waste, because people can not only get it, but they can get it in better  quality than you have.  It's a ritual.  Yeah.  You just gave yourself another job.  A job.  It's a stupid ritual.  Now you're archiving.  Now you have to obsess and go, oh my god, do I have every single wrestling show that's  being aired?  I get really upset when I forget to DVR a show.  You should stop doing it, because now in this day and age, on Hulu, on the websites, it's 
[01:49:30]  not necessary.  It's like you can literally get whatever you want in better quality online.  You're wasting your time.  You're going to be buried alive under wrestling tapes.  Maybe.  Fast forward 10 years.  I don't think so.  Everything's under control.  22 inches.  Oh my god.  It's always under control until it's not.  Well, you just...  Good point.  Slight upgrades.  So you upgrade from a 12 inch to a 22 inch, and then when that TV stops working, you get  a bigger TV. 
[01:50:00]  TVs don't stop working.  They don't stop working.  That Vizio will be going for a fucking long time.  That'd be nice.  But you should...  The Roberts children will be watching it.  Get my 200 out of it.  Oh yeah.  One day it'll be in little Sam Jr.'s bedroom.  Oh my god.  It should be in his diapers.  You mean because it's shit?  Yeah.  Because it's shit.  Yes.  You are a pisser.  Vizio is going to be at CES.  Vizio is a good brand.  22 inches. 
[01:50:30]  It's a fine size just for the bedroom.  We don't exactly...  We don't have a compound where we got to have nice stuff in it.  No, we're not...  Well, you should have nice stuff.  Yeah.  That's what we're trying to say.  There's compound, sure.  It's all relative.  But then there's what regular people do, which is they start with 32 inches with their TVs.  Especially for 50 bucks.  Even people that are poorer than you.  I'm telling you right now.  We'll make sure they have a 32 inch TV in their bedroom.  But Jess is too nice, too.  Because you know when she looked at that for 50 more bucks, she wanted the 32 inch. 
[01:51:00]  And you both knew she wanted that.  But she's not a shallow person, so she wouldn't come out and go, you chiseler.  So she's like, okay.  And you both know that she's just agreeing with you.  You should go above and beyond and not just do the bare minimum.  And did it hurt to hand over that money?  I mean, I didn't like the whole having to do it.  Like, it was a waste.  No, it's not a waste.  It's not.  Your enjoyment has a money value, doesn't it?  And so does your girls.  Yeah.  You're just doing the bare minimum. 
[01:51:30]  You got to stop just doing the bare minimum.  Do a little extra.  A little bit.  Nothing too much.  A little more.  Snitch.  Is everybody so upset about my TVs anyway?  They're very upset.  People are not happy.  Just tell them don't even worry about it.  They have bigger TVs in their kitchen.  It's just endless.  Well, that's why this country is in a debt crisis.  Because people keep buying big TVs to put in their trucks.  I do like that he has an answer for everything, though.  I respect that.  It's true.  But now we've figured them out. 
[01:52:00]  It's all OCD justification.  Right.  Yeah, the wrestling thing.  It's just silly.  The wrestling thing is frightening that he needs to have these.  And he still cannot come up with a reason why he needs them.  He knows why.  It's OCD.  He absolutely knows what it is.  But I'm saying, years ago, I do get it.  Because you couldn't get them a few years ago.  There was no internet.  But you'll never watch them.  I don't have time.  All right.  Listen, we got to take a break.  Because they want to clean.  Sirius X wants to clean the studio.  Well, I would.  Because it's shattered glass all over the floor. 
[01:52:30]  Might be a slight hazard.  So they want to bring in some vacuums and stuff.  And Jim Brewer's here.  So do you have the smashing of the TV real fast?  I want to hear what it sounds like.  Once again, this is E-Rock smashing Sam's TV.  All right, E-Rock.  Don't do it.  If it doesn't break, E-Rock.  Watch it, Sam.  You're going to watch.  Golf.  Like a golf swing.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Now it's broken.  It certainly is broken.  Wow.  Looks like you stepped on it. 
[01:53:00]  E-Rock snapped on it, though.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  You think it could be repaired?  No.  One more shot.  Here goes E-Rock.  Don't do it.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  There was a lot more usage in that.  There was a lot more episodes to be watched.  What a waste.  What is a waste?  See a TV come apart like that.  They're all parts.  They're all boundaries.  To that was the end.  Really quick.  A lot of people are suggesting that we have Dr. Robin Zazio from Hoarders. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Talk to this asshole.  Definitely.  Talk to this asshole.  I'm not an asshole.  Because there is sort of an OCD slash hoarding thing happening.  I don't see.  I don't see.  And maybe she can explain to you what's going to end up happening if maybe you don't nip this  in the butt.  Her new book is about when people who aren't even as extreme as the people on Hoarders let  their possessions kind of become...  This is you.  This is you.  Thank God she's in today.  Yeah, this is perfect.  Mary Ann's family, the neighborhood, the heart attack, I got a lot to talk about. 
[01:54:00]  Look at that big piece of my TV screen right there.  What's that?  Look at that big piece of my TV.  Oh, wow.  Jim Brewer next.  Seth Rogen right around the corner.  Stay there.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:30]  Breaking the law.  That whole break they were vacuuming the studio.  It smells like shit in here, man.  Well, it smells like busted television.  Yeah, absolutely.  Got that electronic smell to it.  Absolutely.  We're good now, right?  Yeah.  We're good.  Sam.  Yes.  He was breaking the TV.  Breaking the TV.  Oh, good one, Chip.  Thanks.  What happened to Brewer?  I saw him outside. 
[01:55:00]  He just wandered off.  Eyes at half-mast.  But he's not high.  No.  Brewer's playing the Highline Ballroom here in New York City.  Heavy Metal Family Man Tour.  It's 830.  That's 16th Street in the city.  Highlineballroom.com.  When?  212, 414.  5994.  Yeah, what day is he playing?  When's he playing it?  I don't find any humor in that.  Brewer has a lot of updates for us. 
[01:55:30]  He's got a mom update, a pizza man update, a family update in general.  His website is Brewniverse.  That's like a real stretch.  Not Brewerniverse.  It's Brewniverse.  Brewniverse.  It's like the new mania.  Yeah.  He's so big, though.  He's bigger than the whole earth.  What is he standing on?  It's crazy.  Seth Rogen coming in soon, too. 
[01:56:00]  So we've got to get Brewer in here, man.  Here comes Jim.  Look at him.  Ah, yes.  Is he just talking to himself, or is he singing?  Yeah, he's probably singing Breaking the Laws.  Breaking the Laws.  Sure.  Our pal Jim Brewer.  Whoa, child.  Jim.  What's up, Jim?  What's up, man?  So Anthony looks smooth as a baby's ass.  Yeah.  And you look like...  Ow!  Let's get shocked.  His jacket came off. 
[01:56:30]  You got static electricity?  Oh, that's good.  And you get the whole Amish thing going.  Yeah.  I got an ugly beard.  Can't even just call it a beard.  No, no.  It's all good.  It's an ugly beard.  Jim goes, wow.  And Jim Brewer looks the same.  You think I should be living in Pennsylvania?  You look like you need a cart loop.  Oh, Amish, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Amish.  Build a little hot stove, put in the back of the deli news.  I want to go to Amish country. 
[01:57:00]  Is it cool?  It's boring.  Come on.  It's boring.  Fly pie.  There's good...  Is there a town, at least?  Is it like a main street?  You can walk around?  Yeah.  You can walk around there and see the Amish?  Yeah.  You go and you see the fudge they make or whatever they make and then you, you know...  And get the hell out of there.  Yeah.  He's done.  Shows over.  All right.  Yeah.  Is there an Amish bar?  No.  It's a butter.  What?  Drink, silly.  What about for all the people that are visiting?  I'll tell you one thing.  You'll be safe around there if you know what I'm talking about.  Yes. 
[01:57:30]  Are Amish allowed to carry?  Allowed to what?  Carry.  Pennsylvania.  It's very easy to get a weapon.  But the Amish themselves.  I don't know what their whole take on it is.  Religion.  I would think with the way they build things and stuff, that hunting is probably a big  thing with them.  They all got shotguns?  I would assume.  I don't know.  I would assume.  I don't know.  I'm going to say...  That's a way they're pretty free with their gun laws.  I don't know.  I'm going to say no.  They're more knives.  I don't think they're hunting with knives.  Yeah, they throw the knives.  Just jumping on a fucking deer and slitting its throat. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  It's not hard.  I got it in my yard.  Now I start feeding.  They come closer, grab that thing by the ear.  I think somebody has something to contribute.  Yeah.  I think so.  Oh, boy.  Kenny?  Oh, Kenny's going to let us know.  I saw Kenny.  Kenny knows all things.  I don't want to interrupt the great Jim Brewer, who's playing the Highline Ballroom, the  heavy metal Family Man tour.  Yes.  Actually, you must have been reading his website when you weren't ironing those pants.  But Brewer, we don't know when you're playing. 
[01:58:30]  We don't have that.  When's the date?  We know Friday.  This Friday?  Friday.  I think Friday night.  This Friday.  Here in New York City.  Highlineballroom.com for ticket info and all that crap.  But if you go to my Club Soda Kenny Facebook page, I have a picture of an Amish midget I  saw this weekend.  Wow.  What does that have to do with the fact that they could carry or not?  Oh, you're talking about Amish people.  I got a picture of me shooting a gun.  Too bad it's not aimed where it should have been. 
[01:59:00]  They don't even use electricity.  How do you want to use modern technology?  Guns are not modern technology.  The guns have been around way before electricity.  Kenny's pants have the longest zipper I've ever seen.  Look at how long that is.  I know.  Completely unnecessary.  I got a very low rise in my pants.  Why do you have such a low rise?  A lot of ballroom.  Why, though?  That's how you like it, huh?  No, because...  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  It's a hepatitis yellow shirt. 
[01:59:30]  He's got Fred Mertz pants.  He's got the biggest pants ever.  I buy cheap suits.  What do you say we go down to the club, Rick?  She was staring right at the camera.  Yeah, you took a picture like it's a freak show.  You know what, though?  You know what, though?  Nothing but respect for Kenny, because most people that take pictures of midgets, they  always take a picture of their backs.  They're not brave enough to fucking get up their faces.  Yeah, Kenny got their look in and everything. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  It looks like she's annoyed, too.  Oh, yeah.  Of course she is.  Well, what's she going to do?  Why are you taking a picture?  She can't even reach up to his balls.  But they don't talk like that.  They talk normally.  She's Amish.  And the Amish don't like having their pictures taken in general.  That's right.  Why?  Well, they think it steals their souls.  You think it takes your soul?  I know that's some African thing.  I read that the Amish burn midgets, though.  What?  Yeah.  They don't want midgets around.  I've never heard about that.  No, I read it somewhere.  Oh.  I read it somewhere.  I did, yeah.  Well, you got a mic in front of you.  It's got to be true.  That's right.  There's another picture, Sam. 
[02:00:30]  Were you trying to get a picture of the midget or Estelle Getty standing next to her?  I know, right?  Yeah, that's barely broad.  You got more than one?  Why are you taking up your burst?  Oh, down, down.  Did you use a gun?  Oh, that's Kenny shooting nice.  He's got a gun.  There.  The guy with his horse and buggy.  There he goes.  See, yeah.  If you want to go see the Amish.  I want to check out the Amish.  Why not?  Check out right there, Obe.  That's it, huh?  You got it.  That's all you're going to see?  There you go.  Horse and buggy.  You go to Central Park.  People go to the Amish.  Let's go to Amish country.  Yeah.  We'll see what?  We'll buy butter. 
[02:01:00]  You can buy it at the store.  We'll get butter and maple syrup, and it'll smell like horses.  Don't that sound exciting, Norton?  Why don't you do a show for the Amish?  They have to have a sense of humor, too, right?  They're very funny.  They have to.  They got great egg jokes.  Barn-raising jokes.  You know, I got to say, I thought we lost Brewer for good.  Because the last time he was in it, if you remember, we did the therapy with Brewer's mom.  It's a classic bit. 
[02:01:30]  Yes, man.  That was heavy.  Norton wasn't here that day.  It was real heavy.  We made your mom admit that she was hitting your dad.  Yeah.  She has no clue still that she really thought she was talking to therapists.  She still has no idea she was on the radio.  Yes, and I set up Anthony.  I gave Anthony way too much backstory.  Yes.  And we started going there, and I bailed.  I was like, oh, boy, this is getting bad.  You're like, no, your daughter.  I'm like, all right, you know what, mom?  Don't worry about it.  It's all good.  Yeah, I knew then. 
[02:02:00]  It was just like, all right, I'm out of this.  What happened?  You just got very involved.  You got very involved.  We didn't know how far we could take it.  It got ugly.  We took it far.  It got really weird.  She admitted that she hit her husband while he's in a wheelchair.  Right.  And in his bed.  In his bed.  I had to separate my parents.  You can't even write this in a sitcom.  She's 85.  She's blind in one eye.  Her one eye is sewed halfway shut because it keeps getting viruses in it because it's 
[02:02:30]  a dead eye.  So they had to sew it.  Now the kids don't want to see her because they're like, oh, God.  What's wrong with Nana?  Just play eye and seek with her.  She'll never find it.  So she's got her one eye shut and she's blind.  My dad's 88 and he was in a, he's trying to sleep his life away living with her.  Every time I go over there, she's sleeping.  Really?  And so the nurses that started coming and my sister would see marks and hitting.  They would catch him hitting once in a while. 
[02:03:00]  And then so one of the nurses said, hey, we're worried about your dad.  Your mom's hitting her and hitting him and something's going on.  So I had these guys call and she finally made it on the ring.  First she went, I don't know what you're talking about.  That was it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then she finally made it.  But now she's fine.  I got my dad and my dad's in my house.  Are they separated?  Yes.  Yes.  Now my dad never talks, but now that I have him alone, I'll say, hey, mom's coming. 
[02:03:30]  And he'll go from, uh, uh, to, oh, shit.  Jesus Christ, that bitch deserves to be alone.  Oh, wow.  I'll say stuff like that.  They're really separated.  Wow.  Like for like, their marriage is separate.  They're done.  Wow.  They're done.  How many years have they married?  How long have I been alive?  44 years.  Because back then you didn't get divorced.  You just fucking stayed with somebody.  You just stayed.  They're done.  Yeah.  My mom stayed with everyone. 
[02:04:00]  She got, she got beat, smashed, gunshot at her.  Wow.  Before your dad?  Oh, yeah.  Shot at her.  Oh, wow.  All that stuff.  Yeah.  She's crazy.  She's got a fucking lot of built up.  I was going to say, you're starting to think she might be a problem.  Yeah.  If all that happened to her.  Who knows?  I don't know where it stems.  It could be.  It could be, uh, you know, her first one died in World War II.  That was the love of her.  While she was pregnant.  And I think after that, she just didn't give a, she just didn't give a shit anymore. 
[02:04:30]  That was it, huh?  Do you know who the brothers and sister, like who was she pregnant with at the time?  Yeah.  My oldest brother who then died and that really crushed her.  So that was her.  He, when?  Uh, about 15 years ago.  So no, wait a minute.  Uh, like nine, yeah, like 1991.  So did he ever meet his dad or no?  No.  Never met his father.  She was pregnant while he was, he was supposed to come home.  He, he got killed by a sniper two months before the war ended. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  He's over there in, uh, what do you call it?  Luxembourg.  They have soldiers built, they have soldiers buried all over the world.  And Luxembourg has a lot of Americans there and Patton's there, which I, I'd even, I had no clue.  But he was under Patton for a while, which I, I didn't know, I didn't know.  So your brother was born, no father, your mother kind of.  Right.  And then her father died two years later.  She was, she swears it was from the mafia because he was a construction worker and he 
[02:05:30]  was building all this stuff and he started getting big.  And she said, those goddamn kidneys came to the house and I was a little girl.  And they said, if you don't join us, we're going to throw acid in your face.  Those goddamn kidneys.  I wasn't allowed to date kidneys.  And that's, it's true.  And she, she used to go to Irvine high school or Irvine Plaza or whatever over there.  And she said, one time I brought home a Guinea and my father, and I said, tell my father you're Jewish. 
[02:06:00]  And he said, he opened the door and my father said, what's your name?  And he said, Mancini.  And he said, get the fuck out of here now.  Go where you belong, you grease monkey.  And then two years later, he died of a heart attack.  How did the, the mafia give him a heart attack?  She, she swears it was through stress.  Ah.  It probably had nothing to do with her being, you know, having a kid and the kid's dead.  So after that, what happens? 
[02:06:30]  Does she marry someone else?  Here's, here's, this is great.  What happened after that is a mystery, little Jimmy.  After that, my oldest sister, you know, Doreen?  I think I've met her.  You might've met Doreen.  She's a complete mystery.  We don't know the father.  Oh man.  She has a mysterious thing on her face.  We, we have, she's a mystery.  So.  For real?  Yeah.  We don't know.  Does she know?  She says she contacted her father once he picked up the phone. 
[02:07:00]  And then they, she wussed out and there was no communication.  So after that came this other guy who was rich and he was huge in Pan Am and they flew  to, and he got transferred to, uh, Brazil.  So she was living in Rio de Janeiro and that's where the good stuff went down.  Where there was, um, fightings and knifings and, and shootings at my mother and beat downs  and, uh, all kinds of good stuff with his kids and her kids. 
[02:07:30]  And he had a kid and then they had kids together.  So she has Portuguese or Brazilian kids?  No, he was American.  He just got, uh, he got transferred to, uh, Brazil.  Do you know all of her kids with him?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  And they, they don't even, they don't even, if you say, if you mention him, it's like watching  a POW from, from the Philippines.  They just start shaking.  Just the ears start dripping water and sweat.  He's a terrible guy, huh? 
[02:08:00]  Horrifying.  Wow.  Which that effect is today, too.  Have you met him?  My sister's mangled.  Do you know him or no?  No, he's dead.  Oh, he's dead.  Okay.  Yeah.  My sister's 60 and still mangled.  I'm not giving a shit.  I didn't even, I was 14.  Patty, get off off the curb, please.  Holy shit.  Come on, you're 60, sweetie.  Come on, get up.  It's over.  Oh, wow.  You don't know the same, you don't understand.  You don't understand.  Yeah, it's a mess. 
[02:08:30]  Wow, still.  And then my dad came, who supposedly, he would drink heavy, but he wasn't an angry drunk.  He was a happy drunk.  He was a world, he just came out of World War II, so he was still drinking heavy for a  while.  And then they had me.  Now, she used to look for fights 24-7.  I went through a hate woman stage.  So, for a while, if you talked back, if you talked down to me, I would literally want  to take your head and shove it through a wall. 
[02:09:00]  Because my father would take it.  She'd go, those kids are stupid.  And they're not getting any of my goddamn money, I'll tell you that.  Oh, my God.  They're stupid.  You're stupid, Jim.  You're stupid.  Goddamn.  Shut up.  I work hard?  You're not getting any of my money.  That's all I heard for years.  And my father would just sit there watching, you know.  Quiet.  The goddamn news is on.  Hey, look at this monkey.  It's always the monkeys.  It's always the monkeys in trouble.  Always the monkeys from Brooklyn. 
[02:09:30]  Always cause them problems.  Here it goes through the Bronx, they just burn everything down.  That's what the monkeys do.  They burn everything down.  That's all they do.  That's all they do.  They burn everything down.  So that's, yeah, that was the upbringing.  It was awesome.  Wow.  Which led to your mom, you know, abusing your dad, and we got involved.  We haven't seen you since.  How long have they been married?  You're partial. 
[02:10:00]  44 years.  So I was in an accident, and they stuck together.  As my mom says, you were supposed to be aborted.  Everyone said, I'm an abortion.  You're 43, and you're going to die, Doris.  And I went to the doctor, and they said, that's just gas.  That's what she says.  It's gas.  And then I was dancing with your father, and I felt a kick.  And I went, oh, Jesus Christ.  This is a child.  And I had you, and I'm so happy I had you. 
[02:10:30]  They had some good times.  Wait, can I stop you for a second?  You know how long you have to be along to feel a kick?  That's what I said.  So she was pregnant for a really long time.  Dude, I grew up in a bar.  To this day, I can tell you most things I know about a childhood.  Right.  Now, I had a great childhood.  I'm not going to play.  I had a great childhood.  To me, it was fantastic.  Yeah.  But if you watch Goodfellas, like when they go to the bar, there was Tricky Dick.  There was Tricky Dick, Whispering Dick, Johnny Goons. 
[02:11:00]  I swear to God, there was Tommy and his poodle.  So there was all these, my dad would bartend, and that's, you know, after school, that's  where I'd go.  There were the characters.  And then my mom would come.  Yeah, it was great.  Do you ever do a one-man show?  I mean, I know you do your stand-up, you talk about your family, but a one-man show?  Because guys like Legos, I'm going to do them, and they're good, but this is all your family  and your real life story.  This would be an amazing one-man show. 
[02:11:30]  It would be funny.  Part of it would be heartbreaking.  Right.  If anyone should do it, it should be you, because you can do characters so amazingly  well.  Yeah, you might be on to something.  That'd be great, Jim.  That's where you develop your characters, going into that atmosphere.  Because I never give a shit about people's families, unless it's like you talking about  your aunt's dad or Ope's mom.  I like to hear the negative shit in families.  Oh, yeah.  And you have a great way of...  That's the fun stuff.  It is the fun stuff.  It really is, but you've got so much stuff, dude.  Who wouldn't want to listen to this for an hour?  I would watch this for an hour. 
[02:12:00]  I wouldn't even piss.  Fuck yeah.  I would fucking break, dude.  So Pops is living with you.  He's doing all right.  Yes.  Mom comes over every once in a while.  No, I've had her over the house twice, and the first time she came over, he played complete...  I have no clue who she is.  Oh, wow.  And he's there.  Yeah, he is there, and then he slips out a little bit.  He's there all day, and then he'll go, are we doing a show tonight in Florida? 
[02:12:30]  Florida?  Florida?  Huh?  Yeah, we're going to the Elks tonight.  I'm like, yeah.  Give me 20 minutes.  I wait for him to fall asleep.  But there's...  He's there.  Oh, so the first time she came over, he goes...  He goes, hey, you want to go to the show tonight?  For you, it's free, and you can bring your boyfriend.  And she's looking at him like, boyfriend?  You know who I am, right?  He goes, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, you're brought over on the other court.  So he told...  And we're all looking at him like, what is going on?  I...  100% he played it dumb as...  Yeah.  Dumb as a fox.  And so she came over on Thanksgiving, tried to hold his hand and stuff, and he wouldn't...  He just...  He wouldn't touch it.  He's trying to hurt her.  Shit.  He's probably pissed off.  Yeah, he...  Now that he's in safe...  The allies have saved him.  Yeah.  So now he's safe, and now he wants nothing to do with him. 
[02:13:30]  He's 88, and he probably...  Probably a lot of anger built up, and someone's not taking care of you because she's got anger  built.  You know, that's...  Right.  He's like, he wants to hurt her.  That's what he hurts.  Right.  Right.  You're right.  Where are you at with the movie you made with him, which I really liked a lot?  I'm looking...  I only sell it on the website, and I only sell it on the...  When I tour.  I'm going to look for a distributor this year.  I think I need a marketer.  Yeah, Brewer...  But I got to hit the baby boomers.  How old was he when you took him on the road?  85?  Five. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, Brewer takes his 85-year-old father on the road with him and filmed it.  Nice documentary.  It's really good.  You'd like it.  I'd love it.  You would like it.  Really good.  You would like it.  I met your dad.  Yeah, you did.  You're not far from there.  He's still young.  Your dad's young.  What is he?  60, maybe?  No, no, no.  He's 73, 74?  73.  Wow, really?  He looks great.  Yeah, yeah.  He looks great.  My pad's pretty healthy.  Wow.  He's still on marathons.  Another 10 years.  Another 10 years.  You'll see.  It'll get a little weird for you. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  And he starts shitting himself.  That's when the excitement begins.  I know.  That's going to be my book.  The top 10 cities my father's shit himself.  But, I mean, you want to promote the movie?  Yeah, no.  At least on your website.  I recommend it.  I love it.  I've watched this 500 times.  I've laughed and been touched every single time I watched it.  How long of a documentary is it?  70 minutes.  Did you ever, like, can you go to HBO with it or something?  I went to everyone and their mother with it.  No one wanted it? 
[02:15:00]  Really?  No.  I'm really surprised by that.  Showtime wants to do something for Father's Day.  But, you know.  Why wouldn't they want this?  Who knows?  How much footage do you have that you didn't use?  Oh, my gosh.  I have a mile and a half of footage.  Could you go to somebody?  Maybe re-edit it, right?  Maybe there's something that they were looking for.  Right.  Right.  And say, look, I have all this footage.  I'll work with you and re-edit it a little bit.  Call your manager.  I'll do it through him.  Call your agent.  I'll do it through them.  Or brewers.  I'm at the end of my room. 
[02:15:30]  I will call him manager.  He's got to, you know, yeah, I definitely will.  Or look at it differently.  Maybe start shooting again and then, you know.  Update what's going on.  Well, that's what I wanted to do, too.  Now he's off the road again and this is where we're at.  Right.  It's too good to drop.  It's great.  What year did you do this?  What's that?  A couple years ago.  What year was this?  Two, three years ago.  88.  2008.  So.  2008.  All right.  So that's almost four years.  That would be almost a logical update.  Yeah.  Get an update and add it to the movie somehow.  Is how your dad's doing now.  The whole thing about them. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Him moving out.  Jeez, that's a hell of an update, dude.  That might be what you needed.  You know what?  That is a great update.  Maybe refocus.  And even though you don't have the footage of that, play audio of some of the conversation  here.  Right.  Right.  And you put it over whether it's whatever kind of footage you have of them together.  You interview her.  You interview.  You're right.  I wouldn't give up on that.  There's the update, man.  You're right.  It's good.  What is it called?  More Than Me, I think.  More Than Me.  More Than Me.  That's a great idea, Jimbo.  You've got, you've just helped my career with two.  I'm doing a one-man show. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, right.  And I've got a new movie coming out.  Yeah.  I just think your family, the way you address your family is so different than I do.  I think it's so interesting.  Honest.  It's funny because I always wanted to write it either as a script or a book, but I'm kind  of waiting for some of them to die.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Because I'm embarrassed to put, I don't want to embarrass them.  Oh, my God.  We're on the same page.  You know what I mean?  I got a fucking book.  So that's, you know, like two, three years ago, I'm like, oh, if I would have put out  just my mother's life, it's the best HBO series you've ever seen in your life. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that sounds pretty fucking wild.  My brother describes a scene with when his father came home and first he looks for his  sister or his own daughter.  She's got the, they would go to bed holding knives every night from their own father.  Wow.  So he comes home and he's pissed and drunk about something.  He comes out by the pool area with a gun and he's taking shots at my mom in the pool. 
[02:17:30]  She runs to the, she runs to the street and around the car.  And he describes it like he starts shaking as a little boy watching his father go pow pow.  She's ducking behind the car.  Isn't that nuts?  That's crazy shit.  Did you talk to her on camera?  Who?  Your mom.  Oh, God.  She didn't.  Yeah, she'll talk about that.  But she, but there has to be a.  But there'll be a lot of denial, right? 
[02:18:00]  There's more denial of.  If you ask her about other stuff?  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  That's what I'm saying.  Of course.  I have to play both sides.  Every action causes a reaction.  Does it make sense?  So, you know, was she looking for money at that time?  And that's sort of that.  How can I get my.  And then he figured out this bitch is using me for fucking my money.  And was she cheating?  Like, I don't.  It doesn't excuse.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Attempted murder and all that. 
[02:18:30]  Attempted murder.  Very rarely are things smooth where someone just shoots.  It's usually two parts working back and forth.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, alcoholism.  You know, was he in alcohol?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  There's a lot of good stuff there.  Is there a way to get it out of her at all?  Like, I don't mean that in a, you know, just because she has all these stories.  Maybe she, you know, people get old.  They're more willing to talk when they're older.  They get them more.  Less consequences mean anything.  Well, it's just like I watched my dad last night.  We had a couple over last night.  And I've never heard him talk about the war so much in my life.  And it was a little boy. 
[02:19:00]  One of the kids, nine years old, sat down with my dad.  And I'm going, you know, hey, BK, you know, BK.  He's like, no, no, no.  I like old people.  And it's one of my daughter's friends.  And he's going, you know, what kind of guns did you shoot?  I was a gunner in the bottom of a belly.  And we shoot the planes going down.  I'm like, oh, wow.  He goes, this was weird.  I don't know where the kid got this.  He goes, what kind of bullets were they? 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  Ant, can you help?  Your gun got big, freaking like.  50s.  Whatever they were.  It was like four or five inches long.  And he goes, was it like this?  Like, where'd you get a?  Kid has a bullet.  He goes, I collect bullets.  Ha, ha, ha, he collects bullets.  He's in my house with bullets.  And he's like, no, I'm fascinated with old people and the war and what they went through.  It's kids, kids, eight and a half years old.  That's fucked up.  But he was talking to him as if, you know, he was on A&E biography. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  And then I went to Australia for leave, but I can't talk about that.  Let's just say for a pen, those monkeys would do anything.  And you didn't talk about your pain back then either.  That was weak.  Men didn't talk about that stuff.  No, no, no.  And all the stuff these old guys have to sit on, man.  Vietnam vets at least talk about it.  World War II.  Yeah, they're all, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:20:30]  They don't talk about nothing.  And they all helped each other.  My dad was garbage, man, but he had everyone in the town, his Valley Stream, everyone in  that town was from World War II and they all got each other jobs.  And they were all alcoholics.  And I just remember being little and literally one of his friends hung himself.  The other guy had a heart attack driving a truck.  He was 42.  And then one other guy died.  He's 44 and he had a heart attack.  His war buddies.  He was the only one that survived even after the war. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  You're like, good God.  But he would never talk about anything.  He was like, that's, that's kind of all part of the movie too, where like these, I don't  have patience for people like, you don't understand my life.  Like, oh yeah, really?  You got problems?  Let's go to the videotape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, please.  With your violin.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  So the only weird thing about him now is we have a nurse that comes in and there's two 
[02:21:30]  nurses and he's getting really sick, horny.  Like he'll, he makes a face like, oh shit.  Yes.  And it's, it's a little creepy and I have to constantly talk to him.  And then while she's sitting, he'll raise his leg and he'll try rubbing her leg and  he, he, he goes for quick feels.  Oh man.  So at 88, we're going to have to still deal with that shit.  Oh, Highland.  Fuck.  Hands down. 
[02:22:00]  Absolutely.  Knowing that, you know.  Absolutely.  Can't do much about it at 88.  You absolutely have to start filming again because you have time.  No, you're right.  And I started talking about that and the guy that filmed this didn't want anything to  do with it.  He's like, ah, these could have done.  I'm like, eh, I don't think so.  He thought what?  The guy that filmed the first half, he's like, eh, you know, I think it's kind of done.  I'm like, nah, I've been telling him for three years, let's do an update.  Let's do an update.  Absolutely.  Now's the time to do the update.  You should just film and then just figure out how to, you know. 
[02:22:30]  Do it from there.  Put it together.  How to wrap around it.  Yeah, something.  Jimmy, I love that project.  I do too.  Four years later.  I love it how it is and I'm really surprised no one has picked it up.  Really surprised by that.  Whatever it's missing, you can get either in the edit or now.  Whatever little piece you might need.  Dude, fucking Harry Potter got turned down by 40.  Like, sometimes you look at books that have been turned down.  Yeah.  40 fucking publishers or something or 20 and you go through so many of these big books  that were turned down.  I forget how long Chaz Palmitari shopped Bronx Tale for. 
[02:23:00]  Nobody.  Years.  Sometimes these things, we see them as finished products, but it's like, no, no, no, no.  This is a great play.  This is a great play.  I'm doing the main character.  We have Seth Rogen walking down the hall.  Nice.  He'll join us.  Yeah, absolutely.  Should I go there?  It doesn't matter. 
[02:23:30]  He's A-lister.  I'm like C-.  You're a pal.  Yeah, stay there.  Seth will be there.  You guys know each other?  Hey, I'm C-.  You know each other?  You know Seth?  I don't think he, no.  I don't think I've met him.  No, he's not on SNL.  He's a big actor.  He's a good dude.  He's a good dude, man.  Big actor.  He got skinny.  Yeah.  He did lose a lot of weight.  Jonah did, too.  They both did, I guess, at this point, right?  I mix those two up a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people do.  His movie's called 50-50.  It's supposed to be very good. 
[02:24:00]  I saw it.  I haven't even watched it.  It's very good.  I did.  It's great.  It's about cancer.  Yeah, he takes care of his buddy, and he goes to the ride with his buddy.  Yeah, it's a heavy movie.  15 minutes in, you're like, I don't want to see this shit.  But something changes, and you're totally hooked into it, and it's just a really good movie.  Okay.  Really good movie.  I like watching movies on planes that I want to hate, and then you're like, oh, wow, all  right.  This got me to Phoenix.  Which one?  What was the last one?  There was two.  One was the Steve Carell film, which I really- 
[02:24:30]  Did it with the schmucks?  No.  Oh, I hated that one.  Yeah, I hated that one, too.  I tried it a couple times.  Oh, God.  Because they had to be PC with the schmucks.  It was stupid.  It was PC's a-  The love.  The love one.  Addicted to love, or love something, where the poster was just these two legs.  Crazy, stupid love.  Yes.  That alone, I didn't want anything to do with the movie.  I know.  Exactly.  The movie's fucking great.  Really?  Hilarious.  It's-  Faggot.  It's great.  It's great. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I was-  Yeah, bring him right in.  Whenever I see a trailer for that, I'm like, no.  Me, too.  No, I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Yeah.  It got me to Phoenix.  Seth Brogan.  Hey, Jim Brewer.  How are you, man?  I'm great.  How are you doing, man?  You, too.  What's up, Seth?  How's it going, guys?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Just join right in.  I think we're talking about dysfunctional childhoods and all kinds of happy horse shit that went on.  Man, we just started discussing movies because I saw 50-50 two nights ago.  I fucking love this movie.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[02:25:30]  But I was telling Brewer, 15 minutes in, I'm not going to lie to you, and it'll sell the movie in a weird way, maybe?  Yeah.  I was like, I don't want to deal with this shit.  But then something changed in the movie, and I was completely hooked, and it's a great fucking movie.  It's about cancer.  It is about cancer.  And it's not a laugh out riot.  The humor's in it, obviously.  Yeah.  I mean, we wanted to keep it realistic and honest, I guess.  So, I mean, there's times when we were able to be very funny, but we didn't want to, like, you know, sacrifice the reality just to tell jokes.  Right.  And, you know, our buddy actually had cancer, so we had a pretty good blueprint for what the experience was like, and we didn't want to, you know, just fuck with his experience that much. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  He's a survivor, though.  He's alive.  He's fine.  You guys made jokes when he was going through the whole thing, right?  Yeah.  I mean, honestly, the whole time while he was going through it is when we would try to think of movie ideas about a young guy with cancer.  We'd always, the first one, we thought of, like, a fucked up version of the bucket list we'd call the fuck it list, about, like, instead of, like, going to India and racing fucking cars and shit, it was, like, two guys who, like, try heroin and, like, kill a hooker in Bangkok. 
[02:26:30]  All the really fucked up shit you want to do before you die.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Good to see you there.  Good to see you, dude.  Jimmy Norton.  I know him.  Of course.  We've acted together.  Yes.  Yes.  Although they cut it together.  We weren't in the same room.  I know.  Exactly.  I was shooting something else, I think.  It's a whole other movie, yeah.  And Bryce Howard's in the movie, Ron Howard's daughter. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  She was great.  She's great in it.  Yeah, she's really fun.  She was good in The Help.  God, does she play a bitch really good.  You're like, she was hateable in that movie.  I haven't seen that movie yet.  I heard it.  She's great.  She's great.  I heard it's really good, though.  And is the old Max Headroom guy, was he one of the cancer guys?  He was.  Matt Frewer.  Yeah.  I'm like, how do I know this?  And I thought it was Max Headroom.  Fucking Max Headroom, man.  I was too lazy to look it up, but I'm thinking, that's Max Headroom.  It is Max Headroom, yeah.  That poor bastard, still Max Headroom.  He was great.  He was still Max Headroom.  I'm sure he fucking hates it, but every time I was just like, so, Max Headroom, what  was that like to me? 
[02:27:30]  What was Max Headroom?  I remember seeing it.  Show of the future.  It was the 80s, right?  What was he supposed to be?  I never got it.  He was like a personality.  A futuristic.  Yeah, no, I don't fucking know.  I was like four years old when it was on, I think.  But yeah, he was like a personality.  He was in commercials and shit like that.  Yeah, he had a TV show, and I think he became just a virtual person because he had  that actually died, but his person being in consciousness was kind of put in a machine.  Like the lawnmower man or something like that. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, something like that.  Was it Cinemax?  As in Max Headroom?  No.  No, no, no.  His first name was Max.  Max Headroom was, it actually was, right before he died, he died in a car crash in the show,  and the last sign he saw was Max Headroom, like 12 feet.  So it was like a tunnel entrance or something.  You know a lot about Max Headroom.  I just know a little bit about a lot of things.  That's impressive.  He was a pop icon, though, for a while.  Yeah.  Everyone was into Max Headroom.  But anyway, he shows up in 50-50 as a cancer guy. 
[02:28:30]  He does, yeah.  He looked cancer-y.  He looked cancer-y.  That's what it said in the breakdowns of the auditions.  Someone looks cancer-y.  Well, we realize he also plays a cancer patient in The Watchmen.  He's like an old superhero with cancer.  So we're not the only guys who thought he looked cancer-y.  That's one of his things.  I still haven't seen The Watchmen.  No, I haven't.  People say it's a great movie.  It's pretty fucking good.  You got a kid, man.  You're out.  I am out.  Is that it?  I got a kid. 
[02:29:00]  The only time we see films is on, like I said, get me to Phoenix.  That's right.  Do you watch kids' movies, though?  Yeah.  Painfully, yes.  There must be some good ones.  Thank God for Pixar.  Yeah, right?  Thank God for Pixar is what I say today.  That's right.  I've seen every one of their movies 10 to 20 times.  And my kid's not even two years old yet.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, exactly.  Although they just graduated to like a Sherlock Holmes because there's no sex in there.  And they're not saying fuck you and all that. 
[02:29:30]  Kids are like, whoa.  It's just two detectives capping motherfuckers.  Yeah.  A lot of killing.  That does seem to be fine.  Yeah, that's okay.  A lot of people are dying in this bloodshed.  Dying fine.  Show a tip and I'm out.  Yeah.  There's going to be problems if there's a tip.  But once again, 50-50 is on Blu-ray tomorrow, I think.  The 24th, I think.  Oh, the 24th.  Okay, so a couple more weeks.  A couple more weeks.  This movie might get a few nominations. 
[02:30:00]  It might.  I think it might.  I think Will, who wrote the screenplay, has a shot.  That's our shot.  The writing was great.  The writing is good.  He's won a few awards so far for that.  So as frustrating as it is that he's never written anything else in his life and he's  getting more acclaim than I ever will in my entire fucking life, I think he deserves  every bit of it.  That's his first screenplay.  Screenplay?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's pretty impressive.  Some people.  No, I really like this.  The nerve of some people. 
[02:30:30]  Ben Chitter.  What was his name?  Will Reiser.  Here comes Will Reiser in the game.  He's the Brian Doyle of the Academy.  No one's heard of the kid, however, he's got some hot shots under his wing.  A neighbor drive on the first pitch!  The center field doesn't even look back!  Oh my!  Exactly.  If Brian Doyle had cancer, it would be exactly...  So, all right, enough about 50-50, I guess, but I want to make sure people see it.  I want to see it because I didn't know what it was and I got a copy yesterday, but then 
[02:31:00]  instead I paid two girls to suck my penis for a lot of money.  Really?  I felt that was the more important act.  I will.  That's pretty good.  To engage it.  I could always watch the movies.  You made the right choice.  Yeah.  The DVD I have.  Yeah, you have the DVD.  The two are connected because Seth's character uses his friend's cancer to try to get laid.  That's true.  Fair enough.  Which is a great little angle in the movie.  Absolutely.  The cancer kid's like a puppy.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  It speaks highly of you when you have a friend with cancer.  Definitely.  They think you're sensitive and that you'll take care of them someday.  Exactly.  You look nurturing and accepting of people's downtrodden...  They have no idea that you're bilking him out of his life savings.  Exactly.  Freaking stem cell lies.  That's terrible.  Were there any heavy moments on that?  Like when you're shooting a movie about something like that, were there any kind of moments where  people got uncomfortable?  Not really.  I mean, there's one or two intense moments in the movie, but it's not that fucking... 
[02:32:00]  No, it's not that weird.  Everyone's acting and everyone's...  Yeah, no one's like in character all day.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's not like...  It's none of those guys.  No, it's none of those guys.  I mean, I think like in some of the scenes, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays the main character,  like, yeah, he has to go to a pretty dark place emotionally and you can't just jump into  that sometimes.  But he's a normal dude to work with.  But how do you handle it?  They're getting chemo and they're eating like pot cookies or brownies or whatever.  Yeah.  And then he's got to leave the hospital after his chemo and he's laughing hysterically at 
[02:32:30]  all this horrific cancer shit on the way out.  Oh, God.  Which was brilliant, man.  Thanks.  One guy is obviously dead because they're wheeling him down to a level of part of the hospital  and he's just fucking laughing hysterically because he's so fucked up.  Yeah.  I like that scene, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  To us, that was like the blueprint for the whole movie, kind of.  We're like, if the whole movie feels like this, kind of, then that's a cool...  You're saying it doesn't go into a terms of endearment type move.  No, I don't think so. 
[02:33:00]  Although, that's brought up, too.  We bring up terms of endearment.  Oh, you do?  You have to nod to it.  Yeah, it's hard not to.  Just trying to prove to Seth I saw a stupid movie.  I'm sorry, Seth.  I totally believe you, man.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I have not seen it, but I mean...  Usually we fake this shit, but I actually saw this one.  Nicholson as an astronaut was very good in terms of endearment.  I want to somehow contribute to the conversation.  You definitely saw that movie.  You know he plays an astronaut.  I wanted a hero.  I mean, who...  Okay.  I usually have problems watching those types of movies. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Because I always think I'm going to, like, figure out that I have that.  Yeah.  I'm terrible.  I'm a terrible movie hypochondriac.  Right.  It happened years ago when I was a kid watching Brian's song.  I'm like, I'm running and I'm tired.  Shit!  I got it!  Fuck!  Let me...  My good friend Anthony...  Here's what Anthony is afraid of.  That the same thing will happen now that happened during Brian's song.  A little tear will come down and his father will yell,  Yo, faggot!  Quit crying! 
[02:34:00]  So he's convinced himself...  Maybe that, too.  ...that it's hypochondria when he's really just terrified of his crying.  Oh, is that of emotion?  Yeah, being sad.  Showing any emotion during a movie?  I love a good, sad movie.  Love it.  You cry like a baby, don't you?  I'm the fucking...  Really?  I'm a watch woman.  You love it?  I really am horrible.  Name one.  Name one.  Cuckoo's Nest makes me cry.  Cuckoo's Nest.  That's a great flick.  Tragic at the end.  It's a great movie.  Tragic.  I'm in the kid where...  Did you see Up?  Of course.  Did you cry it up?  Yeah, but why did you...  Did you cry it up? 
[02:34:30]  I'm fucking real, man.  We were just discussing this over the weekend.  Why did she have to have an empty womb?  They didn't need that part of the story.  That's to get you.  Yes.  Yeah, but you're talking to eight-year-olds.  Yeah.  Kids should know what an empty womb is at a very young age.  What the fuck?  Mlinger brought me in.  It's a cartoon.  Everyone wants to up that.  Yeah, the balloons.  Who's a guy?  I get it.  Eight minutes into the movie, I'm in the back of the game.  You're crying hysterically, yeah.  What kind of fucking movie is this? 
[02:35:00]  She was never able to have kids.  That's a laugh riot.  Right.  What the fuck?  Take every dizzy movie.  Kill the mother in the first scene.  Yeah.  It's true.  Immediately.  Emotionally fuck with you.  Yeah.  It's ballsy.  That was great, though.  It is ballsy.  They can fucking go for it.  I don't like that.  What's better than blubbering during a movie?  You can feel like a real person.  Listen, I love it.  I love it.  That's so odd.  It makes me feel so connected.  Like, I'm not so lost that I can't be connected.  What's the last, like, new movie that made you cry that you saw?  I don't know.  Crash makes me cry when I watch it, although that's a few years old.  Yeah.  Um, I'd have to think of the last movie I saw that made me, uh, the help did not. 
[02:35:30]  No.  50-50 might make you cry.  It might, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a chance.  But you enjoy that?  Love it.  See, I find it very uncomfortable.  Do you hide it?  No.  Do you just fucking go for it?  I don't give a fuck.  No, man.  I mean, I'm proving I'm harsh and...  No.  I'm salty.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I can catch a football, goddammit.  I cried through every episode of Lost.  I just did.  I don't know why.  Every episode of Lost.  In the beginning, as later ones. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, the first season made me cry.  I don't know why.  Just did.  Wow.  But I don't cry in other places.  I cry in weird...  I cry in weird things.  Like, some movie trailers will make me cry sometimes, when it's not even an emotional  movie, like a big epic, like, action movie trailer will, like, make me cry sometimes.  Just something where a good cut or a big stinger from the music kicks in, you're like, huh.  It gets me, yeah.  Where were you, ma?  Ma!  What about this new Tom Hanks movie?  That looks like it's gonna be a fucking movie.  That looks fucking depressing.  Fucking brutal. 
[02:36:30]  What's it called?  The poster's literally just a kid crying.  It's the most fucked up thing ever.  He loses his father.  The Twin Towers deal.  Right?  Yeah, he loses his father, but let's add Twin Towers loss.  Yeah.  Right.  He's in the towers.  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  And then he leaves behind a key, and then it's a treasure hunt type movie again.  Last fucking movie that made me cry.  Fuck that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll have to think about it.  God damn it.  Mission Impossible was rough at times.  Yeah, it really was.  Emotionally, it was pretty rough.  When they break that window, I'm like, oh, the cost.  It's going to be hard to fix. 
[02:37:00]  Do you hide it if you were, you know, do you hide it?  I think I might.  No.  When I cry in a movie, it depends how weirdly a place I'm crying in.  I think if, like, if it's a time when everyone's crying, then I won't hide it so much.  Even alone, I feel uncomfortable.  You do the rapid blink?  Like, you blink quickly because you feel like if you stop blinking, it's just going to pour  out, so your tears are kind of, like, being held back by your eye.  Like windshield wipers.  Yeah, fucking, like, little hummingbird wings blinking.  No, even alone, uncomfortable, with somebody, I can't even deal with that kind of emotional 
[02:37:30]  outburst.  Did you ever have it come down?  Like, here's what you do.  You sit your chick in front of you.  Like, you hold her head a little.  Like, you put your arm around her so she sinks down and she's watching.  Yeah.  And she can't look left and just see.  You're downstream.  Yeah, the non-man pussy that she's dating her.  I've never gotten to that point.  I could actually really, like, I would bite my tongue.  Just anything to stop it, to tamp it down deeper and deeper and deeper.  You've got to let some of that shit out.  Start bawling laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that faggot. 
[02:38:00]  Say something obnoxious.  Look at that still, baby.  Try to make a joke about it or something.  Yeah, fuck Schindler and his list.  It's a movie, you idiots.  It looks like a turtle shell in that crib.  It's not really a candy.  Oh, wow.  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  My mother told me that many years ago when I was a kid.  She's like, you will always say something obnoxious to push it away when you feel sad.  Yeah.  And then you stopped doing it at that age.  Oh, no, I still did it, but it's like, I'm more comfortable with it now. 
[02:38:30]  Didn't your chick at the time, like, make fun of you once when you were crying at a movie?  My ex does.  We're still good friends.  She just told me I'm a fucking, what a fucking baby.  She's a fucking, I'm like, you're a fucking mutant.  You're not a human.  She never cries.  Never.  We've watched everything together and nothing out of that fucking robot face thing.  Impervious, huh?  Nothing.  Nothing gets her.  Well.  She didn't care, though.  She's, you know, still just funny. 
[02:39:00]  Well, you know what happened to my family, Jimbo.  I'm just saying, stick with that girl.  You know where you're going.  Wheelchair bound and beaten.  Believe me, don't think I didn't think of that, that she wouldn't fucking light me up  if I was in a fucking wheelchair.  Yeah.  Fucking 50 years from now.  Yeah, absolutely.  Cry at a loss, you fucking queer.  I can't even, I'm trying to think of the last movie that really kind of got me and nothing,  nothing recently.  I mean, nothing, maybe an older movie. 
[02:39:30]  You know what?  Almost recently, it was an older movie, but I watched it recently.  And I was like, I think if I wanted to, I could.  Paper Moon.  That old movie, Paper Moon.  Paper Moon.  Really kind of got me.  And nothing, nothing recently.  I mean, nothing.  Maybe an older movie.  You know what?  Almost recently, it was an older movie, but I watched it recently.  And I was like, I think if I wanted to, I could. 
[02:40:00]  Paper Moon.  That old movie, Paper Moon.  With Ryan O'Neill and Tatum O'Neill.  It's black and white.  I don't have any recollection.  Didn't Bogdanovich do that one?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I didn't see that one.  That's good.  I don't know, but I'm going to make you fucking cry.  Yeah, it's, you know.  But nothing.  I just can't bring myself.  When animals die in movies, I get fucked up a little bit.  Dogs dying.  Sad.  Like a sad dog dying scene.  I watched like literally the end of Marley and Me and started crying.  And that was it.  Just the part when the dog died. 
[02:40:30]  I didn't see that.  No emotional investment whatsoever.  I didn't give a fuck.  I didn't know anything about this.  This dog could have been a fucking rapist.  And I was still just like blubbering at the sight of this dog dying.  It was terrible.  I assume it's not a rapist.  I haven't, again, have not seen Marley and Me, could assume it's not a rapist.  Yeah, I didn't see that.  I wanted to see it just for that, though, because I knew the dog died and it'd probably  yank a good one out of me.  It would, yeah.  So just get that part.  It was fucking brutal.  Literally, like the breathing is slowing.  Oh, man, that's brutal. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, it's fucking terrible.  It's little eyes closed.  It's like that.  Why put yourself through that?  You should, because it's human.  That's my school of thought.  No, it's not.  It's stupid.  Because when you're avoiding stuff like that now.  There's enough real shit in life to make you feel sad.  Yeah, but you don't cry at that either.  Well, I know, but I sound like I don't want to.  It's unhealthy to hold them.  Don't you see horrible things every day and you look and go, wow, that's terrible.  I'm sitting next to one.  I know.  Come on, bruise a guest. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what the fuck?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, man.  It's just to go out of your way, I think, to know that you're going to choke up at a movie.  Well, a movie takes you through an experience.  That's what you do when you go to a movie.  Yeah, but sometimes it is bullshit.  Movies can make you cry, I think.  I do love those Pixar movies, but I do remember seeing Finding Nemo and Up, and they just hit you.  It's like they've worked out a mathematical formula to make you fucking break down and cry.  It's like four minutes of establishment with one music cue coupled with a death, and you're fucking done. 
[02:42:00]  And that's it.  And you just know.  It's like they hit a button, and they're like, and now men will cry.  Well, it feels manipulative.  When it feels manipulative, I don't like it.  When it's natural, or when it's something like, oh, that was a great fucking moment.  When you feel like they're not trying to make you cry.  Yeah, when it's just, it's incidental.  What's your top comedy movies?  You're home with your gang.  You're home with your gang.  That got me crying when they had the little epilogue titles of what happened to the guys afterwards. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, Mr. Townley, how did you get in so much?  Never, never, never I say.  That's a good question.  Top comedies.  I think I like The Big Lebowski a lot.  That's one of my favorite movies.  Always goes back to that.  Big Lebowski's a biggie.  People love The Lebowski, yeah.  It's like really re-watchable, I think.  That's what's really funny about it. 
[02:43:00]  It's timeless.  Yeah, it's easy to watch.  That's a really fucking funny movie.  Used Cars, maybe.  I loved Used Cars.  Kurt Russell.  Jack Warden.  Fucking Fright McCray was one of the funniest guys ever.  Wow.  I loved fucking, I really loved Observe and Report.  Oh, thanks, man.  That fucking, I've raved about that movie since the day I saw it.  It was brutal.  It was nice to see a brutal comedy.  It's a really brutal movie.  It was great.  I love it.  We fucking loved that one.  Love it.  Thanks.  Because it was more honest than that dumb mall cop.  Yeah.  I thought something about Mary.  Oh, were you in Mall Cop, Jim Brun?  No, no, no. 
[02:43:30]  Sorry.  No.  I fucking hated that movie, and I tried.  Yeah.  Adam was in it.  45 minutes in, I still didn't laugh once.  And I'm like, why is everyone loving this movie?  I didn't get it.  I know.  It was the same with me.  That was confusing.  Family.  Family entertainment.  That was confusing to the Observe and Report team.  The kids loved it.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Observe and Report had a million laughs.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah, those guys are awesome.  The kids loved it.  Jody Hill and, yeah.  What did Ray Liotta say?  I hate your fucking guts!  You fucking faggot! 
[02:44:00]  Fucking great!  That really scared the fucking shit out of me.  Oh, my God!  I almost shat my pants.  Like, he really went off the fucking rails.  Yeah, he's a crazy dude.  We had a man, man.  I was intimidated by him.  Yeah, he's a little scary, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was just being Ray Liotta.  Just being him, I was intimidated by him.  That laugh, though.  Like, when you make him laugh really hard and then you get the full, like, Ray Liotta laugh,  that's, like, the most exciting thing.  That one he did in Goodfellas.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  And it's so, like, angry.  It's like an angry laugh.  It's like, part of it's like, fuck you for making me do this.  We have a bad day because we have the hoarder lady, too, now.  Good, she's good.  We overbooked guests today.  Ew, who else has done that?  She's a therapist on hoarders.  You want to touch on hoarders?  That show's fucking horrified.  Isn't it?  You want to have it?  It's fucked up.  Yeah, why do people do that?  I don't know.  She's coming in.  And every time I watch it, I get angry.  Yeah.  I just want to, I'm like, burn the place down. 
[02:45:00]  Burn the fucking place down.  But then they talk about if you do that, they'll just hoard new shit, right?  That's the whole thing.  I mean, with them in it.  They just start over.  It's like, I mean, kill them.  They should be hoarding salve to put on their wounds.  Why bother?  They just start over.  That's true.  They just start over.  I've been watching so many episodes and I just see this whole enabling thing.  But it's all because, like, their kids, it's all because, like, their mom threw out their  favorite toy when they were 10 years old.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Then they hoard shit.  And they hoard it.  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  My dad does that a bit. 
[02:45:30]  Like, there's a very clear, like, my dad's mom threw out his toys when he was 12 and he  fucking keeps everything.  Like, it's not like this, obviously.  Is he sloppy or is he neat?  He's neat about it.  Like, it's kind of organized in his way, but, like, you can tell that he doesn't like to  get rid of things.  He likes to, like, see all his belongings and little piles, kind of.  Wow, that's, yeah, that's a thing.  And it's so clear.  But he knows.  He knows it's all because his mom threw his shit out.  Like, it's not, like, subconscious.  He's like, oh.  Is that OCD, too, though?  Is it the same thing it is?  Yes, definitely.  It's got to be a combination of the two, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  There's definitely some, like, sense that something bad will happen if this stuff isn't like that.  I guess that's what makes it.  Yeah, it's like, what bad?  Here she is.  Oh, there you go.  How you been?  Robin's back.  Hi, how are you?  Robin.  Let's sit right there.  Or move her to the table.  Yeah, move her to the table.  Sit with all of us.  We'll bring him, like, get a goddamn chair and come on in here.  Get over here.  I'm scared.  Like having a, no.  You know Seth Rogen, too, right?  Hi, I'm Seth.  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you. 
[02:46:30]  How are you?  Jim Brewer.  Nice to meet you.  And Jim Brewer behind you.  Of course, the great Jim Brewer.  Hi.  Hey, how you doing?  Sam's putting a microphone up for Jim.  We have been, believe it or not, we're on the air.  I know.  People are driving to work, right?  Yeah.  They're driving, listening, I hope.  Listening to this shit.  Yeah, exactly.  You see Seth's movie 50-50?  I haven't.  Well, you better.  That's why he's here.  And it's a great movie.  We're talking about emotion and how men don't like to cry during movies. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, psychologists.  Fuck.  Yeah, you understand that.  Like, Anthony won't cry at a movie.  I'm a blubbering sissy.  Even alone, I feel like, don't do it.  Don't.  Don't do it.  What are you afraid of?  I don't know.  You tell me.  Come on.  Let's talk about it.  You're the doc.  You tell me.  I don't know.  Then it'll just never stop.  Maybe it'll just never stop.  Once that plug gets pulled, I'll be a wreck for the rest of my life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're afraid of someone to pour up.  I find it embarrassing.  Why?  It embarrasses.  I don't know why.  I guess the easy answer would be, you know, oh, well, obviously you must think it's not 
[02:47:30]  manly or something.  But that really isn't it.  I don't feel that part of it.  I just find it embarrassing.  You know, I have some time after the segment.  We could, you know, process it a little bit.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, that sounds like an offer or I'm a lunatic.  A case study.  Process.  Yeah.  It's a loss of control, too.  People are afraid of losing control when you're crying.  I know I'm not going to be a blubbering mess rolling around the house or something, but  you know, even just, I don't know.  I think it's because it starts making you question why you're crying. 
[02:48:00]  It's like, all right, it's sad.  I know that.  But what about it is so sad?  And why does that make me sad?  And then maybe it gets a little deeper into the brain than I really want to get.  Yeah.  Well, you know, when I'm watching something really sad and I don't want to cry just because  of the same reason, you just feel like it's all going to go, I just remember, like, it's  not real.  It's a movie.  It's not real.  What makes you sad?  Like, when you see, like, a neat apartment?  I'm going to go broke.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm not going to have a job.  No more shows. 
[02:48:30]  But it is real is what's fucked up because, like, the emotions it makes you think of are  totally real.  And I think that's why it's, I think that's why I know I don't like to cry in a movie because  it's obvious you're not crying at the fucking fish that got eaten.  You're crying about some other shit in your own life.  Right, right.  It resonates somehow.  It's tapping into something.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's got to be something there.  It's more intimidating just to break down and look around like, yeah, I'm crying.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You just don't want to, you don't want to be in that position where you got to start asking 
[02:49:00]  yourself why.  Yeah.  Why am I there?  That's why I'm asked all the time.  I'm like, oh, you fall asleep with the TV on at night.  It's like, so I don't have to be with my thoughts.  Yeah.  I don't want to delve too deep into, you know, my own psyche.  Memories.  Who wants to remember when a small boy, psst, wake up.  No, that never.  No, as far as I know, I don't remember it and I think I remember my whole childhood.  No, I had great other shit going on at the time.  But it's like, I just, I don't know, you think too much, you can't go to sleep. 
[02:49:30]  But I'm telling you, the mind is a dangerous place.  It is.  I'm telling you.  I know.  It's amazing.  And with, of course, you're here, Hoarders.  You're on Hoarders.  I was just watching you, of course, again.  And I know you've been here in the past.  So we've discussed it and I hate the way these people are handled with the kid gloves.  And, but you said it last time.  You go, well, people are constantly berating them and yelling at them to clean up the place.  And that doesn't work.  So we try the different approach. 
[02:50:00]  Now, I don't totally agree because a lot of the people I see on these shows, they're enablers.  They don't tell them, hey, clean this shit up.  They're like, okay, well, well, she wants to hang on to these things.  Like, I think someone's really got to take charge.  I do.  Haven't you seen me on the show?  Yeah, but you give them that, you give them that, like, all right, you're going to look through everything.  If there's, you make sure you look.  And I'm just looking at the house being a mess going, you can't look at everything.  There's too much stuff.  Well, that's true.  But, you know, I mean, I think you have to remember that we're there to avert a crisis. 
[02:50:30]  Like, we don't really think that we're going to clean up the house in two days.  Like, sometimes it happens.  You know, I recently did a shoot where, you know, basically everything did go.  It was just, you know, scooping it and throwing it in the dumpster.  But, you know, the reality is a lot of people who are compulsive hoarders do have some good stuff.  I think that we tend to think that it's all crappy stuff.  It's all garbage.  It's actually good.  I never even thought of that.  I never fucking thought of that at all.  I always assume it's newspapers and shit like that. 
[02:51:00]  TV guides and stuff.  Throw out these Joe DiMaggio rookie cards.  You're taking up to our space.  Okay, well, that would be good.  I mean, you know, in the midst of all of it, you do find some good stuff.  We just came back from Texas.  And, you know, there was a lot of good stuff there.  What was good that you found in some of the house that they had a lot of?  Hoarders should team up with American pickers.  Yeah.  Yes.  Drop off a cliff.  They buy the good shit and they fucking clean up all the rest.  Yeah.  I've noticed a lot of different kind of classifications of hoarder. 
[02:51:30]  I don't know if you put them in that.  But there are the hoarders that it is mostly clutter.  Uh, they're almost, you can almost consider it organized.  Things are stacked up against the walls and maybe class the containers.  Yes, the organized hoard.  Then there is the cluttered hoard where it's not stacked up nicely.  It's just all over the place.  But still, it is clothes and goods and things like that.  Then there is what I call the ratings grabber.  Here we go.  Like the dirty, like raccoon living in the fucking shower. 
[02:52:00]  There is human feces in the bathtub.  Uh, roaches now are making a big hit.  Roaches, if you could...  They're on a comeback.  They are.  Man, if you could open up a cabinet and have roaches just flying out of this thing, I am watching.  Wait till you see what's going to come.  Yes.  Are people getting grosser now that they see they're getting attention for it?  Um...  On purpose, right?  I don't know about that.  I wouldn't normally shit the tub, but...  I'm competing with the, uh, last lady. 
[02:52:30]  I'm telling you, this last place that I was at, it was unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  I mean, every time you scooped, they just ran everywhere.  And they were, and they flew.  They flew.  Oh, shit.  And they, for some reason, they always want to fly at your face.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, why can't you fly somewhere else?  And what do you do when you leave these?  Because you don't want to bring them back to your house.  Do you, do you have to, you gotta get them off of you.  So, like, a decontamination process?  No, no, I mean, it's not like they're, you know, I'm covered in roaches. 
[02:53:00]  You gotta get naked, is what you gotta do.  Make sure there's none hiding, right?  I knew, I knew what you were taking there.  How about bed bugs?  They scare me, too.  You don't want to go home with a bed bug in your pant cuff.  You imagine a pregnant bed bug in your pant cuff?  That's all I'm going to take, Jimmy.  That's the nightmare right there.  And it only takes one.  What's that?  I said, where do you get this stuff?  A pregnant bed bug?  Well, they have to somehow, but little bed bugs don't just crop up.  Bed bugs like the fuck. 
[02:53:30]  Right.  Have you, over the years that you've been doing this show now, it's been a few years, how many?  About two and a half years.  Two and a half years.  Have you noticed anything or done anything differently over the course of the years where  you notice, like, okay, I'm kind of seeing this happening more often and this is the best  way to deal with it?  I never know what I'm going to walk into.  You know, we get the pitch and we see pictures and then you walk in and sometimes it's a completely  different story.  It's worse or it's not as bad and it's always a crapshoot. 
[02:54:00]  You never know what you're walking into.  Do you, how they greet you with a smile on their face when they open that door, like  they're opening it to, you know, a palatial, beautiful mansion.  They're like, hi, come on in, hello.  And you guys are like, hi.  But they really don't think it's, they don't think it looks weird though anymore, right?  Like to them, it's like kind of normal, right?  You know, you guys see them in denial and I think that there's some reality of why they're  not letting people in their house because they know, like, this is a little out of control 
[02:54:30]  or a lot out of control.  You know, I mean, there's some level of awareness.  I really believe that, you know, people stay in denial because they're scared.  If you acknowledge there's a problem, then you have to do something about it.  I've noticed a lot of excuses going on with these people.  Oh man, just excuse after excuse.  They won't take the blame and put it on themselves.  And when they say that the most important thing to them is, and then they'll name a few  things, one of which should be, and sometimes it's their family.  They say, oh, my family, my kids are the most important thing in the world. 
[02:55:00]  Yet their actions show that their family is not the most important thing.  It's their collection of some, like, cookie tins.  Ceramic fucking penguin.  Watching soldiers.  Yeah.  Cookie tins.  Cookie tins.  Salsa lids.  I love my children, but where will I put my cookies without this tin?  You know, we talked about this last time.  I mean, you know, compulsive hoarding is a form of mental illness, period. 
[02:55:30]  At the end of the day, they got brain chemistry stuff going on.  And, you know, going back to your question, like, you know, people don't, you know, fill  up their houses overnight.  So it's like, do they see this?  Well, I don't think that they do necessarily because they're slowly bringing in stuff.  What about the people that live with them?  The enablers.  The enablers, yeah.  How about they notice and do something?  I've rarely seen a husband that I have any respect for on those shows.  I look and go, what are you doing that you allowed this to even get to this point? 
[02:56:00]  I think that one of the reasons why people don't take a stand is they're scared to death  because oftentimes people who are hoarding stuff defend their stuff so much and they  start using anger to get people to back off.  I don't know if you saw the show with Eileen where she blamed everything on the children  and the husband was a firefighter.  At one point, I'm like, you're a mandated reporter.  Like, you're living in this.  What's going on?  And he was so scared of her that he just couldn't take a stand.  Was she the heavyset gal?  That doesn't narrow it down on hoarders. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, okay.  I am always, it is amazing how a lot of the times they are from that same mold, a large  mold.  Hoarders tend to be a little more overweight.  Is it like, I mean, you say it's like a chemical imbalance, but then how come like sociologically  there seems to be so many similarities between the people that have this problem?  I believe that when you're living in an environment like that and you're literally stepping over  stuff and, you know, walking through goat paths, you're not exercising. 
[02:57:00]  You're not eating healthy.  You can't even cook in the kitchen.  And so you're bringing in takeout and, you know, you're not living in a healthy environment.  You're not taking care of yourself either.  You've got to roll around the house like a ninja.  How do they sleep with all the roaches scampering around?  That would drive me nuts.  I'm telling you.  I mean, again, wait till you see this episode that's going to air.  I, it was uncomfortable just standing there, let alone thinking about sleeping.  Did they crawl on you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, but it's, it's, it's, I, um, I can't, uh, do you hoard it? 
[02:57:30]  Cause your book is called, she wrote a book called The Hoarder in You, How to Live a Healthy  or Happier Uncluttered Life.  And I understand it to a certain, cause I clutter a little bit.  Like I say like celebrity stuff.  But I'm not, I don't have your guys' desk here, you know.  Well, this will be cleaned up by the, uh, the, uh, the intern.  This is good.  I can use this.  I can use this.  I need, the strap is fine.  So help me understand why you need goggles in your house.  Oh, that was, yes. 
[02:58:00]  We were doing prostate tests.  Those are my other 50 goggles.  I knew that was a mistake to go.  Oh, my God.  You never know what an accident will occur.  Oh, Dr. Robin.  No, this guy, Sam, is a bit of a hoarder.  And, um, he's a cheapskate and he's a bit of OCD.  He's a horrible chiseler.  And we made him break his shitty 12-inch TV today.  We broke it so he can get a 20-killer TV.  Well, explain to Seth.  It's a, it's a 12-inch Quasar from 1990, uh, what?  Good, 99.  99.  A 12-inch catheter ray tube. 
[02:58:30]  There's a 12-inch TV in it.  Guys, first of all, if he's a hoarder, you know if you broke his TV, he's going to keep  it still.  Because, you know, he's going to fix it someday.  Oh, that's true.  Someday he'll fix it.  You plan on keeping that TV?  I guarantee you, next year when I come back, he'll still have that TV.  He'll have a broken TV.  She's not that far off.  He didn't say because he couldn't because it was broken in here.  Well, Sam, explain your major thing you do to Robin.  Yes.  So she can read you.  Well, I have my wrestling collection?  Yeah.  Sam collects wrestling? 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  You were trying so hard.  Wrestling collection, yes.  He collects older gentlemen who hold them down.  He collects wrestling experiences.  Yes, and rest areas.  It's not just action figures, which he has thousands of at this point.  No, I just collect wrestling things and...  He has to tape every single wrestling show.  And then he puts it on DVD and saves them.  And I go, why are you saving these?  Like, you don't watch them.  I was just going to say, and I bet he doesn't watch them.  No. 
[02:59:30]  I don't have time to watch them.  I have to tape the next one.  I'm too busy fucking taping them.  Like, there's no reason for you to catalog these episodes.  But if he misses one, it really bothers him.  It freaks him the fuck out.  Wow.  I have a theory.  Sam's an asshole.  I concur.  That was a week.  Wow.  Clinically.  What's with this need to record every single wrestling, what, match? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, every show.  Every TV show.  When you were young, did your mom not let you watch an wrestling thing one day?  And then that's...  No, but like, I want to be able to, if there is a moment.  Because what if I miss, that's the moment that I miss.  It's always the what if.  But what about the internet?  Couldn't you go back?  That's what I'm saying.  If there's ever a good moment, if by some miracle something interesting actually happened  in wrestling, don't you think they would put it online to fucking commemorate the fact  that something interesting happened in the world of wrestling?  He doesn't want to acknowledge the internet, though. 
[03:00:30]  Well, no, you don't know when you can't get online or when you can't...  Why couldn't you?  Oh, my God.  What is this, 1990?  Yeah, why couldn't you?  My dial-up keeps cutting off.  Well, now he just broke his TV, so now he can't even, you know...  Well, that was to force him to get a flat screen...  To get a bigger TV.  So he went from a 12-inch to a 22-inch.  He got a 22-inch.  For 200 bucks.  It doesn't need to be over the top.  He's a cheapskate, though.  Why are you watching TV in the bedroom?  Why are you watching...  Oh, ooh, good point.  Ooh.  That's right. 
[03:01:00]  Meanwhile, that strap-on is still sitting in the wrapping.  Oh, Dr. Robin.  Sorry.  Oh, Robin.  You do it yourself.  Yeah, but what is it with hoarders and being cheap?  Like, this fear of running out?  What is it?  You know what, though?  You know, again, I know you're looking at the hoard of stuff and you think it's all garbage,  but people are going into serious financial debt, going out and spending and buying stuff.  Yeah, why, though? 
[03:01:30]  They don't need to.  Well, if it was that easy, then, you know, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about compulsive hoarding.  It does seem like when you talk to them that they do understand that there's a problem that needs to be remedied,  and it seems to be as easy as just throwing the crap away that you don't need.  I can understand them going, well, there's some good stuff here.  All right.  Pick out the good stuff.  But they're going through this cat urine-soaked box for a book that they had since the ninth grade.  And it's like, maybe you could let that go. 
[03:02:00]  It's like, there's roach eggs on it.  You're not going to read it.  Yeah, yeah.  But in their mind, someday they will.  It's sort of like the end here.  The someday, just in case.  You know, someday when he says he has a moment, like, really?  I think it's all a fear of death.  I think it all is like...  Is that what everything boils down to?  I think it is.  Yeah, I think you're right.  It's all like, I'm going to die one day, and what if I never get to experience these things ever again?  And so I'm going to have them around to make sure that this chapter isn't over, that it's not done with.  It's always available for me to go back to. 
[03:02:30]  Like leaving a legacy.  Yeah.  I'm more fascinated that wrestling still exists.  He's getting married as a fiancé.  That's embarrassing.  A very understanding.  That's way out of his fucking league, man.  We all see this as a problem.  Do you see this as a problem, Sam?  No, it doesn't hinder my life whatsoever.  Robin, talk to this numbskull.  What's the line between hobbies and fucking that shit? 
[03:03:00]  I mean, the reality is, if you have a hobby, you hopefully can do something with it.  But, you know, 80,000 wrestling episodes, like...  You've never watched.  Yeah.  You're not going to even get to it.  Yeah, but the passion for that wrestling is shared with everybody on the air here today.  You know what?  Someday I'm going to write a book called Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  If I have to count how many times I've heard that.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  I would buy that book.  Yeah But. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Hey Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  Hey Yeah But.  You don't understand.  Okay, it's two words.  Yeah.  It's two words.  Yeah But.  Yeah But.  And the little line under it could be examples of when people say, yeah, but.  Jimmy knows how to ruin a title.  But, you know, Sam, the news is, you know, we can do another episode with you, you know.  But when I watch Hoarders, I go, well, my apartment's not nearly that bad. 
[03:04:00]  I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure everyone who watches Hoarders says that.  Exactly.  Seagulls at the dump watch Hoarders and say that.  I'm sure the Hoarders who watch Hoarders are cussing.  The reason why his apartment isn't bad yet is because a lot of his shit is at his parents'  house.  See.  They're the enablers in this situation.  But his mother hoards things about him.  She has his creepy little Cub Scout uniforms.  She has his hair.  The therapist has a little lock of hair.  The entire hair from a haircut put in Tupperware.  Serious?  His mother.  Tupperware? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  It's crazy.  From when he had an Afro, what, when you were 20 or something like that?  Yeah, I was about 20 and then my mom cut it all off and then she saved it in a Tupperware.  I didn't ask her to save that hair.  That's her thing.  That's her picture frame.  So now he's putting his hoard on his mom saying, oh no, no, I didn't tell her to keep it.  See, the excuse, the yeah, but, all that stuff.  I bet you he wants her to keep it.  You think so?  I'm not going there.  I bet he does.  That means something special to him like Mommy Loves Me.  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't, in a sense, like if she throws it out now, she doesn't care like she used 
[03:05:00]  to.  Oh.  She doesn't want a fucking container of hair in her closet.  Yeah.  Yes.  She doesn't want to be reminded of something that sat on an empty shell.  She like, you know, put it on a little string and carry it around with her, you know, so  that she can, you know, have a piece of you.  Yeah.  You know, she keeps it all in the Tupperware, in the cupboard.  Did she ever explain why?  No, she has no explanation for why.  She can't explain it.  It's not an explainable thing, though.  I'll tell you right now why she does it. 
[03:05:30]  Why?  She fears that if she throws out the hair, she's throwing out a piece of him.  Right.  Right.  Well, she should have thrown out all of them.  When she first got the news from the doctor.  Oh, shit.  You're on your own.  You're on your own.  She just said, wow.  I've never heard her say that on any other show.  But ten minutes in here and, hey, you're on your own.  You know what?  That's not good when the doctor walks in a house and goes, you know what? 
[03:06:00]  You're on your own.  Yeah, you're on your own.  I don't even know what to do with you.  Yeah, yeah.  That is bizarre, though, right?  That his mom, they have this weird thing.  Like, you think you're throwing out a piece of, you know, it's bizarre.  So he's got issues, right?  Because he doesn't listen to us.  Look, we all have issues.  Well, sure.  But we're not focusing on us today.  We're focusing on us today.  Let's talk about your issues.  Oh, no.  It's okay.  He's got some good ones.  I do have some good ones.  I like this.  I got a mama issue.  Really?  I can help you with that, too. 
[03:06:30]  That's all right.  I, you know, I think at this point, we should do a group therapy, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I think at this point, you know?  Should do a group here.  Just hold hands.  Let's go around the room.  Mom issue.  Oh, please.  I don't even, everything.  It's too many to count.  Too many to count.  He has a fear of crying.  Yeah, a fear of crying.  Yeah, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm just embarrassed that, like, my genitals are just, like, freakishly large.  That's your cross to bear, man. 
[03:07:00]  It's an embarrassment of riches.  It's tough, yeah.  Do you just stay home and, like, write these things?  No, yeah, yeah.  You know, pull them out like, oh, yeah, this is a new one.  Okay.  No, I have plenty of issues, but I'm very comfortable talking about them.  I'm a sex addict, you know.  We all talk about them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you do, Robin?  I hoard sexual stuff, like, you know, all the photos I have from people.  Yeah, like, you know, a finger.  Jimmy's got serial.  It's called taking trophies, yeah.  He's got serial killer type files. 
[03:07:30]  But, like, just, like, porn and stuff like that, I hoard it for the same, like, stuff that I've watched.  I don't just go out and grab it, but I'm afraid of wanting it and not having it.  It's this fear of running out.  It's so stupid.  Well, you know, where'd Sam go?  Oh, there he is.  She's over there.  He moved.  He moved.  You know, you guys, I'm telling you, you're not far off the corner.  Avoid.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, there's, uh.  I feel like I used to be like that, and then I started just throwing everything out.  Like, I used to keep, like, every time I was in a magazine or newspaper, I would keep it,  and then I just, one day I was like, I don't want any of this fucking shit.  You'd be surprised.  I still do say that stuff, though.  I don't find that to be as crazy to, like, look at in 20 years. 
[03:08:00]  It's all online.  Who cares?  That's the thing.  You figure it's all, like, it's all online print.  I just started thinking, like, has there ever been a time I've been looking for something  and not had it or not been able to access something?  Like, I just, I couldn't think of one time.  I was like, oh, it'd be great to read that fucking Rolling Stone article from six years ago,  but it just, and if I wanted to, it's probably online somewhere.  Yeah.  It's there.  It's there.  Like, every wrestling event that's ever occurred in the history of humanity.  Here you go, Sam.  Sam.  You could watch Coco Beware wrestle on the internet right now if you wanted to. 
[03:08:30]  You know, your point is actually spot on, because the reality is, is once these people  throw that stuff away, they're not obsessing like they think that they are, and that's  why they can't get rid of it, is they think, oh my gosh, if I give this up, like, I will  forever regret it.  I'm going to be in this, like, insane anxiety state, and, you know, what if I want it and  I can't get it back?  But it's all OCD, though, isn't it?  Like, isn't it all a form of, like, as far as, like, it's all roots to the simple problem 
[03:09:00]  of, like, these people think something terrible will happen if they do something that is incredibly  normal.  Are you asking me or the doctor?  I'm asking, I don't know, I'm just going to put it out there.  But is that what it is?  I mean, is it all...  A little sensitive, aren't you?  Another problem.  That was me being arrogant, thinking I'm on the same intellectual level.  No, but is it?  Is that what it is?  Like, is it all the same thing?  Like, is someone who thinks they have to touch a light switch five times before leaving  a room, do they have the same problem as someone who has every fucking, you know, episode of...  At the end of the day, it's all fear. 
[03:09:30]  It's all fear.  Fear, you know, if you don't touch the light switch five times, something bad is going to  happen.  It's all something in their brain saying something bad is going to happen.  Exactly.  It is a chemical thing, though.  It really is.  It really is.  You know?  Unfortunately.  I think...  So there's no way to fix it through talking, like, so then is there any, like, unless  you're medicating people on hoarders, but you aren't, is there any point to, like, that's  the question, like, since it is a chemical imbalance, is there any point to doing anything  other than medicating these people?  If you look at anything that you're afraid of, the only way to get over it is to go through 
[03:10:00]  it, right?  We can talk about it all day long, but until you face your fear and test out if what you  fear is going to happen, you never know.  You just stay scared.  But does that actually change the chemical makeup?  It does.  It does.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  Is it a case of you can't think yourself into good action, you have to act yourself into  good thinking?  Wow.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, Jimbo.  I'm just going to share with that.  That's the title of my book.  I like that.  Oh, God. 
[03:10:30]  The title of my book is, I like the definitions of a buttfucker.  That's the underline.  That's the underline.  That's the underline.  That's the underline.  That's the underline.  Yeah.  But it's spelled B-U-T as in an aside.  What?  Bunker.  Wow.  Wow.  That really is.  What?  You can't answer the question, and I'll see.  I don't think some of the collecting or hoarding is just based on a fear that something bad  will happen if you get rid of it.  Because I know I've collected over the years a lot of electronic or computer stuff and thinking, 
[03:11:00]  I might use this at some point, knowing that in a week it's dated.  And the reason I pulled it out of the other computer and put it in a box somewhere is because  I got something new anyway.  But I'd always hold on to it going like, I must have had like 50 graphics cards over  the past 10 years put in boxes and stuff, knowing I'm never going to use it.  I have all this old computer stuff because I'm convinced if something goes down, this is 
[03:11:30]  going to...  Everyone's going to save us by all this old stuff.  Like, does anyone have a 1972 computer?  I do, fucker.  I do.  That's how you win the movies.  That's how we beat the robots.  Only people with DOS prompt will live.  Yeah.  I didn't think I had one.  Now I just realize, you're getting all this old electronics.  And I swear, it's because when it all goes down, I'm going to be able to save everyone.  That's crazy.  I'll stick to guns when it all goes down. 
[03:12:00]  Like, glue with something.  Yeah, I think that was right.  You guys are wondering, how could people do this?  And so far, all of you are hoarders.  Everyone does it.  Yeah, to a point.  I think every single person is to a point.  Like, we all fall on the continuum.  Thank God.  We can correlate in some way to the difficulty of letting go of stuff.  Thank God I'm wealthy enough to have Mexicans come over every week.  The hoarder in you.  This is what happens if your uncle is a hoarder. 
[03:12:30]  The hoarder in you.  Dr. Robin's just shaking her head.  It's the sequel to The Hoarder on you.  Every time I'm on, I go, what was I thinking?  What was I thinking?  What was I thinking?  You know?  I'm thinking this time it's going to be different.  We try to let enough time pass where maybe you'll gloss it over as something memorable and fun.  Are you just addressing hoarding that's not as extreme? 
[03:13:00]  Like, that's not as much as regular people hoarding?  It's like what they call pack ratting, right?  Is that like, what happened to that term?  That went away now.  I think it's kind of gone away and it's been replaced.  With hoarding.  The show on A&E Hoarders has blown this condition wide open.  You know, we've got copycat shows, but the reality is everybody can relate at some level.  You know?  Of course, you read the book, so you know.  Oh, please.  I did read it.  I enjoyed it.  Cover to cover.  In the beginning, you know, I talk about that makeup drawer. 
[03:13:30]  And it's only, you know, so wide.  Six inches by 12 inches.  And I've got a little container of makeup from high school and college that I hold on to.  You know, black eyeliner, that kind of stuff, none of which I wear now, but I go, you never  know.  Someday.  And it'd be wasteful to go out and spend 15 bucks on eyeliner.  So I keep it.  Even though there's no way in hell, I'm going to put that on my face.  Right.  But I still hold on to this.  You could just go to Sephora or go to the makeup room on Hoarders and they would do it  for free. 
[03:14:00]  I'm kidding.  But you know what I'm saying?  They have a makeup person.  But you know, it's all on a continuum, you know?  The other thing I'm known for is my, you know, 200 pairs of shoes.  But you know what?  I can access every single one of them.  They're all lined up.  Oh, well, then that's totally fine.  That was a lot of yeah, but to me.  That sounds like a yeah, but.  Yeah, but I can access it.  I can access the body.  Yeah, but I can access it.  Yeah, but I can access it.  I can access the body.  I can access the body.  I can access the body.  I can access the body.  I can access the body.  Sure, sure.  Identify.  Don't compare.  It's the difference between someone who just has a big collection of shit and a hoarder. 
[03:14:30]  Right.  Yes.  That's right.  If your closet is big enough.  Exactly.  If these people had 30,000 square foot homes, they wouldn't be hoarders at all.  People with a lot of shit.  In a small place.  That sucks.  That's the difference.  Well, I can look at all of my shoes.  I've got a big closet.  Yeah.  The square footage has disqualified you from hoarders.  I would love to be able to grab a few pairs of your shoes and say, look, how would you  feel if I threw these away? 
[03:15:00]  You're not getting my shoes.  If I threw these away, anxiety level between one and ten.  How anxious is this making you?  And more accurately.  You're not watching me in action.  Oh, I love it.  I love hoarders.  I'm like, what's up with that?  Hoarders is great.  And then the question, how would you feel if he put them on and pranced around the house  and felt pretty?  Now the anxiety level has to go up to 20, 30.  Like I said, he's not getting a hold of my shoes.  No.  Wow.  Why do you have so many pairs of shoes?  I love shoes.  How often do you wear a different pair?  Like, when's the last time you wore those boots? 
[03:15:30]  In the roach house.  There's bedbugs nesting in it.  There's no bugs nesting in my shoes.  There's bugs in her shoes, Jimmy.  Nice host.  There might be a bedbug in there, right?  I'm sure there is.  A pregnant bedbug.  There's fur.  I do see fur.  Yeah.  Boots have dandruff.  Rampant breeding grounds.  Nothing makes those things horny or dead.  Fur's an aphrodisiac to those fuckers.  They can't believe someone was dumb enough to walk in with something. 
[03:16:00]  They're like, we haven't seen one of these in five years.  Hop on, boys.  Like a train coming in here.  We're going to shoe town.  If they're living in my shoes, you know where they're living when I leave here.  Uh-oh.  Right here.  This place is infested.  We'll just fight with the other bugs.  I want to leave you guys with something.  Yeah.  Some bedbugs.  Cockroaches.  Something to remember you by.  Yeah.  Hey, does this happen in other countries, this hoarding thing?  It's all over.  It is?  It's all over.  So it's not just the United States in general?  No.  No.  I don't know. 
[03:16:30]  I mean, the reality is...  There's assholes all over the world.  Comet Rouge and their skulls.  Yeah.  Paul Pott was hoarding bodies.  I mean, I don't know.  You know?  Are there hoarders in Ethiopia?  I don't really know because I've never been there.  How about you go there with the show and then find out?  Hoarders International.  Yeah, let's do this.  I see it now.  Let's do this.  I see it now.  We are so talking about it.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  I mean, we've been up to Canada a few times.  But, yeah.  We got hoarders there?  The reality is, again, you know, I've got to stress, hoarders blew this whole thing  wide open. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, so many people are sitting in silence.  So when you say, you know, how many hoarders are there?  We have no idea.  You know, estimates are 3 million, but we actually think it's closer to 7 million because, you  know, who opens their door and says, you know, come on in?  And, oh, by the way, my children don't have a bed to sleep in.  And, you know, but...  It's that house that has the curtains closed all the time.  Mm-hmm.  They put the newspaper over the little window on the door.  Their lawn's a little long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You all have one in the neighborhood, don't we?  You kind of think maybe someone's cooking up some crystal meth in the neighborhood when  you walk by their house?  I don't know what smells like cat urine. 
[03:17:30]  Hey, are you doing any book signings?  Not this trip, but I'll sign your book.  Okay.  I want to pull.  I want to work because we're wrapping up soon, I think.  We have a couple minutes.  I'm fine if we have time.  I just want to make sure everybody's plugged in.  I don't know who has to go, so...  All right, well, all the time.  Wherever it goes, goes.  Seth is plugging 50-50, which is on Blu-ray January what?  24th, I think?  Is it on demand or something now?  Because I've heard this is great.  Yeah.  And I just want to jump in again.  I did see this movie two days ago.  I loved it.  Thanks.  Fucking loved it. 
[03:18:00]  Loved Seth's performance.  The writing was amazing, and there's definitely laughs in there.  A little different look at cancer.  And I think it's going to be up for some awards.  Thanks.  Oh, look at you.  Fuck yeah.  Seth's an animal.  I am.  He is.  It's an animal.  Can you feel it coming off of me?  Let's tie it all in.  Somebody was hoarding cancer cells.  Is Seth promoting anything else?  Not really.  Don't you have a charity? 
[03:18:30]  I am.  Actually, yes.  I'm in a charity competition.  I'm getting beaten by Jonah Hill and Ed Norton, which is fucking humiliating.  So, go to crowdrise.com and donate to my charity page to help me beat those guys.  Very cool.  What's the charity Crowdrise for?  Well, it's like a social network for charities, but I work with the Alzheimer's Association.  Okay.  Awesome.  And Brewer, just so you know, Jim is the great Jim Brewer, doing the Heavy Metal Family Man  Tour.  It's the Highline Ballroom, which is on 16th Street here in Manhattan. 
[03:19:00]  It's this Friday night.  Go to HighlineBallroom.com or just call, if you're not near your computer, 212-414-5994  to see Brewer.  And I'm not going to plug all my dates.  Just go to EatABullet.com.  I have Poughkeepsie, Tempe, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Rochester, and Toledo coming up.  But you're not promoting.  No, I'm just going to mention the cities.  You're not promoting.  That's not promoting.  Absolutely.  Screw it.  And the book, once again, for Robin, who's always a great guest.  It's called The Hoarder in You, How to Live a Happier, Healthier, Uncluttered Life. 
[03:19:30]  Very odd, with the clutter of words.  The irony is so thick, you can cut it with a knife.  It's a long title.  It's a very long title.  It's a bloody word.  You are.  You are.  And it's a nice little book, and I'm going to read this, because I picked it up, and  like I said, I wish I would have read this.  It looked very good.  And the show on A&E, Monday, 9 p.m.  It's fantastic.  I can't get enough of it.  I can't get enough of hating the people I see on it.  I have no... 
[03:20:00]  I just have no patience for it.  I yell.  I tweet all the time.  I'm tweeting during the show going, burn it down!  Burn it down!  That's just a horrible person.  I know.  I'm telling you.  It isn't.  You've got issues.  I do.  I know.  Thank God, you know, that's what got me this program.  All of my issues.  But he tries to laugh it all away.  Oh, yeah.  And it's like they say, thank God I can laugh, but don't let me forget that I cried. 
[03:20:30]  Jimmy is despicable with his shit.  Fucking fortune cookies.  Well, you know, guys, I mean...  Jimmy's little sayings.  Oh, man.  Is that an adage?  I think that's an adage.  It sure is.  An adage.  It's an adage.  Always grabbing for more than our share.  I understand.  Yes, yes, yes.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Sure.  All right.  Thanks, everybody.  And I'm grateful you all came in.  Yeah.  Can't have what I want.  Please let me want what I have. 
[03:21:00]  I'm not a adage.  I'm not a adage.  I'm not a adage.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We're on. 
[03:21:30]  Roll in.  Opie, I went over there and pushed my own button.  But feel free to push yours.  Well, Roland, Opie has to push your button, too.  Opie's still sitting here.  What a great show.  Seth Rogen.  How are you here?  Jim Brewer.  Dr. Zazio.  Opie, are you going to turn on Roland's mic at least?  You're going to have to at least acknowledge my presence.  There you go.  You're not going to turn yours on?  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank God.  This is Ants.  Okay.  We'll see you guys later. 
[03:22:00]  It was a fun show.  It was.  Were you nervous that the three of them wouldn't mesh as well as they did?  What?  I don't know if nervous is the right word.  Nervous about what?  The three of them meshing them as well as they did.  I was saying mesh.  He asked me to repeat the question.  But he didn't want to hear mesh again.  Well, then he should have answered the first time.  You're a real mesh of something.  Chip piped in for a second during that interview.  He did?  Yeah, in the last segment.  I didn't hear it.  Just for a second.  Over the laughs. 
[03:22:30]  Chip piped in.  I don't remember what it was.  I don't remember either.  But I remember you made your presence known.  How great was that today?  You had Seth Brewer, Norton.  Just killing it.  Well, Jim Brewer is such an interesting...  Jim can talk about anything for any length of time.  And I can listen.  He's a great storyteller.  I told him to come back.  Because we didn't even get to really get into half the stuff he wanted to.  Yeah.  Everyday Jim wants.  You know, Roland, you did your job too good today.  I'm going to tell you that much.  Too good.  It was overbooked.  Yeah.  There was too much going on.  Does that count as a dick in the ass? 
[03:23:00]  No.  Okay, good.  No, that's because we had Seth Rogen at 8.30, but you know he could easily do an hour.  I mean Brewer.  And then you had Seth at, what, 9?  9, yeah.  And then you had Robin at 9.30.  That's crazy.  But then Seth got here and Roland was like, Seth can just hang out for as long as you want.  And so everybody had a party together.  Yeah, but Robin's show and what she is an expert in is so interesting.  Like there's nobody that can't talk to her and ask questions.  Everybody knows somebody or we all collect shit.  Like there's always, she could mix with anybody. 
[03:23:30]  But it looks like she collects herself.  And that's why she makes this whole thing.  There was no way, because I could have said my wrestling tapes are in, you know, date order or something.  Or I know where they are.  Just because she has 200 pairs of shoes that she can find doesn't make her 200 pairs of shoes legitimate.  You date every tape?  Yeah, how else am I going to know what's on it?  Wow.  I record the DVD and write what date.  Raw from December 16th.  I think it's me and Norton's job now to get you out of your comfort zone.  There's too much going on, Sam.  You don't need this crap. 
[03:24:00]  You're going to wreck your marriage.  You're going to wreck your marriage and your life.  You're going to get a hot chick.  We're going to get you out of your comfort zone.  It was a good sign that you brought your TV in today, because I know that was a big deal.  I lost a bet.  But this wrestling thing, we've got to get you out of that, I'm telling you.  Right.  You can still love it, but you're not.  He's also afraid of abandoning his childhood, and I relate to that too.  Because what happens is once you become a man, that part of your life is done.  And it's scary to lose that part of your life.  You're like, I can't stop watching wrestling.  It makes you an adult.  I used to obsess about collecting baseball cards. 
[03:24:30]  Obsessed.  Like, I had to have every single fucking baseball card out there.  And then one day, I just let it go.  And it was freeing, because now I don't have the stress to worry about it anymore.  You throw stuff out all the time, though.  You throw stuff out that shouldn't be thrown out.  I know.  It drives Lindsay nuts.  You just throw out things.  I throw out a lot of stuff, because, you know...  You don't want to hoard it?  No, I don't.  But that goes back to being a radio guy.  Like, I had to move to places, and I could only take what was...  You know, I could fit my car. 
[03:25:00]  So I still have that mentality.  You have to know that you're an established person now.  You have this wonderful Manhattan apartment.  What did I throw out that I needed to keep?  Well, I'm not picking through your garbage.  Well, nothing in the end.  But I know you don't...  In the end, you realize you only need just a few things in your life.  A couple nice shirts, a couple nice pairs of jeans.  Yeah, but you only need 22 inches of television.  A laptop, a camera, and a phone.  That's all I need.  You're more of a minimalist, though.  You're that guy, like, you don't need...  My mom is like that.  She doesn't save everything.  My father and I save.  My mom doesn't.  You're like that.  I save important stuff, like birthday cards and things like that. 
[03:25:30]  My mom saves everything.  But, Sam, it's not about me today.  It could be about me tomorrow.  Here's the deal with you.  Like, you're a huge wrestling fan, so keep your action figures fine.  Keep your pictures with the wrestlers fine.  Keep anything wrestlers signed fine.  Get rid of the stupid tapes, though.  It'll be freeing to you.  Or keep them and just stop taping it.  Right.  Put them in a box somewhere where they're not an important...  And even the wrestling figures, you could save them, but you could put some of them away  and still have them in a closet in the box. 
[03:26:00]  It's almost like you're not denying that part of your life, and you're not leaving it alone.  You're just making a little bit more room.  Because someone asked, I think, Seth, when does it go from collecting stuff to a problem?  Right.  The problem with you is collecting the wrestling shows.  Everything else, I think, is fine.  Yeah.  But, I mean, that's what I like.  I like wrestling tapes.  You don't like them because you don't watch them.  But I would.  I have watched some of them.  I have watched every single one.  All right.  Look.  Every once in a while, when you do watch a wrestling tape, I guarantee it's on the internet. 
[03:26:30]  So, all of a sudden, something pops in your head, like Seth Rogen said today, Coco Beware.  I think it was him.  Yeah.  You could go see that right now on the internet.  Yeah, but I can't see complete shows.  Right.  And I understand that desire, too.  But even those are available on YouTube.  And in the coming years, will be available everywhere.  Because you can see with commercials and everything now.  I also don't like just checking something on the internet and relying on other people to upload it.  And then you have to rely on someone else to host it. 
[03:27:00]  I used to hate when I'd watch, like, Aussie concerts, live concerts, where they would do fancy stuff.  I just wanted to see the whole stage as is so I didn't miss anything.  Like, if they went to the guitarist, I'm like, I'm missing something Aussie's doing.  It is this irrational fear of missing something.  And it's so stupid because the moment where you need all that shit never comes.  And even if it does come, let's say that moment comes, being bummed and not having it is not nearly as bad as the torment of worrying about it. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  The worry you got to make sure you got everything taped, it's not worth it.  Well, I mean, I don't feel like my life is being hindered at all.  Yeah, but you misread your girl on that TV thing.  You live your life your way.  What are you getting mad at me for now?  Like, I'm doing it to you.  Just live your life any way you want.  I'm not even in your house.  That's fine.  See, but you also, because of...  Don't make it about me.  Well, you have your own issues.  Don't make it about me another day.  You have your own issues.  Oh, really?  Like, I haven't talked about it on the show?  Of course I do. 
[03:28:00]  But that makes my issues a bigger issue to you.  No.  No, I won't even think of your issues as soon as I leave the studio.  I'm making radio for the people.  You shouldn't.  I will.  I do worry about you, though, Sam.  Because you can nip this in the butt before it gets crazy.  Yeah, you don't want your...  Which we all do, because women are kind of hard to read sometimes.  Sure.  But that shit set off an alarm bell.  Like, my way of seeing things is not what I thought.  It's not terrible.  It's stupid.  But sometimes little things happen where it's like, fuck, man.  I am not reading the room as well as I thought. 
[03:28:30]  Like, these really weird revelations we have.  Yeah.  I do have to bring up something else.  Sure.  What's that?  You hear about Tony Iommi?  What?  He's not dead, but he has early stage cancer.  No.  Is that true?  Did you hear that?  I'm not sure if it's true, to be honest with you.  Oh.  But it came in.  And then I tried to look it up on Twitter, and I did see a few other tweets about it.  I did not hear that.  Oh, no.  Fat Matt in Sparta, New Jersey.  Sorry that I said it that way, but I was going to try this thing.  No, that's fine.  Ask Jimmy if you just saw the news that Tony Iommi has early stage cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
[03:29:00]  Is that the treatable one?  Yeah, it's up on Billboard.  Is it confirmed?  Is Hodgkin's lymphoma?  Hodgkin's is a motherfucker.  No, but non-Hodgkin's, I think, is the really bad one.  Non-Hodgkin's is bad?  I think that's the really bad one.  It just says lymphoma.  Early stage.  Oh, dear.  So maybe he has, maybe Ronnie getting stomach cancer got him to go.  Who knows?  I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, they're not really stating.  A couple of these articles just say lymphoma. 
[03:29:30]  They don't say if it's non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's.  I'm looking.  Early stage is always good.  All right, I'm going home.  All right.  People survive stage four stuff.  I know people with stage four shit that wound up being okay.  Well, good luck, Tony Iommi.  Fuck, man.  I hope he's okay.  And Sam, good luck with the after show.  Well, you guys had a great show today.  Just keep denying you don't have issues.  He knows he does.  Well, I didn't say don't have issues.  I said they're not hindering my life to the point that I need to worry about them. 
[03:30:00]  I still love you, though.  I appreciate that.  I don't love you.  Why not?  It's more lust.  It's just purely sexual.  Do you hug?  No, no, no.  Want a hug?  No, I don't want it from you.  Why don't you two hug each other?  All right.  Open gym and just hugging.  See, I'm even getting them like a really nice one.  Yeah.  And a couple pats.  All right.  Well, you guys.  Come on over here.  No.  You got to do it like this.  You got to do it under the waist.  Will you put your arms around him? 
[03:30:30]  He's holding me by the lower waist.  And I reached under his waist and I cupped his liver and upper back as one would a lover.  You're another guy that doesn't like being touched, huh?  Well, that's not like that.  That's bad touch.  How about the handshake hug?  Are you good with that?  It can't happen, but now it's weird.  It's all awkward now.  I'll show you how you hug for real.  Like a regular man.  I'm not going to attack you.  I've been hugged before.  Come here.  Like this.  Come here.  Okay.  You put your arm like this.  You do the man hug like this.  And you... 
[03:31:00]  Come here.  Hug me.  And I'm doing this.  And then you touch and you hold the back of the hair.  That's not what you do at all.  I reach back as we do like the man hug, which is lower and upper.  And I held the back of the hair.  The poof.  I was just worried that you were going to start thrusting your pelvis inwards.  I'm oddly comfortable.  And we all know what perversions I've engaged in.  But I'm oddly comfortable and non-homoerotic or homophobic with like touching my friends.  Like I feel no weird sexual energy or weird...  I guess because the comics I know, we all... 
[03:31:30]  Like I always hug Keith.  Like when we come off the cellar, when he's coming back up and I'm walking off, I'll hug  him in front of the audience until he breaks free.  I got used to kissing recently, so...  I think guys...  Yeah, Brother Weez kisses me.  Where?  On the cheek.  I don't really kiss guys.  No, me neither.  My dad kissed me and...  Dads are different.  Old school dads.  Weez is an old guy though, so that's old school guys.  I think that's it though.  But I was comfortable with it.  I'm trying to think of any other guy.  Because there's a fatherly thing about it when it's somebody who's a lot older and 
[03:32:00]  it's a guy you see as a father figure.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if Bladder kissed you.  That would be awkward.  Yeah, but especially if he made that like weird, like Jughead Bladder face.  I'm going to put the video up.  We're going to go down and see Kenny.  Troy, could you give Jim a real quick kiss before he goes?  Like on the cheek?  Just a kiss on the cheek.  Jim, do you want me to kiss you on the cheek?  No.  Or Opie then.  Opie's a kisser now.  I'm just saying I'm a kisser now. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, you're like a kisser.  Yeah, I'm not seeing anything specific.  No, no, no.  It just makes me sad.  Like a good show buddy.  Thank you.  And you kiss him on the cheek.  Can I just give him a pounder?  Just not.  See?  No, no, no.  Just kiss your fist or something first.  Me and my kid do that.  We do pounders.  Pounders.  That's a cool kid.  He is a cool kid.  Are you sure you guys don't want to kiss?  Troy, what's your hoarding thing?  Let me go over to the other station. 
[03:33:00]  But what's your...  Everybody around here, I'm not the only one.  Enough of this bullshit with me being the one with the problem.  I mean, Eric's the worst hoarder than me with his shit.  What's your hoarding shit?  I used to be a hoarder with, I don't know, stupid shit, music, like CDs, music.  He used to collect a lot of music.  But my ex-girlfriend, Abby, had a problem with saving everything.  And it became so disgusting that I just, I completely hate it now.  And I have...  She had the problem.  She had a problem and I was so disgusted by it that I had become a minimalist where I just throw everything out and want to have nothing in my apartment. 
[03:33:30]  Do you have a TV?  I do.  I don't have cable hooked up.  I mean, I occasionally watch a DVD.  How big is your TV?  You know, I don't know.  You know.  Bigger than 32 inches probably.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  You have a bigger TV than either of mine and you don't even have cable hooked up to it.  Right.  Yeah, I have the box to do it, but I just don't have it hooked up.  Don't you have to return the box?  No, well, sort of, because last year I turned it on over the winter and I just kept the box and they put up a fight and they say, you know, threaten me with a bunch of shit. 
[03:34:00]  I'm like, fuck you, dude.  I'm going to turn it back on.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  When are you going to turn it back on?  I'm probably not going to.  You're just going to keep the box for yourself?  Yeah.  Just out of spite.  Hey, you have to return that.  Fuck you.  Yeah, well, eventually I might turn it back on.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You'd like to have the option.  You don't have to wait for that guy.  Right.  And then you have to wait for them to come out and install the box and it's a whole ordeal.  Now I can just give them the number and they can just turn it right back on.  But are you going to be able to call them and say, hey, I never returned that box.  Just turn it back on.  They know I have, but I still get internet from them. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, okay.  So you're still right there.  Right.  What about you, Sal?  Sal the intern.  Everybody's favorite little buddy, Sal the intern.  I don't know why Sam doesn't like me anymore.  Mr. Perfect.  Mr. Never does anything wrong.  Yes.  What are your disorders?  My disorders?  Yeah.  I do have like some OCDs, I suppose.  Like if I do something to like the left side of my body, I like to do it to the right  side of my body.  You were molested.  Yeah, I was.  Yeah, I was.  That's obvious. 
[03:35:00]  No, like if I like, if I like, like, you know, knock my finger or something, I like to do it  to the other one.  I can't.  I don't know why.  It's a weird thing.  And I bite my nails.  But I feel like with my hoarding wrestling stuff being any sort of hindrance on my life,  like Eric's desire for celebrity memorabilia and autographs is way, way worse than my wrestling  stuff.  Oh, absolutely.  Like to the point where he's gotten scolded multiple times at his job for it.  And he doesn't, it doesn't stop him.  Like Eric, do you think you have a problem hoarding like celebrity autographs and pictures 
[03:35:30]  and stuff?  There's a difference between hoarding and collecting.  I know.  That's why I said hoarding.  I'm not hoarding.  But like you get autographs and pictures of people who you don't even know what they do  or who they are.  I haven't done that in a long time.  You keep saying that and that's not true.  You've done, I've seen you done it.  You do it.  No.  If somebody's famous, you'll get a picture with them or like you'll get multiple autographs  from people.  Like a lot.  And people that don't even ask for them.  What do you mean people don't ask?  Well, he'll get autographs for like Opie's kid.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[03:36:00]  You know what I mean?  And like, and people that just don't even have any.  It's not this again.  It's like, I, I think personally that you definitely just have this need to get people  to sign something when they come in here.  You know, I mean, you're not being scolded.  I was just for two days talking about my hoarding, Eric.  Nobody's ganging up on you.  No, I'm not saying you are.  We're talking to you like people.  No.  You don't think that like you have a thing where you just have to get things signed  by people when they come in here?  Well, if it's here and they're here, why not? 
[03:36:30]  Because it's not here half the time.  You're bringing it from home.  And it's multiple things.  It's not just one thing.  Like you, like you always get a lot of stuff signed by, by most of the guests that come  in here.  Who was here Friday?  David Duchovny.  David Duchovny.  He had seven things signed by David Duchovny.  I had one thing.  Why was there seven things on display out there?  There were, I don't know who the other shit was.  There's two things that were for a giveaway, which we didn't do.  And I have mine.  Okay, so you had three things.  Because the giveaway too.  The two were the booklets that were here in the studio. 
[03:37:00]  But people don't like to sign a bunch of stuff when they leave.  Like, whether it's here or not, like, the fact that you can't just say, oh, that's here.  You don't think that might be a thing?  Maybe, maybe not.  Who knows?  You're right, Troy.  But the fact that he won't even have a conversation with it.  No.  He doesn't, but he just doesn't, I don't know, he doesn't admit to the way he behaves.  Jim and Opie.  We have a problem.  Yeah.  Now, you're talking about E-Rock getting things signed.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  And getting things for Opie's son.  Yeah, I mean.  Opie's son is one.  We all know that E-Rock is only doing that.  It's a nice gesture if it's Barney or one of the Wiggles.  But we all know that E-Rock is doing that as an excuse to get himself something.  It's not a genuine, it's almost like, well, no one can say anything if I'm getting it for Opie's son.  Right.  The same thing with the giveaways.  Like, when he said, hey, I got some stuff signed for the giveaway. 
[03:38:00]  It's like, yeah, that's a cool thing to do.  I guess I appreciate it, but it's like, nobody asked.  When's the last time we gave something away that was signed?  When?  Yeah, I don't know.  Sam does.  Well, he does.  Because they don't do it, so I stopped giving stuff into the show.  What did Seth sign today?  Seth signed some DVDs and a poster for Roland.  Some DVDs.  How many?  I had two.  For who?  For me.  But why do you need two? 
[03:38:30]  Because, should I answer that honestly?  Yeah.  Because he wants to give them away on his Twitter.  Nope.  All right, so Eric, like, for your purse, that's what I'm saying.  Those are mine, yeah.  Like, did you get something signed last time he was in?  Yes.  Yeah.  So now you have, like, at least three to four things in your own house signed by Seth Rogen.  Why on earth?  Why every time?  Like, I can see if you love the guy, like if he's your favorite guy, but why, everyone  that comes in, like, every time they come in, like, even I don't do that. 
[03:39:00]  Like, I got sent to sign my one DVD today, but not multiple copies, and last time I didn't  get him to sign anything.  Okay.  Eric.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, what do you think?  I don't think there's a problem here.  And he's not going to stop.  It's not going to change.  It's unprofessional.  And I'm saying that.  Then it won't happen again.  What's that?  Then it won't happen again.  If you have a problem with it, it won't happen again.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying have balance.  Have a balance.  I didn't say don't ever do it.  I get stuff.  Just be balanced with it.  Is there a reason, Eric, why you think, like, you need, like, multiple things signed by 
[03:39:30]  people?  If you think it's just cool.  No, just to have.  If you just think it's cool, just say it's just cool.  It is cool just to have.  But it doesn't matter what I say, because when it turns on to me, no matter what answer  I give, it's not going to be the answer that everyone else has.  No, Jim, I'm not saying you.  I'm just saying just in general.  Because Mark Wahlberg, right, is coming into the split.  We didn't do him today because he's coming in too late.  He's not even yet.  But I didn't leave anything for him to get signed. 
[03:40:00]  Like, I got my photo signed the first time I saw him, and he did one of my favorite movies,  so he signed Boogie Nights, and that's it.  Like, I got what I wanted.  And believe me, I understand the joy of doing that, but we don't need to get multiple things  every time these guys come in, because it really does, after a while, start to look  ridiculous.  Eric?  Yeah, fuck.  I'm letting him...  What's that?  I'm sorry.  No, no, I was listening to you.  And we don't need to get photos, multiple photos, every time they come in. 
[03:40:30]  Like, if we already got one, I didn't get one with Mark Wahlberg last time he was in,  because I had one from another event.  So if we get one, but then every time they come in at the barrage, they're going to start  to think, like, what the fuck?  Am I crazy?  No.  I mean, and that's what...  You don't think there's some sort of Eric Hoarding mentality in that, that you get multiple  pictures with people, and you have to get so much stuff signed by everybody?  Like, you don't...  Do you not see that you get more stuff signed and more pictures taken than anybody else? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, probably.  So do you see...  You don't think that that's, like, a thing?  Yeah.  I don't get shit signed for people, ever, unless it's something, like, that is really  going to mean something to one person I know.  Like, but I can't remember the last time I got something signed for another person.  You know, because it's just, we all have too many people we want to get stuff signed for.  Right.  It's like, we have to limit it, because otherwise we just seem like assholes. 
[03:41:30]  I mean, it's, we were trying to talk to you about your nephew before, and you thought  we were bashing you for caring about your family, but we appreciate that you care about  your family, but there's no way that your eight-year-old nephew wants 25 autographs.  He's eight.  Uh, Sam?  Yeah?  By the way, I need a new, uh, Larry the Cable Guy autograph.  Why is that?  Well, D-Rock, uh, when did you get signed, D-Rock? 
[03:42:00]  I don't know.  You probably gave it to your nephew or something.  Uh, it was a Cars DVD.  Cars Blu-ray.  Yeah, no, for my, for my, uh, son, you got, like, a little car from the movie Cars signed  by Larry the Cable Guy.  Yeah.  And I had a Christmas party this, uh, weekend for my extended family, and one of my nephews  saw a nice toy that he could open up.  How, okay.  And how old is your nephew?  How old is your nephew? 
[03:42:30]  Uh, he's six, I believe.  Okay, so that's, uh, kids that are that age, one-year-old, a six-year-old, an eight-year-old,  when they see a toy that's in a package, they don't want it autographed, they want to open  it.  But I want to talk to the collectors among us here.  Would that bother you that something was signed and it's still in its packaging, and then  another kid came along and opened it up because he wanted to play with the toy?  By Larry the Cable Guy, no.  It was signed by Pryor.  I would have fucking ripped his leg on there.  But here's where I don't care. 
[03:43:00]  Like, everyone panicked, like, um, the kid's parents panicked, and I'm like, I don't care  whatever, it's fine.  Let them play with the stupid toy.  Yeah.  Well, you can't give an autograph to a one-year-old.  Yeah, the kid's stuff is only an excuse to get it for ourselves.  So stop with the kid's stuff, because it's not about the kids.  Can I tell you something nice about Iraq?  It pains me, because I don't say this often, but my kid's first movie was The Muppets, and  Iraq got a Muppets poster signed by Jason Segel, and it's now framed nice. 
[03:43:30]  That's something I'll, now, you're talking about how I don't save shit.  That's something I'll fucking save.  The first movie you ever saw, and now it's a poster signed by the guy.  See, that means something.  And, uh, Muppets are for children.  They're baby things.  And that, that makes sense.  Yeah, but that same day, he had a Muppets poster under it that he got signed for himself,  and then he got a DVD also signed for himself.  I don't give a fuck.  He took care of me.  That's all I'm talking about right now. 
[03:44:00]  And guess what?  A gift that I'm keeping, unlike that stupid Islanders poster.  But do you see where it becomes compulsive to get, like, two items?  You don't love Jason Segel.  You don't love the Muppets movie.  I love Jason Segel.  I like him.  But he's not a guy you've idolized.  Like, I could see if it was Hulk Hogan, who you love, love, love.  But Jason Segel's just an actor who you kind of like.  Eric, he's asking you if you see where it becomes compulsive. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock, you're hoarding, what are you hoarding blonde hats?  Pay us something?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I like that.  Jack, can I give you a beard update?  Yes.  My beard officially, I could put rubber bands in it now.  Really?  And I know you appreciate a good Lou Albano reference.  Absolutely.  I've said this on the after show.  I'm telling you, you're going to let the beard grow out until it becomes, like, part of your identity.  You're not going to be able to shave it.  Yep.  No, no, it's not part of my identity. 
[03:45:00]  It's really starting to bother people, and that's why I will not shave it.  I just saw that Jenny broad, that Jew broad.  Jenny Hutt.  The billionaire.  And she was, like, freaked out because of her beard.  She was freaked out by it.  What, it's a, it's a disarming thing, the beard.  She hated it.  And I told that broad, I said, you are rich.  Because if you go to justchenning.com, look what she did for her son's, uh, is it bat mitzvah or bar?  Bar mitzvah's the boy, bat mitzvah's for the young lady. 
[03:45:30]  Is that how that works?  Yeah.  They went, they went to, like, uh, that Jewish country.  Hurry up!  Yo, broad!  We're just hunking a really, really old lady in the street.  Whoa!  Ron Bennington is in the house.  Can you hear the phones?  Who is Jenny Hutt to talk about beards?  That's, Opie, Ron's on your side on this one. 
[03:46:00]  You know what?  I would, I would take a quick look at, uh, Jenny today.  Thank God Ron is there.  Look close.  She's got a lot of fucking fuzzies on her face.  Let me tell you, and it ain't just her face.  I mean, she's very, very well known for a 70s muff.  Really?  She doesn't shave at all?  No, because she's a Hasidic Jew.  I had no idea.  So, yeah.  I knew Jewish.  I didn't know Hasidic.  Belly button to the kneecaps.  Oh, incredible.  Yeah.  How did you get, is this something she talks about on her show?  I believe so, yeah.  I think Martha talked about it once. 
[03:46:30]  And it was kind of just one of those whatever things, right?  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  Oh.  Well, we don't want to interrupt this chemistry, so I'm going to go.  Yes.  We're at our buildings.  Ronnie B, it was great doing radio with you.  It was fantastic.  You know what?  Let's throw this right up on YouTube right now.  Let people hear the magic.  Let's do it.  Crossover magic.  Sounds good.  All right, guys.  All right, Jim and Opie.  Goodbye.  Bye, guys.  Goodbye.  And Club Soda Kenny.  Goodbye to you, too.  Where do they all go?  Facebook.com.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, it's got that. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, jeez.  I hung up on him.  Opie Radio fans on Facebook.  I hear people talking about this Facebook.  What exactly is it?  It's a social experiment, I think.  Like a social networking thing.  I saw a thing the other night on TV.  They said over 8,000 people belong to Facebook now.  So it's just blowing up.  It's 8,000?  Is today the day for Roland's Pizza Party?  We don't know.  This could be it.  How did you do over the weekend with your fitness?  Let's just say Greg Charles gave me a call. 
[03:47:30]  I went to Caroline's.  I woke up at like 5 a.m.  Right.  At the big eight.  She's on the roll.  It seems like Roland getting into shape is something that he can do kind of during the  week a little bit, but once the weekend hits.  Well, should I not throw the pizza party for him that he requested?  I'm going to leave this up to you, Roland.  Roland, would you rather we can get salads?  No.  Pizza's fine.  Pizza's fine.  Pizza fits into the new program?  Yeah, because it has my dairy intake and all that stuff. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, okay.  So there's dairy in it.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  The meats.  It does hit a lot of the different food groups.  Yeah.  You know what?  Maybe we should all start growing beards.  Maybe that's the way to do it.  In support of Opie.  Yeah.  Like we support your beard.  We don't think it's ugly or frightening.  By the way, Sam, I'm so fucking excited to hear that you turned your back on wrestling.  I do think it's new grown-ups, Sam.  I didn't turn my back on wrestling.  I'm not going to.  I don't think there's any reason to.  It doesn't hinder my life.  If this was an issue that specifically hindered my life. 
[03:48:30]  Do you realize that every year you look more and more like Mickey Mouse?  Why is that?  Does that come up?  No.  Why is that?  I don't know, but it's going around.  People are talking.  Who?  You know, this person, that person.  I don't listen.  I don't like that.  You know how they are in the halls.  Just yip, yip, yip.  You saw whatever Jenny did.  With Dopey's beard.  Yeah.  That hurt his feelings, too.  He doesn't want to say it.  It should.  It should hurt, because, you know what?  As a matter of fact, I'm going to consider that harassment.  Work harassment.  That becomes an HR issue very quickly. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know.  I think it's more of a PR issue.  We'll get bars in here.  We'll call a couple of Puerto Ricans down here and fucking fix this shit.  Yeah.  After their naps.  Oh.  Whoa.  No, seriously, I love race humor.  That's your thing?  It's the best kind of humor.  What about your intern here, UCB Fred?  What about him?  He's trying to gain weight at the same time Roland's trying to lose weight.  Fred, how are we with that?  Not doing very well.  I'm struggling trying to put this chair down, because I don't have enough weight. 
[03:49:30]  He would actually do this.  This is the thing about Fred.  And I'm not even making this up.  He said, I go, where are you going?  He goes, I'm going up to get my lunch.  And he'll come down with a little baggie, and I'll have a half an apple with some nuts in it.  I'm not even making that up.  That's the problem.  Like six nuts and a half an apple.  Which is a very delicious meal.  You can't eat a whole apple.  Your burger can eat $1.99.  He has these burgers for $1.99.  He can't finish anything.  He cannot keep food down, because he saw something awful when he was a child. 
[03:50:00]  Is that what it is?  A molestation thing again?  I don't want to talk about that.  You know, one of our, my mother, when I was in middle school.  Molested you.  No.  That's not what I was going to say.  That would have been a great story, though.  Yeah, it would have been nice to break it here.  But she wanted me to gain weight, much like UCB Fred.  She switched my milk from 2% to whole.  Made a world of difference.  Maybe that's something you want to try, Fred.  I don't know if you tried her.  It's really thick.  It's a little too thick.  It's too thick.  It's viscous. 
[03:50:30]  It's weird.  Yeah.  Well, she already had you in 2% of tininess.  That's what she was going for.  Now, did we ever work out anything with the disrespect to Tom Papa the other day?  Did we ever get to the bottom of it?  Roland sent off some emails.  He fired him off.  I think Tom Papa was able to somehow let it roll off his back.  Yeah.  Which does go to show not only what I've got away with it.  Who?  McDermott got away with it.  Oh, I guess that's the name we were mentioning. 
[03:51:00]  He said he was going to...  Why wouldn't you say it the other day?  You felt like you didn't want to...  Yeah, 24 hours.  Yeah, 24 hours.  Everything's okay.  You let it smooth over, and then you start fanning the flames again.  That's right.  You were nervous the other day when I was in here.  You were upset that somehow your balls would get caught in the...  Well, he thought that when I told professional comedian Tom Papa that Roland was obviously  cock-blocking him from O&A, that Tom Papa would not see this as a joke, but see it as  literally, that son of a bitch Roland must be cock-blocking me from O&A. 
[03:51:30]  Where's McDermott?  It's good to know.  So you guys had some big stars stopping by here today, Seth.  Oh, my God.  All together at the same time, too.  Jim Brewer, Seth Rogen, and what's her name?  Dr. Z, Robin Z from Hoarders.  Do you watch Hoarders?  One of the Hoarders lives near me.  Is that true?  Yeah, the New York Hoarder.  If anybody ever watched the show, it's the guy who fills up vans and junk cars in front  of his place and then has to move it from side to side. 
[03:52:00]  He's quite the talk of my neighborhood.  I would imagine he's a TV star in your hood.  Well, even long before he got on Hoarders, everybody's like, what the fuck is...  I don't know what to do with this guy because he just fills shit up.  Like, he has these old cars because his apartment isn't big enough.  And then he moves it from one side of the street to the other.  How many cars does he have?  Sometimes I've seen as many as three.  And then I guess the cops will confiscate some or whatever.  But the reason why he does it is, we saw from the TV show, his apartment's just fucking 
[03:52:30]  packed.  Is he in like a one-bedroom small thing?  No, I think he's got a two-bedroom.  It's one of those things where he grew up in New York, blah, blah, blah.  This apartment is probably, you know, he has it for $1.50.  Right.  But on the show, his parents invented the talk show.  There was nobody on radio.  The format.  Yeah, the format of the talk show.  So they start to think that they were a man and a woman.  And they started to have like, hey, like this thing that we're doing right now at the breakfast  table should be a show. 
[03:53:00]  And then they tried it and they're like, hey, we should bring entertainers in.  And this was like back in the early days of radio.  Yeah.  How did everybody just like, they invented radio and everybody thought we either got  to play music or do bits.  There's no way we can just sit here and talk.  Yeah.  They, they, they, what they tried to do immediately was let's bring concerts into this or let's  bring plays into it.  No one thought people could just talk on the radio.  All we need to do is buy a mic.  What are we doing with all this production value?  Well, look out, you know, look how long the fucking internet was around before someone 
[03:53:30]  came up with podcasting.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Why don't we just record this shit and put it up?  Everyone's just like in the last year.  Everyone's just like, Hey, I have a podcast.  Where have you been?  All this other times, I don't know, vlogging.  But so this guy, he doesn't live in your building.  No.  But he lives near you.  He lives in my neighborhood.  Are you more on the side of minimalism or hoarding?  Do you have anything?  I don't give a fuck about anything.  Do you throw shit out all the time?  All the time.  I have, there's nothing that holds a special place in my heart.  No family stuff, nothing. 
[03:54:00]  Not even family themselves.  No family, no old friends.  I don't care if people call me at Christmas or my, I just don't, I don't look backwards.  It's by the minute for you.  It is.  I think the Doobie brothers put it best when they said minute by minute.  That's, and, and, and I guess that gives you a peace of mind where, what do you got to  worry about?  Well, I don't think I, it's not like a philosophy I've, I've, I've went after.  I just fucking feel that way.  Like, what's the big deal?  Oh, want to look at pictures of high school?  Why?  Well, yeah. 
[03:54:30]  So that's why, I guess that's why you don't have Facebook either.  Even virtually.  I don't have Facebook.  I don't have Twitter.  I don't, actually, I don't even think I have a computer.  You don't.  I do have an old adding machine.  I'm pretty sure you have a computer because I emailed you to let you know that the Stangles  had written a shout out for you on the Letterman show.  This was over Christmas break.  And the response I got back from Ron was, how did you find this email address?  Never write me at home again.  Here's the thing.  That's my PR firm that runs that for me.  Oh, I see.  Their job is to keep me out. 
[03:55:00]  And they wanted to nip this thing in the butt before, you know.  They tried to do a cease and desist to Letterman to keep my name off there.  He's not going to be answering any phone calls for anybody.  It was a fun time.  Well, listen, we have to let you do your show, too.  Do my thing.  I've got to do my thing.  Do you have anything lined up for today?  We had Seth Rogen, Jim Brewer, and Dr. Z.  Luckily, you have this nonsense to buffer it.  So it's like you're not following the big celebrity thing. 
[03:55:30]  You're following nothing.  We do have some plan today.  Me and Hicks are going to drink Jimson weed.  We're making it into a tea and seeing how long it takes us to trip off of it.  And how's Fezzy doing today?  Like you said, last week it was scary weird.  It was really great.  Check out his site, FezRadio.com.  He wants to interact with you guys.  Okay.  FezRadio.com.  I think that's it.  I don't know.  We'll find out what it is in just a few minutes when Ron and Fez begins.  Nice segue.  Nice segue.  I know you always like it when I segue. 
[03:56:00]  No, Eric.  There is no read.  That's the end of the show.  So tune in tomorrow.  Roland, guest tomorrow?  Brewer might be coming back, might not.  Yeah, I think another day.  Then Florentine's coming in tomorrow.  Rogan?  One more Rogan?  Should we get Seth Rogen back in?  All right.  We'll get Seth Rogen back in tomorrow and see what Dr. Z is doing.  The Wednesdays, the three guys.  What three guys?  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer this Wednesday.  Well, Michael Clark, Duncan, and those.  With Emerson, Lake, and Palmer? 
[03:56:30]  The directors of Paradise Lost 3.  Oh, okay.  The West Memphis 3 directors.  There you go.  Very exciting.  All coming up this week on Opie and Anthony.  I think they did it.  The directors?  No, I think those kids killed them.  I really do.  I went over the whole case.  And I do think that they killed those little babies.  These guys got away with murder.  They did.  That was a twist at the end.  Yeah.  That was the fun part.  That's what we learned from the West Memphis 3.  Stick to your story, and you'll finally get away with it.  Stick to it.  Ron and Fez are coming up next. 
[03:57:00]  Goodbye, everybody. </pre>
