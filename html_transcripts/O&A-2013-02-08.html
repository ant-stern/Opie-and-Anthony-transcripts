<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, engaging in their typical vulgar and sexually explicit banter, outlining the day's planned segments.  Jim Norton was mentioned as a co-host.  A significant portion was dedicated to a weather forecast debate, with Anthony predicting rain and Opie forecasting heavy snow, punctuated by mockery of conflicting weather reports and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino’s press conference regarding an impending snowstorm. This was followed by a reading of a Reddit thread listing offensively named bands banned from a college radio station, with the hosts adding their own commentary. They then mocked a viral video of a toddler attempting basketball shots and a news story about a cop on the loose who mentioned several comedians in a manifesto.  Clips from Mike Francesa's radio show were played, highlighting his easily triggered nature and tendency to stutter, with jokes made about his reaction to prank calls.  The segment also mentioned several guests, including the author of "Bailout," and concluded with discussion of the show’s chaotic nature and scheduling issues caused by an excessive number of commercial breaks.

The next segment featured two guests: Neil Barofsky, author of "Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street," who discussed the failures of the Wall Street bailout, the lack of accountability for banks, and the perceived similarities between Democrats and Republicans on the issue; and Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of David Miscavige, who detailed her upbringing in Scientology, her departure in 2005, and the organization's controlling and potentially abusive aspects, including the secrecy surrounding the Xenu story and the e-meter.  The hosts joked throughout both interviews.  Commercial breaks included advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers and Sherry's Berries.  A later segment focused on Jenna Miscavige Hill again, expanding on her experiences growing up in Scientology, her speculation on the whereabouts of her aunt, and Scientology's changing dynamics in the digital age.

This transitioned into a bizarre and sexually explicit segment involving an on-air Brazilian wax given to Sal, one of the hosts, by Lana, a female waxer. The segment was filled with graphic descriptions and vulgar jokes, detailing the pain Sal experienced and Lana's experiences emigrating from Russia.  This waxing segment, filled with vulgar jokes and graphic descriptions of the process (including Sal's pubic area, testicles, and nipples), continued with further commentary from the hosts and guests, including Anthony and Lana.  A stray piece of wax landed on a microphone and then a staffer, Travis.  The segment concluded with discussions about Sal's performance and included listener calls, some praising Sal's endurance, others offering disparaging remarks, along with discussions about the intern's recent misconduct.  Numerous commercial breaks punctuated this graphic segment.

The final segment focused on a discussion about the attractiveness of various people in the studio, including an intern named Alan and Nicole.  The hosts debated who would sleep with whom, with a focus on Troy’s girlfriend and the intern. A lengthy commercial read for Steven Singer Jewelers, focusing on a gold-dipped rose, interspersed with playful banter about Nicole's reactions and Troy's jealousy, highlighted the segment.  The discussion concluded with speculation about Sam's feelings and Nicole stating she would sleep with Sam before the show ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Never before has one radio show been so extreme...  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar...  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So...  Flash you went. 
[00:00:30]  I've been five-parted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  This is good practice when I do The View.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and convention burns the ground. 
[00:01:00]  Don't do it, I can't take it.  Every time I'm on the show, I see his cock.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger deuce bag.  You're a big deuce bag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  That's why I can't even take fingers in my ass because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, ah, noises.  That's the sound of the storm.  Ah, I don't think so.  Not for New York City.  I'm gonna make my storm prediction. 
[00:02:00]  You failed on the last one.  I know, I'm due.  You failed on the last big one.  I'm due.  I got the sports curse, you got the weather curse.  No, this one, I'm sure of this one.  We are getting rain.  New York and Long Island, it will be a rain event.  Nah.  We will get a mix.  You'll see some snow, but this will not be an accumulating snow event.  This will be a rain event, people. 
[00:02:30]  Mostly rain.  Calm the fuck down.  Don't sweat it.  They're already doing the slightest bit of backpedaling on the news already to cover  their asses.  They're starting.  They went from 12 to 18 inches on Long Island.  Now it's back to this fucking 8 to 10 or something like that for New York City and Long Island 
[00:03:00]  and then extreme east and Long Island and the same something else.  And then they showed a wintry mix for north of the Long Island Sound and pretty much heavy  rain up until like Friday night for Long Island in the city.  I'm not buying this.  They're already fucking trying to protect themselves.  You're gonna be 0 for 2.  You watch this one.  I say 6 inches at least.  At least for New York City.  Let's see who's right.  Boston will probably get slammed.  Of course. 
[00:03:30]  And then Long Island will be over a foot.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  I don't see this big wraparound of cold air that they're talking.  This fucking thing is coming up the coast.  It's gonna merge with the other one.  Nah, nah, nah.  The one up from down below us is coming first and then it's gonna merge with the other thing  and then the other thing's gonna swing around and really smack us.  Too late for the cold air.  We're not getting that big cold air.  But you're right.  Boston's gonna get hammered. 
[00:04:00]  Hammered.  Yeah, Boffiston is...  It's gonna be wicked snowy.  Right in the sights.  Hammered.  They're talking it could set an all-time record.  The all-time record for Boston is 27 inches of snowfall.  Oh, is Ira here today?  He is here on Fridays.  He's good at predicting the weather.  He is good with the weather.  I would like to hear his take on it.  Yeah, if you get Ira in studio today, just for a couple minutes, that's it.  Just for a weather forecast.  We need a weather forecast from the mayor.  Yeah, so I'm not seeing much going on there. 
[00:04:30]  Boffiston, though, of course, the mayor, I guess, said everyone should not go out on Sadie.  Well, we got that, yeah.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, we got it.  Don't worry.  Sadie!  Mayor Menino, one of our favorites.  Oh, he's a treat.  We've been a thorn in his side for many years.  Although a lot of radio guys do this bit.  Yeah.  I think Howie Ka.  Howie Ka.  I think he does this bit.  Does he?  He likes to make fun of Mayor Menino. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, people finally caught on after so many years that this guy has a speaking problem.  ESPN started doing the bit recently.  Yeah, yeah.  So Mayor Menino, who is a horrendous speaker, had to do a little press conference to prepare  Boffiston.  Boffiston.  For the big storm.  They're definitely going to get walloped.  Yeah.  So we picked out a couple clips here of the mayor warning Boston.  So here we go.  As you're all aware of, we have a significant snowstorm heading our way. 
[00:05:30]  First snowstorm this size in many years.  Today my team had to discuss how best to prepare to respond to this winter weather event.  We're having no school tomorrow.  That's the most important announcement.  I've got more calls on that than else.  No school.  You can't even understand what the fuck he's saying.  He said something that I didn't even know what it was.  He's truly a boob. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, he cannot speak.  It's amazing.  What did he say in there?  It started off okay.  Do you want to play that one again?  Yeah, yeah.  Because there was something in there.  As you're all aware of, we have a significant snowstorm.  Headed on our way.  First snowstorm this size in many years.  Today my team met to discuss how best to...  Oh.  Today my team met discuss.  Met to discuss.  I don't think he got that to do it.  My team met discuss. 
[00:06:30]  But he made a mistake when he said, as you're all aware of.  In the beginning.  You don't say as you're all aware of.  No, no.  As you're all aware.  Right.  In many years.  Today my team met to discuss how best to...  Best prepare to respond to this winter weather event.  We'll have no school tomorrow.  That's the most important of him now.  We'll have no school tomorrow.  We'll have no school tomorrow.  No school.  We'll have no school tomorrow.  We'll have no school. 
[00:07:00]  You know what?  When he's giving these kind of speeches, though, he doesn't go, where we see Bofferson in another  couple of years.  And of course, the leadership that we have put in place, we'll always have Bofferson in.  But if you're the mayor, you can't say, we have a noah school.  We have a noah school.  We have a noah school.  Mama mia.  Ah, right.  The forecast and National Weather Service advise us the public to stay put after noontime. 
[00:07:30]  Advise us the public.  What?  Advise us the public.  What?  Did he say it advises the public, or he said advise us the public?  I don't know.  Like, what the fuck is he saying?  It just amazes me that a city like Boston allows this.  Oh, it's so funny.  Shouldn't everyone get together and just go, will you let someone else talk?  They need to take a fucking plane down to his tongue, shave off some extra fucking curls. 
[00:08:00]  But the city should be outraged.  Yeah.  He's just an idiot.  This guy is representing you, and he has to get on TV in some tough spots and talk to the city,  and this is how he talks to them?  This is how he does it.  The forecast and National Weather Service advise us the public to stay put after noontime tomorrow.  If you're at a location tomorrow, after noontime, stay there.  Don't move, because the snow will be...  What if you're in a 7-Eleven? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck?  What if you're...  What if you're in your car?  Yeah.  You're walking somewhere.  He's going to call a freeze.  That's it.  Everyone freeze.  And freeze.  Right.  What do you mean, don't move?  What are you talking about?  Don't move.  Wouldn't you say try to get home before noon?  Get home.  If you're at a location tomorrow, by noontime, stay there.  Don't move, because the snow will be coming down two to three inches.  And we want all of our...  Yeah, that's two to three inches an hour. 
[00:09:00]  An hour.  That's a big difference.  That's two to three inches.  Yeah, people listening will just assume, oh, all this talk for two to three inches?  That's not much.  How much longer before Boston do we get storms?  Like 12 hours or 18 hours?  No, it's all hitting kind of the same.  I guess it depends on how fast it moves, but...  So we're not getting it today?  Well, we're getting some shit sometime this morning.  Thanks, man.  We're getting some rain.  I heard...  According to Anthony, uh...  Nothing.  A drizzle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing until...  A drizzle. 
[00:09:30]  A warm drizzle.  Nothing until afternoon, and then it's going to be rain.  It's all kind of converging.  They can't really figure this one out, although they've got to kind of figure it out for Boston  now.  They will not.  New York is still kind of shady what will happen.  I say a rain event.  The snow will be coming down two to three inches.  And we want all of our children and school staff to stay home tomorrow.  Did he pluralize children with an S?  Yes. 
[00:10:00]  All of our children's.  Yeah.  All the chidgens.  And we want all of our children and school staff to stay home tomorrow.  Our children's in school staff.  Mayor Leslie Uggams.  We want all our children's in school staff.  Okay.  All right.  All our chillings.  We have increased the staff and the patrols of our public safety and frontline departments. 
[00:10:30]  The snow emergency in the city of Boston will go into effect at noontime tomorrow.  The Boston police and the traffic department will be out on the streets of our city,  notify the public.  Bull horns and other mechanisms to tell people about the snow emergency in the city of Boston  as we go forward.  Bull horns and other mechanisms.  Mechanisms.  Bull horns and other mechanisms. 
[00:11:00]  Dummy.  When they put all this in the paper, do they fix it all up or do they just transcribe it like this?  I would just transcribe it like this.  They transcribe it.  You can always tell if you read along with the transcription of his speeches.  Right.  They just give the speech that they give to Menino.  Yeah.  So, like, they have the copy that Menino is supposed to be reading, so it's not really  a transcription.  Oh, that's not fair.  That isn't.  No one has the balls up there in the Boston Herald or the Globe or something just to say,  well, this is what he said. 
[00:11:30]  Children's and mechanisms.  Yeah.  Transcribe what he said.  Well, people would think it was typos.  That's why they find out.  Yeah.  True.  Woody in Iowa.  Woody.  Hey, at the very beginning, he tries to say the most significant snowstorm in history,  and it comes out like the most sniff-cut.  Really?  Yeah, he goes sniff-cut.  Yeah.  At the very beginning.  He said, uh, Smith-cut?  Hold on.  Sniff.  Like sniff.  Oh, sniff-cut.  All right, let's see if that's in there. 
[00:12:00]  All right, hold on a minute.  As you're all aware of, we have a significant snowstorm heading our way for a snowstorm this  size in many years.  Today, my team had to discuss how best to prepare to respond to this winter weather event.  I didn't really hear that.  You didn't see that.  I didn't hear sniff-cut.  I heard a lot of weird other words.  I got all excited that he might have said sniff-cut.  No, we'd have picked right up on that.  Does that radio station allow to play sniff-cut?  E-Rock, I saw you tweeting. 
[00:12:30]  No.  They're not allowed to play sniff-cut?  No.  That's too bad.  What radio station play sniff-cut?  Nah, it's a thing.  We'll probably get into a whole list of bands that this Christian station's not allowed to  play, right?  Oh.  Yeah, and then if you mention any artist, you're terminated right away.  Yeah, it was on Reddit.  Yeah.  Wow.  It was pretty much...  Really understanding group, Christians.  What a shitty bunch.  It was trending on Reddit.  Shitty bunch.  We'll get into that in a second.  It's pretty funny, actually. 
[00:13:00]  Mayor Menino warning the city of Boston about this big storm.  We are hardy New Englanders.  Let me tell you.  And you two.  He's tight.  We are hardy New Englanders.  Did he say hardy?  I think he was trying to say.  I'd say hardy.  That is, we are hardy New England-ness.  We're hardy New England-ness.  It's already snowing right now in the city, according to Mike in Brooklyn.  Shut the fuck up.  Mike's full of turkey.  We have windows.  You're a lying sack of shit. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  We'll look out our windows, Mike.  We don't need you.  Exactly.  You wet bag of cancer lumps.  Wow.  Okay.  All right, then.  We are hardy New England-ness.  Let me tell you.  I'm used to these types of storms.  But I also want to remind everyone to use common sense.  Stay off the streets of our city.  Basically, stay home.  And pay attention to public announcements.  We'll continue to update the public with information as we have it. 
[00:14:00]  And also that we ask folks if they live next door a senior or handicapped individual,  knock on their door, see if they need some help during the snowstorm.  But also, as you clear out your driveway, your sidewalk, don't throw the snow back onto the streets.  It's a fine for businesses.  We've had many businesses who plow their own parking lots and throw the snow back on us.  That's forbidden in the city of Boston.  You know, the Inspectoral Service Department will be out there checking on that as we go forward. 
[00:14:30]  It's just too much work to listen to.  It really is a chore.  If you really, really try real hard and listen extra hard, you kind of hear what he's saying.  Yeah, but it's exhausting.  It is a chore.  Finally.  It's a very serious storm.  We have many staff who are going to be out there.  Right behind me, you see several departments are going to be called on to deal with the emergency.  So starting tomorrow, there's a, also there's a essential workforce only at city departments tomorrow. 
[00:15:00]  You decide who you are, whether it's essential or not.  I'm essential, I think.  But also, no school tomorrow in the city of Boston.  So the message here is stay off the public roadways.  If you have to come in town, take public transportation.  I advise everyone to stay home tomorrow, stay off the streets tomorrow and Saturday.  We'll help our public works departments do a job they can do and clear the streets of our city. 
[00:15:30]  So when Monday comes, we'll open up the roadways of our city and people go back to work.  Oh, my God.  That wasn't fun today.  And he doesn't say anything.  That was like work.  Yeah.  Even if you understand him, there's no real substance to it.  No, nothing.  It's all basic knowledge.  Special works guys will be out there announcing what?  Yeah, check on your neighbors.  Stay off the fucking roads.  Don't throw your stupid snow in the street.  Basic shit.  They got a little baby basketball kid on Fox and Friends, and he was missing a lot. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's not alive.  He sure ain't a live fucking act.  Oh, no kidding.  He missed a lot?  Yes.  And I think he shit his pants.  Poor little guy.  Poor little guy.  He shit his pants.  He bombs on national television.  That's a tough spot to be in.  And then he shits himself.  But he's already peaked.  Yes.  More than just a YouTube video is going to be his book in 30 years. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, it's all that he'll be drugged out by the time he's four?  Yeah.  Poor kid's finished.  He stinks.  We got Jessica in the heart of Manhattan.  What?  57th Street, Jessica, right?  Yeah.  Jesse!  What do you got, Jessica?  I am on West 57th, between 11th and 12th, and it's snowing like crazy.  There you go.  You're a lion piece of garbage.  There you go.  You're already wrong.  It's not.  It's a flurry, if anything.  Hey, Sam, if you wanted to go look together, he's going to check out the window. 
[00:17:00]  Rain event.  It's not going to be a rain event.  Just to see, it's already snowing.  What's the temperature out there?  You got a temperature thing in your car?  33.  Exactly.  You got 33?  No, it's a little warmer.  It's 37.  Ah, see?  37.  Just stop it.  It's going to pour rain.  She's probably using the new clit thermometers.  They're like, you mount them on your clit, and you hang your legs out the window for 40 minutes,  and it gives you the temperature.  It's not a big cellar.  I would imagine it wouldn't be.  Is it snowing there, Sam?  Yeah, it's snowing. 
[00:17:30]  A lot?  Yeah, up here.  I don't believe, Sam.  If you go up close to the window, you can see it's starting to come down kind of hard.  But it ain't sticking.  It's a good five degrees colder up here than it is down on the street.  It's probably pouring down there on the street.  Pouring.  I bet you might be right on that.  I predict.  A lot of people say it's snowing, but not sticking in our area.  The New York City area.  Rain event.  Stinky!  There he is.  There he is.  He just wants to go to work.  I love Stinky's.  He's yelling his name like that. 
[00:18:00]  He just wants to get to his dumb studio and help out the J. Thomas guy.  This will be a rain event.  Stop.  I am guaranteeing it, people.  Don't fret.  Don't go crazy.  Relax.  Snowing.  Everything is going to be okay.  So what do you know about this meteorite?  What?  Asteroid, actually.  Oh, there's supposed to be some asteroid.  Yeah, but why does Fox News have the two-year-old on TV missing all sorts of shots? 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Well, on the front page of a lot of these news sites, it says, will it hit or miss Earth?  It's supposed to be...  I would rather know if an asteroid is going to hit Earth than see this kid try to make  baskets at two years old.  The video was cute and all, but fuck.  What's going on with the asteroid?  That's pretty much more important.  Yeah, I hear it's supposed to go pretty close.  It's inside the orbit of some of our satellites, I guess. 
[00:19:00]  Wow, really?  Is that what they're saying?  I don't know.  How big is this thing?  No impact scene.  It's probably very small.  Oh, so these news sites are kind of scaring the shit out of us a little bit.  As close to Earth.  Oh, boy.  Next week, the TV satellites that ring the planet.  There'll be no chance of it to hit.  Earth, the asteroid is about the size of an Olympic swimming pool.  Wow, really? 
[00:19:30]  150 feet in diameter.  That can do some damage.  It's projected to come as close as 17,000 miles from Earth.  Jesus.  17,000 miles.  That's like a near miss.  Look out.  In astronomy, that's like a near miss.  That's like getting nicked.  Oh, man.  I hope it hits us.  Jim Norton wants to give an accurate weather report.  Is it your prediction?  Yes, the meteor will hit us.  The storm will not.  Jim Norton.  Hi, this is Jim Norton.  I'm reporting live from inside the hallway.  Nice.  I'm standing at the window, and I see a little bit of snow falling. 
[00:20:00]  Uh-huh.  Sticking to the window a little bit, and it appears as if there's some snow falling.  Really?  That's it?  Yes, it does.  It's flipping around up here.  Little flakes.  Sticking to the window and whatnot.  And whatnot.  A little whatnot there?  Yeah.  Winter Wonderland.  They are hyping this one up.  Yeah.  Jim Norton signing out.  Okay.  That was meteorologist Jim Norton. 
[00:20:30]  From a mere 20 feet away.  Live on the scene.  Yes.  Look at that forecast totals.  Look, look.  7.1 now, they're predicting, for New York City.  Well, they're moving it up.  They were saying 12 inches earlier, and last night, they were saying 12 inches.  Now, they're saying 7 inches in New York City.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Wind gusts.  Yeah.  Very windy.  Yeah.  I predict a lot of power losses on Long Island. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  I, myself, will need a gas can.  My gas can's filled up.  When's your generator coming?  I don't know.  God damn it.  Very angry at that.  I need my generator.  But I have my little generator.  You know.  Okay.  I gotta fill that up.  Get some extension cords.  You know, batten down the old hatches, as they say.  Sure.  Yes.  And my heat went out last night.  Very harrowing experience.  I can imagine.  I can only imagine.  I lost heat for two and a half hours. 
[00:21:30]  My God.  It's crazy.  I was, like, primitive out there.  I don't even know if my heat works.  No.  You know, you just get building heat.  Still haven't turned it on.  Really?  Well, actually, we turned it on for a couple hours a few weeks ago, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The heat can be broken.  I have no idea.  No clue.  Wow.  I don't even know how to turn the heat on in my apartment.  Lucky.  I got, like, the, I don't know, you have to, it's, like, kind of an AC unit that has the  heat thing.  Yeah.  Just turn the knob.  It's the knob, but I don't even know.  The knob. 
[00:22:00]  No, I know you have to turn the knob, but I have no idea if you turn it to the left or  the right, because I just don't do it.  Oh.  Because we don't need heat.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, it's hailing in Selden.  Yeah.  Long Island.  That's what you're going to get.  You're going to get rain, sleet, that crap, and then it's just going to be that.  I still look forward to snow.  I love snow.  Like, I root for it.  Of course.  It's like that old George Carlin bit when there's fucking shit going down, you want it  to be the worst shit ever.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  I dream that New York City gets, like, five feet of snow.  Oh.  I would love it.  Well.  I want to be in a winter wonderland.  Huh.  That would be nice.  Frolicking in the snow.  That would be wonderful.  Where's Jim?  Oh, he's out there being playful.  Making snow angels with his penis out.  Snow angels.  How awful is that cop in L.A. still on the loose?  That's creepy.  He named comedians in his manifesto that he liked?  Patrice O'Neill and Louis C.K. 
[00:23:00]  Patrice, Louis, Kevin Hart, Lisa Lampanelli.  Wow.  He named them all, and he goes, you're geniuses, and I enjoy your work.  He listed comedians.  Oh, really?  And I just did Twitter.  Were you hoping?  I was jealous that he didn't mention me.  Were you hoping?  Yes.  Were you hoping?  I was like, how sick is it to be offended that a guy who's just murdered a couple and  shot three other cops didn't enjoy my accent?  Yes.  Wow.  That's crazy.  This guy is fucking terrible.  Last they know, he might be in Bear Mountain.  A couple hours, what? 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  North of L.A. there.  He'll kill himself.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hell, he's a terrible guy.  Yeah.  I guess he says that he didn't do what they said he did and kicked him off the force for.  Well, he did some stuff now.  That's what he's pissed about, but yeah.  Kind of did some things.  He certainly did.  They said he lied.  Like, he had brought charges about somebody.  He said somebody did something to a suspect or whatever it was, and they didn't find his  way.  And, uh...  Were his pants on fire? 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Oh, that proves it, Ben.  That proves it.  He likes Larry David, too.  Oh, he likes Larry David?  Yeah, he agrees with Larry David that you've got to keep your house at a nice temperature  around 72.  72?  I think it was 72.  He mentioned it in the manifesto.  Some people like to get it as high as 82, and he says that's crazy.  It's a good old manifesto.  And he agrees with Larry David on that one.  He shot the daughter.  He shot a cop's daughter.  That's who he killed.  It was a cop's daughter and her fiancé.  Jesus. 
[00:24:30]  And, uh...  And this was the guy who represented him in the hearing.  Oh.  So, uh...  He seems like one of these fucking complete wackos.  Yep.  Speaking of wack...  Oh, never mind.  They should just shoot him.  I'm sure they would love to.  Yeah.  Kill the cop's daughter.  I mean...  That's crazy.  What's that, uh...  Reddit list there, E-Rock?  Um, it's...  Comment?  They don't mention the station, but it's somebody who works at a Christian or a Catholic station.  It's Seton Hall University's station.  Wow.  So why did this get so much attention? 
[00:25:00]  I think it's just kind of funny.  Because they're just being silly?  I think it got attention because the names that you obviously can't say on the air, for  the FCC reasons, won't get you fired.  Right.  The names on the list that will get you fired are perfectly fine.  But wait.  There's funny names, though.  WSOU.  Wasn't that Seton Hall?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the station.  They had a great, like, metal show.  That's what it is.  It's a heavy metal radio station, but uttering any band names or playing any songs with the  words, Devil, Satan, God, Jesus, or any other Catholic reference that are portrayed in 
[00:25:30]  a negative light will result in suspension.  Oh, okay.  Now I'm all in.  I didn't know it was, uh...  You know, they had a metal show.  Because obviously it's tough to do a metal show without...  It's a whole radio station.  It's a whole metal station.  Right.  Wow.  If you can't play bands or songs that mention that stuff, it would be really tough to do  a metal show.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Nah, man.  I get it.  Can they play Venom?  Black Sabbath, Merciful, Fate?  Well, they can play some of that stuff as long as Satan's not in there or...  Black Sabbath.  Or Devil or...  So what's the list of the bands that are not allowed to touch there, E-Rod? 
[00:26:00]  Um, they're not allowed to touch Adolf Satan, Aborted Fetus, Abuses of the Clergy, Alabama  Thunder Pussy, Alien Sex Fiend, Anal Cunt, Angel Corpse, Angel Sin, Art Fag, Baby Jesus  Hitler.  Baby Jesus Hitler.  He's still in the B's, by the way.  Do you feel like these bands are trying a little too hard with their names?  Yes.  Baby Jesus Hitler. 
[00:26:30]  Come on, really?  I mean, come on.  Anal Cunt.  I am famous.  AC is pretty famous.  They are, I know.  They've been around forever.  Baby Jesus Hitler.  Did one of the guys die or something in AC?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ball Sack, go ahead.  Sorry.  Barbed Wire Condom, Bongzilla, Cannibal Corpse, Cradle of Fifth, Cruz...  Cradle of Fifth?  Cradle of Fifth.  Oh, Filth.  Sorry.  Why Cradle of Filth?  Maybe it references the manger.  Yeah, I didn't get the reference to Jesus. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, the Baby Jesus.  That's exactly right.  Baby Jesus Hitler.  Crucifux.  They're not allowed to play Crucifux?  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Cockspear.  Oh, man.  Cuntsaw.  Uh-huh.  Cybernetic God Crusher.  Dark Angel.  You know, when Cuntsaw started their career as a band, you think they were hoping for some  mainstream success?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I think so.  Ladies and gentlemen, Cuntsaw.  Here.  Coming in at number five. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  It's Cuntsaw.  Oh, man.  You really decide to be niche when you name your band Cuntsaw.  Cuntsaw.  All right, go ahead.  Yeah.  Decrepit Birth.  Death Angel.  I can't read that one.  Diet.  Diocese.  Oh.  Oh.  Deep Fried Abortion.  Oh.  Dying Fetus.  I, E-Y-E, Hate God.  Full Blown AIDS. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  Goat Whore.  God Dethroned.  Heaven Shall Burn.  Hell O, spelt like Jell-O.  Oh.  Impaled Nazarene.  The Jack Officers.  The Jack Officers.  That's a good one.  Jesus Chrysler.  Jesus Eater.  Uh, Jucifer.  Oh.  Kill a Priest.  Morbid Angel.  Uh, Mighty Sphincter.  Nails of Christ.  Mm-hmm.  Nunslaughter. 
[00:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Preschool Tea Party Massacre.  Oh, Jesus.  Pussifer.  Pussy Overload.  Rhino Clit.  Oh.  Rotting Christ.  Scrotum Staplers.  Sexual Orange Master.  Shit Scum.  Smother Teresa.  Oh, shit scum.  Uh, This Is Hell, Upside Down Cross, and Wall of Smegma.  Those you can't say on the air or play in their music.  What's wrong with Wall of Smegma?  It's a medical term.  They won't get you fired.  Why did this go viral? 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  I think it's just because it's a bunch of silly names.  Yeah, when I heard about this list, I thought it was like, you know, mainstream bands with  songs.  Yeah.  That bothered the Christian people.  I thought it was because of the second part of the list, where saying these names, which  aren't offensive, but will get you fired from the station.  Right.  I mean, all the names are offensive to people.  I mean, they're all...  Not Jack Officer.  Yeah.  Jack Officer is great.  All these bands named themselves specifically to offend people.  Right.  Of course.  You know.  But they're all funny. 
[00:29:30]  I'm sure the list just went viral because it's a hilarious list of names.  To read out loud.  We made it absolutely hilarious here, that's for sure.  You really took it to the next level, huh?  Wow, did we?  Yeah.  We had a whole bit about it.  You'll be a funny name for like a really crazy band.  I want to get a band together because I was in a band in high school, and I want to  call them the Lilacs.  You don't think that'd be funny?  The Lilacs.  That's pretty faggy. 
[00:30:00]  The second part of the list is also if you say any of these following, you'll be terminated.  Fall Out Boy, Nickelback, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber.  No, that's not true.  But that's a joke.  It's a metal station.  Oh, okay.  So, of course, they're just...  Right.  They're not offended by those things.  Right.  Heavy metal station.  Nice.  Heavy metal people don't like those bands.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Whew.  Jesus.  So, this is just some of the edge-of-your-seat stuff going on.  That's terrific.  National Girl Scout Cookie Day? 
[00:30:30]  Those are delicious.  I ordered mine.  They have a Girl Scout, a couple of Girl Scouts on CNN, and one of them looks like she dips  into the old prophets.  Oh, there's a little guy.  The old cookie prophets, that's for sure.  Oh, there's a little baby playing band.  Oh, I made one of it.  That's right.  By the time, man.  That's the one they showed.  Probably recorded it.  Oh, you did?  Just to make it feel good?  Yeah.  Nice shot, fucko.  Little kid.  Why would the dad let him do that?  I know.  The dad knows he's not making all those shots. 
[00:31:00]  No.  The dad did the fucking magic.  He edited that fucker.  Edited the shit out of that.  Took him months.  You're right.  You should tell him, yeah, he threw out his arm.  He can't fucking shoot hoops today.  Yeah, he's got an interesting...  Right.  He should just play the viral video that everyone's loving.  Tommy John surgery or some shit.  Yeah, nothing good could come out of him trying to do it live on TV.  The only good...  The only thing that will come of that is people leaving YouTube comments and say,  Show him on TV.  Fake.  Kid sucks.  He's a fucking asshole.  Epic Phil on Fox. 
[00:31:30]  It would be very funny if the father was just screaming at him on Fox in front of everybody.  Right in his face.  He's fucking shaking his finger at him.  Yeah.  Straight out of your fucking arm!  Like, he's just panicking.  The father's just panicking.  Oh, that would be horrible.  Poor little feller.  Poor little feller.  I got my Girl Scout cookies.  You did, did you?  I got too many nieces in my family.  Oh, is that it?  And every year, man, whatever niece calls me first, that's the one I order from.  Is that it?  So they got a little competition among themselves, and then I have to tell the rest of the nieces, 
[00:32:00]  Beat it.  I already fucking bought Girl Scout cookies.  You can't order a little bit from each niece?  Yeah, no, man.  I ordered six from one, and the rest are shut out.  That's how I work.  How many do you have?  Because I'm trying to teach them a lesson.  You gotta fucking be alert.  You gotta be competitive in this business.  You gotta be competition.  You gotta be a go-getter.  It's capitalism.  That's right.  Oh, she must have earned her eating badge.  Look at the size of that fucking heifer.  She's 12.  Wow.  Is she?  I have her safety to make my roads in the community a better and safer place. 
[00:32:30]  There's also a little competition, isn't there?  You learned about competition, right?  Told you a competition.  To get badges or to sell cookies, and then it makes you work a little hard, too, doesn't it?  We don't need no stinking badges.  I mean, I usually sell the most cookies in my church.  Oh!  She must have.  You were the one that I was always trying to be when I was always selling more cookies  than me.  I know.  I had a date.  My daughter was a Daisy.  I was a Brownie.  So we totally relate.  And we really respect what you do.  That's a great question.  Now, what's your most popular cookie? 
[00:33:00]  Brownie, you traitor.  Well, that's a great question.  It is the Thin Mint.  Everybody loves the Thin Mint.  What's your most popular cookie?  That's a great question.  This is our 95th year of selling Black Scout cookies.  We started in 1917.  In addition, what we love about the new box is that they're highlighting, actually, the five business  skills that girls are learning selling cookies.  Goal setting, decision-making, money management, people skills.  How do you talk to people?  How do you make that cold sell, you know, as people are walking up to you to buy your cookies?  And, of course, business ethics, which is so important. 
[00:33:30]  And, in addition, they're having fun.  You know, that's what's so important.  Because we serve girls 5 through 17 years old.  We're in every zip code in the country.  And we're in 92 countries in the world.  And they really are making a little bit better.  A hundred years ago, it was sewing, and it was mending, and it was things now.  I mean, the things that, you know, you can.  Is that the problem?  It's amazing.  Even the number of badges and the kinds of badges.  Now they get a fucking divorce badge.  You know, rape the fucking husband out of his money badge.  It's not like the old days.  Sewing.  Yeah.  Cooking.  I don't want to go into medicine and the law. 
[00:34:00]  And I think I might want to stay in New York.  Why don't you go into medicine?  Medicine and the law?  What?  I'd love to hear that.  I hope my brother is okay.  You'll be rattling pots and pans all pregnant.  I'm 16 years old.  And I want to be a broadcast journalist when I grow up.  Oh, that's good.  She can.  Well, at least she knows what she wants to do.  Be a broadcaster?  She's fat.  She's going to be a whole.  Great.  Tons and tons of cookies.  Tons and tons of cookies.  And, Anne-Marie, congratulations to you as well.  Thank you for joining us today.  All right.  Everyone wants to be number one, but in college basketball right now... 
[00:34:30]  Oh, shut up.  Wow.  That's just annoying.  They're talking about Girl Scout cookies on CNN?  Yeah.  Must be a slow news day.  Oh, the kid's still trying to make baskets, and now his father's basically saying,  no, he won't let him shoot anymore.  He's not doing it?  Sit, kind of snuggle next to me and watch NBA basketball.  We watched it on the laptop.  He'd watch the heat.  He would sit and watch like 20, 30 minutes an hour.  I always thought it was really sweet, but from the time he could walk,  he knew what to do with the ball and basketball.  Now they're showing the video.  Let's see him do it.  We can talk.  Oh, no.  It's a two-year-old sensation.  Why are you taking these videos? 
[00:35:00]  Oh, he missed the layup.  He missed the layup.  He missed the layup.  Nine shots.  Now he's hitting running shots.  Can you stand still and shoot?  No, he can't.  He's mostly spot-up shooting.  All right.  He made a layup.  He's running right up to the fucking net.  Tyce, that's a good job.  Mike, you little shit.  Tyce, what is that, a ball?  Man.  What's this?  Boo.  Fail.  Yeah.  Oop.  What's this?  It's one for three.  Oh, don't tease him.  Come on.  It's one for three.  Oh, my.  He made the fire shot.  In the video, we see a lot of trick shots. 
[00:35:30]  I also saw that even though he used this one, he's making him.  He just made another one.  Do you think that you would like to try this, Titus?  Titus, what's this?  A trampoline?  Should we do the lay on the trampoline shot?  Should we do the trampoline shot?  Here we go.  Titus, he's been brought up his whole life.  His father's treated him like a stall.  Will he hit this?  It really is.  He's laying on the trampoline, missing.  He misses.  Who misses?  Oh, he misses.  Oh.  Yes. 
[00:36:00]  The one for four.  I could do that.  Yeah, big deal.  He was not awesome.  He's a waste of life.  All right, enough with the ball.  This kid's fucking crazy.  This kid is going to be unbelievable when he gets older.  No, he's not.  And by the way, we have a special surprise for you.  And here we go from the NBA store for you two guys.  You're a big Heat fan, right?  I hope he grows one more inch his whole life.  Oh, my goodness.  Titus.  This is for you.  For me.  And here's what's more important.  Miami Heat jersey in New York.  Titus, do you like this shirt?  Oh, my gosh.  Do you want to play in New Jersey? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Is that so great?  Yeah, isn't that great?  All right.  I'm not going to fit him.  He's a baby.  There you go, Titus.  I know.  He's a full-sized jersey.  What a bad boy.  This may be the only time I've left you to compare to the NBA store.  Yes.  Wouldn't that be a good business?  And why couldn't they get something cool from the NBA instead of just going to the  store and buying a couple of jerseys?  Titus, let's stay in touch, okay?  He's probably already got a Heat jersey.  I'm trying to shake a kid's hand.  He's not doing any.  You think the father's going to be upset if he grows up gay and just wants to fucking,  you know, go into maybe decorating? 
[00:37:00]  Or he just wants to lay on a trampoline and be teabagged?  Is that something he would tell his father about?  No, but his father would know he'd walk in.  What happened to that trampoline I bought you?  Can you hear the bouncing?  You think the kid's practicing?  He's like, well, I still enjoy balls, Dad, but see?  I don't throw them.  Yeah.  Oh, the poor little kid.  He's not a good basketball player.  No, he's a fucking bust.  Fuck him.  Fucker.  He did all right.  Who cares?  Not great. 
[00:37:30]  I could have done that.  They love taking those viral video kids and putting them on the news, though.  But there are a bunch of people watching the news that don't have computers or whatever  that don't know viral videos.  Right.  They're sitting there going like, why the fuck is this kid on TV?  Yeah.  He sucks.  But who are those idiots that don't have a computer?  Old people.  There's a lot of old people watching Fox News that don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Old people don't know shit.  They're just all, I don't know.  What's this internet?  And now they're watching a toddler miss basketball shots.  And not understanding why he's even on the news.  Exactly.  They had the girl with the choo-choo train, which was two years ago that video was made. 
[00:38:00]  So she's older and she's just sitting there not saying anything.  Where was she?  She doesn't have that old wide-eyed face or anything.  She was on Fox yesterday, I think.  Your mic fell open.  Opie, your mic fell off of the clip.  How come that happened?  I sure wish I would have said something about this.  Yeah, mention it.  That is the gentlest little holding clip.  It gently holds the mic so that if you even tap it, it just falls right up. 
[00:38:30]  Opie, your mic fell.  This is dangling.  What happens with this Radio Wizard guy?  What do you mean?  Like, if I just tap this, it don't...  Your mic fell.  I talked about it two, three days ago.  See, but the...  This is like an easy fix.  The flap is up, though.  The flap is fixed.  Barely.  This one's starting to fall.  Yeah, that one's falling now a little bit.  What happens to this guy down the hall?  This is basic shit.  Ah, your mic fell.  Here comes Maz.  He's got a line on his plate.  As long as I don't touch him.  What happened when Mike keeps falling? 
[00:39:00]  Opie, Mike fell.  Opie's mic keeps falling.  What happened?  Comment?  Mars, comment?  No, if I push it all the way in tight, yeah, but...  It's not supposed to do that.  Oh, see, it keeps falling out like that.  It's supposed to be like this.  It's fine.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Wow, you get hanging from that.  It's supposed to be.  It's like the crazy glue hat.  I can hang a weight from that thing.  Opie, Mike fell again.  Opie, Mike.  Mine's fucking awesome.  Mine doesn't fall because it stands straight up like this, like a pecker.  Like a pecker. 
[00:39:30]  What happens with this guy?  Oh, Jesus.  Do we get a list of things he needs to do?  What happened?  Want me to start one?  What happened?  Oh, how many live reads we got today?  Sixteen.  We haven't even done any yet.  You're right.  You want to do one?  No, I was told yesterday.  You were told by who?  Radio Wizard.  Right.  On the way to the elevator, he caught me.  Right.  And he said that these reads are scheduled for a certain time.  That's right.  And we have to adhere to these scheduled times. 
[00:40:00]  No, we don't.  When we do a break at seven-ish, whatever, that's when we have to do the breaks that are scheduled  for that time.  Period.  I want you to know something.  Yeah.  You know how you end the show and you say, we'll see you on Monday.  And what do you like to do after that?  Get the fuck out of here as quickly as possible.  Incorrect.  You'll be doing four live reads after you end the show.  See?  So sit in that seat, mister.  So we end the show today at 9.50. 
[00:40:30]  I just held my breath.  Oh.  Well, you don't want to breathe on the mic and have it fall out of the clip?  It fell again.  Oh, your mic.  Oh, his mic fell out.  It's just a tap and it goes.  Yeah.  Mine doesn't fall.  Did you read some of the tweets last night from people?  What?  They were angry about the...  The gay shit?  No, no.  The reads.  Oh.  So many live reads.  They were angry at the gay shit.  It was fun.  I know.  It was hilarious. 
[00:41:00]  The show was off track and we did what we needed to do.  What was that?  It's a firm, bare-bottom spanking.  Firm.  Yeah, I thought it set us straight.  A good, bare-bottom spanking.  I held my breath, but I have to say this.  This is how stupid the radio wizard is.  Oh, come on.  And how stupid the sales department is at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  It goes all the way to the top.  Yesterday, we were doing a live read every 15 minutes in show.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  That is way more valuable to a fucking client than shoving...  How many live reads are we going to do this first break?  Four?  Yeah.  We're going to shove four live reads in the middle of a big, long fucking commercial stop  set.  The problem rises...  More people heard about these companies yesterday than they're going to hear today.  Right.  The problem rises with...  It's with the separation of the reads.  So say we have a...  Church and state?  No.  Oh.  Say we have a pajamagram.  Yeah.  There needs to be an hour or so between pajamagram reads, and when we do them a little more 
[00:42:00]  loosey-goosey in show...  Right.  ...becomes more difficult to time them out that way.  That's what I was told on my way to the freedom elevator, I call it.  Takes me to freedom.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  Your mic's staying put.  That's pretty good.  Oh.  Hey, hey, oh.  One tap.  Mic fell.  One little tap.  I hope he's mic fell.  Mic fell. 
[00:42:30]  I think the sales staff makes a lot of mistakes.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  What do you know now?  A little birdie told me that maybe there was a company who wanted to do a little advertising.  Oh, boy.  So they contacted sales staff, and I think they didn't hear back, but when they did hear back,  they got, like, a schedule of programming.  They got, like, the wrong thing back.  Oh.  So, um...  Was it Ford Motor Company? 
[00:43:00]  No, it wasn't one of that ilk.  But it was apparently, you know, someone called, my manager called Gary, and Gary actually fixed it.  Oh, my God.  But it was, uh...  You know, the sales department didn't send the right information.  Oh, phew.  It really is astounding.  Why would they?  Oh, God.  Just astounding.  I heard Mad Dog was fucking pissed off yesterday, too.  Oh, really?  Do we have that audio, maybe? 
[00:43:30]  Who's pissed off?  Mad Dog.  Kevin, what do you know about Mad Dog yesterday?  I heard he lost it a little bit.  It wasn't Mad Dog.  It was the guy after him.  Oh, okay.  They were doing a Sherry's Berries commercial, you know, for $19.99 or whatever.  Yeah.  Uh, the sales department fucked up the copy.  It's supposed to be $39.99.  We've been saying $19.99, too, I think.  Yeah.  That's what they said.  They said all the people have been saying, uh, 19, they've had the same copy for two days  or something.  Do we have $19.99 or $39.99 on our copies? 
[00:44:00]  Look at one of the reads.  Sam, comment.  Just Sherry's Berries, he says.  Yeah.  And let's make sure.  And by the way.  It's $19.99.  It says $19.  So it's $19.  But maybe it's a different.  Ours says $19.99.  Is that good or bad?  Uh, they were saying over there it's supposed to be $39.99.  I don't think so.  Ours says $19.99.  No.  This guy.  All right.  Yeah.  I swear.  Oh, yeah.  I swear.  You're confused.  It's starting at just $19.99, meaning that there could be stuff that costs $39.99 or 
[00:44:30]  $29.99, but it's starting.  It's starting at.  At $19.99.  Right.  Sam, will you fuck off?  Uh, no.  Oh, okay.  The answer then is no.  Who asked?  A lot of people just ask that, you know, on a daily basis.  No, I will not.  Oh, right.  You hear Mike Francesa?  Oh, God.  Two more guys got to him yesterday.  Yes, yes, yes.  Mike gets very defensive, man. 
[00:45:00]  Doesn't he?  One guy was asking him why he stutters, and he was telling the caller that he doesn't stutter  as he was stuttering.  As he was stuttering.  Yes.  And, uh, I liked when he just wouldn't leave it alone asking the guy what he does for a  living.  Yeah, yeah.  He gets so bent out of shit.  He really gets pissed.  I think it was on that Mentality, whatever the fuck it is, magazine or something.  Mentality Mag?  Mentality Mag.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  You know what else isn't good about fucking, uh, Mike?  He, he's on television. 
[00:45:30]  Like, you can see him.  And when he's taking calls, he's just sitting there, and he's looking at his phone, he's  looking down, which is fine, because, you know, we do that here.  You could listen and do that.  But it looks bad on television.  Right.  It looks like you don't give a flying fuck what these people are saying.  Right.  And, uh, yeah, it just gives a very bad impression.  Absolutely.  How does that boar have a radio, a TV show as well as a radio show?  I don't know.  It's amazing, isn't it?  Yep. 
[00:46:00]  There's no need for a visual element on his show.  By the by.  Here it is.  First two callers.  This was his first two callers of the day.  He takes a lot of calls.  Yeah.  As we all know.  Hit this.  I love this.  You told me yesterday, but I don't know about myself.  I have a Hall of Fame question.  What was it?  All right.  If, uh, you consider yourself a tough grader for the Hall of Fame, right?  Uh, yeah, I would say.  Yeah, the baseball Hall of Fame, right?  Yeah, I would say, yeah.  If there was, uh, if there was a Hall of Fame for, like, uh, stuttering and repeating 
[00:46:30]  yourself, would you put yourself in it?  Yeah, I, I, I don't, I never stuttered a day in my life.  Oh, you repeat yourself and stutter a lot, Mike.  I worry for you, you know what I mean?  I worry for you.  Yeah.  What's up?  What do you do for a living?  Uh, I'm doing a couple of things.  Wait, wait a second.  Are you ashamed?  Are you, are you, are you, are you, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.  What do you do for a living?  Uh, yeah, I'm an umpire.  For a, that's your, that's your full game, full employment, is your umpire? 
[00:47:00]  No, not necessarily.  Well, why are you, are you ashamed of what you do for a living?  No.  Then what is it?  Wait a second.  What is it?  You're repeating.  What is, wait a second.  What I said was, what do you do for a living?  I work in construction for a living.  That's my main job, construction.  Why were you embarrassed to say so?

[00:56:00]  seat sir what's up neil here he comes promoting promoting uh bailout how washington abandoned  main street while rescuing wall street oh nice some of that tarp stuff were you on the daily show  yesterday i was last night with john stewart yeah yeah yeah it's amazing show is it how was uh how  was john john is great i think he he yeah i read the book which is always nice he leans a little left 
[00:56:30]  though just slightly to the left well i'm kind of a lefty myself so yeah we could high five over there  we just got the book yesterday we didn't get a chance to read it they gave it to us yesterday  yeah it's not one of those oh i hate when that happens there's a reason why the publishing world  is in such great shape exactly right yeah i don't think it's a page turner i'm not saying that it's a  bad book but you know what you got to kind of sit with it for a while is what i'm saying you can't  digest all that info in two hours not one of those toilet books that you leave by that that was a 
[00:57:00]  compliment you know actually if you look on the back it's been described as a page turner really  i'm not gonna say but i'm just saying let me see i think somebody called it a page turner um  who's who called it a page turner let's see it might be in the front of the whole the whole list of  pages this book this book is a page turner there you go neil barofsky said  my wife said it was a page turner publisher publicist of course and i like the fact that  there's no pictures in your book pictures just take up fucking space man so what's uh what's the 
[00:57:30]  gist what's your take on uh what happened there uh with the bailout i mean essentially you know we  have this giant bank bailout right and 700 billion dollars congress passes this sort of incredible law  and it's supposed to do a number of things supposed to save the bank save wall street uh but it's also  supposed to do more than just that because you know when when treasury when the government  went when they went back in two thousand and eight and asked for all this money you know congress  said no originally it's in the way we're not going to do it uh... they said you know if you're going to 
[00:58:00]  do this you need to help people more than just a handful of banks and bankers uh... so they can  keep paying themselves billion dollars bonuses you gotta help homeowners were struggling getting thrown  out on the road on the street you gotta help small businesses so treasury made these promises in  order to get that money to bail out the banks but once they got the money they just didn't do it  right so you know it's that the gist is sort of how that all happened and why it happened so in  essence they acted exactly like the government who just takes in uh... revenue and uh... spends it  very irresponsibly uh... so what that's all they did pretty much is is just mimic uh... the government 
[00:58:30]  that uh... gave them the money anyway and essentially what happened was is that you know you had the  winners and the losers and you know this is a fair criticism of government and there's really no better  example so you had the the select few the goldman sachs the you know the the giant banks on wall  street which got all of this money no strings attached nothing to actually make it happen  well everyone else sort of got left behind did they pay the money back someone told me they paid  the money in advance with interest back they did uh... the biggest banks did pay it back um... with 
[00:59:00]  interest uh... overall the programs projected to lose about sixty billion dollars uh... because it did you  know it's a thirteen different programs under the tarp but the banks did pay the money back i think  they were still having a problem with the agi right yeah i g a g we're actually a g government's  out of a i g um overall uh... the tarp part of it they lost about fifteen billion dollars but  you're all in that you know overall you look at some of the other programs and they they made money  right right but it was all about more than just making money or losing money it was supposed to 
[00:59:30]  save our financial system and what we did is we took a broken financial system that that destroyed  the country and really brought the world to its knees and we didn't really fix it  you know we just put sort of like a band-aid over a gaping chest wound uh... uh... got some profits  up for the banks but all those broken things all the broken incentives are still in the system whose  fault because you look at it collapsed when bush was in office but then obama who's you couldn't  be more ideologically different than these two guys does the bailout it's it's almost like through 
[01:00:00]  total two totally different mentalities the system is still a disaster it doesn't matter who's running  things you know they're they're so different in so many ways but when i was down there they were so much  the same i mean i remember look as i said i'm i'm a left-leaning guy i'm a you know uh... i  contributed obama's campaign in oh eight all of that and i was a bush appointee i got appointed  by president bush that a background securities fraud and mortgage fraud and i'll be honest with you  i circled the day january twenty because when i got there it was so screwed up i mean just everyone  i was dealing with was so bowing to the to the the needs of the banks i was like okay everything's 
[01:00:30]  going to change on january twenty we're going to get a new treasury secretary new nothing changed  i mean even the exact words change like i you know part of my job was to find fraud right and  try to try to you know put up the right uh roadblocks so people couldn't steal from the program  and you know so as soon as i got there i saw they're just shoveling this money out like no care  um and so i said to them i said guys look you have this problem you have this problem you have this  condition we need to do this and they said look neil you don't understand these are banks they would 
[01:01:00]  never ever risk their reputation by putting profit over the goals of this program yes yes right i mean  this is sort of nonsense and you know at the time it was sort of like well where have you guys been  for the last couple years and these guys have proved they put profit over anything and of course where  they had been was goldman sachs and merrill lynch and bear stearns but when the the administration  flipped over nothing changed same words same attitude so you know i think a lot of times democrats  and republicans like to pretend they have real significant difference on some issues but when it comes to 
[01:01:30]  serving the interests of the banks and screwing everyone else you know it's all it's kumbaya there yeah that's the  one thing they could all agree on absolutely what is it what and who's the biggest like you know i  deal with the bank of america and it's it's it's so enraging to deal with a company that these companies  take bailouts and they still pay no interest to people if you have a checking account it's like  they're just disgusting you know that's part of the whole idea behind the ballot you know one of the  times some of the treasury guys would tell me that the whole idea was to help them earn their way out of  this right so they you know they took these huge bets had these huge losses we had to go in and basically fill 
[01:02:00]  the holes that they created with these huge losses and part of the way we did that is that you know  not just in tarp but through the federal reserve we would lend them money at zero percent and then  they would lend it back to us by buying our debt for like two or three percent so it's sort of like  guaranteed profits for the banks meanwhile they keep those interest rates so low so borrowers savers  people on pensions you know the elderly who are living on fixed income they're not going to get  absolutely screwed but guess what the good news record year for bonuses on wall street in 2010 
[01:02:30]  all right it's just leaving the rest of the country behind at least someone's making some  money right and how do they justify that like even in house how do they justify the paying bonuses like  that like it came in 2008 i mean i don't agree with what did pull out house they don't even think  about justifying it in their own minds they don't it's such business as usual this happens with every  business they they give themselves this these incredible bonuses you have to think you're doing  something wrong before you can be embarrassed about it right you know and they just don't think twice about 
[01:03:00]  no they don't think they're doing anything wrong they get mad if they're not you know getting  even more bonuses and you're talking about washington it's the same thing in washington right  they're so narcissistic i mean these people so are incapable of acknowledging that they're fallible  that they could actually make a mistake right and it's this ego that you just walk into and you know  one time i was i was in a meeting with with treasury secretary tim geithner uh now i guess he stepped  down the former treasury secretary and you know i was just trying to get him to be more transparent i've  had this crazy idea maybe we should tell the banks what they're doing with the money you know tell us 
[01:03:30]  what they're doing the money you have have actually a little bit of transparency so we know hey are they  doing the things that we want them to be doing like you know restoring lending and getting the  economy going again and it's not just like they told me that i was stupid and that i was playing politics  and i didn't understand everything you know geithner screamed at me cursed me out told me he was the most  fucking transparent secretary of treasury in this country's fucking history and who was i to come  in there and question it and like this was not like me really going at him i was just saying look 
[01:04:00]  you know you're hurting the reputation of this country you're contributing to the cynicism on open  anthony and everyone else who thinks the government's just pulling the rug over you know pulling the rug out  from under us and the wool over our eyes and you know that was the response it's not like oh well  let's let's think about it let's realize that everyone has lost their faith in government and do  something about it it's just to shoot the messenger wow yeah and and god it is so true because as much as  you want to hope that there's some kind of light at the end of the tunnel or somebody that's going to  be in there that'll change your image of this government that just covers everything up and 
[01:04:30]  irresponsible not really there for the people they're doing nothing to change that they're fighting  to preserve it and that's sort of the remarkable thing i mean even back in 2010 when we had regulatory  reform movement and there was bipartisan it's like almost hard to say those words but republicans  and democrats supporting a bill to break up the biggest banks and and sort of end this this giant  weapon of mass destruction right that caused so much problem and will do so again and you know who  lines up beside the banks lined up in the lobbyists playing up but you know who's the the biggest advocate 
[01:05:00]  for the banks tim geithner secretary of the treasury larry summers at the white house they're the ones who  defeat that bill we have broken up banks and are on the way to recovery but for the fact that it's our you  you know our democrat democrats in the white house who went to bat for wall street and saved this  status quo that makes them billions and leaves as i said just screws the rest of us just amazing  i don't know what do you see as far as as a light at the end of the tunnel what what what do you  think has to has to happen here well we got to break them up i mean you can't have banks that are so 
[01:05:30]  big i mean and you know you've seen it recently um you know the banks are are being sort of settling  these cases with department of justice they've committed crimes they've fixed interest rates  they've laundered money for terrorists and narcotic cartels and and basically they don't get charged  nobody gets any of them going to jail nobody's going to jail of course not right it's amazing  you say uh we got to break them up but how do we do that well there's a couple different ways but  but is it possible yeah of course it's possible okay but you know part of the reason why they're not 
[01:06:00]  going to jail is because everyone is so afraid that if we in charge one criminally charged one of them  that that will put them out of business and that'll bring down the entire financial system  right so you have to make them smaller but there's different ways of doing it you know we for after  the great depression we passed a law called glass eagle which which broke the banks up um you know  commercial banks and some of the more risky aspects of banking and that kept us safe and growing and  as a good economy for fifty years we can go back to that we could just put size caps let them figure 
[01:06:30]  out on our own how to get smaller but who's gonna be the guy that suggests all this and gets this going  what's amazing thing is that there's a lot of support you know even in congress on both sides  of the aisle and i think that's important thing this is not a democrat this is not a republican  not a conservative not a liberal because it just makes sense i mean it's basically everyone in  congress who's not getting all the money from the banks and not being inundated by those lobbyists  every day sort of look at this and come to the same common sense conclusion the problem is there's so  much power of the banks in the middle yeah in the white house in the treasury in the in the leadership 
[01:07:00]  again of both parties that keep this from happening but sooner or later we have an  unsustainable system this will lead to another crisis um and the only hope is that we fix it  before the next crisis how many years before the next crisis so i could get my money out  you know that's you know if i could predict that i'd be a billionaire right you know um but could  it be in the next year sure oh really next five years i mean it's so fragile that you know any big  external shock could could could kill it and there's just because the fundamental problems have not been 
[01:07:30]  fixed i got a real basic question why don't we get any real interest in our bank accounts anymore  oh because we come from a time where i think it was ten percent on your savings account and now you  don't even get one percent this is an intentional government policy by the federal reserve to keep  interest rates low and part of that reason again is it makes it easier for the banks um you know it's  also this idea that if you keep interest rates low um this will drive people uh out of saving money  and investing in things like the stock market which one of the reasons why the stock market is 
[01:08:00]  at 14 000 or near 14 000 right now is because of the same reason why you're getting no money in your  bank account i mean it's all interconnected and what it's doing is it's helping to inflate another  bubble it's trying to it weakens the dollar so it it it sort of artificially increases prices of  stocks um but meanwhile if you're relying on interest you know you're out of luck um and people  been out of luck especially retirees who are just getting drilled i mean they they retire with this  idea i'm going to get five or six percent on my savings uh-huh and now it's gone and now what do 
[01:08:30]  you do how smart you would help how accurate was ron paul because i like how he really seemed to be  the one who said things that were very unpopular when it came to finances and the treasury uh what is  your opinion on him and the way he kind of spoke about finances and what needed to be fixed you know  every now and then i'd agree with ron paul but it would be more now and then like abolishing the fed i you  know i understand i i say i think we need to fix things not abolish them um so you know some of  that stuff i thought was was a little bit too far but what was wrong with it i'm not saying i agree 
[01:09:00]  that i don't know enough about it but what was wrong with his idea of abolishing the fed oh god  i'm gonna get crushed on twitter for this i'm honestly curious i don't have his fans but i kind  of grew to like ron paul but i don't have the skills to to really say whether 100 he was right or do  anything yeah no i really don't i just kind of sit here and just look i'm eye candy but you know what he  was totally right on the banks i mean i think he he nailed that and what he said was right is that  essentially uh this is a form of socialism i mean we are this is we don't really have a capitalist  society with the banks because what happens is after you bail them out or even before you 
[01:09:30]  bail but certainly after you bail them out everyone assumes we're going to do it again right and this  gives them a huge economic advantage um you know here too big to fail sometimes it's hard to  understand exactly what that means but that means they get to operate with higher profit margins because they  can borrow money for less because people will lend them money not because they're a good company or  there's a good high likelihood because their business model they'll pay back but because  they know uncle sam is standing behind them and that gives them a huge economic advantage and i think  ron paul was was dead on when he when he sort of described this as a problem that needed to be solved 
[01:10:00]  um and you know he was one of the few guys running for president who actually advocated this very  necessary thing of breaking up the bank was him and um john huntsman were the only two i mean  romney and obama could have been the same person on this issue yeah yeah well they've over the course  of the years they've put the banks in such a powerful position that it now affects uh if you try to  if you try to change the banking industry you may trigger something that's going to uh hurt your 
[01:10:30]  constituency and you're going to lose an election over it so the best thing to do is try to just keep this  delicate balancing act between uh politics and banking and uh the fed uh to try to just keep but  like you said it's very fragile so i don't see any politician that really wants to do this and change  anything part of the problem is that notion that if we really you try to do something and restructure  the banks that it's going to cause all these problems it's total bullshit right it is total 
[01:11:00]  bullshit that's pushed by the bank lobby they've been pushing that for probably 60 or 70 years  the same bullshit line that oh if you do this it'll be the end of the world but you know what  the politicians they're nervous they they're buying this um and you know it it it becomes a self-serving  cycle i mean i think what's going to happen is either we're going to have another crisis and it's going  to be worse than the last one yeah and every i think at this point there's enough people out there  who've recognized that our system is broken in congress and academia and tv uh that this idea that we need 
[01:11:30]  to re totally restructure our system and go back to what worked uh will carry the day my hope and why  i wrote this book and why i'm out here is trying to convince people to let their members of congress  know we can't wait for the next crisis because we're going to be really screwed i mean some of  the estimates are they'll be cost five trillion dollars up front uh to deal with another banking crisis  and you know it's it's sort of this crazy thing if you don't fix what happened last time  why do you think it's not going to happen again yeah let me ask you this how does the individual um 
[01:12:00]  protect themselves from this next crisis you know i i i wish i i wish i knew the answer to  that question so i could do it myself is there oh really i mean but i don't know i mean so you're  just like us and you seem to have way more knowledge than the you know obviously the average person you  don't even know what to do to protect yourself no i mean buy gold i guess that's what ron paul would  suggest i'm sure that's what bill devane does no kidding bill devane's got a plane horses nice house  that gold thing you're you're convinced it's not going to go any higher it just keeps going higher and higher  i mean i think you know gold might might not be the right place to go i'm not really sure i mean 
[01:12:30]  what i'm trying to do all my effort is to keep it from happening again um but look you know a giant  financial crisis hits everybody there's you know except you know what you know what you should  probably do go get a job at goldman sachs then you'll be fine your bonus will double with the next  crisis that's probably the best thing which made off just kind of like uh you know the the the hitler  like in the nazi movement like like the figure like not the figurehead but because hitler was  nothing but the guy who they get him and they're like okay we got the bad guy like and there's so 
[01:13:00]  many other people that didn't uh get mentioned or noticed because there was this one that was so bad  is that kind of what happened with bernie madoff you hear a lot of that a lot of times especially  early on when they're saying you know where where are the indictments where are the criminal cases in  the department of justice they'll say well look we got bernie madoff and look bernie madoff was a  you know a terrible criminal and ran this you know multi been so many people lost money but he  really didn't have anything to do with the financial crisis he didn't cause a financial  crisis right i mean he's actually in some weird way he's almost a victim of the financial crisis 
[01:13:30]  and that that's you know when when the when everything started going down he can no longer  keep his his criminal because they kept everyone wanted their money out right right because everyone  wanted their money out because everything was going bad poor bernie yeah yeah i know that works  his whole life he enjoyed happy ending massages i connected to him uh but you're right so then they used  him as the poster child look how tough we are we got this guy who by the way you know walked in and confessed i  mean that's how they built that amazing casey geek walked into the fbi and said i just committed this  multi-billion dollar fraud would you please arrest me for the rest of my life now and gm how did they 
[01:14:00]  behave after the bailout do they behave honorably or uh yeah i mean look all these guys their biggest  tension is they wanted more money to pay themselves more bonuses and they complained and whined and  catch like the rest of them oh you know we can't compete if we don't pay our ceo x millions of  dollars um but you know ultimately okay i mean there's one funny thing i talk about in the book is that  you know that in 2010 they said we paid back the government right there was this whole thing  um they took out yeah they took out commercials and and tim geithner issues a press release and 
[01:14:30]  joe biden has a press conference gm paid us back so again my job was to investigate so i looked at  the scratch the surface a little bit and i found out that what they they did in fact pay back the loan  with other tarp money so they had tarp money in one account it was an escrow account and they used  that to pay it back and so it's you know it's this whole giant shell game mom would call that robin peter to  pay paul that's exactly right and you know so you know we go out with that but but look i mean you  know i i i i i've uh i've always driven american car but i actually switched over to ford uh after 
[01:15:00]  the crisis and they didn't take any ballot money so you uh you were appointed by bush how does that  appointment happen like did you actually know him or did it go through a bunch of uh names and yours  was just the most qualified name or yeah it was the craziest thing so i was a federal prosecutor  here in manhattan for eight years and i did uh narcotics work i used to i i on the side you mean  i wish i have more money today uh no i was down in columbia we indicted the uh the narco terrace 
[01:15:30]  the farc i did that for a number of years and then i did um securities fraud uh case against one of  the big commodities giants on wall street refco and then i started a mortgage fraud group in 2008 going  after you know these scumbags were really you know really contributed to the crisis through  through rampant mortgage fraud and so when they when the tarp bill got passed congress created this  brand new law enforcement agency slash audit agency uh with the horrible name sick tarp which is which  is what i was called and um you know my boss the u.s attorney asked me if i wanted to do the job i 
[01:16:00]  basically said no i don't want to go to washington i was getting married pretty happy here um but he sort  of uh appealed to my greater sense of patriotism and uh and i told him i said mike you know i'm a  democrat i contributed to the obama campaign like i don't really think i'm going to get a george bush  appointment he's like oh no no it's a merit appointment i you know sort of waiting for  the fairies and unicorns to come down to give an obama contributing democrat a bush appointment  uh but it really was i have to say when i went through that process no one asked me  what my politics were or what i care i didn't really know anyone in washington i just think i had the 
[01:16:30]  the right resume because you know back then tarp was going to buy mortgages and mortgage-backed  securities these bonds made up of mortgages it didn't end up doing that but if that was the  idea having a prosecutor spent a lot of time investigating locking people up for it seemed  like that's the guy that you want in there yes i think it was you know it was one of those things  where actually like i don't know i never thought that actually happened in government i always thought  it was the guy with the biggest campaign contributions who got the job but um you know what i think it  really was jim i think they didn't give a shit like you know it's it's october 2008 everyone's going home  they're packing their boxes throw someone in there borowski why not he's good he's good too 
[01:17:00]  did you meet uh bush no i never met bush you got a picture with bush nah i would have liked that  you got a picture with the president no actually i do you do awesome yeah me and clinton oh clinton  this is actually so i never met met obama he was an intern at the white house  i could see that on your sweater what's up there uh it's a funny story so i never met obama um i really  obviously i would have really liked to have met obama and um there's a single through congress 
[01:17:30]  of bill was called the special inspector john it was that it was bill about me it was about giving  my agency some some expanded power and i thought okay this is going to be really cool because when  a bill passes congress president has to sign and they have a signing ceremony so one of my staffers  calls over the white house and says you know neil would really like to go over and be at the  signing ceremony gets picture taken and they said back oh no no no we're not having one for for this  bill he's just going to do it privately i'm like okay you know at this point i've been pretty out  there with my criticisms of the president the way they were doing things so about two months later  i'm at with senator mccaskill who was the senator who sponsored the bill i said oh senator thank you 
[01:18:00]  so much for doing this was such an important bill and she goes oh it was great and we just had the  loveliest signing ceremony with the president oh man they just lied to me because i guess they didn't  want me to meet the president but uh why the hell did they want that how do they i think you know i  they're very thin-skinned in washington and you start criticizing people they you know they notice right  wow so that was my one shot at glory and what the bastard and you know you prosecute i didn't know  you prosecuted the the colombian like the the connections uh the how do they actually get money 
[01:18:30]  into an american bank like especially if you're like you're you're you're drug dealers and there's  not much legitimacy to what you're doing how do they do that you know they're sort of all different  ways but a lot of what they started doing um back when i was doing this in the middle of the last  decade is that they had trouble getting money into the banks united states so they would actually  smuggle the u.s dollars out of uh the you know so they bring the drugs here sell the drugs here for  u.s dollars um but they actually bring the dollars smuggle dollars out of the country put it in foreign 
[01:19:00]  banks like mexico uh deposit it and then use then send it back to the united states um and then use that  to buy products which they would then send down to colombia and sell and that's how they would get  their pesos so it's sort of a uh it would be a pretty complicated thing now it helps when the  biggest banks like hsbc which just got rung up not criminally of course you know no criminal indictments  you know helps the order of 800 million dollars which was this recent case you know these are big  banks that were actually helping them do it so that sort of helps as well uh but it's very it's 
[01:19:30]  pretty complicated how do you get that much money out of the country actual yeah like solid real paper  money you know they would in trucks in you know we in and can't soda cans they would hollow out and  you see you know things of hundreds i mean we we see money in so many different ways i mean the  creativity was was sort of everywhere what was the best one you saw wow i thought the soda cans  were pretty cool yeah that's pretty good first time i heard of that one but you know it's you  can sue all the effort in the world to get the drugs in but it doesn't mean anything to you if you 
[01:20:00]  can't get the money out can't get the money out right yeah why don't they prosecute criminally like  how are you if you're like i guess in mexico they don't ask as many questions when you show  up with cash at most of those banks they don't play the same banking system we do oh i don't  think the mexican banks give a shit how much american dollars they love it i'm sure you know  but it is it's it's an incredible thing though because when i was prosecutors years and years ago  we extradited a guy from columbia who's just a money launderer for uh one of the cartels he  laundered about 1.7 million dollars we tried him we convicted and put him in jail for 10 years 
[01:20:30]  when hsbc recently settled their case by the way no criminal charges 800 million dollars of of  norte valley one of the biggest cartels money laundered you know zero jail so if you're a little  guy you get 10 years but if your bank that's big enough that you're that if they indict you they'll  bring down the entire financial system six weeks of earnings they paid and then walked right out the  door wow damn who is it in the bank like like we have problems here with management because it  becomes this corporate structure where you can't really pin it on anybody yes if we have a question 
[01:21:00]  they they point at the ceiling and go ah it was kicked upstairs and the board or this nameless  faceless it's just this nameless face like you can never get an answer as to who the hell put a name  to this thing that happened sounds like government yeah yeah exactly exactly is that pretty much one of  one of the defense tactics they use oh yeah i mean that's always the defense tactic like oh i only  knew this little tiny piece of it but you knew this piece right right but look at that look if it was 
[01:21:30]  easy right i mean they wouldn't do it i mean it's like you know the idea is to try to make money by  do by building you know uh defenses in while they're committing the crime yeah but that's when you that's  you know what you do then then you indict the organization because ultimately you know and then you  start putting pressure but look crimes are committed by people uh and you can't launder 800 million  dollars drug dealer money and not have a few people who were in charge and and in this case  i mean people on the very high up in the company knew that there were problems and ignored those 
[01:22:00]  problems why because they're making a lot of money laundering money for the cartels so why wouldn't  they go after them and not collapse the bank and just pull a few bad i hate to say bad apples out of  the tree so i won't but you know i'm thinking it um without without knocking the whole tree down why  can't they do that because those executives are replaceable and some other vulture will fly in and  take their spot so why don't they do that and that's what they need to do i mean you're absolutely  right and i think you know right in 2008 2009 when things were really really still teetering on the  edge they probably couldn't do that like even if they went after the executives the threats of the 
[01:22:30]  organization you know because there was so much instability uh that it would have undone  basically all the billions of base trillions that they spend in saving them but you know now today i  think they can but part of the problem i just wrote something about this is that whole concept that  whole doctrine and i call it the geithner doctrine after our treasury secretary a former treasury  secretary that you know you that all all the system stability is dependent on protecting these  organizations at all costs because anything happens to them that sort of takes root and it spreads and  it's sort of an emergency thing in 2009 but then it becomes institutionalized by by 2013 yeah and 
[01:23:00]  that's part of the problem that's why we really got to go after this i mean and we got to go after it  on every front political front regulatory front um because otherwise as i said you know you can't have  organizations that know that they commit crimes and will not get punished and expect them not to  commit crimes yeah i mean right if i mean think that's what happened on the street right now if  anybody could go in to any denny duane reid put their hand in the cash register walk out of the money  knowing that it wouldn't they wouldn't get caught you know what would happen to be anarchy and we'd have 
[01:23:30]  a lot of crime and instability that's what's going to be happening in our banking system i'm bummed we  didn't get this sooner uh... to promote properly uh... i did the break uh... before jenna's here yeah yeah  no we promoted it properly it's called bailout uh... it's it seems fascinating i wish we had more  time to read it beforehand but really really interesting to hear what happened and uh nice  to know the republicans and democrats are just equally awful they really are equally awful yeah  and equally not working in our best interest exactly just creeps neil thanks uh thank you very 
[01:24:00]  much hey thanks govin this is kind of a big thrill for me so thank you guys that's very very cool  thanks thanks man we'll be right back you're listening to opie and anthony  sirius xm  sirius xm sirius xm the opie and anthony show  jesus is crazy  jesus is crazy i just talked 
[01:24:30]  shove food in your mouth talk shove some more food in your mouth  it's cray  got to get our next uh guest in here  yes indeed jenna it's uh jenna miscovich hill  we'll take a seat hello jenna how are you we're on the air so you know we just can't have fun yeah we  just like bring people in right on the air good you you might have said something  miscovich we're saying the name right it's miscavage but 
[01:25:00]  miscavage i knew we even wrote it out phonetically and still screwed it up  i said it properly james did you say miscavage i certainly did yes i think i said it right too  and of course uh your book my secret life inside scientology and my harrowing escape  beyond belief beyond belief it's uh wow your uncle runs the church yes that's right your uncle  runs the church of scientology that's a pretty powerful position yeah yeah it's weird like where 
[01:25:30]  do you begin almost like there's so many you hear scientology talked about so much and this  it's become like this scary ominous thing like oh you want scientology coming after you  and so what is it about this uh group that makes that uh impression on people  i mean i i know they're obviously very litigious and so that's definitely a concern for a lot of  people you know but even you know when i originally spoke out in 2008 you know they had me and my 
[01:26:00]  husband followed by pis for like a month and they um they were also having like meetings with my  parents-in-law his parents and trying to get them to disconnect from us or silence us so i mean it's  you know it's understandable that people would be scared what are they trying to hide so much of  because they are very secretive there's these things they don't want people talking about  anything that happens on the inside what is the danger of this exposure i mean because it's like 
[01:26:30]  they want to appear as some sort of benign self-help religion and they're not they're an abusive  and destructive organization really what is their end game like what is their goal if that's what  they are what is the what is their what motivates them and what moves them that's a good question i mean  it's hard to say exactly you know but if i if i had to guess i mean it's all about power when you're 
[01:27:00]  there you know i don't think that there's one person singularly who's getting like super rich out of it  i mean my uncle he obviously gets treated so much better than any of the other members that are  there you know his apartments are more luxurious or whatever but i mean it's not enough that i would  say that it's only about that it's not he hasn't taken the money and ran so i would definitely have to  say that it's it's about power a power issue are you worried about being sued um no i mean i know that 
[01:27:30]  i'm telling the truth in my book so when did you get in at what age um that you remember yeah no um  well i was born into scientology right but when i was two my parents joined the c organization which  is like the inner core of the church it has its most dedicated members and they signed billion year  contracts built in here yeah how close are you by the way to fulfilling your billion year contract 
[01:28:00]  um but um you know they live communally it's like their clergy you know they they manage the  rest of the church of scientology and you know they work like 14 hour days seven days a week and  they get little to no time off they make like 45 a week wow the next question was when did you start  realizing i i don't want to be doing this anymore i mean how old are you now about i'm 29 29 yeah so 
[01:28:30]  how many years ago when you finally said i i don't want this well it wasn't it was in 2005 when i finally  left right yeah but you felt probably these feelings way before that right yeah like because my point is  you were probably scared to come forward and say you know what i i gotta get out of this yeah it was  definitely a process that's just how it works especially when it's something that you've been  you were born into it you know you don't know any different i mean our contact our contact with  non-scientologists was like zero really so when you're there you don't know what's normal 
[01:29:00]  you know so it was just a huge process and you know eventually i left and what was the first kind of  chink in the armor for you like that you went wait a minute what is this what was the first time you  you remember thinking that or when you got that bug yeah well i mean you know from when i was six  till i was 12 i was at this boarding school um and we only saw our parents once a week we did manual 
[01:29:30]  like heavy manual labor four hours every day you know um and so when i was 12 you know so that was  already crazy but i didn't i thought that i was crazy because i wanted to see my parents but like so when  i was 12 i was sent to florida for training but then they said now now you're in the sea organization  which is the group i was talking about before and and basically from when i was 12 till i was 18 i only  saw my mom twice and i only saw my dad four times and the majority of those times it was less than an 
[01:30:00]  hour and so that that was like i i at one point wanted to go back and they wouldn't let me i wanted to go  back to california where my parents were and they they just would not allow me and i was like  why why why were your parents allow that i mean they were in obviously but yeah how would how would  they be okay with that that's a good question i know it is but i'm kind of mad like how would they  accept i'm i'm a father so i can't even imagine just saying goodbye to my kids for yeah no but i can't 
[01:30:30]  imagine just going all right you're 12 at what age you said 12 right so 12 just saying goodbye to your  kids and basically not really seeing them you know for six years yeah totally i mean yeah i i do  struggle with the same thing but my parents were also in it when they were kids you know so i mean my  mom joined the sea organization with her whole family when she was 13 and so i understand like more 
[01:31:00]  than anyone that like basically like the control they have on your mind and that you know you're  basically brainwashed and you think that you know you're you're saving the world when you're there  you think that you know you're giving up the time with your kid to for a better to make the world a  better place for them well for the next billion years too yeah yeah exactly and so like you know part  of me is like well i don't think i would care anyways like i i still couldn't do that to my kids but at the 
[01:31:30]  same time i haven't been in that position you know um and even now i would i would obviously be more  aware of those situations yeah yeah do you have a relationship with your parents now yeah are they  still in it no they left they actually left before me oh okay yeah that made it easier for you to leave  yeah and they helped me so today as well hold on so do they call you all right look we're out  we're gonna get you out of this that must have been a good day no actually well no they  left when i was 16 and i left when i was 21 when i was 16 they tried to get me to leave with them 
[01:32:00]  and i didn't go wow because i didn't really i mean by that time since i was four years old i'd been  seeing them once a week and you know from when i was you know i only saw them two times since i was 12.  so you had more of a bond almost with scientology and the scientologists and with them yes i mean  you know friends was like everything because family was like nothing basically what was their catalyst to get  out um well it talks a little bit about it in my book but i mean you know my mom um you know told me 
[01:32:30]  how she witnessed my uncle doing some beat like beating staff beating staff yeah for what for  infractions or as part of a hazing process no like because the guy got in trouble yeah so and you know  just other crazy things that were going on at the time she just said we're getting out of here for  the record we beat our staff when they misbehaved yes we actually want to beat a few of them to death 
[01:33:00]  justified yes it's not too crazy to beat a staff yeah so far you've not turned me against scientology  when it comes to beating a staff i think that's something we should all do more of actually we  could all learn from that um i'm not saying it's all bad what is the most closely guarded or secretive  aspect of it because for some reason like you look at catholicism we all know what the commandments  are there's a lot of inner workings of the church that we don't understand but we understand what the  the tenets of the church are what what is the most secret part of scientology or thing that they worry 
[01:33:30]  about leaking um well you know that stuff about the aliens and the volcanoes i don't know what that no  what is that oh gosh it's like the whole basis of uh yeah scientology yeah well you don't know about that  when you're in scientology until you reach a certain level like you have to receive a certain amount of  training and counseling and it can take years and you know the public scientologist has to pay a lot  of money before they get there whoa and like so this is like totally confidential i mean it's in locked 
[01:34:00]  rooms with like all sorts of security measures you know if you have that information in a briefcase it  has to be attached to you and you get like like um confessionals every six months to make sure you  haven't like told anyone but but it did get out i mean it yeah eventually from south park from yeah  that's where i learned about it wow yeah when i left and whoa yeah and they teach you that if you find 
[01:34:30]  out about it beforehand that you will like go crazy or that you'll be like you'll get hurt you'll be  physically injured and i remember trying to like you know reconcile that when i was there like  how if i learn about this will my body get hurt like i was like yeah mechanics of that right yeah but  yeah so that's really like what they they don't so they they didn't want that out there so so many 
[01:35:00]  people would go in and and you're like leveling up as they say like a role-playing game and uh then you  reach a point they go okay look this is how it is as these aliens right and they like killed a bunch  of these people and you know you got these bad elements of those things in you and it's cleansing  you of that i heard a rumor and i don't know how i don't know if it's true or not but that when tom  cruise found out what exactly was i guess whatever you want to say the man behind the curtain or the 
[01:35:30]  secret or the great reveal however they phrase it that he was like a little freaked out by that  um yeah does that happen to people a good way or bad not a good way like that's what it like okay  yeah ashton kutcher to come out and tell you but again that's just i don't know if that's true or not  but that was what i heard wow yeah i heard that too that that had happened like before he sort of came  back but i have no idea if that's true what is the um allure of uh the celebrity is it kind of a 
[01:36:00]  uh pr thing is it something like that because and and why do you think so many celebrities are  uh drawn to it um well a lot of excuse me a lot of the celebrities that are there um thank you um  are born into it like lisa marie presley or juliette lewis erica christensen back they're actually their  parents were into it wow but scientology actually targets celebrities and you know they know that 
[01:36:30]  people are interested in the lives of celebrities and they know that if they talk about it that  people are going to hear about scientology and they'll right hopefully get people in more people  in when you audit like and you and you do these confessionals uh i have a couple of questions about  leveling what is the difference say between being a level one and a level two and i think it goes all the  way up to what is it like a some os or os eight or something is the highest you can get or whatever  what's the difference between like one level and two or two and three oh you're talking about the ot 
[01:37:00]  levels yeah but let's say starting from the beginning what is the like how do you what do you how do you  know you've leveled up um well the in scientology they have like a curriculum which i hope this isn't  too confusing but like on on one side is all the training you have to do what no i'm just kidding  no i know that no but on the other side is all the counseling that you're supposed to do  and so it you start at the bottom you can't skip and then you know so there's grade one grade two  grade three grade four then you then you reach clear and then above that is the ot levels what 
[01:37:30]  does clear mean clear is supposed to mean that you are free from your reactive mind which is like your  bad subconscious thing so they kind of walk you back right they don't they go through every bad memory  and they think as you go through a bad memory you cut it's being wiped away almost it's almost like a  pac-man thing where they look at each memory is being gobbled up and removed to for visual ways  that how it works yeah that's actually a kind of a good explanation like they think that if you view  the memory in its entirety that it will disappear mm-hmm that it won't hurt you anymore yeah if you but 
[01:38:00]  you have to go back to an earlier similar memory and and this is and by the way during all this that's  going on it's just money is being poured out of these people's pockets and into scientology right  yeah and that's the thing this this thing about the xenu and the aliens or whatever who's xenu  he's like supposed to be a galactic overlord who like was trying to solve some overpopulation 
[01:38:30]  problem on some planet some somewhere and i love how you talk about it and start laughing it's like  jesus wait wait finish that thought though and then what happened yeah how did he solve the  population problem i i mean i hope i have this like totally right because i only learned about  it after and by that time i was like obviously taking it with a grain of salt yeah but um and he  like so he like threw people to earth or no first he like put them in some volcanoes and flooded them with 
[01:39:00]  some kind of pictures i don't know how it's supposed to work wait there was some atom bombs used yeah  yeah yeah yeah the atom bombs yeah so xenu uh was was brought into people's knowledge by uh l ron hubbard  who was a fiction writer yes a science fiction writer and uh people now follow it yes okay amazing yeah maybe  how did this how did this all begin um um scientology well it originally was like it was originally 
[01:39:30]  dianetics right which is the book that he wrote and it came out in like 1950 and it was like  it was all about what was his info based on well if that's it depends on who you ask i mean to him he was  like a nuclear physicist and a philosopher you know but if you know other people you know say that he's a  complete fraud and he made up the places that he got his you know degree he made up everything 
[01:40:00]  basically but then but in his mind that's he was a science fiction writer and now you fast forward and  all these people are uh believing his theories yeah so strange yeah how that begins yeah our auditing  sessions oh sorry we're gonna finish your thought in a minute okay oh no well one other thing i was  gonna say though is like the thing about the aliens like by the time you reach that level in  scientology you've invested so much money right so much of your time that it's like you almost like 
[01:40:30]  have to believe it because it's like oh my god or you have to break down that you wasted right all that  time energy money exactly everything you must feel like a sucker or a fool for for going for it so you're  like yeah xeno and that's why it's a big secret because you don't want everybody to realize that you  bought it too is that what it is if you walked in day one and they spelled it out for you that door  would be opening for with people leaving in droves i just don't understand how this religion just  caught on i'm stuck on that i'm sorry i just don't understand it there's new religions all the time you 
[01:41:00]  hear about them in the news but why did this one catch on yeah with powerful people too i mean um well  with dianetics it had like bold claims like it you know we can cure all psychosomatic illness which  they said was like 70 of all illness or you know we can raise your iq and so at first it was like  a science and so it was self-help so people you know came in for that and you know they started 
[01:41:30]  making groups and whatnot and then you know like the fda started coming down on them to sort of prove  some of these claims and then at that point it became a religion i mean isn't that when the spiritual  got introduced kind of now you can now all right now that makes a lot more sense yeah had to come  up with some kind of spirit yeah they had to twist it make up a story exactly they had to twist it  because yeah yeah you don't have to prove it's that faith thing yeah now you don't have to prove  anything anymore exactly and people are less likely to be skeptical about a religion because nobody can 
[01:42:00]  prove their own religion right you know you can yeah i got i got one question for you you've been out eight  years right uh do you believe in any religion or spirituality like where's your mind at nowadays  i mean i'm pretty non-religious just because like i've spent my whole life sort of being told that  you know this is the way things are and now i'm kind of like i just believe what i can see with my own  eyes but are you exploring other religions or are you just i'm done so you're basically an atheist i guess 
[01:42:30]  huh i mean i don't want to say atheist like because i'm like not like against all religion  not that all atheists are or whatever but i don't know i just i just i'll just say that i'm not  religious i mean but um i mean i have two kids you know like i've spent like more of my life in  scientology and some religion than i have outside of it and so i'm not like looking to spend a lot more  of it like looking into religion how old are your kids um my daughter is 11 months nice wow yeah and 
[01:43:00]  my son is gonna be four on saturday i ask you that is it hard to bond with them knowing what you went  through with your parents no like the opposite it's like yeah no not at all i mean they're like i don't  know like now i can see like you know when something happens to you it's like oh i'll be fine you know  but now that i have my own kids it's like you know how vulnerable they are and how innocent they 
[01:43:30]  are and it like i mean it makes your blood boil to think of these things that happen so you know i  stay at home with my kids i i work hard not to make the same mistake that's what my world is about  right now are you uh does it affect you um that you know it was pretty much wasting your youth do you do  you have um resentment and well obviously like that kind of like sucks sometimes yeah but i mean  what's cool about having kids is like you know i sort of get to have like a childhood that i didn't 
[01:44:00]  get to have like playing around exploring kids like yeah yeah they really bring you out of your shell  you know you gotta do a lot of stupid things to entertain them and so that brings you back it really  does yeah and you have a good relationship with your parents you said yeah yeah definitely i mean  obviously i had some questions like well how was this allowed to happen but you know in the end we  can't we can't change the past and they are really great grandparents to my kids and and you got out  of the church uh well scientology around 21 you said yeah did you go through a wild period no not really 
[01:44:30]  i mean i was like so boring because like i i don't know like normal things are wild to be anything  by the way i watch tv you know like that's how wow like yeah so no i didn't and plus i was already  married so okay okay i didn't mean it in that way i mean like maybe drinking maybe uh start smoking pot  you know no not really sorry i'm boring our auditing sessions where you you kind of tell everything in 
[01:45:00]  your life is it possible i've always wondered which are those things documented or recorded absolutely yes  i mean not only is the person who is the auditor writing down everything you say it's supposed to be  confidential but whatever um and but there's almost always a video camera in the room and it there's  actually a story about it in my book where it talks about you know me saying turn off the camera turn  it off and trying to get i mean they actually like if you try to leave these rooms before they're done 
[01:45:30]  with you they actually physically hold you in the rooms and talks about that in my book so is it possible  that there are people who are just say of celebrity status who may uh who realize that wow at a very weak  point i said some extraordinarily incriminating things on video yes um maybe admitting whatever  it would be homosexuality or other things that now i don't have control over that video 
[01:46:00]  what are you talking about but you know what i'm saying that to me is a very  yes absolutely i mean that is highly possible so where where would those tapes i don't mean the exact  address but who's in charge it's almost like when j edgar hoover died everybody was scared to kill him  before because they didn't know where his files were so where what happens to these files once these  tapes are made wow um well i don't i don't think that all the tapes are kept like i but i mean 
[01:46:30]  definitely the written down information is they're stored in there they're stored in folders you don't  think the tapes are kept like not even on hard drives now that the space would be so minimal  maybe i bet the juicy parts i bet some things that they could use they they probably know what's  important and you know if if uh tom cruise is talking about a dream he had back when he was five  uh or he starts talking about something that might maybe would be like oh well that'll keep him from leaving  yeah i mean i think that they're they're like excuse for recording is that it's for you know they're 
[01:47:00]  making sure that the auditor was operating the e-meter properly oh sure yeah what's the e-meter  it's the um it's it's like sort of similar to a lie detector and um it has the soup cans that you hold on to  yeah yeah you hold on to the cans and it has like a dial with a needle and it's it  basically supposed to measure resistance which they think comes from your mind i think um as a  matter of fact i think the time machine from um napoleon dynamite had more credibility than the 
[01:47:30]  oh i forgot to put in the crystals what kind of uncle is your what kind of guy is your uncle i mean uh  we hear your uncle we hear so much about him and just from your own experience i mean what what type of a  guy is he would you say he's a guy who genuinely believes everything and and wants to make the  church a certain way or is he a ruthless guy or is he uh you know what kind of a guy is he i mean he's  definitely like all of the like he's ruthless but he can also be really charming i mean he didn't become 
[01:48:00]  tom cruise's best friend i'm sure by like showing his like dark side you know or being a jerk you know  so he can be both he can be very two-faced you know he's but he's definitely has a lot of like  force behind his words when he talks to you so he's very much feared and also very much loved inside  of the church you know so he can he can sort of switch you know um but you know that would be my  question to him you know do you even really believe this anymore or is it just about power 
[01:48:30]  you know i don't know i gotta i i got a question that jim norton desperately wants to ask  do you have a picture with tom cruise no i've never met tom cruise wow that's funny yeah you've  never met him i i was just like some like niece somewhere you know couldn't your uncle have arranged  that yeah he could have but like i mean we weren't like bff you know i mean me and my uncle i actually  had a i mean i definitely saw him i saw him more than i saw my own parents but um 
[01:49:00]  i had a better i was closer with his wife my aunt shelly now and she now this is interesting too  like now your aunt shelly how long were they married because she's not been hurt from in a  while correct yes that's correct what what what exactly what do you know about that or what what  i don't want to say it wrong she's been missing she just what one day didn't show up for work or  no i don't think that they're saying that she didn't show up for work i think that they're saying  that they haven't seen her with him in his public appearances i guess so and i mean the church is 
[01:49:30]  saying she's still there i mean has anybody seen her publicly publicly no but they probably haven't  seen any of the other seorg members publicly either because they're like guarded around you know there's  usually gates around these compounds and that sort of thing so do you think that she's alive  i think that she is yes i mean i i obviously have no idea so anything i would say is just speculation 
[01:50:00]  but i mean it you know it just sounds to me like she got into trouble and she got demoted and you know  she probably has so much information and what not that they're sort of keeping her somewhere where she  wouldn't be seen publicly or you know wouldn't really be exposed to the outside world but i mean not  not like in like a basement i wouldn't like i mean but just like you know at a lowly job or something  like that are you the biggest or say is it an embarrassment for them that you are out being 
[01:50:30]  i mean with the same last name uh as the as the i guess the the head of scientology i mean you're not  just some low-level guy that got involved at one point i mean you're legit and they cannot discount  you by saying oh she doesn't know what she's talking about so how do they handle you how do they deal with  you i mean i think that i i'm just like guessing that it's probably a touchy subject for them because  you know anything they kind of say bad about me it's like i was in scientology my whole life you 
[01:51:00]  know reflection on them yeah yeah so i'm like a product of that and then on the other hand you know i am  you know obviously my uncle's the head of the church and so it would look bad on them to be attacking  their own family even though yeah they don't care about family and so i think that that kind of makes  me feel a little bit more safe than maybe somebody else would coming out about it is it harder because  we used to see videos like of people like being like you know people scientologists yelling at somebody 
[01:51:30]  and i don't even know if they're real scientologists but that's what the impression i was given is that  these were videos of scientologists yelling at people who had left um is it harder for that to happen  in the age of the internet where everybody kind of has a voice now do you think it's have they lost  what you would see as power i definitely think so i mean that yes i think that's a huge thing you know  they they kind of have like will suffer the consequences of those kind of actions  yeah yeah it's it's you say they're very litigious which they are yeah but with so many people now 
[01:52:00]  and so many avenues to express yourself it doesn't seem like they can go after everyone like they  used to because now it's anybody who has a blog um can get a lot more information out there than  somebody who's just shoving pamphlets under windshield wipers uh in the old days um so that must limit their  power base also to that threat of lawsuit it's still there but it doesn't seem to be as um as huge as it 
[01:52:30]  used to be yeah exactly and now also the more people who know they're litigious they probably  are like trying to be like well no we're not and so uh yeah i'm just guessing but yeah and so they  don't want to like prove that right by like being suing everybody yeah exactly wouldn't they also in  a lawsuit don't they also have to expose documents or whatever like if you say something don't they all  of a sudden become or any group that you're that sues you becomes vulnerable to say if you say that  they're let's say you say any group is full of shit well then don't they have to open up and show 
[01:53:00]  no this is this this and this may be things that a group wouldn't want to reveal yeah i mean but  scientology is so complex like people wouldn't even like necessarily like there's so there's like three  different kinds of files they have on every person and they're like this giant room with like sliding  ladders and there's so many of them like that it's like i can just imagine someone going in there and  trying to be like okay see our files and yeah yeah okay yeah just lost yeah exactly and i'm sure 
[01:53:30]  that like they wouldn't be like okay well here's the exact file you're looking for you know but he's  the guy who knows everything your uncle is the guy who of all the scientologists is the one but  he knows more than all of them as far as what's going on and what's hidden or not hidden yeah i mean  he's the leader so do you see it over the uh over the years do you see scientology getting stronger or  do you see it kind of uh pulling back and becoming just some kind of a little niche thing yeah that's  a good question i mean i of course sorry i'll stop saying that but um she's very cute yes 
[01:54:00]  i think that like i think that the public at large like definitely is more aware of scientology than they  were i don't see people like wanting to join now because it has like a bad stigma right yeah  so i think to that degree you know they probably aren't getting a lot of new members you know but  there are the people who are there who you know have grown up there but again you know the more like 
[01:54:30]  i talk about like you know these people you know are cut off they're not allowed to have access to  internet and no email you know um one thing we could listen to when we're there was the radio  actually um but like um you know there's no tv i think that the church feels the need you know or  they're cut off from their families they feel the need to like let people meet with their families and  that sort of thing and maybe you know because of that you know somebody will hear you know about my 
[01:55:00]  book or my website right yeah and like they like they'll be like oh i knew her when i was there  or i they hear you know that oh that kind of happened to me and just not be able to stop like  maybe reading it because it's so similar to their own experience so i hope that you know something  that i've done can like plant a seed somewhere you know or maybe when one of the seorg members has  their like one day off that they like maybe their mom who never sees them has been worried about them 
[01:55:30]  and she like you know mentioned something and i don't know what would you work what kind of work  would you have to do in seorg i mean it was everything from like there's the cooks who make  food for the other seorg members to like you know i when i was there i worked in the section of the  church where we had to find buildings for churches and like get them purchased and then like design them  and then get the renovations executed um you know from other you know there's obviously the auditors 
[01:56:00]  and then the people who run the classrooms that sort of all sounds like busy work it is just keep  everyone busy how did they become uh a religion because that doesn't give you tax-free status which  is a huge financial yeah advantage i'm sure yeah i mean they yeah they were given tax-exempt status by  the irs and i mean there's different like stories on how that happened i mean i obviously wasn't a part of 
[01:56:30]  that right i remember like i think it was 1994 when they were announcing the war is over we're tax  exempt and stuff like that and so i mean i remember that but i mean from what i've yeah what i've heard  is that they brought a lot of lawsuits um against the irs from different scientologists claiming that they  wanted their um donations to be tax-exempt and then eventually the irs was just like okay well we drop all  these lawsuits if we but i mean did they wow was it was it a rumor that they actually out litigated the 
[01:57:00]  irs yeah that is amazing huh yeah wow now is the like you hear about travolta's lawyer all the time  just because he's in the news marty something he's obviously a tremendous attorney like the last thing  you want to do is get a letter from him marty oh yuck wow would i not want to have to deal with him  what did i say oh boy is he a scientologist or do they only use scientologist lawyers or they use lawyers  from outside the organization oh you know i don't know i know that there's some scientologist lawyers  but i don't i don't i don't think they all are but i have no idea i'm just making up answers at this 
[01:57:30]  those high the cruises at the highest level you can be i guess and so is travolta of uh  they've kind of leveled up as high as possible i don't know where they are i mean the ot levels  go up to ot8 and that's the top of the bridge as they call it and but i mean i  yeah what do you get if you're an ot8 yeah i don't know right on the spaceship or there's some 
[01:58:00]  other there's some other thing about that like another theory like that like but i don't know  exactly what it is i don't remember i never got there i bet you no one never got there they do  actually they do yeah then there's a new expansion pack coming out of course spring yeah how do people  know your ot8 do you have something that indicates that or do you just squeeze it in a conversation or how  do they know it's a wink secret handshake yeah you get a medallion yeah no i mean like well actually  to do like to learn about ot8 you have to go to the ship that they have the the free ones they 
[01:58:30]  like actually have like a cruise ship oh the free ones and that's the only place where you can learn  about that can you do the macarena on the cruise ship is it is it fun or is it all like a drag i think  it's like both like i was i went there once when i was little but i mean we were just taking a tour  we learned how to tie knots how long are you on the uh ship for when you're becoming from ot7 ot8 
[01:59:00]  is it like a one week course or is it six months i don't know because i never did it i mean i know that  my grandma was ot8 and um but yeah on ot7 you have to do that that one in florida in clearwater  so yeah and i think that's like the longest one that's actually yeah yeah well and ot7 you actually  like audit yourself like you hold your own cans and you like operate wow sounds like a great website  description and do you write everything down and you like actually like ask yourself questions and 
[01:59:30]  like answer them to yourself but you like do it in your head like you don't yeah wait so you just  basically there's a video of you holding cans and they go congratulations you made how do you screw  that up congratulations you made it you dropped the cans a bunch of times yeah yeah i got every answer  right yeah how does that how do you not how do you start that and then and then screw it up i mean 
[02:00:00]  you get like even though you're auditing yourself you get like you have to do the six month check which  is the confessional you get that from someone else um and so you have like when you're there i mean you  believe that you know if you're dishonest you cannot make progress you'll never you know get to where  you're going it will be you know it will hold you back and so you are like really forthcoming when  you're there what is uh every religion obviously is based on some kind of afterlife what is their 
[02:00:30]  take on what happens to you uh after your demise are you asking me or john um jim okay  um well they believe that in saintology um you know well they don't have a god and they don't worship  anything but they believe that you're a spiritual being who called they call thetans and then you  basically you live lifetime after lifetime so when your body dies you pick up another body so it's  kind of a reincarnation thing yeah but is it is it all earthly or can you be reincarnated on some far 
[02:01:00]  away land really yeah like the shire i want to go to the shire hobbit and they said that you drop your  body because maybe i've only got through a little bit of books we got it last night but it said uh  l r h drops his body or whatever is that what they call it you should yes that's exactly what  they call it they don't say you're dying oh no really my body's dropping in april y'all could  someone take tom cruise's body after he dropped yeah exactly what if that that'd be very popular  one to go after yeah no what about the gay rumors with tom cruise what i don't i don't know about 
[02:01:30]  that yeah exactly that's what i would say say she's still scared no i honestly don't know  it's called being smart they are rumors i mean they are just rumors and we interviewed and he  wrote a the quote-unquote tell all about tom cruise right and they didn't go after him but he came to  the conclusion which again it may have been the right conclusion that cruise was not gay that he was  straight and i always wondered like i don't think they were going to go for anybody writing an  unauthorized biography but i was wondering if they were very happy with his conclusion so it kind of 
[02:02:00]  allowed the fact that he wrote an almost almost like hey look at unauthorized biography said this  so why would we go after the guy for that yeah yeah yeah maybe some trickery or you know or maybe  they feel or maybe he's really not like that's gotta be annoying if you're not gay and everybody's asking  it's bugged me a few times i've had a few indiscretions well they're telling us that uh jenna has to go  uh because you have other press but the book is called beyond belief i'm only two chapters in and i'm 
[02:02:30]  literally reading it as i walk to the bathroom it's unbelievably interesting to look into this  world that we hear about yeah yeah and from a genuine insider that's uh very cool yeah thank you  thank you jenna thank you very much okay thank you oh no we're gonna do this first black history oh  this year to honor black history month the opian anthony show recognizes some of the great african

[02:06:30]  lap getting spanked by the guy yeah and he was that went from our kind of that's right quote gay fun to  that was an all-out gay thing happening okay that's right it was the same way when there are girls in here  we get them to do like weird shit that's sexual yeah like we don't do it because it's a goof we do it  because it's hot right yeah but that's the way that was all out yesterday it was just gay it was  just gay when he got across uh troy's lap you have now you have now officially done gay stuff you know  that right you had gay sex you officially did gay stuff you're at third gay base that that was yeah 
[02:07:00]  today yesterday i was pretty good no it was gay yeah pretty gay it was gay that was gay  troy i don't know troy will go whatever and i understand that he's like whatever i'm down  for whatever troy's just a sexual dude he's whatever yeah was that officially a gay scene  yesterday i don't know i'm just following your guys leave no i'm not i understand you'll do just  about anything but that but you gotta admit that was like a gay scene it got weird yesterday did it

[02:08:00]  i'd love to do anything we have we can put our heads together and think of fun stuff to do with  girls how about it's about time we do i heard sam talking about this uh on the after show yesterday  and uh you missed a huge point about the why the gay stuff goes on in here and then we don't have  the hetero stuff with the chicks because we've had girls in here and and we're like hey could you  take your top off well you gotta see the magazine to get that or uh how about you take your pants off so  we can see your place well if you show me first it's always something guys are willing to just 
[02:08:30]  take their shit off and start being gay all right but yeah i could find sluts to come in here and do  crazy shit well let's go we're heading we're heading into a bad direction definitely going into the  gay zone in the words of dade uh dave douglas we're officially going in going in we're all in we're all  in the gay zone but this is your guys direction this is what you guys want direction it is true it  just went that's i just you guys asked me to spank him that's what i did it got a little weird 
[02:09:00]  man it got really weird but i'm all in dude i don't give a shit i'll do anything i think we need  to pull back well i think a little bit sometimes when when the ship is being righted it does feel  odd for everybody involved i'm not going to say uh of course jimmy made it really funny but i mean  the fact is it was it was a gay scene how's your ass today sal oh that's good you pretty much got  pound it he's good how could your ass was torn up his bottom was reddened he had a good a good  reddening his bottom fine are you feeling right out as you sit down still no no no he didn't spank 
[02:09:30]  you hard enough when you when you had your your underwear pulled down and you you were you were  wearing nothing else but those underwear yeah and you got across troy's lap all right sort of bent one  leg that's when it hit me i looked at that scene and went that is exactly what you see if you put gay  sex in google with all the filters shut off that's what would come up it certainly is anthony yes  and it was fun to watch you guys both cringe because you don't see that too often it was 
[02:10:00]  something wasn't right about that old thing there look that was the thing that's what you guys did  and then i thought about getting down to my underwear again but then i was like that's  going to be just is it on a gay site that would have been very good it would have been very appropriate  what is that on spankthisgay.com oh my god that's what you guys did that's what you guys did you're  officially part of spankthisgay.com sure but i mean it's like you know obviously things had gone  awry and what we needed to bring us right back and get us on the straight and narrow was not always uh  it's always pleasant we take your medicine but i told them we were talking about on the after show 
[02:10:30]  yesterday when kenny did it it wasn't weird or uncomfortable it was funny when did see i don't  xm what was the circumstances there i don't remember but he got in trouble and someone spanked  he took a bare-bottom spank oh god did he pull his pants down oh yeah yeah oh been there huh and  you've been there huh and yeah yeah that's where i've been gay sex you're an idiot road hog but like  this road hog didn't have any of that fun or funniness to it well unfortunately sal took a 
[02:11:00]  beating for the the anger of the staff that was sort of discussed yesterday so oh it's kind of how well  it was just it was a tense day so it was like tickled his balls like that guy's doing yeah  well you're a halfway motherfucker this is the next big prank oh wow i guess we gotta uh spanked what  is it called again he looks like a gay wait go down the bottom there he looks like a young greg opie  hughes oh great look that's probably from my fraternity that's a pledge fucking jesus amazing hey guys you 
[02:11:30]  want to pick which one you want to do next there's a lot of different ways you can go that's quite  one do you want to go with pulling uh the underpants off the individual quite let's see which one you  want i may say oh obviously no insertion so all right we got to x out the insertion ones yesterday  was the first time i'm sure we could pull someone's underpants off aggressively yesterday was the first  time i thought i didn't really even want to do the gay off anymore i don't know so really that was 
[02:12:00]  it yeah yeah yeah yeah tapped into something i understand what you're saying no that's not what  i'm saying the date off will be the end of this cycle it has to be it has to be it's the pinnacle  what's going on guys wow look at that look at that what's what's look at that one gentleman  straightening out another gentleman what's wrong you could all you've seen videos of people helping  each other i don't know was uh did fezzy get uh upset about us uh doing that because it kind of 
[02:12:30]  looked like you know we were kind of laughing and ew and i don't know if he did he get pissed  probably too gay for him even i don't know if he said anything on the air i know he made reference  to it when we were passing each other before the show what did he say what did he say oh uh gay  spanking show interesting oh okay but he thought it was funny i don't know i don't know maybe you  know i like really thought it was interesting yeah you know what looking at some of those sites  i don't even think fez could i don't think he's up for anything like that there's a man 
[02:13:00]  has tongue buried another man's asshole right there in front of me on this uh monitor you think he'd be  like a deer in headlights that's a boy that's a commitment right there you could come out and say  you're gay that's fine and dandy there's degrees to which one can be involved in gay sex like what  well it's like you know heterosexual porn sites you don't have to do every single sex act that's on  them no but you're using your your tongue and various orifices yeah you know so that's part of 
[02:13:30]  the gay sex you gotta put your mouth somewhere i bet feds could put a finger in somebody that's  fucking baby shit well that's nothing compared to fucking you gotta get your mouth involved even with  gay sex let him grow into it you know what i mean no i don't know what you mean you gotta  fucking gay guys ain't gonna stand for some newbie experimenting with digits right be like what the  fuck is this about i'm not here to train a gay guy you start sticking your tongue in my ass put that  tongue in my bunghole exactly what are we doing today i don't know oh set up the table what are the

[02:15:00]  he's trying to get back on opie's good side he's agreeing to every gay thing opie you understand that sal  is agreeing to all these gay acts because he thinks it'll get on your good side that's right you're not  gonna get on my good side ever you gotta give him an e for effort that's right that's what was it 08  that's some 08 shit yeah what's the highest level um 08 08 yeah yeah yeah we get to 8 so sorry ouch 
[02:15:30]  even if he's smooth and hairless we could small talk about the knicks that's as is it gonna get  sal did you see a bailey jay when uh bailey jay was in here yes i did would you suck bailey jay's  cock i don't believe that i don't believe that i don't in a second either sal just admitted he's  selfish maybe he doesn't like the titties turns them off a little bit maybe off i guess maybe  need a flat chest with your cock would you let bailey jay suck your cock no oh yes you 
[02:16:00]  bullshit would you would you be able to come no definitely wouldn't be able to  you can't even come with a fucking real girl yeah troy doesn't believe not a word of this  you know troy huh yeah so i think and this was discussed a little bit yesterday on the after  shows sal's in denial of some of his um i think some of his true inner feelings yeah  you're going to um therapist or something like that i heard tell yeah i might start going  i might start why yeah i don't know just a confusion going on in your life no not 
[02:16:30]  not for sexual reasons just you know why just for uh what it sounds like you had a good upbringing  what's going on with you why are you going to a therapist why the why the pain and agony i don't  have pain and agony it's just i think it's a it's a healthy thing to do why do you think you need to  do it though yeah i think everybody should you should be to be more self-aware you know and go ahead  make the gay joke but it's just i don't know why are you going to a therapist i think it'd be a good  idea too like i had some mom issues i went to a therapist what is the reason you're going there 
[02:17:00]  anger issues you need you need something confusion you don't just go yeah let me go to a therapist  right he wants a therapist to drag him kicking and screaming out of the closet exactly you hear voices  in your head what is it what's the thing that is at least making you go hello do you go see a  therapist do the party you feel empty and then you realize it's your asshole why are you going to a  a therapist that's an easy question i don't know i'm just young and going through uh young dumb and  full of cum yes in his ass completely right yeah exactly i'll get it out going through what so yeah 
[02:17:30]  i don't know i just i just think it'd be healthy for me you're a little weird though learn about  myself why can't you answer that question i had a crisis but it's just uh yeah young man coming of age  is it something you don't want to is it something you don't want to discuss with us  no not are you not as into girls you're not as into girls as you think you should no it has nothing to  do with my sexuality i've made that very clear what does it have to do with i don't know i just  you know i think it's it it'd be cathartic for me in a way i'd learn something no one goes to therapy 
[02:18:00]  without saying wow i'm having a hard time dealing with this or i wonder why i do this right let me  there's got to be something wrong there's always a general reason maybe you get into some other  shit after you get there yeah yeah certainly that was the case with me but what what is the general  reason you're going right what's your catalyst that's kind of made you go i want to get catalyst  yeah um i don't know i really don't know what made you think it was a good idea three cows one  ball put that in your head i think it's a healthy idea for for any person in in this day and age  that's all oh my god i think what happened to how annoying is he i think he's worse than iraq you're 
[02:18:30]  with the vagary he might not know he might just be very discontent right now and not happy with  things in general and he's not sure why uh we all know why but i think that he's trying to go  and have and figure it out because he's hoping it'll be anything but that yeah but it isn't no  it's that hoping the therapist will pull out some other magical reason like why do i feel almost  like a woman trapped in a man's body yeah and hoping the therapist will find another solution 
[02:19:00]  well you're not doing enough kettlebells ah that must be it but the therapist will come to the  therapist will go um all right sal your name let's uh see this uh okay take a seat sally  sal you're gay they'll be like right after hello my name is doctor whatever you're gay  i think you're gay dude no it's cool though oh my god it's fine there's nothing wrong with it wow  we'd all be so excited to hear that my feelings for sal wouldn't change one bit gay guy on the staff 
[02:19:30]  how fucking awesome would it be if there was a gay producer other than travis yeah yeah someone  that admits it right yeah doesn't doesn't ruin a woman's life by pretending to right enjoy her genitals  poor child oh my god exactly oh poor riley i have two mommies  i have two oh alana and her hot wax so what are we doing today man well sal uh you're gonna
