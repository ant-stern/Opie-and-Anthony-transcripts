<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie's quest for a pet for his son, sparking a discussion about various animals, ranging from rabbits and turtles to dogs and fish.  This conversation frequently devolved into misogynistic and homophobic slurs.  Opie also recounted a negative street encounter with a former radio colleague.  A significant portion focused on their Call of Duty: Black Ops II experiences, including a humorous anecdote about hearing a child ask for a grilled cheese sandwich during an online match. A caller, Corey, initially intending to discuss racism in the game, ended up detailing his negative experiences with management at his Hudson News job in Las Vegas Airport, prompting debate on whether his topic was misrepresented by pre-screening.  The hosts then previewed upcoming guests: Oliver Stone, Chris Tucker, and Penn Jillette, while mocking a scathing restaurant review, specifically targeting Guy Fieri’s establishment.

The show continued with further criticism of the overly negative restaurant review, contrasting the reviewer’s high-brow approach with their own fondness for TGI Fridays. The conversation then shifted to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, mocking its narrative of surviving Hurricane Sandy, followed by darkly comedic musings about its fate and contrasting it with the presidential turkey pardon.  A substantial portion was dedicated to analyzing various earworm songs, especially a LIPA (Long Island Power Authority) power outage parody song, dissecting its production and the creator's apparent business model.  The segment concluded with a jarring shift to a video showing Annette Funicello's severely deteriorated condition due to multiple sclerosis, eliciting shock and disgust from the hosts and crew, punctuated by a brief, humorous calculation of a woman's breast size using water displacement. The E-Rock jingle contest, featuring entries from Zeps, George Huckus, Thomas Hamilton, Sean F., Ron Roof, Matt Lewis, and Josh Howell,  was revisited, highlighting their vulgar and offensive insults targeting E-Rock's weight.  The judging, involving E-Rock, other staff, and secret ballots, ended with a pending tie-breaker for third place and a promise to reveal the winner later.


Penn Jillette joined the show, discussing his views on mediums and psychics, detailing the techniques they use (cold and hot readings, ambiguity, etc.) and the legal implications of labeling them frauds. He shared anecdotes from his career, including a surprisingly successful seance. Chris Tucker, present for a brief 10 minutes, shared a personal experience with a psychic who refused to read him due to sensing he wouldn't pay, agreeing with Penn’s skepticism.  The show then explored the personalities and potential psychological issues of comedians, speculating on insecurity and the need for validation.  Penn discussed his aversion to watching his own work, his creative process, his atheism, and his book "Every Day is an Atheist Holiday," sharing anecdotes about Piers Morgan and his views on religion, philanthropy, and the impact of 9/11.  He detailed his approach to raising his children without religion and engaged in a debate on atheism versus religion. Humorous moments included a discussion on engagement rings and an unexpected encounter with Susan Boyle outside the studio.  The "FU Line" segment also featured angry listener messages. The show concluded with a mysterious gift—a sweet potato pecan pie—sent by "Dr. Steve."


The next segment previewed the upcoming Oliver Stone interview, again featuring off-color banter involving the pie and Nettie Funnicello.  The conversation shifted to Stone's "Untold History of the United States," prompting speculation on potential interview questions and a digression into the use of the n-word and the morality of judging historical events by contemporary standards, leading to a debate on slavery, conquest, and the Constitution's morality.  "Who Kid" joined, contributing to crude and sexually explicit jokes, including recounting his experience DJing for Muammar Gaddafi and details about his payment ($15,280 for one hour).  Finally, Oliver Stone arrived.  The interview covered his perspective on American history, challenging traditional narratives, highlighting the Soviet Union's role in WWII, and questioning America's self-perception. It touched upon the Cold War, ideology, and contextualizing historical events.

The final segment featured Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick, discussing their book and documentary, emphasizing its alternative perspective on American history. Opie’s joking revelation of his belief in the Oswald theory regarding JFK's assassination led to a playful moment where Stone almost choked him.  The interview ended prematurely due to time constraints.

[00:10:00]  nope nope nope nope nope nope nope slow and steady wins the race  and then uh we were looking at chant chantillas can't what are the chinchillas chinchillas right  that's a little piece of a coat yeah yeah yeah but the the guy's like you can't get their fur wet  if you get their fur wet what they reproduce it ruins their fur and don't fear them after midnight  ruins their fur they have to take dust baths dust bath what's a dust bath that's when they go in 
[00:10:30]  the dust and just go yeah but they have a thing made where they go inside it so that that  how do you do that doesn't go flying all over your apartment it stays contained birds do that they  go into little things that's sand and dirt and go with their wings stupid little dust bath  don't get a rabbit it pisses in the cage now you'll hear how great rabbits are to have and then someone 
[00:11:00]  will say no let me tell you why that collar was full of shit rabbits rule rabbits are fine my brother  has a rabbit that kind of just hops around his house they let it out and then they it gets lost  and they take a couple days to find it but then there's that shit all over the house you know  little pellets can you train a rabbit though looks like you suck the candy coating off a good and  plenty like little what are those little ones raisin that's little raisin that's delicious that'd be  nice so then i asked the pet store guy i'm like what kind of pet do you get a two and a half year 
[00:11:30]  old he goes what kind of pet do you like because you're going to be taking care of this thing that's  true looks like the guy doesn't really like uh working at uh the pet store anymore he's had it what a  bitter jaded cynical man he's recommending terrible things what is that's a hornet's nest i can't bring my  shit that's right yeah you just have him smack out the bees fly around and they sing to him  i i'm not getting a dog anytime soon because that is a major responsibility cats you can leave in  your house i need a pet that i could still go down in like the caribbean and know that the pet is just 
[00:12:00]  doing whatever the fuck it wants in my apartment it's fine but dogs you cannot do that with but they  can walk them in your building do they have dog walkers and stuff in the buildings we live in  you probably wouldn't even yeah but a cat you could just say fuck it you could here's your  stupid litter box and i'll see you in a week but they won't even notice a little i just want to go  over your house and play with it like a little dog with no like what are the hypoallergenic ones  that'd be nice i'll be so cute adorable yeah yeah so i gotta figure this out where do i just go get 
[00:12:30]  fish fish are a pet cop out dude yeah is it really yeah because you don't have any interaction with  them yeah but he could like sprinkle the food in oh great we could stare at it they live in a  whole nother world they live in a whole nother fucking world and a little square portion of  their fucking universe that is hilarious actually why do you want to name a star yeah exactly is that  the dumbest thing ever you know when we're long gone they're going to take all those records and 
[00:13:00]  shred them and go no no we haven't named any stars how many stars do you think are double named  of course makeup certificates yeah yours there's a file somewhere that they'll they'll shred  eventually and go no we're not going to just name a star after some dummy that was on this planet for  a few years the star registry that's not happening do not get a rabbit they chew every electrical wire  in the house it will destroy your house if you get one of the really cute ones like the king rex  because they only live five years oh boy oh if you get one okay what's a king rex you can't get a pet 
[00:13:30]  and then then you have to deal with the pet dying which sucks right it's not like it's a good thing  if the pet dies soon i'm really suspicious of that by the way especially after coming out of an up  tempo number great how do you know your your your pet isn't old when you're buying it because pets  don't age like humans i'm looking at all these birds i'm like they could be a month old or 10 years  old i don't know yeah and what if you fall in love with one of the dumb birds you bring it home it dies  within a week because it was already its old age yeah how do you figure that shit out i don't know 
[00:14:00]  you cut them in half and count their rings i got questions that's a treat but think about it yeah  we all probably got you know fucked over by bringing a pet home we thought was young and it wasn't  why would the pet store tell you that it's uh it's on its last leg not in their best interest  you know the snakes and shit like that you know they're old because they keep growing or whatever  but a bird dogs get them whiskers yeah dogs you know but i'm talking like birds gerbils how old 
[00:14:30]  are the fucking gerbils an old gerbil look like how old are they all caked with shit rats are the  best pets no joke oh right get a ferret ferrets they stink my friend you could have them decent  no no no no they stink as animals oh i thought you meant literally oh yeah they do literally but i mean  they just stink yeah my friend had a ferret i'm like what the fuck do you do with it it it it has  no nothing going on slinky that's what that fucking thing is you want you want a pet that's going to 
[00:15:00]  acknowledge you if you're feeding it yeah yeah that's it like oh oh here comes my food oh thank you  ferrets aren't like expressions get a lizard yeah oh wow you know they really do care for you do they  they care about you sure i had uh cats growing up which would turn my mom blue so we'd always fall  in love with a cat and we'd have to get rid of it because she was extremely allergic she'd be outside  completely blue as the paramedics are wondering what the fuck's wrong with her and turned out it was 
[00:15:30]  the cats oh had dogs a lot of collies and fish that's it that's all we've ever had yeah what'd you  have i had cats i had dogs what was your dog of choice uh my my pops uh liked uh what they call  the german shepherd of course yeah he liked the german shepherd i think he i think uh portion of his  life he liked what he saw on television i think he did good work jesus christ that's the i've said on

[00:16:30]  them have a black mole what's that about yeah they do what is that i don't know they got a little  thing on their face a little fucking that just adds to everything yeah a little cindy crawford dog  you want to learn about russian tortoises real fast because i'm telling you i'm i'm hearing a lot of  good things about this yes look i only eat vegetable madly look at me with a with magnetic shell  what about a guinea pig oh hey come on i might take offense to that jesus patrick what do you got 
[00:17:00]  on the russian tortoise real fast not italian i've had uh six russian tortoises yeah i've had them i've  had two of them for about uh 12 years yeah they uh they're nice and easy to take care of you want  to go away uh just throw a head of lettuce in there and go away well how cool are they though do they  acknowledge you as a human being that they're not as cool as human being no well are they as cool as  human beings because i would ask that after of course doing radio since i was 18 fucking had it 
[00:17:30]  how do these asses do they acknowledge you as human beings do they actually interact with you and  show affection not just you being the thing that brings them food as much as a reptile does it i mean  reptile little dinosaurs walking around in there in the way they eat and stuff that's good but do  they make the earth flat so so they do make the earth flat so they're a shitty pet really yeah that  sounds shitty it depends on what type of pet you want if you want an easy pet they're an easy pet i 
[00:18:00]  if i'm going to clean up their shit i want them to acknowledge me in some fucking way that's it  that's my only rule yeah well some kind of awareness like oh you again but look it's adorable  that's cute right there it's a little guinea pig the more they interact with you the more you  interact with them the more they'll do with you if you don't touch them for a while yeah and how old  uh what's their lifespan oh like 90 years you can't buy a pet that's gonna be around 90 fucking

[00:19:30]  the cat got out of line the kid deferred him there you go i've never touched a hairless cat  that's why you show yourself up to new experiences it's the only kind i like  enough of me and my stupid pets i gotta figure it out i see a small hypoallergenic dog i saw one  recently they are very cute i see them in the elevator once in a while they are pretty i like  to kiss other people's dogs but the problem with that in manhattan you have to you have to interact  with other dog owners when you live in the suburbs you don't have to deal with this but when you're 
[00:20:00]  walking down the sidewalk and you see another dog owner you have to stop it's protocol and allow uh  your dogs to sniff each other and fucking hump each other for like 10 or 15 seconds and if you  have the tiny small little dog you look like an idiot letting everyone hump your tiny little cute dog  yeah in the city it's all about the fucking also the in the elevator like i even know from my  building you go in the elevator and there's somebody bringing their dog up and and they're  constantly okay down oh yeah and the dog's like

[00:24:30]  hunch over and you put your hand out and and you rub your thumb middle and point your finger together  and go hey bunny bunny and thing fucking takes off like a shot it's always suspicious yes  never trusting oh i love it scaredy bunny annoys me it's like having a deer in your living room  tell you how to touch it just fucking look it's suspicious and bolts but at least heads at least 
[00:25:00]  deer have a reason yeah they're delicious granted hunters will shoot a rabbit every once in a while but  deer is holy fuck their whole existence is hiding from hunters oh man especially this time of year  right yeah things they don't see this fucking screaming piece of lead coming at their fucking  yeah body uh jimmy that's really funny really funny well enough about me and my kid and pets uh  good luck with that how was uh black ops oh man it's fucking so you're tweeting a little bit oh my god 
[00:25:30]  my eyes are still fucking spinning in my head really i was playing that how many hours  fantastic i don't know a few that's for sure a few hours playing with the controller getting a  little better at it a little better yeah xbox it's um it's pretty cool they got a few uh new features  on there a little a few new things with the uh gameplay and um they got that uh drone that goes  around a few new um uh a few new uh things where if you get enough points during the game you can um 
[00:26:00]  call in airstrikes and stuff like that but i'm still just getting knifed all the time and  no matter what direction i'm facing someone's always behind me it always seems like someone's  behind me and then when i i turn to look behind me for that split second to see if somebody's coming  and then i turn back someone's right in front of me shooting me what the fuck what happened my  timing stinks you're like you're like a skittish buddy with i really am but so you're already 
[00:26:30]  online oh yeah i was online like easy immediately uh when i got the game i don't really like playing  the campaign version the uh you know the the actual one person game version isn't it kind of cool  though it is but i i'd rather i'd rather just play fucking multiplayer you don't want to go through  it just once no i kind of like just getting online and playing with a bunch of people have a  lot of people giving up on that and they just no other people play it a lot of people play the actual  game but you know there's a fuckload of people playing this so you get a lot of people playing 
[00:27:00]  the game you get a lot of people doing multiplayer you get people that play the game and then go to  multiplayer it uh it's cool though it's there's nothing drastically different than the previous  versions but it's cool to see new new maps and new uh little features that little drone  thing that comes in so shooting your part is pretty cool but it could easily be taken out  uh with a machine gun it's it's kind of weak that thing's kind of weak really yeah how are the 
[00:27:30]  graphics uh i'm way behind for xbox uh they look pretty good but i mean pc games always look better  than of course but did you notice uh an upgrade in the graphics between the last version and this  version no not really really no not really but the graphics are great i i mean i i like them the  the the death uh scenes are pretty good you know you get a lot of variations on how the the  people drop dead um you know you shoot them in the legs they'll they'll collapse from the legs uh 
[00:28:00]  they'll spin around if you hit them on one side sometimes they they fall quickly sometimes they just  go down to their knees and then flop on their face it's kind of you know i like that immersive  part of the game do you feel bad when they die never didn't you with one game um was it half  life or something i'm trying to remember you you told a story once where it's getting so like yeah  yeah they were realistic that yeah you got creeped out a little bit yeah when when you're sniping  sometimes you'll shoot somebody and just see that red fucking pink mist right and then the people 
[00:28:30]  just kind of uh their head will roll back and they'll just fall down on their face i love it pretty  cool how's the commissary uh the comments just do the boring stuff in the game yeah  it's uh yeah i i like it i give it uh two thumbs up as they say and and roland went out of five um  two thumbs up as far as stars go i would give it uh 4.5 stars damn the only reason i don't give it five 
[00:29:00]  is that it really does just kind of take up where left last game left off no real new surprises or  anything right um roland bought me a copy yesterday because i was pitching that the game company  actually didn't send me my copy but then he emailed me and said the game company sent you the copy but  it's the hardened version like extras so i brought back this shitty version which will now go to roland  and i will get the good version ha ha ha ha i am the talent that's not cool i need to play 
[00:29:30]  the bestest zest version it's not a cool thing to do why it is cool because he's rolling went out  of his way to get the game so then anthony should be like oh you can keep the nice one yeah no i  should have got that's not going to happen you should have got the nicer version yeah i should  have gotten it yesterday god damn it yeah and then i was playing online and uh just a little reminder  of the second you you start thinking um there's anything cool about this uh people have their headsets

[00:39:00]  going yes boo you know it's supposed to be fun and that's just creepy yeah while there's ghoulish  music playing yes he's just why don't you fucking put an icon of a coffin up let us talk to that  fucking creep we know he's dead yes our friend we're trying to like maybe make a little keeping  his memory alive yeah he's a character i'm gonna block my first person ever on twitter wow  he's just started on something it says calm down opie too early to smash callers give some slack  in first hour i'm not that wasn't the point the point was that sal fucked up right idiot 
[00:39:30]  how about you wake the fuck up and you made something out of that caller i mean and i said  it perfectly why would i take that why would we take that call yeah but if it's racism in the new  call of duty game you want to see what the fuck that's about but then it turns out that he wasn't  going to talk about any of that but sal decided that's what he he thought he wanted to sal's  credit i mean fair is fair sal didn't know what he was going to talk about no you didn't understand  him but he's just like yeah throwing racism that ought to work that ought to fly and when you get 
[00:40:00]  on could you say love you love the show what those idiots oh sal comment uh sal no sal do you just  panic i misinterpreted the call oh boy what did you like you thought he said race but what did he  really say i wasn't sure so why would you put that through yeah he said he said he said there is  there's a lot of racism in call of duty so i said can i put that up and he said yeah we don't need 
[00:40:30]  callers that bad i i i hate doing the phones it's the most miserable job there is oh  i'll tell you all the stupid jobs i had i don't i don't shame how long you've been here that's right  you should be on air oh yeah i have i want to be an on-air guy at your age i had to deliver pizza  for a midday guy you know how stupid that is a midday guy you know what a midday guy does with his  radio show he means nothing to a radio station guess who was lower than the midday guy me i had to 
[00:41:00]  deliver his stupid pizza every fucking day yeah i don't want the workforce block or whatever the  fuck it was called sounds like a great bit yeah the guy would play three or four songs for an  office and guess what they also got pizza and guess who had to deliver the fucking pizza every  day i had to be a pizza delivery man when i wanted to be on the radio i love pizza who doesn't i would  i would have killed i would have killed to answer phones for a morning show at your age would you  pull calls up if you didn't know what they were talking about no i would have been like holy  fuck i i can't blow this oh what instead i hate it a horrible job wow you're you stink i want pizza

[00:42:30]  i would love some pizzas all i'm thinking is how good a hot slice of pizza isn't it great  fucking hot would you like a little garlic not too much yeah it's a little bit yeah  the early days of me getting into radio i was a pizza delivery man how good does it smell when you  bring it over oh it was good i couldn't have any and i was i was fucking give you i was dirt poor  they didn't give you any of it hell no did you half-ass it what did you half-ass it  no i worked hard would you let the cheese spill no why because back then there was five guys waiting 
[00:43:00]  to be the pizza delivery guy well technically for the radio station i mean there are a lot of people  who kind of want sal's job but they're just all where are they let's give a shot they're all our  old i'm ready you know how many texts and tweets and stuff me and eric get from old interns and stuff  going what the fuck every time sal gets brought up on the air useless people no disrespect to sal but  david was a great i wish david had found a place here too he's one guy i wish oh my god he's the  guy who you know pat duffy paul pat was great pat's crazy though and i said that with love pat's 
[00:43:30]  insane of course that's what i love about he's very funny and he's extremely entertaining but pat  is truly i've seen him outside i've seen him outside this place he's a he's uh a maniac remember  the time he almost got into a fight because of a uh because he dropped a plastic bottle on the ground  when was this he talked about this he told a story on the air one time yeah but he's different he's  living way in the boonies where he knows he can't hurt too many people exactly he lives really  far away really really tiny town now i don't know if prep from people yeah because he knows he can't 
[00:44:00]  interact with too many people so if i'm in a small town that that cuts down interactions  i won't kill someone today that's great so he's self-aware good for him i can't believe there wasn't  one like lame duck job that we could get into intern david right it might still be but he runs  away we can't even say hi to him he's the bunny rabbit of interns right he just runs away we'll  get him scared shaking we won't get him no what happens when you see dave he stares at you right 
[00:44:30]  and then you go david oh well and then you see you see curly cues of smoke and where he used to be you  here and then you see a spinning yarmulke just fall on the floor yeah i was i'm trying to remember  which comedian it was either brewer patrice o'neill we were having a little little uh late  breakfast after the show a block from here it's one of those open restaurants where you can sit  inside but you're kind of on the sidewalk uh-huh and i go wait that guy that's david and he's in 
[00:45:00]  this nice suit with a tie and all i said was hey dave huh i i didn't even get high out  he ran away yeah what is that about and he's right but he does it to everybody yeah well he's scared of  the show he thinks that uh i think his parents have convinced him they finally got to him that the  show was not good for his career what career does he have now what career he works at the uh uh  uh what's it called the trade center the 9-11 memorial oh is he there i thought he's at the 
[00:45:30]  intrepid no he moved there and he helps uh families find where their loved ones names are oh my god  that's gotta be horrendous it's a less depressing job than he had here  madgy is that who you'd want to help find the family name yeah well let me see oh what happened  where's the name bubba what happened to the name bubba where is it like no my my late husband his name is  here hmm no no no no no his name's not here no no no you're gonna stay again you think his family 
[00:46:00]  got him deprogrammed yeah i mean some kind of jewish deprogramming program they were really working  on him even when he was an intern i mean his is he used to get in so much trouble for coming home  smelling like dog shit because he sprayed liquid or or like uh a massage therapist yeah i mean he was  d.l hugley got him a fucking hand job right oh yeah and i think i think his mom might have found  out somehow that he had gotten a hand job oh but i hugley gave him the money i had never seen a person 
[00:46:30]  so happy as the day he went and got his d.l hugley paid for did you go with him yeah i mean obviously  i didn't go inside with him but i waited outside and took the cab back with him and everything he was  you just went to some shitty massage parlor the closest one muscle that's hilarious and what happened  i we haven't told the story in a while so well he went in but what what what what was going on as  you guys were going there was he out of his mind happy and just he was very nervous when we were 
[00:47:00]  going there and he did the fuck he he because we made him pay for the cab because d.l hugley gave him  a whole bunch of money yeah so he paid for the cab and uh the tip that he gave the cab driver it was  like uh you know the cab ride was probably like 7 56 or something and he gave him eight dollars and  said keep the change he wasn't joking like he's like yeah i keep the change keep the change well  you know why yeah it makes perfect sense actually it's actually pretty generous if you know what i 
[00:47:30]  mean that's for sure it's been my experience yeah well i never met a plane in life he was  all wound up tight and he had his jacket all zipped up and everything and we were telling him just to  relax and go in and just do what they tell him and blah blah blah and he went in how bad would you  want to hear audio of the how it went down please because you know he just said stupid  shit oh wow look at me i'm coming i bet he got quiet as he was getting jerked it was probably like 
[00:48:00]  oh like he doesn't want to make any guttural moans and really get into it you just hear your hand going  when he walked out he was like skipping down the street he was holding his jacket he wasn't even  wearing it he'd never been looser man and he was also convinced that the masseuse liked him well  oh which was sweet wow that's nice that's like he probably didn't tip her though yeah 
[00:48:30]  he probably didn't tip her she probably jerked him he probably gave her nothing extra though  as part of the deal she hates him to this day i'm sure she knew going in that she wasn't getting  a tip somewhere we have like a i gotta find it we have a 45 minute post massage interview with him  that never we we had clips we never aired the entire thing but it might be my favorite interview  i've ever done because it was immediately after it happened is it worth playing yeah i'm gonna find  it and play it maybe i'll play it maybe get us clips for tomorrow we got a busy day today better

[00:58:30]  review could you highlight the best parts of it and we'll uh we'll do some of it after the break i  think i'd be willing to do that you feel bad about uh the review being bad sam i had guy fieri on the  after show yesterday you did yeah was he here and everything out yeah he was here he was only  for like 10 minutes he did a little sal bashing with me so it was fine you know what why is he  in town to save his restaurant um for help sandy's victims yeah he was doing like a 50 of the bill 
[00:59:00]  goes to sandy victims but you know i think it's up to the new york times to review restaurants  appropriately true there's someone's got it out for man because wow it's brutal i think you're right  some of the chefs said they have one reviewer who reviews desserts but yet the guy's diabetic  no really yeah they all talk they all talk shit about different reviewers i want the cheesecake  i saw ratatouille those fucking reviewers could be brutal  ratatouille i want to go to guys right now was that a documentary oh god a movie i've seen a hundred 
[00:59:30]  times i've never seen that ratatouille's really good i mean pat oswald's in it he's the rat and it's  it's it's a great little animated uh film but it's he cooks but i've seen it way too many times  at this point and the reviewer in that movie was brutal man brutal yeah i want to go to a guy's  restaurant now to support him i like a break that they shouldn't have the power to make a break a  place you know because they could have ulterior motives it's like yelp we should have a show outing 
[01:00:00]  at guy fear that's what i was thinking actually we should and go there and give it a fair shot  you have to go there today after your big interview i mean what if it's a guy that just  likes traditional restaurants and traditional chefs and then he comes across guy fieri who's just you  know rocking out there and a wild on the edge exactly you know rock and roll fucking you know crazy  are you saying he's like rock and roll johnny dude dude do you ever see him anymore no i i see his 
[01:00:30]  tweets and fucking rock and roll rock and roll rock and roll a lot of people can't hang with  i used to know this guy and uh he every time you saw him i know he was married to my sister  i know it's just yeah i didn't know how much rock and roll i just want to talk about for a second  that's like it's a hello that's like it's hello and goodbye and how you doing it's like  rock and roll hey johnny how you doing rock and roll what's going on tonight rock and roll she must  have fucking hated his stupid ocd asperger's rock and roll wherever we saw him oh man hey we know 
[01:01:00]  you you don't have to give us the rock and roll yep just say hi rock and roll i loved it though  there's something about it a lot of reviewers can't hang with the type of rock and roll chef who will  wear his sunglasses on the back of his head you know what that's right you don't go into a  fucking restaurant and see that no you don't go into a restaurant and see some guy wearing the chef  hat with flames on it that's exactly that's crazy right there so why don't we try to cutting edge why  don't we try to get guy in the show to defend himself with this uh review because this thing is going 
[01:01:30]  everywhere yeah it is that would be good for us and him maybe yeah and he's the type of guy that  would probably uh talk about it send me an email yeah send me an email see if you're not afraid to  step up no take on tell him opie and anthony are are here for you and uh we want to give you your  voice today about maybe he'll take that reviewer and pour some fucking booze down his throat without  telling or hot grease throw hot grease do we have these printed out yet the review yeah okay thank you  it's just not highlighted because i was his first regular customer there yeah jesus this is long 
[01:02:00]  that's what i'm saying this guy has detailed it proves that this guy has uh has it out for guy fieri  no restaurant review is this long i don't think i've never seen one this long is it um you know  are there any of their concerns well why don't you read a little bit of it jimmy because we don't  see what some of this is this guy's obviously a jerk off i think immediately guy fieri have you 
[01:02:30]  eaten at your new restaurant in times square have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at guy's american  kitchen and bar and ordered a meal did you eat the food did it live up to your expectations oh boy did  panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu where adjectives and nouns  spin in a crazy vortex by the way right there in that is this cocksucker's elitism even if it's not  a good restaurant the fact that guy dials up his restaurant like the tourist place in times square  but this elite is fucking jizz bag at the times yeah he's not doesn't go for that type of stuff 
[01:03:00]  obviously he's not going to explain what type of restaurant is right off the bat that it is uh  right you know yeah it's a times square restaurant it's just very different than putting a restaurant  downtown or something yes when you saw the burger described as guys pat lafayette custom blend  all natural creek stone farm black angus beef patty ltop lettuce tomato onion and pickle smc super  melty cheese and slathering of donkey sauce on garlic butter donkey brioche delicious did your mind touch 
[01:03:30]  the void for a minute what's wrong with that it's like gimmicky menu which is kind of cool it's you know  it's whatever it's like triple d the people watch it diners drivers and dives oh there you go see  yeah there you go but what he's doing is he's showcasing he's using guys with a restaurant to  showcase his snarky writing ability yes even if he's right i still hate this reviewer already  yeah did you notice that the menu was an unreliable prediker uh a predictor sorry an unreliable predictor 
[01:04:00]  of what actually came to the table were the bourbon butter crunch chips with fat missing from your  almond joy cocktail too was your deep fried boulder of ice cream the size of a standard scoop  oh i guess he didn't like the um adjectives what exactly about a small salad with four or five  miniature croutons makes guys famous big bite caesar a big b famous or c guys in any meaningful sense  just ask for the big salad say i want a big salad yeah were you struck by how very far from awesome the 
[01:04:30]  awesome pretzel chicken tenders are wow i think no i bet they're awesome i think they are awesome  it's pretty far from  if you hadn't come up with the recipe yourself would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of  breading that exudes grease onto the plate contained either pretzel or smoked almonds wow  did you discern any buttermilk or brine in the white meat or did you think it tasted like chewy air 
[01:05:00]  wow that sounds good i love chewy air nice it's good i don't even know what that would taste like  no i know han solo always eats it  thanks roland chewy oh jesus oh my god this restaurant was grody  why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret  a lunch only sandwich of chopped soy glazed pork with coleslaw and cukes called a roasted pork 
[01:05:30]  banmai where it resembled that item about as much as you resemble emily dickinson by the way valley  jim added cukes it's cucumbers cucumbers oh my god this is a grody restaurant oh  oh i think this reviewer has um a motive and i also think it's like all right let's take take it  in the context it deserves this is like sending a broadway show reviewer to an action movie right  you know i mean you you can pick it apart but people are going to enjoy it for what it is 
[01:06:00]  but it's also this guy's a snob you know what's annoying too because he the guy did the tgi at  friday's menu and you know what yeah i'm not saying it's as good as  mario batali's a signature restaurant right but a lot of this shit at friday's is good  sorry like stuff like uh you know stuff up on the wall that artichoke and chips what's that dip  fuck i can't eat it anymore but it's amazing dude it's it's fucking amazing  that's why i hate these critics because they're not they don't like you said they don't review 
[01:06:30]  things according to what they're comparing them to right okay this is not the porterhouse steak  restaurant in in the time warner building it's not meant to be that in time square it's uh it's  made for a lot of people probably a high turnover of of tourists that come in there take it for what  it is i'm sure guy knows exactly what it is he does he's not under he's not under any illusions then  again maybe it's not good i mean it's like i'm bashing this reviewer and i haven't eaten in the  restaurant that's the reviewer may still be pissed about what guy did to me that's you know that's one 
[01:07:00]  thing you know what we all are sam yeah our young sam by what he did to you meaning by not murdering  i just tweeted him we should get him on the show i think guy fieri will come in you know come on and  talk about this it's good food i eat there yeah roland says it's good and i'm serious he's a he's  a true foodie he knows all right and you'll write him as well because i don't know i don't know if he's  up reading his twitter right now when you have a second mr fieri would you see what happened to the 
[01:07:30]  black bean and roasted squash soup we ordered what happened guess it didn't get there oh  hey did you try that blue drink the one that glows like nuclear waste  the watermelon margarita any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde  maybe because the glass was dirty maybe he knew what the reviewer was going to write and he actually  did bring some radiator radiator it's called antifreeze these reviewers are complete assholes 
[01:08:00]  they're intense they're egomaniacs yeah my brother had to go through that like they'll call ahead of  time and like yeah within the next couple of days we're sending our guy over there best so then he's  on his best behavior on high alert for like two straight days and then the you know the person  dramatically enters your restaurant with a few people and then you have to sit there and and you got  to make sure it's completely perfect instead of just going anonymously right which is what they  should do no they announced themselves they they want to make a big production of it 
[01:08:30]  and they and they almost want everyone in the restaurant to be aware that they are now in the  food critic is there yeah oh they're just twats you have a picture of this who is this reviewer i  want to see you i'm just curious not that it matters i'm just curious let me find out as to what  this snooty fucking jizz bag looks like a snooty jizz bag i have zero interest in what a reviewer  from the time says zero uh i i would think there's a lot of snooty idiots that work for the new york 
[01:09:00]  times yeah look they probably have they probably make some great pitch but guys right the way they  brutalized lady gaga's place too like her parents even if it's not a good restaurant you know they're  going out of their way to be extra shitty because they're attacking a high profile that's in our  that's in our neighborhood and i and i know people they say it's horrendous oh really is that  bad okay they say that place is horrendous yeah this guy looks like a fucking cunt but look would  you ever hang out with that guy who fucking who droopy eyes neck mcgillicuddy no why would i 
[01:09:30]  his eyes and neck they they switch them for droop factor no i would he looks like a radio programmer  i think i've worked for that guy four different times four different cities look at him he knows what's  best this dumb smile let's call him up yeah what are we doing let's call this guy up and let's call  up guy fieri because by the end of the interview we'd be gone yeah you're cool now we get it no  because the guy might say look guys it really wasn't good like it's hard to defend it unless  we've eaten there i like guy but it might suck his language in this article is

[01:19:00]  Travis making a very good point  we got the dumb Rockefeller Christmas tree  they make a big deal about it every year  I guess tourists come from all over the country 
[01:19:30]  all over the world to see the Rockefeller Christmas tree  oh they sure do  which is a mere what block block and a half from here  yeah  and uh  down on the democracy fucking uh  what is it  what is it  democracy plaza  what is it  yeah  and uh  they have to have a story every year to make it all nice and uh they uh romanticize the whole fucking thing  where the tree came from  to justify the fact that as awful human beings we just fucking just chop shit down when we're ready to use it 
[01:20:00]  and uh this year they got a tree where from where it's from Flanders New Jersey  Flanders New Jersey  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  stupid Flanders  sexy Flanders ruled  it made me puke because they had to go  this tree survived  Sandy  oh so is it a story of survival  yes  um blah blah 
[01:20:30]  but then Jimmy quickly pointed out it survived Sandy and then we fucking chop it down  yeah  that's great  yeah  it's fucking murder  yeah  they're saying it's a powerful symbol of the region's strength in this time of crisis  yes it is  you survive something and then something else kills you  that's a great message  and who's the owner of the tree that decided to  to sacrifice the Sandy tree  yeah  hey made it through Sandy  get the chainsaw  if it made it through the storm  why wouldn't you then maybe put a plaque up like this  magnificent  magnificent tree survived Sandy 
[01:21:00]  yeah  enjoy it here  instead of  sawing it down  so when the president pardons a turkey  wouldn't it be funny one year if he put the turkey in the lawn  instead of pardoning it  he kicked it in the stomach  you just hear that thug sound that a turkey would make  and it's like  it's all hurt and walks away  broken weight  what did it do  eat your fucking steak  oh  oh  wow that's right  linger  very long  yeah  yeah  linger longer 
[01:21:30]  why is my turkey sick  the veterinarian says my turkey's got a liver disease  shh  I don't think that was the cause of a liver disease  might have helped things along a little bit  but  fuck  never seen a dog with jaundice before  amazing  oh boy  I love the duty  who didn't  she treated me nice 
[01:22:00]  so  so we got this tree  it survived Sandy  and then  what do they do  they chop it down  to the  chop it down  road in Rockefeller Center for tourists  yeah  dress it up like a fucking tranny  I'm just standing humiliated  is that the equivalent of dressing up  of course it is  when you put your shit on your tree  there's a tree  I got a tree over my house  they're craning it onto the truck  which will probably have trouble finding enough gas to drive to the city  but it is what it is  you can't say it survived the super storm and then chop it down 
[01:22:30]  yeah  and we're also all supposed to feel good about that  yes we are  they killed the fucking tree  but think of the joy  in the children's eyes  when they  see the tree lit up  in Times Square  have you ever gone down  and checked out the tree  it's not a joy for anyone  it's a pain in the ass  you got smelly homeless guys  trying to fucking take your picture with the tree  every five seconds  bunch of pickpockets down there  it's crowded and freezing fucking cold  goodbye  I'd rather see the tree in my own house 
[01:23:00]  it's almost as tall  I got thrown out of the Times Square area  looking at that tree  it's Rockefeller Center  yeah whatever  they're like  you gotta get out of here sir  you're not authorized to search people  what you were searching people  yeah they were stealing pine needles off the tree  that's a horrible thing to steal  yeah  I was down there with my Santa outfit  oh  yeah you want a gift  were you making young children's wishes come true 
[01:23:30]  sure  I said come in the bathroom  I'll see if you've been naughty and nice  how do you tell if a child's been naughty or nice  Uncle Paul  well you put your glove in there  and you do the glove test  what's the glove test Uncle Paul  you put a finger all the way in there  you make sure  he's waiting to get to the part that's really disturbing  and you taste it  you see  you could taste naughty or nice  sure you can  what does nice taste like  you suck on the end of the glove  and you taste nice 
[01:24:00]  what does naughty taste like  tastes like pee pee  alright  Jesus  cause somebody's nervous  nervous  whenever they're nervous  cause they're getting searched  you gotta suck the end of the glove finger  hey what are you doing in there  get in here so Santa can check you good  let Santa Claus check you  you don't think that might traumatize a child  throughout their life  that Santa would have done something so inappropriate  put coal in a stocking 
[01:24:30]  coal?  yeah  give you a lump of coal  if they're naughty  or they're tattletales  yeah  remember  always you have secrets with Santa  do you threaten that Santa won't bring him any toys  if they speak up?  yeah he say  if you go out there and start tattletaling  I'm gonna fly  me and the reindeers  they're gonna go right around your house  no gifts for you  that's a terrible thing to do  yeah  you're gonna get a lump of coal in your stocking  is that code word for something? 
[01:25:00]  yeah  I remember the cookie you left me  me and me Santa Claus  yeah  yeah  Uncle Paul knows how to ruin a good fucking Christmas  I love how everyone has their moment where they tap out of Uncle Paul  that's alright  some right at the beginning  others it takes a little while  everybody's yelling  why is that Santa Claus standing so close to the kids behind them?  yeah  you lift them up to look at the tree  and all of a sudden everybody's yelling 
[01:25:30]  hey why's your head under her dress?  she's looking at the tree  the wind blew it  oh see it was just the wind blowing  a misunderstanding  parable misunderstanding  I understand  your pants fell down  I didn't pull a snow pants down  they slipped  how does snow pants slip?  don't they usually have suspenders?  it's almost impossible  buckles  yeah  they're strange  yeah  they're hard to work with your gloves  oh Uncle Paul 
[01:26:00]  you're incorrigible  his name should be Uncle Grody  fuck  I don't need to go through emotions like that  you don't like Valleyship?  I hate Valleyship  Uncle Grody  do you know one day I was walking around my house  I swear to God  you don't have to sell me  and I was thinking  who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Grody  Uncle Grody  with the creepy old guy stare 
[01:26:30]  Uncle Grody  Uncle Grody  I hate  I hate  Valley Jim  Chip  Valley Chip  Valley Jim  that's Valley Jim  Valley Jim  oh yeah  I get confused  I was singing that alone in my house  like what the fuck  are you multiple personalities?  I really think I'm going insane  because I can't fucking get  these songs out of my head  every day I'm walking around my house  and it's either  we are the dinosaurs walking  we are the dinosaurs 
[01:27:00]  marching  marching  we are the dinosaurs  what do you think of that?  we are the dinosaurs  marching  marching  we are the dinosaurs  we make the earth flat  we make the earth flat  well  no shit  yeah that one  what about the new version?  I don't even want to say it  what about the new version of the dinosaur song  that we played yesterday? 
[01:27:30]  I do like that  I do like that one  did it make the  of course it did  okay good  but then there's  yeah  just say it so we can all listen  it sticks in my head  the Manfredi song  yes  get your car  the Manfredi way  honestly  the Manfredi way  I like how it kicks in  that second verse  here it comes  here it comes  oh shit  come to us  now the drums  are fucking killer  there's a better way  to save  the Manfredi way 
[01:28:00]  get your car  the Manfredi way  on Highland Boulevard  today  we care about you  every day  when you're ready  go to the Manfredi  yay  okay fuck it  what's next  we're giving that guy  a lot of free spots  I know right  where's our plugola Sam  no it's not a commercial  I swear  huh  that's not how it works  you can't go on the air  and demand plugola  I'm demanding plugola  what do I get 
[01:28:30]  a car  you're gonna give me a car  for free for a while  I tell that story  all the time  by the way  we passed the dealership  a lot  yeah  that we got our  I forgot the name  of the car  Lexus right  yes  yeah  the Lexuses  because me and Ann  both got a Lexus  to drive around  for free  for like a month  longer for me  and then  they pretty much  had a repo  the one Ann had  yeah I wouldn't  give it back  I had to literally  take it  I'm not done with it yet 
[01:29:00]  what are you gonna do  take it  and take it  eventually  it was a sad day  when I had to give it back  I was like  fuck  this car rules  I loved it  I went skiing with it  just beat the shit  out of the car  man fucking tastic  actually it didn't work  well in the mountains  no no  it really slid a lot  in the snow  you need those  back wheels man  oh by the way  also that stupid  fucking  the Thanksgiving song  really  yeah  this got stuck in my  I walk around my house 
[01:29:30]  going  the turkey  it's because  you've watched it  like 30 times  no  here it is  yeah  hey  we  we  yeah  with what  potatoes  whose snotty  kid is this  by the way  oh no  where daddy  has a lot of money  that's what it is  daddy has a lot of money  they take these  snotty kids  and they get  like the best  fucking producers 
[01:30:00]  out there  and go hey  and make my kid a star.  No, it's one guy, dude.  That black guy that's in the video,  he has a stable of these girls.  So where's he getting them from?  They're rich, fucking little snotty girls  that go to him,  they give him all kinds of money,  he writes the song,  records it,  and makes a video for them.  Because the dumb housewives  get these producers.  Because they have so much fucking money.  And you know these producers  don't want to work with them?  It's Thanksgiving.  Ski-living.  We're gonna have a good time. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, oh, oh, it's Thanksgiving.  We, we, we're gonna have a good time.  Yeah, I just fucking sing this around.  I want to make an upbeat music video.  Let's do it.  A happy, upbeat music video.  Oh, God, Jimmy, that'd be great.  But you gotta film it like this.  A real one?  Yeah.  Like the party atmosphere?  What's it gonna be about?  I don't know.  It's gotta be something really simple.  The party, something about the party.  Yeah, the party.  It's, it's just called the party.  Yeah, like, uh,  you don't have to think any further than that. 
[01:31:00]  The party.  Go to, uh, go to,  and we, uh, parody all these other fucking videos  that, uh, there's a bunch of them like this out there now.  Yeah, go to the guy's name,  the actual account for YouTube.  Yeah, Patrice Wilson.  Yeah, he did Rebecca Black.  And look at his stable  that he has of all his videos.  They're all the same.  Which is your favorite?  Look.  Which is your favorite?  My favorite?  Let me look.  He gets a lot of views, man.  There's, uh...  These are all the ones he's, uh,  got in his stable, huh?  All right, go to the one,  second row down, 
[01:31:30]  all the way to the right.  The blonde.  And the songs are all, like, the same.  This is Hannah Ross'  How do you know this?  Perfect You.  But how would you know this much about it?  Uh, because...  We gave you a pass on the one song yesterday.  No, no.  But you know all of them?  No, because this guy...  Look, it's the same thing.  Pre-teen girl.  Can I see it, Sam?  You're not home having a party here.  He loves...  He loves children feet.  Yeah!  This guy's a creep.  No, he's not.  All right.  He's not...  Now, was that you talking into the mirror?  Pat Wilson.  And it's the same thing. 
[01:32:00]  Listen.  Eh, eh.  Eh, eh.  It's the same song.  So you've seen this one as well?  Yeah.  I went through every one of his videos.  Why wouldn't I?  I don't know.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Because he's got a gimmick here.  But he's capturing...  He's trying to just grab quick money for...  Yes, he is.  It's smart.  This guy's brilliant.  He's got to be a multi-millionaire off the shit.  He's got to be.  It's amazing.  Well, we got another song.  I want to get stuck in your head. 
[01:32:30]  Going to the party.  Jimmy's got it.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  I'm going to the party.  Is that what you're going to do?  Yeah.  We got to write it, or someone's got to write a song for Jimmy.  And then we got to do a professional, upbeat video where you're smiling and the camera's  moving around you.  Oh, God.  Well, your pool...  Now I'm at the party.  Your pool would be perfect.  I know, but it's all closed now.  I want to wait until spring.  Yeah.  We should get the Manfredi guys, whoever wrote that song.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Yeah, that's fucking catchy. 
[01:33:00]  I like that to be the chorus, though.  I'm going to the party.  Yeah.  Why are you doing that?  And you can point.  A lot of cuts.  A lot of quick cuts.  Look at his face.  A lot of you pointing.  A lot of you mugging for the camera with a smile on your face.  And winking.  Yeah.  And then you've got to have a segment where you just dance.  Yeah.  Oh.  Slow motion.  Like a little slow.  They slow it down.  Yes, yes.  Oh, this is great.  Maybe a list of things you're going to have to eat at the party.  At the party.  Some turkey.  Yeah, we're going to have soda, pop, potato, chips, what's that? 
[01:33:30]  We're going to have soda and chips and snacks.  Oh, we're going to the party.  Yeah.  That's going to be a big hit.  It's got to be around a pool, though.  It really does.  Inside party, I'll do it anywhere.  Yeah.  Could be at a ski lodge.  Yeah, wherever.  Maybe I'll wear a ski bunny hat.  Anywhere that there's a party.  Oh, you're all doing the ski lodge?  What?  I'll put on, like, a fake ski hat, and I'll hold skis inside, and I'll say,  I'm skiing to the party, and I'll mock skiing lodge. 
[01:34:00]  That's terrible.  A lot of good ideas here.  Skiing to the party.  Jimmy's party song.  We've got to do it, actually.  You, you, you.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Now you're talking.  Another one of our former interns.  Noah.  I want to hear the, I want to hear the chorus. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  This is great.  Julia.  It's kind of catchy.  Where's the, I want to hear the chorus.  Ow.  Ow.  Julia.  You're uncontrollable.  Oh.  Got me calling out of war.  Got me calling out of my war. 
[01:35:00]  He's terrible.  He's terrible.  This is great.  Twice my size girl.  You're hypnotized.  Twice my size girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Shame on my boy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It should be shame I brought on my father. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  You're uncontrollable.  Oh.  Got me calling out of war.  Got me crying out of love.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You don't like that? 
[01:36:00]  It is kind of catchy.  You know it is.  Were the comments disabled?  The video was taken off.  What?  He took the video down.  Why?  He has to do research to find it now.  He closes the camera.  Oh, damn.  Can we make sure we have a copy of it?  Well, I mean, if he closed his account, I hope that we had a copy of it before.  Did his dad finally see it?  But it's a good example of what you're talking about.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  His father had a lot of money and said, here, whatever you need, son.  He's even in a Bentley in the video.  Yeah.  A fucking Bentley.  People are saying, well, Kevin from Connecticut, Jimmy's song should be a cool pool party.  Yeah.  If we wait for the spring.  Maybe I could do it like that, but it's like, I'm going to the party.  Or the angles, a tranny party.  No, it's got to be a real video.  A tranny party is too tongue-in-cheek.  It's too Jimmy.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  I'm at the, we're going to have beer and Bacardi.  Very good.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Bacardi and party always go for it.  How about, um, uh, uh, uh, something with, uh.  Retardy?  No, it's too mean.  It's got to be a fun party song.  He's going for the real deal here.  Fun party.  Yeah.  You're talking, yeah, some Bacardi.  Don't be tardy.  Yeah.  Girls, too.  Yeah.  Hey, girls, don't be tardy.  Ladies. 
[01:37:30]  Ew.  Ew.  Hey, girls, don't be tardy.  It's terrible.  It's not terrible.  It's perfect.  I hope someone's recording this and then transcribe it because I'm not going to do it,  but it's all, it's all here right now.  Yeah.  We're going to the party.  We're going to have Bacardi.  Hey, girls, don't be tardy.  That's great.  I'm just clapping in the party song.  Fucking good, man.  Fucking good.  So get this party starty.  No.  What else rhymes with tardy? 
[01:38:00]  We're going to do one more.  Um.  Um.  Joe Girardi?  No.  All the girls will heart me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the girls will heart me.  Uh.  You don't like that?  No.  That's why it's perfect.  Ant does get these weird songs stuck in his head.  Yeah.  As well as weird obsessive thoughts. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  That's what happened to Bobby Fischer.  Really?  You do know that when a fucking genius unravels, they just get something stuck in their head.  Oh, shit.  I walk around my house singing the same songs.  Yeah.  I can't believe he got elected.  Whoa.  Oh, well, that's true.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we play the Lipa song?  Because I think that'll get stuck in your head.  I don't know that one.  It's a great song.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  I only wish we could come up with songs like this on our show.  It's amazing.  A radio station came up with this.  We're fucking very jealous and pissed off. 
[01:39:00]  The Lipa CEO, by the way, will resign at the end of the year.  They've been saying lights out for Lipa CEO.  Get it?  Yeah.  He also has an old power.  He was the interim CEO.  His power taken away.  Unplugged.  Unplugged.  Exactly.  He's obviously the sacrificial lamb.  Yes.  They had to do something because people are fucking pissed.  Of course, Lipa for the rest of the country.  Well, we can't say that because it's not local.  Bring them on board.  Long Island Power Authority.  What's Long Island? 
[01:39:30]  It's a little piece of shit that is attached to New York City.  Oh, yeah.  Keep it local.  I love Long Island.  Strong Island, baby.  Excuse me.  Anyway, what radio station came up with this?  We're very jealous.  W-M-B-L-I.  W-L-I out there in Long Island came up with the fucking Lipa song.  They got a video and everything, man.  Oh, boy.  You ready?  Sure am.  Oh, no. 
[01:40:00]  Morning mashup style.  Oh, no.  The lack of gasoline is leaving people online screaming.  We've been without power for 10 days and my family's freezing.  The amount of shoehorning in that first line is insane.  The screaming was bad, too, there.  When he said screaming and screaming.  Yeah.  He added something to that as well. 
[01:40:30]  Start over.  Start over and listen to the shoehorning that goes on.  Shoehorning is when they put the accent on the wrong syllable when they are making song parodies.  And it doesn't really fit.  No one says the word like that.  You're just jealous.  I am.  We should have came out in the years.  The lack of gasoline is leaving people online screaming.  We've been without power for 10 days and my family's freezing.  And Easy Mac for dinner every night is not appeasing.  Maybe Lipa's joking and they'll say, hey, we're just teasing. 
[01:41:00]  Everybody's cold.  We're sleeping with four blankets on.  My fridge is growing mold.  When will our power come back on?  10 days is what we're told.  I think I'm going to lose my mind because I can't charge my phone.  And now my car just died in line?  Damn it.  Lipa.  Can you help us?  Because we're cold.  Hey.  And without phones.  That's the kickdown.  Hey.  My cable's out.  Hey.  My heat is gone.  Hey.  And all these power lines are all over my lawn.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laa. 
[01:41:30]  Say it.  Opa Lipa style  nice  we  we  Lipa style  it really isn't that bad  I don't hate it as much as I thought  oh jeez  there's a young boy dancing with them  that kid's good  it's not that bad  you know what  it's a stupid radio thing  it's not our thing but it's not that bad  we can't kill everything  the radio station they work for 
[01:42:00]  they're people that listen to that  would love something like this  it's topical  the words are  they make sense  you can hear the vocals  it's not like they're buried  so as far as the song parody goes  you know what  and they're keeping up with the song  and all that  a little shit warning but honestly  we can't kill it  and the video  there was work put into the video  they actually are doing a video  it's kind of silly I don't mind it  it would be easy to just fucking shit all over it  you hate it?  because of what it is I don't 
[01:42:30]  it's way worse out there  keep it in the context  so many people love this  show me that dancing part again  Sam  I can't get cash for gas  because all the ATMs are dying  they say that we'll get power back 
[01:43:00]  I think that they are lying  my Facebook tells me they have gas  and seldom  I'm not buying  I'm running out of formula  my baby  I put the light switch on  and then I realized  there's no power  now there's snow on my lawn  man I could really use a shower  this is getting gross  if I have to wait one more hour  then it's adios  we'll stay with family in Montana  damn it  can you help us  because we're cold  and without phones 
[01:43:30]  my cable's out  internet gone  and all these power lines  are still all on my lawn  oh boy  why is the fucking kid in it  that just annoys me  jumping around  it must be  one of the guys' kids  that guy that's doing this  he looks familiar  does he?  yeah  the kid is a 
[01:44:00]  you know  because  eye candy  no  because Cy has a kid in the video  what?  because Cy has a kid in his video  you know what  there you go  I was wrong  that's the only reason  why don't they have any broads  in this one  Cy doesn't  he does  they probably couldn't get a girl  you got them Asian girls  with them chubby little legs  and you don't see the mashup  putting out music videos  you know what  well the mashup  wasn't even a lot  to talk about the storm  I heard  no they weren't  that's not true  that's not true 
[01:44:30]  not in detail  no  because you know why  why  it affected  where?  the east coast  but what is the mashup  is it the east coast  morning show?  don't you even say that  they are every town  but if they're stupid enough  to listen to a guy  that tells them that  then they deserve  everything they get  the mashups  in any town USA  guess what?  y'all come back now  it was one of those things  the whole country cared about  I was in LA  last Friday  as soon as I said  I'm from New York  people were like  oh my god  the storm 
[01:45:00]  how's everyone doing over there  we're thinking about you  when it happens  in New York City  right  everybody's aware of it  so what is this guy  talking about  that he told them that  people were interested  somebody said to me  in New York  they're like  how you doing  I'm like  my hat flew off  you cunt  sometimes  sometimes it's  but it becomes difficult  everyone in the country cares  Rich was saying  that they couldn't talk  about the subways flooding  because they can't say subway  they're not allowed to say subway  they can't say subway  where do they get their sandwich from 
[01:45:30]  that shithole  why can't they say subway  because a lot of parts of the country  what's a subway  you just tell them real fast  we call them subways in New York  can they say gay marriage  that's not everywhere  fucking dumb radio advice  stinks  most of it  you could say like a train  most of it is always dumb radio advice  took the underground train  radio guys are fucking  hacky radio advice  they're just idiots  they should be doing something else  how do you tell your

Just because I can. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my fucking God.  That really is terrible.  What an awful thing.  Like, Penn's coming in, and of course it says every day is an atheist holiday.  He doesn't believe in God, much like Ricky Gervais.  He's always arguing with these God people.  And you see something like that.  And, I mean, this mysterious ways thing doesn't really wash when there's...  What purpose would a God have for doing that to a person? 
[02:04:00]  It's amazing to me.  It's just the cruelty.  Why would we fucking embrace and worship the cruelty that this being would impart on?  Because he runs the show.  Because he runs the show.  We have no choice.  He needs to be feared and loved.  And then he just turns around and fucks people over like that.  I don't know.  That's amazing.  As useless as can be.  We've got to make time for the E-Rock shit, so we'll go to break with this. 
[02:04:30]  We've got Penn Jillette on the way as well, so we're going to get real busy.  So stay there.  Sirius XM Pearl Jam Radio's award-winning series of broadcast bootlegs continues.  After years of combing through hundreds of thousands of hours of archival audio,  Sirius XM filters the Pearl Jam concert experience into what true fans love the most.  Appreciate that very much.  That was good.  We'll probably do it again a little bit later.  But, oh, right.  Where'd I put my cane? 
[02:05:00]  Bah!  Sirius XM presents Pearl Jam Bootlegs, the intros.  As CNN brought you this concert, that's why you spent $800 for your ticket.  When you see the Rolling Stones, it's affordable because it's Budweiser Presents.  That's why you spent $800 to sit all the way up top with your neighbors that ride the bus.  This is rear view window.  Listen to Eddie Vedder at his most delusional.  You know, it was 44 years ago today that Richard Nixon was elected president.  So now Reggie Jackson with number 44.  And we're going to try to hit this one out of the park for you.  Well, this is our field who is the brains of JFK. 
[02:05:30]  Sometimes he's not even introing songs.  Well, it's just toast.  I don't eat eggs because it's dangerous for the chickens.  Everything people, I don't eat anything that has eyes.  An idea so brilliant, only Sirius XM management could have brought it to life.  And I got a Defeater maybe.  Maybe.  I'm getting a little wasted, so this is life wasted.  The complete Pearl Jam live experience with none of the music.  Don't sell out to the man, but you could buy my ukulele album at Starbucks.  All right.  Bye.  Another genius move by the radio wizards at Sirius XM. 
[02:06:00]  It's Pearl Jam live.  The intros this week exclusively on Pearl Jam Radio.  Enjoy your evening.  Get home safe.  Oh no, we're just getting warmed up.  That's what's great about Philadelphia.  Hey man, long time.  How's everything?  Pretty sweet, actually.  How's Gina?  Ah, we're done.  It's over.  I got a new chick now.  Want to see a pic?  Sure.  Fat titties, right?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, man, nice. 
[02:06:30]  Fucking three and a half pounds apiece.  Bam!  You know the exact weight of your girlfriend's breasts?  You don't?  Come on, I'll show you.  Han?  Hey, babe.  Sweetie, get a bowl and fill it to the top with water.  But I don't think they've gotten any big...  Just get it!  What's going on?  Here you go.  Hey man, do me a favor.  Go weigh this baking tray and write down the weight.  Okay, uh, half a pound?  Okay.  Babe, put a bowl of water in the baking tray and drown them titties like Rodney King. 
[02:07:00]  Great job, honey.  Now you see how the water is overflowing out of the bowl and being collected in the tray?  Now we'll need to measure the displaced water that's in the tray.  Because tissue is less dense than water,  we'll need to multiply that number by 0.9 to compensate.  And don't forget to subtract the weight of the tray.  So let's see here.  Times 0.9 and...  Bingo!  Three and a half pounds.  And that's legit?  Legit!  So, I assume you know how to weigh a giant cock.  Boy, do I!  Let me show you. 
[02:07:30]  Who the hell saw that coming?  I did!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we're going to get back into the E-Rock jingle slash audio contest.  It's a side contest.  We're doing the O&A jingle slash audio contest.  That's the big one.  But then we decide there were so many E-Rock ones coming in,  we had to have a side contest. 
[02:08:00]  And today we crown the winner of that said contest.  All right?  Right.  We got eight of them.  Eight?  That's a coincidence.  There's the first one.  So we need everyone to vote.  Who's in as far as voting goes, Sam?  Well, I think he said Sal is good for half a vote,  E-Rock for two votes.  I'm not quite sure.  But E-Rock for two votes.  Yeah.  Me, you, Anthony, Jim, and Danny and Travis. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, are they going to listen to all eight?  I hope so.  All right.  And then everyone just hands in the one they think wins.  Right.  And then we'll tally the fucking votes.  And that guy will win $500 courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com.  Right.  Pick a number.  Well, how am I going to do this?  I want to do this randomly so it's not influenced.  Oh, I see.  I don't know.  Start with three.  I don't have three on the sheet. 
[02:09:00]  Pick another number.  Seven.  I don't have seven.  Two.  I have two.  All right.  So this will be the first one.  Right.  It's the E-Rock audio slash jingle contest.  Oh.  Troy just texted me complaining that he would also like a vote.  I thought I said.  Oh, yeah.  Troy could vote.  Troy can vote.  I said Troy earlier.  Right.  Yeah.  Troy gets a vote.  A full vote, too.  Only Sal gets a half a vote.  Exactly.  He hasn't earned a full vote.  And E-Rock got two votes because it's all about him. 
[02:09:30]  Not.  Nope.  Oh.  Stop, Sam.  I'm just asking.  I need to clarify.  So the first finalist, it puts him in a really tough spot being played first.  Yeah.  Because this is one of my favorites, not to try to influence the vote.  It zeps.  Oh.  Gets played first.  That never works out.  Really?  No.  It's always like later on because the early ones always get the lower score because they  have to have some room to give higher scores.  That shit.  Yeah, I hear you.  Are you going straight down the list? 
[02:10:00]  I don't think we should.  Do you?  Oh, okay.  No.  I was just.  I was going random to try to make it as fair as possible.  And zeps.  Here's zeps.  He's a finalist.  Cake and pie and chocolate and sweets.  That is what E-Rock likes to eat.  All for himself.  He ain't sharing a bit.  That's why he has tits.  He's a fat piece of shit.  Let that sink in.  It's fucking short, sweet, simple.  Let that sink in.  Let that sink in. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  Yeah.  That was good.  All right.  I'll make you this a little easier.  So now I need 1, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, or 28.  Pick a number.  Nine.  And pick a number.  Well, let's write the top.  One.  Problem?  All right.  Problem.  One is another one.  A good age.  One's going to be another one in a tough spot.  This was the favorite all along.  I know which one.  Oh.  This is George Huckus. 
[02:11:00]  Feet up on the floor like I run the show.  Hokey in my mouth.  Hokey in my mouth.  He rock on me, nigga.  He rock on me, nigga.  He rock.  He rock.  He rock.  Fat boy in the seat.  Bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  I like it.  I'm really good.  Yeah.  I like that one.  Have you guys made your decision yet?  No.  I'm making my decision as we go.  Oh, good. 
[02:11:30]  Like, did I like that better than Zepp's?  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  I can't cancel one out.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock, are you listening too?  Are you listening closely?  I'm listening.  Closely, though?  Yes.  Okay, because it's a lot of money on the line.  I got my leader so far.  E-Rock Army really was like the Yankees.  Like, picked to win from the beginning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Groomed.  Yeah.  All right.  The next one is going to be Thomas Hamilton.  He made the finals.  All right.  Hamilton.  Hamilton.  E-Rock's a fat pig. 
[02:12:00]  E-Rock's a fat pig.  E-Rock's a fat pig.  E-Rock's a fat pig.  The Open Anthony Show with Jim Norton and a fat farm animal.  I like it.  All right.  I like that one, too.  That's a funny little ending.  This is for 500 bucks.  Yeah, it's cool.  Curse of IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[02:12:30]  The next finalist, who's got two in the finals, Sean F.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of size and weight.  I like that.  Worked in radio for a long, long time, but my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction and I hate my job, cause they make fun of my shape. 
[02:13:00]  Had to stay home after Sandy left, cause a branch blocked my escape.  Remember that?  Topical.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  Oh, yeah.  I've been known as Sex Bagel.  And I don't watch sports at all.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[02:13:30]  I love garlic, butter, salt.  So if you see me, show some sympathy.  Cause I don't count calories.  I shouted out, who broke the toilet seat?  When all the while, I knew it was me.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  All right. 
[02:14:00]  That's Sean F.  Sympathy for E-Rock.  It's really good.  I like that a lot.  I like that one.  E-Rock, do you like that one?  I'm not giving out my vote yet.  Oh.  I like that blatant I'm an asshole.  Right.  He really settles it, too.  He does.  Cause that's like a personality judgment.  Yes.  All right.  The next one is from Ron Roof.  He made the finals with this.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jam.  Whoa.  Big jam tits. 
[02:14:30]  Whoa.  Jelly.  Whoa.  Big jelly tits.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Tits.  What now? 
[02:15:00]  What now?  Whoa.  It's just so mean.  Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy,  Fatty Piggy, Fatty Piggy, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I think at the conclusion of this contest, by the way, we should finally get the jammer  jelly answer.  Cause we've never found out which one.  Yeah, I think you're right.  So that was Ron Roof, Hoagie Biting Man. 
[02:15:30]  Such a good title, too.  Hoagie Biting Man is great.  Can we get these on our Facebook page?  A lot of people are asking.  Could we at least put the finalists up there?  We could probably put them on, like, SoundCloud or something.  Yeah, we could.  SoundCloud, yes.  Maybe E-Rock could start.  Nice.  An E-Rock Jingle SoundCloud page.  They'll probably get lost.  The next finalist is Matt Lewis with this.  E-Rock's the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur. 
[02:16:00]  He eats everything.  Why do you think he's fat?  E-Rock's the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur.  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  He stops and eats some food.  He's always in the mood.  He stops and stuffs some food while he's found. 
[02:16:30]  He stops and eats some food.  And then he takes a snooze.  He stops and eats some food.  Then he sleeps at the board.  E-Rock's the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur.  He eats everything.  Why do you think he's fat?  E-Rock's the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur. 
[02:17:00]  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  I forgot the big ending there.  The big ending there.  Yeah.  True story.  That's a good one.  That's Matt Lewis.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  We have two to go.  E-Rock, do you have any early favorites yet?  You don't have to announce who.  I do.  You do?  Oh, all right.  I think I know which one E-Rock's going to vote for, 
[02:17:30]  because there's one that's decidedly less insulting than the rest.  I got three.  You're right.  I got three right now I'm deciding on.  And keep in mind, E-Rock has two votes,  so all the people that did jingles insulting E-Rock...  It could hurt him.  That's two votes.  It could really hurt him in the end.  Can he give both votes to the same piece?  Do what he wants.  They're his votes.  Yeah.  Although every other person in the room wholeheartedly enjoys E-Rock insulting jingles,  so that's another thing that you have to judge.  Right.  I just love that Sal gets a half a vote.  But they used to give someone else a half a vote because then Sal's vote doesn't count. 
[02:18:00]  It's true.  It might as well just be one vote.  Kenny's got a vote, too, right?  Kenny, are you listening to these?  No, I'm abstaining.  Why?  What's wrong with him?  He doesn't like when we make fun of E-Rock.  You don't?  No.  I always go for the underdog.  Or the overweight.  So what if we give E-Rock two and a half votes?  No, no.  Two votes is plenty for a man of his.  Yes.  His Raymond Massey stature. 
[02:18:30]  Josh Howell made the finals with this.  Oh, I forgot about this one, too.  Shit.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Anthony and little Jimmy Borden.  Travis, Sal, and Danny.  Roland, Troy, and Sammy.  But do you recall?  The most morbidly obese one of all.  Morbidly.  E-Rock, the shit dick fat fuck. 
[02:19:00]  He's a lazy piece of shit.  Shit he is again.  And if you ever saw him, you'd know him by his huge bitch tits.  All of the other assholes laugh and call him piggy boy.  They never let poor E-Rock have his hoagies and his shitty toys.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:19:30]  This is so...  This is hard.  It's so mean.  I mean, that's just well produced.  Damn it.  It's funny, man.  So mean.  There's so many of these.  They're all fucking hilarious.  There's not one bad one out of this bunch here.  I like that one.  Every one of these people should be rewarded for what they've done.  Yes.  That one gets me in the Christmas spirit and everything.  It's timely.  We're going to hear that so much throughout the entire holiday season.  Yeah, make sure I have that in front of me. 
[02:20:00]  I think.  Until Christmas is over.  The last finalist is another entry by Sean F.  Oh, man.  He's the one who loves garlic, butter, salt, and he does no work at all, but he loves to fucking eat.  He loves to fucking eat. 
[02:20:30]  And I said, he's the one who loves garlic, butter, salt, and he likes his fan kitchen, and he does no work at all, but he loves to fucking eat.  He loves to fucking eat.  And I said, Nago.  Nago.  Nago.  I like that. 
[02:21:00]  That rocks.  I like that, but not as much as the other ones.  I think his sympathy entry is better.  Oh, when he just screams out the...  Oh, God.  That's fucking fantastic.  I'm an asshole!  That is fantastic.  He just fucking sucks.  I'm an asshole.  This is tough.  Dude, this is very difficult.  It's a tough one.  Penn's here.  I got my top three.  You have your top three.  I'm down to two.  Well...  Does anyone need to hear another one? 
[02:21:30]  No.  Well, we could do this all day.  Yeah.  Anyway.  True.  Troy's coming in.  Sal.  Is Sal good in there with his half vote?  His sympathy vote?  Half a vote.  I know what I want.  You do?  Tough, tough call.  How are you doing, Troy?  I'm good.  You got your one?  Yeah.  I have top three, but I have it down to one.  I have it down to one.  You do?  There's a clear winner here.  In my mind.  Maybe we should start with the half vote, then hear the staff, then hear the talent, 
[02:22:00]  then hear E-Rock's two votes.  Okay.  Sal?  So a half vote would be...  Half vote?  Why don't we just hand him in and then someone quickly...  Hey, it's got to be secret ballot because I don't want other people voting...  That's right.  Fuck that.  ...basing it on other people's votes to undermine...  Yeah.  Well then, much like high school, I need a pen and paper.  I wrote with my left hand so you're not going to know that this is my vote.  Oh, that's secret.  Secret.  Secret.  Danny?  Thank you.  And Sal's got to denote on his thing that it only counts for half. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  Make it very clear that he only counts for half.  Make sure Sal does that because...  You can fold them up and toss them over here.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm surprised with the one I'm going with to tell you the truth.  Fold them up.  But everyone's going to know it's yours, Hank.  That's big.  Give me a big fucking red pen that bleeds through the goddamn paper.  How am I supposed to be secretive?  The secretive ballot.  You have a giant piece of paper.  I think it's only meant to be secretive.  No, no, I don't mind that they know it's me once it's out. 
[02:23:00]  But you can't just say, I vote for this, but then it'll influence somebody else's vote  before they put it in.  Gotcha.  And Iraq has not submitted...  Where'd it go, man?  Oh, no.  It felt right in there.  It's right there.  Oh, what the fuck are you?  So did everyone submit?  Iraq has not submitted his two.  He said he'll say his on the air.  Do you want to do mine on the air after you all voted?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We know what you're going to vote for.  No, we don't.  And we want to play the top three, so we've got to do third, second, and then finally 
[02:23:30]  the winner.  All right, so Iraq, then you should write yours down if we're doing top three.  Yeah, you've got to write it down.  Well, then we shouldn't announce it.  We should just play them.  We should give all the votes to somebody.  I'll go, here's third place, here's second, here's first.  Travis, you count.  And then Iraq can tell us what his two votes were.  I only voted for one.  You only do one.  Oh, okay.  Hopefully it'll work out.  Yeah, hopefully.  Maybe it won't.  Fuck, you're right.  I'm tallying up the votes now.  All right.  Is there an obvious winner?  Well, I've only done two.  Oh, okay.  Who's winning, Travis? 
[02:24:00]  Well, right now there's one that has a half point lead.  Iraq's a dinosaur.  This is really tough.  It's going to be down to those two.  I already know what the winner is.  What?  You have yours?  Is it the same two coming up?  No.  Okay.  We have four different ones so far.  Wow.  Iraq's a dinosaur. 
[02:24:30]  Is that what you voted for?  No.  It doesn't matter anymore.  It's just catchy.  I did not vote for that one, though.  I do like that one, too.  Two more votes.  I have a leader.  You don't have Iraq's votes yet.  No, I know.  I'm just saying right now.  He's going to hand them to you.  I have a leader.  I have a leader.  I have a leader.  I have a leader.  What?  Did you use?  What?  Is that yours?  Is this yours?  No. 
[02:25:00]  What's wrong with that?  Is that a song?  Yeah.  It was the...  This is how it was on my sheet.  Oh.  Hmm.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  That's a good one, too.  Yes.  That's a great one.  We thought for a second you felt bad for him.  Yeah.  I just titled the song wrong.  No, no.  I almost went with that one.  Did you?  I feel...  And then we have to count Erock's two right now.  Now I need Eric's votes.  Put your two in.  Erock. 
[02:25:30]  I've got...  Do we have a clear three?  Top three?  You should have done.  Yeah.  Two.  Two.  Two.  One and a half.  How do you have two?  Oh.  Two and a half.  Oh.  Each one plus one.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  All right.  Of course.  Well.  I do have...  Is this for two votes?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Well, we have a winner.  Do we have a top three, though?  Oh, man.  Uh, we have one...  That's two and a half, right?  That's one and a half.  But isn't this one...  Yes, but I made sure to remind myself that it was half of it.  Oh. 
[02:26:00]  So, one, two, and then we have a tie for third place.  Well, how do we do that?  I guess we'll have to play all four.  We got Pendula waiting.  That's the only problem.  So you just want to play the top two?  Yeah.  No, I want to do this properly, so maybe we could go back to this.  Yes.  Okay.  We'll go back to this.  We have plenty of time before Stone comes in.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  We'll go back to it.  All right.  We'll go back.  We'll announce the winner of the E-Rock...  Oh, I need to know.  ...jingle slash audio contest, but Pendula's here early. 
[02:26:30]  And we do have Chris Tucker at 925, so it's getting a little crazy around here.  Because I don't want to rush through it.  No, yeah, you're right.  You're right.  All right, so we'll go back to that.  Can't rush greatness.  No, of course not.  Let's get Pendula in here.  Bring Penn in.  Oh, you want to take Penn's area?  Yeah, clean up his area.  So we'll do the top four?  Move your ass, yes.  Is it a definite top four?  Yes.  So there'll be a tied for third, a second, and a first.  Yes.  All right, and we'll announce that, I don't know, within the hour, hopefully.  Do you want to break or bring Penn in?  We can keep going, I guess.  Okay.  Yeah.  How long does he have? 
[02:27:00]  He's got a while.  All right.  Well, we've got Chris Tucker, too.  Yeah.  We'll film the wall.  Film the wall.  Yeah, it's fine.  So we roll.  Oh, we don't have a camera set up?  All right, we'll take a quick break.  Do a quick break.  We'll have Penn's lead next.  Yes.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Let's get Penn Jillette in here.  Penn!  Exactly.  Exactly.  There he is.  What's up, Penn?  Hello, Penn, sir. 
[02:27:30]  God damn, look at that nice suit you're wearing.  It is.  What's going on with you?  That's nicer than usual there.  Okay, good.  I've stepped up in the world.  I like that.  I saw this guy out there.  Yes, hi, buddy.  Love my life.  Hi, Penn.  Good to see you, man.  Penn.  Here I am at home.  Yes.  The place I truly belong on earth.  Exactly.  Right here.  Sitting right here.  We were watching you on what they call the television earlier.  Were you?  Were you?  Televised interview.  Looking very fresh on TV.  Was it that Fox thing? 
[02:28:00]  It was the Fox thing.  Yeah, it was great.  What do you think about the political?  I have no opinion of it, really.  Is there any way I can get a joke in here?  The woman said, you'll love this.  You know, the woman, this is, there was a woman on there that, there's a, women pundits  have this kind of style thing they do.  Yeah.  And she sat down between us and the host making small talk as narcissistic celebrities do  said, how many Twitter followers do you have? 
[02:28:30]  He said, you know, whatever her name was, Donna, I think.  Yeah.  And she said, I have 56,000 Twitter followers.  And the other two men went, huh?  Like with real disgust.  56,000.  And she said, but they're all really good.  I really picked them carefully.  Right.  And I said, what the fuck are you talking about?  Right.  You pick your Twitter followers carefully.  She said, no, I have an assistant that weeds out all the porno and all the stalkers.  As opposed to quantity.  And I said, she said, how many do you have? 
[02:29:00]  And I said, hundreds.  I have hundreds of followers and I have slept with every one of them.  My assistant makes sure that my penis has not been in them.  They are not.  How do you say you have a higher quality Twitter followers?  That is one of the most desperate claws.  It's like winning a sporting event, but then the losing team saying, but the points I scored  was so much better than yours.  It's all about numbers.  It's sport nice and clean.  Right.  Nice and clean score. 
[02:29:30]  You deal with a lot of haters just to keep your numbers up.  Fucking assholes.  If you want to weed out the assholes from Twitter, you're down to maybe four followers.  Let me see.  I have Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins.  They're following me.  Don't people understand that's what real friendships are for?  Like the low number, high quality are the people you actually interact with.  That's real life.  Twitter is all about fucking numbers.  Yeah.  And if the 56,000 is not a good number either way, if you have 56,000 quality relationships, 
[02:30:00]  you're fucked up.  Right.  If you have 56,000 Twitter followers, you're fucked up.  It's the wrong number for everything.  Wrong number for every type of relationship.  Almost.  I think for everything.  For everything.  Name something that 56,000 is the best number for.  Yeah.  It's not even good for it.  Blowjobs you've received this week.  There you go.  Jimmy has the best number.  Better than 57,000.  Good point.  I don't know the best number.  I mean, the best number for sex, three. 
[02:30:30]  You know, we already know those numbers.  But the best number, 56,000 for anything?  No, no.  I know we're going to talk about your book, but I have to ask you.  We don't have to talk about my book.  People know what I'm on here.  Beautiful.  I'm pipping something.  Beautiful.  I'm pipping the fucking book.  It's called Every Day is an Atheist Holiday.  Go out and buy it.  We have a book signing.  Now we can talk.  Okay.  Nice.  I want to talk about mediums.  I think you've talked about it on our show before, but I'm obsessed with the Long Island  broad because she...  And Jimmy says you can't, like, call them frauds. 
[02:31:00]  No, you can't.  Oh, no.  You can't call them frauds.  Why can't you call them frauds?  Don't sue you.  Don't sue you.  Don't sue you.  They are, as a rule, a litigious lot.  Yes.  Now, remember a television program called Penn and Teller Bullshit?  Sure.  Yes.  One of my favorite shows.  A lot of people assholes.  Right.  A lot of people fuckwads.  Right.  I called a lot of people, which I like this one, we made it up, cunt pickle.  Oh.  We called you this cunt pickle.  You know, that kind of...  Right.  I didn't mean to gesture to you.  It's okay.  I've been called worse.  Yes. 
[02:31:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we couldn't think of worse.  And it's completely accurate.  But you can't say fraud.  Why?  What you want to do...  And Al Goldstein taught me this.  Right.  Al Goldstein said, if you're on TV or in public and you're really pissed at someone, make sure  you use obscenity.  Stupid motherfucker, you won't go to court.  Liar, right to court.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because a guy can't really go into court and say, your honor, he called me a stupid motherfucker.  I don't think I am a stupid motherfucker. 
[02:32:00]  You know, dickwad, you know, asshole, all really good.  Liar, fraud, cheat, go right to prison.  Take all the money you've ever made, give it right to the Long Island medium.  Just like that.  Write a check directly.  I had a debate about her recently and somebody was talking about how she's real and then she  was talking about how she had talked to mediums and they...  Well, it is an opinion, you know.  Well, you got to end that. 
[02:32:30]  No, no, no, no.  Not if you say liar or fraud.  Oh, no, no.  But if he said she's not real in my opinion.  I mean, that's a fair point to say.  I don't think it's legit.  I'm so glad we have a lawyer here.  Yeah.  Because otherwise I'd be really nervous.  Well, in my opinion, there's a huge difference in litigation where if you're offering an opinion  and a fact, a statement of fact is a dangerous thing, but in an opinion, you're allowed  to have an opinion if you express it as an opinion.  Saying not real isn't calling someone a liar either.  Better off with asshole.  Yeah, you're right.  But you're the expert here, sir. 
[02:33:00]  And Jimmy was going to say, and I apologize for cutting Jimmy off, that a lot of people  believe in this.  I absolutely don't.  Yeah.  There's nothing to it.  Okay.  There's nothing to it at all.  And what's really sad about it...  So why can't you call these people out?  You can.  But in the way you said.  You will go to court, and it will be really, really stupid expensive.  Right.  When Uri Geller hit, you know, the guy who bent the spoons with his mind, ostensibly. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Amazing Randy, my dear friend...  Love him.  Get him on our show, please.  I can do that.  We'd love to have him on.  We'd love to have him on.  Amazing Randy in England said that he was something like, not the exact quote, but the idea was  he was fooling scientists with tricks he learned from the back of cereal boxes.  Apparently, scientists don't eat much cereal.  That was the quote in England. 
[02:34:00]  Now, England is really nutty because you can sue without being countersued if you do it in  the USA, if you're not an American citizen.  Americans are fucked on this with people from other countries.  So there was a court case that ended up costing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Oh, man.  And Randy did fine.  Randy didn't lose, but it was hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation because  he, you know, you, how could he prove absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt that Geller didn't 
[02:34:30]  have any powers?  And when I would do one of your competitor radio show here in town, I used to get faxes  before I'd go on Stern and the faxes would say, dear Penn, let you know I'm really listening  to you on Stern.  Sincerely, Uri Geller.  Wow.  Things like that would come in.  And it would be, it's amazing.  Those, those, those, those, they're very, very, you know, litigation is a really good 
[02:35:00]  way for them to get publicity and they have a budget for that.  So they would love nothing more than to have Opie in a, in a little lawsuit.  And doesn't Randy say, I have found no evidence of it being true.  No evidence.  Like that, but that's the way he phrases it.  And it's like to call somebody a fraud is a very, I would never, I personally just don't  buy it.  I don't think that that's a possible thing.  You know, you know why you won't say that?  Because you're a fucking fraud, if you were real, you would say what you felt.  I'm going to sue you. 
[02:35:30]  I'm going to sue you, but it's for telling the truth loudly.  So, so, so how do they do this to, in my opinion, how can a person be read like to,  and to be, in my opinion, tricked into believing that this person, and I'm not even talking  about her anymore, just in general, is talking to someone, talking to someone from the afterlife.  What's their technique?  Well, you can't ever pick one particular situation and then say, this is how it's done. 
[02:36:00]  Because there is an amalgam of all sorts of stuff that happens, and you're thinking on  your feet, and you're also getting lucky.  I'll give you an example of getting lucky that's beyond belief.  We used to do a thing, which was a seance, where we thought that a lot of people who were  atheist and skeptic tended to think the people that believed this stuff were stupid.  So, way back in the early 80s, before we did off-Broadway or anything, Teller and I  would be hired for private parties, of all skeptics, and we would say, we are fakes, we 
[02:36:30]  are frauds, total bullshit, but from here on, we're going to pretend we're not.  And we're going to do a full-blown seance with table rattling and the whole thing.  And people would think it was going to be this funny little arc, and we would scare the living  shit out of people.  Wow, really?  We stopped doing it in about 84, 85.  We hit off-Broadway.  And in about 1990, Spielberg had heard about the seances, and that only, you know, that 
[02:37:00]  fewer than 100 people had seen them, and that we had stopped doing them.  And all he wanted from his friends...  Mitch Spielberg, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For a bachelor party.  Wow.  Was for Penn and Teller to do the seance for 12 of his friends.  How cool is that?  And it was like, you know, Harrison Ford and Dustin Hoffman.  Holy shit.  So we flew out.  We took a night off from our Broadway show and flew out to do this seance we hadn't done  in five or six years.  And one part of it that was just horrendous and just freaked people out. 
[02:37:30]  Now, we tell everybody it's fake, but once we start going, we said if anybody says anything  about being fake, after we start, we just leave.  It's just done.  It's just over.  So you pretend you believe for this amount of time, you know, and don't bust us.  And there's, you know, perfume from there and holding hands and all of this.  And we did this one section that was so creepy, where we had these pictures of atrocities  and sexual perversions that we had gotten, that we'd hand out all around.  Or Jimmy's Hard Drive, as we call it. 
[02:38:00]  Really creepy, unpleasant shit.  We handed around about 20 pictures.  And we asked each person to pick a picture that gave them the strongest reaction, which  is also really uncomfortable in front of people you know, to say, here, you know, the picture  of this guy's face being blown off, you know, that's the one I'll take.  And then we would gather those up, right?  And we would shuffle them up.  And we would pick one and put it down there.  And then we would take some blood and put it in a Petri dish, you know, and run it over 
[02:38:30]  a slate, and this very mystical wording would appear, writing.  And then we would sit there for 10 minutes with these people going, wonder what that means.  You know, we had to pretend we didn't know what it meant.  And they would all sit around figuring, and someone would finally figure out that it meant  Deuteronomy and a chapter and verse.  And they'd run and get a Bible.  And there, in that chapter and verse in the Bible, was the exact description of the atrocity 
[02:39:00]  we were looking at.  And it was just blood-curdling.  And this whole trick, you know, this kind of magic, that intimate, close magic, is very  slow.  You know, you want a two-minute act in a live show, but sitting around with 12 people,  you can go 25 minutes on this creepy thing.  And it comes out.  Now, we rehearsed this, and there is a move you do.  You collect the 12 selected pictures of the many, and then we're shuffling them and going 
[02:39:30]  through them.  And the hero one, the one we want, is marked.  And then Teller's doing a move, and I'm doing a move.  And we end up forcing the picture we're going to do, right?  Forcing.  There's a trick.  Serious tricks without pictures chosen.  Then there's a way to get the thing on the slate.  So we're prepared to do that, right?  So we get there, and we lay the pictures out, and Spielberg goes,  I want this one.  And you're not taking it out of my hand.  I want this one.  Because he knows there's a trick coming. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, shit.  He grabs one and says, I want this one.  No way out.  We are belly up, dead in the water, floating.  Then he turns the picture, and he's holding the hero.  He is now holding.  We now have six minutes of work that we do not have to do.  Right.  He is just dumb.  It's just pure dumb luck.  And he didn't even pick the one that grabbed him.  He picked the one that was random just to fuck with us. 
[02:40:30]  He didn't even look at it.  I want this one, and his hands gripped on it.  I won't let go of it.  And I'll show them.  I won't let go of it.  He's holding it.  That's great.  And I, you know, because I'm not as much of a professional as I should be,  I made eye contact with Teller for a second, which I never should have done.  And Teller just goes,  So I say to Spielberg, no, no, look at all of them.  Do you want to change your mind?  Oh, wow.  And he goes, no. 
[02:41:00]  And I'll go, really, really, look at all of them.  Really, look at all of them.  Do you want to change your mind?  No.  And he holds it.  And I go, all right.  Okay, let's get some blood and try this.  I'm sorry.  I don't know if this will work.  You might have screwed us up.  You might have screwed us up, you know.  You might have screwed us up.  And we go through that, and the writing comes out, and they go to the Bible. 
[02:41:30]  It describes it exactly.  And everyone at the table, I mean, actually gets like a little woozy.  Oh, wow.  And I say to them afterwards, which is so funny,  I want you all to remember exactly what happened here.  And every single magician you meet, you tell them what happened and ask them how we did it.  You just ask them.  Now, if you're doing magic all the time, if you're doing tricks all the time, 
[02:42:00]  that's going to happen.  That's going to happen.  If you have an asshole that reaches into a deck and just pulls one out,  and you don't see it, and you haven't picked it out,  you haven't done anything, and says,  tell me what this card is.  And you say seven of diamonds.  More than once in a hundred times, you're going to be right.  That's true.  And there's a lot of tricks.  There's a lot of tricks that are one-on-one where you just plain do that.  Take a shot that's one in ten, and if you hit, it's over. 
[02:42:30]  It's a miracle.  And it looks amazing.  All you need to do is have another trick that's really good you can go into.  It's a thing called Dave Vernon, who's the father of contemporary close-up magic,  did all these what's called tricks you can't possibly figure out.  And they are all multiple outs, which means I start the trick.  You think I know what trick I'm doing, and I don't.  I have 20 tricks that I could be doing, depending on what you do. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  You know?  If he happens to hold it up so I see a reflection in his glasses, that's the trick I'll do.  If he happens to tip it like this, that's the trick I'll do.  If he reaches into the middle of the deck, where I know I've got a little stack and a plug,  that's the trick I'll do.  So there's an answer for any direction.  It's almost like Mad Libs in a weird way.  Any direction you're going in.  The guys that are really good, there was a cat named Eddie Fector,  who worked up in Buffalo, New York, at a place called the Forks Motel.  This guy learned his magic in the joint. 
[02:43:30]  He had, like, you know, jailhouse tats all over him.  Big, fat guy, Eddie Fector.  And the way he would practice magic, okay?  This is how advanced he was.  The way he would practice magic, he would take two decks of cards,  shuffle them both, take the deck of cards in his hand,  turn over the top card, okay?  No way he could know what it was,  no way he could have any idea what it was going to be,  then he would do a miracle with the deck he had in his hand.  Just glimpse down, see if you saw it on the top, see if it was on the bottom, 
[02:44:00]  look at the top three, top four, cut it, try it again,  while he's talking, do the whole thing,  and then find a way to make that interesting.  Put a 12 down and spell it.  Seven of clubs.  Put a 15 down and spell it.  And, you know, queen of, you know, diamonds.  You know, he knew how to spell every word, the age, everything.  How many children do you have?  Put it fourth from the top.  If you can't quite glimpse it,  say you'll find the suit and the number with two other cards.  You have the seven of diamonds.  Oh, here's a seven.  Here's a diamond.  Put them together. 
[02:44:30]  And he would do that all day long.  So no trick.  No trick, just ad-libbing.  Okay, put that together.  Once you have that kind of toolbox that anything you do, I'm just comfortable,  now take someone who's not like you, an asshole at a party that wants to see a car trick,  but take someone that's grief-stricken, full of pain, desperately wanting to hold on to something.  Then you go in with that same fucking toolbox. 
[02:45:00]  That incredible toolbox.  And you are doing this, you are picking a fight with someone who is in the hospital.  I mean, that's what you're doing.  You're in full fighting form.  You're ready to go.  You're ready to do anything.  And they've just come out of surgery.  You know, you don't need to have all those great moves.  All that being said, the fact that never could anyone explain the trick we did for Spielberg,  because it involves, you know, if someone said to you, 
[02:45:30]  how did Penniteller do that?  And the magician said, I think they got lucky.  You go, bullshit!  Get out of here!  They didn't go into Spielberg's house thinking they'd get lucky?  Yeah.  And you go, well, no, but they had another trick to do.  They didn't do that trick.  I did that once on a talk show.  We were going out on Letterman, and Letterman just happened to pick the card that we were  going to force in the next trick that was already loaded.  Wow.  And just went, oh, ta-da! 
[02:46:00]  Now we go right.  We go right to that.  Now it's that trick, yeah.  If you have that information in your head.  But when you add to that, one of the things you'll hear people do, if you want to do a  real psychic reading, the first thing is to get people to believe there's some way you're  doing that.  You cannot do it as a joke, because belief is really part of it.  Then, if you just say things and take them back, they're true for everybody. 
[02:46:30]  Let me show you what I'm going to do.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I see you as a child.  I see you young.  You're with all the other children.  You're playing.  You get along with them, but somehow you feel alone.  Somehow you feel separate.  You're working hard.  You're working very hard.  You're trying to get along with them and get all your studies done.  But there's a part of you that's holding back.  You feel you could be better.  Oh, my God.  You're strong.  You're very strong.  You're very strong emotionally. 
[02:47:00]  But there's a weakness somewhere in your heart that you sometimes feel.  In your career, you've been very, very ambitious.  You've been very successful.  But sometimes you worry not as successful as you could be.  You're a very tall man who's also kind of short.  You're fat, but you're also thin.  You're smart, but you're also stupid.  Everything you say, just take it back.  Everybody, no one says, everything I've done has been 100% successful.  Every person.  You've been in love a few times.  Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. 
[02:47:30]  The love of your life may have gotten away,  but you still feel a tenderness that has been fulfilled.  Yes, I do.  Oh, my God.  So they're basically fishing, and they watch what you grab for.  No, I haven't even done the fishing yet.  Oh, you haven't.  All I've done is do it and take it back.  Also, the other trick, which is horrible,  is just say what you'd like to believe about yourself.  Because the reason poetry works, the reason the show works,  is because people have a lot of similarities.  When Bob Dylan sings, 
[02:48:00]  I married Isis on the fifth day of May,  but I could not hold on to her very long.  So I got on my pony, and I rode straight away.  Nothing happened to you on those dates.  You didn't get on a pony.  But there's something emotional that means something to you,  and you hold on to it.  It is a perversion of poetry.  Everyone has shortcomings that they know about.  And if you talk about that, like,  oh, you feel like you could do better.  Everyone feels they could be in a better situation than they're in.  Always, no matter who you are.  Then there are other great tricks. 
[02:48:30]  There are five people in your family.  There's five people in everyone's family.  Because if it's just you're an only child,  it's you, your mother, your father,  your grandparents were pretty close to you.  If you have four brothers and sisters,  there's five children in your family.  If you have three, you know,  if you have two brothers and sisters,  and your mother and father,  how does that work?  Seven siblings, you're only close to about five of them.  You're really, you know,  you can always, you can always alibi. 
[02:49:00]  In your head, you're like, okay.  Always alibi.  Then if you hear these people,  you always want to never,  ever trust what they,  what you remember.  Because in the,  as Randy's fond of saying,  you don't say,  I woke up last night at three in the morning in a cold sweat,  and nothing else happened and I went back to bed.  That's not a memory.  You have to have something important to remember it.  That's the way our mind focuses on stuff.  So what these people will also do 
[02:49:30]  is they'll throw out a zillion things  and they'll just watch your face.  Now remember,  nobody is trying to test them.  They already believe it.  Right.  So when they're talking,  people will go,  and I've watched videotapes of people that say,  they told me this stuff and I said nothing.  I think the people are going,  yeah,  they're nodding their head.  Yeah,  yeah.  Shaking their heads.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yes,  yes,  yes.  So I see you have a,  your,  your,  your,  your,  your,  your wife is a blonde,  yeah, 
[02:50:00]  red,  red,  yeah,  red head.  And they work their way down on that.  And then they get lucky on a few things  and that's what the people,  and they'll always tell the people,  I want you to remember this and be able to check it.  So write this down.  Then when they hit something,  they say,  write it down.  What you want to hear,  is a tape recording of those actual things  that's not edited.  And then it is hysterical.  Because they told you,  you were married to people with eight different names.  They told you your grandparents were alive and dead. 
[02:50:30]  They told you your parents died young and died old.  And you know,  they'll always say,  when they're,  you know that someone,  someone comes to you,  it's a time of crisis.  That means someone died.  It's a divorce or it's financial.  Yeah.  You already know that  or they wouldn't fucking be there.  You don't just on a whim decide to go and get some type of reading.  Now this is all stuff that's just called cold.  Uh-huh.  That stuff,  if you just walk in and I know nothing.  Right.  There's another thing that's a little bit depressing, 
[02:51:00]  which is we don't really listen to each other.  You know,  when you talk to somebody,  you're always,  especially for us,  thinking about what you're going to say next,  where you're going to go,  where you're going to go.  If you just sit with someone,  next time you're on a plane with a stranger,  uh,  try this experiment.  Don't give any thought to what you're going to say or what you want to tell about yourself,  but just say to yourself,  I'm going to get all the information I can from this person as quickly as possible. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  And then you look at their hands.  How much does the watch cost?  What rings are they wearing?  What kind of clothes are they wearing?  Where are they looking?  What are their glasses?  What kind of iPad do they have?  What's on it?  You know,  go through that whole thing and then just say,  you know,  how are you doing?  And then say,  what accent do they have?  You know,  what music do you have with your iPod?  And you'll find,  if you don't think about yourself at all,  you just think about the other person,  they tell you everything.  You could get a pretty good line on who they are.  All of this is for cold readings.  That's just someone that walks in, 
[02:52:00]  you know nothing about them.  Now we'll go to hot readings,  which means someone tells you,  my friend Anthony is really interested in talking to a psychic.  He's going to come in next week.  I gave him your number.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Yeah.  Then...  A little Google,  a little...  Well,  you don't even need that.  If you know you have a whale,  if that cat's got money,  then you can afford a private investigator.  Oh,  shit.  Now,  if you move to another town, 
[02:52:30]  okay,  so you've been going to one psychic,  okay,  and now you're going to move to Atlanta,  and you tell your psychic,  I can't go anymore to you  because I'm moving to Atlanta.  Do you know a psychic down there?  Oh,  my God.  They say,  sure I do.  Here's the name of a couple of them.  They get on the phone,  and they send your file  and your tapes.  And if you've been going to that psychic  for a year,  they have reams of information on you.  You go into Atlanta,  you walk in, 
[02:53:00]  and then you tell all your friends,  the psychic never met me before,  never even knew my name.  I walked in.  Yeah,  yeah.  Wow.  You know,  and that's just...  And then you do it on TV,  and you can edit out,  you know,  you can shoot three hours,  and then edit it down to nothing.  And why do they get a pass?  Because their skill or whatever,  their power is vague.  They get these vague...  Yeah,  I see a Julie or a John or a Jenny.  But why do they get a pass on that?  If you have this skill, 
[02:53:30]  why would it be crystal clear  what you're seeing?  Well,  also,  I know for a fact...  I mean,  we know why,  but why do they get a pass on that?  Yeah,  they do.  I heard this.  If you want to hear a case of someone  ad-libbing really badly,  John Edward.  I heard this story from a...  This is a second-hand story.  I wasn't actually there.  John Edward did one of his shows  in Atlantic City.  Now,  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  Remember that.  And he is on stage  in front of all these people. 
[02:54:00]  And he says,  in Atlantic City,  does Greece mean anything to anyone?  Greece.  I'm thinking Greece.  Okay?  Now,  big Greek population  in Jersey.  Pretty safe  when you've got an audience  of a thousand people  that someone  has something to do with Greece  and their ancestry.  and a woman  raises her hand  and says,  my mother just passed away  and she loved that movie.  Oh,  shit.  She loved that movie. 
[02:54:30]  Oh,  man.  And the guy is such a dipshit,  he says,  I meant the country.  Why wouldn't he just go with it?  You would think.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Because there aren't even smart.  I mean,  if you guys turned into this,  it would be,  it would be just.  And I saw what you said there.  You didn't say fraud,  you said dipshit.  See,  I learned.  I learned,  Angela.  I learned.  We got to get Chris Tucker in here.  You want to hang?  Yeah,  hang with us.  He's only here for 10 minutes  because he has to be out by 940. 
[02:55:00]  Oh,  is that it?  No,  no,  this is fascinating.  Love it.  Hey,  Chris,  how are you,  buddy?  How you doing,  man?  How are you?  Oh,  Penn?  You want to take my mic here?  No,  no,  just say,  hey,  Chris,  what's up?  I'm going to move over once.  Oh,  it's like the Carson show.  Yeah,  sorry to keep you waiting.  We're down at the couch.  We're overbooked today.  I apologize.  no problem.  Penn is one of our pals  and just amazing to listen to.  My God.  I'll step over to the side here.  They're telling us you only have until 940.  Yeah,  we didn't know that. 
[02:55:30]  We thought you had a little longer than that.  You're very busy.  Busy man.  We're talking about psychic stuff.  Penn is really,  really big on not necessarily believing that.  I don't know how I feel about it.  Are you a believer or not?  I went to a psychic  and she wouldn't read me  because she knew I wasn't going to pay her.  She said,  you're not going to pay me.  Get out of here.  I said,  you must be real.  You're good.  You are good.  Do you buy that stuff or no?  No,  I don't.  Nah,  good for you.  She's going to tell me something I don't want to hear.  You're going to get hit by a car. 
[02:56:00]  What?  Where?  Where?  I don't know.  Yeah,  don't be vague when it comes to  you're like hit by a car or a meteor.  They're all dipshits.  There you go.  You know,  I had a woman I was arguing with about it  and she said,  because she was like,  no,  I talked to my father.  They told him,  it's like you can't,  it's such an emotional thing for people.  You don't want to say,  no,  your father didn't communicate with you from the dead.  It's heartbreaking.  But you remember when someone dies that you loved,  all you have of them is the memories.  The most valuable thing I have in my life is my memories of my mom,  my dad,  and my sister who are all dead. 
[02:56:30]  These people think they're giving comfort,  but in reality,  they're distorting the memories of the people I love the most.  And that,  I don't care about them stealing the money nearly as much as I care about them stealing and altering the memories in people's minds.  Because,  you know,  your mother had this exact personality that you loved and now she comes back from the dead and says,  you know,  Houdini is the famous one.  After Houdini's mother died,  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,  who wrote the Sherlock Holmes thing,  who was a big believer, 
[02:57:00]  brought him to a psychic who communicated with his mother.  Actually,  Arthur Conan Doyle's wife did automatic writing.  She got a letter from beyond from Houdini's mother,  which said,  dear Harry,  now,  his mother never called him Harry because it wasn't his name.  It was Eric.  His mother didn't speak English.  His mother was,  he was born in Budapest.  He got Rosetta Stone up there.  There was a cross on the top and his father was a rabbi. 
[02:57:30]  So,  you know,  in every one of those first few things,  there's that distortion.  So that's what troubles me.  So the name was wrong,  the religion was wrong,  and the language was wrong.  0 for 3.  Right.  0 for 3.  So we saw you,  you kind of came into kind of a crazy,  crazy show.  That's good.  Now,  what do you got going on now?  You're a movie,  right?  Yeah,  I'm in this movie,  A Silver Line and Playbook with Bradley Cooper,  Robert De Niro,  Jennifer Lawrence,  and it's a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.  And Bradley Cooper's character is in this mental patient and dealing with bipolar. 
[02:58:00]  My character is the mental patient too.  We meet in this institution and become friends,  I guess.  And then he gets out,  try to rebuild his life.  I get out and I just show up throughout the movie,  man.  And it's pretty fun.  Pretty fun character.  Did you stop doing films for a while or stand up?  Because I've seen you at the comedy cellar a few times.  It's like,  are you doing sets again?  Someone said that he got very religious and he just didn't want to perform anymore.  Is that true or is that not true?  I took a break from time to time,  but I've been doing stand up for the last seven years.  I went back to the comedy clubs and I've been touring for the last two years across the country. 
[02:58:30]  And I just filmed my stand up comedy movie like Eddie Murphy's Raw or Richard Pryor Live in Long Beach coming out early next year.  Filmed it in my hometown in Atlanta at the Fox Theater.  What made you stop doing films?  Because you were doing really well.  You know what?  I'm real picky.  A lot of the stuff was the same stuff coming in.  So I said, let me just take a break and then, you know, something like this, you know,  a silver lining playbook with a great director, David O. Russell, and a great cast.  You know, I like stuff like that.  You know, even if I'm not the main star in the movie,  I like to be a part of something good and it's making good noise out there. 
[02:59:00]  But it wasn't like you objected over the content or the language or any of that stuff?  No, no.  It's, you know, I always had a plan about what I would do in my career and what direction I'd take.  But, you know, no, it wasn't that, no.  Just, you know, I just wasn't interested in some stuff.  Hmm.  Yeah.  You were in quite a few movies that made a lot of money.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That Rush Hour stuff, absolutely.  Did all right, huh?  Probably put a few roofs over your head.  Jackie Chan's a close friend of mine. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  Any hundred million dollar movie guy you want to stay close to, no reason to fuck that relationship.  I want him to stay healthy.  Was it that kind of stuff, though, that you were being approached to just continuously do that type of character?  Sometimes, some of it was, some of it was, and I was looking for something different.  But, yeah, something, you know, action, cop movie.  And I was like, you know, we did it so well in Russia.  I was like, leave it alone.  Let's do something else.  So is this new movie more of a dramatic thing, or is it a comedy?  Yeah, it's dramatic. 
[03:00:00]  It's dramatic, and it's real interesting.  I was saying that the timing of it is great, you know, because it's dealing with mental illness.  And I think everybody got a little something, you know, because we all need balance in life.  And so it's a great movie, great movie to explain that, and just about a family, dealing with family issues.  Bradley Cooper's character is bipolar.  His daddy has Robert De Niro, played by Robert De Niro, is OCD.  He's, his vice is gambling on games because he lost his job and lost his pension.  And his mother is right there trying to hold a family together. 
[03:00:30]  And my character, you know, shows up out of nowhere all the time.  And then Jennifer Lawrence from The Hunger Games, a great new actress, her character has an addiction, a sexual addiction,  because her husband died, and, you know, a whole story about that.  So it's a pretty good one.  Do you got any of that stuff?  Do you have any of that stuff?  I mean, comics are always messed up on some level.  I just want to say that OCD, those letters should be in alphabetical order.  It should be CDO.  Yeah, it should.  Good observation there. 
[03:01:00]  Absolutely.  Do you have any of that stuff?  I mean, as a comic, I'm addicted to sex.  I'm addicted to everything I touch, I can't stop doing.  It's like, we're all fucked up.  I don't.  Actually, you know, you got to fight it.  You got to fight it to be strong, so that's how you survive.  Oh, I did, but I lost.  I mean, I fought hard, but I just seemed to lose a lot.  Every comic I know, yeah, there's something just a little off about you guys.  You know who I can't figure out?  Seinfeld.  I don't know him that well, but I've never seen Seinfeld do anything particularly unhealthy. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, it's got to be really strange.  There's got to be something.  There's got to be something.  Human sacrifice in his basement.  Something so over-the-top bad.  He invites Jehovah's Witnesses in and decapitates him.  Although that would be a public service.  Oh, my God.  But it's like, I can't find any chink in his armor.  There's got to be, like, every comic has a problem or some type of addiction.  What about Steve Martin?  Steve Martin?  Smart.  Polite.  Kind.  But he's probably, from what I know about Steve Martin, he's a big art collector. 
[03:02:00]  So, for him, it may be a bit of that, of some type of a hoarding or a spending.  I don't know him more.  You're going to say that art collecting is some sort of mental illness?  No, no, no, no, no.  But I'm saying if he does that to an extreme, because I hear he's like a real...  He knows art, yeah.  Yeah, if you do that to an extreme, it could be like collecting baseball cards.  I don't know.  Do you think the comics are different than guys that work at McDonald's, or is there  that much...  I think that very few jobs have as many of one personality type in them.  Like, you know, you find a lot of type A personalities are fucking quarterbacks or whatever. 
[03:02:30]  Like, that's what I'm saying.  Like, every comic I know...  And most jobs aren't made because you're insecure.  Comedians are comedians basically because we're insecure, fucked up, disasters.  I also think, like, some guy just working a normal 9-to-5 job doesn't open himself up  like a comic does.  So a comic is more exposed to people going, wow, he's fucked up, as opposed to the guy  just working at a store.  You know, you're willing to tell people how screwed you are for a few chuckles.  Yeah, but you also focus on your sickness.  Well, yeah, but it's good fodder for jokes. 
[03:03:00]  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's not healthy to think about yourself all the time.  No, it's not good.  I mean, in order to think about everything everybody else is doing and analyze why they're doing it.  Are you content to, like...  And this goes to both of you guys.  Are you content with your own thoughts?  Like, does thinking, being alone thinking, trouble you?  Because I need the TV on constantly.  I can't be left to my own devices.  Here's the question.  Were any of you also molested, like Anthony probably was? 
[03:03:30]  Anthony, what's a thought that troubles you?  You've never really explained it.  Like, I like relaxing, but like just abstract thoughts of...  But it actually bothers you?  It freaks you out?  No, not freaks me out as much as it's just exhausting to go through...  Wow, you might have an OCD thing.  CDO.  CDO.  No, just thinking about, like, you know, the universe and...  Wow!  Wow!  You know, it's just your mind's constantly going. 
[03:04:00]  That's exactly what Stephen Hawking would be like if he could move.  Exactly.  Just having the honeymooners on in the background so he didn't have to think of his alcoholic father.  Yeah, but why is it troubling?  We all have that.  Our brains are always doing something.  You know when you say you can't sleep at night and stuff?  There's a reason you can't, right?  Well, this is the reason I wouldn't be able to say...  If I leave the TV on, it's nice.  I got something going in the background.  I like that.  Everybody just ignored the fact that when Opie had to describe what was going on in his head, 
[03:04:30]  he said, stuff.  You know, the point is, you know, all that thought.  Stuff.  But you didn't need any detail.  Our brains are always working, is what I'm saying.  They're always thinking stuff.  Chris Tucker knows what I'm saying.  He's always thinking stuff.  It's just constantly...  No, but it's troubling to him.  That's the word I keep picking on.  It's not as troubling.  I don't want to get this misconception that it's so troubling.  It's just sometimes you just don't want to think so much. 
[03:05:00]  You just want to...  Like when you think ignorance is bliss, it is kind of like you look and go,  I bet that guy doesn't think about anything.  I bet it's so nice and easy to just fall asleep in a quiet room.  And he glanced over at Opie.  I bet that guy doesn't think about anything.  He's just thinking stuff.  Stuff.  Things.  Well, yeah.  Is anybody else like that?  I can't watch TV.  I have to be total pitch black silence when I sleep.  It's got to be completely silent.  I like the whole world to be shut off when I'm laying down. 
[03:05:30]  No outside noise.  My wife comes in the door with just a key.  It'll wake me up.  And she knows she's got to be quiet.  It's brutal.  I'm the lightest sleeper ever.  I like the TV sometimes.  Do you?  Yeah, last night I fell asleep at the TV on.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like that.  Sometimes they take care of the subconscious.  I like when it influences dreams sometimes.  Oh, boy.  It kind of gets a little weird in there.  Dreams are great.  I woke up one time.  It's like a pisser.  You could be in all kinds of trouble.  The police and this and that.  And then you wake up and go, I'm out of trouble. 
[03:06:00]  This is great.  That was easy.  Piece of cake.  And then you wake up and you realize you're in more trouble than you were in the dream.  Like, wow, I didn't dream that I was file trading with Gary Glitter.  But I guess that's reality.  You ever fall asleep and wake up and one of your own films is on?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Do you watch it if it's on?  Like, I won't watch something.  I've been in so few things, but I can't.  I won't watch it.  Yeah, the odds of it are so astronomical.  I watch Fifth Element all the time.  I watch the first rush hour. 
[03:06:30]  All the time.  What about the second one?  Oh, I watch the second one, too.  The second one.  The third one I watch, so-so.  You've seen it.  He'd rather just view his bank account on his phone.  I don't watch anything with me in it and don't read any of my name in it, ever.  Do you watch the bullshits, though, when you're editing them, or no?  Never seen one of them.  Come on.  Why, though?  I just, I've done with that.  I have no interest.  Anything I find, I can't fix.  I love the writing.  I love the performing.  Are you part of the editing process?  Teller does.  Teller does that.  If there's a real question for me, and they have to bring me in, I will. 
[03:07:00]  So, but there's no memorabilia of Penn and Teller around my house.  There's no, you know, my children, they love the show we did on Discovery called Tell a Lie.  Right, yeah.  And they love that show, and if they're watching it, they know when Daddy comes in, they turn it off.  Go watch something else.  Watch porno or something.  So you don't want to collect any of your stuff?  Well, no, there is a collection for archival purposes, but not for me to watch. 
[03:07:30]  I'm always amazed, you know, there's some musicians that I know, that you go over to their house and they're playing their records.  What?  Yeah, I know, I've met musicians who you go to visit them, and they're just listening to one of their own records.  Come on, give us one name.  I'm not going to give you the name.  Clapton?  I will be beaten senseless.  Beaten senseless.  Courtney Love.  Wow, I can't do it either.  I can't watch myself.  I watch myself to edit.  Most people can't watch music in the general public.  That is true.  That's one thing I have in common with them. 
[03:08:00]  I find me repulsive and boring.  But could you sit down with a group of people and watch your own stand-up or movies comfortably?  Like, if you have to do it, you have to do it.  But can you sit there and watch?  Yeah, if I'm working at something and they want to see it, yeah, I'll love it.  Because I can get some work in, and then they're watching it, and it makes it more easier to me by myself.  Imagine liking what you do.  I cannot.  I literally can't comprehend.  I can't comprehend it.  Everything I do, I think, is an absolute hunk of shit. 
[03:08:30]  I pause for Anthony to answer something.  I will not say a word.  But I mean, I just can't watch it.  Because I think it's a dream of people, a fantasy, to have a movie, be in a movie, and  then go to the theater, sit in the back of the theater, just in an anonymous crowd, and  jack off.  And boom loudly.  What I do is, I actually, whenever I'm on screen, I'll actually just, I'll wear a funny hat,  and I'll just start an applause break every time I want it.  I love to still clap.  Yeah, this guy is fucking good. 
[03:09:00]  They're telling us you have to rap.  We only had a couple of minutes.  Yeah, we only had 15 minutes for Chris.  But the movie is Silver Linings Playbook with you and Bradley Cooper, and of course, De Niro.  And, you know, you've been in a million fucking big movies.  So, I mean, we're happy you came in.  I'm sorry.  Come back.  Yeah, come back when you have more time, man.  Thank you for sure.  I think it comes out Friday in New York and November 21st all across the country.  Okay.  I'll be seeing it.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, and also, I've got a stand-up comedy movie.  I talked about it.  What's it called?  It's good.  I think it's when I'm dating a return or something like that. 
[03:09:30]  First of the year, it'll be coming out.  Stand-up comedy movie.  Cool, cool, cool.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Nice.  Thanks so much, man.  Hey, Penn, you sticking around?  Thanks, Penn.  Thank you.  Okay, more Penn Jillette.  Stay there.  You don't want to do this, Opie?  No.  All right.  If you ask any girl, Opie.  I don't believe in fucking engagement rings.  It's the greatest gift a woman could ever get.  Oh.  You get credit for it all the time.  Anthony, you know about engagement rings, don't you?  Tell me about it.  Wow.  I'm not really sure.  Yeah, Ant doesn't believe in fucking engagement rings, either.  No, you guys, you have to know.  Penn, you know about engagement rings. 
[03:10:00]  Penn Jillette.  If you ask any girl, any woman, I prefer to say woman, what's the best gift she ever got, without  hesitation, but I've been thinking about it, she'll say her engagement ring.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring, not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she washes her hands, every time someone  at the store hands her change, you get credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day.  So it's got to be perfect. 
[03:10:30]  And Steven Singer gets that.  At Steven Singer Jewelers, they have the perfect system to make you get the perfect ring.  Steven Singer knows how important it is, and it's painless.

We just got word that Susan Boyle is walking by the studio. 
[03:11:30]  We've been nice to her over the years, right?  Yeah.  Very excited.  Susan Boyle and Jimmy's out there with the camera, and Roland said she won't take any pictures.  Well, if you look like her, would you?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You are really, uh...  Honest?  What the fuck?  What's wrong with honesty, Pent?  Tell him.  Right.  Does he betray his wife?  Of course he cheated. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, that's...  Holy fuck.  That situation.  Stop asking why would he?  You're not...  You said earlier, you're not very political.  You don't really delve into the political forum.  Oh, I'm very...  You know, I'm a libertarian.  I want...  I'm as far right as you can go on money and as far left as you can go on sex.  I want as much freedom as possible, and I want people to have as much responsibility  as possible.  That is fantastic.  That's exactly where I fit in.  Everybody pigeonholes me as a right-wing Republican kind of thing, but no, things like sex, gay 
[03:12:30]  marriage, abortion issues, I fucking do whatever you want.  Whatever you want.  Just don't make me pay for it.  Right.  Right.  I don't like being a partner 50-50 with the government.  Yeah.  I don't like that at all.  No, I don't...  Why aren't there more libertarians out there?  Well, I think if you run...  Too logical?  If you run a test, if you ask people questions, a huge majority comes out to be libertarian. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  But then they don't have the hype, you know.  It's amazing.  I mean, what makes me crazy, and I've carried on about this before, and I won't do a whole  thing about this, but our president is Obama.  Obama was a pothead, and even played around a little with some blow.  And he is now saying that states that have voted to make marijuana legal, the federal  government will come in and override them and put people in prison.  Does he honestly believe that if he had gone to prison for pot, he would have had a better 
[03:13:30]  life and done more for our country?  I don't think so.  And he goes on Jimmy Fallon, and he jokes about dope.  It's like a little joke.  Ha ha, you know, yeah, there's probably a pothead calling in.  People are doing years in prison for marijuana.  Now, I've never smoked marijuana in my life, never had a sip of alcohol.  But...  I never had a sip.  Steve Jobs smoked dope. 
[03:14:00]  Do we really think our country would be better off if Steve Jobs had been in prison?  I mean, do we really think that everybody that smokes...  Because if you have something illegal in your country, it means by definition you think  everyone who does that should be punished.  Everyone.  Right.  Do we honestly believe that everyone that smokes dope should be in prison?  Who would do anything?  We would have no one left in the country except me and Donald Trump.  That's who you would have, everybody else in prison. 
[03:14:30]  So why is the sentence so harsh?  Well, the sentence changes everywhere.  I mean, some places it's very, very mild.  But in a lot of places, it's pretty harsh.  Really harsh.  And it also costs us a lot of fucking money.  Why do you want to pay $75,000 a fucking year to keep a pothead in prison?  Screw it.  I could use that money for other stuff.  Absolutely.  Stuff.  What happened, Jimmy?  You're smiling way too...  She's coming down to the green room.  I'm just disgusted at myself.  Why? 
[03:15:00]  Because I'm standing...  I'm waiting for a photo with a monster.  See?  See?  You said it too.  Ah, you're terrible.  I'm a fucking creep.  Poor, nice woman is...  What does she look like in person?  I don't...  I'll let you know, but I don't have my hopes up.  Do people look better in person than on the TV?  Well, when you can't look worse.  Put it this way.  Put it this way.  That's not Roland.  Oh.  Hey, Penn, what about the book?  Seriously.  What about the book?  Yes.  Well, I don't even know what it's about.  Where are you going with this?  It says every day is an atheist holiday. 
[03:15:30]  Does it focus completely on your belief?  Did you read my other book?  Did you read the other book?  Yes, I did.  I liked it.  Very similar to that.  Just a collection of essays.  Oh, right on.  Just tied together about this.  Mostly about holidays and so on.  So it's a continuation.  Yeah, pretty much.  If you liked the other book, you will like this.  If you didn't like the other book, the chance of you liking this, very slim.  There's no major change up.  I read your stuff, Penn.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  No, but I really do...  Well, is the title going to throw people off, though?  Because I thought you were doing a book on atheism. 
[03:16:00]  For real.  Well, God Know was kind of a book on atheism, but there wasn't a lot of other stuff in there.  Because it's all your other stuff in there.  Same thing with this.  Same thing with this.  I just want to make sure people know that.  You know, it kind of started...  It started when I wanted to talk about it when I was on Pierce Morgan.  And Pierce Morgan started the show.  He hadn't read my book, but he started the show by saying,  I don't like you and I don't like your book.  Wow.  And then was trashing atheism.  And then at one point he said, which I thought was hitting a little bit below the belt,  he said, you know, your mother's dead. 
[03:16:30]  Are you happy with the fact that you'll never see her again?  Wow.  And then he also said...  How close did he get to punch her?  Aren't you afraid of being dead in the future?  And I said, 1909.  How scary is 1909 to you?  He said, what do you mean?  I said, you weren't here.  1909.  Does that frighten you?  Are you filled with chills at 1909?  21-09?  It's going to be the same for you.  You won't be here. 
[03:17:00]  And I said, 1909 happens to be the year my mom was born.  Because my mom was very old when I was born.  How old?  My mom was 45 when I was born.  And that was in 1955.  So that's tough.  And I just said, you know, that's not a scary time.  And I started thinking about how November 11th, 1909 meant a lot to me.  My mom's birthday.  And I started going through how all these holidays, like Easter and Christmas, 
[03:17:30]  are all these holidays of some sort of redemption for horrible things we've done.  And yet, in my mind, every single day has something beautiful and something to celebrate about.  And I wanted to really focus on that.  Because a lot of people ask me, you know, oh, you know, being an atheist, isn't it awful for your children?  And I say, no, the first day of the year, we do a big celebration.  And my children already know what all the Christian and Jewish kids have gotten as presents.  And all I've got to do is come over the top. 
[03:18:00]  It's just simple.  Oh, they got seven Skylanders?  Guess what?  Atheists get eight Skylanders.  That's the way we plan.  Oh, they got a pony?  You know something?  We get two ponies.  That's what we do on New Year's Day.  So it was just kind of a celebration of that.  And then I also, as I always do, you know that I always like to go off on tangents.  I tell some other stories.  One of my favorite stories in here is...  Did you get your picture?  Yeah, we got it.  Look how happy it is.  No, no, let's go with the picture. 
[03:18:30]  Chip got it.  How was it?  You got a picture of her and Chip?  Yeah.  Did you make the face?  Of course I did.  Oh, my God.  Wait, I don't know how to get to the image.  He has a face he makes with it?  Yeah, it's like Chip Chipperson.  Do people still care about her?  What is she doing?  That she's here.  What's that?  I don't know.  But I told her that my mother loved her and that she sings really good.  Oh.  She fucking hated me.  I bet.  She didn't say a word.  Oh, really?  You look probably frightening.  Did I see your picture?  Yeah.  Look at the fucking mug on her.  Go back to the cave.  Oh, did you?  Oh, but that's yours.  Depends like which one is you. 
[03:19:00]  That's never good.  Yeah, but she had a fucking mug on her.  She was not...  I'll play it later.  I taped it.  I audio taped it.  You did?  Yeah.  You audio taped the picture?  Yeah.  Just her and Chip talking.  It's really nice.  Penn, do you find that people's like...  When they talk like that, like Piers Morgan, talking about a fear like that, aren't you  afraid?  Isn't it really...  Doesn't it boil down to the fear that you are irrelevant and you will not be part of 
[03:19:30]  what happens in the future?  Who's our guest?  Anthony, you missed part of the conversation, Jimmy.  I missed part of the conversation, Jimmy.  All right.  What are you doing?  I said, make believe you're Jim Norton.  Oh, it's funny you walked in the middle of that.  I have no idea what we're talking about.  Einstein said, you know, it all comes down to if you believe the tree is still there  when you look away.  Hmm.  Okay.  That is really, to me, the difference between, you know, religion tends to be, and there's 
[03:20:00]  obviously exceptions to this, it tends to be completely self-centered.  I believe this and therefore it's true.  The atheist point of view just is there's a world out there without me.  I'm not in the center of it.  And it always makes me laugh so much when people say, you know, atheists are so arrogant.  And I always go, yeah, you know, we aren't humble like someone who thinks that there is  an omniscient, omnipresent God watching over them all the time, going perfect for them, 
[03:20:30]  and cares desperately when they masturbate.  We are so arrogant, we think that we're living our own lives and love the people around us  and do the best we can, and the universe is not all looking at us for every little  move we make, and we won't live on forever at the right hand of an omnipresent being.  That's the kind of arrogant pricks we are.  We think we have to work hard for what we do and not just drop to our knees and pray. 
[03:21:00]  Not that dropping to your knees is not hard work, Jim.  It certainly is.  We know what you do for your career.  Absolutely.  Especially when that young lady has a dress and a good ball.  What am I, rude?  It really is amazing that people need, they need that.  You know, I don't know if they do.  People always say that.  Don't you think it's...  Did you see the latest numbers?  The number of people that said they were non-religious, as recently as the end of the last century, 
[03:21:30]  you know, 1998-99, the numbers were hovering around 1%.  People that said they had no religion, 2%, 3%, way down there.  The latest polls, and not like a nut poll, you know, not like my poll, but like, you know,  a CNN major poll, 20%, 22%, 23%, no religion.  If you go to under 30, it goes to 30% no religion.  If you called atheism a religion, which is like calling not collecting stamps a hobby, 
[03:22:00]  if you were to call it that, it is the fastest growing religion in American history.  I mean, that whole...  What does that attribute it to?  Would you say?  Well, I say, very sadly, I think a lot of it had to do with 9-11.  I was going to...  9-11 was a faith-based initiative.  9-11 was people who, and I want to say this carefully so I'm not misunderstood,  but the terrorists, the criminals, the sick people who did that, 
[03:22:30]  I think may have sincerely believed that what they were doing was right.  Was right.  And that is the biggest horror.  That is a much bigger horror than Charlie Manson.  You know, Charlie Manson knew what he was doing was wrong.  The fact that that kind of...  And the amount of...  The 3,000 people who died is the biggest tragedy in American history, on American soil.  But on top of that, the people who continue to die because of those religious fanatics. 
[03:23:00]  And I think a lot of people who were, before that, closeted atheists or closeted non-believers.  Atheist is a word that scares people, but just didn't have religion.  We're finally willing to say, no.  I just, I know that a lot of my friends just said, I will not allow someone in my presence  to talk about religion without saying, I don't believe in that, because we've got to stop  crazy shit like this from happening. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Don't you think science has something to do with it, too?  Like, as science becomes more...  Like, people have always needed something.  Like, we were just fucking chimps.  It was the sun.  It's always something higher than us.  And I've heard...  When you say when we were chimps, you mean the people in this room, not humanity.  Oh, no, no, yes.  I mean, actually, the four of us.  I'm talking about...  I remember that kind of vaguely.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't chimp.  It was just throwing shit at each other to be silly.  But they called us chimps, and we accepted it.  Where are most atheists coming from? 
[03:24:00]  Like, do Muslims become atheists?  Well, you know, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the wonderful writer who went from being Muslim to atheist  and has a fatwa on her ass still.  I mean, she's as bad off as Salman Rushdie.  And, you know, sometimes I get, you know, emails from Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  We write back and forth through anonymous mailers and all of this.  And she'll say, you know, maybe if I get to Vegas, I'd love to come meet you. 
[03:24:30]  And I kind of go, well, you know, I support you completely in what you're doing.  We can Skype.  Maybe I don't want to have lunch.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's Skype.  Let's Skype.  But are Muslims turning to atheism as well?  Well, you know, not as quickly as we'd like.  That's what I'm thinking.  It's more of a...  That's that.  But, you know, what we're finding is, you know, the U.S. has always been one of the  most religious countries on the planet.  And that is kind of going away.  You know, you've got the extremists. 
[03:25:00]  The fanatics are still there.  But a lot of what would have been called liberal Christians and liberal Jews are now calling  themselves non-religious.  And it's, you know, what I...  I was doing a lot of work for charity stuff, and someone asked me, why do you do all this  charity work?  And I said, I'm doing God's work because God isn't going to.  That's great.  That should be on a poster.  We really have to help each other. 
[03:25:30]  Without any...  We're all we have.  Now, without any...  But you can totally spin that.  Without any of this spiritual repercussions that religion drills into your head, why do  you do nice things?  Why do anything?  Well, the question you're asking is the positive version of a question that I get asked pretty  often, which is, if there's no God, what's stopping you from raping and killing anyone  you want to?  Nothing.  And my answer is nothing.  I have raped and killed everyone I want to, and that number is zero. 
[03:26:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What is your list?  How many people are you going to kill?  How many people do you want to rape?  Because really, if my wife just kind of says, I'm tired, I'm automatically turned off, let  alone rape, I'm not pulling out a gun or a knife.  So they say, what's stopping you?  And I go, what's making you want to?  You fucking sick fuck.  Here's my list of everyone I want to rape.  Right here.  There it is.  Blank paper.  Here's my list. 
[03:26:30]  Here's my list of everyone I want to kill.  Yeah, it's another blank paper.  That's it.  I don't have a fucking list.  And these people at a book signing will raise their hand and say, you want, I'm saying,  could you please have security around that guy?  Because we're in a bad position now.  He has a list.  And if I convince him the correct truth that there's no God, maybe he'll go down his fucking  list.  Maybe he should stay religious.  But the thing is that the reason we help each other is because helping other people  is the reason we're fucking alive. 
[03:27:00]  It's the reason in our hearts that matters.  It's the best feeling you can get.  It's another reason that I'm a libertarian.  When I give money and a lot of money or a lot of help or a lot of time to charity,  I feel better than almost anything else I do in my life.  When the government puts a gun to my head and says, we're going to take this money from  you and use it to help people, I feel like shit.  Because first of all, I want to show that I'll really do that on my own. 
[03:27:30]  And second of all, I don't like a fucking gun to my head.  And third of all, I don't trust those motherfuckers to get the money where it belongs.  They can't even run the fucking post office.  FedEx whips their fucking ass.  What makes them think they're the ones who can deliver food to AIDS patients?  I can do a better job of my own.  They got a skim going on in the government.  They absolutely are taking so much money to do anything.  I didn't fuck up the post office.  Look at Kickstarter.  Okay?  Yeah, nice.  The National Endowment for the Arts, the NEA, you know, the money they get from the government, 
[03:28:00]  they turn about, I forgot the exact number, but it's somewhere around 80% of that money  ends up going to the artists.  That's pretty good.  Kickstarter, 99% of the money.  And they've done more funding, and people have chosen it.  People have chosen it.  Hey, that looks like a cool movie.  I'll give these guys 50 bucks to make their movie.  What could be more beautiful than that?  You know, with Kickstarter and PayPal and Twitter, fuck the government. 
[03:28:30]  We don't need them.  We're done.  We got it covered.  And with all the people giving from their hearts and helping people and giving charity,  we don't need God.  We can take care of each other.  But the government has, again, that gun that they do put to your head.  The gun's a big thing.  So they force you to do that.  That's a great way to put it.  With atheism, I'm not sure if it's true or not.  And I don't think, as you said, atheism has been a part of American history long enough.  But do you think that given time and enough people doing this, 
[03:29:00]  that there is almost this feeling of hopelessness, nothing to work towards except death  that would kind of bring everyone down in a way like...  There's nothing to work for except life.  It's religion that's this death cult.  It's religion that says, after we're dead, we get everything.  Atheism is the celebration of life.  It's a celebration of people.  It's a celebration of hearts.  It's the most beautiful thing in the world.  And with all due respect, you're wrong. 
[03:29:30]  In the end of the late 19th century, the three most popular speakers, the superstars on the  Chautauqua circuit, the speakers were Robert Ingersoll, atheist.  Mark Twain, atheist, both speaking about atheism, and Huxley talking about evolution.  It was very, very popular.  And Ingersoll, the great atheist of that time, was invited to the White House because at that 
[03:30:00]  time you didn't use the word Christian as much.  You used each little sect.  You know, so there was the Southern Baptist against Dave's Baptists, against Bill's Bateshop  and Baptists, who all were afraid that if someone got into power, they'd force their  religion.  So having an atheist on your side looked really good.  Then the socialists came in, adopted atheism, and fucked everything up.  I want to ask you about libertarian, too, because I like the libertarians a lot.  I like what they believe. 
[03:30:30]  They lost me on one point, though.  Like, John Stallion, a butt man, was a huge libertarian.  Yeah, I sure he is.  And, you know, when he was being targeted, and it was costing him like $2 million in legal  fees, and they were trying to ruin him, libertarians, he said, walked away from him, and nobody  like, stuck up for him.  And that's...  I know porn's a tough one for any political party.  I stuck up for him.  No, no, no, you, but not the party.  You know, my good friend, Bob Korn Revere, was part of his legal team, and I helped put  that together.  Not necessarily personal guys, like guys that are like... 
[03:31:00]  Give me the libertarian party.  As a whole, they didn't stand up and say, like, this is...  You're targeting this guy, and this is a personal freedom.  They don't speak out as much as they should about that.  But I...  You know, once again, a libertarian is not one block.  It's a bunch of individuals.  And my feeling on freedom of speech, including Fred Phelps and all those crazy people picketing,  I'm a total freedom of speech guy.  I think the answer...  You have to be.  You absolutely have to be.  The answer to bad speech is more speech.  Right.  It's always more speech. 
[03:31:30]  The worst stuff people say, just say more.  The thought that people actually want to shut people up and stop them from saying something  because they're offended by it is so just pompous.  It's like, you don't think the stuff you're saying annoys people?  Also so dangerous.  Yes.  Keeping that stuff in a pressure cooker is just insane.  You know, we don't want the American Nazi Party underground.  We want those assholes talking where we can see them, you know?  I'm on here every day from 6 to 10. 
[03:32:00]  But it's really an important thing.  I mean, I think, I mean, I feel less comfortable with somebody with their finger on the button  to cause war that believes in a peaceful life after death than someone who believes that  this is all we've got.  And it's over.  This is all we've got at the end and that all we have is love in each other.  I mean, I don't know this whole idea that not believing in God leads to depression seems 
[03:32:30]  to me insane.  You know, the glory of the life that we have now, the love that we have now, and the fact  that people who are suffering are not going to get something better down the line, we  better help them now.  Well, that's just it.  It almost seems like if you don't have an end game except for the end, if there isn't  somewhere, another step up, another level up, that everything you do seems futile. 
[03:33:00]  Not futile, beautiful.  I mean, it's, I don't know why, I don't know why you need more.  You know, you are the most amazing numerical aberration that ever, the fact that you are  here, the fact that you're living every day is astonishing to get you here.  You've won the lottery.  You've won the biggest fucking lottery that could ever be won in the universe, and then  you get up in the morning and look at the sunshine, and look at your friends and your 
[03:33:30]  family who love you, and you want fucking more?  Fuck you.  You greedy motherfucker.  But what about, and I agree with you, but what about the people who like have a kid and  the kid has cancer, and again, that's playing devil's advocate, where they have terrible  lives.  Like, you know, girls that are grown up abused and raped by a father, terrible, and for them  to realize this is all there is, sometimes, for some people, that may be the only thing  that keeps them going is, yeah, I had this child who died when they were four, but I'll 
[03:34:00]  see them again someday.  Good point.  As opposed to the ugliness of, this is all there is.  Well, did you tell Susan Boyle she was beautiful, gorgeous?  No, but I said that my mother loves you.  Yeah, there you go.  Chip said that to her.  My point is, yes, yes, there is bad stuff in the world, but that does not justify, does  not make something else true.  Right, of course.  It just means that we're responsible for helping.  You know, some of the charities I work with in Vegas, like Opportunity Village, work for 
[03:34:30]  people with intellectual disabilities, and tries to get them back into the workplace.  Some of those people have rather bad lives, and there's a bunch of really good people  trying to make those lives better.  And yes, I don't think that you can make the judgment, this other person would be happier  if I lied to them.  No, no, no, I don't mean that.  I think that is so condescending.  What I mean is I understand why they feel, because we're saying like...  It gives them some hope.  I could see what that means to somebody. 
[03:35:00]  I'm not saying we should tell them it's true, but I get why they would say, I think there's  something after this that's better, because what's here is absolutely terrible.  And if you're helping, it's a good place to be.  But if you're the person who needs the help, it's not as easy to reconcile that.  If you believe in that, what's the wrong with that, is what you're saying.  No, I just see why they want when I have it.  Yeah, yeah.  What they're wrong with that is, is 9-11.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what's wrong with that.  What's wrong with that is the idea that people can believe what they want without fact-checking 
[03:35:30]  with the rest of the world.  Means if you let, if you let the person there, what harm are they doing to believe something  that's not true?  You have to.  If you will condone that faith, you have to condone Charlie Manson.  And you have to condone the terrorists.  Because all they've got to do is prove to you that they have that faith in their heart  and it helps them, then they can do whatever they want.  No.  The truth does matter.  The truth really does sincerely matter.  None of us have it.  We have no idea what it is. 
[03:36:00]  All of us are wrong on everything all the time.  But let's not give up on trying to get better.  But the behaviors, I agree with you, the behaviors of religious people, fanatics, are reprehensible.  I'm not talking about doing anything.  But it all starts with condoning the faith.  When you say, well, you know, it's okay to believe that, what harm does it do?  We have to say, you know, it might not be true.  You need to look at this a little more because you might be stopping someone who's on their  way to fanaticism.  Also, you need to respect people enough to tell them the truth as you see it. 
[03:36:30]  I don't know if that's my place to do that, though.  No, it's not your place to tell them they're wrong, but it is your place to tell them what  you believe and what you know.  But do you have an absolute proof that it is not true?  No, you can't.  You can't.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you can on the way say, you know, that's not the way I see it.  What I am arguing with is very simply smiling and nodding.  That's all I'm arguing with.  Right.  I'm very happy with going, you know, I can see why you see that, but here's why I don't. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  Just so we're getting the dialogue going.  It is an extension of freedom of speech.  So you're not completely convinced that there's no way you can know.  See, I'm glad you said that because we just don't have enough knowledge.  But like my dear friends, and I have a lot of them, who are evangelical or who are Mormons,  they believe that belief is active.  That you can't just say, I'm not sure it's not true, but you actually have to believe.  I do believe belief is active. 
[03:37:30]  I don't have, right now, and I might in a minute, I can't predict the future, I don't  right now have an active belief in God.  And therefore, if you ask me what I am, the answer is atheist.  I did not answer the question by saying, there is no God.  I answered the question by, right now, this second, Penn Jillette does not believe in God.  I'm relieved you said that.  Yeah.  No, it's very different.  We'll never have all the knowledge.  And we don't want it.  Right.  Then all the fun's gone.  Right, right, right.  But isn't it, it is possible that there's a scientific reason that we have that belief, 
[03:38:00]  which I think is going away as science proves more and more.  There absolutely is.  Our need for, like, and I raise Africa, people that are born into those fucking horrendous  living conditions where their clits are cut off, there's zero hope for them.  Well, no, no, no, no, but their clits are cut off because of the fucking religion.  But I mean those people, I know what you mean, but those people, biologically, there's  zero hope.  So for them to live accurately, there's zero hope.  But we can give them more hope by not fucking cutting their clits off.  Yeah, I understand that.  And we do that by saying, you know, the Muslim thing, a little dingy, might want to stop it. 
[03:38:30]  Stop cutting the clits off.  Be good thinking.  Thank you.  General mutilation, maybe you shouldn't be doing it until you're grown up and at a club  where it's done safely among adults.  But religion and its effect on this world through history has been so huge, there's no way of  stopping it.  I mean, it will go away eventually.  I don't think so.  It is going away wicked fast.  It just seems like this innate need that people have to believe in something greater 
[03:39:00]  than themselves.  I believe there is.  It's almost primitive.  I think it was called by somebody the transcendental seduction.  You know, you want to feel that.  Right.  But wanting something and having it be true are two different things.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I think you can feel.  Also, there are some people who will say that atheism doesn't have the awe and wonder of  the universe.  Well, atheism has nothing but awe and wonder of the universe.  When you say, how did the world get here? 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  That's big, wonderful, full of awe.  When you say, oh, God created in seven days, oh, all right.  And the nutty thing is, they talk about atheists not having, you know, imagination to accept  all this.  The creation myths that are created by, let's say, Christianity, the Garden of Eden, Adam  and Eve, my seven-year-old daughter can think that up.  Black holes, supernovas, that kind of shit. 
[03:40:00]  It takes G to string theory.  You know, the Hedron Collider, the Higgs boson, all that stuff is really hard shit.  The real stuff is so much weirder, so much cooler, so much crazier, so much deeper, so  much more beautiful.  And it's true.  You've got everything over on this side.  On this side, you've got Adam and Eve, 7,000 years ago, ate an apple, their sin, we're fucked  forever, we hate women, so long, good night. 
[03:40:30]  Over this side, you've got, we don't know, but on the way, we've got fucking black holes  and wormholes and the speed of light, and we've got shit, we can't, we've got wasps  that, you know, can look like other wasps.  We have octopuses that can change their color in order to communicate with other octopuses.  And by the way, octopuses is the plural, and not octopi.  Fuck you, I'm done.  One last question about it.  Are you scared to die? 
[03:41:00]  No, I don't want to, but I have no fear, and I answer again with...  How do you get to the place where you have no fear?  1909.  One last question.  1909.  1909.  How frightened are you in 1909?  I don't know.  You weren't here.  Yeah, but I'm scared to die like anyone else.  I know, but you weren't here in 1909, you won't be here in 2109.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah, it's exactly the same.  But you aren't afraid of all the past, why would you be afraid of the future?  You're not going to be here, you're not going to make a difference, but you might be remembered  a little bit by people who...  Because you think the world's just been waiting for me to be born. 
[03:41:30]  I know, and some omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent...  How dare you go on without me?  Omnipotent creature cares about nothing except you.  You don't have a beautiful sunset...  And the stuff you think.  Do you ever try to wrap your head around how many beautiful sunsets people will see way  after you're dead?  And they'll even get more beautiful because of the pollution makes the colors pop.  That was fascinating.  Yeah, it's just...  I think it's great.  It's a great take on things. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not a religious guy at all.  No.  Yeah.  I wouldn't consider myself an atheist because...  And you said it yourself, you don't know...  No, no, but you actively believe.  Do you pray?  No.  Do you actively believe?  No.  I'm sorry, but you're an atheist.  I'm sorry.  End of story.  It's done.  I hope, though...  I meditate.  I hope...  That's a whole different thing.  I meditate.  I mean, many, many atheists meditate.  I love meditation.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam Harris...  Isn't hope a sort of faith?  Isn't hope a sort of faith? 
[03:42:30]  I don't know.  I hope for things to go certain ways.  Sure, sure.  You don't actually actively...  Things that are beyond my control.  And the other thing is, with atheists, during sex, you talk to the person you're with instead  of God.  Isn't that a great idea?  I'll tell you, though.  If you don't remember her name, go religious right away.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You solves everything.  And that may be the creation of all religion.  Who wants to talk to the person you're fucking?  That's not fun.  I don't like to pretend they're anybody else.  Susan Boyle. 
[03:43:00]  Is she pretty?  Are these your people?  No.  Are they peeking in here?  What are they?  No, I know.  Are they my people peeking in here?  Is she pretty?  No, she's not.  Do they need them?  Is she really?  Is she shorter than I thought?  She's a tyrant.  This time, you know, I just said, every time I go on O&A, I just get talking to the guys.  I'm having a good time.  There's someone tugging on my dick to get out of here.  So this time, I said, you know, we'll start everybody else at Sirius after them.  Let me just have a little bit of time here.  The book signings, too.  I don't have them in front of me. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do the book signings.  I want to plug Penn.  Anthony, can I have that sheet?  I'll tell you.  I read God No, and I loved it.  So if it's a continuation, basically, I'm going to enjoy this one as well.  Penn Jillette, every day is an atheist day.  Every day is an atheist holiday.  Penn Jillette.  And people are liking it more.  It really thrilled me.  It thrilled me to pieces.  November 14th, I believe, is tonight.  It's 6 o'clock.  At Barnes & Noble on Warren Street here in the city.  Now, tomorrow night, if you're on the West Coast, Penn will be doing live talks, L.A. 
[03:44:00]  at Track 16, Santa Monica.  There's a talk and a signing both there.  You can go there.  You can meet Penn.  You can get your book signed.  And then looking ahead, if you're – I don't know where this is.  Oh, San Francisco.  Great city.  December 12th, 7 o'clock at the Book Passage.  What's that?  Corte Madera?  Corte Madera.  Corte Madera is a talk and a signing.  So, Penn's a great talker.  I'm all over the place.  It'll be very entertaining.  Yes, you are.  Thank you so much for having me on the big radio television program.  Yes, well, it does seem like television. 
[03:44:30]  Well, you get the lights and shit, don't you?  I know.  Yeah.  We just do –  We're getting ready for TV, slowly but surely.  Yeah, well, you know, Imus has a jib guy.  Yes, he does.  He's not kidding around.  Yeah, making some camera moves in that studio.  How's he doing?  He seemed good.  He seemed good.  We're pals with him.  Yeah, I don't –  We haven't seen him in a while, though.  I haven't gone on in a long while.  We mostly talked about, you know, Kinky Friedman and Ratso.  Oh, really?  We have Kinky and Ratso in common.  And, you know, nothing makes me happier in my life.  I mean, obviously, the birth of my children was important. 
[03:45:00]  But even better is having your phone ring, looking at it, and it says Ratso.  You know what I mean?  I always wanted to be a guy who would grow up and have a friend named Ratso.  Ratso, yeah.  Yeah.  He's trying to get you on the bus to go to Florida.  But I'm going to run along.  All right, Pat.  Thank you so much.  Always a pleasure.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure.  It was thought-provoking.  And, of course, Penn Jillette on the Twitter.  Yeah, his Twitter's great.  Definitely.  And also, don't forget Penn's Sunday School.  Which I like.  Yes.  I'm a little behind, I'll be honest.  But I really like your podcast. 
[03:45:30]  Certainly.  I like pretty much everything about Penn Jillette.  Penn, thanks so much, man.  All right.  Oliver Stone on the way.  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU Line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck yeah!  I just want to give Jimmy a big, hearty fuck you for it.  It's a kettlebell today.  Got this shit stuck in my head all the way to work and in the gym.  Fuck you. 
[03:46:00]  Fuck you!  I walked out of my house on Wednesday and a tree fell in my neighbor's house.  You know what I say?  You got a tree down in your house.  He said to go fuck myself.  So I told him to go fuck you.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big fuck you to all the dirty, smelly bitches at my work that refuse to wipe  their ass with toilet paper and use the toilet seat.  Fuck you, dirty bitches.  Fuck you!  Yeah, hi, this is Sal.  I just want to say fuck you to myself because I'm just too big of a bitch to get my ass 
[03:46:30]  to go to work when it's sprinkling outside.  My mommy told me it wouldn't be very safe, so unless I got her walking behind me to wipe  my ass, I'm just too afraid to do anything.  Fuck you, me.  Fuck you!  Fuck you, Louis C.K.  Hey, you've made it, brother.  I watched you on Saturday Night Live tonight.  You're fucking hilarious.  And sorry to hear that, Opie and Anthony.  You know what you're ever against.  You're gone.  Fuck you!  I want to give a fuck you to little Sammy Roberts.  Last time I checked, this is the Opie and Anthony show, not the Opie and Anthony and Sam 
[03:47:00]  Roberts show.  So shut your fucking mouth, you fucking douchebag.  Fuck you!  Open damn style!  Fuck you, Anarchy Radio!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I just wanted to listen to Jacktober, and now I have this stupid fucking dinosaur song  in my head all damn day.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Fuck me! 
[03:47:30]  All right, fuck you!  Take this out, you fucking hippopotamus!  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Let me see if this audio plays.  Where's Opie?  What?  He's gone. 
[03:48:00]  He had to go.  Yeah, he had to take a run.  He's got a thing to do.  He does.  He's got a thing.  A thing to do.  Okay.  La Familia stuff.  Oh!  Yeah.  He'll let you know.  Is he all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's all good.  I have, uh...  It's all good, man.  Hold on.  What do you say?  That's right.  Breaking bad, motherfucker.  Wait.  How do I play this?  Manfredi. 
[03:48:30]  Um, no.  Okay, I'm going to take this or something.  This is when Susan's coming up.  She's about to take photos in front of that series.  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  That might not be it.  Oh, it better be.  This is when you, um, took a picture with Susan Boyle.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I guess Jimmy put a recorder on.  Okay, I've got to get a picture of something.  Oh, there she's going.  Hi, Liam. 
[03:49:00]  How's it going?  Is Boyle coming?  She is, yeah.  Oh, hi.  Chip, how are you?  Oh, Chip.  That was her guy.  Chip just wanted to grab a photo with her, if that's okay.  Yeah.  Oh, she's my mother's favorite.  She's great.  Susan, would you mind taking a photo here with you?  Hi, how are you?  This is Chip.  It's so nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  You sing so good.  My mother loves you.  You're very wonderful.  Great.  We'll go right this way.  Thank you very much, Ms. Boyle. 
[03:49:30]  You're very welcome.  This thing's so lovely.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  She did not like Chip Chipperson.  Nothing to do with me.  Thank you.  It's a terrible compliment.  My mother loves you.  And the guy had to go, oh, that's wonderful.  That's wonderful.  She didn't even say that.  The only reason I didn't do a dumb Chip joke is because Leeds and the other guy brought  her over.  It's like, I don't ever want to do anything to make those guys look bad.  Like, assholes for bringing them over.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I don't want to get them.  Can I have some water?  Yeah.  That was Liam's voice, right? 
[03:50:00]  Some water for those guys.  Liam and Steve Leeds.  It's funny that Liam had to introduce you as Chip because it would have been much more  uncomfortable for him to have to say, wow, this is Jim.  But he just said he was Chip.  What's in there?  Liam's such a trooper.  What is that that's in there?  I saw E-Rock walk in with a big thing and plates and a fork.  You wanted to save this for the air.  Oh, cool.  This normally would be on the after show.  So please excuse us for the lack of quality of programming.  That's right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:50:30]  I'm not eating that.  What is it?  What is it?  This is a gift from Dr. Steve.  Oh, my God.  Why are you shaking?  He's nervous.  I'm being nervous.  He's around food.  When is stone coming in?  We don't want to eat this in all of our stone auction.  He's still got a wall.  It seems delicious.  What do you think it could possibly be?  Um, guess is around the room.  Is it a wheel of cheese?  It's shaped like a wheel of cheese.  Yes.  Is it, um.  Wheel of meats.  The handle of a, the steering wheel of a yacht? 
[03:51:00]  Um, is that an Asian lady's hat?  Everyone loves a delicious treat.  So what Dr. Steve sent has to be something that everyone's going to love.  Why does Dr. Steve keep sending stuff?  Because he's a psychopath.  He's, uh.  It's all poison.  He's like.  By our love.  Um.  All right.  Let's look in there.  Yeah.  Let's take a look.  Peel that back.  Peel back the old wrapping.  It's tin foil.  What is that?  It's round.  That looks pretty good.  Oh, it smells like, what's that pecan pie? 
[03:51:30]  It is.  Fuck is.  Sweet potato pecan pie.  You know what?  What the fuck is that?  I'll be honest.  I'm not having any, but I'll bet you that's fucking delicious.  No, it's not.  Why did you send it?  I'll bet it's not.  Cut a piece.  I'll have a little satinie bite.  What's wrong with the apple?  No, cut a teeny piece.  I'm having one bite only.  I'm not eating this stuff.  You want nuts in your pie?  Yeah.  Is there any significance to this pie?  If my pie means face, yes, he does.  I just got a notice to come sign for a package, and it was from Dr. Steve.  Hold on.  Sign this fucking wheel of miscarriage. 
[03:52:00]  Horrible.  That just looks awful.  I like it's coming apart.  It looks like vomit cake.  Is Dr. Steve addicted to getting name mentions on the show?  No.  Like, he just has to send weird stuff.  Not as much as you.  Yeah, but at least...  Oh, woo.  I'm calling you an air whore.  I can speak up.  Oh, that's true.  You won't even cut right.  I'm not sending you a lot of things.  It's cakey and full...  Nah, it's delicious.  It's made from the innards of cadavers.  I'm a creep.  Look, it just falls apart.  What is this?  Heart cake? 
[03:52:30]  It's not meant to be a pie.  A head burn.  Cut me a piece of cake.  Oh, my God.  You are a shaky motherfucker.  Holy shit, you're a nervous wreck.  You're on the air every day.  Cut another piece of net funicello.  Exactly.  This is the most excited Eric has ever been for a guest.  I know.  It's annoying.  The pie.  Hey, fucking...  Hey, Michael J.  I'll get a little whipped cream.  I'll have a teeny bite or two.  The whipped cream's gonna make it taste good.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  How is it, Jimmy?  Sweet potato, pecan pie. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  Jimmy's savoring the moment.  I gotta be honest.  It's good.  Is it?  Yeah.  What does it taste like?  Sweet potatoes and pecans, stupid.  I don't need that shit.  No, fuck that.  If that was apple pie, I'd be all up in that shit.  I'd be shooting trays up in that piece.  Anybody else?  No.  No.  It's all yours.  Throw it in the garbage.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Give it away.  Don't throw it out.  Give it to people.  There's people here to leave. 
[03:53:30]  That's what Dr. Steve tried to do.  Oh, man.  Here, don't throw that.  That's a fucking big food product.  It's a sin.  Nah, but you know, come on.  There's people here that leave.  Hey, Ma, it's a sin.  Get wasted, you know?  You can't fucking...  Maybe Oliver Stone wants some.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny if pecan pie reminded him of being molested and he ran out?  Aw.  No?  No.  Back to that, Jim.  Whatever.  I don't think...  I'm a one-trick fucking memory wiper out of her.  Can we have a napkin, please?  Because now this is all sticky for Oliver Stone, for fuck's sake.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Yeah.  Dump some fucking water on that shit. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  He's going to be all fucked up at that.  I know.  Now, Oliver Stone is obviously coming in because he has the untold history of the United States.  He's got a book here and there's a documentary.  It's like a ten-part documentary series on Showtime.  I've watched the first four.  Yeah.  It's very good.  He narrates it all.  He directed it all.  It's a very, very interesting series.  Are we going to ask him anything else?  Like about other works? 
[03:54:30]  We only have him for...  How long have we have him for?  About 20, 25 minutes.  Oh, okay.  Like Platoon?  Maybe more if he comes in early.  And JFK?  Yeah, well, I'm going to ask him if he'll sign them, but I mean, not at the moment.  But I do want to ask him about...  Yeah, there's so much here for him to talk about.  We can go anywhere with Oliver Stone, I'm sure.  Yes, we can.  Watch him just not talk.  So you wrote the book, yeah?  Yeah.  So history, right?  Yeah.  Read the book.  As long as we get a picture with him.  That's all I care about.  Really?  It's my Oliver Stone shot.  That's a good one.  He's a big one. 
[03:55:00]  He's a big shot.  And I hear he's not doing much, what they call press, right?  No.  No, he's not.  We got him, and then he's doing a...  Town hall.  A townie hall.  Oh, yeah?  With Pete Dominic, who I'm sure will be...  Oh, yeah?  Good.  Is that reasonable?  Oh, really?  A town hall with Pete Dominic?  Pete the Commie Dominic, yes.  Oh, I'm sure they'll trade their conservative ideology with each other.  What did you just call him?  Pete the Commie Dominic.  Pete the Comedy Dominic?  No, Commie.  Commie.  Oh, oh.  I thought I heard his comedy.  Old lefty Dominic.  Yeah. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  I see him on the...  What is he on?  CNN every so often?  They pop him on there?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a contributor.  To completely refute that CNN ideology, boy.  Let me tell you.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, please.  Because left of MSNBC.  I wonder if he voted for Obama.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oliver Stone and Pete Dominic.  He did.  Oliver Stone endorsed Ron Paul, but voted for Obama.  Ron Paul.  So, Oliver, you direct films. 
[03:56:00]  I hear...  What do you hear?  I hear you direct films.  Yeah.  So, JFK, what do you got?  JFK, go.  Yeah.  Go.  You think it was a conspiracy?  A lot of people don't...  Go.  Go.  What do you got?  Run with it.  Take the ball.  So, could you have written a bigger fucking book, dude? 
[03:56:30]  It's a big book.  How obnoxious would that be?  That is.  I was watching the documentary.  I'm going to be...  I'm going to enjoy speaking to him about it because I don't know if I agree 100%.  I'm sure there's some that I don't agree with.  Yeah.  From his take on some of the American history.  I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  Like, I'm sure that...  What's that?  You make that up?  The truth lies somewhere in the middle. 
[03:57:00]  I did, actually.  Between shadow and substance.  No, no, no.  Things and ideas.  Well, no.  It's just I'm giving you the answer.  When I said to myself in the mirror, what is it you are sexually?  I just don't know.  No, I think it's...  Like, I think he makes some great points.  And I'm sure that the Soviets were a lot more legit than the U.S. has given them credit for over the years.  But were we, yeah, I mean, again, and I will tell him this, I think you've got to take history in the context of the time, of history. 
[03:57:30]  You can't look at history, and I've argued this many times on this very program, you can't take history and base it on today's morality, today's world environment, and make an assessment or judgment on whether it was just or ethical or anything else.  You can't judge history based on today's ideology. 
[03:58:00]  That's why I always look at things like the slaughter of those engines and conquests that went on.  That's what happened then.  That's what people were.  Then how come the morality in the Constitution is still considered valid?  Like, when you look at...  We can't have it both ways.  Like, we look at, say, the forefathers, and we go, well, they were different...  There were more than that, from what I get.  No, no, but only the four that we listened to.  Oh, right.  The five was a real cocksucker.  But what about, why do we hold the morality... 
[03:58:30]  Why is free speech and those messages still valid, but their immorality was not?  It's almost like we can't say, well, the morality of the world was different then.  Well, if the world was different then, then their views on free speech and their views on the right to bear arms shouldn't be valid any more than their views on owning slaves were valid.  Well, the Constitution has been amended to reflect the change in morality and environment.  So, they did factor that in.  Yeah. 
[03:59:00]  You know, I...  I'm just passing through, man.  I know somebody big coming through.  Yeah.  My nigga!  All right!  What up?  What's up, my nigga?  What he said.  My n-word.  My n-words.  I told you, Anthony, you'd become a big fan.  I'm not going to respect that fucking...  Disrespect that word by just relegating it to an initial.  Yeah, you got it.  To one letter.  Right.  It's a great word, and it ought to be celebrated.  22 million black people say it every day. 
[03:59:30]  Fuck yeah!  Well, you could say it.  That's right.  Come on, just give me one.  Just give me one, Sam.  Exactly.  Well, in this context, it doesn't seem right.  At some point, I will.  See you a nigga, man.  In our conversation.  Oh, man.  I'm saying it with love, too.  Not like I yell it out the window on my drive home every day.  Was there ever a moment, though, when you were...  When you're doing JFK, was there a moment where you actually...  Wow.  What?  That's not Oliver.  I'm practicing for Oliver Stone.  I have my friend here, and I'm practicing for...  I'm not nervous around who, kid. 
[04:00:00]  I can't front on him, man.  That's the nigga right there.  Right.  You know how much movies he's done, man?  Who Kid came in as nigga Spider-Man the other day?  I heard that show.  So I guess now he's playing nigga Oliver Stone.  Some niggas said I was cute downstairs.  I don't know.  Was that cool?  He did?  Wow.  I came out of the parking lot, and then some guys...  A guy?  Thought I was cute.  Well, you got a little, what, Ralph Lauren sweater on today, I guess?  Oh, you got a little scarf tied around your neck.  You think that's how you think it's a V-neck?  I don't know.  A polo shirt?  You decided to dress cute today for some reason, Who Kid. 
[04:00:30]  I should have never said thank you.  Should I have said thank you?  Or should I have said fuck you?  No.  Thank you is the appropriate answer.  Oh, really?  Fuck you.  I might have taken that as an offer.  I mean, it's okay to be gay, but God.  I don't want that shit.  He'd be like, fuck you.  And he'd be like, well, you will?  You got your courses ready, man?  Yeah.  So, was anybody injured making platoon?  Did you use real guns that just weren't loaded?  Damn, shit.  Yo, he got his courses ready, man.  Right.  I'm fucking ready.  That's a good question.  There weren't any gay scenes in platoon?  There was no gay scenes.  Did they cut a dick off or something like that? 
[04:01:00]  They did not.  No.  There was a rape scene of some young Asian girls in the woods.  Oh, yeah.  But there was a guy that cut his dick off and put it in his mouth.  Wasn't that not true?  Police up your dicks.  That's what they said.  Police up your dicks.  Meaning, you know, put them back in your pants.  Oh, shit.  Shit like that, yo.  That's what they should do.  I'm not sure if they cut anybody's dick off.  And the Asians used to cut dicks off and put it in their mouth.  And Sal got all fucked up.  Oh, man.  That's pretty fucking heinous right there.  That's very vicious.  Yeah.  Very, very vicious.  It's savage. 
[04:01:30]  He did Wall Street.  Yeah, that's...  He directed Wall Street.  That's my favorite.  No, I did, but I'm saying...  I'm just...  You forget 94 was a...  He's amazing what he's done.  Is he a billionaire?  No.  Born on the 4th of July.  He has gotten some amazing performances out of people, man.  Yes.  He got Cruz's best performance of all time.  Born on the 4th of July, he should have won the Oscar for it.  Yeah.  That's the best thing Cruz has ever done.  Wasn't he...  Rodney in fucking Natural Born Killers is great.  Dangerfield?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, go upstairs and take a bath.  He was going to do Boys in the Hood, but Ice Cube took over. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah, Oliver Stone got beef with Cube, you know?  Was that...  Oh, man.  Was Singleton his name is who did that?  Anthony Singleton, yeah.  Was that...  Anthony, right?  No, Ken.  No, that's a baseball player.  John Singleton.  John Singleton.  John Singleton.  Anthony Singleton.  Yeah, Anthony.  You said Ken.  Yeah, but at least I was closer.  Three letters.  You fucking added six syllables.  John is...  Whatever.  Yeah, John Singleton.  So everybody's waiting.  I see I got the books everywhere.  The cameras.  Yeah, we're just hanging. 
[04:02:30]  Bullshitting.  We were just discussing how the American history, which Oliver Stone wrote a book, Untold History  of the United States, how American history, I believe, has to be kept in the context of  the time and can't be judged on the morality and the, I don't know, the environment today.  You can't judge history based on how we feel today.  So things like the elimination and conquest of the continent from the Indians, things like  even slavery, these are things that are put in the context of the time where it was 
[04:03:00]  accepted because it was the business as usual.  Don't you think that history is told from a white man's perspective, traditionally?  Yeah.  You think so, right?  It's his story.  Right.  They told me not to believe the history books when I was in Catholic school.  And then they pounded that fucking George Washington Carver all over the place like  he was fucking inventing all kinds of shit.  Certain things can't be judged.  You're right.  Because of the time, you have to give that leeway.  But there are some things that were wrong back then, too. 
[04:03:30]  Like to say that conquests weren't wrong in the 1400s, people had the, their morality was  close enough to our morality today where they knew conquesting was a violent wrong act.  It's what you did.  There wasn't dealing.  You didn't have to send your fucking lawyer over on a ship to have the guys sign documents.  Yeah, no, I know.  You know, here you go.  We're going to pay you a fair price for this land.  What they knew was we got a great Navy, an army.  We send it over.  We wipe the fuck out of what's there. 
[04:04:00]  We start building our own shit until someone bigger and stronger comes over and takes it  from us.  That was the way they did business.  To try to even comprehend this type of morality on those people, they wouldn't even get it.  But they had it for themselves.  Murder was still a crime.  Rape was a crime.  They had the same morality for themselves.  Like they, it wasn't like they were accepting certain treatments for themselves.  If you treated them a certain way, they were appalled.  If you silenced their religion, they were, so it's like they weren't that different from 
[04:04:30]  what we are today.  Murder is still looked at as a bad thing.  Yeah.  And it's illegal.  Yet in war, they're not sending these guys to prison for killing people.  Right.  And in the future, perhaps we will look back at any type of warfare and go, how the fuck  did they do that?  It was wrong.  But meanwhile, we're looking at it now and there are just wars.  People fight wars.  World War II, that is a just war.  A lot of people died.  And maybe in the future, that will be looked at in that environment as something that was 
[04:05:00]  deplorable and horrid and never should have happened.  But does that make it wrong based on how people felt at the time?  No, it doesn't.  No, but there's also, again, like when you look at the, like, that's like saying, well,  the Nazis, what they did because it was the time.  And I know that's an extraordinary example, but we can look at that.  They're not that different morally from us then than we are now where that is not an  absolute reprehensible crime.  So again, even when you go back to the Roman times where Alexander the Great, they knew what 
[04:05:30]  they were doing was, even though it was the way they did it.  That's like saying that, you know, committing certain crimes today is okay because someday  they will look back and judge us kindly in the context of history.  Hmm.  I mean, well, that's a human condition, though.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What's that music?  Oh, boy, you're crazy.  No, I, is it rexing?  I hear it.  I hear it. 
[04:06:00]  Wait.  Serious?  You can hear some?  The Manfred.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It was my headphones.  Oh, shit.  No, no.  It was in my iPods.  What was it?  Fucking village people, you faggots?  Ozzy Osbourne.  S-A-T-O.  Oh, all right.  Fuck me running.  I heard something.  Fuck me running.  Like I was saying, the human condition anyway is all about murder and conquer.  Anyway, look at Kunta Kinte.  He was killing a million Africans and then he killed a few white people on the way to him.  That shit happened.  Look at how we romanticize even shit from not even that long ago. 
[04:06:30]  The Billy the Kid.  A lot of these Old West criminals that were murderers and fucking criminals.  Yet now, in context, it's romanticized, but it doesn't make it any more horrific then.  But we still do that.  John Gotti.  We still look at these guys as heroes.  Anti-heroes.  But that's why everything.  John Gotti is?  The fucking brothers love Gotti.  No, they love him.  Fucking gangster because he's an OG.  Why do you say they like you're not a black guy? 
[04:07:00]  I've been white for eight years.  You've been white for eight years.  Jesus Christ.  I need to find white gainfully employed.  Serious acceptance just changes everybody to white up here.  I don't know, man.  Yeah, they do?  Is that what happens?  Look at my shirt.  Some guy thought I was cute.  That shit's not cool, man.  That's true.  I mean, Shade 45, Eminem, white guy.  No, but black people, in general, they just idolize gangsterism.  Like, anybody that killed anyone is like Jesus Christ or something like that. 
[04:07:30]  They love fucking, like, Scarface.  Oh, God.  Scarface is like fucking an amazing motion picture.  The cartels love him.  Like, when they raid these cartel places, the Mexicans, they have pictures of Scarface.  I bet Pacino could go to, like, any cartel, they would idolize him.  Any gangster place in the world, Pacino would be welcome because that role.  And the godfather?  I mean, the guy is the fucking king.  He's fucking, they, but I heard that, like, they were raiding these cartel places and they 
[04:08:00]  all had Scarface posters.  Yeah.  He's just what they want to be.  He was their image of themselves.  A cool guy with morals because he had a code, you know, you don't kill kids.  You know, like, he was how they see themselves.  Wouldn't that be great if he just barged into, like, a giant cartel fucking operation and  just went, all right, freeze!  Yeah.  And then they look and he goes, I'm just kidding.  They're like, oh, man.  They're hugging him.  Just fucking showing him how they run their fucking operation.  Say hello to my, but he didn't do the line right.  Say hello to my small friend. 
[04:08:30]  And he pulls his dick out.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Sucks.  Say hello to my little wig.  He gets him a present.  It's a clock with the 12 missing.  Yeah.  Like, hole in it.  No one will notice.  It's funny you say that because I DJed for Qaddafi and they love Scarface.  Really?  Especially Al Pacino.  Like, Qaddafi from, you know, the one that they murdered.  Yeah.  I DJed for Moammar Qaddafi.  You DJed for Moammar Qaddafi.  In Venice.  Do you have a picture with him?  Yeah, I got photos with him, too.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's a good one.  Oh, yeah.  That might be one of the big ones for you. 
[04:09:00]  That is probably one of the toughest photos to get.  Yeah.  I had to take it down from Facebook because, you know, they were trying to murder him.  So, I had a photo that I showed to you.  Man.  Yeah, you want to unfriend somebody like that.  You don't want to be on his friend list when they start getting the peripheral people around  him.  America killed him, right?  They murdered him, right?  No, it was on people, too.  We ate it with weapons, but it was living.  Oh, we helped out, though.  Believe me.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  We said everything died because that was your money?  I didn't give that money back, you know, because Beyonce performed for him and shit, 
[04:09:30]  like, wiggled her butt and got paid a million dollars.  Like, even you.  Why would you perform for that guy?  Was it just cash?  They paid.  I mean, I didn't know he was a terrorist at that time.  I mean, I don't know.  You'd have been there in the fucking 30s.  You'd have been like, this Hitler guy likes to party?  I'm just going to fucking spin a few.  I realized when I saw the Uzis and stuff.  Yeah, you're fucking, you're cutting up fucking Ride of the Valkyries or fucking.  They love Will Smith.  I don't know why.  They love Miami.  I don't know why they love that record, man. 
[04:10:00]  Gaddafi loved Will Smith records?  Gangster Rap and Miami.  Oh, man.  I like Will Smith, too, but I like the Fresh Prince.  You're off.  Today is Saturday.  Nah, he was a little.  He wasn't very hard.  They didn't listen to Wild Wild West?  Nah.  The Wild Wild West.  I played Miami like 13 times.  The Wild Wild West.  They loved it.  They love La Isla Bonita.  Okay.  Oh, man.  This is the Gaddafi household.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  Yeah.  He's a new shit right here.  He's not a good song.  Did Muammar dance around and shit?  Yeah. 
[04:10:30]  He moved his head.  Yeah.  He just bopping.  It was crazy.  What?  It was crazy.  Damn.  They had jet skis, too.  I don't know why, but.  He should have moved his head when that bullet was swinging towards it.  Yeah, exactly.  He looked right into it.  What is this?  The barrel of a gun, you idiot.  Duck.  How much did he pay you to DJ?  $15,280.  Wow.  For how long?  For one night?  One hour.  One hour.  $15,000.  Was it an even number in their silly money?  I think it was.  Is that why it worked out like that? 
[04:11:00]  That's what I got.  It was like their money, and then I got $15,280 when I changed it.  Damn.  This is 200 million fruk-nooks.  I can't say that.  It's a fruk-nook.  In order to say it, you have to turn your head to the left and squeeze your clitoris  for the vice if you're a woman.  And it's his $15,000 and change.  I don't know.  His son bought 50's outfit, like 50 Cent, performed also, and another time.  And then 50 had a leather militant suit on, and the son paid $300,000 for his outfit. 
[04:11:30]  Why so much?  Fuck.  Because they got that money.  Did he offer him that much, or did he offer him $500,000 and 50's like, no.  I was trying to sell my pants for like 10 G's, but...  They weren't biting, huh?  They weren't biting for that.  He wired $300,000 to his account.  Wow.  Right there.  Nobody wanted your pants?  Yeah, I tried.  Well, they have a hole in the back.  People are like, no use for those.  See, I'm cute now.  At what point does Gaddafi be like, okay, I really want hook-in?  Like, that's the guy I need for my party.  They had all my mixtapes.  The sons. 
[04:12:00]  Oh, really?  The sons that they murdered, they had all the genuine mixtapes.  So they lived that lifestyle, like, you know.  So you're looking at all these customers being killed.  This can't be good for business.  Yeah, but I think I'm cool with that.  Were you sad on September 11th when you lost 19 fans?  Really?  What the fuck, man?  That's great.  I didn't know.  Yo, I was very unaware until we got there to Venice.  But would you have not gone?  I didn't. 
[04:12:30]  Yo, I was.  I don't know.  He was giving you $15,280.  I didn't know about all this crazy shit going on, huh?  But if you did, you still would have gone for the $15,000?  If I knew?  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't have gone.  When are you playing for Ahmadinejad?  Anytime soon?  Who kid?  Who kid?  Let's all hate the Jew kid.  I would have avoided it.  I would have avoided it.  But a lot of people didn't know.  Look, Beyonce went.  Everybody went out there.  Beyonce.  I heard about that.  About Beyonce going down there.  I guess we're unaware because you don't see him until he just pops up out of nowhere.  Oh, it's like an agency is hiring you or something. 
[04:13:00]  They hire you and then he just pops up.  And you're like, okay, we're here with.  Oh, it's fucking Gaddafi.  Right.  All the women had Uzis and they're all like models.  Really?  They're all bad as fuck.  His security was like fucking women with hot chicks?  Because he fucks them.  Because, you know, during the war, you know, if you need to fuck immediately, the security  got to look hot.  That's what they told me.  Yeah.  Because he might need to fuck right away.  Yeah.  And then they go back and they watch him.  Oh, jeez.  That's like fucking Bond.  That is real shit.  Fucking James Bond shit.  Do you guys do that with Club Soda Kenny ever? 
[04:13:30]  Why?  Like if you need a quick fuck, like while you're on the road, will you just fuck Kenny?  Yeah.  He just lays there like a fucking snowboard on his stomach and I mount him.  Kenny knows that my cum tastes like coconut.  I don't know.  He just told me that.  Does your cum taste like coconut?  I don't know.  Have you tasted it before?  I've never tasted it, buddy.  That's the first thing Kenny told me.  Troy Kwan says every man has tasted their own cum.  Oh, man.  Who kid got mad street cred?  I don't know what that means.  He got a big old dick and his cum tastes like coconut.  Yeah.  That's the first thing he told me. 
[04:14:00]  What?  A porn star was bragging about it.  How do you know all this?  Word on the street.  Word on the street.  I think Oliver Stone is on his way out.  He's coming up in a second.  Is he?  I'm out of here.  Yeah, but let's talk about who kid's big dick.  We've spoken about it.  With Oliver Stone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be great.  Maybe he can star in his next movie.  I don't know.  I need my dick here when I leave.  Why don't you step outside.  Leave your dick behind.  And then if we get to it, we'll get to it.  Yeah.  We'll ask Oswald if he thinks this thing was in the grassy knoll in 63. 
[04:14:30]  He's got his dick.  The shadow isn't lining up with the rest of them.  Yeah.  My dick is popular right now.  I've got to piss real quick.  Oh, go piss.  You better hurry.  If you bump into him in the hallway, you're in big trouble.  No number twos.  No number twos.  No number twos.  Yep.  No taking a dump.  So what's your secret who kid?  How do you get your cum to taste like coconut?  I don't know, man.  I thought we had an excuse to eat coconut.  That might do it.  Pina colada.  Yeah.  Drink some pina coladas.  What does your cum taste like, Sam?  I never tasted my cum.  Does it taste like vinegar or something? 
[04:15:00]  Why do you think my cum is?  Is that a white thing?  You're like a vinegar guy.  I don't know.  Why is that?  No, I'm sure my cum is absolutely delicious.  Yeah.  It probably tastes like cocoa pebbles, honestly.  Really?  I think so.  I eat a lot of cocoa pebbles.  Maybe.  You know?  You cum what you eat.  That's what they say, isn't it?  I don't want to get personal, but does your loved one enjoy the taste of your cum?  She's never specifically complained about it, but she's never ever also been like,  what a delicious treat that was.  Thank you for the load.  That's a bad sign. 
[04:15:30]  She hasn't bragged about it.  Yeah, you need a little bragging.  That's a bad sign.  What about your loved one, Kevin?  What about her?  What did she say about your jizz?  This isn't about me.  We're talking about who kid and his big cock.  Listen.  You're like, man, I don't know what's going on right now.  That's crazy.  Do you have delicious cum, Anthony, while we're on the topic?  I don't know.  I don't fucking partake.  See, what did you think when Troy said, every man has tasted their own cum, and if they haven't,  they're lying. 
[04:16:00]  Well, there's different levels.  If you just do a headstand and spunk in your face and start gobbling it up, that's different  than maybe blowing a load and then licking some clit right on the outside of the pussy after you cum.  You might taste some residual, but you're not just like, you know.  You don't get enough to know what the flavor is.  You're not getting a heaping helping, as they say.  Isn't it still alive?  That's on your tongue, though.  I don't know if you can impregnate yourself that way, if that's what you're asking. 
[04:16:30]  I don't think that's possible.  Swimming.  Oh, Arnold Schwarzenegger did it in that movie.  That might have been how he did it.  I'll state for the record that I never have, and I'm not lying.  Good for you, Club Soda.  Good for you.  Well, we didn't ask Mr. You-Know-Who about tasting his cum.  Oh, Jimmy.  What's your cum taste like, Jim?  Yeah, I have.  Apparently, who kids taste like cum?  Why am I not surprised?  Of course.  Not many times, though.  What does it taste like?  Bleach and just terrible.  It's not good.  Yeah, that Clorox thing is serious.  Not good. 
[04:17:00]  Need some more pina coladas, I guess.  Yeah, I drink a lot of pina coladas.  I don't drink.  Virgin pina coladas.  No, who kid is obviously very virile.  Why are you so obsessed with who kid and his penis and his sex life?  Should I give him a photo of my dick?  I don't know.  I guess.  Who kid's the bomb?  He'll carry it around in his wallet like it's one of his kids.  That's got to do iPhone 5, too.  Yeah?  Oh, man.  Where'd you get it?  A Verizon or AT&T?  Nah, they're giving them away.  Obama phone!  He says, if this is Obama came into office, they're giving it away. 
[04:17:30]  Who kid?  I'm out of here.  We're going to have to clear the field.  Oh, man.  I'm going with who kid.  Thanks for popping in, man.  I never get to hang out with you because I'm always on my way home.  I know.  That's right.  Yeah.  And you know what?  My neighborhood, I don't see any people like who kid.  And who kid.  You know why he always does the after show.  Why's that?  CPT.  He's trying to do O&A.  Really?  Late.  All right.  Late.  I'm feeling him, yo. 
[04:18:00]  All right.  So the first question is going to be Oliver.  Oliver.  Oliver.  Oliver Stone.  You direct movies, motion pictures, the visual medium.  You should be clicking a pen the whole time, too.  Yeah.  So, uh.  What?  Obnoxious.  What do you think is happening in history? 
[04:18:30]  That's a really awful question.  Travis.  Long-winded, too.  Update.  Make the worst use of the time possible.  Yeah.  Yes.  Really long-winded.  Play it a bit.  Finish up the E-Rock contest.  Oh, my God.  That'd be great.  Oliver, why don't you tell me what you think of this?  We got a man juicing his own penis.  Right.  We're going to play some Scott and Todd for you.  I wish I had read more of the book.  We just got it late.  I wish I had read a book.  I'm stupid.  I don't read a lot of books. 
[04:19:00]  I'm actually anxious.  I'm nervously anxious.  Are you?  In a good way, though.  He's a big star.  Like, not a movie star kind of guy, but he's a fucking huge power.  He's a very legitimate guy.  He's a player.  I'd call him an A-lister.  I don't think I'm going out on him.  He's a player.  He's one of the greatest directors of all time, and he speaks through his work.  You kind of know how he feels by the angle he takes in his films.  He's really tremendous, man.  And he's done some of my favorite movies.  Absolutely.  JFK and fucking Wall Street, which I love.  Watch Platoon whenever it's on.  I watch that goddamn movie. 
[04:19:30]  Natural Born Killers.  Wall Street might be my favorite.  That was good.  Really good.  Platoon's great, though.  Natural Born Killers is awesome.  I forgot.  Talk Radio he did.  I forgot that.  Holy shit.  You're a dead fucker.  I want to ask him who that guy was.  And you know, Tarantino wouldn't put his name on the movie because of the scene that you  like so much, the Rodney scene.  Why?  Because Tarantino wrote the original script, I guess, and Oliver Stone took it in that sort  of weird sitcom-y direction, and apparently, that's not how Tarantino had written it, and 
[04:20:00]  he didn't want his name on it.  Apparently.  Wow.  He didn't like the film for a while, right?  Yeah.  Only recently did he kind of...  Admit to the fact that he wrote it.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's such a great movie.  Yeah, it is great.  It's such a great statement on where reality TV was going with Mickey and Mallory.  It was like, that stuff really wasn't being done as much then, but it was headed there.  It's on reality TV.  It's Barnes.  Sergeant Barnes.  We should just talk to him in different characters from his movies. 
[04:20:30]  Oh, that would be perfect.  Perfect.  I should just do Martin Sheen from Wall Street.  Yes.  You know, I like you, but then again, I don't judge a man by the size of his wallet.  Just do really obscure, creepy lines.  Yeah.  Call him...  What did he call him?  Bud Fox?  They just called him Buddy.  Buddy?  Was it?  Yeah.  Bud.  They'll all call him Pal.  Because Michael Douglas says Pal better than everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Pal.  It's like, what a slimy way of saying Pal.  What a fucking prick he was in that movie. 
[04:21:00]  Just fantastic.  I actually thought part two was good.  He did Nixon, which I did not see.  The Doors was great.  Born on the Fourth of July.  Doors, yeah.  Jesus fucking Christ.  He did the George Bush movie.  Yes.  I didn't see that.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  Josh Brolin.  I like that one.  Josh Brolin fucking did an amazing George Bush.  I like that Josh Brolin.  He's a great actor.  He's fucking good.  Is he married to Streisand?  No, that's his dad is married to Streisand.  And Josh Brolin, you might remember from a little movie called The Goonies. 
[04:21:30]  That's right.  They're good enough.  He was the male lead underground, the older of the boys.  The bully at first.  That the red-haired girl was kind of in love with.  Oh, not the bully.  No, he was bullied.  No, he was one of the, he was like the guy.  Right.  Yeah.  Is he the one who got his hand, like held his hand onto the car and he had to ride his,  he had to pedal his bicycle really quick?  Yeah, he was the brother.  That's what I thought.  What?  Yeah.  It's a big scene in the movie. 
[04:22:00]  What?  Before they go underground.  The douchebag in the car grabs his arm while he's riding the little girl's bike.  He was, he was bullied.  He was dragged down the road.  And we, we would be negligent if we didn't thank Ron and Fez, because they're going late  tonight at our request, so thank you to those guys.  Yeah, at our request.  No, but that was nice of them.  Yeah.  They were totally, uh.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, boy.  No.  That's just Sal.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Update, update.  Travis?  Oh, he might be on his way.  What's the holdup?  I don't know.  It's on, it's on his end.  We're ready. 
[04:22:30]  Okay.  He's just such a weirdo.  Yeah.  Could be anything.  You think?  Yeah.  He might be coming in through the back way, so.  Oh, not the main entrance?  Yeah.  Why?  No, I mean, he might not be coming through the lobby.  Roland might bring him through.  The lobby.  Oh, yeah.  Tell Roland to bring him the other way.  Tell him, as per my orders.  Then we'll see.  I've always wanted to say that.  Like, if I'm with a massage girl, I'm like, put a finger in my ass, as per my orders.  Right back there.  You've got to have such a variety of humor.  Yes.  It's not incest or age or rape.  It's my asshole with a finger in it.  Man.  Repeat. 
[04:23:00]  I can't wait to, um, well, obviously speak with Oliver Stone, but once I get home, more Call of  Duty Black Ops.  I'm so psyched.  I love video games.  God.  A good game.  No, I like a lot of them, quite frankly.  I use the Xbox Kinect to do bowling, which is very accurate.  I'm very surprised at how accurate the throw is and everything.  Also, some of the other sports.  I think we've got somebody walking up the hallway. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, shit.  I'll give you a hint.  Oh, shit.  That's him right there.  JFK.  I see Oliver Stone.  I'm going to say, how was it when they brought you in at the end of the Brady Bunch as the  youngest brother?  That's a different one.  Watch him pretend not to recognize me.  He's notorious for the guys he really admires.  Put your game face on, man.  Put your game face on.  Not that one.  No, Chip, I don't want to fucking hear from Chip. 
[04:24:00]  Oliver Stone, what are you like, Rocky?  Fucking place that's going to crack up.  Watch it.  That's good.  You're good.  Oh, my God.  Hi.  Don't worry.  No, don't worry.  We have a very relaxed program here.  I'm serious.  Hello.  There he is.  Hi, sir.  Hello, Oliver.  Take a seat, gentlemen.  I'm Jim, and this is Anthony.  That's young Sam Roberts over there.  Hello.  How are you?  Running the board.  Hi.  How are you?  We're on the air.  Take a seat.  Yeah, we actually, oh, don't worry.  We're very relaxed here.  I tie my shoelaces, but I just walked in, and they fell apart. 
[04:24:30]  Sure.  Feel free.  I like that.  That's very responsible of you to be safe.  Tie the old shoelaces.  Okay, that's Peter.  Is this my phone?  Yeah, that's yours, Peter.  Pull that one right towards you, whatever you need to do.  Okay.  Because you're on the air all day, that's why you get so informal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're just very relaxed.  We find that when we try to be formal, we just fuck it up.  We fail miserably.  Four hours a day.  Today, five.  We stayed late for you.  Of which we'll occupy a blip of your time.  Yeah, a blip. 
[04:25:00]  A blip, but a very good blip.  Huge fans of your work.  I got to tell you right off the bat there, I'm not breaking any new ground there.  You're an amazing director and writer.  And now you have a book, and I saw the documentary also.  Unbelievable.  The first four parts I saw, we don't have all of them yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't have all the parts yet.  That's four hours?  That's a lot for your fans.  It really is.  It took me three months, but I mean, I did enjoy them.  It's fantastic.  Ten hours coming.  It runs through January every week on Showtime, every Monday night at eight. 
[04:25:30]  And there's repeats all the time, I guess.  And Showtime is a premium cable, no advertising, so you sign on to the program, and you can  get all the shows, I guess, on Showtime anytime.  Yeah, it's like an on-demand, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  You raise an interesting point, too.  You talk a lot in the documentary, at least, about Stalin and the Soviets being a much better  ally in World War II than their—because the whole push of this, the book is called  The Untold History of the United States, and it's about how we were kind of taught in 
[04:26:00]  an accurate history.  And where do you think that the Soviets have been wronged in the historical telling?  That's a long story.  Peter, can you start and tell it briefly?  Because it is radio.  Well, even your perspective that the ways in which they were better allies, the question  is, how was the United States as an ally toward them?  Is a more interesting twist on it, because they were the ones who were doing most of the  fighting against the Germans, which the Americans don't know.  They were invaded.  Yeah, they were obviously.  They were invaded, and during most of the war, they were facing 200 German divisions, while 
[04:26:30]  the United States and the British were facing 10 combined before June 1944.  They lost 27 million people.  We lost a little over 300,000.  So there's a big difference.  But Americans don't know that part of the history.  Part of this idea is that the United States is this great benevolent force that always comes  marching in on the white horses and saves the day everywhere.  And it was the other way around in World War II, the Americans were off with the British  in northern Africa, securing the British Empire, going after the soft underbelly. 
[04:27:00]  And we had promised the Soviet Union that we were going to set up a second front to take  the pressure off them before the end of 1942.  But we don't actually do it until June of 1944.  And so by the time the United States finally starts moving into Europe, the Soviets have already  defeated the German armies, and they're moving west.  And so there used to be a myth that Roosevelt gave away all this to Stalin at Yalta.  Well, Stalin had already taken all of that militarily. 
[04:27:30]  Roosevelt didn't give away anything that Stalin didn't already have.  And you seem to think American exceptionalism, the idea of American exceptionalism, if you  fight that at all, you're kind of demonized.  Like you said, Obama kind of said, yeah, I agree with American exceptionalism, the way the  Greeks agreed with Greek exceptionalism.  And is that something you've kind of always felt?  Like, you know, you're taught this stuff in school growing up, and do you kind of feel  like, ah, there's something wrong here?  Well, I was.  And I think most Americans are taught that, you know, we're the special country, that we're  very rich and obviously blessed, but that God has something to do with it. 
[04:28:00]  And that certainly our position after World War II, because I was born right after it, in  New York City, we were at the center of the world.  But, you know, as I led my life and had my experiences, not only in Vietnam, but everywhere  else, traveled everywhere in the world, I realized that everyone is pretty much in different,  has different customs, but there's a central humanity that's existed everywhere in the  world.  And that we are not, we don't, we do not have any God-given right to rule.  And although we seem to believe it in this country, that we have, we have global dominance 
[04:28:30]  now.  It's not even a national security state we've created, which is a monster.  We've created a global security state for, and what we're promising with the last election  is that we're going to be out there ensuring that America is a pivotal force in the coming  21st century, and that Obama is going now to Myanmar, I think it is next week, or to establish  again that we're going to contain and confront the Chinese in Asia. 
[04:29:00]  Now, this is what we did with the Soviets, but we did it in a much more hostile way after  World War II.  Do you feel, too, this is an interesting thing, like you did something with Hugo Chavez, and  I found myself watching this and even reading, getting defensive for America.  And I know that that's just an instinct because of what you've been taught in school.  I found myself getting angry at this idea, but I'm like, no, this is, you're rebelling,  because I'm taking it personally, which is, I guess, why we defend the nation, regardless 
[04:29:30]  of whether it's right or wrong.  We all take it personally, because we all have a subjective interest in our own country.  But, you know, the thing is, you have to look at it like we had the bomb.  We had a monopoly of the bomb for three, almost three and a half years after the war.  That gave us the right to dictate to others what we thought was the value system they  should share.  We were the good guys.  We were the right.  But we were only so because we had muscle.  The muscle was the bomb.  But there's no monopoly on any weapon, as we know.  And finally, the Soviets got a bomb. 
[04:30:00]  And that, but we kept on creating the fact that we were, the sense that we were the underdog  all through those years, saying that the Soviets are surrounding us.  They're, they're encircling our country, that the idea of communism is seeping into our domestic  schools, into our, into our books, into our movies, into our political system.  And we have this fear that I grew up with.  And it was, it's, it's distorted and warped us.  And we think we're, have to fight back all the time.  But don't, don't you have to look at certain things? 
[04:30:30]  I was telling, I was saying this earlier, in the context of the time, we could look back  into history using our morality and the environment of today.  But at the time, there was a clear threat from the Soviet Union.  And I think the United States had to do whatever it could to prepare the people to, right, right.  We actually, we actually see it differently.  Okay.  We see the United States and the Soviets as allies during World War II.  Most, the overwhelming majority of Americans thought that we would remain allies after 
[04:31:00]  the war.  Roosevelt said explicitly that we would remain allies after the war.  Something changes in 1945.  April 12th, 1945, Roosevelt dies and Harry Truman becomes president.  Truman had been vice president for 82 days.  He had spoken to Roosevelt twice about nothing of substance.  One of the astounding things is when Truman became president, he did not even know that we  were building an atomic bomb.  Just think about what that means.  Nobody had enough regard for Truman to even tell him we were building an atomic bomb. 
[04:31:30]  So he gets in there and he's in way over his head and he tells everybody he meets with,  this is a terrible mistake.  I shouldn't be president.  Somebody else who really knows what he's doing should be.  And he's right.  You know, he's not right about a lot of things in that period, but that's the one thing he's  right about.  And then he turns to all the wrong people for advice.  He turns to Stetinius.  He turns to Jimmy Burns.  He turns to Anthony Eden.  He turns to all the people who are the hardline anti-communists, anti-Sovietists, who Roosevelt 
[04:32:00]  was not giving any credence to in terms of these policies.  So if you look from Roosevelt's death for the next two weeks, our policy changes dramatically.  And now we're talking about the Soviets as our enemy.  Now we're accusing them of breaking the Yalta agreements of all these aggressive policies.  They hadn't done anything different yet.  They were doing what they had, what Roosevelt knew they were doing and what Wallace, his  vice president, had known they were doing.  But doesn't the sheer fact of the atrocities that happened under Stalin kind of show their  character as people we wouldn't want to be in an alliance with? 
[04:32:30]  Does the atrocities of the United States committed in Vietnam show our character?  No, it's much more complicated.  What they did there in terms of the gulags and in terms of the slaughter in the Ukraine  is horrendous.  And we write about that and we show that because we think that's appalling.  But that's very different than Stalin's foreign policy and whether or not, as Schlesinger  said, people looking back on the Cold War will look back and think about the way we look  back on the 30 years war that wrecked Europe. 
[04:33:00]  They say, why are we risking threatening the future existence of humanity over something  that could have been resolved and handled completely differently?  You don't feel that a Western alliance that kept the Soviets in check, considering that  the Eastern Bloc nations, I mean, they poured into those nations after the war.  And you don't think left unchecked they would have continued and that the United States had 
[04:33:30]  to go up against them as no more of an alliance?  I mean, absolutely not.  Really?  In fact, that's the difference between Stalin and Trotsky.  The big split, Trotsky believed in worldwide revolution.  He called it permanent revolution.  He thought that socialism had to really have a worldwide socialist revolution for the Soviet  Union to survive.  Stalin's approach was socialism in one country.  Stalin wanted the Soviet Union to actually build itself up, nationalize.  He was a nationalist in that sense.  He was never a revolutionary.  If you read his writings, this guy doesn't have a clue about international revolution. 
[04:34:00]  And so what he wanted in Eastern Europe was what they call the buffer zone, because they  had been attacked twice by the Germans through Eastern Europe.  And what they wanted was to make sure that's not going to happen again.  And so they want that.  And if you look in the first couple of years till 47, they're not demanding compliant  governments, lockstep governments.  They just want friendly governments in Eastern Europe.  Whether elections taking place.  We're not saying that they weren't brutal and cruel and oppressive because they were all of  that.  And they were that in their own country. 
[04:34:30]  As Stimson said, there are very few countries that share our idea of democracy.  Almost no countries in the world have our idea of democracy.  Stimson was secretary of war under Roosevelt and Truman.  And he said that we've got to start to see things a little bit more through the Soviet  eyes to see the way they feel beleaguered, to see what they've suffered.  So you say, I'm sorry, we're not judging, you guys aren't judging the moral goodness  of Stalin.  You're basically just judging our, not keeping our word as an ally with reparation or rebuilding  money or else.  Reparation is a huge factor. 
[04:35:00]  The $10 billion is promised to Stalin.  And just as a case in point, the Greek Civil War is at the birth of this Cold War.  It's a very key war.  And Churchill himself, who was an enemy of the Russia and Soviet Union, went out of his  way late in his life to say that Stalin never broke his word to me.  And he was talking about Greece because he said the British wanted to get back into Greece  as part of the British Empire.  In 1944, when we were still fighting, the British troops were fighting the liberation  movement communists in Greece on the streets of Athens. 
[04:35:30]  Roosevelt was shocked and horrified by it.  And the British went on and the Civil War developed.  We got involved.  It was our first taste of it with the Truman Doctrine.  We sent advisors over there and poured money into Turkey and Greece.  Stalin never fought that.  He had a big split with Tito of Yugoslavia because Tito was doing the right thing and  supporting the liberation movement in Yugoslavia, in Greece.  But Stalin did not support him because he had made an agreement with Churchill.  And we show that agreement in the second chapter next week. 
[04:36:00]  What do you think then the end game was for the United States to have an enemy like the  Soviet Union?  I can tell you that very simply because George Kennan, the architect of containment, lays it out.  He says, we're 6.3% of the world's population and we control 50% of the world's wealth.  He says, the real issue for us is how we keep that disparity.  He says, we're not going to do it by idealism.  We're not going to do it by professing great values. 
[04:36:30]  We're going to do it with strict power politics.  We're going to have to make sure that the United States dominates.  And that was the attitude.  You don't think in the entire 20th century that the United States was a very innovative  country, came up with a lot of, and gained its wealth in that respect also, and not just  through underhanded world politics?  Yes, but you have to look back at the history of how we gained our wealth.  You know, so much of it was built on the back of slavery.  And a lot of it was by stealing those lands on the frontier and by conquest of Mexico. 
[04:37:00]  Again, though, taking it in the context of the time.  Obviously, we could judge that now very negatively.  At the time, it seemed to be the way business was done.  There were a lot of people from the Constitutional Convention on who were strong, strong critics  of all of those policies, especially slavery.  You know, and as Thurgood Marshall says in 1987, on the 200th anniversary, he said, I 
[04:37:30]  can't look back and talk about the profound wisdom of the founding fathers because they  didn't deal with these issues.  It took civil war and other wars and another hundred years and all these amendments that  finally make a constitution of the sort that we have now.  What do you think the country would look like if we had been nicer as a country without  these atrocities?  Do you think we'd have a similar looking country now, or would it be something completely  different?  Well, it's ironic.  It's, I think it's a great question because it's a live and let live policy. 
[04:38:00]  Right.  What is more humanism?  What is a softer attitude?  You see, I think softness is the issue and it's so suspect in America.  A politician cannot be soft.  He cannot be compassionate.  And it seems like we like it in people, but yet we don't want it in our leaders.  We love the Martin Luther King of compassion, but at the same time, we kill him.  And Martin Luther King, of course, says America is the greatest prevailer of violence today  in 1966. 
[04:38:30]  Heaven.  Heaven.  So I would, I vote soft leadership, definitely.  And I think those would be the great presidents.  And I think that always is the case that John Kennedy that softens after the Cuban missile  crisis, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who's generous, who's able to, to, to take uncle  Joe, as he called him and make him an ally, as opposed to Churchill who wanted to fight with  him.  And I think that you see, and in, unfortunately, the early Carter, Jimmy Carter, it was very  successful.  Right.  A lot of what he did, he got undermined. 
[04:39:00]  Okay.  And then you have Obama promising things in 2003.  He votes against the Iraq war resolution.  Hillary Clinton goes the other way.  That was my define.  I said, this is the man for us.  That was my hope.  And I think he had the momentum to win and beat McCain.  And he did, if he had stuck to that, but somewhere along the way, he made his deal.  He cut his deal with Wall Street and the big farmers, farmers, and took their money because  he was worried that he couldn't beat McCain.  Something about American politics requires these people to be tough.  When he gets up against Romney in the third debate there, either man is trying to outdo 
[04:39:30]  each other to protect the American security.  And we're not going to give up.  And we're going to be the number one into the 21st century.  Hillary Clinton is still around.  And here she is saying, America's next century will be the Pacific century, which is an echo  of Henry Luce's famous comment.  Henry Luce was a conservative Time Magazine publisher, 1941, that makes a famous speech  calling the 20th century the American century.  But don't you also see that certain times demand different types of presidents? 
[04:40:00]  I mean, a soft president would be good.  Never had it.  Well, we have it in parts.  You bring up Jimmy Carter.  By being soft, Oliver means being compassionate.  Right.  I understand that.  He's being able to see the world through the eyes of our adversaries rather than a kind  of narrow parochial view.  I think that's what he means by soft.  But what of those adversaries?  Do you believe in any way, shape, or form there are some adversaries that just completely  do not like us for our lifestyle and our sense of freedom and immorality? 
[04:40:30]  That's what Bush told us when the al-Qaeda struck.  He said, why do they hate us?  They hate our freedoms.  He said that.  And that's not true.  If you look at what al-Qaeda was saying, they were objecting to Israel-Palestine issues.  I understand.  And they were objecting to U.S. troops on Saudi Arabian soil that were sent there, frankly,  under false pretext by George Bush Sr.  You don't think through some religious fanaticism that there is just a basic lifestyle that is 
[04:41:00]  their religion dictates that they eliminate?  They certainly made a deal with us in the 1980s.  They were taking money and weapons from us and training manuals from the CIA.  They left us because we were supplying them.  They're telling us we have to wrap, Oliver.  Oh, man.  Believe me, we don't want to wrap you.  But they're telling us...  You just come over to my house.  We'll continue this.  They're telling us that you have another thing to do, so we have to be done in a minute.  But we want to promote the book and everything properly before you go, so you're here to  plug.  Oliver and Peter wrote...  It's an amazing book from what I've read so far.  The Untold History of the United States. 
[04:41:30]  And I guess your point is that the history has been told enough times.  This is what has not been told.  It's an amazing, different take on history that we've all been told over the years.  But this is such a unique take on this.  It's a fantastic book, a fantastic documentary.  And it makes you think.  Yes, absolutely.  All of your work does that, even when I don't agree with you.  Like, I'm an Oswald guy.  But everything you do...  Yes, on Showtime.  ...makes people think.  Everything you do is compelling.  Your work is very compelling, which I think the best part of it as an artist, what you 
[04:42:00]  can do is make people question what they're feeling.  At least give them an alternate space.  My children don't have that in their history books yet.  It was funny.  I said, I'm an Oswald guy, and Oliver went to choke me.  But we're happy you came in.  You're a tremendous icon.  Thank you for coming as well.  I don't want to cut this short, but they're telling us we're going to have to.  Thank you.  Thanks so much.  And we'll see everybody right here.  Manana. </pre>
