<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie's delayed return following the birth of his son, Hudson, a large baby with a full head of hair.  The hosts and Steve, who had seen a picture, shared humorous and crude commentary about the baby's size and appearance, though the picture itself was deemed too private for broadcast.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to the Montreal Canadians' playoff victory and the subsequent rioting and looting by African-Canadians, specifically targeting sneakers from a Foot Locker.  They satirized the Mounties' response and debated the offensiveness of the Dudley Do-Right cartoon portrayal of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  A lengthy segment followed criticizing the current season of *Lost*, focusing on its writing, acting (particularly Zoe's performance), CGI, and plot, predicting a disappointing finale.  Upcoming guest appearances by Carly Seychild and Jade Vixen were mentioned, along with the hosts' outrage over the planned mosque near Ground Zero, criticizing President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg's handling of the situation.

The show continued with in-studio guests Bob Kelly, Geraldo, and Jade Vixen.  Jim Norton joined the hosts in discussing website issues, celebrity photos (including one of Norton with the Iron Sheik in "pissy pants"),  and the upcoming appearances of the Iron Sheik, engaging in sexually explicit and offensive humor regarding the Iron Sheik's wrestling persona and sexuality. Opie promoted his stand-up shows and revealed a sexually suggestive stomach tattoo.  The "Cherry Darts" segment was previewed, along with sexually explicit jokes about the contestants, including a same-sex female couple.  Offensive jokes targeting Elena Kagan's Supreme Court nomination followed, along with criticism of Bob Kelly's iPad promotion and an anecdote about its disappearance. Clips from previous "Cherry Darts" segments were played, alongside mentions of a lawyer with cerebral palsy accused of sexual harassment and "Rent Boy Lucian."  A highly inappropriate and sexually explicit review of *Sex and the City 2* then ensued.  Greg Giraldo joined the conversation, sharing humorous anecdotes, including a story involving a police report and a possibly suicidal girlfriend, with further sexually explicit and offensive jokes.

Bobby Kelly joined the discussion, detailing his history of infidelity ("serial killer shit," including keeping "souvenirs"), his reluctant marriage, and subsequent addictions (including a Mont Blanc pen obsession). Jim Norton shared his experiences with relationships and infidelity, along with an anecdote about Bobby Kelly startling him by banging on his car window.  Both hosts and guests frequently used vulgar and sexually explicit language. The segment also included promotions for their upcoming comedy shows.  The show then featured a discussion of bizarre Japanese and Spanish game show clips showcasing graphic accidents and stunts, transitioning into a comparison of Japanese and German cultures post-World War II.  This segued into a discussion about diet, exercise, and bowel movements, touching upon vegetarianism and veganism. The hosts and a caller shared their smoking histories and experiences with hookahs, followed by a discussion about their cell phone photo libraries, including numerous photos of their feces, and strategies to prevent others from viewing unwanted content; the impending arrival of Jade Vixen was mentioned again.


The final segment heavily featured Jade Vixen, a Penthouse model.  She discussed her career, BDSM preferences, her relationship with her boyfriend (a fellow rubber enthusiast), and her views on sexual practices, including urination.  The hosts and guests engaged in sexually explicit conversations and jokes, commenting on her physique and various sexual acts in graphic detail, focusing on her March 2010 Penthouse appearance and her latex clothing preference.  Discussions about bodily fluids, particularly urine, and related sexual acts dominated the conversation.  Jimmy Norton left mid-segment due to a prior commitment.  Promotion of upcoming shows and events, including Norton's appearance on the Tonight Show and the "Cherry Darts" segment, concluded the show, followed by a discussion on fetishes and their possible origins.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, I've got to wait for the three little drum things to go, do it, do it, do it, do it.  Then it's really showtime.  Before that, it's just relax time.  Hi, everybody.  On Opie and Anthony's show.  Opie's still out.  Of course.  He's got to take care. 
[00:00:30]  Of baby and wife.  That's what you do.  You take care.  He texted me yesterday to come see the baby today.  So, have you seen the baby?  I didn't.  Come over and see the baby.  Then he asked me yesterday.  He said, maybe yesterday you can come.  Maybe today, maybe yesterday.  But then he didn't get back to me, so I'm like, I don't know.  They sleep here?  I don't know.  When you have a kid for three days, do you fall asleep in the middle of the afternoon? 
[00:01:00]  I guess you do, yeah, because you've got no schedule or anything.  The kid doesn't know what a clock is or what time it is.  Yeah.  Used to the womb.  The womb.  Steve said he saw a picture.  Oh, yeah?  He's a big baby.  Steve privy to a picture.  Hmm.  And, uh, rumor's, uh, true?  Uh, Hudson?  Yeah.  Yes.  Is that this?  Yeah.  Hudson.  Is there a short name for that?  Hud?  Hud.  Yo, Hud.  I better be a big boy. 
[00:01:30]  He is a big kid.  Like, hey, Hud.  Hud.  I'm Hud.  Just some big football player or something.  Heh heh heh.  All right.  Hudson.  Hudson.  Steve said he's nine pounds, and he has a full head of hair.  Really?  Yep.  That was your report.  Very.  Uh, yes, Sam.  Very long baby.  Very long baby?  Yes.  But where's the photo, Steve?  You have the baby.  I know.  Um.  I don't have it.  Oh.  Lindsey sent it to, uh, MJ.  So, uh, I don't, so I didn't know if it was for public consumption, so I just left 
[00:02:00]  it.  Oh, just for us.  Well, I understand that, but I pointed it posted on.  You can't see it.  Yes.  I don't, uh, it wasn't sent to me, but I did see it, and that kid is a big baby.  We weren't, we weren't going to put it on W, W, Tyler,  Durdin, or whatever that was said.  What would Tyler Durdin do?  We were just going to look at it.  Yeah.  Comment.  Take a look and go, oh, that is our big baby.  We didn't realize that we were this, we were this much on lockdown.  I can't show the co-host.  No.  It's a secret.  You know what?  Silly me. 
[00:02:30]  I was operating under the assumption that you all had it already, so.  We might actually.  I'll check my, uh, maybe I'll text it.  Yes.  You might actually describe the baby on the air.  That would be terrible.  If it gets back to me, I'm a dead man.  Yeah.  He's a, that kid is as big out of the womb as my kid is now.  And that, which is, in terms of the physics of how a woman, Lindsay's size, got a human  being that size out of her, I don't get it.  It's like a graphic. 
[00:03:00]  Now you're getting a little personal there.  It's not.  No, it's not.  It's not.  Goodness.  I see what he means, though.  He's saying she's a small girl.  You'd expect that.  Because she really, even when she was pregnant, she wasn't massive.  Right.  She still looked really good, but just with a belly.  So you have a person that size to have a big kid.  Yeah.  First time.  That's, that's big.  Yeah.  It was boggling to see my wife, who's small, push a six pound baby out.  With the pushing and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how they get out.  Yeah, but you're too great.  Steve.  What?  They said it was really weird to see the vaginal canals.  That's not what I said, Jim. 
[00:03:30]  You're exaggerating.  I asked the doctor, what is that?  And he explained, that's the life-giving vaginal canal.  I know what that is.  Oh.  It's the thing I don't like.  I couldn't see it.  It's like when a vampire looks in the mirror.  Are you implying that I'm homosexual?  No.  Implying?  Not at all.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, is that a picture?  Yes.  Wow.  Wait.  Now, wait a minute.  You were privy to a picture?  Not me. 
[00:04:00]  Jess, of course.  Very cute.  All the ladies.  It's the women that were.  So the ladies.  You're a red-like woman.  Very cute baby.  Wow.  You got a bat phone on that Blackberry or whatever it is?  22 inches long.  Is that big for baby?  Yeah.  22 inches long.  You could say 22.  You could say 51 inches.  Two feet is big, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm trying to do it with my hands.  It's a long baby.  I don't know.  Very cute, too.  I want to see.  I'll find you, too.  I want to see.  I want to see.  I don't know how that works.  Very cute baby.  How that fucking Blackberry thing works.  A lot of hair. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Very kissable cheeks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a mohawk thing going on.  They always do that whoosh mohawk thing.  They take those first pictures, and it's just like flop.  You know?  There's no real thought in the first baby picture.  It just hears its face.  It's framed.  Click.  Yeah.  Open your eyes.  Very cute.  Yeah.  Baby.  The baby. 
[00:05:00]  Babies are, uh...  It's really weird how...  Babies have the cute, cute, like, little feet.  I like baby feet.  Little tiny baby feet.  And the little fat they have on their forearms and calves are very kissable.  Yeah.  They're like a Sharpay.  They get all wrinkly in the joints.  Around their wrist is all, like, wrinkly.  What's that about?  Meaty limbs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I sound like a band.  They would barbecue up nice. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  A little, uh...  Put some barbecue sauce on there.  Roll them around the grill.  Get some grill marks on it.  Bet it's tender.  That baby's a tender.  I've heard.  This would be the audio they played if Anthony's ever arrested for any crime.  Exactly.  And he talked about cooking and eating a baby.  They smell.  They always smell good.  It's like they have a weird smell, which makes you want to hug them.  Who said that?  Is that what it is?  Some kind of a natural thing that you just kind of... 
[00:06:00]  They do.  You smell like a clean baby that's been, you know, obviously not shit all over it.  They're adorable.  Laying in its own cracks.  Yeah, it doesn't make fun.  It's not going to smell good, but...  Yeah.  Like their hair, the top of their head.  Yeah.  A little soft spot.  Their little fat faces.  They give a little whiff and it's like, it smells like a baby.  Little chubby cheeks.  It's like puppies got a unique little puppy smell to them.  And they grow up and just become filthy doggy smell.  See, I talk to kids regularly.  I don't fuck around baby them at all.  No, huh?  No.  Right to it? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  What's a good word?  Then they don't understand that and cry.  No, not at all.  And then I get the baby talk immediately.  Yeah, you do.  I hate that everyone gets dragged into that.  I know.  I do it too.  What do you do?  Look at her face.  Look at her face.  What are you doing?  Just stop it.  I guess because the kid's in the womb and it's warm and relaxing and safe.  And not only are you ripped out, the tip of your fucking hog is sliced off.  Like some fucking Indian MD.  And then everybody's just talking at you in an adult clipped speech. 
[00:07:00]  Hello, baby.  You're like, you know what?  Let's just fucking...  I understand it.  Felt all nice floating around in the darkness.  What is this shit?  It's cold.  Stupid crib.  Yeah, the crib is nothing like the womb.  Yeah.  Crib should be like a womb.  Yeah.  Zip the kid up in it.  He's still all in the fetal position.  And maybe it was open set up, but they like to be confined.  Like they like blankets tight.  That's why you swaddle them, Jimmy. 
[00:07:30]  I didn't know that.  You swaddle the baby.  Because they're used to it, right?  Yeah.  Do you swaddle?  Do you swaddle, Steve?  I do.  I swaddle.  I swaddle.  You have to put the S at the end.  Waddles.  Waddles.  I know.  I get it.  I was going to belt you with it.  I was trying to figure out what letters to take out and then put in a couple of L's.  Oh, how about just wad?  Swallow.  I thought you said, do I swallow?  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  But no.  The implication is that I'm gay.  And that's just false.  Of course not.  You're a father now.  You're proven to everybody.  I was going to go swaddle in a bunch of flies, you know?  Oh, God.  It's for only a few minutes in there, Chip.  I didn't think you were scheduled until later.  Does that want to be traffic?  Well, that's nice.  Hudson, got some pictures out there. 
[00:08:30]  Sure.  Very good.  And MJ is bringing in Carly Seychild.  Xander.  Really?  Next week.  Monday or Tuesday.  Oh, we're going to see a live performance.  That's nice.  There's a cute baby, too.  Very cute.  Yeah.  A little cutie baby.  I haven't seen any pictures or anything.  You haven't?  No.  Why would I?  Post them all over his Facebook and Twitter.  I'm obnoxious asshole father.  It's understandable, though.  Even though I would say, I would remove father and put producer. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  But it's understandable the first few months that you, you know, come on.  I actually want to see baby pictures of my friends.  Not incessantly.  Yeah.  But, you know, you want to see a few.  Of course.  Every publicist that's walked in here has seen pictures of Xander.  Yes.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Quickly.  Of course.  Anything that humanizes us, the publicists, I'm all for.  Anytime someone says, how's the baby?  Oh, that's it.  You know.  Click.  Yeah.  A lot of pictures.  Click out all these pictures.  Yeah.  It's because I'm proud.  I love my son.  Penthouse pets that get to see baby pictures today. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That's fine.  And here, look at this.  Oh, that's great.  They'll go, oh, while they're going, oh, I want to just put my nose in her asshole.  I want to point and just go, and that's where they come from.  Yeah.  And just, like, diddle it.  And then do the oi-bidi-oi-bidi on the lips.  Oh, look at that.  Jesus Christ.  Could you get a picture of just the baby?  It's a little distracting.  What is it next to his website?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Where's the kid?  I know.  It's MJ's boobs, and she's holding the kid. 
[00:10:00]  And it's a great photo, because his little right arm is kind of up on the breast, and  he's scowling to his right, like, fucking beat it.  There's tits in the vicinity.  This is my time.  That's a great shot.  Oh, he looks like a little psychopath.  Yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't he?  Yes.  When anyone time the kid is near the tits, they want no photos taken.  A chip off the old psychopath.  What's that?  Oh.  Oh.  I wasn't calling you.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:10:30]  Well, gotta say congratulations.  I love how we do this.  Sure.  Congratulations, even though he had nothing to do with anything, to our own Trav Dog.  From my baby?  No, because of the Habitans.  Yeah.  The Habitans.  Oh, did they win?  Yes.  Yes.  What, did they come back from three?  We were down three to two.  Down?  Yeah.  Oh, and then...  Game seven.  Game seven.  They won last night.  And this is very unique. 
[00:11:00]  I didn't think this was going on, except in our wonderful country of the United States  of America.  America, but it seems in Montreal, I've tried not to call it Montreal anymore.  It's Montreal.  Because they're all Montreal.  That's how it's pronounced.  But it's an O.  Montreal.  It's Montreal.  It should be a U if it's Montreal, but I've given up on even trying to figure out Canada.  Quebec.  Hmm?  Quebec.  Quebec.  Quebec.  Quebec?  No.  It's Quebec.  And it's Montreal. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's not how we say it.  Nah.  Ah.  Ah.  No.  Well, anyhow.  Anywho.  They won.  And, well, celebrations, I guess, in Montreal?  Well, it's the biggest hockey town in the world.  Yeah, yeah.  But what I...  So the game was in Pittsburgh.  So...  Yeah.  So the Bell Center in Montreal sold all their seats to people who wanted to watch the game  in their arena. 
[00:12:00]  So was the arena full?  Yeah, there was...  It sold out immediately.  Boy, they really do enjoy it to watch it on television like that.  Yeah.  So there was, like, you know, over 20,000 people there.  So they win, and, you know, everybody, you know, goes out onto the streets to...  Celebrate.  To celebrate.  Yeah.  Because you're moving on to the next round.  And you would think you would just see Canadian hockey fans out on the street,  whooping it up, drinking some Molson ice, perhaps, just having a good old time, eating 
[00:12:30]  some of those wacky, cakey things that they sell up there that everyone enjoys so much.  I don't know the name.  You've got to go to a particular store and get these little cakey things.  Did we talk about those once?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Brownies I brought for you?  Yeah.  What were they called?  Oh, those are two-bite brownies.  Yes.  Oh, those are delicious.  The two-bite brownies.  They're eating two-bite brownies.  Well, it seems that those aren't the only brownies in Montreal because there was rioting 
[00:13:00]  in the streets and looting.  By African-Canadians, I guess you'd call them.  You can't call them African-Americans.  African-Canadians decided a hockey win means free sneakers from the footlocker.  I saw the picture.  It's just fantastic.  This young gentleman, so excited that the Canadians are moving on to the next round, that he just  had to throw a brick through a window and go into the footlocker and remove an armful 
[00:13:30]  of sneakers.  He's obviously a big hockey fan.  Yeah.  You can tell.  Big hockey fan, huh?  Yeah, because he's not wearing his jersey because he probably didn't want to get it dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's going to have to support the team for the next round.  I just don't get it.  I don't get it.  Behave! 
[00:14:00]  It's just beyond me.  The rioting and looting.  Yeah, you don't want to get all that broken glass on your jersey.  No, no, no, no.  So you've got to wear a hoodie that pulls up over your face so you can't really be seen  well on video.  And, you know, ransack a few stores.  Yes.  What's a hockey win without some ransacking?  They're very excited people up there.  Yeah.  I don't think they were at the game.  No.  I don't think they were at the video, you know, I don't think they were watching at home. 
[00:14:30]  Um, I think somebody told them, hey, uh, the Canadians won.  Let's go out and rob some motherfuckers.  Oh.  Well, that's what I see.  I'm looking right here.  They look like hockey fans.  Do they really?  They have sweatshirts on.  It must have been cold in the stadium where they had the TVs on.  Yeah, you know, we are going through an unseasonable, you know, cold front.  What's this weed shit? 
[00:15:00]  Especially in Montreal.  In the northeast.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Are you going to pretend it's not cold here?  Quebec.  Quebec.  All right, Alex Trebek.  All right.  With his pronunciation.  In Quebec.  Just because I say things correctly.  What?  No, it's like when the newscasters use the Spanish pronunciation of certain things.  Yeah.  Mexico.  Yeah.  In Mexico.  Puerto Rico.  Yeah.  When we were down in Puerto Rico. 
[00:15:30]  Puerto Rico.  What the fuck are you doing?  It's Puerto Rico.  We say it Puerto Rico.  Guatemala.  Guatemala.  You can barely pronounce the G.  Guatemala.  Your mouth can't close when you're saying it's like, Guatemala.  Guatemala.  Guatemala.  La-la-la-la-la. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  You have a fucking hot toothpick in your mouth.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Guatemala.  So were there any arrests up there?  Yeah.  I think there's like 25 arrests.  A lot for, you know, public intoxication.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's probably the white people.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's just crazy.  And what about the looting?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I would assume some arrests should have been made.  Do they have the Mounties up there?  Do they wear the red suits and the funny hat and ride horses? 
[00:16:30]  My wife tells me that's just for show.  What?  Yeah, because I always remember that.  They're not the guys that like, that's like, my word, what are you doing?  You know?  That's like their official, you know, nice outfit.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But when they're just patrolling, what do they look like?  Really?  In uniforms?  That sucks.  There's a problem in Montreal.  I'll take care of it.  His big square jaw. 
[00:17:00]  Dudley Do-Right was the guy.  What a racist cartoon that was against Canada.  It was just, of course, Sam pulls up a professional wrestler.  The Mountie.  The Mountie.  And he's dressed as a Mountie.  As a Mountie, and he had a shock stick.  Oh, did he?  A cattle prod.  A cattle prod?  Is that the preferred weapon of the Mountie?  Are they still called Mounties?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's kind of a gay name, really, when you think about it.  Well, it's probably true.  A Mountie.  I bet they take a lot of heat from that. 
[00:17:30]  So they wear regular police uniforms, and they base that silly look.  Because probably zero respect nowadays.  If you came riding up with that uniform on to a bunch of looters coming out of a footlocker,  they would just laugh at your ass.  I'm sure they would.  Throw a sneaker at you.  Yeah, Dudley Do-Right.  He was a cartoon Mountie.  Yeah.  When I was growing up, I used to watch Dudley Do-Right.  And the whole image of him with the big chin and everything, kind of racist-y. 
[00:18:00]  I think so.  For Canada.  I think it's offensive.  But we didn't care.  Yeah.  In hindsight, it's offensive.  So many things are.  Isn't it?  Amos and Andy.  Yeah.  How is Dudley Do-Right offensive?  Just a guy, right?  Canadian.  He's Canadian, and he's just dressed up as a Mountie, and he did Mountie things.  He's got the big square jaw.  I don't know.  It's almost like a propaganda picture of a Canadian.  A little good-natured. 
[00:18:30]  A little good-natured.  But the nose looks like a propaganda picture from 1936.  Yes.  A little good-natured ribbing.  Is that what it is?  Canadians were never held under our thumb.  No, no.  That's true.  Eh.  I'm sure they make more fun of us than we do of them.  We don't even give them a second thought.  Never.  We give you Canadians a second thought, unless you do something like, you know, come from  three behind and win.  First Eastern Conference Finals in 17 years. 
[00:19:00]  Exactly.  Now on to who?  Either Boston or Philly, whoever wins tomorrow night.  Boston or Philly.  Penguins lost, right?  Yeah, we beat the Penguins.  Oh, that's he beat.  Yeah.  Who looks like the better team there, Boston or Philly?  Well, Philly's won the last three games in that series.  Oh, shit.  Boston was up 3-0.  They had it wrapped up.  And Philly's forcing a Game 7 now.  Wow.  Philly's got the momentum.  A lot of Game 7s.  Yes.  Too many.  Yeah, but too many.  My nerves can't handle it.  Yeah, I see that. 
[00:19:30]  And I see you have your Dharma Initiative shirt on.  I didn't want to talk about Lost yesterday because a lot of people, they DVR it.  Sure.  Yeah.  And hadn't seen it, but I'm just assuming now that you've seen it.  So we'll talk about it.  Give people a second to turn it off.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  What did you think of the episode of Lost, Jim?  I liked what they did with it.  The acting of the, you know, is about Jacob and it turns out the guy was his brother. 
[00:20:00]  What?  The one who played the mother throughout the episode, like the one who smashed the real  mother with a rock.  Yeah.  Stunk!  Stunk!  Yeah.  They are pulling these women out of their asses that have no acting skills whatsoever.  I mean fucking horrendous.  Like her, Zoe, they have some terrible actors on this show.  Jacob Beans! 
[00:20:30]  It's just horrible.  It's just horrible.  You're right, smoke monster.  You kill people?  It was a decent episode.  It explained some stuff.  But I'm so beyond disgusted with the writing, the horrible writing and the unnecessary drivel  they've thrown at me all season.  And I'm not being fucking peat picky.  Season five was really good.  So I don't believe that like a year later that they have to fall off the cliff so great. 
[00:21:00]  It's laziness.  Yeah, you think?  I absolutely think so.  It's mental laziness.  And I like the stuff with the regulars.  They killed off Saeed, Sun, Jin, and Lapidus.  And Lapidus was awful.  Lapidus.  But they kill off three main characters.  He didn't like Lapidus.  He was fucking horrible with his stupid Paulie Walnut's hair.  Saying all of a sudden, nothing personal.  Shut up.  Oh, that's pretty good.  But then they kill off Sun and Jin, which was a great scene. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But it almost felt...  Pretty touching.  But it almost felt like, who gave a fuck at this point?  I'm so...  There's nothing...  Has any impact.  The only stuff that had impact on me this year was this flash when Desmond and Charlie met.  Yeah, yeah.  And you saw that fucking Charlie holding up that sign.  Like, that was...  That had like a real like impact.  Like, wow, that was great.  And every other season had 50 moments like that.  Yeah.  Even season five had 50 moments like that.  And this one, that was the only one.  Yeah, you think they were trying to just pump out emotion on this one? 
[00:22:00]  Like, and then having Hurley just come up on the beach and start weeping?  Yeah, maybe he read next week's script.  Yeah, I didn't give a fuck.  And I just didn't care.  Because to me, I didn't feel connected to these people for some reason.  It's like, Saeed we've been with since day one, and I understand he died a hero, but  they make him this fucking weird guy, half dead in the pool, and it's like no one gave  a shit.  He just didn't give a shit.  Yeah, that wasn't explained.  After he went in there and was dead and then came back, it wasn't Saeed.  It wasn't, you know, the character that you kind of liked watching and ass kicking. 
[00:22:30]  And then the other characters that are still kicking have kind of just become parodies of  their character.  Terrible.  Like, Sawyer is just, it's angry Sawyer all the time.  Just cocking his gun all the time.  I'm going in there.  It's like, wouldn't you have done that beforehand?  I don't like the last minute cocking of the gun in Lost.  Right when they come out of the woods with the guns, you just hear,  Like, shouldn't you have done that when you picked your gun up on this island? 
[00:23:00]  You don't know what's going to jump out at you.  Cock your gun!  It's just gotten to a point where, and the sets that they're using.  First of all, the mother with her, again, Planet of the Apes fucking clothes.  You can almost see the fold marks where they came out of the fucking box.  They were so fresh and clean looking.  It looked like they were on the set of Land of the Lost.  You didn't like that?  Did they lose, did ABC lose the entire Lost budget for writers and set, and the smoke monster? 
[00:23:30]  I understand the graphics have never been great on Lost, but they have gotten progressively  more atrocious.  Worse and worse.  It's one of the biggest shows on television, and you can't take a real sub thing and guide  it under the water.  You've got to CGI everything.  You didn't like the underwater sub CGI scene?  Holy fuck.  Look at the smoke monster.  Sam just pulled up a picture of it.  It's just...  It looks like a Chinese guy, like a Chinese fucking parade kite, but a black one. 
[00:24:00]  It stinks.  That was Mr. Echo, right?  Season two.  Yeah.  Another guy they couldn't get back on.  Him and Michelle Rodriguez probably just don't want to do it.  No, Mr. Echo, they don't want him back because he asked to leave the show, and that's why  they killed him.  Yes, but how about who gives a shit what happened before, and they're tying it up, so he's a  character, so why don't they wrap it up with him?  They wrapped up his story.  But I mean, they're showing all these other characters.  What, in the sideways?  Yeah, or in the finale they brought back.  Charlie, really quick.  Another guy they didn't show again, besides 41-year-old Walt, who I understand is now a fucking 
[00:24:30]  accountant somewhere in the Midwest, was the gay guy with the beard who took Walt at the  end of season one.  Oh, Tom?  Yeah, it turned out to be a fruit.  I wish they would bring back Tom.  Nah, why would they?  Well, there's three and a half hours left.  Maybe he'll show up.  That's it, huh?  Tom Friendly was great, though.  Tom Friendly.  Tom Friendly.  What's his name?  Tom Friendly.  We haven't seen Ben Linus in a while.  I think he'll be, well, from what I understand, last, two nights ago was the final mythological 
[00:25:00]  episode, and now it's, you know, going to concentrate on present day.  Oh, the final, like, let's see what the fucking, the island's about.  Yeah, that was pretty much.  They showed the giant steering wheel that you drive the island around with.  Yeah.  10-4, good buddy.  I started laughing right when I saw the wheel, and he's explaining, you know, that the light,  you could find it somewhere else, and he pulls the little rock out, and the light beam comes 
[00:25:30]  out, and then the wheel was behind his mother there, and all I was thinking is, that's the  wheel that Ben uses to drive the island around.  When you came out with that one, that was a lulu.  Like, I hated how this year they had the fucking, the stupid house, that Jacob wants  you to call.  There's so many fucking dead ends this year that, to me, were an absolute waste of time.  They could have spent making these new characters much more interesting. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Watch what they, again, look what they did last year.  I mean, besides, it was a brilliant.  You don't go from that brilliant, and that fucking great a cliffhanger, to just shit.  They're taking a lot of criticism for this season.  It's terrible.  Well, I'm holding off until I see the entire thing, and I can judge it, you know.  There's no way they can give me back my hours of my life.  Well, yeah, because, you know, like, I'm not a huge fan of the sideways, episode, or the  sideways scenes, but maybe in its full context, I'll appreciate it more. 
[00:26:30]  Fair enough, but it still doesn't explain.  So I'll wait, you know.  It still doesn't explain why Zoe cannot act.  Yeah.  She's terrible.  She's fucking horrible in a way, and enough with Cornball Widmore, the bad guy.  You don't like Widmore?  I do, but he's good.  He's evil.  I'm tired of him.  We have to put you where I do.  You're for your own good.  Shut up.  For your own good.  How about you fucking give some depth to the other characters?  We know him in his fucking dopey tan fucking Australian Explorer coat. 
[00:27:00]  I read an interview last night with Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, the two head writers, and  it...  Were they apologizing profusely?  Well, they said something that'll probably worry a lot of people, that they think that  the Sopranos ending was brilliant.  Look, they had to have said that to just piss people off, and get people talking, and get  them all angry.  They really enjoyed how David Chase ended that show the way he wanted to.  They best not do anything like that. 
[00:27:30]  And by the way, the fucking numbers that Curly was obsessing about for years, and then all  of a sudden, they're next to names on the cave.  What, you cheese dicks?  That's what we were waiting for?  Oh, there's a 42 next to Candidate!  Shut up!  You didn't like that?  No, no one did.  On the cave ceiling?  No!  No, I didn't go, wow, I was like, thanks for explaining.  That's what I feel like all year, thanks for explaining, because I feel like everything  they're doing is trying to shoehorn explanations. 
[00:28:00]  I feel like they're just trying to wrap it up quickly.  Well, I also think that when you write a mystery show, you're not going to be able to please  everybody, and...  How about pleasing somebody?  How about one moment this year that makes me go, fuck?  I think it's hard that when you get the answers, it's almost like, you know, the journey is  more exciting than the actual, you know, answer to the mystery.  Than the destination.  Yeah, you know what I'm trying to say?  Not necessarily, because when I found out weird stuff, like when they were going back 
[00:28:30]  in time, and they were showing you all this stuff, it was very interesting, and I loved  it.  And the Richard Alpert episode, which is overrated, only because in comparison with the rest  of the shit season, it was good, but that was very good, because it did explain a lot.  I didn't feel cheated with the explanation.  That was fantastic.  And the acting was great.  Yeah.  It was a great episode.  I mean, you know, again, compared to the rest of the season, it was by far the best.  So you didn't think the last episode was one of those kind of explain a lot of shit  episodes?  It did explain some stuff, except the smoke sucked again, and it's like, come on, you're  wrapping up one of the biggest shows in the last 50 years. 
[00:29:00]  How about you spend 50 more dollars and hire a guy who's not using color forms to do  the CGI?  It was a very polarizing episode.  Like, people online, you either loved it, or you absolutely hated it.  Yeah, that was really odd, because I...  So many people think it sucks.  I liked it.  Because of the acting, I was taken out of it, but I thought it was kind of cool that  it wrapped up some shit.  I loved it.  I thought the Adam and Eve thing was great.  Yeah, it was really good.  And I liked when they showed the old show, when they were still interesting, the fucking...  I thought the acting was terrible. 
[00:29:30]  I thought it was fucking terrible by that woman.  And they should be embarrassed to hire people like that.  It's like, come on, man.  Kate, Sawyer, Jack, all those guys are great actors.  I think the guy who plays the man in black, I don't know his name, but I think he's very  good.  He's all right.  He's all right.  And you won't get his name, by the way.  I don't care.  A lot of people do.  I could give a fuck.  Oh, that guy, yeah.  Hector.  You know what this is feeling like?  When you're watching your favorite sports team, and as the game is going on, they're 
[00:30:00]  getting further and further behind in the score.  Yes.  Wow.  And then you realize you're reaching a point where there's only three and a half hours  left of the show, and you realize, I don't think there's enough time for them to catch  up, and I think we're losing this game.  That's kind of what I'm feeling like with Lost.  It's like, there's not enough time here to make me like this where it's going. 
[00:30:30]  Like, last year when they introduced Jacob, I was a little annoyed because he was so handsome,  which really bugged me.  I'm like, they didn't need to do that.  With his perma eyeliner.  Oh, that fucking annoyed me.  But the way he touched every character, like when he fucking handed Sawyer a pen, it was  like, oh.  Oh, that guy.  I thought you were talking about.  Oh, no, no.  Albert.  No.  Yeah, Albert.  But that was great.  That whole, it was like, holy shit.  That was so well done.  It tied in so many things.  It made you like, it was like fucking great, brilliant writing.  That was a great, to show how he touched every one of them, and he fucking, he talked to Locke 
[00:31:00]  after he fell.  Like, all these great moments that made sense to me.  Yeah.  And then this year, nothing.  And I'm not having high expectations and just being fucking ultra picky fan.  The Wire season five, which was the, I thought was the weakest of the seasons, but there was  a lot of great stuff in it.  It just wasn't my favorite season.  They should go either sit down and really figure out the writing and hire some people. 
[00:31:30]  Like, they should have done this, obviously.  I can only assume they're done.  Or just have gone completely off page and have like a bad creature from the Black Lagoon  costume guy come out and just start going, rrrr.  So you'd watch it just going, what, what the fuck?  This really sucks.  Like, really suck it up.  Just have like a bunch of pirates come to the island with going, rrrr, rrrr.  I like the flesh sideways. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, it's like, to me, it's like, it's kind of creative.  I understand they're just, it's like, after a while, how many, you know, after six years  to keep it interesting.  To me, it has, might have something to do with them getting what they think they wanted.  Yeah, I, I understand that it's eventually going to, you know, mesh together and I'm, but  I am getting a little tired of all the, you know, parody of, you know, like this happened  in that universe.  So it happens in this universe with a different person and everybody's looking in a mirror 
[00:32:30]  in each episode.  You know, there's like, there's little things like in every flash sideways, that person  is looking in a mirror.  Oh, see, I didn't know that.  At one point you go back and you watch them.  At one point, everyone has looked in a mirror.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  But that's, that's really, all right, that's kind of the cool shit that Lost was known  for doing.  But there's something about the stuff on the island.  I really don't have any complaints about the flash sideways stuff.  I mean, all right, I didn't like what the Asian guy in the beginning, I thought he sucked  with the fucking pool and his awful friend who looked a little like Stern. 
[00:33:00]  Remember that guy?  That fucking guy with the glasses.  He had the weird way of talking.  I fucking hated that guy.  His name was Lennon.  He stunk.  Lennon, man.  And they're terrible costumes.  My people!  I don't care about any of your people!  You just popped on one week and then you're done.  Me and my chick watch and we laugh at the extra acting.  We watch the acting of the extras.  It's fucking horrendous.  Like, you'll watch little moments like when they'll, they'll be like, they look like when 
[00:33:30]  they, when they run.  Watch the extras.  Whenever they run, it looks like they literally started running an inch outside of camera frame.  Like, they don't, they don't run fast.  They always just come out like this.  It's so bad.  They don't give them enough running room to make it look like an authentic run.  No, it's almost like there's a bear trap behind them and like, I run, but I can't get any  momentum.  I realize I'm being a little picky there.  I'm noticing that they're not, that people aren't really searching out like these little 
[00:34:00]  intricate clues.  Like, there's plenty of websites and everything and I would look around, you'd see something  happen on the show and you'd be like, alright, now I'm going to go to a website and see what  people are saying about this and what it might mean.  And now, I'm just like, they're not giving me anything where I even give a shit to look  it up and try to see what people are saying.  I'm still doing that.  I spend hours.  Do ya?  Yes.  Way too much time.  You still have your Dharma Initiative shirt and everything too and, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  And there's no Juliet this year at all.  I know she's on another show.  She's busy.  But how do you not tie her up into a contract where she has to do your show?  I guarantee she will be back.  Of course she will.  Meet for a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  But how does that happen where you fuck the fans like that?  She was a good part of the show.  That'd be good if they can just get her, they can't even get her to go to Hawaii.  So they had to do it like the old school, like in Three's Company when Chrissy left and  it was only phone calls. 
[00:35:00]  And they'd occasionally just have her in a room going, hi, Jack.  Oh, that's right.  And they'd just have her somewhere.  Just film her somewhere on the set of whatever show she's on.  V, I think she's doing right.  Yeah.  Kind of the V alien girl behind her.  Hey, wait a minute.  Is that show good?  No.  It's terrible.  It's bad?  I haven't watched it.  I don't know.  I watched two episodes and was out.  Out!  When they showed that V premiere during the entire Lost episode. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen a fucking network do.  Yeah, yeah.  That angered a lot of people, too.  People just getting angry at Lost.  And was there any way...  Well, it was more ABC than Lost.  ABC.  Well, yeah, but, I mean, Lost-related anger.  How were they supposed to get that fucking plane off of an island?  It's a jetliner.  It was trashed.  And they were actually considering using it to fly off the island. 
[00:36:00]  With, you know, old Pauly Walnut's hair.  Yeah.  Fucking Dopey Lapidus.  Oh, he's awful.  A big door slammed right into him, didn't it?  And the way they're ending the episodes is fucking atrocious.  This is, again, bad writing.  Talk about an anti-climax.  Jin and son die.  Yeah.  And they're big characters.  And it was a very sad scene.  It was Welsh.  I thought it was great.  Although I didn't like the fact that he stayed with her.  Because what she would have said in real life is, 
[00:36:30]  fucking, get out of here.  You have to.  We have a daughter.  Asshole.  You don't sit here and hug me while I'm drowning.  It was a little selfish.  Of course it was selfish.  But it was, you know, again, floppy writing.  Wrap that up.  Okay.  Wrap that up.  Wrap that up.  Wrap that up.  Fucking.  And then they should have ended it there.  But instead, the anti-climax of these idiots on the beach,  fucking fat hurly making a sandcastle,  and then Locke in an awful wig, Claire.  And Locke's like, I'm going to finish what I started.  Boom, dong.  Ooh. 
[00:37:00]  Ooh.  I think their problem is they became so, like, well-known for those, you know, climatic endings  that they have to do it now.  But they're not doing it.  No, I know.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, they still use...  You don't have to use that music at the end of each episode.  Of everything.  When Sawyer tells Kate, I'm not going to use the plane.  I'm going to use the sub.  Dong.  Dong.  Wow.  They should have showed the entire audience going, who gives a shit?  Dong.  Why don't they end it quieter, like with the death?  I agree.  The death.  They could have just ended it just like that. 
[00:37:30]  Nice, quiet ending for that episode.  And it would have been fine.  Yeah, with maybe like a little, uh, a one moment of Saeed, one moment of Jin, and one  moment of Sun.  Let the impact.  Hey, asshole writers, how about allowing to have impact?  Six years have been with these cocksuckers.  How do you kill off three main characters and fucking me, crybaby bitch that I am, nothing?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Not much.  A little pissy-eyed?  Not enough. 
[00:38:00]  That was it.  Eastside Dave had a good line yesterday on Ron and Fez.  He said that, uh, uh, he liked the part where, where Jacob threw his brother into Marcellus  Wallace's briefcase.  It was the golden light.  Uh, I find that red-headed ass funny.  He is very funny.  God damn.  Yeah, so, um, well, you know what, though?  You're gonna watch the fucking thing.  I will.  You're not bailing. 
[00:38:30]  I'm getting less and less confident that I'm gonna like the finale.  You're gonna hate it.  Yeah.  You're gonna hate it.  They're all-  I hope I don't.  You will.  It's my favorite show.  It was.  And it's ended, and it is kind of this Sopranos feel to it where, you know, when they were  gearing up to end The Sopranos, you had watched it for so many years and knew the characters  and just knew that that was it.  That's it.  You're not seeing these people, uh, again.  I've accepted that I'm not gonna get every answer.  That's fine.  It's a mystery show.  Some things are best to be left to interpretation. 
[00:39:00]  You know, we want- I hate being left to interpretation.  But I understand that.  Wrap it up.  And I accepted that a long time ago.  Tell me.  I'm just worried that I'm not going to appreciate the ending immediately.  And this is true.  Yes, Jimmy Kimmel is airing three bonus endings, uh, on his show.  After Lost, it's three of the endings that- because they shoot a bunch of endings just  to throw people off.  So they can't say, this is it.  So it's alternate endings.  And, uh, there's three of them and they're gonna show it on Jimmy Kimmel. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, the entire cast is gonna be on Jimmy Kimmel after the show.  Oh, really?  It's gonna be a long night.  It's- it's on-  For me, for me.  Like, you're going- what are you- you're going there?  It's on- the finale's on a Sunday night.  But you're just gonna be sitting in front of a television.  How long a night?  I gotta work- I gotta work the next morning.  It's gonna be a long goddamn night.  The finale's- the finale's from 9 to 11.30, and then from 12 to 1 is the Jimmy Kimmel thing.  They're showing three alternate endings in the half hour?  What's that gonna be? 
[00:40:00]  Nothing.  Just another way to fucking- fucking sell advertising for the half hour.  Rape the faggot Lost fans in, so we all watch.  I'm not a fan of the alternate ending.  You think it's gonna be, um, serious alternate endings, or you think it's gonna be-  I don't know.  Kimmel fucked up funny alternate endings that aren't real alternate endings.  I heard he did a funny thing with, uh, with Jacob and his brother on his show the other day.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I haven't watched it yet.  Boy, he's got the fucking-  He's a very big Lost fan.  Yeah, and he's-  He's with the same network.  Yeah.  He's getting the- yeah, that's what it is. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but he's also-  He's also a big fan of the show.  What did he do with them?  I don't know.  I haven't watched the video yet.  See, that's the stuff I'm interested in.  Like, fuck the show.  What are the actors doing off-time?  What are they filming?  I actually do appreciate the Sopranos ending now more.  Do ya?  Because the- and the more time it's passed, I'm absolutely convinced that nothing was happening.  Literally, that was an insight into what it was like to be him.  Yeah.  Every fucking moment you're aware that something- 
[00:41:00]  It was almost like, as you're watching the last- we're all like, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Something's happened, happened, happened, happened, happened.  But that's what it's like to be that guy, where every moment you really are a fucking target to be picked off.  Yeah.  And every doorbell you hear, everything- we were aware of every single moment and all the stimuli around us.  Yeah, they built up-  I think that's the way it's like to be him.  You know what it is?  They built up too much drama in that last scene for it to be what a lot of people said it was, that, oh, Tony got shot and everything went black. 
[00:41:30]  It's like they built up too much drama, but doing it just for the reason you just said.  So you're like, all right, the bell rang.  Oh, who's that guy?  That guy's going to the bathroom.  Meadow can't park her car.  What the fuck's happening?  And then, boom, it just fucking ends.  Like, that's what it's like to be Tony Soprano, where literally there are a lot of people who want to kill you every day.  Yeah.  Sure, every single thing is like that fucking exasperation.  I've been able to enjoy The Sopranos now in the earlier episodes and everything in a whole new way by watching it on A&E, which is hysterical, watching how they edit the language. 
[00:42:00]  It is so bad.  It's a fucking cable network.  What they're using.  I know.  You've got a show like The Sopranos.  It's on cable.  Why don't you play it?  No one wants to hear, you freaking, you mother freaker.  No one wants to hear that. 
[00:42:30]  It's because they're worried about the fucking cunt advertisers.  But how about this?  How about the advertisers remain relevant and realize it's one of the biggest shows ever?  Yeah.  And people obviously liked it, so they're not going to watch it and then not buy you a product.  And the language is being used by politicians and news people every other day.  You're hearing them drop the F-bomb and say shit.  Like, what's the big deal?  We're so fucking stupid in this country with language and sexual content. 
[00:43:00]  Just all a bunch of prudes.  And not by, you know, by we, I don't mean we.  Right.  We're not.  No.  We say the F-word all the time, and as far as prudish goes, no way.  No way, no how.  No way.  As a matter of fact, we've got a penthouse pet coming in today.  Do we have one?  Oh, my God.  We have a very busy show.  I hope we have more than one, because to tell you the truth, I'll be honest with you, this  girl's name here is Jade Vixen. 
[00:43:30]  I wonder if she's related.  You know, that Vixen name seems to be very popular with penthouse pets.  But she's Asian.  Now, nothing against you Asians, except for that left lane at 40 miles an hour thing.  But I'm not really into Asian girls, so I'm not going to be able to look at her and gawk 
[00:44:00]  and get all giddy and try to, you know, score a date with her.  I don't have any, I don't have a fetish for Asian girls, but they can be very beautiful.  I mean, I've been attracted to Asian girls before.  They can be in a, I don't know, just regular white girls with regular all-American features.  That's what I like.  You're all-American cheerleader type gal.  Not this exotic look. 
[00:44:30]  I'm not into it, but so she's going to come in and, yeah, maybe another girl?  That'd be nice.  Are you looking?  Have we got another girl?  No, I was looking for Kenny's number so I could text him and ask where my blueberries are.  By the way, there's a great article today in the Post, which has been annoying me since  I've been perusing it as we've been talking.  Andrea Pizer.  She can be really irritating or she can write great.  Sometimes she just...  You've hated her.  Yeah, yeah, and I've also agreed with her a lot.  She kind of covers the whole... 
[00:45:00]  There's going to be a mosque built at ground zero.  Yeah, this story came out about a week ago.  I saw this and, um, wow.  Wow.  A mosque.  It's an insult.  Yep.  It is an insult.  Why?  No, I don't know.  Mosque Madness at Ground Zero.  And it's also a, a Muslim, um, center.  Like a, a Muslim history center. 
[00:45:30]  So you could go in and, and check out Muslim history.  How about you just look at the fucking, where the, where the World Trade Center towers used  to be.  And there, there's your Muslim fucking history.  And the, the, here's the enraging part.  They're saying, they said, for us it's a symbol, it's kind of a platform that's going  to give voice to a silent majority of Muslims who suffer at the hands of extremism.  A, a, a center will show that Muslims will be part of the rebuilding lower Manhattan,  blah, blah, blah.  Here's the problem.  How about you stop with the silent majority? 
[00:46:00]  How about you stop shutting the fuck up?  How about that?  Yeah.  And maybe, you know what?  I, maybe Muslims are kind of pigeonholed and it sucks that you have to be associated with  that.  Sorry.  Be mad at them.  Don't make the victims' families and the rest of us look at that center when we know that  was the motives of the guy that did it.  Right.  Of the guys that did it.  Yeah.  What, what happens in that mosque, what is preached in that mosque is the reason that  there are not two towers, uh, in that, in that place. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I wonder how long it'll take in that mosque for at least one guy to go, as tragic as it  was, America needs to, you know, come on.  Exactly.  It's, it's, it's an insult to the, uh, the dead and to the, uh, you know, landmarks that  were brought down.  Why?  Why do we, what is, this, everybody, we were just so afraid.  We're afraid to say no.  It's predicted that that's going to be overturned by the board.  Like a partial board approved it, but it might be overturned. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  It's still a shot.  Yeah.  It's a hundred million dollar project.  And if you, if you say you don't want it and people are saying you're a bigot, fuck  you.  Of course, good.  I don't want it there.  Yeah, I am.  Don't put it there.  See what this means?  Not welcome.  What was that?  Point to the tattoo.  American History X.  Oh, yeah.  With Elliot Gould.  Yeah.  And he goes, you see this?  It means not welcome.  I'll cut off your Shylock nose and shove it up your fucking ass.  God, was he, that was a really uncomfortable scene.  He was angry. 
[00:47:30]  Oh my God.  You think I'm going to let you fuck my mother?  Yeah.  Not on my watch.  What a cock blocker.  Oh, he certainly was.  Another thing that goes hand in hand with the mosque and all that bullshit.  Obama's going to be in Manhattan today.  Thank you very much for completely fucking everything up when you come here.  He's coming in to go to the police and give them a little pat on the back.  What a good job they did in thwarting the terrorist event in Times Square. 
[00:48:00]  He's coming up to, and I think that's pretty nice to pay tribute to the police.  Who is?  Obama.  Okay.  Oh, by the way, as his administration pulls one quarter of the anti-terrorism budget from New York.  In New York.  He did that yesterday.  Asshole.  So they do that yesterday, and then today he's coming in and patting them on the back.  You fucks. 
[00:48:30]  And funding is going to South Dakota and Wyoming.  They're getting anti-terrorism funding.  And New York, which is just primary target.  They're cutting the anti-terrorism budget.  But he's coming here to give them a little pat on the back.  Thank you.  What a...  What is that?  And New York politicians, of course, up in arms.  Don't piss off about it.  Oh, good. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you, Sam.  He pulled up the hope poster.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Please.  Hope.  I hope someone else is elected in 2012.  Please.  Ugh.  It's infuriating.  Why would they cut the budget for the city that is the number one target?  And it's just known.  People...  The further they get from 9-11, 2001, the more people just forget and don't think about it 
[00:49:30]  and just, eh, whatever.  Give it to Wyoming.  Gotta watch out.  They'll try to blow up Devil's Tower because it was in close encounters.  That was good.  Bloomberg annoys me more than Obama.  Really?  Yeah.  Really fucking does.  That when he...  Hey, it could be anything people have said about the health care bill.  Oh, he is...  Asshole.  ...a politically correct douche. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, is he a fucking tool?  Just has no backbone when it comes to standing up to, uh...  Uh...  Yeah, the Islamic extremists.  He should be forced to speak, like, from a fish tank into a microphone that picks up  the audio of that fucking jellyfish.  It really bothers me.  There's just no...  He...  He's so preoccupied with this diversity.  New York is a melting pot.  A diverse culture.  Cultures of all... 
[00:50:30]  You know, you can be mad at people.  You could really be mad at people, but the only people who gets mad at are, you know,  dumb whitey and people that smoke and want to buy soda.  If I had to bet 25 cents, what a fucking...  What a wispy wimp.  What a fucking wimp this guy is.  Do you think he's gay?  Uh, my opinion would be...  There's been speculation.  Yes, I would think he was.  I also think Koch is.  But again...  Yeah.  You know, I don't care. 
[00:51:00]  Rudy was all man.  I saw him the other day at Fox walking out.  I wanted to bother him to say hello, but he was on the phone and there was guys with  guns around him looking out for him.  Gotta watch out.  Oh, I bet his security is pretty tight.  Sure it is.  Yeah.  You got a picture with him at all?  You ever...  I have one, yes.  It's a little blurry.  It's from, uh...  Oh, shit.  It's not...  It's from the same night I...  No, not that bad.  It's the same night I got my awful Charlton Heston one.  This is years ago.  I got a picture with Rudy at the Congress of Racial Equality dinner.  That night I got Rudy, B.B. King, Charlton Heston.  I had a great group of people that night, but they all came out blurry because I didn't 
[00:51:30]  know how to use the flash on the camera.  Oh, a Chuck Heston?  My Chuck Heston.  Oh.  I have it, but it's a really...  It's the worst photo I have.  Damn.  Maybe you can go to eatabullet.com, which, by the way, is up now.  So, it's still being worked on.  Paul and some other guys have worked on Eat a Bullet, so that's why I haven't promoted  it.  But they are doing a good job.  Could you see if you can find that photo somewhere?  Yeah.  Wow.  Because, you know, obviously...  What is that?  He's dead.  Yankee logo?  I didn't know that was there. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I have to call Paul and fix that.  The J-N for Jim Norton does look like a Yankee logo.  Yeah.  I didn't know that was there.  Who does your website?  I guess Paul Field was doing it and somebody else.  Really?  I just don't know.  Dumb Limey can throw together a website?  He's good with computers, man.  Oh, he's an idiot, though.  Well, beyond.  See, I had a photo.  I used to have a section called Photos That Didn't Make It.  And one of them was...  That's not there.  One of them was the Heston photo. 
[00:52:30]  It's really annoying.  Yeah.  I'm happy I got it at all, but it was a really bad picture.  That would be really annoying because, you know, there's no getting another one from him.  That's...  He's pretty dead.  Yeah.  Look at Imus.  You got a picture there with Imus.  I got that sign, too.  You have many, many celebrity pictures.  I have great ones, dude.  Great ones.  I got...  When you walk into my apartment, I got a...  Me and Carlin signed.  Me and Imus signed.  Yeah.  I got the picture of me, you open the fucking Iron Sheik with the piss all over.  With his pissy pants. 
[00:53:00]  Iron Sheik will be visiting us soon, right?  Yes.  That's what I'm hearing.  Next month.  Next month?  I'm sure he'll sit down and talk about how he will show people that he is all man.  Yeah.  And they are faggot.  Right.  By fucking them in their assholes.  I think you should discuss with him the rumors of him being gay.  Oh, really?  Are there rumors or no?  Yeah.  He does talk a lot about fucking other men in the ass.  In the asses, yeah.  He does like that subject. 
[00:53:30]  Dude, I think it's funny.  Oh.  Sorry.  I was zoned out.  I will fuck you in the ass.  I talked to Nikolai Volkov.  Wow.  A couple months ago.  And he said that he leaves the humbling and ass fucking to Iron Sheik.  Yeah.  So it's not sort of a wrestling thing.  It's just an Iron Sheik thing.  I humble him with my cock.  With my cock.  Ten inch.  Yeah.  My ten inch cock.  As he's using it to just wet himself.  Yeah.  All right.  The incontinent old fuck. 
[00:54:00]  My God.  All right.  I'm going to eat my sandwich.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a tinkle.  Jimmy's going to tinkle.  So we'll take a little break.  We have Bob Kelly in studio today.  Yes.  We have Geraldo in studio.  Jade Vixen.  And I have my Caroline's dates are on sale for June sometime.  Oh, my Caroline.  Kind of my worthless.  June 3-6.  Caroline's here in New York.  May 28th, Seattle.  And of course, the Borgata.  July 2nd and 3rd.  That's a big one. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's selling very well, too.  So thank you, guys.  Yeah.  People love seeing you there.  And you'll come down.  Incomparable James Norton.  We'll make love.  Yes.  I won't even see the show.  I'll be at the tables.  How creeped out would they be if they walked into the dressing room and me and you were  laying on the couch?  Oh.  No, just not even fucking.  Both dressed.  Like with our suit jacket to skew.  Hugging on the sofa like you'll have to hug close because you'll fall off of your  own.  Yes, of course.  Kissing each other's neck.  I don't think I want to see that. 
[00:55:00]  How come?  Oh, Ryan Keely's coming in tomorrow?  Right.  For Cherry Darts.  All right.  Yeah.  Cherry Darts is tomorrow, huh?  How many contestants we got?  I think we have a total of about six couples.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  And Hotness?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And Ryan Keely will be playing.  Yes, she will be.  Oh, wow.  And are they all boyfriend-girlfriend?  No.  Or are some just pals?  No, some...  I think the majority are, unfortunately. 
[00:55:30]  That's just how this contest usually works.  Yeah.  But there is one girl-girl couple coming in.  Not lesbians, just girls.  Well, that's good, because that's double the chance.  You know.  For you.  Well.  Yes.  Yeah.  Of course.  We should just have made girl-girl cherry darts.  Yeah.  Why have guys in here?  Just they're not allowed at all.  Just all girls throwing cherries at each other's bungholes, and then we could just shut the  curtains and lick the whipped cream out of their asses. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  That would be insertion, I think.  No.  It's licking the surface.  Here's one of the chicks coming in.  Holy mackerel.  Wow.  She's a...  That's part of the girl-girl company.  She's lovely.  A lot of women don't know this, but Anthony actually has a tattoo on his stomach with an  arrow pointing to his penis, and the tattoo says, The Pussy Caver Inner.  Caver Inner.  Yes.  Yeah.  I had to explain it a few times to the tattoo guy.  No.  Put Caver Inner.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Just put a dash between them so people know it's one word.  Hyphen.  Oh, wow.  Look at her.  Look at that.  Boy, that chick's tatted up, huh?  She's sexy?  Yeah.  She's like a silly sour chick.  What's she doing there?  Oh, she's sucking a big dick.  She does some hardcore porno.  Did I see that?  Wow.  Holy mackerel.  And she's making eyes at the camera, too.  What a professional.  She looks like she's going, Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  Do you got the picture of the girl she's bringing in?  She's coming with Heather Height.  Oh, okay. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Of course.  Of course.  I like Heather Height.  All right.  Maybe they'll win the Steven Singer diamond-encrusted iPads.  Yes.  That is the big prize.  Two of them.  Atta boy, Sam.  Keep our sponsors happy.  Two of them.  Exactly.  By the way, before we go, brief bit of news.  Everyone's saying Elena Kagan, not gay.  The Supreme Court nominee.  Oh, right.  Well, a bunch of people are speculating she is gay because she looks gay.  Are they also reporting that Steve is straight?  He's gay. 
[00:57:30]  They're all saying she's not gay.  They say that that's just what is thought by every person that looks at her.  Big, uh, why so much controversy about her playing softball?  Is that just, if a girl plays softball, she is absolutely gay?  Is that it?  Dude, on the dyke checklist, that's one through eight.  Is it really softball?  Of course.  I don't know if I've ever seen a straight girl softball player.  Especially not with the batting stance that Kagan had. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  She looked like she was fucking trying to hit a double to fucking right center field.  Yeah, she was good, that one.  But, um, yeah.  It's just, it's what you were saying earlier.  No one could just come out and say, well, because she looks like a lesbian.  She has the look of a lesbian.  Because then people would be like, oh, what does a lesbian look like?  And then you'd go, that.  Yes, exactly.  Her.  Kevin James.  Yeah, a lot of people have been, uh, comparing her to men. 
[00:58:30]  She's only compared to men.  Do you know how funny SNL would be if they had Kevin James on, do a sketch as her?  Yeah.  If he did a walk-on...  Yep.  ...as her?  Do you know how fucking, what a big laugh that would get?  They wouldn't do that, though.  Why not?  Well, I'm on his way.  All right.  All right, let's, uh...  He was snoozing?  Yeah.  Oh, Bob was supposed to be here at seven.  Oh, Bob, dude, I'm tired, dude.  You know what, dude?  Boom, you wake up, you got your iPad, you fucking apparently don't have an alarm.  He was just crowing yesterday about his iPad's alarm. 
[00:59:00]  He brought up that fucking alarm.  Dude, it wakes me up, I got it on the fucking night table, bam, I'm awake, boom, I'm going,  I'm doing things, I got my coffee, the paper, boom.  I've got an Apple, boom.  He couldn't have done a worse job selling that stupid thing.  Oh, no.  It still made me go, I could do that with my iPhone, and then I have a very light computer,  laptop, that I could do anything else I needed to do.  His big selling point was that if you're traveling, you could watch video. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, great.  And I said, cool, I have a portable DVD player.  DVD player.  Or a laptop.  He got really, really upset when he thought Danny and me had stolen his iPad.  Yes, yes.  During one of the commercial spots, Danny had hidden his iPad behind the television, and  he was very angry.  Yeah.  He was going to smash all of the CDs that are out, and Danny couldn't, he could not have  given less of a shit.  Danny was just like, yeah.  Oh, no, Bob, don't steal my Rahm Emanuel farts on Charlie Rose CD, whatever will I do with 
[01:00:00]  that one?  That's funny.  You do have a couple of good ones up there today, though.  Yeah, today we got some good stuff.  Yeah.  What we also have, I don't know how much it's going to make sense, considering that you can't  enter anymore, but we do have clips from the last time we played Cherry Darts.  Oh, that was fun.  We'd like to get into a Cherry Darts mood.  A little retrospective.  Just to get people excited about tomorrow's show.  Oh, yes.  It's going to be an exciting show.  Also, there was that lawyer with cerebral palsy, accused of sexual harassment. 
[01:00:30]  I want to hear him.  But his voice isn't messed up, is it?  Oh, boy, is it.  It's a little bit.  Goody, goody gumdrops.  All righty.  Oh, no.  Yeah, there's a lot of fun stuff here.  I hope he says something we can cut off and continue.  I certainly like those.  And if you guys want to talk to Rent Boy Lucian from that big gay scandal.  I want to hear what he sounds like, because in two seconds I'll be able to tell, all right, 
[01:01:00]  the jig's up, he was gay.  Eight by six.  Unclipped.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's a big dick.  Wow.  You don't just ignore that in a profile when you want someone to carry your luggage.  I need a luggage handler.  How big is his cock, for Pete's sake?  And half those profiles on that rentboy.com, like, it's all just dicks and abs and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Why would he go there?  There's nothing that even remotely looks legit on that website.  There's nothing that says luggage. 
[01:01:30]  Google luggage.  Rent Boy doesn't even make the cut.  Nowhere on Rent Boy does it say luggage.  There's a silverback.  There is.  American tourister.  I mean, look, I've gone to Rent Boy when I needed counsel.  But it's different.  Just someone to talk to.  That's a luggage handler right there.  The guy with the friggin' 16-pack.  I really hope that this fuckin' George Wreckers fuckin' throws himself out the top floor of  a fuckin' tall building.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Disgraced.  Fuckin' asshole.  Despised.  All right, I'm eating.  I love you.  Jimmy's peeing, and we'll be right back.  Opie and Anthony's show. 
[01:02:30]  Jimmy Norton.  Enjoying his oatmeal and blueberries.  Of which I am not a fan of either.  Oatmeal or the blueberry.  They're very good this time of year.  When they're sour and bitter, they suck.  But now they're just juicy and blueberry-ish.  I'm a raspberry blackberry guy.  Oh, those are good.  Raspberries I can understand, but wow, am I surprised.  How do you feel about the kiwi?  Oh, right.  Do you ever put blackberries on your vanilla ice cream and then just boo? 
[01:03:00]  I don't like putting them together.  Right outside the Midtown Tunnel, there's a billboard up for a fantastic new movie.  Sex and the City 2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sequel came out.  And I have not seen more photoshopping done to this giant billboard.  I passed it by.  I couldn't recognize.  I thought they had recast it like Star Trek.  I swear to God, they were not the same girls. 
[01:03:30]  They made them look 20 years younger.  Really?  Really?  Ugh.  Just this big billboard and looking all glamorous.  I've seen the trailers for this.  But it looks worse than the original one, which was worse than, I guess, the TV series, which  I never watched, by the way. 
[01:04:00]  Never say you watched that.  Or you're a homosexual.  Homo.  Ah.  That music would come.  Sometimes you can't get the channel off your TV fast enough when that goddamn fucking  music would come on.  Yeah.  Like, where's the remote?  No!  No!  Oh!  Some good old-fashioned gal talk. 
[01:04:30]  And they're just, I guess they go to the Caribbean or something.  They go to a little resort area and discuss things like marriage and romance and their  lives.  And again, Samantha is just talking about her big old stretched out pussy getting pounded  by everything with a cock.  Hopefully, when they're in the Caribbean, they all have sex with Joran Vandersloot. 
[01:05:00]  And they wind up fucking two Indian brothers.  And all of a sudden, they wind up missing.  Like, that's Holloway girl.  Yes.  Four headless cadavers found floating with giant vagus.  No, they go to, like, Egypt, someone's saying.  Do they go to Egypt?  I think they go to Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi?  Wow.  What the fuck is they doing?  Why?  Because it's, like, trendy, kind of, it's a resort thing that's kind of, the elite go 
[01:05:30]  there.  And what do they do?  What?  You want to watch a trailer?  Want to check it out?  Do I?  All right.  Can I guess what it's about before we do it?  Please.  I want to see if I'm right.  Okay.  They go to Abu Dhabi because they're meeting with Israeli agents because they want to knock  off another member of Hamas.  Okay.  And Sarah Jessica Parker, they're going to do a Trojan horse thing where she's going to  walk in and they're all going to hide in her vag like a horse.  They'll think it's a horse statue because it's her. 
[01:06:00]  And they're all going to fall out with vag slime on them and kill terrorists.  Samantha will give them all an STD that will affect them in 24 hours.  It's real time.  She just kills them all with scabies.  All right.  Yeah.  Let me hear the trailer.  This sounds good.  Yeah, it is New Year.  Ah, Jay-Z.  New Year.  New Year's.  Happy anniversary. 
[01:06:30]  Me and you.  Just us two.  And in two years, amazing things can happen.  Amazing.  I never make it.  Really?  You're driving me crazy.  I've kicked my body into thinking it's younger.  How are you going to swallow all those?  Have we met?  That was funny.  A bunch of pills.  She has a bunch of pills because, you know, she's probably got to deal with her hormone 
[01:07:00]  issues.  So she's got a bunch of pills and she's taking them.  And, and, and her friend goes, you know, are you going to swallow all those?  And she looked at her like, huh?  You know me?  Because.  The cum.  The cock and the cum.  All the jizz that she swallowed.  She has swallowed so much cock that pills are nothing.  No.  Nothing to her.  Gallons of cum.  That's good.  You guys have missed.  She should actually put it in a blender and whip it up with some fucking sour yogurt  and salt.  You're right.  I wish that's not what it meant.  They were, they were all Valtrex. 
[01:07:30]  And she's implying that her, her fucking vag looks like it has fucking vitiligo, but with  red stuff.  Her pussy looks like someone put tape on it.  Just ripped skin off in eight different places.  That fucking herpetic monster.  Oh, that's so funny though.  She, uh, swallows.  All right.  And we're just at the beginning of the trailer.  And I got it.  He's six seconds in.  A hoot joke like that.  We met.  As for me, Big and I were somewhere between wild sex and a baby. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know which is worse.  Samantha.  The baby will tire eventually.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  See, they're in a hotel, right?  And they're next to, and Carrie and Big.  Big.  They're next to Samantha's room.  And, and there's a baby crying, I guess.  Well, that's her other friend.  Her other friend.  The brunette.  And Samantha's in the other room without a baby, but she's fucking. 
[01:08:30]  They're in between.  She's fucking.  And she goes, I don't know which is worse.  And, and she goes, Samantha, because the baby will eventually tire.  Meaning this old slut bag can fuck all night.  And the baby can't.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That's not it.  That's not it.  Oh, I get it.  See, she's, the headboard was hitting the, the wall. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, God.  This, this looks funny.  I hope that was.  Two Samantha fuck jokes.  I hope that wasn't her having sex.  I hope it was hitting the headboard because she was being strangled by an orderly or baggage  handler with her own stockings.  She was trying to get away.  They all think she's fucking and her lifeblood is being squeezed out of her by fucking Caribbean  fingers.  Dark fingers that were making beads earlier in the day.  They have fucking sand on them.  Oh, all ashy knuckles. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  Guy looks like Don Cheadle just yelling white cunt as he chokes her.  No lubrication whatsoever.  Another pill for that.  It's good.  Big and I are getting a little too Mr. and Mrs. Mary.  We have to work on the sparkle.  Sparkle.  And just when you think you've seen it all, you're wearing white.  Like a virgin.  What happens after you say I do?  I think we need some glamour.  One week in Abu Dhabi, all expenses paid for all four of us. 
[01:10:00]  Get out of town.  My point exactly.  I can hear the decadence calling.  Oh, you can hear the decadence calling.  Oh, a nice unclipped Arab cock.  Yes.  Oh, look, he's yelling Allah Akbar on the bus with us.  Wonder what that means.  I bet it means he wants cock or pussy.  I fucked up.  Oh, Jim.  I'll put the mic over here.  Oh, God.  Let's see what kind of hijinks they get into in Abu Dhabi. 
[01:10:30]  I bet Sam is fucking something.  Yeah, the fucking camel.  Yeah, or that new building they just put up.  Fucking Dubai.  I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.  Hold on.  Can you pause that?  That would be funny.  I don't think we're in Kansas anymore if there was a woman with a burka being beaten by a guy with a stick.  I don't think we're in Kansas.  Who's that?  Oh, she's a rape victim and they're throwing rocks at her. 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  Oh, that would be great if Samantha just got stoned to death in this movie because of her sexual prowess.  Yeah, she made one off-color joke about a tic-tac and a cock and fucking they bricked her to death.  Gave her skull.  How great would that be?  How great would that be?  Like the fucking, the fake awful mother-in-law that's just fucking giant rocks in her head.  Her fucking awful slutty face.  Boo.  Here they are.  I'm having a hot flash.  You're on a camel in the middle of the Arabian desert. 
[01:11:30]  If you're not having a hot flash, you're dead.  Oh, it's so warm.  You know what?  Also, it gets to the point that these girls, they're getting a little older.  Oh, yeah.  They're getting a little older.  But you know what?  They still got that spunk.  Yeah.  Age is a state of mind.  Exactly.  That's what I say.  Exactly.  And that's what these girls are saying.  They make a hot flash joke, but then in the next scene, she's fucking sucking off eight Arabs.  Exactly.  She doesn't care.  That's the movie.  Yes.  And then there's a funny moment at the end where she's got something on her back and they're 
[01:12:00]  like, did somebody come all over you?  And she's like, no, that was the camel.  He spit on my back.  And they'll go, oh, we thought it was cum.  And they eat it with spoons.  I'm just guessing.  I bet that happens.  Let me see your hands up in the air.  Woo!  Ah-ha!  Why is it that guys, that whole woo part was they were by the pool in Abu Dhabi and all  these guys with six packs and their shirts off, muscle man, woo back at them. 
[01:12:30]  They're all wooing like they would want them.  That's just a good point.  They would fucking wouldn't look at these women.  I actually know the answer.  Yeah?  Because the guys didn't know they were women.  They thought they were talking seahorses.  And they thought it was a miracle of modern science that four talking seahorses were in  the pool.  Talking seahorse.  Not now.  Not never.  Could we get another round of champagne? 
[01:13:00]  You are fun in Abu Dhabi.  Ugh.  This is the best mirage that I've ever had.  Oh, pause.  I know what happens.  Mr. Big is kidnapped and beheaded like a contractor.  God, how great would that be?  Mr. Big is working for Halliburton.  And he gets his head cut off.  Imagine they just showed his license and his head was sawed off slowly while her and her  fucking girlfriends watched the tape eating popcorn.  Getting laid. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Talking like, I don't know you.  Come here, you.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  You don't understand.  Mr. Parker is meeting another guy in Abu Dhabi?  That's the man that Carrie dated before Mr. Big.  Oh, shit.  What's he doing in Abu Dhabi?  That's what I wanted.  That's where I wanted to see the movie.  Oh, they're not letting us know.  No.  This is very mysterious.  I think it's a stalking thing.  I think he's followed her.  She's been getting threatening fucking emails and letters and panties with dead animals in  them.  They don't show you that. 
[01:14:00]  Panties with dead animals.  Yeah, like a slug with a gun drawn next to its little head.  In her underpants.  That is a great stalker thing.  Oh, would that just say you're in trouble?  Oh, boy.  Absolutely.  Fucking panties with like a little bit of hair taped over blood wrapped up with something  voodoo-ish.  And then he's meeting her there.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  Thanks.  Ugh. 
[01:14:30]  Being a mother is hard.  I needed a break.  We bump into each other halfway around the world.  It means something.  I think you're playing with fire.  Something happened.  Oh, boy.  I know.  She said that on the phone to her husband, by the way.  Something happened and you're supposed to think that she hooked up with the new guy.  Yes.  But I bet it wasn't that.  No?  No.  What do you think it was?  I don't know.  Maybe two of her friends were killed in an elevator shaft accident.  And I think actually they just went up into an old building and the elevator governors weren't  holding and the fucking elevator crashed and they were crushed to death like the omen 
[01:15:00]  too.  One of a jackal.  I think she said something happened.  He says, what?  And she goes, my dried up ovaries just fell out of the floor.  Exactly.  They look like sun-dried tomatoes.  Are you hungry?  I'm making sandwiches.  And some Arabs came and ate them with a spoon.  Yes.  Oh, no.  They fucking picked up her dried up ovaries and did like a three-legged egg run with them.  And made weird Arab noises. 
[01:15:30]  Hoodily, hoodily, hoodily, hoodily.  That's Arab noises.  In this movie.  Close enough.  We made a deal ages ago.  Man, babies, doesn't matter.  We're soulmates.  A Jasmine in Aladdin?  Yes, sweetie.  But with cocktails.  Oh.  Like Jasmine in Aladdin.  Jasmine in Aladdin.  For some reason that little girl watches Disney movies from 1995.  Right, right.  And I guess because they were talking about going to Abu Dhabi. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And yeah.  With cocktails.  I'll take the cock part.  You can take the tail.  What a smug old lady joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With cocktails.  With cocktails, you little shit.  Fucking.  That looks horrible.  You're not going to check it out?  Just to see it, I mean.  I have not seen one episode of the TV show. 
[01:16:30]  I will not go near the movie that is out.  I've seen some of the show.  That's how I knew about the boyfriend.  Why?  Yeah, you did know.  Yes.  Kind of.  You were rattling off plot lines.  Well, I dated a girl for a while that went through a phase of watching Sex and the City  constantly when the whole series came out on DVD.  Yeah.  So I ended up watching a lot.  Yeah.  Bob's been here for an hour.  Do you watch?  Oh, Bobby!  I hate this show so much just because it's just four chicks in the city who never have 
[01:17:00]  bill problems.  They all have money.  They all have the nicest little Soho apartments.  I live in Manhattan and I fear for my life every week that I'm just going to have to sell  my place and go back to Medford.  Medford.  Yeah.  Not once they go to a dirty deli at three in the morning and get like a ham sandwich  that is like, should I eat this or shouldn't?  It's they always have money.  They're all glammed up.  There's not one.  Yeah, that's that's what I that's what I relate to is four chicks who never have a fucking 
[01:17:30]  problem except relationships.  That's what shoes to buy, right?  Yeah.  Oh, they just love talking about shoes.  Yeah, because Sarah Jessica Parker has a club foot like Dudley Moore.  She has to go to the blacksmith to get to that fucking horse face cunt.  We did get it when you said blacksmith.  They just made it mean.  I really made it mean spirited.  A horse face and a cunt right after. 
[01:18:00]  One time Sarah Jessica Parker's character got mugged.  No way.  By a white guy, I bet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Was it a white guy?  I believe so.  Of course it was.  She was most upset that the mugger stole her Manolo Balonic shoes.  Balonic?  I don't know.  I'd say the word.  Manolo Kalonic shoes?  I wish somebody else of Manolo had gotten a hold of her.  And a fucking old OJ.  Get it?  Oof.  Oof.  Belly button.  Weren't those Bruno Molly shoes? 
[01:18:30]  Oh.  Bruno Molly.  I thought you were doing a scarf face in Manolo.  Yeah, so did I.  No, you didn't.  You thought Bruno Molly, too.  No, I knew what shoes you'd learn.  I was with you.  Manolo, shoot that horse.  See, get it?  See, get it.  She's going away with her horse tail, said that girl.  My friend's wife got punched in the face in the train at two in the morning.  Knocked out cold.  Knocked in the face?  Yeah, she got mugged. 
[01:19:00]  It was a white guy.  White guy did it?  No, I'm kidding.  Of course it was a black guy.  Oh, okay.  She goes wandering.  Yeah, they never show that shit.  This stupid show stinks.  I've hated that show, like, inside.  It brings up all my wimmer.  My wimmer?  My wimmer?  My wimmer.  My women.  This guy suddenly doesn't know what to say.  He's yelling out women.  I fucking hate Chip.  Chip is grating on me.  Oh, God.  It brings out all my women issues.  Yeah.  I hate. 
[01:19:30]  I have these women issues where I'm just, ugh.  And this show brings out every single one of them.  They are every type of woman I can't fucking stand.  With hopes and dreams.  Over 15.  They're just that whole, yeah, that I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna, just shut up.  There's a video called Friends, and they're fucking hag cougar shit. 
[01:20:00]  There's a video called Funny Samantha Quotes, if you want to, please, let's see that.  Oh, is there?  If you want to check it out.  You know, since we're doing our Sex and the City 2 movie break, come on, Sam, bring it.  It's about time we touched on this topic.  It's so refreshing to be with someone who likes to fuck outside the box.  And this is my friend, Samantha.  Ah, ha, ha.  By the way, fucking outside the box, doesn't that mean in the ass?  Yeah.  In the mouth.  In the mouth.  So we have the Jones. 
[01:20:30]  How are you out?  I'm for it.  You're right under me.  Oh, that sounds promising.  Ah, get it?  Get down, get down, get down, make love.  Ma'am, can you undo your cuffs so we can use ours?  Surely.  All the good ones are getting arrested.  Fuck me badly once, shame on you.  Fuck me badly twice, shame on me.  No.  Serious.  It's all gotten so sanitary.  I mean, no smoking in bars.  What's next?  No fucking in bars? 
[01:21:00]  For that hot waiter.  This chick.  But he doesn't know it yet.  But he's doing a fuck you to the ex.  As long as he keeps fucking you, what's the problem?  I'm sorry I can't.  Don't hate me.  The motherfucker's concise.  Hi, I need something that will make a guy come in his pants as soon as he sees me.  Got it.  How about your daughter?  Yeah.  I'm not too.  Oh, God, there goes my heart on.  I'm so sick of these people with their children.  I'm telling you, they're everywhere. 
[01:21:30]  Well, I've made my point, and he's made this.  I believe we don't get to spend the last night together.  Oh.  Are you dying?  You men are crazy.  What the fuck's talking about?  I fucked that waiter at the party and he got fired for it.  So I gave him $300 the next time we fucked, and now I think he's upset.  Get down.  Get down.  She just has to have a gaping vagina.  She would...  What is she doing?  She's clawing at her clothes.  Hey, Smith, want to come over and do me? 
[01:22:00]  It's motherfucker fuck shit.  There's a shit motherfucker fuck shit situation?  I have to go to the theater.  They finally made that mandatory.  I have the fruit plate, and I'm back with Richard.  Oh, I think that's sweet.  It's not sweet.  It's pathetic how far a gal will go for a good fuck.  Oh, God, enough with her and fucking.  We get it.  God, I've been thinking, our pathetic relationship is as close to marriage as either one of us ever hopes to get. 
[01:22:30]  So I feel I deserve some sort of settlement.  Like, say, a weekend at your house in the Hamptons?  You're not invited.  I'll be having a party.  You're not invited to that either.  Oh, it's Amanda.  Call me.  Call me.  Should you pause that fucking corny, contrived shit?  You know what a guy would, you know how a guy would react to that?  Fuck you, you hag.  And then fuck her.  I'd definitely fuck her.  Why?  Look at her.  Stop it.  That mole, it's probably growing fucking hairs. 
[01:23:00]  Just take a scissor to that mole every fucking day.  Clip, clip.  Big fucking brundle fly back hairs coming out of the thing.  You got a mole that's got hair on it?  Hair on it?  Oh, come on.  No.  I'd fuck it.  You got it.  You have an issue.  Call me, bye.  Call me.  Corny actor.  Shit.  Oh, fucking shitty actor.  Let me tell you what I think. 
[01:23:30]  So corny.  You're not invited.  You're not invited.  Call me.  By the way, it's Samantha.  You're not invited.  I'm going to have a party at your house in Hamptons.  By the way, you're not invited.  I'll be fucking on your bed.  This is Samantha Calder.  By the way, Samantha Calder.  Sounds like a gay Ted Knight.  Call me.  She's horrid.  And I bet, oh God, I bet she just has disgusting corns on her feet, hammered toes, bunions. 
[01:24:00]  She was mannequin, you know.  The shit for mannequin.  And she was in Porky's.  She was in Porky's?  Yeah, she was the Lassie, they would call her, or fucking whatever it was.  Oh, oh, oh.  How old is this broad?  Oh, she's fucking old.  What year is Porky's?  80 or 81?  Like 80.  Maybe even earlier.  Imagine, does that movie hold up at all, Porky's?  No. 
[01:24:30]  It's so bad.  Are there any clips to that, Sam?  I do.  I haven't seen Porky's.  I'm going to guess 1981 or so.  There is a girl in there that I think, I'm not even sure if she was supposed to be hot.  Um, she was the one that fucks Pee-wee at the end.  Oh, with the teeth?  Yeah.  She has fucking.  She was hot back then.  Buscemi looks at her teeth and goes, what the fuck is going on?  She.  She's bad.  And when they're peering through the fucking, the whole. 
[01:25:00]  But the old guy who laughs in this, the old guy is funny.  That's the only funny part about the movie that holds up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, and, they're just so, there's so much pussy hair in that shower, you don't even  see a vagina.  All you see is fucking, like, like, they're washing toupees on their lap.  It's horrible.  They're looking through bushes.  Yeah.  Tommy Turner, Tallywhacker clip.  What is it, Sam?  I just haven't, I've.  I don't know.  I just have seen from Porky's.  That must be where he sticks his dick through the little peephole. 
[01:25:30]  And the gym teacher comes over.  That was a funny scene, if I remember right.  And grabs it.  Yeah.  That's it.  I know that cat.  Wait.  Wait.  Here she comes.  And.  What's going on?  Tommy.  Hey, hold still, man.  She's coming for it.  Are you kidding?  They're supposed to be in high school.  They're all 40 years old.  Yeah.  She's drooling. 
[01:26:00]  Hi.  I'm Polly the penis, and I just love to have fun.  Oh, she sees it.  Yes, the gym teacher.  Oh, hold still, man.  She's coming.  Miss Ballbreaker.  Oh, boy.  She really loves it.  Here she comes.  They haven't told him that it's a gym teacher.  She's almost got it.  She's got it.  This is funny.  She's pulling his cock through the hole. 
[01:26:30]  That could really.  That could hurt him.  That is really hot.  Hang in there, buddy.  Somebody get the principal, Mr. Carter.  Somebody get the principal.  She's got him by the cock.  I think this means Tommy and Miss Ballbreaker are engaged.  All right.  This clip goes on for another fucking hour.  No way.  She's got her foot on the thing, and she's pulling his cock.  That was a very funny scene.  Yeah.  It just doesn't.  Porky's doesn't really do anything for me these days. 
[01:27:00]  No.  It reminds me of back at the beginning of cable television kind of a thing, where you would  watch it on Cinema 100 or something.  Jerk off to it.  Yeah.  That square remote.  Wormatka Home Theater.  Yes.  W-H-T.  W-H-T.  And you'd watch the same movie.  Because they only play like three movies a week.  And you'd watch it.  Oh, what's on?  The Last Tango in Paris?  And watch fucking The Godfather get fingered with butter up his asshole.  He had to do a nude scene in that, Brando. 
[01:27:30]  And he said his cock, what did he say?  He said it was like a peanut.  Like, it was so embarrassingly small.  A peanut.  Being naked in front of people because his dick looked bad that day.  A peanut on the edge of a straight razor.  He had to get something in his, what did you say?  Fingered in the asshole?  Yeah, yeah.  He gets fingered in his asshole.  And the woman uses butter.  Like, takes some butter and just puts it on her fingers.  And he's got to make this, I'm getting fingers shoved up my asshole face. 
[01:28:00]  It's great.  It almost looked like when he put the orange slice in his mouth and went,  around the tomato plants.  By the way, can we, there's a, I don't, I want to make fun of somebody.  Oh.  Apparently Danny knows exactly who I mean.  Oh, really?  I want to hear this man's voice.  Oh.  All right.  Let's listen in.  See what the mystery is.  This man is accused of sexual abuse.  Although he can't control his arms, his legs, or his hands. 
[01:28:30]  He has cerebral palsy because his brain was damaged during his delivery at birth.  An aide and his father help him with just about everything.  He cannot do anything by himself.  Even to eat.  The thinking part of his brain works.  I don't often drink beer.  Chris, despite it all, managed to graduate from college and earn a law degree.  Wow.  He literally uses his head to manipulate a computer to write.  An aide works with him.  As you can see, his arms and hands... 
[01:29:00]  Whatever that was, it wasn't graceful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God damn.  He's tripping over pots and pans.  Don't you hate when...  That must suck if you have a big fucking...  A big case and that guy shows up.  Blowing through a tube.  You're like, uh-oh.  This is not going to be good.  Going to be trouble.  As you can see, his arms and hands tend to flail around.  And that's where the trouble started. 
[01:29:30]  When people get around him, you know.  Too close, he gets nervous.  And he gets scared.  And so what happens?  Your arms reach out?  Oh, boy.  So, I'm Scooby-Doo.  I'm the attorney for the defendant.  I'm Scooby-Doo.  Holy shit.  Boy, do you not want him talking for you at the end of the fucking case.  I'm Scooby-Doo.  Yes.  So his arms were flailing around. 
[01:30:00]  And he seems to have touched some girl's ass.  The judge.  Oh, the judge, right.  Yes.  And then he was singing, putting on the Ritz.  Let me hear him.  Come on, Chewy.  Amazingly, Cheecho works.  He's a lawyer here at the Taxi and Limousine Commission, where they handle cases against taxi drivers.  Last October, in the Queen's office, a TLC judge accused Cheecho of grabbing her thigh and buttocks while they were in the office alone. 
[01:30:30]  His aide had gone to file papers.  His arm moved and he hit her.  His arm moved and he hit her.  Yeah.  Did you intend to hit her?  No.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Don't talk to this guy when there's a full moon.  I told you.  I like to make a werewolf attorneys.  My name is Arthur T. Kirkland, and I like fingernail polish. 
[01:31:00]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  I am the werewolf.  Yes.  This is Teen Wolf or Teen Wolf 2.  I like to make werewolf movies.  An American spaz in London.  No way.  But apparently one of his flailing arms did touch her.  He says when he hit her, his hand hit her on the back while she was laughing, she screamed, help, help, help. 
[01:31:30]  A guy in the wheelchair cannot follow nobody, cannot catch nobody, and she ran out of the room.  The woman went to the police precinct and filed a report.  Cheecho was charged with sexual abuse and brought in and fingerprinted.  How long did that take?  Holy shit, how long would it take to fingerprint this guy?  Come on, hold still.  Oh, shit. 
[01:32:00]  They probably just dipped his hand in ink.  It's a guy, just, we'll follow you with paper.  Dip his hand in ink and put a girl there with her ass.  He could smack it to get a whole palm print.  It's like a magnet.  His hand goes right for the cunt.  That's right, the Queen's district attorney is prosecuting Cheecho, even though his lawyer has repeatedly asked the DA to drop the case.  This is one of the most stunning displays of a lack of compassion, a lack of human kindness, a lack of judgment. 
[01:32:30]  A spokesman for the DA's office told me the prosecutor believes Cheecho uses his hands.  So we met Cheecho outside of his office to check.  Could you grab me?  So you hit me, but with a closed fist.  You did hit me.  But.  Hold on.  She sued him, too.  Yeah, this guy's got lawsuits just stacking up.  This guy's screaming.  Could you grab me?  Look, you fucking hit me.  I'm still like, police. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, his voice is great.  How do you understand that?  How is he a lawyer?  Exactly.  He's not a good one.  No.  He's never won a case.  He's 0 in 800.  Closing argument.  Boo.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, the jury.  They constantly come back with guilty verdicts.  Every client.  Every cross-examination of a witness is a complete bust.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[01:33:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  This one takes a line and, like, scribbles all over the paper.  Well, according to...  Oh, can you read back the transcript?  He went...  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Spilled water, blah, blah, blah.  Ah.  This poor motherfucker.  Ah, this poor motherfucker.  And in memos presented to the DA, both his doctor and physical therapist said his muscles are very tight, mostly beyond his control. 
[01:34:00]  You think you just got on her nerves, period?  No.  Oh, I heard that.  Yeah.  Cult.  We understood that.  And they fucking take a hidden camera and all of a sudden you see him playing chess.  He's threading needles.  He's putting a fucking ship in a bottle.  Lying, motherfucker.  Doing a Rubik's Cube. 
[01:34:30]  He's speaking perfectly clearly.  He's using voice recognition software.  All right, then.  It was like 10 seconds behind you guys.  You were out of the loop.  I was way, I was 10 seconds out of the loop.  You were out of the laughter perimeter.  And I got too happy that I had a good one and I almost fucked it up.  Good one.  Voice recognition.  I'm going to go home.  Voice recognition therapy is a pretty good thought to have. 
[01:35:00]  It was just two, it was 10 seconds behind you guys.  I suck.  He would try voice recognition therapy and then he would keep talking and the computer would  just turn itself off.  Blue screen to death every time.  You come back when this idiot's finished.  We don't get it.  I need Windows.  A Mac Puck.  Same joke you just did, but switch to the competitor.  You went to Mac. 
[01:35:30]  So it worked better.  My iPad Puck.  Yeah, after we just bash the shit out of him, you got to go, ah, the poor son of a bitch.  He's threading a needle.  How difficult would that be?  It's almost impossible to do.  He would lose his eyes.  With the hands like rocks.  It's hard to do, but wow.  He's just jabbing it into his eye.  Is that what you're insinuating?  We got it. 
[01:36:00]  Old moaning pin cushion.  Jesus Christ.  He can't even hold a pen.  He has to write with a soft paintbrush so he doesn't injure himself slash and or others.  How did the guy pass the bar exam and everything?  They don't know.  They think so.  Did he mark the true or false or is this just that he spilled something on us?  Can't tell.  What is he doing?  Is that therapy?  They show a picture of him.  He's kind of leaning on this roly-poly cylinder cushion thing. 
[01:36:30]  It's a foam mat.  It's a foam roller.  Making the dumbest face I've ever seen on a person.  He's even wearing the shirt of a dumbbell.  It's a blue and white and green striped child shirt.  It's something E-Rock would wear.  You know what's funny?  I was thinking the exact same thing.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  It is.  It's like something a shirt E-Rock would wear.  E-Rock really does wear shirts that you wear to Little League games.  He wears retard clothes.  Are you guys saying E-Rock dresses like a retard?  Yes.  Like a retard. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, wow.  Even though, you know, this guy isn't a retard per se.  But you're saying E-Rock dresses like a chubby retard.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  But as far as a child would look at this guy, and in the schoolyard, taunting, you would  call him a retard, even though he's a lawyer.  Yeah.  And he seems to be a very capable lawyer.  I don't know if he seems to be a capable lawyer.  We haven't seen him do anything.  Yeah.  See if you can look up how many cases he's won.  Yes.  He won one case because the opposing lawyer shot himself while he was talking. 
[01:37:30]  So they gave it to him on default.  Janice said the defense can never rest.  He's just constantly flailing.  Yes.  Poor fuck.  Oh, look.  Apparently the defense must make a motion.  Oh, he's making a motion.  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Well, that's good.  Good for him.  Oh, he's, um...  Good for him.  Can't think of any good lawyer names.  No.  Perry Mason.  Sloth Esquire.  What's the real name?  I don't know.  He's Sloth from Goonies.  That's what the guy said.  Addressing the jury.  Hey, you guys.  I think we've ran the course with this guy. 
[01:38:30]  Boy, you bet we have.  Twice.  We're bumping into each other.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Bobby, where are you going to be?  I know you have a very exciting show coming up.  Yeah, if I can sell some tickets.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think I sold two in the last two days.  What the fuck?  I have no idea, dude.  Plug away.  I'm going to be at Uncle Vinny's Saturday night, and the number is Uncle... 
[01:39:00]  1-877-UNCLE-VIN.  1-877-UNCLE-VIN.  1-877-UNCLE-VIN.  I love it.  Don't just make sure you just tell me I got it.  I got your own plug.  I suck at plugging.  Jimmy is very good at doing plugs.  Yeah.  I love when he plugs my stuff, because it's very precise.  Like, yesterday, we had a lot of people in here, and he was able to just rattle off their  plugs and everything.  I love when he plugs my stuff, because one, he does it great, and two, they might mistake  that he's going to be there and actually show up.  Oh.  And then just, when I say goodnight, they're still just waiting, and they're like, is Jimmy? 
[01:39:30]  Like, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming down.  No, but where's Jimmy?  Do you know how many times that happened on the tour we did after tourgasm?  People showed up, because we called the tourgasm.  People showed up and sat in their seats after, like, me or Gary would switch headlining and  wait for Dane to come out.  Why?  Because they thought he was fucking showing up.  What's up, man?  Why would you call it tourgasm if...  What do you think?  Ah, to get people to show up under the guise that Dane was showing up.  Yeah.  It's all right, Greg.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How you doing?  Greg Giraldo in studio.  Sam's got to move his narrow little fucking ass and take a seat. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Hi, Greg.  Hello, Jim.  Nice to see you.  Greg's sporting more of an Eric Boghossian look.  Really?  These days, yeah.  Boghossian?  A little bit, yeah.  Well, thanks, yeah.  I've always modeled myself on him.  Yeah, really.  Boy, I didn't know Bobby would be here.  What an exciting treat, Howard.  Isn't that a treat when you walk in and the likes of a Bob Kelly-er?  Right there in the same room?  It actually is.  It actually is.  Strangely.  Bobby's fucked.  I've never seen you at this hour.  You're adorable in the morning.  You're always cute. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  They're smitten.  Enough of these niceties, huh, fellas?  What's going on around here?  Boy, tell us how you really feel.  Oh, Chip.  Chip.  I thought of fucking Chip.  Chip is, uh, Chip's really alert this morning.  Chip's an ass.  Yeah.  We all hate Chip.  Yeah, get up with the birds.  Fucking anal.  Please.  So, Greg, it's been a while since you've been on, man.  Yeah.  How you doing? 
[01:41:00]  I'm good.  Very good.  Cool.  I'm good.  You know, last time you were on, um, we had an in-depth discussion about the downward  spiral of your life.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And I always forget that we're actually on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you just gotta stop and, uh, talk about two hours about how, uh, soon my life  would be over.  But now it's all fun and games, right, everybody?  Now everything's dandy.  Yeah.  It's all like that.  Hunky-dory.  Hunky-dory-o.  Everything's going good?  Everything's really good.  Yeah.  Good enough.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think I just broke up with my, uh, with my new girlfriend-y kind of person, which 
[01:41:30]  is not good, but we do it a lot.  Girlfriend-y kind of person.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were breaking up with her.  I mean, she always tell you.  It's constant.  It's constant.  Actually, at one point, she, she, she, I thought she had, she was, she, I thought she  had killed herself, uh, because she lives, and she lives down in D.C.  And I called down, you know, but it turned out she was kidding.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Just light-hearted stuff.  I was kidding, Hylvina!  But the thing is, I didn't know what to do, and I was, I'd been up, you know, all night,  and she turned all her phones off and everything, and I couldn't track her down,  and I, and I thought, I don't know, so I finally, in the morning, I, I, it was like 
[01:42:00]  hours ago, I couldn't know, I didn't know what to do, so I called the cops in her, in  her community down, she lives down in, in Virginia, and they, they said, they sent out  cops, and they said, okay, well, we have to also, uh, you know, you're going to have  to file a report with your local precinct, because I guess to prevent harassment and  stuff like that, and I said, well, what do I need to do?  And they said, well, just call your local precinct in New York and just get a form.  They'll know exactly what it is.  Wow.  It's a form.  It's very proper.  We always do.  So I called the precinct in New York, and they go, well, I don't know what you're talking  about.  I go, they said it would be a form, you know, pride, a very firm, and they go, dude, I'm  not saying this to say it, but we don't care what happens in Virginia. 
[01:42:30]  Well, all right then.  Fucking New York.  Anytime there's a fight at one of the clubs, like, they'll just go up to both guys, you  want to, you're going to both going to jail.  Yeah.  Unless you both fucking drop it.  Shut the fuck up.  So we're like, no, it's very proper.  Everyone will know.  Any precinct does it.  It's, it's a matter of course, it's a proper form.  You guys are like, dude, I don't, we don't care what happens down there.  Really?  I mean, if she's dead, what am I going to do from up here?  Andy Griffith's being all cordial.  And meanwhile, NYPD doesn't want to fucking hear it.  So why would you think that she would do that? 
[01:43:00]  You were fighting?  I just always assume everybody kills themselves if we stop talking for any extended period  of time.  No.  Yeah, we were fighting.  We've been fighting.  You know, it's just all craziness.  You know, who knows what it is.  Did she want you to think that, you think?  Yeah.  Well, she told me that.  I didn't just make it up out of the blue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you called her your girlfriend-y kind of thing.  That's a real commitment there.  Well, that's part of the problem, I guess.  Yeah.  But you know, still, my divorce still isn't even final.  So it's, it's, it's hard to get all excited about anything going forward because I don't 
[01:43:30]  even know how much I'll have left.  All right.  So you're going through that process.  Yeah.  All right.  That explains a lot.  No, no.  I understand completely.  Yeah.  That is probably one of the most stressful, just ugh, miserable, all-consuming things  that you have to deal with.  Yeah.  Well, especially if you feel guilty about it.  Like, I felt guilty going into, you go in with this.  Why?  You felt guilt?  Well, because of, like, getting divorced and she would have wanted to stay married, I  guess.  Although she, you know, who knows. 
[01:44:00]  But, you know, I just blame myself for everything.  So I think, all right, I'll give her everything.  It'll all be fair.  It'll all be reasonable.  And then over the, like, over the course of the year, it's just mediation.  Like, you entitled twat.  You know.  Yes.  What the fuck do you think you're, really?  So you never work ever again.  And just because, because of why exactly?  Yeah.  Because you.  The lifestyle that they've become accustomed to.  They have kids, though.  Two of you have three kids.  Well, no.  But that part's fine.  The child support and everything.  But, yeah, their lifestyle they're accustomed to.  Which I always say, like, you know, it's always, what about my, what about the lifestyle  that I was accustomed to?  No, I'm not going to be able to live the lifestyle I'm accustomed to because you have  to stay with the one you were accustomed to. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  That's why I always say, if I ever get married again, I'm moving into a crack house.  We're going to live in a crack house together.  That's what you're accustomed to.  Would you ever, do you think you'd be one of those two-timers?  I want to say, no, I've always married before.  I got married when I was 23.  I was married for two years.  Oh, okay.  So this is number two.  Yeah, I'll definitely get married again.  Not that I want to, but I will.  I know I will.  Really?  It's out of your hands, man.  Larry King syndrome.  You can't, you can't stop it.  It's out of your hands.  It's out of your hands.  There are certain kind of people.  There are people that manage to have kept their perspective on women, you know, somehow guys 
[01:45:00]  like Jimmy and, you know, people who manage to not just succumb to the forces  of it.  And then there's people like Bobby who, you know, he doesn't want to be married, but  he's got no power over it.  He's right.  He's absolutely right.  I fought, I fought, I fought my wife for 12 years.  I fought her off.  No, you did pretty good.  All things considered.  Wow.  You fought a good fight.  But for me, it's like, I don't even remember wanting to be married.  I don't even remember wanting to move in with people.  And then somehow it just happens.  Clothes end up at your house.  What the fuck?  And then you can't even, it's just like takes on a life of its own. 
[01:45:30]  Were you, Bobby, were you given like a subtle or is it like a covert or overt ultimatum  with marriage?  No.  That means a choice.  I know what it meant.  I know.  Actually, I'm such a dummy.  I explained your joke too.  I know what it meant.  I know you did stupid.  Because sometimes girls are just plain come out and say, I want to get married. 
[01:46:00]  And then other times it's this, hey, she's kind of implying that if I don't propose to  her, she's fucking leaving.  No, I never got that.  That's the one that works better.  I never got that.  Yeah.  I had the ring.  I bought the, I didn't even have to buy a ring.  The diamonds.  She, her grandmother gave her a diamond collection.  So I just bought her the band.  Yeah.  It was a thousand bucks.  And then I, believe me, it was, she got a $10,000 diamond.  I just bought the band and then I threw it in a safe.  I go, when I ask you, I ask you.  So don't, it was in the safe for a year and a half. 
[01:46:30]  Then did you crack the safe with that hat you're wearing?  You look like an old school criminal.  You look like a second story, man.  You need a Lone Ranger mask to go in.  Just a little eyes cut out of it.  I'm wearing, I'm wearing a scally cap.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like an old school cap.  Hey, snake, go to the window, see?  It's either that or X-Tree, X-Tree, read all about it.  I just want to, I don't have a file of paper.  Just hold this up and wave it at me.  I'll buy it.  Now, you, getting married, though, that was your idea? 
[01:47:00]  My idea.  You said you fought her off for 12 years, but you're the one that bought the ring and  there was no inkling that she was going to sleep?  I had a bad thing.  I mean, we, we, I had something that happens usually in the marriage that ends a marriage.  I had before we got married when we were living together.  So it was like, look, either you get your shit together or I got to go.  And I was like, you know what?  I'm going to try to get my shit together.  And if it works, great.  If it doesn't, you know, then I know. 
[01:47:30]  So, and then I.  So you're talking some kind of infidelity might have taken place.  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, it usually happens when you're in the marriage.  Yeah.  Nobody cheats before.  Well, when you cheat before, I mean, what I, what I got, what I got caught doing was  like serial killer shit.  You know what I mean?  Like she found like fucking like a box like Dexter with blood samples.  You kept souvenirs.  Yeah.  I had souvenirs.  Stronger license earrings.  Yeah.  I had Brazilian necklaces. 
[01:48:00]  Fucking.  It was bad.  Fingernails.  Yeah.  A hat with blood on it.  It was just.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It was bad.  So then you decided that you wanted to keep her so you'd get married?  No, no.  I went to therapy for four years.  Oh, shit.  Was that that long ago?  Yeah.  It was longer.  It was five years now or something like that.  But yeah, I went to therapy because, you know, I've been in the program too.  I've been, you know.  Yeah.  So I know better, you know, with all this shit.  I know better.  It's like I went from this to drugs to this.  I keep switching it up like a fucking, you know, a game just like, ah, I don't do that 
[01:48:30]  anymore, but I fucking got this over here.  And then I just keep switching shit up and I, you know, I food and fucking sex and back  to food and then I'll do technology and then I'll get addicted to fucking, you know,  pens.  I got to get the best pen.  I got a Mont Blanc.  I got five Mont Blancs.  It's just stupid.  Really?  You just got addicted to pens?  Yeah, dude, I bought a fucking Mont Blanc going to Iraq and then I bought another one  coming back.  Holy Lord.  You really are rock bottom.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  But I look at how you compare it to your other shit.  That's his bottom.  No, I bought pens now.  All right, bud.  I think you're all right with the pens.  They both are going to be blowing dudes in the back for a fucking Mont Blanc.  You have friends getting together for an intervention about pens.  He can't come without five bicks shoved in his rectum.  How much are they?  The ones I bought were like almost a $300 a pop.  Wow, buddy.  They're more expensive.  You're $600 in pens at this point, huh?  You better scale out of that.  You know what the astronauts use in space. 
[01:49:30]  He has to go to PA.  Pennsylvania?  So the marriage thing, like you went to therapy.  Yeah.  But this is what fucks me up.  I see guys.  Before I got married, I would see guys like you.  I even asked you.  I'd always ask everybody who I know.  Like, you know, were you ever fucking happy?  Like, you know, like I remember you.  You were happy, dude.  I remember at a point I would see you come in and I would see guys like you and be like,  dude, that's fucking looks good to me.  That shit looks good. 
[01:50:00]  Him and his wife will be at the bar.  I remember your wife.  She was really cool.  Was she?  Well, yeah.  Back then.  I think Greg has a different opinion.  We had a decent little run when the kids started coming.  You know, like that's when things were about, there was like a three-year period where,  which is normally the hardest part with kids when they get, you know, you start having  kids, you know, you're not sleeping.  It's a nightmare.  But we had something we were sharing in common and it felt okay for a while and I had my shit  together and everything was fine.  But, you know, for the most part, no.  Like, I went into my marriage miserable kicking and screaming.  I didn't want to do it.  And it was one of those things where, like, you didn't even know consciously, like, she 
[01:50:30]  didn't manipulate me into doing it.  She even says, like, she didn't even want to get married.  Like, somehow they tricked you into it.  Dude, I was a fat.  I was, I, she didn't cry at the wedding.  I did.  I was a, and she walked up like, hey, what's up?  And kissed me.  I was a fucking, I was a pussy.  So I wanted to get married and I, I really liked.  Oh, I thought you were crying because, you know.  What?  Because I, I pretty much was crying at my wedding, but I was crying because I was like, what did  I just do?  That's a good way to spend your wedding night.  My wife's attitude was like, I got you at the wedding. 
[01:51:00]  Like, yeah, I'm cool.  What's up?  What are you doing, dude?  I think she called me dude and then kissed me.  What's up, dude?  Dude.  I'm sitting there like a tear in my eye trying to.  Boom, we kiss.  It was, it was.  You take this man, you take this woman, bam, we're married, boom.  There was no point where you fucking looked down and went, I love this.  Not during my marriage, not during my wedding.  I was actually blacked out during a lot of my wedding.  At the time, I didn't even remember, I wasn't even conscious of why I was doing it.  You know, this was just the beginning of the end.  I just got worse and worse.  But I really didn't, wasn't ready to do it, didn't want to do it, shouldn't have done it. 
[01:51:30]  In fact, when I was moved in with her, I had a sitcom, and this was in like 96, and  I was subletting her studio, and she was working on some movie in Florida.  She came back.  I was living in LA.  We weren't dating.  It wasn't even, and I had a sitcom in fucking 96.  I thought, this is not, she's in New York, I'm in LA, and I didn't want to cheat or anything.  I was telling her, you know, I don't want to have a girlfriend, I would break it up.  I'd been married before, it was too soon.  And she said, she's like, you love me.  You don't want to lose me.  You know, you don't, you really don't.  I know you love me.  You don't think so, but you do love me.  And the thought, you really think you want me with other guys? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, fuck, she didn't play that one.  But without being like two, but that's what happens.  And somehow I just thought, fuck.  You start to picture her with a guy, and you're like, fuck, man.  It becomes a possessive thing, right?  Yeah, and then you just think, well, shit, I can't handle that, so what do I do?  I'll kind of try to just more or less keep it going, and next thing you know, you're married.  But it wasn't like she consciously, I mean, yes, there were moments that I thought,  like when I got engaged, I literally just got drunk one day.  It was raining.  I got wasted.  I got on my motorcycle.  It was raining.  I had a sidewalk in front of Tiffany's.  What are you, a Billy Joel song?  Riding his motorcycle in the rain? 
[01:52:30]  You want my hat?  I might be.  I might be crazy.  And then I pulled up, and I left it there, and walked in, and just bought it.  At a fucking Tiffany's.  It was ridiculous, overpriced, stupid waste of money.  And rode back, and thought that was going to be the most romantic thing ever.  Like, I'm just wasted, drunk, soaked.  Did she cry, or she was like, you're drunk.  She was excited at the time, and it did buy a little piece for a little while.  How long were you married, man?  I was married 10 years.  Wow, okay.  Yeah, see?  Another one just hung in there.  Well, you had kids. 
[01:53:00]  The kids, yeah.  The kids then gave it hope for a little while.  And in fact, that's why I thought, you know, we did have a little team going for a while.  And then, you know, but really, in her mind, it's all because of my substance, you know,  my lifestyle issues.  You know, I buy a lot of pens.  Yeah, I know.  Those are expensive.  Yeah, again, right now I'm into mechanical pencils.  Those are hot.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even bring that up, dude.  I can't take it.  I bought a drafting table.  Well, well, well, well, guys, seriously.  I don't even know how to use this.  I bought crayons, and I molest children.  What?  I hate both. 
[01:53:30]  I'd rather fuck a crayon than a kid.  Sorry.  Yeah, see, I went through the whole thing with, like, nine years of just being miserable.  Yeah.  Just to keep the status quo and not have to go through, you know, divorce and bullshit  like that.  And then I was just starting to do radio and thought, you know, oh, good, I could throw  myself into this.  I don't have to think about the marriage aspect of it.  And then, you know, things happen. 
[01:54:00]  Someone else trots along into your life and goes, oh, okay.  And you realize, oh, okay, I'm willing to give all this up.  Yeah.  I want to fuck that.  Yes.  It is worth it sometimes.  Yeah, sometimes.  And then in the long run, they just turn the screws on you.  Yeah.  And you pay through the nose.  But I don't know why I stayed in it that long.  Like, I have no clue why I just stayed there that long without kids, without any mutual 
[01:54:30]  property.  I didn't have a house.  I didn't have anything.  Yeah.  You just start to think that that's it.  You know, this party just thinks, well, this is as good as it's going to be.  And it's, you know, it's got to take a lot of pain.  You know, if you weren't the kind of person that would tolerate a lot of mediocrity, you  wouldn't have gotten married in the first place.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I like being married.  The only thing that fucks and sucks about being married is that I want to bang on the  broads.  I mean, that's the only part.  Yeah.  That's a substantial part of it.  Yeah.  I know.  But it's not that one.  It's not the only thing that defines marriage. 
[01:55:00]  It's perfectly.  What else is there, really?  Yeah.  But I'm married, but I want to eat more lettuce.  Yeah.  It's totally fine.  You do the dishes.  I take out the garbage.  I want to fuck out the garbage.  There's other marriages out there that you can fuck out the broads.  It just defines our religion, what marriage is.  I mean, I want to fuck out the broads.  I really fucking fight that shit.  But it's like, if there's a time where my shit just dies, where I'm just dead.  Because I did a lot of fucking in my life.  I remember fucking my whole life, especially when doing drugs and all that shit, being a 
[01:55:30]  young age.  It doesn't build it.  It's not like fucking runs in one ball game and the next day they carry over.  It does.  It does.  Get out of your system.  Every day.  Get out of your system.  You're not getting it out of your system if you fucked a lot earlier.  It's not that you get out of your system, but as you get older, your hopes and dreams  just die.  You kind of just, you know, you look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, I don't want  to listen to her at a bar after a show.  I already know the scenario.  So it's like, ah, fuck it.  I'll go back to my room and just fucking play with my pens.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And draw. 
[01:56:00]  But yeah, I mean, it doesn't get out of your system, but you know how it goes.  So you play it out in your head and say, fuck it.  Yeah, fuck it.  I'm done.  I'm not going to do this.  With like movies that I've seen.  And you go like, oh, I want to watch this.  And then you play the movie real quick in your head and go, nah, fuck it.  So you do that with girls.  You think, ah, I got to talk with her at the bar.  I got to do this.  There's always those Steven Seagal movies that you'll fucking sit through no matter what.  At any point of the movie, I'll watch it.  You need the Steven Seagal of bitches. 
[01:56:30]  There's that girl that frightens me.  There's that fucking Jersey chick who's got a kind of a fucking big nose, but a really good body.  Well, you really are holding out for the cream of the crop.  No, I don't.  That's my problem.  Big nose, Jersey chick.  So you're safe.  Because what are the odds you're going to come across that?  She's a very insistent gem.  She wears a Mets hat.  She wears a Mets hat.  You know, I'm like, I don't want to cheat, but every once in a while there's that girl  from Jersey with the big nose that kind of walks, you know, if she wants her legs in 
[01:57:00]  a fire.  Look in the car next to you at any jug handle.  And you'll fucking...  Jug handle.  Jug handle turns.  And a stupid jug handle.  Make a left, you faggot.  I fucking like those chicks, man.  Little dirty, little greasy bitches.  Yeah, you like that?  Like rock and roll.  You know what I'm talking about.  I absolutely know what the fuck you're talking about.  My point's not that those are skanks, but that they're not exactly hard to come by.  You make it sound like you're okay, except for when one of these crosses your path.  One of these rare gems.  Everything is fine. 
[01:57:30]  Just occasionally a girl from Jersey comes into your path, and then what?  I always play it all the time.  Like that'll never happen.  You know the sick thing...  Every gig.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not bad if you see a girl from Utah, because you're never there.  Occasionally you bump into one of these Singaporeans.  I mean, you're playing on Staten Island.  You don't think some big-noted Jersey girl is going to be in the fucking block?  Fair enough, Ryan?  Aren't you playing on Staten Island?  Well, it was Saturday night, yeah.  Uncle Vinny's.  You scared me.  Uncle Vinny's?  That's the Uncle Vinny's in Staten Island? 
[01:58:00]  You're playing there in 1987?  I might be closing it this weekend.  It might be the last weekend.  I might be just shutting the doors this weekend.  I don't know.  I get nervous, man.  I see you guys, because you had to be happy at one point.  I'm just going to be fucking divorced.  No, you seem pretty happy, actually.  Relatively speaking, you seem really happily married.  I mean, the main thing is really loving the person, being best friends with them.  That's such a cliche, but if you really feel that, then the rest of it kind of plays itself  out.  The girls thing, because like you said, especially if you're sober, you know, the fucking chicks 
[01:58:30]  thing does get old at a certain point.  I mean, you do have to like them.  You do have to be able to listen to them.  You do have to be able to tolerate them, and that gets harder when you're sober.  So if you really like the person, you know, it kind of goes through.  But my problem is like, you know, I don't know.  This last girl, she would bring girls, she was totally cool with me fucking around.  How do you break up?  How does that break up?  Wow.  Yeah.  How does that not?  That's when you realize you're really a fucking asshole.  You go like, wow, she's breaking up.  Yeah.  Wow, she was cool with fooling around?  Not only cool with them, she used to bring, sometimes she would meet girls from AA and 
[01:59:00]  bring them around just to keep me sober.  She's not even in AA.  Is she a vampire?  You had a girl, at least she's not codependent, who was going to AA for you and meeting girls?  Wow.  No, no, no.  Fantastic.  She had friends that were like, you know, they were sober or whatever.  Like, I was doing this gig in Florida.  It was like a really stressful, like, really hard party club type of thing down at the Hard Rock  down there.  Sure.  She was coming with me, and she said, I know it's going to be hard for you.  She goes, you know, I know a friend that moved down there.  She's been sober a long time.  I'll have her meet us.  I think she'd think you were really cute, and we could all hang out.  This way you have something to be excited about. 
[01:59:30]  You don't think about drinking.  And I'm like, nice strategy.  Nice strategy.  And somehow I fucked that up.  Is she cool with you being with someone in front of her?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, part of it.  Yeah.  Part of she likes to fuck with her.  Either way.  And not even that.  At one point, I even said to her, I said, listen, you know, I said, but I'm not comfortable  talking, you know, like, if I'm on the road and she's not with me and I want to fuck  around or something, like, I don't even want it.  Like, I feel sleazy.  You know, she goes, well, you don't even have to tell me, because that's part of the turn  on.  You could just lie about it.  I thought, wow.  That doesn't make sense. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's very strange.  Part of the turn on.  You could lie.  Wow.  Yeah.  They're like, because I'm like the man, you know, like I want the man to be like so  in charge that, you know, you don't have to answer me.  And I thought, wait, but weirdly now I am answering to you.  You know what I mean?  You are telling me.  You are strangely controlling me anyway.  These fucking psychos.  They somehow find a way.  Somehow find a way.  Whatever's wrong in that relationship, fix it.  Fix it and videotape it.  Fix it.  Good sweet.  Good sweet.  Good sweet.  Yeah.  That really was one of those where I'm like, wait, what are we breaking up about exactly?  Like what, you know, we could do anything. 
[02:00:30]  And it was all because like I, you know, I had taken so long with my divorce and it didn't  look like we were going anywhere, which is ridiculous because I was.  I did think I was trying to get the divorce done and I did think we were moving somewhere,  but I'm just too fucked up.  You know, I just can't.  I don't.  I can't seem to do anything right.  The.  I just have my pens.  The whole, the whole thing with marriage and getting married, like Bobby says, you're  happy in your marriage.  Yeah.  You love your wife.  Yep.  Now that I, I, I really getting kind of disillusioned with this love thing. 
[02:01:00]  I'm not sure it's real.  I, I, I think 99% of the relationships I've ever been in have been 100% lust related.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, love is compatibility.  That's all it is.  Well, love is, there isn't, listen, there isn't a thing.  Is that on a little Hummel?  You fucking fairy.  No, dude.  It's that if you can, it's got like a little boy and a little girl and their noses are running  together.  A footer flying on one of the guy's arm and.  It's dependent I wear around my neck. 
[02:01:30]  It's just silhouettes of little kids' faces.  Love is compatibility.  No, it's not that, there's no such thing as love, dude.  It's like he said that you can be with a chick for more than three hours and not want to  fucking stab her on the neck with a pencil.  My wife can sit there.  I can be with her day after day and she doesn't get on my nerves.  We don't have to talk.  Like she'll be over there doing something.  I'll be over here for hours.  But is that the definition of love?  I mean, that sounds like you stay away from me.  I'll stay away from you and we'll be able to cohabitate.  No, no, no, no, no.  You know, I'm just saying that you can be together and not fuck this. 
[02:02:00]  All the chicks I've been with fucking 10 minutes in.  I'm like, I can't wait to fucking dump my load and leave.  I can't stand her voice.  Yeah.  How many chicks have you been with?  But then there's that chick or a couple of them that you've been with.  You're like, I can hang with this chick all the time.  So that's, there was something about your wife that transcended just fucking.  Yeah.  And we were, we weren't dating for, we lived together for like a year and we're friends.  And then we, I left, I went to New York, she went to LA and then like, we were friends  for a long time.  For 12 years, we were friends. 
[02:02:30]  What do you have friends like that with a girl?  Well, we were on and off.  Like I'd move in, we'd date and then we'd, I'd leave.  But you'd have sex with her during the friendship?  Yeah.  Then that ain't just fucking friends.  But then I'd leave for a year and she'd leave, you know, we'd talk and we'd come back.  Were you in the Peace Corps?  Being the Merchmarine?  I was.  Bumped heads there.  I was in the Peace Corps.  It was a mercy to go up and fight a war somewhere for money.  Then I'd ship out.  Never knowing whether I'd return.  You always tell us a serious conversation.  As soon as you missed her in Burma. 
[02:03:00]  As soon as you say something serious and you're like, uh, boy.  I see you.  I can feel the fucking, you guys are like, not the fucking lions, but the fucking, the fucking  hyenas are waiting for a piece to fall off.  Are waiting for a rotten piece of meat.  That's all we do.  Then you say, love is compatibility, dude.  And three light bulbs go off.  It's just, I don't, I don't get the love part anymore. 
[02:03:30]  I thought I did.  I thought I knew it.  I thought I, I, I did.  But I realized it, it came down to, I was in lust.  I liked fucking, and I didn't like the idea of her fucking someone else.  Mix it all together.  And that was Anthony's version of love.  That is the furthest thing from fucking love.  Yeah.  Oh, I want to marry you because I don't want you to fuck other guys.  Right.  And, uh, I like the way we fuck.  And, um, I'm probably going to be sick of you in a few months. 
[02:04:00]  I think it's, I'm sorry.  I've had, I've had that same sort of dynamic and that's, that's a problem.  That's a, that's a problem with us.  That's a problem with us.  Cause there are people.  And actually with like this, you know, I've had situations with girls since where I felt  like, okay, this is like a friend.  Like I, now I get what people are talking about.  Like I would just want to, this is somebody who knows you exactly for who you are.  Cause the other thing is that if you live like, like I'd lived before then, you know,  like my, my wife, she didn't know me really.  You know, she thought she had this idealized version of who she thought she loved.  And that guy wasn't the person, you know, so like, if you know, she loves this perfect 
[02:04:30]  dude, who's not that guy, then you know, that's the whole dishonest thing.  All of a sudden you meet people that really know you, that know exactly everything you've  done wrong in your life.  And they still like you.  They're like, dude, like you can meet girls that are like your friends, like a dude that's  hot that you'd like to fuck, you know, like Bobby.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, wait a minute.  I'm the guy you want to fuck.  Yeah.  That's what I meant.  That's what I meant.  I better watch how you sit around this place.  Oh, shit.  Fucking shit.  God damn it.  What do you got?  Like, cause the girl lets you, she's like, I want you to lie.  It's kind of, it's just very hot. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  So what does she get mad at you for?  It's gotta be something, there's gotta be like a trade-off on the other side.  Like, she's really cool in this direction, but is there one direction?  Well, the thing is, right, it's hard to tell, but right now it's cause it's long distance.  She lives in DC.  I live, I live here, obviously.  Well, she's got a cock.  She has a cock.  At the beginning I thought that, Bob, because she was just too perfect.  On paper, she's too perfect.  She's too perfect.  There's nothing wrong with her.  She's the hottest girl I've ever seen.  Very pretty girl.  It was, you know, like, just ridiculous, but, but, uh, you know, ultimately it was  like, I wasn't making enough moves to get my marriage done to be, you know, and she 
[02:05:30]  wasn't, and it wasn't even like she pressured me about that.  It wasn't even consciously that.  It was just kind of like, I'm not sure what it was.  It's the long distance thing, you know, like, like she, she's not going to move here until  we, you know, until we're really going to ready, ready to move in together.  But I don't know that I'm ready to do that.  And with the kids and a whole bit, it's, it's just a giant clusterfuck.  But, but I probably will regret it forever because I think that, uh, that this could  have been, you know, one of the, this could have been a bad move.  But ending it, you mean?  Well, it's not even up to me.  I mean, it's kind of like we're collectively ending it because what am I going to do?  Get divorced instantly tomorrow.  It's a big pain in the ass to go through that whole process. 
[02:06:00]  But also like, that sounds good.  Like you said, on paper, it's perfect.  But, but I think as, as what if you did hook up your, your, your living together, that  just doesn't sound like something long term that, that would work.  Well, the thing about the other girls thing is that's a minor part of it.  It's almost like, weirdly enough, once it didn't matter, it's not like every day, you  know, it wasn't like there was some rampant, crazy sex craze thing.  It was like, it was like, you know, when we're together, you know, and we, you know,  we'd go on the road together and it was always like, if I wanted her to go meet girls, she  could, cause she, she was in the girls and stuff if she wanted to be, you know, but she 
[02:06:30]  wouldn't care.  Like we wouldn't see each other that much.  So when we would hang out, it wasn't like it was a, a crazy, you know, sick orgy from morning  to night.  It was just two people hanging out, you know, when you, when you don't feel that fear that  holy shit, I'll never fuck another girl again.  And you strangely, it goes away kind of, you know, it becomes, uh, it becomes like  it's insane.  That's something I went through for years though, is the, uh, oh my God, the, this has to be  the last girl that's ever going to fuck me.  Like what, what horrid self-esteem to, to just think that.  And, and that's why the, you know, saying I love you would come out of my mouth. 
[02:07:00]  Like, do you want to have coffee?  I would just be, the second my dick came out, I'd be like, I love you.  And that just was the, the, the end right there.  The second I would say it would just be the beginning of the fucking rollercoaster of doom  for the relationship.  It would take a long time.  It was a hell of a long rollercoaster ride, but because I wasn't in love.  I fucking love my wife.  I really do.  I can cry looking at my wife.  I'm sure she feels the same.  Again, I knew, I knew. 
[02:07:30]  Wait, wait, it comes in threes.  I'm not fucking, I'm not moving on.  Go ahead.  By the way, I actually don't even feel bad.  Like this is the last girl.  Is this the girl I want to fuck me?  I actually feel worse for the woman.  It's like, I've seen myself new and I got side fat and appendix scar.  She has to look at this.  Yeah, but Don met me.  Doty tits in her face for the rest of her life.  Don met me 13, 14 years ago when I, oh my God.  When you were sexy Bobby Kelly?  Oh, he was delicious.  And now in the last, you know, five years, I kind of, hey, let's, and she's like, all 
[02:08:00]  right, well, I guess I, now I'd be going back on my, what I was saying, but yeah, I'll  stick with you now.  Does the sex thing drop off?  Yeah, fine.  See, that's the fucked up thing.  And then new girl.  Oof.  You're fucking five times a night.  Yeah.  Uh, marriage, years go by.  Uh, yeah, fuck off.  I'm going to watch the game.  I'm going to watch this.  I'm going to do something else.  I'm going to play video games.  I'm going to do that.  New girl, but you can't get your fucking hands off of her.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Although I got to tell you, I never really got tired of having sex with my wife.  Like, that's one thing that kept us going for such a long time.  I always thought like, this is actually all right.  You know, like we, we, it must mean something, you know, like all her friends, husbands  weren't fucking them anymore and all that kind of stuff.  You know, and you're like, well, we fuck all the time.  We must be in love.  I guess we are.  Maybe we are.  Maybe I was.  But that's what, like you said, what does love even mean?  What does it matter?  Like, maybe we were, maybe that is what love was for me, you know, but for some reason  it didn't, it wasn't enough.  Yeah.  I, I, I tend to think it's, and it's so stupid and sappy.  I, I tend to have thought that it was like this, you'd know this thing. 
[02:09:00]  It was be magical.  Yeah.  Oh, it's love.  Oh, this is it.  Oh my God.  And then you realize, no, it's just a combination of a bunch of things that have mixed right.  It turns into something that is labeled love, but, uh, it's not this mystical, magical connection  between two people.  Bullshit.  You're fucking, you know, you're cohabitating.  Every so often you'll duke it out over something.  You'll, you'll fuck.  Hopefully it's good.  You'll be able to tolerate each other for a few years. 
[02:09:30]  I can't, I just can't see it as, what?  Well, just love you.  Well, the whole time, Jimmy, I'm so broken.  I know.  I am a busted human.  All I'm thinking is, as you're saying this, you fuck them, you kick them out, you got  a gun out in your own house, you're out of your fucking mind.  That thing's insane.  You got to wear the gun in your house.  Someone's going to come in.  You can't ask them, you know, wait for me to get my gun.  You are right.  You know, the most of the idea of romantic love anyways is, uh, it's, it's considered 
[02:10:00]  totally sick by modern standards.  You know, the idea of like, like it's all like totally dysfunctional, crazy codependent,  like Romeo and Juliet and all these truly romantic stories that people kill themselves  over each other and can't be a part.  We can't be a part.  That's a sick, that's like, that's not, so what the fuck is love?  It definitely is this obsessive thing.  You're obsessed with a person to the point where, you know, you're not acting rationally.  That's, that's love.  No.  I mean, you gotta, my wife's a soldier, dude.  She's been with me, she's let me do so much fucked up shit and stood by me. 
[02:10:30]  She's been there.  She's like, probably the friend.  It's like.  So love is, is putting up with so much horse shit and not leaving.  Well, you get, wow, that sounds romantic.  No, but you get, I don't get it.  You're saying, you're saying it's either, or there's a bunch of fucking good shit too.  It's not just, I was, I treated, I kicked her in the fucking stomach every week and  she put up with it.  We had a lot of fucking good times.  Pen, pen shopping.  Yeah.  No, she doesn't like that.  I can't.  Fucking came home with a $300 pen. 
[02:11:00]  Why?  Why do we need that?  I bet you you couldn't, you couldn't stop using it just to prove that she was a good  buy too.  He'd probably wear it behind his ear around the house.  Yeah, I want to write something down.  Boom.  No, it's too big.  Boom.  You want to write something down.  Boom.  Boom.  You got your pen right here.  Boom.  Boom.  You got a fucking iPhone, a MacBook, everything else you can type on.  What do you need?  A phone number?  Boom.  Yeah.  The cartridge for the ink.  Shush.  The cartridge for the ink costs $20 and it runs out like every week.  I would fucking hand you $300 and then break that pen in front of you.  Really?  It'd be so worth it.  I'd peshy you in the neck with it.  Exactly. 
[02:11:30]  A good morrying with the fucking, Bob would never shut the fuck up about this pen.  Casino.  Casino.  Casino when he's jabbing him with the pen.  I was actually looking at the pen like, what kind of pen is that?  Just your pen.  Yeah, that was the best part of the movie for Bobby.  It's a fucking pen.  It's great.  Even that side of marriage is fucking depressing.  You can't buy yourself a couple pens.  She looks at it in a $300 pen and you make all the money.  You know that guy Mike Campbell from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers?  He's a guitarist from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  In Rolling Stone, last month or last week, he said he bought this new Gibson Les Paul. 
[02:12:00]  It was like a $250,000 guitar.  Jesus.  He's changing his sound.  He's a fucking rock star.  He's played with the Heartbreakers.  And he bought this guitar and it changed his sound.  It changed his whole thing.  And he said he had to clear it after clearing it with the wife.  You're a fucking rock star.  He's still got to clear it with the wife.  You know, is it okay for me to rock star to buy a guitar?  And, you know, do you think she's bringing in all the bucks?  I got a big fight about the iPad.  I was like, look, she's like, look, we don't need.  I'm like, big fucking fight.  And then I got her one.  I was like, you'll fucking get one too. 
[02:12:30]  Fuck you.  Did it work?  Yeah, she loves it.  She's sitting there every night.  I go, you like that, huh?  Wow, you really showed her.  Yeah, you got quite a strategy down there, Bobby.  I'll buy you one.  She's smart.  She knows how to work this idiot.  I have to subject to it.  I can buy anything I want.  As long as I get her something really expensive, too.  Bobby got it for me.  I'm sitting here.  Boom.  I'm done.  I'm playing through my yaps.  I got it.  She talks like that.  I'm punching her in the face.  Yeah, no.  Fuck you, dude.  She talks like that.  I'd punch her in the cunt.  I like that. 
[02:13:00]  Shut the fuck up.  I love the iPad, though.  It's all just fingerprints on it.  Looking at it, it's enraging.  You can't do anything with it.  It's all fingerprints.  Yeah.  Bugs me.  Swipe it off.  I know, but you want to watch a movie?  Swipe it off.  It's fucking annoying.  Open my laptop.  I hate the iPad.  You don't hate it.  You'll have one.  Guarantee you will.  No, I won't.  Guarantee you'll be.  And you'll teach me about it.  Yeah, what you do?  And I'll be like, you motherfucker.  I taught you that last week. 
[02:13:30]  So?  Well, I actually like being married.  Bob does.  He doesn't complain about being married.  It's weird.  I mean, I know Bobby.  But it took years.  But I've hated women for so long, dude.  I fucking.  I got cheated on.  And when I first got sober, I got cheated on by this girl.  She was fucking some dude on the hockey team.  And oh, yeah, it was bad.  Nice athlete.  Well, you were pretty Bobby.  No, I was on my second fat.  Oh, yeah.  Because I got sober. 
[02:14:00]  I was in shape because of rehab.  I was in rehab for a year.  And I came out really shredded.  And then I got fat.  Because I literally didn't know how to talk to women.  I got out of rehab.  And I remember trying to talk to this girl that lived next to me.  And I was telling her all my emotions.  Like, yeah, I mean, you know, I don't drink a drug anymore.  But, you know, God is good.  And I pray to God.  But it's not like God, God.  It's like a higher power.  Like, you can believe in whatever you want to believe in.  That's compatibility.  Dude, she fucking ran.  How fast did she get run?  Just gone.  I remember the only chick that would fuck me was the chick behind my house. 
[02:14:30]  And her pussy was so big.  It just went flip, flip, flip, flip.  And I wanted to throw up every time I fucked this bitch.  Was it big, like, meaty?  It was every time.  Flip, flip.  Every time I'd push my small dick into her.  I would love that.  It made me want to puke every time.  Just, ugh.  I love a pussy with texture.  A pussy with a story.  I like the type of pussy. 
[02:15:00]  You're a film noir pussy.  I want a pussy with a story.  The type of pussy you want to tap on the shoulder and go, come on, I've got to hear something out of you.  How did that happen to you?  Exactly.  IED.  Independent film pussy.  Yeah.  Dude, ugh.  Awful.  Awful.  But then I went on a tear until I married my wife.  I was just fucking, I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah, just fucking, fuck them.  Fuck them.  And now what do you do to quell that so you don't, because you're still, you're a guy. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You got to have the urge.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Yeah.  You do gigs.  Urge to what?  To fuck other chicks.  Oh, I, well, you have to leave the, on the road, you just go back to your hotel room.  And it's boring.  It's fucking terrible.  I'm literally, I got to go.  Oh, there are girls that come up to you and, and I would imagine there are girls that come  up and they're like, hi, and you could get the vibe that they want to, they want to fuck  you.  And you're, you're just like, the only thing keeping me from doing this is a legal binding  document that says I'm not allowed to do this. 
[02:16:00]  And a protective, and a protective layer of God's love.  Yeah.  That too.  That golden fucking coating of love.  You, the hardest thing would be, and this has happened like a couple of times, just a girl  comes up and she's like, hey, I want to fuck the shit out of you.  And you're like, come on, you joke it.  No, I'm fucking serious.  I, I don't give a shit.  I'm not going to say anything.  I don't want anything.  I just want to fuck.  I want to fuck him.  Let's go.  Yeah.  That's happened a couple of times.  Those are always the ones that mean exactly the opposite of that. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  They're psychos and stalkers and they'll stop bugging you.  All I want to do is, you know, accuse you of rape afterwards.  All I want is to raise your children.  I just want to raise your children with you.  Oh, you fucking, don't even say, that scared the shit out of me.  Oh, I just want to raise little Bobby.  What?  Oh, no.  That is the thing about sober.  Like, if you're not sober, it's crazy how fun and wild and insane the world is.  It's crazy.  When you're sober, you're like, holy shit, these people are fucking psychos.  Like, you can't, you just get me back to the hotel room. 
[02:17:00]  This is, this is nuts.  This girl's going to fucking stab me, but when you're drunk, it's like, ah, this chick's hot.  She's cool.  She really does mean just for tonight.  You know, it doesn't even take, like, years of sobriety.  If you're just out not drinking when your friends are out drinking, you realize what an unfun time it is.  You're just not having a good time.  They're your friends.  You know, there's girls around, whatever.  And you're just, they're drunk and just annoying the shit out of you.  Yeah.  And a few drinks later, you're just like, hey. 
[02:17:30]  They're great again.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, you just turned into an asshole like them.  Yeah.  But yeah, it's not, there's something just not fun about that.  I guess you've got to remove yourself from the whole atmosphere.  It's fucking stupid.  I mean, seeing people drunk and then the next day when they're just, hey, what's up, man?  That, who the fuck are you?  You have, if you.  Anthony Cumia.  Anthony Cumia.  As we laugh through the tears. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Oh, shit, Chip.  That's Chip.  Chip.  I didn't say nothing.  Just agreed with you.  All right.  Sorry.  How much entertainment do you need?  Well, you were saying something.  I apologize.  But you've got to take yourself out of the lifestyle of just, like, you can't go and hang out at a bar.  You can't hang out at a bar.  You're going to leave.  No, it doesn't suck.  Because, I mean, look, I've been sober my whole comedy career.  Yeah, we work on them. 
[02:18:30]  We're used to it.  Yeah, we're used to that shit.  But it's like, and I've been to that.  I've gone, hey, come on out.  And I'll go once in a while.  And they're just shit face.  And you can watch the night turn.  And friends start to not like you.  Some guy bumps in a, what the fuck?  And you're like, all right, I've got to go.  I've got to get out of here.  Because something's going to happen.  I'm going to be in a fight defending people I don't even give a fuck about.  And the girls are, oh, yeah.  And they start there.  Self-esteem gets fucked up.  You do like me?  Thank God.  I've liked you for so long.  The ones at the heart are the sober ones that show up who are dead sober. 
[02:19:00]  And they're just like, what's up?  And you're like, oh, fuck.  What are you doing?  And what?  Those are the psycho ones.  Those are the ones that don't drink.  Any girl that doesn't drink but still shows up and says, I don't care.  I'll fly wherever you are.  Wherever you're going to be, I'll fly there.  I don't even drink.  Wow.  That's scary.  Yeah, don't, don't, don't.  That is scary.  It's like Greg was saying, though.  You go out to some of these places and you get ripped.  And it's just, anything goes.  And it seems fun. 
[02:19:30]  It seems normal.  It seems okay.  So you watch it without that filter on.  You're like, holy shit.  That bad shit's about to happen here.  Yeah.  This is a moment away from like serious criminal shit going down.  And if you, and if you leave the situation and go home and just pass out or something, you  can wake up in the morning and go, I am so glad I didn't do that.  Yeah.  Like, I can't believe I was thinking of doing that.  There have been nights I've, I've been like driving home and thought, I'm just going to  stop at the fucking strip club. 
[02:20:00]  Just what the fuck?  You know?  And then I kind of think twice about it and go, eh, nah, it's a weekday.  I got to work tomorrow and shit.  And go home and then wake up and go, I can't believe I was actually thinking of doing that.  And I wasn't completely hammered, hammered, you know, uh, but it's, it is amazing.  The things you will consider.  Have you ever had it happen where you have that exact experience where you think, I can't  believe I thought I was going to go into the strip club, you know, and then you roll over  and there's like a stripper next to you.  Oh, wait a minute.  I did. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  When things creep back into your memory, you almost don't want them to.  You kind of like, yeah, I, oh, that's right.  I did this.  And then the chain reaction of memory starts based on what you just remembered.  And then you just go like, oh shit.  Okay.  Stop.  Stop.  I don't want to remember anymore.  Do you know how bad I would be with Twitter and texting if I was still drinking?  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  Fuck it, man.  It's just a cock.  I'll send out a picture for fucking everybody. 
[02:21:00]  Steve Blatter's getting pictures of him.  You fucking Mel.  Oh, it's my work email.  Don't you want to smell not have a penis?  So what?  You would be, yeah.  We were talking about how lucky Jimmy is that he got off the sauce before all of this technology  took off because now it's so easy to get in trouble.  And, again, we were talking about when you send a text and you hit send and you see the 
[02:21:30]  little bar going and realize the name at the top is not the name you intended to send it  to and you just, there's panic, utter panic because there's no stopping it.  It's a bullet that just left the fucking gun.  And as the thing is going, you're thinking of an excuse, how you can explain why you just  said those words to that person.  I'd love to fuck your ass.  It's not what I meant, Mom.  That's why you have to fuck, that's why you have to fuck just Amish girls.  Yeah, they don't have any.  No access to any electronics.  They don't text thing. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, the, uh, oh, yes, Chip?  I was just going to say, the Amish girl, you put it in there like you're throwing up a  bunch of butter.  That actually isn't a bad one there.  Chip, that's a little clever.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Amish chicks eat a lot of butter.  You could tell the drunken texts too when you start getting into the drunk text thing.  And, and it's, it's horrible because now there's a, a record. 
[02:22:30]  There is a fucking record of your, your communication and intoxication.  You go through your texts from the night before and you're just like, oh boy, you start out  at the top and you go, oh yeah, I was good there.  I was good.  Oh shit.  Oh boy.  By the time you get to the end, you is spelled Y-U-O.  Yeah.  There's a T in there.  You're not even spelling right and you're just saying things you probably shouldn't say  to people.  I used to, I used to actually keep notes. 
[02:23:00]  I used to keep a, you know, I would be drunk dialing or whatever and I would write down  who I called and what I thought I said.  Oh wow.  Just to keep a little journal.  Smart.  In the morning I'd wake up and go, what the fuck?  White House death threats.  Wait a minute.  That wasn't good.  That's pretty smart though.  Yeah.  Back then, well, it was, you know, learned the hard way.  After a while there's people calling, not having any idea and I'm having somebody call  you and you have to bluff your way through that conversation the next day.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Yeah.  So how was it with you?  So what we were talking about, I think we should go on it.  Yeah.  That's a good, that's a go.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  That thing.  Yeah.  Cause it did sound like a good idea.  Yeah.  Who, who'd you have a, like the other thing that had to do with that?  You start just babbling, hoping that you get some hint.  Oh, gay porno.  Yeah.  I agree to that.  I have to pee.  Yeah.  Why don't we, uh, take a little, a little break.  Just a tiny little break.  We'll come back.  We have, uh, Bob Kelly.  Bob, uh, Saturday nights.  Yes, Bugs.  Uncle Vinny's in Staten Island.  It's 877 Uncle Vin.  Buy some tickets, would you? 
[02:24:00]  I'm not going to be there.  No, people are listening.  Greg, where are you going to be?  Uh, comics here in, uh, Manhattan.  Oh, okay.  It's New York City, that is.  14th and 9th.  Wait, Thursday?  Uh, tonight through Saturday.  Okay.  Greg's a fucking great comic, obviously.  Very funny.  And I will be in, uh, Borgata, July 2nd, 3rd.  And, uh, Caroline's here in New York, June 3 through 6.  So, um, go to all of those gigs.  Yes.  And support our pals.  Every one of them.  Spend your money on comedy.  Let's go, B-Wee.  We'll be right back.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace. 
[02:24:30]  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace.  Bobby scared me so bad yesterday.  Hi, Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, Bob Kelly in studio.  Oof.  Greg Diraldo.  And, of course, the, uh, irreplaceable and incomparable James Norton.  I forgot sweet.  Sweet, tender, giant cocked Jim Norton.  Yay.  Yay.  Love adjectives. 
[02:25:00]  And, uh, Danny Ross stepping up and, uh, taking over the board.  Very nice.  Step it up.  It's more like he's sitting down on his fanny.  No.  God, Jesus.  That's hot.  Jesus.  Oh, Jim.  But Bobby did.  He fucking, you pulled an asshole move yesterday.  I, I was, uh, leaving the parking garage, so I make my little left turn.  And, uh, I'm sitting, there's always traffic over there.  So, I'm sitting, and I, I'm texting, you know?  And, when you text in your vehicle, the traffic stopped. 
[02:25:30]  So, you gotta keep looking up to make sure you're not the asshole that gets beat at.  So, I'm just kind of concentrating on text, looking up, text, looking up.  So, I'm very, you know, I'm very tunnel vision there.  My peripheral just shuts down.  And, asshole Bobby comes up to my fucking window and just goes.  It fucking bangs on it.  I turned around and made a face that cannot be described.  It was like, like a contorted, you know, fear, fucking. 
[02:26:00]  You look like Dick Clark getting lemon shot in his eye.  You really did mush the front of your face into the back of your head.  It was frightening.  I don't know why that just, I get, I do, I'm very jumpy.  Your hands turned into little midget happy hands.  Did you do jazz hands?  I did jazz hands in the window.  Dude, your elbows went into your fucking torso and it was just your hands sticking out.  Just waving. 
[02:26:30]  And, it was like a delayed reaction too because I looked and then got scared.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  No, because this is what happens.  When you get scared really bad, time stops.  Yeah, that's what happens.  So, time stops.  Time stopped and you went.  Then I went.  And you were immediately, you know you got somebody really bad when they just, you really  were angry.  I was so mad, but it was so good.  You nailed me.  Oh my God.  So, I had to appreciate that you got me, but I was so angry with you. 
[02:27:00]  I saw the whole thing happen because Bob goes, I'm going to scare Anthony.  And all I could think of is how great it would be just to see the flash of light inside the  truck.  And Bob's head and head blow off and realized that he had panicked the wrong man up in heaven.  You know what, God?  Dude.  You know what, dude?  You got your brain.  You got your stem.  Boom.  You got none.  I'm up here.  The golden gates.  Not that bad, dude.  I went up to the window.  I knocked.  Boom.  The gun went off.  Boom. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  I touched his window like it was an iPad.  Or the pearly gates.  What did he call them?  The golden gates.  The golden gates.  The golden.  I'm sorry.  You got the golden arches in the sky.  You're in San Francisco.  Your God, your God, all right?  My God, it's golden gates.  The God of my understanding.  Golden.  Yes, indeed.  I was so pissed, though.  Oof.  It was a bad move.  As soon as I did it, like, right when the first knock, I was like, he has guns.  I was very.  This motherfucker.  I was very frightened. 
[02:28:00]  Because I know you've been waiting for this moment for years.  Here it comes.  You've been waiting for something to be in your car.  Give me your motherfucking boom, boom.  No, you can't.  You can't actually do that.  What?  You can't shoot somebody?  No, no.  There are so many rules to shooting people.  There really are.  I thought it was a Samoan newsboy from the 1920s.  Extra, extra.  Yeah, there are so many rules to shooting people.  It's ridiculous.  You've got to read through so many laws.  Yeah, I was reading through the handgun booklet last night. 
[02:28:30]  And, boy, it just reads.  First of all, that thing reads like the most boring set of instructions you've ever read.  Yes.  It's like assembling something.  And I still have no idea when it's okay to use deadly physical force.  To use deadly physical force.  Because there's so many different little angles.  And like, well, you could do this except for this situation.  And you could do this except for this.  And if a situation merits deadly physical force, and you go to use it, and it changes.  Like something could change where all of a sudden, now you can't use it anymore. 
[02:29:00]  In like a split second.  So it's best to, you know, not err to the side of using it, is what it is.  Like some idiot knocking on your window and blowing his head off.  It's not a good idea.  Always best not to murder the guy pulling a practical joke on you.  Exactly.  Unless you're in Japan.  If you're in Japan, it's hilarious.  Oh, it's hysterical.  They put it on TV.  Yeah.  Laugh at it.  As they smell fucking underage girls' panties that have been shit on.  They bought a vending machine.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[02:29:30]  I like them.  Oh, Uncle Wang.  You can never tell if they're sleeping.  You see the Japanese where the guys are skiing at the top of the mountain.  They put a spa where the guys go in, and they're sitting in the chair, and the chair just shoots  them out the fucking down the mountain.  It's like, what the fuck?  Someone can get killed.  And they only have like a towel on, so as they're rolling down this snowy mountain, their  towel comes off, and now they're just nude outside.  Just scraping their assholes on ice. 
[02:30:00]  There must be no litigation in Japan, because people would be getting sued left and right.  Here in the United States, you can't do anything without getting sued.  My all-time favorite.  Bobby, if you've seen that one, you probably saw this one.  Did you see when they have these women, and they're in chairs, and they're looking at what  looks like one of those magic eye posters on the wall?  Yeah.  But there's no wall behind it, and there's just some guy in a spandex suit that's made  to look like magic eye designs.  Just bursts out of the wall and just scares the ever-loving shit out of these churches. 
[02:30:30]  I've never seen that one.  It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen.  The one that kills me is a hundred-man mob, where they just, a hundred people, they'll find  one guy walking down this lone street, and he's just, a hundred people sneak up behind  him and grab him and start throwing him in the air.  And then they leave, they all just run away.  They can't, like, how can they do things like that?  They'll come up behind the guy in a park, a hundred people will surround somebody in  like two seconds, and then they all look up and scream and hit the floor, and it just 
[02:31:00]  scares the shit out of that one person, like there's a meteor coming.  They used to do that on all the Spanish TV shows, like the Spanish version of the funniest  videos.  Yeah.  It was so fucking extreme.  It was like, ooh, what is this, look, ooh, and there's a guy in a bull, like a bull  arena, and he falls, and you just watch him smashing his skull on the way down, and he  ends up in his puddle of blood, like, ooh, that's going to be a bad day.  Yeah, this guy's sitting in a chair, and they just launch him out into the snow, naked.  You'd be sued if you did that in Colorado. 
[02:31:30]  And look, they're all laughing.  We lost the war.  No self-esteem.  That is funny.  We have no military.  We see a wedding dress, we shit.  They do like their shit videos.  They love it.  Shit videos and people getting fucked up.  These dummies.  How hilarious is that?  All those rotten dicks made even smaller by fucking... 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, getting shrinkage in the cold.  Oh, the guy was shitting on the other guy's laughing.  Shrinkage for an Asian.  Jesus Christ.  It's got to be a bit much.  He's going to hit his knee and buckle it.  And then they show the picture-in-picture of people in the studio just laughing their  asses off.  It's amazing.  You know, you watch the old, candid camera, and it was the most innocent, stupid stuff.  We took our salt shaker and put pepper in it.  Watch, laugh along as Fanny Flagg, sitting as the waitress, brings over mustard instead 
[02:32:30]  of ketchup, laugh along, it's not funny, but these Japanese fucking...  Wow.  They're staring at one of those big 3D kind of pictures, and some guy jumps right through  it.  A woman fainted.  She's on the floor, fucking dead, passed out.  Another one of our favorites is binocular soccer, where they made these helmets of turned 
[02:33:00]  around binoculars, you ever look at binoculars through the wrong way, and they're trying to  kick the ball, but they have no idea exactly where it is, they can see it, but they're  just not sure where it is.  That's hysterical.  It really is hysterically funny.  Goddamn Japanese are fucking nuts.  Yeah.  Fucking nuts.  Spanish TV's fucking crazy.  Here's binocular soccer.  Yeah, binocular soccer.  What a great idea that is, though.  Now they're describing it.  Oh, there he goes.  All right, they were wearing the binoculars. 
[02:33:30]  Looks like they're in prison.  Yeah.  Wow, that is impossible to even walk.  Look at this.  Watch this guy.  He blows his knee out.  He brought shame.  He brought this honor on his family.  Yeah.  Feet before the ball, he falls on his sword.  Touch the ball, you dummy.  That would be very hard.  And why is there a guy with a big jackass donkey head on?  Why wouldn't there be?  He's got giant ears and a giant donkey mask. 
[02:34:00]  There's just such strangeness going on.  It's a bizarre culture.  Very bizarre culture.  Like when you take away their emperor and their machine for making war, they just don't know what to do.  Yeah, they're still fucking samurais, dude.  The most fucking warriors.  I know.  Like their entire existence up until World War II was, at the end of World War II, was as an empire of conquering and respect around their empire with samurais. 
[02:34:30]  Yes, great warriors.  And now they're strapping binoculars backwards on their faces and trying to kick a soccer ball and shitting a girl in a bathtub shooting a geyser of diarrhea up in the air.  And just wearing as many different colors as they can.  Yeah.  You see young Japanese tourists just walking on weird plastic, weirdly pinked hair.  I can't look at like the young Japanese guys that go like, you get the good American hairdo.  And it's like this 80s thing going on, the spikes, and the color going on. 
[02:35:00]  Tub Girl is the sickest thing ever.  Oh, God.  Just that geyser.  And what great photography to catch every droplet.  Fucking, I love your comments.  F-stop usage.  Yes.  Very high shutter speed.  And high shutter speed.  Fuck.  That wasn't done with an iPhone.  No, my friend.  That's the second one. 
[02:35:30]  That is the explosion.  That's the worst thing ever.  Damn.  Damn.  Oh, yes, Chip.  Boy, it looks like she's having a bad day.  It certainly does, Chip.  It certainly does.  That's a crappy picture.  Oh, see, because she's trapping.  Yeah.  That's good, Chip.  Thanks.  Then you put that face on.  That's a great one.  Yeah, I don't get the whole thing.  The German culture, they had engineering, I think, to fall back on, because their engineering 
[02:36:00]  is second to none in the world.  They're very good with machinery and things like that.  So I guess they were able to fall back on that.  But you will catch that occasional German fucking chicken.  It's just that conquered nation mentality.  Dude, their scat films, their shit movies are barbaric.  German shit.  Yes.  Yeah.  This one series, it's really so funny.  It's like shot, like, there's always a circle around.  So it looks like it's a hidden camera, but it's not.  And it's always a guy taking massive fucking, like, Tom Carvel shits on a girl's face. 
[02:36:30]  It's the greatest.  Tom Carvel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like cookie puss shits?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I think just conquered nations just have this...  They take it out on each other.  There's humiliation.  They're humiliated.  Or you get somebody like Hitler that comes up and brings them right back again.  Oh, World War I, we lost it, but let's give them hell.  And, you know, even that, they couldn't just go to war.  They had to kill people and humiliate people. 
[02:37:00]  So, yeah.  That's just my little commentary on World War II.  I think you're right, actually.  Don't mind me.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  Wow.  I have gotten such flack for not taking phone calls.  All right.  So it's...  I've really gotten a lot of flack.  Why don't we take a couple of phone calls from people?  And the second one isn't good.  I will not go to the phones again.  That is how I operate.  I don't mind phone calls sometimes.  Yeah.  Sometimes the callers have nothing.  Sometimes they're terrific. 
[02:37:30]  Sometimes.  Very rarely.  Very rarely.  Very rarely.  All right.  The Japanese are so...  All right.  How about that Maryland call?  Are they going to call me to go, Jim, I just want to ask you how you do it?  How do you do it, Jim?  I have to know.  I've watched it.  I've looked at it.  I can't figure it out.  How do you do it?  Well, I take the things.  It's fucking great.  Love it.  Mitch?  Hey, guys.  I love the show.  Thank you.  As you should.  Whack, whack. 
[02:38:00]  Congratulations, I hope you.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  The reason why the Japanese are so batshit crazy, what other countries had two atomic bombs land on them?  It's the radiation.  It's fucking with them.  Well, it didn't spread over the entire country.  It was relatively small for atom bombs.  I like how we just did the straw bombs.  They were small atom bombs.  Yeah, people don't talk about them.  Like, 100 and 180,000, right?  How many dead?  180,000?  Yeah, and then after that, it was just a shitload more stuff. 
[02:38:30]  But you know what else people don't bring up is a lot more people were killed with just incendiary carpet bombing.  That they were just...  And war now has gotten to the point where it has to be precision or else you look like the bad guy, but it's war.  Or, you know, if you send a smart bomb into a building and it skips off the building and hits a hospital, like, the government's got to sit there and go, 
[02:39:00]  Hamna, Hamna, Hamna, we would try to hit the building, I swear.  But meanwhile, back in World War II, you would bomb hospitals just so they couldn't fix the motherfuckers that might be shooting at you again.  It was just incendiary, like, fire bombs.  They would use bombs that would start fires just to burn an entire city down.  They lit Japan on fire before we dropped the bombs.  Yeah.  I think they killed more people in the fire than the bombs did.  They did.  With incendiary bombing, they killed more people than the atomic bombs did. 
[02:39:30]  That was a nice recap of what Anthony just said.  That was funny.  Jesus Christ.  I'll look my girl.  Let's enjoy a nice sandwich for yourself.  You get mad at me to teach your stuff back.  Oh, yeah, you wait a couple minutes.  What's that?  Jesus Christ.  It's hard with a mouthful of fucking bagel.  God, that smells good.  I've never seen you in the morning, stoking up the engine for the day.  Put a little coal in the burner.  Oh, that was my fucking joke.  No.  I had a piece of ham, and it fucking made me laugh. 
[02:40:00]  He's an easy, Kaz Elliott.  Fucking Buford T. Justice.  Give me a Diablo burger and a Dr. Pepper to go.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  By the time I see you, you're like 12,000 or 14,000 calories in.  I've never seen you with the eager passion of a first meal.  Holy shit.  I thought you were watching.  I am.  Isn't that bad?  Are you eating?  I smell like bacon.  I don't smell like bacon, personally.  I smell bacon. 
[02:40:30]  You smell like bacon?  I fucking eat it.  No, I can have this in the morning.  I just can't have it at fucking...  I can't have three of these at two in the morning.  Is that what you were doing?  I had a pink berry last night, too.  Right where you had it.  Me, too.  I had a small, though.  I had a small with a little granola.  There's actually not that many calories.  Oh, what?  Boy, ladies.  Pink berry.  Oh, that pink berry.  Fruity pebbles, though, is the same as granola, if not less.  You don't want to combine dairy with carbs or fruit.  Really?  I don't know.  You're not supposed to combine dairy with anything. 
[02:41:00]  You're not supposed to eat dairy.  I don't eat much.  I had a little pink berry watching you have the fighter.  Are you one of those people that don't dairy?  No, I just started...  I still eat a lot of dairy because of pizza and everything, but I've started just...  I don't even really exercise that much.  Just by eating better, it changes your whole life.  It's all diet.  It has nothing to do with exercise.  People are always over-exercising.  Exercise isn't a bad thing.  It's not bad, but it doesn't...  But it is mostly diet, yeah.  It's all diet because you exercise, you end up just eating more.  Unless you could really be careful what you eat while you exercise, it's nobody is.  You get starving, you think you deserve to eat something, and people, you know, you end 
[02:41:30]  up...  I've wrecked so many workouts right after.  Oh, that was a good one.  Cheesecake.  Yeah, right.  Cunt.  And if you just left it alone.  There's actually an app.  There's a couple people...  The Jim Norton app?  Yes, there is.  Fantastic.  I'm sorry.  Is that not what you meant?  No, it is.  You lose weight on that app.  Yes, you do.  There's an app called Lose It that's actually...  A lot of people have lost a lot of weight on, but you're  right.  It's all mathematics.  You literally add up what you're eating during the day, and it tells you, all right, you're  done.  You can't have any more for the rest of the day.  You ever look at the fucking treadmill numbers when you're on there for 45 minutes and realize 
[02:42:00]  you're like, you're half a cupcake in?  Holy shit, what's the point of this?  The calorie fucking counter on a treadmill is just...  It really takes your whole spirit away to even get on that fucking thing.  What am I doing?  Calories burn per hour.  Like, at this rate, I got to stand on here an hour for nothing.  Yeah, for a cupcake.  I do it for the heart.  Like, I figure it's good for your heart.  No, it is healthy.  It is healthy to do it.  Yeah, it's not just the calorie burning.  It is healthy.  It's very healthy for you, but if you're trying to just get thinner, like, the idea of just 
[02:42:30]  exercising more...  You can't exercise your way to thinness unless you really watch what you eat, and if you're  fat in the first place, it's because you don't have the greatest self-control.  You're not going to start all of a sudden getting exercise, start getting depleted of nourishment,  be starving, and all of a sudden now you become Mr. Fucking Health Conscious with a diet.  Why'd you look at Bobby when you said that?  No, I don't know.  It just crossed my mind.  Well, I was sadder than this, dude.  That looks good.  No, I'm not saying you're...  I'm not talking about you.  I can gain...  I can gain...  Like I told you, I can gain 10 pounds in a week.  It would take me fucking seven...  You're going to eat not shit.  That's not that bad.  That is bad.  It's a whole wheat bagel with ham and egg in the beginning of the day. 
[02:43:00]  It's ham.  I'm going to go all day.  At dinner, I'll have a salad with just protein.  You know, that beautiful salad for yourself?  You should eat six meals a day of small meals.  I eat six meals a day.  Six meals a day.  I don't like the whole pork thing in the morning.  It just seems a lot of...  I eat ham.  I love ham.  I do, too.  I could eat a whole pig.  I want a suckling pig so bad.  Would you eat a dog?  I need a fucking dog.  I need a dog, a cat, a fucking lima. 
[02:43:30]  I'm an active vegetarian now.  Are you real?  No, you're not.  No, no.  Actually, I'm a vegetarian, weirdly, just by accident, but I'm kidding about giving a  shit about the animals.  Although, it is hard, slowly, but surely, you do start to wonder.  I started with pork, really, just ham.  After seeing Farm Inc. and those animal slaughterhouse films, I couldn't eat that.  I don't eat pork anymore, either.  I don't think I'm swine, man.  I'll eat the whole fucking pig.  You want a shaman motherfucking pig?  A shaman motherfucking pig.  Like that almond from green egg.  It tastes like pumpkin pie.  I don't know. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, because there's two types of vegetarians.  There's the ones that do it because they're animal activists and don't like the little  fucking animals getting hurt.  And then there's the ones for their health or something.  They think it's more healthy to just eat vegetables and not have any meat.  Well, the new thing is the green ones to the people that are just because of the planet.  And that's where vegetarians are just going to catch on.  Because it really is like the filthiest thing in the world is the factory-produced animal,  the food.  But really, now, if you watch any of those movies, it makes it harder to eat meat.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:44:30]  He's right.  I won't watch them.  Yeah, that's what you've got to do.  Because I still love it.  I mean, I loved meat and steak for so long.  I didn't get into it.  In fact, it was that girl I was seeing who was a vegan.  But she wasn't like, she didn't try to convert anybody to it.  But when you see how much happier they seem to be and how much healthier.  Yeah, they're fucking happy.  But let me tell you something.  Trying to go out to dinner with these fucking bitches?  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  You sit there and you're thinking of a place to take them.  And vegans are worse than vegetarians.  Vegetarians can at least like, all right, we'll get some fucking pizza for you.  Yeah, but they're always trying to scumbag your rice, too. 
[02:45:00]  Will you eat your rice?  Yeah, we'll eat my fucking rice.  What kind is that brown rice?  Yeah, they're always eyeballing your rice or your potato.  Yeah, you know that fucking vegans, rice stealing motherfuckers.  Fucking rice stealer.  Yeah, fuck it.  And one of my exes, vegetarian, would look at prescription tablets or vitamins to see if  there's gelatin in the coating because gelatin comes from pig fucking knuckles of some shit.  Yeah, people that are really vegan.  Like, the vegans are extreme.  They're like, they're people that don't eat meat because their dads used to, like, fuck 
[02:45:30]  them with pork chops or some crazy shit happen in their life because they can't even be  around me.  But it gradually happens.  And actually, vegans, you know, the health effects are crazy.  I mean, the shit that starts happening to you when you start cutting out meats.  There's nothing to eat if you're a vegan.  What the hell do you eat?  What do you eat?  Boca burgers, I like.  Yeah, you can eat boca burgers.  They're vegans.  Well, boca burgers.  Well, there's something called quinoa, for example.  Any kind of hummus, chickpeas, greens is really mostly what you need.  I like steak.  Yeah, so they eat steak.  If you can eat steak and feel great about it and you feel healthy and good, then eat 
[02:46:00]  it.  I have to do it rarely.  Like, I'm like you.  I watch the slaughterhouse videos.  It made me really depressed.  Yeah.  I stopped eating pig.  Occasionally, I slip and I'll have bacon.  But for the most part, I do not eat.  Fuck the pigs.  I mean, if I'm on a chicken buffet, fuck the pigs, man.  Hey, piggy, piggy.  And chickens.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  And chickens can just suck a dick.  I will eat.  And I've seen those videos.  Oh, yeah.  Well, chickens suck.  It is just a. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, they'll show chickens getting killed on, like, Nickelodeon.  They don't give a, no one gives a fuck about a chicken.  They'll show a guy, like a kid, pulling a chicken head off.  They don't care.  It's a bird.  It's a fucking bird.  We really don't care that much about birds.  You hit a bird on the highway, you're not going like, oh, let me take it to the vet.  You hit a dog or something.  If you hit a cow, you'd be like, oh, my God, I hit a cow.  That's sort of the problem with a lot.  To me, with the vegan, the real extreme vegans, that's kind of the problem, where they don't  distinguish between.  It's like all flesh, all life.  There are even people called fruitarians who only eat, won't even kill, you know, fruits 
[02:47:00]  or vegetables.  They'll only eat things that'll keep the creature alive.  So they'll eat fruit off a tree or something that they can prune off a.  That doesn't make sense.  That's fucking insane.  One of the ones that only eat stuff that has fallen off the, fallen.  That's fruitarians.  I think they might.  Assholes.  They just sit there and wait.  They're all starving.  Looking at a peach, just dangling from a thread.  One guy's cheating.  He's blowing.  Waiting for an earthquake.  Yes.  Jumping up and down.  Maybe we sit Michael J. Fox in the tree.  You know, shit happens.  He would climb a tree.  He kicks his wife in the fucking stomach and bumps her into the tree. 
[02:47:30]  Why does it have to be so violent?  I know, Bob.  What are you fucking talking about?  What do you have to take it?  Sometimes I take it too far.  That's my thing.  Fruitarian.  How annoying are you?  But you know what?  There's no question you feel better when you don't eat meat.  There's no question about it.  Really?  How long did you eat meat?  Not, you know, like everything in my life.  I slip here and there.  You're dabble.  But I haven't eaten a steak.  I haven't eaten a full slab of steak since October.  Oh, you've...  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, and I haven't eaten like real...  I've had like maybe one cheeseburger, like a Burger King, you know, one since October. 
[02:48:00]  I rarely eat any kind of a...  So if you cut most meat out...  I eat a sausage slice occasionally here and there.  Yeah, most meat.  If you cut like 80 or 90% of the meat out, you're probably doing pretty well.  I think so.  I mean, but it depends also on your system.  Some people seem to be able to really eat meat and feel great about it.  It doesn't bother their stomach or anything, but for me, it fucks me up every time.  It's like anything else.  Like smokers that can fucking smoke until they're 90.  Everything's fine.  I used to go to work out for two hours and then smoke and nothing.  I was my favorite cigarette of the day.  The after-workout cigarette. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, right when you're done, you're just dying and you have a protein shake and a butt on a fucking stoop.  Are you kidding me?  I used to love smoking.  No, as soon as I was done, I'd smoke a cigarette.  It didn't cut down on your endurance or anything?  Nope.  You were young.  Nope.  No, I did.  Yeah, that's true, too.  I quit smoking two months ago.  I was running up fucking canyons in the Runyon Canyon in L.A. in Hollywood.  I'd run up the fucking thing, run down it, and they'd have a butt.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I could just fucking smoke. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, smoking was the shit.  You can't appreciate a good cigarette out at a bar.  Nothing better than a drink in one hand, cigarette in the other.  That's a hard one to give up.  When you used to be able to smoke in the bars, it was just the best fucking thing.  You couldn't.  And also, when I was playing video games a lot on computer, I would have an ashtray that  was just up a fucking mountain.  I didn't realize how nervous I got before shows.  People would always get nervous.  No, no, no.  Until I quit smoking.  Then I was like...  No, the cigarette would fucking chill me the fuck out. 
[02:49:30]  What's the most you smoked a day?  Probably two and a half packs.  For an extended period of time, you were two and a half packs smoking?  Probably two packs for a while.  It was up to about a pack.  I was easily a pack.  Maybe a pack and a half.  I might have done two packs occasionally, but I would say about a pack and a half.  You were Parliament, right?  I was Newports at one point.  I was Marlboro Red.  I was Marlboro Light.  I was Fire Levin.  I was Merit at one point.  Ew, really?  Aunt Bob?  Aunt Bob?  Aunt Bob was that. 
[02:50:00]  Why not Virginia Slims?  What would you do?  Put on your fucking heels and have a Merit?  I was banging this blonde chick with a goofy face and just an insane body.  From Jersey?  No, she was from Boston, but she smoked.  She got me into Merits.  Hottest body I've ever fucked, but her face was just goofy.  Yeah?  Just a goofball.  If you looked at her face while you were fucking her, you'd laugh.  That's sweet of you to say.  Yeah.  I hope she's listening.  You think she is?  Yeah.  How many chicks smoked Merit that fucked you?  Two.  So if she smokes Merit. 
[02:50:30]  In other words, I'm bumming a shit cigarette off of someone, too.  I was like, ah, because I was always the Marlboro guy.  I loved a good Marlboro, and anything else paled in comparison.  Winstons were terrible.  Winstons were trying to want to be Marlboro.  Like a Marlboro that had been stored in shit for a few weeks.  I used to smoke a lot of menthols.  Did you?  Because of ecstasy and all that.  Did you really?  I just kind of got into it then, and then just got used to them.  I went to a really black high school.  A lot of menthol cigarettes? 
[02:51:00]  Well, yeah, and I smoked Marlboros.  And sometimes some of the black kids would be like, hey, you got a cigarette?  And I'd whip out my red pack of Marlboros, and then they'd go, ah, forget it.  That's great.  And then they'd punch you in the face.  And then I'd get sucker punched.  Now that I got cigarettes, you can actually squeeze the filter, pop it, and it makes it  a menthol.  Yeah, it's a regular cigarette.  Yeah, it's a regular cigarette, and then pop something in there, and it just makes,  like there's a liquid Tic Tac inside of the fucking filter.  But I hear it tastes menthol anyway, even if you don't pop the thing a little bit. 
[02:51:30]  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I miss smoking.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Ruin my party.  What about that vapor one that you could actually smoke even on airplanes, huh?  Have you seen it?  Can't you smoke it on planes?  Yeah.  They let you?  Apparently.  I've never seen anybody do it, but I'm told it's legal.  You know, it looks like some kind of device you could use to explode something with.  Nah, it's like yours.  I'd be scared.  My father-in-law's got one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we bought it for him?  Yeah, it's just, it's all vapor, so like Greg said, you can smoke it wherever you want.  What is it like burning?  You buy this, like, it's like liquid, like nicotine almost. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, great.  It's like a plastic.  It's liquid carcinogen.  It's liquid cancer.  It costs like 30 bucks a bottle.  No, it's much safer than regular smoking.  Haven't you heard our sponsors?  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry.  Fuck, what am I saying?  Yes, it is much safer.  I've seen them, and it actually, you can smoke them on planes.  It's fucking cool, man.  It makes a cock bigger.  We bought it for him, and he maybe used it for five days.  He's trying to do damage control.  Then went back to regular cigarettes.  Then went right back to smoking.  Why?  I couldn't see.  Because, like, I tried it when I was still smoking. 
[02:52:30]  Like, we bought it for him, and, you know, it kind of tasted like a cigarette.  But it didn't give you that.  Why don't you just tell him that he's going to want to see his grandchild grow up and fucking  quit smoking?  I don't know.  When he's 65, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  Quit smoking.  They quit, and that's when they get the big casino.  I still have a carton.  Are you?  Get rid of it.  It's $100, dude.  It's not like it's $10 like it used to be.  Like an unopened pack of Tops baseball cards.  I had to have a fucking cigarette.  They're gettable. 
[02:53:00]  The dude show up at the cellar, the black dude, what's his name, show up at the cellar  with a trash bag, like a drug dealer, once a week.  Selling cigarettes?  Yeah, because it was so expensive.  $100 a carton.  How much did he charge?  $10 a cash.  $65.  Not that bad.  $6.50 a pack.  Fuck, man.  And he got pinched, broke his cherry.  No, he actually was sad.  He came down one night.  I was like, I'm done.  He was like, really, man?  Oh, he must have been bummed.  He was like, no.  He was bummed, and he was like, good for you, man.  Good luck.  Did he have like a little smile, like, I'll see you again. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll see you again, motherfucker.  How long did you quit?  It's three months.  Cool.  Maybe three, going on four, something like that.  My last one was, I think it was like December 7th or whatever of 01.  Really?  Yeah.  That long ago.  Yeah, I smoked my last cigarette at NAW.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember when you quit.  I just love walking in the airport now, because I used to have to go, hang, check in, then  come back out, smoke my butts, then go in, and then fucking be frantic.  And if there was a delay or it's a six-hour flight, you're panicking, I'm not going to  get the smoke, and then come out. 
[02:54:00]  As soon as you come out, smoke a butt.  The hotels, fucking, nobody, you can't smoke in hotels anymore, so you've got to either  go downstairs or fucking try to put your head out the window.  Pay the cleaning fee.  Give me a...  Weirdly enough, I was one of those people, for all my addictive tendencies, you know,  I never got full-blown addicted to smoking.  I would smoke, and I've even gone through phases where I would smoke like a pack in a  day, but I was always able to kind of put quick.  I would stop.  One of the best things about smoking was if there was a situation, a stressful situation, 
[02:54:30]  you got a bad phone call or something, and you're like, you light a cigarette up and take  the biggest drag, you just...  Just a giant drag into your lungs.  We're all going to smoke after the show.  I know, we're all just going to go out and buy cigarettes.  We can't go out and smoke until we're all quitting again sometimes.  I've been smoking a lot of hookah lately. 
[02:55:00]  Oh yeah, what's up with the hookah?  That's like...  And now I'm starting to get worried because now it's like every night, it's like, oh,  maybe I'll have some hookah.  I bought four of them.  I remember your hookah obsession.  Dude, I had a hookah obsession.  Is this before or after the pens?  I'm on a stylist obsession now, by the way.  Are you?  Yeah, stylist for the iPad.  Oh yeah.  What?  Because they're good.  Stop trying to make things perfect.  Just enjoy your life as you're having me.  Stop trying to make things...  What?  Stop trying to make things perfect.  Can't somebody try to tell you something?  Stop trying to make things perfect. 
[02:55:30]  Dude, I had four hookahs.  I'd go in between spots and selling them.  Oh, hookahs.  At the same time?  At the same time.  Yeah, four hookahs.  Dude, I had four hookahs.  One of them was black.  Yeah, we had a colored one.  I think I'd bring for you four hookahs.  Dude, remember it was green one time.  Why did it...  Why did it...  Why?  Four hookahs.  What's with the hookah, Danny? 
[02:56:00]  It's making like a comeback.  I mean, obviously this thing's been around for a while, but it's kind of taken off now.  Didn't Alexander the Great smoke one?  Yeah, I know.  He's smoking a hookah.  It's clearly taking the edge off the whole Middle Eastern culture.  Yes, yes.  A lot of these hookah joints are becoming like real popular hangouts for like college age  kids.  Yeah, of course.  They think they're worldly and kind of interesting.  It's better than just smoking, man.  It's a communal thing, man.  It's really good.  We don't have to talk about politics and the world and the fucking, you know, the summit. 
[02:56:30]  The summit.  I didn't know if it was the G2 or summit.  Remember the party I had?  Remember the party I had where I had all the hookahs out?  Like, I put all my hookahs out, but nobody...  I showed up with a bat and took care of that thing.  He just shows up with...  And I give him the camera.  He goes...  He just shows up.  It's all my wife's friends and him.  One of my friends.  That's your fault.  Oh, that awful party.  This cock sucker...  Why did you do that?  That party sucked.  Takes my camera.  He goes up to everybody.  Hi, I'm the official party photographer. 
[02:57:00]  And takes pictures of everybody's tits.  That's all we had.  All we had was people's tits.  And then he left.  Then he left.  He got some food and goes, all right, I'm leaving.  I still have a folder of...  It was called Bob and Dawn's Party.  It was at our old place at 520 on 43rd Street.  It was fucking in the courtyard.  I was taking pictures of feet, like scalps, tits.  Not one face.  That party stunk.  That hookah party was a bust.  Hookah party.  Came down with my apple and my strawberry.  Dude, I'm going to get a hookah.  I'm a party. 
[02:57:30]  It made Mary Tyler Moore's parties look like fucking Puff Daddy's White events.  Thank you.  Dude, you got your hookahs set up.  Yeah, dude, you got your...  You got your she-shirts.  You got your chocos.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  It's friends.  You're friends.  I like Danny's version.  Yeah.  Danny's version.  You got your chocos.  Is there a ritual with the hookah?  Not really.  Yeah, wash the tip so it doesn't smell.  You know what?  I guess there is one because you have to clean it and then take the tobacco and pack your  little bowl and do the tinfoil with the charcoal. 
[02:58:00]  So yeah, it is kind of like a...  Tinfoil choice.  Sounds like a crack.  Yeah, a charcoal.  Sounds like you're chasing the dragon.  Yeah.  Everything's everything.  You get a charcoal thing that you light.  A little...  Charcoal?  It's like a disc.  You put the charcoal disc and then you put...  And they light that and it lights up slowly.  Yeah, because the tobacco, it's not dry.  It's a very wet, moist tobacco.  Oh, so it's got to keep the heat.  Right.  So you don't...  Instead of light, keep light and light and light.  It just stays lit for like an hour and a half.  Oh, motherfucker.  It tastes like...  It tastes...  The apple?  How good is that one?  I have a sour apple.  It's pretty good. 
[02:58:30]  Sour apple is fucking good.  But there is a little bit of nicotine in there.  Yeah.  A little bit.  It's not as much as a pack of cigarettes.  Oh, boy.  But all of a sudden, I'm on my third night in a row and I'm like, is this a problem?  Yeah.  Is this now a problem?  Well, they put alcohol in it, too.  Instead of water, they'll put some booze in there.  Yeah.  And you get fucked up.  You don't need the hookah.  You know what, though?  It's not like you could take it with you in your pocket and just start smoking it.  No, they have travel ones.  In the car.  They do have travel ones.  I bought a travel...  I bought a travel...  Dude, I'm a fucking addict.  I bought them all. 
[02:59:00]  I had a fucking eight person with a little octopus.  You have an eight-hose hookah.  Dude, I had fucking hookahs as tall as you.  He had fucking hookahs with twice as many things as he had friends on them.  So I had one?  Oh, come on, guys.  Oh, Lord, oh, buddy.  Do you know that?  I went to take a dump before and what came out of my ass smelled so bad that I had to flush  it down immediately.  I couldn't even take my phone out to take a picture.  I was like, fuck it.  Next time.  Like fucking dream catcher shit? 
[02:59:30]  Go back to the toilet.  It just has holes in the bottom.  It's just leaking water.  I was going to take a picture and send it to Travis.  And I was like, fuck it, dude.  Yeah, it burns through like alien blood.  It was like sandy.  It was like wet sand.  Looks like the video of that oil rig.  One time a friend of mine, he had to call me to the toilet because he had made what looked  exactly like a lava lamp beginning to like melt and form.  And he forced me to look at it. 
[03:00:00]  And he goes, see, it looks like a lava lamp.  Do you ever shit so much that when you go to wipe your ass, you knuckles, skim it?  Yes, yes.  Jesus Christ.  And this is why women are hateable.  They would never have this discussion.  No, you know what I hate?  When you have a nice liquidy dump, but there's air behind it.  So it ends up going off like a flashbang.  Clean the room.  And then you've got to clean.  You're actually wiping your ass cheeks. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And you're getting shit on top of the paper.  How about when you didn't notice that that happened and you wipe and then you pull your  undies up.  Well, and then later on you pull it down and they're speckled.  Sometimes.  I mean, you know when that's a possibility.  Yeah.  So usually what I'll do is if I'm like, I think I know what's going on here, I will  make sure to check any surrounding areas.  I'll go right into the shower from the fucking toilet.  You can't do that here.  I try to do that every time.  You know, sometimes you just, the emergency light goes off. 
[03:01:00]  Meh, meh, meh.  And it's beyond wiping.  I got the big day.  You know, DEFCON fucking, it's beyond wiping.  You got to head right for the fucking decontamination shower.  I hate those thick shits that just meander and like they come out and it breaks off  in giant chunks.  But you can see like if you, if you, if you put your finger in, you're going to be hitting  shit for 11 more inches.  You hate those?  Those are the ones you hate?  Why do you hate those?  Because your ass is always full of shit and it's always when you have to fucking leave  for the airport.  How about the shit so you have to leave with a fucking half a log in there still? 
[03:01:30]  The shit that's so dark and evil that it hits, as soon as it hits the toilet, it hardens  like fucking tar.  A good cancer shit.  Wow.  You can't even piss it off?  It just fucking stuck on the inside?  I know, I'm just looking at the, where's that chick?  I didn't know who it was.  I know, it looked like Earl.  I thought Earl's ass was...  Don't go to the Audubon ballroom, ma'am.  A little Malcolm X.  All right.  The, yeah, sometimes if you have something really fun to look at on your iPhone or something 
[03:02:00]  and you're on the, on the turlet after you've taken your dump, just a standard dump, and  then you're reading for a while and you realize you've been there for a while, so you get  up and the water actually looks like tea has been steeping.  It's sort of discolored the water around it.  Looks like every river in India.  It's like a, like a good, uh, post-beet salad dump.  Ah.  Where it just sort of like, just pinks things up the water a little bit.  Looks like you're miscarrying.  I get, I get frightened if I forget that I've had like red peppers or something. 
[03:02:30]  You look and think your intestines are falling out or decomposing inside of you.  I'm a hypochondriac.  I take a shit and look at it and just be like, ah.  I went years without even looking at my dumps because I was afraid there would be like a  problem that I would see and I'd rather just not.  Like cum?  That's a problem.  I chew all my corn except for one piece and then I look for that one unchewed piece. 
[03:03:00]  The tracer, yeah.  Yeah, see if you can find it.  The tracer.  The tracer.  Tracer round.  I shit yesterday.  I, I, I literally would take 20 minute shits.  Like I'm on the toilet and I'm playing QWERTY and fuck it, I got my feet up and I shit but  I know there's more and it's like, it was like this continual ecstasy.  It was like your ass is just going like, meh.  It was like not a lot of shit but it was after a while.  Yeah, it was a really weird slow release.  It was wonderful.  That's what's so great about modern day technology. 
[03:03:30]  It gives you so much more to do on the bowl than the old days where all you had if you  were lucky were jokes for the John.  Sit there and read some of the jokes for the John.  You'd read every, the back of everything.  Yeah, oh, because, because you do have to read to take a comfy dump.  Yeah.  And, and you would take a, a toothpaste tube out of the garbage and just read about, you  know, fluoride, wow, that's a nine out of ten dentist survey.  Because without something to read, you're just fucking stuck. 
[03:04:00]  I know, it's just boring.  Yeah.  Now you can play games, you're on fucking, boom, you're shitting, bam, you're doing your  banking, boom, you do this, bam, I'm listening to Jimmy Norton's app, but the sounds, boom.  I Twitter a lot while I shit.  Do you?  I love a good fucking shitter.  I can't, I guess it shouldn't surprise me that you could just eat like that while you're  having a salad.  I guess it shouldn't surprise me, but holy shit.  I'm about to throw up.  You're like eating a tomato watching a beheading.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm about to throw up, you're munching into that thing. 
[03:04:30]  I, uh, I prefer, um, shuffleboard bowling on the, on the toity.  Ah.  Yeah, you sit there, a little shuffleboard bowling app.  That's what those games are good for.  Yeah, I don't, where, I don't usually play, uh, iPhone games anywhere else.  I got a fucking computer at home if I want to do gaming with graphics and stuff.  But on the, on the toilet?  Yeah.  Those fucking, it's a, it's a miracle of modern technology.  I, I play the, uh, I do the, the TMZ app, which is great.  I use that one, and then the. 
[03:05:00]  Wait, you catch up on your entertainment news while you're taking a dump?  Yeah, I catch up, and then I play Orbital.  Orbital on the fucking iPhone is insane.  What's that?  Orbital is fucking great.  You gotta get that one.  What is it?  Describe it to me.  You gotta shoot these balls, and they expand as much as they can expand.  Like, if it has a little, if you put it in the corner, it only can expand a little, it  just gets big a little bit.  But if it's in the middle, it'll just grow the size of the screen, and you gotta keep  shooting them up.  And then every time you hit it, it starts at a three, and then you hit it, it becomes  a two, and then you hit it, it becomes a one, and then you hit it again, it goes away. 
[03:05:30]  So you gotta keep shooting them, and build, it's crazy.  You certainly aren't describing this well.  I'm glad you didn't write the instructions for this game.  You shoot, it becomes a one, a two, a three.  It's hard to explain.  It's hard to explain.  Let's start, let's rewind.  Let's go back in time.  Ready?  Ask me again.  TMZ.  How do you like that app?  I love TMZ.  That's all I do on the toilet.  The TMZ guys talked to me the other day.  I don't play games.  I don't play games.  No more games?  No.  The bad thing with the phones, my son, they're too young to have his own phone, but they 
[03:06:00]  want to borrow, you know, to play, and then all of a sudden in the middle  of it, they're sitting there playing fucking Brick Breaker or something, and some dirty broad  sends in a text.  A text?  Yes.  I've had people grab my phone and be like, yeah, let me see this, and I'm just like,  it's like hot potato.  No, don't.  Don't ding.  Don't ding.  Ding.  Text comes up.  Years ago, my girlfriend needed my phone for a few hours.  Oh, God.  It was legitimate because her phone was broken.  Did you just take your phone and throw it on the ground? 
[03:06:30]  No, mine broke, too.  It was the worst couple of hours of my life.  Don't call me.  Nobody text me.  Nobody text me.  I got away with it, too.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Nobody texted me.  Wow.  Yeah, because there was a point in my career where my text was going off constantly, and  if someone would just be like, oh, yeah, oh, let me see that picture, and they're  looking at the picture, and I'm just like, sweat, one bead of sweat dripping down my cheek.  You're like the Total Recall guy? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The fucking doctor guy in Total Recall.  He sees me sweating.  Oh, shit.  But back on Earth, you'll get text messages.  Yeah, you get desensitized to that, too, at a certain point.  Like, I don't get that much weird shit, and you forget.  Somebody's looking through your picture.  It's like, holy shit, how many pairs of tits do you have on here?  Yeah.  I had to go with the vault.  With the vault picture thing on my phone.  Do you have the vault?  I do.  Where you put the code in.  It's a fucking locked vault.  I'm downloading it right now. 
[03:07:30]  And what you do is you go into the vault, and then it says a plus sign.  You hit the plus sign.  It says add pictures.  You go to your photo album, and you press each picture you want added to the vault, and  then you delete from your photo album.  You delete them in the photo album.  It doesn't delete them from the vault.  No.  Oh.  Then they're in the vault.  So then, you know, if you want to look in the vault.  So then you can just open up your pictures and, hey, take a look.  Because it never fails.  Whenever you show someone a picture, they will grab it and instinctively slide to the 
[03:08:00]  next fucking shot.  Yeah.  Always.  You know how many people have stumbled on duty pictures by accident?  Jesus.  I'd rather have a cock picture or a pussy picture, because at least you can explain,  yes, my dick.  Yeah, just shit.  But people go, what do you have that for?  It's just a pile of my shit.  Jesus.  Can I like to show my friends?  And they want to see it.  Do you have a lot of titties and pussy pictures?  Yeah.  Please.  I don't have any.  I don't have any.  Please.  I have back-to-back shit pictures.  Let me see. 
[03:08:30]  Version one.  Back-to-back shit pictures.  And version two.  I got an L.  I only take pictures when it's a letter.  I don't.  I have no shit pictures.  Oh, my God.  I did a Q one day.  Remember the Q I made?  That's hard to make.  I made a win.  I made a win Hotel W once, too.  A Q.  Oh, did I do a win Hotel?  That's a hard one.  You ever see that?  No.  I'm so upset I just backed up all my photos the other day.  I have nothing.  I had so much poo.  Some pussy pictures.  I got some great fucking light. 
[03:09:00]  I had a lot of poo.  All right.  This is great.  We're all just looking at my pictures.  Fucking photos.  I see that one.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  What is that one?  What is that one?  Girl.  She's lovely.  That's not real.  Remember her?  That's not real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's real?  Oh, yeah.  Can I see that?  How old is that one?  Is that real?  No.  Fucking hero.  It's a while ago.  My God's in hero.  Great one.  Oh, that's in the vault, though.  You lock those up in the vault.  I'm going to get the vault. 
[03:09:30]  You don't need a vault, though, do you?  You're single.  No, but you show your mom pictures and shit.  I only show my mom vault pictures.  This is when I was taking a shit on his face.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy, you look like you need a little more fiber in your diet.  Are you eating chocolate crayons?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  How do you get your shit so dark?  People get so upset.  Welcome to the Stuff You Can't See show.  Sorry, guys.  No, I know.  Look, we apologize. 
[03:10:00]  But I think everybody has stuff on their phone.  You don't have to be seeing what we're looking at to relate to the fact that you do have shit  you can't show people.  That's right.  You know?  I don't even know what's worse.  Like, trying to hide it.  Like, with my kids now, because I have them a couple days a week, and I'm between my computer  and my phones.  You know, they go near it.  I go, no, don't go to the phone.  Like, I'm protecting them from what?  They're already looking at me like, dad, what the fuck is on this computer that it's  so toxic that you flip out?  You never had to deal with that when it was just a phone in your house.  Don't touch the phone.  Don't touch the phone. 
[03:10:30]  You pick it up, and some girl is just talking about sucking your dick on there.  That's the equivalent of right now.  Is it like, no, don't go by the phone, and your chick picks up the phone and is like,  I just want to suck your cock.  Who is this?  Now it's the same thing, only in pictures and texts.  Yeah.  All kinds of other things that will get you in a lot of trouble.  A lot of trouble.  I was trying to think, God, I just lost my train of thought because I had something that  got...  Oh, right.  Facebook was left open on my computer, signed in under a girl's name, and thought everything 
[03:11:00]  was fine and dandy, and forgot about the computer.  Another girl turns on Facebook, and it pops up to this girl's page.  I was like, oh.  Yeah.  So she was obviously over my house using my computer.  Yeah.  And there's no explaining it.  Oh, I always sign on to her Facebook.  I'm a hacker.  Yes. 
[03:11:30]  I'm a hacker.  Take the ur off of it, please.  I'm kidding.  Bobby Kelly's going to be at Uncle Vinny's.  Saturday night.  In Staten Island.  I'm sure it's a legit operation.  You just don't get food, but you just get cake.  That was an actual policy of one of those Staten Island one-nighters I did with Sam Brown  years ago, where we try to order lunch.  We try to order dinner, and they go, you just don't get food, but you just get cake.  You just get cake. 
[03:12:00]  You just get cake.  You just get a nice piece of cake for your size.  What happened to Sam Brown?  He was a funny dude, man.  Is he still doing stand-up?  Was he?  As a guy.  Yeah, he was funny.  No, he was funny.  Sam had one of the best raps with chicks I've ever seen.  Yeah.  He could fucking pick up any broad.  But he could talk to anybody.  Sam Brown was an amazing rap.  Yeah.  I think he's a screenwriter in L.A.  Oh, is he still in the...  Okay.  Yeah.  Some guys can do that.  Dude, he could talk to anybody.  Oh, I'm watching the news.  Sorry.  This seems to be a fashion show on.  Who?  Where's our penthouse chick?  The news is not... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, isn't she supposed to go in?  She got caught up in traffic.  What?  For 40 minutes?  Jesus Christ.  That's what I heard.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Yeah, because we like the broads.  I'm going to hit the can.  Yeah.  All this shit talk.  Whose can?  Yes.  It's my can and it's open for business.  Please, Jesus, have him pick me.  She just signed in, apparently.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Right after the break, we should be ready.  Then we'll be ready for Penthouse Pet, Jade Vixen. 
[03:13:00]  She'll be in here and talk about what?  How it is to be in Penthouse?  How about her shits?  Um, her shits.  Yeah, let's just ask her things like that we were just talking about.  Wouldn't it be great if she had bigger log pictures than any of us?  Yeah, oh, look at this one.  Wow, that's a giant shit.  Fucking walnuts in it.  Such a petite, tiny...  Two martini shit.  Ah, shit, two martini.  This one I was dieting shit.  It's just black water.  Ugh.  Oh, God. 
[03:13:30]  Nothing worse than pissing out your ass, man.  I actually...  It's just such a dumb, weird feeling.  You feel like a chick sitting there, and it makes the same sound.  You feel like a chick.  You know what I hate about it?  Like, guy pisses at altitude, so it sounds like a stream of water.  When chicks, like, leave the door open a little, and you hear that, it's the...  And then it goes...  Well, they're doing a little squeezy thing.  It's sort of like an air vintage or something that goes on.  Yeah.  It's like a jet blast.  Yeah, it's like jet propelled.  They've got some kind of fucking vortices. 
[03:14:00]  If I'm taking that in your mouth...  Jesus Christ.  A lot of pressure?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of pressure right at the fucking exit point?  You clean your teeth out with this?  Yeah, like a water pick.  In my old apartment, before I was 20, I used to have this dom come over in Spanish, and  she'd piss in my mouth, and literally, she would just fill my mouth and make me swallow,  and she would have, like, fucking eight or nine mouthfuls.  How did you...  Oh, Bobby.  Bobby, almost...  Dude, she would...  Mouthful after mouthful.  Like a pool?  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Like a pool?  And I would go, okay, okay.  It must have made that sound, too, like...  As it filled up, the tone went up, and then you had to just gulp it down.  But she couldn't see me, so she was so fucking sexy.  And she'd piss in my mouth.  Sounds sexy.  Yeah, she was.  She sounds odd.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Some fucking Mexican pissing in your mouth.  And I would go, okay, okay.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That's what I know I sound like.  Uh-huh.  That meant my mouth was...  How did you go, uh-huh?  Uh-huh.  Without choking on...  Can you do that?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Wait, let's do it real. 
[03:15:00]  No, my mouth is full.  No.  You can't say, uh-huh, with...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, you're doing it out your nose.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And then you would swallow her urine.  I actually just did the prove I went, uh-huh, with piss in my mouth test.  Passed the flying color.  I did not believe you.  I did not believe you.  I was definitely having a little bit of an outer body moment there.  I thought, what the fuck are we talking about?  Let's go to that one.  Absolutely.  Oh, you can show me how you do it with real piss.  I was pleased, right?  I have to take a leak.  Okay, we'll be right there. 
[03:15:30]  Where's the girl?  I hear she's on her way up.  And also, she said she wanted to make wee-wees in your mouth.  But, uh, you know...  Can't do it.  Company policy.  Can't do it.  I got a girl.  Jimmy's just a catty.  He can't be having a pissing in his mouth.  Hi, everybody. 
[03:16:00]  Hello.  Opian Anthony Show.  Uh, being joined by Greg Giraldo.  And, uh, of course, Bobby Kelly.  Robert Kelly.  What do you like better, Bobby?  Because I call you Bobby.  Kids are watching me blur that cock.  What'd you say?  Faggot?  What do you like?  Yeah, are you a Bobby or a Robert?  Uh, I don't give a shit.  Robert's my website.  If you Google Bob Kelly, some guy who carves wood in New Hampshire comes up.  Oh, I love that guy. 
[03:16:30]  He's funny.  He is pretty funny.  Oh, wait.  Maybe that was your story.  Oh, wait.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Look who's in studio.  Hello, madam.  Jade Vixen.  Madam.  How are you?  Madam.  I'm too young to be called madam.  Damn.  Yeah, I'm already off on the wrong foot there, James.  My apologies.  It's okay.  So, uh, you were a little late.  You got hitched.  Where'd you travel?  In the city?  Um, yeah.  Driving across the city.  That'll happen.  Obama's coming in, uh, the city.  So they're setting up all kinds of blockades.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It's not supposed to be till, like, five, but they have some kind of pre-thing. 
[03:17:00]  I gotta go to JFK Airport.  I'm probably gonna travel.  Oh, that's good.  That's exactly where he's coming in and leaving from again.  So you'll be screwed the whole time.  Really?  Yeah.  Yay.  I gotta leave soon, then.  Air Force One.  Coming in.  They usually don't clear the runways for that, though.  They just bring them in the pattern just like any other plane.  Oh, see, I think they would clear.  My flight's at 150.  You're important enough for Air Force 116. 
[03:17:30]  That didn't make sense.  There's only one.  But, so, Jade.  Very lovely.  I'm glad you're just as disgusted with my version of Chip.  I don't mind your version of Chip.  You are in the March 2010 issue of Penthouse.  Yes.  Very lovely.  Thank you.  Are you guys passing it around right now?  Yeah, yeah.  I've already looked at it.  It's unbelievable.  You know, we've done this so many times with so many girls and stuff.  Is that awkward for you as we're just perusing your nude pictures while you're in the room?  Not at all. 
[03:18:00]  Really?  I'm really comfortable naked.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, a right thin strip.  Okay.  Oh, whoa.  That was the easiest guy's name ever.  Wow, wait.  I actually took pictures with the W.O.W. stickers.  I was like, oh, look at my boobs.  Oh, man.  Were the pictures taken by a heavyset gentleman with a goatee?  Yes, they were.  He doesn't work for the show.  That's fake.  Oh.  Oopsie.  Jeez.  They're going right up.  Okay.  I got a jacket off. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  That's, yeah.  I don't know.  I see some pink bra straps.  That's very sexy.  Coming out over this little top.  Do you need some music?  Do you want some music?  Na, na, na.  I was probably standing up.  Wow.  Holy shit.  How long have you been doing film?  I mean, doing what?  I'm just focusing over here, Bob.  It really, I know.  Bob's asking, like, legit questions.  Like, dude, Chad leads me to the outer bridge.  That was you, dummy.  Oh, that's stupid. 
[03:19:00]  That was him.  That was him.  You know, 10-10 wins, I think.  Jim cares more about traffic than about me getting...  Yes.  No.  He already said a rude remark when he walked in.  Wow.  I can't even talk.  Oh, wow.  She's wearing a pink bra with very, very large, beautiful breasts.  And, uh...  Wow.  Yeah.  She's on pink, uh...  Getting stuck.  I'm going to have to download that Vault app right now.  Yeah, yeah.  That's definitely...  This is one for the Vault.  Wow.  Yeah, you got very...  Where did that come from?  Vicky's?  No.  Oh, no.  It's Agent Provocateur. 
[03:19:30]  Agent Provocateur.  Even better.  Much more expensive, though.  It fits much better.  Does it?  I love that she's putting her shoes back on.  She puts her shoes back on.  Oh, of course.  I have to wear heels.  I love heels.  That's good, yeah.  How tall are you without them?  A 5'5".  What nationality are you?  I'm Chinese.  Chinese?  Wow.  But I was born and raised in New York.  I'm a native New Yorker.  Yes.  She's a lovely girl.  Wow.  Look at that slender waist.  Wowie, wee, wee.  And that...  Yeah.  What's your tattoo?  She has a little tattoo.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's a testament to youthful stupidity.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  What is it? 
[03:20:00]  All right.  It's a tribal.  No, it's not that bad, though.  It's kind of on the upper left, above the vagina hip, yeah.  Above the vagina hip.  What are you doing, an autopsy?  Yes.  There's a tattoo on the upper vagina hip, but we'll not crack the ribcage.  Can we get any more clinical about my body?  It was a testament to stupidity, Sam.  We've got to stop these girls from getting tattoos.  Hey, at least it's not a tramp stamp.  That's true, yeah.  That's true.  Someone wanted to get a tramp stamp of just the word tramp stamp.  How stupid is that? 
[03:20:30]  Do you do films, too?  I haven't done that much film work.  Was it all girl-girl stuff that you did, or did you do hardcore?  No, I don't do hardcore.  I do softcore.  Okay.  Guy-girl or girl-girl?  No, girl-girl.  Girl-girl.  Or solo-girl.  Oh, really?  Masturbation videos?  No, I haven't done any masturbation videos yet.  So what's one girl?  Like, just you?  Me dressing up and being cute.  Oh, okay.  No diddling, though?  No, I don't really diddle.  No?  No?  No diddling on cam?  No, I get off more on, like, dressing up and getting dressed.  And to very elaborate outfits. 
[03:21:00]  Really?  That's kind of backwards to what a lot of guys enjoy, which is watching girls get undressed.  You can do things like this.  Oh, yeah.  She has a very lovely vagina, by the way.  With your clothes on.  Yeah.  She just pulled aside.  Bob's leaving.  Bob's just walking out now to...  What did I do?  That was a bizarre movie.  I'm not into anything crazy or wild.  I like to wear a dress-up in fancy outfits, and then just whips out the whole thing.  Well, that's the whole point.  You can get dressed and then expose yourself while keeping the outfit on.  Yeah, I like that, too, actually.  Because, I mean, like, a naked girl is hot, but, you know, when it's just a peak, and 
[03:21:30]  it's kind of, like, surreptitious, like I'm sneaking.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's a lot hotter.  I love the up-to-start stuff.  It's really, really sexy.  There you go.  See?  It's totally voyeuristic.  She has a very, very pretty vagina.  Yeah.  I like her hips.  She had a pretty vagina, Sam.  Yeah, you're very hourglass-y.  Yeah, she got great hips.  Yeah.  Let's just gawk over her.  Yeah, good.  Nice.  That's what we're doing.  We're just gawking over you.  Yeah.  Wait, you approached to begin training as a professional dom when you were 18.  Now, boot worship and psychological and tickle torture and corporal. 
[03:22:00]  So you didn't do any type of sensual domination?  No, I really wasn't.  I'm not into getting other people off, and that's why I probably was not a very good dominatrix,  because I don't really care about pleasing others.  I'm all about making myself happy and self-gratification.  That's kind of a good dom, though.  That's kind of like a pure dom.  Just like Sean, our intern.  Greedy and selfish sexually.  You like maybe laying back and letting somebody else take care of your business, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's all about me. 
[03:22:30]  Were you allowing foot worship and stuff like that?  No, I don't like bodily...  I don't like other people drooling on me.  It's kind of gross.  Wow.  You were just hurting.  And you're in penthouse?  Yeah.  I mean, because you seem to have a little bit of a few...  And I don't want to use the word hang-ups, but, you know, usually sexuality involves  a lot of bodily fluids and touching.  I don't want some strange male licking my feet that I don't know.  I don't know where his mouth has been.  That's pretty gross.  It could have been on your cock earlier today, for all I know, you know?  It probably was.  And it will be later again. 
[03:23:00]  Try not to be insulted by the fact that she thought that somebody who's been anywhere  near your cock could be anywhere near her feet.  Yes, I know.  It was like a huge downgrade.  Oh, believe me.  I took that.  I didn't even catch it.  That's just a good point.  I don't want my feet being touched by something that might have touched your cock.  Now, in your personal love life, where, you know, you know the gentleman, I guess you'd  be more up for exchange of fluids and... 
[03:23:30]  Yes, after he's gotten an STD test.  And more taking...  Which ones won't you accept?  Which diseases are no good?  Anything incurable?  Anything viral and incurable?  What are you trying to lie?  What are you trying to tell me, Jimmy?  Fair question.  Oh, damn, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  So, STD test.  And then it would be okay.  But you're into, like, rolling around and...  Elaborate more. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying.  I'm a little...  Stop using euphemisms.  You're kind of naked.  Just spit it out.  Ed wants to know, do you like, like, once you get to the STD test and he is clean, do  you like to fuck raw?  It's not a bad question, right?  No, it's not a bad question.  Without condoms.  I can't take the pill, so I never do that.  Oh, boo.  Oh, how about that?  Why can't you?  It makes me really sick and bitchy, and I lose all interest in sex.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Turn into a wife.  No, it was rotten.  I know.  What can I say, but it's true. 
[03:24:30]  But, yeah, no, what I meant was you like pleasing somebody that you care about.  Oh, yes.  All right, because I was confused when you were talking about the Dom thing.  I just thought you were talking about men in general and that you just like to lay back  and be taken care of.  Oh, no, no, no.  All right.  Okay.  So, you're willing to, you know, give a little.  Yes.  And get a little.  In my personal life.  Yeah, in your personal life.  You got a bow?  You got yourself a boyfriend?  Oh, yes, I do.  You do?  Yes, I do.  Yeah?  And what does he do?  He likes to dress up in outfits like I do. 
[03:25:00]  In women's clothing?  No, not in women's clothing.  I like to dress in women's clothing.  No, not at all.  Bella?  No.  What's he dress up as?  Well, we actually attend a lot of fetish events together, and we usually wear matching  outfits to all of them.  He's a renaissance fop.  Actually, no.  I want to put a bow.  No, I tend to go for military outfits and latex.  Oh, yeah?  And so we wear matching military outfits, officer outfits with caps to all of them.  Something perhaps from the 30s, maybe early 40s European theater?  No, not necessarily.  Oh, damn it.  So does he wear latex, too? 
[03:25:30]  Yes, he does.  He's a rubberist like me.  A rubberist?  Yes.  Oh.  That doesn't sound very nutritious.  I thought we were talking about vegetarianism again.  Jimmy's giving me that look.  I'm the anti-vegetarian guy.  I'm like, I should do this.  See, because before, we were.  So, I never put, I don't think rubber is very common.  Isn't it hard to get on?  No, you put on lots of lube, and you slide it on.  It slips right on like a second skin, and it feels great against the skin. 
[03:26:00]  You get really sweaty underneath it, right?  No.  No?  No, you put on lots of lube, and it's pretty comfortable.  Oh, you got to put lube on.  Yeah, you have to use lube on it.  And then you slide it on, and because it's so thin, I feel like you actually lose body heat  through it when you have it on for long periods of time.  Yeah.  Initially, you might sweat, but then it just stops.  Yeah, because it doesn't seem like it would be porous enough to let the sweat out or anything.  But it's not like wearing a wetsuit or a dry suit where it's insulated.  It's completely non-insulated, so it's actually quite chilly to wear on a cold night.  And then what's the turn-on with rubber? 
[03:26:30]  The smell, the taste, the feel, the way it looks, shiny.  And the fact that you can't get anything on you.  Yeah.  Can you see genitals through it?  Well, yes, actually, the most popular sets on my member site, jadevixen.com, involved  me unzipping the crotch of my catsuit.  So I'm completely covered in latex, but I'm showing off my crotch or pulling my boobs out.  Zipper in the appropriate place.  How do you go to the bathroom in it, though?  I mean, the zipper, I guess.  For a guy, they have one in the zipper, too?  Well, I just unzip, and I stand up and pee.  But does a guy's suit have that, too? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, and you could even pick where you want the zippers to go.  That would kind of be fun.  Somebody with colitis has it in the back.  Yeah, I guess it's more or less where you want the zipper to go.  It's a philosophy bag.  That would kind of be fun to get into a latex suit without a zipper, though, and just pee  in it.  Yeah.  Just make it fill up like a water balloon.  Then you can marinate in your own piss.  Yeah.  That would kind of be warm and fun.  Yeah, for the first five minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you'd just poke pinholes in it and walk around.  It's crowded.  Then you're sitting in cold, wet pee.  No, it doesn't sound like that.  No, you put a little hole in the bottom of the foot so it just leaks out into your shoes. 
[03:27:30]  It's kind of hot.  Yeah, what kind of shoes do you wear with the rubber stuff?  Um, very, very spiky, tall, high heels.  Okay.  How about the guy?  Because I have very, very bad...  I need orthotics for my shoes.  No, I don't like men in high heels.  No, no, no.  He wears men's like a boot, like a riding boot or a military-styled boot.  Okay.  I would wear a latex with my gut and my...  I'm not in great shape.  Get a girdle.  No, I can't do that.  Latex is very telling, I would assume. 
[03:28:00]  Of course you do.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, it is.  You're pretty much seeing everything there.  Yeah.  I would look really lumpy in latex.  Would ya?  I would look like a snake that's eaten.  So...  So you would wear the rubber up to where?  The neck?  I guess like a collar type thing and then an officer's hat?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I'm kind of getting that look.  At home, though, you know, I'll put on a catsuit, I'll put gloves on, and my catsuits usually  have feet, so I'm really encased, and then I'll put on a hood.  And what's the catsuit made of?  Rubber.  A rubber catsuit? 
[03:28:30]  Yes, rubber.  Always rubber.  Always rubber.  You are so into rubber.  It covers the face.  What is this, like a hole in the nose?  No, well, I like...  Well, the ones that I wear and that I like to wear cover the face, but have the eyes open  and have the lips open.  Oh, really?  When your lips bulge out, like puff up?  Yes, they do.  Oh, God.  Wow, that's like the gimp shit.  It's the hot.  That's kind of like the gimp.  I gotta go again.  Pulp fiction stuff.  I have to leave.  The rubber...  You gotta go.  I would like that, because there's something perverted about that.  I like outlined genitals.  I like the mask.  I love the silence after that, and I was hoping it would continue. 
[03:29:00]  I wasn't even kidding.  No, no, I know.  It just...  It really just needed that punctuation of nothingness just to sit there and go, I like puffed-out genitals.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlining.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Outlined.  Yeah.  Oh, that was hot.  Yeah.  It was a great film.  That was so hot.  Good one.  That's a great one.  You haven't seen that?  No.  Boy, does Rocco do some fucking in that one.  I know.  I didn't see that one.  Yeah.  Good one.  That's a travesty.  You need to go get that.  That's a good porno movie.  Yeah? 
[03:29:30]  They did a musical to it in Vegas.  Did they really?  Yeah.  If it was, like, mainstream version, you would equate it to, like, popular as The Godfather?  It actually won a real Oscar, a legitimate Oscar.  I'm kidding.  No, it did win.  Thanks, God, you told me you're kidding.  It did win a lot of...  Thanks, God.  Thanks, God.  You told me you're kidding.  Thanks, God, you told me you're kidding, dude.  She was rubbing off on you.  What the hell happened?  I think half my tongue fell off.  This is gorgeous girls naked.  We're all flubbing, flubbing.  Oh, she's showing a...  Whoa.  Wow.  Fashionista.  Oh, my God, she's gorgeous. 
[03:30:00]  Look at her hip, so it's killing me.  That's, like, old school hip.  That's why...  Old school hips?  Old school hips?  What does that mean, Bob?  What is that?  You got, like, birthing hips?  Child-bearing hips.  Like, what?  Just an old, you know, just an old...  She's got beautiful hips.  I like her hips.  Prairie mom wrapped in rubber.  Prairie mom, thanks.  Wrapped in rubber.  With a mask over, just a mouth flicking.  Like on the Waltons.  Just swollen lips pulsing out of her...  She's riding into town on a buckboard looking for a bolt of gingham and a bag of rock candy. 
[03:30:30]  Jeez, what are you looking at, Danny?  Danny punched up some type of a pornography.  This is Fashionistas.  I don't like the one.  I think it might be the sequel.  I don't like the original.  Come on, the original.  Belladonna.  Belladonna.  Go for Belladonna.  Do Belladonna with the mask on for Fashionistas.  Unbelievable.  I got the trailer.  It looks like they're lapping valves in an engine.  Can you move that, Danny?  Can you move that mic?  Thanks.  No.  It's blocking the asshole.  You're friends with Belladonna, right?  Yeah.  It's kind of like an exhaust tip up her ass.  Belladonna.  Whoa, what is this?  Wow.  Wow.  That girl's in rubber? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, this is like a real production.  Yeah, this is really...  Because he's a dancer.  Saliano's a dancer, so he wanted it to be like a real, you know...  Oh, really?  The musical was all about dancing.  Boy, you know a lot, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You really do.  Look at that.  Look at that mask.  Jimmy's an expert on schmutz.  Oh, that was a butt plug with a tail on it.  How funny is that?  Damn.  There was some good fucky in this, though.  These outfits, these rubber outfits were hot.  You're right, little fat pussies were sticking out.  Yeah.  And Rocco puts it to two women.  He's got his foot in one girl's face.  Oh, the other Rocco.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  That's great.  That's nice.  How did you get into the wonderful world of posing nude?  Posing nude?  Yeah.  I started modeling.  Oh, what's with that mic?  Oh, you've got to get the mic closer.  I'm sorry.  We'll switch the mic.  Why?  You switch mics to the one that doesn't work.  Okay, cool.  Oh, Jesus.  So, can you hear me?  Yes.  Or have I totally vanished?  Well, I started getting dressed up and going out clubbing in New York in the 90s when I  was in high school when a club kid and being horrible.  Where'd you live?  I grew up in New York. 
[03:32:00]  Where in New York?  Like one of the boroughs or in Manhattan?  In Queens.  Okay.  And, but yeah, I spent my youth, misspent youth, going out clubbing and dressing up in  outfits and being a club kid.  And then later, I just, I don't know.  I've always liked getting naked.  Really?  Yes.  She's got such a cool, fun personality.  I know.  So, you just liked getting naked for people?  I'm an exhibitionist.  No, for farm animals.  No, for farm animals.  Exactly.  I only strip for cats and dogs.  That really did come out like a dumbass question.  That was a good question. 
[03:32:30]  I meant for just general population?  You would go out to clubs and just take your clothes off?  No, I would wear skin-tight outfits, actually.  Okay.  With lots revealing, but always on.  You must have been getting hit on a lot at the clubs, huh?  Yes.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  So then, how'd you go from that to, you know, penthouse?  Actually, it was really weird.  I really didn't model nude for a good number of years.  I was in school full-time, and then I decided, you know what?  Like, it's now or never.  Before I get old and saggy, I might as well take some great pictures so I can, you know, 
[03:33:00]  just have them 30 years from now.  I can look back and say, you know what?  That was me.  Exactly.  Before they get 18.  This is grandma.  Oh, I don't like children.  Good girl.  Yeah.  Don't want to ravage that.  That's why she makes you wear a bag.  What a trooper.  Yeah, I know.  No, get a vasectomy.  Really?  Oh, damn.  Vasectomy, then it's cool.  Get snipped.  Go in raw.  Do you like peeing on people?  Yes, I do.  You really do?  I like peeing standing up.  I can write my name in the snow.  Really?  I like peeing, yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Do you like, but if you're pissing in somebody's mouth, though, you don't want to stand over them.  That's too, you can even hold your eyes and stuff.  I have really good aim.  Want to find out?  If I wasn't in a relationship, I would, but believe me, I'd take a whole gallon of it.  But I don't.  It's good to see you taking a moral stand.  Yeah.  Good for you.  I don't think my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  No, I just, I got a girlfriend who would be very angry if I drink piss.  If she pisses in your mouth when she's dehydrated, does that make you dehydrated?  Hmm.  It's like one of those philosophical questions. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  It's completely inappropriate for this.  I like it.  I like when a girl squats over my mouth.  I don't like when she stands.  Do you like it when she, like, sits on her face and pisses down her throat?  I like it a lot, yeah, but not, but one mouthful at a time, not.  Oh, no, you have to have very good bladder control to do that.  Yeah.  Shh.  Yeah.  Drop, drop, drop.  Do you like looking at, looking at it coming out?  The way it is is this.  I like it where she's out with my face and your mouth is open and it's like a very soft  lock on the outside of the lips.  Very soft mouth. 
[03:34:30]  It's like a very soft connection.  Yeah.  It's not like the space station docking, like, like a shitty science, the shitty science  science fiction film where it kind of, if I get a break, you can stop, Travis.  Can we please hear what Bob just said?  A shitty, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy,  Hold on.  Bob Voss said something.  I'm so tired, dude.  I'm sorry.  I don't know how you do this every day.  My eyes are hurting.  I can't fucking talk.  Your eyes are hurting?  Yeah, I don't, I'm so tired. 
[03:35:00]  Oh my God, she's naked.  Oh my God.  Can you hear what Bob just said?  Yeah, you got that?  Sorry, sorry.  Yeah?  Wow.  Travis is hard at work.  Yeah, he's got, he'll get it.  Great.  Look at her fucking nipples.  Beautiful dark nipples.  Oh wow, now the bra's off.  Oh yeah.  Thank God.  I got it if you want.  Okay, yeah.  All right, let's hear.  Hold on.  It's like a very soft connection.  Yeah?  It's not like the space station docking.  Like, like, a shitty science, a shitty science fiction film. 
[03:35:30]  Bobby.  Oh my God, man.  A shitty science fiction.  I thought you said Einstein in there.  Yeah, shitty science fiction.  Might rain halfway through.  It's a, just stop.  I'm tired.  My eyes hurt.  I just gotta.  So you, so yeah, I love, I do like it.  It's very sexy.  But again, I like to.  Do you engage in that with your girlfriend?  I have, yeah, sure.  Every girl I've dated, I've had to do that.  Wow.  Every girl?  Wow, really?  Yeah, most of them do it. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, that's something.  Most of them will do it on some level.  Like, here's how you start them off by going, all right, look, when you pee, just don't  wipe.  Just don't wipe.  Let me lick it.  So they would piss, and then they would just come in the bedroom and sit on my face, and  I would just clean it.  There's some reason for this.  This is easing women into golden showers 101.  Yeah, that's the easy way.  Keep going.  Come on.  It is, yeah.  And where does it go to?  You don't want to freak them out.  You don't want to freak them out by going too direct, so you just tell them, let me  just lick the piss off you when you're done.  Yeah, you don't say it like that.  You're like, let me clean you.  Let me smell it.  Let me clean you.  I want to taste you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you do? 
[03:36:30]  Just never buy toilet paper?  And she's like, Jim.  And you go, I got it.  I would say, just don't wipe.  I'm honest.  I would say, don't wipe.  Yeah, let me take care of it.  I got it.  No toilet paper.  They call them old Charmin Tongue Norton.  Yeah, Mr. Ripple.  Whipple.  Sorry.  Whipple.  Sorry.  Mr. Ripple.  Mr. Ripple.  That's Anthony.  Mr. Ripple.  Because he drinks.  Mr. Ripple.  Jesus.  I need a nap. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You need a nap?  Come on.  Mr. Whipple.  We got to take the pants off.  God, that is funny.  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  What do I get for it?  Whatever you want.  Her little fucking kooky laugh makes me.  That's racist.  You smile.  Not.  I said.  Oh, shit.  That was so wrong.  Bobby is fucking just. 
[03:37:30]  Goddamn train.  Bobby, do I have you tongue tied today?  Yes.  Baby, you do, man.  You do.  You do.  With the birthing hips, right?  Are you from a traditional Asian family?  Because this seems to be a line of work that wouldn't really go well with your traditional.  Yes, I am.  But at this point, it's like I was born and raised in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I understand that.  But sometimes the pants can be a little like, eh.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Well, what are you going to do?  It's my life, you know?  Hey.  Good.  Good for you.  Take those clothes off.  I live my life for me, not for anybody else.  Good.  Are they supportive or no?  To some degree, yes.  Have they seen this stuff or they just don't want to know?  They don't want to know.  Actually, they've seen a lot of my recent stuff.  Are they selling like hack versions of it?  No, they're not into it.  I can say that.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  I mean, like, you mean bootlegs?  Yeah, bootlegs of her stuff.  Because of China, you mean?  You're crazy. 
[03:38:30]  Wait, explain it.  I have no idea.  Explain it, Bobby.  What?  I don't know.  Bobby, what does that mean?  Bobby is just totally bamboozled today.  I mean, it's like, stop paying attention to anything.  I'm trying to pay attention.  I can't.  Okay, I'll put the breasts away.  No, don't put them away.  You have a very nice vagina, too.  I had to walk out.  I looked at it once and I was pretty.  Can I look for a second?  Just a quick peek.  I don't know.  Are you going to hold a cup for me to pee in?  Yes.  Oh, damn.  I'll hold a cup to pee in, yeah.  Yeah?  Sure.  I can do that on air?  Every couple has their boundaries.  I have a latte you can piss in. 
[03:39:00]  Will you drink it?  I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  Wow.  She's a trooper.  Oh, she's great.  Would you ever piss in a cup and then hold it to somebody's mouth and make them drink  it?  That would be hot.  Yeah.  It's non-consensual.  I guess it could be hot, but I really would rather someone say, oh, please.  No, no.  They want to drink it, but you just make, not that you're force-feeding them, but you're  kind of just, uh, they.  They, meaning Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, they.  They.  Well, I think putting it in a cup.  I have this friend.  I think putting it in a cup.  What are you there? 
[03:39:30]  That really likes urine in his mouth.  I think putting it in a cup, you lose a lot of the temperature.  But it's like, the best thing about, like, piss is that it's the same temperature as your  body.  So it's really warm and wet.  And if you put it in a cup, you've lost a couple of degrees to the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there's something about the cup.  Drinking piss out of cups.  Scientific facts.  Yeah.  One girl I dated, I would have her piss in a cup in the car and then I would make her  tip her hand and make me drink it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was so naughty.  Oh, your poor car.  The holster in your car must have smelled, honey.  No, she was at good aim and she would squat outside the door a little bit and fucking 
[03:40:00]  whiz into a cup.  And then fucking, I would make her tip it to my mouth like Naughty Boy Sip.  I'm glad you moved on to Pinkberry.  Wow.  You have done some fucked up shit that, like, just isn't, I'm not going to say normal,  but it's not normal.  But, like, there's got to be a reason for it.  It's not even the fucking planet of normal.  This isn't just, like...  It's just pee.  I love that you're on the air hours a day for years and there's still new shit that  comes up all the time.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:40:30]  Like, I didn't know the cup thing.  Really?  Like, you're sipping tea.  Yeah.  Like a gentleman.  Like a proper gent.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you enjoy finger sandwiches?  A nice, fine.  Finger sandwiches up his ass as he drinks fucking tea out of a nice cup.  Yes.  How wonderfully revolved.  She would put a pig in a blanket by her penis.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are we just fucking off everything we're trying to say?  I know.  We're flustered.  I'm putting clothes on, then.  You guys can't keep it together. 
[03:41:00]  I didn't mean to say that.  If you took your panties off, we'd be fine.  A cocktail prank by your penis.  I mean...  Yeah.  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  She's such a nice body.  That is...  She has plump little vaginal lips, too.  A little pussy lipstick on the...  Oh, she's juicy.  What about the...  Heine...  She's got a great...  Yeah, look at that butt.  Boy, I wouldn't mind to...  Pull down the little...  If you could pull down the G-string there a little...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get that lower...  The lower back kind of a thing.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, yeah.  And you can see the lips from the back.  It's fucking hot.  I like that.  Yeah, a lot.  Wow. 
[03:41:30]  Look at the hair, too.  Can you tickle your ass with your hair?  No.  She has long...  Yeah.  Who'd want to see that?  Me?  Really?  Yeah, I'm like a...  Look at her hair.  Squatting up in a car in the wintertime, pissing in a cup to give you tea.  Oh, damn.  I know, but you're like fucking Lenny from Mice and Men.  That is...  That's pretty good.  I like that.  She has nice fat lips, man.  Oh, that's juicy.  I like that.  It's my favorite thing.  Is it?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, that is...  Wow.  You are, um...  Naked.  Yeah, she's nice.  They're like dark.  That's good. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Who's going to catch them?  I will.  Oh, Jimmy will catch them in his mouth.  Yeah.  Her laugh is hilarious.  Great minds think alike.  I tell you that.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like when you lean there.  She has a nice...  Yeah, she can do something with her legs.  She, like, you know, does that.  It makes it look kind of...  And the vagina kind of tilts.  It looks like the vagina's thinking.  Like, all right.  I think a chin scratcher.  What is she saying?  I thought only men thought with a small head, you know?  No.  She's got a beautiful, uh... 
[03:42:30]  Oof.  Wow.  Now we're just gawking over a nude...  We're basically...  This is just now gawking.  We're just staring at a vagina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, at least I have pretty girl parts, you know?  Yeah.  It's very nice.  There's nothing worse than an ugly pussy.  Yeah.  Or a small one.  Yuck.  What?  You don't like a little small one?  Fucking...  I'll actually blow a girl out of my room.  You don't like your nose to team?  You don't like your nose to team?  You don't like your nose to team?  You don't like your nose to team?  Boo.  Boo.  This is prior to the girlfriend, I hope.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'm actually a pretty good boyfriend.  I think you are.  You know?  Yeah.  She's got a great butt. 
[03:43:00]  That's what I tell myself.  Like, this has come that I'd be forcing on her hair if it wasn't somebody else.  Oh, my gosh.  What do you consider, like, a small vagina, though, Jim?  Is it stuff like you want...  You need puffiness?  It's different than what you consider a small vagina.  Can you show us a picture of this, Jim?  Yeah, I don't know what a vagina is.  A vagina.  You said a small vagina.  You're an ass.  It's like Ricky Gervais, but a vagina.  I have to go.  Where are you going?  Oh, what do you got to do?  Oh, you got a plane to catch. 
[03:43:30]  I have a flight to catch.  Oh, you're leaving?  Oh.  Jimmy Norton is going to be on.  I'll be on a tonight show tomorrow night.  I'm doing a segment, so I have to go out today.  Yeah.  But I'll be on with Trump and the Jonas Brothers.  They're pissing in your mouth.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Hopefully I'll treat.  And my Forgotta tickets are on sale for July 2nd, 3rd, and I'll be at Caroline.  And it's June 3 through 6th.  So I'll see you guys.  All right, Jimmy.  Have fun tomorrow.  I'm sorry I can't be here.  I know.  This was a very last minute booking. 
[03:44:00]  I found out yesterday.  It's good.  I wish you were going to be here for Cherry Darts.  Yeah, me too.  We're not going to have our own Jimmy Norton.  We will have Florentine and Colin Quinn.  You know.  We'll be in.  Well, I'm probably going to make a Sunday.  Everyone does a Colin.  Have you heard Jay Moore do Colin?  Yeah, Jay's Colin.  Jay's Colin is funny.  He's fucking hilarious.  He's funnier than Colin.  He's got the material and everything.  He's really good. 
[03:44:30]  Pride.  Yeah.  You know what?  Fuck it.  What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  Break off backs?  Well, you need Jimmy here with this shit.  You need Jimmy here because he's.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He knows.  You guys are here.  Everybody else is.  Yeah, you guys are confused.  Tomorrow Jimmy's not going to be here.  Now it's going to be uncomfortable.  I'm just going to be staring at her.  I have nothing to say.  I'm tired.  Let's ask her some questions.  She's got a personality.  What else were we doing when Jimmy was sitting there staring at her?  All right.  See you, Greg.  Good seeing you.  I'll see you.  Nice seeing you, brother.  Jimmy, take a tizzy.  Bye, Jimmy.  See you, Jimmy. 
[03:45:00]  Hope you have a safe flight.  Thank you.  Me too.  No, you just say safe flight, not hope you have a safe flight.  See you.  I'm so scared.  I said, hold up on that.  Hey, to not have a safe flight, then we'll see what happens.  Chip, you don't have such a safe flight.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure.  See you later.  Bye.  See you later, Chip.  See you, Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy.  Hope you drink lots of pee.  Yeah.  It's a little order on the plane.  Could you piss in this for me, please?  Thank you.  Can I drink this before takeoff?  I could never drink piss.  I don't know what he went through. 
[03:45:30]  He's told stories of his youth and stuff and always liking the smell of...  He's talking about girls in school.  He says it smells like popcorn.  Yeah, the first encounter you have with a girl is usually some innocent little, you show  me yours, I'll show you mine thing.  His was, you know, take a piss and sit on his face.  Yeah.  He makes it sound like it was all very innocent, but I don't know.  I don't buy it.  There's something going on.  Yeah.  And it was pre-drugs or anything.  You know, like all that piss and stuff.  He started with a little ecstasy, weird shit happens.  You kind of ease into it that way. 
[03:46:00]  But he's full-blown.  No, this was when, you know, fucking his chocolate milk phase as a kid.  It's yoo-hoo.  This is nothing.  I don't know where it comes from.  Is there always a fucked up, dysfunctional thing in a childhood that leads to any kind  of extreme, or not even extreme, but fetish behavior, don't you think, or not really?  I don't think so.  Really?  Fetish behavior?  Something like that?  I think any behavior you're engaging as an adult.  You block the naked girl body.  How about you get hypersexual?  Thanks.  I'd rather look at your back.  I'm trying to get out of your way.  Thanks.  Well, I'm trying.  Thanks, sir.  That's what I was trying to do.  I just couldn't...  I mean, I think environment has something to do with your personality and what you're interested 
[03:46:30]  in and what you're not interested in.  You need that mic up there.  Yeah.  Or, I think your environment has something to do with it, but I think life experiences  are another, though, you know?  Yeah, but like, as you're growing up, something's got to happen that makes you go, I love feet.  I just love feet.  All I want to do is jerk off on feet.  Yeah.  Something's got to happen.  I cannot empath...  Wow, you're catching up.  Hey, look at that.  I'm rubbing on everybody.  Hey, I can't even look at my boobs and I'm stumbling. 
[03:47:00]  They're pumping gas into this room or something.  Or something.  Something.  Yeah, the I want to jerk off all over your feet thing, I would not get off on that.  That's a little odd, right?  Yeah.  And then there's other kind of fetishes people have with armpits and fucking just...  It's also expensive.  It's expensive to have these.  I knew a girl that answered an ad on Craigslist or something.  A guy wanted to jerk off on her feet.  It was like 800 bucks.  You can't just jerk off on feet.  If that's what you like, it costs money.  Yeah, you've got to be committed. 
[03:47:30]  I really want it.  And don't you think that you could just stay home, jerk off, and realize how much you save?  Jerk off on your own foot in a mirror?  Yeah.  No, because the guys have hairy feet.  Yeah.  And no toenail polish, so come on.  Or speak for yourself.  Print some out from Google images and then jerk off on them.  No, the guy probably likes foot jobs.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  He probably likes foot jobs.  The foot job is the dumbest looking thing.  That is so repulsive.  That, like, arched foot looks like a monkey is jerking you off. 
[03:48:00]  It really is kind of like, what can I get her to do?  Yeah.  What can I get her to do moment right there?  All right.  I bet I could get her to jerk me off on her feet.  Let me try.  That's sick.  So, University of Pennsylvania, that's a good school?  I was there for graduate school.  I was out of nowhere.  You went to the University of Pennsylvania?  For graduate school, yes.  For a PhD in engineering?  Yes.  Really?  How do you apply that to your current?  I got really burnt out, actually, in school. 
[03:48:30]  And it really...  I just realized, you know what?  Life's too short to sit in an office cooped up and working 80 hours a week.  And I wanted to have fun.  Damn.  So, you did work in an office?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, bum those guys out.  The engine is fucking left.  Yeah.  You seem genuine.  You seem super happy.  Like a happiest person.  What a sweet, happy person.  You're not medicated on anything?  You don't take antidepressants?  No issues?  Ask Lainey.  Of course not.  No, I'm not.  I'm not saying that.  I wish I could be that.  I'm just happy to be alive, to be honest with you.  I mean, it's like... 
[03:49:00]  It's like if you're going to live a miserable life and hate everything around you, why are you here?  Well, maybe because you have kids and you've got to still support.  Maybe because you're trying to fucking keep it together.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Hang on, Greg.  Hold on, Greg.  It's the time of the show.  Hold on, Greg.  Oh, fuck it.  Wow.  So, engineering.  So, what, would you sit there looking all hot, drawing up cogs or something?  No.  Cogs.  That's a cog.  Picture sketching a cog.  No, I wasn't a mechanical engineer. 
[03:49:30]  Sketching hogs.  What kind of hog?  You're dunce.  So, what kind of engineering?  I actually did like a science degree for undergraduate.  I did chemistry and biochemistry as a double major.  And then I did materials engineering for graduate school.  But I did not pursue that path.  I really didn't like it very much.  Obviously.  You're sitting here naked.  Just saying.  I think, like, the reason why I'm so happy is I'm doing exactly what I've always wanted  to do.  I'm, like, living the dream.  And I'm really enjoying my life.  What's your boyfriend do?  What's my boyfriend do? 
[03:50:00]  That's private.  Oh, damn.  I didn't say where he does it, the exact address and his name.  I mean, he...  How is that fucking...  Like, what line?  Why are you going to be so hard-hitting with this interview, Bobby?  Yeah, what are you...  The fuck?  60 minutes, you fuck?  What is my boyfriend do?  He dresses up in rubber outfits with me.  So he doesn't have a job?  No, he has a job.  Is he, like, super muscly dude?  No, he's not super muscly.  No?  I like men that are thin and lean.  Bobby is really, like...  She won't answer my questions.  She won't answer my questions. 
[03:50:30]  He's coming up with random questions that are not relevant to our conversation because  he doesn't want to look at my boobs.  Can you just look at me and ask your question?  Yeah, why are you looking at me, Bobby?  Bobby, why can't you look?  Bobby, just look at me and ask your question.  I did.  I asked your question, sweetie.  I know, but you're not following our...  I'm very tired.  So where does the money come from?  Just from, like, online stuff?  People go onto your website?  Yes.  And they just pay, like, a monthly fee or something like that?  I have a monthly fee on my site.  And that's where the money comes from?  I get lots of photos.  Yeah.  And then the rest of it's just lifestyle stuff you just do for fun? 
[03:51:00]  No, I also do modeling jobs as well for Penthouse Magazine and other publications and also  for photographers.  I do a lot of portrait photography for portrait photographers and a lot of art nudes for gallery  exhibitions, which are much more shadowy.  My face doesn't show in most of those.  Yeah, yeah, that artsy black and white kind of curved.  A lot of...  Yeah.  A lot of bending.  A lot of bending.  Like, positions like this?  Oh, I like that one.  Hold it.  That's my favorite. 
[03:51:30]  I do photography with my iPhone.  Please hold it.  Really?  I thought photography?  My iPhone, yes.  Then I put it in the vault.  Use it later.  Vault.  I hate when the vault's open and I get a text because it shuts the vault.  It sucks.  You're thumbing through the picture.  Oh, that's good.  And someone goes, yeah, it is kind of good, I guess.
