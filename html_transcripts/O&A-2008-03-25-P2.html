<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the movie *Cloverfield*, featuring several cast members in studio.  The conversation covered the film's premise, shaky-cam filming style, improvisation, secrecy surrounding production (including code names like "Cheese" and "Chocolate Outrage"), low budget ($25 million), and impressive special effects.  The cast members also discussed their previous roles and experiences filming *Cloverfield*. Comedian Brian Regan was a guest during this portion of the show.  The conversation with Regan included crude humor about driving habits and anecdotes about bizarre driving incidents, along with a discussion of his musical preferences (Pink Floyd).

The show then transitioned to "The Money Snatch," a contest where nude contestants collected cash scattered in the studio.  The hosts attempted to recruit contestants via phone calls, revealing a "twist" (involving a satchel or other items for collecting money) to each potential participant separately.  Several potential contestants were screened, some declining due to the nudity requirement, age, or the undisclosed twist. Three contestants were eventually confirmed.  A significant portion of the show focused on "Stalker Patty," a recurring caller facing eviction if she participated in "Money Snatch" due to objections from her roommates. The hosts, along with several callers, engaged in a highly contentious and vulgar discussion about Patty's situation, her autonomy, the legality of eviction, and the morality of "Money Snatch".  A phone call with Patty's landlord added to the chaotic and confrontational nature of the segment. This segment also involved a phone call with Patty's siblings, Kim and Gary, escalating into a vulgar and insulting exchange, involving numerous personal attacks.  Despite the potential consequences, Patty decided to participate in "Money Snatch." A fundraising effort for Patty ensued, with pledges from the show's staff and callers to assist her with finding new housing.  The show's websites, opieandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com, were mentioned.

The "Money Snatch" segment continued, with Opie and Anthony offering Patty $906 to shave her head again. Following a heated call with her landlord's daughter, she accepted. The show featured other potential contestants including Sandy from New Hampshire and Ron from the Ron and Fez show, along with guest appearances from Paul Mercurio (promoting his show) and technical difficulties that resulted in frustrated exchanges between the hosts and the technical staff.  Other details about "Money Snatch" were revealed: a five-minute time limit, a hidden "twist", and the possibility of additional prizes.  Several female contestants called in, discussing their strategies. The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive and crude humor throughout this segment. The presence of "Jamaican Mike" and the "awesome cam" (showing money hanging from the ceiling) were also mentioned.

The "O&A Money Snatch" game was then described in detail. Ten naked women competed to collect $1,500 in cash with restrictions on where they could hold the money.  A specially marked bill earned the finder front-row Kid Rock tickets.  The broadcast included listener calls, a discussion of a date between Patty and a man described as a "complete tool," and speculation about the sexual orientation of Al.  The game's execution was detailed with vulgar commentary from Opie and Anthony, a leaf blower being used to increase the chaos, and a guest appearance by Jim Cook from Sam Adams brewery, bringing illegal beer.  After the game, a controversy arose regarding Colleen, who allegedly violated the rules using string.  She was disqualified from the final count but allowed to keep the money she had collected. Jim Cook gave her additional money.  Robin was declared the winner. The segment concluded with the counting of the money collected.  There were complaints from contestants about cheating and rule-bending among other participants.

The show concluded with a discussion of their transition from commercial radio to XM Satellite Radio. They played a clip of a phone conversation with their general manager, Ken Stevens, arguing about the station airing XM advertisements despite their objections.  They also discussed the radio industry's response to the rise of satellite radio, highlighting the hypocrisy of radio executives dismissing satellite radio while secretly investing in or listening to it. Audio clips highlighting this, including Bon Jovi commercials, were played.  The final segment involved a humorous, albeit vulgar, discussion of a news story about a chiropractor who allegedly spanked and sexually assaulted a patient. Audio clips of the chiropractor's arrest and comments were played. Guest appearances included Joe, Bill Burr, and Pat Cooper.  The broadcast ended with sexually suggestive and crude language unrelated to the main topics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Enemy Show. 
[00:00:30]  The Enemy Show. 
[00:01:00]  The Enemy Show.  I'll throw my waist on you. 
[00:01:30]  It's the worst of opium.  Boring!  No one is listening!  Oh, what a creepy mess.  It's just bad.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, we're just horrible dullards.  We got the gang from Cloverfield in studio.  So most of us saw Cloverfield in the studio, and we all loved it.  Oh, that's great.  We're happy.  We all loved it.  I wasn't a fan of the shaky camera work.  Who was behind the camera?  That was me.  Oh, boy, do I want to slap you. 
[00:02:00]  That's great.  Yeah, hold the camera stand.  My goal was to make people have a visceral reaction to the situation of a large attack on New York and have motion sickness.  They got motion sickness.  Good.  So if those two things happen, then I feel like I did my job.  Right, exactly.  Now, I've been thinking about it ever since I saw the movie that Jay Abrams and the rest of the gang behind this movie, they were very aware that the shaky camera work would affect some people.  But I think that's also part of the experience.  You should probably sit in the back of the theater.  I know.  I guess that's what we should tell people because where Jimmy sat, he wasn't affected. 
[00:02:30]  It was in the final, the last row I saw.  You know, take some gravel or something.  You know, that's good advice, though, because a lot of people are going to go see the movie this weekend.  If you're a wimp like me, go to the back of the theater and it might not affect you.  It's not as bad if you sit in the back.  It really isn't.  I think you also, you know, you get into it.  Like, once you've seen it for about 20 minutes, you sort of get used to the way that it's shot and hopefully don't get sick during this.  Sick during the week.  There's people going over with patches behind their ears and those dumb wristbands. 
[00:03:00]  There's going to be five people seated and like 300 crammed into the back like a porno theater.  Those guys cruising each other with coats.  It has that effect of a porno theater, I think.  I really liked it, though, man.  It's like I had heard just like, all right, it's a monster movie kind of.  You didn't know what to expect.  And I'm very rarely on the edge of my seat when I watch a film.  They're small seats, though, too.  They're very just the edges.  They really weren't tiny.  I was kind of, you know, my ass was hanging the popcorn on the floor.  But it was really, everything to me was unexpected about it. 
[00:03:30]  I had no idea what the thing looked like.  I had no idea where it was going to go.  And we're obviously not going to give away the ending.  But let's just say it wasn't a typical Hollywood thing.  So it was really, really interesting film.  The whole movie is not typical Hollywood.  You guys want to explain the basic premise of Cloverfield?  Somebody, just to get everyone on board?  Yeah, it's about a group of friends who were throwing a going-away party for a buddy there.  She's going to Japan.  And then some shit goes down.  Oh, hey.  Oh, whoops.  Or that.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's like, hey, good morning, good morning, New York City.  Sorry. 
[00:04:00]  That's all right.  So, baby.  Can't say it again.  And we just got the delay.  So, basically, there's a going-away party.  Yeah, there's a going-away party.  There's an explosion in Manhattan.  We don't know what's going on.  And you're following this group of friends as they go through the city trying to survive this night.  So it's this kind of survivor movie.  And what you talk about, I mean, it is intense.  It's an experience, I think, more than maybe a lot of movies, firsthand experience to go through the movie.  And what we try to do while making it is you just really stay true to the idea that that is a character holding the camera. 
[00:04:30]  He is there with it.  So, you know, as much as we want to tell the story of what the movie is, you can't too conveniently catch the moments.  And it has to feel like he's really there.  He's whipping his head to see what you're seeing.  And they didn't have to cheat as much as you'd think to get that video camera feeling, which I loved.  Because it's a movie, so you still have to explain exactly what's going on and what happens.  And you have to show footage.  But it really did feel like a guy is videotaping, which I thought was brilliant the way that was shot.  Whoever the director of photography was was brilliant.  A guy really was videotaping because I shot about a third of the film. 
[00:05:00]  I actually held the camera throughout it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think we all did.  Yeah.  At one point or another.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a really, you know, we tried to convey that and we didn't really realistically.  And they really, they were strongly saying, sometimes I do shots and at the end of it, the director would comp and go, yeah, they just, it looked too good.  And these were.  That wouldn't look like that if you were spinning around and trying to catch something that just happened. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  We tried to make it look as real as we could.  It's amazing how much, like, I don't know why this movie has this really weird buzz around it.  Like, you don't hear as much about a movie before it comes out like this one.  It's like, I just remember driving on 10th Avenue and seeing it.  It's a great marketing.  The poster for it is really great.  So it immediately makes you want to know why is the Statue of Liberty headless?  You know, that's what the poster is.  Or she's a mess or whatever she is.  And it's like, it's really, really well marketed.  And I was interested in this movie before I'd ever seen a commercial for it just because of, like, the guerrilla marketing. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, there was some kind of, like, hype behind it before it came out.  And I read something that was really horrible that, thank God, didn't, you know, come to fruition for you guys.  It was like, the hype, is this the next Snakes on a Plane?  You're not.  Oh, yeah.  And I was like, oh, man.  We tried for that.  Yeah, you tried.  Originally, there were snakes attacking you.  Yeah.  It just didn't fit.  And we couldn't get Samuel L. Jackson to say, I want to get these motherfuckers out. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, we didn't, I think that was what all of us were worried about is that there's so much hype surrounding it.  And there's so many people on the internet talking about it, asking about it.  But when you finally see the movie, I think it lives up to the hype.  And it's different.  It's different than, I think even the trailer makes you think you're going to see this huge action film.  And it is, but it isn't at all.  It's not that movie where the president is like, we've got to figure out a way to take this thing down. 
[00:07:00]  You know, where's it from?  Get the military.  Like, no, that doesn't come into play.  It's much more about these six characters and how they deal with the craziest event you could imagine happening.  There was a great sense of isolation in the movie, which it was like, or panic, which I like.  Because most movies, again, maybe when they're shot like typical movies, don't give you that.  But there's like a thing where you go up to like Columbus Circle, and it was just creepy.  It was just a creepy, because I live right by there.  And it was like, ugh.  It was just a really nice effect to have, which most movies don't give you when they're shot. 
[00:07:30]  That's because we had no clue what was happening as we were doing it.  So, I mean, it was.  What was the script like?  Were you guys totally scripted?  They didn't tell you a lot?  You know, we improv'd so much of the film.  We ripped a bunch of stuff, and none of us saw the script before we signed on.  So we didn't, because it was so secretive.  Literally five days before we started filming is when we finally got to read a script.  And, I mean, the trailer was shot before we, the trailer came out in front of Transformers that everyone saw.  We were maybe two days into the actual filming of the movie at that point. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  And we just found out who we were playing.  And that trailer came out before the script had been finished.  Yeah.  You know, so it was very much the whole concept of this movie and the marketing campaign was that was at the outset.  They had that idea.  And then when we're figuring out the movie, it was kind of happening on the fly in a lot of ways.  It really was.  And we didn't, you know, we had no idea what, this is, it was a totally different approach to make, I mean, to shoot a teaser before you shoot the film.  That never happens. 
[00:08:30]  And so it was, I mean, it was exciting, and it was strange to find out that I wasn't going to be on camera at all.  That was exciting.  But when you were, it paid off nicely, though.  Yeah, it was.  That's right, yeah.  Really great shots.  You really cherish those two and a half minutes.  I think you really, really.  Take it all in, right?  Yeah, take all of it.  That's all I got.  That's all I want to give you.  All of you are pretty much just, we're kind of fighting your way up the ranks and trying to get gigs and stuff, which is kind of great that they didn't get any quote-unquote really big names for it, 
[00:09:00]  because then it's like an ensemble cast.  You're not concentrating just on one person.  Yeah, I think if anybody recognizable had been in the film, then it wouldn't have had that feeling of being as real as it was.  Yeah, you're just like, hey, he was in that other movie.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, if you can suspend your disbelief and believe that you are watching a tape that the government found, I think that's the ultimate experience of the movie that we tried to have.  So, yeah, you needed to have people that you don't really recognize.  And that's not going to happen if you have Jerry O'Connell in it.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, wait, he's the guy from Sliders. 
[00:09:30]  That's a great reference.  Sliders.  The subway tunnel scene.  Wow.  That was really, really good.  And it came in at, relatively speaking, pretty low budget for a movie of that scope.  You're wrecking New York.  I mean, that kind of takes a lot of money these days.  $25 million, she said, for the whole movie.  $25 million.  That's it.  Opie's got that in his pocket right now.  It pretty much all went to the special effects, I think.  Yeah, with the cast. 
[00:10:00]  If we didn't have any special effects.  It didn't go to the cast?  No.  If we didn't have special effects, we could have made it for like $2 million, probably.  They were good.  The effects were really good.  Those are the guys that really made that film, is the visual effects guys.  I mean, so much of it was done.  You'd step on the set.  I mean, like the Brooklyn Bridge stuff, they literally, they made a 100-foot section of  the walking path on the Brooklyn Bridge, and then it was just wrapped in a green screen.  And they literally went in hours beforehand and put little tiny orange Xs all over the 
[00:10:30]  place, because you have one camera that's whipping all over God's green earth, and there's  no way of having a perspective as to where you are.  And so they used those things to tell where they were when they laid in New York behind  it.  And it came, I mean, I was amazed at how flawlessly.  When you see it, and you've spent all this time working in these weird studios and stuff,  you're like, this is the movie I'm in?  This is crazy.  And when you're shooting these scenes, like in the subway, with a special effects scene 
[00:11:00]  partner, let's just say, you feel like a moron.  You know what I mean?  Flashing around or doing whatever.  But what I found is like, the bigger you go, you're giving a gift to the animator, because  then they can really use that.  But on the day, you feel like...  Oh, so you just got to act your way through that.  You just got to...  And then they added that other stuff in afterwards, obviously.  You're fighting nothing in real life.  Right, right.  Obviously.  Yeah.  We were discussing that.  It didn't seem like you guys were on a soundstage at all in this movie.  That's what's so crazy. 
[00:11:30]  I mean, this...  Were you on location in New York for some of the big scenes?  We only shot about a week and a half in New York.  Wow.  That's it.  You can't tell, though.  They did such a good job at filling in New York, the special effects people, because it's  unbelievable.  We shot a lot on soundstage, more than you would think.  Yeah, we had a lot.  I mean, a lot of it that you see and looks like New York was all done in Los Angeles.  I mean, it looks great.  Michael's right.  It was as much of a surprise for us to see the film, I think, as a lot of people have never  seen it before, because it just looks... 
[00:12:00]  You know, it's got the quality special effects of something like Transformers, but, you know,  it's completely different.  Was it a bunch of young, geeky, like, special effects guys?  They're all hot girls.  All hot girls.  Cool.  Just naked.  It's like the way they cut up cocaine.  They're all just nude in a room with gloves on.  Complets with gloves, doing cocaine, and creating giant special effects.  Because I've seen, like, people that are just amateurs, that do amazing work, and you can 
[00:12:30]  see it online, you know?  And it seems like that's the thing to do these days, to get some young hot shots that know  how to work some of these programs, and they do amazing stuff.  I mean, they definitely knew how to work the programs.  I mean, it was great.  Lock them in a room, and, you know, I mean, lock them in a room for six months.  I mean, the turnaround on this was insane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  For these guys, you know?  I mean, so they were...  Yeah, it would take years for a big-budget movie to pop out special effects like that.  I think what we're saying is we just, you know, this was, the movie was done on a weekend. 
[00:13:00]  That's how much Paramount carried out.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, why Cloverfield, by the way?  Like you're sitting here, and it's just up on the TV.  Yeah.  Just showing it.  One of the cast members is on that this morning, I think.  Would you say why Cloverfield?  Yeah, because obviously that has not much to do with the actual movie.  Well, yeah.  I mean, they bounced around.  And we had all these secretive names while we were filming so that nobody would know.  J.J. was very secretive about it, you know, coming from...  He wanted to control the info coming out, obviously.  Exactly.  And so for a while, it was called Cheese, and it was called Chocolate Outrage. 
[00:13:30]  Among Outrage, yeah.  Chocolate Outrage?  Yeah.  Live show.  Chocolate Outrage.  I wish they would have gone with Chocolate Outrage.  Yeah.  John Singleton film.  But yeah, I mean, they kind of finally, they settled on Cloverfield,  which was one of these code names, and it does, it has something to do with the film.  Once you see the opening of the film, you see how it relates to it.  But they actually, I don't care, they were going to call it Monstrous. 
[00:14:00]  That was an idea for it.  And they printed 10,000 posters that said Monstrous on it,  and the internet, like the geek mafia went crazy.  They were like, this has got to be fake.  They had our backs on that one, you know?  They really did, and so they changed the name,  and they didn't know what to do with these posters,  so they printed out like 10,000 more that said like, scary.  Terrifying.  Terrifying.  It's all adjectives.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:14:30]  Really scary.  Worth seeing.  Monstrous.  It's like the name of an HBO documentary on obesity.  Morbidity.  Morbid obesity.  Hey, it's funny, the effects are so important, because I saw The Mist.  We had, what was that guy's name that directed The Mist?  He's, whatever.  Darabont.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, right, Stephen King, yeah.  And he said he was on a very low budget,  and I think he was kind of preparing people,  because it was a really good movie,  and the characters were very interesting,  but the special effects were like,  and it was a really interesting movie, 
[00:15:00]  and it was like a sock puppet coming and attacking people.  It was horrendous.  You guys did a great job with the effects on that,  even though I know you didn't do it.  Well, half the budget went to special effects,  and that's, the thing is, I've been telling people,  it's like The Mist in that The Mist,  the thing that I liked the most about it was not the special effects.  It was what happens to these people when this thing, you know, occurs,  and that's what's cool about this movie,  is you really, it focuses on the characters. 
[00:15:30]  It's not, you know, the special effects and all that.  They're great, but that's not the focus of the film.  Yeah, the characters were really interesting people.  It was like, there were certain things that were shot, like, at a party.  Let's just say there's an argument between two people who slept together,  and the way it was shot, you get that information, though,  in a way that, like, you know, just a jackass filming at a party.  Oh, yeah, of course.  We've all been at that party.  I am that jackass.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, is there any talk about a sequel?  Not that we know of, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Not for most of us.  We've been filming it for four months now.  It's already in the works.  Yeah.  How would that work?  I don't know.  I think once you see this movie, you'll probably think the sequel goes out  the window pretty quickly.  There's a lot of unanswered questions.  I wasn't sure you wanted me to say that, but there's definitely, yeah,  I figured there could be a way to kind of, like, make another movie that  maybe answers some of these questions, and maybe they go a completely  different direction, actually film an actual Hollywood, quote, movie  with the same concept using the tape that we see in this movie.  Or a musical. 
[00:16:30]  Make it a musical.  I think they're taking the cast for American Pie 2.  The monster singing and fun, you know.  Hollywood.  What's, like, the biggest parts you've had?  You have to, have to.  He's winning.  What's the biggest, like, parts you've had before this movie?  Before this?  Yeah.  I'm not that big.  I've done a couple other movies.  Come on.  Say the one that you've done.  Come on.  What movie?  One called She's the Man.  Yes.  Yes.  Amanda Bynes.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Yes.  See, because I knew you looked familiar. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  Huge Amanda Bynes fan, by the way.  Yes.  What is She's the Man?  Is that a big film?  I don't know.  Well, it was a movie.  It was, like, a take on Twelfth Night with Amanda Bynes.  She dresses up as a guy on a soccer team, and, yeah.  It was more, like, for the young, like, the 12, 13-year-old.  The girls and tribulations of a girl dressed like a guy.  Comedy like that, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Difficult love.  Yeah.  Not a guy dressed like a girl, like you're used to.  No, no, no.  Cruising around the streets for you.  We've all made errors. 
[00:17:30]  Okay, so that was your biggest episode.  Yeah.  What about you?  I'm on this TV show.  It's called October Road on ABC.  Ooh.  Okay.  Yeah.  See, that's nothing to sneeze at, as they say.  How many episodes do you have?  The writer's strike is related.  You know, our writers are so amazing.  They wrote our whole 13-episode order.  So we're finished shooting now, and we have lots of more episodes there.  Yeah.  Because then you can't do rewrites.  If you have to shoot now, there's no rewrites.  Sure.  Either improv it, or it doesn't get shot right now. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, they got all of them out.  It was amazing.  Oh, cool.  How about yourself?  I had a film come out, I guess two summers ago, called Poseidon.  Oh, all right.  Big Giant Boat.  I think we heard about that one.  A bunch of chainsaw massacre, a bunch of other things.  Yeah.  Oh, did you get to talk to Arlie Ermey?  I did.  That's what took us out of the film, was him in that movie.  Right.  Because all you're seeing is, you know, Sergeant Hartman.  Yeah.  He did the entire full metal jacket.  Oh, he loves doing that speech. 
[00:18:30]  The entire thing, and he's obsessed with that.  He did it for us, and threw all our names in the rant.  Yeah.  I mean, the most vulgar man I've ever met in my life, and I could not keep a straight  face the entire time we were filming.  Which is good for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Yeah, just to be giggling and fun.  What?  Family film.  Who are you in Poseidon?  Because I saw that.  I don't really remember it as much.  I know it was a shorter movie, but you worked with Dreyfuss.  There were some cool people in the movie.  Um, I played, uh, uh, Kurt Russell's future son in the hall. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  I thought you looked familiar.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Great drowning scene he did, too.  How creepy was that?  Phenomenal.  Yeah, that was awful.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Felt like I couldn't breathe watching that.  I know.  I think I have emphysema, because, like, I swim in the pool, and I'll hold my breath for  half the pool, and I actually thought of that scene, and I'm like, oh.  Right.  I like half the pool.  I thought a lot of people said that as they were watching it, they would, they'd catch  themselves holding their breath in every underwater scene and everything, and I thought it was 
[00:19:30]  interesting.  Yeah, because it was really, it was really, it's a much better shot than the original.  Right.  Which, you know, big fat Shelly Winters being dragged out in stockings.  Any of those movies where they have to go under and through tunnels and stuff, I would just  be like, oh, I'd be dead.  I would just die.  There's no way you're going to be that, like, pumped up with adrenaline and be able to hold  your breath longer than, like, three seconds.  Okay, so you.  Movies are creepy.  You were a couple of big films.  How about yourself?  Me?  Not many movies.  In high school, I did this movie called Newport South, which was pretty bad, but I had 
[00:20:00]  a small part.  I played a football player.  I had, like, three lines, you know?  It was, like, we were talking about, uh, I had some line, like, what kind of bag was  my line?  And, uh, my favorite thing of watching the movie was, like, because I spent two and a  half weeks on set, missed school, got to hang out on the set with all these hot extra  girls and just sleep a lot.  And, uh, there's this frame, like, in the lunchroom scene, I'm in the corner, like,  giving my friend a high five.  I just like to freeze it and, like, look at that and be like, I got paid!  So, no, not in many movies. 
[00:20:30]  This is a big one for me.  How'd you get this one?  Just auditioned?  It was in the Black Donnelly.  Oh, okay.  Black Donnelly's a good show, man.  Thank you, man.  Really good show.  I've been the youngest brother, Sean Donnelly.  Yeah, okay.  What's that on?  I've not seen that.  Uh, it came and went, my friend.  Yeah, unfortunately.  It's going to be hard for you to see it.  It's going to be hard for you to see it.  It's going to be hard for you to see it by the DVD.  It's too bad, yeah.  It was right after Lucky Louie.  Oh, boy, yeah.  I know that feeling.  Yeah.  I was going to say, you can get it on DVD.  Yeah, I'm a pop culture zilch, though.  I don't know pop culture very well at all.  And I know I was reading a lot of the bios.  I know you did improv and stand-up. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I did.  I was Second City.  I came out to Los Angeles for, I'm on Carpoolers, which is on ABC.  Jerry Miner's a buddy of mine.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  And that's another situation where we had 13 episodes and the writer's strike kind of froze us up.  And that was it.  I did a lot of stand-up and improv and I auditioned for this.  When I auditioned for it, they had this really heartfelt monologue about this guy and how his father used to keep a diary in the military and all this stuff. 
[00:21:30]  And I finished and the cast director was like, that was really good.  It was also not the right sides for you to do.  So we're going to get you the right stuff.  But they wanted a sort of comedic perspective to be one of the characters.  And that's what I try and bring.  You guys are going to be recognized starting tomorrow, man.  They are.  I'll have a lot of voiceover jobs.  That's got to piss you off a little bit.  I'm looking to get an Allstate campaign.  You've got a lot of lines.  Do they recognize you, TJ? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was joking.  If this movie's huge, these people are all going to get recognized.  But I'll have to be in a bank asking for change.  And if I get the wrong change, I've got to be, oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  And then people will be like, oh, oh, that's that guy.  That's got to suck in a way.  I mean, this movie's going to be huge.  These guys are all definitely going to be recognized.  And if you don't know, we said it earlier, he's the guy behind the camera for most of the film.  Oh, that sucks.  You'll recognize his voice.  Yeah, hopefully. 
[00:22:30]  Every girl will want to sleep with you.  Just yell the line.  Just yell the line.  How creepy would that be?  Fantastic.  She's like, yo, run, run, run.  Weird.  Well, very good.  We've got to take a break here.  I'm sure you guys have got a busy day.  You've been on TV?  We've got you all over the place.  Yeah.  What's the next stop?  Press Junket, I think.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This is our first thing for today, though.  Oh, good.  You'll remember us.  The one girl who's not here.  The one who, let's just say.  She's doing CW11. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, is that the one?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was great.  She's kind of like the Ally Sheedy type of character.  Kind of like a weird, detached vibe to her.  And she was great.  She was emo.  She took a good biting.  Let's just say that.  A fine biting.  Yeah, she looks good, Bitten.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the movie's Cloverfield.  Roland, thumbs up, right?  Yeah, Roland was the one.  Look at Roland.  Roland was the one that pushed Cloverfield on us.  And I'm glad he did it.  The movie was really good.  And you guys were awesome today.  They actually used Roland's head to roll down the street. 
[00:23:30]  Roland's got a giant head.  Roland isn't a very 1990s Nirvana shirt.  Give him the thumbs up.  No, not at all.  A little thing about, you see that t-shirt?  That's all he wears in New York.  And it's winter.  The guy does not believe in a winter coat.  Doesn't matter how cold it is.  That's how he walks around.  He walks around in a t-shirt.  Yeah, he's not.  Hey, can Roland come in for one second?  Before we, before we, do we have one second?  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted, Roland, could you give the big plug for Cloverfield?  Because, you know, they all came in.  Just please.  Yeah, tell us what you liked about Cloverfield. 
[00:24:00]  It opens today at a theater near you.  Fandango.  What?  What are you talking about?  No, it was deep.  But why, Roland, why should people see Cloverfield?  What did you like about it?  It's a fun ride, scary action.  What are you, quoting the posters again?  In your own words, Roland.  Yeah.  Mine's a series?  I hate talking on the air.  It's good.  Roland in sweat. 
[00:24:30]  It's a great film.  Go to the theater.  Fandango it.  In the review, he has said Fandango more than any other word.  He's all right.  Is he getting paid by Fandango just to say, I love Fandango, Fandango.  Just Fandango it.  Go Fandango.  Fandango, Fandango to the movie.  Well, I think you guys have a really good movie, man.  I really liked it.  Thank you.  It got a real reaction out of me.  I had no idea what to expect.  Appreciate it.  And I was really pleasantly surprised.  It's going to get a tremendous amount of revenue generated, so I'm sure you guys will 
[00:25:00]  have an option to do another one.  You're expecting, like, number one, right?  Keep them crossed.  If only we could edge past Mad Money, you know.  One star, by the way, for Mad Money.  And that's more than it deserves.  It's one of those infuriating movies.  Which one?  Was it Queen Latifah?  Yeah.  Or was it the one star?  Big fat neutron star just rotating in a circle, sucking up everybody's money in good  roles.  We get it.  You're sassy.  All right.  With that, we got to go to break. 
[00:25:30]  Guys, thank you so much for stopping by.  Thank you for having us.  Thank you, ladies.  Hey, this is Michael Stahl, David.  Hey, this is Jessica Lucas.  Hey, this is Mike Vogel.  Hey, this is Odette Usman.  Hey, this is TJ Miller.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthem.  Hey.  Hey.  Ha, ha.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come here. 
[00:26:00]  Shut up, bitch.  Come, come, come.  Oh, boy.  Fight it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Suck it.  Hey.  Daddy, can I come, too?  Don't forget to swallow.  Hang over, baby bub.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing's better than a husky.  Oh, OK.  Terrific. 
[00:26:30]  Stick it in my mouth.  Yeah, suck it.  Hey.  Ha.  Come on, come on, come on.  This tastes so good.  Hey.  Hey.  Bend over, baby bub.  Hey.  Hey.  Ha.  Hey.  Ha.  Hey.  Georgia.  It's Georgia.  Don't, don't, don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hey.  Oh, stop.  You're getting me all excited.  Hey.  Hey.  That old gag. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Damn you.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Damn you.  OK.  Terrific.  Opie and Anthony.  Friends.  It's the 2002-2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Anthony, my God, why are we making them wait?  Our next guest is a very funny comedian.  Please welcome back to the program Brian Regan. 
[00:27:30]  It's a big Letterman intro.  That's how we get you on.  We get you the Letterman intro.  Oh, you want to hear it again?  Yeah.  Our next guest is a very funny comedian.  Please welcome back to the program Brian Regan.  Hey.  Hey.  Brian.  Who's that guy, though?  That voice?  I don't know.  That sounds familiar.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  How you been?  Good.  How you guys?  Very good.  Very good.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Tickets are going like crazy.  Yeah.  They're insane.  They're insane.  They're like hotcakes.  Hotcakes. 
[00:28:00]  They told me they're going like hotcakes.  Like hotcakes.  Uh-huh.  And I don't know how fast the hotcakes go.  How do you go like a hotcake?  I don't know, but hotcakes must move, man.  That must have been.  I think somebody should open up like a little hotcake stand.  You know, just out on the sidewalk, because you know you're going to do well.  Hey, how are they selling?  What do you mean how they're selling?  They're hotcakes.  Are you kidding me?  Goddamn.  I just sell them all day just like they are, like the hotcakes, and I limo my way home. 
[00:28:30]  Some idiot should just do that.  That's something you would see in Manhattan.  You know that saying, though, had to come up in a logging camp, you know, where they just  sit around with the plaid and the hats and hotcakes all day long.  Another hotcake, another stuff.  Gee, those logs are going like hotcakes.  You know how they go back at the cabin?  Yeah.  Right.  It's not like here.  It doesn't make any sense anywhere else.  Anywhere else, it's stupid, Brian. 
[00:29:00]  Selling like hotcakes.  You mean it's not going well?  I don't particularly care for hotcakes.  We've got to let Brian Regan in into our new bid here that we came up with today.  Very excited about the money snatch idea.  So much fun.  It's called the money snatch, Brian.  Yeah.  And Brian has done a lot of radio.  He probably knows what we're talking about.  You know this type of promotion where they get a bunch of money, right?  And they put it either in a bank vault or in one of those big glass tubes with the air  blowing. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Spinning about.  The lucky contestant goes into the little booth or the vault and has to pick  up as much money in whatever time period.  Usually, it's whatever the frequency of the station is.  And, you know, 102 seconds you have to get all that cash.  That's why you want to do one on the high end.  Yeah.  You're on 1.02 radio.  It's like college radio.  You have 85, you know, or something ridiculous.  88.  88.  I know it's way down there, Toby. 
[00:30:00]  Way down in the 80s.  I don't spend much time back on the college end of the radio band.  There are rules.  You can hear a reggae song and then next thing you know, you're listening to Black Sabbath.  They mix it all up.  Nice for you.  Everyone likes to say college radio is so, dude, we are cutting edge.  We're the ones playing the tunes.  They don't play on your corporate station.  Anytime I click on a college station, it is the lamest stuff ever.  I hear either one guy talking about issues he doesn't even know about. 
[00:30:30]  That's us.  That's us.  What's wrong with that?  It was odd because it was a lot further up the dial than I'm used to hearing college.  And it was on a Saturday.  Oh, it was a replay of this show.  Damn it.  So I show it.  Yeah.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe you're right.  That should be like the promo tape that you use.  Talking about stuff we don't know about.  Oh, and hey.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  Do that again.  They will make a promo out of it.  Yeah, they'll make a promo out of that.  You know, we have a new little contest based on that, though, Brian. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, well, good, man.  I'm looking forward to, is that going to be taking place next Wednesday?  Oh, next Wednesday.  Next week.  Yeah.  Yeah, you'll be gone.  You'll be in another city.  Make them believe you'd like those DJs, too.  We got some ladies coming in.  This is only for the ladies.  Only for the ladies.  Contest for the ladies.  How many now are we going with?  We're going to get seven contestants, because some of the ladies will back out.  We know that.  Okay.  And whoever shows up gets to do it, you know?  Very good.  We got three ladies set and ready to do the money snatch. 
[00:31:30]  And they have to be completely naked.  Oh.  Not a stitch of clothing, because you know how it is with the clothes.  They get the big pocket pants, so they could shove a bunch of money in the pockets.  So they got to be naked while they're getting the money.  Right.  They have to be completely naked.  That's the O&A twist.  That's the twist.  All the other stations, they give them big overalls, so they can stuff money in their overalls.  With the big call letters and station logo on the overalls.  And the big rubber fishing boots, and you're just like throwing the money down on the top. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, and the boots all in there.  Maybe sometimes with the one in the glass tube with the air blowing, they give them a big  net, and they got to net it.  They look retarded in the tube.  They look ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I'd wear one of those barrels.  Don't they have, like, those barrel outfits?  Just a barrel.  You know, with the suspenders holding the barrel up?  That was the old-time-I'm-poor look.  You know, in the old-time-like-  You're pretty poor when you're walking around with your own barrel.  You just got to wear a barrel.  You know, and it's like if I'm tired, I just bring my head down inside the barrel and I 
[00:32:30]  go to sleep.  It's like a home.  It's like my home and my outfit.  Yeah.  Yeah, like in the cartoons, that when they were poor, they'd walk around in a barrel  with some shoulder straps.  You got to have the straps to hold the barrel up.  The barrel falls.  And then your feet sticking out of the bottom.  You got little feet for your, you know, little holes for your feet to come out.  Because you're naked in there, and you can't just walk around naked.  All right.  Bravo.  Woman turtle.  Yeah.  So where are we-  I don't know if we explained that enough.  Did we explain the barrel thing enough?  No, we did.  You know, what it's about and how you fit in there and why you wear it. 
[00:33:00]  Did we cover it all?  We covered everything to do with the barrel.  We covered all angles.  So completely naked.  But there's one other twist that we've only been telling to the contestants.  To see if they're willing to do this.  On the air.  The audience can't hear me talk.  Okay.  Only the potential contestant on the phone can hear me.  And then we hear their reaction to that final twist. 
[00:33:30]  The final twist.  So Brittany is-  Let's get Brittany.  Brittany wants to do the O&A Money Snatch.  Brittany.  Brittany.  Hello.  This goes down next Wednesday.  We'll have at least $1,000 in ones all over the studio.  You run around with four of the contestants naked getting as much money as possible-  Picking up.  Yeah.  Within like five minutes or so.  As much money.  Brittany.  Yeah.  Hello.  Yes.  Would you like to-  Are you considering this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Would you like me to explain that final twist?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I know what it is, though. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Oh, really?  Wait.  Hold on, though.  I think maybe I do.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Do not repeat what it is.  Don't say what it is.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to turn Anthony's mic off, but Brittany will be able to hear Anthony.  I'm going to put some music on, and Anthony's going to explain the twist.  Okay.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  I want to know.  Hurry.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Hi.  I'm fabulous.  How are you?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  I hope they talk a lot, because I like this music.  Well, like, clean?  Yeah.  No.  No.  It's not.  No.  It's, I mean, hold on.  Like, no, I do shave, so, like, I would.  Like, it's not shaved right now, but it's, like, short.  Okay.  We have no idea what she's talking about.  What in the world? 
[00:35:00]  Don't jump out of that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is she a hairy Christian?  Um, maybe, like, three or twice a week.  Like, sometimes more, sometimes less.  No, no.  It's, it's, it's, it's, no, no, no, no.  No.  No, not at all.  Right. 
[00:35:30]  That's, yeah.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew, oh, my God, I so knew it.  Well, Anthony has explained it to Brittany.  Well, Brittany, don't tell anyone what Anthony just told you.  Okay.  Oh, my God, you did, they're so gross.  Well, Brittany, are, are, are you in?  Um.  Do you think you could do that?  Well, what time is it going to be?  Ah, see, we can't have wishy-washy.  You're wishy-washy. 
[00:36:00]  How old are you?  I'm still in school.  I can't miss school.  How old are you?  I'm from Cleveland.  I'm 17.  Oh, see, we can't have you do that because you're underage.  No, do I have to be 18?  Yeah.  No.  Okay, I'm not, I'm 18.  No, sorry, Brittany.  Yeah, we're going to hang up on Brittany.  Maybe, maybe she'll be 18 by next Wednesday.  She can't be a contestant.  I might have just committed some type of crime.  I might have committed a crime right there, and I'm not even aware of it. 
[00:36:30]  What am I, a lawyer?  I'm supposed to know these things?  Who knows?  She said she was 25 when I was typing online there.  I didn't know.  You want to go to someone else then?  Yeah, stalker Patty.  Hi, how you doing?  Oh, God.  Patty?  Yes?  Why do you want to participate in this contest?  Well, I'm not going to be able to work for the next four weeks because of my foot, and  I won't have an income, and if I don't get, like, disability, I'll have nothing.  So I guess take a little for the team and at least try to get some way of paying my rent. 
[00:37:00]  Because of your foot.  Are you a field goal kicker?  Oh, yes.  I kick from every guy.  I'm on the DL.  I don't know.  What do you think?  She had a huge, disgusting hammer toes, and we actually had her hooked up with a surgeon  that fixed her feet for free for mentions on the show, and she had one done, and she's  walking around with a cane.  This is the same girl, if you remember, we had shaved off all her hair for U2 tickets, 
[00:37:30]  so now she's walking around limping with a cane and an Auschwitz hairdo, and she looks  really awful.  I don't think I've ever seen hammer toes.  What do they...  They...  It's a big...  You know where your big toe meets your foot?  Yes.  You know how you got kind of a knuckle right there on the side of your foot?  Right.  That knuckle piece is shoved out about three inches.  It looks like a boomerang.  It's a big bone.  And then, in turn, your big toe then points toward all your other toes. 
[00:38:00]  It's a boomerang.  Like overlapping them.  Yeah.  So that toe is pointing out?  Way out.  The bone.  The bone is pointing out.  And the actual big toe is bent the other way, pointing toward all the rest of your piggies.  There it is.  It's a drawing.  You got the drawing.  Oh, my gosh.  Hence the word hammer.  That looks like the Red Wings logo.  Does it?  Yeah, that would be a shorter way to describe it.  It looks like the Red Wings logo.  All right.  So you want to explain the twist in the contest? 
[00:38:30]  Well, first I want to let Patty understand there's $1,000 laying on the floor, you and seven other girls.  And, Patty, it's complete nudity.  All right.  Well, I guess I can handle that part.  I'll get over my shyness if it means a roof over my head for a rat and stuff.  Right.  Okay.  Now, if Opie will take me off the air, I will then explain to you the twist that goes on with this contest.  And, Patty, don't be stupid.  Don't repeat after Anthony, okay?  Don't give it away. 
[00:39:00]  Of course not.  All right.  Here's the music, and Anthony is about to explain the twist to Stalker Patty.  Hello?  Hi.  No concept.  Yeah.  Why?  No.  No.  Why? 
[00:39:30]  Just once a month, if you know what I mean.  What does that mean?  All our imaginations, huh?  What?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can't do that. 
[00:40:00]  She's out.  She's out.  Oh, I guess I have to figure out a way to pay my rent.  I'm going to be in trouble for four weeks.  She's out.  Well, sorry.  Sucks to be you.  She doesn't need the money that bad.  I do need the money.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  She will not do that, Anthony.  Fabio, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You know, I'm a big Brian Regan fan, but I missed where you were playing.  Was it Carolin's or Carolin's, Brian?  What? 
[00:40:30]  Why do people get such a big...  They get weirded out on their names, you know?  Yeah.  I'm sure you say that wrong to people.  Hi, Carolin.  It's Carol-line.  My name's Carol-line.  Oh, oh, sorry.  My name's not really Brian.  It's Bryon.  Bryon's on the other side.  I don't even remember my own...  This is my name tag.  Look, it's very lengthy. 
[00:41:00]  I have to hold it up with a support wire from the top of my head to hold the length of the name tag.  And when I enter doorways, I have to come in and angle it sideways to fit the whole name tag within the door frame.  Bryon's on the other side.  Sorry, Carol-line.  Brian Regan playing Carol-lines all weekend long.  Yes, you're crazy if you missed this.  I think a bunch of us are going down to tonight's show.  That'd be great, man. 
[00:41:30]  Two shows tonight, Bryon, or one?  One tonight.  What time, eight?  I think it's eight o'clock.  Okay.  Two Friday, three Saturday, 17 on Sunday.  17 shows.  They work.  The big finale.  All right, one more try at getting a contestant for the O&A Money Stats before we take a break here.  Hillary?  Yes?  Hey.  Hi, Hillary.  Hello.  You might want to do this contest.  Possibly, yeah.  All right.  Where's she calling from, Ant?  Yeah, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Cleveland also, but I'm not 17. 
[00:42:00]  How old are you?  I'm 25, but I look 17.  You would have to road trip to New York.  We want to do this Wednesday.  Okay, yeah.  I'd have to finagle one of my finals and do it early.  Well, we don't care about your schedule, but Hillary, you do understand now, this is  the tricky part, that you will have to be completely naked for this.  I understand.  With up to seven other girls.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  And lots of dollar bills all over the studio, and you'll have like five minutes to collect 
[00:42:30]  as many as possible.  Because I think that's the part a lot of the girls would have the problem with, getting  over their shyness of being naked.  Right.  And you have no problem with that?  No.  All right.  Then there's just one other thing that I want to fill you in on, but as long as she's good  with being naked, that's pretty much the big hurdle.  Okay.  All right.  Let me fill you in on the rest.  Music time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  No.  No.  I love how long it takes to ask this question.  No, I know.  It's taking advantage of working this a little bit.  No, no.  No, there's nothing there.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Um, well, I wasn't, I was more concerned with how I was going to pick it up. 
[00:43:30]  Hmm.  Wow.  Oh.  Okay.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  I was afraid I was going to have to pick it up with those.  With those.  With those.  She's, uh, I, I.  It must be Siamese twins. 
[00:44:00]  I hope she does understand the concept.  It didn't seem to bother her.  No, not at all.  Put me back on, uh, I hope she, uh, understands.  Hold on.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, turn it up.  I, I, I, she understands completely.  Didn't seem to, uh, it doesn't have any problem with it. 
[00:44:30]  You're all right with that, Hillary.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  As long as I can pick up the money with my hands.  Works for me.  All right.  Don't give too much out there.  All right.  All right, Hillary.  Um, so you'll road trip all the way from Cleveland to do this?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  We need a guarantee.  Yeah.  I mean, I have to speak with my professor tomorrow, but.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick will talk to you.  That might be a no.  She's got to like blow off a final.  What, what, what city is she in?  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Maybe, maybe Anthony should talk to her professor. 
[00:45:00]  With the music and the whole thing.  Here's what she's got to do.  And then you can.  You see where I'm going with this professor?  Why don't we try one more?  She's a local girl.  We know she can make it because she's a calling from Long Island.  Anthony.  All right.  Allison.  Yeah.  How old are you?  31.  31, Allison.  Okay.  You understand the O&A money snatch game?  Yes.  I like the way the key questions get asked at the end.  Now, how old are you?  Oh. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  So what part of the planet are you on?  Oh, you're too far away.  All right.  Allison.  Yes.  You do understand this is complete nudity.  Mm-hmm.  You will have to be completely naked, not a stitch of clothing, not even socks.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And you have no problem with that?  Nope.  Well, and there will be about $1,000 in ones all over the studio.  Right.  And you'll have about five minutes to collect the money, okay?  Okay.  With the other girls.  And the girl that collects the most money, we should tell all the contestants, that lady  will get the rest of the money that's left in the studio. 
[00:46:00]  So wait a second.  Not even socks?  Not even socks?  Not even socks.  Are you making that clear to everybody?  I think I am now.  Okay.  Okay.  I just don't know, you know.  All right.  There is another twist, Allison.  Yeah.  Okay.  And Ann's going to explain it.  Don't give it away, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Music's on, and here goes Anthony.  Yeah.  That's a yes.  So far, so good.  No.  No.  Uh-oh.  Mm-mm. 
[00:46:30]  It's like the stock market.  It's up, it's down.  Oh, excuse me?  That's neutral.  We were not quite sure of the way the market's headed there.  Well, we'll explain further.  What kind of question is that?  What's that wind?  Is she hang gliding?  I'm very happy with it.  That's good.  Okay, that's a good answer yelling to me.  Okay? 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  So far, so good.  Okay.  Oh.  Not really.  What does not really mean?  Are you done, Ann?  Yes, I'm done.  Allison, without letting anybody in on what was just said or anything. 
[00:47:30]  Anthony has such a potty mouth.  He's turning red.  Oh, it's fun.  Come on.  I'm like shocked.  I can't touch a potty mouth.  Well, you know what?  I was being very graphic because I like getting right to the point.  Yeah, we want to make sure we're going to have some fun girls in here.  And that's why we have to turn Ann's mic off because he really explains it.  Did you say potty mouth?  Yeah.  Potty mouth or party mouth?  I have a potty mouth.  Oh, potty. 
[00:48:00]  Like it's full of duty, Brian.  Like a dirty boy.  I thought it was like a potty mouth.  We're going to have balloons and there's going to be confetti.  We're going to have the little pointed hats.  Cake.  With the cake.  You have such a potty mouth.  No, no, no.  Potty mouth.  Yeah.  So I guess that's, um, she's still shocked.  I guess that's a no.  Yeah, because that's kind of unsanitary.  Ask your professor.  Ask your professor.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  Well, we're going to have to let Allison go.  Well, thank you, Allison.  Thank you.  All right.  She's at least being honest.  We got a bunch of other girls that want in.  I liked her answer.  What do you mean by that?  Hey, Rick, I think Hillary from Cleveland's got to be out.  There's too much that could go wrong there.  So we still have three contestants.  Okay.  We got to make some tough decisions on this show.  How many total will there be?  Seven.  Seven.  Up to seven.  And we got four to go and it'll go down next Wednesday.  Can I make a guess?  Because I can't hear when Anthony's doing it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Just from what I'm, I'm guessing they have to put it in a satchel? 
[00:49:00]  A satchel.  Yes.  Yes.  They will have a satchel that is provided.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  See?  I'm just doing my best.  Actually, it could be a community pot, a satchel that's left on the side and then somehow  we'll figure out later who wins that satchel.  I see.  There's plenty of options here that it could happen.  Okay.  Right.  Hey, Eric from Boston saw Brian Regan in Boston.  His new stuff kills.  Oh, wow.  Thank you. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it should be said, it does kill.  I saw Brian up in Boston, too.  Yeah.  It was cool.  You guys were hanging up there for a couple days.  Yeah.  And we saw you.  Yeah.  And I appreciate you guys coming out, man.  I guess it was Norton's show, and then right afterwards, I went over to the Comedy Connection,  which is a great place.  I saw Brian over there.  Packed house, and they're just screaming.  It's amazing.  Well, he's playing New York City.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony, we've got to take a break.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com. 
[00:50:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jay wants to check in real fast from Philly.  What's up, Jay?  Yo, man.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Yeah.  Today, I got my first wow, and I was making one of my deliveries.  Oh, you got the wow on?  What's up?  You got the wow on your vehicle?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  Well, anyway, I was pulling up to the stuff.  I mean, I was like, this lady.  It must have been her and her two daughters and then a couple of friends or something. 
[00:50:30]  But I got all six of them lined up right in a row wowing me.  I was like, yeah, yeah, everyone all around started that.  Yeah.  Dude, I thought it was awesome.  That's great.  See, it works, right, Jay?  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  The mother and the daughters?  How great is that, Brian?  Mother-daughter combo, Brian.  Come on.  I threw it like 12 in a row, man.  12 boobage in a row with six girls.  That's what you get.  You do the math.  Yeah, I just want to thank you guys, man.  You got the greatest.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Rock on forever, fellas. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  See, it's like fishing.  That's what it is.  It's like fishing.  You put it on your car, and then you just drive around.  And before you know it, you don't even expect it.  And then, huh, huh, there's boob.  Like trolling.  Right.  You're trolling.  Trolling?  You're moving if you're trolling.  Right.  Anthony, speaking of driving, Brian drives.  I do drive.  Oh, yeah?  I do drive, yeah.  I was...  The music just stops, damn it.  Oh, my gosh.  Opie, you're awful at the segway. 
[00:51:30]  Just to make it even more dramatic, just cut the music, put them on the spot.  Brian, do you have any anecdotes about driving?  Well, I wasn't going there.  I just assumed that you drove like the rest of us.  I was driving...  That's the Opie segway.  I didn't know I had my tape recorder on when I was driving here.  That's the sound effects of me pulling up to the studio.  You got to be careful, though, you know, when you do drive.  Sure. 
[00:52:00]  That's all I wanted to say about that.  Just be careful.  Wear a seatbelt, right?  Be careful out there.  Because I know people are out there driving, and I just want to make sure that they're safe.  You know, buckle up.  You're a good guy.  You know, you got to throw like a public service announcement in every now and then, you know?  Every so often, just help out.  Mr. Safety.  And stay off drugs.  That's a good one, too.  Stay off drugs while you're driving.  That's good.  I was driving. 
[00:52:30]  I saw a truck.  This was about a month ago.  Pulling a horse trailer with a sign on the back of the horse trailer that said,  Caution Transporting Show Horses.  Oh, 10 and 2.  10 and 2.  We're sharing the road with show horses.  If I start to lose control, I'll hit one of these cars with people.  Or at least a trailer with just plain old horses, but those horses, they got to put on a show. 
[00:53:00]  What the hell's the guy thinking?  You know, I got no beef with show horses, but, you know, a spin-out is a spin-out.  You kind of hit things at random.  Whoa, I don't want to hit the trailer!  Those horses might be center ring under the big top!  God damn, Brian!  See?  There you go.  He drives.  Caroline's.  I was in...  Tonight, all this weekend.  Driving on I-5 out in California.  73-car pile-up on the same highway, like way behind us. 
[00:53:30]  You know, we heard it on the news that 73 cars, and I was...  You know, it wasn't like the car right behind, and it made me wonder,  how would you like to be the car that was the first car right in front of that,  just looking in the rearview mirror, oh, oh, man!  Did I cause that?  I ain't stopping.  No, no, I ain't stopping.  What good is stopping going to do if you cause that?  I am so sorry! 
[00:54:00]  I didn't mean for any of...  I'm sorry!  Sorry!  Sorry!  Sorry!  Pass it on!  Pass on my sorrow!  Because that'll make the guy in the back feel good, you know?  What's that?  He's sorry?  Okay, good.  Good.  Because this is a nightmare.  But you're saying...  You're saying he is sorry.  Okay, good.  That makes it a little bit better.  And so, you know, some police guy, you know, had to be the first guy on the scene. 
[00:54:30]  I wonder what his first...  You know, he probably, like, just saw the 73-car crack-up,  and, like, you know, he had to talk into his little shoulder mic.  I'm going to need more yellow police tape.  Yeah, I need a backup on yellow police tape.  And if you think you know how much I need, I need more than that.  Like, if you think, oh, he might need a box,  I need all the yellow police tape that you can get your hands on. 
[00:55:00]  Over.  What kind of police report would you write for that, you know?  Okay, one car smashed into another car.  And then another car smashed into that.  And then another car smashed into that.  And then another car smashed into that.  And then another car smashed into that.  And then another car...  How do you spell smashed?  Anybody?  Can anybody help me out here?  Smashed.  Brian ringing at Caroline's all weekend. 
[00:55:30]  That is killing me.  All weekend long.  You had asked about driving, right?  Yeah.  Something about that.  It just felt like bringing it up for you.  But, Brian, we were just asking if you drove.  Oh!  Yes, yes, I drove over.  Not everything has to be a joke.  Finally get an answer to a question out of the guy.  I just wanted to know how you got to the studio, Brian.  Right.  I didn't need you to go off on a tangent about fog and crash-ups. 
[00:56:00]  You were going to, if you said no, get you a car to take you down to Caroline.  That's the question we wanted.  Now there's not time.  Now you're walking.  Now you've got to walk.  Cancel the car, Anthony.  That's all we need to know.  Mr. Joke Man over there.  Imagine.  Hey, can we get you something to drink?  Hey, you know these beverages in the supermarket?  What is with the advertising on them?  Brian, Brian, do you want a glass of water, man? 
[00:56:30]  That's all we're going with this.  The juice aisle.  Cranapple.  Yeah.  Just asking.  It's a simple question.  Cranberry juice.  Cranberry.  Cranapple.  Let's throw out punchlines to Brian Rady.  There you go.  Why not?  That's all right.  All right.  Disturb, Brian Rady.  Don't you love Disturb, Brian?  I thought that was Nat King Cole.  This guy's Israeli there, old dirty. 
[00:57:00]  The singer of this band is Israeli.  You just picture this blaring from tanks.  You know?  Scaring the crap out of everybody.  He was in the army when he was like six years old.  He got a late start over there.  They put him in the tanks at like 12 over there, I think.  Does Brian like the Disturb or what?  Sure, I love it, man.  And a rock.  I'm going to go get the CD.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  No, it's good.  I like it.  What do you rock out to, Brian? 
[00:57:30]  Pink Floyd.  Oh.  All right.  Okay.  Good, good.  Very good.  You picked a classic band that's still relevant.  A very safe band.  That's a safe band.  Let's ask him what else he listens to.  All right.  What else?  Well, they have a few CDs.  No, no, no, no.  You okay with Pink Floyd?  Give us another one.  I have, I've got like 10 Pink Floyd CDs.  Oh.  And I rotate amongst them.  That's it.  That's all you need.  That's all you listen to is Pink Floyd.  Sometimes I listen to the Division Bell, and sometimes I'm listening to Dark Side of the 
[00:58:00]  Moon.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it depends on my mood.  Right.  How about one more band you listen to, Brian?  Any other band.  Any other band.  Well, before they became Pink Floyd, their name was, um, no.  No other bands, though?  Any new bands?  Have you guys heard of the Beatles?  A little combo out of Liverpool, I believe.  That's right.  That's right.  I don't think they're still performing, but they had some great stuff.  Yeah.  They had some really good stuff.  I hope they don't sell out like all my favorite bands do. 
[00:58:30]  I hope they keep it real, playing at those small clubs in Liverpool.  The Cavern.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's, uh, tonight.  And, you know, Andy's got to leave soon.  I know.  He's going to be, uh, driving over to Caroline's.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm getting in my car and driving.  Just a few blocks.  Maybe I'll hitchhike.  You know, I, I, have you, you know when the hitchhikers, they hold the signs up?  Sure.  You know, they got to, like, give you an idea of, uh, you know, where they're headed.  Even though they're already on, hopefully, the correct side of the road. 
[00:59:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  You know, it's like, if you're going to stop, you're, you're going that way, right?  And sometimes, I, I saw a guy holding up a sign.  This was like in New Jersey.  He's holding up a sign.  What is it?  Like, I-80?  That head, it said Chicago.  And he, he's walking backwards on the highway.  You know, I guess, like, until he gets picked up, he's going to make some headway.  You know what I mean?  I want to get to Chicago.  And, um, you know, in case someone doesn't pick me up, I'm going to walk backwards to 
[00:59:30]  the city, to the city of Chicago.  Or, or at least I'll get on my way, you know?  Maybe I can get one 247 billionth of the way to Chicago.  While I wait.  And then somebody can pick me up and take me to rest of the way.  Would you stand still, buddy?  You ain't getting any closer to Chicago.  He's walking backwards.  Oh, God damn.  And he's signed, you know?  I mean, sometimes I don't even know what they're, you know, they're trying to entice you. 
[01:00:00]  I'm driving.  I see a guy holding up a sign, a hitchhiker.  It says, I will stab you and stuff you in a hefty bag.  And I'm like, you ever get, like, a gut feeling about somebody?  You know, like, you can't put your finger on it?  I'm like, ah, I don't know.  I don't, I don't know about this guy.  And so I didn't, I didn't pick him up.  I don't know why.  I just didn't.  And, um.  I drive, I drive about a half, you know, about another half of my, I see another hitchhiker.  He's holding a sign that says, there's no telling what I'll do. 
[01:00:30]  So I'm like, hey, hop in, you know, the guy might buy me a sandwich.  There's no, there's no telling, there's no telling what, you know.  Yeah, sure.  You're the best, man.  No telling.  No telling, Brian.  Brian Reagan.  Darren, what's up?  Brian, you are hilarious.  Hey, thank you, man.  I've been listening to you for a long time.  You're definitely my favorite.  Man, I appreciate it.  When's your new album coming out?  Are you checking right now? 
[01:01:00]  What's that?  When's your new album coming out?  I don't have any short-term plans.  Why is that?  Some comics, man, they get those albums out.  Brian Reagan had an album out.  I've got one out.  Yeah.  I know, I've got it.  I've listened to it too much.  Let me tell you something.  I've got an LP.  I've got an LP out.  The LP, some of the vinyl.  Put it on your record player.  You got a hi-fi at home?  Yeah, you put it on the hi-fi.  If it's not sounding good, you might have to change the stylus. 
[01:01:30]  The stylus on there.  Put a penny on the top of the arm.  Brian does have a CD out.  It's hilarious.  I had to order the damn thing.  Most of the record stores don't carry it.  It's a shame.  Yeah, it's a special order.  Yet, you go into any record store, there's 20 Dice CDs.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, he's good.  He's good.  What?  Where?  What?  Thanks.  I appreciate it, Darren.  Ken from Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering, after the softball game, are you all going to go out for snow cones? 
[01:02:00]  You guys suck.  I don't know, huh?  Well, let's ask Brian about that.  And I enjoy snow cones after we play softball and stuff.  Well, I used to play Little League.  We used to get a free snow cone at the end of the game.  Yeah?  Yeah, you'd just be standing out in right field, you know, and it'd be like 95 degrees.  You're sweltering.  You're just out there going, oh, it's hot.  It's hot.  Going to get a free snow cone.  Free snow cone at the end of the game. 
[01:02:30]  Going to get a free one.  At the end of the game, they'd give everybody a free snow cone.  Go stand in line at the concession stand.  Can I help you?  We got a free snow cone.  I was a participant in the game, and we're supposed to get a free snow cone.  Even if you only play half game, you still get a whole snow cone.  So everybody who plays gets a snow cone, and if you play a half game, you don't get a half snow cone.  You get the whole snow cone. 
[01:03:00]  So it's either half game, whole snow cone, or whole game, whole snow cone.  That's how I remember that.  That's how I remember that.  It's always a whole snow cone.  Brian, how many outs?  Grape.  I'm going to get grape or cherry, because both of them are my favorites, but grape is a little bit more of a favorite.  So if they have both, I would get grape, but if they say, we don't have grape, I say, give me cherry. 
[01:03:30]  That's my favorite, too.  It's just not my most favorite.  But it is my favorite, not the most favorite.  Or rainbow.  I'll get, if they don't have grape and cherry, I'll get rainbow.  All right, shut up, Boulder. 
[01:04:00]  It's about Brian Regan right now.  John, what's up?  Hey, John.  Yo, guys, what's up?  What's up?  We're hanging with Brian Regan, but he's got to get out of here in a few minutes.  Yeah, Brian, yesterday, last night I was feeling a little bit hungry, so I went to the cabin and got some Fig Newtons.  You'd eat just one or two.  What's the whole deal with that?  I know.  Isn't that amazing?  Because it's...  Your listeners are like the coolest.  They do the setups.  Well, you probably looked at the Fig Newtons box. 
[01:04:30]  They've got the serving sizes.  They have the serving size on there.  Yeah.  And it says, serving size, two cookies.  Two cookies.  Who the hell eats two cookies?  I eat Fig Newtons by the sleeve.  Two sleeves is a serving size.  I open them both and eat them like a tree chipper.  Fig Newton shavings coming off the side.  And then I put a Newton catcher and I emptied a bag out as a snack.  What the hell are they talking about, two Fig Newtons? 
[01:05:00]  They're the size of a postage stamp.  You want another one?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I've already had two whole entire Fig Newtons.  Maybe I could try to muscle one more now.  But I don't know.  I'm stuffed to the rafters.  They're nuts.  We got an ER here.  We got a three Fig Newton eater.  They're pounding on his chest.  How many did he have?  Doesn't he read?  You got to read, man.  You got to read the food labels. 
[01:05:30]  Sure.  That's the whole point of them.  They're there for your reading pleasure.  Thank God Brian's here for our listeners.  They have questions like that and I wouldn't have known what to tell that guy.  It was weird that he had mentioned the Fig Newtons because I knew a little bit about it.  You knew a little bit about what was written on the box and everything.  How they handle that in the emergency rooms.  All kinds of info you got.  I'm like a freak that I happen to know something about Fig Newton.  Thank God.  He's good at the improv, man.  Yeah.  You just come up with something and he's got something. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I mean, something will pop into my head.  I'll be on stage.  I'll take a sip of water and go, hey, Fig Newtons.  Let me talk about that right now.  Dookie.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, we'll just talk about Fig Newtons.  I'm getting a little hungry.  Yeah.  I'm wondering if I can get a couple donuts maybe, Brian.  Something like that maybe.  Well, you know what?  I don't know how many I want or how many I have left.  That's the thing, Dookie.  If you go into the donut places, you got to be careful.  I feel bad for the donut ladies in these places because people can't make up their mind. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know what it is about buying donuts, but people freak out.  They go in there, okay, okay, all right, I want a dozen donuts and, oh, wow, you have  a lot of donuts.  Okay, I'm going to start with four chocolate.  I want two twisty goose.  I want a lemon twirler.  I want one honey puff.  No, two raspberry twirl.  No, I want two chocolate.  No, one.  Put them back.  Put them back. 
[01:07:00]  I want a Bavarian apple crunch.  Get the ladder.  Hey, why don't you go out and think it over, huh, buddy?  It's donut day.  You can't blow donut day.  It's a big decision.  Hey, man, how often does donut day come around?  And when it does, man, you got to concentrate.  You got to be on your game.  You got to be on your game or you get the wrong, you don't, you don't go in there and 
[01:07:30]  say assorted.  No.  Then you don't know what you're getting.  Then it's up to them.  Then it's up to them.  What do they care?  They don't care about you and your life.  Right.  And your donut eating.  She's going to give you the easy donuts.  Yeah, she's going to, whatever's closest to her.  All the easy ones.  Whatever's closest to her flabby arm.  The ones that don't sell well.  Flabby powder sugar coated arm.  Wait, I shouldn't be slamming their arms.  They have nice arms.  Look at you.  It's got to be nice.  The donut ladies.  I was ready to jump on you about how, why are you so mean to donut ladies?  No, it's a composite.  It's not the actual donut ladies. 
[01:08:00]  They have nice upper arms.  From doling out all those donuts.  Yeah, that's right.  It's like a workout.  I know Brian's got to leave, but Joe has a problem here.  Joe?  Yeah, guys, listen, I'm really late for work.  I just woke up.  Do I have enough time for a Pop-Tart?  Later.  He must be calling from the other side of the world because he's concerned about breakfast.  Yeah, well, we're syndicated.  Oh, I see.  This is breakfast time for him.  Maybe he's third shift. 
[01:08:30]  Pop-Tarts, man.  You ever look at a Pop-Tarts box?  Directions.  They have directions on there for you.  Can there be a simpler food item than Pop-Tarts?  At what point can you make assumptions that people would understand something?  They have two sets of directions.  They have toaster directions, which, believe it or not, it's more than one step.  At the most, I can think of one step.  I think it would be step one, toast the Pop-Tarts. 
[01:09:00]  Go ahead, toast them.  Hey, are you still reading this?  But I swear, you look at the box, and they're, like, breaking into smaller increments.  These are some of the actual steps, and I would love to be in the room watching somebody who has to consult these steps.  Number one, remove pastry from pouch.  Oh, okay.  Let me get them out of that pouch.  Okay, I see where they're going with this.  Okay, all right. 
[01:09:30]  We're banging on all cylinders now.  Okay, number two, insert pastry.  Okay, noted.  Vertically.  Oh, oh.  The brain explodes.  They're reading toaster directions.  You're going to throw the vertical concept at them?  Yeah, vertically.  That's a good thing to jot down for your Pop-Tart box readers.  They should insert them vertically into their toaster devices. 
[01:10:00]  Difficult.  Yeah.  All right.  I hope that helps you, caller.  That probably helped out a lot.  Oh, he does?  Thank God you're here.  He doesn't have time to explain plurals.  That's like six minutes.  Yeah, come on.  I understand, Brian.  Where are you guys going?  I'm trying to help you out.  Yeah, you're right.  I can't explain plurals.  They're too complicated.  Plurals takes time.  That's a little too involved. 
[01:10:30]  I understand.  That's why we're not going there.  This guy wants to send a birthday present.  What?  Well, let's just see.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Brian, I enjoy your comedic styling.  Thank you, Joe.  And you are wise beyond your years.  Can I have a little counsel on something?  Yes.  I'm thinking of sending my friend a package via UPS.  Do you maybe have any experience in this field?  Well, you know, actually, recently I called UPS. 
[01:11:00]  I'm going to tell you this.  Be careful when you call them because you need information ready about your boxes before you even call them.  Oh, really?  Do tell.  Well, they're a good service, but you have to have the information ready to go.  You know, I called them up and I was like, yeah, I've got 10 boxes if you can come pick them up.  We need to know the weight and the girth.  All right.  Well, I don't know what the weight is and I don't know what girth means.  Now, what's the procedure?  So, he talks to me like I'm four years old. 
[01:11:30]  Well, do you have a bathroom scale?  Yeah, but if I put the box on a scale, it's going to cover up the numbers.  What do you take them off really quick and then try to look?  Ah, zero.  I'm not fast enough.  I hope that we'll get you on your way.  Probably helped him out.  I hope so.  Oh, Brian doesn't have time to help you with your science project, Justin.  He's got shows to do at Caroline's tonight. 
[01:12:00]  Very busy.  He's got to meet with friends.  Yeah, I don't know anything about that.  I don't know anything about that.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I don't know anything about science projects.  And, yes, Brian has watched golf on TV.  He'll tell you all about it tonight at Caroline's.  That stuff is hilarious, by the way, bro.  Thanks, man.  We love Brian Regan.  Yes.  He's in here all the time.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Tickets always sell out when Brian comes to town.  So you should try to reserve him right now.  The number is 2-1-2, 7-5-7, 4-100.  There's an 8 o'clock show tonight. 
[01:12:30]  And then, I don't know, he's playing like twice tomorrow, three times Saturday, like five times Sunday.  Yeah, five or seven or one show Sunday, something like that.  He sleeps there.  Greg kicks him.  He goes, get up on the stage another time.  No, the cot.  I have a cot on stage.  A cot?  Yeah, sleeping on the cot.  And then you roll out.  Hey, everybody.  Well, you killed, bro.  Let's thank you.  Hey, guys.  Yes, Brian.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for coming in again.  Thank you guys very much. 
[01:13:00]  Thank your listeners, man.  They're cool.  They're great.  They're wise beyond their years to throw the compliment back.  A bunch of wise asses.  We like that.  Love the guy.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  But right now, Storka Patty has arrived.  She's got a bit of a problem.  To the studio.  Yeah, bring her in here, Am.  Hey, boy!  Oh, God.  And it looks like she's on the verge of crying in.  Yes, on the verge of tears, so I hear.  She has written a note on paper that I think the Iranian hostages had more to write on.  It looked better.  Look at these scraps of paper she wrote this little note on.  Yay! 
[01:14:00]  Look at your hair.  Wow, it's really growing in.  You're getting quite a little mullet going there for yourself.  Oh, it's going to get longer.  Don't worry.  Yeah, well, I'm not worried.  I really don't care.  I don't like the mullet look.  No.  Stop it, Joe Dirt.  That's wonderful, Pieri.  Well, now, let's review for some of the listeners.  Yeah, we're doing the O&A Money Snatch Game Wednesday.  Right.  The Money Snatch Game involves nude women coming in here.  Studio filled with dollar bills.  Filled with cash. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, a few fives, a few tens thrown in the mix.  You never know.  But in general, a lot of ones.  On the ceiling.  At least $1,000.  On the rug.  Girls will be gathering up this money.  And the girl that gathers the most gets to keep what's left on the floor.  Correct.  All the girls that grab money are able to keep whatever they can carry.  That's how the game works.  Stalker Patty, always in financial straits, always destitute, has expressed an interest 
[01:15:00]  to join the game to get a little money.  At this point, we're not even sure we want her to do the game with the other hot ladies.  We have left it up to the listeners.  Yeah, there's a poll that is being done on foundrymusic.com right now.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  You vote if Patty should do this or not.  You don't speak until you're spoken to, Patty, please.  As a foundling over there in the corner.  Right.  Now, the latest development, Patty has written a little note. 
[01:15:30]  She's written a note on three tiny pieces of paper, both sides, in her normal, insane  writing that she writes.  Patty, I know you've expressed possibly not having this read on the air.  Please don't.  But you know that isn't possible.  Oh, please.  No.  No.  We have to read it on the air.  Yeah, because the wrong people will hear it.  They'll be calling up at home and I'll get in trouble.  Well, when the wrong people hear it, we will then address those people. 
[01:16:00]  And everything will be fine and dandy.  Don't you sweat it.  Yeah, you can't just hand Anthony notes like this.  This isn't.  And tell us we can't read it on the air.  How dare they tell you anything?  You're an adult.  I just read this, Patty.  And we're not going to be saying anything in this letter that puts you in any danger  of losing your house or anything or where you live.  Okay.  We'll lose the house like some kind of a crazy person.  Now, what seems to me a little troubling, Patty, is that there are people now in your  lives, in your life, in your lives, ceilings, people in your ceilings, there are people. 
[01:16:30]  We can't figure out plurals today.  Involved in your limiteds that are kind of telling you what you can and can't do and using  that, a threat, of kicking you out of the house to make you do or not do certain things.  Am I right here?  Thank you.  Yes, that's Cy.  Let me read the letter. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  We need some music here.  Some new music, Anthony.  Are you going to read it as Patty?  This is from the retard tape.  This is the music playing when the one guy is fondling the other guy in the bathroom.  In the men's room.  Oh, yeah.  That video is up on foundrymusic.com.  It's hilarious.  And the mom walking in on her son, Jack, in it will be on soon, too.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hi, guys.  I have a complication that came up over the weekend that could put me between a rock and 
[01:17:30]  a good place.  It seems some people were listening to the show on Thursday and Friday and took it upon  themselves to notify the people at home what I intended to try to do on Wednesday.  I was then told that if I did this thing, I'd have to move out.  The things that seemed offensive to them was the nude part of the contest. 
[01:18:00]  And then in quotes, it says, 46-year-olds don't behave this way.  So I guess that is something they told you, Patty, yes or no?  Well, yeah.  Yes.  Now, the people at home don't normally hear the show, but people they know do.  I was referred to as a tramp, et cetera, by these killers.  I'm in a dilemma, as I need the money, yet I have nothing to move with and do need the 
[01:18:30]  roof over my head, too.  Do I give up on a chance to win some much-needed money?  Or do I lose my shelter as a result?  Or do I take the box that Carol Merrill is standing by and perhaps get zonked with an ox?  I have to choose the roof over my head, because with my foot condition, I'm in no physical condition  to deal with a housing issue.  Patty, Patty, come right down here. 
[01:19:00]  I'm giving you a choice to win some much-needed money, but it may result in losing your shelter.  Patty, let's make a deal.  You could get money, perhaps enough money to move.  Or you won't get the money, yet you will still lose where you live.  Interesting, interesting little laundry.  Do you have a paperclip in your purse?  A paperclip for a dollar? 
[01:19:30]  Anyone?  A rubber band.  Two dollars for a rubber band.  The woman dressed as a...  I was going to say the C word.  Do you have a cane in an unused box?  Patty, I'll give you this $20 bill to show me an intact hymen.  An intact...  She gets $20!  You are a mess.  Let me read.  $50 for a thorax and chiclet-like teeth. 
[01:20:00]  Patty, that's a wonderful costume.  Everyone comes dressed here.  She's dressed as an army ant.  Look at her.  What?  No costume?  You didn't come...  Oh, sorry.  It was a costume.  I had one hanging up at home.  Right.  A Superman costume.  A Superman...  Wow.  Ah.  Do you have a Superman costume?  Look at this house loaded with nothing.  It's Patty's house.  She'll have a chance to win if the price is right, Patty. 
[01:20:30]  You, uh...  You're part of our showcase deal today.  All you have to do is participate in the contest.  And they will show you the door.  Is that true?  It seems that you might lose your house.  But where are you going to put this wonderful furniture?  Woo!  Yes!  Wonderful.  Castro Convertible.  Changes into a bed on the streets. 
[01:21:00]  Look at this.  Ah, hoo-ha!  Totally empty.  Nothing in there.  Patty.  I guess I'll read the rest of your letter.  She's in a dilemma.  She has to choose.  I'm in no physical condition.  Oh, wait.  Let me get your music back.  Oh, thank you.  Okay, sorry.  When I'm doing better and can eventually find another place to live on my own in a real apartment situation, 
[01:21:30]  then it won't matter what I do in my outside activities.  But right now, while other people are monitoring me, for whatever reason, I need to be careful.  I guess I cannot do the keen test.  I need the money, but I also need a roof over my head and do not have the means to find another place to live.  What to do?  What to do?  Help, Patty.  And then she has an afterthought. 
[01:22:00]  This is a clever one, Patty.  Uh-oh.  Jerry Springer.  It probably wouldn't have been possible if my identity...  Oh, it probably would have been possible if my identity didn't have to come out, like, perhaps during the contest under a different name.  So no one who knows my landlord will know it's me.  What?  Under someone else's name.  So no one who knows my landlord will know it's me.  Then I might not be in trouble. 
[01:22:30]  Hi!  I'm Penelope.  Well, you gave it away.  I'm a 14-year-old, a 45-year-old virgin.  You stalk a Penelope.  Would you change your voice, too, Patty?  Yeah.  That's impossible.  How would you change it?  Go ahead.  Go a little higher.  Look how she does that thing with her neck.  That's impossible.  It looks like she's being electric-shocked.  All her veins fall down.  So, Patty, are you going to do it or not? 
[01:23:00]  Come on.  Patty, first of all, why are people monitoring your goddamn life?  Yeah.  Who has been put in charge of you?  Myself.  But the problem is if you live somewhere, people are going to get embarrassed and they're going to think it's a reason.  No.  You pay rent?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, see?  And they should be embarrassed that you're there to begin with.  Right.  You pay rent.  You live somewhere.  You're not living in a home, are you?  Do you live in a home?  No.  Is it a home?  That, like, they monitor what you do? 
[01:23:30]  And did you sign a lease that says it has a morality clause in it?  There was no lease.  It was a friend.  I'd have been thrown out of the Playboy Mansion for some of my antics.  Yet I don't live my life with other people telling me what the hell to do.  I mean, yeah, you are a gimp and an ass, but you're an adult.  Right.  You're an adult, free to do whatever you want.  And I think there is a problem with living somewhere and having people tell you you will be thrown out for doing stuff that you want to do and you are free to do as an adult. 
[01:24:00]  I bet you there's people from the housing authority that would not allow that to happen.  It probably is illegal.  Illegal.  No, no, no, please.  Look at her flapping her arm.  Look at her flapping her little wing.  Why are you going to be in trouble?  Trouble for what?  Because people heard the show and they hear it and they call it.  Shh, Landry will hear you.  What are you worried about these people?  Why are you breathing heavy now?  You're all freaked out, Patty.  Because he just said things like the wrong things. 
[01:24:30]  Like the housing authority?  Yeah, I just got into trouble.  I'm going to go home and I'm going to be really...  Oh, will you stop, you spineless weirdo.  What are they going to do?  They can't just throw you out.  It's illegal.  I wish some of these people would actually call in who called the house.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  They're listening.  Exactly.  Why are people in charge of your life, Patty?  Yeah.  So what?  You have hair like Edith Bunker.  That's no reason to boot you out. 
[01:25:00]  Who are your real pals?  Who are your real pals?  We're all friends.  Who are your real pals that do things for you and get your stuff?  Who gave you new feet?  Who gave you new feet?  Yeah.  You two.  Right.  Who got rid of your awful hair?  Right.  Who got rid of your nipple hair?  Right.  Who waxed you?  Well, who sent you to be waxed?  Exactly.  Who gave you sort of a little social life now that you go out to these events, right?  Who gave you U2 tickets?  Who gave you U2 tickets?  Twice.  You did.  Twice.  Yeah.  Who put a sweater on that little rhesus monkey body? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Who got Ron Jeremy to do what he did to you?  Right.  Who got a man to actually touch you in a certain way the first time ever?  And who was the very first man to ever touch your bosoms?  Oh, my God.  That's right.  It was me.  That was the...  Hollywood superstar Jim Norton.  That's right.  Spider-Man star Jim Norton.  Spider-Man sidekick.  Right.  Jim Norton was your first.  I forgot all about that.  Surly truck driver.  Yeah.  STD.  STD.  That guy was right.  So, Patty. 
[01:26:00]  It's illegal for them to kick you out.  Of course it is.  You cannot be thrown out for what you do in your life.  Housing authority.  Housing authority.  I said it twice, stupid.  And if they try to throw you out, if they try to throw you out, I swear to God, we will  focus all the resources of this program and the people that listen to making their life  a living hell.  But they're very nice people.  I don't think.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  They're not.  They're not nice people.  They're trying to keep you from humiliating yourself.  They're telling you. 
[01:26:30]  It was very nice to help me out when I needed a place to put you there.  They give you a room in exchange for cash.  Period.  That is where the obligation ends.  Exactly.  You are allowed to live your life as an adult woman, not based on someone else's effing morality.  You pay them rent.  That's all you do.  And how come they call her a tramp?  She's never had anything in there.  I know.  She's a bird.  She's a prude, if anything.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hi, Angel.  Listen.  She rents a room.  She's got no rights whatsoever. 
[01:27:00]  They can toss her out on her wrinkled ass whenever they want.  I bet you're wrong, dude.  I bet you're wrong.  No, dude.  I'm telling you.  I'm not wrong.  She rents a room.  It's not even a lease.  It's not a month-to-month.  They literally have to give her a week, and they can throw her out.  She has to live by their rules.  It's only a room.  She's got no rights.  Believe me.  But don't, like, people who are, like, really thin-lipped and retarded have special rights?  Well, the handicap issue is one thing, but then they'll just put her in a mental institution.  Tom.  Tom.  No.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  No.  Even though there's no lease, there are certain laws that are in place where there is a time that they can take to throw you out.  They can't just throw you out.  All right, dude.  And even though there's no lease, it can be proven by paying rent and showing a record of paying rent that you have been there.  There are certain laws that are in place.  Yeah, but the only thing she's got on her side is that she's retarded, and that's the only thing that might help her is because she's mentally ill.  All right, Tom.  All right, later.  Look, the only thing that I could see from the point of view is that you're under someone's roof. 
[01:28:00]  No, it's not like a parent.  No.  No.  Parents can do that.  They can say, as long as you live under my roof.  They're using scare tactics.  Right.  And they're getting to you.  And how are you going to pay this rent if you don't do this?  Because you're a little fraidy cat.  How are you going to pay the rent there, Patty?  How do you pay the rent?  Have you been to work with your gimpy feet?  Either way, you're screwed.  One day a week now because I can't technically do the work that I'm supposed to do.  So you don't have to make enough to pay the rent anyway? 
[01:28:30]  No.  So either way, you're screwed.  Unless my disability comes through, which I don't know if I'm going to get.  You are a goddamn nomad.  Because I only applied for it, but it doesn't mean I'm getting it.  How much is rent?  Oh, it's $100 a month.  $25 a week.  Look at this crap hole.  Last week I worked four and a half hours.  Shut up.  Ed's doing a bit.  Lifestyles of the poor and destitute.  Look at this hobble. 
[01:29:00]  This one, the home of Patty.  She pays a whopping $25 a week.  Wonderful.  I've buried cats in shoeboxes that are bigger.  Fantastic.  How does she come up with this money on a gimped foot?  We don't know.  Where does she work these days?  Oh, what?  Where am I?  You've heard it here, folks. 
[01:29:30]  Spoken eloquently.  Her room is a full five foot by seven foot.  Wonderful.  Look at the deck out back.  Oh, wait.  Now, that's just a two by four.  Someone left out there.  I thought it was a deck.  She vacations on the beaches of Staten Island.  Patty, either way, you're screwed.  You're a mess. 
[01:30:00]  And you're going to be kicked out.  So you might as well have fun.  Do you realize in a few minutes, in 10 minutes, you make $250.  That's 10 weeks rent.  And that dive.  The nerve of those people.  Oh, please don't say that.  The wrong people will be hearing.  The wrong people.  The cousin Ostra.  Who's the wrong people?  The mafia.  I don't think the mafia owns that place.  The wrong people.  Mafia for hire.  Does it really matter who's shot and from where?  It's window dressing.  Keeps the public guessing.  The wrong people here. 
[01:30:30]  What people?  How did people know unless she got a phone call?  Because they didn't say anything.  And she told me they called the rock.  It's that son of a bitch, Paulie.  I want him dead.  Have a little brandy.  You sweat it out.  A little brandy.  You sweat it out.  You okay?  You all right?  I don't want to see him no more.  I don't want to see him no more.  Make that first on your list.  That son of a bitch is a rat.  Yeah.  Leave the foundling.  Take the cannoli.  The wrong people might hear.  Hello, Patty. 
[01:31:00]  Are people following you, Patty?  Well, people here, and they know I live dead, and they're calling the house, and it's embarrassing to the people.  Patty, that's all we had.  Should we get these people on the phone?  No.  Patty, we'll smooth things over.  Don't insult me, Patty.  Just tell me.  It was Bazzini that wanted you in that contest.  Who?  Who approached you?  Who approached you?  Tell you about Bazzini.  What do you think we're going to do? 
[01:31:30]  Make Patty a widow?  What do you think?  We're going to hold up that landlord for their $25 a week rent?  No, you're out of the mullet business.  That's your punishment.  Get out of my sight.  You know, and even if I was given a week to move, where would I go?  You can't be given a week.  There's got to be a refrigerator in the Staten Island dump.  It's bigger and probably cleaner than where you live now.  It's a dump.  It's Staten Island.  I believe they legally have to give you three months to kick you out. 
[01:32:00]  And can't you just go to the mattresses?  Go to the mattresses.  It's not like it's the first time.  Teach you how to make sauce.  Yeah.  It's been about 10 years.  Some sugar.  A little wine.  And me balls.  That you put in your sausage.  Sausage.  Sausage.  Big fat hands he had.  If I don't see you soon, Patty, I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  Patty, we need an answer.  You want to do the contest?  I want to, but I don't think I'm allowed to. 
[01:32:30]  Allowed.  You're a grown-up.  You've spent your entire life letting other people dictate what you do.  I want to.  I really want to.  You let other people dictate what you do.  You let the church F up your whole sexual prime by sitting there and putting guilt on your head.  And now you're letting other people dictate what you do.  What's wrong with you?  You're not crazy.  You should be bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.  We're not talking about your wife. 
[01:33:00]  We're talking about your life.  Yeah.  Show some balls, Patty.  Okay.  Weddle.  You don't come into this studio and talk to Opie and Anthony that way.  That's right.  Tom, you were a foundling.  You thought to him.  Hey, the dad doesn't kick your tongue out.  Draw $25 worth of chips.  Patty, you hear what these guys are saying?  $25.  Yeah.  Do you hear what they're saying to you?  Play on the house.  Right?  Yeah.  You hear what they're saying, right? 
[01:33:30]  They care about you.  Come on.  I know.  Yeah.  Who are your real pals?  The foundlings don't even have that kind of muscle anymore.  You think you can come to our contest because you're being booted out of the foundling house?  I suck.  Good enough, though.  Come on, Patty.  Show some balls.  Yeah.  God Almighty for once.  They don't kick you out.  I kick you out.  Show some hookspot.  You slap the virgin gimp around.  Okay.  She was talking to cocktail waitresses two at a time. 
[01:34:00]  Players were vomiting at the table.  Patty, you're going to do it or are you going to?  I'm going to do the contest.  There you go.  All right.  You know.  She is going to F up her life.  Yes.  Again.  I love it.  Yeah.  Have her bags on the lawn when she gets back, this tramp.  $25 a week.  That's your rent.  That's your rent.  Yeah.  I only worked four and a half hours last week. 
[01:34:30]  Here's your week's rent.  There you go.  There's a week's rent by Jimmy Norton.  Here's your week's rent.  I guess those royalties from Spider-Man rolling kind of quick.  Rolling in.  Rolling in.  $114 million.  Easy go.  Put in your pocket.  A little sum for you.  Me a bag of shells.  There's more where that came from if you do the contest.  Easy come, easy go.  I had it and I went with it.  Week's worth of rent right there.  Yeah.  I want a motorboat with tree propellers.  What a man makes his living is no difference to me, you understand. 
[01:35:00]  You know.  It's just that your business is a little risky.  I mean, the people I am with, I've known for many years and they've known me for many  years.  You know.  And it's these people that are.  I appreciate that I was given the space to live.  I mean, I was almost in a shelter in September.  You were in a shelter.  Remember when your panties got stolen off the doorknob?  Well, that was a hotel.  Well, that was a welfare hotel.  Yes.  Or you had to share the bathroom in the hall.  You had to share the bathroom and Patty went to take a shower and left her panties 
[01:35:30]  on the doorknob.  Yeah, I couldn't find them and I was wondering what happened to them.  How desperate do you have to beat a steel stalker Patty?  Patty's panties.  Underpants.  They're probably being used to like wash and whack a car.  I mean, I don't think it's going to hurt anybody.  Look at this palatial welfare hotel.  It might be in a conference where it's going to hurt anybody.  Where Patty showers and leaves her panties out on the doorknob to be stolen by a crack addict.  Look at the dripping water in this bathtub, leaving a green stain right down to the drain. 
[01:36:00]  This room originally used for storage.  But now it's Patty's palatial hotel room, courtesy New York State Welfare Department.  You are wonderful, Patty, and you're going to do the contest.  Tell those people, you know what you've got to do?  Have a little bit of a spine.  Tell the people, look, I'm a grown woman, hear me, and I know too much to go back and pretend. 
[01:36:30]  Just give them hell.  Sing some hell and ready.  And tell them you're doing what the hell you want to do.  After you know hell and ready.  But I'm still an embryo with a long, long way to go.  And just tell them that.  And I'm never going to, they're never going to beat me down again.  Oh, yes, I am wise, but it's wisdom from my pain.  Yes, I'll pay the price, but look how much I gained. 
[01:37:00]  If I had to, I can't do anything.  I am strong.  I'm invincible.  I am woman.  There you go, Patty.  I used to sing that with Rotgut in a dress.  Ugh.  It was wonderful.  Do you have a copy of that?  I might somewhere.  It was very funny.  I beat the hell out of my brother.  Hey, Patty, you doing anything wrong lately?  Because there's a detective on the line.  No.  Robin?  Hello?  Robert, what's your name?  It's Robin.  How you doing, guys?  Oh, there you have Robin. 
[01:37:30]  That's okay.  I just want to let Patty know that if she lives within the confines of the city, which  Staten Island is, and she's been there over 30 days, she will not be thrown out without  a judge saying she has to leave.  Exactly.  There you go.  These people cannot throw her out no matter what she does.  See, Patty?  Especially since you're not bringing drugs into the place or doing anything other than  just being an annoying presence.  I'm not even there.  I'm very good.  I'm a great tenant.  Yeah, I was just going to say, just knowing that you're down there.  Daniel.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing?  Real fast.  Does she ever sign a lease?  Are these people she knows? 
[01:38:00]  How does she find this residence?  I just knew them, and I asked, can you help me out for a few days?  And they asked me if I needed to rent a room.  So I rented the room.  So they're profiting.  What was that?  Do they rent to other people?  Well, no.  What did you just knock on someone's door and go, do you have a room for rent?  You're a friend of who?  I was a friend of the people that I'm renting from, and they were nice enough to allow me  to stay.  Is it their domicile, or do they use it as a... 
[01:38:30]  It's their domicile.  It's their home.  You know, they're just being nice.  And is there anyone else in there that pays rent?  Anyone?  Well, yeah, there's people upstairs, but they're relatives.  Do they pay rent, or do they just live there?  They're relatives.  They do pay a little rent for the heat and hot water and electricity and stuff.  The rules are different between a housing complex, like where you rent, and a domicile,  someone's domicile.  Please stop saying domicile.  Sorry.  Domicile.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, we got Patty's landlord on the line?  Oh, yeah.  Kim?  Yeah.  Is this her?  Is this her, Patty?  Patty knows who I am.  All right.  Yeah.  Hi, Kim.  All right, we'll get to the bottom of this.  How are you?  What is going on, Kim?  What is going on?  Yeah.  A simple request from a landlord not to do such a thing.  And she pays rent when she has money to pay rent, which is almost never. 
[01:39:30]  So put it to you this way.  Kim, why would you boot her?  Doesn't it seem a little odd that a landlord would dictate what she can do as a grown woman?  You know what?  What?  She's been here.  My mother's put up with her.  She eats everything in the whole house.  I mean, she puts up with her.  Give me a break here.  But, but, Kim.  Give us a break here.  All right, Kim.  One little thing.  Kim, I understand.  For not to be a pig on the radio.  Why?  It's not your say, though, what she does in a private life.  She's going to do it, which I already heard her say she is.  Put it to you this way. 
[01:40:00]  My other sister's already putting her stuff outside on the street.  So tell her.  Oh, would you stop.  Tell her I hope she finds it when she gets there.  Why don't you stop it?  She doesn't pay rent.  She doesn't have to live here.  She's signed no lease.  You know something, Kim?  Why are you dictating what a grown woman can do in her private life?  Oh, she could do that in her private life, in her private home.  She lives in a private home right now.  My mother went out of her way to be nice to her, to give her a place to live.  She's not doing it in your house.  She's doing it here in the studio.  But everybody that we know knows that. 
[01:40:30]  And we have to hear it from everybody.  Why are you harping your own morality on another person?  Why?  Well, maybe she'll get some morals.  Right?  Based on your morality.  No, based on her own morality.  Maybe she needs to get a little.  Maybe she...  And then she'll find out that yous aren't really her friends.  She's a virgin, stupid.  You're abusing her on the radio.  She's a virgin.  She's never had sex.  So what are you talking about her morality?  But that's not my problem. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  But what are you talking about morality?  Doesn't it sound like she's quite a moral person?  We're teaching her about her sexuality.  Right.  Well, how much did she learn in the last 10 years?  Well, she's learned a lot in the past four being on this show.  Is this what she has?  Being on this show.  Listen, you fat Staten Island cow.  Mind you, a beeswax.  I am not a fat Staten Island cow, buddy.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm certainly not.  You're built like Toad Hill.  You're awful.  Yeah.  So come over and let me sit on you, you idiot.  I actually would.  There is no reason why. 
[01:41:30]  That's not very moral, by the way.  There is no reason why you should be putting your morality.  How would you do this to Patty?  What kind of pain is a bitch?  Look, she's been nice enough to let her stay in the room because she had no room for her  head.  Patty's crying.  Come on.  Patty's crying, Kim.  She shouldn't be crying.  A simple no is all she has to do.  Well, you can't dictate that, you fat bully.  You know what?  What are you going to drop?  $5 in front of her?  No, you...  She's going to drop $5 in front of her and let her run around like a pig?  That's having morality?  Come on.  Mind your business, fatso. 
[01:42:00]  $5 on the floor, that's going to pay her rent?  None of your business.  It's none of your business.  That's going to put food in her stomach?  She's doing it to pay your rent.  No, she's not.  She's doing it so she has money to get to the city to see you guys.  So what?  What business is that of yours, fatso?  Shut your fat mouth.  That's what she's doing, yeah, my fat mouth.  You have no business telling her what she can or can't do.  None.  No, no, we won't.  After she's out of here by tonight.  See, you threatened her.  You threatened this woman. 
[01:42:30]  I didn't threaten her.  My mother threatened her.  This is my mother's house.  Put your mother on the phone.  No, I don't have to put my mother on the phone.  Why not?  She's the one threatening her.  You're threatening...  She threatened us.  You're using the woman's...  She gave her an ultimatum.  She showed what she wanted to do.  So you know what?  You guys find us somewhere to live now.  Sounds pretty illegal to me.  You're a self-righteous, self-righteous moose.  Why don't you guys give her a job?  You fat, self-righteous...  Why don't you guys give us somewhere to live?  You stupid hole.  Yeah.  You self-righteous ape.  Oh, that's me. 
[01:43:00]  You're a fat, self-righteous C-word.  The nerve of you to impose your stupid, worst-of-the-five-boros morality on Patty.  Hey, you're up.  You're up.  You're up.  Oh, it's your brother.  Oh, hold on.  Hello.  What's up?  Fan of the show?  Yes, I am.  But why would you want to see that thing naked?  Why?  That is, like, totally gross.  He actually raises a good price.  We are going to help her get money.  We're sacrificing our happiness for the listeners. 
[01:43:30]  I would give her money just to get out of my face.  She's so ugly.  Why would you want to do that?  Oh, poor Pat.  Look at this.  Her head is in her hand, and she's weeping openly.  Patty's crying openly here.  I feel bad.  Patty, can you cry next to the microphone?  Hey, dude.  Is that your...  She's crying, weeping.  Hold on.  Somebody's peeping in.  Hey, dude.  Get her home.  Hey, dude.  Get her home.  What happened to the guy?  Where is he?  We liked him.  He was cool.  He's carrying her bed out to the street.  Oh, I'm sure he is.  Are you really putting her stuff on the curb?  Yes.  Why?  Why would you ruin all her stuff? 
[01:44:00]  Hold on.  Hey, Keith.  Keith.  Hold on.  Shut up for a second.  Shut up for a second.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Keith is going to talk to you.  Go ahead, Keith.  Okay, hold on.  Before we get...  Regardless of whether she pays rent or not, Patty has been there more than 30 days, and  she's established residency.  If you put her stuff out to the curb...  Yeah, well, tell her to get a lawyer.  No, no.  It's not a matter of getting a lawyer.  Tell her to get a lawyer.  Her stuff's already outside.  The door's locked.  It's locked the game.  Shut your mouth.  Don't tell me to shut my mouth and live.  He's a cop, you idiot. 
[01:44:30]  Regardless of whether...  You know what?  He's a cop.  You know what?  Hey, Kim.  If she could afford a lawyer, tell her to get one.  No, no.  It's not a matter of a lawyer.  It's a matter of a police car coming to your house and arresting you for putting her stuff  out to the curb.  You go get one.  It doesn't make it...  I'm telling you as a cop...  Hey, Kim, you idiot.  He's a cop.  He didn't put her stuff out of my house.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  He's a cop.  Don't find a cop that's going to change the locks back.  Kim, Kim, you're speaking.  Kim, you are speaking to a police officer right now.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Now, let him tell you...  I'm a police officer.  Let him tell you something.  And bring him here because I'll have my way.  Kim, let him tell you something.  Hello, it's me again.  All right.  What's your name?  Gary.  Gary, listen to Keith for a second.  And tell this to your loud mouth.  Is that your sister?  Yeah, that's my sister.  Man, how do you live with that?  He's just mad because of...  Dude, how do you live with that?  I don't.  I don't live in this house anymore.  You don't?  I moved out.  How was that annoying bitch growing up?  I grew up with five sisters, so...  Jesus. 
[01:45:30]  I got an impression for everyone.  She's upset.  My husband has a gun!  And he may have thought it while you were yelling.  All right, look...  She's still yelling back.  I want to come up there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You seem like a cool guy.  I want some stickies.  I want to put them all over my car, my truck.  Hey, can you slap Kim in the face for us?  I can't do that.  I already hit one in the head with a bat when I was younger.  What, was it her?  She sounds it.  No.  No, really, seriously.  She did it?  She didn't do it.  You didn't?  No. 
[01:46:00]  Why would you seriously want to do that with us?  Throw the money at her and tell her, get out.  Gary.  Let's have Kim talk to Patty here, all right?  No, no, no.  They don't want to talk to Patty at all.  Put Kim on the phone and...  You want Kim on the phone to talk to Patty?  Tell her to talk to Patty.  You're tearing her apart.  You're seriously tearing her apart.  I'll give Kim a slap.  Put stuff outside.  All right, Kim.  You can help her find a new home.  All right, come on.  Jeez.  Hey, dude, is Kim fat?  Yeah.  My mother has been feeding her for 10 years.  I think it's time for her to get out. 
[01:46:30]  We knew it.  Kim is fat?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, put Kim back on the phone.  Tell her we need to talk to her.  All right, but I seriously want to come up there and meet you guys.  All right.  Hey, I'll make a deal with you.  I'll make a deal with that guy.  Joe.  What's the deal?  Hold on.  I'm going out in the hallway for a second.  It's like, here, one second.  If Kim doesn't throw Patty out, you're more than welcome to do that.  No, they're going to do that anyway.  They're not going to go for that.  My mother's got morals.  She ain't going to let it happen.  Morals?  What kind of morals does your mom have?  What kind of morality is it that you peddle on other people?  She's on the streets because she was a nice lady. 
[01:47:00]  Believe me.  I didn't even know that Patty.  Be quiet.  I didn't even know that she was the one that is the stalker Patty that was on your radio  show.  I used to laugh all the time.  Then I found that out.  How can you not tell her that voice?  Gary?  No, I'm not a Patty fan.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Get that bitch back on the phone.  Put Kim back on the phone.  All right.  All right.  But I'm coming up there.  Not today, but I want to make arrangements.  All right.  Well, put Kim on the phone.  All right.  Hold on.  Here's Kim.  Is Keith still on the line?  I'm still here.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, Kim.  Why?  You are fat, aren't you?  I'm not fat.  Yeah.  Your brother told us you're fat.  If you consider 124 fat, then I guess I'm fat.  Well, maybe you were 124 when you were 14, but from what we hear.  No, I don't think I was 124.  Your mom's been feeding you a little too much the past 10 years.  My mom's been feeding Patty a little too much.  You notice how I'm waking?  At least she's skinny.  Yeah, she's skinny.  All right.  Hey, slob.  Guess what?  She wears my old clothes.  Hey, slob.  We want you to talk to a cop right now that is going to tell you.  I don't want to talk to a cop because I don't care. 
[01:48:00]  He's going to tell you what's going to happen about.  And you tell the cop to come here.  And they will arrest you.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  They will arrest you.  You can put all our stuff right in your car.  No, Kim.  They will arrest you.  Kim, I'm trying to give you a hand here with the situation.  Kim, you will be arrested.  You will be arrested, Kim.  You can't arrest me.  Yeah.  Now, Kim will tell you why.  If you want to pay attention for a second, I'll explain to you.  Shut your fat mouth and listen.  I don't have a fat mouth.  She don't listen, though.  Calm down and listen for it.  Listen to the cop.  She doesn't have time to you with that mouth.  I'm ready for the last hour.  Okay.  Listen to me real quick what I have to tell you. 
[01:48:30]  Regardless of whether or not Patty pays rent there, she's lived there long enough to  establish residency.  You can't put her stuff to the curb.  It is by the least.  It doesn't make a difference.  Yes, it does.  It doesn't make a difference.  What's the charge, Keith?  I can't even say she slept here 30 days.  I don't think any of us knew she slept here 30 days.  The point is.  It's on video tape proof.  Exactly.  It's because she stays in the city.  Exactly.  It doesn't make a difference.  She sleeps in the city.  From the first day, her stuff has been brought to your house and she has access to the house. 
[01:49:00]  No, no, no.  Her stuff's been in the basement.  She has established residency.  My mother let her floor stuff in the basement.  Nice try.  No.  Here's what's going to happen.  Oh, man, Anthony, so it's the worst show in the world.  Oh, no.  That hurt.  Patty, you know what?  You should do yourself a favor and get out of this situation.  She's stored her stuff in my mother's house.  So go get a cop and all I'll tell them is her stuff was stored in the basement.  And they're going to tell you, let her back in the house or you will be in the back of the car.  Right, Kim.  That's how it works, Kim.  And it's 100% honestly the truth. 
[01:49:30]  I have my lawyer right here waiting for him.  Lawyers mean nothing.  He'll go to the station house with you.  Yep.  And he will do nothing for you except waste your time and your money.  You'll still have to go down to the station house.  You know what?  Don't you think her life is hell already?  You're going to make her do this and go through more hell?  You're the one making it hell.  You're going to live out on the street.  She's going to live out on the street.  You're the one making it hell.  And I hope you guys are happy about yourselves.  I really do.  You're the nightmare in her life.  I'm not a nightmare.  I have been nothing but nice to her.  And you already said she lives with you. 
[01:50:00]  You already said she lives with you, and now you're saying she doesn't?  And this is all being taped, you idiot.  Kim, Kim, you fat, you fat fucking cunt.  Don't say fat.  That's not my life.  How are you doing that makes you have a nut house?  Who is that that keeps picking up the phone right now?  She sounds hot.  Who's that?  She sounds hot.  How old is she?  She's too young for you.  How old is that?  Believe me, it's pretty young, my limit. 
[01:50:30]  You'd be surprised.  Hey, Kim, how young is your daughter?  Too young for you.  How old?  How old?  Not interested.  How old, bitch?  Too young for you, bitch.  Oh, well, she called me a bitch back.  Hey, someone wants to know if you claim Patty.  Do you claim her on your taxes?  Why the hell would I claim her on my taxes?  All right.  Because she's skinny enough for you to eat.  Hold on.  I want to go to Frank.  Go.  Frank.  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Go ahead, real fast.  Hey, listen.  If her lawyer's there, why don't you throw up a power of attorney for them? 
[01:51:00]  Chances are, if she's sleeping in the hovel of a room, they're not claiming that income.  But if they get 10-7, are they claiming that income or what?  Patty, you pay cash?  She never paid anything.  Patty pays cash.  She never paid anything.  Oh, Kim.  Oh, Kim, I bet the IRS would love to hear about the cash rent that's being paid.  Go right ahead, because she hasn't paid anything yet.  Oh, what about the people upstairs?  My mother's still waiting.  She's paying.  What about the people upstairs paying rent?  Doesn't make a difference if she paid.  She doesn't pay rent, you nitwitch. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Kim.  Her daughter lives upstairs.  Kim, can we talk to your retarded son?  No.  Why not?  I don't have a retarded son.  Where's your trainable?  Where's your trainable?  Where's your trainable?  You so blue.  Put your hot little daughter on the phone.  Put your hot daughter on the phone.  No, my hot daughter's not getting on the phone.  Unless she's a fetus.  I want to talk to her.  Where's your son with the big watermelon head?  Yeah, she's a watermelon head.  No, your son.  My son's not a watermelon head. 
[01:52:00]  Uh-oh.  Hello?  Hello?  This is about the rent.  This is not about that, anyway.  The rent.  You've been claiming.  You've been taking rent.  She hasn't paid rent in the last five days that she slept here.  She only slept here for five days.  Patty, how much rent did you pay?  Yeah, go ahead.  Patty, how much?  You can figure it out.  I'm already caught up up to this week.  Oh, yeah.  Patty.  So, Kim.  Patty's not a liar.  She's a little weirdo, and she's not sexy, but she's not a liar.  She doesn't know.  Patty's not a liar.  Patty paid rent was on Friday. 
[01:52:30]  Friday, she paid rent.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  I'm all caught up, too.  Okay.  If she says so.  So, what's your problem?  If she says so.  She wouldn't.  Patty's not a liar.  I don't know nothing about that.  Yes, you do.  I don't know who she paid it to.  It wasn't me.  You're the worst.  You know, you really are the worst liar.  Well, then it seems like you've got no business in this, then, do you?  You're the truth, even when you lie.  You're nosy Nancy.  I'm not a nosy Nancy.  You're a nudge.  Look.  You're a real nudge.  When I get phone calls on every five minutes, because she's on the radio exploiting herself 
[01:53:00]  all over the place.  Oh, stop it.  And you guys are sick and shit, Lord knows where.  Kim, why don't they mind their business?  Why don't they mind their business?  Mind their business.  All right, so what's the surprise that she's going to get?  None of your goddamn business.  She doesn't know about that part, right?  You don't listen to the show.  You shouldn't even know.  No, I don't, but I know enough people that do it.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Yeah, why don't you mind your beeswax?  Right.  And she knows it's a special trick.  Why don't you mind your own beeswax?  If you can't so much about it, get her a home to live in. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, you don't have to give her the third degree.  You're a busybody.  You're a busybody.  You know what?  Up to today, we were friends.  Kim, ever since we've been on the phone, you've had a home to live in.  You've had a real bee in your bonnet.  Up to today, we were friends.  Yeah, it really sounds it.  Up to today, we were friends.  I'll say it.  We put her on the spot, and she chose.  You guys, and you guys could give her a place to live.  So, Kim, you think it was your DNA that was effed up?  You guys could feed her, and it cost an awful lot of money to feed her.  Great human being you are, Kim.  Great human being.  Yeah, I am. 
[01:54:00]  Really, really great.  I am.  Nice, nice lady you are, Kim.  Oh, yeah, and you guys are nice?  You friggin' ruthless bitch.  Kim, who are you?  Yeah, we are.  You guys are nice?  We've given her a social life that you won't allow her to have.  We've given her a social life?  Yep.  Where's her date?  Kim, who had the effed up DNA, you or the guy that banged you?  Where's her date?  You had a hooked up to live with some guy who walks around naked.  What'd you do with the chromosome?  Eat it?  No, you did.  Breakfast.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Patty.  You think it was your DNA that was effed up? 
[01:54:30]  Shut up.  Why are you yelling?  Patty.  You sound like Jake LaMotta when you yell, you fat body.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Hey.  Bottom line is, she does that, she's out.  Big bottom line.  You're all the cops you want.  You're supposed to be a manager.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  I don't lose the weight.  I lose $15,000?  Yeah.  You sound like LaMotta at the end of the movie.  You really are an annoying fat chick.  Yep.  You're an annoying...  Yeah, who's this?  It's Keith.  I'm Sean.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, Angel.  Just ask your mom if it's all right if we post a mugshot on Foundry when she gets locked  up in a little while.  Hey, how about that?  Can we do that?  Good.  We ain't waiting.  Come on.  Bring it on, honey.  I just picture a big fat slob like from the McMartin house in California.  She's not going to do it.  She's not going to do it.  Big fat woman getting cuffed and arrested.  She's not going to do it.  Ugh.  Patty will do it.  She won't.  How much would I bet she don't?  Put Rocky Dennis on the phone.  Yeah, Rocky Dennis.  Look at them talking to you, Patty, like you're some kind of...  Hey, she's not doing it.  That's it.  We all know she ain't going to do it.  Yeah.  She'll do it.  Yeah, she'll do it. 
[01:55:30]  Why don't you find her a home to choose her so worried about what she does?  Use is not a word, Voss.  Oh, shut up.  She has a home.  You're going to kick her out of it because it's something that she enjoys.  We're not going to kick her out because she's not going to do it.  So then we don't have nothing to worry about.  Patty will do it.  Nothing.  She doesn't have to bet she doesn't do it.  Speak proper English.  Patty, are you going to do it?  I want to do it.  There you go.  She wants to.  Why are you keeping a grown woman from doing something, you bitch?  Because a bitch.  You bitch.  Yeah, all right, bitch.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[01:56:00]  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Just because you're not having any more fun in your life because you've got to take care  of your retarded son, don't wreck other people's fun.  Patty, I'm afraid.  All right, so put Patty on the phone.  She's on the phone.  She's right here, silly goose.  All right.  Put that hottie on the phone, Kim.  No, I'm not putting that hottie on the phone.  Put that little hottie on the phone.  What was that noise?  Shut up.  Let Patty talk to Kim.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Talk to Kim.  Sorry. 
[01:56:30]  I don't think it's going to hurt anybody.  All right, so good.  Now you don't have a hole.  Let her talk.  Let her talk, you loudmouth twat.  You have nowhere to live now, Patty.  Why don't you let her talk?  Do what you want to do.  Let her talk.  Hey, John Candybody, let her talk.  It's not going to hurt anybody but you because everybody's going to think you're a pig.  Why don't you shave your head and shoot Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, you fat body?  You look like 150 pounds of tube.  I don't know I'm playing a game.  You talk about abuse.  What are you doing to her?  You shaved her head and made a ball. 
[01:57:00]  Guess the court don't get that.  And you throw her out on the street.  It looks great.  A week before Christmas, you throw her out on the street.  You don't give her any weight.  Her hair looks great, you bitch.  Oh, yeah.  It looks great now because you had some.  Shut up.  Goodbye, my darling.  Let Patty talk to Kim.  A week before Christmas, you throw somebody out on the street and you're our friend.  Would you listen to Patty, Kim, for two seconds?  Let her talk to you.  You're built like Pauly from Rocky.  Shut up, fatso.  Let her talk.  Patty, talk to Kim.  My friend Steve once said that at the YouTube.  You know what, Patty?  Let her talk.  Oh, my God. 
[01:57:30]  Shut up.  You fatso.  Shut up.  Shut that trap.  I can't get a word out.  No, you never will with this fatso.  You can't get a word in edgewise.  That's right.  You piece of Staten Island filth.  What people don't get is that it's only a show.  Right.  It's a show.  Yeah.  Oh, if it's only a show, why do you got to run around like a pig picking up money?  Why don't you just give her the money?  Do you feel that?  Because it's a show.  Because that wouldn't be a very good show.  But if she's such a friend, why don't you help give her some money?  Why don't you give her some money so she can find a place to live? 
[01:58:00]  Why don't you just go in there and help him take the pigs out of the map?  Why don't you buy her dinner once in a while?  We do, you twat.  Why don't you win?  We gave her new feed.  We give her cash all the time.  She got new feed because of us.  Her new feed are because of us.  Her feed is.  You take a look at them?  Yeah.  What about them?  They've been fixed for free, stupid.  We got her all the bad hair removed from her body.  Oh, God.  Something we don't talk about on the air.  We all give her cash.  And she has a social life. 
[01:58:30]  She was at Ron and Fez's party a couple of weekends ago.  She's got a YouTube for free.  She goes to YouTube concerts.  So where are all the dates?  And what do you do?  You threaten her.  You threaten her.  You threaten her to pull the roof off over her head.  She puts her ass at her job just so she makes enough money to go visit you guys in the city.  She has more self-esteem lately.  Is that the retarded kid or is that the other daughter?  That's the hot little daughter, right?  Yeah.  Huh?  Who's the one with the big melon head?  Who's the one with the big melon head?  Patty?  We caught some kid on film. 
[01:59:00]  From your house.  Hey, did you show that daughter of yours the belt and pads video yet?  Go ahead, Patty.  Finish what you want to say.  Look, it keeps laughing.  All I was trying to say is what Steve said to you, Opie, at the YouTube contest that what  people don't get is that it's only a show.  There you go.  Just a show.  Well, then guess what, Patty?  Let Steve take you in and you go live with him.  I don't see him offering to you.  Hey, what have you done in your life that you're so self-conscious about this kind of stuff?  You see him offering you a place?  Huh?  Yeah, what have you done? 
[01:59:30]  You sea dumpster?  What have you done?  I think one simple thing, one simple thing asked of her wasn't too much.  Huh.  You know what?  I can't believe you guys.  What kind of damage did that giant head do coming out?  Seriously now.  Come on.  You don't want anybody.  This is serious.  This is ridiculous.  Yes, it is ridiculous.  You know, maybe we're a little sick of you's abusing the hell out of her, right?  Oh, bull.  You're the one throwing her out on her ass.  No one's abusing her.  No, no, no, no.  We gave her a life.  Yeah.  You guys threw her out on the ass a week before Christmas.  We gave her a life. 
[02:00:00]  How much do you pay?  Who wanted to take a rent?  How much do you pay your mother?  I don't pay rent.  I live here.  This is my mother's house.  You have two kids and you don't pay rent?  You loser.  No, I don't.  You low life.  What a zero.  Get a job and get a home.  How old are you?  I have a home.  How old are you?  I have a beautiful home.  How old are you?  How old?  How old are you?  How old is she, Patty?  I'm 33.  How old?  How old about her?  Is your kid with the big head a trainable?  How old?  Well, everybody's in about their 30s.  About their 30s.  You're living at home with mommy. 
[02:00:30]  And you don't pay rent.  With mommy.  How dare you?  You can't even support yourself.  Yes, I certainly can.  Why don't you?  Bull.  Why don't you?  Bull.  Why are you so mean?  I'm not mean.  You guys are mean.  You are horrible.  You're a horrible woman.  You're butchering English language.  You guys are really horrible.  You're a horrible woman.  You're a tubby.  I can't believe you're going to make her shoes.  She's mean because she has to change diapers.  For a few ratings and for a few extra bucks in your own pocket, you're going to let her  You are making her shoes.  No, you guys are. 
[02:01:00]  You and your fat ass.  No, you and your fat ass.  You know what you are?  You're a curmudgeon.  How could you call me a fat ass?  You've never even seen me before.  When was the last time you got some?  Well, I know you're a fat ass.  When was the last time you got some, Kim?  Well, I know you're a fat ass.  It was a while ago, wasn't it?  Boy, you must be itching for some big fat C, huh?  I bet you're itching for it.  And I bet you're itching, too.  When was the last time, Kim?  I bet you're itching, too.  When was the last time, Kim?  Be honest.  When was the last time you had a nice piece of man meat?  Tell the truth.  I never did.  Oh, bull.  Yeah, a virgin with two daughters.  I don't have two daughters. 
[02:01:30]  Or a son and a daughter, whatever you want to call it.  A son with a Cartman head.  Put that...  How old are your kids?  I don't have any kids.  You just said you had a daughter.  No, I didn't.  You're a lion sack.  I said that was my sister.  No, the younger one is your daughter, you lion sack.  Stop telling tall tales.  You're Fanny Fibber.  All right, Patty's going to do it.  Patty's going to do it?  Yes.  Oh, who, with you?  She's going to shake this hot little rump all over the studio. 
[02:02:00]  She's going to do it with you?  She's going to do it with you?  She's going to do the contest.  She's going to do it with her?  How many camels you smoke to get your voice like that?  She's going to do it with you?  She's going to do the contest.  She's going to shake her little moralist rump all over this thing.  I hope you're checking the ads in the paper for a room.  You don't have to.  Not too many people will take her.  Keith just addressed you.  Keith just addressed you.  You know what?  She doesn't have to because she's going to do the contest and she's still going to be  sitting on your couch.  You know what?  All I have to say to you is enjoy it.  She has to leave until you smoke through the whole thing.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy it. 
[02:02:30]  How many camels do you have to smoke to get a voice like that?  You've got a great pleasure.  It's sexy.  It's a sexy voice on Demi Moore, not on Jackie Gleason.  Who are you anyway?  Who are you?  Shut up.  Who am I talking to you anyway?  Shut up.  We're radio stars.  Who am I talking to you?  Yeah.  What nobody am I talking to you?  You're talking to the star of the movie Spider-Man too, you idiot.  Yeah, I'm Spider-Man's sidekick.  Is this Officer Anthony?  It's Fez, actually.  How many loads have hit the back of that throat to make that voice sound like that?  Huh? 
[02:03:00]  Red.  How many?  How many?  Red.  Well, Kim, Patty will be doing this.  Well, good.  I hope Patty has some way to live when she's done.  She's going to live in your house.  No, she's going to live in your studio.  She's living in your house.  And your life becomes a nightmare.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it most certainly will.  You should be ashamed.  My life's going to be a nightmare.  What do you think you just did to her?  You should be ashamed charging 25 bucks a week for that hole that we saw her live in.  You know what?  That hole.  That hole.  She lives in the living room, the kitchen, the bedroom. 
[02:03:30]  She takes over the whole house with these kids.  Oh, I'm sure.  She's a shy little thing.  You're lying.  You're lying.  There's a roof over her head.  You probably make her mop the floor.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, we use our head for a mop.  Patty, Patty is Cinderella.  Cinder Patty.  Cinder Patty.  Cinder Patty.  A little foundling with bad feet.  Yeah, Cinder Patty.  And you're a wicked step twat.  All the nightmare daughters, and you got Cinder Patty over here.  Yeah, you're just mad because your belly dangles.  Right. 
[02:04:00]  Like a bowl for the jelly.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You douche.  My belly jiggles, he said.  Ha, ha.  Because you're fat, right?  I'm not fat.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Some guys like the big fat asses.  Yeah, like I said, if you could call my weight fat, then all right, I guess I'm fat.  It's not your weight.  So were they able to figure out how you had a big-headed son?  I don't have a big-headed son.  Yes, you do.  Uh-huh.  I certainly do not.  There's a big-headed person in that house somewhere.  There's a big-headed person in this house.  Yeah, Patty.  When she comes. 
[02:04:30]  You really do have the timing of diarrhea in the ninth inning.  Do you know that?  Whenever you try to make a joke, it's awful.  I wasn't trying to make a joke.  Shut up, stupid.  All right.  Let me finish.  You stink, and I don't like you.  Wow.  Oh, she hung up.  She got the Spider-Man line, and she hung up.  She hung up.  See how we help you, Patty?  We make you stand up for yourself.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Now go home and get kicked out.  Yeah.  Go back alone and be humiliated.  Let us know what happens when you get home. 
[02:05:00]  Go home and get kicked out, and we'll be right on the scene.  Take care, Patty.  Keith, you got some connections, right?  All I'm saying is, Patty, if you go there and your stuff is on the curb, pick up the phone,  call the police, and you'll be sitting back inside within 15 minutes.  They don't have a choice.  Whether or not they say they're putting you out, they can't put you out.  You live there.  And keep eating their food, too.  Especially if you're paying, what, 25 bucks a week?  Yeah, I do.  And I'm brought up and I'm current.  That's the problem.  After the contest, Opie, they don't want to take the money. 
[02:05:30]  And Patty, stop buying us gifts.  Yeah, enough with the gifts, please.  Okay?  Keep the money yourself.  She made a good point there that she's working hard at buying Anthony one beer for his birthday.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop with the gifts.  I got plenty of beer.  We don't need beer.  You see our back office?  We don't need gifts.  We have plenty of beer.  Now, shit worse comes to worse, and I don't have a place to sleep anymore.  Well, then it's your own goddamn fault.  Yeah, that's what you get for showing off and burning bridges.  You know, you shouldn't burn bridges.  These people help you.  You were given a choice. 
[02:06:00]  For the love of God, you picked a house, you dummy.  Yeah, you got to be a little smarter.  Yeah, you're stupid.  These are a bunch of girls and ladies that really care for you.  Us, we just use you for good radio.  We just use you for radio.  You know, so you got to realize you can't be stupid.  You know, push comes to shove, you got to live your life.  Yeah, this was a test.  You made the wrong decision, man.  Yeah.  But anyway.  I can't believe you were making fun of that kid's head size.  Is there a big-headed kid in that house? 
[02:06:30]  No, nobody in that house has a big head.  Remember, Patty, it's just a show.  You can't sacrifice a roof over your head.  Patty is so nice, man.  Patty is really nice.  You're a nice person.  You're an ass, but you're a very nice girl.  You're nice.  And she just has the best intentions is what it is.  You don't know whether to kiss her on the cheek or just beat her until you feel a little better.  Senseless.  I mean, the reality is, Patty, we don't have time to help you.  We're going out with our agent tonight.  We got a big meeting with a TV network tomorrow.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, we're meeting with producers and stuff. 
[02:07:00]  Can't be bothered with the likes of your problems.  And it's not that I don't care about you, but there's a lot of, you know, cast parties.  Of course.  Look at this.  $114 million gross.  I didn't mean to be so surly, truck driver.  See, it's the guy.  Why don't you go call Kim back and smooth things over there?  Why don't you smooth things over with her?  Give her a call off the air.  Use the phone outside.  Okay.  Smooth things over.  And smooth things over with her.  And let us know how it goes.  And come back in then and let us know what your choice is.  Tell her you were feeling the pressure on the air and you made the wrong decision. 
[02:07:30]  Your diaper's looking a little better.  Yeah, that cane is a great accent.  I think when they fixed her feet, she holds her ass different.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah.  All kidding aside, if Kim F's with Patty, help us out.  We'll send the troops over there.  Not a problem.  I'm sure we can take care of it.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Later.  Wow, was she annoying.  Keith is just trying to tell her the deal and she's not listening.  Let me tell you something.  I told you we were going to go off on a little tangent there.  Ock, ock.  Oh, my God.  Look at the time.  We've been on the air for an hour straight without taking a break. 
[02:08:00]  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Now.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We have a great idea as far as Stalker Patty goes coming in from Beth from Virginia. 
[02:08:30]  Where's Stalker Patty?  We want to make a deal with her.  Oh.  We'll do a let's make a deal segment here.  Let's make a deal.  She's very strapped for cash.  She wants to get involved in this money snatch that we have going on on Wednesday.  We're going to get more contestants in a little while.  But now it seems that the people that her landlord doesn't want her doing this.  And it's threatened that if she does indeed go ahead with the money snatch contest, she  will be thrown out of her place of residence. 
[02:09:00]  We got her on the phone and we were yelling and screaming at each other.  It just doesn't seem right that she should hold the very roof over her head over her head.  That's right.  I believe, Patty, didn't you call your landlord?  I did try to call the house, but they hung up on me and wouldn't talk to me.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Well, I guess they're angry.  Well, that's silly.  Do you owe them any money?  No.  I paid up for this past week.  They're not angry.  It was to owe another rent this Thursday, which I... 
[02:09:30]  They're not angry, Patty.  It was just feeding time at the zoo.  But anyway, they said we don't know a Patty click.  What?  We don't know a Patty...  Oh, dead to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That kind of thing.  If you want to see our house, Retard, you let me know a day in advance so I'm not here.  You know what?  No, we're going to do...  Never marry a wop!  Do you have to work tomorrow, Patty?  No.  No?  I don't have to work until Thursday. 
[02:10:00]  Okay, this is what we're going to do.  How about you sleep on the couch tonight outside the studio?  And Ron and Fez will check in, see how you're doing tonight on their show here in New York.  May as well.  I'm too uncomfortable to go home.  Well, home.  Yeah.  Well, like, you know, you have...  Hey, Joyce.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  What's up, Joyce?  I'm just really worried about Patty.  You know, I mean, I know that how we all feel about her, but I mean, this is a person  and it really concerns me.  Well, how do you feel about Patty, usually? 
[02:10:30]  Eh, okay.  Well, she's harmless.  My God.  If she's 90 pounds soaking wet, what harm could she do?  That whole tirade.  I'm kind of pissed off that other people are abusing our Patty.  Yeah.  I am, too.  It's like we could abuse her, but no one else can.  Right.  That's right.  She's a friend of the show.  She has privileges of being abused.  You think if there's a battered wife out there somewhere and some other guy comes up  and smacks her, the beating husband is going to allow that?  Yeah, exactly.  No, he's going to beat the crap out of him and then her when they get home for making 
[02:11:00]  eyes at him.  Joyce, Joyce, could you help Patty out?  Because I got to tell you something.  Right after the show, Ann and I are going to be wined and dined somewhere.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, they have a very important dinner.  At one of the finest restaurants in New York City.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have time to take care of Patty's problems.  Oh, my.  You know, from 3 to 7, fine.  We'll discuss them all we want.  After 7, I don't even want to know about her.  At 7.02, hey, you're on your own.  Then I turn like Kim at the house.  Patty who?  You know.  I have to say that, hands down, it was Anthony Norton and then Opie. 
[02:11:30]  You guys took care of her and I really was very glad you stepped up to the carpet.  See, I was very defensive of Patty.  You were.  You were.  I was waiting for Norton to eat of her life, though.  Do you know I could have equally turned that around and made it sound like Kim had a valid  point?  Yes, you could have.  I went right for the jugular.  You went for the retarded kid.  I don't mess around.  You figure out what's going to hurt him and you go right there.  I wanted to say that.  I wonder if she's cranking Big Head Todd and the Monsters at her house right now. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, God.  I wanted to tell Patty that.  This is your reference for you.  Figure it out.  Go ahead.  I don't want Patty to go back to that house tonight.  Uh-huh.  No, no, no.  I mean, if I have to take her to a place to stay, yes.  I mean, I will take her.  A place to stay?  What is that?  Where?  Take her to your house, Joy.  She's not going to bite.  No, she's not going to bite.  She's welcome to stay at my house if that's what she wants.  I have fleas.  But she's not going back to that hellhole.  She's paper trained.  With that crazy woman?  That crazy woman, do you know what she'll do to Patty?  I bet you she's farting on Patty's pillow right now.  I bet you. 
[02:12:30]  I bet you she's got her stuff strewn across the boulevard over there.  A big, fat ass.  Yeah, rubbing her.  Patty.  Retard pumping C all over the.  But if Patty wants help, of course, I'm here to help her.  Of course, she's a friend of the show.  How am I not going to help?  Retard water slide that she calls a C.  Oh, my God.  Anthony.  It's like a ride at Dorney Park.  Oh, my God.  Your IQ must be this low to ride.  Oh, my God.  We're trying to be serious here, aren't we? 
[02:13:00]  I want to come out with a tube.  All right.  Well, what are we going to do?  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't think she should stay in this tube.  All right.  We're going to be.  Stay with me or she really wants.  She's uncomfortable, which I can understand.  All right.  Wait.  Let's talk this out.  Patty?  Patty?  Yes.  How much money do you need?  How much money would you say you need to have to just survive?  Patty, what would take care of you?  Not crazy.  For the next week or two.  I'm like, you know, for the next week or two. 
[02:13:30]  How about for the next day or two?  It is New York.  Well, I guess to find lodging and get some place.  Lodging.  Lodging.  All right.  Lodging.  It's a lodger.  This is in Wyoming, Patty.  Yeah.  Oh, I know it's not.  Find lodging.  Maybe you could find a little bed and breakfast.  Manhattan.  Oh, sure.  On 57th Street.  Down at the Lodge.  Patty, give us.  I'm thinking here titties.  Oh, my God.  Give us a number.  Joe's a lodger.  I don't know.  I, uh. 
[02:14:00]  What are your expenses, Patty, right now?  22 bucks.  Well, right now I'm giving them 25 a week and I'm paid up.  You paid up through what, though?  You paid up through this week?  I paid up through this past week, yes.  I was going to owe for this week, which I pay on Thursday.  So, you can use some money, right, Patty?  You can use some money.  Now, Patty, and I can't help but notice that your hair is growing in very nicely.  It looks very good.  It does look nice.  Yeah.  People think I got it cut and reshaped, but now it's growing in.  Yeah, because it's like it's just the way it's growing in. 
[02:14:30]  You haven't gotten it cut since we shaved it, so you could go to see you, too.  You haven't cut it at all, and it's growing in very nicely, like a styled haircut.  It's been growing in for about six or seven months now, and it's starting to look like something.  Longer than that, right?  Yeah.  I think it's quite lovely.  October 23rd, I got it cut.  October.  How much spending money did we give you for the U2 show when we shaved your head and gave  you those great tickets?  Yeah, you gave me $200 or something.  Oh, my God.  I used it for the rent. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I gave it to a landlord.  Joyce, we give her money all the time.  Oh, my God.  You guys are awesome.  Well, you know, we try.  Jeez.  I don't like that.  Us and Jerry Lois, we're the best.  Oh, my God.  We're philanthropic.  But, Patty, your hair is looking really nice.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Appreciate it.  Patty, we need to get your...  Hold on.  Hold on, Joyce.  Patty, it's time to play Let's Make a Deal.  Patty, we've seen the notice you need money, cold, hard cash, to live the life you want 
[02:15:30]  to live.  Am I right?  You're kind of in financial destitute.  You need money for rent, money for food, money for clothing, right?  Maybe for transportation to get around to that job once your gimpy little gam gets a little  Mr. MC, I'm good for $100.  You know something?  I'm good for $100, too.  Patty, that's $200 right now.  Let's see if Jimmy's in.  Jimmy?  Jimmy, what are you in for?  Jimmy, what are you in for?  You gave me $25 already. 
[02:16:00]  Well, yeah, since Jimmy doesn't make Opie and Anthony money, he'll be good for less than $100.  All right.  How much if we could get a dollar figure from you?  Don't be shy.  It's okay.  $50.  $50.  Is that on top of the $25 you gave her, or with another $25, that'll make $50?  No, Pete, put on the spot.  It's not on top of it.  So you're talking that's $75.  No, that's $50.  Oh, okay, $25 makes $50.  Why don't we ask what the uncut producer is in for?  Or how about Herky Jerky Ben?  Jimmy? 
[02:16:30]  What is he in his big balls?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  That's very generous.  I owe you $20, right?  Can I put it toward this?  You know what?  I'm never going to see it, so I might as well.  Anthony, how much is that?  I'm good for $120.  $120.  I'm good for $100.  And he actually owed me $40.  Anthony, I'm good for $140.  Wow.  Are you going to match me yet?  I can only go $100 because the $40 went to two pot pies at the goddamn Brooklyn Diner this  afternoon.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, I was a little short, man.  I got $0.70 back from $40 for two pot pies. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  No crap, huh?  Why would you buy that?  Because I'm stupid.  You're so nice.  I'm stupid.  I'm stupid.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh, my hands.  You're so stupid.  You're so stupid.  I'm good for $140.  Anthony's good for $100.  Yeah, I'm good for $50.  All right, we're talking $190.  $290.  $290?  $290.  I'll push it up to $300.  So I'll go $320.  Sweet is good for $110.  I'm good for $110. 
[02:17:30]  Get the black man in here.  Where's the Negro?  Get the colored folk.  Norton again doing his Ben impression.  Ben, are you good for any money?  No.  Ben.  Ben, nothing?  Ben, we're helping out a friend in need here.  Nothing, Ben.  You're good for nothing.  I'm putting $140 in.  He's putting $110.  I'm in for $110.  He's putting in another $25.  That'll be up to $50 for him.  We're talking $300.  Give me a $10, Ben.  What does he got?  That rhymed.  Oh, he's giving him a... 
[02:18:00]  Give me a $10, Ben.  He gave him a quarter.  You're telling Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  He's half as good as he says he is.  Gonna have to play me to prove it.  Oh, Nicoletta.  I got, like, a Nicoletta.  I got a Nicoletta.  No, I went ahead and I just sent it out.  She's talking now.  Uh-oh, look at this.  Jeff Norris.  Hold on.  Kung Fu Comic is on the phone.  God, anything to get on the air, huh, Jeff?  No, that ain't true, you dick.  Some of that lucrative mini-wheat money you're going to want to cough up.  Oh, that's right.  It's a mini-wheat guy.  Mini-wheat money.  You may have heard Jeff Norris on the mini-wheat commercials. 
[02:18:30]  He's the frosted side.  Give us a little, Jeff, please.  So everyone knows?  I'm sweet and delicious and Patty is harmless and pathetic.  Right.  There you go.  I'm going to match Anthony with $100.  $100.  I'm putting in $110, but if you want to go with $100.  That's $400 total.  That's $400.  I feel bad for her.  We're looking at $400 now?  Yes.  $400 right now, Opie.  We're up to.  I'll help her out.  I feel bad for her.  Jeff Norris, some of that mini-wheat money. 
[02:19:00]  That's right.  Eight years' rent in her place.  Eight years' rent.  That's what?  Eight months?  Eight years?  What's four months' rent?  Four months' rent, Patty.  That's what she pays?  $100 a month?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll give $100.  All right.  Look at that.  A month rent.  I'll be in the city Wednesday.  I'll come up and give it to you.  Patty, this is all looking very good, isn't it?  All right, Jeff.  Hold on.  What would you do so far?  So far now, we've just got $400.  What would you do with that money?  Look in the papers, see who's renting,  and go give them a down payment. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  $400.  There's a lot of places in New York.  Do you mind commuting?  Hey, is Buzz from Home Alone in on this?  Where's all the guys when we need them?  Where's Sweetie?  Why is he out there?  Where's the angel face?  You've got to ask him around Christmas time.  That's when they play Home Alone a lot,  and the royalty checks come in.  Here he is.  Hey, guys.  Devin.  Devin from Home Alone.  Perfectly rectangular head.  Patty, we're up to $400 and counting. 
[02:20:00]  Devin, hate to put you on the spot.  Anything?  Can you contribute anything to the Patty Fund?  Sure.  Anything.  What do you need?  Well, any amount.  Do you know how many times my movie's on?  I'm loaded.  Wow.  Any amount between $10 and $100 is fine.  Anywhere in between.  Right now?  Yeah.  $11.  Or anything.  No, anything you want to contribute.  What do I got?  A buck.  Look at you.  You're as pathetic as me.  Hit up Macaulay for some cash.  Would you like, would you care for, let's see what I got. 
[02:20:30]  Do you see Macaulay much anymore?  No, not too much anymore, actually.  Because he's got a lot of money for that movie.  Not since the last time.  I haven't talked about him on the show, actually.  He hasn't really.  Really?  He hasn't really returned.  Oh, I bet.  Hey, good news.  Rich Voss is checking in.  Rich?  Hey, yeah.  Tell Patty I'll give her 10 CDs.  10 CDs.  That's a retail value of $12.  Hey, are they donating money to her?  I'll give her $100.  $100?  Oh, my God.  Wait, you mother effers.  If you're saying you're giving money, you've got to give money. 
[02:21:00]  I'll give her $100.  I'm Rich Voss.  But you're dodging your daughter.  How would you give her money?  You know what?  If Rich Voss is giving $100, I'm going to up mine to $150.  And I've got to go up.  Well, that's only 10 more than before.  And Ross is a Jew.  I've got to jump to $100 now.  All right.  You can't jump to $100.  I've got to go to $100.  Oh, my God.  Patty, we're talking $550, I believe.  He's got $100 from Voss.  Now, we're not going to just hand the money over.  No, no, because this is Let's Make a Deal.  Patty, up for grabs right now. 
[02:21:30]  As we speak, $550.  Now, you could use this money, couldn't you?  Patty, what would you do?  You'd find an apartment, maybe, somewhere far away from loudmouth, fat-ass Kim.  Right?  Any place.  Right, any place.  In any of the five boroughs.  You'd be able to eat a little bit on this money, maybe tuck a little way for a rainy  day, buy us more presents, or spend one night in a really fancy hotel and finally feel  like a person.  Right.  It's yours to do whatever you want. 
[02:22:00]  But, Patty, there comes a price.  I really like her hair, Ann.  There comes a price.  You're looking very beautiful these days.  Yes.  She's dressing better, Opie, if you notice.  She's wearing a little bit of makeup these days.  Yeah, I got...  Right?  Got the new feet.  She's got new feet.  No nip hair.  She's walking around, and she's going to events.  Like I said, Ron and Fez, who do the show in New York after us, had an event a couple  of Fridays back.  Patty was there, meeting people, hobnobbing with some of the people, and actually, she 
[02:22:30]  mentioned to me, looking for a little date, maybe, one day.  You're kind of gussying yourself up for that event, aren't you, Patty?  Yeah, I might have one sooner than I think.  Oh, sooner than later.  Oh, so maybe you'd want to get your hair done.  Maybe you want to get your hair done.  Have you gone to any beauty parlor, and maybe you had them look at your hair and said how  they could style it better?  No, not yet, but I read magazines.  Right, and you look at some hairstyles that maybe might suit you.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe even get it, maybe go crazy, get it tinted or frosted or something. 
[02:23:00]  Maybe a little color into it.  It's a little mousy now, but maybe if you highlighted it, you know how good that would look?  I wanted to get it a shade darker.  A shade darker.  Ah, yeah.  A shade darker.  So, Patty, what we have in store has something to do with that very hair we're talking about  right now.  You getting the money has something to do with that hair.  We've been talking about coloring the hair, right?  We've been talking about styling it, perhaps.  You've said maybe you wanted a shade darker.  That's fine.  I would like it darker, yes. 
[02:23:30]  You like our own black earl color?  Well, not that dark, but dark, dark brown.  Then it slows down.  Since it's coming in.  Dark brown, because it's coming in.  Right.  Patty, would you like us to maybe pay for that hair coloring?  Wow.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Yeah.  Patty, if, let's say, if we gave you $550.  And it looks like it's going up, because a lot of people that we know and love from this  show are kicking in money.  Uncle John?  Yeah.  Everyone knows Uncle John. 
[02:24:00]  Uncle John, you're good for $100, right?  Yeah, I'll throw $100 in there.  You are really in for $100.  Yeah.  No question.  We got you all on tape, you bastards.  If we do this, you're coming by with the money.  You have my word.  All right.  Thank you, Uncle John.  That's $650.  Whatever you want her to do, I'll do it.  You know how many tortillas you can buy with that money?  Yeah.  I know.  That's not peanuts.  Count it again.  You know, Anthony?  Yeah.  I'm going to throw in another $50.  Stop it.  Nice.  Now I'm cheap.  Nice.  Now I'm cheap, guy.  Because I didn't pay for lunch today. 
[02:24:30]  So I figure I'm ahead of the game a little bit.  That's $700.  What's the total we're looking at right now?  $700.  Honestly.  $700.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm good for $2.  Okay.  It's good for...  I'm going $110.  That's $310.  I'm going $100.  That's $410.  I ain't up in this.  I'll match Norton.  I'll match Norton.  I'll do $100.  All right.  Wow.  Wait, you're doing $100?  I told you.  Because stupid Voss had to call in.  Oh, Voss is in.  All right, so $2, $3, $4. 
[02:25:00]  Devin's in for $100?  Yeah.  Wow.  $510 just in the studio alone.  Plus Voss, $100.  That's $610.  Norton's $710.  $710.  And then Uncle John, $810.  $810.  And these people have to be contacted.  Stinky, stop it.  $20.  $20 from Stinky.  Look at that.  And how about Rick?  Rick?  Rick?  Rick?  Rick?  Rick, he's looking down like the kid that doesn't want to be called during a class.  Rick?  Do you have the answer, Rick? 
[02:25:30]  What do you got, Rick?  Pretend you're sleeping when the uncle creeps in.  What do you got, Rick?  There you go, Gary.  All right, $50.  $50 from Rick.  There you go.  How much are we looking at?  $860, I believe.  Oh.  Plus Stinky's $30, that's $880.  Oh, $880.  You're right.  Juicy Seed fella.  $880.  Wait a minute.  $880 tussleable dollars.  And not to mention the six that was in my pocket.  I put it right down there.  So I'm already outbidding Norton right there.  That's six extra dollars right there.  Right there.  Patty, put that six bucks in your pocket. 
[02:26:00]  Quick.  Right now.  $186.  And Earl?  Earl?  I'll kick in ten.  Ten bucks from Earl.  Oh, boy, look at you.  Wow.  How about $14?  Dan it.  Make it $900.  Dan it.  Dan it.  Dan it.  Dan it.  Or 20.  Boy, keeping all those stereotypes alive.  What are we up to?  Nice tip.  Are we up to $900?  $906 with Earl's 20.  We're up to $906.  No, she keeps that six bucks already, so it's $900 even.  Let's go.  Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  $900 even.  It's time to play.  Let's make a deal with Patty.  Go ahead.  Patty, this is a lot of money now, right?  I already gave her $25.  Patty, you're going to be able to get a place to live and pay the up front, pay the rent,  and have a little left over probably for the type of place you want to buy some stuff for  yourself that you might need.  Or maybe put it away for that rainy day that if you ever get in trouble again, you'll have  a little nest egg ready to build on.  Yeah, I like that.  All right.  Now, as we said, you're kind of putting yourself together now. 
[02:27:00]  You don't have that long, stringy hair anymore.  It's got some body to it.  Have you noticed that?  It's got a little curl to it that we never noticed.  If I dare say, it's tussleable.  It looks just a bit tussleable.  Look.  Norton just tussled her hair.  And the hair moves now.  I had somebody tell me at work that it's probably a good thing the head did get shaved so that  the hair can grow back because the hair will grow back healthy. 
[02:27:30]  Patty, that's a great point.  You take lemons?  You make lemonade?  That's a great point.  Now, you know something?  It does.  It looks like it's been styled already, but we want to have your hair styled a little  bit.  Okay.  And we're looking for a fresh start.  A fresh start.  Right, Patty?  You know that?  A fresh start.  Fresh start.  So, Patty, here's the deal.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Patty, $900 up for grabs. 
[02:28:00]  $906 up for grabs.  All you have to do, we have to shave your head again.  $900.  We shave it down the skin again.  She's holding her head, and the look of shock is in her face, Opie. 
[02:28:30]  She did not see this one coming.  Patty, $900.  And six?  $906 for old chemo head again.  What do you say, Patty?  What do you say?  She looks like the first time she just got a swallow on the back of the neck.  Ah.  What?  The ice salty.  Patty, I do it once a week for nothing.  Patty?  Look at old Jimmy Norton getting movie rolls.  Tustle, tustle.  Patty, $906 up for grabs. 
[02:29:00]  Right now, we will get these people that will get you the money.  Think of what that money will mean to you.  Your hair.  You've gone through this before.  That's almost five months rent in where you're living now, which you're not going to be living  in.  It's almost five months rent.  You wouldn't even have to worry about it.  No, almost five.  Look at her.  She's holding her hair.  You know what she just did?  She grabbed the little mullet back and tugged on it like, oh, she's getting so used to it.  Patty, $906 up for grabs if you shave your head. 
[02:29:30]  The offer's going to go.  Look what it did to Sinead O'Connor.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, whatever you want.  All right, I'll do it if I can wear a wig.  She says, she's going to get a wig.  But will I get a wig?  Yeah.  You get whatever you want with the money.  You can buy whatever you want with the $906.  Yeah.  We'll get a wig.  We'll figure it out.  We'll probably be able to get somebody to get you a wig and bring it down.  Someone go to Spencer's Gifts.  Get that fright wig. 
[02:30:00]  Go to Gordon's Novelty Shop.  Go to the drawer in Sandy Cain's apartment.  Earl, get the razor.  Earl.  You're going to do it now?  Yeah.  Right now.  Wait, what'll I walk out with?  A bald head.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  All right, all right.  But will somebody get me a wig?  Could somebody bring a wig so I don't have to walk out like that?  I can't see if you're doing this. 
[02:30:30]  What's the matter, Patty?  Why?  You need a wig or a hat?  Maybe just a hat.  I need to cover my head.  Just wear a hat.  I need to know or see.  We got hats here.  We got hats.  Will you do it for a hat?  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Oh, my goodness.  What a show we've had today.  Let's make a deal.  Patty is going to once again have her head completely shaved, bald, down to skin.  She has just like gotten started having her hair grow back after 8 months or so of being 
[02:31:00]  completely bald.  It's just starting to grow back.  But now, once again, for $900, she will be completely bald.  $900.  I can't believe it.  Strap her down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Get the race.  Oh, I can't believe it.  Oh, get the race.  Where's Gracie Paul now that I need him?  Oh, you need him.  You got any doubts, Patty?  You got any doubts?  You better voice him now. 
[02:31:30]  I wanted to smash him.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Baldy.  $900, $906.  I'm sorry, Norton.  Teddy Smallis.  $906.  Patty is bald.  Shave her head.  Earl, get the F and raise her.  We're going to shave Patty's hair.  Sinead.  Till she's bald.  Bald.  Bald.  Woo-hoo. 
[02:32:00]  Earl laughed.  It was just here.  The buzzer's on the way.  We don't need Earl.  We don't need Earl.  We don't need Earl.  That's Shwug.  Shwuggy.  Earl.  Earl, Shwuggy, Earl, Shwuggy.  Earl's a Shwuggy.  Shwuggy Earl.  This?  You guys are doing this.  Look at that.  We're really going to do this now.  Yeah, it looks good.  I'm the new Jen Brady.  She's got a big Afro wig on.  Let's shave Patty's head.  Shave her head.  Shave retarded Patty's head. 
[02:32:30]  Retarded Patty.  She looks like a chemo patient.  Yeah.  Mulhering's disease.  Yeah.  The guys in Taco never had it so good.  Dollar concentration camp victim.  Yeah.  She's Patty with a shaved head.  A tool.  Patty.  Got a shaved head.  Got a shaved head.  Load her right on the box car.  Oh, yeah.  And this is for that fat C in Staten Island.  Give her the thumbs down when she gets on.  At least she won't have lice.  Maybe we can hose her down. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look for her colostomy bag.  Yeah.  Because she lost her colon to cancer.  Woo.  That's what she looks like.  With a shaved head.  She looks like a pandemic cancer victim.  She looks just like a progeria baby.  Yeah.  With an eggshell thin skull.  Warsaw ghetto.  Yeah.  Woo.  She should be running through it with a red dress on.  Oh, yeah.  It's funnier than breast cancer. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Woo.  That's it.  Get the razor.  Just got a single out of Sinead O'Connor to you.  Over there, sweetie.  All right.  We've got to break.  I know better.  Damn it.  Damn you all.  I can't believe this is happening.  Oh, my God.  Patty.  Let's get your wicked landlord on the phone while we do this.  Yeah.  That trollop.  I'm going to hang up on a lot of people here because we've got to free some lines here. 
[02:34:00]  Jeff Norris, we've got to let you go.  Norris.  Jeff.  Speedy?  All right.  He's gone.  I'm going to wait to think.  He's like, holy yes.  They were serious.  I'm not giving 100.  And he hung up.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to O.B. and Anthony.com or FoundryMusic.com.  O.B. and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:30]  Anthony, we need the Stalker Patty update.  Real fast, give the synopsis of what went on yesterday.  Yesterday, Stalker Patty wanted to be involved in our Money Snatch game because she is destitute.  She is broke.  She needs money for a place to live.  She pays $25 a week rent.  And her landlord said that if Patty is involved in this filth-ridden event that we are running, that she will no longer be welcome to pay rent and live at this house. 
[02:35:00]  So we got the landlord on the phone, or the daughter of the landlord, some raggy bitch, and said, who the hell is she?  Piling her morality on Patty.  And to go F herself.  And Patty's an adult.  She could do whatever she wants.  She goes, well, she could do what she wants, but it ain't gonna be here.  I'm throwing her stuff out on the lawn.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  So we then offered Patty $906 to once again shave her head. 
[02:35:30]  Shave her head again.  Cut her brand new mullet-ish type hairdo.  Cut it off.  She did that for us about eight months ago or so.  Just starting to grow in.  Right.  It's just starting to look like something.  She's starting to look like a human again, kind of.  Six or seven months later.  So we're like, cut it off.  She looked like Kreskin.  Yeah.  Big friggin' head.  Cut it off again.  And for $906, we were able to collect yesterday.  We ran out of time.  She said yes to the Let's Make a Deal segment.  And we ran out of time. 
[02:36:00]  We had to run out of here right at seven yesterday.  And we don't really know what happened to Patty.  Yeah.  She didn't want to go back to the house.  We were arguing with the sister or the daughter of her landlord for about a half hour.  Patty called the house a bunch of times.  She's like, Patty who?  Patty who?  I don't know a Patty click.  Yeah.  With that voice.  Yeah.  Ugh.  So one of our faithful listeners, Joyce, took hold of the situation, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, Joyce.  What's going on?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  You got the Stalker Patty update? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, after last night's tobacco with that horrible woman, I didn't want her to go back  to that house either.  And I kind of got scared.  So I called Stinky and I said, Stinky, we've got to do something.  So I volunteered to take her back there, get some clothes.  Wait.  Stinky was involved?  Well, Stinky took the call.  Well, what do you want to do about it?  I don't care.  I need to smoke pot.  We could go get her high.  I don't care.  Hi, Joyce.  This is Garrett Stinky.  Awesome.  I'm awesome. 
[02:37:00]  Yes, he is.  And why do I care?  We will find Patty an awesome place to live.  Well, at first he shrugged me off.  He said, oh, come on.  She's going to be fine.  She'll be fine.  I was really concerned.  So I volunteered to take her home, get some things.  I didn't want her to go to that crazy woman's house by herself and bring her back to the  studio to stay overnight.  Then I thought about it and I said, you know what?  I'm not letting her stay in that studio.  So when I got there, she was on with Ron and Fez.  And then when she came out, when they went to break, I said, Patty, listen, I have a surprise  for you.  You're not going to stay in the studio tonight. 
[02:37:30]  I got you two nights at a hotel right up the street here.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  Two nights.  Two nights, last night and tonight she'll be there.  And I just couldn't leave her there.  You know, the decent thing to do is to help out her and the show and to just try to bring  some calmness to the situation.  Hey, no room service at this hotel, is there?  No.  Oh, no minibar, right?  No.  I got him.  Good.  And that's the last we've heard?  No, actually, I spoke to her this afternoon. 
[02:38:00]  She called to tell me that she did go back there and that she was going to be meeting  with you guys later on to give you the whole thing of what went down over there when she  did get there.  Oh, she went back?  She went back this morning.  She went back to Staten Island this morning.  Well, we'll hear from Patty a little later on.  She's supposed to come in to get her head shaved for $906.  That's right.  That's right.  She is.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Well, Joyce, thank you so much.  Hey, anything to you guys for her.  You know, I felt bad.  It was the right thing to do and I stepped in, so I'm glad I did.  I thought you were going to bring her back to your house. 
[02:38:30]  No.  I'm too far.  I'm coming all the way in the Bronx.  She wants to go all the way over there?  Hell no.  That's not the reason.  No one wants to go there.  You got a little scared, didn't you?  Well, yeah.  She's like cockroaches.  Once you have them, there's no getting rid of them.  Right.  That's it.  Because this all started with Joyce going, hell, she could sleep in my place.  Next thing you know, she's putting her up in a hotel.  Yep, yep.  Nice and safe to step away from the situation.  All right.  Thank you, Joyce.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  So I guess we'll hear from Patty with an update, Ant. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Good.  Get Stalker Patty in here.  We've got to get an update.  She's here, Anthony.  I guess we're not going to be shaving our head today.  Paul Mercurio in studio.  We forgot to plug his gig.  He's playing Princeton, Catcher Rising Star in Princeton, New Jersey, Wednesday to Saturday.  Very, very funny guy.  Very funny guy.  Go see Paul Mercurio.  He helps out the show.  We have a girl from New Hampshire, Andy.  Her name's Sandy.  I'm trying to say Anthony and Sandy at the same time.  Hence, Andy.  Too much going on. 
[02:39:30]  Sorry.  Sandy.  Sandy from New Hampshire.  She's been waiting three and a half hours.  She's trying to get into the O&A money snatch game that goes down tomorrow on this program.  Hi.  We have like eight or nine girls signed up for the contest.  Sandy.  Sandy.  Hello.  Sandy.  What the hell is that?  Sandy.  All right.  I guess she doesn't want it.  What the hell was that music?  It was the next track.  Oh.  Everything's going wrong today, man.  All right.  Because, see, it was on continued, Ben, instead of single.  It's like watching a Titanic go. 
[02:40:00]  This is.  It's a disaster.  It happens.  Not my fault, though.  It was on single instead of.  Yeah.  I mean, it was.  Yeah.  It should have been on single, but it was on continued, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, well.  Well, Stalker Patty's in the studio.  Where's Stalker Patty?  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi.  So, what happened now?  Where did you live last night?  Okay.  Well, somebody came through for me.  Oh, my God.  Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  Patty, keep your goddamn clothes on.  Yeah.  The catchphrase. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you.  The catchphrase.  Patty.  Yes.  You had some problems yesterday.  We got in a big fight with your landlord.  Yes.  You're no longer allowed to live at the apartment you were renting for $25 a week.  Right.  You got booted out.  Yes.  We offered you $906 yesterday to cut off what hair you've grown in the past eight months  since the last time we shaved your head.  That's right.  You accepted the challenge.  Yes.  You have now found a new place to live.  Not yet.  What happened is I came back to where I was.  See how quickly I was trying to get this over there.  Found all my stuff packed up nicely. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, it was packed up like they were kicking you out.  In boxes and bags.  Yeah.  And they made me give back the key.  So I did.  And then I just went and called up somebody that called in yesterday who could help me  move everything.  So I got him.  And then I also just found a place to store everything in up on like...  I hope he doesn't move as slow as you talk.  You're never going to get moved out.  But anyway...  Isn't that funny?  They box up all her junk, but she's never had junk in her box. 
[02:41:30]  Isn't that like it's just a strange, coincidental thing?  Bravo.  So now I don't have to worry about where my things are going.  I have a place to store them.  I just have to worry about me now and that's it.  So where did you sleep last night?  In a hotel?  Yes.  Joyce was very nice to put me up in a hotel.  Yeah, no.  She told us all that.  Okay.  Where are you sleeping tonight?  I'm sleeping in the hotel again.  Oh, again.  But then I check out tomorrow at 12 noon.  And have no idea where you're going to be sleeping tomorrow night.  No, but if all I have to worry about is just where I'm going and... 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, she's staying at the Ritz, but instead of an R, it's an SH in front.  So it's almost the same.  You know.  Patty.  Patty.  Yes.  For some reason, do you know Patty's got to go on a date?  What?  Oh, I heard that.  With Al Dukes from Ron and Fez's show?  They bet that Earl wouldn't get into the Rolling Stones conference, but everybody else knew better.  And he got in.  He got in, so now...  Because he's got his connections.  So now wait a minute.  Patty, you don't date.  This is like your first date. 
[02:42:30]  Stop.  Are you kidding me?  I know.  It's crazy to believe, right?  Because Al's gay, so...  Al is such a flaming faggot.  Nothing's going to happen on this date.  Nothing's going to happen.  Your virginity will remain intact.  Do you know she's a virgin?  Oh, I know that.  But I'm very happy to be enjoying my little time.  45 years old.  She's got so much guilt because of the Catholic Church that she has not been able to pleasure her.  Give her one of these self-pleasure kits you've been handing out to everybody.  Yeah, do you have a little toy you could give the girl to?  I have a toy for her and one of my books.  Do you self-pleasure, Patty?  Patty, do you? 
[02:43:00]  Do you touch yourself?  She does to the edge from you, too.  She has a fantasy about the edge from you, too.  Actually, it's just about his hat.  He's my sweater.  Yeah, it's just the hat.  He's obsessed with headwear.  It's harmless.  We've got to wrap this up, Patty, because we're running out of time.  So you have no place to live tomorrow, but it doesn't bother you, right?  No, the half of a load is off my mind with where to put my things.  Again, half a load's off of mine, but there's never...  You know, if all I have to do is just worry about...  Where will you sleep, do you think? 
[02:43:30]  Well, I'm going to make some both walls.  Well, you're off of the couch outside the studio.  Yeah.  Hmm?  You know, that'll be, you know, if worse comes to the worst.  All right, hold on.  Michelle.  You want a good place to sleep?  Go to the play of The Graduate.  You'll not...  I'm not right out.  I know.  So many people yelling to get a good night's sleep, though.  From what I heard.  No one will yell in there again.  Michelle, real fast.  It's not Michelle.  It's Strawberry, but I feel really bad for Patty, and if she needs a place to stay, I'll  be happy to take her in.  Oh, yeah?  No rent as long as she needs it.  Wow.  It's not a problem.  She's a really nice person.  All right, cool.  Hold on to the line, Strawberry. 
[02:44:00]  But you have to look at all of her knick-knacks, which are all strawberry-related.  Our listeners are coming through like crazy for Patty.  Now...  When I heard, it's like inviting a tick to your leg.  It's like it just won't leave.  I think the last person where Patty stayed, they actually had to burn her head with a  cigarette out of the house.  She wouldn't leave.  Because if the head stays, it'll just get infected.  It'll infect the whole house.  Patty, she's got legs like a relief mat.  All right.  Patty, will you be doing the contest tomorrow, the ONA money snatch thing?  Of course.  If I'm allowed to, I will. 
[02:44:30]  You know, if not...  You'll be completely naked with the rest of the girls?  And you know the twist, right?  Yeah, I do.  All right.  All right.  Well, we should let her do it, then.  Patty, you're in if you want to be.  Okay.  All right.  So we'll see you tomorrow.  Absolutely.  I'm not going to be the winner, but okay.  I mean...  You'll scrape up a few bucks.  And you'll allow us to shave your head again for $906?  Sure.  All right.  We just got to figure out when we're going to do that, Anthony.  All right.  Because now we're going to hit the road.  I know.  You know, tomorrow we got the money snatch thing.  Thursday and Friday, we hit the road in Philly and D.C. 
[02:45:00]  I'm starting to think, Ant, that we do it in the middle of our celebrity softball game.  I'll shave her hair.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought you meant to do that.  All right.  In the middle of the softball game, because we could put her...  Her big, retard head.  Yeah.  Right on the big, huge jumbotron.  And everyone could enjoy as we shave her head.  On the jumbotron.  That's what I'm starting to think.  That's fine.  Can we...  After we cut her hair off, can we switch the jumbotron to black and white so it looks  like Schindler's List?  Because...  Write some numbers on your arm. 
[02:45:30]  We saw her with her head shaved last time, and it really looked bad.  I swear to God, it looked really, really bad.  And instead of effing with the listeners and teasing this damn thing, should we make it  official and we'll do it at the club?  Make it official.  We will do it at the celebrity softball game, right on the pitcher's mound.  We will shave Patty's head.  Yeah, that game is Saturday, June 1st, Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears in Newark,  New Jersey.  Can we get one of the Army people that do it?  Yeah, we want this done in seconds.  Just that go...  We'll have a drill sergeant screaming at you the whole time. 
[02:46:00]  You are not worthy!  And we will hand you the money in the middle of the field after it's done.  Okay, Patty?  You have the body of an ant!  Your hump is getting bigger!  My thorax to me.  My t-rex!  Alright, tomorrow is the show we've been waiting for for about a week and a half, Anthony.  I'm coming by.  Come on by.  It's the O&A Money Snatch game tomorrow.  Right, learn. 
[02:46:30]  It is the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, hell, we've got to get right into this show.  Oh, yeah.  Who are we kidding?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The day we've been waiting for.  Money Snatch.  The O&A Money Snatch game.  Money Snatch today.  Makes its debut today.  Here it is.  Which means it'll be making its debut on other radio shows in a month.  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha! 
[02:47:00]  See, just remember this day.  Because this is a little thing we haven't done yet on this program.  We haven't done this.  This is the first time we've done this.  We have never heard of anybody else doing this little wacky twist on this bit.  It kind of sucks that we have to say all this before we do another one of our original bits.  But then, you know, if down the road.  A few months are going to go by.  Right, and then other people are going to claim they came up with this idea.  And we'll get emails that go, dude, everyone knows, like, you guys didn't do this first. 
[02:47:30]  This guy did.  Everyone knows douche and douche from Virginia came up with this idea.  Yeah.  And not you guys.  Shut up.  Mark the date.  Just sit back and enjoy, because today's show, a madhouse.  How can we tell it's going to be insane?  Huh.  By the number of people who never, ever, ever come down here that are wanting to get in today.  Yeah.  You know, Jamaican Mike is coming by.  Oh, when I parked the truck today, I pull into the garage, Mike, I will be up there later. 
[02:48:00]  Of course he will.  I will be up there a little later.  That's when we know we're doing a good show, is when the big black Jamaican comes up from the garage.  Jamaican Mike would not miss a show like today.  Never.  He's going to be, uh, he's going to be taping dollar bills to his Johnson.  That might be a little.  You watch him.  Might be the extra twist in the content.  Ah, who knows?  You know?  I got to tell you, I, I, my hat's off to Stinky. 
[02:48:30]  Stinky has been hanging dollar bills from the ceiling for the last hour and a half.  Well, if you go to the, uh, the awesome cam.  Oh, it's now called the awesome cam?  I think we should change it to the awesome cam.  Can we do that?  I know Scott Colombo's outside.  Perhaps, uh, on the, uh, website where you see stinky cam.  I think it's more appropriate to call it the stinky cam today, Anthony.  Oh, well, okay, then after today we can call it the awesome cam.  Hey, man, I'm done for the day.  Don't expect any more lines from your pal. 
[02:49:00]  That's it?  I get one a day.  Jesus.  I got it out of the way at 3.03.  I'm done.  Check, please.  All right, so it's the awesome cam?  Yeah, if you, uh, look at it right now.  Yeah.  Um, let me pop it up here.  Yeah, okay, you'll see, uh, dollar bills flying around the city.  That's it.  I see a lights, an air conditioning vent, and dollar bills.  Ali's in the house.  Look.  Ali's here.  Ali is here.  There's no reason he should be in the studio.  The word is getting out. 
[02:49:30]  Word's getting out.  What's going on here today?  The word is spreading all over the building.  Yeah.  Ali's here.  Let's hope that's all that's going to be spreading.  Hey!  Oh!  Right?  How about that?  Hallelujah.  Well, there's going to be some spreading.  Sure.  Uh, the good kind, though, Ant.  Of course.  Can I see what the awesome cam looks like so far?  All right.  You go to opianthony.com or, uh, I don't know where else you can go.  There you go.  Oh, well, you got to move it over a little bit.  It's just some dollars.  But it looks like, uh, we have $10 on the ceiling. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Move it over.  There's hundreds.  Look at all that hard work.  Face that stinky dick.  Face that direction.  Are we taking digital pictures so that we can put right up on the website immediately?  Not too low.  Go, go that way more.  And now down.  All right.  There you go.  That's good.  You got a mic in there.  You get the money.  See, look.  Oh, beautiful.  And it gets, uh, the whole feel.  Look at you doing a little Ansel Adams shot there with the awesome cam.  Why not?  Why not? 
[02:50:30]  Very nice.  All right.  We're very excited.  Uh, God, man.  The faithful listeners know what we're doing.  But then you got the dweebs that kind of check us out just a little bit here and there.  So now we got to explain the whole thing again.  Fringe listeners, they're called.  And we need them for the ratings, I guess.  But, uh, the hardcore fans know what's going on.  Of course.  It's the only money snatch game.  We have at least $1,000 that we're giving away today.  Maybe even more, Anthony.  Uh, the dollar bills look like the air fresheners from the movie Seven.  Wow, right? 
[02:51:00]  Remember that scene where they're all hanging up?  Very nice.  Very good.  That's from, uh, Junk Mail, uh, no, not Junk Mail, Jerry.  Who was that?  I didn't even give him credit.  Window Lick.  All right.  Uh, Dogface has a question right off the bat here.  Dogface, what's up?  Hey, Owen, hey, what's going on?  You tell me, bro.  Hello?  Go ahead, bro.  Yes, yes, sir.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Why can't he hear us?  Who's screwing me?  What's the problem today?  Don't hang up!  Hold on!  Dogface!  Hold on! 
[02:51:30]  Oh!  What's the problem today?  I'm sure it's A.  It's not A.  Is it B?  It's not B.  What is it?  Both ons are on.  I think it was dogface.  All right.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  You want to bet?  I bet you the next phone you plunk down, they don't hear us.  Oh, no.  You want to bet?  I'll bet you a buck.  Ooh.  I bet a buck.  I don't know if I get $25.  That's a little steep for me.  A little steep?  I got a couple quarters.  You got to get to the bank.  Let's go to Ken in Virginia. 
[02:52:00]  Ken!  Ken!  Oh, boy.  You owe me.  Oh, boy.  Ken!  Moose Rocco!  Ken!  Help the judge find his checkbook.  Ken!  No, that's not...  No, now I hear the left side of my audio going out.  Stop.  Stop.  Get Pete the engineer.  Get Pete Johnson.  What is the problem today?  Why can't we come in here and have everything said every day?  Dude, Pete will come in here.  And he'll go...  And he'll do it in two seconds.  You idiot.  You got to hit this, that, and twist this.  In all fairness, for Ben and the gang, everything looks like it's... 
[02:52:30]  Are the actual phones a little screwy?  Is there a light there that...  No.  Get Pete Johnson.  Pete will fix it.  Pete's also very excited about today.  Of course he is.  Oh, I'm sure everyone is.  While Pete makes his way down to the studio, Anthony, basically it's the O&A Money Snatch game.  We got at least $1,000.  Yeah, at least.  We're going to work out the kinks in our new bid, and we're going to up the ante in the future.  But we work it out right in front of our audience.  Yeah, for today we got at least $1,000.  If a lot of the girls show up, we're going to add even more money in the studio. 
[02:53:00]  We got a couple hundred bucks already hanging from the ceiling.  The bucks will be on the walls, on the floor.  They'll be everywhere, okay?  The girls are going to march in here completely naked, and they're going to have about five minutes.  Are we going with the five-minute thing?  They're going to have five minutes to collect as much money as possible, Anthony.  Awesome, Garrett.  Why not put some tape on the dollars themselves and stick those to the ceiling so they really got to jump high?  Are you doing it?  Are you?  Awesome, Garrett.  You are awesome. 
[02:53:30]  That's why he's awesome.  He knew what I was thinking.  He read my mind.  Can you read my mind?  So the girls will be naked.  They'll have about five minutes to collect as much money as possible, Anthony.  Yeah.  They don't have any clothes on, so they can't be stuffing the dollar bills anywhere, okay?  Exactly.  There is another twist.  You guys know about the twist.  Anthony's been explaining that to the girls for the last week and a half or so.  Yeah.  And after the allotted time, which we're thinking is five minutes.  We might go a little longer.  I don't know.  The girl that collects the most money, we're going to have to stop the festivities, and then 
[02:54:00]  we're going to have to count all the girls' money.  Count the money.  And then we'll announce a winner.  And at that time, whatever is left in the studio, the winner will get.  Whoever collected the most will get what's left over.  Right.  D-monet.  But the other girls that have collected lesser amounts, Anthony, they get to keep whatever  they collect.  Oh, they keep whatever they collect.  So everyone, Opie, everyone is a winner.  I was talking.  I think Stinky was telling me this.  One of the girls, she has arrived. 
[02:54:30]  What Dogface was going to say, the girls are going to stiff you, right?  No, we worked out the kinks in this.  We have at least five or six girls already here.  We do.  We have five girls upstairs.  Two calls said they're going to be here any minute.  They're just running a little bit late.  Oh.  We got a good turn.  Oh, how about that?  Game on.  Game on.  See, we had to be a little tough to the ladies over the last few days.  We were.  But it's paying off, Anthony.  It's paying off.  I think my questioning helped, Opie.  See, if they would have been chased away by some of the questions I asked, maybe then there 
[02:55:00]  would have been a problem.  I think you got a few dates out of the deal.  Knowing that.  Dates.  Please.  I don't know what the hell was going on with you and the ladies in the last week and a  half.  Knowing that they were able to handle an adult kind of provocative conversation over the  phone like that.  Yeah.  I think it showed that, yes, they would show up.  They wouldn't chicken out.  All right.  Anyway, Stinky was telling me one of the girls that arrived told Stinky that she was practicing  last night.  Oh, really?  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  Would she spread some money out on the floor and pick it up?  She was practicing, Anthony.  Let's just put it that way.  There are strategies to this.  I've been thinking.  Strategies.  All right.  Strategies.  Strategies.  The girls will have to gather up as much money as they can.  True.  But I think the second step, the tricky part that we informed everybody that is a contestant  but not the audience, I believe they're going to have to allot a certain amount of time 
[02:56:00]  to do that.  Ah.  So you might want to spend 75% of the allotted time grabbing as much cash as you can.  Right.  And then 25% of the allotted time then is spent dealing with the money.  Dealing with the twist.  Right.  Dealing with the twist.  You can't just right up until the end have fists full of cash.  You know what I mean?  And then have mere seconds to wonder, how am I going to fulfill the twist? 
[02:56:30]  Right.  You have to collect allot time to get it ready and deal with the twist.  Anthony, the girls are already writing notes and sending them into the studio.  Oh?  We're going to be talking to all the contestants in a little while.  Of course.  Here's something that's been asked a lot by the ladies.  I'm going to hand you the note.  And we have to make a decision on their request here. 
[02:57:00]  Wow.  I say.  What do you say?  I say.  No.  I say.  No.  All right.  Pass the note back to the ladies and tell them no.  Rick.  Rick will inform the ladies that we have decided no.  All right.  For some reason, Pete Johnson doesn't want to help us out today. 
[02:57:30]  Can.  Can.  No.  He still can't hear us.  He still can't hear us.  We can't find Pete Johnson.  We have 20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not hearing us, though.  So don't answer.  Okay, Ken?  We can hear you, though.  Ken, you dick.  Ken, you're a douche.  Ken, you're a douchebag.  Ken, douche.  Hello?  Ken?  Pete.  Here's Pete.  Pete.  Do you hear Ken on the phone?  He cannot hear us, Pete.  Pete, help us out.  Watch Pete.  Watch Pete.  Put him on the clock.  Put him on the clock.  We're a syndicated radio show.  He's on the clock.  He's on the clock. 
[02:58:00]  Pete, the listeners cannot hear us.  We can hear him.  He can't hear us.  Hey, what's up, Ken?  Ken.  See?  See, Pete?  See, he's there.  All right, Pete.  What do you do?  He's going to hang up soon, and we need to talk to this guy.  What do you do, Pete?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Ken?  Ken.  Uh-oh.  No.  Pete is...  I'm hanging if you're there.  No, no, hold on.  Hold on.  I'll put him back on hold.  Hold on, Ken.  Pete is looking over the entire board.  He has no idea.  Wow, this is the longest I've ever seen.  I'm in a quandary. 
[02:58:30]  He's stumped.  Okay, hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  What is it, Pete?  It's not B, right?  What happened?  It's supposed to be AA over there, right?  Uh-oh.  That's right, and that's right.  Yeah, sure.  Pete, who can fix a pinball machine in under 10 seconds.  And the down buttons, Pete, look.  Both down buttons are down.  What happened, Pete?  What happened?  What's up, Mike, Pete?  What happened, Pete?  What do you think?  What are you looking for?  I don't know if it was working all right this morning.  So Pharrell broke it. 
[02:59:00]  I'm pushing buttons.  I don't know what they do, but I'm pushing them.  It's very tough for us to do our radio show if we can't communicate with our listeners.  Yeah, we have to be able to talk to our listeners.  We like to interact with our listeners.  I like Pete.  He fiddles with his pen in his pocket.  He's like, all right, I'm looking for some tool.  Pete is panicking.  Pete?  Pete, what's the deal, bro?  This is very important.  This is a big day.  Huge day.  Okay, look, just keep on talking.  I'm going to check in Master Control.  All right.  Master Control. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, he's going to Master Control.  Master Control.  He's going to the auxiliary bridge.  Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.  Come on, Pete.  Oh, wait, Pete.  Pete's getting naked for the contest, too, by the way.  Uh, Ken.  Yeah.  Ken?  Ken.  Ken.  Ah.  Pete's crawling up into the Jeffrey's tubes of the Enterprise.  Guys, remember that?  Where Scotty used to go all the time and make something spark and that everything was fine?  That's where he's going.  Why don't we cut our losses?  We'll take an early break here.  We'll get, oh, that'll be good. 
[03:00:00]  We'll get some of these out of the way really quick.  We'll take an early break because, yeah, it's going to get a little hectic around here.  Talk to some of the ladies.  It's the O&A Money Snatch game today on the program.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:00:30]  Uh, oh, we just lost Amber.  Can you tell we're going to have a good show?  Like I said, people show up that normally at 3.30 aren't here.  Look who just happens to be here.  Don't you have a meeting to go to, Ron?  Hours before his show starts.  I am filing some stuff in the studio.  I'm putting parts away.  It's called show prep.  I didn't know.  It's something we do in this business.  Ron from Ron and Fez.  You're filing. 
[03:01:00]  I don't think I've ever seen him when the sun has been up.  Yeah, true.  You know what, though?  I'm a little worried.  What's going on out here?  I notice there's some girls and there's money hanging up.  Oh, you have no idea?  I hope I'm not in the way because.  Well, you know.  I need to get these cards done.  I'm a little worried that it's not a good enough show because Fez would have been here  if it was a good show.  Let me tell you something.  Why isn't Fez here watching?  Well, there's girls involved there.  Fez has already got $6,400 stashed in his can.  If that means anything, you guys. 
[03:01:30]  I'll put Fez's butt up.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  I saw him drop a cat in there one time.  He's got room.  Just drop it?  Yeah.  I don't know if it ever hit.  Interesting.  Yeah, so Ronnie's here.  I don't want to knock.  There is a girl out there.  No way is she 18.  Really?  It's that fake ID stuff.  I wouldn't even throw the teen in.  That's all right.  I mean, come on.  What's wrong?  We got to help out the kids. 
[03:02:00]  I didn't order food, Ben.  Relax.  Does she look like a youngster?  She looks like she's selling cookies.  So it doesn't look like she'll be able to collect a lot of money, huh?  Bring her by the door just so we can take a look.  Bring her by the door.  Why don't we just bring her right in?  One of the contestants in the O&A Money Snack.  Let's see how ridiculous.  Let me see.  Where is she?  Yeah, bring her in real fast.  No way is she.  You have to be in here.  Yes, she is.  How old are you?  23.  23.  All right.  He's saying you're like 15. 
[03:02:30]  Okay, fine.  I'm leaving.  That's all.  Really?  She's wearing a wire.  Could be.  I'm just kidding.  I saw you from behind.  I'm sorry.  A lot of people say that you look young.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got some juggage going there, though.  Not after today.  She'll look every day of it after today.  Are you psyched for the O&A Money Snatch game?  Very psyched.  What's your name?  Jewel.  Oh, Jewel.  You're the one that was practicing last night. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  All right.  Ronnie, she was practicing last night.  You have a strategy.  You worked out a strategy.  All right.  She's worked a strategy out for the twist, let's just call it.  We haven't mentioned this on the air.  And only the girls that are participating and the people here in the studio really know what the twist is.  Are we allowed to ask her how she was practicing or what she was practicing with?  I'll just, I think we could ask her, in her opinion, how did you feel your practicing went?  Very well.  Very well, Opie.  Very well.  She made change for me. 
[03:03:30]  Is that true?  She literally was making change.  Wow.  You know, if you think about it, though, that's not good for this contest.  Yes.  Well, she practiced and, well, that's good.  Do you think, based on your practice, that you have a chance to be the winner?  Yes, I do.  Oh, and you have a set strategy.  Yes.  And how long did you practice last night?  About 15 minutes.  Yeah.  That's all it took.  Yeah.  All right.  When Mommy tells you, you know, just don't put that dirty money in your mouth, she meant it. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  She meant it.  You're all right, Jewel?  I'm great.  All right, good.  Great.  Have you done any alcohol or narcotics to get ready for this?  No.  No?  Would you like to?  No.  No.  Well, some of the ladies are partaking.  Some girls like to booze it up a little.  Don't make you a bad person.  It doesn't make you a bad person.  Right.  We can't judge.  We can't sit here and judge.  Who need to judge?  We don't judge at all.  I think God will be the final judge.  God himself is the only one who could really judge us.  A lot of us had tough lives. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  What are you going to do?  See the money hanging all around you there, Ronnie?  Yeah, it's nice.  Stinky's going at it.  Awesome, Garrett.  He's putting some on the ceiling.  I think only high denomination bills should be on the ceiling.  That way they really got to jump.  Yeah, we should tell the ladies it's not all just ones.  Yeah.  Oh, they're camouflaged?  Very good.  Stinky's thinking this through.  Jewel, without grabbing any money, jump as high as you can to the ceiling.  Let me see how high you can get.  She's not going to be...  You're out of the contention for that.  You're out of contention for ceiling money. 
[03:05:00]  Well, maybe we could have like one stool.  They fight over the stool.  Fight over a stool?  Yeah.  Opie?  Interesting.  I want the corn.  I want the corn.  That's an interesting new twist, isn't it?  All right.  Well, Jewel.  Huh?  Oh, that's going to be there.  Don't you worry.  Don't worry.  We can't leave it in there now.  You know, Ronnie in the studio, he's picking up with that drug habit of his.  They're going to...  All my bills are rolled up.  Lick one of the bills for an extra special surprise.  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  Remember the old days?  This last rail, we're doing off of here, honey.  Here it is.  I got one left.  One more to go.  Go fast rail.  See if you can see it through your tears.  There you go, right?  All right.  I'm the only one who ever partied.  One more.  Fine, that's okay.  One more blast.  I'm the only one who ever stepped out.  The only one that has admitted to a few million people.  Ronnie, you're not alone if you've spent the night looking at the carpet, picking up rock 
[03:06:00]  salt from a pretzel you ate years ago, wondering if that was a little bit you dropped.  I used to wake the kids up for that.  Daddy dropped something important, small and white, in the carpet.  Everybody get up and look.  But stay low, we're being watched.  Or Santa will be coming this year.  Right out the window, I swear.  Dude, I saw headlights out there.  I know what I saw.  Don't tell me I'm paranoid.  Classic.  All right.  Well, Jewel, thank you very much for coming in and saying hi. 
[03:06:30]  Take a seat out there and we'll, next time you come in, it'll be for, and our first excuse  for delaying the contest has arrived.  Norton totally got it.  Yes.  Our first excuse that we're going to use.  Why fool around here?  Right.  But we do have a real excuse to delay the O&A Money Snatch game.  What could possibly be?  Amber just called and she's in the Lincoln Tunnel.  Uh-huh.  And she's on her way.  So she told us to delay the beginning of the O&A Money Snatch. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Who are we?  We got to wait for Amber, right?  Who are we?  We got to wait for Amber.  There's no judgments here.  All right.  Very pure.  Very accepting.  There's no judging here.  Tom, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  Yeah, I'm on the FDL Drive in this blonde chick.  I think her name is Beth Atroska, big slut.  She showed me her boobs.  I don't believe that was a real wowing. 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Thank you for that.  I don't think that was a real O.P.  Well, some guy got wowed on the FDR.  On the FDR.  Let's just keep it at that.  You dick.  That was smart.  That was funny, though.  Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  What's going on here, guys?  What's up, Bobby?  Another Shirley truck driver.  Hey, listen.  Just like our own Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, I know.  Stinky cam there.  Another term for the money shot today, huh?  Oh, yeah.  If you go to the stinky cam or the awesome cam, right now you'll see a money dangling from 
[03:08:00]  the ceiling.  And Ronnie.  All right.  Good job.  Hey, real quick, guys.  How about?  Go ahead, Bobby.  Yeah, Flash, if you're listening.  Now he's doing it to other people over our airwaves.  He's getting his friends.  That's pathetic.  You want to talk to some more of the ladies?  Of course.  Yeah, let's get more of the ladies in.  How the hell wouldn't I?  Bring in...  Rick, how many contestants do you have?  How many are out there? 
[03:08:30]  Grab a book.  You've got like nine.  Jimmy, get the dollar bill off of your crotch.  Look.  Look at him.  He's walking around with it taped to his crotch.  Stop that.  Well, guess where the hundreds are.  Hey, how you doing?  Look at this.  Wow, wait.  Beautiful.  I like our contestants.  Lovely.  There you go.  I don't have a problem with the ceiling ones.  Yeah, we got a tall drink of water there.  Wow.  Well, you know, that's not going to be fair to the short girl we just talked to. 
[03:09:00]  No, now she could hit the floor.  How tall are you?  About 6'1".  6'1".  6'1".  One of our contestants, 6'1".  What's your name?  Robin.  Robin.  There you go.  And do you have confidence that you can do well today?  Yes.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Where are you from?  Very good.  Long Island.  Long Island.  Has anyone practiced?  Any of the girls like practice like Jewel did?  With a roll of quarters.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's good.  You can practice with that.  Sure.  And did it go well?  Very well. 
[03:09:30]  Very well.  And what's your name?  Maria.  Hi, Maria.  Hi.  What do you think your chances are of winning this thing?  Well, I brought my friend here, so she can help me out.  I see that.  Oh, are you guys going to work as a team?  Never know.  How is that working as a team?  Is that in the official rules of the only money snatch contest?  I don't know if they could work as a team, Opie.  I've got to be honest.  They didn't have to admit it.  They could have just come as two different people and then decided among themselves,  we're going to split the money later.  That's a, you know?  Yeah, but still, if one's helping the other.  Well, is she actually going to be helping or are they just going to do that?  I don't know how they would actually work out as a team. 
[03:10:00]  We could do that.  It's a little odd.  I think they're both just going to collect and whatever they collect, I don't know.  Any predictions on how much money you think you'll be able to walk away from this with?  At least a couple of bucks.  A couple of bucks.  A couple of bucks.  All right.  All right.  We've got some shy girls in the studio.  Yeah.  Well, that happens.  You all right?  That's okay.  Yeah.  Was I nasty to anybody on the telephone?  No.  Actually, you made me laugh very hard.  Oh, really?  Oh, good.  See?  And what's your name?  Shannon.  Cute blonde with a tongue ring, Anthony. 
[03:10:30]  Very nice.  And Anthony made you laugh?  Really hard.  Good.  See?  I try to be nice.  Yeah.  I wasn't trying to be too rude.  What a pig you were.  I heard everything.  I know.  I was awful.  I apologize.  You know, like I said, I was just reading it out.  Anthony had a job to do.  I was like, I had to do that to make you strong.  I don't know.  What kind of girl?  It was kind of you.  Boy named Sue Logic.  Right.  Terrible.  And have you been practicing or anything?  A little bit.  You practiced a little?  How'd you do?  How'd you think you did?  I think I did very well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good.  You got a chance? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And everyone is clear what this is all about.  There's no misconceptions here.  No, we got some troopers in.  All right.  It's obvious.  I appreciate it.  We haven't talked to the other hot blonde.  Yeah.  Casey.  Hi, Casey.  You psyched for today?  Yep.  You think you could win this thing?  Yeah.  I'll try.  Yeah?  Very good.  Any practice going on?  No.  No?  She has confidence.  She doesn't need to take batting practice.  Can you jump up and hit the ceiling?  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I feel bad for Jewel.  Jewel's like five foot tall.  How is she going to reach the ceiling? 
[03:11:30]  I can't reach the ceiling.  Man, that girl's almost like as tall as Awesome Garrett.  6'1".  Wow.  Awesome Garrett.  Anthony, we threw in something else into the contest.  Yes.  One of the dollar bills has a KR on the back.  Yeah.  Front row Kid Rock tickets.  Whoa.  If you get that lucky bill.  You get that lucky bill.  You got front row tickets to see Kid Rock at Madison Square Garden this Friday.  Is that a padded seat on that front row seat?  No?  Maybe?  Maybe.  Just asking.  Hey, the tall gal, if I could. 
[03:12:00]  Do you have a gentleman friend?  No.  Oh, because I'm just looking at, I'm thinking of AGs in the house and.  Awesome Garrett.  Yeah.  You think Awesome Garrett needs a tall woman?  I really do, yeah.  Are there any boyfriends around here?  Anyone got a boyfriend?  You do?  How does he feel about this?  No, they're.  I'm a boyfriend.  What?  No, these two are like, are you guys a team?  In real life?  Are you lovers?  Hold on.  You're lovers?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  That's great.  That's the best answer ever.  Wow.  And how does your boyfriend feel about it? 
[03:12:30]  My boyfriend was the one who told me to call.  Good boy.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you a fan of the show, though?  We both are.  We listen to you guys every day.  Great.  We love you so much.  And everyone knows they have to be naked, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Completely.  Yes.  Wow.  I can't believe we're pulling this one off.  How do we do this?  I don't know.  Shut up.  You'll ruin it.  Wow.  Because that alone is worth the price of admission.  Yeah.  And the price?  Free.  Free.  All right, ladies.  Well, I guess they could go relax.  We're waiting for a couple more girls to show up, so.  Show it yourself, whatever you need, right out there on the wonderful Ikea furniture. 
[03:13:00]  Have you spoken with Pete Johnson?  He's fascinating to talk to.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Stop.  Jimmy, you are a horror.  You got two of them that time.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, could you take?  He's horrid.  Ronnie, what do you think of the contestants?  Oh, my God.  They remind me of the girls from The View.  I think it's going to go places.  I really do.  We've got all different kinds.  Right.  It's fantastic.  They are all hot, though.  The young version of The View. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, it is.  Got a tall one, a short one.  We're all different girls.  And a noise.  Yeah.  The funny one comes in.  A fun one, yeah.  All different kinds.  A little young looking one.  Make up this world.  The young one scares me.  Oh, no, she doesn't.  Not at all.  Those are usually the ones that walk away winners.  Yeah, I know.  Right?  Hey, Rob.  I gave her the crazy glue tip as well.  Oh, really?  Yeah, dipped in there.  If she could lisp and cry on cue, I'd marry her.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I just have a question.  I have a kind of an idea what the twist may be. 
[03:14:00]  I won't say it, but I want to know how we're guaranteeing that none of these girls are going  to bring some of their own money in already stored.  Ronnie has brought this up, as a matter of fact.  Doesn't want him rat-holing it in here.  You've got to be careful for track trash.  You're always looking for an angle.  We will be examining the contestants before they come into the studio naked.  Are they?  Oh, yes.  See ya.  Interesting.  But anybody who rolls up some bills and comes in that way, they deserve...  Yeah, that's pretty much...  That's nice.  Wow, that's dedication.  That's dedication. 
[03:14:30]  They all looked like they...  I don't know.  They walked in here quite normal.  Sure.  I'll do a little check if you like.  Would you?  Yeah.  Jimmy?  You approved that case?  I think they're going to be walking out of here a little differently.  A little different?  You never know.  We'll have to wait and see.  Well, because we're going to have a winner and some losers.  That's why they're going to win.  Let's go.  Yeah, definitely.  What?  Let's go.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, Phil.  What's up, gentlemen?  You're on the radio, bro.  What's up?  I just got wowed.  Oh, my God.  You should have saw this set of cans.  Where were you, Petunia? 
[03:15:00]  I-95.  Go to Delaware.  In the Philly area, right?  Yes, sir.  Well, there you go.  I tell him.  Hey, see?  Wow, it works.  Thanks, Phil.  Norton, when are you going to get funny?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You go to one of those shows, my friend.  I will.  Thank you, Phil.  Thanks, gentlemen.  I'll laugh your ass off.  Ronnie, did someone drop water on the board last night?  Yeah.  Is that why the phones weren't working?  A screeching out dukes.  That's why the phone. 
[03:15:30]  You effed up the place for us.  Why did he freak out this time?  Something about a gay thing.  Some gay thing.  Some gay thing that he was caught up with.  A gay guy wanted to fight him and accused him of a couple of things.  But I don't think it touched the phones.  No?  No.  But the board did start sparking and smoke came out of it.  Just like Al.  What's going on with him and our own Stalker Patty?  They're going to date tomorrow night.  They are dating.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty is a 45-year-old virgin from our program. 
[03:16:00]  Going on a date with one of the guys from Ranafez's show.  And this guy is, I don't even know how to describe him to our listeners.  Complete tool.  Complete tool.  He, I think, there's some gay thing going on there.  He had sex.  The first time he had sex, he lost it all over a chick's sweater.  He made it as far as his sweatshirt.  The sweatshirt.  And he just lost it all over her sweatshirt.  And we told Patty to look out for that.  And she said, I don't have many assets.  So I don't know what she means by that. 
[03:16:30]  I don't even know what she means by that.  We don't know what she means.  I'm thrilled to find out how that date is going to go.  So please keep us informed.  Well, they're going uptown.  Any action?  Cotton Club in Harlem.  Are they?  Yeah.  It's going to be a nice step out night.  You think any action?  Yeah, I think it'll happen.  You think there's going to be some effing going on?  It'll be.  Is Al attracted to Patty in some weird way?  Yeah, I think he is.  I think he digs her like a brother.  Yeah.  Well, if you're gay.  Well, that's good if you're Al.  But you have to be with a woman.  Patty's pretty much it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  That's like the manliest thing you can get.  Is he gay or is it just the haircut?  Because he looks like a Roman nickel.  It's the Caesar.  It's not in anymore.  The whole George Clooney thing is over.  It's done.  The Roman nickel.  Nice.  Maybe we're going to send it to the people of Rome.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up?  My two favorite crackers.  What up, kid?  What up?  What's going on, baby?  Yo, are there any ebony princesses in there today?  No, unfortunately. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, man.  Not yet.  So far, we got like four blondes and one brunette.  Ah, man.  Ain't no real booty up there.  Real booty?  No, not yet.  Yeah, I'm saying.  We got one coming?  There is one who's having her ID faxed over.  Oh, faxed over.  Nah, it's fake.  Is she the girl that we put stickers on and then marched around Times Square?  No.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's kind of hot.  Oh, boy.  She's not hot.  Look at this face.  Yo, is it her welfare ID?  Rick, Rick, don't say a word.  Just make a face. 
[03:18:00]  Oh.  Oh, okay.  She's a five.  Oh, jeez.  Mike, she's a five.  On a good day.  Oh, my God.  Which is a ten in the African-American world.  No, you got to check the booty out first.  All right, bro.  Check out the booty.  See, we just didn't want anyone having an advantage where they have to smuggle in contraband  to certain penal colonies or anything like that.  We don't want anybody with an advantage like that.  No.  Anthony, everyone knows we're doing the 2002 Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball Game.  It's Saturday, June 1st at Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears. 
[03:18:30]  Anthony, a few other things that will be going on during the softball game.  We got Frenchie's dunking booth.  There may be a twist as far as that goes.  There may be a really good trip involved with that.  And we announced yesterday that instead of doing it on the radio for just us, we're going  to shave Stalker Patty's hair in the middle of the game.  Right there on the big Jumbotron.  We're going to march her out to the mound, and we're going to get one of those Marine guys,  and we're going to put her big mug on the Jumbotron and take care of business.  That big chemo hairstyle coming back for Patty. 
[03:19:00]  Nice and cool for the summer.  That'll be nice.  Keep her cool.  That's good.  We might give her like a sack or something, and she could pathetically walk around the  stadium trying to collect more money.  Oh.  Or you could just put her in the sack and then put a brick on it and throw it in the river.  Do you know she is participating in this today?  So she is going to have to be.  Is she here yet?  Yeah.  She's going to have to be completely naked walking around.  It's going to look like, I swear, like one of those goddamn World War II movies. 
[03:19:30]  Maybe you could ride her around the studio in a bicycle basket.  What was that movie with, who was it, Vanessa Redgrave?  Playing for Time.  Playing for Time.  Remember the end of Playing for Time?  Where they all took their clothes off, put it in a big pile, walked into the room.  Let's get one shot of her in front of barbed wire just looking through.  We stick her on a freight train.  She's just peeking out.  Just peeking through the slats.  I'm essential to the war effort.  No, you're not, you one-armed shoveler. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  We're having a good time.  I go to probation in Newark every week.  Okay.  The only new thing about Newark is which homeless guy is laying down on the ground in front of  the stadium with a bottle of empty liquor in his mouth.  No.  The stadium is beautiful.  The stadium is beautiful.  The stadium's good.  What do you want probation for?  I wear long sleeves.  Today I have to go.  I'm wearing long sleeves in this heat because I don't want anyone to know I'm white when I'm 
[03:20:30]  down there.  And, Jay, your other line would have worked much better.  It says on the screen, only new thing in Newark is where you get robbed.  See?  It's not.  It's actually nice there during the daytime.  Right.  What time the Moorlach's coming out there?  That's in the daytime.  It looks like nighttime down there.  All right, Jay, stop.  The Moorlach's coming out there.  It's just one of those cities at a very night of the living, Dandy-ish, where everything's  fine and dandy.  You can walk down the street.  Everything's fine.  Then when you see the sun going down, you're like, uh-oh. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, Isaac Hayes is driving through.  Where's Brain?  By the way, Teddy got your casino reference, Norton.  Thank you.  Yeah.  If you're wondering.  It's nice.  Okay, good.  Things are happening.  We better take a break.  We're doing the O&A Money Snatch game.  Oh, looking forward to when this starts.  Okay.  Right.  We'll talk to more of the contestants next.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com. 
[03:21:30]  O.B. and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show just minutes away from the O.A. Money Snatch  game.  They are throwing dollar bills all over the studio.  We're here in the vault.  The O.A. vault.  It's the vault.  It's a remote broadcast now, Anthony.  And the money now being thrown all over the floor. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  We're in a good mood today, so we decided to put an extra $500 down, Anthony.  Yeah.  What the hell?  There's a total of $1,500 all over the studio.  About $300 to $400 hanging from the ceiling.  Got another couple hundred just plastered on the walls and the CD rack.  And then, I don't know, at least $500, $600 on the ground.  Make sure they're not, you know, piling up. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  Get them all separated.  Nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And here's one lucky dollar bill.  It's kind of a booby prize, Anthony.  Booby prize?  Well, you mean like a bonus prize.  Booby prize is bad.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  It's a bonus.  It's a bonus.  One of the dollar bills is marked with K and R.  Right.  The lucky lady that finds that dollar bill during this whole mess will get, on top of the money she collects,  front row tickets to see Kid Rock at the Garden Friday night.  Kid Rock.  So there you have it. 
[03:23:00]  You want to explain the O&A money snatch thing, just in case.  All right.  We may even be in a new city today.  I don't know.  How many girls we got?  I think we have what?  A total of ten ladies.  Ten ladies.  All completely naked.  Yeah, Rick goes, all right, ladies, it's time to get naked.  And they were not shy.  Yeah.  One of them got the big panties on there.  They're like their training diapers.  What are you doing?  Oh, Jesus.  It's annoying.  Get those huge drawers off.  One girl's panties look like a used shoeshine rag. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, God, no.  Wow, somebody scare you?  Can I ask a question?  Is Stalker Patty naked out there?  Unfortunately, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Completely naked.  Bring her in.  Awful.  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, God, this is going to be awful.  Bring in the gimp.  All I can see is Sandy's face looking like this.  All the girls are naked outside the studio.  They're going to be in here in a few minutes. 
[03:24:00]  Stinky just spreading dollars all over the place.  Yay.  Oh, she's still got her panties on.  Still got her panties on.  You sure?  How can you tell?  Hey, kiddie.  I thought that was her grooming habit.  What?  Patty, why don't you get on mic, you ass?  Patty, can I ask you something?  I have to keep my surgical shoe on because of medical reasons.  Other than that, I don't have to have anything else on.  Patty, we have Edith Bunker doing the O&A Money Snatch today. 
[03:24:30]  You look like you're covering up.  You're very shy.  Don't you understand?  You're going to need your hands to do this.  Hey, Patty, don't cover up.  Don't worry.  No one's looking.  Okay.  Now, why do you still have your huge, huge panties on?  Yeah, they're not huge.  They are huge.  What are you doing?  Wear a little bikini number.  That's like huge panties.  They're awful.  It'd be sexier if you wore Fruit of the Looms.  Oh, stop.  I think Andre the Giant wore those when he was wrestling.  So now, Patty, why do you still have your panties on? 
[03:25:00]  Don't worry.  They'll come off.  No, no.  I am not worried.  Let's get this straight.  They will come off when it's time for me to.  Oh, I can't wait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Ben, why don't you talk to Patty now like you were talking during the commercials?  Just a silch, Patty.  Just go die.  I really can't take her.  She's such a frigging loser.  Look at her feet.  Oh, God.  Well, I have one good foot. 
[03:25:30]  You know the greatest thing about Patty, too?  Do you notice every time she comes in here, she can't use a microphone.  She talks Patty.  Hey, yo, yeah.  I really talk over here like this.  Hey, yo, yeah.  Dude, I hate her.  Very funny.  Hey, we forgot to tell the listeners about another twist we added to the contest today.  Oh, yeah.  Be careful with this because we don't want to blow them all into one corner.  Yeah, we got a leaf blower.  We got a leaf blower.  What we were going to do was cram it into their balloon knot and blow their brain down.  Fire it up a little.  Is the leaf blower going to work? 
[03:26:00]  All right.  All right, good.  The leaf blower's working.  Now, Rick, you got to run around with the leaf blower.  All right.  Yeah, maybe we could play some aha songs.  All right, Patty's naked.  Patty, ugh.  Okay.  Except for the bloomers.  Now they're all over here.  That's okay.  It's all right.  They were over there and now they're over here.  It's all over here.  One's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  Yeah.  Eight dogs in the middle.  Anthony.  Yeah.  It's time to explain the O&A Money Snatch game.  Right.  And we have to announce that this is the first time this is being done on radio. 
[03:26:30]  Unfortunately, we got to do this now because you'll start seeing people doing this, you  know, but remember, hey, we're doing the cash gash.  It's the dash for cash.  Gash.  Norton has some dollar bills all over his body.  Yeah, he's taping them to his groin.  Why not?  Well, we got ten girls, right?  Totally nude.  Yeah, they're completely nude outside.  Here in the bank vault, we're calling it, money hanging from the ceilings, from the floor, 
[03:27:00]  about $1,500 in total.  And what they have to do is gather up this money.  You've heard of things similar to this before.  You gather up the money and whoever has the most money at the end of the time period gets  to keep not only the money they collected, but all the money on the floor.  Now, there's a twist to this whole thing.  There's a twist.  We haven't really come out and said it to the listening audience. 
[03:27:30]  We have told the girls about this twist, this strange twist to this game.  It has to do with, well, when the time period ends, how much money they have on their person.  Let's just put it that way.  There are certain places they cannot have money.  That's right.  Oh, good.  They cannot have money in their hands.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Sure.  You good with that?  That doesn't give much away.  No, it doesn't.  Okay.  Are they going to be dressed?  Well, when the time ends. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  Whatever money is in their hands.  They have to drop.  They have to drop.  Okay.  They can't hold it.  Very good.  But there are other places that they cannot have money, which we won't get into.  But that is part of the twist.  And I'm just looking at ten girls.  Completely naked, lined up to come into the money vault.  So great.  Well, I'm a little, not all of them are naked.  They'll get naked.  They've got to get naked.  Those are the shy ones, eh?  I know.  They're beautiful.  They're beautiful.  The best piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  Continue it.  Yeah.  At the end of this, the one that collects the most money will win the money she collected  and all the money that's left on the floor.  That's left.  And all the other girls will go home with the money they did collect.  With the money they collected.  There was one special bill on the floor that if one of the girls get it, they will get front  row tickets to Kid Rock.  Right.  And we upped the ante.  There's $1,500 all over the place now.  $1,500.  What is the time period that we have agreed upon? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  You know what, though?  What?  I'm ready to go.  Is it too late to get in on this?  Oh, Fez from the Ron and Fez show right after our show.  Ron and Fez come on here in New York.  Is it too late?  Well, Fez, we really, yeah.  Really?  It's too late.  Fez, put your clothes back on.  You're making everyone very uncomfortable.  Please put your clothes back on.  I play a version of this with the neighborhood kids.  It's called Bun Bucks.  Yeah.  We play it Saturday morning.  Oh, do you? 
[03:29:30]  Fez, please put your clothes back on.  Sounds captivating.  Yeah, I'm sorry, Fez.  You know something?  If you would have called us earlier, but we're ready to go.  I'm already rat-holing a sack of quarters.  I'm more than ready.  Rat-holing.  Fine.  I'll get in line.  If you change your mind, let me know.  All right, Fez.  You wait, and you'll be on Ready 5 like Maverick was.  Oh, Fez?  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  Wait, Fez? 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Damn!  Damn him!  Damn him to hell!  God damn, is that the best gag ever?  So we explained the whole damn thing.  We got $15,000.  Everything was explained.  I'm thinking we have to go more than five minutes because of something you were discussing.  How they're going to like, huh?  A strategy.  And then...  All right.  I'm having a lot more confidence in the girls, though.  Because then, Ante will be, you know...  What if... 
[03:30:30]  There's going to be none left in the...  What if nothing...  What if it runs out?  What if they run out of money?  You will.  Not...  Nope.  Nope.  I will make a side bet.  Who wants to bet?  All right.  There will be money left on the floor.  Okay.  Guaranteed.  I bet $25.  And that's what I'm getting at.  They could...  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And see...  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I see your hand motions.  Yes.  Exactly what you're talking about.  Right.  How is that cramming motion? 
[03:31:00]  And they might have to...  Yeah.  Okay.  So you're thinking some time is going to have to be spent doing that.  Ah.  So how much time would you allot?  Not much.  I mean, we started five.  What do you want to go?  Eight.  Seven or eight?  Seven.  Seven.  Seven.  How about lucky seven?  Lucky seven.  The girls will have seven minutes.  Seven minutes.  Huh?  To collect.  Yeah.  Seven minutes.  All right.  Opie, why don't we go to our wireless mics?  Oh, hold on.  We got Lisa that wants to kick off... 
[03:31:30]  Oh, what?  What?  What?  What?  Wow.  No, I'm just looking at the clock and going, you are good.  You are good.  He's ready to take a goddamn phone call.  He's ready to take a goddamn phone call.  You know what, though?  No one's going to be disappointed.  You are the consummate professional.  That's why I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I was passed over.  He's not dumb like everyone says.  He's smart.  Smart.  By the way, it's going to be 522.  Lisa.  Hello.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Virginia.  And how old are you?  I'm 17. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Do we have our chart?  Hey, I don't care.  Do we have our chart the lawyers gave us?  You're doing nothing.  Because it's different in every state.  Not in Virginia.  It's 10.  Please.  Let's be real here.  She's twice divorced.  Oh, man.  Hey, Lisa, what's the legal age in Virginia?  Last time I checked, it was, what is it, 12?  12.  Can someone help us?  What's the age?  To do a phone call is nothing. 
[03:32:30]  No, you know what she's going to do.  Well, she's going to fake something.  She's going to fake.  All right, Lisa wants to do the fake orgasm for today, the 5 o'clock fake-o.  Can I get a hello from Norton, Queen?  Of course you can.  Hello, Lisa.  Oh, he'll give you a lot more than that if you like.  Wow.  Yeah, I'll knock 30 or 40 years off your life.  I'm Lisa?  Yeah.  All right, Lisa.  Norton's not the cute one.  I am.  Oh, my God.  How do you know?  Well, look at him.  I'm the single one.  He's the guy that gets all the chicks. 
[03:33:00]  Well, look, you got a girl.  He's got a girl.  Rick's got a girl.  And Ben's got a girl.  Oh, my God.  Detail, stop.  Everyone's got a girl.  Yeah, you kind of luck out there, don't you?  Yeah, I got nothing.  Well, Lisa.  What about Awesome Garrett?  You know what?  I apologize.  You're right.  Myself and Awesome Garrett are the only two who read all the time and don't have them.  All right.  Therefore, we have to help each other.  Let's get to Lisa.  Lisa, you know how we like this, right?  Yes.  It's got to start slow, build to a crescendo, and then taper off.  Don't just end it at the pinnacle. 
[03:33:30]  Okay, I sure won't.  All right.  Lisa, let her rip.  Right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little lower.  Right there.  Don't like directions.  I like directions.  No directions.  Oh, you're so big. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, yeah. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  Lisa.  The only thing that could have made that better is if she would have said, Jim, I can't believe 
[03:35:00]  you're 16 years older.  Oh, stop it.  Stop, Jim.  You.  It's not about you.  I know that.  Jim, I'm up to give you a hummer at any time, just so you know.  Oh, my God.  Just so you know.  And that's really nice, Tinkledrinker at AOL.com, of you to say, but I couldn't accept that  because, not that I'd want you to email me.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa.  Don't email me at Silly Goose.  We'll see you Friday.  We're coming to DC.  You'll be there Friday, Hope.  All right.  There's Tinkledrinker.  Oh, my God.  AOL.com. 
[03:35:30]  You betcha.  The appropriate authority.  She should be there.  Oh, my dude.  I can't.  That was hot.  Who's your best friend now?  See?  Who wanted to go to the phone?  G-H.  Well.  Huh?  Huh?  What?  Who?  G-H.  G-H.  Very good.  Wow, G-H.  That's right, J-N.  That actually gave me a three-quarter rod.  Did it work for you?  I don't mind directions when it's like that.  If it's nice.  I don't like a little lower.  I don't like.  Why?  She's telling you what she wants.  No.  That's fine.  We hate directions.  I don't mind.  No directions.  I'll get there.  If I have to take the back roads, I'll get there.  Directions imply you're doing something wrong. 
[03:36:00]  Not necessarily.  Yes, they do.  Angel eyes.  Because you happen to be big enough to hit every single inch of the area.  Maybe some of us are not.  Jim, we've been discussing you in the back office.  You make us very uncomfortable when you call us angel eyes and stuff.  I know, but it's just all, you know.  I prefer sweetie pie.  Yeah.  All right.  It doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong when they ask for directions.  Anthony, when we get back, we do the O&A money snatch game.  Wait, did you hear that?  What?  People screaming, F-U-O-P.  No, we just came. 
[03:36:30]  I hear it outside on the streets.  B.S., we just gave them the best fake O ever.  Don't matter.  Oh, they'll remember that.  All right.  And the fake O is finally back.  It took a little break there, didn't it?  That was very good.  She did a great job.  All right.  You're not going to believe what's next.  Stay there.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  O.B. and Anthony.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:37:00]  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I love this song, but I don't know.  The band picked a name that's hard to pronounce.  Yeah.  I think it's Kowashi.  What?  Kowashi.  All right.  Fine.  You say it then.  I just know the song rocks.  Stick them up.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, you know, Ian, I was thinking of maybe playing a Brian Regan bit here.  Dude, I'm going to smack you.  I'm going to, for the sake of the listeners, reach over and slap you in the face. 
[03:37:30]  But Rich has something to say.  Yes, Rich?  Yeah, what's up, O'Neill?  Hey.  Hey, man, after that fake O, I feel like I violated that girl.  I want to drive myself directly to jail.  You know something?  You're right.  Let's go on record and say that was probably the best fake O we've had on our show.  Yep.  There was something else about eatabullet.com.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  I challenge the ladies to try to beat the girl that did the fake O today.  Everything I'm reading is just, oh, my God, the best one ever. 
[03:38:00]  My mule is plump.  I don't know what that even means.  My mule is plump.  How you doing, baby?  And she's from Virginia, Anthony.  Virginia.  And we're going to be in Virginia Friday.  Should we tell everyone about that?  Yeah.  Why not?  No, but instead.  You bastard.  We've got to say hi to Jim Cook, our buddy, our pal from Sam Adams.  Jim, how are you?  I'm great, but I brought beer.  Yes, even better.  And you brought naked ladies?  This is a partnership. 
[03:38:30]  You know something, Jim?  You always show up on some of the best days we have.  He must have a nice smell.  What?  He knows how to smell things out.  Oh, sense of smell.  Sense of smell.  I thought maybe you were going over, hey, Jim, what kind of cologne you wearing?  Oh, he's got a good nose for things.  Yeah, it smells like hops.  I put a little lager behind each ear.  You don't see Jim Cook showing up when we're having one of those crappy shows?  No, only the good ones.  He's like Jamaican Mike.  He only shows up during the good show.  He can smell when we're doing a good show.  You've got money taped to your zipper, too. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, you want to tape some money to your crotch there, Jim?  It could be the difference between first and second place today.  Bravo.  Jim, you brought some fine Sam Adams with you.  I brought you a new beer, man.  Yes.  This is not even legal in New York until Monday.  Why is that?  Because we haven't got all the permits, so enjoy some illegal beer.  Not that you've ever done anything illegal.  Oh, really?  You need some kind of permit to have that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How much to run?  400 cases. 
[03:39:30]  A lot.  Eastbound and down, loaded up in trucking.  Full smoke in the bandit there.  Would you like a beer?  No, thank you, Angel Face.  You know something?  He's one of the people that couldn't handle the beer during his life, so he had to stop drinking.  I tripped and my wrists hit razors.  Stop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's all right.  You inhaled what was left on the carpet, and you were just fine.  He's moved on to homicide, things like that.  Just don't lick his head. 
[03:40:00]  He doesn't like that.  I don't like having my head licked.  No.  Which head?  Exactly.  That is a very important question.  Isn't it?  Big distinction between no and here's 50.  If only Tom from New Orleans would have asked that question.  Maybe he'd still have a job.  Hey, Anthony.  Bob wants to say something really fast.  Yeah?  Go ahead, Bob.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, what's the chance of kicking this show off before 6 o'clock?  I got school, man.  I hate to miss this thing.  People are so pissed.  No, we're going to do it right now.  Come on, you're killing me.  All right, Jim, you're going to help us out with this, right?  It's the ONA Money Snatch game. 
[03:40:30]  Don't tell me.  You're not really going to do what I think you're going to do.  Jim, how solid is your prenup?  Is it good?  You're going to need it.  It's going to get hot.  This could cost me a lot of money, man.  We got video equipment all over the place.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  As long as they don't do anything with the empty beer bottles.  We have to take these back.  You got to take them back.  We refill them, man.  I don't remember putting so much yeast in the brew. 
[03:41:00]  This tastes a little gamey.  Well, we're in the ONA Money Vault.  What we're going to do now, I am going to move.  Opie's moving to the remote mic.  I'm going to move to the mic that Jim is using.  I'm going to get up on the console,  and I'll have a good view of everything that's going on.  Because, you know, I have to help out conveying to our listening audience  what is going on.  A very detailed description of what is going on on this program. 
[03:41:30]  And that's my job.  I make the sacrifices.  I can't just sit and gawk and ooh and ah.  I am here to share.  Anthony, will you shut up and get over here?  I was waiting for you.  All right.  Okay.  I'm in position.  Grab my sand.  I'm above the money pit, Anthony.  Let me get high above the money pit.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  We have a lot of money on the floor.  Shut up.  We got about $1,500 all over the money vault. 
[03:42:00]  He says relax, Rick.  We have a couple hundred dollar bills hanging from the ceiling.  It's on the walls.  It's on the floor.  Hey, Jim, you want to throw some dollar bills on the ground?  Sure.  I see a couple 20s down there, Anthony, to make it interesting.  When you get a nickel deposit with every Sam Adams.  I see a 20 and a 10 right now.  I see a few 20s, a few 5s, a few 10s.  Mostly ones, though.  Mostly ones.  And one of the $1 bills has the initials KR on the back.  The lucky girl that... 
[03:42:30]  For Cramden.  That picks that one up.  We'll go to Kid Rock and sit in the front row at the Garden Friday here in New York City.  Ain't that funny?  Cramden.  Cramden.  By the way, someone from Philly was asking if we're going to the Kid Rock show after our  show tomorrow in Philly.  And, yes, we will be at the Kid Rock show tomorrow night.  Hey, Ralph, you seem like a couple of those bills been down there in the sewer.  Here, Ant, move over here.  I'm perfect.  You're perfect? 
[03:43:00]  I have a great view.  I just got to turn some of these lights.  They're burning me.  Ow!  I feel like I'm getting interrogated.  I just lost my microphone.  What happened?  Hey.  You sat on the button.  Jesus.  Oh, I sat on the button?  All right.  It's a tough one.  Rick, are you going to announce the girls as they walk into the Money Vault completely  naked?  Yes, I am.  And do we have a stopwatch?  A clock?  Some kind of timing device.  A clock, did you say?  Oh, we all...  A clock.  We all carry our own clocks.  Okay.  I got my clock.  Get a clock rubbed on your face. 
[03:43:30]  Jimmy, suck my clock.  Could you please?  Oh, cut it out.  Rib, rib, jab, jab.  All right.  The lady's going to make a separate entrance, each and every one.  Can we make comments?  This is great.  As they walk in naked?  As they line up by the CDs.  Okay.  Who do we have first, Rick?  All right.  First up, we have Shannon.  Let's hear it for Shannon.  Shannon.  Wow.  A lovely, lovely blonde.  Very nice. 
[03:44:00]  Just go in the corner over there.  That is wonderful.  Beautiful.  Very nice.  She's got the tongue ring.  You want to say something?  No, no, because all the girls are going to line up.  We're going to stick all the girls.  That is a very nice style she's got there.  I like the style.  By the way, that's good because it's not completely devoid of anything, yet it's manageable.  Ant, you blew my bit.  What?  I said we're going to stick all the girls in the corner.  What? 
[03:44:30]  What?  Wow.  You want to follow that with a casino reference?  Someone out there got it.  Shut up.  Go ahead, Rick.  All right.  Contestant number two.  Let's hear it for Jewel.  Jewel.  Yeah.  Come on in here.  Wow.  Look at Jewel.  All right.  Back into the next to the corner.  Next to the corner.  Jewel was practicing last night.  And she said she did pretty good.  Yes.  We don't have a mic for the girls.  Somebody like a stinky or anything with a mic that could go over to the girls.  Well, they could come here.  That's great.  Jewel, you want to say something? 
[03:45:00]  I want to win.  Oh, she wants to win.  Well, there she goes.  Okay.  And she is completely barren.  I think she's our shortest contestant, too.  Yes.  What are you, 5'1"?  Almost 5'2"?  Almost 5'1".  Almost 5'1".  Rick, who's next?  All right.  Up next, contestant number three, KC.  KC.  KC.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Hi.  Hi.  She just says hi.  We have a little problem with Patty. 
[03:45:30]  What's the problem with Patty?  What are you guys, unionize out there?  Patty's getting $906 for shaving her head.  Why is she in it?  Hey, yeah.  And plus the fact she's not totally naked because she's got the cast on her foot.  Hey.  Well, you know something?  They've been having a mutiny outside the studio.  They don't want Patty and the ONA money.  Plus the fact, you just don't want to see Patty naked.  Well.  They're absolutely different things, though.  Oh, Jesus.  Well.  You know what?  What do you think, Opie?  I think she has a point.  She does have a point.  What do you think?  Patty out? 
[03:46:00]  She's shaving her head.  Patty's out.  Patty's out.  Patty's out.  Calling her over.  Patty's out.  All right, Patty.  Put your clothes.  Patty, you are out.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  Patty, put your goddamn clothes back on.  We don't want to wreck the experience for the other ladies.  Patty's got to put her clothes back on in.  Come on.  You're burning out retinas.  Go.  All right.  Rick, who's next?  If I turn it on, I'm going to puke.  Rick, who's next?  All right.  You know it's a good show, first of all.  Number four is no.  When Super Agent Bob Eatman shows up in the back, I see. 
[03:46:30]  Hello.  Why is our agent here?  Why do you think?  Hi.  How are you?  I'm good.  Very good.  And you're confident in your performance here?  Yes.  I left my Yankee attitude at home yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Oh, that was you.  Oh, you seem very nice in person.  Thank you.  And she's a Yankee fan.  Yes.  A very, very, very hardcore Yankee fan because who else would tattoo a Yankee logo?  I was trying to figure out how you could tell.  What?  When you said she's a Yankee fan, I'm looking at everything, trying to figure it out. 
[03:47:00]  And then I noticed a tattoo.  Yes.  Because they don't have clothes on?  Sorry.  That's okay.  Born and raised.  There you go.  And another one just completely devoid of any foliage of stuff.  Just say.  I don't know if that'll help in some kind of strategy.  Rick, who's next?  All right.  Up next is Colleen.  Colleen.  Colleen, come on in.  What's up, Colleen?  What's up?  How you doing?  I think she was the loud one.  You were the loud one, right?  You've been loud?  I was loud, Mal. 
[03:47:30]  Really?  We've been trying to do a radio show, and we hear you just yelling and screaming out there.  You know what?  You tell us to get drunk and, you know, hang out and sing.  We did?  Hang out and stick the stairwell before we come and hang out and hang out and hang out.  All?  All?  She was yelling in your ear?  Yeah.  She was yelling in your ear?  But you enjoyed it.  But you enjoyed it.  In your ear?  We have no problems with you.  Okay.  She yelled right in your ear.  But she enjoyed it, too.  Okay.  All right.  We got five girls in the street.  That's great.  Yeah.  How many more are left, Rick?  Four?  We got five.  Four more.  Four more.  Okay.  Because Patty's out. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Up next is number six, Helena.  Helena.  Helena.  Helena.  Here she goes.  Yeah.  I remember.  Yeah.  I remember Helena.  Yes.  She's done stuff for us before, Anthony.  Yes, I did.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hello.  Good to see you again.  Good.  Good.  Nice.  Hi.  And you have not done anything.  Oh, no.  I'm just saying that it's very natural.  I like the natural look, Opie.  Thank you.  Very good.  And she put on some lipstick for the occasion.  Yeah, baby. 
[03:48:30]  Mm-hmm.  Child.  Very nice.  Oh, she's pushing the mic away.  All right.  All right.  Who's next?  All right.  Next, number seven, Maria.  Maria.  Come on in.  Oh, look at the tattoo around the belly button.  Very nice.  She's got a piercing right there.  Right there.  You're viewing pleasure.  Very nice.  And might I say, clean as a whistle.  And it looks completely powdered and everything.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Bravo. 
[03:49:00]  Very nice.  We got a contestant.  Number eight now is Robin.  Robin.  Robin.  How are you?  Oh, she's our tallest contestant.  Six-one, Anthony.  Again, clean as a whistle.  Very good.  Anyone embarrassed or shy here?  No.  No?  Very good.  Oof.  Very good.  Look at all the nudity we have here in the studio today.  How we figured this out, Opie, I will never, ever know.  And last but not least, guys, Amber. 
[03:49:30]  Amber.  There you go.  Amber making her way in.  Oh, she's got a little lower back tat going there.  Spin around.  Let's see that thing.  She's got lots of things going on.  Very nice.  Very nice, Amber.  Very nice.  And, again, very clean.  Let's just say, very clean.  We have a lot of clean as a whistle.  We have to maintain.  A lot of clean contestants.  Maintain.  Very good.  Very lovely.  So all the girls are in the...  All the contestants are here.  I am going to pull my leg up here because I think it's just going to be a frenzy.  Lowenstein.  This is going to be insanity. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, I'm going way up.  Girls, some of the rules.  No yelling out of anything you're doing.  You know what I mean?  You could, you know, hoot and holler with joy.  But no yelling of any details on what's going on.  All right?  And the time limit?  Seven minutes.  So we're going to start the clock.  You guys will start picking up money.  There's various strategies you can use.  That's up to you.  The bottom line, after seven minutes, you'll hear the bell ring. 
[03:50:30]  Time will be over.  You will drop whatever money is in your hands.  And you must have on your person all of the money that you have collected.  Because that's exactly the amount that you will be accounted for.  You can't have it in your hands.  And you can't say, okay, now I'm going to do with it what has to be done with it.  It has to already be done.  Signed, sealed, delivered. 
[03:51:00]  Throw your hands up.  Time done.  And the girl that collects the most money will get the remaining money on the floor, the ceiling, and the walls.  Right.  And everyone goes home happy because you'll go home with what you collect.  I think we're ready, eh?  Just remember to have fun.  Jim, any last words over there?  You can't yell anything out at all.  Well, so if you have your member of the show puts his face in your balloon nut, you let it go.  And that face will be Jim Norton's, by the way.  If you don't want to spend time to turn around and look, just remember it's Jim Norton. 
[03:51:30]  And there's a lucky $100 bill somewhere on Jim Norton's person.  Would you stop it?  Disgusting.  Mr. Cook, nothing.  It looks like a stand-up.  Jim Cook.  Ladies, start your engines.  There you go.  And who's the official timekeeper?  And grab that.  Mr. Cook, could you just grab that little bell?  See that bell thing there?  There you go.  Pass it to Mr. Norton.  There we are.  Everybody gives it a quick little ring. 
[03:52:00]  Why not?  And yes, a question.  Yes.  Rick, go over there with the microphone, please.  There you go.  Oh, Jamaican Mike's junk was on the mic cord.  Are we going to have, like, a one-minute warning when we're down to, like, a minute?  That's a goddamn good idea.  Good idea.  Look at that.  I am a genius.  Hey, Craig.  You are.  Craig, if they're giving away the twist down the hall, you could dump out, by the way.  I don't know what you...  Did you just say something about something?  No.  No.  She goes, can we have a...  I wasn't sure.  A one-minute warning.  Okay.  I wasn't sure exactly what she said. 
[03:52:30]  She didn't say a one-minute effing warning or nothing.  All right.  I don't know.  You have to ask...  Oh, there's a question here.  Another question.  Rick, Rick, put the mic on.  Everything...  Just put it this way.  I know what she just asked.  Everything you need to do has to be done in seven minutes.  Everything.  There's no after seven minutes going, okay, now I will prepare things or do things.  Everything has to be done.  Yeah, so that's why we'll be shouting out how much time you got left.  Okay.  So you can figure it out.  We'll give a minute-by-minute thing. 
[03:53:00]  Okay.  Here's the bell.  Who's the timekeeper?  I am Ben.  All right.  When seven minutes are up, Ben, just pound that thing.  By the way, this is on the Stinky Cam, Anthony.  Oh, wait, ladies, ladies.  Stop it.  All right, are we ready?  Be kind to each other?  Look at these girls.  No, he says, don't be kind.  Oh, okay.  Ladies, let me pull my leg up there.  There you go, because it's like being in a water with piranha.  Look out, just in case we need it.  You are listening to the O&A Money Snatch Game. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, that's right.  Rick has the leaf blower.  The leaf blower.  It's going to make it a little more interesting.  This is fantastic.  Let us know when we come around the clock.  Clock.  And we're ready to go.  Give us maybe a 10-second countdown.  Yeah, someone count it down.  Ben?  Ten.  Nine.  Nine.  Ben?  Eight.  All right, here we go.  Seven.  Six.  Five.  Four.  Three.  Two.  One.  There we go.  Pick it up, you greedy horse.  And they're going.  They're going. 
[03:54:00]  Shut up.  They're going.  Oh, I see one strategy.  The big bills.  The giraffe is going for the roof.  The tall girl with a definite advantage.  Yeah, she's getting the money off the ceiling very easily, obviously.  Wow.  And they're just running around the studio right now, collecting as much as possible.  Yes, jump, jump, jump.  Right now, wow, they're grabbing at Jim Norton's crotch.  Nice.  Rick's bill on his pants.  Rick, blow some of the money around.  I do. 
[03:54:30]  There you go.  There he goes.  The leaf blower's on.  Tussle the hair with the leaf blower there, Rick.  Anthony, you notice tussle.  Anthony, you notice all the girls are using the same strategy.  Yes.  Hey, no cursing.  Yeah, there's no cursing.  That's all right.  I don't think that got through.  I didn't hear that.  All right, no cursing, ladies.  Oh, we have money being played there by Pink Floyd, huh?  Wow.  A little wacky, wacky, wacky alert.  Hey, Rick, you better work the leaf blower because they're collecting the money way too fast.  I know.  I told you.  See? 
[03:55:00]  We knew.  We knew.  Let it fly.  Let it fly.  All the girls with the same strategy, they have decided to gather, to just gather it first.  More, Rick.  Go over there.  Start blowing.  Get right in the mix, Rick.  Blow that pile away.  There you go.  There you go.  See, that's the strategy, Rick.  The girls are getting all pissed off.  Rick's blowing the money all over the studio.  There we go, Rick.  Whoa, hey.  Beat her with the thing, Rick.  Beat her with it.  There we go.  That's how to dwork that blower, Rick. 
[03:55:30]  No, not like that, Rick.  Rick, Rick, get that pile.  Rick is, well.  Hey, lady from the tub in the shining, you can't curse.  Hey, Ben, how many minutes?  We're two minutes into the competition, Anthony.  All right.  Two minutes into the competition.  The girls are collecting the money.  They're pulling it off the ceiling.  They're pulling it off the walls.  Oh, God.  Wow, the sight I just saw.  Oh, my God.  The sight I just saw. 
[03:56:00]  Wow.  Hey.  That was really nice.  There's something you don't see every day.  Wow.  Now, Opie, I am seeing.  I'm sorry.  I really got a good look.  What's that girl's name there?  The blonde?  The blonde with the tongue ring is what I'm calling her.  Yeah.  She is collecting a lot of money.  But the second phase of this may cause her problems.  Yeah, reality's going to set in there.  Oh, she got it.  All right.  She says she has that underhand.  You know what?  Jewel, who practiced last night, Anthony.  Yeah.  She's got a technique a lot different than the other girls. 
[03:56:30]  She's making sure that the pile of money she collects is very organized.  Organized in a neat pile.  How about that?  How about that?  You know something?  With the twist in this thing, Opie, some of the girls that actually collect the most money  won't win because they won't be able to do the twist.  That's right.  So there's kind of a strategy here where you've got to say, when do I stop collecting?  When do I start trying to organize and get this the way it's supposed to be?  How many minutes in are we?  A little over three. 
[03:57:00]  Ladies, we are half over with the competition.  Halfway through.  Halfway through.  So you might want to start thinking about the twist.  Opie, only a couple of bills left on the floor.  The ceiling now being stripped clean of dollars.  There they go.  Rick trying his best with the leaf blower.  Wow.  Rick is trying to blow the money out of their hands.  Naked girls are kicking Rick.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I like when Rick uses the blower to goose them. 
[03:57:30]  He's using the leaf blower to goose them.  Interesting.  All right.  This one girl looks like she's going to cry.  Oh, my God.  All right, Rick.  They're going to kick your ass.  Rick, don't be crazy with it.  Ladies, we're talking only about three minutes left of the competition.  Just about all the money is collected.  Now, I think.  Oh, one girl is in the corner starting the twist, Anthony.  Oh, okay.  Tongue ring girl is starting to work the twist.  I don't know if she's going to have enough time to tell you the truth.  There's mere minutes left. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  And she's going to have to make a decision.  She has gathered up a lot of money.  But now, the twist, it's very easy to just grab money.  Now, oh, my goodness.  All right, look.  Holy jeez.  What the hell are you doing?  Look, do you honor?  You didn't even organize that money, did you?  No.  You've got to understand something.  That can't just be held like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You might want to.  Well, okay.  How about you go over there?  Use the floor.  You've got to use the floor.  You know what's funny, Ed?  All the girls are hiding in the corner to do the twist.  Right.  Go hide, ladies.  They're working together, and they're covering each other. 
[03:58:30]  Rick is still trying to blow the money out of their hands.  Do it right there.  No.  That would have been hysterical.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, Rick just blew the piles of money away.  All right, Rick.  Oh, my God.  Rick, you suck.  Rick, you suck.  They had a huge pile in the corner.  One of the girls had a big pile.  Oh, my.  Oh, they are so pissed off. 
[03:59:00]  They were all.  Two minutes.  Two-minute warning.  Two minutes.  Two-minute warning.  Rick, they were.  Anthony, they were all organized in nice piles, and Rick went between one of the girls' legs  and just blew the money everywhere.  You cannot use any thigh or anything.  This must absolutely be where it is.  Yep.  Ooh, that smell.  A minute and a half.  Can't you smell that?  Let's just say, what if the whole roll isn't disappeared? 
[03:59:30]  No, it doesn't.  No, no, no.  Okay, all right.  I'm just making sure.  Oh, Rick.  Rick is like Leatherface with his thing.  You know what's happening?  They have to make little piles as they roll up the money, and they gather it up in the right way.  Rick, no more leaf blower because they're running out of time, and they're getting really pissed off at you.  Tongue ring, girl.  You better hurry up.  One minute.  You're going to lose some of that money.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow!  Oh, my goodness. 
[04:00:00]  Okay, that's a wild technique right there.  Wow.  How much time, Ben?  50 seconds.  Hey, you might want to spit on that.  Anthony.  What?  We could add a minute onto the clock.  Yeah.  You want to do that?  We're going to add a minute onto the clock, ladies, but you've got less than two minutes.  Less than two minutes to go.  Don't do that.  You're dirtying the money.  Less than two minutes.  All right, huh?  Wait, wait.  You know what?  No, that's thigh.  Dude, that's thigh.  We can't have that.  Yeah, you've got to make sure. 
[04:00:30]  Don't say anything.  Don't say anything.  I've never seen a bunch of sadder dollar bills.  Wow, this girl's having a tough time.  The Washington is holding his nose.  You've just got to get it.  I will never use an ATM machine again, by the way.  At least get it past the serial numbers.  It's credit cards for me from now on.  Her little legs are shaking like Bambi.  Oh, my God.  How did that work for you?  All right, let's do it.  All right, well, sit down like that if you could or, you know, just. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, that's official.  All right, that's official.  That's official.  If you show it and I, it'll be official.  That's official right there.  You're holding it that way.  How much time, Ben?  45 seconds.  You've got to do a somersault and hold it there.  No, yours is official, so it's.  Go ahead.  Oh, no, no, don't say that.  Don't say that.  Don't say anything.  Should we give them one more minute, Anthony?  Well, whatever it takes, just let them, because they have it collected up in 30 seconds.  We'll give, ladies, we'll give you one last minute, okay? 
[04:01:30]  One last minute.  Ben, one more minute on the clock.  This girl is done.  Rick, you've got to pay.  No, Rick, stop.  You've got to pay attention.  This girl is done.  Yeah, make sure.  All right.  Bring her to the side.  Take that.  Yeah.  The judges have ruled you official.  She's official.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Stay there.  Is this girl official, too?  Hold your money.  Are you official?  Yes.  Yes, she's official.  Hold your money.  Right there, Rick.  Grab the girl with the tongue ring.  She's official.  You must be kidding.  No, you're official.  Yeah, that's official. 
[04:02:00]  Grab it.  Yes, yes.  All right.  Grab it.  Make sure you hold it.  Don't start counting yet.  Just hold it.  Hold it.  Don't count at all.  We're going to count on the air.  Don't worry.  I've got to rub the band.  Oh, you do.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, did we get these dollar bills from a bank robbery?  Oh, her dollars seem to look like it looks like the bank robbery when the red dye packet  goes off.  Oh, wow.  Are we having a – well, okay.  Make sure she's official.  This mess is official.  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Okay.  Very nice. 
[04:02:30]  All right.  Ladies, do not count the money.  We're going to do it live on the air.  Don't count.  Just grab, hold.  Don't pick up any more.  Are you official?  Rick, she's official right there.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Wow, there's a lot of money left over.  I would have won a bet, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Ten seconds.  Don't say anything.  She's just saying, you know, maybe a paper cut.  Five, four, three, two, one.  There's the bell.  All right.  All the girls are official.  There it is.  Everyone hold their money.  You've got to drop the money on the floor. 
[04:03:00]  No, no, no, no.  Just hold it in your hand.  All right.  Anthony.  All right.  Grab that money from – yeah, there.  You can now hold that in your hand.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That, yeah, you can –  Wow.  That really –  That was a lot of fun to watch movies.  All right.  All right.  Now, yeah, you –  You know what?  Don't say anything.  Don't stop.  Don't say anything.  Now, put the money in your hands.  Yeah, everyone put their money in their hands.  Just get the money –  Get the money in your hands.  Now, Anthony.  Yeah.  Look at the floor. 
[04:03:30]  There's got to be $300 at least.  Now, the interesting thing, Opie, all the money was picked up at one point.  Right.  All the money was actually picked up.  There was a very limited amount that they were able to get, but –  What?  All right.  Shh.  But the – yeah, there's a roll underneath the – that has to be kicked out.  Kick it out.  Kick that back out.  Not that.  That.  Yeah.  And what?  This was inside you guys.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dump out.  Did you get that, Ben? 
[04:04:00]  All right.  Yeah, we can't say that.  Don't say anything.  Okay.  All right, Ant, this is where we're at.  The girls collected their money.  They did the twist.  We have probably $400 to $500.  Oh, there's a lot more money left, yeah.  On the floor.  We're going to take a quick break.  The ladies are going to count live on the air, so don't do your counting now.  Yeah, ladies, stay exactly where you are.  No more picking up, Rick.  Just shovel that over, and we'll be fine.  Right, and then the lady that collected the most is going to get to go in the corner  and pick up the rest of the money and go home with that.  All the ladies get to take home what they have in their hands right now. 
[04:04:30]  And you can put the money in a bag when you take it home.  All right.  What?  Can we sit down now?  Yeah, sit down and take a break.  We're actually on the floor, yeah.  We're going to take a break.  Rick, make sure they don't count the money.  Wait, she's counting the money.  No one counts the money.  Yeah, don't count yet.  Don't count yet.  That girl's having a problem.  She's having a breach dollar.  All right.  All right, Anthony, the first phase is over.  When we get back, we're going to crown a winner of the O&A Money Snatch Game. 
[04:05:00]  Yes, I saw a lot of great strategies, Opie.  Yeah, we'll discuss that in just a bit.  Stay there.  We'll be back with more of the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the 2002 Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, well, we completed the O&A Money Snatch Game, Anthony.  Yes, we did.  We completed it. 
[04:05:30]  All of the contestants did a great job, and they are now sitting down with their pile of money.  Their booty of cash, as they call it.  And Stinky has gloves on for some reason, and he's counting all the money that was left on the floor  because one of the girls will walk away with the rest of the money.  Now, it seems like there's always some kind of controversy at the Opie and Anthony Show contest.  Yeah, there's a controversy brewing, Anthony.  And that is why we videotape a lot of our events.  Yes.  Opie, there seems to be a problem. 
[04:06:00]  Rick, if you would please let us know what is brewing.  And I don't mean on the bills.  The controversy that is brewing has to do with one contestant.  Now, who came up with the complaints?  There were a few of the other contestants who made light of the complaint.  Right, and could you maybe ask one of them?  Oh, you mean call them out right here?  Well, yeah, we kind of want to know what's going on. 
[04:06:30]  You know what, though?  They might give away the twist.  No, no, this is what I heard.  There are some contestants that are voicing a bit of a complaint that one of the contestants did not fully have the twist that we talk about.  They didn't fully execute the twist.  Right.  Fully execute the twist.  Gotcha.  And as a result, has ended up visually, a quick visual, with a lot more money than it seemed possible. 
[04:07:00]  Right.  We take these things very seriously, these contests.  They may seem very wacky, very goofy.  Zane even.  Zane-erific.  But we take them seriously.  And as we have looked at the videotape during that last commercial break, because of some of these complaints,  Steve rewound the tape, and we looked, there did seem to be a problem.  We went to the video replay.  I looked at the time also and thought something was amiss. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, boy.  It seems not only was the twist not fully enacted, and not only was it not completely, was all the denominations completely being held in a way that,  in accordance with the twist, but it looks like some of the string that was being used to hold up the bills from the ceiling  was used to fasten some of the money to the money that was in the proper context of the twist. 
[04:08:00]  Well, maybe that was her strategy.  Well, that isn't quite the nature of this.  That isn't quite the way that it was supposed to happen.  The videotape clearly shows a lot of the cash not in compliance with the twist.  So we were being kind of liberal with some of the contestants and the twist, as long as it was in the spirit of the twist. 
[04:08:30]  All right, so what are we going to do?  Tom Hanks didn't use enough string in Castaway as was used on that.  Now, now.  So now there's a little controversy.  How do we deal with the controversy is what I want to know.  Well, let's leave it up to Rick. 
[04:09:00]  You know, that's an interesting offer, Ope.  My suggestion, my suggestion in this would be the girl that we feel from the videotape  and what we saw live that was not in compliance with the twist  be allowed to keep the amount of money that she did get  but has to give up her shot at the count-off. 
[04:09:30]  That's my suggestion.  It's only fair to the other girls.  The contestants are clapping.  It's only fair to the other girls that were in compliance.  And there's only one girl not clapping.  Who's not clapping?  I can't believe it.  Is this acceptable?  Yes.  Do I have any no's?  So let it be written, so let it be done.  So all girls are agreeing that it's fair.  All girls are agreeing.  That one girl gets to keep the money she does have in her hand  but as we now count and see who had the most money. 
[04:10:00]  And then I should add, too, no one got the Kid Rock dollar bill?  No.  So there will be a drawing for this.  Okay.  We will allow that girl a shot at this as well.  All right.  Okay.  Because we're going to figure out how to give away the front row tickets  to the remaining contestants.  Now, before we go on, I would like to give my views on peace in the Mideast.  What needs to be done is...  What?  No?  We don't have time for that?  Someone is screaming on the phone, you can't change the rules now. 
[04:10:30]  Their rules were not changed, Mr. Asswipe CF.  They weren't followed.  Where's Jack Tool on the phone?  They weren't followed.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom.  Tom?  Tom.  Guys.  Speak your piece.  Those other whores in there are just jealous of dating to figure to do it that way.  Tom?  If Matt Solansky was in there, she'd have got it.  Tom, did you see the videotape?  Whores might.  Yes, ladies.  Oh, yes, ladies.  Way to fight back.  Exactly, ladies.  You know what?  F him in the A.  That's right. 
[04:11:00]  That Jack Tool ass.  Shove money in a C.  Right.  Do that.  Girls that are naked collecting dollar bills should not be called whores.  Shut up, F and A.  Ever.  These are our ladies that come down and support the Opie and Anthony show.  Bravo, bravo to you all.  Yes, ladies.  Yes, there are ladies.  Guys don't even understand.  Tom.  Yes.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Yeah.  Go ahead real fast.  All right.  I think you should bring one of them ladies down to a local bank and have one of the tellers 
[04:11:30]  count up the money with the old lick the thumb deal.  The lick thumb count?  That's right.  Make it another thing.  That's a familiar.  I enjoy the lick thumb count.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  I've had this before.  Say, this is dog food.  Dog food.  Who the hell is that guy?  What?  Who is the guy that just came in with a knife?  What?  Who is that?  Oh, all right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I saw Ronnie peering through the window. 
[04:12:00]  Okay, so are we announcing the contestant that is out?  Sure.  Go ahead, Rick.  And that contestant would be Colleen.  Oh, Colleen.  Oh, boy.  Colleen?  The loud one, which means this is going to be a problem.  Did you know we were talking about you?  No.  Oh, my God.  And you were the one that said, yay, yay, right?  Maybe I can help.  You're out, Colleen.  Well, well, Colleen.  Hey.  You know what it is?  We understand.  We understand now that it's very organized and everything, you very well might be able 
[04:12:30]  to do the twist with that.  But based on what we saw during the contest, and what's the problem?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Oh, it is a little shiny down there.  Wow.  I was thinking of counting the money that's left on the floor.  Based on what we saw, and thank goodness, we do have videotape of it.  It looked to be a lot, a massive amount of that.  But it was, well, that also, based on the videotape, a lot of other part of your person 
[04:13:00]  was used to kind of hold that where it's supposed to be.  That's just what we saw.  If you'd like me to prove it to you, I mean.  No, no, no.  Because the way it is now, I could see.  Because you could probably roll it up and do whatever you need to do.  But the way it was, it was very crumpled.  Okay, can I ask you a question?  Maybe.  Then why'd you guys say it was okay?  Exactly.  Very good.  I did not believe it was okay.  There was a yell of okay.  We reviewed the videotape.  I'll still be allowed, because I'll prove it to you right now. 
[04:13:30]  Well, no.  See, like I said, we understand that.  And Rick, why am I now doing this?  I'll explain.  The reason you're allowed to keep the money at all, instead of being disqualified,  was because someone did okay, and so they're saying keep the money.  Because they were going to say disqualified.  I know, but I want to be in the hole.  I'm just saying, that's what the one reason was, because you did get that.  Oh, boy.  I did drive two hours.  Well, maybe should we try for a compromise?  I mean, like, if you want me to prove it to you, I can.  Well, I'm thinking maybe give her 30 seconds to prove it, maybe.  Well, I'm just asking. 
[04:14:00]  See if all the ladies would allow that?  But you know what it is?  It's all organized now.  I had it just like everybody else.  I stood here like this.  Oh, boy.  I stood here like this.  Make a lady yell and scream, and she's going to beat someone up.  This could be very uncomfortable.  If it didn't fall, it wouldn't be.  Yeah, but Steve, could you bring that around for a moment, please?  Sure, one second.  Let me just, once again, do a little review.  I think Anthony should always controversy.  Why don't you check out the video tape?  Always controversy on this program. 
[04:14:30]  And make your official decision, Anthony.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you, Opie.  It's in my effing lap.  Jesus Christ.  I am trying to base this on the fairest way possible.  There's no guarantee that Colleen would have won anyway, because there's some people with some interesting strategies that we'll discuss in a minute.  I have a question.  Does each bill count as one bill?  No, no.  Don't be silly.  It's the highest dollar amount.  So there are... 
[04:15:00]  That's why I'm saying it's messed up.  Let me see.  All right.  Hold on.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're trying to be fair.  We're not trying to screw you.  All right.  Well, it's...  Obviously.  See, there's a very, very lot...  There's a lot of crumpled up money in a ball.  Didn't everybody else was stuck?  No, no.  Everyone else is stuck, because it was in compliance with the twist, let's say.  But what I'm seeing here, and what I saw is, there seems to be a piece of string that is being used to hold the money. 
[04:15:30]  No, because now, like I said, now I don't doubt you could do it, because the bills are lined up.  But that was part of the contest, was knowing if you had enough time to line the bills up.  What you did, I saw, is crumble them, and then, like, push the bills, and then use other parts...  Well, that they're sticking on here seems to be...  I mean, I'm not going to give up the twist, but I had just like I was supposed to have. 
[04:16:00]  No, no, I don't...  They didn't fall.  See, I don't see it as incomplete.  But no, it wasn't about falling.  Believe me, because that's why we said you have to be able to stand without using other parts of your body.  Okay, I was standing like this.  We have it on the video, yeah.  On the video, I was standing like this.  But I see parts of these areas.  Okay.  Right, is holding it.  But, all right, but...  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. 
[04:16:30]  Okay, you shouldn't have said okay.  Well...  Right?  No, that's why we have the videotape.  Well, that's why we have the videotape.  Okay, so then you shouldn't disqualify it.  It's like...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But you're being allowed to keep that money as opposed to just giving it back.  Right.  They're letting you keep that money because they okayed it.  They shouldn't have okayed it.  Yeah.  What should be done, because it would be unfair, would be to say you can't keep any because the rules weren't followed.  But because it was okay, you get to keep that money because you didn't come down and nobody wants to screw you.  You can keep that, but we can't...  And you get a date with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I don't want a date with Jim Norton.  Believe me. 
[04:17:00]  All right.  I got my date sitting right out of the studio.  All right, good.  All right.  Well, you don't have to say that, like, disappointing.  All right.  Well, sorry, but, uh...  For having good taste.  Hey, we will give you a pair of Kid Rock tickets if you don't get the front row tickets.  How's that?  Oh, it's all right.  All right.  We'll take care of you.  Relax.  Are you okay?  We're not trying to get it.  We're not trying to get it.  I got my money.  I got...  She's crying.  She's crying.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Colleen, Colleen.  You all right?  No.  Colleen.  I got my daughter's...  Colleen, okay.  Colleen, Colleen, Colleen, listen to me.  Listen to me. 
[04:17:30]  No one's leaving crying.  We're not...  Hold on.  I'm not crying.  You know what I'm doing?  All right, well, hold on.  We're not going to...  I've been drinking.  All right, listen.  I've been hanging out in Stinky Stairwell too long.  There's no crying in Money Snatch.  Yeah.  I'm not crying.  You know what I'm doing?  Colleen.  Because I'm happy because I want money to...  All right.  I'll pay for my daughter's birthday party.  Oh.  And maybe Jim...  It's heartwarming.  Jim Cook's going to give you a few extra.  Yeah.  Jim, give her some more money.  For Mother's Day.  Yeah, look.  Jim, come on.  Jim, come on.  You're like a multi-millionaire, Jim Cook.  Come on, Jim.  Give her a little more, Jim.  There you go.  What do you got?  Oh, look at him. 
[04:18:00]  Holy cow.  All right, Jim.  Hey, there you go.  Jim, come on.  A Benjamin for Mother's Day.  Hey, hey, give her the...  I ain't going to deny it.  There you go.  Hey.  Good luck to everybody.  Good luck there, Colleen.  Good luck, Colleen.  Wait, Colleen, you got to tell us how much you collected though too because you're still...  I'll wait you in a couple minutes.  All right, let us know.  Wow, look at Jim Cook.  We better talk about it.  The girls are all mad too because they're like, that's not right.  Hey, where's the man?  Come on.  She did something wrong.  Ladies, let me...  All right, all right.  Let me explain something to you. 
[04:18:30]  It's Mother's Day.  Let me explain something to you.  All right, stop.  We can't...  Do we need a stark raving lunatic naked woman attacking us?  Right.  We compromised...  We compromised our morals there.  Because the bottom line was we didn't think it was fair to you girls to have her in the count.  You know what I mean?  But you can't...  But you know what it is?  Regardless of how the count works out, you girls are going to be able to keep whatever money you got.  I understand she...  Well, you made out with 100 extra bucks.  Well, because Jim felt...  Because Jim Cook is trying to get laid is what it is. 
[04:19:00]  Which is, you know, pretty awful.  But that doesn't affect your final count, though.  It does suck.  My mother.  It doesn't affect your final count.  All right, let's get...  We got to get counting because we're running out of time.  Yeah, we're running out of time, man.  So, Rick, why don't we start...  Get up there.  Why don't we...  Nicole.  Oh.  Oh.  Anthony, let's explain what's going on here.  The girl that has the most money is going to get the rest of the money that Stinky's trying to count.  Hey, we did the best we could.  All right, Nicole is counting her money.  Okay.  One, two...  You want me to count out loud?  Yeah, that's fine.  Say buckle my shoe. 
[04:19:30]  Three, four, five...  Oh, it just slides right out of her hand.  Jim Cook, Sam Adams, try the new light beer.  Wait, there's 40 stuck together.  Starting Monday, it'll be in New York.  The only thing on the Opie and Anthony show with good taste.  Yes.  There you go.  Wonderful.  I'm drinking the light.  Sam Adams.  Drinking the light today.  Very good light beer.  Tastes pretty good there, Jim.  You're hard at work there at the brewery, are you?  Two years.  Finally to pass the Anthony test.  You know something?  You spend two years on this? 
[04:20:00]  Screw AIDS or cancer and finding a cure for it.  It's coming up with a great light beer.  Yeah.  Very good, Jim.  Yeah, the world can live with AIDS.  What'd you think?  It's a great light beer we need.  80.  Nicole is just about done with her money there.  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  She's a little girl.  I know.  100 single.  I like how we made them have to count it naked.  $113.  $113. 
[04:20:30]  There you are, little lady.  $113.  Wow.  Nice.  And she was really, really struggling to do the twist on that.  She was the one that was practicing last night.  I did it correctly.  Good thing you didn't get any 20s or 10s.  And I was organized.  You did.  See, you organized your time wisely.  Very nice.  Thank you, Nicole.  Look at Jim.  Guys, this is Robin.  Please get away.  Robin, 6'1".  She's still naked and she is counting.  60, 61.  She had a different strategy, Anthony. 
[04:21:00]  It's time to announce this.  Hoping.  She went right for all the 20s.  She went for the large bills that were taped to the ceiling.  She didn't panic.  She took a look around and saw where the big bills were.  Being the tallest girl gave her the advantage.  She then walked around grabbing the larger bills.  Eating off the top of the tree.  She took her time.  A lot of the girls were scrambling for the singles.  And now she's up to 94.  She still looks to have about 20 bucks left in her hand.  She's up to 100 already.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 
[04:21:30]  20.  And I was there.  3 by 7.  Nice.  $120?  Yes.  $120.  $120.  And that, based on her strategy of grabbing the 20s right away.  Yeah.  Very good strategy she had there.  That's going to be tough to beat, Anthony.  $60 in big bills.  Okay.  Who's up next?  Yeah.  Up next is Shannon.  This little one's a trooper.  Hi, Shannon.  There she is.  The cute blonde with the tongue ring.  With the tongue ring.  I love how the girls are completely naked, like you said.  Yeah.  Counting.  This is how banking should be done. 
[04:22:00]  Where they just count it out.  You go, nobody'd use an ATM.  I'd like to make a withdrawal and a deposit.  If I could.  My liquid assets.  That was funny.  Liquid assets.  Jim Cook, Sam Adams.  Try the new light beer.  $51.  How much?  $51.  Oh, $51.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  That's all right, because you can tell your boyfriend, hey, I can only hold $51. 
[04:22:30]  Right.  Exactly.  One of you girls should have gone out with Jamaican Mike.  You can hold the leaf blower.  All right, guys.  Up next is Casey.  Casey, how you doing?  Anthony, I'm starting to realize that the winner will also be the loser.  Yeah.  She's still got a lot of bills in her hand, a lot of singles now.  I think what they've done, Opie has organized them with the larger bills at the beginning  of their account. 
[04:23:00]  So she only had, I think, two fives as the larger bill.  So that being all singles left in her hand, I don't see as how she's going to pull ahead  in this.  She had a big roll.  80.  80.  I see about 90.  4, 5, 8, 6, 8, 7.  Oh, boy.  $87.  But you know something?  Good job.  You had some fives in there?  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  Those 20s are key, man.  Wow.  I thought it was all singles.  Oh, really?  Oh, stop.  We said it enough?  Yeah.  You're so young looking. 
[04:23:30]  I love her.  All right, guys.  Here's Amber.  Hi, Amber.  Can I say something?  Uh-oh.  What's the matter, Amber?  More problems.  Lowenstein.  There's a little bit more controversy going on.  What happened?  Okay, considering that now I probably have nothing here, the money that I had, I had  like a stack.  A stack of fives and tens.  We were.  At least 20 seconds until the contest was over, the one who was disqualified took all my money  from underneath my knee.  I had it all in my knee and under my knee, and I had it rolled up, and she took it and  said that she didn't know.  Yeah, and she said she didn't know. 
[04:24:00]  I think that's part of the rules, though.  You've got to keep it secured.  Wow, we're going to have to go to the winter meetings and really figure out new rules for  the money snatch game, Anthony.  She says that she stole her money.  $27.  $27.  Oh, my God.  I don't think there's anything you can do about that.  It's like a free-for-all kind of crazy thing, but it does.  I understand.  All right.  That's why I was angry that you gave her $100. 
[04:24:30]  You know, Joe, I want to comment to Joe from the Bronx on Instant Feedback.  Joe from the Bronx, and his email address, JTrumpet.  I won't give the at, but, you know, it's one of them.  Too cryptic.  Now we're totally clueless.  Poorly run contest.  Joe, are you retarded?  Kid, who the hell at this point can't figure things out, Joe?  Right.  Joe, Joe, Joe. 
[04:25:00]  Jump in front of a bus right now up in the Bronx.  Do the world a favor, you ignorant F.  Rick?  Guys, that was Maria.  She just counted out.  $68.  $68.  $68.  And you have a couple of...  It could have been $69.  You have a couple of 20s in there, too?  I'll give you a buck.  Wow.  Jimmy gave her a buck.  There you go.  $69.  All right.  $69.  So who's in the lead with $120 again?  Robin?  That would be Robin.  Tall girl.  Okay.  How many girls we got left?  Two more.  All right.  Elena?  Come on up here.  What? 
[04:25:30]  I don't know.  Here's Elena.  Wow.  The cafe latte.  Steve?  Yeah.  Cafe very latte.  I'm straightened out anyway.  Well, you didn't take any time to...  Did somebody help you with their fist?  Almighty.  How's it looking over there, Rick?  Does she have a lot?  She's got a lot.  I see some tens crumbled up there,  but she didn't straighten out any of her money.  That's 30 pounds of bologna into a three-pound bag.  Nothing.  What's the total? 
[04:26:00]  I'm not sure.  She's got a...  Good thing you didn't uncrumple it during commercial.  It's all crumpled.  Hey, Stinky, how much money is left on the floor?  Six hundred and twenty-seven bucks.  Wow.  Yumping Yemeni.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Good gosh.  Six hundred and twenty-eight.  I'll say.  He just found another one.  All right, Elena, what do you think?  You didn't organize your money, did you?  All right, get the other girl counting, too,  because we're running out of show here. 
[04:26:30]  What the hell were you doing?  There's a buck up there.  Down there.  You were sitting for how long?  Julia was coming up, and she's got a big stack.  All right, I think it's going to be between Robin and maybe Jewel.  Jewel might have a shot at taking the rest here.  You think?  No.  We're looking for a hundred and twenty bucks.  A hundred and twenty is in the league.  A hundred and twenty is the limit.  Yep.  A hundred and twenty.  Oh, wait, no, no.  That girl did not organize her money at all.  The whole time she was sitting there,  she did not even straighten it out.  Well, they're both counting.  The last two contestants. 
[04:27:00]  How stereotypical.  Hey.  You sure you want to just leave it in a pile like that?  The other girl might run in and take it.  You know how she is.  I love the rubber gloves snapping on the entrance.  This is like a crack den when they're all adding the money in the crack dens.  They never wear clothes so they don't rip the dealers off.  Count my money, bitch.  That's great.  I am never using money again. 
[04:27:30]  No, no.  I am now completely using Amex.  I believe in credit cards.  American Express.  Tell her, my bill has the texture of a slug.  It still has a string on it.  $629 left on the floor, Anthony.  $629.  And the girl that collected the most will get $629 more.  Oh, my goodness.  Helena, how much?  $631.  $921.  $921 for Helena.  $922 for Helena. 
[04:28:00]  $922 for Helena.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  $922.  $922.  $922.  Is it getting close, Rick?  It's getting close.  She's at $90.  All right.  She's got a roll left.  Wow.  She might win it all.  Wow.  That would be interesting.  Count out loud.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  And she's so petite.  $922.  I know.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  $922.  Eric in his head, no.  $106.  $106.  $106.  Just a few bucks short. 
[04:28:30]  Can I point something out?  The girl came in and said she gave the count.  She said $319.  That includes the $100.  Had she not been disqualified, she would have had $219.  She would have won it all.  So it did work out for everybody.  What?  She would have won.  What?  The girl in there had $219.  Which is impossible.  Let me just say.  Well, that's probably with Jim Cook's.  No, no, no.  $319 with his money.  No, it was $219.  So she collected $100 more than everyone else.  It's impossible.  $219.  It's impossible.  We made the right decision there. 
[04:29:00]  Anthony, I think who wins?  It would be Robin.  Robin wins.  Robin wins the O&A Money Snatch game.  She gets the $629 that was left on the floor that Stinky had a count.  Wow.  Look at that hand over those bills.  Steve, very daring.  You're going to report that to the IRS?  It really stinks.  Huddle, huddle.  I'm going to go over there and gem my rib into Jimmy's ribs.  My elbow, I stink.  This concludes the 2002 Money Snatch on the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[04:29:30]  For photos and videos of this event, go to O.B.AndAnthony.com or FoundryMusic.com.  O.B. and Anthony.  The O.B. and Anthony Show is taking a short break in the middle of March because let's  face it, when you work in a confined environment with a bunch of volatile personalities, all  of whom think that their opinion is the most valid, you can pretty much last a few months  before you want to go on a fucking shooting rampage.  Die!  Die! 
[04:30:00]  Die!  So we're taking a little time for ourselves to decompress and regroup.  Until then, enjoy the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Or go outside.  You're all pretty much shut-ins anyway.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  I like my penis.  All right, we got the XM Satellite Radio ads.  These are great.  This is why we're brilliant broadcasters.  We see the future.  We saw the future many years ago before we fucked up on commercial radio.  I see flying cars in Mylar suits in the next 10 years. 
[04:30:30]  Everybody's going to be wearing Mylar suits.  We will have flying cars.  We got this right?  Yeah, we certainly did get this right.  We can predict the future now.  So just to give you the setup, before we became the pioneers of satellite radio, Anthony  and I were doing the old commercial radio thing.  Way back when.  Barely remember what that was like.  We were very successful, syndicated across America in some fine markets, and then we blew  it up.  Might have heard of a little town called Boston.  That's right.  Might have heard of a little hamlet of Philadelphia. 
[04:31:00]  Let's not forget Columbus, Ohio.  Can't we, please?  And of course, New York City, the crossroads of the world.  Perhaps.  How about Vegas?  How about Vegas?  Philly, D.C., Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle.  How about a chilly little place called Buffalo, New York?  Buffalo and Rochester, New York.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  There you have it.  Just a few of the markets.  That was everyone.  How about New Orleans? 
[04:31:30]  New Orleans, that's right.  Cleveland.  Chicago.  Dallas, Texas.  I said Dallas already.  I like to say Dallas, so I said it again.  All right.  Sacramento, California.  Sacramento.  Anyway, so we're doing quite well, and everybody wanted to advertise on our show.  Even XM Satellite Radio.  They knew.  They knew.  They knew the demo we held, the power we held with it.  They knew who they wanted initially when the satellite started up.  And right off the bat, this goes back easily three years.  Right off the bat, we're like, this is the future of radio. 
[04:32:00]  It's growing by leaps and bounds.  This is definitely competition.  We have to look at it as competition right off the bat.  Seriously, what did you honestly think when you first heard, like, satellite radio, you  can say whatever the hell you want?  Weren't you thinking somewhere, I want to be on that?  Absolutely.  But at the time, first of all, we were in a contract.  Second of all, we were doing really well.  We were doing really well.  Well, and satellite radio was still kind of just growing, you know?  They only had, at this point, they only had a few hundred thousand listeners. 
[04:32:30]  Probably, yeah.  Probably less than a million.  Yeah, it had to be less than a million.  I don't even know.  Over three, dude.  We were off for two fucking years.  So this is over three.  Maybe three and a half, four years ago.  I'm sure they had under a million listeners and subscribers.  And, you know, to go over there, it was almost, everyone was equating it to, like, E-Yada,  that online radio where, you know, 50 people at a time could listen and then it started clipping. 
[04:33:00]  And people on it were, like, approaching us and going, dude, it's the future.  Is this internet radio?  And I'm like, you know, no, it's not.  No, I can't get my computer on the dashboard.  So, no, it's not.  Can't get it in the car, especially at that point.  Yeah.  You couldn't do that.  So, no, it wasn't.  We weren't considering it.  Right.  Timing-wise, it worked out perfectly.  What's interesting about this, this goes back, like I said, three to four years ago.  And guys on regular radio today are still denying that satellite radio is going to be anything. 
[04:33:30]  Yep.  Dummies.  A bunch of dummies out there.  So, we did not feel good about taking the XM satellite radio ads as we're doing our commercial radio show.  We let it be known.  And we let it be known.  And they're like, just shut up and play the commercials.  Right.  And one day, we just, we had it.  We absolutely had it.  So, the commercial's playing for XM satellite radio.  And the commercial's saying how great XM is.  And I just turned on the mics and said, fuck this.  It's like, the competition is now advertising on our show, Anthony. 
[04:34:00]  So, whether you're into hip-hop or b-bop, we have sales wars that work in this building.  Rock stars or stock cars.  You'll hear more.  No more.  This is the competition.  What I'm hooked on right now.  This is the competition, you whores.  White variety is things I've never heard before.  I could drive all the way to New York, never have to change the channel.  All right.  Oh, good.  Thanks.  Turn off the old me and Anthony show, because satellite radio's here.  This is your local electronic store for demonstration.  You effing whores upstairs.  Learn more at XMRadio.com. 
[04:34:30]  What?  It is absolutely fabulous.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  This is the competition.  Wake up.  To the power of this.  Price may vary by model and retailer.  Some models require additional installation fee.  And tenants and subscription also requires it.  Douchebag.  What are you doing this New Year's Eve?  Isn't that amazing?  Opie's just yelling like a maniac right over the commercial.  Isn't that amazing, though?  That wasn't a recording, by the way, of the commercial playing and then Opie off air ranting  about it.  Oh, no.  That was on the air.  That is how it aired.  That's how their fine commercial aired.  XM should get their money back for that one. 
[04:35:00]  They did when they signed us, please.  Just letting the Trojan horse come rolling in.  Oh, my God.  Hey, this is a pretty horse for them to leave for us.  Just to put it in perspective.  That would be like us running ads for Howard for the other satellite radio company.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Taking their money and going, well, it's money.  It's revenue.  Who cares?  It's the competition.  And that's what the party line was over at Infinity was, hey, they're paying for it. 
[04:35:30]  We'll air their commercials.  They saw it as no threat.  They had no vision that this was going to do anything.  Yeah.  And they just saw it as, hey, take their money.  Oh, that's so short-sighted.  You've got to be cutthroat.  Cutthroat.  Fuck you.  Advertise on the internet.  It gets better.  So then when we were done with our 15 minutes of commercials, we finally got to go back to  our regular show.  And this is how we got back into it.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oy!  And it's official.  We have a bunch of whores that work for this company.  That's for sure. 
[04:36:00]  Holy S.  We're running a spot on the Opie and Anthony show for satellite radio.  Yeah.  Satellite radio.  You know, it's the new range.  And no one has a problem with this in this company?  That's called the competition.  Right.  They're advertising during our show, telling people basically that they have another option  out there.  That all over, like, no matter where you drive, you won't lose the signal.  They're talking about all this great stuff that you don't get by listening to the very 
[04:36:30]  station that's advertising it.  Who is, who gave the okay to take that?  Bunch of whores.  Hard enough to compete in this day and age in radio.  And now, now they're just going to run spots for the competition on our show.  And they have no problem with this whatsoever.  So there you go.  Just so you're not confused.  That's us, you know, four years ago about on regular radio, just losing our minds because 
[04:37:00]  they're running XM spots during our show.  And it was so obvious that people were starting to get excited about satellite radio.  It was something that, as we were listening to it, you'd say to yourself, wow, that does  sound cool.  You get all kinds of formats of music.  You could drive coast to coast and not have to change the station once if you don't want  to.  It's not regulated by the FCC.  This is fan-fucking-tastic. 
[04:37:30]  And this proves we're brilliant broadcasters because now, three, four years later, you  know, regular radio is in deep trouble.  In deep trouble.  They could have controlled it a little bit if they were smart enough to see what was  coming four years ago.  They still advertise, though, right?  They still allow them to advertise?  No.  Finally, they've turned the corner of most of these radio companies and they will not  accept spots for satellite radio.  Finally.  Wow.  It continues.  They're making spots against satellite radio now. 
[04:38:00]  Exactly.  Now, the same stations that were airing, hey, this satellite radio is great.  Come on over.  We'd love to have you.  Are now going, hey, why pay for radio?  Now, they're all, why pay for fucking radio, man?  You don't want to pay for it.  Well, we got the famous one.  We got like 10 of them, but here's the one we really like.  Here's some of the same stations that were running the commercials you just heard.  Right.  Now, this is today what they're doing on regular radio.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing 
[04:38:30]  a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars, but this time, the guilty  party is none other than the easy listening sensation.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio, you shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some things  were just meant to be free.  A bit hypocritical, isn't it? 
[04:39:00]  Don't.  Pay no attention to those commercials we aired three or four years ago.  We really didn't mean it.  We were just in for the cash.  That's right.  I bought a new boat from that money.  So outrageous, we can't even tell you on the radio.  Yeah, they're still not getting it right.  But they can on a satellite, by the way.  You know how she was saying?  Handed it in the old XM commercial right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So then going back, here's us on commercial radio.  Really pissed off because we have XM commercials on our show. 
[04:39:30]  We discuss it more here.  They bought our show because we have a huge audience, okay?  Yeah.  And the commercial is basically telling everyone that you don't need to listen to Opie and Anthony.  There's other choices out there.  Why don't they just run a commercial with every other show that is on against us?  Yeah.  And then have the listeners decide, well, I'm going to try out a couple of these shows.  I got an idea.  Here's what he's going to say.  Oh, they're not going to do well.  It's just like that click radio and the E-Yada and all the internet radio thing that failed. 
[04:40:00]  So we'll take a little bit of their money and it'll just fail anyway.  But the thing is, it's not like internet radio.  It's going to be installed in cars and stuff.  Oh, that HBO, it'll never catch on.  That'll never catch on.  It's silly.  People paying for TV, it'll never happen.  If man were meant to fly, he'd have wings.  That is a huge insult, man.  I hope they're getting a lot of money to whore themselves out like that. 
[04:40:30]  Man can't ride on trains.  Don't you know if a human being exceeds 30 miles an hour, he will surely perish.  You know, they used to think that.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It really is.  So there you go.  We're back here on XM.  That's pretty impressive.  Kind of taking a look at the old days, four years ago when they accepted XM spots on our very successful commercial radio show.  We saw.  We had the vision.  We knew that this was going to be successful.  We always have the vision. 
[04:41:00]  You know where the next step is.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  People just don't realize that yet.  And that's our frustration every day.  Finally, I had it.  You're going to hear a curse.  And you're listening to satellite radio, so like whatever, a curse.  Just remember, going back about three or four years, this is on commercial radio, but I was just losing my mind.  I just couldn't understand why they would do this to us.  Radio is really the best part.  Yeah, I got to stop the tape.  The best part, there's good old Ben Sparks in the background laughing like an idiot. 
[04:41:30]  Years ago, cackling Ben included.  Just in case you thought this was the new Ben on XM, no.  He's been laughing like an idiot for many years for us.  Many years.  Radio is really getting pathetic.  It's ridiculous.  This used to be a business where every radio station was for themselves, and they just fought, literally fought on the street.  We used to get in fights because someone else's van was parked outside the venue for a concert.  Now all the stations are owned by the same person or the same company, and they don't want you talking bad about this station or that station because you're going to hurt the company. 
[04:42:00]  It's making radio so bland and boring.  And now on top of that, they don't mind taking advertising dollars from the competition.  Right.  They see no problem with this.  Holy shit!  They don't see a problem with this?  Will there be cursing over this satellite radio?  Because I want to gig over there.  I'm sure.  I'm sure. 
[04:42:30]  I want to gig over there.  You know.  It's not regulated.  And here we are back on XM.  Look at that.  I want to gig over there.  Cursing on asking, you shall receive.  I should hand that tape in to the FCC.  We got away with one back then.  Someone is requesting.  Let me go to Pete.  I haven't heard this stuff in a long time.  Pete in Rhode Island.  Pete?  Yes.  Hey.  I was wondering if you guys could play the clip where you get your bigger boss on the phone,  and he's like, oh, don't worry about XM. 
[04:43:00]  No, they're nothing.  They're nothing.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  I think that's the next clip we got here.  Oh, excellent.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  Thanks.  I don't remember how this went down, but then we just would not go on with our show.  We were obsessed with this whole playing XM commercials on our commercial radio show.  And finally, we got Ken Stevens, our general manager, on the phone.  What a set of balls when you have the ratings that we had.  Oh, I know.  Over there.  Because you could just do anything except have a couple fucking church. 
[04:43:30]  But besides that, I mean, anything.  Right.  We're cursing.  Yeah.  I don't think we got in trouble for that.  So we got Ken Stevens.  He was the guy running the station at the time.  He was one of our really good friends over there.  Yeah, we like Ken.  That's stuck up for us on many occasions with that whole stupid Howard battle.  But here's Ken explaining the XM ads to us.  So the question is, somebody said to me, you're wondering why we're taking these XM satellite ads? 
[04:44:00]  Very good.  You actually understood the question also, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Why are we advertising for satellite radio an option to listening to this very program?  Pretend for a minute that you don't know anything about the radio business, and you're just the average guy listening in your car to those XM radio spots.  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me put myself in there, Ken.  Here we go.  You asked us for a lot, and you're not giving us time. 
[04:44:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay, I'm sitting.  Opie, sit.  So you're saying advertising doesn't work, and no one should advertise on radio.  Maybe it's your show.  No.  Holy shit.  He's also basically talking down to the listeners, too.  Right.  They're a bunch of morons.  They don't understand words like satellite.  It's something up in space, and they don't know that.  You've got to be a rocket scientist to know about satellites. 
[04:45:00]  Jesus Christ, Ken.  Meanwhile, the ad completely explains it.  And they have everyday Joes going, I can get in my car and drive all the way across the country.  They gave me the ABCs of satellite radio.  You want to hear any format you want from coast to coast without changing the dial?  Satellite radio.  All right.  You've got to slow that down, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm just the average everyday guy.  I can't take in words that quick.  I didn't understand what you meant by format of music.  Fuck, I should have taped the show.  Then I could rewind it. 
[04:45:30]  Oh, is that a poor, poor argument?  Oh, I nailed him so bad.  Yeah.  Advertising doesn't work.  Advertising doesn't work.  Oh, no, no.  It's just fine.  Keep it coming.  Going back to the tape.  I know I'm saying this a million times, but there are dummies out there.  This is us on commercial radio discussing why are we playing XM commercials.  It's your show.  No.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them, they're not awfully attractive to anybody.  Did you hear, okay, did you hear the one line?  How many of your friends are going to go out and spend whatever, what does it say? 
[04:46:00]  On, on, on, now insert color TV here, insert radio here, insert car here, where he is going to say, are going to buy this right now?  I don't know.  Insert Xbox instead of PlayStation.  Right.  Insert any new technology.  Ken, did you hear the one part in that commercial where he says, boy, I could drive through New York and I don't have to change the station.  No, I heard the one where he said, and my favorite is the Blues Channel.  Right. 
[04:46:30]  Right.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the Blues Channel.  Well, not.  Wow, you guys.  When those ratings come out and they're down, who will be getting yelled at?  Hey, you know what?  If your ratings are down and your audience has moved over to satellite radio, I'll stop taking those commercials.  Yeah, but it's a little here, a little there.  It adds up after a while.  Absolutely.  I don't think I've ever seen you guys so 100% in the right.  Isn't it so cool?  It is almost like me and Opie went into a DeLorean. 
[04:47:00]  We reached 88 miles an hour, went to the future, came back, and just shoved it in Ken's face.  We have seen it.  And you know how many people did come over to XM with us?  Everything he said, like, well, you know, little by little, it starts to end up.  It adds up.  The programming.  Oh, it's the Blues Channel.  Yeah, well, some people want to hear that.  Plus, what I also love is you guys were getting in trouble for shitting on the people who advertise, and that's exactly what he's doing here. 
[04:47:30]  Yeah.  Have you listened to those ads?  Those ads stink.  They don't even make sense.  They don't even make sense.  I didn't understand a word.  Bill, it's called.  And their product stinks.  I wouldn't listen to the Blues Channel.  Bill, I don't think we're going to.  If your ratings go down because of satellite, I'll stop taking the ads.  Bill, it's called chipping away.  Chipping away.  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.  We're big fans of chipping away.  Chip, chip, chip, chip.  You know, he had to take the call from the guy who was paying for the ads for XM right after that.  Then he'd go, okay, wait a second.  I want you to just imagine that you don't know anything about advertising. 
[04:48:00]  Yeah.  He's always wanting us to imagine something.  Yeah.  Picture, if you will.  Right, right.  A world in which.  Right.  People who speak English do not understand it.  We love the chipping away concept.  We've been chipping away at Howard's credibility for years and his hypocrisies.  Satellite radio.  It's not going to go anywhere.  They barely got up that Sputnik thing.  Right.  You think they're going to be able to get a satellite up there that plays music?  It continues.  We ended up giving these guys like a 20 to 30 minute commercial that day. 
[04:48:30]  And we helped them out.  You're going to leave cars at the airport and rent them and people are going to.  Chat will never fly.  People want to have the comfort of their own vehicle.  Right.  They'll have a relative who could pick them up.  Craziness.  Not going to want that.  Why would people want a turbine jet engine when they are.  Propeller is perfectly fine on these aircraft.  You can cross country in a day.  They're too noisy and people are not going to like them.  Why would you want to.  Propeller gives people a comfort factor. 
[04:49:00]  They see it spinning and know they're being propelled.  Who would want to go to the bathroom in their own house.  When a perfectly good outhouse is right outside keeping the stink and stench out of doors.  Fertilizing your backyard.  Why would you want a direct flight to Vegas when you could go all the way to LA and then  go to Vegas after having one of your tickets canceled.  People like seeing different cities.  Even ones that they don't want to go to.  Why would you want to fly into the airport that has your car?  That's just plain stupid.  That is ridiculous.  When you could fly to another airport. 
[04:49:30]  It's still an airport.  Drive from that airport to the airport where your car is at.  I want you to imagine for a second you know nothing about travel.  Right.  Imagine you're sitting on a plane that's going where you don't want to go.  That's right.  And you're just excited.  Oh, you don't have to imagine.  You were there.  That's why, Don, I'm so tough because I'm sick of working with dummies.  Wow.  That's why.  Jiminy Cricket.  You went for big air on that one.  Dummies. 
[04:50:00]  Lots and lots of dummies.  We're proving that we're brilliant broadcasters right here and now.  We have the vision.  We can see into the future.  Just trust us.  That was pretty damn impressive.  I got to give you that.  That was very, like, wow.  We got more because then there's a question here.  Could ONA go to satellite?  Oh, Jesus.  So going back in time, we're doing our commercial radio show discussing why they're playing XM commercials on our show.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something. 
[04:50:30]  By the way, we also did our research.  Right.  We study this fucking business.  We know our enemies.  We pay attention.  So when someone is saying, well, you're going to be running XM commercials,  we're not going to sit there like every other dumb jock in America and go, oh, okay, okay.  We actually did our research and found out as much info as possible.  And Anthony is like, you know, this whole going to be an option in new cars.  That's what frightened me the most is I could see something.  If you had to take all kinds of wires and gadgets and gizmos that it was never really going to take off anywhere past just the geek or tech guy or something like that. 
[04:51:00]  But when I heard that these things were going to be factory installed with your AM, FM radio, satellite radio available right there, just like AM and FM, I was like, oh, boy, now there's trouble.  But I love the bravado of this.  He starts every, like, answer with this little John Wayne.  Oh, that was how Ken operated.  Let me tell you something.  We love him. 
[04:51:30]  And Ken wasn't just any general manager.  He was one of the bigwigs.  He was one of the most powerful general managers in infinity broadcasting.  Here we go again.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  You got that newfangled cable or satellite in your house?  You need money this bad day.  With all those music channels on there?  You want us to give some of the money back?  Yeah.  Including the blues channel?  I think it's great, as a matter of fact.  And if you look at broadcast TV, the rating's down pretty low because of cable. 
[04:52:00]  Answer my question.  Yeah, I do.  So when you're sort of walking around the house, instead of turning on the radio, you turn on channel 956 and listen to the blues channel or the kids channel?  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away.  There's my TV and there's my radio, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm not watching TV in my car.  Why assume all this, Ken?  Do we need the money that bad? 
[04:52:30]  Yeah.  Hey, we're in the...  Why don't we just list all the shows that are on opposite us?  Because that's what you just did.  You're killing us.  You know, I took out the one where XM wanted to run the spot that said you were boring.  I didn't run that one.  Really?  Yeah, no.  I stuck to the one that said blues channel.  The company has no problem with this?  I guess not.  Must have been a big buy.  Must have been here.  It wasn't a...  Well, they probably will now that you've made an issue out of it.  Uh-oh. 
[04:53:00]  It was supposed to be under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners are stupid.  And this thing is something that Ken has dubbed newfangled.  Newfangled.  So I don't think it'll take off.  I don't think you guys were paying attention, but that's okay.  All right, Ken.  Well, thank you.  That wasn't what I said.  Thank you for clearing that up for us.  I mean, if you're really certain that you're losing listeners to that blues channel on satellite radio, I'll stop taking the commercials.  That's all he had was that reference. 
[04:53:30]  He just didn't...  The blues channel.  He did not see the freight train barreling down, man.  Do you think he's just holding the company line, or he really believed that?  I don't know.  I think he really believed it.  I think they all believed it.  I think they all did.  But all the heads, you know, and this went right up to Mel Karmazin, who had the same ideology, who was, you know, no ad for a competing form of entertainment would be taken if the word wasn't handed down by Mel.  So he didn't see it either. 
[04:54:00]  And now he's the head of the Doggy Company.  So he obviously changed his tune.  Exactly.  Well, we have one more clip here.  It's quick.  Going back again.  This is like four years ago.  There was a day when sales didn't control radio, Anthony, but now controls it.  I remember a time that they would fight with the competition, but now they welcome the business of the competition on their airwaves.  Let's see. 
[04:54:30]  Hundreds of distortion-free channels that travel with you being offered in high-end cars driven by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight, but, you know, I don't want to talk about it.  Let's plug Rich Voss.  I wonder if at some point they'll make deals with people like us to carry our show.  If people want that as an alternative no matter where they drive.  But then it says, okay, what about if you're driving through an area that we're on at a regular radio station and you can get it on satellite? 
[04:55:00]  Where's the revenue coming from?  It just throws a whole bunch of things.  Following the logic of this, I'm just assuming that this great company of ours is buying satellite radio.  Well, you know something.  And they're jumping the gun.  It makes sense.  But you know what?  Get it up there.  They're probably not buying satellite radio.  No?  But instead, they're running ads for the competition.  And no one sees anything wrong with that.  Ah, Joe, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's happening? 
[04:55:30]  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just want to know.  Can you repeat everything?  You said I lost the signal, man.  That's classic, you dick.  Very good.  And there you have it.  We're back live here on XF.  Isn't that just amazing?  Visionaries.  Visionaries, yes.  Yes.  We just don't say we're brilliant broadcasters.  We show it to you.  If that was like a made-for-TV movie, I'd be like, ah, that's, you know, one person.  So far-fetched.  Yeah, like, no one's ever that wrong. 
[04:56:00]  Like, whenever they do the made-for-TV movies, it's always like, let me tell you something,  Terry Bradshaw, you're never going to be a quarterback.  And you certainly will not win any championships.  And then you're like, no one ever fucking said that.  That is just over-dramatizing of this to sell this show.  And that's literally what went down.  Exactly what happened.  Ken Swaggering.  Don't you worry about that, boys.  The Blues Channel. 
[04:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  When you go home, and he's trying to relate the two things, being at home and those.  Upper channels where the music channels are.  Yeah.  You know, you hit there, you get to listen to 70s, 80s, all kinds of music on your TV or  your radio.  It is different.  I don't listen to those channels on my television, but I have a radio at home, and I listen to  satellite radio.  Yeah.  I listen to those channels on the TV now.  I've done that.  Is that because people are starting to chip away at that, too, and realize, oh, wow, 
[04:57:00]  I've just got to go up here, and I can get all these music channels?  But I have XM right there in my living room.  Right.  Well, and if you've got the DirecTV, you've got the XM channels right there.  On your TV.  Oh, boy.  Was Ken so wrong.  And a lot of people.  I see nothing with the Sex for Sam thing.  Guys, you go right ahead with it.  Three years running.  Maybe we should have had someone else in charge.  A lot of people want to know where Ken Stevens is today.  He's on a boat.  He's sailing the Chesapeake Bay.  He just sails day in and day out.  That's it. 
[04:57:30]  That's what he does now.  He's enjoying his retirement, his early retirement.  A golden umbrella.  His early retirement that we gave him on a gold platter, and now he's got a golden parachute.  Time to cash in the stock option.  Yep.  Time to go sailing.  Whoops.  What do you think he's investing his money in?  Satellite radio.  I would guarantee he's got shares of one company or the other. 
[04:58:00]  There is satellite radio.  I would guarantee every single radio executive has shares of either XM or Sirius or both.  Every single one of them.  They bash it.  They don't believe in it.  They make ads saying don't listen to it.  Don't buy it.  And I believe most of them.  It should be free.  And they buy, buy, buy the stock.  And I believe most of them are listening to satellite radio, too.  Yeah.  Secretly sending, faxing their resumes over.  Oh, of course.  Under assumed names.  You know they make good blind boxes, they're called. 
[04:58:30]  They make good salaries, these guys.  So they probably have newer vehicles where their factory installs of satellite radio.  Do you honestly believe they are trolling through all of those fucking commercials that they can't stand, or they're listening to satellite and listening to the music they want to hear or the talk they want to hear?  Mm-hmm.  They're such hypocrites.  So fast forward to the present.  Now we got a hold of some of the free radio ads by celebrities.  Now they're getting the celebrities on board. 
[04:59:00]  At first it was just monotone guys saying, be free.  Well, just to follow, at first they accepted all the satellite radio ads, and now satellite radio has become something.  Now they're like, oh, fuck.  We got to make anti-satellite radio ads.  Dummies.  It really is funny when you look at the whole big picture here.  They could have taken out a couple steps there, you know, just ignore.  The key is to just ignore it.  That's what they should have done is just completely ignore satellite radio.  Yes.  But they actually helped this business grow.  They certainly did.  Thank you.  They probably sped it along, who knows, maybe six to eight months, you know. 
[04:59:30]  It probably grew that much faster because of what commercial radio was doing.  It's like being on stage at, like, Caroline's, and then behind you they have a banner for some other club right there.  Right down the street.  Another club that's convenient, right there, better.  Yeah.  Where the comedians are uncensored.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And you can go see whatever comedian you want to hear.  Right.  Yeah, you just walk in.  And in between my act, it would just stop, and there would just be, I don't know, some sort of intermission. 
[05:00:00]  Yeah, it's like saying the waitresses are hotter, showing more cleavage.  There's more booze in your drinks.  If you're lucky, you'll get two for one, you know.  All right, here's Bon Jovi talking about free radio.  Before we sold a million faces and rocked them all, before we could sell out Giants Stadium,  Moscow's Lennon Stadium, or London's Wembley Stadium, before we could close down Times Square  just to play for a half a million people, before my band became a household name, before we  sold more than 100 million albums, you heard Bon Jovi on the radio. 
[05:00:30]  Oh, there's one thing I hang on to.  Radio.  You hear it here first.  That's because when they made it, there was no satellite radio, you fucking idiot.  Is that a good thing?  I don't know what that means.  It doesn't mean anything.  I don't know what that means.  They're just so stupid in commercial radio.  What does that mean?  Before we discovered a gold rush in California, we rode a Conestoga wagon across the country. 
[05:01:00]  Yeah.  And there's planes now.  What are they trying to accomplish with these ads?  What does it mean?  They're making it seem like Bon Jovi had the option.  Do you want to be on free radio?  Or satellite radio didn't exist during the slippery when wet days of 1986, maybe?  And here, just because, you know, everywhere you look, there's hypocrisy.  Derek, hit it.  Hi, this is Jon Bon Jovi, and I'm proud to be one of the five million subscribers to the XM Nation. 
[05:01:30]  Wait a minute.  Come on, Jon.  What is it?  Make a stand, man.  Jon.  We love Jon Bon Jovi.  Make a stand.  What is he?  Jon.  What is it, man?  That is, he is completely on both ends of the spectrum on that one.  You have to be. 
[05:02:00]  And I'm proud.  But you know what you have to be as the artist?  Anything.  Wherever they're playing your shit, man.  Right.  Wherever they are playing your shit, you've got to smooch that ass.  I've never gotten involved in feuds between different comedy clubs.  Like, if you play this club, you play that.  No.  Yeah.  That's your fight.  Yeah.  Just lick it.  Lick the ass.  There's the XM ass and the free radio ass.  Lick them both.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This story, the headline, spanking cure for neck ache. 
[05:02:30]  What?  This is a sick story, too.  Spanking cure for neck ache.  What is this?  A chiropractor, right?  Yeah.  A chiropractor spanked a sportswoman's bottom after she went to him with whiplash injuries.  A court heard yesterday.  A court.  She's suing now?  The chiropractor, because he decided that, you know, to get rid of her whiplash or her  neck pain, he needed to spank her.  Do you like having your back rubbed? 
[05:03:00]  Ian, 37, also probed intimate areas of her body.  Nice.  Sometimes without wearing gloves.  What, that makes it offensive if you don't have the gloves on?  Why wear gloves?  It doesn't feel as good.  If you're going to molest somebody, I mean, really.  So if the doctor invades your balloon knot with a glove on, it's like, yeah, no big deal.  But if he doesn't have the glove on, then there's the problem?  Well, if you're a chiropractor and he's fading your balloon knot, that's a proctologist could 
[05:03:30]  probably get away with it with the glove on.  Or without the glove.  Could you imagine that, though?  If, like, you go to a proctologist and you don't need to see him put the gloves on.  Jesus.  I enjoy my work.  I call this my stinky pinky.  This is my stinky pinky.  Here it is.  Here it goes.  Let me just.  Yeah.  All right.  No, you feel fine. 
[05:04:00]  Yeah.  Damn, this story's turning me on.  Listen to this one, man.  The chiropractor asked the 30-year-old to bring in a stick so that he could perform a nerve  block test on her buttocks.  A stick?  Bring in a stick so that he could perform a nerve block test on her buttocks.  On her buttocks.  Nice.  The test at the clinic allegedly involved whipping her bottom until it left her sore and bruised. 
[05:04:30]  That's good.  Well, that's one way to forget about the neck pain.  Butt sex.  Puss-a!  Puss-a!  He usually locked the door of his office and never offered a chaperone during some 160  therapy sessions.  With the same girl?  When do you figure that the guy is, you know, molesting you?  Yeah.  It wasn't like the first or second time.  It took 160 visits before she realized, wait, wait, there's a problem here.  This isn't right. 
[05:05:00]  Wow.  On one occasion, he asked a woman who is a keen athlete to bring alcohol to his clinic.  What, like to drink?  Because she was tense.  Bring a stick so I could spank you.  Bring some alcohol because you're tense.  You gotta lighten up.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  The woman's boyfriend became suspicious and took photographs of her alleged injuries to  the police. 
[05:05:30]  Oh, my God.  We have audio from the judge in this case.  Yeah.  Your days of finger-banging old Mary Jane's rotten crotch through her pretty pink panties  are over.  Wow, he sounded pissed.  So they arrest the chiropractor at his home?  Yeah.  And this is what he had to say.  Stay out of the bushes!  No, he said, Anthony, if you will allow me here.  Don't just stare at it. 
[05:06:00]  Eat it.  I don't know what he was saying.  Opie?  If you would let me.  They arrested the chiropractor.  And he had this to say.  You're a filthy whore!  Oh, that's not what he said, you ass.  All right.  What did he say?  All right, listen.  How'd you like to shut my ass?  And, please. 
[05:06:30]  Right.  We're trying to do serious news on this show.  All right, so they go to the chiropractor's house, and they arrest him.  Uh-huh.  And the chiropractor said,  Cancel your appointments!  Come on.  No.  There's one line left in the story, Ed.  Okay, I'm trying to listen.  I don't know what happened.  All right.  All right, so they went to the guy's house, the chiropractor.  Right.  Who molested this lady, obviously, after 160 visits. 
[05:07:00]  Right.  And he had this to say.  Oh, man, this is so intense!  Ed.  Yeah.  I'm listening.  Okay.  All right.  So, they arrest the guy.  Right.  And he had this to say to the police.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[05:07:30]  Now the line sucks.  No, I think you're looking for, uh...  What?  For this.  I'm over here now!  Are we done?  All right.  Well, no.  What did he say?  What did he say?  The chiropractor said...  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[05:08:00]  I'm trying to get to what he said.  All right.  Well, they went to his house.  They arrested the chiropractor.  All right.  The cops go over.  They arrest him.  We've gotten to that point.  You're such a dick.  Yeah.  And, uh, they, you know, were taken away in handcuffs.  Yeah.  And, uh, he said...  Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  All right. 
[05:08:30]  Look, look.  My hands are totally at my side.  Okay.  The chiropractor said...  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Two at a time.  Oops.  How about a presco?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  If I can, Anthony.  All right.  I'm not doing anything. 
[05:09:00]  Why is your hand on the button?  Look, look.  My hands are up.  Now the line sucks, but this is what he said.  Well, if it's what he actually said, then that's, uh, that's fine.
