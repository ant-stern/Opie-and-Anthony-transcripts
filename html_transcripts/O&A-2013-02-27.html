<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into a contentious interview between Sean Hannity and Congressman Keith Ellison.  The hosts played audio clips of the heated exchange, where Ellison vehemently criticized Hannity's journalistic integrity, accusing him of deceptive editing.  Ellison's refusal to engage in further debate with Hannity was a major point of discussion, prompting speculation on his political stances and potential accusations of racism due to his perceived aggressive demeanor.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing Pope Benedict XVI's unexpected resignation.  This led to a flurry of humorous and often crass speculation about the reasons behind his departure, including rumors of scandals involving his brother and even a boyfriend.  Their discussion covered the Pope's attire, the Catholic Church's structure and handling of past sex abuse scandals, the papal election process, and the mandatory celibacy of Catholic priests.  This segment included Jim Norton, along with Opie and Anthony.

Next, a college professor, Nicole, called in to discuss the backlash she faced after showing a clip from the HBO documentary *Mea Maxima Culpa* to her students.  The clip, depicting clerical abuse, caused distress among some students, leaving Nicole feeling guilty and apprehensive about her job security.  This sparked a debate about the historical context of clerical celibacy with a caller, Dave from Cleveland, who challenged Nicole's assertions about its origins.  Their argument escalated into a broader discussion about the Catholic Church's handling of child sexual abuse allegations, with Dave's minimizing comments provoking angry calls from listeners who shared their personal experiences with abusive priests. A clinical psychologist, Lydia, also called in to refute Dave's claims about psychological treatments in the 1970s.  This segment also included humorous bits about the Pope, a graphic promotion for Jim Norton's phone sex hotline, a brief call with Joe Piscopo, and a discussion of Kevin Hart's upcoming *Saturday Night Live* appearance and Opie's approach to raising his children religiously.

The show continued with a caller recounting a bizarre encounter near the Statue of Liberty, mistaking a mooring buoy for a submarine.  This transitioned into a discussion about the mushy texture of blueberries, followed by a discussion of a hot air balloon crash video showing survivors jumping from a burning balloon.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing and discussing songs by The Fifth Dimension, interspersed with anecdotes from the hosts' childhoods.  The show also featured a video of a pregnant woman fainting, a discussion of *Rocky III*, including its fashion and fight scenes, and a promotion for an eBay auction of signed Patrice O'Neal posters. Jim Jefferies contributed a "Masturbation Memories" segment, and a discussion of a sex tape involving Miss Teen Delaware ensued. The segment concluded with discussions of the hosts' upcoming comedy shows and a planned live broadcast in Boston, with another mention of Kevin Hart as an upcoming guest and Burt Young and Jason Trotsman as past guests.

A substantial interview with comedian Kevin Hart followed, promoting his upcoming *Saturday Night Live* appearance.  A significant portion of the interview focused on Hart's friend Wayne, his weight loss journey, and his transformation from a failed football player to a computer genius.  Hart shared stories about his gambling experiences, as did the hosts, mentioning other comedians like Keith Robinson and Tracy Morgan.  He also discussed his past unsuccessful SNL audition, his interactions with cast and writers, and his experiences playing in celebrity basketball games, including beating Usain Bolt in a race.  Wayne made a brief in-studio appearance during this segment.

The show concluded with Jim Norton's advice show, covering a wide range of listener calls.  Topics included a comedian's reluctance to appear on Howard Stern's show, a mother's frustration with an absent father, an aspiring stand-up comedian's fear of failure, a listener's question about a stand-up special's release, a stepfather's concern about his stepson's relationship, a husband's dilemma regarding his wife's permission to have sex with others, a caller who discovered his cousin is an escort, an inquiry about Comedy Cellar classes, a caller revealing a voyeuristic sex addiction, a listener's question about Jim Norton's stage persona, and a father's concern about his daughter's social difficulties.  The show ended with an advertisement for an auction benefiting Patrice O'Neal's family, and a discussion of oral sex and the product endorsement of Mask Sexual Flavors.

[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O and A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie and Anthony show.  With Opie and Anthony show.  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  I doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  I'm tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What is up? 
[00:05:30]  That's a very good question.  What is up?  It is.  It really is.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, there was a fight on Hannity last night.  Yeah.  Nice.  We got that audio?  I saw that.  I'm fucking...  Who's the guy that...  I saw your tweet.  Who is he?  What's his name?  I'm fucking...  Ebert?  Huh?  Yeah.  Keith?  Yeah, Keith Ellison.  Keith Ellison fought with Hannity.  He's some fucking Democratic lib from Montana. 
[00:06:00]  And Hannity was asking him questions.  And the guy took some issue with what Hannity...  How Hannity presented Obama before he spoke to Obama.  You know, it was like a little package piece at first with ominous music and stuff.  And you could say, absolutely, the guy had a point, you know, with how it's presented.  But that's the way this fucking newsertainment thing goes.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  But then, he got all pissy and had a hissy fit and wouldn't even fucking, like, have  an open, real dialogue about it.  He just wouldn't let Hannity talk.  He wouldn't let a dialogue of a question and answer go back and forth.  We get the same thing on this show when somebody, a caller just calls and it won't shut up.  Like, that's what he was doing.  And he's misrepresenting some of the stuff Sean was saying.  Wait, you call the radio show?  That's weird.  What?  Me?  I called.  I said wouldn't shut up. 
[00:07:00]  You said wouldn't shut up.  Oh, wouldn't shut up.  I'm like...  Yes.  Wait, you called the show?  Hey, I'm a great radio show calling.  Just ask Mancow.  Well, we do have the audio.  Fuck it.  Let's fuck with the hellos and the good mornings.  Yeah, we'll get right into this.  I'll get right into that, I gather.  I'd like a good morning.  A good morning?  So, Ellison calls Hannity the worst excuse for a journalist he's ever seen.  Yeah.  This is right after Hannity played in Obama's scare tactics.  Montage.  Mm-hmm.  And it's Congressman Keith Ellison, like you said. 
[00:07:30]  And here we go.  Joining me now with some insight, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota.  Congressman, welcome back, sir.  You bet.  I guess he's...  That's what...  Black guy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Which I said...  I just know black voices.  Yeah.  I don't know Keith Ellison.  You're not supposed to say that, though, that there's a black voice.  I know, but we all know.  I know.  You know black voices.  I published that magazine.  It sounds like a magazine.  Black voices. 
[00:08:00]  Black voices.  Remember the day we did this?  Yeah.  We picked a black voice every single time.  But you're not allowed or you're not supposed to do that?  No.  That was in the OJ trial.  Remember that?  Yeah, though, he couldn't tell a black voice or something.  Oh, and we did the bid, and we were...  I think we were 100%.  Yeah, it's pretty easy.  What we could describe as staying on message, something the Democratic Party, I would argue,  is very good at.  Let me ask you...  You're pretty good at it, too.  I...  Well, thank you.  I mean, you know, quite frankly, you are the worst excuse for a journalist I've ever seen. 
[00:08:30]  I am the worst.  I can't hear you.  You heard me.  I didn't know.  Say it again.  I didn't hear you.  He almost pulls a jimmy there.  I heard you.  I mean...  We heard you.  Yeah, right?  That would have been great.  We heard you.  Where is he talking from?  He's in some big fucking atrium of one of those legally-looking columns in granite places.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We got a few of those.  Yeah.  You heard me.  I didn't know.  Say it again.  I didn't hear you.  I heard you.  I mean, what you just displayed was not journalism.  It was yellow journalism. 
[00:09:00]  It wasn't anything close to trying to tell the American people what's really going on.  And, I mean, it's just shocking.  To yellow journalism?  To play Obama in his own words as yellow journalism?  Well, with the background music and with your lead-up before you let the president talk,  let me tell you, I was here.  Everything the president said is absolutely true.  And for you to try to make the American people think that it isn't is deceptive on your part.  And it's a breach of everything.  Every journalistic ethic I have ever heard of was just violated by you. 
[00:09:30]  And the president was truthful.  The president was honest.  What the president said was dead on accurate.  Drink it up.  And for you to say the president is to blame here is ridiculous.  It's about time, honey, he got a spanking.  I got to tell you.  I've been waiting for this fucking day.  He's not quite getting a spanking.  Oh, it gets ugly.  This guy looks silly if you ask me.  No, honey, he's getting a fucking talking to.  No.  I was there August 2011 when the Republicans, your party, which you shamelessly represent. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not a Republican.  Let me correct the record.  I hate when he says that, for real.  He's not.  I know.  He's conservative.  But he's a Republican.  He's a registered conservative.  It's a party.  It's a party.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  You could vote down the conservative line.  I mean, it's obviously akin to the Republican Party, a lot of the same candidates.  So is that a technicality?  There are differences.  No. 
[00:10:30]  He's being honest.  I'm not a Republican.  He says, I'm not a Republican.  I'm a registered conservative.  You know, whether you want to call it semantics or not, it's still honest.  Isn't that a sub-genre of the Republican Party?  I don't know what you'd call it.  I think I'd call it he's a registered conservative.  I think they part ways on a few issues.  I think Republicans, I think especially someone like Hannity probably thinks Republicans are  getting a little too fucking soft.  But he votes Republican, right? 
[00:11:00]  Right down the line.  He votes conservative ticket.  There's a conservative line, which is a lot of times the Republican candidate, but sometimes  it veers off to a conservative candidate.  Is it ever a Democrat?  No.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it a technicality?  No.  But if you vote down the conservative line, it's Republican every single time.  I don't think so.  I think there are cases where the conservative isn't.  But it's very rare, right? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, probably.  Are you a Republican or a conservative?  I'm a Republican.  So is the conservative like a third party?  No, it's kind of, it's like the fucking, you know, the, yeah, that religious right in  there and you get the fucking, you know, all these, um, kind of, uh, Christian value  things into the conservative party.  Well, because he's also said on our show that he's a moderate.  You believe that?  No, I don't think he's a moderate.  He has said that in the past.  Has he?  No.  Everyone thinks they're moderate. 
[00:12:00]  Very few people don't consider themselves moderate.  Most people think I'm reasonable.  Right.  Right.  Everyone thinks they're reasonable, but you know what?  Find me one person that's actually reasonable in this world.  There's not one.  No, I'm just trying to learn here today, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I mean, he's, he's telling the guy I'm not a Republican.  Like there's, there's this, this stigma that the fucking Democrats and this liberal cocksucker  wants to peg on people.  Oh, you're a Republican.  It's like, fuck you. 
[00:12:30]  No, conservative.  You know, fuck.  And this guy is such a fucking asshole anyway.  Fuck him.  Would you shamelessly represent?  Let me correct the record.  You are nothing but a Republican.  No, no.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Sir.  I'm a registered.  I am a registered.  Sir.  Well, let me just say.  I am not a registered Republican.  I'm a registered conservative.  You are a shill for the Republican Party.  I am a registered conservative, sir.  And you alibi them constantly. 
[00:13:00]  You alibi them 100% of the time.  Keep going.  You don't do anything else.  Okay, well, good.  Let me just say this.  What the president said is absolutely true.  The president.  The people watching your show should ignore all of the commentary that you put in and  all of the hype music that you put on and should pay attention to what the president  actually said.  Because what the president said was true.  Well, they go with like ominous music and stuff.  Yeah.  But every news fucking station does all that shit.  The bottom line is this fucking president is not taking responsibility for anything. 
[00:13:30]  And the fucking, his people, his fucking flock will not for a second call him out on anything.  It's astounding.  So now again, we're heading toward another economic fucking bullshit session.  And this motherfucker won't even discuss cuts.  He talks about more taxes.  We already had our taxes go up the first of the year. 
[00:14:00]  And now this motherfucker's again talking about revenue.  Are these brand new taxes?  Yes, of course they are.  And I started hearing, it's not even two months later, and I'm hearing fucking fair share again?  This fuck?  It might be time to leave this country.  Oh.  Where do you want to go?  God, I wish.  France.  I wish I could.  Oh.  Never go to France.  No, what about like some nice Caribbean island?  No, because there's nothing better out there. 
[00:14:30]  Believe me.  There's no better fucking place to really go and, you know, get a job and fucking whatever.  So we got to deal with this fucking horse shit and have Kool-Aid drinkers like this piece of shit from Montana  who will not call him out on anything.  No one.  No one.  What has this president done positive for this country?  The economy's still in the shitter.  They're still blaming Bush.  The fucking unemployment is still as low as it's been. 
[00:15:00]  It's fucking.  You mean as high as it's been.  Well, the employment's been as low.  Sorry.  Yeah, unemployment's been as high as it's been.  He's fucking, he's not doing anything.  Isn't the stock market doing better?  Stock market is no indicator of the economy.  Believe me.  It's no indicator of the economy.  The stock market doing well proves that there's nowhere else to put your fucking money.  You can't put it in the banks. 
[00:15:30]  You don't want to invest it in the country because the country fucking broke.  16 trillion in debt.  Six of which came under this guy's tenure.  Enough.  You just threw six more trillion at the debt?  Oh, no, no.  Like it was nothing?  It went from 10 to 16?  Yeah, and this fucking, these people will never fucking say that he has any, any responsibility  for it.  It's always something else.  It's the Republicans that are holding him back. 
[00:16:00]  It's fucking what he inherited.  Well, you're in your second term, motherfucker.  How about something kicks up?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Drink it up.  That's what I say, my friends.  I'm quoting my, my song from Drew Boogie.  We'll play it for you.  Wow.  He said the whole, the whole process is, has become exhausting, though.  Yeah, well, it is.  They just can't get anything fucking done. 
[00:16:30]  No, and, and, and, and we always, everyone blames the fucking Republicans because, you  know, you get the liberal cunt fucking news.  I blame both sides.  And, and, and then you see a guy like that was on Hannity last night, this motherfucker,  that won't even open a dialogue on a talk show about, about, about the host.  But never mind a dialogue with a, a Republican about how, how we should fucking not spend  so much money.  He looked, he looked bad doing that, though.  He looked like an asshole.  This guy looks like an idiot doing this.  He doesn't, he doesn't look like he's collecting himself, but he looks like, he looks like a dummy. 
[00:17:00]  Does he look like a guy that can sit down with somebody he might not agree with and have  an open discussion for a constructive fucking, uh, end?  No, no, I can think of a lot of people that don't.  But I think he's the norm down there.  I really do.  Who the hell is norm?  It continues.  We ended up with some, let me ask you a question.  I've given you plenty.  I've given you plenty.  I've given you plenty.  I've given you plenty.  I could rant.  And I am.  See, right about here is where your point is made, sir.  Oh, boy.  Because now Hannity, you know, he let him rant.  Yeah.  And now Hannity wants to ask him a question. 
[00:17:30]  I, I know how this ends, so.  Yeah.  You know, this is where you're absolutely fucking right.  Guy ranted for three straight minutes.  Hannity goes, all right, go.  Right.  And the guy got his point across.  He was not making any new points.  He was reiterating everything he said in this three-minute rant that he went on.  And then Hannity goes, all right, let me ask you a question.  And this fucking guy will not even entertain a back and forth with Sean Hannity.  Never mind, he's going to sit there with a Republican he doesn't agree with about budget cuts.  No, he's a fucking piece of shit who is holding us hostage. 
[00:18:00]  The problem is no one listens anymore.  What?  Exactly.  We ended up with sequestered.  All right, let me ask you a question.  I've given you plenty.  He said I could rant, and I am.  I've given you plenty of time to rant, Congressman.  Now, now it's, sir.  We'll let you get a word in.  Go ahead.  Oh, you're so nice to give me a word on my own program.  Okay, I changed my mind.  Let me ask you a question.  And he goes, I changed my mind.  Let me ask you.  You said the president.  Well, that's kind of funny.  That was funny.  I did laugh at that one.  All right.  He's like, oh, thank you for giving me a chance to talk on my own show.  Well, now I changed my mind. 
[00:18:30]  I'm not going to let you talk.  Hannity should have cut his audio.  Yeah, yeah.  Hannity should have just cut his audio.  Hannity comes across as a nice guy in general, but you don't want to push him.  It's his show.  He knows how it's run.  He's done it for years.  He's obviously in what they call the driver's seat.  Let me ask you a question.  As a matter of fact.  Let me ask you.  Let me ask you.  You said the president was true.  Congressman, come up.  I will give you your chance.  I gave you three minutes to rant.  Calm down.  I gave you three minutes.  Relax.  I'm going to question for you.  By the way, could you pause for a second? 
[00:19:00]  When this really does pick up some steam and more news agencies get a hold of this, he  will absolutely be called a racist by certain people.  I don't think?  Yeah.  Yes, he will.  For saying, calm down.  That will be looked at as talking down to a black man.  And then he says that he's angry.  That again.  And this isn't based on me thinking these wacky thoughts that I think.  This is based on past performance of liberals, Democrats, blacks in the media will absolutely 
[00:19:30]  say, oh my God, oh, calm down.  Whoa, this conjures up the old image of the wild, crazy black man.  Abso-fucking-lutely someone's going to bring that up.  I don't even think this will get picked up by the nation.  It probably won't because it's, you know, they don't want to promote Fox.  But there'll be some, then there'll be some fucking blog assholes or some peripheral  media.  Well, I hope so because this racism has to end.  It really does, Jimmy.  You were invited on the program to answer a question. 
[00:20:00]  I want to give you a couple of questions.  You said, you said, Congressman, Congressman, let me ask you a question.  Why are you so angry?  You're so angry.  Let me ask you a question.  I'm not angry.  I'm laughing at you because I think this is actually comical.  I'm laughing at you.  All right.  Here's my question.  Here's my question for you.  And it's not the first time.  Listen, I invited you on.  I gave you three minutes to rant.  Now let me ask you a question.  We'll have a discussion.  We'll have a dialogue.  In the spirit of bipartisanship, let's find a dialogue.  I want to ask you this.  I thought you weren't a Republican. 
[00:20:30]  Max, I'm a registered conservative.  I am.  Sir, you want to make a thousand dollar bet that I'm a registered conservative?  You want to make a ten thousand dollar bet?  I don't bet.  I don't bet.  It's just degenerated into a, I'll bet you.  It all of a sudden became the school ground.  The congressman's being a cunt.  He is being a cunt.  He's being a cunt.  He's being a bit obtuse.  Yeah.  Obtuse?  And then it continues, this last bit of it here.  So Barack Obama said in 2008 when he was running for office that George Bush was irresponsible 
[00:21:00]  and unpatriotic for, when he became president, we had $10 trillion in debt.  We now have $16 trillion in debt, congressman.  I'm here to speak for myself.  $16 trillion in debt.  I want to ask you, is it?  Can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Why is it up to $16 trillion?  Why the six?  Add it to it.  It was $19 trillion, but someone stole the nine.  Yuck. 
[00:21:30]  It was $10 before Obama came in.  Is that a fact?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now it's up to $16.  So where's that $6 trillion?  What was it used for?  It certainly does seem to depend on who you ask.  Okay.  The war effort?  Yeah.  The war obviously cost a lot of money.  But Obama does not have any concept on how to cut the budget and sensibly fucking, you know, whittle down the spending in Washington. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, but all he wants to do is tax, tax, tax, which won't even come close to making a dent in a fraction of the debt.  But why did it go from $10 to $16?  Where's that money?  It's spending.  Spending on what?  Entitlement programs are huge in this country right now.  Obama's administration is spending like a maniac on entitlement programs, which do nothing more but get votes from his constituency, who absolutely love free shit. 
[00:22:30]  Love it!  Is this guy a Democrat or is he, uh, is this guy a Democrat, the, uh...  Oh, yeah.  I thought he was something else.  From the state that brought you fucking Jesse Ventura and Al Franken.  Ow!  You want to talk about what I want to ask you?  You want to do something about that?  Here's my question.  I got an answer for you.  You want to do something about the $16 trillion?  Let's do something.  Let's close loopholes on large corporations.  Let's say that yachts and jets should not be something you can write up. 
[00:23:00]  Let's say that ExxonMobil and Chevron should not get a tax rebate and a subsidy.  Let's start there.  Let's say that people who are...  Start there?  How about start a cutting?  All right, Congressman, you're ranting really well.  Can I ask you a question?  Here's a simple question.  Is it immoral?  But you're a woman, Sean.  Here's my question.  Is it immoral?  Is it immoral to put 16 and a half...  I'm immoral? 
[00:23:30]  What did I do that's immoral?  I didn't do anything that's immoral.  You say things that aren't true.  Give me one example, sir.  Well, to try to say that it is the president's fault and he is to blame is wrong.  And it's a lie.  It's not his fault that we have $16 trillion in debt?  He didn't add $6 trillion in debt?  No, it isn't.  We didn't add $6 trillion to the debt since he's been president?  No, no.  No, we did add $6 trillion to debt since he's been president.  Let's talk about the other 10.  All right.  Let's talk about the other 10.  That came from George Washington on, dummy.  I'm moving on because our audience deserves better. 
[00:24:00]  Thank you for being with us.  I tried to give you a fair shot.  And coming up...  Wow, he cut him off.  Good.  And Hannity says he doesn't use that word, huh?  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing how cool Hannity was?  He really could have just carried on and held a dialogue after that, even if he was annoyed.  Yeah.  Maybe known it made good TV, but that's a professionalism to that that I couldn't do.  He knows.  He knows what he's got to do for his show, for the network, you know, and to be fucking, 
[00:24:30]  you know, who he is on that show.  So he knows it's a show.  Does that part about that whole thing?  Keith Ellison unfollowed Hannity on Twitter after that.  Did he?  Yeah.  But you know what will happen?  It's really awkward for everybody.  It's terrible.  They'll talk after.  Oh.  There'll be a bunch of cunts on a message board that agree because they don't know what  they're talking about.  But, yeah, we talked after.  We're all good.  You're all good with Colin?  Yeah.  How could anyone even have an issue with Colin Quinn? 
[00:25:00]  Well, it's not that hard.  Oh, okay.  Colin, people forget that because Colin is brilliant and funny, he's also a fucking nutty comic,  too.  Yes.  Like, these dummies, what do you think?  The Colin is like, they're like, oh, dude, he was trolling.  No, he wasn't.  No, no, no.  That wasn't trolling.  Idiots.  That wasn't trolling.  Oh, that was a real issue yesterday.  People ask me if that was like a shtick or a bit or something.  I'm like, no, those are two friends, obviously, and, you know, people in the same business talking.  But the issue wasn't about Twitter. 
[00:25:30]  No.  It's amazing how people think it was about Twitter, but it really wasn't.  People don't know.  No.  But I have, in fairness to the dummies.  Colin Quinn is a national treasure.  Who's out from fucking CQ on Pal Talk.  That's hilarious.  But there was a lot of things I couldn't say yesterday, which had zero to do with Colin.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  People are going to...  But it's amazing how people can hear the same thing I hear and take a totally different...  Yeah.  It's hard not to get angry at that, but I'm like...  You just described human nature. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, people hear the same thing and take a completely different conclusion.  Of course.  That happens all the fucking time.  And I went after this one guy, because he's always been kind of a cunt on the message board.  What message board?  Well, don't even mention that.  Yeah, that's why I was...  I haven't been to a message board in years.  What's a message board?  Well, you know, once in a while...  I've gotten links before, and I mean, I obviously know it's there, but...  And I usually don't check them.  Sometimes I do.  Right.  But, you know, people just like to get you stirred up, and sometimes it works.  Yeah.  But, uh... 
[00:26:30]  Whatever.  You know which one I mean.  And I smashed him on Twitter.  Like, a private message.  Because he was kind of a douche.  And I look back on what he had written, and I'm like, eh, maybe it's not a bunch of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm looking, and he's just a fat guy with a picture in front of a Batmobile.  Oh!  And I'm like, this is the...  This fucking jizz bag?  He just...  Some people, they don't deserve to have a fucking say in the matter.  But, I mean, why would I let that annoy me?  I don't know why I would even get annoyed and fucking... 
[00:27:00]  It's like, he's just a little fat kid who wants to sound like he's in the know.  Ugh.  Aw, meat rock.  Aw.  All right, so that's how we start today, with the Hannity fight.  Yes.  That was nice, huh?  I'm still confused by the Republican versus the conservative, like, as far as a party goes.  I really am.  There are differences.  There are definitely differences.  Not a lot of differences, though.  The Republican party line.  Right.  And the conservative line.  No, I know.  I get...  I understand that part of it, but it really seems like it's under the Republican umbrella, though. 
[00:27:30]  Well, obviously, more so than the Democratic umbrella.  I can't think of one that is Democratic.  Name one Democrat that's conservative.  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  I wouldn't know.  Well, conservative Democrat for a Democrat.  Clinton was, like, a conservative Democrat for a Democrat.  Like, but...  You know what I mean?  That's...  Fiscally conservative?  Yeah, they're, uh... 
[00:28:00]  Lieberman?  I hate that.  There's more conservative-leaning guys, but there's no such thing as a true conservative Democrat.  Lieberman, maybe?  Yeah, of course.  Is that...  People coming up with Lieberman?  This guy's saying here.  Didn't he switch parties, too?  Hell, Lieberman.  He switched parties, right, Lieberman?  Yeah, he went, what, Libertarian or some shit?  I don't know what he did.  Whatever.  Or, more importantly...  That's what he did.  More importantly, the Pope is, uh, stepping down.  What are they doing over there at the Vatican today?  It's all over our TVs.  I think they carted him around.  He looks pretty healthy to me. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  If those are live pictures, he looks pretty fucking healthy.  He looks pretty good.  He doesn't look like, uh, John Paul did at the end of his life.  My God, John Paul was like...  He looked like a melting...  Man.  A melting person.  Just a croaking fucking monster.  It's so obvious something's coming.  Yeah, I agree.  Something is coming.  But, you know, and they wanted him out immediately before whatever hits hits.  His brother, something with his brother might be happening?  I heard something with his brother.  Really?  Yes.  His brother was involved in some kind of a sexual...  This is what I heard, uh, that the Pope covered up when he was... 
[00:29:00]  When he was Cardinal Ratzenberger, before he got his red shoes and his fucking new title.  Wow, do I dislike this guy.  Yeah.  His ruby red shoes.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Three times and go home.  I heard something with his brother, too.  I mean, what are we allowed to say?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could speculate, uh, of the S.  Well...  And that might just be it.  I have an insider that's been writing me.  You want me to read what he wrote me?  Okay.  Is this...  We could do this, right?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  He goes, uh...  I'm not going to give his, uh, his Twitter name.  Uh, he writes, some damaging abuse shit is going to come out about the Pope's brother.  Oh.  And, uh, the Pope covered it up before he was Pope, so he had to resign, because that's  now coming out.  You think?  That's what this guy's saying.  And I...  So then I kind of, like, pushed this guy, who's...  Who's credible to begin with?  So I pushed him a little bit, and he writes, uh, that's what I'm hearing.  Uh, I'll just say this, uh, someone very close to me, meaning this guy, uh, was one 
[00:30:00]  of the three attorneys in Boston who negotiated the $85 million abuse settlement a few years  ago.  So this guy is very close to, you know, one of the lawyers that was involved in that.  And then I wrote him again, and then he wrote, the Pope supposedly has a boyfriend who  follows him around everywhere.  So I told Ant that this morning.  I thought that was pretty funny.  As we're watching the coverage, we're trying to figure out which one it is.  Which one in the Popemobile is the boyfriend, you know? 
[00:30:30]  You see him driving around, you see some young bucks in there, maybe he's got a chippy.  That's where that...  That's where the guy loses me a little bit, because I don't, I don't know how you cover  up having a boyfriend if you're the Pope living at the Vatican.  Explain how you could do that.  Pretty easy, probably.  They all, because everybody knows, like, you don't, you're probably not making out in front  of people.  You know, he's a close aide, Pope probably could have alone time with anybody he wants.  Close aide to discuss, you know, it's probably someone that legitimately works with him.  Right.  That wouldn't shock me at all. 
[00:31:00]  You look at this guy, his mannerisms.  John Paul, I didn't get that vibe from it all.  Yeah.  This guy, from the minute, from the minute he started yapping, I'm like, this seems like  a gay man to me.  Well, the ruby red shoes.  Could you find the ruby red shoes there, Sam Roberts, please?  Please, I beg you.  Well, we'll see.  I mean, he lost me on that a little bit with the boyfriend.  Yeah.  But you never know.  But just what a fucking horrible organization. 
[00:31:30]  Look at his shoes.  Look at these shoes.  It really is ridiculous.  Look at these red shoes.  What kind of shoes are those?  They protect pedophiles and bash homosexuals, and that's what the guy who runs the whole organization  walks around in.  You would swear those are girl shoes.  They are.  You would swear those are women's shoes for an older woman.  They really do kind of look girly, right?  It's embarrassing.  I mean, you could almost say, no, they're guy shoes, almost.  But, man, they certainly look like old lady shoes.  Your holiness. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at these shoes.  They look so stupid.  It's stupid.  Oh, God.  This is my religion by birth, man.  It's embarrassing.  It's just terrible.  I hate organized religion.  I'm just not a fan of it.  Is that a real hat, Sam?  Or is that a joke?  No, that's his...  He wore that red hat, too, man.  The hat.  Look at the hat.  It's a pulp hat.  He looks like Brando on the island of Dr. Moreau.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, that's pretty bad, man.  That's an old lady's hat.  Yeah.  From one of those clubs, the Red Hat Club or whatever it's called.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Those women that go out with the red hats.  And they hang out and do some red hat shit.  Red hats.  They all go and, you know, take in a show and then take in lunch somewhere.  The red hat.  Yeah.  So the coverage is all over the TV.  They're just kind of carting him around in the Popemobile right now.  And then tomorrow's his last day, right? 
[00:33:00]  Enjoy.  Tomorrow, yeah.  Yeah.  But we only found out about this two weeks ago.  Yeah.  They are pushing this guy out quick.  Yeah.  They're just giving him the heave-ho.  Yeah, Pop, Pop, Pop.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  So then what happens?  Something hits and then they go, well, look, he's not the Pope anymore.  And they're hoping that'll help the situation?  Yeah, I don't know how that works.  Or does anything-  What does the situation have to do with it?  Or does anything ever come out?  Was there a backroom deal that was made?  Saying, look, we'll be cool if you get rid of this fucking guy. 
[00:33:30]  Get him out of there.  Ah, maybe.  Because we're all religious people over here and this is fucking hurting everybody.  So, you know, we're going to release this shit unless you get rid of him immediately.  That would be kind of fucked up.  Maybe.  And then that means we never hear anything.  Yeah.  Because that backroom deal shit happens all the time.  Maybe they said, get rid of this fucking ghoulish old lady.  You remember when you were a kid, you couldn't picture talking bad about the Pope.  Like, when I was a kid, I couldn't picture, A, feeling zero respect for the office. 
[00:34:00]  You were scared that you would go to hell or something.  Yeah, you thought this was a special guy.  Right.  In a handbag.  A loving guy or a special guy.  And then he's just not.  No.  I told that, you know, now having kids and stuff, I go to church a little more than I used to.  Because, you know, there's this and that.  And, you know, you got other family members that, you know, might believe more and stuff.  You know, it's a balancing act.  Yeah.  And, uh, which I fully accept and understand. 
[00:34:30]  But, uh, every time I see a priest, though, I just, ugh.  You get the heebie-jeebies.  There's not one priest I've seen in the last, I don't know, I've been going to church more, more, not a lot, to be honest with you.  But in the last, let's call it five years.  Every time I see a priest, I just get, just, ugh.  I almost want to go get a shower immediately.  A little creeped out.  They're all creepy to me at this point.  Black priests don't gross, white priests gross me out.  For some reason, I don't associate the pedos with anything but white priests. 
[00:35:00]  Maybe just because I haven't seen enough of them.  Every face I've seen has been a white priest who's done it.  I'm sure there's plenty of the other, Asian or black or Spanish, but I haven't seen them.  Right.  So there's awful atrocities.  A lot of minority priests, I see.  They don't creep me out.  As much?  No, because I don't associate them with the pedophilia scandal.  Because I haven't seen enough of them arrested.  Like, I've only seen white faces attached to the scandal, so that's, I see these white  priests and I'm like, oh, you fucking creep.  And then I go way back when I was, you know, just an innocent boy growing up in Centiport. 
[00:35:30]  I wonder about our priest.  Oh, dear.  Oh, please.  If he was molesting, you had to be first on the list.  Oh, no, no.  I don't mean it like that.  I just seen your little plump bottom running up the apple tree.  But he was so trusting our priest, and you just wonder what really was going on.  Yeah.  Was our priest clean?  There had to be some clean ones out there, right?  There's just something that goes along with not getting married, not having a relationship  with women.  You're just, you're pulling your priests from fucking a crop that already has an issue with 
[00:36:00]  sexuality.  Well, it goes against human nature, too.  You got the urges as a man, as a man, as a woman, and you're basically told to ignore  those urges.  It's impossible.  Just a man.  Name's Fred.  Are they allowed to jerk off, at least?  No, you're not supposed to.  No, you can't spill that fucking precious seed.  That's impossible as a human.  Even Nagel doesn't waste the fucking Nagel seed. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  No, he baggies it up and he sells it on eBay.  Takes that shit home with him.  They called it golden loads.  Unless they castrate these guys or something, it's impossible.  So, of course, you're going to have problems.  If you have other religions, they allow them to marry.  Do you know what priests I like?  This priest had met on sober retreats.  Like, those guys who were recovering, because I would listen to them speak.  Really?  But they would talk like everybody else I knew who was recovering, and they would tell stories.  They were honest.  They were just talking about, you know, being drunks, and some of them would talk about 
[00:37:00]  having sex with girls.  It was very interesting to hear them talk as recovering.  I remember one guy telling a story about how he was conducting a wedding and he vomited  on the bride.  Like, there was some really funny shit.  Wow, really?  That's pretty fucking bad right there.  Like, you have another dumb drunk.  Like, it was very, very entertaining when you hear these guys be human.  I can't even imagine my priests growing up being drunks.  Can't even imagine it.  I'm sure they were.  I'm sure a few of them were.  Yeah.  A lot more than you think.  A lot more.  I mean, just the guilt you have growing up Catholic. 
[00:37:30]  Can you imagine being a priest and the guilt you feel knowing you're banged abroad or you're  drinking or you're jerking off or you're touching a little boy?  Imagine that guilt you have to deal with while you're falling asleep at night.  Oh, dear.  When all that shit plays in your mind.  Yeah.  When the day is done and you're laying there by yourself.  Looking up at the ceiling.  Looking at the crucifix on the wall.  Oh, man.  I can't even imagine having that type of guilt.  Holy fuck.  Do you think they have the guilt, though, man?  Or do they just wash it away somehow? 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  I think you have to.  I'm sure there are some that certainly just wash it away.  Deep down, they have to.  Or do they go to one of their friends and get absolved?  I'm talking about the guys that they absolutely feel it.  You know there's some guys that they're like, fuck, I'll touch a hundred boys and it's not  even going to fucking bother me one iota.  But there's definitely guys you've got to thank.  They're feeling some brutal guilt because they're falling asleep at night.  And they've given a bad name to a lot of, there's a lot of good people, obviously, in  the church.  And a lot of, like they do so much charity work and they do a lot for the poor. 
[00:38:30]  You know, the majority of Catholics and Christians are very good people.  It's just the organization itself.  It's not about the people that I get so irritated.  It's this part of the organization, the way they've handled.  If they would have just outed it and had these pedophile pigs arrested, I would have tremendous  respect for them.  Yeah.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of guys that really want to speak out, but, you know, they're  scared.  You know, they're trying to protect the religion itself at this point.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  So what do you do?  To make this huge announcement, you know, it really makes your organization look real shitty.  I was, you know, who's brought this church to their knees to it?  Lawyers.  Right.  The only way to fight, this is where lawyers are actually really good.  Just fucking soak them for that gold.  Dude, the fucking lawyers are the only thing.  This is where you have to stick up for the lawyers.  They're the only recourse we have.  Yeah.  And I tell you, you know, they're going to pick a new pope and this is impossible. 
[00:39:30]  I know, but they got to get a real young guy in there.  I think that would, that would help.  I don't think they ever do that because they don't want someone to have that power for that  long.  But you, you know, you see these old guys and you just feel like they're all connected  to it somehow in some way.  They all know something.  Yeah.  And it seems like the younger guys, you know, they're starting to clean it up a little bit  where at least you can't get away with murder.  So a younger guy probably isn't as connected to it.  Maybe. 
[00:40:00]  Maybe.  Yeah.  But that's not going to happen.  You're going to see another fucking old guy coming forward in a couple of weeks.  Old fossil pope.  Yeah.  Did you, um, did you hear how they picked the new pope?  Like how involved it is?  No, you got a bunch of the bishops there, right?  And the cardinals, I mean.  The cardinals.  And then they, uh.  But they vote and then they have to put their vote on, um, through a needle onto a string.  Did you?  How did they do it?  They broke it down on the news the other day and it took, I think it took about 10 
[00:40:30]  straight minutes of them explaining how they do this.  It was pretty fascinating.  All in favor, say aye.  But just to make sure.  Bring on the boys.  Just to make sure that there's not double votes or anything.  Everyone's vote goes through a needle onto a string so they could all see the votes.  Oh.  And then they pick guys to be the committee to count the votes.  And then if that vote doesn't give you a new pope, they start all over again.  But they get a new committee to count the votes.  It's really pretty complicated. 
[00:41:00]  Do you have the steps?  There's probably been some issues over the years.  Like 500 years ago, there was probably one that got in there.  Like, I don't, we don't know what happened.  A bunch of hands went up.  Right, right.  And the next thing you know, there's 10 dead cardinals and that guy's elected.  Yeah, exactly.  But the whole process was pretty fascinating when they explained it about a week or so ago.  I should have wrote down some of the other things they do.  But it's, yeah, it's not just a quick vote.  When is this happening?  I don't know.  They start right away, right? 
[00:41:30]  I think so, once everybody gets there.  So who's the pope in between popes?  They got a vice president pope?  Do they have a vice pope?  They got a VP?  They got the Joe Biden of the Catholic Church?  Or a speaker of the house.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a speaker of the house guy.  They're calling this pope now emeritus pope.  Emeritus pope.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Because they haven't had to, you know, do this that many times.  Right.  So that's his title now.  He still has a title.  He still gets to wear all the clothes.  The pope clothes. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  But he's not, you know, the pope.  Where does he go?  He ain't no fucking pope.  Where does he go?  He wasn't planning on going to some villa on a mountainside somewhere.  He was planning on dying in that place.  Yeah, where does the pope go when he's been fucking, you know.  How does that work?  Not shunned, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Close enough.  You know, this is one of those situations, you hear it all the time, where we accept his  resignation.  Yeah.  But it's like, in the back room, you're sat down, and they go, okay, you can leave on 
[00:42:30]  your own with a little pride, or we're going to fire you next week.  It's up to you how this ends.  Well, it's like a radio statement they put out.  The pope, for different creative endeavors.  Yeah, exactly.  All that bullshit.  He probably doesn't want to leave.  Why would you want to leave that gig?  Every moment of your day is taken care of.  Yeah.  Unless he felt it would be better, like, I know what's coming.  Maybe you were right, dude.  There might have been something back door, like.  Some kind of deal saying, look.  Get this fucker out of here. 
[00:43:00]  If you get him out, then we'll settle down.  I don't know.  We'll settle down.  We'll see.  It just seems, obviously, for everyone listening, it's extremely suspicious.  Yeah, it is.  First time in 600 years?  Yeah, something's up.  Something big is up.  Something's up, yo.  Mm-hmm.  I hope they liked the black pope.  I hope it's that guy from Ghana.  Yeah, I do.  What's with you?  Because they've never been one.  And there's also.  That doesn't necessarily mean good.  But look where they've gotten, like, look at what's happening now. 
[00:43:30]  So a black pope couldn't do any worse.  And they're in so many third world countries.  It's like, they've been going into third world countries for all these years.  Why not?  All right.  Let's make everyone black.  Let's just do that.  Everyone in any position of power, just make them all black.  Because certain cultures that are run by black leadership and black majorities have just done so well over the globe.  When you look at exclusively black culture around the globe, it's always just so successful. 
[00:44:00]  Well, maybe not.  But when you look at the fact that the big pope's Catholicism is now looked at as a child-fucking haven.  Like, there's no way they could have done a worse job of handling this.  If they came out with kid-fucking-videos, it would have been more respected for the honesty of it.  Like, this is where their best thinking got them.  Billions of dollars in lawsuits.  Yeah, they tried their best to just cover up the whole thing.  And they've paid out billions of dollars, and it doesn't even hurt the organization.  No. 
[00:44:30]  And as much as black...  Which is pretty amazing to me, because it's supposed to be about helping your fellow human being.  And they're holding on to a shitload of money.  A shitload.  And I was scared to tell you about black leaders when I went to the circus recently.  Yeah?  The ringleader is now black.  Is he?  Yeah.  All right.  That's cool.  What are you going to do?  Well, blacks are not perfect, but let's be honest, they're not associated as much with being pedophiles as white guys. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  There's no way to get to a fucking...  No one looks at a black leader and thinks kid-fucker.  You might think other things, but you don't think kid-fucker.  That's not typically what you think.  And when you want to see the Popemobile all pimped out, let's be honest with each other.  That would just be amazing.  I can only imagine the type of rims on that model.  Now, I'm with you.  That vehicle, all right?  For a comic, that would be a dream come true.  No kidding.  Black Pope would be pretty good for...  But it would be almost hack.  What I said is hack.  I do know that.  I know that joke's been done a million fucking times. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  But you could certainly go with that concept if you have a black Pope.  I thought my tweet about how he'd already have his fucking...  His own purple robes was rather clever.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot to retweet that one.  I better retweet it right now.  That was a while ago.  You never know when you don't...  I've got to retweet everything Jimmy writes now.  No, only if I request...  Oh, yeah.  People...  It's funny.  People...  Me and I looked at each other.  We panicked yesterday.  No, no, no.  But I wasn't saying people should retweet me.  I was saying when I shot a special...  I'm just kidding. 
[00:46:00]  No, no, I know.  But I want to clarify that, too, because I forgot to mention this earlier.  When I shot a special...  I never asked people helping me promote, like other comics.  When I shot a special, I asked for help.  Could you please retweet this?  Because the more people that went and saw it, the better it was for me.  And when people that you are friends with kind of ignore that request, you're like,  what the fuck would I have helped this person for when I ask them one time to do something  and they don't do it?  You got the...  I never know how to say your name. 
[00:46:30]  Belineski.  He's a good one on Twitter.  He writes, all Catholic priests were allowed to get married years ago.  Oh, yeah?  But the Roman Catholics changed it so the wives couldn't get money from the church when  the priest died.  Yeah, I've heard it was overpowering.  Just to save fucking money?  But that caused all sorts of issues.  It certainly did.  You can't have a man, you know, trying to hold all his sperm inside.  It's impossible.  I mean, the biology of man makes it impossible. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  But is that true, though?  Because are they really, in those other countries, concerned about spouse?  Isn't that more of an American thing?  I don't know.  This guy's usually pretty good for info, so that's why I just went with it.  I mean, we can certainly look it up.  And then, yeah, the Orthodox Catholic priests do get married and have kids, yes.  Yes, I do know that.  Here are the steps for the vote-tallying procedure.  You want to read this, Sam?  Yeah, sure.  Steps for the vote-tallying procedure.  They broke it down. 
[00:47:30]  It made it a little easier here than what I saw on TV, I think.  So this is after the vote's made.  So you write down the name on a ballot.  Right.  Right?  Okay.  Then you give it to the first scrutineer.  Scrutineer!  Listen to this, though.  I want to be a scrutineer.  They're not fucking around.  Scrutineer.  How do you become a scrutineer?  You're a scrutineer.  Ah, good one.  I know.  And by the way, really fast before we move on from it, supposedly the Pope will stay  in the Vatican.  Really?  Yeah, well, I heard he was going somewhere else.  They don't want him out there yapping. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  They're going to keep him in a fucking dungeon.  He's in lockup.  He's going to be in lockup?  Oh, yeah.  So the first scrutineer takes a ballot, notes the name on it, and passes it to the next  scrutineer.  The second scrutineer notes the name and passes it to the third scrutineer.  This might be the committee.  The third scrutineer reads aloud the name on the ballot, pierces the ballot with a needle  through the word Eligo at the top of the ballot, and slides the ballot onto a string 
[00:48:30]  of thread.  Each elector notes the name that is read.  Once all ballots are read, the scrutineers write down the official count on a separate  sheet of paper.  Yeah.  The third scrutineer ties the ends of the thread on which the ballots are placed in  a knot to preserve the vote.  The ballots are placed in a receptacle.  How about they get a fucking laptop?  How about that?  Everything's outdated with that organization. 
[00:49:00]  A string with a fucking notebook.  Just get Excel.  Sharpie.  Yeah, get something.  Excel.  And then if they don't elect the Pope, obviously they burn the ballots, and that's when you  get the different type of smoke.  Right.  They add in a chemical to make the smoke black.  Right.  What if you forget to add that chemical?  Oh, then you look stupid.  And you only do that every...  It's like you'd think you'd have everything down.  Right.  Yeah.  Instead of the smoke, how about the guy who just comes out, how about they send out a  press release or a tweet?  Got it.  Yep.  It's done.  Pope Jerry, we said no to. 
[00:49:30]  Pope Jerry.  So Pope Hank got the gig.  We all love holding on to tradition.  That's why.  Yeah.  It's all about tradition.  Let's see.  Staying in the Vatican so that he won't be prosecuted.  What?  How is...  Oh, it's because it's another country, technically.  Derek, what do you know about that, sir?  Well, the Vatican is its own sovereign country.  Right.  And he will never leave that place ever again in case anything comes out, because if he leaves  it, he will get prosecuted for whatever he did, and you can't have that as a pope or 
[00:50:00]  a former pope.  It would really tear down the Catholic Church.  So...  If a pope goes to jail.  So let's say he murders someone, but he's in this Vatican country, let's call it.  Yeah.  You can't get at him to bring him up on murder charges?  No.  They'll never get at him.  They won't allow it.  How crazy is that?  It would be crazy if the pope murdered someone.  No, of course.  I mean, you know, without...  Whatever crime.  They're like, look, he fucking committed a crime.  We got to go get him.  Yeah.  How do you do that? 
[00:50:30]  Well, do you?  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They'll got to go in there like the Mossad.  Fucking pluck him out.  Yeah.  The pope will be...  He'll be dead within the year.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll poison him.  Oh, yeah.  They'll poison him?  Oh, yeah.  No, not by...  Keep his yap shut?  No, because it's just...  Thank you, sir.  The whole thing is really creepy, because he...  They say he's retiring because of old age or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  We're seeing him on TV today.  He looks absolutely fine.  They've talked to people that have basically said he's fine. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  They don't know of any medical issues whatsoever.  But they throw it out there because of old, you know, advancing age.  Yeah.  They keep him in the Vatican.  And then we'll have a little news story pop up one morning while we're sitting here.  You know, the old pope is now dead.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And then it goes back to, well, we told you he was not, you know, feeling that well, that  he was getting up there and had medical issues.  It's too creepy for me.  Who's the guy that's got to poison the pope? 
[00:51:30]  I'm sure they freaking...  Yeah.  They're chomping at the bit to do it.  Some of those ghouls.  Me!  Knows why priests can't get married.  Didn't we do this one?  I thought we did.  Let's say hi to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to clarify something that somebody said earlier about why priests can't get married.  Okay.  Malachi Martin wrote a book about 20 years ago.  He's a priest.  He was a priest.  Basically, the guy was somewhat right. 
[00:52:00]  Basically, priests can't get married because if you're married, you have to have money to  keep your family together.  And priests were giving away deaconships and whatever because, you know, just for the want  of money.  So, they couldn't get married.  Well, if you can't get married, you can't have sex.  So, that's why you have celibacy if you're being part of the church.  It's not in the New Testament or anything like that.  It really was all finances.  Exactly.  God, like shitheads.  So, why can't they change that?  If it has nothing to do with the Bible and all that? 
[00:52:30]  Ah, don't ask me.  No, I know.  I'm just throwing it out there.  Because now, with lawyers, they would absolutely lose money.  Back then, they would lose money.  They would absolutely lose it now.  And a lot of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Greek Orthodox priests could marry, as somebody mentioned, and it seems to help.  Yeah.  Well, this is what I would say to the Catholic religion.  It's obviously not working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, having the priests be celibate guys is not working.  There's a problem.  Now what?  You've got to figure something out. 
[00:53:00]  I think there's been a gradual shift.  You've noticed that they're sort of subtly allowing other people to work as priests.  They might not call them that, but to the same function.  So, there might be kind of a quiet shift.  I'm not an expert, but I sense that without an official change of party line.  And then I feel bad for the nuns.  I mean, I don't know what else they're supposed to do to get the big job.  Jesus. 
[00:53:30]  Right?  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  I've got to talk to that.  Someone explain why a woman cannot be a priest.  Because that's ridiculous, too.  Who wants one of them broads to be a priest?  Do you?  They're sadistic twats, most of them, anyway, the nuns.  A lot of the priests are closeted gay guys or frustrated sexual creatures, and the nuns  are all vicious bitches.  You know, most old women don't want to have sex, so that'll take care of part of the problem.  Yeah.  Thank you, Matt. 
[00:54:00]  You're welcome.  We've got a guy that teaches medieval history.  He wants to clear some things up.  Or is it a woman?  Ooh, Nicole.  What's up, Nicole?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  So, basically, what I wanted to call in and talk to you guys about was the clerical marriage.  So I teach medieval history, college level, and part of the issue is, in the Middle Ages,  around the year 1000, there was a bunch of reform movements going on, and one of them  was attacking priests, being married.  So bishops were not allowed to get married, but priests could. 
[00:54:30]  And so they basically wanted to get rid of that in order to keep them from passing their  positions on to their sons.  You know, that was a big part of it.  They did not want any sons inheriting these positions and keeping them in the family.  That's one of the things that I've always known about and taught.  I've never heard of the whole financial stuff before.  So he's the guy that called in about that or wrote in about that earlier.  I've never heard that before. 
[00:55:00]  So, but I wanted to address the mea maxima culpa video documentary on HBO as well.  I showed that to my students, and apparently people were very offended.  I showed, like, five minutes of that film.  They were offended?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And you teach college?  Yes, I teach college, and I apparently offended a bunch of my students over this.  And, you know, I feel really bad.  I wasn't, that wasn't the point.  You know, because obviously there's lots of abuses in the church in the medieval period. 
[00:55:30]  Can I ask you a question?  Excuse my interruption.  Why would you feel bad about that?  Like, as an instructor, as a teacher, doesn't that make you angry that they would be offended?  Like, isn't that angering?  Yes, yes, yes and no.  One, it wasn't my intention.  And, you know, going back to Catholic guilt, I'm not Catholic, but I felt kind of guilty about that.  You know, I didn't, it wasn't my intention at all.  I was just trying to make them aware of some of the situations that are happening in the present day. 
[00:56:00]  Because, you know, I teach history, and history is so relevant, despite probably what half of your listeners are probably saying right now,  is, oh, history is so boring, who cares?  But, yeah, I mean, I was just trying to kind of help them understand that a lot of this stuff is relevant.  So what did you do when they were offended?  I can't really do anything, because I don't have tenure.  But, I mean, did you continue playing, or did you stop it?  Or did you only intend on showing five minutes?  It was only, I only showed them, like, five minutes of the film to kind of help them understand why I think Cardinal Rassen, 
[00:56:30]  well, Pope Benedict, Cardinal Rassenburg, whatever, was possibly resigning.  And so we kind of talked a little bit about that, and, you know, then we moved on, and I gave lecture and stuff.  Can I ask you a question about the Rassenburg thing?  I know, I want to ask a question, too.  At any time, were you worried about your job when they started?  Now I'm kind of worried, yeah.  You're always afraid as a teacher, because you might teach the wrong fucking lesson that gets people pissed off.  Yeah, and I've always told my students, you know, before even the semester starts, 
[00:57:00]  if I ever say anything that upsets you, at least just let me know.  And unfortunately, they didn't.  They went, you know, higher up.  So I'm always afraid.  You shouldn't, I mean, it's easy for me to say, but that's what's wrong,  where college students are so vomit-inducing, is that they just run and say,  wait, the teacher said something we didn't like.  Like, because they are raised as now just a bunch of spoiled babies,  they're not up for any dialogue. 
[00:57:30]  Like, why wouldn't any of them have just raised their hand and said,  hey, look, I don't agree with that, and had a dialogue with them?  Right.  We really do come from a different world.  I would have never been offended by something a teacher said.  Not like that, no.  I'd be offended by the nonsense homework and all that crap, but.  Yeah, it's really frustrating.  I mean, I've been dealing with this.  I dealt with it in graduate school.  You know, I had, as a TA, I always had these issues where I might say something  that was unfavorable, and typically, you know, the professor would still, like, 
[00:58:00]  give me, you know, back me up a little bit, but it's hard.  It's hard to deal with, and I love my job.  I love teaching history.  I think it's fascinating, and, you know, it's unfortunate that this was something  I had to deal with, but I've learned my lessons, and I have to.  But you didn't do anything wrong.  Yeah, you shouldn't have to learn your lesson.  That's what sucks.  Yeah, I mean, it's just unfortunate, and I.  I guess you learned your lesson, meaning you want to keep your job.  Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of in the same boat you guys are, too.  You know, I may have, I may have a decent job, but I have to always be conscious now 
[00:58:30]  of the things I say and do.  Well, that's too bad.  So, Rhett, I'm sorry, when the Pope was the cardinal who kind of, at the Vatican,  all the pedophilia allegations were going through his office, did he want to pursue  them more, and John Paul kind of squashed it, or what exactly did he do there?  Well, I don't know nearly as much about present-day issues with, you know, some of the lawsuits  that are going on, but watching that documentary film on HBO really kind of made me aware. 
[00:59:00]  But the thing that frustrates me the most is once he became Pope, it doesn't seem like  anything got done about it, like he never pursued it, and like the one guy in the documentary,  Jimmy, you'll probably know what I'm talking about, but he said, that he, he said, I can't  believe a priest would do this, not, wow, we really need to help the victims, or, you  know, whatever.  And it's frustrating, because people think, I'm sure, I can just hear, you know, people  say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.  I'm sorry, but tens of thousands of children coming forward and adults coming forward saying 
[00:59:30]  they're abused, it's not a conspiracy theory.  Um, it, it happened, and they're covering it up, and it makes me really sad that they  don't care about the victims, and.  How long have you been a professor?  Um, I'm 27, so, um, I've been teaching on my own for a year now.  I just finished graduate school last year, um, so I taught a few institutions, like community  college level, small, small college level, and, you know, I'm, I'm starting to get really  frustrated, and I'm only 27 years old.  Right.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to get a PhD, I'm, I'm applying to graduate school again, so I 
[01:00:00]  can go further, and now I'm.  Record.  Frustrated.  Where do you live?  Are you, are you, are you an East Coast person or a West Coast person?  Yeah, I'm, well, I'm, I was, I was raised in the Midwest, but, uh, I live on the East  Coast now, and I hate it, I tell you that.  Well, I see, that's because you need the right boyfriend.  Oh.  I've been looking for a young lady friend who's got brains and who's got some, uh, who's  possibly going to have tenure.  I need somebody in my life who's going to have tenure.  Tenure.  Hold on, someone, someone's calling you nuts, hold on. 
[01:00:30]  Dave in Cleveland, I'm going to put you on with Nicole and Marilyn.  Go ahead, Dave.  Yeah, Nicole is, uh, is totally off base on this.  The celibacy situation did not start in the, the medieval times.  It started, actually, after the Council of Nicaea.  But it was first recommended by St. Paul in his letters to the Romans that, that celibacy  I thought the Corinthians.  What'd I write?  I couldn't hear what he said.  He said something about, it was, it was recommended by St. Paul in his letter to, uh, the Romans. 
[01:01:00]  The letter to the Corinthians, where he was just doing a bunch of limericks and jokes.  But the letter to the Romans was apparently about this, sir.  Yeah.  Well, well, as far as the Bible goes, um, you know, I don't know specifically all the  verses in the Bible that refer to it.  What I'm mainly talking about is the reforms that happened in the Catholic Church, because  priests were allowed to be married.  And then eventually...  No, they were not.  They were not allowed.  Whoa, never?  No, they were not. 
[01:01:30]  They were allowed from after the, uh, well, if they were, they were doing it on their own,  but they were not allowed to.  They were not, they were, they took the vow of celibacy became active around, around, uh,  around 400.  400.  And, and what, what are you saying that it became relevant?  He's saying 400.  And where's Dave's info coming from?  Dave, what do you do that you know all this stuff?  Well, I'm, uh, very active in my, my diocese.  I have a history going back, you know, I study. 
[01:02:00]  Diocese.  Yes.  Yes.  Diocese.  So you guys have a disagreement by how many years?  How many years do you think the other one is off?  Well, the thing is, I mean, uh, Opie said that, you know, it's not working.  Obviously this isn't working.  The church has been around for 2000 years.  Yeah.  It's working because it's surviving.  Yeah.  It's not working right now.  It's working.  It's working.  You had, I like the crusades.  Hold on, sir.  I mean, I don't know as much as you certainly, but it's not working. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, the numbers are way down.  People aren't going to church like they used to.  Do you think just in our fucking lifetimes, there's a massive drop off on the amount of people  going to Catholic church?  Dave, do you think this is working?  You're wrong about that.  You're wrong.  Look at the statistics.  There's been more people joining the Catholic church, uh, you know, than ever.  Historically, in the United States, you have more growth going on in the Catholic church.  Yeah.  I have heard nothing about that. 
[01:03:00]  I would love to, I would love to see the numbers, Dave.  Where can I go to see this?  Well, I'll be happy to email it to you.  But look, even if you're right, he might be right.  You're not getting my email address.  Busy.  No, no, no, no.  But you really think this is working?  Like, look at the, it's an embarrassment.  Like, people really do see priests and get creeped out.  Like, and that's, that's...  No, it's because of the media.  No, it's not.  Oh, my God.  There's so many, there's so many, there's so many good, there's so many good people.  Yes.  And the church does so much good work. 
[01:03:30]  I agree with all that.  I said that, yes.  Yeah, we did say that.  The hospitals, uh, the way we have hospitals today, the way we have universities.  But you, I know.  The way we have charities.  But why, we said that.  We did say all that.  We said that, and I agree with you.  But the way they, a lot of, there's a lot of good deeds that get overshadowed by a systematic  covering up of child fucking, systematically covering up child fucking overshadows a lot  of good deeds.  The fact is, it really wasn't child fucking. 
[01:04:00]  It wasn't little kids.  Oh, my God.  Wow, you're not saying this.  I'm not, no, I'm not defending it at all.  I'm an apologist.  People have to defend their religion.  What are you, what are you talking about, dude?  It wasn't little kids.  What do you mean?  Yeah, you gotta explain that, Dave.  It was mostly all, like, you know, 16, 17-year-olds that were the ones making the  complaints.  Well, I'm out of this one, then.  But, I mean, but I'm not, again.  And I guess that's okay when these guys certainly did not want to have sex with the priest, but  it's okay because they were a little older? 
[01:04:30]  No, I'm not, not defending it at all.  It was, they were, they were horrible.  The thing is, what happened at that time, in the 70s, that's what the psychologists were  recommending.  I mean, that's just a fact.  What?  They were doing, they were wowing what the most acceptable psychological recommendation  Okay.  Which was, which as we see in hindsight, was wrong.  Yeah, well, so they didn't know that, dude, you're saying that the media is, it's not  a media thing.  I know people that have been molested by priests. 
[01:05:00]  I was shocked to hear it when somebody told me that they were abused by a priest.  It's not the media creating this.  Believe me, the media is terrible.  No, the media wants to jump on it because they hate the church because of its position on  abortion.  Do you, why don't you just do, why don't you just accept the fact that all of these  victims coming out are not just shills of the media.  The media can be pigs and they can be liars.  Why don't you just understand that the church has to take the hit on this one and they could  have, they could have for years stopped this. 
[01:05:30]  I have no problem with that.  You obviously have a problem with it.  No, I don't.  It's a horrible thing.  You just said it was the media.  Well, the media is playing it out of proportion.  They're different.  Like you said, every priest is, is, is seem creepy.  Because so many of them have done anything of this nature.  First of all, you don't know that, but you might, you're probably right.  The majority of them probably haven't.  Yeah.  And, and, and hold on.  I said that.  I didn't, I wasn't saying as, as, as a fact. 
[01:06:00]  I was just saying that's my, you know, feeling when I see a priest.  Factoid.  Right.  I'm, I'm sure there's a lot of priests doing a lot of good out there.  There's, there's 99% of them are.  No, no.  I wouldn't say 99%.  I would say a very high percentage.  It may be, but 99%, I don't believe it's that.  And the way the church has protected these guys, aren't you embarrassed to be involved  with an organization that takes known pedophiles and then moves them from fucking diocese to 
[01:06:30]  diocese or parish to parish, that's, and won't turn them over to the police?  All of them, in hindsight, yeah, but like I said.  Wait, hold on, let me, no, no, wait, dude, why, what do you mean in hindsight?  In what time, in what, in what moment of present did the organization not know that child fucking  is wrong and we shouldn't send this guy from, say, Rhode Island to Cleveland?  When did, when did all of a sudden that knowledge come on to these people, so to speak?  Like I said, all of them were, were given, any of them that they knew of, were, were, 
[01:07:00]  were given psychological, uh, training.  All right, all right, psychological training.  Yeah, that again.  Hold on, hold on.  I got to say goodbye to Nicole.  Bye, Nicole.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, guys.  Have a great day.  All right.  Who started this whole damn thing.  Thank you, Nicole.  We got to go to John, who's on with Dave in Cleveland.  He has a question for Dave.  John, go ahead.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Amen.  All right.  So I grew up, I don't even care, I'll burn it up.  I grew up in Ridgefield, Connecticut. 
[01:07:30]  We had one major Roman Catholic church there.  It was St. Mary's, way down by Main Street.  Growing up there, my parents took me out of like CCD at 12.  I never knew why.  Never had any questions about it.  I stopped going to church, play around 13 or 14.  Years later, it comes out that our priest who drove a nice, you know, Land Rover, Range Rover, whatever the hell he had.  He was also fucking 13-year-old kids.  Not girls.  13-year-old boys.  He used to fuck 13-year-old boys.  Hands down. 
[01:08:00]  He got arrested.  He went to prison for it.  It's a news story.  You can look it up.  I want this guy in Cleveland to please fucking explain to me, in any way, shape, or form, how you can even justify and defend someone who fucks a 13-year-old and his asshole.  I never justified anything.  I said they're all scumbags.  I said they're scumbags.  No, you're saying that there's some kind of psychological disputation based on the fact that in the 70s, psychologists were telling kids to tell people they were raped.  Are you fucking retarded? 
[01:08:30]  No, I never defended it already, dude.  Are you a fucking religion?  You're going out the fucking door.  It promotes child fucking stupid.  You're such an idiot.  You're not even listening to what I'm saying.  I grew up around this shit.  You're not defending any of that crap.  Never defended any of it.  Never defended any of it.  You are defending it.  You sound like a fucking apologist defender, dude.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And there's so many that have been caught.  No, no, a little bit.  How many have not been caught? 
[01:09:00]  You're such an idiot.  I've never even.  You've given your money.  I've never defended it.  You've been really involved in your diocese.  You've got to be a pedophile.  Go fuck yourself.  I got to be.  Shut up, you fuckhead.  You know what, dude?  Shut up, you fuckhead.  I'm trying to.  No, but dude, you're explaining it away.  Like it was this thing of the past and in hindsight.  No, I wasn't.  You just did.  Every argument just breaks down.  It just really does break down into. 
[01:09:30]  Faggot, fuckface.  Dave, let me ask you.  You just did, dude.  Were you ever touched by a priest?  No, never.  All right, no disrespect, but I'm just asking.  Well, if somebody did, I would have punched them in the face.  Oh, stop it.  Let somebody do that.  The majority of the, you just said that the media made this problem.  You're not realizing the fact that as an organization, they systematically covered it up.  Why are you not for real addressing that?  The way you're addressing that is by going, well, they were older kids, 16, 17, or, oh, well, in hindsight. 
[01:10:00]  I'm not defending it.  I'm not defending it.  You're softening it.  Yeah, you are softening it a little bit.  You're softening it.  All right, softening, whatever.  But all I call it.  No, not whatever.  No, it can't be a whatever.  This is what I called about.  I wasn't calling about defending any of that kind of stuff.  I was calling to explain why there was celibacy in the church.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you gave your...  The idea was that, like Christ said, you can't serve two masters.  Did he really?  How can you possibly be able to... 
[01:10:30]  Oh, just more horseshit.  Oh, just more horseshit.  It really is.  The way the fucking Bible came about and how they selectively chose the stories to go in.  And this is all...  Doesn't it bother you that there's not a lot about Christ's teenage years in there?  Doesn't that bug you at all?  It's a show called The O.C. that was on.  The Bible is not a historical document.  But it is.  It's a spiritual document.  No, but...  It's to give us...  Doesn't that bother you?  Christ's ministry started when he was 30. 
[01:11:00]  It was a three-year ministry where he taught the world how to live.  And he put everything...  Doesn't that bother you?  Three years?  I want to read all the stuff they decided wasn't good enough for the Bible.  Yeah, all the stuff that was not the popular teachings of the time.  Yeah, I would love to read some of that stuff.  Mike in Chicago has something for Dave in Cleveland.  Go ahead, Mike.  Mike!  Hey, Mike.  Mikey!  Nothing?  It's not.  All right.  It was similar to the last caller.  I mean, every city's calling in now. 
[01:11:30]  They all know of a priest.  Yeah.  It's been in newspapers about these scumbags.  But the vast majority of these men are great people who do some wonderful work.  Yeah, it's the media, right?  It's the media.  The media.  This was the media.  And we said that.  We disagree with your number that it's 99%.  What do you think the number is?  That's a good question.  I would say 75% to 80% are really good people, and the other 20%... 
[01:12:00]  Wow, that high, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  I would give them that many.  I would say 75% to 80% are good people.  But you know, who's the number one offender of children, abuser of children?  Michael Jackson?  Yeah.  As an organization, I would say...  As a population, what's the number one abuser?  I don't know, to be honest.  Parents.  That's not a terrible answer.  That's not an organization. 
[01:12:30]  What's the second most?  The Catholic Church.  No.  No.  Teachers.  Really?  They have systematically...  Hold on.  They have systematically, for centuries, covered up sexual abuse of children.  Come on, man.  Stop it.  You're not being honest.  No.  I'm saying that.  I'm not defending it.  And teachers...  It's horrible.  And they're scumbags for doing it.  And by the way, teachers...  You might not be wrong, by the way.  I would believe teachers have abused more kids.  Yeah, but it's not like a teacher finds out and then covers it up for another teacher. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then there's a whole school that sends the other teachers somewhere...  To another town to teach.  Yeah, it's...  Right.  It's a little more complicated than that, but I don't necessarily disagree with you on  that one.  They don't have the solidarity Catholics have.  They're not all members of this...  Under the exact same umbrella that Catholicism is.  Come on, man.  Well, but those numbers are correct, though.  They're absolutely correct.  Well, then your church...  You know what, buddy?  Your church should have done a better job on taking care of children instead of protecting 
[01:13:30]  their own financial interests.  Those numbers are correct right there.  Oh, yeah.  You guys should have done a better job.  And then your fucking archdiocese in Boston wouldn't have taken billion dollar hits.  And then you wouldn't be seen by people all over the world.  Oh, you guys should have done a better job.  And Dave...  Yep, but it's such a small amount of people...  A lot more than you think.  Yeah, that's where we're going to have to disagree.  Yeah, small amount of number of bad press, right? 
[01:14:00]  Tell yourself that.  And Dave, I'm going to now have to unfollow you on Twitter.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  I'm sorry, but it has to be done now.  Who's lead are you taking there, Opie?  I don't know.  I just think it's the right thing to do.  Oh, gee.  Someone just sent me the name of the Pope's supposed boyfriend.  Really?  The same guy that's kind of...  Sal?  Same guy that kind of has all that inside info that he's been kind of feeding me.  Really?  Yeah.  And there's some questionable pictures with...  Look at this one.  Ooh, that looks nice. 
[01:14:30]  They're having a moment.  There's a guy that's around the Pope a lot, and some are saying it's his boyfriend.  And there's a few pictures online where he's certainly helping the Pope.  Look at this one.  Look at this one.  That's a good one right there.  Very fucking nice of him.  He's helping the Pope.  I guess it's just windy that day, and he's got to make sure the Pope's outfit is hanging 
[01:15:00]  properly.  Did you watch that Mia Culpa video?  I haven't seen that one yet.  Did you, buddy?  On Dave?  I'm sorry.  No, I haven't seen it.  Why don't you watch it?  Just an open mind.  Just watch it.  Trust me.  I've watched every other special about these things.  I'm very, very sympathetic for the kids who...  You're sympathetic.  It didn't sound that long.  No.  You're interested in learning what you can to protect the church.  You're downplaying going, ah, most of them are 16-year-olds.  They wanted it.  They wanted it, right? 
[01:15:30]  They were asking for it.  No one's attacking you.  Never.  Nobody deserves any of that.  All right.  And that was calling about...  I was calling about...  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now we got Lydia on the line.  We haven't heard from her in a long time.  Remember her?  She's in rehab.  She knows a thing or two about psych stuff.  Lydia, you're on with Dave in Cleveland.  Good morning, guys.  Hello.  I haven't called in quite some time.  We know.  I just became quite incensed.  Oh.  I am a clinical psychologist. 
[01:16:00]  I do not know of any psychological treatments in the 1970s that advocated priests having sex with children.  I'm really not sure what this is talking about.  Nobody ever said that.  They gave them treatment and said that they were able to fix them of these problems and then move them on to other locations.  They said that they were treatable. 
[01:16:30]  That was the accepted psychological prognosis of the time.  And it ends up being wrong.  It was wrong.  And it was wrong.  It was wrong, Ripley.  Right.  I hear you.  He's saying that the crazy priests that are fucking the kids were, that they could be cured.  Not that they prescribed having sex with priests for the kids.  Right, right.  Gotcha.  I got you. 
[01:17:00]  Dave, we're going to let you go.  Thank you for your phone call today.  I mean, hey, again, I mean, I was not going to defend any of that kind of nonsense.  All right.  All I was trying to do was...  Inadvertently did.  Yes.  Congratulations.  You accidentally made it look like pedophilia is a number one.  We never would do that, dude.  Come on.  I know.  It was a joke.  You fucking humorless booze.  We are trying to throw some...  All I wanted to do was...  Shut up.  All right, Wits.  You made your point.  Thank you, sir.  Exactly.  And we're just trying to throw a few jokes into the situation.  You wanted to call in and say that pedophilia is okay if somebody's in a position of trust. 
[01:17:30]  I understand.  So long, Dave.  So long, Lydia.  Dave made a good point.  Dave, according to Dave, that in the 70s, the Pope decreed that they should psychologically  teach these kids to shut their mouths because the priests needed a good place to unload  and their bottoms were out.  Dave, thank you for convincing us of that.  And Rob's got a very good question in Jersey.  He really does.  Rob, go ahead.  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Just a question for Opie. 
[01:18:00]  I've heard you say before on the air about how you don't like organized religion.  And you mentioned before that you take the kids, I guess, you know, the whole family  to church.  Right.  I was just kind of curious on why, you know, what's up with that.  Sure.  I don't think it's up to me to decide my kids' religion.  I want them to be open-minded and learn and then let them make the decision.  Well, if that's the case, you'd have to take them to every different religion.  Well, sure, sure. 
[01:18:30]  And that's where it gets complicated, you know.  But I'll at least start with the religion I was brought up with.  And plus, you know, there's other people around me that influence my kids as well.  I'm not the only voice.  I do not believe in organized religion at this time in my life.  Yes, that's absolutely true.  But I have a sister, fuck it, I have an older sister that has decided to not, she didn't  raise her kids religious whatsoever and decided, you know, someday if they're into it, they 
[01:19:00]  could figure it all out themselves.  And I think that puts a kid in a rough spot.  See, that's exactly what I'm doing.  Me and my wife, I was brought up Jewish and she was Protestant.  Right.  And when we got together, we both just decided, you know, we both agreed, we don't believe  in God, we're not, we just don't, and that's how we're raising our kids.  But we tell them, look, if you do believe and if you feel like that's something you want  to do, then go ahead, absolutely, go check it out.  Yeah, well, my nephew and niece, they're now in their 20s and they don't even have a concept  of religion and they're absolutely not going to study it on their own. 
[01:19:30]  I figure as a parent, I'll at least push him down a path and then let him figure the  shit out and let my daughter figure the shit out.  Whether it's right or wrong, I don't know.  Maybe I should just be like, look, this is nonsense.  I do, but I don't want to be that guy that goes, oh, I know better because I don't in  the end.  I don't.  I don't, I have no idea if there's a God or not.  So I'm not going to say, well, because I'm a little confused right now that you should  not believe in this shit.  Well, let me ask you something.  Let's say they take to it and they really enjoy going to church. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  And then they turn around and they say, Dad, well, you know, what do you think about this?  You know, do you think there is a God or how come?  I mean, they're obviously going to sense that you're not totally into it.  Take a drag up the cigarette, say Jesus Christ and smack them.  Right.  I hope we have an open discussion about it.  Sure.  And maybe, maybe my kids will end up teaching me a thing or two about it.  I don't know.  Right.  I don't know.  I think it's, I think it's completely ridiculous.  You're born into a religion too, but I don't know how else, I don't know how else you could  do it, but you know, a lot of these religions like you to think it's the only way. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  So if you're not born into that religion, you're fucked from the day you're born.  But I think the fact that you guys have a menorah in your house that the kids have to  boo when they walk out, it's just very biased.  It's good to show them a framework of a religion.  That's exactly what I'm trying to say.  And you got to pick one.  So you pick the one that's closest to you that you know best.  Right.  But then after a while they might say like, oh, okay, I know that there's this thing, religion  out there.  I know what the basic gist is. 
[01:21:00]  And if I want to choose, you know, Baptist or fucking Protestant or something later on,  they already have that little launching pad.  Right now I'm into meditation and there's a lot of spirituality in that.  Oh.  You know, but I don't know if that's the way to go either.  I have no idea.  I've been into a, I've been to a Baptist church a bunch of times.  They have a lot of fucking fun.  I've been to a temple.  That's just fucking misery.  Yeah, that sucks.  I know.  I don't know that.  I mean, you're right.  You probably should try out a whole bunch of religions, but you know, I mean, that ain't 
[01:21:30]  happening.  Yeah, it's tough, man.  It's a tough call.  I think the whole thing is ridiculous though.  You're born a Catholic and let's say if, if, if there is a God, he's like, no, that's  not, that's not the one.  But then you go, look, I gave it my all though.  You got to give me credit for that.  Right.  You know, you know, and then you got the newer religion.  They think that's the way to go.  Everybody's got their own God.  It's kind of, it's kind of weird.  But my point is, and Ann made it much better for me and I appreciate it.  I'm just giving the kid a framework and then it's really, don't let him figure it all out. 
[01:22:00]  And if he has questions, I'll, I'll tell him what I think and know.  And, and, and, and he'll certainly ask his grandparents and everybody else around him.  Right, right, right.  Texas village.  My in-laws are much more religious than me and I, you know, I don't really, I don't really  mind it.  You know, they bring my kids to church a lot more than I do.  So, I don't think it, I don't think it hurts them.  Yeah, my kids, like I said, we're bringing them up with, with no religion and it's tough  for them at school.  A lot of, a lot of the kids in school, you know, they can't even mention the fact that 
[01:22:30]  they don't believe in God.  Right.  They're looking, they're looking at like, oh my God, you know, oh my God.  They're looking at like, wow, you know, that's how you possibly, how can you live like  that?  Right.  So, so your kids aren't religious at all?  No, not, not in the least bit, no.  I don't, good luck with the little devils.  And they're great kids, man.  They're like, you know, they're really, really good kids.  Yeah, I don't, I don't.  Even though they're condemned.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  And I don't see anything wrong with that if that's what you decided, by the way.  You know, it's really up to the individual.  This guy is piggybacking your call. 
[01:23:00]  Thanks, Rob.  Let me go to Noel in Massachusetts real fast.  Noel.  You rock back.  Toby.  Yeah.  I think, do you want your kid scared to death for the rest of his life?  You know, that's what's going to happen with this religion thing, right?  Uh, no, I don't think so, because I'm not.  I was brought up pretty fucking Catholic.  I was brought up, I went to religion class on Tuesday nights in some miserable household  where they were uber religious.  I did it all. 
[01:23:30]  I went to, I went to retreats and everything.  So you're trying to tell me that you never have a fear of death.  It never creeps into your mind and that you're going to die.  I'm scared of death like anyone else, but I'm not, not scared, uh, from a religious, uh,  standpoint anymore.  No.  So do you recognize evolution as a fact?  Of course I do, and I will teach that.  So why don't you go down that road with your kids?  Dude, it's, you're right.  The whole thing is completely ridiculous.  That's what I'm trying to say.  He's got all the answers, though.  My kid will not, my kid will not believe that the earth is only, what, 80 years old or whatever the fuck? 
[01:24:00]  80 years.  You know what, Opie?  You know what, Opie?  I don't think your child is just going to figure that out on his own.  I think you're going to teach him that at some point.  I'm going to.  You're going to realize that religion is bullshit.  You're going to notice that your kid is kind of going down a path that you recognize as a bunch of nutty people.  And you'll, you'll, you'll, I think you'll do the right thing.  I think you'll do the right thing.  I'm just going to try to give them, I think the best thing you can do as a parent, and I'm obviously ridiculously new to this whole thing, is just give them as much knowledge as possible. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, but right now you're letting them.  We're not going to go to a museum and try to, like, reason that, you know, the dinosaurs are only a couple of fucking, what, hundred years old?  Yeah, 1930s.  1930s, the last one died off during Teddy Roosevelt's time, I think.  Of course not.  I'm going to give them as much fucking knowledge as possible.  That's all I can do.  It's a very tough thing to shake off for some, Opie.  Some can never, ever break the chains of religion.  Did you, were you raised religious, sir? 
[01:25:00]  Yes, I was.  And then look at you.  So why would you think that you could shake it, but no one else can?  No, no, no, I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that, Jimmy.  You can.  But I didn't have a parent teaching me evolution because they didn't, they didn't believe it.  They didn't understand it.  They didn't have, I don't know why.  They just didn't believe in it.  Well, it's a lie.  That's why they didn't believe in it.  Yeah, well.  Evolution's bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I will absolutely teach my kid, uh, kids, uh, evolution.  That's what I hope you do, man. 
[01:25:30]  Because it's, I'm not saying there's an easy answer.  It's very confusing.  Because they, they counter, they counterdict each other.  I don't understand by knowing the truth.  We know the truth.  I don't know the truth.  Not, there's not a human being alive that actually knows the truth.  Do you understand that, sir?  You can't handle the truth.  That's what I've heard.  I can see where organized religion is bullshit and all that, but I, there's not a human being  that knows the goddamn truth.  You know, some of the brightest people, sir, sir, sir, some of the brightest people, like  some of the greatest physicists believe in God. 
[01:26:00]  It's, it's not some crazy thing that all brilliant scientists don't believe.  Right.  I think like Stephen Hawking, and I, I could just be mentioning his name, but there's quite  a few of them in, in that world that do believe it.  Huh?  No, you mean Stephen Hawking?  He actually doesn't believe in God.  But there are plenty, oh yeah, that's right, he did come out and say he didn't, but there  are plenty in that, in that world that do.  It's not like none of them believe as much as they know about science.  Oh, yeah, they're, but they're God to be, he said there's no God.  What they believe as God could be completely different than what we know. 
[01:26:30]  And that's fine, and that's fair, but we know organized religion is bullshit.  So to believe that there might be a God is one thing.  To let someone feed this is God to your child is irresponsible.  Stand up like, like a fucking man, step up to your wife and tell her no.  That's not my wife, you stupid fuck.  You don't know the first fucking thing about me, you dope.  It's not my fucking wife, you idiot. 
[01:27:00]  Holy fuck, these people that think they know your lives.  Shut the fuck up.  You said it with family members, right?  My in-laws, I said, are more religious than me.  And more religious than my wife.  And they bring them to church from time to time.  And I don't think, at this point, it's a bad thing.  Okay?  So don't think you fucking know me, you idiot. 
[01:27:30]  Hope, you can turn it to something really bad.  You know it.  What am I, could someone explain this idiot to me, please?  I'm lost with this guy.  I said it.  I'm just giving him knowledge.  And then I'll give him as much knowledge as possible.  And her, my daughter.  And then they'll figure some shit out on their own.  I figured shit out on my own, eventually. 
[01:28:00]  If my kids don't want to go to church and don't want to believe in God, so be it.  That'll be their thing.  I'm not pushing religion on them.  I'm just fucking giving them, this is one thing that people do and believe in.  And then let's see where it goes.  The parent's job is to give their kid the life starter kit.  You give them a little bit of this, that, and then they figure it out and fucking roll with it.  The parent's job is to discipline a child.  To punish.  Spare the rod. 
[01:28:30]  Well, you can go to bed unsatisfied.  And no one knows.  No one knows for sure.  No.  No one knows for sure.  We know.  You know what?  What do you know?  It don't look good for God, people.  That's the unfortunate.  I wish they could.  You know, Penn asked me.  He quoted Christopher Hitchens on something.  And he said that Hitchens, people always say, well, I wish that I could believe in a God again.  And Penn said that Hitchens had written something that he agreed with, which was, why would you want to believe in a God when it's all of this and that and punishing and blah, blah, blah. 
[01:29:00]  But my answer, when Penn asked me that, was simply because I want to exist.  I want to continue to exist.  That's why I want to believe that there's something.  Because so far in life, that's what it's told me is how you continue to exist.  You go to heaven.  Now, I don't necessarily believe in heaven.  But I do think there's something after.  And it may be totally scientifically explainable.  But I like the idea of existing. 
[01:29:30]  And it's hard to fathom not existing.  So we build these ways that we can exist.  And there may be a scientific way that we do exist.  But I don't like the idea of my consciousness just being turned off like a light switch.  Well, of course.  So that's why people say, oh, I want to believe in a God.  That's why I want to.  I absolutely lean toward, you know, you shut down like a fucking computer.  I do lean toward that.  I hope not.  I hope not either.  But no one knows for sure.  And it certainly is not going to be.  It could be some far-fetched thing that we haven't even, we can't even, we don't even have a concept of yet. 
[01:30:00]  Well, that's just it.  But it's certainly not going to be something that some fucking guys who didn't know anything about science were going to figure out and put in a book years ago.  Right.  Completely based on a spiritual thing.  You know, it could be something very scientific and very tactile, not so abstract.  Right.  That actually is that we can't understand.  But if that's the case, it's not going to be written in some book from fucking a couple thousand years ago. 
[01:30:30]  I don't believe in a heaven with pearly gates and all that crap.  No, of course not.  You don't need gates.  Keep out.  No one's trying to run out.  Undesirables.  I don't know what it is.  I'm hoping.  Sure, like anyone else, I'm hoping there's something, but I don't know.  I don't know.  And yeah, I'm not a fan of organized religion, but that's not.  But you can't do that to your own kids.  Let them fucking figure it out.  I like organized crime.  I love organized crime.  That's cool.  Do you believe in organized religion? 
[01:31:00]  Were you brought up religious, Jimmy?  Of course.  Confirmation, communion.  I just found communion.  I know I've had them for a while.  Communion pictures.  When I went to church in Edison.  And yeah, I was very raised religiously.  And to my knowledge, never abused in the church.  And had decent experiences.  But I just kind of grew to dislike the organization.  And I lost all respect for the organization the more I've learned about it.  And I listened to that guy Dave who called up.  And he's a sincere guy.  Do you still have spirituality in your life, though? 
[01:31:30]  I need more.  Obviously, I wouldn't be jerking off for one in the morning if I was really spiritual.  But spirituality is like an action thing.  It's helping people.  Right.  It's a different thing than just...  I mean, kneeling and praying is...  A lot of people would call it meditation.  There is something very, very therapeutic about it.  There's more to it than a lot of atheists will give it.  It's not just nonsense.  There's something to it.  I don't know exactly what.  I'm really into meditation right now.  Yeah, meditation is supposed to be great for you.  Obviously, as I yell and scream at a fucking caller.  But that's what I'm into right now. 
[01:32:00]  But that does...  You know.  I'm not preaching that to anybody else.  It's working for me.  Mm-hmm.  So it's some type of spirituality.  Yeah.  And they try not to say it's a religion.  No, it's not.  A lot of religions are based on just meditating and mantras and all that shit.  I think we needed religion, though.  I don't think it's just because we're dumb.  I think that people needed something above us.  That's my theory, because we don't have any natural enemies.  So there's no checks and balances with us.  So what is it that gives us morality? 
[01:32:30]  Like, why do people...  What prevents us from just piping each over the head and raping?  It's this fear that something will happen after.  Right.  How'd you point your arm, Ant?  Oh, I guess they...  Oh, that was a good visual.  But it's the fear.  It's the thing that would keep everybody in line.  And I think that nature puts that little gene in us.  I don't think that's just a bunch of powerful, greedy people that came up with that. 
[01:33:00]  It's what keeps us in line.  Because the idea of, hey, it's just not nice to do that is not a big enough selling point.  Yeah, there is something inside your person that lets you know it's wrong.  It's not like, you know, if you killed somebody, you get a bad feeling.  And some people actually, that's good for them.  It's a good feeling for them.  And they are psychopaths.  But the majority of people know that that's something you're not supposed to do. 
[01:33:30]  And it's not just because it's against the religious law or, you know, the real law.  But I don't know about that.  If instincts were only, if it was only instinct and you weren't taught any morality, we would fucking, all we would do is fucking bash women and rape them.  No, we have an innate compassion and empathy.  That is something that's in us. 
[01:34:00]  And it's almost a chicken versus the egg thing.  The religion, I think, came from that part of us.  We didn't have the religion give us that sense of morality and stuff.  We took our sense of morality and then had to make up some kind of reason that we have it.  Okay, maybe.  But I think that sense of morality and the religious thing, I think nature gives you that.  Again, it's a checks and balances.  You're right.  Maybe we did create it to explain this thing. 
[01:34:30]  But we have to have a reason to go, why shouldn't I do this?  Like, you know, certain animals don't do this because they will fucking starve to death if they do this.  Right, right.  Fucking chickens don't run around and go, hey, wolf, eat my ass.  Because their instincts tell them that they'll be devoured and wiped off the planet if they do that.  But we have no natural enemies like that because we're more powerful than our elements.  We're more powerful than any other animal.  So what's the one stopping thing which tells us don't do this? 
[01:35:00]  Ah, it's the big animal or the big starvation, which is God.  That's the one thing that can fucking shut us down.  And that's what fucking – maybe that's what we made it into.  But I think that little piece of needing it was we were born with.  Right.  All right.  Oh, I don't know.  Well, we're not going to figure it out here.  I want to be figured out by 9.30.  You want this?  I want all the answers.  I want this wrapped up in humanity by 9.30.  I want everybody to agree.  The thing that frustrated me about that one caller, because now that I've had time to just kind of digest it, 
[01:35:30]  is the fact that he thinks he knows and it should be his way.  That's ridiculous.  No one knows for sure.  No, no.  No one knows.  Everyone thinks they really have it all figured out.  No one does.  It's not a human alive that has it figured out.  They have their ideas.  Yeah.  Well, it's like Ant was saying before the show.  I mean, if the Jews continue to behave this way, we're all going to be in trouble.  Ant, that was a great point.  We'll be right back. 
[01:36:00]  I love the Jews.  Keep nice manicured lawns around my neighborhood.  Jews are great neighbors.  Yes.  Gays are great neighbors, too.  Yes.  Excellent neighbors.  Gay Jews.  Wow.  So, it's very complicated.  You know, I guess it would be very easy to bring up your kids the same way with all your beliefs,  but I don't believe in that.  That's an old school way to raising kids.  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much, you know.  I don't know.  My dad was very open-minded.  He allowed us to do a lot of our own thinking. 
[01:36:30]  He didn't say this is the way it has to be.  So, I thank my father for that.  I don't want to bring up my kid the way I was brought up.  No.  That would mean I would be yelling and screaming all the time.  Yeah.  In my household.  So, you just give them knowledge.  Yeah.  And like you said, you have to at least give your kid framework.  I think you have to at least do that.  Then they get old enough to figure it out.  Yeah.  Start asking questions.  Yeah, ask a lot of questions.  And you know what? 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to say I don't know a lot.  You don't want your kid running up a tree when he starts learning about things in school.  Yeah, man.  I grew up in a household that we just never talked about sex or none of that shit.  So, when my dad finally brought it up, I was 12 or 13.  It was creepy.  So, yeah, I did run up into an apple tree.  Get up in that tree.  And it was embarrassing when he said, just come down.  It's not going to be that bad.  Come down.  Yeah, if it's not going to be that bad, then why didn't we talk about this shit, you know, before now? 
[01:37:30]  Was he getting graphic about what happens?  Was he using dirty words?  Like, I've got to explain to you what the cock does.  You know, you've seen chitch cunts before, haven't you?  He used the worst language possible.  He was extremely uncomfortable.  And I remember when he was talking about, like, female body parts and stuff.  It just sounded so stupid.  And the only reason he did it was because he got the phone call from Washington Drive.  Today we're going to show the film.  So, we're encouraging all parents to try to have an open discussion today. 
[01:38:00]  Great.  Pour it on him in one day because tomorrow the jig's up at school.  He came from the Frank Sinatra, you know, generation.  He just missed the Beatles.  And that was a big difference if you think about it.  I bet you your dad was a Beatles guy.  Not a Beatles guy, but came from that, you know, that genre.  Well, he kind of was more of a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Well, that's rock and roll, though.  Leather jacket and fucking...  Yeah, that's rock and roll, though.  That's...  My dad, you know...  I guess he learned to understand rock and roll a little bit.  But he was Frank Sinatra, Sinatra, Perry Como, all those guys. 
[01:38:30]  Those guys absolutely thought differently.  Well, all he cared about is that I didn't grow up a queer.  A quay.  Would he be disappointed?  Son of a bitch  All right  Kevin Hart's coming in today?  Yeah  What's he promoting?  He's hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend  Holy fuck, seriously?  Yeah  It's this weekend already?

[01:42:00]  Call 1-800-VAG-POOP  Calling in to your favorite radio show  Can be one of the funniest experiences there is  Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo  Joe Piscopo  It's been so many years, sir  You can get your point across  And have a laugh with the boys  How long did we know each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago  It was a long time  But sometimes  Things can go horribly  Horribly raw  Without the proper forethought 
[01:42:30]  These dream calls become the stuff of nightmares  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, hey, what's the...  I'm trying to keep it nice  Yeah, of course  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises  And extreme humiliation on a national level  And I wanted to plug, too, in Scottsdale  Tomorrow night I'm at the Talking Stick Resort  Which is going to be a plan  Only the good places for you, Joe  Joe Piscopo  And that includes Jersey 
[01:43:00]  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here  And everybody's got that work ethic  Because after the Sandy situation  We all joined together  It's too bad you didn't have a beach holiday  A room full of silence  Can only lead to irrecoverable damage  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box  So before you pick up that phone  Remember  The next asshole could be you 
[01:43:30]  Hello, guys  Hello, dear  Come on now  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony show  What happened?  What happened?  Hello, hello  Ahoy, mateys  Time to launch back onto the seven seas  With your favorite aqua adventurer  Captain Louie  It was my first day in the boat  I just bought it  But it's this big fucking boat with two engines 
[01:44:00]  And it's really complicated to drive  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it  We went out to the Statue of Liberty  And there was this thing floating in the water  Chris saw it  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing  And it was dark  It was night  It was like one in the morning  So it looked like  You know, like a big round raft?  That's what it looked like to me  And I yelled over  Hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us  Like kind of with some speed  And Chris goes  Get the fuck away from that thing  Like it was creepy  So I backed away from it  And I put a light on it 
[01:44:30]  And it was  It was like  It looked like a giant manhole cover  Sticking out of the river  This was the weirdest night fucking ever  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty  And it's like  I don't know  20 feet across  And it's moving  It's leaving a wake  So I call up  And then this woman came on  And says  New York Harbor Coast Guard  Give me your phone number  So I give her my number  And this guy calls  He goes  Describe it as well as you can  I go  I don't want to cause a problem  But it looks like the hatch of a submarine  And it's headed towards lower Manhattan  That's what I'm seeing  And I'm sure it's not that 
[01:45:00]  But my main concern is  It's not lit  And it could cream  Anything that hits  It's going down  And the guy goes  Alright, well  I'll call the boat  And send them to you  So he hangs up  And like 20 minutes later  There's nobody there  So anyway  I call back  And they're not sending anybody  And at one point  I got crazy  And I was like  You are the Coast Guard  And I am saying to you now  There's a submarine  Attacking lower Manhattan  I'm saying it  And they're like  We're trying to get  Park police over here  I'm like  Send a fucking helicopter  And he kept asking me to hover 
[01:45:30]  We kept hovering around it  And stuff  And then finally  This big police boat comes  And shines like  A massive light on it  And then he calls me  On the radio  Hey captain  Are you the one  Who reported this?  And I go  Yeah  And he goes  It's a mooring ball  It's been there since 1965  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down  You just hook up to it  And I go  What if you don't see it?  And the guy goes  Well most people navigating those waters  Know what the fuck they're doing  I have no business being on the water  And I would have hit it  If I hadn't stopped  At the Statue of Liberty  To show it off 
[01:46:00]  To Chris and them  Arrgh  Ha ha  Maybe not quite the adventure  You were looking for  Well shiver me timbers  And all that bullshit  Ah pigleg  This fucking parrot  Just took a shit on me  God damn it  All right  We're going to try to move on 
[01:46:30]  Even though the phone's still lit about religion  It's still lit  And I want to complain about my blueberries  I'm very mad  Jimmy has blueberries every day  They look amazing  He gives me a little bit  I'm very happy  What happened  So then I dip into the blueberry thing  And go  All right  Get me some blueberries  They're cloudy like me and Jimmy  You don't understand the blueberry  Like me and Jimmy  No  You don't understand the blueberry world  I don't  They need to be a little cloudy  Just a little bit  Where you can still see the blue sky behind it 
[01:47:00]  The blue sky  And these are  There's some trickery going on  Because I got the cloudy  Yeah  You see the cloudy  But they're mushy  How can they be cloudy and mushy?  Now I've heard the cloudy is good  The cloudy very good  But now  But you want it to be firm too  Mushy  Like a good  Yeah  A nice cloudy blue bouncy suckable smurf tit  I've never come across cloudy and mushy 
[01:47:30]  That doesn't make sense  That's almost impossible  Oh well  At least we're not in a hot air balloon  Oh that was  That's pretty  Roland wants me to go in a hot air balloon  In the next couple weeks  Why?  I think I'm going to have to say no now  Why?  Promotion for a movie or something  Really?  What?  Yeah  I could even bring my kid up in the hot air balloon  Oh that's something you want to do  I don't  Know why I don't want to do it?  There's no  There's no fail safe  There's no backup  Like if 
[01:48:00]  If a plane has an engine problem  He can make some moves  Yeah  Helicopter  You can make some moves  Yeah a little auto  If you're parachuting and something goes wrong  You can make a couple moves  Give it a whirl  I think the hot air balloon  Is the only thing  You can't make any moves  If something goes wrong  Once that pocket of warm air  Right  That's lifting you up  Is breached  Yeah  It's over  It's over  There is nothing there  That's going to fucking help you  No look  From plummeting 
[01:48:30]  As we see the plummeting video  Yeah there it is  That has gone viral  Why'd they turn it sideways?  It was doing good  It was doing good  The camera  Yeah  Someone turned it sideways  They got all hip  World star hip hop  Yeah but you know what  The phone should be able to figure all that out for you  Yeah  If you go sideways  The phone should go  Oh I see  You want more  More space on your video  Okay  Sometimes you want that though  But why make it sideways then?  I mean the actual video is now sideways  Wow  What was that over Egypt? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah  18 people?  When it burst into flames  I want to say 70 feet in the air  That looks like more than 70  No no no no  But the  Seven stories up  Okay  And the pilot and one of the tourists  Jumped out  Nice  And because the pilot abandoned ship  The fucking balloon began rising  Went up to like a thousand feet  So it went up another few hundred feet  But the pilot's not stupid  He knows if this thing's on fire  His only hope is to jump before it gets too high  Yeah when the pilot jumps out  You should go too 
[01:49:30]  You should just follow him right  Absolutely  Yeah  Did the pilot survive?  I don't know  Oh he did?  He did yeah  He survived the 70 foot fall  Yeah a pilot and somebody else survived jumping out  It might have been lower 60 feet  They said about the height of a seven story building  Wow  Which  Yeah hit a power line  Caught  The basket caught on fire  Oh is that what happened?  Yeah  Basket caught on fire  The pilot jumps out  Another guy jumps out  They live  So why can't  With some injuries  Why can't  Oh sorry  Sorry  Just because of the weight 
[01:50:00]  Yeah the weight difference now  The basket's lighter  Because two men are out of it  So it starts going up  And everybody's in there  With a flaming basket  Like that  And then finally the flames  Got onto the balloon part of it  And popped it  And  I got a couple questions  And it plummeted  So  Terrible  The pilot should have stayed in there  And he would have been able to get that  Maybe not  Maybe not  Okay  They all should have jumped out  And then  Why isn't everyone bum rushing the fire?  The fire  You know  It's right there  I don't know 
[01:50:30]  It must have been freaking out  How bad was the fire?  I'm sure they tried to put it out  It was probably a big fucking fire  Right away  It might have started in the bottom  Maybe  If it hit the power line  It probably started under them  Yeah maybe it was outside the thing  On the bottom of the basket  I don't know  Yeah good point  Sounds  Pretty scary  Outside the basket  In a place where you just can't get at it  And you're fucked  Yeah  How high were  Hold on  Let's see how high they were  Would you like to fly?  No  It also 
[01:51:00]  Even the people that jumped  Had 70% burns  Burns  Really?  On their bodies  Yeah  The people who jumped?  You said yeah  There was a hell of a fire  The two people that survived  A British tourist  And the Egyptian pilot  70% burns  Were the only people  That have survived  So they didn't just go  Fire!  Ah!  Jump!  They probably were  You know  Trying something  Saw that  This is  You know  I'm getting burned up over here  Yeah we're gonna burn  We have 30%  Until we're burned to death  Yeah this is futile  And then it went up in the air  To a thousand feet or whatever 
[01:51:30]  I mean that's just  So the rest of the people  Probably were burned  They were on fire  When they were falling  Yeah  They were on fire  A lot of them were on fire  Horrible  Horrible  Horrible  Terrible death  Oh my god  What a dumb invention  The balloon was a great invention  Back in the day  But you know  It was the first  You know what?  Yeah it was the first time  You got to go above a city or something  Go wow  Check this shit out  Look down  You're going like  Fuck that's pretty cool  Who's that?  Man I know her  She's fucking  Yeah  That's Mary Lou Trudgel 
[01:52:00]  Thanks Jim  What the hell do I know?  Pretty girl  You know  It's too young for me  You and I  Turn this shit up  This is  Oh watch us die  Oh come on  We wanna fly  On fire so high  In my muzzy balloon  This is a child of the 80's shit  Right here  Yeah  Yes it is  This is  Your fifth dimension  No way

Not beautiful  I would say this is  Nineteen 
[01:53:00]  Eight  Sixty  Eight  It's right  Is it 68?  Yeah  It's 67  67  Yeah alright  So  Why'd you say right here?  Well I'm seeing the Grammy thing here  That's right  So when I  When I was growing up in the 80's  Okay  Yeah this was like a  Song that was on the radio  On the 60's channel  Yeah  In the 80's  In the 80's  It was just on AM  AM always played old shit  This just reminds me of driving  Not driving  But being in a car  Being driven by my dad 
[01:53:30]  The Rambler  The old Rambler  And I was in the back seat  And this would be playing  And my dad and mom  Would be yelling at each other  In the front seat  While this song was playing  Oh yeah yeah  Anytime I hear  Like this song  And other songs  From like  That era  I just think of my parents  Screaming at each other  And I'm thinking  They're gonna kill each other  God you had a horrible  Soundtrack growing up  Oh yeah  Do they do the Aquarius one too?  Oh thank you Don 
[01:54:00]  It's Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr.  Were in this  Okay  Marilyn McCoo  And Billy Davis Jr.  Where do I know Marilyn McCoo from?  She did a song  Oh I'm just thinking of a word  That you use a lot  That sounds like that  Sorry  And they do Age of Aquarius too?  Yes  Oh wow  This is the dawning  Yeah yeah yeah  This is a good song  Aquarius  Yes  What year is this?  1968  Ish 
[01:54:30]  Yeah  Yeah I think this one was playing  When the car broke down  In front of the mental hospital  And my dad had to go up  To get water  Because the radiator was  Like overheating  And I was doing nothing  But screaming and crying  Because I was afraid  And my dad was doing nothing  But telling me to shut up  And telling my mother  To shut me the fuck up  What were you afraid of?  That it was dark out  And the car didn't work  It just broke down  And then dad  And dad leaving the car 
[01:55:00]  Like he was walking away  I was sure he wasn't coming back  That is a big deal though  Yeah  Having your dad walk away  Oh it was terrible  At night  Shut him up bro  You're coddling him  Yeah  Alright  I need coddling  Not anymore  No  I don't need anything  They were always on  Variety shows  Fifth Dimension Day  Is going well  Yeah  I'm feeling it  They were always on 
[01:55:30]  Those 60s and 70s  Variety shows  Yeah  Yeah  There was a big fat black guy  What like  Flip Wilson  Yeah yeah yeah  Exactly  Well Flip Wilson maybe  And they would sing this  And they'd you know  Ooh they'd do like  In the moon  And then their hands  Would go up  Yeah  Ooh  This um  I believe from the  Broadway production of Hair  Yeah of course  Is it?  Yeah  Yeah yeah okay  Alright  What year is this song though?  It was  Well Hair was  Came out in 67 
[01:56:00]  And then Fifth Dimension  Released this  This is just from my memory  As a single  Oh  In 1969  Oh  Nice  I know it's out of character  But I kind of like  Fifth Dimension Day  That's an amazing  Oh you like  Fifth Dimension Day?  It's an amazing harmony  What a chorus that is  Wait why do you like  Fifth Dimension Day?  I like Fifth Dimension  I like these songs  You do like these songs  That's weird  Jazz hands  Yes  It's a lot of harmonies 
[01:56:30]  Going on there  Alright give us another  What do you rock?  I don't think  There's another one right?  You have to tell me  I don't know there's  I honestly don't know  Now it's the rockin' part  What goes into  Let the sunshine in  I don't know this part  I think the Brady Bunch  Did this on their variety  No I think  Oh they might have  I think they might have  Let the man's penis in  Is what he was saying  Shane  Oh yeah  But this should have been  A separate song  I hate what bands did this 
[01:57:00]  Went one into another  Yeah  It's from Hair  I know  This is fucking groovy  I think that was  Marilyn McCombin  Bill and David Steer  And it did  One Less Bell to Answer  Right?  Stop saying their names  One Less  Bell to Answer  One Less  Egg to Fry  One Less  Something like that?  I don't know that one  No?  Maybe if I heard it  Does it go back to  The Age of Aquarius part?  No  No this is it  This is pretty much it 
[01:57:30]  Do we have one more  Fifth Dimension song to play?  Oh  He Rock might have found it  Oh  This is ancient  What year is this?  What song is it?  I don't know  I don't know it yet  This is One Less Bell  One Less Bell  What the fuck do you know this?  How does he know this?  He's old  And he has a great memory  Yeah but this is  For nothing  Here's what he doesn't remember  Love and compassion 
[01:58:00]  But he remembers  Fucking song chords  From 1967  While he was having an elbow  On his fucking face  In a rambler  I remember hits  This one  Was this a big hit?  This is a pretty big hit  I don't remember this at all  1970  70  Alright  I remember this too  Yes I do have vivid memories  Of the late 60s  And early 70s  As a very young child  I don't know why  It was very frightening 
[01:58:30]  I was always petrified  I know  I was a petrified kid  Yeah exactly  Like a poodle  That just shook all the time  Yes I was like  That fucking  Little chihuahua  That shakes and pisses  On the floor  And now you're still  That chihuahua  But you wear a big  St. Bernard costume  Someone's just  A little chihuahua  In a big doggy costume  In a giant dog house  All alone  With little biscuits  That fire bullets  All comes out in the end  What are you gonna do 
[01:59:00]  Right  I don't know  I know a lot of these songs  From my older sister  Yeah  My older sister  Is six years older than me  And she was cranking out  That AM radio  Oh Dawn's got another one  Yeah  You don't have to be  A star  Baby  They sang that too  To be in my show  Is that 5th Dimension  I think that's  Marilyn McCool  And Billy Davis Jr  I'm still talking about  That's not called  Marilyn McCool  Like you fucking  Went to high school with them  Is it Tom Skerritt  Tom Skerritt  So they had it 
[01:59:30]  With the 5th Dimension people  And said fuck that  Yeah  Let's do it all ourselves  They decided  They were gonna continue  Yeah  Do something  You think they'd look  At each other  When they were all  Flying coach  Go well you know  They're 60 or whatever  We gotta fly your coach  And then Billy and fucking  Marilyn would look at each other  And go what the fuck  What the fuck is this shit  We could get first clown  We could get first clown  I know this one  A little disco sound  This has to be a little later  74  What is it 73  I guess 74  I'm saying 73  You always like to be difficult  I don't know  It's 72 obviously  Is it 
[02:00:00]  Yeah  76  76  Oh that was a little more disco  Marilyn McCool  And Billy Davis Jr  Had a pretty good career there  In the 70's  Marilyn McCool  Was murdered  What  I don't remember that  No I'm just telling you  What I jerked off  Thinking about  Oh  Dumb joke  Now I don't  Need no  Superstar  Cause I'll accept you 
[02:00:30]  As you are  Yeah  I'm sure she wrote that lyric  While a fucking postal worker  Was sticking his dick in her  You don't have to be a star  Yep  Oh boy  76  Reminds me of  The Bicentennial  When I came back to New York  From California  Nom  Yeah  Came back from the nom  Where the last guy's out  Yeah  I came back from California

[02:33:00]  Another African American  Contribution to enrich our lives  For Black History Month  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  We got Kevin Hart in the studio  Who's hosting SNL  And I gotta say  He's hosting SNL  He comes in  And the first thing he does  Is make fun of Rich Foss  I love Kevin Hart  And he also  Makes fun of my workout regimen  Yes  I think that's the problem  Why do you work out this early?  Kevin Z wakes up  And it works out  Why? 
[02:33:30]  This early  Well because early in the morning  Is when you get your day started  Man and it's how you  It's how you kick everything off  So basically  You can't get up  And get dressed  And go to work  And be relaxed  And then say  Oh I'm gonna work out  Because then you're gonna be tired  Doesn't make sense  Jim is backwards  It's pretty stupid  I don't know  Because then I  Feel like you get more tired  After working out  And then  You can't do anything  Well we don't have  Judging by your bodies guys  You've been doing this wrong  We've been doing it wrong  All these years  You guys are definitely  There's no change  But say our system needs tweaking 
[02:34:00]  I'm jacked  But we also get up  In the middle of the night too  So what  We're supposed to get up  At 3.30 to work out  The gym is closed  Where are we going?  Yeah we don't have a gym  That's open Kevin Hart  I'm sorry  Yeah  We're doing the best we can  I just realized  About my life just now  Yeah exactly  We don't have a trailer  With a gym in it  I have a personal trainer sir  It's wonderful  No I'm just like  Working out early  You get it out the way  Get it out the way  Yeah  And then you got  The rest of your day  How long do you work out for? 
[02:34:30]  An hour and a half  Do you?  Wow  Is that including cardio?  Yes  So I don't do  I do a nice hour  A nice even hour  Hour and five  A nice even hour  I would pay good money  Just to watch the gym  In the gym  I'd love it  It's probably awful  You don't sweat  Oh I do  It's hard to sweat though  Yeah  I have kind of  A slug makeup  It's just noises  As he gets up and down  From the equipment  Jimmy keeps his hood on  I work out  At the same place Jimmy does 
[02:35:00]  He keeps his hood on  Why?  Nobody's gonna bother you  No it's not  It's to help me sweat  Because I don't sweat  It helps me sweat  You don't sweat  Because you don't work out  That's why you don't sweat  That's impossible Jim  If you go and really work out  You're gonna sweat  But I've never been a sweaty guy  My body is just  Naturally athletic  So for me  I have to put that  Extra effort in  Today's ab day  I'll do abs  And Jimmy's lost  A lot of weight  Yeah  No he has lost weight  We're trying to encourage him  He looks good  I'll always 
[02:35:30]  Kick him down  At his worst moment  I'll still kick him down  My arms are just getting  To be a little bit buff  That's what feels good  No no no  I don't think you're ever  Going to get definition  I think you're going to  Keep losing weight  And then your skin  Is just going to get loose  Do you know  I'll stand in the mirror  Sometimes  And when the shadows  Are just right  I can see the outline  Of where the abs  Are gonna be  You can see it  Gonna be  But when I turn the light  Fully on it just goes away  But if the shadow is right  I can see that  There will be abs there 
[02:36:00]  There's some hope  There's hope there  My ab workout  Is very very good  No that's pretty  That's pretty insane  Let me tell you something  My friend Wayne  That's outside  I bet him  I made a bet with him  Crazy bet  Wayne was about  Three  Three twenty  He was just huge  So when he sleeps  He has sleep apnea  So like he  It was bad  Like on the planes  It was just crucial  So I was like  Yo if you don't lose weight  You're gonna die  So I made a bet  Crazy amount of money  I gave him three months 
[02:36:30]  To lose forty pounds  He's lost sixty five pounds  Ouch  So now  You should not pay him  Because he lost more than  You should not pay him  No I paid him  I said forty  I actually paid him  But the funny thing is  Like throughout his workout  Because I'm such a jerk  Like in the middle of the night  I was sent double cheeseburgers  To him  Oh man  I would go to like  A fast food place  To buy a bunch of stuff  Knock on his door  And run  So  The food would just be outside  Like  Yo  Send chocolate cakes  And puddings 
[02:37:00]  To his food  It was the best  Like he  I don't know if he would  Eat it or not  But like  Some mornings  It would be out there still  Some days it wouldn't  So  I was just trying to  Make him cheat  To get off of the diet  Because he was getting close  But now he just won't stop  He's a workout fool now  You get addicted to it  He's drinking the shakes  With peanut butter in them  Oh yeah  Oh shit  Are those good for you  Or no  I love them  I don't know  Gotta go skim milk  Banana  Yeah he's doing all that stuff  Is that free yogurt in there  All that shit  All that stuff  Did his sleep apnea go away  Yeah  See it can go away 
[02:37:30]  No look  It got to the point  We were on a plane  We were on planes  So he's sitting next to people  And like  Before we would take off  We would have to make  An announcement  Like  We would act like  We were playing  But it was serious  Hey look  Yeah yeah yeah  Hey my friend snores man  It's gonna be bad  Oh shit  Like dude  That's literally  Before take off  It's gonna be bad people  And I know you paid  Good money for these seats  I don't want you thinking  That you weren't warned  So  If you don't have headphones  You're gonna have to  Figure it out  Wow  Yeah yeah  So literally  Literally like  Forty minutes into the flight 
[02:38:00]  You would  Like  He would get up  In a disgust  On people's face  Cause  He's so loud  Pissed off at him  He would just be so mad  But  He's so big  You're scared to wake him  Yeah  Could you sleep next to him  No  No  I would headphones it up  My goal was to be sleep  Before the take off  So I didn't have to worry about it  But one day  This white guy  Woke him up  He got mad  Don't you touch me  He just woke up and snapped  Like  Holy shit  His first reaction 
[02:38:30]  Wow  Like he's dead asleep  So the guy was like  Just tapped his arm  And he's like  Don't you touch me  Oh my god  Imagine  All you hear is me laughing  In the back  Of course  Of course  Trying to get a picture  With my phone  Of course  So I can send it to him  Ah you snapped on the white man  On the plane  This is when you told him  Don't touch you  Remember  What does Wayne do  Is he a security detailer  Is he a manager  No  Wayne started off  As my security  And then I figured out  That Wayne was brilliant 
[02:39:00]  With computers  So Wayne is in charge  Of my social media branding  So  Any income that comes  From the internet  At all  From advertising  From promotion  Production  Wayne does all of it  Nice  What I do is put people  In position to win  Jim  That's good  It's kind of like  A genius move  On my part  Because I  Tapped into a talent  That he didn't even  Know he had  Sure  See Wayne was supposed  To play professional football  He got tired of doing  Security for someone  That no one was rushing up to  This is a boring job 
[02:39:30]  I don't need me  He was meant to play  Professional football  Yeah let me give you  The story of Wayne  Right here  You guys gotta see  Wayne's face  Well he's in with  E-Rock right now  Where is Wayne  Where is he  Just tell him  You just gotta see his face  When I tell you  E-Rock  Can you show Wayne  Where we are  I can't see him  You can't see him  No  You don't see him  He's big  There's no way not to see him  I saw him  He's a big guy  Big guy  Yes  So Wayne  Right  I'm gonna tell you  How dumb  And smart  My friend is  So Wayne  Went to 
[02:40:00]  Mask Bomb University  Wayne I'm telling the story  Hey Wayne  Hey Wayne  Of how Wayne  Of how you were supposed  To be a professional  Football player  Wayne  I'm telling him  How you're down  60 something pounds  Right now  I'm gonna show them  A picture of you  When you were disgusting  So they can see  The difference  Of how I saved your life  I saved his life  So Wayne  He was a high school  Phenomenon  Football player  Right  A tight end  Okay  Recruited heavily  By Miami University  Holy shit  Yeah no  Crazy amazing school  Right  Somehow Temple University 
[02:40:30]  Also sent Wayne a letter  And Wayne decided  Not to go to Miami University  To go to Temple University  Because he felt like  He could change the program  Yeah  Now  Wow  Here's the thing  No amazing  Amazing thought  If you're a quarterback  Or a running back  And you actually  You actually  Can get the ball  And do amazing things  But when you're a tight end  You don't really control  Your destiny  Right  They're not a program  That caters to tight ends  So Wayne found himself 
[02:41:00]  At Temple University  For four years  Or three years  And scored one touchdown  Oh Wayne  That's only one more  Than I scored  Oh  And then Wayne  It got to the point  Where Wayne became the guy  Who just wanted to be  On the ESPN  So when other people scored  The goal was to run down  To the end zone  And jump on those people's backs  And smack their helmets  And that's what Wayne did a lot  And then  Oh my god  It did Wayne 
[02:41:30]  Decided to give football up  He felt that he wasn't  Going to make it  To the NFL  And I said  You're my friend man  Come be secure  With me man  You don't have to wear a helmet  As good as being in the NFL  Yeah  Then he figured out  This is stupid  Because like you said Jim  He wasn't doing nothing  Nobody was even talking to me  At this time in my life  This is at the beginning  Where technically  I didn't need security  But it was a way for me  To have my friend around  Yeah sure  And then after that  I figured out that he was a genius 
[02:42:00]  So the moral to the story is  He spent all those years  Working on a goal  That he would never achieve  Which was football  Which was football  Computers man  He's a computer genius  He didn't figure it out  Until later in his life  Wayne you got a before picture  I can't find one  Because I'll tell him  How crazy he did  Now your sleep apnea  Totally went away  Yeah  And do you use a mask at all  I used to use a mask  But not anymore  Did it work for you 
[02:42:30]  The mask  I didn't really like it  He felt that  He felt that it made him  Yeah I can't use it  He's like yeah man  I don't want it  Because some girls  See me with it  Or something at night time  Well that's what  A lot of guys think though  With that crap  Once you bang her  Who cares  That's the beauty of it  But then you put the mask on  After you come  You're like ha ha  But then you turn into Bane  Yeah  That's the best  Really Punisher  Really make it hurt  And you turn into  To the creepiest guy ever  Yeah 
[02:43:00]  To the disgusting  Creepiest  Ha ha  Look you picked me  Exactly  I'm a mutant  Look who you just slept with  You're even a bigger zero  Than I am  I can't imagine  Wayne being bigger  No  Wait till you see this picture  He looks like he's  In really good shape  Wait till you see this picture  Now what's the difference  Between Miami University  And Miami and Temple  As far as  Miami University  I don't know  Miami University  Is just number one  In football for years  Miami's always been  A great program  Temple has always been  An awful program  What made you  Like you really thought  In my mind 
[02:43:30]  I really had the power  To change the program  Yeah  But what made you  Oh because Temple called you  You kind of figured  They really want me  I can go there  I was familiar with  Their positions coach  Oh  So I knew him  And I knew he was  A good coach  So I wanted to go  You know under him  Oh okay  And he didn't get injured  Or anything  No  No injuries  At any time  Did you think about transferring  No  I did  I did think about transferring  After I realized  It was a mistake  Healthy as odds  It was too late  Wow  His highlight  Was that good in high school  You were like one of the 
[02:44:00]  One of the top guys  In your position in high school  Yeah  Wow  Look at this  Are you over the football thing  Oh wow  Yeah  I'm way over it  He's big right there  Wow  Fuck  Jesus  That's the same guy  Yeah  Holy fuck  Good for you Wayne  That's not even the worst one  No that's not the worst one  There's one where you can see  A little bit of his stomach  At the bottom of his shirt  Which is pretty disgusting  Yeah  That's a bad look  He was kind of hanging out  Just for no reason  One day  While he was sitting down  We don't tell you  We take pictures  Yeah  And then we send it to you 
[02:44:30]  To your face  At the bottom  Put ill  You're the worst guy  To be out of shape around  Because you just say it  It's like people  There's a social politeness  That Kevin doesn't display  He just doesn't have it  Yeah but like  When you walked in the studio  One day  I said hey man  You're like  Your face is getting fat  I'm like  But he was right  That was the hello  Yeah but that was it  That was the bottom  He was right  That's your hello  Yeah  That was it  How do you have friends  He doesn't  But he's a good motivational  My friends love me man  That's what I'm about  I'm about to change  I remember  Listen this is  The first time I saw Bobby 
[02:45:00]  He was big again  So the last time I saw him  He had lost weight  So I was like  Oh Bobby you look good man  Damn you really look good dude  Whatever you're doing  Keep it up  So then  Like a year goes by  And I see him at the airport  And I'm like  God damn it Bobby  What are you doing man  That's the last thing  He doesn't want to hear that  No he ain't  He just  Couldn't get his words out  I know  He dropped the muffin  While he was talking to me  He was so upset  Something came out of his pocket 
[02:45:30]  I was like  What is that  Is that snacks  In your pocket  Yeah  Yeah  That's where I'm playing  Mike  Pipe up  Well seen it  Poor Bob  He's going to be a father too  I know  I know  He tweeted  He tweeted  Fucking pork dumplings  Last night  And then  Was crowing about  How many points  It is on Weight Watchers  It's like  I don't care  Pork dumplings 
[02:46:00]  No matter what  Can't be good for you  It's not going to  Just because it comes  To the Weight Watchers box  You can't spin pork dumplings  There's nothing worse  Than seeing the person  And understand this  People  I don't want people  To think that I'm like  The biggest asshole  To people who are overweight  It's just my way  Of motivating my friends  At the end of the day  You can die  It's serious  So I had to use money  To entice him  To change  So I had to give him  A crazy amount of money  As a goal  And now 
[02:46:30]  I accomplish that  By making him work out  And fall in love  With some nice change  But  It's  It's nothing funny to me  I want to know how much  I gave him 10 grand  10 grand back  But then he got bonuses  I put bonuses in there  Holy shit  So if he got  Passed  If you got 50  If you got 50 pounds  Yeah it was 15  15 for 50 pounds  If he got 15  I had to give him  An extra 5 grand  So it was 10 grand  If he got the 50  I had to give him  An extra 5 grand  So he got to like  60 something  So I gave him 15 grand  6,000 back immediately  Yeah and I told him  Give me 6,000 back 
[02:47:00]  He was in Vegas  And I was losing  Give me 6,000 back  Yeah fuck that  I'll try to get it back  To you  Eventually  Is that a demon for you  Gambling  Is that a rough one  No  You don't do it  No I don't have the time  I don't have the time  After you take a couple  Severe rapings out there  It's very hard to go  You know what man  I want some more of this  After you leave the table  Scratching your head  And thinking about  What you could have did  With that money  That's the car  Right there  I was just talking about it  Alright well 
[02:47:30]  Thank you  And you get over the table  You still trying to talk  To the pit bosses  Because you feel like  At any point  They can say  Do you want some of this back  You're just waiting  For the segue  Into your money back  So you guys  Y'all here every day  Right  This is cool  This is cool man  You guys are cool  The whole time  You see I'm not the guy  That gets an attitude  About losing either  I just sit down  I don't disrespect the dealers  Nothing  You're saying everything nice  Waiting for him  To say something to you  Yeah  Here's your money back  Yeah you've been cool

[02:48:30]  And fucking  Look and she would point  And smoke a cigarette  But she was betting  Like five ten grand a hand  Just losing  Like it got to the point  Where I was feeling bad  But I wasn't  Because I really didn't know  What she was saying  I was like  I wanted somebody there  To tell me  But she kept pointing  To the dealer  The dealer was just  The dealer didn't say anything  They're unflappable  Those guys  Unflappable  They don't have fun gambling

This is huge  It is right?  This is huge man  Especially as a comedian  To have the chance  To be a part of  You know  This is history for me  You know  And writing my book 
[02:53:30]  And writing my path  This is a huge step  I talked to Lauren  Lauren for  Like two hours  Last night  We go to dinner  And literally just hearing  The information  The stories  And really understanding  The careers and lives  That he's affected  Like this  You know  When you think comedy  He's really been a part of  Putting  Putting today's names  That are huge  Monumental  In a theatrical sense 
[02:54:00]  Comedic sense  Improvisational sense  They came through him  So many people did  It's like  Just his eye for it  And him understanding the process  And why it takes so long  And he remembered that I auditioned  And didn't get it  Like  Oh shit  Why did you tell you  You didn't get it  I was awful  I was awful  What characters did you do  Listen  I did a  Okay let me tell you something  And I'm gonna probably  Talk about this in my monologue  So  I go  And I'm auditioning for SNL  And you know  They're like  You gotta do characters  But I'm like  I don't have any  Impressions 
[02:54:30]  I don't know how to  Do anybody  But you know  What characters do I do  I just didn't understand  The sense of characters  Now  I'm seasoned  So I know characters  I can be different people  And joke  Whatever  So I'm like  I guess I just gotta figure out  Some impressions  So I did an impression  Of Avery Johnson  Right  Which  Which I  I soon learned  That a lot of white people  Didn't know  I was just gonna ask you  Who's an actor  No he's a coach  He's a basketball player now  He used to be  Yeah  Basketball player  So I found out  Nobody know who  Avery Johnson was 
[02:55:00]  Which  Which made me a little  More angry  Cause I'm like  You know  If you knew who he was  You would know  How good of an impression  How good this is  Right  This is  I'm doing an impression  Of nobody  They're like  No we don't  We don't do it  So then after that  I tried to do like  Denzel  But it sounded like  Me doing Denzel  So  It was just  Bad  It was just bad  Maybe you should have  Started off a little  Less obscure  But my energy was great  Yeah  My energy was good  And I didn't have  Stage fright  I was just awful  And then he was like 
[02:55:30]  He said it's amazing  Basically to see me  Come as far as  I've came  With so little  To work with  Knowing that you  Have no  Knowing that you  Have no talent  At all  It's amazing  That you've gotten  This far  So wait  What was your  Denzel impression  Do you still do it  Oh my Denzel impression  Was just bad  You don't do it anymore  No  I told you  It's not even an impression  It's me saying  You remember when  Denzel said this  What's in my voice  Oh shit  Remember this  Small one from Denzel  Hey here's Denzel 
[02:56:00]  Training day  King Kong  Ain't got nothing  On me  That sounds like  You just saying  What he said  No  No that's Denzel  What year did you  Audition  Oh man this is like  2004  2005  It came down  Between me  And Dean Edwards  Dean Edwards got it  They never used  Dean right either  Because Dean did  An amazing rock  He did a great  Denzel Washington  He had some  Great impressions  Fantastic  And I think  That they did not  Use him properly  Or he didn't do  Like a great  Like a legit  Michael Jackson too  He didn't do  A hacky Michael Jackson 
[02:56:30]  He did a great one  Here's my  Funny Dean Edwards story  So the night  That he gets  SNL  He gets a call  And it was down  To me and him  Right  So I'm like  Oh man  I might get it  This is crazy  Oh shit  You know  Like Dave  My manager was like  Yeah Kevin  It was something  About you  That he liked  So you know  Your impressions  Weren't great  But you did  A good job  There is between  You and Dean Edwards  I'm like  Oh this is  Oh man  He's thinking  Like this could happen  This is gonna happen  This is gonna be  Biggest thing ever  So Dean Edwards  Gets the call 
[02:57:00]  He pulls me to the side  He's like  Yo man  He just called me  I got it  Now Dean is a friend of mine  So I'm happy  Like man  Congratulations Dean  This is huge for you man  This is gonna be great dude  So we go into the cellar  So me  Dean  Tracy Morgan  Big J  And I think  Keith might have been there too  We're all at the table  We're all eating  Dean just told everybody  Man congratulations  This is great  Chris Rock walks in  Chris comes in  Dean man I just heard  You got SNL  Man this is great  Congratulations man 
[02:57:30]  You gotta work hard though  You gotta write  Make sure you come in there  And you really put forth the effort  Tracy Morgan is at the other end  Of the table  He's eating  All you hear is Tracy's fork  It drops  It drops like bangs  Against his plate  Right  So Tracy goes  I wish I had somebody  To tell me shit like that  So Chris doesn't say anything  He just looks at Tracy  Right  Tracy says  And this is word for word  He says  I got blood on my knife  And shit on my walls 
[02:58:00]  What the fuck  Picks up his food  And starts eating again  And Chris goes  Stay away from him  Another good piece of advice  It just walks out  Listen  But after Tracy said  I got blood on my knife  And shit on my walls  So he said nothing else  And just  Just started eating  Just continued eating  Jesus  That was Dean Howard's advice  He speaks to these weird metaphors  Tracy  And they make sense to him  They make sense to him  I was talking  I was walking in the cell  One night  And Tracy's there  And I said hello to him 
[02:58:30]  And he goes  Gotta get that lunch pail  Go to work  Where do you want me  To go with that  Where do I go with that  Yeah you do  Hi Tracy  Good to see you again  It's nothing  It's nothing better  Than really  Talking to somebody  And you notice  That that person's weird  Like Roy Jones Jr  I met Roy Jones Jr  The other day  We've had him  So I'm like  Oh man Roy  Dude good to meet you  Big fan  Roy  Question for you man 
[02:59:00]  When you worked out  And you ran  What type of cardio did you do  Straight question  I just want to know  Right  He goes  4-2-2-2-4-4-4  4-4-2-2-4-4-4  4-2-2-2-4-4-4  Whoa  Alright  Thanks man  I don't know  What does that even mean  What are you telling me  I'll tell you two things  It means  One is that you're  Psychopathic to think  That you're actually  In good enough shape  To ask a boxer  The question of working out 
[02:59:30]  That an equal might ask him  What are you doing  For your eight pack  He sang a song  He sang a song to me though  My thing is  You didn't even answer the question  You just sang a riddle  He just  4-2-2-2-4-4-4  He did it three times  I'm doing it serious  It was like a moment  Of like just weird silence  And I was like  Alright man  I see you man  It's good seeing you  I just walked away  Maybe he didn't have time  He wanted you to call him  Maybe that was 
[03:00:00]  I don't know  I don't know what it was  Were those his times  Were those his running times  I don't know what it was  I don't know  I don't know what it was  I have no idea  4-2-2-4-4-4  What's the schedule  For us now  Is it as brutal as they say  Where you guys are  Just up all the time  Just trying to get it all together  It's late night  Yeah late night  So you start  You know  Mid-afternoon  And then you're going  To about 1 a.m  Wow  You know  12 a.m  But the good thing is  It's just creative  It's non-stop ideas 
[03:00:30]  Everybody's pitching  Everybody's coming  Because you know  Everybody has an equal chance  To get their sketches on  So there's a process  You know  You can't just go  And yours is going to be picked  You got to do it  And write it  And get it up  And then there's a room  Where we see what's good  What's not good  And then there's a chopping board  And some things make it  Some things don't  Then last minute changes  It's constant  Is it up to you to pick songs?  Or  I'm not  I can go in and say  What I like the most  But I think the strongest 
[03:01:00]  Overall sketches  For that particular episode  Or that night  Are the ones that  You ever hear somebody  Go like  Oh man  I'm going to tell you  It's funny  So the first day  You know  I go in the room  And I sit out  And I'm there with Lauren  And all of the cast  All of the writers  All come in my room  And everybody  Tells you the ideas  They have for you  So you got to sit there  It's about 40 people  Wow  But everybody's going  Through the process  And it's funny  Because some people's  Pictures are bombing  Like you know  But the thing is 
[03:01:30]  They let each other know  Like just like comedians  You know  Like  Somebody's like  Yeah  You can see people  Getting nervous  In the middle  When they see  It's not going well  So like  And that's when  You'll like  You know  You'll do it  And then come in  And then somebody  Yell out  Should have reversed it  Should have  Should have went  With the other one first  And closed with that  That shouldn't have  Been your closer  And they don't fake laugh  Though  No no no  That's better  It's all real  Good  All real  No fake laugh 
[03:02:00]  Like when an idea  Is genuinely funny  It's funny  But they're all  Just rough ideas  And literally  Like all the people  You can tell  Who are the writers  And who are the personalities  Because you know  The writers are very bland  Well it's like  You're a funny guy  So  This will work  Yeah  You'll go into  A little bar  And you'll talk  Right  But you're the guy  Who just repeats  What the other person says  And you do it  Louder than them  And then you get mad 
[03:02:30]  And then maybe  It's  Whatever  It's just an idea  That's how it ends  Have you pitched any  Like one you thought  Like hey  This should be kind of funny  Yeah  I had a couple  That I pitched out  Did it bomb  Or did it do okay  Nah  I'm pretty fucking  Amazing Jim  Well I think  You'll be a good host  I think Kevin  Will be a really good host  It's gonna be fun  This is gonna be fun  Christoph Waltz  Bieber  Like they're not stand ups  I mean have a stand up  This is going to be  A lot of fun  And it's my element  Like  This is what I love to do  So from the improv 
[03:03:00]  From the sketches  From literally  Creating these  These  These  These environments  And we're all  You know  We can be who we want to be  And he allowed me to bring  What I want to bring  To the table  And the live doesn't get you  Oh no  That makes it more exciting  Right right  That makes it more exciting  Yeah and it's not  It's not at all physically  Nauseating to hear him  Saying this is my element  This is where I  Oh Jimmy  I do think  I think he'll be a great host man  And I think that you'll pull a sketch  If a sketch isn't working  Because sometimes man  One thing they never do on that show 
[03:03:30]  And I admire it  Is they never  Wreck this sketch  When it's bombing  Which as a stand up  Is so hard  To not  Acknowledge the bomb  And you know how  We will get out of a bomb  By just acknowledging it  And mocking it  They stay in it  Fucking full steam ahead  They never break  Sudeikis is really funny  He's been  He's been having me on the floor  Seth is smart man  Like you know  Yeah he's really good  He's one of the head writers  But he's  He's great  Like literally  Literally I respect  His work ethic  Kenan 
[03:04:00]  Kenan has had me laughing  A lot  And Bobby  Bobby's funny  But it's like literally  When you just see  The cast members  I had no idea  They literally  They create  Just as much as the writers  Just as much as the other show runners  Everybody is involved  In the creative process  Which I think is smart  Because you know  It makes everybody work hard  Because everybody is motivated  To get to  Yeah you have a piece of it  You know  It's pretty insane  I heard they're pretty welcoming there too  Because you're really going into a club  Where everybody is a member but you  And it's like  I heard  But I hear they're very good 
[03:04:30]  At making you comfortable  And feel welcome  The way that I feel now  I feel like  They're excited  I feel like they're excited  That I'm there  And there's like an energy  There's a great energy around  And nobody's  Nobody's been afraid  To present things to me  But what did  What did catch me off guard  Is like you know  At one point  You're really questioning  Your talent  Because when they sit you in the room  They're like  Hey Kevin  So real quick  We just want to know some things  Do you sing?  I'm like  No  No  I don't sing  Do you do any impersonations?  No  No  I don't have any impersonations 
[03:05:00]  You dance?  Nah  And you see them  Checking things  Oh man  I think we'll save some skits  For next week  I have no talent  What do you do?  I'm funny  I know how to do that  I think  That's pretty much it  Okay yeah  Well we  You know  We got some things  We'll figure it out  You see them writing  On a notebook  As they walk out  Oh boy  It's going to be a tough one  If you would have gotten it 
[03:05:30]  Years ago  When you auditioned  For it  Do you think you'd have done well?  Or like  Even at that time  Not with knowing what you know now  In hindsight  But then  Do you think you'd have fit in  Or been able to  That competitive  Because I've heard  It's very competitive  With sketches and stuff  I think  I know I'm a workhorse  So I would have literally  Put the work in  Right  To try and get to  You know  Whatever successful point  I could have reached  But you know  The writing and stuff  Would have been great 
[03:06:00]  For me  In doing that  Because I love to write  I love to create  But there's no telling  Where  Where I would have been  You know  As far as  Within the show  The success of the show  Because there's so many people  So right now  Well if they needed it  Denzel  They had you  You should have said yes  To all those questions  That would have been the greatest  You'd answer  Very well  Absolutely  I actually had a record come out  But there's a whole contract  Impressions  And then name people  That you just  It's impossible to do  It would have been the greatest 
[03:06:30]  S.O.L. ever  A really weird obscure person  Like you  Rosemary Clooney  Embarrassing  With that event man  And they write a big Denzel sketch  Or a big  I got nothing  No nothing  Nothing at all  Somewhere around Friday morning  They knew they were in deep trouble  Nothing at all  You stink at all  I've been avoiding  I've been avoiding the rehearsals  All right  Yeah  Hey Kev  So you want to do the Denzel thing  I just kind of rather wait  To do it on the day  Yeah  I think to really give it up now  Spontaneous  Yeah I like being spontaneous  I want y'all to laugh  And like you've just seen it 
[03:07:00]  For the first time  Oh they're horrible  Trust me on this  Yeah trust me guys  All right  Kev you want to read the cue cards  Or anything now  Unless everything  Let's just save it for the day  On a day  It's just a train wreck  I got nothing  Nothing at all  My Denzel is horrible  Oh that would be fucking great  Kev Korg  He got nothing on me  Who is that  What's he doing  Why is he yelling  Asking me to dance  I'm tap dancing  I got tap dance shoes  Just bad  This is awful  That would be terrible 
[03:07:30]  I'm doing noises  I'd watch it  Kevin  Oh what's he doing up there  We're all watching this Saturday  Yeah this is one  This one we're watching  I never watch SNL  No I'll be watching  I think you'll do great  We watched Louie's  Louie was very funny  And I'm sure that you'll be  You'll be great at it  I can't wait  Oh fuck  The cue cards  Are you worried about the cue cards  Or no  No  You don't care  I don't care  Because a lot of times  You'll see them look up  But again they're pretty good  At not giving away  That they're 
[03:08:00]  Well too  You know  The schedule is so crazy  That you know  Even with the cue cards  Stuff and the show being live  And it being last minute decisions  Once you know  What you're doing  The people that are part of those things  Are kind of locked into it  So you know the beats of it  So even if the cue cards are there  You know the ballpark  Of where you're supposed to be  So you just stay within that vicinity  If it ever looks like it's  Oh I don't remember  Yeah  Cue card guys could fuck you over though man  Yes they could  If they don't like you  They'll just like  You know  Take their time  A little slow turn 
[03:08:30]  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  A little slow turn  Who put a question mark  On the teleprompter  No  They definitely could  But you know  Once again  If you're involved  With what it's supposed to be  You see everything go down  From all the changes  You should pay them off  Before Saturday  Just make sure they're well fed  Dude I'm really hyped  As if this is a basketball game  Right on man  I'm pumped up  What is the  Two other things to talk about too  One is the  Celebrity All-Star game  You did  What did you do 
[03:09:00]  With Usain Bolt  Oh I beat him  Going up and down the court  I challenged him to a race  But we had to dribble the basketball  Oh with a  Okay  So basically  Him dribbling  So you just throw the ball  Out in front of you  But you gotta keep bouncing the ball  So I smoked him  I set a world record  Come on  Really  Yeah  Well we don't  There's no way to prove it  But there's no way to say  There's no way to say  You didn't either  There's no way to say  I didn't either  At the end of the day  I beat the world record holder  Which means I probably set a record  He's an amazing athlete  Oh my god  To see him run  Ridiculously fast 
[03:09:30]  Unbelievable  Ridiculously fast  You have to see the guys  That just have so much  Athletic ability  But it's like  They don't know what to do  With certain stuff  Like he can't really  Play basketball  But he can run and jump  Real high  So for unnecessary reasons  He's jumping above the room  It's like  No no  You're saying  You have to shoot first  You don't jump  You do it with the ball  Just taps the ball  On the backboard  And lands with it  He has no idea  About the game  But then he just dunked  Like it was 
[03:10:00]  It was crazy  He's an athlete  Wow  And you know  I mean  Here's the thing  It's a two time MVP  I'm not sure  If you're aware of this  I was not aware of that  But I'm happy to hear it  Yeah it's just  Whatever  Who are you the MVP  In or the celebrity  It's never been done  Whatever  Two times  You're the first one  To get two times  Yeah  It's never been done  Maybe they think  It could be done  No  No  I think you know  After achieving  Such an accomplishment  You know  They're like  Well do you want to  Come back next year  And it's like  Well how much better  Can it get  I've won twice  The more valuable play  I have two amazing trophies 
[03:10:30]  So  Very humble about it  Get a third  I mean if Daniel Day-Lewis  Can do it  There's no reason  You shouldn't have a third  You know  I'm thinking about it  You gotta go first  I mean it's just tough  At the end of the day  It's a fun time  And I think  I'm taking the fun out of it  Right  By continuing to  Involve myself  And win  By dominating so much  Well it's beyond domination  Yeah  It's beyond domination  Who else played this year  I don't think  I didn't get to watch  I don't think  I don't think  I'll go through  Oh maybe that's  Yeah who else did play  Who else  John Goodman  Right  Betty White 
[03:11:00]  Who was out there  Come on  Y'all found out  Cross Betty White over  Oh Betty  I bust your ass  Who played  Trey Songz  Neo  Common  The guy  Joss Hutcherson  From Hunger Games  Terrence  From  The E  Network  They had some people  Out there  That you would never  Associate with athletics  But then after that 
[03:11:30]  They had some NBA players  Like the older guys  That retired as well  Like Dikembe Mutombo  Was on my team  It was funny  It was a good time  It was fun  Did he used to live  In our building Mutombo  Did he play for the Knicks  Or the Nets at all  No  Or was it Manute  One of those guys  Lived in our building  Manute Bull  Just black guys  That are tall  No was he one of those  Why should I think  That it's two different people  It was either Dikembe  Or Manute  One of those players  It was one of the tall  Long weapons  It could have been  Manute Bull  It might have been  Dikembe Mutombo  You would have known  It was Manute  Did Dikembe play 
[03:12:00]  For Jersey  Or the Knicks  I don't think so  Then he might have been  Here for something else  Because I saw him  In the garage  And they said  Yeah that's him  What if he was just  Visiting somebody Jim  Well they said  That they had got his call  There's a chance  That he could have  Just been making the stop  I met Manute Bull once  It was unbelievable  How fucking tall  This guy was  And how thin  At the same time  It was ridiculous  Like the Close Encounters  Alien that came out  Of the ship  At the end of it  Right  Yeah  He had the longest  These arms were  Like toothpicks 
[03:12:30]  And ridiculously long  It was really long  And past me  I met Dikembe's son  His son was 13  His son is 6 feet  Wow  Does he have skills?  I'll tell you  That's because of his dad though  Guy who  Does he have the skills though?  He said his son is good  His son is good  He said his son is good  Listen  I've now thought  My son is at the age  Where he can play  He can play basketball  So you know  Because of  Where I live  I can get my son 
[03:13:00]  Into like the great programs  Basketball programs  So you get there  It's all these NBA players  And their kids  But these guys  Their kids  Have natural talent  So at the age 5  You're looking  And you're like  Wow  And then my son  He's out there  And he's got two  Two left feet on  Like he's not even  Putting his sneakers on  Right  He doesn't bounce the ball  He's just messing up the game  My son is literally  Destroying the fundamentals  Of the game  There's no  You can totally look out there  And see who my son is 
[03:13:30]  Every time  And these other kids  Are really  Amazing  At the age 5  But a lot of the sons  Don't make it to the NBA  I'm surprised by that  Dude  A lot of them don't  But a lot of them  Go far in the sport  A lot of them  At least get to college  For free  Right  A lot of these guys  Get scholarships  For college  Yeah Rick Barry  Had a bunch of sons  Obviously  I can't think of many guys  That had their sons  In the NBA  Right now  Do you know any  Right now  Yes a lot right now  Right now  Del Curry  Del Curry  Okay  Steph Curry  Is in the NBA  And his other son  Is playing for Duke 
[03:14:00]  Who else  Is really really good  That's playing  My friend  That plays for Syracuse  With  Wayne left out  Meeks  I forgot Meeks  Last name  I know about a good  Five  Five black guys  Whose kids are in the NBA  Okay  Doing well  Kyrie Irving's dad  Played too  I believe  Yeah I don't  Look I'm a sports guy  I don't  Kobe Bryant  Kobe Bryant  We forgot about the big one  Jelly Bean  Jelly Bean was in the NBA  Was he  Yeah but he  He had more success 
[03:14:30]  In Europe  Yeah  He was more  He was overseas  I went to basketball camp  With Kobe  Did you really  Yes I did  Wow  My style basketball camp  Kobe played  The whole camp  Left handed  I'm very serious  What year is this  This is in  This is my junior year  So probably 1996  So he  Oh he was just a young guy  Yeah  That much better  Better than everybody  Oh my god  He dominated the whole camp  Left handed  Literally  He'd never  He worked on his left hand  The whole hand  Didn't use  Didn't shoot with his right hand  Is that what he was trying to do 
[03:15:00]  Just work on his left  Working on his left hand  He had specific instructions  To work on your left hand  Wow  So he played the whole basketball camp  MVP of the camp  Average 27 points a game  Something like that  He shoot left handed  Everything  Left hand  Jump shots  Layups  So do you know him now  Do you remember him from that  Oh okay  Yeah we both  We laugh about it  LaSalle basketball camp  Overnight basketball camp  And that's when I thought  I was going to the NBA  Wow shit  That's what  I've had a basketball dream  That's what  Muggsy Bogues really really 
[03:15:30]  Deluded a lot of  Fucking small people  He did  Yeah I had a real  Basketball dream  I'm not  I wish I could sit up here  And say that  I'm not one of those people  That used to be my speech  Kevin you sure  You gonna go to the NBA  Let me tell you something  You think that they  Told Muggsy Bogues  That he wasn't  Gonna make it  I had every small person  Biography  I knew everything  Spud Webb  Earl Boykins  I knew them all  How far did you get  To my senior year  In high school  And that letter  From community college  Kind of set me straight  Yeah I'm gonna probably 
[03:16:00]  Get recruited by Duke  And you know  A bunch of people  Community college  Sent me a letter  After I figured out  I got a 600 on my SAT  Oh shit  Wow  After I did  Abba Cadabba  For my SAT  A-B-A  A-B-A-C-A-D-A  A-B-A  C-A-T-A  A-B-A  C-A-T-A  Yeah I was  I was an idiot  I was like  Man we gotta take  This SAT test  Me and my friend  Was there  So we get there  And it was like  Alright it's gonna be  Three hours  So you guys  Take your time  Three hours 
[03:16:30]  I ain't staying  No three hours  It's Saturday  A-B-A-C-A-B-A  A-B-A-C-A  That's classic  It was a great idea  So you get your scores back  And everybody's in your class  And they're saying  Your scores out loud  Kevin 622  God damn it  Kevin you got a 622  You get 400  For putting your name  On the baby  It was Saturday  I didn't think  It was that serious guys  I didn't really take it  That serious  Your whole future  Is on that one test  A whole future  I was totally oblivious to it  What is your show  Is doing very well  We were talking 
[03:17:00]  When Kev first came in  On BET  You're doing really really well  Real Husbands of Hollywood  Currently number one show  On cable man  It's killing right now  We uh  I got  I think we're at like  2.2 million viewers  Jeez  A week  Which is great  An episode  Which you know  For BET  It's huge  BET was at like  300,000  A little bit over  For the show  Are you cocky  When you're in the BET meetings  No man  I don't  I'm only like that  With my friends  I don't display that  Oh I would be  I don't display that  You would 
[03:17:30]  Yes  If I basically  Took the audience  Seven times  What they normally get  No no  It's definitely an amazing  It's an amazing feeling  Because  Because I can say  That I took a chance  And gambled  On taking a show  To BET  And giving it to BET  But this is why  I did it  Same thing with Chappelle  Chappelle  The Chappelle show  Comedy Central  Was already a great network  Yeah yeah yeah  The Chappelle show  Took off so amazingly  Like everybody was like  Oh Comedy Central  Comedy Central  Because they wanted to see 
[03:18:00]  Chappelle show  So right now  Because of my show  And the success  BET is getting  So much attention  And everyone's like  Oh BET you gotta come in  And tune in  For blah blah blah  So it's great  You know  Because it's quality  And now you know  The network can  Either follow that  The same quality  Or continue  Or you know  The relationship with me  Can just  Can go on  And can go higher  Is that what  Is that what made you  Go to BET  Because you could have  Probably went anywhere  You wanted to  And that was what made you  I swear to you  That's the reason why  Because if I go  And this just smashes 
[03:18:30]  I'm solely responsible  For giving BET  A great quality TV show  And people now  Have to look at it  And respect the network  And the network in return  Will want to continue  The relationship with me  And will move on  And do other things  And other shows  And I can produce shows  And just bring  That's a smart gamble  I mean you know  You're going to go in  And it's like  If this goes well  I'm going to be able  To do whatever I want here  Yep  That's honestly  My reason for doing it  I think Kevin's doing  Pretty well  Yeah Kevin's doing  Really well  I think Kevin Hart's  Doing real well  Yeah and I'm happy  Oh by the way  Friday Saturday  I'll be at Poconuts

[03:22:30]  Kevin Hart was in for about 45-50 minutes  On Opie and Anthony  He's hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend  And I was telling Opie and E-Rock in the break  He's just a funny fucking guy  And that's the exact same  He's been much more successful now  And he makes a lot more money  But that's the exact same conversation  You would have had with him 12 years ago  Nothing has changed about that guy tonally  Like he's the same guy he was back then  That was the same funny cadence he had 
[03:23:00]  And the same way he shit-talked  Exactly the same  With the exception of the fact that he  Probably makes $400,000 a night  You know  That didn't change him though  That didn't change him at all  It's amazing  How that would have changed me  Like I'm a bigger dick now  Than I've probably ever been  But if I made that kind of money  I'd be intolerable  Intolerably awful  Not that you the listeners  Wouldn't adore me  Of course  I call it worship  Alright  Who's the first person 
[03:23:30]  To call up  E-Rock please  Talk into the mic  There we go  There you go  We're gonna talk to James  He's having a problem  With his mother-in-law  Oh no  James  Send her someplace  She's never been  The kitchen  Okay sorry  1950s  Go ahead James  Hey Jimmy  How you doing  Well buddy  Thank you  Hey  My mother sold her house  Like too quick  About three years ago  And she didn't have time  To find a new one  So  Being the nice son-in-law 
[03:24:00]  I am  I took her in  And  Now I can't seem  To get rid of her  She's  She retired from  You know  Two great jobs  So she got two pensions  She got all that money  From the house  And it was paid off  So she's loaded  And  I just  She won't leave  How does your wife  Feel about it?  Um  She doesn't want to  Upset her because  You know  She doesn't want it  To ruin their relationship  Yeah  Um  But  I just feel 
[03:24:30]  It's her  Responsibility  To kind of handle it  You know  Because it's her mom  Yeah it's a rough one  And you don't want to  Push it and start a big war  But it's your house dude  You gotta  How long has she been there?  Two years?  Almost three now  What you ought to do is  Just sit in the living room  And just jerk off  In the afternoon  Like watch TV  And just like  Not even with a hard-on  Just lollygag around your dick  And make her sit in the other chair  And kind of  Avoid eye contact  And watch TV  Or fuck your wife  Really loud  Like just be really degrading  Come on 
[03:25:00]  Move it  Cunt  Just yell really dirty things  In bed that the mother  Has to hear  And she'll move out  Either that  Or you and your wife  Should just move  And then don't tell her  And she'll just  Wake up one day alone  Like furniture in her bedroom  And everyone's gone  Right  I don't know what to tell you buddy  Talk to your wife  And tell her  Look  Your mother's a nice person  But you know  I didn't fucking sign on  To marry you and your mom  Tell her nicer than that  But  Yeah you gotta speak up  You could do it nicely  And say look  You know  We wanna have our own life  Yeah that's what I'm afraid of 
[03:25:30]  That  That it'll  It'll hurt her feelings  Because she doesn't have  Much family  I mean  We're basically  The only  Only people she's got  Wow  And  Why do you hate  Having her there  It's just  I want my own house back  You know  She  She smokes  I don't like that  Oh yuck  Well  Not in the house  But  Little things bother me  And I'm starting to resent her  And that sucks  You know  Even my kids resent her  Because she's there so much  You know  And she shouldn't have that 
[03:26:00]  Kind of relationship  With the kids  No her  I love seeing her  Everyone  Wants her out  But your wife  You and the kids  So  There's a way to say it  To your wife  But say hey look  The kids and I  You know  Come on  We want our place back  And you can have a nice talk  With her  And figure out a way  To do it nicely  So it's not like  You know  You know  It's not hateful  But I think you have the right  To want your own place  Dude so  Oh absolutely  You know  Just sit down  And go look  We've all talked it over 
[03:26:30]  And you're a cancer  In this home  And we'd like you  And your ciggy breath  Salif  Good luck buddy  Alright  Thank you  Alright  Yes  Alright  Let's talk to  Jared  He has a question  About your workout  Oh good  This will be a long answer  Jared  Hey what's up  Jimmy  Hey man  Dude that was a funny plug  During Kevin Hart  At the end of that man  Oh thank you  I don't shit my pants  Dude that was funny shit  Oh I got a quick comment  After my question 
[03:27:00]  About you  I saw you down in Atlantic City  During the show  A couple weeks ago  Thank you  Um you know  And obviously  You stopped eating  So like seriously  Like why don't  You're traveling all the time  How do you eat properly  And lose your fucking chin  It's very hard  To eat properly  On the road  You know I wonder  You wonder why  There's so many  Fucking fat fuck Americans  Like when you're in airports  It's all McDonald's  Like there's  There's nothing  Healthy  Um I believe in choice  Like Bloomberg's a douche  For making people 
[03:27:30]  Not get something  But like half the time  It's really hard  To eat well  Like it's  It's very hard  When you're on the road  To eat well  Um but I just go  What do you do  Like like daily  Like what's your  What's your thing  I go to the gym  Most days  Like I do abs  Every other day  There's an ab thing  I picked up offline  Where it's 10 different exercises  And I'll do 25 reps  Of each one  And then I do  Four sets of that  So it comes to like  A thousand exercises  It takes about 40 minutes  Um and it's hard  But it's not as bad 
[03:28:00]  As you think  And um I do that  And then maybe  A little bit of cardio  Or maybe just a little bit  Of back on ab day  Yeah  And I you know  Whatever  I just do chest, arms  Legs, cardio  The other day  I just try to mix it up a bit  And uh  I just eat better  I eat smart  That's it  I mean there's no  There's no  Magical mystery thing  To what I'm doing  I'm just eating better  Avoiding bread and pretzels  Which I used to love  Right  And that's it  It's really  I try not to eat late at night  And once in a while  I fuck up  Once in a while  I fuck up  So I think  Because I'm in the gym so much 
[03:28:30]  I'm able to fuck up  Once in a while  Like at Tom Papa's  The other night  I ate like a little fucking  A little blubber monkey  I just fucking was  Shoving pretzels  And treats into my face  A couple of brownies  But I think once in a while  If you do that  And then the next day  You don't spiral into it  You'll be fine  Hey also  Hey can I make a comment  And ask you a question  About that show down at AC  Sure  Well listen man  I thought it was really cool  That after the show  You guys did that Q&A thing  Oh good  And you know  I couldn't  I knew I wanted to ask you something 
[03:29:00]  It took a couple of weeks  To come up with it  But you know  I used to listen  To you guys all the time  And then somehow  I lost  I lost you guys  And then I went over to Howard  And now I'm back  Listening to you guys  And first  Just as a comment  Listening to you guys  Every day  It literally like  Makes me funnier  Throughout the day  Just sharper  Kind of wittier  Kind of thing  Oh thank you  Where Howard  You know  It's just kind of funny  Listening to shit  Or whatever  But  First of all  Do O&A  Do they still hate Howard? 
[03:29:30]  Because I never hear them  Talk about him  Nah  In all honesty  Dude no  There's  I mean  I've met him a few times  In the hallway  And we always stop  And say hello  He's been very friendly  When I've met him  And no I don't  They don't hate Howard at all  I mean  There's been that  Behind the scenes stuff  That's gone on  And there's been frustrations  But no  They don't hate Howard  So then  Would you do  Howard's show  And would Artie do  O&A's show  Or is that a kind of thing  That is like a no no  Well Artie's not on 
[03:30:00]  Howard anymore  Artie's able to do  What he wants  I think Artie's gonna do  I think Artie would do  Howard first  Because he hasn't been on  Howard since 2009  So I think Artie wants to do  Howard on his book tour  And would I do Howard  Yeah sure  But I don't  They'll never ask me  To do Howard  I've never  It's not like they've asked me  And I've turned it  I don't know  You're like a top  Fucking comedian  And you know  You would be great  On that show  Is it because of  Just the history  Well I'm also associated  With people he doesn't like  I mean  I'm close with Leno  And Howard and Leno 
[03:30:30]  Don't get along  And I'm on Opie and Anthony  And the shows  Historically have had  Strife  So I don't expect  To call  Anytime soon  And when I do it  Sure  What about Artie  On ONA  If Artie wants to come  On ONA  He's welcome too  We'll see what's happening  With this book tour  I don't know what to tell you  I would love to have him on  You are  You are kick ass man  Thanks  Thanks for the call buddy  Take care  Appreciate it  Later  Sure  Alright let's go to a girl  Oh my god  Dawn has a question for you 
[03:31:00]  Oh  About her child  My brother's an alcoholic  Oh sorry wrong Dawn  Hello Dawn  Hi Jim  Hi  How are you  I'm good how are you  Well I'm not so good  And this is why I'm calling  My son's father  Is a complete and total douchebag  Can I say that word  Yeah we prefer it  Yes  Oh okay  He hasn't paid child support  In ten years  He hides all his money  He's rich  He's actually at the point  Where my son is very depressed 
[03:31:30]  Because of this  How old's your son  Nineteen  Oh he's an adult  Okay  Well you have to pay  In New York up until  He's twenty one  Okay  And my son is very  Depressed over this  And I'm thinking  About hurting the guy  Well you know  You can't do that  Especially as your son  Has gotten older  It's I'm sure  I don't have kids  But people say  That when it comes  To seeing your kids  In pain  It's supposed to be  Very awful  What you might want  To do  Is  Again I suggest 
[03:32:00]  Therapy a lot  Just because therapy  Is a non-family  Non-twelve step place  To go  Where people can  Talk about their problems  To somebody who actually  Is fairly knowledgeable  So why don't you try that  Because as an adult  He's going to have to  Navigate that anyway  So let him go into therapy  And see if  How  If he can deal with it  Or does he want to  Reach out to the father  Or maybe he won't want to  He's actually working  With his father  Right now  Oh okay  But his father  Is just not 
[03:32:30]  Paying him right  And  Won't help him out  Whatsoever  Well then maybe  He needs to eventually  Detach from the father  And realize that  Just because a guy  You know  Made cum that made you  Doesn't make him a good guy  You know  Maybe just because  He's the father  Your son made the effort  And maybe the dad  Is just not that good a guy  Or maybe the dad  Hates you  And still associates  The son with you  You got it  You pinned it  You pinned it  Yeah  How do we stop that  I don't know  Maybe you should 
[03:33:00]  Have you considered  Calling the father  And saying  Look I know you hate me  But you're picking it out  On him  Oh okay  Well then maybe  Your son could say it to him  As an adult  The father shouldn't  Be doing that anyway  He shouldn't be  Putting the son there  Because he sees  Your face in the kid  But maybe your son  Could say  Look  I feel like you're  Taking your anger  On mom out on me  That's excellent advice Jim  Alright good luck  I hope it works out  Thank you  Bye bye  Ray has a question 
[03:33:30]  About stand up for you  Okay Ray  Ray  Hi buddy  Hey Jim  How you doing man  Good thank you  Hey um  So I've been wanting  To do stand up  I've been writing jokes  You know I got my whole  Forget it  You'll never make it  Next call  No I'm kidding  Go ahead  I'm kidding  You know I got my  Notepad full of stuff  But I just don't  I find it hard  To find the balls  To stand up  And actually  Just you know  Take a leap of faith  And actually do it  You know it's like  And I've done the whole  You know trying it out 
[03:34:00]  And like  Trying out like the whole  Routine and I feel like  I don't  I haven't found my voice yet  Have you been on stage yet?  No I haven't  Well then you have not  Tried it out  You have not tried it out  Um  I understand what you're  Going through  It's  Doing stand up  And maybe it's the same  For actors and singers  I don't know  But we see ourselves  As something  Like being a comedian  I always saw myself  As a comedian  Even when I was a kid  I saw myself as  I will be a comedian  It's an identifying thing  It's who you are 
[03:34:30]  So the scary thing  And I've talked about this before  Is going up on stage  And trying it  And realizing  That that dream  Is now dead  It's almost like  We're afraid of losing  This very identifiable feature  Like I was afraid  When I tried comedy  That it wouldn't work  And that I would have to realize  That I was just Jimmy Norton  And I wasn't special  Or that I wasn't this  This thing that I always looked to  Like this special day  Was never going to come 
[03:35:00]  You have to get over  Being afraid of that  And chance it  Because the day  Where it's all okay  And you're not scared  And you have it all figured out  Never comes  And there's guys  Who are very old  Who have dreamed for very long  And who haven't tried it  You should go up on stage  At an open mic  Realize that being afraid  Is normal  Bombing is okay  If people didn't bomb  There'd be two million comics  It's getting through  The scary process  That separates people 
[03:35:30]  Who are comedians  To funny people  Who aren't comedians  There's plenty of funny people  Who aren't stand-ups  Because they're afraid  So you do  Is you keep writing  Your stuff down  Tape record yourself  When you're on stage  And I would say  Do 10 or 12  Different open mics  And then get a sense  Of whether or not  This is something you enjoy  Or think you might be good at  But you have not tried it  Until you've stood up  In front of an audience  Alright, hey  Thank you very much, man  And hopefully one day  I'll share the stage  With you or something  You're welcome  And don't talk yourself 
[03:36:00]  Out of it  Don't allow being afraid  To convince you  Not to do it  You're supposed to be afraid  You'd be an idiot  If you weren't  It's okay  Alright, thanks a lot, Jimmy  Okay, man  Bye  Alan in Ohio  Has a question  About your special  That you taped in Cleveland  Oh, yeah  Okay  Alan  Yeah, hey  Hi, Alan  How you doing?  Good, buddy  I was at the early show  In Cleveland  That you taped  Yes  It's fucking hysterical  Thank you  I'm just wondering  When it's coming out  On DVD 
[03:36:30]  To actually buy it  Like a hard copy  Like are you going to be  Selling through your website  Or how's that going to work?  I don't know  The deal was cut through  Comedy Central Records  By the production company  So I don't know  It's going to air on  Comedy Central first  You know, by the time  This one airs  I'm taping another one  So I don't know  Hopefully soon  The deal has been made  Hopefully within a couple of months  It'll be out  You know  I gave way too much control  That special up  This next one  That will not happen with  I'll have complete control  Of it 
[03:37:00]  So hopefully soon  But the CD DVD will be out  Great  I can't wait for it  Thank you very much  Thank you, man  Thanks for enjoying it  You're welcome  We're going to stay in Ohio  Rick has a question  About his son's girlfriend  Okay  Hello, Rick  Yeah, hi  Hey, how's it going?  Good, good, good  All right  I'm going to try  And make this as quick as possible  I know you don't have  A half an hour  To sit here and be at  So  And I got an 18-year-old stepson  I know that's tricky 
[03:37:30]  As it is right there  Yeah  His father's never really  Been around a lot  And it's even been  To the point  His father's even claimed  That that isn't his real son  Okay  So  I invested a lot of time  And effort  You know  Into this kid  Because I know he was  Suffering as it was  You know  So  What age was he  When you kind of  Came into the picture?  Four  Okay  So yeah  I've been around  For a long time  Sure  But he ends up 
[03:38:00]  Meeting this girl  And  He falls head over heels  In love with her  And gets engaged  She even moves  Into our house  For a while  And  She's  Well  She's a Jehovah Witness  Okay  He's an atheist  Alright  But  The problem is  Is she  Is getting  Into his head  Really easily  And  It came  It got to the point 
[03:38:30]  In our house  Where  She was turning him  Against us  The whole nine yards  It was really ugly  It got really ugly  Everybody in my house  Was uncomfortable  Except for them too  So  I ended up  I did have to put my foot down  And  I had to make her go  Okay  We had this long discussion  With him  Of how  You know  It's not going to be right  And  You know  He kind of  He kind of saw the light  But  Now I find out  He's back to talking to her 
[03:39:00]  And  I don't know how it's going to turn out  And I don't know what I can do  Well let me say  First of all  He's 18  So there's really  Nothing you can do  Um  And I'm not saying  Jehovah's Witnesses  Aren't annoying  But  From what I hear about teenagers  They're kind of rebellious  Dickheads  A lot of times  And they buck this system  And they buck their parents  And a lot of times  They do it through drugs  Or a lot of times  They do it through saying  Fuck God  Your son maybe  Is doing it by going  Hey  God is okay 
[03:39:30]  Or whatever  Maybe that's his rebellion  You know what I mean  Or maybe he just genuinely  Yeah  Like this girl  And she's influencing him  But does she do drugs  Or does she drink  Probably not  No  So maybe she's irritating  But there's probably  A lot worse stories  You could be telling right now  Than my son  Is hooking up  With an annoying  Jehovah's Witness  Like  He's not dating  A heroin addict  Who he's gotten pregnant  Um  He's not out stealing  To support a habit  You know what I mean  So  Yeah  Yeah  It probably could be 
[03:40:00]  A lot worse  And hopefully  He'll grow out of it  But  You can't control it  If he's gonna  Wants to talk to this girl  She's you know  She's just an annoying  Religious girl  But you know  There's a lot worse  Case scenarios than that  I think  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You're certainly right  Yeah  It just scares us  That you know  If he does leave with her  He's gonna be gone  Just  You know  It just  You know  I don't know  Maybe he can  Maybe I'm underestimating him  I hope I am 
[03:40:30]  How long has he been with her?  Only a year  You don't forget the newness  Of a relationship  When you're 18  You know how obsessive we are  And the newness of that sex  If they're having sex  Or  You know  She's his link out of the home  Like she's this adult thing  He'll probably get sick of it too  You know  This is all new to him  Nobody who's an atheist  All of a sudden says  Wow  I wanna knock on everyone's door  And fucking  Give them pamphlets  That's fucking  Douchey  So just  Give him some time  He'll probably grow out of it  Or wind up getting too annoyed at her  Okay cool 
[03:41:00]  Good luck  Alright thanks  Excuse me  Yes  Let's go to Dave in Colorado  His wife gave him the green light  To sleep with other women  Ah yes  Lucky Dave  How's it going Jim?  Hi buddy  So  Kind of in a nutshell  My wife got sick  About four years ago  With severe anemia  They can't fix it  So  You know  Sex life hasn't been very good  Used to be pretty good  She's given me threesomes  In the past 
[03:41:30]  With other chicks  Okay  It's just always been  The turn on for her  To see me fuck another chick  But you know  It's a really weird situation  Now that she's gotten sick  I've felt  More of a sense of loyalty  To her  That I don't want to abandon her  I don't want to leave her  I want to take care of her  Right  But she's like  I know I'm not  She's a very sensible woman  She's like  I know I'm not  Providing my services  To you as your wife  And as a woman  She goes  You need to go fuck another chick  Go fuck another chick  Just don't ever put her  Before me or the kids  Just have that on your side 
[03:42:00]  But I  Are you calling  Are you calling to brag  That sounds like a great deal  I'm not dude  Because here's the fucking  Like moral conundrum about it  It's like  Yeah  Physically I have the desire to  But like emotionally  And spiritually  And mentally  I still feel like  I'd be betraying her  And that would be like  The worst dick move  That I could do  But I need it  I need to fuck some  Fresh fucking pussy  But how  Would you suggest  Just getting past that 
[03:42:30]  Mental block  Of detaching myself  Emotionally  Why can't you  Since you've had  Threesomes with her before  Why can't you  Somehow include her  In this  Even if  She's not involved  In the sex  Can't she be in the room  Or can't she just  Masturbate and watch it  Or is she too sick  To even do that  She's  She's  You know  She's kind of  Let herself go  A little bit  I mean not horribly  She's not a fucking  Slob or anything  Right right right  You know  She just doesn't 
[03:43:00]  Feel sexy  And I mean  And I try my best  To make her feel sexy  I go get her  Pedicures  And manicures  You know  But she's just like  She's not even  Interested in sex  She's not interested  Well she's giving you  The green light  And you think  It's a sincere  Green light  I already know  What it is  Fuck yeah  Why don't you  Tell her  What you just  Told me  I'm sorry  To interrupt you  Why don't you  Tell her  What you just  Told me  Like you look  I really want  To fuck somebody  Because I'm  Dying here  And then  Put her hands  On your balls  And go  These puppies  Need draining  But then  Why don't you  Say 
[03:43:30]  But I feel  Like I'm  Going to be  Disloyal to you  And I don't  Want to be  Disloyal  And then  See what she  Says  I'll do  I have told her  That  And she said  You're a fucking  Pussy  Oh alright  Well  She thinks  Like a dude  I'm telling you  Bro  I got a good  Situation  But  My question  To you  Is  Yes  Physically  I need to  Fuck another  Chick  And I want  To fuck another  Chick  How  Can I  Detach  Myself  Emotionally  Just to  Fucking  And enjoy 
[03:44:00]  Myself  And take it  For what it is  A physical  Activity  Well get blown  First  Why don't you  Start off  Just getting  Blown  That's a little  Less personal  A lot of times  Or just tell  Yourself  It's like  Anything else  I mean  When you're  Looking at it  Like that  Like you  Just want  To have  Sex  You know  It's like  Working out  Or it's like  Eating  Or it's like  Taking a shit  It's a physical  Thing you're  Doing  It's like  Dancing with  Another person  Except your  Dick is sliding  Into her  Just tell  Yourself  You're going  Dancing  But you're  Going to  Do it  In a motel  Eight  And then  Clean her  Back off  With a towel  When you're 
[03:44:30]  Finished  I'm done  With porn  Dude  I'm so sick  Of jacking  Off  Not even  Yeah  Get a blowjob  Or something  Or make sure  You wear a  Condom  So you don't  Get her  Knocked up  And have to  Deal with  That  But  I mean  Oh  I'm done  Oh okay  Well you don't  Want to come  Back with fucking  You know  The herp  Or something  Yeah  But I would  Just ease  Into it  Why don't you  Go out to  Eat with a  Girl  Or whatever  Or go to  A motel  And play  A little bit  And tell her  You'll see  How you feel  And then  If you want  To stop  In the middle  Of it  Stop in  The middle  Of it  Alright  Well thanks bro  I appreciate it 
[03:45:00]  Who's next  I like that  Opening line  You just called  A brag  I know  What a lucky  Guy  Matt in  Long Island  Has just  Found out  Something about  His sister  Oh  Hello Matt  Hey what's up  Jimmy  Hi buddy  So I just  Found out  That my little  Cousin  Is an escort  And like  Her whole life  She's been  In and out of  Rehab  She was doing  H  I think she's  On meth now 
[03:45:30]  I don't really  Know exactly  What she's doing  But I  Google searched  Her phone number  And I find out  Like 10 escort  Services with  Her picture  On it  And shit  And I don't  Really know  How to confront  Her about it  Because I know  If I confront  Her with it  She'll just  Completely cut off  All contact  With me  How old is she  She's 24  Alright well  If you want me  To confront her  With it  You can email  Me your contact  Info  And I'll be  Happy to talk  To her  Yeah I don't  Know  Would she really  Cut off all 
[03:46:00]  Contact with you  Well it's tough  Because she's  Kind of bipolar  She has like  All these mental  Problems  Obviously  That's why  She was doing  H and all  That other shit  But I've tried  To confront her  About drugs before  And she would  Just go off  Into a crack house  Somewhere and not  Talk to her  Family for six  Months  And I know  If I confront  Her about this  Now she'll  She'll probably  Just never talk  To me again  I don't know  She's walking  On thin fucking  Ice  Yeah you might 
[03:46:30]  Want to talk  To her  Sometimes it  Helps to talk  To somebody  And they know  You're not  Judging them  Yeah  Like when you  Come at somebody  And you go  I know what  You've been  Doing  You push them  Away  But if you  Come up to  Somebody and  You go like  Look  Between you and  I or however  You want to  Phrase it  I know you're  An adult  You have the  Right to do  What you want  But I just  Want you to know  I'm here for you  And I know  That you're doing  This but I love  You anyway  You know you  Might want to  Come at her  From that way  Because you  Can't stop her  From doing it  She's an adult  She doesn't  Have to talk  To you  She doesn't  Have to listen  To you  So sometimes 
[03:47:00]  Letting somebody  Know you're there  Is very very  Helpful  And then you  May be the one  Person in the  Family she  Feels free to  Talk to when  It gets bad  That's usually  The way it is  To like you  Me and her  Have a special  Connection that  Even like her  And her father  Don't have  Okay  You know  Because I've  Gone through  My own problems  In my life too  So you know  We can kind of  Connect on that  But this is  Kind of  I don't know  Like I saw  That yesterday  I'm like  Fuck  Tough  Yeah 
[03:47:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  I'm sorry  I just got a text  From Bob Kelly  And I was distracted  But no you're right  It is tough  But I would suggest  Letting her know  That you  Understand what  She's doing  And  That you know  You're there for her  And you hate to see  Her wrecking herself  And she'll go  I know I know  Mind your business  But she'll hear you  She'll know that  You're telling her  Something with love  Don't degenerate  Into an argument  I would just  Tell her  How you feel  And that you'll be 
[03:48:00]  There for her  When she's ready  And if she needs help  You want her to know  She can call you  And you're not  Going to judge her  Right right  I think she already  Knows that anyway  So maybe that's  Already one foot  At the door  Yeah but you might  Want to talk to her  I mean  Is it better to  Confront somebody  Or not confront somebody  On that  I would say  It's better to let  Let her know  That you know  What she's doing  Yeah but you know  Not be a dick about it  Just kind of  Yeah  Yeah alright  Tim in New York 
[03:48:30]  Wants to talk to you  About the Comedy Cellar  Okay cool  Tim  Hey what's up Jim  I just wanted to know  Your opinion of the classes  At the Comedy Cellar  And if they're worth the money  Well I don't  I've never taken  A comedy class  I know a comedian  Buddy of mine  Named Rick Crome  Teaches comedy class  At the Cellar  And I you know  For a long time  I was like well  Comedy classes  Are no good  But you know what  It's if he's  If you're going in there  And he's kind of  Helping you get over  A little bit of stage fright  And he's kind of 
[03:49:00]  Teaching you  It might be very helpful  Because I like Rick a lot  And I have faith in Rick  I think that he's been around  For comedy for so many years  And he hosted the Comedy Cellar  For many years  So he absolutely understands  That process very very well  Okay  So the worst that can happen  Is you don't learn anything  The best that can happen  Is you learn something really good  Like I don't think anything bad  Will happen to you if you go  Have you performed before?  No I've been doing like  Comedy mixtapes  Like rap mixtapes  Yeah  Performing in front of 
[03:49:30]  A live audience  This may get you  Sometimes comedy classes  Are good because  You're easing your way  Into it  And you're easing  Your way on stage  With a bunch of people  In the same boat  So like all of you guys  Will be novices  So you realize  Like you know  Hey this person  And I are kind of  In the same boat  So there might be  Some strength in numbers  When you actually perform  So yeah  I would suggest Rick's class  And again  The worst that can happen  Is it doesn't help you  But it's not going to hurt you  And can I ask you  How long did it take you  To find management 
[03:50:00]  And how did you find management  I never pursued management  I said they'll come to me  When it's ready  A couple years  I mean maybe five years  I was doing Jersey  With Bob Levy  And Florentine  And all those guys  Eric McMahon  And I finally came into New York  Five years in around 95  And I forget how I got it  I think a guy named Rick Dorfman  Who worked at Caroline's  At the time  Caroline's was my first  Management team  When the comedy club  Managed people  And then after that  It was Barry Katz  And Maureen Taron  And then from there  I went to MBST 
[03:50:30]  So they basically  Approached me  After seeing me  And I always kind of figured  That was the best way  To do it  All right  Well I respect that  Thanks a lot Jim  All right  Good luck man  All right  Let's go to  Lloyd in Vancouver  He has sex addiction  Okay  Hey Jamie  Thanks for taking my call  Hi Lloyd  Yeah  I have the  Voyeuristic sex addiction  That is something that  I've only recently  Come to understand  As an actual addiction  I just thought it was  Some sort of  Fucked up problem 
[03:51:00]  Now how have you been  Practicing it  Have you been doing it  Only online  Or have you been  Looking through windows  Or peeking through  What have you been doing  When I was like  18 or 19  I was looking through  Windows and shit  But then I kind of  Scaled it back  But recently I've  Kind of fucked shit up  Because I was  Peeping on my roommate  And I got caught  And I feel terrible  Because I didn't intend  For this sort of thing  To happen  But I'm just kind of  Like oh shit  Now what do I do  How do you get caught  I had a camera  Up to the  Bottom of the 
[03:51:30]  Of the  The bathroom window  While she was  Taking a bath  And I like  Recorded her  Essentially seeing it  And going like  What the  So  Yeah  So what did she say  To you  She hasn't said anything  So like  Maybe there's  Plausible deniability  When did this happen  Like two days ago  And she's  Interacted with you  Normally since then  No  I have not been  Around the house  Ah boy 
[03:52:00]  First of all  It's a crime  You gotta be really  Like I've looked  In windows  When I was a teenager  Which is  You know  That's sexual voyeurism  But this is  Really violating  And I understand  The temptation to do it  I'm not judging you  Because it's hard  Dude as a pervert  I know  What would drive  A person to do that  Yeah  But to the person  You're doing it to  And this is coming  From a fellow pervert  Like she has  A tremendous  Expectation of privacy  In the bathroom  And I know  That fury  To jerk off  To something 
[03:52:30]  To see something  The newness of it  The dirtiness of it  The taboo of it  But you really are  Violating her  Like  Sometimes it helps  To realize  That we don't  Do this stuff  It's not a harmless  Thing we're doing  In a vacuum  Like you're  You're really  Robbing something  From her  And that's  Humiliating  For somebody  And that's  Painful  And enraging  And to be  Spied on  It fucks you up  Man  Like you feel like  What if she  Picked her nose  Or what if she  Had these weird  Like you know  I mean it's such a  It's such an 
[03:53:00]  Exposing  Thing to do  Now how did she  Not grab the camera  Well  She was in the tub  Camera was like  Briefly visible  And then  Disappeared  When I realized  That I'd been found  Sort of thing  Right  Now do you live  In an apartment  Or a house  A house  What floor  Ground floor  Okay I'm asking  That because  Could it be someone  Else  Could it be you  Did she know  It was you  It's  I would assume  That it's like  90% chance  That it was me 
[03:53:30]  Like it could  Have potentially  Been someone else  But then  She could have  Talked to me  And gone  Did anyone else  Come to the bathroom  Sort of thing  Or whatever  But that didn't  Happen so  I figure she's  Either brushing it  Under the rug  Or is just  Kind of like  Reeling and doesn't  Know how to deal  With this  Well you better  Hope she's not  Calling the cops  Or doing something  Like that because  That is a crime  Dude  Do you have a lot  Of this stuff  On your computer  No  As I said  This is something  That I've seen  As a problem  I've actually been  In therapy  To deal with this 
[03:54:00]  And this was  Essentially like  A relapse  Of sorts  And I feel  Fucking terrible  About it  But I'm just like  Bullshit  What do I do now  Where do I go  Huh I don't know  I mean  You gotta go home  I mean you can't  Not go home  I would destroy  The tape  As much as  You know  I understand  Yeah  If she confronts  You on it  I mean I guess  You gotta be honest  And say look  And again  I'm not a lawyer  So I don't give  Legal advice  On shit like this  You know  If you wanna bounce  It off a lawyer  Friend please 
[03:54:30]  Yeah  But sometimes  The best thing  To do  When someone  Confronts you  On something  Like that  Is to just  Give them a  Mea culpa  And admit it  And say look  I've been in  Therapy for it  It was a relapse  And I violated you  And I'm sorry  Is that the only  Time you've done that  Or have you done it  Because she's gonna  Want to know  How many times  You've taped her  How much of her  Personal life  Has been fucking  Violated by you  Right  Because I'll be honest  As a sex addict  I don't believe  That you're taping her  For the first time  And you get caught  I don't believe  Anyone's luck  Is that bad  Come on  Alright 
[03:55:00]  Fair enough  Fair enough  Good call sir  The camera  Has been out before  But this is the first time  That actually anything  Would have been recorded  Because before  There was never like  A vantage point  Or anything  Ugh  What do you mean  There was no vantage point  Like um  I could only get  A picture of feet  Or something  Which would be great  If I was a foot fetishist  But no I'm not  So  It was a camera  Or a video camera  It was like a phone  Okay  Yeah  Um  Yeah she's gonna  Want to know  How much of her life 
[03:55:30]  Has been  How long have you  Lived with her  Mmm  Couple of months  And what's her  Did you move  Into her place  Or did she move  Into yours  She moved into mine  Now so she's probably  Totally creeped out  And scared  And she's probably  Scoured the apartment  For fucking cameras  Um  You know  That's very  Really violating  Yeah  The fact that you  Haven't been home  Is very  Very telling  But if she comes up  I don't know  Maybe uh  Ask a lawyer  What you should do  With the legal angle  On that  But I  Sometimes you just 
[03:56:00]  Gotta say  I'm really sorry  And I fucked up  And I don't blame you  If you wanna move out  Offer her the option  Of moving out  And uh  Let her break her lease  If she wants to  Yeah  If she wants to  Move out  And break the lease  And go somewhere else  Allow her to do that  Um  And refund her  You know what I mean  Give her that option  So she doesn't  Lose anything  That's kind of  What I was thinking  And then maybe  She'll be willing  Just to go  Look I gotta get  Out of here  Maybe she'll forgive  You and stay  I don't think so  But uh  You know  At least give her 
[03:56:30]  The option of leaving  With  By losing nothing  Yeah  Right  Right  Alright  Thanks Jimmy  Good luck man  And you should  Stop doing that  And that's a  A pervert  Telling you that  Cause it's not  Like it's illegal  But man it's  God damn  It's really  Fucking immoral  To violate  Someone like that  It also seems like  It'd be something  They would  Even if you  Weren't  Convicted  They would  Keep it on  Your record  For doing  Something like that  So that's gonna  Fuck with your  Job in the future  And everything  Yeah there's  Legal ramifications 
[03:57:00]  Sure  But it's more  The emotional  Baggage you're  Giving somebody  To do that  Cause she's gonna  Want to know  Like oh my god  I shit there  Was that  That privacy  It's like  It's a much  More mild  Form of rape  But it really  Is  A  A  A  Very subtle  Non-physical  Form of rape  To violate  Somebody like that  Man it's awful  And I'm not  Trying to make  You feel worse  Brother  But really  Look at that  For what it is  Rich on Long Island  Has a question  About your show  On March 29th  Oh in Boston 
[03:57:30]  Yes  The Somerville  Hi  Hey Jim  How's it going  Hi buddy  Hey and actually  I'm from Rhode Island  Common misconception  I have a question  I've been watching  Your shit  For years  And years  And years  On stage  I've never heard  You do your characters  Is that a reason why  Or is that something  That you want to break into  Sooner or later  Or what's up  In all honesty  I do them occasionally  On stage  I've wanted to incorporate  Them into a special  I did them on the  Please Be Offended  When I was touring  With that material  But I just didn't make  The final cut of the hour  A lot of times 
[03:58:00]  You know my sets are  An hour and ten  Hour and twelve  You have to cut twelve minutes  That's a lot of material  To cut  And you know  Eighteen minutes  Has to be cut  Or thirty minutes  By the time it's on  Comedy Central  With commercials  And there's no room for them  But I would like to do them  I do do them on stage  But a lot of my fans  Are not ONA fans  I'd say seventy percent are  But there might be thirty percent  That don't know Chip  Or don't know Edgar  Or Uncle Paul  But I should do them  But I would rather do them  In visual form  In a sketch show  Which I want to pitch  To a place to 
[03:58:30]  Where I really want to do  Chip and Uncle Paul  So they will see the light of day  I promise you  Considering like this promotion  That you just had  Was like almost a hundred percent  From ONA  And the show  Sold out within like five hours  Or so  At least for the one  I'm trying to go to  That's a good point  This is all an  Opie Anthony crowd  I mean I would love  To see a Ted  I would love to see a Chip  Yeah maybe I'll do them  I can't say I won't  And thank you very much  For the call brother  I do Chip a lot  On stage  I do them at the end though 
[03:59:00]  Because I don't like the whole  What happens is  If you do too much radio show stuff  There's so much  With the radio show  That you can get bogged down in it  And it's hard to get back  Into your material  And I'm going to stand up first  So I've never allowed that  Because sometimes like  You know  Artie will go on stage  And the fans love him  But they're like  You know  Nah Beetlejuice  Or whatever  They're yelling Howard stuff  So for him  It's like his crowd  Is a little rowdier  And I try to do that stuff  Towards the end of the set  But I do love doing Chip  At the end  But when you guys  Yell out Uncle Paul  Like I don't forget 
[03:59:30]  That I do Uncle Paul  I promise you  If I feel like doing him  I will do him  And sometimes towards  The end of the show  Like a lot of times  I do a big bit on oral sex  I mean I love oral sex  Everybody loves oral sex  And you know  I've been in these relationships  Right  I fucking have to  Beg the woman  To do it  I gotta point at my dick  Please  Pretty please  I'm like  Just kiss it  And then  She'll give it a kiss  And I'll go  Now kiss it quickly  And a lot  And she'll  And she'll kiss it a lot  And I'll just try to 
[04:00:00]  Jam it in her mouth  I find myself  Counting down  To these stupid  Special days  My birthday  My anniversary  Once or twice a year  For this special  Oral treat  I mean  Many of you guys  Are feeling this way  I mean  Don't waste another minute  You silly geese  Get mask sexual flavors  Today  Mask sexual flavors  They're flavored gel strips  We all know this  We use them  I mean apparently  They used to advertise here  I don't even know  If they do anymore  I'm just kind of  Shooting from the hip here  They dissolve on her tongue

[04:02:30]  Nothing  Hi buddy  Hey Jimmy  I've got a problem  I've got a 17 year old daughter  Goes to private school  And she's having a really tough time  Keeping friends  She had one friend  Just a little back story  She's kind of psychotic  But she left the school  Which I think  Kind of put that stigma  Well she runs with a crazy girl  And it's just heartbreaking  In the family  Because every night  You know  Come home crying  Wives crying  The whole  You know  How do you  Treat a 17 year old daughter 
[04:03:00]  Who's not getting friends  At school  When she still has  Another year of school  At the same private school  I just don't know  Well let me ask you  A couple questions  One is  You might have to wonder  Why is the one person  She connected with  A little nutty  And second of all  I mean  Detaching yourself as the dad  Look at your daughter  Just as a person  What is it about her  You think  That is  A  People are not  Kind of gravitating towards  Or what is she doing  To push them away  Just not as a father  Who says my daughter's the best  But just as a person 
[04:03:30]  What would make her  Unattractive as a friend  Or hard to be friends with  That's it Jimmy  She's just the nicest girl  In the world  She takes after her mom  Just for one of the good people  You know  And I don't understand  And I know the school  She started late  You know  Maybe seventh grade  I think it was  And all the other kids  Have started  Since their kindergarten  So these kids  Have grown up  In you know  The same bunch  And introduced somebody new  So she's kind of an outsider  For the last  You know  Four years or so  But as a person  Can't be beat 
[04:04:00]  Is she shy  Is she painfully shy  No not at all  Not at all  She's outgoing  She's willing to talk to people  Like the other day  I was asking  You know  What's still  Are you asking people  To go eat lunch  Yeah but nobody wants to  You know  I've asked  And asked  And I just don't know  It's just a thing  That's going through the family  Right now  We just don't know  What to do  Does she have bad breath  Or is it a bad hygiene  No no no  Hell no  Not at all  It's like  It's gotten to the point  Where she wants to  Leave that school  Go to public school  You know  Got a year and a half left 
[04:04:30]  Regular school  Before she graduates  Or even stopping school completely  Which I told her  That's the worst thing  What activities does she have  Because this is a skill  That we develop  Which we use later in life  So running to another school  There's an old expression  Wherever I went  Wherever I went there I was  The issue is with her  Even though it might be  A very cliquish place  There's something she's doing wrong  Or she might be too shy  Or she might be too  But you know  It's better to work it out  Because it's not  Like everybody is against her  I mean that's very rare  That that's actually the truth  Does she do any activities 
[04:05:00]  Or belong to any clubs  Oh yeah  She's on the yearbook club  She was on tennis  She was on the varsity  But she quit that  Because she overheard  Somebody saying  She's not good enough  For varsity  So she got back  Into her  I guess JV  But you know  Wait so she overheard  Somebody saying that  And got back into JV  So is your daughter  Too sensitive  Like some people  Are extremely sensitive  Why would she allow  Somebody else saying that  To push her back into JV  No it's not that 
[04:05:30]  She's overly sensitive  At all  Not at all  She's outspoken  Like me  She's you know  Not overly  You know  Vocal about things  But she doesn't keep  Her opinions to herself  You know as far as  But she's got cooth  You know what I'm saying  She doesn't just  Flat out  Just you know  Give the wrong word  You know she'll know  When to speak up  When not to  You know she's not  Overly aggressive with that  But as far as like  Her personality  I mean  Can't be beat  She does everything  She helps people out  All the time  And it's just a weird  Weird thing  We just don't know 
[04:06:00]  What to do  Is she one of those  Like a lot of times  I'll get into these  Like I can't get a girl  Rut  And do you think  That she's just  Again teenagers  Can sometimes  Overly dramatize things  We make things worse  Than they are  When we're teenagers  Is it possible  She's doing that  Because it's hard  To imagine somebody  Who's on the yearbook  Club or committee  And does these activities  And just has no  Friends at all  That's the whole dilemma  Is we don't know  What's going on  Because  You know  She's straight  She doesn't go out  You know 
[04:06:30]  On the weekend  She stays home  There's none  Of that stuff  I think a lot  Has to do with her  Boy  You know  No boyfriends  At all  And I think  That's a big part  You know  17 year old  Well  The school's got  To have a boyfriend  But she doesn't  Did you ask her  Guidance counselor  I don't know  If that helps  Or not  Or if that's  Old man advice  But is there  Something the  Guidance counselor  At the school  Might have noticed  If you said  Look she's having  Trouble making friends  And we don't know  Why she's a good kid  We brought that up  And we did it  Behind her back  So that she would  Be spontaneous  Not that her parents  Are doing it  But you know  Hey you know 
[04:07:00]  The school's noticing  So we talked to the  Principal and stuff like that  We just can't  There's no rhyme or reason  Why you know  This is going on  It's the weirdest thing  She's not mean  She's not  You know  She's a beautiful girl  You know  She's 5 foot 8  Green eyes  You know  She's gorgeous  It just  We don't know  What  I just don't know  How to handle it  Yeah I don't know  Buddy  I don't have very  Much experience in this  So I don't want to  I don't want to  Steer you wrong  It sounds like  You did the right thing 
[04:07:30]  But just realize  That there's probably  Something in the way  She's handling  Things as opposed  To who she is  Like she's obviously  Not a maniac  So maybe she's too shy  Or maybe she's  She's taking something  To heart  Because  There's no way  That like a charismatic  Outspoken  Beautiful  17 year old  Doesn't have any friends  Just on that  There's something  That you're not aware of  Whatever it is  Not that she's a bad person  But there's some  Things she's doing  At school  Or some 
[04:08:00]  Trait she's displaying  That you're probably  Not aware of  That's kind of  Worth thinking  Like I said  That's just  We just didn't have  Any idea what to do  Not a clue  Just any outside  Other than  What our own opinions are  Anything would help  You know  All I could suggest  To you  From my total  Lack of knowledge  Is to tell her  That it does happen  Sometimes  And to not give up  On herself  And to not allow  Herself to fall  Into a place  Where she thinks  That this is the way  It's always going to be  Because it's not  A lot of people  Peak after high school 
[04:08:30]  And the worst  Thing you can do  I think is  Peak in high school  The worst thing  You can do  Is be the  Fucking king shit  Or the queen shit  In high school  Because then it's  All downhill  So maybe point out  To her  That this might be  A weird patch  But it will pass  And people who  Peak in high school  Suck  When they're 30  That she has a lot  Of amazing years  Ahead of her  And to just not  Give up on herself  Well that's kind of  The advice I've given her  To you  You know  I've even told her  As far as 
[04:09:00]  My wife and I  Graduate the same year  In 88  And you know  We're about the same age  As you  How many of our  High school friends  Do we still keep  In contact with  I've got one  That's it  And my wife  None  I mean like you  How many of your  High school friends  Do you keep up with  None  I still keep  I keep in touch  With a lot of people  Who aren't in high school  But none of them  Were my friends  When I was  Alright good luck  Ben we have to wrap up  I think we have to leave  We have to go  Now you're off  We have six minutes  No we don't  We're done  What do you mean  We're done  We have two breaks  To do  Oh two breaks  I have people to help  Lives to save
