<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a "F.U. Friday" segment centered on Rudy Giuliani's withdrawal from the New York Senate race, leaving the path clear for Hillary Clinton.  The hosts express their disappointment, using highly offensive and derogatory language to describe Clinton and mocking her public appearances.  They speculate about Giuliani's future, envisioning a tabloid-worthy life filled with alcohol and women, and discuss Al D'Amato as a potential replacement opponent for Clinton.  A caller shares a surprisingly positive personal encounter with Clinton, describing her as unexpectedly attractive and smaller than her media portrayal.  The conversation shifts to the impact of a Clinton victory on labor unions, potential mayoral replacements for Giuliani, and the hosts' upcoming summer kickoff party.  The segment is punctuated by numerous listener calls, many including personal attacks and unrelated tangents, along with ongoing jokes about the chronic tardiness of Earl, a station employee.

The show then tackles the perceived unfairness of divorce laws, focusing on the financial settlements often awarded to women.  A caller, Rosemary, recounts her difficult experience after her husband left her and their three children, sparking a heated debate about women's entitlement in divorce.  The hosts discuss the Jim Palmer divorce case, highlighting what they perceive as a biased legal system.  Numerous callers share their own divorce stories, ranging from wives receiving substantial settlements to husbands losing everything.  Many callers detail instances of alleged financial exploitation and unreasonable demands by spouses.  A surprising guest, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley of the WWF, calls in. The conversation, initially about her role in the WWF, quickly turns sexually suggestive, with the hosts making inappropriate requests which she declines, revealing she was rubbing the phone on her arm instead of where they'd suggested.  The conversation briefly returns to WWF events before reverting back to the topic of unfair divorce laws.

The next segment blends professional wrestling discussions with a caller's divorce story and a major focus on Earlâ€™s continued lateness to his job distributing "Wow" stickers.  Earl's tardiness leads to a heated on-air argument, culminating in Earl hanging up the phone. The hosts speculate on Earl's undefined role within the station.  The conversation transitions to the summer kickoff party, detailing the location, date, confirmed guests (Otto and George, Jeff Norris), planned activities (wet t-shirt contest, Spaz's dunk tank), and a call for new on-air talent.  Listener calls continue, focusing on Earl's behavior and further tangents.  Spaz's "Week in Review" segment follows, featuring sarcastic commentary on various news items including Giuliani's cancer diagnosis and romantic life, Joey Buttafuco's post-Amy Fisher activities, and an ex-bishop's involvement with a sex website.  Earl's tardiness remains a recurring theme.  The segment ends with advertisements for Car Cash and a final reminder about the summer kickoff party.

The show concludes with Spaz's "Week in Review," characterized by rambling, often nonsensical commentary filled with obscene jokes and offensive language.  He discusses cancer (jokingly offering various types for sale), the Supreme Court's ruling on rape as a hate crime (which he attributes to frustrated homeless people), and the lack of representation of Mexican-American families on television. Callers react with a mix of anger, disgust, and bizarre commentary.  A caller attempting a Sam Kinison impression briefly appears.  The segment ends with a "What did we learn?" game, and a final promotion for an upcoming live broadcast from a Long Island beach club.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's F.U. Anthony, F.U. Anthony, 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W  It's F.U. Friday, F.U. Friday, F.U. Friday  It's F.U. Friday on the O.P. and Anthony show  And I have the first F.U. of the day  Yeah  A big, huge, tremendous F.U. to the mayor of this fine city 
[00:00:30]  Oh, dropping out of the Senate race  Well, he's got problems, Opie  If you haven't heard yet, he made it official  I think it was obvious to everyone that he was going to drop out  I don't know, seems to be taking a lot of people by surprise  Nah, you can just tell  They thought he'd tough it out  He made it official, he dropped out of the goddamn Senate race  Which pretty much means that Hillary Clinton will be representing our goddamn state  Oh, handed to her 
[00:01:00]  God damn it  Well, is he backing out because of the prostate?  Or because of his marital woes?  A combination of both, Anthony  Is it?  Because he'll blame it on the cancer  Saying, you know, the treatment's a pretty serious thing  And he's got a, you know, whatever  What's the word?  I'm just pissed  Because to tell you the truth  If he's backing out because of the marital stuff  Look at his opponent, Hillary  What, he went out, he was banging, uh  Banging an aide 
[00:01:30]  While he was married  Well  Sounds a little familiar, doesn't it, Hillary?  No, I think the cancer things, you know  Cancer is obviously a very serious thing  And he's probably freaking out right now  And he's got to take the treatment very seriously, you know  Yeah  But, oh, God  The Republicans, there's no way they're going to get a candidate  That's going to give Hillary a run for the, you know, for the money  Loud, lousy-o  They're saying lousy-o  But, I mean, she's got a huge head start now  A huge name behind her 
[00:02:00]  A huge head start  It's all over  Huge thighs  Huge thighs  She's a robot  She's not even human  Like, uh, our buddy, uh  Louis Black says  Yeah  Damn it, I'm pissed  I guess he's going to speak or something  So now everyone's going to say  Wow, you're, you're like a Rudy supporter  Well, I think he was  He was the better choice  Between the two  Plus the cops are happy 
[00:02:30]  Because, well, he was going to leave anyway  But, I mean, you know  He wouldn't be in the city anymore  No  Hillary  Hillary  Hillary  Her first friggin' political office  And it's got to be us  She couldn't go down to that goddamn ass backwards Arkansas  That she came out of  And, uh, run there  What?  Because she knows her own people wouldn't even want her  The rubes down there  Those eyes of her  Of hers must be bugging out of her head  Every picture they show of her 
[00:03:00]  She's got those eyes  Because usually  The frog eyes  She's got a big gaping mouth open picture  They always get her, uh  In that pose  There's never been a human picture of Hillary in the paper  Oh, I am distraught today  Distraught  Now we're going to have to  You know what sucks?  Now most of our campaign isn't going to be based against Rudy  So we're going to have to listen to her psychobabble about her issues  I didn't even care about what her issues are supposed to be  To help this state out  I was just hoping for some severe mudslinging 
[00:03:30]  You know  And with those two  It would have been great  It would have been a lot of fun  And that's another reason why I'm pissed off  Because the campaigning was going to be outrageous  It was going to be great  Now all we're going to get is months on end  Of Hillary in, uh, P.S. whatever  Kissing black kids  That's her campaign  I need another Negro child to hug and kiss  Please  What the hell is up with that?  I don't know  Are there any white schools around New York for the politicians to go to? 
[00:04:00]  Every time you see a politician at a school  It's, uh, it's a bunch of black kids  And, uh, Hillary reading to them or something  Or, uh, giving them a big hug  If Reverend Al ever runs, where does he go?  Like Glen Cove?  Yeah, right  He's not hugging the kids there  Someone's saying D'Amato should run  Oh, remember him?  He's been out of the mix for a while  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Hey  That's the only solution to this dilemma 
[00:04:30]  That's interesting  Got to bring back Alphonse  Anyone heard from him?  I don't know where he is  But this is his big comeback time  It is  If he wants to  I mean, this is it  He's shooing  Yeah, he got ousted last election  It was a close election  Yeah, it was very close  Absolutely  And this, I think, is a great move for him to get back into politics  If that's what he's going to go after  And nothing beats when he does the impressions of Asian people  I remember that  Oh, yeah  Oh, when he was doing the, what was that, during the OJ trial?  Yeah  He was doing Lance Edo 
[00:05:00]  He was doing Edo  Oh, me, I think  Oh, man, the crap hit the fan on that one  He would definitely be the Hillary Slayer, though  But that's who I want, representing our state  That would be good  Has a sense of humor  Exactly  Someone who's proven  That guy used to bring a lot of cash to this state  Oh, it's crazy  The guy, you know, he's in there  And he cares about the people  Where's Al?  Where's Al?  No offense to the Lazio camp  But I just don't see him making a run at it  You know what?  I read the guy's name in the paper  And I don't even know who he is 
[00:05:30]  Ah, he's been around  It's ridiculous  He has been around, but you're right  I mean, she's got a huge head start now  Huge  Yeah  So, bring back Al  Plus the fact, man  We're going to have the damn president in our backyard  Yeah, I know  Well  Like I said, that's probably the only upside  Yeah, because that'll be some stuff to goof on in the news, at least  See, and  Because once he's out of office  And he's just a civilian, Roman, New York  I'll have him, you know, taking pictures of him at the Kmart  And his sandals and shorts  How fun is that going to be?  Oh, God, it'll be great  I'm a privilege tonight 
[00:06:00]  Hey, Spaz, give me a lap dance  That's right  And thinks it's all, you know, well and good  But as soon as you start, you know, sitting in traffic  Because he wants to come into the city two or three times a week  Well, yeah  That's true  He still gets all the protection  You are going to be so freaking pissed  I don't think he'll come to the city, though  He's not a city guy  He just does that because he's the president  He is an Arkansas guy  He's going to be no shoes  He's going to be drinking Meisterbrow  On his couch  Big gut  Come here, baby 
[00:06:30]  And she's going to be taking care of the state  Oh, Rob  Jay, I've got to let you go  All right, send the K2  And hope he gets his teeth cleaned again  Oh, man  Yeah  How's your mouth holding up there, pal?  It hurts today  It hurts a lot  What was his name?  Shut up  Let's get all sides  You know I'm obligated to say that  I know  Let's get all sides of this issue on  I'm not happy  But, Rob, line one  This is the greatest day in New York  All right  Absolutely  For every working union man and woman 
[00:07:00]  This is the greatest day in years  You just wait and see what Hillary's going to do to you  Yeah  Let me put it to you this way, man  I met her Wednesday  She's going to screw you every way possible  You met her?  How big is that ass in real life?  I met her Wednesday, she  She is a completely different person than the media wants her to be portrayed as  Oh, really?  They're bashing the snot out of her because her husband's a dirtbag  Who cares?  What line of crap did she give you?  Actually, she didn't  It was more of a, hey, how are you?  And I was dumbfounded because I'm meeting the first lady  And I actually wanted to ask her a bunch of questions 
[00:07:30]  It probably would have got me shot by the Secret Service  Rob, how big is that ass in real life?  Yeah  It's not that big, man  Oh, shut up!  Stop it!  I've got to tell you  In all honesty  She's hot  350 people there  Yeah  Every one of them had the same exact remark  She does not look anywhere near big in person as she does in the media  Yeah, she's wearing one of those, like, pantsuit things where  No, come on!  What was she wearing?  They got ways to cover the fact  She was in a blouse and stuff  She was too big for me  It's not like they were, uh, there wasn't no secret mirror or anything 
[00:08:00]  I mean, she was right there  Alright, Rob  Should have tried to kiss her  No, yeah, that would have gone over real well  Wrestled to the ground  Hey, Rob  Actually, I was working with the Secret Service to identify people so that they'd let them in  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was pretty cool  What are you, a cop?  No, no, absolutely not  I'm a union rep  Oh, okay  Hey, Rob  And, uh, yeah  What I want you to do, if, uh, Ant and I are still doing New York radio a year from now  Yeah  You give us a call and tell us how great of a job, uh, Hillary is doing for you 
[00:08:30]  Let me tell you something  If she sits there and does nothing for three years  It's better than what this slimebag Giuliani would have done to the labor movement  His number one priority was New York right to work  And that is the destruction of unions  Alright, Rob  Thanks, guys  Thank you  Union debate going on for years  I don't think we're going to convert anybody on that one  F you to Rudy for dropping out  I mean, you know, people are all over the ball field on this issue  But, Eric, what's going on?  I mean  Man, I cannot take it  How could this happen?  We get another year and a half of him 
[00:09:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha  Yeah, he's still mayor  He's still mayor for a year and a half  Yeah  Well, who knows?  You know, he dropped out of this race  He might have to, uh  I don't think so  He might have to back out of being mayor  And who's he going to give the job to?  Well, who's the, uh, who's next in line?  Who's the assistant?  It's another guy with another colon cancer  Or whatever  Uh, prostate cancer  No?  No  That's the commissioner  That's the commissioner  He's got like, uh, a deputy mayor or something  Deputy mayor? 
[00:09:30]  I think it's Michael J. Fox  Michael J. Fox  That's the one  Well, actually, he's being replaced by Charlie Sheen  Yeah, so it's going to be Charlie Sheen  Charlie Sheen  Right  With all the hookers  All right, Eric  All right  Bye  I don't know, man  It was going to be an exciting race  A lot of mudsling, like you can't say  That's all I care about, you know  You know?  Now we're going to miss it all  Trust me, you know  I'm not the hugest fan of the mayor  But I just hate  Hate, with a passion  Hillary Clinton  Yeah  I think she's the biggest phony 
[00:10:00]  Hypocrite, phony  I mean, she  I see she has no right  Coming in here  Into New York  And saying that she knows what's best  For the people in New York  She didn't know what was best  In the White House  Right  Hubbies there  Getting hummers  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey  If Hillary gets in  You guys can kiss all your rights goodbye  Starting with the second  Amendment  And then it's going to work its way  Right to the first amendment  They're the ones that started  The politically correct nonsense  If you remember 
[00:10:30]  Yeah  That's all I have to say, guys  Have a good day  Thanks  We could argue this all day  I'm just, you know, whatever  To tell you the truth  I don't think much will change  I think  Where certain money goes  Is going to change  But  It's going to be the same amount of money  Instead of going to certain programs  That Rudy would have had to go to  It'll go to ones that Hillary wants to go to  But  Like I said  I'm going to miss the campaign  And I don't think she deserves  To be  In this state 
[00:11:00]  Start out at some crappy Arkansas state  Ugh  Are there more than one?  Hmm?  What?  Arkansas?  Let's see  Arkansas  Anything down there  Okay  Mississippi  One of those crap states  They're all considered the Arkansas states  Right?  Louisiana  Louisiana  That whole mess  That whole cesspool of America  On the Gulf  Right down there  Nick from Pelham  Get the wax figure of Rudy  I'll vote for that  It still has more personality  Than Hillary 
[00:11:30]  And it's wearing the wedding ring  So  Yeah  Yeah, whatever  I mean  There's obviously a lot of people  That support Hillary  I mean  There's a bunch of you guys  Checking in  I understand all that  It's just  I don't know  I was looking forward to a really wild campaign  Yeah  But like I said  Also the only good thing out of it  We got Clinton  Yeah  Yeah  And once he's out of office  I got  Please mark my words right now  Maybe  Mark this tape so we can play it  He  Once he gets out of office  Is going to be one of the biggest F-ups in history 
[00:12:00]  You are going to see this guy  When he doesn't have to answer to the public anymore  He's not a public servant anymore  There is going to be  A fanfare of F-ups  That he is going to get into  I believe he'll be the next Joey Buttafuoco  Yeah  I'll go that far  Very good  I'll go that far  Yeah  He'll have a little  A little beer belly  He'll have an auto shop somewhere  An auto body shop  Right  Yeah 
[00:12:30]  I can completely see that happening  When they move out to Bayshore on Long Island  Yeah  You know  He's going to have no one to answer to  You're right  Yeah  Once he has no one to answer to  It's out of control  The drinking  The broads  You're going to see  In the tabloids with him  It's not going to be like  Any other ex-president  You've ever seen  Because Lewis Black said it  Lewis Black was at one of these conventions  And he saw the president's stuff  And he said  Remember he was on the show  He said  Guys  You don't understand  The women  Are just like moist around the sky 
[00:13:00]  Throw themselves at him  They all want him  In a big  Bad way  And what would be the biggest thing  That would keep you  From getting a hummer  Maybe being the president  Having every move you make  Scrutinized like that  Maybe that would keep you from straying  Didn't stop him  Just wait until he doesn't have all that  To have to contend with  Ha!  Yeah just wait  He gets his wife in the senate  He doesn't have to worry about that  He doesn't have to worry about 
[00:13:30]  Screwing up her campaign  Because they probably have a deal  Look  You just sit and shut up  Finish out your term as president  Let me get elected to the senate  Then I don't care what you do  I'll make my own career  Right  You could go your own way  Whatever the hell you want  Yeah  Okay honey  Yeah  And then once it's over and done with  It's going to be such fun  Watching this guy self-destruct  Oh  I'll go as far as to say  That we'll get him on our show  I think so  I think Barry Williams is going to go  Oh man now he's out of control  With the broad  There was a day you know 
[00:14:00]  And I would have never thought  That we would have had  Barry Williams, Greg Brady on our show  Doing the things he was doing  Escort service  Yeah  William Jefferson Clinton  Could you send over a two  Three whores  When's Hillary coming there?  Four whores  Send over four whores  Super-sized  Can you get Anthony  The limo driver  To drive me around?  Yeah  Hey guys  I love coming on this show  Right

Because he shows up on  Everyone else's show  As well  He's already written off the show 
[00:26:30]  We haven't talked about him  He's done  I think we went with the  Chuck from Happy Days  Ending  Where he just disappears  Yeah  Alright  The fax line  To get your F.U.s in  That's the easiest way  212-957-9639  And we're doing a  Wow sticker stop  Once again today  Anthony  Yeah  Earl and the invisible man  They don't even put a time down anymore  Because they just know  He's going to be late  Did he leave yet for this one?

Why bother?  It takes a good hour to get up there  On a Friday especially  He's such a retard  I swear to God  What?  Mark didn't come running in the studio?

[00:30:00]  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes  Don't come here for the news  I don't like it when this show is dirty  Hey John, what's going on?  What's going on, buddy?  How are you?  Great, you're on the air, man  Yeah, I called and I kind of lied  The true thing was  You guys were talking about Sean Connery the other day?  Yesterday, yes  Yesterday  I called up and I'm kind of a new listener 
[00:30:30]  I work with one of my friends  And he listens to you all the time  And I called up with the Sean Connery bit  And I said  I wanted to get on the air  And take Spaz  Because I left Sean Connery  And he got a little upset  He called me a dick  What?  What?  You hear me?  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out  What the point is  There was no point  Spaz got mad at you  Because you did what?  I called up  And when you guys were talking about Sean Connery  How he beats his wife  Yeah 
[00:31:00]  He called  He said, you know what?  You're a real dick  And he hung up the phone  And he didn't provoke him or anything?  No, not at all  Oh, he must be on the rag  Yeah  He's awfully tired  He's only sleeping like an hour and a half a night  At this point  He's got to go to the strip clubs  All right  All right, John  We'll say something to him, all right?  All right, thanks, guys  Bye  Too bad he lied about what he wanted to talk about  That just makes the show suck  Let's go to Joey  Joey, you're next on WNEW  How are you?  Hey, what's happening? 
[00:31:30]  What's up?  Big FU to the Miami Heat tonight, guys  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?  I think Patrick's got to get that grimace face off  When he's running up the court  I think we've got to give him some stack of two tonight  I don't know  It's going to be a tough game  I think that whole airport incident was an omen for the Knicks  I think so, too  I think they've got to do something  They've got to shake it up  But it's going to be tough to go through the West Coast  But I heard Gary can't watch  Because the Emmy Awards is on tonight  Oh, yeah  Gary from upstairs  Gary's not watching that game 
[00:32:00]  No, he'll be watching the Emmys  Hey, just one question  Yeah  Is Spaz a fictitious character?  No, he's as real as it gets  That's a sin  It is sad  That's a sin  All right, Joey  All right, guys  Take it easy  Did you hear about Jeff Van Gundy's car and everything, Anthony?  Yeah, what happened with that?  Because we were getting preliminary reports yesterday  Well, it's a huge story now  It's all over the papers  Yesterday, everyone had their facts wrong  But what happened with the jetty? 
[00:32:30]  They turned on the engine again to what?  To make a turn or whatever they do, right?  Yeah  And the blast from the engine lifted up Jeff Van Gundy's 1995 Honda Civic  That's great  This is why I love Jeff Van Gundy  He drives a 1995 Honda Civic  Yeah  His players are all driving like brand new Mercedes and stuff  His car goes flying and lands on top of what?  Alan Houston's Mercedes?  Brand new Mercedes  Really? 
[00:33:00]  Landed on top of his Mercedes?  Yeah  It's very appropriate considering that Alan Houston let us down the other night  But it's just so funny on many levels  I mean, the coach is driving a damn Honda Civic  Not even a brand new one  Houston's driving the brand new Mercedes  And the jet blast flipped it over?  That's what they're saying  That's great  Yeah, up there in what?  Westchester?  The airport up there?  But that's why I love Jeff Van Gundy 
[00:33:30]  What, do they park their cars right next to the runway?  Well, have you ever been there?  It's a really tiny airport  It's funny though  He's driving a Honda Civic  Looks like he hasn't slept in days  Looks like his hair's falling out  That's why I love this guy  He just doesn't give a crap  About image or anything  He just wants to win  So what is it now against the heat?  What are they?  Heat's up what?  3-2  3-2?  Yeah  So it's a must win  Huh?  Yeah 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Well, go Knicks go tonight  I don't really feel good about this  But we'll be rooting on the boys tonight  Hopefully Ewing will come to play tonight  Big game, Ewing  Are you talking to him right now?  Yes  Big game  You got to have to play  You got to show your worth tonight  Everything's on the line  Let's see what you got, okay?  Let's see what you got  Well, maybe Van Gundy can drive his car onto the court  Threaten to roll it over on somebody 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, take out morning  Too bad it didn't take out morning at the airport  That's a good strategy  I know NIAC isn't in Westchester, by the way  Everyone's calling like crazy  You got pounded  Well, it's very close to Westchester  Hello  Tappan Zee Bridge is pretty much the cutoff  It's Rockland County  I understand that  Thank you  Abuse me  Blah, blah, blah  But we are doing that, wow, sticker stop  Up there at the powerhouse Honda of NIAC  Okay?  Great  Tony from Milford  Just one of the many emails coming in  NIAC is in Rockland County 
[00:35:00]  People in Westchester will have to cross the Tappan Zee Bridge  Which is an effing nightmare on Fridays  I guarantee Earl will not be there until 6.30 tonight  That is true  But Earl doesn't think of these things  He just casually leaves  He doesn't care  Powerhouse Honda of NIAC  Route 59 in NIAC  One mile from the Tappan Zee Bridge  Across from McDonald's  Earl will be there eventually  With the brand new  Wow stickers  Okay?  Yeah  Okay  As far as Earl's concerned  This is still like  New York's rock alternative 
[00:35:30]  N.E.W.  Scotso's still here  He's just  You know  Bringing him water  Or whatever he did  No extra effort  No  Don't have to get there on time  What did it matter in the old days?  Well, he's part of the old regime  They didn't have to work hard  They just had to just kind of  Just show up  Kind of lumber around the joint  And hope no one paid attention to him  Punch the clock  You ever have one of those jobs  Where you just punch the clock  And you're just looking at the clock  And come on  Two more minutes  Yeah  Come on  Let me punch you  Yeah, today's paycheck day  Yeah  I'll just take my paycheck 
[00:36:00]  I'll go home  Yeah  No one noticed  I didn't do anything  That's Earl  Well, it's a whole new regime  And people got to work hard around here  We're trying to make something  Of this damn place  Eric, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  How are you?  I was at a dance club last night  And  The guy's playing his music  And all of a sudden  In the middle of the music  I hear  Vagina  Penises  And he's playing all the sound clips  He's playing  Butt Sex  And he's got  Gay Marco 
[00:36:30]  Hey Hey  He's got everything  And it was cracking me up  He's doing O&A sound clips  Yeah  As he's mixing his tunes?  Yeah, all of them  What club?  Just about everything you got  You got the stupid  You're so stupid  And what club was it?  Facades  In Nanuet  I don't know any of those  It was funny though  I was having a good time  Cool  All right, Eric  All right  Thank you  Vacation whenever  Yeah, exactly  Here's Mark  He's backed up on the Tappan Z 
[00:37:00]  Mark  Yeah, I just got off the Tappan Z bridge, man  This place is so backed up  Black Earl  There's no way he's going to be here  He'll be handing out wow signs  On the Ron and Fez show  You're going to have to cut him loose too  What a douchebag, man  I've just about had it  I've had it with the laziness around here  No one cares  The guy should leave like four hours ahead of time  So he can be there on time for the fans  What is so important for Earl to do here  That he can't leave  Before we even get on the air  He should have left at two o'clock  Right 
[00:37:30]  What was he doing that was so important?  He would  His answer would be  Stuffing envelopes with wow stickers  That's all he does  Can we get like a monkey to do that or something?  If we didn't invent this wow promotion  He would have nothing to do  We're the reason why he still has a job  I'm working on the public file  You're working on crap  Every day you ask him something  Before he was able to stuff these envelopes  He was working on the public file  The hell is that? 
[00:38:00]  And how many years do you have to work on it?  So the Tappan Z is backed up, huh?  It's backed up  Especially coming  I don't know where he's coming from  Is he coming out of the city?  Is he coming out of New Jersey?  The city of course  Yep  It's really backed up that way  He's dead  Thank you Mark  No problem  Bye guys  Bye, let's go to Al  Al, you're next on WNEW  Hey guys  Hey  I just crossed the bridge  I left White Plains  In like quarter after two  White Plains is a minute  From the bridge 
[00:38:30]  And I just crossed the bridge, man  How long did it take you?  About an hour and a half  Well, I mean  It's just tall traffic  It's Friday night  Rush hour  All you city folk  Are coming up here to the country  It just ain't gonna happen, man  You might as well tell him  Cut through Jersey  And go to the Palisade  This is no bid anymore  I'm so freaking pissed off  You know?  I mean  Every day we give him a simple job  Just show up at this location  On time  And give out some wow stickers  I mean  Tell him to go to the Palisade 
[00:39:00]  He'll make it there a little quicker  Because there's no commercial traffic  And there's no bridge  But he has to go over to Washington Bridge  To get there  Right  You think he can handle  Going to Jersey?  Right  Thank you, Al  Hey, one more thing, guys  Yeah  The Spaz's parents own up to him or what?  Yeah  They're proud of their Spaz  Thank you  All right  Have a good one, guys  Bye  Earl Shipping  When it absolutely, positively  Has to be there late  Hey, Paul  What's going on?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Hey  Check it out  Listen, I'm stuck on the Top and Z  I'm bugging out right now 
[00:39:30]  There's traffic  I think there's an accident up the street  But not for nothing  I'll tell you what  If he gets up there anytime soon  God bless his soul  And Opie  Don't be stupid  Nyack's in Rockland  See you, precious  I already said that  I, you know  Yeah, close enough  Oh, my God  Psycho Mark in the studio  Oh, hi  Psycho Mark  He was an hour late last night  This is the fourth radio show  That Psycho Mark's been on today  No, as a matter of fact 
[00:40:00]  There's none  You were on Radio Chick's show today  Don't lie to me  I heard it  I was in freaking  In Pip  Like Pip's office  Did you get calves on me?  No, the listeners do  Oh  Look, I don't walk in and out of the studio  The listeners  Email like crazy  Saying you're like the biggest radio whore around here  You're on everybody's show  And you just lied to me  I heard you on the Radio Chick's show  When I was in Pip's office today  So, what do you have to say?  I was going to say  He was an hour late last night with Butch  What, a black girl? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah  Yeah, I heard Butch from the Radio Chick's show  He had to sleep here because Earl was so late  But the best part  When they were driving back  Earl slammed the brakes  And Butch fell out of the chair  And slammed his head in the van  Now Earl's on the line  Did someone beep me?  Earl  Yo  Where are you?  I'm headed towards the West Side Highway  Oh  Look now, he's all pissed  Earl  What were you doing before you took the van out today? 
[00:41:00]  Stuffing envelopes  Stuffing envelopes  Don't you think?  And I had some paperwork to take care of  I had to go over some things with Matt  What was the paperwork for?  Well, from last night's appearance  You had to do paperwork about...  You talked to him, man  Was what you were doing so important  That you couldn't have left  Maybe at two  Two  To get there on time?  I didn't know  Earl, what's your...  Fine 
[00:41:30]  How many stickers can you put in an envelope?  Fine  In an hour?  Two  I don't know  I don't count  I don't keep counting that  Well, whatever  Don't you think you could probably hand out more live  Than you could mailing?  Isn't it more constructive to maybe take an hour  And leave earlier?  I don't get it  What time are you supposed to be at powerhouse Honda of Nyack?  About 4.30  There's no real set time on it  But I believe 4.30  There's no set time  You know, 8, 9  Do you honestly think you're going to be there by 4.30?  There wasn't  I don't know, we'll see 
[00:42:00]  Well, there is a set time on these things  Are you taking the Tappan Z Bridge?  It's on the goddamn spot  I plan on it, yeah  Do you realize it's Friday?  It's backed up, yeah  Yeah  I realize that  Do you realize it could take you an hour  Just to get over the bridge?  Oh  Help me  Help me  Help me  Help me  Help me  Help me  These are things you've got to think about before you leave  Oh, Lordy, no  It's happening early today  It's what you're saying  It's the specific type of leaving early today 
[00:42:30]  Things happen  I'm sorry  How come things happen every single time?  Every day  It's not things happen today  It's things happen every day  Every time we go, well, Earl's on his way  And then someone comes in  No, he's still here  Every day  If it happened once  It wouldn't be like this  Every day  People are calling like crazy  They're all back  They're all in the traffic  The traffic is backed up before the bridge  Dave has a suggestion for you 
[00:43:00]  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, I just got a suggestion for Earl  What he should do is  Leave early  Take a couple of boxes of the envelopes  He's got the stickers in the van anyway  Get to the place  Go to a coffee shop  Or a parking lot or whatever  Stuff the envelopes there  And then go to the site  It's fine  Ah, there you go  That way you're there  But here's a better idea  Instead of driving in rush hour  Here's a better idea  How about having  Instead of having one guy do four jobs  We assign different people different tasks 
[00:43:30]  Well, Earl, four jobs  Give us three  Dude, you do four retard jobs  That equals one job  Jesus  Name your four jobs  Name the four jobs  You really want to get into this?  I've done every sticker stop except two  Two?  I run Don and Mike  I'm running Don and Mike all next week  You didn't run Don and Mike last night  And you don't run it every night  No, I did not  Yeah, we went up to the island to scout out a spot 
[00:44:00]  Alright, so you push a few buttons from 7 to 11  What else do you do?  Five  No, you said you do four jobs  I want to hear them  Time for an Earl hang up, I believe  Earl?  Earl, two more jobs to go  Yeah, we just cut out  Two more jobs to go  Two more jobs to go  You stuck?  Hello  You stuck?  We want to know the other two jobs  I'm sorry guys, I can't hear you 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, of course you can  Oh my God  You stuff envelopes and you push a few buttons  What else do you do?  That's two jobs  Which equals a half a job  What are the other two jobs, Earl?  Hello  We have a guy that does the garbage  So you can't claim to do that one  Earl  What's the other job?  What are the other jobs?  That's six  Anyway, Earl's going to be at Powerhouse Honda of Nyack 
[00:45:00]  Route 59 of Nyack  One mile from the Tappan Zee Bridge  Across from McDonald's  Giving out the WOW stickers when he decides to get there  Steve, checking in  Earl's jobs  One, hang pictures  Two, stuff envelopes  Three, get lost on the way to sticker stops  And four, just in quotation marks  Paperwork  He's always doing this mysterious paperwork  Someone ought to assess what he does  Of course 
[00:45:30]  Okay  Let's go to Nick  Nick  Nick  That was a big accident  Yeah  Do me a favor, tell my man  He ain't going to get there for a couple of years  Yeah  A couple of years  Yo, do me a favor  I want to say a big F you  Yeah  Let me tell me  Big F you to my dirty pig ex-girlfriend  I hope you die, you pig  Wow, what'd she do?  Yeah, what'd she do?  What'd she do to you, dude?  She did the wrong thing, man  She went behind my back 
[00:46:00]  She did the wrong thing  She was actually with a friend of mine  But, you know, too longs don't make a right  So I'm going to just bang a best friend tonight  So that's all I care about  All right, man  When in doubt  Get even  That's all I say  You're a dirty pig  Thanks, fellas  Thank you, Nick  Bye  All right  Ben's going to suggest a new route  For Black Earl  Ben, what's up?  What's up, man?  What route is he taking?  Is he on the West Side Highway  Going into Jersey 
[00:46:30]  Or is he going to go straight to the Tappan Z?  On the Tappan Z  Because he can go totally past through that  Go right through New Jersey  Either through the 9W  The Parkway  Or Route 17 North  He does  That would be a good idea  But Earl can't drive his way home  Earl doesn't know where he lives  How about the Invisible Man?  Help him out with the map  Yeah, not a bad idea  Thank you, Ben  All right, guys  Syndication where Earl's on time  To a sticker stop  That makes sense  Bye  All right, Anthony  Enough of that  It's just frustrating 
[00:47:00]  Day after day after day  It started out as a bit  But every day he's late  Yeah  And then you guys bitch and scream at us  Yeah, but waiting in the rain for an hour  For that guy  To give me a sticker  Where was he?

No you know something  Everything else just pales in comparison  To uh  The my court appearance the other day 
[00:51:30]  You know how that is  Well no you don't  No I don't  I hope you never would  Let me tell you something  I'm learning a lot from you Anthony  Oh  Learning uh  A hell of a lot from you  I  I just  I will not get married  Unless uh  There's a prenup  Uh involved  Not that  Very good  Good rule  We're making a lot of money  That's definitely not the  The case here  Good rule of thumb  Um  But there's just horror stories  All over the news  Uh  Yeah  Did you read about uh  Who was it  Jim Palmer  It was in the paper today 
[00:52:00]  Jim Palmer getting a divorce  Yeah  And uh  There was a chance  In the settlement  That he was going to lose  Some of his like  World Series rings  In a divorce settlement  You know  That's ridiculous  Give me the paper  Where did I read that  The post or the daily news  Give me uh  Give me the post  If you got the daily news  Cause I want to make sure  I got my facts straight here  Well while you're getting that  Uh  Donna Hanover  Giuliani's wife  Yeah  She just hired  One of those  You know  Powerhouse  Divorce lawyers  Uh huh  So you know 
[00:52:30]  That's going to be  An ugly one  Of course  Let me see  Go ahead  Keep talking  Keep talking  You might have it  In the daily news  Maybe it's in here  Are you kidding though  With the uh  World Series rings  Yes  Now why would she be  Entitled to that  Unbelievable  Did she teach him  How to throw a curveball  Yeah  Was she ever out  On the mound  She just supplied the mound  For when he wasn't  On the mound  I think that was the problem 
[00:53:00]  He was uh  He was involved  With other mounds  You know something  Give me that  Give me that paper  Cause I really want to  Get my facts straight  I know it's in the daily news  There has to be a drastic  Uh revamping  Of some of the laws  In this country  When it comes to divorce  And I would say this  Even if I wasn't uh  Engrossed in it  I mean  Believe me  Cause it's just ridiculous  There is no reason  That that woman  Should be entitled  To his World Series rings  I mean  You know  Fair is fair  I understand that  But uh 
[00:53:30]  It's like you just said  It's never a fair uh  It's getting out of hand  The ladies obviously  Make out in these  Divorce uh  Proceedings  You know what it  You know what it  Started as  You know  Back in the olden days  Opie  I'm listening  When uh  Women didn't work  They just took care  Of the house and stuff  And the guy would work  And bring home money  And then if he left  The woman would be  A destitute  You know  So they made these laws  That uh  The guy would have  To pay money  And I'm not even  Talking about child support  I'm just talking  Oh the woman 
[00:54:00]  Uh  They made these laws  Where he'd have  To pay the cash  Because she'd be  On the streets  She didn't work  She didn't have  Any skill  Uh  People didn't hire  Women back then  It's just the way  It was  Well the times  Have changed  And uh  The women's  Libs came  Libbers came out  And uh  Women have uh  All these rights  Now to work  To do whatever  They want  They've screamed  About this for years  And fine  Now you got it  But you know  What didn't change  The god damn laws  Because now  It's gotten even worse 
[00:54:30]  Now in a divorce  The woman's entitled  To things that  Is  Just absolutely  Ridiculous  Re-effin-diculous  But yeah  You sprinkle in  Some scumbag lawyers  Some of this  Some of that  And before you know it  The guy gets effed  Gets effed  It just makes guys  You know  Get the prenup  Before they get married  At this point  But you know  Most people don't think  About it  Because they go  Into a marriage  And like  Oh you know  Come on 
[00:55:00]  We're not going  To have problems  You know  But as soon as  The S hits the fan  Oh there you go  And the ladies  Get that lawyer  It's all over  Yeah  Blood sucking lawyers  Oh  You know  We got a million  Other members  Of the Opie and Anthony  Show  Could someone find  The Jim Palmer story  For me  It's driving me nuts  I don't remember  I read like  Four papers today  I don't remember  If it was in the  USA Today  Sports section  But you guys  Are members of this show  Help me out  Because it's driving me  Something  It's driving me crazy  God  But I'm almost positive 
[00:55:30]  That's what I read  That you know  He finally learned today  That he wouldn't have  To give up his  His wedding rings  World series rings  But she was trying  For him huh  Yeah she was trying  For him  It has nothing  To do anymore  With fair  It sure doesn't  I don't think  It ever did  Maybe they just  Try to you know  Rake you  Each side  And I'll tell you  Something  If it's the opposite  Way  And it's a woman  Who had her career  And trying to  Do something  With her life 
[00:56:00]  And the guy  Was trying  To get money  I'd feel  The same way  Because it's  Ridiculous  I don't know  How some of these  Women sleep  Sleep at night  Knowing they just  Like  Pulled one over  On their ex  Oh it's ridiculous  Alright  You can't find it huh  No it's pissing me off  We'll bump into it later  Somebody will find it  For me  Let's go to the  Post  Can you pull those over  Rose  Rosemary what's up  What's up  I'm getting infuriated  As I'm listening  To this 
[00:56:30]  Why is that  Because  My husband  Walked out on me  And my three kids  Alright  And I'm  Okay  I have young children  And I'm not working  That's different  And you're talking  About  How  Unfair  The laws are  And what the woman  Is entitled to  But what is the woman  Supposed to do  Before you get to court  By the time  You get to court  And someone  The woman actually says  You have to pay  X Y and Z  Per child  Plus support the lifestyle  She's accustomed to 
[00:57:00]  He's been  Screwing her  So by then  All of a sudden  You know why  Because all of a sudden  The lifestyle  She becomes accustomed to  Goes up about  250,000 times  Full F  And you know something  I can't relate to this  Because I don't have kids  Now for a kid thing  Yeah then the guy's  Got to kick in some bucks  For the kids regardless  I got three kids  And I'm home with my kids  Every single night  Which is where I want to be  By the way  Not that I'm looking  To run around  Well that's a totally 
[00:57:30]  Different situation  He walked out  And he's whining and dining  Wherever he wants to be  Okay  By the time I finally  Get this man in court  Not only do I want  The rings that he has acquired  While we were married  I'll take anything else  I can get  See  Maybe she's  Maybe she's in the same position  All revenge  This has nothing to do  With fair  Or even  Or anything like that  You just want to  Screw him now  No he's screwing us  Ah see  That's  Maybe he just  Why did he leave  She goes 
[00:58:00]  An S  You know why  Let me tell you why  You guys talk about  The strip clubs  Yeah  That's where he was  About a week ago  And never came home  The whole weekend  A grown man  With children  And he's out  Doing his own thing  Well he's a man  He's a  Okay  I'm not going to  You've got to watch  The S word  We already had to  Dump out of you twice  Yeah I mean  It is so not fair  No no  You know what  You know what  Fair would be  For him to  Adequately support  His children  And if you're not 
[00:58:30]  Working  Right  To I guess  Give you money  You need  Until you can get  On your feet  And work  What all of a sudden  You're not supposed  To support yourself  Who said that  I'm saying  Why is it  That the choice  Is his  That overnight  Literally  Overnight  I have to go out  And get a job  Right now  Literally  Because he has decided  It's called life  It's called life  Sometimes things  Don't go your way  What do you think  What do you think  You won lotto  Because you got married 
[00:59:00]  All of a sudden  Now you're not  Supposed to work  Am I talking to her  No I didn't say that  I am entitled  Yeah  I am entitled  Okay  For my life  To continue  And for my children  Not to be screwed up  Emotionally  When their father left  That's probably  Now mommy should leave  And go get a job  And how do kids  Professionalize it  In their minds  He should support  His children  Yeah we understand  That you're entitled  To something  But it gets to the point  Where you know  All you're thinking  About is revenge  And taking them 
[00:59:30]  For you know  Everything  That's ridiculous  No no no  I take them  For everything  But I  For life to be  As it is  As it has been  No it's not  Now he's gone  And you have to  Deal with  Certain hardships  And he has to  Support his kids  But what makes you  That's the reality  What makes you entitled  To things that  You probably  Shouldn't have anymore  Oh  I shouldn't have them 
[01:00:00]  Because he decided  I shouldn't have it  Yeah  Excuse me  If you're  If you are accustomed  To Louis Vuitton  Why overnight  Should you not have it  Oh what a bitch  You know why  Because it happened  It happened  There were no guarantees  When you got married  Did you sign something  That said  You're entitled  To this  Are you going  Through a divorce  Absolutely  You're not giving up  Louis Vuitton either  I don't have kids  I don't have kids though  You know 
[01:00:30]  A totally different situation  If you kept  If you kept  Your wife  In a mink  Coat  Louis Vuitton  In a certain lifestyle  Why should I  One day be wearing  French perfume  And then overnight  I'm going to be buying  CVS cologne  It's not going to happen  Because it's life  That's called life  What are you going to do  What would you do  If your husband died  And you weren't getting divorced  I got life insurance  Dude  Where are you going  Yeah this is why  I'm nervous  This is it  Guys  If you're going to get married  Listen to this 
[01:01:00]  Sandy  Sandy  I hope you're listening  This is the reason  Why we're not getting married  Anytime soon  You're a meal ticket  You're a giant  If you're a guy  Getting married right now  You're a meal ticket  You're a giant lotto  Scratch off ticket  Waiting to be cashed in  You got that right  Not about the lotto  But about them being scratch off  Oh please  Not scratch off  There's the other blank off  You should have spread him more often  Maybe he would have stuck around  Honey he got it as much as  As part of the settlement  Negotiated in Baltimore County Circuit Court 
[01:01:30]  The former Baltimore Orioles star  Jim Palmer  Will be able to keep  His three world championship rings  And his three Cy Young awards  Should that even be an issue  There was a doubt that  There was a doubt there  That he might lose this stuff  Anthony  In his divorce settlement  Unbelievable  Joan Palmer will be allowed  To keep possessions  That include the couple's condominium  In Juneau Beach, Florida  Their home in Baltimore County  Will be sold  Both Palmers have filed suit  Against each other  Is she going to have to be 
[01:02:00]  Inducted into the Hall of Fame  Is that part of the  So  Don't laugh  I wouldn't be surprised  If it was brought up  In the case  It's unbelievable  I had something to do  With his career  I want my name added  To the plaque  In Cooperstown  Christ  You know something  When kids are involved  It's a different story  Because then  It adds a whole thing  Of if she can work  Or can't work  Due to the kids 
[01:02:30]  And the husband  Of course  He has to support  His children  That he had  I'm talking  When you have  Just a marriage  Without kids  You know  Why all of a sudden  Did the rules work out  That the woman  Doesn't have to work  Doesn't have to do  Anything anymore  I don't know  Where that came from  Elon from Westfield, New Jersey  Chris Rock said it best  While at a steakhouse  I get accustomed  To having steak  That doesn't mean  They owe me a steak  When I leave  Also 
[01:03:00]  That's funny  And this is good too  Also  The guy grows  Accustomed to certain things  Too in a marriage  Ladies  Yeah  Like having your  What  You know  Taking care of  Three times a week  And all of a sudden  That dries up  What happens to the stuff  We're accustomed to  Because I guarantee  You go through  You're a guy  Going through a divorce  The women will come up  With stuff  That is amazing  That they need  Money for 
[01:03:30]  The stuff that  When you were living  In the same house  You never heard  Oh my god  Never  Never  And then all of a sudden  There's X amount of money  That this person  Needs  To get along  Like would be  On the street  If it was a buck less  And you want to laugh  But you're screaming inside  All of a sudden  This amount  Comes out of nowhere  It's like  What?  You freak out  And they just  Look at you  Like  What?  But that's what it is

[01:13:30]  Was because of  What the guy  Was doing  Working  But he went  To the bank  One day  And  There wasn't  A dime left  Oh  Friend of yours  Yeah  And then the husband  Ends up living  In a dumpy  One room  And the wife  Gets the house  And shares it  With the boyfriend  You know there's  Someone  Because they're not  Married  The husband  Still has to owe  Her money  Right  You know without  Giving out names  Yeah  And I swear  There's no one  In this studio  Right now  There is someone  That works for the station  That's exactly  What happened to him

[01:18:00]  Go ahead Maria  Good I'm really ticked off about it  Because women are getting a bad rap  Not all women are exactly like that  I don't want anything from any guy  I've been doing it by myself  For the past 14 years  Are you married  No I'm not married  Have you been  No I had a child  Say so you don't know  No I had a child with somebody  But you know  He's 14 years old  And his father's never given him anything  And I've never went to court  And asked him for anything  So if I ever do get married  I do want to sign a prenup  Because whatever I have  Comes with me  Whatever he comes into the marriage with  He leaves with  I don't want anything from anybody 
[01:18:30]  So not all women are after the money  I don't want anything from any man  I don't know maybe it's something with the gold  Or the diamond  Gets in the bloodstream  Or something  It screws up the brain  I think the lawyers have a lot to do with that  You say that now  But you get a lawyer  And he'll convince you  Into other things  Trust me  Women are always screaming poverty  Like that lady  The lifestyle she was accustomed to  Yeah  When her mother delivered her  She must have came out  In a silver platter  Because I have never been  I'm not accustomed to anything  You know life's a bitch  I'm not accustomed to anything 
[01:19:00]  Things change in life  You know  There are a lot of people  That aren't living lives  They're accustomed to  Because of  What  Maybe an accident  Maybe cutbacks  At the company they work for  Maybe the NASDAQ  Taking a dump  I mean there are a bunch of people  That aren't living  The lifestyle they're accustomed to  Why  If you get married  All of a sudden  The guy  Has to do whatever it is  In his power  And beyond  To keep her  In a living  That she's accustomed to 
[01:19:30]  And it's never the living  She's accustomed to  It's always  300% more  Than what she was accustomed to  They would just  Like you to believe  That that's it  I guess  If  When and if  I do get married  And then we divorce  The only life  I know  Is poverty  You know what I'm saying  I think not all women  Are like that  And a lot of women  Do get the short end of the deal  So  Alright thank you Maria  Thanks a lot guys  Okay  Bye  Alright well there's some  Great instant feedback 
[01:20:00]  Coming in  I guess  Rich from Jersey  Just want to thank Anthony  For sharing his insights  Into all of this  Because of it  I decided to call off  My wedding this fall  Good man  Very good  Bravo  Save yourself  An ulcer  Bill from Jersey  I've been married 15 years  And there are no problems  With our marriage  But when she gets home  From work tonight  I'm punching her  Right in the face  And I guess this guy 
[01:20:30]  Is a broker  A broker from the city  I'm sitting in my office  Right now listening  I thought you guys  Might like this quick story  I got married in 96  And I was worth  Close to 2 million dollars  A year  A year and a half in  And it was over  The marriage  One month before  The papers were drawn up  I made a huge business deal  Worth 5 million dollars  To me  She wound up  Getting half of that deal  Even though they were  Already separated  Right right  She got half that deal  Plus the $800,000 house  And is still  Looking for more 
[01:21:00]  For more  Never ever ever  Get married  They are all hookers  They just get paid  In different ways  Oh my god  That's the broker  From the city  Wow  Alright let's go to Ed  Ed  Hey  How are you  I'm doing alright  Good  Alright I'm a child  Of divorced  And just for sitting back  And watching what happened  With my parents  I can tell you  That my mom  Got completely screwed over  By my dad  Okay  I mean my  I know like  I know now  Like what my dad  Was receiving 
[01:21:30]  And what she got  In alimony  Wasn't even like  A tenth of the money  He was making  Like he maybe  Maybe she got  Maybe a tenth  Of his base salary  It was ridiculous  And then after they separated  He wouldn't even pay alimony  Like he would just not  Like send the checks off  So for months and months  She would just sit in there  Like piling up debt  Trying to you know  Make a living for  You know me and my brother  Yeah  And he just like  Refused to pay  Well like I said  When kids are involved  It's a totally  I'm not even talking about  Child support  I'm talking about alimony 
[01:22:00]  Well no  Let me tell you something  Alimony  When there's kids there  Like the woman  Can't just go out  All of a sudden  Get a job  If there's kids there  Because you know  Then there's babysitters  There's all kinds of stuff  Scheduling  I'm not talking about  When kids are involved  Well this is  No this is different though  Because I'm not talking about  Like the money  That he had to pay  For child support  Which I'm not even talking about  The money he had to pay  For alimony  Wasn't even like  A tenth of his salary  If that's where  You want to go with this  Then I'll say  Why is she entitled to that  Because they were married  For ten years  She got married 
[01:22:30]  Right out of college  She promised her  Support her  For the rest of  You know  For as long as they were married  Where was that written  Where is that written  What's the little quote  To love and support  No there's no support  There's not  You know  In any vows I've heard  There's never financial crap  Thrown in there  Oh I'm sorry  You know  She was  She  He moved out of the house  He got  Sort of got kicked out  Because she was sleeping around  But he moved out of the house  And eventually  He moved into a bigger house  The money  You figure the money 
[01:23:00]  You know  The bare minimum  Of a custom deal  Would allow her to at least  Stay in the house  That my brother and I  Had grown up in  No she had to move into  A smaller house  Which she still can't afford  It's ridiculous  I mean he  You know  The life that she's  Accustomed to  Yeah  Should be at least  Like what she  What she was living in  When he moved out  And she didn't  Even get that  Nah  She got completely  Screwed over  Like I said  I can't even get into  Things when kids are involved  I have no clue  Alright Ed  Alright  Thank you  Alright  Sid to what  Yeah right 
[01:23:30]  Alright let's go to  Tom real fast  Tom what's up  Hey how you doing  Great  I'm a child  Divorced as well  And my parents  Divorced 22 years ago  I'm 27 now  And my father  Is hiding out  In Long Island  Because my mother  By law  Is still entitled  To his retirement  He did a stint  In the military  And she still  Has rights  To go after  That money  Even though  Both me and my brother  Are fully grown up  Fully self-supporting 
[01:24:00]  My mother actually  Makes more than he does  Isn't that great  And real quick  And real quick  There's a lady  That lives across the street  From my aunt  Down in Florida  Whose ex-husband  Had to pay for her  To go to school  And get a career  So to speak  She got to keep the house  And from what I understand  She went out  And bought herself  Some breast implants  And while we were down there  She was flirting  With all the single guys  That were visiting  Because it was like  A whole gathering 
[01:24:30]  And she was down there  She ended up hooking up  With one of the guys  I understand  Just you know  It's unfathomable  I mean I live with my mother  And you know  I got to see  The mother's end of it  But you know  She did what she could  To support us  And everything  But my god  I mean to be able  To go after his retirement  Now is absolutely ridiculous  Just the fact that  She's able to go after  The lawyers  The lawyers  Yeah  Definitely  Anyway

I'm just frustrated  That's all  Well Earl  If you wake up  You can solve this problem 
[01:55:00]  You don't think I've been trying to solve this problem?  You get tugged in three million different directions  I've been tugged in three million sets of directions  It gets frustrating  I'm sorry  Earl  This  I'm not going to listen to any of your excuses today  This is the  Sorry  That's just the way it is though  This is like the tenth sticker stop in a row  That you've been late  What do you want?  Do you want sympathy?  You want sympathy for us?  Give me a helicopter  What?  Give me a helicopter  I can't help 
[01:55:30]  This thing I cannot control  I cannot control traffic  I can leave as hard as I want  But if I'm stuck on a damn car for two and a half hours  I can't help that  Earl  Hey Earl  Earl  But the problem is  You don't even try to leave early  I don't try to leave early  Earl  What time did you leave?  To go to Powerhouse Honda of 9  I was ready at 3 freaking o'clock  Things happened  3.40 you left 
[01:56:00]  You were supposed to be there at 4.30  You got there  Things happened  You got there at 5.10  That's just a part of the deal  Things happen  When you have an only guy doing this  Things happen  Doing what?  Doing what?  What do you do?  Leave earlier  He sounds like he's like a CEO of a company or something  Help me  There's a lot of people here  I'm still trying to  I'm going to hand them out  And after this  Find another guy  Okay?  I got it from a Negro  Earl  Earl you were born and raised in the New York area 
[01:56:30]  You understand about the traffic  You don't think I understand that?  I tried  So why didn't you leave earlier?  I tried to leave early  No you didn't  I came in early  Was somebody holding you shackled to your desk?  No it wasn't  Just things happened guys  Things within the office happened  Did you have to discuss a very important promotion or something?  What happened?  You can't give us an answer  Nothing happened  Nothing happened  In fact we were talking about the road show 
[01:57:00]  Ask me what  You had nothing to do with our road show  Wait what do you think I went yesterday?  Scouting out a potential road show  That's yesterday  Not today  Well it was me too early  What did I think of the site?  Earl you  All I have to say is  You were born and raised in the New York area  You understand that there's  There's traffic all the time  I understand  And on Fridays  There's traffic guys  And on Fridays  On Fridays it's worse than other days  And you know  That's why I came in early 
[01:57:30]  Earl you can get  You can get out of this in two seconds  By just telling us  What you were doing  Here at the station  That prevented you  From leaving  So you could get there  On time  I had to write paperwork  From last night  What paperwork?  I got the wow stickers  A paperwork for what?  To ensure  To ensure like  The promotion last night  I still let the paperwork  To ensure that he got paid  I did the wow stickers  And then I left  I talked with Matt 
[01:58:00]  So what time did you get  Into the station today?  What time did I get into the station?  Yeah  About 10 after 2  About what?  10 after 2  10 after 2  10 after 2  So from  Is that what time you  Come in?  No let's follow the logic here  So from 10 after 2  Until 3  I'm going to get that wow stickers now  And my battery's going dead  From 10 after 2  To 3.40  He gave out some  He mailed out some wow stickers  And he did some type of paperwork 
[01:58:30]  I did paperwork  Now couldn't the paperwork  Wait until  Maybe later on today?  What?  And couldn't the wow stickers  That you're mailing out  Wait until tomorrow?  You guys were  You guys were yelling at me  To get the damn things out  It's one thing or another  I got it  Get the wow stickers out  So I got the wow stickers out  Now how about  Getting to the  Locations  When you're supposed  To get that look  It's not one thing  It's another  I love you like  To go by law  I'm going to hand out 
[01:59:00]  The wow stickers out  I haven't even parked  This thing yet  I'm in the middle of a lot  I'm going to hand out  The stickers  And then I'm going  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  I'm going to press  The two buttons  As you said  To run down in life  But I am going  Home  I didn't say you  Push two buttons  I said you push buttons  You just need to manage  Your time better  That's all  I'm trying guys  But I'm one man  Oh that's debatable 
[01:59:30]  Earl  You really  Whatever  I'm one man  You don't do a lot  You guys got a bigger crew  You know what  Find guys from that crew  To do it  I'm done  No problem  I'm done  Well then what are you  Going to do with your life  Earl  Yeah what are you going to do  Finished  What are you going to do  I don't know  But I'm done  Okay  You find a real job  That would be amazing  I'm going to get his abuse  For this  We're taking  He's trying really hard  We got every sticker out  I got a lot of stops 
[02:00:00]  And it's not enough  For you guys  I am done  We're taking resumes  For Earl's job  Immediately  Hopefully we're so demanding  On Earl  We ask him to be somewhere  With 24 hours notice  To be somewhere  At a certain time  And every time  He's late  Every time  But we're so demanding  And that's all  I ask of Earl  Earl  He hung up  Holy smoke  Dave what's going on  At night  I'm working down here 
[02:00:30]  At Powerhouse Honda  And like  This first of  This bonehead  Shows up late  And now  We're part of  A dead end street  He's all the way  At the dead end street  Around the corner  Nobody even sees the van  Alright see  He'll get it  I mean you know  He's on the dead end street  All the way down the block  Alright Dave  Thank you  Alright bro  We just take pride  In what we do  I mean Powerhouse Honda  Of Nyack  I believe they pay money  To have us stop by  To give out these stickers  We don't need someone  Showing up an hour late 
[02:01:00]  Makes us look bad  The sloth  This is a guy  I don't know if the listeners  Can completely understand  What Earl does  But this is a guy  That comes in here  And I swear to you  For the two years  We've been here  We do not have a clue  As to what he does  Or has done  Since he has been  With WNAW  We don't know  No one in here  Can tell me  And I've asked  A few times 
[02:01:30]  We've asked  What does Earl do  I don't know  What's his title  No one knows  What does he do  No one knows  So then we figure  We'll throw the guy a bone  We'll give him something to do  With the show  So if the boss asks  What does he do  At least he'll have an answer  And not get thrown out the door  But he can't even do that  He can't even make it  To these locations  He comes strolling in  After two  Two  And he can't be there on time 
[02:02:00]  Because he's doing something  That I can't figure out  What that is either  And he can't even explain it  Yeah maybe he does  Mrs. Scott's up  Fine  Okay  Where's Earl  Coming  Coming  Coming  Virgin  Yes he is  And we get frustrated  Every day  Because we have these  Sticker stops  That start at 430  And every day  Without fail  You guys have been listening  For the last two weeks  I'm sure Earl left 
[02:02:30]  And he's on the road by now  He's got to call  All the way up to  Powerhouse Honda of Nyack  Oh no he's  And then he walks by  The studio door  At 340  Don't know what the hell  He's doing  And then he gets mad at us  Because we call him out on it  I don't know what he's doing  Back there  He's got his own little cubicle now  Where no one could see him  It's like  You first  To get to his cubicle  You've got to go through  A rat maze  And he's there  At some secluded  Little window location  Where no one sees him  No one sees him back there  I don't know  What he's doing back there 
[02:03:00]  He can spank out a batch  He's nibbling on the cheese  That he found in the maze  But I don't know  And no one can answer me  We should ask our own boss  What he does  Could you tell us  What Earl does  Yeah get Pip on the phone  Where's Pip  Now you know usually  I wouldn't normally  Want to do this  Because you never really  Want to let the boss  On to what people  Are doing around here  Because it's none  Of their business really  If you could go through life  And you're at a job 
[02:03:30]  Going in and make it look  Like you're doing something  And get paid  That's fine  But I don't know  What the hell he's doing  Maybe Pip knows  What his title is  And what he's done  Doesn't he have to  Answer to Pip  Yes he does  Okay  So I'm sure Pip  Might understand  What he does  And what he's done  In this past week  We have a whole week  From Monday through Friday  What did Earl do  Vanjie  Hi how are you guys  Alright  Listen if you're  Going to get rid of Earl  Can I be the next  Poken Negro  Yeah  Are you a little

Alright Vanjie  Thank you  Okay take care guys  Bye  Bye  Alright  Well  We don't know  Earl might have quit today  Yeah  Right  Could you imagine  That guy  Going out  And actually getting

Unfortunately yes  God I can't take much more of this  The tired  I feel retarded just going through this  The tired Spaz  Who only had two hours sleep last night  Look at him  He looks like he's  He's not hurling  I slept two hours  I was a privilege 
[02:25:00]  Introducing the dancers  He's got a new gig  Introducing dancers at privilege  What is that all about?  What?  Like  If I'm going to a strip club  Am I going there because the chicks are hot  And I want to check it out  And throw some bucks down some G-strings  Or see Spaz?  You know?  What were they paying you for?  To just be there and say  Hi  What line did you use last night?  Give us some  Wait not yet  Do we have any Motley Crue or anything? 
[02:25:30]  I want to hear what Spaz's line was from last night  Get in the whole mood here  Get in that whole strip club mood  You gotta play Motley Crue  When it's talking about the  Alright cause usually  Usually the DJs in the strip club sound like this  Give me some music  Yeah  How we doing privilege?  How we doing tonight?  Making our way to the stage is the beautiful Mandy  You might remember Mandy as a Dallas cowboy cheerleader 
[02:26:00]  And from our movies  Adal Intruders 1 through 10  Come to the stage right now  Let's give her a big privilege  Welcome Mandy  Woo  She comes out shaking her wares  And the guys go crazy  Wearing the boa  And the fancy Pam Anderson hat or something  Yeah  There she goes  Oh look  She's grabbing the pole  She flips that one leg around it  And spins  Oh look  She's hanging upside down by the pole  She's suffocating under her boobs  So that's how it's supposed to be done 
[02:26:30]  Everyone knows Spaz doesn't really have the announcer voice or anything  So I can't possibly see them bringing on for that  But maybe they did  So I just want a little example of your stuff  Alright here it comes  Alright here's the music  Just you know  Go back to last night  Okay  Here it is  What's up everybody  I'm Spaz from the Opie Dance of the Show 
[02:27:00]  I've been hanging around here with a couple of other show people  Same thing you've got to go Mark  And we're here because  Privilege has the most beautiful woman in the entire world  And let me just tell you something  The most beautiful woman  Women  Women in the entire world  They just put different wigs on her and you can't tell the difference  And I know that you like what you've been saying all night  So I know that you're going to love our main attraction  And I'm telling you  When Anna came up to the studio a couple of days ago  Every inch of her body is worth every buck you put in her cheese strip  And if she can rock Barry Williams, Greg Grady from the Brady Bunches world 
[02:27:30]  Then I know she can rock yours  So without further ado  Here is  Anna Romeo  Something to that effect  Something to that effect  And they're paying you the big bucks for that, huh Spaz?  Yeah  He uses the show and stuff  No, it's funny about it too  Spaz had to be there at 9  Yeah  And then  Was Earl driving him?  Had to be there at 9  He stayed till 1

I can't tell you that  I'm not talking about anything personal  I'm talking about what you're talking about  Yeah  I'm talking about sex, man  I'm just like a little groping this morning before you left  Yeah, a little kissy butt  A little groping  Alright, Michael

Hey  Look, I just want to put on a preemptive F.U. to Spaz  Everybody not even giving him a chance  Yeah, for anything stupid he's about to say to embarrass college graduates around the country  Alright, very good  Three dreams, precious  Thank you  Whoa  Steven, what's going on? 
[02:29:00]  Hey, how you guys doing today over there?  Great  Hey, got to tell you  I just put a WOW sticker on the car yesterday  First time out there  Just got WOW on the VanWick Expressway  Yeah  Yeah  I got a double WOW  The only thing is I got this sticker from Earl  Yeah  And a guy flashed me, Tim  Wow  But, I mean, hey, it works  I'll let everybody know they are working  Well, we know it works  It's up to the people out there to figure it out for themselves  It is cool  It's definitely cool  Let's give a big F you, though  To Earl for goofing up everybody else 
[02:29:30]  Up in NIAC  Alright, well  Really fast, we got to go to Mark on line 11  Because I guess Earl is bugging out at the appearance  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, man  All down here is bugging, man  What's the matter?  He's just yelling and screaming  He's like, F these people  I ain't doing this crap no more  They're going to have to find somebody else to mail out these stickers  A parking lot's a parking lot  You can't move  You can't move  He's going to need some serious, like, psychological help 
[02:30:00]  He's freaking out  He's like, seriously bugging  That's someone else we're putting in therapy  You know, when I used to go to, like, radio station events  When I was, you know, growing up and stuff  You know, you got there  The van was perfectly placed in front of the client's place  Right  And the DJ was all nice and stuff  Would give you a free CD and a free sticker with a smile on his face  You hear the mess we got going on up there  It's mind-boggling  All right  Thank you, Mark  All right, man  Bye  Bye  Jason's saying you did a great job at Privilege last night 
[02:30:30]  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  I'm up  I was there last night  I mean, you know, I thought Spaz did a pretty good job  You know, for, you know, he was there  He introduced the girls  It was cool  That's cool  You know, I mean, the guys are busting his chops  I mean, you know, it's funny to, you know, bust his balls and stuff  But he's doing all right  Okay, I'm Spaz fan  Well, it's common, sir  Hey, uh, syndication when Earl gets off CPT  Take it in  All right, Jason  Eric, what's up? 
[02:31:00]  Yo, okay  Check it out  When I first called you guys, I was in the Lincoln Tunnel  My phone was working  And I want to take the F out of Earl's job  Okay  I want his job  Yeah  But I got to tell you  I have the most amazing wow story from the Lincoln Tunnel, right?  I'm coming out of the tunnel  Guy in front of me is getting total brutality show  Okay  I pull up next to the car  I got my wow sticker on the back of the car  And we're coming out of the tunnel  And the chick sits up  And I swear to God  She just puts him right up against the window 
[02:31:30]  And starts rubbing him on the window  I was like freaking out  I was going totally nuts  It was so funny  Awesome  Yeah, kick out  So, syndication on the ground, guys  All right, thank you, Eric  Be quiet, sir  That's happening out there  We know it  Get the wow in your car  Okay, it's time for Spaz  Yeah  Weekend Review  It is now time for the K-Dawg Weekend Review 
[02:32:00]  Let's just kick it off right away  With a little bit of local news  Rudy Giuliani  Is in the newspapers  These past couple of weeks  With two things  Cancer  And his new lady friend  So  We noticed that in the paper  That he buys his new lady friend  A new diamond ring  Which probably costs him about 20 grand 
[02:32:30]  If it's real  According to specialists  And he's also trying to pay for cancer treatment  I think he should just try to concentrate on paying for that cancer  And probably he's going to have to pay for this divorce  That's what most men do when they get divorced  So I think he should just hold off on buying the jewelry for a while  And it's not like he's going to like remarry  Because who would remarry him  Anyway  I think it's a good strategy, actually  That to be in the paper about the cancer 
[02:33:00]  At the same time as the divorce thing  And the new lady friend  Because the cancer  Will dilute  Will dilute the whole divorce thing  With Donna Hanover  And this new lady friend thing  So  The press would more  Be like  On the sympathetic level  So would the masses  The people who are voting for him  Just appeal to the cancer side  And just not  Concentrate on  This whole messy thing  With Donna Hanover  No matter how bad he looks  In the divorce thing 
[02:33:30]  So I think it's just a good strategy  On Rudy's part  To announce the cancer  Right before he announces the Donna Hanover thing  I think it's a good political strategy  And I think that's why he's going to beat Hillary  In the second race  There you go  That's why he's going to beat  He's not running now  We found that out  Yeah  But he taped this last night  You're making it sound like  He  Like put cancer in him  To use  And you think  He better just pay for the cancer  Yeah 
[02:34:00]  Pay for the cancer  Instead of paying for what?  Instead of paying for the diamond ring  That he got  The lady friend  Do you know anything about  Diamond ring cancer?  Do you know anything about health insurance?  Kind of  Do you honestly think he's paying for the cancer?  What?  The insurance pays for all of it?  Paying for it?  Ah, the insurance will probably pay for most of it  I'm assuming the mayor has a good insurance  Probably a pretty good health plan  Health insurance policy  Yeah  But where do you get the money for that ring? 
[02:34:30]  I mean, come on, 20 grand  Who said he bought the ring?  Maybe he took out loans on his credit card  And he's like, 20 grand in debt now  That is just great  He's using the cancer  To help dilute  Dilute, yes  Dilute  Dilute  The situation  It's to shift the attention  Away from the divorce  Which could ruin him in the race  If he was still running  Yeah  So he uses the cancer  To appeal to the sympathetic side of people 
[02:35:00]  You don't think that the cancer thing  Is the reason he pulled out?  You think it's the divorce?  What do you think the reason he pulled out?  I don't know  Maybe his lady friend got to him  Maybe she had a factor in this  In his decision to drop out  Uh-huh  Now, women have a way with things  Yeah, well  So you think he's being like the Yankees  And using the cancer  It's great strategy  I mean, he's working for the Yankees  So what are the mayor's chances of clinching the pennant? 
[02:35:30]  All right, well  There's a lot  In that first story  But  That's great  Let's try to get another story out here real fast  Okay, moving on  Good  Ah  Joey Buttafuco  He came over from L.A. to film a little bit part  In a new film  Because  Apparently he thinks his 15 minutes of fame are still here  And  He was walking around with a new  Bombshell  Around New York 
[02:36:00]  From the set  And he's posing for the paparazzi cameras and stuff  Meanwhile  Mary Jo Buttafuco  Sitting back in L.A.  Still saying that  No  I stand by my man  He's not going to cheat on me again  He never  Cheated on Amy  With me with Amy Fisher  And everything like that  Okay  Okay  I think she should just get a clue  Are you going to get the rest?  It's apparent that he's  He's using his fame  To get these little bit parts  And going around with other women  And I think that the shot in the face  Should have gave  Mary Jo Buttafuco a clue 
[02:36:30]  So  That's what I think on that  Being shot should have given her a clue  Yeah  He's really serious about cheating on her  Really?  Yeah  It wasn't just a stage little event  Him with that bombshell  Who was the bombshell?  Yeah  Who was the bombshell?  I don't know  Some girl he picked up on the set  Oh  You know that for a fact?  From what I understood  Or was it just a friend?  He says it's just a quote unquote friend  But you know best  Yeah  I mean come on 
[02:37:00]  It's kind of obvious  What was he filming for?  A little bit part  I really  For what?  I don't know  Some B movie  Did you read it?  I mean we'd like to know  You know  It's just that I only read the movie  But I didn't read the title  Do you read these articles?  Where do you put them in time?  Yeah  Yeah we're going to have to let Steve in on this today  Steve from FoundryMusic.com  Kevin do you read the entire article  Before you give your editorial at all?  Not entirely  Not entirely  Do you just gloss over the headline 
[02:37:30]  And then just ramble incessantly?  The headline in the first couple sentences  Ah  Perhaps you might want to delve a little deeper  Into the article itself  Before you comment  But I figured that the first two sentences  Give you the gist of it  First two sentences  Yeah  That's why all articles  Are two sentences long  Spaz is a moron  From Manhattan  Checking in  What the hell is that sound he makes?  It sounds like a dodgeball  Just bounced off his throat  Hello?  Keith what's going on?  Hello? 
[02:38:00]  Keith go go go  Hey how you guys doing?  Great  What the hell is that with Spaz do?  What is he swallowing there too?  Yeah Spaz  A lot of people want to know  What is that noise?

[02:41:00]  Saying Spaz  Can't say two sentences  In a row  Yeah  We've never gotten proof  Of it  And he's just kind of  Given us evidence  So I'm just wondering  If maybe we can get  Some proof  On air  Spaz  Going past the second sentence  Alright Jeff  Thank you  Bye man  Bye  Aaron what's up  Hey what's up guys  How are we doing today  Great  Hey I just wanted to ask Spaz  A favor  If he can stop using  The phrase  From what I understand  When he's talking  The stories  Because I don't think  You understand  The god damn thing

[02:42:00]  There's a lot of great ones  Let's go to the next story  Spaz's Week in Review  Now we move on  To national and world news  An ex-bishop  Is now servicing  A sex site  Apparently he wants to preach  Still keep on preaching  To the millions and millions  Of Catholics  Around the world  About sex  But he's doing it  In quite a different way  As he teaches about  Love and lust  In a cyber sex site 
[02:42:30]  Called  Theposition.com  Now I don't know  This is just  This ex-bishop  Doing this  Is just a lens  To the theory  That  That priests  Really cannot  Control themselves  I myself  I'm a Catholic  I'm a Roman Catholic  And I'm pretty much devout  Roman around  With a brain  And I don't mean  Any disrespect  Towards the Catholic faith  But come on  It's not really helping  I mean we got also  Another priest  Who was in the paper  About trying to 
[02:43:00]  Molest a young boy  And now we got  Another ex-bishop  Who's higher than a priest  By the way  Who's trying to  Service a sex site  And I think you should  Just watch out  For the kiddie porn there  What?  I don't think  This is right  I think you should  Just keep it  Within the Catholic Church  Instead of going  To their own website  That is not related  To the Catholic Church  Teaching about sex  If you're coming  From the faith  What?  Okay moving on  What?  You see  I understood 
[02:43:30]  What you were talking  About at the beginning  Albeit it was retarded  But at least I understood  But toward the end of that  I totally lost you  What was that  With the kiddie porn  I was saying  That watch out  Because he might have  Kitty porn on his site  He's accusing a bishop  Of having kitty porn  On his site  I said could be  He's giving sex advice  Yeah but he could be  You know  He could go a little far  You know  Like having like  Doing okay sex advice 
[02:44:00]  You know  For little kitties  And using little kitty pictures  And stuff  Oh my god  To point it out  To little kitties  You're out of your god damn mind  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Oh my god  Keep your catholic porno  In the church  Don't put it on the web  Is that what you were saying  Pretty much like  Keep all your perverse  Activities that happen  In the catholic church  No  To yourself  No no no  What I meant  Like keep  Talk about  Talk about sex  In the catholic  In the catholic  Religious way  In the god sense 
[02:44:30]  Don't turn it into smut  By using a bishop's name  Don't put a bishop's name  To slut  To smut  What  Did you read this article  More than two words  A couple sentences  Is the bishop  Is he a bishop  He's an ex-bishop  An ex-bishop  Is he doing the site  As an aid  To people  To help them  Learn about sex  Or is it a porno site  It could be interpreted  As one  Read  Why are there  Naked pictures on there  To illustrate 
[02:45:00]  To illustrate  I got  I got to do  What was the site  Georgia  It's Georgia  Theposition.com  Theposition.com  Theposition.com  Mmhmm  Apparently under construction  There's nothing on this site  There's not even a 
[02:45:30]  A god damn  It's a black screen  That says  Theposition.com  Is currently under construction  What  You have this guy  Already distributing  Kitty porn  And there isn't even  It's a damn black screen  The website's not even up yet  And wrote it  Well at press time  Which was  At press time  You're calling  You're calling  What you do  Press  So like  While you wrote it  You call that  At press time  At press time  It was up  Anthony  What's going on  Yo guys  I'm graduating  I own  I want to thank Spaz

[02:51:30]  Yeah  Pope John Paul  Checking out  Yeah  Spaz  All this time  I didn't know  Devout Catholics  Could have sex  With their girlfriends  Yeah  You said you were  A devout Catholic  Just before Spaz  Most of the time  No  There's no  There's no  Most of the time  As far as  Devout Catholicism goes  When you're dealing with  God and his commandments  God doesn't say  Most of the time  Or close but no cigar 
[02:52:00]  Right  When you're living in sin  Like you are  And having sex  Out of wedlock  Like you are  You're in strip clubs  Accepting money  From strip clubs  For your services  That doesn't sound  Like devout to me  Sounds like you dabble  In Catholicism  It sounds like  It's a hobby  A hobby  Maybe  Maybe  John what's going on  Oh my god  Guys  I'm desperate  I'm desperate  I'm wondering  When is the perfect time  Listening to this report  Should I plunge  A pair of screwdrivers 
[02:52:30]  Into my ears  Guys  You guys  Suck syndication  When O.J. finds  The real killers  Thank you  Nah I like that  I'm looking  A box of rocks  Checking in  Anthony  From Jersey  Box of rocks  Hey we're pissed  We're much smarter  Than Spaz  Ponderous  F'n ponderous  Two  Two  Are we ready for  Spaz's weekend review  Anyway  Bob from Bohemia  Long Island  My three year old  Just threw his arms  Up in the air  And said  Who is this idiot  Is this what you  Listen to all day 
[02:53:00]  When God said  Come forth for brain  Spaz held open  The door for the  Next person  Three year old  Saying that  Okay  Alright  Back to Spaz  As we can review  God the feedback  Is just going nuts here  Yeah  Okay moving on  The Supreme Court  Has decided to say  That rape is not  A hate crime  Now if I might  I might  I want to get  A little serious  Here with this  Rape is a crime  Alright  Rape is a type of crime 
[02:53:30]  It's because  You got all these  Homeless people  And bums  Who haven't gotten  It for a while  Oh my god  Holy cow  What  You think the  Homeless people  And the bums  Are the ones  That do all the raping  And bums  Who haven't gotten  It a while  And that's who's raping  They're a little backed up  So you think  The majority of the people  That are raping  Are doing it  Because they haven't  Had sex in a while  Yeah because the sperm  Just gets to their brain  And it's like  Oh my god  So they just do it  You know  The crime of rape 
[02:54:00]  Rarely has anything  To do with sex  Spaz  It's usually  A much deeper issue  In the people  He's taking out  A rage issue  And an issue  Maybe  Of abuse  There's a lot of things  In it  But I think it's rarely  That someone gets horny  And decides  They're just going to  Go on rape  When it is  The sexual aggression  That builds up within you  Just goes to your mind  And makes you a little crazy  So that's what  Are you speaking  About yourself  Or  No  I don't do that much  I just grope  I'm a grope 
[02:54:30]  Mike what's going on  What's up  Hey  Hey Spaz  I only think  You're a devout  You're a devout moron  All of the time  Devout moron  Is Spaz  Is Spaz bouncing  A beach ball  On his nose  While he reads  This review  He sounds like  An effing seal  Cowboy Goldstein  From Queens  Hey Spaz  Don't feel bad  I too was a graduate  Of Iona  The 13th grade  And also  Cannot make sense  Of life 
[02:55:00]  You got a bum  On the line  That's pissed off  At you  Randy  Yeah what's going on  Guys  He's homeless  But he has a cell phone  I'm on my cell phone  And I'm just gonna  Wait outside  In my cardboard box  I'm gonna shove it  Over Spaz's head  And kick the crap  Out of him  Alright Randy  Thank you  Later  Vinny from Rosedale  I think everybody's  Being too rough on Spaz  It's not like  He screwed a tomato  Oh wait  I mean  He does know  Where a tampon goes  Right  Alright 
[02:55:30]  So we're in the middle  Of a very serious issue  That Spaz decided  To tackle today  Rape  Anthony  Yeah  And he thinks  That it's  It's the homeless  People and the bums  Doing all the raping  That seems to be it  Homeless people and bums  Because they're homeless  And they're bums  And nobody wants them  So they get a little  Anty in the fancy  And they just go out  And rape someone  Or someone who can't  Control themselves  And gets denied all the time 
[02:56:00]  From women  Just go out and rapes  Now it's very horrible  That these guys do it  It gives the good guys  A bad name  And it's just sad  That the Supreme Court  Is saying that  That women who do get raped  Cannot sue their attackers  I mean  You got criminals  Who can sue  Someone like  Let's say a criminal  Breaks into a house  And steals a TV  And he drops the TV  On his toe  Because the guy woke up  And spotted him  And surprised the criminal  The criminal sues  The head of the household 
[02:56:30]  And he can win  It's happened before  And if that stupid  Kind of lawsuit  Can happen  Then how come  Rape victims  Cannot sue their attackers  I think it's a whole bunch  Of BS  And the Supreme Court  Should get a clue  Sometimes they're not  Always right  And it goes back  To my other theory  That justice  Is not always swift  What does that have to do  Justice is not always swift  That has nothing to do  With what you just said  Yes it is 
[02:57:00]  And neither  Yes it is  Exactly  Yes it does  It's because the Supreme Court  Made a decision  Saying you cannot sue  Your attacker  So justice is not swift  That is not just  You can't sue your attacker  As a hate crime  Justice is not served  Maybe  It's swift  Swift means taking a long time  Swift means taking a long time  Justice not being served  Would mean that they  They don't get justice  They're not getting their justice  But that's a swift meant righteous 
[02:57:30]  Are you out of your mind  Right  Oh my god  Why are people sending me links  To retard webpages  While Spaz is talking  Pete what's up  Oh hey  Yeah  Antsy into pantsy  I want to knock him over the head  With a bricky wiki  Idiot  God damn it  Bricky wiki  Take care boys  Bye  A bricky wiki  Let's go to Billy real fast 
[02:58:00]  Billy what's up  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah dude  I'm telling you  This guy  This guy is killing me  Spaz let me ask you a question  Did you  Did you like  Fall out of a tree  On your head  When you were a kid  I mean  The rape victim  Cannot sue her  The person who raped her  You dumb ass  Spaz  She can sue  And she will win  She can sue him  For violating her civil rights 
[02:58:30]  Maybe you should pay attention  In class  Or you should have paid attention  In class  When you went to school  You dumb ass  Oh my god  I can't believe he walks  He talks  And yet he's not a chimp  Patrick what's going on  Yeah yeah  Justice is not swift  And either is spaz  I mean  Well what does that have to do  With the price of beans  In Colombia  Yeah  Not swift  I can't believe  This guy is on the radio  Yeah neither can we 
[02:59:00]  Alright  Man people just outraged  Anthony  Outraged  Alright  Are we done with that story  I guess so  Okay let's move on  To the next story here  So I just think  That you should overturn  That decision  And get a clue  And that's our justice system  Folks  Continuing on  We're done with news  Now we're going to  Head into sports  I only have one sports story  Today  Ricky Henderson  All I can say is  Thank god he's gone  He should have went 
[02:59:30]  Bye bye with Bobby Bonilla  With his little card buddy  There and it's only right  That Bobby Bonilla  Got traded to Atlanta  Because you know  He gets to sit with  John Rocker's punishment  For now for  Whatever the remainder  Of his contract  But Henderson  Apparently got picked up  By Seattle  And I hope he's happy there  We don't have to see him  Again in the National League  Because I just don't think  That you're ever going to  See a Seattle versus  Mets World Series  The Mets will be there  But Seattle won't  Anyway so  Bye bye Henderson  Thank god you're gone 
[03:00:00]  And quite frankly  We didn't need you  Anyway  We have much younger  And better talent  Anyway moving on  To entertainment  Atlanta's in first place  Jim what's going on  Hey what's up guys  Hey  He's killing me  This guy's killing me  I'm going to commit suicide  Listen I studied  In college  I studied subjects  Of rape and everything  It's got nothing to do  With what he's talking about  It's a psychological disease  It's a power trip  Yeah  You're out of your mind  You're crazy  What's up this guy  It's not a crime of passion  It's a crime of anger 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  And rage  Yeah  It's not like a power trip  It's a psychological problem  No it's a homeless  All backed up with semen  He's killing me  I'm going to jump  I'm going to jump over  The next bridge I see  I'm pulling over  And I'm jumping off  That's it  Thank you Jim  He's killing me  Adam from Jersey  If rape is a hate crime  Then Spaz must be  Getting some every night  We're on to entertainment now  Are we almost done  Entertainment  Okay the entertainment portion  Of Spaz's week  In review  We got a couple stories here 
[03:01:00]  A friend  Oh my god  Listen to that  Listen closely for the gulp  We got a couple stories here  Friends  The show Friends  Friends is the only comedy sitcom show  That I've seen in the papers  Bitching and moaning  About the amount of money  That they get per episode  And they're threatening  To walk off the show  And stuff like that  I mean  Talk about cry babies 
[03:01:30]  You don't see any other show  Bitching and moaning  About how much they get paid  Except our show  I didn't do this  Because our show's number one  And I'm a great actor  And everything like that  I mean you get  What the producers  Think that you're worth  Your producers  You give it all  You give it your all  And the producer  And the director  Will look at it  And say hey you know what  These guys deserve more  These guys are threatening  To walk out  What are they going to do  You're doing a show  For the viewers  Not for yourselves  Of course yeah  You're doing it  For a paycheck too 
[03:02:00]  But you know  The viewers get shortchanged  When you walk out  Because you only got  38 million instead of  40 million for a  Four year contract  I mean it's just  It's just totally BS  And I think they should  Just all grow up  And um  Anyway the show  Is on its way out  Anyway  It's been on  Way too long  There's not too many  Storylines you can go through  And uh  They've been dragging out  A few of them  With the relationships  And mix and matching  I don't know  I stopped watching 
[03:02:30]  A couple years ago  But still you know  They should stop itching a moment  And just  Do their show  And finally  My final  It's called negotiating  They're never going to pay you  What you're worth  Yeah but they're the only show  They have budgets and stuff  But they're the only show  Why would they come to you  And go you know  You are working  Hey here you go  Here's some more cash  No of course not  I wouldn't be  I don't know why  They call it friends  Like I wouldn't be their friend  I don't really  Like think of them as friends

[03:05:00]  Are angry with CBS  For failing to add a drama  About a Mexican American family  To its prime time lineup  For fall  And now the network  Could face a boycott  I mean  We need  Do we need an episode  About a Mexican American family  I don't even know  What it's about  Here it comes  Anyway  It's  We have a lot of  Minority shows  On TV  I mean  Look at Cosby  He's successful  I mean 
[03:05:30]  Just because  They're  Afro-American  Shows  And not Hispanic  Afro-American  Afro-American  Afro-American  Just because  They're colored  Negroes  Afro-American  I keep making a mistake  And not Hispanic shows  Or Mexican American shows  I mean  Like  Do we have to get a show  That caters 
[03:06:00]  Like one show  Per race  Or  A religious group  Or the entire world  So you think  The blacks  Having TV shows  Should cover all minorities  Because they are  An inner minority  Themselves  And they are  Representative of  Minority  It's like  Okay  There's the white shows  And then  We'll just give  Like the black guy  A show  Cosby  And that'll cover  Like the Puerto Ricans  And the Mexicans  Everyone else  Asians  Everybody  That'll be the minority show 
[03:06:30]  Yeah  You have the majority  And the minority  We are the representative  Of the majority  Please never use we  Don't ever say we  When talking about us  Alright here we go  I mean there are  Literally hundred variations  Of all these different groups  So we have to get a show  Per group  I mean there are a lot  Of Hispanics  In the acting business  I think that these people  Are just  Just finding a way  To use  Racism for another cause 
[03:07:00]  And maybe get  Their 15 minutes of fame  And maybe get  A little publicity  Out of this  I think it's just  Totally ludicrous  There are a lot of Hispanics  In the television world  And you should be  Just happy with that  Okay  I mean it's just  Total BS  Anyway that's my view  And that is the  K-Daw  Week in review  Oh  Oh  That was a short one  I'm too tired  To even comment  Okay  Terrific 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  Alright  That's great  That was a great  Week in review  I found a web page  Somebody sent me  Inspired by Spaz I guess  Real advice  Real retards  I guess they asked  Retarded people questions 
[03:08:00]  Like what do you think  About the laws  Governing the age of consent  And would we see  A decline in teenage  Pregnancies  If more awareness  Programs were introduced  In elementary schools  And then the  Retarded child  Answers  Do you want to  Pot up the  The computer  Do you know where  It is over there  It's the same one  It was before  What number is it  This one  That one  Okay  I'm in  Okay  Let's see what it says  Once it pops on
