<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, guest-hosted by Bill Burr, covered a wide range of topics throughout the broadcast.  The show opened with Burr recounting humorous anecdotes about his experiences at all-inclusive resorts, contrasting the artificial paradise with the surrounding poverty and referencing "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" to contextualize the economic disparities. This transitioned into a discussion of Burr's fear of sharks and Opie's shark snorkeling experience.

A significant portion of the show focused on the documentary *Grizzly Man*, detailing Tim Treadwell's interactions with grizzly bears and his death.  The hosts, along with caller Tony, discussed gruesome details of the attack, including audio clips from the documentary and graphic images (obtained by Tony).  The conversation included sarcastic commentary on Treadwell's behavior, the filmmaker's choices, the medical examiner's report, and a comparison to a documentary about Kurt Cobain's death.  A separate segment played a gruesome audio recording of the bear attack on Treadwell and Amy Huguenard, focusing on the sounds of the attack and its duration. Burr offered a reward for anyone who could provide a copy of the recording.

The show then shifted to Burr's personal life, detailing his purchase of a "Perfect Push-up" device, his hair restoration procedure (comparing his bandaged head to Chloe from *Fight Club*), and his opinions on reality TV, specifically criticizing *The Biggest Loser* for its manipulative editing and exploitation of participants. He also discussed his experience with the ShamWow infomercial and his messy habits.  Jim Norton briefly introduced the show, mentioning Louis C.K.'s absence due to child pornography charges.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to *Top Gun*.  Burr recounted a post-9/11 anecdote about mistakenly treating the Pentagon as a tourist attraction, leading to an encounter with military police. Opie and Jim Norton (with a Quentin Tarantino impersonator) analyzed the film's alleged homoerotic subtext, dissecting scenes and dialogue, a discussion fueled further by a caller, Brother Joe.  Clips from *Top Gun* and *Rock of Love with Bret Michaels* were shown, along with mention of recent guests, the two Corys. The hosts also debated the film's predictability and discussed airplane mechanics, featuring calls from self-proclaimed fighter pilots, including Rick from Oklahoma who shared an inappropriate anecdote about Tom Cruise.  A video clip of a pilot blacking out during high-G maneuvers was also shown.

Bill Burr's stand-up performance in Camden, New Jersey, was heavily featured, with audio clips of his improvised, profane rant against the Philadelphia audience.  The hosts and callers discussed the audience's reaction and the backstage atmosphere. The segment included brief tangents into conspiracy theories surrounding bank bailouts and a single world currency. Ralphie May was mentioned as being present in the studio.

The show concluded with a discussion about the future of humanity and societal structures.  The conversation began with space colonization, transitioned into a critique of the banking system (described with offensive language), and speculated about a unified planetary culture, governmental control, and advanced technology's potential for oppression.  The discussion also covered the Second Amendment, human evolution, religion, and societal collapse, with caller Ralphie Mays contributing to the discussion.  The show included a heated debate between Opie and Anthony regarding the response to Hurricane Katrina, with Burr briefly adding his perspective. Opie’s argument leaned towards self-reliance while Anthony argued for the limitations of that approach under the circumstances.  The discussion concluded with a commercial for Rob Zombie's "Halloween 2."  The entire broadcast frequently employed strong profanity and aggressive rhetoric throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Here's a great station with the fire.  Remember, Sirius 197, XM202.  All right, here we go.  Presenting a special edition of The Worst of Opie and Anthony, 
[00:00:30]  hosted by some of your favorite comedians from the Opie and Anthony show,  including Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, and Louis C.K.  Tune in every day this week as a different comedian from The Opie and Anthony show hosts  The Worst of The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up all you out of shape maniacs?  This is Bill Burr, and I'm hosting The Worst of The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  Actually, I'm not hosting it.  What I'm doing here is it's June right now.  I'm just running through like 58 of these, so I'm not even fucking here right now.  But if it makes you feel better, I'll act like we're doing this together.  How about that?  I'm hosting five hours of Opie and Anthony that you didn't get sick of listening for the first time.  Listening to for the first time.  Is that how I'm supposed to say it?  E-Rock, what are you doing here?  This is weird.  No, what are you doing?  You're listening to The Best of the Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  For the next five hours, we're going to play the best clips from the show.  You know what the fuck they're doing, so thanks for listening.  Thanks for having no life where you had to listen to this again.  All right?  But God bless you.  This clip is about my trip that I took to the Dominican Republic about five, six years ago.  And I lampoon.  I don't know what the fuck.  I mean, I told this story so long ago.  You know, like whenever you watch those carnival cruises or when they show people going to these islands  and all the great times that they're having in the bar pool.  Well, I actually left the resort. 
[00:02:00]  And I learned a thing or two about where Sammy Sosa is from.  So enjoy the story.  Broadcasting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Bill Burr.  Hey, are we going to do this thing or what, Bill?  Oh, the shark thing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I was backstage at the PNC Arts Center.  Yes.  And, you know, I'm getting ready to do like another vacation.  I'm just sick of doing these, you know, you go to those stupid resorts where you sit at the bar pool having a pina colada,  just some crap you've never drank, just somebody urinating next to you.  And then they always have like, they create this paradise in the middle of this unbelievable poverty. 
[00:02:30]  Just to the point, they have to build like 10-foot walls so these people won't climb in and stab you with Cohiba cigars.  Because they're so pissed off.  Let's really rile them off.  Let's build a paradise in the middle of this long.  There's actually no middle class in that country.  And you know we're doing something, drilling oil or, you know, put a military base.  There's something we're doing that's irritating them.  They basically, you land in these countries and they put you on a bus and they drive like 80 miles an hour and blow by all the poverty. 
[00:03:00]  It's like people chasing chickens and stuff.  And then they just drop you off at this resort.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  It's all great, man.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  So I'm like, I can't do these vacations.  I got too much white dirt.  I've been, hold on, before you move on.  I've been going on those vacations for, I've done 10 of those.  You've just nailed it.  Oh, yeah.  And I used to always sit there and be like, why am I getting all these dirty looks?  Like, I went to Costa Rica and I'm like, why am I getting all these dirty looks from these? 
[00:03:30]  And you wonder, why is the help so surly?  Because they're going back to their poverty.  They're allowed into paradise just to clean up our mess.  I finally warmed it in.  I bought this, I got this, I read this book.  It's called Confessions of an Economic Hitman.  Yeah.  This will explain why you get the dirty looks when you go.  Because I'm basically, if I go to a country and we had a war with them and we kicked their ass,  it's like, okay, yeah, we destroyed, we probably knocked down your famous statue, 
[00:04:00]  raped a couple of your women, casualties of war.  Now, I know why I'm getting the dirty looks and I'm with the result.  When I go to Costa Rica, it's like, I don't remember the American-Costa Rican war.  Where was that battle?  Yeah, but this book here, this Confessions of an Economic Hitman, it's written by this guy, John Perkins,  and it basically explains how through governmental loans we ensnare these people in this debt that they never get out of.  It's like brilliant evil.  And this isn't like, George Bush is an idiot.  It isn't one of those books.  It's just about this guy's job. 
[00:04:30]  He basically lays awake at night trying to justify the crap that he's doing.  It's like reading like Goodfellas.  It's like the mob.  I can't explain it, man.  I want to read that.  You've got to read this book.  Just put your joystick down for the love of God.  Joystick.  Stop shooting imaginary things.  How crazy that this show is?  I actually bought two copies because I was envisioning Opie ripping up one of them or burning them. 
[00:05:00]  I would actually read that.  Yeah, you want to?  Yeah, I would read that.  You know what?  I'm not buying this.  Go ahead and rip it up.  No, I swear to God.  It's really...  I'm a reader.  You are a reader.  People don't know that.  I'm a reader.  I'm reading about rats right now, but I'll read this next.  Where does this plug in?  Huh?  What is this?  Book?  What do they call that?  Can we get back to paradise?  Oh, yeah.  So, anyways.  We should keep going with that.  That is just hilarious.  That's basically it.  With the fake palm trees and the swim up bars.  Oh, and it's the greatest time. 
[00:05:30]  But it's literally, if you go over the wall, you're getting macheted like a coconut.  And they got these guys that live in poverty that rake the beach for you to make it really nice.  Yeah, they allow them to come into the paradise just to clean up your mess and then get back out.  The best is in the bus going 80 miles an hour.  They purposely do that so you have a better time when you get to the resort.  You get all nervous when you have to stop somewhere and you start looking around like,  We're going to get kidnapped.  Here we go.  We're going to get caught slipping. 
[00:06:00]  This guy could beat out Sammy Sosa.  Now he's upset.  They all love Nike and Puma, though.  They got that.  All the locals, they got their Nike shirts and their Puma sneakers.  It's because they stole them from work.  Make it eight cents an hour.  Yeah, those are the T-shirts that you find under the bed.  He's got a pair of Pumas.  There you go.  No, I just find that a little strange.  That's all.  Oh, that?  I don't know.  Like I said, I very rarely read.  That's why I'm suggesting that. 
[00:06:30]  What would their economy be if we weren't there or if these resorts weren't there,  if Americans and other richer countries didn't come there and spend their money?  That book basically explains how we'll give them a loan, right?  Like back in the day after World War II, they'd be like, hey, you want to get into the 20th century?  We'll help you out.  We'll give you a billion dollars to build a dam.  Then you can make electricity.  You know what I mean?  You'll bring your country in and you'll make a zillion dollars.  And your gross national product will go through the roof 30%. 
[00:07:00]  Everybody will love you.  And you get to be dictator forever or whatever, right?  The only catch was that you could only hire an American company to build the dam.  So the great thing is the money leaves America and comes right back within two seconds.  And the genius is they still owe the money.  They still owe the money.  And then the fact that their economy is going to go up by 30% is actually a lie.  It only goes up by 8%.  So we show them on paper how they're basically going to be able to pay back these loans. 
[00:07:30]  So basically after three years, they're in this debt.  They default on the loan.  And then we come back like the mob, like, hey, now we've got a problem.  So how do we collect?  So it's the only way to pay back.  You've got to give us the dam, at which point we control your electricity, possibly your water supply.  Or you've got to let us drill for oil.  Who did we do this to?  Or build a military base to protect your country.  Dude, it is brilliant.  So now the only option this guy is left with is to basically say yes, sell out his people so he can still remain the leader. 
[00:08:00]  Or he goes, you know what?  F you guys.  I'm not doing this stuff.  And at that point.  We replace him.  I actually talked to this guy when I did this radio show.  He came in.  I go, what did we do then?  He goes, oh, you know, we sent out, like, hitmen.  Like, jackals is what they would call them.  And he just replace them with the guy that will be cooperative.  Yeah, like, he goes, you ever see those little plane crashes they have?  He goes, yeah, like those things.  He goes, really, is he sabotaged those little plane crashes?  Yeah, that they have. 
[00:08:30]  We did it to the guy in, like, Panama.  We did it to a guy in Ecuador.  It's hilarious.  And then, now this is the thing.  Now, if you can't get to the guy, or if you can't get one of his henchmen around him,  dude, you want to be dictator?  We do that.  Give him a PlayStation.  And they do this stuff, right?  And they knock off the guy.  They knock off the guy.  But if the guy won't do it, the last resort is you start a war.  And that's when you go out there, these guys, they're going to get us.  And we're like, then we start getting all freaked out about a country we don't even know where it is.  These Ecuadorians. 
[00:09:00]  They're going to kill us.  And that's like the last resort.  Dude, it's an unbelievable book.  You've got to read it.  And what I love about it, like I said, it doesn't, like, it's basically going back like 40, 50 years in history.  You know what I mean?  And there's been Democrats, Republicans, all that.  I will read it with a completely open mind.  Yeah.  We'll read it.  We'll have you back in there, Bill.  So getting back to the vacation thing.  You should have John Perkins coming.  I'm an idiot.  I just read what he wrote.  Getting back to the vacation thing.  So getting back to this stuff.  So I'm sitting there going, I can't go to these stupid-ass resorts and drink these gay drinks that I never drink. 
[00:09:30]  You're an umbrella.  Huh?  On vacation.  Banana daiquiris.  I know they water them down anyways if they don't spit in them.  So I was on some plane or whatever, and they had Johnny Damon on the cover, you know, with his new clean-shaven look.  Red Sox fan, I've got to read this thing.  So in the back, they have all these crazy vacations.  And they've got, like, all the usual stupid whitewater rafting.  I'm like, I'm not doing that stuff.  No.  You want to sail on a tall ship?  No.  You know what? 
[00:10:00]  I don't.  I want one with a motor.  What about climbing Machu Picchu?  Yeah, all this dumb stuff.  It's usually in the back of that magazine.  Machu Picchu.  So one of the things that they-  Yeah, the Incan civilization high in the clouds there.  So anyways, I'm backstage at, uh, it's been a silly morning.  And I was, uh-  All right.  I was, all right.  Payback's going to be a bitch, you know.  I was backstage at PNC, and I started telling Opie, because I remember you went diving with sharks, and I was trashing you.  No, just snorkeling a little bit, yeah.  Yeah, and you lift-  With the reef sharks.  He lifts his legs up as this shark goes by, because evidently, like, the shark- 
[00:10:30]  Ooh, he's-  No, we were all on a-  He's in a cannonball position.  That can't get him.  We were all holding onto a rope, but everyone did the same thing, because it's just a reaction.  You see him coming closer, and you try to make yourself as small as possible.  That's all.  What you really did was turn yourself into, like, a milk dud.  Yeah.  Probably made it easier to swallow.  Made you bite-sized.  Right, right, right.  What do you do, Bill?  Good point.  You're going to meet between your toes and kick him?  Yeah.  Like, what does a brave guy do?  No, a smart guy stays, doesn't even go out on the boat.  Very smart.  That's my thing. 
[00:11:00]  So, I was trashing you so bad about that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because I was talking about this the other day, and I even referenced you.  I go, Bill and I have talked about this, but you do it much better than I.  You go to these faraway countries on vacation, and you go on these excursions, and you're  like, well, is there any laws protecting me, or has anyone figured this crap out?  There's no governmental group.  There's no helmets.  And you realize the locals are simply just taking a chance with every single boatload of  tourists. 
[00:11:30]  Lift your legs, man.  Right.  That's the advice they give you.  Like, you would never be able to just, like, snorkel with sharks in America somewhere.  No, there's protection agencies.  They would have you signing a million forms, talking to lawyers, going through a training  program.  But this was in the Bahamas.  They're like, you know, yeah, jump in and check out the sharks.  And like, well, I guess people have done this before, so all right.  You just assume.  Four life vests.  But it's locals that just come up with these excursions, and they're not regulated by the  government or anything.  Oh, dude, as you go out there, you're just feeling the beginning of, like, a 60 minutes, 
[00:12:00]  like, episode, you know?  You go out, you go look at the sharks.  Mm-hmm.  It was brutal.  So anyways.  Go ahead, sorry.  So I'm sitting here looking through, and they held all these crazy, like, all of a sudden  they have this page, all these crazy, like, vacation things you can do, like, you know,  flying in, like, one of these F-16s and stuff.  So they had one here, dive with great white sharks.  And I'm terrified of sharks.  But I'm looking.  You actually go down in that shark cage, which is the only reason why I would ever go into 
[00:12:30]  one of those things.  So I was talking to Opie about it, right?  And he's like, you know, like, I hate going to the zoo when you just see the lion just  defeated, laying there, like, for the love of God, can you get me out of this goddamn  thing?  They look at you like, come on, help me out.  Yeah, it's like, Richard Pryor used to have a bit about that.  When he went to Africa, like, it was a real lion.  It wasn't the one that you saw at the zoo.  Right.  Yeah.  When you went there, everything, the grizzly bears, all of them, they just have this, uh...  They hang out.  If you could see him at all, usually it's like at the end of his tail, and he's in the  brush somewhere, never comes out. 
[00:13:00]  Because he's on to the whole scene.  It's like, I'm not going to perform for the man.  He's on the bench now.  Yeah.  He's not getting any playing time.  Yeah, I don't care.  He's not a grizzly bear anymore, nothing.  I like going to the zoos and checking it out, but I do have a tough time, because you always  have some ass, because, like, the lion or the bear is sleeping, so you get some ass with  the pebbles, like, throwing them at the animal.  Like, do you have to do that and show how ugly we are sometimes?  I don't even go to the zoos.  Oh, yeah, the animals are pacing back and forth, and they're sitting there going, you  know, we built this habitat?  Right.  Or they...  It's just like Africa. 
[00:13:30]  Or they start pounding on the glass with their fists, because they're trying to get their  money's worth.  It's like, will you let the thing be?  There's plenty of other animals that are moving around somewhere here.  I've got to admit, as a zoo-goer, I do want to see them go into attack mode.  Yeah.  That is fantastic.  Oh, when that video hits the TV every once in a while, I'm rooting for the animal every  time.  Oh, the ladies who goes down and gets, like, attacked by the polar bear?  Oh, yeah.  The polar bear grabs her jacket.  Because, you know, they were doing something stupid, and then, you know, and then they're 
[00:14:00]  caught by the polar bear getting mauled to death, and then you have to kill the freaking  polar bear, because obviously...  Because he was being a polar bear.  Well, obviously there's something wrong with the polar bear.  He's crazy.  He's got to be removed from this planet.  Have you seen that one where he literally has that woman's entire femur?  Oh, yeah.  In his mouth?  Oh, it's great.  It's just like...  Fantastic.  Chiller.  My favorite is the one that gets...  They pull the coat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The panda.  Yeah, the panda pulls the coat, and now they're stuck up against the cages there.  And there's another thing I noticed that, like, whatever the hell country that is, the complete 
[00:14:30]  lack of security, like, it's just, you can just walk right up to the fence, and, like,  there's literally, like, six inches.  Yeah.  And they reach through and can grab you.  Yeah.  Just enough so he can get his hand, just to keep it interesting.  Here in this country, forget about it.  You're 10 feet away from anything that could possibly get near where the animal could possibly  come up to.  Right.  So, what are we doing with the sharks there, Bill?  So, I actually called these people up.  It's actually, you know, it costs, it's like two grand. 
[00:15:00]  Jesus.  But they, my thing is, are they going to guarantee, are they just going to stick me in a shark  cage and be like, eh, I see, like, a flounder?  Yeah.  It's like, eh, we had a bad day, buddy.  Flounder.  Sorry.  Par for the course.  Plus, when I called these guys up, I got an answer machine, and it just really sounded  like someone was going to lose a leg.  And I was just like, someone's going to lose a leg.  Ah, and Opie and Anthony bit.  Let me run this by Opie.  I would do it in a second.  Where are we going to do it?  Where'd you?  There's one.  There's one off the coast of San Francisco, and then there was one down in Mexico. 
[00:15:30]  If you really want to get.  Mexico.  Let's go, you green ghost.  Yeah, you just know they have all the safety equipment.  The bottom of the cage falls out.  You just fall.  Wait a minute, I'm out of the cage.  And they yell, surprise.  We didn't want to tell you, we just wanted to make it a little more exciting for you.  The cage works like a piñata, gringo.  All right.  We'll just fall out.  We should do it.  You want to do it?  Because I do want to do it.  I would do it in a second.  I'm ready to find my girl.  She's like, you're an idiot.  She wants to sit in a. 
[00:16:00]  Can we just fly to Florida, though?  Make it a little easier?  Dude, do you think I know about the great white habitat?  I really don't.  I'll do some research.  How's that?  Do some research.  If you find one, then it's off.  Australia.  Continental.  You know, Australia's not bad.  Got to go there.  The Barrier Reef.  All right, we got to take a break.  Bob Schieffer, his last broadcast last night, and he cried like a little girl.  Did he?  Yeah.  Aw.  Katie.  Weepy old guy.  I guess Katie starts Monday or something.  That's sad.  Or Tuesday, probably.  What?  Did this whole idea just bomb?  Was it me?  No, no, no. 
[00:16:30]  I like it.  It was all right.  Bomb.  It was a great bit.  Oh, okay.  You nailed what it's like to go to these, you know, third world countries.  I thought I had it like 75% of the way through, and then I'm like, so then they have sharks  and cages and San Francisco.  Okay.  Hey, so this guy retired from radio.  It's out Friday wide.  That's bombing, Bill.  Okay.  Do you feel better?  I'll give you an example.  This is an example of bombing.  One more time.  It's out Friday wide. 
[00:17:00]  Wide.  That's bombing.  Okay.  He's just saying words.  What you try to do is relate to the audience.  Bill, you try to relate to the audience, and you did just that.  A lot of people have gone to these resorts in the Bahamas and Costa Rica and what have  you.  Okay.  Now this is awful.  Now you have to, like, cheer me up.  I apologize.  Oh, you nailed me for going, ah, it's a silly morning.  Wah, wah.  Did he say wah, wah?  Well, I might as well.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  All right.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, hosted by myself, Bill Burr, and we're going 
[00:17:30]  to have more of this stupid shit coming up after the break.  So keep it here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  Let's begin now.  And we are back.  This is so fucking weird.  If you're just tuning in, we're back here with the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Bill Burr.  Okay.  All right.  This next clip.  This was one of my favorite movies that came out in the last few years. 
[00:18:00]  It was called Grizzly Man.  And what I loved about this documentary is that if you've ever seen it, what it's really  about is just about acceptance, how you just have to accept who you are, you know, whatever  it is.  Because if you don't, if you keep running from who you are, eventually you're going to be  eaten alive by a grizzly bear.  So enjoy.  We've got Grizzly Man audio. 
[00:18:30]  Bill Burr, give us the setup.  Because we have new listeners.  We have new listeners checking us out as he throws a stuffed animal into the garbage.  He throws you out my stuffed animal.  Oh, Grizzly Man.  It's about a guy of questionable sexual preference.  Right.  Living up in Alaska with bears with absolutely no training, wildlife training.  He just goes by gut instinct.  He did it for many years and he finally got eaten alive by bears.  Yeah.  And then his girlfriend, his beard, came over with a frying pan, tried to hit the Kodiak 
[00:19:00]  over the head.  Yep.  Kodiak wasn't having it.  Nope.  And instead of getting the cheeseburger, he went to the Quarter Pounder.  He ate Grizzly Man and his girlfriend.  He supersized it.  Right, right.  He supersized it.  And he was a guy that wanted to be famous in Hollywood.  He was up for the part in Cheers that Woody Harrelson ended up getting, supposedly.  Dude, every failed actor, if they fail, they somehow came this close.  This close to someone.  Oh, yeah.  So close.  I was supposed to be Kramer.  I was this close. 
[00:19:30]  It was mean.  Kramer was right in the fucking room.  Right, really?  The last minute he came in, I had the part.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  And Bill Burr does a great Grizzly Man impression.  But here's the real Grizzly Man talking about bears.  I kind of think he was over ten feet high, don't you?  Oh, he's a big bear.  He's a big bear.  A very big bear.  Wow.  Grr.  Anyway, he was over here rub-a-dub-dubbing.  He's a big bear. 
[00:20:00]  Holy crap.  And I'm going to tell you, that doesn't even do it.  You have to rent this movie.  Because this fucking bear is ten feet tall, rubbing its back against this tree that if you drove into it in your fucking Hummer, you would go through the windshield and die.  And this tree is like bending over, like, get this fucking thing off me.  And this gag dude is like two feet away going, he's a big bear.  Yes, he is.  He's a big bear.  And these fucking bears are just, they're like weirded out by the guy.  It's like they're kind of full of salmon so they don't attack them. 
[00:20:30]  But they just kind of, every once in a while, they kind of snap at him.  And he treats him like a dog.  They get creeped out by him.  You can tell.  Wow.  On some level, you can tell the bears are creeped out by this guy.  It's like, this guy should not be here.  Does he know we can just kill him instantly?  Yeah, and what is that?  Yeah, what is it?  Tony in Cleveland.  Tony.  Wow.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, on my MySpace, a couple months ago I sent some pictures to Steve.  There were pictures of the Grizzly guys attack on Ogrish for about two weeks after it was announced. 
[00:21:00]  And then they had to pull him.  Oh, so they are out there somewhere?  I don't even want to see the movie because they yanked that audio of him being killed.  It's like, that's the fucking highlight of the movie.  Yeah.  They had the audio and they refused to play it.  Why?  A documentary.  It's a documentary.  They should have played that.  I didn't want to see it.  But they were going for a mass audience.  Yeah, I've got it on my MySpace.  If you look, it's got a picture of a cop standing next to just his leg with all the meat going and just bone laying there.  Is that really the pictures from this?  Yeah, they were on there for about a week or two. 
[00:21:30]  And then for some reason they jerked them off because the whole family, I guess, was having a fit over with them.  All right, we're going to put you on hold so we can go to your MySpace.  If it's really good, we'll announce it to the world.  Okay.  All right, thanks, Tony.  Hold on a second.  Get his MySpace thing.  It's MySpace slash Jim Norton.  I didn't want to see the movie because I didn't want to hear that audio.  But after three minutes of watching this idiot, I wanted to see him get killed by a bear.  That would have been a great finale.  But they don't play it.  They don't do it.  They copped out.  It's even worse, yeah, because the director listens to it and then just goes, you need to burn this. 
[00:22:00]  Like it was a big moment about himself.  Yeah, you're going to decide for everybody else.  Thank you.  Don't exploit this.  Yeah.  That I have.  Yeah, as we exploit the guy.  Exactly.  What a fucking asshole.  Oh, that pissed me off.  He's just afraid it'll be too graphic to probably get mass distribution or something like that.  He fucks an eight-year-old.  No one else should do this.  No one should.  We should burn this child now.  People should not have sex with children.  I saw that movie early on and halfway through it, I realized, oh my God, they're teasing 
[00:22:30]  it, but they're never going to play this audio.  I was getting so pissed off in the theater.  Yeah, that's why I don't want to see it.  For what?  Because it's in the documentary category.  You know what I mean?  Can we have a director on the phone?  I guess we can.  Why not?  That won't happen.  It's not a bad idea.  But they did kind of sell it like you were going to hear the audio.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, he's killed.  You're like, all right, this will be kind of interesting to watch.  I remembered that.  I remembered that.  All right, here we go.  Grizzly Man talks about the Grinch, the name of one of his bears, I guess.  I want to introduce you to one of the key role players in this year's expedition. 
[00:23:00]  The bear's name is the Grinch.  The Grinch has come on to be one of the more frequent bears here in the grizzly maze.  The Grinch is a female of about five years of age.  Oh, hi, Grinch.  Hi.  And she has kind of an aggressive attitude.  Hi.  If I turn around too much, she'll bite me.  It's okay.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you? 
[00:23:30]  Don't you do that.  Don't you do that.  Back off.  Don't do it.  It's okay.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Okay, what happened there was the thing, like, he fucking walks up to this thing in the... 
[00:24:00]  I mean, I'm literally looking at it like, they're going to show it.  He's going to get killed here.  Right here.  You can't believe, actually, what you can do to a bear, what it takes for these fucking  things to attack you.  The bear is looking at him like, dude, get the fuck away from me.  He's coming, hey, here's a big bear.  And he finally just went, like, this 10,000 per square inch lunge at this guy.  And then he starts scolding him like he's a fucking, like, a chihuahua.  Yeah.  No, no.  No.  I love you.  You don't do that.  And then the thing's walking away.  And he's going, I love you. 
[00:24:30]  I love you.  And the bear's just like...  You know...  Maybe the bears were afraid to bite him because of what they might catch.  Somewhere there's a bear in a robe right now.  A little honey tea next to him.  An 80-pound bear.  I just wanted a snack.  Careless.  Yeah.  Careless.  Hibernating in July.  He's all curled up in the fetal position, coughing and frightened.  His friends have to bring him honeycomb.  All he wants is the fucking Will and Grace box set. 
[00:25:00]  Other bears protesting to get him out of the neighborhood.  One understanding deer.  There is no...  See, I didn't hear any of this or see the movie or anything.  It's a comedy, Ant.  You got it, right?  Yeah.  All I've seen close to this are real nature documentaries where there seems to be a professional person who knows something about the animals teaching you about them.  Even that stupid Australian guy. 
[00:25:30]  Even he, like, kind of knows something about the animals and how they should and shouldn't be treated.  This guy, from what I've heard so far, has no business being among goldfish, never mind bears.  He has no clue.  It doesn't seem like he's doing anything that is benefiting our education of the bear.  You know, what we learn about bears.  This guy just decided he's going out with bears until one of them eat him. 
[00:26:00]  And he just makes up shit about nature.  At one point, he's laying next to half a fox.  Some wolves or something ripped this fox apart.  That used to be one of his pets.  That he'd name.  Technically, yeah.  What was his name?  I don't know what the hell his name is.  Foxy.  Yeah, this is Foxy.  And he's laying there.  I just don't understand why this has to happen.  It's like there's too many guns in the neighborhood.  That's the way he's treating this shit.  Another senseless killing. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I don't understand.  And then the idiot who's making the documentary hits like paws and he goes, this is where I have to disagree.  I believe wilderness is chaos.  It's like, dude, you're rationalizing with a crazy person.  Right.  That dude just went like, and you were like, no, I actually think it's.  He's like, any idiot knows what goes on out there.  Bigger animals eat the littler ones.  Yes.  That's how it works.  He did this year after year after year.  He got crazier and crazier.  And I'm convinced that he decided, all right, I'm going to just commit suicide by allowing one of these bears to eat me. 
[00:27:00]  Bear.  To eat me.  Suicide by bear.  And then there'll be video and I'll be legendary.  As that voice in his head got louder and louder.  Suck a cock.  Suck a cock.  I like pussy.  It's a big bear.  Kill me.  By the way, we got reports the audio was a little low.  We got a brand new copy, so you might want to turn down your XM so you don't get blown out.  That director really should be shot.  You're right.  That was probably a personal moment for him that everyone else had to fucking suffer because of.  I know.  I hated that.  Oh, yeah.  What a douchebag.  Beck in Florida. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, if you can recall during the movie, the guy had a fetish with the bear shit.  But every time he turned around, he was, like, caressing and holding it.  It's just one of these movies that's not supposed to be a comedy, that is.  Yeah.  It's in my comedy section at my house.  It's hilarious.  It really is funny on so many levels.  Caddyshack, Animal House, Grizzly Man.  He's got a sandwich between Caddyshack and Schindler's List. 
[00:28:00]  I forgot about that.  He does start, he gets more and more into playing with the bear shit.  That's just great.  That's fantastic.  He touches it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, is there something in there for you, Jim?  He's got a helpful rascal.  With his, what kind of haircut does he have?  Like the Prince, what is it called?  Prince Valiant?  Yeah, yeah.  He's got that hairdo going.  It's just, it's funny.  Oh, you know, the best part, do you have the audio with the guy from L.A.? 
[00:28:30]  His ex-actor friend out there, who turns his death into like a monologue, he's like trying  to like book an audition.  You can tell he fucking rehearsed it.  This thing is like, there's so many different layers, this thing's hilarious.  And if I described it better, that would have been funny too.  Well, maybe we can get the actor friend on the phone.  We should interview him.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Why not?  They're not that big famous.  No one cares about them.  I don't know.  Someone's saying the director's in Munich, Germany or something like that.  Is it?  Oh, really?  Well, we have audio.  They didn't highlight it as one of the best cuts, but it is, though. 
[00:29:00]  The director listens to the audio of the attack, then tells Jewel, ex-girlfriend, to get rid  of the tape.  So we do have that.  We'll get to that in a second.  But first, here's another clip.  This is a helicopter pilot that used to fly him in and out.  Would drop him off and go, oh, Jesus, this guy's nuts.  And then he'd pick him up like two, three months later.  That long he'd be there?  Yeah, he was there for like the whole summer, I think, right?  Yeah, he would leave right before they started to hibernate.  But the year he got eaten, he decided to stay longer, knowing that more dangerous bears 
[00:29:30]  were taking the place of the bears that were there that were going to hibernate.  I guess there's a whole cycle.  Like some bears go hibernate earlier, and then these really nasty ones that could survive  in worse conditions still hang around for another month or so.  And eat everything.  It's like being in midtown, I guess, and then deciding one night you're going to go uptown.  How much longer?  It's kind of the same.  It seems the same.  You would think it would be the same, but somehow something's different.  It's like walking around this area at night.  It gets a little different than walking around here during the day. 
[00:30:00]  Here we go.  Here's the helicopter pilot.  I think the only reason that Treadwell lasted as long in the game as he did  was that the bears probably thought there was something wrong with him,  like he was mentally retarded or something.  Retarded.  That bear, I think that day, decided that he had either had enough of Tim Treadwell 
[00:30:30]  or that something clicked in that bear's head that he thought,  hey, you know, he might be good to eat.  I think that's closer to it.  In my opinion, I think Treadwell thought these bears were big, scary-looking, harmless creatures  that he could go up and pet and sing to,  and they would bond as children of the universe or some odd.  I think he had lost sight of what was really going on. 
[00:31:00]  Broke back.  Yeah, that's the same.  This guy's fucking rationalizing it like the bear had a,  like, maybe it was a political argument.  Maybe that's why he killed them, you fucking idiot.  I'm Tim Treadwell.  Get to the chopper.  He had a falling out with the bears.  The bears thought he was retarded.  The bears thought he was retarded and said, hey, I've had enough of this guy.  Or he thought, that's a tasty treat.  The bear...  I'll go with the tasty treat.  I think the bear just looked.  He was hungry, and bears will eat anything. 
[00:31:30]  They're stupid bears.  They have video of the bear that ate him.  They're convinced that he actually taped him.  Yeah.  And you could just see it.  They make this point in the movie.  You could just see it in the bear's eyes that there was just a,  I just need to eat look.  Hungry bear.  He was an older bear.  And all the younger ones ate all the salmon, and this douchebag was standing there.  He's a big bear.  Old bear.  Can't hunt anymore, probably.  Then an expert looking at the footage, and this Tim guy is watching this bear dive really deep.  And Tim thinks it's great that the bear could dive that deep, and it's so cute and stuff. 
[00:32:00]  And the expert's like, that's not cute.  That's proven that this bear is beyond hungry and is going really deep down to try to get food.  You could see the cute picture of the bear sitting down by the waterfall, and he just  puts his hand in, and a salmon's on his claw, and he eats it.  Puts another one.  If bears got to work for anything, yeah, they must be hungry.  That's what the expert explains.  He has to work real hard to survive at this point.  It's not like the height of the salmon season, where you just scoop up as many as you can.  And what's funny, when you look at the footage of the bear, it literally looks like the bear's 
[00:32:30]  playing.  It's a scene right out of Bambi, because he's diving deep and then coming back on his back.  And if you knew nothing about these animals like I don't, I was like laughing.  Go ahead, look at him.  How cute.  He's swimming.  He's swimming.  He's just taking a break.  He's starving.  Yeah, he's diving down deep because there's no fucking fish left.  And he keeps coming up, and he's occasionally glancing over at this idiot.  I could eat that, I think.  Yeah, just go.  I think I could eat that.  Another step closer.  It's like finding a chick in the neighborhood who sucks your dick immediately. 
[00:33:00]  The bear's probably like, I heard about this asshole.  I can't believe he's really here.  This guy's for real?  I thought this was a goof.  An urban legend.  Do you hear about the guy that just hangs around?  He doesn't run away when you walk up to him?  No, he just talks.  No, he just talks to you.  It's a set up, man.  I don't like it.  Who did this, Danny or you?  The description on the next track is hilarious.  Hello, bear.  Why don't you take a seat right over there?  What were you thinking when you came over to this guy's camp? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  Track seven.  Listen to this.  Spirit, the fox's cub ghost, takes Tim's hat and runs off.  What results can only be described as fag mad and could be the most hilarious audio ever recorded.  Fag mad?  The hat ends up in a den.  But Danny's saying this could be the most hilarious audio ever, ever recorded, Anthony.  All right.  Ever.  Hey, who's stealing that hat?  Let me see that hat.  Ghost, I want that hat. 
[00:34:00]  Man, ghost is bad.  Ghost, what are you doing with that hat?  Ghost, that hat is a very important hat.  Drop it.  Hey.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't believe this.  Ghost!  Ghost, where's that fucking hat?  That hat is so friggin' valuable for this trip.  Ghost, you come back here with that friggin' hat. 
[00:34:30]  If it's in the den, I'm gonna fucking explode.  Ghost, where's that hat?  But it's not okay for you to steal it.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  It's a friggin' den.  See, he sounds like he's chasing a toddler through his house.  He's in the fucking wilderness.  Right.  Ghost!  It's my hat.  I want to say that I mean this.  I hate Tim Treadwell, and I'm glad he's dead. 
[00:35:00]  I'm glad he's fucking dead.  By the way, his girlfriend's name is Ghost, too.  Yeah.  Damn it.  That's kind of funny.  Ring, ring.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  All right, here we go.  Oh, wait, the phone.  Here's the next track.  Tim petting and talking to Timmy the Fox.  Timmy.  And then he asked the public to stop killing and hurting foxes.  Do you know anyone that kills and hurts foxes? 
[00:35:30]  I know nobody that does that.  Bill, you.  No, you know what?  I've never heard of it.  I've never, you know.  Tally-ho!  We get up on horseback and send the hounds out, chase that fox.  Go on a fox trot.  Fox hunt.  Why not?  How often do you call your friends?  I'll leave a message.  We're out hurting a fox.  I'll call you back.  It's a different perspective, I do believe.  Yeah.  How many foxes could be hurt out there? 
[00:36:00]  Only Timmy is the boss of all foxes and all bears.  You're the ruler.  Look at my face and look at the ear.  Yay.  Thanks for being my friend.  This is so good.  Does it feel good here?  We patrol the Grizzly Sanctuary together.  How did we meet?  Over a decade ago.  He left his mother and father's side, promptly peed on my shoes, pooped on my clothes.  That was it. 
[00:36:30]  He was my friend.  Timmy the Fox.  Yep.  And we watch over things.  And he's the boss.  Takes care of everything.  Yep.  Yep.  Yes, I love my hip-in.  I think one of the things that's really important is you can see the bond that has developed  between this very wild animal and this very, fairly wild person.  And you realize he has this gorgeous fur and people are trying to kill him for it with  steel jaw traps and cruel farming practices and other people run him down on horses for 
[00:37:00]  a sport, fox hunting.  We want this to end between Timmy the Fox, this beautiful fox, and me.  We ask the public, please stop killing and hurting these foxes and torturing them.  Don't you think?  Yeah.  If they knew how beautiful he was and how sweet he was, they would never hurt him.  Thanks, King.  Holy shit.  Too bad two bears didn't do an infomercial.  Please stop eating psychotic faggots. 
[00:37:30]  Please just let them wander around your neighborhood without being harmed and eaten.  I like how they're playing that acoustic guitar music.  They're so trying to get you to give a fuck about this guy.  He had a good heart.  Yeah, he meant well.  The rest of us, yeah, we're all too jaded.  I like this next track because he loses his mind because he's talking to the camera and  it's not coming out right, so he does the lines over and over again, and he gets madder  and madder.  Listen to this. 
[00:38:00]  Timothy used his camera as a tool to get his message across.  Sometimes his approach was very playful.  Do another take here.  I fucked up the last one.  I almost just fell off the cliff.  I'm a fucking asshole.  Behind me is the Grizzly Sanctuary and also behind me hidden down below in those trees.  Somewhere is my camp.  I must stay incognito.  I must hide from the authorities.  I must hide from people who would harm me.  I must now even hide from people that seek me out because I've made some sort of, I don't 
[00:38:30]  want to say celebrity, but they come here to Alaska and they hear about Treadwell in the bush and  they want to go find him.  But they can't.  I'm hidden down below.  No one knows where I am.  Even I don't even know where I am.  That was pretty shitty.  Let's do a really short take here.  But as a filmmaker, he was methodical.  Whatever.  Often repeating takes 15 times.  One more really short, excellent take.  Let's just really sum it up.  Here we go.  This is going to be the motherfucker. 
[00:39:00]  Behind me is the Grizzly Sanctuary and also hidden down below is my camp.  For I must now remain hidden from the authorities, from people who would harm me.  For I must now...  From people who'd seek me out as a story.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  My future helping me almost depends on it.  I must be a spirit in the wilderness.  Fucking...  He's methodical as a director.  He's kind of like Kubrick, but without limbs.  Oh, shithead.  Rachel, my camp is down there.  Someday it will all be yours. 
[00:39:30]  The Peloponnes, my mutilated body.  What is a string of intestines?  Rachel, you've hit him over the head with a frying pan.  No.  If there...  I have no idea if there's a God.  But if there's a God, God would be very, very pleased with me.  If you could just watch me here, how much I love them.  How much I adore them.  How respectful I am to them. 
[00:40:00]  How I am one of them.  And how the studies they give me, the photographs, the video.  And take that around for no charge to people around the world.  It's good work.  I feel good about it.  I feel good about myself doing it.  And I want to continue.  And I hope I can.  I really hope I can.  But if not, be warned.  I will die for these animals.  I will die for these animals.  I will die for these animals.  Thank you so much for letting me do this. 
[00:40:30]  Thank you so much for these animals.  For giving me a life.  I had no life.  Now I have a life.  Thank you so much for getting killed.  That faggot eating bear does not get that picture.  Foraging lessons.  Salmon eating lessons.  I was going to make him a producer for Foundry Music.  Danny didn't highlight this track. 
[00:41:00]  But I think we should play it.  Because it says, this is the cut where Tim wonders why girls don't want to be with him.  Let's see what he has to say about this.  Because you're gay and you smell like bear shit?  And that's my story here.  For me, Timothy Treadwell.  The kind warrior.  The kind warrior.  Can I take it?  I'm trying.  Okay.  Yeah, I can do it.  Yeah, why not?  Why not? 
[00:41:30]  Across the halfway point.  Government's given me all they have.  So far.  I've stood up to it.  I've had danger in the boat.  I almost died.  I've almost fallen off a cliff.  Yeah.  The danger factor is about to amp up in the maze.  The maze is always the most dangerous.  Lord, I do not want to be hurt by a bear.  I do not.  I always cannot understand why girls don't want to be with me for a long time.  Because I have really a nice personality. 
[00:42:00]  I'm fun.  I'm very, very good in the...  Well, you're not supposed to say that when you're a guy.  But I know I am.  They know I am.  And I don't fight with them.  I'm so passive.  A bit of a patsy.  Which, is that a turn off to girls?  To be a patsy?  I mean, it's not that I'm a total great guy.  That means you're faggot.  I'm a lot of fun and have a good life going.  I don't know what's going on. 
[00:42:30]  I always wished I was gay.  It would have been a lot easier.  You know?  You can just bing, bing, bing.  You guys have no problem.  I mean, they go to restrooms and truck stops and they perform sex.  It's like so easy for them and stuff.  But you know what?  Alas, Timmy Turner was not gay.  Bummer.  Bummer.  I love girls.  Girls.  Girls need a lot more.  Need a lot more.  Hold on.  I've got to back up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  That guy is trying a little too hard.  Hold on.  Let's back up here a little bit.  No problem.  I mean, I go to restrooms and truck stops and they perform sex.  It's like so easy for them and stuff.  But you know what?  Alas, Timmy Turner was not gay.  Bummer.  I love girls.  You lie.  Girls.  You're a fucking liar.  I need a lot more.  I need a lot more, you know, finesse.  And I don't care. 
[00:43:30]  And I like that a bit.  But when it goes down and bad and you're alone, it's like, well, you know, you can't  rebound like you can if you were gay.  I'm sure I gave you my problems too, but as much as one goofy straight guy named Timothy  Dreadwell.  Anyway, that's my story.  That's my story.  He's like, oh, what a shame I'm not gay.  Oh, boy.  I'd like to be, but I like girls. 
[00:44:00]  Let's go to Eric in New York.  Eric?  Rachel, I've become bear hoodoovers.  Hoodoovers.  Or derbs.  Nasty bossy.  All right, guys.  Mr. Marshall.  Good one, Eric.  Well, here's Tim talking to a fox.  We're almost done here.  The Grizzly Man audio.  I love you.  Look at you.  You're the best little fox. 
[00:44:30]  But how did I come into this work, Iris?  Did you ever get the story?  I was troubled.  I was troubled.  I drank a lot.  Did you know that?  Iris, you wouldn't even know what that is.  But I used to drink to the point of that I guess I was either going to die from it or break free of it.  But nothing, nothing, Iris, could get me to stop drinking.  Nothing.  I went to programs.  I tried quitting myself.  I did everything that I could to try not to drink. 
[00:45:00]  And then I did everything I could to drink.  From the mule, he means.  And it was killing me until I discovered this land of bears and realized that they were in such, such great danger that they needed a caretaker.  They needed someone to look after them, but not a drunk person, not a person messed up.  So I promised the bears that if I would look over them, would they please help me be a better person?  And they become so inspirational. 
[00:45:30]  I thought he said a deader person.  That I did.  I gave up the drinking.  It was a miracle.  It was an absolute miracle.  And the miracle was animals.  The miracle was animals.  Sex with them.  Guaranteed this guy fucked something.  An animal.  One of the foxes, a bear, something.  I got to say, this is what's impressive.  You saw the pictures.  Yeah.  One of them, he's sitting behind a bear.  This bear is fucking massive.  I don't think that's him.  And this one has been disputed. 
[00:46:00]  They're fake photos.  This is a fake photo.  The other one isn't a fake photo.  It's a real dead guy.  This isn't.  But it isn't the guy.  That's not the guy.  I don't know if this is him, but there's a picture of a guy's leg that has been shredded off.  And his fucking hog is hanging out by his intestines.  And he's got to be packing seven soft.  And I'm like, in a panic mode, your cock shrivels.  So for this guy to fucking have a dick this big after being attacked by an animal, hats off.  And the animals even know not to eat the taints.  Look at that.  It's completely intact. 
[00:46:30]  So this is not him?  No, that's some other animal attack.  Why would the bear leave the best part?  Maybe the bear just sucked it and walked away.  I thought this whole thing was bullshit.  I like how his thigh is completely gone.  But his shin is there and his sneaker is still nicely tied on his foot.  And his leg is kind of almost like in relaxed mode.  Like he's sunbathing.  Yeah, like he's kicking his leg up a little bit.  But the audio, the pictures are fake.  They're definitely fake.  Those aren't the ones.  No, that's not the guy.  So you guys want to hear from the medical examiner? 
[00:47:00]  We got two clips left.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh, this guy.  This guy was a creep in the movie.  Yeah, you ever see a movie where it's just everybody's good?  And then they all go on to be like stars of movies?  This fucking documentary is like that.  There's not a B-list person in this.  Did you ever see the movie, we've got to get the audio, they made kind of a loosely based documentary.  I guess it's a documentary on the death of Kurt Cobain.  Oh, yeah.  That came out about seven, eight years ago. 
[00:47:30]  Kurt and Courtney?  I don't know what it was.  Was it called Kurt and Courtney?  The one that said that she was involved in the plotting.  Yeah, that she got a hitman to kill Kurt Cobain and stuff.  Yeah, that was it.  And they finally find this guy and he had a really scary name.  And this guy couldn't kill a mosquito.  I got to get the audio of that.  What was that guy's name in that movie?  I don't remember.  And then like a month or two after filming, he was run over by a train.  He was like a raging alcoholic that was in some obscure punk band in Seattle or something. 
[00:48:00]  It was another movie that was hilarious.  Yeah, not trying to be funny, it was.  You remember when he was driving in the car and he goes,  Right here, we were going to use some audio from Nirvana, but Courtney wouldn't let us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about, oh, you did see the movie.  Yeah, and he left that in the movie.  So it was these two like bumbling idiots.  They're like trying to like prove that Courtney killed Kurt, right?  And now it's the moment that they've been waiting for on film.  Their cameras are rolling.  They finally got Courtney.  They only have her for like a couple seconds.  And then all of a sudden the screen goes blank. 
[00:48:30]  And all of a sudden there's a voiceover going,  Unfortunately, at this point, our battery ran out.  Remember that scene?  Nice professional work.  Another one of those movies so worth the renting because it's so silly and funny.  I forgot about that.  I remember laughing in the movie theater and these people in front were evidently like big Nirvana fans.  Oh, dude, once again.  And they would turn around and go like,  Dude.  I'm like, this is pathetic.  I saw the movie in Cambridge.  And a huge Nirvana fan. 
[00:49:00]  Most people know that.  I was openly laughing.  But there are people in this theater, like you just said, taking this movie like it was the real deal.  All right.  Here's a medical examiner.  He had examined the bodies after the bears ate good old Tim and his girlfriend.  All right.  Timothy Treadwell and Amy Hougenot's remains came in this large metal can.  Inside this metal can was a plastic bag, one for Timothy and one for Amy. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, these are human beings.  And the question I ask is, first of all, who are you, Timothy?  Who are you, Amy?  And what happened to you?  I don't think you'll get an answer.  In the case of Timothy and Amy, what I had were body parts.  Just the visual input of seeing a detached human being before my eyes.  Makes my cock hard.  Makes my heart hard.  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah, he sounds a little into it. 
[00:50:00]  You know what you couldn't tell in the beginning is he has these big silver crates.  And he's like, Timothy and whatever her name was, his hose bag, came here in these crates.  And he, wham, slams down as this big creepy echo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He just looks like he's way into death.  Way into death.  How about an examiner?  Why does he act like he's never seen a fucking body?  No, he gets really into describing what happened to these people.  It's coming up.  From my eyes, makes my heart race.  Makes the hair stand up on the back of my head.  Makes the blood flow. 
[00:50:30]  Particularly in combination with the contents of a tape, an audio tape, that is the sound  portion of a videotape.  And when I find out from other investigators that the shoes neatly placed at the entrance  to a tent and the cap left on a camera so that the visual part could not be recorded,  yet the tape is running so that we can hear the sounds of Amy screaming and the sounds  of Timothy moaning, tells me that this event occurred very, very quickly, suddenly and 
[00:51:00]  unexpectedly.  I clearly can hear her screaming, stop and go away.  Maybe run away.  There's a lot of background noise.  Timothy is moaning.  And I hear Amy beating on the top of this bear's head with a frying pan.  And Timothy is saying, run away.  Let go.  Run away.  Run away, Amy. 
[00:51:30]  Run away.  Amy had a great deal of conviction.  She had a great deal of conviction in this relationship.  We know that.  Although in the past, she was more standoffish, she didn't get as close to the bear as Timothy  did.  She was more cautious.  However, I know that at the moment of death, when one is being tried to the maximum of one's  ability to be faithful, to stick to a situation, to be loyal, if one can say that to Timothy, 
[00:52:00]  she stayed there, and she fought with Timothy.  She did not run away.  Amy, we know, fought back for approximately six minutes.  Amy stayed with her lover, with her partner, with her mate, and with the bear.  Ultimately, she stayed with the bear in the situation. 
[00:52:30]  Definitely a James Blunt moment right there for her.  What was she going to fucking run to?  You're in the woods with a bunch of bears.  Where are you going?  Where's the audio of him explaining the injuries?  You just slowly sort of walk away, like, all right, Tim.  Yeah.  Take it easy.  It's the way you kind of wanted to go out, not the way I want to go, so I'm going to be  leaving.  I know.  She's like, you haven't fucked me in years.  He wouldn't have to tell me to run away. 
[00:53:00]  He would have been like, run away.  Where are you?  You're a puff of smoke where you used to be.  Here's the director or the main guy listening to the actual audio of him being eaten alive  and his girlfriend.  Go ahead.  I like just his brutal, like, reenactment of what they were saying.  And he was like, run away.  Run away.  It was more like, run away!  Yeah.  Get it!  Run away.  But at this point, there was a lot of background noise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't one of those quiet, getting eaten alive moments.  Wasn't mixed well. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  They really didn't have good mic placement.  This is the big bummer of the whole movie because they didn't play the audio.  But this guy, you get to watch him listen to the audio with headphones on.  He gets to hear it.  We can't.  So there might be some dead space in here as he's listening to the audio.  I don't know.  This is Timothy's camera.  During the fatal attack, there was no time to remove the lens cap.  Jewel Pallovac allowed me to listen to the audio. 
[00:54:00]  I hear rain and I hear, Amy, get away, get away, go away.  Yeah.  He's listening.  He's still listening.  Grr.  Grr.  He's listening.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:54:30]  And he's listening.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  He continues to listen.  Turn it off.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He stays.  Grr.  Grr.  More listening.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, where did that come from?  Grr.  As he continues to listen.  Is he laughing?  You must never listen to this.  I know, Werner.  I'm never going to. 
[00:55:00]  And you must never look at the photos that I've seen at the coroner's office.  I will never look at them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chicken.  Lichen.  And you must never look at the photos while listening to the audio.  Is that a man?  There it comes.  Now you know why no one's going to hear it.  I think you should not keep it. 
[00:55:30]  You should destroy it.  Yeah.  Thank you, Mozilla.  I think that's what you should do.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because it will be the white elephant in your room all your life.  She was later killed by a white elephant, which is an odd coincidence of that situation.  You must burn it too much.  Dig a long ditch and get the people to load them in and cover them with kerosene and burn  them so we are not, our crimes will not be seen.  Oh.  Oh.  The tape. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  Burn the tape.  You should never listen to this while looking at those pictures while having your ass eaten  on a bear rug near a fireplace.  Freep.  Cockblock Nazi.  What did the girlfriend look like?  Oof.  She looked like she could have been in the woods.  Really?  Being filmed.  The kind of girl that had to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Also known as a fag hag.  Fag hag.  Fag bear hag.  Wow.  What year was this? 
[00:56:30]  A few years ago, I guess.  I don't know.  Something like that.  Did the audio still exist?  I think there's got to be more than one copy.  Had to get out there somewhere.  The cops.  They always do that.  Ah, the cops.  Hey, check this one.  The cops for the Christmas party, you got to think.  Murphy ran off the tape.  Look.  Yeah.  All the shit they've seen, they're like eating lasagna.  It doesn't buck them.  Right.  Well, I'm making an offer.  $25 to whoever produces that audio.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  That's a lot of money.  And tickets to my February 24th, 25th Albany shows.  Wow.  That's right. 
[00:57:00]  I don't think the listeners will be sending an audio of a bear eating somebody.  $25.  All right.  You owe me.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Listen to the pain he sounds.  No, that's him ripping a flesh off the bear's body.  Grr.  All right.  We'll leave with one last clip here from Tim talking to the bears. 
[00:57:30]  Well, I just want to discuss that fight with Mickey Bear right here.  He's right.  Oh, yeah.  He got on film a crazy fight between two bears.  A very violent, violent fight.  That was a lot of fun to check out in the background.  Two heavyweights.  And he's about 50 feet away from what just happened.  Well, I just want to discuss that fight with Mickey Bear right here.  He's right next to me here in the Grizzly Sanctuary on the Tide Flight.  Saturn off to camera left.  Mick, you underestimated Sergeant Brown.  You went in for the hit. 
[00:58:00]  He seemed to be rope-a-doping you like he wasn't that tough.  And then once you banged into him, man, he turned out to be one heck of a rough bear.  A very rough bear.  And I'm telling you, I was so scared.  I almost got sick to my stomach watching you fight.  And then when he knocked you down and you were down on your back, it was terrible.  It was terrible.  You can't win, Rock.  I'm not duking it out for any girl like that.  I'm telling you right now.  I'm not duking it out for any girl.  But I, you know, I've had my troubles with the girls.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  And I'll tell you something.  If Saturn was a female human, I could just see how beautiful she is as a bear.  I've always called her the Michelle Pfeiffer of bears out here.  Michelle Pfeiffer.  All right.  You lay there.  I'm going to go off with your girlfriend.  Don't beat me up over it.  I'm cool.  Even the bag knows he's gay.  Things are bad for me with the human women.  But not so bad that I have to be hitting on bears yet.  The bear's like, yeah, fine.  You can sleep in the same bed with her.  I don't care.  Right.  That guy.  The bear looks like Helvina. 
[00:59:00]  That guy is so gay and so in denial that he's got to say things like that.  I've had some trouble with the women.  But, you know, don't worry about it.  It is a movie of acceptance.  It's unbelievable.  Through the whole film, he's talking about girls.  It's why he's there.  He doesn't understand why people think he's gay.  He's not gay.  It's why he was drinking.  It's why he's better to be gay.  Finally, he's attacked by some fucking bear in skinhead boots that doesn't approve of his lifestyle. 
[00:59:30]  That's a little taste.  The movie is just terrific.  That's a little taste.  That's funny.  A little taste.  Michelle Pfeiffer bear.  Michelle Pfeiffer.  What's that call her?  Before we go to break.  The first half of that whole clip CD you played, I thought it was still Mario Cantone's Grammy commentary.  Oh, that was from the Grammys?  Yeah.  Well, it was after.  The view the next day.  Oh.  The view.  He's funny, man.  He just does all the voices.  All the girls just got together.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Was his angle like a gay thing or no?  He didn't do that again, did he?  That angle.  I don't think he's changed that act.  It's a 45 degree.  It's actually a 90 degree angle when he's on his back and his legs are straight up in the air.  It's the angle he takes.  I'm going to call you Liza, you bear, you big bear.  Oh, stop eating me.  When VH1 does the Tim Treadwell story starring Mario Cantone. 
[01:00:30]  They'll do it like a clip show like fucking the 80s where everybody chimes in and comments on what a fucking...  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Some funny bear eating anecdote.  Yeah.  Someone's saying the audio still exists.  Jeff in Houston.  Yeah.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, um, on the Discovery Channel when they aired it, by the way, thanks, Oprah for having  me watch that goddamn drivel, they had a roundtable discussion after it was over and they 
[01:01:00]  talked and the girl talked about how she never did destroy the audio.  So it's still there somewhere.  Someone break into our house and get it for us.  Yeah.  I'll give you it.  $25.  That's right.  I'm willing to match that.  Wow.  I'll throw, uh, $12.50.  That's $62.50.  $62.50.  Ladies and gentlemen.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.

This is a public service announcement.  In, uh, this next clip, uh, this was during the period of time, I don't know if you realized,  Anthony went out and got himself some hair plugs and he quickly told me that they're  not hair plugs, they're hair follicles.  All I know is he was dressed like T-boss.  That's all I remembered. 
[01:02:30]  I just kept waiting for him to start singing, uh, what the fuck was that?  Crazy, sexy, cool.  What was the name of that damn group?  TLC.  TLC.  That's what he looked like.  And he's explaining to me the, uh, the brand new technology of how he's going to try to  look like he's only 51 years old.  So enjoy this one.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  Our old friend, who now lives in L.A., but he comes back, uh, from time to time, is in  studio.  Bill Burr on the Opie and Anthony show.  We were kind of catching up in the office, talking about Biggest Loser, John and Kate 
[01:03:00]  Plus 8.  Uh, what else?  Uh, Nutrisystem, uh, the perfect push-up and guns, so.  Yeah.  We got a full plate for, uh, for you, Bill.  How are you?  How come I can't hear myself?  There we go.  You bought the perfect push-up?  Yeah, I did.  I got the perfect push-up.  I actually got to admit, it is a little bit harder.  It's a nightmare.  To twist yourself.  It's those things that twist your arms as you're, uh, doing your push-up.  Yeah, it makes you realize that you're cheating when you do regular push-ups. 
[01:03:30]  Like, you're getting nothing done.  Because with the perfect push-up, they're on these rotating things, and when you go down,  you naturally, like, rotate, and it makes it a lot harder to do push-ups.  Plus, I'm so, I really bought them because I'm so old, my wrists can't handle me doing  that anymore.  I'd be going down like, eh.  It's actually, it's assisted.  You know what's funny is the handles are the same, you know, shape.  It's like a walker.  Yeah.  So, I'm basically, yeah, I'm basically inching my way towards that.  You make it.  I'll have, I'll have nice pecs, though.  You make a really good point because when you get older like we are, and you try to 
[01:04:00]  stay in shape in the gym, the joints, just doing sets, your joints just ache.  Oh, they kill, they kill.  I wake up now, like, I have to, like, when I get up in the morning to take, you know,  the morning whiz, like, literally my ankles.  I feel like Dan Marino.  I'm like, dude, did I play in the NFL?  I'm a comedian.  What happened to me?  And literally, he, like, caps are all, I got to, like, stop.  You're getting hip replacement surgery already from all the time on the comedy stage.  Oh, I lean on the wall when I relieve myself now.  It's literally just trying to hold myself up. 
[01:04:30]  It's brutal.  You ever have to go through your mind and try to figure out why something hurts?  Oh.  Like, it's got to get.  Because you want to rule out, like, a disease or bone cancer or something.  So, you're like, why does my leg hurt?  And then you're like, oh, that's right.  I brought in some groceries yesterday.  And it's just some stupid thing that you did.  You didn't realize that was enough of a workout.  To conjure up some muscle pain.  Oh, yeah.  I brought a gallon of water.  And evidently, I inhaled at the wrong time when I switched the water from one hand to  another. 
[01:05:00]  And I just felt this nerve pain start somewhere in the upper mid part of my back.  And then I'm literally, like, hanging from the door jam trying to undo it.  The girl's like, what happened?  I pulled something.  I switched the gallon of water from the right hand to the left hand.  That was brutal.  You used to be able to juggle with that.  And you'd have no problem.  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable.  I'm sounding like a broken record.  But I've got to say for you guys, there's only a handful of guys like Bill, Jimmy, Louis  CK, and a few others that do the show that are constantly working on new material. 
[01:05:30]  Some of these guys, they leave town.  They come back six months later.  And they're doing the exact same set.  And they're wondering why they're not getting discovered or going anywhere in their careers.  Well, I would say, Jimmy and Louis, they're setting the bar.  Good.  I think I'm an hour behind you.  No, Louis is on his 11th hour, which he just shoots himself.  Louis is like, I'm doing 90 minutes now.  I'm like, how?  But see, for the comedy, it's amazing.  It's all good.  But for the comedy fan out there, the guys that don't work on new material are kind of 
[01:06:00]  wrecking it for guys like yourself.  Some people are like, I'm not going to see Jimmy or Billy because I've seen their stuff already.  No, you haven't.  Like, you guys are working on a new hour, what, twice a year?  No, no.  Every eight months, something like that?  Every year.  Every year, okay.  And then you've got like that four months before the special comes out where you're frantically.  That's what I found.  Trying to read, you know, doing a half hour, that's no big deal over the summer to try to  come up with like a new 20, 30 that you're halfway happy with.  But like, when you've got like an hour coming out, that is definitely a sprint. 
[01:06:30]  You're starting to tell stories.  And my uncle was crazy.  I was trying to fill up that 45.  You tell in the middle to do, yeah, do 30.  Do 35.  That's cool.  We've talked about it on the show.  When we're having a slow show, we start admitting all sorts of crazy stuff.  Like, why am I admitting this?  That's when all the stuff comes out.  Why don't we just play Free Bird and go home early?  I don't want to tell people this.  When you're out of wacky news clips, it all boils down to, well, I was touched.  I think that's where the hair restoration thing happened. 
[01:07:00]  I don't think you were going to tell anybody, but it might have been a slow show.  And the aunt goes, what the hell?  I'll tell her when I did a little something-something with my hair.  Yeah, yeah.  I figured I would blurt that out.  No, it was kind of hard to come in and wear a hanky on my head.  I look like Chloe from Fight Club.  And I have pornographic materials and poppers.  I just don't have sex one last time.  He didn't want to go with the shaved head, so he did a little something-something up top. 
[01:07:30]  Those are the options.  I love that.  I moved to L.A., you say, I'm going to be a big phony.  And I come back, and you're getting the plugs.  No, they're not plugs.  Hey, soon before you do the commercial, will you step out of the pool and just shake off your mane?  They're trying to make it sound cooler, Bill.  It's hair restoration now.  They don't call it plugs.  What is the difference?  Plugs were they took this giant cookie cutter and gouged out chunks of hair from the back  and then gouged out a chunk of your scalp and traded places. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they did that.  So you'd have these big lumps of hair growing out of your head that looked like plugs.  Yeah, and it all looked good.  But, like, the front-line soldiers, those Saving Private Ryan hairs in the front,  they just looked like they took, like, your grandmother's sewing the needle point.  They stitched it in.  They stitched it in.  They were never able to figure that one out.  The front of the hair always gave it away.  Yeah, you've got to have bangs if you've got the plugs. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, you couldn't brush your hair back or anything like that.  Now they take individual hair follicles.  It's individual.  Each one is placed in your head, like, in the direction your hair grows and everything.  So it's not, like, a clump of 50 hairs at a clip.  They take, like, thousands of hairs and separately put them in your head, like an artist at work.  And they pop them in your head. 
[01:09:00]  It works.  It's amazing.  Each hair is finely selected.  Finely selected.  From the finest forest at the back of your head.  Yes.  Harvested from the best place, the back of your head.  And since you can't see it, hopefully they just put them in, like, in the shape of a penis.  Some kind of practical joke.  Yeah, we like pulling gags on people.  Right.  Yeah, do they give you the option to, like, switch your part?  Like, do you want to switch the part in your head, you know, from this side to the other?  I wonder if they could do that. 
[01:09:30]  It's like, yeah, you know, I want to switch this around.  It's like a magician haircut from the 20s, where it's, like, right down the middle.  Down the middle, I guess.  You look like you actually still own some gold.  Can I have the Harry Houdini?  I own some gold.  Wow.  With a handlebar mustache.  That's strong.  I'm going to be a weightlifter in a circus.  I got a peak yesterday.  It looks good, I got to say.  I was prepared to beat them up over it, but it looks pretty good back there.  It's just got to grow in.  You know, I got the front.  Got these little.  Please, please put it down.  I know.  It's already in the back.  What's the matter?  You look like you're going to go clean someone's apartment. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, the bandana thing is creeping us all out.  That is horrible, but it's all I can do.  When do you get rid of the bandana?  It's Chloe.  Yeah.  She looks like a video game.  When do you get rid of the bandana?  I guess.  In the new year, hopefully?  Once, Friday, tomorrow, I get the stitches taken out from the donor area.  And that's why the hat hurts, because the back of the hat band rubs right on where the stitches are.  Oh, okay.  And it hurts. 
[01:10:30]  So you'll be back to a hat soon, hopefully.  So, yeah, I'll be able to wear that.  And then we can finally look at you again.  Yeah, I know.  You want to have to look at this stupid bandana.  I know.  It's awful.  I know.  It's terrible.  You know what it is?  It's loose.  Yeah.  It's very loose.  It has to be, because tight, it winds up hurting, because the knot to the bandana is right  where the goddamn stitches are, too.  Everything seems to be there.  My pillow, when I lay down in bed, right where the goddamn stitches are.  You know, they don't show this part.  They don't show this part of the hair restoration thing.  They go right to their hair looking great.  It's the smiling guy with a girl riding a horse. 
[01:11:00]  Jumping out of the pool, skydiving.  It's not me trying to sleep going, ow!  Ow!  I'm moving my head around.  I'm tucking rolled up towels under my neck so I don't have to lay the back of my head on a pillow.  I've got a bandana question for you, because not in recent years, but over the years,  every once in a while, I'm like, you know what, I think I might want to try the bandana  look, right?  And you see them in the stores, all the different colors and stuff.  Have you checked with the homies to make sure you're not doing anything stupid here with  the bandana color?  This is an obvious crip color. 
[01:11:30]  So it is.  This is the notorious blue crip bandana.  What do you see?  And the red one is a bloods bandana.  So why don't you go with the neutral?  What's the neutral color?  Which bandana are we allowed to wear without getting shot?  Any color?  Pink?  Is it 42nd Street's the cutoff, right?  Like, you've got to know whether you should be north or south of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Here in New York.  So you might have a dangerous bandana on your head.  I would have checked.  You want the homies to call in and let you know?  You look like you killed someone in 78 and you just got out. 
[01:12:00]  I've got to get a tattoo of a teardrop on my arm.  He did all his time.  He never ratted on anybody.  Over a crank sale.  It does look like an extra from Longest Yard or something.  Yeah, I did my time like a man.  We'll get some of those.  He's just going to decide out of the blue.  We'll get the homies to call to make sure you're safe and where you're safe with that bandana color.  I don't think the Crips of the Bloods would look at Ant and think that he's a member or a rival member. 
[01:12:30]  I'm in their turf.  Yeah.  I'm not wandering into Bloods' turf either with my Crips color.  So I don't think I have to worry about that.  All right.  People wear red bandanas around here and blue.  What are you going to do?  I think if you're a black guy, you get more of an issue because they think you could be a member of the other.  I always said the other club, the other gang, but you, no one would think you are.  He's kind of got a little Latino look about him.  Maybe not true.  He does.  He's got that Jim Croce mustache. 
[01:13:00]  Mustache.  Jim Croce mustache.  Oh, my God.  I've been trying to shave it a little.  I've been trying to shave the top a little more, and then I take, you know, the electric  grader and really get it down and try to make it a little thinner.  It's very Nicaraguan.  Yeah.  I don't want a Gomez Adams, but I don't want a Groucho Marx.  But it's very hard to groom a mustache so it doesn't look big and, yeah, very Hispanic fatherly looking.  So you're chopping it down now, too, on this?  Yeah, yeah, on the side.  You can't remember putting it on his head. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Taking his mustache hair out.  They're selecting the finest whiskers from his face.  Finest mustache hair.  So does this creep you out, Bill?  What?  The look he's got going.  Well, the hair restoration.  No, I've seen guys.  He calls it hair restoration.  I've seen guys go through this stuff.  And does it look good in the end?  No, it's just weird.  It's weird for a little bit, and then you just kind of forget.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't think about it.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a ton of guys.  You see movie stars who are totally going, and then they're not.  Yeah.  The next movie comes out. 
[01:14:00]  They look like they're 18 again.  But in L.A., can you tell the guys that are getting this done?  You know what I noticed in L.A. is that only good-looking people get plastic surgery.  Yeah.  That's what I've kind of like.  Anybody who has the face yanked and everything, you can tell they used to look good-looking.  And now their face just looks really shiny.  They look like they just got over the worst ass-kicking ever.  Their faces are all messed up.  But ugly people, you know what I mean?  Like the people who should get plastic surgery, like Steve Buscemi.  Those guys that are just like, I think because there's no pressure when you were never really good-looking. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  When good-looking people, like, you know, when you go back to your high school reunion, no one cares about me.  I was just one of those, you know, guys in the middle of the school of fish.  Yeah, no one cared.  But, like, you look at the cheerleaders, the popular guys, you know, like, you know.  No one ever says, like, wow, Paul Giamatti.  Wow, that guy got old.  Yeah.  He really fell off.  It's more like, you know, like Tanya Katane.  Have you seen her on the show?  Oh, my God.  Celebrity Rehab.  We haven't talked about it much on this show, but what an awesome show. 
[01:15:00]  If you look at the old Whitesnake video of her on the hood of the car and everything, it's amazing.  And then now.  That was the hottest video out of all those hair metal things.  Yes.  Oh, absolutely.  What happens with her in that white dress dancing at the foot of that bed was insane.  What happens with the plastic surgery, you know, people do a little something-something and you don't really notice.  And then they cross the plastic surgery line.  Yep.  Tony Katane did it.  And know who just crossed the line recently?  Not that any of our listeners care, but look at Madonna. 
[01:15:30]  She crossed the plastic surgery line.  She's starting to look like one of those cat women now.  Well, what it is, you know, it gets to that point.  I don't care what age you are.  You got to put some clothes on.  Even if you're shredded, it's like you're 50.  Oh, you look great for 50.  You know what?  That's the thing about it is, like, I don't know.  Whatever happened to light, like, elegance is gone.  You know what I mean?  It's just like, you know, the new elegance is you dress like a whore.  Yeah, no matter how old you are, you try to get in shape and still the arms aren't right. 
[01:16:00]  Well, it's the ligaments.  Yeah, all you're seeing is ligaments.  Elasticity is kind of gone.  If Madonna would wear like a really classy dress, she would look unbelievable for her.  But she's still wearing that, you know, muff-shaved, whatever, leotard that she's wearing.  It's like, dude, you're 50.  The pointy highway cone bras and jumping out on stage.  Stripper body makeup to hide these spiderweb varicose veins.  I mean, there's just no way.  I don't care if you're doing yoga. 
[01:16:30]  I don't care.  You're still blowing out those blood vessels.  You're 50.  It's time to cover up the hoo-ha, sweetie.  Go the other way.  We were talking about Biggest Loser in the office.  I didn't know you were a fan of that show.  I actually, my girlfriend watches it all the time.  I'd take a peek at Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  No, but I don't know if this season's as bad, but last season I had to tap out where it was just like, I can't watch.  Explain it for these guys because I don't think Jimmy or I look at Biggest Loser.  But my thing, well, the reason why I stopped watching the show is like I was just so sick of watching obese people cry on TV. 
[01:17:00]  It's just one of the most unsympathetic things.  Oh, yeah.  Ever.  And they play sad music like I'm going to get emotional and I'm going to start crying because some dude can't stop eating cookies.  It's like, didn't I get a school collapse on a bunch of kids in China?  Some guy dies senselessly in Walmart and this guy, cookies taste so good.  I ate one.  I can't stop.  It's like, you know, put 20 starving people in a house.  I'll cry for them.  But, you know, it's fat bastard. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Living a level of sloth that only like Slash can relate to.  But they don't tell you with this Biggest Loser.  They're just using these people, completely using them for ratings because they have a gym that they're working out 24 hours a day.  They got someone watching every bite they throw in their fat faces.  And they're finished the second they look at the show.  Oh, yeah.  And then the show's over.  They're like, all right, well, take care.  Good luck to you.  And they go back to working 60 hours a week.  They got four kids to feed.  It's impossible. 
[01:18:00]  That's a great documentary.  They're just watching like their eyes tearing up as they're driving by Wendy's.  Right.  Trying to fight it.  And not go back to their old life.  It's so easy to do it when you're on this farm they put you on out there in L.A.  But when you're driving past all those fast food places.  Yeah.  Most of them.  Calling your name.  Most of them end up gaining most of the weight, if not more, after they leave the show.  But they don't want to acknowledge those people.  They make believe they never existed.  That's when I get into fights with my girls, because I always do that. 
[01:18:30]  When they sit there and they're like, you know, and the people get kicked off because  they couldn't, you know, spin a hula hoop for like nine minutes or whatever the hell  they lost to the competition.  All the fat competitions that make them do it.  Yeah.  And they're like, I don't regret this.  I really feel like I've made a change.  Yeah.  And I just sit there, yeah, I'm going to be fat again.  Absolutely.  It's all mad.  Absolutely.  A very small percentage learn the lesson and figure out how to make it work, you know,  in their regular lives.  Well, that's like on ESPN when they do that, that Nutris system with those guys, all those 
[01:19:00]  guys like, hey, if I can do it, anybody can do it.  By the time they edit the commercial and they get it on the air, the sports anchor is fat again.  Yeah.  Like that John Krupp guy.  He looks like a Rottweiler.  He's got one of those big St. Bernard.  He's got all the, yeah, all the punches.  And they literally, they'll show it during the time when he's announcing sports.  Sure.  Whatever the hell it is they do.  You know what I found out that they were doing, because it's illegal to have a before  and after picture that are reversed.  You can't have somebody that lost weight and then gained a lot of weight on purpose and 
[01:19:30]  then put a before and after picture.  They made that like illegal false advertising, whatever the hell they call it.  They were doing that?  Yes, years ago.  But they found a way to get around that.  The De Niro's of weight loss.  Yeah, yeah.  Putting on that raging bull weight.  Put on the weight.  For some reason they could take it off.  But they find athletes, they take out ads where they look for athletes that have had injuries  and weren't able to work out and that gained weight. 
[01:20:00]  And they take pictures of them for the before picture, knowing that once their injury is taken  care of, they're going to get back in the gym and get back into shape.  And then they lose all the weight, they're back buff again, and it looks like they used  this product to get into shape.  But what they really did was just get back into the shape they were in before they had  this injury.  So it's just more crap they're throwing at people.  Well, I noticed that on The Biggest Loser, like the first week, they just completely humiliate 
[01:20:30]  them.  They put them up on that scale.  They make them take their shirt off.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're in all their awfulness.  Let America see your fat.  Yeah.  It's a bra that weighs 280 pounds.  It's not bad enough.  They get them down to the least amount of clothes possible.  Oh, and literally like a six-foot creep.  That's for our pleasure.  On the side of their body.  That's for our pleasure as we watch at home.  But the second they start losing weight and all that, for the rest of the time, they  have like a shirt on.  Yeah.  They never show the loose skin horror that they tuck into their sweatpants.  I'm really being mean right now. 
[01:21:00]  This is awful.  Why not?  Well, most people are out of shape, and I'm trying to sell tickets.  So, I'm offending most of the audience.  That's true.  It's the holidays.  It's fine.  Eat up.  Come on, comics.  Have a mindset.  I like that.  Well, like Kenny says when he wants to shut you up, because I eat bad on the road sometimes.  I'm like, Kenny, I want cookies.  Oh, treat yourself.  He's always so bad.  Just treat yourself.  You're worth it.  Yeah, it's okay.  You work hard.  He's such an enabler.  Kenny is the little voice in your head, which when you don't want to do something, but  you know you're going to, that justifies it.  Kenny's okay with that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Treat yourself. 
[01:21:30]  Do an extra push-up.  Go to the gym tomorrow.  Yeah.  Nice, Kenny.  You work hard all week.  Ladies and gentlemen, the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  Hello, everybody.

[01:22:00]  Please support me.  Please buy a DVD and show me your tits during the show, unless you're a guy.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Shut up and listen.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Bill Burr.  Now hear this.  Hear this.  Sirius 197.  XM-202.  The virus.  Hey, it's Jim Norton.  Uh, Friday's worst of show is supposed to be hosted by Louis C.K., but he had to cancel  due to, uh, child pornography charges that he's facing in court and admitting to. 
[01:22:30]  In his place, a bunch of fancier gentlemen has been chosen to present this great material.  Oh, I didn't see this part.  So check it out.  Right here on the, on the, on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM-202.  Who wrote this?  That's his fucking, what creepy handwriting is that?  It's like fucking hieroglyphics.  Poor Lou.  Here with the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Bill Burr.  I love how I'm looking back on it.  It's literally five years and I feel like I'm on Johnny Carson right now. 
[01:23:00]  Like I actually have 40 years of incredible radio.  Um, this next one was actually recently.  It was, uh, back in 2008 when I was one of the, one of the zillion morons in this country  who actually bought the ShamWow and thought that it was, you know, they fucking have the  thing and they stick it in a goddamn aquarium and it sucks up even the gravel.  And then when it's delivered to you, it's not quite what you saw on television.  And here's the, uh, story that goes along with it.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony hosted by Bill Burr. 
[01:23:30]  I, I, I really am done with reality shows.  That's why it's a, you know, I really don't watch a lot of them when they come up.  I know a lot of people watch them and stuff, but I, I'm, I'm so sick of it.  A reality show, if it was real and reality, just let the camera roll.  But like you said, they put the music in, they try to tug on your heartstrings.  It's not reality.  They direct these things.  They write them.  There's a writer.  Look at the frigging credits at the end.  There's a writer's credit on a reality show.  Let the camera roll.  And, uh, uh, no, because if you do it that way, then you literally, to get five minutes 
[01:24:00]  of TV, you got to go through like 600 hours of food.  Oh, well.  Which made the real world great because it was real stuff going on.  And it went on for months.  They had to sit around.  Now I hear the real world house is like barely a month.  It's like two months.  It used to be six months.  Six months.  And they would just camp out in the basement waiting for those special moments.  And they were regular, like, people at the beginning.  Now it's a cast like that Laguna Beach show or one of those.  Yeah.  The sexy guy.  They're in the hot tub. 
[01:24:30]  Well, I think they're out of ideas at this point.  I saw one last night as I was falling asleep.  It was, uh, called Secret Millionaire.  Oh, Fox.  And, yeah, basically the gist is people who are millionaires hang out with poor people.  And I had to shut it up the second one of the rich people was just like, I had no idea  people, people live like this.  Oh, no.  It was like trading places.  Oh, it's the worst PR ever for white people.  Like, they were all that out of touch.  Like, I had no idea.  And I just, you know.  Never.  And then the whole stereotype, too, that rich people have no problems. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, Mortimer.  Like, nobody's getting molested in a mansion.  Yeah.  Like, that only happens in, like, a crack house.  It's like, come on.  It's, uh, they, by the way, the reality, they call it assisted reality.  Yeah, they just call it assisted reality.  Assisted reality.  I can't deal with it.  It's the same show.  Every show is the same show.  I blame.  There's different ideas, but.  I blame the Osbournes, actually.  The Osbournes was such a great show, and then they didn't want to do it anymore, and everyone's  like, well, we've got to find the new Osbournes. 
[01:25:30]  And they tried it with the Hogan family and others, and it's like, well, obviously we've  got to write material, because they're not as interesting as the Osbournes.  I think Sharon said there was never a take two.  It was, that was what they shot.  That was what it was.  The worst on these reality shows is when something happens, they put on this ominous music  and show, like, someone turning their head and looking at the camera, and they're  like, they're all scared, and you know that turn of the head was just like, ah, I've got  to go shopping later.  Like, it wasn't, it had nothing to do with that moment. 
[01:26:00]  There's these dramatic pauses that you know never happened.  It's like, well, then why did you do it?  Boom.  And then the person's staring at them, just looking.  And you know that in reality it was like, why did you do it?  Because I felt like it.  I felt like it.  Oh, okay.  I'll see you later.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they make it into this big thing.  It's all phony.  I can't deal with it.  What about when they have, I like when they clearly only have 12 hours of footage, but  they stretch it out over an hour.  So that literally, as you're going into commercial, it's like, well, then I don't want to live 
[01:26:30]  here anymore.  And then when they come back from commercial, they start the whole fight over again.  You've got to sit there for another three minutes, just get to the part of that.  Well, I don't want to live here anymore.  It's like, dude, you just showed this.  That's a new thing.  This is a half hour show, and you're making it an hour.  And you've got to recap after a commercial.  Yeah, that's like the stand-up, huh?  He knows what I'm talking about.  Come on, back me up.  Round of applause if you ever ate an apple.  Right, ladies?  Yeah.  Before we move on from celebrity rehab, that model, is that a hot story? 
[01:27:00]  She is the best-looking junkie I've ever seen.  She was a supermodel.  She was on the French cover of Cosmo.  I guess that's really important in the business, and she's very famous.  You would recognize her pictures from years ago.  Dude, she was so down on her luck and so addicted, she was hooking.  She was hooking.  Wow.  Did you get to that point?  Yes.  She was an escort. 
[01:27:30]  That turns me on.  Rock.  And now she's trying to get her life together on this celebrity rehab.  But she lost it all.  She broke that up?  I didn't see that.  Oh, yeah, she did.  Nice.  Get a picture of her.  Jimmy, can you imagine that?  You know, you're always praying.  It looks like the picture.  And she actually shows up.  It's actually her.  It looks like the picture.  What kind of messes are showing up?  Do they look like the picture?  I've never hired an escort.  I always did eye-to-eye on the street. 
[01:28:00]  Jimmy, do they look like the picture?  That's what happened, right?  Ant knew that Bill's a decent guy, but he didn't want to make it look like, I'm just  such a pig.  So he had to be diplomatic.  And he goes, well, Bill, what do you think?  Bill, Bill, I like the picture.  I don't do it.  Instead of going right to the source.  Let me look around the room.  Just random Jimmy.  Yeah.  This is how they should have went.  Hey, scumbag.  When they show up, sometimes they do.  A lot of times they don't.  A lot of times they don't?  Yeah.  Some of the ads, they'll Photoshop a head in.  It's so obviously not them because the lighting is different.  Here's the girl. 
[01:28:30]  You know what you should do, Jim?  You should actually make a copy of the picture with your printer, and then they show up,  just hold it up to their face, and then just shake your head.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Beat it.  Look at this girl.  She was so down on her luck.  She started escorting her.  She's on Celebrity Rehab.  Find a hot photo.  They're all hot.  What's her name?  Amber Smith.  Amber Smith.  Amber Smith, yeah.  Let's see.  All right.  Nah, that's not bad.  That's not bad, though.  That is way better picture than that.  Yeah, no.  She's like naturally gorgeous. 
[01:29:00]  Just go with the face right here to start.  And she had to...  Look at this face.  This is showing up.  And the body matches.  To your Super 8 at 4 in the morning.  Look at the face.  Look at this.  Your Super 8.  Right.  Look at this.  She started...  She...  The drugs got her to the point she was escorting.  She's actually better looking than that.  Yeah.  Why'd she start doing drugs?  I don't even know.  I think she was doing it the whole time.  Like a lot of these models.  She was...  Yeah, with her mom.  Her mom kind of got her into it.  Her mom?  I didn't hear that part.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I'll tell you what's brutal. 
[01:29:30]  If you see what her mom looks like, she looks like Large Marge.  And you're like, wow.  Large Marge.  That's what she's going to look like.  In the future.  Yeah, the mom is horrific looking.  In the future.  Well, if she keeps doing the drugs, she will keep the weight off.  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes it's bad when the girls stop doing coke and gain a lot of weight.  Happened in the 80s to that girl that was...  What was she on?  Not TJ Hooker, because that was...  What's her name?  The other blonde.  The other Heather.  Heather Thomas.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Was just a coke fiend.  And she was nice and skinny and everything.  And then she got all fat.  Stopped doing coke.  She got all fat.  Well, you know what's funny?  Like, junkies.  Like, hardcore junkies really are skinny for life.  Like Keith Richards.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  All those rock stars.  It's like Iggy Pop.  The guy's shredded.  He's like 62.  He still has abs.  Something about doing heroin.  Yeah.  He just...  Ooh.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, there she is.  Here's the picture of members. 
[01:30:30]  But she might have been escorting.  A lot of them escort.  Like, porn stars escort.  They call it doing privates.  But a lot of them make $2,500 an hour.  They got a corporate gig.  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  Tagging some guy from Exxon.  Yes.  They get a lot of money.  So she wasn't escorting, like, Craigslist escorting.  I'm guessing.  Right.  She's probably...  You know, she might have been getting three grand an hour.  Like, Playboy Girls escort.  Oh, like a lot of cash, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, real money.  I'm sure she did.  You could basically rub one out from across the room.  She's still... 
[01:31:00]  Act like you're on the runway.  Do that little turn.  But what you do, though, when an escort shows up who's got the picture...  I've only sent one escort away.  And she was...  I wanted this blonde girl.  And this brunette, kind of heavy, showed up.  And she was nice.  Did the penis bother you, or...?  No, no, no.  She actually didn't have one, which bothered me.  I'm like, look, this said blonde, passable, and fully functional.  Explanation?  False advertising.  It was a really skinny blonde girl. 
[01:31:30]  And I said to the girl on the phone, if the girl in this picture doesn't show up, I'm going to send her back.  And she goes, no, no, no, it's her.  Totally different girl.  And the girl showed up, and she was nice.  And I go, look, you're not the girl I asked for.  You're very pretty.  But I had it, and I showed her on the computer.  This is the girl they told me was coming.  And she goes, yeah, they do that sometimes.  And I called the lady.  I'm like, this is the girl you told me.  Why did you send somebody else?  She just lied to me.  And she goes, well, put her on the phone.  And the girl's like, okay.  And she was going to leave.  I just gave her 50 bucks for coming because I felt bad for her. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, you were nice about it.  It wasn't the escort's fault.  It was a scumbag agency.  I asked for a skinny blonde.  You are a fat brunette.  No, I even said she's very pretty.  But, you know, I'm like, I had a particular thing for this one girl.  And that's what you told me.  And, you know, I wasn't a dick about it.  Bastards.  Yeah.  I was going to call the police, but I figured.  Probably not a good idea.  Yeah.  I like how you called up an escort service.  You're like, why did you lie to me?  Yeah.  Most people just be like, ah.  This entire thing is a lie.  This girl really doesn't like you.  Go in, throw her a bang in, give her her money, and then have her leave while you're all 
[01:32:30]  disappointed and mad that you gave her money.  And then, who calls?  I just didn't feel like there was enough honesty.  Yeah.  Who calls?  Jimmy wants scrumples.  I do.  Yeah, we need some, you know.  We want this to be on the up and up.  I want some honesty in this business.  I'm bringing honesty back to prostitution.  What kind of whorehouse are you running?  It's called the bait and switch.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's called the Better Business Bureau. 
[01:33:00]  I did.  I found a complaint.  I wanted to dehumanize this one girl, and they sent another girl for me to dehumanize.  You're a jerk.  No, but I was very nice.  I've actually taken a few that I didn't want.  Oh, speaking of which, here's something.  You know, I actually, late at night, I actually ordered something against every principle.  What are you doing?  I ordered the Sham Wow.  What's the Sham Wow?  I swear to God.  That's the biggest.  I don't know what that is.  You know what?  Dude, but he took this, he takes this face cloth, he sticks it in an aquarium, and all the 
[01:33:30]  water goes away, and then he wrings it out of the sink, and the fish are coming out.  It was incredible.  Dude.  I'm like, and he's like, you know what he got me?  He goes, you'll never have to buy paper towels again.  And I'm like, that's good for the environment.  I'm getting one of these, right?  First of all, I was on the phone for like three hours.  Yeah, what did you also sign up for?  CDs and a George Foreman grill?  I couldn't get out.  I finally had to hang up.  And, dude, I came in.  Dude, they're possibly worse than paper towels.  Dude, it's called a Sham. 
[01:34:00]  What did you expect?  What a Sham.  Wow.  This guy.  And wow is for.  Wow, someone bought this.  I've watched this infomercial.  My favorite part is like, you know, and the Germans make it.  You know, Germans always make good stuff.  Do they?  Yeah.  Cars.  Cars.  In the 30s.  Rockets.  Yeah.  I watched this infomercial.  Look, he pours soda on this piece of carpet.  A lot of it.  Watch for the edit.  Then look.  Yeah, watch the edit.  Look, it's dripping through this carpet.  Then he takes the Sham.  Wow.  And he placed it on top.  Now look, there's no soda coming out of the bottom anymore, by the way. 
[01:34:30]  He rolls it up.  Look how much just came out, because it was already full of soda.  Oh, I fell for this hook, line, and sinker.  And now look.  Wait.  Now look.  He pats it really hard, lifts up the carpet.  Look, it's dry.  How did they not catch that?  It's a horrible edit.  Dude, it's a horrid edit.  And how come the table's not wet anymore?  Nothing.  It soaks it up like crazy.  Because it's the Sham.  Wow.  Look at all these white trash losers, and I actually bought this.  They went to like a county fair where the Sham Wow stand was set up, 
[01:35:00]  and interviewed these fat, white, trash idiots, who are these rubes, if you will.  Are you lonely in there, though?  Bill's a rub.  I don't know what happened.  Give me your number.  I'll call you.  But I continue to use it, and every time I use it, I'm cursing my brains out.  Sir, sir, why don't you come up here?  I have this fine elixir for you, right off the wagon.  Your ancestors were in front of the snake oil salesman buying this elixir.  Who's that guy from Green Acres?  Genuine.  Mr. Haney.  Hey, well, let me tell you, I got the Sham Wow. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, Mr. Haney.  Mr. Douglas, it'll clean up anything.  The Sham Wow.  I bought that, what did I buy?  I bought that set it and forget it thing, which was great.  Everything is set it and forget it.  Showtime grill.  Showtime grill.  Oh, is that the one where you go, set it, and the audience goes, and forget it.  Turn on an oven and just walk away.  Yeah, forget about it.  Just forget it.  Just forget about it, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Next thing is the firemen at your house hosing it down.  You know, I'm supposed to forget it totally.  Yeah, but there's a thing.  That thing was great.  Really?  It worked?  It was great, yeah.  That thing totally worked, but the Sham Wow.  What happened with the Sham Wow?  I might as well be wiping up water with this plastic bag.  That's about how good it is.  You just move it around.  Dude, I'm on a hardwood floor, and I can't get it all up.  When did it sink in that, oh, my God, I was ripped off?  The second I got in, it smells bad. 
[01:36:30]  The whole thing, but I continue to use it because...  Were you so excited when the package came in the mail, like, oh, my Sham Wow is here?  Oh, I was literally expecting it.  I was going to go stick it in the toilet to do a demonstration.  See how much it absorbs.  Yeah, check this out.  Just wring it out to the top of the toilet.  And you did this to conserve, to not waste paper towels.  Yeah, and what I did was actually, you know, those things are probably not even biodegradable.  Oh, sure.  You know, and this is a great scam, too, because I guess you can return it a month in if you don't like it.  Use it, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  But the genius is, is that 1995, am I really going to go through the problems of repackaging this and sending it back to Germany?  That's what they're banking on, that you're never going to return something that's so cheap you're just going to take your hand.  I might as well use notebook paper.  It's that bad.  It's horrible.  Wow, Sham.  If you want to save paper towels, just be neater.  Bill, what's wrong with you?  Just don't be such a mess.  Let me tell you.  I have a really bad habit of setting glasses of water down on the floor, and it can literally be 90 feet away from me, 
[01:37:30]  and somehow I will forget, and I will, I just kick it across the room.  The other day, here's how eco-friendly I am.  The other day, I'm reaching into the fridge for a beer, of course, and it falls out of the fridge and smashes on the floor in front of the refrigerator.  I calmly grabbed a full roll of paper towels, and by the end, I had a cardboard tube and a giant pile of beer-soaked and glass-embedded paper towels 
[01:38:00]  that I just picked up and threw in the garbage, and everything was fine.  It was an entire roll, brand new, from the plastic to the cardboard tube, because I don't care.  I know.  I'm not getting a ShamWow.  I don't mind you.  At least you're conscious of the fact.  I'm not getting one.  You're wearing one on your head.  My ShamWow on my head. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that's good.  I should get one.  Keep it soaked in water.  Water my follicles.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  Hey, we're back.  If you're just tuning in, we're back here with the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Bill Burr, and I'll tell you, this weather, this summer weather has just been fantastic,  and it's too bad the dollar collapsed and that we now are combined with Mexico. 
[01:39:00]  But it's all good, because we've got the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony, so keep it here.  All right, so this next clip is a story that I told, evidently sometime in 2007.  Is that what I did?  E-Rock?  I think so.  Even though you're not supposed to be here, because this is just supposed to be me hosting  this.  And it was about the time I was down doing this gig in Washington, D.C.  And it was about six months after 9-11, and I wanted, you know, a plane crashed into the 
[01:39:30]  Pentagon, and I wanted to go down there and see it.  And for some stupid fucking reason, I thought the Pentagon was like going to the Jefferson  Memorial.  I thought it was a tourist attraction, rather than the Hall of Justice.  So, and I don't know, that's the setup, and hilarity ensued.  So enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  Washington is a great, great town.  Yeah.  A lot of culture. 
[01:40:00]  I'm going to the museums.  Are you really?  No.  I sit in my room like I always do and watch movies.  Ah, you gotta get out there.  No, you don't.  Experience the culture.  Ah, no.  No?  You never do.  I remember that time I went down there, and I went to the Pentagon, because I thought it  was like the Lincoln Memorial, that you could just walk around and look at it.  So I started walking around the thing.  Oh, I bet you were stopped.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, funny.  I was like looking in a Jeep, so I go, this is cool.  I'm just walking around all of a sudden. 
[01:40:30]  What are you doing?  Well, it was right after, it was.  Don't say right after 9-11.  No, it was.  You will be.  It was six months after 9-11.  Oh, good one.  And they never really showed the footage where it hit, so I was just like, oh, I don't  want to see this.  Yeah.  You know, so I started, you know, there was some people in uniform, other people wearing  like suits, so I don't know, it just didn't dawn on me, and I just started walking around,  looked at a couple of Jeeps, and then I just started, and all of a sudden this Jeep  came flying out, and this guy gets out with like this red beret, and he's like smiling, 
[01:41:00]  but he's looking right through to the back of my skull.  He's like, hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  He goes, what are you doing?  And I was just like, oh, you know, I'm just sort of, just kind of walking around, and  the guy goes, oh, yeah?  That's not what I heard.  And I was like, uh-oh.  That's not what I heard?  Oh, no.  He goes, that's not how I heard it.  He goes, I heard you were walking around looking in Jeeps, acting suspicious, and the reality  was I was like, I wonder where the plane hit. 
[01:41:30]  Do I walk around this way, or do I walk around that way?  So I kind of did like a back and forth thing, and I was looking in Jeeps.  Oh, looking suspicious.  Oh, it was brutal, so I had to be like, and I couldn't say why I was there, you know?  Did they haul you in?  No, they just, they started asking me questions, and I just said, look, I'm a comedian.  I'm in town.  I was working at this place, Teddy's House of Comedy.  Down there.  Teddy's House of Comedy.  Welcome to Teddy's House of Comedy. 
[01:42:00]  That's what I don't understand about comedy clubs.  That's where my career was.  That's where my career was.  But I don't understand these comedy club owners.  They can't come up with better names for their clubs.  Oh, they're terrible.  Teddy's House of Comedy.  That's not even a bad one.  Laughter Hours.  Oh, Laughter Hours.  Like New York Post headlines.  Yeah.  What is the name of it?  Puns.  All right, anyway, I don't want to get you off track, so what happened?  So he just ends up taking down my name and whatever, starting some sort of file, I guess.  Oh, no.  And then I go, look, man, I didn't realize that this, now I'm really starting to think like, 
[01:42:30]  yeah, dude, this isn't a tourist attraction.  This is where they plot out.  Yeah, wars.  This is where they plot out world domination.  Covert actions.  Yeah, like I was going to take a tour of it.  I'm an idiot.  And you're peeking.  You were peeking into things.  I was looking at the Jeeps like it was an exhibit.  But I'm surprised I didn't get in one and start, you know, pretending I was driving.  This is great.  Can someone take my picture?  Yeah.  And, oh, perfect.  Just, you know, white male, mid-30s. 
[01:43:00]  I mean, I just had everything that they were looking for.  I was a psycho.  Some wacky militia guy.  So then I go, look, man, I was walking around looking at it.  I go, all right, I'll leave.  And the guy goes, no, he's like, you're free to walk around the whole thing if you want.  And at that point, I was so freaked out.  I was like, no, dude, I'm like that.  And I walked away, and I was kind of laughing.  And then one on the Marine all of a sudden just kind of yelled out.  And he was trying to, like, scare me or whatever.  And I was just, ah, you know.  He did that for his buddies.  Like, watch this, watch this. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, you think the football players didn't do that in high school?  I didn't have a noise.  No, my problem with Washington, D.C. is I'll go in front of the White House every time I go down there.  And I get this urge to, I'm not even kidding, to climb the fence to see what happens.  Well, that happens every so often.  I know.  But I get that feeling like, ah, why don't we just see what happens?  Same end result.  You get tackled on the lawn.  Hopefully you get tackled and not shot.  Oh, yeah.  Pre-9-11, that was a wacky frat stunt. 
[01:44:00]  Right, right, right.  I hear what Opie did.  See how far you get, man.  Yeah.  Where you get tackled by secret service.  Dude, I think I can make it to the front door.  Yeah, sure.  And all you got was, like, community service back then.  Yeah.  Now it's like you get.  Prison, torture, Guantanamo.  But what is that?  We all have it in our brains.  Like, you know, I get the urge to do that.  But I don't.  Like, I used to watch, come into the city from Long Island and go see a lot of talk shows with my mom and my family.  Like, back in the day, Phil Donahue and Montel and the rest of them. 
[01:44:30]  Sally Jessie.  Whatever.  Whatever they were giving free tickets out for.  And I would sit in the audience and get the urge to just run onto the stage and tackle the host.  And then I'm like, oh, my God, is anyone reading my brain?  Do they realize what I'm thinking of doing right now?  Like, I get all freaked out.  And then I'm like, all right, calm down.  No one knows.  No one knows.  Just enjoy this.  Like, crazy people do it.  Right.  That's the difference.  But you just think about it.  You think about it.  But for some reason, you don't. 
[01:45:00]  That's like when you.  I think it's the same mentality like when you were in class and the teacher's like, the next person who laughs.  And then immediately you're just holding your nose.  Yeah.  Trying not to laugh.  Anything.  Even to this day, if someone said.  You walk into a store and they'll have something there that says, please do not touch.  You just have to go.  I want to touch it.  You just got to take one finger and just poke at it.  Yeah.  Don't tell me what to do the second I come in your store.  Crazy people do those things.  That's why they're crazy. 
[01:45:30]  Like, they think about it and just do it.  And don't give it a second thought.  And then they get dragged off.  Yeah.  But sane people, you still think it.  But you just know, well, I can't do that.  And I'll be thrown in jail.  You'd think about the consequences of it.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Bill Burr.  If you're just tuning in, we're back here with the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Bill Burr.  I love how I'm looking back on it.  It's literally five years and I feel like I'm on Johnny Carson right now.  Like, I actually have 40 years of incredible radio. 
[01:46:00]  So, enjoy this one.  How is that for an awful ending?  Well, I'm not getting paid, so I don't give a fuck.  Broadcasting.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Bill Burr.  And we got Bill Burr in studio.  Hello.  And he's very excited because Bret Michaels is coming in in about 20, 25 minutes.  And you're a big fan of Rock and Love.  Oh, great show.  Are you a fan because you think it's a great show or because it's kind of like a train wreck?  I'm a fan because of how they started off the show.  Out of all the humiliating things I've seen on reality television, 
[01:46:30]  they basically get, you know, it's basically Flavor of Love.  Flavor of Love for white guys.  Right.  For the white audience.  They get 25 white whores this time, right?  They have them out in the driveway.  And, you know, Bret comes up in his yellow motorcycle.  They're all going crazy.  I got a friend.  Right there, I think the show is ridiculous.  They're going crazy over Bret Michaels.  I mean, back in the day, I understand he was with Pam and everybody else, but come on.  Jesus, come here, dude. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, come on.  If you saw these girls.  That's not reality.  If you saw these girls, though, they all look like the hottest girl at, like, Denny's.  I mean, retired stripper-looking girls, they're horrific, right?  So he pulls up.  Everybody goes crazy.  And then he walks in the house and his big bouncer guy stands there and he's looking at them, welcoming them all.  And all of a sudden he just starts calling off names.  Called off like, he picks one girl, then picks another girl.  By the time he got to the third girl, I'm saying to my girlfriend, going, they're going to kick these girls out before they even get in the house. 
[01:47:30]  Exactly.  They pick five of them.  And all the other whores are going like, why am I not picking me, right?  They get done picking five of these girls and they're hideous.  They look like, oh, like, they're just awful looking.  And they tell the other girls to go in the house and then they tell those five girls, basically, you're too ugly to even get into the house on a horrific reality show. 
[01:48:00]  That was awesome.  Did they talk to him later?  I'm very disappointed.  Well, there was one girl who just, like, all of them, yeah, they're all just like, I'm embarrassed.  I came all the way from Iowa, like, from horrific states, right?  The bus from Oklahoma City was 72 hours just to get to Utah.  I deserved more, right?  But one girl just refused to leave. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  She was just the whore that wouldn't quit, right?  So she comes back, you know, and just starts pounding on the door.  And then they just had to let her in.  And, I mean, she looked like she was every bit of 47.  Oh, my God.  Was that Tiffany?  That was the girl who kept going, don't threaten me with a good time.  Oh, Tiffany.  We got that clip, actually.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  That was her catchphrase.  They did a montage last night.  I don't know if it was on last night.  I have it on DVR or whatever.  But the episode I saw, they did a montage of her saying that over and over again. 
[01:49:00]  And when she says it is basically when someone's telling her to get her life together, someone's criticizing her.  Someone's trying to give her some real good advice, and that's what she said.  Yeah.  If you don't shape up, we're kicking you out of the house.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  If you don't get off drugs, we're taking away your children.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  Dude, she was a mess.  It's the catchphrase of the summer, though.  Oh, it's fantastic.  We got the clip of Tiffany trying to get back in the house after she was deemed too ugly to be in the house, right? 
[01:49:30]  Basically.  Big Don, he called out five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  By the way, Bill, thanks for the huge setup.  Oh, no problem.  Wow, really?  We just happened to have this clip.  Five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  I didn't come all the way from Chicago to be eliminated before I even walked in the door.  My name is Tiffany.  Hi, Tiffany.  You caught me, and I was wondering why.  Listen, it's nothing personal.  This is physical.  If it was up to Brett, he wouldn't have dismissed me.  No, Brett, if it was up to Brett, the entire city of L.A. would be here. 
[01:50:00]  But I'm a big fan of his.  I had a hat made.  I came here all the way from Chicago.  There's literally nowhere for you to sleep.  I'll sleep on the floor.  Please.  Please, I'm begging you.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I don't care.  I had a hat made.  I'll do anything.  Anything.  The music, Max.  He finally said yeah, and I jumped up, hugged him, and I didn't let go. 
[01:50:30]  It's meant to be.  Oh, man.  What did you have made?  A hat?  Yeah.  I can't hear.  I had a hat made.  Tara Reade's older sister.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll do anything.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  You have to stop smoking crystal meth first.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  I'll tell you, Matt, if she did four more episodes, she could have sold a million of  those t-shirts.  It was just, it really was going to, like you said, it was going to be the catchphrase 
[01:51:00]  of the summer.  Oh, my God.  Well, then she gets let back in the house, and this is what she does immediately.  I'm Tiffany.  I'm an alcoholic.  Yeah.  Tiffany, she got completely bombed.  I was just sitting back watching, like, holy ****.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, ****.  Ain't no booty like a self-side booty.  Oh.  Ain't there's no bad enough to step front of my face.  I got here this long.  I'm not going to, like, go home now.  Brett will keep me around. 
[01:51:30]  Just an old, drunk broad.  Is that what she is?  This is what is not doing justice.  She's like one of those girls who's old, but she's kept herself in shape.  Right.  So from the neck down, she could be 32, but you look at her face.  She's just a lizard.  She's closer to 50.  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, Jesus.  Tammy Faye.  Yesterday.  You know what?  It's a good show.  I mean, yesterday I was watching.  They had to do phone sex because if Bret Michaels is on the road. 
[01:52:00]  Did you see that episode yet?  Oh, it was great.  I'm telling you, it's a great show.  You know, Bret's girl's got to, like, you know, help him out if he's on the road and she's back home.  Yeah, sure.  So they had all these girls, like, dressing their hottest, like, lingerie and lay on this, like, you know, this, like, heart-shaped type bed and do phone sex and he's in another room.  And they hooked up something.  Did they hook it up to his?  Yeah, they actually hooked something up to his unit.  Yeah.  To see if he would get aroused.  Yeah.  And if you were terrible at it, they would just flatline.  The best part was Bret would get halfway through. 
[01:52:30]  If they stunk, he just hung up on them.  Dude, I'm telling you.  They got some great bits on this show.  One girl just started just giving phone sex and everyone else was, like, horrified, like, whoa, man, it's just a fun little show we're trying to participate in.  And she's like, I'll suck your beep.  Her whole segment was beeped out.  That was the weird thing.  It's your beep in my beep.  All the other girls are watching. 
[01:53:00]  So it kind of made it awkward.  But there were some girls that were just so bad at it.  They were just like, I just really want to spend time with you.  I just, you know, I just think you're interesting.  And it's just like, lady, what is this supposed to do for this guy?  This guy's a rock star.  He's probably had an 18 on one.  18 on one.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God, Bret.  Let me tell you what I'll do.  I will take your entire beep into my beep and then beep until you beep all over my beep. 
[01:53:30]  And if you want to put it beep, feel free.  I don't mind.  And I've done it before.  Bret, if me staying in the house takes you putting it beep, I will do that.  I've never done that sober.  But I'll probably do it for you.  And I'll even wash beep because my beep is probably really filthy.  But for you, I'll do anything. 
[01:54:00]  I'll let you go from beep to my beep.  And that's really sick.  That's disgusting.  A lot of girls won't do that.  A lot of girls wouldn't let you put beep.  We need a fart monitor.  But I would let you do that right there.  And I will beep until you beep.  And then if you want to put it beep, I'll even do that.  I don't care.  Do you have a dog?  If you have a dog and some peanut butter, I will beep the peanut butter on beep. 
[01:54:30]  And then I'll let the dog beep.  And you can watch.  I'll even let the dog beep me.  All over my, on my.  And the dog could, I don't even care.  Even the dog could, uh, could beep my beep.  Because I don't care.  And that's really dirty.  But for you, I'll do it.  We got one more Tiffany clip worth playing. 
[01:55:00]  You love me, beep.  Love you, beep.  She's a sloppy mess.  And, uh, it's pretty funny.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  That's not a nice word.  Oh, yeah, it is.  It's not a nice word.  You can't go throwing words like that around.  Hey, now, now.  Simmer down, now.  Simmer down.  No, you simmer down.  Simmer down.  I know this one's faded.  No, no, no, no.  You totally hate.  We're just having a good time. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, that needed a setup, obviously.  Tiffany calls one of the two black girls in the house an effing C-word.  Oh, yeah.  She was dropping it.  Dropping it like it was not that.  Why would they boot her?  Yeah, right.  Did they boot her yet?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they boot.  Yeah, she was.  Yeah, that's where they're just so stupid with these shows.  You would like that the black...  You keep her as long as you possibly can.  You know, they did it with Sanjaya.  Loose cannon.  You keep these people.  It makes it interesting.  It would have been good because the black girl on the show is hilarious.  She wore like a...  There's a clip on CW11. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, there it is.  Of a clip of the show.  Yeah, well, I think he's on CW11 right now.  And then he's heading over here.  Yeah, there he is.  It's still 1988, dude.  I was going to say, don't talk about him, but he's on there, so he can't listen to us right now.  He looks good, though, man.  I got to say, he doesn't look much different than he did a few years ago.  Wow.  I mean, they showed him in, like, pajamas without all that stuff.  Like, the headband stuff.  Oh, that was bad.  Oh, my God.  That was bad.  He looked like a circus clown out of his makeup. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  It was bad, dude.  He's had some stuff done on his face.  Wow, there's chicks, like, pushing each other and stuff.  No, that black girl's hilarious.  The other girl there is, like, she's really into animals, like PETA, and the black girl had a fur coat.  And she goes, I hate animals.  She goes, they're for food and clothing.  And she goes, how can you say that?  She goes, if there was an animal in here right now, I'd slit its throat.  Just, I swear to God, just to piss her off.  And she totally took the bait.  That was great.  On last night's episode, two girls went at it after the phone sex thing. 
[01:57:00]  And they're upstairs, and one girl has, like, I think the girl calls them circus boobs.  Yeah.  She's got implants that are so massive, and they're really high up, like, way higher than they're supposed to be.  And they just are.  Bizarre.  They're massive.  And she calls them circus boobs.  They are a little freakish look.  She looks like she has an ass on her chest.  So the one girl thought she was going to be cocky and started making fun of her circus boobs.  So the circus boob girl goes, oh, yeah, and just starts making fun of her face.  And it turns out the girl that has the kind of the face is a little off is because she was in a car accident. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, she started, like, the little fight, and then circus boob goes, well, look at your awful face.  And she's like, but that was from a car accident.  Oh, yeah.  Like, you went too far with this.  And she started complaining to Brett saying it's like a disability.  Would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair?  Right.  But she was the one.  You know how it goes. 
[01:58:00]  If you're going to fight, you're going to, you know, you're going to break out all the weapons.  Wow.  That's not fair.  I was in a car accident.  Yeah.  If your face went through a windshield, you probably couldn't start snapping on somebody.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be talking about someone's circus boobs.  They just showed a motorcycle accident, a little motocross, a little crash one of those girls took, face planted.  It was pretty good.  So they just put these whores in interesting little contests and competitions.  Dude, they're all whores.  They're all trying to act like they're not whores, but they have a stripper pole in there. 
[01:58:30]  And then the second they got drunk, all of them were doing those you need whore abs stripper moves on the pole.  You know, you got your legs straight out.  And it's like the only people who can do that are strippers.  Yeah.  I didn't want to like the show, but I like it.  Yeah.  VH1 knows what they're doing with this celebrity reality crap.  I was telling Jim last night at the Cellar, like we were talking about, you know, the reality TV and game shows.  There has never been a better time in Hollywood to be a has-been than it is right now. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  You're right.  You have a better shot at getting a TV show than I think.  Than anyone else.  Somebody brand new.  Scott Baio.  I just want to punch him in the face.  Have you seen that show?  The two Corys.  The two Corys.  They were in here yesterday.  The two Corys, yeah.  But my thing is, what is the cutoff line where even like you're too old?  I think it's like 75.  I would say like Tony Dow isn't getting a reality show.  He was the older brother on Leave It to Beaver.  But then when you get to that old, then you have to herd the has-beens. 
[01:59:30]  You got to put them all in a house.  In a surreal house, yeah.  Yeah, after 1970.  Like the My Three Sons guys.  The My Three Sons sons.  You could get one of them.  Yeah.  And he just sat there crying how there was no residuals.  Anyone from Gilligan's Island, do you think?  It'd have to be one of the women.  Yeah, Marianne or Ginger.  Ginger, yeah.  Yeah, they could probably do it.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to like change gears a little bit here. 
[02:00:00]  How to Dial a Rotary Phone.  We teased this before the break.  Ah, speaking of the olden days.  Nice segue.  Well, you know.  Speaking of Juan Epstein.  Sometimes you just jam on the brakes.  Well, they could do that.  The Welcome Back Cotter people would definitely be.  Yeah.  Because they had Horshack in the fights.  Remember that?  And that celebrity boxing.  They've just been through all these and they gather up the has-beens to beat each other up.  And Horshack got beat up by Screech, right?  Yeah.  I'd love to be a has-beens agent just to hear the offers that come in. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, it's got to be just hysterical.  VH1 wants you for Celebrity Toe Jam.  Race to the bottom of the Grand Canyon with the cast from Family Affair.  Just these horrific shows.  It's heading that way.  They're going to get worse and worse.  It is VH1, I think, that started all that stuff, too.  They're the ones we first came up with.  Yeah, yeah.  They're brilliant, man.  Well, they came up with the concept of celebrity reality.  Yeah, they took the reality show thing. 
[02:01:00]  The celebrities involved with the reality shows, making it cool.  Because when reality shows first hit, no celebrity would be caught dead doing it.  It's like, oh, that's hack stuff.  Those are people that just can't make it legitimately.  Yeah.  But then somehow VH1 talked them into like, oh, that's good.  Well, they don't get the big celebrities.  They get the has-beens, which is hysterical.  Watching these people living together.  Yeah, but see where it's going, though?  It's going to be legitimate stars are going to sign on for this as their next project. 
[02:01:30]  You watch.  That mini-me guy, he was the quickest has-been ever.  He was just like the, you know.  Yeah.  They were still in post-production.  Yeah.  And he was naked on that little scooter peeing in the corner.  Yeah.  One of the greatest moments ever, by the way.  And he was huge.  Like when the movies came out, the Austin Powers movies, like people were quoting things from the movie.  I remember page six, he was in scores and he had little leather pants. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  And he was the toast of the town from Monday to Wednesday.  And then he's-  There he is.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh my God.  How do you make a comeback from that?  How can you classify that as a person?  No.  What about when he started going...  Do we have that clip? 
[02:02:30]  Do we have all the clips?  Yeah.  If you're laying there dreaming about a fire, you think there's a fire engine going...  What a mess.  But he was, he was, you know, a big star.  He is, surely.  Even when he's sleeping, he doesn't even look peaceful.  Completely naked on a scooter, gets off and just takes a leak in a closet.  And he was in all the Austin Powers movies.  That's great.  This next clip is called Top Gun Sucked. 
[02:03:00]  And I've got to be honest with you, I read a description of this,  and I have absolutely no recollection of ever having this conversation.  So I'll be listening to this right along with you,  because my memory is failing me, and I think it's because of my cell phone,  or maybe it's because of the government spraying the chemtrails.  I don't know what the fuck it is, but I'm going to listen to this one right along with you.  You weren't in it.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  That's why you don't know it.  Oh, okay.  Should I put that in?  It'll be funny if you just leave that.  I'll leave it like that.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr. 
[02:03:30]  More montages, Top Gun, yes.  One of the greatest montages ever, probably.  Footloose.  Weird Science had that montage, I don't remember.  Nothing better in Top Gun than that fucking volleyball game.  Gets me every time, sends shivers down my cock.  That's what I was getting at, you know.  That's why it was a terrific montage.  Nothing but topless men.  Homo erotic, entoweled men in locker rooms.  That is the gayest movie ever fucking made.  Under the guise of not being gay. 
[02:04:00]  Of being manly.  Right.  They're all on a carrier, just in towels, smacking each other around, verbally abusing  each other.  See, we got to do our own list.  Like, it was fighter jet pilots.  Why would you play this and not Danger Zone?  On a carrier.  On a carrier.  A volleyball scene.  Wow.  And all that stuff was supposed to hide the gay undertones.  The complete gayness.  Right.  It's like, yeah.  How do you know that you're getting close? 
[02:04:30]  Because I'm getting hard.  It's like, these are guys talking.  Yeah.  How do you know, like, the MIG's getting close?  Because I'm getting hard, man.  Can't you feel it?  In your hand?  Is that a corny movie?  Ugh!  I haven't seen it in years.  The corniest.  I don't remember.  When it first came out, I was sitting in the movie theater watching that, thinking,  this is the coolest movie ever made.  It's like, from the opening scene.  The opening scene, while the credits are going, yeah.  There's the volleyball scene.  Thank you, Danny, for popping it up on the screen. 
[02:05:00]  Look, all the guys watching the volleyball game have to be topless, too.  They're all topless, too, because it's hot out.  Hey, what was wrong with what's his name's body that he's the only one with a shirt on,  by the way?  Anthony Edwards?  Goose?  He's got something going on, because he's the only guy wearing a shirt.  Goose didn't want to take his shirt off.  He must have a third nipple or something.  All right.  Goose had a vagina in the middle of his chest.  Yeah!  Look at them all.  They're high-fiving each other.  They're oiled up.  Gay!  Oh, look at that!  Look, he's got his arm around Maverick. 
[02:05:30]  What's that move?  Val Chilmer.  Yeah!  Oh, yeah.  You served that ball.  Oh, wow.  Look at Anthony Edwards.  What a dork.  Oh, a diving into the sand shot.  What a worthless scene this is.  It's the volleyball scene, bro.  This was trying to get the chicks to come to a fucking fighter plane movie.  Are you sure?  I don't know what it was.  And the gay men.  I don't think I like airplane movies. 
[02:06:00]  No, you've got to see the volleyball scene.  Oh, the volleyball scene.  You've got to question this Anthony Edwards.  What was wrong with his body?  Yeah, why didn't he want to take his shirt off?  He's the only one.  He probably had little cocks on his stomach.  Second genital joke in a row.  Yeah.  Predictable hack I am.  Fucking one-trick pony.  Yeah.  Look how long it takes Tom Cruise to put his T-shirt on.  Get that shirt on.  He's like, I've got to go.  I've got to go.  Yeah, I've got to go and meet a girl.  Yeah.  I've got to ride my motorcycle by the airfield. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And wave my fist.  My fist in victory.  At fucking fighters.  Right.  Somebody recut, they took all of the most gay portions of this movie and just put it  together into like four minutes.  Oh, nice.  It's the whole movie.  It's everything but the planes.  Everything but the credits and the gaffers, man.  There really is a lot of parts to this movie where you're just like, what the hell?  What the hell?  I'm going to buy it and watch it again.  It really is a corny movie.  It's so bad.  It's so corny and bad and cliche and gay and it's just really bad. 
[02:07:00]  And like I said, when I first saw it, like the opening sequence, you know, the sun's  coming up over the carrier deck and then they start flight ops and it's just the coolest  fucking thing.  You're sitting there going, holy shit, this is going to be a great movie.  Fighter, jets and then it just turns gay.  It turns gay and fucking corny as hell.  Who is the bitch today?  Kelly McGillis.  Who, um, not hot.  And the song was Take My Breath Away, right?  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  That was in there every time, every time they were together. 
[02:07:30]  It's a good song.  There it is.  Who doesn't like this?  Take my breath away.  This was Berlin?  It sure was.  I did a fucking TV show with her.  No, you didn't.  I did with the woman in Berlin, me, her and Coolio.  Really?  Yeah.  Congrats.  No, it was Never Mind the Buzzcocks, hosted by Marc Maron.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Congrats again.  A little bit of trivia.  You keep that under your hats, ladies and germs.  Top Gun Homosexuality. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, uh.  What is that, Quentin?  Yeah, he starts off, the video that I was talking about starts off with him explaining  why Top Gun is the gayest movie of all time.  And what movie is that from that he's explaining?  You know, I don't know.  Oh, let's hear this.  I do remember.  Hang on, hang on.  Let me start it from the beginning.  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  What's the film about?  What's it really about?  What genre does it take?  What, what, like, it's like a, like a spine?  The spine?  Like one sentence?  No, I don't fucking Boy Meets Girl.  I don't give a shit about that.  Fuck Boy Meets Girl.  Fuck Motorcycle Movie.  No, what is really being said?  What's really being seen? 
[02:08:30]  That's what you're talking about.  Because the whole idea, man, is subversion.  You want subversion on a massive level.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood  is?  What?  Top Gun.  Oh, come on.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  You think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah, it's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.  It is a story about a man who's struggled with his own homosexuality.  That's it.  That is what Top Gun is about, man.  You've got Maverick, all right? 
[02:09:00]  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line, all right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  They represent the gay man, all right?  And they're saying, go, go the gay way, go the gay way.  He'd go both ways.  What about Kelly McGillis, right?  Kelly McGillis, she's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  They're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way, all right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie.  He goes to her house, right?  All right?  It looks like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything. 
[02:09:30]  They don't have sex.  He gets in the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here?  Next scene.  Next scene, you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy.  She's got the cap on.  She's got the aviator clashes.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears.  She goes, okay, this is how I got to get this guy.  This guy's going to the gay way.  I got to bring him back.  I got to bring him back from the gay way.  So I'm going to do that through centrifuge.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right?  That is how she approaches it.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  But the real ending of the movie is when they fight the mids at the end. 
[02:10:00]  All right?  Because he has passed over into the gay way.  They are this gay fighting fucking force.  All right?  And they're beating the Russians.  The gays are beating the Russians.  All right?  And it's over, and they fucking land.  And Iceman is trying to get Maverick the entire time.  Finally, he's got him.  All right?  And what is the last fucking line that they had together at all?  Hugging and kissing and happy with each other.  And Ice comes up to Maverick, and he says, man, you can ride my tails any time.  And what does Maverick say?  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight. 
[02:10:30]  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  That's fucking it, man.  I fucking love Quentin Tarantino.  Brilliant.  Quentin Tarantino, man.  The gay way.  And a little Dane Cook deliverance.  I love that.  It's like, and here's Iceman and his crew, and they're all gay.  And they're gay.  What really makes that clip, though, is the cuts to the movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The cuts to the movie as he's talking.  Again, if they go on YouTube and just put in Top Gun homosexuality, you'll get the movie and then this. 
[02:11:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's The Worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr.  All right, so evidently the reason why I didn't remember having that conversation is because I never fucking had it because I wasn't in that day.  All right, so this is going to be the second half of, I guess, Anthony and Jim Norton talking about how Top Gun sucks.  And Anthony's going to explain some Air Force terminology to the great little Jimmy Norton.  Broadcasting The Worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Bill Burr. 
[02:11:30]  In honor of the Top Gun discussion that just went down during the break.  Yeah.  It wasn't a discussion.  We all just blew each other.  Trying to be just like the movie.  So, Ant said that he watched Top Gun.  Uh-uh!  Uh-uh!  What?  Could this be the Toot-o-dee-toot song of the day?  Oh.  No.  No, wait.  Let me sing.  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to be able to do it. 
[02:12:00]  Toot.  Toot-o-dee-doo.  Toot-o-do-dee-dee-doo.  Doot-o-do.  Yeah, apparently. 
[02:12:30]  We had a discussion recently about Top Gun and how gay it was.  And we pulled some clips and played them.  But we had to watch it.  So we were hanging out.  Danny was over the house and shit.  So we figured, let's just watch Top Gun and see really how fucking gay this is. 
[02:13:00]  So we took all our clothes off.  Lubed off.  And spooned as we watched Top Gun.  We were spooning.  It's not gay because you're watching Top Gun.  No, Top Gun.  Top Gun is gayer than anything that's going on.  In between two greased up naked men.  Danny called his dick Goose and he treated your asshole like the inside of a fucking plane.  Yes, my ass was the canopy.  And he slammed his head into it. 
[02:13:30]  And what do you bring to the program?  Well.  Movie more gay than you thought?  Yes.  It was so completely gay.  And not even just this gay stuff everyone kind of knows about.  The jaw clenching of Val Kilmer in the locker room when he's telling Tom Cruise how dangerous he is.  Maverick.  Yeah.  It's like this.  The whole speech he gives about how dangerous he is. 
[02:14:00]  And then Danny brings up a great point about that scene.  Maverick doesn't want to hear about how dangerous he is.  So what does he do?  I was going to say he turns.  He doesn't want to hear what Val Kilmer has to say.  So he turns completely away from him and kind of puts his foot up on the bench that I think Goose was sitting on.  And just kind of presents his fucking ass to him.  Yeah, he presents his ass like an ape would present to another ape to get fucked.  He's not just standing kind of like Captain Morgan-y. 
[02:14:30]  He's like actually bent over.  He's bent over and his ass is pointing.  Now he's twisted around a little bit.  Yeah.  And they're all in towels, by the way.  They're all in towels in the locker room where they have most of their real in-depth man-on-man discussions in the locker room.  You guys got to do Secret Show with this movie, I'm thinking.  Top Gun could be the one.  Could be the next Back to the Future movie.  Could be the next Secret Show, I'm thinking.  I mean, I haven't seen that movie in years.  I remember just the dumb stuff like the volleyball frequency. 
[02:15:00]  That's ultra gay.  Where everyone's topless except for what's his name?  Goose.  And rumor has it he had a third nipple or something or an appendix scar so he couldn't show off his manliness like the rest of the boys.  And people like to point out that particular scene when referencing Top Gun as being totally homoerotic and gay.  But what a lot of people miss about that particular scene is that he's late to get to Kelly McGillis' house where he knew he could have got some poontang.  He was late.  Right.  Because he wanted to finish playing with the boys. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, playing with the boys is playing.  Because that was more important to him than getting some ass off the fucking flight instructor.  This is the gayest song for one of the gayest scenes.  The volleyball.  Tweety-tweedly-doo.  Tweety-tweedly-doo.  I could play the whistle.  I just got to shove it up my ass first and blast some gas out into it.  Yeah, the volleyball scene is known as being gay.  But Goose does have his shirt off in the locker room at one point.  Oh, lucky us.  So I did get to see Anthony Edwards, who I think Anthony Edwards ran into a nuclear reactor right after the movie was done. 
[02:16:00]  Because he went from having a full head of hair in that movie to completely fucking bald.  I don't know what happened to that guy.  He didn't do well with all the gay sex that was going on behind the scenes.  Maybe not.  He actually had cancer after that.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Did not agree that he didn't.  And continue eating.  Yeah.  And let's not forget about where Maverick is all distraught over Goose's death. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  Because he feels guilt for it.  Yeah.  So he's looking at himself in the mirror, in like the barracks.  And Tom Skerritt decides this is going to be a great time to get in there and build his confidence up.  While Tom Cruise is naked, he's wearing a pair of tighty-whities.  Tidy-whities is all he's wearing.  He's completely nude, except for his tighty-whities.  Tom Skerritt comes up and starts telling him that this stuff happens when you're a fighter pilot.  And, you know, you're going to get losses like that.  And then, as he's walking away, he doesn't give him a pat on the shoulder. 
[02:17:00]  He takes his hand, Tom Skerritt, places it on Maverick's shoulder.  And then runs it slowly to his other shoulder, across his back and everything, as he walks away.  That arm swipe?  Yeah, it's like an arm swipe thing to a nude man in the bathroom.  And don't forget, when Meg Ryan, when they first meet in the movie, Meg Ryan and Tom Cruise, she goes,  Oh, Goose tells me that you're in love with one of your instructors.  Yes.  But that's it. 
[02:17:30]  It doesn't say which one.  It doesn't say which one.  And then they're talking about, you know, they're going over some briefing in their little briefing room.  And they're talking about, you know, MIGs and how you've got to get into position, a fire.  And one of the guys leans over to his flight partner there and goes,  This gives me such a hard-on.  He had to whisper it.  He whispered that to another guy?  To another man, his life partner in the cockpit. 
[02:18:00]  He's whispering.  Just one scene after another, we were laughing at every gay scene, and we were constantly laughing.  The movie doesn't have gay scenes in it.  It's constantly gay.  They pulled one over on us, you think, huh?  And then the famous line, you could ride my tail.  Yeah, well, he goes, you could be my wingman.  I'll tell you the truth.  He never said you could ride my tail, which I was waiting for, but it's, you could be my wingman.  Quentin Tarantino said that in his case, right?  Yeah, he gets it wrong.  Oh, he got it wrong?  He says, you could be my wingman any time.  He goes, you could be mine. 
[02:18:30]  It's just as gay.  Believe me, it's semantics.  It really is Tom Cruise's character.  He's overcompensating for being gay.  So he's in flight school.  He has to ride a motorcycle, the fastest production bike on the planet.  He has to ride that.  He has to fly a big fighter plane.  He's in love with Goose, too.  Absolutely.  He's in love with Goose.  The way he talks to him, I understand that there's going to be some kind of bond between the pilot and co-pilot,  but the way he talks to Goose, it was more like two men in a relationship than a team, than like two partners, like two team partners having a chat. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, like because Maverick was the Maverick, and he would always get them in trouble, and Goose would be like, you know, hey, dude, you know, I got responsibilities here.  I need to get through this and stuff, and you're screwing it up for me.  And they'd be like, I'm sorry.  It was like a, yeah, boyfriend and girlfriend chat.  It was like Maverick cheated on Goose.  He has to sympathize.  He goes like, I swear that it will never, I'll never do that again.  Yeah, I'll never do it again.  It will never happen again.  Goose.  And then he put his cock in his mouth and just like squeezed his balls a little. 
[02:19:30]  At that point, you got it.  That's right.  What else is there to do, you know?  His nickname was Goose because when he would fuck his ass like a Japanese businessman, he would choke his friend and his asshole clenches and death throws.  And he would say, God, you asshole grips my cock like a goose's would.  He said, I want that to be my nickname.  And that is, that goose, the act of goosing someone is like sticking something up their ass.  Yeah.  Which is a little odd.  Sure.  Maverick, the, you know, the Maverick kind of guy.  Well, Barry's reminding us of the bar scene. 
[02:20:00]  That's right.  Oh, yes.  With the boys with their arms around each other singing into a big black microphone.  What are they singing?  Great balls of fun.  Great balls of fun.  No, and they're in the bar when he's trying to pick up his beard, Kelly McGillis.  Oh, that one, too.  And they're singing.  You've lost that.  You lost that loving feeling.  And just, they're all wearing.  Boom, boom, boom.  Take my bro.  That's a good song.  And Tom Cruise, boy, can he not even hold a note.  No, a nut, he can hold two. 
[02:20:30]  In his mouth.  Yeah.  That shit monk.  And Kelly McGillis in the, dressed like a man in the elevator.  You know that scene where he walks in and she's got the cap on and the pilot jacket and stuff.  Completely homosexual movie.  Brother Joe wants to either plug a gig or talk about Top Gun.  You never know, Brother Joe.  Probably a little of both.  All right.  All right.  Brother Joe, what do you got, buddy?  Joe, a little Top Gun.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, boys.  How you guys doing? 
[02:21:00]  I want to see sloppy party bottom gun.  You know what?  Think about it.  Nobody can mention the fact that Tom Cruise's co-pilot's name was Goose.  Okay.  I just said that.  No, actually, wait, wait, wait.  He was Goose, right?  Yes.  And what does that mean?  Well, if you guys are talking about it being a homoerotic movie.  Yeah.  Goose is, if I'm not wrong, taking it up the ass. 
[02:21:30]  Is that not correct?  Holy shit.  Well, Goose is winning.  That's actually a pretty good observation.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  I just said that.  He hung up.  Shut the fuck up.  Of course he knows the show.  That's great.  He just.  Anthony had just said that.  He just said it.  His name's Goose.  Poor Joe.  I know.  Brian from St. Louis.  Go to what?  Some acknowledgement. 
[02:22:00]  Slider.  Of course, Slider.  Oh, yes.  Slider.  Yes.  Was sliding.  Where was he sliding off?  One of the guys.  Was that Iceman's?  Who was Iceman's Rio?  Iceman.  I don't know.  Iceman.  I don't know.  Can we play the Quentin Tarantino rap on this?  It's brilliant.  That one is really good.  Good capper for the homo, the gayest movie ever.  And, you know, it starts off so promising when you're just seeing like flight ops on the  carrier deck.  It's kind of like, okay, this is going to be a cool fucking movie. 
[02:22:30]  And then it just goes right to gay.  Here's the question, though.  Is this the gayest movie ever that wasn't supposed to be gay?  What year was it?  God damn it, Maverick.  How many times did...  I need some butts.  Give me some butts.  How many times did...  Fucking, what's his name from Back to the Future?  You forget it's him, too.  I know.  It's him.  You had me wrong because he's like, you know what your problem is, Maverick?  You're a slacker.  You're a slacker.  You're a slacker, Maverick. 
[02:23:00]  Father was a slacker.  And you're a slacker.  Yeah, because he did.  His father was a slacker.  But he wasn't.  You guys watched the movie together?  Yes, we did.  On a couch?  We watched it.  Well, I have a big L-shaped modular couch.  He was on one part of the L.  I was on the other.  Sure.  And our cocks met where...  I was going to say, so how did he make the awkward move to get all the way over on you?  Get over to me.  We wanted to play Top Gun while we were watching it.  I bet you they had one bowl of popcorn.  I sat behind him like the Rio.  Yeah, yeah.  He sat behind me. 
[02:23:30]  But it was cool because he was sitting behind me, but he put his heart on between my legs,  and I grabbed it like the stick, and I was working my airplane that way.  That's nice.  With Danny's cock as the stick.  He did a split S.  We got it.  We got it.  See, do you get it?  Yeah, we got it.  I've done that before.  It's not gay.  As long as you keep saying vroom.  Vroom.  Vroom.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  My boys love it.  Movie came out in 86.  I did a split ass.  The Quentin Tarantino.  Let's get to the rap by Quentin Tarantino. 
[02:24:00]  You got it right, Dirk?  Okay.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is?  What?  Top Gun.  Top Gun.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  Do you think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah, it's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.  It is a story about a man who struggled with his own homosexuality.  That's it.  That is what Top Gun is about, man.  You've got Maverick.  All right?  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line. 
[02:24:30]  All right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  And they represent the gay man.  Right.  All right?  And they're saying, go.  Go the gay way.  Go the gay way.  He could go both ways.  What about Kelly McGillis, Richard?  Kelly McGillis.  She's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  And they're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way.  All right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie.  What is this?  Goes to her house, right?  All right?  It looks like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything.  They don't have sex.  He gets on the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here? 
[02:25:00]  Next scene.  Next scene, you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy.  She's got the cap on.  She's got the aviator glasses.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears.  She goes, okay, this is how I got to get this guy.  This guy's going towards the gay way.  So I got to bring him back.  I got to bring him back from the gay way.  So I'm going to do that through subterfuge.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right?  That is how she approaches it.  Right.  All right?  But the real ending of the movie is when they fight the mids at the end.  All right?  Because he has passed over into the gay way.  Gay fighting fucking force. 
[02:25:30]  All right?  And they're beating the Russians.  The gays are beating the Russians.  All right?  And it's over.  And they fucking land.  And Iceman's been trying to get Maverick the entire time.  Finally, he's got him.  All right?  And what is the last fucking line that they had together all?  Hugging and kissing and happy with each other.  And Ice comes up to Maverick.  And he says, man, you can ride my tails in this time.  And what does Maverick say?  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  This in from Pat from Munahi texted me. 
[02:26:00]  He says, in one of the deleted scenes on the DVD, there's the scene where Maverick goes  into a meat spin.  Wasn't that a flat spin?  Yeah.  Meat spin.  Now I've got to go see the damn movie.  Yeah.  You've got to, like, get it.  It's on, you know, on demand or something.  We've got to get a list of our favorite movies.  And not the typical, oh, the Godfather.  Movies that weren't supposed to be what, you know what I mean?  Like, they're different to us and makes it hilarious. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  It was made either by, either too much time went by and they're dated now.  Well, like Twister's in there.  Like, I look at movies that I used to think were good and they are so bad.  Red Dawn is another one.  That's just an awful movie with all the fucking, you know, the Brat Packers and the Soviets  kind of invade us and big World War III on American soil.  Ew.  Patrick Swayze's in it. 
[02:27:00]  Tom Cruise is in it.  What does Patrick Swayze do?  Throw his pancreas at the enemy?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Dan listening on BCN in Boston.  I'm really proud of myself for that line.  Very good, Jimmy.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  The gayest scene in that movie you guys actually missed, it's right before they sing You Lost  That Love and Feeling, Sundown, the black guy, is actually pouring his drink into another  man's mouth. 
[02:27:30]  That did not happen.  I don't know.  I missed that.  But you know what, you reminded me of another instance in that scene where Goose is saying  he's making the bet with Maverick, and he goes, all right, so, you know, you have to get  some kind of sexual contact, and he goes, with a girl this time, and then fucking Maverick  makes a face at him, like, like, yeah, like something might have happened.  Yeah, like, yeah, like, like, yeah, that's right.  And we kind of laughed at that.  And called him out on it.  Yep.  It's packed with so much, so much, so much gay.  Gay.  Hey, that movie's queer. 
[02:28:00]  You know, watch it now.  And you know what, too?  It was the top grossing movie of the year, and it's so fucking predictable.  Like, Goose dies because they go into that flat spin, so of course, what's the big crescendo  of the fucking movie?  It's battle time, and what does Maverick do?  He fucking hits the jet wash and goes into a flat spin.  Another flat spin.  What is a jet wash?  Well, it's another jet's flying in front of you, and it kind of, you get into some unstable  air, so the engines aren't sucking in air, and you get a flame out, so your engines die. 
[02:28:30]  Is that what a flame out is?  Flame out, flame out.  A few things can cause a flame out.  How do you light the flame while you're up there in space?  Birds flying in there.  Wait, but how do you relight that shit?  You got to restart your engine.  Can you in a mid-flight, though?  Yeah.  You can?  Yeah.  As long as it's not damaged.  If a big fucking turkey flies in there, it's going to be fucked up, but if you're flame  out from unstable air, you can...  I don't even think people are really flaming out from unstable air, to tell you the truth. 
[02:29:00]  Can you on a commercial airline a relight the restart?  Yes.  Yeah, there have been instances where their engines have shut down, and they had to restart.  One guy actually shut the fucking engines off, one pilot.  By accident?  Yeah.  No, I think it was an on-purpose, I'm going to kill everybody on the plane thing.  Oh.  And, yeah, they subdued him.  And then somebody said, you daffy bastard, you can't do that.  Ah, you goofy guy.  I thought you had to have some kind of thrust to get lift.  I thought if you stop that, you start falling. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, the turbines are going to keep turning just from the air going through.  Not that fast, though, right?  If you go into a dive with a fucking commercial airliner, the things are going to spin like  a pinwheel.  Yeah, but then your wings rip off.  But also, you do have, you know, a starter.  You could start the thing.  It's not like some guy's cranking it on the ground with a fucking Model T crank.  But if you're plummeting...  Yeah.  ...your wings will rip off.  No, you wouldn't be plummeting.  You set up what is called a glide slope in a plane. 
[02:30:00]  You can set up where you glide a certain distance forward for every foot you fall.  You're going a certain amount of feet forward.  It's your optimum glide where you can get the most forward motion out of how far you're falling  straight down.  Is it a good glide slope if you go two feet forward, 1,600 feet down?  Hey, we got a fighter pilot on the phone.  I don't want this guy to go away. 
[02:30:30]  Rick in Oklahoma.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I was a pilot down there in Miramar when all those fucking faggots were down there  filming.  Were you?  And?  Yeah.  Uh, every day before filming, that fucking faggot Tom Cruise would want to see, uh, he'd  want to see every pilot out there in their flight suit so he could figure out which flight 
[02:31:00]  suit he wanted to wear that would make him look the best.  Looked cool.  But he was actually staring at all these pilots.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did you look hot?  In your flight suit?  Did you present?  Ooh.  Did you present to Tom?  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually did for Tom.  I went in his, uh, I went in his trailer and pulled out my hog and stuck in the fucking  air.  All right.  Get out of here.  He doesn't sound like much of a fighter pilot to me.  I'm calling shenanigans on him. 
[02:31:30]  Bravo, Sierra.  Yes.  Let's go to Pat in Texas.  Pat.  Bless you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, Pat.  Good evening.  Hey, Jimmy, you are a comedic god.  Oh, come on.  Don't be so fresh.  Thank you.  Um, you know, you guys have just completely and totally fucked up my childhood.  Why?  Why?  Loved that fucking movie as a kid.  Okay.  I even went so far enough to go out and buy it, get my parents to buy me a, you know,  an aviator jacket and sunglasses, you know, and I wanted to go into the Navy. 
[02:32:00]  But after hearing you guys say, I can never watch the fucking movie again.  So instead of going to the Navy, you went into the fashion industry instead?  Yeah.  I wanted to fly a plane, then I had these glasses, and now I'm in FIT.  Hey, I suck unclipped cod.  Let's go to Kyle on the interstate, interstate 78.  I want to say hi to all the truckers today.  We don't acknowledge you guys enough.  Hey, man.  What's up, Kyle?  Oh, thanks, man.  Hey, you guys left out a good one in the beginning when Hollywood's like having the orgasm in the airplane and Maverick guides him in. 
[02:32:30]  He's having an orgasm.  Yeah, he's in shock.  Because, you know, the MIG got a lock on him, and he freaked out.  He lost his edge, and he turned his wings in.  He lost his edge.  So, but it was like he was having an orgasm.  He blew sploots everywhere because of a MIG.  Oh, yeah.  The recruiters were smart, though.  They took recruiting booths to, like, the major movie theaters because they knew that they were going to have. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, people were going to come out.  I want to be a pilot.  Jesus.  I think they had, like, the highest recruit levels for, like, three or four years.  Bobcat Goldthwait used to do a bit on that years ago when the movie was actually out about how, you know, a bunch of people joined the Navy after Top Gun because they wanted to be a fighter pilot and go out with.  But he was saying, like, I want to drive to planes, and I want to have sex with Kelly McGillis and all that stuff.  And then there you are scrubbing a fucking toilet bowl on some tub of shit boat, picking up cigarette butts. 
[02:33:30]  Not as glamorous.  No.  We got another fighter pilot, Craig in Arizona.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  How's it going, man?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, yeah, I loved that fucking movie so much when I was in sixth grade that I actually went in the Air Force, and now I'm a flyer.  Does that make me a raging homosexual?  No, Air Force, you're fine.  The Navy, you're a gay.  Okay, good, good, good.  I couldn't fucking fly in one of those planes.  No. 
[02:34:00]  I couldn't fly in a fighter jet.  We were talking about that, too.  No fucking way.  You know, it's like we've had opportunities to fly with the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds and all that, and it's just, I don't feel like taking that many Gs.  It's just insane.  I mean, I've seen these videos, we're talking about the video clips of the pilots that black out.  Yeah.  Because, you know, now they have pressure suits and stuff, but still, you can only take so many Gs.  They have pressure suits that just squeeze the blood out of your extremities to keep it inside and in your head, and then you're just supposed to do these grunting exercises to force the blood and keep it into your head. 
[02:34:30]  Because if you're doing a really tight turn, it's pulling all the blood out of your brain and putting it into your fucking feet.  What does the pressure suit feel like?  Is it like getting your blood pressure?  It squeezes.  Yeah, like getting your blood pressure.  It'll squeeze your legs.  You know that feeling you get?  Is there a tuxedo?  You know that feeling you get and you're praying that it's going to release?  Yeah.  Because you're like, holy crap, I can't, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Is your whole body getting that feeling? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, you get squeezed and then, you know, keep the blood in your head when you're doing these hygiene maneuvers.  And so they show some guys blacking out, and I just imagine what it's like, because, you know, you ever just wake up and you kind of don't know where, yes, every morning, you don't know where you are?  When you black out.  Are you talking about the time you fell asleep on the air for about 40 minutes?  Yeah, exactly.  And then I woke up and went like, for a second, I'm like, there's a mic in front of me.  I'm like, why am I? 
[02:35:30]  Because you're asleep.  And then you kind of come to and you're going, there's a mic.  You got to kind of acclimate yourself again to your surroundings.  You just, what the fuck is?  But I'm sitting here in a seat.  Could you imagine just blacking out and then waking up and going, I think I was just doing something.  Oh, that's right.  I was being shot at.  And I'm in a plane and I'm plummeting.  Then look at this guy.  Look at this guy black out.  Looks like a Urock.  Oh my God, he's out. 
[02:36:00]  He's out.  Which way is he going?  He's going straight up.  They're doing a loop.  They were doing a real tight fucking loop.  And then he kind of comes to.  Is he out right now?  Yeah, he's coming to.  How is he not puking?  Who's flying it?  Look at him.  And then he looks around like, holy shit, what the fuck?  You come right the fuck out of it.  Like, wow, fuck.  These guys are pros, man.  No kidding.  Is he flying it or is he in the back?  He might be in the back.  I would hate to do that.  Oh my God, no way.  That's just, that's fucking crazy. 
[02:36:30]  I think he's in the back because I don't see him doing a loop like that and passing.  Okay, yeah.  Now he's doing a real high G turn.  He's trying to do the breathing to keep the blood in his head, but he's out again.  There he goes.  You look so stupid when you pass out.  They really do look like an idiot.  They're probably trying to make this guy look like he's a fighter pilot.  It's probably some dumb reporter from...  There goes his head bobbing forward again.  Oh, hey, I'm back.  Maybe that's how they train you.  Maybe that's part of your training.  Oh, you gotta fucking do that. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I'm sure they fucking bring up there and...  Yeah, because you gotta know what to do, right?  Yeah, they throw you in that centrifuge, too, where it just spins you around for minutes at a time.  I want to get a pressure suit and then cut the asshole out of it so it just makes me shit really well.  I want to wear my pressure suit and just all I want to do is sit there with my space helmet and pressure and shit until my fingers are wrinkled like I was in a shower all day.  It just squeezes you like a tube of crest.  Or if you hit a girl with a thin pussy, I want to put a pressure suit on her and cut the cunt area out and fatten her pussy up and fuck her in her pressure suit. 
[02:37:30]  Watch her head drain of all feeling.  When are we getting our white tuxedos, by the way?  Oh, for our shit show.  I asked Anthony this morning, I'm like, do we have a white tuxedo ready or what?  We're going to have to go to the bathroom now.  Hey, Steven S. for Bayshore, he's now calling himself the Minister of Useless Information.  Do you realize, Ant, that it's almost a year ago you fell asleep on the air? 
[02:38:00]  No way!  October 5th, 2007, according to Steven S.  Are you shitting me?  That can't be right.  And you woke up and you just saw this black thing in front of your face and you had to think, all right, I'm either being being facially raped by Yafit Khodo or I dozed off on the radio.  And you actually rooted for the first one.  Yes, of course.  Do you want to talk to a crew chief?  All right.  Ryan in Tennessee.  Hey, fellas.  Hey, buddy.  I was a crew chief in the Air Force in F-15, and I got an incentive right before I left, and we were tracing clouds and doing cute stuff. 
[02:38:30]  And I asked the pilot if we could go ahead and try some dogfighting maneuvers, and he asked me if I was sure.  I said, yeah, let's do it.  So he cranks it up and cranks a 90-degree right turn.  He pulled 8 1⁄2 Gs.  I didn't black out, but my chin was stuck to my chest, and I couldn't move my head.  And I just had to look down on my feet until we got done turning, and that's all I could do.  Fuck that.  I would just puke.  Just puke all over the place.  I get motion sick on a greyhound or on a boat or on a plane. 
[02:39:00]  What are you riding a dog for anyway?  I didn't mean to ride it.  That's just silly.  I was trying to fuck it, and it ran.  And you threw up.  No, I did.  You got motion sick.  You know what it was?  I was about to come, and he took off my cock.  I heard my cock pop out, and it went.  And I got a whiff of dog asshole on my dick, and I fucking ralphed all over my fucking white shoes.  I was wearing nurse shoes, and I threw up on them.  Did you?  I was, and I'll confess now because of the statute of limitations. 
[02:39:30]  I was the nurse-shoed dog fucker who was terrorizing suburban neighborhoods.  There's a nurse-shoed...  Because if people would only see me, I look like Michael Caine in that scene in Dressed to Kill.  When fucking Nancy Allen, that fucking finished whore, gets out of the shower and sees white nurse shoes.  Finished whore?  Oh, she did blah with Travolta after that.  Yeah.  And then his wig fell off, and he made out with a guy in front of a 737 fucking mo. 
[02:40:00]  Nice bald head dick.  He looked like Ed Harris.  You think he takes his wig off when he gets it like 35,000 feet?  It's safe to take the wig off?  Of course he does.  It's pressurized, so it fucking mats to his face like a Lego person.  You may now remove your wigs.  The captain has given the signal to remove your wigs.  We're at 35,000 feet cruising altitude.  No one to see you to be embarrassed.  Please remove your wig. 
[02:40:30]  That's all his plane has on it is asshole grease and those mannequin heads for wigs like Pesci had in JFK.  Asshole grease.  And fucking tube after tube.  He had asshole grease laying around the way Sinatra had cigarettes.  Like every four feet, he has to have a tube of asshole grease.  He hits turbulence, and his wig just pops two or three inches off his head each time.  As he's flying.  He looks like a cartoon character getting angry. 
[02:41:00]  Fucking.  Oh, is that fucking great?  Oh, he gets all askew.  He comes off.  He's been fucked so hard.  It's all crooked and to the left.  He looks like a fucking white hip-hop kid wearing his baseball hat.  But it's his wig.  Oh, his fucking wig.  Oh, he fucking.  How wonderful is that?  That crooked do.  Let's do one more.  Oh, fuck.  That's funny.  One more F-18 pilot here.  Driver. 
[02:41:30]  Driver, really?  Yeah.  All right.  We got Anthony Novata.  Naval Aviators.  Hello there, boys.  Hi, sir.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, and I just had to tell you, man.  It's not a crusher suit.  It's just air bladders that go over the pads.  We call them go-fast pads.  Oh, yeah.  They're so cute about it.  And your boys, the Blues, they don't wear them.  The Blue Angel drivers and the Thunderbird jockeys, they don't wear any kind of go-fast pads.  Why not?  I'm guessing they're not doing the kind of maneuvers you've got to do in combat to need them, right? 
[02:42:00]  All of those maneuvers are exact replicas of everything that we do.  Really?  Why don't they wear them, then?  They take up space, and they can't really have the maneuverability with their hands to hold onto the stick.  You've got about 57 pounds of pressure on that stick, and they're doing those maneuvers a lot more frequently than we would in a combat situation.  These days, most of the time, we'd be able to take out an enemy before we even knew we were there.  What's your call sign?  The call sign's crash.  Crash.  That probably wasn't earned in a very nice way. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, do they have directionals on the planes?  Like if you're going to make a lefty, I can't.  Toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot-toot.  If I get a flat, I need to put out my floor weight.  All right, boy, punch it out.  Well, I hope not.  That's why they call them crash.  Yeah.  You don't want to be call sign crash.  Exactly.  Call sign viper.  I'd rather be caught blowing guy in boot camp.  See that stenciled on the side of your plane? 
[02:43:00]  Lieutenant cocksucker.  I caught some guy blowing you on the phone  Hey, I caught blowing someone at boot camp  What's your vector?  I don't even know what vector means  Sounded good though, Jimmy  Passed out from Sea Lock  Boo again  Boo  Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr  And I'm hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony  This evening, or this afternoon  Or whenever the hell they're running this  All I know is I'm doing this in June 
[02:43:30]  So I'm not even here right now  Alright, I hate to fucking kill your fantasy  I love how I'm looking back on it  It's literally five years and I feel like I'm on Johnny Carson right now  Like I actually have 40 years of incredible radio  So enjoy this one  How was that for an awful ending?  Well, I'm not getting paid, so I don't give a fuck  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony  Hosted by Bill Burr  What happened in Camden, New Jersey  This past Saturday with Bill Burr  Stuff of legend 
[02:44:00]  It really is  I suggest you go to YouTube  And check out the entire performance  Of him just taking on the entire  Crowd  But we have some highlights here  A little booing going on  There were a couple of little booers out in the crowd  Yeah, we should set this up again  Just in case people weren't listening yesterday there, Jimmy  What was the vibe?  I mean, what was going on?  It was getting rough 
[02:44:30]  They booed Jimmy Schubert early  I mean, again, Philly is notoriously rough  And then Tracy got them back  And, you know, the show was going well  But Philly crowds were always on the verge  They were right on the brink  Always  At any minute  And the second half of the show started  Bobby Kelly went out and just kicked ass  Boss killed  Everybody, for the most part, killed  Jimmy Schubert was destroyed  I'm going to give Drew Boogie some props  He did a great job as a DJ, man  He held it together  I mean, believe me  That's a lot more important than people realize 
[02:45:00]  To keep the music going  Keep people happy with what they're listening to  And then Bobby Kelly kills  Don Murray goes out  He's doing well  And then he loses them a little bit  They boo him a little bit  Which was really weird to see a rare  Get booty  Such a good comic  I know, and a legend  But it was late  And again, these psychos  Have been drinking since 11 a.m  So, I mean, they're getting a little rowdy  They booed him a little bit  But he handled it  He handled it better than Schubert did  Because Schubert, I think, just went on autopilot  Whereas Dom kind of, I think, addressed it a little bit  Or slowed it  Whatever he did  He made it work 
[02:45:30]  And he left  Billy Berg comes on  And from what I saw  Bill's first bit or something didn't work  Which happens a lot to us as comics  You know what I mean?  You just come on  And your bit doesn't hit  It's no big deal  You want to open strong, though, don't you?  Yeah, but you do  But again, Billy is in a position on the show  Everybody knows him and likes him  And he's really funny  So he doesn't have to prove himself  It's like, if you're bombing for 10 minutes  They're going to give you a hard time  Right  But one bit  They'll usually  Yeah, no big deal  But I think Bill got annoyed at them  Because they booed Herrera  And said something to them about it 
[02:46:00]  I was watching this on a monitor  And then they started booing him  Started booing Bill  And it got really loud  And I'm like, are they booing Burr?  And then I just heard him snap  And he had a moment of clarity  Yeah  He was going to go down and bomb horribly  Or he was going to attack back  And he attacked back  He knew  In a lovely fashion  He had time backstage to say to himself  Look, if this happens to me out there  I know how I'm going  I know what direction I'm taking  He was a third guy  So he threw his act away  Yep 
[02:46:30]  And then just improv for like 12 minutes  And just beat up Philly  Slammed him  Everyone is talking about this  Everybody is talking about this performance  So, uh, Tham, what's the first clip?  Him getting into the rant?  Uh, yeah  That's when the wheels start  Well, the wheels don't come off  I guess because he killed  But, yeah, it's just him  It's none of his actual, like, normal bits  Right  It's just the start of when he starts losing it  Okay, so, yeah  Uh, the setup basically  He did his act  Or started doing his act  The booing started 
[02:47:00]  And he said, you know what?  Screw you all  And, uh, this is what started to happen  You don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, f*** it  I'll just cook this side for a while  You know what's funny?  I'm cooking my brain  Talking about nothing  I'm just walking around  Like, yeah, I just got a cheeseburger  Oh, f*** all you people  You know what?  You f*** losers  I hope you all f***ing die  And I hope the f***ing Eagles  Never win the Super Bowl  So, f*** them 
[02:47:30]  You don't call you f***ing f***ing  And f*** the players  F*** all of you  You f***ing goddamn f***ing losers  You don't call me Herrera  F*** that f***ing  All of you  F***  Oh, f***ing  What's that?  No, I'm segueing  Into my next joke  Get all religious  My f***ing red f***ing  All of you  You can line up  In your Harold Carmichael f***ing jersey  And one at a time  You can all f*** my f***ing  Oh, my God 
[02:48:00]  How many beefs are in there?  Was that the beginning of the tirade right there?  Oh, yeah  Yeah  It's funny  You could see Bill  With the line about the cheeseburger  As a comic  You could see right there  He's really, like, floundering internally  Going, all right  That was his moment of truth  Like, I'm going to try to just turn this around with this  And then it just  They gave him a little hard time  That was him standing at the crossroad  Right there  It was like, all right  Do I continue with the cheeseburger joke?  Just talking  Because I think he felt 
[02:48:30]  Again, like you said  The wheel's coming off  He was trying to steer  All right, let me get back  Off the shoulder here  And then he just kind of  Saw his wheel rolling in front of the car  And he just aimed for the children  Is this worth playing with all the beeps?  I think it's  At least play a couple of clips  I think it's funny  With the beeps  To just show how  It is funny with the beeps  Vicious it was  Yeah  Please play a little  It took me over two hours to do  No problem  But the people listening on XM  Don't worry, later on this morning  We're going to play the whole thing 
[02:49:00]  Yeah  In the entirety without the beeps  That's right  No bitching  You'll have to hear a couple commercials  But aside from that  We'll play it for you  No bitching  Bill's thing is sponsored by Bud  And for the people that don't have XM  Just go to YouTube  And throw Opie and Anthony in the search  And you'll get to see this  For yourself as well  Or edit it  Or get XM  Or get it  You shizzlers  How about you throw that out there  As an option  No, you've got to balance the two here  Don't you get what's going on?  Well, he means today too  If you push XM too much  Then the people down the hall here get pissed 
[02:49:30]  Oh, I know  And if you don't push XM enough  Then XM down there in Washington gets pissed  It's a balancing act  We're like spinning plates here  I'm looking at poor Elo's face over here  On Pal Talk  And, you know, I just figured  Hey, there's an option perhaps  Do you think I was saying it without saying it?  That's how smart I am  I was keeping everybody happy  I don't like his creepy goatee  It hasn't grown in yet  I don't care  He looks Puerto Rican  And I don't like it 
[02:50:00]  Alright, here's some more  Bill Burr  Takes on Philly on stage  At the Tweeter Center  This is where he gets into  The whole cancer thing  Harold Carmichael jerseys, by the way  Made me really happy  Many of them probably love  A bunch of f***ing f***ing f***ing  Goddamn losers  52 f***ing hours into a show  The f*** am I going to do at this point?

[02:51:00]  You're a f***ing f***ing f***ing  F***ing f***ing  F***ing f***ing  F***ing f***ing  And then he starts counting down  How many more minutes he has  Because like when Dom  Started getting booed  He cut his set  Bill's like  Not only  I'm not cutting my set  I'm doing every single minute  I was supposed to do  He's counting down  Every minute he's doing  That takes balls  Is it worth playing?  We'll continue  I just love hearing the beeps  Actually  At the end there  I don't even know what he was saying  It was just beep, beep, beep 
[02:51:30]  Well then he got into  The Ben Franklin Bridge  Down there in Philly  I hope you all get in your  Force focuses  Drive off the side  Of that faggot ass  Ben Franklin Bridge  You f***ing  One bridge heaven  Piece of f***ing city  That no one gives a f*** about  The terrorists  The terrorists  Will never bomb you people  Because you're f***ing worthless  And no one cares about you  You are this high above  New Orleans  I hope your mother

[02:59:30]  Oh sorry  What I noticed  Was when  When Bill  Like started getting booed  The whole place  Backstage  Was like  What  We gotta see this  Yeah  Everyone went to the side stage  And halfway through it  People  I'm not kidding  Were falling down  High-fiving  They loved it  They couldn't control themselves  And I think Bill  Was gonna walk off  Like this  This effing crowd  But then when he saw  The reaction backstage  I think he realized  He was onto something  Right  I don't know  I was actually  I was worried about going on  So I was kind of  Concentrating on that  And it was odd 
[03:00:00]  I watched what he was doing  And I just kind of felt like  Yeah  He got him back  It was just  It was great to watch man  It was great to see him  Pull that nightmare  Yeah  And make it something  And he made it something  Really funny  And it's  The crowd  As much as they wanted  To smash him  Respected what he did  He got 10,000 people  To turn around  And respect  They loved him  When he left the stage  Yeah  He got a tremendous ovation  Gave him a huge ovation  When he was done  Except for one guy  In the front row  Wanted to beat him up  Yeah one guy  Yeah one guy was truly  Like just hated him

[03:02:30]  Let's go  I was at the  The stadium  On Sunday  Or on Saturday  Night  Yep  And I was sitting  Up on the lawn  And everybody  Was sitting  On the left hand side  Going nuts  You guys still even there  Yeah we're listening  We're listening  We're really good listeners  Your storytelling skills  Stink  Well everybody on my left  Was absolutely going nuts  Bill and Burr  And then all of a sudden  He would say something  And the entire crowd  Would unite in Bill  And then we'd have 
[03:03:00]  And then on the right hand side  We'd all start going nuts  When he actually started  Being funny again  I tell you  I want to thank you Ted  Best sights I've ever seen  Got to thank Ted  Because he kind of  Let us know  When the segment  Was pretty much done  I know  You took a fun  Interesting story  And you built  A quick brick wall up  Congratulations  You're a drunk driver  In a limousine  On the way to a reception  Congratulations Ted 
[03:03:30]  Good job  Everyone was having fun  And now just tragedy  That's right  I guess  You're a 6'1  Blood alcohol level  Plowing into the bride and groom  Ladies and gentlemen  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Hosted by Bill Burr  Ladies and gentlemen  One of the heroes  You know you've heard  A lot about heroes  I'm sure today  Watching the news coverage  That does  It pales in comparison  To the hero  That is in our studio  Right now  Mr. Bill Burr  What's up Bill  Hey gentlemen  Wow  We just discussed your 
[03:04:00]  What did you guys do  This weekend  Oh Jesus  We just discussed  Your set in Camden  Discussed it  We watched it  In the office  It's already a bootleg  On YouTube  I watched it  At home last night  I cannot get enough  Of it  It is the most  Watchable act  I've ever seen  It's like  You could look at it  You could watch it  Ten times  Ten times  And catch something  New every time  Yeah  Animals  Yeah  I literally had a headache  At the end of it  I felt like I yelled  At a relative  You know what it reminded me of 
[03:04:30]  It's like  Somebody that should get  The congressional medal  For rushing a machine gun nest  And actually living through it  Like  And one man  Single handedly  Took out an entire  Machine gun nest  And bunker emplacement  Thought you were gone  Thought you were dead  You turned that around  Can you walk us through it  Because we just  We have no idea  What really happened  We're just getting  Phone calls  And things like that 
[03:05:00]  You walked out on stage  I guess it was after  Dom Herrera  No it was actually  It was after  The show was about  Three hours and fifteen minutes old  Right  And ideally  Jim what would you say  About ninety minutes  Is the ideal comedy show  Yes and you want to go on  Probably fifty minutes  Into the ninety minutes  At the latest  An hour at the latest  Ideally  The people aren't drinking  In a parking lot  For seven hours  Before the three hours  And fifteen minutes starts  It was basically  I don't know what had happened  It turned into Ozfest 
[03:05:30]  Up on the lawn  Yeah  And they were booing guys  Like even guys  Who were doing well  I was kind of walking  To the side  And they were booing  And it was just getting  Worse and worse  So you heard where  It was coming from  I really had no idea  They kept saying  It was up to the left  It sounded to me  When I was out there  Like it was coming  From everywhere  I can't admit  But  So anyway  So  Then Dom goes out  And Dom's doing a great job  And it's just  Almost like they just decided  Yeah  Out of nowhere  They're booing the guy  And this is like  This guy's like from Philly 
[03:06:00]  Yep  He's been doing it forever  Half the reason  They got comedy clubs  In that damn city  Is because of this guy  They boo him off  Like they don't even know him  So  Unbelievable  And Dom's funny  I mean he doesn't deserve  To be booed  He's a great comic  Exactly  So  I was pissed  And I went out there  And the second I walked out  I was like  You know  Hey  You know  Whatever  I was walking down the street  Did ya  They started yelling  And heckling  Oh boy  And then I went into that  Hitler bit  And I was like  Oh no  They've been playing this  On Opium Ante  Like 9,000 times  And I kind of messed that up 
[03:06:30]  And then they started booing me  And fortunately  I had been booed before  And I made  I had made mental notes  About things that I did  That I liked  And didn't like  And there was a lot more stuff  That I didn't like  So I just  I had made a mental note  The next time  Whatever happened  I'm talking about all your mothers  I'm trashing your city  Anything I can think about  And I'm not  The Liberty Bell  Rocky  The Betsy Ross Bridge  Cheese sticks  The sports teams  The fact they hate blacks 
[03:07:00]  The sports teams  Exactly Anthony  I swear to God  I already mentally worked it out  If they started throwing stuff  I was going to go behind the DJ booth  And I was still going to finish  I just was not  You were dedicated to finishing  Oh yeah  I was in the back watching  Oh it was fantastic  Again because you couldn't hear  The audience response  From the monitors  And I saw you go  What are you people  Not going to laugh  Like you just scolded them  Like Bill  Because you are like  I hate to say money in the bank  It's a faggot expression  You never had bad sets  Especially gigs like this 
[03:07:30]  I'm like how could they give Bill  A hard time  And then you just went crazy  It was so good  And he made all this up  So great  Off the cuff  And we need to tell people that again  This wasn't your act  This wasn't what you decided to do in Philly  You were just making it up  As you go along  In front of 10,000 people  That to me  I bow to you today  That was the funny thing  I had a bunch of people  Had come up to me  Not all those people afterwards  Probably at least 15 people  Had come up to me  And they were like  Did you just make that up  Or is that like part of your act  Oh no  That's a 15 minute chunk of my act 
[03:08:00]  When I go to Seattle  Yeah  I just go off on specific stuff  About Philly  And somehow it kills  Yeah  That's what I was amazed at too  It's like  God this guy knows a lot about Philly  Oh yeah  Dude you should be leading tours there  In your time off  It was frightening  Everything about Philly  He just recalled stuff  Subconsciously  That he'd heard in school  It was like your whole brain  Worked for you  And it's just great  The team's old players  From the Phillies  Like he's just  Roman Gabriel  He's pulling up old players  From uh  Yeah  Joe Frazier 
[03:08:30]  You mentioned Roman Gabriel  And the lack of respect he gets  And then you yelled  You don't know who he is  You just  You mentioned him  And then you screamed at them  They're not gonna win ever  They're never gonna win  It was good to see  The real Bill Burr finally  Because we know  This is what you're really about  Absolutely  And it finally came out  For everybody  It was fantastic to watch  You saw the reason  Why I need to do this  To me  When I was watching that  Like watching you  Yell like that  And just  Just  Just berate them 
[03:09:00]  I'm like  That's what Bill  He hears in his head  Every time he looks  Into the mirror  I never loved anyone  As much as I loved  Watching you do that  And you  You completely  Turned them around  When you were done  And you did your little countdown  Every minute  Like I said  There's a teleprompt  They're showing the comics  How much time they had left  And you'd berate the audience  And they'd go  Okay  Six minutes  And you kept going  And going  And I'm selling my CD  Yeah  And I'm selling my CD  And then you turned them around 
[03:09:30]  And they're laughing  Their asses off  Now the laughs are much bigger  Than the boos  But the boos continued  Right  And you knew  That you had them  And then you're like  And I still hate you people  Yeah  I still hate you people  And when you left  They gave you  A hell of an ovation  Yeah  Just for  For doing that  I gotta tell you  It was one of the most  Amazing things I've ever seen  Bill  I never saw a set like that  In my life  As far as comic things go  The brutal honesty  Of what you did  And the fact that it was  It looked fearless  I mean as a comic  I understand how we are internally 
[03:10:00]  But just the fact that you  Exploded  And weren't gonna back down  And they knew it  He's not leaving  He's not leaving  He will not leave  You can only boo so loud  So they just knew  That you were gonna kick  10,000 people in the face  For 15 minutes  Until your time was up  And it was just great  Tony Montana  Up on the balcony  Getting shot  Come on  And that guy  That guy walked up to your back  With a shotgun  And you turn around  And you slapped him  With your hog  Yeah it was blind  It was blind rage 
[03:10:30]  To the point when I got off  I wasn't even  I was  Really when I walked back there  I didn't know  What the reaction of you  Dude  We all ran to the stage  Because you know  The word spread  Bill Byrd's getting booed  And he's just attacking the crowd  We all  Every single person backstage  Just about  Was on the side stage  Just watching  We're jumping up and down  We're hugging each other  We're falling on the ground  Like idiots  We loved it  Having gay sex  Right  Just how to mention  That's right  That's what I told myself 
[03:11:00]  In the rest area  Last night  This one's for Billy  And someone bootlegged it  It's up on YouTube  And the word hasn't  Even really spread  I mean now it has  Obviously because we're  Talking about it  But this morning  It was already downloaded  Thousands of times  I'm like  Man  People are talking  About this thing  You go to YouTube  And just throw  Opie and Anthony  In the search  And there it is  It's there  The first time I got booed  That  Is this amazing feeling  When you just realize  You can't get him back  And the first time  I got booed  I didn't leave that time 
[03:11:30]  But  I kept trying to do jokes  Or something  It wasn't  I didn't leave  Or whatever  And then they ended up  Bringing me off  And people came up to me  Afterwards going  I got like  These awful compliments  Like  I thought you were funny  Oh yeah  And the best one  You mean all the compliments  Jimmy Schubert  Was getting after his set  I mean that too  He just got thrown  To the dogs  Oh my god  Jimmy Schubert is hilarious  Like  That was the thing  Because I love Jimmy  So I was pissed  From the beginning of the show  Yeah  And having gotten booed 
[03:12:00]  I know what he was going through  Then he's got to stand there  For the  What was it  The five hours  And you two guys  Jesus Christ  Before I go up  These two  And what do we do  Stand up virgins  Hey we got this great idea  Oh we were just trying  We're going to walk  Forty rows  Through the crowd  Yeah  That's great  Anything you can do  To steal their focus  More from the  And whip them in  Hey so we get credit  For your brilliant set  That people will be  Talking about for years  And then they go  To the concert  And right after we intro  You fifty rows in  The two stars of the show 
[03:12:30]  We're just going to  Cut off the lights  And they're not going to  Look at us  And try to find out  Where we're going  I thought that was  A little ridiculous too  Like I was like  Uh oh  This could be distracting  To the comedian  We make it up  As we go along  What can I tell you  We won't do that again  Bill  But Jimmy Shearer  Was your biggest cheerleader  On the side of the stage  He was jumping up and down  Just applauding  Oh yeah  Oh we were joking  About that afterwards  I felt like we caught  The last chopper  On a nom  We were going to look down  And see like  Dom Irera  Like Willem Dafoe  In the tree line 
[03:13:00]  Oh it was brutal  It was unbelievable  You must have seen him  It was platoon  You must have seen him  Though getting booed  Know what it's like  To be booed  Saw what the crowd  Is like  And kind of prepared  Yourself like  If these sons of bitches  Even try  I am unloading  My mindset  When I walked out  Was you animals  You don't even deserve  A show  I'm going to come out  And I'm going to  Start tap dance  To try to get your attention  You're not even  Giving anybody any chances  So the second  They started  You were already  Locked and loaded 
[03:13:30]  Ready to go  I'm talking about  It's like  I don't know  Why I even  Ironed my shirt  To come out here  I don't even remember  Half the stuff  I said it was  Oh my god  Total terrestrial  I've watched it  Like ten times already  It is all good  And it is all brutal  Yeah  It's just fantastic  I've never  Ever seen a set like that  I've never seen anyone  Handle a stupid heckler  In a club  Is one thing  You got ten thousand people  And you just  Trashed them  To the point  Where they loved you  When you left  The Worst of Opie and Anthony

[03:15:00]  Okay this next clip  Coming up  It says  Comedians  Myself  And Ralphie May  We're in studio  And we're palling around  You know what I mean  I'm having a bacon  Egg and cheese  And uh  Ralphie's eating  A full chicken  Head and all  So anyways  I love conspiracy theories  And evidently  Ralphie was into them too  And I really loved this  I found out about Ralphie  That he's totally into guns  He bought a place  I believe out in Tennessee  That has its own well water 
[03:15:30]  He's totally into it  And there's just  Nothing funnier  Than an armed  700 pound comedian  Um  But anyways  We talk about  Conspiracy  Conspiracy theories  Surrounding the bailouts  Of the banks  The car industries  And colonizing the world  And uh  And after that clip  That's gonna be the end  Of my five hour tour here  I hope you enjoyed it  Alright  Go fuck yourselves  Broadcasting  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Hosted by Bill Burr  The three CEOs  For the big three automakers  Are in Washington 
[03:16:00]  They're trying to get money  To bail them out  Because they're all  In the shitter  So they were  Chastised the other day  At least the General Motors guy  For flying in  Using his private jet  To fly in  And it's like  You cry in poverty  And you're flying in  In a private jet  So now  Like this isn't  Some calculated  Fucking move  They're all driving in  In hybrid vehicles  Driving  It's like  Why not just take a  I don't think anybody  Would fault the CEO  If they've got him  A first class ticket  On American Airlines 
[03:16:30]  I don't think  It's a business trip  Of course  You fly in a commercial airline  If you fly in a private jet  You're gonna catch shit  But if you fly  You know  A regular airline  But now it's like  Look at us  Could you please  It's like when they  You see a fucking murderer  And it's just a savage  Fucking animal  That they caught  His mugshot  And everything  And then in court  They're all clean shaved  Hair cut  In a suit  And they're like  This guy's never  Looked like this  Right  How come they're getting  So much shit  And the bankers didn't  That's what I don't understand 
[03:17:00]  I don't understand  That's an odd thing  They stole three quarters  Of a trillion dollars  We're gonna help you guys out  You know what  Actually we're gonna keep it  And buy other banks  I think the government  Had their hands  So far into the banking industry  Anyway  With the lawmakers  And the deregulation  The power that they gave  These banks  That wound up  Turning into the fucking  That they had to do something  Or else it was gonna get  To the point where it's like  Oh shit  Wait a minute  I'm to blame  So they threw money  At the banks  The automakers though 
[03:17:30]  They you know  Dug their own grave  Pumping out fucking SUVs  While gas was at  Four dollars a gallon  But we just gave them  Three quarters of a trillion dollars  That they were gonna help us with  And then they decided  To keep it  Because stuff changed  Over like two months  Yeah so now they're  Buying other banks with it  And you know  They're using it  As just capital  As liquid assets  That they have  Yeah and they're charging me  Like three times the fees  Yeah  I didn't do shit  This wasn't a bailout  It was like  Here here's some cash  Business as usual  But now you have  A lot more money  Yeah 
[03:18:00]  Frightening  What has happened  I'm waiting for the big downfall  The other day  I guess yesterday  A Russian battleship  And a few other ships  Went through the Panama Canal  For the first time  Since World War II  And they had a little meeting  With Venezuela  Another country that just loves us  And it's all adding up to  The United States is becoming  Just nothing  Vulnerable  We're becoming this  Soon we'll be a third world nation 
[03:18:30]  Relatively soon  But in the meantime  We're just losing any power  And any influence  We had in the world  Because we're  We're like a joke now  Europe is all  Happy and friendly  With each other  They got their own  Fucking money now  Germany seems to be  In check for the time being  No they don't  They're where we're gonna be  Their euro  Yeah  They're gonna put us all  On the Amero  This all goes back  To the Amero  One world bank  One world government  That's what they're going to  They already did it  Oh I love this  This is the Illuminati  No it isn't dude  No I know  It's like  They want to have the Amero  Where it's like Canada 
[03:19:00]  I get so much shit  For this conspiracy theory stuff  All this shit that's happening  I read about this  Like a year ago  On the internet  Which of course  The internet man  The internet lies  TV's telling you the truth  Yeah yeah  But the internet  That's all lies  It's dude  I'm telling you  The only way we would ever  Get off the dollars  Is if they so fucking  Devalued it  And that's exactly  What they're doing  NAFTA made no sense  Hey let's take all  The industry from this country  Give it to other people  And fuck everybody here  And stick them in cubicles  And this is like  The last thing  That they can fuck us on  Is the big three 
[03:19:30]  These are the guys  Who made the tanks  And the jeeps  When we go to war  Right right right  We gotta get rid of this shit  Yeah yeah  The fucking Somalian pirates  Can take us over  At this point  We love those stories  But one global bank  Not necessarily one bank  But one monetary unit  One unit as a planet  Is actually advancement  I mean it eventually  A planetary unit  Is actually  How is that  Because  That gives a lot of power  To someone  No no no  I'm not talking about that  Some entity  I'm talking about  Beyond that  Eventually 
[03:20:00]  When we're not  Breaking ourselves down  Into different  Quat lubes  When you're looking at  Like  And Dr. Kaku  Talks about that  When you're looking at  Like planetary things  Like colonizing the moon  Or advancing in space  Earth is gonna have to be  One group  Can't happen  It will though  Of course it will  To me  Like individualism  I know it sounds crazy  Is a part of being primitive  As we advance  They're setting up  An aristocracy  You're a commie  No no no  They're not bringing  Us together  I'm not about them even 
[03:20:30]  I'm talking about  As a group  As we all eventually  It will all work itself out  It's just gonna take  A long long long time  But to colonize the moon  And to branch out  Into space  No one's gonna say  He's doing a bit right now  No  100%  Is he serious  No he's serious  100% serious  He's filibustering  100% serious  Listen like Dr. Kaku  When he talks about  Dr. Kaku ring  When he talks about  Like planetary powers  And advancement of a species  We're not ready to wing off  And start commerce  With Saturn  No not yet we are 
[03:21:00]  But you have to start  I'm talking about  Like going out into space  And utilizing  Stuff like that  As opposed to  Just like  Our fucking earth resources  Banks are nothing more  It's legalized extortion  I'm not even talking  About the banks  That's all it is  Dude  27% interest rate  What point is it  They're rapists  They're awful  They're rapists  They should be shot  I'm not talking about that  Is the entire world  Is run by those guys  You didn't pick  In fucking gym class  Those people who  Struck out  Playing kickball  The Jews  No  But I'm not  Why you always got to  Dude it's blue bloods 
[03:21:30]  Blue bloods  Straight across  Straight across  Yeah  But I'm not talking  Fellas all those  But I'm not talking  About them  I'm not even saying  You're wrong  I'm not talking  About them  I'm talking about  You're talking  About colonizing  Colonizing space  But it's a reality  It's where we're headed  I'm talking about MasterCard  It's where we're headed  It's like  When you look beyond  As a species  I'm not just talking  About the next  100 or 200 years  When you look  As a species  People talk about  Space travel  And advanced civilizations  Picture a thousand years  Or two thousand years  Into our evolution  As a species  Are we still going to  Be broken down  Into states  And fuck 
[03:22:00]  Are we going to be like  This is  The earth is one unit  Do you think  That's a good thing  Of course it is  How is that a good thing  When certain cultures  Advance faster  And better than  Other cultures  It will eventually  Become a planetary culture  But again  Dude  It might be  Five thousand years from now  But eventually  That to me  Is going to happen  Five thousand years  We're talking about  Maybe twenty years  Population problem  Right now  To the point  We're melting  The ice  That's what  They're talking  About  Exactly  What they're going  To end up doing  Is there's going  To be a bunch 
[03:22:30]  Of people  Who are going  To get processed  Dude  I swear to god  I was watching  This thing on  Hitler the other day  Hey yeah  I watch those  All the time  When they got  In control  In parliament  Or whatever  Their branch  Of government  Was  They signed  They passed  Through this  Whole  Pact  That basically  All of a sudden  They could start  Arresting people  Without charging them  Detaining them  It was the fucking  Patriot Act  It's the same thing  Dude  Like I don't know  What's  I feel like  I'm living in Germany  In 1931  If only  And we're all  Sitting here  Oh dare to dream  With beer steins 
[03:23:00]  In our hands  Just having fun  You know what  The thing is  Anthony  Watching the  Anthony thinks  He's going to  Make the cut  He thinks he's  Making the team  I would make  The team  You're not  Making the team  You're going to  Meet a railroad car  Right next to me  What are your skills  What are your skills  When they take  Detention camp  I'm essential  To the war effort  He's a great shoveler  When they take  Detention camp  What are you going  To say  I talk shit  Into a microphone  For 20 years  I am very influential  I could be  The minister  I could be  A minister  Of propaganda  I am asking  The questions  Do you have 
[03:23:30]  Any science  Background  Yes of course  Explain your mustache  I could be  A minister  Of propaganda  I could spread  The word  That needs  Be spread  Amongst the people  The common people  The best you can  Hope for is  You're going to  Be sitting in a  Trench  Like it's 1918  With tear gas  Being thrown at me  You're going to be  The guys who are  Going to sing  Silent night  On new year's eve  And get one  Between the eyes  An hour  Before the war  Ends  Don't you see 
[03:24:00]  How like we have  This  And again  We're in the  Minuscule part  Of what's  Eventually going to  Happen  When you look at  I'm not talking  About the banking  Scumbag  On a bigger picture  When you look at  Like the cosmonauts  In the space station  Of the Russians  And the Americans  And now we're  Talking about  Going to Mars  That's all about  Colonizing  Fucking moons  And it's not just  About overpopulation  It's about certain  Natural disasters  Will eventually  Threaten the earth  Jim there's no  Atmosphere  You can't  Colonize those  Of course  You have to  Make a creative  False atmosphere  Or something  We call them  Shaken Bay colonies  We absolutely 
[03:24:30]  Sham wow moon  We absolutely  Will eventually  Live on other places  We're going to  End up going to  LV 426  And set up  A Shaken Bay colony  No we're not  What they're going to  Do is  They're going to  Fucking eliminate  At least  The company  Manufactancies  A good 3-4 billion people  They're going to  Be processed  And then you know  I don't know  There's going to be  A gated community  And servants  You think that's it  That kind of class  We're going back  To a feudal system  Feudal system  Survival of the species 
[03:25:00]  Dictates that we have  To be able to  Eventually move  From where we are now  I can't agree with Jimmy  Well you know  You can kind of  Talk about what might  Happen in 5,000 years  That's what I'm talking about  It's all speculation  Yes  The thing is  All of our technology  That we have  Is based on  Where you're from  And what was necessary  For the time  Space travel  The only fucking reason  We did that  Was to show the Soviets  Who we hated  That we were better than them  And the reason that  They had their program 
[03:25:30]  Was that  If there's no competition  In this world  We're not going to  All join together  For the good of science  To do anything  No  We base  Our whole technology  Our whole advancement  And evolution  Is based on  Hating  Someone else  Which  Beyond that  Is a need  To survive ourselves  It's not just the anger  Beneath that  Is my hatred of you  Is a threat  To my survival  So it's like  When you look at  Kama Shoemaker-Levy  Hitting Jupiter  Was a major event  Because it made 
[03:26:00]  Fucking  It made clouds  That were the size  Of our planet  And the earth  Gets battered all the time  The moon has obviously  Been battered  It's not crazy  That something  A quarter mile long  Will hit the planet  That's not  Out of the realm  Of speculation  And eventually  We'll be able  To see that happening  It's a necessary  Part of survival  And like  That would be  A godsend  Compared to  Fucking walking around  With a microchip  With all your  Information on it  And if you  Fuck with the deal  They turn your chip off  And you become homeless  That's 
[03:26:30]  Shut your chip off  They're not going to  Totally turn it off  They'll just turn off  All the financial shit  So then all of a sudden  You're saying that  You walk around  And the chip  Is your life  It's all your information  Your financial information  And then if you  Fuck with the system  They shut your chip off  And all of a sudden  You don't own your house anymore  You have no money  No car  And you're homeless  You're out  But they won't  Totally turn your chip off  Because they're still  Going to need to know  Where you are  Because they can't have  A group of chipless people  All getting together  If we mass together  As chipless people  Like a little Smith movie 
[03:27:00]  Then you have power  Yeah  Then you have power  You'll be completely  100% fucked  And they're going to  Be able to do it  I love Phil Ver  They're going to be able  To do it  And everybody's going  To say the exact  Same stupid shit  That they said  When they started  Tapping our phones  Going well you know  If you ain't doing  Nothing wrong  What's the problem  Because you're taking  Away your ability  To ever rebel  Against oppressive  Rulership  Thank you  That's why I feel  Strong about the  Second Amendment  Which is why  People like Rosie O'Donnell  Do not understand  The importance of  The Second Amendment 
[03:27:30]  The right to bear arms  Yeah  Let's just have the  Government and bad guys  Be armed  And the rest of us  Will be sitting here  Like fucking idiots  We're already screwed  Dude  How do you  Like back in the day  You could actually  Put together a militia  And have a good  You know standoff  A good scrum  Yep  You know packing  Now what am I  What am I going to do  With some guy in an F-16  And I got my little  My paintball gun  But the thing is  Look at how rebels  Have done  How well they've done  In Afghanistan  Against the Soviet Union  In Iraq  Against the United States  That's true  They usually  Just an armed 
[03:28:00]  With basic weapons  Public that is  Outraged at an army  Doing shit  Has done very well  Vietnam is another  Prime example  We out  Fucking  Outplayed them  As far as  Equipment goes  Yeah  Tenfold  Even more  And they kicked our ass  Threw us right the fuck  Out of there  Dude when you got  The commitment to be like  Did you ever see the footage  Of that one legged soldier  With the AK-47  Oh yeah  Yeah  Jumping around  And shooting that  Fucking thing  If you're going to fight  To that level 
[03:28:30]  It's just like  It's just not happening  I just can't picture  Americans being on that level  Like I always  Said I can never picture  An American  A bunch of American refugees  Having to go into Mexico  And Canada  Just streaming in  With like  Like when you see refugees  They have their kids  Hanging on a tit  And something  Maybe a change of clothes  On their head  And we'd be like  With our nice  Rolling suitcase  And with useless makeup  And shit  I'm going to tell you dude  And just horrible stuff 
[03:29:00]  It would come back quick  That Viking DNA  You think  Look at the history  Of this country  We all got it in our genes  Well hopefully those people  That would need that shit  Would be gone  Just fucking gone  And the people that are  A little stronger  And can survive  Jesus Christ  Off of the fucking land  Might be  That  You know sometimes  You need a good purge  Purging of these  Motherfucking assholes  To  To  Rebuild on  Have you seen that commercial  For the Duracell batteries  Where you remember  Oh yes  That's an actual bit  From my act 
[03:29:30]  Where I talk  You know  Back in the day  When they sold batteries  It was some guy in the rain  Like oh thank god  I had batteries in my flashlight  Now they're selling batteries  Some woman can't find her kid  In the park  Kevin  Kevin  Oh my god  Kevin  Then she takes out  That little device  Tracking device  And there comes fucking Kevin  Running over the hill  And they're like  Duracell batteries  It's like dude  Fuck the batteries  What was that thing  She just took out of the pocket  That kid's sneakers  Weren't glowing  He didn't have an antenna  Coming out of his head  What the fuck was that  Yeah where was the other part of that 
[03:30:00]  Evidently it's a band  That has the microchip in it  But they never show that part  No  Dude they're gradually  They're making us comfortable  They're gonna know  They're gonna  Of the possibility  They're gonna create a fear  Start with the commercials  They're gonna create a fear  That if you don't  If you don't do this to your kid  You're gonna lose your kid  My big conspiracy theory  Is whatever they're doing to dogs  They're gonna be doing to us  In ten years  Dogs right now  Are microchipped  Castrated  Sitting in shelters  Waiting to be rescued  That's gonna be us  We're gonna be in FEMA camps  Avenge me 
[03:30:30]  Boys  Avenge me  Avenge me  You forget that we're evolving though  You forget that  We are not evolving  We're not  We are physically  You need to read about banking  We absolutely are  And realize what's really going on dude  We're not evolving fast enough  For how we're fucking ourselves up  Look at where we were  You want to go Cro-Magnon era  To where we are now  You think we just stop evolving  We don't stop evolving  Physically and mental capability  Hasn't changed  Back in the days  We had the same 
[03:31:00]  Brain area  As a Cro-Magnon  We started  As we do now  It was all just filling in  What we were ignorant of  The intelligence potential  Was always there  But we didn't know anything  Because we hadn't done anything  It took a long time  To figure shit out  But after we figured it out  That's just what we do as humans  We're very curious things  And just because  The physical evolutions  Take millions of years  Like the sharks  Really haven't evolved  But we are still evolving  I'm telling you  We are  We're getting more connected  Mentally  I'm not evolving  But you know something 
[03:31:30]  It's not at this rapid rate  Where even in 5,000 years  We're going to be any better  Than we were  Than we are now  We suck  We have hatred in us  We have primal instincts  Yes  That prevent us  From being united  Like a bunch of monkeys  Like a bunch of monkeys  That hate other people  Because they look different  Just because you used to have  A record player  And now you have an iPod  That is another evolution  That's not evolution  Not at all  Exactly  And because they can listen  To your phone calls now  That is not  I'm not talking about that 
[03:32:00]  You're misreading me  I'm not saying that  You're talking about Saturn  Another fucking finger  Would be evolution  A fucking dick  Growing out of your forehead  So we didn't just  Eat ass while you fuck a girl  Is evolution  What do you think  We didn't just show up here  As you agree with her  Yes  That does feel good  We didn't just show up here  With two legs and two arms  We came out of the fucking gunk  Millions of years ago  I'm not talking about us evolving  But I  That's what's eventually  Why do you think they're living  Above the earth  In a fucking  And I know there's probably 
[03:32:30]  Some paranoid reason  It is eventually to learn  How to adapt to space  Because we're eventually  Going to have to move  We're going to have to  That wasn't the initial idea  That's eventually  Yes  We're talking about  Two different things here  I'm talking about  How a lot of this shit  That they used to tell me  When I was a kid  That I'm lucky  I don't live in Russia  Because now they can do this  Is now they can do it  Now they can  They can pull up  In a black van  And just arrest you  For nothing  Because they suspect  You of terrorism  You never were able  To do that shit  You were never able  To do that  That's not evolution 
[03:33:00]  That's not evolution  That is losing  I'm not saying  It is evolution  You're taking a conspiracy theory  And what I'm saying  The Patriot Act  Is not a conspiracy theory  It's a document  But you just said  Pulling up and arresting people  For no reason  And they're doing it  Like they used to do in Russia  No I'm saying  They can't  They can legally do that now  They can't just arrest you  Without any  Yes they can  Without any  Yes they can  I don't believe you  They can just walk in  And arrest Anthony  We suspect him of terrorism  Yes  No court order  Yes they can  And absolutely no  No grounds for suspicion  Yes  I don't believe it  Yes  I can't buy it 
[03:33:30]  You can't hold me  Yeah I don't buy it  They can hold you  They can arrest you  Jose Padilla  They held indefinitely  Under the Patriot Act  Under the Patriot Act  All they have to do  Is declare him  What would I have to have done though  They just have to brand you  Suspected of terrorist activity  For what  What did I do  What's proof  Whatever they fucking  Can come up with  They don't have proof  They don't need it  You know something  Everyone down in Guantanamo  I don't think there's  Some fucking guy  That was working at  You know  A Jiffy Lube  In Guantanamo  Separate argument  What the fuck happened  Separate argument  You're making a separate argument 
[03:34:00]  From what I was making  It is a separate argument  I was talking about that  It's a completely separate argument  I'm just saying that  What they're doing to them down there  They can do to you  But Bill you're making  A separate argument  From what I was making  I was talking about  Let's talk over each other  You were talking about  Two different things  You're making a separate argument  From what I was making  I wasn't making an argument  The standing president  Can now suspend elections  If they want to  I'm not talking  Indefinitely  I'm not talking about  The Patriot Act  I'm not talking about  Oh we're going to get arrested  I'm talking about  As becoming  Like you're talking about 
[03:34:30]  Europe becoming one  Or the US and South America  And all these things  Eventually happening  Yeah there's a lot of  Shitty elements to it  But eventually  We are going to become  One planetary unit  Like as far  We are going to  And everybody's going to be  Puerto Rican  And the reason for that  Is for power  It's not to evolve  And to have world peace  I didn't say world peace  But power as a planet  Where we are eventually  Going to go out into space  And go to other places  That's eventually going to happen  Neither person can hear  What the other person is saying 
[03:35:00]  But I am here  We're having two different arguments  I don't know what you're saying  You're using conspiracy theories  This is two different arguments  I know it is  I'm not using  Patriot Act is not conspiracy theory  But you're acting like  The dog thing  I made a little funny there  Yeah  Okay I'll give you that  It is supposed to be a comedy show  But the Patriot Act  Is not a conspiracy theory  But Americans are not just  Being sopped up  And thrown in jail  By black vans  You know Jimmy  One of my things  On my to-do list today  Is to buy your book  Okay  And I'm going to tell you  If we can continue  To argue like this  Which one?  They're both bestsellers  I'm just joking 
[03:35:30]  When I'm arguing about it  You don't like the fact  That I'm talking about  Something else  I'm talking about something  I was trying to have  A funny way out of this  No there's two different  Arguments going on here  I'm saying  Two completely different arguments  I was only  When you were saying  That we're becoming  Europe is one unit  And the U.S.  Is becoming this  The United States  Of North America  It's not always  It's not all awful  That we become  Like one group  As a planet  I think it is  Fuck the bankers  I'm not talking  I even said  Yeah fuck the bankers  They just created  All this  What you're doing 
[03:36:00]  I said  I wasn't disagreeing with you  And I said that  I said I'm not even  Saying you're wrong  About that shit  I'm talking about  Another part of it  Becoming one group  As a planet  Is not a bad thing  I even said  I wasn't disagreeing with you  I don't think  It raises us up  I think it lowers us  To everybody else's level  That's what the thing is  America's been  Its elite nation  And then by watering us down  Doesn't make us better  Every empire falls  Get used to it  The Romans  The fucking  Denghis Khan  They ruled a lot longer  Than we did  And they went down  The fucking toilet  It happens to everyone 
[03:36:30]  We are going to go  I don't know why  We think we're so different  We're not  What about the  Difference in religion though  How does that play out  In your future  Eventually if there's ever  Here's what happens  You find life on another planet  Like they now just recently  Photographed for the first time  Other planets  They're not just the fucking  Blip of a star  Going around something  They actually have  A photograph  Of a distant like  Heat or whatever  Coming off a planet  Once life is  Fucking confirmed  On other planets 
[03:37:00]  And it becomes a part of  What we know to be the truth  Religions will fight it  But eventually  Religions  To me religions are a sign  Of being primitive  They will eventually go away  Eventually in time  Over thousands and thousands  Of years of evolution  And of evolution of thinking  They will eventually go away  Just like the fact  That when we look at  What Zeus  And all that shit  That no longer holds water  I'm not saying  That the nonsense  Hasn't changed  But once we find life  On other planets  And it's confirmed  And more than just  A water molecule  Once we have the ability 
[03:37:30]  To confirm life  On other planets  The idea of religion  Will absolutely change  And a lot of it  Will be lost  Did you get this  Knowledge from Yale  No, no, no  But I mean  I'm not saying  Anything crazy either  I think Bill and I  Are talking about  Two massively different scales  Yeah, we were having  A conversation about one thing  And then you jumped in  With this planetary stuff  Well I didn't mean  To interrupt your conversation  Sorry  No, no, no  I'm not saying that  Sorry, I was on the show too  I didn't mean to  Jump in and wreck things  I didn't say you couldn't go in  But you completely 
[03:38:00]  Changed the subject  That's what  Like  That's why  I didn't understand  What you're saying  I was only  I didn't mean to change  Common ground here  The common ground was  You just made me think  Of something  When you were talking  About Europe as a whole  Right  Now Europe is this whole thing  And I would say  I agree with you  To a certain point  But I didn't think  In the end game  That us being one thing  Is a bad  Like there's shitty parts of it  But eventually  We are going to wind up  That way  So even though  There's shitty elements  To Europe being a part  Well usually one monetary unit  And there's dangerous  Aspects to it 
[03:38:30]  I do think that eventually  That's where we're headed anyway  I don't disagree with you Jimmy  But how long would that take  Oh I don't know  Thousands and thousands  And thousands of years  I don't know why Bill's so irritated  That I jumped in with that  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not irritated  I was trying to understand  What you were saying  But I was saying  We were talking about  Like whatever  I don't know how to make this  To simplify  Say we were talking about  Dunkin' Donuts down the street  You started talking about  Malls of the future  But not out of nowhere  Because you made me think of something  All right  Well let's do  No I'm not saying you're wrong Jim  I just didn't get what you were saying 
[03:39:00]  Now I kind of understand  What you're saying  I don't even understand how it relates  To what we were talking about  But I'm an idiot  So that's not on you  Well I'll explain to you  How it connects  To what you were saying  With the euro and Europe  Being one entity  As far as money goes  And then you added to  Like well the Americas  Are all going to be one  North America  South America  Yeah  And I was saying  That individualism in countries  The idea of that  Is going to go away  Eventually anyway  Not discounting  That the bankers are scumbag  And what you're saying  Not discounting any of that  Okay  But my thing about it is Jim 
[03:39:30]  Is us being separate  Is not like  They're not getting rid of that  Because that's a primitive way  Of thinking  I'm not talking about  If I could finish  Oh god sorry  Okay  The reason why they're doing that  Is because they want to have  One world bank  That prints the currency  For the entire world  At interest  And which basically  Financially enslaves  The entire world  You make a ton of fucking cash  That's why they're doing it  Not to help people  Not to end wars  Not to make shit better  I'm not talking about they  Who is they?  It's us  Who is they? 
[03:40:00]  I'm talking about  It's a species  We're people  I don't look at it  Like there's a magical way  No I'm not  I'm talking about  Like the Federal Reserve  You read about  The Federal Reserve  Dude  They print the money  For this country  At interest  You can't get out  Of debt with that  It's a private corporation  It's not a government  The Federal Reserve  Is not a  It's not a governmental entity  It's a private corporation  That prints the money  For this country  Okay so I can't  Disprove what you're saying  You can't prove  What you're saying  That's why  Maybe you're right  About what the Federal Reserve is  But you can't prove  Where this is going to go  I can send you  To some information  You're saying 
[03:40:30]  That we're all going to be  Slaves to one world government  Dude have you ever done  The math on your mortgage?  Um  Kind of yeah  That's why I pay  Into the principal  I have a $350,000 loan  If I take 30 years  To pay it  I pay back $766,000  Yes that's why  I pay into principal  Yes I have done that  I do that too  How is that fucking  And this is basically  The brilliance of it  How is that legal right?  Exactly  It's sickening  It's sickening  Remember back in the day  You had a couple friends  You got together  You fucking built a log cabin  You had a house raising party  It was over  You didn't have to 
[03:41:00]  Fucking work at Staples  For 30 years  Then by the time you're done  And people are so fucking stupid  At the end of that loan  They're like  I paid $350,000 for it  Now it's worth $800,000  No stupid  You paid $750,000  Right  You had to put a new roof on it  The above ground pool collapsed  That cost you $3,000  To fucking sweep that up  You made $1,000  Over 30 years  Now you're 68  What are you going to take up  Water skiing?  It's fucking over  It's over  And then  Because they print the money  They cause inflation  You can't afford property tax  Then you got to sell it 
[03:41:30]  They move another 30 year old in  They bend him over  For fucking 30 years  That's what they're doing dude  Well you're not going to get  An argument out of me  About the banks being  Pieces of shit  I mean no  Who's  No one's arguing that point  But it's like  It's like  Generation after generation  Survives  I don't know why you think  It's all coming to an end  And we're all going to  Fall into the toilet  We eventually  Generation after generation  Survives  Saying that these fucks  Keep taking another slice  Out of everybody  As you keep continuing on  And they're getting richer  And we're getting poorer  That's not evolution Jim  That's 
[03:42:00]  They're creating an aristocracy  Us going to a global economy  Is a part of our evolution  It is  It's going to happen  Us going to a global  For evil purposes Jim  Not to help us  It's not always for evil purposes  So if we eventually branch out  And colonize the moon  And colonize one of Jupiter's moons  That's for evil purposes  Like where does it stop  When does our natural evolution  Take over  Or become a part of the theory  Jim I know nothing  About colonizing other planets  But it's not as crazy 
[03:42:30]  As you think  I just kind of read about  How do you have a war  With somebody  That you're sharing  A monetary  Like you're sharing  The same money  I'm not saying  You won't  Get another weapon  Like under Jimmy  Under Jimmy's  Thing here  Of one united  Earth  With a single  Denomination  Of currency  How do you then  Fight a war  Isn't there a conflict  Of interest  With the bank  Dude  With the bank  When you're fighting a war  Like  How do you divvy up the money 
[03:43:00]  If you look at something  Like the higher  Like  People have money  On both sides of wars  I don't know  Yeah  These are huge  Fucking questions  But all I know  Is that  You know  The direction  They're going in man  Is that  They're trying  They're trying  To get everybody  In the world  Underneath the thumb  Of that  Have one bank  Have everybody  In that mortgage  Ass fucking  And it's just  Continually going to  Get worse and worse  Who are the guys  Who are the fucking  Aristocracy here  Who is they  Who is they 
[03:43:30]  I just want to know  Who they are  Whoever  Whoever's behind  The Federal Reserve  Whoever  I mean the J.P. Morgans  The Rothschild families  I mean it's not  If you  Those are old  Like they've been  Around for forever  And  But you don't even  They don't even  Seem to have  The influence  That they used  To have  Have you read  Any stuff  You read that book  The Case against  The Federal Reserve  No no  I didn't read that  Just read up on that  Type of stuff  Dude believe me  I just know  These old families  I'm literally  One inch  Into this shit  And it makes  Way more sense  Than any crap  I see on TV  And I can't  Intelligently  Debate this thing 
[03:44:00]  Like all the way  Down to who the  Fuck is running  This shit  I don't  I don't fucking  Know  But like  When I read  Stuff like that  That makes way  More sense to me  Then they don't  Like us  Because they  Don't like freedom  They're just  Jealous  Or  Any of this  Bullshit  That they just  They just  Throw none of it  Or a politician  Who just stands there  I think it's time  To get America  Back to work  And everybody  Yay  It's like  Dude you're not  Saying anything  One of the greatest  Ways they control  People is with religion  Once religion goes 
[03:44:30]  And eventually  It will go  Once that goes  Then a tremendous  Element  Of our thinking  And our psyche  As beings  Changes  We'll always hate  People that are  Different from us  I don't know  We always will  Dude  I don't know  About that  How come  When there's a plane  It's a natural  State of humanity  You're absolutely right  At this point  Yes  You're probably right  At this point  Our stupid evolution  You're probably right  When there's a plane crash  In a country  Or an earthquake  Or something  The news has to report  How many Americans  Were killed  Yeah  Because you care more 
[03:45:00]  About them  Yes  Than you do  The indigenous people  Of whatever  Catastrophe happened  When I see  Bodies  Of people  In Asia  Laid out  From a typhoon  A hurricane  Whatever the hell  Happens  An earthquake  I don't care  As much  As I do  When I see  A natural disaster  Or a terrorist event  That killed Americans  And you see  American bodies  The news won't show  American dead people  As often as they'll show  Foreign dead people  And it's because  We don't have 
[03:45:30]  The caring  For those people  As we do  For our own people  And it's this  Concocted thing  We just made up  The borders  And everything  Yes  But there's a caring  There's a unity  That we have  That is ingrained  In us  As a people  We don't like  Different people  Is it ingrained  In us  Or is it trained  Is it like  I think it's instinctual  I think it's ingrained  In us  It has some kind  Of a thing  That was put in there  For protection 
[03:46:00]  You watch kids  Play in a sandbox  There's always  The alpha male  He's running shit  Yes  Kids get jealous  It's so primitive  They steal toys  Just like they used  To drag women in  It's a part of evolving  We are in a weird way  Talking about the same thing  That's not evolution  I'm saying either  Because you're still  Alpha male  You still want to grab women  And just fuck them  In the street  It's natural  But you can't  Evolution and stuff  It is  You still want to  It's just  You evolve  You change  I'm telling you  It happens  It's just a very  Fucking slow process  It's  We're not all talking 
[03:46:30]  The alpha male  Is not going to  Ever go away  Unless you did  Like a Planet of the Apes  Fucking surgery  On the side  Cut out his brain  Or unless evolution dictates  That you don't need  To be an alpha male  To survive  Unless we go to a point  Which we  It's again  You know  We're talking  So if women  Would just start  Fucking nerds  There would be no reason  To be the star  Of the football team  No but it all comes down  To provide  Do women really know  Like it's a biological thing  It's an evolutionary thing  How they fucking want  To get knocked up  By a certain age 
[03:47:00]  Because they got that clock  You know what I mean  It's all internal stuff  Do you think dogs  Will ever change  And cats  And fucking penguins  They already have  Where they'll  They'll all of a sudden  Start  Well that was due to  I don't know  Sharks  Sharks haven't changed  In 60 million years  So maybe we are at the end  But we've changed a lot  In X amount of years  That's what I'm saying  I don't know  But we really haven't  We  It's like Bill said  Getting a fucking  CD player  Instead of a Victrola  Is not evolution  It's technological advancement  Just from us 
[03:47:30]  Becoming more informed  On things  Through learning  Not evolution  Our brains did not  Get any smarter  Between the time  We were fucking  Carving arrowheads  And now  We just  Figured more shit out  And stored it  In our brains  That were the same  When we were cavemen  Okay maybe that's  Where the rest of the  Evolution comes from  Maybe it's not  This physical thing  Maybe it's mental  Or whatever it is  But then the hatred  Of other people  And other nationalities  And other races  Won't go away  And the alpha male  Thing won't go away  This is something  Ingrained in humanity 
[03:48:00]  That I can't believe  In 5,000  10,000  50,000  Fucking years  Is ever going to go away  Well if Europe  Can like each other  They don't  They fucking hate each other  But work together  He was saying that  Europe should love  They're united  In the hatred  Of the United States  Whatever they're united in  They are united  And we eventually  Won't look at it like  Oh he's different  Because he's this  Or he's different  Because he's that  You think the Germans  Like the French  Not really  They fucking hate them  As much as they did  During the war  But they're united  On a necessity  They're united  So they can have  The same currency 
[03:48:30]  So they can  Right  They have power  Amway scam  That's why  Amway scam  So where do you see us  In like say  2,000 years  Or 3,000 years  What do you see us  Being the same thing  Different borders  Same assholes  Running things  So what do you think  Happens when we discover  Life on another planet  Jimmy somebody is always  Going to want to fuck  Somebody's hot girlfriend  Yeah I know  I understand that  Do you know there are  People that have  An absolute belief  That there are  There is a life  A life on other planets  That still have  An unbelievable belief  In God and religion  And Christianity 
[03:49:00]  Meaning  So even if they  Discovered other life  They'd still fucking  Pray to their God  And  Well just to have  Us on Europe  That would go away  You think  Yes I do  Just to have people  On earth is an incredible  Waste of space  For the universe  What is the purpose  Of everything else  Everything has a purpose  Right  Supposedly  What the  Is that all  That other shit  To make us feel  How lucky we are  That's just us  It gives us this mystery  We need a mystery  So we can invent  This fake shit  That gives us this hope  That after you fucking  Electronic impulses 
[03:49:30]  Stop pulsing in your body  That there's something else  If we knew  You know  If we were in some  Walled fucking cage  That was the universe  And we knew everything  About it  We'd fucking  You'd shoot yourself  The second you were born  Why the fuck am I working  Why am I doing this  It's hope  That's what fucking  Human beings  Are on this world for  Is this hope  That something is  Going to get better  Eventually  Whether it's in this life  Or the next one  That we assume  There's going to be  Or we would sit around  And fuck all day 
[03:50:00]  Or smoke pot  Or do anything  There's just  We wouldn't do anything  It's to keep productive  The biggest thing  The biggest thing  That keeps people fighting  Is the idea of country  Yes  And the idea of religion  And I would say  Those are the two  Biggest things  That keep people  At each other's throats  Eventually  The idea of those things  Will go away  Land  Prosperity  That's part of country  To me  As opposed to being  One big unit  You know what  I bet like  Even when the world  Becomes one  We'll feel that 
[03:50:30]  South America  Or whatever  Whatever the fuck  They call it  Is getting treated  Better than us  There'll always be  There's always going to be  There'll always be  That 7th grade  Fucking jealousy thing  In between  Yeah  We're not  We're not digital  We're fucking analog  We can't fucking  Just distribute evenly  Anything  There are greedy people  There are people  Yes there are  And that  I can't see ever changing  A whole brand new species  Has to fucking come out  We can't evolve  From what we are  We need a whole new species 
[03:51:00]  To crawl out of the fucking muck  And go  You guys  Are so fucking outdated  Like the Neanderthals  And the Cro-Magnon  We need that to happen  We need our  Our new age Neanderthal  To come and treat us  Like douchebags  Cro-Magnon  Fucking kicked ass  On those big rigid  Eyebrowed  Stupid motherfucking  Neanderthals  Maybe the next  The next form of  Fucking evolution  For us then  Is with computers  Is it that crazy  Where we are  Like where you start  To think of something  You think of an impulse  And the fucking  Phony finger moves  Maybe that's 
[03:51:30]  Maybe that's the next  Phase of our evolution  Is somehow with  Computers  That's not  That's not evolution  Though  Sure it is  Some kind of  Biotechnical  Thing where we  Integrate technology  Into our physiology  Technological evolution  That's cool  Or genetic engineering  Where that can maybe  Advance our evolution  Somehow  Walking upright  Like shit like that  Is evolution buddy  Like I said  Going from a record player  To an iPod  Is not evolution  It's technological evolution  But now wait a minute  I just  I could still  Dude  Somebody from the 1800s  How well read they were  Back then  Because they didn't watch TV 
[03:52:00]  Could smoke me  In a fucking conversation  About a lot of stuff  Dude you read a letter  From like the Civil War  My dearest Penelope  As I sit here  Amongst the bodies  Of my kin  It's like this elegant  Fucking letter and shit  And we can't even  Send a letter anymore  It's all email  It's just  We don't even write  B-R-B  L-O-L  Right  Semicolon  Yeah yeah  Happy faces  Look did you see  My dearest Penelope  I saw  I shot a rebel today  L-O-L  I saw a guy 
[03:52:30]  Had a hilarious shirt  It said  You're retarded  And it was spelt  Y-O-U-R  You know  That's just something  You saw on YouTube  Yeah yeah yeah  You're retarded  By a genetic  I think genetic engineering  Is the way that  Our own brains  That we are capable  Of doing whatever  We're going to do with  Can affect our evolution  If we are able to  Eradicate certain diseases  Through genetic engineering  Grow limbs  Just do things  Affect our own bodies  Through our mind 
[03:53:00]  That's an odd  Kind of forced evolution  I think  That's the only way  It could happen  With any speed  I think  But I don't know  If you can eradicate  That natural  Hatred we have  For things  That are different  But look at the way  Maybe you can't  Eradicate certain instincts  Maybe those instincts  Or those primal things  Take so long  To go away  But like Bill said  About 1800s  You're right  But how about  Having an argument  With a guy  From 15,000 years ago  That guy 
[03:53:30]  Be easy  You get beat  He would fucking  Blast you in the head  With a rock  You're like  Hey we were talking  But look at the differences  In the way we are  In the way we look  At things now  And the way we look  At things then  We already have  A global  They say global  Phone thing  Which is the internet  We already have now  A completely global  Communication network  Which we didn't have  Except through  Separate phone systems  Look what's happened  In the last hundred  I don't see that  As evolution though  Yeah three days  Without food and water  Man you would  Revolve 
[03:54:00]  We'd be fucking  2001 A Space Odyssey  Looking at a monolith  Look at New Orleans  What part of your brain  Yes of course  We have to survive  I mean we are  The creatures that need  To eat and drink  New Orleans 80 year old  Diabetics waiting to be  Rescued on a bridge  No no  In the Superdome  Where it became  The Thunderdome  You know  That's basic evolution  That's exactly what you're saying  That also proves  My point  Wait is that  Ralphie Mays  Yeah it's Ralphie Mays 
[03:54:30]  I've been here for 30 minutes  How are you doing everybody  I actually been enjoying  The conversation  That proves my point  Of the disdain we have  For people that are different  For things that are different  For different cultures  Different ways  There is just  And the people that are  In charge now  Are of a certain ilk  And will be more sympathetic  To that ilk  If it's only a small group  Of people at the top  Then how come  In one hand  It's all evolution  Like we're all animals  Who will never get along 
[03:55:00]  Like so why does it have to be  A small group of the top  Control us  That is an animal  With too much fucking control  The alpha male  It's the same way  You take the average douchebag  Who's a nice guy  You make him a bouncer  You give him a little bit of power  He instantly becomes  A fucking cunt  When did these  When did these things happen  Like when did this  This group  That controls it all start  Well from what  They didn't keep  Genghis Khan on top  They didn't keep  The Romans on top  From what Bill said  And I haven't read the book  And Bill was talking about  But this old money  This old aristocracy 
[03:55:30]  These old blue bloods  That's been going on  For hundreds of years  These families  Now whether they have  Taken their power base  And they're using it  A little more clandestine  Than they used to  Because they used to be  Big names  Totally because  They understand  But they understand  They understand  That becoming famous  Is one of the stupidest  Things you can do  If you want any sort of power  So you think  The Rockefellers  Is still like  Have their hands  In as much shit  As they used to  Absolutely  It's the genius  Do you think  They just fell off  Then how come  The foreigners  Own every building  In New York City  Instead of the Rockefellers 
[03:56:00]  Can I tell you something  Do they own it  Who owns it  The bank owns it  And those guys  Are all paying  Fucking interest on it  Dude  It all comes back  To banks  They fucking own everything  They fucking own  They own all of it  So country means nothing  The fact that  China owns  And Japan owns  Buildings in New York  It's like  They don't own it  It's this bank  But what makes the banks  They own it  They own it free and clear  Well they can rent it out  They can do  No one owns anything  If they want to  Go that crazy  If they have the oil 
[03:56:30]  Don't they have the things  That kind of make  Dude it's not even your money  Like think of all the money  You've made in your life  How much you've actually  Held in your hand  It's a fucking number  On a piece of paper  You put it in a fucking bank  And then through penalties  And taxes  They can basically guide  Where the fuck  You're going to put it  That's why I'm in the stock market  I don't want to  I don't know a fucking thing about it  I just people  I'm just sitting in a bar  People  It's a good investment  It's a good investment  I can fucking stick it in there  Now I'm trying to pull it out  They're like  Yeah go ahead and pull it out  Watch how far that dick  Goes in your fucking ass  We're going to take it  No matter what  Just shut your mouth  And do what we say 
[03:57:00]  That is the vibe  That's not evolution  Dude it's an insane  Amount of fucking power  That has taken  And made major advancements  In the last like  Close to 30 years  I don't want to know who the they are though  I would love to know who they are  You're never going to know  You're never going to know  And people who sit there  And act like  Like that's fucking weird  That  Like dude  Do they know  Wait wait  Do you know  Who runs CBS  Do you know  Yes Les Moonves  Do they know  They're the they  Yes and above him  Sumner Redstone  Do they know  That they are the they 
[03:57:30]  Or is it just  The structure of power  That puts them  In that position  That they don't even know  That they are the they  You know what I mean  I don't know  All I know  Dude I just read  Like I don't know  I read this letter of regret  That Woodrow Wilson wrote  About being the guy  Who pushed the Federal Reserve Act  That's from a fucking  Standing president  Going wow  Did I just fuck this country up  It's not like  Conspiracy theory  And then people be like  Well how do you know  I wrote it  How the fuck do you know  You wrote it  It's just like  You probably did write it  The media would have  Put it on and crucified him  For changing his mind  On something 
[03:58:00]  Back in those days  Now they have advisors  That would say  Don't do that  You're crazy  I just look at what  Banks have done  And the amount of  Criticism they're getting  Versus these douchebag CEOs  Who I'm not defending  From the big three  These guys  Look at them  They're on fucking TV  Yeah they are  They're right now  Live  These guys are getting  Hung out to dry  Never happens with bankers  Where are all these  Fucking idiots  Where are they  Where are these  Weren't the guys  From Lehman Brothers  And Chase  Weren't a lot of those guys  Fucking called out  And blasted publicly  I mean a lot of these guys 
[03:58:30]  Were fucking  They're not going to jail  They need to get raped  I don't get to go with that  You need to go get raped  They just stole  Three quarters of a trillion  Three quarters of a trillion  Fucking dollars  From every taxpayer  In this country  They're supposed to use  That money to help us out  They fucking kept it  They kept it  And they bought  Other companies  They bought up  Other fucking banks  And nobody's giving  To get more debt  Nothing's fucking happened  But because bankers  Are scumbags  And they are scumbags  And they do control  The money  Because they know  The money better  Than any of us do  I don't think  That's a sign  That there's just  A couple of  Little teeny people 
[03:59:00]  At the top  Doing all of it  If human nature  Is greedy  And we're always  Going to hate each other  Well then it's  Going to  Pockets of this  Are going to pop up  All over the place  I don't believe  That's what I think  I'll definitely  Go along with that  But I also  People who don't  Like believe in  Secret societies  Or conspiracy theory  Like I don't understand  That on any  Fucking level  It's like you can't  Any sort of major  This country  Came about  Through a conspiracy  The revolutionary war  Didn't just  Spontaneously  Everybody's drinking beer  And then you just 
[03:59:30]  Started putting  Yeah but isn't  This odd thing  Going wow  These people  Were being persecuted  And they decided  To rebel  You're crazy  It's not  That wasn't a crazy idea  Of rebelling  Against a country  That was oppressing you  Yeah but you don't  Just have a revolution  You have to conspire  No you have to get  Into a room  And start talking to people  Yeah that's conspiring  But that's different  You don't think  That conspiracy  Has gotten a different  How do you think  England  See you live here  And it worked good for you  So you look  That was a revolution  England did not look  At that as a revolution  They looked at  As this is
