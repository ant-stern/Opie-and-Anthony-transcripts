<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a humorous discussion of a video depicting a woman heavily intoxicated from inhaling computer duster, repeatedly claiming to be "walking on sunshine."  Clips of the woman's behavior are played, followed by a caller, Bill, recounting Jimmy Norton's recent appearances on *Red Eye*, noting Norton's comedic style and the show's surprisingly tolerant attitude towards his jokes.  Another caller shares his teenage experience huffing gasoline.  The conversation then jumps to various news items: Ricky Martin and Clay Aiken having children via surrogates, Barack Obama's impoverished half-brother in Africa, the upcoming VP candidate selections, and the fashion choices of women in business suits.  Tangents include Anthony's dislike for his ex-wife, a yacht fire involving a friend, a plane crash in Madrid, and the Olympic games, particularly focusing on the attractiveness of a beach volleyball player.  Jimmy Norton is a guest in the studio throughout this segment, and he discusses his recently shaved mustache.

The show continues with the hosts mocking photos of women, followed by a discussion of Usain Bolt's Olympic performance, his showboating, and speculation about performance-enhancing drugs.  A caller, Tim, discusses the poor safety record of MD-80 airplanes.  The hosts compare photos of Sean Penn and Curry Walsh, noting a resemblance.  They debate sportsmanship and showboating across various sports, touching on racial differences in opinions on the matter.  A "Primetime Gossip" segment follows, mocking a crew member, "Stunt Brain," for his reliance on the internet for information.

The show revisits the computer duster abuser, Allison, with more audio and video clips.  The hosts and a caller who knew Allison discuss her behavior, speculating on its causes.  Technical issues with the initial airing of this segment are also addressed.  Further clips of Allison interacting with her mother and a friend are played.

A call-in segment focuses on relationships with significantly older women, with several callers sharing humorous and sexually suggestive anecdotes.  Guest David Tell participates in the discussion, contributing jokes and suggesting a reality TV show about older women dating younger men.  The segment ends with further discussion and visual depictions of older women, accompanied by humorous commentary on aging.


The broadcast continues with a caller recounting a relationship with his teenage school bus driver, leading to more listener anecdotes about age gaps in relationships.  The hosts and callers discuss the adult film series "Taboo," detailing scenes and cast members like K. Parker and Aunt Peg.  A significant portion is dedicated to a debate on the authenticity of a leaked Britney Spears audio recording.  Office staff opinions on the recording's legitimacy are discussed.  David Tell, promoting his Comedy Central appearances, is a guest throughout this section.  The conversation shifts to callers' memories of adult theaters and pornography consumption in their youth, featuring explicit descriptions of experiences and observations, including specific films and actors.  Mike DeStefano also joins the show, sharing anecdotes and engaging in banter.  The show concludes with further discussion of "Taboo" and an explicit commentary on clips from an old topless film.  The final segment speculates, with vulgar humor, about the future of the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM and contract negotiations.


The final excerpt involves a heavily sexually suggestive segment focusing on descriptions of topless dancers and showgirls from various locations (Tokyo, Copenhagen, Berlin, Paris, etc.), read from what seems to be vintage texts.  The descriptions are explicit and humorous, frequently interrupted by off-topic, equally vulgar comments and jokes.  The repeated phrase "throbbing guitar/bass" is notable.  The discussion includes comments on women's physical attributes, personal experiences with women, negative opinions on long-haired men, and commentary on celebrities (Chloris Leachman, Christine Applegate, Jane Mansfield).  There's a graphic discussion of Terri Schiavo and an anecdote about a man exposing himself in a coffee shop and being doused with boiling water.  Jimmy Norton, a guest throughout this segment, shares sexually charged and offensive anecdotes and jokes.  The show concludes with discussion of Norton's upcoming appearances and a final anecdote about glue sniffing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  Morning, people.  Phone's lit already.  What's up?  People want to talk.  We're not ready to talk.  About what?  We're not ready to talk to you yet.  We haven't even thrown a subject out there. 
[00:00:30]  We need a few minutes to ourselves just to kind of wake up.  Yeah.  And slowly get into this.  But they're ringing already, the phones.  Leave us alone.  We're trying to sleep.  Leave us alone.  877-212-ON-A.  I want to start with the Walking on Sunshine video we just saw.  Oh, God.  That woman was, wow, troubled, to say the least.  Troubled. 
[00:01:00]  It's one of my favorite shows, Intervention.  Yeah.  When I get to watch it, I kind of laugh at these people.  Yeah, a bunch of real screwed up people and their friends and family decide, hey, it's  time to get involved, so they get a hotel room, bamboozle the people with a problem into  coming into the hotel room, and there are the cameras and the family, and then the people  instantly know, uh-oh.  But in this day and age, how are you falling for that?  Because you're effed up on drugs. 
[00:01:30]  Because everyone, yeah, they get an intervention.  Well, we're doing a documentary on alcoholics.  Yeah.  Oh, they're not, you idiot.  It's an intervention.  They're coming to get you.  Run!  Run!  Yeah, I don't know.  They fool them into getting to the hotel, and the guys, they're meeting an old friend  sometimes, or, I don't know, they get them there, though, and once that door opens, then  they go like, oh, no, it's an intervention.  They're very gullible. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Their guard is down.  Surprise, surprise.  And I think intervention even knows that the whole, like, coke head, the alcohol, like,  it gets boring after that.  Old hat.  So they try to find, like, these real whack jobs.  Well, they got this one.  Man, this chick is a huffer.  She's huffing that computer cleaner.  Computer duster?  Yeah.  Which can be absolutely fatal.  Really? 
[00:02:30]  Uh, yeah, the first time you do it, you could just get really...  Not if you're looking at this Walking on Sunshine video.  Really screwed up.  She seems to do it quite often without, uh, without dying.  She says she's constantly doing it.  The buzz only lasts five minutes.  Um, she, uh, the only time she's not doing it is when she's going to buy more.  Uh.  Which she does a lot.  Constantly, yeah.  Yeah, she does, uh, what, ten of these cans a day? 
[00:03:00]  Ten cans a day.  At three dollars a pop.  And she just lays there, and, and it's not even like she puts it in a bag and inhales  it.  She puts the valve from the can right in her mouth and, and squeezes down on it and inhales  it in.  Yeah.  Right out of the can.  Yeah.  Is that bad for you?  I would think it's probably bad.  She looks, I've never seen anybody look higher.  No, I'm kidding.  She looks so high.  Well, who, who gets credit for the video? 
[00:03:30]  We, we, we take pride in, uh, turning you guys on to, you know, videos that maybe aren't  the, the ones everyone else is watching.  This one's a beauty.  It's called Walking on Sunshine.  Uh, Alberto found this one and sent it to me.  Alberto.  He said, you've got to see this.  So basically in this intervention, this, uh, woman in between like doing the, the, the,  the puffing of the computer duster, she goes, it's like walking on sunshine.  And then they start playing the walking on sunshine song. 
[00:04:00]  The, the old Katrina and the wave song.  As she's squirting this, uh, gas into her mouth and, and getting crazy eyes.  Yeah.  Is that the stuff that you used to keyboard clean?  Yes.  Right there.  There's some.  You want some?  Oh, wow.  Let's do some.  Want some Jimmy?  I don't use that for anything but cleaning.  Thank you.  How the hell do you find out that that stuff would get you high?  That's what I want to know.  How does the first person make that discovery?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  Teeth or dusty?  Wait a minute. 
[00:04:30]  That's a brave soul, right?  I'm going to try this.  I think this might get me high.  Ah, look at her.  She's buying a bunch of cans.  They have to know at the counter what she's doing.  Oh, that dusty girl again.  Ah, here she is.  Her computer must be very dusty.  What is she doing?  Lots of Cheetos while she types?  She must live in a dust bowl.  Yes.  I bet she has a problem with animal dander.  She must sleep under the bed.  Why does she?  She must have dust bunnies all over.  And there she is.  She gets like crazy eyes. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  It must be nice.  I was telling Anthony, it must be nice to just, you know, lay around in your pajamas all day long.  That must be a great life where you don't even have to put on jeans or nothing.  You just kind of lounge around in your pajamas and you're puffing away on this computer duster stuff.  So we're getting the audio.  All right.  We're going to link the video on onaradio.com, but it's hilarious when she just goes.  It's like walking on sunshine.  Wait till you hear her say this, Jimmy.  Wait.  You're going to love it. 
[00:05:30]  She looks like her mouth just smells because her lips are all red.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that stuff can't be good for you.  Her eyes are gone.  She should be running downstairs to talk to Mary Tyler Moore.  When you see it, she was pre-med.  This was a girl who was apparently very smart and on her way to some kind of life.  Yeah.  And this happened.  How long has she been doing the dust, the computer dust?  I think at least a couple of years.  But if you watch the whole episode, they do get her cleaned up.  No, it really pisses me off.  I think it was brought up in the office when we were watching the Walking on Sunshine video. 
[00:06:00]  She's doing the huffing on her couch and her mom's there like putting her pizza.  Yeah.  And enabling.  And enabling mom.  Mom.  Wouldn't you as a parent at that point just slap the stupid computer duster out of her hand?  Apparently, I hear she felt very guilty, the mother, because the daughter was sexually assaulted as a child.  Yeah.  And that might be why she's huffing. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, wow.  Trying to dust out her mouth.  Yeah.  Trying to dust out that chlorine.  Clean, clean, clean, clean.  Make me pure again.  Make me clean.  I can't get clean.  We're going to have that audio in a few minutes.  The boys are working on it.  But we've got some props for Jimmy coming in.  Let's say hi to Bill in Florida.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  Jimmy, I heard you on Fox News' Red Eye Show last night.  Oh.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Dude, crack me up, man.  Are you going to go on there again or not? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, they had me on twice a month.  They're very cool, man.  They're very good to me there.  I hope he came with you.  I didn't even go alone.  Yeah, I went to the taping last night.  They love Jimmy over there.  Do they edit any of that stuff out?  I don't.  Jimmy was saying some outrageous stuff, and I'm sitting there going, there's no effing  way Fox News is going to allow this on their air.  At night, they're allowed stuff.  You had a great Greg Louganis joke, and I'm like, oh, wow.  I wonder what that was about.  Well, they were talking about Michael Phelps and how Michael Phelps decided to go on the 
[00:07:30]  box of Frosted Flakes, right?  Frosted Flakes.  Instead of Wheaties.  And there's people outraged, going, ah, the kids, they're going to think that Frosted  Flakes is healthy for you.  Let me tell you, it's a lot tastier.  Right.  No one eats Wheaties, which I think was brought up on the show yesterday.  Everyone talks about being on the Wheaties box, but you can't find a person that actually  eats this stuff.  Wheaties stink.  Yes.  And a lot of...  The name stinks.  Wheaties.  Yeah.  Think about it. 
[00:08:00]  Wheat.  Right.  But these are Wheaties.  Wheaties.  It's fun wheat.  It's like action figures that are wheat.  They're terrible.  Yes.  Wheaties.  Can we take some of your lines from Red Eye and just replay them on our radio show?  That would be a good plug for the TV show.  Yes.  My cereal is weenies.  And it starts.  Yeah, of course it does.  Of course it does.  I'm sitting on sunshine.  He's the person I've met.  Steve, what do you think of that? 
[00:08:30]  No, no, no.  Not this early.  Please, guys.  I'm doing Steve.  Okay, good.  I'm doing Steve's improv.  Steve, what do you think of sunshine?  I like brightness.  That's why I don't talk.  Yeah, we get it.  Yeah, at night I think you're allowed to get away with it more.  I mean, first of all, they're cable.  They're not regulated by the FCC.  They're all self-regulate.  But at night, it airs at midnight west coast.  I think three in the morning here.  Oh, then please.  Yeah.  Where are the children?  They got a nice vibe and the host seems pretty cool. 
[00:09:00]  We got to get them on the show.  Yeah, they love this show.  What's his name?  Greg something?  Greg Gutfeld.  Yeah.  Greg.  Yeah, he likes to laugh and likes to have a good time.  He's a good host.  And Jimmy just kills.  Oh, thanks, man.  You're a big get for that show, man.  I mean, he's kind of funny.  I've done it many times.  I got the vibe down.  Because at first, it's kind of hard.  Because it moves pretty quickly.  Like, from first, he tries to keep everybody involved.  Yeah.  No, he seems to.  Why don't you do it if you should?  He seems to really, really love you.  Actually, a couple pictures I took last night are up on onaradio.com. 
[00:09:30]  Ooh.  You can check those out.  Uh, last appearance of the stache?  You don't have your mustache today!  No, look, it's gone.  I told you to keep it!  How do you not notice that?  I go to Jimmy on the way home from Red Eye last night.  He goes, I'm going to shave the mustache.  I'm like, if you went on TV with the mustache, why can't you, like, humor us and come into  the radio show with the mustache one more day so I could get another picture of it?  Couldn't do it.  I started to trim it a little bit, and it just got, like, a little too weird.  I'm like, eh, start over.  I'll start over.  I went with the old Adolf. 
[00:10:00]  No, I couldn't do that.  It's always fun.  No, we're, I told him to do the reverse Adolf like, uh, Merle did.  I think his name was Merle, right?  Merle from, uh, Gigi Allen.  Oh, right.  But I started shaving it just to trim it, because it was, it was much more on one side.  Uh-huh.  And it was, like, way, it was hurting to shave, like, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, because  it was, like, long hair.  Yeah.  It was, like, long hair out of your face.  No, I know.  And, uh, that's a good...  That's why you need, like, an electric shaver to...  That's what I was getting used.  You need the groomsman.  And what was funny was, um, Jimmy shows up, and, you know, there's the other, uh, the 
[00:10:30]  other panel members, and you got the makeup artists, and you got producers and directors,  and Jimmy looks at me, he goes, no one has noticed that I got this awful mustache.  No one will tease me.  Not, I think they want to make believe they're not seeing this awful mustache on his face.  And then, then, Greg, the host, comes in and just openly laughs, and Jimmy goes, finally,  someone gets it.  Nobody would...  They won't try to be polite.  Right.  He walked in and laughed at my stupid face.  They kind of respected him.  You were a prop comic for, like, a week.  I really was. 
[00:11:00]  I had blueberries in my mouth.  Let's go to, uh, Matt in Georgia.  Matt, how's the war going?  What's up, boys?  Yeah, the, uh, the Russians, uh, said they're pulling out, but, um...  Not fast enough.  They're still there?  Matt?  Yeah, are the Russians still there?  Yeah, there's bombs going off all over the place, man.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What part of Georgia are you in?  Uh, northeast, Georgia.  I'm actually driving to Atlanta right now.  Oh, yeah.  We have an Atlanta in...  Russian tanks.  We have an Atlanta in the United States as well, which is very strange. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, in our Georgia.  In our Georgia.  So, hang in there.  Yeah.  Watch out for the Russian tanks.  What do you got today there, Matt?  Yeah, when I was younger, me and my friends, uh, we decided that we'd steal a five-gallon  thing of gas, and we'd huff it.  Yeah.  And we got, uh...  We went out to a football field and decided to start huffing this gas, and it basically...  I passed out like six different times, and you hear all these different voices, and the  one voice I remember hearing was over and over again, hey, did you just get laid? 
[00:12:00]  Over and over again, and then the cops decided to jump the wall, and this was when I was  14, and we got in all kinds of trouble for it.  Over some stupid gas that one of my, like, younger friends said it was a cool thing to  do.  He's trying to keep the story.  I lost you so long ago, I can't even tell you.  I got as far as gas.  Yeah.  Thank you, Matt.  There's a movie with Philip Seymour Hoppin, which I think he wrote and directed called Love 
[00:12:30]  Liza, which is a...  It's not a great movie.  He's great, but it's boring, the story.  But it's about a guy whose wife has committed suicide, and the whole movie is him trying  to get the courage to read the note that she left him.  It's a great concept.  It was kind of depressing.  Yeah.  And in it, he huffs gas.  He becomes like this...  He's like...  Look how frumpy he is.  And he starts huffing gas with local teenagers.  And it's depressing, but it's kind of funny.  His wife is dead, and he's just got a can of gas. 
[00:13:00]  Where does the huffing begin, by the way?  I don't know.  I mean, I did a few Whippets back in the day.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's kind of where it started.  I guess you move on from Whippets, because that gets boring.  Because it is kind of boring.  Whippets is just nitrous oxide.  Yeah, it gives you a quick little...  A little laughing gas.  A quick little thing.  I did that a few times, and I was like, all right, whatever.  This is boring.  Back to the cake party.  What were the Whipped Cream Companies thinking anyway?  I don't know.  What was Ready Whipped thinking?  Let's use a propellant.  What can we use?  Let's use laughing gas. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Yeah, the kids won't even think about inhaling this stuff.  No.  Oh, glue.  Yeah, sniffing glue.  All right.  Now, that I remember even growing up.  No, I never did it.  But that I remember in school was like a big thing.  Like when the cops would come to your school and talk about drugs.  They would talk about pills and pot and sniffing glue.  Sure, sniffing glue might sound like a good idea.  But then you start putting babies in microwaves. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Putting the glue in the bag.  It happens.  It happens.  It had to be rubber cement.  Elmer's doesn't work.  It just smells funny.  I never did that, though.  Never huffed.  Well, that picture of the mug shot that Danny just put up is real funny.  They arrested this guy.  He's got gold spray paint all around his mouth. 
[00:14:30]  What?  He was huffing?  He was, yeah.  Gold spray paint?  Yeah.  They put it in a bag.  They spray it in a bag and then put it up to their face.  And the next scene, you see Iron Man shuffling out with his pants around his ankles.  Wow.  This guy looks like he was doing something else and the other participant had an accident.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't get that whole huffing thing. 
[00:15:00]  Just buy some weed or something.  I did it when I was a kid with the stuff that's like a...  I think...  It's not poppers, but it's like an airplane glue or something like that.  Ooh.  A little glass bottle.  And it gives you a really nasty rush.  Really?  It was like sniff...  That type of feeling.  Your whole head is just like...  And buzzing?  Yeah.  It's your brain cells popping, probably.  You get a bad headache after, too.  You're going to get a five-minute high.  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, the phone's lit. 
[00:15:30]  We're not taking any phone calls from friends dying from huffing.  It's too depressing.  Not going into a goddamn death dedication.  Obviously, people die from doing this stuff.  But the Walking on Sunshine video, which is going to be up on onaradio.com, and we'll  have some audio clips.  Hilarious.  It's there.  Oh, it's already there for your viewing pleasure?  Hilarious.  We'll have a couple clips for the radio show, too, because this woman makes me laugh really  hard.  I don't really give a crap what happens to her. 
[00:16:00]  She's just a mess, and it's fun to look at.  A true disaster.  Absolutely.  Hi, E-Rock.  Hello.  Hey.  E-Rock just came in with something.  Someone's back out to her quickly.  I like the hustle, kid.  What do you got?  Just two quick clips of her?  That's all we're doing?  The rest is coming.  Oh, the rest?  All right.  We'll give them a taste.  A little taste, and then we'll have more after the break.  But this is Allison, who, what, huffs the computer duster 10 cans a day.  Wow.  What did he try to do a remix? 
[00:16:30]  I think that's from the clip.  Really?  Yeah.  I watched that whole video, and I don't remember that part. 
[00:17:00]  I really don't either, but whatever.  And that sniffing you hear is Allison.  We didn't put that in the clip.  But she goes, I'm walking on sunshine, and then the next sound you hear is...  She's spraying it in her mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She did 10 cans a day? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she was just laying around in her PJs, playing with her cats, just doing this over  and over and over again.  How annoying is it when you go to buy some computer duster stuff and you can't find it?  It's gone because this creep has to inhale it.  Yeah.  I have to get, like, bagel chip shavings in my computer keys.  She can't get off the dope.  How much attention do you need?  Some tells me Jimmy Norton's probably got to spray out the potato flakes.  He leaves it in here.  Yeah, spray out the potato flakes. 
[00:18:00]  Easy.  How much attention do you need, though?  That's such an attention thing.  And then you as, like, a sibling.  Ugh.  You have to be there for the person.  Go away.  Kill yourself.  It's all the same.  I care so much about it.  Do you understand you're dying?  You're killing yourself?  Yeah, you've got to play that role.  Ugh.  Please.  I feel sorry for anyone that has to play that role.  Because deep down you're like, oh, just kill yourself. 
[00:18:30]  Enough.  Enough already.  Well, guess who's in the hospital again?  All right.  She's starting her courageous battle.  I guess it's my turn to go to the ER.  I'll be right there.  Inconvenece themselves.  Oh.  Plans.  I'm not a fan of that, man.  And then the rest of her life she's got to spend with a filthy computer keyboard.  Because she can't be around any of that stuff.  Right.  She'll have to take a napkin and curl the edge of it. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Dip it in water and then clean it individually.  And then go in between each key.  That's what you get, junkie.  Just to go old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love those.  Whoever invented those, by the way, really deserves just something.  I don't know what they deserve.  It's too early.  It's too early, but they deserve something.  A commendation of sorts.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  877-212-O-N-A.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Good morning. 
[00:19:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're just joining us, some late, some late what?  Risers?  Late.  Uh, yeah.  Whatever.  It's a weird day in the news, man.  Ricky Martin had twins?  What?  Really?  What?  What is that about?  So the three of them are in bed. 
[00:20:00]  And it's the only way that could work.  Literally the old turkey baster.  Yeah.  He, uh, became a father of twins from a surrogate mother.  What is that about?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, surrogate mother.  I was right with turkey baster.  Yeah.  Surrogate mother.  Why can't people just say it?  It's so obvious what's going on here.  What?  I don't know what you mean. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, you say you get sued for a lot of money.  Do you?  I think so.  What is going on with...  And then Clay Aiken had a...  What?  People do bring these gentlemen's sexuality into question.  I didn't say anything.  The fact that they have babies is a little odd.  Throws, uh, throws people off the scent.  The scent.  You start smelling Moe.  And you're like, hmm.  Well, I guess I was wrong.  He, uh, he had twins.  Oh, well. 
[00:21:00]  Nothing to see here.  We'll move on.  Wait, is this...  Is this giving...  Could you put the...  Play that song again, Danny, for one second?  Ooh, dang, dang.  This is...  Oh, you can't really say anything.  Uh-huh.  But you can tell...  Oh, this is a good song!  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  There you go.  That's all right.  Yeah, that really is just...  That's a little mating call, that song.  Oh, true.  Oof.  So he became a father of twins, and he's going to take a year off to kind of raise his,  uh, his, uh, his, uh, I don't know if there are two boys or one of each.  I have no idea.  Two boys.  A year off?  What's he been doing? 
[00:21:30]  I haven't seen Ricky Martin in...  Yeah, really.  I think he's still famous somewhere, like in the Latino countries or something.  I don't know.  I heard he lives in the Time Warner building.  Maybe we'll bump into Ricky.  Congratulations on the babies.  And then Clay Aiken, you know, with a 50-year-old or something?  What?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Clay Aiken decided to have a kid with a 50-something-year-old woman or...  Does he really think that's going to throw us off?  And why?  Out here in the suspicious world?  We're suspicious.  Let's just say you're a guy and you don't like, uh, women. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Uh, you prefer, uh, the company of gentlemen, but you want to have a child.  Why would you pick a woman that is not in her childbearing years?  I don't know.  You know?  What does he want?  A little, uh...  I don't even know if he...  A little mongoloid?  I would say that some of these people don't even want the child.  Really?  They want to make sure their career continues.  Oh, so you're thinking that just throws people off the scent, like you say.  I think for some people, yeah, that's what they do. 
[00:22:30]  And maybe others, yeah, sure, this is a way of having kids, even though you're not into the, uh, the, quote, normal lifestyle.  Yeah.  Of a man and a woman and, uh, and, you know, having a kid.  So you're thinking, like, a lot of these Midwestern rubes wouldn't like him if they found out he was, uh...  Well, I don't know in his case, but I think it's something that, uh, some of these Hollywood types consider, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Mm-hmm.  You had, uh...  But then you get, uh, people like, uh, Ellen DeGeneres going, ah, screw, uh, the Midwest rubes. 
[00:23:00]  I'm, I'm doing this.  Yeah, well, everybody knew, you know, when she came out.  Yeah.  It didn't seem to affect her, though.  She is such the man in that relationship.  We saw the picture yesterday.  Oh, she married a Porsche de Rossi.  Who had, uh, a fine wedding gown on.  Yeah, she had...  She was just like a...  A bride.  Looking like a really hot bride until you see what she's holding on to.  She is holding on to Ellen DeGeneres' hand, and Ellen is wearing man clothes. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  At these, at these lesbian weddings, one of them's always got to be the dude.  And you knew in that relationship it was going to be Ellen.  So why does it have to be, like, uh, why can't they both be in wedding dresses?  Yeah.  You're, you're, you're chicks.  Because in, I guess, in these relationships...  I'm all confused about this stuff.  One is the guy.  Yeah, but, but then it's a guy-girl relationship.  Yeah, without any of that pesky genitalia to get in the way. 
[00:24:00]  Right, to get in the way.  But, I like to think that they're both in, you know, hot, uh, freaking wedding gowns.  And the honeymoon is nothing but scissoring.  A weird little scissor move.  Do you, do you pack the special belt for the honeymoon?  Yeah.  What kind of goodies are you pulling out of your honeymoon bag?  All right.  This clip goes here.  This strap and buckle.  How do you work this thing?  Mmm.  Mmm.  And then, um, then you got Obama's half-brother. 
[00:24:30]  This story is just amazing.  This is, uh, this started, uh, breaking, I guess, uh, late yesterday.  But, uh, they're finding Obama siblings all over the world, it looks like, no?  Maybe not all over the world, but certainly in Africa.  Outside Nai, uh, Nairobi?  Nairobi.  Uh, they found Obama's half-brother.  He lives like a recluse.  His name's George Obama.  And how much does he live on? 
[00:25:00]  A dollar a day or something?  A dollar a month.  A dollar a month!  I'm George Obama.  I'm your density.  I think from inside.  Yes, George Obama.  Uh, Barack Obama wants to live in the White House.  Here we go with the hacky, uh, lining.  Oh, no.  But his youngest half-brother lives in the poorhouse.  Ah!  Ho-ho!  This is really, really going to, uh, rally the Midwest behind Obama when they show his 
[00:25:30]  jungle brother pretty much in a hut in a country that apparently, uh, during the elections, people  get hacked apart with machetes.  He's, that's always a nice part of town.  He lives in a little tin shanty.  What, is Obama supposed to bring all these half-siblings to the United States?  Um.  He probably doesn't even know these people.  He doesn't.  He met, he met him twice.  Once when he was a child.  And another time back in, I believe, 2006 when, uh, Obama was visiting Africa. 
[00:26:00]  Uh, so they talked for a couple of minutes, uh, and it was like talking to a complete stranger.  Uh-huh.  That's what, uh, George Obama was saying.  Well, because he is a complete stranger.  Yeah.  So, how did this come about?  His father had another wife, or the wife had another?  Uh, it seems like the father, uh, ran around a bit.  The father ran around a bit.  Eh!  Yeah?  And it was a different mother.  Uh-huh.  Um, and, uh, this guy just, he lives on a dollar a month.  Which could be good if Obama just brings him on board as like an economic advisor. 
[00:26:30]  Imagine a dollar a month.  What the hell is he doing with a dollar a month?  I want to go to this place and buy a thousand vacation homes.  Live like a king in your tin shack.  Who actually collects that rent?  It's not a dollar, please.  I don't have it.  I don't have it.  I don't have it.  I'm Ted Obama.  I only have 78 cents. 
[00:27:00]  It's been a tough December.  So, uh, I'm sure the Republicans are loving this one today.  And McCain has a lead now, right?  Yeah, McCain, uh, going up in the polls, Obama kind of taking a little dip, uh, speculating  that, uh, he might get a little more momentum once, uh, he announces his running mate, who  everyone is still saying is Joe Biden, but Joe Biden is, is denying this saying, no, well, 
[00:27:30]  you got to deny it until the official announcement.  Doesn't that make you a liar?  Like if, if they announced that it's Joe Biden and he goes, I am the vice presidential candidate,  blah, blah, blah.  Then you turn around and go, he was lying when he said, I haven't spoken to anyone.  I don't know anything.  I'm not the guy.  Then you got to call him a liar.  I think the vice presidency in this case is very important.  Oh, yes.  You got one old guy. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  And then you got one guy that, uh, people are going to be, um, uh, thinking maybe the  vice president is going to be very important for just in case anything happens.  I don't remember in past elections, like the, you know, uh, paying attention to who they  were picking for the VP for the most part.  Yeah.  Except for that, that, that lovely man, uh, uh, Stock.  Stockdale.  Stockdale.  Stockdale.  Why am I here?  Who am I?  Who am I here?  It's a question, not a comment.  But it seems very important this time around who the VP is going to be. 
[00:28:30]  I'll tell you why I think he should go with John Kerry.  Uh, cause Hillary, I just don't think, uh, look, it's, it's too different.  This country has never had anything but white guys.  It's just too different of, of picture of a black president and a female vice president.  That's reality.  But John Kerry's dirt has also all been uncovered when he was running for election.  Everything he has to come out came out.  What are they going to hit him with?  That, that hasn't been on.  Yeah.  It'll be like, ho hum.  Yeah.  This war record again.  It's not a big deal.  No one cares. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  But it's also ho hum for him.  He's dull.  He is a dullard.  He's got no charisma.  I don't know.  And again, like you were saying, the whole politics, business as usual thing.  Obama has just been talking about this big change and how he got to, uh, uh, change the  way Washington works and change this.  And then he just goes and gets some politician.  I don't know.  So you might have to go with some young white guy.  Now I understand the change, uh, slogan, by the way. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  He's talking about his, uh, half brothers and sisters.  Oh.  They need change.  They need change.  For rent.  I'm talking change.  Now it all makes sense.  Obama for change.  See, he's just collecting, you know, he's actually trying to help his family in Nairobi.  We should audit George Obama.  Oh, boy.  Hey, we've noticed you haven't paid taxes in the last 10 years.  Oh, no.  You owe us $5 at 89 cents. 
[00:30:00]  I'm broke.  Oh, wow.  Dollar a month.  Dollar a month.  That's, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  I don't think, uh, that works well, though.  I think, uh, it's been on all, in all the newspapers.  I'm sure the news picks up on it.  And people look and go, all right, there's a, there's a tie between these two people.  You know, there's, uh, Obama, the presidential candidate and Obama, the, uh, dollar a month  broke African guy.  And, but they're linked together by a common dad. 
[00:30:30]  Uh, so people kind of look and go, ooh, ooh, I don't know if it'll matter.  Yeah?  Yeah, we, they, don't figure, you know, Clinton's dad was a, apparently abusive guy and alcoholic  and, uh, or stepdad was, whatever it was.  Uh, there was, who was it, Carter's brother?  Carter's brother was a raging alcoholic.  Yeah, but I'm, I'm talking race here.  I'm just talking race.  Whitey gets a little scared of stuff like that.  Well.  You know, it's hard enough for Obama to come across, uh, as a, a, a guy that, uh, can be 
[00:31:00]  embraced and accepted by a whitey, but, uh, he's done a great job of doing that.  But it's like, it's a very, very fragile relationship.  And anytime they throw something like this in or something like his pastor or something  like, you know, something racial, um, wow.  Why do you get scared?  The polls take a dip.  What about Mitt Romney?  Mm.  For, um.  McCain, right? 
[00:31:30]  McCain, yeah.  That's a biggie.  That's a good choice, right?  That could be.  A little moderate Republican.  When are they going to decide?  Next week?  I don't know.  They keep saying they're going to announce.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Stump and comment.  Obama's going to do it, I think, uh, late today or tomorrow.  And you sign up for an email, uh, text message.  I heard about that.  I know.  It's genius.  It's not genius.  It's stupid.  Well, he's getting a huge database.  That's a, for me, that was genius on his.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  You know, and stocking up on the names, and then he could mail out or do whatever he wants.  He can hit his base at any time, but Obama will announce before Saturday, and McCain 
[00:32:00]  said he's going to do it on his birthday.  Stump brain is such a bore that he studies this stuff.  I love it.  Who do you think?  I think Obama is going to go with, I still think it's Catherine Sebelius, the governor  of Kansas.  That is, um, ridiculous.  What?  Obama's going to, what?  Catherine Sebelius, the governor of Kansas.  Why wouldn't, if he's going to pick a woman, why wouldn't we just do the Hillary thing?  Hillary's too, uh, too radical for a lot of people, and they don't get along.  Yeah, that's true.  Now, Nader says it's going to be Hillary. 
[00:32:30]  He flat out was on TV yesterday saying it's going to be Hillary because he can give him  more votes.  Who's this Catherine Broad?  She's a governor of Kansas who's loved by a lot of people in the middle, and that's what  Obama needs is more of this central stuff.  Wow, that's a death sentence for Obama's campaign, and I don't know nothing about politics.  It's just a fine feel I have.  He's casting for a bad action movie, like a bad earth disaster movie.  You got the black president, the woman vice president.  Yeah, he did spend yesterday with that guy, Cain. 
[00:33:00]  Why doesn't he pick Will Smith at this point?  That would be good, actually.  He was with Tim Cain of Virginia yesterday, the guy who's kind of a bland...  This chick?  Yeah, that's Sebelius.  We'll put her picture up on onaradio.com.  That's my gut, but the leaders are her and Cain, and they're still saying Biden, but I don't  see that either.  He's just not telling anyone she's a woman.  I don't know.  Yeah, right?  Make her nod a lot.  Gym teacher.  Old Jay Leno hair.  They're talking about two people seriously now for McCain, and that is Tom Ridge, the 
[00:33:30]  Homeland Security guy, and the one we've been talking about, Mitt Romney.  Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What is Obama doing?  I agree.  He needs a name, man.  No one knows that this broad on the East Coast.  You may not need her to be known.  You may want the heartland.  He's so well known across the country.  He may just need to win some of the red states.  Anyone else notice that they haven't figured out the women business suit? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, I know.  Like, women who are, like, high up in companies, they just haven't figured out how they're  supposed to dress.  The pants suit.  It's the same thing.  They wear the same, like, outfit.  It's an awful look.  It's those pants.  Like, they're trying to compete with the business suit, and it just falls short every time.  We were doing the little walkover yesterday when we were going over to XM, or SiriusXM,  excuse me.  We were doing our walkover, and I saw this young woman, and she's walking, and she looked 
[00:34:30]  very attractive, looked like she probably had a nice body on her, but she was wearing  this abysmal business suit that just flattened her ass out, showed none of her upper attributes,  and it just covers everything up.  And the material's just awful.  It was like tweed or something, and it's warm out.  She's wearing tweed.  Ever have to remove a pantsuit? 
[00:35:00]  Never.  Me either.  I was just asking.  Just buttons and clips and zippers.  Let me take those smart slacks off.  You remove the pantsuit, hoping to get to the goodness, and there's never any goodness.  There's something, a vest under it.  She's wearing a vest.  Wear a pantyhose.  Oh, yeah.  Pantyhose with some kind of a tummy shield to hold in her tummy. 
[00:35:30]  We do politics like no one else out there.  We're brilliant at this stuff.  Pantyhose stink.  They're terrible.  Literally.  They just stink.  Oh, yeah.  There's no way you're sweating them.  All day long.  Ladies are just sitting in their cubicle wearing their pantyhose.  They might kick their shoes off under the desk, but the seams on the tips of the feet on  those pantyhose, P.U.  All right.  Guys, we have pantyhose fetishes. 
[00:36:00]  I don't get it.  I like thigh highs.  We all do, I think, guys, right?  I like leg warmers.  You've worn thigh highs?  No, I like them on a girl.  Oh, you scared me.  You've worn.  Jesus.  I'm like, what is that?  Hey, really fast before we move on.  And now it's coming out that that kid is John Edwards' kid.  Oh, yeah.  With that bimbo.  John Edwards, a naughty boy.  I understand, like, you know, people are going to cheat and all that. 
[00:36:30]  And here you are.  You're so close to, A, being the president of the United States of America.  Let's remember, he was one of the guys that people were like, well, maybe it's going to be Edward.  And then, you know, obviously he wasn't going to be the president.  But then he was being considered for possibly the vice presidency.  And he's spilling poison, let's just call it, all over the place.  Why wouldn't you, like, at least make sure the poison is contained?  I don't get that.  He bangs the way I would.  Right.  You should be thinking of other things. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you're a comedian, on the other hand.  And he's, you know, a politician that's looking to be.  How do you do that?  You're in politics.  Your whole career has been based since probably early in your schooling has been based on becoming a politician.  Part of which is keeping your reputation intact.  So how do you do that, like, Elliot Spitzer and, like, and just throw your career away?  Because that's pretty much a career ender when you're doing stuff like that. 
[00:37:30]  Hookers or getting some woman pregnant while you're married.  That's a career ending episode.  Look, the guy wanted to get a piece.  All right.  But why are you taking that chance?  Yeah.  Because not only, I mean, his political career's over.  It's over.  What is he going to do now?  Yeah.  Done.  Politicians, it's a weird thing.  You've got to, and they all seem to have these skeletons in their closet.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you open it up during the election time, and boy, the things that come spilling out. 
[00:38:00]  Well, because they're all obsessed with the power, which means.  Once they get the power.  Which means they need.  That's when they get the woman.  Which means they need something going on behind closed doors, because they're powerful out  in the real world.  So behind closed doors, they need someone else to teach them a lesson.  So you think they don't like going home maybe to a wife?  That might give them a little crap?  I don't know.  You think they like the power that much where they can't even, you know, at home, you wield 
[00:38:30]  all this power at work.  You get home, and it's like, take out the garbage.  Like, ugh.  I'm going to go screw something.  I know, uh, you use that one a lot.  I really wonder if, like, there are wives out there saying, take out the garbage still.  Yeah, there are.  I know mine did.  Yours did?  That was my job.  That and to vacuum the living room.  Here we go again.  I'm a radio star.  Shove it. 
[00:39:00]  God, was that annoying.  You had chores?  I had chores.  Oh, wow.  I only ask a couple of things.  Yeah?  Did you ever tell her, well, what are you doing during the day while I'm being a radio star?  Exactly.  You didn't, did you?  No.  Yeah, of course not.  Get beat up.  Something.  I don't know.  No, it was, um...  And Anthony definitely had to do vacuuming.  Why did you have to vacuum?  Because there were four cats in the house.  But why would you have to vacuum?  Or it wasn't my choice.  Was that her idea of splitting the chores up? 
[00:39:30]  Like, we both do chores.  Yeah, I would vacuum.  I also had to clean out the cat box.  Ugh.  I, I, yeah.  You're not a, I mean, you like cats when they're around, but...  I hate what they do.  But you're not like a cat lover where you're...  No.  ...running around trying to find cats and stuff.  No.  I had one of those, I had two of those machines going.  You know, the ones that automatically clean the litter, the, the, the litter that cleans  the, the, the crap out and puts it in a bag. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, it rakes across the, the, the cat litter.  Yeah, it rakes across at all hours with four cats.  It was like I was at a cat poopy processing plant.  I was running out of my house.  You should have huffed the...  You should have huffed the cat poop.  Huff it.  And got out of that relationship way before you did.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, what do you miss about your ex-wife?  There's got to be one thing.  I know there's...  My money.  My miss.  There it is. 
[00:40:30]  Do you have any fond memories of her?  Like, can you look back?  Is there any times you'll catch yourself thinking of her and go like, ah, that was nice.  Like, just in daydreaming or during the day?  You know something?  I'm actually thinking and I can, I can honestly say no.  Really?  No.  No.  I love Anthony.  Yeah, there it is.  Thank you, Danny, for the memory.  That's the mechanical cat box.  That I was hoping to open up one day and just see all the cats in the bag dead. 
[00:41:00]  Take them out.  Just shredded from the mechanism.  Back then, Ant and I were, like, still friends and I was around a lot.  And I never, yeah, I never saw, like, happiness for the most part.  Oh, no.  That's why I was so addicted to video gaming.  He was always fleeing to other things to just, you know, make it go away.  Make it go away.  Are you coming to bed anytime soon?  No.  I just want to get through the next 48 levels. 
[00:41:30]  I'll be right up when I'm done.  Why would she ask if you're coming to bed anytime soon?  Uh, I don't know.  Because it was time.  Maybe it was candle.  Sexy time?  Maybe it was candle night.  It was sexy time?  Maybe it was sexy time?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, play the video games.  Very nice.  What would you imagine as she's yelling down the stairs to you?  Are you coming to bed anytime soon?  I would imagine that Gordon Freeman had to make it to the nuclear test facility. 
[00:42:00]  Sure, of course.  Half-life.  And watch out for the headcrabs.  Yeah, well, yeah.  That's all I was thinking.  And what do you think was going on upstairs?  A lot of the stomping of the feet while she had some kind of piece of lingerie on and candles lit.  Maybe some anger.  And then I'd come upstairs and just, I don't know, throw on Nick at night, watch a little Dick Van Dyke.  Oh, just not a happy camper during that whole episode. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Hey, we've got to take a break, but we're learning more about this.  Governor of Kansas?  Yes.  Governor of Kansas.  Yeah, I've gotten that.  Kathleen?  Kathleen.  Kathleen.  All right, Trucker Dan, what's up?  I want to say good morning, by the way, to all the truckers.  We don't acknowledge them enough.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, thanks, man.  Yeah, hey, not many people have heard about this governor, but I've seen, I've heard about this bill she passed.  There's this doctor named, abortionist named Hiller, and they call him Hiller, the baby killer. 
[00:43:00]  The baby killer.  You don't want your name to rhyme with killer when you're doing abortions.  No, not at all.  Which makes for an easy sign.  You bet it does.  Well, it's one thing, you know, the woman's right to choose, but she passed this radical bill that will allow a doctor to abort a baby all the way up to nine months if she feels like she's mentally having issues with it, even. 
[00:43:30]  Like, I mean, it's up to nine months.  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  Yes.  Come on.  You just wait.  I don't.  Wait and find out.  I don't buy that.  I don't buy that.  Yeah.  No one would get elected.  That's called a cesarean section.  Yeah, that's called giving birth, you dummy.  Right.  She wants to be able to give abortions up until third grade.  Wait and see.  Wait and see.  All right.  You'll hear about it.  Hey, we got the fastest guy on a keyboard.  He likes to be called Stunt Brain, but we know he's just good with the keyboard. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, when the internet went down yesterday, so did Stunt Brain.  Oh, yeah, he did.  That was it.  That's his name's Hiller, the baby killer, and he will abort a baby up to nine months.  All right, Dan.  Up to nine months.  All right, Dan.  You're so – that's ridiculous.  It's completely illegal.  It's – God.  Stunt Brain yesterday, it was funny.  It was like watching the end of Flowers for Algernon.  There's nothing brainy about you, we've realized. 
[00:44:30]  Speed fingers.  Stunt processor.  You're good with the Google.  You're a good Googler.  The guy's talking about third trimester abortions, and I'll bet that she passed some radical  thing that said if the kid is some kind of disastrous mess, it's a third trimester thing.  It's a nine-month abortion because the lady's having issues.  All right, Stunt Brain is coming over with a microphone.  I've got Dr. Tiller's website.  And he –  Tiller the baby killer? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  Dot com, right?  Dot com.  D-Tiller dot com.  But he talks about the methods of abortion available in his clinic.  Oh.  And he goes up to 22 weeks, which I don't think that's nine months.  That's about –  It's not even close.  What are we talking, the four and a half months?  Yeah.  Okay.  Five – yeah, five – yeah, almost five months.  That's pretty long.  So if you're going to have one of those big-footed babies or one of those no-face guys or tree  people, it's time to get that out of there.  I haven't seen the law yet, so I'm trying to find that law. 
[00:45:30]  But no, that sounded a little radical, up to nine months.  Yeah, nine months.  All right, let's go to – what's WI?  Wisconsin, I guess?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Tony, what's up?  How's it going, boys?  He's a cheesehead.  I know.  I didn't feel like Tony.  Hey.  What's up, Tony?  I was wondering if Anthony heard that his good friend Dominic Barbera's yacht caught  on fire up in Long Island Sound.  Did it?  Yeah, I have serious also.  I heard it on Howard 100 News. 
[00:46:00]  They had to save him, and he was in his underwear.  They had to save him, and he was in his underwear?  Save me.  You know that Anthony pretty much paid for that yacht, right?  Yeah, that was my boat, by the way.  It wasn't Dominic's boat.  That was my – I bought that boat.  The SS Gamer.  All right.  Punch it on, boys.  All right.  Well, that's good.  That's wonderful.  Let's take a break.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  What do we know about this plane crash in Madrid?  You.  153 dead, huh?  It looks like on the – like they do, the news does the graphics when they simulate  the plane coming in.  It looked like it was coming in for a landing.  Was it a takeoff?  No, it was taking off.  It was a second attempt at a takeoff.  Yeah.  And a couple of the survivors said they heard an explosion, some kind of a bang.  It's an MD-80, so it's got two engines on the back. 
[00:47:00]  So if it was an engine on takeoff, that's the worst time to lose an engine.  Sure.  And it came back down.  It had just gotten off the ground, and then it veered over and, like, full of fuel, you  know?  They were just taking off, so a lot of people just burnt.  Wait, people survived?  Yeah.  They had about 20 survivors.  A lot of them in bad shape, burns, and stuff like that.  But they had a few that walked away with some scratches.  What part of the plane were they sitting there? 
[00:47:30]  I guess the part that wasn't burning.  No, I understand that, but you know why I'm asking.  I'm really not sure.  Yeah, that's where you want to sit.  Yeah.  Because if you're surviving that, when 153 of your fellow passengers are dying, you've  got to know – I need to know where they were sitting.  That's got to change your perspective on things.  Wow.  You know, you walk away from something like that when so many people get killed, and you're  just kind of like, hey, all right, made it.  You just happen to be in the right seat.  You just brush yourself off and go, holy ass. 
[00:48:00]  Red cap, grab my smoldering luggage.  I have a flight to get.  You're just one of those brave guys.  Yeah, most of these guys go on a second plane immediately.  They're showing it right now.  Wow, it took off sideways off the runway.  And oh, God, does that look awful.  Oh, and wow, that's a fine simulation right there.  I think they were just using Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Were they really?  Yeah, you could kind of really do a lot of weird things with that.  It took off, and it looked like it started to bank left immediately.  And then, like, you know when you're flying, you're coming in for a landing, like it feels 
[00:48:30]  like you're going left and right, like you're sliding on ice.  Yeah, yeah.  It looked like it was doing that, and then boom, it just banked right really hard and  crashed.  It kind of made its own S.  Yeah.  It started left and then, whoa.  So.  All right.  Jeez.  Yeah, absolutely.  Apparently, this plane had been stopped from flying twice before because of technical difficulties  very recently.  And then I start thinking, why can't we have inspection stickers like we do in elevators?  You get in an elevator, and you see when it was last inspected.  Oh, you want to be able to see where the plane was last inspected? 
[00:49:00]  When was the last time somebody checked this thing?  Yeah.  How old was the plane?  Was it one of ours that we were done flying?  It was McDonnell Douglas, so an MD-80.  MD-80s aren't new.  I think American flies, though.  I have much more faith in them.  Yeah, American flies them.  Maintenance than I would in.  Yes, Spanish air.  Spanish air.  I don't know what it is.  It seems like a lot of these crashes happen somewhere else because I think we, like,  just give the rest of the world our old planes.  Yep.  And that is true.  And they figure, ah, we can get a few more years out of these planes before we get more planes 
[00:49:30]  from the United States.  15 years old.  That's it?  Yeah.  The plane was 15 years old.  You sure it wasn't 15 years since its last, like, upgrade?  That's not that old.  I didn't think they were still rolling those things out 15 years ago.  It sure isn't.  Moving on really fast.  What did I miss in the Olympics?  Because I went and hung out with Jimmy last night as he taped Red Eye.  There was a lot of rain last night, and they didn't get to the BMX medal round.  You missed a demonstration thing from the gymnast.  I heard the BMX is pretty damn cool. 
[00:50:00]  That thing is so cool.  And then this morning, in the overnight, we won the America, won the gold medal in the  women's volleyball.  Oh, with that almost hot piece of...  Miss D. May and Carrie Walsh.  Carrie Walsh.  Well, she's a butter face.  Yeah, she is.  Yeah, she's got an amazing body in her faces.  But not bad when she's wearing the big sunglasses that, you know, cover up the hurt.  That's what those girls have to do.  She has a hell of a hiney, though.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You just spit up eggs, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  Right there.  Gotta love the beach volleyball.  They understand how to keep the sport sexy, man.  Look at what they wear.  Yeah, they've kind of tried to sexy up the Olympics.  Well, we didn't get to the story yesterday.  We were talking about ping pong, and then we went off on one of our fine Opie and Anthony  tangents.  But they're trying to encourage the...  Wow, look at that shot of her butt.  Go back up.  That one.  Carrie Walsh.  Yeah.  Just click on that.  No, the other one.  I know this is radio, but I'm sorry for my own...  It's in the middle top right there. 
[00:51:00]  My own pleasure.  We're looking at a hiney shot soon if it opens.  At Google Images, sometimes it's a curse.  Yeah, I know.  Why does it open so small on the top?  Oh, just give me the big picture.  Look at that.  Wowie, wow.  What is that?  That's Carrie Walsh, my friend.  She now has a gold medal.  For her ass?  Well, yeah.  They give her a gold medal for her ass.  She's got legs for days.  I want to wear the bottom of that little bikini as a Breathe Right strip.  She's six foot two. 
[00:51:30]  And she's pretty much...  Next Olympics, they're going to be down to thongs.  Right?  Dare to dream.  Well, look how close they are now.  That's barely covering anything.  But then you turn around and the face is just so disappointing.  How bad could it be, though, with that ass?  You've seen her face.  Here's her face.  Let's see.  Oh, no.  Is this the little teeny lip?  Is this burn victim lips, lady?  Look at her face.  Which one is she?  On the left.  Yuck.  Wow.  What a difference. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, that's God's bad little joke.  Right.  The Lord was playing a joke.  Did she catch all the spikes with the center of her face?  He made her from the toes up, and by the time he got to the face, he was just tired.  Yeah.  Said, ah, good enough.  I'm not going to work on this one anymore.  Look, look, look, look, Jimmy.  I'm done.  Just pop that head on it.  How disappointing is that when you see that body?  I mean, not an awful face, but it doesn't go with the body.  If you start with the face and work your way down, it gets better. 
[00:52:30]  But if you start with the ass, then she turns around and goes, hi.  Oh, yuck.  Back in the pillow, you.  Exactly.  I hope you're hungry, because there's a feather snack coming your way.  Adam in Jersey, what's up?  What do you have?  Boys, good morning.  What's up?  We're just hanging out.  Yo, some brain just totally glazed over the fact that it was pouring out when these chicks  were wearing their white little uniforms.  Oh, really?  He glazed over the fact, hold on, hold on, that they were wearing white bikinis? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, did we lose that?  He said it was raining out, and they were wearing white bikinis.  We lost Adam, just in the middle of a good point.  He's pointing out to Stump Brain's homosexuality.  I didn't get to see it, because it happened overnight.  They delayed the match, because there was lightning and all kinds of massive rain last night.  The rain that washed out the BMX, they said, no, we're playing volleyball.  Really?  And they did play it through.  It finished about 4 o'clock this morning.  Oh, by the way, getting back to the sexy outfit, so ping pong yesterday, we were going to  talk about this, but we forgot. 
[00:53:30]  They're noticing that the attendance is way down at ping pong.  Because it's ping pong.  Yeah, but China loves their ping pong.  They were saying it's like one of the most popular things in China, right?  So they're trying to encourage the participants to wear something that shows off their curves  to get more people in the seat.  Sexy it up?  They're trying to sexy up ping pong, yeah.  Hold on, let's look at this picture of Sean Penn.  And it's so disappointing, isn't it?  She's awful.  It's so disappointing.  Wow.  That is amazing. 
[00:54:00]  Looking at that back shot, that side back shot, and then that front shot of her.  Yeah.  It is Sean Penn.  Wow.  Let's go to Tim in Boston, listening on BCN.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Uh, yeah, I used to work on those, uh, those MD-80s out of Logan in Boston, and, uh, I tell  you, they don't have a good track record, that's for sure.  No, they don't.  No, they, uh, they come apart all the time.  They come apart.  Those JT-8s that they're flying, that junk. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Oh, great.  All right, thanks, Tim.  We're distracted because now we got a, we got a, we got a picture of Sean Penn next to  a picture of Curry Walsh, and wow, it's pretty close.  That is really close.  Put that up because.  Yeah, that is close.  Separated at birth.  Who came up with the Sean Penn thing?  Yes, Jimmy.  But Danny found it.  That's brilliant.  Can I tell you, by the way, as we were talking before, they were showing the race, the guy  Bolt, the Jamaican dude.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  That son of a bitch is fast.  Wow.  They were showing him, again, full speed running against it.  He was 20 feet ahead of the other fast people.  That is one fast.  It is just amazing, the speed.  Whoa.  He's Jamaican, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Ironic that his last name is Bolt.  Yes.  No, it's, there's a couple things going on with him, too.  The sports columnists, they're kind of going, hinting, like, well, we hope he's clean, huh? 
[00:55:30]  Oh, really?  They can't imagine that anyone would be this fast without maybe a little something something  in their system, so they're kind of, no one's saying it, but they're kind of hinting, like,  is this guy being checked out?  Because this is not normal.  You know what?  Watching him, watching him run, the stride he has, I don't know how long that is.  How, how, well, they were saying, like, in the 100 meter, he takes three, possibly four  strides less than, than everyone else.  Unbelievable.  And these guys are all, obviously, world-class sprinters. 
[00:56:00]  And with the stride, the long stride, it, his legs are moving so fast, too.  Yeah.  He was so far ahead of everybody else.  No, it's great, too.  And, you know, he, after the, the 100 meter race, he was beyond cocky and just really,  like, kind of rubbing, rubbing in how great he is.  And some of the people are like, ah, bad sportsmanship, this is not good, and, you know,  the kids are watching.  And I'm sitting there at home, and it's like, this is what the Olympics need, some showboating.  Some showboating and some smack talk. 
[00:56:30]  Okay.  And he's a Jamaican.  You would think, you know, being an American, you would be angry that someone like that is  kind of shoving it in your face.  But I thought it was cool as hell that the guy's like, he has this pose like, ah, with  the hands.  Yeah.  Basically saying, look how great I am.  They said he's right.  He ran faster than anybody has ever run.  He should be cocky.  Yeah, the fastest guy in the world.  I don't think he's cocky enough.  No.  And they're spitting on people.  Who are you? 
[00:57:00]  I ran faster than anybody has ever run.  I wiped it off your face.  And basically they're saying, bad, bad, bad.  And so he, like, toned it down a little bit yesterday.  Tone it down.  Don't tone it down, man.  I love that stuff.  That's what's missing in football.  Yeah.  All the showboating they're taking away from the game.  I'll say this.  These guys do whatever the hell they want out there on the field.  You never hear black people complaining about showboating.  That's a white complaint.  I'm a big fan of the showboat.  Me too.  Big fan.  The touchdown dances and the sack dances, all that crap.  Half these guys look ridiculous when they're doing it, which makes it kind of fun to watch. 
[00:57:30]  Stupid Tom Landry, who I loved, but used to yell at the players.  I want to say Drew Hill.  I could be wrong.  Or Tony Hill.  For showboating at the end or for spiking the ball.  What do you think his stupid hat was?  He was showboating with his stupid hat.  That was his trademark.  He wanted to be known for it.  Yeah.  Landry in his dumb hat.  There's a quote talking about, what's his name? 
[00:58:00]  Usain Bolt, right?  That guy is fast is a quote from somebody.  You want to guess who said that guy is fast as they were watching?  Captain Obvious?  As they were watching Usain Bolt set the world record in the 200 meters last night.  That guy is fast.  Who would say that?  Bob Costas.  Heather Mills.  Again, two days in a row.  Well, why not?  Always appropriate.  Yes.  This is why I love Usain Bolt. 
[00:58:30]  He said, that guy is fast.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He's talking about himself like he's somebody else.  Indeterred person.  This guy is cocky and I can't get enough of that.  They showed the footage of him running.  He is so far ahead of the other guys.  Yeah.  Well, everyone is really, really mad because he was showboating in the 100 meter and he  was celebrating 20 meters before the finish and he had a shoe untied and people are like, 
[00:59:00]  do you understand what he would have done in the 100 meters if he took it seriously?  You know?  And he still set the world record.  Yeah.  Let him do what he wants to do.  He wants to run faster than anybody with the shoes untied and wave.  Let him.  It's just business.  I think that he knew he was going to set the world record in the 100 meter and he held  back a little bit so he could set the world record again.  You know what I mean?  Because then you get headlines again like today.  If he's going to stay in London or wherever the hell is the next track meet, then no  one's going to watch because it's not the Olympics, but at least he'll get some exposure 
[00:59:30]  because he sets a world record.  I think it's strategic on his part.  I really do.  Yeah, this stuff goes on all the time.  These people are competing and training and stuff and then once every four years they get  to shine.  Don't you think at this point that the world's ready to have the Olympics, maybe not every  year, but at least every two years?  Well, they kind of do.  Summer and winter.  No, but I mean like, yeah, but all right, but Michael Phelps now goes away for four  years.  Yeah, yeah.  You won't hear from him.  He'll endorse for the next six to eight months, maybe a year, and then he goes bye-bye until 
[01:00:00]  London.  You know, I think the world is ready to have the Olympics every, let's call it every two  years.  I would say every year.  I think he gets some pretty good ratings.  Let's say every six months.  I say every month.  All right.  I say every 10 years.  I say every week.  Every week.  And the Dakota Olympics.  All right.  We go to break with primetime gossip. 
[01:00:30]  We haven't done this in a long time.  I have no idea what he's talking about today, but it's our own Sam with some gossip.  Just when you thought it was safe to come outside, we're back with more primetime gossip.  New CBS executive producer for O&A, Stunt Brain, has been hitting home runs left and right  since bursting onto the scene only a few months ago as the stunt brain to be used when O&A  need an extra mind to think.  His whole gig is he's stunt brain.  When your brain's not working, it does. 
[01:01:00]  He jumps in like a stunt man jumps in for an actor.  Like, he's our brain if we need a stunt brain.  And the head is just filled with so much knowledge that he has to call himself stunt brain.  Unfortunately for Stunty, the O&A internet network collapsed recently, exposing old Stunt  Google for what he really is, a quick typing, no nothing.  No, come on.  I don't know.  How old is Christine Appleby?  Stunt brain.  Stunt brain.  You know what?  It's not stunt brain.  It's stunt computer.  Just with the fingers on a computer. 
[01:01:30]  You're like the Wizard of Oz.  Right.  We all think you're so smart and everything, but it's the machine.  Get no attention to that man Googling.  That's right.  Without the internet by his side, Stunt brain's only real skill of supplying information became  virtually non-existent.  How bad was Stunt brain without his laptop?  He was like...  He was almost as smart as E-Rock.  Wow.  He made E-Rock look like...  Put the smart guy in here.  The irony of the unfolding events were not lost on some of the O&A crew. 
[01:02:00]  We talked to one member who prefers to remain nameless.  I told you guys he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  What do you mean?  Do I have to spell it out for you?  He's thick.  Has Stunt brain's stock gone down?  We here at PTG can't confirm, but certainly hope so.  Stay tuned for all the O&A news delivered to you when you need it from Primetime Gossip.  Primetime Gossip. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, that's a really good one right there.  Yeah, I like that he calls it the PTG.  Yeah.  PTG with Sam.  Very good.  You've been exposed, my friend.  Poor Stunt Brain.  Oh, Stunt Brain.  Oh, Stunt Brain.  Oh, Mike.  Fraud.  Oh, Mike.  Just Mike from now on.  You're a fraud.  Mike-o.  What's your last name?  All right.  Hey, we got the intervention audio of the Huffer with the Walking on Sunshine, which is... 
[01:03:00]  Oh, that wasn't it before?  Well, you know, it's funny you should say that, Jimmy, because I was walking down the  hall in between breaks.  I go, Tim, how's the show sounding so far?  And he goes, hey, you know, the huffing thing you guys started with this morning, it  felt a little flat.  Yeah.  I'm like, thanks.  Thanks a lot, Tim.  I got to agree with him.  Yeah?  Yeah, it didn't play well for radio.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, we got the clips.  And it wasn't the right clip.  Eh.  I got to agree with him.  But it was our first break of the morning. 
[01:03:30]  You know, people shouldn't expect too much.  We're still waking up.  Oh, yeah.  Don't expect anything.  If we did in the 8 o'clock hour, oh boy.  Oh, boy.  Big trouble.  Yeah.  We're going to try it again after the break.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  What's up, peeps?  Yo.  Have we done the booyah today?  Who wants to do the booyah?  Jimmy, why don't you do a booyah for everybody today? 
[01:04:00]  Boo.  Oh, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ah, ha, ha.  By the way, so far?  Yep.  The listeners get a C-plus today.  Really?  Yeah.  They're always grading us.  Well, guess what?  We're grading you now.  C-plus.  That doesn't sound very good.  No.  Their participation in the show sucks so far. 
[01:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Passing grade, though.  Because we're easy.  We're the easy teachers.  Easy class.  Yeah.  They all line up to register for our class.  That's right.  Because we take you outside when it's warm.  Yeah.  And we'll have sex with you.  There was something that was pretty interesting to me during the little Mac commercial we were doing.  Mm-hmm.  You go to college.  You download the professor's lecture. 
[01:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  On your iPod.  Yeah.  From iTunes.  Yeah.  And you watch or listen to his lecture that way.  Yeah.  So you don't have to go to the class.  Yeah.  All right.  Is that school?  Is that really school now?  Or what is that?  Sure it is.  Well, when I went to college, we didn't have that.  I assumed not.  We didn't have computers.  We didn't have laptops.  You had to take notes. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd have to sit there.  The kids these days have it very easy.  He would, like, give it where she, look at me being sexist, the professor would profess,  and then you'd have to take notes down.  Now you just download it onto your iPod, and then you can kind of hang out with whoever  you want, listen to it.  But that's the world, Anthony.  Yep.  People are listening to the show right now.  Not when we did it live.  Yeah, I know.  But doesn't that sound like cheating? 
[01:06:00]  People do correspondence courses.  Don't they do, like, uh...  Yeah, but that's not real school.  But I'm saying it's like, it's been...  I think as we proceed, eventually you're going to have those same things with the new dragon  speaker and all that stuff.  Just all of a sudden, you don't have to take notes anymore.  It will just pick up the words and print it for you.  See, but I assumed that part of the whole college experience, of which I know nothing  of, was being in a classroom with people, taking notes, the ability to take notes, to listen 
[01:06:30]  to a professor, to have some kind of personal interaction.  I thought that was part of the experience that actually helps you in life.  I think it's a good tool, but maybe what the colleges should do is give maybe a half  grade for the people that are actually coming to the classroom.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you get a little extra.  So they don't stay in their dorm rooms and never come to class.  Maybe there's something they demand that you still have to come to class, but here's  a tool, just in case you weren't paying attention or you were sleepy that day, you can download 
[01:07:00]  it and watch the lecture again.  You kidding me?  Eventually you cut down on housing costs, they'll probably...  It'd be great for, like you said, the University of Michigan, if they can figure out a way to  get you...  Because you don't interact with your professors when there's 200 of you in a classroom.  You probably don't put your hand up very often.  Looks in the movies, they're always helping and interacting with the professors.  I know, and the psychiatrist will run out at two o'clock in the morning in a raincoat.  What's the matter?  Are you having a breakthrough?  It's not real.  But eventually they'll figure out a way to test you at home. 
[01:07:30]  You'll be at home taking the test and you'll probably have to have a camera on you so they  can see that you're not cheating.  Oh, those computers.  Don't you think it's...  They're taking over the world.  Don't you think it's stupid at this point that a lot of people still have to commute?  Because I think the bosses and these companies, they have to justify, I guess, what they're  paying their employees, so they force them to go to work when a lot of their job can  be done at home.  It's sitting in front of a computer and doing stuff, yeah, on a computer, they could do that  at home.  But companies and bosses, they just can't get wrapped around the fact that they don't 
[01:08:00]  really need a lot of their employees at work anymore.  Don't need cubicles.  Right.  With funny little Ziggy comics taped up on the wall.  Those are always funny.  He's peeking over the fence.  Oh, what's he doing now?  Peek-a-boo.  Peek-a-boo, Ziggy.  Big nose.  I'd love to chop his nose off with a hatchet.  I'd love to just de-nose Ziggy with a nice hatchet.  What are you doing now, fathead?  Hit the bricks.  We're going to do take two with this intervention thing. 
[01:08:30]  We're going to try this again, people.  Well, Stunt Brain brought to our attention that there's this girl, Allison, out there,  and she likes to huff the computer duster stuff.  Yeah.  And she does 10 cans a day.  10 cans a day, right in her mouth.  She's doing it every five minutes.  I guess she was molested as a child.  Oops.  And this is how it manifested itself later in life, I guess.  By the way, you cannot walk down the sidewalk with Jimmy. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, I know.  He goes into Uncle Paul mode and just comments on every child that is walking the streets  of the city.  But it's all hello.  It's nothing bad.  Oh, it's just hello.  No, no.  That's what I'm saying.  But it's hysterical.  The little names you come up with.  It's little Steven and Stephanie.  How you doing, Marjorie?  Better be on.  Put down your knapsack.  Look, she's a little tattletale, he says.  And then we were walking down the street, and whenever we would hit a crowd by a crosswalk, 
[01:09:30]  we would just go, get out of my way.  People look like, what are you saying to me?  He's singing, get out of my way to me.  That damn thing is catchy.  Get out of my way.  Whenever anybody's blocking your way, that's all I do now.  That whole thing started as a goof, but now it's so freaking catchy.  She's fantastic.  Can we get that stuck in people's heads today, please?  I can't stop singing it.  I want it, because it really is.  What?  There it is.  There it is. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  It certainly is swinging back the other way.  We should use all our powers to make that like a hit song, so Steve is forced to travel  the country and perform that thing.  Make it huge.  Yeah.  In his dumb Lane Bryant dresses or whatever the hell he was wearing back then. 
[01:10:30]  He'll be on American Idolt.  Hey, let's try this again.  I just feel like there's something here with this Allison girl, the huffer.  The video, it's up on onaradio.com.  Really, really funny.  Because, well, let's just play the first clip.  Here it is.  We meet Allison.  Allison is just a really bright girl.  She's studying to be pre-med, but now my sister is a drug addict.  All of the chemicals that are supposed to be like cleaning electronics, she just inhales 
[01:11:00]  the whole thing in her mouth.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  See, this is where those dopes in the office effed up the whole bit.  Yeah.  Because we needed this clip to establish.  That she said that.  You know what, Tim?  Danny's just nodding his head in agreement.  You know what, Tim?  You were right when you said that it fell flat this morning.  I apologize for getting mad that you actually critiqued the show in a bad way. 
[01:11:30]  No one knew why they were playing I'm Walking on Sunshine.  You couldn't hear it.  Right.  Sam?  I was cutting this up this morning, and Steve said that he was told from in here that we  needed the Walking on Sunshine music video clip now.  And I said, Steve, I'm cutting up the clips from the show now, and we'll bring them in together.  And he said, no, we need the music video now.  They want it now.  No, see, we needed the clip dry, because then it sets up the whole Walking on Sunshine music 
[01:12:00]  video that was made from that one dumb clip.  Steve misunderstood me, because I said we need clips, clips, clips.  You failed against that, Brian?  I may have, yeah.  Or there was just a communication breakdown.  But I wanted clips, because it makes no sense to play the video without the dry audio.  At this point, I've got to call you a fraud.  I'm honored.  Fraud.  More like stunt ankle.  So, Steve, what happened? 
[01:12:30]  Let's get to the bottom of this.  Stunt amoeba.  What Mike just said is, because I asked him, literally, I said, are you sure they want the  remix?  And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, okay.  So, that was what it was.  Oh, now we got Danny piping in.  All right.  You might disagree.  You seem pretty adamant that that's exactly what they wanted, was the remix.  Yeah, because I asked.  But wouldn't you think that it didn't make sense?  Like, wouldn't you say, oh, I wonder why they'd want that?  It doesn't make any sense to play.  Believe me.  Believe me.  I asked that to myself.  That's why I asked Mike for clarification. 
[01:13:00]  And I misunderstood.  What happened?  But now we got the, now we got this, now we got this, now we got this thing established.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I want to hear the last part of this again.  Cleaning electronics.  She just inhales the whole thing in her mouth.  It's like I'm walking on sunshine.  Now it's funny.  Now it makes sense.  Wow. 
[01:13:30]  It made no sense before because there was no context to the walking on sunshine.  She's huffing the computer duster and that's what it makes her feel like, walking on sunshine.  And then she has to huff immediately after saying that.  How long after that did they play the music?  Was it like right after they just, they.  The walking on sunshine?  Yeah.  Was that like, did she say that?  It wasn't even in the show.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  So you have to, how radio works.  You got to establish something and then it becomes something else.  Someone took this audio and made a walking on sunshine, the famous Katrina and the wave song and put it up on YouTube. 
[01:14:00]  And it's hilarious.  Oh, okay.  And now that video is linked on onaradio.com.  But we, as a dumb radio show, went right to the video and people are like, what?  What?  What are you doing?  Hmm.  All right.  That makes sense.  All right.  We have another clip of Allison.  She was using duster while driving.  And as she was huffing, she was turning a corner and passed out.  And she actually caused a four car collision. 
[01:14:30]  I need more of aerosol cans.  And I need them now.  We're going to leave this instant and get it.  I don't care if I sacrifice the life of anybody else.  I need it now.  You know, it's safe to say I'm going to be a father someday.  Yeah.  If I have one of these dopes, I'm going to just tell them, go away.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not going to be the enabler. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  That.  Leave.  How much attention do you need?  Call it tough love.  Hell yeah.  The mom's there, like, eating pizza with this thing as she's huffing on computer duster.  And to A&E, this is more freak show TV, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  They know this is going to get the people watching.  We're not going to play audio clips of the alcoholic.  We're going to play audio of this type of thing.  We love peering in on people that are doing much worse than we are. 
[01:15:30]  That's what it is.  And then you get the little brat demanding, I want my computer duster now.  No, we're leaving now to get more.  And there's mommy grabbing her purse and keys like, okay, honey, okay.  Ugh.  That is annoying.  It is, right?  Best way to stop that, get a can and cut a few farts in it.  There you go.  Dust away, dumbbell.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  More Allison.  She didn't really have a father figure. 
[01:16:00]  And not having that figure in her life, I think, has really affected who she is.  Wrong.  How many people out there don't have a father figure in their lives and they didn't go into  this computer duster huffing thing?  Mm-hmm.  Anthony didn't have a father figure for a lot of his life.  You're not computer dusting, are you?  I had some father figure in my life when I was in California.  For a while, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  I was always, like, some, you know, guy around. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Although I wouldn't have been huffing.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people that, you know, it sucks.  They don't have a father figure, but they're not going down this road.  Mm-hmm.  This excuse.  I had to do this because Daddy wasn't around.  Ugh.  Huff now.  Just go away.  Huff.  You've matured to just walking around half-nude with a gun strap to your own home.  Very nice.  Yeah.  He's accepted who she is. 
[01:17:00]  I wish I had a father.  Oh, shut up.  Do you?  But he left me.  And also his whole side of the family left to me.  Because you stink.  They won't speak to me.  Because I let my dad down.  Mm.  Did you?  Ah! 
[01:17:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  She just started screaming?  Yeah.  She's beatable.  Wow, is she awful.  She looks like she's got the worst case of asthma ever.  And just has to carry around giant inhalers.  Constantly.  She was inhaling and cutting at the same time.  Wow.  Was she telling?  It was really bizarre.  Cutting?  Yeah.  She had a razor blade and was slicing down her forearm.  Ew.  I get it.  I'll pay attention.  I'd paint my junk like computer cleaner. 
[01:18:00]  Here you go, sweetie.  Ah!  That's funny.  Do you guys want more, Allison, or what?  Of course.  All right.

[01:41:00]  i got out of the service uh i ended up sleeping with my friend's mom who was 52 and uh i did that uh  certain um task that anthony was yes alluding to sure yes um i i wouldn't say it was uh it was long island  at low tide wow the long island sound a few horseshoe crabs and some barnacles and seaweed 
[01:41:30]  some of those old muscles that i've been laying around the sun too long like chewing liver on the  west shore expressway i gotta ask why man why it was i had just gotten out of the service uh it was my  friend's mom had it was was was coming on to me and it was one of those hey uh it's been a while  why not was it hot because she wanted it so bad that's the only thing i could think yeah yeah it was  just one of those things where the the attention was there she you know someone nobody had paid 
[01:42:00]  attention to me in a while and she was just flirting like crazy and i'm like and why not what but  weren't you just getting out of the service weren't you just coming off of you know bang bang girls and  some you know exotic locale one girl in every port my my first year in the service i did in the  philippines and i was all over the prostitutes and then the next three years between desert storm  and california i didn't have a single thing i mean i was completely completely dead for like three years 
[01:42:30]  in california and then yes chaplain assistant so then he gets this 53 year old hey dude can i ask you uh  what like what what was the seduction process like and and when she took her clothes off you know  describe like the undergarments of what anthony's uh asking is when did you have your first gulp of of  of brother oh my god oh god  the the first uh the first uh whiff was uh when the when i actually you know if i remember right she 
[01:43:00]  took her shirt off and i and i smelled something and that is usually a bad sign  you smelled america you're used to that in the philippines this guy probably rather smell the  death around fallujah it's like smells familiar was she wearing sweatpants and just like really odd  socks yeah what was the underwear like uh it was it was uh old granny panties uh see she wasn't she 
[01:43:30]  wasn't in bad shape doesn't matter though you see the point i was trying to make was you're never  going to see those little boy shorts on uh these old broads and if you do it ain't going to look good  and those things are hot it definitely wasn't hot i mean it was it was uh okay thank god there's no  lights and lots of alcohol i'm actually dry heaving i swear to god it's i'm so close to puking  danny's leaving that picture up there i know well because we're looking at that picture as he 
[01:44:00]  describes this it's kind of like it's perfect and then if you get you go you go into the bathroom  maybe at at some girl's apartment or something like that she brings some stuff it's you know you  open up a cabinet or two there's like hot sexy things in there you know girls all their little  lotions and their cute little colorful things that they do and then what do you want to see like an  old woman's medicine cabinet oh look she's got a tuba crack cream for her heels yeah you need that 
[01:44:30]  and then some kind of medication because her womb is falling out she has snake oil actual real snake  oil yes this elixir will help you i don't believe in store-bought medicines now i'm interesting and  weird mongo hold on because well actually we're going to let you go there's too many people calling in  now uh you got this guy he really likes older women right dave in tennessee dave hey what's up 
[01:45:00]  gentlemen what's up i mean i really dig all the women i think it stems back to uh my first experience  uh i was 13 and she was 32 and for some reason that's pretty cool  was it a teacher thing or it was my best friend's mom carol melissa and um i spent the night over there  and she just hit on me and we you know went at it so i mean it was pretty cool how old are you now  i'm 35 how old are the women that you like uh well i mean i don't go too old like 50 is the oldest 
[01:45:30]  you know what it's not too bad it is it is oh what is that the 13 32 year old combo like david tell  said that's that is hot yeah how did how did she hit on you maybe she was just tucking you in or  something maybe you took it the wrong way all right gentlemen punch it out wow that's cool yeah  13 nice yeah not one guy will complain over that but if it's a yeah 32 year old guy with a 13 year 
[01:46:00]  old girl now all hell breaks then you're talking to chris hansen yeah then all right dateline nbc such  a double standard have some lemonade right chat in ohio chad what's up guys hey hey so i always  didn't hook up with an older girl finally got my chance she was 42 i was 21 and yeah i put my hand  down you know all right and it was completely unkept yeah ah see like and i wasn't expecting 
[01:46:30]  that because every girl i've ever been with you know she shaves and it was like the biggest turnoff  ever i never want to touch an older woman like you were pulling punk satani phil out of his little lair  that's an effing groundhog joke that works in august brilliant what he was 21 she was 40 that's  like a hollywood that's like a yeah and what's her name right yeah but he thanked so many young  girls he probably just got tired of it he wants something different maybe when you bang all hot 
[01:47:00]  young chicks then you get bored and she did tend to keep herself in shape if she's really hot  do you see gi jane hubba hubba 23 skidoo she had the short hair in gi jane the body looked good  though man what was that other movie with burt reynolds striptease oh where she was the stripper  yeah where she showed off her implants for the first time all right our intern was 19 she was 38 and  then you got danny you got a story our own danny was uh oh molested well he was having fun with a 
[01:47:30]  41 year old that had an 18 year old daughter danny was two she was 78 no when i was uh when i was  bartending i met somebody who was 41 and i was 20 and she had an 18 year old uh son so that was kind  of awkward i didn't know you were a road comic but uh i don't have any kind of weird gross stories like  these guys like it was fine and it was actually it was actually really good yeah but you but you 
[01:48:00]  obviously you know have some kind of issue with mom so i don't know i don't think this had anything  to do with it though yeah no it was just she was cool we had a good time and that was it hmm what  what comes to mind when we uh say uh danny's mom i can't say those words it's not on this side yeah  so the 18 year old daughter did you get a look at her no it was a sign it was a it was a yeah well  like i said he was a cute boy yeah even hotter did he like jump in in the morning and like wrestle you  or something no but i i did my best to try to avoid him at the house like you know if i saw his 
[01:48:30]  car out front like i would just oh that's embarrassing yeah how pissed that kid was oh  yeah i'm sure he hated my guts and i'm sure that he knew like what was going on because there were  some nights that i stayed over but i tried like to avoid i would like run out when he was in the  bathroom he'd call you the mf word and you just go yep you betcha yes siree did uh did what was uh  your love making very vocal uh in the house did he get what he might have heard uh 
[01:49:00]  kind of pleasure maybe i don't think so but it would be funny if it's nothing worse than hearing  mom going like i said like i really tried to avoid being at her like at the hat that house like i  didn't want what was his name i don't remember to be honest oh because that would have been hilarious  this is for you oh god son's name yeah wait can i say the taboo series taboo one and taboo two  in porn my favorite yeah especially taboo two well we all know what taboo is about yes naughty son 
[01:49:30]  and a mother who needed it right stepmother okay no no stepmother no no no real stepmother real  mother no they didn't play games currently stevens directed they didn't play games uh k parker  played the mom you talk about the director of the taboo things like it's scorsese no no no no this  guy he don't play games k parker in the first one seduces her son and then in part two um it's honey  wilder and her son and there's some great and what happens is these two older women are servicing the 
[01:50:00]  younger gentleman let's just say yes and uh they're just kind of looking at each other and and the one  goes oh tell me he tastes like paul who's her son oh god wow that is taboo and she goes oh please  please don't tell him because the the guy that they were with was friends with the son and and he  was oh please don't tell him she goes okay and then she was so campy she puts her mouth by the  the guy's ear goes i won't tell him you effed paul and he goes you have to paul it was so great 
[01:50:30]  we gotta find that clip now yeah it's really sexy hey here's a guy that married a cougar  david in indiana david hello gentlemen hi i got uh i was 23 and i met my wife um she was 35  and i'd always been into older women and um honestly younger younger girls younger women  whatever yeah they just have stupid asses like snare drums is that a problem my and i understand  though my wife is a in perfect shape i mean she takes care of herself she works out six days a 
[01:51:00]  week three hours and now you gotta you gotta so you gotta add on perfect shape for uh whatever  year old and the problem is that you have to say she takes care of herself yeah but young girls never  have to say that they're just there's only so much you can do on earth there's something called gravity  that will take its toll right but i'm i'm i'm 29 now and she's 42 43 so you know it's it's it's 
[01:51:30]  she's in the exact same shape she was six years ago but you're right you know she's got to take  care of herself uh a younger girl fall apart too though well i'll give you that some of them can but  doesn't it keep you on your game because like you can't use all those like you know  you know those uh young girl tricks you know like you know like i'm just different or you know like  say all those weird things that you say i'm just you know like it's not you it's  but she's also afraid she's also afraid that i'm gonna leave her for a younger girl good 
[01:52:00]  she's also on her game too well it looks like someone needs to see dr three-way  with the difference as we used to say all right thanks all right boys thank you  let's squeeze one more in and then we gotta take a break we got david telling studio uh  justin new york what's up hey what's going on guys good morning good morning  yo my first uh she was 32 when i was 14 she was my school  was she the bus driver

[01:59:00]  then the shooting yeah yeah it's like biathlon sport skiing and shooting at the same time i think  the german army as they were moving into russia wow good point that's right it's yeah a little cold  hey fritz put the skis on and yeah get on the train 100 there's another one of those  didn't translate over the years work will set you free did uh is it over yet the olympics or is

[02:00:00]  why not uh jimmy i'm also a fan of taboo series but you uh you're a little mixed up oh he's gonna  challenge you on your taboo facts yeah um you are speaking of um k parker who's in one and two yes  and three oh okay i thought she took a break no but you're actually oh you're talking about on peg  she's the one who whispered it in jimmy's ear i said that it was paul's ear no no aunt peg was 
[02:00:30]  massaging k parker um in part two no i know it was aunt peg of course she threw the orgy at the end ron  jeremy's in that scene wilder no honey wilder is the uh is the mother in part two who has sex with her  son uh but in the scene i'm describing it's aunt peg who's a friend of uh gina's don't you try to  challenge jimmy norton on taboo sir please i have two rooms painted because of that movie  thank you dave great what's that those movies are great oh they're wonderful the one and two are 
[02:01:00]  fantastic and i found out someone said mc foley loves those you rock knew that no he was talking  about on the show once wish i would have known that if you were out there you know what i like  to me is in part one when aunt peg is on the phone with k parker and she's being uh her boss is uh  you know in the good old days they were molesting her while she's uh working as secretary good old  and aunt peg on peg goes are you being raped oh that is so hot yeah and then she wakes up that  asian kid that uh asian kid yeah oh the asian girl and the boy yep she had a couple turned on two 
[02:01:30]  teenagers or whatever or they were adults but i mean like two you know yeah supposed to be that  sounds more like the emmanuel series if you ask oh yeah emmanuel yeah that was your favorite  emmanuel there was sylvia cristel how do you know and there was uh laura gemzer who was in black  emmanuel sexy i don't know but it was all about like uh exotic locales uh cheekbones and that girl  constantly looking sad you know buddy ebsen jane frizzy what was her she was like a roving photographer 
[02:02:00]  journalist or something i never got to that i i like i don't i don't i would just wait for the  lesbian seduction scenes they always had one good one yeah i don't remember well she was always in  something like on some you know vespa somewhere on the back and she always met a guy who was like  uh like the heart to heart guy you know it was like a millionaire playboy heart he was always  trying to get her to like you know stay here with me in hong kong and we'll have you know more  soft core music to zampere flute music filmed through cheesecloth 
[02:02:30]  yeah that damn k parker was fantastic though man yeah oh she it's really big 34 d's or what oh  is she great that soft cork stuff was so frustrating so that would be just awful that would be your cougar  like moment without a doubt that would be your not now but i mean back then i mean k parker i mean  except for like look in the 70s you know the styles were a little different unfortunately but but  whatever she's still really sexy man k parker was juicy yeah that must have been a wild time huh 
[02:03:00]  oh yeah all right evan thank you bye ev take care there goes evan how many taboos did they make  many many but the first the first two were great part three was okay um like in the rockies they  never yeah exactly yeah they never get it done with they want it back they never get it done with the  the trilogies ever part four third one always wasn't that one the revenge right and then there's  taboo american style which is a different series starring paul thomas and raven yeah that was a 
[02:03:30]  good one too and gloria leonard do you think they could do the same thing but put a z at the end and  make it more urban and hip all right taboos where it's actually just it's actually just the birth  parents having sex damn and what's her name again and peg and peg aunt peg hey uh oh i hate to change  the subject but there's a lot of discussion in the office about um this britney spears audio we got 
[02:04:00]  they're arguing if it's real if it's not it sounds like an isolated track it's slowly making its way to  the internet um basically how does that happen slowly well slowly oozing through the inter tubes  this is from an hbo concert back in 2001 audio surface late last year and now it's on the music  sites uh today literally today it's starting to kind of spread and they're all they're arguing the  office is it real is it fake i think it's real basically it's an isolated mic like ann said 
[02:04:30]  yeah rock thing and a lot of people it's come it's a laughter that comes out of different walls  and bring your rock in here and you go what did your hug think i was curious to do what him or  steve's of course guys in the office he was arguing about it but you know there were rumors that she  kind of just sang along to tracks to begin with so they would lower her mic so you wouldn't hear her  actually singing right much and then they would have a nice polished track that she was like kind of  singing over she could be singing and the track isn't going out out to the audience but a sound  a guy can completely right uh grab what she's singing and hear her uh her actual voice and 
[02:05:00]  that's uh basically what they're saying today iraq yeah this steve's been going on about this since  6 a.m if it was posted last year and this was legitimate all the entertainment sites and everything  would have been running crazy with this already we're steve so you're saying this is fake i think  it's fake but someone synced up the actual video with the audio and it kind of it matches up but then  against someone if they were going to do this it's not hard to imitate uh her voice there's a 
[02:05:30]  there's a wrestler on wwe who's a mock britney spears that sounds almost something like that  you're bringing into this the point because it does so the the point being that it's kind of easy  to imitate her voice there's other people who do her voice so i think it's fake wow iraq you're going to  lose on this one i don't know steve steve what do you got on this steve i've been  steve turned around and the cord fell out of the mic oh see even even the microphone does the 
[02:06:00]  microphone doesn't watch you on the air oh i've been toiling over this it's about 6 30 and if you  watch the video and you listen to it it's synced up exactly and it's entirely possible that when  she's dancing she can't sing so she needs backup singers so it's entirely possible that this is an  isolated mic track which you know we we've all heard before julio uh julio iglesias has had him  uh madonna's had him janet jackson's had him so you know a lot of people uh the famous one  lennon mccartney simpson give lennon mccartney one right yes so it's entirely possible all right so 
[02:06:30]  go oh no how about this some people are saying this is an isolated track and if you if you take away  everything and just listen to britney spears this is how it sounded back in 2001 on hbo allegedly  sounds great 
[02:07:00]  what was that other voice tighter is that her voice  she's she was uh hot or quicker if that's her wow yeah  i'm saying totally her yeah i'm i'm saying her too  i like when they whisper i feel like they're talking just to me 
[02:07:30]  wow they're all johnny bravos man that's all just all right studio produce it's vantage point who 
[02:08:00]  knows  that was nice and wet jimmy oh wow i hope you didn't hurt yourself that was that was an et  one we had a little like goodbye  bye-bye you stop breathing to get that one out oh yeah i didn't want to wait till day was done  talking i want to oh i'm sorry nice no i want to step on what you said step on him  what's that fast you just had to funny it up no no i just i felt good 
[02:08:30]  all the people look at you like i'm a little girl what did you ever think it'd be okay for me to  that's her yeah because a lot of people were amazed i remember saying how does she sing so well and 
[02:09:00]  dance at the same time you can't you just can't you just can't because she's a star  oh wow i can't even see the video but it sounds like she's in a pit and it's like that uh mad max 
[02:09:30]  thunderdome like this like yelling at her uh finally the last track uh a little set up britney  is lowered under the stage so she's singing dramatic moment lowered under the stage and  then they're doing something else right for a little while maybe so she does a costume change  and the mic uh is left on oh goody so you hear her ending her song and then she talks  to the people under the stage i guess the audience can't hear her no the audience cannot  hear her god i want to welcome you to a world this obviously is the end of her 
[02:10:00]  set up for whatever they're going to do on stage where anything i mean anything can happen  anti-gravity  she's being low it was an emotional moment  i was retarded  did y'all see the the sailors and all those people the air force base waving 
[02:10:30]  it was so adorable y'all it was so beautiful  yeah that's her she's really southern yeah y'all be seeing them y'all fly boys and whatnot  i saw guys i think they they fly on the whirlybirds yeah  what a dunce so adorable i think he rocks wrong in this one i think  i've been proven wrong too i'm uh definitely saying that's her yeah i thought she was gonna 
[02:11:00]  have like a little hissy fit under this yeah and uh apparently she does y'all see  emotion moment oh there's our music what i'm flying again well let's just uh before we head over to  sirius xm uh david tell promoting the gong show tonight at 10 o'clock  um on comedy central i've gone past promoting it i'm actually boring myself  please watch it i know yeah man watch it because the better the ratings do the more likely davis to  get more of these um so definitely so much later so support don't give away the secrets of television

[02:18:30]  it is i found the entrance wound i never liked the harry kennedy's head yeah it was like lincoln's  throat wound i was with a woman about a year ago had one unbelievable had a 70s yeah a real big  i killed it as soon as she took her pants off i stabbed her in the neck if you can find it  dead that's good stuff no i used to like that used to be a turn-on do you ever throw your car keys at  her uh hooch and go bring me because it looks like a puerto rican valet 
[02:19:00]  hey jose uh bring my car around i'll be done in about 15 minutes what i'm sorry that's your hooch  shit that's fucking awesome nice a tel says shit out of this like that's not even part of his  that i would make an hour out of like the shit that he does like just off the side i would write  a whole i would steal it all make one hour and he'll probably forget he even said it well i'll never  get used to the free like you know like being able to say whatever you can ever anything you want on 
[02:19:30]  on radio because like i've been uh like uh i guess battered like an austrian um you know dungeon  person from like regular radio every time it's in your mouth like no i mean um special play  candy shop uh something britney stinks  it's gonna be really hard for you guys when you launch gears when you're like it's  bizarre it's easier than it would be if it was the other way around you know if we did this show  first and then how to go there get it off your chest yeah yeah you're fucking oh yeah oh 
[02:20:00]  fuck uh taboo too taboo this is the line that jimmy wanted i believe so yeah i hope so  did you remind your paul hey  yeah it was the uh 
[02:20:30]  so basically i knew that scene i could name that tune the massage and uh  aunt peg whispers it while they're massaging and paul's her son right or her nephew one son from  part one right right right you fuck paul yeah your son see i remember in 1982 uh seeing that after  uh vicious uh sat prep  what a great uh releaser you have a stress it changed my life that movie did you ever have to go to the um 
[02:21:00]  the theater there in bayshore or somewhere on uh long island they used the bayshore porno  theater this wasn't that cool i was free free videotapes we went in high school i'm talking  like yeah this was like you'd go with your high school buddies absolutely and it was more just an  outing to go and have fun and laugh at fucking shit and but you'd sit down in a movie theater and watch  fucking hardcore porno right and there'd be some guys in there jerking off in a corner guys blowing  each other it was great you'd be sucking a guy's dick no no but it would happen i used to 
[02:21:30]  just i'm the only hope of gigs i would stop in this one place on route 130 and i stopped going  there it was just too creepy because there was always some something happening that shouldn't  be happening in the theater yeah yeah and i would always try to sit in the last row as close to the  wall as possible so you kind of had a good view of the action no so you could just see if there's  anybody next to you nobody would come next to you or behind you i don't want anybody sitting  behind well of course not um and you'd have to watch the cops because that's how they got uh  mr herman there peewee herman yeah i didn't care i jerk a little bit but it was just it was too 
[02:22:00]  public for me to jerk yeah i didn't care i wasn't worried about getting arrested that's why when  videotapes came out it was like you mean i could be home and watch this yeah and fuck it i am going  to scab up my cock this and i did when i would walk into a place like that you've never seen i was  fucking i was beautiful yeah because they're all old guys and they would just see me supple

[02:23:00]  and you're like a young guy you're like hey this is a what whoa what is that that's life coming at  you that's real life yeah i'm depressed now it's like smell of uh pneumonia ammonia smell of yeah that's  it is a fucking because everyone's loads on the floor they're clean with that smell when i smell  ammonia i immediately think the fucking booth and numb legs how many times have you jerked off standing
