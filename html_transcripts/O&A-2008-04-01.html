<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The April Fool's Day Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a rollercoaster of shocking and offensive humor, personal attacks, and celebrity interviews.  The show opened with a defiant assertion of their right to be provocative, immediately launching into a scathing discussion of an article in *Stepping Out* magazine written by Chauncey Hayden about their former producer, Rick Delgado.  Delgado’s article accused Opie and Anthony of fostering a hostile work environment, claiming Opie was disliked by colleagues, and downplaying Delgado's contributions to the show's success.  Opie and Anthony vehemently refuted these claims, countering with accusations of Delgado's ambition, poor work ethic, and alleged inappropriate behavior with female guests, including incidents involving photographs taken in the studio. They detailed past conflicts, even mentioning physical altercations that Delgado supposedly broke up.  The hosts also revisited past controversies, including the "Sex for Sam" St. Patrick's Cathedral prank and the "Tsunami" song, using highly offensive language throughout. They discussed their relationships with current and former sidekicks, like Jim Norton, speculating on the reasons behind Delgado's resentment. A call-in segment solicited listeners’ accounts of local radio stations' April Fool's pranks, focusing on Scott and Todd’s show in New York City and noting a reconciliation with Patty Steele.  The segment also mentioned an incident at WrestleMania involving E-Rock and Sam, who were both present in the studio.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Rick's departure, attributed by the hosts to his desire for stardom. This was followed by humorous banter, including a homophobic remark about Rick.  The conversation shifted to the listener-voted "March Bracket Brawl" (Rock Madness), with Metallica declared the winner, prompting a discussion of a related New York newspaper article. This led to a lengthy debate about Dane Cook, sparked by a critical Page Six article from Boston radio personalities Toucher and Rich. Opie defended Cook's popularity, contrasting him with other comedians mentioned in the article, and shared anecdotes about attempting to sabotage one of Cook’s shows.  A news story about hackers posting flashing images on an epilepsy foundation website followed, triggering a discussion about a similar incident involving Al Roker, with the hosts playing and analyzing Roker's apology.  E-Rock and Sam then gave an eyewitness report from WrestleMania, detailing a fireworks malfunction injuring dozens and recounting E-Rock’s antics, including consuming numerous "steak and mashed potato martinis" and attempting to get autographs using a Make-A-Wish child. The segment concluded with further WrestleMania discussion, upcoming tour dates, a humorous exchange with producer Steve Delgado, and a "Mastic Moment" featuring a local news story.  Comedian Mark Maron then joined the show as a guest.

Maron’s guest appearance focused heavily on his divorce and its financial ramifications. He described his ex-wife leveraging his future earnings to secure a significant portion of his assets, exceeding $100 million, despite his modest income at the time.  He expressed anger and frustration at the unfairness of the legal process.  Anthony shared his own negative divorce experience, detailing how his ex-wife emptied their joint bank account. The conversation explored the emotional toll of divorce, the perceived failings of the legal system, and the emotional impact, including feelings of loneliness and rage.  The discussion then pivoted to a previous prank in Boston, where they falsely reported the mayor's death, discussing the fallout and their ongoing feud with Boston radio station WEEI and hosts Dennis and Callahan.  Listeners were encouraged to call WEEI to express their displeasure. The segment concluded with continued discussion of Maron's divorce.

Later, the show featured both Mark Maron and Jose Canseco. Maron continued to discuss his recent relationship, describing his ex’s history of negative relationships and financial exploitation, followed by Canseco detailing his experiences with divorce and his use of prenuptial agreements. The conversation then shifted to Canseco's baseball career and steroid use, with Canseco claiming approximately 80% of players used steroids in the mid-90s. He named several players, including Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, claiming he even injected some of them.  He discussed the widespread nature of steroid use and the subsequent backlash, claiming he was blackballed for revealing it and expressing resentment towards several players, particularly Alex Rodriguez. The discussion included tangents about a ball hitting Canseco in the head, the women he encountered during his career (including one who enjoyed being choked during sex), and the physical effects of steroid use. Several listener calls followed, focusing on Canseco's past relationships, steroid use, and accusations against other players.  Canseco reiterated his belief that he told the truth about steroid use and didn't regret it.


The show continued with Jose Canseco promoting his book "Vindicated," alongside comedian Jay Moore who called in.  The conversation revolved around Canseco's book and the prevalence of steroids in baseball, featuring unsubstantiated claims about various figures.  The hosts joked about a bombshell revelation, creating fictional, absurd claims. Jay Moore’s call included discussions about his experiences (including meeting Canseco at a gym) and further speculation about baseball players and steroid use.  The hosts' feud with WEEI and their April Fool's Day prank were also mentioned. Janine, a former overweight listener who underwent gastric bypass surgery, joined the show, discussing her weight loss, surgery, and sex life after the weight loss.  The conversation became sexually charged. Lily, another contributor, joined for lighthearted banter about her New Orleans trip, racial comments, and career aspirations.  The segment concluded with discussions about the hosts' relationship with their staff, focusing on who liked or disliked Opie, interspersed with vulgar and sexually charged jokes and comments, challenges of the radio industry, and promotional plugs.

A final segment focused on perceived betrayals and grievances, primarily involving Rick. Opie detailed instances where he felt Rick acted insincerely, mentioning others who allegedly disliked Opie, including Dice and Ed Asner. Anthony attempted to lighten the mood during serious discussions.  A significant portion focused on the feud with WEEI.  Caller Jason reported a verbal altercation with the station, leading Opie and Anthony to strategize a counter-attack, providing WEEI's contact information for listeners to harass them.  Other callers shared opinions on disagreements with Rick and Dice.  Humorous moments stemmed from Anthony's attempts to lighten the mood, a fictitious character ("Mert Snort"), and a *Bronx Tale* reference. Adam Ferrara’s call provided a brief, lighthearted interlude. The show concluded with antagonistic banter targeting WEEI, interspersed with jokes and insults. Profane language was heavily used throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to pet a deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want to pet a deer.  Breast knuckles.  Clock them in breast knuckles.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out. 
[00:01:00]  What does it smell like when one of them burped?  An old tackle box.  Is he where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking Spanish.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We are live. 
[00:01:30]  There was a lot of speculation.  Will Opie and Anthony be live on April Fool's?  Oh.  Of course we're live.  A little known fact about the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the first live April Fool's show we have done.  No way.  Since 1998.  Are you kidding?  Since the famous mayor's prank that we did up there in Boston, Massachusetts.  This will be the first April Fool's show we have done since then.  All right.  Live. 
[00:02:00]  You get fired.  Oh, there was emails going back and forth all afternoon yesterday.  A bit of a panic out there.  A bunch of panic.  What do you guys got planned for April Fool's?  What are you going to do?  Let us know.  We need to review it.  We need to review it.  It's kind of funny, but a bunch of the April Fool's, since we did the big prank up there  in Boston, fell on a weekend, and a bunch of them did not fall on a weekend, and we 
[00:02:30]  were told to take the day off over the years.  Yeah.  Over the years, they wouldn't let us broadcast.  So, good morning, and April Fool's to everybody.  Like, yeah, we're not going to try to pull any shenanigans, as they say.  Or are we?  Or are we?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Phone number 877-212-018.  Also want to say good morning to Mert Snort.  Ugh.  Some Mert Snort.  I've been saying Mert Snort all night long. 
[00:03:00]  Mert Snort stinks.  I'm Mert Snort.  Linger longer, please.  And we got the boys back from WrestleMania.  Hmm.  Yeah, thank God.  I don't know how we made it through a day.  A day, two days.  Two days.  Oh, was it two?  Who knows?  You didn't even notice.  That's wonderful, Anthony.  E-Rod.  That's wonderful.  The hell knows where they are, what they do.  We did a show.  It came off great. 
[00:03:30]  True.  I think we could just toss those two guys.  True.  And then they could write horrible articles about us.  Right.  Us.  Hey, I got no problem with the guy.  Oh, that's true.  Seemed to be fine with me.  I hear I do.  I hear you might have a little problem.  I haven't read it.  Yeah.  Oh, wait till you read it.  Did he really badmouth me that jerk-off?  He certainly did.  It's Rick Delgado, the old producer.  It's a, you know, badmouth me, you prick.  When I saw you in California, we had a nice lunch together.  Hey, how are you?  We went out and ate.  You, you jerk-off. 
[00:04:00]  I didn't even read it.  Well.  Why?  Why?  Why, Rick?  I never had a bad word to say about you.  Why?  Yeah, our old producer just-  Well, because you suck on the show.  I was going to say-  Yeah, you're a funny guy, but you suck on the radio show.  You screw the show up.  Yeah.  Opie is a douche who needs to pretty much be sexually assaulted in the worst way possible  for a man. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, just picture some kind of shower scene.  Yeah, yeah.  Prison shower scene.  And me?  I'm a comedic genius.  So, you know, I don't think I really have a problem.  Well, because you hate confrontation, you ass.  No.  You have admitted on this show that you hate confrontation.  I'm beloved.  You avoid all confrontation, hence everyone thinks you smell like roses.  I am beloved. 
[00:05:00]  Because your daddy and mommy fought.  Right.  When you were a child, you hate confrontation.  Yes.  But guess what?  It helps you with your career, because no one has a bad word to say about you.  I should be a politician.  This douchebag.  Are you allowed to say that?  I don't know.  You should be.  Yeah.  Not allowed to say that one?  I don't think the part.  This douche.  This douche.  And that douche Chauncey Hayden.  Just obsessed with the Opie and Anthony show.  Totally.  Just continues to write bad articles about the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:30]  I think it's buddy Howie threw him out.  I don't even know if Howie likes him anymore.  I think that's why.  I think it's buddy Howie threw him out or something.  Yeah, well, it's an upcoming issue of Stepping Out Magazine.  They put Rick on the cover.  And Rick is a bit pissed off.  For what reason, I don't even know.  Who knows?  To be quite honest with you.  But what does he say here?  I didn't even know we were going to do this.  But, uh, uh, uh, how do you want to, well, I have to read the whole article now. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, you got to kind of read, um, well, at least the parts about us.  Uh, God.  All right.  On St. Pat's sex scandal.  We're all over the ball field here.  I apologize.  We'll get this back on track.  This is his take.  He was asked certain questions about certain events during his tenure as producer of our program.  Right.  And, uh, he answered these questions that Chauncey threw out at him, uh, knowing he was just baiting him. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Chauncey Hayden is an ass.  Uh, he, he's, he's pretty much a failed, um, writer.  He, he's gone nowhere over the years.  He's been with this crappy little rag magazine that.  That you pick up for free at bars and restaurants.  You pick up for free.  It's all he's done his whole career.  Um, he doesn't, he doesn't even try to get both sides of his story. 
[00:07:00]  Did he try contacting us about this?  Of course not.  No, because we would have said, here's the deal with Rick.  No.  And here's why he's so bitter with everything.  No, I would have said, go F yourself, Chauncey.  Well, of course.  We'll talk about it on our radio show, which reaches a hell of a lot more people than your dumb magazine.  But I probably would have talked to him because, uh, we're probably friends because I'm beloved.  You don't like confrontation.  I never said I don't like confrontation, Opie. 
[00:07:30]  Don't get me started.  We're going to have to fist fight again.  Where's Rick to break it up?  Break up the fisticuffs that were always happening.  Well, there's a lot of people that wonder why Rick wasn't, uh, wasn't brought along when we made our big comeback in radio.  Yeah.  And it's, it's as simple as this.  He wanted to be a star in his own right.  He did not want to be a producer.  Yeah.  And we did not want to deal with that anymore.  So we had to move on.  You want a producer that wants to stay pretty much for the most part behind the scenes and work on a radio show. 
[00:08:00]  He did not want that.  His goal was to get his own radio show.  So when we had the opportunity to build a whole brand new staff, when we came back to radio, we moved on from him.  Plus he had a pretty good gig.  He was working for, uh, Preston and Steve down there in Philly, which is a well-known radio show.  Yeah.  So it's like, look, you're doing okay.  We're moving on.  We don't need you.  Simple as that.  That's, that's how it went down.  But, uh, the stuff he says about, uh, uh, about me is just completely ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  I don't even know what to tell you on St.  Pat's, uh, sex scandal, according to this article, you offended people all over the world with, with your St.  Patrick cathedral sex capade.  Yeah.  First of all, it was a bit, and I came up with jointly based on a magazine article that we read in our office one day.  Right.  And, and, and Rick had nothing to do with it.  What the hell?  He was just the producer of the show that came up with the idea. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Uh, doesn't that go beyond just doing your job when so many, uh, are outraged by something you created?  That's BS.  Are people really offended by it?  He, he, uh, this is how Rick answers it.  How can a few people decide for everyone else?  What is offensive?  I find that effing offensive.  I don't want people representing how I should feel just like Reverend Al Sharpton.  Here's an unelected, uh, guy who gets offended by everything.  So I can't say the N word because of my skin color.  Seems like someone listens to our radio show.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, to me, that's offensive and racist. 
[00:09:30]  Think about it.  Here's a black guy who says you can't use certain words to describe black people.  If you're not black, you'll never win that argument.  I know that, but somebody has to say it.  Nobody ever says to Reverend Al Sharpton, hey, effer, you can't say S about white people.  How about that?  Wow.  Can I interject?  There's nothing worse than a dummy trying to sound socially poignant.  Shut your face.  Stop trying to sound bright.  You're not tearing the walls down on racial stereotypes.  You're not kicking the, kicking the doors in.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  It's trite nonsense.  Wow, Al Sharpton can say the N word and you can't.  How deep of you, Rick.  Uh, but what do you want to do a contest for that?  If you throw muffins at somebody while they said it, shut your mouth.  Uh, but nobody will say that to him.  He gets a free pass.  Brian Florence, who along with his wife was busted inside St. Pat's Cathedral for having  sex, died unexpectedly, unexpectedly of a heart attack.  How did it happen?  I was just having sex with him.  Some say the stress of the publicity is what killed him. 
[00:10:30]  How does that make you feel, Rick?  Well, he was due to go to court right before he died.  It was almost like God saying, you know what?  I'll take care of this one.  That kid's still got it.  Yeah, he certainly does.  What?  What the who the?  I don't think God would take out, you know, a person for having sex in a church, you dummy.  Well, he apparently did.  I don't mind that.  I just prefer a better joke there.  He said, I'll take care of this one.  I kind of smiled into the phone when he said it.  I'll take care of this one. 
[00:11:00]  Without getting into it, the guy had a lot of personal issues going on that had nothing  to do with the whole Sex for Sam thing that went on back in the day.  Might have been his drug using history.  Well, you know what?  I'll take care of this one.  And he took care of it.  However, all the radio people I talk about, the St. Patrick's incident and the tsunami  song have patted me on the back.  Why are they patted?  See, this is why we did not want him when we came back to radio.  Exactly.  It's all about Rick. 
[00:11:30]  Everyone was patting me on the back.  Why were they patting you on the back?  You were a dumb producer behind the scenes, you idiot.  While his head bobbed up and down in their laps.  Atta boy.  Atta boy.  A little deeper.  Atta boy.  They all say, dude, you got aft.  They all work in the industry and they admire.  I did something they couldn't do themselves for fear of losing their jobs.  On Opie and Anthony.  This is where it gets really, really interesting.  Your former radio pals, Opie and Anthony, are making millions today on both XM and terrestrial radio. 
[00:12:00]  Why are they working and you're not?  First of all, the St. Pat's incident is coming up on six years this summer.  In that time.  Is it six?  Yeah.  Wow.  Two thousand and what?  Two, right?  Two thousand, August of 2000.  So it's about five and a half years ago.  Within the last five and a half years, our old producer, Rick, had a job for the most part.  Yeah.  For most of that time.  So it says, your former radio pals, Opie and Anthony, are making millions today on both XM and terrestrial radio. 
[00:12:30]  Why are they working and you're not?  That's the Essie part.  Everybody gets paid except for me.  Rick forgets that when we all got fired for the St. Pat's incident, he got paid for four or five months.  And shortly after that, if not during that time, he got his next radio gig, which was with Preston and Steve.  Right.  He's friends with Preston or Steve, one of them.  Steve, I think.  Yeah.  And then after that, he went right from Philly to work here in New York City at Hot 97. 
[00:13:00]  Where in there was he not getting paid?  And then he got fired for the Tsunami song.  He took a few months off.  And then he got another gig in San Francisco.  Rick, where were you not getting paid?  He wants to get paid now because he blew up his radio career?  Yeah.  Wasn't getting paid from us, I guess.  The guys whose names are on the shingle are protected because they're bringing in the ad dollars.  But to be honest, O&A aren't bringing in any ad dollars these days. 
[00:13:30]  Really?  Really, Rick?  When do you get to look at the books for XM and for CBS?  When do you get to look at that?  Did they take you up there and give you a personal look at what this show bills?  You're privy to that information, are you?  Are you?  That right there, any writer that's worth a crap, which that douche isn't, would have said, 
[00:14:00]  oh, where'd you get this information?  Or then would have gone and tried to find the information so he could print it out.  But Chauncey isn't about that.  Chauncey's about just trying to make a little sensation for himself.  And to make Howie happy.  Yeah.  His whole gig in life is to try to make Howie happy.  Right.  So where'd you get that info from, Rick?  Where?  You can call our show right now.  Tell me where you got that info from. 
[00:14:30]  We're not bringing in the ad dollars, really.  The info I got, I hear we're doing just fine.  I certainly heard we're doing very well.  The only guys on radio who bring in big ad dollars are Howard Stern and Imus.  That is completely false.  Really?  The fact is there was an article about satellite radio and the ad dollars are not doing too well in satellite radio,  where Howard is exclusively heard at this point.  Yeah.  He's not bringing in ad dollars, Rick.  And Imus, if you know anything about this business, it's turning out that Citadel made a horrible deal to bring Imus on board. 
[00:15:00]  And then he writes, nobody else comes close.  You helped make them millionaires and in return you got fired.  Rick Delgado did not help us make millions.  He's baiting him with those questions is what he does.  Anthony and I, the chemistry that is Anthony and I made us millions.  We could have had a monkey producing our radio show, especially back then. 
[00:15:30]  We could have.  Right.  We could have.  And we still would have been just fine.  How did he make us millionaires?  I would love to know that.  I know.  This dope forgets that, first of all, I brought him on board in radio.  He didn't have a radio gig.  I helped him get his first radio gig at BAB.  Then he moved down to West Palm Beach, Florida, and he wanted to move back to New York because he had a fiancé.  And I said, you know what, don't move back until you have a gig.  He didn't listen to me.  He moved back to New York, and he was out of work, of course. 
[00:16:00]  And then we kind of felt sorry for him at the time because he wasn't a producer, so we brought him on board.  Right.  And we developed him.  We developed him as a producer.  Got him an unbelievable salary.  Unbelievable.  When we moved, when we were at N.E.W. here in New York, the bosses wanted to fire him because they didn't think he was a good producer.  Anthony and I walked out that day to save his gig. 
[00:16:30]  He forgets all this stuff.  Yeah, we actually left the show and said, we're not going to get on the show.  We're not going to do the show until Rick is brought back and this controversy is over and there's no threats to his job.  Right.  We said that.  We walked off the show for him.  And then in the end, I think he was the first producer in the history of radio that got an agent, hence why we didn't really want him when we came back to regular radio.  And guess who the agent is?  Our agent! 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Right.  You ungrateful F?  You helped make them millionaires and in return you got fired.  Right.  I thought they would have my back.  We had his back.  He was getting paid for four or five months.  And I talked to someone at CBS yesterday about this.  Yeah.  They go, this guy was getting, he was pretty much overpaid.  Huge.  He was making more money as a producer than anyone else in the company.  He was making a huge amount of money. 
[00:17:30]  I thought they would have my back.  I learned early on that one of those two people had my back and one of them didn't.  Rick, Anthony didn't have your back either.  He could give a flying F about you and your dumb career.  Look, if he wants to say I had his back, who's to argue?  And you know that.  Ant just doesn't like confrontation.  I...  How did he have your back, Rick?  Was he paying your bills, you dope?  Well, you know, I was there for him.  You want to fight?  We're going to fight.  Let's go. 
[00:18:00]  Fist to cuffs.  I know you've been working out in the gym, but I'm ready too, bro.  I've been doing a lot of core training lately.  You're done, man.  You better get Steven here to get in between our...  I had to get between them and break up fisticuffs.  Wait till you get to that part.  One in the back.  Yes.  I'm sure I'm a lucky boy.  When fists were flying, I make sure I'm in the room.  So one of us, so you had his back and I didn't.  I don't know what I was supposed to do.  We all got fired.  We were all getting paid.  And then he moved on to Philly and got another gig based on our radio show. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I pretty much had my back.  That was pretty much who I was.  I was taking care of numero uno.  Who didn't have your back?  And this is where it gets interesting.  Long pause.  Long pause.  Make sure you get dramatic.  And then he says, who do you think?  O.P.  Who do you think?  Who do you think?  O.P.  Really?  The guy that brought you to radio. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  I didn't have your back.  You would think those guys are friends, but they're not.  And then Truncey writes, asks, what do you mean?  What?  Whatever do you mean by that, Rick?  And this is the best part of the article, which actually made me laugh.  Let's just say I got in between them more than a couple of times.  I'm talking about fists being thrown.  All this off the air.  Now, I will go on record as saying me and Oak did have a few tiffs before the program. 
[00:19:30]  But we were professionals, so we got on the air and did the show.  They never even came close to fists being thrown in our office, in the hall, on the way, in the studio.  It just never happened.  And Rick never had to intervene in any of those discussions that we were having.  We've been doing this show for 13 years, something like that, maybe 14, coming up this summer. 
[00:20:00]  If we truly hated each other, why would we still be doing this radio show together?  I certainly could do another type of radio show.  Anthony certainly could do another type of radio show.  And we'd both be quite successful, as successful as we are now, probably not, but enough to make a fine living.  And after 13 years, of course...  Put it that way, I'm leaving.  After 13 years, of course, we've had our problems, just like any other relationship.  But to say that we've actually fought... 
[00:20:30]  That Rick had to break up, like, fights that were coming to fists.  There's never any throwing of fists.  All this off the air, Anthony.  Yeah, of course.  What do they fight about?  Just catty BS.  It was usually about someone's girlfriend coming in.  Or it was over someone playing a video game instead of prepping for the show.  Who was that?  No, Opie was constantly playing video games.  Yeah, me.  When he should have been prepping for the show. 
[00:21:00]  It's nonsense.  Neither one of you preps for the show.  Of course.  Of course.  Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the show, Rick.  And that, I was...  You're ruining the show.  And that...  We were doing afternoons.  Yeah.  So we would come in a hell of a lot earlier than we do now.  Like, now we come in about an hour before the show and go through all the newspapers and websites  and get everything together and do whatever prep we do for the show.  So back then, we'd get in at about noon for a three o'clock show. 
[00:21:30]  And know why?  Because we hated our freaking personal lives.  Of course.  You know, the one I had with your sister!  A little conflict of interest there.  Thank God the Delgados are out of my effing life.  Well, not exactly out.  Still writing stuff about you.  Oh, really?  So I would get on the computer and play video games.  It wasn't a problem.  That was part of, like, the hanging out with everybody in the office thing.  When you've got three hours before the show, you're not going to start prepping three hours 
[00:22:00]  before the show.  So I'd get on there, drink a few beers with the lunatic alcoholic Ben, and play video games.  That wasn't a problem.  And then I'd talk about the games on the air.  It was good for breaks.  It was more of a social atmosphere.  We were hanging.  Yeah.  I would look at websites, and I was actually, like, hanging Britney Spears posters, all that  crap back then.  Anthony was, like, playing video games. 
[00:22:30]  But it led to us just kind of talking about what we want to do that day.  Yeah.  This guy is full of, it's just amazing that someone like this could just get an article  printed like this, and there's no accountability whatsoever.  Because of Chauncey Douche Hayden.  We'll do part two of this article after the break.  Oh, tease.  Well, you know, because he gets into what he really thinks of me.  And he had a chance to say this to my face, and he knows that.  We were right down on the street in front of this very building probably a couple of months 
[00:23:00]  ago, and not an inkling that he was going to say any of this.  Never said it to your face.  That's for sure.  Wouldn't say it to mine because I'm so beloved.  Well, because people are scared to say it to my face.  He says that.  But he says he's not.  But he was on the sidewalk in front of us trying to get a gig at this radio station we  work for.  Yep.  Because he used to work for the PD that has since been fired.  We'll do part two of this article as an old producer is a bit jealous of our success. 
[00:23:30]  A lot of people seem to be a bit jealous of our success and love to take their shots.  We'll get into the juicy stuff.  I mean, it's really, really juicy.  What do you think of Jim Norton?  Is it good?  Oh, it's not good.  Not very good.  And Anthony, did you know that we broke up his marriage?  And did you know that when he was taking pictures of naked girls, most of them were pigs  and he didn't enjoy that?  Really?  Oh, boy.  Oh, what is this?  Hey, Rick, if you want to play, I have more dirt on you than anybody in my life. 
[00:24:00]  If you want to play, we're going to play.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  A big good morning to everybody, including Mert Snort.  Good morning.  Where are you, Mert?  Hope you're doing well.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:24:30]  Don't forget about the fine rundowns on onaradio.com.  Steven S. from Bayshore does a great job with that.  Steve rules.  And if we don't plug it every other day, he starts yelling at me through the instant feedback.  Does he?  Oh, my God.  What about onaradio.com?  What about the rundowns?  People are telling me that they read them.  People are saying. 
[00:25:00]  Where's the rest of the article?  Hey, it is April Fool's.  And a lot of people are a little nervous that we're on the air for the first time in 10 years for April Fool's.  That amazes me that it's been that long since they've allowed us on the air on April Fool's.  Yeah.  One of the things we want to do today, we're being heard in a lot of cities.  Yeah.  I want to know what your local radio station is doing for April Fool's today.  Yes.  What the hell are these hacks up to today? 
[00:25:30]  We'll start with Scott and Todd here in New York City.  Yeah.  This is what they have to say about April Fool's today.  Listen, in case you are a new listener, you're a brand new listener here on our show.  What happens to old DJs, man?  They lose their teeth.  Let me tell you.  What's that about?  Where's the DJs?  Probably all the spaceless.  All spaceless?  Let me tell you.  United Radios peoples.  What was that?  I haven't heard Scott in a long time. 
[00:26:00]  What's going on with him?  He doesn't sound like he used to at all.  He also does the voiceovers for Hannity's show, and sometimes he tries to say some of  those political names, and it's horrible.  He doesn't get over his dentures?  Yeah.  He's got to have dentures.  But he's got dentures.  I smell like Effordent.  Effordent.  Listen, in case you are a new listener, you're a brand new listener here on our show,  we don't do April Fool's Day.  Not anymore.  No.  Is it against your religion? 
[00:26:30]  Is that why you don't do it?  Shut up, the hole.  There comes the hole.  Who's the hole?  There comes the hole.  Patty Steele.  Oh, is there a problem there?  Oh.  Okay.  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  I'm actually friends with your husband now.  Don't.  I love Patty Steele.  You know, things happen over the years, and things change.  I'm sorry we said all those horrific things about you.  She's a talented woman in radio.  That's all I'm saying.  Bunch of phonies we are. 
[00:27:00]  At this point, we can't go anywhere.  There's only someone we run into that hates us.  Yes, she knows his radio.  He sounds like an old man, like really bad.  He sounds like he's our sheriff.  Yeah.  The sheriff isn't.  He looks like a Halloween mask.  Yeah.  He does.  Hey, Jimmy, don't be funny, you know.  Oh, sorry.  Hey, you're ruining the show.  Hey, we just ruined the show there.  Easy.  Sorry, Rick.  Against your religion?  Is that why you don't do it? 
[00:27:30]  I don't believe it's a question of religiosity.  It's just bored with it?  Well, it's just a little morning.  It's gone.  Passé.  You know, it's more of a third grade sort of thing.  Well, see, Scott and Todd did an April Fool's prank every single year.  Yep.  Right?  Yeah.  You rock, sell them out.  Come on.  You used to work for those fags.  To take you inside radio, a lot of radio companies pretty much have banned April Fool's pranks. 
[00:28:00]  Because it gets people in trouble.  Yep.  And so they can't say that, so they have to go on the radio and kind of spin it another way.  Also would like to take responsibility for that.  Yeah.  Well, the banning of April Fool's pranks.  And there's people who try to do it in radio.  And sometimes you'll read about them in the newspaper.  Hey, let's tell you about these guys at Omaha, what they did.  They said that the mayor was killed in a car accident today.  Omaha.  Yeah, see, the problem is a lot of those things, not so funny. 
[00:28:30]  No.  Right.  And it really doesn't take a lot of skill to go on a radio and tell you that the Lincoln  Tunnel has been blown up or shut down or whatever.  People ride.  Right.  Okay, you need to stop saying that in case someone just tunes in.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Keep things all in the up and up.  Keep it safe, everybody.  Keep it safe.  So, E-Rock.  First of all, can I just address something?  And we've done this before, and it's ancient history, but I have to address it because  they just did.  Yeah.  The reason we said that the mayor was dead all those years ago. 
[00:29:00]  Ten years ago today.  Was to show how ridiculous April Fool's gags were.  It wasn't that we seriously wanted to get on and do something like that.  It's exactly what this idiot is saying, that they're stupid.  It's that we weren't going on really going, hey, this is going to be a great April Fool's  gag.  It was to point out how ridiculous April Fool's gags are on the radio because they're so hacky. 
[00:29:30]  So we just went above and beyond ridiculous with that gag.  But everybody thinks we actually were doing an April Fool's gag.  Right.  For the sake of doing one.  Yeah, that was our whole agenda that day.  Yeah.  And Scott and Todd, they've done a million.  Scott and Jack.  Hacky April Fool's day pranks, including.  Talking without my teeth in.  Right.  That's what I'm doing this year. 
[00:30:00]  Maybe that's their April Fool's prank.  Yeah.  Hey, dude, take out your teeth today and just talk.  Do the whole show without my choppers in.  Welcome.  I'm going to live here in a glass of water by the control.  You old doddering fool.  You should be working in a ghost town out west.  Yeah.  Hey, partner.  Ladies and gentlemen, keep your hands and feet in the car at all times and get ready for  the wildest ride this side of the paycoast. 
[00:30:30]  It's the lightning train.  Big thunder lightning.  Yuck.  Ah, what a tool.  His face looks like it was sculpted out of rock.  Doesn't it?  Awful looking man.  It's worse than the Lionel Richie big clay head from the Hello video.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Back to the article that Rick Delgado, our old producer, decided to be a part of. 
[00:31:00]  Do you have the cover picture?  I have to see the photo of the cover.  Yeah.  It's Rick Nude.  Pretty much Rick Nude with a nun.  A nun.  Because he's still trying to capitalize on our sex for Sam thing.  That's hilarious.  He's edgy, this kid.  He's cutting edge, too.  Like, right there.  Right with the times.  Yeah, he's with a nun, and they're simulating sex.  Yeah, that's... 
[00:31:30]  On the cover.  That's terrific.  Oh, please, can I see that?  Oh, please.  Where's the picture?  Show James.  This dope doesn't understand that this one article,  will destroy his radio career.  Will destroy his radio career.  What was left of it.  Most people burn bridges after they cross them.  That's how stupid this guy is.  He just flames those bridges that lay right in front of him.  All right.  So, moving on with the article that he wrote about us with Chauncey Hayden. 
[00:32:00]  Stupid Chauncey Hayden.  Remember when Chauncey Hayden interviewed us when we didn't know any better?  Oh, God.  He was kissing our ass.  He was bashing Howard.  It was, you know, you guys are the next generation.  You guys rule.  Nothing but praise and compliments.  And then, you know, he turns around.  He's one of the most phony, backstabbing asses in the city. 
[00:32:30]  He's known to just be like a douche.  Nobody really likes or respects this guy at all.  He just stabs people in the back constantly.  So, we were in the middle of this before the break.  What do they fight about?  Because, see, Rick, Rick says that Ant and I hate each other.  There's a deep hatred.  A deep hatred.  Yeah.  And, oh, we did.  What do they fight about? 
[00:33:00]  Just catty BS.  It was usually about someone's girlfriend coming in or it was over someone playing a video game instead of prepping for the show.  And then he continues.  Opie just kept effing with the show when it was working fine.  Really?  Huh?  How was I effing with the show?  Why don't you explain that?  What happened?  When we left regular radio, we were number one across the board in all male demos.  We were syndicated across America.  You know, so maybe I was onto something by continually effing with the show, you idiot. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Now there are all these new people on the show that aren't needed.  It worked fine when it was just the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you think of Opie?  Oh, boy.  Now, remember, here is a guy that was a bar DJ when I met him.  I got him his first gig at BAB out there on Long Island.  Yeah.  I helped him get his gig in West Palm Beach, Florida.  When he got fired and had nowhere to go, Anthony and I hired him, even though he didn't really 
[00:34:00]  know how to produce a radio show yet.  Right.  And then we helped him become a really good producer because a lot of people know that  that's kind of my forte.  I know how to produce.  But I also want to, but I'll admit it, I'd rather be on the air than produce.  Hence the Opie and Anthony show and hiring producers.  Yeah.  So we developed him as a producer.  N.E.W. did not like the job Rick was doing.  They wanted to fire Rick.  Anthony and I walked out of N.E.W. one day. 
[00:34:30]  For the old listeners, that was one of those days where you tuned in the dial and went,  well, they didn't say they were taking a day off today because all hell was breaking loose  and we were sticking up for our guy.  Right.  We also got him an amazing salary, which was admitted to me yesterday when I was talking  to CBS, that he was way overpaid for what he was doing.  Yeah.  Okay.  Then when it was obvious that he wanted to be a star himself and he didn't really want  to produce a radio show, we helped him get an agent.  That would be our agent.  Super agent Bob Eatman. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  What do you think of Opie?  Look.  How could this be good, by the way, after that?  Right.  I know.  It's like, just stop.  Stupid Chauncey.  But it's just amazing.  You know?  Suck it up.  And then he talks about in this article how he got aft.  He didn't get paid.  He did get paid.  He didn't miss a paycheck for the most part in the last five and a half years.  What do you think of Opie?  Look, Opie's a douche and no one likes him. 
[00:35:30]  But nobody will tell that to his face because he is in a position of power over them.  Except for Ant.  He hates anyone with talent and despises listeners.  I despise the listeners.  Really?  Despised.  Really, Rick?  Why don't you explain some of this stuff?  As far as no one is brave enough to say it to my face, like Anthony brought up before the break,  we walked out of this radio station.  I think it was late summer, early fall.  And there's Rick on the sidewalk. 
[00:36:00]  Yep.  Me, Anthony, Rick staring at both of us.  He didn't say a peep.  He didn't say a word.  No.  He goes, yeah, hey, what's up, guys?  Long time no see.  It was cordial.  It was friendly.  He goes, I'm going upstairs.  I'm trying to get a gig at the station because, you know, my old boss is now the PD.  I'm like, well, good luck to you.  It was simple as that.  Simple as that.  He had the chance to say it to my face.  And nothing.  And did nothing about it.  And then, this is wonderful, after everything I've done for his career. 
[00:36:30]  I just hope he gets, can I say this?  Well, you could say it in a certain way.  I just hope he gets...  What happens to you in prison?  Yeah, in a shower.  Okay.  Yeah.  Force, forcefully.  Jimmy.  He wants you to be pretty much raped.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, rape so bad that I will blank, can I say blank?  Wait.  What? 
[00:37:00]  I don't know.  See, well, it doesn't really make sense either.  It's like he wants you to, when you have to use the bathroom, he wants nothing but water.  Right.  To end up in the toilet.  That's wonderful.  Wonderful, Rick.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  And then he has to write, is that so much to ask? 
[00:37:30]  That's some pretty deep hatred.  Yeah, well.  What do you think of their sidekick, Jim Norton?  This is what lovely Rick Delgado has to say.  I'll bet you this is going to be good.  I have a good feeling about this.  Yeah.  I think he's awesome and talented.  Oh.  There you go.  Good boy, Rick.  I also think he hurts the show.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  How so?  It started so positive.  It started good.  How so?  Jim's a comic.  That's what he does.  He's incredible at it.  But Anthony's a comedic genius in terms of his brain and how he incorporates his impressions 
[00:38:00]  into the show.  Well, this is the part of the interview that I think Rick finally hits the nail on the head  and is accurate.  Yeah.  And I think Chauncey's reporting here pretty accurate.  You want to fight?  Huh?  What?  You want to fight?  I was at the gym yesterday.  We're going to have to fight again.  I didn't want to fight.  I'm just pointing out certain parts of an article.  You have to really weigh how the article goes. 
[00:38:30]  Unfortunately, Anthony's comedic genius gets pushed aside because Jim is funny as well.  But for the opine, I guess he's calling me opine now.  What does opine mean?  I don't know what that means.  Opine and Anthony show to work.  It has to be just opine and Anthony.  What does opine?  Oh, by the way, before we just kind of move on from that, Jim Norton was the missing piece  of this whole show.  Right.  And I were doing very well on our own.  But when Jimmy came aboard, we exploded and brought so much to the show, I can't even 
[00:39:00]  tell you.  All the comedians that you know and love, Jimmy brought them all to us.  We hated comedians before we started having Jim Norton on this radio show.  Couldn't stand them.  Would avoid them at all costs.  When we were working in Boston, the comedy connection would come to us.  Hey, we got blah, blah.  We want them to do your show.  We're like, eh, comedians suck on the radio.  Jim made us see it another way.  And it's a huge piece.  I like that, but I don't really like how he interrupts my comedic genius. 
[00:39:30]  Well, I don't mean to.  Shut up.  You're right.  And hold on, opine.  Let me just say, this is my problem with what he said.  You get that sometimes when people are like, I don't like Norton on this show.  Fine.  I accept that.  I'm not going to argue about that.  My only problem with that is when I came, the show was doing extremely well, but I've  been in the show before it was ever syndicated.  I was on before syndication ever happened.  So don't act like the show, like I came in, all of a sudden the show was number one and  I walked in and it just fell into the toilet. 
[00:40:00]  It's just, what are you talking about?  I was here through the whole syndication, here through the whole sitting time, which  isn't saying much because you could, anyone can sit.  And then here's since XMX.  People don't realize how long Jimmy's been with the show.  It's about seven or eight years now.  It exploded.  And I was looking at the ratings right before we got fired.  I actually have a spreadsheet that Jeremy gave me before, probably two months before we  got fired.  Spreadsheet, Jeremy.  That's funny.  I know.  Red sheet.  He sheets.  But he showed all the markets and how we're doing. 
[00:40:30]  And we were destroying in all these cities.  Not even close.  No one was close to us.  I think in Cleveland alone, we had like 30 shares in the mail demo.  So how is Jimmy wrecking the show yet?  You ungrateful F.  Call me that.  We'll come to blows.  And then, of course, because this is the old argument.  What does Opine bring to the show?  Very, very long pause.  That's in parentheses.  Very, very long pause. 
[00:41:00]  And then he writes, can I get back to you next week on that?  See, I bring nothing to the show.  That's what he was implying, I think.  I get paid a ridiculous salary to sit here and do absolutely nothing.  Don't you think the company would love to save the money if I wasn't doing anything?  You're obviously upset with Opie.  Have you ever spoken to him about how you feel?  Why bother?  He comes from the Bill Clinton camp of lie, lie, and lie.  This guy's stuck in, like, 1996. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, Opine equals Jackass, I guess?  What?  I guess.  That's what someone's saying.  Really?  That's hilarious.  Lie, lie, lie.  Why don't you explain what I lied about, Rick?  However, Anthony and I have talked.  But to be honest, I'm glad I'm not producing the show anymore.  Every day.  I ran my course.  The show helped destroy my marriage.  Really?  People are going to think that's real.  You don't talk to Rick every day. 
[00:42:00]  Help me out here a little bit.  Would I?  These dopes believe anything you say.  Now we will fight.  Let's go.  Old school?  Yeah.  Marcus, Duchess, Marcus of Queensberry rule.  Which one is it, Dan?  Jack Johnson fighting where your elbows are up.  I want to fight just like the Notre Dame mascot guy.  Yeah.  That's what I want to fight like.  Yeah.  Why am I doing it?  I'm actually doing it, and my stupid Peltow camera doesn't even work, so no one's seeing this.  I'm an ass. 
[00:42:30]  Why bother?  He comes from the Bill Clinton camp of lie, lie, lie.  I don't really know what that means because he didn't explain.  However, Anthony and I have, okay, doesn't want to produce the show anymore.  I ran my course.  The show helped destroy my marriage.  The show helped destroy my marriage.  Really, Rick?  It was the radio show.  Yeah.  How about we talk about the rumors?  Oh. 
[00:43:00]  Maybe your wife was onto you finally.  Hmm.  That's all I'm saying.  Hmm.  You want to play?  We'll play, Rick.  Yes.  There were certain rumors that were running rampant around the studio.  How many numbers did you get from the girls you were photographing naked, Rick?  Hmm.  How many?  Hmm.  But the show, well, maybe the show technically did ruin, you know,  his marriage because he was looking at what he could possibly get. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  It's rumor and innuendo.  There were stories going about of infidelity, things like that.  But, you know, I never saw the guy with any other girls or anything, aside from the photographing  them on the couch, posing them in different poses.  Usually when you're at a radio station and a guy is taking pictures of nude girls in the  station, they stand there and you snap pictures. 
[00:44:00]  Rick would pose them on the couch, gently touching them and moving their arms and head and hips  about, using his hands like he thought he was this photographer, like a model photographer.  And he would maul the girls as they're laying there on the couch.  Well, it was an ongoing, like, thing with the radio show.  Oh, there goes Rick again, flirting with the girls. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  What that led to?  Ah.  Who knows?  Rick knows, though.  But it ruined his marriage, he says.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  The radio show ruined his marriage.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  The show helped destroy my marriage.  It puts so much strain on you.  I was prepping for the show six hours a day.  Really, Rick?  No.  No, you weren't.  And taking lots of pictures of naked girls.  That's what he was prepping for. 
[00:45:00]  And I read this next line to my fiance.  The next line is, many of those girls you wouldn't want to see naked.  That's just what we did.  Now, let me tell you something.  We've been, let's also say what E-Rock's been doing for the past 20 minutes, actually.  Oh, 20?  Okay.  He's been popping up pictures that Rick took back at the N.E.W. of these girls.  And it's nothing but, like, hot girls. 
[00:45:30]  One after another.  All posed like Rick would pose them.  Where are the slobs that he's talking about?  Of course there were slobs.  I was talking to my girl last night.  I'm like, I would love to tell you that is the truth.  Because it would probably make it a little easier for you.  Thinking, oh, a lot of times when these girls were naked in the studio, they were ugly messes and you were just doing your job.  And I actually looked at my girl and I went, they were hot as hell.  This guy is the biggest liar ever.  There were some slobs, but the majority, you know, were attractive girls. 
[00:46:00]  You wouldn't take so many pictures of just slobs.  Right.  Opine equals express one's opinion openly and without fear or hesitation.  All right.  Thank you.  That's a compliment.  Compliment.  Did I say compliment?  That's a compliment, Mikey.  Many of the girls, you wouldn't want to see naked.  That's just what we did.  Is there any way to fix your career?  That's a good question.  I don't think it needs fixing.  I think radio needs fixing.  Yeah, man. 
[00:46:30]  Look at all these ugly girls.  Really?  The hell is that?  Really?  Can we do a montage of ugly girls that Rick took pictures of?  You're not going to find one in the batch I'm looking at.  Those little cones.  Yeah, that's ugly.  And every one you see, he posed them by hand.  He walked over to them.  And like that girl, the one we're looking at now, she's sitting kind of on the couch, 
[00:47:00]  but leaned way over.  He absolutely would have put his hand on her back and pushed her forward a little bit,  grabbed her arms, and made her grab her own chest.  Yeah.  You know, it was taking him so long to take pictures of these girls, it was becoming a  problem.  Yeah, it was a problem.  I'm like, Rick, when are you going to produce the show?  It was a problem.  I think radio needs fixing.  Man!  If you could do one final shocking thing on radio, what would it be? 
[00:47:30]  I can't tell you.  I really can't.  I have it in my mind, and I've been sitting on it since the O&A show.  I was going to share it with the show at some point.  Sitting on his mind?  If you read that literally.  Yeah.  Had it on my mind, and I've been sitting on it.  I don't really want to say it, but think our Bud Dwyer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can only do it once.  I was going to share it with the show at some point, but then everything went bad,  so I've kept it to myself.  Only my ex-wife knows what it is besides me. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah?  And she promises to keep it a secret until I do it.  What?  Fidelity?  All I can tell you is that it's incredible, and that it breaks no FCC rules or violations.  Nobody can be fined for it.  It's genius.  Is it, Rick?  Is it really?  Rick Delgado, super genius.  And then the article continues.  We don't have to spend too much more time on this, but basically it talks about the tsunami 
[00:48:30]  song he did, and this is why it'll be tough for him to get a job, because he doesn't know  how to play the game in this day and age in radio.  He says, let's take We Are The World and change the words just as a goof.  Talking about the tsunami song that got him fired again.  I remember the video of the mom floating dead on her back while her kid is crying, and  I thought, comedy gold.  That's what he writes.  Yeah.  Comedy gold. 
[00:49:00]  You know, we could be the most despicable people on the air.  I can accept that.  But I don't know about seeing that and thinking comedy gold.  I think you could comment on it on the air.  I think you might even be able to peripherally find some comedy somewhere.  But I don't see that and think comedy gold.  But he does.  He does. 
[00:49:30]  Good for you.  I think in a way, too, he doesn't like the fact that I took the spot that I think he felt  was his.  He wanted.  Oh, yeah.  Which is the role I do because then, like, when I started coming in, I noticed more and  more it was like I was sitting there and he wasn't.  Right.  And the only argument he and I ever had was one time he tried to kind of be my boss.  And that was the only argument that we ever had.  It was because I was in the bathroom banging a girl over the toilet. 
[00:50:00]  Remember that bathroom where the creep would hang out?  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He used to make fun of him all the time.  And I had a stripper in there and we were having sex standing up over the toilet and  he yelled at me, scolded me for going back there.  And I went back on the next break and, you know, finished.  Yeah.  And I'm a nice guy.  Yeah.  There you go.  And that was the only time we ever had an argument.  What comes down to this?  A lot of jealousy, obviously.  The guy has burned a lot of bridges with this article.  I know the company we work for will not hire him anytime soon. 
[00:50:30]  A lot of people, they finally get the answer to this question.  Why didn't Rick produce the show when you guys came back to radio?  Yes.  A lot of people were asking that.  And, you know, he was a good producer, not a great producer.  But the problem with Rick was he wanted to have his own radio show and we couldn't be bothered with that anymore.  And he went on to do his own radio show and it failed miserably, okay?  But that's what he wanted from his career.  And we weren't looking for a producer that was going to try to get a lot of air time, get into the shots when the TV crews came in here, 
[00:51:00]  all of a sudden just try to get his face on camera.  Oh, he'd always have to bring something in or come behind us during a shot from one of the news cameras.  He'd talk to the person that was doing the interview, so they would interview him to try to get his take on the show.  He's constantly trying to worm his way into television interviews.  It was all about Rick and trying to get attention. 
[00:51:30]  And the type of show we wanted to do when we came back to radio, quite frankly, he didn't have the skills to produce that type of show.  Simple as that.  And as far as not having his back, I can't even express how ridiculous that is.  How ridiculous.  Everyone got paid when we got fired.  And I got paid more.  And the only reason we got paid more, meaning time-wise, was because they were trying to keep us off the air.  Because at the time, they didn't want us to go to actually Q104 and do mornings up against Howard.  That was a fact.  The truth of the matter is, we didn't want to sit and be paid. 
[00:52:00]  And that's the God's honest truth.  It killed us to sit there and just be paid.  It sounds great, but we didn't want to.  We wanted to get another gig and do radio for two years, not sit off.  And before you guys say, boo-hoo, poor you guys, we knew we could make the same amount of money working for somebody else.  So it wasn't about the money.  We wanted the money and to continue with our careers.  Yeah, I'm just saying it that way because when you get somebody like Rick saying, well, I got paid, I didn't. 
[00:52:30]  We would rather have not been fired.  We'd rather have been able to not be under contract and get a gig somewhere else.  Right.  We were under contract.  We had to sit there and get paid.  Boo-hoo.  And what were we supposed to do?  Start giving him money?  He had a gig.  He had a really good gig.  But he F's up his career every step of the way because he wants to be a star himself. 
[00:53:00]  Over the top, Rick.  You know, I hate Preston and Steve, and I hate Rick for a basic reason that he went down there and gave Preston and Steve a lot of our bits.  It's a known fact at this point.  Yeah.  But he had a good gig down there with a show that is killing in Philly, and he walked away from it because he's stupid.  We have nothing to do with that.  And then he had a really nice gig here in New York City.  He wrecked that, too.  So we're supposed to pick him up every time he falls on his ass and pay him and support him or something?  For what? 
[00:53:30]  Jesus.  Get a hold of yourself.  By the way, how's the painting company, Rick?  Oh, what's that about?  Yeah.  Oh, did he...  I know somebody that was a reference, and, well, this guy got a phone call from a painting company.  Uh-huh.  That's how well Rick is doing with his career.  Ooh.  No.  Oh, and by the way, you didn't get a good reference. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, no.  Ooh.  That'll hurt.  And, yeah, a bit of a conflict, too.  And, you know, you got a brother and a sister.  The sister's going out with the guy, and then they break up, and then the brother, of course, has a little bit of an attitude.  Well, you know, he...  I always kind of separated the two things, but I guess you're right, but...  Yeah.  You know, I...  It's possible. 
[00:54:30]  I walked to the elevators one night at NEW with Anthony.  This was, this was, unfortunately, a good two years before I ended my relationship with Rick's sister.  And I actually said to Anthony, I know he'll back me up.  We're getting on the elevator, and I said to him, I cannot wait to get the Delgados out of my life!  Yeah.  And I'm proud to say I sit here, still doing great with my career, and I got the Delgados out of my life! 
[00:55:00]  Except for an occasional article that comes out.  He's just bad people.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  And stupid people, too, because this isn't going to help him and his radio career.  It's not going to help at all.  He's just one guy.  All right, we're going to get into our radio show for today.  Ooh.  Looking for what your city's doing for April Fool's.  I'm sure the pranks are just flying by now.  Oh, hysterical. 
[00:55:30]  April Fool's pranks.  And then I'm sure we got an exclusive from E-Rock and Sam, because they were down at WrestleMania when all hell broke loose, right?  I guess they were saving this for when they came back, because there was not a heap of it on the phone the other day when they called from the event of this fireworks problem that they had at WrestleMania.  It's all over the news.  We had live people there on the scene.  But like I said, I guess they were saving it for today. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  What's that?  When I was starting out on radio at N.E.W., there was nothing worse than being sent out on street teams events with Rick.  All the promotions people knew it.  He would act like he was the biggest star radio has ever seen and treated everyone like S.  This is too funny, because I was just thinking about how much he loved taking pics of the girls that would come into the station.  The girls would always be so creeped out by how into it he was.  Mrs. Delgado.  That's another eyewitness.  Check in then. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, okay.  Another eyewitness checking in.  Interesting.  Comes down to that.  Rick wanted to be the star, and we just couldn't deal with that anymore.  We needed a producer that wanted to produce a radio show and stay behind the scenes for the most part.  So we parted ways.  We parted ways in a good way, by the way.  He went on to Philly, and he did his thing.  He wrecked that.  He wrecked his gig in New York.  We had nothing to do with it.  So leave us out of your crap. 
[00:57:00]  It's over.  What, do you want to date me now, too?  Ooh.  You're implying he's a homo.  I don't know.  Why is he obsessed with me five, six years later?  Probably wants to make out with me.  How could he not?  Exactly, Jim.  But I'm not into you-know-whats anymore.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:57:30]  Still going strong, by the way.  I want to say good morning to all my haters.  Go f' yourselves.  Phone number 877-212-0-8.  Yeah, the list continues to grow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bow, bow, bow. 
[00:58:00]  It's April Fool's Day.  Who won?  What?  Who won the big March Bracket Brawl here in New York?  Well.  A bit of an upset, Anthony.  Oh, was it?  Last we left you.  Yes.  The March...  What are they calling it?  March Bracket Brawl.  Let's call it Rock Madness.  Rock Madness.  We all know the...  Probably taken by some other stations.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, last we left you was down in the Final Four. 
[00:58:30]  You had Pearl Jim up against Tool, and you had Zeppelin up against Metallica.  Yes.  In separate brackets.  This, of course, all the rock stations I think were doing this, and ours here in New York that we're on did it.  Take the March Madness-style brackets from college basketball and put rock bands in there.  Yeah.  And how to battle it out, I guess.  Yeah.  They played the music, let the listeners decide and vote, and wow, we got down to the Final Four.  Zeppelin against Metallica, Pearl Jam against Tool. 
[00:59:00]  And I begged our listeners to vote for Tool to win the whole thing.  Did ya?  I'm so glad we have such power with our listeners, because Tool lost to Pearl Jam.  Oops.  Thanks for helping us out.  And then Metallica beat Zeppelin.  In a huge upset.  Oh, good.  Huge upset.  Yes.  Good.  And so it was Metallica versus Pearl Jam, and Metallica took it all.  Yes.  Yeah.  Metallica took it all in the March bracket brawl here at K-Rock here in New York. 
[00:59:30]  Good.  Where we broadcast our flagship station, Opie.  Our flagship station.  Oh, boy.  As they call it.  Flagship.  Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, where's a lifeboat?  I need to lower it down the side.  Can we transfer the flag?  Well, David Hinckley, who writes for radio here in New York City, he had to write about  the March bracket brawl that this station's doing.  He writes, Metallica beat Pearl Jam yesterday afternoon in the finals of the... 
[01:00:00]  He wrote about this in the newspaper?  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Oh, sorry.  This is in the radio column of the New York newspaper.  They wrote about the March bracket brawl.  Yeah.  Yeah, they did.  What happened?  A transmitter cable didn't snap yesterday for him to write about?  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And our boys, Toucher and Rich, they do afternoons, of course, in Boston. 
[01:00:30]  Yep.  They do a great job on WBCN.  They're the main story at page six today here in New York City.  How many Deewees does that make now?  Well, it's not Deewee-related?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  I just assumed.  Seriously, this guy isn't funny.  Not funny.  By the way...  Not funny.  Maybe not...  That's you in Cleveland, Evan.  Maybe not a popular thing to say, but I think Dane Cook is funny. 
[01:01:00]  I really do, and I'm going to go on record and say it.  Wow.  Because a lot of people love jumping on the Dane Cook is not funny bandwagon.  But the page six article featuring Toucher and Rich are our pals, it says,  Seriously, this guy isn't funny.  Damn it.  There's nothing amusing about Dane Cook, according to fellow comics and two Boston Radio DJs  who are about to name him the unfunniest comic this afternoon.  BCN jock Fred Toucher.  He would be the alcoholic of the two.  Fred Toucher.  Is the drunk?  Which co-hosts a talk show with Rich. 
[01:01:30]  Rich, excuse me.  The enabler.  Schurtenleib.  Rich, the codependent.  Right, codependent.  Fall down and codependent.  You're on the air.  All I know is the last time I saw Toucher and Rich, didn't he come to work in his pajamas  or something?  I think he was in his PJs.  Or slippers.  He had something going on that wasn't right.  Well, they say Cook is an overwhelming favorite in a tournament patterned after NCAA basketball 
[01:02:00]  March Madness, where he's ahead of Jay Leno, Jeff Foxworthy, Carlos Mencia, and Paula Poundstone.  We're talking about how people laugh out loud at nonsense, and Dane is a good example of that.  Toucher told page six.  Oh, laugh out loud at nonsense.  Okay.  We listened to him, and at the end of four minutes, he changed subjects, and that was  it.  We couldn't figure out when the joke was.  And he's actually hated.  People don't hate others the way they do him.  At least Foxworthy panders to rednecks. 
[01:02:30]  Dane's stories are so weak, you wouldn't want to hear them over lunch.  A bit of a hammering for Dane.  I disagree, but this is why I do love Toucher and Rich as a radio show.  They got balls.  Not many people with balls these days on the radio.  It's nice to see.  They're saying this about Dane Cook in his home city, where he does quite well.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, they even have some of his stats in here.  He's a triple platinum artist who sold 32,000 tickets on his last tour in Boston alone.  32,000.  He pre-sold the Boston Garden, and I think it's the first time it's ever been done as fast.  He pre-sold it faster than most bands, or all bands.  Wow.  Yeah.  It makes you feel good as a comic.  While I'm in Portland this weekend doing 300 people, I hope my next plane crashes.  Yeah, well, save that.  Well, Dane did two shows.  Two shows at the old Boston Garden, which is the old Fleet Center, which is... 
[01:03:30]  I can't keep track of these stadiums anymore.  Yeah, whatever it is now.  Well, Toucher bought out all the beer at the Boston Garden once.  Yeah.  I know that happened.  Sure.  I think this article is being a bit nitpicky, though, because it says the stars of such movie  stinkers as Employee of the Month and Good Luck Chuck allegedly was also once tossed at  a Smith & Walensky Steakhouse because he was so difficult.  His assistant ordered for him.  He got a steak and sent it back three times to one employee.  The chef was furious.  We told him enough is enough. 
[01:04:00]  If that's the big dirt they're pulling on him, like, he sent a steak back three times.  Wow.  It's like, come on.  He's a madman.  And then they have this to say, and one insider on the set of the TBS World Series commercials  cook film last year said he demanded blocks of tickets for postseason games in return for  filming the commercials for free.  Well...  What's wrong with that?  That's terrible.  You're doing the commercials for free.  How about a few tickets?  Wanted tickets to the event for doing free?  Wow, that's terrible.  That's not really that bad. 
[01:04:30]  I mean...  I think Dane Cook lost out of the deal, right?  I know.  Dane, you idiot.  You could have got $600,000 or a million for that commercial.  Paid, dummy.  I would imagine filming a World Series commercial could be hundreds of thousands of dollars  and all the guy wanted was a few tickets.  I'm not doing this unless I get a hat.  And then, of course, Cook's people say that he doesn't recall ever being to Smith and Walensky.  He did go to Houston's Smith and Walensky when he was in town a few weeks ago and ordered 
[01:05:00]  chicken, which he did not send back.  You know, guys that have a legitimate issue with Dane, whether it was him and Louie and  they went back and forth, and apparently Dimitri, I didn't know, and Rogan and Dane have had  like a public thing, or Rogan certainly doesn't like Dane.  Oh, yeah.  But that's about a professional thing, but to say the guy is just the unfunniest comic,  it's just stupid.  I mean, it's like you can't say he doesn't make you laugh on any level or doesn't make  you laugh.  It's just a dumb thing because he's the biggest actor right now.  Well, I know people don't like him.  They don't like his style of comedy, which is fine, but I think there are other comedians, 
[01:05:30]  like Paula Poundstone.  Holy mother of God.  I think Paula Poundstone, though, isn't a big enough name these days to...  to elect as the worst comic.  You know, you'd want someone like Dane, somebody that's really hot and sells out huge stadiums.  Jimmy and I went to the Dane Cook show in Boston a few years back.  Isn't he dreamy?  Yeah, really hot.  We used to touch his arms.  We sat there in like the 10th row or something, and you could see the jealousy on our faces. 
[01:06:00]  Really?  We were like, look what this guy is doing in one night.  Sold out the whole thing, and then we leave, and there's a line that goes about...  I don't know, a half a mile for the people that are coming to the second show.  Yeah.  I tried to wreck it so bad, because I was walking by the entire line saying, show's canceled.  Show's canceled.  Leave.  Leave.  Show's canceled.  Try playing Call of Duty 4 with the guy.  He runs around with a knife and stabs you.  It's annoying.  I vote him the worst Call of Duty 4 player ever. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  He's a Call of Duty friend of Anthony's.  Bastard.  And then I saw him at the guard.  I see him whenever I can.  And I sat in the...  Actually, he gave me front row tickets for the guard show, and I'm sitting there in amazement  again, because I'm thinking to myself, here's a guy.  Here's a guy.  Every time I hear, here's a guy.  He's doing comedy in the round at Madison Square Garden with a stool.  That was it.  No backing band.  No lasers.  Nothing.  It was just him doing comedy, and no one was bored. 
[01:07:00]  As opposed to...  Yeah, the attention of Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  As opposed to when he toured with Bob Kelly, where he was doing comedy with a tool.  I think Mert Snort enjoyed that one, Jimmy.  Where is Mert today?  All right.  Well, congratulations to Touch and Rich, though.  That's pretty cool.  Page six here in New York City for the boys.  That two afternoons on this fine radio station in Boston.  Did they pick the comics, or did they just take submissions or throw out a bunch of names? 
[01:07:30]  I'm going to guess that...  Do you really think Toucher would, like, do that much work?  Oof.  Well, I don't know if the stats came up with him.  Cuts into drinking time.  Sure.  He was one of those things they threw around at the bar while he's getting hammered.  Didn't he make an awful first impression for us?  Oh, boy, did he.  I've never seen someone so intoxicated.  Me?  It was great.  Last time we were up there, it was for the Halloween party.  Yeah.  And, wow.  Oh, I've never seen someone so drunk and still almost walk. 
[01:08:00]  And you're you.  And I'm me, for God's sake.  And you're you.  Jeez.  Because I'm looking going, wow, Anthony could drink, but this guy, I think, could out-drink  Anthony.  Wow.  Or maybe he doesn't handle himself as well as you do when you're drunk.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Perhaps he was on some kind of narcotics, too.  Who am I to say?  He was just...  No, he was just very...  He was fun.  I'll give you that.  He was snoted.  He was gone at that Halloween party.  We were trying to talk to him a little bit, and he's just like... 
[01:08:30]  He does a great interview, though.  I'll say that much.  I walked in there.  He was really informed, and he was a fun guy to do an interview with.  But I'm like, this is the guy who's doing so...  Honest to God, he should be wearing a hospital clothing directing traffic.  He should just be standing out in the middle of Fifth Avenue somewhere, just...  He was pointing at a green light, and, you know...  I should have just cut that at one joke, but I got green.  That's okay.  Hence ruining the show.  He would have fit in perfectly in that movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as one of 
[01:09:00]  the people doing a little group therapy, man.  He would have fit right in.  Nicholson should be trying to get him to vote to watch the World Series.  All right.  Comes back strong.  Oh, Mert Snort.  Thumbs up for Mert Snort on that one, too, Jimmy.  You're killing with Mert today.  April Fools.  Yes.  We're in the middle of it here.  Are we doing a gag?  I don't know yet.  We're thinking.  But, uh...  You won't know.  You just won't know, because it'll be so original and outrageous. 
[01:09:30]  You'll go, oh, it's gotta be true.  You hear about the epilepsy website?  I did hear about this.  Was this for April Fools?  I don't...  Well, maybe for April Fools, but, um...  I'm not sure if, uh...  I gotta tell you, this one's brilliant.  Listen to this.  Hackers have long been known to cause trouble online, or steal money, or even make a political statement.  But recently, a group of hackers carried out what may have been the first computer-based assault to cause people physical harm.  And a warning.  If you have photosensitive epilepsy, please consider turning away from your TV. 
[01:10:00]  And I clicked on the link, and it was a vivid, flashing image.  For Jenny Miller, the hurtful images came up so fast that she had no time to react.  Immediately, I started having problems.  Recently, when Jenny surfed the message boards at the Epilepsy Foundation website,  she came across animated, pornographic images so disgusting, we can't show them.  It was a scary thing.  But their flashing nature is similar to these ones.  As a result of seeing them, Jenny suffered intense migraines that lasted several days. 
[01:10:30]  Security experts believe the offending images were planted by a group of hackers in a deliberate attempt to harm people.  You know, when I read stories like this, the first thing I think of is,  Oh, boy, what do the pests do now?  Oh, no.  Right down our alley, man.  We know how bad they are when it comes to hacking and stuff.  Well, the Olympic logo, remember that was...  Can we have the Al Roker clip at all?  Well, Al Roker kind of made fun of epilepsy with the Olympic logo was causing problems for 2007. 
[01:11:00]  Wasn't this right around the Imus controversy, Jimmy?  A couple months after, I believe, yeah.  Do you have that clip?  And a little update on a story we told you about yesterday.  Remember that controversial Olympic logo for the 2012 Olympics in London?  Well, some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into epileptic seizures.  Others say it's just downright ugly.  Well, we asked you to weigh in on our website in an informal poll.  And those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around, you were able... 
[01:11:30]  Oof.  Do you have...  Can I...  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  Do you have the apology?  This is amazing because he was doing exactly what Imus was doing at the time.  I know we've been down to it a lot.  But he was just trying to make people laugh and entertain them.  And everyone in the background laughing at the image that...  Al Roker painted an image right there of an epileptic flopping around on the floor.  And people were laughing. 
[01:12:00]  That's exactly what he did.  And then when you listen to his apology, this douche just tries to make it sound like that's not what he did.  You just heard what he said.  He was making a joke about an epileptic flopping on the floor.  And when they can get up...  And then he has an apology that I don't think quite covers it.  All right.  I do want to take care of one thing, though.  Yesterday at this time, we were talking about that 2012 London Olympics logo and how hideous it was.  And how people were being... suggested that they were having epileptic seizures by this thing. 
[01:12:30]  And I started joking about it.  And I want to make sure... I want to make this clear.  I was not joking about epilepsy or anybody who suffers from epilepsy.  We understand and know that that is a serious affliction and would never joke about that.  Joking about the logo, not about epilepsy.  And if anybody was offended by that, I heartily and really humbly apologize that I was not trying to make fun of anybody who suffers from that affliction in their family. 
[01:13:00]  So if you were offended, I apologize.  Just want to make that clear.  Let's take a look, show you what's going on as far as your weather is concerned.  Our pick city of the day happens to be Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Al.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Who doesn't?  What a liar.  Oh, someone was told to get on TV immediately and apologize.  And apologize and then paint it over like he was making fun of the logo. 
[01:13:30]  It's not the logo that flops around on the floor.  And then can't get up.  What is he talking about?  Way to go.  Wow.  You big fat word I can't use.  He should have used what he should have done was show it in the clip from the day before.  And then apologize for showing the clip.  Yeah.  Here's what I said.  And now here's my apology.  That makes no sense.  Yeah.  Because I was making fun of epileptics.  Yeah.  How hilarious is that, though, that these hackers did that? 
[01:14:00]  I first went on the air this morning.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  I was reading that in the post and I was just laughing.  I was just laughing out loud at what pricks people are.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  That's just a scummy move.  Absolutely.  All right.  We have to take another break here.  We got an exclusive because our boys took about two days off from the show.  Went down to WrestleMania.  Yeah.  We talked to them yesterday.  They didn't mention the whole fireworks malfunction thing that happened at WrestleMania. 
[01:14:30]  I guess dozens of people injured.  Injured?  There was a huge fireworks malfunction.  Yeah.  And lucky us.  We had two of our guys down there when this was going on.  Thank God.  What are the odds?  And now they can report.  Right.  Eyewitness report.  Right.  On this fireworks tragedy.  Right.  And we talked to them yesterday.  And obviously, they didn't mention it yesterday.  So I'm assuming they really wanted to get their thoughts together.  And do it live on our show today instead of during that phone call yesterday. 
[01:15:00]  And I think to surprise us because they had such nothing on the phone.  Right.  It was so boring and nothing that they must have been holding this in thinking, ha ha, this  is going to be good.  We pretty much ruined the show by having such crap on the phone.  But when we get back, we have this exclusive that we witnessed of a fireworks tragedy at  WrestleMania.  And these guys are good.  I'm thinking Eyewitness reports, audio. 
[01:15:30]  It's got to be just all encompassing.  I think this is going to get us right to the end of the show at this point.  Unbelievable.  Who else had guys actually there when this all went down?  Well, Eyewitness account coming up.  We're going to be talking to Jose Canseco a little later on this morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  And Stephen S. from Bayshore is an a-hole.  Why?  The answer to your question, Steve, dead, okay, and no. 
[01:16:00]  I think I know what it was.  We're doing a little car neck right now, I guess, because now the instant feedback.  Hey, Opie, we need a few things updated.  Is Tom, in fact, alive?  How is Thang getting along with Mother? 
[01:16:30]  And does All The Way May still take it in the...  In the...  In the...  In the...  Oh, uh, yeah.  The most dirty of places.  Right.  Stephen, you're going to piss off Mert Snort, and you don't want to do that.  You don't want to piss off Mert Snort.  Where's Sam for his exclusive WrestleMania thing?  I know.  Well, let's set it up with the story, Anthony. 
[01:17:00]  This is what happened at WrestleMania on Sunday.  Who knew?  Yeah, we didn't know, and we talked to the guys yesterday.  They were hiding it from us, I guess.  Yeah, this is the story.  In Orlando, this amateur video shows a crowd in chaos after being hit by fireworks at the  WrestleMania Citrus Bowl.  More than 40 people suffered burns and were treated at a nearby hospital.  Investigators say a cable holding the fireworks collapsed at the end of the show.  The fire was not shown during the pay-per-view broadcast of that event. 
[01:17:30]  The WWE issued a public apology to those who were injured.  Chaos, fireworks hitting people, 40 injured.  The best part of that story is the amateur video.  Yeah.  Now, if you want to picture what the amateur video looks like, take whatever video device you have.  Try to get as old a one as possible.  Right.  Maybe one with a big VHS tape.  Right.  That slides in there.  Tie a big rope around this.  Uh-huh. 
[01:18:00]  Put the rope around your neck.  Yeah.  And without using your hands, just run around frantically.  Yeah.  That's what the video looked like.  I think that might be too clear.  Really?  Yeah.  I think what you need to do is actually strap it to a chimp's head and then just throw bananas  and rocks at him.  And as he goes crazy, that's the video that you'll see.  It looks just like the amateur video taken of WrestleMania at the fireworks display. 
[01:18:30]  This could be the worst cameraman ever, ever, ever.  Well, we're very lucky, Anthony.  Uh, we have, uh, Sam and E-Rock in studio right now.  Now, they took two days off from the Opie and Anthony show to go down to WrestleMania.  And this is the reason they went, just in case something like this happens.  And silly us.  I feel like a fool now because we were mocking them.  We were really, and getting angry at the company for sending them for two days.  And now I feel like an idiot because, uh, we have an exclusive. 
[01:19:00]  We have guys that were on scene for a story that is hitting the news today.  And, uh, is, is huge.  Thank God.  People injured in a fireworks display at WrestleMania.  And I don't have the exclusive, uh, eyewitness, uh, interviews yet.  Because I'm sure they're still cutting it up in the office, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  And you're saying basically, like, the, why would they mention it yesterday before everyone  else had it as opposed to today when it's everywhere.  Well, Jimmy, they're smart radio guys in the end because, like, we, we woke them up at 
[01:19:30]  6 a.m. yesterday.  And they know not a lot of people are listening to a morning show at 6.  No.  They'd rather save it for around 7.45, which is, which is basically prime time listening.  Yep.  Right.  Perfect.  Without further ado, uh, we got E-Rock and Sam.  So, uh, chaos, fireworks hitting, uh, spectators, 40 injured with burns.  Burns.  A collapsed, uh, fireworks, uh, display.  Yeah.  A cable broke.  I mean, it sounds, it sounds, well, what it is, chaotic.  Right.  Just people running for their lives. 
[01:20:00]  We, we hand it over to you.  What do you got?  The news might have slightly sensationalized the event, believe it or not, because.  Not?  Well, there wasn't, there was no chaos, per se, except maybe amongst those 40.  And when you have a group of 40 in a mass of 74,000, you can't tell.  We left, it was while the show was ending.  So, so, okay, here's, here's the report now.  It's starting.  So the show's ending.  Remember, they took two days off from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  This is what we get.  So the show is ending.  The show is ending.  You felt safe.  I felt very safe.  You felt safe, which, uh, you know, that was probably shattered by the time, uh, this  cable snapped and fireworks are, uh, flying all over the place.  But at that point, you felt safe.  Well, the Undertaker just won the world title.  So, yeah, I felt safe.  Oh, okay.  So the fireworks are coming down from the top of the Citrus Bowl.  Yep.  And they're zooming down the whole arena and everybody's like, wow.  Oh, here it comes.  Look at these fireworks.  Oh, boy.  And then, uh, all of a sudden, the people in the row behind me are looking up, 
[01:21:00]  way up, uh, directly behind us at the top, top section of the arena where, uh, I, where  one of the, uh, fireworks had, instead of going straight down through the arena, went into  the crowd.  Oh, my God.  It was unbelievable.  And, uh, all of us, all we saw was people rushing to the scene with fire extinguishers.  Uh-huh.  And they got everything out.  There was no big flames or anything, thank God.  No.  Because they had the situation under control. 
[01:21:30]  And even with, uh, all this chaos ensuing in that section, they were able to, uh...  When did you think you were going to die?  Well, at first, I said, this could be serious.  There's still fireworks going off.  Right.  What if they hit our section here on the floor?  Uh-huh.  Plus, we were sitting with all the, uh, Make-A-Wish kids.  Ah.  So that would have been a huge tragedy.  Would it really, if you think about it?  Well, Make-A-Wish, well.  Because it's like... 
[01:22:00]  Kind of takes that waiting thing out of it.  I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.  Really?  Thank you, Barack.  Wow.  And then, you know, there's all these people, everybody's looking up, saying, well, where's  the next firework going to hit?  Yeah.  Or is it a terrorist attack?  We don't know because...  Wow.  ...bombs, we don't know.  Who knows?  And, finally, we're able to exit after the firework display has concluded.  Huh?  We're confident in the fact that there won't be any more fireworks exploding on us. 
[01:22:30]  And, uh, we were able to exit with the other 74,000 people.  So, could you show us, uh, the burns that I'm sure you've suffered, perhaps, underneath  your...  Because I don't see any, uh, facial, thank God, uh, or on your hands or anywhere exposed,  but I'm sure, uh, your burns are probably very painful, uh, and if you want to, I'm not  doing this out of, you know, I don't want to degrade you in any way, but I would like  to see, uh, how badly you were injured.  Well, believe it or not, as, uh... 
[01:23:00]  Not!  Well, okay.  It was about 40 people were injured.  I was one of the lucky 74,000 that was not effective.  He obviously wasn't close to the mishap because his hair would have went off.  Look at this huge afro of his.  That would have been the first thing to go.  A flashbulb.  Yeah.  You would have seen birds flying out of it and deer running.  E-Rock, you got anything to add to the story considering you wasted two days?  Um, and blew off the show for two days?  E-Rock, uh, took a stick with marshmallows on it and just put it over the fire. 
[01:23:30]  Held them over a burning person.  Unfortunately, E-Rock found out about the, uh, uh, firework mishap on Monday morning,  uh, while we were driving, uh, back to, home from the airport in New York when I told him,  yes, there was a big fireworks thing that happened there.  Oh, really?  I saw people looking and didn't know what was going on.  Ah, really?  I thought it was part of the, part of the big finale because they were shooting.  People being burned?  Wait, people, people on fire running for the exits was part of the finale. 
[01:24:00]  The next finale of Wrestlemania.  I know Vince is crazy, but.  Yeah.  I want people machine gunned down as they leave.  That's right.  You know, this is going to be the biggest Wrestlemania yet.  Not only are we going to have The Undertaker win, but right afterwards, I want bombs going  off of the place.  That's right.  I want people's limbs flying off.  And then as the rest of the people, the survivors leave in a panic, I want all our superstars 
[01:24:30]  armed with machine guns to mow down the crowd.  That'll get people talking.  And then whoever's left, I want them trampling each other like a who concert.  That's right.  Trample over each other.  Yeah.  People will remember that, Wrestlemania.  No chance in hell of anyone getting out alive. 
[01:25:00]  I want chains put on the doors.  I want all the doors locked.  And then I want Zyklon B pumped in.  Gas everybody.  That's right.  I'm a Nazi.  Vince McMahon's turned heel.  Major heel.  Huge heel.  I'm the new Hitler.  We're going to open up sprinkler heads on the roof of the, where was it? 
[01:25:30]  Citrus Bowl.  It's a Citrus Bowl.  Sorry.  Where was it?  It's your Wrestlemania.  I won.  I don't remember.  Because I'm thinking about pumping kerosene into the place and then lighten it on fire.  So everyone's on fire.  And I could yell over the PA, the last thing that I hear is, ironically, me saying,  You're fired.  You're on fire.  That's right.  Burn, people.  How many fat rooms do you think will show up for next year if I kill everyone this year? 
[01:26:00]  I'll tell you how many.  A hundred thousand.  You're on fire.  You're on fire.  There's a fireworks mishap.  And now look at you.  You're on fire.  That's right.  No butt puffing for you.  The skin will peel right off.  That's right.  Look at you.  No lips in that surprised expression. 
[01:26:30]  Because your face was on fire.  David from Ohio writes on the Instant Feedback,  What were you thinking sending the Angel of Death to Wrestlemania?  Here's a guy that's longer.  That's true.  Thank God no one died.  Iraq failed.  Iraq has seen a few people die in recent months.  He is like death.  Yeah.  He walks around.  He just needs that cloak and the sickle. 
[01:27:00]  Iraq, please say something that makes it worthwhile that you missed two days of work.  Well, when the explosion was going off, they were shooting from all sides of the stadium.  So I just thought it was part of the show.  I turned around where everyone was pointing,  and I got a photo just after they started putting the flames out.  Oh, okay.  That was worth missing two days of work, a flight to Florida, hotel rooms for the boys,  what to be VIP parties. 
[01:27:30]  This is what we get.  Iraq was still a little tipsy after those steak and mashed potato martinis that he was having.  Steak and mashed potato martinis.  What the hell is this?  Is this even real?  It's a martini glass.  And it's garlic butter saw?  It's full of mashed potatoes and bits of steak.  What the?  Look, there it is.  You ate one of those?  Holy Jesus.  He ate more than one?  I saw him taking at least two or three from the bar.  I had one.  And he didn't eat it.  He drank it.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Watch out, guys.  You know, after we fire Iraq, he's going to, like, have an outrageous article in Weight  Watchers magazine about us and how we treated him on this show.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Sam, how come you guys didn't mention this yesterday on the phone?  Yeah.  You forgot to mention this.  Oh, he did.  We did.  You did?  Yeah, he mentioned the steak and potato martini.  No, I'm talking about the fireworks.  Oh, I thought, well, this is much more tragic.  Fire, fire.  What is that?  Fire, fire, fire everywhere.  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire? 
[01:28:30]  Where's the fire?  Look at that.  Looks like entrails.  Oh, that is really disgusting.  You ate that?  What kind of non-friends are you to that you don't discuss the explosion until you've taken  your flight already?  What did you guys talk about after WrestleMania?  Would you stare straight ahead like two rape victims?  They didn't know it was a big deal until they saw the news reports.  Yeah, now they're trying to cover their ass.  Especially this one with the afro to my right.  What happened was, I think, obviously, E-Rock, again, was steak drunk.  And so he didn't even realize it happened.  Steak and potato martini. 
[01:29:00]  Ugh.  And I was still...  You disgust me.  Is this E-Rock's plate, by the way?  Please tell me.  Look at the chewed meat on the back end to the left.  What was that, some gristle?  No, it's going to be low-fat.  You spit it out.  You see how quickly E-Rock said, that's not me, which makes you look even worse, you dummy.  That means you eat the gristle, the fat, everything.  Eat the whole cow, do you?  How was it, though?  The steak in my mouth was delicious. 
[01:29:30]  Just meat and potatoes in a glass, in a martini glass.  You had a whole bar laid out for her, and you had your pick of what you wanted mixed into the martini.  It was great.  Were all the relatives there?  I mean, all the wrestlers there?  A handful of them were.  Yeah.  They were all getting ready for the event.  Yeah, the has-beens were there.  Oh, E-Rock, in an effort to get his photo signed by John Cena, who was there.  John Cena just stops in for a minute to, you know, he can't sit there and take pictures with everybody because it's chaotic.  So he's trying to leave, and a few people are asking for autographs. 
[01:30:00]  So E-Rock, first of all, brought a whole envelope full of at least 25 pictures that he's gotten taken with wrestlers, printed, and he brought it everywhere we went.  At this party we went to, John Cena's trying to leave, and this little kid is trying to get an autograph, who's with his mother.  So E-Rock grabs the kid and tells the mother, don't worry, I'll help him get a signature.  He picks the kid up in his arms and goes, hey, John, John, could you sign for him?  And so John turns around to sign for the little kid, and E-Rock just puts his picture with John Cena out, too, so E-Rock can get his John Cena autograph. 
[01:30:30]  You know what?  Hats off.  Jimmy likes that.  Jimmy likes that.  You used a kid.  Jimmy appreciates it.  Just get the job done, right, Jimmy?  Toss the young tot aside.  Please tell me he was a Make-A-Wish kid, and you dropped him.  On his head plate.  I respect that.  All right, there you go.  So you were sitting with a bunch of Make-A-Wish kids?  Yeah, it was like Make-A-Wish kids and radio people.  We're all in the same section.  Yeah, I figure. 
[01:31:00]  That's what Vince thinks of radio guys.  They were great seats, I will say that.  Sit them with the water heads.  I want them sitting with the soon-to-be-dead.  Vince is the best, man.  All right, well, there you go.  Our exclusive coverage of WrestleMania.  Of the tragic events that followed the end of WrestleMania.  Wow.  Just amazing.  I'm so glad our guys were there.  I would have mentioned it yesterday on the phone.  Yeah.  But I think in hindsight, I was still shaken from the whole... 
[01:31:30]  Let me spell this out.  The Hindenburg.  Yeah.  9-11.  Yeah.  WrestleMania 24.  Yeah.  Ranks right up there, right?  Yeah.  I mean, that's Hiroshima.  Hiroshima.  Yes.  Wow.  Okay.  But you think you might have still been a little shaken up the next morning, and that's probably  why it didn't...  It didn't even...  I'm still shaken up today.  I'm surprised we can have this conversation about it.  But yesterday, I was trying to avoid it and get back to real life and realize that 
[01:32:00]  I'm okay.  Might have blocked it out.  Yeah.  Some kind of weird survivor's guilt thing.  And who are you guys thrown under the bus?  Who insisted that you guys take two days off on the radio show?  I don't know, but I told Steve way in advance.  I feel like Steve could have mentioned it to a salesperson.  When did you tell Steve?  Probably at least a week before we left.  And what did he say?  He said okay, and then he sent an email out. 
[01:32:30]  One day.  One day.  Oh, here comes Steve.  Steve?  Oh, boy.  Sam said he was taking one day off, and that's when I said okay.  The two-day-off thing was during vacation.  Sam, comment?  Yeah, and vacation was like pretty much a week before we left for WrestleMania.  So that would be a week.  What magazine are you going to do your exclusive interview when you're finally let go from  this radio show?  Man-ass.  Yes.  Assless Chats Weekly.  I don't know why I bother even coming up to a microphone. 
[01:33:00]  Black Inches.  Yes.  I can't say the title on air.  Wait, Steve.  So you, you, you, did you read that a week before?  No.  No, it wasn't a week before.  I wasn't checking my email every day, first of all, and I just saw it in passing maybe  like a couple days before they left.  Why wouldn't you check your email every day?  Because I'm on vacation.  We're never really on vacation.  Yeah, I understand, but you know, it's sort of a...  I checked my email every single day when I was hanging out in the Caribbean. 
[01:33:30]  I checked, I didn't check my accent one, and I didn't.  So every attempt to heave me under the bus on this one...  I'm not talking to you.  No, no, not you.  Me?  Oh, no.  Sam?  No.  All right, Steve Delgado.  What?  We didn't mean to not have you back.  What?  Sorry, I'm just wrecking the show.  Go.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I know.  And in an attempt...  No one had my back for waxing.  That's right.  Exactly.  They had my back, but they wouldn't put their chin in it like I like. 
[01:34:00]  Exactly.  Why do I even bother?  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Do you know all chaps are assless?  I do.  That's what makes them chaps.  What?  Why do you say assless chaps, and they're also crotchless?  That's what makes them chaps.  They'd just be pants with ruffles.  Thank you for pointing out...  Which I also owned.  The redundancy.  Thank you, Steve.  It's very femme.  Before...  Before we go to break, I think this is a quickie. 
[01:34:30]  We did not forget, for the people that linger longer, we have this.  And now it's time for a mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Too long to explain now, but we're obsessed with mastic.  We did learn you could buy a house for how much again?  Oh, my God.  A mere couple thousand dollars or...  900 bucks.  Yeah, less than a thousand dollars, right?  Yeah.  A man jumped from a jeep during police chase and leaves kids, adults, inside. 
[01:35:00]  All in the lovely town of Mastic Beach, Long Island.  Authorities say they've arrested a Long Island driver who jumped from his jeep to escape a police chase,  leaving two children and two adults in the moving vehicle.  Bravo.  The Suffolk County Police Department says officers arrested the 41-year-old driver early Saturday  after he led them on a high-speed chase in Mastic Beach.  Police say the driver slowed down and leaped from the jeep, which was carrying his girlfriend, 
[01:35:30]  a 6-year-old, a 12-year-old, and a second man.  The male passenger managed to get behind the wheel and stop the vehicle before anyone was injured.  Tuck and roll.  Police say they chased the driver on foot and arrested him on charges of driving while intoxicated,  resisting arrest, and endangering the welfare of a child.  There you go.  All in Mastic.  And that was a bird's-eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A Mastic Moment on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:36:00]  Wonderful town.  It's been way too long.  We haven't had a Mastic Moment in quite a while there, Ant.  All right, we got Mark Maron coming in next.  Very, very funny comic.  Yes, very funny guy.  I love this guy, actually.  He's just bitter.  He's funny.  He's caustic.  Caustic.  He's self-destructive.  He's bespectacled.  He's bespectacled.  Yeah, he's got a little of that going on as well.  I just heard a replay with him when we were off.  Funny stuff, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, last time he was in.  It was great.  All right, we'll have him join the program next. 
[01:36:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  I want to say good morning to Buffalo.  We've kind of left Buffalo alone.  I don't know why.  We love Buffalo.  We might have some good news for Buffalo in the next month or so.  I like Buffalo.  Skipping formats?  Nah.  We'll be leaving your airwaves.  That's the good news we have for Buffalo.  Nah, I think we might bring the comedy tour up there this year. 
[01:37:00]  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  We're going to do a few dates this summer, right?  Yeah.  We're not going to get crazy with it like we did last summer, but we're going to do two or three, I think.  And we're thinking Buffalo.  Hello.  Mark Maron getting ready to sit down and join the program here.  But Jimmy had something about E-Rock.  Going back to the last break.  Just the last story he told me about WrestleMania at the end where him and Sam were at the dinner getting photographs or something with some of the wrestlers.  Yeah.  What happened?  It was a dinner where they weren't really doing any interviews, and we were waiting online to get a photo with one of the divas. 
[01:37:30]  And Sam was next to go up, and as he was going up, some other guy just cut in front of him with a little recorder and started doing an interview with this lady.  So Sam and I were kind of disgusted by it.  Finally, we get to her.  We get our photos.  They have professional photographers taking everything.  At the end of the night, they have your photos laid out on all these tables so you can pick up your photos with the celebrities.  So we found the photos of that guy with the wrestlers, and we took them all and threw them out. 
[01:38:00]  Not only with the wrestlers, E-Rock had in his hotel room a picture of this guy and this guy's wife from the show.  He just took all the pictures.  Wow.  Good for you.  What a douche.  Don't be confused.  E-Rock could be a dick just like anyone else on this radio show.  Good for you.  Good for you is right.  Props to you and Sam.  Hey, Mark Maron in the studio, fresh off his appearance on Conan O'Brien, which I heard was great.  You know, we go to bed at like 9 o'clock, so I didn't get to see it. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, it was a good one.  You know, I didn't leave thinking like, I've got to quit.  You know what I mean?  That's always a good thing when you do anything and you leave like saying, I know how to do this, thank Christ.  But that worked out all right.  I was on with Bob Costas, and it was one of those opportunities.  He stayed, and they don't always stay.  So there's that moment, you get that weird moment where you're like, you know, I don't know that guy because, like, you guys have Jose Canseco on today, right?  Yeah.  Well, they asked me, they're like, Opie and Anthony have Jose Canseco on, do you want to stay in the studio?  And I'm like, I don't know anything about sports, dude.  You're asking the wrong guy. 
[01:39:00]  Maybe they should kick me out.  I'll just be buzzkill.  You know, I didn't know.  Well, you should stay for our Jose Canseco interview.  Well, I'm going to stay, but I told that to Costas.  Like, I don't have nothing to talk about with that guy, with Costas, right?  So I said, I'm doing this show tomorrow, and Jose Canseco is going to be on with me.  And then I had to go, is that good?  You know, like, you know, and then I realized that I don't know nothing about sports.  So the conversation was over.  I'm sitting there with Costas like an ass, and I can't talk to him.  He's actually a good commentator on other stuff, too.  Like, he's a pretty across-the-board good commentator.  You really don't know anything about sports? 
[01:39:30]  Well, look, I'm not a baseball fan.  Well, what happened?  If you want to honestly know, you know, I'm an athletic person.  Oh, we don't.  Look at us.  Look at you.  You look great.  Thank you, man.  Do you want?  All right.  We're athletic specimens.  Look at us.  Well, the thing with me, when the competition, I don't think I was ever, you know, sort of  properly guided that way.  When I'm competing, if I'm losing, I want to break the game and leave.  That's just the way I am.  So, you know, and when I was in Little League, I was fat. 
[01:40:00]  So, I was always, they put me in center field because no one could hit it that far.  So, you know, there was just me and fat guys in center field.  And there was, well, here's why I'm not in sports.  And this is true.  You know why I laugh?  Because I know a little bit about Little League.  Like, it sounds impressive to be in center field.  But actually, I think it's like the second baseman or the shortstop is actually playing  center field.  Right.  He's talking about center field like where the majors hit it.  That's where you do put the slow kids.  Because the center field where, like, 12-year-olds get hit to is well covered by, like, the second 
[01:40:30]  baseman.  Right.  And this is Pee Wee.  So, it's just me and fat guys.  Fat guy in right field.  And you're just sitting there kicking the dirt around, waiting for something to happen.  And this is a true story.  I mean, I've told it before, but I was in center field, I hear a crack of a ball, and  it's coming to me, and I'm backing up, and I back up, and I fall down, the ball bounces  off my fat face, breaks my nose, because I fell down on a sprinkler or something.  And that was just it for me.  That was it.  You know, I got up there, the coach was like, get up, you're fat! 
[01:41:00]  And it was awkward.  It was humiliating.  Yeah, exactly.  So, that was it.  You just weren't cut out for it.  I wasn't cut out for it.  You know, Mark, one of Ken Seiko's most famous moments is a fly ball he lost in the lights,  which bounced off his head and went over the fence for a home run.  So, he'll relate to that.  So, maybe I should have stuck with it, and I wouldn't be, you know, playing San Antonio  for four people in a room that seats 400.  Maybe I made the wrong call there.  Have you been to San Antonio to that thing?  I have not, no.  Hold on, I've got to back up for a second.  The Ken Seiko thing you were just talking about? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  This is pretty amazing.  These guys are working today.  Danny ran it in.  High fly ball, right field deep.  Ken Seiko back to the track.  Look it up.  He's hunked his head.  It looked like.  And over the top.  A home run.  It looked like it hit Seiko in the top of the head.  We'll have to check the replay.  It did.  He went over the fence.  David Hull's laughing out there, so it must have been something funny.  It hit Seiko in the head and bounced over the wall for a homer. 
[01:42:00]  Look at this.  Boink.  And it's out of here.  Shouldn't this have been the first sign that he was on steroids, that he could take one  off the head and continue playing?  I don't think they took him out of the game.  It would have been more than an indication if he could catch it with his head.  Right.  A little hand just came out.  Yeah, he did so many steroids, he was starting to sprout little hands through his skull.  Santorelli once said to me, I work with Santorelli on television, and I told him I didn't watch  sports.  He literally, you know people who love sports. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he literally looked at me like I had just said that.  I don't even know what.  He looked at me with shock and horror.  He says, then how do you feel alive?  Wow.  In complete honesty.  Yeah.  Like, look, you know, I can play mind games.  You know, I'm really good at who cries first.  I played that with my wife a lot.  Some people are so into sports, it's their whole life.  Yeah, and I understand that.  You've got to believe in something.  I don't have anything against those people.  I just have nothing to talk to them about.  Because when I watch sports, I'm like a girl. 
[01:43:00]  Literally, if I'm in a room full of guys watching sports and they have loyalties to teams,  I'm the guy going, yeah, you hit it.  You hit it.  So San Antonio, because I think you were talking about being in a room with four people.  There's nothing worse as a comic than when you see the waitresses sitting in the back  and, you know, after the first show, they're going to be cut.  And they always try to make you feel better.  Like, yeah, there's some stuff going on in town.  And, you know, it's just you.  Oh, boy.  They had a comedy condo there, dude, that I was like, I mean, you're above this now  because, you know, you're, you know, whatever. 
[01:43:30]  But I've heard of these comedy condos.  I got to just jump in.  Yeah.  The club owners, they get one awful condo and they make the comedian stay there.  But usually, man.  And the place is usually just an S-hole because they don't really keep it up after a while.  They had good intentions at first.  It was probably nice and brand new.  But years later, it's just disgusting.  Yeah, this is 15 years into this club.  Man, like Al Magical, he's this comic guy.  I know he's funny.  And I told him I was going to San Antonio.  He goes, dude, you better bring shower sandals in a sweeping bag. 
[01:44:00]  And I'm like, no, come on.  How bad could it be?  I get there and I'm like, oh, man.  I should have brought shower sandals in a sweeping bag.  Why was the business just gross?  Well, it was like they had the same linens.  They had carpets.  They had, you know, vinyl upholstered furniture.  And this is 15 years into a comedy condo, which they may clean once a week.  But how much effort are they really putting into that?  And you're dealing with comics.  Who the hell knows what went on in there?  So, like, for 15 years of a film just over everything.  You kind of don't want to walk on stuff.  You get into the bed and you're like, oh, God.  I should have worn a coat or something. 
[01:44:30]  Why did you just get a hotel?  You're way more known than to do that.  You don't need to do that.  Why didn't you just say?  Because I saw it as some sort of, I saw it as a lesson, Jim.  I saw that I was, you know, I had become a biblical character.  And I would be putting through some sort of process.  Some sort of learning through humility process.  I'm right at the precipice, man.  Do you understand?  Did it help?  Huh?  Did it help?  I wanted to kill myself for three days.  Yeah, there's a certain amount of wisdom you get from that where you're just sitting there  looking out a window at an empty street in San Antonio.  You know, there's a crackhead there. 
[01:45:00]  Like, I went to the Alamo.  I didn't see that.  Whatever, man.  So you're just sitting there going, I understood what Oswald was thinking, you know, in a window  in Texas.  But I'm thinking about assassinating me.  Yeah.  And I'm just sitting there.  And there's moments when you come through the other side of that where you're like,  I can do this.  Everything's cool.  And then you go perform for 10 people in a room of 400.  And you're being too nice as we back up again.  Anthony from Long Island writes, Oop, Mark absolutely murdered last night on Conan.  Costas sucked.  And Mark Maron saved the whole show.  So, yeah, thank God.  And you're going to be at what?  Gotham Comedy Club this weekend? 
[01:45:30]  No, I'm going to be.  That's what they told me.  No, I've got to leave.  I've got to leave tomorrow.  I'm going to Seattle.  I'm going to tape my third and possibly last CD in Seattle.  People are asking me, why are you last?  And I'm like, I don't know what's going to happen.  And you pick Seattle.  That's where Kurt Cobain did his thing.  Are you going to do your thing after you?  No, I'm not going to do that.  I'm just being a self-pitying puss.  How's your single life doing?  I don't know, man.  I, you know, I'm just learning, like, well, I'm in the middle of this, I'm in the middle  of this divorce process now. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, you have fun with that.  What is wrong with that?  You enjoy that.  No, man.  I just, I don't under, you see, I don't want to bring us down here, man.  You know, we've got a sports guy coming in later.  No, bring us down because a lot of people can understand what you're going through.  He's divorced too.  And, you know.  Well, here's a couple of things that I didn't, but yeah, we talked about it the last time.  When I was here last time, I think I was still holding on to hope.  Oh, no.  I wasn't?  Hope goes out the window.  You are.  You are, and it was sad for me to see. 
[01:46:30]  Because I was, I was, because I remember I was watching what I said.  Yeah.  I was trying to be careful about things because I, but now.  Because you're thinking it might work out after all.  You're past that now, though.  Well, I mean, it's just, you start to have all these realizations and now, like, so much  has happened since the last time I'm here.  But the bottom, the bottom line is, is that I don't understand.  I don't want to generalize, you know, like, I'm not a misogynistic person.  I don't, I don't hate women.  I hate, like, two.  I know, and it's for good reason.  And, but I, I just don't understand what the hell she's doing. 
[01:47:00]  How vindictive they get.  I just, I mean, this is a person you know.  Oh, boy.  What?  Wait, I got nothing.  You know, and she gets, she, here's what happens.  I get a lawyer.  I get a lawyer that I pay, what, a few grand for, because I don't know how to file for  a divorce.  Who the hell knows how to do that?  Right.  You know, what are you supposed to, what, do you go online and get paperwork?  I don't know how to do that.  This is carbon copy.  Yeah.  Okay, so I go get a reasonable lawyer, just some scrapper out in Tarzana.  Yeah.  Some friend of a friend, this woman's just like, you know, I'll fight it out for you,  Mike, and I'm thinking, like, this is going to be good. 
[01:47:30]  It's going to be like a miniseries kind of thing.  Sure.  This woman can do it.  So I get a nice and cheap lawyer, just so I can file, because I just wanted to do that so I could  have sex with other people without asking her.  So then what happens is, of course, I have sex with the wrong person, because she knows  her.  And I don't know if it was on purpose.  I like to pride myself on thinking I'm not being an angry guy.  But, you know, I did take some action.  I was playing chess on some level.  Yeah.  That aggravated her.  So what happens is she leaves me.  Three months later, I file for divorce, right? 
[01:48:00]  I go to Scotland.  I come back.  You know, I date somebody she knows.  And now, all of a sudden, I'm the idiot.  I'm the idiot.  Like, her leaving has nothing to do with anything anymore.  Sure.  That's got nothing.  But why would you date her sister?  Well, I tried to date her mom, but I mean, you know, it's like...  Was it a friend of hers, or just someone she knew casually?  I would say casually, but, you know, we're in comedy.  You run in the same circles.  What am I supposed to do?  Go to another country?  Right.  You know, what are you supposed to do?  The community is what it is.  You know what you know. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  It's either going to be, you know, people in the rooms or going to be people in comedy.  That's it.  So now what happens is you pissed her off.  Yeah, I really did piss her off.  But the thing was, is like, okay, to me, I was rationalizing.  Like, how unusual is that?  You know what I mean?  That's what people do.  You know, when you get left, you can't hurt them.  So you got to go out and have sex with people they know.  Sure.  Didn't you do that?  Apparently, yeah.  I don't know if that was the reason.  Because the other side of it is you're lonely. 
[01:49:00]  You're broken.  Why am I the predator?  How come I'm not the victim in that situation?  This woman would not leave me alone.  Right.  Which is the truth.  All right.  Nonetheless.  I can't believe that.  All right.  So she goes out.  So now she gets a lawyer, right?  Just like you did, right?  Through the person, cheap, inexpensive.  No.  No.  She went and got the supreme divorce lawyer.  Right.  That's celebrities use.  Right.  Of course.  Numero uno.  Thank you. 
[01:49:30]  Thank you.  Because she is surrounded by vindictive.  Right.  Right.  They get a bug in their ear.  That's right.  And they go, yeah, I should.  That's right.  Ugh.  But the thing that I don't understand, bottom line, it's like, you got a lot more bread than  I do, bro.  And that's fine.  I'm proud of you.  Let me tell you something.  What?  I didn't at the time.  No?  No.  They waited and strung that divorce out until I signed a really good contract.  They waited.  I wasn't making a lot of money when we filed. 
[01:50:00]  But if you signed a contract after you filed for divorce, I mean, it's a lot of future earnings.  Potential.  I had the potential of making $85 billion.  I think the...  Oh, and she deserves, you know, a portion of that.  They figured out a way to make it so, like, it doesn't matter what you have.  It doesn't matter what your pay is.  Potential.  It matters.  You have the potential to make this much.  So you owe this much half of your potential of what you could make. 
[01:50:30]  So I'm sitting there looking at this number going, I can't come close to ever making that  in my life.  They had a figure over $100 million, I do believe.  They freaked, yeah.  Over $100 million.  And you were like $110 million.  Yeah.  You made a little more.  What the hell is that based on?  Nothing!  But how were they able to actually...  So what happened with that?  So they just strung that along?  They couldn't make a case based on that?  They strung it along and strung it along like they do because they want you to settle.  They don't want you to go through this.  They want you to settle and they want to get a good deal.  That's how divorces work. 
[01:51:00]  They rarely go to trial and rarely finish in court.  Usually both parties are so exhausted and punched out.  It's usually the guy that you turn around and go, look, I want to end this.  What do you need?  What do you want?  What do you want to do to just get out of my life?  And then you settle.  This is not a hopeful conversation.  No, it's not.  Because, you know, I mean, I'm trying...  For the most part, I'm a little morally bankrupt, but I'm a decent guy when it comes to business.  I'm a decent guy when it comes to loyalty to people, to friends. 
[01:51:30]  You know, I only have two friends or three.  So, you know what I mean?  I'm not going to screw them over.  She was one of them.  But now, I just don't...  What bothers me is that in my head, this person that's doing this, given that she made her  own money, given that, you know, the reason she left was like, I got a bag of cash.  You know, I got my own bread.  I'm taking off.  And it was like, it hurt my feelings, but I was willing to give her what was legally hers.  And then this other thing happens, and I'm like, how do you live with yourself?  How do you...  How do you live with yourself? 
[01:52:00]  With your money.  But it ain't that much money.  Don't matter.  My money, whatever that's going to be, it ain't going to last her long.  And the truth of the matter is, is that, are you telling me that women in general are  that able to justify and morally compromise themselves, to just say, you know, screw...  They don't have no conscience?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  She's looking for a lot?  I mean, that was like a big piece of whatever...  She's looking to just turn the screws.  Well, no, what the deal is, is that, you know, I got what I have.  You know, I made some...  I saved some money, because I had the radio gig for a little while. 
[01:52:30]  All right?  But now, you know, what have I got?  I'm doing stand-up.  You know, last year, I got a little deal with HBO.  I just finished a second draft of a script for HBO, but we had the writer's strike.  That, you know, took me out of the game for months.  And then, you know, who the hell knows what's going to happen with that?  It's not a lot of bread.  So this last year wasn't that great.  So she wants half...  You know, I don't mind giving her half what's legally hers.  But the truth of the matter is, there's some stuff that's not.  And she's vindictive about it.  She's like, you know, I deserve everything.  I'm like, dude, you got...  You know, you made some bread.  You know, take half of this.  And this is all based on the fact that you dated one of her friends, you think? 
[01:53:00]  No, I think...  I don't know what it's based on.  The fact was is that she left, and for three months, she said, I don't know what I want  to do.  And then I said, well, what are we going to do with that?  And she says, I still don't know.  I said, look, I'm going to file for divorce because it's not fair.  And that's that.  I mean, the other stuff, dating.  I don't know what the hell you're supposed to do.  Aren't you supposed to date?  I mean, what are you supposed to do?  Hell yeah.  I mean, it's like, I'm just a dude here.  You know, maybe I made some wrong decisions.  I don't know how to date.  I never dated before.  The guy just gets so screwed in these divorces.  I mean, this is an ongoing theme on our show. 
[01:53:30]  And you got to pay the legal fees of the woman who gets the best lawyer around, and you get  like a piece of crap lawyer, and then you have to pay for her good lawyer to screw you  over.  And then you sit there, and you wind up selling.  You have all these...  Let me tell you something.  You'll go through this, too.  You'll have all these delusions that court and divorce court is this thing that's based  on your individuality, you're you, she's her, things will come out that'll prove that 
[01:54:00]  you are this guy that did this, and she did this, and you deserve what you have, and she  doesn't deserve this.  And then you realize, oh my God, I'm just this docket number, and it's cookie cutter.  They're like, they look at you as John Doe and Jane Doe, and they'll look at a slide  rule and crunch some numbers, and they have a formula that they go through. 
[01:54:30]  There's no friend that'll barge through the door and go, your honor, I've known this man  for years.  And let me tell you.  And then the judge goes, that's fantastic.  Dismissed!  You, missy, leave this courtroom, you hussy.  I was hoping you'd do that for me.  It does, I will, it won't help, but it really just comes down to a formula?  It comes down to this formula to get you in and out the door quickly and get the next  case in.  There's no individuality in these cases. 
[01:55:00]  I'm starting to feel that, and you know, oddly, you know, what you're doing for me  now, which maybe I needed to be done, is you're completely diminishing my hope.  And maybe that's why...  Yeah, get rid of the hope.  Get rid of it.  Is this window open?  Uh, no.  That's why, thank God.  Mark, let me tell you something.  It almost destroyed Anthony.  The stress I saw in this guy's face.  Oh!  Because it just went on and on and on.  Well, that's what happens.  You can't live your life.  And Anthony's a good guy.  He was really trying to do the right thing when he was going through this divorce.  I know Anthony can't really talk about things, but I saw things where he was really trying 
[01:55:30]  to make sure she was okay and they were going to move on and stuff, and that wasn't  good enough for her.  Well, that's what happened.  And she went for the jugular, my friend.  Yeah, I just don't, like, I don't know, I assume that she's on top of all this, and  I guess maybe, am I being an idiot?  Did we tell you the bank account?  Did we tell you the bank account story?  Am I being an idiot for talking about it?  No, not at all.  We love this.  We love this subject.  You don't get into, like, details, really, and stuff.  You don't get into, like, details of property and stuff like that.  That could get you in a little bit of a jam up. 
[01:56:00]  But you can talk about your life, especially if you're on the air.  You're a comedian, also.  So, I mean, your job is talking about your life and things like that, so.  Well, I mean, it's just like, after a certain point, like, because I just don't understand  it, that there's a reasonable thing that needs to happen here, and you can't be reasonable  anymore.  No, no, no.  Reasonable goes out the window.  And this is when Anthony realized it.  I'll try to keep it vague, but Anthony's going through this.  And I looked at Anthony one day.  We're in our office a few hours before the show, and I go, you got a joint bank account? 
[01:56:30]  And Ant goes, yeah.  I go, you might want to, you know, go check on that.  And Ant, I swear to you, goes, I'm going to go, and I'm going to take half the money  out.  The marriage is definitely done at this point.  Definitely.  There's no turning back.  And Ant, as a good guy, goes, I'm going to take out half, which is mine, and I'll leave  the other half for her, even though probably you were more than half was officially yours,  let's be honest.  So he had way less than 100 G's in the bank, and this is after doing radio for four or  five years, okay?  Yeah.  And we go down, I remember like it was yesterday, it was lunchtime, we go down to the bank, 
[01:57:00]  and Anthony fills out his little withdrawal slip, hands it over to the teller, I'm taking  half, I want my money, and the...  She goes, let me get the manager.  Yeah.  And the manager of the bank comes over and goes, you have a balance of $5.52.  Not only did she take the entire joint account out, she left about four or five bucks just  to make it hurt that much.  Yeah.  Well, to not close the account.  Well, here's the thing that I did that maybe was a mistake, maybe you did it yourself, is 
[01:57:30]  that from the beginning, and this is true, from the beginning, I was honest, I was transparent,  I mean, you know, they asked for stuff, I organized it, I spent three weeks putting everything  I had together, because I just wanted this to go smoothly.  Right.  And I gave them everything.  Right.  You just want it to get over with, smoothly, civil, and fair.  And fair.  And it just isn't, you know, it's just not enough, and then you start to, it is, and 
[01:58:00]  because it goes on for so damn long, any amount of joy that you have in your life, you're like,  hey, you know, today's okay, man, I'm having a sandwich.  No.  I'm outside, and then all of a sudden it's like, oh, it takes one email from either.  This Paul is just over you.  Yeah, it never goes away.  And I have one of those over me anyway.  It's a vague one that has no definition.  Oh, you poor bastard.  I am, I'm living with a Paul upon a Paul.  Yes.  I feel like I'm.  I have several Pauls over me right now.  Oh, God.  I feel like I went into a time machine.  I know.  I'm looking at Anthony.  I know.  You've got a lot to learn, my friend. 
[01:58:30]  The first thing, and it is horrid.  We walked away from the bank, I had to give Anthony money so he could live for a couple  days.  I was like, I just need a couple of bucks till payday.  She wiped them out.  Need a couple of bucks till payday there.  She wiped them out.  The hope thing really does have to just leave.  You've got to leave any hope.  It's a shifting hope.  Before, I hope that we could still be together, but now you just hope that it doesn't get  as ugly.  No, you will go through times where you are so mad. 
[01:59:00]  You are so infuriated at the ex, at the ex's lawyer, at your lawyer.  Just pure, utter rage because you can't convey what you want, how you want this to go through.  You want to open your mouth in the court, but you can't.  You're not allowed.  Your lawyer talks for you.  It just seems to be, to me, you know what it comes right down to, and I don't know if  it's because I'm a Jew or what.  It's just like, we're wasting money.  Yeah.  Of course.  I mean, what are you doing? 
[01:59:30]  I mean, this is ridiculous.  Such a waste.  You're wasting money.  I'm wasting money.  I mean, this is no time for that crap.  That's why, in the long run, you will settle.  I guarantee this will not get to an end, to a trial, to a judge making a judgment.  You will settle.  Because it's a wearing down process.  Also, it's not in the lawyer's best interest to settle right away.  They want this to go on forever to build up their lawyer fee.  But the weird thing is, I got nothing.  I got nothing. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, you got enough, my friend.  I guess you got enough.  You got enough, obviously.  Yeah, you must have a little something.  It's about female greed and entitlement.  That's what becomes, they want to be equals, and they are tired of being second-class citizens  until it comes to divorce or child custody, and they're very happy to be second-class.  They're back on the prairie.  They want their independence, so you've got to finance that.  Right.  Right.  Thank you.  You do.  You have to finance their independence.  Now, what happens now with you and her?  Me and the ex?  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  The ex-wife?  Uh, I still make payments, which, um...  You have a kid?  No.  No kids, no house?  No kid, no nothing.  Let me tell you something.  I went into this divorce with my paycheck, what I made on a weekly basis working at WNEW down  the road, and it wasn't this ridiculous amount of money, and we didn't own anything.  I leased a car.  That was pretty much it.  You leased a car, and you guys had way less than 100 Gs in the bank, and she took that. 
[02:01:00]  That should have been the end of story.  What's the law here?  It went on and on and on, and for years, it went on with delays and postponements, and  it...  Mark, he's still paying, okay?  To the point where I'm sitting there going, like, I can't do this anymore.  Right.  This has to end.  You know what I'm finding, though?  On a spiritual level.  Mm-hmm.  On a spiritual level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You believe in the devil.  Is that... 
[02:01:30]  Well, I always believed in the devil.  Yeah.  I just didn't know I was working for him for years.  But on a spiritual level, you know, sometimes you know who your employer is, but on a spiritual  level, I've been really learning that, you know, the things that make me happy are very  simple and don't cost any money.  Right.  The simple things in life.  Hey, with that, we've got to take a break.  We've got Mark Maron in the studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for saving me my job, Jimmy.  Oh.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got Mark Maron in the studio.  He's flying out to Seattle. 
[02:02:00]  He's playing...  Giggles.  Giggles.  Okay.  I'm taping a CD, and I'm honest with you, I'm not that prepared, but I'm angry, and I'm  at the end of my rope.  So I think I'm just looking for a CD that can never happen again.  Right.  That's the one I want this time.  This is the perfect time for this.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  I think it's going to be a masterpiece.  I hope so.  I'm going to do the big crying closer, which you don't see as much as you used to.  That's the crying closer.  Nice. 
[02:02:30]  We're having fun today.  Hey, little known fact.  It was 10 years ago today that we did our mayor's prank up there in Boston.  Got us thrown out of Massachusetts.  Boy, did it get us thrown out of Boston.  And this is the first April Fool's we've worked since then.  Companies and bosses have been very nervous to put us on the air over the years, ever  since that big prank we did in Boston.  What was that?  I'm sorry.  I was probably sleeping.  Well, they were a little nervous of us even talking about it today, but basically we told  all of Boston that the mayor died in a car accident.  It was the younger version of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:03:00]  Today's that day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  April Fool's.  April Fool's.  Happy birthday, Craig.  It's my brother's birthday.  Oh.  I better call him.  Thank God you reminded me.  So, speaking of that, I bring it to everyone's attention because stupid W-E-E-I, Dennis and  Callahan, taking a little shot at us today, Ant.  This just went down a little while ago.  So we're out of time.  We can't do our top 10 April Fool's jokes of all time?  The mayor's dead.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  No, the mayor's alive, kicking.  He's happy, healthy, out riding his bike every morning at 5 a.m. 
[02:03:30]  I'm not going to give you 10.  I'm going to give you like three or four out of the top 10 April Fool's hoaxes of all time.  Whatever happened to those idiots that said the mayor was dead, they were like working  at that McDonald's with the child molester.  What did they say?  Really?  See more?  Excuse me, douche.  We're in the number one market on FM radio.  We're syndicated to major cities and we're on XM satellite radio.  So we're heard all over Canada and America.  And where is this ass heard that I've never heard of his name?  More dishonesty from radio guys. 
[02:04:00]  Denison Callahan and WEEI.  I guess they want to know where Opie and Anthony are, guys.  Well, hey fans.  Hey!  Hey, everyone listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Call their stupid worthless show and tell them where we are, what we're doing, and throw  in the C word while you're at it.  And who cares?  Which C word?  And mail C pictures.  Mail C pictures and the C word.  Yes, and mail them pictures of men's genitals because they look to me like the type of gentleman 
[02:04:30]  that would probably enjoy that.  And they're a Denison Callahan in Boston.  We're up against them in Boston.  Are we?  Really?  Up against them?  I don't think so.  These guys are defending a corner.  You're defending the country.  That's right.  Where are they?  At McDonald's?  Are you stupid, out of touch jackass?  Look, just stay in your own little market.  Just stay there.  Carve out your little niche and ignore everything else that's happening in the business you're  in.  But they know. 
[02:05:00]  They're lying.  They do know.  It's dishonesty.  Radio guys are filled with dishonesty.  Get that douche on the phone.  Not only do they know a lot about us, they know about our entire careers.  We're on in Boston.  And they know that.  They might even know that they're going to get a lot of attention today.  This means war.  See, people are under this misconception that getting attention from us is good.  It's the worst thing possible.  Our fans are despicable bastards. 
[02:05:30]  Right, Maxwell?  You enjoyed the attention, didn't you, Maxwell?  Maxwell, who's kept his mouth shut recently because the pests have done nothing but just  slam him relentless.  They're still pounding him that he can't do his own show because our pests just tie up  his phone lines.  Whatever happens to those.  What do we got?  Another.  Look at this curmudgeon douche.  I love whatever happens to those idiots.  I don't know.  We rode the publicity right into New York City radio. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And into syndication.  You know, it's weird, too, because people don't realize that radio is not his own world,  man.  Hold on, Mark.  Yeah.  Jimmy is taking a look at good old John Dennis.  Oh, what a fool.  Now, we openly admit we're not lookers for the most part, but wow, look at this guy.  Just what a...  Wow, look at this guy.  He's wearing a sweater vest.  What a fruit.  Yeah, he's got no choice but to do regional radio.  John Dennis, this is his bio.  The blizzard of 78 was a year away, and John Havlicek was still playing basketball for 
[02:06:30]  the Celtics when John Dennis embarked on the Boston portion of his broadcasting career.  So he started before Boston in the 70s, and no one still knows who you are.  Yeah.  You're still...  You're fledgling nobody.  And you're a nobody.  No one knows who you are.  And every...  30 years.  Every guy that's in radio wants to go to a bigger city, wants to be heard by more people,  wants to be syndicated, and it never happened for John Dennis.  Here comes Nick Carter.  Nick, how are you, sir?  You got a little something on Dennis and Callahan? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't even...  There's only 10 minutes of show left.  But in terms of John Dennis, he used to be a big-time TV sportscaster.  Really?  Oh.  I think Channel 7.  Okay.  Failed jock?  Is that what I'm being led to believe here?  Failed jock?  Well, all I know is now, like, he was like Mr. Squarejaw TV guy, but he just let himself  go.  He's like...  He looks like...  Yeah.  Stir-fried ass.  Well, let's...  Well, I think the Pests have a mission.  What's the numbers there, Jimmy?  You got something?  Yeah.  It's W-E-E-I-A-M, which is obviously a big station. 
[02:07:30]  Amplitude modulation, my friends.  Whoa!  Nice.  888-525-0850.  888-525-0850.  And don't...  Make sure when you call that you're respectful.  Don't assault the call screener with the C-bomb.  Don't get on the air and drop F-bombs, because that will really hurt their show.  Yeah, that would be really, really bad.  Just let them know where the O.B. and Anthony show wound up.  Yeah, that would be really bad.  Don't make fun of the fact that he went to Kent State and just missed it by a couple 
[02:08:00]  of years, which should have happened to him.  You know, don't mention any of that stuff.  And once again, this is why.  I'm not going to give you ten.  I'm going to give you like three or four out of the top ten April Fool's hostess of all  time.  Whatever happened to those idiots that said the mayor was dead, they were gone.  They're like working at that McDonald's with the child molester.  Can you believe the dishonesty?  Working at that McDonald's with the child molester.  Working at that McDonald's.  Hey guys, WEI is asking where we went, so I think you really need to tell them where  we went.  Yeah, what's the number one more time, EROC?  888-525-0850.  And I want phone calls around the clock. 
[02:08:30]  Everybody suffers.  Everybody suffers.  Everybody.  Everyone, take them down.  Everyone suffers.  And don't give them a chance to say, oh well, a couple of people called.  Yeah.  Just instant barrage.  Shock and awe on the phones.  I was here when the war began.  I remember April 1st.  You're right here.  April 1st.  That war that lasted in radio for 19 years until that fellow in Boston dropped dead on  the air.  Started the day I was there. 
[02:09:00]  Mark, I hate to tell you, but this is one of many wars we're fighting.  Our troops are spread thin at this point.  You know, I don't know how the hell, it's like I wish I could listen to you, but I get  up, people always ask me, do you read that blog?  Do you listen to that show?  Do you go on YouTube?  It's like, dude, I am so old school, man.  I get up and I just sit there and it's all dread panic, revenge fantasies for me.  Masturbation.  I don't know how people find the time to get out of their own heads long enough to even  indulge themselves in entertainment. 
[02:09:30]  We got some more.  The intel is already coming in, which is wonderful, Anthony.  Brian in Boston listening on BCM.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys, if you want to call them, it's just pound W-E-E-I from  Verizon phone, too.  So you can go to that line, too.  Is it a free call if you do pound W-E-E-I?  Oh, yeah.  So Verizon phone users, pound W-E-E-I.  Oh, yeah.  Mark, you have no idea.  There are opium Anthony cells around the country.  You have.  They're all snapping into action. 
[02:10:00]  They're crawling out of bed, having their first nine cigarettes.  That's right.  Fixing their mullets.  Yeah.  These guys in radio with their dishonesty, it's just.  I went to.  I was in Tampa.  It's unbelievable.  I was in Tampa.  Yeah.  And I go to do a show, right?  And you know me.  I got to talk.  I get to the show, and the guy's like, yeah, we're going to put you on after the news for  three minutes.  And I said to the person who brought me, I'm like, let's get out of here.  What am I going to do in three minutes?  And then I hear the guy go, so what happened to Air America?  Yeah.  So there's a vindictive.  Yeah.  He's like, you're going to take a shot at me?  Then I started talking to him, and he's like, oh, I'll give you six. 
[02:10:30]  And we openly admitted, because it's the 10-year anniversary, we blew up our careers in Boston  because New York was calling.  We admitted that.  Yep.  You know, we knew exactly what we were doing.  We took meetings in New York before we got fired.  A month before we were fired, we were in WNEW meeting with the program director saying,  I don't know, we're under contract.  I would love to live here and work in New York, but we're under contract in Boston.  And I want to make it perfectly clear, the NAW people did nothing wrong. 
[02:11:00]  They're like, it's really too bad you're in contract, because we would hire you tomorrow.  And I'm like, well, I think we could.  Yeah.  I said Anthony, actually, in the train back to Long Island.  I'm like, yeah, I think we could fix that.  I think this could be fixed.  I think this could be fixed.  Believe me.  And we tried numerous things, and the mayor thing really worked like a charm.  So continue saying that it was a stupid prank, and we blew up our careers, and we're working  where?  At a convenience store or something?  McDonald's.  McDonald's.  We're at McDonald's.  We're now at McDonald's.  And when you take an action like that, where you sabotage your career for a better opportunity,  just from personal experience, make sure you have that offer lined up. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  You hear that, Rick?  You dope.  So W-E-E-I, what is it again, Jimmy?  We want phone calls around the clock.  But again, everyone suffers.  No profanity, because that's only going to wreck their show.  1-888-525-0850, because they probably don't have a lot of delay.  Yeah, I'm sure.  They don't have a nine-minute dump button like this idiotic show. 
[02:12:00]  No, no.  And let me tell you how dishonest these guys are.  There was a recent article in the Inside Track with the manatees.  We call them the manatees, these fat slobs that write the gossip column for the Boston  Herald.  And there was an article about, there's a rumor going around that those two were going  to be replacing us on BCN.  Right.  So they know exactly who we are.  And where we are.  They were in the same article as us.  I lived in Boston for eight years.  I was in Boston for a long time.  Yeah.  And BCN used to sponsor the comedy competition. 
[02:12:30]  Sure.  It started my career, actually.  Yeah.  Mark Parenteau was the guy.  And, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He tried to spray paint you black.  He caught you.  Yeah.  He did, actually.  Mark Parenteau.  I thought it was just improv.  Hey.  Hey.  Why don't you?  Hey.  I got a PlayStation for you, kid.  Come into my van.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark Maron's in studio.  Hey, Mark.  I dropped the cart.  Can you bend over and pick that up for me?  Oh, yeah.  That sounds exactly like him.  That's hilarious. 
[02:13:00]  Who was the guy in the morning then?  You bend over a little more, I'm going to tell everybody how funny you are, Mark.  Oh, yeah.  I'm getting the creeps now.  Who was doing more?  It feels like the beginning of my career.  Charles Lack would do it.  Charles Lack was blaming those glass cock.  We used to call him Charles Lack of Talent.  Remember?  Charles Lack of Talent.  Used to drive him nuts.  And then when we did the mayor's prank, he couldn't wait to get on TV and just completely destroy us.  But my favorite has always been Lon and Wally.  Right.  I listen to Lon and Wally on the way home every day. 
[02:13:30]  It's a wonderful program.  While I'm making right-hand turns because I can't make a left.  Can't.  I think you're longer.  That's my ex-mother-in-law.  Hey, this is a quickie, and I really want to do something about this today, but we ran out of show.  Jimmy was talking yesterday how he's convinced eventually cigarettes will be banned.  Right, Jimmy?  I think eventually they will find a way, yes.  Well, there's an article.  In the future?  There's an article in the Daily News, and I think we're years away from that, Jimmy. 
[02:14:00]  Cigarettes are going up again.  No throwing cigarette butts out of your flying cars.  I quit smoking cigarettes.  How much do you think a pack of cigarettes is going to be going up to?  $80,000.  $10.  Pretty close.  $9 a pack, my friends.  That's why cigarettes are not going away anytime soon.  Let's float the economy on the back of the weak and addicted.  They have no health care.  They're going to die anyways.  They're grist for the mill.  Wow.  You should be a politician.  People are begging that we attack the big show that's on WEEA2. 
[02:14:30]  We're talking around the clock, people.  Across the board.  Because they said whatever happened to those guys.  So we're going to make it perfectly clear what happened to us.  Let them know.  Hey, so listen to this, though.  Cigarettes are going to go up to just under $9.  Now, the wholesale average is $2.28.  Listen to all the taxes they got on this damn thing.  Nick Redd, very good.  Federal cigarette tax, that'll cost you $0.39 per pack, okay?  Then you got the average retailer markup.  They mark it up at $1.42 for you.  Then you got the new doubled state cigarette tax, which will be $3 a pack. 
[02:15:00]  Then you got the state sales tax, which is $0.22.  And then finally, you got the city cigarette tax.  If you're buying cigarettes in New York City, that's another $1.50.  Right.  And then if you admit you smoke, you can't get health coverage, so there, that insurance  company saves a fortune.  So when you spent all your money on cigarettes and you're broke and your lungs are rotting,  all you got for coverage is God.  Good luck.  So that's why it's interesting you said that yesterday, Jimmy.  There's no way they're going to ban this anytime soon with the money it's bringing in.  They are getting a lot of tax money, but I'm telling you, the lobby behind anti-smoking 
[02:15:30]  is very strong.  You're still off, right?  Yeah, man.  I've been off since December of 2001.  I remember when you quit.  Yeah, man.  Esty at the Cellar helped me a lot.  She marched me over and got me on the patch immediately, and that saved me.  I'm chewing nicotine gum now because I get strung out on cigars.  I don't even like, I'm not a cigar guy, but man, to sit there for an hour and just get  a nice, steady stream of nicotine, but now you're not going to get my mouth rotted.  Whatever.  That scares me.  I go on and off.  They do?  Yeah, because I know I love the nicotine rush.  Oh, Christ.  I'm going to leave here afraid of cigars and afraid of women. 
[02:16:00]  All right, we got to wrap up.  Here's the deal.  A lot of people thought it was an April Fool's joke, but it really isn't.  Jose Canseco's running late.  We got to talk to him on the other side of the show today.  Yes.  Sorry for the people that don't have the XM.  I don't know what to tell you.  It's a missed flight.  It's a missed flight.  Well, actually, but then he did Letterman last night, so maybe he was celebrating that  last night.  But that's exactly what it was.  It was a missed flight that pushed all this press and backed everything up.  That's why.  And then we got Marc Maron.  He's going to be at Giggles in Seattle this weekend, taping his last CD before he offs himself.  So that's...  Wow. 
[02:16:30]  That's going to be a collector's item though, Marc.  You're going to live on.  Just like my book is.  You can get it for $1.39 on Amazon.  Okay.  Marc's a great comic.  I love Marc, man.  I was scared of Marc when I first met him.  I used to see him at the Comedy Cellar a lot.  I'm like, wow, this guy really stands out.  And then I went and saw him at comics and man, what a...  Just a brilliant comic, really.  Thanks, man.  Really, really good stuff.  And I love Marc because him and Louis C.K. were the first two really established New  York guys to treat me nice.  And Colin.  And Colin.  Three first, yes.  Two out of three is not bad.  Giggles in New York City. 
[02:17:00]  No, Seattle this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  And once again, Denison Callahan of WEEI in Boston, doesn't matter if you're listening  in another city, they asked a question today, whatever happened to those what?  What was the quote?  Dopes?  Idiots?  Idiots.  Idiots.  Well, our fans are going to let them know exactly what happened to us.  We want phone calls around the clock.  888-525-0850.  Have fun with that one, manatees.  They'll be writing about that one.  All right, guys.  April Fool's.  See ya. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, by the way, the attack is not an April Fool's joke because, you know.  Yeah.  We do talk to a lot of dummies every day.  We really want you to do that.  Yeah.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  See ya.  Don't be an Anthony.  Infamous DJs.  Don't be an Anthony.  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio, patiently waiting for Jose Canseco to come through that  fine door of ours.  Of ours.  We got Marc Maron.  He made the walkover to continue bitching about women. 
[02:18:00]  Well, I'd like some advice, though.  He's going through a tough time.  I'm going to ask you guys for advice.  That's how bad off I am.  Hey, we are the purest, probably most honest people you can ask.  You scared the hell out of me.  You don't have an agenda or anything.  Yeah.  I thought I was feeling better this morning.  I'm like, I'm excited.  I'm going to go down there.  I talked to you for 10 minutes about divorce, and now I'm like, I'm done.  But I like how you were saying your hope is diminishing.  Because that is a good thing. 
[02:18:30]  You don't want hope.  I have no hope of us ever being friends or the marriage continuing.  Oh, yeah.  That should go out the window immediately.  But I had some hope that there would be some closure, resolution to this process.  It goes on and on for a while.  And the best advice I could give you is, no matter what, don't let it really take hold  and just dominate your life.  It happens in moments.  For three years for me, it was nothing but an all-consuming mess that I just couldn't. 
[02:19:00]  I'd wake up in the morning, boom, there it was.  Right, well, that's why some days are better than others, you know, it's almost like this  thing, like some sort of universal force that I have no control over.  Because you know she's just a person, and I know where she lives, I know where she hangs  out.  Yeah.  And there's part of you that thinks, like, I'm going to go appeal to her better side.  I'm going to go stalk her like a reasonable person, confront her in a coffee shop, and  demand that she show me her better side and cut this crap out. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, man, Mark.  The lawyer already gave her the speech that this might be coming.  You're kidding me.  Lawyers are just scum.  Well, I can tell when she's talking and her lawyer's talking.  Like, she said to me, wow, you know what, now I'm concerned about details, but it doesn't  really matter.  But there was this moment, look, you know, it's been, I'm a comedian.  You know, I'm in show business.  I'm not a doctor.  Some years are better than others.  And it just, the whole thing to me is just sad because I was honest, she left me, and 
[02:20:00]  now I'm the asshole.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, and it's just like.  At least you're finally, you got it right.  Right.  It's about time.  But there are those moments where, like, you want it, you just, it's the same moment when  they leave.  I mean, you know, I don't know how dramatic it was for you.  But, you know, I thought things were okay.  I thought things were, you know, I know I have an anger problem.  You know, I know that, you know, that it was difficult.  Yeah.  But I was trying.  But, you know, in its best moments, when you're in a relationship, you think you have  some semblance of control. 
[02:20:30]  You don't, you don't really, you know, entertain the idea that they just can take their vagina  and leave.  And then you.  Pick it up with them and go.  Right.  Yeah.  And then you're going to stand there going, wait, we're married.  Isn't half of that vagina mine?  Don't I have any say?  They, I think, have dibs on the whole vagina.  Right.  And you don't want a vagina that doesn't like you in the house.  No.  But the horrible thing is that there was, I don't even remember if I talked about this,  because I'm over this stuff, as you can tell.  I mean, I, you know, I'm past this stuff.  But now it's just, I did everything I was supposed to do.  I did it right in this party. 
[02:21:00]  It's like, I want to be rewarded for being honest in this process.  Oh, no.  You'll be punished.  You'll be punished severely for it.  Oh, my God.  I guess I'm being naive.  There's so much to learn.  I know.  But this is not the lesson I wanted to learn.  Divorce court is bizarro world.  It's just, everything's backwards.  The nicer you are, the worse you'll be treated.  It's just, it's a horrible thing to have to go through.  My first divorce, I had no money.  I just, you know, I gave her half of the, you know, the take from the book.  You just said, you just said first divorce?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You married again? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I can't even talk to you.  Have you, I loved her.  I loved her.  Didn't you?  You liked her.  I mean.  It doesn't matter if you love, there's no second marriages.  God, what, what, what, what love becomes, dude.  I mean, I, you know, because there was that period, man, where she was, she was still getting  the mail at my house, right?  She leaves me, but she's still getting her mail and then her shit still at the house.  And, and she would come over to get the mail, you know, and this is what I'm hanging on  to hope.  So, you know, you, you know, she's coming over to get the mail.  So you're, you know, you're combing your hair. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, you're brushing your teeth.  Yeah.  You're brushing your teeth.  You're putting your shoes on.  God, I want to slap you in your tongue like this.  You're holding your belly in and she comes over to get the mail.  Yeah.  And this is why, but this is a woman I was in love with, man.  I mean, I left a woman, I left a marriage for this woman and, and I loved her and I  would have done anything for her.  Right.  But here's what it becomes.  You know, she comes over for mail and then you start getting into this thing where she's  like leaving.  I'm like, so, you know, I mean, you want to, you know, you want to spark up a conversation. 
[02:22:30]  No, I want to fuck her.  Yeah.  Well, unfortunately she's picking up the mail and going home to another mail.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Kind of spelt a little different.  See, I don't even, I don't even want to believe that.  You don't want to think that.  You're not ready to believe that one yet?  I don't know that that's true.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, man, you guys.  How long you been, I know.  You really want to hang with us today, Mark?  But all I'm saying, all I'm saying is that.  We have a little experience with this.  We've been talking about this subject for, off and on for 10 years.  This is somebody that I was in love with and that I was, you know, head over heels.  And what it becomes is that she's picking up a mail and I'm saying, you know, come on. 
[02:23:00]  You know, here's the thing.  If you're a woman and, and, and I've asked women this in clubs and I said, how many times  have you, have you fucked the guy that you broke up with?  And you know, you get a good, good amount of people.  And I say, well, the, the ones that don't, you know, you, you are the worst type of woman.  I mean, do us a favor, you know, I mean, after you break up with us, I mean, just fuck  us occasionally.  Is that wrong?  Oh, uh, that's, um, that's not a good idea.  Well, here's the saddest part about it.  Is this the person you love and she's coming over to get her mail and it gets, it's sort of like 
[02:23:30]  just for old times.  I mean, I don't, you still feel it, whatever, you know, and it got to this point where,  you know, I just remember, you know, proposing to her, telling her how much I love her.  And then it gets to me where she's walking out with a bundle of mail, a bundle of mail.  And I'm saying, come on, just fuck me.  She's like, I don't think that'd be a good idea.  And I'm like, and this is what happened.  I'm like, can we just show me your ass and let me jerk off?  So that's, that's what, that's what love becomes.  She's like, you really want to do that?  And I'm like, yeah, can we just show me your ass and let me jerk off? 
[02:24:00]  That's a good one.  Did you do that?  Did you do the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life?  Yeah.  And she said no.  And I'm like, well, I'm still going to do it.  You know?  So it was, it was pathetic, but, but what it was, it is still going to jerk off to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't stop me.  Could you show me your ass while I jerk off?  How great is that?  That's great.  But the thing is, nothing wrong with that.  Comics are a special breed, aren't we?  Oh boy.  But that's, that's the weird thing is that that, that was the, as romantic as I could  be at that moment.  Right.  In that moment of desperation, all I had was that. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  Those were the option.  That's tough, bro.  I could have just said bye.  You know, I hope you didn't get any bad mail.  Yeah.  But no, I'm like, please just let me, let me jerk off to your ass.  Oh, wow.  And that does show women though, when you like, when you, when it was all boiled down, that  is what they are.  And then, please just let me look at your hiney while I fucking come on myself and then  take your mail and have a drunk driving accident.  Ah, Mark Maron is in studio. 
[02:25:00]  He's playing Giggles in Seattle this weekend and, and, and, uh, recording his last CD.  Yeah.  Maybe the last four.  He puts a gun in his mouth.  Um, look, I, you know, I don't want to, because I have found that, you know, suicidal  ruminations, uh, despite the fact, uh, you know, it's all very well and dramatic.  You know, I, I, I'm not depressed.  You know, I just, sometimes I think about suicide.  Sorry, I don't want to kill myself.  It just makes me feel better to know that I can, if I have to, there's nothing wrong  with that.  But, you know, you go in and out of that, you know, right?  You were, you were going through this.  I mean, there are moments where you're so tied up with the pride, with the money idea, 
[02:25:30]  with the feeling of, of not having any control of the situation where, you know, your self  pity gets a bestie and you're just like, fuck it.  No, I went the other way.  It wasn't, it was rage.  Yeah, I was more like, no, not, I was going to kill her, but I wished like natural or just  accidental death on people.  Yeah.  Like I wouldn't go out and think, oh my God, I want to literally kill that person because  I didn't want to end up in prison or anything like that.  But I was like, you know something?  I wouldn't shed a tear over a car wreck or a bolt of lightning. 
[02:26:00]  I was so enraged with utter and sheer hatred of another human being.  It's weird.  You know, it's like, I'm, I'm ashamed to say, especially in, in, in, in, in present company  in the presence of men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, uh, believe me, this is the only show I can talk about this shit on, you know, because,  uh, you know, to some people, you know, I'm still a, a beacon of liberal and progressive  thought.  Sure.  And, uh, I do, I do have that part of me, but I have to indulge this other thing because 
[02:26:30]  the, the, the, the man in me has been awakened.  Right.  With the, uh, the horrendous pain and resentment towards the, uh, members of the opposite sex.  Yes.  Is that in all honesty, I don't know if it's by virtue of the fact that, you know, I've been  sober for a while, but, uh, you know, I, I don't, I, I don't resent her.  Uh, I resent this process that she listened to vindictive cunts who got into her head  because I know my wife, I know who she is.  I was with her a long time.  She was brainwashed by her friends and lawyers. 
[02:27:00]  She was angry at me for taking actions I took after she left me and after I filed for divorce.  After she left you.  Remember that.  That's key.  And I do remember that.  And I know that she was in my heart that she wasn't coming back.  And, and I know that people got into her head and said, here's how you do it.  Because the things she said to me, you know, in the encounters we've had, it didn't sound  like her, right?  It still isn't her.  It doesn't sound like her now.  It's being filtered through her, but it's a lawyer or some bitch friend or some shit. 
[02:27:30]  This is how you hurt him.  You know, this is how, this is how you get back.  Here's how you get up.  That's right.  And, and, and the thing that kills me is that despite the fact that I may, I may have  had a little anger problem, which I do and I got to deal with it.  But I, you know, I have to be honest with you.  I got to be honest with you.  You know, after she left, my anger problem got much better.  Really?  Wow.  Well, of course.  I mean, if you have no one to complain to or yell at, you're going to yell and complain  less, right?  I mean, when you do that by yourself, then you're a lunatic.  You look silly.  Yeah, you're an idiot.  Silly.  So, but, but, but in my heart, the thing is, is that I just, you know, I just, I don't 
[02:28:00]  even know what the hell I'm saying.  You know, the fucking thing is about love is what are you going to do?  I guess it'll just be, it's going to take a little while longer.  A little.  At least two or three more years.  I like seeing this, though, because let me tell you something.  Last time you were in.  Yeah.  You were at a different place.  No, yeah.  In this process.  Yeah.  Now, it's refreshing to see you in this place.  It's better.  You're progressing.  You know what that means?  He's banging young bruts.  You're going on.  Now, here you go, my friend. 
[02:28:30]  This is what you need to do immediately.  Young girls.  Okay.  Let me just lay it out there for you.  Okay.  You are now opened up.  Hold on.  Let me get it.  To the wonderful world of youth.  Yeah.  Well, I find that I'm at that age now where it seems that the 25 is, I'm fine.  Is that your, is that your, uh, your baseline there?  I'm just saying what I'm told, Mark.  I'm just saying what I'm told.  Talk to Anthony.  I'm just saying.  It's not my baseline.  It's not my baseline.  That's, that seems to be what, what is coming at me without working too hard. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  So you don't want to, you know, if you're just out, then those girls will come up to  you.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You put a little effort into it.  They're like, you should get that age down to 20, drive it down to fucking junior high.  Well, you know, I have just found that in, in all honesty, in my life, you know, I, I  don't, I, I, I generally see what, what comes towards me.  And I, I've grown to find that women who, who are attracted to me, no matter what age  they're, they're, they're smart, they're funny, they're cute. 
[02:29:30]  And deep down, they resent every member of my gender and somehow or another, somehow  or another, I'm going to have to pay for that.  It could be in a day.  It could be in a week.  It could be in eight years.  But eventually the problem fellas is that here's the big problem.  All women, they have fathers and you are going to pay for whatever that father did or didn't  do.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Anthony has said that for years.  I, and I, I, when I, I'm a guy, I don't know how many more times I got to stick my cock 
[02:30:00]  into a hurricane.  I don't know how many more times, but if I look into her eyes and there's nothing but  flying debris, okay, I will be like, I'll put my raincoat on and I'm going in there and  there's, you know, there's, there's Barbie parts flying around camp counts where it's  missed rides, you know, and you know, daddy said he was coming and I'm in there with two  things that look like jumper cables wandering around in a, in a, in a storm saying, where's  the broken daddy box? 
[02:30:30]  I'm going to plug directly into it and I'll just hang on for as long as possible.  Oh my God.  You nailed it.  Can I jump in real fast?  My ex, my ex, uh, you know, father's day would come along and all of a sudden she's  like a, an emotional wreck.  I'm like, what the fuck's wrong?  It's father's day.  Cause it reminds her of when daddy left.  Right.  And then all of a sudden we're just going about our lives and all of a sudden I wake up  one morning, she's crying uncontrollably.  I'm like, what, what happened on this date with daddy?  That's the game I would play with her. 
[02:31:00]  Today it's his birthday.  Right.  My wife, my, the day, and this is, this is the God honest truth.  The day she said, you know what?  I'm getting along with my father a lot better.  It was fucking over.  You know what I mean?  Like when she started watching football because her dad watched football and I saw my wife  sitting on the couch going, go, go.  I'm like, what just happened?  Yeah.  What is, who's in my house?  You know?  And that was, and that was the beginning of the end.  And she's exactly like her father. 
[02:31:30]  Here's my ex's story.  Yeah.  Which I should have known immediately.  Right off the bat.  Christmas day.  Yeah.  I love this story.  He leaves the family on Christmas day.  Hold on, Ed.  I need that.  He leaves the family.  Sometimes you don't want to pay for presents.  Goes off, goes off, and starts a brand new family from scratch.  Yeah.  Just from scratch.  And completely forgets about the other family he had. 
[02:32:00]  Men are unbelievable.  I step into this fucking situation thinking everything is going to be hunky dory.  And you are absolutely right.  You will pay for the sins of the father.  And you don't know when it's coming, but it is.  And now my last ex, which is very recent.  Yeah.  I don't know what that is, but, you know, she just recently picked up and left.  Uh, that one, that one, uh, her mom, who now that, uh, I'm broken up with, uh, with 
[02:32:30]  her, is just a fucking cunt.  Who?  My ex-girlfriend's mother.  Yeah.  I fucking hate her.  Uh, anyway.  Wow.  Breaking news.  Anyway.  Anyway.  I'm sitting up.  Anyway.  I was leaning back too far.  Uh, wait, why is this one?  Hold on.  I don't, I, I, I, why is she a, uh, just, you know something when I've dealt with her 
[02:33:00]  over this many years, um, there's just her personality, her, her, uh, uh, connivingness,  uh, the, the, uh, rather work, it's swindling someone than actually work for a fucking living.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  Just, just, I, I fucking grit my teeth thinking how many times I had a smile at her when I  wanted to hit her in the face with a fucking shovel.  Hater.  Hater. 
[02:33:30]  Always did.  So, so you always did and now you can finally say it.  Since day fucking one.  Wow.  You put on a good face, my friend.  Since day, I, I did.  I've hung out socially in that situation with you a few times and it looked like you guys  all got along like you were.  Give me my fucking Academy Award.  You gotta play along.  Cause I fucking did it.  Yeah.  For the relationship.  Why, what, what was the worst thing she did to you?  If you could say, I don't even know.  Said hello.  It doesn't matter.  You just got a sense.  You got a sense right away.  There was a complete lack of any appreciation of anything that I would do helping out family 
[02:34:00]  wise, which that just this.  It's a known fact that Anthony is very generous and helped out a lot of people in, in your  last relationship.  And her past track record of relationships and hatred of men and, and swindling people  out of various goods and things is just legendary.  But that's what they all become when she started the divorce process. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, tell me about it.  That's what they do.  Believe me.  Um, but, uh, she had, you know, three kids with three different men.  This is the woman you were dating?  Yeah.  That wasn't a red flag?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Okay.  I was going to say.  No, no, no.  No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have a fucking wife with a kid.  I date kids.  I don't fucking have women with them.  He fuck kids.  I don't have women with the kids.  Backwards boost.  Exactly.  I, uh, home early, but, uh, the, uh, the, um, uh, the father, so the father wasn't in 
[02:35:00]  her life either for many, many years, you know, he had a drug problem, an alcohol problem  apparently, uh, but he got over that.  I'd met him and he seemed like a nice enough guy and everything.  I had never had a problem with him, but being out of the life so long, there it is again,  maybe a father issue.  I don't fucking know.  I'm going to shrink.  But for some reason, I always hook up with girls that have no fucking fathers. 
[02:35:30]  I like it because I don't have to deal with a fucking father, but there's something there.  You know what?  I've been doing a lot of research on this just at home on my couch by myself with no  books.  Wait, Mark, can you hold my thought?  I'm sorry.  Because you have no idea what he just did here today.  Big time.  Because I'm not, I was thinking in my dopey head that there might be a, a slight chance  that the door is slightly open with him and his ex.  And I, I do believe that door is officially shut. 
[02:36:00]  I don't, I don't go back to exes.  I don't go back to exes.  Even if they come to and say, here's the present.  None of that?  Nothing.  No, I don't go back to exes.  Jose can't say it was walking.  Jose, what's up, buddy?  There it is.  Saved by the bell.  We're talking about, uh, uh, ex-wives, ex-girlfriends.  Ex-wives?  Uh, ex-wives.  That's a good way to look at it.  Their, their, their mothers.  Divorces.  The mother-in-laws.  The friggin, uh, families.  The, the crap.  He looks like Rick Delgado on steroids. 
[02:36:30]  Much better looking.  That's what Rick looked like in any W.  Rick Delgado on steroids.  Uh, yeah, so Mark Marin, he's a, uh, comedian friend of ours.  He's going through a little divorce thing.  Are you going through a divorce right now?  Yeah, I am.  Poor guy.  I went through it.  Can you help me in any way?  Poor guy.  Can you bring him back?  Half.  Ant's been, Ant's still going through a divorce thing.  No, no, I went through it.  It's over.  I just got to pay.  Well, you're still writing some checks.  I still got to pay.  Which are going to end soon, by the way.  How many you had?  Thank God.  Two.  Two divorces?  I'm an expert.  Two divorces. 
[02:37:00]  Did any, did anything go your way in either of them?  Not even close.  Well, well, well, let me rephrase that.  My second wife couldn't break my prenuptial, so that went well at least.  Oh, okay, but she tried.  She tried.  Oh, yeah.  And legal fees?  Up the ass, right?  No, not really, because I had an ironclad prenup, so it was, uh.  Oh, good.  It was pretty clean.  See, that's what you need.  An ironclad prenup to protect my $10?  Believe me, you never know.  Yeah, I have.  You never know.  Look at me.  I was a fucking tin knocker.  Yes.  I was making $28,000 a year, and I married this woman, and then I become a fucking radio 
[02:37:30]  guy making some pretty good change.  Call it a radio.  Okay, I become a radio superstar.  Radio superstar.  Making a pretty good chunk of change.  I didn't know when I was making $28,000 knocking tin crawling in people's attics that I would  need a prenup, but believe me.  If you're a fucking dude, no matter what you do, you should get a goddamn prenup before  you get married, because you don't know what's going to happen in the future.  How awkward is it presenting a prenup?  What's that?  How awkward is it presenting a prenup?  Like, look, I love you.  I want to spend my life with you, but before we consider that. 
[02:38:00]  I don't want to get fucked when we split up.  It's easy when you're already married once and your first wife took half.  But is the second one annoyed that you want the prenup?  But, Jose, we're in love.  This shouldn't happen.  Half.  No.  What do they say?  Well, no.  She was pretty cool about it.  Yeah, pretty cool about it?  Yeah.  They're up for the ride.  They know what they're getting into.  They're going to have a good time either way.  Right.  Hopefully.  What kind of gun did you hold to her head?  You had to, right?  Come on.  You signed his bitch.  He had Luca Brasi.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Luca Brasi made her an offer.  I'll kill you.  Hey, speaking of broads, it's a good place to start.  Baseball players and women on the road.  Jeez.  This is terrible.  Is that a bad place to start?  No, it's a good place.  We have this theory when we see baseball players retire and they're crying their eyes out in front of everybody.  We think it's not that they're going to miss the game.  We think it's because they're going to miss the broads on the road and they're going to be stuck at home with their wife finally. 
[02:39:00]  And now they've got to come up with excuses how to get back on the road so they can bang the broads.  No, I think by that time you're just too old.  You're in your 40s and you're gladly retired.  You're fucked out kind of.  No, I'll tell you.  You're fucked out.  In my heyday, it was pretty crazy.  What kind do you attract?  I mean, comics attract.  You don't even want to know.  But like our baseball groupies, I mean, are they lunatics?  Are they scary?  I guess.  Yeah, I mean, you attract all types.  You attract the scary ones.  What was the scariest one?  Is it true that...  Oh, I'll tell you. 
[02:39:30]  One that actually liked to be choked out while you were having sex.  That was awful right.  Really?  Yeah.  I was like, I'm not touching you again.  No.  You might kill her, right?  I love how he said again.  That means he at least said I'll try this.  I tried it once and after that, forget about it.  Did it freak you out?  Yeah.  It was scary.  Yeah?  Yeah, because her eyes started rolling in her head and it was like, whoa, wait a minute.  You're doing the exercise or what?  It's going to be worse than it probably ever again.  Prison time.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  And she wanted me to squeeze her neck even harder if I was like, what are you kidding  me?  I got to go.  What the fuck is with that?  Would she tap out?  Like, how would it go down?  Would she say, like, you know, squeeze harder, I'm ready to come here?  Yeah.  And her eyes started rolling in her head.  And once I saw that, I was like, this is crazy.  I'm out.  Bye.  No fun, huh?  No, it was crazy.  Wow, that's insane.  The worst is when you think they want that and they don't.  Well, that's a silly explanation.  Are you sure?  Well, you're asking to die.  I was going to say, what can you tell us about the broads on the road, though?  A lot of these guys have a woman in every city. 
[02:40:30]  Well, I can just speak for myself, and you can imagine from there.  But, you know, these women are throwing themselves at you.  I mean, they get by security.  They find out what hotels you're at.  As soon as you go in your door, they're in your room, literally.  They're waiting for you at the hotel bar.  They're kind of, in a way, stalking you, trying to find out where you're at each second.  They're waiting for you after the game.  And, of course, you're, at the time, the best player in the world, making a certain amount of salary and look a certain way. 
[02:41:00]  It's just the inevitable.  You know, they make it very easy.  Do they have baseball cards and they go, fuck them, fuck them, blow them, fuck them, blow them, blow them, fuck them?  Are they looking for relationships or just to get off?  Believe it or not, a lot of them want relationships.  At least they say that anyways.  Wow.  So you can't really figure out, you know, who's who.  That's just the kind of woman you want, someone who stalked you at a bar in a strange city.  Let's start dating, get married, have kids.  That makes sense.  So when that story came out with A-Rod, with that girl in Toronto, you weren't surprised, right? 
[02:41:30]  Absolutely not.  No, I mean, A-Rod's a good-looking guy.  I mean, when all is said and done, he's going to be worth probably $400 million, which is crazy.  So, you know, I see women throwing themselves at him all the time.  He may go to a strip bar, club, none of that.  Even these women who are married are just probably throwing themselves at him.  And, you know, it becomes very difficult to say no at times.  Do you like the guy or do you not like him?  I don't like him.  I don't like A-Rod at all.  I met him when he was very young.  And like I said, he looked at my wife at the time and said, wow, that's a beautiful woman. 
[02:42:00]  All of a sudden, I find out later on that, you know, he's calling her and maybe they hooked up or something.  Wow.  It was kind of bad.  This is the first wife?  Second wife.  Second wife.  Yeah.  So he's a real pursuiter.  He just flirted at a party.  Oh, definitely.  He pursued her.  Was he married at the time?  I'm not sure about the time for him.  I think he was.  What a prick.  God, you could go out there and just fucking grab any chick you want.  That was about the way.  Dominating a male, though.  Right. 
[02:42:30]  That's right.  That was about the woman.  That was about, I'm going to do this to Jose Canseco because you were bigger.  That's animal shit.  It could have been.  And, you know, Jessica, I don't know if you guys saw her in the Playboy issue.  She was a drop-dead gorgeous woman.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  So maybe that had a part to do with it.  But she was your woman.  Right.  She was my wife at the time.  So he just was doing some, you know, lion pack bullshit.  Could have been.  Yeah.  I like the analogy, lion pack.  Well, it looks like you got A-Rod by the balls at this point because you're claiming steroids  with him.  At least he looked into it.  Yeah.  And he's not making a lot of noise because it sounds like you got, like, something in 
[02:43:00]  your back pocket that you're more than willing to use.  This guy, Max, that is in your book, right?  Yeah.  I did introduce him to a one-on steroid dealer.  And, you know, after that, I don't know what happened.  I kind of lost track of it.  But he's definitely not denying it.  So I'm waiting for him to just, you know, fall in that bear trap and say, Jose's a liar  and I'm going to deny it.  You're saying, though, if this gets uglier, you have no problem naming who Max is, right? 
[02:43:30]  Absolutely.  And then it would get very interesting because now Max is going to be on the spot and he's  going to probably say some things.  He'll just say the truth.  Exactly what happened.  You're also defending, you're saying that Clemens' contract of popular belief didn't  do him.  The guy, who was the guy, McNamara, Brian McNamara, I think his name is.  Why, like, are you just protecting a friend or does he really, you really believe he didn't  do it?  Because this guy saved, like, swatches and all this shit.  No, I'm just giving you the information that I've got.  Did I think, especially in my first work or suspect that Roger Clemens used steroids? 
[02:44:00]  Absolutely.  Do I have any evidence whatsoever that he did?  No.  So you're kind of like on the fence.  Did he do it or didn't he do it?  I always suspected him.  I tried to get information from him if he did, but I have no evidence at all.  So do you feel like the players, do they hate you?  I mean, are you hated by players or do some of them kind of like, hey, we like what you're  doing because we didn't do it?  What's the reaction from players?  Serpico.  Are you Serpico?  Well, yeah.  I mean, yeah, yeah.  Even if some of the players do like me, they can't say it because if they're associated 
[02:44:30]  with Major League Baseball or have a coaching job or playing at the Major League level, I  mean, if they say I'm on Jose's side, Major League Baseball will ostracize them and blackball  them and completely get rid of them, absolutely.  Jimmy and I were discussing just before you got here that were you the first guy to do  steroids in baseball or the first big name to do it?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I know I'm the first individual that actually set and broke records while using steroids 
[02:45:00]  and educating other players, and that was to them a great example.  Where did it come from?  Were there guys who had drug dealers?  I mean, when did you first become aware that this was an opportunity and a possibility that  could really change your career?  Well, for me, it was a different story.  For me, you know, in 1984, I was playing with the Modesto A's, which is A-ball, and, you  know, my sister calls me back home, and I go to the hospital, and my mom's brain dead.  And my mom had never seen me play baseball at all, so I promised her on the spot to become 
[02:45:30]  the best baseball player in the world.  Meanwhile, about two months later, I got acquainted and introduced to steroids, and I decided  at that point to use them to fulfill that promise to my mom to become the best baseball  player in the world.  Who was that guy, though?  Was he a skeevy guy, or how did that come about?  No, he was actually a high school friend of mine that was a weightlifter, and he was  using steroids, so I asked him about it.  I played a lot of high school sports.  I mean, steroid use was, like, rampant in high school, so, I mean, to think that these  baseball guys weren't doing it was just stupid. 
[02:46:00]  With the people I hung out with, pot use was rampant.  Right, right.  Yeah, steroids was not even in the picture for me.  No, it was pretty much just, you got a joint.  How do we get a guy to buy a Southern Comfort?  Where are we driving?  Yeah, yeah, got someone to buy us booze and some pot and go to the woods.  You were in the pot click.  Yeah, that was me.  Jose, you know when I knew you were on steroids?  We said it earlier this morning, when you took that baseball off your head, and then  it went over the wall for a home run, and you continued playing, I'm like, wow, that  guy's on something.  Didn't even feel it.  That guy's on something.  Didn't even feel it. 
[02:46:30]  How bad of a fucking teasing did you get from your teammates?  Oh, I mean.  You know what?  It was so funny, because I remember, like, it was yesterday.  This guy from the Cleveland Indians, I forgot what his name is, Martinez, whatever, hits  a semi-line, dry fly bottoming, right field.  And I remember as a child, the first thing they'd tell you is, do not take your eyes off  the ball.  So, first thing I do is, I look at the ball, I run back.  First thing I do is, I look to see where the fence is.  And obviously, there's a warning track. 
[02:47:00]  When you step on it, it feels different, and you know how many feet you have left.  Biggest mistake I made, I looked back to the wall.  Now, then as soon as I looked forward, the ball was already on top of me, hit me on top  of the head.  I slam into the fence almost at the same time.  Ball goes over the wall.  I'm looking on the ground like an idiot around the ball.  Meanwhile, David Holtz in center field is on his knees laughing.  And I swear to you, I'm looking for this ball, and I'm saying, oh my God, look at him.  You know, he's supposed to back me up as an outfielder.  So, yeah, he's laughing on his knees, and I look at him, I go, oh, shit. 
[02:47:30]  No.  Ball went over the fence, went off my head.  That's when I realized I started laughing.  He started laughing.  I think for the rest of the ending, we're just looking at him, just cracking up.  That's a classic clip, man.  No, it was hilarious.  I might be out of school here, because I'm not a big sports guy.  I'm still, in my heart, part of the pot click.  But now, do you, I mean, do you think that not only is steroid is unavoidable,  but there's some people that defend it, and they say that, well, why the hell not? 
[02:48:00]  Let's let them just become these mutants that actually catch the ball with their head eventually.  I mean, do you think that there's something to be said that it shouldn't be stopped?  Well, I mean, it's an illegal substance, so it has to be stopped.  But if it wasn't, I mean, do you think that performance-enhancing drugs will make the game better,  that it takes away the integrity of the game?  Well, if it was legal, no one would have a problem with it, and you see, you know,  these records being broken daily.  But, you know, the bottom line is you can wish for this and wish for that, but it's an illegal substance. 
[02:48:30]  Well, how come then there's people that have such a problem with some of these human growth hormones  and whatnot that weren't barred by Major League Baseball at the time, weren't illegal,  and people were using them, yet they're being ostracized for using them,  even though there were no rules against it.  I mean, that seems odd to me that it's like a witch hunt with people like that.  I understand now you get a new player in there, there are rules now,  you can't use this, you can't use that. 
[02:49:00]  But, I mean, they're going after some players years ago when this stuff was, you know, accepted.  Right, it is a witch hunt, especially going after players, you know, 5, 8, 10 years ago.  Yeah.  But what really happened is that, you know, records were being broken.  It was becoming obvious now that the whole league was on steroids.  And when that happens, when the obvious happens, then I write my book, Juiced.  I mean, something has to be done.  So, I think Congress took the initiative.  How bitter are you at baseball?  Because you had 462 home runs. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, you missed a lot of playing time because of injuries.  I mean, and they say 500 home runs is pretty much your first ballot Hall of Famer.  Your first guy in history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases.  And you get 1% of the vote for the Hall of Fame ballot,  which is, I think, baseball kind of, you know, just sticking it to you.  I mean, how bitter are you?  Well, I knew that was going to happen.  I wasn't bitter because of that.  I was extremely bitter because at 38 years old, 38 home runs short of 500,  I was blackballed from the game of baseball that I love. 
[02:50:00]  All of a sudden, you can't play.  All of a sudden, my agent was calling around and saying, you know,  Jose Canseco will play for free.  They said no.  He said, well, if a major minimum salary comes into play,  he'll donate it to a local charity to get some kids out there.  They said no.  Oh, it's got to hurt.  So, I knew then and there that, you know, I was being blackballed.  And you knew you had a few books in you.  Yeah, at least two.  At least two, right?  But do you feel bad?  Like, are there any of your friends that you've kind of lost?  Like, do you feel like you've hurt any guys that you genuinely liked  and who were like, what the fuck, we were friends?  No, I, you know, I liked them all. 
[02:50:30]  But what happened was as soon as I got blackballed,  everyone turned their back on me.  No one could talk to me.  No one could call me.  I mean, not clubhouse guys, not managers, not, not, no one, not players.  No one could communicate with me.  If Major League Baseball found out they were communicating with me,  they would get also blackballed.  So, it's very tricky.  It's very delicate.  It's like the Red, it's like the, it's like the Hollywood blacklist.  All those guys that were part of the Communist Party, they just,  sorry, man, you're pariah. 
[02:51:00]  That's it.  You're on your own.  It's like when mobsters go to prison.  Do what you got to do.  You're done.  Knowing it's a fraternity, I just don't understand why you would write the books  and just, you know, just ostracize everybody from your life like that.  Well, I was already ostracized without this book.  No if and buts about it.  Now, what I wanted was obviously to mention these players.  I needed one of these players to come by my side and testify on my behalf in Congress  and say, you know what, what Jose says is the absolute truth.  But I underestimate Major League Baseball.  They're so powerful.  They're such a juggernaut that basically they put fear into these baseball players' lives 
[02:51:30]  and said, you know what, you testify on behalf of Jose and said,  go, we're going to do the same thing to you that we did to him.  Right.  Mark McGuire kind of, you guys that played together, I mean, you know, the Bash brothers,  I mean, you guys were just fucking hitting home runs left and right.  And he was obviously, I mean, you said he was doing them.  Right.  Did he sit in front of Congress and just refuse to talk about it?  I mean, I don't think he ever owned up, did he?  Well, I mean, when I testified before Congress, it almost felt like I was in the twilight zone. 
[02:52:00]  All of a sudden, I mean, Sammy Sosa couldn't speak English.  Yeah.  And I've known her.  She was 19 years old and he speaks English.  Well, all of a sudden, I don't know my dirty, you know, no speaking English.  And then Rafael Palmeiro puts on this really bad acting job.  I don't know how to tell you.  I've never used steroids.  I'm like, whoa, what's going on?  And then Mark McGuire, I'm like, doo-doo-doo-doo.  He forgets everything.  He gets abducted by aliens.  He rest his memory.  Hey, let's not talk about the past because I forgot about it. 
[02:52:30]  Let's talk about the present.  I mean, it was crazy.  It was a circus.  There was such a drastic change in his look in such a short period of time from when he  was knocking those home runs and from when he was testifying.  I mean, he was just a giant.  Mark McGuire was bringing huge arms, big neck and everything.  And there he was.  He looked like a bookworm with little glasses on.  And, you know, you've got to think, all right, come on.  Give me a break. 
[02:53:00]  Didn't you write in your book that you injected him?  Yeah, definitely injected him.  Injected Mark McGuire with steroids.  And Rafael Palmeiro.  And Rafael Palmeiro.  Really?  You injected him?  Absolutely.  Wow.  It's funny how McGuire didn't want to discuss the past, yet he didn't mind the past when  it was Maris' home run record.  And he was working on that as he was approaching 60 to 61.  Is it weird, like, injecting, like, another athlete in the ass with steroids?  Is it a little homoerotic?  No.  What goes on there?  How does that go down all the time?  Homoerotic?  You just pull, but you have to pull your...  Oh, my God.  The locker room looked like a shooting gallery on the lower east side. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I mean, it's just the top of the goose muscle.  I was going to say, it's got to be a little weird.  Like, if Jimmy needed the steroids, I don't know if I could put a needle in his ass.  Just don't fucking put him on your dick and use that.  It's just a needle.  It's not like he's totally naked now.  He's just the top of the glute.  I mean, we're all...  Right, right.  I'm just trying to make a joke there, Jose.  Jesus.  You don't take off...  Now, I'm just sitting here thinking, now, could I get on steroids?  Do I have to work out?  Or is there...  Well, if you want to maximize the effect, yeah, you need to work out and diet properly.  Would it help our radio show, you think?  Probably. 
[02:54:00]  Anything could help.  Anything could help.  What about a B12 shot could help at this point?  What about the rumor about your balls shriveling up to the size of raisins or something?  Well, they actually atrophy, but not the size of raisins, but they actually do it.  It doesn't affect the penis at all, but it does atrophy your testicles.  It just makes the balance a little small.  Which can't be a bad thing if you've got hangers.  Make your dick look bigger anyway.  I've never heard anybody have sex with their balls.  Have you talked to Jim? 
[02:54:30]  That's how I showgirl I'm angry.  I shoved the whole bag in there.  I'm like, take that.  Jose, so in the 80s and 90s, what percentage of players do you think were on steroids?  Do you think?  I know it's not an accurate percentage, but...  I mean, at the height of steroid use, it was about 80%.  What?  Wow.  Yeah, it was about 80%.  80% in the 80s and 90s were on steroids?  At the height of steroid use.  Which is about when?  What year?  I'd say...  Mid-90s?  Yeah.  Mid-90s.  80%? 
[02:55:00]  See, you should write a book about the 20% of faggots.  That wouldn't do it.  As a matter of fact, I made a comment.  I said, for the last 10, 15 years, find an MVP that was not on steroids.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Let me throw a name at you, Cal Ripken.  So if you're saying 80% of the ballplayers were on steroids...  He was in the 80s, though, I think.  Oh, you're skirting that one.  No, I never even heard Cal Ripken relate it to steroids.  So he was one of the good ones that possibly avoided it?  Probably.  But if 80%, Jimmy, that's not all home run sluggers. 
[02:55:30]  You know, Rod Carew wasn't.  Yeah.  Rod Carew wasn't my error.  Yeah, slapping at that dumb ball every time he was up.  There's absolutely no way for a guy who doesn't use steroids ultimately to compete with  the team that is on steroids, 80%, that those guys that didn't do it were going to be losers.  I can definitely say the guys on steroids had an edge.  A big edge.  Okay.  Safe to say that a lot of the managers and coaches knew?  I think they all knew. 
[02:56:00]  Absolutely.  You've got to think they all knew if 80% of Major League Baseball on the height of steroids  is on the roids.  Didn't Tony LaRusso admit that he knew?  Well, at first he said he didn't know.  Then he said that he knew that I was using steroids.  But, you know, Tony LaRusso had actually, we used to make fun of him because he used  to have snitches come in the club when the managers weren't allowed and the coaches weren't  allowed in there to actually look around and listen to see what people were doing.  Oh, really?  Do you think he ever manages?  He always struck me as somebody that kind of fucking micromanaged a little bit too much. 
[02:56:30]  Lefty, lefty, righty, righty.  We get it.  Right.  I mean, you know, he was a great manager.  He was a perfectionist.  But it had to be like, it seems to me that I don't know the history of baseball and I'm  speculating here, but at the time when steroids started to get popular, that it probably bolstered  the game.  I mean, that's why the big shots are into it.  It's the money.  You guys are like thoroughbred horses.  They probably knew.  Of course.  The performance goes up.  Baseball was almost dead because of the strike.  And then next thing you know, we got guys hitting five, six hundred foot homers.  Right. 
[02:57:00]  That's why.  You got Sammy Sosa and Mark McGuire in the home run competition they had.  Which I think is a, which was all steroids, right?  It brought the game back.  But you had 46 home runs that year.  I mean, that was not your 46.  That came in like 10th.  You kind of get overshadowed.  And you came in 10th that year?  I was last.  So on some level, steroids saved the game of baseball.  Absolutely.  You know, on some levels, it saved the game.  It brought back the game to the best game in the world.  You know, the home runs, the long ball, the, you know.  Probably that's why the silence, you know.  That's why a lot of people weren't willing to speak up about it.  Right.  Because it was bringing it back. 
[02:57:30]  Now, what turned that around?  What made it so people started saying, hey, got to get these steroids out of baseball?  Well, it wasn't the people in general.  It was the owners in general.  The owners lost control of the salary structure.  Now they're paying players.  It's all money.  Right.  So now if you've got a player that can smash a frigging home run every time he's getting up there,  he's going to demand a lot more money.  Well, the players don't even play every day making $8 million a year.  That's crazy.  Right.  And then you've got your best players making, you know, $20, $30 million.  But once these players went to arbitration, the arbitrator, all he does is look at the stats. 
[02:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  And if your stats fall under a certain category that enables you to make a certain amount of money,  you're going to get paid that kind of money.  And the salary structure just went berserk.  So Major League Baseball said, the owner said, listen, we've got to stop this steroid issue.  We're going to send an indirect signal.  Wow.  We're going to blackball Jose Canseco.  He's the godfather of steroids.  All the players knew it.  They were coming up to me saying, Jose, you're being blackballed.  I said, I know.  They all knew it.  So they said that we made a lot of money in the 80s and 90s. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  You know, and we want to hold on to that money.  Right.  Now we're losing control.  Right.  It's like, you know, money.  You have a controlled fire in your backyard.  You know how to light it.  All of a sudden it gets out of control.  What do you do?  Right.  I mean, you have to control it.  You got to shut it down.  That's exactly what happened.  I'm sorry, Jose.  How about people that say, like, well, steroids might help you hit the ball far, but it doesn't  help you.  It doesn't help.  It doesn't help you concentrate on a ball.  It doesn't help you become like an accurate player.  Your hand-eye coordination is in there.  Right.  Fastball to send it over the fence. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  But then people say that it does help you concentrate.  Like, is that true?  Does it?  I don't think so.  You know, people give steroids way too much credit.  You got to have the natural skill.  You have to have the natural skill.  Let me know Opie's not on steroids.  Concentrating.  What will happen?  What will happen?  I want to get back to Tony La Russa and the managers.  Like, so is it safe to say, like, Joe Torre knew that guys were doing steroids?  I'm safe to say that they own you.  Absolutely.  Every manager.  Absolutely.  How come none of them will speak up?  Like, if there's so many people who stood up and just said, yeah, it's the truth.  Why would they speak up and get fired from Major League Baseball? 
[02:59:30]  What's the upside to speaking up?  There's no upside.  That was just a dumb question.  You're not on steroids either, dummy.  Did George Bush know?  Did George Bush know when he owned the...  I believe he did because when I was traded, the big blockbuster trade from Oakland to Texas,  someone wrote an article saying, I hope George Bush knows that Jose Canseco is a typhoon and marries steroids.  So, I mean, a huge article.  So he must have known.  Did you talk to him?  Everyone else did.  Did you have any?  No.  So the future president of the United States knew. 
[03:00:00]  I didn't know.  Of course.  You know what I learned today?  I didn't know it was 80% of the players.  That just amazes me.  I really thought, like, I think Jimmy kind of said it.  It was like home run hitters, power hitters.  It was everyone.  No, pitchers, the whole gamut.  Bat boys.  Yeah, bat boys.  Big, just bulked up bat boys coming out.  Yeah.  What's the side effects of steroids?  We've heard all sorts of things over the years.  I don't think anyone knows what the long-term side effects are because obviously they're illegal.  No experimentation has been done on a human subject. 
[03:00:30]  So we don't...  I don't think anyone knows.  Well, what's happened to the guys that have been doing it since the 80s?  I mean, the human subject, they took it upon themselves to go ahead and do them.  What have been the repercussions of guys that you know?  Well, I have not heard of any deaths directly linked with steroid use.  Just deaths that are trying to stop a moving car because you think you can.  Well, that's a psychological problem.  I know in professional wrestling, which has had its scandals as far as steroids go, there  have been a lot of deaths that people have attributed to steroid use. 
[03:01:00]  Well, and then they've done the autopsy and they've checked the blood levels and they've  got steroids, they've got cocaine, they've got heroin and speed in their system.  Which one do you attribute it to?  Jesus Christ.  Wow, right, right.  Are you still doing them at all?  Like just to stay in shape or to just totally stop?  I don't use anything illegal.  No.  Mm-hmm.  None of that.  Oh, it's illegal.  Actually, I didn't...  It was illegal like against the law law.  You've got to have a prescription for it.  You've got...  Ironically enough, it's real easy to get.  If you...  They did an article saying that 60% of the men in the United States have low testosterone levels. 
[03:01:30]  You just go to a doctor and say, listen, check my blood levels.  Oh, you've got low testosterone level?  They prescribe you steroids.  Would that help with rods?  Would that help with erections?  Hmm.  I'm sure yeah.  I'm sure yeah.  They got another drug for that.  As a matter of fact, they use that for therapy.  They use testosterone therapy for...  Let's look forward to a bulked up Jimmy.  Yeah.  I fucking love Cialis.  Fucking three days later, you're like, oh, I'm a fucking real man.  It's fantastic.  But I didn't know...  Three days later.  Well, I mean, it just stays in your system.  It's really great stuff.  Jimmy wrapped some pine tar around the base. 
[03:02:00]  Unbelievable.  To get a good grip.  Sammy, I know it's a stupid question.  You don't regret doing it, though?  Like, you don't...  Like, we see the path that it kind of took you on, or, like, you don't regret having  taken them?  I do regret it, but, you know, I had the best intentions when I actually did it, to become  the best baseball player in the world for my mom, who died.  And I had the best intentions, but things didn't turn out right.  Do you regret naming names, or are there any names that you kind of wish you hadn't, even  though you were being honest?  No. 
[03:02:30]  No, I really don't regret that.  What I regret was that none of these players came to my side.  Not one.  Again, where's the upside, though, you know?  Exactly.  Where's the upside?  They're not going to...  No, they're not going to...  They saw what happened to me, and they were going to put themselves in that kind of position.  There's too much money to be made in baseball.  I'm going to miss steroids in baseball.  I've got to be honest with you, because I don't really care what happens to you guys after  your days are done.  And I love...  We're useless after that.  I mean, you guys don't...  You know, you don't care about the fans, for the most part, about their lives. 
[03:03:00]  I don't care about...  I want to see 500-foot homers.  I want to see pitchers throwing 100 miles an hour.  I don't care.  Weird mutants running down the basin.  It's kind of a hacky bit, but they talk about all the drugs that made music what it is today,  you know?  Right.  And now you're taking the drugs away from these musicians, what crap we'd be hearing on the  radio.  American Idol.  I'll tell you guys a true...  Yeah, exactly.  That's what happened.  This is a true statement.  Before steroids, there was marijuana and cocaine and liquor.  When steroids came in, everybody went on this health diet with steroids and supplements 
[03:03:30]  and all that.  Marijuana was gone out of the game, cocaine was gone, and liquor was gone.  See, that's...  Imagine that.  On who the...  Who has the real balls?  Mickey Mantle, who could hit Homer's shit face.  Yeah.  All right.  Or a guy juiced up.  I want to know what Babe Ruth was on, because like everyone had...  Hot dogs.  He was fucking hot dog and liquor.  Yeah.  Everyone had an edge.  Women.  Whether it was steroids or other shit over the years.  And he's an American icon.  Yeah.  And, you know, was doing the same thing basically that the athletes are doing today with the 
[03:04:00]  women.  And I get...  You can exchange the steroids for the liquor and so forth.  But the guy you can play fucked up.  Oh, yeah.  That's the real hero.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were talking about how the players didn't come to your side and, you know, stick up  for you.  You must have had certain players that just wanted to kick your ass or call you a rat  or some shit.  I mean...  Actually, players didn't make that comment.  Fans did.  I guess I'm speaking for the players.  But players really didn't get involved at all.  Really?  You didn't have anybody that was like, ah, Jose, what the fuck are you doing? 
[03:04:30]  I was going to...  I'm like, who's going to stand towards this guy?  Another guy that's his size.  That's on roids?  Yeah.  Like fellow players, maybe.  No.  Would be like, Jesus Christ, you know, you're stirring up this shit.  No.  No?  We never had that because the players knew I was telling the truth.  Hey, what's going on with Barry Bonds in your humble opinion?  Obviously, he wants to continue playing.  No one wants to pick him up.  He's done.  But, I mean, he could probably hit 20 or 30 homers this year and it would be good for  attendance for some of these teams that aren't going to do that well this year.  Well, then it would have to be an American League team. 
[03:05:00]  Obviously, he'd just be able to do that.  But what's the deal there?  I mean, he obviously has a year or two left in him and I heard they took down all his  signage at the stadium and stuff.  They want to make believe they don't even know him anymore.  It's very simple.  The deal is, they don't know if they're going to convict him of perjury or not.  Imagine if a team signs him in the middle of the season and he gets convicted.  So, I mean, you just can't do that.  You just can't take that risk.  They want to keep that nice family.  His head got big.  I mean, he's played already for 20 some odd years.  He's 44 years old. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, geez, he's broken all kind of records.  I mean, the man is...  Will they remove records at all, do you think?  I mean, there's always this stupid thing with the Astros because he played a few more games  in Babe Ruth, but they won't take records.  They can't do that.  No, they can't.  There's no way of judging what steroids did to whom and who really used steroids.  Sure, maybe some of them got caught, but what about the guys that slipped under the radar?  You can't tell.  Well, nobody wants to Carl Yastrzemski.  What was that?  The year of the pitcher?  I mean, he hit like...  It was one guy in the league, hit 300.  He hit like 301.  Nobody wants that anymore.  People like to see a fucking offensive game. 
[03:06:00]  But there must have been some guys...  These guys were talking about the fans.  There must have been some division among the fans.  It would seem to me that the older guys, the older fans, were probably supporting you.  Am I right?  Some, in the very beginning, were supportive.  Very little.  They thought I was lying.  But then, when they found out I was telling the truth, they all supported me.  Right.  They made high fives.  I'm glad you did that.  The old guys, right?  Right, right.  I mean, it was kind of like a mixture here and there.  But, you know, hopefully this will bring back the game to how it used to be. 
[03:06:30]  I don't know if it's going to continue to be as exciting,  but if you look at the number of fans that are coming out, they've definitely increased.  You think it's also a lot of the guys that made whatever they made per year,  and now they're going out to make their living just signing.  They see a guy like A-Rod making a $252 million contract,  and they're like, ugh.  So they have to be happy to see some of these guys at least being embarrassed publicly or...  Well, humanized, really.  Jose doesn't like A-Rod.  You really don't like A-Rod?  No.  I don't like him. 
[03:07:00]  Would you like to smack him if you could?  If you could do it and get away with it,  would it just feel good, just one crack to that dumb smiling face of his?  At least four or five.  Oh, I like that.  Good.  Is he the guy you hate the most in the game?  Yeah.  I would definitely say that.  Wow, look at the look here, Jose.  Jose's not happy.  Jose's a fucking problem.  You don't want to tangle with Jose.  You've had a couple of...  Jose, are you writing these books for the money?  A little bit, too?  A little bit in there?  No.  You've got a nice opportunity there?  Because the books come out right around opening day and all. 
[03:07:30]  It's perfect timing.  Yeah, it's the timing of the publishers, really.  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah, they actually predict when the books come out.  I have nothing to do with that.  Do you have enough money to live, do you think?  Yeah.  I just wanted people to know the truth.  I wanted them to know what happened.  Then I wanted a follow-up to the first book to see that I was completely right,  and I was vindicated, and people have changed their opinion about me completely now.  Isn't that funny about the truth, though?  Like, you know, it's a weird thing.  When you do tell the truth about something, you get that weird double-edged thing where  people are like, you know, we really appreciate your honesty. 
[03:08:00]  Now get the fuck out of it.  Yeah, sometimes it's funny.  The truth is not accepted.  It never is.  Are you kidding?  It's strange.  Yeah.  If you tell the truth, people are like, we appreciate that, but you can't come to dinner  anymore.  You upset my wife.  You want to take some phone calls?  Sure.  Let's do it.  All right.  Let's see what these guys got.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris, what's going on?  Hello?  Chris?  Maybe we'll get A-Rog a call in.  They're going to rain out.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  What's up?  What's going on, man? 
[03:08:30]  This fucking guy's an asshole.  Why is he an asshole?  I'm saying he's Marc Maron.  Wait a minute.  Fucking rat.  Rat, he said.  I told the truth.  Hello?  No comment after that?  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy?  Hey, I got a couple questions for Mr. Canseco.  Yeah.  What hand did you beat your wife with?  My wife's with?  He couldn't even get it out.  He's all nervous and pleasant. 
[03:09:00]  But it's so easy to ask these questions on the phone.  Yeah, he was all brave to ask it on the phone.  Could you come in here and ask this gentleman that same question?  And see what hand he hits you with if I see you.  Choke you out and fuck you.  Well, it was well documented that you had some issues with some wives.  And people called it roid rage.  That wasn't even close.  If you analyze the first domestic violence issue, two cars collided.  And when you think of domestic violence, you do about a man striking a woman.  Right.  Not two cars colliding by accident. 
[03:09:30]  It's just ridiculous.  And the other one, yeah, okay, I pulled my ex-wife's hair.  Big whoop.  I pulled her harder than having sex.  And?  And?  What?  If you were with that girl on the road, you liked the chokes, you would have thought it was  very similar.  There you go, I'm telling you.  Yeah, that would have been a good orgasm for her.  I had an incident once, it never went anywhere.  I love how you have to like preface it.  It never went anywhere.  You were on the road, an orgasm?  This was, no, this was, I'm not even going to say who it was or anything, but I was with  a girl.  And this other girl that seemed to think we had a relationship was in the same bar. 
[03:10:00]  And she was very mad.  And the girl I was with then called the other girl a cunt.  So the other girl went to attack the girl I was with.  So I had to hold her back.  But she was really drunk.  And she started weaving a little bit.  And I was trying to guide her out the door, out the front door.  She tripped right in front of the jukebox.  And her head went right into the jukebox.  And it looked like I took her and threw her into the jukebox. 
[03:10:30]  While you were choking her.  While I was choking her and fucking her.  But, yeah, and I was really just, I had her by the shoulders and was trying to guide her  toward the door.  And she was fighting to get, you know, get away.  Domestic violence.  And that could have been domestic violence.  Absolutely.  You know, the whole bar wasn't laughing their asses off instead of calling 911.  Let's go to Don in Jersey.  Don, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I got a question for Jose.  First, I respect what he did because he actually told the truth. 
[03:11:00]  Thank you.  Um, I'm not asking you to say something that you don't know for a fact, but your speculation,  do you think Jeff Bagwell was doing steroids?  My speculation?  Yes.  All right, but you don't have any facts on that.  No, but he was, uh, talked to, uh, you know, that incident was talked about amongst players  that he was using steroids.  Which incident?  Bagwell.  He's got a great reputation and everybody says he didn't do what he didn't do.  He just broke down, but.  Well, Mark McGuire had a great reputation also. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, but if you do steroids properly, it's been documented how it breaks your body down.  I don't, I don't believe there's been any long-term documentation of any, you know, steroid use.  When you're doing steroids and you continually work out, work out, you don't give your muscles  any time to heal, doesn't it cause damage?  If, if you overdo it and mix it with other chemicals, probably.  Right.  Yeah.  That's what I was referring to, but I respect what you did and you guys suck.  Jimmy, you're great.  I know nothing about, about steroids, but I would assume that like anything else in 
[03:12:00]  some type of moderation, uh, it probably isn't as bad for you as if you're just using too  much of it.  Like anything else, you know, somebody sits around and, uh, and, uh, smokes a little pot  every so often.  It's not like the guy that's just constantly stoned.  I'm starting to think the only guys that weren't doing steroids in the eighties and nineties  were guys that were just scared, just scared to do it. 
[03:12:30]  Pussies.  You're saying, Opie.  Yeah.  Pussies.  Bunch of pussies.  It gets into a maintenance situation.  Middle relievers and pussies.  Scared of needles.  It gets into a maintenance situation.  So it becomes hard to be prudent or casual about it cause you got to maintain it, right?  It's a matter of timing too.  Eventually I think if I would have not have written this book, everyone would have been  used to steroids.  So it's just a matter of time.  Mariano Rivera couldn't be doing steroids.  He weighs 90 pounds.  It couldn't be.  He was a lot bigger than he used to be.  Maybe he was one of them who was not.  Who knows?  Hey, Jose.  Use him as a needle when he was skinny. 
[03:13:00]  No, nothing.  Hold on.  Jeff in Staten Island has something.  I don't know if you want to answer this, but ask Jose what the guy in the stands at Yankee  Stadium said to him that got him so pissed off he had to be restrained.  Oh.  Do you remember that answer?  I remember that.  I remember that.  I think he, oh, I think that was in 1991 when I actually, the night before I went out  with Madonna and the next day was all over the media, the papers, I think he had said  something really nasty about Madonna and my wife at the time that they were getting 
[03:13:30]  it on.  It was something crazy and stupid.  And he kept on saying it and saying it and saying, he's some really nasty things.  And I just turned around and told him, you better shut up.  You better shut up.  And he didn't, obviously.  And he left.  Did you have sex with Madonna?  No, I did not.  But you did introduce her to steroids, obviously.  Look at that fucking body of her performance.  My God.  Let's say hi to Todd in Connecticut.  Todd.  Hey, morning. 
[03:14:00]  How are you, Anthony?  Hello, Jimmy.  Hey, man.  Hey, Jose.  I'm a big Red Sox fan.  I was just wondering.  You played for the Red Sox.  I haven't seen none of their names in there.  Do you know if any of those guys took steroids?  Like Big Papi or Manny?  Well, I didn't know Big Papi personally or Manny Ramirez personally.  They didn't play on the Red Sox team when I was there.  So I really have no opinion on that.  So you didn't see anything happening on in the clubhouse then?  No, because they weren't there when I was there.  Oh, okay. 
[03:14:30]  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Massachusetts.  Dave.  Yeah, he says he told the truth and he's sitting there like Mr. Morality,  but you're profiting from it and personal gain at the expense of other people's reputations.  What do you got to say about them?  I'm definitely profiting from it.  I mean, if you write a book, we all work and we all do things to profit from.  Absolutely.  But the main issue was, you know, I needed to tell my story.  Absolutely.  And we already talked about this.  It wasn't an attack on these actual players. 
[03:15:00]  The attack was, that's fine.  You can say whatever you want.  It doesn't bother me one bit.  Believe me.  And the book is called Vindicated and it's put out by Simon Spotlight Entertainment.  They have a reputation for doing just excellent, excellent books.  Wasn't this the OJ people?  I wouldn't know.  Jose, was it?  The OJ book that got out?  No, I think that was HarperCollins, wasn't it?  Oh, okay.  Probably, yeah.  It's a shitty company.  Oh, right, yeah.  Simon Spotlight Entertainment is known, but what they do is they deal with quality only.  Ah. 
[03:15:30]  What other publisher did you have, Jimmy?  Doesn't matter.  Same one.  Simon Spotlight.  Let's go to Wisconsin.  Paul, what's up?  We got Jose Canseco in studio.  What's up, Paul?  Well, first, I want to thank you for your book and what you've done.  Sure.  I'm a big baseball fan.  I'm very happy with what you did.  But I want to ask about Derek Jeter, if there's any possibility you ever see him with steroids  or anything like that.  I'll hang up and hear your answer.  No, I don't think so.  He's never been mentioned in any circles. 
[03:16:00]  And when I played with the Yankees those two months, no.  It's so interesting.  These guys are calm because they're like, what about my hero?  Oh, I know.  That's what I'm getting to.  What about my mother?  It wouldn't surprise me if Jeter did him, though.  It made him so fucking strong and blowing off fans.  That prick.  Yeah, Jimmy used to be a big Jeter fan until he blew him off.  He was very hurtful.  He now hates all of the Yankees because of Derek Jeter.  No, you know who I like?  Oh, I was imagining him.  You know who I like the most out of the fucking Yankees that I met?  Alex.  Oh, that's a fucking jizz bag. 
[03:16:30]  I don't like A-Rod.  He's never going to win anything.  He's one of those guys he just won't win.  He couldn't win with the fuck.  The Mariners couldn't win with him and stupid Randy Johnson and Edgar Martinez.  He's never going to win.  Was Jason Giambi was the nice Yankee I met.  Yeah.  And I think people like him because he kind of came out and apologized, and I think he  just stopped.  Right.  I mean, he was honest about it.  I said, listen, I made a mistake, and that's it.  Right.  I mean, everyone was doing it.  I was trying to help our team, our city, our players.  And you move on.  One more question here. 
[03:17:00]  Chuck in Jersey.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to ask him about what happened with Maglio Ordonez when he accused him of doing  steroids.  No, actually, Maglio, I guess I wrote an article.  And the article was about that I was trying to distort money from Maglio Ordonez.  Meanwhile, the article also states that I never spoke with Maglio.  I never spoke with his agent.  No one there.  And I actually did a poll. 
[03:17:30]  You wanted money to keep him out of your second book.  But this is what I'm talking about now.  Okay.  That never happened.  And then, finally, I took a polygraph on it and passed it completely.  That never took place.  I'll only say this.  I don't know what happened with Jose and Ordonez.  But if there was a blackmail thing, don't you think that they would have set you up to  take the hit?  Like, if you were trying to blackmail them, don't you think that they would have?  Absolutely.  They'd probably take my phone calls and record them.  So that never happened.  Are you at peace as far as the Hall of Fame goes, Jose? 
[03:18:00]  Absolutely.  You are?  It's a rough one, though, no?  I don't think, you know, even if the steroid era didn't exist, I wouldn't be inducted anyways.  I just don't have the stats.  How many games did you miss, though?  I mean, roughly.  I don't know exactly.  You know, I had three, four back surgeries, elbow surgery, hand surgery.  So I must have missed a total of three, four years.  You and Pete Rose just egged the place on Halloween.  Toilet paper.  Yeah.  Bud Selig's house.  We go by there with about 50 dozen eggs. 
[03:18:30]  Just egg laughing, drive away.  Yeah, what about past commissioners of baseball?  They were aware of the steroid thing, too?  Absolutely.  I mean, Bud Selig's most absolutely aware of it.  They just didn't do anything about it.  That's all.  Isn't he a Dr. Bud Selig, or am I completely wrong?  Yeah, I'm wrong.  That makes it even worse.  I don't know if he is or not.  I don't know why I'm thinking Dr. Bud.  Maybe I'm confused.  What we learned today is that everyone knew.  Yes.  When it was being done.  When it was good for the game, who was going to say anything?  Absolutely.  They were cashing checks.  Right.  Who's going to, you know, if it's not broken, don't fix it. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  Who's going to say something?  But then the second the owners, as Jose said, the second the owners started seeing, oh, we're  paying a lot of money for these monsters.  Too much money going out.  We're going to have to, you know, kind of leak this out.  Right.  Hey, Jose, it's obvious that we're all just getting along here.  We're pals.  So why don't you give us a huge exclusive right now?  Something you haven't told anyone else.  I've told everyone everything in this book.  How about just one thing that'll get us, like, international news? 
[03:19:30]  Let's go.  One player.  President Bush did steroids, right?  No.  I'll tell everyone.  I injected you before.  Oh, that's it.  There it is.  O.P.  I knew it.  A-Rod used to go from hamper to hamper smelling athletic supporters.  Just something we can use.  That fucking no winning bum.  Oh, we got the great Jay Moore on the line here.  Jay Moore.  Hey, Jay.  How are you, buddy?  Hiya, boys.  Jose Canseco looking good.  Thank you.  How are you doing?  Feeling good. 
[03:20:00]  You guys finally met a guy that blinks more than Jimmy.  That's why I wear glasses.  Yeah, you blink a little bit there, Jose.  What's that about?  I do the same thing.  Probably my two marriages.  Nerves?  Nerves?  Right.  My divorces.  There you go.  I hope nerves.  I don't know.  I've gotten a slight twitch myself.  What?  I love the book, Jose, and I can't wait to get vindicated.  Have you read Juicing the Game?  No, I have not.  That's a pretty good long, like, it's like a tome. 
[03:20:30]  It's like 800 pages, and it basically just explains what you've been saying for years of,  you know, how baseball turned its back because it was so good after the strike for all these guys to be hitting bombs.  Right.  And then people say, you can't, steroids isn't a baseball drug, and all these doctors testify about how it's the perfect steroid drug.  Right.  I mean, it's the perfect steroid sport, I should say.  Steroid sport, and it works.  With the twitch response and the slow twitch with the long season and the anaerobic plus the aerobic energies wasted and spent, but also... 
[03:21:00]  Dr. Moore.  Yeah, you a doctor?  Yeah, I might as well have been.  You should have seen the weight I put on for the Street Kings movie.  I put on 30 pounds.  I'm more amazed that Mr. ADD read an 800-page book.  Yes, that's a long book.  How'd you get past page two?  Fucking Cliff Notes asshole, we know what you're doing.  Right, exactly.  You know what?  You'd be surprised between the Nixon and Truman biographies.  That was like a year of my life.  I'll never get back. 
[03:21:30]  Jimmy, where are you performing this weekend?  If I wanted to come see you.  No.  You know what, Jay?  I'll be in New York.  I'm not doing any road gigs.  Hey, Jay, I'll be in Seattle.  Jay, we got Marc Maron at Giggles in Seattle.  Jay, did we do all right with the interview?  Is there a question we didn't ask?  Was that Marc Maron?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi, pal.  What's up, buddy?  Like I said, ADD, Jay.  I'm one of the few people who are not angry around.  Jay, is there anything about Marc and I?  We just kind of rub each other the right way.  And oddly, too.  Like you wouldn't put us in the same room usually. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, well, we've gotten along because I tolerate you.  Yeah.  That's nice.  I love you, man.  Jay, we work in Seattle.  June 28th, I'm at the Pageant Theater in St. Louis, right?  Very nice.  Jose Canseco's got a book out and did he pork at Janice Dickinson in The Surreal Life?  Not even close.  I'll tell you something funny.  Makeup does wonders for her.  I forgot about that show, man.  Makeup barely does wonders for her.  Yeah.  No, it really helps her because darn. 
[03:22:30]  I was in Matt.  She was like Madam.  Darn.  She was like Madam.  But you know, Jay, you're asking.  I'll leave you guys to your interview.  By the way, congrats on Leslie Nielsen.  I loved it.  Oh, you heard that one?  He didn't.  He didn't really hear it.  Did he bring his fart machine?  Oh, God, yeah.  He was on the phone.  Jay, you're a big sports guy.  Did we ask everything or what?  Are we missing something here?  Pretty much.  It's too bad about the back surgeries because Jose was on the fast track for the Hall of Fame.  Absolutely, he was.  You see my friends play this game all the time. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, does Don Mattingly belong in the Hall of Fame?  Absolutely, yeah.  Even though he retired because he had one back surgery, I think.  That knocked him out of the game, but definitely.  He's a pussy.  His last season, he had like 49 runs batted and like seven home runs, but he was fucking  injured.  Yeah, the injuries.  But the guy, you got to keep in mind, Don Mattingly and Kirby Puckett's numbers are exactly  the same.  The only difference is the rings.  And Don Mattingly never raped someone blind with pot with glaucoma.  Joe Girardi, greatest slugger of all time. 
[03:23:30]  Go.  Go.  Joe Girardi.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm going to do my impression of Ahmad Rashad interviewing Jose Canseco, okay?  All right.  All right.  Jose, share will.  Whatever you said.  Remember when he used to swing for Michael Jordan's balls?  He would just go up to Michael and not ask anything.  Just go, Michael, intensity. 
[03:24:00]  Fucking Jay, man.  Well, I really, oh, does Rowan still work?  I got a lot of catching up to do because I'm finally back at work, so I'm up early to call  you guys more.  Does Rowan still work there?  Yes, he does.  Well, he's here.  I don't know if you guys know this, but he talks exactly like Taro Reed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You have to look into that.  He does.  And then when he's done, he kind of goes, I don't know.  Yeah.  All right, that's it.  Jose, I met you at, you probably don't even know who I am.  I met you at 24 Hour Fitness. 
[03:24:30]  I'm the comic, Jay Moore.  Okay.  And you were doing, that's the, like, I have no fucking idea.  You just got an okay.  If you, Jay, my dick got hard from that response.  You know how happy that made me?  That's exactly the response I've gotten from every famous person I've met more than once.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Thank you.  Here's the strange part about Jose Quintetro.  He's at 24 Hour Fitness.  First of all, he's like, you know, a fucking borderline hall of famer.  He works out like where I work out, and the Persian people in the valley of L.A.  I don't want my fucking 400 plus home run hitters, I don't want to wait for the tricep extension 
[03:25:00]  between him and some fucking hairy Persian lady.  And he's sitting on a bench, and for a half hour, this fucking mental patient is working wrists.  I go, he's like, I'm just working wrists.  Stay, blink, blink.  Just staying in shape.  He wants to keep his smack in shape.  Holy smokes.  He just sat there working wrists.  Forearms.  They call forearms.  They call forearms.  Yeah, you do that.  All right.  Thanks, Jay. 
[03:25:30]  I'm going to mention where Jose is doing some signings, too, man.  Because there's obviously going to be a line.  The book is called Vindicated.  I think it comes out today, right?  Is it today?  Oh, yeah.  I think it's last Thursday.  It came out, but the little push was yesterday and today.  Oh, okay.  Last Thursday.  What an ill-informed asshole I am.  All right.  Well, it's out now, so fucking buy it.  Hey, sir.  Did we do a good job for you over there?  You guys did fantastic.  We love your show.  You guys did a great job.  We really appreciate you.  Oh, thank you very much, Jeff Garland.  That's my 330-pound attorney.  He's a nice boy.  Obviously, he's on the roids, too. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, we got the sign.  I'm going to plug.  Is there a website?  First of all, I'll give out two things.  Today, at 3.30, there's a great independent bookstore in Ridgewood, New Jersey, called Bookends,  which is a great place.  You can get a lot of people in there for a signing.  And then tomorrow, if you can't get out to Jersey today, here in New York, at 12.30,  the Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue.  I think that's Union Square.  Am I correct?  Correct.  It's a massive one, too, so don't worry about not getting...  Well, if you use the square one, it's the other one. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, it's not?  No.  Fifth Avenue and what?  Do you have a cross street?  46th.  Okay, 5th and 46th.  Yeah, nobody tells me anything.  They just give me fucking 500 dates here.  But either way, 5th Avenue and 46th, Barnes & Noble, 12.30 p.m. tomorrow.  Today at 3.30, Bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  And is there a website where you can get the rest of the signings?  JoseConseco.com.  Nice.  Okay, good.  I'm surprised some cyber squatter shit didn't grab that.  No shit.  How does Jose Canseco have his name and Jim Norton has taken?  It fucking disturbs me.  Sonny Ferelli from Boston writes, ask Jose about Goody Two Shoes, Curt Schilling. 
[03:27:00]  What about Curt?  Oh, what a hypocrite that guy is.  Oh, my God.  He made such a big fool of himself before Congress that one of the congressmen had to reprimand him.  He's just ridiculous.  That guy's an idiot.  Why don't you...  How did he make a fool of himself?  I don't remember.  Aside from his fucking tampon sock, which was fake.  Well, I mean, yeah.  I mean, at first they had him on this task force for Congress to stop steroids.  Then he says, right in front of Congress, there's not a problem. 
[03:27:30]  There's no steroid problem.  Then in an article a few months back, he says, there is a steroid problem.  So which one is it?  Is there a steroid problem or is there not a steroid problem?  He was just blabbing out left and right.  And in your opinion, was he on the roids?  Curt?  No.  No, I don't think so.  Two goody, two shoes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Just a fucking wispy-haired asshole.  Nobody likes Schilling.  Fuck you and you're killing the Yankees with the Red Sox and with those dirty fucking Diamondbacks. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Randy Johnson.  Homosexual?  No.  Fucking hate him.  That'd be a big one.  Oh, he certainly would.  Did they call him the big unit because of his cock?  That's the rumor.  No, I don't know about that one.  Well, I mean, it was just the rumor.  Not that I would, you know.  Maybe because he's 6'10"?  Yeah, he really is.  That's fucking lumbering John Holmes idiot.  He falls into a well.  Fucking hate him.  He's done nothing but murder the Yankees his whole shitty career.  Fuck.  All right, we're going to let Jose go.  Yes.  Very busy man.  The book, of course, is called Vindicate, available in bookstores and on Amazon.com. 
[03:28:30]  And thanks for the honesty, man.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you soon with my third and fourth and fifth book.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Are you guys in it?  And don't get married again.  What the fuck?  Don't.  Oh.  All right, guys.  Take care.  I'm Clad Preenup.  All right, let's take a break.  Thanks, man.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Goddamn ridiculous.  I need to be a shock talk. 
[03:29:00]  Always up to no good.  Be a man.  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is, like, the number one show in the world.  So, getting back to Anthony's ex's mother. 
[03:29:30]  What?  When we were, was that what we were talking about when Jose Canseco walked in?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You shocked a lot of people today with that.  And then people on Instant Feedback are like, wow, Anthony just got saved by Jose Canseco.  You would have, somebody wrote, oh, you could have rode that till 11.  No problem.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, I could.  You're calling your ex's mother a car.  I can't even say the word.  Yeah.  It's tough for me to say that word.  I mean, I did.  I say it, but.  Although, just call it the C word. 
[03:30:00]  The C word.  We'll just call it the C word today.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I thought you all got along.  A little bit of a revelation.  I like my ex's mother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for you.  I just did.  I just.  Mark there in the studio, by the way.  You know, I did things and said things for the better of the relationship.  Yeah.  And it's not like people didn't know that.  I think it's not like my ex didn't know that.  But.  It's just the way I felt.  But, you know, I kept up a good front.  Yeah.  Because, you know, non-confrontational Anthony. 
[03:30:30]  That's me.  That's why I'm beloved.  Yeah, I know.  I feel that.  And, yeah.  You know.  I just want you to lose your shit one fucking day.  That's all I ask.  I have.  Not so much.  I want you to, like, put fists through monitors.  I want you to.  Oh, now that's you.  Kick down doors.  I want.  Look in the fucking mirror if you want to see that.  I want to see windows broken.  Wait till I.  I've shot my computer, for fuck's sake.  I put a round through my computer.  Hey.  I'm more into guns anyway. 
[03:31:00]  We can do a couple things.  We got to make sure people don't forget that we started a war with WEEI.  Maybe they could call from the battlefront and tell us how it's going so far.  Also, it's our 10th anniversary of our April Fool's prank that we did on Boston.  Telling the city the mayor died.  Yeah.  We actually got the clip that started it all.  It's so famous.  And news stories.  I don't even know if we want to go there.  And I got an observation.  You are hot!  Not him!  You!  Me, Opie?  Not you.  Janine is a piece of ass! 
[03:31:30]  And it needs to be said loud!  Regular at FH Riley's.  I bet you don't even know who that is.  Of course.  Is that J9?  Huh?  That's Janine.  I know who she is.  Janine.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Janine did some audio clips for us.  She's the voice of the whole.  But...  Right.  She...  Is it safe to say you were a big, fat person?  I was a giant, fat person.  Jesus Christ.  You lost a lot of weight. 
[03:32:00]  A lot of weight.  Well, that's what we're getting at.  Now, wait.  I got to turn off a mic.  There's like...  Ah, fuck it.  Who gives a shit?  I completely didn't recognize her.  That's what I'm saying.  Now, she's in tiny little jeans.  Janine, how much did you used to weigh?  My highest was 314.  That girl right there used to weigh 350.  314 pounds.  314 pounds.  314.  A year ago.  You're about 314.  Wow.  Look, if I was...  I would only wish I was a size 14 back then.  I was like a size 26.  Oh, my God. 
[03:32:30]  314 pounds.  You must feel like you're floating.  And only when I'm in water.  I'm trying to remember, like, what the fuck you looked like.  She was...  I mean, she was...  You were always...  You were always cute, but you were huge.  What did Obi say about you when you were standing through the window one time?  What's the heavy one going to do?  Yeah, with some...  Oh, the heart.  I don't think he said heavy.  So, I'm the reason why you lost...  He was exactly it.  Yeah?  So, I'm the reason you lost almost 200 pounds, huh?  Great.  A little bit.  How'd you do it?  What are you down to now?  I know it's not...  Huh?  Now, I'm...  As of now, I'm like 137. 
[03:33:00]  Jesus Christ.  Are you eating better and stuff like that?  Oh, yeah.  Are you exercising?  Yeah, tons of protein.  Look, I need more exercise than I'm getting, but...  Yeah, I'm a lot of skin.  That's great.  Oh, really?  I'm a lot of skin.  The smaller I get, the bigger my underwear gets.  It's just like from here to here.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, you know, you weren't big enough where you needed to have, like, skin cut off.  I will.  I will.  Oh, yeah?  You're going to have that cut off?  Yes.  If only Jame Gum was real, that would be free.  Yeah, just cut some diamonds into your back.  Make a nice skirt for somebody.  So I get down a well. 
[03:33:30]  Fall collection.  It doesn't look like you got skin hanging, though.  Oh, I do.  It's there.  It's pretty bad.  You look amazing.  Thank you so much.  Amazing.  Hundred and what?  Eighty pounds, I guess?  If I'm doing the math fast?  177-ish?  177-ish.  That's like losing a person.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, I got gastric bypass surgery last March.  Oh, you did?  It's been...  Thursday was a year.  How come that works so well for some people?  Thank you.  And other people, it doesn't fucking work.  They take half your stomach out, right?  Therapy.  They're like...  Therapy, therapy, therapy. 
[03:34:00]  They clamp it.  And trying to treat it...  You need the therapy on top of your stomach stapled.  Oh, yeah, like what made me go there.  What were you eating so much?  What was the...  What void were you filling the food?  What wasn't she eating?  Filling the God hole.  I think it was kind of the opposite of what you guys were talking about earlier.  You were talking about women with daddy issues.  Yeah.  I had the mom issues.  Uh-huh.  And so I think that's...  So mom issues...  Mom issue chicks eat food.  Dad issue chicks eat cock.  Exactly.  Right.  All right.  I vote for dad issue chicks. 
[03:34:30]  Catch my vote.  Yes.  Fast Freddy writes, tons of protein.  Good girl.  That old gag.  Now, I remember recently I saw you walk through FH Riles and before I knew it was you, I was  like, wow, that girl's hot.  And then I'm like, I know this...  And I couldn't believe it.  Like, are you getting hit on like crazy now?  And is that weird to you?  It's very, very, very weird.  I'm not used to being visible.  The bigger I was, the less...  The more people walked by me like I was a wall.  Right.  So I don't really know how to respond to it. 
[03:35:00]  Ah, so you've been like a slut then?  No, I'm still married.  That's your husband with you, right?  No, that's a friend.  Some guy?  No, that is.  You guys saw him on the slide, right?  That's good.  Who's that?  Elmo the Prank Caller from the BAB days.  Holy shit.  Didn't he...  You were in jail, bro.  No.  Oh, then I'm thinking somebody else.  Wow.  Elmo...  Wait.  Elmo the Prank Caller from BAB days?  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  What was your big prank call that I played? 
[03:35:30]  You've had him in studio.  Oh, did he call that as your refrigerator was running?  Yeah, hilarious.  Oh, shit, I remember you.  You used to have hair, dude.  What happened to your hair?  What?  I go bold and do the shave thing.  I remember, now that I see you close up, I'm fat.  I won't be able to get...  Why can't you get the surgery?  You don't need the surgery.  How much do you weigh?  $2.25.  So you lost, like, most of that guy.  Wow, that's fucked up right there.  Isn't that wild?  Isn't that wild?  Man. 
[03:36:00]  Is your husband loving it?  Oh, he's totally loving it.  Yeah?  Very, very much so.  Yeah.  He can find everything now.  Exactly.  Well, is the sex better?  It is, but I'm still really, really self-conscious.  Like, if I'm naked, it's hard to tell, because it kind of looks like I'm wearing a suede suit.  Holy shit, really?  That much hanging skin?  So when are you going to get it chopped off?  They said I have to wait two years, but I want kids, so I have to see what goes on with that.  Oh, my God.  You're going to get all skinny to fuck yourself up. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, but there won't be stretch marks from that.  Do you have the scar from the cut?  How do they do that?  The scars are tiny.  Oh, are they?  The scars are tiny.  It's aprescopic.  I thought when they did that surgery...  In the old days.  I thought they opened you from chest to belly button, and I...  It's called an autopsy.  What the fuck are you thinking?  I should have known that, shouldn't I?  I'm suing NBC.  Jim C., you should have known orthoscopic surgery...  You can't even say it right, can you?  Orthoscopic surgery.  They just put a little, like a needle-like thing in you. 
[03:37:00]  They work with little...  You get a little slit scar, and they work with little tubes and telescopes, little scopes  that they put in you, and before you know it, Anthony's talking so much, so the music  starts, but it never does.  No, it doesn't start.  He's looking for it.  Derek should be murdered.  He's a wispy-haired, Timothy Hutton-looking boy, Sam.  Smother than you when you're Asian buttocks. 
[03:37:30]  Unbelievable.  If I hear that music, I'm coming in there and punching you in the face.  That's right.  At this point now, if I even hear it, I swear I'm punching you.  Please play it.  I want to see Anthony get angry for once.  Once.  No.  In all these years.  I'm beloved.  Can I make a point?  Janine, do I hate the fans?  In person?  Yeah.  Absolutely, she was going to say.  Does he hate the fans, or does Greg Hughes the actor who plays the fans?  Ah.  I hate the fans.  It was brought up in an article that I hate the listeners.  I would never say that.  I'd say you definitely have a soul somewhere.  Oh, thank you.  Somewhere. 
[03:38:00]  And you show it occasionally.  The devil owns it.  He gives it back every once in a while.  No, but you're hot as hell, Janine, and it needs to be said that you're just terrific.  And if I may interject, I don't get to come on here very often.  I know you guys don't really like to work with the ladies, but Anthony, I wanted to tell  you, I think you should settle down a little bit.  I think you should stop going with the young girls and try going with somebody that's  for your age.  I think it would be good for you.  You know, the last thing I want to do is hang out with a fucking bitch in her 40s.  Oh, but who are you going to talk to in the morning? 
[03:38:30]  To sit there and yap and fucking just talk about fucking what?  Arthritis?  Shut up.  Give me girls in their late teens and early 20s.  Who's he going to talk to in the morning?  A fucking girl with a juicy ass who was born during the Clinton administration.  Exactly.  Somebody with a nice mind.  Fuck that's a first Bush administration.  A good head on his shoulders.  And I don't mean the father.  I didn't mean Bill.  I was assuming she was going to like it.  See, Janine's playing the part of the hole here.  You understand?  Yeah, I know.  I didn't even get that. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, guys.  She doesn't believe that.  Oh, Jimmy?  She doesn't believe that shit.  No.  She's happy for Anthony that he's banging everything.  Well, maybe he's banging everything in sight.  I don't really know.  I don't know.  Banging everything in sight.  I actually hate Anthony.  Remember?  I want to defend Anthony.  Yeah, we don't talk when I have friends.  Right.  Go ahead.  Don't worry.  We should talk about you.  We should talk about you.  Who cares?  Who are you again?  Well, James Wood said, if you're going to get a dog, are you going to get an old, weathered,  beaten dog?  Or are you going to get a puppy?  That's playful.  You know, you're going to get a puppy.  Sit back down.  Well said.  Well said. 
[03:39:30]  That's good.  He just saw him back there.  Why don't you do a prank call?  Right.  Maybe it works better on the phone.  He ran in there with that James Wood fucking gem.  Yeah.  It happens.  Yeah.  Imagine James Wood.  Nice try.  He has a big cock.  James Wood is a legendarily big cock.  Yes.  Always mention that.  That's probably the biggest cock in Hollywood now that Uncle Miltie's dead.  Willem Dafoe, who is we having coming in, allegedly has a very fucking large face.  First question.  First question.  How big's your cock?  That's right.  How many of us could work on it at the same time?  Get a little elbow.  Good for you, right? 
[03:40:00]  All right, Janine.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  So, are you done losing the weight?  Because you don't want to get to anorexic stage or anything like that.  It's supposed to kind of level off on its own, but if I'm going to try and do a pregnancy  thing, I'm going to see where that goes.  Oh, boy.  Did you have to lose the weight to possibly get pregnant?  I hear fatter women can't get...  It's dangerous to get pregnant, right?  I don't even think I was ovulating.  Really?  You were supposed to be a bunch of fat around your ovaries?  You'd eat the eggs when they came out and fry them up.  Not to mention, there wasn't much likelihood of pregnancy at that point either. 
[03:40:30]  I mean, I was miserable with myself.  My husband understood, and he wasn't, you know...  So, are you popping out eggs now?  I am.  The eggs are dropping?  I am.  By the time they hit the womb, they had bacon, cheese on them, on a roll.  How old are you?  That's awesome.  How old are you?  I'll be 36.  So, yeah, you've got to get on that before they turn into a mongoloid pod.  I'm going to be a little bit very short.  Very shortly.  Mongoloid pods.  Little dumbbell capsules.  Here's the other thing. 
[03:41:00]  You don't look 36.  Not anymore.  You didn't look 36 when you were big.  I've never seen this.  You're gushing.  I love this girl.  I hope he's gushing.  He's nicer to you, though, that he has been to 10 women in a row.  Holy shit.  Exactly.  We've had long conversations at FH Riley's about this.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  She's good people.  I was good people.  Now I'm down in person.  Nice.  You are a good person.  You know what?  Can we open a window?  Could you just take your clothes off and glide like a bat?  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:41:30]  You're hiding it well if you've got skin hanging because we can't see.  Oh, I have much, much skin.  Much skin.  I'm really trying to just tuck it all into the bra.  How do they remove that?  It's a knife.  It's a knife.  Well, no.  I thought it was a cheese grater.  No, but I mean, do they have to cut all over your body or do they fucking just squeeze  you and get into one area?  I think, no, they have to cut all around.  I think if they were going to go for a lower body lift, which would be the thighs and the  belly and probably the ass, it's almost an all-around incision.  Yeah.  Have you seen a butcher do a skirt steak? 
[03:42:00]  Oof.  Yeah.  It's sort of like, you know, they go all around, they take off the bum, they trim it.  It's interesting.  You look like an articulated Barbie doll when you're done.  Exactly.  It's just a little slit around the waist.  Here's a question.  The before and after pictures, have you seen it?  That other women, from other women that have had this done or whatever, does it look  all right?  It looks way better.  Way better.  It looks way better.  Anything is better.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  Yeah, so they just bunch it up in a knot on the back, cut the base of it, and then they  cap it.  Is that what you do now? 
[03:42:30]  Just pull it onto between your shoulder blades with a scrunchie?  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  Screw mine.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  And I'm the evil one.  No, you're being really nice.  I like her.  I don't know.  When Obi's nice, I have to be mean.  What the fuck is going on?  I don't know.  And look, you know the show well enough that when he said, you're good people, and you  said, well, actually, I'm a good person now, I almost went.  We love you.  Squirted out a few, did you, Jim? 
[03:43:00]  Did you?  Oh, the hole gets one.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys.  Let's just be nice.  Yeah, come on now, guys.  Get lost.  We're not going to do this all day.  That's it.  You got your compliment.  Now sit back down, will you?  It doesn't even feel real.  You like her too much to be mean.  I do like her.  Try not to step on your calves.  You dragging skin.  Hey, by the way, can I make a comment?  It's kind of not what we were talking about, 
[03:43:30]  but Lily has the fucking latest hat in the collection.  Does she?  Oh, yeah.  Lily got a brand new little hat.  She got it in New Orleans, I believe.  She went to New Orleans, and she wasn't raped there,  which is amazing for a white girl to go down to New Orleans  and not be sexually assaulted.  She can thank Brad and Angelina for that.  Oh, really?  Are they single-handedly cleaning up in New Orleans?  Absolutely, they are.  Great.  Here comes our big co-star from the pilot. 
[03:44:00]  Hello.  Hi, Lily.  Hi, Lily.  Looking very fashionable today.  You know how to fucking wear a hat, huh?  I sure do.  That's a nice hat.  Can you come closer?  That's a nice hat.  Is that good?  Yeah.  She's such a smart ass.  Are you scared of Marc Maron?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah.  He's got long hair and glasses.  What's wrong with that?  Serial killer.  Oh, okay.  Not Jim?  The guy with long hair and glasses?  Oh, Jim's a sweetheart.  Well, you just know him, that's all.  I'm a good boy.  That is true.  Are you really scared of Marc?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm not scared. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not scared of men.  Hold on.  Now I'm all men.  See?  No, he wants to look at it.  I wanted to see if the colors were the Wii, but they are.  They're two different colors from two different strands of straw.  He wants to look at your eyes, actually.  How does she look so good in that hat?  That's a hat that a Negro over 80 should be wearing.  And she looks like to me with a fucking band Joe and a sad song on his heart.  But wait, isn't that all hats other than baseball hats?  It's true.  Damn, he's right.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to wear a derby hole.  With the exception of a certain cap with a tassel.  Lily. 
[03:45:00]  I'm going to tassel or a pointy white one.  Lily?  Yes.  Ron and Fez noon to three.  Let's not forget that.  I've been away.  I forgot how it works.  Ron and Fez noon to three.  Sorry.  Yeah.  How was your trip?  Was it good?  It was good.  It was good when I stayed in the white area, I have to be honest.  Oh, did you stray?  A little bit.  And then I just went right back to my ritzy hotel.  Why did you stray?  You were in search of black cock?  Shopping.  Black cock?  The hat.  I had to buy a hat.  I had to buy a hat. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, they don't sell that in the white areas.  They sell like Mardi Gras stuff.  Whatever you do, don't make a left and don't make a right.  Just stay on the street.  Wow.  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  Congratulations on your religion.  The number one religion in the world now.  Oh.  Oh, you're a Muslim, yeah.  Muslim is the number one religion in the world.  You believe she's a fucking Muslim?  Yes.  How does that fucking even figure?  Because I saw her playing with marbles.  I'm like, what are you doing?  She got just my clit.  Jesus.  You know if she can handle it?  You know what I'm saying?  I got to go do, like in a half hour, I got to go do my progressive video cast show. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, right.  Yes.  This is a good training.  Yeah, yeah.  Now I got to go to the other side.  Get a warm up for that.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a show.  Somebody next time better fucking hire Lily.  I'm just saying.  Thank you.  Oh, I got other plans for Lily.  No, I don't agree with them.  I'm secretly breaking down the Ron and Fez show piece by piece.  And I got plans for Lily.  Lily cannot leave.  She will be leaving.  I heard about Lily's plans.  She shouldn't be.  She will be leaving, my friends.  Lily's got her heart set on the fucking, not even in radio, it's on the tube. 
[03:46:30]  Lily wants to be on the tube.  She should be on television, right?  Yeah.  Eventually, sure.  Eventually.  Yeah.  But I got to chase that dollar first, because I'm getting nothing here.  Get married.  Thanks, Earl.  Earl.  Getting nothing.  Married?  Ew.  No.  Ask his ex-wife how much money she has made.  Eh, well.  Yeah, how is fucking XM not giving Lily any money?  Um, because they don't pay the staff under a certain level.  Would you come on as an intern? 
[03:47:00]  I am an intern.  Oh, wait, that's right.  You don't get paid in your work.  You don't get paid?  I'm like a super, super intern, I guess.  Super intern.  I don't even know what it means.  Wait a minute.  You don't get a dollar?  Not for this fucking show.  I mean, well, that show.  Or this fucking show.  You're right.  Or this one.  For side things, but that's just companies.  Well, how does that work?  You add a lot to that radio show.  Thank you.  I think so.  I do.  All right, we got room on our show.  We could pay you a few bucks.  I think you should fire, um...  You could fire two people and combine their salary.  Okay, I'd say I'd fire Steve. 
[03:47:30]  Steve's gone.  And then I would fire Travis, because he just smokes.  Travis, yeah.  She's, uh, she's horrible.  I love him, though.  Her.  Well, you can like him if you want, but you want to see him fucking voted.  Than, you made the cut.  Congrats.  Oh, no.  I gave her mind.  I forgot.  I want Than out.  Oh, shit.  Sorry, Than.  Because I want to sit there.  Oh.  Yeah.  We want you to sit there.  The left hand of Opie.  We want you to sit there.  It was one date, and that's it. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, right.  They did kind of go out or some shit.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Whatever kind of a fucking love connection thing that was.  Did you try to have sex with her?  No.  Of course he did.  Tried.  Tried.  Jeez.  You could try.  What are you talking to?  Oh, sorry, Than.  I'm going the other way with that hand.  Oh, okay.  I was going to go, of course he tried.  Yeah.  I'm dying to know.  Fucking Than, I suspect, is all cock.  It really bothers me.  Let me tell you something.  Well, Lily, you best be all cock.  She's a size queen.  I like them on the larger size.  I'm not even going to lie. 
[03:48:30]  That fucking.  And any girl who says that she does it is a fucking liar.  Because if you had a choice between a bigger cock or a smaller cock, you're going to choose  the bigger one.  And the fucking photo she saw of my cock from the wedding was me in the urinal with Keith  the cop.  We were giggling.  It looks like a baby dick.  Oh, you couldn't even pump it up.  It was flaccid.  I mean, you know.  Oh, yes.  It was flaccid.  What's the cutoff?  12, 13?  Oh, I think like more than, you know, 10, 11.  What about width?  What about girth?  Isn't girth important? 
[03:49:00]  That was the low side I'm talking.  Where do you start?  Oh, I like 8, 9 is good.  I think 9 is perfect.  Fat?  Yeah, I'm not too fat.  Right.  9 is perfect.  Move to fucking Africa.  Exactly.  Well, she went down to New Orleans.  She's, you know.  No, I don't mess with black guys.  She's in search.  Why?  What's wrong with the black guys?  You're black.  I'm just not attracted to black men.  How are they not paying for this radio gold of yours?  What the hell's wrong with them over there?  She's trying to have a...  Oh, fuck.  What, God? 
[03:49:30]  You got it.  Yeah.  She's tired of having to change her pin number after sex.  Come on.  Funny.  That was great.  I didn't fuck it up so much.  I was rooting for a bomb and it was a gem.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I can't deny it.  That was a fucking good one.  All right.  We can look at you all day long, but we got to get out of here.  Okay.  We're going to do line of the day.  Lily from...  Say hi to...  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Noona 3.  Say hi to Ron and Fez.  I will.  I adore those gentlemen.  I have a fantastic scarf and a dazzling hat.  How's Eastside Dave's haircut?  I haven't seen him in a week and a half, so... 
[03:50:00]  He looks ridiculous.  I only saw pictures.  Oh, it looks silly.  Well, he's, you know, not so attractive as it is.  And he's retarded.  But I'm sure he looks less attractive.  What position do you want on this program?  Executive producer.  Really?  I got to aim for the top.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Interesting.  Yeah.  I got to cut out.  Ron and Fez.  Oh, you got to head out?  Yeah, I got to cut out.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Lily.  Bye, Lily.  Mark.  Yeah, Mark's got to leave.  We're hanging out.  Yeah, no, we can't hang out.  I've got to go do my progressive video show now.  What happened?  Yeah.  No, I'm having a great time. 
[03:50:30]  We're sitting here on a good time, and you want to leave on us.  Oh, see, now I'm an asshole for hanging out for nine hours.  I've been here since yesterday.  I'm the douchebag.  What happened?  I thought we were all having fun.  That reminds me of this thing.  Oh, God.  When did it become not fun for you?  You know the comedian Tom Rhodes?  You know Tom Rhodes?  Yeah, sure.  One time we were in L.A.  This was years ago.  And it was me and my buddy Jack.  And Tom was at a comedy club.  And I said to Tom, you want to come back to the hotel?  We're going to have a couple of beers, smoke some pot.  This was back when I did that shit.  So he comes over, and we ended up, like, the three of us just hanging out and partying 
[03:51:00]  all night.  The sun was coming up.  And I'm like, you know, I think I'm going to crash.  And Tom literally stands up and goes, I thought we were hanging out.  I thought you said we were having a couple of beers.  What the fuck?  That happens to all of us.  It's so amazing.  In 12 hours.  I got to go do a thing.  I really appreciate you guys having me.  All right.  Mark Maron, Giggles, Seattle, this weekend.  The last CD you're going to be recording before who knows what you do to yourself.  Take care, fellas.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Here goes.  He's busy.  Always good to see you.  Busy man. 
[03:51:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  What's wrong?  No, all is well, actually.  But I wanted to plug a gig I have coming up.  You can't, Jimmy.  Oh, help Jimmy out.  No, he can't.  I'm turning his mic off.  It's something.  Wow, Jimmy.  It's for all of us.  Jimmy.  The 12th of April.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Detroit.  Clutch Cargo.  Michigan.  Yeah, I'm finally coming to do a stand-up show.  My first one, aside from Traveling Virus, in Detroit.  We have a huge XM audience in that area.  I hope so, man.  We did great with the Traveling Virus, and we were barely on that FM at the time. 
[03:52:00]  I also got Caroline's this month, too.  I heard.  I saw the big promotion when I was there.  Oh, is there a promo there?  Well, a lot of people say, hey, I'm going to go see you, and I never see the comedian,  which isn't true.  I went and saw Mike Birbiglia over the weekend.  He was great.  Yeah, he's really funny.  Absolutely.  17 through 20 this month.  I'm at Caroline's here in New York.  That's it.  Okay.  We didn't look back at our April Fool's prank.  No, good thing, I think.  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Some things are best left unsolved.  I just like when they got us in the hallway, though.  Hillary Clinton has conceded defeat.  No.  April Fool's.  You got me.  Oh, my God.  We got one in right at the end there.  Very good.  Oh, wow.  We should have known about it, because then we could have ran with it and gotten in trouble.  Yeah.  Had partial landing gear failure.  USA Airways plane.  Oh, sorry.  Now we're just reading the news.  All right.  How about you read that right there? 
[03:53:00]  Enamel paint found on components of landing gear parts.  You can't have enamel paint on those.  Everyone knows that.  Yes.  What, they're crazy?  Child left in car.  Car towed away with baby inside.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, look at the little thing.  All right.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Let's just be quiet.  A man with not a baseball cap.

Assless Chats Weekly.  I don't know why I bother even coming up to a microphone.  Black Inches. 
[03:54:00]  With that, fuck you, Rick.  You ungrateful fuck.  Another smart girl moved by you.  You dummy.  Bridge burner.  I think I add something to the show.  A little bit.  No.  You add a lot of plugs.  You fuck me up.  Yeah.  That's what Rick says.  I don't interrupt you.  Look, you just did.  I'm not done.  That's good acting by me.  And me.  Thank you.

How do you know?  He was always inflicting the wrong moments.  Oh, it's so bad.  Could we please?  Is it that bad?  Oh, he's got to go home.  I just want to hear some.  I got The Wire to watch.  I'm almost done.  I want to just hear a little horrid Voss actor.  Black Beans. 
[03:55:00]  Louis Beans.  The guy who knows.  He fucking stinks on ice.  He's so bad.  I got through four episodes of The Wire yesterday.  I want to do another four.  Wow, you hooked.  What season are you?  You're right.  I'm halfway done with four.  You're in four already?  Yeah, I'm rocking, dude.  So you've seen Tristan already?  You know who he is?  The fucking kid with the hat?  Yeah, oh yeah.  And Chris, the assassin?  Oh, yeah.  Did you meet the stepfather yet?  No.  Okay, no big deal.  I remember you guys talking about that, so I'm trying to figure out when that's going  to come into play. 
[03:55:30]  I don't know yet.  Oh, in three.  You're in season four already.  Wow.  I ain't out of here, son of this.  I ain't fucking around.  Oh, stupid rich.  All right.  A bronchish tale.  A bronchish tale.  You know, it's not fair, though, because...  Oh, it's fair.  It really isn't.  Fuck him up his Jewish ass.  I got a soft side today, because I don't want the whole world to hate me.  Yeah, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Because I don't want the whole world to hate me.  I don't like this Opie.  We don't hate you.  You're so fucking...  Let's make...  Dice hates me.  John Minnelli hates me.  Ben hates me.  Rick hates me. 
[03:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  Is that it?  Um...  You do hate me.  I forgot answers.  I was raising my hand.  That means we got to fight again.  But, you know, because, well, Rick's not here to break up the fist.  I think Jay Moore doesn't like me, but he doesn't want to really go down that road for whatever  Really?  Yeah, I have a feeling.  He doesn't really like talking to me when he calls the show.  One thing you could always depend on is the love of E-Rock, though.  Which is nice.  Yeah.  E-Rock's got resentment.  All right, let's make the list.  Dicey.  Let's make the list who likes me.  Do you like me?  Some days more than others, but that's mutual. 
[03:56:30]  At least we both know that.  Jesus.  You know how you were talking about marriage earlier?  Oh, jeez.  Do you think we're in some kind of marriage situation at this point?  Let's stay together for the children.  And by that, I mean Benjamin Franklin.  Let's see.  Who else?  Jimmy, do you like me?  Define like. 
[03:57:00]  Holy choke up on the bat for that one.  Yes, you did.  He was waiting.  Please ask me.  Jimmy's sitting there going, please ask me.  Please say like, too, so I can get the line out right.  Please don't say, hey, Jimmy, do you?  Because then I'd have to go, do I what?  It'll be too forced.  Of course I do.  I know Tracy, the old PD at K-Rock, hates my guts.  I think Jeremy doesn't really like me anymore.  Jeremy, I think, likes you more than likes me.  A lot of radio guys hate me.  From radio.  What about the rest of the staff? 
[03:57:30]  Than.  Than tolerates me, it's obvious.  Tolerates?  Yeah.  E-Rock likes me.  E-Rock adores you.  E-Rock looks up to you, but he really has a fucking bag of rocks.  You're like an abusive father to E-Rock.  Like, he loves you because he has to, because you're his father, but you beat him down.  I'm one of his heroes.  And he resents you for that.  E-Rock!  Where are we at?  I've been a lot nicer to E-Rock lately.  Now he'll lie and say yes.  I took him out to a really nice steak dinner.  E-Rock, where are we at with our relationship?  What would you think? 
[03:58:00]  Because I don't need any more hate articles coming out anytime soon.  I don't hate you.  Where are we at, though?  I don't hate you.  You think I'm nicer to you these days?  Except for the fat jokes that I can't help?  Nicer.  Oh my god, he's thinking.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  It's civil.  Oh, wow.  And this is from like, dude, this is from your number one supporter on the staff.  Oh my god.  Oh, the guy you personally brought in?  Hey, you want to fucking get E-Rock?  Just take him out for a lard martini. 
[03:58:30]  Fucking.  Oh, here comes the article.  The hate article in Weight Watchers magazine.  That's something.  Come on, E.  Didn't we have fun for your birthday at Sparks Steakhouse there with the secret guest that  everyone's still trying to guess who it was?  Yes, it was very nice.  It was very nice?  Very nice.  Yeah.  E-Rock had a great time.  He wanted it to end like that.  Fucking you laying on the street with a cigar in your mouth.  Sam, what about you?  Do you like me?  Sam? 
[03:59:00]  I love Opie.  Oh.  Aw.  That was just a...  Wow.  That was just a cliche.  There was no sincerity in the answer.  None.  I love Opie.  Exactly.  I think the next one to hate me is going to be Steve.  Steve?  Yeah.  That's going to hate you?  Hold on.  Wait.  That would imply he doesn't already.  Steve has a really weird relationship with Opie.  Steve wants to hate Opie, but yet every time he walks by the mirror, the little voice  goes, he's right.  You are an incompetent. 
[03:59:30]  Wait.  Hold on.  Oh, shit.  What does the little voice say?  It says...  Say it right to...  Yeah.  Say it to my face.  Steroid head.  Look at the size of Steve.  He's a big boy.  He has big biceps.  All right.  Steve...  Okay.  So I caught a little bit of this.  I was...  Do you like me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually do.  There are times I don't...  It's like...  You know something?  Yeah.  Fuck me.  I do.  Yeah.  I actually fucking do.  Yeah.  I don't...  I don't know why, but... 
[04:00:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was like saying, you ever suck a horse cock and enjoy it?  Funny as shit.  I do.  There was this one song.  Funny as shit.  You should mention it.  Funny as shit.  You should actually use that analogy.  Yes.  Exactly.  Sometimes it's just...  It's just the taste.  It's a little bit sweet.  Why the fuck do I run with this every fucking time?  Steve.  Why do you think...  M for M.  And I Google...  I quote horse hog.  Steve's actually a pretty smart...  Steve's a pretty smart guy.  Yes.  I'm going to ask a very serious question now.  Okay. 
[04:00:30]  And then these guys will like goof on.  But that's all right.  And then they'll call me queer again.  Why...  Why is it that people help a lot in their careers?  And I'm not even going to name names.  I have a...  I actually have a...  Why do they end up hating you?  Because of...  Wait.  Why do they end up hating you?  That was almost funny.  I think the tendency...  I think this business attracts a lot of misfits.  Addicts.  People with personality defects.  Addicts are drawn to drama. 
[04:01:00]  People with the personality defect that it would take...  And the insecurity...  The insecurity that it would take to be drawn to this business...  Oh, this has been working very well.  Yes, absolutely.  No, I like this.  I really do.  This is absolutely true.  Dr. Z.  Hold on a second.  No, this is going to work great.  I think that those people tend not to take responsibility for their own actions.  So they will fuck up and try to blame the nearest target.  And...  Well, if you're obviously...  Why is he always getting blamed?  Ah.  Right.  Sometimes a lot of people that come into this situation have daddy issues. 
[04:01:30]  And since you're the guy that brought him in...  They look at you as this nurturer.  And you're the easiest target to accuse of why something didn't work out.  So, you know, these flawed personalities are looking for targets.  And you're the easiest one.  Because you're the guy who's benefiting from all the hard work that this staff puts in.  No.  That's absolutely...  Hold on.  I like...  Wow.  I think I sort of make jokes, but I like this answer a lot. 
[04:02:00]  Of course you do.  Because the alternative is, you're an asshole.  Exactly.  No, because...  Because it's bizarre to me that...  If people only knew...  I only scratched the surface today.  Of what I did for Rick in his personal life and his fucking career.  And for him to turn around and write that...  And do that interview.  It just...  It just amazes me that someone could stoop that low.  I'm not saying you're not unreasonable and don't make lunatic a completely fucking bizarre request sometimes. 
[04:02:30]  Well...  Because you do.  Bye-bye, Steve.  You honestly think I give a rat's fat fucking ass?  Whoa!  He told you!  Nice!  He told you!  Wow!  I don't know how things are going.  Apparently you haven't.  Oh, shit.  Swim off.  Oh, swim off.  I don't have to fight Anthony today.  He's going to get his beating from Steve.  I know.  Where's Rick?  Help me.  Get in the way of the fists.  Here's the thing with Ope.  I'll tell you this briefly.  Ope can be very difficult.  Because you said you're from two different vibes. 
[04:03:00]  But there's also a very sweet and giving side.  What bugs me about when Ben left is that...  That must be the side Lindsay sees.  She's actually...  Ah, whatever.  It's going to get too mushy.  It's going to get too mushy.  But she has definitely balanced out those two sides nicely for me.  She's made me see a lot of things in myself.  Ben got very angry.  But what Ben didn't see, and this is the truth, and I watched you do it,  was like, there was a couple times where Elo wanted to get rid of Ben, 
[04:03:30]  and I...  Oh, he was fired.  But I remember being in the car in California,  and you saving his job.  And I'm not saying that...  More than once, my friend.  You and him couldn't have issues.  More than once.  At least three times.  There are things that people don't see.  Like, that was something that I would like to sit down with Ben and go,  you really...  Honest to God, dude, he really did go to bat for you with Logan.  Many times.  I watched it happen.  Yeah.  Logan wanted him gone way before he was let go.  The last time, when he was finally let go,  it was Logan that just said, 
[04:04:00]  no, he's gone, and there's no saving him this time.  Yeah, there were at least three times.  At least.  Where he was...  And it wasn't he was going to be fired.  There was a discussion about...  He was fired.  Logan said, he's gone.  He's fired.  And then it took, you know, sitting down and going,  look, this is the way it is.  And Rick, the thing that bugs me about Rick,  it's not even that, like,  ah, you don't like me on this, that's fine.  But it's like, I saw him in San Francisco.  This is what phony people are.  And me, him, and Kenny went out.  We sat down, and we had lunch.  And it's like...  San Francisco, huh? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, it was really...  It was nice.  We had a nice lunch.  Excused ourselves from Kenny.  And I couldn't go anywhere with that.  Ant doesn't like getting serious.  He gets a little awkward.  No, Ant can be.  Yeah, you get a little awkward.  Ant tends, by the way, Ant thrives.  I was going to say this before we forgot.  But women, you like high drama.  And it comes from a violent background.  I do?  You do.  You like...  Ant likes having to do this.  Is this our group therapy session?  Is this serious?  Anthony likes having to do this.  Man, hold me.  Anthony likes having to do this.  It's okay, honey.  It's cool.  It's cool. 
[04:05:00]  It's cool.  Anthony likes to kind of like...  You're a caretaker.  Yes, even though you probably hate it.  You're a caretaker.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I don't like that at all.  I'm not...  I hate drama.  Well, of course you do.  Yes, you do.  You absolutely hate drama.  But look at your first wife.  Why am I in it?  Why was your first wife so...  No, you're on the outside of it.  I need drugs.  You avoid all this, which is fine.  No, Anthony, I'm telling you.  That's why this whole thing works well.  It's working out childhood crisis.  But getting back to Jimmy, yeah, you sat with Rick and none of this came out when he had  the chance to say it to your face. 
[04:05:30]  Or even...  I understand why he wouldn't say that to me, but not even a word about you.  Like, just chit-chatting, general nonsense.  We went to lunch.  We had a nice day.  And it's almost like, dude, to be...  Like, I wouldn't personally...  I mean, I would have been friendly if I saw someone, but I think we talked and actually  arranged to meet.  Kenny might remember more than me.  Kenny left.  He left.  Why would he stay when you need him?  I have things to do.  Well, and the same thing with Aunt and I and Rick.  We were on the sidewalk less than four or five months ago. 
[04:06:00]  I don't even know.  Yeah.  Because it was one of just...  We left...  We bumped into him.  He was going up for a job.  We talked and...  He could have said whatever he wanted to my face.  I was right there in front of him.  Yeah, man.  And it's just...  It's like, come on.  What are you doing, dude?  Just to get yourself on the cover of Steppin' Out?  Steppin' Out, my friend.  Why?  Wow.  Why?  Chauncey Hayden's rag.  I like Steve's...  I like...  That was very interesting, Steve.  Thank you.  And that has been told to me by other people in the know.  So it was very interesting.  It seems like someone's been... 
[04:06:30]  Ah, it's 17 years of therapy, my friend.  Really?  You've been going for 17 years?  But since I was still...  It's fucked up.  And I'm still completely fucked up.  That really throws therapy out the window.  What does that therapist do?  See, that was a...  Fucking hit you and call you.  See, that was a...  Fuck you.  Call you worthless.  Let me point out something.  That was a...  Time for therapy.  Where's my KY?  That was a chance for Anthony to be a little serious, but he got a little uncomfortable,  so he went right for the joke.  That's what it does.  I did.  We're going to be talking about each other.  I did.  You want Anthony to be serious?  Yeah.  Look at them fucking hitting that white girl. 
[04:07:00]  They fucking just...  It's very easy to get Anthony to be serious.  Let's say hi to Jason.  Just mention one of them in his name.  Reason?  Jason and Carolina.  You see me get serious.  Jason and Carolina, what's up?  Hey, boys.  I just called that douche station.  I don't even know who they are.  Oh, W-E-E-I, yes.  Big war started today.  They're fighting back.  I asked if Bopey was there.  They put me on.  He said, hang on.  Somebody got on.  Claimed he was Jim Norton.  Started asking me where I went to school, and then it insinuated that I was just ignorant 
[04:07:30]  and stupid and uneducated, but he entertained my phone call for quite some time.  Good.  Pop this up.  Pop this up real fast.  It's fun the first couple of times when C-bombs start getting dropped on the air, they  won't.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's attack hard.  Yeah, they think it's fun now.  It's always the same beginning, middle, and end to these things.  At first, it's like, oh, this is funny, and then it's like, uh-oh, and then, oh, my  God, we can't do a show.  Fucking jealous scumbags in Boston, acting like they didn't know who you were, just fucking 
[04:08:00]  jealous AM scumbags.  We're going to escalate this thing.  What's the number again?  Starting tomorrow.  I don't know the number offhand.  We should have wrote it down somewhere.  Attack.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  I appreciate it.  Attack.  All right.  Where were we?  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you.  I was going serious there, and Ant tried to derail it because he was uncomfortable with  serious.  The comic genius that Rick said you were?  Yes, yes.  You know what?  There's another...  That's me.  You know, to wrap up the whole list of... 
[04:08:30]  Not the whole.  There's more, I know.  But a list of people that hate me.  Why does Dice hate me?  I don't think Dice hates you, to be very honest with you.  I really don't.  What was that about?  I don't know.  Maybe because he was going on Howard, or maybe he felt like you blew him off.  I honestly don't know.  I talked to him in LA.  I saw him a year ago.  Yeah.  So I just don't know.  I mean, he didn't shit on you.  The only thing I can think of is he wanted to talk to me personally before we started  doing our show again. 
[04:09:00]  And I didn't want to talk to anybody.  Like, when we got back to XM, you know, I just wasn't into socializing with anybody.  I barely wanted to do radio.  When my dad, you know, died, I can't even explain what that did to me on so many levels.  And so I blew off everybody.  I still have a list of phone calls I still got to make.  And that's the only thing I can think of is the fact that I didn't call him back.  But I explained myself about that.  I'm like, look, you know, I wasn't talking to anybody. 
[04:09:30]  I honestly don't know.  But I don't think he hates you.  But I mean, I don't think he hates you, man.  The first year back on XM was not fun for me.  I only started having fun about a year into it.  And that's the truth.  Because recently I joked, oh, it's fun to do radio again.  But seriously, the first year, I barely remember what we did.  I was so not into it.  I was so depressed.  So depressed.  Way past that now.  But that's the only thing I could think of with the dice thing.  Yeah, I don't think it's real hate.  The dice thing! 
[04:10:00]  See, it was getting too serious.  See, he has to jump in.  Sorry, I gotta fuck it all up.  You hear?  I hear.  I like you, Opie.  I'm just wondering.  Kiss me.  Because I'm sure all the people...  Kiss me.  All right.  Put your lips from over there or to over here.  I shouldn't interrupt that.  Yeah, see, I'm sorry.  All right.  Where are we at? 
[04:10:30]  Oh, W-E-E-I.  Take serious.  Uh, we want around-the-clock calls to 888-525-0850.  And if you're...  If you have a Verizon phone, what is it for a free call?  I forgot.  Pound...  I want to say pound W-E-E-I.  E-E-I, I believe, yeah.  What are their names?  He's fucking...  Denison Callahan.  Denison, you fucking...  Oh, let's...  You over-the-hill jizzbags.  Let's expand our war immediately.  Uh, their main number is 617-779-3500. 
[04:11:00]  Their talk line is 617-779-0850.  And the number we've been giving out, uh, 888-525-W-E-E-I, right?  Yeah, all those numbers, if Paltalk could scroll them and entertain each other as you do.  Yeah.  What about their on-air studio fax number?  Mmm, fax.  Get them where it hurts.  They're doing fax.  Fax.  How about their mailing in their P.O. box?  Nothing?  You want their email address?  I mean, their regular mail address?  No.  Snail mail? 
[04:11:30]  Yeah.  Nah, we'll see where we take this battle tomorrow.  What's their postal code?  Let's, uh, let's do another runner-up line of the day.  We didn't mean to not have your back.  What?  Sorry, I'm just wrecking the show.  Go.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I know.  In an attempt...  No one had my back for waxing.  That's right.  Exactly.  They had my back, but they wouldn't put their chin in it like I like.  Exactly.  Where do I even bother?  Oh, yes.  Ed Asner.  Ed Asner is on the list of people that hate me.  Oh, wow.  He did call me the destroyer. 
[04:12:00]  All right.  Uh, is that it?  Line of the day?  Runner-up?  One more?  What?  Okay.  Another runner-up line of the day.  You know what I mean?  That's what people do.  You know, when you get left, you can't hurt them, so you gotta go out and have sex with  people they know.  Sure.  Right?  Didn't you do that?  Uh, apparently, yeah.  I kind of believe what Corey's about to say.  Corey and Philly, yes.  Yeah, what's up, Opie?  First off, I like you.  Thank you, sir.  Aw.  And I think Dice might not like you, because you kind of took Jimmy and Kenny from him. 
[04:12:30]  I have a feeling, maybe not as much Jimmy, because Jimmy was already on his way when  we were all friends, but I do have a feeling that it has something to do with Kenny.  I really do.  Yep.  I really do.  We helped Kenny when he needed help, and you can't fault us for that.  Punching out.  Thank you.  I do believe that that might have something to do with it.  That's me talking.  Not Kenny or anybody else.  But I think it has something to do with that as well.  It very well might, dude.  That's not a bad point. 
[04:13:00]  BodogFantasySports.net.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  It does it.  The line of the day.  Is it?  So are you popping out eggs now?  The eggs are dropping?  I am.  By the time they hit the womb, they had bacon, cheese on them, on a roll.  How old are you?  That's awesome. 
[04:13:30]  How old are you?  I'll be 36.  So yeah, you've got to get on that before they turn into little mongoloid pods.  Very short.  Very short.  Mongoloid pods.  And that's how you executive produce.  That's right.  Also, they have kind of an FU line, this WEEI.  They call it the whiner line.  Ew.  617.  779.  779.  Thank you, Than.  3535.  Is that what you got?  Yep.  Now wait until these shitheads, here's what they'll do, they'll have their phony empowerment,  like, yeah, this is fun, and then when the other shows start getting called, and they're 
[04:14:00]  getting all these messages, they're going to go, all right, enough is enough.  Yes, yeah, we can't have this.  And then we'll get the phone call, we won't stop it, and they will have to deal with the  pest.  Good luck to you.  Oh, by the way, I didn't forget.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  Ah, we can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son. 
[04:14:30]  And Rich Voss.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  Up on.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about, what are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans, this guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees me,  he keeps dying to me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian, stammering his way through a few lines of film  dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor. 
[04:15:00]  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx tale.  I don't know the right answer all the time, Johnny.  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something. 
[04:15:30]  Oh, God.  It gets funnier, right?  I could listen to that 800 times.  It gets funnier the more you listen to it.  Beans.  Beans.  But no emotion.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  You're always right.  No emotion, nothing.  The fucking L-I-R-R announcer has more fucking emotion.  You're right, Beans.  Beans.  Oy, Beans.  Loy, Beans.  Next stop, Loy, Beans.  Mineola.  Mineola. 
[04:16:00]  Getting a thumbs up from Mert Snort on that one, by the way.  Thank you, Mert.  Mert Snort.  All right.  What do you say we get the fuck out of here?  I hope Mert Snort gets fucking cancer of the septum and fucking his nose rolls off.  Leave him alone, Jimmy.  Leave him alone.  I'm going to fuck Mert right in the mouth.  Leave him alone, Jimmy.  Interesting to see nice Opie today.  I don't like it.  Well, it is April Fool's day.  Nice Opie.  I don't like it.  Oh, okay.  Say what I did.  All right.  You did an April Fool's on everybody.  You were nice. 
[04:16:30]  Excuse me.  We're still broadcasting.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  There's radio gold happening in here.  Did anyone see the on-air light?  Radio gold happening.  We got an on-air light?  Lots of them.  How about that?  We have lots of them.  Someone stole Tippi the Turtle's hat, and she's chit-chatting.  Tippi the Turtle.  God damn it.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, that's good. 
[04:17:00]  Rick is right.  You're ruining this show, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm Tippi the Turtle's hat.  I'm spurling it.  Oh, that's great.  You're a spurler of good things.  And she's the only one that can wear that sexy fucking rope scarf.  Honest to God, it looks like a noose.  She has a fucking noose scarf on.  She's just very fashionable.  She can be very fashionable in whatever little ensemble she puts together.  We speak, of course, of Miss Lily.  Miss Lily.  Hey, it's not Bert Snort.  No.  This Mert Snort is going to take on a life of its own. 
[04:17:30]  Is it?  Get it right.  M-E-R-T-S-N-O-R-T.  Mert Snort.  Mert Snort.  Mert Snort.  Mert Snort.  Eight seconds?  Minutes.  Oh.  What happened?  Take that hope out of your voice.  What happened?  I was going to say eight seconds?  We gave these motherfuckers extra bonus show.  Of course, the great...  They could pound it up their asses.  The Ron and Fez and Dave and Lily show?  Yes.  We like to call it the Ron and Fez disaster.  Yes.  We'll be happening from noon to three. 
[04:18:00]  Barely holding on at this point.  Ronnie's a magician.  Keeping that damn thing going with all the hell that's breaking loose around him.  That's right.  Look at your cards.  Chase the spades.  Ah.  Remember, just in case you need some ammunition.  This was said about us in Boston today.  So we're out of time.  We can't do our top ten April Fool's jokes?  Quickly.  Of all time?  The mayor's dead.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  No, the mayor's alive, kicking.  He's happy, healthy. 
[04:18:30]  Out riding his bike every morning at 5 a.m.  I'm not going to give you ten.  I'm going to give you like three or four out of the top ten April Fool's hostess of all time.  Whatever happened to those idiots that said the mayor was dead?  They were gone.  They were like working at that McDonald's with the child molester.  They're going to wish they never said that, by the way.  I think this one is going to be an epic war.  What happened to those idiots?  You really don't know?  You fucking dishonest nobodies.  You fucking nobodies.  What happened to them?  Did they end up in the number one market country? 
[04:19:00]  I don't know.  What the fuck happened to them?  Are they syndicated on a regular radio and the top channel on XM?  I'm not sure.  Where are they?  Where did they go?  We're on a fucking AM station here in Boston.  But where did they go?  Where are those guys?  Yeah.  I haven't heard much of them.  That's right.  I hope you didn't say that going through a tunnel.  No one would have heard you.  Static-y AM piece of shit.  You're doing AM joke?  I did an amplitude modulation joke, my friend.  We've got to go home if you're doing AM fucking jokes at this point. 
[04:19:30]  They're on W-  What the fuck's wrong with you?  W-E-E-I.  It's the Jealous Faggot and Ass Cave show.  They fucking both get prostate cancer.  Fuck them.  Fucking nobodies.  Ah, let's see.  It's going to be a season.  I think we did a good job today.  I think it was a bang-up show.  I know a lot of people are listening very closely today to see if we actually hated each other.  And we played it over the top, making sure people know that we like each other.  Yeah, I think there was a little tension there that people saw, but knew it was easily diffused. 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  It was joking.  A lot of fun.  Because everyone behaved today, I don't know why I'm doing this.  What are you playing?  Oh, no.  Just something that'll keep something going here.  So there you go.  One of the tracks from Unusual Suspects, the WAF CD, which is in your record store as we speak, man.  I wanted to see the recluse.  Yeah, we'll play more tracks from this baby as the afternoon goes on. 
[04:20:30]  Do you know, I have that feeling in my mouth like I just ate something sour, like you're  chewing on steroids.  I got a feeling like you ever go over a real steep hill in a car, and then you get that  like feeling in your stomach.  That's what that gave me.  Yeah, I do too. 
[04:21:00]  But it's a Thelma and Louise type of fucking plummet.  My favorite part is man.  I just threw a man in there.  You say man.  This is Andrew's man.  Man.  And we're going to be playing this baby.  It's like, who is this?  This is the character.  Yeah, Hendry.  Now, you should give it one more quick play that people will look out for the man.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to hear the man.  By the way, this is from Kevin in Connecticut sent this in.  He has an old tape of us.  You want me to replay, Jimmy?  Man.  Just one more time.  All right, one more time. 
[04:21:30]  Sure, no problem.  All right.  All right.  Oh.  Well.  You rock.  Get the tape.  Get the tape, you rock.  I don't think you'll be hearing that one anytime soon.  Oops.  STP.  Hey!  You broke it, man.  I wanted to hear that baby.  On the air.  Oh, we got to go home.  Hey, Adam.  Adam Ferrara on the phone.  What are you doing?  I'm on the air, Adam Ferrara. 
[04:22:00]  Adam Ferrara is going to be at...  Is he?  Where's he going to be?  Stress Factory this weekend.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Go see Adam.  Say hi, Adam.  Hello.  Adam just said hi.  Good.  But it's on my iPhone, so you ain't going to hear shit.  Because he doesn't make enough money doing fucking Rescue Me and his films.  Oh, that he's on the road all the time.  Where are you right now?  What?  What?  Oh.  All right.  All right.  He's in the faraway land of the LIE driving out to Long Island.  All right.  I got to go because I'm on the air, but I'll call you later.  Say hi to the fam. 
[04:22:30]  All right.  All right, Pally.  Your friendliness make me sick.  I love Adam.  I've known him for years.  Hey, be careful.  Drive safe.  Don't forget the signal.  All right.  We got to go home.  By the way.  Don't forget the signal.  You're a douche.  I'm just spoiling things again.  Yes, you are.  Hey, Smud, S-M-U-D from Whackbag writes, Epic War.  Ooh.  Fire up the blimp.  You fuckers.  I think you should fire the blimp.  I was going to say goodbye.  Don't yell at Steve.  Don't honk him, Steve. 
[04:23:00]  Give him something real this time.  Give him something real.  Give him something real.  Oh, no.  He's hugging him.  Oh, he just poured water down Jimmy's bag.  Wow, Steve is angry.  Oh, sweetie.  Look how passive aggressive Steve is.  Steve, make Jimmy suck your cock.  Make me suck your cock.  Please.  You just have to make it stop.  That makes it sexy.  I want him to hurt.  Covered with honey.  That's right.  I'm afraid of diseases here.  Put this piece of gum on it.  It'll fucking pop in my mouth.  It's a pop joke if you're in high school.  By the way, now that Jose is long gone, I want to thank that rat for stopping by. 
[04:23:30]  Jesus.  Book signing today at 3.30 in fucking Ridgewood, New Jersey at that bookstore.  And I like the fact that he's just fucking blowing up all these cunt athletes.  I really do.  I love what he's doing.  He really is.  And the book is called Vindicated.  Oh, look.  Hamas puppet.  There's such fun people at Hamas.  It's a Hamas puppet show that shows a boy stabbing President Bush.  Their puppet shows can't even be fun.  They can't just be fun. 
[04:24:00]  Oh, look.  It's the I hate the Jew cookie monster.  That's right.  That's funny.  They do.  They make these cartoons where it's just anti-Semitism and anti-American.  C is for crowd, which I blow up with my bomb.  You fucking unfun people, you.  Jimmy.  Nothing fun.  I just found a chewed pen.  Oh, Christ.  That had to be Earl's.  I sure did.  There you go.  Earl loves chewing the pens up.  There you go.  I wonder where this one will go.  Jimmy loves chewed pens.  Yes, Jimmy does.  Oh, fuck.  There he goes.  The pen goes up his ass and gets taken out and put back on the table by the person that 
[04:24:30]  chews the pen to chew it.  How about you fucking put this in Earl's pen collection?  Chew on that, fucking stupid.  And you know what?  Oh, he put it down the front.  There's a little fucking onion bag for you.  You went ass to dick.  Yeah, my balls don't smell ever, but just the idea.  Yeah.  I have very clean balls.  Notoriously clean.  Well, now they smell like your ass.  Which is also very clean.  Okay.  Believe me.  Spit-shined asshole.  Well, thanks for sharing.  Sure.  What do you say?  We have a half a minute. 
[04:25:00]  Poor Fezzy.  We do.  Then we gotta go.  Hey, Fez.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that was a good show.  Yeah, but we have to address one other thing.  I hear there's been some weird things happening on this channel lately.  Oh, the things that...  I am going to machine gun this entire motherfucking building before I blow it up.  Die!  You're dead.  Who's next? 
[04:25:30]  Steve probably.  He's dead.  Ooh, Danny.  Uh, era.  HAHAHAHAHA  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA  AAHAHAHAHA </pre>
