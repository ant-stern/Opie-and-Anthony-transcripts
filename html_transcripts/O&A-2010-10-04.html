<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts' typical crude humor, self-deprecatingly joking about their position in satellite radio and celebrating their sixth anniversary, acknowledging a past 30-day suspension.  They recounted a poker game the previous night, featuring custom poker chips with their images and other show personalities. Opie's $1 chip dominated play, leading to a discussion of the game's dynamics. Chip detailed a terrifying flight due to severe turbulence, while Anthony shared a stand-up comedy near-disaster caused by malfunctioning hair clippers, showcasing photos of his patchy haircut.

The somber tone shifted with Jimmy Norton's account of Greg Giraldo's wake, including a humorous interaction with Colin Quinn, and a mention of Quinn's cousin, previously discussed due to an altercation with Anthony's brother.  Further details about Anthony's father's motorcycle history emerged.  The hosts then reviewed recent movies, panning *Salt* and *Date Night* (especially Steve Carell's performance), while offering a more positive take on *Predators*.  The discussion moved to Rick Sanchez's firing from CNN, sparked by controversial comments about Jon Stewart and Jews running the media, prompting a debate about the justification of his termination. The show concluded with talk of the Who's upcoming tour and a segment featuring songs personally significant to the hosts' youth.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on songs with suggestive lyrics of pedophilia, primarily "Young Girl" by Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, debated with callers Jeff (Richmond) and Eric (Kentucky), who suggested "14" by the Vandals.  This led to broader discussions about various artists like Kiss, the Kinks, Ozzy Osbourne, and the Who, intermixed with personal anecdotes.

The conversation then veered to sports, specifically the New York Jets' win (which bored Opie), a disappointing pumpkin patch visit for Opie, and the New York Mets' struggles, leading to speculation about managerial changes involving Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine. A West Virginia caller labeled Opie a "dick" for his perceived sports curse.

The show then covered Renaissance fairs and a lengthy, caller-initiated discussion about the attractiveness of NHL Ice Girls, featuring online image comparisons, particularly focusing on the Islanders' Ice Girls versus those of other teams.

A significant portion focused on Kimbra Hickey, the hand model from the *Twilight* book cover, with the hosts and callers mocking her attempts at further fame, including her book signings and Twitter activity. They decided to call her for an interview.

A later segment centered on Hickey's hand, using crude and sexually explicit humor and scenarios.  The discussion shifted to *Jersey Shore*, harshly criticizing Pauly D's music with a played clip, and using highly offensive and derogatory language to describe Snooki's appearance.

The show then launched into "Jacktober," targeting the Detroit radio show "Blaine and Allison in the morning," using offensive, homophobic, and misogynistic language to criticize the hosts' personalities, physical appearances, and a segment called "Will it Flush Friday?"  Clips were played and their low Twitter follower count was mocked.

The final segment, part of "Jocktober," discussed things children might not know due to technology, including using envelopes, can openers, and ice cube trays.  This led to a crude discussion of yogurt brands, repeated offensive insults targeted at Allison (the female Detroit radio host), mimicking her voice, and a "What's Number One" game about worst movie accents. Blaine and Allison were frequent targets, along with their radio show's playlist.  Studio intern Stevie was briefly pranked by Anthony. The segment closed with a show preview and celebrity tweet reading by Ira.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Be porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Oh, yeah.  What do we got, Monday?  Monday.  Jiminy Cricket.  That means five days to go. 
[00:01:00]  I thought it was Friday already.  What happened?  Five days to go.  It's our sixth anniversary today?  All right.  Are you kidding?  Six years on satellite radio?  Wow.  Six years without getting fired?  A new record for us.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  We did get suspended, though, for 30 days.  Yeah.  So it's not a clean record.  How many people said in that first year that we were getting fired at the end of one year? 
[00:01:30]  And then at the end of the first contract?  And then at the end of the other contract?  And then this one and that?  Eventually, they'll all be right.  Yeah.  But, I mean, weren't we supposed to be?  Remember everybody was saying we were done in October?  Bubba the Love Sponge has said it two or three times.  He has said it over the years that he's got inside info and company hates us.  The only inside info he has is cholesterol.  He's on notice.  Because it's inside of him.  He's got to be on notice for being a liar. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  There's a lot of guys that just lie.  Pants on fire.  What happened to Danny?  Where's Danny?  Danny.  Hopefully he's having medical issues.  Car troubles.  Car troubles?  Car troubles.  Or is it car-duh troubles?  Nah.  He was part of that poker game last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, we played poker last night.  It was a blast.  Had a good time.  Did you do well?  Haven't played at my house yet with all the new accoutrement and chips.  What's that? 
[00:02:30]  No, chip.  There weren't people commenting on the chip chip.  What's that?  But one thing we noticed from the shakedown game is because I have chips.  I have chips with characters from the program on it.  And unfortunately for the likes of Sam and D-Boy, not able to fit everybody on.  I don't know what the criteria was.  Keith the cop made up the chips.  Whatever.  But do you know what chip is used the most out of any of the characters' chips that we 
[00:03:00]  have?  Do you know how hard this is?  Do I just keep saying what?  What?  What?  Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.  The character that's the most used.  What are the denominations?  Well, Opie, much to people's chagrin and much to their note, is the $1 chip.  Yeah, I get it.  That's funny, though.  I get it.  No, there's something else going on there.  Not with Anthony, but who made these? 
[00:03:30]  Keith?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I get it.  Well, it goes with the whole goof thing of, you know.  The cheap thing that went away 10 years ago?  Okay, yeah.  All right.  And Travis is the $5 denomination.  Right.  Danny is $25.  And then Keith the cop is the $100.  The nerve of him.  The nerve.  Little Jimmy is $500.  And, of course, me being the proprietor, I am the $1,000 chip. 
[00:04:00]  What?  Oh, I know.  The chip that gets the most use?  The $5.  Absolutely right.  Travis.  The Travis chip is the one that is just used the most.  Has to be.  Amazing.  Amazing.  The one is kids play.  That's like throwing pennies in.  Your chip gets used very, a lot at the beginning of the game. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  When we're going 1-2, before the blinds get raised.  How many times is my chip spit on at your house?  I don't think.  Let's be honest with each other here.  How many times do my chips get thrown, spit on, stomped on?  I don't think it was getting spit upon.  He spits on Opie's chips.  I don't understand it.  No, there's a whole bunch of them. 
[00:05:00]  Nice.  And I think you actually have the most chips in the case.  In the set?  Yeah.  And then Travis.  And we need a few more.  We noticed we needed to order some more Danny's.  But it is kind of fun because you don't say the amount.  You go, here we go.  I'm betting five Travis's.  Five Travis's right here.  And it's like, oh, well, raise it up to Danny's.  Raise it up to Danny's.  Oh, look out.  So you don't even have to say the numbers. 
[00:05:30]  And then it's like, oh, they're pulling out a Jimmy.  Oh, it's a Jimmy's coming out.  Come on now.  Derek's arguing that he might be used the most because isn't he the button?  Uh, well, we wanted him as the button.  Oh, he's not?  No, it just turned out to be the logo from the table.  That makes me so happy.  We are looking into, though, getting a button with D-Boy and adding a $10 chip with, of  course, Sam.  There's no $10 chip?  No, you don't really need one.  Huh?  Well, yeah.  You need one?  With the fives. 
[00:06:00]  Because you kind of got the fives and the 25.  Yeah, but you got another character in there.  How about a $27 chip?  You put the $27 one and you make that Sam.  Good idea, Chip.  What's that?  Because he knows about chips.  It's a chip.  Oh, it's a loop.  He's going to get stuck in a loop.  I wish he was stuck in a noose.  Yeah, maybe you get stuck in a noose, too.  Oh, Chip.  Boy, we missed ye. 
[00:06:30]  How was your gigs and flying and everything else?  The flight, the pilot, we get there and we're nervous, Rax.  I'm listening to this show, which I shouldn't be, and I'm listening to you and your shitty  map reporting.  Well, according to the radar, it's really bad down there.  Yeah, it looks bad in Raleigh.  We were getting reports on Twitter that trees are down, 20 inches of rain in Raleigh.  Well, you weren't alone.  The pilot got the same reports.  Oh, really?  We get on the plane, and he gets over the loudspeaker, and he says, that would have been 
[00:07:00]  more comforting.  He goes, well, we'll be taking it off, and blah, blah, blah.  He goes, there's no way to sugarcoat it.  He said, no way to sugarcoat it?  He said, there's no way to sugarcoat it.  It's going to be ugly.  And he goes, ugly all the way down.  All the way down.  We got clouds from here down.  It clears up a little bit to the west, but once we get airborne, one hour, 25 minutes  of torture.  So write some notes to your loved ones. 
[00:07:30]  He said torture?  Staple your name to your jacket.  Dude, he said torture.  I can't remember the last time I had a torture flight.  Dude, torture.  Was it bad?  What a panicky Pete.  We take off.  Yeah.  And there's clouds, literally, no bumps for the first 40 minutes.  Nice.  So I'm looking at the clock, because it's a prop plane, so it's like, I know that if  it's bumpy, it's going to terrify me.  We hit five bad minutes at about 40 to 45 minutes in.  Five bad minutes.  And they were just, I probably wouldn't even have thought of them as bad minutes if I wasn't 
[00:08:00]  anticipating, oh, here it comes.  Here's the beginning of this nightmare.  But then it kind of balanced out.  Was it bumpy, or was it a lot of the plane flying kind of sideways?  No sideways, until we were landing yesterday morning, like a little bit of sideways, but  that was just winds.  But it was like, on a prop, because the wing is over the plane, like on a prop, it's a  big prop, but it drops.  You feel a drop.  It's just a weird way you feel the turbulence in that plane.  Don't you feel like those wings are going to just fly away?  Dude, they really shouldn't be on top of the plane like that. 
[00:08:30]  Just bust off.  It helped me to look at them.  I looked out the window at the wings, and I just stared at them while I felt this horrendous  five minutes.  And watched them just kind of shake a little bit.  No, they were doing all, I'm like, there's nothing wrong with the wings.  They're fine.  The structure is not, there's nothing wrong, pussy.  It's just on the...  You just got to make sure they're glued on properly.  Yes.  Hope the water doesn't knock them off.  Proper glue.  So it wasn't that bad of a flight.  It was a great flight.  It was two of the best flights I've had there and back, honest to God.  And you made the right move by changing your flights. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I think the next one...  Because it got ugly after you guys left.  Oh, did it get worse?  Oh, yeah, it did.  And the club is great.  Good Nights is unbelievable.  A buddy of mine runs at Brad Reeder, comedian, and a lot of fucking O&A fans down there, man.  Yeah, North Carolina is a hot...  I couldn't believe how many hardcore fans were there.  Cool.  And that, by the way, that's me when I was cutting my hair.  Ten minutes to eight.  This is not an exaggeration.  On Saturday, a sold-out show.  And my clippers kept dying.  No kidding.  Dude, I didn't know you had to plug them in first. 
[00:09:30]  I thought when the light was lit, that meant they were being usable.  But that just meant they were charging.  Oh, shit.  So, literally, it would stop, and then I would charge it for two minutes, and then it would go like...  Oh, do you look like you need an AZT shot?  You should have done one of your shows like that.  It was sold-out Saturday.  I couldn't...  Chemo head.  Why not, man?  It was so bad, dude.  You think it would have been a distraction?  It would have been horrendous.  I couldn't have done it.  We're looking at a picture of Jim Norton's head where it's all blotchy.  I Twittered the photos before.  Yep, the mange. 
[00:10:00]  I thought you were just going for goof photos, because I saw them.  No!  But I didn't read the caption that your razor was just shit in the bed.  The first one you see there, which I...  Is there a way to see what time that was posted, Sam?  It was...  Jesus.  That was like the second time it had happened.  That was even more progress.  What, did it just go like...  Yeah, it was like...  The blades are just going...  Ch-cunk, ch-cunk, ch-cunk, ch-cunk.  It was at one point...  Kenny's...  Oh, Kenny's not here.  He saw it.  But at the end, I was... 
[00:10:30]  I was charging it for a minute, and I would go like one line.  Mmm!  And I would get like the little piece of hairs that I had missed, and it would die.  And I'd plug it in, and it was...  Dan, can you turn it this way, please?  Um, it was...  Oh, see, the clock is all fucked up.  It says 4.54.  That couldn't have been...  No, no, it was probably 5 to, uh...  It was like 5 minutes to show time.  Oh, you know what?  That might be a 3-hour difference.  5...  North Carolina's 3-hour difference?  No, maybe that's...  That might be... 
[00:11:00]  The feed might be based in West Coast time, so that might actually be 7.54 East Coast time.  For an 8 o'clock show.  For an 8 o'clock show, yeah.  It was about 8 minutes of 8.  Jeez.  Wow.  Were you just, like, freaking out and cursing?  I was out of my mind.  Yeah.  But once I was able to start it and then get a little charge, I was like, you will get this done.  It's going to take a bit, but you will get it done.  Yeah, it was humiliating.  But a good time, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  Or was it Friday?  Maybe it was Friday.  What do I know?  Good time had by all.  Mmm.  Well, that's good. 
[00:11:30]  Great club, man.  I really loved it down there.  And the fans were tremendous.  Right.  It's nice to see us being popular in a place that we were never on terrestrial.  All our fans are tremendous.  Yeah.  But there's no regular radio bleed over there.  Yeah.  Just like Minneapolis a couple years ago.  There's no, that's all satellite fans.  Yeah.  Which is great.  They've only known the show on satellite.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Good to hear.  Really fast.  How depressing was last night, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Greg's within a private wake last night.  His wake is today and the funeral's tomorrow.  It was very sad.  Very sad.  The only reason I bring it up, I tweeted it too, but, you know, Geraldo had three sons. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  They're running around.  Yeah.  And then his mom's on a couch in front of the casket.  Just, you know.  Devastated.  Yeah.  That is the worst scene ever.  Well, it's not fun for anybody.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  It's just, oh.  But if you go to my Twitter, there's a link to, you know, to donate to some kind of fun  for his sons.  Oh, you have good, I wanted to make sure that was legit.  There was an email I got or something. 
[00:12:30]  I wanted to make sure.  Yeah, I got it from Bob Saget, so I'm assuming it's legit.  Okay, it probably is.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that it was legit.  No, no, I think you're right.  Okay.  Saget's always the source of legitimate generosity.  Yeah, I know, I know.  That creep.  But I figured it has to be legit, because Bob Saget is never serious.  No.  And he was serious about this tweet, so I'm like, okay, this has to be  It has to be legit.  Yeah, he, uh.  Oh, there it is, right?  Okay, so.  Let me see, buddy.  You can get to it through my Twitter.  I don't know.  I think that, yes.  At the very least, just keep retweeting it, and people with money bags will help out.  But to see his sons running around, I was just like, what the fuck? 
[00:13:00]  It was very sad.  It was, you know, you sign in, and you take a little funeral card, and then you wait,  and you sell out to the family.  And it was really sad, because I didn't know his, I knew his family knew me, obviously,  because I'm a tough crowd, and we've done enough things together where they had to have  seen me.  So I was meeting them for the first time, and it was his sister, we said hello briefly.  And Marianne, I knew.  His, I don't know if they were still married, or if they were divorced, or they're on the 
[00:13:30]  way to divorce.  But it was his ex, I guess.  And her and I talked for about five minutes, and she was telling me about the boys.  And, you know, she was holding up okay.  And, you know, it's like when you go into plan mode.  When someone dies, you've got to plan everything.  And, all right, we've got to call this guy, get this organized, funeral's going to be,  it's your fucking organizing.  It's like your mind, instead of just grieving, you're checking things off a list that have  to be done physically.  But the hard part was the brother, who was nice.  I mean, he goes, hi, I'm Greg's brother.  And he looks just like Geraldo.  He really does.  But I couldn't talk to him. 
[00:14:00]  I knew I was going to cry, and I couldn't talk to the mother.  I said hello, and she was, she was like shivering.  Yeah.  She was so, because you're not supposed to bury your kids.  It's fucking unnatural.  So it was, it was too, I just, I don't want to depress anybody by being so sad in front  of them.  It's like, they're sad enough.  They don't need to comfort me.  Right.  So I literally just, I gave my condolences, and I just, I had to walk away, and it was  very, very sad.  Then, did you kneel down?  Yeah, I did.  I had to.  I went for the kneel down, because of my, my Christianity roots. 
[00:14:30]  And then I didn't know what to say.  I'm like, holy, all right, just fucking do some, like, like, God shit with your hands.  Yeah.  And then I tapped the, the coffin and moved on.  It wasn't an open casket.  Oh, it was closed?  No.  Good.  Thank God.  No, open caskets are old school.  Good.  Most of, most of the ones that, from our generation or whatever, they, they closed that shit right  up.  Put the old codgers in the open casket.  No.  Yes.  No, this was closed.  Colin Quinn made it fun in the lobby, though, thank God.  Yeah, he was funny, always.  Who's that character from Boardwalk that you were dressed up as? 
[00:15:00]  Colin goes, I don't think Jimmy liked that one.  I didn't hear it.  What was it?  What's his name?  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  I didn't hear it.  Oh, God.  The Steve Buscemi character?  Dude, I just got that.  Really?  When Colin said, oh, the son of a bitch.  Oh, yeah.  Nucky Johnson.  I didn't get it.  He was calling you Nucky Johnson all night.  That's because I had a pinstripe jacket.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Then all of a sudden it goes to me.  I don't think Norton appreciated that one.  That's hilarious.  I didn't, I didn't, I only heard him say it once. 
[00:15:30]  Your new name is Nucky.  He said to someone, I didn't know you were friends with Nucky Johnson, I think.  And I just thought, because Colin will make up stupid names.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought he was just making up one of his ridiculous names that he makes up.  I forgot, because I forgot that was Buscemi's character.  You're wearing a pinstripe jacket.  Yeah, pretty much.  Spinning a watch.  Oh, that's goddamn funny.  That's really funny.  I wish I would have heard that.  I didn't catch it.  With your fedora on.  He kept it sane.  Oh, fuck.  I wish I would have heard that.  Colin kept it sane.  Or caught it. 
[00:16:00]  It was nice to see, it was nice to see Colin in a serious mood.  Yeah, he's good at stuff like that.  Yeah, he was really good.  He really was like the mayor there in the lobby, helping everybody out.  And he's so smart.  I said to him at one point, I don't know exactly where the funeral is yet.  We don't know.  I go, where's the funeral?  Oh, and on Tuesday, he goes, I don't know.  He goes, but every fucking comedian's the same.  We're all looking for the adult.  That's what all comedians do.  We look for the adult.  Good luck with that.  Right.  And I met a huge celebrity yesterday at Greg Girald. 
[00:16:30]  You work with one.  Huge celebrity.  Much bigger than you, Jimmy.  I'm really sorry to say.  It was Colin Quinn's cousin, Tim.  Oh, wow.  That he has talked about probably a hundred fucking times on this show.  He looks nuts, doesn't he?  He looks crazy.  He looks insane.  He's from Quorum, Long Island.  And his claim to fame, Anthony's brother Joe used to beat the shit out of him.  And Colin has pretty much told us that story maybe a hundred times on this show over the  last ten years.  And you finally met him.  Finally met him. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm like, holy shit, you're the guy.  That's the guy.  And he was all happy and proud.  Yeah, Joe used to beat me up.  And he said that, he said growing up that your dad used to have like a motorcycle gang  that used to stop by his house or something?  Yeah, well, he had motorcycles.  You never told us that one.  Well, he had a bike and all of his friends had motorcycles.  This guy, Tim, said there was a motorcycle gang that used to hang out at Anthony's house.  Well, yeah, there were some bikers.  They were into like riding and shit like that. 
[00:17:30]  I didn't know your dad was a bike guy.  Yeah, yeah.  My mom used to get pissed because we were little tater tots like in kindergarten.  And he would throw me on the gas tank of his motorcycle and ride around like doing 60  miles an hour with me just sitting on the gas tank in front of him.  What was it, a Suzuki or something?  No, I think he was like into...  He had to go Harley, right?  No, you know what?  It might have been like a Honda or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, just some big bike. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  I just remember like the heat coming off of it though and the smell of motorcycle and  it was kind of fun because I had no clue how insanely dangerous it was for a child to  be sitting on a slippery metal thing with an intoxicated gentleman driving a motorcycle.  There was no rules back then.  Smell of motorcycle is a good description because that really, you know exactly, you couldn't  prove what that means, but we all know what that means.  It's a mixture of heat and gasoline and oil and, yeah, tires. 
[00:18:30]  Just, that's how it smells.  Hey, can I give out that?  I'm going to, can I give out that thing?  Are you sure?  Because a lot of fans have been asking me who do I, no, it's care of Jim Norton.  It's a way to get, for Greg, I don't know if Greg was insured or not, but he has three  really young sons.  I mean, the oldest might be 14.  Gregory, yeah, I think he's 10.  He's a big kid.  Mary Ann told me he was 10.  Yeah, I believe he was 10.  The oldest is 10?  I believe so.  No. 
[00:19:00]  I haven't seen him since 2004 at Tough Crowd.  Okay.  I met young Gregory.  He's a very cute boy.  This is for the, this is a Geraldo Children's Fund and it's, so write this down because the  fans have been asking to take donations and care of Mary Ann and the name is McAlpin Geraldo.  I'll spell it for you.  There's a hyphen.  M-C, capital A-L-P-I-N, dash Geraldo.  I guess that's her maiden name. 
[00:19:30]  Care of Mary Ann, McAlpin Geraldo.  It's P.O.  Box 1827, New York, New York, 10025.  And I guess that goes to Geraldo's Children's Fund is the name of the, and I don't, I don't  mean to promote my Twitter.  It is my last tweet too.  So the link's right there.  Yeah, I was going to do, I just wanted to make sure, I forgot to ask her last time if  that was legit, but if Bob tweeted to you, and I think, I think it is.  It seems like it.  So hopefully because the kids at college is fucking expensive, man. 
[00:20:00]  Holy shit.  Fuck.  Like you want to fucking, it makes me, like I love Greg, but it makes me want to just,  what the fuck are you doing, man?  You know, it's like, you know, your friends fuck up.  It's like, what are you doing?  And that's your biggest fear.  We were talking about that Friday.  Shit.  That's why you're, that's why you're sober, man.  Yes.  That's, that's, that's, you know, that shit is way too close to home for guys like you.  It's like, but yeah, it's like he's no, I'm certainly no better in the universe's eyes  than Greg Geraldo is.  Of course not.  None, none.  Why am I, that would absolutely happen to me or it would, I would kill somebody drunk drive. 
[00:20:30]  It's like, that's why though.  It happens.  Right.  To people that you know, and it just, it usually doesn't hit this close, but you know, it happens.  Right.  All right.  It's fucking miserable.  But I learned that Anthony's father was in a motorcycle gang from cousin Tim.  So you might want to get Joe to beat him up again for giving out that info.  I don't think, I just kind of remember there being a lot of motorcycles around and his  friends rode motorcycles, but I don't think it was an organized gang.  He had like a very cool biker leather jacket though.  Was he part of like, uh, you know, the Hell's Angels or anything like that? 
[00:21:00]  No, no, it wasn't that organized.  What was the one on Long Island?  What, the pagans?  The pagans were huge fans of our show.  I think it was well before.  Yeah.  The pagans liked, uh.  The pagans.  I think it was before the pagans.  Yeah.  He had nothing.  It wasn't, it wasn't colors or anything.  He had a leather jacket, but, uh, the zippers on like the pockets had like, uh, uh, ace,  king, queen playing cards as little metal thing for the zipper that you'd hold and zip up.  So it was kind of dangled down.  It was just an old thick leather jacket. 
[00:21:30]  You dad?  Yeah.  I don't know where that went, but it was pretty cool.  That's a cool jacket.  It was a very cool, like, biker kind of jacket.  Yeah.  Do you have pictures of you, me, Opie, and Keith?  Is that what it was, or were they actually real?  But there you go.  Colin's fucking cousin.  Jesus.  Uh, what else is going on?  One of those guys just got in big trouble, I think.  Who?  One of the heads of the Pagans was in the...  They were showing in the paper.  Those guys don't play games, man.  No.  Fucking biker gangs are scary. 
[00:22:00]  Well, they got that rivalry with the Hells Angels that's been going on forever,  and every so often it blows up and people get killed.  I would hate to have them fucking after me.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Imagine that.  That would be miserable.  That would be awful.  It would be horrible.  Them waiting outside your building.  And you know they're coming because motorcycles are so loud,  you always know when they're there.  And you listen for how many bikes there are, and it's a shitload.  Fuck.  I'm in trouble.  Again.  And they're great with improvised weapons, pipes, wrenches. 
[00:22:30]  They just carry...  Most of them carry some kind of wrench in their pocket or locks inside a sock.  If you take a fucking padlock and put it inside a sock  and just swing that thing and smash someone in the face with it,  oh, well, you're going down.  Yeah, that's horrible.  Yeah.  Both things on the surface are nice.  Put them together, it's a horrendous thing to be struck by.  Or a pool ball, too. 
[00:23:00]  They've taken, like, cue balls or an eight ball,  then you put it in a sock, you tie the end,  and just wham!  You're getting so incredibly fucked up from that.  Oh, God.  Reminds me of Salt.  I saw that where she's building a weapon out of...  Did you see that?  No, I...  Oh, no.  I was reading your tweets all weekend.  You didn't like the movie Salt, did you?  It was shit.  The fucking...  I understood why they had to do a Russian thing, I guess,  because she was supposed to be from Russia as a spy when she was a kid,  so it's like she couldn't play a Muslim. 
[00:23:30]  Ah.  But just enough with the Russians.  They're going to kill the president.  It was, like, so fucking corny.  It had to be the Russians?  Well...  Why the Russians?  Because the storyline was...  We didn't have any problems with the Russians.  Not anymore, no.  Dragonfly to Wolves Den.  Call it full names.  Was it...  What was it?  The Russians were coming back, making a comeback?  But, well, it was because they had planted these children here in childhood.  Oh.  And, I mean, I understood why they had to go with a certain...  Because Angelina Jolie cannot play a Muslim. 
[00:24:00]  She could have played a Chechnyan, but whatever.  True.  It made sense in that.  But just the whole storyline of the president...  And I knew who the other bad guy was from the minute the movie started.  Yeah.  Of course!  Yeah.  And then the president's in danger.  Was that your movie?  Exactly.  Was that your movie?  The president's in...  Chip thought this movie was great.  Salty.  They should have called it, like, Salty Buns.  Oh, that would have been a good one.  That was your movie starring Turk? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, Turk February.  Turk February.  Turk February was saving the president.  He's a man of intrigue.  He sure is.  A man of intrigue?  And then I heard the next one is going to be Salt 2, where she fights Liam Neeson, the  head of the IRA.  I was like, what are you fucking...  What are we, in 1984?  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  What the fuck are you doing?  The movie was done.  Why did you watch the whole movie?  I was flying the next morning, and I was just up, so I just watched it on a pay-per-view  in North Carolina.  Oh, okay.  With TVA.  I saw a shitty movie, too, man.  What did you say?  What night was that?  Saturday, I guess?  It was a movie that you were talking about, so I'm like, you know what? 
[00:25:00]  I got the Blu-ray.  I'm going to pop it in.  Uh-oh.  Date Night.  That movie sucked.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know.  Fucking Steve Carell is the most unfunny, funny person.  You, yeah, you hate Steve Carell.  He seems like a nice guy.  I'm not a fan.  The first year or two of, you know, the American office, he was pretty good, but I don't think  the guy is funny, and I don't think the guy could carry a film.  And then Tina Fey's in it, and I'm a huge 30 Rock fan.  Yeah.  And if you know Tina Fey just from 30 Rock, you could tell that she had nothing to do 
[00:25:30]  with this movie.  She was reading other people's lines.  Yeah.  Because the comedy in that was so douchey.  I'm like, Tina Fey would never write this shit.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's one of those.  It was cool to see Bill Burr, but even Bill Burr frustrated me, because I'm like, Bill  Burr should be talking more in this movie, but for some reason he's not.  I know.  It's such a small part.  He was like, he was the partner of the black detective.  How funny was it, though, when he comes out on the rooftop at the end, and he's like, 
[00:26:00]  all right, drop your guns.  Yeah.  It's just Bill Burr running with a gun.  And after he explained that gun scene.  Running with a gun.  All right, drop your guns.  Yeah.  Just laughing.  But that movie was fucking horrible.  And then at the end, they were doing the famous outtakes like Burt Reynolds used to do with  the gang.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Steve Carell is improvising, talking through the apartment thing when you ring down for  somebody.  Mm-hmm.  And he had nothing to say.  I'm like, why would you even leave that as the credits are rolling? 
[00:26:30]  He didn't improv anything funny there.  They must have thought it was hysterical.  He sucks.  Hysterical.  Was he in any good movies?  40-Year-Old Virgin, I guess, right?  That was a big one.  He's been in a few big...  That was an Apatow movie, I think, right?  What other movie was he in?  Yeah.  Because you'd be surprised how many bombs he has now.  Because the dinner with the schmucks, or whatever it was called, I saw that, and he took  me out of the movie.  Evan Almighty.  It's a horrible movie.  I mean, I'm trying to think.  What else was he in?  He was in...  I don't know.  He was a Daily Show guy, I think, at one point. 
[00:27:00]  I loved him on...  You know what?  But that's why I can't totally trash him.  I loved him on the Daily Show.  I really did.  He was good.  And when he first started doing The Office, I liked him.  I've never seen The American Office for more than five minutes.  He was in Get Smart.  Yeah.  Oh, Get Smart.  That's right.  Dan in Real Life.  Evan Almighty, we said.  He was in Little Miss Sunshine.  Yeah.  Did he have a small role?  I don't remember anymore.  Pretty big part.  Okay.  I love that movie.  Anchorman. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean...  Whatever.  But that date night was horseshit.  Yeah.  Fucking horseshit.  And look at this.  We're talking movies.  You saw one?  I saw one, too.  I saw one, too.  Predators.  Predators.  Predators.  Yeah, it's the one with Adrian Brody.  And it's a bunch of people.  They end up on, you know, some planet that is used as kind of a game preserve for the 
[00:28:00]  predators to hunt.  Right.  And not bad, but Adrian Brody goes through the entire movie sounding exactly like Christian  Bale in Batman.  Oh, really?  To the point where it's annoying, and I don't know why.  I don't know why Adrian Brody's talking like this during the whole movie.  It's how they think bad guys should talk or tough guys. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'm leaving this fucking place.  And I don't...  And it's like Adrian Brody?  The guy from fucking The Pianist?  What the fuck is he doing?  I guess that's a new thing to, you know, make him sound more...  It was really, like, distracting.  Really?  But, you know, it was cool.  I didn't mind it.  Harmless fun.  Definitely open for a huge sequel. 
[00:29:00]  Well, of course.  Obviously.  Kind of a cool concept.  Right.  It's always good to see predators with their vagina mouths.  When did this...  Vagina teeth mouth.  When did Predators come out?  Eh, I don't know.  Three months.  Yeah.  Four months ago.  Yeah.  You know, it's on...  It's on the still-in-theaters thing when you're in a hotel or something, you know?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not bad, but...  Yeah.  Don't expect miracles out of it. 
[00:29:30]  And the annoying Adrian Brody fucking voice is...  Yuck.  All right.  But I did notice one thing.  There's a lot of weaponry being fired in that movie.  Mm-hmm.  And I think there were only three guns...  You don't have?  ...in the movie that I don't have.  Holy shit.  I'm watching going, well, all right, I got that.  You know what you gotta do now.  I got that.  You know what you gotta do.  Get the ones that I don't have. 
[00:30:00]  Gotta get the complete set.  Of course.  Oh, it came out in July.  Okay.  Yeah.  A few months ago.  A few months ago.  See what Steve Carell does?  He took the energy out of the show.  Oh, my God.  That's Steve Carell.  He just took the energy out of the show.  That's how bad he is.  Why does he continue to get movie roles?  I don't know.  Hollywood loves him.  Yeah.  They fucking love that guy.  I don't know why.  Keeps getting work.  I don't know why.  I don't know why he bothers me so much. 
[00:30:30]  Keeps getting work, but, you know...  He bothers you.  I'll be...  Excuse my interruption.  Because he's a multi-millionaire fucking Hollywood star?  Because you're a bigot.  And you only like people who are like you.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Fucking our friend Pete Dominick got Rick Sanchez fired, huh?  I think Rick Sanchez got Rick Sanchez fired.  You know what, though?  Because I heard Pete didn't really...  Pete was just like, why are you saying that?  You know, he just kind of...  Damn.  You know what, though?  I think...  First of all, do you think Rick Sanchez should have been fired?  I have very mixed feelings about it because he was a dick about me when me and Ventura fought. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  And he played those dumb Twitters.  He was kind of snarky and douchey.  I don't like the guy.  I don't either.  And I think he was wrong to say that he was targeted just because he was Cuban.  I don't think Stewart's a bigot.  I don't think John...  I really don't.  Are you saying that now?  That's what annoyed me.  He goes, yeah, John Stewart would only target him.  He goes, oh, look at the little Puerto Rican guy.  And Stewart's not a bigot.  He was just making fun of him probably because he thought he was an ass.  John Stewart makes fun of every single one of them.  But he's not a...  To call him a bigot is unfair. 
[00:31:30]  Have you seen his...  Tree-hugging, bed-wetting liberal, but...  Yeah.  Have you seen John Stewart go after Glenn Beck?  That video's pretty fucking funny, man.  Yeah.  He goes after all of them.  Yeah.  Absolutely all of them.  Well, Rick Sanchez felt that because they always attack Fox that he is the one on the CNN side that they have to hit.  And he feels Stewart picked him because he's Cuban.  But then he started saying stuff, but he only likes guys like himself, meaning he said he called him a northern...  One thing he said that was, I like...  Oh, okay.  It was about northern liberals. 
[00:32:00]  We could go through the audio.  I don't know.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Absolutely.  I listened to the audio and I feel like, you know, Rick Sanchez was just comfortable on Pete Dominic's show.  It's the context again.  Yeah.  Pete Dominic is a comedian first.  I think Rick Sanchez knows that going into it.  And I think Rick Sanchez felt like this is a place he could kind of just let loose a little bit.  But Pete's pretty good at getting information, too.  He's not a bad interviewer at all.  Like, I know him for a long time.  And yet when you're sitting down with him, he's just good at getting you to talk, which... 
[00:32:30]  Well, we've got a couple...  Just a couple clips from the big interview that got Rick Sanchez fired from CNN on Pete Dominic's show right here on satellite radio.  It's on POTUS, right?  POTUS, yeah.  I think Jon Stewart's a bigot.  I think he looks...  I think Jon Stewart's a bigot.  Hold on.  Now we're going to get into Jon Stewart, my old boss, my friend.  Yeah, I think he's a bigot.  How is he a bigot?  I think he looks at the world through his mom, who was a schoolteacher, and his dad, who was a physicist or something like that.  Great. 
[00:33:00]  I'm so happy that he grew up in a suburban, middle-class, New Jersey home with everything that you could ever imagine.  What group is he bigoted towards?  Everybody else who's not like him.  Look at his show.  I mean, what does he surround himself with?  Well, listen, he picks on Jews all the time.  He's a Jew.  Yeah.  He focuses on them.  I think he overcompensates to some extent.  I always notice that.  Yeah.  He goes after himself and people like him and everybody else.  I totally disagree with you, and I defy giving you a specific example.  Let me give you an example of what I mean about that, by the way. 
[00:33:30]  I don't necessarily think...  That's pretty strong words.  Call Jon Stewart a bigot.  Call anybody a bigot.  Give me an example.  Well, that's what happens when you watch yourself on his show every day, and all they ever do is call you stupid.  Well, so far, so good, right?  Yes.  Nothing in there that he should be fired over?  No, not at all.  Then again...  It's his opinion.  I know, but people get fired for their opinions now, which is completely disgusting.  I mean, I'm sorry, but I just don't buy this thing that the only people out there who are prejudiced, all right?  The only people out there who are prejudiced are the right. 
[00:34:00]  There's people who are prejudiced on both sides.  But you're not giving me a specific example.  You're saying he's bigoted towards people who aren't like him?  His guests come from every...  He has the most right wing.  I think...  I think...  Don't you point your sharpie at me, Sanchez.  Don't you take your sharpie out.  I think Jon's show is essentially prejudicial.  I think that Jon's show is...  Against who?  Against anybody who doesn't agree with his point of view, which is very much a white, liberal establishment point of view. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  I'll agree with that, by the way.  But isn't that going on across the board with these guys?  Well, yeah, right and left.  I mean, obviously, if you tune in...  I mean, O'Reilly, come on.  You tune in...  Right.  Even Hannity.  You tune in Hannity.  Yeah, he's no better than the rest of them is what...  What is Rick trying to say there, though?  He's singling him out, but they all do that, don't they?  When you start to get into other stuff, though, so far, to me, he has said nothing that should get him in any trouble.  The word bigot is a little strong and a little inaccurate as far as Jon Stewart goes. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think he's a bigot.  I think he's definitely way biased to the left.  He's got an agenda on a comedy show.  It's a comedy show, and he's got an agenda.  But, again, so does the right when you talk about Glenn Beck and Hannity and shows like that.  Well, it continues here.  I see stuff O'Reilly and Glenn Beck do, and I say, wow, that's very discriminatory. 
[00:35:30]  That's very prejudicial.  And I look at stuff that Colbert and Jon Stewart do, and I think, wow, that's very prejudicial.  So, you know, we have a tendency to only look at one side.  I'm saying we ought to be able to look at both sides.  That's all I'm saying.  I certainly agree with that.  But here...  If we're going to call one side bigoted, we probably got to look at the other side and say the same thing.  Well, I'd be careful with the word bigot.  I'll take the word bigot back.  I'll say prejudicial.  Look at what I did here.  Uninformed.  Right there, what he's saying is, you know, fair. 
[00:36:00]  You know, people always accuse the right of a certain thing, and the left is certainly too.  Bigoted is not biased to people who are of their political ilk is probably a better way.  But he is right, though.  The liberals do get away with any type of...  I guess it's always targeted to conservatives.  Especially in the context of comedy.  The left will always get away with more shit than the right will as far as comedy goes.  Jon Stewart could say whatever the fuck he wants on his show about the right, and it's like, oh, it's comedy. 
[00:36:30]  It's okay.  If the right tries it, if somebody tries it on the right, it turns into this, oh, my God, he's a horrible person.  He's talking hate speech.  So I agree with Rick Sanchez on that, but I don't agree.  It's like this is where I'm split.  Because he's saying, I think that the things that Colbert and Jon Stewart do are prejudicial.  I think that things that Hannity do...  Hannity has never done anything that has made me feel he was prejudicial racially or religiously, and neither is Stewart. 
[00:37:00]  They just, to me, politically are leaning in one direction.  But prejudicial or bigoted, I've never seen Hannity do anything that was, to me, bigoted.  I've never seen Colbert or Stewart.  It's almost like he's making it into something that is based on ethnicity or race or religion, when for them it's politics.  Political ideology.  Right, political ideology.  Well, here's where Rick gets himself in trouble. 
[00:37:30]  No, this is it.  Final clip.  But I just think it's important that people who are not minorities understand that those of us who are, and very few of us will say the things that I've just said, are actually more complex than they think we are.  And we get them.  Stewart's a minority, as much as you are.  Come on.  How is he a minority?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rick.  Very powerless people.  Whoa.  I mean, you're such a minority.  I mean, you know, please.  What are you kidding? 
[00:38:00]  You're telling me that...  I'm telling you that everybody who runs CNN is a lot like Stewart, and a lot of people who run all the other networks are a lot like Stewart.  And to imply that somehow they, the people in this country who are Jewish, are an oppressed minority?  Yeah.  They have a history of oppression, no?  No question about that.  They can't relate to that?  I grew up in Miami.  Every one of my best friends was Jewish.  What are you talking about?  They can't relate to that?  A Jewish person doesn't always have a constant fear in the back of their head that we could resist the Holocaust?  I think his father could. 
[00:38:30]  He got fired for that?  That's it.  That was amazing.  He got fired for that?  He got fired for the implication.  He was hinting that the Jews run the media.  Jews run the media.  Let's get right into it.  Which is the big...  And is that a bad thing to say?  Isn't...  Why is that a bad thing to say?  That's a bad thing to say.  Because...  I don't even understand.  I don't even understand why that would be a bad thing to say.  It's a stereotype.  Yeah.  They look at it as a stereotype.  They look at it as a stereotype because there are certain people in the media that are of power that aren't Jewish. 
[00:39:00]  Point them out.  Murdoch.  Right.  Murdoch's not Jewish.  Yeah.  Bloomberg.  Oh, he is Jewish.  Yeah, Bloomberg's Jewish.  Bloomberg is not Jewish?  No, I'm just calling him a name.  Oh.  Bloomberg's Jewish.  Murdoch is...  Now, who else am I thinking of?  Murdoch is another one.  I think you covered it.  No, there's another guy, I think, who's...  He didn't say...  Fuck.  He didn't say Jews run all media.  Could somebody...  Some listener might know.  A big media mogul who's not Jewish.  There's one of those guys who owns a tremendous...  Ted Turner.  Ted Turner's right. 
[00:39:30]  He's not Jewish.  But he got fired over that.  That's bad news, man.  That really was kind of...  That's bad news.  He'll get another job.  Yeah.  I miss NBC.  We'll probably pick him up.  And I think he's an asshole just because I think he's one of those snarky guys.  And he's one of those guys that pulls out the bigot card too fast.  It's almost like...  That's also insightful in the media, is a guy who pulls out the bigot card.  Look how fucking quick he was to accuse someone else of ethnic bigotry.  And then look what he's saying. 
[00:40:00]  He's harboring this secret resentment against Jews.  Well, by the way, so does fucking Pete Dominick.  He pulls out that goddamn race card...  Yes.  ...and bigot card in a second.  We've been sitting here and, you know, you say something and all of a sudden he's just  accusing you of being a racist and a bigot.  And you're like, wait a minute, what?  I just gave my opinion on something.  And so it's almost ironic that it happened on his show when he is really quick on the  draw with that fucking bigot and racist word. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but you have to be ready when you say that to somebody.  If someone says that, you have to be very prepared to make them look silly for accusing  you of it, which is easy if you're not a bigot.  And you have to just be careful who you accuse of.  I would never accuse Stuart of bigotry, even though I don't agree with his politics.  No.  You weren't thinking of Sumner Redstone, were you?  I don't know if he's Jewish or not.  I was thinking of Ted Turner actually was another massive name that was popping up.  Like, guys that are...  Wow.  So what do you think?  He should have been fired for that? 
[00:41:00]  No.  I'm not saying he should have been fired, I just don't like him.  It was pretty subtle, too.  He was being kind of careful there.  He was kind of tiptoeing around it without saying, Jews, Ron Mania.  He was really screwed up.  We say that as a joke a lot.  He screwed up.  It's a stereotype.  Right.  Of course.  When he said that they're all like John over at CNN, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  And then he tied...  It could have still almost went political.  Yeah.  But then he tied the rope at the other end by saying Jews are minority.  It was almost like he mentioned Jews.  And then he's going, you know, everybody over there at CNN or whatever is like Jon Stewart. 
[00:41:30]  He probably could have got away with that if he was like, I was talking politically.  It could have been interpreted as right.  But then he tied it in with the Jewish thing at the end.  It was almost like if he just would have left it a little more open-ended.  He did.  Yeah, yeah.  He had to tie it all up in a nice bow.  Oh, boy, did he.  Yeah.  Put a yarmulke on it and here you go.  What a dope...  That's scary out there.  You're a newscaster, idiot.  We're going to have a very lame media where no one's going to be able to give their opinions  at all.  He's going to be too scared that they're going to be fired.  Another example of a guy... 
[00:42:00]  Well, he was scared that he would be fired for that.  So you could see he was kind of tiptoeing around it being very careful.  And that wasn't even good enough.  Yep.  And then he amended it.  He goes, maybe Bigot's too strong aware.  I shouldn't have said Bigot.  But it's weird because these media outlets now want their personalities to kind of, you  know, editorialize and give their opinion.  Right.  But now they're really quick to fire him for doing just that.  Yeah.  But watch out.  Very strange out there.  Extremely strange in the media.  All right.  We'll take a first break. 
[00:42:30]  Let's not forget it's Rocktober.  Rocktober.  Jocktober.  I keep saying Rocktober.  I don't know why.  That's okay because it is Rocktober.  Because for so many years we had to shove that down people's throats.  Rocktober.  Rocktober.  Which is the same as every other day of every other month on those stations.  Of course.  So we do Jocktober here.  So we'll see what show we're beating up today.  All right.  We'll talk a little baseball, a little football.  The Who announced their 2011 tour. 
[00:43:00]  Stop it.  I swear to God.  You know something, guys?  Please.  I swear to God.  Holy shit.  Please stop.  That's the old gag.  They retired how many times?  Oh, I know.  Farewell tours.  And comeback tours.  Oh.  He sounds like an old vicar.  He really does.  Look at him.  He's just...  That was from the Super Bowl last year, right?  That's just done already. 
[00:43:30]  Roger Daltrey sounded really good.  Who are you?  Who, who?  Who, who?  My j-j-generation.  Nice.  My j-j-j-generation.  Talking about my j-j-j-j-geritol.  There it is.  There it is.  Series XM.  The virus.  Call the O&A show. 
[00:44:00]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The O.B. and Anthony show.  What's your favorite who song, Ant?  Let me think. 
[00:44:30]  It's something off Quadrophenia.  Like, I don't know.  Punk vs. Godfather or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You go a little obscure, huh?  Yeah.  I like that Quadrophenia album.  I'm not going to ask Jimmy.  He hates the hoe.  I wouldn't say...  I might go with Love Rain or Me.  Or Me.  They never had that V in there, did they?  Yes.  Love Rain or Me.  That's a good one.  This is...  They're great musicians, though.  You can't say that they are.  And they changed their sounds.  This is good. 
[00:45:00]  They start out as a very, like, very poppy...  Poppy.  Like British pop, right?  Yeah, that British Invasion kind of silly sound.  Do, do, do.  You like any hoot songs, Jimmy?  Yeah, I mean, like, you know, I understand they were good.  I mean, my generation is good.  And a lot of the hits I like, I'll listen to the hoot they're on.  I used to hate them, but I've kind of mellowed.  They're okay.  When I was...  That's not my favorite.  When I was younger and douchier than I am today, I used to like Behind Blue Eyes because...  Man. 
[00:45:30]  I got blue eyes and no one knows what it's like.  Yeah.  What did it say?  Vacant Behind Blue Eyes?  I thought they were talking about me, man.  Man.  I'll throw myself out of the bus.  It's all about me, man.  I relate to this one, man.  Yeah.  I like this song.  What a douche I was.  It's a good tune.  Yeah, is it?  I like this one still. 
[00:46:00]  But now I just listen to it as a cool song.  I don't look into the lyrics like I used to.  Yeah.  You ever have a song that talked to you?  Oh, Jimmy's got one.  Oh, God.  I know.  I can picture you looking straight off like just nobody knows what it's like.  That's right.  Yeah.  I bet you'd walk and just kind of think of this song and how it related to you.  Of course I did.  Of course.  Look around at all those unknowing faces.  They don't know what it's like.  They don't know what it's like. 
[00:46:30]  What year is that, Danny?  It's a good song.  That's got it.  This is 64?  No, that picture is the 60s.  Yeah.  They came out right after the Beatles did, really.  Dolce looks like he has fucking Down syndrome.  No kidding.  Did you have a song that talked to you?  Come on, man.  I'm the only fish bag here today.  Of course I did.  Everyone did.  One where.  God, this is good.  What makes this song so good is that it kicks in. 
[00:47:00]  See, I wish it wouldn't.  I like this.  Really?  Yeah.  They're building.  Come on.  Yeah.  Did you have a song that talked to you?  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  Sure, the house next door to me.  Still speaks to me to this day.  I know Jimmy has one.  I don't know why he's not throwing himself under the bus and joining me.  I live under the bus.  I just can't think of one.  Let me.  I have to.  We all have.  Yeah.  That song you listen to and go, oh, this one is about me.  I can relate to this one. 
[00:47:30]  Let me think.  What about illustrated book about birds?  No, by that point in my life, by the time I heard that, I was older.  It would have to be something in teenage years where you have that manufactured angst.  Yeah, this was right out of high school, college type of thing.  Gary Puckett's Young Girl.  There you go.  Let me think.  There you go.  Benny Mordonis.  The drumming is great. 
[00:48:00]  Keith Boone was great, man.  Yeah.  Looked like a fucking lunatic when he played drums, too.  He was fucking great.  Oh, yeah.  I'm waiting for you to come up with one.  I'm trying to think, because I remember.  I remember listening to.  I was obviously a big Aussie Sabbath fan.  But I'm trying to think of what song I felt spoke to me. 
[00:48:30]  Because I was like that with all.  Like, you know, with Children of the Grave.  All their songs, I would be like, listen to the word.  But I was trying to think of what I thought.  Just keep it in the back of your head.  If you get one, let us know.  I will.  No, I went with Benny Mordonis.  I think it was Benny Mordonis.  Into the Night.  Yeah.  She was.  How did the lyrics go?  You got that one, Travis?  She was 16 years old.  Leave her alone, they say.  Yeah, oh, really?  That's your song, bro.  What the hell?  Benny Mordonis is what, the group?  This song. 
[00:49:00]  It was like a one-hit wonder.  This could be Anthony's song.  Yeah, is this one?  Oh, yeah.  This song is so about a pedophile.  When you do rock radio, you pepper these songs in there.  She's just 16 years old.  Leave her alone. 
[00:49:30]  They say.  They say, but what do you say?  Well, what do you think?  What do you say?  Yeah.  Separated by fools.  Yeah.  You don't know what love is, yeah.  Yeah.  This is fucking.  But I want you to know if I could fly.  I'd pick you up.  I'd take you in.  What's a bang of 16-year-old?  Christine's 16 is about that, too.  It's Kiss.  Like you've never seen. 
[00:50:00]  Show you a love like you've never seen.  Like you've never seen.  Gene Talk sings through part of that.  He goes, I normally don't say things like this to girls your age.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a great one.  You can't get away with that nowadays.  No, the other one.  If you find that goddamn Gary Puckett in the Union Gap song, Young Girl.  Because that's.  Even worse?  Worse.  At least this is kind of.  It's like having a dream.  All right, enough.  Yeah, like this one's at least like. 
[00:50:30]  Young Girl, though, he's just blatantly going like, uh-oh.  Listen, he can't take it.  Get out of my mind.  Get out of his mind.  Oh, shit.  Is this 50s or something?  Way out of line.  Like 60s?  Better run.  He's a raper.  And then, and then listen, he almost blames her in the words.  See?  Got all the charms of a woman.  But what happens? 
[00:51:00]  You've kept the secret of your youth.  Ah, secret.  You led me to believe you're old enough to give me love.  She's lying sack of shit.  And now it hurts to know the truth.  Ah, she said.  Young Girl, get out of my mind.  My love for you is way out of line. 
[00:51:30]  I'm much too hung, girl.  Yeah, my friend got stung, girl.  On Dateline.  Listen to this line.  Listen to this.  Your perfume and makeup.  Oh, really?  What's under there?  You're just a baby in disguise.  Oh, my God.  And though you know that it's wrong to be in love with me, 
[00:52:00]  that come on look is in your arms.  Wow.  She's blaming her.  Hey, the come on look was in her fucking eyes, Judge.  Yeah, she looked like she wanted it, Judge.  Yeah.  Better run.  Better run.  You're much too young, girl.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, it's about, you know, another one, but whatever. 
[00:52:30]  They got Jimmy's song.  I saw him that talks to Jimmy.  I did find one, too.  No, this guy's got it.  It's probably the same song you're thinking, Jimmy.  It's Jeff in Richmond.  Jeff.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  All right, brother.  Hey, Jimmy's song is Lola by the kid.  Oh, well, yeah.  I can see that.  Lola.  Oh, yeah.  We all know this one.  Yes.  Yes.  Her. 
[00:53:00]  Big-backed Lola.  It's a good song. 
[00:53:30]  Never a big Kings fan.  Me neither.  No?  No, a couple of good ones, but.  Celluloid Heroes?  Nah.  Nah?  A little over time.  That was my favorite.  Very good.  Yeah.  That's a good tune.  And they're suggesting you, well, Vince and Bayonne, Gun Guy Karaoke to a little Gary Puckett.  A little young girl with guns.  You should be doing young girls with guns.  Yeah, that'd be great.  The feds on me.  Why not?  Uh, let's say hi to Eric in Kentucky. 
[00:54:00]  Eric?  Yeah, Anthony.  There's a song called 14 by the Vandals.  One of the most underrated bands there are, and you'd love it.  Oh, yeah?  I'd love it.  You'd love it.  I've been made fun of for it for years.  Yeah?  Was it a hit, sir?  Hell no.  It was just an obscure song by them?  No, the Vandals are like a punk rock band.  They wouldn't be.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It'd be, uh.  No, I was thinking the Vandals.  Oh, the Vandals.  I swear to God.  Hey, the Vandals. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, track that down.  It's a good one.  I'm out.  All right, brother.  I thought of a song.  You got one, Jimmy?  Goodbye to Romance.  Goodbye to Romance?  By Ozzy.  Yeah, that was one.  Yeah, I had to go through the Sabbath Ozzy.  There's so many that I was like, yeah, the world.  But like speaking to me.  Help me out with the words of that one.  It's been a long time.  Yeah.  It's a lovely.  But you felt like they were talking to you?  Yeah, like it was kind of, I was the king.  I was the clown.  You know. 
[00:55:00]  Love this song.  It's great.  Reviews coming in.  One of the worst Ozzy songs ever.  It's ridiculous.  You know what?  Great tune.  And Ozzy told us that he was influenced by the Beatles.  You can hear Beatles in this song, can't you?  Yeah, definitely.  Really?  You can, right, Ant?  Yeah, yeah.  There's an influence there.  It's a great tune. 
[00:55:30]  This is fucking, he used to hang a midget to this song.  They would play this after, I think, the drum and the guitar solos.  And then Ronnie, this midget he worked with, he would just come out and sing this really  nice love song while a midget was being strung up behind him.  He had to ruin it.  He really did.  He had to make it so completely Ozzy.  He couldn't allow the song to speak for itself, right?  Yeah.  It's a good tune.  It wasn't like goodbye to romance.  What's wrong with people? 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  That was me.  Oh, yeah.  Broken Wings couldn't hold me down.  But they did.  They couldn't hold Ozzy down.  But me, they could.  I wasn't free.  I was the jester with the broken crown.  Would you sing that part extra loud if you were by yourself?  No, just think it.  Really?  I would just pensively look ahead into the distance and think it.  I'm the jester with the broken crown. 
[00:56:30]  But I was really just the fucking, the fat-titted, sexually confused boy with the fucking  bull hairdo.  Greasy-haired zilch.  Greasy-haired zilch.  Greasy-haired zilch.  Greasy-haired zilch.  Greasy-haired zilch.  That's what I was.  The virgin with a stinky belly button.  What a great fucking song, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  Damn.  Football yesterday.  I've got to be completely honest, man.  I was so bored by the Jets game.  They win or lose?  I bailed.  How are you bored by the Jets game when they're pulling off another win like that? 
[00:57:00]  The Bills.  Oh, my God.  The Bills, and even Bills fans would admit, are a real shitty team this year.  Well, it doesn't matter.  I'm embarrassed that the Bills scored 14 against the Jets.  Anything can happen.  And the Jets, again, one of my favorite team.  The one I've been following now for I can't even tell you how long.  For years, right?  Oh, my God.  Forever, it seems like.  But this is their year, and... 
[00:57:30]  3-1, baby.  I'm just bleeding jet green.  3-1.  Could easily be 4-0 at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Could easily.  Easily, yeah.  But it turned off the fucking game.  I really did.  What was the score?  38-14 was the final.  My brother called me, and I did the pumpkin thing with my young son.  My young son in the car.  Which was a waste of time, because he's pushing five months old already.  By the way.  Yeah.  It seems like yesterday I made the announcement here.  And he was asleep the whole time while we're doing hayrides and picking out pumpkins. 
[00:58:00]  Of course.  And putting our faces through the silly fucking cutouts.  The most sensible person there.  Where'd you do it?  Near my brother.  In Jersey.  Oh, that's why you were.  Okay.  In Jersey.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I rushed back just to meet you at the Greg Giraldo thing.  I went from a nice little pumpkin thing to fucking...  Ugh.  To...  Ugh.  So, did you get some good pumpkins?  Nah, we didn't grab one.  What?  I'll get mine at the supermarket.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  They're all nice and warm.  Yeah, nice.  Nice and clean for you.  No, my brother has three very young kids, so they really enjoyed it.  Walking through the maze and stuff, you know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did that whole fucking thing.  The corn maze thing.  Instead of watching the Jets, so beat me up all you want today, you know.  But we went over there, we started watching the game, and we were going to go after the  game, and then the game was, like, pretty much over very early, so...  Yeah.  Might as well get this out of the way.  Why don't we head toward the pumpkin patch? 
[00:59:00]  Phew.  There's no way.  What?  The pumpkin thing?  Yeah.  It really wasn't that bad.  But I could never imagine just walking around a pumpkin patch.  It wasn't bad.  Well, it's not even a pumpkin patch.  It's some dumb fake farmer that throws a bunch of pumpkins in a little area.  It makes believe they were growing all year.  Oh, is that it?  They weren't growing?  They're not even growing there?  I thought they were growing.  No, of course not.  All that, most of that is horseshit and fake.  Oh, my God.  What's this world coming to?  I was pissed off that the maze was so easy, but then again, I guess it's for three-year-olds, 
[00:59:30]  so...  Yeah.  Should have Nicholson chase you through with a hatchet.  How cool would that be, though, to fucking go through a real maze like from The Shining  with the big hedges?  That'd be a good one.  That would rock.  Not this fucking maze where you see over the top and see, wow, okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Actually, you couldn't even make a wrong turn.  And then I was asking my two little nieces, which way do we go?  And they're all excited.  We go this way.  And I'm thinking to myself, of course we go this way. 
[01:00:00]  There's no option.  It's just a straight line.  It's a maze with no options, because you know some dunce of a kid got fucked up somehow,  somewhere.  So now they have to have mazes with no options.  Yeah, that isn't a maze.  No.  It's just a trail that goes through.  They sort of have where you could go right, but within two feet, it's obvious that it's  a wall.  It's a dead end.  Fuck that.  When we were growing up, they fucking threw us through some mazes, right?  And you got lost a little bit.  You're crying.  Of course.  I can't get it. 
[01:00:30]  So I didn't really watch football yesterday.  What's the trick to a maze?  If you just stick to the right wall, you'll eventually get out.  Oh, yeah.  Is that really it?  Of course.  Yeah.  It might take you forever, but yeah.  Why is that the trick to a maze?  You'll run out of options.  Because you'll get through the whole maze, even if you go into the dead ends, and then  you just follow the wall of the dead end.  That's absolutely right.  You're actually going along the entire wall of the maze, so eventually it's going to bring  you back out, no matter what. 
[01:01:00]  How am I not the left one?  Probably work.  I think the left one works.  Probably work left to you.  That's the communist way.  That's right.  What are you fucking...  Fascist?  Fascist.  I'm wrong with you.  Hey, did the Cowboys play?  They were off.  They had a bye week?  Yeah.  Jets got the Vikings next, Monday Night Football.  It's a good game.  Oh, they'll win that one.  We'll fucking beat the fucking Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Which Favre's record now?  I don't even know.  How are the Vikings doing, Travis?  They're one and two.  I think they had a bye this week.  I love how much Florentine hates Favre. 
[01:01:30]  Favre's terrible this year.  Yeah, he...  He's awful.  He went one year too many.  Well, he didn't fucking go to training camp.  No, he's got two touchdowns, six interceptions,  and I've seen at least two more  that should have been interceptions,  but they were called back.  So he's...  Just having a horrible year.  Oh, he's terrible.  He finally looks like, you know,  he's 41 years old, missed training camp.  Well, it was stupid.  You're 41 years old and you missed training camp?  That's just dumb, right?  What are you...  Because he wanted the big buildup  to whether or not he'd come back. 
[01:02:00]  He's an attention whore.  And Florentine does tweet about it.  Florentine murders him.  Just kills him on a regular basis.  I love it.  Hates him.  Yeah.  Fucking baby.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're like a chick.  Stop looking for attention.  Well, you know you're coming back.  Hates...  He fucking...  I almost did Florentine.  He hates him.  He hates him.  And let's not forget about the big blue fans also.  The Giants won a game.  Oh, what was the final last night?  Giants won a game.  17-3 over the Bears, right. 
[01:02:30]  Over the Bears.  I'm not a Giants fan.  Well, some people are.  You're...  My brother is a fan of both teams.  I'm like, you gotta pick one.  I don't get that.  Like, I'm a Mets fan, sort of.  I'm not much of a baseball fan these days.  But I'm not gonna, like, now root for the Yankees  because the Mets are out of it.  No, you have to.  I'm Reds all the way.  And people confuse.  I'm like, I'm not a Phillies fan  just because I got in-laws down there.  It's the Cincinnati Reds for the title, my friends.  People, I hate when I do that.  Yankees got beat by the Red Sox.  They did that on purpose, right? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Because they wanted to play the Twins?  Yeah.  Why would you want to play the Twins away, though?  I don't know.  They'll beat him.  Huh?  They'll beat him.  Yeah.  Of course.  Because they don't want to play Cliff Lee and the Rangers.  Yeah.  Good old Cliff Lee.  Cliff Lee is dangerous.  Dangerous.  Dangerous.  Cliff Lee is dangerous.  What do you think?  Your boys are gonna do it this year, Ant?  Um, no.  No?  No?  Um, no.  It's gonna be tough.  Yeah.  But they've pulled it out like that before. 
[01:03:30]  They come to play in postseason.  Of course they do.  Most of them, anyway.  Who's the teams that are left now?  You got the Twins, you got the Reds, you got the Phillies, you got, uh, who else we got?  The Rays.  The Rays, the Yankees.  Giants and Braves.  Giants, all right.  Braves.  Yeah, there's still plenty of teams left.  Of course.  Jesus Christ.  Right.  And the Mets are gonna fire literally everybody today.  Oh my God.  They are gonna fucking clean house. 
[01:04:00]  Heads are gonna roll over there.  Yeah, but you're right.  At Citi Field.  No, they fucking sucked.  What were they, seven, eight games under 500, something like that?  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  Not good.  Yeah.  Funny thing is, Yankees were the second best team in baseball and they gotta play their  series away.  In baseball.  Not all the games away, but advantage to the Twins as far as home games go.  Yeah, we don't worry about it.  But Mets fire everybody.  You think Joe Torre goes to the Mets?  Because now it's wide open.  Jesus.  Why not fucking get Sweet Lou back in New York? 
[01:04:30]  Sweet Lou.  Fuck your dying mother.  This is some baseball to manage.  Holy cow.  Fuck your dying mother.  Wow.  What should you do first?  How long can you hold her fucking hand?  Get back in that tight fucking uniform of yours and get back to New York.  Mets need your help.  Who the Mets gonna get, you think?  You know, Joe Torre is a prospect.  Torre's always a rumor.  Possibility.  Bobby Valentine's always a rumor.  Oh my God. 
[01:05:00]  I love Bobby Valentine.  I used to love Bobby Valentine.  The funniest motherfucker ever.  With the disguises?  Yeah, when he got ejected from the game.  He will never live that down.  And he came back into the dugout wearing a fake mustache.  And glass combo.  Glasses combo.  What a tool.  Well, Torre hinted he would take the job.  And then he had to shut his mouth because he realized no one was fired yet.  Yeah.  And now everybody's gonna get fired today.  He might.  Huh?  He might get the gig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joe Torre is a Mets manager. 
[01:05:30]  I would take that.  Yeah, there's Bobby Valentine.  Bobby Valentine with his fake mustache and glasses.  Let me say hi to Brad in West Virginia.  We never hear from West Virginia.  Brad.  Hey, Opie.  I just want to say you're a dick.  Why?  The Reds haven't made the playoffs since 1995.  And now you have to battle on your sports curse.  You know, well, I gotta pick my teams every year.  He doesn't really have a sports curse anymore.  No, I think it's fixed. 
[01:06:00]  You think it's good now?  Yeah, I think you're fine.  I think I'm fine.  Especially when the Jets win the Super Bowl this year.  Then all bets are off.  Oh.  Then the sports curse will officially be over.  All right.  Let's call it that.  Jets win the Super Bowl.  Sports curse officially over.  No more sports curse.  No more sports curse.  By the way, Ant was kind of making fun of the pumpkin thing.  And Wes, the trucker, has something.  Go ahead, Wes.  Hey, Ant.  You can imagine yourself walking around a pumpkin patch, but you're perfectly fine at  a renaissance fair dressed up like a 12-year-old boy? 
[01:06:30]  I don't think I dress like a 12-year-old boy.  I dress like a distinguished gentleman of the renaissance period.  Well, you know what?  There are more things to do at a renaissance festival than there are just walking around  a pumpkin patch, sir.  Hey, man.  What about apple cider, which gives me explosive diarrhea, by the way?  I could have.  A couple sips of apple cider cleans me right the fuck out. 
[01:07:00]  I would drink some mead.  I will have a yard of mead.  Nice.  And a steak on a stick.  Steak on a steak.  Don't give me that turkey shit.  No, I don't like the turkey leg.  It's horrible.  Oh, Wally Backman.  Wally Backman?  As the Mets manager?  Yeah?  I see Wally Backman doing this?  Wally Backman?  Why not?  Throwing all the bats all over the place.  Yeah.  I don't even give a shit.  A little volatile.  I just don't give a shit about football or baseball. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  No, I do care about the Jets.  The Jets are going to have a really good year, but hockey starts up this weekend.  Hockey?  It's just finished.  Why can't hockey stop it?  I know.  They're always here.  What's wrong with hockey?  Like the sniffles.  What's wrong with hockey?  They're just too...  The season is too fucking long.  And baseball isn't?  Baseball takes a month off.  But baseball is just kind of like there, whatever.  They're playing every day.  It doesn't matter.  It's like, who cares for the first few games? 
[01:08:00]  I got to tweet the picture later.  I forgot to do it, but I'm following the Islanders on Twitter, which could be the most boring Twitter account ever.  That does sound horrible.  They had a picture of it.  Is Eric Twitter bad?  Oh, it's horrendous.  They got pictures of fans walking into the Coliseum for a pre-game.  Just stank.  Pre-season game.  I'm like, why?  Do they have a lot of followers?  Not really.  And they tweeted a picture of the Ice Girls.  Oh, are they just a bunch of pigs this year? 
[01:08:30]  Are they really?  I think the Islanders started that whole Ice Girl thing.  I really do.  I think my friend Ted, when he was working for the Islanders, was part of that.  Now he works for NASCAR.  And then the rest of the...  Oh, Team Sheckler, right?  Ted Sheckler, right.  And then the rest of the team started doing the Ice Girls coming out and scraping the  ice and sweeping up the ice instead of the old fucking Teamster guys with their buckets  to make it more of a show.  And they used to have some really fucking hot pieces of asses out there, and this year's  crop is horrendous.  Where are they?  Let's see them. 
[01:09:00]  I'll have to...  I don't even know what their account is.  Let's see the Islanders Ice Girls.  Yeah.  Horrendous.  I don't even know what their account is.  Images, all right.  See, when you Google image...  Yeah, but you're going to get all of them from past years.  Let's see.  No, this is 2010, all right?  No, it's not, because that girl on the left there is now a fat pig, because they see her  come back.  Which one?  The her?  No, the one next to her. 
[01:09:30]  The next one?  Yeah.  She's very pretty, that girl.  She was beautiful.  This was when they had all-stars, man.  That was an all-star team of Ice Girls.  That's not the current crop, I'm telling you right now.  Positive.  No.  And that other one fattened herself up.  She got pregnant.  And that's the one.  That's the one the guy tweeted.  Let me see now.  Wait a minute.  Let's see.  The one has no bottom lip.  They look a little weathered.  They're all horrendous.  They look a little weathered.  How can you be weathered if you're 19, 20 years old? 
[01:10:00]  What are they giving out?  Oh, that second one in is horrid.  Look, she's the record player from the Flintstones.  Right.  She has no bottom lip, right?  She looks like a burn victim.  Or she's Fire Marshal Bill.  Or she has no top lip.  I don't know.  Oh, she's fucking atrocious.  They tweeted that yesterday.  I'm like, really?  How about we fucking, you know, keep them hidden?  Oh, that's a shame.  Yeah.  Long Island, what's happening with the crop out there?  I don't know.  Homegrown girls from Long Island not doing as well.  Not looking as good, I guess. 
[01:10:30]  What happened?  Hey, you know what?  Just off-road one second.  I'm going to buy three Who albums I would like suggestions.  I'm going to broaden my horizons.  You made me want to buy a Who record with that.  I like Quadrophenia.  I like, Ant likes Quadrophenia.  I like Quadrophenia.  I like Who's Next.  You've got to get Who's Next.  And honestly, but this is, here we go.  I like the Tommy shit.  Oh, he'll never get Tommy.  I know.  I like the Tommy shit.  Which one is that Blue Eyes song?  Who's Next.  Okay, I'll buy that one. 
[01:11:00]  I'm going to buy that record.  Who's Next is like the one.  That was like the, they had a lot of hits.  A lot of the hits on that one.  A lot of the hits.  I should just buy the greatest hits, shouldn't I?  Honestly, if you're going Who, you might as well.  Yeah.  Yeah, but their greatest hits album, it's only like 12 songs.  What?  Yeah, it's a very short.  Give me the song list of the greatest hits.  I have to find it.  And me and Ann will help you out.  I put it.  What do you got?  I Can't Explain, My Generation.  Jimmy Hates, My Generation.  That's all right.  I like that.  All right, what else?  The Kids Are All Right. 
[01:11:30]  Substitute.  Happy Jack.  Pictures of Lily.  I Can See for Miles.  Magic Bus.  Pinball Wizard.  Behind Blue Eyes.  Nice.  Bob O'Reilly.  Nice.  Won't Get Fooled Again.  Nice.  Love Rain or Me.  Nice.  Squeeze Box.  Who Are You?  You Better, You Bet.  You don't like that song?  That was the first album after Keith Moon's death.  It's a good song.  I believe it was 1981. 
[01:12:00]  And they felt it focused more on Pete Townsend addressing his mortality.  That was pretty much what that album was about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How do you know that?  I don't know.  Did you just read that on your fucking iPad?  No, I did not.  What else?  Eminence Front.  I like Eminence Front.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  What is that?  Can you place it on?  I've been killing the Who for so many years.  I'm like, and every once in a while I'll catch a Who song.  I'll be like, yeah.  And Bill Ward loves Keith Moon so much.  I'm like, I can't just the Who.  Look at you because Bill Ward loves Keith Moon. 
[01:12:30]  That's right.  Anyone should love him.  Really fast, Danny.  Could you look up the Blackhawks ice girls?  Supposedly they're really hot.  I want to know who has the hottest fucking ice girls in the league now.  The Flyers do pretty good with their girls down there.  What do the ice girls do, though?  They just shake their asses and they bend over without.  Oh, Gregory.  They bend all the way over without bending their knees to pick up ice chips.  What are you doing with this song?  You can stop it eight minutes ago.  No, no, no.  It kicks in.  You don't like this song?  Not so far. 
[01:13:00]  It's like an abacus.  You know, we've played it as a rejoiner a lot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they don't sell just the fucking...  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  Fuck the Islanders.  I'm a Blackhawks fan.  See?  Now it kicks in.  Yeah, it's great.  There's a fucking chase scene in Freebie and the Bean.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Dude.  Look how hot the Blackhawks ice girls are compared to the Islanders.  All right.  The Islanders are a shitty fucking organization.  You don't think they're as hot as the Blackhawks girls?  What do you think? 
[01:13:30]  No.  It's not even close.  Look at the one on the right.  Look at the one far right is amazing.  Far right is ridiculous.  Yeah.  They're all crazy.  I go far right, second far right for second place, and then it's a tie.  It's really a toss-up.  Two, four, six.  There's eight solid girls right there.  And they're wearing the red leg-warming sock things going up to their knees, and their asses  are completely hanging out of their little skirts.  Oh, my God.  Now compare it to the ice girls on Long Island. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, wait.  Now we've got some single pictures.  Oh, come on.  Oh, my God.  They're on the ice in bikinis.  It's just crazy.  Shoveling with their little ice shovels.  This is great.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Punch up one of the pictures.  Get that blonde with the shovel in her hair.  Who the fuck turned me on to this?  Right there.  Let me see that one.  Oh, my God.  CD in New Jersey, you rule today.  Thank you, sir.  Let's see that one.  Look at the cleavage.  Yeah, let's see that one.  Oh, my God.  What would you do with that?  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Although that one looks like she might have a little. 
[01:14:30]  You like her gut hanging over?  It's great.  Her gut over there.  Yeah, maybe she's eating a little too many hot dogs.  Yeah, a little too many pieces of cake or something.  Yeah, Chip.  Oh, boy.  It's a raven-haired lovely.  Can we go back?  Could you go back to the Islander Ice Girls just for the comparison?  Ugh.  Yeah.  Is Quadrophenia better than Tommy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would say so.  Yeah.  Tommy's a required taste.  Required?  Acquired. 
[01:15:00]  Acquired.  Excuse me.  Sorry.  And now look at the Long Island Ice Girls with the one girl.  Oh, my God.  The one girl's missing.  There's only five of them.  Missing her.  I guess it would be her upper lip.  They're wearing their outdoor jackets.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's not even close.  Yeah, when you put them next to each other, it's hysterical.  Kings Ice Girls are smoking.  Could you go to the L.A. Kings?  L.A. Kings, yeah.  Their Ice Girls, nice.  Panthers Ice Girls, the Washington.  Everyone is.  Now everybody's saying their own city has the hottest girls. 
[01:15:30]  But now we've got to figure it out.  With hockey right around the corner, we don't have to talk about the teams.  Let's talk about their, oh, my God.  Did you see that?  A little bubblehead blondish stripper looking.  I'm not sure I dig that.  So we could either do team-by-team Ice Girls,  or we could just fast-forward straight to this link right here,  which is the 25 hottest Ice Girls of the NHL.  There we go.  Right there.  That's the obvious one.  Let's hit that.  Is this current?  I hope so.  The Islanders used to have a couple that were really good. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, this is from February of 2010.  All right, so 25 hottest Ice Girls of the NHL.  Oh, Jesus.  Start the slideshow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Christ.  I'm a pony.  25th place goes to Grace from the Dallas Stars.  What do we know about Grace there, Danny?  Anything that pops out besides the obvious?  Nah, she's a vagina that runs around on the ice.  Vagina.  All right.  Yeah, Grace is all right. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Christy from the Islanders.  Yeah, she's pretty right there.  Okay, we got one in there.  I guess they put the B team out over the weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  It was Adventureland, so, you know, you can...  Get the fuck out.  This fucking broad.  A big-titted animal.  She works for the Islanders.  She took over for your ex.  Oh, yeah?  Dina, she sucks.  Yeah, I'm not digging her.  Why do they need the chicks?  Get the fuck out of here.  You don't need them.  Ashley from Boston.  Ashley from Boston.  Oh, you know she fucks if she's from Boston, too. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  They're great.  She'll knock the crucifix off the wall and just lick your balls.  Look at Candace from the Atlanta Thrashers.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she's hot.  Danny, we're going to have to tweet this link.  No, no.  What's that?  You don't like Natalie?  No, she looks like a milk.  What about Megan and Jenna?  Yeah.  Why is there two of them together?  Oh, those are the Blackhawks.  Yeah.  Because they're just doubly as good.  Ashley from the Washington Capitals.  Wow, she looks good.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, she's pretty. 
[01:17:30]  Brittany from the Nashville Predators.  There's a little black in there, Ann.  You all right with that?  No, not at all.  Lindsay from the Nashville.  None of the hockey girls are black, by the way.  None of them are black.  Ooh.  Doris from the Jersey Devils.  Wow.  But if she'd like me, she's from Jersey.  Yeah.  As opposed to the hockey players.  Kyla from the Calgary Flames.  Sarah from the Washington Capitals.  We could win through this.  Not digging her.  Katie from the Ottawa Senators.  She's got it. 
[01:18:00]  Kaylee from the Blue Jackets.  Okay, now we go top 10.  Come on, come on.  Here we go.  Or maybe not.  10.  Ew.  Ew, what the fuck is that?  That's a mistake.  Bronwyn.  She's from the Vancouver Canucks.  Bronwyn sucks.  All right.  Get easy.  Candace from the Anaheim Ducks.  Anaheim Ducks is hot.  She's all right, man.  She likes it.  She likes the cock.  Well, I was going to say something.  Allie, Florida Panthers. 
[01:18:30]  Nice.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  On a fucking...  From the Dallas Stars.  Holy shit.  She's got goalie gear on with a bikini.  Yeah.  That's a nice look, huh?  Ridiculous.  All right.  Ridiculous.  Uh, Natasha.  Eh.  Eh, Russian.  It's all right.  Some kind of Russian.  This was a waste of time.  Jess, Boston Bruins.  All right.  We're just entertaining ourselves.  Wow, an Islander girl.  Another Islander.  Fourth place.  Allison, we'll have to look for her. 
[01:19:00]  She might have a nice clit, which scrapes on the ice.  I bet a fucking clit scrapes up ice shavings.  Yes.  Amanda.  Amanda Vanderpool.  From the Ducks.  She's a duck.  Number two.  She's a duck.  Holy shit.  Oh, okay.  Jen from the Detroit Red Wings.  Wow.  Red Wings.  Good God.  Jesus.  I wouldn't mind giving Jen a good rogering right in her ass.  I'd earn my Red Wings with her.  You know, fuck on a period.  Kendra from the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Number one ice girl in the league.  She's pretty.  She's all right.  Yeah, that's nice. 
[01:19:30]  Well, all right.  What's the third album?  Quadrophenia.  Who's next?  And what else?  What's our choices?  I said Tommy.  There's the Who Sellout.  Live at Leeds.  Live at Leeds is pretty good.  Tommy.  Mm-mm.  Endless Wire.  Mm-mm.  A Quick One.  Mm-mm.  Odds and Sodds.  Mm-mm.  No?  Mm-mm.  The Who Sings My Gen...  Oh, no.  No.  Wait.  I think you're done at, like, those two albums. 
[01:20:00]  Pretty much.  I'd go live at Leeds, maybe.  I'm missing some hits.  Not really.  That, that, my generation.  Go Greatest Hits, then.  To fill in the gaps.  You should.  Go Greatest Hits and then get those two albums.  I wasn't very happy with the Greatest Hits selection.  They're all mono versions on the fucking, uh...  Jesus.  All mono?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rich.  Rich?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hello.  Um, the, uh, you're talking about the Islander Twitter feed. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  The Jets' home opener, the first game.  Home opener?  The last play of the game with Dustin Keller, he did 10 yards and ran out of bounds after nine.  They lost the game.  Right.  And immediately, the Jets' Twitter feed, I'm sorry, the Islander's Twitter feed said,  Oh, Jets, what are you doing?  What, what was that?  And then within a minute, it was gone.  Even B.D. Galloff was like, Hey, stay classy, Jets.  Uh, uh, Islander's, the Islander Twitter feed said, Oh, uh, sorry about that.  Um, my fingers slipped.  I really shouldn't have said that.  And it was deleted right after, right afterwards.  Right. 
[01:21:00]  No idea what he was doing.  Thank you, sir.  You didn't care what that's called?  Storyteller.  Stories.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  I have to shit.  Huh?  All right, if you have to shit, we'll take a break.  No, no, but I don't know if I can.  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  Too much fog?  Too much sushi?  I ate fucking sushi by myself last night because I was so tired after, uh, I split a cab with  Kathleen Roll, who is fucking, I love, she's hilarious, she's, she's bat shit crazy.  She's a cooop.  I forgot she used to get Patrice's show with her, with him. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I forgot Kathleen did it, but I think she's really funny.  And she's smart.  She's, uh, one of those, uh, what is it, Mensa?  Oh, yeah, she is.  She's Mensa.  Isn't that an infection?  I forgot about that.  You're right, she is.  I used to be good friends with her, but then she moved to LA.  Yeah.  And, um, she's back in New York now.  It wasn't bad.  Horrible.  It's Monday, though.  Oh, the Mercer?  That's right.  I kind of liked it.  But, yeah, I forgot how smart she was.  And, um, I want to have her on the Raw Dog Show with Bob, so I was just talking to her.  And I went, I ate sushi by myself. 
[01:22:00]  I was in bed by 9.30.  I can't, I'm like a big boy.  Aw.  I slept all the way through.  Early bedtime.  Early to bed, early to rise.  All right, when we get back.  Makes the boy shits hard.  We're going to do a little Jocktober for everybody.  Yeah.  Got a little show out of Detroit we're going to beat up a little bit today.  And we got to talk about the Twilight hand model.  This, this is a very bizarre story.  Right after the break, we'll do the hand model.  And then we'll, uh, we'll move into some, uh, some, uh, Jocktober for everybody.  Okay?  Jocktober.  The O.B. and Andrew Show. 
[01:22:30]  On the virus.  It's XM.  Germany.  I'll tell you what I got.  When you tell me what you need it.  You put your money when your mouth is open.  When the shit goes on, she knows that nothing is wrong.  As shit goes down, like a sad young song. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Let's go.  I'll tell you my name, got to let me in.  You can be the sinner and I'll be the sinner.  I'll take what I want and it's easy to see.  I got everything.  Everything.  She said, show me.  I'll tell you what I got.  I'll tell you what I got.  I'll tell you what you need.  All right, Chris.  You put your money when your mouth is open.  Oh, wow. 
[01:23:30]  Another edgy, they're showing on Fox.  Another edgy thing with Christ.  Artist claims it deals with racism.  Another brave artist cartooning Christ, which is fine, but wow, way to deal with Mohammed.  You fucking faggot artists.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I would draw him either, but I'm also not drawing Christ and pretending  I'm dangerous.  Sure.  Oh, I can't stand these fucking pussy artists.  That's where Bill Donahue does make some good points.  Well.  I'm not a big fan of the Bill Donahue.  But about Islam, he's right. 
[01:24:00]  He does make some good points when it comes to that type of stuff.  It's a tough person you're going to get on your ass if you have Christ in some kind  of a perverse artwork or whatever the fuck it is.  Some Irish drunk.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill Donahue is going to fucking get on your shit.  You're pretty much safe.  Oh, wait.  No, you're not.  He's not going to lop your head off.  True.  He's just going to get your jobs.  Yeah.  He's going to have your jobs.  That was Jed coming back from break, by the way.  I didn't know that song.  That was kind of cool.  Was that off their latest album?  Is it a new song? 
[01:24:30]  We don't know.  No, that was one of their first songs.  I don't know that song at all.  Put your money where your mouth is?  Yeah.  I like it.  It's good.  Hey, Devon James claims she has sold her sex tape with Tiger Woods.  Which one was she?  Devin James was a...  Is she the one we hate the most?  To me, Jocelyn James is the one who released his text messages, I believe.  Wait, they're...  They're all pigs, as far as I'm concerned.  And did you guys know that Tiger Woods has an older brother who is speaking out?  Lion. 
[01:25:00]  They said he's lion.  Oh, look at Rocky Dennis.  Oh, Devon James is pretty hot.  Yeah.  And she didn't really...  She wasn't a jerk about the whole thing like that other one, Jocelyn.  Well, now she's being a jerk.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  She released a sex tape.  Ian Halperin said it on our show that there was a sex tape out there, and no one picked  up on the fact when he was talking about it on our show.  What the...  Because we have no credibility, I guess.  Oh, she's a pig.  Thick and...  Her body's a pig. 
[01:25:30]  I'd fuck her, though.  She'd probably be a great pig.  Matronly.  She shouldn't be bending over like that.  Too much shit fucking hangs down.  So what is this...  She's more of a girl that's got to be arching her back.  Yeah, like that.  Even laying on her back, she doesn't look good for her.  Better than that other shot that Danny found.  Where's the Perkins waitress?  Love the Perkins waitress.  What do you think she's up to?  Oh, no.  No, I love her because she really didn't fucking capitalize.  She went back to fucking...  Slinging hash.  Slinging hash.  Yep.  Tiger Perkins, he wrote. 
[01:26:00]  That's probably a guy.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  She's just the worst piece of white fucking trash.  He just fucked her because that was a power move.  Like, he met with his wife, and he saw that she was giving him eyes, and he just sent  over a note, and he knew he could fuck her.  Like, that's great.  Yeah.  You know what?  Yeah, you think that's what went down there?  Well, I think that's how it would be with me.  Tiger seems to be a perv.  I bet you she was the best lay.  Yeah.  I bet you she was the best fucking lay out of all of them.  Yeah, even though she's...  Not the best to look at, but she did some dirty things, and...  I think he fucked her in a truck or something. 
[01:26:30]  I think he shoved her fucking head in the toilet bowl and did it from behind.  Wow.  He probably did it.  He probably shitting it first.  Made her eat her way out of danger.  Fucking log.  What?  So, what are we going to...  Any details on what is in this tape?  No.  Like, what's in it?  I don't know.  Besides just fucking...  A lot of fucking...  Big black cock and a woman.  What else do you need?  I don't know.  It's supposed to come out in November, and the website is supposedly going to launch next  week, I think.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How is that fucking legal? 
[01:27:00]  How is that legal when Tiger Woods is not...  I don't understand how you can do that.  How can you fucking secretly tape somebody?  Her mother doesn't believe it, by the way.  Oh, really?  She says that she's a pathological liar.  Oh, she's the pathological liar.  Yeah.  Look at this mess.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  Tippi Thomas fucking...  A young Tippi Tom.  Hey, that's not bad, right?  No, she's definitely juicy.  So if she's a liar, maybe they're just trying to get Tiger to pay some money, not knowing 
[01:27:30]  if the tape exists.  Yeah, they're not saying, like, what production company bought it.  It's like Randy Quaid's fucking her.  I've heard vivid.  It wouldn't...  By the way, it wouldn't have taken this long to come out.  You would never have waited a year.  They would have had that out in January or February when it was still...  Are you thinking funny?  Well...  I think so.  Yeah, she's come across as, like, kind of a liar, so we'll have to wait and see on that  one.  Her mother might just hate her because she does porn, though.  But fucking Tiger has an older brother that he hasn't talked to in years, and he was talking 
[01:28:00]  about, you know, Tiger recently.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What do you say about him?  Why doesn't he talk to him?  I don't know why.  I have no idea.  I didn't even know he had an older brother.  But Tiger's father, you know, had a kid with, you know, someone else.  So it's like a half-brother or something, biologically speaking, anyway.  And this Tiger's older brother's daughter is one of the best amateur golfers in the country.  Pretty fucked up. 
[01:28:30]  Tiger's older daughter.  Oh, a junior.  Tiger's brother's...  Yeah.  Right.  Tiger's half-niece.  Can we get a picture of this guy?  Tiger Woods' brother.  Tiger's half-niece is a good golfer.  Earl Woods?  No.  Yeah, it might be Earl Woods Jr.  Ah.  It might be, I think.  Yeah, that's who it is.  Okay.  Earl Woods Jr.  Is, um...  Wow, there's just no pictures of this guy.  No, huh?  Huh.  But I guess he hasn't talked to Tiger in like six or seven years, so... 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, why would you talk to the greatest golfer on the planet when he's your brother?  Yeah.  I'd be doing nothing but saying nice stuff to Tiger.  Maybe he's cock-blocking him.  A little fucking weird, right?  All right.  You want to talk about this hand model, and then we'll move into some Jocktober?  What's going on with the hand model?  This was in the paper yesterday, and Travis has brought it to our attention.  It's a great story.  Twilight.  Model seeks glory.  Kimbra Hickey wants some recognition for her pinky-sized role in the Twilight phenomenon.  Hers are the slender, ghostly hands cupping a red apple. 
[01:29:30]  Maybe we can get that picture.  On the now-famous cover of the first hit book by, uh, Stephanie Meyer.  That picture, Ant?  That's a hand model, obviously, right?  Yeah.  Holding a fucking apple?  Uh, but Hickey's lack of fame has her cracking her knuckles in frustration.  Ugh, they have to do this.  Uh, it was...  Oh, they gotta make fucking...  Yeah, hand jokes.  It was major exposure from my hands, said the petite 40-year-old model, but nobody knew who I was.  That's her hands on the cover of the book holding an apple. 
[01:30:00]  Who cares?  Uh, so Hickey now stops anyone she sees reading the book to inform them of her contribution.  She's a kook!  Who's this again?  I'm sorry.  Uh, Kimbra Hickey.  She's a hand model that they use for the cover of the Twilight book.  I see people reading it on the subway, and I say, hey, those are my hands.  I'm a hand model.  Who gives a fuck?  I'm sure they think I'm crazy, a crazy lady on the subway, but those are my hands.  Then jerk me off with them so I can brag.  How about you grab my balls like that apple, and you fucking stroke them onto that famous wrist. 
[01:30:30]  Gives a turkey.  Uh, the good-natured Hickey sometimes hangs out near the cash register at the Barnes & Noble,  near her Greenwich Village apartment, to spread the word.  She's a kook.  What a needy fucking bitch.  Let's see her face.  Surprise customers sometimes ask her for her autograph.  Ah!  Or to trace the outline of her hand on the book jacket.  I would do that, and then fucking take my fist.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Why would you?  How embarrassing. 
[01:31:00]  She even carries around a gala apple in her purse at times, so she can recreate the pose for people.  No way.  Nobody gives a fuck.  No one cares.  Is this a me, me, me situation?  It's just how pathetic.  Like, look, any one of us would try to get hand.  Here's how you do it.  You bring up Twilight in conversation, and then you somehow go like, yeah, the book, oh, well, you know.  What?  You don't stand there and beg.  What the fuck is Mars pointing out my phone for?  What?  Oh, she's pretty.  We're in the middle of talking about a hand model. 
[01:31:30]  Mars, what?  What?  I didn't get anything.  I thought this was yours.  What are you doing?  Just for the people at home, Mars is, like, outside of the glass studio here, about 20 feet down the hall, like, making a commotion and pointing at his phone, a BlackBerry, like, and usually people do that, like, Kenny or somebody, like, check your BlackBerry, I got something for the show or whatever. 
[01:32:00]  He thought he had my phone, and now he's walking.  What is he doing?  Can you come back and explain, at least?  I don't.  We're talking about the hand model.  I would love to just, I would love that hand to cradle my dick in balls.  Gently.  All right, so, wow, he took us right out.  She, um, sorry, where were we?  So she carries around the apple in her purse at times so she could recreate the pose for people. 
[01:32:30]  She's no Ray McKigney, I'll tell you that much.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld.  Hand model.  Yeah.  The hand model episode.  Tragic story.  Why?  Well, he was the biggest fucking most famous hand model ever.  Beautiful hands.  Milky white.  Tragic story.  It was too big of a deal just to let it be, she said.  Claws.  Fucking bent up claws by the time he was done. 
[01:33:00]  You never saw the hand model episode of Seinfeld.  Same as the puffy shirt one.  Not a fan of Seinfeld.  Not a non-fan either.  I just literally just never watched it.  I mean, I don't, the moments I've seen or the episodes I've seen, they've been funny.  Yeah.  Good show, sure.  It was too big of a deal just to let it be, she said, although she admitted that she has  become a little goofy about the whole thing.  Hickey is a massage therapist who works a few days each month as a parts model.  Wow.  A parts model.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  So it's feet, hands.  Oh, yeah.  Elbows.  I had a clit.  Clit.  I still do have a, I said a had, but I still have a cousin who went down to Miami and he  was approached to be a hand model.  For real.  Really?  Yeah.  He goofed about it and obviously never fucking did it.  But he was approached to be a hand model.  Like, are there people out there just studying hands?  That are looking on.  And then they pull you aside and say, hey.  Great.  Uh, it's her six, it's her, oh, it's her size six feet, not her hands, that land her 
[01:34:00]  most of the modeling gigs.  Her tootsies have graced a Times Square billboard in the cover of magazines.  I'm still reading about this, Brun.  Where's her feet?  Uh, I never see myself as having perfect hands, she explained.  I guess I'm just lucky that they photograph well.  Hickey's agent, she's got an agent, said her hands are in demand because they are veinless,  not the sort of hands a vampire would like.  Oh.  The 2004 photo shoot for the Twilight book cover paid $300, the industry standard, for 
[01:34:30]  two hours of work.  Hickey had to file her nails extra short so her tiny hands didn't look like an adult's.  Lately, she's been going to Twilight fan conventions.  Oh my God.  She's at one this weekend in Portland, Oregon, where she sells apple-scented hand lotion.  No!  This chick is just all about that fucking apple.  Apple-scented hand.  Who wants to buy that from you? 
[01:35:00]  Enough of you and your dumb hands and your stupid apple.  I so wish it was a log she was holding so she'd have to sell like duty.  Shit-scented fucking soap.  How great is that?  Oh my God.  Wow.  So far she knows of four twee-hards.  What's a twee-hard?  As the vampire romance fans are called.  Okay.  Who've gotten tattoos of her hands.  Stop it.  You want me to keep reading it?  Those people should be fucking put away.  Her goal is to break into acting. 
[01:35:30]  She's trying to contact the casting director for the fourth installment in the Twilight series.  Just because she was a hand model.  Now she wants to be in the movie.  Nobody wants to see you in the movie.  What are they going to do?  Just walk by?  Oh, there's old apple hands McGillicuddy.  Who wants to see your fucking apple-y hands?  I hope there's a worm on her fingers.  Stupid.  If I could get a little background part, it would be fantastic, she said.  Even if they only wanted my hands in it.  They should.  You have to finger the ass of two vampires while they're in their home dirt. 
[01:36:00]  Fucking idiot.  They're home dirt.  Whatever it is vampires do.  I'm sick of them.  We get it.  You're hungry.  I got some blood.  I heard you.  Go to the fucking butchers.  How great is it that she wants to be more, and the reality is she's just massaging big,  fat, sweaty backs all day long.  Oh, she's probably a legit masseuse.  Oh, and you know every time she's massaging somebody, she goes, you know, let me tell 
[01:36:30]  you something.  You know what hands are touching you right now?  Ugh.  You think you have to pay?  Do you know the book and the picture and the apple?  No.  How much do you want to bet she pays extra because of that?  I mean, she charges extra.  Now brush the side of my nut sack with your fucking knuckle.  Exactly.  Put your fucking, put your undead fingers into my rump so I can shoot some undead semen  on my stomach.  Cup your hands and hold my ball bag in there.  Exactly.  Like it's a small, stinky apple.  Hold my balls like it's an onion. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I got some onion-scented lotion on my nuts for you.  I got your apple right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go, Mike.  If you want to follow her on Twitter, she's terrific.  It's Hands of Twilight.  What's some of the tweets she's got up there, Danny?  Let's see.  Is it just all about-  Today I clapped.  Today I played shuffleboard.  Was busy typing on my keyboard.  I was snapping on the subway, and so I rubbed sleepyheads out of my eyes. 
[01:37:30]  I did, here's the church, here's the steeple.  Open the door and see all the people.  Yes.  Oh, rang someone's bell and got recognized by a passerby.  Imitated Fonzie's A.  Was drinking some water out of the faucet and realized, oh my God, this is the Twilight  cover.  I hitchhiked. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, her friends have had enough.  I was waving toodaloo to people I don't even know.  Gave the A-OK to a stranger, asked for my autographs, shook a shook at a kitten.  Oh my God.  Cut a meat fart and was waving it at somebody, and they recognized my hand.  No one recognizes your hands.  I've never wanted something to get caught in a meat grinder so badly. 
[01:38:30]  Oh God.  By the sleeve.  She is such a no-pot.  Did she have to fucking hold the apple with one hand?  Oh, it's just fucking pulverized.  Sell the lotion 50% off.  Guys, seriously, I think we should talk to her today.  What do you think?  I would love to.  I think we should talk to her today.  She's in the news, and we'll call her.  Yeah, we'll get her, I'm sure.  I want to know everything about Twilight and her hands and apples.  Oh, God love her.  Yeah.  Oh, I bet she can talk you fucking crazy. 
[01:39:00]  Talk your ear off about that apple and the hands.  What happened to the apple?  Funny story.  What happened to the apple?  How important was the apple for the photo?  I wonder if she had to look for an apple just like that and told the person.  I bet she was holding the apple as she cupped in her hands, hoping the register girl would go.  It's like the cover of Twilight.  Oh, funny you mention it.  Ho, ho, ho.  Shut up.  Tweak my nipple with that while I jerk off.  Could you tweak my nipple with your fucking vampire fingers? 
[01:39:30]  I hope sometimes she wipes her ass and misses and gets some shit on her finger and the smell doesn't go away for a week.  Her meal tickets, as she calls them.  You think she panics?  Oh, totally.  She gets duty on her fingertips?  Have to.  Because it breaks through the toilet paper.  How funny would it be if she was tying her shoes in a semi-rander handover?  Because she's an environmentalist.  Hey, how's this Ryder Cup going, man?  We're getting spanked, aren't we?  The good old U.S. of A. 
[01:40:00]  This is the last tournament of the year, right?  A little team play.  I like to give her the treatment like in Casino when they found those two guys cheating.  You can have the apple or you can walk out of here.  You can't get both.  You can't have both.  Go at Pope of Grand Village.  Hammer.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  Yeah, that's another good one.  Do a little of that to her.  Why did they cut his thumb off?  He owed money or something?  Bedbug Eddie.  Yeah.  What was his name?  Bedbug Eddie was the bad guy.  So they were foreshadowing bedbugs way back then?  Well, yeah, they called them Bedbug Eddie. 
[01:40:30]  Bedbug Eddie.  God, you have a great fucking memory.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember I used to love that movie, and I couldn't even tell you what the movie was about now.  It's a good movie.  Mickey Rourke.  Yeah.  Becoming a big star.  A big star.  She wants recognition for her hands.  Dummy.  Yeah.  I mean, God bless her, but come on.  What bothers me is to hang out at the counter.  That's creepy.  And just seek approval.  Yeah.  Because you know the counter people are tired of her. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yes.  It was interesting for the first three seconds.  Like, I bet you she told a couple of people, and one guy was like, oh, cool.  And then the black girl was like, all right, then.  The black girl didn't care.  All right.  I hope there's a fan out there, I'm just saying, where you run into this broad, and you ask her  to, like, sign the middle of the book so it's open nice, and actually sign, and you  slam that fucking...  You just slam a giant dictionary closed on her fucking fingers.  Or just ask her the story.  Say, so exactly what, you know, you're the what? 
[01:41:30]  And then she starts to tell her, just go, I heard you.  We're going to get her on the air, though, right?  We've got to get her on the air.  I hope so.  We really need to get her on the air.  Voicemail, that's good.  She'll call us back.  Of course we could be mean to her.  How'd you get her number?  How?  Really?  We're good.  How are you getting pissed? 
[01:42:00]  That's what I want to see those hands holding.  A good, a pungent asparagus piss.  And then she has to sell fucking asparagus piss lotion.  Gee, I wonder who should I buy some apple butter from.  The lady who held one on the photo.  It's great.  That's like the fucking sailor who kissed that fucking nurse selling nurse hats.  Nobody wants to see them.  No one cares.  Yeah, look, here's me.  And he kips forward like he's kissing somebody.  Nobody gives a turkey, shit face. 
[01:42:30]  Nobody wants to see.  Take different photos with your hands.  That's what I want to see.  Here's my hands with a black dick in them.  Here's my hands holding a vial of AIDS blood.  You know?  That's what I would like.  Here's my hands holding a Zeppo Marx portrait.  Just weird stuff.  Nobody wants to see you holding an apple.  Is that a little massaging going on?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I want to see. 
[01:43:00]  Hold a cock.  Hold that cock.  That cock.  Hold that cock.  We're calling her and calling her.  I thought we had her.  She's in Portland.  That's three hours different, so she's probably in bed.  Oh, she's at the twilight thing.  They're not this early.  No, Portland's three hours, bro.  I know, but she's doing the twilight thing.  I know, but they're all vampires.  They go to bed in the day.  She's probably got her hands wrapped up.  She's in bed sleeping with her arms straight out.  I want to know that.  Her hands wrapped with lotion in there.  Lotion and foil.  Yeah, yeah.  Constantly.  Don't hurt them.  She wraps them like Luca Brasi's vest so bed bugs don't nibble her nails and wreck her career. 
[01:43:30]  That's all she needs is bed bug feces on her nail.  How bad do you want to just bend her fingers back one by one?  Oh, great.  I want to suck them with morning breath so she has to smell them all day.  I don't want to hurt her hands.  I just want to lick them with morning breath tongue.  I just want to jam them.  Just throw basketballs at her until she catches them wrong.  Oh, I can't think.  Make her catch a football in cold weather.  Yeah, exactly.  Ow.  I hope she scrapes her knuckles on the concrete. 
[01:44:00]  Well, she's, you know.  She's a vampir.  Yes.  And I know you're a huge fan of Jersey Shore and Sam brought in a special clip for you and  I just want to play it.  It's a quickie.  Oh, I love it.  Big fan that you are.  It's T-shirt time?  12-10 is T-shirt time.  It is 12-10.  It's T-shirt time.  T-shirt time. 
[01:44:30]  It's T-shirt time.  Hey, everybody knows it's T-shirt time.  So nice.  T-shirt time.  It's T-shirt time.  Oh, my God.  Shut up now.  I'm just trying to let everybody know so they put their T-shirts on.  There you go.  Huge ratings for that show.  Just huge fucking ratings.  What show is it?  What the fuck was that?  You don't know T-shirt time?  What's T-shirt time?  The guys, they hang out, right?  They hang out in their shirts before the T-shirts. 
[01:45:00]  Shirt before the shirt.  So they're all showered and ready to go out, but they're hanging out in their T-shirts.  And then they take that shirt off and put the shirt on that they're actually going out in.  As Sam said, it's the shirt before the shirt.  The shirt before the shirt, right.  Kenny.  G.H., I don't mean to correct you.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I believe they wear, like, Guinea T-shirts.  Yeah.  Yeah, the shirt before the shirt.  Right.  Underneath, they iron their club T-shirt. 
[01:45:30]  Uh-huh.  And then what?  When it's T-shirt time, they put their dress T-shirt on over the Guinea T-shirt.  Over the Guinea T?  Get Sam in here, because now I'm going to have to correct you.  See, even after they're showered and fresh, they're already starting to sweat and shit.  So they wait for the last second, take that shirt off, and then put on a fresher shirt to go out in.  Look, they're taking their shirts off.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy.  No, no. 
[01:46:00]  See?  See?  Yeah.  I stand corrected.  You're right.  Sam, am I right?  Of course you are.  Yeah.  Because they want the freshest possible shirt as they're leaving the house.  Kenny's wrong.  Hey, does Pauly D, you're one of those douchey fucking DJs over on Hits, right?  What do you mean?  I have a show on Hits 1, yes.  And did I hear, because I do listen to that channel from time to time.  I'll bet you do.  Everybody does.  Does Pauly D have a fucking song on Hits 1?  Beat that beat up.  On Hits 1?  Yeah, beat that beat up. 
[01:46:30]  Beat that beat up?  Yeah.  It's like, remember when we were talking?  It's horrible.  Remember when we were talking about fist pumping, how you're fighting against the beat?  Right.  That's what he's doing.  Beat that beat up.  But it's on Hits 1, eh?  I can't.  They take their music very serious over there.  Yeah.  They only play 20 songs, and if they're going to add a new one to the rotation, they have  to really think about it.  Well, here's the song.  Sounds real original. 
[01:47:00]  This is every piece of shit fucking song that I can't have heard.  This is great.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I guess it's supposed to start like.  You build it up.  Oh.  This is DJ Pauly D. 
[01:47:30]  Being a Guido's a way of life.  Ooh.  I don't represent all Italians.  I represent myself.  I started this whole GTL shit.  Chim, tan, and laundry.  You gotta stay fresh to death.  It's time to.  Yeah.  You're doing it.  Like, um.  Like, um.  Like, um.  Like, um.  Like, um.  Like, um.

[01:48:30]  So if you're trying to get into my DJ group  And you're trying to come home with me  DJ Pooly D  Then you and your friends better come correct  There'll be no grenades tonight  It's time to  Oh!  This is so fucking bad  I like this  It's so embarrassing  Come correct  Are we just too old to understand? 
[01:49:00]  Are you getting a lot of requests for this dumb song there, Sam?  Um, I think that if this song was not associated with a cast member of the Jersey Shore  It would not be getting quite as much radio play  Alright, at least you're honest, thank God  I'm gonna get your fucking shine box  Exactly  Yeah  What's that, Ronnie?  Oh, God  T-shirt time  Hey, Steve in New York is saying that 
[01:49:30]  They took my thumb, Charlie's  From the  From the Hustler  And not the Pope of Greenwich Village  Get the fuck out of here  Come on  It's the Pope of Greenwich Village  Do they  Do that line in  The Hustler, too?  No, they break his hands, I believe  Or break his fingers  They break it  They don't  They don't take his  Steve  Huh?  They break both of his thumbs at the end of the movie  Okay, yes  They break his thumbs  They don't  Cut his thumb off  In the Pope of Greenwich Village, they cut his thumb off  And they  And it's Eric Roberts, right?  Yeah  Eric Roberts with that famous line  They took my thumb, Charlie  What's wrong with you? 
[01:50:00]  I realize I'm totally not relevant anymore  Because you went into the whole thing about those douches on the  No, don't try to get out of it  Don't try to get out of it  You fucked up  You couldn't be a runner  You stink  Well, you know, everything that's wrong with the world is guys like me  You guys like the Jersey Shore  With Geraldo doing clubs  When he, you know  It's just not at all entertaining  Hmm?  Thank you  Alright, brother  Thank you  Thank you  Oh, did you see the  I watched Jersey Shore  Did you see where Snooki had to clean up the room where they all fuck? 
[01:50:30]  The smush room?  The smush room  Yeah, that's where you're going to smush  Yeah, smush  So she had to clean all the jizz up so she could bang some dude  Well, it was cute  She got in a little plastic bag  Was it cute?  With a head cut out  And her and JWoww had to clean up the smush room  Because she was going to smush  Was there, oh, did she smush?  Anything in her bath  Use condoms and all sorts of crap in the, what?  Smush room  The smush room  Where people go to smush  Scraping dry jizz off the walls  If you're going to bring a girl back and you're trying to smush 
[01:51:00]  Or, let's not be sexist here  If the girls meet a guy and they want to smush  You're not going to do it in like, you got roommates and stuff  You just go into the smush room  Some people call it a guest room  But it's not meant for guests  It's meant for smushing  You don't watch this show, huh?  No  I am not watching the shirt before the shirt  Shirt before the shirt  I'm not watching  T-shirt time  You're not a GTL guy  I'm not a T-shirt guy 
[01:51:30]  I'm not a GTL guy  You see when they put a used tampon under, or a used maxi pad under Angelina's pillow?  Why?  Because she threw it out in the garbage, but it was on the floor  And the situation was trying to bring a girl back, obviously, trying to smush  And he had to clean up because it was so dirty  And one of Angelina's pads was used and on the floor, so he put it under her pillow  That's great  She was pissed, man  Did the cunt fairy come and leave her money? 
[01:52:00]  What's the going rate for that?  Yeah, I don't know  It depends on how old you are  A quarter or a buck  Unbelievable  Well, there you go  And Angelina left the show, I guess  Yeah  For the second time  Yeah  Had a good fight with Snook  The Snookster  They've already, I mean  Snooki's disgusting  You don't like her?  Oh, God, no  She's a fucking tree trunk  Shilled in a fucking black dress 
[01:52:30]  Awful, awful, horrid girl  Some of our listeners are big fans of Snooki  I was thinking more of a tree stump  Yeah, just like a stomp  Just one of those stumps  She is  Just pick up a stump  Tree stump  Fire plug  Throw it in a black dress, you got Snooki  And put some wacky hat and fucking glasses on it  Snooki's the worst  Alright  Are we ready for Jacktober?  How could we not be?  Clear the field  Take a little break  And then do a little Jacktober 
[01:53:00]  I wish I could  Clear the field  I really  I'm afraid it's going to be one of those sideways ones  What do you mean sideways?  It's like logged  It's like I can feel it all the way up to the  You can feel it sideways  The tip of it is actually bumping my heart  Too much tuna last night  Yeah, it's going to be a horrible  Did you go with the tuner special?  No, I go with the Osaka  Or Okasa  Which is everything  Yeah  They gave me some oyster sushi  Oh  Yeah  Fuck, was it good  Was it good?  I ate sushi by my lonesome 
[01:53:30]  Look at that  She's being arrested  I'm looking at a picture  That's when she was really fucking wasted  And she is disgusting  She really is  Look at the gut on her  The bunt  She's only going to get worse  Those midget fucking fat legs  I'd still smush  No smushing  I'd fuck her  I would smush  Yeah  You know the smell coming out of her ass  Is not good  What do you think that smells like, Jimmy?  Ass  But not sexy ass  But like a man's ass 
[01:54:00]  Just wafts up at you  When you're doing it from behind  I bet her ass smells like Rogan's  After an MMA workout  Quite similar  Yeah  See that's kind of  She has a fat little rump  I would put my dick in her  Smush  Oh smush  Snooki looks like a thumb with a face  Some guy from North Carolina saying  Yeah  That's another great example  A thumb with a face  Alright  Disgusting  We'll take a break  And we're going to get right into Jocktober 
[01:54:30]  After the break  We got a good show today, Sam?  We will have a good show  No, I mean a good show  We're beating up for Jocktober  Every day  Well, tease this  What are we going to hear here?  Well, we're going  A little more towards the Midwest area of the country today  Okay  Like the Northern Midwest  To Detroit, Michigan  And by the way  I've been going through the Jocktober requests  Uh-huh  In my email  There are a lot of Jocktober-worthy shows in Detroit  Really? 
[01:55:00]  A lot  Yeah  We may have to revisit Detroit once more  In the month of Jocktober  No problem there  Is that Snooki's ass?  Yeah  Because it is horrible  I said it looks like an elephant's ass  Yeah, I said that a while ago  She has the ass within the ass  Yeah, it's like the shirt before the shirt  She has the ass before the ass  It's like an ass  And then in the middle where the crack is  Is a whole nother ass  It hangs down way too low for her age  It is long  Shouldn't that be propped up a little bit better? 
[01:55:30]  She's not that old, right?  What is she?  35?  No, she's not in her 30s  35  There it is  You know how the elephant's ass has that  Yeah  That hanging shit  That hanging shit  There are rumors of a certain reality show  Being formulated right now  Where JWoww would make appearances  And it would be Snooki's show  Snookin' for Love  May be a real thing  Jesus Christ  Enough already  If there's a show called Snookin' for Love  She can't find her ideal guido  Yes, she can't, can she? 
[01:56:00]  She can't  Snookin' for Love on what channel, though?  Probably MTV  MTV wants to just keep going  And they've been dropping hints  They just, on a recent episode  She had her list of qualities she was looking for in a man  She's always looking for someone  This really seems to me to be the ideal situation  I can't wait  No pun intended situation  Of course  I bet there's a lot of guests dropping in on Snookin' for Love  Snookin' for Love  Only if it really happens, it's reality TV 
[01:56:30]  Hey man, if no one was looking, would you stick your dick in that?  Oh god, it's an elephant's asshole  Elephant ass, no  Because elephants can rampage  You never fuck anything in the ass that can run through a fence  My father taught me that at a young age  Sat me down and said, there's one thing you need to know  Wise man  Never fuck an animal that can run through a fence  Dude, would you smell that?  Oh god, it looks so bad  No  You wouldn't smell that?  How about sticking your tongue in there  And just cleaning the whole ring 
[01:57:00]  It's dripping with shit  So what?  Elephants can't wipe their ass  Of course they can't  They're busy running over things  They're busy stepping on toes  They're busy being big  That's why they have that leathery skin  It probably cakes up on the back  And small birds eat it off  Oh, probably  Why doesn't  Caked up fucking elephant shit  Why doesn't animal shit smell as bad as human shit?  Oh, it's horrible  No, it's not that bad  Dude, it's fucking terrible  It's really not that bad  When you go to a zoo or something  Central Park South  Where they did the horses 
[01:57:30]  They eat hay  Their diet's different too  It's all hay  I'm not saying it's fantastic or anything  But it's not that bad  So it's easier  Easier to take than like  Dog shit's pretty rough  Oh, it likes animal duty  Ew  It's anything that's meat eater  If it's a vegetarian  Like an elephant or a horse  Right  Then it's just, you know  Canary  But anything that's canary  Bed bug  Anything that eats meat  It just stinks  That's when it starts getting horrendous smelling  Yeah 
[01:58:00]  Alright  Sam, stay close  Jacktober next  We go to Detroit  Stay there  We'll be an Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM  Hey baby  Red boots  And you gotta believe me  I saw her  I saw her  With my own two eyes  Oh, right now  Playing this for Jimmy  But Jimmy's in the bathroom 
[01:58:30]  Yeah  He might be doing that shitting thing  He was talking about  Taking that  That big dump  The old big dump  Well, we can start Jacktober without Jimmy, huh?  Alright  Did you see him in the bathroom?  Was he...  No, I did not see him in the bathroom  Oh, boy  Probably one of them stalls  Yeah, there was piss on most of the toilet seats again this morning 
[01:59:00]  I don't know what kind of animals are in there  This isn't a fucking subway station  I went to just go in there to blow my nose  And I went to just grab some toity paper  Yeah  And every stall I walked into is just  Glistening  Disgusting  It glistens  Piss and shit  I don't get it, man  Just fucking savage animals  You see that in some of the fucking train stops or whatever  Yeah  If you have to really go badly  But not here  Why here?  It's angry people  Yeah  I don't blame them, but 
[01:59:30]  They really are  Just nasty angry people  Actually, you know what?  I understand  Shit on the walls  I get it  I'm with you  A lot of angry people around here  Oh, God  Yeah, like, why?  That's wonderful  Dan is showing us where there's a log  Just on the fucking rim of the toilet seat  And then it's just hanging off the side  How do you miss like that?  Like, why?  What is going on in your life that you have to do that?  And the toilet is just full of toilet paper  Yeah 
[02:00:00]  I've seen this one before  This is, I guess, is the original picture  But the one that I had seen  It was this with a caption that said  The Great Escape  Yeah  Which makes it ten times fun  That's good  Oh, you think maybe it overflowed  And it just kind of started  No, I don't care  Obviously  It just looks like the turd is escaping  Obviously the world we live on  People would set up a picture like that now  But we've seen it in real life  Oh, yeah, yeah  Where you walk into a stall  And there's stuff on the walls  No reason  What is that red stuff that was all in there? 
[02:00:30]  What is that?  That just doesn't look good at all  Oh, right  Come on  Like somebody vomited  Get the fuck out of here  Oh, maybe some hurricanes  Too many hurricanes  Oh  Fairies wear boots there, Jordan  What's the name of the Sabbath song?  Ah  All right  Where's our Jocktober intro?  Let's get into this, man  Jocktober  Is that a new intro for Jocktober? 
[02:01:00]  I like it  That's a good one  Who's the new voice guy?  He's pretty good  Jake Chubber 
[02:01:30]  Sam, what do we got today for Jocktober?  Well, today we head down to Detroit  Or up  I don't know  It depends on where you are  To Detroit, Michigan  To WDVD  And Blaine and Allison in the morning  Oh, a woman  Well, yeah  Well, Blaine  Allison is kind of there  Oh, boy  Are we going with the couple show?  Are they married?  Do they make me believe they're married?  What's the sexual tension between these two? 
[02:02:00]  No  Blaine is married with a kid  Or two kids  Okay  And Allison is with a man  Okay  No kids, but four dogs  Oh  Oh, crazy  Oh, boy  What's going on with Allison?  And there's also  There's Dana, the traffic lady  And she kind of sits in, too  Because she, you know  What kind of music do they play?  Oh, boy  Does it hit music and more?  They play today  What's their slogan?  Today's best hits without the rap  Is actually their 
[02:02:30]  Which I think is racist  But that's their slogan  Well, obviously raps are something Allison isn't eating, either  Because  I mean, she's heavier than some  Oh, wow  She is  My goodness  She's a bit hefty, huh?  Yeah  And when we listen to Blaine  Let's just say his cadence  And maybe opinions and things  Would not lead you to immediately think  That he's married with children  Oh, really?  Oh  This is who we're looking at today for Jacktober  What do you think, Jimmy? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, nice, folks  It's a happy, comfortable smile  Is that  What?  Is that a hair system?  Yeah, doesn't that look like he's kind of wearing  Like one of the bad hair systems?  Just  Yeah  No, the  Hair Club for Men  System  Yeah  The one that they fucking mesh  It's a mesh thing they put on your head with glue  Yeah, it sure is a mesh  Looks like somebody made a mesh on the guy's head with hair or something  It was working  So I said it  And the teeth look photoshopped white 
[02:03:30]  Do you think so?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah, they are  Oh, yeah  What's her fucking problem?  She's fat  There's so much going on there  All right, there you go  She's fat  There's something going on with the schnaz  She's got a witch's nose  She's got, like, crazy chick eyes  Her dogs don't seem to mind, though  She's got four dogs  What's that about, Sam?  She's a dog person  She loves animals  That's a lonely girl  Why is she lonely, though?  Well, she's got a baby daddy 
[02:04:00]  Who  But no babies  They're dogs  She refers to the dogs as the babies  Oh, that's adorable  What's her peanut butter, Bill?  And then from the size of her  It looks like she's doing a one for you, one for me  With the dog  With the peanut butter, you mean?  Yeah, of course  Maybe the dog's getting a little sump  He rubs it on himself  She sucks his little red lipstick dick  Sucks the milky brown peanut butter off of it 
[02:04:30]  I don't think this is fair to say about Allison  Just guessing  She's trying to do a radio show  We're just speculating  Oh, okay  Based on her size  Yeah  And the fact that she has four dogs  Yeah  A lot of times, big fat cells with dogs, you know  Yeah  Suck their dicks  They suck their dog's dicks  Out of courtesy  Because they know what it's like to be lonely  What kind of dogs does she have?  I don't know  I haven't seen pictures  Embarrassed ones  Well, Jacktober 
[02:05:00]  With Blaine and Allison on WDVD in Detroit  We start with a taste of Blaine  Who's promoting a gig between songs  He definitely sounds like a man who's married  And has two kids  And not a possible closeted homosexual  Jesus  Yes  I said that he doesn't sound like a closeted homosexual  He sounds straight  He sounds like just a guy who's got kids  Of course  Yeah  Just a knock-around guy  Yeah, you'd hang out with him 
[02:05:30]  Alright, here's Blaine  Tonight  Attention all Cougars  Get your bootay down to the feed tonight  Boogie Fever  With Allison live  Starting at 9 on 96.3  So I got my boots on  Got the right amount of lip  Allison's doing a cougar gig  Yeah, he's getting all the cougars down  To get their bootays on the floor  Bootays  Bootays  He's one of those guys  Every city has one of those guys  How come you guys don't do any gigs like that  When we can get all the cougars down to the club 
[02:06:00]  We should have a cougar night  Should we?  Burn it  Get the  Really?  At the Happyland Social Club  You don't like cougars?  Oh, do I hate a cougar  Stop it, cougar  Are you a fan of the cougar, Jimmy?  Some of them I'd fuck, sure  But I mean, it's not a thing for me  Like, if someone's really hot and they're older  Like, I'd fucking  I'd stick my  I'd stick my meat whistle in  And make potato flakes all over  A little  Starfish  My meat whistle 
[02:06:30]  Is that what he says?  I guess  Yeah  Shuby did Weez's show recently  Did he?  I love Shuby  I was listening  A cougar  I was listening to the Shuby  It's amazing what Shuby can get away with  Because of the way he phrases things  He can say anything  Alright, so there's Blaine  That's Blaine  And Allison's doing a cougar night  Right  And she's gonna get her big fat bootay down there  I don't think he said big or fat  Oh, I thought he said  She's gonna have her huge fat bootay  I don't think he did  Oh, okay 
[02:07:00]  Maybe I misheard  I just heard the clip once though  So  Yeah  We continue with  Jocktober  Blaine and Allison  Allison does an entertainment story  On who's the boss  Yeah  On a who's the boss actor  And then Sam writes  I hope you like impressions  Oh  Because you do a Tony Danza, right?  I try  Is that Allison right there?  Is that a picture of Allison?  I don't think it is  That's a woman  With a black man having sex with her  That's a cougar  Oh, oh  But that's a cougar  And she's doing the cougar gig 
[02:07:30]  And she has blonde hair  Just like the lady in this picture here  Right  I don't think that's actually Allison  It's a different lady?  Yeah  I think it's a different lady  That's not a black man  That's a Rottweiler  That's crazy  But like  I know like  You do a Tony Danza, right?  Well, yeah  Yeah, I've been known to  Sure  But what's good  What I like about you  Is that when somebody's got  A better impression than you  You are one to say  I'll fess right up to her  You know what?  Yeah  Oh, yeah, yeah  Are you going to step aside here?  I might have to  All right, let's  Let's see what this is all about  Do you have any TV theme music for me? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, I do  You know I do  Hit me one time  Yeah, you know I do  That's Blaine  He's got a wife and two kids  Got any TV theme music for me?  Yeah, I do  Yes, I do  What do you want to hear?  He's got a wife and two kids  Of course  Yeah, I do  Jesus  Do you have any TV theme music for me?  Yeah, I do  You know I do  Hit me one time  Angela  Hey, Angela 
[02:08:30]  Mona  Hey, Mona  How you doing?  You want to hit her?  You have to hit her with a cow prod  When the ball is falling  When you're teaching her a trick  Hit me one time  You got it, bitch  Yeah  With a chair  Love her to say that to me  When I'm in a semi  Hit me one time  What are they doing?  Uh, Dirty Danza  That's Dirty Danza  I saw it's like  Hey, hey  See what's great  Is that she says something 
[02:09:00]  And then like any good radio duo  He does the same impression  And says the exact same thing  Oh, really?  Yeah, if you listen  He goes  Hey, Mona  And then he goes  Hey, Mona  I gotta hear that again  Let's start over here  Do you have any TV theme music for me?  Yeah, I do  You know I do  Hit me one time  Angela  Hey, Angela  Mona  Hey, Mona  How you doing?  I'm Tony Danza 
[02:09:30]  Pull up with the van  Okay  Remember who's the boss?  I love that show  Who didn't?  Tony Danza's cool  What was Alyssa Milano's name?  I don't know  Angela  Mona  Samantha  Samantha  So what is your problem?  Well, don't forget about Danny  Hey, Danny  What was his name on the show?  Probably Danny  I don't know  Danny  I haven't seen it in a long time  Today here is your  Who's the boss fun fact  Oh, good 
[02:10:00]  Danny is currently selling Tupperware  Sweet  He has his own page  On the official Tupperware site  Where he offers himself  To Tupperware parties  In the Southern California area  He says  Quote  Welcome to my Tupperware page  My name is Daniel  And I'm a brand new Tupperware consultant  And now I will be too  I'll be looking that up later  Why don't we have him  Why don't we like  Put all of our money together  And have him come out here  And do a Tupperware show  For us on the show  Come on  Let's do it  Holy fuck 
[02:10:30]  We're in the same business  I'm one more concentrated  On what the fuck happened to him  With the Tupperware  What a zilch  He  Is  Uber gay  She really sounds like  She's always congested  Danny Pintor  You could tell he was gay  On the show  When he was just a little boy  He was like  Eight  Why don't we  See if we get some money together  And get him to a Tupperware party  Here  Oh yeah  And no one has anything bad  To say about anything  On that show 
[02:11:00]  Like  Who's the boss  He goes  Oh  I love that show  And she goes  Who didn't  I didn't  I like this random quote  That gets people listening  Where you just go  Oh yeah  Who did it  And you  And it's like  Oh he's getting  Doing a Tupperware thing  And you know  I think I'm going to be  Doing that too  In the spot where  You would insert a joke  Blaine goes  Tony Danza is cool  Yeah  Oh that was a place  For a joke  That's terrible  It would have been a great place  For a little joke  And what's up with Allison 
[02:11:30]  Does she have a cold  Or  She sounds stuffy right  Or is she just fat  Maybe just  I don't know  Is it a cold or fat  She didn't mention  Having a cold  So maybe it is  Just the fat  Some blah bar  Blah bar  Some blah bar  In the vocal area  Vocal cord area  It could be that  But I can't confirm  What did they just do there  Well they gave a funny news story  And then actually made it  Less funny with their commentary  Right  But can't you beat the shit  Out of the guy  For selling Tupperware at least  No it's their saying  You're not allowed to  On a show like that  It could be fun 
[02:12:00]  Could have a nice fun  Tupperware party  Plus  He was on a great show  They made it legit  Like let's get him  Yeah yeah  To Detroit  So we can have a Tupperware party  With this guy  It's a weird news story  Let's see if we can just  Make it a regular news story  They wanted to get him  For a Tupperware party  For a Tupperware party  On the air  And it wouldn't be like  Here's what we'll do to him  Here's a prank  We'll play on him  Here's something  We'll make fun of him for  It was just  He'll be here for a Tupperware party  No way 
[02:12:30]  How much fun would that be  Is that him?  They're saying that's him  That's his face  That's what Google says  Oh my god  That's the asshole  Is just wearing a jock strap  And grabbing his ball back  Well he's got a tattoo  On his right shoulder  So he could check  The other guy  Yeah  But wasn't the show good?  What show?  Who's the boss?  Who didn't like that show?  Yeah that's him  That's him huh?  Wow he's got some  Some kind of  Gee photos on  Uh yeah 
[02:13:00]  Some gee  Oh wow  Cock ring  Yeah  That's him  And he sells Tupperware  He's got abs  Yeah  You could put your medication  In this one  You could put your cocktail  Medicine in this one  You could eat soup  Right out of this one  It goes right to the microwave  Hey Mona  Hey  Angela  Mona  Hey  Hey Angela  Hey  Samantha  Oh Danny  Hey 
[02:13:30]  I don't know what his name  Of his character was  Tony Danza's cool  That's what he said  Tony Danza's cool  Can we hear that again  Because I really missed that  That means we have to play  The whole fucking thing  Oh that's worth it  It's really good stuff  Do you have any TV theme music  For me?  Yeah I do  You know what I do  Hit me one time  Hit me a little time  Near the cold  Or the fatness  Angela  Hey Angela  Mona  Hey Mona  How you doing  I'm Tony Danza  Oh he went out on his own there  Right  How you doing  But then he got nervous 
[02:14:00]  And said oh I better announce  Yeah  What voice I'm doing  Because no impression  Is better than the impression  When you say who you're doing  Right  I'm John Travolta  Naturally like speaking  Like for instance  I mid-sentence will often say  I'm Sam Roberts  Right  Right  Yeah yeah  That's what people do  Right  It's totally natural  I'm Jim Norton  It feels good  Yeah  And it really means the impression  So good  Dead on  That people just want to hear you  Say the person's name  Right  Sure  Not that they'd have no idea 
[02:14:30]  Who it was  Unless you said the name  And a lot of people are writing  Lose the hole  Remember we started that campaign  Yeah  We try to help radio guys out there  They just didn't want to listen to us  The lose the hole campaign  But in this case  You have to get rid of all three of them  Yeah  Just play some music  Just play the fucking music  Yeah  What is it?  Today's hits without the rap  Yeah I think that's nice  Racially motivated  Hey Mona  How you doing?  I'm Tony Danza  Pulling up in the van  Who's the boss?  Remember who's the boss? 
[02:15:00]  They're cracking each other up  And he probably  Remember who's the boss?  I think her impression  Was slightly off  Because I doubt that  Tony Danza  Ever actually said  Who's the boss?  Who's the boss?  But I bet when people  Walk in and see her  They go  Who's the pig?  We're just having a warm memory  Of growing up  Why don't you guys  Let anybody just have a good time?  These guys are just having a good time  Do you guys remember  Who's the boss?  Who doesn't remember it?  Of course  Of course  But it's  But who cares also? 
[02:15:30]  What difference does it make?  Exactly if I remember  Mind your business  What I remember  Fatso  Do you remember your feet?  What they look like?  Have you seen them in a long time?  That would be a great show  Who remembers my feet?  You think the German Shepherd  Is the boss  Oh without a doubt  Yeah  Who's the boss?  Who's the cuck?  I remember that  I was played  It was just cruel  To Alice in the whole show  And now it's the whole show  Who's wearing oven mitts?  Yeah  Exactly  Who's the boss?  Not your willpower  Fatso  Your willpower 
[02:16:00]  Is in the passenger seat  Who's the boss?  Self-escape  And addiction  Tubby  She's just trying  To do a show  Remember who's the boss?  I used to watch it  While shoving bonbons  Into my cunt  Of course you did  Fucking Louis Anderson  With tits  She wants to do  An entertainment story  Really?  Yeah  That's all  She just wants to play  Some soft rock  Or something  Oh I just want to hear her  Go 
[02:16:30]  Remember who's the boss?  I guarantee you  She would fucking  Put bonbons on a spoon  And bend them  And slingshot them  Into her mouth  Fire them  Like a trebuchet  Into her mouth  I want to try to find  Who's the boss?  Right?  Literally it was the last thing  That she said  Hey Mona  How you doing?  I'm Tony Danza  Pulling up in the van  Who's the boss?  Remember who's the boss?  I love that show  I didn't  Oh no  They said that to her 
[02:17:00]  They said  Who's the boss?  Who's the fucking boss?  What a blimp  Just rewind in like  Two seconds  Because the Tony Danza line  Is about to come  No  That's the whole reason  We're playing it again  Right  Oh  Too late  Oh  We've got to move on  Because now  I've got to hear  Tony Danza's cool  That's what I'm saying  Do you have any TV  Theme music for me?  Yeah I do  You know I do  Hit me one time  Angela  Hey Angela 
[02:17:30]  Mona  Hey Mona  How you doing?  I'm Tony Danza  Pulling up in the van  Who's the boss?  Remember who's the boss?  I love that show  Who didn't?  Tony Danza's cool  What was the list  Of Milano's name?  Why would you say  Tony Danza's cool?  He's not  Stop  It's like the bit  We did at the  Tony Danza show  Yeah  Remember you were just  Exactly  We were just  Talking about cool  Hey Mona  Hey Samantha  Who's the boss? 
[02:18:00]  I'm pulling up in the van  He's cool  Shut up  Mona is anybody  Whose feet she steps on  You're a real Mona  Because your feet bones  Are broken  Get it  The only van I want to see  Pulling up is  Buffalo Bill  For that fat cunt  Allison  Oh Allison  Diamonds cutting her back  Yeah  Allison  Bimmel  Did the rancher  Make you watch  Who's the boss  That he sodomized you  No  He's a very decent

It sure is  Things kids don't know  Count to ten 
[02:34:00]  That's not the direction Blaine and Allison went  Oh they take a different direction than Uncle Paul  Far different direction  They don't end up doing pedophile humor  No they don't end up doing that  Why?  Playing it safe over there in Detroit  It's just not something  You wake up in the morning  And you're looking for something  That helps you get up and start the day  That Uncle Paul stuff  You gotta admit  Is a little much for a morning show  Yeah  Well let's see what the  Things kids don't know about  Bit is all about  Here's another thing kids today  Don't really 
[02:34:30]  Aren't really down with  Yeah  Addressing envelopes  You gotta show them how to lick  Here's how you make the envelopes  Stick  You run your tongue  Across the crease  And then what?  Then you push it down  And it gets sticky  It's a good lesson for children  Oh Uncle Paul  It's terrible 
[02:35:00]  That darn envelope  Don't do no working  Give it a lick  There's a lot of spit too right?  Yeah you gotta get the envelope  All good  And sticky  They'll lick across the crease  Oh goodness  Oh my  Here's another thing kids today  Don't really  Aren't really down with  Addressing envelopes 
[02:35:30]  Oh wait  I totally have a perfect example  Of that one  Oh no  Who's that?  Strap in  Here it comes  I don't think that's Allison  That may be Dana  Who's Dana again?  Dana  She's the traffic girl  But she pipes in with her two cents  Every now and then  Thank God for that Sam  No shutting that brought up  She's a good example  Yeah  Can't hold back words of wisdom  Of how kids don't know  How to address an envelope  Yeah  Oh wait  I totally have a perfect example  Of that one  Yeah I get that  Dan teaches a class 
[02:36:00]  At our temple  Uh huh  A couple days a week  Yeah  And he had to  Boo  Boo  Boo  Boo to the two  Boo  She's just trying to fit in  With the show  Dan teaches a class  At our temple  And  And  Yeah  And we'll find out  A class at our temple  Uh huh  A couple days a week  Yeah  And he had to explain to the kids  Whatever project they were doing  They were like  What's this?  And he goes  That's an envelope  This is a stamp  Oh that's so funny 
[02:36:30]  This is a return address  See  What?  I told you  What's so funny?  I told you it was so funny  It's a perfect example  Oh no  Go back  Let's watch  Just tell me when to fucking stop  She goes  Oh what's this?  Just point  I don't know what you're getting  Hold on  A couple days a week  Yeah  And he had to explain to the kids  Whatever project they were doing  They were like  What's this?  And he said  A messiah  A jew  Go back a little  Fucking loved October 
[02:37:00]  It is a great month  To explain to the kids  Whatever project they were doing  They were like  What's this?  A tip  That's not cool  A jew humor  Rick Sanchez  Is laughing somewhere  Oh yes he is  He sure is  Sam  He sure is  Oh my god  Oh a temple  But they gave the perfect example 
[02:37:30]  And then  The kids were like  What's this?  An envelope  Oh let me be holding that  And then someone said  It's hilarious  What's funny about it?  They said  As was cited  On your playlist  That is so funny  I need a yogurt  Please  Let me shake my yogurt  Nice  What kind you got today?  Blueberry Dannon  What?  Oh Dannon you go with?  You don't go with that fig yogurt?  No this is good  The fig?  Activia  Activia yogurt sucks  Charlie Watts hair?  No  To explain to the kids 
[02:38:00]  Whatever project they were doing  They were like  What's this?  And he goes  That's an envelope  This is a stamp  Oh that's so funny  This is a return address sticker  How's that funny?  Break it down  Why is that funny?  No one laughs  That's funny  Well  It's not  Oh gosh  It may be interesting  For a couple people  But it's not funny  Why would that be funny?  It's funny  To adults  The premise of  Do you know what an envelope is?  You would say  Of course I do  I've used them throughout my life  Whereas a child 
[02:38:30]  Because of the electronic age  And email  Yes  They wouldn't have used  Envelopes  Just emails  So it's not as obvious  To them  That's why it's so funny  No but the thing is this  It's like Sam is saying  The  You got it a little on me  Oh god  That's so funny  This is a return address sticker  I will say though  In fairness to the kids  On that one  Do you remember being in school  And learning how to  Address an envelope?  Yes  She really sounds fat 
[02:39:00]  In this clip  You think so?  Oh yeah  That one  Do you remember being in school  And learning how to  Address an envelope?  Yep  So we were actually  We were taught that  I'm sure they don't teach it now  Because how necessary  Well no  You still got mail stuff  You get your bills in the mail  Some people still do  Shut up  They went on for like  Another five minutes  About envelopes  Oh I don't doubt it  Bet you also remember  Crying during Charlotte's Web  Don't you fatso? 
[02:39:30]  Wilbur  And there's a pig  You're gonna Wilbur  That's not cool  They just discussed envelopes  Yeah I mean  They kept going about the envelopes  I decided to cut our losses  And get to the next thing  No one's mean  Yeah because the next one  Sam writes  More hilarious things  Kids can't do  Yeah  I have to be some  Charming motherfucking pig  Like that Allison  From the Blaine and I  More things the kids 
[02:40:00]  Don't know how to do  How about this?  Operating a can opener  Because they're used to  Pull tabs on everything  Speaking of a can opener  Big fat cock  Shoves up his buddy's ass  Uncle Paul you got anything  On the can opener?  No  I don't like can openers  I like warm papaya juice  And sardine oil  Sardine oil? 
[02:40:30]  You just open the can a little  And you drain the oil  Out of the sardines  Earl  You teach the kids  How to lick it  Oh sweet  Give me that  Give me that  This one's the best though  Extracting ice cubes  From a tray  They don't know how to do that  They're so  A kid knows how to do that  He just never had to do that  Extracting ice cubes  From a tray  Sometimes you have to  What are you talking about?  Sometimes you have to exaggerate  For the humor value  Do you?  Oh really?  You tell me when that humor value 
[02:41:00]  Pokes it  Rears its ugly head  They act like there's some crazy stuff  What fucking kid doesn't understand  What does a kid do?  Look at an ice tray  And not know what to do with it?  Ah  Just dumps the whole tray in a drink  Yeah  He just pours the juice over the tray  And then tips it into his mouth  Fucking autistic  Get a hold of yourselves  They don't know how to do that  They're so used to  Freezers with the little button on the front  That just kicks out the ice cubes  They don't know how you do the  Now they're explaining how you get ice  In this day and age  Thank God  Because I don't know  Yeah  A lot of freezers 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  Ice cubes  They don't know how you do the twist  Yeah  They don't know that  They don't know how to  You know  Wait a second  People don't have ice trays  In their freezers anymore  Am I living in a little house  On the prairie over at my house?  Yeah you are  Is that Allison with the dogs?  Yeah  She's a little house on the barn  A little barn on the prairie  She's eating hay and oats alone  Oh  She's shitting in her sleep space  She's making her sound like a farm animal  Did you say shitting in her sleep space? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  That's what wild animals do  They shit and then they just doze off right next to it  You said sleep space  Cover it with some hay  Like a horse nose  It's just a nice lady trying to do a radio show  And you guys are referring to her as a farm animal  Who sleeps in her own shit  She's fucking fat  She stinks  She is overweight  She really is  You mean to tell me  No one knows how to use an ice cube tray anymore?  Shut up  Exactly  Little house on the prairie over at my house?

[02:43:30]  Well track five relates to this bit  So maybe you do track five and then take the leak  That sounds good  We can do that  This is a big sort of  A call from a listener Blaine has to take  Like he has to  He sees the call on the call screen  And he's like  And that's it  That will complement what we're doing perfectly  Oh wow  Followed by a story that would have been more effective  If it hadn't been said  Oh no  This is  I gotta take this call  Mary  What is it that kids can't do? 
[02:44:00]  They can't talk to one another  They text each other  They won't talk  It's funny  There was kind of a  A little bit about that  The other night on the Modern Family episode  Yeah  This girl  Of course he likes watching Modern Family  Holy shit  Who do you think his favorite characters are?

[02:44:30]  Yeah  This girl's kind of  One of the girls in the family  Has kind of a crush on this boy  And  And  They were talking about their first kiss  You know  Maybe we'll have our first kiss  And she's like  I think we should probably get to know each other  After all  This is our only second  Non-texting conversation  Oh  That's funny  I can see that  Enough with that's funny  Oh  That's funny  That's the story  It's not funny  Oh  I can see that  What's that  The Grim Reaper  You mean because she's morbidly obese 
[02:45:00]  Yeah  Oh man  I know it ain't Richard Simmons  I can see that  You know it's not the gym  It's a fucking ice cream cake  The plaque in her arteries  Oh I can see that  It's a cake through the wall  Like Superman  She's so hungry  She's got x-ray vision for food  Yeah only for sugary delicious treats  Of course she does  She'll look right past an exercise bike  And spot a fucking cookie  We got it Jim  She can smell that shit  Now can we take our break

[02:46:30]  Blaine and Allison on WDVD in Detroit  Today's best hits without the rap  That's right  A fine choice today from young Sam  Racist  Without the  I do know what they mean by without the rap  That's what I'm saying  I think it's a lot  You saw the DJs on that webpage  Yeah  They had one thing in common  I think it's irracially motivated  I bet it means saran rap  Because there's never any seconds at her house 
[02:47:00]  Nothing makes it to the fridge  What would be their top five artists  That they play on this radio station  Just so we could get a better feel  For what they do Sam  Yeah they would play Pink  They'd play Adam Lambert  Meatloaf  Lady Gaga  Maybe a Lady Gaga  But that might be a little too poppy  Maybe like a James Blunt type  That type of you know 
[02:47:30]  It's definitely more adult oriented  Contemporary music  Okay  Alright  People saying Modern Family is not funny  Well they're wrong  It is funny  And I should stick with  Arrested Development on DVD  Good choice  And Always Sunny in Philadelphia  You can watch more than one show  Why are you getting mad?  Because we don't want to watch  Modern Family with you  No because they are  Why is that show good?  Because it's funny  It's just a funny  What are you doing in your plan Steve?  You alright Stevie?  The fuck are you doing 
[02:48:00]  Standing next to me?  It's usually Anthony wanted me to see him  What's going on today?  Out of your fucking mind?

Yeah he don't know  In this show I have a fucking space  It's so funny  As they were talking  I just saw Ant look at him  Like what the fuck  I'm like what is it?  I thought he was bringing Jimmy something  And I realized he's just standing there  Like a fucking retard  Like impending doom  Impending doom  I should fucking grab his shirt 
[02:49:00]  And smash a bottle over his head  I feel like half a fag over here  Alright Stevie leave  Sorry Stevie  Get out of here  That's hilarious though  Misunderstanding  So Blaine and Allison  WDVD in Detroit  Yeah  They play the number one game right here  We're going to learn about the number one game  The game is called  What's number one  What's number one  What's number one  I hope I know the rules here  Is this easy? 
[02:49:30]  If I had you  Blaine and Allison in the morning  On today's  Best hits  Without the rap  96.3 WDVD  Adam Lambert  If I had you  Favorite song right now  Love it  Of course it is  Oh my god  What's that about?  Adam Lambert  Favorite song right now  Love it  Him and his wife and kids  Love it  Me, my wife  Cause I'm married  Right  And my kids  Cause I was able to have sexual intercourse  With my wife  Fertilize eggs

Scott Vertical  You think he likes Adam Lambert?  Everybody should be following  Scott Vertical on Twitter right now  I need Ray back  I think he'd have a lot to say  That Blaine  He's obsessed  That Blaine likes Adam Lambert  Everyone has to  Do you have to play Adam Lambert  On hits one there Sam?  I don't have to  But I certainly do 
[02:50:30]  You have a playlist  Huh?  You can't  Of course you have to  You have a playlist  What is Bernie Williams doing?

It does go through the ears  In the auditory system  Is how you hear it 
[02:52:00]  Alright let's get back to  Number one  If I had you  Lane and Allison  Reporting  On today's best hits  Without the rap  96.3 WDVD  Adam Lambert  If I Had You  Favorite song right now  Love it  He's singing to AIDS  Love it  We gave the monitors  A serious workout  In the studio  Just a second ago  Well with that  And Loverboy  But there was that  Yeah  We did  We did throw some  Loverboy down  A little bit ago  Because Allison was like 
[02:52:30]  I don't like this  Why don't you shut it  Why don't you  It's time to play  What's number one  He made the fridge  Oh hey  Why don't you shut it  The refrigerated door  A serious workout  And one and two and three  But it doesn't even go  When she opens it  It's so fucking  It doesn't even seal properly  Seals are broken  It closes like an old screen door  She's using it so much 
[02:53:00]  You're saying the seal is worn off  Yeah  She's always opening it  A little bit  She's fat  What were they  Getting on each other  A little bit there  Yeah  A little  Like oh  Why don't you  Cut it out  Hey look  They're about to play  This amazing game  It's called  What's number one  And this is kind of  What separates  Blaine and Allison  From other radio shows  What's number one  Is a game  Where they have a list  And you  The callers guess  What's  Number one 
[02:53:30]  On the list  Oh  So you have a list  Yeah  And the callers  Have to guess  What's the number one  Thing on that list  Yeah  Oh okay  So that's kind of  What separates them  Right  From  From  From a good show  Oh  We could play  What's number one  On this show  If we had some lists  Sure we got one  Allison's Snacks  What's trickling  Into Jimmy's mouth  These are not  The type of  Morning friendly lists  No  What's wrong with you  This list is 
[02:54:00]  Worst movie  Oh my  He's already  About that thing  Because he can't  Even take it  This is how funny  This is  He's been waiting  All morning  Watch it  Yeah  Oh watch out  This list is  Worst movie accents  Of all time  Oh I forgot to tell you  What number one is  Before on the air  Okay that's alright  Because I don't  I don't even know  Why would you tell  Everyone what number one is  No he forgot to tell  Allison what number one is  Why  Because the last thing  He wants is Allison  Accidentally guessing number one 
[02:54:30]  And then the listeners  Don't get to guess number one  And that's no fun  Yeah but when we do  This horse shit  And then guess is number one  When we're gonna do the bit  For twenty minutes  It's kind of  It's kind of good  Horse shit  Right  Because this is penciled in  For this break  So  Oh they gotta like  Waste some time  If she guessed number one  They would have literally  Nothing to talk about  For five minutes  She can't make something up  At that point  No  Why not  The radio  Because they already  Did the envelopes  Is that a cool picture  Danny  All she knows about movies 
[02:55:00]  Is the accents that were used  When she starred in  Operation Dumbo Truck  Who did she play  The elephant  If you haven't seen the picture  Of Tiger Woods  From the Ryder Cup  I think it was yesterday  He shanked his fucking wedge  I think  And it went right  Toward the photographer  And the photographer  Got the ball  Like coming at him  Before it hit him  It hit him  Wow  It did hit him  Oh yeah man  That is like  They'd fuck his camera up  It's going right  Toward his lens  Right toward his lens  People are that close to him  When he's golfing  Yeah they all just trust 
[02:55:30]  That he's going to  Not shank or anything  No no no  But I mean  They're all  They're allowed that close  Oh just because  He was probably  He was off the course  At that point  Yeah  Alright let's go back  To number one  Hey that's alright  Because I don't  I don't even know  You don't  Nothing's  Come on  Brad Pitt in something  I know  Shockingly  Brad Pitt  Is not on the list  I remember him getting  Skewered  For some accent  He did in some movie  Yeah this one  In Glory's Passage  I thought it was Snatch
