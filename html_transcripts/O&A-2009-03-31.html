<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a truly awful, floppy beanie hat, reminiscent of a 1950s movie prop.  This segued into a discussion of upcoming show giveaways, including a cup of dirt signed by Brian Regan and a disgustingly sweat-stained hat worn by Eric for years.  The hosts also briefly touched upon their upcoming move to a new studio, expressing some apprehension and recounting an audience member's injury from celebratory streamers, as well as lamenting numerous lost or stolen items during the transition.  They concluded this initial segment by announcing the addition of a daily Twitter story segment to the show.

The show then shifted focus to a furious rant about various taxes, particularly a new "public safety" tax levied on New York cell phone bills. Opie and Anthony dissected the confusing and seemingly arbitrary fees plaguing cell phone bills, criticizing the lack of transparency regarding how the money is spent.  They fielded calls from listeners nationwide sharing similar frustrations over excessive and unexplained taxes, including gas taxes, mileage taxes, and various government fees.  This spurred a broader discussion about government mismanagement, citing examples such as a $56,000 handrail, lack of accountability for welfare recipients, and the lavish spending habits of some politicians, specifically mentioning Charlie Rangel's Cadillac lease and the GM bailout and Rick Wagoner's large payout.  A caller, a construction worker, highlighted the perceived hypocrisy of drug testing for government jobs but not for welfare recipients. The conversation further explored the economic downturn and criticized overspending by both Republican and Democrat administrations.

The latter portion of the show featured a discussion about Jim Norton's recent appearance on Sean Hannity's show. Norton recounted Hannity's nervousness and the overall awkwardness of the situation.  He also shared a humorous anecdote about an encounter with Dennis Prager, who was working on a book tentatively titled "Your Husband Is Not a Pervert." The show then transitioned to a discussion of Harold Perrineau (Michael from *Lost*), his experience on the show, and his portrayal of his character.  The broadcast concluded with announcements of upcoming guests, including Bill Burr, and giveaways, such as signed *Lost* DVDs and that aforementioned cup of dirt signed by Brian Regan.

[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much.

[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Who would I sacrifice in a chimp attack so the family gets 50 mil? 
[00:04:00]  50 mil for a chimp attack.  50 million?  I'd put on a chimp outfit and bite my mother's face off.  I was lucky enough to be in Istanbul.  It's 90-something percent Muslim, but it was the good kind.  I mean, every once in a while you would see one and they would point out that's a radical Muslim.  They were pretty regular.  Holding a head in his hand.  This is what's left of a Pennsylvania dog kennel after a propane tank ignited, setting the pens on fire. 
[00:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Really classic.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sitting over there reading my papers and Anthony's bitching and complaining about taxes as per usual. 
[00:05:00]  And I don't blame you.  I'm not saying that that's wrong.  I just want to know more.  This is a cell phone tax.  I want to know more, too.  Yeah, well, New York State apparently.  Wow.  Does anyone have a cell phone bill handy?  I can log in.  Maybe we can do a little, like, I know it's like a let's make a deal thing, but take a look.  First of all, take a look at your cell phone bill and try to figure out half those charges.  Yep.  See what is actually the charge of using the equipment and making the calls. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And you'll be stunned at how little of the bill that is.  Right.  The rest of it is all these taxes and other surcharges, which is tax.  So there's a new one going on.  We have another $1.20 a month being stuck on every New Yorker's cell phone bill.  Starting when?  You know, it's always vague.  They just say, yeah, it's going to happen.  Then someday, you know, you turn around and there it is. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  How do we vote against this stuff?  You don't.  You voted in the guy that okayed it.  He's representing you.  Is he really?  Did anyone say, I want this?  Right.  That's where the whole representation thing goes right down the shitter.  It's like, I didn't want this.  I'm okay with people that argue Democrat, argue Republican.  I like to argue just politician.  I know the Democrats are known for taxing more.  Democrats are notorious for taxing. 
[00:06:30]  Taxing spending, yeah.  But I'm not a fan of just about every politician out there.  I'm trying to think if there's one politician where I'm like, rah, rah, rah.  Do you have one rah, rah politician that you get behind?  For real.  He's been put in the ground.  Yeah, Reagan was good.  But we were too young to really understand what he was about.  Yeah, I know.  All we knew was he was the great communicator.  Yes, he was.  He came up with catchy little things when people, like, disintegrated.  Yeah, they just need, you know, when they need a little boost, a little lift.  He knew how to. 
[00:07:00]  Reagan was there.  He knew how to throw some poetry at us.  Ronnie Reagan.  And turn those sad tears into happy tears.  But this tax is like, and this is just one of many taxes that we're getting hit with here  in New York State and then in other states, in your state, where you're listening right  now.  I'm sure your governor and all the people in charge in your state are coming up with the  same types of things.  This is called a public safety tax that is going on your cell phone. 
[00:07:30]  The gall.  What does that even mean?  Do we know what that means?  What is the public safety?  What am I getting in return?  Because usually when you're taxed, you're supposed to get something in return for that  money, or at least somebody is supposed to get something in return for it.  They're supposed to pretend you're getting something in return, at least.  Yeah, at least fake it.  What is a public safety tax that is worth, you know, a lot of goddamn cell phones, and 
[00:08:00]  a buck twenty or something like that, a clip from New York State, going to pull in, you  know, maybe ten, fifteen thousand dollars.  Probably.  Perhaps.  Well, they say it actually is going to go hand in hand with the usage charge.  Usage.  I'm going to use it.  Of course there's a usage charge.  Yeah, why do they have to charge you a usage charge?  Usage.  If you get a cell phone, it's pretty safe to say you're going to use it. 
[00:08:30]  We have to give you an excise tax.  What the hell?  What?  These politicians suck.  The tax...  And we are being slammed now.  They are using the economy, the bad economy, to just tax the shit out of everybody.  And quite frankly, it's the democratic way to do it.  They love doing it this way.  Instead of really thinking it out, seeing if there's other options, cutting, cutting the 
[00:09:00]  crap that goes on in every state in this country.  The money that is being wasted by these politicians and the corporate contracts that are going...  It's just a big game that's been played for years and years and years.  And they take a little tax here, a little tax here.  Yeah.  And it just adds up to a point where people can't afford nothing.  When are they going to start working on looking into mismanagement? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That should be a key...  Who's she?  That should be a key phrase for any politician out there that's brave enough to really take  on the tough targets.  Mismanagement.  Say, that's my platform.  Yeah.  Mismanagement.  I want to know why the transit system, the MTA here in New York City, is broke.  Because every time I get on a subway, we're squeezed in like sardines.  Every time I'm on a roadway paying tolls, they're backed up forever. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  You just see ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching as people are flying through easy passes.  It's amazing.  How the F is that mis...  How the F are they broke?  How are they broke?  Somebody isn't handling the money properly.  This is what I wanted.  All the charges on a cell phone bill.  You got the usage charge.  Usage.  Under the taxes, governmental surcharges, and fees, you got the New York State E-911 fee.  What?  You got the New York City 9-1-1 surcharge. 
[00:10:30]  You got the New York State sales tax.  You got the New York City sales tax.  And you got the New York local MCTD sales tax.  What is that?  That's under the taxes, governmental surcharges, and fees section of a phone bill.  And now tack another buck 20 on there for public safety tax.  Well, then you go to the Verizon wireless surcharges, which include the Fed universal service charge, the regulatory charge, the administrative charge, and the gross receipts surcharge.  What is it?  By the way, do what I do.  I've actually asked one of the dummies that works for these fucking phone companies. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God.  What is this?  I want...  Those are government charges.  No, no, no.  Break down each one and tell me what they do.  If I'm paying this, I have the right to...  And they will not be able to tell you.  They won't be able to tell you.  Where is that going?  Where is that money being deposited?  When I pay my phone bill, that money has to come out and go into some treasury.  Where is it going and where is it being put after it's in there? 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't even understand.  Universal what?  Yeah, shouldn't we know what we're paying for?  They put it in a language that you just can't understand by reading the name of the tax.  What it even is.  A FED or a Fed.  Probably Fed Universal Service Charge.  And someone, by the way, is saying this new tax allows you to call 911 for free off your cell phone.  But then they have the 911 tax. 
[00:12:00]  Well, that's why I'm a little confused now.  Aren't there two 911 taxes?  A 911 something or 911 search?  Well, you got the New York City E-9-1-1 fee, and then you got the New York City 911 surcharge.  How much is each one?  A few cents, right?  That's $1.50 a month that you're paying for that.  How many times do you call 911 in your lifetime?  Well, 20 or 30.  Hopefully maybe once or twice.  Once.  Hopefully.  But it's, I don't know.  The way they, it's unbelievable. 
[00:12:30]  The way they tax you is just crazy.  Oh, look at James.  How cute.  Your state is a little behind there, James.  James in New Hampshire.  Go ahead.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  I just wanted to give you a Massachusetts putting in some new taxes for you.  They're jacking up the gas tax, 17 cents.  Yes.  And they also want to install a microchip in your inspection sticker so that they can calculate how many miles  you travel every year and re-tax you on that gas by charging you mileage for the year. 
[00:13:00]  No.  That's crazy.  Come on.  Not only will it not eliminate tolls, but there's talk of more tolls.  They just cannot stop sticking their dick down your throat.  They cannot get their hands out of everybody's pocket.  And now there's a virtual feeding frenzy amongst the politicians.  A feeding frenzy of taxes where they see one guy get away with it.  They see one state or Obama gets away with it with saying, well, we're going to tax the $250,000 and over thing. 
[00:13:30]  But it's a lot more than just people making $250,000 and we knew it would be.  And now it's pretty much coming down to everybody because they see that and then everybody else goes, yeah, it's a way  to cure some of these ills.  Let me jack the taxes up for this and this and that.  All the way down to the local level where you got your state-run officials are taxing you for the state 
[00:14:00]  and then your local governments, your little townships.  You get these things in the mail and you realize they're taxing this.  They're charging you a little more on your water bill.  They're doing it nickel and diming you to the point where it adds up where it's like you're already paying half and half with the government.  It's amazing.  And now they just want more.  It's absolutely amazing.  More, more, more.  Let me say hi to Mike in Cleveland. 
[00:14:30]  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, Mike.  You guys in?  Yeah, Mike.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  This is really pissing me off.  I'm in construction in Cleveland and I got to take a piss test to work on government jobs, state and federal jobs.  Yeah.  Then they take my money, they don't give me any choice of it, and they give it to welfare recipients  who don't have to pass a piss test to get welfare.  This is bullshit.  You know what?  That's not a bad point, man.  I mean, if you want to accept government money, like to live, right? 
[00:15:00]  There are people that fall on hard times.  Oh, yeah.  Eh, how about we know that you're not doing drugs because that way you at least could be looking for gainful employment.  Right.  That's a great point.  You know what?  I got a piss to earn it.  Fuck yeah, man.  That's right.  It's amazing, too, that you look at the way they're handling these bailouts.  They were just saying yesterday, Obama wants the head of GM out.  He goes, hey, we gave you money.  I don't like the way you're running things, so get the fuck out. 
[00:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Point taken.  That could be argued either way.  Sure.  Whatever.  But if you look at welfare recipients, people that are on the government dole, they are being bailed out, if you will, because they can't afford things.  There's absolutely nobody looking after what they're doing as far as how they're spending the government's money.  And by government money, it's your money.  The government's supposed to be holding it and doing things that makes your life easier. 
[00:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's pretty much all it is.  The government money, we look at it as this vague, abstract thing.  It's your money.  That's what you pay every year in taxes, every day in taxes, pretty much.  So there's no accountability for that.  And the fact that they're calling out the car companies and the banks and everybody else that they've had to bail out for mismanagement, yet they will never call out each other on mismanagement. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, of course not.  All these pork barrel deals and earmarks and politicians' pals that are getting money from these guys, they never call them out for mismanagement.  Congress is the worst managed money you ever want to see.  Well, I think they'll call out, Republicans will call out Democrats, Democrats will call out Republicans.  But you'll never hear Democrats calling out, it's amazing to me.  It just looks like inter-party fighting, which has been going on for years. 
[00:17:00]  You'll never see Democrats call out Democrats.  Never.  On the fact that they're wasting money.  Charlie Rangel, one of our great fucking douchebags here in New York, a $777 lease on his Cadillac every year.  Because he had to have a fucking Cadillac.  On the public dole?  Park that thing, bitch!  Get a hybrid!  You don't like hybrids, though. 
[00:17:30]  Fuck him!  I'm earning my money and paying for it.  He's being paid by the taxpayer.  He's going to fuck himself and bicycle in like Ed Begley Jr.  So you want him to have a sensible ride?  Yes, sensible.  Not a Cadillac.  A politician who's using the people's money should be cutting corners at every turn to save money for the people.  Because that is mismanagement. 
[00:18:00]  That is getting a huge bonus if you're an AIG employee.  That's driving around or taking a corporate jet if your company's broke.  We're in pretty much a depression here.  And these motherfuckers are driving around in leased Cadillacs on the government, on our taxpayers' money?  Fuck off.  Listen to this one.  Rich in D.C.  Hello, Rich.  Hi, guys.  I'm a construction contractor for the federal government.  Yeah.  And we had a 700 and some page manual on replacing a handrail at one of the museums. 
[00:18:30]  It ended up being a $56,000 handrail for this government agency.  Unbelievable.  Absolutely absurd.  And it was someone's pal that got the contract.  And it just always happens that way.  The government spending is amazing.  Yeah.  And they sit around saying we're broke.  We don't know where we're going to get this money from.  It's like, why don't you look at your cells for once? 
[00:19:00]  They're notorious overspenders for everything.  You've done some construction in your life.  What do you think a handrail should cost to, seriously, to replace?  A handrail, depending on how big it is.  In a museum, something like that.  You can even go like-  Go high end.  Go pretty high end.  Yeah.  Where it would probably cost like, I don't know.  How much did he say it cost?  $56,000.  $56,000.  With a 700 plus page manual.  The fuck out of here.  If you're spending over $10,000 on an exotic wood friggin' handrail. 
[00:19:30]  We could find this money.  Yeah.  It's called mismanagement, but no one wants to look into that.  They just think it's a better thing to reach back into our pockets again.  And not only our pockets, and I hate to say this, but the pockets of the future generations.  Because we are so fucked as far as debt goes.  And I'll blame Bush for a part of this, too, with the war, the amount of money that was  spent on that.  But the Democrats come wheeling in and decide now it's time to spend even more money of 
[00:20:00]  the taxpayers' money, gather it up.  We're just, we're fucked.  Maybe someone can explain this to me, because I don't get it.  We were economically in better shape, I think, when Clinton was president.  And that could be, stuff was beyond the present.  And what the, was it just the war that was funded that caused so much fucking money?  I mean, I think all.  The war cost a fuckload of money.  And Clinton cut a lot of stuff.  He cut a lot of expensive stuff, military. 
[00:20:30]  Isn't it safe to say, though, all these politicians, way before Obama even, like, knew all this was  coming down the highway, but just kind of wanted to ignore it?  I don't know.  Because it seemed like Bush leaves office and the entire planet, you know, falls apart.  This is very panicky stuff that we're in right now.  Yeah.  This is a very panicky situation where people hear news bites, sound bites, and knee-jerk  react and pull money out of the market. 
[00:21:00]  They stay, oh, the housing's down.  Oh, my God, saw my house.  Right.  You know, people just freak out.  Right.  Bill in Portugal, you won't read this on air, probably, but GM did the right thing in kicking  Rick Wagoner.  Is that how you say his last name?  Yes.  To the curb, whether Ant believes it or not.  During his reign, the stock lost 95% of its value, and now the company is hemorrhaging  cash everywhere.  I never said that.  Did I even say that it wasn't?  I said whether you believe he should be gone or not. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I said there's accountability there.  I said Obama is putting accountability on the auto industry for the money that they  give him.  You can't just give him money without accountability.  Right.  But apparently, there are certain places and people we give money to, huge amounts of money  to, with zero accountability.  There you go.  That's what I was saying.  This motherfucker, I could give a shit if he lost his job.  Yeah.  GM is in fucked shape.  Yeah.  Let's go.  You can look at the reasons.  Let's go to Robin in Detroit. 
[00:22:00]  Robin.  Hi, guys.  I'm from the shitty of Detroit.  Yeah.  All right.  What'd you say?  Rick Wagoner stepped down, but that piece of shit got $23 million.  Yeah.  I don't feel sorry for these guys when you see him on the front page of these papers.  Yeah.  He's not going to be on the unemployment line.  I heard he's walking away with a nice sum of money.  You're saying $23 million.  He started in 2000.  Stock was $70 a share, and now it was $362 at the end of last week.  Yeah, yeah.  I could do that.  Yeah.  I could take stock and lose fucking $67 a share on whatever it is. 
[00:22:30]  The thing is, look at the Dow in general.  It's way the fuck down.  Yeah.  You're not looking at GM like the only company that's lost a giant percentage of their worth  in the market.  And it's not just, you know, so you're going to kick out every CEO.  Look at the banks.  Right.  I like Jimmy's point he's trying to make, though.  As the CEO, he could do exactly what Mr. Wagoner did.  Yeah, you could step in, sit there.  I see you in the big glass corner office somewhere in Detroit as like Ted the CEO, and all you're 
[00:23:00]  doing is playing old school asteroids as your company is falling apart.  Just making questionable decision after questionable decision.  What are you talking about?  The wheel design is wrong.  They should be squares.  Rubber squares.  That's ridiculous.  We'll lose money.  Conk, conk, conk, conk.  Just cars that go conk, conk.  I'd run the company like Kramer when he went to work at that corporate place. 
[00:23:30]  What's in the briefcase?  Crackers.  Oh, my God.  It's like you have no business being here.  I don't.  Take the windows off.  No one needs windows.  They're not cost effective.  You give them just a little slit to see out of.  Like a tank.  Right.  Yes.  A tank slit.  Yeah.  Or you take the front window and the side windows, and that's it.  Or there's no windows whatsoever.  And it's like, it's cut down on.  It'll save our pieces because we're not melting the sand into glass. 
[00:24:00]  Let the bugs fly through your hair.  Sunny day cars, I call them.  Hey, let's say hi to a cop in Westchester.  His name is Mike.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Big fan, guys.  Yeah, thanks, Mike.  I'm retired from the city.  The guys who work in the city, I worked for the NYPD for 22 years.  Yeah.  You used to have to pay a commuter tax.  Yeah.  And the union had a problem with it because we were paying tax in New York City. 
[00:24:30]  We should have been able to vote.  And, of course, we looked back in court.  That was a big deal also.  I'm amazed.  If you guys want to talk about the Board of Education, in New York City, their budget is $12 billion a year.  Right.  The average teacher makes $660 per day on a 180-day work schedule.  I worked on an investigation at Livingston Street, and that is just throwing money down the toilet. 
[00:25:00]  There is no productivity whatsoever rating for teachers.  Yeah, another, you know, they're not held accountable.  I don't want to smack around teachers, guys.  Stay strong.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, that commuter tax just always, I never understood the commuter tax considering people  were using their cars, paying the tolls.  Yeah.  Then parking their car in the city, which brings revenue into the city, no matter how you look  at it.  18% fucking tax when you park.  Yeah.  When you park, dude, there's taxes when you buy the car. 
[00:25:30]  Then there's taxes when you register it.  Right.  The registration, the inspection.  Right.  Like, at every turn, there's taxes.  You're being taxed.  And then, hey, you got to pay commuter tax, too.  Commuter tax.  What the fuck?  Why am I paying that?  Yeah.  Just to come into the city to make money.  And then when all is said and done, and they tax you, and you get whatever percentage of  the money that's left from you working, everything you buy is taxed. 
[00:26:00]  And every dollar you make without spending it is fucking taxed.  Yeah.  If you just sit home.  Yeah, just sit home.  And if you want to put it in the bank and make a measly 1% or 2% interest on it.  Just what?  That money you made with your money is taxed.  But you already taxed that money I put in the bank.  How can you tax it again?  What happened?  No, we're taxing the money you're making on it.  How can you tax the money again?  Because technically, that's what's going on.  It's infuriating.  Decide to do the right thing. 
[00:26:30]  Put a few bucks in the bank.  Yeah, a few shackles.  And then they tax that.  Great.  And if you make money in the market, they fucking tax it.  Oh, they tax it.  But if you lose a shitload of money in the market, you can only write off a very small  amount.  You can't write it all off every year, can you?  You can only write off against what you gained.  So if they tax, you made $100, and then they tax it, you've got to pay them $50.  And then you lost like $100. 
[00:27:00]  You could also use that to go against what you won.  You can only use your losings against your winnings.  You can't just say, hey, I lost a shitload in the market.  I want to put that against my income tax.  Right.  Because they have to get paid somehow.  Of course.  They have to say, you're paying us first, and then you can weigh your losses against that.  It's always that way.  If the government finds out that they made some type of mistake on your taxes, you get  the money back.  If you made a mistake, you pay them, plus interest and penalties and everything else. 
[00:27:30]  Where's my interest and penalties when they have to pay me?  Mm-hmm.  You know?  They don't give you money.  It's all so one-sided.  It's a casino.  It's a casino where you know the house has the odds, and they'll beat you every time.  Oh, yeah.  Travis has been waiting.  What's up, Travis?  Travis, Derek pointed out a story which is true, that up until two years ago, we were  paying a tax on our phone bills to pay off the Spanish-American War. 
[00:28:00]  Come on!  Shut up!  Go to Snopes!  It's in USA Today.  For 108 years, we paid a 3% federal tax on long-distance calls to pay off the Spanish-American  War.  The Spanish-American War!  Get out of here!  Are you kidding?  I'm dead serious.  But hey, it's paid off.  It finally ended, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's been over for two years.  Who's asking for that money?  Yeah.  Who's the one going, make up my need that money?  You owe me for that anvil. 
[00:28:30]  Who fucking made a purchase in the Spanish-American War?  That's amazing.  How do we get dumb country?  Oh, that is stupid.  All right.  Thanks for the text, Travis.  Travis reminded me to bring in my lost DVD, which I have signed already by a couple of the  cast members.  A few other cast members.  And now...  Who's coming in?  Harold?  Yes.  How do you say his last name?  Perinoe?  I think Perinoe.  I just call him Michael from Lost.  Do you know what's amazingly interesting? 
[00:29:00]  I have a lost DVD with signatures on it, but I brought in a new one to get signed.  What did you bring in?  I brought in season one, so I would have a couple of different ones, because you can't  fit them all on one.  Oh, I'm going to try, Jimmy.  I'm going to try with all my heart.  It's fun to try to get them all on one there, Jimmy.  Then you can display it nice.  Yay!  We got Bill Burr stopping by in about an hour, and Don King just canceled.  We love Don King, but I guess he canceled all press today.  Uh-oh.  What's breaking in his world?  What scandal is coming? 
[00:29:30]  He's either getting late or he's not feeling well.  It's either a really good reason, or he's got the shit.  We all know it's not a haircut.  Oh, gosh.  You know, you're probably right.  Oh, literal Jim.  We're not going to get to all these calls, so really quick.  Victor the trucker, only change Obama promised, is coming from our pockets.  A lot of people saying that.  Paul in Jersey, they tax unemployment cash, and it's taxpayers' money.  It's taxed money that they get taxed from. 
[00:30:00]  Chris in West Point, government spending $4 million trying to outsource contractors to other states.  Jim in Baltimore, Obama's taking 500 people to the G20 summit.  What?  Yeah, he's winging around Europe.  Like the stones.  He's winging on over to London.  Yeah, jam with the stones.  He's going to England.  Might as well.  And boy, I'll tell you, that Obama sure does like that Air Force One.  Oh, does he love it?  The guy has done more traveling than any president in full term so far. 
[00:30:30]  He loves that Air Force One.  That's his hoopty.  That is his hoopty.  He wants to see what this hoopty can do.  That's a mad ride, that Air Force One.  It looks like WED in Pennsylvania had girl with cell phone and new car pickup welfare check.  That's always good to hear.  Lest the trucker.  All cars are going to end up taxed like trucks.  Oh, man.  Do they tax the truckers?  Yeah.  And Mark in Jersey, how come when people sue, it's tax-free? 
[00:31:00]  What?  I don't know that one.  I don't know.  That's one I don't know.  But I don't know.  Mark in Michigan, how are you, Mark?  Hey, Mac.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Marky.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you killed on Hannity last night.  Thank you, man.  And you know what?  You did really well with your hands.  I was watching them.  It's funny.  I don't pretend we're friends or anything like that.  But when you know somebody and you watch them on TV, you know, it's just to stay fixated on certain things.  Thanks, man.  And it's like your hands.  Yeah.  Well, we got a little audio from Norton on Hannity last night. 
[00:31:30]  I want to start with the intro.  He better gave us the fine Jay Leno intro.  Well, I don't think, you know, it's kind of hard to get a Jay Leno type intro.  Me better.  Everybody should follow suit and give us the Jay Leno intro.  All I could look at the whole time, by the way, because we were sitting, I was sitting next to Sean.  It's like to the left is the monitor.  Like your eyesight is forward and left.  Yeah.  My fucking head.  I'm like, who is that talking bullfrog on television?  Oh, shit.  There's a talking bullfrog.  I'm looking at right now.  What a fat necked boob. 
[00:32:00]  Holy shit.  A talking bullfrog.  Oh, that won't haunt you for the next month with animations and everything else.  That's absolutely fine.  Ribbit.  There's a sound clip.  Ribbit.  Are we going to do a little animation festival?  Are we bringing back the animation festival?  Because now I'm thinking the talking bullfrog would be a great animation for him.  Would be.  We got to work on that.  Here's Jimmy on Hannity. 
[00:32:30]  And he's a radio host, comedian, and star of the HBO series Down and Dirty.  Jim Norton is with us.  Do not let your kids watch him.  Ever.  I'm kidding.  Thank you.  Oh, come on.  Well, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  All right.  Wow.  Sean.  Jesus.  A little awkward there for everybody.  Sean worries.  He is.  He has a worry wart.  I'll tell you why, because we go out live.  When you do that, you're on live.  Whereas Red Eye is taped, so if you truly fuck up, they can fix it.  Yeah.  But Sean is just like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like you guys have an understanding.  He's making eye contact and you can hear him going, please. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Please just don't say fuck.  Please.  Yeah.  I trust you.  Please don't do this to me.  Greg on Red Eye was freaking out when I was there because one of the girls on the panel,  the one that was on live via television, we were talking about Obama and how Obama was  trying to equate the economy and the banks with a suicide bomber.  And he's saying, you know, the guy's got the hand on the trigger and he's got the explosives  around him. 
[00:33:30]  And he went into this whole thing that made no sense.  It was really stupid.  And it was just proving Obama should not go off with the teleprompter.  And this girl said, well, I won't even repeat it.  But she was kind of insinuating that perhaps somebody that made that statement should  have explosives put on him.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  And Greg at that point was just like when they went to the next break, he goes, we got  to cut that out.  We got to cut that out.  Now we got to find something to put there.  He goes, you can't say that.  You can't be talking about the president. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  So that made a big to do.  He's right.  That was live.  Oh, yeah.  Situation.  Yeah.  If that was live, you know.  So there's the point.  I'll actually ask him about it when I do Red Eye tonight.  I'll sit there and I'll say.  Oh, you got that tonight.  Yeah.  It was actually a back-to-back night.  Oh, cool.  Look at that.  Very nice.  Well, he said radio show host.  Well, Greg should come in today then.  Do a few minutes with us to promote his little show.  Because I was on with that guy, Dennis Prager, who I've heard the name before.  Yeah, he's a radio guy.  He has a great voice.  But is he like a fucking, he's like a real conservative dude, right?  Yeah, he's a very safe broadcaster. 
[00:34:30]  He's like a responsible broadcaster.  Oh, yeah.  He's responsible.  He's in the responsible category.  He had his like wife and young son there and everybody was pleasant.  My young son.  I happen to have my young son in the studio.  But there's something dark about that guy because I don't know if they, there was a  point where he was talking about his, he wants to write a book or something called  Your Husband Is Not A Pervert where he discusses, because he told me that off the air and then  he repeated it on the air about male sexuality.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, oh boy, this guy has a doozy he wants to drop on someone. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, right?  He's right in.  Go with that one.  Sean asked Jim if people around the country support Obama.  Let me ask, you, you do a comedy tour.  You see people all over the country.  Do they support this?  Are they laughing?  Are they crying?  I'm crying.  I don't know what they feel.  I'm just trying to get women drunk after the show.  Get them back to the hotel.  I never ask them politically.  I'm just, whatever they say, I agree with.  If she's hot, if she's a liberal.  Yeah, me too.  I hate the Republicans.  I'm a worm, Sean.  Oh, that's terrible.  Come on, you've got a serious side. 
[00:35:30]  I've heard, I've seen it.  I mean, look, some people do, some people don't.  I mean, it depends on where you go in the country.  New York, Los Angeles, I mean, yeah, they support Obama.  You know, you do a gig somewhere in western Pennsylvania, they probably, uh.  Do you change your act based on the audience?  No, not at all.  I mean, it's awful no matter where I go.  All right.  Fair enough.  God bless Sean.  He's a weird individual.  Sean is an oddball.  Because he's like, he's such a safe guy, but he has this dangerous side about him.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you and I have done the show, Ant's doing it solo soon. 
[00:36:00]  You do the show.  It's like that weird, like.  April 16th.  Yeah, he's got that weird edge about him.  I think he secretly wants to be like a shock jock or something.  Shock jockery.  I think he secretly wants to get women nude in a radio station.  It's hard to squeeze in on that show.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is, too?  Now that I've noticed, especially when, like, Jim is on, and it's just the Hannity show now,  he is a little more leery about what you're saying.  Sure.  And he's trying to, I think he's trying to stay a couple of steps ahead of you to see where 
[00:36:30]  you're going, and it distracts him a little bit.  It's like, it's like, because he even told me, I tell you that every time you're on,  like, you said to me off there.  I'm like, I know, he just panics because you look at his audience is, you know, pretty  much the conservatives across the country, which goes from, like, you know, like, say  guys like Ant who are fiscally conservative and guys like fucking the moral majority.  Right, yeah.  It's like his audience covers all those people.  Uh-huh.  So I feel like I'm the alcoholic girlfriend on a date. 
[00:37:00]  And I feel like Sean is worried that I'm going to, like, say something, like, pull  a Fredo's wife thing, never marry a wife.  And he's trying to, like, tell the waiter, just fill his drinks with water, fill his drinks  with water.  Like, he's panicking.  I'm like, I'm not going to say anything, I promise.  Oh, that's classic.  Yeah, he gets a little panicky with that, definitely.  Let's get back into it.  Jim Norton on Sean Hannity last night.  He's a hypocrite.  No, that's not fair.  That's not fair?  That's not fair.  Those were security lights that were on.  Okay, and how about his private jet that we caught him on video with? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, that I can't help you with.  Yeah, okay, you can't help him with.  What happened was this, Al Gore has really ballooned up since he left office.  The light people saw us from his refrigerator door being open.  That's where all the fluorescent came from.  Thank you.  I wasn't sure that was going to go over.  I'm glad everybody talked about him over.  I'm going to subscribe to HBO because of meeting you tonight, I must tell you.  Hey, by the way, you're...  That's Dennis Prager.  Was he?  Yeah.  Prager, yeah.  Prager, was he enjoying your...  He was great, yeah.  Awesome.  I must tell you.  I'm going to do it on HBO.  I must tell you.  I was in the dressing room, right? 
[00:38:00]  And I'm sitting there, and the woman was...  I was nude.  I tend to sit in Sean's dressing room nude with my legs spread apart waiting for people  to come in.  And I greet them like that.  Oh, I didn't know you were going to be in here.  That's a good icebreaker.  Yeah.  So I'm sitting there, and the woman came up who I sat next to.  She was very nice.  She worked for some big...  She had worked for like...  She's a dem.  Al Gore.  She worked for a lot of the big ones, and she was a little nervous.  We were talking, and then some other people came up, like this young guy who was like  a reverend with his wife, and they came up with another reverend, and then Dennis Prager 
[00:38:30]  came up with his wife, and he's got like a stepson, and Dennis was just kind of...  What the hell's going on over there at that Hannity show?  I don't know, but guess who was the outcast sitting there tweetering?  Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  They were all chatting and introducing each other, and I'm sitting there like the fuck  fucking...  Just like the Black Plague.  Fucking tweeting.  And I know they're like, who is this asshole?  But they're all having responsible adult conversations, talking about Judaism and Catholicism, and having  a really pleasant chat. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, is this going to be an atrocity tonight?  They're going to hate my guts.  But the cameras are on, everybody's fine.  Bring in another person from your side, man.  Bounce it out a little bit.  What the hell?  Well, they had the Democrat and the Republican, the kind of conservative.  But Dennis Prager, I want to know fucking...  That guy, I was surprised when he said, the book he wants to write is called, Your Husband  Is Not a Pervert.  Yeah.  I would love to know what he was getting at, because he just...  Yeah, yeah.  He seemed like he was saying that men think a certain way.  It's like, you should be able to enjoy this, this, without being called a pervert. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  Perhaps a pile of bones are ready to fall out of his closet.  Yeah, something happens.  He's trying to stay ahead of it.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a talk he needs to have with somebody.  Jim talks about Europe liking Obama.  Go ahead.  No, go ahead.  Go ahead, Mr. Gordon.  I kind of like the fact that Obama's going...  I don't like Europe.  I've had enough of them.  You know, they really bug me.  But I think that he's like a rock star over there.  And I kind of want a president to be liked.  I mean, he's the...  Why? 
[00:40:00]  Why do we care with the French thing?  I know, technically you're right.  It's better than being hated.  But it's just nice.  Sometimes it's just nice to be liked.  Would it be nice?  All right, where would Europe be?  Wasn't it the U.S. that beat fascism, Nazism, totalitarianism, communism, imperial Japan,  and we're now bearing the brunt of fighting terrorism?  All European ideas, by the way.  Marxism, fascism, Nazism, all European creations.  I'm not saying Europe isn't awful.  Believe me, I mean, they're horrible.  That wasn't a hard switch.  Their idea of helping is sending a bunch of camouflaged shamwows.  I mean, they're worthless at a time of war. 
[00:40:30]  They stink.  All right, now.  Very good.  And then we got more Dennis Prager right here talking about...  Oh, talking about his book.  This is what you're getting at, Jimmy.  The great voice.  The guy has...  When you walk into the studio, I'm like, you have a phenomenal voice.  He's like, that's a little...  Thank you.  Yeah.  Dennis Prager's working on a book, and we were talking about this during the break.  Working title is...  Your husband is not a pervert, an explanation of men and their sexual nature.  And I suggested you and Norton, considering this is about... 
[00:41:00]  Go on the road.  What is the premise of the book?  Well, I've done this on my radio show for years now.  I've talked about male sexual nature.  I've put out CDs on it.  Women have come over to me at lectures around the country.  And this is the God's honest truth.  And said, you saved my marriage.  I now understand my husband.  I thought he was a pervert.  I thought he was a nut.  I thought he was sick or whatever.  Male sexual nature is so different from female sexual nature.  And men are so afraid to tell their wives what it's really about because they'll think  they're sick. 
[00:41:30]  I'm going to stay out of topics that I know little or nothing about.  I know my limits.  Do you agree with this?  I am...  I'll wait for the book to come out before I comment.  All right.  Now, that's not what you said during the break.  But I will let you off the hook if you demand it.  But that's not what you said during the break.  I want to spend 10 minutes with Dennis and get him to change the title of his book.  To what?  To?  I don't know.  Just a few minutes with my stories.  And believe me, you will realize that there are some of us that are perverts.  Well, I was putting you on the cover, actually.  Is that right?  I was trying to whore a happy endings plug. 
[00:42:00]  You certainly were.  I couldn't think I had to squeeze it in.  You were one line away from saying happy endings.  I just had to go for the joke.  I was like, Adam.  Just short.  You and Pryg are getting along there, Jimmy.  Again, I knew the name.  He needs to like you.  And I saw his face.  I'm like, I know this guy's voice.  I know who he is.  But is he like one of the talker dudes?  He's always on that list.  Talkers.  He's pleasant.  That's all you hear. 
[00:42:30]  But I know I've heard that voice before.  The guy, it's like, you know, he's probably a very responsible broadcaster.  Oh, yeah.  Probably a polite conversation.  Oh, suck jockery there.  No.  But yeah, Sean's where he's a little bit.  One more clip of Norton on Hannity last night.  Would you support Palin?  Oh, I'd have to see who the candidates are and what the situation is at the time.  But I have no doubt on my...  Exit question.  Reaction to that and who would be the Republican choice for you in 2012?  I don't know who the choice would be, but God bless McCain for being polite. 
[00:43:00]  You know, that's like when someone shows you a picture of their fat wife and you're like,  oh, she's lovely.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  He was trying to be nice, you know?  Yeah.  I didn't know what he meant by exit question, though.  I didn't know that's a very quick boom, boom, boom.  Why is the media still taking it seriously that Palin actually has a shot at the presidency anytime soon?  That's ridiculous.  I know.  She was a complete bust in the end.  You know what, though?  Maybe in another eight years or something.  Who knows?  When they ask Republicans, if they ask Democrats, they just laugh at her. 
[00:43:30]  And they ask Republicans, and no one commits.  Like, you hear it's like, you know, well, I have to see who the other person is on the ticket.  You know, she's a very respected person in this.  But you never hear like, yeah, I'd vote for her.  Right.  You don't have to worry about that.  Someone's got to...  How about a little honesty and go, look, she was a bust for our party.  You know, we thought we had something and she just wasn't ready.  Makes the party look stupid, so you can't say that.  Yeah, I understand.  So you've got to, you know, mince words. 
[00:44:00]  But it is kind of a...  It is a bit of an awkward question where he's not saying, yeah, I would support her.  Because she was good enough to run the country if something happened to McCain.  Like, he's basically, by picking her as vice president, he's going, look, if I die, she's it.  Yeah.  But like, would you support her?  Ah, maybe.  Ah.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened there?  What do you mean?  What did you learn that you're not liking?  It's like he was just trying to be nice.  He's being nice.  And there's a woman right now on Channel 11 who I really am sexually attracted to. 
[00:44:30]  You like that, Tim?  I really do.  Who is that blonde lady?  I don't know.  She's got a book or something?  I don't know.  I think it said Candy Girl or something, whatever that means.  What is Candy Girl?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You like that, Jimmy?  Hopefully, if you say it three times, she appears.  Kind of like Candy Man.  Candy Man.  Why don't we take a break?  We got lots to do today.  We got Bill Burris stopping in, the dude from Lost, and Oz, you guys were saying.  He's a wheelchair guy in Oz?  Yes, he is.  And he's got a new show.  I didn't see Oz either, really. 
[00:45:00]  New show coming on after Lost, I believe.  Is he still part of the Lost thing?  It's hard to say.  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  I know.  It is very hard, especially with the flashbacks and flash forwards and things like that.  You never know who's going to pop up, and people that are able to see the dead.  Right.  You know, there's just, eh.  Did he have some weird demise in Lost?  Well, you could say that.  Oh, boy.  You could absolutely say that.  And he was not happy about it publicly.  No, huh?  He spoke about it publicly. 
[00:45:30]  He wasn't, he made a point.  I mean, it's like, sometimes you hear black actors or whatever commenting on Hollywood,  and you're like, all right.  And then there's times, like, I noticed.  I didn't know he made this quote.  Like, there's really not good black characters on Lost.  Like, there are literally, there was one.  There was one, and then he decided to fucking leave.  And then he, but they got, he was gone.  And then Mr. Echo.  Echo was good.  And then he was gone, but I heard he was difficult to work with.  It's like, but it's like, they just keep replacing them with, like, you know, the red-headed  girl, and the, it's like, I kind of get it, like. 
[00:46:00]  I'm so lost.  Well, let's be real.  I'm lost.  Who's watching this show?  Let's look at the demo.  Dude, that's exactly, that is exactly what it is.  But if you're, but it's still, I didn't mind watching Mr. Echo.  I loved him.  I didn't mind watching Black actors.  But it's like, it's like, there are certain shows that, you know, appeal to black people.  All the shows that used to be on WB or whatever the hell it's called now and stuff like that.  I can't even remember some of the names of these things.  But it was like, you know, the Paul Harvey show. 
[00:46:30]  I don't see a lot of white people tuning in.  Paul Harvey or Steve Harvey?  Steve Harvey.  Paul Harvey.  No one's tuning into Paul Harvey either.  Paul Harvey had the opposite audience.  The Steve Harvey show.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to watch him.  But you're not even new.  Is this the news?  I don't know what this is.  Why do they got the fat one trying to look sexy?  What is she doing?  It's all cute and all, but, you know.  Big fat monster with her slacks.  Big fat cell with slacks.  Yeah, stay behind the counter.  Slack.  Fat girl with slacks. 
[00:47:00]  Or the desk, whatever.  No, it's, it's, even though, yeah, of course it's a big white audience.  But on a show like, those are like more niche shows.  Like, when you get a smaller show like on WB.  Yeah.  They're, uh, you're not going to get that massive an audience.  I mean, but when you have a show, it's like arguably the biggest show on TV.  Uh-huh.  If, if it's, it's like, yeah, I don't, I, a little bit.  Just to make it realistic.  Yeah, I got you.  It's like a fucking plane crashed.  We've all been on planes.  Well, you have, uh, you have, uh, the, uh.  They're not all white people.  They're not going from utopia to heaven.  You have the white guy that's married to the, uh, the black woman. 
[00:47:30]  Exactly.  The big, safe, matronly woman.  She's on.  There was nothing useful that came out of that couple.  Nothing.  The whole show.  The backstory was good, though.  Their backstory was good.  Yeah, the backstory was good.  And, eh, it's because it's a little dramatic backstory.  That was really good, actually.  But as far as the island goes, if they were there or not, no one would notice.  No one gave a fuck.  Nothing would care.  Nothing would happen differently.  The smoke wouldn't even eat them.  Who cares?  Smoke would be like, beat it.  But he gives a shit.  It's pretty cool, though. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, and he, he, was he angry?  Because I know he was gone for quite a while.  He was mad they wrote him off.  I think he was mad they wrote, again, I, I, I think he was mad they wrote him off.  And then he was mad at the, at the demise once he came back.  Like, but I really think it's got something to do with.  Ah, here's our resident lost expert.  He was, uh, he was upset because he left and then they, they begged him to come back.  And he was supposed to come back in season three, but that didn't happen.  And then once he finally agreed to come back, this is what I've read, um, that the strike 
[00:48:30]  made the, the, the writer's strike.  Yeah.  Forced them to kind of condense his story a little bit.  Oh, right.  Because there was less episodes, right?  Yeah.  So he was, he was upset that he came back.  He was in like a couple episodes and then he was killed.  Yeah.  Something tells me there was supposed to be a lot more going on with him and Walt and  why Walt was there with a grandmother, I guess, or something.  I'm going to ask him if it's because.  Like, that got glazed over.  If it's because Walt was older.  I tell you, I didn't realize he left because I'm, I thought they wrote him off. 
[00:49:00]  Because when a kid gets.  Took off on the boat with, uh, Walt and that was it.  Goodbye.  When a kid gets bigger, it's kind of hard to keep them, like you have to get a replacement  kid because they fucking, you know, all of a sudden the kid is 5'11".  Yeah.  How old are you?  13.  Oh, the kid, the kid got so big.  It was ridiculous.  They should have recast him.  I got one of those Rodney Allen Rippey kids or a kid with a kidney problem.  Yeah, you gotta get one with a kidney problem.  You gotta get one with a kidney problem.  Keep some nice and small.  Yeah.  That's what I'd be doing if I had a kid character in a show.  I'd be fucking perusing the kidney hospitals.  I'd look at the kidney transplant list. 
[00:49:30]  Uh, 12, can he act?  Yeah.  I worked fine in the old days.  Yeah.  I gotta watch this Lost.  I'm so out of this conversation.  I just started watching season one again and, uh, I'm just enjoying it all over again  because I've forgotten so much of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, you forget like, oh yeah, oh yeah.  And then you just start with the backstories.  It's on sci-fi, uh, and occasionally I'll be watching something on sci-fi.  Like I think yesterday I was watching The Outer Limits or something and then I fell 
[00:50:00]  asleep and woke up and Lost was on and it was an old episode and I'm like, holy jeez,  I barely remember this.  Yeah.  I like it.  It's like, oh, so much has happened to us.  I feel like it's us.  So much has happened to us since then.  You're just part of it now.  Of course I am.  You know, there's a popular internet theory that Rose and Bernard are Adam and Eve.  Stop it!  I'm dead serious.  I'm gonna go with that one.  I don't necessarily believe it.  Why would you?  That stinks.  It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  I would love it.  Oh, really? 
[00:50:30]  I beg to differ.  I think it would be great if that whole series ended up revolving around Rose and Bernard.  Oh, God, would that be awful?  They're all of a sudden the be all, end all of Lost.  Oh, no, they're useless on that show.  They're not Adam and Eve.  No.  At all.  Vincent.  Maybe she had ribs, but...  She's a black woman.  You understand?  Why don't we hit a break here?  So we got Harold Perrineau.  Yes.  So we'll talk to him about some of these things you guys have mentioned here. 
[00:51:00]  He's been on some huge fucking series, man.  Yeah.  I mean, Oz and Lost are two big ones.  Absolutely.  Then the helicopter pilot in 28 Weeks Later.  Like, what?  That's pretty cool.  Pops up in that.  And the Matrix, also.  Yeah, the Matrix.  Matrix action, that's right.  Yeah.  And we got stuff to give away to the fans that show up today.  I see an Islander jersey.  I see...  What's the red jersey?  It could either be a...  An Islander jersey.  Oh.  I'm going to guess...  I'm going to guess devils, but it could be a Bulls thing, maybe. 
[00:51:30]  It is a Bulls?  With Opie's name on it.  Oh, I got Opie and Jimmy.  Oh, the Chicago.  Remember when we went to Chicago, they gave us the dumb jerseys that we never wore?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  All right.  A Bulls jersey with my name on it and Jimmy's name on it.  I got an Islander jersey.  I believe Anthony's name is on the Islander jersey.  Is it?  I believe so, yeah.  You don't wear them with your name on them, Opie?  I'm not a big fan of wearing my name.  Oh, wow.  Nope.  An Anthony one.  By the way...  If you want to give me something, just don't put my name on it.  The stuff we gave away yesterday, like the books that we gave away...  Yeah.  There was a bunch of them. 
[00:52:00]  The top book was that book called...  Bromance.  No, but Bromance.  Who wants to laugh that much?  The Stephen King one.  No, I should...  Lisey's story, I should have brought that.  Right.  But it was a fucking...  The book about headshots.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Where it has like a hundred old headshots.  And not even old.  Some of them are new.  And there are people who just haven't made it in Hollywood.  And in a way, it seems like there's kind of shit on the people.  Yeah.  But they're basically just showing the headshot and the resume.  There are fucking horrendous headshots. 
[00:52:30]  But God, I could not stop looking at this book.  This is an author.  We should go back and get this guy.  No kidding, really?  Dude, it's such an interesting book.  It could be the greatest toilet book ever.  Wow.  But it's only once through.  Yeah, I had a good crapper book.  Oh, my God.  We got the...  We can't give away the Jeff Norris CD today.  Gorilla Boy, wow.  Tropicana?  What's that?  Starring Jeff Norris.  It's a movie he made?  I don't know.  All right, well, we're giving that away to somebody in the audience.  What the hell is this? 
[00:53:00]  Worms Dirt?  That is an autographed cup of dirt from Brian Regan.  Cup of dirt.  Holy shit.  This is worth something.  It's a gummy worms and dirt thing that Brian Regan signed.  Cup of dirt.  So you get your little cup of dirt in it.  And then we got the I'm Over Here Now, Dice's 2000 Because You Said Tour.  Wow.  Because you said.  Because you said.  It is the worst.  Look, you know, nothing against Dice, but this is the worst hat ever.  What's wrong with the hat? 
[00:53:30]  Try to put that hat on there.  So is the hat.  It's one of those floppy hats.  Yeah, but there's not enough room for your head.  It's not like a cap.  Watch what this looks like.  It's a beanie.  Oh my God.  I gotta take a picture.  That hat is.  It's like a Rick Nielsen hat.  Oh, I got my first tweet for today.  Starring then.  I already tweeted it.  No, you didn't.  I tweeted.  I have it implanted in my head.  I just got blink.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on, Daddy.  That fucking hat.  That looks like the type of thing Vic Morrow wore in Blackboard Jungle. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to say in his last movie.  No.  You should have been wearing that.  All right.  Whatever.  See his head go flying off with that stupid hat on it.  Yeah.  So we got some good stuff to give away.  The Brian Regan thing.  I sort of want to take this home.  Yeah, really?  It's famous.  An autographed cup of dirt.  Nah, we'll give it to the audience.  I'm amazed.  Oh, and Jeff Norr signed his Jeff Norr CD?  And what's that, Sam?  Oh, God.  Don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  What is it?  What is it? 
[00:54:30]  That's the O.B. and Anthony virus hat that Eric has been wearing for three years, four  years.  Ew.  And it looks it, man.  Where the fuck did you find that?  Look at all the sweat on the hat.  Don't you ever throw your hats in a fucking washing machine?  Yeah, but I also thought...  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  But I also thought I threw that out.  Here's my question.  It probably has no smell on it, though.  Who's going to smell the inside of your box hat for him?  I don't think it's that.  Oof.  Oh.  Is there anything there, O.B.?  It just smells like attic-y. 
[00:55:00]  Okay.  Like it was in an attic.  Yeah.  That's flooded.  And I know it's tough to flood an attic, but think...  A little mildew.  Who's on top of an empty room.  Think Hurricane Katrina.  Want to smell it to me?  No, I certainly don't.  No.  Well, thank you.  There's no smelling going on there.  That's an easy one to do.  Another cup of dirt.  Jesus.  Signed by Brian Regan.  That just halved the value.  Yeah, no kidding.  Exactly.  Yeah, we have to destroy one, so the listener has a fine item.  I am amazed this early. 
[00:55:30]  Look how many people are here already.  I'm not looking.  Fuck them.  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't look at the audience.  The bleachers almost filled up already.  Oh, wow.  That's because it's the last week before we go over to the exciting big building where  we're going to be treated like shit.  Ooh.  Oh, Jimmy's making the sound of a handsome young man being found out there.  Yes, he is.  No, I think we're going to be treated well over at the building.  I think they're looking forward to it.  Yeah.  Let me show you a couple emails.  Oh, bizarro, Jim.  Yeah, let me show you a couple emails that came in the last couple of days. 
[00:56:00]  No, somebody got hurt tripping over the streamers that they're hanging for us.  Yeah.  Be careful with those streamers.  The streamers, welcome, albeit it's hanging on the wind, and they're all like, we want  a welcome sign.  How many welcome signs?  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Yeah, I just can't picture the welcome signs.  At this point, I can't even keep track of all the things they've taken away from us.  It's amazing.  I sort of had it all in my head, and I've lost track now.  When the big thing was to make us better and give us the support we never got. 
[00:56:30]  Red paddle, red paddle, red paddle.  All right.  Where is the paddle today?  I don't know.  I was using theater in the mind.  All right, here's the red paddle.  Everybody actually thought I did it.  All right.  There we go.  Anthony just gave me the red paddle.  Red paddle.  All right, I'm done with that.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll get into some other things.  Things!  We might have to start doing the Twitter story of the day.  Twitter story of the day.  Every effing day, there's a Twitter story.  We'll do your Twitter story of the day next.  I'm going to twit my coffee cup. 
[00:57:00]  That's crazy, Jimmy.  That's insane.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to twit my coffee cup.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right, thanks.  I'm going to twit my coffee cup, and we'll get another paper cup.  We'll take that in.  And then there's a map.  I don't know.  I was going to leave a bar.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. </pre>
