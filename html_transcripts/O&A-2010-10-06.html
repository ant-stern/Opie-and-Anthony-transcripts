<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts self-deprecatingly labeling their own show "stupid," "irresponsible," and "unethical."  This led to a discussion about Opie's hatred of small talk, triggered by a detailed, sarcastic conversation with Anthony, Sam, Travis, and E-Rock about the intricacies of online banking and accessing old records.  This morphed into a humorous hypothetical involving a suggestive image on a deposited check and anecdotes about uncomfortable celebrity encounters, particularly a cringeworthy meeting with Phil Collins.  A lengthy, opinionated debate on Genesis' musical career followed.  A listener, "River Rat," was briefly mentioned before the discussion returned to the aversion to small talk, with stories from a Harry Potter premiere and a bizarre tangent about racial dynamics in school, referencing *Blackboard Jungle* and *To Serve With Love*. A call from "Pirate Trucker" briefly interrupted.  The conversation then shifted to sports, covering Randy Moss, the Patriots, LeBron James, Dwayne Wade's injury, and a positive review of the dark humor in *Cable Guy*.  Jimmy's upcoming Fios internet switch and his plans to destroy his Time Warner Cable equipment were mentioned, leading to a discussion about an attractive News 12 Long Island anchor (whose name they couldn't recall) and the tragic suicide of a Rutgers student who was cyberbullied and outed via webcam.  This prompted a discussion of the legal ramifications and the hosts' own childhood bullying experiences.

The show continued with a focus on the Rutgers student's suicide and the complexities of prosecuting the perpetrator.  This segued into a vitriolic attack on Perez Hilton,  using highly offensive language, accusing him of being a major cyberbully, and citing instances of digitally altered celebrity photos.  The hosts cynically discussed celebrity involvement in anti-cyberbullying campaigns, derisively mentioning George Clooney, Kathy Griffin, Cindy Lauper, and Brett Favre. Audio clips of Perez Hilton, Wendy Williams, Lance Bass, Tim Gunn, and Chris Colfer discussing cyberbullying were played, interspersed with further offensive remarks and tangents about celebrities' alleged drug use and sexual orientations.  A Dane Cook video on bullying was discussed and criticized, and other unrelated topics such as *Back to the Future*, Lady Gaga's outfits, and Metallica's "The Memory Remains" video (including a purported Daniel Mustard cameo) were brought up.

The next segment started with a discussion about a childhood game called "Undie Flip," detailed by Travis, involving nudity and his brother.  This transitioned back to bullying and suicide, with clips from Cindy Lauper and Ellen DeGeneres on the topic.  The hosts discussed invasion of privacy in media and celebrity culture, again using Perez Hilton as an example, while a caller, Brendan, joined the critique of Hilton's hypocrisy. The segment concluded with "Jocktober," a critical analysis of the Pittsburgh radio show "The Morning Freak Show with Big Bob and Mikey," and a bizarre moment involving smelling and commenting on a guest's belly button.

The critique of Big Bob and Mikey's show initially aimed for constructive criticism, but this changed when they discovered the hosts were O&A fans and had even created a jingle, "XM202 Suck My Buggy Cock," years earlier.  The analysis of their "Office Monkeys" segment led to a heated argument with producer Sam, who was heavily ridiculed and insulted by Opie and Anthony, and numerous listener comments from Twitter.  Offensive language, homophobic slurs, and threats of violence toward Sam were frequent.  After significant back and forth, the hosts conceded the show was good, praising its structure and use of sarcasm.  Further discussion of Big Bob and Mikey's show, interspersed with criticism of Sam, and clips of Sam's radio show followed, culminating in a phone call from Big Bob and Mikey offering a profuse apology. *Dancing with the Stars* (David Hasselhoff and The Situation) was also briefly discussed.

The final segment focused on Sirius XM Hits 1 DJ "Club Soda Kenny," analyzing his helium-infused announcements and questionable on-air behavior.  The hosts debated the entertainment value versus offensiveness of his intoxicated, curse-filled, and sexually suggestive style.  Numerous live reads (Gamefly, Norton Internet Security, Steven Singer Jewelers – IHateStevenSinger.com) were included.  Banter with Sam Roberts escalated into insults and mockery of his appearance and career, touching upon potential cyberbullying. A recurring joke about Kenny's long song outros persisted.  Jimmy Norton's upcoming Foxwoods appearance was also mentioned.  The segment maintained a highly irreverent and crass tone, filled with sexually explicit jokes and homophobic slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  Look who's back again for another day.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ah, us.  Ho, ho. 
[00:01:00]  Ho, ho.  Just slap that smile.  I want to thank Anthony.  For this shit one more time.  I want to thank you.  Yes?  I realized today.  I've been around a while.  Yeah.  I realized today, for the first time, that I hate small talk.  And I brought that out.  I can't stand small talk.  I was small talking with the guys.  Anthony just loves small talking.  They were talking about online banking.  Sam, Travis.  No, you were trying to pull everyone in.  It was you and E-Rock.  And E-Rock was excited that he was having a conversation with you, first of all. 
[00:01:30]  He really was, first of all.  It was the first one ever.  And I'm looking at E-Rock, like, why are you excited to finally talk to Anthony?  You're talking about online banking.  And it wasn't like a quick little, do you online bank?  No, I do.  All right, whatever.  What happened last night?  It was, like, on and on and on and on and on.  We got into the whole log-on procedure.  The log-on procedure.  And then I looked over and noticed Opie chewing his Pop-Tart and then making a face.  And a delicious Pop-Tart. 
[00:02:00]  There you go.  But making a face like he was eating shit listening to us.  It was this, ugh, like, shut up.  The small talk.  I hate small talk.  It is just babble.  I realize that.  How horrible.  Family functions.  I just shut my mouth.  Because I don't.  What?  What are you going to say?  What?  We're small talking.  About nothing.  I figure it gives me, eh, about a month of fat jokes on the poor little feller.  If I just treat him nice before the show.  You know, without the listeners hearing the niceties. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, they never get to hear the nice, uh, or being nice to everybody.  Of course not.  Wow.  So you mean you're going to rope him in by chit-chatting with him to a bunch of fat jokes?  Yeah.  As long as I chit-chat nice about online banking.  Online banking?  Then, uh, you know.  If that doesn't, if that doesn't show you that you don't like E-Rock.  It's very convenient, Opie.  Why would you do that to him?  I gotta tell you.  You put in your password, your fucking account number, and you're banking. 
[00:03:00]  I do online banking.  You're banking.  Oh my god, we're small talking again.  No, this is a good one.  Oh my god.  I could talk online banking until the cows come home.  Oh my god, please don't.  Don't you love it?  I'll tell you what I hate about it though.  Until E-Rock comes home?  See, hence the niceties.  I'll tell you what I hate about online banking though.  When you have to get something from eight months ago for your taxes, they only keep it for 18 months.  They don't keep your, it's like, it's a fucking computer record, you faggots.  And that's how I talk to them.  But your math didn't work there.  You said you need something from eight months ago, but they only keep it for 18 months. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I should have said it a year before because in corporations you pay a weird time.  But if you call them, they will absolutely send it.  I have called them, you have to send it.  I can't just look at it.  I want to look at it.  It takes a day.  I want to look at it there.  Relax, Jimmy.  It's a computer.  It should just be there.  Screen cap.  The whole thing.  Just keep screen cap.  No, you can't see it.  Your entire career at that bank should be available.  Dude.  I'm going back 17 years. 
[00:04:00]  I'm putting money in the bank.  Let me look at it.  No.  Are you?  Good luck.  Great.  What contract did you sign?  You're putting money in the bank.  You scared me.  I thought there was a banking fiasco happening.  No.  Much more withdrawal slips than deposits.  Jesus, I'm kidding.  Yeah.  No fucking kidding.  I'm banking on the big bucks.  No.  Wow.  You didn't like the small talk there?  I fucking hate it.  Ah, it was good.  We were talking, then Travis came in.  I'm like, Travis, B of A?  B of A? 
[00:04:30]  It's like, yeah, you know, whatever it takes.  Called her out, right?  Then we're talking about the pictures.  We take the pictures of the check.  And then you, you, uh.  Oh, I have that.  You got that.  See, Danny's got that.  You get a check.  You snap a photo of the front and the back of the check.  And then you send it to the bank.  The picture from your iPhone or something.  And it's deposited.  It's deposited.  Don't look at me, Puzzle Jimmy.  Wow.  Isn't that amazing?  I'll show you.  Write me a check.  It's Fanta. 
[00:05:00]  Write me a check.  That's, you could deposit.  Yes.  You take a picture of the front and the back.  You write it to yourself.  You could do it, anything.  Or it could just be like.  Oh, wait.  Someone else's check.  Someone sends you a check.  Oh, not your check.  Or your check.  You could write cash.  But then you'd just be depositing.  Take it for Peter to pay Paul.  Dude, you could deposit a check by photograph.  By photo.  Hoping I'll send the wrong one.  Oh, that would be good.  Well, the one side, it says $500.  And there's a cock picture on the back of that check.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Watch what you put in notes.  That's how you endorse it.  Four blow job.  Two bill.  Of course.  Gay.  Didn't take long.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Suck my cock.  You can do it with BOA, too?  Thanks, America.  I haven't done the BOA, taking the photo of the check.  Wow.  A little small talk.  I hear you.  All I'm doing is small talk.  I see you've got one little cube.  You gave me a chance to fucking eat my Pop-Tart.  That's what I'm waiting for.  It's Pop-Tart.  A little small talk. 
[00:06:00]  A little banter, I like to call it.  By the way, brown sugar cinnamon.  Smells very good, by the way.  It made the whole room smell wonderful.  Smell like a dream.  Jimmy, please fart and clear this out.  Believe me.  It's too delicious in here.  My farts are palate cleansers.  Yes, they are.  Do you like chit-chat at parties and stuff?  Small talk, chit-chat.  Not really, no.  I hate it.  I'm bad at it, too.  I'm really bad at it.  I am.  Dude.  I think if you do this for a living, you're even worse than the average person.  I'll tell you something.  A lot of people go, wow, he doesn't really fucking talk. 
[00:06:30]  I have nothing to say unless he's a man.  There's a mic in front of me.  Why would I talk to ten people when I could talk to a million?  Go fuck yourself.  True.  If you want to know what I have to say, then fucking listen to the radio show.  You can be a mic everywhere you go.  Right.  Go to a party with a microphone.  Hi, how you doing?  You look silly.  I don't know.  I can talk at parties to regular people, but it's hard to talk to celebrities.  If you're in an instance where you're backstage. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  I don't mean to laugh because you are a celebrity, but you're a pal.  But I mean, like, if you're backstage somewhere and there's a band, you don't know what to say.  Like the other day, Phil Collins in the back, we all have a story about the dumb fucking shit we said to Phil Collins.  What did you say?  I just went, hi.  And then I think I mentioned something about fucking the...  I just felt like I had to say something to him. 
[00:07:30]  Now I understand when the listeners come up to us and...  And just say something stupid.  Yeah, and they feel like they have to say something to us.  The bait is meant.  All bets are off now, I understand.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I fucking had to say something to Phil Collins and he could give a fuck.  I mentioned an American Psycho reference.  Oh, that's a good one.  Well, it wasn't good.  Studio?  Look at the picture.  It wasn't good.  I thought it was good.  I was like, I really like...  I said, I enjoy the way they used Susudio in American Psycho. 
[00:08:00]  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Folded his arms and looked at the camera miserably.  Snapped the picture.  And then I was like, thanks.  Yeah.  Gone.  Know what I said to him?  I said, I really want to thank you for selling out because I really don't think that Genesis was doing well enough.  I wish you said that.  I really appreciate all the fucking Disney songs you decided to do instead of more Genesis hits.  Thank you.  Thank you for that, Mr. Collins.  I heard you say I love the puppets in Land of Confusion. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Land of Confusion...  All right, I could handle it a little bit.  You know what?  At the time, it was a great video.  I could handle it a little bit.  Ronald Reagan, fucking spongy puppet.  I just said hi to him.  Margaret Thatcher.  I've tried to have moments.  I didn't with him.  I just said hi.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you.  The last cool Genesis song for me, and I used the word cool very loosely, was that Mama.  Ah, too fucking...  What else was off that album?  I forgot the name of the album, even. 
[00:09:00]  What was the last cool Genesis song before it got really just over-the-top shitty?  Illegal Alien is not...  I knew you were going to go there.  No, it's horrible.  It's horrendous.  It's no fun.  Yeah, this is the last Genesis song I kind of liked.  I don't like this.  It's too fucking plodding, and...  I like their poppy songs.  I like the songs that are poppy.  Let's see.  I like something you can cave a man's head into. 
[00:09:30]  Keep going, Danny.  With an axe.  We're going all the way down.  How do they do this?  You had the album cover one page back.  Okay, there you go.  Of course, I can feel it coming in the air tonight is like the fucking definitive...  When it was out, that was the coolest song ever.  I think it's Invisible Touch.  Really?  What's the name of the album?  Lil' Poppy.  I think. 
[00:10:00]  What's off this?  Invisible Touch, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight.  Oh, wow, it's not Invisible Touch.  Okay, it was the next album.  Sorry.  Uh, We Can't Dance, right?  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't know.  Let's see what's on there.  Where the fuck is mom at?  Oh, I just realized I'm out.  Yeah.  I don't know my Genesis albums anymore.  Must be earlier.  Get the fuck out of here.  This goes back to like 81 or 82, this song. 
[00:10:30]  I would think.  Holy shit.  I think this is old, dude.  Real fucking old.  Wait, he has to go to, uh...  Yeah, that's like 81.  Yeah, the master computer in here says it's off their self-titled album.  Wow.  Yeah.  What year?  I don't know.  January.  January.  January, year?  83.  80-what?  83.  83?  Oh.  Oh, man.  Man, I haven't liked this band in a couple decades. 
[00:11:00]  It's been quite a while.  Holy shit.  Are you serious?  I love how he still has that little landing strip on his head, though.  Yeah, barely.  Barely there, but it's still...  The rainforest is just about gone.  Eh.  It's almost precedent.  Is this Genesis?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't love this.  A lot of different sounds with Genesis.  They did evolve over the years.  There was the kind of, like, poppy shit that they did later on, and then this kind of, 
[00:11:30]  you know, moody stuff they did.  Was this the last good Genesis song?  I'm just saying good.  I'm not saying great.  I think it was the one before they really hit, like, pop.  Home by the Sea is really cool.  Yeah.  And that was off this album as well.  Yeah.  I hate the ha-ha-ha.  I hate this.  I hate this.  Stop with the land.  What's he doing?  Listen to this.  Listen, listen. 
[00:12:00]  What's he doing?  What is that?  Just don't do that in a song.  Stop.  He's being mysterious.  Wrecking.  You're wrecking it.  It's like that whore on the Who song we were talking about yesterday.  Ugh.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, not the Metallica song.  I actually like that.  I know I'm in the minority, too.  I did.  I really did.  You don't like the voices.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I like that.  I don't mind that either.  Oh.  And the memory remains?  It really isn't that bad.  Yeah, it's not that bad. 
[00:12:30]  I despise it.  Do you?  Like, it ruins the song for me.  It's such a weird thing in the song.  That's why.  It's too weird.  Hater.  Oh, I like it.  We don't have to listen the whole thing.  All right, Travis, we get it.  Look at how he looks at me.  Like, oh, what did you play to me?  Let me go to River Rat.  River Rat, what's up, brother?  Hey, I was just trying to shout out in time.  You were like, hey, what was a couple other songs? 
[00:13:00]  Paper Lake was one that, hey, it was a fucking cheesy song.  I didn't like it, but it didn't like it.  That's when the poppy Genesis started.  Was that song called Paper Lake or Paper Lake?  Paper Lake.  Yeah, Paper Lake.  I know.  I know.  A lot of people used to make that mistake.  It's written Paper Lake, last good song.  Yeah.  Who's screening?  I don't know.  Smack him in the head.  Are we really talking about Genesis?  I know.  Why?  Thank you, River Rat.  All right, thanks a lot.  All right, have a good day, brother. 
[00:13:30]  How did we get into small talk?  Is that small talk, you guys, right?  I think we're small talking.  Fuck, you're right.  But it can't be small talk if these mics are on.  That's true.  It's big small talk.  I would never have that conversation at a little fucking get together.  With anybody.  No.  Ever.  If someone started saying what we just said, I'd walk away.  I would be like, yeah.  I'd be like, oh, God, that guy wouldn't shut up about Genesis.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Keep me away from him.  The biggest complaint in my entire life, you just, you don't socialize enough. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  I'm like, I socialize for a fucking living.  Leave me alone.  Socialize with people I like.  This is downtime.  Yeah.  I get paid to talk.  I've been socializing since I was 18.  I'm going to shut my mouth and hit the button on my remote with my thumb.  Don't bug me.  That is an art form, though.  Ex-girlfriends and stuff.  You don't socialize.  I once had to go to a fucking Harry Potter movie, right?  When Harry Potter was really huge.  It was like one of the first movies. 
[00:14:30]  Equus?  We went with a bunch of...  Sick joke.  We went with a bunch of couples.  And it wasn't good enough that I went to the movie with a bunch of couples that I could  give a fuck about.  Then all of a sudden, I'm getting berated in line because I'm not small talking as we wait  to go into the theater.  Who are you supposed to talk to?  Nobody's.  That I had no interest in or nothing.  Stand on line.  At the time, it was her friends.  Wait.  So you talk to them.  What am I going to say to them?  I'll go in and see the movie. 
[00:15:00]  You're lucky I'm here.  I do really despise that.  What?  I do really despise that.  What?  When you have to fucking make chit chat.  Well, it's not even that.  Or else it's insulting someone.  But to be called out that you're not socializing as you're waiting on line because the Harry  Potter movies were so huge, you had to kind of wait so you got a good seat, I guess.  I'm sitting there like, it's bad enough I'm going to see a Harry Potter movie.  Although in the end, I kind of like the Harry Potter movies.  It's, you know, I did.  They got darker and darker as they went on, too. 
[00:15:30]  They added black people?  Yeah, a lot of black students and stuff.  I didn't know it got darker.  I was going to ask about that.  Yeah, they didn't work as hard, though, and they all fell because they're black.  I get it, Anthony.  They were in the shitty school because no one gives a shit about black people.  The bad part of Hogwarts.  Yeah, Hogwarts.  The part where you can't go in the stairwell or you get raped.  That's right.  Yeah.  They were on the other side of town. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  On the other side of the tracks.  No one gave a shit about them.  Because they're black.  Then a white wizard came in to teach them and taught them how to really learn.  And he was grand.  Yeah.  Oh, grand wizard, yes.  When the white teacher went into the black high school, I was always the guy thinking,  all right, what did he do wrong?  What kid did he touch that they sent him to the black school?  Yeah, because he had no one volunteered for that.  A white teacher would volunteer to go to the black school, so that means they did something 
[00:16:30]  really shitty in the white school.  They touched the pee-pee.  I think they touched someone's wee-wee and had to go and get beat up.  And those were the days when they didn't fire anyone.  They just fucking moved you around a little bit, like the Catholic Church.  Put them to the black school.  Just move people around a little bit.  No one will notice.  Oh, they'll notice when that community starts complaining.  Michelle Pfeiffer went down on some girl in gym class and ended up at the black school.  Is that what happened?  No. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  In a dangerous mind?  I'm just saying.  Why would the white teacher go to the black school?  Did they explain why she ended up there?  It's horse shit.  Dude, they haven't been explaining that since Blackboard Jungle when Glenn Ford, even though  it wasn't a black school, it really wasn't a black school.  The only one black was Poitier, actually.  I'm wrong.  Yeah, but there was another one where it wasn't Blackboard Jungle.  It was another school movie from the 50s.  Was that the one where they sang that?  Oh, To Serve With Love?  When Poitier was the teacher, it was in England.  I think To Serve With Love was one where they were tough thugs. 
[00:17:30]  That was it?  Yeah, but Poitier played a teacher.  No, there was Blackboard Jungle.  Who was Poitier as a student.  No, that was, what's his name?  He lost his head in a helicopter.  Glenn Ford.  Glenn Ford.  Vic Morrow.  Vic Morrow.  Jamie Farr, but he was Jameel Farah then.  But there's two different movies.  Yes, they are.  Decades apart.  Blackboard Jungle.  And To Serve With Love.  And To Serve With Love.  Sidney Poitier was the tough student in Blackboard Jungle.  He played Miller.  Oh.  And then To Serve With Love, he played the teacher in England.  It was in England.  Nice.  And Lulu was there.  Lulu was singing.  And she said that his balls had an ashy odor. 
[00:18:00]  I missed that part.  They must have edited that out in the TV version.  I don't remember To Serve With Love.  It couldn't be good, though.  It's horrid.  Is it bad?  Oh, yeah.  When she sings To Serve With Love, which was the big song.  It's a good song.  Is it?  You like that?  It's nostalgic.  I'll give you that.  To serve.  It's kind of like that it goes.  It's very nostalgic.  It makes you sad.  It depresses me.  Listen, Pirate Trucker's got to say something.  What?  What?  Pirate Trucker. 
[00:18:30]  This is a good one.  Can you go back to regular radio?  But we're making our own Jocktober bit.  Come on.  Oh, fuck.  Can you go back to Nose?  All right.  We've been on the air, what?  Half hour, technically.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  We've already talked about Genesis, who hasn't been relevant in 20 years, we just realized.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Harry fucking Potter.  But everybody knows him.  Fuck. 
[00:19:00]  Come on now, guys.  Rusty!  Yeah, what is this?  Douche-tober?  Lord, where's my Jocktober?  Right, Rusty.  Great name, by the way.  Yeah, you know, different things for different people.  That's fine.  Oh, different strokes for different folks, I like to say.  It's all right and wrong.  New character?  No.  It's just feeling good.  It's feeling good, Chip.  Sometimes up.  Who's Chip?  Yeah, it's up, Chip.  Who's Chip?  So you might know my friend's potato or poker. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, Chips.  Hey.  What was your favorite TV show from the 70s?  It's probably Happy Days.  No, what about there was another one?  I would always thumbs up.  No, no, no.  I would say, I'm going in a room with my friends, Chip, and I'd go, hey.  The one with the cops.  Do you remember that one?  I would stand in the bushes and watch her as they would help her do push-ups.  I would just like, hey.  Remember Ponch and John?  You remember those two?  What?  No.  It probably was your favorite show ever. 
[00:20:00]  I liked Happy Days.  It was California Highway Patrol.  Every time I hit the jukebox, nothing would happen.  But you should have liked another show that was Two Guys, California Highway Patrol.  I like Buzz and Buddies.  No, no.  No, you're incorrigible, Chip.  Hey.  Well, my mother was in the room with her friends.  He's not going to say it, Anthony.  Of course he's not.  I'll say it.  Believe me, I know it.  I like this show.  Yeah, which show?  On Poncherello.  Chippers.  It wasn't Chippers. 
[00:20:30]  It was just Chips.  Ryan.  Kansas City.  Ryan.  The Love Boat.  Guys, your show is great.  I love it.  I love it.  Of course you do.  We should hang up right now.  Before it gets bad.  Yeah.  It's the fucking worst.  It's the fucking worst.  You spend all your day talking to people you don't want to talk to, working, and then  you go out with your girlfriend's friends, and she's fucking bitching at you socialize  with them.  It is not bad enough that you're out with them.  Give me a fucking break. 
[00:21:00]  Now you've got to chit-chat.  Really?  My presence is enough.  Thank you.  Wow.  There's a self-important guy.  I like this guy.  No, it's...  Just me being there is enough.  Just gaze upon me.  I like bringing up stuff that people can relate to.  A lot of us have to sit there and, oh, well, why don't you just continue?  Go ahead.  Just talk.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Ryan.  I'm sorry.  Whenever you hear Opie's voice, just talk over it.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  My bad, dude.  My bad.  It certainly is. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  No doubt.  And then he takes up where he left off.  He's not going to say, all right, Opie, you go.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  He's like, well, I was saying.  Why don't you let Opie finish his thought, then you finish his thought.  I feel like it now.  No, but I want to hear it.  Oh, no.  Don't rob us because of his selfishness.  Why should...  No, I don't want to.  Why should we be robbed of such a gift?  I don't want to.  I can't.  I feel like I fit right fucking in, right?  Talking over each other.  Anyway, I'm just...  I don't want to talk to anyone else at all.  Talk to what you do.  Dude, you broke up.  What?  What I'm saying is, basically, you know, you spend all fucking weeks talking to people you 
[00:22:00]  don't want to talk to.  And then you fucking got to go out and talk to others.  Like Ryan from Kansas City?  Exactly.  I'm out.  I'm flaming, boys.  I'm flaming.  All right, Ryan.  Thank you.  Your tail's on fire.  Yeah, when you're forced to socialize, that never works.  Well, I don't like the whole...  That's the past, though.  Yeah.  You're done with that shit?  Oh, fucking for years.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Many years now, thank God.  I told you that I would get rid of those. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Those people in my life.  And then 10 years later, I did.  There's got to be a few people that you look at and go, I got it.  No, I mean, if it happens naturally, yeah.  I mean, all of a sudden, if you're in a social situation and all of a sudden you realize someone  there is cool and can have an actual conversation about real stuff, yeah, that's awesome.  But I'm not going to sit there and just chit-chat and small talk.  Do you just walk away?  I make them walk away.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just pull your cock out?  Do you pull a brain? 
[00:23:00]  No, they just...  Do you pull a brain out of your zipper?  I think they just get uncomfortable and then move on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A fruit bowl?  I fucking love the uncomfortableness.  Give them a fruit bowl.  Yeah.  Hey, shit.  But you could small talk.  I've seen you in action.  Yeah, I'll small talk.  You can hold court.  I don't mind.  I don't like holding court.  Eh.  I'm not a holding court type of guy.  I like parties and hanging out and talking with people and shit like that.  You're the king of all that.  I don't mind that.  All right.  Why don't we do some radio?  That was just our warm-up. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was small talk.  Apple stock is going to take a hit today.  Why?  What happened?  What did they do wrong this time?  One of the victims, he was a Unabomber victim.  He invented something, like the patents that involved the technology, the cover flow, when  you look at album covers and stuff, and Spotlight, which you can search your whole Mac with.  Uh-huh.  He just won $625 million.  Wait, and what did he do?  He invented this stuff, and they said that Apple infringed on his patent. 
[00:24:00]  And he won.  Is it, uh...  Is he a victim that's alive, or is he paying out his family?  He was one of the guys targeted by the Unabomber.  Okay.  I guess the technology that stays a brilliant guy.  That's a coincidence.  Brilliant guy, and now Apple owes him $625 million.  I would say the Unabomber maybe was in cahoots with Apple trying to get rid of him.  Just speculating.  I think...  Steve Jobs might have hired this gentleman.  Yeah.  I'm just saying this.  I think Apple laughs at that figure.  That's what I said.  $625 million. 
[00:24:30]  That's a lot.  That's almost a billion.  That's a half a billion.  They'll appeal the fuck out of that.  They'll ruin this guy before they pay him.  They infringed on all three patents held by Mirror Worlds.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yep.  And they got awarded $208 million for each patent they got.  Ah, they'll appeal it.  Nothing's gonna happen.  Oh, he's blinded in one eye, lost most of his right hand, and suffered other stuff.  Is he our intern?  No.  Sounds like a description of our intern.  You know what?  Apple's up.  You see fucking Netflix? 
[00:25:00]  You see Google?  Yesterday was a sick fucking market day.  She's serious.  Double digit shit.  Serious, too.  That's because we re-signed.  That's because we re-signed.  I know it.  It's because of the shitty deal we got, and the stock went up.  We re-signed.  The stock has been up like fucking, I don't know, 20% since we re-signed.  So why don't they give us some of the profits of us re-signing?  Can I say it's as high as it's ever been since I bought it?  Yeah, 52-week high and longer.  We were in the trade peeps yesterday about all that. 
[00:25:30]  Huge.  O&A sign, and the stock is at a 52-week high.  That's huge.  Of course.  I pulled out of Apple, of course, to buy British Petroleum.  That's up, too.  Which, of course, is up, but it's just hovering there.  Go up!  It's oil, for fuck's sake!  I don't know how stock people know, but my guy said when I bought it, he goes,  I think it's a 41, 42 all stock.  This is about a few months ago.  It's retire!  I hope he's wrong, too, but I don't know how these guys know this shit.  They study this stuff.  You could say to me, will this be a nickel or 400,000 a share? 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  No clue.  I don't know.  They study the charts.  There's all sorts of charts.  I'm ready to bail out of BP and find something else.  My brother was a Wall Street guy.  He got yanked out with everybody else, and now he's day trading his ass off and fucking,  he's just fine, because he knows that shit.  I don't know why he's not giving me a few fucking pointers.  If you day trade, though, you've got to sit there and play every tick.  You can't just do it like...  That's his full-time job. 
[00:26:30]  That's what I mean.  Yeah, exactly.  No joke.  But he can't give you a tip on something that he's playing every fucking two minutes.  Oh, no.  He's trading a tick.  My brother day trades all day long.  Yeah, yeah.  All legal.  It's hard.  It's a whole job.  All on the up and up.  Like Gallagher does.  That's what Gallagher does.  He doesn't do it right.  Anthony's correct.  My brother wakes up like it's his job now, gets ready, gets his coffee, gets an hour or  two before the market even opens, studies shit.  You got three monitors. 
[00:27:00]  And then he's looking at computer screens for the next seven hours or whatever.  You're surrounded by three monitors and you're trading ticks on fucking ten stocks at a clip  at least.  Goes down a quarter.  Boom.  Buy.  Up fucking quarter.  Boom.  Sell.  You're buying and selling on little ticks and all day long.  I'll tell you what's going on with Wall Street too because he got yanked out when companies  were going under and merging and all that.  And he actually survived for a while.  And then they finally got him with a lot of other people.  Good people too, by the way.  And now Wall Street wants him back and he's like, it's not the same world anymore. 
[00:27:30]  He said, I could go back for maybe a third of what I was making.  Nope.  And he wasn't one of the high, high guys that have mansions on the fucking ocean in the  Hamptons and all that.  But he was making a good living for him and his three kids.  And he's like, I'm not going back for a third of the salary to do the exact same work.  By the way, that is what Gallagher does.  Remember when we were at K-Rock and we had him in?  He sat in that room for hours.  He tried to explain it.  He's a genius.  He reads everything. 
[00:28:00]  He reads all these things and spends hours.  But you can't sit at someone else's computer, though.  No, he's not a laptop.  I know.  But you need three computers.  It seems exhausting.  It is.  Hell!  Bye.  What's that?  Fuck.  But you put in orders.  I don't know what any of that shit is.  You put in the orders, though, and automate them.  So it'll knock you out of a stock at a certain price.  And then you set up another one.  And you're setting up, like, all these trades on autopilot. 
[00:28:30]  And you just keep going all fucking day long.  It's angering and exhausting.  I really do want to go see Wall Street Money Never Sleeps.  Yeah, yeah.  The second one.  Because the first one was so good.  I heard it's good.  Yeah, I heard it's great.  Did you see what Michael Douglas looks like?  Now he doesn't look as good, right?  What would TylerDurtonDo.com have the picture yesterday?  Oh, no.  Really?  Can we see that, Dan?  I haven't seen it.  His treatment is either beating the shit out of him or he's going to be gone.  That's not him.  Or he's going to be gone sooner than later, man. 
[00:29:00]  He looks like Kirk Douglas.  Go to www.tdd.com.  Our boys over there are great.  That's stage four throat cancer.  Michael Douglas doesn't look so good.  That's what he looked like.  Did he smoke?  Two days ago.  You've got to think he was like a cigar guy.  He seems like he was a cigar guy.  Anytime you hear someone has throat cancer, you're like, please say he smokes.  You really do.  That's the first question you ask about cancer.  Does he smoke?  Right.  I hate when people have lung cancer and it's like, never touched a cigarette, was never  around people that smoked, but never drank. 
[00:29:30]  It's like, well, I hate hearing that.  How old is he?  He's no kid.  He doesn't look that great in these pictures on whatwithtylerderndu.com, but I'm thinking  we're just looking at a picture of a guy.  How old is a motherfucker?  Isn't made up, right?  Exactly, Jimmy.  He got up to walk his daughter to school or something, so you know he didn't shower.  He doesn't have the Hollywood makeup and all that shit on.  No hair dye.  He looks all right in the new movie.  That's probably what he really looks like.  He looks all right in the new movie.  Yeah, but they fucking cleaned him up nice. 
[00:30:00]  Of course.  I was right.  But if he's just walking...  66 years young.  66 years young.  Michael Douglas is 66.  Remember Streets of San Francisco?  He was the young fucking cop full of piss and vinegar.  Star chamber.  That was great.  Let's be real.  Oh, come on.  You don't want to go back that far?  Star chamber.  Streets of San Francisco.  Call Malden.  Star chamber.  Yeah, that was a great movie.  Who's that chick he's with?  Wow, he really goes for the young ones.  That's his daughter.  Oh, it's his daughter?  Oh, sorry.  That's his daughter.  I think he probably looks pretty good, and that's just how he looks when he wakes up in the morning. 
[00:30:30]  Why does a 66-year-old guy have a daughter that young, by the way?  Because he's a hot young wife.  He's with Zeta.  Zeta Jones.  Oh, okay.  Fucking Michael Douglas, man.  Huh?  Stage four is a...  My buddy Ray, who...  Garvey was a...  Oh!  You!  You could have called him Ray.  Not anymore.  Oh, my God.  But no, he had stage four.  Stomach cancer.  It's like when you're diagnosed with stage four, it's rough, man.  I had stage eight.  I can't cure...  They cured it with something. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I know.  I was trying to tell you that.  Stealing my thunder.  I was just...  I actually just wanted you to do that.  I know you did.  You never know what could happen.  It could be good.  You had stage four.  Stomach cancer.  That's a motherfucker, man.  I want to go for a physical, which, like, checks all your blood and stuff.  Why would you do that?  Why would you want to know?  The second you go for a physical or something, you're done for.  You're done for.  You're a man.  Men don't do that.  They'll find one little thing that means nothing,  and they'll try to treat it, and it'll turn into, like, shit. 
[00:31:30]  I have to know, though.  What's the difference between the two pictures there, Danny?  How many years?  Two hours.  Two hours!  We're looking at a relatively younger-looking Michael Douglas.  Yeah, but the one on the right, he's got some hair product in.  He grew his hair out a little longer.  He's got a tan going on.  He's smiling.  He's got a tan.  And he's also at some events, so you know he's got some makeup on.  He doesn't look as droopy.  What's the year difference?  They don't say?  No, they don't say.  I mean, I would assume that it's probably about 15 years ago.  No, no, no.  15?  No.  Yeah.  Danny, they do say. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  They do say.  They do?  Go back.  You clicked on a link, right?  Right before the link, they say that this is a picture of him.  I'm in the photo set.  Because I studied this whole thing yesterday.  Go.  Unless they changed the website today.  I hope not.  This is what he looked like one year earlier.  Not a year.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  No fucking way.  That's a year?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Is that a bitch?  He's so dead in three months.  So he had a rough year.  I give him three months.  That's bullshit, though.  I don't know about that, though, man. 
[00:32:30]  Radiation will fucking dry you out.  Dude, I give him three months.  He just looks dried out.  He just needs a little more moisture put in his mouth.  He has no makeup on here.  His hair is not done.  There's no way the guy on the right is ever looking like the guy on the left and vicey-versy.  Vicey-versy.  It doesn't happen.  That guy is dead.  If you want to see the picture, go to whatwithtylerdurtondo.com.  He looks like fucking Michael Douglas in the one picture. 
[00:33:00]  And that was him five months ago.  Five months ago.  He looks like Kirk, man.  And look at his neck where that cancer is just camping out.  Radiation is a motherfucker.  I had to.  I mean, I wanted to.  Radiation.  Brother Louise had his cancer.  I was going over the east side every day watching what that did to him.  Radiation's a motherfucker.  Can they come up with a better thing than radiation?  Brother Louise's radiation was basically right between the eyes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  How long does it take to go in the head?  Like, were they just aiming at you?  How does it work?  I don't know.  He showed me his leather mask he had to wear.  Aaron, it just burned the shit out of everything.  It was, like, deep in the nasal.  Didn't they put tattooed dots on his face so they could line it up perfectly every time?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, so they could line it up perfect every time with, like, the pins and shit?  He had, like, a temporary tattoo or something, so they knew exactly what he was doing.  How did they find it in there?  What made him look in the sinuses?  I don't remember anymore.  Oh, he blew his nose and a big tumor came out. 
[00:34:00]  He's a Vietnam guy.  Agent Orange.  All they're saying is a bunch of the Vietnam guys get this particular cancer, so whether  it's Agent Orange or whatever.  In sinuses, if they're snorting in that defoliant.  Yeah, who knows?  But to watch what that did at him, holy shit.  Drives you out.  Drives out everything.  Burns everything.  V.C. blood.  V.C. blood gives you cancer.  Yeah.  I was going to use the G word, but I figured I'd better off being nice.  Yeah.  You can't say that one.  You know what I mean? 
[00:34:30]  Can you say that one still?  The C word.  What's that?  Not the girl C word, the Asian C word.  Could have used that.  The chinky word?  Yeah, yeah.  You can't say the chinky word anymore.  I could have used the D word, which is also a good one for back then.  Or Charlie.  Why can you say Charlie?  Why was Charlie so offensive?  Uh, Charlie was actually, um, for V.C.  It was Victor Charlie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, for V.C. 
[00:35:00]  And then they shortened it to just Charlie.  Oh, I thought the leader's name was Charlie or something.  Ah, could have been too.  Charlie's son.  I know what you're doing here, and I don't appreciate it.  What am I doing?  You decided you're going to do small talk for the first hour.  You know what?  Just to fucking bother me.  I love small talk.  You're bothering me now.  You're fucking bothering me.  All we're doing is small talking.  I love it.  There's no big punchlines here.  There's no wow moments.  We're just fucking chit-chatting.  Just hashing things out. 
[00:35:30]  Bunch of guys.  Jocktober.  I'll tell you this much.  This Randy Moss doesn't want to play for the Patriots anymore.  Where's he going?  We'll give you some news.  Where's he going?  He wants to go back to the Vikings.  Vikings?  He wants to team up with Brett Favar.  With Brett Favar-y.  Yeah, they're mulling it over whether or not they're going to trade Randy Moss.  Is he having a good year or no?  Honestly, I don't know.  I know he had that amazing one-handed catch.  Are they doing well, or are the Vikings doing well?  What's the record? 
[00:36:00]  The Pats are 3-1, the Jets are 3-1, the Vikings are...  The Vikings are 1-2.  They had a bye last week.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So, why does Randy Moss want out of New England?  Anyone know?  I think he said something like a couple weeks ago that he just doesn't think New England  wants him there.  He's just so difficult to...  Is he just a weirdo?  Yeah.  He really is.  What's his problem?  But he's got...  I mean, he's got three touchdowns this year.  That's not bad for four games, you know?  I'm sure he's having an okay year.  Yeah, he's not terrible.  Well, the fucking Jets are going to destroy the Vikings Monday night football. 
[00:36:30]  Can't wait.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I fucking...  I know Jets this year.  You sure do?  You're bleeding Jet Green.  I've just been one of those diehard Jet fans for so many years.  It's so nice to see them right there, you know, in first place.  Actually, tied, but they're right in there.  First place.  Yeah.  I'm feeling good about the Jets this year.  And after so many years of, you know...  Tell me about it.  Oh, you don't have to tell me.  I've been following him for... 
[00:37:00]  Jeez, please.  Minutes.  And in other news, I couldn't be happier.  And the NBA started a little preseason action.  Yes.  And, you know, you got LeBron James down there in Miami.  Of course.  With that super team.  Preseason game, Dwayne Wade goes down with a hamstring injury.  He's going to be out a few weeks.  I couldn't be happier.  How'd that happen?  Just, uh...  I told you it would happen.  What?  Well, LeBron went to fucking Miami. 
[00:37:30]  I said something awful's going to happen.  Oh, right, right.  You know, because the basketball guys aren't going to allow, you know, Miami just to...  That super team.  Just to, you know, start a super team and win the title.  He didn't warm up?  Did he pull a hammy?  He pulled a hammy.  He's got to warm up like in Cable Guy.  He pulled a hammy, right.  Yeah, of course you've got to warm up like in Cable Guy.  You've got to warm up.  Don't want to pull a hammy.  Oh, the contract is expiring.  Thank you, Andrew.  Ours?  Already?  Oh, God.  I can only wish. 
[00:38:00]  Thanks, Danny.  Danny pulled up.  Cable Guy.  Now, this movie should have been good.  By far the best Jim Carrey movie.  I watch it now and think it's funnier than I ever thought it was when I watched it when  it first came out.  Incredibly underrated.  It's hysterical.  Yeah.  It's fucking hysterical.  I forgot about the warm up scene.  The warm up.  Do you want to put a hammy?  It was just on the other day and I had to just sit there and watch it.  Anytime it's on, I'll just sit there.  What is it, like 95, 96? 
[00:38:30]  He was about 96, I think.  Yeah.  Cable Guy is a dark, twisted car.  Yeah.  And he totally calls the internet.  Oh, yeah.  I'll do it.  I'm going to watch this movie again.  He describes the internet, what it's going to turn into, and it's exactly what it turned  into.  And what did he say?  I don't remember.  Like that you'll be playing fucking...  Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam.  With a friend in Vietnam.  You'll be watching like 300 channels.  Like he's got all this fucking shit that wound up happening. 
[00:39:00]  And it's just funny as fuck, man.  He's really good.  Hey, if we're going to continue chit-chatting, let me tell you something.  A little small talk?  Wait, you got a little small talk, huh?  Today's a big day.  The Fios presentation goes down in my building today.  Are you going to the Fios presentation?  Jimmy, I'm going to invite you to the Fios demonstration today.  When?  What time?  Sometime today in my building in the lobby.  You've got to tape it.  I can't wait.  I want to hear the guy come in and go, this is great.  Not only... 
[00:39:30]  Time-warned people are offering blowjobs in the other room to keep you out of the Fios thing.  Not only...  I'm so good for the blowjob.  Not only am I getting rid of Time Warner Cable, when I drop off all my equipment, I'm going  to kick someone in the cunt.  Kick them hard.  Really hard.  Right in the cunt.  Really hard.  So you bring back all your DVRs and...  Exactly.  Right in the cunt.  Right there in the cunt.  Dude, do I want Fios?  Oh, everyone does.  You picked the wrong building to live in, my friend.  But why? 
[00:40:00]  Yours is before mine, so mine will be after, I said.  Nope.  I was getting some din-din last night at the Chinese restaurant.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  And they had Cablevision on.  And News 12 was on.  And I'm watching.  And by the way, they've decided to just get the hottest fucking blonde girl on News 12  now.  To try to combat all they could do, because they say, well, we have News 12 and it's not  available on Fios or satellite or anything.  Okay.  The hottest blonde News 12 girl I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:40:30]  But News 12 is the breathing ground for the hot blonde chick.  Yeah.  A lot of News 12 girls moved on to big things.  They got Laura Spencer from The Insider started at News 12 on Long Island.  Do you remember that one?  She should go to Swank.  Really?  Right from News 12 to Swank.  Swank is Swank.  But I want to see her at Swank.  She has an awful name, though.  Does she?  What is it?  Betsy Turd Shoes.  It's not Betsy Turd Shoes.  Betsy Turd Shoes?  She went on to CBS News.  I would watch the news every night if Betsy Turd Shoes was doing it. 
[00:41:00]  And the story being covered right now, let's go to Betsy Turd Shoes.  Who's her on-air partner?  Because they team them up with a guy.  So if you've got Betsy Turd Shoes.  Kyle Milk.  Ew.  What a dumb name.  Kyle Milk and Betsy Turd Shoes here.  News 12 kept putting on the bottom, on the graphic, News 12, Long Island.  Not available on satellite.  Not available on Fios.  Gives a shit. 
[00:41:30]  It's not Jody Applegate.  I was just like, who cares?  No, it's not Jody Applegate.  Jody Applegate's been around a while.  Just fine.  She's getting long in the tooth.  I know the name.  I just figured maybe it was someone else's name.  The second you see her, you'll know who she is.  Jody Applegate, her career is going backwards.  She was doing some network stuff, and now she's back at News 12.  Blonde and hot as fuck.  Let me see if anybody knows the name.  Anyone knows here on Pally?  I'll look over here on Pally.  No one knows.  I saw her last night.  It's Judy Martin, obviously. 
[00:42:00]  No, it's not ugly Judy Martin.  No, it's not Judy Martin.  No, she's terrible.  It's not Shea Ryan.  No.  Shea Ryan is almost hot.  We discussed that the other day.  No, this chick is some blonde.  She was on there, and I was waiting for my Chinese food, and two guys were sitting at  the bar, and when she came on...  It's Carol Silva, obviously.  Oh, it's Carol Silva.  Yeah.  Ick!  Both guys at the bar just went like, oh man, where the hell did she come from? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I...  Like, too hot.  Really?  No, it's not.  She's a hard...  Her name is hard to say.  Is it?  What is it?  Um, it's hard.  It's...  I can't...  I can...  I know what I...  It's like...  It's Gladys...  That is very hard to say.  Yes, there's a G and an N.  I don't care.  A bunch of R's.  I'm going to Google Images, Danny, and just putting in hot news 12 girl, and I'll put that 
[00:43:00]  in.  Uh, why am I just getting, um, young boys and pornography?  Jesus.  Huh?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Uh, no one knows who this broad is.  Who is she?  She's fucking blonde.  She looks great.  Man, nothing's coming up, man.  Faggots.  You're all faggots.  Yeah.  Did you just cyber bully?  Don't cyber bully, man.  I don't cyber bully.  That's a hot topic right now.  I don't cyber bully.  If you're a celebrity and you want to be noticed, you talk about cyber bullying, and 
[00:43:30]  man, they will run your podcast.  You know something?  I am...  People were talking about cyber bullying all day yesterday.  I'm actually speaking about cyber bullying.  Were you bullied as a kid?  Uh, I was cyber bullied, yeah, before, even though it was just some guy with a walkie-talkie.  I would turn on my walkie-talkie, and he'd call me a little faggot, and I would cry and  run home.  That was the only cyber bullying we had.  And he'd smack me in my penis with the antenna.  Cyber bullying is no joke. 
[00:44:00]  That's a real fucking topic out there now.  Oh, it certainly is.  It's, uh, taking over the world.  Well, you know, you got the guy, the gay guy, and he jumped off the bridge.  Now, obviously, uh, tragic.  But let me tell you something.  I think he had a few more problems than just that, actually, what they call the straw that  broke the camel's back.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't think one instance is going to make you go, well, I'm going to jump off this  fucking bridge.  I think, uh, he had a lot of problems with his sexual identity. 
[00:44:30]  His parents didn't know, his family didn't know he was gay.  And then these guys pretty much outed him on camera.  They just thought it was going to be some goofy thing.  Did they know he was gay?  Like, they just, they put a Skype, they put a, uh, computer in his room, the, uh, his  roommate, they, he had Skype running, put it on Skype, and then put it out to everybody  and was tweeting, like, holy shit, check this out, there's, like, sex going on in the  room.  I bet he knew he was gay or suspected.  From the stories that I had read, uh, I guess the guy, the kid Tyler, who ended up committing 
[00:45:00]  suicide, who was the gay guy, he asked his roommate if he could have the room to himself.  Yes, yes.  Well, roommates will do that in college.  Yeah, and then, uh, I guess the other roommate wanted to see what was going on, why he wanted  the room, so he decided to, to remotely access the webcam on his computer.  Now, did he think another guy was going to be in there, or it was going to be him and  a chick?  I think he just wanted to see what was going on.  Because that'd be fucked up.  Imagine, like, your roomie or your friend is going into a room, you hook up a camera  and go, holy shit, he's in there with a guy.  It's just a dumb college prank that went wrong. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're talking about, like, hate crime, oppressing charges.  It's just a dumb fucking thing that they did.  You can't press manslaughter charges.  No, no, no.  It's silly.  You know, you're not driven to suicide by that.  Like you said, that's the final thing.  You gotta go way back.  Like, you know, the family's attitude or whatever the fuck it was.  Yeah, there had to be other shit, and that was just the breaking point.  Like, oh, fuck, now everyone knows.  Well, here's our gay expert, Sam.  Not only a gay expert, he's also an expert at being bullied. 
[00:46:00]  He's actually the guy who's making out with him.  Yes, were you?  Why didn't you jump, too?  I wasn't making out with anyone.  You weren't?  At that time.  Where are you at with cyberbullying?  Were you bullied as a kid there, Sam?  No, I did a lot of bullying.  Oh, you did.  No, you did.  I was a tormentor.  A little psychological.  That's crazy.  What about online?  Did you cyberbully?  I love cyberbullying.  It sounds so fucking tough.  No, cyberbullying was just after my time.  I would have been a cyberbullier, I'm sure.  You're that old?  I'm 27. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  I'm real bullying.  We had a guy named Patrick Fullan.  Patrick Fullan.  And he was a big fat kid.  And we used to punch him in the stomach just to see him make that face.  That's crazy.  I've told that before, but it's like we'd walk up to him in between, and everyone did it.  And we'd punch him in the stomach, and he made this weird like he was going to throw up face,  and he'd kind of hunch over, and we'd all laugh because he made the face.  That's crazy.  And everyone punched him in the stomach. 
[00:47:00]  And then there was Bellin-Gornell.  Yeah.  Bellin-Gornell smelled really bad.  And we used to tell her she stunk, and we'd point in her face like right up to her nose  and go, you stink, you stink, you stink, until she cried.  What was the rest of the rhyme?  Just you stink.  It didn't have to rhyme.  She stunk.  What hacks?  I know.  It was really hacky.  You can't rhyme stink with anything?  We weren't trying.  There was a girl in third grade named Berenice who had big eyes, and she was large.  So first we just started following her around calling Big-Eyed Berenice, and then we started 
[00:47:30]  calling her Bear-a-Beast.  Bear-a-Beast.  It's horrible.  That was before cyberbullying, where it was just bullying.  You had to do it for real.  But the reason the kid's in trouble at Rutgers is because he Twittered, hey, my roommate's  making out with a guy.  Tap into my iChat name, and you can watch, too.  And what's wrong with that?  That's dirty, though.  Wait, what?  It's really bad.  Do you want to see the video? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  But I mean in the same way I watch beheading videos.  If you were jerking off, you wouldn't want people to see it or fool around and check it.  I bet you that's not the first time a college kid did that, though.  You're probably right.  That's him right there?  I bet you that type of thing's been going on for a while.  He looks very well-kempt.  Oh, yes.  I'll give him that.  But I think they said they can't charge the kid with a hate crime because there's no evidence  that he wouldn't have done that if his roommate was making out with a girl.  They were saying it's very difficult also to prove that a suicide was someone enticed him 
[00:48:30]  into committing suicide and is then responsible for his death.  He took his own life, so he can't charge anybody with a manslaughter.  More importantly, you've got every celebrity in the world now talking about cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying.  There you are.  I've got a disc.  Let me go burn it.  What do you got?  Who's been talking about cyberbullying?  Everybody.  Well, they're not just talking about...  Who's really into...  Can we break this down, though?  What happens is...  George Clooney.  When you get a hot topic like this, all of a sudden the celebrities come on board.  They don't even believe in the cause, but they're like, holy shit. 
[00:49:00]  I could get my name out there.  All I have to do is make believe I got some concern for a hot topic.  What color ribbon should this be?  This...  Cyberbullying, do you think?  Brown for turds.  What's taken up?  I think brown is already for colon cancer.  Well, because...  Why would you pick brown for colon cancer?  Because it's shit.  It's the color of shit.  Can't you be a little more creative than that?  That's your answer, because the nipple is usually like a pinkish hue.  What's the gay thing?  It should be like a rainbow ribbon.  Gay is...  Gay AIDS is red.  That was the first one, because the infected AIDS blood. 
[00:49:30]  But the cyberbullying, the cause right now is...  I know.  It's babbling.  Are the A-listers doing this, or is this more of a C-lister thing?  Yeah, it's not A-listers yet, because it's very gay rights oriented.  So it's your Kathy Griffins.  Perez Hilton is really leading it.  How many Kathy Griffins are there?  It's your Cindy Loppers.  How many Cindy Loppers are there?  I'm not a fan when people say that.  You know, you got your Brett Favre's...  I'm not Paris Hilton.  Perez.  Perez Hilton's...  He's against...  He's speaking out against... 
[00:50:00]  Who, Perez?  You're right.  That is funny.  That's the funniest fucking thing I think I've ever heard.  Who?  Perez Hilton.  Perez Hilton.  Is speaking out against cyberbullying?  Because he doesn't draw a comment.  Your motherfucker is the biggest cyberbully out there.  Fuck you, you fucking cunt.  I hate him.  Wait, Perez Hilton is part of his call?  He's the big one.  He's a cyberbully.  That is insane.  He's a cyberbully.  Get the fuck out of here.  Someone jumped off a bridge because there was cum dripping out of a picture of someone's  ass on his site that he penciled in. 
[00:50:30]  Fuck that guy, man.  He's the biggest cyberbully.  God, I wish brain cancer on him.  I wish brain cancer on fucking Perez Hilton.  Let's play a game.  Let's play the Perez Hilton scroll down the page game.  Let's see how many stories it takes for Perez to draw cum on someone's face.  He's a cyberbully.  Wait, wait.  Can we play the other game, too?  Because he does the coke thing as well.  Whatever.  Whichever one you want to play.  Every star in Hollywood obviously does coke if you go to Perez Hilton's site.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One.  All right.  There's one.  There's a...  Oh, three.  Wow.  I would have lost this part.  All right.  Can you stop?  I'll tell you exactly what the fuck's going on. 
[00:51:00]  Because...  Oh, yeah.  He's not doing it because you can't be for cyberbullying.  No, that's not anything.  He...  He's not doing it.  This is...  This is...  He's drawing...  There it goes.  All right.  There it is.  Vince Neil and Mel Gibson with giant cum-dripping dicks drawn in their mouth.  Right.  That's cyberbullying.  Right.  Vince Neil's microphone is now a big fucking dripping cock.  Yeah.  Thanks to the guy who's against cyberbullying.  What a douchebag.  Like, the fact that anybody listens to anything... 
[00:51:30]  I never know what that little bitch has to say because he is a fucking blogger.  That little fucking bitch.  He is a bitch.  But why would anybody listen to him?  He's just a blogger.  He's a fucking nerd.  They always have him on TV.  He's talking like he fucking means anything.  Oh, he sucks.  He sucks.  He sucks.  Perez Hilton.  He's the biggest...  Die.  He's the biggest fucking guy as far as cyberbullying.  He's a corny blogger.  And then someone calls him out on his shit and he cries like a little bitch.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  I love when celebrities get punched him in the face.  And he called somebody a faggot and then lied about it.  He sucks, man.  I love when he got fucking cracked in the head.  I did, too.  Fucking loved it.  Look, man.  When you're doing some edgy shit, there's that consequence that someone's going to fucking  hit you.  Someone's going to hit you.  And then someone finally hit Perez Hilton and he couldn't take it.  Yep.  Couldn't take it.  He whined and cried.  Look at there.  There's Gwyneth Paltrow with cum dripping out of her fucking mouth.  But Perez is going to tell everyone not to cyberbully.  Don't cyberbully.  In other words, don't cyberbully gay people like Perez Hilton? 
[00:52:30]  Because he's gay.  By the way.  Enough of you.  Gay.  This is Perez Hilton.  A big gay following on top of it.  Of course he does.  A lot of gays go into his site, including young, impressionable, uh...  Yes.  And what's he doing?  Cyberbullying.  Right.  But not cyberbullying.  Gay people.  Shut up, you fucking agenda-driven cunt.  But what he does, and this is why he's such a...  Suck cock and get dicks in his ass?  Yeah.  Jimmy, is that what you were going to say?  I'm focusing on the negative.  Oh, right. 
[00:53:00]  This is why he's such a sickening guy, is because he's painting cum on guys' faces, which is  a form of mockery.  Yeah.  So basically, you're saying that for a guy to take cum on his face is, uh...  Oh, it's a mockery.  It's a bad thing.  It's almost like you're selling out your own people.  And I know he puts it on women too, but everybody knows that a man drawn with cum dripping out  of his mouth is much more of an insult than a woman shown with cum leaking out of it.  So it's like, you can play the semantics game.  Maybe he fantasizes about what it would be like to blow a load in the guy's face, and 
[00:53:30]  it's his cum dripping out of his mouth, and it excites Perez.  It excites him.  Ugh.  But anyway...  I hate him.  Is he blogging about it?  I'd love to read his fucking awful blog.  About cyberbullying?  Oh, he sucks.  Stop already.  He's awful.  That's unbelievable that he's taken out of his arm.  Yeah, who's he's got now?  She has gone.  Kesha's got some cum dripping out of her mouth.  And out of her pussy.  Did you see that?  Oh, it was? 
[00:54:00]  It was out of...  Okay, let me see.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  What is that?  What is that?  Her outfit.  Yeah, this is part of her...  Oh, I think this is part of her gym shorts.  I thought he was being creative and had the cum dripping out of her pussy too.  Who's in the Kesha's little hot camp?  Who's in there?  Who's in the camp?  Hands?  Show of hands?  Show of hands?  Yeah, you know me.  I like a little skank.  A little skank.  Doesn't hurt.  I saw bikini pictures.  I'm not excited about it.  Yeah?  No, no, no, no.  You saw the one piece.  Wait.  There's new ones?  No, she was wearing that horrible one piece where she had the flat ass on vacation. 
[00:54:30]  I'll have to look at the other ones.  Yeah, I don't like that one.  What is that?  What is that?  Dane Cook's webcam video, October 4th, 2010.  For gay youth.  Dane Cook makes a video for gay youth.  Can we listen to this?  How long is that?  A minute 44?  Why don't we listen to Dane Cook talking about gay youth?  A lot of young people are emailing me and asking me about this bullying situation.  Cock sucker!  Yes.  I love Dane. 
[00:55:00]  Listen to him laugh.  Horrific behavior.  Here's where I stand.  A bully is someone who is in a lot of pain.  People that bully do that because they feel powerless.  And they need to lash out and control somebody else because they feel out of control.  They're very powerful bullies.  Believe me.  They are scarred by something that's happened in their life.  They are seriously traumatized by something that they are hiding.  Could you pause this for a second?  It's so fascinating to hear Dr. Cook talking about this. 
[00:55:30]  The psychiatrist Dr. Dane Cook talking about the psychology of a bully.  Shut up!  They don't feel weak.  You know what bullies feel?  They can beat people up and they do it.  Yeah, they don't know any better.  That's what bullies do.  They're big.  They're dumb.  They're like big dogs that bite people.  A big dog that bites people don't think, I sure wish I was a chihuahua. 
[00:56:00]  No, it's a big animal that fucks with you because they can.  Don't get into the psychiatry of the whole thing.  And by the way, this gay kid at Rutgers was not a victim of cyberbullying.  He was a victim of an invasion in privacy.  It was a prank that went horribly wrong.  But that was an invasion of privacy thing.  That's not a bully situation.  That's a guy being fucking...  If he was 6'5 and making out with a guy like...  It was done by a video camera.  That would have happened anyway. 
[00:56:30]  How big was his dick?  I don't know.  I didn't ask.  I think he meant 6 1⁄2 inches.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's just now it's the cause.  You know, Dane means well, but it's like...  No, I got to hear the rest of Dane.  Dane does mean well.  What are you doing?  No, I want to hear because...  We can still laugh at it.  He doesn't have to fucking get on and say it.  It'd be funny if you slap Bob Kelly in this at the end.  Oh, my God.  Or started making out with him.  I don't see your...  Or had Bob sucking his dick like he did every night on tour.  I don't see your cyberbullying...  Oh, Bob, I'm kidding.  I love you.  Shut up.  Wow, you're...  Wow.  I love Bob Kelly. 
[00:57:00]  Stop it.  Everyone knows that.  Oh, I love Bobby.  Fuck him.  He's just a beautiful ass.  My pal.  He was so handsome.  I'll get more Dane.  Yeah, I'll get more Dane to others.  Yeah.  So, and if you feel insignificant when you're younger and you're being picked on, then you  don't know where to go.  You just feel alone.  It's the loneliest kind of feeling.  Then go to a Lady Gaga show.  Number one is the loneliest number.  I'm wondering...  Thank you.  ...who's going to come after me next.  That's where the lonely people go.  So my message actually goes out to the eyewitnesses to these things happening. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah?  You need to get involved, okay?  You need to stop someone.  You need to help someone.  That's good.  Tell someone.  Yeah, good stuff.  If you do that, you could be helping somebody to stay alive.  You could be preventing somebody from taking their own life because they feel like they  have no other options.  Really?  Get involved somehow.  Get involved.  Even if it's anonymous email, whatever you need to do, get involved to stop these situations 
[00:58:00]  from happening so we don't have to see another one of our youth being picked on because of  their sexuality or their religion or size or whatever it is.  We all deserve a chance to be heard, so make your voice heard.  I just hate this stuff.  I fucking hate this stuff.  The reality is with bullying, it's been happening forever.  Yes.  It's always happened.  And it sucks.  And it does...  You know what?  But unfortunately, bullies are not the only targets because I fucking hate them too.  Like when Kipland Kinkle or fucking Klebold and Harris, when they come back with a fucking 
[00:58:30]  rifle because they can't take these jock scumbags or whoever it is, you get what you get.  There's your consequence right there.  But I mean, unfortunately, too many innocent people get killed too.  Yeah.  Right.  And you know, people that are not bullies.  But that's the...  Well, let's wait and see what Lady Gaga has to say about this.  Finally.  She can bring everyone together.  The voice of reason is what I'm thinking, Lady Gaga.  I don't think she's...  What kind of dress will she wear when she makes her big statement about this?  Well, I'm thinking giant, just pork chops over her tits. 
[00:59:00]  Nope.  Right?  And then a filet mignon.  Nope.  Right over her cunt.  I'm thinking old school Apple computers.  She's going to have a dress made of old school Apple computers.  Walk out on that stage.  Maybe Tandy.  How about Tandy computers?  Cyberbullying is...  Oh, because the cyber thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She'll have some kind of theme.  She was spotted wearing a hairdress recently in New York City.  Yeah, that was terrific.  A hairdress.  She made a dress out of hair.  She looks like Cousin It.  That's great.  Cancer patients must love seeing that.  Locks of love. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, way to rub it in.  Yeah, really.  That hair could have fucking made about a hundred wigs.  But Lady Gaga needed a new fucking dress.  The meat dress is so over.  It's old.  It's old.  It's old.  It really is.  It's so.  It's 810.  Cyberbullying is a bad thing.  It shouldn't happen.  It shouldn't happen.  Because the world is round.  People bully other people on the computer and it's called cyberbullying. 
[01:00:00]  It shouldn't happen, people.  Perez.  And everyone just screams.  Because we're all.  Yes.  Perez did quote Lady Gaga.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right.  She sings about sloppy blowjobs.  Blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Shut it.  Perez quoted Lady Gaga in his message.  Of course he did.  Well, Anthony, this is what we got.  Listen.  Oh, thank God.  We're going to start doing a radio show.  Enough with the chit-chat. 
[01:00:30]  Do you have Perez Hilton audio?  We got Perez.  Listen to this.  Because I really do hate when this happens.  I know the celebrities are trying to do the right thing.  But all of a sudden.  No, they're not.  They're trying to fucking.  No.  They're trying to jump on a wave.  Thank you.  They're trying to get exposure for themselves.  And we want to point that part of this out.  So we got some Glee star.  If you watch that shitty show.  I love Glee.  You're Gleek?  Let me tell you something.  You watch Glee?  This week, one of the guys on Glee, he toasts something and sees Jesus in his toast. 
[01:01:00]  And then they all sing, What If God Was One of Us.  Exactly.  And I just saw the commercial for it.  Oh.  And I fucking almost put two .40 caliber rounds into my television.  You didn't even see the Britney episode?  I swear to fuck, I almost shot my TV in my house.  Is that why Cheezus was trending yesterday?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you for explaining that.  Because Glee had the cheese fucking.  Here are the celebrities we're going to hear from about cyberbullying. 
[01:01:30]  And Sam's right.  These are B to C list.  Yes.  Grill Cheezus line was funny.  You're getting bounced.  I'm bouncing someone for that.  Oh, he's a Glee.  Nope.  Don't care.  Bounced.  Listen, we got a Glee person.  We got Wendy Williams speaking out on cyberbullying.  We got Lance Bass talking about it.  Project Runway's Tim Gunn.  Make it work.  Cindy Lauper.  You stink.  Ellen DeGeneres.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  She's broken up about it.  Is she?  Kathy Griffin.  She can't eat them up for a week.  And Perez Hilton.  You know what?  Look at the time lengths on them so you can see who really wants to talk about it the most.  Who do you think wants to talk about it the most out of all the people I just said?  Perez Hilton.  Of course.  I think because he's the most.  Ellen DeGeneres doesn't bother me because Ellen DeGeneres stood up and came out on her  sitcom, which was a big fucking thing, man.  Did she?  Yeah, man.  She's at least put her money where her fucking, with her work.  I just put her out there.  Where cocks don't go?  She put the pussy where her mouth is. 
[01:02:30]  But at least she fucking did it through her work, too.  You know what I mean?  She fucking, you know, in her show.  Yeah, yeah.  While she had the show.  But was anyone really surprised?  Oh, God, no.  I looked at Ellen Headshots recently down at Good Night, and there's an Ellen Headshot  from way in the 80s.  There's a clit on her mouth.  It's like, wow, that's a dead giveaway.  She looks like fucking Jeff Conaway.  You know what I mean?  She's like a mullet in a suit.  Jeff Conaway.  I certainly was shocked.  I couldn't believe that.  Were you?  Yeah.  That was shocking.  Oh, Gregorio.  I can't believe it. 
[01:03:00]  Celeb bullying.  Jim Norton versus Jesse Ventura.  There you go.  Jesse Ventura was fucking cyberbullying you that day.  Thanks for your service.  Thanks for your service to your country.  And we cyberbullied him by putting the video out to TMZ and making him look silly.  But I didn't feel bullied at all.  I just felt like I had an argument.  I was an asshole.  I was saying you bullied him.  Oh.  And Ellen DeGeneres did a whole show on cyberbullying yesterday.  Larry King did, too.  Of course it is.  What?  But he just had people. 
[01:03:30]  He was talking.  He wasn't that good.  He had the bullies on.  I don't understand what cyber even means.  What's bullying?  He was trying to get the bullies to fucking meet up with their victims so they could actually  punch them instead of only doing it online.  How about you turn the fucking computer off?  And he just has, like, old school references.  Is that like Butch and Wame from our gang?  How they bully Spanky and Alfalfa?  Butch was a cyberbully, wasn't he?  No, they only had a donkey. 
[01:04:00]  And they had a cat that chased a mouse to make the conveyor belt run.  There's no Facebook on that?  No, there isn't.  But they did.  The car ran because a dog was on a conveyor chasing a cat.  Why don't we take a break?  What?  We got all the cyberbullying audio.  I cannot wait.  Of course, we got Jacktober.  We're going to Pittsburgh today, I see. 
[01:04:30]  That's right.  We're going to Pittsburgh for Jacktober.  We got Ozzy doing a John Lennon song.  For his 70th birthday.  For John Lennon's 70th birthday.  An obscure song, though.  How?  I don't know that song.  I've not heard it either.  Really?  I'll talk to Jack tomorrow when I see him about it.  Jack Osborne.  Nice.  Look at you.  What is this?  I'm going to go to L.A.  I'm doing some Leno and I'm doing some Boneyard stuff with Bill Ward, Jack Osborne.  You know how it is.  Why don't you do some Chelsea Handler while you're out there?  I don't know how it is.  What's wrong with you?  Give them a call.  They like you.  The plans changed so much.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't even think about it.  Why don't you do that?  And also, Andy Rooney from yesterday talking about cars and gadgets.  So we've got a lot of radio to do.  So why don't we break right now?  Bobby and Andy show on the virus.  Series XM.  Ash to ash, dust to dust, face to black.  The memories remain.  Fuck you, Metallica. 
[01:05:30]  Metallica.  Yeah.  I like this.  I like it, too.  I should have spoke up yesterday, but I was scared I was going to be bullied.  It's like your grandmother coming into the fucking song and not put this bitch. 
[01:06:00]  It's evil, Anthony.  There's a little evilness here.  Enjoy the evilness.  Oh, you little maggots.  You make me want to vomit.  Yes.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  It's.  They let it go too long at the end.  It's like your dumb fucking grandmother around the house when she's doing laundry. 
[01:06:30]  Why are you yelling?  I'm mad at it.  Grandma, they're doing laundry.  Yeah, she's going around with the hamper.  It's not Metallica.  Old bag.  You old battle axe.  With the hamper.  I hate her.  All right, listen.  Let's do some of this celebrity bullying. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Let's hear who's outraged.  So, I don't know.  I know these celebrities are trying to do the right thing, but on the other side of this  whole thing, they're trying to get their names out there.  That Memory Remains video was fucking cool as shit.  But they're just spinning around on that fucking thing.  But the camera's actually spinning.  And it looks like they're flipping upside down.  Right already.  Let it go.  I can't.  It's fantastic.  Fucking Metallica rules.  Don't forget super celebrity and musician, our own Daniel Mustard, makes a cameo in this 
[01:07:30]  video as well.  Daniel Mustard.  Yeah.  Where is he?  Nothing wrong with Daniel Mustard.  He plays like a wise man or something like that.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  In like a shroud or something.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  She's got the hamper.  Watch your programs.  Let the band play.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Is that the old lady from The Shining singing that at the end?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would flag her.  All right.  Listen.  So, you got the celebrities coming out of the woodwork to do some of this bullying stuff 
[01:08:00]  on the web.  What are you doing in the woodwork in the first place?  I don't know.  And where's Sarah Silverman's?  She did one, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  And everyone wants to get some publicity.  We got a lot of them to play.  You want to play?  I want to hear every one of them.  All right.  This is one of the stars from Glee.  Felt like they had to speak out against celebrities.  Sam's favorite show.  Celebrity bullying.  Cyber bullying.  Chris Colfer.  Celebrity bullying.  Chris Colfer. 
[01:08:30]  Something like that.  Is that a guy?  I don't know.  I don't know what's that fucking show.  Good answer.  Hi.  I'm Chris Colfer.  I still don't know.  I can't tell.  I can't tell.  I don't know what Chris Colfer is, but I want to fuck it.  Wow.  Chris Colfer's balls didn't drop.  Wow.  Or it's a chick.  How old is Chris Colfer before I say that?  80.  All right.  It's got to be a kid.  Hi.  I'm Chris Colfer.  In the last couple weeks, a number of LGBT youth have tragically taken their own lives  due to some ugly circumstances of their environment. 
[01:09:00]  Wait.  If you or anyone you know are also having a rough time, it is vital that you know.  Wouldn't it be more hip to talk about it before everyone else talks about it?  Yeah.  Like a kid like this, I'm assuming this is a kid that knows a little bit about this.  Yeah.  Why didn't you speak up before?  Oh, my God.  It's a guy.  That's a guy.  Yes, of course.  Chris Colfer.  It's a guy.  All right.  That's probably a...  He's probably perched on a bridge.  All of a sudden, teenage bullying.  It's not news.  No.  It's been happening forever. 
[01:09:30]  It's easy to talk out about it now.  You should have talked out about it a year ago.  Two years ago.  Three years ago.  He's dressed like Anthony Hopkins' Puppet Magic.  Six years ago.  He's dressed like Fats.  Puppet's name was Fats.  Pocus.  Pocus.  You're dead.  You're dead.  Fucking love that movie, too.  That is a good one.  Mustard was in the Until It Sleeps video.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, right.  I got my videos mixed up.  Ah, you got your condiments mixed up.  A little info coming in.  Relish was in that one.  Oh, I didn't say that.  That's a good one. 
[01:10:00]  I relish a good joke.  You know, it's nice.  It's vital that you know that there are people out there who care and can help.  I know what it's like to be bullied and teased every single day.  Why?  And I know that it may seem like there is no chance of happiness left, but I promise  you there is a world full of acceptance and love just waiting for you to find it.  Is he gay?  So please.  Is he gay?  How are you as smart as you are with such terrible observation skills?  Well, he says he was bullied, but he's on a fucking TV show.  How bullied could he be? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, really, man.  Yes, Travis?  Yes, Travis?  Isn't he on Glee?  Yes.  Yeah, he was on Glee.  How bullied can you be?  That means that cyberbullying is bullshit.  We're cyberbullied then.  Some kids are jumping off bridges and some kids are starring in hit fucking TV shows.  Have you seen some of my tweets that I get?  My mentions?  Well, I can't keep up with that.  I'm cyberbullied.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's crazy.  You all right?  I'm great.  I got such...  You're so fucking hyper.  I got such a good night's sleep.  All I would ask is just breathe. 
[01:11:00]  Take in a deep breath.  There you go.  Anyway, it's unbullying.  But it does prove it's bullshit.  Some kids are jumping off bridges and other kids are fine and they're fucking big, huge Hollywood stars.  Why are you showing Biff?  Because people are just trying to say bullying has been happening since 1955 at least.  Why don't we blame Biff for...  Biff should really be taken to task.  His bullying at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance was just remarkable. 
[01:11:30]  Not only that, but I mean the diner.  Like, why can't George just go and have some chocolate milk at the diner for?  He didn't want to see him there anymore.  They got computers back then when Biff was doing the cyberbullying?  Because I don't understand that back to the future timeline.  Well, actually, in two, it was the future, so there was some cyberbullying going on, I believe.  Can I get that picture?  There was some hoverboard bullying, I think.  Actually, I think Flea was cyberbullying McFly on the big video phone trying to get him to go in. 
[01:12:00]  So who's the original cyberbully?  Flea.  So let's get a picture of Flea up.  McFly!  Let's get fucking Flea up there.  He started this shit.  Oh, I'm fired up.  What was his character?  Noodles?  Noodles.  Fucking noodles, man.  Noodles rule.  Fucking Flea was noodles.  Let's get the rest of this gay kid's statement out.  Let's hear this poor little child.  So please, before you take a drastic action that could be your last, call the Trevor Project. 
[01:12:30]  Know that you have friends, you are loved, and that you are not alone.  And know that despite such a current, challenging time, there's so much to look forward to.  And I look forward to sharing it with you.  Big, juicy.  I promise it gets so much better.  Oh, I bet.  Thank you.  Shouldn't he have sung his statement?  I promise it gets so much better with a little lubricant.  Well, you know.  So childish.  That picture rule.  Yeah, I am so childish. 
[01:13:00]  Fucking a dough.  Fucking a dandy.  I ain't got nothing else.  I got to tweet the original cyber bully.  Well, first of all.  Oh, you want to see the picture of my kid?  Oh, look at his little hairdo.  He's very cute.  Yeah, we put his hair.  He's got the little spike hair.  I didn't realize that picture was on my phone.  Sorry.  Michael J. Fox.  Sorry to talk about my kid, God forbid.  All right, let's see.  You don't mind if you're talking about your kid?  I'm fucking around.  BTTF2 looks like Michael Douglas with cancer.  Look at him.  Doesn't he?  Yes.  Kind of does.  Except he shakes more. 
[01:13:30]  He's knocking all the chemo stuff on the floor.  All willy-nilly.  He keeps trying to put in the radiation.  His hands are all over.  Is that double necktie going to take off, Danny?  What do you think?  Well, I mean, we've got to give it another few years.  Anything can happen.  Another few or another two?  How many years?  Another five years.  Another five years?  Give it some time, yeah, I dig the...  The double collar necktie thing?  The double Japanese flag rising sun tie.  That is pretty good.  Whatever the hell that is.  Yeah.  I'm digging it.  Stinks those movies. 
[01:14:00]  That whole franchise.  No, it's great.  Stinks.  Don't you love how Needles looks over to the side, like, off camera?  It's like, I got him.  I got him to talk.  And then he cuts off.  Jim, you're not going to get it on Blu-ray?  Come on.  I mean, got to get it on Blu-ray.  Stinks.  Come with us and see the original in the theater.  We're going.  I got extra tickets.  We're going.  It's going to be playing in theater.  Yeah, at Westbury.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's what I'll do.  What night of the week is that?  It's probably a Saturday.  Oh, cool, cool, cool.  Because I know it works Saturdays.  Yeah, blow off some gigs.  Let me know what night.  I'd be happy to go.  It's only...  It's at noon. 
[01:14:30]  You can make tickets.  It's at fucking noon.  We're going to go.  We'll drink some beers.  Cool.  We'll just get loaded and fucking...  Three hours before that, you'll be drinking beers.  Of course.  Noon?  Fuck.  Got to wait till noon, Ann.  You all right?  I can't wait.  Right, Grandma?  I miss Grandma.  Do you miss your Grandma?  Not really.  Yeah, I don't miss my Grandma.  I mean, I miss, you know, what she was, but I don't miss what she was.  Good fuck.  Sorry. 
[01:15:00]  I just slipped out.  It always did.  Big twatted bitch.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  All right.  Make some sauce.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Let me know some of this.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Shut up.  She smells like powder.  La, la, la, la.  Powder and sweaty nylon stockings. 
[01:15:30]  And orthopedic shoes.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  This isn't artistic.  It went on too long.  But I liked it in the song.  It went on too long when she went, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh.  James should have leaned over and just clocked her in the face.  That big fucking Hetfield fist.  Needles rules.  Needles.  Good old needles. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  The next almost celebrity that had to speak about cyberbullying was Wendy Williams.  The big titted monster had this to say about it.  Hi.  I'm Wendy Williams.  I want you to join me in the fight against bullying.  Over the past year, far too many young people have taken their lives due to bullying.  What?  Eighteen-year-old Rutgers University student Tyler Clemente.  Hi.  Fifteen-year-old Phoebe Prince in Massachusetts.  Thirteen-year-old Seth Walsh from California. 
[01:16:30]  Thirteen-year-old Asher Brown from Texas.  And fifteen-year-old Billy Lucas from Indiana.  You know, Jay Moore said it best.  Jay Moore's?  Jay Moore said it best.  Oh!  He said...  Ah, stop the bullying!  Maybe he should say it himself on the show, but he said...  I think it might have been in his book.  I read his book, and his last book was terrific.  He said if he thought his son was gay, the first thing he would do is get him fucking karate lessons. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Think about it.  Yeah.  How many middle school kids could fucking do some karate moves?  There are intolerant people that will never, ever accept gay people or people of other races or whatever.  And you should learn to defend yourself.  That's not a bad place to start.  If you think your kid might be bullied because of his sexuality in school, why wouldn't you get him in a dojo?  Are they called dojos?  A dojo.  Ah, get him on some cement stairs. 
[01:17:30]  Right?  Wouldn't that be the first move?  Yes.  And then I think his second move...  I think he said the second move would be to introduce him to Judy Garland Records or something.  Fucking Jay Moore's.  He couldn't just leave it alone.  Anyone see him in the preview for the Clint Eastwood movie?  Yeah.  Jay's in a Clint Eastwood movie?  Looking fucking creepy on the park bench talking to...  I know.  Matt Damon.  Was he talking to Matt Damon on the bench?  Matt Damon.  Yeah.  He looks...  I don't know what part he's playing, but it's...  It's like he got a fucking good part in a good movie, motherfucker.  Jay can act, man. 
[01:18:00]  Good for Jay Moore.  Jay is a really good fucking actor.  That goddamn Suicide Kings could watch that fucking...  I probably watched it ten times.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  Let's get back to...  Ten times.  Let's get back to Wendy Williams.  Suicide Kings.  Suicide Kings.  Stop cyberbullying.  It's bad for gay kids.  Like Bobo.  Does he like Bobo?  He hates him. 
[01:18:30]  No, he goes, you're gay.  Bobo's gay.  I think he's cyberbullying fucking Bobo.  I'm cyberbullying.  Lucas from Indiana.  Yeah.  It's got to stop.  Does it?  No one deserves to be bullied for any reason.  Why?  If you're the victim of bullying or you witness someone being bullied, say something or tell  an adult.  And if you're a parent, you've got to listen to your child.  Talk to them.  Make sure they understand they are protected, supported, and loved. 
[01:19:00]  And that they're not alone.  Everyone got bullied.  For more information on bullying and how to prevent it, log on to stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov.  HRSA.  That's not as bad because it's bullying in general.  Cyberbullying to me is the new thing that they're talking about.  But bullying is...  She's talking about bullying.  But let me tell you a little something about bullying.  Okay.  Don't bully me.  It just makes you the person that you are.  It happens.  Kids bully each other. 
[01:19:30]  It's like watching puppies bite each other's faces.  That's what they do.  Human nature.  You're stopping human nature.  You're going with human nature.  Right.  Thank you.  It is human nature.  People will bully.  Kids are fucking horrid to each other.  Terrible.  It makes you build a character.  You know what depressed me?  I don't know.  I guess it would be junior high.  Dick size?  No.  I always did good.  Nice.  I did good.  Late bloomer, though.  Yeah, you sure were. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You remember when them little blonde hairs sprouted up?  You go, Uncle Paul, what's happening to my body?  Putting a net down trying to get Opie to jump out of the apple tree.  Remember I had to show you your body's changing, Gregory?  Hair was sprouting.  Yeah, I tweezed it out, though.  Yeah, you don't like hair.  I didn't like it.  I put the little special spit lotion on you. 
[01:20:30]  Helps the hairs stay away.  Damn puberty, right?  Uncle Paul.  I don't like it.  You've got to hate when that happens.  Not a big fan of puberty, are you?  Yeah.  I wish you could just give him a shot.  Sure.  Stay that age.  Yeah.  Let's move on to Lance Bass.  Oh.  Yes.  A gay gentleman, by the way.  Well, I guess.  He came out of the closet.  Is he one of the guys that came out of the closet after his thing was over?  He came out of the closet, yeah.  That's good.  That's good for everybody involved.  Yeah.  Wait till no one gives a shit about you, then tell the world. 
[01:21:00]  That you're gay.  Right.  That's probably...  Oh, I was going to say something.  Probably.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  I'm gay.  Well, if it's the cover of People Magazine, it says NSYNC's Lance Bass and People Magazine  exclusive giant yellow letters, I'm gay underneath it.  I think he's gay.  And then every other magazine, no shit.  The gayest photo ever.  Well, I was really shocked to hear that so many suicides have been happening so recently. 
[01:21:30]  You know, the school year has just begun, so, I mean, that obviously has something to  do with it.  And it just, it makes me so sad to know that these kids, it's just an unnecessary thing  to do.  I mean, I can tell you right now, when I was in high school in Mississippi, I was one of  the first ones to jump on the bandwagon to make fun of a gay person.  And, I mean, look how I turned out.  You know, it's like, I had a secret this whole time.  So, if people can look at me and see that, like, I was one of those bullies that, like,  always made fun of gay people.  And I had this huge secret. 
[01:22:00]  So, there's always a bigger story than what you see.  You know, as a teenager, I really didn't get picked on because I really tried to stay,  you know, in the background.  You know, I tried staying friends with every single person.  But a lot of kids don't have that, are not that lucky to be able to socialize like other  kids.  Some people just don't have that skill or even they want to.  And those are the ones that really get picked on just because they're not best friends with  the most popular person or they don't have the best clothes or, you know, there might 
[01:22:30]  be a little more poor than someone else.  And these kids just don't realize, you know, that that just doesn't matter right now.  It doesn't matter at all.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  What did you say?  What?  What?  I think it was something about gay people.  What is that?  I just want to see something up on the screen there. 
[01:23:00]  Lance Bass.  Why don't we move on to Tim Gunn.  Project Runway.  No, go back.  What did you do?  You're terrible.  Yeah, that one.  There it is.  Isn't that funny?  Let me see.  What are you doing?  That's homo Lance Bass and my girly.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  That's from People Magazine when he came out of the closet.  That's great.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Obviously, he's looking away at a gentleman off camera.  Exactly.  She's pulling at him like, no, this can't be right.  No, she's grabbing him going, please, just get me out of Long Island.  He's crazy.  He has guns.  He's a lunatic.  What is he doing?  He hates anything that can't be traced back to the motherland.  By that, I mean fatherland.  Hey, actually, her great, not even great grandfather, I think it was her grandfather or great grandfather,  might have been one of them, was a Nazi soldier that was found dead, drowned in a river. 
[01:24:00]  So was the grandfather.  You think he's great.  He was murdered.  Yeah.  It was just grandfather.  I said great.  I meant fantastic.  But he was a Nazi.  Yeah.  An authentic Nazi soldier, her grandfather.  It's funny.  I did a Raw Dog show pre-taped yesterday for Tomorrow, me and Bobby, with this comedian named Dustin Chafin,  who I've known for years, and just happened to be in the building.  So we did it with him.  And he was saying how I think his grandfather was a grand wizard in the Klan. 
[01:24:30]  Really?  Because he's from Texas.  Yeah.  And he never knew him.  The guy died.  But it's like, I knew the guy a long time.  I didn't know that.  But he said he was a hardcore Klan, his family.  He said his family brought the Klan from Kentucky to Texas, I believe.  Awesome.  An accomplishment?  Or some, like way, way back, from somewhere to somewhere.  But they actually brought the Klan.  Resume stuffer?  Yeah.  He's not a racist, though.  And by the way.  Oh, he's not, huh?  No.  No, he isn't.  Sorry to hear that.  Tomorrow at 4, you can hear all that excitement on Raw Dog.  Nice. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Cyber bullying.  All the big celebrities are talking about it.  Here's Tim Gunn from Project Runway.  Hi, I'm Tim Gunn, and I have a very important message for gay, lesbian, bisexual,  transgender, and questioning youth.  You're available?  And that is, it gets better.  It really does.  And you may be thinking, what does Tim Gunn understand about my anguish, about my despair,  about how I'm feeling, about my particular time and place in the world right now?  Well, I'll share with you.  As a 17-year-old youth who was in quite a bit of despair, I attempted to kill myself. 
[01:25:30]  And I'm going to worry about it today.  I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I need to end things right now.  And I have to tell you, when I woke up the next morning after taking more than 100 pills,  I was in 400.  Tic-tacs.  I shouldn't be here.  This isn't what was meant to be. 
[01:26:00]  I frankly just wanted to start life all over again.  There are people who can help you.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  All of you.  It really requires a collaboration between you and the people who love you.  Shut up, Tim.  You can depend upon, no matter who they are as mentors.  In my case, it took a very serious intervention.  The boy fights for the PT.  And it was the result of the botched suicide attempt, to be blunt.  I am a huge advocate for the Trevor Project. 
[01:26:30]  Do you want to kiss me?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Suicide Prevention Hotline for GLBT and Questioning Youth.  GLBT.  Shut the fuck up.  How about any teenager that wants to kill himself?  Asshole.  She's got your goddamn pie hole.  Asshole.  Your identity will be protected.  Asshole.  You don't have to worry about getting parents involved if you're so inclined.  I understand the desperation.  I understand the despair.  And I understand how isolated you can feel. 
[01:27:00]  And you have a lot of...  Gay's got it knocked.  Very emotional.  So easy to get laid.  People really care about you.  And I'm included in that group.  So reach out.  Get help.  You're not alone.  It will get better.  I promise.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  Oh, jeez.  Here's what annoys you about celebrities and stuff like this.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  And look, I don't understand what he's doing as noble.  He's coming out and talking about his life.  But it's like, I don't know, maybe I'm just very pro-comedian. 
[01:27:30]  But I've been talking about this shit for years.  Yes.  Who gives a shit?  Right.  I cut my wrists a bunch of...  It's like...  It's a hot topic now.  But the fact that it's like, oh, the actor makes the big revelation.  Right.  Oh, fuck yourselves.  And by the way, this is...  These closed-off assholes.  In a month, they'll move on to something else and won't even give a shit about this topic.  I just don't respect them because they fucking...  These guys never reveal anything.  This is one instance of confused youth killing themselves.  It's tragic, but you know something? 
[01:28:00]  There are kids that kill themselves because their grades aren't good, because their parents  molested them, because they fucking feel inferior.  Because they got rejected by a girl.  They got rejected by a girl.  Right.  Same thing.  This is just another instance of, you know, you're gay.  It's tough to deal with.  Some people can, and they do.  And then other people kill themselves, like they do with any other stressful thing in life.  How about what they do?  The real issue here is not cyberbullying. 
[01:28:30]  It is fucking privacy and invasion of privacy.  And I'm saying that because it's funny how nobody is talking about that, because Americans  love invading privacy.  Oh, my God.  We love looking...  Those guys were doing nothing different.  It was creepy and very disgusting that they showed this guy's private life.  But what's the difference between that and the morbid curiosity everybody has from  Mel Gibson's private life falling apart, or Tiger Woods' private life falling apart,  or Jesse, we can't get enough of sticking our fucking faces in people's private lives. 
[01:29:00]  The fucking voyeuristic hotel room fucking nude tape.  We love it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We love it.  So what's the problem with this?  This is a byproduct of this shitty culture.  Yes.  That's what it is.  It's a byproduct of it, is people feel entitled to spy and to get information that's none of  their fucking business.  Brilliant, Jimmy.  You're right.  But that's what this is.  You're right.  It's not about cyberbullying.  Nope.  We got a guy on my Twitter, Bill Hart.  Hello, Bill!  Hart!  Bill Hart Rand FT.  Nice fucking Twitter name. 
[01:29:30]  That's easy to find if you're looking for followers.  He writes, two 13-year-olds tried bullying my 11-year-old.  They found out the hard way that he's been in MMA classes since he was nine.  Aw, shit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Wow.  If you think you got kind of a wimpier kid or a sensitive kid, get him into some fucking  self-defense classes immediately.  That would be good.  Nice spinning back kick to the face.  And Troy wants to defend our artistic gay kids.  Where's Troy, man?  Wow.  Is he going to make a statement like one of those fucking celebrity tapes? 
[01:30:00]  Should we call People Magazine?  I think this is an exclusive.  This, ladies and gentlemen, by the way, is not a recording.  This isn't one of the tapes that we've been playing here on the show.  This is our own Troy, and he will be speaking out, defending artistic gay kids in this environment  of what we call cyberbullying.  No, Sam was fucking with me.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  Sam was fucking with me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Here he comes. 
[01:30:30]  No, we were talking about boring.  Sam is an ass and deserves to be bullied.  I'm told that this is not true, and Sam's coming in.  Oh, really?  Sam?  Sam, what happened?  What's the problem here?  I just think we should all...  You didn't make light of this, by the way.  No, I'm not.  I'm ashamed.  I'm gay-friendly.  I'm the friend of the gays here on the show.  No shit, you're made out with men on this very show.  It's nothing to me.  Yeah.  But I just think that we should all be in an environment where we can express ourselves,  and Troy shouldn't express one opinion in the phone screen room and be afraid to say  it on the air.  Oh, what was his opinion in the phone screen room? 
[01:31:00]  Well, because Travis was showing some pictures of when he was a kid, and I told Travis that I wished  he was picked on more as a kid so he would have killed himself.  I so would have probably molested Travis as a young child.  Of course.  Travis was very molestable.  When he's holding that cat, and he's got his long hair, and he dyed it and everything.  You've got to see the pictures of him on the safety patrol.  No, he wasn't on safety patrol, was he?  He had a sash and everything.  But then Troy was talking about, you know, it's not what's wrong with being different. 
[01:31:30]  Kids don't have it figured out yet.  Wait, is he preaching to people or screening calls?  What are you doing?  This was a conversation between Sam and I.  Because Sam picked on a girl while the calls are building up.  Well, once the phone bank is filled.  Who's that?  That's Travis as the safety patrol.  You look like one of the duck and cover kids from Atomic Cafe.  Safety patrol was very coveted in elementary school. 
[01:32:00]  What did you do, patrol cocks to make sure that no cum leaked out of them?  I like that.  I like how your helmet doubles as a cereal bowl.  Look at it.  It's awful.  No, it does.  I swear.  It's just that.  And wasn't the sash supposed to be, like, white?  No, it was orange so you could see me.  No, the old days it was white and you had a badge on it.  Not in the late 80s.  Ah, yeah, fuck.  Well, mine was the Hitler Youth.  Maybe that's what I was thinking.  People took me seriously when I was... 
[01:32:30]  No, they didn't.  ...keeping people away from the water fountain before and after school.  Look at you.  You are so punchable.  Like, if you told me to do anything in school, I would have socked you, as they say.  People took me seriously.  Oh, my God.  Look at his big glasses.  That's fifth grade.  And, again, you were safety patrol.  Yeah.  What the fuck was wrong with you?  You want to be?  Nothing.  I was very popular.  Why didn't you go into law enforcement?  Yeah, why aren't you a cop now?  It wasn't for me.  I got my fill with safety patrol.  Yeah.  And I did the morning announcements.  Do you have a taser? 
[01:33:00]  No.  Baton?  No.  Sap?  What did you use to fucking lay some of these kids down when they tried to cross against  the green?  My stare.  Oh, man.  Yeah, through those glasses?  Yeah.  With your doe eyes, you fruit?  That's very cool.  You're very well-kempt.  What happened?  I don't know.  Yeah.  If you could grow a beard back then, you'd have been the mess you are now.  I was very innocent back then.  Yes, you were.  Straight A's.  Very good.  Very proud. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Please put those up on Twitter.  They're nothing short of fantastic.  Can I see that picture?  This one or the other one?  Oh.  Nice exposure, dick.  Oh, safety patrol.  Oh, my God.  Fucking...  I wish you would have ended up like Eitan Pates.  Too bad...  That's too mean.  What?  Adam?  No, no, no.  That's what I wanted to say about Travis.  Yes.  Yes.  Too bad you didn't...  Come on. 
[01:34:00]  That's a meanie.  Too bad you didn't...  Too bad you didn't stand in front of your mother's vagina and guard against giant Jewish  cocks that might slip in.  Oh, shit.  What a callback.  She ran off of the...  She ran off of the Jew.  I'm sorry.  You should have been safety patrol of Jewish cocks.  Look at us bullying.  How about shoving that helmet up our vagina so a big Jewish dick couldn't go in there? 
[01:34:30]  Nah, we're bullying.  We're cyberbullying him now.  Open a window.  He's ready to jump.  Kill yourself.  Mom.  Kill yourself.  You guys are offending Troy, though.  He doesn't like this type of stuff.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't play this game.  He's sitting back.  He's an artsy kid.  He's very offended.  Yeah, he's an artsy kid.  Yeah, he is.  You're an artsy kid.  I don't like the bullying either.  Oh, God.  What the fuck are you, Topo G-Joe?  He's wearing a little white suit.  He looks like he's waiting for the plane.  What a creep.  You're a dick.  Hope he winds up the same way as Herve Village is, too. 
[01:35:00]  I was seven, and that was my first dress-up party.  Really?  Whatever that meant.  Dress-up party.  Is that what they called it back then, when older men would take photos of you with other  older men?  Let's take a picture of your first dress-up party.  Now, change into this.  Yeah.  Look at you.  It's a prom dress.  He's wearing like a white tuxedo with a tie.  Where are you going?  A business meeting?  Look at you.  You're a little wreck.  Exactly.  You're dressed like fucking Pablo Estrebar.  You were a very cute little kid there, Travis. 
[01:35:30]  I was adorable.  I know.  You weren't adorable.  You had giant sleeves.  I was.  I was very cute.  Fucking AIDS arms.  Very popular.  Shut up, fucking teeny arms.  Fucking giant sleeves make me sick.  I certainly would.  By the way, I don't like your awkward polio legs, either.  How awful do his legs look?  It is like, you're kind of crooked.  What happened?  What happened to your legs, Travis?  A little fucking scoliosis?  Turn back that fucking overexposed shitty photo, please.  I have no idea.  I think I have great legs.  Did your parents have high hopes for you? 
[01:36:00]  What is that?  Very high hopes for me.  Yeah, because they dressed you like that.  What is that picture?  You're all bruised up.  What was that, after the fire?  That's some...  Finger painting.  Your finger painting on your body?  Yeah, you're showing how to...  Your body's a canvas.  Is that it, Uncle Paul?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me show you how to make the letter I.  You look like a little jungle boy.  We had fun growing up.  Oh, did you?  Before it all went wrong. 
[01:36:30]  When mommy got for the Jew.  Before that Jew fucking stole your mother away.  When did you know it was all wrong?  When she was cooking and she was humming,  huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.  Standing bow-legged.  After she got a tremendous deep dick.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, two matzo balls on her nose.  Travis, where are we at with this?  Have you talked to mommy lately?  No, I haven't.  In how long now?  It'll be...  It's been nine and a half years. 
[01:37:00]  What the fuck is that picture?  What?  It's you dressed up like Abraham Lincoln?  I was the lead in the play.  What play?  Abraham Lincoln.  What play do you think?  I thought the play was, look on, fucked up our country.  See, because he doesn't like black people.  No, I'm just saying, you know, the Civil War and everything.  Suddenly he says that every day.  No, no, it had nothing to do with that.  Oh, look at his little legs, still not working properly.  Little fucking cultish fawn legs.  God, those need braces, Forrest Gump. 
[01:37:30]  I really wish that the guy who played Wilkes Booth was a method actor.  I know, the end of the play should be you laying on a bed with a pillow that's all red with your blood.  How funny was Otto when he was saying the guy shot him because he was six foot nine in the theater with a top hat.  He couldn't...  He's like, this cocksucker's hat is on, honey.  I can't see the band.  That was why he got shot.  I can't see the band.  I can't see the band.  Cocksucker with his hat.  And he's holding George.  That's very funny.  That's fantastic.  I can't see the band. 
[01:38:00]  You were the lead in the play as Lincoln.  And what was the play, though?  I have no idea.  I just remember that the beard was incredibly scratchy.  Did you have to recite the Gettysburg Address?  The beard.  Don't call her that.  Oh, you did.  Can you do it now?  No.  Four score and seven years ago?  That's all I know.  That's all you know?  Yeah.  I know that I had to do that.  That was probably the age when Travis started playing Undie Flip.  All right.  Well...  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Sorry.  What is that, Travis?  I didn't...  What is it?  Does Undie Flip never come up on the air?  What's Undie Flip? 
[01:38:30]  I forgot.  Sorry, dude.  I need to know what Undie Flip is.  He'll tell you.  It's a game he used to play.  Travis, what is Undie Flip?  I don't know if I can tell you without just laughing hysterically.  Well, we'll be the judge of whether you should laugh or not.  All right.  Undie Flip is...  Look at him.  He can't say it.  I have images, but what is Undie Flip?  It's me and my brother.  Oh, no.  This is bad already. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, Undie Flip.  Uncle Paul knows.  Okay.  What's Undie Flip?  He's fucking freaking out.  No, it's not.  It's just...  They've known about this for like four years.  I've never heard of Undie Flip.  I feel deprived.  It's been saved, I guess.  So, Undie Flip is...  Me and my brother, we would take our underpants and put them down by... 
[01:39:30]  He just starts cracking up.  Fucking laughing.  We'd put them down by our feet.  Yeah.  You know, it was still on one of our legs.  Now, you're naked, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, you and your brother...  You see how he was cleverly trying to get around that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a key part here.  You and your brother are totally naked.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, your underwear are down by your...  Where?  By our foot.  Just on one ankle.  On one foot.  Yeah, just one ankle.  All right.  One ankle.  And our kitchen, we had kind of like... 
[01:40:00]  Lubricant.  Men.  Cameras rolling.  A bunch of jerking off guys.  A cracker.  With Polaroids.  Watching the fucking Teft Boys.  These goddamn Teft Boys know how to put on a show.  Look at Lincoln.  Undie flipping.  Yeah.  They'd make him put on the stovepipe hat, and they'd rape him. 
[01:40:30]  They'd fucking...  They'd rape him with the fucking...  What's the thing that needs the dough?  Oh, a roller?  Yeah, the rolling pin.  A dough roller?  Yeah.  A rolling pin.  That's it.  Hey, so what happened?  So, it's one leg.  So, yeah, our kitchen kind of had like...  It was almost like a ceiling before the ceiling.  I don't know how to explain it.  It's like a shirt before the shirt.  Yeah, it's called a floor, asshole.  Or we would try and aim for the fan.  We had ceiling fans.  I believe the ceiling before the ceiling, what was it?  Like a... 
[01:41:00]  And then one part of the ceiling went higher than the rest of it?  Yeah, it was wooden, and there was maybe like, you know, like five feet between our  ceiling and...  So, you would aim for the fan?  It's almost cathedraled a little.  Yeah, or the fan.  I'm a big fan.  So, you'd take the underwear on one foot...  Yeah.  ...and flip it off your foot.  Yeah, we would, you know, kick it.  Now, I do this going to bed at night, usually.  I'll take it and try to flip it into the hamper.  Yeah, but we're going for, you know, severe elevation.  But it's never with my brother. 
[01:41:30]  And you're not nude?  Not...  Well, you know, but I'm alone or, you know, with somebody, and that is not my brother.  So, we did that.  And does not have a penis.  All right.  So, we do things differently.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you'd flip it up into the ceiling fan.  Yeah.  And it would whoosh away, and hopefully skid-marked underwear would hit your brother in the face.  Well, the ceiling fan would be usually inactive.  Oh, okay, good, good.  And then we would see if we can get it on top.  Okay, well, that's a fun game.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  It was called Undie Flip.  Homosexuals.  Exactly.  No wonder she left for the Jew.  Your mom.  She didn't have to deal with fucking Undie Flip.  That's just one of the games we played.  With the new family that she got that was better than her old family.  That included you.  The horrid son.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I say that?  What?  That was pretty bad.  Troy doesn't like that stuff.  I don't care.  Yeah, Troy.  Enough about me.  I mean, Troy, the artsy kid.  Troy likes people to be nice.  He doesn't, he thinks, you know, the creative kids get made fun of, and, you know, everybody's 
[01:42:30]  a conformist, you know?  That's what he was saying.  You know, he likes non-conformists.  Troy, was that what we were saying?  Is that your Lady Gaga shirt?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Madison Square Gaga.  Yeah, he has no problem wearing a Lady Gaga shirt.  Okay.  Anyway, um...  He was just bragging, and he was picking on everybody, and...  I was explaining stories.  I wasn't bragging.  And I was just like, you know, do you want everybody to be exactly like you?  You know, I mean, there are kids out there that are different, and they grow up and, you  know, become different things, and I got picked on a lot as a kid, so...  Now, why?  What was your problem?  Like, obviously, it probably wasn't a problem, but people, kids at that age will interpret 
[01:43:00]  somebody with maybe more of a flamboyant personality as a problem child.  Right.  What was your deal?  I was a little weird.  What was weird about you?  I just looked weird.  I was very tall, had big ears, just very awkward looking, wore weird clothes, and...  But, you know, if you were kind of, like, fun and shit, people will overlook that stuff.  Yeah, I was a little quiet, just kind of stuck to myself, and I got picked on a lot, and 
[01:43:30]  I just learned how to fight.  So you had to duke it out with people?  Yeah.  Are you a good fighter?  I haven't been in a fight in quite some time, but I was...  There was a period of time I was getting into a lot of fights, yeah.  Were you good at it?  I was okay, yeah.  You defended yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't get your ass.  That's what we're talking about.  What sport did they walk into the locker room, and they saw you with another boy's athletic  supporter over your face, and you were singing, I'm a little teapot?  Were you undie-flipping in the locker room with Travis? 
[01:44:00]  Someone's jock onto your face.  The first real good fight I had was in high school.  The captain of the football team was just repeatedly picking on me and picking on me.  I love this movie.  And did he put tape on your ass and rip it off, and then have to go to detention?  And his father yelled at him?  Actually, there was a whole ordeal, but I got him fired, not deliberately, from a job that  we both worked at.  Good job.  Good job.  And, well, I had pneumonia, and he wanted me to work, and he forced me to work, and he 
[01:44:30]  got fired for it.  Anyway.  Fagging pneumonia.  So he picked on me for the past three months, and this guy was massive, big, huge guy.  Yeah.  And I just had enough one day, and I had a can of mace, and I waited for him as he  walked into school.  And there was a bus entrance, and he, I mean, this kid would throw me up against...  Is that what you called your asshole?  Yeah.  He would throw me up against the...  He just goes, yeah.  Well, I mean, this kid would throw me up against the lockers and bang my head off the lockers,  and it was, I just had enough of it.  So I was waiting for him with a can of mace, and he walked up the stairs, and I flicked 
[01:45:00]  him off, and he came over to me, and he was like, you know, what the fuck is this?  And I sprayed him with mace, and then I just swung, and I just clocked him as hard as I  could in the face.  And I hit him so hard, I shit my pants.  And then...  Wow, that's a great punch.  Didn't that happen in Rocky IV?  Yeah.  I fucking roll.  So I just got on top of him, and I just unloaded on his face, and I had a big dump in my pants. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, that's hot, yeah.  Wow.  Did he smush your fucking dump in his face?  Oh, that would have been great if he would have just smear your shit like a fucking ape.  Just smear your shit in his face.  Yeah, that would have been great.  Oh, mace and shit.  So what happened?  I got expelled.  Oh, really?  Did he get expelled for that?  Yeah.  He told on you, or someone saw it?  Well, I mean, it was a whole ordeal.  I mean, it was right in the bus interest.  What for shitting your pants?  Why'd you get expelled for defending yourself?  Because I maced him.  That was the problem.  Fuck.  Did they know you shit your pants?  I was sitting in the principal's office, and I stunk up the whole thing. 
[01:46:00]  Nice.  How old were you again?  I was like junior year of high school, so like 17.  17 years shitting your pants.  Yeah, I hit him so hard.  I mean, I put everything I had into that punch.  Did you ever see him again?  You rocked.  Occasionally, yeah.  He punches you, he shits his pants, he maces you.  You got to watch that guy.  Yeah.  You're crazy, man.  I mean, you just do a couple things like that, and people stop fucking with you real quick.  You're a crazy man.  I like that.  Cool.  All right, Troy.  All right, no bullying for you.  Exactly.  You guys want to type this first.  That's how you handle it. 
[01:46:30]  You don't jump off a bridge.  You shit your pants.  Exactly.  You fucking mace him like a coward, then shit your pants like a cancer patient.  Then push it in his face.  Doing a rock and a hut, please.  Oh, my God.  Do we have to look at these fucking photos now?  You shit your pants.  You can't win, Rock.  This guy will shit his pants inside of three rounds.  It could have beat old Wetwoods.  You guys want to hear more celebrities talking about cyberbullying?  I just shit my pants.  Yes.  Do we? 
[01:47:00]  I love cyberbullying.  We got Cindy Lauper left, Ellen DeGeneres, Kathy Griffin.  Oh, I hate Cindy Lauper.  I don't think anybody should bully this.  Just because she has a wacky voice.  This September, when kids should be going back to school and celebrating a new school year  and learning new things, four young men took their lives.  They took their lives because they were bullied.  They were bullied for being gay or suspected of being gay. 
[01:47:30]  This is an epidemic.  Oh, four people is an epidemic?  Look, I'm not trying to be insensitive, but four people...  You gotta do the numbers.  ...does not an epidemic make.  No.  I'm sorry.  I understand.  It's bad.  I'm not fucking saying it's not.  Look, I'm not.  But four people and calling it an epidemic is a little fucking dramatic.  Cindy.  Teenagers have been committing suicide forever. 
[01:48:00]  Because of Aussie records.  Everyone knows that's why they do it.  It's not.  It's not his fault.  Of course it is.  He makes you want to live.  Oh, does he?  What about suicide solution, man?  But it's against alcohol.  They used to blame the records.  Now they're blaming cyberbullying.  Yeah, cyberbullying now.  It's just everything.  Come on.  Kids will always off themselves.  Whatever.  Didn't they blame Dungeons and Dragons at one point, too?  There's always something to blame.  The darkness of Dungeons and Dragons calls kids to kill themselves? 
[01:48:30]  There are many others, and this goes on all the time.  If you are being bullied and you are contemplating suicide, please, instead, make a phone call.  Call the Trevor Project Helpline.  Take a moment.  Reconnect.  There are people out there to help you.  Reconnect like docking?  Maybe you shouldn't name your kid Trevor.  Yeah, that's a bad one. 
[01:49:00]  Or Travis.  Or Travis.  If you're a parent who suspects your child is being bullied, please get involved.  Smack them around.  There are organizations that can help you.  There's P flag, for instance.  What?  Was started by parents whose children were gay.  Please get involved.  If you are a parent who suspects their kid is bullying another child for their sexual orientation,  please get involved. 
[01:49:30]  You'll lose your kid to hate and fear.  When a child or a young person acts out in hate and fear, you lose them.  It wrecks their life.  We need all our kids.  Please get involved and teach them that different is okay.  I am bored with that one.  You want to move on to the next one?  I was made fun of.  I had one pair of sneakers that I had to clean the corrals in and go to school in.  And my sneakers smelled like horse shit.  Every day I went to school and I smelled like horse shit. 
[01:50:00]  Did you have to fight your way through school?  No, because I was a faggot.  I was a little pussy.  I got smacked around.  I had fucking zits that were horrid.  So why didn't you jump off a bridge?  Because I...  What caused you not to jump off a bridge?  I didn't want to die.  I figured it would get better.  That's a good point.  Eventually, something would happen.  And then Buzz came in and sucked my dick and everything got better.  My brother introduced me to pot.  It was a wonderful life.  It went from black and white to color.  Oh, it was fantastic.  All of a sudden I could give a shit that my sneakers were green and smelled like horse shit. 
[01:50:30]  Maybe they should pass out pot in junior high.  Yes.  That would mellow everyone the fuck out.  Little homosexual children would love it.  It's coming very close to that in California anyway.  Yeah, it really is.  We're pulling for California, aren't we?  Yes.  I honestly can't wait.  I think it's actually pretty exciting.  I think you'll see pot legalized probably in the next 10 years.  In our lifetime!  It's going to be really interesting.  Alcohol legal, pot not.  It's just ridiculous.  It's silly.  It's ridiculous.  I had no idea. 
[01:51:00]  Already in Massachusetts, you can carry under an ounce.  It's just like a speeding ticket.  You pay like a stupid fine.  You still just get a ticket.  Right, right.  I'm getting there.  They don't arrest you.  It's because we're so desperate in this country.  We need to make a new fucking income for this country.  That's the only reason.  And open up the prisons to people that are fucking like raping people.  There's too many people that are arrested for pot possession.  Who gives a shit?  All right, let's move on to Ellen DeGeneres.  Ah, this is what I want to hear. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  Oh, I mean, I absolutely don't care.  I am devastated over the death of 18-year-old Tyler Clemente.  Devastated?  If you don't know, Tyler was a bright student at Rutgers University whose life was...  Not too bright.  Yeah, apparently not.  Cover up that webcam when you're sucking a dick, stupid.  Exactly.  Look at the fucking webcam.  If the light's on, stop it.  Put a fucking shirt over it.  I've done that.  Like, there's so many different ways you could access your computer remotely these days. 
[01:52:00]  If I'm just not sure about something or if I just get a weird feeling,  I will absolutely cover up that little pinhole camera in an iMac or whatever.  Don't fall the fucking screen down.  It's done.  You never know.  They won't.  It's not...  Look, the thing is, him being gay is not the issue.  Maybe that's what depressed him.  Invasion of pride.  I keep saying it.  It's invasion of pride.  But it's such...  It's such a sense of entitlement we have learned to feel  to see people's personal eyes strewn all over the front, morbidly curious. 
[01:52:30]  We love it.  We're very voyeuristic.  We fucking love the details.  We love it.  We love to hear, who did he cheat with?  What happened?  Oh, he said nigger on the phone in a private conversation.  What happened?  What did he do wrong?  All things we're not supposed to know about.  There's audio.  There's video.  I gotta hear it.  I gotta see it.  I gotta do it.  We can't get enough.  And then we wonder why two college students are gonna do something shitty and invasive.  Yeah.  It's not a mystery as to why they did that.  Yeah, where'd they get the idea, where'd they get the fuck, where'd they see it done 
[01:53:00]  before?  It's every...  How about Perez Hilton?  How about...  It's like, you're a part of the problem, scumbag.  TMZ.  All those shows.  You're a part of this morbid voyeurism.  You're a part of this throwing people's personal lives all over the place.  Yep.  Things that are not the public's business.  You make that acceptable.  So don't sit there and wonder why two dumb college students all of a sudden...  Look, when you're 18, if you think your roommate is blowing guys, you're not mature enough  to go, wow, this is an agonizing thing that he has to keep a secret.  He's gonna kill himself.  I gotta get this on tape. 
[01:53:30]  You're not looking at the consequences of how devastating that is.  But let's not act shocked when we're all fucking guilty of it.  We love it.  Yeah.  We love it as a country.  Where is that side of the story?  Where are people telling that side of the story?  Because they're all a part of it.  If they videotaped this kid and they showed him and they go, he's a faggot, then that's  the issue.  Right.  But I think the problem is this dummy was just spying on his roommate being a creep.  And it's like, holy shit, look, he's engaged in some sex here. 
[01:54:00]  But because...  Check it out.  Where was this voice of outrage when other details were coming out that we found interesting?  Yeah.  There was no voice of outrage.  We love it.  Yeah.  So stop being dishonest and stop pretending we don't understand why people spy.  We fucking can't get enough.  Damn.  We should have had a webcam on you.  Oh my God.  Right.  Just don't tell me.  That could have went viral right there.  It's funny.  With Paris Hilton or whatever, when that came out or whatever, all these mock sex tapes 
[01:54:30]  that come out, we're kind of trained that that's acceptable now.  That's great.  Love that.  It's hot.  It makes you famous.  It's...  What?  Lindsay Lohan photographed with a hypodermic needle?  Oh my God.  Where's the picture?  I gotta see it.  Yeah.  Didn't...  Hey, didn't...  By the way, didn't Perez Hilton get in trouble for showing, like, Miley Cyrus with her fucking  legs open or something?  Yes.  Wow.  Really?  That's the way to treat a teenager?  Yeah.  To fucking show what her panties are, her pussy?  That could have been devastating to her.  That hypocrisy.  Fucking phony.  He's the biggest fucking phony as far as a cyberbullying guy. 
[01:55:00]  By the way, just...  And I mean, just as research, Danny, punch that picture up.  Just so I could research it and see exactly...  Holy fuck.  Wow.  So a paparazzi camera catching, whether it's Brittany or somebody else's pussy sticking  out, is put out on every website, and it's acceptable, but this college student is  a terrible guy if he wants to secretly film...  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's very similar.  Believe me, these college students are pieces of shit.  And Perez Hilton, who's speaking out, is so guilty of what you're talking about. 
[01:55:30]  Of course he is.  And I'm not defending the college students.  They're scumbags.  No, obviously, yeah.  But you can't just put the blame there and act like we have no idea how it happened.  It's part of our culture.  Yep.  This is what we become.  We're a shit culture, and that's what we get.  His life was senselessly cut short.  He was outed as being gay on the internet, and he killed himself.  Something must be done.  This month alone, there have been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have  been teased and bullied and then committed suicide, like 13-year-old Seth Walsh in Tehachapi, 
[01:56:00]  California.  What?  13-year-old Asher Brown in Cypress, Texas.  And 15-year-old Billy Lucas in Greensburg, Indiana.  Billy!  This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone that teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic  in this country, and the death rate is climbing.  One life lost in a senseless way is tragic.  Four lives lost is a crisis.  You know what?  It's not a crisis.  By the way...  It sucks.  Trust me.  It sucks.  For those families and the friends of those... 
[01:56:30]  More people kill themselves as adolescents because they just don't feel accepted in any way.  Fuck the...  It doesn't matter if they're gay or anything, or they don't feel like they're performing  well in life.  Their family life sucks.  It has nothing to do with...  You can't just point out one part of this.  You should point out the whole fucking thing.  And as far as her saying that he was outed as being gay on the internet, I mean, it does  suck.  I'm not saying it doesn't suck.  But it's like every celebrity rag outs people.  Oh my god, they love catching someone being gay. 
[01:57:00]  They couldn't get enough fucking Ricky Martin pictures.  Yeah.  They couldn't get enough pictures of this guy or that guy.  Neither could I.  Is he gay?  Who didn't?  With him and the other fella doing yoga with a towel?  Oh, the jet ski.  But it's like the whole fucking shitty country loves to catch two guys walking together.  Is this one a lesbian?  They speculate on who's gay.  They forced Ricky Martin out, basically.  Of course they did.  With the pictures they got of him.  Stop acting shocked.  John Travolta smooching on the steps of that plane.  Dude, it happens everywhere.  Yep.  And then they think that it's like, because this guy was out on the internet, how could 
[01:57:30]  anyone do that?  Yeah.  They've trained people how to fucking do this shit.  They've trained you that it's acceptable.  And we have not stressed as a country, because we're fucking curious, how sickening these  invasions of people's private lives are.  Not one person came out when Dog the Bounty Hunter was saying nigger on the phone and  said, yeah, the guy's an asshole, but this is not our fucking business.  Between family members.  Right.  Not one major paper came out and said, Tiger Woods' private life. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  It's sickening that we should look at this.  It's not our business.  And that's not invasion of privacy in the same way that this was?  Of course it is.  It's not cyberbullying, it's invasion of privacy.  And the news does it all the time.  These rags do it all the time.  The papers do it.  Yeah.  They all do it.  Perez Hilton does it.  And that's why Ellen doesn't bother me as much, because I don't think she does it.  Where's that fucking side?  That's the issue.  But Ellen isn't fucking speaking against the mainstream media that does this constantly.  Every day on the news you'll see some invasion of privacy. 
[01:58:30]  Invasion of privacy.  Because that should be viewed as the taboo.  Because let's say the guy was not gay.  Let's say this guy was masturbating and was humiliated and killed himself.  Or let's say he was in...  How big was his dick?  Hopefully juicy.  All right.  And his balls are hairy or not?  What if he had low hangers?  I just want the details, Jim.  What if he was fooling around with a girl whose father thought she was a virgin?  So it was a heterosexual thing, and in a humiliated way, she killed herself. 
[01:59:00]  It's not about being gay.  It's about the fucking invasion of privacy.  I don't mean to keep repeating it.  No problem.  It's the thing I hate about our culture.  Sexuality does not come into this.  No, it's part of it.  Yeah, but I think in this one, the invasion of privacy is the bigger picture.  Absolutely.  Lost is a crisis.  And these are just the stories we hear about.  How many other teens have we lost?  How many others are suffering in silence?  Being a teenager and figuring out who you are is hard enough without someone attacking you.  I know who I was.  My heart is breaking for their families, for their friends, and for our society that continues to let this happen. 
[01:59:30]  These kids needed us, and we have an obligation to change this.  There are messages everywhere that validate this kind of bullying and taunting, and we have to make it stop.  We can't let intolerance and ignorance take another kid's life.  And I want anyone out there who feels different and alone to know that I know how you feel.  And there is help out there, and you can find support in your community.  If you need someone to talk to or if you want to get involved, there are some really great organizations listed on our website. 
[02:00:00]  Things will get easier, people's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it.  You know what?  She's doing good.  I like Ellen a lot, man, and I think she's genuine and sincere.  But if you want to fight stuff like this, begin attacking all of these outlets, whether it's Radar Online or all of the ones that, A, help celebrities by showing you.  Yeah.  Begin attacking them, for real attacking them for the invasions. 
[02:00:30]  Don't support these invasions of privacy.  See, that's how you start doing something like that.  Such shit.  We got Kathy Griffin and Perez Hilton left.  Kathy Griffin's just a goofball.  I like Kathy, too.  I mean, Perez is the only one that really annoys me.  So why don't we move right on to Perez Hilton?  Because he's guilty of it.  He is the biggest cyberbully out there.  His site is fucking huge.  Hypocritical fucking cunt.  Cumbubbles, tocks.  Yeah.  Cocaine dripping out of noses. 
[02:01:00]  I cannot stand this motherfucker.  Uh, and he's going to speak out about cyberbullying.  Yeah, let's hear this.  This is completely insane.  It's disgusting.  It's what he does.  That's his job.  He's made a fine living.  His career is cyberbullying.  Uh, not just Hollywood.  Anybody in the news.  And calling little girls whores and shit.  And people that are right.  People that are not even of age.  Exactly.  So.  And showing that private shot, or showing private shots that would be humiliating to someone. 
[02:01:30]  This motherfucker.  You gotta take the good with the bad.  He would put a humiliating photo that someone was not posing for up in a second.  Uh-huh.  And embarrass somebody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dickhead.  Why isn't anyone calling him out on this?  Because he's gay, and he's fucking speaking out on this.  No one listens to us.  You gotta work on fucking eggshells.  People just think we're fucking goofball shock jocks.  But how about someone calls Perez Hilton out on this shit?  Yeah.  Look at all the cum bubble shots.  Oh. 
[02:02:00]  Look at the cocked shots that he draws.  Yeah.  Big fucking cocks.  Yeah, Perez Hilton's right.  Exactly.  He draws cocks in people's faces, and then wonders why.  Yeah.  Where this homophobia comes from.  You're presenting a dick in a man's mouth as if it's this bad thing.  An insult.  As an insult.  And an insult to somebody.  Yet you don't want people to talk about it like it's an insult.  You phony.  You're a fucking hypocritical cock.  You phony motherfucker. 
[02:02:30]  You're a cocksucker, hypocritical fuckwad.  And his argument would be, well, I do it to women, too.  Oh, shut it.  We all understand the difference between a dick drawn in a girl's face and the implications of that and a dick drawn in a girl's face.  We all get that.  Right.  So don't play that semantics game.  Let's go to his dumb audio.  All right.  Hello.  My name is Perez.  You may know me from my website, Perez.  You know, my website where I draw cum bubbles and cocks on pictures.  Yeah.  And I sell that website.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  PerezHilton.com.  And this video is directed and made with love for those of you who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,  and having a difficult time being whom you were born.  If you're in high school, if you're in middle school, and you're finding it difficult to go to school, to be accepted by your family,  I'm here to tell you it gets better.  Not everything gets better. 
[02:03:30]  You'll still get pimples like I have on my nose.  But most everything in life...  Cum will get that out.  Just get a little...  Rub a little cum on that, and that'll clear up your pimples on your nose.  I hate this guy.  Fucking wad he is.  Not because he's gay.  He's just a dude.  I hate him because he contributes nothing.  Absolutely.  He's like when Wall Street would liquidate.  They would capitalize on other people's things.  He's just a blogger who contributes nothing. 
[02:04:00]  He's not funny.  He's not a good writer.  He's not creative.  He's simply a poster of information.  He stinks.  Our pal Brendan's on the line, who of course is a big part of whatwouldtylerdurtondo.com.  Oh, yes.  WTDD.com.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, my fellow, good morning.  I just wanted to mention that Perez actually takes credit for outing Lance Bass because for years he would go on his website and scream that Bass was gay, 
[02:04:30]  even though he hadn't come out of the closet yet.  And when he eventually did, Perez actually took credit for it and said he was right to do it to out other gay kids.  And there was a show called Kyle XY, I think on Disney Channel.  And he tried to out that kid, too, for years.  So he's cyberbullying.  I mean, Lance Bass didn't feel like telling the world he was gay yet.  Oh, yeah.  He did the exact same thing these kids did.  He went on the Internet and said this kid who was trying to have a private life is gay, and we should all know about it. 
[02:05:00]  So why is no one calling – you guys should call him out on your site for it because you guys have a big site and you have a big voice, man.  And it really is – it's amazing how they're all concentrating only on the fact that the kid who killed himself, which was very sad, was gay.  But that, to me, is not the issue.  The issue is invasion of privacy, and it's all this shit.  And these guys – and Perez is guilty of that.  It's what he does.  I'm a piece of shit, though. 
[02:05:30]  At least I admit it.  I don't pretend to be anything different.  But, dude, you have a site, and the difference is you're not on the Miss America pageant making self-righteous, sanctimonious statements about what's right and wrong,  and then going on your site and drawing cum on people's eyeballs.  You know, it's like what Perez Hilton is doing is he's a dirtbag, and he's a cornball, and he draws dicks on faces,  and then he tries to be this fucking – this poignant changer of social issues, and he's an asshole.  Yeah, he actually thinks he's noble and that he's doing something important. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  He's just – he's not.  He's just a piece of shit.  And I think people are catching on to that, but I have no idea what it is.  But now he's going to come out and speak up on this subject?  The guy should crawl in a fucking hole when subjects like this come up because he's one of the biggest perpetrators.  Fucking asshole.  Oh, and like Jimmy said, he helped establish the entire culture.  He took it to a whole new intimate, personal level. 
[02:06:30]  You know, it was always in magazines like People and things like that.  But he just really made it much more personal and vicious.  Right.  Who was the bra that was peeped on through the hotel room?  GruffBSPN.  I forgot a name all of a sudden.  Aaron Andrews?  Yeah.  Aaron Andrews.  I'm sure he posted those photos all over his site, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm sure you guys did too, but at least you know who you are.  And, you know, Perez can't play it both ways is the point we're making today. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, you're right, dude.  You know, if you're posting these pictures that shouldn't be out there to begin with  and then turn around and you're all about stopping cyberbullying, it doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's more than happy to call, you know, to call people fags.  But if you say the same thing to him, he's outraged.  Right.  And if you have pride in your sexuality, why would you call, like, other guys fags? 
[02:07:30]  Wouldn't that be a...  Well, gay guys do that.  Yeah, but what is that about?  Gay, queer, hey, fag, sweetie, sister, girls, ladies, I guess.  Well...  How about when Perez posted those leaked Clay Aiken photos of his, like, shirtless webcam flirtiness  that was happening?  Yeah, look at what he's doing online.  Did he do that?  Did Perez Hilton do that?  Oh, yes, yeah.  I'm sure Clay Aiken didn't really want that out there.  So I guess that's acceptable.  So what are you talking about, Perez Hilton?  And that came from the internet.  The fuck are you talking about?  Since you know how hard it is to be gay, and you know how devastating it is to have that 
[02:08:00]  outed, you motherfucker.  Why are you trying to...  Because they're celebrities, they can't commit suicide?  Right.  What happened if that humiliated Clay Aiken and he killed himself?  He could have very easily...  Would you have taken the hit for that?  Jumped off a bridge or something because of that?  I just posted the picture of somebody else.  He put them up online.  Fucking hypocrite.  Yeah, where's all the respect and love for transgendered or gay people's privacy?  Since you know how hard it is to be in that situation, you're saying that since you came  out, they should live the same kind of life you should, they should have the same 
[02:08:30]  comfort level you should?  Don't you think Clay Aiken would have been upset to see his womanly tits on a line like that?  He really has an awful...  I thought, I know I have awful tits, but he has abs and man tits.  I don't know how you do that.  That's a little weird.  That's a weird combo.  Wow.  Brendan's gone.  Did Brendan leave?  Maybe his phone fucked up.  Okay.  All right, let's get back to the Perez Hilton video block.  This is amazing stuff.  My God.  But most everything in life will get better because you'll be older, you'll be wiser, you'll 
[02:09:00]  have experience, and if you're in a really unpleasant situation in a year, in two  years, in three years, in a few years, you'll be out of there.  I know it may seem like a lot of time now, but when you start to get older and you're  32 like myself, a year, two years, three years is not that long.  I remember when I was 15...  Oh, God.  Here we go.  ...and gay...  I had a dick in my mouth and I was...  I was so closeted.  I went to an all-boy Jesuit school in Miami. 
[02:09:30]  Hot.  ...and I remember once, vividly, in theology class, a.k.a. religion...  Getting a boner?  My teacher said, you know, there are studies that say that 10% of everybody is gay.  And I was like, wow, that's a really revolutionary thought for a Christian school for a Catholic  teacher.  And then she had to, of course, add on to that by saying, but you boys are not like everybody 
[02:10:00]  else.  So I don't think that 10% of you are gay.  Your percentage is way less.  Maybe it's 1%.  And actually, the percentage was way more than 10.  Oh, really?  But high school wasn't the easiest of times for me.  And I think one of the reasons...  Is this a soliloquy?  Listen to him rambling about it.  He's not talking about cyberbullying, though.  No.  He's talking about being gay.  It's me being gay.  I get it. 
[02:10:30]  And I think one of the reasons for that also was I didn't have that many people to look  up to.  I didn't have role models, good, bad, or any kind of models on television.  I remember the only gay person I saw on TV when I was young was Pedro Zamora on The Real  World.  Now, I love that we have a whole gamut of people, from Neil Patrick Harris, who is amazing,  to myself, whom a lot of people hate. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you.  Oh, boy.  You corn boy.  You corn boy.  Oh, boy.  Once again, we refer to his website.  It runs the whole gamut.  With the cum bubbles and the cocks.  From Neil Patrick Harris to, yeah, the guy that draws cum bubbles on people's mouths.  Great job, great service for gay people, drawing cum on people's faces and dicks in their faces  as a form of insult and humiliation.  Real service to the gay community, you phony motherfucker. 
[02:11:30]  What a...  Ridiculous.  Way to stand tall.  Myself, whom a lot of people hate and find annoying, but I would have loved to have had  me around when I was a teenager.  Why?  You would have outed you, you fucker.  You would have outed you and humiliated you.  Right.  You would have been the first one.  I bet he'd have gone back and sucked his own dick, though.  That's what he means.  Like, back to the future.  You could go back, suck your own cock.  Because I would have either looked at Perez Hilton and found him extremely annoying or 
[02:12:00]  thought he was really cool, but loved the fact that Perez Hilton was able to create something  from nothing.  Can I please pause?  Here's what...  Oh my God, is he deluded.  What you should say is I would look at Perez Hilton and realize that our country is indeed  moving into a fact, a place where nothing in your private life is sacred.  Yeah.  And it is okay to humiliate you for being who you are. 
[02:12:30]  Because that's what you do, scumbag.  Because vultures like Perez Hilton are out there.  You vulture.  You humiliate people because of how they look or what they're doing or who they...  You make your living humiliating people.  And then you wonder, why would somebody humiliate somebody else?  You are a despicable, phony motherfucker.  He could be the number one cyber bully out there.  I mean, how many hits does this dumb website get?  He wishes...  Millions and millions a week, easily.  Wishes he was there for him. 
[02:13:00]  He's...  Yeah.  Really?  He's a big part of the problem.  So you could out yourself.  So you wish...  He wishes Perez Hilton was there for him so when he was 15 he could go online and feel  better about feeling humiliated by seeing other people publicly humiliated.  Yeah.  Shut your face.  This guy is such a...  Shut up, dick.  He ate something from nothing and become successful and not have to be something he's not.  Perez Hilton is very gay and proud of it. 
[02:13:30]  So what?  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  So what?  Does that have to do with you being a scumbag and a vulture?  Yeah, we don't give a shit about that part of it.  I don't care who you fuck.  You're a vulture.  Right.  We have a problem with you being a vulture.  And what did you create?  The name is not even yours.  Hilton you took from Paris Hilton.  You just take everybody else's personal life.  What did you create from nothing?  What did you create?  Invasion of privacy he created.  You're a poster of pictures and stories and rumors and innuendo.  I could give a shit if your dick smells like fucking duty. 
[02:14:00]  So you should be proud of who you are because it's not a choice to be who you are.  You were made this way.  As Lady Gaga says, you were born this way.  So if you're having a hard time, talk to someone.  Shut up, bitch.  Talk to a friend.  Bitch.  Talk to your parents if you can.  No, you can't.  Talk to a stranger.  Call a hotline.  Just don't talk to Perez Hilton because he'll print it. 
[02:14:30]  Talk about your feelings.  Because suicide is never the solution to difficult times.  I have been there.  I went through a point in my life where I was suicidal daily.  I was so depressed and miserable.  What a shame that he didn't do it.  That would have been a nice solution.  What a fucking pleasure that would have been for all the people that he makes miserable on a daily fucking basis.  You fucking come here and do asshole.  So depressed and miserable, hating life. 
[02:15:00]  I felt like I was in a black tunnel.  And I saw no light.  Black tunnel.  Black tunnel.  What's that all about?  Now we're talking.  Now we're getting sexy.  Now we're getting sexy here.  Come on.  Wow.  Black tunnel.  Trying to pull out the gerbil.  Open it up.  Yeah.  And I saw no light at the end of it.  Oh, wow.  I was thinking daily how I would kill myself.  Today I'm going to slip my wrist.  Today I'm going to hang myself.  Today I'm going to jump off my building. 
[02:15:30]  I'm going to go to Oregon and find a horse.  Time.  Over the course of time, my problem got better.  Things changed.  I got fired from that job that I hated.  And it was a blessing.  So things that you may be experiencing now that you think are bad, in hindsight, in the  future, may turn out to be some of the best things that ever happened to you.  So also, and in closing, email me.  Closing.  My email is Perez at PerezHilton.com. 
[02:16:00]  Nice plug.  If you need somebody to talk to, if you want advice, if you're having a hard time, I am here.  Listen, gay kids, don't fucking email Perez Hilton.  He's there for you.  Somehow it'll be on his website.  Yep.  He'll expose you for being gay in some fucked up way.  How about this?  That's our message to the gay kids.  Don't fucking email Perez Hilton.  He can't be trusted.  If a celebrity, okay.  If your secret or your photos.  How about, let's just say a conservative celebrity.  Right.  Let's say someone who he doesn't like emailed him and said, look, I'm a homosexual or I'm 
[02:16:30]  a lesbian.  And I, that motherfucker, you know he would find a way to embarrass them on the website  and get himself some, what a, what a jizz bucket.  If you want advice, if you're having a hard time, I am here for you.  Okay.  So know that you are special and you are loved and you're 15, younger or older and your life  and your spirit is of great value. 
[02:17:00]  Bye.  Hey, you know what?  This is good.  Perez Hilton.  I don't, I don't want to give out his, uh, his Twitter name, but this guy just writes,  trust me, gays hate him too.  Oh God.  That's good to know.  Yes.  I still have your, your number so I can text you.  What a fucking phony hypocrite.  And someone on, on, uh, instant feedback, fair enough.  Fair enough.  Brian in Alabama.  What?  Uh, he's in the same league as Perez.  Brendan said, he said that he goes, look, I'm a dirt bag. 
[02:17:30]  I know it or whatever.  Oh yeah.  He's not trying to be something he's not, which is the problem is Perez is, he's trying  to play it both ways.  And that's why we have a problem from what would Tyler Durden do is not on fucking, he's not  speaking out about cyber bullying, right?  Cyber bullying and gayness.  We're dirt bags when it comes to this type of thing.  Of course we are.  Well, we, we throw a lot of fucking intelligence at you too, as far as the topic goes.  A lot, a little.  A lot.  I say a lot.  This is way more honest than what fucking Perez just said.  I say a speck.  A bird shit about, but we're not being self-righteous about it. 
[02:18:00]  That's what fucking knows.  I would never, I believe me, I know a lot of stuff about people's personal lives that  I would never say on the radio or on stage.  I just wouldn't do it.  Thank you, by the way, Jimmy.  Nah, everybody already knows.  Believe me, that fucking, the black guys.  Oh, the house.  If I had a photo of you with a black dick in your mouth, I couldn't not put it out.  Oh, off of that.  It would be great on every.  A reputation.  Well, not in my eyes. 
[02:18:30]  All right, we got to make a wee wee.  Yes, we do.  Let's go make wee wee.  Let's go make wet.  When we get back, that's right, it's time for Jocktober.  Yes.  We look at Pittsburgh today.  Stay there.  The virus, the serious exer, the O.P. and Anthony show.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, when you call my name.  I'm the man at the Pavlov's door.  Yeah, when you name me, I am. 
[02:19:00]  From heart to beat a ladder, down to beat man.  I know why Travis is playing this.  Happy birthday to Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon.  Well, why the fuck would he play this?  59 years old.  But why would he?  I don't.  We're Sam. 
[02:19:30]  It's time for Jocktober.  Jocktober, everybody.  Jocktober.  I want to know what we're featuring, who they are, where they're from, what type of show  it is.  Is it music?  Is it music and talk?  Is it just talk?  Is there a whole?  There's so many questions.  So many unanswered questions.  Well, first, we've got to play this, though.  We've got to set the whole thing up professionally.  It's Jocktober. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of crap-tastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Hey!  Come on, guys.  Thank you!  To turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God!  I can't believe it!  It's Jocktober.  Sam, what have we got today, brother?  I love the way the music bed keeps going after the intro now.  Just like a, you know, Jocktober kind of show.  Yeah, it's seamless, man. 
[02:20:30]  This is great.  Well, today, we go back to the East Coast.  Not too far East, though.  East Coast.  And we stay in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Ah!  That's West of here.  Well, it's West of here, but it's not really East Coast.  It's not considered East Coast.  It's really not much East of where we were yesterday.  That's not considered by a little bit.  Maybe by a little bit.  We were in the East Coast.  East Coast is Boston.  We were in San Diego yesterday.  New York.  It's definitely East of San Diego.  Delaware.  We traveled in an Eastern direction.  We were in Evansville, Indiana. 
[02:21:00]  Or Indianapolis.  Is it Indianapolis?  No, Indiana is the state.  And Indianapolis is?  And then Evansville is the city, and then Indianapolis is in Indiana.  But we weren't in Indianapolis.  So, now what?  It's not the East Coast.  All right, we're still East-tern.  I guess that was Midwest.  Right.  But Pittsburgh's not considered East Coast, is it?  We're Eastern.  It's East.  East.  East of what?  I wouldn't consider it.  Indiana.  We see a map.  We're really confused.  It's East of everything West of it.  I want to waste all our Jocktober time discussing this, Sam. 
[02:21:30]  Yes, where it is.  Well, it's Pittsburgh is where the city is.  All right, Danny's on it on Google Maps.  But that doesn't mean we're back on the East Coast.  We never really left the East Coast, Sam.  We were in Indiana.  Let's zoom out.  Look how far you've got to zoom for the East Coast.  Get out of here.  Look at this.  Keep zooming.  Dude, Pittsburgh is nowhere near the East Coast.  It's near fucking Ohio.  But look at where Indiana is.  It's just East of Indiana.  It's almost Central Mountain Time.  It's not in the East Coast. 
[02:22:00]  Boston, Rhode Island.  Right.  Fucking Ohio.  What are some of those other East Coast cities?  New York City, Delaware.  But it is Florida.  Virginia Beach.  Not Iowa.  It's directly East of Indiana.  Jacksonville.  May, Portland.  Right.  We're just naming places, right?  Fucking, I, I, I, I.  Canada.  You're just a liar, Sam.  The hat store.  Denver.  Denver?  Well. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, now we've got the Pittsburgh people screaming, saying they are part of the Northeast.  Oh, you're not.  They're not part of the Northeast.  Just stop it.  You're not.  You're not.  You're not.  They're part of the 20th century, you fucking coal miners.  21st century.  If you can't drive to the water within a couple hours, you're not East Coast.  Yeah, if you can't get in your, like, swim trunks, get in your car and be at the beach  in, like, an hour and a half.  Hour and a half, two hours.  I'll even give you two hours.  That's crazy.  I'll give you two hours.  I'll give you the two hours. 
[02:23:00]  And we don't mean a Great Lake, motherfucker.  That's right.  We mean the ocean.  That's right.  The ocean.  Pittsburgh, not East Coast, Sam.  But it's Eastern from Indiana.  We were in Indiana yesterday.  It's not barely.  It's obviously Eastern.  It's barely East.  It's fucking West of, let's see, Philly, Maryland, Jersey, Delaware.  We were in Indiana yesterday.  Binghamton, fucking Allentown.  It's almost West of West Virginia.  That proves my point. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  It's not called East Coast Virginia.  That's right.  It's not called East Virginia, Sam.  You're crazy with this.  Don't even argue the point.  Don't fuck with us.  Is this small talk?  Puffy-haired...  No, this ain't small talk.  This is cyberbullying.  Geography-challenged fuck dick.  Stop cyberbullying me.  Yeah, we are cyberbullying.  We got a computer picture up, and we're yelling at you.  Why haven't we gotten E-Rock's perspective on cyberbullying yet?  He probably feels very sensitive about it.  He bullies his shoes by putting weight into them.  I know he deletes people off Facebook, so obviously he gets cyberbullied. 
[02:24:00]  He's on fat Facebook.  I'm sorry.  I love that Facebook.  Anyway, we're going to Pittsburgh today.  Are you?  Yes.  No, we.  Together.  Isn't that the East Coast?  It's Eastern.  It's not quite the East Coast.  I thought it was East Coast.  No, not really.  Oh, right.  But we head to 96.1 Kiss FM for the Freak Show.  Kiss.  The Morning Freak Show with Big Bob and Mikey.  Who are they?  Big Bob and Mikey.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  They call themselves the Freak Show, so they're doing some freaky shit.  It's got to be crazy.  What's some of the freaky shit they do, Sam?  Well, they're in their minds crazy.  What they'll do is they'll place the hits.  Do they say they're on the East Coast?  No.  Is that how lunatic they are?  No.  Not that crazy.  Oh, that is wild.  My belly button is not good today.  Oh, does it stink?  Oh, boy.  It's not good.  Oh, Sam, give it a sniff.  Iraq doesn't believe you.  Who do we got here today?  Sam, give it a sniff.  Troy, he was, I mean, Troy's never smelled it.  Troy's a trooper.  I say Iraq.  Okay, get Iraq.  We want someone that's going to go down. 
[02:25:00]  Iraq!  Here he comes.  Is he still limping from his big infection on his leg?  No, no, no.  Look at him.  Let me see.  Let's look at his walk.  Ah, yeah.  Here he comes.  He's walking to the music.  He always is.  It's in his head all the time.  Yeah.  I guess that infected leg is better, huh?  Hi, Iraq.  My belly button is bad today.  Hold on, hold on.  What's your perspective on cyberbullying? 
[02:25:30]  Well, I'm obviously not for it.  Oh.  But I haven't had much cyberbullying.  I've had regular bullying.  Oh, you got bullied?  Twice.  I don't know.  Smell that.  Oh, my.  I had to.  The smell is in the middle.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  It smells like a diaper hamper.  Oh, wow.  It's like fermenting shit.  Oh.  Thank you.  What do you have in your belly button that smells so bad? 
[02:26:00]  The load I blew into it last night.  Why don't you clean out your belly button?  Why would you?  Your belly button's like a cum sump.  Dude.  Why don't you just clean it?  I'm busy.  Yeah.  I'm playing jacks.  After I wipe gum off myself, I play jacks for an hour.  Onesies.  Twosies.  You don't go into the bathroom and take a washcloth and wipe down.  No.  Squeeze the little last bit out.  No.  Then rub down your belly button and belly area. 
[02:26:30]  No.  No.  You just let it crust over.  Potato flakes.  Potato flakes.  It smells like potato shoes.  Potato shoes.  Potato shoes.  Hey.  Remember yesterday we were doing this Jacktober?  Thanks, Iraq.  That was a bust.  Ryan, what's going on?  Just like the floor when he walks on it.  Oh, because you're fat.  Oh, Iraq.  We just want to prove that cyberbullying doesn't cause everyone to commit suicide.  Oh, my God.  He just shot himself. 
[02:27:00]  He did?  Yeah.  He should have.  Hey, Ryan, what do you got?  Elephant gun.  That Adam Smasher and Sandra show from yesterday.  Yeah.  We were talking about y'all this morning.  I don't know what was going on.  I'm in Missouri right now.  I dropped a drug.  Yeah.  But I just know their call strainer was going on, and she didn't sound too happy about y'all's comments yesterday.  Which one?  I think Adam Smasher didn't mind our take on him, because we think he should be doing a better show, 
[02:27:30]  and we think the hole is once again holding back a radio show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went online and saw her, like, mowing her lawn.  Really?  Yeah, my wife said the same thing.  She can't stand them.  Yeah, so I would imagine Atom Smasher is fine with what we had to say, but the woman is not, because she's in that hole category.  The hole.  We did bring up that Atom Smasher lacked a sense of humor that's also needed for a good radio show.  Yeah, he's not a funny guy.  Yeah, he just didn't seem very funny, even though he wanted to be funnier. 
[02:28:00]  But he could be doing some other things with his show.  Maybe.  If she wasn't in the way.  Maybe.  All right, thank you, Ryan.  I appreciate that.  Oh, you're welcome.  All right, today we look at the Morning Freak Show with Big Bob and Mikey on Kiss 96.1 in Pittsburgh.  You could tell Atom Smasher, you could talk about whatever he wants today.  Jocktober comes and goes.  Yeah.  They're yesterday's news.  Today's news is the Morning Freak Show with Big Boy and Mikey.  Big Boy and Mikey.  Well, Big Bob and Mikey.  Or Big Bob, not Big Boy.  Big Bob and Mikey make noises and think they're funny. 
[02:28:30]  That's right.  Big Bob and Mikey make noises and think they're funny and think they're funny and think they're  funny.  Do that in school today, kids.  When it's real quiet and the teacher's teaching, it's going, ah, and see what happens. 
[02:29:00]  I'll do that.  It's a good piece of advice for the kids.  Why not?  Just do it.  It's hilarious.  Come on, kids.  At least they're filling their time well between songs.  What kind of music do they play?  They play the hits.  Another.  Oh, nothing but the hits.  A lot of things are playing the hits.  Yeah.  Try it, people. 
[02:29:30]  Try it.  It really is fun.  Imagine if a teacher heard you doing that.  Imagine that, Sam.  That would be just insane.  It would be freaky.  That's why they call them the freak show.  It is freaky.  Yeah.  What else goes on on this show?  Oh, boy.  You don't want to know.  I know.  The two grown men talk about dancing with the stars as if they're stay-at-home moms.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Well, you know how you guys every now and then will bring up something going on in pop culture?  Yeah.  And then we kind of beat the shit out of it. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Jamie is from Pittsburgh.  He's on line three.  Yeah.  And he's got a little information that I wasn't aware of.  Oh, shit.  At the morning freak show with Big Bob and Mikey?  Jamie, Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  What's up, Jamie?  What's the scoop?  I kind of know Mikey and Bob, and they are huge O&A fans.  Oh, no.  That means this is going to hurt a little more.  A little sting.  This is going to sting, boys.  We always go together to see Norton when he comes to the show.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:30]  Norton's probably done their show.  I didn't say anything about them.  I didn't.  Hey, I'm not out of this fucking deal.  They might get their feelings hurt then in that case.  That's a shame.  Look, it has nothing to do with them.  How about this?  It's business.  Let's do this segment then.  Before we continue, let's make this segment where we're going to help a show, fix what might  be, what might make it a better show.  There's a good angle.  We're not going to make fun of these guys.  We're going to try to help and make the show better. 
[02:31:00]  Fuck that.  Why would we be like Perez Hilton and just bash when we can help people?  When we can lift people up?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's what the spirit of Jocktober is anyway.  It really is.  When you point out, we're just, we're like consultants.  Yeah.  For free.  Well, guys.  You're welcome.  At Tom Smasher.  Oh, no.  Thank you for whoever tweeted this to me.  He blogged about us.  Oh.  What did he say?  At Tom Smasher.  Any advertising is good advertising. 
[02:31:30]  Incorrect.  That's good.  Thanks to the Opie and Anthony show for verbally abusing our show on the air this morning.  Oh, no.  For those who don't know, they used to be in radio and now are on satellite.  Yes.  Good one.  We can't be mad at him for hitting back.  What's he going to say?  We did an hour.  We humiliated him.  We did humiliate him.  He makes one little line and we're like, what the fuck?  Another guy that doesn't want to acknowledge satellite radio?  Sure he does.  I mean.  He would like to.  We used to be in radio.  I know. 
[02:32:00]  Most people would say we have over a million listeners.  I think it's more than that.  But let's say, safe to say, a million listeners.  I don't think Atom Smasher is talking to a million fucking listeners.  It's like when you used to be in high school and then you move on to college.  Right.  Like he's still in radio.  We've moved on.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have thick skin and I know it's their shtick, so I'm not offended.  They have people nominate morning shows from around the country for Opie and Anthony to rip to shreds on the air. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, that's the good.  By the way, it's our listeners that are really pointing out the really bad shows.  Oh, yeah.  By the way.  So if you're featured on this show, you're really bad.  The listeners are pointing you out.  Right, because we don't know these radio shows anymore.  I know a few out there.  Every show that we've featured so far has been nominated by a listener of the Opie and Anthony show.  More than one, though, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Doesn't it take more than a few listeners to bring it to your attention?  Of course.  I'm not just going to click every email.  There's thousands of them.  They think every radio show is lame and hacky. 
[02:33:00]  For the most part, I do believe that.  There's a handful.  Yeah.  But we give them a good listen first.  So whoever nominated us, thanks.  From what I hear, they were more rough on Shonda.  Well, that's true.  Well, certainly is true.  Than me.  But that's not surprising.  They always rip the chick more.  Yes.  We do.  Atom, stop.  You know you don't want to be doing radio with a fucking hole.  Why don't you be honest with that?  Adam, you know that every time. 
[02:33:30]  Atom.  Atom, you go into something, and how many times have you been ready to talk?  And she goes, oh, that's not nice.  Now.  And you wonder what it would feel like to cave her fat cheek in with your fist.  Right.  Or throw your coffee on her.  Shut up.  I'm talking.  I'm a man.  Here's the facts.  Most guys in radio that are doing morning radio don't want to do it with a woman.  There's a few maybe like light FM type shit.  No way.  But most of them do not want to be doing radio with a woman. 
[02:34:00]  But they're told to do it with a woman.  They've got to get that unique perspective in there.  Correct the mundo.  But if it was up to Atom Smasher, he would not be doing radio with a woman.  He'd be smashing Atoms by his male self.  Right.  Uh, no surprise, they always rip the chick more.  Some guy said he'd send me the audio.  I'll post it when I get it.  I won't.  Excuse me, that audio is property of Sirius XM.  Buster.  I won't lie.  Wow, legal, legal, Sam. 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  I won't lie, it does sting a little when you're on the receding end of an Opie and Anthony verbal beatdown.  Oh, he got his feelings hurt.  See, he knows all about us.  So even that dumb shot, we cyberbullied.  We're not on radio anymore, we're on satellite.  I'm sorry.  Calm down.  But I guess I should feel privileged.  End of this blog from Atom Smasher.  And then we have FS Big Bob over here.  Big Bob! 
[02:35:00]  To Opie and also to Jim Norton.  He goes, make sure you boys play our XM202 Suck My Sea jingle.  We made for you boys a few years back.  It was actually a good jingle.  In the review of our show this morning.  Oh, you know we can't go after these cuts.  Oh my God.  No way.  This is them.  We love this.  We love this.  And Norton too.  Good times.  Great hits.  XM202.  Suck My Buggy Cock. 
[02:35:30]  Is that the show that you got?  That's these guys?  I guess so.  God.  We can't do this.  I don't know, but how do we bash them?  That's what he's claiming.  That's what he's saying.  How do we bash them with that fucking...  We can't do this, Sam.  Sam, what's wrong with you?  That jingle rules, but their show does not.  Do you have a...  Oh, fuck.  Sam is saying the show does not.  It does not rule.  Like the jingle goes.  We're in a quandary, man.  I don't feel good about it.  Do you have another show standing by?  No.  Let me tell you something, Sam.  Let me tell you something else.  The sounds that they were making.  Yeah.  Now, I'm going to equate that a little bit to our own Jimmy Norton. 
[02:36:00]  No.  Who will occasionally just go...  No, I don't do that.  I go like this.  Yours sounded stupid.  Mine, it goes...  Oh, yeah.  Meh.  Meh.  Or this is a good...  Meh.  Meh.  See?  Okay.  We make sounds, too.  We do.  So that kind of came off as like...  That wasn't...  Wasn't that bad?  It was out of context.  Okay.  Maybe these guys are fine. 
[02:36:30]  And the fucking suck my fucking cock jingle...  Yeah, they did the suck my cock jingle.  How long do we play that?  Two hours.  We played it for fucking...  For months, maybe years.  Because we used...  Sam.  Suck my fucking cock?  We laughed our balls off at that one.  We can't do it to these guys.  It's not about what goes on outside of their show.  Do they have a hole on their show?  No.  See, they're doing everything right.  No, they're doing...  They're not doing everything right.  They're doing everything right.  They're not.  I'm honestly going to listen to the next segment...  Right.  ...and see if it sucks. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  And I'm really honestly going to listen.  Okay.  Yeah.  With an open mind.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Let's listen.  Because I don't know.  I think Sam fucking tripped on his dick on this one.  Do you think this is a Jocktober po-fah?  A po-fah, as Rich Voss would say.  A po-fah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's give him a listen.  And I'm telling you.  All right.  Let's listen.  All right.  Let's listen.  With an open mind. 
[02:37:30]  Because you guys talk to me.  Completely open.  Because like yesterday.  I'll give you an example.  Yesterday, when the hole kicked in and went, well, it's just...  We knew.  Yes.  We knew immediately bad.  All right.  Now, them making sounds, eh, it wasn't...  Whatever.  Let's take it in context.  Sam, open mind.  Coming out of a song, it's weird to make noises.  If these guys are doing shitty radio, we will certainly call them out.  Yes.  We have to.  Yes.  Even though they did the suck my fucking cock jingle.  Let's be honest.  I'm confident in my song.  All right.  There we go. 
[02:38:00]  Dancing with the Stars last night.  You watch, Bob?  Yeah.  All we really care about this year on Dancing with the Stars, there was two people we cared  about going into this season.  David Hasselhoff voted off the first week.  Hasselhoff's a goner.  And then the situation from Jersey Shore.  Situation do okay last night?  Or was this better than the first couple weeks?  Yeah, he had like a 20 out of 30.  They all said he was getting better.  You can't fist pump if you don't know the beat, right?  You can't fist pump if you don't know...  Who's not a fan of the situation, Sam?  What's the problem here?  Aren't you?  And Hasselhoff with the hamburgers on the floor. 
[02:38:30]  And they're making a joke about the fist pump.  Right.  But they're not making any jokes.  No, this is fine.  And then they repeat what he says in the clip, which means they're being sarcastic.  Right.  Don't you understand?  I guess maybe the sarcasm is lost on me.  I'm usually pretty good.  Play that clip.  Play that clip where he says...  Where he says...  I mean, he seems like they're just talking about it, not making any jokes.  No, listen when he says...  This is a well-structured radio break right here, Sam.  Listen when he talks about...  You can learn from these guys.  I mean, I'm young in the game. 
[02:39:00]  You can learn from these guys.  The first couple weeks, they're like a 20 out of 30.  They all said he was getting better.  You can't fist pump if you don't know the beat, right?  You can't fist pump if you don't know the beat.  I think that's a little life lesson for everybody today.  That's sarcasm, you dummy.  This week is the story week.  The story line that Queen has come up with, I believe, which has to do with some sort of time machine.  Oh, good Lord.  What the hell did they do last night?  They do like a costume show, like dance, you know.  It's always some type of like performance.  And they have like smoke in a time machine.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, no.  This is I'm going to be a scientist with glasses and a white robe.  Glasses?  Glasses is a good look.  Oh, what are you doing?  You're making, yeah, exactly.  Is the Jersey Shore perv switch one on there?  For everything they show.  You just don't perv switch from you, by the way.  It's like nothing sexy.  No, he's just a perv like the entire time.  I wonder how much stuff actually gets cut out of their rehearsals because he just completely  pervs out at her.  They're going to laugh about this week and really, you know, put in the work to avoid any  elimination situation, you know.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[02:40:00]  He loves the catchphrase.  Ties it in.  He loves the catchphrase.  You've got to respect him for always working in this situation and everything.  You know, we want to avoid any, you know, elimination situations.  Yeah, that's the word because that's your name.  Oh, we love it.  Perfect radio break right there.  I couldn't agree more, Sam.  That was a perfect radio break.  I couldn't agree more.  They're using their own voices.  They're talking about pop culture.  They're making some jokes. 
[02:40:30]  Pop culture, sarcasm, goofing on what they were talking about.  They weren't goofing on.  They just said they respected the situation.  They sound like a bunch of guys having fun on the radio, Sam.  I'm your foil, though.  You didn't pick up the sarcasm.  I didn't think they were being terribly sarcastic.  When they played a clip of the situation talking, and then he repeats it like this and like  that, and then goes like, words to live by, you know, words of wisdom, whatever he said. 
[02:41:00]  You don't think that's sarcasm?  I didn't think that.  He said you've got to respect the situation doing this.  But he didn't mean you've got to respect it.  He meant the situation's a douche.  You are, that was a well-structured, put-together quick break.  It sure was.  I think he was, Anthony.  Big Bob was doing a fake radio voice.  It did sound a little like this.  Not really.  They were kind of excited and everything.  It might be the processing on the radio station.  It was upbeat.  It was fucking energetic.  Not as bad as some of the voices I've heard on Hits 1. 
[02:41:30]  Exactly.  Well, I mean, we could talk about it.  My Twitter.  Have you heard any?  Do we have any examples of any of the bad radio voices on Hits 1?  Maybe we should do that for Jocktober.  Can you play him out of private?  Play that shit.  I mean, it seems a little indulgent to play my own breaks for Jocktober.  What's better than smashing this fine radio show that seems to be doing things properly?  I didn't think so at all.  We're fucking, what, three days into Jocktober, and you fucking already are picking on shows that are actually good? 
[02:42:00]  I didn't think that was a good show.  They didn't have any jokes.  They were just talking about Dancing with the Stars.  You know what?  Silly me.  It's kind of a talent to be able to just talk about something, make it entertaining, without having to have a zinger.  Yeah, very natural.  Oh, wow.  It wasn't natural.  Let me tell you.  Very natural.  And it's got to end like, but it was like, it doesn't have to be, hey, we're done.  Go to break. 
[02:42:30]  Two women talking about Dancing with the Stars.  They're grown men.  It wasn't.  They were being, they were mocking it.  Mocking it.  I didn't get that.  You didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  Well, that's your fucking mistake.  Well, Anthony, why don't we move on?  And they do their bit, which I still don't understand.  This is Sam writing, of course.  Well, I don't get it.  The Office Monkeys.  Why don't you get this bit they do?  Office Monkeys.  The Morning Freak Show with Big Bob and Mikey on Kiss 96.1 in Pittsburgh.  To their credit, I did shorten this because it was very long.  Why would you shorten their bit? 
[02:43:00]  Because it was long.  You don't want to hear the whole thing.  If it's a good bit, you don't care.  But it's not a good bit.  But if it's just discussion, then it is.  But this is not discussion.  It's the Office Monkeys where they will be the judge.  We certainly will, Anthony.  Okay, I think he explains it in the clip.  There's something set up for it.  Oh, good.  He actually explains it.  You're looking at a couple honest abes right now, Sam.  Oh, that sucks, Sam.  We will be the judges.  I always thought so.  This is for people who work in offices and stuff like that.  That's not funny. 
[02:43:30]  What?  There's nothing funny about that.  There's nothing funny about him saying this is for people who work in offices.  No, because I know where he's going with this.  Where?  He's relating to office people.  You know what office monkeys are?  Well, I don't know.  It's for people who work in offices and stuff like that.  We have these characters, Barb, Mary, and Hank the Mailman.  And what we do is me and Bob get on this computer program and just type back and forth as Barb and Mary and Hank.  So, ladies and gentlemen, a welcome back Big Ben edition of the Office Monkeys here on the Kids Morning Free Show. 
[02:44:00]  All right, good.  Keeping it local.  Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger.  Start to see it our way.  Good.  Yeah, I talk about them in my act, Roethlisberger.  Yeah, I'm first here.  That's fake typing sentence.  Good morning, Barb.  Are you excited for the welcome back Big Ben party in the break room today?  Finally, after four games, our sexy football cowboy is ready to sling it.  I had a dream last night that I was a cowboy and Big Ben was my horse.  Big Ben had beautiful, long, flowing horse hair.  When I woke up, I was sweaty and was chewing on my blanket. 
[02:44:30]  That's some fine writing right there.  It's not fine writing.  You just made it up.  And so what if they use fake typewriters now?  We use fake car crashes, fake shotguns.  What do you think this is?  It's a radio show.  Yeah, they didn't actually bring a car in and crash it.  All right.  Yeah, sorry.  That's a $35,000 joke.  Get out of here.  Great.  But you don't actually make it seem like there are cars in the studio crashing into each other.  I think the writing is right on.  He just said, I'm typing now.  Yeah, okay.  It's okay.  It's called putting a fucking visual in the listener's head. 
[02:45:00]  But it's not leading anything.  You're painting the picture for the listener.  Spit doesn't have a point, though.  This morning, Freak Show, Office Monkeys, welcome back to Big Ben edition here.  To show my support for Big Ben, I am wearing something I have not worn since Ben's rookie year.  I am wearing my Tommy Maddox Stealer jersey today at the Big Ben welcome back party.  It is not really a jersey anymore since I had my Tommy Maddox jersey made into a pair of Stealer panties.  Even though I cheer for Ben now, good old number eight Tommy Maddox will always hold a special place right near my crotch. 
[02:45:30]  Go see her.  I understand the joke, but it's not funny.  Yeah, it is.  It's edgy.  It's a fucking...  They're goofing on Ben.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is talking about good old Ben.  They're doing fake laughs after it.  No, they're not.  You can hear the fake laughs.  We know a fake laugh when we hear it, Sam.  No, yesterday was a fake laugh.  That's right.  I don't even understand why that was done in a computer voice.  Why was that done in a computer voice?  You dropped the ball on this one. 
[02:46:00]  Why is your voice getting higher?  You're panicking.  I don't understand.  You're panicking.  Why would they do that in a computer voice?  How does that make any sense?  We might have to give Jocktober to Troy.  I think you're fucking nuts.  Look at what I'm reading.  These guys rule.  Sam sucks.  Sam should be fired.  Fire Sam.  What are you talking about?  Sam is falling apart in the air.  Who thinks these guys rule?  Sam's delivery is jealous.  I'm not jealous of anyone.  Sam sucks.  Sam lost his edge.  Sam equal sign shit.  What?  Sam's a faggot.  Sam's a douche.  Sam's a douche.  Sam's a douche.  Sam's a bitch.  Sam's a bitch.  Sam's a faggot. 
[02:46:30]  Kill Sam.  Don't do it.  Sam is a boring douche.  I'm not.  F Sam.  He should die.  No.  Did you get the one, Sam sucks cock?  It's crazy.  No, he didn't say that, but I disagree.  Sam sucks cock.  Sam should be banned from any Jocktober bit.  Listen.  Sam needs to take Radio 101.  They kill Sam's Jocktober.  They want to rename...  Go back to Special Delivery.  They want to rename Jocktober Samtober.  Samtober.  This is my third year of Jocktober.  Yeah, I think you're getting a little lazy.  Sam's a cyber bully. 
[02:47:00]  How can I be this far off the mark?  I don't understand this.  I still stand by...  Sam is a faggot who should die of ass AIDS.  That seems a little harsh because of one...  You screwed up.  A lot of people think it's time for you to kill yourself.  I'm not going to.  For the show.  I won't.  For the show.  For the show.  Sam Perez Hilton.  Somebody's calling me on my cell phone.  I don't even know who that is.  Hopefully it's fucking one of the bosses.  Yeah, fire in your ass.  Sam blew it.  Don't say that, Danny.  I didn't blow it.  Why was that in a computer voice?  Sam docks with Perez Hilton. 
[02:47:30]  I've never done that.  Die, Sam.  Die.  Bring back Steve C.  Get rid of Sam.  Ryan at Buffalo.  Drown Sam in period blood.  Epic Sam failure.  That would be great for the radio show.  Drowning in period blood.  Drown you in period blood.  There's no way we're going to get that much period blood.  But why was that done in a computer voice?  Huh?  Why was that done in a computer voice?  Sam should be raped by a pack of...  Oh.  Oh.  Don't say that.  Well, it just said it.  I know.  I'm just reading line by line here.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  But that bit didn't make any sense.  How did that just...  Set Sam's hair on fire.  I would love to.  Don't do it.  There's no way that bit made people laugh.  Sam loves black dick.  No, I don't.  Have you tried it?  No.  Sam should shut up and blow me!  Please bring back Steve C.  Yeah.  Steve C.  What?  He never did anything for Jacktober.  And you aren't either.  All right.  Why don't we do another bit?  Blowing it.  From the Morning Freak Show with Big Bob and Mikey.  Okay.  Sam Jack.  We're looking forward to trashing a radio show today.  I don't Jack the Hulk Hogan posters.  So he says.  I'm just reading them. 
[02:48:30]  I've never Jacked any of them.  All right.  Let's read it.  That's not a picture of me.  That's a picture of a man.  They're now calling your show Special Ed Delivery.  That's not cool.  Because you're retarded.  This is bullying.  Because you suck and you're retarded.  No, I don't.  And no, I'm not.  It's Mario Lemieux's birthday.  Now, he's a fucking hero in Pittsburgh.  So how could this be a problem, Sam?  Yeah.  What is this?  Nice local sports break.  God forbid they acknowledge a hero's birthday.  Local sports break.  You mentioned it was somebody's birthday today, right?  You know, you're coming back from break. 
[02:49:00]  You mentioned whose birthday it is.  Do you sing a song about it?  Maybe.  Maybe we should sing.  Yeah, I think you should sing.  Maybe we should.  You never sang a song like Beth, I Hear You Calling or We're Back.  No, they made up a song.  Yes, you think We're Back, I made up.  Well, let's see.  Yeah, but that was funny.  Well, let's see.  It's all subjective.  Well, as we continue with Sam Tober.  It's not Sam Tober, it's Jack Tober.  Let's see what they do with Mario Lemieux's birthday that is so bad that Sam had to bring  it to their attention.  Do we have to say happy birthday to somebody here?  Happy birthday Uncle Mario, man.  And they're acting like they didn't know it was coming. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, we got the freak show on the line, matter of fact.  Oh, okay.  Uh, freak show.  Hi, sirs.  Hi, guys.  We want to apologize from the bottom of our hearts, sir.  Profusely.  Profusely.  Sam's an idiot.  I don't.  I'm not apologizing.  Oh.  No.  Sam's a tough guy.  Sam's a tough guy now.  Telephone tough guy.  I'm not a tough guy.  I'm not a tough guy.  I'm doing my job.  Uh, Sam is supposed to find shows that suck.  Right.  And, uh, we're listening to your stuff and it's like, these guys are good. 
[02:50:00]  What?  We don't understand why he chose your show for Jack Tober.  Freak show.  I got to tell you, we, we're hearing nothing but a perfect radio show so far.  Good breaks.  Sam just got lazy because he thought we were a top 40 morning show and just thought,  oh, they're instantly a morning, you know, wacky zoo and have a wacky joke morning.  Yep.  Yep.  I listened to the whole, I listened to three hours of your show yesterday.  I didn't even know they were the guys that wrote the song for us, the jingle.  They didn't mention that yesterday.  We don't have a girl that sits in the corner and laughs, Sam. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  We're doing an easy target.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, where's the girl, Sam?  Exactly.  They're not an easy target because I don't go for the easy targets.  I go for variety.  I go for true radio applause.  You got lazy and you're just picking shows now.  No, I'm not picking shows.  And you got caught.  Your show was nominated by many virus fans.  By the way, guys, the guy that's making fun of you, Sam Roberts, is wearing a Lady Gaga  t-shirt today.  I'm a fan.  Ugh.  Terrific, Sam.  But I don't have to sing a song about it. 
[02:51:00]  She sings the song.  It's not me.  We got to get a little bit of Sam's does good radio.  Where's a bit of Sam's break?  Yeah, why don't we play a little Sam's radio show?  You want to hear a little Sam?  It's burning right now.  We're getting out.  Sam, what's yours for Sam?  We'll have it in a second.  We're burning it for you.  But Sam does good radio.  We should burn every copy of every friggin' minute that he's ever done.  To CDs.  These guys refuse to do radio with a hole, Sam.  They don't refuse.  They just haven't been told to yet.  If they were told to, they would do it.  Freak show.  Actually, no, Sam. 
[02:51:30]  Actually, there was one day they put a girl in here, and we just made her so uncomfortable  that they just decided not to have a girl.  Yeah, she was uncomfortable because she appreciates funny radio, and your show made her uncomfortable.  Now, mention Pittsburgh.  Keep it local.  What's wrong with going local with the radio?  That's perfect.  That's the only way you defend against satellite radio.  They're in Pittsburgh.  Why wouldn't they be local?  You're not supposed to talk about it.  They're forcing it.  They're singing songs about Mario Lemieux.  These guys grew up in Pittsburgh.  I can tell by their voices, Sam. 
[02:52:00]  They probably didn't.  No, they didn't.  They probably didn't.  They did.  Where did you grow up?  We're actually originally from Detroit.  Detroit.  And now all of a sudden...  Jesus, freak show.  I was trying to help you out.  Put your pirate's hat on.  That's a great setup there.  I was trying to help you guys out.  Exactly.  Put your pirate's hat on and memorize the street maps.  So the first day on the air, you had to have all those fun facts about Pittsburgh in front of you.  So you sounded like you knew what you were talking about, right?  Yeah, we came on and we're just like, hello, yins, pirates, and penguins.  Go, local sports teams. 
[02:52:30]  See, this is funny, Sam.  They're cracking us up.  Yeah, it's funny now because they're being on the cuff.  They're funny, too.  On the radio, they have to actually act like they like these things.  They're singing songs about Mario Lemieux and Bugs.  Oh, like you?  Plugging your fucking...  Or your effing if you're on the air.  Are we on the air down there?  If we are...  Of course we're not on the air.  They don't have the balls to put Opie and Anthony on their show.  No, they're not stupid enough to get fired like that.  Right.  We would have just got them fired, so they made the right choice there, too, Sam.  You are putting on a fake voice when you do your stupid radio show. 
[02:53:00]  My voice is...  No.  We do have fake radio voices.  Does Sam use a fake voice?  Does he use a fake voice?  No.  Sam uses the worst fake voice you would ever hear.  It's been toned down since you originally heard it.  Oh, stop.  We want the older stuff.  The Bernie's still...  The older stuff?  What is it on a Mimeo Grant?  Where the fuck is it?  I don't know.  Yeah, what are you doing there?  Andy in Queens wants Sam to be raped by a Lady Gaga CD.  Oh, that would be great.  Would you do that for the show, Sam?  Sideways.  Raped by a CD?  Sideways.  Sideways.  In the case?  Yeah, in the case. 
[02:53:30]  In the jewel case.  You're a mess.  You're getting lazy.  You're just picking shows now without listening.  I listened to three hours of this show before I picked it.  Freak Show, we're very embarrassed today.  I listened to two shows yesterday, and the Freak Show was worse than the other show I listened to.  Yeah, we're all believing that, Sam.  That's terrific.  Who else did you listen to here?  Yeah, what was the other choice?  Yeah, what was the other choice in Pittsburgh, Sam?  It wasn't in Pittsburgh.  It was in Nebraska.  Oh, you're telling me a show in Nebraska, we are worse than them? 
[02:54:00]  That's right.  That's what I'm telling you.  You're worse than them.  At least it was Mario Lemieux's freaking birthday here yesterday.  Yeah.  It was going on in Nebraska.  That was so awesome, Sam.  Your story's become a bit much, Sam.  Why didn't Nebraska make the cut and these guys did, Sam?  That's embarrassing.  The secret to surviving Jocktober is if you have a show that literally does absolutely nothing...  You're safe?  You're safe, because I can't pull clips from that.  There's nothing to talk about. 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  But if you're like the Freak Show, who puts on dumb bits...  As soon as I hear dumb bits and songs, you're in.  You're in.  Dumb bits.  Yes, like the Office Monkeys and the Bed Bugs song or whatever song you want.  I don't know, Sam.  I usually go with you, but I think these guys are good.  You thought Office Monkeys was edgy?  Edgy?  The writing was good?  Sorry they're not plugging their Twitter every break like Sam Roberts does on his dumb show.  I'm sorry we didn't do War of the Roses for you, Sam.  Oh, Sam. 
[02:55:00]  I don't do War of the Roses.  Yeah, you do.  You might as well.  War of the Roses.  We will get a phone scam on for you, Sam.  I don't do those things.  I work for this show.  I don't do those things.  Hold on.  Sam, here we go.  I'm right back at you.  Say, we're in good company, Sam.  I don't understand.  We both have horns.  But I'm not insulted by those things.  Wacky horn for wacky Sam.  You want to do Battle of the Sexes, Sam?  Ah.  I don't have a shirt and honk your breasts, Sam. 
[02:55:30]  I don't have breasts.  Big Bob has breasts, not me.  And the only reason I even know your name is because it's written down in front of me.  You know my name.  And I don't know the fact that you're mad.  You did a standard fat joke, Sam.  They are ripping you apart.  They are ripping me apart.  You know why?  Because they know who I am just off the top of their heads.  I'm going to sit on you.  Oh, terrific.  Yeah, he's going to sit on you, Sam.  They know exactly who I am.  Because he's fat.  They're making fun of you just going after the fat, easy target. 
[02:56:00]  You stink, Sam.  Yeah.  Where's Sam's radio voice?  You got it?  It's coming.  We have to get it out of one system and put it on us.  Oh, well, that makes sense.  Maybe the freak show could review special delivery on their show.  Special delivery?  You can review it.  Oh, that would be great.  I would tell it.  That's a great idea.  Did you just make fat jokes all day, Sam?  No, I made one fat joke.  He's a cyber bully, guys.  He's a cyber bully.  Watch out for Sam Roberts.  He really is.  He really is.  We're going to play one of Sam's breaks for you if you guys have a minute. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe it's good.  I like Sam, so maybe it's a great break.  You're welcome.  It could be an excellent break.  Maybe we'll be fair about it.  I'll bet it will be.  I'll bet they'll go through my show from last night and find the very best break.  No, not last night.  We're going to go...  Don't we have older ones we used to play?  Yeah, we're going to go right to his first show where he was really nervous.  Oh, great.  Perfect.  And then those are the old ones.  Where are the ones we were playing that one time?  You prefer those.  I want you to jump off the George Washington Bridge after this is all over.  You do?  Yes, please.  Well, I'm not, because Big Bob knows my name, and that makes me more famous than him. 
[02:57:00]  You know, if you're a cyberbully, and if you jumped off a bridge, then you could solve  the whole cyberbullying epidemic, Sam.  I'm not going to jump off a bridge.  I think cyberbullying should be stopped.  I'm a big-time cyberbully, and then you jump.  I'm not...  This is uncomfortable.  This isn't going good, Sam.  It's going just fine, thank you.  And I'm going to keep living, because I'm every month, every day...  Don't fool me!  To living.  To living.  Every day this month, I'll be bringing a show.  Oh, sound effect, Sam.  Isn't that bad? 
[02:57:30]  No.  Not in this context.  Oh, here comes E-Rock.  Why run down the hall when these guys have got to go back on the radio any moment?  Look at E-Rock just trotting and plodding down the hallway.  What do you got there, E-Rock?  These were the early ones.  All right.  We're going to listen to some Sam Roberts.  Guys, strap in, by the way.  Strap in, guys.  And I'm doing Sam a...  It's real funny.  I'm doing Sam a favor.  This is from last night's show.  No, I don't think it is from last night's show.  It says it right here, last night's show.  All right.  Well, I mean, if it says it...  Guys, you ready for this?  Yeah, we got the joke horn ready. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  I heard that.  Coming up in the next 20 minutes, Kevin Rudolph.  Adam Lambert.  What do you want from me?  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  And a microphone.  Serious.  XM.  Satellite.  Radio.  Definitely once and last night.  Definitely wasn't last night.  You just said...  You sound like a progeria kid.  I understand, but it wasn't last night.  Hey, here we go. 
[02:58:30]  Adam Lambert.  Adam Lambert.  I want to go to a Yankee game.  It's a learning process.  I'm over here, Maury.  I'm over here, Maury.  That's not funny.  They didn't even do the voice well.  Yes, it is.  They did...  Anthony, they did your impression, but with a bad voice.  That's called a tag, Sam.  They went with it.  They just did what Anthony said.  They got a laugh.  It's a tag.  Exactly.  They're just doing show jokes, and they have their own show.  That was a hide-and-seek progeria.  Primordial dwarf Sam voice.  Maury Povich joke. 
[02:59:00]  You sound like the kid from Glee.  Oh, that was terrible.  More Sam Roberts.  That's not from last night.  More Sam Roberts freak show.  That's not from last night.  Sirius XM Hitch 1.  I'm Sam Roberts, and I'm starting to believe that Kesha is not nearly as grimy as she'd like  us to believe she is.  Wake up in the morning feeling like that.  What the hell does that mean?  What does that mean?  I don't remember it was written months ago.  What does it mean?  Explain it.  Explain it.  I can't.  I don't remember.  I don't remember what I meant when I wrote it.  If it was funny or relevant, you would know right now. 
[02:59:30]  I would submit my own air checks for Jocktober, but it seems self-indulgent.  Hey, why don't you just queue that up for next week?  Because you've failed this week, obviously.  Oh!  See?  See?  You stink.  Oh, my God.  Look, they're coming in in droves now.  What does Troy got?  Troy's got some more.  Sam Roberts?  I'm?  No, he doesn't.  No.  Does the CD not work or something?  No.  That really is a nice taste of it.  It's just a duplicate.  Troy?  I like your teasing of the hot hits that are coming up. 
[03:00:00]  You are getting smunked.  And here's what's great.  Insert song hook here.  Teasing hot hits, boo.  No, you suck.  How great is it that Jocktober has turned on Sam?  Jocktober completely turned on you.  Insert song hook here.  Well, why don't we try another one, guys?  No, there's no reason to.  Let's do it.  We're going to try another one.  They're old breaks.  Sirius XM Hits 1. 
[03:00:30]  I'm Sam Robertson.  Date Night is the number one comedy movie in America.  It's not anymore.  Who would have thought that pairing Tina Fey with Steve Carell would be a success?  Of all the people.  Those guys running Hollywood must be geniuses, I tell you.  All of them geniuses.  Let me know what they'll think of next by Twittering me at twitter.com slash not Sam.  And he hit the post.  Boy, you've got to hit the post.  I want the Frick Show.  Frick Show, what did you think of that?  That was a terrific hit on the post.  Twitter me. 
[03:01:00]  I stop talking when the words come in.  I'm saying.  But they hit post, too.  You're like right out everything.  So, all right, I've got to finish this.  I've got to finish this in 20 seconds.  Yeah.  Yeah, he knows exactly how many seconds he's got.  It's a professional.  He faces his words out.  You suck, Sam.  I don't agree.  Yeah.  That was terrible.  And you sounded like you were reading.  Yeah.  Well, that's because it was the first time I had done it.  Oh, stop.  It wasn't.  It was a talking night. 
[03:01:30]  It just came out.  I just talked about date night on the radio yesterday, Sam.  You watched it on DVD.  So, you must be talking about the DVD.  Number one DVD in America.  I can't apologize enough for stupid Sam getting lazy with Jocktober.  And just pick shows out of a hat.  Squeeze your nuts when you start talking to them.  Hi, boys.  Well, I'm glad they don't go for easy jokes.  Squeeze your nuts.  I'm Sam Roberts.  That's not an easy joke.  That was clever, Sam.  Tell the freak show to stick to ants jokes.  Hard to believe that that...  Here's my Twitter. 
[03:02:00]  I'm over here, Maury.  That's the same one you did before, and it was ants jokes before.  Go back again, Sam.  That's the same joke.  You guys...  Please, I'm up to 65 followers.  I have more followers than the freak show, I'll bet.  Oh, please.  All right, gentlemen, we got to get going.  Yeah, I bet you do.  See you, guys.  Well, we're going to listen to Sam instead of you guys.  Why?  That's not even current.  This just turned into Samtober.  It was a complete misdiagnosis by Sam.  You didn't even hear the Mario Lemieux song.  We apologize, gentlemen. 
[03:02:30]  We're fans of the show, boys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  As are we of you.  That's right.  Big fans of the freak show in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, not all of us.  Thank you, freak show.  All right, guys.  Where do they go?  All right, in all fairness, we'll listen to the Mario Lemieux song.  Yeah, we'll listen to the Mario Lemieux song.  Let's see if they hit the post.  In all fairness.  Because that's what I did when I first started, not yesterday.  This is what they did yesterday.  All right.  I love how they were ragging you with these shit songs and hitting the post.  That's what they do.  I'm Sam Roberts and Black and Kesha and fucking, ugh. 
[03:03:00]  Here's the freak show doing their Mario Lemieux birthday song.  All right.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts, and rumor has it that Elin is officially going to file  for divorce from Tiger Woods.  Come on, Elin.  Will you give the guy a break?  What did Tiger ever do to you?  Really?  Hit me up on Twitter, twitter.com slash notsame.  Oh, enough.  Why are you doing old news stories?  Why?  I'm not.  I think they're officially divorced. 
[03:03:30]  What's wrong with you?  They were divorced a long time ago, like when that first aired.  Open up the fucking paper, man.  And what's with the, what did he ever do to you?  Like, what do you mean by that?  He cheated.  Everybody knows that.  Well, that's the joke.  Wait, where's the joke?  What's the joke?  It's the joke with all the humor parts removed.  Yeah.  Had a humorectomy.  That joke.  It's an obvious question.  Yeah?  But like, I'm like, what did he ever do to you?  What?  No, you were like, what did he ever do to you?  I noticed.  Hit me up.  Hit me up on Twitter.  Oh, God.  What are you in fucking junior high? 
[03:04:00]  I had junior high.  That's, that's, I mean, I mean, it's funny, but it's not accurate.  Hit me up.  All right.  Why don't we go back to the freak show?  Yeah, it's why don't we?  Mario Lemieux, birthday, a little song action.  Yeah, Mario Lemieux.  It's the Mario Lemieux song.  I'd like to.  All right.  SiriusXMH1.  That's not it.  I'm Sam Roberts, and in what alternate dimension is Rude Boy considered a compliment?  Wait.  What if this is the alternate dimension?  Oh, my head.  Oh.  Come on, Rude Boy, boy.  Can you get it? 
[03:04:30]  Oh, God.  Ew.  You have no fucking right to pick any shows to goof on.  And this is last night's show.  It's not last night's show.  So you've settled in at this point.  Somebody I know was driving around in their car listening to Hits 1, and the passenger said,  Ugh, who is this?  They're so lame.  Oh, shit.  Not knowing.  And it was Sam on the radio, and the passenger was a 14-year-old girl. 
[03:05:00]  So the driver was Anthony.  That 14-year-old girl should not have been up overnight.  You tell him, Sam.  You tell him.  They have some irresponsible parents.  It's obviously the 14-year-old has bad judgments, and she was up at 4 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, my head.  Oh, my head.  What's acting?  What's your Twitter name?  Nana?  How fucking old are you?  Nana.  He talks like a cartoon character.  And we definitely played that break the first time we did this.  No, we didn't, Sam.  Because you've already made fun of me for doing that break. 
[03:05:30]  Sam, stop with your lies.  It's terrible.  Look, you get the point.  So we'll move back into Jocktober.  It's the morning freak show with Big Bob and Mikey on Kiss 96.1.  And one in Pittsburgh.  Let's see.  Mario Lemieux, the birthday song.  Yes.  That you didn't like.  I thought it was lame.  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Roberts, and Lady Gaga has come out and said that she's celibate.  Do you think that includes both men and women?  Let me know on my Twitter, twitter.com slash notsam. 
[03:06:00]  Why with the Twitter every fucking break?  Who's going to Twitter your answer?  Yes, I agree.  Oh, yeah.  Sam, men or women.  Listen.  Stop trying to get a buzz started.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Stop trying to start chatter.  What are you doing with the Twitter plugs?  I'm not doing.  What was it?  What was it?  You're doing with the Twitter plugs.  What was it?  Sam's attempting a BuzzFeed.  Oh, he's trying really hard to fucking start chatter.  He wants to be trending.  Did you ever go to that site, BuzzFeed? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, BuzzFeed's pretty good.  That's, uh...  Yeah, I know, I know.  Do you want to say?  No.  Okay.  I know, though.  Well, Sam Roberts.  This is something that was.  Lady Gaga said she's celibate.  All right, well...  Again, was.  This is not current.  Ah.  Hey, you guys...  It's not good, either.  Hey, you like jokes?  I love jokes.  I love jokes.  Jimmy, you like jokes?  I love a good joke, Hope.  I like jokes.  Sam, do you like jokes?  No, I like Mario LeVue songs.  Well, I want to play a joke first, if you don't mind.  All right.  Is it okay that we do this on our show? 
[03:07:00]  It's your show.  You can do it.  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Roberts.  GE is putting out a light bulb that costs $50 but lasts for 17 years.  What happens if it breaks?  That's funny.  No, it's not.  I'd rather have that light bulb put in my asshole and broken than hear another one of these breaks.  Who on the breaks?  $50 light bulbs.  How much?  It's a bad investment if it breaks.  Oh, look at what Creepy Craig says.  He goes, oh, my head is covered in pubes. 
[03:07:30]  I don't have pubic.  Because your hair is like frizzy and fuzzy like pubic hair.  It doesn't make any sense.  In what dimension is rude boy a compliment?  Is that the fushizzle and the nizzle?  Oh, my head.  This is all way out of contract.  Mr. Febysham, my head hurts.  My head hurts.  My head hurts.  Oh, God. 
[03:08:00]  In what dimension?  We're losing focus.  You should get a job on WPU.  That's the U.  Oh, God.  We're way losing focus.  We're fucking crystal clear.  Like a diamond bullet.  I've never been more focused.  You want us to focus?  Yeah.  Yes.  You want us to focus?  I want to hear the song.  I'm Sam Robertson.  Sometimes songs don't need complicated lyrics.  For instance...  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey. 
[03:08:30]  I'm in the house.  Hey.  Yeah.  Is that it?  That was your whole break?  He says, well, that's a very short break between songs, so you've got to keep it quick.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  You can just promote it to Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah, why didn't you just go, Sam Robertson on Twitter.  I was criticized for doing that.  Oh, you were?  By who?  By who?  By who?  By who?  By you.  You.  By who?  I don't remember that.  Wow.  Why are you making a Charlie Sheen joke last night?  I didn't make a Charlie Sheen joke last night.  I said Charlie Sheen joke. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, did you do it, Charlie?  I don't remember.  It was so long ago.  A two and a half men joke?  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Roberts.  The press is saying Charlie Sheen is crazy for shaving his head.  Maybe he was just hot.  According to you.  That's funny.  That's clever.  It's neither of those things.  That is fucking nothing.  It's terrible.  Just a little quick thing.  You're just babbling.  I'd be embarrassed to think that alone, much less pick up a pen and write it.  That's terrible.  That's like this.  It's like, I'm Sam Roberts and I have a cup in my hand.  Yeah.  Like, because I just picked up a cup. 
[03:09:30]  Why don't you just do this?  Talk, talk, words, words, song.  Just say that.  Song soon.  Song soon, song now.  You have no right.  Oh.  You guys want to hear a...  I'd love to.  Whatever it is.  You want to hear a...  You're the pot calling your relatives black.  Oh, that's funny. 
[03:10:00]  Just leave the other shows alone.  You have no right.  This is just out of context.  October should be shows you aspire to be someday.  Hey, we didn't take many breaks today.  Can we do a live read in break or is that like a no-no?  Well, it's easier if we just actually break.  Oh, we could do that.  We're not breaking.  Give me a read.  Go ahead.  Watch this.  Watch how pro I am.  Watch how fucking pro.  Sam.  Sam.  Wait, why is that...  You watch me.  Why is that bad in show?  You watch me.  That's all. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, it'll work.  Don't worry.  Will it work, Danny, in the end?  I'm...  I'm Sam Roberts.  This is how we take care of our sponsors, though.  In show live reads.  It's nice.  Because no one's tuning the dial right now.  Are you ready to experience the rock show to end all rock shows?  Oh, my head.  How sweet it is.  In what universe is a rock show going to end other rock shows?  What dimension?  What dimension? 
[03:11:00]  Then get ready for the epic return of Rammstein.  It's the band that brought you the hit single, Do Host.  Do Host?  I don't even know Host.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Ugh.  God, Sam Roberts.  That song's out of our format.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh, because it's good?  Well, I disagree.  Yeah, I hear you.  Hey, it's the Berlin-based six-piece band.  It's bringing their industrial metal mayhem back to the United States for the first time 
[03:11:30]  since 2001, appearing for one night only.  This is exclusive as part of the Absolute Concert Series.  Rammstein is bringing their notorious live act to New York City's legendary Madison Square Garden.  And this new live show, it's traveled across from Europe in 2018, Wheelers.  It's packed with pyrotechnics, flamethrowers, bazookas, and enough ordinance to level a small country. 
[03:12:00]  Saturday, December 11th, it's your one and only chance to enjoy the destruction live on U.S. soil.  Well, tickets going on sale to the general public beginning Friday, October 8th at noon.  And tickets are going to be available at Ticketmaster.com and TheGarden.com.  TheGarden.com.  Don't miss your chance to see Rammstein when they blow the roof off of Motherson Square Garden  in New York on Saturday, December 11th. 
[03:12:30]  By the way, there's confusion when we suggested you get raped by a Lady Gaga CD.  Yeah.  I think you said sideways or something.  Someone on my Twitter said, no, full diameter.  Oh, wow.  Full diameter.  Like, shove it in the round way.  Full fucking diameter for you.  Right?  I don't want to do that.  Oh, wow.  That would hurt.  I don't want to do that.  Do we have another live read for everybody in a minute or two?  Oh, my God.  It would be fantastic.  We could probably finish out the show with commercials if you really want.  Oh, just fantastic.  See, then the listeners will really get pissed off. 
[03:13:00]  Are all of those?  They're already pissed off.  Is there any more audio?  Yeah, we got-  This is terrific stuff.  I know.  I really want to hear it.  What I want to do for the people out there is show you how a hits one DJ should sound.  Okay.  If that makes sense.  Sure.  Okay.  You can learn from this, Sam.  I disagree.  Part of October is teaching the hack show how to be better.  That's right.  This is what you're doing to me?  Yes.  Well, kind of.  Well, listen to your fucking show.  It's completely turned on me.  Well, it was last night's show.  When you pick a fucking show-  It wasn't last night's show.  I mean, if it was one of your first shows when you were getting comfortable and you had 
[03:13:30]  to get the nerves out, I would understand.  It was my second show that you just played.  Well, it says last night right there.  Then it's grossly mislabeled.  Here's a hits one jock doing it properly.  Okay.  The sound of Generation Now.  Now, now, now, series.  Coming up on the top of the hour, nothing to look forward to.  It's the same shit over and over again.  Coming up on the bottom of the day. 
[03:14:00]  Coming up on the top of the day.  Coming up on the top of the day.  Because you gotta be half a fag to listen to this station.  You gotta be white and the loafers to listen to this music.  Sirius XM.  Club soda Kenny.  Club soda Kenny.  Kelly.  It's...  There's no way that that would fly on that station.  That rules.  That's the way you do it, Sam.  There's no way that would fly on that station. 
[03:14:30]  Had the voice down.  You should be proud that he's imitating your voice, at least.  He sucked in helium.  Oh, really?  Yes, he got a helium tank.  He likes your voice.  He just doesn't like what you're saying with it.  The content of that would not fly at all on Hits 1.  Great.  I'd love to hear it.  You can hear the balloon.  Hi, I'm Club Soda Kenny on Sirius Hits XM1.  Saving the right station.  Sade, why is that bitch back? 
[03:15:00]  Nobody cared about her since 1984 in Smooth Operator.  That's funny.  I mean, they hit the post and everything.  But the record labels would be so upset.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  They should have a sense of humor.  As long as the music's being played, why should they give a shit?  See, that's right.  They just want to sell records.  Concert tickets.  Do we have a...  You ain't doing it.  We have any live drinks that we've got to get to?  I'm...  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.

[03:17:00]  I would like to hear the Mario Lemieux song.  It's a balloon.  Club Soda Kenny on Sirius XM Hits 1.  Selena Gomez is on a European tour.  She's only 17 now.  That's legal in some states, but on July 22nd, she'll be good to go.  Her song is Naturally.  Does that mean unclipped?  Hmm.  And then he goes, hmm, like primetime Sam Roberts. 
[03:17:30]  See, he's heard well from you, Sam.  The content was off and the break was way too long.  Hmm.  No, it was entertaining.  It's supposed to be the music doesn't stop.  It's about the music.  It was called good.  And he leaves you pondering.  No, he doesn't.  Hmm.  Where you sit there and go, yeah, I wonder if it's unclipped.  People are complaining, though, that Kenny is forgetting to give out his Twitter every break.  Yeah, I don't know why he's not doing that.  Oh, because that's the Sam Roberts thing to do.  If Sam does it, Club Soda Kenny should be doing it.  I don't do it anymore.  Uh, you want to hear more Club Soda Kenny? 
[03:18:00]  I did it my first day.  I'd like to make this a little bit.  This planet Earth turns slow.  The balloon.  I love that.  He just cursed over the end of the song.  Can we take you inside the bit?  What the fuck?  Kenny didn't realize that the outro is kind of long, so he sucked in the helium a little  too early.  And then he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  This one is not an XL channel by any stretch of the imagination. 
[03:18:30]  I bet he's all mad at that fucking song.  With the lungs full of helium, he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  Because he knows he has to suck in more, because he fucked up.  Oh, that's good.  What the fuck are you doing?  End the fucking song already.  Because my dreams are bursting at the sea.  Oh, my God.  Club Soda Kenny on Sirius XM Hits 1. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, do you think Kelly Clarkson is fat?  I'll let you know after she sits on my face.  Who would listen to this?  That's a fucking break.  Who wouldn't listen to this?  I would listen to that station.  They've got to play the same shit day in and day out, so why not have someone that's  going to fuck around a little bit?  Oh, that's great.  People would be very offended by that break.  Why offended?  Why offended?  I haven't entertained.  It's family programming.  I'm offended by your fucking breaks.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there a live read that we haven't done yet? 
[03:19:30]  Which, well, let me just...  I don't know.  I'm just looking around.  You know what?  Just make it sound natural if there is.  I don't even want to say anything.  But, Opie, I've got to tell you.  What?  Accept a random social network friend request from a tan, bikini-glad hottie named like Angie,  and you're really befriending Boris.  It's a pasty cybercriminal.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Seamless, my friend.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Seamless.  Absolutely.  We were talking about Club Soda Kenny and Sam, and the next thing you know, we're in the 
[03:20:00]  middle of a live read.  I didn't see this coming.  You don't even know it's a live read.  This is fucking brilliant.  This is like we're just talking.  Right.  You know?  You've got cyber criminals.  You guys are good.  And these are people who are about to get buddy-buddy with your online savings account,  leaving you penniless.  And with that empty, true friends-shouldn't-treat-each-other-that-way feeling.  Cyber criminals, oh, my God, they're everywhere.  In fact, 65% of adults claim to be the victims of cyber crime.  Wow.

Obviously, we all want you to kill yourself for the sake of the show.  Yeah, I don't like where this is going.  And spyguy925 on Twitter.  Sam's body should be drained of blood and cumed on by the entire Celtics team. 
[03:22:00]  Cumed on?  Well, I wouldn't know what was done with it after it was drained of blood.  All right, so you should be able to accept that, no?  If I'm not going to drain of blood, no.  Why?  Because then I would kill myself.  What's wrong with you?  And that's not something I'm willing to do.  What's wrong with you?  I want to live a fruitful life.  I want to live.  Well, I guess the cyberbullying is going to continue then.  What are you going to do when this whole radio thing just doesn't pan out for you as it isn't?  Television.  What do you have planned?  Right?  Television?  You don't think so?  Good luck there.  Yeah.  Film?  With that fucking head of hair, what are you going to do? 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  Are you going to be on a remake of Good Times?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you going to do?  Maybe they'll do a white remake of Good Times.  Well, then you'd be out.  Oh.  Because you're a black man.  Oh.  Anthony, Club Soda Kenny doing more Hits 1 for everybody.  What for?  Doing it the proper way.  Incredible.  Hi, I'm Club Soda Kenny on Sirius Hits 1.

He's doing dick jokes.  That's good.  He's doing dick jokes and getting away with it.  Very good.  Getting away with dick jokes.  And the song is called Blah, Blah, Blah.  That's funny, man.  That was very clever on Club Soda Kenny's car.  It wasn't clever.  It was vulgar.  Extremely clever.  You know, Obi, I got to tell you something.  What?  I hate Sam's show.  Oh, come on.

You're playing the same fucking songs every night, so show some disgust.  I'm not going to do any of those things.  This is how Kenny does it.  I like the songs.  This is how Kenny does it.  Hi, Club Soda Kenny on Series XM Hits 1. 
[03:26:00]  Do you know who is influenced by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and Michael Jackson?  If you answered a bunch of queers, you might be right.  According to Wikipedia, it's Lady Gaga.  That's funny.  Telephone.  That's funny.  Who wouldn't listen to that, Sam Ryan?  That's funny.  People would listen, but they'd also be outraged.  Outraged?  That's a...  He used a slur.  At laughing?  They'd be outraged at laughing? 
[03:26:30]  No, they'd be outraged at the slur used to describe people.  Sam, no one would be outraged by that at all.  I think we should listen to more.  Yeah, we got one more from Kenny here.  All right.  Wow.  It's Whippin' by Winston.  Madam, would you show your bosoms real quick?  Yeah, yeah.  Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  On the Opie Anthony Show on Sirius XM. </pre>
