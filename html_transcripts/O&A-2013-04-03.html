<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics.  The show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing Jim's experience at a Vice HBO screening.  This included encounters with *The Wire* actors and a Vice journalist's anecdote about getting drunk with Kim Jong-un.  They also discussed a Vice documentary segment showing the intensely ritualistic border closing ceremony between Indian and Pakistani guards, and another segment depicting North Korean escape routes.  The conversation then shifted to the scandal surrounding Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice, who was caught on video verbally and physically abusing his players, using homophobic slurs.  The hosts debated the context of his actions and compared it to other high-pressure coaching situations, touching on the cultural context of slurs like "faggot" and the "N-word."  They also briefly discussed Bubba Watson's proposed introduction of hovercrafts to golf.

The show then focused on Michael Jackson's death and the culpability of his doctor, Conrad Murray, including Murray's singing during an Anderson Cooper interview and his recorded prison phone calls.  This transitioned into a discussion of the effects of propofol.  A significant portion featured a surprise guest appearance by WWE wrestler Fandango, resulting in a comedic segment where the hosts struggled to pronounce his name, ultimately lotioning him and receiving WrestleMania tickets. This segment also included discussion about WrestleMania, Chris Jericho, CM Punk, and Paul Bearer's ashes, and a caller's anecdote about a mysterious object near the Statue of Liberty, concluding with an obscenity-laced chant.

A pre-recorded segment of "Scorch's PFG TV" was heavily critiqued, highlighting its low production values, inconsistencies (claiming to broadcast live from Santa Monica while in New Hampshire), and exaggerated claims. The hosts mocked Scorch's interviewing style, set design (a large, awkward table), and use of fake audience sound. Interviews with Lacey Rain (initially mistaken for a stripper, later revealed as a *Dancing with the Stars* dancer) and members of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra were also analyzed.  Jim Florentine was a guest during this segment, contributing to the critique and sharing a childhood anecdote about potential molestation.  The segment concluded with discussion of Scorch's co-host Sib Hashian and anticipation for the next guest, Louis C.K.

Louis C.K. then joined the show, discussing his experiences with fame, an encounter with an undercover cop, and his negative opinion of other comedians.  He talked about his new HBO special, "Oh My God," its production, and his self-distribution strategy.  A large portion of the interview focused on his 42-foot boat, financial situation, and plans for a "floating writer's retreat."  He launched into an expletive-laden rant about his frustrating experiences with SiriusXM and Equinox gyms, highlighting poor customer service.  The hosts briefly mentioned Fandango's earlier appearance and plans for a future collaboration with WrestleMania Radio Rose.  The show concluded with promotion of Louis C.K.'s work and a post-show segment featuring Sam Roberts and Eric, who discussed listener calls (including one from Canada about SiriusXM),  banter with Lady Trucker, and discussion of the show's phone screener, Sal.  Finally, the hosts briefly outlined the upcoming week's guest lineup, including a potential "Matt" (implied to be Matt Damon-esque) and Alan Thicke Jr.  They then announced the end of the show, with Ron and Fez's show following.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there? 
[00:03:30]  Nice to know.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do it.  It's going down jacking.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the O.P. and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome O.P.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  At it again.  Yes, we are.  James.  James Norton.  Jamie Norton.  Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga.  Did you guys go to that Vice thing?  Oh, great.  What?  I wanted to.  What happened?  Between having two kids and being completely fucking exhausted, I couldn't get my shit together.  Oh, man.  I'm not happy about it. 
[00:05:30]  I know it was awesome.  I'm sick over it.  And Jimmy was the first one there tweeting pictures of an empty room.  Oh, yeah.  It got filmed in like 15 minutes.  Did it?  Yeah.  It was mobbed right after that.  Eager, Jimmy.  Getting there all early.  It was a 7 o'clock thing.  Right.  And I walked in at 6.54.  Like, I thought it was a 7 o'clock screening.  It was like a little cocktail party.  I was the first performer, like, non-photographer there.  Right.  And I walked in and they're like, you want to walk the press line?  And it's like photographers and there's nobody there. 
[00:06:00]  So I was like, yeah, I'll walk in.  Because I was like, they'll all take my picture.  Of course.  Oh, what a great.  Wow.  They'll at least want to see if their cameras are working.  That's exactly what they did.  No.  Come on.  I'm sure it'll pop up somewhere.  That's right.  Yeah.  But I'm so bad at those things.  Like, all the heads of HBO were there.  All the heads of Vice.  And, like, then Jonathan knows all of them.  Right.  And I'm helpless until he gets there.  I'm literally just two of the guys from The Wire were there. 
[00:06:30]  Isaiah.  Right.  Oh, nice.  And Banga.  You know, fucking Partlow.  Yeah.  Marlow's guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was fun, man.  It was a lot of fun.  It was, they showed two episodes, two 30-minute episodes, which were amazing.  One I'd already seen.  The other one I had not.  And they showed part of the North Korea episode where, when they sent Rodman to North Korea.  Yeah.  But they hardly show Rodman in this clip they showed.  They had three of the Globetrotters with him. 
[00:07:00]  So they show.  Wait.  Some Globetrotters went with Dennis Rodman?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he went with Vice Guys.  Right.  And three of the Globetrotters.  Right.  And Dennis didn't play.  It was...  No, I know.  I just kind of chilled.  Yeah, he watched it with Kim Jong-un.  And it was...  And the guys that actually did that piece were there.  So I was talking to one of them about it.  And he was just telling me about getting drunk with Kim Jong-un.  It was really fucking interesting.  Wow.  Wait, one of the Globetrotters got drunk with...  No, no, no.  One of the...  Vice Guys.  One of the Vice Guys was telling me how he got fucking...  He got drunk with Kim Jong-un and... 
[00:07:30]  For real?  Yeah.  And this big party and he did a toast.  Right.  And he took a sip and then he said, Kim Jong-un starts yelling at me from across the room.  Whoa.  And I was like, you don't know if you've offended him.  And he was yelling, finish your drink.  Finish your drink.  It was like any other fucking idiot at a party.  Chug it.  Chug it.  Wow.  Exactly.  What were they drinking?  You know what he told me and I forgot.  It was either scotch or rum or something.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit.  But they were...  That fucking show, man.  That is awesome.  It was...  I hate saying awesome, but it was just...  I can't think of a better way to describe it. 
[00:08:00]  I can't wait to see it.  Yeah, I've seen the highlight clips and it looks amazing.  India and Pakistan are going to have a nuclear war.  Yeah.  We're dead.  You know we're fucking dead.  That's it.  Eventually, they're just going to go at it.  We are.  They do a bit on the most dangerous border in the world.  Where they show off for each other?  Yes.  Where they walk to the end?  Yeah, I've seen that before.  Fucking horrifying.  It's literally the border and they just fucking show off.  And people gather at the border every day to...  What is it?  It's the border guards or something?  Yeah.  And they put on this ridiculous display every day and they get into each other's faces. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  Like at any moment, it could be a major problem in that area that would just completely spread.  Every day there's an...  I know a little bit about that.  Incredible tension.  I had never seen that.  You've never seen that before?  Somebody else absolutely went down there and filmed that shit.  Where they do the high stepping and they just get all like fucking...  I can't really explain.  There might be a video online.  They get in each other's faces.  Yeah.  And people show up to the border every day to check this shit out.  To watch it? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  It's almost a show.  But it's so real.  Jesus.  You wonder what...  Because there's one point where the Kashmir border is where there's a problem.  Right.  And it's quiet and beautiful.  And you can't see how much tension there is there.  But there's a bridge where you walk across.  And in the middle of the bridge, there's a white line.  And one side's India.  And the other side's Pakistan.  And of course, Shane walks out to the middle of the line.  And there's a white line.  And they tell them, if you step over the line, they will shoot you. 
[00:09:30]  They will shoot you.  Yeah.  They hate each other, those countries.  Oh, wow.  And of course, they're putting out in the middle of the fucking bridge, putting their foot in the line.  It was really good, man.  It was fucking great.  That's great.  Yeah, here it is.  Yeah, see?  Oh, my God.  This might have been the video I've seen.  They have stands.  They look wacky.  Suddenly, the atmosphere gets heavier as the closing of the border ceremony begins.  Now, this is more like it.  Wacky mustaches.  Officers seem to be selected on the basis of their facial hair. 
[00:10:00]  But facial hair alone is not enough.  Look, look at this.  You also have to gain approval from the Ministry of Silly Walks before being signed up for this.  Yeah, they get this weird walk going.  They do a military walk to the border.  Yeah.  Very parade-like.  It's really bizarre.  It would help if we could show the people this.  But why are people sitting there eating popcorn like it's just a fun little event?  It's a whole cultural thing.  They fucking hate each other.  They got stands set up, bleachers or whatever. 
[00:10:30]  Look at this little stampy thing they're doing.  They stamp everywhere they go.  It's so silly.  These strutting peacocks aren't confined to the Indian side of the border.  Boy, do they not like each other.  Not to be outdone, the Pakistanis take the evening display every bit as seriously.  Wow.  They hate each other.  Hilarious.  You figure one of them would walk up to the border and just look over and go, hi.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're feet away from each other.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Put this on our Facebook page, L.B. and Anthony.  This would be a great visual to show the people right now.  And they both have nukes.  Oh, yeah, they do.  But that's the thing that's keeping the war from happening.  Both of them really do know.  Watch.  They get right in each other's faces.  There you go.  That's where the war could start.  They're three feet away from each other.  Holy shit.  They are fucking a white line away from each other.  This is like a soccer game mentality that they all have. 
[00:11:30]  What if you thought your seat in the bleachers was over there and you made a mistake and went  over the line?  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm over there.  It's a whole thing where they take their flags down at the border.  And I guess they do it at the exact same time every day.  So it's like these guys on the border probably have some kind of a camaraderie, whether they  know it or not, because they're in the same ritual.  Right, look, look, look.  They walk right at each other.  And they're doing the same moves. 
[00:12:00]  But they're...  Are they just shook hands?  Yeah.  They're a little handshake.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there's some kind of a ritualistic thing here.  And then they close the fucking border.  Oh, I didn't know they shook hands.  Okay.  Well, in this video they did.  I don't know if they still practiced the handshake.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Yeah, so I've seen that before.  But I'm sure Shane Smith really filmed some good stuff on the border.  Dude, they had to work out the steps with each other.  Yeah, they were secretized.  You know, at some point they had to get together to work out the steps. 
[00:12:30]  So, I mean, I know they hate each other, obviously.  But like those guys, the border guard?  Not so much, probably.  Probably not so much.  They probably look at each other like, well, like a sports team.  Right.  They have a rivalry.  Right, right.  Those guys, you know why?  Because those guys see each other every day.  Yeah.  Like they see, they're right in each other's faces every day.  It's like the North and South Korean guards that stand.  Yeah.  Which, of course, in one of the episodes they go to fucking, they're showing you how to get North Korean.  They're showing you how North Koreans escape from North Korea. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, really?  And they can't go through South Korea because of the DMZ.  They said it's an eight-mile thing of fucking landmines and armed North Korean military guys who will shoot on sight.  Yeah.  So they can't just go to South Korea.  They have to go up through China and take a bus thousands of miles and go through Laos.  And, you know, of course, I wish I was at the table with one of the guys who was in that piece.  And I wish I had asked him because he was one of the guys on this fucking boat with like the black and white lighting. 
[00:13:30]  Like literally if they got arrested, they're going to jail in Loatia.  Oh, boy.  These guys are fucking, they're fucking psychopaths.  Nice.  It was so good, man.  It was such a good fucking show.  I can't wait to see that.  When is the show premiere?  I don't know.  I should probably know that.  I don't.  It's on HBO, Vice.  Is it called just Vice or?  Not Vice.  It's called.  It might be just called.  It's called Vice.  It is called Vice.  When's the premiere, do you know?  And, of course, Jonathan spilled fucking champagne on one of the guys.  Did he really?  He's such a nice guy. 
[00:14:00]  But he hit it with his cock?  No.  Did he have his designer jeans on?  No, you couldn't.  And his wife was with him, so I couldn't look at his bulge.  I didn't want her to get mad at me.  If she caught me, she'd probably go, I know.  Yeah.  Believe me, she's walking with a limp.  I just couldn't do it.  We were pointing and giggling at us in Boston.  That's great.  Waiting for the fucking, the Accela.  Because he just stands there clueless that he has this giant fucking penis on display at all times.  You could see on the train when he was just standing. 
[00:14:30]  You could actually see his cock head.  Oh, God.  It's fucking, I can't, it's fucking huge.  Like a mule?  Yeah, it's literally like he has a fucking, like a World War II uniform in front of his pants.  But he's, is he aware or not?  I think he's probably just so, it's almost like if you were walking around with just gold bullions.  He'd be so used to, to your gift.  He's got these kind of tight jeans and it's, something's always pressing, pressing outwards. 
[00:15:00]  He's just not a pervert.  It's just not his, he's just a nice.  But not to have an awareness.  I mean, yeah.  Women all over the fucking place and certainly some men, I guess, are getting a little, a little juiced up.  Because Jonathan's bulge that he's not aware of.  Visual treat.  You know who was there who I didn't meet and I wanted to was Steve Croft from 60 Minutes.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, man.  I'm really bummed I didn't fucking, but I was getting late.  I was like, I had to get all of them.  A lot of celebrities.  No, I mean, it was only just, just him and, it was mostly industry people. 
[00:15:30]  It was, and you know who David Cho is, that artist?  He's a great artist.  He was there.  I talked to him for a while.  He's a very nice guy.  He's apparently very wealthy.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a podcast with Yoshi.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do podcasts together.  I think our fan base certainly will be watching this Vice show.  It's fucking fantastic.  It's made for them.  Yeah, it's like investigative journalism, but it's done by people who speak like we speak.  Yeah.  And guys who, but they're not just talking shit. 
[00:16:00]  Like, they're really going to dangerous, dangerous areas.  Right.  It's crazy.  I will never go on a fucking field piece with them.  Yeah, right.  Ever.  You'll fucking end up.  I wasn't able to go.  I had a red eye.  Oh, how was it?  Last night.  Good.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Apparently, you're on what, tonight?  I may not do it, though.  Oh, damn you.  No, I'm editing my special, and I'm in that.  It's like, right, I start writing at three in the afternoon when I get those notes.  Right.  So it's like, I'm going to be in the editing thing, like, probably until fucking seven or eight at night.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  Yeah, they put your name up and your picture last night, and I went, Jimmy.  You're a retard.  If they're lucky, I may have to do it.  Well, indeed.  But I don't think I can to that.  Very cool, man.  Yeah, I wanted to go to that.  What else is in the first episode of Vice?  It was, uh, the two, the two stories they do was the child, it's called, I think it's  Child Killers of the Taliban, which were child suicide bombers. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  Is that depressing?  Yes.  It makes you hate the Taliban even more, and, uh...  Did it feel for the kids?  Absolutely.  Sure.  You don't hate them because you realize what they're told.  Right.  And they're just 13, 14, and you realize they're uneducated in what they're told by these mullahs.  Right.  To get them to commit suicide bombers.  Like, and, um...  And they interview someone.  It's fucking amazing, the access.  Speaking of kids, did you see the picture of the Syrian soldier?  The seven-year-old?  Ah.  That went around over the weekend? 
[00:17:30]  The video.  It's great.  Oh, there's a video.  Oh, he's smoking butts.  He's fucking...  Yeah, he's...  He's fucking yelling.  He looks like...  He absolutely looks like an adult, how he smokes his cigarette, he's got his automatic fucking  weapon.  He's got a fucking AK-47 in his hands, bigger than him.  The one that's guarding, uh, something?  He's outside the, uh, I forget now, the Syrian boy soldier with a thousand-yard stare, the  set image of child, age seven.  Yeah, that's the one.  Look at this fucking kid.  Just smoking a cigarette like an adult. 
[00:18:00]  It looks like he could handle his weapon.  Yeah, he's crazy.  Not scared at all.  He's gone.  His fucking parents were blown up.  Right.  So he, uh...  Joined the army at seven.  Yeah, he just fucking got himself a gun.  Cigarettes.  And that's the problem with, like, Liberia and a lot of this, the Congo.  It's like, these are all kids with no fucking adult supervision.  Yeah.  See, there's like a bunch of...  Dude, there's a bunch of fucking kids that are like 13, 15, 18 that are just...  They're almost unreachable.  They're fucking crazy.  Right.  They had guns their whole lives, and they've just, they've been in wars. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Amazing.  No hope there.  I don't remember the other story.  It was the fucking...  India, Pakistan, fucking North Korea, and this was, um...  I don't remember.  It was fucking, uh...  I think I just mentioned it.  I'm losing my fucking memory.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  You didn't mention it?  No, I touched on what it was.  It was the...  The suicide...  Oh, no, in the Philippines.  The election...  The deadliest place in the world to run for office is the Philippines.  The deadliest place to run for office.  So they do a story on the guy who is going to register to run for governor or whatever. 
[00:19:00]  Why would you do that?  I really don't know.  This power.  It's power, and that equals being rich.  Right.  And I think the year before, like, a lot of members of his family and party were executed,  going to register.  Just 50 people were murdered, going to register.  How many countries aren't fucked up, you think?  I don't know.  I mean, we got our problems in America, but I wouldn't say we're fucked up like some of  these other...  We don't have candidates being murdered left.  No, I'm just saying in general.  Right. 
[00:19:30]  I think more countries in the world...  We don't have children wandering around as suicide bombers.  We don't...  You know...  How many countries are really just fucked up out there?  I think more in the world are fucked than are, like...  Civilized.  Civilized and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Definitely more clusterfucks in this world.  Way more, right?  Yeah.  Way more.  Yeah.  I think the...  I mean, you got Canada, you got America, but then you start going south of the U.S., it  starts getting pretty fucked up.  It's a little dodgy.  It gets a little dodgy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I definitely would think that there's more fucked up things in the world.  You throw Australia in there, they're okay. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You know, a lot of Europe's okay.  But then you start getting outside Europe.  Yeah.  Anything you don't know about is fucked.  Most of Africa seems like it's fucked up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're just lucky we were born...  That's pretty much what it is.  ...in the United States.  The luck of the draw.  Look at you.  Yeah.  There's so much luck involved.  There's luck just to be born, obviously.  Good old dad squirted his goo in a good country.  Right.  That's it.  Yeah.  We're lucky to be born. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, the odds of just even being born is ridiculous.  And then you're born in a civilized country.  Yeah.  Thank God.  You know, we're not seven-year-old Syrian soldiers.  Yeah.  Because you never know.  You never know.  With no hope.  Yeah.  Like Shane Smith was talking about with Shit Beach and all that.  You know, that's what bothered him.  And when he goes to these places, he sees the kids and stuff and realizes that they have  no future whatsoever.  Not even a chance at one.  There's a cool moment where he's sitting with the family of a suicide bombing victim. 
[00:21:00]  They lost like nine members of their family in one bombing at a shrine.  And it was an interesting perspective.  Wow.  Because you never...  Like, we hear like Afghanistan suicide bombings.  Like, I fucked them.  And that's how I feel.  Fuck this savage.  But then you forget like that they're bombing other Muslims who are like...  Hey, what'd I do?  What kind of Muslims would do this to us?  Right, yeah, yeah.  Like, they're as fucked by it as anybody else.  They hate it too.  It was really, really great.  And the fucking North Korea episode, they showed like 10 minutes of it. 
[00:21:30]  And I was fucking angry.  Like, I wanted to see more of it.  But it was actually pretty moving.  There was one part where it was actually moving.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're showing the Globetrotters interact with some North Korean kids.  And it was really, really fucking good.  Right.  Almost no Rodman in what I saw.  Like, I guess they're saving that.  Right.  But they didn't just...  It wasn't just like Dennis Rodman acting wacky.  It was really, really good.  I bet you they don't have a lot of great footage of him over there.  Probably not too much, no.  He mumbles.  He's really mellow.  I don't really see where they're going to get a lot of...  Well, there is footage of him singing my way. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, they are?  A big party or something.  Oh, there it is.  Wow.  Yeah, with the fucking leader of a nuclear country.  Classic.  Very good.  So, the Rutgers basketball coach.  What was happening?  I see you tweet something.  Oh, yeah.  Well...  Mike Rice.  Obviously, as I look up, it's already on...  It's been on TV all morning long.  They're going to crucify this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have to fire him.  But all I was trying to say...  All I'm trying to say, because I said I hope people defend this guy,  and I hope some ex-players come out of the woodwork, 
[00:22:30]  is it's the culture of playing the sport.  It's the culture of just being on a team.  I remember my high school...  I played basketball for a lot of my earlier years,  and we were fucking scared shitless of our coaches all the time, man.  Yeah.  And you're seeing, like, a montage of his greatest hits.  I would assume that he wasn't throwing the ball at the players every single second.  But if you fucking line it up and, you know, show how fucking nasty this guy could be... 
[00:23:00]  It looks...  It looks way worse.  It looks bad.  If you...  Yeah, you put a montage together like that.  The fact is, Bobby Knight was a complete and utter asshole.  Total psycho.  But his team...  But his players loved the guy.  Yeah.  And I would imagine that they probably have...  If people were filming, they probably would have some great stuff from Bobby Knight as well  when he was coaching in practice.  Here's what I noticed when I was watching the clips and stuff. 
[00:23:30]  The players never winced.  They never, like, looked surprised.  Right.  Like, oh, fuck, this guy's gonna hurt me or he's doing something.  It looked like it was just a normal part of their practice.  So I was kind of looking like, they know the deal.  They know their coach does this.  Right.  And are they good?  Were they good under him?  I don't think they were.  No?  No.  But... 
[00:24:00]  But that's, like, his coaching style.  Well, who gives a shit?  Well, they are so outraged out there.  And I think it's coming from a lot of people that never really played organized sports on  that level.  Yeah, it is sort of.  I mean, when you join some of these teams, it's like entering...  I don't want to downplay, you know, the military.  But it does have kind of a boot camp, you know, feel to it.  You got that mentality to it where...  Right.  It's way worse when you join the military.  I don't want people to fucking twist my shit here.  But it does have that same feel. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, he's got to be the fucking guy that's in charge.  Right.  And, uh...  Yeah, it's got to be his fucking way.  Once again, you know, he's yelling faggot and fairy and you're a faggot.  Oh, no, they got him with those words.  They got him with those horrible words.  Oh, no.  You know, when the mics aren't on and the video's not rolling, guess what?  I hate to tell people, but those words are used.  People don't understand.  They're...  Are they outraged?  They're...  Are they...  Is there outrage? 
[00:25:00]  This guy is so fired.  They're not going to let him...  They're not going to let him go.  Everyone's...  Look, it was just on two out of three of our TVs.  Yeah, yeah.  He's done.  He's done.  We're shocked by what's going on in that practice.  It's really worth, you know, taking a look at it very, very hard.  And so Rutgers has been sitting on this in a way since November.  And a lot of people are saying that, you know, the heat shouldn't just be on rice.  It should be also be on Pernetti and the other university officials who saw this video and  didn't take more action.  The first thing I thought when I was hearing some of the homophobic slurs in this is... 
[00:25:30]  Shut the fuck up.  I meant you went to Rutgers.  I mean, this is a university that had massive soul-searching about how you treat people and  how words matter and words can hurt.  And you have a leader of the university who's on tape saying something to students like this.  Yeah, and a lot of people are saying it's hypocritical at the university.  This will be a tough day at Rutgers.  Worth watching.  Oh, shut up.  Thanks to you.  All right.  New developments as much.  What does that stupid blonde know about organized sports at a university?  Wow, did we tune in at an angering fucking segment of...  Obviously, it's really, really tough to defend the guy. 
[00:26:00]  But all I'm saying is, as someone that played in organized sports on a relatively high level,  I kind of get it.  Whoa.  What the hell was that?  Fucking light just blew out.  This shit is crazy.  I'm going home.  We're losing light.  A light bulb just went off.  Let's see how long it takes for them to fix it.  Fucking mean something.  The dumbest coming.  What do you got on this thing?  I just wanted to mention when she was talking about the homophobic slurs and everything, 
[00:26:30]  is that Rutgers kid who killed himself because his roommate was spying on him.  Yeah.  Fine.  Tape the fucking kid.  That's way worse than what this coach did.  But her comment is at the school.  Huh?  You know.  Oh, I think they're talking about Imus.  I think they're talking about that.  Okay.  But here's the problem I have.  I think they are talking about Imus as well.  I don't understand.  You fucking...  He wasn't calling the guy gay a faggot.  He's calling one of his players a faggot for not fucking hustling or something. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, no.  For not being out there and giving his all.  Because the word faggot is one of those dual meaning words.  It's a derogatory term for a gay person.  And then it's a term that you use for your friends that are completely heterosexual when  they're acting like faggots by not going out, not fucking coming to the table, not fucking  giving their all.  It's like when you call somebody a douche.  You don't literally mean, you bottle of vinegar.  We know what that means. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, God.  There's no context with anything anymore.  No.  Nothing.  And then it does look bad because it's his highlight reel of him acting like an asshole.  I told Ed, I don't think...  I would bet practices went by where he didn't throw a ball at a kid and practices went by  without him yelling faggot or fairy or pushing him as well.  But you put it all together like that.  Yeah, of course it's really tough to defend.  But ESPN apparently has hundreds of hours of videos.  Oh, do they? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  So why didn't the players come out before now?  How long has he been a coach there?  Because the players don't give a fuck.  Are they complaining?  Did one player finally complain?  I know one player transferred because they didn't like his coaching ways, which is fine.  This was filmed by someone on the team, but not like a player.  Uh-huh.  He was like an employee of Rutgers.  Ew.  Some fucking slut.  So Rutgers saw the video and they chose to suspend him.  But I do have a problem with that as well because he's secretly being taped as well. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, you know, it's no one's business unless someone complained, I guess.  Obviously the players, they probably get together and are like,  Jesus Christ, the coach is a fucking maniac today.  No one likes a basketball thrown at your head.  Right.  We were scared to look our basketball coach in high school in the eye.  We didn't want to.  And we avoided him.  When he was walking down the hall all tough like a fucking, I'm an athlete that almost made it bullshit.  Yeah.  We basically would go, hi, gosh, and be like kind of looking down at the floor and couldn't wait to pass him by. 
[00:29:00]  And we had brutal practices.  I don't think it was on that level, to be honest with you.  I'm not trying to like totally attach myself to the story.  But he was someone to fear.  But he's yelling, you faggots, playwright.  He's not saying, you homosexuals.  Right.  And everybody, like if you say, you fucking chinks or you gigaboos, you're either, you're making a racial slur.  Everyone knows there's very little. 
[00:29:30]  It doesn't fit.  There's no dual meaning there.  There's no dual meaning there.  Are you faggots is one of those weird words that you yell at each other where you're not thinking of homosexuals.  Really got to, got to, you know, got to say, hey, sorry, gay community.  But one of the derogatory words has a dual meaning.  It has forever.  And people still use it.  Invertibly abusing his players.  I'm sorry, I just want to see what these guys, I should say, outside the lines, aired this video of Rice shoving players during practice, throwing basketballs at them from close range.  Come on.  He can also be heard berating his players and using homophobic slurs. 
[00:30:00]  Homophobic.  Dude, they're recording your practice.  Rutgers athletic director Tim Grenade had been given a copy of the tape in late November.  He saw it, as did the president of the university.  But they chose not to fire Rice after they saw the tape.  Instead, they suspended the coach for three games and fired him 50 grand, ordered him to enter anger management classes. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, really?  Talked to everybody in the program.  We looked at hundreds of hours of practice film to put it in context.  But needless to say, there was a lot of behavior here that was unacceptable and is not to the Rutgers standard.  That's why we handed out the significant amount of suspension that we did and all the things that came along with that.  It's an unfortunate situation.  You know, definitely was not an instance where I had a line of people out at my door concerned about the matter.  But as soon as we were made aware of the fact, we dealt with it.  And Mike obviously paid a significant price for that.  That was the athletic director yesterday.  This story has changed since he gave that soundbite. 
[00:31:00]  A public outcry over the tape reportedly has caused Pernetti, the athletic director there, to take a new look at whether or not to let Mike Rice go.  New Jersey governor Chris Christie among those to voice his disapproval after seeing the tape.  Hey, Christie, what the fuck do you know about sports?  Shut up!  He's deeply disturbed by the conduct displayed and strongly condemns the behavior.  LeBron James weighing in tweeting, if my son played for Rutgers or for a coach like that, he'd have some real explaining to do.  And I'm still going to whoop on him afterwards.  You know what he's got on right now?  Oh, good. 
[00:31:30]  You didn't have any of those stereotypes of violence.  Shut up!  If you're a trustee of Rutgers, if you can preview to Rutgers, it's not just the coach you're looking at now.  You've got to look at the AD and you've got to say, okay, you saw this tape several months ago and you just suspended him for three games.  I'm sorry.  And he didn't want to do that.  He knew he had to do something.  The Rutgers to be treated like that, to be verbally abused, to be pounded.  The athletic director has to have the judgment to look at that situation.  They're going to kill this guy.  He's done.  They have found a victim. 
[00:32:00]  This isn't even close.  They have found a victim.  This isn't even a fucking, like, a marginal fucking call here.  This guy's done.  Can we please just crucify him live on TV?  Because that's what you want to do.  Yeah.  Have him drag across through the fucking streets.  Oh, my God.  Where's the public outrage?  I don't hear anything.  Because the media is pushing this hard now?  Well, nobody...  By the way, the phone's already lit.  I don't know if we want to take calls.  Everyone, so far, everyone understanding.  And all had a coach that sort of did some shit. 
[00:32:30]  There's public outcry today because nobody had seen the video until yesterday.  You see the players.  They're like...  They get it.  The problem is...  The governor weighs in.  Sorry.  That is ridiculous.  Beyond that, you're talking about this is an adult who's doing this to minors.  I mean, this is not...  Minors are in college.  They're college students.  But it's just...  It's kind of an outrageous abuse of authority that you would never tolerate in any other  facet of Rutgers.  If an English professor or any other member of the faculty treated a student who was paying 
[00:33:00]  $25,000 a year to get a Rutgers this way...  Yeah, but athletes are treated differently.  We all know that.  They're yelled at more harshly, but they're also given fucking scholarships and treated better  too.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to change my Twitter profile picture in support.  Of the coach.  Oh, that means you care.  That means I care so much.  Yeah.  You're doing something.  Slacktivism. 
[00:33:30]  I love it.  Slacktivism.  He is a douche, though, the guy.  I mean, and he's just...  The coach?  Yeah, he's fine.  You can't throw basketballs at players.  At their heads, yeah.  You can't.  I'll tell you this.  I will say this, though.  If one of those players would turn around and punch them in the...  Because if you're yelling at a guy is one thing, but if you throw a ball at somebody's  head, that will probably get your teeth knocked out in most...  Yeah, well...  You know what?  They're not even focusing that much on the throw in the basketball as much as they are  the homophobic language.  The homophobic language.  Which is... 
[00:34:00]  All these assholes on TV totally understand that shit, too.  Yeah.  They totally understand the difference.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's hard to defend, but all I'm saying is I kind of understand it.  It is the culture of being on some of these teams, you know?  Yeah.  Every one of those guys is hoping to be, you know, in the NBA.  They all got scholarships.  Yeah.  And they take it extremely seriously.  Very different than going to an English class. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  They'll fire the athletic director.  They're going to fire everybody.  Oh, clean house.  Which is too bad.  Get everyone out of there.  And then have some kind of sensitivity training.  And then...  It might be different if it wasn't Rutgers.  Rutgers, but the whole homosexual thing.  Yeah.  Oh, he's fucked.  You'll need counselors for the fucking students now.  And all kinds of fucking kumbaya shit.  And the Rutgers program is less than mediocre, right?  No, they're terrible.  So this guy's really trying to get something done over there.  Maybe, you know.  I mean, it's Rutgers basketball. 
[00:35:00]  But if you're going to yell faggot and throw a ball at somebody's head,  you better have a winning record.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, maybe that's...  It's obviously not working.  Like, he should try the nice approach.  Come on, make a basket.  Yeah, really.  His approach isn't working.  I would guarantee that Bobby Knight has a great highlight reel as well.  Yeah.  But I guess they probably weren't taping him a lot in practice.  Well, didn't he choke a motherfucker?  He did all sorts of crazy-ass shit.  These coaches are absolutely nuts.  And you understand that to a point.  Jesus.  We've played the Bobby Knights shit over the years. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Him yelling and screaming at his players in the locker room at halftime  and saying just horrific shit.  I remember one tape we played.  Do we have that, E-Rock?  Are you looking at Bobby Knight shit?  Hang on.  What?  I remember we played one that was over the top.  Yeah, I was listening.  I had a coach in high school.  He was the same way.  Every coach in America is burning their practice reels today.  You're right.  At that level of college ball, all practices are taped. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, okay.  Rutgers program, less than mediocre.  It's bullshit.  And we are ruining our country by fucking up organized sport.  I must say.  That's what's coming in right now.  I never knew in school of any coaching or anything.  I wasn't involved in any extracurricular activities.  But I do know the gym teacher mentality, and that was bad enough.  Right.  And he's just trying to fucking get us to put our fucking shorts and t-shirt on and run  around the track.  I'm not saying they're not assholes.  And he was fucking, you know, an asshole. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not saying this guy isn't an asshole.  But I never felt like, you know, I never felt like complaining to anyone.  To me, that was part of the fucking, part of the, part of gym class.  Right.  Yeah.  You got a good Bobby Knight tape?  Yeah.  It's a halftime prep clip.  Is that the same one you got?  I don't know.  All right.  You got to play it.  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover, Greg Graham, if you're just going to let him drive  by you, if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second 
[00:37:00]  lane and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him, then I'm leaving and  you fucking guys will run until you can't eat something.  Now, I'm tired of this shit.  I'm sick and fucking tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm fucking tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to fuck around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to fucking guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you  aren't going to believe in the next four fucking days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday. 
[00:37:30]  Now, you better fucking understand that right now.  This is absolute fucking bullshit.  Now, I'll fucking run your ass right into the ground.  I mean, I'll fucking run you.  You'll think last night was a fucking picnic.  I had to sit around for a fucking year with an 8-10 record in this fucking lane.  And I mean, you will not put me in that fucking position again, or you will goddamn pay  for it like you can't fucking believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  That's all I'm saying is the culture.  And I'm telling you, in practices, I would bet a lot of money that he threw fucking basketballs. 
[00:38:00]  I would bet a lot of money.  And I would bet a lot of money that he used some absolute, he fucking used slurs.  I'll tell you that.  It was just a halftime speech.  I bet he didn't.  I guarantee you.  He didn't berate them once.  He choked a fucking player.  We got that, too.  He didn't call anyone any names.  No.  That's just one speech is all I'm saying.  I know.  I know, but it's a...  But that's...  Nobody would be giving shit for that today.  No.  But throwing a ball at somebody's head and then calling them a...  Like, you fucking... 
[00:38:30]  I don't have a problem with it, but that's Bobby Knight is yelling and screaming.  And he's...  That's acceptable coach shit.  Yeah.  That's acceptable coach yelling.  All I'm saying is if he's saying that at halftime, I guarantee he's doing some other shit in practice.  Plus, it's a completely...  He's just lucky they don't have, you know, a lot of tape of him, I guess.  It's a different culture now, though.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  Bobby Knight is considered one of the greatest coaches ever.  And everybody knows that he did that.  But if he did that today...  Oh, in the pussification of America, that doesn't...  If he was a no-name... 
[00:39:00]  Times have changed.  Well, that's what we fight all the time here on this show.  It's frustrating how much things have changed.  You can't even play dodgeball in school, you think.  Right.  Exactly.  You can throw basketballs in people's heads.  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  No, that is a good point.  Jesus Christ.  It's great.  He is finished.  I love listening to that shit.  It's just...  Oh, how do you sit there and take that...  You're probably just sitting there going, oh, I want this to stop.  Oh, my God.  I want this to stop so quickly.  Please stop the yelling.  This is very uncomfortable.  I'd say something.  I'd be like, yeah, well, you think this is accomplishing anything? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, shit.  That's nice language.  Oh, shit.  I can't imagine.  My ears are not garbage cans.  I'd be like the lady from Dog Day Afternoon.  Oh, my God.  My ears.  He was just looking and going, what the fuck?  What the hell?  Hey, if you think you're such hot tomatoes, why don't you go out there and do it?  What the fuck?  I've got scholastics to keep up with.  What are you saying?  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Oh, you know, you got to get used to it.  That's what it's like on a job site.  Oh, yeah.  F this, F that.  What the heck? 
[00:40:00]  Who the hey?  Get me my lunch pail.  What the hell do I know?  Lunch pail.  You dribble the ball.  I'll build something.  Stupid regular Joe.  That's a big story.  When does he get fired?  Today, probably.  Oh, he's so gone.  Tomorrow or the later.  Because now everyone's focusing on Rutgers, so they're probably sitting there like, we're  going to fucking fire him.  They'll do another day on us, and they'll move on to something else.  Here's why.  Because the governor weighed in.  Once the governor or the mayor weighs in on something, you're finished.  Oh, really?  We don't know anything about that.  Oh, no.  It's bad.  I wouldn't know when the mayor gets involved. 
[00:40:30]  It's very bad.  And you're finished when that happens.  Yeah.  What did Obama say that sunk somebody recently?  There was something he weighed in on.  It's like, all they have to do is weigh in a little bit, and fucking everything tips one  way.  It was a foreign affair or something, but he said one little thing, and fucking everything  just moved.  Like, it's the way it is, man.  These guys.  And the news can just get the soundbite and play it.  That's exactly it, yeah.  It becomes like, oh, boy.  We got to fucking cut this guy off.  Is kicking someone in the balls okay, though? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  You can definitely do that.  You can do that, though, right?  Good job.  This kind of fits into our little thing yesterday with Gator Country.  What's happened with them?  Are they fired?  I saw more news people picking up the story yesterday.  They're saying that they could face a felony?  Gawker picked it up.  Picked up what?  They can't face a felony.  They never said anything bad about the water supply. 
[00:41:30]  It's what Valance got.  I'll bet you that their fucking people put it out.  Are they still doing the same thing on the website?  No, the poll appears to be gone.  It was up last night.  People are keeping me updated.  How are they doing in the poll?  They're getting their asses handed to them.  The never fucking option was still way the fuck up there.  I hope that doesn't get them in.  Us?  No.  They know we're fucking with them.  They're not stupid.  Oh, they absolutely know that the poll was tainted.  They're not stupid.  They know where a lot of that shit was coming from.  Yes. 
[00:42:00]  The poll was tainted.  In this day and age.  Yeah.  See, another guy.  I had a hockey coach that called me a pussy faggot.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  I had a father that called me that.  I have a subconscious that calls me that.  There's a mirror that just yells that at me.  Steve in New Jersey.  Steve.  Yes.  Steve in New Jersey.  I was Animal House.  When the flounder throws the marbles and they're all slipping around on him.  Need of mine is like, get up, you faggots. 
[00:42:30]  Get up and fight.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a movie example, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was cool.  But it was based on how people our age were brought up.  We heard that word all the fucking time.  It's amazing.  Everything's offensive to, you know, at least somebody.  Yes, that's a movie example of a coach.  It doesn't help us at all, sir.  I mean.  All right, thank you, Steve.  But I guess the point there, though, Hollywood thought it was completely acceptable to be,  you know, throwing that word around there in a comedy. 
[00:43:00]  Because if you fucking know.  You would not hear faggot in a comedy nowadays.  No.  So I think there was a point for that call.  If you could prove that the word faggot, using the word faggot, is always against gay people  and it incites people to harm gay people, then you might have a point as to, you know,  it's dangerous language.  Ooh, look out.  But it's one of those.  It's not.  It's another one of those fake, sacred words.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Because gays throw that word around as well.  Of course.  And, you know, the same thing with the N word with black people.  It's a fake, sacred word because you just walk the streets and you hear it every other word.  Of course.  But then they try to cover by saying, no, we're saying, you know, N-I-G-G-A.  That's different.  People want to be important.  But I don't hear.  By the way, I don't hear N-I-G-G-A anymore.  I should say it louder.  Now the kids just use the N word.  And they just pepper their fucking language all day long with it.  It's a fake, sacred word. 
[00:44:00]  It's not sacred.  Turn on any fucking, put on any fucking World Star Hip Hop video.  Holy shit.  Dude, I.  Yeah, nigga.  What up, nigga?  Yeah.  Fuck you, nigga.  It's all their fucking, every other fucking word.  Around 3 o'clock, 3.30 in my neighborhood, a school that's out that is predominantly black.  Yeah.  And the kids walk around Columbus Avenue and Broadway.  You can see it for yourself.  And you will hear that word so many times within five blocks.  Yeah.  They're just talking. 
[00:44:30]  What's DJ Who Kid around there?  They're just talking.  They're not even angry.  Right, right.  That's how they talk.  Yeah.  It's a fact.  It makes you feel important if you have a word that people aren't allowed to say that is, you know, about you or you use it or it's been attached to you.  And then, yeah, nigger was such a big word like that that black people are like, oh, we don't want.  So then other groups are like, what word can we make people not say?  Right.  Because it fucking, it makes you more important. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  And if people adhere to it, then you have some kind of power over them.  So the gay community took everything.  Queer.  Faggot.  Faggot.  Quay.  Queeb.  Fairy.  Fairy.  Fairy Mary.  Sissy.  Sissy pants.  But if you could stop the public from using a word, that's a huge fucking victory for your little side.  The R word with fucking retarded people. 
[00:45:30]  Shouldn't they get with each other and go, all right, look, if we're having everyone else stop using this word, we've got to fucking set a good example here.  We've got to stop using the word ourselves.  That's the ultimate hypocrisy.  Oh, I know.  I never understood that.  Never understood that.  Yeah.  So Mike Rice, good luck to you, but I think you're fucking done.  Oh, yeah.  That rice is cooked.  Yeah, in a minute.  My high school.  Good one, Chippa.  More calls.  I'm kidding.  Chippa looked at me very strangely.  More calls coming in.  My high school coach berated his own son in front of everybody. 
[00:46:00]  The Bobby Knight recording sounds exactly like his high school coach.  This kid understands the Bobby Knight tape.  I knew a coach walked out to the fucking pitcher's mound and smacked his kid in the face for putting the ball a little too close to the kid's head.  Almost killing him.  Yeah.  What happened to that coach's head?  How was that coach's baseball hat removed from me?  Shit. 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  I guess.  Is it dumb to fucking...  Jesus.  What, the hovercraft?  Bubba Watson's hovercraft.  I thought this was an April Fool's video.  Pretty fucking funny.  I looked into it more.  This thing is real.  Bubba Watson wants to get hovercrafts on the golf course, and they got a great video.  It's all over the place.  Maybe we can put it on our Facebook page of him using a prototype.  Dude, you know how fucking loud those things are, though?  There's no way you can put it on a golf course, but the video shows him going across a little, you know, golf pond to get his ball. 
[00:47:00]  How cool would that be?  I would love it.  It's not practical, though.  It's so not practical.  They're loud as fuck, and you're not that easy to control, either.  And you're not going to get over the banks and stuff easily.  I mean, he picked a pond that was, like, very easy to get across.  Yeah.  He's the only golfer that could get away with that.  Is he rich?  They're all rich.  He's really rich, but he's...  He's one of the top players on the tour.  Yeah, he's one of the top players.  He's up there.  He owns the Dukes of Hazzard car. 
[00:47:30]  Like, he's just a goofy guy.  Ooh, why didn't he take that on the course?  And he cries a lot.  Yeah, he cries a lot.  He loves crying.  Never took a lesson.  He hits a fucking ridiculous drive.  He's awesome.  He's lefty.  Look at this hovercraft.  And it's got a golf cart-like roof on it.  Yeah, he explained that.  You sure this isn't a fake video?  This is not practical in the end.  Where is it?  Over here?  Being some of the limitations of existing golf carts.  Golf carts have looked the same.  They've been the same.  You've got to stay 30 yards from the green. 
[00:48:00]  You've got to stay on the cart path when it's raining.  But let's have fun.  Let's go through the water hazard.  Come off the other side, right by the green.  Put your ball in the hole.  And then you can drive back across the water hazard.  And who doesn't want to do that?  Bubba's idea was to see if we can incorporate a hovercraft principle that is riding on a bubbler  there into the existing golf cart.  You're riding your hovercraft.  We have to look at how we can use the existing elements such as the roof, the seat handles,  the sand bottles, all of the various pieces of our own existing golf carts.  That's how we could incorporate those into the hovercraft technology. 
[00:48:30]  You can't go through a pond and then get the grass all wet afterwards.  You know, that would mess the game up.  BW1 is a prototype.  You know, mess the game up.  Our first one out.  No bumps.  Golf cart's going to have bumps.  It takes you everywhere you want to go through sand traps, through waters, shortcuts into the  woods, out of the woods.  And my ball likes to go in and out of the woods.  So we've got to be able to get there in the best way and quickest way possible.  The big advantage of the hovercraft is it has a footprint pressure about 33 times less  than the human foot.  So by hovering across the green, you leave absolutely no trace. 
[00:49:00]  I see a lot of stares, a lot of laughs.  And then they actually see how efficient it is.  I think it's going to really get more people involved.  They're going to want to just drive the hovercraft and not play golf.  But I mean, that's how I got started, you know, driving a golf cart and then golf got in  the way.  I probably figured out where they get it on a couple of courses, but imagine playing  Crab Meadow with a hovercraft, wiping out all the geese when local there.  It's a nightmare golf course. 
[00:49:30]  There's so many fucking geese at Crab Meadow and their duties.  You're hitting more fucking goose shit than balls.  Bulls.  That's Crab Meadow.  Yeah.  What do you think of the hovercraft?  Well, they are cool as fuck, but you know, he's probably been driving that thing around  a while.  If you don't know what you're doing in a hovercraft, you'll just fucking slide out somewhere, slam  it to a tree, slam sideways into a tree, you know, there's a hovercraft is like a fucking 
[00:50:00]  it's like you ever play air hockey.  It's like the puck.  Look, there's no real, you're not getting definite definitive control on a hovercraft.  If you're going forward really fast in order to stop a lot of times, you got to spin the  thing around and give it like forward thrust when you're going backwards.  Right.  So it's very difficult to, you can't just turn, you need a lot of room to make a turn 
[00:50:30]  because it just slides.  It's like you're on ice.  And I'm sure they have lawyers in that industry.  Oh yeah.  They'll shut them down.  Like, look, this is not practical.  It's just them being silly.  You're looking at a lot of lawsuits.  He's being silly with that thing.  You think?  That's what he's doing.  Indeed.  Maybe it's an April Fool's fucking joke.  Maybe.  You think it is?  Yeah.  I mean, it's cool, but I don't see that being practical at all.  Yeah.  I think Bubba's just having some fun.  Are there people out there?  It was put up on April 2nd. 
[00:51:00]  I know.  Oh.  Perfect time to do an April Fool's joke.  Right?  The worst possible time to do an April Fool's joke.  I disagree.  But maybe he's like, look, let everyone else have April Fool's.  Yeah, he's a prankster.  I have April 2nd for my April Fool's.  Yeah, he's just calling his a prank.  When was Bubba's Hover account created?  Oh, boy.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  No.  But it's in connection with Oakley.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe Oakley's in on it.  Anyone else see the Conrad Murray interview that Anderson Cooper did last night?  Oh, God.  What was that about?  Yes, I laughed my balls off.  Did you watch the whole interview?  Yeah.  Conrad Murray is nuts.  He's a crazy person.  Do we have highlight clips of that?  I can get you the video of it.  Well, it was long.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Maybe get a few clips.  I don't know.  I guess we'll figure it out.  But near the end of the interview, Conrad Murray decided to sing.  What?  To describe his life, I think? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Anderson Cooper asked him a question.  And then Conrad Murray wanted people to know how he had been raised and grown up.  And so he started singing.  Started singing.  And Anderson Cooper started, like, you know, broke out of the news roll and started kind  of rolling his eyes and going, what the fuck's going on over here?  Fucking lunatic.  That was Michael Jackson's doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He cocked his head like a dog.  Yeah.  Cocked.  He truly believes he was just helping out Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  I've listened to some clips of him crying in prison. 
[00:52:30]  It's pretty funny.  He's out of his mind.  Yeah.  He gets on the phone and he calls people up and leaves messages on their answering machine  like, hey, you've got to help me get out of here.  Really?  Yeah.  He's crying.  Sorry.  It'd be hilarious.  And then they share the messages with everybody.  Yeah.  And then people share the messages.  Did he go to prison with two bad knees or?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I'm 18 years ago.  I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees. 
[00:53:00]  What else?  I dreamed to become a Major League Baseball player.  Oh, never heard from him again.  Oh, very nice.  Hold on.  Before we go to the Conrad Murray.  Basketballs at players' legs, even their heads.  Grabbing, pushing, kicking, and punching them.  Sounds like ass, man.  And screaming homophobic slurs.  Oh. 
[00:53:30]  This video, obtained by ESPN's Outside the Lines, shows Rutgers head basketball coach  Mike Rice going off the handle and abusing his players during practices from 2010 through  2012, according to the Sports Network.  The footage surfaced after Eric Murdoch, who was Rice's director of player development  until he was fired, showed it to Rutgers athletic department officials.  In an interview with ESPN, Murdoch says the abuse caused several players to leave. 
[00:54:00]  To see your coach physically putting his hands on players, physically kicking players, you  know, firing balls at players from point-blank range, the verbal abuse, the belittling, yeah,  I was like in total shock that this guy wasn't fired immediately on the spot.  On ESPN Tuesday, the school's athletic director was asked why he didn't fire Rice. 
[00:54:30]  The moment that we became aware of the video in November, when it was presented to us by  Eric and his lawyers, we immediately commenced an independent investigation into the matter.  We talked to everybody in the program.  We evaluated the situation and we suspended Mike in a more significant way than coaches  have been suspended in recent memory.  Now as this video goes viral, many calling on him to reconsider and fire Rice.  Even LeVron James weighing in on Twitter saying,  if my son played for Rutgers or a coach like that, he would have some real explaining to 
[00:55:00]  do and I'm still going to whoop on him afterwards.  Come on.  Seeing basketball coaches lose their cool is nothing new.  Remember legendary coach Bobby Knight?  He was known for his hot temper and throwing chairs, but it was this video showing him with  his hands around a player's neck that led to his dismissal at Indiana.  I mean, maybe I grabbed Neil Reed by the shoulder.  Maybe I took him by the back of the neck.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't remember everything that I've ever done in practice. 
[00:55:30]  Now the question looms.  Will Rice face the same thing?  Yes.  He's so fired.  Yeah.  What bothers me is that Eric Guy.  Yeah.  He showed the tapes after he got fired.  After he was fired.  So he completely accepted the behavior while he was in good standard with the coach and  the program.  Then he gets fired for whatever fucking reason and then goes, oh, really?  Well, look what I do now.  Yeah.  And takes the tapes to the school.  Look at me now.  If you had a problem while you actually had the gig, maybe you should have stepped forward. 
[00:56:00]  That's way braver.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Whatever.  I know it's tough to fucking defend, but.  And now they're over here, too.  Over here now.  It's everywhere.  He's finished.  Yeah, he's finished.  So done.  It's on all the channels.  Yeah.  There's nothing else going on.  That's bad.  You gotta yell different stuff.  Make a basket.  Oh, you think that would have been a good one?  Dribble, dribble, dribble, shoot.  Imagine if that's all he yelled. 
[00:56:30]  Dribble, dribble, dribble, shoot.  All right.  Well, when we take our first break, when we get back, we can play Conrad Murray.  We sing it.  Oh, yeah.  On Anderson Cooper.  It was really, really strange TV.  This video will be everywhere today as well.  And I want to hear him crying in prison.  I haven't heard those yet.  Oh, yeah.  We'll find that.  Can we find one or two of those?  Yeah.  And what else, Sam?  You guys have a surprise after the break.  A surprise?  For the show.  As you laugh.  I like surprises. 
[00:57:00]  Do you?  Yep.  Me, too.  No hints?  No.  Who does it involve?  I just said no hints.  Did you film What's-Her-Name or did the company film her?  Who?  Michelle.  What's-her-name?  I did.  Yeah.  Michelle Beadle?  Yeah.  And did they push that video out?  No.  They didn't even.  Oh, boy.  No.  Yeah, we got a...  Sam got some good attention.  He had Michelle Beadle in.  I always forget her name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She used to be on Sports Nation.  Where is she now?  She's on NBC Sports Network. 
[00:57:30]  And she does a very good job.  I've always liked her and she's kind of hot.  Yeah, she's great.  I stared at her nose because I think something's going on there, but you're telling me the  nose is fine in person or something.  Right.  But you filmed her.  Yeah.  And she fucking gave Erin Andrews.  They have history, right?  Yeah, I guess.  I kind of stumbled upon that.  And basically, you asked her about Erin Andrews indirectly or whatever.  It got to that point.  And then Michelle, on camera, basically gives the...  And gives the thumbs down.  Yeah.  And they're eating it up out there. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, a lot of sports blogs picked that up.  A lot of places have picked that up because that is a big fucking deal.  But no one from this place asked you about it or pushed it out?  No, and I didn't bring it to their attention either.  No, but there's certain things that are happening that they should know.  They should follow along.  I mean, it's fucking...  You know what I say?  Rawr, cat fight.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but the sports blogs picked it up.  It's pretty big.  Yeah.  It's pretty big.  I just was wondering how it got out there. 
[00:58:30]  And I already knew the answer.  I was just trying to turn the screws and make it hurt a little bit today.  Yeah, yeah.  Radio Wizard had nothing to do with it or anything?  No, no.  Nothing.  Has he come to you since it made all the sports blogs?  No, because it made it all last night and yesterday afternoon and stuff.  Yeah, but then at the very least, they should take that and maybe even push it more forward.  No?  No, a lot of fucking shaking of heads.  All right.  Well, good for you, though.  Did she look good?  Yeah.  She's sexy, man.  Fucking Michelle Fiedel is really cute.  Really sexy, man. 
[00:59:00]  Just for one second.  But what I'm talking about is a systematic, we've got this systematic ideal in sport where  What are you talking about?  Sport is not subject to the rules of the rest of society.  I often tell parents who are watching their son or daughter be abused on a sideline, verbally, usually, hopefully.  Would you, if that was a French teacher, if that was a maths teacher in your kid's school, would you allow that kind of behavior?  So should he be fired?  So should he be fired?  Oh, it's character building.  John, we know he was suspended for those three games.  Exactly.  Exactly right. 
[00:59:30]  Should he be fired?  He should be fired.  There is no context in the universe where that kind of behavior is acceptable.  It's physical and verbal abuse.  It's psychological and emotional abuse.  No, he should not be allowed near anybody.  I mean, forget sports.  There is no context where his management style is appropriate.  Yeah, well, anyway.  We appreciate it.  John Moore to me this morning.  How about the military in some way, shapes, or forms?  Old school. 
[01:00:00]  The nom.  What about that?  There's so much psychological shit.  Oh, here we go again.  That goes down.  On ESPN, and we've got this this morning.  I mean, what do you think about the way he's manhandling these players?  Coach?  Coach Lou Holtz.  We might have lost the audio of the questions.  I don't know if we extended ourselves.  Can you hear us, Coach?  Howard Stern's penis.  Coach, if you can hear us, not.  You can't see him.  You've got to listen to Lou Holtz talk.  All right, so let's just bring you up to date on the story. 
[01:00:30]  The coach at Rutgers basketball, yeah, Rutgers basketball once again, in the news.  Can you hear us, Coach?  Oh, boy.  One of those, Garnt.  Okay, anyway, so the coach under fire.  Bobby Knight was fired for that.  He got physical.  Oh, he's done.  He's got physical.  He's got anti-gay sports.  Absolutely finished.  Yeah.  But physically was pushing the...  I don't know.  Just psychological shit has always been...  Oh, here he is.  Yeah, what do you think about that?  Listen to Lou Holtz talk.  Well, I think you should not put hands on an athlete, but let me say this.  You know, I grabbed a guy by the face mask once because he did something that was completely 
[01:01:00]  illegal.  But also, I believe if somebody puts hands on an athlete today, we know that's a no-no.  But you also have to look at the relationship that coach has.  All we look at is one little segment.  What about the other things he does in the office?  Does he have a positive impact on the athlete?  Are they reacting positively to him?  That is a question.  I don't think you can just evaluate one little thing and say, okay, that's a no-no.  I think you've got like 12 different incidents here, though. 
[01:01:30]  And whipping a ball at someone's groin usually doesn't make them grow as a person.  Pro-noun trouble.  No, I'm not defending that at all whatsoever.  But I am saying this.  As a coach, you should never do anything physically with an athlete.  Lay your hands on him, et cetera.  I grabbed the face mask because I wanted to have her undivided attention, wanted to be  able to look him in the eye.  But you have to look also about the predominant thing that coaches develop at individual, and  you don't do it by demeaning them.  You must criticize their performance. 
[01:02:00]  You never criticize a performer, and that is a big difference in education and raising  children.  Remember this also.  Why is he talking?  When people need love and understanding the most is usually when they deserve it the least.  But what the Rutgers coach did was totally uncalled for.  How come from what you're smug with, as long as I'm rich.  Well, I think it has to be a decision made by the university.  I think they have to talk to the athletes and find out their relationship.  Are they getting better?  Are they developing?  How they're doing academically better?  But you have to have policies. 
[01:02:30]  You have to set a precedent on it.  That's a decision they have to make.  I don't know all the facts, but I will tell you this.  That is totally unacceptable by my standpoint.  All right.  Yeah, he's not right.  Has he always talked like that?  Thanks so much.  For a long time.  Wow.  He's a commentator, too.  That's something.  Why?  He's got a fucking horrible mush mouth.  He's on almost every week.  Could you stop eating sponges before you talk?  Yeah.  Lou, finish your sponges before you open your mouth.  Yeah, Lou, we all got together, and your sponging is really interfering. 
[01:03:00]  Your new program of tongue sponging is interfering with your ability to be a good announcer.  He's terrible.  He's on every week during college football season.  Oh, God.  We've been laughing at his voice for years.  Damn, is that bad?  Yeah, there's all sorts of shit going on there.  There's my fucking surprise.  It's coming.  Get my fucking surprise.  What, Sam?  Sam?  Yeah.  You can go to break if you want.  Yeah.  But I don't think I can let you go to the bathroom. 
[01:03:30]  So.  How much time do we have to sit here?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Regular break.  Regular break.  I can sit here.  I can sit.  You can't.  You can't yet.  If this sucks or is intrusive to the program.  Then have Jim blindfold Jimmy and get him out of here and back in.  Maybe Jim can go to the bathroom right now.  I'd rather Jim wait for a few minutes.  Okay.  You will be able to go to the bathroom at some point during the break.  I'll make sure of that.  Because I don't want to upset your bladder.  No, you don't want to break the surprise. 
[01:04:00]  What they're doing is one of the staff members is going to hang himself on the air.  And they're hooking up the noose.  Right.  And they know if I see them strengthening the boards up, they'll know who it is.  Since we have no visual element, Jim pointed right at me.  Of course.  No, I was pointing up at the ceiling, actually.  With a little elephant.  This is the Opianity Channel.  What's Sirius XM? 
[01:04:30]  Next week on a very special Opianity Show.  The guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  I've just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  Might be sensitive here.  What?  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking? 
[01:05:00]  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Or now it's the Opianity and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fucking!  Where's Gary?  Fuck him.  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man. 
[01:05:30]  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week on a very special Opianity Show.  Fuck you, I'm fine.  The Opianity Show.  Can't touch this.  What's up?  This is MC Hammer.  And you're listening to the Opianity and Anthony Show.  Oh, Anthony.  All right, Hammer.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Have a go.  Have a time. 
[01:06:00]  We did our show once, had a good time, and never came back.  Yep.  MC Hammer filed for bankruptcy 17 years ago.  Wow.  And that Unabomber guy, Kaczynski.  Yeah.  That's already 17 years ago that he was arrested.  He had a manifesto.  He had a manifesto.  Yeah, he was like, yeah.  Should have worked at it until a rap song.  Manifesto.  He was the first one that really got his manifesto out there.  I think Jodi Arias is much hotter as a blonde. 
[01:06:30]  I just want to say that.  Who?  Jodi.  Who is she?  She's the one that stabbed the shit out of her fucking boyfriend.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That lunatic.  She's got a nice set of tits on her is what she's got.  Or did she, no, she shot him a lot, right?  Stabbed him.  I think she stabbed and then shot him.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was very angry.  And she's a creepy liar, they're all saying.  Oh, she's a big fucking liar.  But she was way hotter as a blonde.  Maybe she dyed her hair to make herself look a little, you know, more proper for her court case. 
[01:07:00]  That's what they do.  They're all wild.  And then they tame it down for their court appearance.  Well, we're sitting here.  We have the curtains closed.  Yeah, the curtains are closed.  And we're not watching porno, so something's up.  And Sam told us something's up.  There's a little surprise that's about to happen.  The surprise is on its way.  I don't know why.  I'm thinking it's some kind of guest.  I'm thinking it's somebody that we've all kind of talked about.  Why would they just pitch a guest to us, though?  Because it's not pitch-worthy. 
[01:07:30]  They know it's a yes, and they know it's not pitch-worthy.  That's a bold statement.  That's really...  Can you turn on mic seven, please?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Are they going outside with the mic?  I just need mic seven.  Wow, they're really...  When Travis wants mic seven...  Thank you.  Hold on, Sam.  Before the big surprise.  Could we pull a mic outside the studio?  Roland is the big surprise?  Yes, he is.  By the door.  Sam, what's going on?  Hold on.  Roland's hard to get a hold on.  Hold on.  If Roland's here, that means it's a guest.  Okay.  Hang on.  You ready? 
[01:08:00]  Hang on, Roland.  All right.  Are you ready?  Come on.  Obi?  I'm trying to read your face.  How goofy is this?  I'm just asking if you're ready.  I think you were right, by the way.  I still think you were right.  And that means he's a great actor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anthony, are you ready?  Can I say what I think?  No.  No.  No.  You're just...  Don't try.  Don't peek.  Oh, there's a film crew.  Don't peek.  Film crew, too.  Don't peek.  Jim, are you ready?  I am.  So everybody's ready?  Yeah.  All right.  I told Ed who I think he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then, Eric, hit the music. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, man.  He's dancing his way in.  He's lotioning up.  This is fantastic.  Oh, my God.  It's him.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy's putting some lotion on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jimmy.  Hold on.  This is...  Oh, that's fantastic.  Jimmy, can you do that again? 
[01:09:00]  Come on.  Easy.  Come on.  Easy.  Easy.  What are you doing?  Oh, wow.  Jimmy's oiling him down.  Oiling.  Thank you.  This is fantastic.  Look at the wonderful sequin vest.  Jimmy, you want to get his abs?  Oh, get his back off.  Oh, he threw his sequin vest at me.  I'm honored.  Jimmy is really getting into lotioning up.  He needs to be lotioned.  What?  What?  What?  What's your name?  Uh, Jim, sir. 
[01:09:30]  Okay, no.  What's my name?  Fandango.  Oh.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fandango.  Fandango.  You need...  Johnny.  You need to feel it, Johnny, okay?  It's...  Fandango.  Knocked the lotion over.  He knocked over.  Don't get nervous, okay?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'll try it again.  Try it again. 
[01:10:00]  Fandango.  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  That's pretty good.  Jacob.  Jacob.  You gotta...  You gotta feel it.  You gotta let the ace breathe.  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  Try it.  It's your microphone. 
[01:10:30]  All right, go ahead.  Fandango.  He's already shaking his head no.  Come on, Jimmy.  No?  Not good enough?  What did I do wrong?  I will not come  to this Mickey Mouse outfit of a show, okay?  Oh, man.  He's got that right.  Johnny?  Yes, Johnny.  You just cost everybody here  and all, you know,  the hundreds and thousands of listeners 
[01:11:00]  across the world  the chance to hear the debut  of Fandango.  Curly?  Is this what we're gonna do?  Is this what we're gonna do?  Curly?  Sunday?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Whoa.  These are real.  The real deal.  These are real.  How many?  Four.  Four.  Figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Decide who wants to come. 
[01:11:30]  Tickets.  Whoa.  WrestleMania just fell down your desk.  Whoa.  WrestleMania tickets.  Everything that goes down there is mine.  You can see the real debut of...  Oh, of?  Uh-oh.  Everybody.  Everybody in the room.  Here we go.  Yeah, yeah.  Fandango.  And there he is.  Wow.  And there he goes.  He's leaving.  There's the music.  The dance. 
[01:12:00]  What?  I'm honored.  And now he's...  And he's gone.  That's it.  There he goes.  Strutting out.  That is wonderful.  I love it.  Fandango.  Look at this.  Whoa.  That is something right there.  All right.  That was cool and all.  Does he come back in now for an interview or no?  No.  No, that was it.  Oh, nice.  We are going to WrestleMania, people. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  That's what you get.  We don't get the real interview now.  Real?  You didn't say his name right.  No, I thought Jimmy did a pretty good job.  I thought Jimmy did very well also.  I thought Jimmy did a great job.  I think he's using that as an excuse to not wrestle.  Right.  You know, I don't know if anyone's brought this up, but I think he's using it as an excuse  to not wrestle.  Look, Jim did a pretty good job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't make it right. 
[01:13:00]  That makes it pretty good.  And that's not what...  He did it perfectly.  He did it perfectly.  He let the A's breathe and everything.  I'm starting to think that he doesn't want to wrestle.  I'm thinking he doesn't want to wrestle.  He doesn't want to wrestle.  Well, we'll see him with Chris Jericho on Sunday, won't we?  And what do you think will happen?  I think Chris Jericho has his work cut out for him, quite frankly.  Oh, stop it.  Jericho's a troll.  Jericho's a troll.  Does it?  Jimmy was lotioning.  I was lotioning Fandango.  You really were.  You really enjoyed that.  But this is what bothers me about myself.  At one point, I actually threw my headphones off so I could lotion the man properly. 
[01:13:30]  I think he's wearing underpants.  I wanted to lotion the man properly.  Chris Jericho never cared how his name was said before he got in the ring.  Right.  I think Fandango has a problem.  Did I do good?  Yeah, at one point he called you Jacob.  Yeah, and he called me Johnny.  Johnny.  He's not good with names.  You don't think I did it well?  He did it...  I told them, you did it very good.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  You didn't do it right.  Fandango.  What a great cop-out excuse this guy has.  It really is a cop-out.  For not getting in the ring and mixing it up.  He just gets in there and says, you know, you didn't say my name right.  I'm leaving.  I'll be honest.  I felt those guns.  He's ready to wrestle.  I have lotioned the man up.  He's in fine physical shape.  He really was a fine specimen of manhood.  Yeah, he really was.  He's definitely not...  He's prepared to get into the ring.  Yeah?  Sure. 
[01:14:30]  I can feel that, yeah.  I guess we'll find out Sunday.  And I've tussled with Jericho as well.  We shot something together where I had to throw him.  He fell to the ground and I had to jump on him.  So what do you think?  Yeah, who are you going to be?  You're going to be at WrestleMania.  You got the tickets now.  Yeah.  Well, hard to say.  I mean, I have to go with Jericho because he's a friend of mine.  Yeah, but you never lotioned him.  That is true, despite many requests via email.  Right.  Well, the WWE is asking if you'll take a break so they can film your reactions to Fandango. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, well.  Sure, of course.  That was a great surprise.  I nailed it, by the way.  I nailed it.  He did.  I nailed it.  Right beforehand.  I never would have guessed it.  I'll be guessed.  And fucking Oscar winning Travis.  Yeah, because I go, Travis, I know what's going on.  And I said, he goes, nah.  That was good, Travis.  Thank you.  You got me.  Yeah, it was very subtle.  You just went like, nah.  Like, don't even think that.  I laughed so hard, I'm crying.  That is such a great fucking bit.  That music.  Yeah.  That's why you couldn't go to the bathroom.  Because even though when he showed up, he was wearing sweatpants, his sequin tights 
[01:15:30]  were popping out through the bottoms.  You have this video of me lotioning.  I'm uploading a quick video from my phone of Jimmy lotioning up Fandango.  It was funny.  It was going to be available on my YouTube channel in a few minutes.  He kept saying, go with the grain.  Go with the grain.  Eric says he's just strutting up and down the hallways.  He keeps walking back and forth.  Yeah, he's great.  He's fucking great.  All right, we got to go back to break.  Yeah.  We'll be back.  Stay there. 
[01:16:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  Ahoy, mateys!  Time to launch back onto the seven seas with your favorite aqua adventurer, Captain Louie!  It was my first day in the boat.  I just bought it.  But it's this big fucking boat with two engines, and it's really complicated to drive. 
[01:16:30]  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it.  We went out to the Statue of Liberty, and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing, and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like, you know, like a big round raft.  That's what it looked like to me.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed.  And Chris goes, get the fuck away from that thing.  Like it was creepy.  So I backed away from it, and I put a light on it, and it was, it was like, it looked like 
[01:17:00]  a giant manhole cover sticking out of the river.  This was the weirdest night fucking ever.  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty, and it's like, I don't know, 20 feet across,  and it's moving.  It's leaving a wake.  So I call up, and then this woman came on and says, New York Harbor Coast Guard, give  me your phone number.  So I give her my number, and this guy calls.  He goes, describe it as well as you can.  I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine, and  it's headed towards Lower Manhattan.  That's what I'm seeing, and I'm sure it's not that, but my main concern is it's not lit, 
[01:17:30]  and it could cream anything that hits it's going down.  And the guy goes, all right, well, I'll call the boat and send them to you.  So he hangs up, and like 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  So anyway, I call back, and they're not sending anybody, and I, and I, at one point, I got  crazy, and I was like, you are the Coast Guard, and I am saying to you now, there's a submarine  attacking Lower Manhattan.  I'm saying it.  And they're like, ah, we're trying to get park police over here.  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  And he kept asking me to hover.  We kept hovering around it and stuff, and then finally this big police boat comes and shines 
[01:18:00]  like a massive light on it, and then he calls me on the radio.  Hey, Captain, are you the one who, uh, reported this?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  You just hang, hook up to it.  And I go, what if you don't see it?  And the guy goes, well, most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing.  I have no business being on the water, and I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at  the Statue of Liberty to show it off to Chris and them. 
[01:18:30]  Arrgh!  Ha ha!  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for.  Well, shiver me timbers and all that bullshit.  Ah, pigleg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  Laugh your tears away!

[01:22:00]  And obviously the fans basically saying if ever you guys needed a visual element  Just making our point over and over again  Yeah  Sam and Roland and the gang  Set up the Fandango  Fandang  I figured it out by the way  You gotta do the G twice  Fandango  You said it that way too by the way 
[01:22:30]  If you would have done that  We did  You probably would have  We said his name perfectly  He doesn't want to wrestle  I'm not fooling around with this shit anymore  The guy doesn't want to wrestle  If you had said his name right  He would have stuck around and done an interview  I feel like I chased him out  Because when I said go  I thought I did really well  And then he left  I felt like I ruined everything  You did it a little wrong  I think he was fooling with you too  He said  You got the go right  And I'm like  Oh finally  Someone at least got part of it right  And he said  And that's what I'm going to do  Go  And he left  I knew when you said we had a surprise  It was somebody kind of quirky 
[01:23:00]  That we've been kind of talking about lately  That was great  Was it a stretch though  That it was somebody that had to do with wrestling  Yeah right  That was hilarious  And then we just filmed something for WWE.com  We'll see if that makes it up there  It'll go up there  They were excited about it  They are  Yeah and Joe Vila  Our guy over there  Helped set it up  But yeah I was worried yesterday  Because Michael Cole  You know he did the after show  And you guys passed him in the hall  But he talked to Opie a little bit 
[01:23:30]  And he had just found out  That this was happening  But I didn't know if he  Like I told him it was a surprise  Right  But when he ran into you  He goes  You brought up Fandango  As soon as you saw him  Oh yeah  I'm like  I'm in again  Because I haven't really  I really haven't watched wrestling  In a while  I keep tabs on our guys  That we like  Like CM Punk  And Chris Jericho  The guys  Mick Foley  When he does his thing  Every once in a while  You know the guys  That have been really good to us  Over the years  Yeah  But in general  I'm not a regular viewer  But the Fandango thing 
[01:24:00]  Has got me back  Yeah it's just hilarious  It's such a ridiculous gimmick  But like Cole  Cole goes  You said  Yeah  We're all on with this Fandango thing  Right  And then Cole goes  Yeah I heard you guys  And I go  Oh shit  He's gonna blow it  And then he goes  We're talking about him  I heard you guys  Are gonna have him  Right  What does Mike Cole do?  He's the lead announcer  Oh yeah  He's the commentator  Yeah he does a very good job  He's been there for a long time now  He's the voice of the company 
[01:24:30]  I gotta say  During the break  We got to meet him  And for real  We got to meet the man  That plays Fandango  And he wants it known  I don't think I've blown up his spot  That he's a man  Yeah he's definitely a guy  It was hilarious  How he wanted to make sure  Every guy he talks to  Oh yeah  Knows that this is  His  Oh yeah  His gimmick  I'm not giving anything away  He wants you to know  Look dude  Looks a little weird  But I am a man  He didn't say that 
[01:25:00]  But he indicated  He's just a guy  Right  He's a fucking dude  He wanted to make sure  You knew that  And then he's talking about  His father  Who's a truck driver  He's like  So now you're Fandango  Right  His father writes him  Yeah  What are you gonna do  What are you gonna do  And um  I love it though  It's uh  We're all in  It's hilarious  Oh yeah  That was very  That was an honor  Getting our Wrestlemania tickets  Yeah  From Fandango  He's not doing any other press  No  He is a very entertaining guy  I'll say that  I'm looking forward to this 
[01:25:30]  I don't  I've never been to a Wrestlemania  This is gonna be a lot of fun  For all of us  Especially all the guys  We've interviewed  We've interviewed almost everybody  On the card  Now we're  Now we're being told  We want to take the hotline  So uh  Who's on the hotline  Hey nerds  Nerds  Oh  Oh yeah  It's Fandango  Listen up  I'm gonna give you  One more  One more  Hey  Hey  Oh yeah  Yeah  I'm gonna give you  One more opportunity  To get my name right 
[01:26:00]  Here we go  Okay  Alright  Try it again  Try it again  Fandango  He hung up on me  He just hung up on me  He hung up on me  It's like we're 12 years old today  The gimmick is fantastic  I know  And there's a part  I really want to get it right  I want to be the special boy  We all got it right  He finally gets it right  Every single one of us got it right 
[01:26:30]  His entrance for Wrestlemania  Is gonna be ridiculous  It's gonna be fucking ridiculous  So over the top  Right  He did a run in  On Monday  Like he just interrupted  Somebody's match  Of course  And even when he was just  Interrupting a match  They brought down his  Big gold sequined curtain  And played his music  And  What  He did it on Monday  You guys would've laughed  Now  You know how he's doing  The dancing thing  Yeah  He went out while  Chris Jericho was wrestling  And every time  Chris Jericho did a move  He held up a number  That was low  Like he held up  Like a three  Or a two 
[01:27:00]  Or a zero  Such a great gimmick  I'll bet you they asked him  To be dancing with the stars though  I bet he does something like  Have they had anybody  From wrestling  Actually  Jericho  Yeah  They had Jericho  Yeah  Now Sam  You know a lot about wrestling  Obviously  Does he wrestle at Wrestlemania  Cause the whole gimmick  That is  That he's not wrestling  Because no one gets his name right  So now what do they do  For Wrestlemania  And you got Chris Jericho  Chris Jericho  Wants to wrestle at Wrestlemania  Here's my theory  Cause they gotta keep  This heat on him  Cause right now  He's getting  More booze 
[01:27:30]  Than almost anybody  In the company  Right  So I think the only way  If he keeps not wrestling  Eventually the crowd  Will start  Kind of liking him  Like we do  I think  That he has to  Go to Wrestlemania  And wrestle  But like  Beat Chris Jericho  Quickly  In a really cheap way  And just get everybody  Picked  Cause everybody loves Jericho  That would get him  Yeah  That would get people  Very angry  Yeah  I think it makes sense  For business  For him to beat Chris  Is Chris the champion?  No  Okay 
[01:28:00]  But he's you know  He's one of the main guys  But yeah  I mean I think  But if he wrestles  But he has to do  That takes a lot  Of the heat away  Maybe you have to  Beat him  But cheaply  Like you said  Not even in a chair  Really not  Unsatisfying matches  You know what I mean  He runs in  Or maybe it's not  An official match  Cause they don't do it  In the ring  No he's gotta  Get the victory  Right  Cause that's what  Will really piss people off  But he runs in  And just like  Does something  Very underhanded  He's not gonna run in  Yeah  Cause you're gonna have  The whole drawn out entrance  That's true  The entrance has to be  Longer than the match  Than the match 
[01:28:30]  Oh yeah of course  Yes  So you got like a  Maybe a ten minute entrance  And then maybe a  Thirty second match  I think you're onto  Some cheap way  Yeah  Where like he rolls him up  Or something  And then you can attack him  After the match  Or something like that  But that's  Wow they're in a weird spot  They gotta play this perfectly  New York loves Chris Jericho  So if Jericho loses  To somebody like that  Who's coming out  In sequined tights  And not wrestling  And dancing  In New York  So he obviously wins  But it's the way he wins  Is important here  He's gotta be quick and cheap  I bet he does the 
[01:29:00]  Fucking knee walk  After too  Why would he do the  Knee walk  The best wrestling  Finishing move  You know who you're gonna  Get to see at Wrestlemania  Bob Macklin  Oh good  What  I just wanna tell you  I'm wrestling hard Vince  You know I'm doing  The best I can  I just wanna be  A new champion Vince  Bob Macklin's being  Inducted into the  Hall of Fame  So they draw out  They bring out  The Hall of Fame class  Uh huh  At Wrestlemania  And  Well  Backlin's gonna be there  Wow  Of course right  Um  Why wouldn't it be  Because we don't have  A visual element 
[01:29:30]  I will tell you this  I got a quick  Cell phone video  Of Jimmy  Lotioning up  Fandango  And us trying to  Say his name properly  And uh  I think Ant's got video  He's gonna upload  Yeah I didn't  The web team  Will have a video  There's some really  Funny pictures of me  Lotioning up his back  Yeah  I didn't edit it  I didn't edit mine  I just decided  To throw it up there  But I think we'll have  A much better video  Later today  But if you wanna  At least get a quick  Peek  It's uh  I'll tweet it  But it's on my  YouTube channel  It'll be radio  Yeah I think  Let me see  Let me see if mine's  Up here

[01:32:00]  Yeah  It's a Vince  Original idea  So we're going  Full force  On this one  Oh yeah  Fucking plowing  Ahead  Dude I  I don't get  That excited  Usually  I was laughing  So fucking hard  When that door  Opened  With the music  And everything  In full  I was crying  I was doing  Sam Roberts  I was crying  I was laughing  So hard  Good  Fuck yeah  Yeah he went  All in  Yeah  Yeah  I'll tell you  That's a fucking  That is a very  Funny gimmick  It is right  Yeah I could  I never watched  I don't think  You were in at first

[01:36:00]  Paul Bearer  Who actually died  And then CM Punk  Is fooling around  With his ashes  Obviously it's not  His real ashes  But whatever  We'll play along  And we said at one point  He would do something  Ridiculous with the ashes  And I guess he finally  Did it last night  On Monday  He did what you  Both things that you guys said  Number one  He poured the ashes  On top of the Undertaker  Oh  And number two  He had Paul Heyman  Dress up as Paul Bearer  Oh okay  So they had the fake  Paul Bearer  How did Heyman do  As Paul Bearer  Great  Did he 
[01:36:30]  Heyman's a fan of our show  So we gotta get him on  You got a clip of this  Let me see  I sure would like to see  What he looks like  Absolutely  Oh my god  Oh yeah this is great  Alright  Is it long though  Just  We'll skip through it  Is that the Undertaker  Yeah  Didn't he not talk  For a long time  Yeah and he seldom talks now  Walking down the street  The fuck is that  I don't know  But it would be  Pretty creepy  Fucking dinosaur  That's our block  That's our dinosaur  Yeah  That's not real 
[01:37:00]  That'd be great  If it was  And just started  Ripping this person apart  Yeah there's a lady  With a fucking awful  Janet Reno hairdo  Looking at it  Yeah of course  It looks out of proportion  Doesn't it  Yeah it doesn't look like  A Tyrannosaurus Rex  It looks fat  No it's supposed to be  It looks a little too fat  Huh  No it's a T-Rex  No  It is  It's not  It's like an Allosaurus  An Allosaurus  Yeah  How about an  Amerannosaurus  How about an  Alice Cooper  Right  Good right Sammy  No  Very good 
[01:37:30]  Let's see some of this  Alright  I want to see  How it looks  Alright so the Undertaker  Is in the middle of a promo  Talking about how he's  Going to beat up  You know  Punk  Of course  Beat up Punk  Oh boy  There you go  Alright  Yeah move forward  Move forward  So the Druids come out  This is the Undertaker's shit  Right  Yeah  But the Undertaker's in the ring  What  What  So what does that mean  Oh my god  The Undertaker's all confused 
[01:38:00]  Oh  They come out with their torches  Looks like a fire hazard  By the way  Yeah I would imagine  Got like fucking  Big flaming torches  I know  Why is there smoke on a video screen  And not in the building  Yeah really  I'll bet you that they couldn't get  The fucking smoke alarms  Turned off like we couldn't either  Alright  So the Druids are all coming out  Like an Undertaker entrance  Undertaker's already in the ring  He's going  What the fuck  He's like  What's happening here  What's going on  And then  Oh boy 
[01:38:30]  Why would the Undertaker  Stand there and just take this shit  Yeah  He should know  Something's up  Right  After every fucking time  Shit like this happens  Something's up  Why just stand there  Wouldn't you just go  I'm not going to take this shit  Yeah I'm not fucking  I'm going to leave  I want to see how this plays out  Why  Let me take a look  Right  This could be good  Oh yeah  It's Paul Bearer's  Oh yes  That's the actual clip 
[01:39:00]  Of him saying it  There it is  Oh wow  Oh my god  He's  He  The Undertaker's horrified  He's fucking pissed  That they actually have a  A Paul Bearer  He fucking does a good Paul Bearer  He does a good job  So there's the Undertaker  He marches toward him  CM Punk is dressed as a druid  So he  He jumps the Undertaker  It's CM Punk  I see it  Oh my god 
[01:39:30]  Alright  He lays out the Undertaker  Now the Undertaker's on the ground  He's hitting him with the iron  He's beating him with the man's ashes  Yes  He's  Beating him with his  Fucking friend's ashes  Oh no  He's hitting him with the  The ashes  CM Punk has a tough time  Being a heel  Because he's too cool  Yeah  But people love the Undertaker  They do  Yeah  Oh he's been there so long  You know  So he's beating him with the iron  Right 
[01:40:00]  He takes his shirt off  Uh oh  Okay  He needs business  Oh no  He opens up  Opening the iron  Oh no  Hits him again with the iron  Can he not get it open?  Oh wait  There he goes  He's unscrewing the top  All right  Such a sick story line  The guy  The guy's really dead  This is crazy  Now he's open  Oh no  And there's the  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Supposedly Paul Bearer's ashes  Obviously not 
[01:40:30]  But whatever  I think there was ashes  And  I do too  Yeah they probably are  He's probably like  Alright so he's pouring out the ashes  This would be a tribute  And then what's he gonna do  Oh no  He's gonna throw him in the Undertaker's face  He's gonna throw him in his face  Oh  And then dumps the rest of them all over  All over the Undertaker  Oh my god  Such a great storyline too  Oh  Crab didn't like that as much  No  No  He sucked  They were a little disturbed by that 
[01:41:00]  They're horrified  Paul Bearer's ashes are covering the Undertaker  Oh that's not very nice  With fake Paul Bearer in the background  Looking on  Yeah  CM Punk now mocking the Undertaker  Oh wow  Punk  Who do you think is gonna win that match?  So terrible  It's tough  The Undertaker is  Undefeated right?  Yeah the story is that the Undertaker's 20-0 at Wrestlemania  Oh  And so CM Punk wants to be the guy to break the streak  Like the streak is one of the biggest matches at Wrestlemania 
[01:41:30]  Has he lost CM Punk?  CM Punk's lost many times  Yeah he's won many times  Nah they gotta let the Undertaker go out undefeated at Wrestlemania right?  No  But Vince is a dick  That's not good for business  It doesn't make sense  Why?  There's no reason to have a streak  If at the end of it it doesn't  If you're leaving  You're supposed to bring up the next guy  Not just take it with you  Oh isn't that problems that they've had in the past  About leaving on top  Or bringing up the next guy  Yeah Brett Hart  He's like fuck you Sean 
[01:42:00]  And they're like okay  Yeah  Alright sure yeah  And then he gives Vince a black eye  Yeah  Staggers out of the locker room  I love how Vince came out of that locker room  Fucking flustered  I got punched in the face  He took it though  He did  Brett Hart punched a dude in the face  In real life  Yeah  Because he wanted to keep a scripted championship  You know what I guess that is pretty fucking weird  Yeah  We never played the Conrad Murray thing by the way  Oh right  And this thing is all over the place as well 
[01:42:30]  Who's busy talking about Fandangan  Fandangan  An N at the end of that  Anderson Cooper  Broke character  And was rolling his eyes  And doing all sorts of weird shit  Because Conrad Murray decided  He wanted to explain his life in song I think  Yeah yeah  I think that's how this was going down  Yeah  And uh  Can we play the video?  Uh yeah  It's the same thing  I just have to cue up the clip  Alright  That's not funny  But he's trying to 
[01:43:00]  He's trying to get another case right?  Conrad Murray?  He's trying to get out of jail  And he's trying to get out of jail  Any way possible  Right  Yeah yeah  He's not happy in jail  From what I hear  What do you think happens?  You think he gets out eventually?  Um  How long did he get?  How long did he get?  Four years  That long  Oh four years  And then you're out  And he's probably out soon  Right?  And you pretty much killed the guy?  That's not bad  Yeah  You know  You're a murderer  Conrad Murray was fucking 
[01:43:30]  Michael Jackson's doctor  People are asking you  Pay attention  Pay attention  Sorry  Wait for me to cue it up  This is  Sorry I thought that was known  For most  No?  Yeah Conrad Murray  He's been in and out of the press  For a long time now  Oh  Yeah  Not a good doctor though  But fair enough  Yeah Michael Jackson's doctor  Who uh  Yeah he's been saying  He keeps saying he's sick  When he's in jail  Like you see  He's telling people he's sick  I'm sick  He's telling people he's in danger  He hates being in jail  Oh does he hate it 
[01:44:00]  Well who likes being in jail?  I'm saying this dude  Really hates it  He really hates it  Yeah  I liked it  You liked it  You were never in jail  Chip  I was a sick fuck  I ran the place  Is that true?  Fuck yeah  What's in charge  It's a stupid  Alright here we go  Alright  No  Maybe  Fast forward it  We're talking exclusively  Not it to me  Let me ask you  Let me just ask you  Finally  You say you were a friend  Of Michael Jackson  Interrupt your volume  You cared about his children  That's how originally  You took care of his children  At a hotel in Vegas 
[01:44:30]  That's how they initially met you  His children are now suing  This company  AG Lodge  Su everyone  There's some people who would say  Well if you were  Really cared about them  Why not testify about what you know  In this lawsuit  If I testify  I will testify very honestly  It is a sad thing  When I look at what's going on  On television  Because if Michael was alive  He would be absolutely upset  He would be so unhappy  With what is happening  If you hadn't killed him  I no longer want to be a bank 
[01:45:00]  For my family  But all you see  Is the continuation of that  He's had some real pains  And I have had some  Stories of Michael  That he has shared with me  That I have not shared with the world  That's how it is  We had very very humble lives  And we both experienced pain  You know what describes me  Anderson  Let me sing something for you  This is important to me  He's a little boy  That Santa Claus forgot  Look at Anderson's face  What the fuck 
[01:45:30]  Anderson's head's going back and forth  Like a dog hearing a whistle  Who hasn't got a daddy  He's a little boy  That Santa Claus forgot  That song tells my story  That's how I grew up  I had no Christmases 
[01:46:00]  I had no toys  I had nothing  I walked death with it for years  That was a great audio  That's the guy that put it  Michael Jackson put his life  In that man's hands  Right, right  So who's really to blame there  Well, you know  Michael Jackson was a weirdo  That hung out with other weirdos  This guy  What did Anderson Cooper say after that?  Nothing  He moved on to the next question  He didn't even address it  Wow  He just quickly moved on to the next one  I don't know why  He wouldn't be like  Yeah  What did you just do?  He just sang to me, dude 
[01:46:30]  Why?  Isn't that weird?  The boy that Santa Claus forgot?  That's great  What does that have to do with anything?  Nothing  He's crazy  He's a madman  He killed Michael Jackson  Right  Well, some would say  Isn't that what he's in jail for?  A court and jury would say  He's still  He's Michael Jackson's killer  He killed Michael Jackson  Yeah, I saw it on the news  You know, what the circumstances are  Is another story 
[01:47:00]  How does it get to a point  Where you have a doctor  That's putting you to sleep  With propofol  And then the doctor hangs  But sometimes he doesn't hang  He just knows he'll be alright  Yeah  Right  He wasn't there every night  When he was on the propofol  I wouldn't think so  I really  When I heard about that  Like Michael Jackson  Was trying all these medications  And pills  And fucking  To sleep  I really felt empathy for him  It's like  I know that feeling, man  And especially when you have access  To everything like he did  You could say  I want this  I want that  I need everything 
[01:47:30]  Just like  And it still  Didn't help him sleep  But going from like  Ambien to propofol  There's a big  Huge fucking  No, I know  But then eventually  It leads where you're  You think it's okay  To go to sleep  With propofol  That's how bad  And that just shuts  Your brain off, right?  It doesn't really give you  The REM sleep  Or does it?  Does it give you  A restless  A restful sleep?  It gives you the same sleep  If you've ever had  A fucking  General anesthesia  Right  You just get knocked 
[01:48:00]  The fuck out  Right  It's a time machine  Yeah, then all of a sudden  You're like waking up  You have no concept  That you were out  For eight hours  Really, right?  Yeah, when you sleep  You know, regular sleep  You wake up  And you kind of  You're aware of time  Going by  You know, like  All right  Yeah, I've slept for a while  That kind of sleep  Is that, you know  All right, boom  You're out  And then all of a sudden  You're up again  And fucking, you know  Twelve hours has gone by  Yeah, when I had my throat  Scoped for the stupid  Ass reflux shit  I had the propofol  I think it was only out 
[01:48:30]  For 15 minutes  I don't even know  You don't know  As I tell you this story  I don't even know  15 minutes, 15 hours  Whatever  That's my point  It could have been  15 minutes or an hour  I don't know  Yeah  It was probably  Maybe a half hour tops  But you have no concept  Of that time going by  Yeah  I remember the doctor  Going, have a good sleep  And next thing you know  I'm in the recovery room  Going, what the fuck just happened?  This is the weirdest thing ever  When does it start?  When are we getting started on this?  It kind of makes you think  That there's nothing after this life 
[01:49:00]  Oh, Jesus  Why wasn't there any awareness?  Why wasn't there any awareness?  Is this real life?  It's just a little drug  That completely shuts off your brain  That's it  That says a lot  About the afterlife  Don't you think?  Jesus  I don't know  Yikes  When your solely thing  Still be there somewhere  Going  Giving you some kind of awareness  You'd think  Oh man  That was creepy  I say we break  And I say we do some scorch 
[01:49:30]  Before Louis CK comes in here  Scorch  It is a slow news day  So we certainly could clear the field for this  Now I could actually go to the bathroom  Because I don't have to avoid  Right  A fondant  Yeah  And also you got a rolling bit  Should we play it into break?

[01:52:00]  First Bueller? First Bueller Day? 
[01:52:30]  Nah, it's too late for First Bueller Day.  Why?  It's only one break left or so.  Oh, man. Does this have something to do with First Bueller?  Well, the song was in it.  I know that, but I mean, why are you playing it?  Wayne Newton's birthday.  Oh, is it?  Oh, yeah. I forget that. This is Wayne Newton. 
[01:53:00]  Sounds like a woman.  I know.  Newton's 71.  No, this is a man.  Wayne Newton.  This is Wayne Newton's song.  He was a kid when he was doing it.  He started out as a kid.  You didn't know this, Jimmy?  I didn't know this was Wayne.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  What year is this?  I think he did it like five years ago.  This is old.  Really old.  This is black and white old.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  That's a video.  He was the Justin Bieber of his day.  But he's kind of older, isn't he?  Yeah, yeah.  A little.  But, I mean, you look at Wayne Newton like he's a man, but back then, you know what I mean by it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's kind of.  Oh, God.  I'm watching.  Oh, how humiliating.  What?  I'm watching the video.  I'll tell you where it is.  The cuck video?  Four seconds in, watch the video of me oiling Fandango's arm.  And I, oh, four seconds in, watch me miss.  What do you mean? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that's perfect.  You were eager.  Look at that.  You were eager.  He turned away and Jimmy went to.  Jimmy, you want to get his abs?  Oh, he threw a secret vest at me.  This is off my stupid fucking phone.  Oh, he misses the arm.  Dude, that's hilarious.  We'll have more video, but there's a quick one up there right now. 
[01:55:00]  Jimmy, you oiling up Fandango.  Nice little surprise for the show today.  That kind of threw us off our game.  I knew it was coming.  You knew it was coming.  Yeah.  Wow.  He didn't know.  I tweeted the video, OP Radio on Twitter, if you want to take a look, because we don't  have a visual element.  What's going on with Robert Redford's hair, by the way?  It's a wig.  Is it?  Oh, fuck yeah.  He has to keep his red hair.  He seems like he always had hair, though.  I think he...  You never, ever saw Robert Redford went, wow, he's losing his hair. 
[01:55:30]  He always had a good head of hair.  Somewhere along the line, he made the switcheroo.  The old switcheroo?  The old switcheroo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's definitely a fucking wig.  It has to be.  Like, look.  Yeah.  That's too much hair.  But that's where those guys fuck up.  They give themselves too much hair.  I don't think we have time to go into it.  He always had hair.  So weird.  You don't think...  All right.  Or maybe he's just dying, and that's what's making it all fucked up. 
[01:56:00]  Maybe it's soy sauce.  Yeah.  He's got to dye the sides, too.  Stop being so lazy.  Yeah.  The sides are gray, but...  Yeah.  They fucking dye up those sideburns.  Yeah.  Get it all...  That's a wig.  Look at that thing.  Come on, man.  I know.  So somewhere along the line, he...  Maybe...  Maybe he still has a lot of his hair, but not enough for...  You know what I mean?  I know.  He looks bald.  But...  There's no way that's his hair.  But he was never losing it.  He's been in the public eye forever.  Burt Reynolds has been wearing a wig for a long...  He's wearing a wig.  That's true. 
[01:56:30]  Probably had some hair pieces and some things he was doing, and just kept filling it in, filling  it in, and then finally said, fuck, I've got to go with the hair helmet.  The back always gives it away.  The way it curls up in the back, nothing...  The real hair comes out of the back.  Nothing better than seeing a horrible hair piece on the streets of New York.  Because you've got to...  Makes my day every time.  You've got to point it out to all your pals.  But someone...  That person has decided he looks better that way than just walking around bald.  Yeah.  I'm talking about the over-the-top horrendous fucking hair pieces, where everybody knows 
[01:57:00]  how much...  Well, Logan says he saw Robert Redford at work live, and his hair is a holy terror.  Wow, really?  Is it real?  Or a wig?  It's got to be a wig.  No, if he's saying holy terror, that means it's...  It's got to be a wig.  It's horrendously bad.  But it looks good on camera, I guess, when he's making his films.  Because they're showing a clip of Underground, I guess that's his new movie. 
[01:57:30]  And it doesn't look that bad.  Look, it doesn't look that bad on film.  Oh, God, look at the picture fucking Sam just found!  I know.  Of course that's a hair helmet.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Did you put in Robert Redford wig?  I just put in Robert Redford hair.  Put Robert Redford wig.  And see what people are saying for us.  All right, look there. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah, that's a hair system.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, they're getting better with the hair systems, but that's obvious.  Yeah, it's for sure a hair system.  Yeah, it doesn't look like he went with the plugs.  He's doing some kind of hair system.  Like where they put the mesh over your head and all sorts of shit.  The plastic wrap on your whole head, and then they put the wig in, and they cut it.  That's just a wig, though?  A hair piece?  You think it's more than that?  I think it's a system, like Obi said.  I think he's all in.  He's really spending a lot of money trying to keep... 
[01:58:30]  Put Robert Redford bald.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That's horrible.  Robert Redford bald.  Put that in.  Let's see what happens.  Robert Redford bald.  Do we get any bald?  Yeah, bald.  By the way, if you were listening to the Joe Rogan podcast right now, and he was talking about  this, you'd be seeing what we're talking about.  Oh, right.  A podcast is doing...  There's not one...  Not to downplay what Rogan does, but I'm just saying, if podcasts have figured out how  to get a visual element, why can't we?  Here's what I'm thinking, though. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, it obviously looks like a wig.  I get it.  But when you say, like, Burt Reynolds, there was a point in Burt Reynolds' career where  you were like, oh, boy, he's losing his hair.  And John Travolta, same thing.  Oh, boy, he's losing his hair.  Like, there was never a point where you looked at Robert Redford, it went like, ah, he's  thinning.  He always had a great head of hair.  Because his hair was so important to him, more than a Burt Reynolds.  Yeah, but Burt Reynolds had nothing he could do about it.  If you're going bald, there's nothing Burt...  But he was a guy that was like, ah, fuck, I'm going bald, I'm still getting movies. 
[01:59:30]  He didn't really care.  Robert Redford...  Burt Reynolds gave a fucking big shit about going bald.  Well, then he finally got a wig, right.  Don't forget, though, he's also been a sex symbol for so long, so like you said, it's  important...  But Reynolds was a sex symbol.  But he was directing for a while.  Reynolds has always been in front of the camera, so we noticed shit that you might...  Redford probably could stay away from public view for eight, nine months at a time, or  a year at a time, and you'd never notice because he was behind the camera directing.  You know what?  It would have turned up earlier on. 
[02:00:00]  You could have looked and said, eh, he's losing a little.  No, from that angle, it doesn't look as bad.  Doesn't look as wig-ish.  Not as wig-ish.  But the color...  Wow.  I don't know how the back looks.  Are you guys out of your fucking minds?  That's a hat.  I don't know.  Dude, I'm not...  From this angle, I'm not really sure, Jimmy.  I'm thinking, uh, uh, baby...  It's a hat.  It's the fucking Planet of the Apes helmet that the one guy wore.  The Gorilla General? 
[02:00:30]  Are you saying we're losing our minds?  Yeah.  Because now we're like, I don't know.  You're out of your fucking minds.  You're out of your fucking minds.  Hey, you like that fucking hat Jeter has?  You like fucking Jeter's hairdo with the NY on it?  Fucking idiots.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  He has too much hair.  He's got to be in his 70s by now.  But I can't find anything.  That would have led me to believe he was even losing his hair at some point.  So what you're basically saying is, because there are no good pictures online, you'll  deny what your eyes are telling you right now. 
[02:01:00]  Look at Dustin Hoffman's hair.  This is from all the president's men.  And look, what a great head of hair.  Yeah, Hoffman too.  He wasn't losing his hair.  Yeah.  Let's see it bounce now.  If he takes one jogging step, it's going to fucking bounce and fall upside down like  a walk.  I bet there's a fucking nail coming out of the middle of his head that that screws onto.  And more to Jimmy's point, it says Redford returns to acting. 
[02:01:30]  So he did take a bunch of years off.  He's directing all these years.  Yeah, the horse whisperer.  That's never been my point.  Ordinary people.  For 30 years, he's been directing.  He's saying he never was even losing his hair.  If he might have been, A, he might have been on it really quickly, or he might have had  a wig longer than you think.  I don't know.  That to me, look, I wouldn't swear to it.  Or maybe he hasn't even really lost a lot of hair, but enough where he feels like, I  got to put a wig on.  Put a wig on?  Maybe, yeah.  That thing has a fucking propeller on it.  That's what the matter with you two? 
[02:02:00]  You think that's a hair piece?  No.  I bet my life it is.  Yeah, there's no real part in his hair.  There's a lot of hair up there.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  It's great.  It is a system.  It's called Lego people.  I love how Jimmy got mad at us.  I can't believe it.  I don't know.  Fucking you gullible zilches.  It's obvious.  Especially the sideburns aren't really matching.  That's where they always lose you, is the sideburns.  They fuck it up a little bit.  Well, all right. 
[02:02:30]  We're running out of scorch time.  You know that.  Well, come on.  What are we going to get, Louie?  Are we going to get him on right at nine?  Should be at nine.  Come on.  Let's get a little scorch time.  It's dependent on his previous...  We don't have to do an hour of scorch.  All right.  So, scorch, for the newer listeners, is a guy we worked with a long time ago at AF.  The only station that really rocks in the Boston area.  He was the night guy.  He was always a little quirky.  We really did like him a lot.  He pretty much got pushed out for Rocco because scorch was, I think, hamburger. 
[02:03:00]  And, I don't know, Dave Douglas, the PD, wanted pizza.  They wanted pizza.  And that's how he explained to the scorch that he was out.  He was basically saying, you're not bad, but I want a different meal right now, which was Rocco.  So, scorch has bounced around ever since.  Our own young, well, not so young anymore, Sam Roberts.  That's how I was young, boy.  Interned for scorch, so we have something in common with him.  And we've been able to kind of catch up with what scorch has been up to for Sam. 
[02:03:30]  And he's got his PFG TV.  And now he has a PFG TV that he, I think, someone tweeted me, I don't know if it's true,  but he was basically bragging, I think, on this very episode we're about to watch only a part of,  that he has more viewers than Games of Thrones, or Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  You should remind the audience.  He said he has more viewers than Game of Thrones.  No, he didn't.  According to a tweet I got last night, I am saying that, yes, our listeners do get things wrong.  So, I'm not sure that he actually said this. 
[02:04:00]  Some of the audience has lost as to what PFG stands for.  Oh, right.  What is it again?  At a time, it stood for pretty effing good.  Right, okay.  It has since been changed to pretty effing great.  Oh, oh, oh, I got you.  And I hear he's bragging about all the affiliates again, and the outreach of the show,  and that it's going to go international, I was reading.  Well, he said he was syndicated to London.  Yes.  Yeah, he did.  Yes, he did.  He rules.  So, without further ado, this is episode three. 
[02:04:30]  Season six, episode three.  Oh, season six, episode three.  Yeah, yeah, it was his sixth big season.  And, you know, we've watched him progress.  He started in, like, a bar.  Right.  And then he went to a local access studio.  Don't forget the hotel lounge.  Right.  And then after that, he went to the hotel lounge.  Hotel lounge.  Basically where you check in, by the way.  Not their kind of sort of restaurant-y area.  No.  And then we got the wide shot.  Right.  And we saw that there was no audience.  No audience. 
[02:05:00]  No audience.  But you hear an audience.  It doesn't matter.  He puts the audience in in post.  In his mind, he's in front of thousands of people at any given moment.  He's taking over the Tonight Show.  The audience is out there, not in here.  This is one of the greatest things you could watch on a regular basis.  Yeah.  All right, here you go.  Who's a fan of this?  Colin Quinn?  Colin Quinn loves Scorch.  Colin's a big fan of Scorch.  We're obviously fans.  He loves the Scorch story.  I think he really, I mean, and he really loves that I went and, like, was his young intern  learning from him and then betrayed him.  He does love that story.  He does love the storyline part. 
[02:05:30]  He does love the betrayal part.  I don't think I betrayed him.  All right, so now he's doing it from a loft, I guess?  It appears to be a warehouse.  I don't know exactly.  Even his video descriptions.  He lives in a different world than we do.  Yes.  Can you read the video description?  Yeah, in this week's episode, we have an interview with international dancer, Lacey  Rain.  So he has some dumb stripper.  Who?  As well as with actor-comedian, Matty Blake.  Who?  I have a question, though.  Because Game of Thrones is very popular.  Obviously, he's more popular. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Why does episode three thus far only have 164 views?  And that's with me tweeting it last night.  And that probably doesn't help either.  There are six likes on the video, but five dislikes.  Oh.  I think everyone should be liking Scorch's shit.  We also have an interview with a few of the members of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, as  well as a live performance of their show.  Really?  A few of the members.  A few of the members. 
[02:06:30]  You know they probably have 200 members.  It's a really big production.  It's an orchestra.  It is.  So who's the interviewer?  I don't know.  We'll find out today on PFG TV.  I love the intro.  Without further ado, yes.  The intro shows.  The intro's amazing.  I think it's, where is that?  That would.  California?  Where is the intro show?  Yeah, the video of the intro.  Oh, that looks like Santa Monica Pier.  Santa Monica Pier.  But he's doing it from New Hampshire.  Manch Vegas, to be exact.  Manch Vegas. 
[02:07:00]  He's doing it from Manch.  So why is the intro from the Santa Monica Pier?  I don't know, but he makes it very big and very, like it's a Hollywood talk show.  It's the show part of the show business.  Right, right, right.  That's true.  Let's hear it.  Oh, do I love this?  Oh, wow.  Let's hear the crowd.  Live from PFG Television Center.  It's not live.  PFG Television Center.  What is that?  What?  Both of those statements.  It's not live.  No, it's not live.  It's obviously taped weeks in advance.  Recorded.  I feel like we could get a list going. 
[02:07:30]  All the lies.  All the lies.  All of the lies from PFG TV.  First of all, your intro's a lie.  Yeah.  You're not broadcasting from the Santa Monica Pier.  Uh-huh.  You're not live.  What was the other one?  The broadcast center is one of your friend's loft.  Yeah.  Loft.  PFG TV broadcast center.  Like there's other stuff going on there at the same time.  They're fucking, they're filming sitcoms and documentaries and yeah, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Cooking shows.  It's like, um, what's the fucking, uh, studio we have over there in Queens?  Oh, like a silver, uh, silver cup studios.  Yes.  That's what we're looking at here.  Yeah.  All right.  The beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Live.  Live.  Live from PFG television center at Red 13 studio.  Welcome to scorches PFG TV.  I am Lord Doug man.  W.  Cotspeed tonight on another exciting episode, international dancing sensation, Lacey Ray. 
[02:08:30]  Internet.  Also an exclusive interview and performance by Yuletide metal.  I have a lie.  I have a lie.  You have a lie.  Two lies.  Yeah.  One, the episode will be exciting.  That's a lie.  And also those cheers in the back are implied to be under this exciting announcement.  And that's a lie.  That's a lie.  But his production value getting a little better, I noticed.  Oh, man.  The production is stepping up. 
[02:09:00]  Stepping up.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And I don't think Lord Doug is actually a Lord.  I don't know if that's a Lord.  Yeah.  I would put that on the lies.  Maybe they have to.  Okay.  The Lord people would get very mad at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's no Lord.  No.  Oh, my God.  This is so fucking bad already.  Another exciting episode.  And so the strip abroad, she's international because she might have went over the border and  danced in Canada.  Is that what's going on here?  No, she's just probably from fucking.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say that she probably just made that up. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  Let's go.  I'm psyched.  And another exciting episode, international dancing sensation, Lacey Rae.  Yeah.  Also an exclusive interview and performance by Yuletide Metal Super Show, Trans-Siberian  Orchestra.  You may recognize him from his many TV shows and commercials.  Action comedian, Matty Blake.  Many TV shows?  Take your daughters and hide your wives. 
[02:10:00]  That's it.  It's Scorch's co-host, Seb Hashian.  So let's make some noise for your host.  Oh, no.  Listen to the fake.  Yeah.  Hyped in applause.  What a show tonight, because as Shelly said, tonight we've got internationally known dancer  Lacey Rain, which is amazing.  Oh, my God.  I'm so excited.  That's got to be a dubbed in.  What you don't understand yet is, you, Sibby, I've arranged for you to be her pole so she 
[02:10:30]  can dance.  Oh, Chip, you like that?  Fuck yeah.  But the bad part is, that's the good part.  But the bad part is, she's got to...  Is that electronic home on our end?  Is that the radio?  No.  There's such a bad echo.  The sound is terrible on PFG TV.  I would think the PFG Broadcast Center would have better equipment.  They might have to hire Mars.  Nothing's grounded over there.  Nothing's grounded. 
[02:11:00]  Especially not Scorch.  Someone could get electrocuted at any moment, I'm sure.  So she could dance.  Yeah.  She's going to...  But the bad part is, that's the good part.  But the bad part is, she's going to give me lessons.  So I'm going to be all over you, too, just so you know.  I'll pass.  Plus, I was on the show tonight, and this is the coolest thing.  I've been friends with the band, and I hate to do name dropping.  I've been friends with the band for a long time.  He hates to do name dropping?  It's an exclusive for the show. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, exclusive.  Trans-Siberian Orchestra is going to be here tonight.  So anyway, we have a lot of stuff going on.  Let's get into it with the first segment that we call Weird News.  Weird News.  We're lucky today.  I miss the music.  Weird News.  How about this story?  Okay, should we get into a fight?  You're married.  Of course, chicks don't like me, so it ain't never going to happen for me.  That's not what I heard.  Did you ever get...  Well, because I'm loaded, they like me.  Did you ever...  What?  Hold on, pause.  All right, another lie.  Another lie.  Unless he means drunk. 
[02:12:00]  Scorch is not loaded.  He's trying to say he's loaded?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam has told us the stories.  He's been hiding from landlords for years.  No, he's not loaded.  Why?  No.  No.  Is he loaded?  No, he's a little bit loaded.  He's a workhorse.  Loaded.  You're not with money.  Did you ever have a fight, like a really good fight with your wife?  Honestly, no.  No, see, that's a good thing.  Avoid confrontation.  I respect that. 
[02:12:30]  Susan Sanford of Chicago, Illinois, got into trouble recently, threw carbolic acid on her  boyfriend.  Oh, where?  On his face.  Ready for this?  She threw carbolic acid because she didn't like the way he chewed with his mouth open.  Strict.  So, so she tells the stories.  Can you pause just for a second?  Wow.  What happened?  That's the worst talk show table I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, what is it?  It's got the up ridges. 
[02:13:00]  Like, it's like a fucking, a small, like, gaming table.  It's terrible.  Yeah, it looks like a foosball table.  It's from Pottery Barn.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a little TV table.  It looks like the start of a canoe.  Anyone knows about a barn?  You're welcome.  Yeah, what's he, a pothead toe?  Go ahead.  Play the tape.  Cocksucker.  I just didn't like the noise he was making while he was chewing. 
[02:13:30]  And I'm thinking, yeah, the noise of a guy whose face is burning from carbolic acid.  And that's a little bit better than a guy chewing on food, right?  So, wow.  The dude has received multiple skin grafts.  Oh, God.  And she's received seven years in the pen.  So, yeah.  That's an excellent subject to open the talk show with.  Yes, yes.  No jokes.  There wasn't a joke there.  Right.  And then he, like, goes, so there it is.  And he throws it out to the audience, like, applaud. 
[02:14:00]  Right, right.  That's a weird news formula.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like you read a weird news story, and then you move on to the next story.  We add nothing to it.  Weird news.  Yes.  You read the story.  You've got to make sure you don't add anything to it.  Right.  He should be doing a monologue, and this should be the second feature.  You're not open with weird news.  Uh-huh.  Or did he do a monologue?  Maybe I missed that.  No, but we've been watching since the beginning.  Probably.  Yeah, there was no.  They started on the couch.  Yep.  Just incredible.  And one more story for this round. 
[02:14:30]  Alfredo Morella.  Okay, Alfredo Morella.  What, from Montana?  The Montana story?  That's beautiful, man.  What?  Watch some of the past episodes at ScorchIsPFGTV.com.  Oh, my God.  He, like, prompted the audience.  Okay, I'm going to continue weird news in one second.  Watch the way we do this again.  Uh, you can watch all the past episodes at ScorchIsPFGTV.com. 
[02:15:00]  You know, you sit down, grab a drink, something to smoke, and you can really enjoy those shows.  I think he's talking about marijuana.  Marijuana.  That's edgy talk.  Yeah.  Oh, that was him kind of being, like, a little into the audience.  That's your rug reference.  A little blue.  Yeah, working a little blue.  I don't think Dennis Falcone would appreciate that.  No.  What are you going to do?  Brand new Red 13 Media Studios, by the way.  Brand new.  It's always a brand new studio.  Alfredo Morella was busted for reckless driving, okay? 
[02:15:30]  And he told the police he was being chased by cats.  By who?  Cats.  Like that shit?  Not even cats.  Not some Jewish guy down the street at the deli.  Cats.  He was being chased by cats.  Twissy cats.  So they gave him the sobriety test.  He passed the sobriety test, so he wasn't drunk.  They ended up having to put him in for observation, for psychological observation.  And that's how the name originally came up, of Chicken Alfredo.  Ooh. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you very much.  Anyway, that's our installment of Weird News for the talk.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  That was fucking hilarious.  I didn't get the joke.  Should I redo the punchline?  Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.  I don't know humor, man.  What's wrong with you?  What do you mean you didn't get the joke?  That's not dirty.  You didn't get the joke.  It's very funny.  You like it?  It's a marvelous sense of humor he has.  My mother loves Scorch.  It's a great line.  What?  Want to hear it again?  It's terrific.  Yeah, but maybe I wasn't paying attention.  Yeah, you got to listen with both of you, dude.  Let me listen.  The setup was there.  The setup.  Damn, hit you with the punchline. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  All right.  Here's this weird news.  And that's how the name originally came up, of Chicken Alfredo.  Wait, no.  I didn't hear the setup.  Yeah, no.  You're right.  You're right.  Come on, now.  You're right.  He was being chased by cats.  Who?  By who?  Cats.  Not Stephen Cats.  Wait, what's his name?  Not some Jewish guy down the street at the deli.  Cats.  He was being chased by cats.  I don't think you...  You need more?  You didn't go back far enough.  I need more.  I need more.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  You know, you sit down, grab a drink, something to smoke, and you can really enjoy those shows. 
[02:17:00]  Brand new Red 13 Media Studios.  Oh, yeah.  The show's on at night.  Yeah.  He says it's live.  Uh-huh.  There's light leaking from the window.  Yeah.  You can see the sun.  Oh, yeah.  You can't really block out the sun.  Oh, yeah.  It's live.  Right.  Alfredo Morello was busted for reckless driving.  Oh, his name is Alfredo.  Okay.  And he told the police he was being chased by cats. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  By who?  Cats.  Not Stephen Katz.  Not some Jewish guy down the street at the deli.  Cats.  He was being chased by cats.  Twissy Katz.  So they gave him the sobriety test.  He passed the sobriety test, so he wasn't drunk.  They ended up having to put him in for observation, for psychological observation.  And that's how the name originally came up, of Chicken Alfredo.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Thank you very much.  So the guy's name's Alfredo. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, we get that part.  But why Chicken?  Because he was scared of cats?  Oh, he's Chicken.  Exactly right.  I think.  That's exactly right.  Because he was being chased by cats?  Yep.  He was running away very scared, like, uh...  Chicken?  That's exactly right.  And is it Chicken Alfredo?  Then you had the last name.  It was Linguini Alfredo.  No, his name's Alfredo.  Oh, you know what?  And he was running.  Yeah, I don't think I've ever heard Chicken Alfredo.  I don't even think it's Chicken Alfredo.  I think you're right.  I think it's like...  He's stretching it.  Linguini Alfredo or something Alfredo.  I think you're right.  Shrimp? 
[02:18:30]  Shrimp?  Fettuccine.  Fettuccine Alfredo.  That's what it is.  Okay, okay.  It's Fettuccine Alfredo, not Chicken Alfredo.  Okay, you're right.  Oh, boy.  Wow, did he fuck that up?  He was excited, though, that the guy's last name was Alfredo.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  Anyway, that's our installment of weird news for today.  He does two questions.  And then he does, yeah.  You know me, I'm always like a good pussy.  I know you do.  You know what?  You know, I used to do a game, but I worked at another radio station, by the way.  Because we can't show the audience. 
[02:19:00]  Wow.  He just shook hands.  You don't shake hands with your co-host on the air, you dumb fuck.  Scorch does.  What, three minutes and 52 seconds in is not the time to shake hands?  Why?  We finished a segment.  They're very excited.  That guy used to be in Boston, right?  Yeah.  And you also, you got to notice that, like, whenever that dude makes a joke, Scorch is  moving past onto his own shit.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Because the dude goes, I always love a pussy cat story.  And Scorch goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't make it blue.  Don't upstage me.  It's Scorch is PFG TV. 
[02:19:30]  I'm the star here.  He was being chased by cats.  Oh, not a cat.  By who?  Cats.  Not Stephen Cats.  Not some Jewish.  No, I can't.  Proper context.  He was being chased by cats.  What's the cats?  So they gave him the sobriety test.  He passed.  He passed?  The sobriety test.  So he wasn't drunk.  So what'd they do?  They ended up having to put him in for observation.  Wow.  Psychological observation.  Wow.  And that's how the name originally came up of Chicken Alfredo.  Ooh. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you very much.  Anyway, that's our installment of Weird News for today.  Yeah.  You know me.  I always like a good pussy cat story.  I know you do.  You know what?  You know, I used to do a game when I worked at another radio station.  By the way, I don't want to mention that one.  What time are you on?  I work at Rock 101, rock101fm.com.  It's probably right here in the bottom of your screen, 2 to 7 in the afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  2 to 7.  Right.  On iHeartRadio as well.  Anyway, so yeah, we are coming up.  You didn't turn it off.  He said it's probably right here at the bottom of your screen. 
[02:20:30]  They couldn't even do that right.  It wasn't.  That's the easiest thing to do.  In post-production.  Can you put that, what I'm saying, on the screen when I say it?  When I say it.  But the best part, he did, but way before he said it's probably right here.  So immediately.  By that time, they already got rid of the ground.  Holy shit.  It's fantastic.  Go ahead.  Who doesn't?  On the way, we're going to talk to Lace Urine and talk to Chance WRC. 
[02:21:00]  But right now, it's our very first sponsor for a live of Scorch's BFG TV.  We're coming right back.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at the band.  He's got a house band.  His house band is shoved in a corner.  You can see pipes and plumbing and shit.  Not in a good way.  No.  How long did they play for right there?  About 30 seconds, I would assume.  20 seconds.  Did we hear?  There was only two seconds he played. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, two seconds.  Oh, that was it?  We're already dark.  Yeah, it was more like four seconds.  Oh, I thought you paused it.  Can we see that again, please?  This is the big throw to the commercial with the band.  Right, to the band.  Just watch the Tonight Show.  The band plays for a little while.  There's a graphic.  It's nice.  Yeah, here we go.  Well, anyway.  I didn't notice this.  So, yeah.  Coming up.  You're a jerk-off.  You're a jerk-off on a talk show.  On the way.  We're going to talk to Lace Urine and talk to Chance WRC.  Here's the band.  But right now, it's our very first sponsor bring live at Scorch's BMT TV. 
[02:22:00]  We're coming right back.  Here's the band.  What's he doing?  One, two, three.  Three seconds.  Good catch.  Let that shit establish.  Oh, God.  This is so embarrassing.  Is this only funny for us?  I don't care.  I have to question this.  No, people love it.  They do?  Yes.  It's so ridiculous. 
[02:22:30]  His sponsor break.  A little more?  Yeah.  Please.  A little bit.  A little more.  Nah.  What?  What happened?  Oh, that's where the commercials are.  Yeah, but that's back from commercial?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, for the YouTube video, we cut all that shit out.  That's nothing.  2-7 in the afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  2-7.  He doesn't come back and say welcome back.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  So, yeah.  Coming up.  You didn't jerk.  Wait, wait.  This is what we saw already.  Right, and watch it go to break and just come back close.  Oh, okay. 
[02:23:00]  But right now, it's our very first sponsor break live on Scorch's BFG TV.  No music when they come back.  And the band in a corner on a fucking rug.  Now, for the very first time live on Scorch's BFG TV, we're going to be graced on the stage.  And I told Sibby that she was going to use him as her pole to teach me how to dance.  We heard that.  I heard that, Scorch.  Well, I'm going to be the one grinding on you, not her.  I remember. 
[02:23:30]  He just did the same two jokes five minutes later.  Oh, my God.  And Sib is still throwing his hands like, oh, fuck, Scorch.  Watch Sib give off a shot.  He takes both hands and throws him down like, oh, gosh.  Oh, boy.  He looks like Tony Iombe if he wasn't in Black Sabbath.  I'm going to be the one grinding on you, not her.  She's going to teach me how to dance on you, the pole.  She's an internationally known dancer, and she's been a friend for a long time. 
[02:24:00]  And she supports my paws for the cause for animals.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Charitable.  Applause for the cause, y'all.  Give it up for Lacey Ray, my friend.  They stand up for her.  But they can't get around the table.  The huge table.  The table's too big and intrusive.  All right.  She's pretty sexy.  She's tall.  International dancer, Lacey Ray.  You're having a heart attack already.  He hasn't been hugged by a girl in 10 years.  I love her, Lacey. 
[02:24:30]  She's hot.  Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Hug him again for a second, would you please?  Oh, for the pole?  No, just hug him again.  He's a couple.  Merry Christmas.  Anyway, have a seat, Lacey.  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you.  I called Lacey the other day at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, right?  This is going to be good.  And I hear, huh?  I'm like, wow, what a wife you have.  I'm on a beach in South Carolina.  I'm just waking up, man.  Sorry.  Why is that?  Because she's a stripper.  She wakes up late in the day.  What a life you have. 
[02:25:00]  I'll tell you why, though.  You should always open with a really interesting story.  Yeah, yeah.  And I called you, and you sounded tired.  You were tired.  Great way into the air.  So let me tell you, what a life you must be living.  It also establishes that a lot of times you see these celebrities on these shows, and you're  like, well, they're just there for the massive promotion.  No, Scorch has a personal relationship with this international.  He's trying to show that he talks to her on the phone during the off hours from PFG TV. 
[02:25:30]  Specifically 4 p.m. yesterday.  Right.  By the way, I think she's really hot, so here's what we should do.  We should get her in the studio, and then talk to her about all the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Oh, would that be great?  I would love to get the fucking skinny.  Yeah.  Is there an audience?  Where are they?  How are they not showing the audience at all?  Yeah, no audience shots.  Well, it's just his friends, right?  I heard him clapping.  Yeah, they're probably there, but...  If you can, let us know when Louis C.K. is like five minutes out, so we do a quick break  for live reads and pisses and shit.  Okay.  If you can.  If not, no worries. 
[02:26:00]  All right, go ahead.  Yeah, let's hear her.  All right, to Lacey Rain.  I'll be at the show, though, I promise you, you know.  I don't even remember that conversation.  What a surprise, you know what I mean?  You won't remember the appearance of the show either.  Of course she doesn't.  Tell us about you as a dancer, and I've said it many times.  Sibby, what's the matter?  Are you afraid of girls?  Oh, smokes.  I've never seen Sibby so far away from my chest.  He gives Sibby the business.  My whole entire life.  Do you like that, champ?  Yeah.  No.  You just don't trust yourself.  That's what it is. 
[02:26:30]  Put away if you would.  Oh, wow.  Here's the follow-up to that joke.  Because you're thinking of raping her, right, Sibby?  You don't trust yourself.  You might pull out your cock in the raper.  Scorch.  It's a fucking autopsy table in front of them.  It's terrible.  You should have one of those neck holders.  Drain.  Could you go full screen so we can maybe see her a little better? 
[02:27:00]  You know what?  She's sexy, man.  Yeah.  You live a relatively normal life.  Can't tell.  There are no close-ups on her.  I mean, I guess my home life is very traditional.  I have very traditional values.  Do you?  I don't do drugs.  Wait a sec.  Before you go any further.  Yes.  Do you have, like, naked pictures of yourself all up over your house?  No.  No.  Okay.  Because I was going to say, that's not normal.  Just say no. 
[02:27:30]  No.  He really had a home run there.  He really did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to come to your house and go take a pee.  That's all.  That's all that means.  No.  Anyway, go ahead.  So, yeah.  You don't do drugs.  He's a regular Johnny Carcinogen.  Yuck.  Jimmy Fallon.  Jimmy Fallon. 
[02:28:00]  He can't even have an interesting conversation with a stripper about things.  She's saying that she's, he just interrupts with nonsense.  Yeah.  Sit on naked pictures of yourself.  No, she's saying she has, like, a traditional, you know.  Yeah, she's saying I'm out of, I don't do drugs.  Delve into that.  Let's, uh.  Well, he's hoping to get a little heat for himself.  Yeah, he is.  That's a little opportunity for Scorchy to shine.  That's what he's looking for.  Right you are.  All right.  Let's get a little more.  You know what I mean?  Hey.  What are we doing?  You know what I mean? 
[02:28:30]  Let's get a little bit of everybody in.  You know.  No, you know what?  And it is really disappointing because, you know, you'll have a club full, let's just say,  of 20 girls.  And, you know, 18 of them will have their head on right.  And it's the two crackpots that the people want to talk about.  Why do they clap?  One, two.  Who's clapping?  You got numbers, right?  I tell people that I meet more messed up people at Dunkin' Donuts every morning getting  my coffee than I do with people that I work with.  Pause.  No, you mean Krispy Kreme.  We're trying to get Dunkin' Donuts as a sponsor.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Krispy Kreme. 
[02:29:00]  He's trying to get Dunkin' Donuts.  What was that?  And he means it.  He was scared there for a second.  Yeah.  Can you say, we're trying to get them as a sponsor?  Yeah, but why would that be bad?  She's plugging them.  Right.  He's the only one that doesn't want a company plugged when he wants to get them as a sponsor.  He doesn't understand.  Yeah, yeah.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  There's no moves to get Dunkin' Donuts as a sponsor.  No, of course not.  You don't think?  Is there a potential sponsor?  In his mind, there is, though.  That's why this is so great.  No, here's what happened.  He believes everything he's saying. 
[02:29:30]  He heard a company name.  And he said, if I say we're trying to get them as a sponsor, we will look like movers and shakers.  Right.  That will look like we're a big show.  And then Dunkin' Donuts, because this TV show is huge, we'll go, oh, did you hear?  Right.  He mentioned Dunkin' Donuts.  My God, we've got to get our corporate people on this immediately.  And then once he says it, then he believes it after that.  Right, right.  Oh, God.  It's the greatest.  The beauty of this is, first of all, that that horrendous table blocks the guests. 
[02:30:00]  Second of all, they're seated way too low.  It looks like a sillier table.  There's a reason Leno, Fallon, Kimmel.  The mini billboard.  Yeah.  None of those guys have shiny seats.  These are shiny leather.  Well, that's all we could get.  Pure one import seats.  No, you just get one that's like a fabric.  Right, right.  You don't want to go, look at this.  It looks like they're sitting in seas of light, still bouncing off.  And look how ugly the color is of the chair Skorch is sitting in, because he got that cheap,  because they would want to buy that one. 
[02:30:30]  It's terrible.  I have that in brown, matter of fact.  That's a pottery bar and fucking leather chair.  Dude, that's awful.  It's an awful chair.  I would love to hear the pre-show of him.  All right, here we go.  Here we go, people.  In three, two.  Why is this table so big?  The table is the worst table I've ever seen.  There's no reason for that table.  None.  It's huge, and it's not convenient to got to squeeze through to sit properly.  It's too close to the couch there.  It's so intrusive into the scene. 
[02:31:00]  And I love his pizazzless co-host.  I love this guy.  He's got his crazy Eddie fucking turtleneck and blazer.  Why do they need such a big table?  There's no need for that table.  It's angering me.  Now that we're pointing it out, it's the only thing I see.  It's angering.  It's giant.  What are they going to use it for?  There's never anything on it.  Right.  No, no.  There's no reason for it.  They don't have any items to place on the table.  It's probably because he's hoping Pottery Barn comes to the table. 
[02:31:30]  He's like, all right, we got the big Pottery Barn table.  Yeah, don't mention the table.  Pratic basement.  I'll bet he got it for free.  He probably got a discount or got it for free, because he's like,  are you going to be on TV every week?  I have more people than Game of Thrones.  I only found it on this side of the road.  Yeah, it might be more.  He's one of those guys.  He gets people to believe.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody donated that for his time.  Absolutely.  They believe in all his lies.  Simby believes.  Yes.  How can I not be doing it?  I want to do a talk show.  You've got to do this show.  I would love to.  I'd be on his show, sure.  That's what I'm saying.  If he'd have me.  Imagine if I couldn't get booked on.  But I want to do my own talk show. 
[02:32:00]  That's a goal of mine.  And it's like, I've got to do it now.  Scorch has one.  Why would I just do it?  It's so easy.  Just do it.  Get a little set somewhere.  You have to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Weird news.  Weird news.  I can steal everything he does.  Oh, that would be great.  Come on.  Steal his voice, too.  All right, Jim Norton.  Hey, yes.  How do you do?  Tom Horton.  Tim Horton's up in Canada.  That's what I mean.  We don't mean any local donut shops.  It could be potential money.  But, Lisa, you're loaded.  This show's broke. 
[02:32:30]  Don't be talking about that crap.  You're kidding.  So, what is it?  I mean, honestly.  Well said.  Wow.  He fumbled question number two of his lead guests.  He has nothing.  What is it that you're doing here?  Here's why you have a desk in front of you, dumbbell.  So you can put cards on it.  Right.  Do you think all those guys, do you think Letterman just improvs every question?  He's got blue cards in front of him that he can refer to when he needs to.  Well, let me put them on the table here. 
[02:33:00]  Exactly.  You got a table, Bill.  You got to play fucking bocce ball on.  How about you put a card with some questions on it?  It's a giant bocce ball table.  All right.  Let's hear them.  I have creepy guys like me and Sibby.  You know what I mean?  Because it's got to happen.  You know what I mean?  Flattering.  Sometimes terrifying.  It's terrifying.  Jimmy Dunn is in the green room right now, and he's ready to jump out the windows.  He's like, I'm coming over there now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  So he's okay with you.  Did he get the tissues he was looking for?  So, holy shit.  I'm fucking mesmerized and horrified.  You're jealous, man.  Yeah.  You're jealous.  Yeah.  I love his co-host.  Sib.  Sib.  Sib.  Sib.  Sib.  We hung out with Sibby a few times.  Sib's gone.  He's actually a good guy.  I don't want to beat him up too much.  Oh, Sib is the best.  He actually is a really good guy.  He's out of his element here.  He belongs behind a drum kit fucking playing to fucking old Boston songs. 
[02:34:00]  Hammered away to more than a feeling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen to more than a feeling.  That's Sib.  Right.  Playing drums on it.  He used to be out of a god.  He was in Boston?  Yeah, he was the drummer of Boston.  He's the drummer of the band Boston.  I know.  And not like the drummer after the one left.  He's the fucking drummer on all those amazing Boston songs from the 70s.  Those epic songs.  Is he set for life or no?  Is this just something he's doing for fun? 
[02:34:30]  He's bored.  Maybe.  He used to hang out at our AAF gigs.  We've had many a beer with the guy during our time.  Yeah, yeah.  He went to all the big gigs up there.  Oh, God.  Too much.  Where's Louis C.K.?  He's still on Howard.  Okay.  Should we break real quick and then pee and then come back?  I mean, if we have time, I've got to whiz badly.  I'll just run out.  All right.  He's finishing up over there, I think.  So maybe...  Yeah, all right.  Break.  We're going to have Louis C.K. next.  Maybe more Scorch.  Scorch. 
[02:35:00]  You could get out of it.  Go back in.  That's the beauty of Scorch.  No, what we should do is just...  We just should find another segment of Scorch.  Someone should go through this and just find a nice little something-something, all right?  Don't eat my pennant butter.  Louis C.K. next.  Peanut.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden, and we met this  guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  Fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache, you know, and we became friends with him somehow. 
[02:35:30]  He's like, oh, give me your address.  He started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this...  It was this deep at 14, and he's on the other end, and I'm asking all these questions,  and he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea, but then he wound up staying over at my house.  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we'd all go to the matches.  He convinced my dad. 
[02:36:00]  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York to the middle of Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know, but they're like, all right, you know.  They talk to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40-year-old guy hanging around 14-year-olds.  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand down my pants.  He snuck down there, and I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He grabbed my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers, and he blocked 
[02:36:30]  the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I got 50 pictures in there.  I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you got to tell mom and dad about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me get the pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that in this camera.  This has been a molestation moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  This is the OPNT Channel with Sirius XM. 
[02:37:00]  Why I'm on the radio.  Going to have Louis C.K. stopping in soon here.  I don't like lying.  It's Louis.  Louis. 
[02:37:30]  Louis.  It's Louis C.K.  It's Loic.  Loic.  Loic.  Oh, boy.  More time for Scorch?  Yes, we do.  I hope so.  Where are we?  We're watching the international.  International star, Lacey Rain, who I've never heard of.  International dancer.  I have a crush on her, though.  She's so tiny.  She's sexy as all hell.  Give it a sniff.  I don't know what he's trying to do with this. 
[02:38:00]  I want to give it a sniff.  He's awkwardly asking questions.  Yeah, the guy in the dressing room trying to bury his face.  Yeah, yeah.  I love when he starts mumbling to himself.  Look at the giant table.  I can't get back.  The table, the light.  That giant table, the giant charismaless white wall behind him.  It really is enraging.  It's a mental hospital.  You can't walk around it.  You've got to squeeze through. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Isn't a table normally either the height of the couch or lower?  Right.  Much lower.  It's higher than the couch.  Dude, it's higher than the fucking standing people.  Standing people.  That's an extremely ugly design.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear a little more of Scorch and the lacy rain.  Okay.  It is.  I mean, you know, at the same time, though, when it goes away, that means I'm done.  Well, sure.  No, you've got to agree with that.  You know what I mean?  You're in the business. 
[02:39:00]  We're all in the business.  If you kind of want to shut it off, everyone.  We're all in the business.  What business are you in?  The business of show.  We're all in the business of show business.  He's equating himself to a stripper and talking about how they're both in show business.  I love the sconce lights behind him.  Oh, yeah.  There's a fucking sconce light.  It looks like an arrow pointing if someone said, who's an ass?  It's right over him.  But the best is the shade because they're trying to make believe they're doing this at night.  You see the sun coming through. 
[02:39:30]  Sunlight's coming through the bottom of the afternoon.  All right.  Why wouldn't you darken that somehow?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just do it at night?  They couldn't get the space, I bet.  But there's a better way to make believe it's at night.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's the potential of it not being turned back on.  Right.  I mean, you know, at the same time, I have flaming red hair.  So people even who don't know me or even know necessarily what I look like, I go to the grocery  store and, you know, aisle 10 can see me from aisle one.  And, you know, that's kind of upsetting sometimes.  That's a good one.  You know, you do what you can. 
[02:40:00]  The people that know you, that know what you do, the people, like, think automatically have  these misconceptions about what you do.  Everyone.  See?  Yeah.  Everyone.  Everywhere.  She's talking like she's a...  You're not James Lipton.  She's an Oscar winner.  You're talking to a dumb stripper.  Yeah.  I'm sure she's a nice person.  He's doing this interview like, yeah, like an A-lister is coming up.  Right.  And she's answering like she's an Oscar winning actress.  She put her head back.  She goes, oh, all the time. 
[02:40:30]  It's like he just asked her, you know, now when you, when the paparazzi is chasing you  around, uh, when you're signing all those autographs and the flashes are going off at  the premiere and she goes, oh God, yes.  Oh yes.  No.  He's talking about, you know, the people that do, you know, you do, you know, the three  people.  So you're not, you're not looking for this stripper to be unmasked.  This is why.  No.  This is our frustration with strippers, by the way, because somewhere along the line,  they've tried to make it way more than it actually is.  Yes.  Yes.  And like I said, I'm sure she's a nice person. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  But treat her.  But tell some stories.  Kindness.  When you partied and then let us see your food.  But you take your fucking clothes off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like the white scarf she's wearing.  And you grab dollars with your tits.  I mean, what are you trying to, why are you trying to fancy this shit up?  Well, she is fucking beautiful.  Of course she is.  Wow.  Back, back, back.  Yeah.  A little more.  A little more.  We give extras.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey.  Timmy's like, name some clothes.  Oh, Gil, quiet down over there. 
[02:41:30]  You'll never come back again.  It very much is not, in my opinion, a sexual thing.  I don't look at nudity as necessarily a sexual thing.  It's very organic.  And it's natural.  And it's kind of defiant.  Let's grow a gun.  Shut up.  Okay.  Naked?  Let's be organic.  We got the, we got the blur screen, right?  We can do that.  A naked garden?  Yeah, I don't know.  Okay.  So, it's not like, it's not like, you know, you're just doing, it's a job to you, in other 
[02:42:00]  words, pretty much.  It is, but it's, it's a performance.  Jim, have you ever been on, like, a late night talk show, where the host has to pose the  question, do we have the blur screen, if we need it, so we can get naked?  I've never seen, any, anytime I've ever done a talk show, I've never seen the host clumsily  fumble in such a fashion.  This is, this is, you know this is, it's, he's clumsily fumbling instead of you.  And why are you talking to her?  Like, if she performs and dances, even if she has her clothes on, that'd be pretty fucking 
[02:42:30]  sexy, right?  Yeah.  She's really hot, she has a nice body.  Wow.  You can get, knock her down to her, uh, her bra and panties, probably, or tell her to bring  a fucking bathing suit with her.  Yeah.  Why are you still talking to her?  Sponsors.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if Dunkin' Donuts would like that.  All right, let's, uh, hear her answer.  Someone's saying she's not a stripper, she's from Dancing with the Stars?  What?  Huh?  No, she's not from Dancing with the Stars.  She's got bright red hair. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Who said that?  And she was talking about being naked.  Yeah.  She's a stripper.  They have clothes on on Dancing with the Stars.  What dummy said that?  Mikey did.  Mikey.  Mikey.  What are you talking about, Mikey?  You dummy.  She's from Dancing with the Stars.  She's not a stripper.  Oh?  Yeah.  I gotta fucking look this up.  She's not a stripper.  Google it.  Google it.  All right.  Google it.  Google it.  I hope you're right, because we're going to look like assholes.  No.  I fucking hope I'm right, too, to be honest.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[02:43:30]  Hang on.  Yeah, there you go.  I think I found her Dancing with the Stars press shot.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It's her on a pole.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You dick.  You dick bag.  Yeah, and you know what?  She is not.  And now that I'm looking at her pictures, yeah, it's not sexual at all, right, guys?  No.  What the fuck is she talking about?  Nudity and a pole dance.  She's sucking on fucking lollipops, making believe it's a cock.  Man, there she is.  She's upside down.  There she is.  Trying to eat her own pussy.  Yeah, yeah, all right.  It's not sexual.  With Lorenzo Lamas there, yeah.  Right, right.  Pulling out some money to shove in her G-string. 
[02:44:00]  Christ.  Yeah, Dancing with the Stars.  What a buffoon.  It is what it is, man.  What are you trying to, like, make it more fancy and shit?  Oh, wow.  This must be her with Emmett Smith.  I know she's got a nice crotch shot there.  Well, that's how you get a 10 on Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  Show your pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Can we go back quickly?  We've got to get to the end of the Dancing with the Stars interview.  Yeah, hit it.  Is a British guy really that mean?  But you just saw all those pictures, and she's trying to say it's not sexual.  I know. 
[02:44:30]  She's performing this.  Shut up.  Yeah, here she talks about her performance.  It really is kind of my middle finger to puritanical doctrine, and I love that.  I love to upset.  I love to stir the pot, and I love to do what I'm going to do.  Go for it, Sibby.  Sibby likes to smoke the pot.  Another mindless interruption.  I told you.  Yet another witless piece of banality trampling his guest. 
[02:45:00]  It's just pointless yammering to confirm that he is indeed alive.  You heard her say stir the pot, right?  Yeah.  Smoke the pot.  Yeah, I thought that was a good tie-in.  They talked about stir the pot, and he had a pot joke.  But literally, I've never seen anybody who can destroy a flow with such utter ease.  He's terrible.  It had been well over 12 seconds since Scorch shined. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, my God.  That's what he likes to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My stomach hurts.  He on the fly, man.  He'll just throw him out there.  I think that was improv.  That was good.  He's a natural at this, Sam.  In his mind, he thinks he's on the short list to take over for Leno.  You know that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's waiting for his phone to ring.  Oh, he is.  Now, when Fallon's going, he'll be looking for somebody for 1230.  You had plenty of options for me.  Let's hear how he followed up that pot joke with Lacey. 
[02:46:00]  I didn't mean that.  If anybody's watching from the DEA or anything like that, just so you know, I'm only joking.  I endorse it.  The DEA.  If the DEA is watching, they're going to go, all right, good.  We got him.  Right.  We were watching PFG TV.  The DEA watching PFG and a bunch of Zs.  But listen to how long he's talking in the middle of her story.  Right, right.  It's not about you, dummy. 
[02:46:30]  It has nothing to do with it.  Okay.  Can you rewind that?  She's talking about you.  You want to see the whole interruption?  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  He's a dancer.  She's a dancer.  That's what she does.  Of course, she looks at it a certain way.  She's not going to go, yeah, I just show my cunt.  Like, you know, we all look at what we do a little more serious.  Yeah, she rationalizes it a little bit.  That's what we do.  That's what everyone does.  Right.  So while she's doing that, he just jumps in with a crass,  ham-handedly, witless piece of banality. 
[02:47:00]  It is just a clumsy attempt at being humorous and charming.  He's the fucking Kool-Aid monster of good jokes.  Just crashing through the wall.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I'm loving this.  All right.  I've heard a puritanical doctrine, and I love that.  I love to upset.  I love to stir the pot, and I love to do what I'm going to do.  Go for it, Simby.  Simby likes to smoke the pot.  So that's why you guys are close. 
[02:47:30]  It's good.  No, no.  I didn't mean that.  If anybody's watching from the DEA or anything like that, just so you know, I'm only joking.  I endorse it.  Simby has nothing to do with it.  Okay.  But he's so worried that he has such a huge viewership that it's very possible the DEA  is watching live, even though it's in the afternoon with the light coming through the  windows.  If you broke down your comedy to somebody, and you said, well, this is really like, and 
[02:48:00]  you were kind of taking it from your soul, this is exactly why I do it, and they interrupted  you to make a joke about smoking pot.  Well, that's the point, is that she was making a real point to her for herself.  You know, he asked her a question, so she was giving a real answer as to how she sees  herself as a performer, that she's saying, fuck you, the puritanical doctrine, as she  said.  You know, she doesn't, and then he interrupts with just a cheap, easy, clumsy wordplay joke. 
[02:48:30]  He smokes, oh, you stir the pot, he smokes the pot.  He smoked the pot, and then he goes, that's why you two are sitting together.  It doesn't make sense.  No, that's where they get it.  It's not that they're both smoking pot, or they're both stirring the pot.  The whole time she's been there, she's been trying to make the point that she doesn't  party like that.  Oh, he's not listening to any of that.  He is lost.  He's got his angle, and he's going to stick with it.  That's the reason you two are next to each other on the giant, shiny couch with the big  table in front of you.  And the scud sliding. 
[02:49:00]  That road has been paved, regardless of where he's going to say she goes.  In his eyes, fair enough, she's just a whore taking her clothes off.  Even though she's saying some stuff in there that he could go with.  This chick loves smoking pot.  Sleeps all day because, you know, she's been doing coke all night.  We all know it.  All right.  Marijuana?  Yeah.  Yes.  Without any questions.  Wait, what did she say about marijuana?  Legalize it.  Oh, legalize.  She wants to legalize. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  I got right.  Oh.  Okay.  It should be legal, though, don't you think?  What?  Yeah.  Yes.  Why did it?  That's how he recovered from interrupting her real answer for a pot joke.  Yeah, but it should be legal.  It should be legal, right?  He knew he'd get an applause break for that.  People want pot.  It should be legal.  It should be legal.  It should be legal.  I just love how he breaks it.  Yeah.  He's talking to the little scorch.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[02:50:00]  You understand, right?  Little scorch.  Little scorch.  You're with me, Rick.  That's why I got the big table.  I'm hiding little scorch.  Little scorch.  No, no, no, no.  I thought you'd be legal.  It's all right, little scorch.  But you'd be legal.  I love them.  They have giant chairs that they disappear in.  Right.  And it looks like the couch never ends.  It goes off screen to the left.  It's a giant couch. 
[02:50:30]  This set is visually upsetting.  It's an upsetting thing.  Yes.  Plus, I mean, as far as production value goes, you would absolutely zoom in.  So, you know, Sib's left shoulder is the left of the screen and Scorch's right hand.  This is where they shot a fucking...  Or his left hand, actually, as you look at it.  They shot hostile in this building.  Zoom in, you fucks.  Especially if you've got a hot chick on the couch.  The giant chair that Gallagher used to sit in and bounce on and stuff.  Yeah, the big prop giant chair. 
[02:51:00]  Little Scorch, you think I should zoom in?  They told me I should zoom in.  What do you think?  What do you think, little Scorch?  What do you think, little Scorch?  You know what little Scorch says every time?  You're doing great, Scorch.  You're doing awesome.  I know.  I know I am.  Little Scorch, you know I'm being great.  You're huge.  Huge, Scorch.  Ah, fuck.  Scorch, NBC, today's the day to call.  Think the letter's going to call little Scorch?  He's going to do it, Scorch.  He's going to do it, big Scorch.  I'm on the short list, right? 
[02:51:30]  He knows you better.  You've got it.  All right, let me get back to this interview.  I'll talk to you a little later, little Scorch.  You're doing great.  Okay, listen for the next question.  It's a doozy.  It's a doozy.  He's trying to impress little Scorch.  Yeah, yeah, little Scorch.  He's fucking teasing a bit to little Scorch.  Oh, giving him a bit.  If he would get a midget and make him look exactly like Scorch and just call him little Scorch.  Right, little Scorch.  You get it, big Scorch. 
[02:52:00]  That's his sidekick.  That's his little yes man.  Yeah.  Let's hear a little more of Big Scorch.  Legalize it.  Legalize it.  Tax it.  Make your money off it like you do everything else on God's green earth.  You know what I mean?  You pay $150 for a tank of gas.  He has a guest.  She's sitting next to him and she was giving a soulful answer and he interrupts with this fucking...  Because he made a ham-handed pot joke, he's now into legalizing pot. 
[02:52:30]  She's still in the middle of her ass.  Dude, this is what fucking high school juniors say to each other in the woods when they're drunk.  This is dreck.  It's really, really bad.  But he doesn't know what he's doing here.  Don't be afraid to get political, Big Scorch.  You like it when you get smart.  That's what I figured I'd do.  I was leading into a very serious discussion on legalization.  And I wasn't going to bring up the typical hack answers to legalizing pot. 
[02:53:00]  You know, legalize it.  Tax it.  Little Scorch, watch the applause break I get for this.  People love pot.  You got it, Scorch.  They love you too, buddy.  I really appreciate that.  I know it.  You know it.  Hopefully others do.  I would love to do a breakdown on this.  How many minutes during this interview does she talk and how many does he talk?  It's probably close.  Maybe she gets back to her answer because she is in the middle of it.  Let's hear it.  She is, right?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  All good. 
[02:53:30]  Do what you got to do.  But legalize it.  Leave me the hell alone.  Will you please?  You know what I mean?  Lacey doesn't smoke, and Lacey says legalize it.  Stibby zips his lip, but he says legalize it.  Gil's never touched the stuff, but never.  He said that's okay.  Now tell us about something.  The band shot.  The band that's set up all afternoon to play for two and a half seconds.  With all the cords on the floor.  Dude, you can see the vent in the door. 
[02:54:00]  The vent in the door.  You can see where the amps are plugged into that shitty socket in the wall.  Yeah, they look tired because they're just holding their uniforms, their instruments.  This is the worst show.  There's so much going on.  Hit it again.  Let's see where he goes.  Don't be afraid to go long on the pot talk.  Of course.  No, I didn't.  I know.  I'm a timing master.  Where are some of the smallest local yokel towns that have had strip clubs that you've danced at?  Oh, my goodness.  A lot. 
[02:54:30]  So there are like some really.  What?  There are horny guys everywhere?  I can imagine.  There are horny guys.  Wow.  I said to.  This is so uncomfortable.  Did you hear the one guy come?  One guy.  I'm horny.  Horny.  Yeah, horny guy.  I'm a wreck.  A little scorch.  You're horny, right?  Can you see her pussy from down there?  Nobody's even looking at her pussy, scorch.  I'm paying attention to you, buddy.  I knew it.  They're all here to see you.  I really needed to hear that because I wasn't sure.  She's good eye candy, you know. 
[02:55:00]  Dude, he's just trampling everything with nonsense.  It's just nonsense.  It's utter nonsense.  It's ramen noodles.  It's just throwing.  They're fucking verbal ramen noodles.  I love that they went for a shot of the band and they're just poor shitless holding their  estimates.  They've played for a total of two and a half seconds so far.  What, there are horny guys everywhere?  I've been to Paducah, Kentucky, Metropolis, Illinois, Three Forks, Montana, Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
[02:55:30]  Do you have fans that come back and see you at all these places?  Oh, no.  They don't want to see you when the show's over.  Oh, no.  No, but do they come back?  Surprisingly, I have a very huge female fan following.  Wow.  And I think that is because my shows are here for me.  I want to do my impression of me as the producer.  The first time we go to commercial.  Okay.  Sweetheart, can you step aside for a minute?  Yeah, yeah.  Step aside.  We've got a meeting. 
[02:56:00]  Okay, now you and you.  Yeah.  Here's what you both need to do.  Talk less.  But it's my show.  I understand that.  Scorch, PFG TV.  No, no.  I understand that.  But you are terrible.  Scorch, is it just me or is this producer?  I don't know what he's talking about.  You're fired.  And look, I understand you're the co-host.  And you're probably bankrolling this thing on your fucking, on your fucking, your producer's  money that you're making from the Boston songs you played on.  But please stop fucking interjecting terrible jokes. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, he'd had nothing there.  It's like, why would anyone want to see her after the show?  I don't know.  Go ahead.  I mean, they're more circus style.  They're more fun.  So is this show.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's like, yeah.  And it's so, wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, maybe if you let her finish her thought.  He's derailing everything completely.  He interrupted her answer without a question to go to.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  For another bad joke.  So is this show.  Yeah, yeah, shibby.  He could have, at that point, he could have just said, no, so go on.  Oh, my God.  And that's it.  And then he's all uncomfortable.  Like, you know, he's scrambling, thinking, trying to think of something.  So they go, okay.  He's got nothing right here.  Let's hear.  Let's hear how he recovers.  Okay.  But women, now, that's a whole other thing.  Women, and I started off, believe it or not, way back when, I DJed at Mark's. 
[02:57:30]  Not Mark's.  No, we believe this.  He makes it about him again.  Stoughton, Massachusetts.  Okay?  Way back when.  I mean, seriously, I'm talking 1984.  I wasn't born yet.  Oh, whatever, Lacey.  You know.  That's a highlight.  Take it for the highlight reel.  Where I say, whatever, Lacey.  We'll use that as a promo.  You know, Scorch, technically, that was your apology.  Yeah, I know it.  I'm bringing the laughter.  Put that on our demo tape. 
[02:58:00]  Put that on the reel.  For NBC.  On the NBC reel.  Yeah.  Not afraid to be self-deprecating.  That's why people like you, Scorch.  Exactly.  You know it, little Scorch.  Little Scorch.  Interview just as quickly as you.  I'll tell you what I can do.  I will talk about some of the things you told me not to talk about.  Break in.  Break in, right?  But, but, but, uh, 84.  They didn't even shave back then.  I love it, man. 
[02:58:30]  God bless you.  Good.  Hold on.  Word.  It's nice that he comes in with his, just the creepy.  The fucking.  That was really creepy.  The absolutely creepy comment.  84.  They didn't even shave back then.  And by that, I mean their pussy hairs.  Yeah, exactly.  That's, that's a guy who spent a lot of angry moments staring up.  He's been, he's nursing a beer, staring ragefully at their crutches over the years  that one he can't have. 
[02:59:00]  You know how many times more than a feeling is played?  And he's like, you like this song?  And he'll start like drumming on the table.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You hit the list of this part.  I think, uh, Louie's on his way, just so you know.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Uh, yeah, good.  One more?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And I had to give Lisa, she shaved this afternoon before she came here, so it's good, you know.  In there or something, in there.  But, uh, it's, it, you tell him.  That was Scorch's way of protecting them from the censors.  Right. 
[02:59:30]  Making motions to his face.  Right, right, right.  Like she shaved.  So that way the censors wouldn't think it was a pubic drink.  Get it?  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  The censors for this show.  Holy shit.  That's because he's hoping to get a razor blade company to sponsor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  To what?  Yeah, what is that in pieces?  Good one, Scorch.  Good.  Good recovery, Scorch.  Nailed it again.  Thank you, little Scorch.  I appreciate that.  By the way, he's gone on three different fucking tears during her story. 
[03:00:00]  He's, he went that, and then he was talking about, well, I was DJing at some place.  Never finish that story.  No.  And now he's on, on the pubic hit.  No, he never finished that.  Oh, I thought he did.  Now he's trying to, now he's trying to scrambling again for another question to answer.  And she's still not moving her, her body.  Yeah.  They're valueless tangents.  Get her on that giant table.  So would this be the Steve Martin have a point speech moment?  Yeah.  Have a point.  He's scrambling.  More interesting to the listener.  He's scrambling.  You know what he's doing? 
[03:00:30]  He's filibustering.  He just is talking.  As long as he's talking, he's, he's still continuing the, the filibuster.  When is she going to like demonstrate pole dancing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did you get to know her?  All right.  Let's see how he recovers.  One of the weirdest experiences you've had on the stage.  Oh.  Good question.  I don't even know where to start.  All right.  We got.  Start.  Louie.  Louie CK.  What's up, Lou?  Hello, Lou.  We were watching a hit show here.  Yes.  We're learning from Scorch. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's not worth getting into.  Trust me.  It's a guy we used to do radio with and he decided to put on a talk show that is, you  know, he thinks it's reminiscent of Johnny Carson.  He thinks he's Johnny Carson.  Utterly and completely bad.  He's just interrupting and just going off on just fucking horrible tangents.  His guest is a stripper and he's scrambling for questions.  Yeah.  He's not prepared.  He's got no sense of humor, no sense of timing.  That's the best thing you can watch.  The shit is terrible.  And it's, I can't stop watching it. 
[03:01:30]  Look at how the window did you move.  Yes.  And it's supposed to be live at night.  Live at night and he can't even like hide the sunlight.  I don't do betine in black tape for fuck's sake.  That's a five minute fix.  Just pull it down.  Aaron, could you please just back it up a little and play just a little bit.  Look at the table.  The size of the table.  To see the set and everything.  You got to appreciate the giant table.  It's just, it's just.  Oh my God.  The Lillian's fantastic.  Oh my God.  The reflection off of the leather. 
[03:02:00]  The giant intrusive table.  The name of the show should be Behind the Table.  Should be Look at this fucking table.  It's terrible.  And then the table goes in.  Yes.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  The white shining on the, there's just somebody had no idea.  And then the sun and light coming through.  And then he has a band.  He has a house band.  And they played into break for two and a half seconds.  And look at that rug.  That fucking fake.  Everything is perfect.  But isn't that a sidekick? 
[03:02:30]  The guy with the glasses?  Yeah.  That's Sib Hashin.  He's the drummer from the band Boston.  Yes.  Years ago.  Oh, that's your sidekick?  That's his sidekick.  I know.  I don't take the lead singer.  He's a kid.  He's a kid.  And play a little bit.  So you can see the chemistry.  What part?  The chemistry.  The magic.  Jesus.  That happens.  Yeah.  I brought it back a little bit.  Sorry.  Recap.  She's a stripper.  Ah, yeah.  There we go.  She's a stripper.  All right.  All right.  He's acting like he's James Lipton trying to get something done. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  With this interview with the stripper.  Yeah, but James Lipton doesn't have the patience to wait for an answer.  Of course not.  He just asks questions.  He trudges through.  All right.  I love it, man.  God bless you, you know.  Oh, my God.  And I had to give Lisa.  She shaved this afternoon before she came here.  So it's good.  In the air or something.  Yeah.  But tell us more about some of the weirdest experiences you've had on the stage.  Oh.  Oh, he's just kidding.  I don't even know where to start. 
[03:03:30]  Anybody ever, like, you know, attack the stage and try to come get you?  Anybody ever?  That's a great, that's a fun talk show question.  Have you ever almost been raped at work?  That's a funny story.  You ever been that dramatized?  Can you slow things down and tell us?  You got any humorous anecdotes about being double penetrated by a dumpster?  Do you ever have a gun put in your mouth or you're being fucked?  How did you get the job?  Did you have to do something awful?  What was that like? 
[03:04:00]  What do you have to do about once a month to keep your job?  How's that feel?  But he answers the question that she's not ready for.  So she thinks for half a second and he just tramples it.  But then the water's right over her.  Wait to hear the interruption.  She has no time to think.  He interrupts his own question.  I can't get enough of this, though.  It's just great.  What happens?  It's not because of who I am.  It's I think they worked up for anybody. 
[03:04:30]  Anybody?  Anybody?  As you look around, was it anybody in this room that did that by chance?  I don't know.  Some of those look familiar.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Actually, you know what?  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  I know what you mean, Scorch.  Simby, what are you doing?  Get your head out of her lap.  Oh, man.  Hey, there's another.  There's a matching end table to this.  Yeah, I didn't notice that.  That's giant.  Oh, that's great.  That's always good if you want to fucking bring out like thingy balls like Captain Queeg had. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, they won't fall off.  There's a strawberry.  Yeah, you could put fucking softballs on there.  It's a shuffleboard.  You know what this set needs?  This set needs a hibachi in the middle of it.  You know, you could pour a whole container of mercury out and that would never end up on the floor.  A matching table.  A porn set designer would be like, no, we can't use this.  What are you talking about?  This looks awful.  No one would believe this.  These episodes come out every once in a while.  Yeah, and we just love them.  So we had to take a look at it.  Love them. 
[03:05:30]  And we pick apart every little thing about ours.  And his name is Scorch?  Scorch.  His open is Santa Monica Pier.  But he's doing this in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Manch Vegas.  Manch Vegas he calls it.  But he's got stock footage of the Santa Monica Pier and he puts his credits over it.  Like, live, tonight, and it's Santa Monica Pier.  Like, it's so...  This is going on in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Manchester.  Supposedly on this episode he says he has more viewers than Game of Thrones.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, definitely. 
[03:06:00]  Game of Thrones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It talks about the millions of people that watch his show.  Millions.  I can't get enough of it.  Even though the YouTube video can only get 136 views before we get a hold of it.  Yeah.  Look how that white light is burning the video.  Like, it's just...  Just sconces.  Oh, no.  It's so bright.  It's just...  I love every bit of this production.  Yeah, the fucking Mr. Gazzo talk show host.  His fucking co-host.  Rocky's whole fucking boss. 
[03:06:30]  That's why he can't hook you up with Gazzo.  Yeah.  He's busy on the show.  He's on the PFG TV.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, so what have you been doing, Louie?  Look, you know, you got someone like Scorch.  He's doing PFG TV.  Right.  He's a mover and a shaker in the industry.  I'm surprised you guys haven't hooked up yet.  I'm like, you guys got to hook up and do a project together.  Oh, my God.  And you know who you...  Don't you want to take this guy and, like, give him the Tonight Show?  Like, if you had the power to do that. 
[03:07:00]  Please.  I've always wanted to do that.  Like, take people who...  Like, some comic...  Like, there was a guy in Boston.  I'm not going to say his name.  It was just too mean.  But he was the guy who did the same five minutes for, like, ten years.  Oh, wow.  And I wanted to, like, have the power to give him an HBO stand-up special.  Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  Oh, shit.  And just fill a fucking theater.  And just...  And turn off the air conditioning and make him do an hour.  And put it on HBO.  And say, here's your shot.  And then he's like, I can't do it.  And then you go, good, so quit now. 
[03:07:30]  Get out.  It's this or get out.  You know what you always wanted or you have to quit.  You can't keep doing this.  You know what?  This is going to be great for Scorch because Scorch will absolutely say, well...  Well, let me tell you.  Louis C.K.  Oh, yeah.  He's talking about PFG TV.  Yeah, you're going to be part of the next show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we mocked him horribly.  He goes, you know who are big fans?  You know how he'll do it?  He'll make a joke about Louis and then he'll be like, oh, Edward C., he might be watching.  He might be watching.  Yeah, yeah, he might be watching.  How you doing, Louis? 
[03:08:00]  It's going to say that last time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How does he make a living, this guy?  He does not like this.  Exactly.  It's not this.  We worked at the same radio station in Boston.  We worked together.  And we've been kind of watching him ever since.  Many moons ago.  Wow.  He's hung in there.  He's in New Hampshire at a rock station.  Wow.  Where did you work with him?  In Boston?  Yeah, at AF.  Yeah, yeah.  He got fired.  You guys and him and Mark Parenteau.  Yes, Mark Parenteau.  And now everyone's gone their separate ways.  I actually have more respect for what Parenteau did with his life. 
[03:08:30]  It's not as embarrassing.  I know.  I know.  It holds up better on TV.  Treats his guests better.  At least they got an Xbox.  At least they got 10 bucks.  Yeah, exactly.  At least they got to play video games.  Good God.  Louis got the big HBO special coming out.  Got to make sure we get the word out.  April 13th, right?  That's right, sir.  Is that a week from Saturday?  A week from Saturday at 10 p.m. 
[03:09:00]  That's exciting.  The fucking posters are great, man.  I saw the bus picture and I saw the one in Times Square.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, this is the first time I had posters ever.  Really?  Really?  My show, they never did.  They call it an outdoor.  I just found out that they call it an outdoor campaign.  Because I never had one.  Never had one before.  My show doesn't have posters or anything like that.  So this is the first time I've done that.  Did you have any say in the poster?  Yeah, yeah.  They showed me a bunch of different things.  Yeah.  And I picked that one.  Because it is really good.  I notice it when I'm driving.  You can't not look at it.  On the subway entrances, they got those things.  So when I'm driving on the road, I see them. 
[03:09:30]  And they're very like, what the hell is that?  It's like, why would someone waste so much room?  Yeah, there's a lot of white.  And then I'm tiny in the thing.  That's what I like about it.  Yeah, you're just in the bottom.  All this white behind you is fucking great.  That's very cool.  Who would present that and think you wouldn't say, you're wasting so much space?  Like, that's how dumb.  I have no clue.  Because obviously it works.  HBO has a great design department.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, it's really smart.  No, you need a lot more shit in there.  See, I would have put Louie with a bunch of red-headed guys and then had him shake and put his  hands up like, ah, what the heck? 
[03:10:00]  Ah, what am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  I guess I'm just one of these kinds of guys.  These kinds of guys.  Hey, that's a good idea.  Can I steal that?  I'm going to use that as a promo on my next show.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, but you can't not look at it.  All that white and just you at the bottom.  And I first saw it on a bus and I was like, that is fucking great, man.  Yeah.  I just hope the special doesn't suck.  Oh, come on.  I'll find out on Saturday.  I'm sure it's good.  I saw the moment of it.  Yeah, but that's what everybody said about every shitty special ever.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it's great. 
[03:10:30]  It's got to be good.  It could easily suck.  It's totally impossible that it sucks.  Well, the managers or friends have never said that about a special.  Like, I shot a special.  That's probably shitty.  It probably stinks.  Jimmy just filmed his in Boston.  We went up there for that.  How did it go?  It went really well.  Summerville Theater?  Yep.  You actually made me feel better because I was so panicky about the fucking lack of smoke.  And I asked Louie.  Because that's what they do is to get, like, lighting a certain way.  And I'm like, dude, I can't use smoke.  And he's like, well, I've never used it.  It's so stupid.  Never used it once.  And that actually is the only thing that made me feel better. 
[03:11:00]  I meant to write you and tell you that.  The only thing that made me feel better about it was him saying.  Well, that's because the people that are into the photography, those things, they fill the room with smoke.  Yeah.  So that it has more atmosphere.  And it's a giant waste of money.  It's stupid.  And, you know, the look it gives doesn't mean anything.  Doesn't mean anything.  I never did it.  I've done five of these now.  Never did it.  Well, Nicolas Cage gave you some advice, too, about the smoke, didn't he?  Oof.  No.  I don't know that part of our business.  He just blew me off completely.  He was on a plane sitting right next to Nicolas Cage.  Yeah.  Trying.  And you asked him if you should use a smoke machine? 
[03:11:30]  I was just saying.  Here's what that was.  Louie's fucking laughing his balls off of Jenny's dumb question.  Believe me, I would have had more respect for myself if I asked Mohamed Atta that on a flight.  Oh, my God.  You've got to give him the short version of the whole story because it's amazing.  I know it.  I already know it.  Of course you know.  Hey, I'm a big fan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, you're really great.  Yeah, thanks.  It's nice.  Okay.  I'm a comic.  I don't know.  Yeah, no, I guess so.  Yeah.  I don't know who you are. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Listen, can I ask you a question?  Yeah, I guess so.  And then he finally has to take off the headphones, Nicolas Cage, and face you.  Now he has to take off the headphones and face you.  Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.  I'm doing a stand-up special.  I'm not sure what that is, but go ahead.  Should I use a smoke machine?  I don't know why you're asked not.  I'm an actor.  Louie was on the plane.  I don't know why you would ask me that.  No, Louie just made Nicolas Cage like me a lot more than he actually did.  I wish that was the story.  He actually would have acknowledged me.  Wow. 
[03:12:30]  It was just humiliating.  Why did you ask Nicolas Cage?  Why did you use a smoke machine?  I'm a small man trying to make a connection with a movie star.  He was trying his best to get into a conversation.  And before he said anything, and there were like three or four or maybe even five attempts  at this conversation cross-country.  And before each attempt, Jimmy would play out the scenario, and it would always end with  Nicolas Cage going, yeah, here's my number.  Get in touch with me.  And it always ended with just, huh?  Huh? 
[03:13:00]  It was a fucking five-hour humiliation.  Slash validation of what I heard you know.  That was truly amazing.  You were just trying to get a picture, and you didn't get the picture.  No.  I got an autograph.  He finally gave him an autograph.  But you shot in the, I saw a clip on HBO shows, like, what's coming up, and they fucking,  it looked amazing, because you shot it in the round in the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix.  Yeah, the Phoenix.  Fuck.  You went in the round.  Yeah, Carlin shot a special in there in 77.  Oh, yeah.  And it's beautiful.  And the room is exactly the same.  It's never changed. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, so I got, it was about 2,800 seats or something, which is just what I've been  doing.  Right.  And also, I'm just sick of this same thing of, like, there's the guy with the curtain  or whatever fake set, and then you kind of come around awkwardly behind him, and you  see the crowd in the distance.  And I don't like lighting the crowd.  So this way, they're all around.  They're just all around you.  And the crowd is a backdrop, like, everywhere you see me, you see people fuzzy in the background,  just a fuzzy kind of, looks like a cartoon when they show an audience in a cartoon, just 
[03:14:00]  smoshy, fuzzy colors.  But how did you feel on stage in the round?  Isn't it?  I loved it.  I did it.  Is it vulnerable, though, a little bit, or?  It's just totally different.  I did it in Hyannis.  They have the melody tent.  Right.  I've done the round a few times a year for the last few years, and then it's totally  different.  It's a thing where the audience, you're always facing somebody, and you walk in a circle.  It's more natural in life to make spirals and circles than straight lines.  Yeah.  So if you just give into it that way, it's really cool. 
[03:14:30]  I've only done it a couple times, and it takes a little getting used to, though, because  you're always like, I've been facing my back too long.  Did you start thinking that way or no?  Well, yes.  That does.  A clock starts ticking.  As soon as you stop moving, you feel this heat burning behind you.  It's like being a rotisserie chicken, and you stop the rotisserie.  But the stage is burning, right?  It's rotating?  No, no, no.  Some places do that, but on the show, that would have looked retarded.  Oh, yeah.  Radio City.  Not Radio City.  Fucking Westbury.  Westbury does that.  Westbury does that.  I saw Bob Saget in the round, and the stage.  And Dyson.  Yeah, the stage slowly moves. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, you can't film that.  No, you can't.  And the thing I learned, because I did a show in Sacramento the same week, they have a round  theater there.  I did that just to get used to it.  But there's a few things, like when you're on stage, in a regular stage, you want to  come up to the audience, to the lip of the stage.  But in the round, the closer you get to the lip of the stage, you're eliminating more and  more people.  If you're standing on the lip of a stage looking out at the audience, you're looking at maybe  20% of the audience, and 80% of them are now behind you.  Wow.  So the only place to be is either on the back, like standing on the lip of the stage with 
[03:15:30]  your back to the, you know what I mean?  Right.  But you're actually facing more people.  That would make sense.  Yeah, you're on the lip of the stage.  Now, if you turn around and face the center of the spindle, now you've got the whole audience  there, except for who's right behind you.  There was a guy, when I did the show in Sacramento, that theater does, they do theater, they do  plays in the round.  And the guy who runs the theater said to me, the two power spots are the center of the  stage, and you're back to an alley, to an entrance alley. 
[03:16:00]  So I figured that, but then the whole other thing is the cameras.  Because if you keep moving, which is your instinct, you're just, you're not getting any cameras  as shot at looking at you for very long, but I had eight cameras all placed around, like  a gun turret, kind of, and you just keep moving around.  Interlocking fields of fire.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  It's a triangulation of fire.  Was it easier or harder to edit like that?  It was weirdly easier, because there was always a camera that I was looking at full on, and 
[03:16:30]  I could cut constantly without noticing.  Right.  It's like a rotary engine, like a Mazda rotary engines.  Very cool.  The spark plugs catch the cylinder as it goes by.  I saw Pryor, when he was, like, 1995 in Westbury, and he was in the round.  Was he spinning?  Yeah, because he was so slow, he couldn't.  Really fast.  Yeah.  That's what he should do.  Spin it to the point where the comic is literally hanging on.  Yeah.  And screaming.  For fear of flying off into the audience.  They put a plastic piece of clear plastic, and then he was like a subterfuge against the 
[03:17:00]  fucking man.  Did I say that right?  I hope so.  Centrifuge?  Yeah, I meant that.  Subterfuge.  Yeah, subterfuge.  It was like, yeah, underhanded.  Yeah.  Tunt I am.  So, Nicholas Cage, did I use the right word?  Huh?  Huh?  What?  But he had cards on the floor.  Go ahead.  It was kind of hard to see, because he couldn't remember.  So he had all these cards, and he was just kind of spinning slowly.  It was really sad to see.  What year was that?  95, 96.  Maybe earlier.  Yeah, that's pretty.  Subterfuge.  What about the old TV show there, Louie?  When? 
[03:17:30]  Come back in next year.  Next year.  May of next year.  You just decided, bah!  Take a year off.  Nice.  Everyone else does it.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, that's a hard show to do, and all the jobs I do on it, so I kind of was starting.  I felt like the last season was good, and the next one would not be.  Oh, really?  I feel like I'm on the precipice of a bad season.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And so I thought, maybe I could take a year off and spend more time.  I'm not taking a whole year off.  Yeah.  I'm only, I'm going to spend more time making the show. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, okay.  So I start work earlier.  But I had to reset it, hit a reset button.  Also, the shows, even though the show's not seen by that many, it's still a small show,  you know?  It's the frenzy about it, and the awards and all that stuff.  Yeah.  It wasn't good for the health of the show, to me, creatively.  I needed a year off from that.  Wow.  Yeah.  In order to keep doing the show, right?  That takes balls.  Did you get any flack from the people that want you to?  I mean, they're building like a whole thing. 
[03:18:30]  The show started kind of a whole comedy thing for them.  And then I had lunch with the president of the network.  Yeah, he didn't know why.  I'm taking him to lunch, and he's just, we're both having a great lunch, and I'm like,  here, I'm about to make his face change.  It's a weird feeling.  Oh, man.  So here's what I was thinking.  Oh, boy.  And you don't want to, leading up to it, and I'm seeing his, behind his eyes going,  what does this mean?  And so I kind of got, so what I'm saying is I need to take a year off.  And then I watch him take that, and he's a really, you know, courageous and great guy, 
[03:19:00]  John McGrath.  So he, oh, okay.  You mean in the show, your character is going to take a year off?  So we're doing an episode about taking a year off.  We're doing an episode where you're taking a year off.  I love it.  I love it.  No, no, see?  But so I got to do it, yeah.  You should have weighed, like, given him a worst option first.  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  I don't want to do the show anymore.  Yeah, I kind of want to quit and just get out of the business.  I'm tired of it.  What?  All right, maybe I'll just take a year off.  All right, fine.  Also, I had no idea.  You don't know with these people.  It might have been that he would have said, maybe you shouldn't come back. 
[03:19:30]  He might have said, don't you know, who knows?  They play their hand.  So it was tricky, but they were really supportive about us.  I want to bring it back as a musical like Cop Rock.  Yeah.  And then they go, no, I'll take a year off.  Yeah.  And I'll have some ground to make up.  People won't care as much, and the network won't care as much.  I don't know.  I think it'll be a tremendous, like a triumphant, not triumphant, but like coming back.  Like, the Sopranos took over a fucking year every time.  People take years off, and when you do it, it feels like this thing.  But then once it's over, it doesn't feel like anything to anybody. 
[03:20:00]  Nobody cares anymore.  Right.  It's just television, so it's not like I'm the police department taking a year off.  It's just a fucking TV show.  We just feel like we need a little, we're going to do something else for a year.  So everybody, just good luck.  Try to be good to each other.  Keep your doors locked.  Call the fire department if you really need somebody.  No, they took a year off, too.  Oh, shit. 
[03:20:30]  But now I'm really hungry to get back, and I miss it a lot.  So I hadn't felt like that.  Are you writing, though, during the off time?  I'm trying not to write at all.  You're trying not to just do anything?  Not even think about it?  As far as the show goes.  No, it's a thing I've learned to do is to think like a farmer or something.  Like, just take, don't rip the shit out of the ground yet.  You've got to rotate your crops and keep the soil or you'll have a dust bowl.  But being a creative guy, doesn't something pop in your head?  You're like, oh, wow, that would be a great episode. 
[03:21:00]  If I have a germ of an idea like that, I email it to myself with a heading show idea.  So I have a bunch of those.  And then just leave it alone.  And then I leave it alone and don't develop it.  And then I've been concentrating on the stand-up.  It's something I learned about sharks at an aquarium with my kids.  Sharks can't stop moving.  You know why?  I only kind of figured around.  They don't have those moving gills parts.  They can't push water.  They need the actual water to go in their mouth and out their gills, so they've got to keep moving forward. 
[03:21:30]  It would be like if you didn't have lungs that expand and you needed to just walk and have air come in.  If your flag motion controlled your diaphragm.  You'd have to bend over and run to get air to come in.  What a horrible design.  Oh, the good fucking air in your mouth.  Like a scoop.  Like a hood scoop.  Sharks suck.  So, you know, they're really dumbly designed.  So even if they stop moving for a second, they start choking.  Yeah.  So, but they need to sleep just like every neurological thing needs to sleep. 
[03:22:00]  So they sleep their brain in sections, in quadrants.  They sleep like a quarter of their brain here.  It's like Jimmy.  A quarter of their brain.  There's stuff you can catch.  Sometimes you'll see a shark.  I mean, I've never seen a shark.  But you could happen upon a shark who's asleep.  Yeah.  And he doesn't, he's not looking at you.  He's just only doing motor skills, whatever it is.  And then he wakes up.  Would he go right by you if he was sleeping like that?  I don't know that much about it.  I just want, there's only one follow-up question.  Let's go.  Unless you nudge him.  Could you put sleepy shark in the Google? 
[03:22:30]  I want to see if this video was sleepy shark.  Okay.  So, so I figured out, I had this idea.  Okay.  If you sleep certain sections of your brain, like you just shut down.  Because I do all, I'm always overworked.  So I thought if I just don't, if you have the discipline to not think about certain things,  to not use certain, like don't do any logistical scheduling stuff for like, you know, several hours.  Don't even think about it.  Only think about this thing that you're doing.  And then you swap it out.  So the show is gone from my head for like this whole several months. 
[03:23:00]  And then when it comes back, it'll be very rested.  But meanwhile, I've been doing a stand-up special.  Right, right.  I'm working really hard, but not at the show.  Don't you feel like I'm always afraid if I get an idea and I don't write it immediately,  that I'm going to look at it the next day and hate it.  Like I go back over certain ideas and I'm like, oh, you fucking stink.  Like if I don't write it out in that moment, I panic that I won't feel that same emotion for it.  Some stuff is like that, I think.  But I don't write properly like for a stand-up unless I'm on stage.  I can't come up with stuff.  So I don't, and I avoid thinking about that until I'm going to be on stage. 
[03:23:30]  So you don't want to see my notebook in parentheses where I say funny face.  It would be a stroke of luck if some guy coming up with a new show found Louie's e-mail  and all these ideas from Louie's e-mail.  It's like, this show's great!  Critically acclaimed!  Oh, it sucks.  How are the kids, man?  They're great.  They're great.  I took them to school this morning and they're good.  We just had spring break and we had Easter and I had all their friends over for Easter. 
[03:24:00]  They're still at the age with coloring the eggs and everything.  Huh? Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Easter bunny and all that.  You like doing all that stuff?  Yeah, I don't like special occasions.  I like daily life.  Right, right.  That's more important.  You know what I mean?  The day-to-day shit.  The thing with the gifts and the thing, all that.  Christmas is really something, you know, but it's stressful.  Huh.  But I like the daily life, you know.  Like I've had girlfriends that didn't, I don't want to, I don't make everything about  Valentine's Day and birthdays, but I'm very generous, you know, and give them a lot 
[03:24:30]  of stuff.  Just be nice all the time.  Yeah.  Are the kids annoyed at how famous you're getting?  Yeah, because people come up to me when they're with me and they hate that.  They do, right?  And now I'm on buses and shit and that's weird too.  They don't mind that.  They think that's funny.  Right.  But yeah.  So they roll their eyes a lot?  They don't mind that to me.  Somebody, yesterday I was in the car with my daughter and this guy comes up to my window,  knocks the window.  And he's a cop.  He's got, he's a weird, even more, he's not a uniform cop. 
[03:25:00]  Oh shit.  He's got a gun on his belt.  He's got like his jacket on his arm.  So he's an undercover cop with a badge and gun on his belt.  Yeah.  And, you know, detectives also have a dark way about them.  Yeah.  And he knocks on my window and I'm like, what the fuck, guys?  I don't know why.  And I roll that away and he goes, you're fucking hysterically funny.  You're fucking hilarious.  And then he looks in the back seat and goes, oh, I'm sorry.  But yeah, they get annoyed because nobody has any respect for them when they, if I'm talking 
[03:25:30]  to one of my kids, people walk right, like stand between us and say, can I have a picture  with you or something?  Yeah.  How do you know that?  I just say, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  I used to be apologetically, no.  No.  You know what?  No.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But then I go, no.  Like, why would you ask me?  No.  I'm weight meaner.  Fuck, I saw Louis CK.  No.  No.  I saw Louis CK today.  What a fucking dick.  Yeah, let him say that.  I bet a lot of people go home like that.  I decided that that's okay with me.  I decided that that's the worst case scenario. 
[03:26:00]  That's fucking great.  God, that's real fame.  Met him once.  Damn.  He's a dick.  Really?  Why?  I asked for his picture and he didn't give it to me.  All right.  Well, I guess he's a dick.  So what was...  No one ever asked, like, what was the situation?  Well, he was talking with his kids.  His daughter's crying.  And he's putting a band-aid on her knee.  And I took her leg out of his hands and threw her across the yard and said, can I have a picture?  And you know what the cocksucker said?  No.  No, you can't have a picture.  It's a dick.  Yeah, you never bother someone with their kids. 
[03:26:30]  Even I wouldn't do that.  No.  And you're a fucking total pest.  Never.  When they're eating with their kids.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't fault anybody for asking this because they want a thing and they are fans.  It's nice of them.  Yeah.  Not on any level, of course.  But I don't want to do it, so I just say no.  But I've had problems with girlfriends over the years because if we're at an appearance  or something where there's a lot of people that are there for us.  We're going to relate to Louis right now.  In a microcosm of an appearance we're doing.  You know, we had to actually go to where the fans were.  Right.  Microcosm on purpose.  Petri dish.  Yes, a Petri dish.  But, like, girlfriends would get kind of like, I mean, they know that they're there to see 
[03:27:00]  you and shit, but they completely ignore them.  They'll step with their back and, like, back into them to get in between you.  It's very, yeah, disrespectful.  Yep.  Yeah.  Well, in that case, you're at work.  You're literally at a job.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  So they should just go get a drink in a corner and wait until you're done.  Hey, bitch, this is my fucking livelihood you're dealing with.  You didn't have to call her name.  All right.  Just tell her. 
[03:27:30]  Just tell her that she probably was.  Stupid.  I think we all need an update on the boat.  Will you be boating this summer?  I need to know.  So the boat, they got dug out of the pile.  Yeah.  It was heavily damaged.  There's a lot of holes in the fiberglass.  And it sat on its running gear in a parking lot.  You know, the running gear, the propellers, are so very carefully honed.  It's like a musical instrument.  So it just sat on them with all its weight. 
[03:28:00]  It's not supposed to be like that.  No, so it's going to take some of the warm season to fix it.  I mean, I got insurance money, obviously.  The boat was only a couple months old when it happened.  So it'll be restored to full strength, and then I got to sell it.  Oh, really?  Because I got another one.  Did you?  You know what?  Guaranteed, it wasn't big enough.  It's great.  You want a bigger one?  Yeah, of course.  You never get a smaller boat.  I own two boats now.  I own two boats.  It's great.  Yeah.  You should take it out in fucking Amity, Long Island.  What size? 
[03:28:30]  It's 42 feet.  42?  Yeah.  And you're going to pilot this thing?  That's right.  Yeah.  It's a big fucking boat.  It's a big boat.  It's a big boat.  42 is a big fucking boat.  It's a trawler.  It's easier to manage because it's a trawler, so it sits in the water.  It's a displacement boat.  It's not a planer.  It doesn't plane up on the water.  So it just plows through things.  Does it have a big high fly bridge on it and everything?  Yeah, it's got a fly bridge.  It's got a huge tank.  I mean, I could take this thing down to like, you know, probably to Maryland somewhere for, 
[03:29:00]  you know, one take of gas.  I could take it all the way to an island somewhere.  Yeah.  It would just take a long time.  It's slow.  Much slower.  Can you go out into the open ocean with that?  Fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can.  I mean, the open ocean for us landlubbers, we think of it as just this one big, but there's  all kinds of, you know, areas and you have to, I could go to Martha's Vineyard or something.  I'm going to try this summer.  Okay.  That's that good first foray into like open water.  That's right.  Like cruising. 
[03:29:30]  That worked out great for fucking JFK.  That's right.  That's right.  You're doing great.  Take it around the fucking Hudson a couple of times.  Take the ferry.  Exactly.  Not only you.  That's great.  Is it just for pleasure boating?  Are you fish or anything?  I don't fish or anything.  I just really like being on it.  And I, this one has more livability.  So yeah, I'm probably going to, yeah.  I figured that where I'll be with the writing of the show, the first two weeks of July,  I have off.  So I'm going to take like a writer, like a floating writer's retreat and live by myself 
[03:30:00]  on the boat and go up to river.  You can take a boat up the Hudson river to like the, the great lakes and all the way to  Canada.  And it's called the great circle.  You know how jealous I am.  That's one thing I want to do.  I think Lewis and Clark proved that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's like a lock system you can go through.  It's like you just discovered it.  You know, by the way,  it's been known since 1785.  I will go, I will go up the Hudson river.  It's something I want to do.  Well, it feels very apocalypse now. 
[03:30:30]  Joseph Conrad.  Oh, that's great.  Just kind of put up the river.  Cause it's not a thing.  It's not like a treacherous ocean journey.  It's just moving.  And then throw an anchor once in a while, sleep on the boat.  The boat has, you know, full kitchen.  It's very, very, it's full of all the amenities.  It's got a little motorboat on it that you can take.  It's got us tender.  Correct.  Drop it in the water and you can go.  Yeah.  You won't be scared sleeping on that alone in the middle of the fucking.  What?  What is a sea monster going to come?  I don't know.  Creature from the black lagoon.  It's a billion bandits.  It's a billion bandits.  It's a billion Somali pirates.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[03:31:00]  There's a lot of, who knows?  There's a lot of places.  It'll just tie off and just chill out.  A lot of places.  Throw an anchor.  You know, our anchor is.  That's so great.  That sounds great.  Were you always into this nautical thing?  Or would you just kind of like.  I also like making trouble for myself because I can't afford it.  I cannot afford this boat.  No.  I bought it outright.  No.  And I'm not the kind.  I don't have that kind of money.  That's a lot of money.  You really.  If you're to buy a boat, you have to be.  You have to have tens of millions of dollars in the bank.  Yeah.  That's who my fellow boaters are.  Yeah.  The guy I'm buying it from. 
[03:31:30]  That I bought it from.  The new one is like, you know, he's a retired CEO of several corporations.  And I'm buying his boat and I'm like, I am a comic and I had a good year.  And I'm in debt.  I'm in debt now.  Yeah.  You don't buy a boat with how much money you have.  No.  It's because you can afford a boat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't buy a boat when you have as much as the boat costs twice.  You buy a boat when you have so much fucking money.  Literally your accountant is like, if you buy a boat, you can save a couple of bucks on your taxes. 
[03:32:00]  You should be able to buy 50 of the boats.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  And you still have an income.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking MC Louie.  It's going to be a fucking true Hollywood story.  Louis C.K.  We better promote the HBO fucking special.  Yeah.  People, please.  Yeah.  I need that money.  It's called Oh My God premieres April 13th on HBO at 10 o'clock.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  That was something you wanted to do, right?  Just you wanted to do a special, so you did it. 
[03:32:30]  I mean, an HBO special was one of those things that just for you was really important.  Well, I figured I would do another one this year one way or the other.  And I thought I'd put on my website like the last one because that worked.  It worked well for you.  Yeah.  So I figured I'll just do that again.  I knew I was going to do one because I knew I was going to tour this.  I had this whole tour.  Yeah.  And then HBO came around and they said, what are you doing with us?  And they said they would make it a big event.  Yeah.  And I said, I don't really want to do it because I have my own way of doing it now and I own  it and why would I, it's better.  They kind of have to match what you could do on your own. 
[03:33:00]  They gave me a lot of money and they gave me also that I could sell it on my website  just like the other one.  So this one's going to be on my website in September.  Jesus.  And it's, I get this the same five bucks and I'm not, you know, that's my own thing.  How do you feel that everyone else is following your lead now and doing it your way?  No, I'm not as aware of what other people are doing.  I don't know how well they're doing at it.  I don't know.  I don't think it works for everybody.  No.  No.  No.  Guys like Gaffigan, who has a great fan base.  A couple guys have done it.  There's certain guys that can pull it off.  A few guys have pulled it off.  But it doesn't work for everybody. 
[03:33:30]  It's not the only way or even the best way to do it.  No, but it takes a lot of the, it makes the networks thing.  It's a great thing because it really makes everybody, that's the next step for every  comic eventually, although a lot of us can't do it yet.  It's still like the next logical progression and it makes the networks harder for them  to fucking, to dictate what you do.  Well, here's, the thing is that you don't even, it doesn't even have to be exclusive  to, you know, like Gaffigan's and Aziz's are both on Comedy Central now, I think.  And Netflix, mine is on Netflix now.  The one I put on my website. 
[03:34:00]  And I was on FX and it was on, and now it's on Netflix and I still, I'm still, still selling  them.  But they keep selling.  So it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  And that's what HBO was really smart.  Cause I told him, I want to put it on my website.  That's all mine.  And, uh, uh, I don't care what you do with the rest of the video money.  And they were like, all right.  So did they make you name the boat, the HBO?  Like, yeah.  Okay.  How much you need?  Well, let me tell you a story. 
[03:34:30]  Exactly.  But, uh, yeah, it was really, cause I was in a power position making the deal.  So I was able to get a lot and get it and do it exactly the way I wanted to do it.  Good for you, man.  But, but I am happy it's on HBO instead of my website also, cause it's on, there's still  a lot of people.  I don't need everybody to know who I am, but people will stumble on it on HBO.  My thing that's on my website, no one's going to kind of happen.  Unless they know you.  Yeah.  It's not in the rack that you flip through.  Right.  It's just in its own thing.  So the HBO thing now, it's more promotion and stuff. 
[03:35:00]  How is the camera?  Because, uh, we were talking about cameras to use and, uh, we didn't use the red.  We used a decent one, but I just couldn't.  It was too much more money.  But you used it.  What did you use?  The, uh, I used an Alexa on the last, this last one.  That's like the best one, right?  That's what they shoot movies on.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Are you happy with how it came out visually?  Yeah.  It's the best looking one I've done, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it that much different?  Okay.  I don't notice a lot of that stuff.  The look of your, your, uh, taping was great.  I, I love how it came out, but I mean, it's, I was very happy.  I can imagine it could look even better than that, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  With, with the red is a better camera and, and that. 
[03:35:30]  It depends on how you want stuff to look.  And also some of it is the age of the thing.  The Alexa, uh, will age quite a bit.  In other words, when there's a new generation of televisions.  Oh, yeah.  It'll look really good.  It'll still look good.  The Live at the Beacon one I actually shot on like 4K, which is like a huge movie.  And then we downgraded it to like, you know, to HD.  But when there are 2K TVs, which are coming in a few years.  You're not going to lose resolution.  Live at the Beacon will look actually better than this one.  Because this one, the Alexa, it was smarter not to do 4K. 
[03:36:00]  It'll take 10 years for this special to look shitty.  The Live at the Beacon will look good for another 20 years.  Wow, man.  Yours will look really shitty in about five minutes.  And it sounds shitty already.  I'm just kidding.  I don't know, but when you see the Richard Pryor specials, they don't look shitty.  No, because they're on film.  They're on film.  Yeah, you can't beat that.  But you know what?  Carlin's one that I saw that made me want to do it there.  That one is in 77.  That was shot on some kind of beta, and it's really good. 
[03:36:30]  Is it really?  Kellner directed that, right?  He did all the fucking Rolling Stones stuff.  Yes, he did.  He's also got lenses, too, because the depth of field makes it look so professional.  Yeah.  When you get that background that's out of focus.  Yeah, it makes it look way better.  Yeah, it looks great.  See, I said extreme close-up all the time.  I don't want them to miss one expression.  Tee-hee.  Not one wink.  Cute little mug of yours.  Not one uncomfortable left eye fucking smattering.  Like when you say something kind of naughty, but then you look like...  Yeah, yeah.  Like I put my chin down and the eyebrows go up like, you guys know. 
[03:37:00]  You know what I'm saying.  That's what I'm calling it, actually.  Come on now.  Adorable.  Dot, dot, dot.  You guys know.  You're not going to let me get away with that, are you?  Because you know me.  I don't know the difference between shoot.  We shot it, she shot it in 24p.  Yeah.  I don't know what the difference...  They said it was good for what we were doing, but...  It's a frame rate.  24 frames per second is what movies are done in, and 30 is like live television.  So 30 looks like kind of glassy and live looking, and 24 looks filmy. 
[03:37:30]  It's kind of stuttered.  Yeah, it's hard to describe that, like, especially the new frame rate now, the, what is it, 48?  That's what, yeah.  The Hobbit was shot in like 50 different frame rates, and it's actually bizarre to look at.  Yeah, it looks, and you can describe it like, it looks like a soap opera.  It's like, it's got a soap opera look to it.  Well, like if you go to Europe and watch some on a PAL TV, like an old movie, you can watch  like Citizen Kane on PAL, and it looks like videotape.  It looks like you're looking at the people right in front of you. 
[03:38:00]  Like 80s porn, when that was shot in a video.  Yes, that's what it looks like, and it looks bad.  It looks cheap.  Yeah, I like it to look like film.  You know?  What did I see that was shot, it was an old movie I was watching, the same thing.  It was like, how the fuck did this, this looks like newer, why is it like that?  A lot of TVs come like that, and you've got to set the hertz rate on it, or it just looks  like fucking shit.  It's a great movie.  The technology is going so fast that it's all becoming just piles of versions.  Yeah.  No one knows how to use anything anymore.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Like when you get a new TV now, it's like, like you get, okay, my cable box also has 
[03:38:30]  Netflix, and Vimeo, and YouTube, and my TV has Netflix, and my Apple TV has all, they're  all on everything.  My fucking Xbox.  Everything I have has everything I have.  Yes.  Yes.  It's a fucking mess.  Like, it's a train wreck.  What are you, what am I using it on?  What am I fucking...  It's hard to focus on anything, because everything has just got so many different options.  Yeah.  You can't focus. 
[03:39:00]  I'm like fucking Netflix, I'm Hulu, I'll check out some Hulu shit.  Little Rascals ended up on Hulu.  I was watching some of that shit.  Fucking hilarious.  Hal Roach did not give a fuck about kids.  They'd fall off chairs and tables stacked up.  This ain't CGI in the 30s.  Kid falls down, cracks his head on the wall, and he's like, it's in the fucking shot.  It's there.  We're watching it.  I love it. 
[03:39:30]  He was feeding them.  Yeah, exactly.  During the Depression.  Three squares a day.  Parents are like, good, fucking climb up those chairs again.  Take two, Hal.  We don't care.  We'll make more.  While Stimey was on set, he could drink all the water he wanted from anywhere he wanted.  That was his gift.  His gift.  He was the toilet.  All right, don't get carried away.  What the hell do I know?  Frame rate?  You take the picture, you smile.  Am I right or wrong, Lou?  You got it right.  That's all that matters in life.  It sure is.  After all, regular Joe.  I hate regular Joe. 
[03:40:00]  I love regular Joe.  Yeah, regular Joe just tells it like it is.  You know.  It's a container of coffee.  What matters?  What really matters, regular Joe?  You know, what the hell matters.  Your family, your health, your happiness.  You take all the frame rates, Mr. Fancy.  What do I know?  Give me a container of coffee.  I'm on the job.  I'm good.  Look at you with your big cameras.  You give me a Polaroid.  Good jeez.  Yeah, we look at it right there.  A Polaroid.  That's great.  Oh, regular Joe.  I have to get out of here.  Why?  I would love to hang out.  I got my trainer.  What? 
[03:40:30]  Fuck him.  I can't.  I didn't go.  I had red eye last night, so I didn't fucking.  I got to go.  I know.  I don't want to.  If you want to hang out, I'll fucking listen on the way home.  I'll let you know how you did.  Is that why you look so good, the trainer?  I'm fucking cranked.  No, he looks so good because of the relative comparisons in the room.  Well, we can break and we'll figure it out.  Ah, that sounds like I hope he's leaving too. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  I have to.  I know.  Louis C.K., the Oh My God special on HBO, April 13th, 10 o'clock.  Fuck.  And gigs, obviously, just go to louisck.net for all the gigs.  All the shit.  Was there a lot of press to do today?  For real?  I did Howard this morning.  And us?  And that's it?  I'm doing Letterman today, too.  Ooh.  We're in good company.  This is my first time being a guest on Letterman.  You've never done paneling?  No.  I mean, panel after a little stand-up.  Right, right.  Wow, that's exciting. 
[03:41:30]  Who are you on with?  Rachel Maddow and Flaming Lips.  It's kind of actually a good show.  Are you the lead guest?  You should be.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, it's the first time doing that.  I fucking watched that.  Are you nervous?  What?  Are you nervous?  I mean, I yelled, fuck you at his theater in my show.  I saw that.  I don't know if he saw it.  I don't know.  Fuck you.  I don't know.  He said, hey, Letterman.  Hey, Letterman.  Fuck you.  And it was on television.  Oh, he knows.  Someone showed him.  I don't know. 
[03:42:00]  You should ask him first question out of the gate.  Did you see what I yelled, fuck you at your show?  How did you feel about what I said about you?  It's a character.  It's not like your real name or anything.  Totally.  No, this is real name.  No, no.  At least it's no.  See, I know.  I see.  Yeah, what the hell does that care?  I'm trying to remember.  I was listening to you guys were cracking me up.  I'm trying to remember what it was.  Damn.  Fuck.  You know, I can only listen.  I have two cars, all right?  Whatever.  One to get to each boat.  That's right.  That's right.  And this fucking stupid fucking company that you work for. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, wow.  We don't talk like that.  You didn't even have to say that we work for.  We knew what you meant.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's like you ever listen to Derek and Clive?  It's Dudley Moore and Peter Cook.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So there's this one where Peter Cook says, I wrote to the head of the BBC.  And I just addressed it, cunt London.  That's the greatest thing.  So, anyway, I have the first car.  You know, when you buy a car, you don't decide what kind of radio you get. 
[03:43:00]  First of all, it's the same fucking company.  It's the same company.  It's a merged two companies into one company, right?  Yes.  I know exactly where you are.  If you buy a car, you don't order the radio.  You get a car that was already in the world.  I don't think anybody on earth buys a car and then it gets made at the factory and sent to you.  Unless you're going to wait six months.  So you buy a car, you give the dealer your specs.  He finds an inventory car in the area.  So it's arbitrary.  It might be a serious radio.  I don't know why they're different.  Why?  It makes no sense that it's two different kinds of radios. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  So you get your car.  And the first one I got, it's got whatever.  I don't even know what the fuck, which one are you guys supposed to be on?  I know.  What are we?  We're on XM, but we're also on the serious best out package.  So I'm on the XM radio and then I want to hear Howard Stern.  I can't get him.  So I call and they go, there's a premium package for the Howard Stern.  You have to pay more for Howard Stern.  I'm like, but that guy owns half the company.  I don't understand why that makes any sense.  You merged.  And I tell the lady, that's ridiculous that I would have to pay more and that I have to make this phone call. 
[03:44:00]  Not just the money, but that I have to fucking go through this to get something.  That's in the fucking thing.  So she goes, well, we'll give you a month free because you're upset.  So I month goes by and then it goes, shuts off.  I'm like, I'm not going to do this every month.  So then I buy a second car and I get, I get the car and it's the other one.  And I have Howard Stern and I can't listen to Opie and Anthony, which I listen to every fucking day. 
[03:44:30]  So I call them up and I go, why?  And she goes, cause that's extra.  I'm like, wait a minute.  So they're extra.  I have to pay a premium to listen to Opie and Anthony in one car and a premium to listen to Howard in the other car.  How is this not a joke?  And I said to her, I own two fucking radios of both services.  Which means I am paying a license fee already, a full license fee for Sirius and a full license fee for XM.  You always fucking brag that you can move your subscription from why can't you make, why am I going to have to pay two premium fees to just listen to everything everywhere. 
[03:45:00]  That makes no fucking sense.  None.  And she said to me, their contracts make it, it's in their contracts that.  Ours?  Yes.  No.  She said, she's the person who answers the phone.  Fuck her.  She lied.  We want to be talking to more people.  She said, it's in your contract.  We're dying to be across the board.  We're begging to be across the board.  I know.  Of course.  I know that. 
[03:45:30]  There are so many more people.  I know that.  Yeah.  We could double our audience if they did that.  And by the way, if I pay, so I said to her, so wait a minute, if I, so those guys are getting extra money if I, if I, so that would mean that you guys would get paid extra if people, if more people sign up for the premium, which of course isn't true.  If they're going to lie about that, I'm going to say this.  Everyone that answers the phones at the XM Sirius customer service has molested children.  Yeah, you get to say it.  You get to just say it.  You get to say it.  With what we just said about, about cable and how many ways you can get everything, every way, every media company has to like fight to be, to make yourself a fucking pain in the ass to use is the dumbest fucking thing. 
[03:46:00]  Because I don't pay either premium service.  And as soon as my contracts run out on both cars, I'm not going to listen to satellite anymore.  I'm just not going to listen.  This isn't eight channels on the old Zenith television where I have to get up to change it.  If something's fucked up, I'll go to something else in a second.  That's exactly right. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  I'll plug it in my iPod.  I don't give a fuck.  It should be as, and that's exactly, you have to make it as easy as possible.  Everyone knows that that runs a company.  Let Shimmy say something.  Music is good.  Words and wisdom, Lloyd.  Yeah, music is on an iPad, iPod.  The one thing that fucking keeps people listening to this type of shit is live talk because you can't put that on your fucking iPod.  And the amount of complaints we get every single day.  It's really dumb.  Our Twitter accounts get complaints all day long.  How long ago did they emerge? 
[03:47:00]  Years.  We've been in the building four years, so at least four years ago.  Yeah, 2008.  And all those years they couldn't, like, how do they expect a customer to understand this?  It was a revenue stream that made sense for a while because they were getting extra money, but now it just doesn't make sense anymore.  No, and also, why are they entitled to that extra money?  If I can't decide which one I use, I can't decide.  It's totally up to somebody else what kind of radio I get.  Because they're both, look at that, Sirius XM.  Is it a Sirius radio? 
[03:47:30]  No, it's a Sirius XM.  That's what the company is.  It should be a Sirius XM radio.  We have an XM radio.  Oh, so can I just, wait a minute, but it's Sirius XM.  What the fuck are you doing?  It's a terrible business model.  It might make them a few extra dollars, but it enrages customers.  It gets everyone all confused.  And they're never going to see how many people they don't get because they're difficult or how many people actually allow their subscriptions to lap for that exact amount.  No, this is what I always, like, when I was in Australia, everybody told me that they watched my show.  And I figured they must be getting old versions of it because it doesn't air there. 
[03:48:00]  But they were watching the show, like, the week before because the whole country pirates there.  Here are weirdos kind of pirates.  There's not that many people that pirate here.  But in Australia, mom's and dad's pirate video because we're not letting them buy it because we're keeping it from them.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  We have shows that have been on the air here for, like, three years, and we won't even give them.  If they're given the option, like, everybody in the world is like, take my fucking credit card and just let me have the thing and I'll pay.  But if you're going to be a pain in the ass, fuck you.  I can steal all of it. 
[03:48:30]  So the whole country of Australia rips TV.  And I learned this.  So when I put my Beacon special, one of the big important things to me was it was globally available right away.  And they're happy to buy it, right?  So I told FX they should sell my show on my website.  And they said that we can't do that because we can't let other countries see it before.  Oh, boy.  But what they're doing, all those companies and this piece of shit fucking company that we're talking on right now is they're keeping money out.  It's a cage. 
[03:49:00]  It's keeping money out.  It's not keeping it in.  Right.  They think they're keeping money in, but they're keeping it out.  Yeah.  By the way, what you just said, that should be a fucking infomercial for SiriusXM.  It's fucking enraging how they don't see that.  Why would they do it that way?  It makes no sense.  So you know how long companies are doing business the same way before you decide to put something on your site and do it differently.  It's like nobody wants to do anything differently until someone does it and then everyone goes, oh, that's the way to do it.  Imagine having to buy a different TV for Fox News.  I do.  Fox, FX.  No.  No, you've got to buy a different TV that gets that.  And then you've got to pay a premium. 
[03:49:30]  The way radio and TV got so big was that there was nothing you had to do.  Right.  You didn't have to pay for it.  You didn't even know you were paying.  You're paying for it by watching advertising.  Right.  You didn't even realize that you were paying their bills.  Your time.  That you're doing them a favor by watching the shit.  The feeling was that you just click it on and there's all this amazing shit.  Your favorite music.  It's amazing.  Your favorite stars.  Great stories.  Movies that were just out.  It was amazing.  It's magic. 
[03:50:00]  It was free.  It really felt that way.  But now with the internet and with all this stuff and this shit and this subscription  shit, they're like, well, we need you to give us this and you can only have this part  and then you can only do that.  It's just, well, I'll get free.  I'm going to go find free.  Thank you.  And it's absolutely right.  They should make it fucking easier.  And their thing is, well, from a paid service, you get unlimited content and no commercials.  Okay, fine.  But still don't make it difficult once you're inside that area. 
[03:50:30]  You should be able, I don't have us on my car radio.  I am not listening to anyone on my car radio.  I don't either.  That's amazing.  Because my car came with a serious radio.  So I didn't want to bother with this shit.  And I could probably make a couple calls and get a VIP account.  And that's a pain in the ass.  Who needs it?  I just didn't want to.  I'm a regular person.  I'm like, this is not, you know, I don't know.  So I would, I seriously recommend everybody that can hear my voice, shut off the system  that is letting you hear it.  We hear this shit every fucking day from our listeners. 
[03:51:00]  And then the listeners that are hardcore and they understand that they need to pay for the  service to keep us alive.  They get so frustrated and go, look, I tried, but I'm just going to like get it for free somewhere.  And it's offset by the people who were paying for the other one.  That's the thing that's crazy about it.  And once I had two cars, I'm like, wait a minute, but I'm, I am, I am paying to have  both.  You nailed it.  Because I have an XM radio in my house, but there's serious channels that kind of like  now and I go, oh, that's right.  I can't listen to them in the fucking house.  And baseball and football.  What the fuck? 
[03:51:30]  Right.  You're so right.  Have everything.  And that's how you're a real competition to radio.  Just make it fucking easy as possible.  That's the first rule of business.  No, all companies that do the, I had a, I had a gym membership downtown at a place called  the Printing House Gym.  And it was fun.  How'd that work out for you?  It's a nice, quiet gym.  Like nobody ever went there.  Anyway, so one, one day they said, it's going to be Equinox that we're turning into an Equinox  in two months.  And I said, what do I have to do if I don't, cause I was moving.  They said, I said, do I have to do anything? 
[03:52:00]  Cause I don't want to be an Equinox.  And they said, no, just don't, just don't sign up.  You have to sign up.  It's double the fees, all this stuff, but you have to sign up.  If you want to keep coming, you have to rejoin.  So I said, fuck it.  And I left.  And then a year later I look at my credit card statement for the first time in a year and  I've been paying Equinox who I never assigned anything.  I never been a member of Equinox.  I've been paying Equinox membership fee.  That was double my fucking other gym fee for a year. 
[03:52:30]  And I call, I talked to my accountant and he goes, they do this all the time and it'll  cost, you know, it's a thousand.  They owe the $1,200 they owe me, but go try to get it.  It'll cost you more.  And they know that, right?  Yes.  So then there's an Equinox near my new apartment.  So I thought, you know what?  I call Equinox and I go, listen, you stole $1,200 from me.  Here's the deal.  It's worth it to me.  I'm an irate person.  I'll fucking sue you or give me a year free at Equinox gyms. 
[03:53:00]  And then I'll keep going after that.  And then you have me as a customer.  You earned your $1,200.  Otherwise I'm going to take it out of your ass at my own cost.  So they go, they say, we'll give you two months free.  I'm like, that's what you get to sign up for a fucking gym anyway.  So I fought them.  And finally I said, I relented.  They said that three months free.  And I said, okay, I'll do it.  So I sign up.  And then I go to the gym that's near me.  And they go, well, you can't go to this one.  You can only go to the one downtown.  So then I go, I remember saying to some young woman at the gym, I said, you need to know that 
[03:53:30]  I'm really controlling myself, but I want to be screaming right now.  So go get me somebody that I can get mad at.  I was saying to her, I'm like, do you hear my voice shaking right now?  I've been so fucked with and I'm so mad.  That seems like a psychopath, by the way.  So she's like, okay, sir, I will go get the manager.  So the manager comes and he goes, no, you can't go to any of the Equinoxes.  So I finally, somehow I get to a CEO of the company after like two months. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  And I get a call from a woman saying, I'm customer relations.  I get this message.  You're going to be very happy with what I'm going to tell you.  So I call her up and she says, we'll give you six months free.  And I said, I'm not doing it.  And she says, well, then I'm authorized to give you back your $1,200.  And I said, wait a minute.  Here's your choices.  Keep the $1,200.  Let me go free for a year and then I'll be a customer for like maybe 10 years.  Or you're just going to give me back the $1,200? 
[03:54:30]  Like, do you see how you're losing?  Does that make any sense to you?  She goes, that's all I'm willing to do.  Stupid.  Wow.  What fucking cucksuckers?  Just dumb.  That is dumb.  Dumb.  How do you not attack them on Twitter?  That's what I was threatening to, but I don't.  I love doing that.  I feel as weird.  That's scary to me.  But you know what?  You're voicing what a lot of people can't voice.  Because everyone, if they're fucking with a guy on your level, this shit company doing 
[03:55:00]  this, they fuck with everybody.  And they're used to no consequences.  They're used to nobody being able to talk to 2 million people and go, these people suck.  But man, when their phones start ringing, then they go, oh, there's a consequence for  shitting on people individually.  It's a really fair system.  I always do.  But that's why I get angry.  Like, I could fix my XM series problem by talking to somebody here.  They gave me one of these things today.  I'm not even going to fucking use it.  I got nothing to do with it.  What is it?  It's a year-free subscription I just ripped into pieces.  Because I shouldn't... 
[03:55:30]  It's written an envelope, and you still have to do something.  I shouldn't have that.  But I shouldn't need that in order to get good service.  They should just say, as a human being in America, I should have better service than that.  They should have just said, what's your ID number, and we'll take care of everything.  Not give you an envelope with more instructions.  No.  Why can't you go to different equinoxes?  That's going to annoy me all day.  No, that's...  I'm not...  I will have nothing to do with them anymore.  That's fucking enraging.  What a dumb company.  Because they probably have something where you pay $20 extra a month, and you could go  to more equinoxes.  But I had already been so... 
[03:56:00]  I had been fucking stolen from, which they acknowledged because they gave the money back.  Right, right.  Which means they acknowledged that that was ill-gotten goods.  What fucking pricks.  But this is how...  And I was offering them a solution that, like, go ahead and you stole the money, but...  Why not?  But that, to me, is a better way than I would ever handle it.  Of course.  Like, just to have the wherewithal to go, you know what?  Fuck it.  I will take three months.  Let me just work out.  Like, that's the most reasonable thing I can think of.  You just wanted to go to different gyms, and these cocks, they won't bend. 
[03:56:30]  They won't bend.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Well, you learn that kind of shit from directing and stuff, because you have...  You have problems they have to resolve, and sometimes people fuck you, and you have one  choice.  You could get all your anger out and be stuck with the problem.  Yeah.  Or you calmly say to somebody, this is totally counter to what I...  Like, I'm making...  I'm renovating this house, and this guy did something completely wrong, so I tell him none  of this is what I wanted, and he's...  I hear him get confrontational. 
[03:57:00]  It's what you asked for.  Hey.  I'm certain that's not what I asked for.  Yeah.  This is what I wanted.  Well, I'm not...  You know, I don't do...  I don't do that.  But...  And I said, let's just tell me how it gets fixed.  Forget who pays for it.  Just tell me what you would do now as a solution...  Right.  Yeah.  ...to fix it.  Well, I'd have to change this and that and this and that.  Okay, what else?  And then he tells me the whole thing, and I go, that sounds good.  Let's talk later about who's going to pay for it.  We don't have to talk about that now.  Let's just...  That's what we're...  Let's make that...  Let's make that happen.  You and me will have a talk about what should happen. 
[03:57:30]  And then he got off the phone, and he had a couple of days, and he called me and said,  I'll share the cost of the replacement.  You know what I mean?  Oh, look at you.  Like, when you're in a confrontation with somebody, you tell them your side of it, and then don't  try to fix it right then.  You just say, let's go off you and me, and think about it like a shrink.  Where were you when I was destroying every relationship I've ever been in?  It's fucking amazing.  But that's fucking why you get things done.  It's a fucking great way of just handling a problem and not getting even emotional. 
[03:58:00]  Well, because if you need it to get fixed right in front of you, if you need that immediate  gratification, you both have it, and your knee is going to back down.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, what the hell, Louie?  It's on a job site.  That happens all the time.  Everybody's yelling and screaming, blow the whistle.  I'm home.  Give me my lunch pail.  What the hell do I need?  Give me a container of coffee.  Once the whistle blows, we're all men again.  Yeah, we're all men again.  You buy me a Pabst, I'll buy you a Schlitz.  That's all we need.  I don't drink.  I quit in 87.  I can't improv liquor.  All right, let's get out of here. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, I got to get out of here.  Louie, it was great seeing you, buddy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fucking Lutely.  Louie C.K., my, oh my God, premieres April 13th at 10 p.m. on HBO.  We don't stay this late for nobody.  We could have hung away for 10 more minutes because my show I'm not going to do today.  Oh, fuck.  I don't care.  It's fine.  This was more fun.  I'll do it tomorrow, Friday, whatever.  Eh, whatever you want to do.  Eh, what the hell.  Talk to you, man.  You blow the whistle.  I listen.  I'll do it on Friday.  I'm not here on Friday.  Okay, I'll do it on Friday.  Oh, Sam.  Is that okay?  Sammy.  Hey, it's better for me Friday anyway.  And also a big thank you to the WWE for bringing Fandango over today. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, Friday, Eric and I will be at WrestleMania Radio Rose.  And you guys will be, like, doing some phoners and stuff or getting some guests for us?  You'll have the ability to patch in.  I think Punk's going to be there, so maybe when Punk comes on, you guys can be a campaign.  I bet they won't make it happen.  You don't think so?  Nah.  Oh, the company?  Yeah.  Something will fall through.  Well, we couldn't get transportation.  It's a jersey.  Could we get a copy of Louie bitching about the company? 
[03:59:30]  I want to send it right to Scott Creasy.  I'm not even joking.  Yeah, absolutely.  It was a lot.  I mean, when we bitch, we sound like complete lunatics.  He had logic there.  I'm going to put that on his desk.  Take care, man.  Drive safe.  All right, Louie.  We'll see you next time.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Hey, drive safe.  I want to say Caroline's April 11 through 14.  I will be there with bells on.  He just slipped right.  Joe became Jim just like that.  I'll tell you why.  I didn't know if you'd hit it without knowing.  I'll be at both hands over the button. 
[04:00:00]  So I'm like, he might not think I'm doing that.  So I wanted to Jim plug real quick.  Yeah, no, no, no.  April 11 through 14.  And then, of course, Louie, April 13th at 10 o'clock.  HBO.  Oh, my God.  Premieres on HBO.  It's fucking great, dude.  Thank you, sir.  Great posters and everything.  Thank you.  See you tomorrow, I guess.  Okay.  All right.  It's going to be okay.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[04:00:30]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Why not, right?  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  All the knobs were turned down to fix everything.  I guess people didn't think this was going to happen.  Call it.  We only got a few minutes.  866-WOW-1-WOW is a ridiculous show today.  So call up if you feel like it.  866-969-1969.  I just figured, after all the times that Ron Bennington has said that Wednesday is by 
[04:01:00]  far his favorite day for the after show, how could I possibly disappoint him on this  Wednesday, you know?  Why not give him something to listen to?  It was great to hear Louis C.K. back in here.  Louis, I don't remember when the last time he was in here.  When was the last time he was in here, Eric?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to look.  It was a while back, though.  But it's...  It's probably the boat story.  Yeah, probably.  Oh, do you have that new Roland bit?  Yeah, I do. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, let me get that CD.  I'll play that.  New Roland...  And the new Roland bit just gets forgotten because Louis C.K. is in here.  Eric, you were freaking out for Fandango.  Is that right?  Yeah, Fandango's great.  He was the man.  I knew it was coming and I was surprised.  Just how great it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  210.  Hey, Sam.  It's Lady Trucker.  Lucky me.  How's it going, Lady Trucker?  Hey, I was wondering if little Scots could sing Happy Birthday to me.  I'm not going to do the character because you asked for it. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, come on.  You did such a good job with me.  Hey, happy birthday.  That is such a great character.  You like little Scorch?  Oh, we were dying back.  Yeah, between them doing regular Scorch and you doing little Scorch.  It's all right, Scorch.  You got this.  Yeah, do good.  I haven't spoken to him.  I wonder.  I was thinking that while we were playing PFG TV today...  Does he have a Twitter, by the way?  I don't know.  I don't want to give it out.  Okay.  Because I was just thinking, he's got to hate me.  Sam, every video that he puts up, it's all shit like, Sam Roberts sent me here, Sam Roberts sent me here. 
[04:02:30]  He's got to hate me, don't you think?  You can't repair that bridge.  Yeah, it's been burned, hasn't it?  I've taken the Opie route on that one.  And I try to maintain relationships with people that I work with.  Not this one.  You didn't maintain it when you started here.  Well, I had to use it for the juice it was worth then.  You know, back then, I was just trying to squeeze whatever juice I could get out of this play.  Would you think, six years later, that you'd still be doing Scorch?  Yeah.  Actually, yes.  After playing that first Scorch bit, I was like, there's no way that this will ever get old. 
[04:03:00]  What does that say?  I hate to name drop, but Sam Roberts said, go fuck yourself, E-Rock Army nigga.  Well, I didn't say that.  It's all in good fun, Scorchy.  403, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sal is a motherfucker.  Why do you say that?  Because I've tried calling the show for like a week straight.  And every time that cocksucker sees my number, he hangs up. 
[04:03:30]  Well, do you have anything good to say?  Well, I mean, twice now they've been talking about subscription bullshit.  Yeah.  And I live in Canada, and with a serious radio, you cannot listen to you guys at all.  No matter what you do.  Right.  You have to buy an XM radio and all cars.  Yeah, but I mean, we're sitting here battling our own battles here.  And I'm talking to Louis C.K.  And the thing that ONA wants to do more than anything is talk to some fucking Canadian guy. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, hold on, Louis.  Some guy in Canada has a similar problem.  Yeah, let's stop everything that's going amazingly well.  Do you think they'll go to Scott Greenstein and be like,  Scott, did you hear on today's show?  Not only is Louis having problems, but there's a guy in Canada who's having...  Who wants to talk a boat?  You can't get serious.  Shut up.  Just fucking hang up on this guy.  Sal, you're a cocksucker.  Yeah.  You get mad at the callers.  Because I'm trying to...  Yeah, all right.  That was fantastic.  That was a little bitch.  Ouch. 
[04:04:30]  And I'm just...  You're sitting there, and ONA are talking about things.  How often do callers get mad at you?  Every day.  Do people yell at you in there?  Every day.  Like, fuck you, Sal?  Every day.  Remember how we used to comment about how Troy handled the callers?  Oh, God.  Troy was the worst phone screener.  I've seen traces of Troy in Sal now.  It's just something about that position turns you into this.  You slowly go insane.  Travis did it.  Don't nod your head, you intern.  You've been here for two weeks and a cup of coffee.  What do you mean over time? 
[04:05:00]  You don't know what...  Addresses is correct.  You don't know what happens over time.  You haven't been here for any time.  Troy, you are not a great phone screener because you do not have what they call a long fuse.  No.  You can't be a phone screener with a short fuse.  Yeah, and Sal's defense, I mean, that's an awful position.  It is a rough job, right?  You know, this intern was just sitting here saying he's been through the shit, so he knows.  Yeah, I mean, it's really an intern position, but you need somebody that certainly knows what they're doing to do the job.  It's so funny, too, because it's an important position. 
[04:05:30]  Opie and Anthony, they go like, well, why would we have an intern screening calls?  And they go, well, you only take like an average of two phone calls per day.  Yeah.  But the minute there's a bad one, that's when it counts.  Here's the thing.  You know the ONA Twitter voice?  Yeah.  Imagine now you actually have to hear the person's actual voice.  That's the dude.  The dude who's tweeting.  The assholes who fucking call him.  Is that right, Troy?  Yeah.  And I love Opie, but the days that he would be out and it would just be Anne, I'd be excited about it.  Oh, my God.  Because I'd know that there would be no phone calls, so I didn't really have to work too hard on it. 
[04:06:00]  How long did you have to screen calls for?  Two, three years.  That long you were screening calls here?  Yeah.  Like every day?  Probably about two years, two and a half years.  Wow.  Yeah, because I know Travis was definitely our longest phone screener.  I think he did it for like four years straight.  Yeah.  And that was his shit.  Um, and he did a good job, but I think it's also because Travis, Travis is a more, uh, intellectually minded person.  Like he can kind of.  Thank you, Sam.  You're saying Star Wars is more intellectual than you are. 
[04:06:30]  I think he's a little calmer.  Yeah, definitely.  I would definitely say that.  He's definitely a little calmer than I am.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean.  But I mean, honestly though, Sal's got to just suck it up because I have no sympathy on.  You don't?  No.  Not until he puts in that two years.  Well, he's got to put in his work.  Right.  I don't, I don't, I don't care that I screen calls, but just the people, I'm trying to provide O&A with the best calls.  If some guy's calling in about fucking nonsense.  Yeah.  Or some guy's calling in asking about, you know, is this the correct line to call for an XM subscription?  It's like, get your fucking head straight. 
[04:07:00]  There's no radio show.  What about when intern Alan Thicke Jr. is going like, yeah, dude, I, I'm with you.  It's too, are you sitting here looking at him like, I mean, get the fuck out of here.  He has a problem sometimes with breakfast orders.  All right.  So he's got a whole.  Oh my God.  If he doesn't write something down, it's.  Oh, completely.  In one ear, completely out the other.  You don't have good memory retention, Alan?  I'm, I'm really like in the moment.  Do you remember how I worded the question I just asked you?  Uh, no, I don't.  Okay.  I see what you guys are saying.  I see what you guys are saying.  All right.  Uh, five, seven, one real quick. 
[04:07:30]  All right.  Not quick enough.  Two, oh, four.  No, you're echoing.  Eight, one, five.  Yeah.  How you doing guys?  Good.  Love the show.  Love the actor show.  Thanks.  So real quick, the guy's Canada.  I'm not, I'm serious with you guys.  I'm not interested.  We've moved on.  Seven, one, five.  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know that I think you're all doing a fantastic job.  And thanks for the minutes of entertainment.  Well, there you go.  I think that's a great place to end the show. 
[04:08:00]  Alan Thicke Jr., I was going to go to your bit today.  Sam, we do this every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  It's not going to happen today.  It's not going to happen ever.  I had Michael Cole on Tuesday.  I had Michelle Beadle on Monday.  And tomorrow you have a big guest.  I got a big guest tomorrow.  He's your Matt.  Sam, he's your Matt Damon.  We'll try sneaking in tomorrow.  But I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  Alan Thicke Jr.'s bit tomorrow on the after show.  Maybe Friday.  I'm just kidding.  That'll be Jim's advice show.  Ron and Fez are next. 
[04:08:30]  You all are doing great.  Goodbye, everybody.  Hopey and Anthony show is now over.  For real this I'm over. 
[04:09:00]  For real this I'm over. </pre>
