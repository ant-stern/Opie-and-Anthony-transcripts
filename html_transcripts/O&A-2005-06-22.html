<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts engaging in their characteristically aggressive and insulting banter.  The conversation quickly shifted to a discussion of a recently convicted individual involved in a 1960s racial crime, focusing on his appearance and security.  They then moved to a highway accident involving a mulch truck, detailing the resulting traffic jam and damage. A caller, Bruce from Pennsylvania, described the extent of the traffic disruption firsthand.  This transitioned into a discussion about a maid who stole jewelry from celebrities, including Robert De Niro, prompting reflection on the risks of employing domestic help.

Opie then detailed his minimalist apartment and sleeping habits, including his reliance on rain CDs and complete darkness. This led to humorous anecdotes about his noisy upstairs neighbors, their cat, and Opie's experience signing for their numerous packages.  He recounted befriending an eccentric woman in his building who read the New York Times by tearing and marking up the pages, only to later discover she was a speed reader and anti-death penalty activist.  The death penalty was briefly debated, followed by a detailed description of Opie's rain CDs and their sound effects, and a return to the discussion of the eccentric woman.  The segment concluded with the disastrous attempt to create the world's largest Snapple popsicle in Union Square, its sticky aftermath, and traffic disruption.  This was followed by a barrage of listener calls and jokes focusing on the size of Ben's penis. The hosts also discussed rent control in New York City, illustrating the disparity between rent-controlled and market-rate apartments using listener calls from across the country.  The popsicle incident was revisited before moving on.


The show continued with a sustained, recurring joke about the size of Ben's penis, employing outlandish hyperbole.  They discussed a protest outside CBS FM radio station following its format change from oldies to Jack FM, playing audio clips from the protest.  The hosts found amusement in the protestors' unawareness of station owner Joe Hollander's presence at the rally.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the "Ben's hog" jokes, interspersed with listener opinions on the format change and speculation about the protestors.  A news story about premature ejaculation was briefly discussed.  The segment concluded with more "Ben's hog" jokes and a quick rundown of the American Film Institute's top 100 movie quotes.


The next segment began with a discussion of the AFI's top 12 movie quotes, many profane and racially charged, particularly from *Blazing Saddles*.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a sex toy, "The Liberator," that had been sent to the studio, with detailed and humorous descriptions of the sexual positions depicted in its instructions.  Caller Sally briefly participated in the movie quote discussion.  The countdown of movie quotes continued, punctuated by jokes and tangents.  Caller Les from Alabama provided humorous commentary.  Speculation about Natalie Holloway's disappearance was briefly touched upon. Further listener calls offered opinions (often incorrect) on the movie quotes.  The segment continued with a discussion of an interview with "the runaway bride," Jennifer Wilbanks, playing clips that highlighted her claims and the perceived lack of in-depth questioning by the interviewer.  The hosts criticized both the interview and Wilbanks' story.  This transitioned into several listener calls detailing shoplifting and other criminal activities, leading to a debate about the motivations behind shoplifting. A caller, Kyle, described committing a drive-by shooting.  The segment concluded with more discussion about the runaway bride interview and the hosts' opinions, along with further listener calls about shoplifting and other criminal actions. Jimmy Norton's appearance on the Tonight Show and the concept of "selling out" were also discussed.


The final segment focused on Jennifer Wilbanks and the bank embezzlement story.  The discussion of Wilbanks centered on highly critical and vulgar commentary about her actions and the Katie Couric interview, particularly focusing on her fabricated rape claim.  Couric's interviewing style was criticized as ineffective and overly soft.  The bank embezzlement story led to a lengthy conversation about the caller's methods, the details of the crime, and the plausibility of his claims, with other callers, especially truckers, challenging the story's veracity.  The conversation devolved into jokes and tangents.  Numerous callers shared their opinions, anecdotes (including stealing a beer truck and shoplifting), and engaged in further sexually explicit and offensive jokes.  No guests were identified beyond the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut your fucking mouth, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole.  Oh, are you about to call me an asshole?  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:00:30]  Do you think I'm cute, Private Pile?  Do you think I'm funny?  Dad!  What is that, Private Pile?  Sir, shall we do it, sir?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! 
[00:01:00]  And we're off!  And we're off!  Bam, bam!  Bam, bam, bam!  Bam, bam, bam!  Eh, eh, eh!  Bam, bam, bam!  Eh, eh, eh!  Look at his old codger.  Jesus.  Ah.  Yelling and screaming and knocking the microphones out of his face.  Oh, is he yelling? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, he was all miserable.  The guy that got, uh, finally got convicted for that, um, racial crime.  Back in the 60s, was it?  Yeah, I think so.  64 it was.  Philadelphia, Mississippi.  Ooh, yeah.  That's, uh, boy, that guy is on the oxygen.  They wheel him in.  They don't care about time passing by.  It's not like, ah, well, enough time's passed by.  Perhaps his ideas have changed.  Nah, he looks like he's... 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, string him up.  He's still, uh...  Looks like he's still a hoot.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like he's still a feisty old codger.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Yeah.  And he has these huge black policemen protecting him.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, I'm sure a lot of the black cops kind of wanted that detail, you know?  Like, let me, you know, I want to be walking next to this guy when, uh, when they roll him into court, you know?  I think it's like an empowerment thing.  He's there in the wheelchair rolling in to be convicted. 
[00:02:30]  Uh, cop.  Black guy cop, you know?  I'm sure the guy in the wheelchair there never, never imagined that would happen.  A mongrel class of people.  And ask him if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is, they want to throw white children and colored children into the building part of integration.  Through out of which will come a conglomerated, the latter, mongrel class of people. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, exactly.  All of greatness will be destroyed and miserable.  I, for one, after God will die before I yield one end.  Oh, there you go.  Here, here, here, here, here.  Among?  All right, well, that video's all over the TV today.  And then, uh, the crash of the morning.  God, we love this in New York City, and I'm sure you have one in your fine town, wherever the hell you're listening. 
[00:03:30]  This is a bad one, though.  This was a horrendous one in, um, what was it, Jersey, I guess?  Yeah, I think so.  Every morning, we go into the office for the new listeners, and we watch the local news, get the show ready, whatever.  We're shooting the shit and stuff.  And every morning, they have the crash of the morning, we call it.  Yep.  Obviously, in the middle of the night, there's some shit going on on the highways, man.  And then they kind of do a good job of clearing it off before it really gets into the rush hour.  Yeah, we lost one of our fellow truckers, because I guess there's a fatality and everything. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Basically, the guy was carrying what?  Mulch.  Mulch, who is that?  Carrying a little bit of mulch.  Some kind of soil product.  Yep.  Some kind of dirt product.  Dirt.  And all of a sudden, he just veered off the road and just took out lots and lots of trees.  Yeah, he took out, man, it looked like a quarter mile of trees this guy just took out.  Kind of veered off the road.  It pummeled the cab of the truck.  Just shredded it.  And then the dirt spilt all over the road. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, the whole truck was sideways.  It's dead.  They got some kind of a loader out there trying to get the dirt up.  Pretty nasty crash.  It's only a five-mile backup right now, so.  Oh, that's it?  That's it.  That's an easy one for the New York area.  You know, these truckers, especially when they're hauling dirt and stuff like that, you've got to cover up those goddamn loads.  I've been behind a few trucks on the expressway, and the wind blows right off the top of the pile of dirt.  You see the pile of dirt in the back of the truck. 
[00:05:00]  Blows off the top.  And there's rocks and everything just pelting your vehicle.  Bastards.  And then you've got to do like 85 to pass the truck.  That's my excuse now if I get pulled over on the expressway by a cop, by the way.  It's officer.  I was being pelted by that truck.  But you have a badge.  You don't have to give any excuses.  I do not have a badge.  I do not have a badge.  The NYPD gave you a badge, a uniform, a cute little hat.  I am an honorary officer, but I don't use my credentials and uniform and car that I have parked in my garage. 
[00:05:30]  A police cruiser.  I got a lousy PVA card once, and Anthony's got this placard that's displayed proudly on his car.  They give me a taser.  I just tase people for the hell that I go out in my cop uniform tasing people.  It's fun.  Bruce in Pennsylvania.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, I'm heading the other way from that accident.  Yeah.  And by the way, Anthony, I hope you have your uniform hanging up next to your cape and stuff. 
[00:06:00]  My wizard robe.  Your wizard robe.  Your wizard robe.  There you go.  I'm surprised that a listener hasn't sent in a wizard robe yet.  Go ahead, Bruce.  I run a truck terminal in North Jersey.  I see about 1,000 of these savages a day.  Now, one of them has gone ahead and ruined my commute for the day, as well as these thousands  of other assholes who've got to look at the sign here or look at the accident.  It's horrible.  I think you wanted to say simply that the backup is 20 miles and not five. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, it's 20 miles.  Yeah, I've been going 40 miles an hour since 6 o'clock this morning.  Fucking bastards.  Wow.  Anyway, punch it out, fellas.  Have a great day.  That's a rough one.  All right.  That was a rough call to start the morning.  That was the first one right there, Anthony.  I'm sorry for that.  Yeah.  All right.  So the KKK killer was convicted.  De Niro's nanny stole a $100,000 pair of earrings, I guess. 
[00:07:00]  It's a maid.  Yeah.  Oh, because they say De Niro.  Nanny.  Yeah.  Yeah, here it says, maid, maid off with wife's $95,000 diamond earrings.  De Niro's wife's earrings were stolen.  And then there were other things that were ripped off from other celebrities.  What was she like, a frigging housekeeper to the celebrities?  Then she went in there and stole a bunch of stuff.  35-year-old Lucina Turek Wawrynauzic. 
[00:07:30]  The hell's her name?  Are you speaking backwards?  She's a tall, blonde, Polish immigrant.  Oh, boy.  She's from Queens, where the cops said they found more loot.  Sources said the sticky-fingered maid stole jewelry, credit cards, and clothing from her clients,  including Candace Bergen, after being sent to their swank Manhattan apartments by a housekeeping agency. 
[00:08:00]  Hmm.  That's probably bad for the agency.  I would say so.  They found a $1,000 suede coat, two expensive cameras belonging to Bergen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's something you've got to watch out for.  What do you do, Opie?  Do you watch your maid doing her work, or do you let her just have run of the house?  I've got a Polish maid, and she has a key to my apartment. 
[00:08:30]  Really?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  She'd get her hands on the Hughes fortune in there.  Obviously, she can't steal furniture.  There's just plenty of stuff to steal in my joint.  Yeah.  She can't steal food.  I'm trying to think what she could possibly steal.  Police said they apprehended her with a carload of java logs.  They recognized the coffee scent coming out of her trunk and pulled her over. 
[00:09:00]  I had to go through that in my mind.  Do I give her a key to make it so much easier?  Yeah.  And then I'm like, who am I kidding?  I have nothing.  You have nothing in there.  That's a pretty stark apartment.  I am a minimalist when it comes to my apartment.  That's what I like to call it.  Do you leave money laying around ever?  Yeah.  There's probably a five spot.  A fiver.  Wow.  There you go.  And a little tray of quarters for the meters.  Yeah.  Oh, quarters for the meters.  Well, she could dig into that.  She could get maybe $10 worth of quarters.  Wow.  Sure. 
[00:09:30]  Skip town after taking that kind of money.  Man, I should contact MTV Cribs.  It would be a whole different story.  It's just nothing.  No.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What?  I just make sure my bed's nice and comfortable.  I got a nice TV.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You don't have a headboard, though, right?  No.  No headboard on your bed.  No.  You just bought a dresser.  Yeah.  So that's pretty much your furniture.  No, the clothes really aren't in the dresser.  You haven't put your clothes in the dresser.  No, they're kind of on top of it, though. 
[00:10:00]  You put the clothes on top of your dresser.  Yeah.  And what about any other furniture?  Did you buy anything for your living room area where you got your big screen television?  Yeah, I got a nice glass coffee table now.  Oh, you got the glass coffee table.  Or like, I don't know, end tables, I guess you would call them.  Oh, it's not a coffee table in front of the...  No, no, no, no.  A little end table.  A little end table to put my little drink on.  Any type of dining area?  No.  No, stop.  Well, I eat outside, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a little outside. 
[00:10:30]  I know, I've seen the outside, sure.  I like eating out there.  Mm-hmm.  No other bedroom, though?  I think end tables for your bed.  What do you put...  No.  What do you put your, like, nighttime, bedtime stuff?  Like your water?  Do you have water at night that you...  Yeah, on the floor.  ...keep up there?  On the floor?  Yeah.  On the floor.  Which is easily four feet down.  Oh, you got the big, thick mattress.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, I know.  You got to have those.  It's ridiculous.  So, I...  Yeah.  No.  But, you know, what if you're...  I don't know.  They just always seem to need things. 
[00:11:00]  Tissues.  You have tissues by the bed?  Oh, man, when I go to bed, I go to bed.  Yeah, I brush my teeth.  Sometimes I'm talking about other things.  Clean my face maybe a little bit.  Yeah.  And then I crash, and that's it.  Yeah.  I don't wake up in the middle of the night to get my little tissues and, ooh, I got to  get a sip of water.  Did you...  You never woke up in the middle of the night with your nose going like...  And just, it's keeping you awake. 
[00:11:30]  You got to launch that rocket.  Because you have a bat in the bat cave?  Yeah.  There's a boulder up there that is cleverly disguised as a little kid's whistle.  I'm trying to sleep.  It's like...  Whistle.  Whistle.  Whistle.  Whistle.  Whistle.  Gotta go to sleep.  My nose.  Whistle.  Whistle.  Whistle.  No.  Oh, maybe this will help. 
[00:12:00]  Whistle.  Whistle.  No?  I don't need any tissues in the middle of the night.  That's snack time when that happens.  Oh, God.  Snack.  A little midnight snack.  Ooh.  What a gift.  And he looks like he has plenty of midnight snacks.  No, I set my little alarm.  Yeah.  Where do you put your alarm?  It's kind of on the floor.  On the floor.  Jesus Christ.  It's kind of on like this futon sort of on the side.  Like it's just...  Oh, my God.  Really nilly.  It looks like a flophouse. 
[00:12:30]  No.  It's got to look like a flophouse with stuff on the floor.  The alarm clock on the floor just reeks of flophouse.  Yeah, people would be surprised.  Definitely.  No, I mean, it's...  I got nice stuff and stuff.  I just...  I don't know.  I'm not a...  Yeah.  Whatever.  I don't like being in my apartment.  I like to be out and about.  Well, you've got to spend time in your bedroom, at least.  I have a rain CD.  It's raining every night in my bedroom.  Do you put on a CD of rain? 
[00:13:00]  Thunderstorms.  It's raining out again.  I'm fooling myself.  I got to sleep.  Is that because of the noise issue?  You just don't want to hear anything?  Well, no.  I moved my whole bedroom downstairs in the basement because the stupid people upstairs with their cats.  I finally gave up.  I lost that battle.  Cats making too much noise?  That's been...  That was an ongoing battle for about six months.  Cats.  They got lions up there?  What kind of noise?  How long have we been back?  Nine months?  Ten months now? 
[00:13:30]  It's been a battle nine or ten months.  They don't have a rug down upstairs and they love their fucking cat.  Yeah.  And they roll some stupid ball or something and the ball goes all the way across their apartment.  So I hear it in my ceiling.  I hate apartments.  And, you know, unfortunately we have to go to bed relatively early.  So to me, like 9, 30, 10 o'clock is really fucking late.  That might as well be three in the morning for us.  You know that.  Yep.  You're the same way.  But to them, they don't understand.  They probably just got home from work at seven.  To them, it's like, God, they got at least two or three more hours. 
[00:14:00]  Still daytime.  And then they like, I don't know what it is, but they walk back and forth from one end  of the apartment to the other.  Oh, those bastards are walking in their apartment.  No, but it's weird.  Like, they're like putting clothes away all night long and rolling this vault for the stupid  cat.  I got to know the ups guy that comes to the building with the packages.  Yeah.  Because I have to sign for all their shit upstairs.  Why?  And it's always more stuff for the fucking cat.  I would never do that.  So, finally...  You're responsible now.  I understand. 
[00:14:30]  Something happened.  I understand.  And that package goes missing.  I'm doing the guy a favor.  You see...  No favors.  The guy seems pretty cool.  And it's at least one person in my neighborhood I could talk to.  Oh, really?  Oh, you try to start a conversation with anyone up on the Upper West Side?  Oh, what do you want?  Jesus.  What the fuck?  What do you want to talk to people for?  Not talk, but you...  Are you insane?  Not talk, but you don't want to go through life making believe you're the only person  walking the streets when there's thousands of them around you.  After a while, you see the same people.  You want to give a little nod or something. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  You know?  I did make...  I did make...  These people.  I did make friends with a crazy lady, though.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I made friends with the crazy lady, so that's good.  What, like a homeless or one of those crazy rich ladies?  She might be on the show soon, actually.  She used to be like a prosecuting attorney back in the day, like in the early 70s.  Unless she's...  Unless this is part of the gag.  Part of she's insane?  I don't know.  But I like to go to like the Starbucks in the morning and... 
[00:15:30]  What are you, a movie or something?  What?  You go talking to old people, find out their story.  Dude, this is my thing.  Get there again.  I should have been a sociologist.  I like to observe people.  What?  Sociologist?  No?  No, a sociologist is fine.  Is that bad?  No, I wouldn't...  Your eyes got really big.  Why?  If you want to be a sociologist, I think that's perfectly acceptable.  I don't know if it's the right job for you.  Why?  Like, why?  What did I do wrong?  Actually, nothing.  You're just surprised I said that?  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Why?  I don't know.  Because I've always butchered it and said sociologist, but...  What did I say?  Sociologist.  And what did you say?  Sociologist.  What's the difference?  Well, that's very close.  Soci.  Sociologist.  Yeah.  That's so...  Hey, I'm not trying to be silly.  I mean, I'm just...  Holy crap, you're going to abuse me on that?  No, I'm not abusing you.  That is slight.  I'm not abusing you.  You fuckfash.  Oh, my God, I butcher a lot worse than that.  This is sociopathic. 
[00:16:30]  That wasn't butchering.  That was trimming a little fat.  I don't even use it, but...  Wrapping it up in wax paper.  I should have been one of those people that likes to observe the society and the people that  make it up.  There you go.  Anyway, the ups guy, really fast.  He's on to the gag with the people upstairs with the cat stuff.  I had a sign for this package.  I can't even imagine what it would be.  It's huge for the...  And I even said to the guy, more crap for their fucking cat.  And he starts laughing because he knows, too. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  He's always making deliveries for this stupid cat upstairs.  Cat.  Yeah, it's catnip.  That's what it is.  I'm selling it on the streets, but it's catnip.  Don't worry about it.  Do you know if there was like a kilo of coke in that thing, and you signed for it, and  the cops find out where it came from, and they see where it was delivered and who signed  for it, middle of the night, your door's getting kicked in, you're being arrested.  All right.  I'm not signing for packages anymore.  Don't sign for anything.  Listen to your paranoid pal, Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you are paranoid.  I would never, ever do.  I look 20 layers deep into any simple little action I might take or make or interaction  with people 20 layers deep to see how it might affect me.  Me, me, me.  And I say, nope, no favors for anyone.  I could be held liable.  So, just to finish really fast, I had to move the bedroom way down the basement so they  don't bother me with their stupid wood floor.  Yeah.  And then I turn on my little rain CD, and I'm off to the sleepy.  And no light in there or anything? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, completely dark.  Wow, that's pretty good if you're going to sleep early.  I have to, no, it has to be a cave.  It has to be pitch dark.  Absolutely no noise except for my stupid rain CD.  And the rain has fallen.  Oh, it's raining every night.  Do you have other settings?  What do you mean?  Is it one of those machines or is it a CD?  CDs.  I got sleep CDs with little piano music.  Little tiny little piano music.  Does the rain change to drizzle or is it just constantly?  You got to find the right rain CD because there's some out there that all of a sudden 
[00:18:30]  I'm...  You don't want that.  Huge thunderclaps and that wakes you up in the middle of the night.  Like, what the fuck was that?  Yeah, you don't want that.  So you got to get one that's kind of, you know, even throughout the whole thing with  little subtle thunder in the distance.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't have any of those.  I go to sleep with the TV on.  No, I can't do that.  And a big...  I have an air purifier in my bedroom that goes all night long.  It's that humming sound. 
[00:19:00]  Purifies the air, though, because you need to breathe pure air.  I understand that for me.  You freak.  But it makes hearing the TV hard sometimes.  You got to turn it up.  So anyway, just really fast.  A crazy lady I befriended.  So I would go to Starbucks on Sunday mornings and read the papers, whatever.  And I noticed this lady.  She's almost like one of these bird ladies, you know.  That's a pretty good visual for people.  And she would sit there with this huge piece of cardboard that has to be three feet. 
[00:19:30]  Is that about three feet?  Yeah, about.  Three feet by two and a half feet, two feet.  I was going to say two and a half feet just by how you had your hands spread apart.  So a nice big piece of cardboard.  And what she does, she has a black marker.  And she reads it.  Oh, and a party rock?  Oh, and a party rock.  Did she draw that on it and hold it up behind the news people?  No, no, no.  I thought she was doing assaults on the media.  No, it's the weirdest thing.  She sits there and reads the New York Times.  Mm-hmm.  But she takes, she opens up the New York Times and she tears each page. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Like, I mean, here's the New York Times, right?  Yeah.  Might as well rip it up.  No one uses it for anything else in here.  Just explain.  The New York Times, for the people in the rest of the country, it's one of these large newspapers.  The giant newspapers.  That are really a pain in the ass to read.  Old people know how to fold in a certain way.  So she flips it open like this, tears all the way down, and then places it on her cardboard,  and then has to cross out every article as she reads it.  All right.  She's completely insane. 
[00:20:30]  Every single article.  And I would like, I would search her out when I go to Starbucks because I'm just bored,  and I would kind of look over her shoulder, and she would cross things out in certain ways.  Sometimes it would be a zigzag pattern.  Sometimes it's just a line all the way down the article.  And there's probably a method to her madness in her head.  A couple of circles, whatever.  Sometimes she goes back and she's not happy with the zigzag, so she'll do a zigzag,  and then a line all the way down the column of the article.  What a lunatic.  And she does it for the entire Sunday New York Times. 
[00:21:00]  For the people around the country, our Sunday New York Times has to weigh five pounds minimum.  The thing is so fucking thick.  That must be a real treat for everybody else in there that just wants some quiet time to hear  ripping every two seconds, these old, bitty, ripping newspapers.  Right.  Yeah.  So then I've been watching her do this off and on for months,  and I happened to be sitting next to her about a week ago at another joint up on the Upper West Side. 
[00:21:30]  You're following her?  No, no.  She just happened to be sitting there, and she started up a little conversation.  She just said hi, and I'm like, oh, my God, it's a crazy lady.  I was like, ugh.  And she started her process of reading the Times.  This was during the week.  So I guess she does it to every New York Times.  Opian mod.  Right.  Ripping and then using the marker to...  I always rip up the newspapers.  You've got to mark what you've read.  So to me, I'm thinking that she's not reading at all, and she's a kook, and she's just... 
[00:22:00]  This is her way of getting through her day with her OCD, whatever, you know?  Because then she neatly piles it at every page that she rips out and completes with her markings, okay?  Right.  So I'm on the phone with Lindsay, and all of a sudden I go, oh, my God, the crazy lady's here.  And I'm like, I'm sitting right next to her as she's going through this whole process, right?  So I hang up the phone, and the only reason I said that because I was literally a foot away from her  was because she had, like, her headphones on, like her iPod cords or whatever. 
[00:22:30]  She's got an iPod?  I think so, yeah.  I think it was an iPod, yeah, because it's white.  And I turn after I said all this, like, the crazy lady's next to me, blah, blah, blah,  and I turn to see that she didn't have the iPod in her ear anymore, so she heard everything I said.  I'm like, oh, shit.  So then I hung up the phone, and she turns to me.  She goes, just in case you're wondering, I'm a speed reader.  Oh, really?  She said that because now you've said she's crazy.  And then we had a little conversation. 
[00:23:00]  She's an old speed reader.  Old prosecuting attorney or whatever, prosecutor, and now she's all about the death penalty.  She wants to spend the rest of her life educating black people about the death penalty.  Wait.  Well, is she against it or for it?  Against it, of course.  Yeah.  And I had to bite my lip at that point because I'm like, man, I want to make a friend,  so I don't want to, like, go down that road yet.  Want to make a friend?  Well, yeah, because she seems pretty interesting. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know.  Some dude, I guess, was executed in Connecticut recently.  Yeah.  If he wasn't, then I know she's crazy, but supposedly she was, you know, conversing with the guy and this and that,  and now she wants to spend her life just speaking at schools and stuff about the death penalty.  What is there to say about it?  If you get it, that's it.  Yeah.  What's there to say?  What is she educating people on?  I don't know.  She thinks, she's amazed that black people and minorities have no clue what the death penalty is about.  They have no idea. 
[00:24:00]  And that might prevent them from doing what they do.  When they strap them on the Gourney.  But then I was going to argue with her, like, you know, she's all concerned about the death penalty in New York,  and we've had that since when, Ant?  1990-something, right?  At least.  Pataki got in.  At least 10 years, right?  Yeah.  And we haven't fried anyone?  No, I haven't used it.  Well, they don't even fry people anymore.  Ah, you strap them in, shoot them up, and they fall asleep.  Yeah, they took the fun out of it.  Yeah.  If you're going to execute, you've got to execute.  Call the entertainment value out.  Hey.  Occasionally, you get the flaming head.  Right.  The little lightning bolt shooting out of the ankle. 
[00:24:30]  Something like that.  Now they just put you to sleep.  Yeah, now they just, yeah.  They put a rain CD on.  Rain CD and air purifier.  And then they just inject you.  See how we bring it all around, people?  Sleepy time.  Oh, is it like this?  Oh, he's getting, look, he's yawning.  He's getting all sleepy.  Oh, wow, nice.  This is just like taking value.  That is good.  Yeah.  Is this what, like, you listen to it?  Like this? 
[00:25:00]  It's kind of rain on a roof.  Nah.  No?  It's not visual enough.  Mine is all about...  It's like a rain forest type rain?  Ah, dude, my, it's a cabin in the woods.  Yeah, this is like hitting a tin roof or something.  This stinks.  This is a, this is a rainstorm in Queens.  In the project.  Yeah, let me tell you what my rain CD's all about.  Mine is, I got the visual.  All right.  I got a nice little, little spread in the, in the mountains.  There's a cabin.  A cabin?  And it's right on a, like a lake, a small lake, maybe a big pond, okay? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And there's a little stream that goes right by the house.  Ooh.  So that's part of the, yeah, exactly.  So you get the noises of nature and a little water going by.  And then you hear in the background, yeah, this is perfect.  And here comes a thunderstorm across the lake, across the pond.  The pond, you're in like Africa.  No, I'm not.  This is like, I'm up in like, uh, the Catskills.  The Catskills? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Listen to the, you're under the canopy of a rainforest.  Oh, yeah, I do have a rainforest rain CD too, you're right.  That's what this is.  What, they don't have noises like this?  I'm hearing a toucan.  They don't have noises like this in the...  They're not native to the Catskills.  They don't have noises like this in the Catskills?  I don't think so.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  That is relaxing.  That's a great way to go to sleep, I'm telling you.  And then when your mind slowly starts shutting down for the night, it gets very visual in my bedroom. 
[00:26:30]  It probably helps a lot more than, uh, than watching Discovery Channel's airline disasters  to go to sleep.  And then just as a goof sometimes, I get my apartment really, really dark and really quiet.  Ooh.  And then I...  Do you spray water up on yourself?  A little spray bottle?  A little spray bottle?  A little spray bottle?  A little spray bottle?  A little spray bottle?  A little spray bottle?  Like you're out in the rain?  And then I put on, uh, the opening sequence to The Shining.  Ooh.  And just see if I can handle that, and how long I can handle that before I completely 
[00:27:00]  freak out.  That's scary.  Yeah, let's...  What is that?  Huh?  I hear like...  There's elephants!  Oh, B!  Are there elephants?  Oh, they're going by, you know.  Yeah.  That's a peaceful place I live.  That's a nice cabin.  I live with nature, and everyone's just happy.  You see elephants in the Catskills.  Yeah.  All right, I think that's a T-Rex.  Anyway.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, you want to see how brave you are, though?  Put on the, uh, the Shining music as you're going to bed.  Nah, that's scary.  Get the house completely fucking dark.  Completely.  Try to fall asleep as this is playing in the background.  See how long you'll last before you're completely freaked out and have to turn on every light  in the house.  Yeah, it's creepy.  Nah, I wouldn't be able to do it.  I'm seeing the twins in my head, and it's freaking me out, and it's daytime. 
[00:28:00]  I can barely hear this during the day.  Imagine the middle of the night.  Just as a goof, you put this on as you're sleeping.  I can't take the scary commercials that are on now for movies, because, like I said, I  fall asleep with the TV on, and a lot of times they'll come on, and they're pretty creepy.  Some of the trailers.  Yeah.  Little scary things in the corner.  They jump out of nowhere.  They got the little kid voice, like,  It scares the shit out of me. 
[00:28:30]  I really got to start helping XM program their channels.  If you got a channel like Audio Visions, you don't need a jock going, Audio Visions.  Right, right, right.  Because it's all that background music that is supposed to be background music.  It's like Yanni, Kitaro.  Just let it play.  What have you.  Very, like, trippy, mellow music, you know?  Mm-hmm.  But all of a sudden, they have to identify the channel, even though you know in your display.  Audio Visions.  Right.  So you're in the middle of a nap or something listening to this in the background, and all 
[00:29:00]  of a sudden, they pipe in.  There's been a couple times I forget to put the timer on.  Yeah.  And I wake up the birds chirping.  But they got some kind of thing going with birds, all different kinds of birds, and a  little bit of music in the background.  They'll play birds chirping on...  Oh, yeah.  Maybe XM has too many channels.  No, this is...  I'm starting to think maybe there's too many channels.  Actually, when I go off and do some of that reading, I bring my Fi, and I throw the Audio 
[00:29:30]  Visions in the background so I don't have to hear the people around me yapping about their  stupid lives.  Really?  They mean absolutely nothing to anyone except themselves.  And there's just birds and music and nice sounds.  Yeah, lightly in my ears instead of some lady talking about how her kid is the best and  all that.  Ugh.  How about that?  And then I do fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning and Audio Visions, yes.  Those two are...  I listen to that one once in a while, too.  Those two are great.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Puts it out, guys.  Bye.  Was Ant 20 layers deep into St. Pat's thing? 
[00:30:00]  What does that mean?  Ah, I didn't foresee that.  I didn't look at that situation, get layers deep to see how the repercussions would affect  me.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  But, you know...  All right.  ...you screw up every so often, my friend.  Mm-hmm.  It's very hard to look at everything like that.  And who knew that, you know, having a stand-in, taking that couple to St. Pat's was going  to be a problem.  Wouldn't happen again, though.  I look deep.  You do look deep.  That's right.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  Why don't we take a quick break?  We'll regroup.  We've got to talk about the Snapple meltdown in Union Square.  They're calling it Goonin Square.  What?  Instead of...  That's a stretch.  Union Square.  Instead of Union Square.  Union Square.  That's almost impossible to say.  Goon.  Goon.  I know.  Take it away, Jimmy.  I didn't say goon, did I?  I said goon.  No, no, no.  Not you.  All right.  You're scaring me again. 
[00:31:00]  There's other letters you might want to put in that little...  Yeah.  For different stories that might pop up.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  I know.  I was trying to come up with a good situation.  What are they talking about?  I don't see any little animals with dark circles on their eyes.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  You know what?  When we get back, we've got to talk about the missing scout that they found there in New York.  Look at that.  It's a miracle, Opie.  Well, we've got to play the clip of the mom.  Very happy for the family, but stop. 
[00:31:30]  Of course.  The little boy is back safe and sound.  You'll understand after you hear the clip of the mother and what we're getting at.  Another woman who's only thinking of herself and maybe not thinking of other people.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No share.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  The hot piece of ass.  What a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Opium Antony Show. 
[00:32:00]  In case you didn't know.  Ah, you're checking out the Opium Antony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, it is.  It's wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  If you don't have a wow sticker yet, very simple.  Just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we send out the wow stickers immediately.  I don't have the address in front of us, but you can go to opiumantony.com and the address  is there somewhere, all right?  Right.  Very simple.  You throw the wow in your car.  If the ladies feel like it, they will flash you as you're driving around.  It's been working like a charm for many, many years. 
[00:33:00]  All right, where do you want to go next, Anthony?  I was just thinking during the break about that old lady that was on TV about her stupid  apartment today as well.  Oh, yeah.  Well, in New York you have a rent control, it's called.  Every year or so they have these hearings and decide, because the landlords always want  to raise the rent, and the people that live in these rent-controlled apartments want it  to stay the same.  How did that all start, the rent control?  I have no idea.  Does anyone know?  I have no idea, but it turns out these people are living in what amounts to $4,000 or $5,000 
[00:33:30]  a month apartments for about $500 a month.  Yeah, they were showing this old lady, and it's always old people, so it's something that  happened, I don't know, many, many years ago.  Yeah.  Because, you know, a young person like ourselves here, we're not fortunate enough to get into  these situations.  Oh, rent control.  It's all old people, so something happened way back when.  Yeah, I don't know how it happened. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know how that happened.  If you're a building owner, you're the landlord, and you can't charge what is a fair price for  an apartment because of a law that says you can't, and these, so this woman is on the  news, and apparently they gave the landlords like this little piddly 2% raise or something  like that that they were able to get from the tenants, it amounted, this woman's paying  like $540 a month for rent for a three-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. 
[00:34:30]  Who knows, forever.  It has to be 30 years, 50 years.  Yeah, 40 years.  And she was livid, she said, because they had raised her rent $15 a month.  $15 a month raised the rent.  And she's livid, she's living in a, what amounts to $5,000 a month it would cost.  It's a palace.  To live there.  It's a palace.  Yeah.  You get a shoebox in New York City, it's going to cost you a lot more than that. 
[00:35:00]  You don't even get that for $500 in New York.  You get a shoebox with roommates in most of the city for that price.  I don't know how that happened.  How do you then tell a guy that owns the building, you're the owner, you want to charge  something, why can't people go around to stores or something and just say, hey, you can't  charge that.  It's got to be this price.  Same thing.  Well, don't they, after the person dies and you can raise the rent of the apartment or  if they get rid of it, like it's only that person, I think. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I've heard it could be passed on, though.  Oh, really?  I don't know about it.  I've seen where, yeah, when the person finally moves on, then they could, you know, charge  whatever the hell they want.  It's hard to say, like, I understand that you should be able to charge whatever you want  if you own the building, but then again, if there wasn't any kind of rent control, a  lot of people would just be in deep shit.  No, you know what?  A little bit of New York 30 years.  A lot of people would be probably moving somewhere else that they could afford.  Well, the point I'm getting at is I think the old lady should shut the fuck up.  Right.  She's not getting any sympathy from anyone watching the TV this morning. 
[00:36:00]  Count her blessings, I like to say.  Good point, boys.  Good point.  Her rent was raised $15.  $15.  After who knows how long.  You know, they're always coming up with these things, and who knows how long a rent has  been what it is.  Right.  And then it's raised $15 after all that time, and she's pissed off.  There are people every year, their rent goes up $50, $100 a month.  No problem.  Paul on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, my mom.  Hey, my mom's apartment in Brooklyn, $275 a month. 
[00:36:30]  $275.  Four rooms.  She's been there for about like 35 years.  She raised us there.  And now she's got Social Security.  She's living like a queen.  You know who winds up paying?  Do you know the people that rent in the building that don't have rent control departments?  Yeah, but it's all fucking Russian immigrants and Pakistanis.  Pakistanis.  Yeah, the Russians are taking over.  I mean, let's be honest here.  They do have their industries, and buildings are one of them. 
[00:37:00]  That's for sure.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Watch out, boys.  Well, that's just a quickie that just amazed us this morning.  The other big story, Anthony.  Union Square.  Goonian Square, Opie.  Yeah, exactly.  Mega Popsicle is beat by heat.  One of these goofy things that these companies like to do.  Thank God that no one suggested that we broadcast from the world's largest Popsicle.  The world's largest Popsicle.  A 25-foot, 17-ton Popsicle made of the supposed best stuff on Earth, melted in the New York sun yesterday, turning Union Square into a river of kiwi strawberry snapple. 
[00:37:30]  Enough of the goddamn giant food product things.  Is that what we...  Did you see they had the world's biggest pizza again?  Sorry, the world's biggest square pizza.  Hold on.  Because I guess there's a record for the round one.  Hold on.  We've got to go back to the phones because Jimmy in Tennessee cannot believe what we just said.  Jimmy, go ahead.  Hi, guys. 
[00:38:00]  This is why...  Love the show.  This is why I love doing a national talk show now.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm having a hard time understanding $5,000 a month for an apartment.  Yeah, people pay $5,000 a month for an apartment.  That is unreal, guys.  Dude, people pay $20,000.  Yeah.  Guys, athletes and stuff that live in buildings, there's $20,000 a month apartments in New York.  That's not...  Easily.  Yeah, that's not the average, obviously.  Right.  But I guess what we're trying to say is for a three-bedroom apartment in the New York area,  that could cost you $5,000 easily. 
[00:38:30]  Easily.  Easily.  You renting, Jimmy?  No, no.  I'm a homeowner in Tennessee.  What's the rent down there for, like, an apartment?  For...  Well, it's more houses.  Yeah.  Apartments, I mean...  How about this, Jimmy?  I'm not really sure.  Apartments, apartments, maybe $350,000, $400,000 per bedroom.  Jimmy, how much are you paying on your house a month?  My house payment is around $1,300 a month.  And how many rooms?  It's a three-bedroom, $1,580-square-foot house.  There you go.  On an acre of land. 
[00:39:00]  See?  On an acre of land.  Very nice.  All right.  Thank you.  $5,000.  Yeah, that's what people deal with up here.  Yeah, he couldn't believe it.  We had to go back to the phone.  Jimmy in Tennessee, he was like, that has to be wrong.  No.  He thought we might have meant $500.  Five G's.  Bob in Jersey, Bob.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, you know, I grew up in an apartment in your neighborhood, 70th and Columbus.  It had been my parents since, like, the early 50s.  When my father finally passed, he was paying $75 a month for a three-bedroom apartment. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, my God.  And, in fact, to get him out, the landlord paid him $150,000.  Right.  It's worth it.  Because once he left, then it wasn't rent-controlled anymore.  Yeah, there you have it.  Yeah, the landlords will do all sorts of stuff to get you out of there.  My friend owns a building.  He said they do that sometimes.  You just give the guy cash to leave.  He just gives you a bag of cash to say, just go, and they go.  It's worth it, yeah.  All right, Bob.  Can you imagine?  $75 a month?  All right, getting back to the Snapple faux pas, Anthony.  So, they try to do this world's largest popsicle, and you're saying enough of these. 
[00:40:00]  Enough with the big food.  Does anyone really care?  Does anyone care that a company makes a giant Pop-Tart or giant pizza, giant hamburger?  Who cares?  It's not real.  I mean, like when they make the giant hamburger?  Yeah.  It's not a giant hamburger.  It's a lot of little hamburgers making a giant hamburger.  That's what they did with the big square pizza, by the way.  It was a bunch of regular slices of pizza put together to look like a giant pizza,  and then they had people come up and eat it, so they grab a slice. 
[00:40:30]  It's not a giant pizza.  No, you want to, if you're going to set these records, you need a giant oven.  A continuous crust that is uncut.  Somehow, you have to work the dough.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, you're going to have to work the dough somehow and spread it out, put the sauce on.  Some of your sausage.  A little sugar.  Wine.  I have to cook for all the city.  So, the Snapple people got this great idea.  They're getting a lot of publicity today.  The world's largest popsicle, 25 foot, like we said, 17 tons. 
[00:41:00]  And the thing, obviously, because it was like 90 degrees yesterday, started melting like crazy as they're trying to get it off the truck.  Great place to do this.  And what the hell were they going to do with this?  It's just a big block of frozen Snapple.  A sticky block of ice and sugar is what it was.  And then they had it on a truck, and it looked like the truck, like it was a dump truck kind of thing.  So, they tipped it up, thinking this thing was going to slide out, and just this liquid came pouring out.  And they looked very concerned.  Pouring out. 
[00:41:30]  Like it came running to the back.  It turned into like a little pond down there.  Yeah, it was a pond of sticky mess.  And then what happened, now all this sticky mess is all over the street down there in Union Square.  Where bicyclists wiped out in the stream of goo, pedestrians slipped and fell, and traffic was, well, frozen.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's terrific.  That's exactly what it says in the paper.  Traffic was, well, frozen. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, it was very slippery, and they showed some bicyclists falling on their asses.  It's good to know that they failed, just like I failed back in the day with the smallest kite thing with my fellow students.  Oh, there you go.  At Oldfield's Junior High, Anthony.  Snapple officials had hoped to get in the Guinness Book of World Records and promote their new line of ice treats.  Instead, New Yorkers got a first of its kind, first day of summer mess.  That's good, though, because that won't attract rats or anything else.  I was just thinking that.  Down in the sewers, all that sugar. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, it was a big boo-boo, said Kizzy Vazquez, 28 of Manhattan.  Kizzy?  Jesus, before she spit in the water of a white lady and handed it to her.  And she watched the mammoth pink pop ooze while someone with a sick sense of humor blasted cruel summer over a sound system.  Oh, that's funny.  What's so sick about that?  Yeah, that's sick, man.  That's sick.  Oof.  They should have had that up before the sun came out, whatever that means. 
[00:43:00]  I guess it would have made a difference if they did this before it got really hot.  Wouldn't have melted if they were taking it out, probably.  I guess so.  No.  And all over the, you know, all the wiring and stuff that's underneath the streets that are always being chewed through by rats?  Now they're going to be sugar-coated.  That's great.  Everything down there is now sugar-coated in the manholes.  Mmm.  Mm-hmm.  Nibble away.  Speaking of the world's largest ice pot that's drippy, where's Ben?  We've got to get him in here. 
[00:43:30]  Another giant, delicious treat.  He went down to the CBS FM Oldies rally yesterday.  We've got to get into that as well.  I'm just seeing if there's anything else worth talking about in this article.  Ah.  It's a tough break, said Stuart Claxon of the Guinness Book of World Records.  Oh, the queen.  On the sticky scene.  The queen of England watching Ozzy.  That's interesting on the news.  Who was she watching Ozzy for?  It looked like she was digging it.  Yeah, of course.  That was probably some, you know, the, it was kind of, I was going to say funny, but it's 
[00:44:00]  not funny, but the damn firefighters had a hose down the street.  Yeah, they're called in for this, the firefighters, so there's a big fire truck there, and they're  hosing down the streets, trying to get this gooey mess off of there.  Yeah, that's what they want to do.  Yeah.  While they're on their jobs there.  Yeah.  Hose down the street because a big popsicle was melting.  Like, they don't have better things to do with their time.  Right.  They've got to now go out there because a popsicle melted and spray the road down. 
[00:44:30]  Great.  So there you have it.  Wonderful use of our resources.  Another huge story in New York today.  Where's Ben?  Let's get Ben in here and the rest of the gang.  They went down to the CBS FM Oldies Rally, Anthony.  You want to, like, set this up again?  We lost our oldie station here in New York, and it turns out...  Flipped to the Jack format.  It turns out no one really cares.  No one cares except for a handful of people that lived for CBS FM, the oldie station. 
[00:45:00]  And they flipped formats.  They went to this Jack format.  Jesus.  Text message coming in.  Oh, from Elo?  Yes, from Elo.  What does it say?  Don't forget to mention that oldies can be heard on the 50s and 60s channels on XM Satellite Radio.  He's good.  Jesus.  He's good.  Enough with the promoting.  No one cares, Elo, about oldies.  That's what it comes down to.  No one gives a flying...  What's up, Ben? 
[00:45:30]  Pat from Wunaki seems to think the popsicle stuff all washed down into the gutter, the rats eating it,  might be a few poor diabetic rats running around with one less toe, one less little claw on their foot.  That's a rat's diabetics?  All right.  And someone else right under, Pat, goes, Pat from Wunaki cares about giant food.  Yeah, big fat people.  Those are the only people that care about giant pizzas.  People are calling in with their rent. 
[00:46:00]  Jay, Missouri.  He has 160 acres, five bedrooms, $400 a month.  160 acres?  In Missouri.  160 acres in Missouri.  Wow.  Tennessee, Tony calling in, $350 a month for 1,600 square feet.  Some dude in Arkansas pays $500 a month for his house.  Yeah, people are just shocked all over the country that this is what you have to deal with in New York  if you want to live in an apartment.  Joe from Jersey. 
[00:46:30]  Jim, your sinuses sound terrible.  Oh.  Really, are you?  Let's hear what Joe has to say.  Joe, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I'm just really concerned about our little Jimmy.  What's wrong with my sinuses?  Am I sniffling?  Yeah, you sound really bad with your sinuses.  I was eating, too.  That might have been it.  But what do you mean?  I'm breathing okay.  Yeah, the last couple of days.  Oh.  I don't know.  I think maybe you should just go back to the blow and call it even.  I clear you out.  I have to go get sinus surgery. 
[00:47:00]  Oof.  It might be Ben's hog trying to breathe.  Trapped in those pants.  Trapped in those.  Thanks, sir.  All right.  Let's go to Dan in Iowa.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  A pizza they made here in Iowa, and it cost $45,000 in ingredients, and they did it for charity, and it reads like $3,500.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, but it's not a real giant pizza.  It's a fake giant pizza.  A bunch of little pizzas put together. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  That's about 30 miles from my house.  I saw the picture in the paper, and that's what it was.  It was like, you know, a little cookie sheet pizza all stacked together.  Yeah, that's not the world's biggest pizza.  Yeah, pretty cheesy.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Let's go to Pete in Miami.  Pete, go ahead.  Yeah, it's funny how in America, you know, we make these giant foods, and no one eats it.  It all rots and gets, like, ridden by flies.  And in Cambodia, people are starving for, like, a grain of rice.  And here, we just make these things just as a piece of shit, you know? 
[00:48:00]  People starving in Cambodia anymore?  I don't know.  That was like the old place to say it.  People are starving in Cambodia.  Bangladesh.  People are starving in Bangladesh.  We definitely make it easy for the rest of the world to hate us at times.  Oh, at times, I even look, and I'm Mr. Pro-American, and I look sometimes and just go, this is why the world hates us.  Yeah, the rest of the world is looking at our world's largest pizza that no one's ever going to eat.  Yeah, the world's largest pizza with their big, starving eyes.  Right. 
[00:48:30]  Looking, I hate these people.  Just licking their chops.  I hate you guys.  All right, Ben, you went down to the CBS FM oldies rally?  Oh, yeah.  CBS!  It was a freak show, huh?  What a bunch of zilchers.  Yeah, there's photos up on opiananthony.com.  Just a bunch of losers.  My favorite was some of the signs.  Infinity was rude on taking CBS off the air, and just some real winners.  Celebrity signing, too.  Roger.  Remember Roger, our old promotion friend?  Roger!  He's the one that wanted us to broadcast next to the giant Pop-Tart.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  He was our promotions guy, and that was his first big promotions idea.  Did you see that one sign that was down there?  Ben's hog is so big, there's still snow on it in the summertime.  Ha-ha, I got that email, too.  How long is that email?  I saw one.  Ben's hog is so big, it has casters.  The fact that this guy took whoever it is, I mean, how many pages is that thing?  Like, ten pages?  Ben's hog is so big, he has to call it Mr. Ben's hog in front of company. 
[00:49:30]  Ben's hog is so big, it won't return Spielberg's calls.  Ben's hog is so big, it graduated a year ahead of him from high school.

Ben's hog is so big, it has an elevator and a lobby. 
[00:50:00]  Ben's hog is so big, it votes.  Ben's hog is so big, no matter where Ben goes, his hog always gets there first.  The one above that's even funnier.  Ben's hog is so big, Hank Aaron used it to hit his 750th hole run.  Ben's hog was once the ambassador to China. 
[00:50:30]  Ben's hog is so big, it has investors.  Talk about CBS FM, Ralph, please.  Ben's hog is so big, it has feet?  Jesus.  Ben's hog is so big, it has an opening act.  Let's see.  Ben's hog is so big, it uses a hula hoop as a cock ring.

Ben's hog is so big, it can fucking elevate a shaft.  Ben's hog is so big, the city had to carve a hole in the middle of it so cars could get through. 
[00:51:30]  Ben's hog is so big, it needs an airplane warning light.  Ben's hog is so big, it has its own Wheaties box.  Hawk, you want to read one?  Why don't you read one?  Oh, come on, why don't you jump in and read one, be fun.  First of all, Jim, it's E-Rock from now on.  E-Rock?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, why don't you read one?  E-Rock, I like that.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  All right, E-Rock?  E-Rock hates E-Rock.  Oh, read one. 
[00:52:00]  E-Rock.  There's only a hundred of them.  I know, Jesus.  There's way more than a hundred, actually.  The inside of Ben's hog contains billions and billions of stars.  Ben's hog is so big, it has elbows.  Ben's hog is so big, that we're all a part of it, and it's a part of all of us.  Ben's hog is so big, it violates 17 zoning laws.  That's a good one.  That's funny. 
[00:52:30]  Ben's hog is so big, it has stairs up the center like the Statue of Liberty.  Ben's hog is so big, he was once in Ohio and got a blowjob in Tennessee.  Ben, you want to read one?  No, thanks.  I saw it last night.  No, thanks.  Hawk?  E-Rock.  Get it straight.  Oh, come on, read one.  You can't, you got to read one.  Don't put it in your shy for.  Yeah.  E-Rock.

[00:53:00]  Hawk?  E-Rock.  All right, we got plenty of those.  We'll go back to the Ben's hog, one-liners in a little while.  Bring back New York City's best oldies.  CBS FM, the greatest hits of all time.  One of the many signs down there.  So it was a freak show, huh?  Yeah, a real bunch of winners.  There was nobody there.  Maybe a hundred people if they were lucky.  Wow, the listeners sure do step up to the plate.  Ben's hog is so big, F-14s occasionally practice carrier landings on it. 
[00:53:30]  Ben's hog is so big that the toll booths charge him for two axles.  Ben's hog is so big, he's required to pull over at weigh stations on the highway.  Very funny.  Very good.  Ben's hog is so big, 35 people have died trying to reach its summit. 
[00:54:00]  Ben's hog has its own airbag.  Ben's hog is so big, he entered it in a big dick contest, and it came in first, second, and third.  Ben's hog is so big, it has a three-picture deal.  Did we do that one?  No.  That's a pretty good one.  All right.  All right.  CBS.  Why wouldn't that be good?  CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS, CBS. 
[00:54:30]  People have just been torn up about this.  Their loss of the...  Ah, very funny.  Very good.  Ben's hog is so big, 35 people have died trying to reach its summit.  Ben's hog has its own airbag.  Ben's hog is so big, he entered it in a big dick contest, and it came in first, second, and third. 
[00:55:00]  Ben's hog is so big, it has a three-picture deal.  Did we do that one?  No.  That's a pretty good one.  All right.  CBS.  Why wouldn't we do that one?  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  People have just been torn up about this. 
[00:55:30]  Their loss of the oldie station in New York, and I guess they finally got together a rally.  Did you look at the pictures?  Oh, I looked at some of the pictures.  They're up on Foundry.  Very, very funny.  There was one dude that was bald, but he had long hair, and he had it combed over, and  he was like the man guy.  Was it a skullet?  Did he have a skullet?  Yeah, exactly.  Or was it the big, long, sweeping comb over?  No, well, he's in a photo.  He's on there.  Yeah.  But he was like, save the oldies, man. 
[00:56:00]  Man, you've got to save the oldies, man.  And he was all against satellite radio.  He's like, it's all, you know, it was just, he was a retard.  Anything the future, he hates.  Anything new.  Anyone that listened to that goddamn CBS FM for more than two seconds, they don't like  anything new, anything different.  One person, what was their sign?  It was like their life?  You've taken away our life or something?  How about this?  Buy the Dick Clark collection. 
[00:56:30]  Shut the fuck up.  There you go.  That's a good point.  They got compilation discs all over the damn place.  Unbelievable.  I see some signs.  Hit the road, Jack.  Well, they were chanting that.  They were singing that.  Oh, they were.  And the best part was Joe Hollander, you know, was the boss of Infinity, walked by and  none of them even knew who he was.  Yeah, there's like the big boss.  They could have had the guy's ear.  The boss.  It's like having a problem with your computer and Bill Gates walks by and you could actually 
[00:57:00]  say, what the fuck's wrong with Windows?  That's what this guy is, Joe Hollander.  And they didn't even know.  They didn't even know who he was.  These idiots are sitting there protesting.  He walked by, he checked out everybody's sign.  You know, he's checking it all out.  We love Joe Hollander.  And Joe Hollander loves us.  But unfortunately, there's a radio genius.  There's a bunch of people still in the company that absolutely hate the O.P. and Anthony  program.  But if it was up to Joe, he would be giving us some prime time slots all over the country. 
[00:57:30]  Get over it.  101.1 WCBS and 10 New York.  CBS!  Welcome back!  Blah, blah, blah.  Shut up.  Oh, look at this on the New York Radio message board.  Rally is over.  Next steps.  Like, that was just, that was just plan A.  Now we need a new CD player.  Problem?  I bet it works over at Jack. 
[00:58:00]  Uh-oh.  You got it.  That one...  No, whatever.  There it goes.  Yeah, oh yeah, it'll work now.  Someone at the...  There you go.  Next step would be find pipe.  Throw one end of rope over end.  Get stole.  Ah, CBS FM.  A couple of minutes past 11 o'clock in the city. 
[00:58:30]  With the greatest hits of all time.  This is Ron Lundy.  Hello.  This is Ron Lundy.  Talking over the music.  Fucking jocks.  Awful.  This guy's suggesting that the rally didn't really do much.  Yeah.  Said he had a chance to peek at the rally outside.  While it was nice to see people stand up for what we all believe in, it really had no impact.  You've got to understand that MTV Studios in that building often attracts crowds double that size as fans and groupies try to catch a glimpse of their idols. 
[00:59:00]  Additional rallies will have no impact on Infinity and Jack.  If you want to have an impact, you have to get at Jack's cash flow, he's saying.  And then he has this form letter that you can print out and sign to the sponsors at Jack.  It tells them, what he's trying to say, they took off a very popular station, blah, blah, blah.  That never works.  It just never works.  Because they wouldn't have taken it off if they had a big enough listener base to affect the advertisers. 
[00:59:30]  Because if people were listening, they would never have taken it off.  Exactly.  You know what's funny, though?  The ratings came out for New York Radio and CBS FM.  Oldies went way up.  How often does that happen when a station changes format stuff?  They change and the last ratings for the station that was on there before always goes up.  It went up.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Indiana.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, Owen.  What's up, fellas?  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that Vince's hog is so big, it has other smaller hogs orbiting around it. 
[01:00:00]  True.  Ben, comment.  Dan from Missouri.  Go ahead, Dan.  Shunt comment.  Great show, fellas.  Thank you.  Able Knievel.  Oh, shit.  Vince hogs the big Able Knievel wants to jump in.  You think.  You did a punchline right away.  Let's get to the punchline.  Able Knievel.  Able Knievel.  Wait.  Hold on.  Able Knievel.  Shit.  Oh.  His big moment and he blew it.  Regina in Georgia. 
[01:00:30]  Milker on the ceiling.  Oh, shit.  You stick him to the window.  Wait a minute.  God damn it.  Go ahead, Regina.  Hey, maybe Ben's hog is really a third leg and he was born with an undeveloped twin hook  to him.  Oh, very nice.  Smooth delivery.  Format.  Geez.  Not quite the format of the Ben's hog is so big.  No need to do jokes.  Just speculate.  Possibly Ben is deformed.  Way to wreck it.  The other thing, to go back to the advertisers, if you saw the people, if you look at the  pictures, would these people really be the ones, I mean, just look at the people over 
[01:01:00]  there.  And they went way out of the demo.  Ben's hog is so big it has advertisers.  Yeah.  How about that?  Someone said that Ben's hog is so big it has its own oldies station.  Ben's hog is so big its format switched to jack.  That's what CBS is.  This cock is big and suckable.  All right.  We got some audio.  We went down to the CBS FM oldies rally.  And we messed with the people a little bit.  Sort of.  Yeah.  A little bit of everything.  You didn't even have to mess with them, I bet. 
[01:01:30]  I bet they're just talking.  They're just going to say dumb stuff.  Let's go to the tape.  I mean, the jack format, they're saying that they play what they want.  Well, you know, if I want to listen to something else, New York is so diverse with what they  have.  There's like a hundred different hip hop stations that you can listen to.  Actually, there's two.  There's two.  There's two.  Well, still.  A hundred different hip hop stations.  Still.  All right, two.  Well, still.  Still.  We want our oldies in New York City the way they were because that's where they belong.  What? 
[01:02:00]  She was out of her mind.  That one was nuts.  Oh, God.  Do you imagine having to deal with this woman?  We want our oldies in New York City the way they were because that's where they belong.  The way they were because that's where they belong.  That's kind of a Hillary cadence to her.  We want our oldies.  Oh.  We got more of the crazy lady.  I'm out here today because on June 3rd, 2005, we lost the best oldie station in the world 
[01:02:30]  and they play all the music and we got shafted.  Sounds like Marion a little bit.  Doesn't it sound like Marion?  And we got shafted.  It's a dumb radio station.  Shafted.  They're protesting over a jukebox going away.  It's your, yeah, it's a radio station that decided they wanted to change what they own.  This is like going.  They belong to you, people.  This is like going to your favorite bar over and over again and there's that jukebox.  And it plays all your songs that you love.  And you go there.  You even know the numbers of that Doris song and that Charlie Daniels song and this and that. 
[01:03:00]  And one day you go there and the jukebox is no longer around.  Are you going to organize a protest over the jukebox?  Well, yes, I would.  Being taken out of the local dive?  I would.  Jesus.  I am stupefied. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  Yeah, that's what they were doing.  They were singing Hit the Road Jack.  You know, in the 60s, and I'm a 52-year-old guy, they played a lot of songs.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  All right, let's have a contest.  Find what was wrong with that statement. 
[01:04:00]  All right, let's do it.  Are you shitting me?  Holy crap.  Maybe I heard wrong.  Maybe I heard wrong.  Could you play that again?  Because I want to hear something.  You know, in the 60s, and I'm a 52-year-old guy, they played a lot of songs.  All right.  Over and over again.  I see what you're talking about.  You sound younger.  It didn't matter.  Yes, the world is changing, but you don't.  People are still alive.  Okay?  I'm only 52.  There are a lot of people who do care about the human touch in radio.  We're losing that. 
[01:04:30]  But I...  And then...  But he said...  But she...  And then...  Does someone have what that thing looked like?  Yeah, we have a picture of that.  Was it a guy?  Was it a woman who misspoke and said, I'm a guy?  Jack is not a person.  Jack is a computer.  This is a...  Man!  ...world. 
[01:05:00]  If that's what we're going to have to live by.  Was there...  No, I mean, whoever was there, do you remember interviewing this person?  Was it a guy, or a...  It was a guy.  Yeah, it's definitely a guy.  Obviously, Ben got his hog and balls.  Because that person doesn't have any male genitalia.  Yeah, Ben should cut off seven inches for this guy.  Come on, Ben.  Give him a nut.  Give him seven inches of that goodness.  Mark in New York, what's up? 
[01:05:30]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I want to know if Ben Tog squirted anybody in the eye while I was interviewing them.  You don't do it the way they did it, also.  The way they did it was really a hijacking.  They didn't tell anybody.  All of a sudden, boom, it was done.  That shows no respect.  In fact, they're still showing no respect.  You listen to W101.1, Jack FM.  They say things that are really disrespectful of everybody.  I can't picture that voice coming out of a guy. 
[01:06:00]  He should be saying to John Voight, you were going to ask me for money?  That's what he said.  Sylvia Miles, this asshole, sounds like.  I can't picture that voice coming out of a guy.  Maybe if I saw a picture.  Yeah, we're trying to find a picture.  Rich in New York.  James, what are you doing, fellas?  Hey.  Just wanted to say that Ben Tog is so big that the Smith children could have used it as a  flotation device.  Ah, yes. 
[01:06:30]  Could have been a lifesaver, Ben.  Yes.  Let's go to Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff?  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, Ben Tog's so big it's got bone cancer.  Dave in Jersey.  The whole country getting involved with the Ben Tog jokes.  Go ahead, Dave.  It's not jokes.  They're factual little tidbits.  I'm sorry.  Tidbits of fact.  Dave?  Joe, what do you mean?  Ah, yeah, you.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, I was going to say, Ben Tog is so big it has its own hair salon that Anthony goes  to. 
[01:07:00]  Ben Tog.  Ben Tog.  That's pretty funny.  The think tank at WCBS, I have no idea what they were thinking, but.  Their thinking was totally wrong.  Oldies now, they have Oldies Cruises, Oldies Shows.  Oldies are new.  Oldies will never be old.  Wow.  Okay, hold on.  Whew.  Oldies.  If this isn't showing that Infinity made the right decision, this is their representation.  Oldies never get old.  I get my DeLorean.  I go back in time and the Oldies are new. 
[01:07:30]  But now, they'd be old.  Oldies Cruises.  But then I.  Oldies Cruises.  Ugh.  Just send them out, light it on fire like one of those big Viking funerals for these  fossils.  An Oldies Cruise.  That's got to be a treat to be on.  How much adult diaper load can you smell?  I was online to go to the movies the other day and it's got to be awful.  I mean, there is some sympathy in me for this. 
[01:08:00]  But there was an old guy standing in front of me online, just taking forever at the ticket  counter.  And I'm one of those guys at the ticket counter.  I have my money.  I need two tickets for this movie.  Here's the money.  Give me the change.  Boom.  I'm gone.  I cannot fathom what these people are doing at the ticket counter that takes so long.  I want to see the sisterhood of the pants.  And I want to, how many, two, two, senior, oh, three, senior ticket. 
[01:08:30]  I'm sitting there like, you should do this before him.  And wafting out of his pants was the smell of shit and piss in a powdery scented diaper  smell.  And I'm standing there going, this old guy has shit himself and he's online at the movies  and...  Just to sit in it for three more hours. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, right.  Now he's got to sit in it for three hours to watch a movie.  And you know, back in the day, I'm sure back in the 40s, 50s, he was probably a go-getter.  You know?  Now he's shitting, sitting in his own shit, watching Sisterhood of the Fucking Pants, whatever  that is, a chick flick, with his corpse next to him.  Oh.  Let's go to David.  David, what's up?  Hey, man.  I heard that Ben's hog was so big, it was once used for three weeks as a hiding place by 
[01:09:30]  a girl in Aruba.  Oh.  The police should check out your hog, Ben.  Yeah.  Oldies now!  Oldies now!  Oldies now!  This is pathetic.  You know, as they're doing this, their lights at home are turning on and off, on and off.  Oldies now!  Oldies now!  Oldies now!  Oldies now!  Oldies now! 
[01:10:00]  Oldies now!  Wow, that's a hell of a rally.  Oldies now!  Now!  Hit that road, Jack!  Don't you come back!  Oldies now!  I'm a radio listener, and I want my Beach Boys, my Beatles, my Monkeys, by Earl Lewis and  the Channel, I want all my music.  He said there are only two.  The happenings, the fucking hands, you name it, I want it. 
[01:10:30]  Because...  System of a down, all that good stuff.  Yeah, all that good stuff.  I just want it.  Mushroom head, all that old stuff like that, right?  Yeah.  That's good stuff?  Yeah, mushroom head.  That's great stuff.  Days of the new.  Yeah, you got it.  Days of the new.  Oh, Jesus.  Everyone here, all my friends, I mean, I'm 26 years old.  I grew up listening to this music.  It doesn't offend anyone.  I mean, it's real clean music.  It's about happiness and everything.  It's about happiness. 
[01:11:00]  It's real clean music.  It doesn't offend anybody.  I like oldies, but I hate DJs who talk in the beginning.  I'm sorry.  I like the computer better.  Play the music and just shut up.  They talk for 15 seconds.  I don't mind that.  They're not bothering anyone.  They talk over the music.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Jack is a computer, man.  Oh, that guy.  That one guy was like that.  Yeah, he's a computer.  It's 2005.  Everything should be computerized.  It's a lot nicer.  A lot cleaner.  No filthy people in charge of anything. 
[01:11:30]  But the computer is playing people.  It's not like it's just playing computer noises.  Right.  It's really boop.  It's playing people singing.  Can you tell me what your sign says?  My sign says, Jack is what?  Give us our oldies back.  WCBS FM 101.1 New York's oldies station.  Oh.  Get all the names of the DJs.  Harry Harrison, Cousin Brucie, Bobby J, Don K. Reed, Bob Shannon, Mickey the Monkees, Dolans,  Mr. Bill Brown in the afternoon, Mike Fitzgerald, Randy Davis, and of course, hello, live Ron 
[01:12:00]  Lundy on a Monday morning.  How you doing, folks?  I think they ought to give us our station back because this is ridiculous.  I want to hear the great song that I always love hearing.  Where else could you get the Beatles, the Monkees, the Beach Boys, but not to mention some of the  lesser-known groups.  The fucking Naps are stupid.  The fucking Naps, the Happenings.  Herman's Hermits.  Herman's Hermits, the Dave Clark Five.  Oh, everybody loves the Dave Clark Five.  Everybody.  Is Ron Lundy your favorite? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, he's my favorite.  Can you do some more of an impression of him?  Sure.  How you doing, folks?  Welcome on a New York Monday morning.  Hello, love.  This is Ron Lundy at C-Beatle SFM 101.1.  What you want?  I got it for you.  He used to say C-Beatle...  What?  That was his thing?  C-Beatles S?  C-Beatles S?  F?  C-Beatles S?  C-Beatles S?  What?  C-Beatles S?  That's awful. 
[01:13:00]  C-Beatles S?  C-Beatles S?  That guy should be shown to a glass-sliding door with a pillow and a gun and a tape recorder.  Oh, it hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  I'm dying.  C-Beatles S.  It's more than just about the music.  It's about the memories because the DJs not only brought you the music, but they interconnected  with the fans and they gave you the stories behind the songs, what was involved.  Well, you can't buy those kind of memories. 
[01:13:30]  What?  The corporate dollar can only buy you so much.  Right.  You cannot buy, you know, and sell, well, the demographics.  I'm not a demographic.  I'm a person.  He's a person.  He's a person.  Even the people that they're trying to target to, those are young people.  They're not demographics.  Yes, they are, asshole.  Yes, they are.  I guess some people might argue that since you probably own all this music already, you  can just, you know, play it at home.  What would you say to that?  It's not the same because you don't get the DJs playing a doc for you and you don't get 
[01:14:00]  the great memories, you know.  When you listen to it and you listen to a DJ say, remember that hit song from 67?  It takes you back.  What memory would, you know, come back when they play something, say, from, you know,  67, like you said.  What's your favorite memory?  Oh, that's easy.  I was very sick when I was a kid.  I had polio.  And that was when my leg braces came off.  I started walking, hopping around.  And in fact, I've got an interesting story for you.  It's real simple.  I was very sick. 
[01:14:30]  My grandmother said I couldn't speak.  I couldn't talk for some reason.  So they brought in a TV with a color to try to point out shapes and stuff.  And at one point she heard a song coming over from the TV and it was, here we come, in Spanish,  walking down this street.  The theme song from the Monkees.  And she hears a familiar voice.  Who's singing that?  And it was me.  I'm starting to sing a song that I knew nothing about before.  So every time she gets, she hears that, she says, hey, that's the song that got you started 
[01:15:00]  talking and everything.  I never knew that.  I said, those are great memories to me.  It has to mean something to me.  That's a good story.  Thanks for your time, Matt.  That's a good story.  Thanks for your time, you nut.  Oh, you guys wimped out.  I would have said, what is your, what is wrong?  What's your major malfunction, nut nut?  Exactly.  Matt in Philly, what's up?  Ben's hog is so big, it's the new serious portable unit.  Fuck him.  That's pretty big.  Let's go to Maine.  Jared.  Ben's hog is so big, every time he has sex, it turns into a crime scene. 
[01:15:30]  John in Maryland.  Hey, guys.  Ben's hog is so big, it orders one of everything at McDonald's.  Randy in New York.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Ben's hog is so big, you have to pay a $7 toll to cross it.  Cole in Philly.  Cole!  Hey, what's up?  It's Missouri.  Anyway, hey, I got two.  Ben's hog is so big, it's got its own gift shop.  And Ben's hog is so big, when it performs live at SeaWorld, the first three rows will get wet. 
[01:16:00]  That's pretty good.  Do you remember where you were when you heard the station switch?  Yes, I had gotten in my car at my train station.  Oh, what a great loaded question, man.  Yes, I do remember where I was.  Yeah, this is just like the space shuttle exploding.  Reports are now coming in, and CBS FM has switched to the Jack format. 
[01:16:30]  Do you remember where you were when you heard the station switch?  Yes, I had gotten in my car at my train station, and I heard them playing Rock Lobster by the B-52s.  I said, hey, wow, they're expanding their format a little.  B-52s sound a little bit like an old girls' group from the 60s, so I said, this is great.  And then the next song was something, might have been U2.  I said, wait, something's up.  I like U2, but this station shouldn't be playing that.  So he likes the music so far.  And then they went into the whole Jack thing and played some more hard rock, and I said, uh-oh, something happened here. 
[01:17:00]  And when I came home, I told my partner, who was in a state of shock, we couldn't believe it.  All right, by the way, shock is not the state that he's in, sir.  He might have been that day walking out of the doctor's office.  My partner was so upset, he just clutched his robe up by his neck.  I said, they switched to Jack, and he said, that's what got me in trouble in the first place. 
[01:17:30]  Let's go to Paul in Texas.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, Ben's home's so big, he costs $5,000 for his apartment in it.  He charges $5,000 for the apartment in it.  That sucks? 
[01:18:00]  Let's go back to...  By the way, is that Lindsay Lohan?  Yes.  She's got to be hiding an awful hairline.  Whenever people start wearing those headband-type things, their hairline is atrocious.  I think she does have, like, a five-head, but she's real...  Look how skinny she is.  Something is wrong with her, man.  She doesn't look good at all.  She has 40-year-old woman skin.  Yeah, look!  Because she's all...  She had some bulk to her.  She wasn't fat.  She looked good.  That's not a newspaper.  Yeah, she's all like...  That's a tabloid magazine.  You're skinny.  How do you feel about the stories about weight?  You look great to me. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  You look great, but I do remember when you used to come here and you were slightly heavier.  People want to just make sure you're...  I was...  I just hit puberty.  We've gotten to the puberty question here.  Well, I mean, you grow up.  You learn.  You're healthier.  You work out.  You do coke.  Your body's changing.  You're allergic.  I mean, I was top heavy then, and then they said I got implants, and if I did, I must  have gotten them taken out or something like that.  But, you know, it's just everyone will find anything. 
[01:19:00]  I just read that I was dating someone who's my friend.  He's in a band, and it's so funny because I was out to dinner with my friend, and he happened  to be there, and he said, I'm not going to get in the car with you.  And I said, just get in the car.  I said, I told you.  The second that we all went to dinner, I said, okay, I just want to let everyone here  know.  For the three guys that are here, and my friends agreed with me, I said, you just have to know  if you don't want to deal with this, then you can get up and leave dinner now, and we're  going to walk out.  It's a great dinner now.  We're going to walk out.  There's going to be a lot of cameras.  They're going to start saying one of you is dating me. 
[01:19:30]  I'm going to be pulling around with one of you.  So just deal with it.  You've got younger siblings who have interest in perhaps getting into the business.  Funny story.  Jesus.  He really is a get-to-the-bottom-of-nothing worm.  He's the worst.  He really is.  He is just, you look great to me.  Did you have to say that, you fucking Roman-haired fruit?  Just say.  Because he knows he has to talk about the weight loss, and that's how he softens up the question.  You look great to me, but people, you know, you used to come here, and you were slightly  heavier.  You had big tits. 
[01:20:00]  Where'd they go?  What happened?  He just handed me a Rocky Dennis picture.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  That's hilarious.  All right.  Let's go back to the...  The red hair is actually worse than the face.  Let's go back to the gentleman.  Something happened here, and when I came home, I told my partner, who was in a state of shock,  we couldn't believe it.  I thought I was hearing things, to hear that an institution of 33 years has gone from the  airwaves.  And so both you and your partner are big fans of the oldies? 
[01:20:30]  The oldies, yes.  Exactly, yeah.  And why do you think Infinity was extremely rude?  Extremely rude because, number one, I know they have to make business decisions, but  at least give the DJs and the listeners a chance to say goodbye, even a weekend, saying,  hey, we're changing formats, we're leaving.  But it's like pulling the plug.  It's like stabbing someone.  It's not like you do it in a graceful, mannerly way.  And Infinity should know better.  They're in business, and they should know to treat people with respect.  All right, thanks a lot for your time. 
[01:21:00]  Thank you.  It's like stabbing someone.  Gay, totally gay.  Liberace gay.  Why didn't they give them a weekend to say goodbye?  Why don't they do that?  That's not the radio way.  Yeah, why would you do that?  Then that's just, it doesn't make any sense.  It's actually, yeah, it's counterproductive.  You want to move forward.  You don't want to look and say, this was so good that we're going to do almost a tribute  to it by letting these people say goodbye.  You always try to make it look like this is a waste of time, what we were doing. 
[01:21:30]  We're moving on to something better and new, and no one cares that we're getting rid of it.  Yeah, in the end, it's just a business.  A restaurant goes under in your neighborhood.  They don't have a weekend of saying goodbye.  Yeah.  They just close it up.  Yeah, let's do a weekend of sushi before we switch to Italian.  Yeah, they don't give a fuck.  It's all business when it comes down to it.  It's all computers, man.  They make it sound like it's all one big happy family, but it's not.  You ever see 2001 A Space Odyssey, man? 
[01:22:00]  How?  It's all computers, and it's going to come down to that man.  Man.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Goddamn hippies.  Steve, what's going on?  Ben's hog is so big, his condom size is blimp.  You know, that's kind of funny because, was it yesterday?  A package came into the studio at the end of the show.  Oh, yeah, big heavy box.  It was a big heavy box, and what did you say, Jimmy?  I looked at it, and I said, that's one of Ben's condoms in his 20-pound box. 
[01:22:30]  Wayne in Tennessee.  Wayne.  Yeah, Ben's hog is so big that even when he's in New York City,  they found a boy scout behind it in Utah.  On your screen, too, by the way, that's the guy that was like, yeah, man.  He's like, terrestrial radio, man.  But it's not even that great of a shot because his hair was just the funniest thing.  They all look like psychopaths.  Yeah, let's go back to the tape.  Ben's hog is so big that when it sank, 1,100 men went into the water, 
[01:23:00]  316 men came out, sharks took the rest.  Well, let's go to Ray on Long Island.  Ray?  Ben's hog is so big that Ron Lundy talks into it for Echo.  Hello, Rob.  He almost self-destructed there, my friend.  He saved himself.  The numbers came out Monday evening.  Mickey Dolan's in the morning went up.  The entire station went up.  But in that target area of 25 to 34, the numbers went up. 
[01:23:30]  So CBS FM made a jump.  They were making money anyhow.  They billed last year at $34 million.  That's a lot of money.  Who knows what Jack will do, if anything.  And I'm not happy with this.  It's like iPod on radio.  I'm sorry, but it doesn't work for me.  It's not what I want to hear.  I want to be able to hear what's going on in the world.  I want to know how the stock market did.  I want to know how the Mets did last night. 
[01:24:00]  I want to know what my weather's like.  I want to know what my commute's like.  I'm not going to get that with Jack FM.  Read the paper.  Read the goddamn paper.  All-time favorite DJ was Dan Ingram.  Dan Ingram.  He, Ron Lundy, Harry Harrison, Jim Kerr, who was on Q104.  They were the reasons why I went to school to get my degree in broadcasting from Arizona State University.  They were the reasons why I went into radio to begin with.  And what do you do now for radio?  Now I'm out of radio. 
[01:24:30]  I'm now a courier in Manhattan.  Can you do an impression of your favorite DJ real quick?  Or anybody?  Anybody.  Anybody of your DJs?  Harry Harrison, CBS FM.  Every day should be on lap like a precious new gift.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for your time.  Thanks so much.  This is Mitch Beck.  You could have gotten Mike's job.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  Or Mad Dog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  What are you doing out here today?  I'm out here because I'm really disgusted with Finity Broadcasting System of what they did to CBS FM 101.1. 
[01:25:00]  I think it's a tragedy.  I think it's disgusting and despicable and deplorable that they did something like this without even telling anybody.  I mean, they shouldn't have done it, period.  But they should have given the disc jockeys at least a couple of weeks to get themselves together and say goodbye to the listeners.  A couple of weeks.  And everybody else that was, you know, that's involved with the radio station.  And it's terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  A couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks.  They should have, you know, given them a couple of years to say goodbye.  And finally, one last clip from the CBS FM Oldies rally held in New York City yesterday at noontime. 
[01:25:30]  I miss CBS FM, the Oldies.  I had to go out last week and get a serious boombox.  And they've been playing a lot of the oldies from the 50s on serious gold.  But I still miss CBS FM, the golden 101 FM.  It used to be the best station in New York City, really. 
[01:26:00]  But when Jack came in, they ruined the station altogether.  How'd they ruin it?  They ruined it by putting on 80s music.  They're not putting on anything else.  They're putting on 80s music.  They don't have DJs.  They don't have anybody.  So who wants to listen to a radio station like this?  How big is your serious boombox unit?  It's a big one.  Yes.  Do you remember where you were when you heard the station switch? 
[01:26:30]  I was listening to it before 5 o'clock.  After 5 o'clock, they changed to an 80s music, which I didn't like at all.  I turned it off altogether.  We've been hijacked over here.  We've been hijacked.  Who was your favorite DJ on CBS FM?  Cousin Brucie and Harry Harrison.  Can you do any impressions of Brucie?  Yeah.  Having a ball.  Any more?  Yeah, this is Cousin Brucie from CBS FM. 
[01:27:00]  Nice.  Okay, Sirius can have him.  I don't know.  That's the target.  Those are the people you want.  Buy it.  Listen to satellite radio.  And Sirius made that jump.  I'm sure he loves.  Wow.  Just rolling over down there in Washington.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  And as we said in the 60s, yee, yee, yee. 
[01:27:30]  Testing.  Testing.  Everybody who loved the 60s, say it, baby.  Say it, baby.  Don't do one.  Like we said in the 60s, yee, yee, yee.  When a thalidomide baby came out with flippers for arms, the doctors went, yee, yee, yee.  And I went, yee, yee.  And the maid of the east said, Sir, you're sitting in the wrong section of the restaurant.  There you have it.  Like we said in the 60s, yee, yee, yee. 
[01:28:00]  That's a whites only water fountain.  We've got to get more audio of Cousin Brucie.  Great memories.  He said some silly things.  Some silly things.  That's fantastic.  What are the rest of them going to do?  Sirius hired him, but when was Bruce Yon?  Was he the afternoon guy?  Evenings.  He was in the evenings?  Yep.  Oh.  Really?  Who even knows that?  I know.  Who cares?  I just knew they probably went in and taped everything, right?  I can't imagine those old guys sitting there the whole time. 
[01:28:30]  Yee, yee, yee.  As we say right now, yee, yee, my roids are killing me.  All right.  Was he on for a long time, Cousin Brucie?  Oh, my God.  Many, many years there, Jimmy.  Yeah, a long time.  Many, many years.  Welp.  I remember growing up hearing Cousin Brucie on the radio back in the olden days.  He's gone and nothing could be done.  Let's say hi to Ben in Brooklyn.  Ben, yeah.  They fucking changed formats. 
[01:29:00]  Ben.  Yeah.  Ben's hog is so big, when he crosses the street, two gates come down, and bells start ringing.  Mike in Minnesota.  Go ahead, Mike.  Ben's hog is so big, it once fell off the car seat and crushed his foot.  Mike in PA.  Ben's hog is so big, he had terrorists scoping it out. 
[01:29:30]  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman who sent his shirt off? 
[01:30:00]  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Show it, show it, you find me.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  I'm a smacking house.  The seventh tuners.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  I see your appointment.

[01:31:00]  Ah, I think that's spider bait  Oh, yeah?  Doing Ram Jams, Black Betty 
[01:31:30]  Not sure, though  A classic  It's the Opie and Anthony program  Fine, Wimble Mouth Wednesday  Hi  Wednesday  How are you?  I'm good  They did an article in the Daily News  Many men ejaculate in five minutes  Wow  In five minutes  And they have a  It's pretty funny, they got a picture  Let me get the picture for everybody  I know it's radio, but we'll make it make sense 
[01:32:00]  We'll paint the picture for you  That's what you learn in broadcasting school  Paint the picture  They show a guy in search of staying power  They show a guy in some kind of lounge pants  Opening up the front of his pants  Looking down disappointedly at his junk  Because it's not performing right  And I guess there's an experimental drug that treats premature ejaculation  And that's raising the  Raises the curtain  Okay  Alright, so there's a drug for this 
[01:32:30]  And now it's raising the curtain on a formerly taboo subject, Anthony  Taboo  Guys don't want to talk about how they ejaculate too quickly  Shoot the wad  And then they got a picture of a scene in the bedroom  With this really hot chick  And little white panties  And a little wife beater shirt  Yeah  And she's on the edge of the bed  All bummed out and disappointed  And the guy is holding his head in the background  Like  Aw  All a shame  For shame  For shame  For shame 
[01:33:00]  And the article starts  What's the difference between two minutes and seven minutes?  At first though  At first thought only five minutes  300 seconds  Not much time at all really  But for men who suffer from premature ejaculation  The most common sexual dysfunction among men of all age groups  It can mean the world  Five minutes doesn't sound like a long time  But it is  If you were to stare at a clock for five minutes  That would seem like a long time  If you were having sex  That time would seem even more valuable 
[01:33:30]  Says Stacy  Anyway  I wish I had that problem  I can't finish sometimes  That's what Ant and I were talking about  Well the more you do the fucking  Exactly  The longer you'll stay  If you take a time off  And then jam it in  You're going to shoot your load  Right  That's it  But the thing is  Then go do it again  Yeah our advice is just get back in the game  If you do it again  Then you're going to last for a long fucking time  Yeah you do  To the point where you go like  Oh Jesus  I think there's going to be chafing 
[01:34:00]  When you're up to the fifth time in  A day  Right  Day and a half  Oh man  But if you're a whole  You know  If you haven't had sex for a while  Or you get one of those  Yeah there are those times  Where you just go through the whole night  And you're having those dreams  And you got a  Like a rock hard heart on  The whole night  And you wake up  Have a little morning sex  Goodbye  Your dick's just waiting  It's just yearning for something 
[01:34:30]  I hate morning sex  You don't like the morning sex?  I can never do it  I like morning sex better than  Better than night sex  Dude the breath  Everyone's breath is awful in the morning  And then you're done for the day  After I fucking dump  I don't want to get up and face the day  I want to lay there in a coma  You left alone  Give me a sock  Let me wipe this off  And go back to bed  I'm not talking  You know you have a job to go to  How about the weekend?  Nice morning on the weekend  Just again 
[01:35:00]  The whole breath thing  Two bad breath people in the morning  You know I'm morning breath  You just look at each other  But it's  You're not breathing in each other's faces  Your faces are elsewhere  Things like that  Yeah  You gotta strategically move around there  Jimmy  Morning sex is great  Especially if you're out  Say you're at the hotel or something  You got nothing else to do  So you just spend the day in bed  You have the morning sex  Movies  Fun things like that  I wish I enjoyed it dude 
[01:35:30]  I really do  I know a lot of guys love it  I wish I did  You just dump and want the person gone  Is what it is  No I don't mind them saying there  But I just want to dollop it out  And collapse into  Dollop it out  You don't want to think that they're actually a human being  You just want it to be over with and done  I don't mind chit chatting afterwards a little bit  Like a little pillow talk  A little pillow talk  Could you leave please  Yeah  Hey listen  I would give you a cab  Boy she's a lucky gal  A little chit chat from Jim Norton after you're done 
[01:36:00]  Hi  Put the AC on high  You're laying under those  What's better than being under a comfort with the AC blasting  It's phenomenal  Yeah it was good  Your balls feel like concrete  That's good when the air conditioning is going  And you've got the comforter on  Because then if you do get hot  All you've got to do is raise the comforter up  And it sucks in the cold air from outside  I love it  It cools everything off  It has to be freezing when I sleep  Heat locker  A little comforter  I can't stand the cold in the winter 
[01:36:30]  But in the summer when it's hot out  I want it freezing wherever I am  Like I'm bitching about the cold  And in my car when it's winter  And I'm waiting for the heat to come on  I'm freezing and I'm pissed off  And then in the summer  I will turn my air conditioning up to  I swear  It looks like the cockpit of Payne Stewart's airplane  When I'm driving  You can barely even see me through the glaze of ice  You need an ice scraper for the inside  For the inside  I love when it's freezing cold in there  Alright the phones have exploded  Ben's raw ass  Go ahead 
[01:37:00]  Hey Ben's hog is so big that when he flies  American Airlines charges him for two seats  John in Nebraska  Hey guys good morning  Morning  The Navy just christened their new submarine  The USS Ben's hog  James  Hey  Hey  Hey Ben's hog is so big  They finally found out  That's what sucked at Memphis Joe  Mark in New York  Ben unzipped his fly  And out came his hog  Still at the end of our ship  And we said oh no it's a sea serpent

[01:38:00]  You know  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday  Monday, Tuesday  You're going to do much better than if you took off  You know Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday  You have sex on Friday  You know you're going to be a little backed up  Yeah but it's like when it happens  Then I have to look at her in the face and go  Sorry  Yeah that's going to suck that  Sorry  That's going to suck  You got a huge wiener and it can't do anything good  Yeah and it's like oh no I love going down on you  Because that's the only way that it will work  Spitting up like a sick baby all the time  You just touch it  All right 
[01:38:30]  All right Joe  All right  God I hung up on you Rob  It's not  Rob  Rob  Hey what's going on guys  We weren't feeling your Ben's hog joke  That's why I hung up on you  Oh okay no problem  What was it let's give it a shot  No Ben's hog is so big that  It just wants to total diabetes  Fucking out guys  A bad Pat from Wiennake reference  Ben's hog big fat 
[01:39:00]  I was hoping it would hang up on him  As soon as he started to talk  Got a big rosy head on it  Ben's hog  A big rosacea face  Want to just warm your hand and crisco  And just crisply slap it  So for the guys with the premature ejaculation  Ejaculation just get back into the game there  Jump in  All right  What happened with the Boy Scout  We found the Boy Scout  The Boy Scout  The Boy Scout was found  A missing scout 
[01:39:30]  Everyone thought they were going to find him dead  Yeah  What's the story just in case  Well he was at a little Boy Scout outing  Actually at 11 years old he was just a Cub Scout  But he was invited along as a guest  Of one of his friends who was a Boy Scout  And he was by the rock climbing wall  In some rock climbing gear  And somebody saw him there  That was the last they saw him  Trying to get out of his gear  Which he was having a little problem with  And somebody took their eyes off him for a little while 
[01:40:00]  And then he was gone  And they had this big long search for him  Couldn't find him  How many days went by?  Four  Four days  And they said he was a shy boy  Like he wouldn't have asked for help  But he probably couldn't get out of his gear  And he saw them leaving  And he was too embarrassed  Being a younger boy  To admit that he couldn't get out of it  A little shy kid  Yeah  And he got lost  Walked around  Apparently they found him  A few miles away from the campsite  He said he had seen people on horseback  Before they had rescued him  A couple of days earlier  And he was afraid to go up to them 
[01:40:30]  This kid's so fucking stupid  Afraid  Afraid to go up to them  Sounds like me walking to work every morning  Could be somebody wanting to help me out  And I will run away  Screaming in fear of them  Maybe the horse people were afraid  A little boy scout comes up  Which way is the campsite?  Huh?  Yeah, so they found him  Against all odds  Because when things like this happen these days  You know  Usually dead  I assume maybe an animal came 
[01:41:00]  Dragged him off or something  Or he fell  A little predator out there  Going to find his little head  With a little baseball cap on it  You know  Something horrible like that  But  Miracles  Do happen  And he was found  Among the volunteer searches  Was Kevin Bardsley  Bardsley  Bardsley  Why would they put a dash in there for me?  Whose 12 year old son Garrett  Vanished last August  While camping nearby  He was never found 
[01:41:30]  Despite a week long search  That sounds like an animal, right?  You never know  I mean out there you could fall into a gully  Or some shit  And never find you  Or into the water  Turn into bleached bones after a while  Yeah  It's awful  So that was  Yes  A friend of  One of the rescuers  What a dumb kid  Four days  You see someone on a horseback  After two days  And you're fucking  Samuel the shy sea lion  You won't wave at him  You little douchebag  Yeah  Wave, yell something 
[01:42:00]  He was dehydrated  And very hungry  They gave him some granola bars  And some water  And  Jimmy farts  And the boy asked to play a video game  On the cell phone  Of one of the volunteers  That's what he wanted to do  He's just a kid at heart  And the father grabbed his shoulders  And started shouting  Bad boy  And hitting him  Yeah, you want to smack that kid  Well we got some audio of the mother  The very relieved mother, Anthony  Yeah  Let's go to that tape right now 
[01:42:30]  People say that the heavens are closed  And God no longer answers prayers  We are here to unequivocally tell you  That the heavens are not closed  Prayers are answered  And children come home  Right  Yeah  Let's tell that to a little  Little pink cango hat girl  From Florida  Yeah, or Garrett's dad  Who went missing  And never came back  What a  You know, I understand  She's ecstatic  You know, this happened  And she got her son back  And I'm very happy for her  Very happy ending to this story  But you got to think about other things 
[01:43:00]  Besides your own joy in that situation  To say something like that  Is like saying  God cared more for my child  Than your dead one  You know  You don't think the parents  Of the Aruba girl were praying  Yeah  Yeah  No, they don't care  Please God, please God  Please God, please God  I think three or four guys  Ought to bang her and kill her  Yeah, nah  That's what I think she deserves  Sure  Do you think the father  And I wonder this  The Garrett who I'm missing  His dad kind of helped in the search 
[01:43:30]  Now when you're in that position  Because misery loves company  It's a human instinct  Like if I'm not getting something  I don't want you to get it  I don't  That's a shitty quality  But are you really rooting  For the kid to be found  Like not that you want  Why do you want misery and company  Or just like do you not want to see  That joy on another father's face  Because you'll never  I don't know  It might take a creepy question  But is there that little piece of you  Maybe there's some  In a dark corner  That kind of  Not wants the kid to not come back  But doesn't want to see  That kind of reunion  That you're not going to have  Yeah  Ooh 
[01:44:00]  Is there anything worse  If you scratch your car  I'm a terrible example  But you want somebody else  To scratch theirs  It's just you feel better  Like all right  You too  I'm not alone  You scratch your car  Hitting a child  That's killing them  That was an awful example  What a trite example I gave  Of missing children  You know when you get a hangnail  You drop your omelet  I really am a fool  I just  You know  Thanking God  I see it in sporting events  All the time  God wanted one team  To win over another 
[01:44:30]  Or  This guy to have three homers  Because  You know  Because of God  If there was a God  Do you think he'd let the Pistons win  And force what  A seventh game  Well yeah  We're going to do a seventh game  In the NBA finals  Oh boy  You think God is rooting for the Pistons  God is not rooting for the Pistons  Because God knows  That Detroit wins  That is going to be a problem in Detroit  It's going to be some burning buildings  And overturned cars  Perhaps a body count  So I've got to call Vegas  Yeah  If God is paying attention  He's going to make sure the Spurs win 
[01:45:00]  Yeah  Yeah definitely  That's right  So there you have it  God  It's a little selfish of her  To blurt that out  God heard her  Knowing there were so many children  That didn't come home  Heard her prayer  Heaven is closed  Well I guess that's what you think of  When your kid's gone four days  And he comes back  You're not thinking of  You know  The technicalities  Yeah  And other people's  Yeah  Emotions  You're just kind of happy  I mean you could say you're happy  Without saying that  You know  Children do come home  There are people sitting there  Going well  I prayed my ass off

[02:11:30]  1939  I know  My god man  39 huh  Wow  I remember when that movie  Came out  We saw it in the movie theater  With Groucho  Me Groucho  And Charlie Kaplan  I was reading something today  Oh that  About  Because Tom Cruise  And Katie Holmes  Their age difference  So they had a whole thing  Of the history of Hollywood  And age differences  And relationships  And apparently  Comics  Comic actors 
[02:12:00]  Are the ones that  Had the biggest  Distance between ages  Of husband and wife  Really funny  Yeah there were a lot of them  Like Charlie Chaplin  Really funny people  Date girls a lot younger  That's right  That's an interesting concept  Isn't that interesting  But Charlie Chaplin  Had a  Had a very young wife  And I found out  He  Charlie  Charlie Chaplin  Died the same year  Groucho did  1977  So  It would have been  Possible  To have met  Charlie Chaplin  Maybe shake his hand 
[02:12:30]  And get his autograph  And picture  Big cock  He'd be ragged on  He legendarily had  A very big mule  Yes  And we decided  That would have been  Creepier for you  Anthony  Because you know  At least Groucho  You see him talking  Charlie Chaplin  His movies  For the most part  Silent  Or silent movies  Yeah  That would be creepy  If you have a picture  Of a silent  Yep  Silent movie star  And then Tony Randall  Was married to a chick  Who was like 25 years old  When he was in his 70s  He was 75 I think  And she was 25 years old  Had two kids

[02:25:30]  He answers  Pre-screen questions  Doesn't say anything  That offensive  I don't understand it  First of all  It's not about being tough on the radio  And second of all  Not pre-screen questions  You submit what you're going to talk about  That's the standard for everyone  It's a part of what happens on television  And I did exactly what I wanted to do  I'm not sure what you mean bro  I didn't edit  I didn't do it  I'm telling you honestly  The Aussie  The Tiger Woods  The Mike Tyson  Not one of those things

[02:27:00]  The guy has talent  And should be on the tonight show  It's a whole process  That goes on  It's not live  First of all  So if Jimmy's not going to  Play by their rules  They're just not going to  Show it on TV  You know  It's not like  Maybe Jimmy or someone  From the show  Going on a live program  And deciding to  Get a little crazy  That's different  First of all  Second of all  It's what Jay Leno does  He asks the comedians  What you want to talk about  It's called a pre-interview  They do it all the time  And if you don't do it  The appearance will probably  Sound a lot like  That phone call we just got  They will just  Disjointed and stupid 
[02:27:30]  They will just cut  That part of the  You know  Appearance off  It is amazing  I got into an IM fight  With some guy  It might have been this idiot  It's amazing  It's amazing what people  It's like dude  You sold out by going  On The Tonight Show  Yeah well I agree with that  I'm like really  Yeah why not  I mean I'm like  Well what about Bill Hicks  Who always did Letterman  And Pryor  And Carlin  Those guys  He goes  Yeah well those  He would say that  They're all sellouts too  And I'm like  Well name me one comedian  That isn't a sellout  By your standards  Yeah  And he came up with  He goes  Well Patrice O'Neil  Seems pretty  I'm like what  Patrice did Comedy Central  You can't say whatever you want

[02:30:00]  Wow  It's more deadly  Than roofing  Electrical power installation  Farm work  And construction work  What are the top four?  It's got to be  Cop firemen  Yeah  It's got to be  Hmm  I can't think of the other two  Wow  I don't know  I'll have to look that up  Thank you Jimmy  Give me a little  Little mission  Little homework assignment  I'll look that up  Because if you're pizza delivery  And you're in the deadly category  You're right behind police  And firemen  And whatever the other two are  Yeah 
[02:30:30]  They say a lot of these  Oh  Robberies have forced  People to change  Their delivery policies  And they won't deliver  To certain neighborhoods  After night  Right  And now there's a problem  Of course  Because people are crying  That it's racist  It's racism  How about this  Stop fucking pulling guns  On people  When they come into the neighborhood  And we'll deliver the pizza  This is what bothers me  It's like  What is  What is just  What is real racism  And what is just  Not being a dumbass  Right  Why are cabbies racist  There's black cabbies  White cabbies  Arabic cabbies  Asian cabbies 
[02:31:00]  None of them  None of them  Want to pick up  Certain people  Who's the common denominator  And drive to certain neighborhoods  Right  It's not that they don't want  To pick up a black guy  In a suit  It's some thug  Wearing his hat sideways  You know what  I wouldn't pick him up either  Yeah  Sorry  They all know people  That have been killed  By the same people  Everyone  Screw it  And you're driving  To Brownsville  Yeah  You want to go to Brownsville  You can get robbed anywhere  Yeah you can  But why increase the odds  You can die doing anything  So why wear condoms  I mean last year  Is my philosophy  What are you getting at

[02:32:00]  Taken all these videos  And made a spoof  On America's  Funniest Home Videos  Where you put a laugh track  Behind it  And all that stuff  I'm surprised  There's not a website  That  Boing  I'm hungry  I hope someone has  Something big red and heavy  I can eat  Right  Pop  Boing  Yeah with the wacky  Voice over and stuff  Maybe we should do that  There isn't even any  That would get some  Major fucking hits  There isn't even  Getting out of the way  For that  It looks like he was  Distracting  He's talking to the other guy  And then  Guy number one  Picks up the extinguisher  He has it  And just throws it  Into his face 
[02:32:30]  And then goes and  Grabs the money  Right out of the register  In one move  Why did he just  Splash him with the  Extinguisher  That's disgusting  Fire it at him  That's not brutal enough  Disgusting  Not brutal and  Animalistic enough  Yeah  Of course not  Alright  Let's move on  That's lovely  Lovely behavior  You can see the video  For yourself  Foundrymusic.com  We should make a parody  Of America's  Funniest Home Videos  14 year old girl  By the way  Yeah  Gee  Surprising  Take a look at the picture  Who'd have guessed 
[02:33:00]  Anyone  Thoughts  Thoughts  Anyone  I don't know  There's just a severe  Problem going on  Somewhere  No one can address it  Or do anything about it  Doomed  Well  You know  Until people start  Taking responsibility  All right  Katie Carrick  Had the exclusive  Interview with the  Runaway Bride  What's her name  Again  Will  Bug Eyes  Old Bug Eyes  Will Banks  Or something like that 
[02:33:30]  Right  Jennifer Will Banks  Yes  Jennifer Will Banks  Everyone knows the story  Right  Of course  She ran away  She was scared  About getting married  And lied  And lied about  Being kidnapped  And lied about  Having some kind of  Sex with a couple  Being raped  By a Hispanic guy  And a white woman  She told a hot story  Really hot  In a van  She's tied up  The girl comes over  Starts eating her pussy  And then  Guy comes over  Starts having sex with her  She's tied up  A little dark  In the back of the van  And then apparently  She did meet 
[02:34:00]  A Hispanic guy  And a white woman  In Vegas  But no details out  About their relationship  Or anything they might have done  I speculate  She probably had sex with them  Made up the story  In the van  And the kidnapping  Got her  You know  Had a little fun  Before marriage  And then came back  And I guess her  And the husband-to-be  Did the interview  And they were asking him  All kinds of things  About getting married still  And do you feel like  A sap  And a sucker  And he's all for it 
[02:34:30]  Getting married  What a dummy  This is a problem  Let's go to the clips here  And ironically  You know  When I told John  I was going to run  That's what I was doing  I was running away  Because that's  That's what I've always done  That's what's comfortable to me  Oh  They have someone  With a squeegee  To mop up  After those huge eyeballs  Were spilling tears  All over the set  Got a big mop 
[02:35:00]  Mopping after every question  She goes filling up  With water  Owl head  Always runs away  From what?  Yeah  How tough  Is this lady's life?  Life seemed good  Oh  We'll find out right here  But there have been  Some tough times as well  Yes  Her parents divorced  When Jennifer was just six  Aww  Her mom remarried  From first grade  Till the end of high school  She alternated living  Each week  Between her mom  And dad 
[02:35:30]  Aww  You're the only one  Later her childhood home  Was destroyed by a tornado  But through it all  Jennifer says her love  For her family  Stayed in touch  I still kiss my dad  On the lips  You know  Every phone call  We end with  I love you  I had a great life  Katie  My parents  Fortunately were able  To provide for me  And my brother  I grew up in an honest home  We went to church  We had our faith  Yeah  He kisses her on the lips  I like this guy  And then in the tornado 
[02:36:00]  It was tragic  She pulled through  Two bowling balls  Actually hit her  Right in the eyeballs  And stuck in her head  And she lives with them  They are today  My dad still kisses me  On the lips  On the lips  We still  I still love you  And he whispers  Bug eyed whore  While he mounts me  Oh  They keep showing  This fire extinguisher clip  Over and over  And you know  People just look at this  And just are repulsed  By the brutality of it  I know  The nerve of that  White racist  To get his face 
[02:36:30]  While a black man  Is honestly trying  To throw a fire extinguisher  How dare he  Put his racist face  Up there  That oppressive white man  And his mutton chops  Interfere with his  Fire extinguisher  Throwing  That black man  Was trying to do  Something productive  And toss that  Fire extinguisher  Out of the way  Of other black people  Walking  And the white man  Got in the way  Got his ugly face  In the way  She dropped out of college  After two years  And came home  To take a medical 
[02:37:00]  Assistance position  In a Gainesville hospital  In the labor  And delivery unit  Oh I loved it  I used to  Kid around  Joke around  And tell everybody  That I better  Check my bags  Before I leave  To make sure  I didn't have  Any of the babies  With me  Oh no  What is she crazy  Yes she is  What a  You don't want to  You don't want to  Say things  In an interview like this  When people are looking  At you like  You're a raving lunatic  What kind of bags  Ziplop kind  Ziplop  Ziplop  You said

[02:38:30]  Why did they  Break off the  Ingrid  Yeah  What happened there  Katie Quirk blows  It's all this  Softball crap  Oh it's awful  That they promise  These people  Look you come  On our program  We promise  In our in depth  Exclusive interview  With Bug Eye  A $37 bet  From Walmart  Later that year  $1740 worth  Of merchandise  From a shopping mall  In April of 98  Charged with taking  $98 worth  Of merchandise 
[02:39:00]  From still  Another store  I know  That time  You spent  Two weekends  In jail  Right  They often say  Jennifer  And I'm sure  You both know this  That this kind  Of behavior  Or committing  This kind of crime  Isn't about  The stuff  Cry for help  Right  Cry for help  Was that a cry  For help  And was anyone  Listening  Maybe it was  A cry for help  But no one  Was listening  Your mom and dad 
[02:39:30]  Knew  Right  That you had  Shoplifted  Oh yes  I mean after  The fact  Yes  But did they say  Honey you need  To get some help  For what's going  On here  Or did they just  Sort of brush it  Under the carpet  In a way too  Look into my eyes  Oh my god  Nothing was  Accomplished  She is the worst  Interviewer  What was accomplished  There  She's leading  The witness  So this girl  Go yes  They brushed it  Under the carpet  She shoplifted  A lot  Was it a cry 
[02:40:00]  For help  You know  They say  It's not about  The stuff  Whenever I  Stall stuff  From stores  It was about  The stuff  Absolutely  Of course  I wanted a new  Pair of sneakers  I walked into  Models  Took my sneakers  Off  Put new ones  On  And walked  Right out  Because I knew  The old security  Guard at the door  Wasn't going to  Catch me  With new sneakers  On  That's right  They didn't have  All those things  They now  Put a cry  For help  Why do you think  They have all those  Hidden things  And products  Because every single  Person listening  To this program  Right now  Has shoplifted  In their life  It's not always  A cry for help 
[02:40:30]  Sometimes you just  Want something  You don't have  The money for it  Or don't want  To spend the money  On it  And it's easy  To steal  So you steal it  Yeah  I was stealing  Playboy magazines  At 12, 13  Why not  How am I going to  Explain that  To the clerk  Behind the counter  That's a tough steal  Because it's not only  It's double the  Embarrassment  If you get caught  You got caught stealing  And you got caught  Stealing Playboy  So they're going to  Be like  Ah look at this kid  Me and my brother  Got caught at the  Corner stationery store  When we were kids  Stealing candy  Went to the candy thing  And we're looking  At the register 
[02:41:00]  And it must have  Been so obvious  Because there we are  Like being all  Trying to be secretive  And just stuffing  Our pockets  So they were like  Big bulging pockets  And then we just  Like fast walk out  And he goes  Hey hey hey hey  And we stopped  And there he is  Digging his big  Meaty hands  Through our little  Boy pockets  Quite a thrill  I used to steal  Pulling all the candy  Out  I used to steal  The peanut butter  Cookies while they  Were cooling off  In grammar school  What? 
[02:41:30]  The apple pie  On the windowsill?  Washington Drive  School  The kitchen  Oh right  The kitchen  Yeah we used to  Go into the cafeteria  Kitchen in the school  Well the cafeteria  They would have the  Cookies near the back  You know the door  Yeah  You know so  They would cool off  And they were all  On nice trays and stuff  So I would go  Outside the school  To that door  And kind of sneak in  And grab my  You know my  Peanut butter cookies  Every day  That's nice  Never got caught  I stole silver  From a company  I worked for  Used to make contacts 
[02:42:00]  For relays  They used to make  Them out of silver  Little discs of silver  Were cut off  Of these silver rods  And they went  In the machine  And these silver rods  Were about eight feet long  And they kept them  In a cage  That was locked  Or lopped  As Jimmy likes to say  And I used to  Notice you could go  Up to the cage  And pull these rods  Out of the box  Right through the cage  Or right through the  Links of the fence  But you can't  Carry out eight feet  On the eight foot  Long silver rod  So I wound it  Around my legs

[02:47:30]  I understand though  Speaking of wholesome  Mister  That you were kind of wild  When you were younger  Is this true?  Yes unfortunately  Tell me why you've gotten  That reputation  In your youth  As being a bit  Of a party animal  Why I got that reputation  Because it was true  Because you earned it  Yeah right  Because it was true  But about six years ago  That's it?  Damn I wasn't listening  She said how'd you get  The reputation  Why'd you get the reputation 
[02:48:00]  Of being crazy  Of being a wild animal  That goes well  Because it was true  Oh really?  And the reputation  Of being a party animal  And something happened  That made him go into  You know  This born again Christian  Yeah  Thing  And it's always the way  So she asks him  And he doesn't answer  And she just laughs with him  And that's it?  She's a dumb bitch  This is why she gets paid  All that money?  I'm so happy they're losing  Or they're starting to lose ground  They're just awful  They got engaged last August  Ten months after their first date  They eventually began living together 
[02:48:30]  At his place  But in stark contrast  To John's younger wilder days  They decided premarital sex  Was out of the question  Why was it important  For both of you  To remain chaste  Or to not  Pure  Have intimate relations  Sorry I feel like Dr. Ruth here  But  Oh yeah  She came  It was very important  To both of us  That happened actually  During our first conversation  She was asking me  What kind of relationship  We would have  And I said  The relationship  If you and I ever had one  Would be honoring God 
[02:49:00]  And what I mean by that  We would be pure until marriage  And if people are skeptical  John  About that  To you  What do you mean skeptical?  Most people didn't ask me that  Because they knew  How I was living my life  And how I had you  I had the interview  With Katie Carrick Anthony  The runaway bride  Talking about  Being born again Christians  I understand though  Speaking of wholesome mister  That you were kind of wild  When you were younger  Is it true?  Yes  Unfortunately  Tell me  Why you've gotten that reputation  In your youth  As being 
[02:49:30]  A bit of a party animal  Why I got that reputation?  Because it was true  Because you earned it  Yeah right  Because it was true  But about six years ago  John became a born again Christian  Damn I wasn't listening  She said  How did you get the reputation  Why did you get the reputation  Of being crazy  Of being a wild animal  Because it was true  Oh really?  And the reputation  Of being a party animal  And something happened  That made him go into  You know  This born again Christian thing  Yeah  That's always the way  So she asks him 
[02:50:00]  And he doesn't answer  And she just laughs with him  And that's it  She's a dumb bitch  This is why she gets paid  All that money  I am so happy  They're losing  Or they're starting  To lose ground  They're just awful  They got engaged  Last August  Ten months  After their first date  They eventually began  Living together  At his place  But in stark contrast  To John's younger  Wilder days  They decided  Premarital sex  Was out of the question  Why was it important  For both of you  To remain chaste  Or to not 
[02:50:30]  Have intimate relations  Sorry I feel like  Dr. Ruth here  But  It was very important  To both of us  That happened  Actually during  Our first conversation  She was asking me  What kind of relationship  We would have  And I said  The relationship  If you and I  Ever had one  Would be honoring God  And what I mean by that  Is we would be pure  Until marriage  And if people are skeptical  John  About that  To you  What do you mean skeptical  Most people didn't ask me that  Because they knew  How I was living my life  And how I had changed my life  Or how God had changed my life 
[02:51:00]  And knew that that wasn't  Wasn't going to be an issue with me  Regardless of who I was with  Oh boy  I am so glad  She embarrassed this asshole  Yeah this guy  To remain pure  Until marriage  And this way  I want to live my life  And we decided  And meanwhile  Then she goes out  And comes up with this  Perverted sex story  In the back of a van  Where she's getting fucked  By some strange guy  And some girl  Is eating her  Does that speak volumes sir 
[02:51:30]  Does that tell you  That perhaps  She does not want  To remain chaste  Yeah  That she really would like  To get a bone in her  That's why she ran  Nice Mexican peeler  Slapped across her owl eyes  She's crazy  Unclipped Mexican  Adam  I'm in war helmet  Over those huge peepers  Adam in Ohio  What's up Adam  Hey guys  How's it going  Little Jimmy  What's up  Yeah  In high school  One time  I took a beer truck 
[02:52:00]  It wasn't you know  Because I was  Hungry for attention  Or I needed help  It was just because  I was really thirsty  You stole a beer truck  Yeah  Me and my brother  We just  The guy was  We lived above a bar  And the guy was delivering  And we just  Hopped in and took it  Homecoming weekend  And had a nice little party  How much beer  Did you get out of it  We had  A total  I don't know  About five  Six cases  When the cops  Showed up  There was still beer  In the truck  And of course 
[02:52:30]  I got charged  With underage consumption  And I was the oldest guy there  So I got charged  With contributing to minors  And doing all that fun stuff  Did you do any time  No no I just got kind of slapped on the wrist  And I put on probation  It was just you know  A little kid stunt  So they really couldn't do anything to me  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Watch it now boys  Thanks  Alright  When I was a teenager  I was drunk one time  We wanted some snack food  We didn't have any money  So I was so drunk 
[02:53:00]  I walked into the Crousers  And I stood on line  With like two bags  Of chips or Fritos  And then as I got  There was like a whole store  Full of people  And as I got close  To the register  I just bolted out the door  Oh  With my snack food  He is a wreck  You should have thrown  A fire extinguisher  At his face  That works  Ah  Slows him down  I was a faggity criminal  I will run with these chips  And you won't catch me  Guys  We got some white collar crime  Oh  Eric in Colorado  Morning boys  Morning Eric  Gee 
[02:53:30]  To take my cry for help  I embezzled  A hundred thousand dollars  From a bank  Okay  Really  Yeah  I was  I worked as a security guard  In a bank  And I needed some money  To pay some bills  And I embezzled  About a hundred thousand dollars  They only  True  Fifteen thousand  Of it  They could not prove  That I did the rest  Because I had hit it  I had basically  Squirreled it away  What's your last name?  Where's the money hidden?  Yeah  Where is it?  The money's gone now  I've already 
[02:54:00]  I've spent the money  I've spent it  That was  Fifteen years ago  I did  Five years  In  In a federal penitentiary  For embezzlement  Actually  They reduced the charge  Because of the  Because they can only prove  Fifteen thousand  They reduced the charge  To bank larceny  Dude  You did five years  For a hundred thousand dollars?  Fifteen thousand  Fifteen thousand  Yeah but I mean  But what you got out of it  Was one hundred thousand dollars  Yeah  You cashed in  Five years of your life  For one hundred thousand dollars 
[02:54:30]  I didn't even cash it in  What it was  Is I have a felony record  I did six months  On what they call  House arrest  I did three months  On work release  From the federal prison  And the rest of it  Was supervised probation  So I was actually  You know  For  Basically four and a half years  At the time  I was actually  Still on the street  I was able to work  Yeah  And what not  But I  Got the record for it  They could never prove  The real money  A little much  For a hundred thousand dollars  I know man  A little much 
[02:55:00]  Make that in a week  I'll tell you something  The worst part is  The way I got  The majority  Or a good portion  Of the money  The banks  The banking system  To this day  Has still not improved  That security  And a security guard  Could still do it  How's that  Why don't you say it  We're not bankers  Well  At the time  The job that I had  I helped balance  The ATM machine  So what he would do  Is take a fraction  Of each penny  That was deposited  And put it in an account  And slowly  Like Superman 
[02:55:30]  Superman 3  When somebody would  Deposit an envelope  With just cash in it  Yeah  I would just take  The envelope full of cash  Slip it down  The front of my pants  And because nobody  Was watching  What I was doing  The seller would  Hand me the envelopes  I would count the envelopes  Write the count  On the balance sheet  If there was one  That had just cash  And I'd slip it down  The front of my pants  Nobody did  I would do that  I used to deposit cash  All the time  Like that  Don't do it  Because it's the easiest  Way to get money  I was getting  There were days 
[02:56:00]  I walked out of that bank  With two, three thousand dollars  So what happens  And the person's just screwed  Yeah  Or if it was somebody  That the bank knew  Like there was one chick  That I nailed  I probably got about  Four grand  From this one woman  She was a stripper  And every couple of days  She would deposit the money  Wait a minute  If you deposit cash  In an ATM  There's a record  Of your deposit  You swipe the card  Right  You put it in  It actually  But it doesn't matter  The way it works 
[02:56:30]  Is  If there's no  Just because you put  The deposit there  I mean you could deposit  An empty envelope  Sure  Yeah but where's that  Empty envelope then  In the  Because it records  Every envelope  That's being sucked into it  Right  And they never  Were able to prove  The only  They could not prove  The money I got  From the ATM machine  The only thing  That I screwed up on  Was I actually took  A bundle of $5,000  Out of the vault  I did it three times  And that's when they caught me 
[02:57:00]  Oh so you never got  Called for the ATM stuff  Oh  How'd they catch you  In the vault  A year and a half  Because they had  Already balanced the vault  Excuse me  They had already balanced  The vault  And I had access  I had a key to the vault  And I happened to walk  In there one day  And here was about  Oh $75,000  $80,000  Laying out  No cameras in the vault  Nope  Not back then  And I grabbed  I grabbed  I just grabbed a bundle  Of $5,000 and $100  Flipped it into my pocket  Walked out  Closed the door to the vault 
[02:57:30]  And they never figured it out  Until about a week and a half later  When all of the money  Had gotten transferred  To the main branch  Downtown  And they were counting it  And they said  Wait a minute  There's $15,000 missing  And when they started  Investigating it  There was  They looked at all the people  Who had keys to the vault  And there were six of us  And it came down to me  And this one chick  I remember  And then the guy got caught  Because he had bought  A Cadillac  And then another guy  Had bought a fur coat 
[02:58:00]  Yep  She said  I told you not to do anything  My wife loves this bank vault  What's the matter with you?  The only reason  What's the matter with you?  The only reason  I got caught  Is I slipped up  And all the money  I had been taking  I was not putting  In bank accounts  I was just  You know  Hiding it someplace  Where nobody would find it  Only I knew about  And I screwed up  And part of the five grand  I used to pay a bill with  Oops  And that's how they caught me  What are you doing?  They can only prove it  Only prove 15  What do you do now, Eric? 
[02:58:30]  I'm a long haul truck driver  And here's the worst part  About security  In the United States  I have full  Custom security access  To various ports  Across the United States  The company that I work for  We haul military freight  And he's a convicted felon  There you go  Does that tell you  How great our security is?  Ouch  You know  I mean  But of course  My company  My employer  And I've talked about this  And they have just  Absolute and complete faith in me  Because they know  That I would never do it again 
[02:59:00]  Because if something  Ever happens  Any load I'm hauling  Or anything like that  Even the slightest thing  Threats missing  I'm the first suspect  Well, yeah  You know  I mean  They just  They don't worry about it  You know  I mean  Even when I got my customs clearance  They were like  They looked at the record  And they said  You do realize anything  And you're the first suspect  And I'm like  I'm the last person  You've got to worry about  Because I do not want  To go back to prison  I've got too much  Other things in my life  Worthwhile now  Wow  Very interesting  Yeah  But still 
[02:59:30]  I mean  If somebody works at a bank  That has that kind of access  To an ATM  I mean  If nobody's watching  It can still happen  And I know it still happens  So that stripper  They knew she made deposits  So they gave her the credit for it  Yeah  Because they looked at  Yeah  Because they went back  And looked at her transaction records  Yeah  I still don't  I've got a lot of people saying  They don't get the ATM scam  Because I  It's so  There's such records being kept  Of every envelope that goes in there  The records  The record keeping is better  Now  I mean  You've got to remember  This was in 1990 
[03:00:00]  The record keeping now  Is better than it was  But I have  An acquaintance  Who is a security guard  In a bank now  And he says  They could still do it  He says  Because  If you can take  And deposit  He explained to me  How he  He tried it once  And got away with it  I can't see how it is  You swipe your card  You push in  Deposit  You take the envelope  Put it in  It puts it  It's all stacked up  In order  Right  And it shows  There's a record  Of every envelope  That's in there  What was deposited 
[03:00:30]  And who deposited  So if you take one out  What I would do  Is that she would  Hand me the envelopes  All she would do  Is take the envelopes  Out of the deposit  She would hand them to me  Yeah  I would count them  If there was one  That had cash  I could tell it had cash  I would just grab it  Slip it down the front  Yeah but now it's not  Now it's not  It's not the same  As the record  Because at that time  You could fake a deposit  You could take and say  Well I deposited  You could hand them  A receipt  Are you trying to say 
[03:01:00]  That you got away with it  Because people weren't  Checking their bank statements  Maybe  So like you're  You're Anthony  And you just deposit  $100, $200  What have you  You take that envelope  With the $200  Anthony assumes  It's in there  And doesn't really check  In detail  His bank statement  That's how I could  See where you would  Get away with it  But the other way  You're the guy  In charge of the envelopes  And like Anthony's saying  There would be a problem  If they're checking  Every envelope  Like this woman  And it was actually  Because of her  That they caught it  And she came in there  And she had all  These deposit receipts  And she said  Look I do this 
[03:01:30]  Every couple of days  And these  Like three or four  Are missing  And they went back  And looked  And they said  Oh sure  How do we know  You're not just faking it  And she said  Look I do this  Every day  They went  Or every couple of days  They went back  And researched it  And they said  You know you're right  And then they started  Looking into it  But they could never  Figure out where  The envelopes went  And they  This is why  Even at my trial  The prosecuting  Or the  The U.S. Attorney's Office  They told me 
[03:02:00]  And my attorney  They said  We suspect  You are responsible  For the rest of this  But we can't prove it  Because they could never  Prove where the money went  I mean all this other  Money that was missing  They checked me out  So thoroughly  Everything I did  I mean they executed  Four different search warrants  On my parents house  Because I was living  At home at the time  And they could never  Find that damn thing  I believe the guy  Stolen  Where did you hide it?  What kind of place?  I had access to 
[03:02:30]  A friend's storage unit  And I would put  The money in there  And nobody knew  I had access to  A storage unit  Why did you just  Put it in the bank?  Because then I would  Have gotten caught  For the whole amount  I was smart enough  To realize  That the time  That if I put  Any of the money  In a bank account  They would catch it  But what I was doing  I was kidding  I would hide the money  Alright hold on  Todd the trucker  Wants in badly  Go ahead Todd  Hey I just called  To tell y'all  That most truck drivers  Are full of shit  And this guy's story 
[03:03:00]  Is so bullshit  It's pitiful  Is it?  Boy I will fax you  My criminal record  And it's you  This is something  This guy has so much  Time to think  That he just  Concocted this story  And it's calling y'all  Just because he's got  Nothing better to do  We're all full of shit  That's why we drive drugs  We can't make it  Since that  Hey boys  I'd be more than happy  To fax you  Alright Todd  Hey Todd  Why do you think  He's full of shit  Did he say something  That threw you off?  I might have lost him  Todd  Yeah we lost him 
[03:03:30]  Hey I'm more than happy  To fax you  Copy the record  No I believe you  Some guy's telling me  To shut the fuck up  And let him explain  We did  Dude the guy's been  Talking for ten fucking minutes  Explaining the Gregster  From North Carolina  You fucking cunt  Shut up  I let him talk  Stop talking  It's losing his mind  I hate these people  Alright so explain  Explain where you hit it  Well I  I definitely think  That the apocalypse  Now should have been  Higher on that movie list  Alright pal 
[03:04:00]  Alright  We're done  We're done with you  Thank you sir  There he goes  I did shut up  And let him explain  I was then  Trying to get  A little more information  On how he would do it  Because  The fact of the matter is  When you put that in there  It's not just the guard's word for it  As he's counting the envelopes  That that's how many envelopes  There are  It's got to jive with the machine  The machine keeps tabs  On how many envelopes  Went in there  If the machine says twenty  And he comes up  With eighteen envelopes  They're going to ask him  Where are the two envelopes  You're the guy counting it  The machine says there was twenty 
[03:04:30]  What happened  That's what he didn't explain  Unless he put blank envelopes in there  Or just put the envelopes back in  With no money in them  Yeah  I don't know  Or just seal the envelope  Yeah you kind of seal it up  It would look like it's taken out  It just seems like it's  Somebody really would have to  Screw up at the bank  In order for him to do this  I agree  It's not like he's like  Doing this brilliant crime  It looks like somebody  Really dropped the ball  And then  Someone here is saying the obvious  What's your name bro?  Joe  What's your name?  Your name's not on the screen  I don't know who you are  Trucker Ty 
[03:05:00]  Hey Frank  Alright Bill go ahead  Oh this is a different guy  Oh  What's your name?  What's your name?  Paul go ahead  What's your name?  Buddy  You  I'm talking to you  Hello  Yeah  What's your name?  Joe Ty  Alright Joe  What's on your mind?  Joe  Joe Ty  What's going on man?  Alright man  Hey  I'm a trucker man  I'm telling you  That guy's full of shit  You can't get a security clearance 
[03:05:30]  With a felony on your record  That's what I'm thinking too  Yeah  That's another thing  It doesn't happen  Because my co-driver here  He's ex-military  They re-shirt your asshole  With a fine tooth comb  It's not going to happen  He's full of shit  Punch it out man  Wait put him on the phone  Put your co-writer  On the phone  We're moving on  Alright  We're in a holding pattern here  Let's go to another clip here  Anthony  Runaway Bride  With Katie Couric  More babble about nothing  You know  My dad and I  I remember  My dad and I  Were joking about  Walking down the aisle together 
[03:06:00]  And not tripping  You know  Not tripping one another  And so you know  During those moments  It would just  Ease the  Take the edge  Off the pressure  A little bit  Or not the  The pressure  That I was feeling  Internally  Not pressure  From the wedding  Pressure to run  Right  So you know  It kind of pacified me  For the moment  You know  Temporarily  Jennifer says  She handled things  The way she always did  She kept them inside  Did you ever talk 
[03:06:30]  To anyone Jennifer  About how you were feeling  It sounds as if  You've got great friends  And a loving family  I'm very lucky  I have wonderful friends  And a wonderful family  But you know  What I want to say  To those people  Is it's not their fault  I wouldn't have come to you  Under any circumstances  No matter what  Hmm  Oh my gosh  Here we go over  The rest of these clips  I want to know  If her and her father  Would joke  About her being 
[03:07:00]  Banged by a Mexican  In the back of a van  Yeah  That would make some  Some funny conversation  Between father and daughter  Some real cannon fodder  For laughs  You and Pop  Katie asks  A very deep question here  Wasn't it selfish?  Ah  At any point in time  Did you think  My family is sick  Sick with worry  My fiance  Is probably so undone  By this  I think some people 
[03:07:30]  Feel that this was  Extraordinarily selfish of you  To not consider  How devastating  This was  To put your poor mom  And dad  And step parents  Through this  Did that  Enter your mind  At any point?  Not before I left  I didn't think about  What it would do  To other people  Did you try not  To think about them?  I tried not to 
[03:08:00]  But only because  I didn't care  It's just  That's my way  That's my way?  What do you mean  I was running  From that  I mean  I knew  That I had hurt them  So I just  Pushed it down  Try  You know  Try not to think  About it  And I know  That sounds so harsh  Did you hear  What Katie Cork did  This  Fucking  Some people  People are saying  That it's selfish  Can you have  The fucking balls  To just go  Look  That seemed  Really selfish 
[03:08:30]  That's selfish  People say  Not me  I'm  Sitting here  Not judging you  15 or 18  Second question  Yeah  And they have to  Like put words  Around it  To hide  What she's really  Saying  Right  Hey look  You had a lot  Of people worried  Don't you think  That was really selfish  There you go  End of question  Yeah  Holy shit  You know  I mean  There were a lot  Of people concerned  I mean  Didn't  A lot of people  Might say that  Was selfish  Did you ever  Shut the fuck up  God you're awful  You dress horrible  And your questions  Are awful  You get to the bottom 
[03:09:00]  Of nothing  I know nothing  More about this case  No  Nothing  I guessed this  Yeah  She's selfish  Let's get to  Hopefully some better clips  This one's about  How she made up  The rape story  Back in Georgia  At first  There was jubilation  She had been the victim  Of a kidnapping  But released  Alive  By then though  Jennifer had told police  Even more disturbing details  She had been forced  Into a blue van  And raped  A heartbreaking story 
[03:09:30]  But not a word  Of it  Was true  At Albuquerque  Police headquarters  Her story collapsed  I think that  It just sort of clicked  With me  And it clicked  With them  That I wasn't  Telling the truth  I got really scared  I knew that  I couldn't keep that up  I thought  There's going to be  This manhunt  Out there  For these people  And you know  There's going to be  These people  That are wrongly accused  Because of me  And I felt horrible  About that  At one point  I know  One of the detectives 
[03:10:00]  Reportedly said  We can stop  Looking for the van  Right  And we said  Yes  How did you come up  With that story  Love it  How  Maybe I've watched  Too many  Cops and robbers movies  Yeah  Cops and robbers movies  Have rates like that  That it's been so easy  For me  Eat her pussy  While I rape her  And I'm trying  To figure out  Why it was so easy  For me  You dirty rat  I'm putting it 
[03:10:30]  In your dumper  Eat my ass  See  I'm going to fuck you  And you're going to  Suck Muggsy's cock  See  It's curtains for you  Curtains  I'm going to wipe  My cock on the curtains  Too many  Cops and robbers movies  She should have watched  Chevy Chase raped me  I guess I watched  Cops and robbers  Too many times  Cops and robbers movies 
[03:11:00]  What the fuck  What is she talking about  She is atrocious  She made up a story  Of a  A Puerto Rican  Threesome  In a van  I watched too many  Jimmy Cagney movies  Look ma  I got no  Fuck me  I stink  I was going to say  I got four skills  I said I got no  And there was no  Backing out of it  I have no improv skills  I'm sorry 
[03:11:30]  I have a rough one Jimmy  I'm just tired  Hop in a bug eyed  Bitch's pussy ma  Here's another great clip  They had been reunited  A few days after  She got home  And I wanted to say  So much  But I couldn't say  Anything at all  I don't think I did  Say anything to him  We just hugged  One another  I was crying  He said are you okay  We prayed  No but I will be  No man 
[03:12:00]  I'm pretty fucking  Fox  I'm okay  No but I will be  First of all  No one else needs to know  About this  Tells her a little story  Of the gimp  He was raped  He had a ball in his mouth  I will kill you  Mother  Cops and robbers  Cops and robbers movies  She's awful  I guess the question  Everyone wants to know  The answer to  Is a very simple one 
[03:12:30]  Why?  Why?  Wow  Honestly  I wish I could give you  And everybody else  That answer  Because I know  That they want  To hear that  And they deserve  To hear that  I don't know  Well bug eye  I'll put your words  Up here for everyone  To see  I don't know  The question  That so many people  Want the answer to  How about this  Fucking reporter  Yeah  Why'd you do it?  Why'd you do it?  Stop softening  And trying to soothe 
[03:13:00]  Everybody  Not me  I'm just  I'm sitting here  And  Not me  But the people  They all want to know  Yeah  Why'd you do it?  Why'd you do this?  I don't know  She does know  She's still a lying  Sack of shit  I swear to god  I hope this bitch  Goes to jail  Especially for lying  To cops on a police report  No I think it's  Not going to happen  No it won't happen  They said she's got to  Pay $15,000  Something like that  For the search charges  And meanwhile  She's getting half a mil  For a movie deal  How 
[03:13:30]  By the way  Isn't there some kind  Of a law  Against profiting from a crime?  Can she not be charged  Of a crime?  How is she getting paid  For this shit?  That's true  Because it's not really  Being charged for a crime  I don't care that the news  Picked that bond  That's the news's problem  But she lies to the cops  Files a false police report  And she's getting  A half million dollars  This country stinks  There it is  Black people do have a point  When they bitch  Look  This fucking Aruba chick  It's horrible  And I feel terrible  She's on the news  Every day  Because she's a pretty  White blonde chick  This chick does this 
[03:14:00]  And the whole country  Is concerned  Where is she?  Now she's a victim  Criminal bitch  Because they thought  She was pretty  Because they had  An old photo of her  Before she got all  Black eyed  You know two  Black guys  Teens  Were shot dead  In St. Thomas  I think it was  Maybe  Island might be wrong  Same area  A couple of  About a week ago  A week and a half ago  And they're trying  To find the killers  But no sign  No one really cares 
[03:14:30]  Keith Robinson  Had a really funny joke  About when Jessica Lynch  Was in Iraq  And she was missing  And everything  And how she just  Fucking booted Shoshana  What was the girl's name  The black  Private  The black girl  Yeah  Yeah  I can't remember  The name of her  Just kicked her  I want to say  Shoshana Johnson  Someone else might know  Just kicked her  Out of the fucking news  Oh totally  Totally  God damn it  There's a point to that  You just  You know what it is though  It's just  It's demographics  Yeah  You gotta look  The majority of this country  Is white people  Still is  Maybe that'll change 
[03:15:00]  In the future  So when  Maybe  Human beings are  You want  You're more concerned  With people that are  More like you  Than you are  With people that aren't  It's basic human nature  Blonde hair and blue eyes  Right  That's right  Why can't we  I'm a girl  And that's why  It gets more attention  And I know  I know the humanistic  Part of it  But the news  Again  I'll agree with you  But let's go  Let's say  Stop putting that  Fucking asterisk  Like you're unbiased  And you're just  Reporting things 
[03:15:30]  As they are  Yeah  You know  You're not doing that  You can't it both ways  You know  Because it's going to create  You know  They're trying to do  This whole thing  And it's going to create  A mongrel  Class of people  Malada  Malada  Malada  Ask them if they want to help  Save this country  From the onslaught  Of integration  You know  The system is  They want to throw  White children  And colored children  Into the building  Part of integration  Throughout of which 
[03:16:00]  Will come a conglomerated  Malada  Mongrel  Class of people  All races  Will be destroyed  In such a moment  I for one  Mongrel  After God  Will die  Before I yield  One inch  Oh  Maybe I should be  Sorry  I got caught up in it  And he's a really  Old man too  Yeah  He's a really  An older gentleman  Oh he probably  Remembers the days  You know  I could have had you  Sheld  Well this is from the 60s 
[03:16:30]  That was from Mississippi  Byrne  That's 1960s  Klan footage  Yep  Alright let's go to Gary  Gary what's up  Hey just two clips ago  I can't believe you guys  Let this go  Didn't you hear  She said that they just  Sat and hoed each other  And  They didn't  They didn't hold each other  They sat and hoed them  Oh I didn't catch it  Thank you for pointing that out sir  Yeah alright  Let's go back to the clip here  Well you must be a fun guy  To watch TV with  You catch everything  And this is the part  That a lot of people  Don't know  I had a bottle of pills  Or I had the bus ticket 
[03:17:00]  And I decided  And I decided not to play God  That day  And decide  When it was time  For me to go  So I got on that bus  Were there other alternatives?  Sure there were  But that's all I knew  At that moment Katie  You know  And  I'm so ashamed  And feel so guilty  For the people  That I've hurt  And how 
[03:17:30]  You know  How this has affected  Many people's lives  But  At the same time  It's the best mistake  I ever made  It allowed me to realize  That I desperately needed help  And that's what I did  And that's what I'm getting now  You say you had a bottle of pills  Were you seriously  Considering suicide?  But I'm saying  Katie doesn't  Because I thought  She had full stone chewables 
[03:18:00]  Katie gets right to the meat of it  That's a hell of a follow up there Katie  Want to make sure  Everyone knows  The people here watching know  Suicide  What do you think  She was going to do  With the pills?  Birth control  So the Mexicans  Didn't knock her up?  Have a little mud baby  I didn't want a little  Conglomerated  Malata  Malata  Mongrel baby 
[03:18:30]  Clearly  These demons don't  Kind of show up overnight  Exactly  How long  Have you been  Wrestling  With this?  This is the sad part about it  For me  Since birth  Have you told me  Suppression  Or panic disorder  Or anxiety  I would do that  Have they  So they diagnosed you  With anything specifically 
[03:19:00]  Or  No  We're not supposed to put labels on it  Yeah so that means no  They didn't diagnose her  With anything  She's a selfish  Moron  Is what she is  And what  The pills  And the bus ticket  And I had a choice  She still never says  What the pressures were  And why she ran  She said it wasn't the wedding  She said it was not the pressure  Of the wedding  What's 
[03:19:30]  What was the problem  Katie really got to the bottom  Of that  Just look at her and go  What were the issues  That made you run  I don't know  I don't  What made you run  She's not being honest  In this interview  And Katie stinks  Katie is an atrocious  No answer getting  Fucking over the hill  Not cute anymore  Bitch  And I make  She makes me  Physically ill  She stinks  And I don't like her  Last clip  Thank God  What do you say  To the angry people  Some people are 
[03:20:00]  Furious  Some people  About  That's that trick  That we told everybody about  Fox News  People are saying  Fox News does it  CNN  All these talk shows  Some people are saying  Some people are very angry  Right  Some people  Some people  Some people think I dress  Like a fucking  A little sailor  Her outfits  Really  I'm not a gay man  I shouldn't notice  In this clothing  But that's how bad  Her outfits are  Yeah  That even heterosexual  Men notice  Fat hips  Some people are saying  I have fat hips 
[03:20:30]  What do you think of that  Some people are  Furious  About this  Livid  That  You concocted this story  That you misled  Your family  And friends  And the general public  What would you say  To those people  Right now  Who are watching this  And are still  Hopping mad  Pardon my French  But you're an asshole  Now tell them  Please be patient 
[03:21:00]  I've got to  First of all  Learn to be happy  With myself  So that I can have  Confidence that others  Will be happy with me  What  And  That's a work in progress  Where did this  On clip 16  That we just played  Where did it start  What was the time  Code where it started  Oh it's like  42 seconds  I don't know  How long  I think her question  Was over 20 seconds  Yeah  I think that  Fucking middle age 
[03:21:30]  Fat hip abomination  Took over 20 seconds  To say  What do you say  To people  That are furious  At this  Yeah  Yeah  She is terrible  You know what I want  To do to her  I want to hold her down  And I want to  Bite her hips  Where they're fat  Through her awful  Mom dress  She's got that  Secretary spread going  I'm sure all the people  In the hallway  Are going  Way to go Katie  Yeah  Hold run Katie  You did a bang up job  On this

[03:22:30]  Yeah  She obviously has  A vag  That is to die for  Right  Amazing  But you wouldn't  Know it from  Reading the inside  Of Playboy  No  Nothing that resembles  A pussy  In her nude photos  Stop it  Nothing  It's a bunch  Of breast shots  This magazine  It's fucking  Not 1940  But they do have  A spread called  Men in Blanco  Which is six pages  Of men  Wearing white  Suit jackets  This magazine  Is shit  Men in Blanco 
[03:23:00]  The problem is  They get some  Of these celebrities  That don't want  To go all the way  With their nudity  That still doesn't  Explain men  In Blanco  Exactly  How about this  You don't want  To go all the  In nudity  You don't get  A million dollars  Whore  That's a little  Fashion article  Men in Blanco  I don't want to  See that unless  Blanco is an  Eighteen year old  Girl from Mexico  Exactly  Men in Blanco  That's all I want  To see  Why do they have  To show  And look  This is what  Makes me so sick 
[03:23:30]  About Playboy  They show  This fat  Knuckle  And when you  Open the front  Page  They have the  Contents  Cover story  The part of the  Photo they show  In cover story  Look at that  The bottom of the  Bikini  Where that little  Bulging knuckle  Is winking  It tasks me  Look at it  It looks like  It looks like  If you turn it  Sideways  It looks like  Hitchcock's  Profile  In her  Bikini bottoms  How wonderful  Is that  Yeah  They focus on that 
[03:24:00]  Because they know  It's a point of  Interest  And you're not  Getting any  When you go  You wouldn't  Know she had  She could be  A tranny  From your lips  To God's ears  In this  Thing  And you wouldn't  Know it  Because nothing  That resembles a  Pussy is being  Shown  Cowboy blows  I gotta go to  The phones  You know  We gotta take  Our meeting  Today  Ryan go ahead  Hey  I just cannot  Believe that you  Give that fucking  Whore any airtime  The way that she's  Playing herself as  The victim  Please  Yeah but we are  Kind of giving her 
[03:24:30]  A beating though  We're not agreeing  With it  We're kind of  Smashing her  Yeah we had a  Couple good smash  Fests here  But it was a  Big news story  Huge news story  We thought that  Katie would actually  Get to something  Nothing was  Accomplished  But there's nothing  That Katie Couric  Had to offer  Nothing  She's a shallow  Whore  Dude did you hear  Katie got to the  Bottom of some  Things  Some people are  Saying things  And Katie did  Kind of ask that  All we learned  Throughout her whole life  She's had a tough time  Talking to people  About her problems  The problems that she has  We don't know  She's never been diagnosed  Thank you very much 
[03:25:00]  That's it  I just  I don't get it  She has nothing to offer  Why is she paraded  Across the media  There's nothing  Nothing there  She is terrible  Americans are  Enamored  By that  Dumb  Whore  Not as much  These days  My friend  My  My girlfriend  Diane Sawyer  Is starting to kick  Katie's ass  I don't know  How you look at her  As an attractive woman  I don't know  What it is either  I don't know  Diane Sawyer 
[03:25:30]  Drop to a knee  And just punch her  In her fucking  There are times  Wow  There are times  Diane Sawyer  She just comes on  That screen  All motherly  And kind of hot  Motherly and hot  Never  Ever  Ever  Go together  Ever  Ever  And I stand there  In the office  And I just kind of  Look at the TV  And just get a nice  Warm feeling  You want to nuzzle  In her bosom  You ever pinch your helmet  Through your sweat  Looking at Cokie Roberts  I just want to take 
[03:26:00]  Your sweet little head  And just rest it  Against her supple bosom  I never had an older  Woman fetish  Even when I was nine  I liked them younger  Oh yeah  Never like  I don't know what it is  With Diane Sawyer  But I'll take a little  Look every morning  See what Diane's wearing  Anything that resembles  Mommy  Nothing  I want nothing  Sexual to do with  I never  I think she's an animal  In bed as well  She might be  I think that this whole  Persona she shows  On TV being overly nice  And sweet  And not offending anyone 
[03:26:30]  I think it's a much  Different scene in the bedroom  Knuckle  Uh no  You know what scene  Like was disgusting to me  Remember in Animal House  When he took Dean Wormer's  Wife up into his room  Oh yeah  And she had the stockings  On and everything  I was just looking  Going oh  With the pointy tits  Right  And the old woman  Tit bra  And I'm watching that  Like oh  The old woman cologne  Yeah  I wanted the other scene  I like the other scene  With the  The guy that was  With the  Yeah  With the girl from  The grocery store 
[03:27:00]  Nothing for me today  Thank you  Sometimes  The only time an old woman  Is sexy to me  I mean some of them  Are really hot  But situationally  Like again  That was the Dean's wife  Yeah  Something like that  Can be hot  Because it's so dirty  And inappropriate  But just like  Like a Diane Sawyer  I wish it did  It's like a big fetish  But nothing  Yeah  The little girl in Animal House  What other role did she play  She was in Caddyshack  Very good  As Lacey Underwell  Well thanks for nothing  No  The Scottish  Played the one with the filthy feet  Oh she had a huge career  And the big muff in the panties 
[03:27:30]  Yeah the Scottish chick  Huge career  I worked at Halfway House  On the course  Yeah  Yeah  Same chick  I have to tinkle  I'm back  Oh  Going already  I can't wait  Oh you little bladder  We don't have to break  No we've been talking for an hour  As we go  Let's pet him real hard  And scratch his back  So he pees on the floor  Gets all excited  He just gets excited  As we go to break  Scoot on the rug  It's Leno  Yeah  We go to the monologues  Every once in a while  When there's a big news story 
[03:28:00]  And we were talking about  Saddam Hussein  Loving the Doritos  And all that yesterday  And hating the Froot Loops  And well Jay Leno  Did a great job  On his monologue  As far as that is concerned  We'll go to that  As we go to break  What Jimmy  What'd Letterman do  A couple of mustache jokes  Well  If you could wait  Just one more minute  We'll do the  Oh you're doing a comparison  Well I wasn't even  Going to play Letterman  Because now I'm with you  I'm digging the Jay Leno  But here's Letterman first  Alright  Alright  Here's another way  You can tell that it's summer  Saddam Hussein has switched  To cool ranch Doritos 
[03:28:30]  So that's good  You see that in the paper  Apparently while he's in prison  Saddam Hussein says  That he loves Doritos  Boy I'm telling you  You can't buy publicity  Like that  Can you  You can't  I mean  Honestly if you have  A snack food company  You want that endorsement  From the butcher of Baghdad  But apparently 
[03:29:00]  They say that Saddam Hussein  Got hooked on Doritos  At Chemical Ali's  Superbowl party  That's what happened  Really funny  Really funny  Also  Saddam Hussein told his guards  That he misses Ronald Reagan  That he doesn't like George W. Bush  And he misses Ronald Reagan  Well good news Saddam  You'll be seeing him soon  What do you think 
[03:29:30]  That's not bad  I mean  Again I'm not a huge fan  But the line about  The Chemical Ali's  Superbowl party  Is hilarious  That's funny  You're biased though  But I recognize  That Leonard is funny  I don't think he stinks  I just don't like  The way he doesn't  Go after certain things  By the way  Diane Sawyer  Is 60 years old  She is not  Is she really  Born in 1945  I can't fake that  Are you serious  That's what I  She'd smell like  That perfume  That old ladies wear  That when they leave the room  Eight minutes later 
[03:30:00]  It's still there  Yeah  That awful  And it just sounds  Like the clank  Of charm bracelets  You know the old lady  Charm bracelets  With the little heads on it  The grandkids on it  Yeah  You like that  Not that she's 60  That's for sure  They make her look younger  On TV  She's 30 years older than you  What are you going to do with this  I don't want people  To know I'm 30 dude  Relax  Nuzzle her bosom  Yeah  You're in it there 
[03:30:30]  Alright  Here's Leno  Doing some jokes about Saddam  And according to an interview  In GQ magazine  Saddam Hussein says  He wishes to be friends  With President Bush  Isn't that ironic  The one foreign leader  Who reaches out to President Bush  And it's Saddam Hussein  The one ally we have  Oh  What are the odds  One guy  Hey did you see this on the news 
[03:31:00]  They showed these two soldiers  That were guarding Saddam  When they were over there in Iraq  And they said  Saddam gave them advice  On how to seduce women  They spent a lot of time  With Saddam Hussein  And he gave them advice  On how to get women  And I guess Saddam has released  A DVD with some of his advice  Well show a clip  From Saddam's new DVD  Oops  Gas her with some chemical weapons  Kidnap her family  Torture her  Let her know who's the boss  So far Letterman's winning 
[03:31:30]  Although I do like the time  That he mentioned gas  Gas and torture  I respect that  And according to the same GQ article  Saddam Hussein says  He is 100% certain  That he will one day  Return to power  You know  Kind of like the Clintons  You know  Same  Ha ha  Gotta give it to Letterman  Yeah  On this subject  Well Letterman had  One really great joke  And um  I just like the fact 
[03:32:00]  That Letterman mentioned  The torture  That's nice  Who decided to keep  The visual in there  Yeah  Whose call is that hawk  Let's get to the bottom  I'm just right now  On the air  Alright Derek  Get us out of here  Look at my high boobies  When you talk to me buddy  I'm in the mood for bosom  The Opie and Anthony show  Brings you the greatest  Radio promotion  Ever invented  Wow  Whip them out Wednesday  Let me see those  Let me  Get your official  Opie and Anthony  Wow bumper sticker  Just fill out the form  On opieandanthony.com  Or send a self-addressed  Stamped envelope  To the Opie and Anthony show
