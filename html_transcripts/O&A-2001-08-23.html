<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment inspired by a radio trade magazine's "Best Bits of the Month."  The hosts attempted several bits, including "Drive-By Joking," where their intern, "Spaz," delivered dirty jokes on the street near the David Letterman studio, resulting in his dismissal from the area.  The "Half-Minute Run" and "Shut-the-Hell-Up" caller games proved largely unsuccessful.  A distraught caller, Bobby, whose girlfriend left him for a mutual friend, received (often crude) commiseration and song dedications from the hosts and other callers.  Comedian Jeffrey Ross appeared as a guest, briefly discussing his career.  The segment ended with a long, awkward interview with Bob May, the actor who played the Robot in *Lost in Space*, marked by confusion over his role (he wore the suit but didn't provide the voice).

The show continued with a discussion of O.J. Simpson's alleged post-trial behavior, focusing on his relationship with Christy Brody (or Pratty), a Nicole Brown Simpson look-alike.  The hosts recounted Brody's claims of Simpson's confessions, reenactments of the murders, stalking, and attempts to erase messages, punctuated by comedic impersonations of Simpson.  They referenced a 911 call involving Brody, Simpson, and a drug dealer named Pedro Guerrero, and created a humorous fictionalized second 911 call.  This was followed by Anthony's rambling anecdotes about his stay at his ex-mother-in-law's house, detailing humorous and awkward situations involving his ex-wife and family. The segment concluded with a discussion of a Long Island day spa and allegations of sexual assault by a masseur called "Mr. Jew," including a news report, listener calls, and one host's uncomfortable experience with a male masseuse.

The next segment began with a humorous account of a humiliating vacation experience involving unwanted physical contact.  This transitioned to a studio segment featuring Wendy and her brother Jeff, who participated in a "Feels for Meals" challenge.  The hosts devised a contest where a blindfolded Jeff had to grope a topless Wendy (in a box) to win Jim Brewer concert tickets and a backstage meet-and-greet.  This caused outrage and disgust among many callers, some hanging up.  Jeff successfully identified his sister, and the hosts jokingly pushed for further physical contact.  The show then shifted to crude speculation on the New York Senate election between Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani, including a comedic fantasy involving Bill Clinton's arrest portrayed in a *Cops*-style scenario. The show ended with a call-screening segment where a caller was tricked into a fake landscaping job interview with increasingly absurd questions, concluding with a brief acknowledgement of the show's controversial nature.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You guys made me blow chucks.  Great!  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  Anthony, so let's get to the trade magazine thing.  Yes.  You want to explain what we did yesterday and what we're going to do today? 
[00:00:30]  Sort of like, you know, taking everyone behind the scenes.  Sure.  Like Rick did at Universal Studios.  What you're seeing here is a facade.  It's just the front of the building, but as we drive around back, look,  it's just popped up in some two-by-fours and other wood.  You might recognize this from the movie Spartacus.  You remember that, Rick, right?  Yes.  See?  Yes.  So what we like to do is drive the old radio tour bus,  behind some of the facades of radio, Opie. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, we like to break down that wall and explain to you what happens  with other radio shows around the country.  And yesterday we were learning all about contesting.  Yeah.  To make our contesting better on our show.  They forgot the most important rule, though, in contesting.  We read it yesterday, and I didn't see this anywhere in there.  Have a prize.  Have a prize.  That's a good one that they should learn here at N.E.W.  Any contest should have a prize. 
[00:01:30]  All right, Anthony.  So I got my hands on a radio publication.  This goes to many, many morning shows around the country  to make their morning show better.  Right.  There's a few guys in this here city of ours that do these bits.  It's a, it's a, they share.  Yeah.  So these shows in the middle of nowhere, they do a good bit on their show,  and then they type a little e-mail letter to this publication.  Guy's got a great response from this bit. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  Try it out in your city.  So they send the e-mail into the publication,  then the publication collects all the bits from all over the country.  Yeah.  And they reprint them as a feature called Best Bits of the Month, Anthony.  Yes.  And if you subscribe to this magazine that I'm holding,  you could do some of these bits at your radio station.  Right.  As they share to help each other out.  Are you ready for the Best Bits of the Month of September, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:02:30]  We start off with Drive-By Joking.  Drive-By Joking.  You send your intern out with a joke book and have him insist on reading jokes to people  waiting to cross the street or at the light.  That's a Drive-By Joking.  Yes.  And that's one of the popular things.  So we would send someone out on the street.  And made the Best Bits of the Month, yes.  With a cell phone or something, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And they insist on telling people jokes while they're waiting to cross the street. 
[00:03:00]  Would you like to try this bit today?  If it's one of the best bits of the month, sure.  Well, it would be silly not to jump all over this.  Let's see how it does in New York City.  Where's Spaz?  Let's see if Spaz is willing to do this.  Spaz, are you willing to try out one of the Best Bits of the Month?  Yes, I am.  From this fine radio publication.  It's called Drive-By Joking.  Okay.  What do I have to do?  We're going to send you out on the streets with a joke book.  You've got to walk up to people and read jokes to people as they wait to cross the street 
[00:03:30]  or a light.  Okay.  Do we have a joke book?  Yes.  We do.  What kind?  Anything good?  A dirty joke book.  A dirty joke book.  A dirty joke book.  Okay.  All right.  Go get the dirty joke book.  All right.  Hurry up and bring that back in here.  And we'll send you out to try one of the Best Bits of the Month, Spaz.  Yeah.  All right.  Very, very excited.  Also on this list of Best Bits of the Month that you can try at your radio station, at your show. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  The Half Minute Run.  The Half Minute Run.  What is this about?  Well, Anthony, it's pretty simple.  Mm-hmm.  You get two listeners on the phone, and they go back and forth answering a question with  a question for 30 seconds.  Oh, ho.  They must ask a question back and forth for the full 30 seconds.  First one to answer the question without asking another question back loses.  Ho.  And that's one of the, like, bits of the month.  Best Bits of the Month.  All right. 
[00:04:30]  You can put them in a situation like at the mall, a ball game, or wherever.  Oh, oh.  Oh, we can put them in a little situation.  And here's the joke book.  Great.  Here's the joke book.  You're at a whorehouse.  Go.  Hey, get two people on the line that want to play Half Minute Run.  But, Anthony, there's the joke book we're going to send.  All right.  We're going to send Spaz out on the streets with.  Get a sampling.  How did Yoko Ono get her name?  Oh.  When she was born, her father cried, oh, no, because he couldn't tell her face from her ass.  I'm just opening them up. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Why is Nancy Reagan like a dead camel?  Why?  They're both very dry humps.  That's so funny, I forgot to laugh.  What's the most practical gift for Imelda Marco?  A house.  What?  A shoe forest.  A shoe.  All right, Spaz.  What year did this come out?  Let me see.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Because some of these jokes are very, very dated.  Oh, 1988. 
[00:05:30]  That's good.  We have jokes.  Hey, look.  Dice's material's in here.  All right.  What do you call a female clone?  What?  A clunt.  I'm standing there.  Hey, we might have to use that.  Yeah, use that one.  Circle that one.  One good one.  A clunt.  All right.  We got a couple people that want to play the half-minute run, Anthony, as we try some of the best bits.  All right.  These are the best bits by other shows all over the country.  But why don't you give Spaz the joke book so we can try that bit out on the streets of New York. 
[00:06:00]  I'm praying that you don't get punched in the face, Spaz.  Are you ready to play the half-minute run, Anthony, with a couple of our listeners?  Let's give it a try, Opie.  These are the bits that are supposed to make your show much better.  So, well, we have nothing to lose, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's go to Mike on line three.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  You want to play the half-minute run.  That wacky game?  Yeah.  We really want you to try to play it, though. 
[00:06:30]  I'll try.  Just make believe you're calling a really, really lame morning show, and you really got to try to win the prize, okay?  Got you, buddy.  And we will give you something if you do win.  All right.  What about if I don't win?  Then you lose.  Do you know how to play the half-minute run?  Break it down for me one quick time.  All right.  You're going to be a conference with another fine listener of this radio show.  Okay.  You're going to ask them a question.  All right.  They have to, in turn, ask you a question back.  Gotcha.  The first person that answers the question from the listener loses. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And you've got to last 30 seconds.  Ant and I will give you an example.  A quick example.  All right.  How are you doing?  How am I doing?  Is it going to rain today?  Have you seen the weather?  Are you going to the Met game today?  The New York Mets?  Or are you going to the Yankee game today?  Okay.  Okay.  I don't have Down syndrome.  Down syndrome.  Shell.  This is my commercial. 
[00:07:30]  We've got to talk about that later.  This is pathetic, though.  This is one of the best bits of the month.  So let me get you with Pete here.  Hey, what's up?  Pete, do you understand the rules of the half-minute run?  Yes, I do.  All right.  All right.  Who starts this?  I guess we'll pick whoever it is.  Should we put them in an interesting situation, Opie?  Please do.  Yeah.  Let's make believe they're on a street corner in the middle of Manhattan.  All right.  You're on a street corner in the middle of New York City, everybody. 
[00:08:00]  Mike, you're going to start out by asking Pete a question.  Remember, Pete, I'll the answer with a question.  All right.  Are you guys ready?  I'm ready.  All right.  Start the clock.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's synchronize.  In three, two, one.  Pete, go.  Who goes first?  Me and Pete.  Pete.  That was a question.  I know, but Pete, go.  Hey, Mike.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  I'm over here now. 
[00:08:30]  That's not a question.  You loser, Eddie.  You suck.  But, you know, this is a great, great.  Oh, wacky.  All right.  Who lost?  Mike won.  Mike won?  All right, Mike.  Hold on a line.  We're going to give you a prize for playing.  You guys are the best.  Thank God you don't do this crap.  Thanks for playing half-minute run.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Anthony, make sure we write down that we played the half-minute run today at 4.50. 
[00:09:00]  Because then tomorrow we can play it at 6.50.  6.50.  It'll be brand new for a brand new audience.  Right.  Because not everyone gets to listen to the whole goddamn radio show.  Right.  People are doing that.  Best bits of the month.  The half-minute run.  Well, that one didn't work too well, Anthony.  No, that really sucked.  Do you want to play the shut-the-hell-up game?  Shut-the-hell-up game.  Do you want to give the rules to the shut-the-hell-up game?  Best bits of the month of September, Anthony.  Let me see the shut-the-hell-up game. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, have a contestant conference with a spouse or friend.  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says.  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut-the-hell-up!  Try to find a guy that'll call his wife or something to play.  Shut-the-hell-up.  Called, you're an effing a-hole.  The shut-the-hell-up game.  And then there's the stop-calling-me-that game, which is similar, Opie. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, what's that?  But the contestant continuously calls their spouse or friends a predetermined name.  Example, Hoochie Mama.  Imagine that.  He's on the phone with his wife, and he just keeps saying,  Okay, Hoochie Mama.  What do you want me to bring home, Hoochie Mama?  How are the kids, Hoochie Mama?  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or wife to say,  Stop calling me that.  Hoochie Mama.  Hey, can someone, I'm going to play a game.  Shoot the DJ in the head. 
[00:10:30]  If I'm playing a contest that really seems stupid,  please come on up and just shoot me in the head.  Holy smoke.  Best bits of the month of September, though.  Hold on, this guy's calling his wife to play Shut-the-hell-up.  Ah.  Tony.  I forgot how to play that one.  It's very easy.  Explain the Shut-the-hell-up game again, Anthony, to Tony.  The Shut-the-hell-up game.  Have a contestant, which would be you, too.  A conference with a spouse or a friend. 
[00:11:00]  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says.  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut-the-hell-up!  Yeah!  Shut-the-hell-up!  Ho-ho-ho!  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, do it.  You want to play it, Tony?  Yeah, I'm ready.  We're going to get that wife's number, and then we're going to play Shut-the-hell-up!  Oh, Tony.  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  Tony, it's going to ring in a second here.  Go ahead.  Hello?  Yeah.  Tom?  Yeah.  Hi.  Tom?  Hi. 
[00:11:30]  What's the matter?  Are you all right?  What's the matter?  Are you all right?  Hmm.  Why are you imitating me?  Why are you imitating me?  Where are you?  Where are you?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Your son's looking for you.  Your son's looking for you.  Are you trying to be funny?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  It's not you, obviously, that you're on the phone right now playing games. 
[00:12:00]  Not you, obviously.  You're on the phone somewhere playing games.  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  What are you doing right now?  What are you doing?  Where are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, Tony.  I couldn't have to do it.  Hey, Tony's wife on the phone.  What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne, we were playing a great groovy new game called Shut the Hell Up.  You see, your husband, Tony, has 30 seconds to repeat everything you say until you say, 
[00:12:30]  Shut the Hell Up.  We're on the radio right now.  I wasn't paying attention.  What's your name, darling?  And I didn't say Shut the Hell Up, and I always do.  What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne.  I'm sorry.  You know who.  Hey, Joanne, what's your favorite radio station?  Is this talk radio, my favorite radio station?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:13:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-w.  Well, thanks for playing the Shut Up game.  I guess we don't have a winner this afternoon.  We'll be playing this game again tomorrow.  At what time?  I think we'll play it at 345 tomorrow.  Well, no, we have Battle of the Sexes penciled it for that time.  All right there, Tony and Joanne.  Lovely couple.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And don't forget, Shut the Hell Up! 
[00:13:30]  That came blown.  Who's going to say Shut the Hell Up?  Come on, man.  That was good.  Someone might say Knock It Off, or What Are You Doing, or Shut Up.  But Shut the Hell Up.  And then what if they just say Shut Up?  Do they win?  They don't specify in this.  Well, it's one of the best bits of the month, according to this radio magazine that I got in my hands.  This is legit bits.  So bad.  All right, Spaz is ready to play the other game, Anthony.  All right, Spaz is on the phone.  He's, uh, Spaz, you've got to be our intern for this.  Spaz is going to be playing. 
[00:14:00]  This is, I'm laughing so hard I can barely say it, Opie.  This is what we call the drive-by joking.  We send our own Spaz out on the streets with a joke book.  And he is going to insist on reading jokes to people.  Waiting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Waiting to cross the street.  Hey, Spaz, are you there?  Are you ready to play?  All right, Spaz.  Yes, I am.  I'm trying to select someone right now. 
[00:14:30]  Spaz, just walk up to somebody and just start telling them a joke.  Oh, this bit is bad job.  What do you call a female clone?  A clunt.  Oh, ho.  What's she doing, Spaz?  What's she doing?  She's ignoring me.  What do most male representatives believe is the most sensible position for a female to start in?  Clone.  Oh, ho.  Spaz, what's she doing now?  She's ignoring me still.  Ignoring her still, Opie. 
[00:15:00]  All right, I'm about to walk up to someone else.  I don't know about you, Anthony, but I may crap my pants.  I already did, Opie.  You smell that in here?  I just crap myself.  I'm on the edge of my seat.  All right, I'm about to go up to someone else.  Excuse me.  I have to keep going.  I have to keep going?  I'm just telling a couple of jokes.  I'm trying to humor the crowd here before they go in.  But I'm just trying to get the crowd warmed up for Letterman.  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm going to do that.  Thank you. 
[00:15:30]  I have jokes.  I have a joke joke.  I can warm the crowd up for you.  You don't even have to pay me.  He did a drive-by joke into the Letterman audience, and he got yelled at and kicked out by the David Letterman people.  Blake, what do you call a teenage black kid who turns on a violent crack?  Dead.  First of all, don't make me do this, okay?  Don't do it, okay?  This is called the Letterman.  I'm trying to warm up the crowd for you.  Spaz.  Spaz.  I'm trying to make people laugh.  You keep telling jokes. 
[00:16:00]  You can tell jokes on the sidewalk.  It's allowed.  What does a black family do for a daughter on the 13th birthday?  I don't know.  Throw a baby shower.  That's good.  God, that is good.  Hey, Spaz, let's play a new game, okay?  Okay.  Called Punch the Bitch in the Face.  That's going to make next month's issue of the best bits of the month.  Hey, Spaz.  Excuse me.  Who circumcises whales?  Whoreskin Divers. 
[00:16:30]  Whoreskin Divers.  Hey, Spaz, are you still by the Letterman studio?  No, they actually kicked me away.  They had two people literally pushing me away.  You're allowed to tell jokes on the street, you know.  I understand that, but they won't even let me on the block.  They pushed me across the street.  Drive by Joke and go, why?  Let's try this one more time.  We got our Spaz on the streets.  Do you know that the high divorce rate is largely a function of arithmetic? 
[00:17:00]  Because most divorces happen when wives put two and two together.  I don't know.  Do you think that was funny?  I don't know.  He doesn't even speak English.  He doesn't speak English.  Hey, Spaz, steal his wallet.  How dangerous are the cocaine wars in Miami?  Well, this Christmas, Bob Hope is flying in to entertain the police.  A Bob Hope joke.  He's been dead for like 12 years.  From 1988 when he could still breathe. 
[00:17:30]  Coming up, horrible scopes.  Yeah, we're going to do the horrible scopes right after this fantastic bit.  Spaz, you want to try one more drive-by joke?  Come on, Spaz.  Why was the whore with VD so worn out?  All she ever did was just eat and run.  Oh, the whore, eat and run, you get it?  She's sucking a c***.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that.  But, yeah, yeah, she's doing that oral thing.  You're absolutely outrageous. 
[00:18:00]  I got out of heaven.  I cursed.  All right, Spaz, any more drive-by joking?  When has NASA decided to name the new space shuttle?  The Titanic.  Oh, the Challenger joke.  That's very topical.  I think Dice is using that at the garden.  All right, Spaz, I think this was a great bit.  Spaz, catch your wacky butt.  Back up into the studio.  What are you doing?  He's showing jokes on the street, Opie.  How in slow line is that? 
[00:18:30]  Did you hear about the movie starring the rampaging senior citizen?  It's called Gumbo, Tired Blood Part 2.  Gumbo.  Ah, come on, back up here, you wacky man.  All right.  We need coffee.  There he goes, our Spaz, everyone.  Yeah.  He's our Spaz.  You can't have him.  Our old Spaz.  Boy, he'll chew anything.  I'll be drive-by joking.  How insane is that? 
[00:19:00]  Unbelievable.  That's good.  I was hoping for some charro jokes myself.  Casey, what's going on in that?  Please stop the radio voice.  It's giving me douche chills.  What's the problem, Stacey?  Horrible.  Hang the phone up, goose guy.  Totally horrible.  Stacey and the sunshine band on the phone, Ant.  Oh, Stacey and the sunshine band.  That's a good one, Opie.  Thank you.  Love you guys.  Goodbye.  Bye, Stacey. 
[00:19:30]  You're a twat.  Oh, did I just say twat?  You can't say twat on the radio, Anthony.  Leave that to the guys at WNW.  They can say anything over there.  We're owned by Disney.  We've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  WNW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Bobby, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Uh, listen, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me this week for one of my friends.  Ah, that's tough enough to cry.  I was hoping maybe you guys could help me out, try to get me over this, because it's really bothering me.  And how old are you? 
[00:20:30]  I'm 23.  You really like this girl, even though she was nailing your friend?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Are you still friends with the guy?  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  Did you punch him in the head?  I wish I did.  Why didn't you?  Because I'm 23.  I got a job.  I don't want to lose that, you know?  Hey, he's a smart guy.  You know, you can't stop doing that.  Why, does he work with you?  No, no, no, no.  You want to go in the closet with Spaz?  No, thank you.  Oh, no.  You know what you're going to have to do?  What?  How long ago was this?  Two weeks now. 
[00:21:00]  Are you getting any better?  No.  No, huh?  You cut off all contact with her?  No, I can't.  I can't do that.  So, what?  You keep calling her?  Yeah, I do.  Damn.  I do a bit.  I know.  She's going to start thinking you're pathetic.  I know, dude.  You want to get her on the line and see what the problem is?  She's probably out with her friends or out with this guy.  She's probably getting, you know.  Oh, don't dig it in, Opie.  Come on, man.  Dude, what are you doing, man?  The thought of that is like turning this guy's stomach.  It is, man.  What do you think is going on right now with her? 
[00:21:30]  Right now, what do I think she's doing?  Yeah, what position do you think she's in?  Oh, dude.  What are you doing, man?  You're killing the guy.  You're killing the guy.  Come on, bro.  Bobby, it happens to the best of us.  I know.  It is, dude.  Opie, you don't want to hear it, though.  It has happened to every guy alive.  But I love her, man.  Oh.  Oh, come on, Bobby.  Yeah.  No, this guy.  Come on, man.  We've all been here.  Don't harass the poor guy.  You think she's getting the jackhammer, like the guy's drilling for the oil or something?  Oh, bro, come on, man.  What are you doing? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, no.  What are you doing?  I'm already hurting us, man.  Well, we're just trying to make you laugh.  I know.  That's terrible.  She was really good at sex, too, huh?  She was great.  Yeah.  How long did you go out with her?  Three years.  How'd she look?  She was beautiful.  She still is beautiful.  How old is she?  She's 20.  20?  20, huh?  How long did it take for her to give it up?  I don't want to say that over the radio.  Were you the first guy she was with or something?  Oh, no.  I'm not going to say that either over the radio.  Was she the first girl you've been with? 
[00:22:30]  Bobby, all I want to know, is she kind of easy?  Was she easy?  Like, I mean, within a week, what?  Man, I'm not going to put it down because I know people that I know are listening to  the show right now.  Well, I'm just asking.  You know what it is?  No, he's still in that phase where there's hope.  Oh, like, he still has that hope that they're going to get back together.  But after that goes away, you will trash this girl like no one has ever been trashed.  I love this too much, man.  No, you will.  Do you think your buddy is, you know, oh, dude. 
[00:23:00]  No, in all honesty, I'm just wondering.  I know.  All I know is that they're going out every night and I don't want to know.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's it.  I had this happen to me, man.  Swear to God.  Pretty much like the same thing, too.  It happened to all of us.  Friend of mine.  I was totally, like, taken with a girl.  It was in high school and stuff.  And I just went with my friend.  It was devastating.  How could these freaking get people, you know?  How could you do that to your friend, man? 
[00:23:30]  You want to smack them.  All right, Bobby, the listeners are coming through with some advice for you here.  All right.  Let's see what Mike has to say.  All right.  Mike, you're on the line with Bobby.  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Listen, man, just get over the video, all right?  I've seen a fag.  Ah, come on, bro.  I love this girl.  Ah, listen, man.  Just get on with it.  There's other fish in the sea, man.  Give me a break.  Yeah, Bobby, you've got to go out and, you know, yeah, and get some.  A little strange might make you feel better.  If you want, man, give me your number.  I'll take care of it, you know?  Uh-huh. 
[00:24:00]  You're terrible.  Hey, Bobby, who'd she look like?  The girl from Two Raiders.  Dude, that's a cartoon.  That's a computer image.  It kind of looked like that.  Yeah, she wanted to see her, even.  Did she used to dress up in the Tomb Raider outfits for you?  She wanted to, but we never got around to that.  See, you should have got around to it.  I bet you with your friend, you know, they're up to level eight.  They're treating you like those little monkeys. 
[00:24:30]  Alex, what do you have for Bobby?  Dude, this guy is the biggest wuss I've ever had.  Come on, man.  You're sitting here practically crying for opening a day.  No, I'm not crying, bro.  It's like you're crying, man.  So look, man, you know how many girls there are in this world?  Go out and find a good boy.  Go out.  Don't sit in your house and cry.  I'm not crying, man.  I go out all the time.  Why would you keep on sweating her, like calling her up every day? 
[00:25:00]  Because you're just going to think you're more of a loser,  and she's going to not want to hang out with you even more.  The guy just was in love with the girl.  What can he say, you know?  Really?  You can't just shut it off, dude.  The girl was doing your best friend or whatever.  I don't know if she's doing it.  I don't want to think about it.  No, I know you don't want to think about it, but, dude, you know something?  Let's look at the reality.  You need reality.  With your best friend or whatever, and, you know,  why would you want to go back to that? 
[00:25:30]  You can't trust the girl.  She's obviously a waste.  Find yourself a good girl.  Yeah, you know, he makes a good point there.  Man, that's a rough situation for Bobby.  It sucks.  And then the thoughts just go through your head of everything you've done with the girl.  And then you're just picturing your pal doing it.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just awful.  That is awful, man.  You know what's worse than that?  When you see your pal with the girl out on the town or something, 
[00:26:00]  and you run into him.  Well, then you just leave.  Yeah, but you still get that feeling deep inside.  Like, oh, this sucks.  You just got to find another girl, I guess,  and kind of see what happens.  Well, we still have Bobby on the line here, Ant.  We're still trying to get your friend on the line  to find out if he's banging your ex-girlfriend.  He's probably working anyway, dude.  Well, I'll tell you the truth.  He's not answering his cell phone, which, that's bad news.  He's probably in the middle of the act right now.  Oh, come on, man. 
[00:26:30]  Leave the guy alone, man.  What are you doing?  I'm just telling you how it is.  When you have a cell phone, why wouldn't you be answering it?  Maybe he's working, man.  All right?  Maybe he's working.  And what do you got over there?  Dave J. from Manhattan has a little advice for you.  He said, this guy, Bobby, needs to get over it.  At least his girlfriend left for another guy.  Mine left because she wanted to be with a woman.  This is true.  After three years, she decided she wasn't happy,  and somehow a bearded clam would fix everything. 
[00:27:00]  See, Bobby, it could be worse out there.  I guess.  There's always someone in a worse situation than you.  You got to remember that.  Yeah.  Kathy.  Yeah.  You're on the line with Bobby.  Listen, I just want to say one thing.  I was dating this guy for like six months,  and I really loved him so much.  I thought he was the one.  And I met his friend, and it was just instant love.  I thought I knew love.  I didn't know love until I met his friend,  and we ended up getting married. 
[00:27:30]  That's not helping, guys.  Why?  All right, let me try to help Bobby here.  Kathy, so when you started dating a friend,  you were willing to do it.  Oh, come on.  Do it, dude.  Bring me those.  At first, I didn't think so,  but it ended up the love overtook everything.  Oh.  I don't want to hear that, guys.  I don't want to hear that.  Hey, Bobby.  Yeah.  Did she do everything for you? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She did.  God, those are hard to find.  Oh, man.  Did she give you the rusty trombone?  I'm not going to get too into it, man,  because I don't want to trash her name  and have a lawsuit on me, you know?  All right.  Nah.  All right.  I think we have one more person  to give advice to you, Bobby, all right?  All right.  Oh, Dirty.  Yeah, sir.  Oh, dang.  We've got to help the youngster out here.  All right.  You're on the line with Bobby.  Yo, Bobby.  Walk him through this, man.  Dude.  What's up?  Yo, K-Pasa, man.  What, this dude, this guy was your homeboy? 
[00:28:30]  He was your boy?  What's up?  I grew up with this kid, man.  What?  I grew up.  I've known him since I was eight years old.  Like that?  Like that.  He lived around the corner.  He lived around the corner.  He lived around the corner.  Damn, dude.  Yo, you've got to listen to me, my brother.  Bros before hoes.  How's this brother going to do this to you?  Yo, B.  Yo, you've got to start lifting some weights, kid.  I do.  Yo, I joined the community.  I'm telling you, B.  You better tell this kid, yo, what time it is, son. 
[00:29:00]  You've got to get this kid to respect you, B.  He disrespected you right there.  You know what I'm saying?  He could have stepped up to you and said, yo, I'm going to hit that.  Do you mind?  All right, man.  It's all good.  You know what I'm saying?  All right?  You know, I can understand that.  Because I asked my boy if I could hit his girl.  He said it was all right.  But if he would have said no, I wouldn't have done it.  You know what I'm saying?  I wouldn't have disrespected him like that.  Why are you guys laughing, man?  Yeah, your advice is classic, man.  Hey, old Dirty, you think his friend threw a tray up into that piece yet or what? 
[00:29:30]  Yo, I'm about to throw a tray up in that piece, too, B.  No, I'm kidding.  Throw a tray up in that piece.  So don't you think Bobby needs to just get out there and start dating some rods?  Yeah, B, yo.  There's mad skins out there, homie.  How old are you?  43.  Yo, bro, you a youngster, kid.  You got your whole life ahead of you, son.  I'm telling you, B.  Yo, but you better go bust that kid's ass, B.  Nah, I'm not going to do that, bro.  Why not, man?  I have a good job right now.  Where you work, yo?  Where you working at, son?  I work in the post office. 
[00:30:00]  Post?  One of my freaking mails late.  Uh-oh.  You work in the post office?  Yep.  Yo, so what?  You ain't eating?  You can't sleep?  All that?  You got all the symptoms of heartbrokenness?  Seriously.  Yo, crack a 40, son.  I'm telling you, B.  Dr. O.D. prescribing a 40.  Yes.  O.E.  And call me in the morning.  The doctor of love on the phone.  You still talking to the chick?  Uh, I call her all the time, man.  Why are you calling a 40, man? 
[00:30:30]  What does she say?  I'm losing.  And what does she say to you when you call?  Don't call me no more.  Yeah.  Sometimes I get that.  Sometimes I get it.  Yo, yo, dude.  Get over that, yo.  But yo, crack a 40, son.  All right, old dirty.  All right, brothers.  Have a good show.  All right, old dirty.  Thank you.  Sound advice from old dirty.  Yes, sir.  All right, Bobby.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Later.  Old dirty saying he's got to get over it.  Mm-hmm.  But in the meantime, he can medicate himself with a 40.  Yes.  To make him feel a little better during the time, the few weeks where you're really going 
[00:31:00]  to be feeling bad.  You know, sometimes that's just the best thing to do.  Well, that's it.  It really is.  That's one of those situations like getting fired from your job where you just have to start  drinking.  I don't care what it is.  You've been drinking, Bobby?  No, no.  No?  See, maybe you should just start drinking.  Let's throw back a couple to numb the pain a little bit.  You smoking doobies?  Well.  Yeah, a couple of bones and stuff.  But then you get all bummed, right?  Yeah.  Sit there feeling bad for yourself on the couch and just feeling bad. 
[00:31:30]  The next time you see your ex-girlfriend, this will be playing.  What are you doing?  No.  Come on.  What are you doing?  No.  What?  Dude.  Come on.  That's not cool.  That's bad.  Come on.  Dude.  You know what?  Dude, are songs like just killing you?  Yeah.  What was your song?  What was your little song?  We didn't really have a set song. 
[00:32:00]  No, but like every song is like about her and stuff now.  Oh, that's awful.  God.  That feeling sucks, man.  It does, man.  I feel like complete crap, man.  You're not alone.  It happens to pretty much every single one of us.  Got to.  All right, Bobby, as we go to commercials here, we want to play a song for you.  A little song for you.  Don't hurt me, guys.  Well, we're not hurting you.  All right, guys.  We're just trying to get you over this.  All right.  I trust you.  Yeah?  I don't know if I trust you, but I'll listen. 
[00:32:30]  Here it comes.  Yeah?  Here it comes.  You hear it, Bobby?  Not yet.  No?  No.  You hear it?  I do hear it.  Oh, yeah.  You'll find out.  Remember this old classic?  Everybody's trying to tell me. 
[00:33:00]  What are you doing?  Right for me.  What?  What?  Just listen.  It'll probably make you feel better.  Put a little perspective on things.  You guys trying to get me to break down or something?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh, I will be here.  She's gone.  Oh, man.  Remember Bobby?  Come on.  She's gone.  Remember your first date?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're having a hole in three years. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  It's like a lot.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Oh, there's your friend.  Remember the feeling the first time you guys had sex?  Yeah, I do.  How good it was?  I do.  Best feeling ever, right?  It was.  God, now she's gone.  Now she's gone.  Possibly doing your best friend.  What are you doing to me, guys?  Terrible.  I hate that.  Don't take it high.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  And it's off.  Turn it off.  Like George C. Scott in that movie.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Hardcore.  Hey, is your friend a big black guy?  No, he's not a big black guy.  Thank God.  Thank God.  All right, Bobby.  Remember the first time she put her hand down in the front of your pants?  Oh, come on.  Remember that?  Remember the first time you felt patch? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, come on.  Just asking.  We're just asking if you remember these things.  Of course I remember these things.  You all right, Bobby?  I'm all right.  Remember the feeling when you just kissed her?  Nothing better in the world, right?  Oh, man.  Yeah, it really was.  Never want to look at another girl.  Never did.  Never did.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  I better let her face it.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  I'll pay the devil to replace her. 
[00:35:00]  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  Oh, man.  What?  What's wrong, Bobby?  Maybe this is the wrong song to try to cheer him up.  I think it is.  You sure?  All right, Bobby.  The song's almost over here.  You're not going to break me down, man.  Except for the big part right here.  Yeah, this is always good.  This is the killer. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I think you are the human person, don't you?  What?  This is the people which are putting me through.  What are you talking about?  We're just trying to get you over this with a little humor.  The listeners are suggesting songs for you, Bobby.  Oh, no.  Are you going to hurt me now?  No.  Remember this one?  The classic song by the Cars. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  You might remember this.  Always dancing down the street.  This way through the ice.  Does she have blue eyes, Bobby?  Yeah, she did.  Oh, dance.  Every new boy that you meet, doesn't know the real surprise.  Here she comes again.  When she stands beneath the stormy sky.  Oh, yeah.  Ooh.  You'll make it clear she comes again. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, this is best friend's girl.  Yeah, my best friend's girl.  Yeah.  Come on.  Did you like the way she skipped?  I liked everything about her, man.  There it is.  She's my best friend's girl.  Here comes a line that hurts.  But you used to be my best friend's girl.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, 
[00:37:00]  Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is  this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  Look who's stopping by for a little visit today.  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  I ain't written a new joke since 82.  Oh.  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  How are you?  I'm great.  You have the worst luck, and I'll tell you why. 
[00:37:30]  You always show up the day after Ant and I do some just incredible,  you know, blowout show the night before.  So we're just hungover, tired.  That's all you need, fresh blood.  Yeah.  Fresh attitude.  We're so vulnerable when you come in.  Definitely.  You always catch us when we're hungover.  You don't look too bad.  We don't look bad?  He looks like crap.  Like 3.30, yeah.  I was up so late.  Wow, you went to the dice show?  Well, we hosted the dice show.  Ah.  He gave you some time up there, Jeffrey. 
[00:38:00]  I was with Don Barris, one of his opening acts at 3 in the morning, getting wasted.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton, did he go on, too?  Oh, yeah.  Jim Norton killed.  Jim Norton killed.  Jim Norton's very funny.  Funny guy.  I was at Game 5 of the World Series.  You were there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How was it?  Yeah, it was really exciting, man.  It was really cool.  How are you doing?  It's exciting if you're a Yankee fan.  You know what?  People hate hearing this, but I really love the Mets and the Yankees.  You're one of those guys.  I saw a playoff game at Yankee Stadium. 
[00:38:30]  I rooted for the Yankees.  I was in Shea last night.  The Mets were down.  I rooted for the Mets.  What's wrong with that?  New York, New York.  They named it twice.  You got to commit to a team.  Yeah, you really got to commit.  It was all about committing to a team for the subway.  I would get pissed when I walk down the street and you see a store that says,  Go Yanks.  And then in the other window, Go Mets.  Come on.  Make the choice.  Oh, we got to talk to Brewer.  Brewer owes me $1,000, by the way.  Yeah.  Is Brewer calling us today?  I don't know.  You were too drunk last night.  Yeah, Brewer called us really late. 
[00:39:00]  He wasn't in his box seats.  That was weird.  It's shit.  No, he's in, like, Montreal or something.  Oh, yeah.  I usually see him in his box seats.  He's got tickets.  Jeffrey, we get back to the station, like, 1230 after the Dice show,  after watching the rest of the game,  and we're just getting our stuff to go our own ways and stuff.  My phone rings, and it's Brewer just hammered from Montreal talking about the Mets.  And he promised he would call us today, but I don't know what's going on with that.  We got to bump you for a minute.  No, you can actually help us.  We got to talk to the robot from Lost in Space.  Oh, my God.  Can I get some calls?  Is it the actual robot? 
[00:39:30]  No, it's the guy.  It's Bob May.  Bob May.  You're on, Bob.  Hello there.  How you doing, Bob?  Pretty good.  Who is this?  Anthony?  Both of us are here, Anthony and Opie.  All right, Opie.  Yeah.  Now, you guys are coming over to see our show, I hope.  Oh, get the plug in right away.  You're damn right.  I'm not going to fool around, you see, because my big friend is Big Kev.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I mean, he's very good with all the stars in Hollywood.  Wait, I've just been informed you're not even the voice guy. 
[00:40:00]  You're just the guy.  All right, now, wait.  Let me explain everything.  You're just the guy that was in the robot?  I'm not a guy.  Listen to this.  Wait a minute.  I'm the actor who was the one that created the part.  I did all the dialogue with Jonathan Harris.  And, in fact, there's some funny stories about Jonathan and I.  Oh, dear.  I bet.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, the pain.  Dear boy.  Now, Opie, I want to hear a good...  No, it's Anthony.  I want to hear an imitation of Jonathan.  He was just doing it.  Oh, that wasn't Jonathan.  Shut up, you bubble-headed boobie. 
[00:40:30]  Very Jonathan.  Now, listen.  No, the way it worked very simply is our announcer...  You clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Well, don't forget bubble-headed boobie, please.  Thought I just said that.  Oh, that...  Well, never fear.  Smith was there.  Now, wait a minute.  You did the trading, the little banter with Jonathan Harris.  All that on the soundstage, and weeks later, in post-production,  our announcer would loop over the top of my line.  Oh, so you're not even famous.  But you're not the guy.  Hey, don't start with me, baby. 
[00:41:00]  I'm from New York.  I did Broadway.  I'll pick your buns.  I wanted to hear the robot.  What happened?  Why can't we speak with the robot?  All right, listen, guys.  Yeah.  I'm in Australia with our announcer.  We're doing a public appearance.  And we're on the radio station with this DJ.  And so Dick Tufelt, who was our announcer,  and I drove the poor DJ nuts because I said,  Warning.  And he went, Warning. 
[00:41:30]  And the guy says, Who the hell's doing this?  So we did the whole show that way.  Hello, that was a joke.  Hey, guys, why don't you just save time and...  Can we just pass out some NyQuil around the studio?  Where'd you find this guy?  Hey, no, listen.  You guys are big fans of Jonathan.  Oh, of course.  And rightfully so.  He's a great guy.  And what?  Did you ever see him touch young William?  Well, I saw him.  He was always grabbing him from behind. 
[00:42:00]  Wow!  We were doing a scene one day where Jonathan had to polish the robot.  Yeah.  For a thing he lost his bet.  Polish the robot.  So he was polishing the robot.  And I said, Lower.  And he got lower.  And I said, Lower.  He got even lower.  Finally, he dropped his hand lower.  And I turned right around to him.  And I said, I love you.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[00:42:30]  Hello?  Wait, wait, Bob.  I can't get past the fact that you're not the guy.  Yes, I am.  You were just the guy in the suit.  Don't start with me.  Were you actually in the suit?  Yeah.  Now, are you a man of short stature?  Yes, I am.  And how tall would you be?  I am 5'6".  Okay.  And did you move it around in there?  Yeah.  I did everything with it.  In fact, Irwin Allen allowed Jonathan Harris and myself  to create our own characterization.  What's your claim to fame? 
[00:43:00]  I mean, you didn't even walk.  Oh, yes, I did.  Was it on a wheel thing?  No.  When it was in the full outfit, they pulled it with cables  because the thing weighed 350 pounds.  They pulled it with cables?  And then sometimes I would carry the top section,  which weighed 250 pounds.  I would carry that on a parachute-type harness.  And just when we thought we were a big deal,  we were at the garden in front of 11,000 people.  Yeah.  This shows how pathetic we still are.  We can't even get the guy that does the robot voice  from Lost in Space.  Who's his agent?  Forrest Lawn?  How old is he? 
[00:43:30]  Who is the agent?  William Morris.  That's Forrest Lawn.  That's for damn sure.  Ah, but the actual William Morris.  That's the guy.  The guy.  So, hey, what have you done lately?  What have I done lately?  Well, since Lost in Space,  I did several Jerry Lewis films, of course.  Wow.  There you go.  That'll get you a few laughs.  You're definitely Lost in Space.  Oh, I'm Lost in, and you believe it.  What do you ask a guy that was just in a suit  and didn't do the voice?  You ever fart in the costume? 
[00:44:00]  No, but I'll tell you this.  Mark Goddard and Bill Moomey locked me in there for lunch.  Two things happened.  Well, yeah.  Number one, my wife knew where I was every moment.  And second of all, I had nothing else to do,  so I lit up a cigarette, and I was smoking,  and Irwin Allen came on the set,  saw smoke coming out of it,  went for the fire extinguisher.  And it didn't happen, of course.  But from then on,  any time smoke had to come out of the robot,  they handed me a cigar.  You want really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah.  Let's just not say anything anymore until he hangs up. 
[00:44:30]  Check it out with Mark Goddard.  All right.  That's...  Wow.  What else can you tell us?  What else can I tell you?  Yeah, hey.  Well, I, as a robot, you know,  I have a great memory because my computer...  Now let him go.  Let him go until he gets there.  ...focus on all different things.  So now I have a memory of you guys,  and I expect to see your asses out here at the convention.  If you're not out here,  I'll send Dr. Smith to do what he's done to many of us.  Now, since you have such a busy schedule, 
[00:45:00]  and dialogue is at a rarity,  I must go because I've got to get down to the fans.  But I really appreciate being on your show,  and I look forward to you coming out and being on mine.  All right, guys, and remember,  if you want a star, get a hold of Big Ken. 
[00:45:30]  Kev does it all.  All right, thanks.  Hey, guys, it's Big Kev.  I have never felt more like a Met my entire life.  My God.  All right, say something.  Ping-pong balls, anything.  Whatever, Ben.  Hello? 
[00:46:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  That is so uncomfortable.  Oh, I am friggin' sweating.  I'm cringing.  That is awful.  It's so uncomfortable.  Now, Big Ken's got to be like,  no, that show, you know.  Sometimes the zipper would get stuck. 
[00:46:30]  Other times.  One time I put the right leg on backwards,  and I had to start over again and put the left leg on.  One time I was lost in Cleveland.  One time I was lost in Trenton, New Jersey.  I had never been lost in space.  Not really.  However,  it's actually two costumes. 
[00:47:00]  It's fascinating.  One I would make for public appearances.  Dude, we had to do that same interview with the guys that were in the Star Wars suits.  I was like, what do you ask them?  Yeah, when the movie came out, it was the last movie came out, Star Wars one.  All the guys who are not in the most recent Star Wars movie were here.  Like Boba Fett.  The guy that was in R2-D2. 
[00:47:30]  The guy that played Darth Vader.  The Wookiee.  And the Darth Vader guy.  Right.  And we didn't know what to ask him,  because all they were were the guys in the suits.  And it turned out he was only the Darth Vader one in the, like, third one.  Like, it wasn't even the first Darth Vader guy.  It was like the third one.  Interesting enough.  Interesting enough.  The suits today are flame retarded.  One time I was smoking a cigar. 
[00:48:00]  In between takes.  In between takes.  It was episode number 72, where we get lost in space.  And an ash fell on my leg.  Now, these suits today, they're flame retarded.  But I lost a toe that day.  Erwin Allen came over to me and said, where's your toe?  The great Erwin Allen.  The great Erwin Allen. 
[00:48:30]  Not to be confused with Marty Allen, Steve Allen.  Herb Allen.  Paul Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Allen.  Poor Allen.  Then he has to go, well, I got to go.  I got to go.  Wait, someone's pissed at us.  Come on, that was funny.  Kathy, what's up?  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  This guy has the littlest claim to fame, and you totally killed him. 
[00:49:00]  We thought we were getting the voice, you know, and through the voice.  We thought we had the guy.  Oh, my God.  Warning, warning, Will Robinson.  Get back to the Jupiter 2.  That poor little old guy.  Now, he's all upset, and you guys are laughing, and then you try to make it up by saying, go  see his show.  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Kathy.  I would put one of my hooked hands in your ass.  Anyway, it was pretty funny, though, listening to dead space. 
[00:49:30]  But at the same time, you guys are mean.  Love you.  See you.  All right.  Bye.  He was lost in space.  He was.  A lot of people saying that.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Get Big Kev back on the phone, by the way.  Dan.  Yeah, I want to see what the aftermath of that debacle was.  Hello, Dan?  You gone?  All right.  Well, Bob May, the guy that was in the robot suit, Bill Big Kev is going to have to kill  a few more children and bury him in his basement to make up for the aggravation of that call. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I'll call you, Opie, and you, Anthony.  And now I'm going to kill you.  All right.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, the actual robot would be funnier than that guy.  Well, possibly, yeah.  I resent that.  Anyway.  I think it's easy putting on that costume every day for 60 straight years.  How many times can you tell people how much it weighed and how many pieces it was in?  When I see these actors like Jim Carrey in his Grinch costume, it's reminding me of the 
[00:50:30]  day that Irwin Allen and I were lost on the Jersey Turnpike going to this for Cocktail  convention.  I go.  And one more guy calls me Mr. Spock.  And I go, I go, but you don't, you didn't even walk in the costume.  Well, we had a bully system.  No, you didn't.  Cables would drag him around.  And he's just standing inside this thing.  So it's not even like body mannerisms. 
[00:51:00]  What about the arms?  They used to wave around.  Winnie would go, warning, warning, warning.  And then he would talk like, warning, warning.  Hey, Smith, wax me.  And then they'd have the guy overlay.  Hey, Dr. Smith, please shine my armor.  But he'd be, ah.  Classic.  I had 15 minutes of fame. 
[00:51:30]  Unfortunately, my face was covered.  You know, why would you put yourself in that position?  People are going to show up and go, wow, do the voice.  Well, I don't do the voice.  I don't do the voice.  I was just in the suit.  You know every single person.  Every single person that goes there that wants to see the robot is going to ask them to do the voice.  And then, oh, I didn't do the voice.  But the costume weighed 500 pounds, and it was pulled by a cable system. 
[00:52:00]  One time I was smoking.  They didn't even trust me to walk.  They had to pull me with a cable.  They would pull these.  These kids today, Alf and Chewbacca, they don't know what it was like.  Actors strike my ass.  Byron Allen, Debbie Allen, Allen from Scooby-Doo and I.  Wow.  Damn, that was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a break. 
[00:52:30]  We'll be back.  O.P.  S.O.A.  1-0-2-7  E.M.A.  W.  God finds mine  The one to see the light  The one to see  God's old mind  The one to see  God's life  Oh, I say  God finds mine  The one to see  The one to see 
[00:53:00]  God's old mind  The one to see  God's life  The one to see  We can talk about O.J.  Oh, God.  There's going to be a story coming out of what?  The Enquirer?  Yeah.  Because O.J. broke up with his girlfriend?  Well, it seems his girlfriend broke up with O.J.  Yeah, sorry.  She broke up with him and she started seeing things and really seeing the light.  Well, I guess, first of all, she's a Nicole Brown Simpson lookalike. 
[00:53:30]  Uh-huh.  They were doing a lot of blow together.  Yeah.  And she's starting to see the light, like you said, that, wow, this guy may have killed Nicole Brown Simpson after all.  She's convinced.  I mean, she is 100% sure that O.J. killed those two people, just like everyone else.  Does she feel stupid now?  Like that everybody, from the second she hooked up with him, were like, what are you, insane?  This guy's a murderer.  But no, now she realizes. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, his life is just slowly rotting away.  And now I hear things like, um, she's saying that he leaves messages on her answering machine.  He broke into her house to try to erase one of the messages because they were very incriminating, very angry.  And then he's been peering through her windows, dude.  Yeah, well, she says he's stalking her.  Sure.  Hello.  Hello, this is O.J.  Hello.  Pick up the phone.  Pick up the phone.  Please, look, please pick up the phone. 
[00:54:30]  It's the O.J.  I'll wait.  Hello?  Hello?  You goddamn bitch.  Pick up the goddamn phone.  I'll cut your mother effing head off.  Oh, damn, I'll put that on tape.  Okay.  I gotta break in.  I gotta, oh, damn, I shouldn't be saying this on tape.  Hello, pick up, please.  It's the O.J.  It's the O.J.  I didn't do nothing.  So, it gets crazier, though.  Oh, there's drugs involved.  I guess this ex-girlfriend's gonna tell the Inquirer that O.J. blamed Nicole for her own death, saying she drove him crazy. 
[00:55:00]  This, uh, girl, Christy Brody.  Mm-hmm.  The blonde.  Nicole look-alike.  And, uh, yeah, it seems that O.J. gave her these graphic details of the murder.  And stuff that she says only the killer would know.  Second-by-second, uh, synopsis of, of the murder by O.J., uh, during all-night cocaine binges, she says, O.J. would maniacally reenact scenes from his murder trial, pretending to cross-examine witnesses. 
[00:55:30]  Like, all, all coked up.  All right, here's how it was.  Like, Johnny Coughman's to my left, right?  And I'm over here.  And, you know, the rest of the Dream Team is over here.  And there's a witness on there.  Now, let me ask you, Mr. Fong, what did you do with your blood evidence when you picked it up?  And now he's got no answer.  I put it in a bag and brought it to lab. 
[00:56:00]  See, now he put it in a bag.  But where did that bag come from?  A sterile bag.  Another sterile bag.  Ah, but do you know, where's the sterilizing company?  My blood could have dripped on the sterilizing companies.  Where's some more cocaine?  Hello, pick up.  Pick up.  I need more cocaine.  Oh, damn, I shouldn't have said that on the tape.  This isn't the O.J.  This isn't O.J.  This is Pedro Guerrero.  Please, pick up the phone.  I swear.  Pedro Guerrero. 
[00:56:30]  He got a coke problem, Pedro Guerrero, because whenever he has some, he never gives me any.  What's the problem?  Pedro Guerrero.  Remember that?  Like, months ago, it turns out that a 911 call was made by O.J.  saying that his chick, this chick, this Christy Pratty girl, was fighting with him.  I love the O.J. prank call thing.  The 911.  So he calls 911 and says, you know, that there's a problem at the house and she's all drugged 
[00:57:00]  out of her mind.  And it was Pedro Guerrero that gets out of the coke game.  Pedro Guerrero.  Hello.  911.  Pedro Guerrero's got the coke game.  He's a bad guy.  And let me tell you, he cussed it, too, with that baby laxative.  I'm crapping my brains out.  Yeah, O.J. blamed Nicole for her own death, saying she drove him crazy.  O.J. insisted that Pratty abort two of his babies, then completely forgot about the first 
[00:57:30]  abortion, saying he blocks out unpleasant events.  Oh, God.  God.  I blocked it out.  What baby?  What fetus?  What abortion?  I blocked all that out.  I blocked out unpleasant things except the time I slit my wife's throat.  Who is O.J.?  I block out unpleasant things and I'm pretty damn unpleasant.  I'm the O.J.  She also says Simpson has a lump on his kidney and his health is so bad. 
[00:58:00]  Pratty believes he'll be dead in three years.  Think we'll get a deathbed confession out of O.J.?  I doubt it, but that show would be good.  Wouldn't that be great?  But I think he's so pompous that he would never do it.  Hi, this is O.J.  I know I'm dying and I want to come clean.  Nicole and Ron, it was Pedro Guerrero. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, God damn O.J.  He ain't fessing up to crap.  And Pratty also says after breaking up with the O.J.  out of fear that she'd end up like Nicole,  Pratty claims he broke into a suburban Miami apartment  and has been peering into her windows,  stalking her just like he did to Nicole before her murder. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, man.  He's doing the same thing.  Doesn't anyone...  Who still thinks this guy didn't do it?  Pratty says a coked up O.J.  told her over and over his account of what happened the night of the murders.  In Simpson's scenario, he describes the culprit as two killers.  The culprit.  While he never flat out admitted to her that he was the actual killer,  the two killers, O.J. often referred to himself in the third person.  Saying O.J. is this or O.J. did that. 
[00:59:30]  Well, O.J. needs to get coke from Pedro Guerrero.  There were two killers.  I swear, it was O and J.  I swear, O grabbed Nicole.  Then J came up and slit her throat.  And while she was falling down, O grabbed Ron Goldman  as J was in hot pursuit.  They killed.  And then O went to Chicago and J chipped golf balls at his house. 
[01:00:00]  hello pick up this is old jay is very evil i must warn you i am a nice guy and want to warn you  about jay jay is a murderer but oh he's a nice guy oh he's that fun loving guy you see on the  naked gum movie but jay oh he's a bad man who cuts people up with knives watch out oh oh here

[01:25:00]  drive  to the mother's  house  because she  wouldn't drive  uh  jennifer home  for some reason  you had to pass  your house  yeah  i had to pass  my house  meanwhile she  the mother would  pick up jennifer  from the liquor store  and instead of  driving her home  would drive her  to her house  but  drop her off  you know why 
[01:25:30]  i want to go home  because going there  to pick her up  was never going to  pick her up  sit down  and have a  cocktail  pet  and the chest  is in  say hello  hello  and i'd have to  sit there  but thank god  something good  was on tv  they would tape  general hospital  and then watch it  once i got there  for some reason  like because  jennifer would have  gotten home  and the mother  taped the soap opera  so jennifer could  watch it  but they had 
[01:26:00]  something else to  watch until  like 7 o'clock  or 7 30  when i got there  all right  we're gonna  watch the soap opera  get me  could you get  a box of wine  get me a scotch  oh my god  i love that  joan black  stephano jamira  is a scumbag  what  no no  what's the matter  why am i being  looked at so strangely  anthony's lawyer  checking in  stop anthony  stop now  tony  god damn  you guys are 
[01:26:30]  messed up  and i feel  your pain  i don't feel  any pain  no kidding  you box wine  drinking hobo  but i want to go  home  it's like the new  ant  he's starting to  oh yeah  the new ant  to blow off steam  it's therapy  it is therapy  well i was fine  with leaving it alone  but you're doing  like soliloquies  i mean when you  get into this  when he gets into  this though  it's like  it's not a conversation  you just sit back  and listen  until he's done  okay  here he goes again  he's off and running 
[01:27:00]  but i  i had completely  blocked out  the um  the time  we were flying  from boston  to los angeles  los angeles  right  at this time  um  uh  the uh  the significant  others were still  in new york  we were living  at my mother-in-law's  house  correct  and uh  opie has to remind  me that  it for  for a 10 minute  drive  we needed a lift  to what is called  the logan shuttle  it's a bus  we wanted a ride  to logan airport  which was uh 
[01:27:30]  45 minutes away  i can't drive  to logan  i don't like  driving all the way  to the airport  don't like it  i want to stay home  but we're begging  because we don't know  the area yet  right  we don't know  nothing of the area  so she said  she'll drop us off  at uh  the logan shuttle  the logan express  is a bus  it'll take you  to the airport  it's uh  it's a few minutes away  so we all  get in the car  and she drives  which later on  after we had lived  there a while  we realized 
[01:28:00]  where she was  taking us  was probably  a 10 minute  drive  tops  you get on a  road  you get on another  road  and you're there  it took us  about 45 minutes  to get to this place  because i forgot  i blocked this out  whenever the mother-in-law  would take us anywhere  i can't make left turns  i can't make a left turn  but three rights  makes a left  and i always  take the side streets  i always take 
[01:28:30]  the back roads  because i don't like  the highways  highways  it's route 9  if you're familiar  with boston  it's not  it's not  well it's like  jericho turnpike  on the island  it's not  i can't take  lefts  she's afraid  i'm afraid  to make left  hand tunes  afraid  so we sat there  on this  mr toad's wild ride  through the backwoods  of suburban massachusetts  when we realized  later on  this is a 10 minute drive  as she's driving us  you know  to the logan shop 
[01:29:00]  because i can't drive  to the airport  we were almost  we almost missed our flight  remember that  i can't  i choose not  to make left hand tins  but even better  remember when you had  to go to annie margs  annie margs  that was the best story  that you told at lunch today  to this day  i couldn't tell you  how to get there  because it was this maze thing  she should drive for the mob  when you're trying to take  a prisoner  to the camp  you wouldn't even have  to blindfold them  i couldn't remember  where we were 
[01:29:30]  we'd be driving  down these back roads  and you know  i'd be driving  in my car  she's in the back seat  going  alright make a left here  now turn  make a right  i don't know how  to make the left  so we're just gonna  take the way i take  which is a bunch  of right hand tins  make a right  make a right  and i'm driving  in circles  during this way  and later  after living there a while  i realized  again  had to be a five  minute drive  five minute drive  it took  a half hour 
[01:30:00]  but the funny part  about that story  she wasn't driving  you were driving  she was giving directions  with all right turns  i don't even like  being in the car  during left hand turns  and she finally told you  that the reason  yeah  she went that way  it was because  she doesn't like  left hand turns  she didn't know  how to get there  dude she did not  know how to get there  telling me how to get there  by making left turns  because she never done it  so i'm like  why are we making a right  i know it's got to be  this way  because the town  that we were going to  is that way  well anthony  make a right  okay go up 
[01:30:30]  make a right  now make this right  three rights  three rights  make a left  three rights  make a left  where's my squash  get the box of wine  unbelievable  thank you for uh  refreshing my memory  i'm sure you'll come up  with a bunch more opie  opie remembers  he takes pleasure  in saying his aunt  remember the time  judy did this  i'm like  ah  i blocked it out  bill what's going on  hey guys what's up  hey  i got a guy that works 
[01:31:00]  with us that does not  make left turns  and he's a service tech  he drives all day long  on the island  and when he goes  into manhattan  he's a total nightmare  he just keeps going  right and right  and right and right  to get back  so he doesn't make  lefts either  no not at all  he's like petrified  of it it's crazy  huh  and when anybody  else drives  it makes us nuts  driving with him  you'd have to be  a goddamn lunatic  to make a left  on chin  i stick to rights  because then i only  gotta look one way  it's a right chin 
[01:31:30]  your brother wants  in on this  joe  hey joe  that kook  and what about  the time  that we played  up at uh  i forgot the name  of the place  oh god  we were playing  yeah  and you had to  take the van  that we moved  the equipment in  to take her home  dude that was  an i want to go  home story  oh get this  rotgut's playing  we live down in  new york  we got a gig  up in boston  kind of exciting  and fun for a band  so um  judy wants to go

[01:39:30]  her  he was trying to  pull my leg out  and i was very  tense  and i'm laying there  with my eyes closed  and all i remember  is him going and  getting the oils  and then all of a  sudden he was in  my lower private  area  and i just jumped  yeah  sweet merciful crap  like i was very  surprised  and i froze  in shock she says  she got dressed and  immediately told a 
[01:40:00]  female employee  i proceeded to tell  her crying what  happened and she  just hugged me and  said it's not right  it's not your fault  it's not your fault  she knew exactly how  the voice out  as it turns out  mr jew is not  licensed as a masseur  in new york  mr jew  all right i recognize  the voice  that's my mom  yeah  that's why she  won't go  the woman is now  suing him and  maximus spa for  31 million dollars  the purpose of this  lawsuit is really  designed to send a  message to places

[02:12:00]  here we go  here we go  1  nothing wrong  with me  2  nothing wrong  with me  3  nothing wrong  with me  4  nothing wrong  with me  1  something's got  to give  2  something's got  to give  3  something's got  to give  now  It is Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  Hillary Clinton has announced that she's officially running, Anthony.  What a surprise.  For the Senate seat.  Geez, does that mean we don't have to foot the bill anymore for every trip she makes here?  Plot.  Oh.  So finally she announced, and what does that mean?  What does she do now?  Well, she had her speech yesterday. 
[02:13:00]  Check that out.  Mm-hmm.  She pretty much wants to solve every single problem facing the world.  Where will that money come from?  The working slob.  Oh, she'll...  I'm getting scared.  I'm getting scared.  I think she's going to win this damn election.  It scares the crap out of me.  No.  I think there's enough stupid people out there that's going to push her over the top, Anthony.  I still think Rudy's...  Rudy has a narrow lead at this point. 
[02:13:30]  Narrow lead.  I don't know.  They haven't started the mudslinging commercials yet, really.  There'll be some great ones.  She couldn't keep tabs on her husband's affairs.  Are you going to elect her to take care of yours?  Paid for it, my friend.  I wrote each other, honey.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Hey, they both suck, okay?  Yeah, okay.  I cannot think of...  I can't think of who I dislike more.  I mean...  Yeah, that's a great way to look at it.  Everybody in New York thinks Rudy's like a big bully. 
[02:14:00]  I mean, he gets things done, but he's like this big bully, and you don't do it my way,  I'll just push you around until I get what I want.  Yeah.  Okay, so that's Rudy's side of it.  Now, you take Hillary, and she doesn't know a damn thing about what she's doing here.  Doesn't have a clue.  The only reason she's in New York is because New York will let her, without being a true  resident, run for Senate, right?  Correct.  She doesn't get into the Senate.  Bill is history, too.  How long do you think he'll be around?  I hope a while.  I want to see him do stuff.  I know. 
[02:14:30]  We all want to see him around.  Goddamn, I want to see him just party his ass off when he gets out of office.  Oh, it's going to be interesting after he leaves office.  It's great material.  Something's going to go horribly wrong with that guy.  I mean, everybody in New York has got to lose their mind to vote Hillary in, though.  Well, I'm starting to worry about this one.  And that's an insult to New Yorkers, isn't it?  Maybe that'll be the way Bill will get back at Hillary, like for being such a bitch to  him and not giving him any and stuff like that.  He'll just treat her like crap and ruin her name. 
[02:15:00]  You know what I mean?  That'll be fun.  She'll be trying to be this legitimate politician, and he'll just go out and bang.  Hang chicks and hang out in the booby bars.  Wouldn't that be a great episode of Cops?  All of a sudden, a cop gets a call.  We have a domestic dispute in Capacorn.  And Bill just comes out with his wife beater t-shirt on.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  All hammered and stuff.  What the hell do you think?  She comes home all hours, you know, all drunk and everything. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I had a girl in the house, but we wasn't doing nothing.  All stained, like he's wearing this wife beater guinea tee, all stained up and everything.  Comes out of the house.  All right, Mr. President.  Please go back in the house.  Mr. President.  Back in the house.  Come back.  You can't make me do anything.  It's my house.  My house.  I don't care what that bitch says.  F you, man.  F you.  All right.  One more time and you're going in.  One more time, Mr. President. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, go after yourself.  Okay.  Against the car.  Yeah.  Against the car.  Hey, what do you do?  I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  That would be great, man.  That would be hilarious.  Very good, man.  Come in the house.  He's just sitting there with his hand down his pants watching TV.  What?  What?  Drinking.  And then the cop.  Hillary's got a big bruise on her eye.  He beat me.  And then the cop's asking Clinton if he was drinking tonight.  Been drinking. 
[02:16:30]  I might have had a few.  It's my house.  My business.  I was the president.  God damn it.  Go screw yourself.  I'll have your job.  What's your badge now?  I would laugh my ass off.  Cops.  Then a little cop driving back, you know.  How to arrest the president today?  You know, you never know what a day is going to bring this job.  Cops.  Get away from my house. 
[02:17:00]  And the bitch deserved it.  I don't know what you're talking about.  This is my house.  My house.  God damn it.  I was the president.  Get back in your car, you pig.  He tries to stab her with a steak knife.  Get your hand.  F you, man.  F you.  Did you ever see the cops episode where the guy got his ear cut off by his wife?  Yeah.  And they had to find the ear?  Yeah.  That was great.  That show rocks.  Cops.  So I had a chick in the house. 
[02:17:30]  She didn't have to get all effing up about it.  I don't understand.  Mr. President, you know, your wife's very upset.  Why don't maybe, you know, you could leave the household tonight.  They will take you somewhere.  F you, my house.  That bitch don't like it.  She could leave.  I never wanted to move to New York anyway.  You go screw yourself.  Mr. President, if you keep mouthing off, we're going to have to take in.  Take me and go eff yourself.  That bitch, I'll smack her again.  Okay, Mr. President, get the car. 
[02:18:00]  We need backup.  The president's running.  The president's running.  He's on the run down the street.  Down back street.  What you going to do?  Get the helicopter on him.  Get the helicopter on him.  You got nothing on me.  And they have to tackle him.  It's like trying to get over a fence and they set the dogs out to him.  Or they, or they, get away, get away.  Come on.  Or my favorite thing on cops, like they lose them for a little while and then like all of a sudden they shine the light up in the tree and there's the president hiding in the tree. 
[02:18:30]  Or they kick over the kid pool and Clinton's hiding underneath it.  What? I didn't do nothing.  We can, we can all look forward to that if she does win.  That could be cool.  The cop out of breath jumping over the neighborhood fences.  The president is in custody.  I need a car over here. 
[02:19:00]  Well, uh, Mr. President ran down the street.  I, uh, took chase.  He tried to make it over the fence, but a few, too many trips to McDonald's, uh, the extra weight.  I was able to bring him down pretty easy and, uh, put the president in custody.  A few, man.  Hitting his head against the police car window.  And he's trying to kick it out.  Yeah.  The stained guinea tea on.  You tell that bitch I ain't coming back. 
[02:19:30]  He throws something away while he's running away from the cops.  We found these bits of crack as he was running.  The president's running this, uh, he's testing, uh, positive as crack cocaine.  Mr. President, you got anything in your pockets?  No.  I didn't do it.  It wasn't mine.  I was holding it for Chelsea.  It almost makes you, uh, want to have her, uh, win, doesn't it?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Born up a hot dog.  Yeah, I love it.  Trying to kick the back window out.  Running with cuffs on.  Or he gets on his little bike.  That's always good in cuffs, too.  The president gets on a bike and tries to get away from the cops.  He's running.  23 in pursuit.  I wasn't running, but, what? 
[02:20:30]  And they try to, they're so obviously guilty.  And then they catch him.  They come and it's like, what?  What?  In pursuit of the president of the United States.  What'd I do?  Very nice.  She's a fat bitch.  Look at that ass.  Cop.  Brought to you with the cooperation of the men and women of blood. 
[02:21:00]  For a minute.  F you.  F you.  F you.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Zombie.  White zombie.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:30]  Hello.  Why isn't Rob Zombie playing Pope Stock?  Yeah.  Did you hear about this Pope Stock?  It's in the post today, Anthony?  Yeah, I was kind of thumbing through the paper.  I saw that whole thing.  I thought it was a little weird, the Pope getting a little concert together over there.  Is he going to do it right outside the Vatican?  It's in Rome.  In Rome?  Annie Lennox, of course, from the Eurythmics. 
[02:22:00]  Lou Reed?  Lou Reed.  On the bill?  Mm-hmm.  And some Italian broad.  No, that's actually a guy.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  Oh, it's the blind guy, right?  What's his name?  Oh, the Italian tenor.  What?  Andrea Bocelli?  Bocelli, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  What guy with a chick's name?  Hey, Andrea.  Stop that.  Why are you calling me that?  Don't you find it a little weird that the Pope's putting on concerts?  Why not?  What the hell?  Yeah, he's got to do something. 
[02:22:30]  Instead of standing there looking like he's ready to fall over at every appearance.  God, we need a new Pope.  I don't know.  This guy did a great job, you know?  Too bad you can't retire.  You can't retire when you're a Pope, can you?  No, you don't.  You just got to die.  You have to die.  You got to die the Pope, and you got to do everything the Pope does.  They got him.  How old is this guy?  He's not even that old.  Yeah, he's really not that old, but he's just falling apart.  Yeah, I think that gunshot really messed him up a little bit.  Yeah.  Like you got, you know, we just talked to Dr. Zachary Smith earlier.  He's in his 80s. 
[02:23:00]  He's 86.  And he's doing better than the Pope, who's in his 70s.  I think 77, I want to say.  78.  You see him there with that staff.  Yeah.  He's praying, but it just looks like, oh, finally I can shut my eyes and go to sleep.  Wake me when it's over.  He just looks like he's asleep.  And then they just, they put him on planes.  Okay, kiss the ground now.  When you get out, Pope, you got to kiss the ground.  I can't even bend over.  Yeah, I don't think that's terrible. 
[02:23:30]  It's awful.  And now they put, you know, you think the Pope said, hey, guys, I want to put together a rock and roll concert.  No, they came to him and said, hey, we're doing this.  Make it like you made it up.  And what is this concert going to benefit?  I don't know.  Too bad that Gigi Allen's dead.  That would be great to have Gigi Allen throwing feces at the crowd and sticking bananas in his butt and throwing them at people.  I wonder if the Pope's people called Slipknot for the show. 
[02:24:00]  Where is Slipknot and Kitty?  I love the band Slipknot.  They are great.  I love that Korn, too.  That's a good one.  And what about Anthony's band, No Doubt?  Yes, I wish we could have gotten Metallica.  They effing rock.  I love Metallica.  And I believe I have the Pope song here, though, the Pope single.  Now, he's going to hit the stage.  He is, right?  At some point.  Do we actually have some of what he's going to do? 
[02:24:30]  I believe this is the Pope sing, and I can't really confirm it, but let me get the right track here.  What?  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  If you're going to have Pope stock, you've got to get the Pope up there singing a number or two.  All right.  She sits alone, waiting for suggestions. 
[02:25:00]  He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  He's so nervous.  Hey!  He's so nervous.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  If you think I'm sexy, come on, children, let me know. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.  Virgin.  Come on, honey, tell me so.  Virgin.  Hey.  Hey, hey.  He's acting shy, looking for a man. 
[02:26:00]  I don't think this is really the Pope, Opie.  You sure?  I don't think so.  Let's spend the night together.  Coming, coming.  Now we'll talk a minute before we go much further.  Give me a dime so I can call my mother.  If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, children, let me know. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  We're doing Lou Reed.  Lou Reed is going to do the concert.  I'm going to sing with him.  Yeah, he's going to be doing this.  Lou Reed at Pope Stock.  Yeah, there's some pretty risque words in this one, Opie.  Talking about oral sex, transvestites, drugs.  Yeah, that is a little weird if you think about it. 
[02:27:00]  They said something like, you know, about Lou Reed's background.  That it's okay because he's repentant and living a very decent life now.  You know, he's 58, Lou Reed.  Pushing 60.  So he won't even perform his biggest hit at Pope Stock, I bet you.  No, he'll probably do this.  Take a walk on the wild side.  And the Pope goes, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, I want to sit down.  Even when she was giving heads.  Hey, babe.  Yes.  I love the groupies that come backstage.  Suck it.  Suck it, whore.  Suck it.  See, giving heads.  What does that mean?  Say, hey, babe.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Oh, that's going to be a little weird.  Jimmy wants to know on line 10, will the Pope be body surfing? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wouldn't that be funny?  The Pope throws himself out of the crowd.  He's like, oh, I'll ride in the crowd.  Yeah.  Dude, I grabbed the Pope's sack.  You know, the young Pope would have thought about it.  Yeah.  Remember how cool he was when they first made him Pope?  Well, what was that?  Late 70s?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It was like 20-something years ago, right?  Yeah.  79, I think.  He was pretty young.  Well, there was that intermittent Pope that they picked that dropped dead like a week later. 
[02:28:30]  And then they picked this guy because they figured, all right, he's young.  Look, we can't have another Pope that's going to drop dead.  The first Pope, like, dies.  Not the first one, but the one that they had.  Right.  Originally.  They replaced him with another fossilized Pope.  And three days later, he's dead.  So they figure, oh, let's get a young Pope.  So they get this guy, this young guy.  And he's talking about biking, like he used to do a lot of bicycling.  And he was the with it Pope.  And now you look at him now, it's like, oh, it's the same old Pope. 
[02:29:00]  Meet the new Pope.  Same as the old Pope.  I think the Pope's going to be doing a duet with Kid Rock, Anthony.  Pope Stock.  Bang, the bang, diggy, diggy, diggy, set the boogie, set up, jump the boogie.  Fall with the ball, the bang, the bang, the bang, diggy, diggy, diggy, set the boogie, set up.  My name is Paul.  Yes.  Look at Joe C.  Dressed like a little Pope.  Oh, with the ball, the bang, the bang, diggy, diggy, set the boogie, set up, jump the boogie. 
[02:29:30]  Look at all the Cardinals jumping.  Yes.  We're spraying the crowd with cold holy water.  They're very hot.  Spray them.  Look at me.  F you, mother F-ers.  This is great.  The Pope and Kid Rock.  Pope Stock.  Look, that chick painted the Pope hats on her boobs. 
[02:30:00]  Body art.  Yes.  I brought my bitch with me.  Yes.  F you, four dollars for water.  Burn this mother F-er down.  Burn this mother, break something, mother F-ers.  Break something.  F the police. 
[02:30:30]  Pope goes wild, man.  Oh, my God.  Don't eat the brown communion.  Don't eat the brown communion wafers.  And let's, uh, let's take a break.  All right.  If you want in, 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Hello.  How you doing?  Okay.  You're calling about the job.  Right.  Uh, what's, uh, what's your experience in this field? 
[02:31:00]  I worked for a landscaper for like three years.  Yeah.  And before that, you know, I mowed the lawn at my house and stuff.  Yeah.  I did the, uh, you know, edging last, uh, the last job I was on.  I did the edger and, uh, I did the bushes with the, uh, the clippers.  You, uh, you know how to work that big, uh, blower thing?  Oh, I never, I never got to use that thing, the blower.  No.  But you know how to trim bush.  I know how to trim the bushes and I know how to work the, uh, the edger thing.  What's the biggest bush you've ever trimmed? 
[02:31:30]  Uh, pretty big.  Was it like a 70s Earth Mama Moth or?  Like a what?  70s Earth Mama Moth.  That's a little lingo in the business.  I'm sorry.  Like a hedge.  Nah, I don't know the, uh, I don't know what they were called.  Was it like a bush that was shaped in like, um, the shape of like a Hitler mustache?  Like a Hitler mustache?  No.  Yeah, like a hedge, you know.  No, like big though, like, uh, like round.  It was like a nice landing strip?  Like whenever anything custom had to do, my boss, uh, did it, Manny.  Can you handle the big cans? 
[02:32:00]  What, carrying stuff?  Yeah, we fill them up and put them in the truck, you know what I mean?  Like handling the, the big cans.  Yeah, I can carry that stuff.  I can carry anything.  So you're good with, the only thing that.  You're good with cans.  Yeah.  Then you're good at blowing.  Well, I told you, I never did the blowing machine.  But you're willing to learn how to blow?  Yeah.  Oh, that's very nice.  All right, good.  Yeah, I'll blow.  I'll probably use that.  Where do I go down?  Like, uh, do I have to, uh, fill out an application or anything?  Or mail something in?  It says something here about, uh, an address. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, you got the address there?  Yeah.  Okay, good, good.  And what's your name?  Can I get your name?  Yeah, John Huber.  All right, John.  Yeah, my name's John, too.  Um, yeah, if you could possibly maybe, um, I don't know, put some of the bush clippings  in an envelope and send it in.  That would help us out to see what type of bush you've been trimming.  In an envelope?  Should I bring it down there or just put it in an envelope?  Yeah, just mail it to the address, actually.  With some of your, um...  All different, what, different ones or just one type?  It's your qualifications.  Actually, what I would do is, uh, make it like a collage, you know, with all the bush 
[02:33:00]  you've trimmed over the years, if you still have that laying around.  Right.  And, um...  If I don't have it laying around, I don't take the crap home.  Well.  Well, you know, we have higher-ups, too, and they just want to see some kind of, uh,  you know, foliage.  So if I get cardboard...  Yeah, get some cardboard.  And glue, like, the different things on it and just put it in one of them big envelopes  so I can mail it in and you can check it out.  Yeah, and just, like, label, you know, which is which.  All the different bushes that I've, uh, done?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  All right?  All right, mail it in there?  Should I put my name and any other experience?  Yeah, like, uh, yeah, put your name and a phone number and we can reach you.  So we'll take a look at your work and then we'll call you back.  It's going to be a pretty big piece of cardboard, though.  We're looking at, uh, you know, three feet by about three feet.  All right.  I don't know if that's going to run to mail, but...  All right, John?  Three foot.  Yeah, three foot by three foot.  Like a big, like one of the things from school, like construction paper, like the old pegs?  Yeah.  Can I fold it?  Oh, no, that affects the, uh, the foliage. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Actually.  Yeah.  Just find a big envelope.  All right.  If you want, you can bring it down personally and just, uh, go to the address on the ad there.  Okay.  All right?  All right, your name's John?  Yeah, just look for me.  All right, John.  All right, man.  All right, thanks a lot.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Come on.  I couldn't hold it in.  Come on.  That can't be real.  No way.  There's no way that could be real.  That was a put-on.  No one could be that stupid. 
[02:34:30]  If it, if that was real, we'd just talk to the stuporst man alive.  Bring on the next slut.  Daddy, can I suck on your candy?  Making teen nymphs.  Isn't this illegal?  Look what you did to me again.  There are people that think that you and I should be going to jail.  I thought we were just having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun right now.  Do they get ratings books in the present?  O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah, if you enjoyed it. 
[02:35:00]  We'll be guys.  Come on. </pre>
