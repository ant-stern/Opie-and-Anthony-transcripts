<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with repeated FEMA website announcements, immediately followed by the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in graphic sexual banter and discussions of bodily functions. They launched into a hyperbolic self-promotion of the show, dismissing conventional radio norms.  The conversation then shifted to Google Glass, its features, and potential uses/abuses,  leading to a tangent on watches and the redundancy of timekeeping devices in the smartphone era.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion of albums that had sold over 10 million copies, interspersed with more crude jokes and anecdotes. The hosts speculated on artists and albums,  mentioning "Mustard," a musician known for a viral "Creep" cover, and his struggles with homelessness and sobriety, considering inviting him as a guest.

The discussion then turned to celebrities – Steve Martin (his banjo playing), Alec Baldwin (his attempts to avoid recognition), and Jesse Jackson Jr. (his misuse of campaign funds).  They also revisited a previously discussed news reporter and recounted a weatherman's on-air blackout.  A promotional announcement for a new Mike Tyson daytime TV show, featuring snippets of potentially controversial and humorous content, concluded this segment.

The next segment began as a "Pearl Jam Day" segment that quickly devolved into an argument about the band's discography and sales. This transitioned into a discussion about massages, including one host's experience with a male masseuse. A significant portion focused on a news story about Laura Smith, a large woman denied a massage due to concerns about breaking the table.  The hosts engaged in calculations about her weight and fitness based on her half-marathon time.  This was followed by another discussion of the weatherman's blackout in a stunt plane, including graphic descriptions of his reaction to the G-forces, further enhanced by a caller with aviation expertise. This led to a broader conversation about gravity and astronauts, incorporating explanations from callers with physics backgrounds, including detailed discussions of orbital mechanics and weightlessness.  The segment concluded with a viral video of an angry Irish woman reacting to a soccer game with expletive-laden outbursts, prompting speculation on her age and the intensity of Irish soccer fandom.

The subsequent segment began with a comparison of soccer, American football, and baseball fanbases.  This transitioned into a discussion of violent online videos: a sniper being shot, a hat being blown off, and a man with a severe gunshot wound.  The hosts used highly offensive and derogatory language, repeatedly employing the phrase "Spanish cunt." They then discussed a photo initially believed to be a WWII image of soldiers under fire, later revealed to be a fake from a miniature war diorama, created by a man as therapy following a brutal assault. This led to a discussion of a video of young girls fighting, with their mothers encouraging them, sparking commentary on poor parenting and societal issues, particularly within the Black community.  Jimmy, a regular comedian guest, participated throughout, sharing personal anecdotes before departing for a Las Vegas comedy show. The segment included a humorous Black History Month bit featuring a rolling pin, a comedic “Uncle Paul” segment, more Pearl Jam discussion, and a segment about the documentary on the miniature war diorama creator.

Another segment opened with a discussion of a cancelled Van Halen reunion, speculating on the band members' animosity and alleged drug issues, followed by discussion of David Lee Roth's sexuality. This abruptly shifted to a graphic news story about a decomposing corpse found in a Los Angeles hotel's water tank, sparking discussion about negligence, potential foul play, and the implications for guests. This led to a tangent about Hollywood death stories and ghost tours.  The show then briefly returned to "Pearl Jam Day," before switching to other songs and discussions including a humorous segment on perceived homoeroticism in *Top Gun* (with a Quentin Tarantino clip), various viral videos (Sam Roberts doing the Harlem Shake, a baby with trick shots, a skilled Swedish punter), and a live read for a product masking the taste of oral sex. The segment concluded with discussion of Tom Papa's appearances at the Stress Factory and a comparison of *The Voice* judges.

The final excerpt focused on *The Voice*, including Christina Aguilera's replacement by Shakira (with crude descriptions of Aguilera's appearance), Blake Shelton's success, a caller’s discussion of a perceived pro-terrorist message in the lyrics of the Harlem Shake (which was disputed), internal radio station mishaps involving staff (described in vulgar language), listener opinions on Aguilera vs. Shakira, a story about Roland's disastrous interview with original MTV VJs, a caller's criticism of the show, and a detailed discussion of a fake Guy Fieri restaurant website with a humorous, vulgar menu.  Tom Papa appeared in-studio towards the end, contributing to discussions about his stand-up performances and other topics. The segment included multiple phone calls with varying levels of offensiveness.

I'm trying to wait for our music  What do you mean?  It's not the right song  It's not the right song?  Maybe it's the right song  But it's not the right  I like the Grimm and the Mourne 
[00:05:30]  Oh  I don't know if it's making it in or not though  I don't know if it's officially a Grimm in the Morning show  I hope so  I have no idea  He's out his way  Oh, okay  He's in the hall  That would have been silly to play that singer then  Yes, it would have been  Mars, why do you look so flustered?  I'm just checking my headphones  What happened?  I was just checking my headphones  Why?  You're not broadcasting?  I'm listening to your mic  Are you being hopeful? 
[00:06:00]  Are you hoping we invite you to do a little broadcasting?  No, man  You know I changed your mic and I'm just listening intently  Are you?  Yes  Nice  Good morning, Annie  Do you think Mars gets  Jesus, ten minutes  Ten minutes to go two blocks  What happened?  I hit every light  Kenny's not very good of a driver either  No, he's not  We're a person  What's going on?  He's not very attentive  What are you talking about?  Did he zone out when you're driving? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, he does  You have a stand?  Yeah, I drive with him  I told Kenny I don't want to drive with him anymore  Because he  Did you?  Yeah, he won't wear his glasses  And he's  He fucking  He just sometimes zones out  And then you're like  It's green  Yeah, that happened  What are you doing?  That happened just before  He zones out  He snoozes  Green light  He gets a couple snoozes in  Is that what that is?  He's just tired, you think?  Oh, I've had him fall asleep at green lights on the way in  I don't drive with him at five in the morning though  So I don't  I just deal with him  It's early though 
[00:07:00]  That's pretty crazy, yeah  That's like normal driving for that time  I'm just glad I come in here a little later  Because man, when I was coming in here like 4.30, 5 o'clock  That's when it's fucking ugly out there  It's scary  That's when we had the fender bender  He calls it, but I was horrified  Because he's seen some horrific things on the force  He thought it was a no big deal fucking accident  As this guy completely T-bones us  I jump out of the car like, what the fuck? 
[00:07:30]  And Kenny's like, oh, oh, oh  Little fender bender  Like a little fender bender?  He just ripped your whole fucking front bumper off  There are times I swear he's going to hit people in the crosswalks  Like he'll be making a turn  And there's someone in the crosswalk  And I'm like, holy fuck, he's going to hit that person  He just doesn't care  And aren't you always conscious of like  When a light's about to turn red or green or something  And you give it a little more gas 
[00:08:00]  When you see like, the don't walk is flashing on the other side  And you've got to, you know, go  And he just  Utter indifference  Oh, oh  Okay  Yep  Yellow, stop  No  No  What are you doing?  What a lunk  But it's fucking  And it's amazing  The braking system is  Drive, drive, drive  Stop  It's, it's, there's no  We deal with it going home in the day  But that's his personality  You just described his personality  On or off 
[00:08:30]  On or off  Stop, go, right  It's fucking, it makes me nauseous  No gray area  No  All right, what the fuck  Are we going to be wearing our computers?  Someone help me out with this fucking thing  Like loincloths?  I don't know  The Google Glasses  What the fuck's going on with the Google Glasses?  Everyone was talking about it yesterday  It's a good company to be involved with, Google  Fuck  Yeah, man  What's up?  Right now, they're a little out of our price range  I think you can pre-order  Wait, wait, what?  What'd you say?  A little out of my price range  There you go  Okay 
[00:09:00]  There you go  And sunglasses are out of your price range  You're getting a little too big for your britches  Or little fella  Ray-Bans  Getting a little too big for your britches, son  You can pre-  That's true  I mean, you can pre-order a $1,500 prototype  Well, I laugh at that  And what does it do?  Yeah  It's like glasses  But then there's a little camera  You see this square box up here?  I sure do  So you get a little picture-in-picture for your life  What do you put in the picture-in-picture? 
[00:09:30]  It could be  So I guess this  In this photo  You're communicating with your son  Right  Where's he, though?  He's wherever he is at home  Maybe on a computer  Right  And he gets to see what you see  Oh, this is great  More car accidents  Great  Wait, what you see?  Great  He can see what you can see?  So like you're looking at this  What if you're looking at some stripper's ass?  Yeah, exactly  And you're trying to put the dollar bill in a G-string  Can you turn this shit off?  Yeah, you can turn it  You have the option of  You don't want your son seeing everything 
[00:10:00]  Right  I would assume that most strip clubs will disallow Google glasses  Yeah?  What about GoPros?  Those would fall into the same category  They don't like video, you know  So what happens?  You see your son in the corner as you're walking around  And then what happens?  Well, it's like having FaceTime  See, you don't know  With you all the time  You know what FaceTime is  Yeah, but why would I want to do that?  He wouldn't want that either  I don't know 
[00:10:30]  Because you do it in glasses  The same reason why people think you want to have your phone on your watch  What else does it do, though?  I don't know  I was talking about watches the other day  What were you saying?  I put on a nice watch every once in a while  But it doesn't tell the correct time  Why don't you set it to tell the right time?  Because that's stupid  What do you mean?  Because we have our time on our phones now  Oh, so it's strictly a fashion accessory  Watch is decorative  Gotcha  Gotcha  You're not going to waste your time  No, if you took a poll right now  Most people don't fucking have the right time on their watches anymore 
[00:11:00]  So honestly, you're just wearing a bracelet  Yeah  Right  But it moves  A fancy bracelet  Yeah  This is magic  Yeah, but  This is fucking magic  I don't know if it's magic  Because Sam's not describing it properly  Yeah, it's  Something about FaceTime  I heard  I heard you can wear your computer  What's that about?  I don't know if it's a phone  You're not going to have a keyboard  Maybe not now you're not  But within a couple of years  That's what you're going to have  Glasses that you can just see your hard drive on  You walk around  Your son can see what you're looking at?  It's basically  This orange part right here 
[00:11:30]  And this glass part  How do I make a viral video?  It's like a two-way camera  Yeah  And that's what it is  It's only a camera though  But you're not seeing your hard drive  You can't do any work on it  Not yet  And what is that guy doing in that photo?  He's holding a snake  And his son is like  Holy shit, there's a snake  And he's like  I'm using both my hands on the snake  Why?  Oh, I see  You're missing a lot, I think  The kid is seeing what he sees straight on through his glasses 
[00:12:00]  It's not the same image in the corner  Yeah, are you trying to make this up as you go along?  No  It says right here  I'm looking at it  You can take photos  You can chat  Yeah  Search, navigate  I don't know what you navigate  See?  There are other things  That's wearing your computer  There are other things  You're making it seem like it's just a two-way fucking camera  I'm mad that you haven't done my reading for me  I could have easily read up on this 
[00:12:30]  I saw people talking about it all day yesterday  Alright, let's look at the video together  Alright, let's do that  Can we play it on the show?  You say take a picture, right?  Yep  I'll take a picture for you, no problem  I'll take it to my finger  Well, it's got voice commands  What if you have one of those horrendous Boston accents?  Then you may have to work on it  Will it recognize that you're saying take a picture?  Take a picture!  You could put your hands behind your head and say record a video  Why do you have to put your hands behind your head to do that? 
[00:13:00]  Hands free, I'm just saying you could if you want to  You're relaxing  Oh, I thought that's what you have to do  You don't have to  That would be silly, right?  Yeah, yeah  It wouldn't make any sense  You can share with your friends  So, so far it's just a camera on glasses  Yeah, who cares?  I could do that with my phone  How do you know?  I could pick up my phone  I could film you  And I could share it  It'll also have GPS  So, I got GPS on my phone  And it seems like that would be distracting  To have it literally on your eyeball  No, it's like a  It's like a heads up display  Still, I would be looking at the GPS 
[00:13:30]  Instead, it's a  You don't want a GPS on your windshield  Dude, you could say right now  Take a picture and send  It's fucking magic  It's, it's  You're thinking something  And you're just  Magic  And you're sending it  Without hitting any buttons  Even though you're saying it  Yeah  You're going send  And I guarantee it will send to someone  Yeah  With this close to fucking  Completely silent communication  Like fucking we pictured aliens having  Ooh  Damn  Right  Future Jimmy rules  Yes  Future Jimmy's scary  Future Jimmy always knows

[00:25:30]  Released 30 years later  Amazing  And half the fucking members  Probably weren't even alive  When it came out  And everybody has all those songs  Yeah you know  Oh quick  Where do I get  She loves to  Yeah yeah yeah  She loves to  What the fuck it's called  Oh no  Do you have a copy of  Sergeant Peppers?  I don't  I have 30 copies  Of every Beatles song  Yeah  Yeah I have it in fucking  Yeah but do you have it in  Certain orders  Dude I have  Little Beatles figurines  That will stand on my shoulders  And sing it to me  They come up with a new order  Of how the song should be played 
[00:26:00]  And then everyone has to  Buy that version  Oh okay  Oh yeah Britney Spears  Britney Spears  Oops I did it again  10.4 million  Damn  She just made the cut  Oh  Oh I got the list right here  I should have looked  Really?  Lincoln Park  Oh that's not a surprise  Lincoln Park was a monster band  For a while  10 million  And they're still doing it  Oof  I don't know  I wouldn't  That's a surprise  No not at all  Think of all the bands  In the 2000s though  That kind of  Lincoln Park  Was a monster band 
[00:26:30]  For a while  You forget  You just don't think of them  In those terms  That album had so many  Fucking songs on it  What's one song  I mean I know them  But I don't know any of their  What do you got off  Hybrid theory there  E-Rock  By the  The Lincoln Park boys  Oh Eric  Oh E-Rock  Did he get it?  No  What's he doing?  I don't know  I mean E-Rock put the  Music bed on yesterday  For a commercial  That didn't exist  It didn't exist  Oh really?  Yeah  And then it took him like  10 seconds to realize it 
[00:27:00]  And go back to  Oh boy  Yeah  It was not good  No  Yeah remember this  Fucking song  I do remember it  I never would have thought  They did  They did some of that shit  And then they killed  Rock rap  Yeah  Oh they did rock rap  Thank god  No no no  I never  I don't know why  It doesn't even matter  How hard you try  This was a huge song  Is this Limp Bizkit?  It sounds like  They were even Eminem  No they were 
[00:27:30]  They were doing  Yeah  They were the leaders  In this fucking genre  Eminem was  Is on that list too  That doesn't surprise me  Is that Marshall Mathers?  Yeah he sold 12 million  That's a great fucking record  Alright what else is on the list?  Uh  I don't know  Shania Twain  Shania Twain  Oh  This is one of those  Bullshit ones though  Why?  She sold 5.8 million  But it was a double album  So they count it twice  What?  It's bullshit  Why would they do that?  That's what they always do 
[00:28:00]  If you have a double album  Yeah  Each sale counts twice  That's ridiculous  That's so cheating  So let's get rid of Shania Twain  What if you put out  A 10 million album set  Right?  And it sells one copy  You just buy it yourself  And then  Do you get it though?  You get it  Is it 10 million?  That counts  Oh that's cool  Do it that way then  You gotta have a 10 million  Oh jeez  Chip's looking at me  Very angrily  Like he doesn't agree  Fucking genius  Oh well  I thought you were gonna yell at me  Nora Jones  Laura Jones 
[00:28:30]  10.8 million  That's surprising  Oh look who  Showed up twice on the list  The Eminem Show  Yes  That's a great one  I liked that album  That's great  I wore that one out  Is that the one with  Yes it is  White America  White America's on there  It's not my favorite song on the record  But strictly business probably  There better be a Metallica album on this list  Metallica  Black album  Yeah  Nine  Outkast  Outkast  Outkast 
[00:29:00]  That was a  Oh but that was another one  It was a double album  Alright so we  Knock him off the list too  Cheat  Outkast  Suck my meat  What  And he said  Knock him off the outkast  There's two of them  Yeah  We had one  Who we had  We had Andre 3000  Yeah  We had Andre 4000  And then Andre 5000  And Confessions  Is the last one  Usher  But I'll tell you  Usher cheated too  You know how Usher cheated  Wow  It's a ten album assessment  Yes 
[00:29:30]  He re-released the album  With like three new tracks  Yeah  And then everybody  Who bought it twice  That counts  It's the same album  That's stupid  I got the list actually  Since 1991  Metallica's self-titled  Release  Moved  15.86 million copies  God damn  Shania Twain's on the list  Jagged Little Pill  We forgot  Oh man  Alanis Morissette  Yeah  14.82 million fucking copies  Oh  Then you got the Backstreet Boys  They did 12.2 
[00:30:00]  2.1 million  What about Nevermind  Nevermind  That fell short I think  Yeah  Yeah  The Bodyguard soundtrack's on the list  Yeah  Santana's Supernatural  Holy fuck  With Rob Thomas  With that massive hit  There were a few hits on that album  And Grown Ups bought that album  That sold 11.73 million copies  Oh my god  Creed is on the list  Creed  Are you kidding me  Everyone loves to hate Creed  Yeah  Meanwhile they sell  They're the Guy Fieri of music 
[00:30:30]  Is that the  Arms Wide Open  Yep  Which one  I don't know  Give them Arms Wide Open  It's inspiring  A few bands sounded like Pearl Jam back then  That's  They did 11.64 million  Bob Marley and the Wailers  Legend did 11  Plus million  That's  He's got this affected voice  Yeah  I think I've heard this though  I think  I would assume so  Oh my god  It's a lot like  B-Rock's  Mouth Wide Open 
[00:31:00]  Oh yeah  I've heard this  You would swear that's any better  If you were from another planet  Yeah  If you didn't know the song  I don't like that style of singing  No  I love it  Begin to pray  Begin to pray  Why is it  It's so affected right  It's terrible  I wish I liked it  Everyone sings like this  He's high enough  He wants to come in man 
[00:31:30]  I don't know what to tell him  Because I know you hate him  No tell him  Come in  No tell him to come in  He fucking writes me all the time  And I'm like  I don't know what to say to the guy  Oh I have to come in  I love mustard  He's going down in the  He's homeless  Yeah man  He's going down to the music thing  In Austin  South by Southwest  Yeah man  He's doing well  Does he have a home?  I don't know  Because if he's still homeless  That's fucking bullshit  He's kind of in between  He's in one of those places  Is he sober?  Is he crazy?  Yeah last time I ran into him  I filmed a little something with him 
[00:32:00]  Down near the comedy cellar  Yeah  They were putting together  A little documentary  For the South by Southwest  Music Festival  And I did a little something for that  And he performed a new song for me  And he seemed very sober  Yes  How was his new song?  Pretty good  I bet  So called Vanity Plate  I bet fucking  That homeless thing  Is a great selling gimmick  For his music  He looks healthy  He's probably like  I can get it home  I can  But right now  It's probably not good  Career wise 
[00:32:30]  To have a home  A guy with a house  Sings incredible version of Creep  Who cares?  It's not the same as homeless guy  Amazing right?  No he's doing well  People  He has fans all over the world now  Because of this dumb show  And that dumb video  And he told me a story man  He wanted to get sober  And a couple people  Took advantage of him  Like he was starting to get  Kind of some crazy fame  From that Creep video  Now that video is up to  I think like 11 million views  It's ridiculous  Wow  It still does like 
[00:33:00]  About 60 to 70 thousand views a month  Without us even talking about it  It's a fucking monster  And he said that  Some people  Took advantage of him  And offered him a place to stay  In Minnesota  But they had no interest  In keeping him sober  Oh really?  And you know  He was a weak man obviously  And you know  I'm weak!  What do you mean  They had no interest  In keeping him sober?  Did he  He went there  Under the guise  That they were going to help him  Oh okay  They gave him a place to stay  It was a nice place 
[00:33:30]  And the first night  They got there  They went out drinking  And he went under the guise  That you know  I'm going to a place  That'll help me out  A little bit  Uh huh  So and then you know  He went with that for a while  And then  He got the fuck out of there  He knew it was just  A bad fucking joint  To be in  So  How many views?  Wow  Yeah 10.6  Six and change  It's a good version of the song  I mean I don't  Who sings Creep originally?  Radiohead  Radiohead  He wants to come in 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  You want him in?  I got his email right here  Sure  You're going to be nice to him in  Oh hells yeah  Let's hear it for a second  Can we hear it for a second?  Dude man  Hope you're well  Headed down to Austin, Texas  For South by Southwest Music Festival  On March 12th  Pretty cool  Since they only let a select few acts in  And they picked little old me  Doing an official showcase  Which means hopefully  There will be a lot of industry  And labeled people in attendance  The festival is apparently known  For discovering artists  As always  I would jump at the chance 
[00:34:30]  To do some songs on the show  Or do a video or anything with you  Anytime  I was going to do a video or two  Promoting the South by Southwest show  With my producers  He's got producers now  Producers  If I sent you the video  Do you think you can post it  On your YouTube channel  It's just that you have  Such a bigger reach  And more subscribers  Than little old me  Again hope you are well  And thanks for everything  Pretty much getting  Me to this point  Peace  Yeah he's fucking  Really appreciative  Well  I would assume so  So 
[00:35:00]  He should be  Let's get him on  I want to hear just a second  Of the song  I've only watched  Moments of it  Oh  This thing's three years old already  Wow  Don't do it  I want to hear you in front  It's great  It goes  It's great 
[00:35:30]  It's great  You're in my eyes  You're like a father  It's gonna make me cry  You're just like an angel  You're beautiful  You're so fucking special  I wish I was special 
[00:36:00]  But I'm a creep  I'm a widow  What the hell am I doing here  When I don't belong here  It's okay  All right 
[00:36:30]  So let's have him come in  And get an update on the guy  Sure  I'm game  Are you?  Sure  For real?  Yeah  I don't mind the mustard  I like the mustard  I do  It's just not my style  Of vocal technique  That's all  What's your style?  I don't know  I'm more of a melodic  Kind of a guy  That's a little  Well that's gritty  A little gritty 
[00:37:00]  Yes gritty  Well he was up all night  I think he hit his head  He fucking was in the hospital  He was in jail  All in one night  And came in here without sleep  And still drunk  They're wacky  Jesus of course he's gritty  What the fuck?  A little gritty  Jeez  What else is going on?  So we did the Pearl Jam  Oh  Iraq  Yes  You had said earlier  When talking about  Steve Martin's banjo stuff  Did they do a version of King Tut?  Yeah  They did  Oh my god  Did we hear that? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah  Banjo King Tut?  Hold on to your hats kids  Why'd you get so funky?  Can I ask Jim Norton something  Before we play this?  Was that ever a good  Bit?  Because it was a huge song  A huge bit for Steve Martin  Monster  Was it kind of hack  In the comedy world  You think?  No  I mean honestly  I think that  He's a very respected comic  Like Pryor loved him  Pryor thought he called him a genius  He was a very  Very respected comic  And you look back on it  It's kind of  It's silly  And a little hokey 
[00:38:00]  But at the time  I remember loving it  And everybody loved it  No one made fun of it  No  It was huge  No one's talked about it  Ironically  People loved it  Got a lot of radio play too  Yeah  You think?  Oh man  When you heard  Oh turn it up  It's King Tut  I don't hate it  I just don't like  I don't like the  Is it your favorite  Egyptian song?  It's um  No Bangles  Yeah I like the one  I do like the Bangles  It's always between those two  I think  Yeah  Between those two  Name a third one  They played it in my social studies class 
[00:38:30]  To teach us about King Tut  Which one?  In sixth grade  Steve Martin?  Yeah  A condo made of stoner?  What?  Ew  Really?  My social studies teacher put it on  And did you roll your stupid eyes?  Well my eyes weren't stupid  But I did roll my eyes  The same way you did  I say your stupid eyes  Because it wasn't hip hop enough for you?  It was sixth grade  It was almost hip hop though  There's almost a little hip hop feeling  You just said it was dumb now  So why wouldn't I in sixth grade  Have thought it was dumb? 
[00:39:00]  King Tut  See  We can't have mustard  How'd you get so funky?  See you couldn't help himself  Funky Tut  Can it do the monkey?  See we can't have man  What?  We can't have man  I knew it  I knew it  You can't help yourself  Love the mustard  You can't help yourself  No I swear I'll help myself  You can't help yourself  I'll help myself  Which is endearing  For this radio show  But you can't help yourself  I will help myself  I swear  You show like moments of having a soul  And then you push it deep down  Why? 
[00:39:30]  Why do I do it?  I don't know  It is scary though  To show your soul  I know it is  Rip that chest open  And just show everybody  What you're made of  It's the most frightening thing ever  In the world ever  Can you pocket tweet with Google Glass?  That's a very good question  Right now you can't tweet with it  Well if you're wearing them  And you lay down  And you roll over onto your face  Right  I bet you can  Are you talking in your sleep?  Yeah right  There you go  Tweet whatever 
[00:40:00]  And the reporter that talked to Scott Brown  Up there in Massachusetts  Uh huh  What is he  He used to be a senator  Governor  What the fuck  Senator  Senator  And he is claiming he was pocket tweeting  Yeah  That reporter is very excited  That we talked about her  Oh really?  Seems like she might be a fan of the show  Because someone brought it to her attention  That we were talking about it  And she tweeted something like  Oh my god that is so cool  Wow  Some reporter from Fox 25  She's a looker too man  Has Jimmy been blocked yet by Scott Brown? 
[00:40:30]  Why?  Have you?  On Twitter?  No  I stopped  I just tweeted him yesterday morning  And then stopped  Why is he blocking people?  I did a pocket  I did a pocket pool joke  Did you?  To him  Pocket pool  I was asking him if he was doing something  Playing some pocket pool  Yes  I bantered him a little bit  Yeah a little bit  That's what made me laugh  I was just wondering if he had seen that  And then blocked you  Oh I don't know  I doubt it  Political figures  Guys like that  Rarely block you 
[00:41:00]  Because they see it as like  Well I have to hear  You know  They just don't want the flack from blocking  They might put you on mute or something  Right  I want to hear the King Tut version on Bluegrass  Oh  Yeah let's do this E-Rod  And Joe Tut  Come on Eric  Stop fudging around  I'm going to cancel  Oh god  Yeah  Look at the crowd  Like oh  I know this  Game Tut  Oh man  Game Tut  Now when he was a young boy  He never thought 
[00:41:30]  Oh he sings  People stand in line  To see the boy king  Game Tut  How'd you get so funky  Bunky Tut  Did you do the funky  Born in Arizona  Who moved to Babylonia  Game Tut  I don't get it  Why is it born in Arizona  If I'd known  Then line up just to see him  Yeah  I'd taken all my money  And bought me a museum  Game Tut  Buried with a donkey  Monkey Tut 
[00:42:00]  What?  He's my favorite honky  Born in Arizona  Who moved to Babylonia  Game Tut  Alright enough  Alright enough  There's nothing going on there  Tut  Tut  Tut  Tut  Yuck  Any other Egyptian songs  We should be exploring today  What like an Egyptian  That's it  And then  There's gotta be a third  Yeah  There has to be  Oh love Sphinx 
[00:42:30]  Love Sphinx  That's a good one  That is a good one  Yeah that's good  Oh that's not gonna do it  Well if you put it in Egyptian songs  It's just music from Egypt  Right  That's pretty much all you're gonna get  Yeah  Yes  Stupid song stuck in my head  Born in Arizona  Moved to Babylonia  Game Tut  At least it got Electric Barbarella 
[00:43:00]  Out of my head  What?  Or why the hell  That was stuck in my head  For fucking ever  Why?  I don't know  Duran Duran  Electric Barbarella  Was stuck in my head  Was that a good song?  Electric Barbarella  Da da da da  What?  I like that  When did this come out?  90s  Was it the 90s?  Do you know this one?  Sure it was the 90s?  Yeah  What in the 80s?  This doesn't sound like  This is what shows up 
[00:43:30]  Electric Barbarella  Duran Duran  Yeah  Alright  Yeah  I thought this was a  I think it was like an 89 to 90  Yeah  Is there a year on this?  The video looks very 80s  Come on  I hear this come out  It's probably late 80s  Early 90s  Lightbeats  Remember this song? 
[00:44:00]  I don't remember this song  No?  To be completely honest  Maybe the chorus  You remember  The chorus was stuck  In my fucking head  No?  Uh uh uh  This is 97  No way  Yeah  This was playing at PLJ  When I was there  Yeah  Really?  This is from 1997  This part is back in my head  And this was stuck in your head? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah  Holy fuck  I don't even know the song  Really?  No  It looks like 97  Yeah  It kind of does now  That I'm looking at the video  Wow that girl's hot though  Thumbs up on Duran Duran?  I fucking love Duran Duran  You like the one?  I'm willing to go out  I'm willing to go out on a limb  And say it  You like the one where he's like  Avenue  Ordinary World?  Yeah that one  I like that one  Avenue  Avenue  Do you play Ordinary World? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know this one though  I don't know why it was stuck in my head  Was it made for a movie or anything?  I don't know  No I think it was a reunion project  Was it?  Yeah  I like this faggoty one right here  They have their fast songs  And then their slower songs  Well this was the big comeback song  Yeah  Made them huge again  There's a version of this  They did with Pavarotti  It was really good  Really?  Who sings this?  Duran Duran  What year was this? 
[00:45:30]  62  Yeah 1962 I believe  Wow  Yep  We're ahead of their time  Yep right before the Beatles  They came out with this  Oh wow  The Beatles said fuck  We gotta do something here man  Duran Duran's kicking our ass  This is a good tune right?  I like their unique harmonies  He's got a unique voice  Yeah  Let me hear the Pavarotti thing  Instead of just talking about it  It's online  They did it for a charity benefit  Exactly  Really?  I hate Pavarotti  I don't appreciate that shit  My father got into a Pavarotti phase 
[00:46:00]  Where he would listen to that shit  In the house all the time  Oh my god really?  Alright let me hear this  This is a good tune  There's Duran Duran  Coming out with Pavarotti  Is it?  What year is this?  95  Holy shit really?  Remember he used to travel  With his own toilet?  Yep  Big fat fuck  Oh it's only Pavarotti  It's not the other guy too?  No it's supposed to be him  And Simon LeBond  Yeah they walked out  He's there  Oh no I meant the guy  From the three tenors 
[00:46:30]  No  There was Pavarotti  No  Well with the orchestra playing  This is crazy  Now is this a Duran Duran show?  Pavarotti show  This was a charity benefit  Oh oh okay  Sorry  Killing from the rain  Pavarotti's laughing  At the sun on the bottom  Oh no that's a cute little voice  You got there  Let me show you what I can do  Nice wispy voice  He got there  Yeah right 
[00:47:00]  Sounds like he's singing  Out of his asshole  Why would you do this?  Pavarotti's gonna kick your ass  Yeah here it comes  Pavarotti's voice will give you chills  Even though I'm not a fan  Uh oh  What has happened to it all  Crazy  The bottom's got a good  Fucking voice man  Yeah  Where is the life  Look at Pavarotti  That I recognize  He's right on key man  I'm not a way 
[00:47:30]  But I won't cry for yesterday  There's an ordinary world  Somehow I have to find  That's Pavarotti doing  Just holding the fucking lyrics  That's what Sylvain's wondering  He keeps looking over him at him  When are you gonna take it fat boy?  They're here to see you  Not me  Oh here we go  Uh oh man  Uh oh  Another orchestra going at it 
[00:48:00]  They must be like  What's this dribble?  Uh oh  This is a wolfman beard  Wow  He's harmonizing with him  There he goes 
[00:48:30]  There he goes.  Jesus.  For real, got chills.  Simon LeBond just turned into the bitch. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  I hate to be his upstairs neighbor.  You hear that fatso bell in the shower every day.  You're trying to sleep.  8 in the morning.  Hang on, look.  That was very good.  That is good. 
[00:49:30]  Holy fuck.  Wow.  I got chills when I started singing.  Did he not speak English?  I guess he sang it in Italian.  Yeah.  Well, that's his thing.  I don't know.  No, he spoke English a little bit.  Sam's laughing.  I think it's funny.  Isn't it funny, Sam?  Yeah.  You're a culturalist pig.  He really could have built out a tune, couldn't he? 
[00:50:00]  That big fucking blip.  You know what that must have sounded like there?  With the fucking orchestra?  That's huge.  That sound is huge.  If I was Pavarotti, all I would have done was singing elevators really loud.  Just to get compliments.  You know how much fucking money he must have got for a gig?  Yeah, that's probably a lot, right?  Maybe fucking 50, 60 bucks?  Oh, see, I would have thought higher. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, perhaps.  What year did he die?  That was great.  Pretty recently.  Yeah.  No, I bet you no.  I bet you no.  Oh, no.  I know.  He's not moved at all.  That's the amazing thing.  He's pretty old in that video.  He just stands there.  That's 95.  I bet you he barely made it to...  I'm going to go with...  I'm going to go with 2002.  2000?  I'm going to go 5, 2005. 
[00:51:00]  7, 2007.  Wow.  How old was he?  Way off.  Did his obesity kill him?  Obesity.  Obesity.  Yeah.  Remember the video of Ecstasy of the Gold?  Where they're doing it live.  Yeah.  Sergio Leone.  And the woman is wearing red and singing.  It's fucking chilling.  But she doesn't move.  Yeah.  Opera people can just stand there.  They don't have to rock out.  They don't.  They don't have to tilt their neck to get the notes out.  They don't at all.  No, it's amazing.  I bet you that would affect your performance. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  La la la la la.  Ooh.  Like, where is it coming from?  The mannequin?  Fuck.  Did Pavarotti do any more?  Girls on film.  Girls on film.  The reflex is on it.  No?  See, I told you Pavarotti singing Duran Duran is funny.  The whole collection.  You're right.  The whole collection.  Her name is Rio and she dances on the song. 
[00:52:00]  That's pretty cool.  A lot of culture this morning, man.  Yes.  I didn't know I was going to talk about Pavarotti today.  We don't know where we're going.  How old was he?  He was a month shy of 72.  That's old for a fat fuck, but that's not like...  It is?  That's not old.  You should have delivered the eulogy.  It's old for a fat fuck, but we're here to talk about this fat piece of shit.  Yeah, stop crying.  That's old for a fat fuck.  Yes.  Bring his own toilet.  I'm sure that would have calmed down his family. 
[00:52:30]  Who had to carry the toilet?  Like, who was in charge of doing, like, unplugging that, unscrewing that?  Brr!  Brr!  The guy who was in charge of the toilet would always hate and say, what's Luciano doing  tonight?  Oh, they're going out to Chili's.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  He's got a tough day in the morning.  Put your face right over the bowl where it's fucking warm.  It's still warm from his fat asshole.  Oh, my God.  Fat, hairy asshole.  Oh, those toilet skid marks.  Yes.  Probably in there. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Looks like fucking Willy Wonka's living room walls.  There's duty on us.  You think Club Soda Kenny would have done that job?  I don't know.  He would have been Pavarotti's toilet guy.  He would have just dozed off in the middle of the...  Oh.  I think we should eat.  Our food's getting fucking cold.  I have to plug something.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to be in Vegas at the MGM tomorrow and Saturday.  With Dave.  With Dave Attell.  That's a great little show, man.  But today at 10 a.m., my tickets for Summerville go on sale.  Well, March 29th, I'm shooting... 
[00:53:30]  It's a new one-hour special, and I shoot it in Somerville, Massachusetts at the Somerville  Theater, and I'm expecting it will sell out.  It's Friday, March 29th.  Right on.  Two shows.  For you.  When we get back, you got the cruise passengers.  They are suing.  Of course.  Sue everyone.  Punitive damage is here.  Yeah, they're not...  I can't say I blame them.  They're not accepting what Carnival's offering.  Isn't there some kind of law on the high seas you can't sue or something?  Yeah, but Carnival's still have to pay to litigate them.  It might be a loophole, though, because instead of taking them back to, I think it was Galveston? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, Galveston!  They decided to take them all the way to Mobile, and that could have fucked up the little contract  everyone signed.  Oh!  That's what one of the lawyers is saying.  A loophole, then.  And the reason why they went to Mobile is because they knew they could fix the ship in Mobile.  Oh!  So, Carl McCruise was like, well, fuck all these people.  Yeah, obviously it would be easier to go to Galveston, but we need to get our ship fixed.  So, let's just go right to Mobile. 
[00:54:30]  That's what I kind of heard last night on the news.  Yeah!  Then you got Jesse Jackson Jr.  What a piece of shit.  Yeah.  And the news is calling him, you know, brilliant, and he still has a chance to be an amazing leader.  Stop!  What the fuck?  He's a criminal.  He absolutely is a criminal.  The list of things.  Oh, amazing.  Campaign funds pushing a million dollars.  Over $750,000 from campaign funds he used for personal use.  Who's still saying he could fucking be a... 
[00:55:00]  The news was all about it this morning.  Are you kidding me?  Un-fucking-believable.  He's buying Michael Jackson's guitar and all sorts of shit.  By the news, you mean...  With campaign funds.  MSNBC?  Might have been MSNBC.  Maybe, yeah.  But they're still talking like, you know, he could get through this.  No fucking...  And get back on track and be, you know, that great leader he was born to be.  This is supposed to be a career-ending fucking...  Not a politics!  Ah, amazing. 
[00:55:30]  A lot of these guys make the big comeback.  But he could go to jail for, what, five years or so?  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  And then the CBS anchor, that story's got legs.  CBS!  What's his name?  Morrison?  Rob Morrison, I think.  Jim?  Yes.  No hotel, it's his first name.  We got the update on him.  He quit yesterday.  Yeah.  He says he has anxiety.  Well, there's a lot of shit going on with that story.  Makes you, uh, choke your fucking chick.  Then he's not supposed to be drinking, and he's in a bar drinking with a Post reporter there. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, right.  Right after he resigned, he went to a bar, right?  And slammed back a few.  How is that front-page news in the Post, but Jesse Jackson Jr., an elected official, admitting three-quarters of a million dollars is not...  It's not, uh, it's not, uh, you know, saucy enough.  Bias media.  Of course.  Yeah.  But this is the Post.  They tend to stay more conservative.  No, man.  You know, they know a good choking story will... 
[00:56:30]  Trump's any fucking...  Blade Gunner.  Oh, I get it.  Like Runner.  Right.  That guy's so guilty.  Oh, God, yeah.  And we could say that, because we have nothing to do with their laws.  He's very far away.  Go ahead, try to do...  That guy is so guilty.  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's like saying, like, Ahmadinejad is a complete liar.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  And he's gay.  There.  Sue me.  Like peckers. 
[00:57:00]  We also got the weatherman blacking out.  That video is hilarious.  I think most people have seen it by now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we'll go through it a little bit.  All right.  And then we got an obesity story as well.  Obesity.  A good obesity story on the way.  This is the Opioid Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM. 
[00:57:30]  For some patients, the ability to communicate is not an option.  A lookover would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  But one man is about to change their lives forever.  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill who live in darkness.  What the fuck is that?  Dr. Anthony Cumia.  Who said that?  Has found a way to bring light to the remaining days on Earth.  Your ass talked to me.  Using a rare gift he never knew he had.  Oh, my God.  What have I done? 
[00:58:00]  He'll learn to love those he never knew existed.  I think I know what you're going for.  You're going for sexy.  You're coming off as whiny.  O&A pictures.  What a hot voice that is.  And depends on their garments.  I love it.  Present a true story.  You're an ass.  Of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart.  You're talking out your ass.  The Ass Whisperer.  Coming soon.  Oh, stop it.  To the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:58:30]  Coming this fall.  Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike.  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina.  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind.  And hosts his own daytime TV show.  Giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Everybody knows.  You stick with your ex even though you break up until you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my badim.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man. 
[00:59:00]  I ain't eat, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you.  Fucking do it.  Yeah.  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side.  Yes, sir.  My addiction is too precarious for your comprehension.  I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly.  Yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga.  Booga, booga.  Weekday afternoons this fall.  It's Mike.  Woo.  Hosted by Mike Tyson. 
[00:59:30]  What do you say, champ?  What?  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't think Travis is going to approve of this one, Iraq.  It is Pearl Jam Day, though.  Hit it.  Freezing, rest his head on a pillow.  There he is, bro.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, feeling.  Maybe he'll see a little better.  Saturday's a...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, head down.  Face is at his seat, stomach and anything for me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  He can't help when he's happy.  He looks insane.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain. 
[01:00:30]  Evenflow.  Yeah, just trying to get to the hook for the people.  Evenflow.  Did the Evenflow Bottle Company ever use this as a...  What's the Evenflow Bottle Company?  Isn't there Evenflow, like the baby bottles?  There was one called Evenflow.  Wait, I'm a parent.  No?  I don't know this shit.  Maybe that's like old school.  Might be.  Yeah.  Let Travis pick the next one, E-Rock. 
[01:01:00]  You were way too conservative there.  Yeah.  Sorry I didn't go deep enough on a 10 million plus selling album.  Whoa!  I'd say play everything from this album.  And E-Rock.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Well, that was the whole point of Pearl Jam Day.  Jesus.  No, Pearl Jam Day is expansive.  What the fuck?  It's based on the fact that 10 is the 20 whatever the fuck album to sell over 10 million copies.  Well, you did not clarify that.  Whoa!  Whoa!  You know what?  This is out of control. 
[01:01:30]  What an argumentative guy.  Yeah.  Christ.  Man.  Are you in a bad mood or something?  No, I'm fine.  Jesus.  Skip second breakfast?  You're fine.  Fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Nailed it.  I'm going to go with a day on that one.  D-A-Y-U-M.  You're biting the bulldozer that feeds you.  So much food.  My head can't do it.  You know, this leads us to our obesity.  How do you say it? 
[01:02:00]  Obesity?  Obesity.  Obesity.  We got a great obesity story today.  Who likes a massage in this room?  Oh.  You know what, Ope?  I tend to enjoy one.  Yeah.  I like a good massage every once in a while.  Ant, do you ever get a massage?  I never get a massage.  Why?  It's nice, man.  What's wrong with you?  The only time I like being touched is sexually.  Actually.  Just to fucking lay there and have someone touch you?  It's great.  A man?  No.  I love it. 
[01:02:30]  No.  What the fuck, dude?  I know.  Keep that to yourself.  Well, no, because sometimes when you go to a masseuse.  I've had a man.  Wow.  I've had a man.  It's a little awkward.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Best massage, hotel.  But they know how to fucking rub out some muscle links, though.  Do they?  Yeah.  But it's weird.  Work on that hamstring.  And it's not weird because I'm getting feelings or any of that shit.  It's just weird.  I can't relax.  I can't relax.  Hotel.  Hotel.  Huh?  That's George Costanza when he was getting a massage by a man. 
[01:03:00]  I would prefer a lady.  Yeah?  I was in a spa with my girlfriend once, and there was two masseuses left.  Like a guy and a girl.  So I said, let her have the woman.  So I don't have to worry about her getting hit on.  Mm.  You took the bullet.  Nice.  I think she was in the room.  I think it was a couple's massage.  And this guy, he was in a Connecticut spa.  He ripped.  It's probably the best.  I wouldn't let him do legs or anything.  I said he had to do back.  He ripped my fucking back up. 
[01:03:30]  The next day, I requested him again.  I never had to do that.  Came back for more, did you?  I fell for him a little bit.  Oh.  Yes.  He had me at shiatsu.  Oh, we got a massage slash fat story for everybody.  Yes.  Laura Smith trains with a running group for a half marathon in May.  Looking at her?  No, she doesn't. 
[01:04:00]  Uh-uh.  Yes.  The Ops has spent a lot of years doing road work.  It's obvious.  Thank you, Jim Norton.  Thank you.  That lady is not doing road work.  What is this really about?  I like the sign with her weight on it behind her.  3.02.  3.02.  3.02.  She did a half marathon in three hours?  Let's do the math.  That doesn't seem too good.  She drove, though.  Oh.  How many miles is a half marathon?  13.1.  What are all the ribbons on her for?  She's a pig. 
[01:04:30]  4-H.  4-H.  All her county fair wins.  Yeah.  Do the math.  Okay.  Sorry.  You're asking me to.  All right.  So what's it?  10-minute miles, 13 miles.  That's 130 minutes.  That's two hours and 10 minutes.  Yeah.  So that's not great.  And then there's another hour after that, more or less.  So you're adding on a third?  You could almost walk that. 
[01:05:00]  Can't you do a 10-minute mile walking?  You can, right?  No.  So what is she training for?  10-minute miles is running.  No, it's not.  Well, it's at least jogging, especially if your thighs keep rubbing together like that.  Yeah, true.  That's the people down there who do the math.  She did a half marathon, 13.1 miles, and three hours and two minutes and change.  Yeah.  Give me a ballpark figure, please.  Hi, Kenny.  How are you?  Hey, Kenny.  People can walk three or four miles per hour. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, that's between 15 and 20 minutes a mile.  Okay, so three to four miles per hour.  Three, yeah, so four, say.  So that's 12.  Yeah.  Someone's got it done for you already.  You got some math people.  27.97.  14, 15 minutes a mile.  14 or 15 minutes a mile.  Yeah, that's walking.  Oh!  Yeah, so she, what is she, thank you.  My point is, she's not training for anything. 
[01:06:00]  No.  She's doing what a human could do, walk.  That's pretty amazing, considering she's a fucking sea mammal.  She's a whale.  Laura Smith trains with a running group for a half marathon in May, but she couldn't run  away fast enough from a painful situation last month.  I planned it specifically for the day after my marathon, because I knew I'd be hurting.  She just completed a half marathon in Arizona, and couldn't wait for a massage at Natural  Healing Center.  She moved to Babylonia. 
[01:06:30]  And couldn't wait, but they spell it W-E-I-G-H-T.  Oh, boy.  And wait for a massage at Natural Healing Center.  She, the doctor, comes out, and she says, I'm sorry, but you're too fat for our tables.  You're going to probably break a table, and then you'd have to pay for it.  All right, so what's the problem?  All right.  That seems like a real thing.  How much does she weigh?  Maybe 250?  And did she say fat?  Or did she say, you know, your weight?  She's got to pump it up for the lawsuit.  Yeah.  I'm actually on the side of the fat lady on this one. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  She's going to break the table.  I don't believe she...  I would believe that, but at 250, your massage table can't support a two...  That's like saying if a fucking linebacker went in, they couldn't massage him?  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  I'm looking...  You know what it is?  She's not terribly obese.  People would disgust.  They don't want to touch her.  She probably is fucking, you know...  She probably didn't shower for the marathon.  Oh, my God.  Got to get a hand in that crack.  Yeesh. 
[01:07:30]  ...out, and she says, I'm sorry, but you're too fat for our tables.  You're going to probably break a table, and then you'd have to pay for it.  And I was, like, in shock.  Like, I'm hearing this.  She left the center in tears.  She couldn't understand.  She's six foot three and had massages even before.  She'd lost 47 pounds to drop...  Wait, she's 6'3"?  What a monster.  Did they say she's 250 pounds?  Yeah, I think I read that.  I don't...  She looks bigger than 250 pounds if she's 6'3".  6'3", yeah.  Oh, maybe, okay.  Hold on a minute.  Let's do some research. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  She said she lost almost 50 pounds to put her at 250 pounds.  So, yeah, it says that she's 250 pounds.  That is not unreasonably...  That's fat, but that's not, like, fucking monsters.  But 6'3 is pretty tall for massage tables.  Maybe, but they weren't saying you won't fit.  They're saying you'll break it.  Just put her on the floor.  Exactly.  Oh, massage her on the fucking floor.  Just put her on the beach.  Throw water on her while you massage her.  Massages even before.  She'd lost 47 pounds to drop to about 250. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, I'm not tiny.  I know that, but I'm working on it.  Penny Wells, the owner of Natural Healing, wouldn't talk on camera, but she says she called  Smith large, not fat, and she worried a table might collapse because one had broken under  a 165-pound man.  I honestly expected to have some kind of a phone call.  A balsa wood table over there?  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, who are you in the side of that?  Yeah, who are you in the side?  It's a massage for progeria children.  I believe she didn't call her fat, but the other side of it, that 165-pound man broke 
[01:09:00]  a table?  Yeah.  Maybe.  That's crazy.  Maybe the therapist was on the table with the guy, or maybe the table is a piece of  shit.  Yeah, right.  65-pound man.  I honestly expected to have some kind of a phone call or something from them, you know,  just to say, wow, we're really sorry.  We didn't know it came across that way or something, but nothing.  And Smith says she's still waiting to get that massage.  I don't think I want a massage there, though.  Oh, good nature. 
[01:09:30]  It's true.  She should get massaged in mud by a farmer.  Oh, the poor lady.  What are we doing?  Who cares?  Fire.  Exactly.  We're blaming the victim.  Yeah.  Fire.  I don't think she was called fat, though.  No, I believe she wasn't either, but I don't think that that's...  That's not unreasonable to be 6'3 and 250 and want a massage.  Is she suing?  Yeah.  Is she?  Yeah.  Everyone sues.  No, I don't know if she is.  Right.  No, she's suing.  Suing. 
[01:10:00]  Suing.  Suing.  Suing.  Very good.  You see the weatherman video?  It's raining, man.  Hallelujah.  No?  Here, pause this.  Oh.  So you got this weatherman.  He blacks out during a live report from inside a stunt plane.  Would you go in a stunt plane?  I don't know if I could do that.  He's a good producer, but I don't think so.  Stunt plane. 
[01:10:30]  Would you go in one of those?  I don't know.  No.  Those two forces?  Fuck no.  That would scare the shit out of me.  I would definitely be afraid that you'd fucking, you know, just die.  You know?  That's crazy.  Remind me to discuss gravity after this.  Ooh.  I learned something.  I hit it.  Now, that was 4G.  We're going to go to 8G later.  How many do you do in the Red Bull?  We do 12 in the Red Bull Air Race.  Well.  Let's have a good forecast then. 
[01:11:00]  We're going 8G.  8G?  I want to see how long I can last at 8G.  I want to know if I'm at the top.  Oh, so he knows he's going to have a problem.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yep.  Okay.  What we're going to do is we're just going to set up here in 20 seconds.  We're going to go to 8G.  Can we pause before he does the 8G?  Wow.  How is it that the pilot doesn't pass out?  Do you know it?  Yeah.  They either have a pressure suit on.  Why doesn't this guy get the pressure suit?  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't want it.  Maybe they weren't going to do, like, crazy maneuvers. 
[01:11:30]  But you've got to be guaranteed that you're not going to pass out if you're the pilot.  Yeah.  How do they know that?  The pilot knows his limitations.  He also knows the signs that you're blacking out and then to pull out of the G-turn.  And there's also a thing you do where you hold your – almost hold your breath and push and do these tick things, they call them.  And it keeps the blood in your head while you're going in these –  And that's why you pass out because the blood just rushes out. 
[01:12:00]  The G's pushes the blood into your legs.  Gotcha.  And the pressure suits actually – they sense the G's and squeeze the blood from your legs and keep it in the upper part of your body.  It's pretty cool.  Why don't the G's push the – why don't you just fly upside down?  It will push into your head.  You can do math problems.  They do that, but that also has the effect of causing you to black out.  Too much blood going to your head.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to stay in those high G maneuvers for long. 
[01:12:30]  The pilots say, like, you'll just see, like, gray start coming into your field of view and your peripherals.  Right.  And it'll just close in and close in until you're just out.  Wow.  There have been pilots that have literally gone out and come back to consciousness with their plane, like, just flying itself.  It's crazy.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  All right, let's play this.  We're going to do a knife edge one way. 
[01:13:00]  Knife edge turn.  You ready?  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Picking up speed.  That's a small play to do H's.  Here we go.  There we go.  Oh, wow.  Let's go.  He's out.  Oh, my God.  He's out immediately.  Keep squeezing.  Keep squeezing.  Keep squeezing.  All cut.  We don't want to see.  All right.  Back to – back to –  Why did they cut it off?  Pause.  They cut away from it?  The news?  It looked like he had a stroke.  His whole face just collapses.  They cut away from it?  That's what happens?  He's just knocked out, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Your muscles just lose all control in your face?  Well, that was from the gravity.  That's the G's.  Right, right, right.  Of course.  You're putting his face down.  Like you're the wind or whatever.  Of course, yes.  All right.  No, I don't know, but his eyes look all droopy and shit, too.  Yeah, he wasn't pushing.  Because the pilot's trying to tell him to, you know, push, push, lock up, like, just squeeze.  Do you feel like shit when you come out of that?  I would assume you'd fucking have a headache like a motherfucker, really.  He must be nauseous.  Yeah.  Oh, imagine.  He swung that fucking thing around. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that's crazy.  I think there's more to this.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Oh, cut.  We don't want to see.  All right.  Back to – back to –  No, we want to see.  Woo!  That's right to me as well.  All right.  Are you with me?  Oh, let's go.  Great.  Oh, my God.  They're doing it again, and he's knocked out.  Are you okay, Grant?  We've lost the camera inside. 
[01:14:30]  Obviously, the camera can't cut it at 3G.  I mean, 8G, but are you back with me?  Are they still doing turns?  Yeah.  Oh, this poor guy.  Someone's got to tell the pilot his passenger is knocked out.  Okay.  Better you than me.  All right.  We will check back in with Grant in half an hour from now.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, wow.  He's fucked back.  By the way.  By the way.  We do a lot of visual shit on our show, and the country still doesn't understand the visual  element.  I'm not pitching.  I'm just giving you a fact. 
[01:15:00]  But a lot of these videos we talk about are on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock knows which ones to pop up there of interest.  Yeah.  Wow.  I figured it was.  That's fucked up.  And the pilot's just laughing.  Yeah, this is great.  Yeah, he's into it.  Fucking that guy.  Two seconds, he was out.  Jimmy, what did you want to say about gravity?  Oh, that's right.  You have something on gravity.  I was reading about...  I like scientific, Jim.  ...why astronauts float.  Now, Ant might know this.  I hope you may even know this, too. 
[01:15:30]  I didn't know this.  But what is it that makes you float?  Because there's this myth that you're in zero gravity.  But you're not in zero gravity.  At the altitude astronauts fly at, you're at about 10% less gravity than we're at right now.  They're dealing with 90% of the Earth's gravity when they are in the space shuttle and around the Earth.  They're not gravity-free.  The reason they float is because the way it works is when you take off like that, you're being thrown away with such force. 
[01:16:00]  It has something to do that when the rocket goes as far as it can go under that force, it begins to fall back.  So what's happening is they're floating because they're in a constant state of falling towards the Earth.  They are just missing the Earth and rotating.  That's what being in orbit is your speed is keeping you from falling into the Earth at the same rate the Earth and its gravitational pull is keeping you from jetting off away from the Earth. 
[01:16:30]  It's a balance between falling into the Earth and slingshotting away from the Earth.  So as you're constantly falling, relative to the little tin can you're in, you're weightless because you're constantly falling. 
[01:17:00]  But that's why the astronauts who have gone on spacewalks, a couple of them have said I was almost paralyzed with fear.  I was so scared because you're falling into the Earth and you're looking at yourself falling.  I forget how the guy said he did, but one of the astronauts said he was absolutely paralyzed with terror during a spacewalk  because you're out and you realize you're falling at 17,000 miles an hour.  Was that faggot Armstrong?  Oh, and they said there is a slight bit of oxygen at that altitude, and that's why, which will cause a little bit of friction, 
[01:17:30]  which will eventually slow you down enough where you would fall back through the atmosphere.  That's why every couple of years they would have to give it like a teeny bit of an engine fire.  Yeah, a little correction.  But I never realized that they were totally weightless, but obviously they're not.  They're fucking falling.  That's unbelievable.  Plummeting.  I did not know that.  I didn't either.  And they just keep missing the fucking Earth.  Yeah, there's got to be gravity there because that's what's holding the moon into orbit, too.  But I never thought of that. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, and the moon is doing the same thing.  It's constantly falling around the Earth.  It's the same thing.  There's a guy that says, Jimmy, you want a real explanation of how it works?  Okay, a better one, yes.  Maybe a more visual.  I think you described it pretty well.  It's perfect.  Stop it.  Let's go to Bernie in Pennsylvania.  Bernie.  So imagine you're traveling in a circle where you have a downward force towards the center of the circle being gravity,  but your forward force without gravity would just send you in a straight line.  So what happens when you're in orbit is you're traveling at exactly the right speed to maintain that circle 
[01:18:30]  given the acceleration towards the center of the circle.  Yeah, it's the balancing act I was talking about.  It's a fine line between jetting off away from the Earth and falling into it.  It's a perfect balance between forward momentum and the Earth's gravity pulling you back.  So let me ask you a question.  So what's keeping you floating, but what if now we don't have any... 
[01:19:00]  Now, where would you have to go to be beyond the gravitational pull of any planet?  Even when you're in interstellar space, are you still under the gravitational pull of dark matter?  Like, would you stop floating when you were out that far?  I'd bet.  Well, the reason that you float, that they appear to be floating, is that the space shuttle is falling at the same rate of speed as they are.  Right.  So they have...  It's basically one of the precepts of the general, you know, Einstein's special relativity theory. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, if you went into a shipping container and brought it up in a plane and put you in it and threw it out and it was falling, you'd be inside there weightless.  You'd be like, ooh, ooh, because relative to the shipping container, you're both falling at the same speed.  Like the vomit comet that they have.  Yeah, yeah, the planes, they go into these arcs where you feel like you're weightless because the plane itself is falling at the same speed you are. 
[01:20:00]  So you kind of float for a little while.  So is there any place in space where you would technically not be falling because you're not in any type of a gravitational pull?  I bet out in the middle of somewhere where you aren't even near any kind of mass in space, that is probably complete weightlessness.  And, again, it's all relative.  The space is all fucking relative.  But why is it weightless if you're not falling?  Because there's no gravity. 
[01:20:30]  There's nothing of any mass to pull on you.  You have to get away from a gravity well, which would be...  But, you know, I mean, fucking Pluto is spinning around the sun because of the sun's gravitational pull.  The planets are literally falling around the sun.  So you could go way out to fucking Pluto, which is literally falling around the sun, yet the sun's gravitational pull reacts to something so far away.  You'd have to be so far away from anything to not be influenced by it. 
[01:21:00]  And where does that stuff fall to?  It just keeps going around it.  There's a big floor, a giant broom.  Yeah, but what if it didn't go around anything?  Where does it fall to?  Where does it go?  It just kind of sits there in space.  Space.  I hate thinking about space.  But maybe once you get beyond the planets, you're bound by the same gravity that's holding the sun, and then beyond that, the same stuff that's holding the universe.  And maybe that's quad. 
[01:21:30]  If you look at the galaxy, too, the galaxy is, especially the Milky Way galaxy, kind of a spiral galaxy, it's spinning around a center.  And I think the same thing is happening.  It's all of those solar systems and stars in a galaxy are also spinning around something.  And then are those galaxies spinning around something greater in space itself?  What the fuck?  I'm getting so creeped out.  It is creepy. 
[01:22:00]  Because how did it begin?  And what was there before that?  And how was that there?  And how was that there?  Now you're talking something like 100, 200 years ago.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So we don't have – we have no clue.  I have a question for this guy.  Try to wrap your head around this stuff.  This guy seems to know.  Yeah, Bernie, what do you do for a living?  I'm a software engineer, but I studied a lot of physics in college.  Now, Bernie, let me ask you a question.  They released pictures from the Hubble recently that were 10 years in the making.  It was the deepest photos ever taken.  And it said it was one little spot in space. 
[01:22:30]  And it said the light gathered was over 10 years of images to get these images.  And they said that the light is one ten billionth of what the human eye can pick up.  Wow.  So that's how long it took with this powerful telescope to get these images so we would never see it.  Why is that?  I don't understand that.  Wow.  I'm not really sure because I didn't read the article.  Okay.  They must have been very far away, Jimmy.  They were? 
[01:23:00]  Very far away, images.  That's my guess.  It's just that –  But how does it gather the light?  So, like, how does it gather light over 10 years?  What does that mean, gathers light?  What is it gathering?  I'm gathering light.  It's probably like a camera when you open up the aperture and wait for a while.  And it enhances the image.  If something's really dark and you open up the aperture, it's going to let more light in.  Yeah, but this thing wasn't open for 10 years on the same spot. 
[01:23:30]  I think it was.  But how could it take pictures of anything else then if it was just open?  Hey, where's all these Hubble pictures?  We got one brewing.  They have computers that probably – they probably do a little bit of a picture for today, and then they do that every day for 10 years.  Maybe.  Maybe that's what they do.  And then they focus in on the same spot again for a little while, get a little more.  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  What do I know?  That's quite the story.  Dr. Steve might know.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:24:00]  I like how Dr. Steve fucking gets on Twitter and lets everybody know of some astronomical fucking shenanigans that are going on in the sky.  It's pretty cool.  Dr. Steve actually made me go out of my house at 4 in the morning because he was talking about something that was happening.  That you could see?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Let me take a look-see.  Yeah, if you look up, you're going to see the – the Hyaglokin star will be in the southwest skies.  Hyaglokin star.  And if you look west, you'll see it.  If you look north, you won't see that. 
[01:24:30]  You'll see – or what's it called?  The lights, the northern lights.  But the Hyaglokin star will be named after Herb Hyaglokin.  He was a physicist and a pederast from Norway.  Dave can explain the Hubble.  He can?  That's what he says.  Oh, boy.  Thanks, Bernie.  Let's go to Dave in North Carolina.  Dave.  You have a Hubble.  It's a big telescope up in the sky.  But what holds the Hubble there, Bob? 
[01:25:00]  This is a two-parter.  What holds the Hubble is centrifugal force.  If you stop the Hubble from moving around the Earth, just like the XM Sirius satellites,  if you stop its motion rotating or orbiting around the Earth, it would, exactly, just fall to the Earth.  So centrifugal force is what's holding all of those satellites out there.  Okay, moving on to these space images, the reason it takes so long to get these images  and the reason we can't see them with the naked eye is some of these galaxies are over 10 billion light-years away. 
[01:25:30]  In other words, the light we're seeing from them took 10 billion years to reach us.  It's just pretty amazing.  And if you just think of taking a picture at night when you don't have enough light,  well, if you open your – or leave your shutter open a lot longer, you'll get a grainy image,  but you'll also get an image that you wouldn't get otherwise.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  When you say it took 10 billion years to get here, the light reaches us,  how do you know light has reached you?  Like, I'm seeing light far away. 
[01:26:00]  Does that – when you can see it, does that mean the light reached you?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's always light that's going to reach you.  It may be just a few photons of light, but it will reach.  I mean, it just – but it spreads out so incredibly wide.  It's what's called the inverse square law.  You should look that up unless you want a boring –  Well, I've actually –  I break that one all the time.  I show my PBA card.  They let me go.  The inverse square.  I am that because I'm so cool of an inverse square law.  Oh, that's great, Jimmy.  What is the inverse square law? 
[01:26:30]  What is the –  It's when cookie people are living in a box, and it's not a square.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  Hi.  Can we get him on the show?  You're not going to hang up on me like you did?  No.  No, no, man.  You did well.  I actually want to know, what is the inverse square law?  Yes.  Inverse square law says that if light travels twice the distance,  it weakens or spreads out, actually, the square of that distance. 
[01:27:00]  So if I'm 10 feet from a light, and then I go to 20 feet from a light,  I've doubled my distance, but now that light is four times as dim as it was.  If I go another –  But it's four times wider, too?  No, yes.  It's four times the area, I guess, is the best way to look.  Because you can't get something for nothing.  So when you're spreading it out over a wider area, it's going to be dimmer.  Yeah, so that by the time it gets – 
[01:27:30]  Oh, I can't –  Yeah, yeah.  That makes perfect sense.  But how come when we see light that left 10 billion years ago,  we're seeing it only as a pinprick where it's spreading out?  If it's spread out so far, how come we're not just seeing it all over the fucking place?  I just want to say, you're just seeing a few photons that have been able to reach Earth, I guess.  Right, all the rest have been diffused around the fucking galaxy.  Yeah, they're all traveling out at the same rate from the center of that – 
[01:28:00]  or from the surface of that star or that galaxy.  That's why it's so dim, because you're only getting a few little ones to your eyeball.  Oh, yeah, you're spreading them out.  But here's something really fun to think about.  Yes.  When you're seeing light – and this is what's so useful to astronomers or astrophysicists –  is you're seeing this light from 10 billion years ago.  What you're seeing is what happened 10 billion years ago.  You don't know what happened in that 10 billion years.  It's just like the light from the sun.  It takes eight minutes to get to it. 
[01:28:30]  So the sun could –  No shit, Sherlock!  Yes, if the sun exploded –  We wouldn't know for eight minutes.  You wouldn't know for eight minutes.  Although –  I wouldn't know.  Yeah.  You would know?  I have special dispensation.  Okay, do you email us, the sun?  At sun – it's got to be at sun06, because somebody has at sun.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not even the sun.  The moon won't sell us. 
[01:29:00]  All right, Dave.  Thank you very much.  Thank you so much there, sir.  I love our science time here on –  Being on the radio is like having Google.  Yes, it really is.  Just ask something, and somebody will call in.  A lot of dumb and bad results, but always one good one.  It's like being back in school.  Yeah.  We did music class already.  We did science.  We did some music class with Tom Papa.  Now we're in science class.  Social studies.  Yeah.  We certainly did some social studies as well.  We had a story about a fat broad.  I heard.  And then we just trot upon English. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, we certainly did.  All day.  All right, Tom Poppins studio, but we are going to take a break.  Tom is going to be where, Thomas?  I'm going to the Stress Factory this weekend.  Oh, fuck.  Right on.  In New Jersey.  You should relax.  Vinny's place.  Relax.  It's so stressful.  It's stressful at the Stress Factory.  Does he play those videos still before the show?  He plays videos and makes phony phone calls, because it's a crazy place.  He does.  He doesn't do the phony phone calls, though.  No, I don't think so.  No?  But he put his name in it now, so it's now the Vinny Brand Stress Factory and all the 
[01:30:00]  signage.  Oh.  Wow.  Why would he do that?  Why?  He gotistical shithead.  Why would he do that?  Because for all these years, nobody knows it's me.  Who cares?  Nobody knows that I own it.  Nobody cares.  They think I'm just an emcee.  He's a great club owner.  He's a great club owner.  It's an awesome club.  Yeah, it's amazing.  The Vinny Brands.  It's not like Jack Dempsey's or something.  Exactly.  What the fuck is he doing?  What do you think?  We're going to Vinny Brand's place in the Bronx.  It's perfect for us.  I can tape the gun behind the phone.  His act is in the toilet. 
[01:30:30]  I want my brother coming out with something other than Z's in his head.  He thinks he's Mickey Mantle all of a sudden.  I know.  Exactly.  I wish he was dead with a liver problem.  You're fucking Vinny Brand.  What are you doing?  Just like Dangerfield.  Remember how Dangerfield's?  Yeah.  Dangerfield's everything.  Yeah, but Dangerfield was a movie star.  Yeah.  Of Vinny.  Yeah, so now it's the Vinny Brands Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  What a guy.  Yeah.  That's a good guy.  Now I've got to change my resume.  I've got to add Vinny Brand to it. 
[01:31:00]  No one will know the place you're talking about if you just say Stress Factory.  But Tom Papa will be there starting tonight?  Tonight.  Friday and Saturday.  Very cool.  All right.  We're going to take a break and we'll continue here.  New from Puddin' Head Records, Opie and Anthony present Sittin' and Singin' the Handicap Hits.  I'm rollin' with the devil.  Yes, I'm rollin'.  It's all the rock you know and love. 
[01:31:30]  Done specifically for people without leg mobility.  Cause traps like us.  And baby, we were born to roll.  Just because your legs don't work doesn't mean your ears don't.  Just ask Van Halen.  Hey, I wish I could jump.  I'm never gonna jump.  Might as well just sit here.  The hits just keep rollin' in.  If only they could walk.  Ah, yes.  I would roll 100 miles and I would roll 500 more. 
[01:32:00]  But my hands would hurt cause I'm rollin'.  Get it?  I sit in the chair that you're in.  Now, face north.  You roll around 90 degrees and still just sit here.  It's Sittin' and Singin' the Handicap Hits.  From your pals at Puddin' Head Records and The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going, this motherfucker, Fran Suckdick, I call her. 
[01:32:30]  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's like jumpin' in there.  I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm callin' her over.  And this classless piece of fuckin' shit that talks like a fuckin' truck driver is givin' me the fingers.  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics.  I like girl comics that are fuckin' funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem. 
[01:33:00]  I just hate the ones that fuckin' stink at what they fuckin' do.  And she's fuckin' awful.  And I think she's a scumbag for fuckin' with me.  How about you stay home and actually raise the fuckin' baby you have  rather than trying out for a fuckin' Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck?  I'm tellin' ya, honestly, I know her.  She's joking.  That's not real.  Oh, then my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[01:33:30]  3SXM  The O.P.D.A. 3 Show  Did Travis pick this one? 
[01:34:00]  Yep.  Pearl Jam Day, Tom Papa.  Why don't you play the hits, E-Rock?  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is this?  I never even heard it.  They don't have any hits.  Can it be Eddie Vedder solo also, or just straight up Pearl Jam?  Why?  You like Eddie Vedder solo?  Yeah.  With the ukulele?  Yeah, I like the ukulele.  I like that sad Sean Penn movie with the kid in the woods.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What was that called?  Kid in the Woods.  Oh, okay. 
[01:34:30]  Kid in the Woods.  Oh, I thought that was a movie about telling jokes to the woods.  You're an ass.  Kid in the Woods.  Into the Wild.  Into the Wild.  Yeah, he did a great version of The Big Heart song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of people in the Big Heart song.  A lot of people don't know that's a cover.  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[01:35:00]  You don't like this?  You don't like this?  This is a great song, man.  I'm a better fan.  This is a great song.  I like a few Pearl Jam tunes, but not Vedder solo.  But I'm not one of these, like, fucking Travis all mow for the guy.  Does Travis like this?  Travis likes anything this fucking guy does.  I love this song.  I do, too.  Why don't you like this?  Back again.  I've heard this song.  This is good.  Yeah.  Just picture a lonely kid in the woods at the same time. 
[01:35:30]  That idiot.  What did he eat?  He was a moron.  The wrong berry or something?  Yeah, what a douche.  What a nice berries, dick.  Did he like this for the movie?  No, there's a cover.  I forgot the name of the band.  I used to know the name of the band.  Fuck.  Bengals?  No, it's a one-hit wonder, really.  A band we don't really know much about in America.  What's the name of the band of the original?  Beatles?  I'm saying Indio. 
[01:36:00]  Indio is it?  Yes.  Play that.  What song is this called?  What's it called?  It's called Hard Sun.  Hard Sun.  It's good stuff.  But this is the original.  That movie was pretty lame.  This goes back to like 1990-ish, maybe late 80s.  Yeah, because I used to love this song when it came out.  Do you know this?  Yeah.  No.  Indio's version?  I don't know.  Turn this up.  They actually do a better job.  Yeah, I didn't know this.  It sounds like it has a 70s sound to it. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, turn it up.  It's a great song.  Where are these guys from?  I want to know more about this band.  Does anyone know?  Yeah, what happened in Indio?  They broke up in 1993 when the guitarist was killed in a car accident in Belfast.  Jeez.  He's lying. 
[01:37:00]  How'd you Google it?  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm looking at his face.  He's looking at iTunes.  He's lying.  It's iTunes on his screen.  That was good.  How'd you pick that up?  I really believe it.  He does it all the time.  I'm a good actor.  He's just now.  That was good.  Jimmy would be great in an interrogation for like 10 seconds.  He'd be like, I don't know if he's telling the job.  All right, he's lying.  If you want to know if Jimmy's lying, don't say a word and just stare at him.  Give him five seconds.  He can't hold it. 
[01:37:30]  I giggle.  But now he's using props.  He's using his phone.  Yes.  I looked it up on Google.  I look over.  It's iTunes.  It's got iTunes and Twitter up.  He's buying Eddie Vedder.  I want to know if these guys had another song, if they're famous somewhere else.  Is this too much for people?  What are you doing, Jimmy?  Do people care?  Sorry.  Eddie Vedder is a Canadian singer-songwriter whose name is Gordon Peterson.  Okay.  Released one album in 89.  That had Hard Sun on it.  What's it called?  Hard Sun?  S-O-N or S-U-N? 
[01:38:00]  Jimmy, you should download it.  I think you would like this song.  That's what I'm looking for right now.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut.  Eddie Vedder's version is really good, too.  Yeah, Eddie Vedder's version is really good.  He absolutely does.  Doesn't it go like, Hard Sun?  Yeah, something like that.  I respect Eddie Vedder because he stayed true to the song.  You're the voice of a generation.  Yeah.  He didn't fuck with the song and try to make it his own.  He kind of stayed true to it.  Yeah, he stayed true, Ant.  Did a cover. 
[01:38:30]  He stays true.  He stayed true.  What a guy.  I don't give a fuck.  That Indio guy's got to be pissed because when this song became a massive hit for Eddie Vedder,  they didn't really talk about Indio at all.  No.  I don't see Indio even listed here.  I'm getting Eddie Vedder's version.  I wonder if he moved on to another band that we know or something.  His voice is too good for him to just go away like that.  Maybe he had a problem with alcohol or food.  Why are we still talking about this?  No one gives a fuck.  Maybe he got in a car.  I just wanted to know.  Tom Popp at the Stress Factory this weekend, starting tonight. 
[01:39:00]  Let's not forget.  Oh, yeah.  Great comedy club.  Vinnie Brands.  Vinnie Brands.  Stress Factory.  If I hear anybody calling it that, it's on the sign, Jimmy.  It's on the sign.  How big is the font, though, for his name?  It's like a bubble font.  It's like that bubbly comedy.  Looking wacky.  I guarantee you, he went through the store sign and he goes, at the sign store, he goes,  I want this.  And the guy's like, you want what?  Stress Factory?  Oh, look.  He's got it up in the little thing that's around.  Vinnie Brands. 
[01:39:30]  Stress Factory.  What is he doing?  It's like, who?  Here, Vinnie Brands.  Stress Factory.  Nobody wants to hear that.  It all depends how big his name is.  I want to see the actual sign.  It's tiny.  Vinnie Brands.  Look at Tom Popp on the Facebook page.  Adorable.  That fucking awful fucking smile.  It is a forced smile.  Oh, is that the...  There's that phone.  I hate that phone.  Oh, who likes it?  Has it always been Vinnie Brands.  Stress Factory?  No.  He just changed.  He changed. 
[01:40:00]  He said, after 20 years, nobody knew it was mine.  And I would go up and I'd host some people like, you're a good MC.  And nobody knew I was the owner.  So then I put my name in it.  And now everybody knows I'm Vinnie Brands.  Stress Factory.  Why don't you just tell them in a joke form?  Why do you...  The beautiful thing is you don't need them to know you're the...  Oh, Vinnie.  You're preaching to the converted here.  We all know he's an ass.  I don't like the place anymore.  Oh.  I think tickets are pretty good on Saturday, but Friday I have to sell.  Oh, yeah.  Saturday's always sell.  You need a little help there, Tom Papa?  For Friday.  Why the fuck wouldn't you see Tom Papa? 
[01:40:30]  Really?  Are you kidding me?  I'll say this.  For as much as I dislike Tom personally, Tom fucking kills...  Alan Havey was upstairs.  We were talking about comics that kill.  And Havey said he thinks Tom kills harder than anyone.  Really?  I mean, Havey's irrelevant.  No one cares what he thinks.  He's old.  No, but no.  Alan knows.  And he said that.  And we were all kind of like, yeah, he does kill.  No one ridiculed Alan for saying that.  Really?  We were all like, yeah.  You know?  That's very nice of you. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Tom fucking murders on stage.  Especially at Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  I don't like going after Tom because he kills really hard, but it's clean.  But it's not cutesy clean.  It's funny clean.  It's like Regan.  It's an edgy clean?  Right.  Yeah, I mean, it's family stuff.  It's adult stuff.  I haven't seen you in a long time, Tom Papa.  I know.  Maybe I should go.  Maybe you should come.  I'm taping my new special that Rob Zombie's going to direct on March 7th in the city.  I'll invite you to that.  Will you officially invite me to that? 
[01:41:30]  I will officially invite you to that.  I will.  Because I'm going to forget that we have this conversation.  But I would go to that.  Are you coming for cocktails on Monday?  Yes, I am.  This is very nice.  I like this.  This is a very grown-up cocktail.  It's called what?  Winter Cocktails?  It's called Winter Depression Cocktails.  He names his part.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  Him and his wife throw a really good little shindig.  You get there as a fucking cheese wheel and cracker.  Jimmy was so hungry last time that he pulled himself up to like, it's just a big table just  with food for everybody to pick on. 
[01:42:00]  Jimmy pulled up a chair and just sat there like it was his table and ate everything.  I ate like a hog.  What treats?  I usually get there after my spot.  I always do my spot and then head over to Tom's.  How late?  I get there at like 8.30.  Oh, okay.  It's not that late.  It's a 7 o'clock start, but I don't get there at 7.  Let them get the girls loosening up on the shoulders.  You enjoy a good cheese wheel?  I do.  Yeah?  Colin always comes early.  Colin's the early shift.  I always miss Colin.  Let's go through the cheeses.  Which one do you like there, Jimmy?  Well, I'm a fucking...  Are you a good cheddar...  You're like a cheddar guy, right?  I fucking love cheddar.  Extra cheddar. 
[01:42:30]  Extra cheddar.  It's all about the cheddar.  Yes.  I'm not about the soft cheeses that you gotta fucking knife out.  Some of them are good, though.  They smell like a zoo.  A zoo.  It's terrible sometimes.  I told you my high school name.  Throw up and fucking...  What was your high school nickname?  The Gouda Kid.  The Gouda Kid.  I enjoy a good Swiss to mix it up in between my cheddar.  So you like the traditional cheeses.  You don't like the out-of-the-box Roqueforts?  No.  Or Bourdainians. 
[01:43:00]  The Framunda.  Of course.  And I like cheese with a little heat as well.  Like a pepper jack?  A little pepper jack.  I like pepper jack.  Pepper jack.  I used to love...  When I was in high school...  What are you, a Mormon?  What's wrong with you?  Pepper jack rules.  I like a good spreadable cheese in a fucking...  Like when you're flying American to L.A.  You like anything spreadable.  Oh, yes.  And they bring out a nice cheese plate.  I'm like, I'd have to be like a cad to not enjoy a good cheese plate. 
[01:43:30]  With the grapes?  I know.  What a classy party.  Don't get a gentleman.  Like this.  Let's make sure Tom gets the proper cheeses.  Don't get the Parmesan cheese.  That's stupid.  Hard Parmesan.  I like that big...  Hard Parmesan crumbles off.  It's good.  That shit you're shaving onto your pasta.  You don't eat that as a cheese appetizer.  I go to an Italian restaurant where they do that and they have some balsamic reduction.  Hopefully you'll die with Salazzo next time.  How's the Italian food in this place? 
[01:44:00]  Your head falls off.  You grab your throat.  Grab my neck.  Looks stupid for five seconds.  A mouthful of veal.  Yeah.  You like the Parmesan.  I do.  I like it with a balsamic reduction and a little bread crust like that.  Well, Mitchell Tom has that.  Oh, marron.  Marron.  Well, I thought it would be fun last time to have some tater tots, which is nice.  It's not fancy, but we were all of them as kids.  Keith Robinson does not love the tots, and he just rips me apart for a year now. 
[01:44:30]  What the fuck?  Why are you having the tots, man?  Stupid.  Why are you so cheap you're having the tots?  You should have told him to get back in the kitchen until he's needed.  Right, exactly.  I got to take back the soft cheese thing.  Why?  Why?  Blue cheese.  Oh.  It needed the money!  Exactly.  He was gray on the wire.  That's why I did it.  Blue cheese.  Blue cheese.  Blue cheese is good.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, so we'll walk around.  Do you cut the mold off your cheeses? 
[01:45:00]  No.  I had a friend.  He, what?  He looked at me strange like I didn't cut the mold off.  No, he doesn't even know what cheese is.  No, he's a fucking child.  Sam, Sam, Sam will not eat.  Well, you'll eat some.  What cheese will you eat?  Whiz.  American?  I eat a lot.  A bunch of cheeses.  I'll have, obviously, cheddar, mozzarella.  And mozzarella sticks.  Cheddar is very popular.  Do you like the extra sharp?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't cheese really annoy me.  Dollar. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, you got to cut the mold.  What is it called to cut the mold, right?  What about a nice brie?  No.  Yeah.  No.  Too fancy?  Olsen, yes.  You got the grapes to go along with the cheese?  Yeah, you got to have grapes.  Green grapes.  Green grapes.  Are you going to go with some meats?  Some cured meats?  Some speck?  Some prosciutto?  Prosciutto.  I usually get that stuff.  Oh, my God.  Now you're talking.  What about the pepperoni?  Yeah, nice pepperoni.  Eataly.  Get it from Eataly. 
[01:46:00]  Eataly.  So these parties are good, Jimmy?  Yeah, I hate to admit it.  Any fist fights by the end of it?  No, it's a real gentlemanly affair.  Is it elegant?  Usually there's a victim.  So, you know, they pull someone out of the herd and make him the victim.  I think Voss was it last time.  I got killed last time, too.  Yeah, you got killed last time?  I don't remember that.  I'm surprised that it's Voss.  I tried to add Joe DeRosa to the list this time when he was a first-time invitee, hoping  that he would be the victim, but he's going to be out of town. 
[01:46:30]  I'm a first-time invitee.  You won't be a victim, though.  It'll probably be Voss.  Voss is coming.  Oh, all right.  Then that's good.  You know what?  You can have all good intentions to pull out a victim, but if Voss is there?  I feel it's just a good thing in the middle of the winter.  This is like the final part of the depression.  And just to get all comedians together just to do something other than working.  We start Voss appearances on this show with good intentions every time. 
[01:47:00]  There are times we actually will talk and go, all right, let's do it different today.  Let's just fucking let Voss be part of the action.  And then he goes off on his shit, and then next thing you know, it's the same Voss appearance  over and over again.  Over and over.  We just beat the shit out of him.  Well, it happens for a reason.  And then he fights back.  You're right.  I love when he fights back.  He's strong when he fights back.  Don't you hate, though, when he turns into the sad Voss?  When he actually looked like he gets kind of pensive?  Pensive. 
[01:47:30]  Poor Voss.  So we didn't learn anything about Indio.  Well, Canadian, we learned.  But he didn't have another song that amazes me.  I guess not.  So maybe something went wrong with him.  Yeah.  He went crazy or something.  Was it just a mystery?  Crazy.  No one just disappears.  He's a mystery because this song by Eddie Vedder becomes huge, so then you would think  other people would wonder what happened to the original guy.  Yeah.  And they just don't have much info on this guy online.  Weird.  So we can move on to Irish Chick.  Maybe Eddie Vedder killed him. 
[01:48:00]  Let's move on to Irish Chick.  Irish Chick.  Now, I officially have not heard this.  I saw a lot of people tweeting this yesterday, Ant.  You were loving this one, huh?  She was the internet sensation of yesterday, I guess.  I mean, she's yesterday news today.  Yeah, one day.  That's it.  Oh, no.  Like, tomorrow or something, the news will be like, and a brand new video.  Yeah, yeah.  The news is everything you saw on the internet a few days ago.  Right.  That's what the news has become.  And newspapers are completely irrelevant.  It's like finding an old fucking issue with National Geographic in the basement. 
[01:48:30]  That's what fucking today's paper is these days.  Videos become huge for a day and a half.  Yeah.  Day and a half.  That's the shelf life of the video.  That's it.  That's amazing.  That's it.  Get your fucking views in, because it goes away.  Yeah.  This is some Irish chick from Ireland.  And I think what she's getting at is that she's very angry at something that happened  with her soccer game that she's watching on TV.  But how could she tell something went wrong with her soccer game?  What do you mean? 
[01:49:00]  Soccer.  Oh, right.  That's true.  I don't even have to explain it.  Soccer.  What could possibly go wrong that you're upset?  I think it had something to do with one of the refs making a call or something.  I don't know, because apparently we have a shared language with Ireland.  It's English.  Oh, really?  But I don't know what the fuck this girl is even speaking.  Is she speaking that Brad Pitt shit?  I don't know what it is.  You can make out a couple words.  I made out kunt at the end. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  They love that word.  She goes there.  Oh, fuck yeah.  She's cursing up a storm.  I love that word there.  Yeah, they do like that word.  I forgot.  She's cursing up a storm.  But, yeah, play it.  And let's hear, how old would you say she is?  Maybe 14, 13, something like that.  And she's very angry.  That's fucking it.  I'm ready for fucking Grand Prix.  Fuck, I know.  You get the last 16, but you can't fucking beat them fucking black and white bastards.  You're mad at us.  Don't you turn to me, Sonic? 
[01:50:00]  I think that's it.  This should be the next horror movie.  You blastered, you fucking bastards.  That's it.  That's it.  You just didn't be proud by making it the last 16th.  But you just could have pushed yourself harder to make it the fucking semi-venals or something.  Them bastards, you can beat Barcelona 2 fucking 1.  But you can't fucking beat Juventus.  See, fucking hell, like that's ridiculous.  See, it even brought on our wee fucking Tony back. 
[01:50:30]  See, I referee, you Spanish fucking bastard.  Give names everything, you Spanish cunt, you dick.  You whacker, I call you every fucking month or something.  I couldn't give a fuck, you Spanish.  See, you're doing me, you Spanish cunt.  You Spanish fucking cunt.  It looks like she's watching soccer.  Our team is losing.  I thought it was a soccer game she was involved with.  Uh-oh.  Tell us how you really feel. 
[01:51:00]  Holy fuck.  Are you shitting me?  Holy fuck.  Good lord.  Tell us how you're fucking raging.  Oh, it's terrible.  Is she, no, she's Irish.  She's Scottish, no.  That's Irish.  I didn't know.  Trying so hard to be loved by her dad.  Oh, man.  She is a fucking hooligan. 
[01:51:30]  That's great, though.  She's hilarious.  Imagine if there wasn't soccer.  These people, like, they would just be marching on Spain.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, I don't, that whole soccer, like, the fanaticism with soccer over there is really  something that's beyond us here.  I mean, obviously, we have football fans and baseball fans, but the fanaticism does not  go as far as the soccer does over there.  I mean, it has replaced, like, the wars they want to have. 
[01:52:00]  Exactly.  Like, they went through two world wars over there.  Yeah.  They don't want any more of that shit, because it wrecks everything.  All their buildings and art and everything.  Culture.  Right.  So they replaced it with soccer.  Exactly.  It's kind of brilliant.  You Spanish cunt!  You fucking Spanish cunt!  When the Spanish came out, that's when she really went nuts.  Yes.  Yeah.  And, you know, they have to stop guys from traveling within Europe, like, when there's  a soccer match.  They're like, no.  The people from Liverpool are not allowed on the train today. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Because they don't want them coming into the next city.  Right.  And starting shit.  And tearing it up.  It is amazing.  That's adorable, though, isn't it?  I love it.  You Spanish cunt!  Fucking, fucking, fucking Spanish cunt!  I'm going to teach my daughter to talk like that.  That is cool.  No one's going to fuck with her.  How great is that?  You got daughters, you'd want them to talk like that, right?  Yeah, no one's going near her.  No.  No girl, no guy.  You Spanish cunt!  Because if that was just some American girl cursing like that and talking about it, you'd 
[01:53:00]  just be like, all right, whatever.  Yeah.  I wonder if, in Ireland, people just watch that video and go, ah, fuck her.  It's nothing.  Right?  Exactly.  It's not funny.  It's nothing.  Like, but here, the accent makes it fucking hilarious.  She's got a good point.  Yeah.  She's fucking bloody well, right?  That fucking Spanish cunt!  Yeah, that's going to do well, that video.  Yeah.  That guy was doing well yesterday.  I know.  Is it on the front page of LiveLeak?  No, it's on LiveLeak.  I don't know if it's on LiveLeak.  Have we got it on our Facebook page there? 
[01:53:30]  Yep.  Opie and Anthony.  Is LiveLeak the place where all the cool kids go?  LiveLeak's pretty good.  That is your more edgy YouTube.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, they let you get away with a few more things.  Yeah, I see.  I saw that one yesterday, that guy having his hat removed over there in, I forgot where  it was.  It might have been Syria.  Some guy's, he's got a sniper rifle.  It's up on top of a little embankment, and he's trying to peek through the scope.  You could tell.  He's putting his head up, putting his head up, da-da-da, and his hat, his wool hat goes  boom, flying off, and he's got a hole in the top of his head. 
[01:54:00]  He just got shot right in the fucking top of his head.  Oh, man.  But not his head.  He survived?  I don't think so, but I don't know.  Try to find that one, young Sam.  Jeez.  It's a sniper hat removal, I think.  No.  Well, that's what it was.  Of a Spanish reverie.  That's right, sniper hat.  Well, that's what it was with, um, Sniper Gets Sniped?  Yeah, Sniper Gets Sniped.  Is that it?  No.  It's a re-post.  No.  Headshot. 
[01:54:30]  It's a lot of headshots.  I know, right?  I don't know what it's called.  Fuck.  Somebody tweeted it to me, and, um...  Wasn't that first one?  And put, like, hat removal, because we always talk about how funny hat removals are.  Especially when they're really old ladies.  It might have been Sniper Gets Sniped.  Ooh, who's getting oatmeal today?  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Whoa, Jimmy, what'd you get?  Wow, Jimmy.  Oatmeal and blueberries.  Happy.  With a little...  How are the blueberries today?  Would you like some blueberries? 
[01:55:00]  You'd like some blueberries.  Would you like some blueberries?  Sniping goes wrong?  Is it this one?  That might be the guy.  That looks like the setup.  Let's see.  Watch this.  Yeah, he's peeking up over the...  Yeah, he's trying to get a view.  The mound or whatever.  He's definitely being shot at.  Uh...  Doesn't look well trained.  Oh.  Oops.  Nah, he's done.  Oh, he's done.  And then they show, like...  Fake, so fake.  Watch.  There's a hole in the top of his head.  Ow.  But you see him move.  Look.  Was that him moving or someone moving him? 
[01:55:30]  All up, bum, all up, bum, all up, bum.  It just says bye-bye.  Oh.  That was brutal.  Bum, la, wut, bum.  Bum, la, wut, bum.  Bum, la, wut, bum.  And then they blow up.  It's great.  That was the exit wound.  Yeah.  Oh.  Right?  It looked like it went through the top of his head, but not, like, down.  Looks like it went across the top of his head.  Oy.  Kind of opened up his skull a little bit.  I saw a video from Syria of a guy who had been shot in the mouth. 
[01:56:00]  Ooh.  And it looked like his jaw had been shot off.  And they load him into the car, I think, where he's in a hospital.  Like, argh.  Oh, it's all pouring down.  Oh, my God.  It was fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  He was really scared.  Yeah.  I saw this great one where this kitten was chasing a guy's foot under the blanket.  Aw.  Aw.  It's adorable.  I've seen that one.  Is that oatmeal, Jimmy?  Yeah.  All right.  I want what you're having.  I just need, uh...  That's my favorite line from When Harry Met Sally. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  I'll have a cheese hat.  It's special.  What made her pussy so wet?  She just came so loud.  I'll have that.  I'll have the knock where she has shoved at her pussy.  That guy that got his mouth blown off?  I was watching that video.  It's very disgusting.  But he looked like, uh...  He looked like Dr. Zoidberg.  It was like that shit just hanging down from the top.  Oh.  It was really disgusting.  I don't like those, though.  That's awful.  Someone that shot my mouth off. 
[01:57:00]  It's disgusting.  Creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not into those.  I love some good pornography.  Yes.  I like something like that.  That hat removal one wasn't too graphic.  No.  By good, he means kitty.  And I like watching...  I like watching the Allah Akbar guys blow themselves up with weaponry.  They either don't know how to operate or operate improperly.  That's always good.  Allah Akbar! 
[01:57:30]  And they stand there with a big fucking mortar.  Allah Akbar!  And the whole fucking thing blows up on them.  That was that guy's problem.  He didn't really look trained.  It was very shaky.  Oh, no.  He was just kind of bopping his head up.  He went a little nervous.  He didn't know not to poke his head up either.  No.  You know how much a bullet must hurt when it hits you in the top of the dome?  Holy fuck.  Oh, that's got a quick death, though.  Quick, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really quick.  Ouch.  You think you could be a soldier?  Never.  Thank you.  Never.  I would do, like, just enough where people aren't on my shit. 
[01:58:00]  That is it.  Yeah.  That is it.  He's getting supplies again, sir.  I would always have a reason that I'm not in the action.  Yeah.  But it would make sense.  I'll go get it.  Right, right, right.  We don't need power bars.  What are you doing?  The firefight.  I'm going to get waters, everybody.  There's a picture.  And that's why I respect every one of those fuckers.  I don't know how you do that.  I don't know how.  It's easy.  Dude, there was a photo I saw yesterday that somebody tweeted, and it said, like, this 
[01:58:30]  is a man, and I will never be this, like, much of a man.  Right.  I think it was from World War II or Korea.  From World War II or Korea.  This guy was injured, obviously, and another soldier had him over his back, and they were  trudging through mud under fire, and the guy that was wounded on the guy's back was  turned around with his pistol out, shooting behind him.  Come on.  Find this picture.  This guy who was so much fun.  Find this picture, man.  Oh, you just look at that and go, those are two men. 
[01:59:00]  Exactly.  Did you retweet that yesterday?  No, I didn't retweet it.  Just be hands overhead.  Yeah.  Crying at the same time.  Someone send that picture in immediately.  I want to see it.  It's so gritty looking.  Wow.  You could tell it was taken in the midst of some heavy shit.  Was it Vietnam, or was it?  It looked like World War II.  Okay.  But, you know, you can't really tell with a picture like that.  It was in a big mud puddle.  What's amazing is when you talk to these guys and see these guys interviewed, they, 
[01:59:30]  and it's like, oh my God, so what did you feel in that moment?  Well, I was just doing my job.  Yeah.  I mean, they have no, like, emotion.  It's just, no, that's just what you do.  That's what I do.  You don't overthink it.  Then they get back into the back room, and they just take out all this repressed rage  on their neighbors.  Their wife.  Yeah, the guy shot dead because he forgot to bring back so much lawnmower.  How are the blueberries?  They're very mediocre today.  Oh, are they?  Because I'm about to commit to the blueberries today.  I was going to ask for a couple.  He did not get too afraid. 
[02:00:00]  How do they go day to day?  I like to have blueberries examined.  Do you?  Have them what?  Examined.  They have to be a little cloudy.  Cloudy.  Yeah, just a little cloudy.  Yeah.  These are a little too tart.  Blueberries look like they took a money shot.  I want to see his picture now.  I know.  It's pretty fucking cool.  I don't know.  Did you have any thought of going into the military?  Oh, God, no.  Never.  Never.  I was too scared to leave home. 
[02:00:30]  I tried to join.  They would not take me when I was 18.  No way.  You tried to join?  You tried to join what?  The Army Reserves.  Really?  No.  I just want some attention.  I just want some attention.  Why didn't you go with that for a while?  That is a good one.  They wouldn't take me.  It sounds like, well, I really tried, guys.  Then there's got to be a reason.  He would have had to make up a reason.  We were lucky enough to be between wars.  Yeah.  I always thought, oh, God, if there's a war, oh, my God, they're going to call us.  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy.  First Iraq we could have gotten into.  We could have had a little of that action.  Right?  Tail end?  If that got a little ugly, possibly, yes.  I thought maybe Iran was going to be a big one.  Like, I thought that was going to perk up during the hostage thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you had to sign up for a selective service.  They, like, started that when I was in my late teens.  Oh, really?  Restarted the selective service where you got to sign up. 
[02:01:30]  I didn't sign up.  You didn't?  No.  I think you're...  Oh, boy.  I don't remember that.  I mean, I signed up.  Of course I signed up.  Oh, boy.  That's what I'm talking about.  Of course I am.  Yeah.  And then my brother went in.  He went into the Army.  Oh, yeah?  And I remember that.  You're like...  Did you always in the Army?  Yeah.  It was an 82nd Airborne.  Jumped out of planes with parachutes.  Did he really?  Yeah, man.  Fucking lunatic.  And he got in because it was like, yeah, you know, you get money for school and it's peace  time.  I don't know. 
[02:02:00]  And then the fucking hostage situation was started.  So, he finds himself in the back of like a C-130 with all his shit on, on alert.  Oh, no.  He's like, yeah, this is fucking great.  Wait, what did he do?  In the 70s?  Yeah, like 79, I think.  He just wanted to pay for books.  80.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just found himself in the action all of a sudden?  Holy fuck.  It's this.  And then he went 82nd Airborne just so he wouldn't have to go to Germany because he wanted to  kind of stay in the States. 
[02:02:30]  So, he goes that, he goes through all that, and then they shove him in a plane to fucking  He's like, well, okay.  Where, man?  He was on his way to where?  They just had him on standby, on alert, to go to fucking Iran.  I'll say it again.  God bless all you guys.  Yeah.  That is some real shit, man.  Yeah.  I don't know how you wrap your head around it.  I always think of that moment, like when you're on the plane heading over.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah, that's a lot of hard work.  Take a free plane ride.  God, who's that? 
[02:03:00]  What character is that, Jimmy?  That doesn't quite grasp the situation.  Doesn't quite grasp the graveness of the situation, guy.  As long as we don't have Drunk Jimmy in today, I'm fine.  Drunk Jimmy was deeply disturbing.  It was disturbing.  The feedback on Drunk Jimmy was old.  Yeah, yeah.  He came in here as Drunk Jimmy one day.  Yeah, you didn't hear that?  Wow.  Oh, really?  Because we were asking him what kind of a drinker he was, and boy, did he show us. 
[02:03:30]  He gave us a fucking lesson.  What was he like?  Pleasant.  He was not pleasant.  Was he an angry?  Oh, man.  You know, that roller coaster of emotions.  People really, really like that one.  Very upset.  He'll come back.  He'll come back someday.  I'm sure he will.  Maybe after his Vegas trip.  You never know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It depends how Vegas goes.  Ah, yeah.  Vegas is that last minute city. 
[02:04:00]  Last minute city, Jimmy.  People are going to be buying some tickets for the big show.  That's the thing.  MGM?  Oh, you got the picture.  Yeah.  Oh, I've seen this.  You have?  Yes, I have.  It's fucking crazy, right?  Yeah, and it's labeled.  You know, the word epic, the word epic is overused these days in social media, but that is, that's  the only picture that they should describe as the only picture that they should describe as epic.  Oh, yes.  I hold the phone because there's pictures I don't want you to see in the air.  Can I see it?  No.  Please?  No.  Come on. 
[02:04:30]  I want to see you prick.  No, I don't have my prick.  You really don't?  I never saw someone hold their phone so tightly.  Let me see how many pictures back I have to go before I shouldn't have it.  All right.  One, two, three, four, five.  Oh, well, no.  You know what?  All these pictures from the show are here.  I swear I will block out the offensive part.  This is the photo I opened on.  Do you see my feet?  That's your feet?  Uh-oh.  Let me see.  Block out the offensive part. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  It's a mirror picture.  A mirror picture of Jimmy.  With my feet.  A rod?  No, but I have my rod.  I know.  Who are you sending that to?  I just took it.  I have an eclectic mix of pictures.  There's like kittens, movie pictures from like movies.  Yeah.  You're well-rounded.  You're Renaissance, man.  Vagina.  Yeah, there's some nudity.  Do girls like getting pictures of you? 
[02:05:30]  Of your parts?  I mean, it's nice to see girls' parts, but are guys' parts?  Some do, some don't.  But I never just send.  You have to be asked.  Oh, yeah, or I have to get one first.  I love a good dirty picture exchange.  Do you?  I tried sending one to my wife once, and she was like, what are you doing?  Really?  You don't want to hear, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Ew.  Exactly.  You sent a picture of your dick?  Yes.  And she's just like, what's wrong with you? 
[02:06:00]  That's great.  Wait, what were you guys talking about?  I was away.  And you just sent a picture of your cock?  I was just like, I missed you, and whatever.  And then I just sent a picture.  Oh, man.  What is wrong with you?  Did you feel like a complete?  I'm going to bed.  Oh, no, really?  Did you feel like a complete asshole?  A moron.  Like a moron.  That would have started a fight with me that would have been like a month long.  I was like, well, she's right.  Really?  And I'm going for the cheap plug, but you're in my tweet.  Oh, what?  Someone sent me the pic.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Mike did.  Yeah, Mike Cole.  Mikey did.  Oh, he sent it to you?  Yeah, yeah.  That son of a bitch sent you the picture but doesn't send me the picture?  Ah.  No, I tweeted it, and it's the picture Anthony's talking about.  Epic.  Yeah.  It is pretty fucking cool, man.  That really is an amazing picture.  You know who has the biggest balls in that picture?  The guy taking the picture.  Okay.  And I'm not even going through the joke, but what the fuck?  You're right.  That guy is more of a man than those two.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  That shit.  Because he has the balls to take the picture.  That is a wild picture out there.  It is, man.  Look at the mud.  He's just trudging his buddy out in the throat.  Mud's so fucking thick, that must have been hard to walk in.  And then the guy's, you know, got his pistol out.  Yeah.  30 years later.  Why is grandpa so cranky?  Fuck you, old man.  Like, every time I beep at some old dude I have, like, driving, I'm like, you fucking  piece of shit.  Get out of the way.  It could have been this guy. 
[02:07:30]  And you know, he's got an old man walker, and that's the reason.  Yeah.  That was the day he fucked up his back for the rest of his life.  That's right.  But then you find out what that picture really is, is they were just leaving a bar, and  he was shooting at some woman that wouldn't suck his dick in the men's room for him.  You fucking are!  Come on, Rob.  Let's go.  You've had enough, Rob.  You've had enough.  Don't put your army helmet on.  That looks silly.  You need to get mud in my new fucking pencil.  Really?  That's funny, man.  Some funny shit.  That's hardcore. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking crazy, man.  I don't know.  I don't know how they do it.  I love watching them shows that, the real life, like, combat footage and shit like that.  Yeah.  You just see those guys doing shit.  I can't even imagine.  Now we don't have that anymore.  Now it's just going to be internet fights.  Internet fight.  Well, did you see the one yesterday?  The two little girls fighting?  No.  Their parents, whatever it was.  I don't know.  These girls are probably six, seven. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  And their parents, I guess, their mothers, whatever it is, are cheering them on to fight  and start hitting each other.  Find that video, Sam.  They're like six.  Find that video.  Six years old?  What, did you go to World Star Hip Hop?  Yeah.  Did you assume that that's where it would be?  Did you assume that that's where that video would be?  Because they have to, yeah.  Just put in, you know, kids, parents fighting. 
[02:09:00]  My mother was in a...  I tweeted it yesterday, by the way.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Yes.  It's under...  I forgot.  I tweeted something like, oh, this figure or something.  My mother was just in a Walmart, and she just moved to a new town.  She went to a Walmart for the first time, and there's a mom with two little kids, like 
[02:09:30]  four and five, like in their cart.  And my mother's just like looking at the shelves, and the little four-year-old just looks at my  mother and goes, you bitch.  Holy shit.  And my mother's just like, what?  Holy shit.  And then the other girl, the other little girl goes, yeah, you bitch.  And the mom just kind of looked at my mother like, what are you going to do about it?  I fucking...  Do you know what would have happened to me if I even thought that word?  I know. 
[02:10:00]  Even if there was a bitch.  The mom was just like...  Yeah, yeah, you would still be slapped.  Like, you couldn't curse like that in front of your parents.  You'd be fucking dead.  To another grown-up.  Of course.  To a stranger.  Fuck.  Oh, here it is.  Okay, here's the video.  This is another big one.  I saw it on the news today.  This one's breaking on the news today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is the one that you saw censored or uncensored?  Censored.  Let's go uncensored.  There's beeps.  It's like you have a portal to the future news. 
[02:10:30]  I know.  Yes.  Yes.  It's really true.  I haven't seen the uncensored.  I read the newspapers out of habit.  It's all stuff we talked about yesterday.  It's all old stuff.  We're not easily a day ahead of the papers.  Completely.  And you can tell black women recorded this because, again, it's in portrait mode when  it should be in landscape mode.  I keep trying to tell the black folk, turn your phone sideways and your guns straight up  and down.  It's very different. 
[02:11:00]  It's how it works.  If they could just switch the two, the world would be a much better place.  Why can't the phones just figure that out, though?  Yeah.  They just do everything in landscape, no matter how you hold your fucking phone.  I know.  Sometimes you want a portrait mode, right?  Never.  No?  No.  Is this New York?  Yes.  Yeah.  New York.  Let's...  Upper West Side?  Doubtful.  Slap her.  Just slap her.  Just slap her.  That's two girls. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God.  They're face-to-face.  Just slap her.  Squaring off.  Slap her.  And the parents are totally egging them on to fight.  Yo, that kind of...  They don't even want to do it.  No, they don't want to do it.  How old are these kids?  Six and a half and seven.  Oh.  Whoop that ass.  Whoop that ass.  She's tapping her.  Do you?  Just do it.  Oh.  Kid fight.  Oh, my God. 
[02:12:00]  Grabbing your hair and just pulling you like a hockey fight.  Now they're spinning around with one hazard by the hair.  Both moms there?  Yeah.  That is ridiculous.  That's fucking savages.  Savages.  Yes.  It's disgusting.  The kids didn't even want to do it.  They don't.  They did not want to fight.  At the end of this, the one girl starts, like, screaming at the parents.  At the mother parents stop.  What am I talking about?  Yes.  Yes.  Whoop that ass. 
[02:12:30]  Whoop that ass.  There's so many people just standing around watching.  This is fucking disgusting.  It's so gross.  Whoop her ass.  Whoop her ass.  Whoop her ass.  These kids are doomed.  They're just fucking doomed.  This is what your mother taught you to do.  Now this kid's hilarious.  She's all upset and they're laughing. 
[02:13:00]  They're laughing and taking pictures of her.  Whoop her ass.  I'm not playing.  I'm not playing.  I'm not playing.  I'm not playing.  I'm not playing.  Shake off.  Shake off.  Shake off.  Shake off.  Shake off.  I'm not touching her.  I touch her.  I'll be like, dare on the floor.  No.  I ain't touching her.  Jeez.  Well, you wonder why in certain neighborhoods kids have fucked up this dog shit parent. 
[02:13:30]  Exactly.  What's that ass?  That's it.  What's that ass?  What's that ass?  God.  I hurt this little girl.  So her house.  It's not my.  I would go to jail for this little girl.  I would go to jail for this?  What?  What do you do?  Go to jail.  They take everything funny.  It ain't fucking funny.  They're all just laughing at her.  All these grown-ups are sitting around.  Yeah.  Just terrible.  Just laughing.  Fucking terrible.  That's so much worse than the sniper shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It really is.  There is such a fucking cultural problem that no one can address. 
[02:14:00]  That's disgusting.  Or you're called a racist.  That is insane.  That is a huge problem in the black community.  And all it takes is to, you know, there is such a multitude of these videos out there.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing how many videos of horror.  Horrid, horrid half-parenting that's going on.  So this isn't just a freak video?  No, no, no.  So many fights and fucking bullshit. 
[02:14:30]  But you know what?  No one wants to really talk about it or address it.  It's ridiculous.  It's so far from any kind of parenting.  That's not a way.  It's uncivilized behavior right there.  Man, oh man.  I was really shocked.  Like, I really am thrown, like, watching that guy's head get blown off by the sniper.  Yeah, that was one thing.  This is really disturbing.  Because you're going to run into these people on the subway.  Right? 
[02:15:00]  In your shows.  Just no regard for anything.  There's no fucking...  No.  Like, the thought of consequence does not even come into their fucking minds.  No.  Like, there's no big picture.  It's whatever at that very moment is happening is happening.  There's no consequence.  I see it all the time when you, you know, you see, like, certain crimes and...  If you watch First 48, that's a great show.  And the people are genuinely, like, upset in the interrogation room when they say what happened. 
[02:15:30]  It's like, didn't you think that was going to happen?  Right.  Didn't you think you'd be here under arrest for murder?  Right.  When you fucking just started shooting up and...  You just act on the emotion immediately.  Yes.  There's no thought at all.  There's no thought of consequence.  Sickening.  I can't believe all the people that weren't involved that weren't stopping it.  Just all those parents.  Yep.  I gotta ask you, as a parent, this shit got worse, right?  When you see this stuff?  What's that?  Does this shit get worse for you to watch? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, completely.  Yeah.  Like, it's obviously bad for any human being to check that shit out, but then...  No, yeah.  Something about being a parent on top of it just makes it worse.  No, because you immediately picture your little girl getting her hair pulled by these people.  I can't imagine how much.  How much would that annoy you if that was your daughter, like, having been egged on?  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  It would be instant rage.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, you talk about not thinking in the moment.  Oh, my God.  I would just...  You would just flip.  Anthony, I gotta blow up your spot.  I'm really sorry ahead of time.  What happened?  What happened? 
[02:16:30]  That picture's fake.  Oh, who said it's fake?  What?  No, and a link and everything.  Who said fake?  Totally fake.  I did, actually.  I said the first thing I said was...  It's, um...  Here is the...  The one with the gun?  Oh, no.  It looks like it was put together.  The quality is weird.  I wanted it to be real.  Oh, come on.  What is that?  That's the color photo.  The guy...  I'm reading quickly.  Was it Saving Private Ryan?  It's, uh...  He's an artist.  Realistic miniature war scenes. 
[02:17:00]  Miniature makes it so much worse.  You get all choked up over Hummels.  You didn't notice the afro in the kung fu grip?  Hummels!  I can't believe this GI character.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it says, well...  That's funny.  While we've seen our share of miniature people, we've never been privy to...  To heard the stories behind them.  That's what this article says.  That's all about to change with...  This intriguing new movie...  Marwin Call. 
[02:17:30]  The documentary is told through the eyes of Mark Hagenkamp.  A man who is...  That's real.  Who was beaten into a...  Was...  Was beaten into a brain...  Sorry.  Damaging coma.  By five men outside a bar in his hometown of Kingston, New York.  To rebuild his hand-eye coordination.  Deal with mental wounds of the attack.  And because he could not afford therapy, Mark built a one-sixth scale World War II era town in his backyard.  Which he called Marwin Call, it looks like. 
[02:18:00]  And then he acted like King Kong and stepped out of the buildings and went...  I'll tell you one thing.  In black and white, with a little fucking blur in that thing, that looks pretty World War II-ish.  It looks amazing.  The dogs that live in this town eerily represent his friends, his family, and even his attackers.  After a few years, Mark started taking pictures of his miniature scenes, and that's where the story took a dramatic turn.  Mark's photos were discovered by a prestigious New York gallery who instantly turned his private therapy into public works of art. 
[02:18:30]  This looks amazing.  He now has to choose between the safety of his fantasy life in Marwin Call and the real world that he's avoided since the attack.  Dude, that shit looks fucking real.  It's a documentary.  There's something about it that was weird, though.  The film was shot over a course of four years, see some of the amazing photos, and then watch the trailer below.  I'll have the link.  I'll tweet it.  Oh, that doesn't look real at all.  Those are G.I. Joes.  Yeah, that looks awful.  Oh, man.  Yeah, but then you throw it into black and white.  If you look close at that first one, his face does look a little weird. 
[02:19:00]  But I thought it was just because it was an old picture.  No, I knew it.  You knew, Jimmy.  No, you didn't.  You didn't know.  Something felt weird about it.  Your pants are on fire.  No, I'm not lying to this.  I lie about anything.  My HIV status.  Whatever else you want me to lie about, bro.  I'll never lie about that.  Oh, wow.  We'll find a real picture like that.  I'm sure it happens.  I guess soldiers aren't so brave after all.  No, fuck them.  Exactly.  Fuck them all.  Yeah.  Thanks to Airborne Ranger, who actually runs my website.  Oh, Killjoy.  He just tweeted it. 
[02:19:30]  I'll retweet his link to the story I sort of just read.  It's so fake.  Oh, well.  The mud is too clear.  There's something weird about the quality of the mud.  But I thought it was like, because some of those old World War II pictures have that weird look to them.  Not to my knowledge.  No?  You know an old man by the name of Woodsy Niles?  Not to my knowledge.  Oh.  Wow.  That's sad.  I thought soldiers were brave.  Sorry.  I thought they were brave.  Sorry.  But it turns out they're all pussies.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Can't get real shots of them because they're hiding.  Yeah.  Is that what it is? 
[02:20:00]  Exactly.  They're hiding.  Wow.  Look at him.  He's setting up his little G.I. Joe pictures.  Oh, my God.  What a buddy.  Wait.  Is this the trailer for the movie?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's keep going with this.  What the fuck?  What do we got beat up?  Look at this guy.  He's got like real people.  Meanwhile, back in Marwencore, the SS took me.  It tied me up.  Then it started to cut me.  Right here in the airport.  I put a scar down to my face because this side was damaged in real life.  All right.  He's fucking a lunatic. 
[02:20:30]  Ah, we all do.  He's doing.  He plays with dolls.  What the hell do I know?  Mark Hogan Camp was in a bar and a group of five individuals beat him senseless.  Wow.  And did some pretty bad damage to his brain.  Fuck, guys.  Jesus.  When the teenagers kicked my head to pieces.  Oh, boy.  I bet I could tell you.  All memory of everything.  Jesus.  We're a teen.  So he made a world of his own.  What's the first thing I got to work on?  That's my imagination. 
[02:21:00]  Everything's real.  The slide on the 45, the clip even comes out.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Everybody has a dream.  Everybody wishes they had a double.  They could do the things that they could never do.  There's always something going on in Marwencore.  I've taken place in many battles.  We usually come out on top.  The SS had me tied up.  The girls went into the church.  They eliminated the SS.  Her coming and saving me proved to me that she loved me. 
[02:21:30]  So this is my wife, Anna.  Anna's competition.  So he made up this whole world?  The Belgian witch of Marwencore.  And this is Asia Thoris' time machine.  It's called being a kook.  Astounding movie.  I just got turned on to a documentary.  I don't know who beat him up.  Yes.  This whole World War II regalia.  Like, oh, hey.  How's it going?  What's that all about?  I was just astonished by the realism and the feeling.  I felt like it was too amazing to not share with other people. 
[02:22:00]  You've never seen anything like it before.  Of an art gallery that wants to display my photos.  What is this leads to tension and it's bad for him to really make it to the city.  It's like this is the one last thing that I don't ever want taken from me.  Relax.  Sounds like Bobo.  Marwencore for me, for my therapy.  It gets stranger by the moment, doesn't it?  It's a little like Otto. 
[02:22:30]  Yes, but he's more mentally stable.  Marwen.  Wow.  What is it called again?  Weird name.  Marwencore or something like that.  M-A-R-W-E-N-C-O-L, I think.  Yeah.  Marwencore.  Marwencore.  Oh, I'm calling the motherfucker back.  So we got beaten up, lost his memory, and then created a whole new reality with little pictures.  With little guys.  Little guys.  And then we photographed the guys.  The guys. 
[02:23:00]  And we bought it hook, line, and stinker.  Only Ant did.  Yeah.  We're all onto the fucking scam.  What can I say?  We were just making Ant feel like.  What happened?  Ant so gullible.  I just want to be one of those guys.  It looked so cool.  You could turn out your little marionette doll.  It looked so real.  Jesus Christ.  I thought it was real.  He was so brave.  They were brave, but it turns out they're not.  They're not brave at all.  Jeepers. 
[02:23:30]  I'm just trying to find info on them.  So I guess we're just as manly as soldiers.  Just as.  Yes, we are.  This guy's name is Mark Hagenkamp.  We are.  Hagenkamp.  Exactly.  What kind of ice cream does he like?  I was going to say that's what.  I'm not going to say it.  I can't find any information on.  He plays with dolls.  Says his assailants.  What? 
[02:24:00]  Maybe I'll go with assailants.  Didn't he say the SS took me in real life?  We all.  I hope I'm wrong.  What?  I hope we're wrong.  Do you hope we're wrong?  I'm so hoping I'm right.  About what?  About what?  To reinforce my horrific fucking notions about certain people.  I'm trying to see what happens.  It's in Kingston, New York, too.  Kingston, New York.  Yeah, you might be right.  I may be crazy.  Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for. 
[02:24:30]  Sorry.  Turn off the line.  Tin, tin, tin.  Kind of enjoy our sing-alongs.  Oh, okay.  Don't try.  Hey, man.  Change me.  Mmm.  Dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  When I was in sixth.  It's Billy Joel Day.  When I was in sixth grade, this was a huge album.  I went to Sandy Vargas' birthday party.  That was real nice.  And everyone brought her this album.  Let's get like five copies of it.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a Piano Man album.  Last House Is Your Queer.  I like 52nd Street.  Ah, yeah.  The Big Shot.  Big Shot.  Didn't ya?  Didn't ya?  Yes.  Didn't ya?  Didn't ya?  In the rain. 
[02:25:30]  Man.  And you told me not to drive.  But I made it home alive.  So you said that only proves that I've been saved.  Say.  You may be right.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I may be crazy.  I don't know.  But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.  I got the answer.  Turn out of the light.  Turn out of the light.  Yes.  Where? 
[02:26:00]  Where'd you get the answer?  I just got it.  By who?  11 years ago.  Not believing you.  Here's why he was beaten up.  Was he an asshole?  They said he has total, he's a total alcoholic.  He was in a bar.  Uh-huh.  And he confided in a man that he was a cross-dresser.  Oh.  That man and four of his friends beat this guy up terribly.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  I'm not saying who the idiot is right there.  See what I did?  Wait.  Wait the five seconds.  No, this is a-  Wait the five seconds.  I wish I made that up.  You're hiding behind a mic, though. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  What a liar.  He's a liar.  He's a liar.  No, I'm just a really good actor.  He's really good, but he's got tells.  Why would he hide behind the microphone?  It's so hard for him to hold it.  You see, some people just don't.  This guy won't crack.  Give him a minute.  Some people just don't know what a good actor I am.  Oh, really?  Of course.  Some people don't know that when I hide behind the mic and give the little silly laugh.  11 years ago, when he confided to a stranger in a bar that he was a cross-dresser, he was 
[02:27:00]  acting again, and he was really telling the truth.  Jimmy, wow.  That's what I do.  Wow.  That's what I do, because I've been in a similar pickle.  You know what I like to do?  Yes.  Well, I actually confided that I was attracted to someone who just admitted they were a cross-dresser.  You've got to think he hates panties at this point.  Wow.  I don't think he wears them anymore.  Nope.  Beat the guy up like that.  What fucking sex?  So they were homophobes.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  I gotcha.  Wow.  That's too bad.  Who cares?  Who wants to expel so much energy in, like...  Beating people up.  Beating people up over that.  We're getting angry over something ridiculous.  I like to wear a dress.  Exactly.  Gives a shit.  Who would waste that much time being addicted to anger so much?  Oh.  Well, why would you offer that?  That they would get so mad at something so irrational.  See, Jimmy, I, on the other hand, am passionate about certain things.  Passionate. 
[02:28:00]  I have a passion, but I don't go beating people up.  Well, why would you tell people you're wearing some shit?  Why wouldn't you just let a little out, just in case there's somebody around?  Like, leave a little sexy.  Yeah, just a little.  He bends over, and you see the top of the thong, like...  The teabags!  The teabags, dude!  Ew, he would say teabags?  Yeah.  Rocco loved the word teabag.  You know what I like to do?  What?  I like to wear ladies' clothes. 
[02:28:30]  Get them!  Get them, guys!  Get them!  How insane is that?  It started off with a conversation about Ed Wood's movies.  Yeah, what feelings are you pushing down?  Oh, my God.  That's your trigger.  All right, now we have to pretty much kill this guy.  Kill this guy, and then masturbate in the woods.  Any time you get somebody that beats up a gay guy, it's just, they are so confused.  Just repressed.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  They're just angry cocksuckers. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, gee.  Ridiculous.  With that, why don't we go to break?  I think we've got to say goodbye to Jimmy.  He's got a Vegas fucking plane to catch.  What?  Why?  Wait, what?  Unless you're sticking around for a little longer.  I have a flight that's leased before 11.  Oh.  Wow, you're pushing it.  We didn't have many options today.  Jimmy is playing the MGM Grand in Vegas tomorrow and Saturday.  With David Tell.  With David Tell.  It's going to be a great show.  And the Somerville Theater, March 29th.  I'm shooting a special in Boston.  It's not that big a theater.  It's two shows on Friday the 29th. 
[02:29:30]  Tickets go on sale in one hour on Ticketmaster.  And I'm thinking it will sell pretty well.  Can we go up there?  Yeah.  They want us to, actually.  I know.  The day before.  Isn't there like Good Friday, though?  And then you've got the Easter Sunday around there.  Well, Good Friday is the show.  But, I mean, I'm not worried about doing a Good Friday show.  I think it'll be great.  What about Easter, though?  What are we going to do for Easter?  Come home.  On Saturday.  What the fuck?  What if I want to stay up there?  Maybe I stay up there for Easter.  Well, how will the bunny find you?  That's a good point.  Do we get Monday off for Easter Sunday? 
[02:30:00]  Not traditionally.  Just take it off.  No, I don't give a shit.  No, but, I mean, you can relax on Easter.  Yeah.  Have some chocolates.  Hollow chocolate.  Hollow chocolate.  I don't believe it.  I loved fucking biting into that rabbit ear thing.  And it's just clunk.  Makes that clunk hollow sound.  And it just tastes all chocolatey.  Chocolate rabbits suck.  Why?  Let's be honest with each other.  You're a snob.  You get the solid one.  It tastes plastic. 
[02:30:30]  Plasticky.  That's the Dwayne Reads one.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Oh, you gotta go to, like, Lilac Chocolates or one of the fanciest places.  My ex used to love Peeps.  I love Peeps.  They're terrible.  Some people like fresh Peeps.  I love the Peeps.  Some people like them when they're still.  They make every color.  Every color and every holiday.  Peeps.  Whoa.  Peeps.  You don't like a good Peep?  No, I don't.  Hey.  I don't like any food I can fucking sop up a spill with.  Fucking Peeps can sop my dick, eat my ass.  I think it's hilarious some of these companies have finally fucking figured it out. 
[02:31:00]  Because Peeps, everyone just goes for around Easter.  And the company's like, oh, it's too bad that we can only make them around Easter.  Once a year.  And then finally they figured out, like, what?  We can make them all year long.  Just fucking change them into different shit.  But no one really gets them throughout the year.  They're starting to.  I saw some Frankensteins.  Yeah, they do a little Halloween Peeps.  You've got to have kids.  Yeah, they do peppermint ones for Christmas.  Peppermint.  There you go.  See?  Do you like Peeps?  I hate Peeps.  Yeah, they're terrible.  Watch your mouth. 
[02:31:30]  I'd prefer just full-on looks.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Tom Papa's going to be at the Stress Factory this weekend.  It's called Vinnie Brand Stress Factory.  Oh, Vinnie Brand Stress Factory.  See, I had no idea where you were even talking about.  No, no.  I hope that he winds up now from now on, has six people in every show, because nobody would think  the Stress Factory moved, and then some idiot took it over.  Oh, this guy's going to ruin it.  Who's this Vinnie Brand guy?  Vinnie Brand?  That was a good club.  I like the Stress Factory, but the Vinnie Brand Stress Factory. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, boy.  Tonight?  Tonight, tomorrow night, and Saturday.  And Saturday.  Saturday.  Three nights of shows in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  All right, we go to break with some Black History stuff.  This year we're...  It's Black History Month.  Yeah, this year we're celebrating inventions.  Yeah.  Black guys inventing shit.  Oh.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the 
[02:32:30]  great African-American inventors.  Today we honor John W. Reed, inventor of the rolling pin.  Welcome to Reed's Bakery.  What you looking for?  I've just heard wonderful things about your place.  My wife and I have a whole list of goods to buy, but I do have a question.  So I ask you, son.  How on earth do you get your dough so flat and smooth?  I'm a genius, nigga.  I invented this.  Call that shit a rolling pin.  Ugh.  Wow.  That really is ingenious. 
[02:33:00]  Fuck yeah.  Good for knocking niggas out, too.  How so?  Yo, Mrs. Asshole.  Yes?  Get over this counter and suck these nuts.  I thought you'd never ask.  The Rolling Pin.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here. 
[02:33:30]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about his favorite photograph.  Yeah, that's Teddy.  That's Teddy and his little brother.  The one on the other side's the girl.  She's kind of tomboyish.  She likes to play basketball.  Have her socks taken off.  Coochie-coo.  You tickle him in a tub.  Oh, Uncle Paul, my feet are dirty. 
[02:34:00]  You wash them.  Get them in a tub.  Clean their feet good.  Take your shorts off.  Let me kiss your toes.  Oh, yeah.  They all had to stay in my bed, cause they all had bed bugs in their cribs.  Come in here, so there's no bed bugs.  And then them goddamn parents are accusing me, saying, how come he ain't walking right?  I don't know.  I didn't do nothing.  Bunch of lies.  Those damn denar tests.  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney. 
[02:34:30]  I don't know what that means.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  3-6-7.  3-6-7.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:35:00]  Pearl Jam Day.  Oh.  Which one's this?  Spin the Black Circle.  Oh.  Travis picked this one, really?  Real toe-tapper.  No kidding.  Off of my tower.  Yes, it is.  Uh-huh.  Are you a Pearl Jam fan, Tom Papa?  Yeah, I like Pearl Jam.  And it doesn't like them.  I like the hits.  I like the songs we've heard a thousand times. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then you go off the rails and it gets a little weird.  Yeah, then it's like.  What about elderly woman behind the counter in a small town?  No.  Probably my favorite.  Yeah.  Our same to recognize.  We've done this.  I know.  Yeah, you're right.  Don't even wait for us anymore. 
[02:36:00]  We had a bet back here waiting to see how long it would take open to say that song or  Yellow Lead Better.  Yellow Lead Better?  I like that one.  That's great.  We've done this.  We've done this.  I like Release Me.  I like Just Breathe.  Those are some of my favorites.  They're a little slower.  I like the slower stuff.  What about.  What about.  Yeah, you're right.  Don't even wait for us to ask anymore.  Just go.  We did this.  You're getting a live cut. 
[02:36:30]  Oh.  Familiar yet?  Yeah.  My wife finally tapped out.  I like this one.  My wife finally tapped out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the only channel I listen to on Sirius XM.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I think the rest of it is all horse shit.  I like how that channel was supposed to be like a little micro channel.  Yeah.  It's supposed to have a limited run.  Yeah.  And then everyone loved it, so they just made it an official channel.  They got to be paying those guys a lot of money, man. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  But my wife finally tapped out.  She begs me now.  No, please.  Anything but the Pearl Jam channel.  And she never really.  Why does she not like it?  Because I play it all the fucking time.  Just beat her over the head with it.  Yeah, in general, she's fucking cool, but that one finally got to her.  She's like, enough already.  Please.  Do you ever see Iconoclasts on Sundance Channel?  No.  They take two artists who don't really know each other, kind of each other, and put them 
[02:37:30]  together, and they spend the day, and it's a really cool series.  Really?  Well, they did Eddie Vedder, and who's the famous surfer?  Laird?  Laird.  You know, the guy who does, like, all those monster waves.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  The blonde guy.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  Fucking, man, let me see somebody popping up over here.  Spicoli?  Well, Eddie Vedder and him went to Laird Hamilton?  Laird Hamilton, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  So they're in Hawaii hanging out, and they're, like, meeting each other.  They kind of know each other, and they go up in a helicopter, and they see a double rainbow,  and they come back down.  It was, like, a full circle, and they come down, and Eddie Vedder's, like, it was the  most beautiful thing I've ever saw.  And you're just, I don't know, like, wow, he's really losing it.  You realize, oh, he's in Hawaii with this great surfer.  He's baked.  He's totally stoned.  Oh, man.  Freaking out about this rainbow. 
[02:38:30]  Is there a clip?  I got it.  Is there a clip to this?  Oh, man.  It's just a high-code movie.  If you can find the rainbow thing, that'd be great.  I got to hear it now.  Double rainbow.  I never saw it.  It was so beautiful.  I saw it from the helicopter.  Double rainbow.  Oh, man.  But at first you weren't, you couldn't figure it out, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Hawaii. 
[02:39:00]  He's really into this.  Oh, he's stoned.  Surfer, Hawaii.  Okay.  Nice.  And then it got awkward.  Then he sang some song about surfing for Laird Hamilton.  It was kind of weird.  He doesn't offer up much, Eddie Vedder.  Yeah.  About his personal life.  A little bit here and there.  Have you interviewed him?  Hell no.  He doesn't ever stop by?  Hell fucking no.  He doesn't even stop by.  Do you do interviews?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't have to.  I did Fallon. 
[02:39:30]  I want to see this show now.  He did Fallon.  It's a great show.  Iconoclast.  Nice.  Eddie Vedder looks the same.  He really...  Yeah, he does.  It's kind of creepy.  I know.  Must be all that red wine he drinks.  Early 90s, you look at Eddie Vedder, and you look at him now...  I know.  I mean, you can tell, obviously, he's older, but it's not like that bad, like, oh, boy.  Yeah.  It's within range of what he used to look like.  He's not getting weird looking.  He's still got all the hair.  Still got the full head of hair.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  I think that's the key.  It really is, because if you're one of those rockers that, like, uh-oh, you can kind of  see it early on.  You're like, uh-oh.  This could be a problem in a couple of years.  David Lee Roth, we're talking about you.  Yeah.  I'm going...  I'm going to do the bald look.  We're going to be...  Yeah.  I think David Lee Roth is finally coming in here.  Oh, yeah?  What?  Yeah.  Whoa!  Yeah?  He was showing up at the Comedy Cellar for a while, because he lived in the neighborhood, 
[02:40:30]  and...  Really?  That's when he was working for the EMT.  He was, like, working in the ambulance stuff.  Yeah.  And he would just stop, and he just...  Was he actually working for that?  I think he was.  Totally.  Yeah.  No, they say he was, but was he actually going on calls and stuff?  Yeah, he said he was.  Fucking ambulances, going on calls.  Crazy, right?  Yeah.  The fuck?  Your life is being...  Your life is in jeopardy, and all of a sudden...  Wow!  David Lee Roth shows up.  The guy that's saying he ain't talking about love.  That guy.  Yeah.  Just a gigolo.  Holy fuck, man.  It's amazing.  The gigolo guy is fucking taking your vitals. 
[02:41:00]  I'm dying.  Yeah.  I just got bored, huh?  Yeah.  Rock star.  Yeah.  He's living downtown.  I've heard it a million times, but I just wondered if he was actually all in with that shit.  Hey, relax.  Try not to talk.  That was a fucking hallucination.  David Lee Roth was fucking...  I'm playing.  I got this! 
[02:41:30]  Clear!  Clear!  Scoopity-boopity-pop!  Have we done this either?  No.  There we have.  Not since we took over a slot.  Because then I'm going to bring up one of my favorite David Lee Roth songs.  Oh.  Who's driving this thing?  Which is a song called Damn Good. 
[02:42:00]  Another slow one.  I like the slow ones.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of the slow ones.  Ooh, what are you doing?  Do you want me to play Damn Good?  Eddie Vedder's not working for the ambulance.  No, no.  Brr, brr, brr, what?  Brr, brr.  I don't think they'll appreciate Damn Good.  It's one of those songs where you reflect a little bit.  What?  Damn Good.  You know what?  Eddie Vedder, Eddie Van Halen?  I mean, David Lee Roth.  Yeah, when he was doing Soul thing.  Yeah.  Off Skyscraper. 
[02:42:30]  This brings me back to WCMF, the home of rag and roll.  Wow.  Damn good.  David Lee Roth.  Really?  Damn good.  Yeah, this was a hit for CMF up there in Rochester.  I kind of remember this.  I liked it a lot, actually.  It's a pussy song, though.  I'll beat the Twitter haters to it.  Who was his guitarist doing this?  I don't know.  It's a remake of an Indio song, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was from Canada.  Died in Belfast.  Guy's playing his fucking instrument, though. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  You don't hear that shit these days.  Was it Steve Vai?  Might have been.  He did some shit with Steve Vai, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve Vai.  The harmonic.  Fucking.  Ooh.  Not bad, right?  It's good.  Yeah, this shit sounded pretty fucking good.  Where's Davey?  Turn this up.  There's still five minutes.  Five minutes.  That's silly.  And he can almost sing it. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, he's not talking his way through this.  He can almost sing.  Go.  One break coming up.  He would have killed for auto tune.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we played a lot off this album.  Just like Paradise.  Where's the hook?  Does his own backup.  Yeah.  What happened to the reunion? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy.  No one's talking.  Yeah.  I mean, David Lee Roth made a video in the woods or something saying, hey, we're going to be back.  Yeah.  And then they officially said no.  And we said it.  We're like, okay, they fucking hate each other.  Yeah.  They're trying to cool off to see if they can figure this shit out.  And we even said it on our show.  Give it a month or two.  And this thing is canceled.  Everyone's calling us.  No fucking way, dude.  You know, they got sold out shows all over the place. 
[02:44:30]  They're not going to just give up on that.  And then nothing.  Nothing, man.  They canceled the entire fucking tour.  That's deep hate.  Yeah.  They can't even fucking be in the same room.  They can't even be on the same stage together for a couple hours.  Here's a couple million dollars.  All you have to do is tour for one summer.  Yeah.  I can't do it.  And here's a fuckload of money to do it.  I can't do it.  No.  I can't look at that guy's face.  Who do you think the problem is, though?  Because, I mean, yeah, but the Van Halen brothers could be a little dicky themselves. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Aren't they drug addicts?  I don't know.  Allegedly.  Enjoy the lawsuit.  All right.  Enjoy the lawsuit.  He was asking a question.  I was asking a question.  He said, aren't they drug addicts?  Yeah.  That's what I heard, allegedly.  Tom knows this game.  As long as you're peppering allegedly, you're pretty good.  Aren't they drug addicts?  Allegedly?  Aren't they bank robbers?  Or just make it sound like a question. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  That and allegedly will teach out a lot of shit.  Aren't they?  Couldn't they?  Wouldn't they?  Don't they rob banks?  That's it.  Don't they?  Yeah.  Question mark?  The MTV appearance where David Lee Roth just took it way too far.  Oh, yeah.  They were testing the waters and David Lee Roth is basically saying, yep, we're back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Van Halen brothers looked at him like, what the fuck?  Here we go again.  We just agreed to do this together.  Yeah.  But no one's doing anything.  That's right.  I mean, none of them perform. 
[02:46:00]  No.  I was talking to Red Eye's Greg Gutfeld last night after the taping.  And we were talking about David Lee Roth and the fact that all the years and all the rock  and roll and groupies and parties and things you heard, you never heard of him with a girl.  You just never.  Right.  No tabloid stuff.  Yeah.  There wasn't any pictures of, you know, here's Dave on a day off.  Right.  Walking hand in hand with his girl down to just never.  That's a good point.  Which leads people always to speculate about someone's sexuality. 
[02:46:30]  Sure.  Isn't he gay?  Oh, my God.  It's a question.  It's a question I'm asking.  Doesn't he have a boyfriend?  Doesn't he?  Couldn't he possibly?  No, he can't be.  He sang about girls.  That's true.  Listen.  This song right along.  Him and Pete Townsend.  And they're always busty girls.  People are saying enough with the music. 
[02:47:00]  How dare you?  Assless chaps.  Yes.  Although we're fucking up Pearl Jam Day.  Yes, we are.  Yeah.  We're deluding it.  What?  This is better.  I have to say.  Woo!  Woo!  This may be a problem with Pearl Jam Day because we've.  Went off into Billy Joel.  Now we're off into this because we get bored with the Pearl Jam Day.  Sorry. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Just happens.  No, we didn't.  Because as E-Rock points out, we've done it before.  There's something else that was going on.  Oh!  Assless chaps.  I don't know why we haven't talked about it until this very moment.  The body they found at the L.A. hotel.  What?  Right, right.  Holy fuck.  Did you read this story yet?  No.  Found in a water tank, right?  Corpse found in L.A. hotel's water tank.  Tourist staying.  This is where it's like, holy fuck.  Tourist staying at a Los Angeles hotel drank water from a tank in which a young woman's 
[02:48:00]  body was likely decomposing for more than two weeks.  And the only reason they discovered that this body was because people were complaining  about the water going.  It tastes funny.  Oh my God!  Yes.  Do we have.  Go to.  No.  Whoa.  Go to CNN.com.  It's on their front page.  I think there's audio of the story.  Dude, that's fucked.  Yes.  Yes.  Brought to you by Poland Spring.  What hotel?  What hotel was it?  Bottle water, motherfucker.  God.  Who drinks the water out of the tap in a hotel anyway? 
[02:48:30]  Exactly.  It's always the bottle of water or the minibar.  Yeah.  I've never been that desperate.  That shit.  Yeah, man.  But supposedly they complained about the taste of the water.  So they probably said, well, it might be something in the tank.  Let's look.  And then there's some fucking floating corpse decomposing.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  With nights at seven.  Very brunette.  What the?  It tasted horrible.  It had very funny, sweet, disgusting taste.  Sweet.  It's very, very strange taste. 
[02:49:00]  I can barely describe it.  How are you not just vomiting?  Tourists from the UK never imagined the source of that indescribable taste.  And that it would trace back to 21-year-old Elisa Lam.  The tourist from Vancouver, Canada came to Los Angeles January 26th.  She was thirsty 10 minutes later.  She checked in at the Cecil Hotel.  Surveillance video from the hotel's elevators show her acting unusual, as if she's hiding from someone.  Then Lam disappeared January 31st.  The boss never saw Lam, but knew something at their hotel was off. 
[02:49:30]  There was something wrong.  The pressure in the water was terrible.  The shower was awful.  Oh, the shower was dead.  Body water.  Yes, complaints went to check the four rooftop tanks that feed the building's main water supply.  Tanks that are unlocked, but the rooftop is locked.  No tanks.  How about that?  The maintenance man found Lam's body inside one of the tanks at the bottom.  It made me feel really sick.  Yes.  Inside job.  Who hauls a body up to the top of the water tank?  Inside job. 
[02:50:00]  Some of the worst of the hotel.  You think?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Who gets that idea?  Give it a couple days.  Inside job.  That's pretty good, though, because you're-  Maintenance guy, or maybe someone that does work here and there for the hotel.  When it's in there a while, you're getting rid of some of the evidence, you know?  Some of the DNA evidence, some of the other physical evidence.  She's in that water tank.  Yeah, that's probably a good place to dump a body that you killed.  Not really.  Why?  It's not going to decompose fully, and they're going to taste the fucking bad water eventually. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, but you know what?  This guy maybe wanted a week or two to get the fuck out of the country.  Exactly.  And like I said, a lot of that evidence gets washed away when it's in that-  Oh, God.  They were showering in dead body water.  Decomposing dead body water.  Yeah, that's-  What?  For almost a month.  A month?  She disappeared on the 30th of January.  30th of January.  Yeah, that's two weeks.  Wow.  Three weeks.  21st of February.  That's crazy. 
[02:51:00]  A couple days ago.  Let's go with two weeks.  It's really not a month.  Yeah.  It's nowhere near as long.  Let's hear the rest of this technically closer to a month.  It's really not a month.  Two and a half weeks is more than halfway through.  But it's not near almost.  And that's giving you the half a week.  That's about a half a month.  Yeah.  I think you're just counting because February's short.  Don't argue with the boss.  Yeah.  Three weeks in February.  It's like-  No, it's four weeks in February.  Four weeks or-  Five.  Let's keep listening because this is gross.  So gross.  It made me feel really sick yesterday and until now, 
[02:51:30]  knowing that we've been drinking this water for eight days.  Makes you feel physically sick.  Literally physically sick.  But more than that, you feel psychologically.  You think about it and it's not good.  The LA County Department of Public Health says a hotel was immediately-  You fucking couldn't.  A place on a flush-only order, but not order to shut down.  A reasonable solution, says the health department, if the hotel provides bottled water.  The hotel would not speak to CNN on or off camera, but it did notify guests about a, quote, 
[02:52:00]  health and safety condition.  Guests tell us if they leave, they don't get a refund.  If they stay, they must sign this legal agreement, releasing the hotel of legal liability.  Fuck yeah!  It says if guests stay, quote, you do so at your own risk and peril.  What are these gruesome-  Pause.  What are-  Pause now.  That was a video issue, obviously.  Oh.  Pause.  Pause.  Pause. 
[02:52:30]  Pause.  We'll pause.  Why wouldn't any of these places take responsibility?  Ridiculous.  The cruise ship people, the fucking water tank people.  Right.  You can't, like, you can't have people signing away their shit because there's a dead body  in your water tank.  You should agree to those terms.  What the-  Yeah, of course.  Especially not knowing the circumstances that if it is an inside job and they hired somebody  that perhaps was not to fucking, shouldn't have been hired, then they are liable and 
[02:53:00]  negligent, perhaps.  So why would you sign away your right to any kind of litigation before you even know if  the hotel is responsible in some way, shape, or form?  Right.  Yeah.  And it's like, how bad do you want to stay in that hotel?  It's like a dump anyway.  It looks like a shitty fucking hotel.  I just want to stay in the Hotel Cecil so badly.  I'm probably named after DeMille's there, though.  I thought it was a big beanie end.  Oh, boy.  That's going back a ways.  If you're a film buff.  Yes.  Let's get to the rest of this. 
[02:53:30]  End of this.  Look how high those tanks are, though.  They really are.  Big tanks.  You've got to climb up there with a body.  Dump her in.  All right.  This is a good line.  This is a good line.  All right.  This is a good line, Phil and Yonkers.  Go ahead, sir.  Hey, at least you know those Brits weren't brushing their teeth with that water.  Boy, they will never live down that whole scurvy thing, will they?  Holy shit, the Brits.  We're jack-o-lantern, people.  Also coming in, new meaning to the upper-decker.  Oh, wow. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that is the ultimate upper-decker.  All right.  What do we got left here?  This is the latest chapter in a dark history for the Cecil Hotel.  At least two serial killers have lived here, including night stalker Richard Ramirez, found  guilty of killing 13 people in the 1980s.  He lived on the 14th floor of the hotel.  Oh, my God.  He was living here during his killing spree, going out at night and killing people.  And so this is just the latest unusual chapter in the story history.  It is. 
[02:54:30]  And I think it's the sort of thing that's going to be hard to forget because it's just such  a graphic and disturbing story.  And I hope that we find out what happened.  No, they'll forget because they had a serial killer living there.  And, you know, fast forward a bunch of years.  Yeah, no one knew.  People are using it as their place to, you know, stay.  Wow.  Someone just got added to the ghost tour.  Yes, definitely.  That fucking Hearst tour that they take around.  I love it.  You do it ever?  No.  I did it.  You did?  Everyone gives you the finger.  Oh, God.  The locals hate those people.  It was an old company. 
[02:55:00]  I think there's a new company that...  Yeah, that's right.  Fuck.  Someone that is in the know told me they finally had to get rid of the Hearst because the locals  literally were trying to run them off the road.  So they would give them the finger like, fuck you.  This is our history.  So they finally went with the old school tour bus.  So you don't know it's the ghoulish tour.  Ladies and gentlemen, as we come around the corner here, the latest addition to our tour,  this hotel, a body was found in the water towers.  You can see them right up there.  We'll stop for a photo moment. 
[02:55:30]  A body was found in there.  People in the hotel actually drinking the water from this hotel.  Wow.  Take a picture of me.  Take a picture of me.  But at least the Brits don't have to worry about brushing their teeth.  Okay.  As we continue on, here's where Vivian Vance dropped in.  And they would stop in front of these old hotels and these old residents, and then they  would have to start...  It was a cassette tape back then, and there'd be some music from The Wizard of Oz. 
[02:56:00]  You're like, oh, this is so nice.  Here it comes.  This is so nice.  And then it's like, do you remember the good witch from The Wizard of Oz?  Well, one morning she woke up, took a shower, put all her makeup on and her nicest dress,  and then proceeded to take a plastic bag and strangle herself.  Oh.  The body was found eight months later in this very spot.  Hollywood.  Right.  Hollywood.  And poor Fred Mertz from I Love Lucy.  Yeah, he was.  He was a throwaway because we were at a red light. 
[02:56:30]  He goes, oh, might as well tell you while we're stuck in this red light.  You see that sidewalk right there?  And it was the walk of fame shit.  Yeah, yeah.  With the stars.  He goes, right there on the corner, Fred Mertz was coming out of a premiere and dropped dead of a heart attack.  No.  Oh, light's green.  Let's move on to the next location.  Poor Bill Frawley.  If he hadn't stopped at the light, they wouldn't have even mentioned it.  No, that was kind of a throwaway because there's so much shit.  Fred Mertz died like that?  That's what they said.  Poor Fred.  Coming out of a movie premiere.  Oh, Fred. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, Rick.  Oh, yeah.  Couldn't think of it.  Hollywood Boulevard.  Yes.  Oh, Fred.  Hollywood Boulevard.  There was a movie that was totally based on the fact that there was some body in a water tower.  I think it was supposed to have taken place on, like, Roosevelt Island or something.  Oh, yeah.  There was a movie.  If somebody on Pal Talk wants to earn their fucking keep, these fucking freeloading pricks.  And, like, pop that up.  Yeah.  There was a movie about the same thing? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, there was a...  While they try to find this, it looks like Sam found a pretty cool site.  No, it wasn't Petticoat Junction.  The Karen Carpenter 30th Deathiversary Carpentor.  Dark Water.  Yeah, this place does all the death tours.  They do the...  Dark Water.  The Deathiversary of Karen Carpenter.  They do the Helter Skelter tour.  All right.  Well, the Helter Skelter tour, they tore down the house.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  They did?  Yeah.  Which one?  Where it all happened.  Well, what's the Helter Skelter tour? 
[02:58:00]  Is that Charlie Manson or what?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, but then they killed the other people the next night.  They just drive you around and...  Yeah.  La Bianca's.  Yeah.  What do you get on the Karen Carpenter death tour?  What do you get to see?  You get to...  All the food she didn't eat?  Empty cabinets.  You can...  A brand new fridge.  You can erase cake.  Still sparkling.  That movie was called Dark Water.  Thank you.  Dark Water.  Dark Water.  And it was, indeed... 
[02:58:30]  I guess it's a spoiler if you want to watch it.  There's a body in the fucking water tank.  Oopsie.  All right.  Sorry about that.  I think it's a body of a young girl or something.  What do you get there, Sam Roberts?  You can ooh and ah over the bathroom sink from Karen's last home.  Oh.  Her last puke, I thought.  And then, indeed, Petticoat Junction did have those hot girls in the water tank there.  They were bathing.  Petticoat Junction.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, remember at the beginning?  No.  Petticoat Junction, they showed the girls, and they were in the water tank, and then 
[02:59:00]  they grabbed the towels and flip them off.  Oh, yeah.  And it's like, uh-huh.  Right.  Come ride a little train, and they're rolling down a track to the junction.  Petticoat Junction.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  Breaking.  Breaking news.  That tasted like...  Breaking news.  Oh, but she said it was sweet.  No.  Like there...  Oh, how is it sweet?  It's kind of sweet.  Ew, is death sweet?  Oh, man.  Is death too sweet?  She's Asian.  Oh, my God.  Sweet and sour.  Oh, God. 
[02:59:30]  Ta-da!  Da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Yikes.  Hollywood.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I call it Holly weird.  Whoa.  Fucking good one, Coolvia.  Thanks, Chip.  It's not here.  I have to stand in.  Van Halen just announced dates in Japan and Australia, supposedly, according to this guy  on Twitter.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  He's got an egg for his avatar picture, so I don't believe in those people.  I don't believe in me either.  I don't follow egg people. 
[03:00:00]  They're liars.  Now...  They're all liars and haters and phonies.  Yeah, they are.  And then Sammy Hagar comes in and he can't get along, so maybe the problem is the brothers.  Maybe it's the Van Halens.  Well, because Sammy took the other guy there.  Yeah.  Michael Anthony.  Right.  He took Michael Anthony.  Michael Anthony didn't want anything to do with the big VH reunion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't even have to tour.  All Sammy does is play down at the Cabo Wabo place.  Right.  All right.  We get it.  He sells his tequila and fucking plays at his own place. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's carved out a cool little life for himself.  How old is he these days?  He's got to be pushing 65.  Dude, I would say older.  Older?  I think so.  Because he was a bit older.  He can't drive 55.  No.  Who can, though?  He, uh...  One foot on the brake and one on the gas.  How about the I Can't Drive 75?  Right.  55, really?  55!  What's the speed limit?  He's crazy.  He's speeding.  He's nuts.  He's so crazy.  Hey, he's a man-man. 
[03:01:00]  The Red Rocker?  The Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar.  Why are you playing this song for the Red Rocker?  Yeah, what is it?  You said Cabo Wabo.  This is tequila and stuff.  Oh, I hate that.  Oh, good.  What's the guest's age?  Uh, 67.  68.  That's too old.  I'm going to go to 64.  You know what?  I said push in 65.  He is 65.  What?  Thank you very much.  Hollywood.  Do you know who...  Thank you very much. 
[03:01:30]  Tom Popper, do you know who is 79 years old?  Who?  Tom Skerritt.  What?  Can you fucking believe it?  No way.  I know, right?  79?  The guy's fucking one year to 80.  He was fucking Dallas in Alien.  Yeah.  And he had a little salt and pepper in his beard.  He's one of those guys that were a little older than he looked back then.  Right.  So it seemed like he got real old real fast.  I swear.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Tom Skerritt.  Well, do you think that now, since he looks okay for 79, that he's going to get old and 
[03:02:00]  senile really quick?  Like, he stopped aging again.  I don't know.  And then it's going to...  Who are we talking about?  Tom Skerritt?  Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt.  Look at him in Alien.  It's the middle picture on top row.  I know.  He was badass.  Yeah, he was badass then.  See?  He sort of...  And then he winds up getting killed and everybody's like, holy shit, he's the hero of the movie.  And then it turns out to be Ripley.  But that movie was like in the 20s?  Yeah.  Actually, it was Claymation.  Right.  He used it.  So the special effects. 
[03:02:30]  It was the same people I worked on.  King Kong.  King Kong.  It is one of my favorite movies.  He's so old.  He's so old.  Tom Skerritt.  79 years old.  I heard that he was going out on tour with Van Halen.  Yeah.  Really?  Apparently he's going to be singing.  Tom Skerritt.  Wow.  I guess Top Gun is coming out in 3D.  Yeah.  They remastered it and everything.  And, of course, the role of Viper, played by Tom Skerritt. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  Oh.  He was in that one, too.  He pretty much told Maverick, I flew with your dad.  You know, you got some issues, but you could get through them.  You're a fucking good pilot.  I'm going to take the role of it, Rock.  Not only have we already done this bit.  Yeah.  It was yesterday.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Not really.  Not really.  What bit?  Skerritt?  Tom Skerritt.  And Top Gun.  And Top Gun, but we never really delved into the 3D aspects of Top Gun.  True.  It's a new issue. 
[03:03:30]  We should say that the volleyball scene would be really hot in 3D.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  With the shirtless volleyball scene.  Well, not everyone was shirtless.  Anthony Edwards refused.  What a jerk.  What a jerk.  What was wrong with his chest, do you think?  Caved in?  Three nipples?  Yeah, maybe.  Well, he wasn't as in shape as all the rest of the guys.  I like how.  He had just come off of the nerds movies.  Right.  You know.  Where he had to soften up.  Yeah, yeah.  He couldn't be a ripped nerd.  I like how they can reissue a 30-year-old movie, but we can't talk about it twice. 
[03:04:00]  How Tom Cruise is able to look all muscular looking at his watch.  He was flexing looking at his watch.  He's like, yeah, let me look at my watch.  There they go.  More oil, please.  And there's Anthony Edwards with his shirt on.  Hilarious.  Why wouldn't he just sit out the volleyball scene and give it to somebody else?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Man.  Who did the Top Gun bit that we used to play in the old days? 
[03:04:30]  Talking about what?  How gay it is?  Yeah.  Tarantino.  It was Tarantino.  Can we play that clip?  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  It's a hilarious clip.  You can find that he rocked.  You know what this was for?  Because when you take a chick to a movie that's about motorcycles and fighter planes and fucking  shit, they're going to get bored real fast.  Yep.  So you had to have...  Look at him.  Yeah, let me look at my watch.  You had to have some, you know, beefcake for the ladies.  It's true. 
[03:05:00]  Because, you know, movies were date movies back then.  It's kind of like what they're doing with the new James Bond.  You notice in the new James Bond movies, the only people taking their shirts off is  Bond.  Bond.  He's always got a shirt off.  Yes.  It's for your girl.  Like a Val Kilmer.  All ripped.  Yep.  Everyone with more oil.  They use a lot of oil on this.  A lot of oil.  Look at him.  In the sand.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah.  High five.  Low fives.  He's wearing...  Oh, my God.  This is so homoerotic.  He's wearing jeans, though. 
[03:05:30]  You ever try to play volleyball in jeans?  That's a tough one.  That's horrendous.  Don't matter.  Oh, they're spiking each other.  Look at this.  Tube sucks.  That is fucking amazing.  Yeah.  High five.  All right.  E-Rock found it.  Oh, they're touching each other.  E-Rock found it.  You got to hear this, Tom Pop.  How long is it?  It's two minutes.  It's not 17 minutes?  Sure.  Sure.  It's not 17 minutes.  You guys are calling it in. 
[03:06:00]  So, what are we listening to?  Quentin Tarantino talking about this very movie.  Got a great take on it.  Coming out in 3D, so it's relevant.  Yes, it is.  Yes.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is?  What?  Top Gun.  Oh, come on.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  You think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah.  It's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.  It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality. 
[03:06:30]  That's it.  That is what Top Gun is about, man.  You've got Maverick.  All right?  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line.  All right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  And they represent the gay man.  Gay.  All right?  And they're saying, go.  Go the gay way.  Go the gay way.  He could go both ways.  But not Kelly McGillis, right?  Kelly McGillis.  She's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  And they're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way.  All right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie. 
[03:07:00]  What is this?  Goes to her house, right?  All right?  It looks like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything.  They don't have sex.  He gets in the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here?  Right.  Next scene.  Next scene, you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy.  She's got the cap on.  She's got the aviator clashes.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears.  She goes, okay, this is how I got to get this guy.  This guy's going towards the gay way.  So I got to bring him back.  I got to bring him back from the gay way.  So I'm going to do that through subterfuge.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right? 
[03:07:30]  That is how she approaches it.  Right.  All right?  But the real ending of the movie is when they fight the MiGs at the end.  All right?  Because he has passed over into the gay way.  They are this gay fighting fucking force.  All right?  And they're beating the Russians.  The gays are beating the Russians.  All right?  And it's over.  And they fucking land.  And Iceman's been trying to get Maverick the entire time.  Finally, he's got him.  All right?  And what is the last fucking line that they had together at all?  Hugging and kissing and happy with each other.  And Ice comes up to Maverick, and he says,  Man, you can ride my tail in time.  And what does Maverick say? 
[03:08:00]  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  Jesus Christ.  What is that from?  Anyone?  You maniac.  I don't know what it's from.  I forgot what movie it's from.  That's great.  That's a movie?  Really funny.  Swingers?  Swingers?  That was her swingers, huh?  Swingers.  Swingers.  Thank you.  Really?  Who got that one in?  Fishman.  You prick.  Very good.  Logan.  Logan, of course, sleep at the wheel. 
[03:08:30]  Hollywood.  I got to say, Pearl Jam Day, I don't think it really works.  Not feeling it.  No.  Why don't you pick a Pearl Jam song?  Why are you being a hater?  I'm not being a hater.  Why don't you help it out a little bit?  All right.  Let me help it out.  I'm going to say, Coke Logic in Chicago is counting on you right now.  You know that, right?  Who is?  Coke Logic.  Oh, really?  It's all about your choice.  We might hear, fuck all the way from Chicago. 
[03:09:00]  Pick the wrong song.  How would you pick the wrong song?  Yeah, you don't go with the hits.  You don't?  Nope.  You're not going with the hits.  You don't go with Alive.  You don't go with Daughter.  How about Last Kiss?  No.  Oh, boy.  Let me hear Last Kiss.  I don't know.  Tell Pop his choice.  He's going to be at the Stress Factory.  Vinnie Brands.  Vinnie Brands Stress Factory.  Stress Factory.  Starting tonight.  Yeah, we did this, right?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah, you can't pick this one.  Did we do this? 
[03:09:30]  Of course.  Of course.  This is one where you go, oh, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her.  How about Wishlist?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wishlist?  Have you done Wishlist?  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Now we're talking.  For your wife.  Yeah, I like this one.  This is a good one.  The movie was Sleep With Me? 
[03:10:00]  Not Swingers?  Yeah, it was Sleep With Me.  All right, go fuck your mother.  I knew it wasn't Swingers.  All right.  I'm just getting my information off of Shitheads from fucking Peltaux.  I wonder if CokeLogic has given this one a thumbs up.  I hate this fucking song.  This is a good one.  You don't like the sensitive Eddie better.  Anthony ruins every Pearl Jam song.  I don't like shit you can't really sing to.  He finds a problem with every song.  I really do.  That's a good one, right? 
[03:10:30]  Why is it Pearl Jam today when no one likes Pearl Jam here?  I love Pearl Jam.  I hope he named it Pearl Jam.  Hey, he loves Pearl Jam.  I should have had penalties for giving me false information on PalTalk like that.  The guy made me say swingers.  I know.  You should ban him.  Stupid fish man.  Lifetime ban.  You eliminate him?  Huh?  Lifetime ban.  I don't know.  I should probably fucking...  I don't know. 
[03:11:00]  You know what?  I think...  You like this one?  Yeah, I like this.  I like when he slows it down.  Yeah.  You like Just Breathe.  Yeah.  So do I.  What else is going on?  So we did The Corpse in the L.A. Hotel.  Ew.  That's a sick story.  That was the sickest story.  Of the day?  Which was worse, that one or the moms telling the girls to beat each other up? 
[03:11:30]  The moms.  Yeah, it was worse, right?  Yes, it was.  Yeah, I'm bouncing him.  You should do.  Good.  Yeah, eliminate.  That's it.  He'll be back.  Eventually.  He's got to earn it.  I bounce him for the end of the show.  He doesn't get to hear how this fucking whole thing wraps up.  Tom Papa, you're about to be graded.  Live from Chicago.  I knew he was listening.  It's Coke Logic, who is a massive Pearl Jam fan.  Oh, boy.  Coke Logic, sir, it's to you.  Yeah, I didn't like your first choice there, Tom Papa. 
[03:12:00]  A cover song, Last Kiss, is not the first choice I would have gone with.  Oh, boy.  What about Wishlist?  He was calling you an asshole.  I accept it.  I accept it.  Wishlist is pretty good.  It's off of Yield.  It's when Pearl Jam started to get really strong again, when they got the new drummer,  then new drummer, Matt Cameron, I think he's been in this band for like 15 years now.  What about Bugs? 
[03:12:30]  Bugs.  Bugs.  Bugs.  Bugs.  No, I can't fucking be on board with this Pearl Jam thing.  So I think you got a passing grade for Wishlist.  Sounds like it.  Yes.  What's your favorite Pearl Jam song there, Coke Logic?  Probably, I think Travis played it.  I think it's Indifference.  Insignificant.  What?  Insignificant.  I don't think we played that, did we?  Yeah, coming back from the second break, I think. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, okay.  That's a good choice.  When are you going to put out another animation, you lazy fuck?  I just did.  Oh, okay.  Put out the Harlem Shake.  Yeah, he did an animated version of the Harlem Shake.  Oh.  It was pretty funny.  Fuck me running.  It was pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah, put it up on our Facebook page, E-Rock.  I like that Coke Logic guy.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's a talented guy.  He's pretty cool.  Thanks, C.  Yeah.  C-L.  Harlem Shake.  The Harlem Shake.  Did you guys do one here?  Are you guys part of the craze? 
[03:13:30]  Did you do it after the Today Show did it?  If they did one, forget it.  It's over.  It was over when it started.  It was so fast.  Yeah, yeah.  It was not really.  And I guess they were up in Harlem today, the news, interviewing some people about it.  The Harlem Shake?  And some people were offended.  Why would they do that on the internet?  I don't know.  Because it's just people jumping around stupid instead of actually dancing or something.  Oh, give me a minute.  They've got to look for some angle.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, some angry angle.  Sam Roberts did one.  Yeah, I did.  He did?  Yes, I did.  Why haven't I seen it?  Yeah, I should have looked at it.  Was it good?  Where is it?  You want to see it?  What was it?  Did it have something to do with wrestling?  No.  You want to see it?  Yeah, why not?  Have you ever matched your internet craze from that?  No.  No.  Oh, with the iPhone girl is the best.  A one-hit wonder on the internet.  Apple 5.  He's never going to fucking...  Yeah.  That was an 8-6-7-5-3-0-9 for him.  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Here we go.  Sam Roberts doing the Harlem Shake video.  Awesome.  Not Sam on the old YouTube.  That's right.  Five minutes.  So it's Sam on a computer.  Yeah, right.  Board.  Hand on his face.  Of course.  Subtle head bopping.  Subtle head bopping.  Now waiting for the switchover.  Oh, there it comes.  He looks up like, what the fuck's going on?  Confused.  I like the action in this. 
[03:15:00]  And he goes back to being bored on the computer.  Oh, look.  Nothing happened.  See, it's the anti-Harlem Shake video.  Nothing happened.  No one's taking that angle.  Nope.  Wow.  He doesn't want to be bothered by the Harlem Shake.  That was good.  That reminded me of a racer head.  It had the very odd feel to it.  It was weird, right?  Yeah.  22 views.  It's a solid 8,500.  I'm happy with that.  Oh, you can't be after that big fucking iPhone.  Please.  I put that out of my mind.  You can't put that out of your mind. 
[03:15:30]  It's like...  It's the big...  That's your fucking hit.  Sam, we just put the video on the top.  It's the way.  We're guaranteed 10,000 views now.  You know that, right?  Please.  That's nice.  You're welcome.  Not Sam on YouTube.  The basketball fucking video got better.  More hits than that.  That's right.  It should.  You want to see my basketball video?  Yeah.  You do, right?  Yeah.  It's the most amazing basketball shot ever.  Hell yeah.  That thing still fucking tricks me.  Dude, people trick me.  It's hilarious.  I started the thing.  Check this out.  It's fucking great, Anthony.  I can't tell you how many times they tricked me with my own video. 
[03:16:00]  You ready?  Yep.  You sure?  Hit it.  Okay.  Ignore the overexcitement that I showed, please.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I'm coming.  Oh, that's popular.  Man.  Popular.  Popular.  Popular.  What song is that?  I'm head of the class.  Popular.  Here you go.  It's quick.  Not a surf, I think.  Hopey Radio.  He is three-fourths of the way to the other side of the basketball court. 
[03:16:30]  Over his head, one-handed, not looking at the basket.  Thank you.  Why isn't that fun?  Nothing but net.  Why isn't that viral?  What was the sound at the end?  What sound?  I said ignore the sound.  Yeah.  I got a little excited.  That's not something you see every day.  Big moment.  And that was the third try, by the way.  This should be the new Gangnam style.  See the other two basketballs on the court?  Those were the misses.  Third one he hit.  Not bad. 
[03:17:00]  Not bad.  It's not a baby doing it.  You've got to get a baby to do it.  I know.  I saw the baby video.  The baby goes viral.  Look at that.  8.7 million.  I know.  That's much better than I told you.  What's the baby do?  He makes all kinds of trick shots.  It is pretty impressive, actually.  Have we done this here?  A little kid does a trick shot.  Yeah, we have.  Grandma, kids never do what you want in front of the camera.  Except this guy.  Can you make a basket?  Basket.  Titus, make a basket for Grandma.  I don't know.  No, look, switch.  Intentious name. 
[03:17:30]  Titus.  What's his name?  Titus.  Ah, that's what it's...  Guess how he got the name Titus.  Yeah!  Isn't he amazing?  Look at him.  I don't like this kid at all.  No.  He's making a shitload of shots, but Fox and Friends put him on?  Yeah.  They're just dummies over there.  They just assumed the kid made all these shots and there weren't a million fucking misses. 
[03:18:00]  Exactly.  So they put him on with a basket, and now the kid's looking like an asshole because he's  missing every shot.  Why would the parent let his kid on live TV?  Of course.  You got a final video where it makes it look like he's Larry Bird.  Nothing but net.  And then he goes on Fox and Friends and barely made a basket.  YouTube comments now, saw this kid on Fox News, not impressed.  You guys have done the...  Nothing special!  You did that Swedish guy who's the punter, right?  Oh, wow.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Have you seen the punter, Ant? 
[03:18:30]  We didn't talk about it on our show.  Oh, no.  Oh, no?  Amazing.  He's going to try out with the Jets, I think.  Yes.  Really?  You haven't seen this?  No.  As far as trick shots go, there's not a better video out there.  Really?  It's amazing.  He's Swedish, right?  I don't know.  Something like that.  And he wanted to become good at football, so he just started punting with his friends,  started punting his football around, and he got really crazy good at it.  Dude, amazing.  They're bringing him over to the NFL, and they're trying him out.  Put it on our Facebook page if you find it, E-Rock. 
[03:19:00]  We didn't talk about it on the show.  Do you know where it is?  No.  Obviously, Sam can't find a viral video.  You said it.  It's amazing.  It's got, like, millions of hits.  What?  Kicker.  I didn't say anything.  Kicker.  Any other keywords?  I don't know.  Kick football?  Kick football.  This thing went big time viral.  Okay.  It was everywhere.  Kick football.  For a couple months.  Norway.  Norway.  Norway?  I think it's Norway.  Any of these videos?  Try Norway.  Gee. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Norway.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I think it's Kickalicious.  You think so?  Somebody put it up here.  2.4 million.  So it's called Kickalicious.  It's five months ago, though.  They said it's called Kickalicious.  All right.  Let's try it.  All right.  And believe me, they're taking their chances here on Peltog.  Oh, yeah.  This is it.  That's him.  That's him.  Watch this.  I wanted to see him get bounced.  What the fuck?  Did you see that?  Yeah.  It went right into the garbage pill.  He's just like 60 yards.  60 yards.  Wow. 
[03:20:00]  The music is good for the radio audience as we watch this.  Kicks into a roadboat in the middle of the water.  Guy catches it.  Come on.  This guy's crazy.  This guy just throws the ball up in the air and he kicks it.  How could he be this guy?  I don't know.  That's all he does.  Wait till you see some of these other shots.  And then he does crazy angles.  Yeah.  Where he's got to cut the ball. 
[03:20:30]  Look at that.  Come on.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  He used his other foot.  I don't even understand how he's doing this.  Very good.  Look at that.  From almost the side of the goal post.  Are they really giving him a shot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Jets.  60 yard field goals.  He isn't in fucking school.  No.  No football thing.  No.  They're just saying, hey, this guy's good.  Let's grab him.  He doesn't even know the game. 
[03:21:00]  That's fucking great.  He just kicked a 60, 50 in a 40 yard field goal like it's nothing.  And then 30 yards.  All in a row.  Into a moving car.  That's sick.  But there's nothing to do in Norway, huh?  Exactly.  Fucking Norway.  But you could tell he's one of these guys that he didn't have a lot of misses.  No.  He looks that damn good.  They actually had some guys come and check it out to see, did they manipulate the video? 
[03:21:30]  And they showed him all the raw footage.  Right.  And he was crazy accurate.  Now he's just juggling with his feet and then fucking kicks it.  Like a hacky sack.  Yeah.  Like a hacky sack.  Well, funny story about Norway.  I knew as a child they spoke Norwegian, but I thought people that spoke Norwegian were  from Norwegia.  They did.  Honestly did.  Get out.  Adorable.  Get out.  That's adorable.  Get out. 
[03:22:00]  This guy is...  Yeah, look.  It's from the side.  He's hitting it.  He's hitting it with like nothing from the side.  Yeah, that's...  He's on a dune at a beach.  Yeah, what the fuck?  No, he's down below and he kicked it to his friend up top.  Oh, man.  It really is a sick video.  It's...  We don't feel like explaining every kick, obviously.  Yeah, kick-a-licious.  Well, we would have.  It's called kick-a-licious if you haven't seen it yet.  It's pretty well-being.  It's just a New York jet next year, perhaps.  Can anyone do this if you practice long enough?  No. 
[03:22:30]  No.  I don't think so.  It's like a talent, 50 yards.  Yeah.  You need the right kind of foot.  He's kicking like one, two, three, four, five in a row, six in a row.  Yeah.  Amazing.  This guy's fucking amazing.  He's kick-a-licious.  But they don't know if he'll be able to, you know, in a stadium filled with people screaming.  Oh.  Because he's probably only seen 10 people in his life.  What would happen at Jeff's stadium?  They got to put, like, horse blinders on him.  Right.  A visor.  He's never worn a football helmet, so that's probably going to fuck up everything. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, my God.  He can't do anything.  Just that dumb helmet will just mess up everything.  That's a good point.  Right?  He's got to put that helmet on.  Yeah.  All the gear, you know?  He's got to fucking wear it.  Leave it up to the Jets to bring him up.  And then some big bruisers trying to fucking kill you before you get the kickoff.  I feel like this guy, this could be like an Adam Sandler movie.  Yeah.  I've been kicking the ball my whole life.  I'm just trying to kick the ball to the goalpost. 
[03:23:30]  And he can only kick it with his hoodie.  And his uniform is a hoodie.  Yeah.  Because that's the only way he could do it.  And the NFL allows it for whatever dumb reason.  One of his friends on the sidelines, you can do it!  All right.  We've seen this movie.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  That is a good Sandler movie.  Tom Papa?  Yes, fellas.  Yes.  It's always a pleasure.  Always good to see you guys.  Give us some nice energy when you come in here.  Stress Factory is going to be rocking.  We do always find when Tom comes in. 
[03:24:00]  Absolutely.  Vinnie Brandt's Stress Factory is starting tonight.  Highly, highly recommend you see Tom Papa.  Like Jimmy said, man.  What did Jimmy's exact quote?  That, um...  He likes, um, men.  Yeah.  That trusts like women.  He likes massages.  And what?  He likes turning women from legit massage to illegal activity.  And that my 7 o'clock show on Friday needs help.  Aw.  That's stupid.  It should sell out. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, it should sell out.  Oh, and I'll see you guys at the, uh, cocktail party, perhaps.  The soiree that you're having.  Now that we went through our cheeses.  It is a soiree.  I feel like I'm living, uh, during the turn of the last century.  That's right.  If you have a smoking jacket, you should wear it.  Mm.  I think I have one.  I don't even know what it is.  Yeah.  It feels victorious.  What normally happens is the girls sit on one side, and then the men talk business and  smoke on the other side.  Right.  And tell them, you know, this isn't for you.

If you don't know that by now.  Did you put my Harlem Shake video on the Facebook page, E-Rock?  I can do that for you, yes.  Don't get jealous of all the great attention it's getting, okay?  Okay.  Thank you. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, that's up on the Facebook page, I guess, so that way everybody doesn't have to try  to find it.  Because they're clamoring for it now after it was mentioned on the show.  I mean, they're literally...  I'll tell you what I learned today.  Travis may beat the shit out of E-Rock.  He made a sound that nobody picked up on that led me to believe that E-Rock prefers David  Lee Roth to Pearl Jam.  Is that right, E-Rock?  At that moment, I did, yes. 
[03:28:00]  Do you like David Lee Roth better than Pearl Jam?  I'm tired of hearing Pearl Jam.  Oh, you just mean because it gets played a lot on this show?  And everywhere that I go.  How is that?  What do you mean everywhere?  It just, it seems...  In my truck.  No, it just seems like Pearl Jam...  I don't know.  It's not like Pearl Jam ever went away, but I've been hearing it more and more places  that I go.  Well, they've passed the sort of...  I mean, they're one of the few bands of that era that are not retro when you hear them.  You know what I mean?  It's just like, yeah, it's Pearl Jam.  Like, they're actually still cool. 
[03:28:30]  And so I get...  And there aren't really any rock bands left that are cool.  You don't like...  But you like David Lee Roth.  You're a fan.  At that moment, yes.  I was happy to hear David Lee Roth.  What do you think, Roland?  I love Pearl Jam.  You do?  Yeah.  You're a big Pearl Jam fan?  I mean, I've seen him before.  Yeah, he's really...  I mean, he's amazing.  Eddie Vedder, you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The group is amazing too.  I mean, you see a live show, you go, wow, that's a show.  Well, and you are a guy who appreciates a good live show because Bruce Springsteen made 
[03:29:00]  his bones off that, didn't he?  Yeah.  Him, they saw like...  Even from him to even Blake Shelton, they go, enjoy the show.  You always try to mention Blake Shelton on this show.  Whenever you get a chance.  That's his honeybee.  Nobody's talking about Blake Shelton live shows.  I am.  Who cares about Blake Shelton?  It's good.  Is he still on The Voice or did he get kicked off?  Still on The Voice.  Who got...  What's the deal with The Voice?  It's Adam, Blake, and then it's Usher and Shakira.  Okay, so it's Adam Levine from Maroon 5, Blake Shelton, and then Usher and Shakira? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Why did they kick off CeeLo and Christina Aguilera?  They're touring or something.  They're touring and they're doing albums.  That's a dumb move.  And like Blake Shelton's album comes out today and he's still...  He'll be able to promote it.  Because Blake Shelton understands that that's where his bread is buttered.  Yeah.  Like nobody's talking about Blake Shelton if he's not on The View.  Like in Maroon 5, they sold out The Garden last weekend.  Of course.  I mean, Adam Levine is a big star.  Yeah, but before they were playing like, was it Rosalind?  Rosalind and stuff like that.  So, Christina Aguilera is going to go work on an album and tour instead of doing The Voice? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Does she not realize she's finished?  She's over?  Well, they said they think they can get back.  Like, oh, I'll come back next season.  But, they said there's no guarantees.  Why would you give up your seat?  It's crazy to me when people do stuff like that.  They'll bring Adam back.  Adam, he's on every magazine.  He's there.  No, Adam still.  He's there still.  Yeah, Adam said, Adam and Blake said you have to peel them off their seats, which are smart.  That's the way you're supposed to do it.  Yeah.  I don't like ever getting off this seat.  It's a Sam Roberts attitude. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  You can't let your seat go.  Because guess what?  If this season America falls in love with Usher, nobody's going to be missing CeeLo Green.  They'll be like, oh, no, the new black guy who's in shape.  That's the one I like.  Or my favorite, they ask Blake, how are you going to do the voice and tour?  He goes, well, I go around.  The dates.  That's it.  How about because the only reason people buy tickets is because I'm on the voice.  So I just make it work.  He's hilarious on Twitter.  Roland's not going to like this, but my mom's a huge country fan.  And she said Blake got really popular because of this show. 
[03:31:00]  Of course.  That's what we're saying.  He was really kind of dead in the water up until he got this.  Well, he was like, he had his core fans, but now it's just a lot more people go see him  to see the voice guy.  He's a crossover.  Yeah.  I mean, he's got, NBC does Christmas specials with him.  That's not happening without the voice.  No.  And he knows it.  He's smart.  Yeah.  And that's why he kept a lot, and he brought his wife into the special too because she  has a band.  And I hate to tell her this.  I hate to be the one to break the news to Christina Aguilera.  But once people realize that they can look at Shakira on their television sets instead 
[03:31:30]  of big, fat, used-to-be-hot Christina Aguilera, why is anybody going to want her back?  Shakira can't even speak English, and it doesn't matter.  And Usher's an amazing performer.  He'll jump up, dance, and...  He will.  He'll do a little dance, right?  Yeah.  He does look like a little midget.  And then the minute that people start to lose faith in Usher, he'll be like, you know  Justin Bieber?  All me, baby.  And they'll be like, yay!  Oh, yeah.  Or he'll do some incredible performance with Bieber and all these people, and people are like, yay!  I mean, CeeLo Green, maybe, because at least he's still kind of making music. 
[03:32:00]  Like, he's, you know what I mean?  He's still an active performer.  But why?  So did Christina Aguilera leave, and then they replaced her with Shakira?  She told them that she wasn't going to go back that season because she wanted to do music  and tour.  So she had to look down.  When she finds out that Shakira is going to replace her, like, oh, what the fuck did I  just do?  Yeah, because she's international.  She probably thought that they were going to replace her with, like, Paula Abdul or something  like that.  Yeah, or one of the Wilson sisters.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:32:30]  Carnie Wilson just shows up.  Exactly.  But instead, no, because there's no way.  She's hot.  Of course she's hot.  She had her kid already, right?  Shakira?  Yeah, but the commercial, she looks so fucking hot.  She snapped back into shape, right?  Beyond.  Because she knows Christina Aguilera is a big, fat monster, and people are not going  to sit there and be like, oh, let me turn on NBC.  Oh, where's the big fatso?  I miss her.  Yeah, and Shakira has international appeal, so they're going to go, oh, we'll keep her.  International appeal.  You know a little something about that, don't you, Roland? 
[03:33:00]  What is that?  616, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, you guys are talking about Blake Shelton.  How come we don't have a phone screener, Eric?  What's that?  I'm dealing with that right now.  They're doing a million other things.  Like what?  Listen, Blake Shelton is like on top of the food chain in country music.  He's married to Miranda Lambert.  Those guys are like worth $100 million a year, so that's my contribution.  Yeah.  I listen to the show all the time, but you guys are acting like, oh, he's not like really  anybody who's anything. 
[03:33:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He is somebody.  You see him in Entertainer of the Year.  But he wouldn't be as...  A household name.  He wouldn't be a household name without the voice.  That's exactly right.  He wouldn't be.  He would be selling big for country crowds.  He would do well in Nashville, but he can sell tickets in New York now because of the  voice.  He played Rosalind on Monday.  He did?  Yeah.  He sell a place out?  Yeah.  Easily, right?  It was him and Lady A, Antebellum.  Is that what they call them?  Lady A?  Yeah.  Lady Antebellum.  I love them.  They had one crossover hit, right?  It's a quarter after, man? 
[03:34:00]  I think they have two, too.  They're good.  8-4-5.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  I was wondering, do you think the little guy there from the voice could still wipe his  ass?  That fucking black guy?  He got nervous, I think.  A bidet.  Yeah.  See, little green could just use a bidet, right?  Guy got nervous.  Let me go to 3-3-6.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  I was going to give this to Opie and Anthony, but apparently they didn't deem it worthy 
[03:34:30]  enough.  Right.  Well, Sal wasn't doing his job.  Well, Sal, nobody's doing their job now.  I'm picking up phones blind, so maybe you shouldn't be on the phone at all, but go ahead.  Two, do you know what the words to the Harlem Shake mean?  It's something about terrorists, right?  That's what people say.  It's...  We are with the terrorists.  I swear to God, it's Spanish.  Well, you know what?  What happened?  Did you see my Harlem Shake video?  Not yet.  I will guarantee you.  Look it up.  My YouTube username is not Sam. 
[03:35:00]  It is the least enthusiastic Harlem Shake video ever created.  And you know what that makes me?  A patriot.  A patriot.  Oh.  Because those lyrics say, oh, the terrorists are great, and I'm going like this.  I'm not enthusiastic about this song right now.  A great American.  Yeah.  Thank you, Pindejo.  All right, buddy.  It makes me a great American, Roland.  Yes.  Because I'm sitting there going, everybody's dancing about this song.  Not Sam Roberts. 
[03:35:30]  Not primetime.  Not broadcasting profession.  Jon Stewart did.  Jon Stewart did, because he would prefer the terrorists win.  That's what I've heard.  He would prefer the terrorists win this one.  Not me.  Catchy song or not.  It's the same thing with...  Is that the new thing now?  Any time there's like a catchy song that's international, we accuse them of hating America.  It's the same thing that happened to Psy.  Yeah.  It's like, don't you know that he said America was terrible?  Don't you know what Harlem Shuffle means?  M.I.A. too.  And M.I.A.  What was happening with the interns, Eric? 
[03:36:00]  One of them was burning something for Troy.  He said, as soon as you're done, bring that back over...  Come back over here.  And the other one was taking stuff from the studio to the office.  Tell him you could burn shit anytime.  There's a live show going on.  Troy needed it.  Troy can suck my dick.  He might.  Yeah, I know.  Troy...  Be careful.  Be careful.  Troy can't suck my dick, I meant.  Cannot.  Metaphorically.  Metaphorically speaking.  Thank you for saving me.  He's doing it now.  Roland.  Mark in Texas. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I'm going to have to disagree with you about Christina Aguilera.  I'm not a real big fan of hers, but...  I mean, who the hell do you think you are criticizing or calling her fat and this and that?  You're a nobody.  Dude.  Dude, the question is, are you going to sit down on your television set and watch Christina  Aguilera or Shakira?  Shakira every time.  The only comparison would be like, oh, Sam, somebody wants to come in and host the after  show for a week.  I would never say okay, because chances are if they're breathing, they do a better job 
[03:37:00]  than me.  So I would never allow it to happen.  It did happen once.  And then when...  Anybody can go for it.  Christina Aguilera.  I just made...  Mark, I just made a self-deprecating joke that had the same punchline as you.  Well, I just called it to know that your show stinks.  What are you listening to right now?  Hmm?  I'm listening to you because there's really nothing else on there.  Okay.  Well, hopefully you can find something on the 200 channels on the platform. 
[03:37:30]  Damn asshole.  It didn't work, did it, Roland?  No.  When I gave up...  You're a bitch.  No, when I gave up the seat.  No, it didn't work.  And Roland took over.  No.  Well, then everybody else took over.  It was like, oof.  That's what happens.  It's not easy.  That's what happens.  I was...  I'm glad you're in here, Roland.  Because right here, the VJs are promoting their book soon.  Oh, the V...  Well...  It scares me.  I think Opie and Anthony...  So the original MTV VJs are promoting a book?  Yeah, it's all about from the first VJs until now, like, how it evolved. 
[03:38:00]  I think Opie and Anthony should take them.  Number one, because...  I mean, all we do is talk about 80s music anyway, so it would make sense to have the VJs on.  And number two, because I would like their reaction to the first time that they walked into this studio.  When Roland was the guest host for After Opie and Anthony Live, he had all five...  Well, one of them's dead, right, Eric?  Yeah, one of them's dead.  Chubby Checker, whatever his name was?  Yeah.  Yeah, that dude right there.  The black guy, for lack of... 
[03:38:30]  Right.  He's dead.  All the other ones showed up, and they were in here.  And Nina, Mark, Alan, and Martha.  Right.  All of them...  One of them had a video camera.  That's Alan.  Alan had his video camera out, like, here we go.  He was very excited.  And I was in here helping Roland along before they got here, but all these DJs, VJs walk in.  And so I snuck out while they were coming in.  So it was just Roland in here alone to interview the original MTV VJs.  And his first...  First, they all sit down, and they go, hey, how's it going? 
[03:39:00]  And Roland goes, I don't want to be here.  And Mark Goodman looks at him, and he goes, you don't want to be here?  Roland goes, no, because it's another host.  And then he looks around the room, and they're just staring at him.  And he goes, talk amongst yourselves.  And they're like, what interview starts with talk amongst yourselves?  And Roland just had to sit there and just wait for them to leave one by one. 
[03:39:30]  And then Mark was the first one that slammed the door hard.  He just walked out.  He was like, boom.  The door, and I went, well, that's one.  And then Alan put away his camera very slowly, going, what the fuck?  But that's why we've got to have him back on.  I would love for them to go on O&A, be on the big show.  Replay it?  And then replay it, and they could all be like, fuck that guy, Roland.  Yeah.  And they humiliate him.  Because they thought this was like a big trick on them.  Like they were being punked.  Yeah, because they said somebody ran down and got me from the lobby. 
[03:40:00]  They said to come in here, what the fuck is going on?  Because first.  They're very angry.  First somebody told them, well, Opie and Anthony want to talk to you.  Yeah.  And then we had to break the news.  Not Opie and Anthony.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, 2 o'clock.  Still a great show.  But what they didn't realize was Sam won't be hosting today.  It's Roland.  Not even the B team.  Yeah, yeah.  Not even the B team.  I mean, Roland's going to be hosting.  Like you said, not only is he not the B team of hosts.  No.  He's this guy on the side that we don't understand what he's saying 
[03:40:30]  when there is the host there.  Correct.  Let's go to Andrew in Jersey.  What's up, Andrew?  How you doing?  Hey, I just want to say that guy was a fucking asshole  with the dumb self-deprecating joke.  And I got to say, when your first show, your show first came on,  I was a little avid.  But I got to say, you really grew on me.  And I think you're going to take the reins of ONA  and do a better job than them.  Well, thank you for saying that.  I don't know if I'll ever do a better job than Opie and Anthony,  but I'm killing it now, son. 
[03:41:00]  Still killing it.  And you know what?  If I do slightly worse than Opie and Anthony on their best day,  it's still pretty damn good, isn't it, Roland?  Better than the summer shows, I'll tell you what.  That's right.  It sounded like he said better than the summer shows,  but what he said was better than some shows, I believe.  That's correct.  Okay.  Ivan in California.  Oh, I want to disagree with that dumb redneck fucking sister fucker  saying that Latin and everybody hates the U.S.  about terrorists and all that. 
[03:41:30]  Any Hispanic or Latin, as I am one of them,  we love the fucking U.S.  Why do you think we can't stay out of here?  That's right.  You go around and fuck that guy.  Now, I've got to ask you, Ivan.  You're a man of Latin descent.  Are you going to sit down?  If you're watching The Voice,  are you ever going to accept having Christina Aguilera  back on your TV after Shakira's been in front of you?  You know, Shakira's got that ass, and she can shake it.  That's what I'm saying.  It's that ass.  Hips don't lie, Ivan. 
[03:42:00]  Nope.  No, they don't.  Thank you.  Mongo.  Let's go to Mongo the Trucker.  Oh, my God.  I'm so excited.  Am I talking to the singer at Sam Roberts?  Yes, Mongo.  You've done it so many times before.  Oh, sorry.  I was to the 80s channel quite a bit,  and, you know, a couple of them are all right.  Nina sounds like, you know, an old man,  and I don't understand why they feel the need  to still hit the post on the music.  I mean, they have a song like Madness, Our House,  which has a great beginning, 
[03:42:30]  and they're talking and rambling some inane bullshit  over the front of it trying to hit the post.  It's not terrestrial radio.  So you're just sitting there,  just say what you've got to say,  and then play the song.  Exactly.  You'd think I'm...  They probably do that for Take On Me,  because that's a long intro.  They're like, yes, I get to say something.  Tom Pop is back.  Hello.  He's not saying anything, though.  I'm scared.  Hi, guys.  Hello.  Hello.  What brings you back in? 
[03:43:00]  I couldn't find my way out of the building.  Is that right?  I have a pass.  They gave me a new pass  so I can get in the building,  but I can't...  Can't leave.  ...work to get out.  Yeah.  No.  So, um...  So you're stuck here?  Yeah, I don't...  I think I am.  What else are you doing here today?  Um, nothing.  So you...  Why would you come back later, then?  What do you mean, come back?  Didn't you just say you got a pass  so you could come back later?  No, I have a pass  to get in the building  to do my show and stuff like that.  Oh, I got you. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  But they won't let you leave.  But I can't get out of here.  Oh.  So this is what happens  on the second shift?  Well, I mean, you know,  you came kind of stumbling in weary  and I was like,  what's going on?  I don't know what's happening.  Tom Papa looks like  he's been through something  since the last time we saw him.  Yeah, it's weird here  when you...  when you can't get out  of the building.  Yeah.  It's, um...  It seems...  There's not a lot of people  here in the building.  No.  You think...  Because, like, yeah, 
[03:44:00]  when you're doing...  When you're doing O&A,  it's like...  There's Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  Right.  And there's all of us,  like, running around.  All the activity, bustle.  Yeah.  You guys leave  and then it's just...  There's nothing else going on.  No.  Nothing.  It's like everybody's just  trading off...  Half the studios  are literally the size  of a closet.  Nothing's live.  No.  And then this is on  the Opie and Anthony channel  and you're like,  what?  Right.  What happened?  So go ahead.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I didn't want to, uh...  No, I mean,  it's never an interruption. 
[03:44:30]  It's an inclusion.  That's what it is.  Did you see the big shooting  in Las Vegas?  Yeah.  Where Jimmy's going?  What happened in Vegas?  There was a shootout  on the Strip.  Oh, is that with the cars?  Yeah, there was a  car-to-car shooting.  It was like the Wild West  and then, uh...  GTA.  Is that what it was?  Have you...  Did you see, uh...  End of Watch?  The Jake Gyllenhaal cop movie?  No, no, yeah.  No.  I don't know.  It was good.  It was good,  but I felt like  there was a lot of shooting.  I don't feel like  that could possibly  actually happen.  Like, I know they say, 
[03:45:00]  like, in gang areas  we don't hear about  all the shooting  that happens.  But, I mean,  there was a lot,  like, mass shootings.  You'd think that somebody  would have reported  on something like that.  Because I guess...  It's a movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's like a gritty movie.  So it's like,  oh, this is real.  Oh.  Like, half the movie  is filmed, like,  point of view.  Like, Jake Gyllenhaal  has his own cameras.  His character has cameras.  Right.  So it's supposed to be,  like, real life.  Oh.  So you got fooled  into thinking  it wasn't a movie. 
[03:45:30]  I was like,  oh, it's like cops.  But then they're like,  the Mexican cartel  has taken over.  They want to kill  Jake Gyllenhaal.  And I was like,  what?  And you're watching  the movie  and checking up  the reports  on CNN on your phone.  Yeah.  Like, why isn't  anyone reporting this?  I know it's a movie,  but that means  it was filmed.  It was real at some time,  right?  Like, a year ago.  No.  No.  So this is cool.  I like...  It's a lot cleaner  in here during this show.  Newspapers.  There's nothing to report.  We have the intern...  No, yeah.  We have the intern scurry in  because technically 
[03:46:00]  I shouldn't be doing  any real material  on the show, right?  Because the material  that I get  I should be giving  to Opie and Anthony.  Right.  So then, you know,  we go to the calls  and we see who stumbles in  and...  Right.  And that's it.  That's the whole show.  It's pretty good.  And how long  do you do this for?  An hour.  An hour?  And it usually works out  pretty well.  That's not bad.  An hour.  You can burn an hour  pretty quick.  Yeah.  Especially, you know,  and something's going on  behind the scenes.  Eric will do something stupid.  An intern comes in  and acts like an asshole.  Right.  And that's it.  I mean, when an intern 
[03:46:30]  acts like an asshole  around here,  I'm in paradise.  Do you get paid extra  to do this show?  No.  No, he doesn't.  It's part of the overall package  that Sam Roberts  brings to SiriusXM.  Dick in the ass.  Yes.  He does five shows  and then Dick's in the ass.  That's the package  I guess I was thinking about.  The one that gets  shoved in my asshole.  The shows are bringing ratings.  What do I get?  Dick in the ass.  Dick in the ass.  That is the funny thing  about this.  You'll be like,  you'll be working  with a sound guy  and then the next week  he's hosting a show. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And Raw Dog  and I guess that's how it works.  Yeah, that's what happens  because every sound guy here  wants to be doing a show.  Right.  But they don't like,  like the real shows,  they only give to people  who are already  doing something else.  Like who have  established something.  Like they'll give you a show  because you have  an established audience.  Opie and Anthony,  they already made  their name in radio.  Right.  But they're not like  hugely interested  in making new names  in radio.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  Because they're like,  well no,  we'll get the audiences 
[03:47:30]  that already exist.  Why build a new one?  This is good.  Are you getting  a lot of girls this way?  Are you getting more action?  I'm married,  so I don't have to worry about it.  Oh.  But...  Why is he winking like that?  I don't know.  Because if I was getting  action from this show,  it'd just be dudes.  It'd be gay men.  There's no girls.  Do people ever say,  hey, I like you on that show?  Men or women?  Either.  Human beings do.  Yeah, sure.  Human beings.  I was just taking calls  from people that were like,  oh, you're the man.  Well, that's good.  I got a lot of  very affectionate callers. 
[03:48:00]  That's good.  I've come a long way since...  Isn't that better than money?  No.  It's worse.  I would say it's worse.  We have like the obese people.  Obese.  Yeah.  We pretty much cover that.  But I've come a long way  since when you were on the phone  and it was just weird.  Yeah, when I called in  from L.A.  Because first of all,  I knew you didn't know  it was my show.  You thought it was  Opie and Anthony.  Exactly.  So then I was like,  oh, and Roller was like,  no, you got to take...  And I was like,  he's not going to know  it's me  and I'm going to be uncomfortable 
[03:48:30]  and he's not going to know  what's going on.  I was going to learn that phone call  because it just dawned on me  like five minutes in  and I was like,  wait a minute.  Oh, the time change.  Oh.  Yeah.  I shouldn't have done it.  Who show am I on?  I shouldn't have done this.  I show him that stuff  in management  and then they try to cover it up.  He's going to think...  I like how you call yourself  management when we're  in the same room together.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't you?  No, it was McDermott.  I name names.  I name names.  McDermott.  That's pretty ballsy.  Well, it's not ballsy  because nobody on the show  knows who Rollins is talking about.  Exactly.  And John doesn't listen 
[03:49:00]  to the show either.  No, he doesn't listen  to this show.  I mean, who does?  Rollins does.  He comes on here.  He names names.  He starts naming people  that work here  that nobody's heard of.  Right.  So the audience has no idea.  So usually if Rollins is in here,  half the show is either  me explaining who people are  or me reiterating  what Rollins just said  so somebody understands him.  It's very inside.  It should be called  the Inside Show.  Yeah.  Because I can't tell you  how many times Anthony...  That's a better name actually.  Inside Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, but there's 
[03:49:30]  so many connotations.  Exactly.  Oh, it's double entendre.  Yeah, you see how you do that?  Anthony has come in here  cursing in the mornings  because he'll listen  to the show  and he'll have no idea  what Rollins has said.  Like, Rollins will be  going on about something  and he won't have a clue.  All right, I've got to want...  I'm going to try  and get out of the building.  If you...  Yeah, it really is  just a right turn.  All right, I'm going to do my best.  She's here too.  Oh, good.  Who's here?  Bonnie McFarlane.  Oh, okay.  Are you going to interview her 
[03:50:00]  for your show?  I'm going to go hang out with her.  It's very exciting.  No, whenever Rich is out of town,  Bonnie and I hang.  Oh, that's...  Cool.  I mean, that's...  I guess you guys just...  Comedians hang in or whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to plug my show  one more time.  Plug it.  I'm at the Stress Factory.  Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory.  Do you have to say  Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory?  I think contractually  you have to put  Vinnie's name in it now.  And you have to get up on stage  and be like,  so happy to be here  at Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  You have to say the whole thing.  Does he open?  A lot of times.  So will he be opening for you  and then you'll have to  reiterate his name  so you remind everybody  that it's his club?  That wasn't just the host.  That was also  the Vinnie Brand  of Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory  in New Brunswick.  And you're pointing to his name  at the sign, him.  I'm bringing Marina Franklin with me.  Oh.  So hopefully Vinnie  won't have to get up there.  Yeah, she was just at the...  I kid.  Vinnie's very funny.  She was at the Patrice Benefit, Marina. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  She was very, very funny.  Yeah, really well.  Everybody did.  It was really funny.  Yeah, that's good.  She did great.  I wish I had been in town.  But I will be at the Stress Factory.  I'm going to go there tonight.  Friday and Saturday.  So tonight, Friday, and Saturday.  Stress Factory.  What's the website?  Stressfactory.com?  I guess so.  Could you Google it real quick, Will?  Oh, man.  Imagine if they had to change  the website to Vinnie Brand's  Stressfactory.com.  Vinnie...  Vinnie Brand, I'm really the owner  of the Stress Factory  in New Brunswick.com. 
[03:51:30]  He'd know how bad business it was  because nobody would remember,  but he'd insist.  No!  Yeah.  My name has to be in the URL.  You can go to TomPapa.com  and get tickets that way.  That's where you should go.  And you're on Twitter, TomPapa,  at...  At TomPapa.  At...  Good seeing you guys.  It's going to be tough for you.  I would imagine...  Yeah.  ...that you're going to have  a tough time getting through  this set, though,  because you're going to be  focusing on the soiree.  Your cocktail party,  which you mentioned a few times  on the show.  Yeah, that's good.  I really have... 
[03:52:00]  I'm more worried about  what cheese is to get  for the party  than how many bags  of tater tots.  I always have a hard time  figuring out the amount  of people to the amount  of stuff you need.  Right.  Especially with something  small, like tater tots.  Yes.  And it's also like...  How many tots per person?  People can finish off  a basket of ten.  A basket of ten?  Wait, wait, wait.  People can finish off a...  Or can Roland finish  off a basket of ten?  Well, they're drinking  eight to ten.  Okay.  That's safe.  Yeah.  Per person.  The drinking really ups  the eating.  It does. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  You'd be like,  I'm not going to be good  tonight.  I'm not going to eat  anything.  And then one martini  is just stuffing stuff  in your face.  Or what would be good,  too, is if you have  grilled cheeses  with a panini maker.  Oh.  So you get Gouda,  a nice, probably,  I would say,  blue cheese  to kind of balance it out  and bake it.  Make your own paninis.  Oh, my God.  See, this is the class  that Roland brings.  When he said grilled cheese,  I'm sitting there going  like a Kraft single  on two slices of bread.  What kind of party is this?  Picturing myself 
[03:53:00]  at the skillet all night.  Yeah, just flipping.  Flipping.  No, you go to Amy's breads,  they do cuss the breads  for the fancy grilled cheese.  Really?  And it's fucking amazing.  Really?  Yeah.  You should have Roland  come over your house  like the afternoon of.  Yeah.  Just fix everything up.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  Yeah, feed me food,  I'll do it.  All right.  Feed me food.  Good seeing you guys.  All right, man.  I'll do it with the rest  of the 20 minutes.  Is that how long we have?  20 minutes.  Yeah, you can do it.  I think I can get it done.  It's actually only like 15  with commercials, so. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, you get commercials.  Stress Factory this weekend,  Tom Papa.  You got it.  I tried to look it up,  but the computer doesn't work.  What does it say?  The following pages  have become unresponsive.  Well, TomPapa.com.  Check them out  at the Stress Factory.  Brad in Mississippi hung up  as I was picking him up.  One of the all-time regrets  of his life.  Your razor.  Roland, you shave every day.  Eric, you've started shaving again.  Yeah.  You know your razor  doesn't need a vibrating handle, right?  Yeah, they charge too much.  Yeah, it doesn't need  a back scratcher on it.  It doesn't need 10 blades. 
[03:54:00]  All this extra bullshit  is nonsense.  Seriously,  have you noticed  the price that you pay  for new razor blades?  Eric, you're a very,  very wealthy man.  You still have to notice  how much money  you spend on razors.  They're in the 20s.  Yeah.  Is that in pesos?  No, in dollars.  And you're doing that  every month  for the rest of your life.

The one thing  and maybe I made fun  of Christina Aguilera  a little bit  but remember when I used  to make fun  of Guy Fieri a lot? 
[03:55:30]  Yep.  That hurt you, right Roland?  A little bit.  It did  because you love Guy Fieri.  You love food.  You love Food Network.  That's all I watch.  And then all things  combined, Guy Fieri.  Well, I've forgiven him.  We've made up.  We're on good terms again.  You saw, we went to  Guy's restaurant  in Times Square  with Opie.  Yeah.  And Guy said  wonderful things  about me to my face.  Yeah.  And I said  wonderful things  about him.  And he said  you're hilarious  and a great ball buster.  But ever since  I've made up  with Guy Fieri 
[03:56:00]  the internet  has completely  taken over  from what I've  left behind.  Gawker.  I mean they've  destroyed him.  First, it was  this New York Times  review.  Peter Wells.  Which, Peter Wells?  Oh, yeah.  Is that his name?  Yeah.  Peter Weller?  Robocop?  No, this is just  a dick version.  Peter Wells.  He writes this article  and destroys him.  The article goes viral.  Yeah.  Then every time  Guy Fieri comes out  with something  it becomes like  it's all over Reddit.  Like he's got 
[03:56:30]  I don't know  some kind of  frozen pizza thing.  Whatever it was.  It was all over Reddit.  Now,  and I'm surprised  Opie and Anthony  didn't touch on this.  It came out yesterday.  Somebody,  I don't know.  The menu is...  Somebody has to get  in that camp  has to get their heads together.  Because Guy Fieri  did not buy the domain  for,  what's the name  of his restaurant?  Um, the  Guy Fieri's  Bar and Grill.  Bar,  Kitchen and Grill?  Kitchen and Grill, yeah.  Okay.  Guy Fieri did not  buy the domain name 
[03:57:00]  for Guy Fieri's  American Kitchen and Grill.  Whatever the full name is,  he didn't buy the domain name  for his restaurant.  It's guysamericankitchenandbar.com.  That's what he didn't license.  And that's the name  of his place.  Guy's American Kitchen and Bar.  All you have to do  is go to GoDaddy  and just register it.  Yeah.  It's so easy.  I mean,  people have learned  mistakes before.  For a long time,  ericnagel.com  forwarded to  fattyrock.com.  Why was that, Eric?  Did you give it back to him? 
[03:57:30]  Because you did that?  I gave...  I sold it back to him  for a profit.  How much?  It was in the thousands.  But he's got it.  He's got it.  He was squatting on it  is what he was doing.  Eric saved a whole bunch  of money on Dollar Shave Club,  so it was no problem.  He had the money.  But,  Eric,  what was it like  when you found out  that you did not  have the right...  Did it feel invasive  when you found out  you didn't have the rights  to ericnagel.com?  No,  because I didn't think about...  This was five years ago,  maybe?  Sure.  Six years ago, 
[03:58:00]  somewhere in there.  Me and Mark Cuban  were on top of the dot-com boom  five years ago.  I didn't even think about it  until somebody told me  that worked here  that,  hey,  have you checked out  your ericnagel.com?  And I said,  no.  You might want to  check that out.  And what happened?  And then it was linked  to awful things.  Faterock.com?  Yeah.  You didn't want to plug it?  Mm-mm.  But I did,  didn't I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But once you realized  that your domain was taken  and it was forwarding  to something  that humiliated you, 
[03:58:30]  at that point,  did it feel like an invasion?  I thought it was shitty,  but what was I going to do?  So fuck it.  Well,  imagine,  if you're not Eric Nagle,  you're Guy Fieri.  Millions.  That's worse.  Money,  exposure,  the internet hates you  for whatever reason.  I don't know,  yeah.  He's such a nice guy.  And they find out,  so,  Roland,  can you pull it up?  Guys.  I'm looking at it right here.  What is it?  Guys American?  Guys American Kitchen  and Bar dot com. 
[03:59:00]  Okay,  pull it up,  Roland.  Guys American Kitchen  and Bar dot com.  It's the name of his restaurant  in Times Square.  He didn't buy the domain name.  Fortunately for him,  somebody else did.  And what they did was  they went on the website  and they published,  they made up a fake menu  that looks exactly like his.  Eric,  what's your favorite item on the menu?  See,  no,  not that link,  Roland.  Guy owns Guy's American.  He bought Guy's American dot com. 
[03:59:30]  But whoever is in charge of this for him  didn't think to buy Guy's American Kitchen Grill,  blah,  blah,  blah,  the full name of the restaurant.  What's your favorite item on the menu, Eric?  I'm reading the whole thing now.  Yeah,  give me the one at the bottom  just for the side salad.  Okay,  what's the side salad description?  Because you might go to Guy's  and want to order a side salad.  Well,  the side salad is called  The Olive Garden.  It's $16  and it says  22 pounds of wine-stunned Kalamata olives 
[04:00:00]  tumbled over chopped iceberg lettuce  and served in a trough family style.  Trough.  Ranch hose optional,  but recommended.  Ranch hose?  Yeah.  Like as in  I will hose down your salad  with ranch dress ass.  Oh my god.  And he's going to pretend  this doesn't affect him.  We've got to get him on the phone tomorrow.  This one's bad.  Gimme.  Honky tonky double barrel meat loaded blast.  Okay,  by the way,  that item  sounds like something  that would be on his menu.  Yeah.  And this menu pops up  as  The balls is cold. 
[04:00:30]  That menu pops up  as soon as you go to this website  that somebody took his URL  and just posted this menu.  What is that item?  The honky tonky double barrel meat loaded blast.  A Sammy Hagar lookalike  pushes your face  into a leather bag filled with oil  and if you eat the whole thing  you get to eat  a 13 pound burger.  It's a leather bag filled with oil.  And he's going to go around  and he's going to pretend  that this doesn't bother him. 
[04:01:00]  He's going to be like  yeah, you know,  haters are going to hate  people are going to do  what they're going to do  but you know what  I'm going to try to get past it.  Yeah!  And just go forward.  What were you saying?  Do you want him on the show?  I could see if you get him  on the phone tomorrow  for the  doing your show.  If Obi and Anthony  don't want him  I'd love to have him  on this show.  I probably get answers.  Yeah, I mean  see if Obi and A want him  or we'll do him on here  because I would really love  to know  like how do you  when did the internet  start hating him? 
[04:01:30]  Was it the moment  that I forgave him?  Did the internet  sit there and go  you know what  Sam Roberts said  that Guy Fieri was okay.  He's not off the hook.  Did it have anything  to do with Bourdain  speaking out against him?  Bourdain's been  speaking out against him  forever.  Look at this one.  Jesus.  What is it?  Deep.  Okay, that's  Panamania.  Deep fried snake  with a printed picture  of David Lee Roth  stapled on it  and a sparkler  sticking out of each eye 
[04:02:00]  served with a side  of Bud Light  so you have to  served with a side  of Bud Light  you have to ring  out of a Hawaiian shirt.  Oh Guy Fieri  why would you put that  on your menu?  It says that's his spot.  I mean the menu  is not going to lie.  Oh Guy.  What are the fries?  Are they  natural  I think those are  his real fries.  Not Doritos.  Oh no.  Is that Don Kimole? 
[04:02:30]  The spices that you  can get  on his fries  are Thousand Island  Don Kimole  or Doritos.  Did you see  under entries  football  the meal.  Wait, wait, wait.  Under what?  Entries.  Entrees.  Whatever.  Entries?  Pepper Hicks  you're not a cultured  man are you?  I keep it simple Sam.  You do  but you understand  see that  what's that word  with the E right there?  Entries.  No, it's entrees.  You're always  taking Nagel's side 
[04:03:00]  Pepper.  It is under entrees  there.  Football the meal.  Pepper walked in here  yesterday and goes  man, I can't wait  for that punk rock  match at Wrestlemania.  He's always on  E-Rock's side.  What were you going  to say?  What's your favorite  entry?  It says  Football the meal.  Warm broken hamburger  served in a clear  plastic bag  enclosed in a larger  black trash bag  thrown at you  from 40 yards.  Jesus Christ.  Register your domains.  Register your domain  names.  Especially if you have  bleach blonde spiked hair 
[04:03:30]  and you wear jewelry  all the time.  Read the bottom  right here.  What?  Oh, yeah.  The tagline for  Guy's Restaurant  apparently is  if you can eat here  you're a shark.  Man, people are  just assholes.  Oh, he kind of  deserves it.  I don't think so.  I love Guy.  Yeah, but if you're  going to walk around  and be like, you know.  7,462 people  are tweeting that.  Oh, my God.  That's like  retweets or anything.  And the website is  guysamericankitchenandbar.com 
[04:04:00]  and it's not, I mean,  what can he do?  He can't be like,  hey, take that down  because I'll be like,  fuck you.  There's nothing he can do.  And if he tries to  pursue legal action,  there'll just be more  people that are  calling him a douchebag.  I think he just  comes out and says,  fuck you guys.  I don't give a fuck.  He can't, though,  because he wants  middle America  to keep watching him  go to diners  on the Food Network  every week.  It's like if you're  Ryan Seacrest.  I mean, you have  the side, like the  human side, but you  just can't let it out.  Would you say he's  the Ryan Seacrest of  Sliders?  No, I'm not Sliders. 
[04:04:30]  It's probably the Food Network.  Not the show, Eric.  Not what your movie's  based on.  I mean the sandwiches.  Would you say he's  the Ryan Seacrest of BLTs?  Look, he makes  delicious food.  I mean, I was there  before the Open  and he cooked me  delicious food.  He cooked it himself?  Yeah.  I've never seen that man  pick up a spatula.  He cooks.  I didn't know he cooked.  Yeah.  I thought he just  goes to restaurants  and bleaches his hair.  No, he shows  other cooks how to do it.  It's very delicious.  I thought all he did  was sit around,  find places that have  good sandwiches,  and manscape his goatee.  You're telling me 
[04:05:00]  he also cooks?  He cooks.  He plans a menu  and everything.  So where does he find  the time to pick out  all those bracelets?  I don't know.  Probably his people.  He's a superman.  Yeah.  He's a superman.  He finds time to cook  and accessorize?  A churrasho steak?  It was fucking amazing.  A what steak?  I don't see churrasho.  It's like the churrasho  sauce on top.  Is that on the menu there?  Because I don't see churrasho.  I do see he has Reno,  which is popcorn-crusted  popcorn chicken  stuffed inside guys' 
[04:05:30]  nothing but fancy meatloaf  and super banged  in a volcano  of Tabasco butter.  The hobo appetizers.  We pour it into  a lucite heel,  smother it  with our own  special jalapeno  sugar brew  and set it on your lap  on a neon sign.  Serve drunk  and on fire.  Add a Cinnabon  or two Cinnabons.  $4.95.  It's not healthy food,  Roland.  It's delicious.  These people are just assholes. 
[04:06:00]  The hobo,  lobo,  bordello,  slam jam appetizer.  38 ounces  of super saddened  cheese-gutted wolf meat.  Lambast it  with honey pickle  wasabi  and pile drive it  into an Ed Hardy  designed bucket  sprayed with axe  finished with  a demi-glaze  of thick  and funky  mushroom driblins.  And they're just assholes.  It is,  but they're hilarious assholes.  It's probably  Peter Wells'  dick family. 
[04:06:30]  You think that  it's Peter Wells  from the New York Times.  You think his family  is designing fake  Guy Fieri menus.  It's the same font  in everything.  It's genius how it's done.  Does he serve wolf meat?  I don't know  if he could eat wolf meat.  I don't know either.  Does he spray his food  with axe?  Because the wolf meat  there on the menu  is sprayed with axe.  I don't think so.  He probably uses axe.  He smells good.  Oh, Guy Fieri.  Listen,  we have to make room  for Ron and Fez, right?  Or do we have a couple minutes? 
[04:07:00]  You've got about  another minute.  Oh, okay.  Well,  if you're from out of town  and you don't have a chance  to check out  Guy Fieri's restaurant,  make sure you at least  check out this website  because  I'm sorry, Roland.  It's the funniest shit  that I've ever seen.  Why would you be  a public figure  and not make sure  that all domain names  are taken care of?  That's some 1999 shit.  Yeah, I'll get a hold of him  today and see  where we can go.  All right, let's see  if we can get him  either on O&A  or after O&A. 
[04:07:30]  If they don't want him,  I'll take him.  I'll clean up the scraps,  Opie and Anthony.  Do they have to talk  about this yet?  No, I haven't talked about it yet.  Might be able to talk  about it tomorrow.  Who knows?  Probably do a better job  than me.  Listen, stay tuned.  How is that possible?  Maybe you're right, Roland.  Maybe you're right.  Are you bummed about  wrestling being out  of the Olympics?  It is.  Golf is being added  to the Olympics  and wrestling taken out.  Probably since he played  golf last week,  Tiger Woods and...  Golf is a sport  that retired athletes play. 
[04:08:00]  Fat guys play it.  Exactly.  Roland, no offense to you,  you could play golf.  In Slabo!  Stay tuned.  Eric, you like  when he calls you that?  I didn't call him that.  Slabo?  Did you hear him  call you Slabo just now?  I didn't call him Slabo.  Time is up.  Oh, I guess time is up.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Thank you, everybody.  Goodbye.  Hit it, Slabo!  The O.P. and Anthony show  is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
