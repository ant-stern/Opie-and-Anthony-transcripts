<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton in studio.  Norton complained about exhaustion.  They then covered several disturbing news stories: a brutal assault on an elderly woman, the murder of two young girls by their father (with graphic details provided), and a fatal police shooting following a chase. The hosts expressed strong disapproval of the perpetrators.  The conversation transitioned to Don Imus's apparent interest in their "Spread the Virus" t-shirts, with Opie giving an update on fulfilling orders. They discussed the show's regional popularity, fielding calls from various locations, including a particularly uneventful call from Utah. A caller mentioned Imus's comparison of a photo of Opie and Imus to a gay bathhouse couple.

Further news stories followed, including a Cessna incident in D.C. and a woman severely beaten on a loading dock.  Humorous banter ensued, including a fictionalized New York Post interpretation of Rolling Stones song titles.  A significant portion involved a phone conversation with Jim Norton, who was guest-hosting another radio show. Opie and Anthony listened in, commenting and interrupting, with Norton discussing comedy clubs, gambling, and encounters in adult entertainment establishments. They continued trying to reach Norton throughout the segment.

The show then featured their "Play Other People's Radio Shows" segment, playing a recording of Rich Voss.  A listener called to report their local Minneapolis/St. Paul station playing Opie and Anthony's "butt plugs" bit.  Several listeners complained about the length of the "Play Other People's Radio Shows" segment. Technical difficulties caused humorous speculation.  The broadcast then focused on the Capitol Building and White House evacuation due to a small plane entering restricted airspace.  They played news clips and late-night comedy segments from Jay Leno and David Letterman.  Listener calls expressed disbelief at the President's actions during the crisis. A pilot called in to describe a similar near-miss with fighter jets.

The Michael Jackson trial and Macaulay Culkin's testimony were discussed, including audio clips purportedly from Jackson's bedroom. The hosts analyzed the prosecution's perceived failures in high-profile cases (O.J. Simpson, Robert Blake, Rodney King, etc.).  Opie recounted a bizarre story about a Bill O'Reilly producer, Stephanie, who made sexual advances towards him, culminating in a naked bath and a shouting match in her apartment.

A segment detailed a strange encounter with a woman with a prosthetic arm, unbeknownst to the hosts and crew until a CD signing at Hooters where a beer fight occurred.  Her subsequent activities with the crew (including smoking pot with "Stinky" and taking inappropriate photos) were described.  Corey from Yonkers called to confirm the woman's presence.  Clips from the Michael Jackson trial were played, followed by a call from Eric in Indianapolis.  The hosts recounted embarrassing crew member Ben by staring at his genitals.  The show included prank calls about "caulk," a discussion of Jimmy's failed date, and numerous voicemails from a psycho ex-girlfriend angry about various issues.  Rich Voss called to explain his omission of Opie and Anthony on another show, followed by more voicemails from the ex-girlfriend.  A call from TJ and a discussion about the Yankees also occurred.


The show continued with voicemail messages from a woman detailing a bitter breakup with "Matt." The hosts debated the authenticity of the calls.  The conversation switched to wrestling, featuring WWE champion John Cena and members of his rap group in studio. Cena discussed his wrestling career, rap music (including "You Can't See Me"), relationships with other wrestlers, and censorship on television.  Crude and offensive language was prevalent, alongside listener calls with personal stories and opinions.

A sex advice segment featuring Sue Johansson, a grandmother giving explicit blowjob instructions, was played.  The hosts made sexually explicit jokes.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the voicemail messages and promotion of O&A Party Rock merchandise.


A substantial portion focused on a caller's grandmother, described as an "old lady sex expert," who gave graphic oral sex advice. The hosts and callers reacted with laughter and crude jokes. Detailed descriptions of sexual acts and humorous comparisons (e.g., oral sex to a trombone) were featured. Numerous listener calls followed, many referencing earlier discussions. Audio clips of Nancy Reagan discussing Ronald Reagan's death were played, juxtaposed with comedic commentary and contrasting music.  Gamefly.com was briefly promoted.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that thanks.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  We will be in the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Okay. 
[00:04:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, anyway.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm funny. 
[00:05:00]  You like movies about gladiators?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Asshole!  You just mind your pees and pews, Buster,  and remember who you're dealing with.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:30]  Good morning.  Good morning, Anthony.  How's that bagel?  Bagley.  How's your pinched nerve?  Pinchy.  It's very pinchy, huh?  Morning, Norton.  Hi.  Hi.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm a zombie today.  You're a zombie?  I'm tired.  I haven't been sleeping.  I'm just cranky.  It's just...  Why not, kitten?  I don't know.  You're barely on mic, too.  I tossed and turned.  You're dead? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I tossed and turned last night.  I just couldn't sleep, man.  Yeah.  Why don't we just all go home?  I'm packing in today.  Why don't we just hit that button over there and go into another...  Worst of show.  Just roll something and go to sleep?  No, we're going to have a great show today.  I guarantee it.  Yes, we are.  I was skating down the sidewalk and I saw Anthony ahead of me, walking like a homeless person.  It's hilarious.  I'm reading in the morning.  Yeah, he gets all his news off his cell phone.  So, as I'm walking from the garage here, I'm reading the news. 
[00:06:30]  Hmm.  Yeah.  And Opie comes skating up on me.  Well, I've got to be careful.  Very cautious.  Because he's very, you know, he's very on edge in the morning.  I'm leery there.  You know, I'm always looking out for any predators.  You know, the people that go, which way is north?  And then they punch you and you hear Christmas music.  Yeah, speaking of which...  Wake up in the hospital.  Just before the show, Danny was showing me that video of the old lady in the alley. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  That is disturbing, man.  Some old lady and some big guy walks up to her and I guess is asking her a question.  Perhaps even which way is north?  And out of nowhere, just punches her right in the face.  She is laid out.  Boom.  And then they show him going through her pockets and stuff.  And then he just walks away with her valuables.  Yeah, punched her hard.  Is that video up on the websites?  Yeah, it's somewhere.  It's really, really disturbing.  We'll get it. 
[00:07:30]  We'll find 20 of those.  We'll get it up on opianathlete.com.  I guess it was a security camera.  And she had like a shopping cart.  And she obviously was trying to do the right thing.  Yeah.  The guy engaged her and the guy's at least a foot taller than her.  Just run away.  You don't want to be perceived as a bad guy or a racist or anything like that.  Just run away.  You know, at this point, though, she couldn't run.  No.  She was like the injured gazelle.  Just waiting there.  Oh, yeah.  And having her teeth sunk into her neck.  There was absolutely nothing she could do. 
[00:08:00]  Bam.  He laid her out.  Didn't even hit her with an old lady punch.  That was a punch he uses for everybody.  Just the blanket punch.  Just clocked her.  Mm-hmm.  Is it clear footage?  Is it good footage?  Or is it like cheesy?  As far as security camera footage goes, it's pretty good.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you watch it and you're definitely disturbed.  You're just like, ugh, what an animal.  And there's people out there that'll defend a guy like that.  Ah, I know.  And that's what just amazes me about this country.  It's society that pushed him to the point that he has to do these things just to survive. 
[00:08:30]  Shut up.  Kill him.  People, you mean ACLU.  Right.  Amnesty International.  Uh-huh.  Who does some good things, but, you know, defending a guy who punches an old lady in the face.  Yeah.  How about we don't?  Yeah.  Especially with no reason for it.  It wasn't like she, you know, spoke when not being spoken to.  I want to see the lawyer that defends the father that killed his daughter and her friend.  Did you already read the...  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:00]  What do they say now?  That, uh...  This is the guy that stabbed his daughter...  Stabbed his daughter, like, 30 times.  And her friend.  The friend 11 times.  Yeah.  Two of the times the daughter stabbed her right in the eyes.  Yeah.  Right in the eyes.  Like, this guy just is really a kook and just needs to be removed from this planet.  He's a roach and he should just be squashed.  Got a whole record of violence.  All kinds of arrests for assault and menacing with a chainsaw. 
[00:09:30]  Like, the guy is completely insane.  Looks like he's been punched quite a few times in quite a few fights.  And then he decides to be a tough guy with eight-year-old girls.  And, um, yeah.  Killed his daughter and her friend because she wouldn't listen to him.  He went to this park to tell her it was time to come home.  She said no.  So he punched her in the face twice.  She falls on the ground.  Her little friend comes up to help her.  And that's when this guy says, 
[00:10:00]  The little friend pulled out a little knife.  And this will be used as a defense in court.  Yep.  Guaranteed, the defense is going to try to argue that this man felt threatened by an eight-year-old girl.  This animal felt threatened by an eight-year-old girl with a knife.  And had to defend himself by stabbing them each, you know, numerous times.  And killing them both.  And then he, uh, he leaves, obviously.  Calls the cops. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, helps out with the search.  And a little while later, finds them both.  He's the guy, ooh, finds them in this heavily wooded area.  And, uh, the cops are asking him questions.  And they said the questions didn't really, his answers didn't really jive with somebody that, uh, just found their daughter, uh, butchered.  So.  Punch her in the face twice.  Twice.  Just, you, just fucking shoot somebody, man.  Just drag him out back and put a bullet in his head.  Yeah.  China has the right idea sometimes.  Mm-hmm.  The judicial system pretty much stinks.  But when they know you did something, they just put you in the middle of the square. 
[00:11:00]  And they put a bullet in your head and they charge your family for the bullet.  That's it.  Do they really?  Yeah.  Certain, certain cases.  Oh, God.  Why waste the time and money?  The guy did it.  Fessed up to it.  That's it.  It's obvious he did it.  Why are we, why are we spending any time on this?  I love, I love the argument.  Well, it costs more money to execute someone than to, to put them in prison for life.  In prison for life.  Yeah, but the person's still alive.  I don't give a fuck about the money. 
[00:11:30]  I've never cared about the money.  Yeah.  I don't care about the cost effectiveness.  We waste money in this country every single day.  I don't give a shit.  How about you just kill the guy?  Enough already.  This guy does not deserve to live.  And he's one of these assholes that'll, you know, he, he, he's been in jail enough.  That doesn't scare him.  It's nothing that he, uh, you know, he'll go to jail and probably, probably the big mook  like him does very well in prison.  Why, why put him there?  I don't know.  Put him somewhere that he can't, uh, hurt anyone else. 
[00:12:00]  In the grave.  Stab two little girls, they tend to put, uh, crushed glass in your food.  There you go.  Spitness.  The other convicts don't smile on that.  Yeah, but, I don't know.  The guy should just be eliminated.  I agree.  Elimination.  Oh, there's that clip of the guy with the big police chase and, and apparently they shot  him at the end of this chase.  Yeah, this is the video of the morning.  Uh, the local news said, ah, we're not going to show you to get, uh, shot.  Where, where did this happen?  That guy. 
[00:12:30]  Where did this happen?  California, I guess.  Uh, this is where he jumps out of the car right here.  And I guess.  Did they show it?  Come on.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  You see one shot.  That's the first bullet going through the, the window.  Yeah.  It looks like it goes through the window and then hits him.  Wow.  The guy gets up to run and they shot him.  Why wouldn't they show that though?  Why wouldn't they show that?  Oh, the stupid news.  I don't know.  Show it.  Here's another clip.  The SUV that they fired, I don't know how many rounds, 10 cops, something like 90 rounds 
[00:13:00]  they fired into that SUV.  Wow, they're not messing around anymore with these police chases.  And, and the guy was just slightly injured and another cop was hit in the vest by one  of his, uh, fellow cops.  Why did they shoot and kill the other guy?  I don't know.  He just got up and ran out of the car.  Well, it looks like.  They just chase him down.  Yeah.  It looked like he didn't have any weapons or anything.  I mean, what's the, what's the story on that?  I would guess there's one move he made when he got out.  For a second, I actually thought he pulled something.  A little threatening.  I guarantee you they thought he did.  Yeah.  Cause that's watching on the video.  I actually thought he was turning to, to do something. 
[00:13:30]  And they were chasing him like murder also.  It wasn't like he was just, you know, they, they picked him up and, and he ran from the  cops.  They knew what he had done.  Right.  That's the way the police chases should end.  That's it.  In a hail of gunfire.  Yeah.  With the suspect dead.  All right.  Let's go to John in New York city.  John, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Uh, your friend Don Imus was just talking about you here.  He needs, he needs a t-shirt bed.  Are you serious?  I'm serious.  And, and, and Sid, Sid, Sid said he tried to call you yesterday, but you wouldn't return 
[00:14:00]  his call.  Uh, he must have a different number for me.  I didn't, I didn't get a call from Sid.  Sid Rosenberg, who does the show with Imus.  Tell Sid to call 516.  That's just asking your number, Opie.  Anyway, I just thought I'd pass that along.  He needs a t-shirt bed.  All right.  I guess Imus has ordered one of the Opie and Anthony spread the virus t-shirts.  Uh, and my brother's just in a massive panic.  I'm going to wear it down on the ranch is what I want to do with a cowboy hat.  I want a big spread the virus cowboy hat and bandana. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, maybe my brother can start selling those.  Imus and I could get our brothers together and they could, they could make some fine money  on the side.  Cash in.  Yeah.  My brother's in a major panic.  He's getting shirts printed as we speak.  He's mailing them out.  Is he, are you keeping tabs on him?  Is he doing well?  Yeah.  I'm making sure his head doesn't explode.  Yeah.  He took on this project pretty much by himself and with one of his roommates.  And, uh, you know, you and I have to go sign shirts.  Yeah.  It's just a whole big deal now. 
[00:15:00]  By the way, he needs us to sign more, uh, Opie and Anthony wow stickers.  Really?  It's a whole thing that is happening now.  A whole thing.  Imus will get his shirt and be all complaining that we didn't sign it.  Where's my autograph?  I don't want an autograph.  He probably wants an autographed Opie and Anthony spread the virus t-shirt.  But, uh, I guess we gotta sign shirts.  We gotta sign bumper stickers.  Wow.  He's still taking pre-orders.  Has he made any it?  Uh, I guess, uh, I guess he went to the printer yesterday or where it's going today. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  But he's in a major, major panic.  Major panic.  He's trying to hire people now.  Get a staff?  He has to.  I mean, the sales are pretty good.  There's no real, there's no real money in it.  There's no real money when you, you sell t-shirts and stuff, but.  Not really, no.  I mean, he'll, he'll do okay.  There's no real money in that t-shirt stuff, right?  You'd be surprised.  Well, you have good weekends.  Well, the money, the money is when you, yeah, you do a live appearance and you sell the, 
[00:16:00]  the shirts there.  Yep.  You know, because he has to mail all these out.  I know.  It's just overhead.  I mean, you gotta see his apartment.  He's got the, you know, the envelopes all ready to go and stamps and it's just.  Oh, he's ready.  Oh, he's ready to go.  He's ready to go.  So, I guess, I guess you could still pre-order.  I don't know.  I don't either.  I guess until the run of, the first run of shirts is done, I guess you could continue to  pre-order.  So, uh, you're running out of time.  That's, that's, uh, that's definite.  So, go to opianthony.com.  There's a little link to get to my brother to order your Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus 
[00:16:30]  t-shirts.  These things are becoming very, very hot property, Anthony.  Yes, they are.  People like the design and all.  Or you could email him, uh, doctor, spell out doctor.  Dr. Duck, D-U-K, at AOL.com and, uh, he'll get back to you.  And to answer your question, it can be very lucrative in certain markets.  However, when you're standing outside of a West Palm Beach improv hawking CDs and DVDs,  make sure you have plenty of room in that suitcase when you're coming home.  That's so weird. 
[00:17:00]  That is the weird thing about what we're doing, man.  In some cities, we are just rock stars.  In other cities, people just want to throw rocks at us.  They don't care.  Oh.  And it goes from, like, West Palm was really slow, and then the Fort Lauderdale, another  place we were never on, was actually very good for a first time down.  It was like you could really see it.  It's a younger demo.  It's a better...  I'm starting to notice, like, hot spots around the country where the show is popular.  Yeah.  You know, we got the basics.  New York, Philly, Boston, part of Washington's pretty hot. 
[00:17:30]  Cleveland is massive.  Buffalo's pretty good.  And then, like, little pockets are starting to pop up.  Like, Oklahoma City, for some reason, likes the show.  I don't get that.  You know?  And then there's, like, parts of Chicago.  Yep.  You know, it's just slowly, you know, getting hot in other areas.  Parts of Chicago.  Let's just say the north side.  Utah.  We haven't got one phone call from Utah yet.  No?  Not one.  It might have been from a trucker.  We did get, actually, but it might have been a trucker going through.  Maybe a trucker going through.  Yeah.  And then we got, like, Minnesota checking in a lot, all of a sudden. 
[00:18:00]  Like this guy, Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, Lollipop.  Hi, Jeff.  Lollipop.  Just wanted to say, I just got home from work here, and I watch Imas every morning.  They put that picture up of Opie and Don there.  Yeah, that was magnificent.  But his newsman, Chuck, said that you two look like a couple standing at the entryway of a gay bathhouse.  Yes.  A gay bathhouse.  So I giggled a little bit, but nonetheless, say, Jimmy, when are you going to ever come to Minnesota? 
[00:18:30]  I'd like to get out there.  I've never been.  There's a place, a comedy club out there I'd love to work, so sooner or later, hopefully.  You know, there's that picture.  I was in Huntington, my hometown, and Imas went to the local bookstore to sign books.  And there's not many people I'll go out to see, but I'm like, Imas, God, I've got to meet him, you know.  And we just hit it off big time, and we took that picture.  And it's kind of scary, because he definitely looks like he likes to say he looks like my father.  But I would have to add grand in front of that. 
[00:19:00]  Because there is a similarity for some weird reason, but he looks like he could be like my grandfather.  There it is.  Just popped it up here.  Yeah.  He likes to say, oh, I look like I'm Opie's father.  Well, not really.  Not really.  Oh, he's got that big full head of hair.  Yeah.  It's kind of creepy how much we, uh...  You could kind of be your dad.  God, does that, that's what I've got to look forward to on the ride.  That's it.  I think you need a little more drug and alcohol abuse.  All right, well, I'll start today.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:19:30]  Looks like an older gentleman that's just fond of you.  Fond of?  Yeah.  Someone who wants to sit you down, maybe rub some scented oils on your shoulders.  Give me a little talking to.  Yeah, nothing crazy.  A little bit more.  Maybe lay in the back in a pillow in a dark room.  Nothing sexual.  Just rub a little oil on your stomach.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Feel that V.  All right, let's go to Larry on Long Island.  Larry.  Yeah, how you doing?  You guys got a mess out there this morning, huh?  There was a police chase on the Southern State Parkway this morning.  We don't get many of our own chases here in New York.  Well, right now, of course, without, I'm stuck on the Sunrise Highway for the last hour. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Do you usually use Southern State?  Yeah, I take Southern State to all over to Brooklyn.  Now, I'm taking Sunrise to the belt.  There was a massive police chase, I guess, at four in the morning.  Yeah, someone rolled their car.  I guess whoever they were chasing stopped traffic.  I love when they do the long camera shot.  All right, here's the accident.  And then they go, now let's look at the traffic.  And you just look, and it never ends. 
[00:20:30]  As Anthony would say, I hope the guy is dead.  We already know that he's in the hospital with minor injuries.  Minor injuries, he's fine.  Oh, well, that sucks.  Yeah.  All right, what do you got, Larry?  Well, I got my news day paper today came in a sleeve.  The whole sleeve's covered with XM radio.  And they're giving away, buy one XM radio, get one free.  Yeah, that's the new huge promotion that XM's doing.  All right, then you guys are mentioned in there. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, okay, what page, it's a pullout?  Well, it's, no, it's a sleeve.  It's a plastic sleeve covering the paper, and then you got a little pamphlet.  And inside the pamphlet, it advertises Major League Baseball, MTV, Opian Anthony, a couple  of other NASCAR, and MSNBC.  Oh, right on.  That's very cool.  I'll have to pick that up today.  Thanks, Larry.  All right, have a great day, guys.  Be cool.  All right, let's go to Utah.  Utah, here's Clark from Utah. 
[00:21:30]  Clark.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, man?  Hey, I just want to let you guys know, you used to have one fan in Utah that liked you  guys from XM radio.  Thank you.  That's why you're calling?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'm trying to spread the virus, but it's not the state that's conducive to your guys'  consumer.  Where do you live out there?  Is it a city, or do you live out in the middle of nowhere?  I live in Salt Lake City.  Oh, yeah.  I used to live in Seattle, but I moved down there.  The cost of living is a lot cheaper down there. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  I'm trying to spread it, but my Mormon cousins, they just haven't got it yet.  You got Mormon cousins?  Salt Lake City.  Oh, yeah.  I have one cousin that has eight kids.  Jesus.  How many wives?  Just one, but his wife had another husband who died of knee surgery.  He died of knee surgery?  Yeah, they didn't know he was allergic to penicillin, and he died afterwards.  You sure he wasn't a fat comic? 
[00:22:30]  Pretty sure.  Pretty sure.  But he has two sets of twins, and when you go over there to visit, I mean, that house is  a mad house.  Wow.  All right.  Well, thank you, Clark.  You guys have a great day.  You, too.  Goodbye, Clark.  Danny, make sure no one else calls from Utah.  Ever.  Ever.  Awful.  Utah has been banned from this program.  That was the most boring phone call we've ever taken.  He didn't even need to say Utah. 
[00:23:00]  He could have just talked.  We would have gone, ah, call from Utah.  And you know what?  He's one of the cool ones.  That's the sad part about that.  Yeah.  Someone's saying that Sid called Rick, our old producer, for some reason, for the shirt.  Maybe he said that on the air, that he's been trying to get in touch with you.  Oh, really?  Calling Rick.  Yeah, I don't really talk to Rick anymore.  No?  No.  I don't talk to Rick anymore.  I don't talk to Sandy anymore.  Oh, boy.  That family's kind of out of my life right now.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Anthony, the big story, these airheads.  Yeah.  This is great.  The New York Post thought it really wasn't a big story.  But Newsday and the Daily News here in New York both are using the front page of their papers to talk about this Cessna in D.C. there.  You know, you're a pilot.  I guess you had a student in there, too.  A student pilot.  You're trying to learn how to fly.  Or you're the teacher.  You're teaching this guy how to fly. 
[00:24:00]  And the Daily News calls you dimwits.  Can I interrupt?  We might have a wacky radio alert.  I'm sorry.  Sam in Virginia.  Sam.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  Delight.  Miss Voss.  Have you started playing yet?  Can you guess me, too?  That's what I heard.  I don't know.  What are you going to think for me?  Quarter-inch of two?  He was going to her job. 
[00:24:30]  Coming home from her job vending T-shirts.  It doesn't matter if it's stopping.  This guy approaches her on the loading dock.  And you see it on the video.  Punches her in the face.  Her head, she gets hit.  Her head slams her to the wall.  She goes down.  He starts kicking her.  And she didn't die?  No.  No.  He really, I mean, he beat her good.  And she's good.  I mean, someone's amazing.  She, oh, it's a 300-plus conference.  And, of course, I mean, the end of the video.  So she's laying on the ground.  I mean, lifeless.  And the last thing you see, him digging through her fanny pack.  That's what we watched.  And the Republicans want to put that guy away. 
[00:25:00]  The levels are going, oh, he had a tough childhood.  This is exactly what we just did.  Straight knuckles.  Well, that's not you.  Is boss listening to us on his Wi-Fi in Virginia?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  When he was hit, though, did his knuckles hit the ground?  And that's what I'm saying.  Could you track?  Well, you're the guy.  You didn't say that thing in a different way.  I'm saying he hit him.  And on the ground, sometimes you're missing your head.  Just enough.  That's all I'm trying to say. 
[00:25:30]  That was my case.  From Fort Lauderdale, a 70-year-old woman there, surviving a nine-story fall from a condo tower when she landed on a canopy.  How old?  70.  You know, these ladies, these old elderly have a death wish.  She was cleaning her belt for you.  Tackling?  God, stop laughing so we can listen to Voss.  Nine stories.  Well, what people don't know is she should talk to some T-shirt.  What?  They couldn't spit that out.  Nine. 
[00:26:00]  Nine stories.  Nine stories.  I'll have a broken arm.  Another non-select threatening injury.  And the whole thing goes, what's it going to take to kill grandma?  How are we going to get this money?  Nine stories.  Do we have to buy her another apartment?  Maybe eight more stories higher?  The dredge report says...  Wow, that laughing is driving me nuts.  It really is awful.  ...there with Paul Abdul because he can describe a distinguishing characteristic on her body. 
[00:26:30]  He says it's one that few have seen, only those who have been intimate with her.  According to...  Guano?  ...all summer long, she calls it an outrageous violation of her privacy.  Oh, but now she's not denying it.  Now she's not saying it's not true.  Now she's just saying it's an invasion of her privacy.  Well, the people speaking for her are saying it.  What's the big deal?  So she's slept with somebody.  Hasn't that happened all the time at work and stuff?  Yeah.  So what's anybody...  Neither of them are married, right?  No, but she was a judge on the show. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  That would paint American Idol.  Even though he had gotten kicked off the road.  You don't want...  Wasn't he already kicked off?  No.  No, no, not while they were angry.  Really?  No.  He got kicked off for beating up.  It's so much happens while you're working at night.  Yeah.  Yeah, you miss all the American Idol.  You miss all the primetime TV.  I got it.  That's him.  Now, after I heard about the story, they've obviously been back on the air.  Hasn't it been brought up on the...  No.  No.  Hasn't it been brought up?  It's just the dumbest guy.  Hasn't it been brought up?  It's been brought up. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, it was stupid.  And then I saw the white singer that thinks he's Ralphie May got kicked off or something.  The white singer who thinks he's Ralphie May?  He's Ralphie May.  I like Ralphie May.  He's a good friend of mine.  I think he's been here next week, actually.  I think he's coming in, yeah.  He really is a good friend.  Oh, hysterical guy. 
[00:28:00]  Did he get married yet?  No.  No, no, they're getting married.  Are you going to the wedding?  I think so.  Fourth of July.  That's what it is?  I think it's Fourth of July.  Is it Fourth?  Yeah, Fourth of July.  I don't know.  I'm getting it.  When that guy starts cackling, Vos should grab some of that shit behind his ear and smear  it under the guy's nose.  See how quickly that turns to weeping.  It's a small thing.  Thank you.  Awful.  Do you know?  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  And we'll have a party in New York for my friends and some of her friends and a party 
[00:28:30]  in L.A., like wedding receptions in New York, L.A.  You gone to Edmonton with her yet?  She lives outside of Edmonton, like two hours or a little...  She comes from a farm.  She's a farm girl.  Right.  On cold water.  But I've been to Edmonton and the mall stinks.  That mall is unbelievable.  Like this?  Dude, there's a water park and a casino in the mall.  Yeah, that's true.  That's outrageous!  Great.  Okay, this.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good. 
[00:29:00]  It's good.  When I go to a mall, I want to buy clothes.  You can get that there.  They didn't have hiring.  Oh, really?  You can get clothes at a mall?  Who knew?  Sure, you can get that.  I wear...  See, I don't wear...  I don't wear just discovery t-shirts like that.  That is the worst laugh in my life.  Wow, that is really bad.  It's not a gift.  You go out and you buy nice clothing.  When you have no other addictions, you want to fill the void. 
[00:29:30]  Because you lack spirituality.  Spirituality?  Jesus, what?  Spirituality.  Rick, there's a you in that word.  Have a lot of you beat up an 80-year-old.  I have...  Oh, that laugh.  That's the laugh you have when you're looking for your naughty daughter and her friend in a park.  Oh, God.  I have a...  I'm Rick Asachi.  I have a Hugo Boss.  Donna Karens.  I have a Calvin Klein.  No, it's not.  I'm not.  You go on stage where... 
[00:30:00]  I don't wear...  No, tomorrow I'll wear...  Tomorrow, Saturday.  I didn't bring the whole suit.  I bought the top.  And I'll wear a t-shirt under it.  And a vest.  No, I won't.  Yeah, a cover button.  It's like it's swinging.  So, all right?  I'm on the I Suck Tour.  I have a Risashi suit, yes.  You know?  We're going to watch.  A Risashi suit?  What?  Oh, my God.  I just got to look like...  I was like my mom when we were kids. 
[00:30:30]  We had a bad car.  This is like watching your chick cheat on you, man.  Yeah.  We're the fat guy.  We're the fat chick.  We're the guy who can't get a rod.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Watch Danny bang your chick.  This is our Rich.  I'm proud of Dan.  Really?  What happened to you?  I got shit up on eBay all night.  I have a spinny.  I go from poor to eBay.  I'm ordering.  You know what I'm going to order today?  This is how nuts I am. 
[00:31:00]  P.F. Flyers.  Sneakers.  Do you remember those?  You're not old enough.  P.F. Flyers?  What are those?  Those were sneakers back when I was a little kid.  They sell them again.  Really?  They sell them online.  You know, I'm going to get a couple pairs today.  Why is that funny?  P.F. Flyers.  It's only funny if, like, Mabel King says it.  Do you have a really bad, bad night?  Oh, no.  Because I was winning so much. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  It was unfair to the casino.  It just kept coming.  What show is this?  DC 101, you were telling me, Eric?  Yeah, 101.  You were really selling necklaces, weren't you?  Back in the day.  Were you really?  I heard or you were? 
[00:32:00]  I got anything.  Someone call Voss's phone now.  Oh, yeah.  Call Voss's phone.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  You hear the stories last time you were here.  I hear it ring.  Well, you know, I mean, gambling was bad.  Last run, I lost eight grand.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Oh, I lost eight grand.  Well, I kind of.  Well, you know, I mean, it was mine.  I need to steal it.  I beat up an $83.  I'll wait.  You laid me.  I can't say.  Well, it wasn't really $80 grand in cash.  I think it's awful.  T-shirts.  We're shooting craps in the streets. 
[00:32:30]  I got $83,000 worth of T-shirts.  We got four people calling Voss's phone right now.  I put them all down on a hard sex.  I lost.  I smashed my nose against the ring.  And I threw my hand out of a window.  It's nine stories.  Hey, stupid.  We're listening to you on the radio right now.  You're very funny, but you're a mush-mouthed ass.  Versace suits.  Hey, don't people normally have sex? 
[00:33:00]  That's a really salient point about American Idol.  Everyone's leaving messages for them all over the place now.  So it's the other way.  Blackjack is fun, but you're right.  Once you hit a craps table, everything else slows down.  Yeah, but what tables are you playing?  What's the minimum bid?  Oh, here's the female bitch to wreck the pit.  This is the broad wishes to be wrecked.  Hold on, I got a call from home.  Honey, can I have some of this fruitcake? 
[00:33:30]  I'm working hard, I promise.  He's probably running around with a dust buster in his hand.  No, listen to me.  I would play sea craps.  Even if you're on a crotchable, even if you're a minimum, that's $5.  It doesn't matter, because you're still trying on the path line.  If you stand behind it, and then your numbers, you're right.  But if you get going, you're $30 into it.  Oh, easily.  You're going to get boss grueling talking about gambling. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, you play $10 games.  You know, it could be $100 a roll.  And then you look like a pussy if you take money back instead of pressing it.  I don't think that's bad.  Press it if you're winning.  Press it.  And then all of the stuff is on the table, and then the prick rolls and suddenly it's done.  You get no money.  It's so funny.  You could be at a crotchable.  And when a crotchable is out, everybody's winning.  People are high-fiving.  You can see, like, the Klan and Farrakhan high-fiving each other.  I'm telling you, people are coming together.  You know, you don't even care about the, you know, Middle Eastern smell that's standing 
[00:34:30]  next to you.  Wow.  Enough with the laugh.  People are tables.  You stink.  I would yell at them.  They'd throw the dice.  And I would, you know, one time I, someone cried, I threw my hands up like, and the waitress  was right behind me with a big tray of drinks.  And I just flew, knocked the drinks all in the sky and stuff.  You know it's bad when you get kicked off a crap table.  I was kicked out of a, I was kicked out of a peep boot building. 
[00:35:00]  A peep boot?  A peep boot.  A peep boot.  Right.  And there was these, you know, those, you can go in where the ladies would, would watch.  You can't say a B and a P sound back to back.  No.  You can just make a decision on which one to drop on the fly.  A peep boot.  A peep boot.  The next thing I know, I'm arguing with them and saying, I got kicked out of a peep boot.  Did you have a fight with those women?  I got kicked out of a peep boot.  No, no, but I was against one of them.  And if you put the money and then you go to the next room where they have the chair and  then there's the plexiglass and they're in there.  Yeah.  But they want you to pull down your pants to prove that you're not vice. 
[00:35:30]  Uh-huh.  So I had, like for my time, I had a woman literally scream at me for 10 minutes, pull down your  pants.  I'm not taking my pants off.  Like it's skeevy in there.  And she literally fought with me.  And so when she finally realized I wasn't going to take my pants down, I get this routine.  Visual.  Horrible.  And there's so much, you know, can you say semen?  Yes, you can.  Semen on the floor.  Sperm, skee, whatever you want to go.  Not my gum. 
[00:36:00]  You know, somebody, you know, somebody cleansed that up.  Somebody cleansed that up.  But somebody didn't get that job.  Somebody has to go home.  We just play other people's shows.  I know, that's great.  Let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.  We just play other people's shows and sit here.  Sean, what's up?  We're going to do a celebrity interview.  We'll just play Voss on the wrong.  Sean.  It sounds like Voss is getting interviewed by Alvin and the Chickmonks.  The Chickmonks?  This is a moron.  We'll get you to the morning. 
[00:36:30]  I think that's it.  I was, that was, whoever was, Sam, thank you.  That was awesome.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, good pickup today.  Thank you.  This is a beautiful idea.  Like, Robert Plant's in New York somewhere doing press.  And we, for whatever reason, can't get him in.  Yeah.  So, let's just find out where he is and play that interview.  We'll play that interview.  You can just sit here.  Yeah, we'll get our own guests.  Yeah.  We'll get our own guests.  We'll just pick them off of other people's shows like that.  That's so weird to see one of our boys on another radio station.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  That's the way it is on commercial, though.  Did you notice?  It's like he's cheating on us with a fat chick, like we said.  God, I mean, the show wasn't that bad, but that laugh was awful.  And then the chick that I knew to just shut her trap and get ready for the news.  Shut up.  Take some coffee.  All right, well, that was fun.  That killed ten minutes.  I can't even do the laugh.  I'm trying.  It hurts to do it.  Yeah, Jim's got it. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, at everything.  Laughing before even the punchline.  Quiet.  How was your food, Ant?  Oh, good bagel.  Was that Elliot?  God, he's supposed to be this edgy guy, and he has a laugh like that on his show.  He's done that for years.  Wow.  Really?  He's done that for years, laugh? 
[00:38:00]  Well, we all have.  No, that annoying laugh.  That annoying laugh.  That poor jokes, man.  All right, why don't we take a quick break, Anthony?  All right.  We'll get right into the whole White House thing.  Oh, big panic in D.C. yesterday.  Yeah, a lot going on in the news, and also the New York Post trying to be funny.  Oh, we love that.  One of my favorite, favorite things we do on the program.  Who doesn't love when the newspapers here in New York break out the comedy?  They bring the funny, Opie.  They take a story that's been in the news, and they put their unique little twist on it, 
[00:38:30]  and add this comedic element that's just a scream.  Well, today, the Stones are back with all new songs.  Oh, so I would gather they probably have some of the Stones songs.  All the new songs that they're going to play on tour.  Yes.  And we'll tell you what they are right after these messages.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Talk about the silliness of sex, because it's something we talk about from time to time, 
[00:39:00]  where, you know, you're with your lady, and you get into some crazy stuff.  You know, you've had a few.  Maybe you're toking up.  Yeah.  Drinking a little, and you decide to have some of that crazy monkey-type sex,  where everything seems like a good idea at the time.  At the time.  And then you both hopefully reach your orgasms.  Oh.  And then it's cleanup time.  Cleanup time.  And then you look around the room and realize how silly the whole thing was.  Put those away now. 
[00:39:30]  Put those vibrators in the vibrator drawer.  You have to put the strap-on dildo in the dishwasher.  Dildo.  Dildo in the dishwasher.  You shave each other's pubes, and you're finding pubes in your bed for the next week and a half.  Yeah, let's get the razor.  Yeah, look, you're all shaved, and I'm all shaved.  Then for two weeks later, you're scratching like you got the mange. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, you can't even walk.  You're all rash.  How awful is that?  Yeah, that was a great idea.  As you're itching away.  I shaved my pubes one time when I was 15 because my buddy did.  He's like, dude, just try it.  So I tried it.  I was whacking my bag with a cloth on me for two weeks.  It was awful.  Yeah, it hurts.  It's like needles.  You get to a point where it's not hair. 
[00:40:30]  There are quills growing out of your pubis.  They're just stabbing your dick.  That's if you got that Italian hair, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  I still got a little wisp.  I don't know.  Thank God.  If you're shaved, though, and it's just growing in, I'm talking like, you know, you can't  even measure it growing in.  They're like quills.  It hurts.  You're trying to walk, and your sack is like a Brillo pad between your legs. 
[00:41:00]  It hurts your thighs.  You can't walk right.  You go to take a leak, and you feel all silly.  It's like a constant reminder.  Oh, what did I do?  You look like you're eight years old.  Oh, don't do it.  Please, God, don't let me have an accident for a month.  I don't want to be in the hospital like this.  The silliness of sex.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[00:41:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Boy.  Well, let me see what they're saying.  Oh, I've got to put everything on hold while you do.  No, let's keep talking.  First of all, let me see.  Hello, Rich.  What's going on? 
[00:42:00]  You know what you guys are like?  Why?  You're like an ex-girlfriend.  You're following me, and you're stalking me, okay?  Dude, you left us for a fat chick.  You know that, right?  No, first of all.  A fat chick that has a smelly vagina.  We're always saying nice things on the radio about ONA.  That's all we say.  There's good things about ONA, but yet you've got to track me down.  Did you get me when I was funny, though?  We got you mispronouncing a lot of words.  You were definitely funny.  Yep. 
[00:42:30]  We've got to be honest.  You were very funny, but you were butchering the English language.  Can we tie this in so I don't have to talk through my phone?  A beep booth.  Yeah, what's a beep booth?  I didn't say a beep booth.  I said a peep booth.  No, you didn't say a beep booth.  You said a pee booth.  I've got to go.  Hey, hold on.  Where are you going?  No, I'm not going.  Here, talk, talk.  I'll talk to them.  All right, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Now I just walked out of his studio, you jackasses.  We got you thrown off the show.  Were you supposed to do his show all morning? 
[00:43:00]  No, I've got to go from here to Baltimore.  I don't know.  I'm at the improv.  Dude, here's the deal.  We were listening in on you.  You were definitely killing and mispronouncing like you do.  That's fine, you know?  Yeah.  But, I mean, Elliot is not a bad guy, and he's been cool to Anthony and I over the years.  But, man, he has a really weird laugh while you're trying to do material.  Well, what am I supposed to do about it?  He's letting me smoke cigarettes in the studio.  Yeah.  All right?  I'm kind of controlling running the show.  You know, it's pretty much for his loss.  Because, like, when I go into these places, you know, it's big for them to get someone 
[00:43:30]  like me.  They don't understand.  They don't understand.  You know, they really think I've got stuff going on still.  Really?  You got him bamboozled.  Did you hear our...  Did you see your phone ringing during the interview?  No, it was in my pocket, thank God.  Was it vibrating?  I couldn't feel it.  It did.  I'm below the waist.  DC 101.  That's...  What kind of show is it? 
[00:44:00]  I guess it's Elliot, right?  He's doing pretty much a talk show now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's a talk show.  Yeah.  And what's up with the woman?  She has nothing.  She's nice.  They're all nice.  But then I go to Baltimore and do something.  I think the mix or something.  Uh-huh.  What are you doing in Baltimore?  I just said the mix.  Don't yell at me.  Wait, hold on.  I'm going to burn this bridge right now.  What?  Hold on.  Let's go.  I'll be back in.  Listen, they pay the bills.  Hold on. 
[00:44:30]  Let's make him be late.  You know what?  You guys...  So, Rich, what's going on?  Like, they want you back on the air?  Yeah, I'm going back on the air.  You owe me three appearances.  Where are you going to be?  Yeah, where are you going to...  I'll be Baltimore in Providence at Caroline's next week.  Can you hear me still?  How's Bonnie?  Bonnie's great, Bonnie.  Rich?  Rich.  Rich?  Can someone call back in with that show?  Yeah, now we've got to hear what's going on.  We've got to hear what Dumbbell is doing.  Idiot. 
[00:45:00]  He knew what we were doing, though.  That lummox.  That lummox.  Yeah, he was on to us.  Bastard.  Damn it.  I want to get him to curse on regular radio.  Get him to feel comfortable like he does here.  Yeah, that would be a good idea.  Or using foul language.  Where's that guy, man?  He's got to call back with the show for us.  All right, you want to...  As we...  We'll stall for a second here.  So the post has a little funny thing they're doing with the Rolling Stones here, Anthony.  They're just full of comedians over there. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, they try their hand at comedy from time to time instead of reporting the news.  They do everything but report the news at this point.  Come on, where is he?  I know, we're looking at the phone bank all distracted now.  All right, this one might have it.  You think?  Yeah, come on.  Just put...  Throw John on.  Yeah.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Well, they probably want to test it out.  Yeah, got it.  My phone's going to crap out.  Get somebody else to do it. 
[00:46:00]  No, go ahead.  Put it down there.  All right.  Keep you to the video.  The best of Hollywood Entertainment now playing.  An equal opportunity employer.  Commercials?  How was that?  It's good.  Shut up.  It's good.  We'll try to get someone else.  So just, you know, help us out until we find somebody else.  All right.  C-E-S-U-R-A-N-C-D dot com.  They've streamlined insurance buying, and that could save you time and money.  Affordable.  That's A-F-S-O-I-G-A-B-L-E. 
[00:46:30]  Stupid commercials.  I thought they were going back.  Like, Rich, you got all freaked out and had to run back in there.  He was lying.  It's that simple.  Insurance.com also lets you see other companies.  All right.  Well, we're waiting here.  What about, no, Jamie didn't have it?  Oh, come on.  S-O-M-Z.  That's incorrect, sir.  Yeah, whatever you say, kid.  This guy, Chris, might have it.  That guy's phone's dying.  Is it?  Let's try Chris. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Chris.  Yeah.  All right.  Help us out here.  Put it down there.  Yeah, you're on a commercial right now, but I'll give it to you.  Okay.  So anyway, the New York Post, Anthony, I guess we could try to do our own radio show.  Well, let me hear his.  That stinks.  Yeah, you're talking about the traffic.  Yeah, well, Chris, put it down there so we can hear what it'll sound like.  Gotcha.  With traffic on DC 101.  Oh, perfect.  As an American, you have certain...  Does that work for you? 
[00:47:30]  The way you just had it was perfect.  Yeah, that'll be perfect when we're ready.  All right.  Very good.  Chris?  Yep.  No, no, no.  Don't.  Don't fuck with me, Jimmy.  Are they going back to the show?  No, it's the talking about car ads.  You guys want to buy a car?  No, no, not particularly.  All right, so the New York Post is trying to be funny with the whole Stones going on tour thing, Anthony.  And there's a big thing in the New York Post that says the Stones are back with all new songs. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  And they now list all the new songs that the Stones are going to perform.  Put on your laughing hats.  Wait, let me finish.  Oh, Jimmy's yogurt.  Your plastic is louder.  All right.  Here are all the new songs for the new tour with the Rolling Stones.  Wait.  Okay.  I haven't done it yet, though.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Time isn't on my side. 
[00:48:30]  Can't get no free prescription drugs.  It's awful.  It certainly is.  Pacemaker of Stone.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Gimme Depends.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Under my orthopedic supports.  Eh, eh, eh.  It's only Metamucil, but I like it.  Ah, that's a good one.  That's funny.  Alzheimer Fighting Man.  Uh-oh, they're going to get some complaints. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, guys, they're coming back.  Oh, oh, let's listen.  Just in time.  Well, there's the post.  Try to be funny.  Yeah.  Oh, nuestros.  Mr. Gil.  That's what you waste your time on?  Are you on here?  Yeah, now we're back.  Mr. Gil.  We're on here, not in there.  No, I don't.  Dr. Gil, I don't watch these reality shows, but Bonnie does, only because he wants to see 
[00:49:30]  what works for our show, you know.  So you go with Puffy's TV, Man 3?  We watch a little bit.  Call his phone again.  Call his phone again.  He might have moved around in his pocket.  He might have left it on the console or something.  I watch him dance and sing and get thrown out of the house like most girls do.  No.  All right, he didn't sing well enough for me.  Get out.  Next.  All right, hold on. 
[00:50:00]  I've got to get a winner.  Where am I going, Kyle?  Line 1.  Hi, early in the morning.  Whoa.  Hey.  Who's that?  Oh, I'm Lindsay.  Say hi to Mr. Rich Voss, please.  Hi, Mr. Nick Voss.  Hi, how you going?  Put your phone away.  How you doing?  What's your name?  I'm Lindsay.  Hi, Lindsay.  How's it going?  I'm doing very well now.  I've never made it.  Call him again.  What do you say?  He goes, put your phone away.  Take it for you.  We'll see you Saturday afternoon for cook-off.  All right.  Just keep calling.  Hold tight once.  Everyone's calling. 
[00:50:30]  We've got four people calling.  I'm trying to remember where we left off.  Oh, you know what?  Talk to me about Jay Moore.  Do you still talk to him?  I haven't talked to him in, uh, you're going to say since the show?  Well, maybe one time since then I think I talked to him.  Is that right?  Really?  Yeah.  Did you guys have a falling out?  No, I never really hung out with him.  I thought you were tight with him.  No, I was friends with him, but not just the kind of friends.  Like, if we saw each other somewhere, we would talk or whatever.  I didn't want to call him about egg whites.  You know, we would meet up and hang out or anything, you know. 
[00:51:00]  But you didn't have a falling out?  Because, like, Kathleen Madigan said she had a falling out with him.  Kathleen Madigan said she had a falling out with everybody.  See, I like her, though.  Really?  Well, yeah.  I want egg whites.  Well, I mean, I have nothing against her either.  You know, but I can see.  Hey, Rich, it's me.  Just calling to say hello.  See what you're doing.  I'm hanging out, man.  Just a little bit of a shit.  I haven't talked to you in a while.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you soon.  Please.  She couldn't.  I remember watching her as a kid.  I remember when Ed Sullivan brought her out. 
[00:51:30]  You know, what's this next comic?  Kathleen Madigan.  You're not going to want to bang her.  Poor listeners.  I thought they were done with this.  I don't know which one I was.  You know, someone has a great idea.  Leave some psycho ex-girlfriend type of message for Buzz.  You know, on that TV show, she came along as Mrs. Personality.  Right.  You know, when we were doing the movie, you know, I think I said something funny about her.  Yeah.  Just keep it in the background, maybe?  I don't know.  It's a little distracting.  I thought that comic was going to help you. 
[00:52:00]  Huh?  Please.  You know, Ed, it's so funny because how Bonnie was thrown under the bus on second.  Right.  And how they, I mean, they really made her trash her and made her look bad.  But she's the one that did the HBO special.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, you know, I'm sure they're all, you know, a little pissed off Alonzo.  He's got to push his fiancee everywhere he goes.  He's the one that got the HBO special.  He was good during the roast.  Yeah.  He always thinks about this.  This is going on right now. 
[00:52:30]  And then they're not even going to acknowledge this.  Are you insane?  Know how many of our listeners are calling right now trying to get through?  Trying to get through.  Trying to get through.  I'm going to look for some fun radio for everybody, and they're going to make believe this isn't  going on.  Nope.  Second season, they stunk in air.  They obviously talked about it during the commercial.  Let's see if one of our listeners is true.  I'm going to drink Norton's blood.  He's making fun of your blood.  I don't know.  I don't know Kathleen like that.  Right.  She could be funny.  I'm sure, you know, she has a following.  Margaret Cho does.  They all get a following. 
[00:53:00]  You know, they all can fill with theater here.  I work A-clubs.  No, A-club.  You know, I mean, how's your buddy Mordell?  Mordell's.  I'm working with him next week at the Carolines.  Are you right?  Being involved.  You're some nervous idiot who knows we're listening in.  You need Mordell and Corey.  All flustered.  We've got a loose casino.  You know, I'm going to bring the one I'm bagging.  I'm not going to bring the one that, you know, is old and has, you know, another kid.  I'm not going to bring her on the road for me for.  You know, listen to me.  I've been too broad and, you know, nagging me all day.  Shut up, stupid. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  I've got a hot one at least now.  All right.  Okay.  So, Bonnie, you know, she told me she had 40 minutes.  She lied, but that's okay.  What?  Who, Bonnie?  Yeah.  No.  Are you kidding me?  Please.  It's like a nickel down there.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like a nickel.  I'm surprised enough.  So, here's the deal.  Yeah, Mordell's doing okay.  He's a miserable loser, too.  I surround myself with losers. 
[00:54:00]  You know.  All right.  We'll check in on that in a second, because now we've got to go to Donald in Detroit.  Donald, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Our buddy Imus is on the case for you guys again this morning.  Okay.  Yeah, we talked about this about a half hour ago.  You want to hear what his latest thing is now?  This is our Play Other People's Radio Shows segment of the show.  Yeah, why not?  Hey, we've still got three hours of radio to do.  Really?  We've only taken a three-minute break so far, so we're still ahead of the game, kind of.  Don't worry about it.  All right, go ahead, Donald.  This is about from 7.10 this morning, Eastern Time. 
[00:54:30]  Here we go.  All right.  Let me just say this to the people at NBC News.  Are you happy you have us on your channel now?  Don't they have to think, by the way?  Hey, by the way, Sid, where's my Opie and Anthony t-shirt?  You know, I'm going to kill Opie.  I spoke to Rick Delgado yesterday, the former producer.  I try to get the Opie.  I can't get him for you.  I'm trying, though.  I will get him at some point.  What are they doing?  I mean, what is Opie doing that he can't send me a t-shirt? 
[00:55:00]  Jerk.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  We'll get him, I promise.  The Opie will not be disappointed.  It doesn't matter what year.  I want one from the shuttle I do.  Well, whatever they have.  We'll get it for you.  Don't worry, Opie.  Get that.  Come on, man.  Who was there when you guys were down?  Yeah, absolutely.  The Opie was right there.  Don't forget.  Oh, my God.  There's that disturbing photo.  For our radio audience, I don't even know how to describe this. 
[00:55:30]  A picture of Opie and Ima.  It looks like Opie in London reading to Camilla Parker.  Is that Bernie?  They're on the pursuit of a gay batter.  No doubt.  Anyway, back to the Opie.  All right, guys.  All right.  Donald, you rock.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  He's a funny bastard, Bernie.  Bernie's one of the funniest out there.  He really is one of the funniest.  Back to Voss on D.C. 101 in Washington.  You sit here for an hour and you'll have plucks.  Hold on.  What's going on over in Minnesota?  Rob, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wanting to let you guys know up here in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the radio station  played a bit of your butt plugs part there that you guys played the other day.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, they used it.  They were talking to some guy that calls in from time to time about talking about local movies and stuff.  Yeah.  And the guy made a comment and then the local DJ here played your butt plugs bit just for a quick second there.  And I caught it.  And I just remember hearing it the other day on your station because I listened to you guys all night long.  Yeah.  Radio guys all over America have been playing stuff off that CD that we put out a few years back.  Hoo-hoo.  It's amazing because, I mean, the radio station up here does excellent bits. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, they do really good bits.  They're a great radio station, but I couldn't believe they played something off your station because it just rocks.  All right.  Well, thanks, Rob.  Thank you.  Okay.  I guess we're done with D.C. 101 as well.  That was fun, though.  Yeah, some of the listeners are getting very annoyed.  Are they really?  Yeah.  I think it's kind of interesting, though.  Yeah, but they don't see it like that.  Why?  A couple of them.  30 minutes is too long on this shit.  It wasn't 30 minutes, was it?  This guy's saying. 
[00:57:30]  It only felt like it.  Yeah, that's true.  Would you lazy fucks do a show and stop listening to this midget mush mouth bombing on another show?  Well, we have ADD.  We, you know.  We'll try to focus.  Come on, guys.  Vos is not funny on your show.  He's even more not funny on someone else's show.  Nah, I mean, you've got to defend Vos. 
[00:58:00]  He's a funny guy.  True.  All right.  You know what?  Why don't we take another break, then?  A quick break.  We'll regroup, and we'll start our show.  All right.  In just a few minutes.  This channel is experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  We're working on the problem.  Technical difficulties.  Probably just faulty equipment.  Or Ben's hog hit the circuit breaker and tripped it.  Steve poured a martini in the mixing board.  Or Hulk's breath burnt through the transmission cord.  Sandy Kane blocked the sky with Twado. 
[00:58:30]  Or Bob Kelly vomited all over the console.  Or Howard Stern bought XM for half a billion.  Or Pat from Runaki drove his van through the building.  What's the meaning?  The scene three messages are repeating.  The only way to fix it is a corporate meeting.  And Opie's not around.  He's rollerblading in the park.  And Professor Anthony can't even get it to start.  It's taking forever.  I hope it don't last long.  Like Stalker Patty crawling with a crusty mask on.  Or maybe Danny told Ricky to stop the show.  Or Opie threw a chocolate strawberry at ELO.  The show. 
[00:59:00]  This is the calling of the rest of our lives.  On Holidays.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Believe it or not.  Yeah.  Sounded like someone else's program there for a while.  But I still say that was fun. 
[00:59:30]  That was a lot of fun to do.  Like goofing around like that.  Why not?  Anthony, we were going to talk about the big story.  Yesterday, the Capitol building was evacuated.  As was the White House.  As well as the White House, right?  Because of these two airheads.  Opie, scenes of pandemonium in Washington.  Oh, did you show the guy getting shot again?  No.  Scenes of pandemonium in Washington evacuating the Capitol.  The White House.  All you saw was a bunch of people running down the streets with cops telling him to run, run. 
[01:00:00]  And it was just a pilot and a student pilot flying to an air show.  It was just two dopes.  Two dopes and a little Cessna cruising around.  That had no idea what was going on below them.  You would think you would know if you're in the most restricted airspace in the country.  It's the most restricted airspace over Washington, D.C.  And you would think you would know.  But no.  These guys flew right into it, right into the no-fly zone. 
[01:00:30]  And they went to what level?  Threat level yellow at the White House.  Then they went to orange and then red.  It got up to threat level red.  Red doesn't sound good.  Red is there is an imminent threat.  This is it.  It's going to happen.  And these dopes were navigating by sight, I'm hearing?  Yeah.  VFR.  They probably saw the Capitol building or the White House and said, oh, look at that. 
[01:01:00]  Let's take a closer look.  Let's get a closer look.  A little closer look at the White House.  When's the next time we're going to be this close to the White House?  Like I said, you would think you would know.  But these clowns just flying around.  They scrambled some fighters and helicopters.  And I guess they tried to get the guy's attention and tried to radio him.  But he wouldn't answer.  So that's when they went to threat level red.  And they finally had to fire off flares from the fighter planes to get this guy's attention. 
[01:01:30]  And once they did that, he turned away.  But they were already going through their protocols to shoot this guy out of the sky.  One of the guys said they were about a minute away.  That would have rocked.  From shooting this guy.  This guy was a minute away from just being incinerated by an F-16.  How do you not notice an F-16 buzzing you?  How do you?  You're just cruising around and there's an F-16 trying to get your attention.  He's got to fire flares before you even notice. 
[01:02:00]  You would think just the F-16 would catch your attention.  But no.  A minute away.  Only three miles from the White House, the plane finally turns west after the F-16s launched warning flares.  And that's when they lowered the threat level and the all-clear sounds.  But you saw all the people running.  Yeah.  Did you see all the people with their little name tags?  Yeah.  Running down the street?  I saw a lot of people running without their shoes on. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Here's a lady.  Well, she's got her shoes in her hands.  That's what I mean.  Well, heels make it a little hard to run.  They're getting a little comfortable in the capital.  A little comfy.  In the capital.  Maybe you should be wearing sneakers all the time when you live in these high-threat zones so you can just run.  You look a little silly holding your heels and running in your stockings.  Doing that not fast enough to run away from a bomb run.  I'd be wearing Nikes every day.  Yeah.  They're showing real out-of-shape old, like, political dudes in their suits trying to run away. 
[01:03:00]  They'd all be doomed.  Just stop it.  Where are they running?  Outside of the capital.  To a cherry blossom tree.  There you go.  We've got under here for a while.  We have some clips.  Ooh.  We have a clip from the neighbor of this dope.  I guess they ended up arresting him.  Will there be charges?  How does that work?  They arrested him, questioned him, realized that he was just an idiot.  Meant no harm.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  And let him go.  All right.  Let's go to this first clip here.  He's not the type of person to do something like that.  I mean, probably he's the most law-biting citizen I know.  What is she, on the show we were just listening to?  Is she on the way?  A minute away.  They interview this neighbor.  She's a trip. 
[01:04:00]  Listen to this clip.  The shock.  I mean, it had to be a mistake.  There's just no way it would be anything that he would do deliberately.  Yeah.  All right.  Sherman reports.  Authorities say the pilot simply lost track of his location.  Go to track five.  Let's try track five.  According to federal authorities, the men on the plane were Hayden Schaefer and a student  pilot named Troy Martin, both of Pennsylvania. 
[01:04:30]  Ah.  There you go.  Student.  Maybe the student was at the wheel.  A lot of times these instructors take the students up, and the students do all the flying.  Right.  You know, the instructor doesn't really pay much attention.  And perhaps he wanted a closer look at the White House.  All right.  Well, Leno and Letterman had a lot of fun with this last night.  Hey, did you hear about the...  We got a couple of their jokes for everybody this morning.  Do you know where it is there, Eric?  We're working on a new system here, so just bear with us. 
[01:05:00]  Here's Leno.  You got Leno?  Hit that.  The White House and the Capitol building were evacuated when a small plane flew into restricted  airspace.  You hear about this?  You hear about this?  Actually got within three miles of the White House.  Three miles!  That's closer than John Kerry ever got.  Three miles!  That's pretty funny.  I'll give him that one.  Very nice.  I think he had one more joke last night about it.  During the scare, Vice President Cheney was working in the West Wing, and President Bush  was outside riding his bicycle. 
[01:05:30]  So it's a typical day at the White House, really.  Pretty good.  Yeah, you know, I was talking to Anthony about that picture they have in the paper.  They show the president, I guess, coming back to the White House from biking.  He was bicycling in Maryland.  And he also had a book in his hand.  And I'm thinking, I don't want to see a picture like that of my president.  Why?  He shouldn't be able to be biking and reading.  He probably stops, gets off the bike, reads a little.  He shouldn't be allowed to eat or sleep. 
[01:06:00]  No.  You're the president of the United States of America.  I don't want to be sitting around thinking that you're off biking.  You're off reading the Da Vinci Code, you know?  Dick Cheney was on the job.  It's all right.  They switch back and forth.  But how does he have time to do all this stuff when he's trying to run the free world, Anthony?  I don't know.  You would think he would be busy 24 hours a day.  You think Abe Lincoln got some exercise in?  He vacations more than any other president.  He's just going through the motions, I think. 
[01:06:30]  He does a few things for photo ops,  and then most of the time he's biking or vacationing or cutting wood.  Or reading.  They do.  They take their hatchet out and cut wood to look manly.  So you're trying to tell me that his job isn't that important these days?  No.  It's not that important at all.  I don't know what he does, to tell you the truth.  All right.  Let's go to Letterman and see what he did with this whole thing last night.  You ever see on South Park, what's his name, Jimmy?  Jimmy.  Little Jimmy is a comic.  And he does that.  You hear about the plane flying into the White House? 
[01:07:00]  Did you hear about this?  He always adds that in.  Anyone hear about this?  All right.  Let's go to the Letterman clip.  What was it?  It was a lobbyist airlifting bribe money to Tom DeLay.  Oh, wow.  Leno.  Leno.  Letterman zero. 
[01:07:30]  Well, let's give Letterman one more shot here.  But there hasn't been such a panicked evacuation of the White House since Hillary walked in on Bill.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  He had to go with a Clinton joke.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Someone looks stupid this morning.  Wow.  That's no-brainer material for guys like them. 
[01:08:00]  That really didn't go well.  Wow.  Jimmy?  Like I always say.  Big fan.  Leno is a better comic.  Yeah.  By far.  By far.  All right.  Let's go to Georgia.  Ed, what's up?  The hell's the leader of the free world doing bicycling or reading a book in the middle of  the day?  I want that job, man.  I'm fucking my ass.  He didn't think he could when he switched pads.  But then he got the right ones.  And as this joke is bombing, I kind of realized that I should just shut up instead of trying 
[01:08:30]  to fix it.  White shorts?  He's wearing white shorts.  He's probably doing stuff like this almost every day, but he finally got caught because  now they need a picture of the president with this crisis going on.  And there they show him stepping out of a vehicle in his biking attire and holding a book.  He's keeping in shape.  The leader of the free fucking world in his bicycle pants.  Well, actually, the reason he rode his bike is because they set the lemonade stand up a 
[01:09:00]  little too far to walk.  Get it?  Yeah, we get it.  Let's go to the jersey.  Joe, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  All right, Joe.  I can understand how these guys got lost.  It's not like there's any landmarks above Washington, D.C.  Punching out.  All right.  No, I think they got all excited out there.  You know, you're flying.  You see these things like, whoa, let's get close.  Let's check it out.  You know, I would assume you would know exactly where you are, even from landmarks on the ground.  That's what they call flying by the seat of your pants. 
[01:09:30]  That's it.  You get out there and you look out your window on a clear day and you can tell where you  are.  Right.  They got the aviation maps there.  It actually has ground landmarks on the maps so you know where you are.  The White House is supposedly hard to find from the air, harder than you'd think because  of the trees or whatever.  I heard on the 11th they were actually looking for the White House.  Really?  Yeah.  Couldn't find it.  Let's go to Jay in Minnesota.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Jay? 
[01:10:00]  How much?  I could see how that could happen.  I know those guys probably shit their pants.  But eight or nine years ago, I'm a private pilot myself and I have instrument flight rating.  But when I was working on the line of sight or the VFR, as they call it, if you're not  too familiar with your landmarks like I wasn't and you fly over a military base where it's  restricted, yeah, they get a little uppity.  A little uppity.  What happened to you?  Oh, well, see, this particular one, there's a river bank that kind of runs parallel to 
[01:10:30]  it and they were making high-speed runs through this river valley.  And, yeah, they kind of paid attention to me a little bit and this voice came across  the radio that said, land your plane immediately.  So, of course, I did, not knowing what was going to happen.  And the pucker factor was definitely a 10 as I got on the ground.  And I had a little visit from the FAA.  I guarantee these guys may not have had charges pressed against them, but their licenses will 
[01:11:00]  be yanked because they'll get time.  Really?  Oh, sure, because they'll get a letter from the FRA, or not the FRA, the FAA.  I work for the railroad, so I deal with these FRA clowns.  Oh, the FAA.  But the FAA will send a nice little letter that'll say, yeah, we're going to yank your  license for a while until you pull your head out of your fucking ass.  And if they do it again, they'll never get another pilot's license in their life.  Yeah, they don't give you many mistakes with your pilot's license.  No, in my particular case, it was just sort of a, you know what you did? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, I did something bad.  Right.  And they said, okay, well, give us your license back.  And it took me almost three years to get it back.  Wow.  Yeah, and the thing is, you know, you're looking on the maps, and depending on your  instrumentation, if you don't have, if you're doing like a non-precision approach where you're  just kind of out looking at the white, puffy clouds, and you're not paying attention to  where you're going, it happens real fast.  And it was like, I don't know, not even two to three minutes before I, what's that? 
[01:12:00]  No, no, no, what were you saying?  Oxygen is dropping from the ceiling of our studio.  We're breathing it in right now.  We've lost cabin pressure, sir, and we're fading out.  We already lost Payne Stewart, and the rest are going down.  Oh, I tell you, you know what?  Oh, my God, Jay.  Jay, what, what, what?  Go ahead, Jay, what, what, what?  How about the big, the grand finale?  The grand finale was as I looked at the two fucking airplanes, the two F-16s coming towards 
[01:12:30]  me.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, I, I'm a man enough to say I shit my pants.  There you go.  All right, thank you.  So I'll, fuck, 500 miles an hour compared to 200 miles an hour?  Oh, my God.  That's what I'm trying to say.  It's faster, right?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Wait, wait.  Don't make it worse.  Giving him an excuse.  Thank you, Jay.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Eric.  All right, thanks for sharing.  He had no closure.  Oh, now he's mad at us.  Anthony, a lot of instant feedback coming in.  The president is calling it in.  Mr. Squidlow Clark from WhackBag.com with that one. 
[01:13:00]  Dan from Hoboken.  There hasn't been this much panic at the White House since Taft had the vapors.  All right.  Our little, our little radio stunt has already made the, uh, the news, Anthony.  dcrtv.com, uh, da, da, da, uh, it doesn't make sense.  Dave, here's a DC, okay, Dave, here's a DC 101 XM tie-in for you this morning.  Around 7.45 this morning, Opie and Anthony featured their friend comedian Rich Voss on 
[01:13:30]  DC 101's Elliot in the Morning show.  They did their normal trick of having a local listener hold their phone up to the radio.  Uh, they've done this in a bunch of cities in a play other people's radio shows bit.  O and A listened in live to about 15 minutes of Elliot's show, calling Rich Voss on his  cell phone during the Elliot, uh, commercial breaks.  It made for some good radio.  O and A listeners were trying to get through Elliot's phone screener, but to no avail.  There you go.  And it was only 15 minutes.  It seemed longer.  See? 
[01:14:00]  Only 15 minutes.  Relax.  Let's go to Tom in DC.  Tom, what's up?  Well, hey, O and A, I was just calling to let y'all know, if that had been a serious  situation yesterday, I'd have been shit out of luck, because I was listening to y'all  replays all day.  I didn't know anything was going on until about 6.30 yesterday evening.  Really?  Well, I guess it was a big deal down there, so.  Yeah, it was a pretty big deal, but there was no traffic or nothing.  I drive, I work for Verizon.  I'm riding around all day.  Yeah.  I didn't see any traffic or anything. 
[01:14:30]  All I know is when I got home, it's all over the news, and I didn't know, because I  got my XM on all day.  Well, as soon as I heard about it, my first thought was that Lee Abrams was flying the  XM plane high and lost his way a little bit.  Think of the publicity.  Imagine the news shot, the plane on the runway with XM on it.  Yeah.  See?  They don't know how to get press, XM.  All right.  Send Lee to fly around with XM graphics on the plane.  Send him to fly over to the White House. 
[01:15:00]  They'll make him land.  They'll be the helicopter shot of the runway and the plane.  They'll get out with pot smoke pouring out of the plane.  Like fast times when they open the van door.  We're doing the radio, what FM did to AM.  He's a couple of them beating with a hammer.  That's explaining how you shouldn't have your sweepers sound like the old sweepers.  The gang down at the compound in Washington, the XM compound, they're passing around an email  of a picture of Lee Abrams in his plane, looking like just an animal, looking psychotic as hell. 
[01:15:30]  High and psychotic.  That is the only, I can only imagine Mohammed Atta making the same face.  Looks like Wilford Brimley flying an aircraft.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  Let me tell you about my diabetes.  All right, so that was the big story, Anthony.  There you go.  And then the other big story, I guess, Macaulay Culkin, I don't know.  Testified in the Jacko trial.  Yeah, New York Post headline.  Maco and Jacko. 
[01:16:00]  Maco.  Oh, Maco and Jacko.  How does he look 40 already?  His awful hairline.  Jesus Christ.  He's 18.  Macaulay Culkin.  How old is he?  He's young.  He's like 20, whatever he is.  He's young.  He's about 22, 23 at this point.  He can run through the mill.  Did you see photos of him, though?  They were showing a clip from Home Alone where he's shirtless in front of the mirror.  Whoa.  Suddenly understand.  That's going to be hard to resist.  And now he looks like Jim Brewer in this picture.  Yeah.  Does he look like Brewer?  Oh, definitely.  And Macaulay Culkin also won't be appearing on our program.  Yes. 
[01:16:30]  Well, Macaulay Culkin, he testified and he had nothing.  He said that Michael Jackson never, never touched him, even though there were all these  allegations that the prosecution was making that Michael Jackson had molested Macaulay Culkin.  He came out right there on the stand and said, no, that never happened.  The prosecution, no one from the prosecution ever contacted me and asked me if these were  true or not.  They just went around and said, yeah, he was molested.  So the defense brought him up and he has said no.  Although he did say that at one point when he was a real little kid that Michael Jackson 
[01:17:00]  invited him back in 91, invited him himself on a trip to Bermuda with Macaulay's family  and bought him a Rolex, which is a little odd for a little child.  You buy him a Rolex and invite yourself along with the family on a trip.  You've got to think if Macaulay Culkin was touched, he's not going to admit it.  That's embarrassing.  That's going to let's go.  That is pretty embarrassing.  It's so embarrassing it's going to ruin it as far as him and girls go.  Yeah.  You don't want to admit that ever. 
[01:17:30]  You don't want to be another Michael Jackson victim.  Well, he gave him a Rolex because they keep the best time and he wanted to be accurate.  He said, look, I want you to get in here and suck my cock at 743.  I'm the dot, boy.  Take this watch.  Here with you.  Look, he's good time.  All right.  Let's go to some of these Michael Jackson clips.  This is such a waste.  He's going to walk.  There's no doubt about it now.  There's no doubt about it now.  The prosecution's been done with the case now for a while.  It's all the defense that's bringing up the witnesses. 
[01:18:00]  And then they'll do their closing arguments.  But the prosecution's done with their case and they had nothing.  They had nothing.  They had the family that's at the center of this whole thing with such contradictory testimony, previous lies that came up.  They're not credible at all.  And no one else to back this up that had any credibility.  Now the defense is up there pretty much dispelling everything that the prosecution's done.  Was there any DNA evidence?  Nothing.  No.  Just like a fingerprint maybe on it? 
[01:18:30]  Fingerprints on some porn magazines and stuff like that.  But that doesn't really prove anything.  It could be in his house.  Because kids were in his house.  But, you know, as a kid, if you see a Playboy or some porno laying around, you pick it up.  It doesn't necessarily mean the adult in the house is showing it to you.  You know, if I was in a house and I found a stash of Playboys, you're damn right I'm looking at it.  It doesn't mean the adult there wants the kids looking at it.  So that really was nothing.  And he's definitely walking.  I once looked at a Glamour magazine because it was, you know, in the bathroom. 
[01:19:00]  Cosmo, dude.  Cosmo.  My mother used to subscribe to Cosmopolitan magazine.  Hot.  Every month a new one would come.  And there was a section in the back called Cosmo Tells All.  And it was guaranteed always a nude picture of a girl.  And that was, might as well have been Hustler back then.  All right.  Why don't we go to some of this audio, Derek?  Ooh, what do we got?  Yeah, you can hit it.  What?  Ah!  That was audio from Michael Jackson's bedroom. 
[01:19:30]  That was some of the hidden microphones in his room.  Can we hear that again?  I didn't realize you were going to that exclusive clip.  Here's audio from Michael Jackson's bedroom, Anthony, while Macaulay Calkin was visiting.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  So I'm not really sure what was going on in that clip, but you've got to assume it's 
[01:20:00]  not good.  Well, it could just be maybe Macaulay was reenacting the scene from Home Alone, where he smacks his  cheeks with his hands and kind of makes a little scream, but he got a little carried  away.  All right.  Let's hear that one more time.  Ah!  What the hell is that from?  But he said yesterday that nothing happened.  Right.  Nothing happened. 
[01:20:30]  So obviously that's something else there, Anthony.  All right.  Let's go to another clip here from the Michael Jackson case.  Michael Jackson's been able to explain to the jury why he spends so much time with children,  and he did so without having to actually testify or undergo cross-examination.  The jury has seen about two hours of footage shot at the same time as the 2003 documentary  that hurt Jackson's reputation.  In this footage, Jackson says he's inspired by the purity and innocence of children and  believes people should be not childish, but more childlike. 
[01:21:00]  Brian Bland at the courthouse, Santa Maria, California.  Brian Bland says it all.  Yep.  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  Back to you, Dan Dullard.  But they can't prove anything.  That's the amazing thing about this.  No.  No.  And what he's saying doesn't...  They want to catch him so bad, and they just can't do it.  What he's saying doesn't exonerate him, that Michael Jackson just sees this innocence in  children that he likes being around.  That's any pedophile. 
[01:21:30]  Sure.  That's what any pedophile says.  Oh, it's not about that or the sex or anything.  I just love children.  Yeah, well, yeah.  You're not supposed to.  You're not supposed to be in your bedroom.  So, the guy's guilty of sin, but he won't go away.  Does anybody else notice this is another inept job by the prosecutors in California?  They have done nothing but blow case after major case after major case.  They blow every major case they get their hands on. 
[01:22:00]  Isn't it just amazing?  O.J.  O.J.  Robert Blake.  Robert Blake.  Reginald Denny, I think they got the conviction on those guys, if not for the video and the  tap dancing after the toilet got smashed into the head.  You got to dance after you do that move, though.  Rodney King, of course you do.  You got to dance.  You bash a white man's head with a toilet, you might as well just do a two-step dance.  Little men without hats playing in the background.  Bob in New York, what's up?  Bob's broken leg in New York. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, who's Macaulay Culkin?  Oh, yeah, Macaulay Culkin.  Culkin, sorry.  Macaulay Culkin.  Macaulay Culkin.  They call him Macaulay Culkin, because after Michael Jackson happened, he had caulk all  over his mouth.  Culkin.  Macaulay Culkin.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry.  It happens.  Yeah, I didn't even notice that one.  We're going to have to play our caulk bit.  Caulk.  You want a caulk?  All right.  You want a caulk?  That just reminded me of something.  Anthony, we have another clip of exclusive audio from Michael Jackson's bedroom when Macaulay 
[01:23:00]  Culkin.  Are these available to the court?  Because I think these would be pretty damning.  Well, we're going to FedEx them to the courthouse immediately.  Oh, good.  But some more hidden audio in Michael Jackson's bedroom.  Right.  You better come out and pound me.  Ah!  Wow.  After hearing that clip, I think the guy's guilty, huh? 
[01:23:30]  Now there could be a problem for Wacko Jacko.  Sounds like they were playing a little hide-and-seek.  Let's hear that again there, Dirk.  You better come out and pound me.  Ah!  That screams great.  Wow.  All right.  Um, somebody's saying they got Scott Peterson, though, out there, California.  Uh, yeah.  The Menendez brothers. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  That's my answer to Scott Peterson.  Now, they originally had to go through two trials.  Yeah, two trials.  But, yeah, they finally got them.  They finally got them.  I mean, I could have got them.  Obviously, the biggest blunder was OJ, because that was very, just plain, cut, and clear.  He did it.  And then, uh, Robert Blake, also.  Robert Blake absolutely shot his wife.  Absolutely.  The Rodney King beatings, those cops, that was a major one, too, because they had video of it.  Uh-huh.  And they never called Rodney King to testify and explain. 
[01:24:30]  So the defense presents this brilliant argument.  They slow it down, and they say, this is why he's hitting him here.  He's telling him to stop, and he won't.  Uh-huh.  So they give this great explanation, and the dumb prosecutors never call Rodney King,  so he can go, no, no, no, that's not what was happening.  Uh-huh.  So all the jury hears are these cops explaining away every single blow, and no, uh...  I think justice was served in that case.  I mean, on an emotional level.  I think the cops were doing their job.  They could have cupped him.  Beating down a criminal. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, he was a creep.  And, uh, you know, you've got to give the cops a little attitude.  I completely agree.  But 50 smacks to the guy, they should...  Look, the bottom line is this.  If you're going to do something like that in a video camera's rolling, I'm sorry, it happens.  It was at the beginning of the whole video camera thing, too.  I'm sure the cops didn't really realize there was going to be a camera around.  That stinks.  Imagine the beatings that went on before video.  Oh, God.  If they hit him two or three times, and I mean smashed him and then cuffed him, all right,  that's what happens when you leave him on a chase.  You're going to get your...  Lay down and shut up.  Exactly. 
[01:25:30]  And when they pull you over, pull over.  Don't get him chasing you.  That's what the guy was doing.  They were chasing him.  And when you finally do get pulled over after a chase, or you stop your car, or you crash  or something, give up.  That's it.  Don't try to get up and fight the guys, or you're going to get a beating.  That's it.  You didn't know what he was doing, though.  He was on all those drugs, Anthony.  Well, that seems to be a mistake he made.  He shouldn't have been on the drugs.  And he was paying the consequences.  There you go. 
[01:26:00]  I'm all for giving the cops a little latitude for tuning people up.  I have to.  That's it.  That was what I felt like.  That was just like, ah.  That was cool.  Because you know something?  I know damn well it ain't going to be me.  I agree.  I know damn well it's not, because when I get involved with the police in any way, it's  very respectful, very nice.  Let's take care of this and move on.  But these guys don't have...  It's not...  Why am I getting pulled over?  Listen, motherfucker, I pay your fucking...  You're going to start mouthing off like that, but you've got a problem. 
[01:26:30]  But the difference is, these guys don't have a hit radio show, Anthony.  Where you can just smile at them and go, hey, you know who I am.  I did this shit well before I had a radio show.  And I treat the cops with respect that I have no clue who we are.  And you can tell them right when they get out of the car.  Oh, yeah, you can.  Officer Tyrone Johnson.  Hello, Officer Sanchez.  And you treat them with respect.  I got smashed once, not physically, but one of these guys pulls me over because I decide, 
[01:27:00]  you know, I'm going over train tracks and the gates are coming down.  I'm like, I can't be bothered.  Oh, no.  You're that guy.  Well, there's that point where you know you can make it.  It wasn't anywhere as close.  The lights were starting and you had time.  And it was wide open left to right, so you could even see that the train was nowhere near.  So I guess a lot of people do this.  It's one of those back roads in Greenlawn there or something.  And so I go for it and I'm speeding.  I think we were heading to work or whatever where I was, the old show. 
[01:27:30]  And I go through, right?  Uh-huh.  All of a sudden, whatever.  There it is.  They were waiting for me.  I guess they wait for people all day because everyone does this.  They hide behind one of the buildings right near the train tracks.  And I get pulled over and I'm like, I don't even turn down my radio.  I have my hands in my pockets, basically.  I'm doing everything wrong.  Wrong.  And I'm thinking about you.  I remember this specifically because Anthony gets pulled over a lot. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I do.  I drive like an asshole.  He likes driving on sidewalks and he likes just doing what he has to do to get to work faster.  Illegal passing.  And, you know, we've had these discussions on the air.  So I'm thinking, you know, Anthony just pretty much tells him that he's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  I have never done that any time I'm pulled over.  I have never said I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  You used to hint or something.  There was something going on that always got you out of these tickets.  I know you'd say, sorry, I'm speeding.  Normally my partner Opie is next to me. 
[01:28:30]  There are ways to work in that I am on the radio into a conversation.  Well, basically I'm thinking, because we were really tight back then, especially with the NYPD and all that and the Suffolk County cops and all.  And this guy was right out of our demo.  So he comes walking up to the car.  I'm all cocky and I'm like, do you listen to the radio, sir?  Sir, yeah, I do.  I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:29:00]  So?  His response was so.  Because you put it like that.  And then his license and registration could care less.  You never put it like that, because then that puts him in the position like, oh, this guy's trying to work on me about who he is.  It's got to look like it just naturally came up in conversation.  Hey, your inspection sticker is overdue.  And then you go, hey, have you ever inspected a program called the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:29:30]  Good one.  Well, it gets better.  Slick, slick.  Just slick.  You don't even see it coming.  It gets better, though.  He goes, so, license and registration.  I hand it over, right?  He comes back about ten minutes later.  He gives me a speeding ticket and gives me a ticket for.  Speeding?  Yeah, it was a side road.  I was flying.  And he also gave me a ticket for, you know, going through the gates coming down.  And then goes, by the way, I have heard of the show.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  What a dick.  Yeah, that was his way of just giving it to me.  Well, you presented it to him like something like, look, I'm presenting this to you. 
[01:30:00]  Now you can't give me a ticket.  See, if it's presented that way, looks bad.  Doesn't work.  You got to kind of just let it happen.  So I immediately got on the phone with another one of our friends and had those tickets taken care of the right way.  Did they charge you for littering for an awful name drop?  Pick that up.  And I believe this cop was reprimanded.  Oh, I'll have your job for pulling me over. 
[01:30:30]  A celebrity.  Now, didn't you also get in trouble for doing donuts in a snowy parking lot in a comedy club in Long Island?  Oh, that was after the John Valby show.  With a borrowed Lexus?  Well, yeah.  You got out of that one.  Well, that actually was a lot scarier.  When we were at N.E.W., you know, the Lexus people came to us and gave Anthony and I both a Lexus to drive around for, what, a month or two? 
[01:31:00]  You drove around a lot longer because you just refused to give the car back.  I didn't give it back.  I enjoyed this Lexus a lot.  I had it, and I didn't bring it back.  It was the top-of-the-line Lexus.  This thing on the L.I.E. when you get out east.  Rocket ship.  I had it up to about 120 miles an hour, no joke.  It was a rocket ship.  And I would have went faster, but I was just getting scared at that speed.  You know, call me a wimp, but to me, 120 miles an hour is plenty.  It was great.  I was flying.  And I remember just a little side story. 
[01:31:30]  They gave it to us the weirdest time of year, just when winter was hitting.  Yeah, I know.  And for some reason, my other car was in the shop or there was something wrong with it.  I can't remember now.  But anyway, I did a lot of skiing back then up in Vermont to Killington and stuff, so I took the Lexus.  Good luck.  I took the Lexus.  On dry pavement, you wouldn't find a better car.  But in the snow, they might have gotten better with the Lexus.  Lexuses.  Is it front or rear-wheel drive?  It was front.  It was front-wheel drive, but it was just the tires weren't made for it. 
[01:32:00]  The weight wasn't there.  It was just it slid on anything.  I remember trying to take off, and there was a little snow on the ground from a light.  And it took me about five minutes to get across an intersection.  I couldn't get moving.  I tried feathering the gas just a little bit, and it couldn't move.  It was definitely a warm-weathered car.  It was definitely, you know, you'd have this as your second car if you could afford it.  My other car is a Lexus.  I have a bumper sticker this day.  A lot of laps. 
[01:32:30]  On the Saturn, right?  They'd beep and wave and smile at me.  Funny stuff.  So I'm just thinking this Lexus is going to be perfect to drive up into the mountains of Vermont, go to Killington.  I'm renting, I think it was Christmas vacation, so I'm renting a little condo for the week or a couple days, whatever.  And I couldn't even get up the tiny little incline into the condo area on this thing.  And it almost went off the road, no joke, because it just started sliding.  It was the worst, you know, winter car. 
[01:33:00]  But on dry road, rocket ship.  So I went to John Valby's show, and I think it was the last day I had it, or the last couple days.  I'm like, I'm just going to have some fun with this thing.  Beat on it.  And what's the comedy club out there?  Governors.  Governors, yeah.  With a huge parking lot.  I haven't been there in a while.  They run a really nice club out there.  A huge parking lot.  So I decided to just start ripping around the parking lot and doing donuts and stuff all over the place.  All over the place.  John Valby's watching from his beat-up van in front of the place.  Everyone is laughing.  All the people that were hanging out after the show. 
[01:33:30]  I'm just kind of putting on a show, you know?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, a cop car comes out of nowhere and pulls me over.  Just gives me shit.  I'm thinking, oh, my God.  I might even get arrested.  He's just working me hard.  Hard.  Yep.  And then at the end, lets me off the hook and goes, dude, I'm a huge fan of you guys.  You know, I just happen to be in this parking lot just mellowing out.  I have a break or whatever he was doing.  And I can't believe what I'm seeing.  But then I listened to the show, and I know you guys had the Lexus. 
[01:34:00]  And then I saw that it was you in the driver's seat and decided to bust my balls hard for, like, 15 or 20 minutes where I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  And I had a few in me.  Yeah.  So he was asking me.  Had a few in you?  Oh, yeah.  He was asking me if I was drinking.  I said, well, just a couple.  You know, John Valby.  I told him who I was, and he was like, he was not buying the game either.  He could care less.  And then finally at the end, you know, he took my license and registration, the whole deal comes back, and then finally lets me off the hook. 
[01:34:30]  And I'm like, you fucking asshole.  Wow.  So you got to know how to name drop, man.  Like, I got pulled over, and I said, what?  And he comes over.  I said, I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  What?  And he went, all right, man?  Relax.  I'm sorry.  And that was it.  Because some people say, when they get pulled over, that the cops are immediately nasty to them.  And for that reason, I guess they feel they have to be nasty back.  And all that's going to do is get you in trouble. 
[01:35:00]  Why would you do that?  If the cop has a bad attitude coming to the window, why would you then make it even worse?  You just go through the motions.  Give him what he wants to see.  Listen to him.  If he's going to write you up, let him write you up.  That's it.  I rarely hear about people that get pulled over for something that really didn't do it.  You know?  Rarely.  Every time I get pulled over for something, god damn it, he's right.  I did it.  You know?  And then maybe you could get off the hook in the court. 
[01:35:30]  You know, one time a black officer pulled me over, and we had a little discussion.  And I said, what do you want?  And he said that you were driving too fast.  And I pointed at this alabaster skin, and I said, do you understand?  I'm in a hurry.  And he let me go.  I could have you shot for this.  In the heat of the night.  I could have you shot.  I could have you shot for that.  Aren't you going to do something?  Rod Staggers is standing there.  All right, let's go to some more Michael Jackson clips here, Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  So here's another clip about the case, I guess.  By showing the jury footage not used in the 2003 documentary on the singer, the jury sees a prepared and comfortable Jackson explaining his overall affection and affinity for children without being subject to cross-examination.  Yeah, that is a pretty good strategy.  Well, didn't the prosecution, I'm guessing the prosecution opened that can of proverbial candleworms by introducing the videotape. 
[01:36:30]  Some of the character stuff in court.  If you want to do character stuff, if one side introduces it, then it's open for the other side, too.  Right, but with this, you're pretty much getting Michael Jackson testifying for the defense.  He's pretty much defending himself in this video without the ability of the prosecution to cross-examine the guy.  I hate when guys don't take the stand.  I don't give a shit.  What the Constitution says, to me, it's an admission of guilt.  Unless you have Tourette's and you're liable to just yell something awful. 
[01:37:00]  And I know it can hurt you.  Look, Wayne Williams got busted because of his behavior on the stand.  And that was probably, I think, what ultimately convicted him, besides the fact that he had fibers of children.  But his behavior on the stand was so awful, and the FBI knew how to freak him out.  You know what it is?  Yeah, people, even for yourself, when the prosecution's on you, you're not going to make a good witness.  Most of the people that get up there do themselves a grave injustice when the prosecution starts hammering.  It's easy when your own lawyer is sitting there tossing up the softballs at you, and you're, you know, answering. 
[01:37:30]  And then the prosecution comes up, and, you know, you're blurting out things.  I don't remember our anniversary.  I have no idea.  Can we settle this now?  You know?  That was the best quote.  You get a little flustered.  Ever.  During Anthony's divorce case, he forgot his anniversary.  That is...  And, Mr. Cumia, when were you and Jennifer married? 
[01:38:00]  What is your wedding anniversary?  Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.  I got nothing here, Alex.  It's blank.  God.  You know how...  I had no clue.  You know how much that's got to hurt?  It doesn't matter how much money she got out of this whole thing, to know that you had no clue...  Out of my mind.  I put it out of my mind.  I knew it was the 19th of something.  No clue on probably the most special moment of her life. 
[01:38:30]  Yep.  Special moment.  You should have said that.  Her special day.  The 19th of something.  I mean, that's convincing.  It's the 19th of something.  You had 12 shots at it.  Anthony was quoted saying he had no idea.  I...  And it was in the newspaper.  Like, anybody else, that just...  It stays in the courtroom.  With me, it's in the Post and the Daily News.  And Anthony Cumia could not remember his anniversary.  Let's come back.  I thought it was...  See, what got me confused, I'll explain again. 
[01:39:00]  I lived in San Juan, Capistrano, California.  For all you people who are listening, hi, there in California.  I used to live there.  And Swallows Day was the day that the Swallows came back to Capistrano.  And it was March 19th is when the Swallows come back to Capistrano.  And I got that confused with May 19th, which was the wedding anniversary.  Because they're two very important things.  Well, the Swallows Day was very important back to when I was a kid. 
[01:39:30]  Burns coming...  Go ahead.  I said one had Swallows and one didn't.  And it was just...  It was that moment.  And that's what I'm talking about.  It's the stress and pressure of being cross-examined, of having the opposing team's lawyer question you.  If I sat there and thought about it, if someone just asked me in casual conversation,  when was your anniversary, I would think about it for a couple of seconds,  and I probably would have said May 19th. 
[01:40:00]  But with Dominic Barber's fat fucking face blurting out the question,  and why, because I'm just thinking of how phony-friendly he's trying to be.  Hello, Anthony.  And he blurts out the question, and I just went,  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Oh, and I just see the post in the Daily News guy in the little gallery with their little notepad.  And at that moment, they look at me, and then they just...  They're scribbling little notes down. 
[01:40:30]  They're like, oh, no.  So that made it even worse.  I'd be the worst witness.  Please.  I'm awful.  I get up there.  I remember years and years and years ago,  this woman, a friend of mine, his mother, was trying to pass the bar.  And the school she was going to had this mock court thing that she had to do.  So she goes, I just need some of you guys, if you could come down and be some witnesses.  Here's a script, whatever.  You're playing this guy.  It's some kind of rape case, and you're a doctor, 
[01:41:00]  and you have to dispute some of the evidence.  Okay, I read the script.  I get up there.  It's, mind you, a mock phony trial.  This is fake.  I choked.  I completely choked.  Where I think someone really went to jail,  based on my fake testimony in a mock trial.  Somebody actually went to jail.  It was horrible.  The pressure in there is just unbelievable.  I'll get up on stage.  I'll do what we do at road shows.  I'll get up in front with a band. 
[01:41:30]  Things like that, fine.  But under that circumstance of a courtroom,  I just lose my mind.  I couldn't do it.  I got a really good story that maybe Ben needs to be in here for.  Remember that producer from O'Reilly's show?  Here comes Ben.  This is a great story.  Ben has given a thumbs up.  Remember...  I think you've followed on the questioning.  Which one?  From the fugitive?  Well, remember Stephanie?  Who, I don't know if she's still producing, 
[01:42:00]  but she produced for O'Reilly?  Yeah, we've talked about her over the years,  but basically she was a producer for O'Reilly, right?  Yeah.  And they were trying to get Anthony and I on O'Reilly's show for a long time,  and they were using this girl, Stephanie,  like she was coming into our show, interviewing us,  talking to us, trying to convince us this would be a good thing.  Remember she used to hang out in the studio with us, Anthony, right?  All this stuff.  And we really got to know her, right?  We were in a conference room with her.  She sat us down, face-to-face meeting, 
[01:42:30]  in the studio, watching the show,  getting the feel of the show,  going back to Fox,  trying to work out this whole deal for the O'Reilly people, right?  So I used to stay in the city at this point,  and I went down to where Ben was living at the time,  and we went and had a few drinks, okay?  And she happened to be at one of the bars.  We ran into her, yeah.  We ran into Stephanie down there, right?  She's smoking cigarettes.  She's drinking.  We're not thinking anything, okay?  We go back to her apartment, 
[01:43:00]  because she says there's some kind of party going on.  And we go into her apartment,  and a bunch of her roommates and their friends  were listening to Pink Floyd, was it?  Dark Side of the Moon.  Dark Side of the Moon,  and they were just completely hammered.  The lights off and just like, yeah.  Lights off and stuff.  Why does this story sound familiar?  I've told you.  I don't think I've ever told it on the air, though.  Really?  No, this has never been told on the air.  I don't think so.  Not the whole story.  No?  No.  All right, because I'm kind of thinking,  I remember hearing this recently,  and I thought it was on the air.  Off the air, we talked about it. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, off the air.  Yeah, there's a couple other parts of the story.  So we weren't really feeling it,  because these people were really just shit-faced  and just laying around with black lights on  and lava lamps and dark side of the moon playing.  And Stephanie goes,  hey, guys, you want to come up to the roof?  I got a really, really cool view.  So we go up there with some beers or something, Ben, right?  Yeah, something.  Yeah, she just proceeded to apply Opie.  Yeah, she was trying to... 
[01:44:00]  This is one of the stories that we couldn't tell for years.  Yeah, because it was weird.  So we're on the roof,  and she's showing us the view,  and we're drinking and stuff.  And I'm getting kind of uncomfortable,  because now she's hitting on me,  and I'm thinking,  well, we're trying to do something with Fox and Bill O'Reilly.  This is not a good scene, you know?  And then Ben, like,  you had enough of that point, right?  I left.  Yeah, I left you there.  Ben leaves.  I'm still on the roof with this girl.  She goes, I'll be right back.  She comes back upstairs with a blanket. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  She wants action,  and she's got...  That pretty much says it all right there.  She's got more, you know,  beers happening and stuff.  And I had some guilt there,  because, you know,  I was going out with someone.  I'm like, I can't.  I can't.  Yeah, I'm trying to get out of this situation now, right?  So I go back downstairs,  and I'm trying to remember  how this next part happened,  but I guess I was in the...  I'm trying to remember.  There was some reason I didn't leave right away.  I was hanging out in the living room  with all the stoners and stuff, right? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And these guys were basically passing out  all over the room.  And all of a sudden,  I hear this voice going,  Opie, and I'm like, yeah, what?  And she goes, come here.  And the bathroom door is, like, slightly askew.  I go in there.  She's completely naked in a bathtub  with candles all around.  Scrubbing her bush.  Really?  I swear to God,  wants to show you it's clean.  So she's taking a bath,  and I'm like, wow.  So I check it out for a few minutes.  Like, that's really cool.  Then I start laughing like an idiot  because I'm like, 
[01:45:30]  I just can't do this, you know?  I swear to you, I can't do this.  And I run out of the place.  Where was Fred?  I know, right?  Was Fred in the tub behind her?  Did you leave your underpants,  your wet underpants in the car?  So,  you're ripping me off, Rob.  I invented chicks naked in the bathtub.  Yeah, this story sounds familiar.  So,  I just start  just giggling like an idiot,  and I run out.  I run out on her.  I'm like, no,  this can't happen, you know?  So I'm running down the stairs 
[01:46:00]  of her apartment.  She gets to the top of the stairs.  She's hammered in a bathrobe  wide open,  yelling and screaming at me  because I won't have sex with her.  Wow.  And I ran out of there laughing.  I called Ben immediately,  like, dude,  you're not going to believe  this fucking story.  So I tell him, right?  So then, yeah,  and then two days later  we did the Hooters signing.  All right, yeah,  this is where it gets really good.  So, you know,  it was supposed to be  a professional relationship  because she wanted us  on O'Reilly  and vice versa.  It's like,  not a good thing  if you're, you know, 
[01:46:30]  banging the producer  of O'Reilly's show  while they're trying  to get you on there.  So remember the CD signing,  the magazine signing  we did at Hooters?  Of course.  We were in a lot of magazines  because we just got syndicated  and a bunch of magazines  did stories on us  all at the same time.  So we came up with this idea  to get our listeners together  and we'll sign some magazines  and have a good time  at the Hooters,  drink some beers and stuff.  Remember the beer fight  and all that that happened?  So anyway.  Wasn't Erin there  earlier that night  making out?  Who?  Erin,  who I eventually went up dating,  was there earlier.  I didn't meet her that night 
[01:47:00]  but she was making out  with another chick  at that Hooters signing  earlier that night.  Yes, you're right.  The one that became  your girlfriend for a while.  I didn't meet her that day though  but she was making out  It was just one of our  just wild get-togethers.  It was a wild party.  It turned out to be  a huge beer fight later on.  But anyway,  finally what I'm about to say  that ties into  what Anthony was saying.  We're at the front table  signing the Penthouse interview  and whatever other magazines  we're in  and I'm sitting next to Anthony  and everything's good,  a long line,  we have beers and everything. 
[01:47:30]  All of a sudden  I turned to Ben.  Ben has this look on his face  and I'm like,  what, Ben?  And all of a sudden  he's freaking out.  I go, what?  And all of a sudden  he points to his left arm  like this,  starts tapping it  and points to Stephanie.  Yeah.  I turn  and for the first time  notice that she has  a fake arm.  Yeah.  A fake arm.  She had  a completely  fake mannequin arm  with a little bracelet on it.  It's plastic. 
[01:48:00]  It's like one of those  when you lose your arm  they don't give you a hook anymore  for the most part.  You get these plastic arms  that actually  some of them can move.  Get a little movement.  Right.  But hers I don't think moved.  No, no.  It just was a mannequin hand.  It didn't move at all.  Hold on.  We're going to get Corey  from Yonkers on the phone.  Corey.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  What's up?  Is this the same chick  you guys were partying  with her back in the studio  and you took a picture  of her skirt  and a tampon string  was hanging out?  No.  What happened was  Yes, that is the same girl.  Is that the same day though? 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  Same day.  It was right after the party.  We all went home  but she went back  to the office  with Stinky I think.  She went back to the office.  Smoked pot with Stinky.  And smoked pot  and I think they even  had a little thing.  And Rick drew an arrow  on her  Rick drew stuff  on her legs  with Sharpies.  There was an arrow  pointing to her snatch.  Yeah.  And she still was  working me  trying to get me  and I used to have  this disposable camera  on my desk  for when Slurbies came by.  Oh, let's get a photo  type of thing.  And she proceeded  to take pictures  of herself  her snatch. 
[01:49:00]  Because she had a skirt on  so she threw the camera  down there  and was just snapping away.  String coming down.  And she forgot  that she was having her time  so all these pictures  had a string.  Didn't it strike you  as odd when she was  holding all of her beers  with one hand?  Like, you know,  just drinking  and picking it up  and then kind of  just draping the towel  over that awful left arm?  There was nothing else  going on.  But this is the point  I want to make  about being an awful witness.  Here's a girl  that spent a lot  of time with us  leading up to the interview  with Bill O'Reilly.  We had, like I said,  face-to-face.  She was writing 
[01:49:30]  on a notepad.  She was in studio.  None of that really matters,  does it?  Huh?  None of that  as far as being  a bad witness  really matters  because I didn't notice.  But the clincher, Opie,  of you being  a horrible witness  is the fact that  you were looking at her  naked in a bathtub  and didn't notice  you had a fake arm.  That's why Ben and I  were like,  what?  Because she's naked  in this bathtub.  She's on the roof.  She's partying with us.  She was in the bar  smoking and drinking  and not,  this is the point  I want to make.  Not one of us,  not one of the crew  noticed that this girl 
[01:50:00]  had a fake arm  until we were at Hooters.  What Jimmy did?  Jim noticed.  When did you notice?  It was the first time  I met her.  Jim was the first  one to point it out  and I think Voss was there.  When did you say  it was at Hooters?  No, it was at Hooters.  I remember Jim  and I think  were sitting with Voss  and they were laughing  hysterically  and they're the ones  who pointed it out.  Jim's the one  who came over  and told me.  It was the creepiest feeling  when finally  Ben got my attention  and said,  look,  oh my God,  freaking out  and I turned  and when I saw  that plastic arm  I'm like, 
[01:50:30]  I got this weird feeling  and like,  did she just lose  that arm  like last week?  How did we not notice?  It all adds up  like,  ah,  we're in Macy's  and you thought  you started talking  to the mannequins.  Now I understand.  But just going back  to this,  being a horrendous witness,  you know?  Yeah,  that seems to be  something you would have  caught in the bathtub.  I just started laughing.  I'm like,  there's no way  I'm doing this.  Sorry.  No.  Call me whatever  you have to,  but I have to go home. 
[01:51:00]  I have to go home.  I got Allison at home.  I have to go immediately.  And then it's  because she's all drunk  and stuff  just screaming at me  from the top of the stairs.  Why don't you fuck me up?  Why are you rejecting me?  The bathroom.  Is she dripping still?  It was just  the whole thing  that was going on.  Can we play  the last couple  of Michael Jackson clips?  And then we'll finally  go to break with something.  All right,  here's another clip  from the Michael Jackson case.  Jackson says he essentially 
[01:51:30]  had no childhood himself.  His youth was spent  on stage  and in a recording studio.  And he says he's made up  for that at Neverland Ranch.  He also says  he's inspired  by the innocence  and purity of children  and without them  would throw in the towel.  Throw in the towel.  As opposed to doing what?  Wiping loads up with it?  Toweling up.  Yeah.  All right,  and finally,  this last clip.  He says Jackson  never touched him sexually  and he believes  the allegations  in this case  are absolutely ridiculous. 
[01:52:00]  Culkin says  he and Jackson bonded  because both  had abnormal childhoods  due to sudden fame.  You know,  there's one thing  about bonding  because you had  abnormal childhoods  once you're both adults.  You could commiserate.  It's not...  you can't talk  to a child  who's in that point  in his life  and you as an adult  and it just seems to me  to be another ploy  for him to get  in their little pants.  You know,  oh, I understand. 
[01:52:30]  Isn't it tough sometimes?  Oh, yeah, yeah,  it's real tough sometimes.  Yeah, wouldn't you like  to just be a kid  every so often?  Yeah, yeah, I would, yeah.  Could you suck  on this right here?  Then we'll go  on a merry-go-round.  Maybe he didn't  with Macaulay.  Maybe Macaulay  because he's an actor  and famous  was too, like,  aware or too, like...  Yeah, it could be.  I'm sure they get  vibes off kids, too.  I'm not getting vibes  about this one.  This one could be trouble.  Yeah, it could be  a little blabbermouth.  You've got to assess 
[01:53:00]  cuteness to risk factor,  the formula.  I could go  for the uglier kid.  He's a lot lower risk.  That fat kid  will never tell a soul.  He'll be happy  about this.  Let's say hi to Eric  in Indianapolis.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering  what would Opie have done  if he had started  banging that chick  in the bathtub  and her arm fell off?  I think I would have  had a heart attack.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you see the arm  floating in the tub.  Yes, floating.  Like that MASH episode  when Hawkeye has nightmares. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, with the limbs  going down the river?  Yeah.  It was pretty creepy.  It's great.  All right, well,  we should take a break.  Regroup here.  The bath water  going out  and the arm  slowly spinning  over the drain.  Say, wait a minute.  Well, like you're  kissing at one end  of the tub  and you feel a finger  in your ass  at the other side  of the tub.  How the hell  is she doing that?  She's good.  What the?  Ben?  You? 
[01:54:00]  Ben and I laughed  about that for months.  For months.  He only laughed  because Ben  has a big plastic hog.  Oh, I forgot to mention  the same thing  me and Ant did  until me and Ope did.  We were at the  Rolling Stone thing.  I forgot about this.  Ope's sitting on one side  and I'm sitting  on the other side  and we just keep  glancing down  at Ben's cock  and I'm lifting  my sunglasses up  and just peering  out of the bottom  and just shame-filled Ben  just has to keep  covering it  with his little arms.  Isn't he so ashamed  when he covers it up?  Oh, it's hilarious.  The best thing he can do  is just call us assholes 
[01:54:30]  and then cover up.  You guys are assholes  and he kind of crosses  his legs  and covers it up  with shame.  So self-conscious  that he has to hide  that delicious gift  that God has given him.  It is a fun game  though, I gotta tell ya.  Oh, he gets so uncomfortable.  It's just fun to embarrass him  because he's so easily riled.  Because Norton and I  kind of nodded  at each other  like, alright, it's time  and so we both  just slowly  move our gaze down  to his crotch  and then you could just  feel that he's  really uncomfortable. 
[01:55:00]  He'll say a few things  that don't really  amount to any type  of words.  It just kind of  covers it.  He's trying to make  like a joke  and it's not working.  But he knows  we're not gay.  He knows it's like  looking at Stonehenge  or some other marvel.  Yeah, you gotta look  at it just  because it's there  and it's so huge.  TJ.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Nah, I was just saying  the reason why  she probably  started screaming  at you at the top  of the stairs 
[01:55:30]  is because  she's seen her  naked and started  to laugh.  She probably thought  it was because  of the arm.  You know, I never  thought about that  but maybe she  thought I finally  discovered she had  one arm.  Yeah, she probably  just thought you're  a complete jerk, dude.  It was the weirdest  day, man.  That was the weirdest  night.  All right.  We should break.  Overgrown G.I.  Joe hand  giving you a handjob.  With no grip.  Every time she moves  it you hear like  the thing of plastic  and the abrasion. 
[01:56:00]  No gription.  No gription?  No gription.  Is that a word?  No.  Anthony,  we'll go to break  with the caulk bit.  Caulk?  Um, this is an old  lady, what, calling  like Home Depot or  something?  Uh, yeah.  Anthony did a great  old lady voice there  for us in Boston  and, uh, we  discovered, I guess.  This actually isn't  a great voice.  It's supposed to be  an old Boston woman  voice but it's  actually, um, a  complete rip-off of  Billy West doing 
[01:56:30]  Marge Shot.  Wow!  Yeah, why not?  Is it?  I'm willing to  fess up.  Yeah, it was like  Billy West's Marge  Shot impression.  All right.  And, uh, what we  discovered that  they pronounced  a lot of words,  uh, strangely up  there.  Yeah, like  caulk would be  caulk.  Say it like  caulk.  So we had a  little fun with  that whole thing.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly  woman.  I just moved  here from  Boston, Massachusetts  and, uh, I  have a leaky  bathtub.  Uh-huh.  I believe I 
[01:57:00]  need caulk  to fill in  the hole.  You need  pardon me?  I need  caulk!  Okay, please  hold.  Thank you for  holding.  We will be  with you shortly.  Hello?  Yes, I'm in  desperate need  of caulk.  The old caulk  just ain't  working anymore.  Okay.  Over in the  paint department  they have  GE silicone  they got for  that.  Is that  good caulk?  Sure is.  And that  works good  in the  bathtub?  Sure does.  Could I  speak to  someone in  the  paint  department?  Sure,  hold on  one second.  You should  call back  caulk.  Hello, 
[01:57:30]  miss,  I need  caulk.  You need  caulk?  No,  I need  caulk.  If I  needed caulk,  I would  have said  caulk.  Clark.  Does he  supply the  caulk?  Can you  spell this  for me?  C-A-U-L-K,  caulk.  Please  hold.  Hello?  Paint department.  Hi, I need  caulk.  Huh?  I need  caulk.  Caulk?  Caulk.  Yeah?  I need  caulk,  because I  own a  house now  and all  the caulk  in my  house is  all dried 
[01:58:00]  up.  Okay.  I need  some brand  new caulk.  You carry  caulk?  You need  caulk?  Yes,  I need  caulk  for my  bathtub.  Um,  what kind?  What kind  of color  are you  looking for?  I don't  really care.  I like  white caulk,  but I'll  take any  color.  The caulk  that's in  my house  is all  dried and  cracked.  Oh,  it's leaky  caulk.  I need  new caulk.  All right,  well,  we got  all sorts  of shapes  and varieties  here on  caulk for  you.  All kinds 
[01:58:30]  of shapes  of caulk?  Oh,  yeah,  we even  have one  that's  about  two feet  long.  Really,  darling?  A tube,  yeah.  Well,  that's a  lot of  caulk.  Yeah.  I probably  could use  that much.  Yeah,  a lot of  people could.  Thank you,  sir,  you've been  very kind.  Also,  we have  some special  guns to  attach to  the caulk,  you know,  get a little  more width  there.  Caulk,  gun?  Yep.  Oh,  that sounds  very exciting.  I'll have  to come  down.  All right,  we got  plenty for  you.  Thank you  very much.  And if you  don't see  anything on  the shelf  you like,  some of  our employees  have their  own that  they give  to you.  Their own 
[01:59:00]  special  brand of  caulk?  Oh,  yeah.  That's  wonderful,  darling.  We do  everything  for you  here.  Thank you  very much,  son.  We even  send someone  over to  your house  sometimes to  help you  use it.  They'll  install the  caulk?  Yep,  they'll  install it  All right,  so you  have a  good day,  man.  Thank you,  son.  Bye.  Hope he  really doesn't  care about  our lives.  And I hate  you all.  Oh!  And I hate  you all.  Oh!  And I hate 
[01:59:30]  you all.  Oh!  And I hate  you all.  Oh!  You've  got to  help me.  Look,  jerky,  I don't  need to  talk to  you.  All right,  kids,  hold on  your hats.  One,  two,  three.  Don't  blow his  monkey head.  It's our 
[02:00:00]  show,  you  tool.  Y'all  don't 
[02:00:30]  don't  I knew  this was  a scare.  Y'all  don't  don't  don't  I can't  go on.  Opie  and  Anthony.  Come on,  it's not  funny anymore.  Make it  stop.  Make it  stop.  Opie  and  Anthony  XM202  I just 
[02:01:00]  did it  again.  Fighting  being  inside of  your mouth.  Oh my  God.  You know  what helps  with that?  You ever  have somebody  just take  their finger  and put  like a little  clear stuff  on it?  Rub it  in.  Get a  good one  inside my  mouth.  Lower lip.  I bit it  last night  at dinner  I guess.  Yeah.  So it's  you know  swells up 
[02:01:30]  slightly.  Uh huh.  Now I just  keep biting  it and  biting it  all morning  long.  Yeah.  Once it  swells up  now it's  right in  the line  of fire  there  between  the teeth.  And then  it takes  forever  to heal.  Everything's  kind of  meshed  perfectly.  Sweetie.  You know  what I once  did?  The worst  pain I've  ever felt  and I've  broken  bones.  I was  eating like  a steak  or something  something with  a bone  and I  scraped  I had the  bone in  my mouth  and I  scraped the  top of  my mouth  the bone  in my  mouth. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah that  didn't sound  good.  Sure did.  I scraped  you know  way up there  the palate  or whatever  it's called  at the top  where there's  barely any  skin before  it's bone  there I guess.  Skin?  What do they  call that?  Onion paper.  And I  scraped  whatever  skin or  tissue there  was there  right down  I'm assuming  to that bone  or whatever  the cartilage  whatever it is  Anthony you  would know  best.  That thing  took months  to heal  and every  sip of  water 
[02:02:30]  every bite  of food  your mouth  gets slightly  dry just  excruciating  pain.  Yeah the  mouth does  take some  abuse.  And it  wouldn't  heal  because it  was just  it's not  like you  know getting  a cut  on your  arm or  something.  There's  a lot  to work  with there  there was  nothing.  Well it  can't scab  either because  of the  moisture so it's  really hard.  It was  unbelievable  how long  that lasted.  I remember  when I was  a kid  you'd go  crazy and  eat a whole  box of  Captain Crunch  and the  roof of your  mouth would  just be in  tatters.  It would be  like this 
[02:03:00]  thing just  hanging from  it.  The tattered  flesh because  of the abrasiveness  of the Captain  Crunch.  Or you'd burn  your mouth.  Yeah you could  sand your floor.  Once you burn  your mouth it's  over too.  You get that  weird ugh  burnt mouth  feeling.  You could  definitely sand  your floor with  Captain Crunch.  Just take a  handful.  And I'm not  even talking  with the  milk.  You're just  out of the  box.  Just take  fistfuls and  start eating  it.  Some quick  O&A business.  A bunch of  new boobs on  ratemywow.com. 
[02:03:30]  I haven't  checked that  out in a  while.  According to  Steve another  website he's  running ratemywow.com  and the video of  Sandy Kane making  Robert Kelly puke  from yesterday is  up and it is  really really  funny.  So if you get  a chance go to  opianthony.com  later today to  check that out  and other  things.  Okay?  I have a  question to  an opinion.  Yeah.  I was going to  go out to  dinner with a  young lady last  night who I've  liked for a  long time and  in the afternoon  she text messages  me and says  can't make it had a  relative come in  from out of town. 
[02:04:00]  Is that a bad  sign?  text message.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  That's not a good  sign.  That's not a good  sign at all.  Not even a  message, phone  call, a text.  Who came in?  Uh, sister.  Close relative.  Yeah, but see.  I get it.  Believe me.  Okay. 
[02:04:30]  I know.  I don't have to  explain, right?  Hey, look, I'd  love to sleep, but  maybe we can meet  for a drink or  dessert or  something real quick.  A close relative,  you know when  they're coming in  advance.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they don't  just drop it.  I don't have a  sister or brother  that ever just  surprises me and  says, hey, guess  what?  I'm two blocks  away.  How you doing?  But if anybody  out there wonders  why I do what I  do, it's this is  why.  Yeah.  Every time you  try to be a  person, you try to  be nice, you try  to be, this is  what happens.  So don't question  be nice, get a  nice girl. 
[02:05:00]  There are none.  Get a nice girl,  settle down.  Get a nice girl  every night, ma.  Wow, a text  message and you  were all set?  You were probably  all showered up?  I know, I'm  going to get my  car washed.  Because you  were going to  pick her up?  Well, it would  have met her  and then drove  her.  Get the old  car, get the  old Saturn cleaned.  You're whistling  a nice little tune  in your head, like  all happy, it's  spring, the birds  are out.  I threw my  piss cup away.  What a beautiful  day.  Right.  That's awful.  Text, text message. 
[02:05:30]  Message.  Oh, I just, I  really loathe life.  Yeah.  I just loathe it.  Um, Anthony, um.  You got to get  the hooker, right?  Dude, it's just,  that's what it is.  Did you get the  hooker last night?  Of course I did.  Of course he did.  He goes from, it's  going to be a nice  little evening with  a real girl.  I'm part of normal  society for once.  He's going to be  like a real human  being for a night  and then it's back  to, and knowing  you, you couldn't  just get a regular  hooker.  It had to be a  dirty one, right?  No, it was  actually a decent, 
[02:06:00]  you know, whatever.  Middle of the road.  Uneventful.  Uneventful.  Meaningless.  Forgetting what's  going on experience.  You know, you just,  you can't be nice, man.  Honest to God, you  can't fucking be a  person.  What was, what was  nice?  Were you, what were  you doing that was  nice?  I mean, like, you  can't look at somebody  nicely.  You can't.  He's been working  with this girl  for a little while.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've known  her for a long time.  Oh, really?  You can see it on  his face.  He was thinking  that this could be  a cool little thing  that might, who  knows, might lead  to something.  Jimmy Robinson 
[02:06:30]  had a point.  Oh, nobody likes  Jimmy Norton.  I was just so, it  was, it's not even  upsetting, it's more  like, it's a  confirmation of  everything you know.  Yeah.  You know, it's  like, it happens  too much to be  upsetting.  You're too used to  it.  It's just, it's  just, oh, here we  go again.  And it's not even  about getting laid  or sex.  I'm not talking  about that.  You know, it's  like, this time  we just want to  go out and be  whatever.  No, you were  going to go on  a real date.  Or just a dinner.  I don't know if  it would have been  a date or whatever,  but it would have  been a nice time.  That's a date if  you're going to 
[02:07:00]  dinner with some  girl.  That's considered  a date.  If you're friends  with somebody,  though, it depends  if both people  think it's a date.  Like, I didn't  know if she would  consider it that,  so I didn't,  because she might  just be considered,  well, this is a  friend of mine.  Yeah.  You don't know.  You know she got  together with her  friends, and that's  what they decided,  the easy way to  let you down.  I know.  I completely know.  Just text message  him.  Can I really...  Say that a family  is coming in.  I know.  Really fast before  we forget, we just  played our cock bit  that we did years  ago.  I don't want to,  I don't know, I 
[02:07:30]  don't want to play  the rip-off game,  but Danny found  some English dude  doing the same bit.  Some guy in  England came over  and stole the bit,  Robin.  Yeah, he must have  listened to our show  and then flew back  on the Concord.  But I just want to  play it just because  you can see the  difference in the two  bits.  All right.  This is really bad.  Hello.  Hello, this is  Niall Standish 
[02:08:00]  calling.  Hello, sir.  Hello.  I was calling  because I had some  questions about cock.  For my bathroom.  Okay, so you're  going to want mildew  resistant?  Yeah, sounds all  right.  Okay.  I'm sure you know  more about cock than  I do.  Okay.  All right.  Now, how big is  this cock?  It is in a 10  ounce tube and it  comes in clear.  Now, does the  cock smell?  It's got kind of an  order to it for about  24 hours.  Oh, and that'll 
[02:08:30]  dissipate.  Is there a taste to  the cock?  What was the last  question?  Is it dangerous?  Is it poisonous in  case the cock gets in  my mouth or in my  eye?  Well, you don't want  to get it in your  eye because it does  have some solvents in  it.  I mean, it's an  acid-cure cock.  There's many  different kinds of  cock, yes?  Yes, sir.  All right.  How many different  kinds of cock do  you handle?  For around tubs and  sinks and stuff like  that?  Just one.  Wherever, wherever.  Well, I have a bunch 
[02:09:00]  of cocks that you can,  you know, weatherproof your  concrete and for  expansion joints and  stuff like that.  And does the cock  harden or?  No, it doesn't.  There's not many  cocks that do.  You'd have to go with  epoxies for it to be  real hard.  As far as colors of  cock go, what about  colors?  Well, if you get it in  tubes, you only have  about eight colors to  choose from.  Like?  Like dark grays to  light grays to browns,  whites.  You don't have any  black cock?  Yeah.  Now, the black cock, is  that bigger?  Yeah, but I don't have 
[02:09:30]  the black sanitary  cock.  So the black cock is  unsanitary?  Well, it's not.  Okay, so just so I  have this straight, you  handle a lot of  different kind of  cock, you carry black  cock and white cock,  and the cock doesn't  get hard, and it's  okay to get the cock in  your mouth.  No.  You definitely don't  want the cock in your  mouth.  Well, speak for  yourself, love.  Have a good day, sir.  Ta!  Not bad for what it 
[02:10:00]  is.  Those things are, you  know, consider the one  we did was ten years  ago.  Dude, this was on  Crank Yankers.  Was it?  No.  That was a Crank  Yankers prank call?  Ugh.  Standish.  Yeah.  That was awful.  Yeah.  All right, where  were we?  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  Why are you laughing,  Ben?  He laughs at Jim's  misery sometimes.  He sent Jim a text  message just to try  and be funny.  Oh, I have friends  in it.  Oh, all right.  I got that.  But my phone, it 
[02:10:30]  doesn't show up.  I know it doesn't  say who it is, because  I remember sending  you one the night  you wanted to get  Bono's photo.  I don't know.  I don't know why it  doesn't show up as  to who's texting me.  Maybe I don't know  how it's said properly.  What did it say?  I just said I have  friends in it.  I was just fucking  with him.  But Voss keeps  calling me, by the  way.  He's like, did I do  okay?  Are you guys still  listening?  He didn't do okay,  because he was  chicken to mention  us on the show.  Yeah, why didn't  he?  He said we put him  in the most awkward  position he's ever  been in.  All right.  I doubt that. 
[02:11:00]  Exactly.  Now we have to get  him on, because now  I want to know why  he was in an awkward  position.  Hey, Corey, what's  up?  How much?  How's it going  today, guys?  We're doing well.  I was wondering if  Jimmy left that girl  about 50 messages  last night.  I will not be  ignored.  Look, I understand  if you don't want  to see me, but  you could be like  a real person.  I said, look,  this is the  Jimster.  I mean, I don't  really care about  you either way.  I swear to God, 
[02:11:30]  no, I don't leave  messages.  I don't ever do that.  You're not all  that.  I thought to myself,  and it was just a  fleeting thought,  but it's her loss,  and then I remember  what we talked  about.  That does hit  you, though.  When you say  it's your loss,  it isn't.  But you never  vocalize it, but it  did hit me for a  second.  Like, yeah, her  loss, dates on.  Because you start  thinking, she could  be hanging out with  a guy with a good  personality, she'll  have some fun with  Jimmy, and it's her  loss if she doesn't  want to, oh, my  God, I just said  it's her loss.  Yeah, it's gotten  that fast, and I  realized, man, ass 
[02:12:00]  I am.  But it's like,  what do you got to  do to, you know,  what?  Every time I like a  girl, it's like some  inaccessible person.  Are you aiming high?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, she's a very  attractive girl, but.  Yeah, no, she's  cool, man.  Yeah, it's not like.  She's definitely a  cool girl.  It's not like she's  some stripper or  somebody who's got  like a million issues  was, you know, but  it's not like that.  And you asked her to  just go out to dinner,  you said?  I know her for a  long time, and it's  like lately we've been  talking more, you know, 
[02:12:30]  just a little bit of  stuff.  Nothing major, just  lately, like, you know  how you kind of sense  like, all right, we're  talking more.  Yeah.  And, but like when you  realize you're the one  making all the effort to  like get together, it's  like, what the fuck am I  doing?  Just spend the money,  that's what you do.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  But when you asked her,  did it sound like she  was really into going  out with you for a  night?  Yeah, you don't know.  I mean, who knows?  Every time I make a  judgment like that, it's  wrong.  Every, every time.  Maybe it's not.  Maybe you just kind of  see things like that. 
[02:13:00]  Maybe you're so used to  it and thinking you're so  like not worthy of this  type of relationship that  all of a sudden, the  second something even  seems a little off, you  go, wow, see, here,  there it goes again.  I know I have that  propensity for negative  thinking, but there are  times where you got to  be dumb not to see it.  I mean, you're pretty  perceptive with that stuff  and you got to be dumb  not to see it.  Because this seems like  an odd situation, like  you have been talking  with her, you get along  well, you've known each  other for a while, it  doesn't seem like one of  those girls that out of 
[02:13:30]  the blue that you kind of  just asked out and now  she's making an excuse.  I know, but it does seem  like somebody who likes me  a lot as a person.  Yeah.  And I know she does.  I know it's genuine.  But doesn't really know  how to go look, I  really would rather not.  Liking you as a person  includes going out to  dinner.  Understandable, but when  somebody knows you like  them, then they have a  decision to make, like,  well, do I want to put  myself in a position where  it could be uncomfortable  or do I want to avoid it?  I can understand that.  So I'm not kicking her 
[02:14:00]  like, whatever, I'm just  a zilch and I know it.  I mean, that's, but  that's, you understand,  so I can kind of  understand her.  Did she say, you know,  we'll get together  another time?  She just left me a text.  If you could have left a  message, I would have had a  little bit more like,  all right, well, that's  cool.  How old is she?  Almost 26.  And you had definite  plans with her, right?  Oh, yeah.  A few days ago.  I knew it was going to  happen, though.  But I did.  Was it last minute?  The text message?  Yeah, the afternoon.  Oh, that afternoon.  It was like 4.50.  And how far in advance  has this been planned? 
[02:14:30]  Three days.  Three days?  And then that afternoon?  Yeah, I knew it, though.  But I knew something was  going to happen.  You know.  I just didn't know.  Of course.  I always do.  People are like, you're so  negative.  No, I'm not.  I'm accurate.  Realistic.  Oh, dude.  Beyond belief.  Beyond belief.  Poor little.  That's all right.  Whatever.  I deserve every scumbag move.  No matter what happens  to me, I deserve it.  But it's still annoying.  I mean, I can't knock her  or whatever.  She just didn't know  how else to get out of it.  Yeah.  But no, it's amazing. 
[02:15:00]  I knew it when I made  the plans.  This won't go.  No.  Absolutely not.  It's like when you know  Rivera doesn't have it.  You watch the Yankees  and you're like, you know what?  They're going to lose this.  It's 3-1.  Not good.  No outs.  You know there's  going to be a problem.  Yeah.  People are like, you're just  negative.  No, I've just seen this  many times.  And when his fastball  is, when his breaking ball  is not cracking,  there's problems.  Well, that's the way  it is here.  Yeah.  Something's going on  with the Yankees,  by the way.  Ben went to the game  yesterday and there's 
[02:15:30]  like Japanese billboards  and stuff.  Oh, the Japs love them.  Japanese writing right  on the right field fence  there.  Come on.  It's really strange.  You love it.  Not suey or abu.  They're just following  him like crazy and the  stadium is filled with  those fine folks.  The stadium knows it  because they're selling  ad space.  Yeah.  That's in Japanese.  Japanese.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we should play  a couple of psycho  ex-girlfriend calls  today.  Yep.  This would be a good  segue.  Where did we leave the 
[02:16:00]  psycho ex-girlfriend,  Anthony?  This is like an ongoing  soap opera.  I guess we left with her  pretty much saying she's  done.  Remember, she's definitely  going to move.  This is the last time  you're going to hear  from me.  Yeah.  I'm going back to  Allentown.  I'm done.  That's it.  You don't have to worry  about me anymore.  That's it.  I'm done.  It's over.  You're lost pretty much.  Right?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Oh, it's a shorty.  This is where we left  off yesterday just to  bring everyone up to  speed.  Sage message.  Wednesday, February  7th, 10, 42 p.m. 
[02:16:30]  Okay.  Well, it's done.  I'm out of here.  And I know you checked  all your godforsaken  voicemails I've left you.  I called you I don't know  how many times again  tonight and well, I guess  that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter that  I'm going back so I just  thought I'd fill you in.  So, you have a good life  and I guess I'll catch you  in the next one maybe.  Bye.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Have a good life and 
[02:17:00]  they're going to meet  maybe in another life.  That's right.  Okay.  So, it's obviously over,  right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Quickly, to go back for a  second though, we actually  have a, we had a microphone  in the Saturn.  What?  Yeah, we had a microphone  in Jimmy's car after he got  the text message.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[02:17:30]  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Wow.  Jimmy, you sounded a little  upset.  I don't know what happened.  I'm like, do you want to  text me on the phone?  Let's calm you down a little  bit.  Can I text you?  Can I calm him down,  Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, this will make him  feel better.  See, everything's okay now,  Jimmy.  You don't have to be sad.  That's life's plan change.  Look, he's bobbing his head.  Everything's okay now.  Oh, we got Jimmy back.  It's all all right.  It's all good.  This song makes him happy. 
[02:18:00]  Life is what happens when  you're making other plans.  Get over here, you.  There you go.  That's all it takes.  You all right now, Jimmy?  It's only good while the  music's on.  Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.  There we are.  You come and go.  You come and go.  But mostly go.  Couldn't even pick up the  phone like a decent fucking  human being.  I've been almost 10 years.  You come and go.  I truly am shit. 
[02:18:30]  There you go.  One of your girlfriends is on  the line here.  Rich Voss.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Why didn't you mention us on  that show?  Yeah.  I was mentioning you, and I  thought we were on air and we  were on break.  I was talking about you guys.  You didn't know that thought  you were on air.  You've been doing radio a long  time.  You know when you're on air  and off the air.  Come on, let me tell you  something.  I mention you guys everywhere,  okay?  I've been kicked out of studios 
[02:19:00]  for mentioning these jackassers.  You didn't mention us today.  That's right.  And I did.  I mentioned Norton.  Yeah, we heard that.  You mentioned my blood.  No, but I said how funny you  guys are.  How all the guys I hang out  with are funny guys.  All my friends, I go, you  know, they're creeps and zeros,  but they're all funny.  And I mentioned Norton and  Patrice.  All right.  And I was talking about you  guys and maybe it was  during a break.  Maybe.  You know that you were  doing it.  I always talk about you 
[02:19:30]  guys.  And I did.  When I first got in there,  I hate to tell you, you're  wrong again.  When I first got in there,  before you guys tapped in,  you know, to listen to me killing  and bump up your...  All right.  So, psycho ex-girlfriend,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's get a new one on the  air here today.  Saved message, Wednesday, February 7th, 
[02:20:00]  10, 46 p.m.  Oh, and in the meantime,  actually, I probably have a date  tomorrow night.  So, you know, you don't need to  call me because you obviously  don't give a shit about me  anymore.  But I just thought I'd fill you  in and let you know that I have a  date tomorrow night with that  other guy.  He's been anxious to see me.  And he called again, by the way.  And this time he got me on my  cell phone.  And he got me. 
[02:20:30]  And, um, I told him I couldn't  talk.  I called him back.  And, um, I guess we're going out  tomorrow night.  So, it's a good way to end my stay  in Dallas.  At least I'll have some good  memories.  And, you know, at least I'll end  it with someone who actually  wanted to see me.  Imagine that.  I'm ill.  Interesting, huh?  Oh, and you know what?  You do need to lose a few pounds.  Hi.  Oh.  Little jab. 
[02:21:00]  She's fighting back now.  She's getting spunky.  And can I tell you, there's  nothing worse than, first of all,  when someone tries to manipulate  you, but someone who's as awful  at manipulation as she is,  she's just terrible at it.  I might see this other guy.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I'm going to go.  Yep.  Going to see another guy.  Get some happy memories.  Don't turn around and look right  now.  God, how old are you?  That never works.  Hey, am I back?  Not really.  I did mention you guys during  the first break when I first 
[02:21:30]  got in there.  Yeah.  So, that's where you're wrong.  And don't ever, ever think,  you could say, I'm not loyal.  You could say, I slobber, I  screw up words, and I'm stupid.  All right?  I'll go with those.  But when it comes to loyalty,  Rich Voss is number one.  Oh, you're so mean to Rich.  Rich, don't call back.  Don't do it to yourself.  Just don't. 
[02:22:00]  We all know that already.  He doesn't have to say that.  Yeah.  He knows that.  Yeah.  Voss is a good friend.  He shows up for dinner.  Hello?  I think we got cut off.  Yeah, you think that.  Guys, these damn cell phones.  Yeah, they're the worst, aren't they?  They are, Arnold.  Well, listen.  You had to see his face. 
[02:22:30]  Are you listening?  Yeah, yeah.  When I walked out, it was almost  like, it was almost like...  Are you a metal shop?  What's that?  What's going on?  Where are you?  A metal shop?  No, someone's fixing my teeth.  That's very good.  Oh, that was good.  Yeah, we all know that.  Let's relax.  All right, go ahead, Rich.  I can't explain the face.  It was almost like, you know,  you're out with a girl on a date,  but she knows she's not as good 
[02:23:00]  as the other girl.  Yeah.  And the other girl walks in.  Yeah.  That was the kind of face.  He was like, when he...  You know, because I walked  out of his studio  and I was talking to you guys  and then he said to me,  he goes, can you hear me?  Yeah.  He goes, hey, what's going on?  I go, hey, look, you know,  they're the breadwinners.  I got to talk to them first.  And to answer your question,  you know what it's like  when you're out on a date?  No, not really.  Come on, you do it.  You do all it.  Don't act like, you know,  you don't...  No, he got stood up last night. 
[02:23:30]  Not stood up, no,  but second to it.  What happened?  She worked things out  with her father  yesterday afternoon?  What's that?  She worked things out  with her father yesterday afternoon.  I don't have to get even  with anybody.  Sorry, Tim.  You know how bad that is  when a hooker stands you up?  No, the hooker came through  as they always do and will.  Well, who stood you up?  Do I know her?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, please, you're doing all right.  Once that show comes out... 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that's it.  That's right.  You need to go from  twos to four.  I'm telling you.  You're going to do all right.  Dude, look, I don't even care.  I had to prepare for my reading  with Chaz today.  I'm just saying  that other stuff is happening.  Oh, and by Chaz, you mean...  Oh, uh, Palmetto.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that guy.  Yeah, just got to go there.  Uh-huh.  Oh, cool.  Cool.  For a movie or for the show?  No, it's just for...  For Dove Davidoff  has a thing with him  and I'm just reading,  but it's not an audition.  They're parts I'm not right for  and I know it.  Why?  Why? 
[02:24:30]  Blubbery Nobody?  No, it's not for a Blubbery Nobody.  It's for an older comic,  like an old vaudeville guy.  It's just a wreath.  Table wreaths are not auditions.  They're different things.  Well, how does Dove  have anything to do with it?  He's got a show with him  or something.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Cool.  So, dude, who cares?  You got a show on HBO.  You're on fire.  I was saying that the other night.  Yeah.  You're on fire.  That's a lot of good.  All right, Rich, give the plug.  We've got to move on here.  I don't have any plugs.  No, you can plug.  You're down there in Baltimore, right?  Yeah, I'm at the Improv,  and I'll see you guys next week.  Bye, sweetie.  You know what we're doing 
[02:25:00]  when you come in next week?  Yeah, I think we're going over  trashing you guys on the radio,  your first...  Yeah, I got a copy  of the first radio show  Anthony and I did together,  and you and Norton  are going to just listen in  and smash us good.  Why do you got to do that one?  You just do last week's radio show.  I'm sure we could smash that.  That was kind of good.  I got to go, bud.  What's the thing?  Rich Voss, everyone.  All right, here's another call  from the psycho ex-girlfriend, Anthony.  Fade message. 
[02:25:30]  Wednesday, February, 7th, 10, 50 p.m.  Oh, and by the way,  since I'm probably going to be moving back,  I'm not going to be needing the cell phone.  And that actually works out perfect for me  because you know what?  I got a cell phone.  Part of my deal in signing it  was learning how to use it,  which was what was promised to me.  by their trusty account executive,  which I didn't get.  And you know what?  I don't care if they think I'm fucking crazy, 
[02:26:00]  but I don't even have a copy of the contract.  And you know what?  On top of it,  someone sold me something  and told me they'd teach me how to use it,  and they didn't.  And they were too busy boozing it up in the bars tonight.  So, I really don't want to have to call...  Mr. Burns, Mr. Jackass.  But I got the numbers here.  And I'd rather just have you end this amicably  and cancel my contract  and make sure I'm not filled with any charges. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not going to be here anyway.  And you know what?  You can stick the knife in and turn it  and try to screw me,  which I'm sure you will.  But I will fight it.  And I will make it to the point  where you don't...  You'll wish you didn't fight it.  Trust me.  Because I'm good at these things.  And, again,  I was promised service.  Okay?  That's the only reason I signed the contract.  And yes, you know what?  I was your girlfriend,  and that's why I did sign the contract. 
[02:27:00]  And you know what?  It was a pretty good deal.  But part of the deal  was learning how to use a fucking phone,  which I don't understand.  I don't want to have to learn out of a manual  and, you know,  take four hours out of my day  to figure it out and test it.  And you couldn't even figure it out last night.  I don't even know what my fucking password is  from my voicemail.  I got a voicemail in there,  and I don't know how to access my voicemail.  Okay?  So the service that I was promised  was not delivered.  And I don't care if you were my fucking boyfriend or not.  It wasn't delivered. 
[02:27:30]  I don't even have a fucking copy of the contract.  Okay?  So you know what?  Pick the knife in.  Turn it.  Screw me for $200  if you feel comfortable doing that.  But I will fight it.  Down to the wire.  And I will make people know  that you were too busy  boozing it up in the bars  to teach me how to do it.  And you didn't give a shit.  I've been asking you for days  to tell me how to do that.  And it's not a lie.  So there you have it.  Goodbye.  Wow.  I feel better, by the way.  Why? 
[02:28:00]  I know what happened.  She text messaged me  because she didn't know  how to use her cell phone.  See?  It was a contractual thing.  Not that I'm a loser piece of shit.  It could happen.  Contractual.  You were boozing it up in the bars, mister.  Boozing it up.  That's like one of those  awful general threats.  I'll tell the authorities!  The authorities.  I'll go to your superior!  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  She doesn't know  how to use her cell phone.  That's a...  That's...  Whatever.  Like the boyfriend's  like going to hear this 
[02:28:30]  and go,  oh my God,  she's right.  She has another contract.  She's going to call  Mr. Marshall.  Mr. Marshall.  All right.  I'm going to...  We'll play one more.  Sage message.  Wednesday,  February,  7th,  10,  54,  PM.  And by the way,  if you don't think  I'm going to call  Mr. Jackass.  First,  you got another thing coming.  Yeah,  they put those in?  Yeah,  for legal reasons  because,  I don't know.  Yeah.  That could have been a problem.  Oh,  that's a name cover  like the Jerky Boys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Mr. Bird.  Seems like he's worthless anyway.  I will call him  and I've given you  every opportunity,  every opportunity  to call me back.  He's ignored  countless voicemails  that I've given you  countless.  And you know what?  You don't give a shit  about me.  Obviously.  To the point where  I hurt myself tonight.  I was crying my eyes out.  I told you  that I needed a friend.  I told you  that I needed someone 
[02:29:30]  and I was going to  call my mother  and you completely  avoided that.  And you know what?  You don't give a flying  shit about me.  It's pretty damn evident.  So you know what?  Buckle up, sweetheart,  because you're in  for a ride  and if you don't think  I'll do it.  Trust me,  I will.  She's calm today.  I love the fact  that he recorded  this dumb bitch  and put her on the internet.  I really love this guy.  I love him. 
[02:30:00]  Because you have to,  I'm sure women  have to deal with this too,  but when you have to deal  with some self-obsessed  scumbag ex  who's just going to  pester you  and annoy you,  you should humiliate  them like that.  saved message.  Wednesday,  February,  7th,  10,  56,  EM.  I just don't feel  the need to tell you  that you are just  a worthless  fucking piece of crap  that I wasted  my life on  for six months  and I believed in  for six months? 
[02:30:30]  Six months,  is it?  This is a six-month  relationship?  Wow.  What a kook.  I wasted my life  on for six months.  Six months  and she's lost  her mind.  She met  when we went  back on the air.  Yeah.  And she's this nuts  already.  Wow.  That you would be  there for me  no matter what.  Oh yeah,  Joe,  I love you.  I'll be there.  I'll do anything  for you.  Well,  fuck you.  Because you know  what?  You haven't done  shit for me. 
[02:31:00]  And you know  what?  I hope you're  fucking happy  the way everything  worked out.  And I hope you  fucking saved  every fucking  voicemail  that you ever  got for me.  Because you know  what?  I do fucking  hate you.  And you  fucking tortured me.  You fucking tortured  me.  You're a fucking  piece of shit.  Wow.  You're replaying  this then.  Now it's getting  good.  We need another  one.  The next one's  long though.  Should we end  with one? 
[02:31:30]  We'll do one  more here.  Okay.  One more.  All right,  because we got  John's here.  John Senna.  Senna.  Senna.  John Senna.  Tell me  Senna.  Sorry,  John Senna.  He's the champion,  Anthony.  We're going to  talk to him  in a few  minutes here.  Saved message.  Wednesday,  February 7th,  11-05 p.m.  I'm good.  You're checking  all my voicemails  right now.  Well,  check this one.  You know,  and a final  thought before  I'm out of  here Friday.  I wanted to  tell you that  Mary and  Terry, 
[02:32:00]  Terry was  much more  get rid of  them.  Mary was  like,  well,  you know  what?  He's a  good guy.  You know,  he probably  didn't mean  much by it,  but if he does  it again,  don't even go  there.  And you  know what?  She was talking  about hurting  me.  And you  know what?  You hurt me  physically that  night, which was  crossing the line,  and you expect me  to be the perfect  girlfriend.  You pushed me to  the point where I  couldn't walk for  two weeks.  And that certainly 
[02:32:30]  put up the flags,  didn't it?  But, you know,  after that, I'm  supposed to be  loving and  understanding.  And that was  after you, even  after you broke  all the promises  that you made  to me.  So, you know,  here we are  again.  And you hurt  me emotionally  more than anyone  has ever done  in my entire  life.  I just want you  to know that.  So you've  definitely achieved  something, big boy.  You've hurt me  more than anybody  ever has.  And you know  what?  You were the  one person that  I thought would  be there for me.  Because, let me  tell you, you're 
[02:33:00]  not the easiest  person to get  along with either  yourself.  And I stuck it  out with you to  the very end  telling you that  I wanted to be  with you and I  wanted to work it  out.  When, you know  what?  Life stuck.  And you tortured  me.  And you knew  all my insecurities  and all my  weaknesses and you  play on them to  the point where  you went out for  drinks tonight.  You don't call  me back.  You don't  return my messages  when I'm  telling you how  desperate I am  and how I need  someone.  You ignore me.  And you know 
[02:33:30]  what?  Being ignored is  probably the worst  thing that you  could do to  anybody.  So, yeah, you  hurt me again.  And it's probably  not fixable at this  point.  And I know you  probably don't care  and you don't  give a shit about  me.  But I just want to  say that I really  had faith in you  and I really, really  thought you cared  about me.  And I guess I'm  calling you like a  madwoman because I  really thought that  you did.  And I find it  amazing that you  don't. 
[02:34:00]  You care so little.  And you are the  only person I have  here and you are  the only reason that  I stayed here.  Through all this  grief and all this  trouble and all of  my aloneness.  And you know what?  You capitalized on  that when we fought  up until the very  end.  And I'm out of  here.  So, I just hope  that you are happy  getting rid of me.  And you might be  tonight, but you  know what?  I hope in the long  run down the road 
[02:34:30]  as weeks and months  go by, I hope  you're happy with  that because you  know what?  I did everything I  could.  I've called you a  million times.  Not just tonight,  but every time this  has happened.  And there's not  much more that a  human being can do  and it's fucking  sad.  I should have  never, I don't  even know why,  why I would think  to put my trust in  you or someone  like you.  And you are a  miserable piece of 
[02:35:00]  shit in my world  and that's all  you've done for me  right now is make  me bitter and make  me upset and you've  tortured me.  So, you carry on  with that, okay?  When you check this  message, I'm sure  you'll still be  feeling good and  proud.  So, I just hope  that's what you  wanted because that's  what you got. 
[02:35:30]  That's it.  That's it.  This is number 22.  This bitch left  28 more of these.  28.  We're not even  halfway there.  28 more.  You gotta love her.  Babbling,  psycho.  Did anybody ever find  out who this guy is  or who she is?  There's been stories  all over the internet  about this.  Yeah, one is...  Well, she names  them there.  Matt?  Matt?  Her name is Joe of  some sort of  from Dallas?  Yeah.  Matt and Joe? 
[02:36:00]  Some guy emailed me  and said he knew the  guy, Matt, and that  he was a real dirtbag.  And I deleted his  email by accident.  So, if that guy's  listening, if he could  resend that, he swears  he has all sorts of  info on the guy.  I'd love to know.  Yeah, and then other  people say it was a  hoax.  Right.  But I've checked  into the whole thing  too.  You get some people  going, oh, it's been  exposed as a hoax.  There's one guy that  said it was a hoax.  One guy who has this  thing on...  Well, you look at his  name and the domain  name registration has a 
[02:36:30]  fake street address and  phone number.  Everybody that has a  website doesn't put  their real address or  phone number in there.  You put any street,  USA, and then you  don't put a real  contact number so you  don't have fucking  lunatics calling you.  Who cares?  People are like, oh,  it's been exposed as a  hoax.  No, it hasn't.  There's one guy that  claimed that he did  all this investigating  and said it was a  hoax.  But the guy never came  forward and said it  was a hoax.  The calls, if you ask  me, are much too 
[02:37:00]  realistic.  No one would need an  Academy Award.  Yes.  You could tell when  it's like it has that  phony sound to it.  Because she went  too far on the phone.  She went to...  She didn't...  Nothing...  It was like all  about the phone.  That's the type of  shit you do when you  really want to slice  her own throat.  She really...  This is...  Unless she's...  If she's an Oscar  winner, maybe.  Yeah.  Well, it's  Meryl Streep.  There you go.  Doris from  Virginia.  What's up?  Doris?  Hello, you?  Hello?  Modern name... 
[02:37:30]  Psycho girlfriend  story from Virginia.  Doris.  Maybe the name is  wrong.  I'm going out with  Doris tonight.  Everyone that's on  hold, say hi.  Doesn't sound like  any connection there.  No connection.  That is weird.  Maybe the phones  are messed up.  Are they?  Let's give it  in the shot.  Viola?  Viola.  Viola and Doris?  Where the hell are we  broadcasting to?  What's up?  You're broadcasting  to somebody that lives  in Oklahoma that  drives a truck.  Oh, right on.  All I wanted to 
[02:38:00]  say was the guy  that had to listen  to all these voice  messages was probably  just hearing blah,  blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what most  guys hear.  Well, they're not  going to listen to  that psychobabble stuff  for too long.  Exactly.  Anyway, I'm  punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We should take a  break.  John Cena is here  from the WWE.  Anthony is going  to make his  entrance in a few  minutes here.  Right.  I guess TV is  filming this. 
[02:38:30]  What do they got  cameras and stuff?  Yeah, the WWE  film crew is here.  Okay.  So we'll talk to  John Cena next.  Oh, j**t.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  I got your f**k.  Shut your mouth.  I love the  homoerotic nature  of the whole event.  The virus made  my genitals rot off.  Oh, dude,  don't come near me.  We're your celebrity  skin cancer connection.  And it was better  than my first kiss.  Laugh until your  energy spill out 
[02:39:00]  on the chair.  The Anthony Show.  Stealing roses  and disappearing  into mold  as a dry mouth.  Breaking into  hard knocks  stealing our  intentions.  And the  sitting  with the  oil  crying  later.  And the  terror of  salvation.  Still you  feed a slice  from the  pillowcloth.  the  water.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Everybody's going to the party  have a real good time.  Dancing in the desert  blowing up the sunshine.  System  Nice  Hey  Opiatico peepee  Let me try it  Did he wet?  System of a down  Opin Anthony program  Very good Jimmy

They don't want the riffraff  Coming from downstairs  From the street 
[02:41:00]  Oh that's right  They have to pass like three guards  Before they can even get up here  Who's gonna know  To come from the street  Hey let's go to that fancy piano building  And take a shit on the fifth floor  George Costanza would know  Besides him  You laughed  There was a fan in the men's room yesterday  There was a guy  I went in the men's room  There was a guy in our men's room  Oh he was looking for Jimmy  I heard like a drill noise  A little hole popped in  A hole  Then a mouth  A little eyeball  Hello  Anytime  The reason for it in New York  Is because of women getting attacked  In the bathroom  Didn't that happen in the 70's or something 
[02:41:30]  We're in the 70's  Yeah  In the 70's  Yeah  Maybe in Central Park  And people was in Jersey  And I'm whacking my bag  And there's a hole in it  And I didn't notice  And I heard  Psst  And I saw  I saw a pink tongue  And black lips  Like sliding  It was so dark  And it was awful  Psst  Perhaps you'd enjoy  The Black Rock Coalition  Wow man  So I don't know  If the keys are missing  It becomes a problem around here 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  It really irritates me  Should we get John Cena in here or what?

[02:43:30]  Very nice  Moseying through another day here  Trying to just make it through today  Met fan though?  Believe it or not  I'm actually a Red Sox fan  Yet I'm wearing a 1986 Dwight  Yeah why?  Are you insane?  I can't wear a Yankees jersey  I can't  So whatever city you're in  You've got to try to wear the city's uniform  Oh okay  But it can't be a Yankee  Because you're a Sox fan  Because I'm a Sox fan  You're a real Sox fan or one from this year?  No no I'm a real Sox fan  You're from the Boston area right? 
[02:44:00]  I'm right outside of Boston  It's a town called West Newberry  Yeah  Well we used to be up there  Doing a little something something  We worked at WAF  For real  Oh it was just  Not just because Boston won  But because the Yankees  So sucked and choked  And it's just awful  You know the Yankees  26 World Championships  39 pennants  But when you look in the record book  About the only team  To ever lose  After being up 3-0 in a series  Yeah I know  The mighty mighty pinstripes  You know  It made me very happy  It did  Oh stop it  It made me very happy 
[02:44:30]  Stop it  I'm a Mets fan first  Bandwagon jumper  No I'm a Mets fan first  And then Sox before Yankees  I can't stand it  Because now everyone you see  Has got a B on their hat  They're all  So many  Now there's so many  Bandwagon jumpers  You're right  You're right  You're right  Stop it  I was watching 86  So you can be easy  Over there as a Mets fan  I'm surprised you would  See the Sox fans are insane  That they will never wear  A Yankee jersey  Yet they put on a Mets jersey 
[02:45:00]  I put on a Doc Gooden jersey  Completely embarrassed  Aside from this Yankee choke  That's the biggest choke ever  Yeah but now it's okay  You know  You can all remember  And laugh about it  They don't even care about  Oh they can laugh about it  You took my heart  That was great  Now Billy Buckner's a hero  They don't care about  Billy Buckner anymore  It's all good now  We got the ring  It's all good  That movie though  Fever Pitch  I haven't seen it  Oh it's awful  It is awful  It stinks  I heard about it  And I heard  They were doing  The stuff in Fenway 
[02:45:30]  And I just  I  What wrecked the movie  You know the Sox  Weren't supposed to win  The championship  Yeah of course  So then they win the damn thing  So they have to redo  The ending of the movie  And I don't know  It just  It was awful  I was hoping for a pretty good movie  You know being from Boston  And all that  Or doing some time up there  Hoping for a good movie  I don't know  That had chick flick written  All over it  Well it was a date movie  It was a date movie  Huh  Fallon's like a Sox guy  He's not bad  Like he's been a Boston supporter  And just  I haven't seen the movie  But I've heard that it's  No here's the weird thing  With Jimmy Fallon  Because he does the great Boston accent 
[02:46:00]  On SNL  When he was doing that  Right  He starts with the good Boston accent  And fever pitch  And then just says  Ah screw it  And just like  Talks normally  Halfway through the movie  Just drops  Not even  It's like after the first scene or two  I'm like what are you doing  You do that accent pretty well  I will not see that  No  Well let's talk a little bit about  The champ  Yeah let's talk  The champ  Let's talk something about  We've kind of like  Lost touch  It's time for re-education guys  There's a lot going on  Well I gotta tell you 
[02:46:30]  Yes  Slowly but surely  We're getting  Reintroduced to wrestling  We're getting hooked again John  We used to have all the guys  On the show  Back at NAW  Before we got the boot  Before we booted off the air  For a couple of years  And then during that two years  We really kind of lost touch  Why don't we let him in on a few things  Triple H before he got married  Used to come into our show  And spank chicks  Spank chicks  Spank chicks  All the time  So red  Yeah  Our show was legendary  For some of these guys  Yeah  A lot of fun  Had the rock on  The Dudley boys  I heard the Dudley boys 
[02:47:00]  Were your first guests  Weren't they?  No  First WWE guests?  Nah  I think we got a real sap  The first time  I think we got a real nobody  Oh man it was bad  Sorry about that  Maybe we got the Brooklyn brawler  Oh man  Wow old school  That guy  I was like okay  Why are you  And then one time  I got choked out by  Stevie Richards in Boston  At the River Rafe  For real  The video was up on our website  For a long time  Wow  He messed me up pretty good  I tried to help out Opie  And he swatted me 
[02:47:30]  Like I was just  Just got you out of there  A fly  He was nothing  Yeah  And yeah  We had  Who brought us our tickets  To Wrestlemania  When it was in Anaheim  Ivory  Was it Ivory?  Yeah Ivory  Wow yeah  So we had  We've had the guys on  And then I don't know  Something happened somewhere  And we just lost interest  Yeah we got thrown off the air  Oh was that what happened I guess  And then lately though  We're getting back into it  We're slowly but surely  Getting the guys back in  Triple H has been on  And a few of the other guys  Now whose ass did you hand to them?  John Bradshaw Layfield 
[02:48:00]  And his whole contingent  He runs around with a whole group  Called The Cabinet  The Cabinet  I've been serving them all  For a couple months now  We have a big giant  End all be all  I quit match  On May 22nd  Really?  To pretty much decide  Not only who is the champ  But who pretty much quits  And who doesn't  But I really want to see  The guy quit  Oh trust me  I'm going to make something happen  There's always some kind of loophole  You know what  And they always find  The red tape in the contract  They always somehow come back 
[02:48:30]  I want to see where the guy  Actually quits  And that's it  And that's it  He's done  Forget about it  That's it over  He has to go get a regular job  And then the crew  Follows him around  And laughs at him  Because he lost his great opportunity  Do you get along with the McMahon family?  I think they're great  Honestly they're great  Vince is a great guy  Steph is unbelievable  As far as the function of our program  Shane has got more energy  Than I've ever seen  Out of one human being in my life  But Vince is a real cool dude  What about the son-in-law?  You get along with  Hey man he's on a different show 
[02:49:00]  I've never even seen him  I'm on Smackdown  He's on Raw  So we never kind of cross paths  Really?  Yeah  Never kind of see each other  Honestly we see each other  At pay-per-views  And every once in a while  In passing  And he's  I mean  It's been nothing but good so far  Yeah  So I'm all good I guess  I don't know if I'm a Mark man  Or whatever  But it's all good so far  And you did the white rap thing right?  Yeah man  That's what we're doing  That's what we're doing  The white rap thing  Well what else do you call it?  Well I mean  It is what it is  Why can't it just be the rap thing?  Exactly  Why do you have to put people in categories?  Because immediately you see it  And it's like okay  Sticking out like a sore thumb 
[02:49:30]  Exactly  Yeah  So yes that's what I do  You've done it for years though  Yeah it's one of those things where  After WWE introduced me  They introduced me as a smiling white meat baby face  You know  Smile to the people type of guy  Yeah  And I just grew up with hip hop  Like this is how I dress  This is how I act  This is what I do  So after they got to know me  And after they familiarized themselves  They were just like  Hey you want to try this on TV?  And it was a total joke at first  Like I mean  Yeah  Huge costumes  And it was like way over the top 
[02:50:00]  But every time I got the mic  I did my own little thing  And after a while  They were like okay  You can start dressing how you want  You can start acting how you want  And you know  It kind of snowballed  And now we're just  We're doing big things man  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Performing a lot around the country  Yeah I mean  You know WWE  250 shows a year  Does never stop  52 weeks  No reruns  Right  So we're on a whirlwind tour  Jericho's got his thing going  Yeah  But the thing with Jericho  Is he's  Fozzie's been out for a while  Yeah  So they have a lot of music  That the people are familiar with

[02:53:30]  You know that's  That's what it's supposed to be about  So we wanted to just do  Something different  Because I'm tired of  Big rims  I'm tired of expensive champagne  I'm tired of you know  Thugs and all that  That's  That's the funk  That videos have been in  So we just try to do  Something a little different  Throw a little different flavor at you  You worked with Mr. T right?

Oh not much  How are you going  ONA?  Alright  And Phil Jimmy?  Hi Tim  Yeah I want to say that  John  I think you're one of the best wrestlers out there  I watched wrestling for years  And I just would like to see you whip JBL's ass  In that I quit match  He will be screaming I quit 
[02:55:30]  Barring all the loopholes  I'm sure he will find some sort of dastardly loophole to come back  But he will be screaming I quit I guarantee that  I'm rooting for JBL  Somebody's got to root for the other guy  What that redneck?  Nah  He has to go down  Jimmy the Trucker by the way  Calling JBL a redneck  JBL is  He's good with the stocks right?  Yeah yeah  He's a more money now type of guy  Well we're eating it on this one stock  And I think we need JBL on the show to help us out with that situation  Yeah  Please  Well yeah he's a good guy 
[02:56:00]  You know  Wrestling and stuff  But what he said out there  When you guys were overseas  Visiting the troops for Christmas  You know  And the big show came out there and said  Hey  Hey  Do you think all these people are out here rooting for you?  No no no  You guys are out there supporting the troops  And I think you guys do a hell of a good job out there  Supporting our troops out there  And I give you 100% on that  Thank you very much my man  I appreciate that  So you guys keep it rocking  I'm punching out  Alright let's go to Jake in New York 
[02:56:30]  Jake what's up?  Hey what's up ONA  What's up Cena?  Hey what's up man?  That was just a  That was a classic delay  I didn't know you wanted an answer  Well  Not much today there  Long time fan of both you guys  And I was just wondering  What's up with the censorship  With the Ruck Fools  You can't wear that stupid t-shirt on UPN  Dude here's something I came up with  I was actually watching the campaign program  During the election  And I saw a sweet sign 
[02:57:00]  That said Buck Fush  I was like yeah that's kind of hot  So I came out with a whole line of clothing  Hats and shirts that say  Ruck Fools  And it doesn't say anything bad  It is what you make of it  Right  But UPN is a program we aired on  And they hated on it  I couldn't wear the hats  It always got blurred  I couldn't do anything like that  Really?  So it was something I was really about  Because I mean I thought it was catchy  I thought it was cool  It looked pretty good  But it ended up getting nipped in the bud  And now they won't let me wear my own stuff on TV  UPN  That's UPN  Ah they've gone 
[02:57:30]  Big thumbs down to the censorship thing  They've gone too far man  They've gone too far  Everyone freaked out with the Janet Jackson thing  Oh my god I got killed  Usually I'm on the mic talking trash  I can't even speak anymore  Yeah  And now back in the older days  You used to be able to get away with a lot on mic  You burst the hands  Yeah  Yeah  You know  You're pretty much seeing tits on television  Pretty much  And then the language was great  You know  Yeah it was  I liked that  It was just  It was right to the point where  Right  It was just enough  Yep  You know it was racy enough 
[02:58:00]  And it was  It was  It was  On the line  You could say things like  Kick your ass  Yeah  Son of a bitch  And things like that  It was fine  It was entertaining  You know  But now it's different  It's all changed  Wow they clamped down  What else have they told you  You can't do anymore  Because of the Janet Jackson thing  Or the wrestling in general  I would say  They tell us to stay away from lewd gestures  They tell us to obviously  You can't even like  In the ring under your breath curse  Because if they pick it up  Like reading your lips  Uh huh  That's a major league foul  Obviously out in the ring  There's nothing that you can even go close to 
[02:58:30]  As far as a curse word  You can't say son of a bitch  If you say ass  They'll be on you  Like a pack of wolves  It's very very  And uh  Our Monday show  Raw is a little bit different  Because they start at 9  And go to 11  Right  We start at 8  And go to 10  So at that 9 o'clock hour  We can maybe  Change it  But for that first hour man  It's like  Saturday morning cartoons  I thought we were going  Like in a direction  Where Vince would have been like  You motherfucker  Like now that would have been good  It was getting  Get up to that point  It was getting close  Yeah we were going to switch to HBO 
[02:59:00]  That's awful man  We hate seeing that obviously  We're loving being on satellite radio  Where we just let it fly  Obviously  Uh Shwoogie what's up  Hey guys how you doing  Hey man  Hey John  Big Ben to your work man  And breathe some fresh air  Into a stale product over there  Thank you very much man  I appreciate it  My question is  There's a lot of talk  You may be going over to Raw  Whether that's accurate or not  I don't know  But if you do  Are you ready to be held down  By the vortex  That is Triple H's  Insecurity  Dude you know  This is something  This is the guy  That cannot stand  With Triple H  Yes  And this is  You know why 
[02:59:30]  Because it ruins  Speak on it  Speak on it man  Speak on it  Yeah you've got to  Explain yourself Shwoogie  Because I'm  There are fans listening  That don't know  We're finally picking up  On the pattern here man  Yeah speak on it  Every wrestler we have on  He goes after Triple H  Triple H  You know he's a good wrestler  Without a doubt  I mean his skills  Have eroded over the last  Couple of years  But he's still a very good wrestler  However if you notice  You follow a pattern  It's believed that  He wants to beat  Flair's goal  Of holding the belt  17 times  That's why you have  All these short term champions 
[03:00:00]  He does anything  It appears that he does  Anything possible  To hold down  Other wrestlers  Whether it be  You know Benoit  Who's very over with  Who was very over with  The fans  You have Batista  Who's somewhat over  And that jury's still out  On that  But you know  Mark by words  He's wrestling  The next Raw pay-per-view  In a Hell in a Cell match  But what you were saying  Last time was that  He's always trying to  Get involved with the champion  In some way  No no  Overshadow  Bookie 101 
[03:00:30]  Says that  It should always be  The champion  Who's centered on a promotion  Since Triple H  Has lost the belt  Everything still revolves around him  Opens the show  This week he did something  Where he walked off the show  It's always  Had something to do with him  And it's basically  With a stroke  That he has  Within the company  Take a look at  I mean  Going back  From Eugene  Which granted  Was a one  Was a one joke character  Which could have been  Fleshed out  They never did  He got hurt  He put him down 
[03:01:00]  Why is Triple H  Bothering when he  Wrestled Ross  A couple weeks ago  It just doesn't make  Any sense  As I listen to this  I mean  You make some good points  But I'm thinking  That Vince is a  Smart enough businessman  If this was  Something that would  Hurt business  That he would make sure  It wouldn't continue  It definitely  Oh  It definitely  Hurt business  I'm just playing  The other side  That's all  The second  You take a look  At some of the  You take a look  At some of the house shows  They don't draw  In major markets  They're in front of  4,000 or 5,000 people  From the smaller markets  I think wrestling went down  There for a while  Because they did lose 
[03:01:30]  The edge  Especially after the  Jazz action thing  No they never really  Lost the edge  We lost a lot of guys  At once  Austin left  Rocky left  Foley left  We had to change  We had to change  Our company name  We had to XFL  Very few people  On the Raw brand  Were ever allowed  To step up  You know  It's one of those  Things man  Where I've been  I've been fortunate  Enough to find  A good home  On Smackdown  The only time  I've ever been  On Raw  Was for the draft  Last year  And honestly man  It's one of those  Things where  You're preaching  Almost conspiracy  Theory over there 
[03:02:00]  But I don't know  Because I ain't seen it  I don't say conspiracy  Theory  I just think that  You know  You have someone  Who is married  To the boss's daughter  No matter what  Anyone wants to say  That definitely  Plays into it  At the worst  A little bit  You got it  Because you got  The boss's ear  At Thanksgiving dinner  At that very same time  But John  I know you can't  Admit it  For obvious reasons  No dude  This is XM Radio  Ain't no censorship  No no not a doubt  But you know  What I'm talking about  I know you can't  Admit it  He's going to  You know  What's up man 
[03:02:30]  And you know  That I'm correct  Dude have you ever  Have you ever known  John Cena to hold  His tongue  Absolutely not  But John  I know you're not  Going to hold  I know you're  Going to hold  Your tongue  If it means your job  That's not true  Man  That's absolutely  Not true  I mean come on  Fun  You want to do it  Start spouting  About JBL  And how he's  The enforcer  Over at Smackdown  And some of the  Outrageous things  That he's done  Start spouting  Off about Holly  And how he's  Roughing up the rookies  About what  What do you mean  Oh who was that  Who was it 
[03:03:00]  That he did  To the guy  Who screwed up  His rental car  You ever seen  Bob Holly  Wrestle in any match  He roughs up  Any person  He's in between  The ropes with  John  Wow  You're way  Into wrestling  No no  I mean it's good  This is fact  This guy's spitting knowledge  It was one of the  Homie  I hate to break it to you  But we rent cars  Everywhere we go  No no no  The guy who didn't  Return his rental car  Busted his eye in the ring  The guy ran  Literally scared for his life  Back to the  Back to the dress  So what was the scenario 
[03:03:30]  Somebody didn't  The guy didn't  Return his rental car  He got a whole bunch  Of tickets  He was pretty pissed off  Okay so let me play  This out for you  There was a dude  And I may have been  Doing the movie thing  So I don't know  If I was there for this  But this  This guy didn't  Return his rental car  Which is it  Hold on  I'm just going to  Lay this out for you  Homie  This guy didn't  Return his rental car  Which is an extra charge  He got a bunch of tickets  Which means they're  Going on  Hardcore's insurance  And you expect him  Not to do anything  Oh come on John  You know as well as I do  When you have someone  In the ring  You're responsible  For that person 
[03:04:00]  Dude I know  When you got somebody  In the ring  If you got business  To settle  You settle your business  Do you really  Yeah  That's what I know  You give them a little extra  You give them a little extra  You know what  If they don't give back  They don't give back  It's not that  Anybody's beating up  On anybody man  It's done  That was a total mug  If it was done outside  The guy would have been arrested  What about Matt Capitelli  What you got to realize man  Is that we're in a physical business  Oh I understand that  But I also know  That you also protect  The most important thing  And tell me if I'm wrong  Is that when you're in there  Number one goal  Is to protect your partner  At all times  When you're in there 
[03:04:30]  The number one goal  Is to protect the business  And if somebody's playing  You file and you got  An issue to settle it  That's where you settle it  And that's real talk  Right there  What about the issue  With Matt Capitelli  I thought that was going down  Oh man  Alright Shwoogie  We got to give someone else  A chance  Thanks guys  Thanks man  Guy will babble for hours  No but that's knowledge man  That'll give us some knowledge  To the fans  Oh he's just an idiot  I think this is Lily  Lily, Illy  What's your name  In Boston there  It's Illy  Illy what's up  Man Shwoogie  Wrestling is not for real  I know  WWE 
[03:05:00]  You know what I'm saying  Oh man  Dude is like  Taking it to a whole  Different level  Man  What's his book in 101  Like he's writing  The textbook to this  But you know  I can't hate on him  Because we have such  A strong fan base  And our fans are so  Passionate about the product  A lot of times  They do get caught up  Or whatever  And our product  Is such a soap opera  As is  Yeah  That they like to go  That extra mile  Like you'll be going  Through the grocery store  And on top of the soap operas  You'll pick up soap opera  Digest  Whatever  Whatever  Like there's always  Going to be that atmosphere 
[03:05:30]  Because of what we do  Has so much drama  I like the real live  Soap opera stuff though  Yeah  That's right  Like the Matt Hardy  Lead  Oh man  You had to  You had to speak on that  Speak on it  We had Matt on the phone  Speak on it  And he went off  About the whole thing  And it's  You know  That's the real life  Now this is  This is another thing  That I caught  Because I'm on  Obviously I'm on  The wrong show  I gotta move to the other show  Man  It seems like  It's all happening over there  Please brief me  What happened  There is some stuff going on  What do you say  Well apparently  Edge moved in on  On Hardy's chick 
[03:06:00]  She's hot  And uh  Well  She's hot  She is  I ain't gonna lie  And then I think  What Matt was saying  Was in order to  Matt's my boy man  Matt's my boy  I've been going with Matt  Like Matt was one of the ones  When I first came in  He took good care of me  Like he made sure  I was doing alright  And everything  So  Yeah  I honestly didn't get to hear  Much about him  They were saying  In order to keep the peace  They kind of threw his ass  Out of there  Which you know  Sounds a little weird  That does sound a little weird  Because Matt  At the end of the day  Matt sold tickets  And Matt was an entertaining dude  I know Matt's coming off an injury 
[03:06:30]  And I know there's two sides  To every story  Yeah  Unfortunately I can't speak  On the other side  I know if you talk to Matt  He's obviously gonna give you his side  Which is  Oh he did  How it is  And Matt shoots straight  You know  So I guarantee  That was some interesting  He did  What scares me is that  John Cena goes  But she's hot dude  She's  John Cena is the type of guy  If he wants your girlfriend  There's nothing you can do about it  Oh no  You just have to sit there  And go  Oh man  She's hot  She's in a public eye  Try to stand up for myself  I know Matt's listening 
[03:07:00]  Matt I ain't hating on you man  She's hot  You know what I'm saying  That's period  Point blank  And at the end of the day  Takes two to tango  I'll just hit you with a belt  And you'll be laying there  Yeah I'll get waffled with a chair  Can you imagine  Everything's going well  With your chick  And John Cena decides  He needs to bang her  There's nothing you can do  You have to hold her personal  Holy fucks  And hope he doesn't punch you  In the face  After he's done  Oh god  Let's go to Bruno  From Utah  See what Bruno has today  Bruno  Yeah  What's up man  How's it going ONA

[03:14:00]  And I want you to say hello to the bad, bad man, come on 
[03:14:30]  With a mic in my hand, I'm a bad man, even in the fight with my hands, I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man, with the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man, even in the fight with the hands, I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man  Hey, what's that? 
[03:15:00]  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it, you can fuck it, you can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it, you can chase it, you can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, 
[03:15:30]  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  A little taste of COC, I noticed. 
[03:16:00]  Corrosion of conformity.  We got Pepper from COC coming in to say hi tomorrow.  Stephen Lynch coming in tomorrow.  Stephen Lynch tomorrow.  Nice.  He hasn't been around in a while.  That will be a lot of fun.  He has requested alcohol.  Yeah, he wants to know if he can drink at 8.30 in the morning.  Of course he can.  Of course.  Hey, Stephen Lynch.  Who can't?  All right.  We could go in a couple directions here, Anthony.  We got more psycho ex-girlfriend calls.  People are requesting those.  Or we could just rest that until tomorrow. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, maybe tomorrow.  All right.  We have an old lady talking about giving a blowjob.  Ooh!  And we have Nancy Reagan on Good Morning America.  What was Nancy talking about?  She was in Washington during that whole little scare they have with the aerial plane.  Yeah, well, she...  They had to evacuate her to the bunker with Mrs. Bush.  She's talking about, you know, the death of Ronnie and all that.  How long ago was that?  Eight months, I think.  A while ago. 
[03:17:00]  I think eight months, maybe.  Nine months ago.  I'm not sure.  It's like her first public appearance?  Yeah, pretty much.  It's the end of the morning?  Yeah, pretty much.  She's making the talk show circuit to talk about it now.  Yeah, great.  What's she going to say?  Has she been on Larry King yet?  Oh.  We're here with Nancy Reagan.  Here she is, the first time getting together with anyone after eight months of her husband  being dead.  Nancy Reagan.  Exclusively on CNN. 
[03:17:30]  Well, the old lady talking about the blowjob.  What is that?  Yeah.  What is that one?  Is that that sexpert?  Have you seen this lady?  She's like a grandma.  She's got a little angle, though.  She's a sexpert.  What's her angle?  She's a grandma with glasses, and she does like a...  Did Dr. Ruth do that?  Well, I saw Dr. Ruth the other day walking the streets in my neighborhood.  Yeah, man, is she...  Fucker.  She's short.  Yeah, she's a little thing.  I can't imagine anyone having sex with her, actually.  But she seems to be the expert, right? 
[03:18:00]  Apparently, she doesn't have sex.  No, there's a new one.  I don't know her name.  She does this show.  She's a grandma.  She's like a hip grandma, and she talks about sex.  No such thing.  Do you know who I'm talking about?  What, buddy?  The hip grandma sex therapist, surrogate sex expert.  I know who she is, but I don't know her name.  She has like kind of curly gray hair, glasses.  She's a grandma.  She's hip.  Why do you want to listen to her?  What is she on Lifetime or something?  I think she might be on Lifetime.  Lifetime?  One of those channels.  And she has frank discussions about sex, Anthony.  But Lifetime doesn't allow that, do they? 
[03:18:30]  I don't know what...  It's pretty graphic.  Somebody help me out there.  I mean, we have a...  Help me.  We have a ton of listeners.  Somebody out there knows the name of that.  Yeah, I know who you mean.  I don't know her name.  We got a clip from her show talking about a blowjob.  Listen to this.  Oh, honey, honey.  Don't take the whole penis in your mouth.  This is not what you do.  You don't take this whole penis in your mouth.  You're going to gag for sure.  And what is wrong with that?  Oh, this old bag doesn't know what she's talking about already.  She can't take it. 
[03:19:00]  You don't spit on it and make it wet and fun.  Just look at it and lick it.  What's wrong with a little...  Nothing.  Never, never.  Look, the sensitive part of the penis is right there and right around there and right around  the tip here.  Oh, stop it.  This old bag of meat doesn't know what she's talking about.  A blowjob isn't a blowjob if I'm not picking ham out of my pubes.  Her name is Sue Johnson. 
[03:19:30]  Thank you, Dave, from Wisconsin.  That is awful.  The head is sensitive, but if someone just sucks my head, it's like, ah, ah, ah, I back  up, cut it out.  You know something?  I'll let you in on a little something here, ladies.  It's not just about the head.  It's not just the tip.  The whole...  The best part is if they're just paying attention to the tip is then all of a sudden the whole  thing just being done.  All of a sudden, wah.  Yeah, it's like...  Wah. 
[03:20:00]  Whose sound?  I have given you an image.  Like a...  Kind of like a trombone.  Trombone going for that long note all of a sudden.  Yeah, you could be up top.  You know, you need the high notes.  You need some coverage. 
[03:20:30]  That's hilarious.  Get some coverage.  This woman is...  She don't know what she's talking about.  No, she certainly doesn't.  What a surprise.  An old bag doesn't know how to give head.  And you've got to use the hand.  The hand has to be there.  And I like it wet.  I like it sloppy.  It's got to be wet.  Now I'm hearing it's Sue Johansson, not Johnson.  Let's go to Chris real fast.  Chris?  Yeah.  It's, uh, uh, Johansson?  Yeah, Sue Johansson.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And when you're having sex, since the head is only the sensitive part, just let him stick 
[03:21:00]  it that far in.  And just have him pump away like that.  Because, uh, men don't get any pleasure out of sinking it deep.  And as soon as you get that tasty treat, stop.  Stop.  Well, that's kind of true.  Unless you know how to back off a lot.  Sue Johansson, yes.  Yes, it's on the Oxygen Network.  All right, well, let's, uh, let's go back to the tape here.  This has some sensitivity, yeah, but not, not all that much. 
[03:21:30]  So, you're going to perform oral sex on him?  Then you can lick and kiss and suck and do whatever you like and do that up the shaft  of the penis and along the side and around to his testicles?  Hey, no problem.  And then you take just the head of his penis in your mouth.  That's all.  And you drool great quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  Good call. 
[03:22:00]  And then you grip the penis very gently with your hand and you coordinate hand-mouth movements.  So, it's like that.  He just keeps saying he wants a deep throat, deep throat, you know?  Well, if he wants deep throat, then let him use the dildo.  That's too simple.  That's a good one.  Okay.  There we go.  I'll have to tell him that one.  Thank you, Bill.  Absolutely.  You're welcome.  Have a good night.  I will.  You too.  Horrible advice.  Horrible advice from this lady. 
[03:22:30]  And this guy is going to go search out his deep throat, BJ.  Although the drool part was actually very, very, uh, sexy.  I'll say.  Oh.  And pop your teeth out.  Just pop them right out of your head.  I'm looking at a picture of her.  She isn't even a remotely, like, sexy grandma.  None of them are.  She is just an old bag.  Oh.  I bet she was a real hoot back in 1935.  35?  45, maybe?  The 20s. 
[03:23:00]  Wow.  She's got hair like a guy, though.  Oh.  They all do.  Like the receding curly hair thing.  She does.  She's got what amounts to a gray Richard Simmons do.  It is exactly like Richard Simmons' hair on her head.  All gray.  She's got the granny glasses.  And she's just, she's an old lady.  Yeah.  Talking very graphically about blowjob.  Let's go back to Wisconsin.  There's like three places just fighting it out on the show today.  Oklahoma.  Actually, four.  Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey, just want to tell you, a reformed Howard Stern listener.  Totally, totally into your show.  It's great.  Thank you, sir.  You know why?  Because we're still having fun over here.  Yeah, even though Howard just discovered everything.  I love when Anthony does the whole, whoa.  Discovered America.  I was on the ships that came over, Robin.  It was me.  Lady, I've caught this show, and I've been laying in bed with my wife, and it's a freaking 
[03:24:00]  trainer.  You cannot turn away.  It's numbing to watch your grandmother talking about anal penetration.  It's just hardcore.  And the other thing she's got that's really funny is she'll pull out, like, dolls and  do sex positions.  With dolls?  With dolls.  Like, little, like, you know, I got kids that have these little, like, G.I. Joe dolls.  She's got a man and a woman, you know, anatomically correct, and she'll put them in positions.  Wow, I got to see this, I guess. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, we should be taping this show all the time now, Eric.  This will be a new feature on the show.  We got to get more clips of this lady.  And the other thing she does is she pulls out a bag, every day she has, like, a bag  of tricks, or every, I've seen two of them, but anyway, she pulls out a bag of tricks  and she reviews the toys.  Like, she'll say, this is kind of hard, this one feels really good.  Like, she's using them.  She's using them?  Or is somebody else using them and she's kind of giving a review?  Because I don't get any of these old lady sex experts, like her or Dr. Ruth or any of 
[03:25:00]  the other ones, that say that they're still having sex.  And I don't buy it.  It's all a Canadian.  She must be out of Canada because all the people that call in are all from, you know,  Canada.  So, I don't know.  Anyway, punch it out.  See ya.  Yeah, she's definitely from Canada.  Thanks for that call.  Let's go to Don.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I was just saying, man, I don't know of any guys out there.  I know I certainly don't.  When I'm fucking jacking it, man, I play with more than just the head. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, you don't have to, according to this word.  Yeah, it's like how many guys jacking it, just sit there and twist the top.  Yeah, that feels good.  I could not think of any person that could know less about the penis than an old lady.  I agree.  Like, she is the last person you would ask about a penis and what people that own them  enjoy having done to them.  Yeah, ladies, you've got to play like a trombone, man.  That's what I said.  She said you kissed the shaft. 
[03:26:00]  I mean, that's cool you lick it, but she forgot the taint.  What's better than having the taint licked and having maybe a finger put in there while  a girl yells, you like that, faggot?  I mean, something along those lines.  I thought that was obvious.  Yeah, who doesn't know that?  By the way, I want to take this moment to acknowledge Anthony's brilliant line once again.  Oh, God, that was funny.  The China line about sticking four fingers in and thumb wrestling.  I bow to you today, Anthony.  You conjured up an image.  I bow to you. 
[03:26:30]  Thank you, sir.  You had the whole place on the floor.  You know, people don't realize in Radioland there was like 10, 15 people in here, and  everyone just went for that falling-to-the-floor laugh type of thing.  I wouldn't want to do that.  Shane, let's see, from Jersey.  Shane, what's up?  I wonder who's listening to this old fucking dinosaur, man.  Yeah, I think it would be entertaining.  Entertaining to watch.  Yeah.  You know, to see an old lady, but not to take her advice.  Especially if she had to demonstrate her techniques at gunpoint on a large gentleman. 
[03:27:00]  All right.  We're going to have a lot more clips from her tomorrow, right, Eric?  Baby powder coming out of her panties and stuff.  Diapers, old June Allison Hummer.  Cloud of dust comes out of there.  Orthopedic white shoes so her fucking foot bones don't hurt.  Translucent tits with the veins.  Yuck.  Ugh, an old lady's stomach.  Oof.  What is the one that says, watch talk sex video, and the title is Dogs, Love, and Lock.  What?  Oh.  Can we get sound on that? 
[03:27:30]  Can we get sound?  Can we, uh, no, we can't, right?  That would be much too convenient.  That would be too easy.  Ugh.  Could someone maybe get a couple more of these clips before you...  Oh.  What do I do?  Put the mic near it.  Oh, my God.  All right, wait, wait.  Where's the speaker?  Where's the sound coming out of?  The internal speaker under the console.  Forget it.  Maybe someone could just get that for the show.  If anyone notices, she has hair like Lee Abrams. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, I was trying to come up with something.  That's perfect.  Damn it, that's the one.  I was saying, she has, like, a man's due.  Yeah.  A lot of women, when they get older, decide to go that route.  We've talked about that.  They just give up any femininity whatsoever and decide it's more convenient.  It's easier for them to wash their hair if they cut it all off and make it like a man's style.  See these women that just cut the sides?  They're so short and everything.  It's a guy haircut.  Grow your hair. 
[03:28:30]  I like it pretty.  Yeah.  Yeah, nice mullet kind of girl.  Although there is the opposite scary thing.  Like when you're driving down the street and you see a big head of hair, maybe in pigtails even,  and you go for the look and realize she's, like, 70 years old.  You ever have that happen?  Yeah.  You look at it and maybe she's slender and stuff with boots on.  And you're driving past and you see, like, pigtails.  And you go, ooh, let me take a, oh, my God! 
[03:29:00]  Or the opposite.  You see, like, a little gray.  And you're like, eh, an older woman.  I wouldn't mind fucking her because her body is nice.  And you see her fed and she's a pejoria kid.  It might have been funny if I said you see her face instead of you see her fed.  Her fed.  I like looking you right in the fed and saying, hey.  Hey, fed.  You know, fed.  Frank, you want to run a fed?  Hey, fed.  I was going to say face and head, so I just put them together.  Yeah, fed.  All right, we got some Nancy Reagan clips.  Yes.  We'll do the old grandma sex lady tomorrow, I guess. 
[03:29:30]  I want to be deep-throated, Mommy.  Don't just lick the head, Nancy.  I don't care what that old bag says.  You've got to play it like a trombone.  Suck on little Ronnie right to the tonsils.  When you get head from Nancy, you know you're getting big head.  Ever see her?  It's huge. 
[03:30:00]  Nancy Reagan on Good Morning America.  Yesterday, describing the moment of Ronnie's death.  If the death can be...  You know, maybe we should use the Hulk music.  And then, Derek, maybe you should get the Benny Hill music.  I want to try something.  Oh, yeah, a little contrast.  This usually shows the importance of music behind anything.  Yeah, TV does this all the time.  Yeah.  To play with your heartstrings, to get your eyeballs tearing. 
[03:30:30]  Let's hear Nancy talking about Ronald Reagan's final moments  with some touching, sad music.  If the death can be peaceful and lovely, that one was.  He hadn't opened his eyes in a long time.  One eye, occasionally.  And it wasn't the bright blue that his eyes always were. 
[03:31:00]  And when it came down to what we knew was the end.  And I was on one side of the bed with Ron, and Patty was on the other side.  And Ronnie, all of a sudden, turned his head and looked at me and opened his eyes and just looked.  And then he closed them. 
[03:31:30]  What a gift he gave me at that point.  What a wonderful gift.  That's a gift?  Wow.  He died in the bed.  Lovely present.  Jesus.  A gift.  Hard to find that in a catalog.  What would you want for Christmas?  The last stare of a 55-year partner?  I'll have to back order that.  Holy shit. 
[03:32:00]  Jesus, I thought that was weird.  Yes.  Occasionally, I'd, well, open one eye and go,  I'm Popeye.  Yes, Nansky.  Where's Bluto?  Let's listen to that same thing, Anthony, with some different music, okay?  Right?  I bet it has a little different feel to it.  If you will, Derek.  If the deck can be peaceful and lovely, that one was. 
[03:32:30]  He hadn't, um, he hadn't opened his eyes in a long time.  One eye, occasionally.  And it wasn't the bright blue that his eyes always were.  And when it came down to what they knew was the end.  And I was on one side of the bed with Ron, and Patty was on the other side. 
[03:33:00]  And Ron, all of a sudden, turned his head, and looked at me, and opened his eyes, and just looked.  And then he closed them.  Well, what a gift he gave me at that point.  What a wonderful gift.  Well, no shit.  By the way, I don't know if you guys read the email from Eric Logan, but it was really a brilliant point. 
[03:33:30]  He said that when Nancy talks about Ron's death, she's not happy.  Well, he is very insightful.  That guy's on point.  Let's see.  Let's go to this clip here really fast.  Nancy talking about how she still talks to Ron Reagan.  Oh.  Some people say that they actually find themselves talking, still talking, to someone they've lost. 
[03:34:00]  Do you?  Sometimes.  Mm-hmm.  He's very much with me.  Everything still is all about him.  I mean, the library is all about him.  Everything is about him.  It's all about me, asshole.  She still taught, leave me alone already.  I'm back to fucking Jane Wyman. 
[03:34:30]  Had it.  Walks around the house babbling my name.  I've moved on.  You too.  What she didn't realize is that last time he opened his eyes, he was like, ah, fuck, still here.  I was gonna get up, but fuck it.  That big misshapen Pez head just looking at you. 
[03:35:00]  Can I help you?  What?  Nothing ready, you morbid bitch.  Go to the store.  Death watch.  Everybody's lurking around the bed  Just lurking  Staring  Speaking all quietly up shore  Hold the mirror under his nose  See if he's gone  Why must you die  I don't know  Why must you die  Rocky  Rocky  Let's go to Cleveland 
[03:35:30]  Ted, what's up?  Hi, it's Nick  Hi, Nick  Nick, Ted, what's up?  You know what sounds great right now  It's distinctly from that clip  The only thing I can think of was  We don't have to freeze his whole body  Freeze his head  I'm trying to find that for you  I can't find it today for some reason  You know  The woman who's the manager  At the punchline in Atlanta  Was Ted Williams' personal assistant 
[03:36:00]  For many years  She might be interesting to talk to  She's really nice  But she knew him for many years  Does she hate the sun?  I don't remember  She'll talk about it though  I mean, she's got photos with him  I mean, she was his guy  His person  Probably be an interesting  Yeah  I don't know why I didn't think of that  Until six months after the show came up  He said, well, you know  We don't have to freeze his whole body  We can freeze his head  All right, one more clip from Nancy Reagan  Looking back over these 11 months 
[03:36:30]  What did you learn about yourself?  Well, I learned a lot from Ronnie  While he was sick  I learned a lot  I learned  Two and two is cautious  I learned  How to accept  Something that was  Given to you  And how to die  What did you learn?  Write things down  His last days like memento 
[03:37:00]  Jotting dumb shit down on his arms  Tattooing stuff on his body  What the hell is this?  I turned my head  Opened both eyes  And looked at her  Because the Dalai Lama  Had said to me  Gunga Lugunga  And on my deathbed  I received total consciousness  Which was nice  Anthony, Gamefly.com  Yes  I like this concept actually

This will be a tease  I think we're going to have  A lot of audio tomorrow  From her  That we'll be able to goof on  Ron  Is there peanut butter  In this clip?  Well let's listen  He's mating  And what they don't realize 
[03:39:00]  Of course  Is that male and female dogs  Are very different  Than male and female  Human beings  And a female dog  Has a muscle  A very tight ring of muscle  Around the opening  Of her vagina  And that prevents  The male dog  From withdrawing  His penis  From her vagina  Until he has ejaculated  Okay  So literally  His penis is trapped in there 
[03:39:30]  Okay  And that is  Their body's way  Of making sure  That the female dog  Gets pregnant  Humans don't have  That tight band of muscle  Our vagina  Is basically  Just an opening  And so therefore  We cannot trap  The penis in there  I mean some guys  Have the idea  That a penis  Has teeth  And can bite a guy too  A vagina  And I'm sure  There's a lot  Of females  Who would like  To be able to do that
