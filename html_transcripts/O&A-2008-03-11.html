<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal. Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guest Jimmy, dissected Spitzer's actions, focusing on the details of his encounters with the Emperor's Club, his alias "George Fox," and his unusual payment methods.  The conversation was rife with crude jokes and sexual innuendo, highlighting the hypocrisy of Spitzer's public persona against his private life.  They also joked about the upcoming governorship of David Paterson,  making light of stock footage depicting him as clumsy. Numerous callers contributed their own crude jokes and theories, frequently interrupting the hosts' banter.  A listener contest for cartoons based on show segments was mentioned, alongside a technical issue affecting their Buffalo broadcast.

The scandal remained a central theme, with the hosts and callers speculating on Spitzer's wife's reaction and the motives of those who exposed him.  The logistical aspects of his actions, particularly his payment methods, were debated extensively.  In-studio guests Otto and George promoted their new DVD, "Three Dummies and a Puppet."  The show also briefly touched upon other news items including the space shuttle launch, Madonna and John Mellencamp's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, and a humorous suggestion of a Vince McMahon-produced wrestling match featuring Spitzer and other disgraced politicians.  Many callers identified themselves as truckers.

The hosts then expressed their disappointment with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions and artifacts, finding many selections undeserving. They mocked a news story about Billy Crystal's one-day Yankee contract, graphically imagining his comedic death on the field.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a negative review of the film *There Will Be Blood*, with numerous callers offering opposing viewpoints. The Pope's newly announced sins were deemed underwhelming and the hosts sarcastically suggested more relevant contemporary sins, using offensive language towards the Pope. The Spitzer scandal was revisited with further offensive commentary.  Calls covered various topics including *There Will Be Blood*, the death of Jeff Healy (mistaken initially for Jeff Buckley), and a news story about cosmetic surgery on a child with Down Syndrome, prompting further offensive commentary. A musical bit mocking New Orleans and promotional segments for the hosts' and guests' projects were also included.  Jimmy remained mentioned throughout.  The segment contained numerous instances of offensive language, including racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and misogynistic comments.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a visit to a lesbian bar, leading to crude jokes about lesbians and gay men. One host mentioned feeling nauseous. The conversation shifted to Lee Abrams' resignation from XM Satellite Radio, with the hosts offering vulgar speculation about his future.  The official announcement was discussed, along with cynical interpretations of the corporate statements.  Numerous calls featured offensive banter.  Jokes and comments about Down syndrome were made.  Anthony's gambling habit was discussed in a heated exchange. A story about a woman who locked herself in a closet during a storm for 20 hours provoked further crude jokes. The hosts graphically detailed a prank involving Otto and a diaper filled with feces.  A discussion of a radio station for cats concluded this segment.  The segment was filled with offensive language and crude humor.

Finally, the show started with a discussion of Cat Galaxy Media, a radio station for cats, its programming, and a humorous, sexually charged conversation about cats in heat, including graphic descriptions of simulated sexual acts.  A listener's cat, Jack Jack, and his misadventures were discussed, along with the death of a Cat Galaxy staffer, the circumstances of which were speculated upon. A news story about a pet deer segued into a violent fantasy about assaulting it.  The conversation was saturated with vulgar terms and explicit references. The show also included discussion of Otto and George's new DVD, Bodog Fantasy Sports, a "line of the day" segment, the possibility of Meatloaf appearing on the show (complicated by issues with his publicist), and a discussion of Opie's old radio character, Spuds Buckley. The show ended with a call attempting to reach someone named Cory.  The segment maintained the show's consistent use of off-color humor, crude language, and frequent digressions. No specific in-studio guests were mentioned during this portion besides the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  The controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jots, Opie and Anthony.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let them starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing for the listeners.  And starving them of entertainment.  They are sick, free!  Bobby, please look.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're done.  We're out.  What is this?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you. 
[00:01:30]  You made it while I whipped this out.  You used your tongue earlier than a $20 oil.  You're the greatest piece of ice on the back.  And I've heard them all over the world.  He was banging cuck, Joe. 
[00:02:00]  Two at a time.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn them into something funny.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Kidded.  So kidded.  He's in the hole.  Hey, everybody. 
[00:02:30]  We're all going to get laid.  You are one pathetic loser.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Call back.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, you're a great big phony.  You know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  You blew it.  You blew it.  Pray for me. 
[00:03:30]  And punt.  Yeah, we could go on for hours and hours and hours.  Good morning.  That's an attention getter.  Good morning.  I'm client number 10.  That's client number 11.  That's client number 12.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good evening.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  I'm Mr. Bunket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bunket.  Out of my mouth it will pop. 
[00:04:00]  I'm Mr. Bunket.  Walk in a room.  I'm Mr. Bunket.  Bunket to drink.  What's your fetish?  I love the garlic butter song.  Wow.  Wow.  From client number 13.  I'm going to get rid of all my male clothes and get only girl clothes.  Oh, that's great.  I'm trying to use that phone.  Yeah.  Whoops. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, that's something.  Unbelievable.  You blundering bag of boots.  Well, for the rest of America, we're waking up this morning to find out that our governor  is a perv.  Oh, goody-two-shoes. 
[00:05:00]  Elliot Spitzer.  Oh, goody-two-shoes.  Mr.  We'll get ethics back into Albany.  He's one of these do-gooders.  One of these tattletales, as it were.  And when he was a prosecutor, he'd go after all these causes with this holier-than-thou  attitude.  And, oopsie! 
[00:05:30]  There he is.  Client number nine.  Client number nine.  I don't even know where to begin.  I have never read more than I have in the last 16 hours.  I thought it was inappropriate at the press conference when he held up the picture of  McGreevy and said, at least I wasn't putting that in my mouth.  Yeah.  That wasn't helpful.  Well, do we start with his statement?  I mean, what do you want to do here?  Well, I guess the facts, if no one knows by now, but, I mean, I'm sure everybody does, 
[00:06:00]  maybe in the rest of the country.  Yeah.  They need a little filling in.  But Elliot Spitzer, governor of New York, state of New York for the past year, I guess.  A little over a year, sure.  A little over a year, caught in a sting operation for the Emperor's Club, which is a very high-priced  call girl operation.  Looked like a great operation they had going there.  It did.  I hear the broads cost about $200 to $300 a night. 
[00:06:30]  Perhaps more than that, Opie.  What is it, $5,000 an hour?  It was, yeah, up to $5,000.  What do you get for $5,000 an hour?  Just a very hot girl?  I've never spent nearly that much money.  You get elegance, quote-unquote, and you probably get like a penthouse model.  Yeah, you're getting top-of-the-line girls that will probably do anything and maybe a little  discretion, but when you're being investigated, it's kind of hard to be discreet. 
[00:07:00]  I think a lot of people, the news is saying he was caught during this sting operation for  this prostitution ring, but I think the truth of the matter is they were looking into him  and stumbled on this prostitution ring.  Right.  They were getting a little suspicious with this guy.  What was it, his money?  There's something about the way his money was moving?  They noticed his money was moving around a little bit, so they looked into it a bit 
[00:07:30]  further, and then they discovered this whole prostitution thing.  You can't be the governor of New York and do this.  You just can't.  Really?  Someone's going to say something.  He's on TV.  They're hookers, and they come in and go, hey, I'm just a dopey hooker, and even I know  you're the governor of New York.  Dude, I've been recognized by the hooker.  Have you really?  Of course. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  And there he is, just business as usual.  Right.  So he was caught.  But I guess the records have him as client number nine.  From outer space.  As him from outer space.  Client nine from outer space.  It's going to be a great new movie.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's about a governor that has sex on the night before Valentine's Day.  Which is even better. 
[00:08:30]  Mr. Romantic.  Oh, this guy.  I like to take off expensive women's clothing.  Yeah.  A governor may have sex with a woman like this.  So he was client number nine.  Yes.  From outer space.  And he liked, what did they say?  Some things that might be unsafe.  Was that what they said? 
[00:09:00]  Or dangerous.  I believe he was.  Some dangerous behavior.  Client nine asked Kristen, the prostitute's quote name,  Kristen.  Yeah.  To do things that you might not think were safe.  Yes.  Now, we do have an expert on prostitution in the studio.  What would that mean, Jimmy?  Well, I think that that, I did also read somewhere on one of the websites, I believe he would  like to go bagless, as we say.  Yeah.  Now, a condom, I don't know if he was asking for condoms to be removed during sex, because  sometimes during, let's just say certain types of sex, some girls will ask you to wear one, 
[00:09:30]  some won't.  So, I don't know if they mean he was trying to go unprotected the whole way, or just through  part of it.  I don't know.  I think for that kind of money, you should be able to not have to use any type of protection,  and, I mean, maybe utilize an open wound.  It doesn't even matter.  Stab her in the side, and use that.  And do what you will with that.  I mean, that should pretty much be, for the price, five grand. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  So, you're just saying that maybe no condom.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what it was.  That would be unsafe behavior.  They said he requested that you don't wear condoms.  He cannot wear condoms.  Oh, we were, like, trying to figure out what that really meant in the office.  We're thinking it was, you know.  Well, at least, maybe having sex while juggling dynamite.  Sounds unsafe.  I don't know.  Let's lose some bobcats in the room.  Hungry bobcats.  Yeah, get our heart rates up. 
[00:10:30]  What the hell?  Yeah, stuff like that.  That would be unsafe, I would think.  Sure.  Prop her up on a rickety beehive.  Again, unsafe.  You bastard.  I almost had a spit take.  Wrong.  Took the wrong opportunity to start drinking coffee there, Jimmy.  Kristen, the prostitute was paid $4,300 in cash for a two-hour session.  And what's really interesting, he was going down to Washington for Valentine's Day, basically. 
[00:11:00]  He was down there on the 13th.  Romantic.  He did it with this chick on the 13th, also part of the 14th, which would be Valentine's Day.  Yes.  It was after midnight.  They were actually making a point to that.  It's like, well, it was after midnight, technically Valentine's Day.  And boy, he wanted this badly because he kept calling, I guess, the company that would send  Kristen to see if they got his payment.  Because he was paying ahead of time to a fake, what, company?  Yeah, they had something set up where you didn't have to use a credit card or pay cash with your 
[00:11:30]  hands to somebody else.  Because you'd transfer money into another account that was like a company that was set up by this  emperor's club.  It looked like a consulting company.  Yeah.  And then you'd have an account set up with a balance.  And you would use their services.  Right.  Their hookers.  And they would take money out of your account.  So he knows he's going down to Washington.  He knows he wants to get a prostitute.  But his money didn't clear yet. 
[00:12:00]  So he's calling the company like, what's going on?  Please.  Please tell me what's going on.  He was like whipped up into a froth at that point.  And this is what's hilarious.  The company said that he had a $400 credit, I believe, $400 or $500 credit.  Not getting much at the emperor's club for $400.  But they were trying to figure out if that's enough money to at least send the girl.  Right.  And then figure out business later.  And the company decided, who gives a crap?  It's the governor.  That's not enough money to just send the girl.  And then at the last minute, the money cleared. 
[00:12:30]  And then it led to the girl showing up at his room.  Yeah.  Where the door was unlocked where she could just push it in and wait for him.  And there he was, probably mewed on the bed.  Actually, I think she arrived before he did.  I'm afraid.  Because I was picturing the same thing.  It's like, hey, hands behind his head.  Hi, how you doing, honey?  I'm picturing, yeah, she comes into the room and he's waiting for her ass up.  Oh, God.  Oh, damn. 
[00:13:00]  It's just a fantastic story.  Because this guy, like I said, holier than thou and just a tattletale.  He made it so difficult for radio people to do the most innocent thing, like maybe go see a concert or something.  Right.  If we want to go see a concert, it's a whole big thing we got to do now.  We can't just grab tickets and go.  It's got to go through channels. 
[00:13:30]  And this is all because Elliot Spitzer thought that there was misappropriations going on in the radio industry with payola.  Yeah, every ticket had to be accounted for.  Yeah, every prize has to be accounted for.  I want to go to a show here in New York City.  I wasn't allowed to get a ticket from the radio station I worked for because every ticket had to be accounted for.  And they already gave away the proper amount of tickets or something like that.  So if they gave me a ticket, then there'd be some kind of suspicion.  And this was all Elliot Spitzer is doing.  Huh?  And you have to sign for it. 
[00:14:00]  Just a pain in the ass.  He's really made radio a pain in the ass as far as this type of thing goes.  He was involved in a couple of pretty high-profile prostitution ring takedowns as prosecutor.  So just a hypocrite.  It's another one.  It's like, you know, I have a mixed feelings on it because as much as I don't like Spitzer,  I don't like to see a guy's life ruined by some dumb stuff like this because I don't think it should be.  But it's like when you're that sanctimonious, man, it's like. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, also, it's the line of work.  I mean, you're absolutely right.  If this guy is just an iron worker or something like that and he's going out, a shock jock, perhaps.  Now, if he's just going out and doing this, that's, you know, whatever.  It should be his business.  This is the governor of New York who built a whole platform on how holier-than-thou he is.  And he's got a wife, three daughters, and they showed pictures of him kissing his wife and his daughters. 
[00:15:00]  And all I'm thinking is, oh, where is that mouth been?  Oh, boy.  Where is that mouth been?  Oh, boy.  For that kind of price, everything's accessible.  I don't think it's, you know, like a girl off the street.  A couple more bullet points.  So this happened at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C.  I think we've stayed there when we do our trips to D.C.  Not as much fun as he had them.  No kidding. 
[00:15:30]  Hi.  You weren't who I was expecting.  This is a legendary hotel, too.  Need some company?  No, Kenny.  You look lovely this evening.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oaf, number one.  I was going to go with dullard, but very good.  Anything, number, anything.  Yeah.  There's plenty of Kenny jokes there.  Dumb horse just standing with a bag of oats. 
[00:16:00]  Let's see.  Why aren't we on in Buffalo?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  We have huge ratings there.  Why?  John, what's going on?  I don't know.  They got some crap music on.  It's just I turned you on, and then when I saw you weren't on, I went on the Internet  and got you on K-Rock.  Oh, wow.  Must be something with the feed.  Let me find out through Steve, but thanks for giving us the heads up.  Maybe they're just having a little technical problem.  Where's Client 15, Steve?  Where is he?  Yeah, we're rocking today, too, because of this Elliot Spitzer thing. 
[00:16:30]  We need Buffalo to hear this.  I like something a little different.  Thanks, John.  I was wondering if maybe you could just shave my face and slap it.  Hello, Empress Club.  Can you send over an emperor?  I'm bisexual number nine.  Oh, I thought this was for penguins.  They have a fetish.  Yes. 
[00:17:00]  This Mayflower Hotel is legendary.  J. Edgar Hoover had lunch there every day for 20 years.  That's some stuff that's going on with him.  No kidding.  Clive Tolson.  But something you probably didn't know, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the famous, we have  nothing to fear but fear itself speech, was at that hotel in room 776.  They grilled Monica Lewinsky in that hotel.  Yeah.  For the Bill Clinton thing.  And a few other things.  It's a fine hotel.  It's just a few blocks from the White House, by the way.  Just a mere few blocks from the White House. 
[00:17:30]  And I bet you Elliot Spitzer got there, because they said he got there after she did, so he  probably had a suit on.  He probably had that.  His underarm probably stunk.  His breath was probably clam, like dry breath, because he was so excited to get there.  Oh, he probably was.  He's the governor.  Nobody ever tells him when he has spittle breath.  You want to chew a mint already?  Thumpster breath?  Yeah.  He just looks like a creep.  Yeah.  He looks like a creepy guy that you could just see just saying filthy things. 
[00:18:00]  When is he going to step down?  Wow.  I don't know.  You can't fight this one.  This one you can't fight.  No, no.  He will be stepping down.  No.  And, well, I guess, we don't know what to do with this one.  There's so much to do.  We're just organizing here.  But when he does step down, probably as early as this morning, we are going to have a blind  black governor here in New York City.  Yes.  Or here in New York State.  Excuse me.  From Harlem. 
[00:18:30]  What's his name?  Blues artist.  What do you call...  No.  A blind Mr. Governor?  Patterson?  Dave Patterson.  Right.  They had some stock footage of Dave Patterson.  And we pretty much fell on the floor because they showed him...  Oh, were we laughing?  Yeah.  When he stepped up to the podium.  It was just stock footage.  You would think they would clean up his stock footage and help a brother out. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, no.  They wanted to show him looking ridiculous.  He steps up to the podium where he's supposed to bang a gavel.  And he's just...  His hands are whipping all over the place.  He doesn't know where he is.  He doesn't know where the podium is.  So his helper, some guy that's next to him, hands him the gavel.  But he didn't show him where the little gavel tapping thing was.  You know, that little round coaster looking thing that you tap the gavel on.  So he just starts banging the gavel and hits the top of a water glass that's next to the... 
[00:19:30]  It's just...  And I'm looking going, this is our governor now.  Yeah.  It's going to be, you know, the second Spitzer resigns.  But wow.  I guess Spitzer thought it looked...  It would probably look good to have him as a lieutenant governor.  Mm-hmm.  He's had, I guess, an illustrious little career in Harlem.  His wife apparently didn't like Elliot Spitzer.  Wasn't voting for him.  Even though he picked her husband... 
[00:20:00]  Oh, she knew something.  ...as lieutenant governor.  Yeah.  She could smell a rat, huh?  And, oh boy.  Oh boy.  Let's say hi to Scott in D.C.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Scott.  Hey, the good news is the governor might be over for a political career, but he's got  a great movie coming out.  I think it's Mr. Spitzer Goes to Washington.  You know what?  That stunk and it was good at the same time.  Yeah.  That's something there.  Watch now, boys.  All right, buddy.  It was clever. 
[00:20:30]  There's a few Spitzer jokes in there somewhere.  Well, she was a New York girl, too.  She wasn't a D.C. girl.  He had to put her on the train and a track.  Not even the Ocella.  I know.  Just get on a train.  What a cheapo.  I wanted half that money, though, was because of where she was going.  Right.  Like, he couldn't do it in New York.  He would not do this in New York.  Why'd you just get a Washington girl, though?  What are you doing, dude?  I don't know.  She took the trip from Penn Station all the way down to D.C.  Dude, I could have talked to him and said, look, you just have a massage girl come over  and you throw a couple hundred extra. 
[00:21:00]  What's the matter with you?  He wanted one of these.  These girls are supposed to be top-notch.  Top-notch.  Just, they were rated on a system of stars.  Three to seven, was it?  Three to seven stars.  She was a five?  She was a five-star girl.  The seven-star girls will cost you, like, $5,500.  And they're just supposed to be amazing.  How do you get your stars up?  I think you walk in and you're allotted your stars and that's where it stays.  Right away? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Like, nature decides that right off the bat?  It has nothing to do with your prowess?  No.  It's just how you look?  I think it's how you look.  Oh, that would suck for the girls that are a three or four.  Oh, man.  And they probably do have ones.  They're like, all right.  We do have, we keep them in the back.  No, they said three to seven.  Yeah, but they probably got ones, twos.  Yeah.  Ones and twos, but they're like, all right.  Missed a limb or something.  Yeah.  Wow.  And the apology he gave with the wife standing there next to him. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, we'll get into that.  Just looking like she'd been crying the whole night.  She had puffy eyes.  We'll get into his statement.  We'll get into the news stories.  We'll get into some of the things he has said over the years.  We'll get into Hillary Clinton's comment, which was a no comment.  Lack thereof.  Because she can't commit to anything.  Nothing whatsoever.  She's a political coward.  She can't stand her.  But his name is George Fox.  That was the name he used.  George Fox. 
[00:22:30]  George Fox.  I'm George Fox.  And I'm going to f*** the f*** out of you.  George Fox.  The name of his actual friend, by the way.  Oh, was it really?  Yeah, what a wonderful guy.  Hey, good thing to do.  What a wonderful guy.  Yeah.  Just ruined George Fox's life.  How you do?  Just call me Greg Hughes.  Hey!  I step in.  Hi.  How great is that going to be someday if not a member of this show named Greg Hughes  is busted with a tranny somewhere?  Oh, you don't understand.  I just didn't know what name it was. 
[00:23:00]  It's the first name that came to my head.  I don't know what happened.  Right.  The apology is on page 92 in the New York Post after being on the cover.  George Fox.  Secret agent.  We are certainly pumped up today, so we will take our first break and continue with this  whole Spitzer thing.  Just unbelievable.  Our phone number.  We don't even have to give it out, but if you want to try to get through a little later.  877-212-ONA. 
[00:23:30]  Elliot Spitzer.  Tough on crime.  Tougher on the coochie.  The Opie and Anthony Show wants you to take some of their bestest bits ever, or maybe  just a bit you think is funny, and animate it.  Draw a cartoon around it.  There's big cash money waiting for you if you do the bestest one, and the really, really  good ones are going to get showcased at a big event we're doing in May to be announced.  For samples of wonderful animations and for bit ideas, go to opieandanthony.com. 
[00:24:00]  Take your time with your masterpiece.  We're looking for clever, not necessarily filthy, because let's be honest, while some  of you are very talented, you're also fucking psychotic, so tone it down if you can.  If you can't, well, at least we ask.  And when you're finished with your animation, mail it in to the Opie and Anthony Show Animation  Contest, XM Satellite Radio, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  Don't spread it all over the internet before we have a chance to judge it.  Thank you.  Dirty, dirty, dirty. 
[00:24:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very busy morning for us.  Extremely busy.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  The governor of New York.  In a bit of trouble.  Elliot Spitzer.  And there's a theory why he hasn't resigned yet.  I think Dan's onto something here.  Dan the trucker, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah, it's me. 
[00:25:00]  Big listener.  Big fan of the show.  Hey, yeah, they think he's using that as leverage in case charges are brought up against him.  Usually there's a resignation when they practically admit that they're guilty.  They resign immediately.  If they think he's using that as leverage, if they come up with charges, he can resign.  You know, he'll resign as long as...  I kind of like that theory.  I think you might be onto something.  Sure.  I'd like to see him...  Yeah, I'd like to see him resign. 
[00:25:30]  Walk up to the podium with a little paper lunch bag.  Pull something out of it and blow his brains out.  Our Bud Dwyer style.  Well...  I don't know.  This guy's life is just...  Oh, look.  Here it is.  Here's the clip we were talking about.  Look at him with the gavel.  Watch.  This is...  Here's the blind guy, Patterson.  Look when he goes to bang the gavel.  Hey, I'll hit a water glass.  The other guy had to take...  Hit his hand and go, stupid.  Hey, dummy. 
[00:26:00]  Well, if Elliot Spitzer resigns today and it's sounding like he's going to do just that  or very, very soon, the governor of New York will be a black blind guy from Harlem.  Yeah.  The first black governor in New York state history.  How about that?  And only the third nationwide, I believe.  How about that?  Kyle from Long Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  First time in a long time.  You guys are killing me this morning.  Thank you, sir.  I just want to know.  I just want to know.  Is there any truth to the rumor that Spitzer picked Patterson because he wasn't going to 
[00:26:30]  see anything?  Hey, I didn't see nothing.  Don't ask me a thing.  I'm blind.  I've been blind since birth.  Hey, can I say this, too, right here?  The guys, the two other guys arrested from my old town where I lived with Florentine.  Besides Lewis, those arrested in the ring were Mark Brenner and Cecil and, in quotes, Katie  Sewell, who lived together in Cliffside Park, New Jersey.  Which is right across the river here.  Brenner is the alleged mastermind, while Sewell, who routinely dressed in fishnets and short 
[00:27:00]  skirts, was the banker.  I love this story.  It gets better and better.  I couldn't be happier.  The story, what, hit a couple weeks that this prostitution ring was busted, right?  Yeah.  And we did a little bit on it, but nothing like this.  Now we've got to get all the details about this place.  High-priced call girls.  We got...  There's a whore living in your building!  Get your own governor! 
[00:27:30]  We have an Elliott Spitzer campaign ad.  You want to hear it?  Sure.  All right.  Recently, my running mate David Patterson and I toured the school he attended as a  child, walking past the very same hall signs he did 40 years ago.  You begin your journey on trustworthy turnpikes, make a left past Honesty Road, turn down Integrity  Lane, and eventually, if you've walked the right way, end up on Responsibility Road.  Starting in January, we'll be leading our state government on the same journey, and we're 
[00:28:00]  going to make it all the way to the end.  All the way to the end.  Trustworthy Lane.  What the hell is he talking about?  Yeah.  Honesty turnpike, and then you make a left up the old dirt road.  Right.  He was a naughty boy, according to reports.  A naughty boy.  A naughty, naughty boy. 
[00:28:30]  He wanted his money's worth.  What he wanted.  Ah, full sensitivity.  That's what he wanted.  Oh, is he in trouble?  He's in a bit of a jam.  He really is between a rock and a hard place.  Yes.  Where do you go from here?  Write a book.  What else can you do?  At that point, you'd probably just write a book.  I don't even think you could be hired to be a shock jock at this point.  Shock jock.  He's, uh, what do you think happens with the family? 
[00:29:00]  Here's some speculation here.  The family, because now, you remember McGreevy.  Yeah.  The governor of Jersey.  Who came out as a gay American.  He came out as a gay American.  Out of nowhere.  Scandal was waiting in the wings.  He figured he'd nip it in the bud.  Excuse me.  Whack whacker.  And, uh, he paraded his wife out there, unbeknownst to her at the time, too, what he was going to say.  You're kidding, right?  She didn't know?  Uh, that's, every report was saying she had no clue.  She says she had no clue that when she was brought out that he was going to come out of the closet, say he was gay. 
[00:29:30]  Uh, and, and, yeah.  What a poker face she had.  Yeah, right?  Oh, my God.  Put her on the World Poker Tour.  She just stood there.  Hmm?  Dumpfounded.  But, you know, it was probably going through her head.  That explains this.  That explains that.  Breath on this night.  Never touched that.  Slept on his stomach this night.  Hated this.  Always wanted me to do that.  He said, yuck, when I put this in his face.  So, you know, they stepped out there. 
[00:30:00]  She, um, she acted well.  Uh, and, uh, they looked like, uh, they were going to stay some type of family.  I don't know.  Uh, but then she left them.  And it's been nothing but a bitter divorce since then.  Ever since.  Spitzer has a wife of 20 years.  Something like that.  Um.  Three daughters.  Three daughters.  Ranging from young teens to, um.  Eighteen.  Eighteen years old. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  Probably not far off from the age of the girl that he was with.  Yeah.  Uh, how do you then go to them and, and say, hey, look, uh, sorry.  Ah, sorry about that.  She's, she, she is so gone.  You think she's just going to leave?  Oh, so gone.  Take the daughters.  Absolutely.  It'll take a few months, but.  Every time he goes to kiss his daughters, like, goodnight, all, all they're thinking is, where  is that Elliot Spitzer mouth been? 
[00:31:00]  It depends on what comes out.  Because a tryst with a hooker is bad.  Mm-hmm.  But there are women that could, once the embarrassment's gone, they could live with it, because it's,  it's just a sex thing.  It's not a personal, it's not like he was carrying on an affair, uh, with his secretary.  I don't know.  I don't think that washes with, uh, a lot of women there, Jim.  I think it is a very personal thing.  Maybe not to, to the guy.  The guy might just think, hey, it's a night of sex.  But to her, it's complete, uh, you're, you're trouncing on the marriage vows. 
[00:31:30]  You're telling her pretty much, you're not attractive.  You don't satisfy me sexually.  And she's got her group of friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Egging her on.  And now she's completely, stay with him.  Completely embarrassed, and they're, uh, you know, it's just.  And you know, she could just get a fortune from the guy.  Yeah.  She's been with him 20 years throughout his career.  She's taking everything if she leaves.  Well, this is, uh, this is the statement yesterday. 
[00:32:00]  This is how it all started.  Out of nowhere.  Wow.  There were rumors all day yesterday that something big was about to happen.  And this is Elliot Spitzer.  I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family, and that violates my or any sense of right and wrong.  I apologize first, and most importantly, to my family.  I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.  I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals. 
[00:32:30]  It is about ideas, the public good, and doing what is best for the state of New York.  But I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself.  I must now dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family.  What was that in the background?  The phone, I, I, the first time I heard it, too, I'm looking for my phone, too.  No, really?  What the hell?  That was his phone?  Yes, and it's not annoying at all the way he says family.  Family?  Family?  It's not an eight-syllable word you ask.  I want to apologize to my family. 
[00:33:00]  My family.  Family?  Ooh, that's got to be a difficult little speech.  And she was next to him.  The lovely Mrs. Spitzer was next to him, just all puffy-eyed.  She looked, and this is my personal opinion, she just looked sedated to me.  Like a zombie.  Yeah, she's kind of just standing there like, what, what the, what, what, what, what, what  she's, what just happened? 
[00:33:30]  You did what for how much?  Yeah, what, you used our money?  You did what?  You said I couldn't have, like, probably at some point he said she couldn't buy something  because it cost too much.  Oops.  How do you sit down?  Cutting my hooker money.  How do you sit down and have that conversation?  She comes in from a nice, nice match of tennis.  Yeah.  I got to talk to you.  Okay, honey, hold on a minute.  No, you better sit down now.  Oh, no, is everything okay?  Well, no. 
[00:34:00]  I'm having a little setback with the old career.  What happened, dear?  You know I'm always behind you.  Yeah.  We could get through anything.  Yeah.  Well.  It's not you being behind me.  It's who I was behind.  Her name was Kristen.  Well, and then the news just went nuts yesterday.  It didn't look like a pleasant ride home for Governor Spitzer and his wife.  They said nothing as they walked into their Fifth Avenue high-rise.  But the U.S. attorney's complaint against a prostitution ring called the Emperor's Club said plenty. 
[00:34:30]  That client nine, whose sources say is Governor Spitzer, engaged the services of a prostitute named Kristen.  The Emperor's Club boasted a variety of beautiful women, and in the affidavit, Kristen was described as American, petite, a very pretty brunette, 5'5", and 105 pounds.  Nice.  It also says client nine always paid in cash.  What about the boobies?  Client nine always paid in cash. 
[00:35:00]  I hope so.  Of course he did.  Learn from Springer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to write her a check from the governor's.  It's the governor's account.  Was that his money, or was that taxpayer money?  Is he independently wealthy?  I think it's his money.  Yeah.  I don't think, because they haven't brought that up yet, and you know they were digging deep into seeing where that money came from.  Yeah, that's his only defense.  Hey, look, I didn't spend your money.  I spent their money.  And he points to his children.  College money.  The federal complaint makes it appear client nine was a repeat customer. 
[00:35:30]  At one point, he asked the booker to remind him what Kristen looked like.  There was even talk of a $400 credit on his account.  And referring to payment, he said, yep, same as in the past.  No question about it.  Wow.  Mm, same as in the past.  Wow.  The affidavit also reveals the Emperor's Club Booker warned Kristen about client nine,  that he would ask you to do things that, like, you might not think were safe.  You know, I mean that.  Very basic things. 
[00:36:00]  Mining coal?  I have a way of dealing with that.  I'd be like, listen, dude, you really want the sex?  You know what I mean.  Before the prostitute met with number nine, she said she was there, wiretapped.  After she met with number nine and had her time with number nine,  she made phone calls back to the dispatcher, wiretapped.  Wait, she had a wire on her?  The prostitute?  I don't know if it was her.  The phone was tapped.  Before the phone was tapped?  Yeah, I heard they got them on the wiretapped.  Oh, I want to hear those.  And it's funny because I'm really into the wire thanks to Jim Norton.  And, you know, they talk about how the politicians are involved with the drug trade and prostitution. 
[00:36:30]  Like, oh, this is wonderful Hollywood stuff.  And then you realize, no, it's pretty much based on what the hell's going on out there.  How many public officials that frequent hookers are just crapping right now, just freaking out?  Like, even though they might not be involved with the Emperor's Club, but just like, oh, my God, this could have been me.  The Emperor's Club thought they had it figured out because you give the money in advance to a company that looks like a consulting company. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it was hooked up very well.  And they got caught.  Well, Spitzer ruined it for everybody.  Spitzer ruined it.  Because they were looking into Spitzer personally, not this prostitution ring.  And it led them to this Emperor's Club.  How many other big names are on that client list, do you think?  Apparently, everybody else hates his guts, too.  He's a really not liked guy.  Yeah.  His friends hate him.  He's a jerk.  Some of the articles I was reading, his friends don't really like the guy either. 
[00:37:30]  You better be squeaky clean if you're so hated.  Because there will be people just looking to nail you.  I'll bet you they were gunning for him.  I'll bet you he was such a prick and so disliked that they're like, we know you're dirty.  We're going to crucify you.  We'll just sit back and wait and go, well, here it is.  We got him.  The affidavit says Client 9 arranged to meet Kristen February 13th, the day before Valentine's Day, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Client 9 told Louis, the Emperor's Club rep, to tell Kristen to go to the hotel and go to room 871. 
[00:38:00]  Client 9 said the door would be open, that there would be a key in the room, but the door would be ajar.  Yeah, that door's open.  Front door, back door.  All doors are open.  All the doors are open for you, Elliot.  George, whatever his name was.  Well, the phone's just ridiculous.  Let's see what everyone's talking about here.  Mark in New York, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Well, Anthony knew, like, the first thing he mentioned, if Spitzer had any other kind of job, like an iron worker.  Like, what's up?  How did you know, Anthony, that we love all hookers?  Oh, iron workers?  I was in construction.  I know, I know.  A tin knocker, right?  Yeah, I know what the hell you guys like.  I know what everybody on the job sites are into.  Are you guys, are the iron workers sad about Spitzer or what?  Oh, yeah, you know, I voted for him, you know, a high-pressure job like that. 
[00:39:00]  We know how it is, you know, living dangerously.  Yeah, these iron workers, you could have an accident and go any day.  So, you know, they like living on the edge.  All right, sir.  There's a great line here, too, about Spitzer.  You just have to hate this guy.  Spitzer was often described as an Ivy League bully whose take-no-prisoner style was gussied up with $50 words,  and the effect of an accent, but underneath lay a spoiled, rich kid. 
[00:39:30]  His family's worth close to a billion dollars who wanted to run with the political toughs.  Just a spoiled, rich snot.  Oh, my God.  Didn't make it too long as governor.  It's a little over a year.  Let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  Mike?  Hey, listen.  Guys, you got a great show going on today.  But I heard after Spitzer resigns, he's going to get divorced, and he's going to have a little money left over for a nice pad out in Mastic.  Yeah, I mean, this is going to get really ugly for him. 
[00:40:00]  But he's worth a billion dollars, so he'll have plenty of money.  That's family.  That's family.  All right, sir.  My family.  My family.  He does have the effect of an accent.  What a phony, rich kid.  To apologize to my family.  To my family.  Yeah, we got something that Spitzer said a while ago, and keep this in mind as we find out that he was caught on a wiretap.  Yeah.  He said this back in the day to his enemies.  Never talk when you can nod.  Never nod when you can wink.  And never write an email, because it's death. 
[00:40:30]  You're giving prosecutors all the evidence we need.  And by we, I mean me giving them all I need.  Let's add something to that there, Spitzer.  Never talk on a cell phone.  Don't talk on a cell phone.  Don't text.  Ever, ever, ever.  Right.  Don't do anything.  Don't leave doors unlocked.  Just walk down a rainy street with an umbrella and whisper to a confidant like mobsters.  I don't think you can even do that.  You can. 
[00:41:00]  It was Sammy the Bull that was holding that umbrella all the time.  You can't.  You can't trust anybody.  Let's go to John in Staten Island.  John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Why don't all these people make these painful speeches?  Why wouldn't you just hop on the next flight to like Bora Bora and just let somebody else  handle that?  Right.  I would just like.  Yeah.  Could someone else do this?  I'm not getting out there.  I would just flee the area.  People would be calling and knocking on my door going, but you have to say something.  I got a million in the bank.  I don't have to say nothing.  I'm not saying anything.  That's a good point.  He should have just taken off and we never see him again and let everyone else just mop 
[00:41:30]  up his mess.  Or just get out there and keep your same brazen attitude.  Yeah.  I had sex with a hooker.  What's it to you?  Let's say hi to Jim in Jamaica.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  You know, I work in Jamaica as a cop.  I mean, this guy could have went to Stuffed in a Rockaway, got 45 hours, got a girl with  maybe a little hair on her chin or an Adam's apple.  He got the same thing.  And we would have kept it discreet.  You know what I mean?  Discreet. 
[00:42:00]  I hear you.  Imagine being this guy's kid going to school, client number nine's daughter.  Well, he thought he was safe.  He had the money to spend.  And this prostitution ring was set up in such a way that everyone felt safe using it.  But they were looking at him.  Somebody wanted him bad.  That's what it comes down to.  And they noticed his bank account.  There was some money being exchanged.  And they looked into it.  And it led him to this Emperor's Club.  He should have a little Jimmy temper now.  He could have gotten some more better. 
[00:42:30]  There you go.  Well, I could have saved him a few dollars.  Let's say hi to Mike in Fort Bragg.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I know what Spitzer's wife can do now.  She can just run for president.  You know?  Yeah.  It seems to be.  That seems to be the only qualification you really need.  Right.  If they stay with the spouse, you know that there's a motive for it.  Either they want a political future or they want something out of it.  Then they'll just stay with them and use them, you know? 
[00:43:00]  Well, I think in this case, she's just shell-shocked.  She probably found out about it yesterday.  I don't know.  Your name is Christy.  You'll answer only to Christy.  Speaking of Hillary Clinton, this is what she had to say yesterday.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  This is Hillary Clinton yesterday.  Wait and see what comes out over the next days. 
[00:43:30]  I don't have any comments on that.  But I obviously am sending, you know, my best wishes and thoughts to the governor and to his family.  This is why she cannot be president of the United States of America.  Yeah.  She can't commit to anything.  Just have an opinion.  You have an opinion.  She has to have an opinion.  What a safe covering her own ass coward.  Of course.  I want my president, like I, not a big fan of Giuliani, but he would just, he would just get out there and go, look, this is what I have to say. 
[00:44:00]  It's going to piss off some people, but I'm going to say it then.  And you knew where he stood on things.  It's inappropriate behavior.  Yeah.  Why not just say that?  It's a very inappropriate behavior for a public official, blah, blah.  Just say something.  Say like this.  Of substance.  If these accusations are true, this is disgusting.  You know, you would, you would get a lot of respect from potential voters.  You say nothing. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  At least say if it's true.  Like, I don't, if she would have said, look, I don't know if it's true and I hope it's not true, but if it's true, he's got to step down.  Yeah.  I hate politicians for that reason right there.  I hate them all.  Well, she's a, she's a coward.  She's the worst.  She's a big coward.  Bigger than most.  She's really, really grossly wishy-washy about everything.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  We got to take another break.  I'm trying to listen to my new Robert Palmer tape and Mrs. Spitzer's just buzzing in my ear. 
[00:45:00]  Su-su-sudio.  Where are you going, Elliot?  I have to return some videotapes.  Another break and then right back to the phones.  People calling from all over the country today.  Look at that.  Why did the governor have to pay for it?  Well, we'll ask Jimmy.  Why does the governor have to pay for it?  Because he's the governor.  You can't just go out popping into bars and trying to pick up chicks. 
[00:45:30]  I think because it's a little risky to call an aide and go, could you get me a girl?  Yeah.  I'm lonely.  It's not the 60s.  My family.  My family.  My family.  He's apologizing to his family.  To my family.  My family.  Who talks like that?  Steve.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We'll go right back to the phones after the break.  Elliot Spitzer.  Hypocrite of the Century.  You don't have to put on the red lights. 
[00:46:00]  I get it.  Those days are over.  You don't have to sell your body to the night.  And puns.  Rock sand.  I'm still burning over that stupid Hillary.  Oh, no kidding.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't commit.  Don't get on TV and be honest when you're pushing yourself to be president.  Someone's writing that she's not committing because Elliot Spitzer is a super delegate. 
[00:46:30]  Super delegate.  Yeah, but she can't even commit to a baseball team.  No.  We don't know what she stands for.  She's the worst.  Oh, there he is, Elliot Spitzer and his wife getting out of their escalade, going into their  house, where apparently we heard today that they got their hands, the news got their hands  on the governor's schedule for the day, and nothing is scheduled. 
[00:47:00]  Of course not.  So him and his wife are in that house.  Oh, my God.  All day with nowhere to go.  He is just being yelled at.  What do you do?  Why?  Why?  It was the day before Valentine's Day.  I know, honey.  I'm weak.  I'm sorry.  I'm weak.  I know.  I know.  I know.  How could you do this to our family? 
[00:47:30]  I'm sorry for the family.  All the daughters are upstairs crying in their room.  Daddy tries to come in.  Honey, can I just get away?  Slams the door.  Just slams the door.  Blasts some music he hates.  I hope he has a comfortable couch in that apartment.  Oh, he is just in hell right now.  He's still.  It doesn't matter if you're an iron worker or the governor.  We always bring up the iron workers today.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  It's all about the iron workers today, but it doesn't matter.  He's just laying wherever he is.  You know they're not sharing the same bed last night.  You just know it.  So he's laying there staring at the ceiling just thinking how badly he screwed up.  You know what's even worse?  When you wake up, you just wake up and forget about it for that second you just woke up and go,  Oh, what a beautiful day.  Oh, God.  I got a good night.  Oh, my God.  They all know I had sex with a hooker.  It just hits him like a freight train. 
[00:48:30]  Wait, how's that again, Ant?  It's like, Oh, I slept pretty good.  Where am I?  I'm not in my usual.  Oh, God.  They caught me with a hooker.  Oh, God.  It's real.  I'm client number nine.  Oh, no.  Oh, I thought it was a bad dream.  I'm weak. 
[00:49:00]  I love it.  That poor bastard.  Dude, he's not.  James Carvel looks like an alien.  He is really creepy looking.  No kidding.  Oh, the worst.  He should get a wig or a top hat.  A top hat.  He's awful.  Look at him.  He is.  He's like one of those typical aliens that people draw after they've had the probe.  He, um, he's 49 years old and he's the governor and he lives in that great apartment.  His life is ruined.  Hey, uh, we got some music for your bit, Anthony, if you want to try one more time. 
[00:49:30]  Oh.  God, I got a good night's sleep.  I must have been tired.  I had a weird dream last night.  Where am I?  I, um, I'm not in my usual bedroom.  Where's, where's the wife?  Oh, my God.  They caught me with a hooker.  Oh, my God.  I'm client number nine.  My life is ruined. 
[00:50:00]  I have to resign as governor.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, that can't be.  I want to go back to sleep.  Oh, my God.  The lieutenant governor's a blind.  I'm going to leave this state with a blind.  A blind.  It's impossible. 
[00:50:30]  What was I thinking?  I at least know he didn't see anything.  Yeah, that's it.  He stood by.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  During his time as Attorney General, Elliot Spitzer was tough on white-collar crime and  securities fraud.  While at the Emperor's Club, he enjoyed having his b**** tickled with the feathers of exotic  waterfowl.  Re-elect client number nine for governor.  Paid for by the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, just her pukey.  I wish him the best for him and his family.  His family.  Family.  Can we hear his family work?  Can we start?  Family.  Oh, my God.  I can't get it out of his accent.  Love the family clip.  You want the family clip?  All right, let's see.  It does reek.  That article was right.  It reeks of just rich kid pomposity.  Pomposity.  I like it, Jimmy.  I love it.  That was well said by me.  Indeed.  Bravo.  I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family. 
[00:51:30]  Family.  My family.  Family.  Family.  The spooks are family.  I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and that violates my or any sense  of right and wrong.  I apologize first and most importantly to my family.  Family.  I apologize to the public whom I promised better.  I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals. 
[00:52:00]  It is about ideas, the public good, and doing what is best for the state of New York.  But I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself.  Pick up the phone.  I must now dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family.  And answer my phone.  Hi, Elliot.  Hi.  I'm going to need another two grand for the train.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm here with my family. 
[00:52:30]  Another two grand.  I love this guy.  Oh, he's a naughty one.  Oh, he's so filthy.  I'll put your flight coach, bitch.  Hello, Elliot.  I'm just calling because you're an hour late for our appointment.  Where are you?  You haven't been answering your phone.  Have you been busy?  To listen to the news, dummy.  Right.  Elliot, where are you?  I'm having a press conference right now.  I'm resigning, stupid. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks to you.  Probably wondering if he could get the money out of his account.  Because he had some extra money in there.  Yeah, wow.  Because they called him the penny pincher.  That was like another little code name that they had for him.  Yeah.  He's bargaining like it's some Budapest marketplace with these frigging $5,000 hookers.  Let's say hi to William and M.O.  William?  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  I just kind of wanted to state the obvious, man.  You guys are killing this morning, though.  But the last name, Spitzer.  Well, that's a little hacky.  Well, I think we all know the Spitzer jokes.  Yes.  Well, that's where you get to play along at home.  It should be Elliot Pazer.  It would have been, that's only funny if his lieutenant governor would have been called 
[00:54:00]  Swallow.  Spitzer Swallow.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, now.  Does Homer have any opinions on that joke?  Oh, I think Homer could be cute on every bank.  A bank without Homer is not a bank at all.  Right.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Kevin.  I stink.  I'll tell you why.  Because I was going to say that if the governor ever has to go to prison for this, he's going  to have to change his name from Spitzer to Swallow. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, what timing.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  Jimmy, I've got to ask you something since you're so good at the, you know, ladies of  the, you know, whatever.  Anyway, if he's client number nine, he's in the top ten.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  I don't know what it means.  I don't know how they name you.  It couldn't be just in order.  No.  The agency opened.  Right. 
[00:55:00]  It's not like phone numbers.  Benson Hurst, nine.  I don't know.  That's funny.  It's a good question, man.  I don't know how they would number the client.  Yeah, why client number nine?  Maybe on level of political importance?  Or maybe how much he spends?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think they just give you a random number.  Maybe they do.  I bet you maybe client number nine is, you know what, though?  He's got a bank, he's got an account there.  I bet you it's this hooker's ninth client.  Like, she probably has a stable of guys she sees, and he's known as client number nine. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I don't know how they name him.  I don't know how high it goes up, but I bet you that's what it is.  I think it was probably just the investigation, the way they were getting people.  Oh, you think they have them?  Maybe, even though I think he was the primary target, but, you know.  His name was George Fox.  I bet you the government referred to him as client number nine.  Yeah, client number nine.  They just number these people.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Brooklyn.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up, boys?  What's going on?  Hey, Kevin.  I think Elliot Spitzer, number nine, was trying to chew down.  Did you say chew down or chew down? 
[00:56:00]  Let's say hi to Vinny in Staten Island.  Vinny?  Yeah, guys, I'm wondering if Spitzer does resign, does that mean that all of us that work in radio  can go back to collecting money for playing records?  Collecting money and coke, my friend.  Let the good times roll.  Yeah, the old days are back.  That's right.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, let's go back to the cocaine and cash for records.  And trips to Aruba. 
[00:56:30]  This is some more info that's coming in.  We're on top of this thing today.  Well, a prostitution scandal would obviously be bad news for any politician, especially  tough for Elliot Spitzer, because he built his entire career on promises of cleaning up  corruption and rooting out unethical behavior.  When he was New York's attorney general, Time magazine named him Crusader of the Year for  his crackdowns on Wall Street and on corporate America.  And the papers dubbed him Elliot Ness after the guy who helped bring down Al Capone.  His public image, a family man, a loving husband to his wife, Silda, and father to three daughters 
[00:57:00]  ages 17, 14, and 12.  Tonight, Spitzer's squeaky clean image is tarnished.  All because of a secret prostitution ring called the Emperor's Club.  Ah, tarnished.  Squeaky clean.  Doesn't sound like it from the dirty boy that he was.  They said that, um, I was reading something where they said that this whole thing started  with a tax, like they were looking into tax payments and his taxes or whatever they were 
[00:57:30]  doing, but it started a year ago into just, well, look, you know, they said a very routine  check, he burned somebody who had connections.  Yep.  Well, he burned, he burned somebody for real who said, I'm going to ruin him.  Who has a lot of power, a lot of juice.  When, when you're the governor, uh, also your, your records are open, they're an open book.  Your finances are an open book.  But he thought he was safe.  Once again, he was.  Where was this money going?  Like they would, even though it was going into some kind of fake company, consulting 
[00:58:00]  company, consulting company to that's set up just to protect people when they're paying  for whores, what they're just going to take, uh, take it at face value and not look into  the company and see what it is.  So here's what you got to do.  You got to get, uh, your own credit card and use your own credit card and it will just  say Elliot Spitzer.  And then if you get busted, you go, what?  Of course it's fake.  What am I going to use my own credit?  Right.  Yeah.  That's just it.  He was too careful and it looks guilty.  He should have just done it.  Yeah.  With his own credit card. 
[00:58:30]  What am I?  This stupid people.  Come on.  Someone stole my credit card for the 80th time this year.  I never reported it.  Of course.  Oh, he's a fresh, fresh, fresh boy.  Uh, let's go to Rich in Jersey.  Rich.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing guys?  Good Rich.  Hey, listen, I think you guys are looking at this all wrong.  He's not at home living in hell with his wife.  I think his wife is praising him that he's not like McGreevy. 
[00:59:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  There's something.  Yes.  There's something there because, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  She was probably standing right next to him yesterday going, oh, thank God.  Thank God.  It was a prostitute and not a gay thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  If we, if we, oh, I had, sorry, bro.  I had enough of him anyway.  All right.  Uh, moving on.  Some of the things that Spitzer did in office here.  Sworn in as governor the first day of 2007, Elliot Spitzer vowed to root out corruption.  We must transform our government so that it is as ethical and wise as all of New York. 
[00:59:30]  Before taking on New York, Spitzer took on Wall Street.  In two terms as attorney general, he launched prosecutions that shook major companies, a move that gained him enemies and acclaim.  People should not be misled just because they aren't big time investors.  I was reading that Wall Street, uh, cheered yesterday when this all went down.  They were cheering.  Was he wrong to go after them though?  Like, I mean, I'm not going to knock everything.  Like, I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  If he was wrong because those guys tend to be kind of greedy.  It's just when you use words like ethical and cleaning up and family and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  By the way, his smile, he looks like such a tool when he smiles.  He has an underbite and his jaw kind of goes up like that.  He is a douche when he smiles.  Don't ever smile.  Just put that thin-lipped kind of terse look on your face.  That's better.  He doesn't look too good in swim trunks either.  He's horrendous.  He got a picture of him in the paper. 
[01:00:30]  He's, uh, bare-chested in swim trunks.  Looks like he's ready for beauty and the geek.  If they say, why'd you get a hooker, all he should say is, look at me.  Right.  You want to stand, right?  As AG, Spitzer also prosecuted two prostitution rings.  Spitzer's silver-spooned past seemed to prepare him for public life.  Born to wealthy Eastside parents, he graduated with Princeton.  Oh, that woman did a terrible job there. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  Princeton.  Yeah, I can't get past that blip.  Let me see what I can do here.  Is that her or is that the tape?  Princeton.  Yeah, we lost the tape on that one.  That sucks.  Fixing what is broken is the theme of this campaign.  But Spitzer's first year as governor was fraught with problems,  an effort by his aides to dig up dirt on the state's top Republican.  And an unpopular plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.  I pledge to toil each and every day so as not to disappoint the hardworking people of this state 
[01:01:30]  who have placed their trust in this future.  Yeah, he was known for digging up dirt on his opponents.  So that's probably where this whole thing went, Jimmy.  Like, okay, well, let's dig into you and see what you're all about.  So, you know, if by chance I was elected governor, I would be brought down within an hour. 
[01:02:00]  They swear you in and you resign?  Same day.  I would say, I do, and I would turn, hi, daddy.  A lot of seconds, but ladies and gentlemen.  I'd like to apologize to my family.  To my family.  My family.  Oh, this is the worst.  Hi, daddy.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies.  Hey.  The lieutenant governor is going to repeal the payola rules, but only for Stevie Wonder 
[01:02:30]  and Ray Charles records.  Oh.  Boo!  Let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Great show.  Thanks, Tom.  I noticed yesterday you were saying his wife looked like she was completely drugged up.  The only time her eyes really opened up is when he used the word violate.  He was probably thinking, if I just let him violate me, we wouldn't be in this jam today.  His wife's name was, you should have just cut it at one. 
[01:03:00]  His wife's name is Silda, which, you know, he couldn't have said that in a sexual sense  and felt good.  Oh, Silda.  That's right.  Jiggle them, Silda.  Jiggle.  Spit on it, Silda.  Silda.  Silda.  Silda, get out of the way.  Silda.  Oh, he had enough of Silda's, you know, she's probably just a real uptight New York awful  lay.  Silda.  Probably wouldn't do certain things. 
[01:03:30]  Not in my hair, Elliot.  Not in my hair.  I was just at the beauty parlor.  Silda.  Oh, how awful.  Well, you know, she's the wife of a governor.  You got three kids together.  Three daughters.  Do you think that there's really this, you know, odds are there wasn't this huge, passionate  lovemaking going on when she's raised three daughters and there's this career thing and 
[01:04:00]  just, I just love guys like this because, you know, he's a goody two-shoes type of guy talking about ethics and all that.  And they say that these type of guys usually are the dirtiest behind the scenes.  Look at Bill O'Reilly, the crap they found out about him.  Yeah.  All the crazy stuff he was doing.  And he's on TV preaching family values all the time.  And Pastor Ted, the leader of the New Life Church.  Exactly.  There's a whole list of guys like this.  These guys are usually uptight Republicans because Democrats aren't as big for the sex 
[01:04:30]  stuff.  They usually don't go after you for sex stuff as much.  Right.  Exactly.  I love watching.  She's pretty, though.  His wife is a good-looking woman.  I mean, considering she's pumped out three kids, you know what it does to a woman's body.  She's probably like, look, this is just not what it used to be.  There's another option.  You're not pink-socking me, Elliot.  You're not pink-socking me.  Come on.  Just one quick, one quick slinky.  Let me give you one pink slinky.  Joe from New Hampshire has a question for Jimmy.  Yes, Joe.  How do you do, Joe? 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You think Spitzer likes prostitutes?  That's a good question.  Jimmy?  I don't know, to be very honest with you.  I mean, under the circumstances, I would probably say that he loves them.  Linger longer.  Certainly does.  Right now, I'm sure he doesn't, though.  Right now, I'm sure he's not fond of them at all.  No.  Little tattletales.  Well, it wasn't even...  Yeah, I guess they did wear a wire, but the government probably came in and said, look,  we know who he is.  You think the hookers wore wires, or they just tapped his phone? 
[01:05:30]  Probably just tapped the phone.  Oh, really?  Because they said a phone tap thing.  I don't know if he's wearing a wire, if she was wearing a wire.  Well, Spitzer wasn't.  Imagine if the reason they caught him is because he wore a wire to go under the cover to bust  them.  He's like, oh, yeah, I'm implicating myself.  He should just always wear a wire, just in case something happens.  Hey, I'm in on this.  What are you doing here?  It's a big sting operation.  Blowing my cover.  This goes back to one of my favorite things we do, like the guy that's caught with a  prostitute, and then she dies, and now he's got to cover up the whole thing. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  But you know there was some of that going on.  Of course, not a killing of a prostitute, but there was a point where he's taking a phone  call from the wife, and he knows all hell is going to break loose any day now, and she's  just having a little chit-chat, a little friendly chat with the gov.  When he got the first phone call, I think, when it was like, Mr. Spitzer, we've been conducting  an investigation.  Your name has come up in a sting operation we're doing, a prostitution ring, and he probably 
[01:06:30]  just goes, oh, my God, it's just done.  I have to start killing people.  I have to have people killed now.  Who do I call to kill hookers and pimps?  What happens when he wakes up in the morning, he thinks for a second, he thinks he's okay?  All right, wait.  Yeah.  Wait, we've got to do the music, Jimmy.  I mean, come on.  Because he's probably on the sofa, right?  Yeah, yeah, he's just on the sofa, sleeping a little uncomfortable, but. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God.  Ah, I wonder if it's cold out or kind of looks nice out the window.  Why am I looking out this window?  I'm not in my room.  I just.  Oh, God.  Good night's sleep, though.  I was a little tired.  I was caught with a hooker.  That's right.  Oh, God.  Okay.  All right.  Keep, keep, keep it under control.  Keep it.  You can deal with this. 
[01:07:30]  I have to kill people.  I just have to kill people.  Kristen's got to die.  All right.  Who can I call?  I have to kill hookers.  Who do I call?  I have to kill hookers and pimps and silvers.  I have to kill my wife and kids.  Oh, my God.  The state of New York.  I have to kill everyone in New York.  The entire state.  All right.  This is really seeming unrealistic now.  I think I'm just in trouble.  And that bat.  I picked this lieutenant governor. 
[01:08:00]  Governor bat.  Oh, he sleeps upside down in rafters.  Oh, God.  Governor Geordi from Star Trek The Next Generation.  Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?  I'm over here.  Oh.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  Facing the wrong way.  His hand's on a phone book.  Take your hand off the toaster.  Stop hitting the glass with the gavel. 
[01:08:30]  You'll break it, dummy.  Is he the first blind governor?  I guess he will be, right?  Oh, I believe so.  Let's go to Kevin.  A lot of questions coming in.  Kevin in North Carolina.  What's up?  He goes to sign something in legislation.  His signature's on the desk away from him.  Bill never gets passed.  You signed a piece of oak, you idiot.  Kevin.  I want to hear if you guys talk and see what Vince McMahon thinks of the Elliot Spitzer situation.  I don't know.  Do we have angry Vince in the studio today?  Will he be delivering the news to Elliot Spitzer, maybe? 
[01:09:00]  Let me see if we got him in the...  Hello, Elliot Spitzer.  It's Vince McMahon from the WWE.  I've been keeping tabs on what you're doing on the news.  And let me just say something before your retirement.  I'm going to tell you something before your retirement.  If you think you're going to step up to a podium and retire with any dignity, you've got another thing coming.  Hey, Vince, don't you want to get a cage match with the two governors, disgrace the ex-governors, McGreevy, and you get the Elliot Spitzer in the ring? 
[01:09:30]  This is a good pay-per-view for you, sir.  That's right.  We're going to get the Mo in there with the whole bag.  Get in there and mix it up.  And then we'll throw in the blind guy, too.  That's right. 
[01:10:00]  In a cage match.  Because that's all you're going to be doing.  That's all you're going to be doing because you're...  You're...  You're...  We got the blind guy to referee the match.  Silly angry fence. 
[01:10:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Unbelievable.  God.  What a life.  We've seen some great crap in our lifetime. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Just amazing stuff.  Scandal.  Just amazing, amazing stuff.  God forbid Hillary should have a real comment, that stupid suit jacket.  She has a body like George Pappard.  Let's go to Greg in Oregon.  Hey, Hannibal.  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Get in here.  Hey, I figure he probably found out about the Emperor's Club by digging into the dirt of all these other politicians. 
[01:11:30]  He said, hey, you know, that's something I can do.  Where are you, sir?  Are you on the roof of a car like Grape Ape?  That was a terrible reception.  No kidding, Gary.  He can only talk on the phone if his face is an inch from a fan.  It comforts him.  What are you, five feet from a shuttle launch?  Space Shuttle Endeavor is going up today.  Space Endeavor.  It went up, didn't it?  I think tonight.  Night launch. 
[01:12:00]  No, it actually went up.  See, the Space Endeavor was launched last night.  It was night launch within Endeavor.  Endeavor.  Space Endeavor.  Well, you know, he's praying for that thing to just fall out of the sky and explode.  Just something to take the heat off him.  Hey, can we say hi to Gary?  Gary, what's up?  Iraq, why don't you get the original call?  That's what a producer would do today.  If you got the Space Shuttle Endeavor going up, you get the original call from that dude  from Brooklyn, and then it makes everyone happy.  Let's say hi to Gary.  What's up, Gary?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I was just looking online, and an article was saying that the way that they actually 
[01:12:30]  caught the governor had to do with just, like, IRS agents looking into movements of money.  Well, that's where, yes, in Long Island it started a year ago.  Yeah, we got that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so, I mean, I just think it's funny because, I mean, this guy went out and screwed so many  people over, and, you know, it just, you know, just a routine little investigation.  They weren't even looking into Spitzer.  Well, I'll bet they were, dude. 
[01:13:00]  Not to interrupt you.  I'm sorry, man.  I bet you they were.  I'll bet you he burned the wrong person in Wall Street or somebody, like.  Yeah, because they said that they noticed, like, some of his money moving around from  account to account, but the guy's a billionaire.  He wasn't spending that much money that would make people's eyebrows go up.  Somebody.  Somebody had it out for him.  Somebody went after him and found out.  They tailed him, or they knew somebody who said, look, this is what he's doing, and they  figured out a way to catch him doing it.  It sounds like he made a lot of enemies, and, you know, that's what your enemies do.  So, they dig up dirt.  And he sounds, a sanctimonious rich kid. 
[01:13:30]  I mean, you just couldn't be happier to see somebody humiliated publicly than a sanctimonious  rich kid.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We've still got lots to do.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, but first this.  Elliot Spitzer.  Do as he says, not as he does.  I get the connection here.  Oh.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:14:00]  There's a lot going on out there, but everybody is talking about Elliot Spitzer, the governor  of New York State.  Big story.  It's on every freaking TV.  And then they go away to another story for maybe 10 seconds, and then they go right back  to Elliot Spitzer.  We're having a lot of fun with this one this morning.  877-212-ON-A.  You got Regis.  He's going to be talking about it a little later this morning.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure Larry King will be all over this story.  Larry.  Elliot Spitzer. 
[01:14:30]  How important is the condom?  Apparently not at all.  You like riding bareback, do you?  How much do you spend?  It's got to be 20, 25 bucks.  What do you tip a girl like that?  Half a saw buck?  Do you slip her a couple of bits under the pillow? 
[01:15:00]  Just completely out of touch of the situation?  Yeah.  How's your wife reacting to this?  Is she happy with it?  No, Larry.  She's very sad.  What about the kids?  You think your kids will become prostitutes?  Can only hope not, Larry.  Yeah, I guess that would suck.  Some grizzled old guy like you ravaging her. 
[01:15:30]  Would you please not say that, Larry?  Yeah.  Did you go see hookers because Silda's f***ing stunk?  What does Silda mean?  Is that Hebrew for f***ed wife?  Wow.  Let's say hi to Henry in Westchester. 
[01:16:00]  Henry, what's up?  Henry?  Henry.  Hey there, Henry.  You know, if Patterson gets in, all the cops are going to have to learn how to shoot at arms and legs only.  He tried to push that a couple years, I think, right after Sean Bell.  Was that one of his platforms there, that they only shoot at arms and legs?  Well, it's looking pretty good.  Is this the Old West?  The next governor of New York State is going to be a black blind guy from Harlem.  That's an easy target, too, a swinging hand.  Yeah.  Crazy.  And that's one of the things he was into, that the cops have to shoot at arms and legs? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I think he was right at Sean Bell.  They wanted to make sure, he wanted to make it, like, mandatory.  They had to shoot at arms and legs first.  Wow.  Well, if this guy becomes governor.  What do you mean if?  I know.  When?  You can't survive this one.  You cannot survive this one.  And then, if Obama becomes president, what am I supposed to do as just a white guy?  Switzerland.  Yeah?  Yeah.  At least got to leave the state, right?  Yeah, I think you do. 
[01:17:00]  No, you have to leave the country.  I just won't feel like I'm being represented.  You know.  Yeah.  I know black people say they don't feel like they've been represented for a while, but,  you know, do something about it then.  Because now I won't feel like I'm being represented, so I'll have to leave or something.  I want Spitscher to stay, because now I feel like I'm being represented.  Hey, yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Finally, guy like me.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's what I want to see.  A guy I can understand. 
[01:17:30]  They found DNA all over his governor's shoes.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Jimsy.  All the experts.  All the...  Oh, my goodness.  Checking in today.  He gave her a pink sock, Sam.  It was dragging like a tail behind her skirt.  And she left the Mayflower.  I don't have on that.  Standing up on the stage with his wife.  What's her stupid name?  Silda.  Silda.  Why can't I remember that? 
[01:18:00]  If you block it out, it's an awful name.  Silda.  I'd like to talk to you people.  You want to learn about the lieutenant governor that might be the governor of New York State?  This is very important.  This is Patterson.  Yes.  A community ready and waiting to see David Patterson step up.  He's meeting with everybody in the community.  He's all over the place from here.  But just who is...  Wow.  What is going on with our CD players?  This is not the day for these to break down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, no.  What's wrong with the CD players?  A community ready and waiting to see David Patterson step up.  He's meeting with everybody in the community.  He's all over the place from here.  But just who is Harlem's mystery man?  He was born legally blind in 1954 and has made a lifetime of firsts.  Right now, the state's first black lieutenant governor and potentially on his way to becoming  the state's first African-American governor.  Patterson was in the state senate for almost 20 years. 
[01:19:00]  He was elected lieutenant governor in November 2006.  He's a very engaging guy.  He's got a great sense of humor.  I think he'll be a popular governor.  Really?  Yeah.  So blind people can hate him, too.  All right.  Here we go.  Step up so you can swear in.  Oh, Jesus.  Get up here.  Someone pick up the governor, please.  Someone get the governor.  Yeah, the TV cameras are rolling.  There you go. 
[01:19:30]  He's the first governor to ever walk into a wall.  There's going to be a whole lot of firsts with this guy.  Here he goes.  He's giving a speech in Washington by the little reflecting pond.  Oh, jeez.  No, by the reflecting pond.  Here he is, breaking ground for a new building.  Oh, jeez, he just took out the construction worker.  I just want to see him throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium. 
[01:20:00]  There it is.  Oh, there's a happy young fan.  Hey, let's say hi to Dennis in Connecticut.  He winds up and throws it into the dugout.  You blind idiot from the way.  Throws it into the outfield.  They go to set him up on the mound, and they have him facing center field,  and they're going, like, to 60,000 people in the audience.  Don't tell them.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Connecticut. 
[01:20:30]  Dennis.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to mention how lucky are clients one through eight this morning.  You know, they're thrilled that number nine is spitzer.  No one's talking about them.  That's true.  No kidding.  One through eight.  You got to think now that this case is wide open  that there's going to be some more high-profile names that are mentioned.  That'll be the second or third leg of this story  because they're going to want to keep this one going for a while.  Let's say hi to Danny at Howard Beach.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, man.  I had a question for Jimmy being the expert on the matter. 
[01:21:00]  What does $5,000 get you?  I've never spent anything even remotely that high.  I think it just gets you a job on the lecture circuit someday.  Yeah, perhaps.  It gets you hotness, right?  You get beautiful girls,  but she's a $1,000-an-hour girl that he had come from New York.  Like, she's not a $5,000 girl,  but he had to transport her from New York to D.C.  So it's a four-hour minimum, I'm sure, on the train.  I mean, there's a lot of expenses that go in. 
[01:21:30]  But if he had just banged her in a hotel in New York,  it probably would have cost him $1,500 for the hour.  Really?  That's it?  I'm thinking so, yeah.  I wonder if Patterson is going to be up in Harlem  playing a little stick ball.  You know, they like doing that like the old days.  Oh, yeah, of course.  And he's pitching.  Hey, I'm over here.  No, I'll be in here.  Oh, how many?  Wait a minute.  No!  Give the governor another ball.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, come on.  Could you hit the guy with the stick?  Okay, maybe you ought to bat, governor.  Oh, there goes the catcher.  Shame!  Oh, yes, shame.  Shame!  Shame on you!  Arnold Diaz.  Probably knocking on his door right now  trying to get a comment from the governor.  Governor? 
[01:22:30]  Ugh, he's right.  You think the news right now would pay attention  if Elliot Spitzer made a statement?  Just opens his door.  Gets his mail.  Hi.  How you doing?  You think he's like, he's trying to escape  and he's just like flipping around the channels  just hoping he can find one channel  that's not talking about it.  Maybe there's something on.  Maybe I could go to Nickelodeon.  Hannah Montana's even talking about it!  Right now he's on the toilet  remembering that hooker  and his legs are stretched out  and his feet are pointed up at the ceiling 
[01:23:00]  and he just wants to finish  before Silda walks in.  Oh, Silda.  He's got his bathrobe on,  dangling in the toilet.  Hey, Silda.  Anthony, um...  Sexy name.  You want to do a little more Spitzer?  I don't know.  Waking up?  Elliot Spitzer?  Do a new day?  Well, it's got to be rough.  Yeah.  Because when you're sleeping,  you forget everything.  Sometimes, like, you dream crazy stuff  and you wake up and go,  oh my God, thank God, that was a dream?  Yeah, you think it was a dream or you...  I know, you know, it's a much smaller scale, 
[01:23:30]  but when we were fired,  there were a lot of days in the beginning  where I was thinking I'd wake up and go,  oh God, I gotta get to...  Oh my God, oh no.  That's right.  I'm fired.  Damn.  And, you know, it kind of sucked.  So, you know, Elliot just kind of lays there.  This sucks.  Oh, waking up.  Why does my back hurt?  Why...  I'm on a pullout in the living room. 
[01:24:00]  Why wouldn't I be in bed with my wife?  Wife!  She knows I had sex with a hooker!  Oh my God, everyone does!  I'm ruined!  I'm completely ruined!  How will I see my family?  Family.  I can't face my family.  You know, he's got...  Not only does he have to...  Fucker!  Not only does he have to resign,  he has to... 
[01:24:30]  So resign.  So resign.  Hey, let's say hi.  The phones, we could do five hours on this.  We will.  What do you mean we can?  Again?  John the Trucker, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Just wanted to let you know,  you might want to call Jimmy's mom  and have her give him a call.  Maybe she can offer up Jimmy's gym equipment.  Now, Elliot...  Yeah.  You know, there are certain things...  I know you're into the ladies of the evening, Elliot. 
[01:25:00]  But perhaps you can...  You know, it's like Dr. Phil said,  resign, you're through.  Oh, he is a finished man.  He's really hoping, though,  that people look at the lieutenant governor  and go, we can't have this.  I swear that's got to be why he picked this guy.  So you go, eh?  How bad is it he went to a hooker?  It could be worse.  Look what it could be.  She wasn't underage.  It's not an animal and she's not dead. 
[01:25:30]  It's all right.  All right.  We can handle this.  He wasn't a guy.  We'll see how racist people really are in this thing.  Wow.  See if they allow this.  It's been a very interesting couple of days.  That whole thing about trying to shoot for limbs.  Well, we've got a cop on the line.  He's not happy about that.  Let's go to Double G.  Let's not.  Double G, Island Park.  What's up?  What's up, fellas, man?  You guys are doing terrific this morning.  Listen, this guy wants this cop to shoot at the limbs.  You've got to teach everybody first up at the range. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, there's no there's no that's not the way you you work.  First of all, it's more dangerous that way because you want to hit a big target.  So your bullets don't go flying past your target.  And it's just dangerous for the cops.  Stop.  What you got to say is, yeah, I aimed at his hand, but I hit his chest.  He was saying the Pledge of Allegiance.  Sorry, Gov.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  As attorney general, he was instrumental in building cases against the unethical practices 
[01:26:30]  of many brokerage firms in the state.  As client number nine, he enjoyed having only the finest fruits and vegetables pounded into  his **** by high-priced escorts.  Re-elect client number nine for governor.  Paid for by the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I love the fact that in every Steve thing that has something being pounded, a jackhammer  going on.  Yes, pounded.  That puts the jackhammer noise.  That's not possible.  No.  I would tell if I was a police officer, I would say, OK, we'll shoot for limbs. 
[01:27:00]  Governor Patterson, here's a gun.  The second you can hit one, we'll do the same.  We'll follow suit.  Let's say hi to Alan in Brooklyn.  Hold an option.  Oh, my God.  He's killing people.  The governor put the gun down.  You hit the limbs, but they were on a tree two blocks away. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, one by the water fountain.  Let's go to Alan in Brooklyn.  Alan.  Yeah, you know, Jimmy was in the sky with an awful chin that that guy has.  I think, quick observation, I think he looks like the Joker from Batman.  Hmm.  Oh, no.  Makeup.  Homer.  Quick observation.  Yeah, quick observation.  Felt like it dragged on for hours.  Oh, wow. 
[01:28:00]  I thought that was bad.  Gary in Jersey, listen to this.  Gary.  Hey, fellas, what's up?  One-time listener.  Thanks, sir.  Hey, Gary.  One quick question.  Yeah.  Do you think this girl, Kristen, do you think she spits it or swallowed?  Your phone crapped out.  What was that, sir?  This girl, Kristen, do you think she spits it or swallowed?  Goddamn, these phones.  If they don't fix these things.  Kristen and Elliot spits a what?  Do you think she spits it or swallowed? 
[01:28:30]  We got it.  All right.  We heard it three times, dummy.  Why would you call it on the crystal clear phone line?  Oh, I heard it as clear as if someone threw horse shit at my face and it splattered against  my forehead.  Crystal clear.  It rang through my head.  Awful.  That's basically the first joke every single person made when they heard about it.  We get it.  Spitzer.  Yes, it sounds like spits.  Yes.  We get it. 
[01:29:00]  Rework his name.  That's the first thing you do when this stuff hits the newswire.  The old newswire.  He just kept saying it.  He wouldn't let it go.  It was such a gem.  He didn't want us to miss it.  He couldn't comprehend how this wasn't followed with uproarious laughter.  He was expecting a boys club raucous response.  High fives all over the studio.  Of course.  Invite him into the show.  Dude, you are good.  Get in here. 
[01:29:30]  Come on.  We need you.  We need you today.  Where are you?  You're close enough to drop in.  Let's say hi to Larry the Trucker.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hey, Larry.  Hey, the governor's a nick.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, if Larry's a trucker, let me just say something.  Yeah.  If Larry's a trucker, he could have done that joke justice by saying,  the governor's a nick, and then pull his air horn.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Now, that would have been funny.  That's a new.  It would have been followed by, as Jim said, uproarious laughter.  Yes, raucous.  Why don't we.  Maybe another trucker could try, like, that same thing.  To see what that might sound like done properly.  This could be a new bit.  This could be a new bit on the show.  We'll work you through the jokes.  They use the horn to cover up the dirty parts of.  Of course.  It's their own bleeps of the phone call.  Yeah, you got a built-in bleep right in front of you.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Good evening.  Hello, Fred.  I'll tell you one thing about that, governor.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  The new one.  Yeah.  He sure plays a mean pinball.  Right.  He's right.  Oh, okay.  He's being fitted for platform shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah, that deaf, dumb, and blind.  Almighty.  Do you, Helen Keller, songs?  Madam Boss.  He burned his face answering the iron.  Did you get it?  He was a swallow.  He was reading the mental cover. 
[01:31:00]  I forgot to take the plunger out of the toilet.  Madam Boss, listening on BCN.  Home of the River Rave.  Coming soon.  What's up, Matt?  We got a lieutenant governor that is blind, has never shot a gun.  And if he ever has, he probably killed somebody himself.  Yeah.  And he's going to tell cops how to shoot a gun?  Yeah.  That sounds like typical liberal hilarity.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:31:30]  Hilarity.  We got a lot of cops checking in.  Hilarity.  They're basically saying, I can't go to all these phone calls right now.  I'm a cop.  It's almost impossible to hit an arm or a leg when you're in that situation.  Of course it is.  We did the...  I think it's the movies.  This guy thinks it's the movies.  Although, he, you know, never saw one.  Yeah.  All right.  We were going to play Jim's mom's...  Jim's mom call, but maybe after the break we could do that.  Who do we have coming in after the break?  Otto and George up next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Elliot Spitzer possibly likes it in the... 
[01:32:00]  Joe is flying by today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Otto and George in studio.  Got to go to the phones for a sec.  All right.  Hold on.  Try it again, Otto.  Good evening.  There he is.  We got a couple things going on.  We got Roman in Jersey.  Not happy with the program this morning.  What's up, Roman?  What's up, Roman?  Roman.  Yellow.  Yo.  Hi.  Hey.  Roman.  Hello.  Oh. 
[01:32:30]  Hi.  Yeah, I have a blind dad and a blind brother, and I don't like the blind jokes.  Well, you know, we try to just have a good time on the...  I love that.  All right.  Oh.  I was really going to try to be nice and then really be sorry.  Yeah, and then realize he's just a douche.  Let's go to Paul the trucker.  Paul, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, that Paul.  How do you do, Paul?  I'm good.  I just wanted to say that Governor Spitzer is a...  And I think he takes it in the... 
[01:33:00]  No longer.  All right.  Ten minutes ago?  Yeah, I know, right?  No, but it's the start of the bit.  I like this bit.  It has potential.  You get the truckers.  They call up with very racist, crazy stuff, and they just bleep out their own racism with  their horns.  But he said Governor Spitzer is a...  I know.  He messed it up.  But at least he got the bit going.  It's Lieutenant Governor Patterson.  Patterson.  Who will be the new governor of the state.  See that guy?  See that guy there, Otto?  The new Lieutenant Governor?  The blind black governor? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, where's he going to...  You know why there are so many trees in Harlem?  Transportation.  Oh, my God.  He just shut down the show.  He's a mad person.  Did we get dumped out?  I think we just got fired.  Yeah, dumped out.  Dumped out?  That's the least of our worries.  Don't you get the feeling that Tom Hagen and Al Neary are somehow behind this whole scandal  there and Al Neary washing up in the sink in the background with a towel over his shoulder? 
[01:34:00]  Mr. Corleone.  Vito Corleone.  With your silk suits and your olive oil skin.  What is this about?  I don't care how many of you greaseball guineas come out of the woodwork.  I'm black and blind.  Well, listen here, my...  Let's say hi to Gene in Queens. 
[01:34:30]  Gene, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  Kind of a serious thing here.  Well, question.  Do you remember a couple of months ago there was a story that between Pataki and Spitzer,  somebody used illegal wiretapping as a means of one getting the other?  I think it was Pataki trying to get Spitzer, and it was actually a big deal.  So, you know, one of them apologized for it.  What a doodle.  I know Spitzer was involved in some dirty tricks there during the campaigning, but... 
[01:35:00]  They said he was a very bad enemy to have.  Elliot Spitzer, they said, was a very dangerous guy.  If he was gunning for you, he would dig up dirt on you.  Yeah.  Someone here is suggesting a song.  The governor's mansion next door to me was sold to...  Hey, Kenny took away my product.  I don't know why he would do that.  Your product.  Well, Otto handed me stuff, and I wanted to promote it, and Kenny took it away.  Oh, Kenny will take it away in a second.  He took mine so he could bring the XM.  But that's not... 
[01:35:30]  I mean, the reason...  I'll take it over there for you.  Well, Otto, what are you promoting?  The DVD was what?  It's got you...  Oh, it's called Three Dummies and a Puppet.  It's me and Valby and this guy, Pretty Paul Parsons, and...  Pretty Paul Parsons.  You never heard of him?  Not too pretty.  He's a creep.  No, no.  He looks a little creepy.  No, he looks like...  Older Elliot Spitzer.  Shooting victim, like a dead, like an exhumed corpse.  He's an old hippie, man.  He's very funny, too.  Yeah.  So we're putting some tour dates together, and we're selling it on laugh.com and OttoandGeorge.com 
[01:36:00]  to book us in the theater or a club date or a freaking commercial's over.  Oh, no, that's cool.  All three of you, though.  So, I mean, to see you and John Valby, that would be great.  I don't know the other guy, but I hear he's funny.  Otto and Valby is a great tour.  Yeah, go to laugh.com for more details.  But what is it called?  Wanted?  Yeah, for crimes against humanity.  Humanity.  Yeah, it looks like an old, like... 
[01:36:30]  Wanted poster.  ...poster.  It's pretty cool.  It says three dummies and a puppet.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mark in Ohio.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just called to say how much truckers really love you guys.  I was driving down the road the other night for Clayton, and I ran into a rest area and  proceeded to blow up the bull.  The trucker next to me started singing your chocolate rain parody. 
[01:37:00]  Very nice.  Thank you, sir.  Nick, love you guys.  Catch you later.  All right, let's go to Gooch in Cleveland.  He's good for one.  Gooch, what's up?  Dear Governor Spitzer, I hope you get prostitutes and stuff up your bums soon, your grandson,  Frank.  Now they're going with the Godfather lines.  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Joe in Texas.  Joe.  Hey, I love the show.  Yeah.  Hey, what's your problem with black people? 
[01:37:30]  We don't have a plan.  We just want a fucking Muppet.  Oh, hey, hey.  Watch your language, sir, and you might get on the air.  Joe, why are you cursing?  I didn't have a drink.  And your phone stinks.  What the hell is he saying?  I don't know.  I don't think about a Muppet.  Or a Puppet.  Yeah.  Maybe he didn't like that line.  I don't know.  Frankly, I'm offended.  Good evening.  Good evening.  She was very badly raped, you see. 
[01:38:00]  The doctor said he was the governor, but I...  What's the big deal?  All politicians had extracurricular stuff since the beginning of politics.  They used to pull Washington and them guys out of whorehouses, put the powdered wig back on.  You got to make a speech.  You know, they'd go on three-day drunks with whores and stuff.  Yeah, Ben Franklin was a big one with the whores.  Yeah, man.  It's nothing new.  Ben Franklin.  Yeah.  Ben Franklin would go over to France a lot.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  And when he was over there, just banging like crazy.  You can't go to France a lot back in the day.  What?  Because it would take...  But he did.  It took long.  He'd be on that ship.  And, you know, he'd get over there.  I think they should be scandalizing this brothel.  I mean, isn't the whole point of going to a hooker is the discretion that you're paying  for them to be anonymous and they don't rat you out?  But they didn't rat anybody out.  No.  They were looking into Spitzer.  Yeah.  And then it led them to this...  So the whole thing just blew up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, they hit pay dirt. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, we got a governor.  Oh, yeah, they did.  I see.  They caught him on the wiretap and everything.  Oh, I see.  Let's look through some of this pay...  Whoa!  We got a big fish.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I want to be...  I wish I could be there when the report was first given from one guy to the other.  We got something.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude.  Wait, wait.  No, no.  No, guess.  You got to guess who this is.  They're just playing games.  Come on, guess.  No.  No.  Good evening.  She was very badly raped, you see? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, let's...  We're going to try this again.  Chuck, what's up?  Do you like to use a condom?  No.  My health doesn't allow me to do this.  Hold on, Chuck.  Hold on.  We got a couple things going on.  Yeah, right.  Oh, I hope there's some more of him.  Love that guy.  Of course there is.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to guys...  If you guys have seen the new lieutenant governor, he's up.  All right.  The pit's developing with the truckers.  I like it.  I think Elliot Spitzer was trying to get one of the hookers a little loose, I think. 
[01:40:00]  Try the wine.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  Good wine.  That sounds like the voice that should come out of Elliot Spitzer when you look at his face, right?  He's got...  Hinked up on the bottom of the lake.  Oh, poor girl.  Yeah.  I could listen to that guy say anything.  Yeah.  Great.  That great echoey room.  Yeah.  I liked when he was being kicked. 
[01:40:30]  All aboard trade DC.  Hookers carrying beverages walk slower.  How much is in my account?  Take the ring off that finger, it hurts.  Have you ever seen that guy in any other film?  I never said...  No.  Where did they find him?  Great.  One in dog. 
[01:41:00]  Never seen him in anything.  Einstein hairdo.  Oh, God.  He was great.  The rage in him.  They put a ball in his mouth and paralyzed him and raped and killed his wife.  He was hot under the collar.  You see?  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  While serving as Attorney General, Spitzer fought the pervasive influence of payola in the entertainment industry.  Going head-to-head against a major radio company that accepted secret payments in exchange for airtime.  As a customer of the Emperor's Club, Spitzer bumped uglies with escorts who accepted secret payments for sexual favors. 
[01:41:30]  Elliot Spitzer.  He's coming for you, white-collar criminals.  And f***ing all over the back, nose, f***ing hair of a petite brunette prostitute in the Mayflower Hotel.  Re-elect client number nine for Governor.  Mike in Florida, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I'll never forget this, man.  In high school, Ben Franklin had over 50 illegitimate children.  Wow.  All the great things he did for our country.  50?  Why don't you wear a bag? 
[01:42:00]  What is he doing?  Back then, there weren't none.  How were you thinking back then?  It was a white stocking that he could also put on his foot.  Yeah.  With a little bow on it, a black bow.  He tried to tie the bottom of it, and he forgot it was attached to a kite, and they discovered  electricity.  Long way to go.  Bad joke.  What I meant by that, though, is, I mean, do something.  Yeah, of course.  They must have had something besides the old...  I don't know.  I think they used some kind of a sheep thing.  Sheep intestine or something. 
[01:42:30]  I have no idea.  Just maybe flip it over.  What are you going to do?  Let's go to Cigars and Scots.  They just had kids.  That's all they did, I guess.  They pink socked.  What is pink sock?  Oh, boy.  I'll explain it to you off the air.  Okay.  I mean, you can whisper it to him, and we'll get his reaction or something.  That's who I am.  After 9 o'clock.  Just think.  Oh, okay.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Your visual aids did nothing.  What was that?  Picture this.  Hold on.  I thought that was a good visual aid.  Really?  Yeah.  There's no way to...  I'll have to tell you.  There's no way to explain it clean.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to...  I might be able to explain it.  All right.  Anthony can do it.  I might be able to explain it with a visual aid here.  Yeah.  We're going to do a visual aid.  Anthony's picking up his jacket now.  I'm trying to explain this to Otto.  Okay.  And Anthony's putting his fist in his jacket.  He's putting his fist in his jacket.  Oh, okay.  And then...  You're trying to find your other glove?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yes. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  And the inside of the sleeve comes out.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I just turned my sleeve inside out when I pulled my hand, my arm, out of my sleeve.  No.  Okay.  And because it kind of...  You know, a lot of friction in that sleeve, it kind of pulled the sleeve inside out and left  it just dangling there.  Now, there's two sleeves, of course.  There's a front sleeve and a back sleeve.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because I had it, you know, facing that way.  Yes, you did.  Kind of sideways.  Sideways.  And I was using the sleeve that was more toward the back than the front. 
[01:44:00]  You got it?  And the front sleeve doesn't have that.  Yeah.  Only the back sleeve.  No, no.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to the cigars and scotch.  What's up?  And also, that was the sock.  Yeah.  California has the governator.  New York has the govern...  That's pretty funny.  Almost.  Not yet.  He did.  Not yet, we don't.  Let's say hi to Jason in Brooklyn.  Jason.  What's up, guys?  Right.  I was wondering, you guys are going to talk about the spatial endeavor that took off last  night.  Yeah, the space shuttle. 
[01:44:30]  I saw the launch of the spatial endeavor.  Well, we...  That was the top story on CNN.  It's like, are you kidding me?  No one cares about a stupid thing going into space.  No.  That's old hat.  Yeah.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, why don't we play...  What was his name?  I forgot his name.  Andrew.  Andrew.  That's right.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  And this thing is animated where?  On onaradio.com?  By CokeLogic.  But this is the original call we got from Andrew from Brooklyn.  When the space shuttle Endeavor took off last time.  We go to break with this.  We got Otto and George in studio today. 
[01:45:00]  Let's go to Brooklyn.  It's Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  So the spatial endeavor...  Um, you know, the spatial endeavor, you know, the part that the, the spatial endeavor was  actually, was actually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The, the what?  Spatial endeavor.  The, uh...  The spatial endeavor.  All right, wait.  It's, uh...  Hold on.  There's something wrong with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Andrew from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Okay, you're on the air.  What's up?  Um, spatial endeavor.  Um, that space, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger and the...  Something about the Challenger.  Huh?  Andy!  I can't hear him.  What, what?  You can't hear him either?  No, wait a second.  What ship, uh, was built for, to replace it?  I said, Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  What?  What endeavor? 
[01:46:00]  What?  Are we talking about, uh, what are we talking about?  No, it's fun fact.  Oh, fun fact.  Okay, so what's your fun...  Fun fact Thursday.  All right.  What's your fun fact?  It's what, spatial endeavor was built to replace Challenger and the parts that was, the parts  that were used...  The, the what endeavor?  I didn't hear that.  The space shuttle.  Yeah, okay, but which one, bro? 
[01:46:30]  You talking about...  Yeah, which one?  The first one, and then there's another one.  What, I keep...  Because my, my, my...  Hold on, I'm getting a thumbs up from Tim.  We, we, uh, tweaked it.  All right, we got...  All right, the phones are working.  Go ahead.  All right, you're gonna have to start over.  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andrew.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the space shuttle endeavor...  The show that replaced Challenger endeavor...  ...was actually built with spare parts from the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis that were  left over when they were finished built.  From, from what? 
[01:47:00]  And they finished building both.  The Atlantis?  No, I said, space shuttle endeavor.  It's the spare parts.  I mean, the parts that were used to build it.  Excuse me.  I said it again.  Yeah, it came from...  It came from Space Shuttles, Atlantis, and Discovery.  Because they finished building... 
[01:47:30]  They finished producing the space...  Excuse me.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I have a bad phone.  No, continue.  No, your phone's fine, dude.  It's a good phone.  That thing was messing up, though.  So, wait, wait.  I don't understand, though.  You're saying the spare parts were used from Challenger?  No, excuse me.  I'm saying space shuttle endeavor.  The material that was used to build space shuttle endeavor...  What about the other space...  What's the Challenger?  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  So, that was built to replace it.  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  And the spare parts...  I mean, all the parts that were used to make Endeavor came from Discovery Atlantis...  Came from Discovery Atlantis because they were finished...  They already finished building them.  And they stopped producing space shuttles after Atlantis.  Right.  Atlantis was built in 1985.  So, then...  All right.  So, they took those spare parts and made what?  Yeah, sum it up.  So, the what replaced the what with the what? 
[01:48:30]  Endeavor replaced Challenger.  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Spatial Endeavor.  Right.  And...  The material that they used...  Yeah.  To build spatial endeavors...  From Discovery at Atlantis...  Oh, God. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  So, the space shuttle...  In...  What did he say?  Endeavor?  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  What is it?  Special Endeavor.  What is it again?  Say it.  You got to be clear, dude.  And say it loud.  Yeah.  Space shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that, uh...  Well, it is fun factors.  You mush mouth.  We all, uh...  We all learned something from Andrew and Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  Yeah.  Hello. 
[01:49:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Having a little fun with, uh...  Elliot Spitzer today, that's for sure.  In the air?  Hey!  Yeah.  I don't know when George...  Yeah.  ...are on with us.  Ah!  Just another ten minutes of sleep.  That's all I needed.  Ugh.  George was sleepy.  Oh, God.  It's hard to plunk myself down into sleep when I have to do this show. 
[01:50:00]  I can't just go, like, right to sleep.  Nah.  Never works.  You guys are used to it.  Your body's just shut down at a certain time.  No.  Not at all.  Never.  It sucks.  Everyone says you'll never get used to doing morning radio, and it's true, because I'm  not a go-to-sleep-at-seven-o'clock-at-night guy.  I did everything right.  I didn't have any coffee after two o'clock in the afternoon.  I didn't eat late.  Yeah, you got to be a gremlin.  Yeah.  I still couldn't sleep.  You got to be really strict, and that doesn't even work.  I went to bed at nine last night because I was tired. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I think I finally fell asleep around 11.  Yeah.  You just can't shut down your brain that early in the night.  Yeah.  Otto and George in studio.  He's got a DVD he's pushing, and it looks really, really good.  It's called Wanted for Crimes Against Humanity.  High hilarity, Norton.  Three dummies and a puppet.  You got John Valby, you got Otto and George, and you got Pretty Paul Parsons.  Yeah.  The funny part about that is Pretty Paul's not pretty at all.  Yeah.  He's creepy.  Look him.  Looks like Bernard McGurk from I Missed's Show.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit. 
[01:51:00]  And you can get this at laugh.com or ottoandgeorge.com.  Yeah.  I got a lot of stuff for sale on laugh.com.  The checks are rolling in.  Yeah?  I have enough money right now to last the rest of my life unless I want to buy something.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's good.  I've got it.  That works.  Very nice.  Yeah, you saved yourself on that one.  And this is going to be a hard bit to tell.  I was watching the VH1 behind, you know, the true story.  It was, what do you call it, Freddie Mercury?  Remember that guy?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:51:30]  Of course, Queen.  Yeah, and they always interview like the chauffeur bodyguard.  It's like on the weekends after a concert, he would have like a picnic.  He had like four or five close friends over for a picnic.  And he was very wholesome.  All of a sudden, he'd leave with a picnic basket.  Yeah, let's talk to the people who were at the picnic what happened, you know.  Well, he spread out the blanket.  Then he clubbed me into unconsciousness with a ukulele.  And then he violated me right next to the potato salad.  I didn't even get a sandwich.  He left me there.  The limo pulled off with a guy with buck teeth laughing in the back window. 
[01:52:00]  And then I got raped by Bugs Bunny.  What does that mean?  What does that have to do with Spitzer?  I don't know.  But it's funny.  Yeah, it's all about Elliot Spitzer today.  A quick look at other things going on.  Not that anyone cares, but Madonna and John Mellencamp,  they entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last night.  We think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a complete joke, right, Jimmy?  No, I think it's a good move that Sabbath was tried nine times. 
[01:52:30]  They inducted them, and they finally got in before they were inducted.  And her, I think, on the first ballot.  They're relevant to what rock and roll is.  They're really relevant.  We read the list of bands that aren't in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It's just amazing.  I don't have it in front of me right now, but bands like Rush, bands like Yes, I believe.  Kenny and I went there when I was in Cleveland.  And they induct Miles Davis.  I mean, they're great artists, but not even rock and roll at all. 
[01:53:00]  It's just jazz, you know?  We went there because I wanted to trash this place.  But I'll tell you, the guy who ran it told me that they don't, he said, we have nothing  to do with the inductions.  There's a voting board, some by artists.  So they're just a building.  Basically.  So it's not, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame itself is actually, I was impressed at what  a cool setup they have.  Like, the building itself was nice.  The voting board should die in a fire.  The building itself, though, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I have to amend my hatred.  It's not for them. 
[01:53:30]  It's for whatever board decides who gets in.  The actual building is awesome looking, but the stuff they got in is a bunch of crap,  though.  Buddy Holly's return ticket.  Yeah.  Got a half of Mama Cass' sandwich and Elvis Presley's toilet seat.  I wish it was that good.  Oh, no, no.  Okay.  It's stuff that, obviously, the family members found in an attic somewhere, right?  Ah, well, here's Jimi Hendrix, I don't know, Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  There, you can have it.  Yeah.  We weren't going to do anything with it.  Don't have anything of, I don't know, stuff where you actually would go, wow. 
[01:54:00]  Really?  So you got Madonna and John Mellicamp entering the Hall of Fame.  Wow.  And then you got this dopey story, Billy Crystal.  Oh, love this one.  What a waxy puppet he's turned into.  Billy Crystal.  Maybe we should just do the news story on this one.  Hold on a minute.  Some big news at Yankee Camp this morning.  Yankee Camp.  Yankee Camp.  Yankee Camp. 
[01:54:30]  Who talks like that?  It's not normal.  It's Yankee Camp.  Yankee.  Get to gear up.  Yeah.  Listen to the excitement.  Some big news at Yankee Camp this morning.  The Bronx Bombers are about to sign comedian Billy Crystal, and that's not a joke.  Billy Crystal turns six.  No, it is a joke.  Yeah.  It's a big joke on us.  What else could it be?  Yeah.  What did he discover at 50 some odd years old that he could hit 400 foot?  What is he going to do?  Billy Crystal, and that's not a joke. 
[01:55:00]  It is a joke.  Billy Crystal turns 60 years old on Friday, and to celebrate, he is signing a one-day contract  with his favorite team, the Yanks.  Crystal is going to play in the Yankees exhibition game against the Pirates on Thursday.  He's going to wear it at number 60.  Crystal said, quote, I can help the younger players, which, of course, is all of them.  He is the biggest Yankees fan.  And the biggest Yankees fan.  He's so confident.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Why can't they just be real? 
[01:55:30]  Well, this is obviously...  ...to his old black blues man character for the 35th year in a row.  This is obviously a publicity stunt.  Why can't they tell it like it is in the news?  Ugh, he's right.  Who wants to see Billy Crystal out there?  No one.  It's a mockery.  A mockery.  I hate that.  Oh, maybe it's over here.  Did anybody see that movie, There Will Be Blood?  Not yet.  Horrible. 
[01:56:00]  Horrible.  Unwatchable.  A lot of people say it's a great movie.  No, they're idiots.  Nothing happened in this movie for three hours.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It should have been called, There Will Be Milk Duds.  I was at the refreshment stand the whole time.  I really, really sucked.  Yeah, but if you were at the refreshment stand, maybe that's when...  No, nothing happened.  It sucked.  There's no market.  It was set in the old days.  It wasn't a Western.  It wasn't anything.  There's no audience for this movie.  It's a fine actor, but give me a break.  A little thing about Otto that people probably don't know. 
[01:56:30]  You really know your movies.  Yeah.  What was your favorite movie that you've seen recently?  Recently?  No Country for Old Men.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  That was number one.  Yeah, terrific.  The Coen Brothers are just great, man.  That one was good.  Yeah.  That was good.  I liked it because it was no comic relief.  It was just brutally...  Just brutal violence.  Everyone dies.  There was no comic relief.  They didn't try and mix it up.  You make a really good point there.  Yeah.  Hollywood always feels like, ah, we've got to get a couple laughs. 
[01:57:00]  Very grim.  Very grim.  The blood here.  And bloody and violent.  It was really good.  Yeah, absolutely.  Excellent.  Excellent.  I thought you were looking for something over there, Ant.  I was...  Yeah.  With the Billy...  I'm on IMDb and my thing looking for a Billy Crystal sound, but I couldn't find it.  Oh, okay.  It's that one.  Dan's usually pretty good at it, but we're absent today.  Dan is absent.  I was looking for the, can you dig it?  I knew she could.  Oh, yeah.  That old blood.  That old...  When he goes...  I'll just talk about it then.  They were smoking their own cigarettes that they rolled. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we get it.  It's pot.  Schmuck.  You know, and he played a trumpet.  Yeah.  And it sounded like this.  Shut up.  Stop.  Is he playing an air trumpet?  Yeah.  He's just doing a mockery.  Put on blackface and sing Mammy.  I know.  I know.  It is.  Oh, is he the worst?  It went off forever.  Those theater audiences are so forgiving, too, you know?  I know.  John Leguizamo with his stupid characters, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  My Puerto Rican grandmother, my Puerto Rican uncle.  You know, he's so talented.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I know.  Let's go to Josh in Virginia.  Is that it?  Josh?  Yeah, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was calling to say, yeah, Otto, you're an idiot.  There will be blood with an amazing movie.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I loved it.  Which part?  The first 30 minutes, there's no talking, but it's amazing.  You're waiting on the edge of your seat.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  30 minutes of no talking?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was amazing.  It's a guy just doing his one single thing in a mine, but you're captivated by the whole 
[01:58:30]  thing, wondering what's going to happen next.  Yeah.  The first hour, nothing is said.  The second hour, oh, my kid is adopted.  The third hour, has anybody got a bowling pin?  Any freaking clubs a guy to death with a bowling pin?  Three hours for this, waiting.  You gotta give it, you gotta give it to the loser.  I stayed till the end, sucked.  Oh, oh, man, you're wrong.  You're totally wrong.  The guy who was the preacher only had like two weeks to learn it.  Overacting Brit faggot. 
[01:59:00]  I'm tired of him.  Otto, you guys have a good day, man.  Otto gives it a thumbs down.  I believe so, yeah.  Didn't he win the Oscar for that, though?  Yes, he did.  So what?  All right.  Just ask him.  Take my word for it.  It stinks on ice.  I got a great joke.  Yeah?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Tell us how you really feel.  That guy's an ass.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer. 
[01:59:30]  As Attorney General, he exposed record companies that paid millions of dollars each year to  get music stations to add songs to their playlists.  As client number nine, he exposed himself to high-priced escorts, who would point and laugh  at his cashew-shaped genitals.  Re-elect client number nine for Governor, paid for by the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I don't like the fact that our laughs or aunt's laugh is put in there like, we're the hookers.  I know, right?  Yeah, what the hell?  Did you find that on the replay machine? 
[02:00:00]  No.  Oh, you didn't find that?  Oh, you mean this?  Of course I did.  I'm teasing.  What?  Can you dig that?  I do the chooker.  I do the chooker.  Right.  And then, you know, when Katrina came through, it was hard on all of us people.  Where were you?  Yeah.  He was in Beverly Hills somewhere.  Yeah.  But he's the voice of the black man.  Yeah, I hate when he mixes drama and pathos and comedy.  Stop it.  Yeah.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen a quote-unquote comic try to do. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I know.  What is he going to do for the Yankees?  Are they going to let him play, or is he going to just sit on the bench?  Oh, I hope he takes a liner right to the head.  Oh, that'd be fantastic.  Just splits his head open.  He's laying there just bleeding to death on the field.  Fame is a weird thing.  Oh, tragic.  Tragedy today as Billy Crystal was killed at Yankee Stadium.  You know, it was supposed to be a fun-filled day for Crystal. 
[02:01:00]  It was a big Yankee fan.  And to have it end in his death like this is tragic.  Oh, I would just be laughing.  Here's the video.  Please remember, get the children out of the room.  This is very graphic.  As Billy Crystal's big, stupid head explodes with his wispy afro on top.  All you see is a red mist like it was taken out by a sniper. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, I would love that.  Just see his head explode.  Why is his head getting bigger?  Yeah.  Something with being famous, man.  The more famous you get, your head just expands.  Movie stars all have big heads, though.  Yeah?  It's true.  Yeah, they got to have big heads.  It's something about the camera.  Big heads, no torso.  It's true.  Why is it?  Paul Newman, Charles Bronson, Pacino.  Charles Bronson.  Almost every big movie star was freak.  Eddie Murphy, freakishly big head.  But the camera shrinks it somehow. 
[02:02:00]  The camera shrinks their head.  Yeah.  It's very odd.  Damn.  Tremendous skull on Tommy Lee Jones.  Have you seen that thing?  It's like a jukebox.  It's huge.  You dig that?  I do the jukebox.  I do the jukebox.  We got a girl calling in from Stanford, Connecticut.  Girl, how are you? 
[02:02:30]  How are you?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  Good evening.  I was going to say...  It will be what is amazing.  Okay.  And they don't talk for like 12 minutes in the beginning.  It's not a half hour.  It's long.  I'm not 12 minutes.  It might as well be a half hour in a movie.  God forbid a comedian exaggerates for a laugh.  We got two right here that didn't like it.  What's your point?  It sucked. 
[02:03:00]  I don't...  You're silly.  It's amazing, and it's intense, and it's awesome.  No, it wasn't either.  No.  It wasn't any of those adjectives.  School that bitch.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I just want to let you know that Billy Crystal is going to be a celebrity manager, not a player.  I didn't hear that on the news.  All they were talking about was how he's joining the Yankees for a day.  You think Susan Wallman's going to have something to say about that? 
[02:03:30]  Goodness gracious!  Yeah.  Billy Crystal's up in George Steinbrenner's box with his wispy afro.  Wispy.  He's doing the black gentleman impression of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Goodness gracious!  I don't know when this man was funny.  Sorry, Jimmy. 
[02:04:00]  I know you're, you know, you're represented by similar people.  Well, I like Billy.  Of course you do.  I understand what the official line has to be.  No, Billy's been very nice to me.  Has he?  What a ferocious sequel that was.  Oh, not as bad as the stupid sequel, Curly's Gold.  Oh, God.  To that stupid western.  Yeah.  Oh, nothing better than a good man movie where the city guys go and try to, you know, be  rough and tumble.  Yeah.  And the hardships they encounter, and then they all get together at the end and pull off. 
[02:04:30]  They're on a mancation.  That's right.  They all eat the cracker once a night.  Would you ever go on a man?  They all take turns eating the cracker in the middle.  Would you go on a mancation, Otto?  What do you mean?  Just a bunch of guys in the woods?  It's the latest thing.  You know, you get your boys together and you go on vacation.  Absolutely.  I prefer the company of men.  Women, you just tolerate when they're speaking.  You try and look interested.  They have nothing to say.  I wasn't expecting this angle.  They just buzzkill skanks. 
[02:05:00]  I prefer the company of men.  You laugh.  You can say whatever you want.  Be yourself.  Absolutely.  Gleason was like that, too.  Like, they wanted to have fun with the boys, and when you wanted to bang them, you banged  them.  But aside from that...  The boys?  Oh, absolutely.  No, they go.  The checks.  The girls, Naughton.  Aha!  I'd rather go out with Harvey.  That's no good when you want to have some fun.  Who invited the skirts?  Yeah.  I had sleepings for snips. 
[02:05:30]  I even had lunch in weeks.  Just squirts.  My favorite line in that is the prosecutor asked him a question, and he goes, I wouldn't  give you the skin off a grape.  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe and Flushing.  Joe?  You're dumb, Tommy, but you're not that dumb.  Oh, Victor Mature.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, better now.  Just wanted to agree.  I think there will be blood really sucked.  Thanks, man.  Oh, now it's three to two.  Isn't it boring?  Mm-hmm.  I saw a really good bootleg of it.  I want my money back.  It really sucked. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, you know, with that title, you figured there's going to be an amazing, at least two  great gun battles or a throat slash.  Nothing like that happens in it.  It was very misleading.  You got to think a lot of blood with a title like that.  I was hoping, you know.  Yeah.  I'm a New Yorker.  Actually, it's just a movie about a girl who's getting crankier by the day.  Oh, God.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  Oh.  As a crusading attorney general, Spitzer vigorously broke up the illicit activities of major prostitutes. 
[02:06:30]  As client number nine, the governor of New York spent thousands of dollars with the  Emperor's Club, a major prostitution ring that delivered petite young women to his hotel  room to f*** him in the a** with sticks of dynamite.  We hope, because if it was just straight sex, why bother?  Re-elect client number nine for governor.  Nice.  He's coming in all morning.  There will be chocolate and salty snacks and bloating.  Let's see. 
[02:07:00]  SP Matt man.  He's hoping that on his one day with the Yankees, Billy Crystal gets Lou Gehrig's disease.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I'm the luckiest man in the world.  Can you dig that?  I do that you good.  I do that you good.  Yeah.  Was there more of that, or was that all there was?  Yeah, that's pretty much all there was of that.  Everything else was just sleep inducing.  Yeah.  Oh, he just kept going.  How long did that go? 
[02:07:30]  Oh, forever.  It went forever.  Just him babbling about, and the houses were underwater.  And then I had a trumpet that I got lost in the hurricane.  And people sitting there going, well, this is supposed to be profound, so if I get up,  I'm going to look like the jackass.  Oh, he puts people in this position where they have to sit there.  It's like watching a lecture.  Shut up, Billy. 
[02:08:00]  Exactly.  Be funny for overly artistic, pompous.  We got a lot of Catholics in-house today.  You get the new no-nos from the Catholic Church?  Oh, no.  What?  Coming down from the Pope?  No.  The Pope occasionally comes out with new sins.  With new sins.  And they don't hold a candle to the old ones.  I got to be honest with you.  New sins suck.  They kind of ran out of ideas.  Yeah.  I'm not going to acknowledge the new sins unless God himself delivers them.  Yeah.  Not some guy we elected.  Well, it's the Pope. 
[02:08:30]  Well, we didn't even like him.  We elected the Pope?  I said, well, we didn't even like him.  He's a bit queenish, too.  I hate to break it to you.  Yeah?  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, I do.  He was a Hitler youth.  Good for him.  Wow.  He's not now.  I hate to think a...  He's an older gentleman, and I think he's a...  You think a little queen?  Yes, I certainly do.  Yeah, I think he's a J. Edgar Hoover.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You want to hear the new no-nos?  Yes.  This will get you to hell.  Yes.  Yeah.  Thou shalt not put automatic signatures in emails.  This is too modern for the church. 
[02:09:00]  Well, you got bioethical violations.  That would be, of course, birth control.  Oh.  New forms of birth control, basically.  Of course, the continued no-no for the church.  What a shock.  The church wants to get out of touch.  What a shock.  The prevention of tissue has always been the big thing with them, right?  Every seed must be, yeah.  Yeah, utilized.  Every sperm is sacred.  You can't waste it.  Well, that leads to the next no-no. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  The new no-no.  Morally dubious experiment, such as stem cell research.  It's a no-no.  Yeah.  Why would you bother with stem cell research when it helps people?  It's science.  It's not some mythical creatures that are floating around in some abstract space that's called heaven.  How about adding extra relish to tartar sauce?  Does he have anything to say about that?  It's not junky enough.  It's a sin.  Oh.  Number three is drug abuse.  Uh-huh.  A new no-no from Pope Benedict. 
[02:10:00]  Number four, polluting the environment is now a sin.  Wow.  You were right.  These don't hold up to the old ones.  They don't hold up.  Pollution.  So if you throw, like, a carton or something out of your window when you're driving, it's  just as bad as coveting someone's wife.  Those were some good sins back then.  Yeah.  You don't covet.  Holding the fart and pull out.  Thou shalt not kill or make the Indian cry on the side of the road. 
[02:10:30]  There you go.  The next one, contributing to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.  Oh.  How do you do that?  Contributing to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.  Yeah, they're running out of stuff.  They're really running out of sins.  These sins stink.  Well, he's saying share the wealth and, like, well, how about him take one of their million  dollar hats that the Pope wears and give it some crack or, you know, let her get a buzz.  God, Otto, you hit it right on the head.  Yeah.  The Vatican is one of the most wealthy organizations. 
[02:11:00]  The Catholic Church is one of the most wealthy organizations.  Yeah.  Talk about a disparity.  Pour in the Pope hat.  Pour in the Pope hat.  That's the staff that he has.  Sell the Popemobile.  Buy a new shopping cart.  Buy a Volkswagen.  Well, at least.  You're Nazi.  Filthy, lying sodomite.  You're Nazi queen.  Yeah.  Do you have any audio of the Pope talking in his voice?  Let's find it.  Look, here's the next one is excessive.  The next no-no is excessive wealth. 
[02:11:30]  That's the Catholic Church.  And basically where he lives.  The Vatican is excessive wealth.  How about the next no-no is not living off government land and not paying taxes?  How about not protecting...  Nazi commie homo.  How about not moving priests who you know are guilty of a pedophilia from parish to parish?  Is that what they do?  Oh, they just rotate them around.  Oh, they bury them.  Oh, okay.  They don't take them out of circulation.  They lamb it.  They lamb it for a while.  Yes, they do.  Wow.  Lamb it.  I'm on the lamb. 
[02:12:00]  I watch The Sopranos.  They're a bad regional manager.  They don't want to fire them, so they just move them from store to store, hoping they'll  kind of connect.  They do more trading than Major League Baseball.  They just move these guys around.  Send them to another city full of children.  And another no-no is creating poverty, which...  You can't create poverty.  How do you do that?  I guess firing.  I don't know.  Firing people, taking their jobs away.  Awful bunch of sins.  Right?  Horrid.  Yeah.  I don't like this New Year's batch of sins. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Marco in Queens.  Marco.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  I want to let you know that you guys pretty much broke every single one of those sins on  air.  I don't know what to do in the privacy of your own home, but definitely on air.  Yeah.  Oh, do we have that?  Thank you, sir.  We just got a communique here.  We have it.  Here's Iraq.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Now. 
[02:13:00]  Now?  I do want to hear that.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Niagara Falls real fast.  Here's something for God's sake.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Good.  What's up?  I got one for you.  I always expected that he was...  The number nine was his code.  I figured for his campaign trail next time, he could do the Mambo number nine song.  A little bit of Julia in my life.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  That's what he's saying.  Or we could rework it and do client number nine.  Sir.  Mambo number nine.  Is Spitzer a Jewish guy?  Oh, what do you think?  Yeah.  Elliot Spitzer.  A platform designed to clean up New York. 
[02:13:30]  And extra large platform go-go boots to go with his matching purse and peacock feather  hat.  Re-elect client number nine for governor.  It's paid for by the OPNB Show.  I think I got a hooker.  How does Steve throw his own life into this?  He likes things pounded.  He likes to wear dresses.  Yeah.  He's a producer.  Right.  He's just taking everything from personal experience and shoehorning it into our Spitzer  bit.  You got it, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Let's go.  This is how we finish today. 
[02:14:00]  Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?  I miss it each night and day.  I know I'm not wrong.  Oh, God.  The feeling's getting stronger the longer I stay away.  Mr. Moss-colored vines, the tall sugar pines, where mackin' boys come to see.  Oh, mackin' boys.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  And I'd like to see the lazy Mrs. Zivvy hurrying into spring.  Where's Heinrich Himmler when you need him?  I miss the moon light on the bike.  A pale tune that fills the air.  I dream about my dreams blue.  Soon I'm wishin' that I was in the chair.  Hey, Wayne.  Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans? 
[02:15:00]  Cause that's where you left your home.  How about shortening this fucker?  And there's one.  Oh, my God, Adam.  Right on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  The saxophone solo.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[02:15:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, creating poverty, does that include CBS and how they pay or  don't pay for the rundown?  Push, Steve.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes the rundown for onaradio.com.  He hasn't been paid since December or something.  And Steve doesn't have a lot of money.  He could definitely use the money that CBS owes him.  Why don't they do the right thing and pay the damn guy?  The Pope's against poverty.  I hear that.  Oh, back to Billy Crystal.  Come on.  Big finish. 
[02:16:00]  Big finish.  What?  Mr. Bush, can you dig this?  I knew that you could.  Christ almighty.  Is he doing a kick line thing here?  You should only get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  And there's one.  Jesus.  I've been the ones I care for more than I miss.  More than.  New only. 
[02:16:30]  Boba.  God.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  And then the people are like, they don't want to applaud this.  They do not want to applaud this.  Oh, wife.  Feed into him.  This should have been dead, deafening silence.  The guy who made my giant is still getting standing O's for that crap. 
[02:17:00]  Here's the Pope.  We got to get out of here.  But Jimmy said the Pope sounds a little strange.  Lighten a little.  We are invited to contemplate Jesus as an example of how to conduct our day.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But it does sound a bit, yeah.  Yeah.  That's chicken.  Good.  Yeah.  Touch my monkey.  Yes.  He is struck against temptation.  May this time of purification prepare our hearts.  Yes.  To celebrate the saving mistress of the dead. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  And the rest of the past.  Jones.  Yeah.  I wish you all a pleasant stay in Rome and a pleasant son.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Jimmy, you nailed that one.  A little Paul Lynn going there.

Just croaking on the bed from auto erotic asphyxiation or something.  Face down in a peep booth with like a little bit of egg salad on his face and an ascot.  Oh, can I plug one more thing?  Yeah.

[02:30:00]  because we're pointing  out that they might  be different  from being normal  and we'll have to  go to Moe Howard  hair  with that thing  also I was riding  in the car  the other day  with my wife  she was kind of  reading the book  sounds dull  we were playing  the Kenny  and Patty  the John Travolto  there's no God  yeah  and anyway  she looked up  and said  are they making fun  of Down's children  again  again  yeah we do a lot  she sounds like  a fun chick

[02:31:30]  at home today  did you  we're out of shape  so me bringing up  that whole fact  is just stupid  because I got  everything wrong  yeah I can't  certain  it was Jeff Buckley  and it was because  the idol guy  sang it last night  nothing to do  with Jeff Healy  and his death  well you should  just say you  read it the times  right on a placemat  at a restaurant  so much for him  being good for accuracy  oh fuck  I thought I hung up  on you already  shit  you got another line in  thank you sir  I appreciate it  let's say hi to Fred  in Maine  Fred  my name is the Pope 
[02:32:00]  and I like to wear dresses  yeah he's a little  we gotta get some  German audio of him  absolutely  yeah  good  Dave in Jersey  Dave  yeah I got a question  for you guys  with Spitzer  and the governor  and stuff  have you guys seen  the look his wife  is giving him  yes  in all the videos  and the pictures  on like on Drudge  and CNN  looks like  oh my god  you know  if I was Spitzer  I mean he's a billionaire  he comes from a lot of money  I would just leave 
[02:32:30]  I wouldn't even  wouldn't you just leave  I would go  yeah  style  like  nothing good could come of this  your career is done  walk away  your marriage is done  just walk away  no statement  nothing  you just leave  and go  you pack up some things  they walk in  to see what the governor  is doing  and it's like  wow he just left  yeah  the governor  just left  hold on a minute  now we got more info  about the Jeff Healy  Jeff Buckley  American Idol  blind cancer thing  Dave in Halifax 
[02:33:00]  what's up boys  hey  good evening  yeah just  Dreadlock did it man  but it's Leonard Cohen  who just got  actually put on  the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  there the other day  he's the dude  that did that  hallelujah crap  Leonard Cohen  alright  Jeff Healy's actually  from my hometown here  so  alright  I think  I think we can  finally end this  hopefully  who cares  he's a Molly Hatchet song  yeah how are we gonna  keep this going  I think now  that's the end of it  Leonard Cohen  came up with that song  right  so then why is 
[02:33:30]  Jeff Healy  number one  huh  because he's dead  no Jeff Healy's  not number one  I said that  I effed up the whole thing  oh you did  I thought the callers were  no I thought  Jeff Healy  it was Jeff Buckley  and it was Jeff Buckley  because American Idol  sang the song  but it's not a Jeff Buckley song  it's a Leonard Cohen song  holy shit  that's where we're at  with that whole thing  okay so Jeff Healy's fucked  he's dead  and he's not number one  no one cares about him  no  I was wondering why  that would be because  he's been dead for a couple of weeks 
[02:34:00]  yeah  it's not like the old blind cunt  just kicked off yesterday  I say that with love  that'd be great  if you're blind  like he was  and all you donate to science  are your eyes  yeah  donor card  you know  there's two jaspers  you can play with  I'm an aggie  yeah play jacks  with these worthless things  fucking put them on your  put them on your mantle  they'll work just as well  there as they did  in my fucking head  these two useless orbs

[02:35:00]  Kenneth Pinion  yes  I have not seen it  I heard it was on one of the channels  last night  it sucked  the documentary  it was awful  because they don't name them  these fucking cowards  I'm sorry  I interrupted you  it was  yeah  they blocked everyone's name  that was on it  they gave them all  just what they did  for a living  and that was it  huh  so it wasn't worth  even calling about  because it wasn't even worth  this discussion  please waste the time  I just wanted to call  and tell you that 
[02:35:30]  alright  thank you sir  thanks guys  actually you saved me some time  because I was thinking about  watching that dumb thing  it was just weak  yeah  I mean it's worth seeing  just to see the  like they give some information  but the fact that they didn't name him  annoys me  because what's his name  they play the audio  of Tom Likas  and the guy's name is  and then they stop it  it's like what are you doing  why shouldn't he be named  he's not a child  he's a fucking  he's a silly goose  yeah let's say hi to  Lunchbox and PA  we continue with Jeff Healy

[02:36:30]  because he wasn't really  putting his all into Jimsy  so why do the music  I wanna talk to the punk rockers  so you don't do any  Oscar Madison  it's always Quincy  it's always Quincy  my life is Quincy  why would you do Oscar Madison  when you can do Quincy  come on  this is no accidental death  I got the latest on  Mr. Spitzer  the latest  yeah this is all we got so far  impeachment proceeding  Republican set deadline  for governor's resignation  so they've given him  a chance to do the right thing 
[02:37:00]  and resign  if not  it's gonna get ugly  if governor  Elliot Spitzer  opts to roll the dice  and not resign  state Republican leadership  may force him to go all in  and call for his impeachment  from office  according to state assembly  gambling analogies there  sources told CBS2HD  in high def  surely after it was reported  huge dick  that the governor  was linked to a prostitution ring  that he would hand in  his resignation  which could happen  within the next 36 hours 
[02:37:30]  state assembly  in James Tedisco  told CBS2HD  huge dick  that he spoke with  Lieutenant Governor Patterson  Monday evening  and that the two discussed  Patterson taking on  a new role of leadership  Patterson spoke to a photo  on the wall  and said  that he thought  that it was forthcoming  as Patterson spoke  into the ear end  of the phone  he said  before falling down 
[02:38:00]  a staircase  he said  oh that's right  Patterson shook hands  with a stove  and high-fived  the hamburger helper  before he said  Patterson took his shit  on a big wheel  and then tried to flush  by hitting the wheel  should have quit  while I was ahead  that's still good  Spitzer's ego  is too big to quit  stupid Mr. Burns  look-alike  he's got a little  young Mr. Burns 
[02:38:30]  in him right  re-elect Governor  Elliot Spitzer  during his time  as Attorney General  Elliot Spitzer  was tough on  white-collar crime  and securities fraud  while at the  Emperor's Club  he enjoyed having  his ball bag tickled  with the feathers  of exotic waterfowl  re-elect client  number nine  for Governor  paid for by  the Opie and Anthony  show  very nice  client number nine  Dickie Punchcock  writes  Dickie Punchcock  the  it's been a while  the Dickie Punchcock  from Whackbag  here's the latest  on Spitzer  he's a man that 
[02:39:00]  loves snatch  back to you Opie  hmm  pretty obvious  I'm just looking  I can't  I got 12 year old  dwarf brothers  on the Today Show  I'm just looking  look at these  little freakish  dwarf brothers  they're not brothers  though  it's a guy and a girl  yeah but it said  brothers  what's wrong  no that's a guy  it's a brother  yeah that's two  oh yeah it is  it looks like a little  dwarf Hanson  I have more of a problem  that his brother  looks Asian  yeah  exactly  his cock's actually 
[02:39:30]  regular size  what is it  freak show day  he's 41  little kid  it's like 5  he's 43 years old  and he's got  the dwarfism  we gotta help  someone out here  Steve  Pennsylvania  yes  yeah  good morning boys  how you doing  good  I'm just reading  about Elliot here  a little bit  this morning  and I was just  wondering if Jimmy  could kind of  fill in the gaps  here a little bit  because I know  he's kind of  an expert on this  stuff  okay 
[02:40:00]  they're saying  here  he had done  enough business  with the service  to have $400  in credit  and a reputation  for unsafe  requests  he even wound up  paying Kristen  an extra  $1600  to restock  his credit  what the hell  does that mean  it just means  that they had  a running tab  there's like a bar tab  but obviously  very discreet  at the escort service  and he had some  extra money  can I jump in here  too  they said  he had $400  in credit  that means  this guy  was a chiseler  he was probably  like figuring out  exactly how long  that the woman 
[02:40:30]  was in his hotel room  said oh you're  20 minutes short  of an hour here  I'm taking it  off my tab  I'm gonna round down  I think he had it  in his tab  and when any  normal person  probably would have  just because he  can't do anything  with $400  at that service  it was too expensive  so instead of  just tipping the girl  the $400  he left it  in his account  right  well I mean  for the next time  cheapo  for next time  but he's got to  deposit more anyway  so why not  I'm sure 
[02:41:00]  it's an interest  bearing account  oh I'm sure  a high yield  high yield  high yield  11%  and one fucking  humiliating scandal  one stone faced  wife  hey Steve  anything else  yeah I was just  wondering if you  could kind of  fill in  what did they  figure out  as unsafe  request  is that like  no bag  yes he asked  to not wear a  condom  and he asked  her  oh yeah we  couldn't talk  about it on the  other side  we're thinking  blowjob without a  condom  probably ass  fucking  with no  condom 
[02:41:30]  yeah it's  hard to  we're hoping  it's an ass  fucking  yeah I'm hoping  it was an ass  fucking  yeah we're  really all in  with the ass  fucking  and I'm hoping  he wanted her  to wear a  magic Johnson  jersey while  he did it  we fucked her  in the shitter  I think more  is going to  come out man  yeah  more details  I treated you  like a son  Elliot  alright thank you  sir  we got to go to  Jeremy in Jersey  Jeremy  good morning  shit dicks  hi  I'm interested  to see what 
[02:42:00]  Lieutenant Governor  Patterson's vision  for the future  of New York  is  meh meh  vision  meh  got it  meh  he's blind  meh  his  Steven S. from  Bayshore  hey Ope  tell Anthony  the term dwarves  is no longer  acceptable  the new word  everyone is using  is kickables  oh kickables  hey speaking  of retards  you think the  Elliot Spitzer  thing is the  story of the day  it's gotta be  I got story of the  day  which is way 
[02:42:30]  bigger than  Elliot Spitzer  outrage over  parents decision  to have  Down Syndrome  child  undergo  cosmetic  surgery  wow  they don't want  him to look  like a  retard  listen to this  this is by far  the story of the  day  the parents of  a girl with  Down Syndrome  have caused a  public outcry in  the UK by  subjecting their  daughter to  cosmetic surgery  to improve her  appearance  why not  Georgia 
[02:43:00]  Bussey  underwent radical  and painful  cosmetic surgery  three times by  the age of five  so she could fit  in with her  peers  why would  anyone be  outraged about  that when all  they're doing is  making her life a  little bit easier  what fucking  purist people are  what fucking  assholes  although when you  look in that face  usually you have  no expectations  now if there's  plastic surgery  and then you  talk to it  and then you  get one of those  you know  you're like  oh Jesus  you bamboozled me 
[02:43:30]  there's a woman  applying for the  job  which one  the one eating  the pencils  but she looks  like a supermodel  yeah what the  hell  I'm a little  confused here  parents of another  girl with Down  Syndrome  button nose  and a brain  to match  parents of another  girl with Down  Syndrome told the  paper that they  were also considering  altering her  appearance in the  future so she  could be more  accepted  in the future  the parents hit 
[02:44:00]  back because a lot  of people are  complaining here  saying that no one  complained when  normal children had  their ears pinned  back  are they pinned  back ears of kids  it's a little bit of  difference  I know you do that  to a dog  I thought that was  ages ago they  did that  they had her  tongue shaved  they stretch midgets  now they do this  thing with the  leg  they stretch the  bone  it takes years  it's painful  painful surgery  and they put holes  in your legs  and they put these  big braces  and they take a  big wrench  and every so often  they just go  click  and like crank 
[02:44:30]  you up another  little fraction  of an inch  I know a little  something about  that too  you know that  midgets in the  midget community  look down upon that  although they  should be looking  up at everything  but they get  pissed off if  these people  attempt to get  taller  screw them  because they're  saying you should  be proud of  being a midget  you should live  with it  you should learn  not to kill  yourself  it's as proud  as you can get  this goes on  any other small 
[02:45:00]  handicapped group  we can pound on  today  we really are  bullying cunts  are we  we stink  we go after  the tough targets  we shut our  mouth about  spitzer until  he stepped in  duty  they are tough  targets too  they're so small  they're hard to hit  well Jimmy  mentioned the  tongue  in the first  procedure Jimmy  George's tongue  was reduced  to stop it  from protruding  good  according to the  paper  always getting  sunburned 
[02:45:30]  how blithering  do you want to  look  a tongue  hanging out  of your mouth  makes you look  stupid  it really is  like the  hallmark card  greeting card  of stupidity  big sheepdog  tongue  that really is  so that should  be numero uno  on the list  yeah  um  then folds  of skin  were removed  from the inner  corners of her  eyes to take  away the  slantiness  characteristic 
[02:46:00]  of down  syndrome  yeah  folds of skin  yeah  yeah  that little  slanty eyes  they get  and finally  she had  surgery  to stop  her ears  from sticking  out  and then  this family  said society  often judges  people on the  way they look  society's not  going to change  overnight so  Georgia has to  fit into society  rather than  society fitting  into the way  she is  you saw her  mouth shut  the second she  opens that  thing up  the jigs up  yeah  and she's  going to  move to  LA because  it's easy  to spell

[02:48:00]  bow-legged  walk they  do  yeah  this is the  pope  obviously in  German now  only one  that doesn't  make this  language sound  like monstrous  yeah  maybe he's 
[02:48:30]  speaking  maybe because  German is such  a harsh  language he's  speaking that  lilting way  just so he  won't come off  as a Nazi  sounding all  you know  full of piss and  vinegar  yeah  Hitler knew how  to speak German  didn't he  yeah  so he was  screaming  hollering  nodding  he knew how to  accent certain  words  yeah  yes he did  fist comes down

[02:57:00]  yeah Lee's great  he did a lot  for this business  and he did a lot  for XM  yeah  and it sucks  that he's leaving  but he's definitely  not being forced out  I want to make that  perfectly clear  because all that  merger crap  so  oh here it is  Lee Abrams  resigns from XM  XM Satellite Radio's  chief creative officer  Lee Abrams  has resigned  from the company  today according  to a letter  sent out  to employees  this morning  Abrams  who joined  XM in 1998  wow  that's when  no one believed  in satellite  can't believe 
[02:57:30]  he's that old  this guy has a vision  will be part  of a new company  starting in April  further details  on this next  Endeavor  will reportedly  be available  tomorrow  Endeavor  is with  Lee Abrams  Endeavor  and then you get  then you get  the bullshit  statement from  the bullshit  exec  in this case  Eric Logan  oh shit  he's the bullshit  executive  you know  you've read this  crap many times  and here it is  it is with  mixed emotions  that I announced  to the company 
[02:58:00]  that Lee Abrams  has resigned  mixed emotions  I'm happy  and glad  it's a little  mixed  what's the  mixed emotions  happy for him  sad to see him  go  is that the  corporate bullshit  no actually  it's jealous  bullshit  he's like  sad that he's  going and  actually getting  a job  right  and I don't  know  Logan might  be out on  his ass  yeah  Logan's still  waiting for  his boat  to come in  yeah  that's where  the sadness  part comes  in  Lee's impact  on XM  and the entire  satellite radio  industry would  be impossible 
[02:58:30]  to capture  in an email  Lee's gonna  get a job  bagging groceries  till he hangs  himself in a  halfway house  carve his  initials on a  fucking beam  creep  world's a little  too fast for me  yeah  Logan went  all out for  Lee Abrams  announcement  there you go  thank you  we got it  I don't know  maybe I'll just  rob the grocery  store  maybe I'll just  rob XM  maybe I'll shoot  Eric Logan  and they'll put me

[02:59:30]  you old bastard  while Logan  I saw a car  once  it was a little  too fast  for me  good  Logan spent  at least 10  minutes on the  big email  to the company  on Lee Abrams  resignation  because it  continues  at least 10  minutes  it continues  with some  terrific stuff  for a guy  that gave  his soul  to XM  for the last  10 years  so far  he gave us  it is with  mixed emotions  that I  announced  to the  company  that Lee  Abrams  has resigned  then he  goes on  to say  Lee's 
[03:00:00]  impact  on XM  and the  entire  satellite  radio  industry  would be  impossible  to capture  in an  email  that's  called  laziness  that's  called  I bet  you can  give it  a whirl  that's  called  I really  don't feel  like spending  the next  hour  drafting  this  email  it's  impossible  to  capture  everything  this  gentleman  has done  for the  industry  because I'm  much too  tired  to type  exactly  my 11th  bourbon  it's hard  to type  with your  forehead  I can't 
[03:00:30]  possibly do  that because  I'm a  beaten man  and I'm just  praying that  someone gets  me out of  this hellhole  that I've  been in for  the last  year with  this merger  crap  well it's  impossible to  capture  in an  email  however  everyone  in our  company  knows  that  Lee's  vision  and  creative  force  is a  key  reason  why  XM  is as  successful  as we  are  today  that's  right  being  bought  by  Sirius  with the  stock price  down  that's  wonderful  stock price  is at  all time  low  there's a  billion  dollars  in  that  button

[03:01:30]  are grateful  to have  had Lee  as one  of our  founding  programmers  and architect  of our  programming  philosophy  the  architect  his  contributions  are too  numerous  to enumerate  I'm guessing  they found  pot in his  office  something  he had to  resign  he's  fucking  he's  client  number  eight  he's  client  fucking  eight  Lee's  last day  with XM  will be  sometime  in the  next  three  weeks  okay  if  they're  letting  them  stay  around  a little  bit  that  means  it's  not  too bad  and then

[03:13:00]  or a  gentleman  hey big  spender  give us  your money  that's  wonderful  golly  isn't that  wonderful  hey who do  you think is  going to win  Mississippi  who are you  voting for  Otto  or is that a  private question  like the  Obama  he's just  not black  enough  you know  you need a  scary black  prison muscles  you know  don't you think  a scary  you know  you're going 
[03:13:30]  the other way  then  yeah  like a lot  of people  saying  he's like a  golfer  I don't know  what that guy  he's safe  black  yeah  you know  I don't know  I don't think  it makes a  difference who's  elected because  nothing's gonna  fucking change  I mean  the fact that  yeah the fact that  people still think  that voting  has any impact  at all  the only impact  you can have  is a revolution  an assassination  that makes a  change  I think  I think  Obama  would make  a difference  I think people  would actually  it would be a  change  really  yeah because 
[03:14:00]  I mean  because Whitey  is so guilt  ridden  yeah  that I think  a lot more  of his policies  would pass  than if just  some old white  guys in there  and they could  always vote  against it  nothing ever  gets done  in Washington  anymore  if Congress  likes something  the president  vetoes it  yeah  if the president  writes something  Congress doesn't  vote on it  and it doesn't  go through  but I think  Obama writes  something  and then everyone  goes  we have to  vote  yes  or else  we'll look  like we're  racists  oh no  and they would 
[03:14:30]  just let shit  through  what  no fucking  way  no way  you don't see  this country  as being the  most guilt ridden  white people  on the face  of the earth  I'm not either  that makes  two of us  Otto  and George  although he's  Wood  that makes  three  everyone else  is a liberal  pieces of shite  you know  regular Joe  has a comment  okay  regular Joe  regular Joe  well you know  let the big  muckety mucks  work it out  what do I know  I like regular Joe

[03:36:30]  scared I don't  know  yeah  oh the video  was also removed  from ripevideos.com  what's the  what the fuck  is going on  with the internet  now they're  starting to get  pussied  yep  pussified  well as big  corporations buy  out these  viral sites  you're subject  to whatever  rules and  regulations  those huge  corporations  that's why  the internet  is so great  is because  you get away  with more  than network  TV  and cable TV  you can  mock shooting  somebody  but you can't  put pudding  under your nose  I mean  that's  whoa don't  say that 
[03:37:00]  because now  they're going  to say  see Jimmy  admitted it  on the show  today  but meaning  that's the  beauty of that  video  you never see  the fucking  diaper being  filled  that's the  fucking  yeah  this is not  you fucking  assholes out there  you fucking  corporate  faggots  they're always  going to  move the  line on you  so you know  you can't  they're just  cowards  they're a bunch  of people who  know nothing  about being  funny  they know  nothing about  being talented  they're fucking  they're just  fucking  just douchebags  and ties  they're all  Elliot Spitzer 
[03:37:30]  they're fucking  nerds who don't  live the way  they fucking  expect everybody  else to live  here's what  happens too  there's a site  out there  that will  get popular  just say it's  some video  site  it'll get  popular  because there's  such outrageous  cool videos  to watch on  there  then a big  company will  notice  wow  this site  gets a lot  of hits  I'm gonna  buy it  then we're  gonna put  commercials on  it  and we're  gonna eliminate  all the good  shit that people  went there to  see  and then when  it fails  they wonder  what happened 
[03:38:00]  why  it was such  a popular  site  before we  bought it  but no one  will take  responsibility  or admit  the fact  that they  just didn't  leave it  the fuck  alone  they gotta  fuck with  it  no it's a  bummer  we have a  really good  relationship  with break.com  and they  refused to put it  on their front  page  because they've  been bought  up by a  big corporation  you can't blame  other guys  because if  you're sitting  in your  basement  fucking up  with your  computer  and you  make a  website  and a year  later the 
[03:38:30]  thing's worth  three billion  dollars  I'd sell  it like  if it was  my mother  I'd sell  I'd sell  her for  that much  for fucking  why are  people like  are they  afraid of  like complaining  somebody's  gonna complain  by phone  or I don't  know what  it is  you can't  sue them  it's the  internet  they don't  want to be  the thing  is they're  companies  it's not  just like  some company  bought it  and said  yeah I own  this website  it's like  I own  this website  and I own  Paramount Pictures  and I own  Blockbuster Video  I don't want  my product  linked with  diaper shit  comedy 
[03:39:00]  so it ruins  everything  break.com  thought it was  a great video  they laughed  they said it was  hilarious  but they can't  put it on  their front page  because they've  been bought  up by a big  company  break.com  if you do  a quick search  one of their  most popular  videos is the  famous girl  getting diarrhea  in the hot tub  I think if you  search break.com  all time  most viewed  videos  I believe it's  right up there  in the top 10 
[03:39:30]  or something  a shit video  this one  innocent little  mustache  there was no  ingesting  nothing like  that with this  video  it's a shame  John Waters  had that  poodle shit  eating scene  and now he's  a big Broadway  baby  we had John Waters  in  he was really  really cool  and interesting  absolutely  bit of a weirdo  but really  strange  I have his  comb  yeah  you do  really 
[03:40:00]  that's between  us  keep it under  your hats  that's what  regular Joe  says  keep it under  your hats  here's your  hat  what's your  hurry  fuck off  regular Joe  time for  today's talker  and okay  you know  when you leave  for work  or simply  get out of  the house  to run errands  do you ever  worry your pets  are going to  get bored  while you're  away  it's never  dawned on me  but anyways  that's something  you may never  thought of  like me  but it's  something a  valley man  has dedicated  a huge portion  of his life  actually the last  seven years  all new this  morning  Sarah Kallstrom  tells you  about a radio 
[03:40:30]  station  for cats  only  yes  a little  Kiki D  on Cat  Galaxy  a strange  premise  maybe  an internet  radio station  meant just  for cats  all cats  all the time  the idea  came to  Noel Rosen  almost seven  years ago  when he felt  one of his  cats seem  bored  he put in  a CD  and the rest  is history  music started  playing  ISIS laid  down and  relaxed  and Cat  Galaxy  was born  your fruit  mouse farts  the meow  mix  fucking  theme song 
[03:41:00]  over and  over  what is a  cat  it doesn't  matter  I hope  it's the  sound of a  fucking  screeching  car tire  instead of  thud  let's play  the same  thing  they won't  mind  Rosen calls  this his  studio  where he  broadcasts live  two hours  every morning  two hours  every night  we've got  the Wednesday  night cat  attack  we've got  the Thursday  night purr  party and  the Friday  night feline  frenzy  nothing  gets on  the air  that hasn't  been cat  approved  we have to  throw away  the human  way of  thinking  that everything  is meant  for humans 
[03:41:30]  cats I think  know what  they want to  hear  this is  scary  three million  people who have  visited his  website over the  past seven  years  three what  this is why  this is why  the Iraqs  fucking hate  us  we have  a fucking  radio for  cats over  here  they have  nothing to  eat over  in fucking  Iraq  no wonder  they hate  us  you know  I'm just  thinking  if we get  fired again  this is the  only place  we have left  to go  Opie and  Anthony on  cat radio  that would  suck  that's right  here it is
