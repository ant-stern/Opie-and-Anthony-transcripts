<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Jim Norton, and later Anthony Cumia, heavily focused on the indefinite postponement of their bus tour.  Opie vehemently criticized SiriusXM management, specifically Gary and Steve Blatter, for incompetence and lack of support, detailing planning failures and the inexplicable omission of "Club Soda Kenny," an experienced touring expert, from the logistical team.  The hosts also discussed Jim Norton's upcoming Boston comedy special taping (which Opie decided to attend),  a previous comedy special opener featuring "Ozzy on the toilet and the tranny," and Shane Smith's (Vice) North Korea trip with Dennis Rodman.  They lamented SiriusXM's lack of visual support for their show, contrasting it with the success of Opie's YouTube channel. This segment included "F.U." calls and plugs for Billy the Bassman and Quentin Tarantino's birthday.

The discussion continued with the hosts and in-studio guest "Literal Jimmy,"  recounting their reactions (laughter) to the bus tour cancellation, highlighting a pattern of mismanagement.  "Literal Jimmy" initially thought the cancellation was a joke.  The hosts used vulgar language to express their disdain for those responsible.  Vinny, a previous guest, was mentioned as sharing their disbelief.  They contrasted the ease of booking their Boston trip with the bus tour's numerous obstacles, again highlighting Kenny's overlooked expertise (from his work with Andrew Dice Clay). The conversation then meandered through several tangents: Moses Gates's particularly pungent fart, Dionne Warwick's financial troubles, their desire for a show mascot, further complaints about management, Amanda Knox's case, and graphic descriptions of violent animal killing videos (horse, deer) reminiscent of "Faces of Death."  Nick DiPaolo joined the conversation late in this segment.

Nick DiPaolo's in-studio appearance led to discussions about hunting deer (methods, potential injuries), graphic videos (a beheading, a road rage incident with a potential shooting), a sinkhole rescue compared to the JFK Jr. plane crash response, and a listener-sent Nazi flag (made in Taiwan).  They also discussed videos by “Bobo Loco,” featuring his attempts to film his dog, Mr. Malonagen, and played clips of Paul Anka angrily directing his band.

The show then shifted to a reaction to a young man's supposedly phony anti-rape message and a graphic description of a Chinese bus driver narrowly escaping injury in a lamppost accident.  This transitioned to discussions of viral videos (Harlem Shake), parody video ideas, Tiger Woods's golf comeback and the media's focus on his past infidelities, and a phone interview with Mark Burnett (producer of "The Bible"), discussing its production, popularity, and Satan depiction controversy.  A Nick DiPaolo clip detailing a past altercation with Boomer Esiason was played, followed by the hosts’ reminiscences and music discussions (Burt Bacharach).

The broadcast concluded with the Jim Norton Advice Show.  Callers sought advice on erectile dysfunction medication, a wife's affair with the town electrician, pursuing a threesome, sleeping with a friend's ex-girlfriend, leaving the army for broadcasting, being in love with one's 22-year-old niece, a brother's hasty Venezuelan marriage, potential addiction in an unborn child, and a wife's two-and-a-half-year affair with her boss. Norton provided advice based on personal experiences and observations, interspersed with commercials for "Masked Sexual Flavors" and Adam & Eve.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice show.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If someone finds it, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Symphony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good fucking morning.  Good morning.  Ant's on his way in.  We'll be here at, what, seven?  I don't know.  That's the kind of thing.  No worries.  Good morning, Jim Norton.  Hello, Opie.  I want to start by asking you a question.  Sure.  I just take the awful things in my life and I make them come.  You want to guess who just booked a trip to Boston? 
[00:02:00]  Are you going to Boston?  That's right.  Oh, good, man.  Good.  I'm happy to hear that.  I got a reset.  Good, good.  I got a reset from Club Soda Kenny for an e-ticket for an Amtrak ride to Boston.  Are you going with us?  Oh, no.  We're going today.  Okay, we're going.  Now all I have to do is tell the wife.  She'll be up soon.  I'll tell her.  She'll be cool, actually.  Yeah, I'm going to Boston.  I'm going to see you tape your special.  I'm very happy to hear that.  Oh, by the way, that means I won't be here Friday.  I probably should have told the guys. 
[00:02:30]  I'm going to Boston.  Hey.  Yes.  I think you'll enjoy the opening.  The opening?  Oh, you got another opening?  Is it better than the other opening?  Because the other opening was fantastic.  Hard to say.  It's all subjective, but I like it.  Really?  Yeah, I'm very happy.  The other opening killed.  Yeah.  With Ozzy on the turlet and the tranny.  Yeah.  But you didn't know it was a tranny.  It was the big reveal.  Yeah, this is much different.  Much different?  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  A little classier?  Yeah.  Sure.  I can't wait, though. 
[00:03:00]  I really classied it up in the last year.  I've been going back and forth, but I'm like, yeah, I want to fucking go to Boston, man.  Yeah, we'll have dinner.  We'll have dinner.  We'll go check out the taping, and then, I don't know, maybe look up some old friends  up there.  We'll see.  I'm bummed I can't stay a couple of days.  I mean, I love Boston.  I love hanging out there.  I love eating there.  I love going out.  It's one of my favorite places in the world is Boston.  Yeah, I would move there tomorrow.  Absolutely.  I would go back there tomorrow.  No problem.  I really did like my time up there.  I have, by the way, I think on each show, 40 tickets on each show have been released, 
[00:03:30]  but I got the information sent to me.  Noon today, you can get them.  There's comps that wind up.  I never use all my comps, ever.  And then they just put them up for sale, but they have to reconfigure seating to do it.  Well, you better save a ticket for me.  Yeah.  I don't want to sit in the audience all awkwardly.  Why not?  I think I want to check this one out from the side stage.  I don't want to do the awkward wave this time.  It's very nice when you do that for us, but it's just awkward. 
[00:04:00]  It's become a tradition.  Stand up.  I know it's a tradition.  Dude, the first show last time in Cleveland, I was looking at you, Aunt Danny, and whoever  else was there, and the whole time I could see you guys.  Did you want to spit on us?  No, I wanted to fucking spit on whoever didn't do the lights.  No, I know.  That's why I said that.  Oh, yeah.  I was so bummed, man.  I was like, fuck.  I was trying to go, hey, I'm looking right at you.  How are you?  I'm fucking crying.  I'm not supposed to see your friends.  You were pretty sad.  You were sad in Cleveland, but it worked out in the end. 
[00:04:30]  It was okay, yeah.  I love the people I'm working with this time.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I'm very, very happy, and I feel very, very ready.  Very cool.  I'm not sick of the material yet, so.  I forgot to tweet just before I went to bed.  I wanted to tweet that we had a bus trip update for everybody.  Yes.  There's a lot of, there's a buzz out there.  Opie and Anthony hitting the road for a week.  Going to stop in, what, four places?  Yeah.  I think it's Branson, Missouri.  You got the Nashville.  You got the Memphis.  And a big show.  And then Austin, Texas. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, so I wanted to tweet to get everyone listening to the radio today for the big Opie and Anthony  bus trip update.  So after the show, you had Steve Blatter and the Radio Wizard.  They walked in all confident after our Shane Smith interview from Vice, a guy that's been  traveling the world.  Everywhere he's been.  I don't even know how you make travel plans to go to half these places he goes to.  You have to have somebody behind the scenes who cares about it and who just does it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, but how do you book flights to these places?  It's crazy.  They sneak in, man.  He knows how to do it.  It's weird.  And how do you book hotels in the middle of West Africa?  I don't know.  Or how do you get...  Somebody said, we got to get the Chicago Bulls into North Korea.  Right.  And they got Dennis Rodman to go to North Korea.  They got someone to hang out with Kim Jong-un.  Right.  Why wouldn't any other Bulls go with the guy? 
[00:06:00]  They're probably scared or maybe the PR is better because he really is an enemy of the  state.  Yeah, Shane Smith explained that.  Un is a big fan of the Chicago Bulls.  They got a basketball supposedly signed by Michael Jordan, but I don't know what to believe  as far as North Korea goes.  And he has tapes of the old Chicago Bulls and it's one of his things.  And Shane Smith got, yeah, Dennis Rodman to go there.  That's how that whole thing came about.  But I was thinking...  The father was a big fan, I think.  I guess he is by default, but his dad...  Oh, I'm sure he is.  Yeah.  Because my dad was a huge Knicks fan.  So I became a huge Knicks fan.  So I'm sure that's how it works. 
[00:06:30]  And I was just wondering, the other Bulls, what else are they doing?  Steve Kerr should have went.  Paxton should have went.  You know what it is, Jordan?  Guys like that have too much to lose.  Well, Jordan's not going to go, but I'm thinking of some of the lesser players.  What else?  B.J. Armstrong, what is he doing?  He should have went and checked out North Korea with Dennis Rodman.  Or Pippen.  Pippen.  I think Pippen's in that category.  What the hell is he doing these days?  Get your name back in the spotlight?  You're hanging out in North Korea?  They all have millions, though.  They might just be afraid that Kim Jong-un, like if... 
[00:07:00]  Well, Dennis Rodman's crazy.  That's what it is.  You know, there's no surprise that he went.  He's nuts.  He's nuts.  And he's trying to keep his name out there, and he's done a pretty good job with it.  And they could just keep you.  They literally could just keep you.  And the U.S. would have to go to war to get you back.  Right.  Like they did with that filmmaker.  But if they keep you, would they at least get you girls?  Not the kind you like.  Really?  There's no big butt girls over there in fucking Korea.  Oh, well, but they should set you up with some girls at least.  No.  I don't know.  They might get you one. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Nice Korean girl.  Yeah.  Nice traditional Korean girl.  Yeah.  But he said that everywhere in the documentary, he said everywhere you go, it feels like people  are being...  It's like a play.  They're putting out a play for you.  Right.  Like he said yesterday, you're not interacting.  Yeah, you're not really seeing the real North Korea.  Although he came the closest, I'm sure.  Shane Smith from Vice.  How fucking interesting was that guy?  I loved him.  He's the best, man.  I thought about him all day yesterday.  Yeah.  That was a great hour of radio, just him telling stories about the places he's been.  Well, we have an update on the big Opie and Anthony bus trip, and E-Rock, do you have 
[00:08:00]  that clip?  I know it was a last minute find.  Do you have it, though?  I'm trying to find it.  I can't find it.  Well, people are going to have to take my word for this.  Yeah.  We know you've said it.  All right.  Because I want to either be proven wrong or right today.  No, you absolutely said it.  Yeah.  A few weeks ago, I said the trip would absolutely not happen.  Yeah.  Just because I know how this place operates.  I said, there's no fucking way it's happening.  I haven't even discussed plans with my wife and my family, because I know it's not happening.  Because she asked me, like, well, if you're going to wait for a week, we've got to figure 
[00:08:30]  some shit out.  I'm like, yeah, but it's not going to happen.  You know, they've told us shit over the years, and it just doesn't happen.  So I don't worry about stuff until I really believe it's going to happen.  She's like, all right.  She was cool about it.  Um, so, uh, the Radio Wizard and Steve Blatter walked in yesterday, and they go, hey, would  you mind putting off the bus trip until late summer, early fall?  And I just laughed at him.  I openly laughed at him.  You were there, right, Sam?  It was so funny watching you.  Like, I didn't even want to give any hints to what had just happened on the after show. 
[00:09:00]  I wanted to wait until today.  Right.  Because you did.  Like, he goes, we're thinking about pushing it back to, like, maybe late summer, early  fall.  Right.  And there was this silence.  And then you just kind of looked at your phone and just went, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then I went, it's like this shitty, I told you so.  I knew this would happen.  You guys can't do anything.  You just gave me the segment number one for tomorrow. 
[00:09:30]  Well, you're missing the punchline, too, because then I looked at him and went, oh, man,  are you guys going to get a beating tomorrow?  I looked him right in the eye.  He's, uh, and said, you're going to get a beating tomorrow.  But this is why we bitch.  It's one fucking fumbled ball after another.  That's one bad goal I'd fucking stand after another.  Yeah, so now the bus trip has been put off.  And there was a nice buzz out there.  There was an excitement about it.  And now it's being put off to late summer, early fall, 
[00:10:00]  which means that it's just never going to happen  because they can't figure shit out around here.  Gary can't figure shit out around here.  I was in a meeting with Steve Blatter and Gary.  We were discussing the bus trip,  and he was already being panicky and trying to push it to June.  It was supposed to happen in April initially.  And Steve Blatter looked at Gary and said,  Why? Why June?  And he's like, Well, I just need more time.  To ramp up?  Yeah, and even Blatter's like, You don't need more time.  There's not much to do here. 
[00:10:30]  You get the buses.  The hotels will be cheap.  We'll find hotels wherever we go.  And now it's being put off to late summer, early fall.  Because they don't want to rely on Kenny.  And this is what Travis pointed out.  Before he goes, Nobody wants to ask Kenny.  And Kenny's done this shit.  He has done Dice bus tours.  He understands what to do, and he's an organized guy.  Yeah, you're asking a guy to organize a bus trip  that has never done it before.  And you've got a guy, Club Soda Kenny, who works for us,  who toured with Dice on buses. 
[00:11:00]  He knows all the ins and outs of traveling on a bus.  And they won't allow him to organize the trip.  They just won't.  They want to hold on to control and control.  Go ahead.  Fuck you.  Do what you want.  And then they were trying to downplay it.  I'm like, Look, man, you know, we've been talking about this idea  for over a year.  And they're like, No, we haven't.  I'm like, Trust me, we have.  It started with Greenstein in his office.  He came up with this idea a while ago.  And I said, Yeah, that would be cool.  Hit some cities we've never been to,  some areas we've never been to. 
[00:11:30]  So it's not happening.  And tell Scott we try to do what he asked.  He said he wanted to show out there more.  Right.  It's not happening.  I want to get you guys out there.  It's too complicated.  The corporate structure around here,  I don't know what the fuck goes on.  How hard could it be to throw us on a bus with some equipment?  I mean, at this point, you could broadcast from your phone.  Yeah.  You could use SoundCloud or something,  do breaks and just shove it up somewhere.  So it says you blew off the opportunity to do a show in Boston around your show 
[00:12:00]  because you're about to do the bus trip.  Right.  And then you...  No, we didn't blow that off.  I wanted to go to Boston with the radio show for Jim Norton.  I thought that was a no-brainer, too.  They never even got back to me.  I didn't mean you blew it off.  I meant they blew it off.  Yeah, they never even got back to me because that's an easy setup, too.  We got a huge fan base in Boston.  Jimmy's going up for a taping.  It's a no-brainer.  You leave after the show tomorrow, you broadcast the live Friday,  and we all leave Saturday morning.  Blumenreich had the venue.  He wanted us to do something. 
[00:12:30]  We had the Wilbur Theater if we wanted it.  It was probably an easy plug-in, too.  Yeah, of course.  Very easy.  But, I mean, it wasn't even a discussion because we got guys around us  that can't get things done, period.  Comedy Central just shot a bunch of stuff at the Wilbur.  The Wilbur Theater is fine to go, and I performed there.  It's a great venue.  Right.  We all could have had a great show there.  There's plenty of seats.  There's a bar.  I mean, it's everything you fucking need.  Right, yeah.  I'm sold out.  I don't need help with the tickets.  It wasn't about that.  It was about us going up and hanging out with the fucking fans in Boston. 
[00:13:00]  I know.  It's a good move for the show.  It looks cool as hell.  It's fun.  We go back to Boston.  We have an excuse to go to Boston.  The people certainly will come out for a live broadcast.  But, you know.  I mean, you said a few weeks ago, we've gone as far as we can here.  I absolutely believe that.  So, I mean, if we don't do something about it, then we're just fucking stupid, you know.  The only reason we haven't done anything about it to this point is because we really believe that things would turn around.  Yeah.  Because you look like an asshole. 
[00:13:30]  I thought about this.  You look like an asshole if you bitch day in and day out and nothing changes.  Because, you know, the reason why you bitch in the old days of radio, if you have a little power and some ratings behind you, it got things done.  But somewhere along the line, we just sound like complete assholes because we're bitching and nothing changes.  Nothing.  Except making good radio sometimes.  After a while, I know.  I actually agree with some of the haters.  It gets old.  It gets old bitching day in and day out.  But, you know, they're putting off the bus trip. 
[00:14:00]  And the funny thing is, this is how this is going to work.  They're going to put off the bus trip, meaning they're not even going to think about it for at least two months, three months.  And then they're going to do some last minute planning again.  And then it's going to fall apart again.  It's looking like end of September.  That's what they're saying now.  Yes.  What happened to end of summer?  Technically.  They said end of summer.  And I said, look, I don't want to.  I'm trying to free up my summer, you know, to enjoy myself a little bit.  So I said summer over, first week in September.  I mean, extremely early, early fall. 
[00:14:30]  Now it's late September.  Technically, the last day of summer is September the 21st.  Well, when he said summer, I was thinking summer like anyone else.  Well, that was your mistake.  July, August.  All right.  July and August is basically summer with a little May thrown in there.  Because, no.  End of September is what we're thinking.  I mean, June, July, August.  Yeah.  With a tiny bit of May.  Huh?  End of September.  The end of September now.  End of September.  It's the current time frame. 
[00:15:00]  What are we in now?  March, April, May, June, July, August.  Six more months.  Wait, wait.  April, May, June, July.  Wow.  Six more months is right.  Because it's the end of September.  You know, it's like they just put off the bus trip for six months?  Yeah.  Like to the point where they said people wanted to take vacation at the beginning of September.  That would be fine.  Because it's the end of September.  What a bunch of idiots.  I heard Troy Kwan had something to say in the meeting.  Oh, my God.  Troy Kwan was missing.  Well, I mean, the Radio Wizard lost our respect a really long time ago. 
[00:15:30]  But now he's losing the respect of the staff.  And that's not good.  It wasn't polite what he did.  What did he do?  Well, most of us have been in the studio.  But Troy was not in the studio when, you know, the announcement came to you guys that the bus trip was getting pushed back.  So Gary filled everybody in again.  And then Troy goes, so the bus tour is not happening in May?  And Gary goes, no.  And Troy goes, oh, that's good.  I mean, for the record, I knew it wasn't going to happen. 
[00:16:00]  I already booked vacation for May.  There you go.  There you go.  Because people have had it.  They're not being polite anymore.  They're looking at him like, what the fuck are you doing?  They just postponed it at six months.  I should know why it was necessary for Troy to use that opportunity to make the announcement that he had never had faith that this would happen.  Right.  We were a little over a month out from doing this thing.  And the fact that they won't get Kenny involved is what makes me so sick to my stomach, knowing that he could get it done, get it done better than they can. 
[00:16:30]  And he's just, you know, Kenny's a one man fucking cyborg machine.  He could just lock in, boom, boom.  But they don't want to have to deal with him being right and them being wrong and going, okay, well, we could, you know.  Kenny delivers information sometimes very dry.  Right.  He's like a book with like a voice.  Sure.  And he'll go, we can't stop in Duluth because of this.  We got it.  Right.  But you know what?  But almost everything, 95% of what he gives you is accurate and right.  How about this?  I decided to go to Boston for your taping. 
[00:17:00]  I would say I decided at five minutes to six.  And the whole trip with an itinerary is on my email.  What time is it now?  It was 33.  Yeah, but I announced it about 15 minutes ago.  Yeah.  It took him 15 to 20 minutes to book a trip with Amtrak tickets and everything.  15 minutes.  Because he knows this shit.  And he got me a good price, too.  It's not like I'm paying through the nose.  Some guy is saying if we don't go in May, we're going to miss the ostrich races. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, no.  The ostriches.  That's why we were doing this.  In Branson, Missouri.  We could have went to Branson.  It's just like a silly fucking show thing that we always talk about.  We could have went to Yakov's theater.  We're sure we could have interviewed Yakov.  It probably would have been great to hang out with and have on the show and fuck around with.  Of course.  We do it at the end of September.  Just utter fucking incompetence.  And we were supposed to continue our city trips.  We did Cleveland.  We did Chicago. 
[00:18:00]  And then that's been a while now, right?  That's been about six months.  We were supposed to do a few more of those.  It's been more than that, wasn't it?  We were planning on trying to do one of those every other month.  It's the summer when we went to Chicago, right?  I don't even know.  I guess, right?  It was when Tyson was in here.  So I think it was like June.  No, it wasn't that long.  When did I see Mike Tyson?  It might have been June because last April we were in Cleveland, right?  For the taping?  Oh, it was August. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, okay.  So seven months ago.  September, October.  What?  Chicago was seven months ago?  Yeah, because six months until September.  So last August was seven months ago.  Yeah, you're right.  That was quite...  I mean, it's up to us.  I mean, we could sit here and just rot as a radio show or we have to fucking, you know,  figure this shit out and move on from this place because it's...  I mean, it's fun to laugh in their face.  It's fun to beat the shit out of them.  Make sure the world knows they're incompetent.  But also, you know, we're suffering in the end because there's so much more we want to 
[00:19:00]  do with this damn thing.  I'm lucky.  You know, there absolutely should be a visual element at this point.  It's never going to happen.  No, I know.  No, I know.  That's why now I just laugh.  You know, I used to yell and scream and sound like a lunatic because I really believed in  the place I was at and I was trying to wake some people up.  That's why I laugh.  That's why I just laugh at it now because I know how ridiculous it is and that nothing  will change.  He's lost the confidence of every single person that works for this channel. 
[00:19:30]  A lot of people can't be vocal about it because they're on a lower level and they could  get in some real trouble for vocalizing it.  But I'm telling you, Gary, you lost everyone's confidence.  Everyone's.  The wall ain't coming down.  The visual element ain't happening.  The show ain't traveling.  And there's no...  Bus trip.  The money...  Hey, look.  They pay.  I'm happy with the money I make here.  I'm happy to do...  I am.  The gig is fun, but I've looked at the...  The radio show to me was always, this was the big thing.  Right.  And this was my whole fucking... 
[00:20:00]  I love this thing.  Right.  And after a while of being here, it is literally still something that's very important to me.  Right.  It's still something I love doing, but it is not at all what I look like is going to  carry me.  Right.  It's a jumping off place and a home base to come back to.  Yeah, when this mic's on, I'll try like hell, but I'm not...  I don't believe in anything that this company says to me anymore.  Not a fucking thing.  You know, I mean, Scott Greenstein looked me right in the eye and said, all right, yeah,  we'll get that wall done for you.  No problem.  And he said at the time, look, I don't think we can give you the whole studio behind this 
[00:20:30]  wall, but we'll give you a nice piece.  I'm like, cool.  That's all we need.  We just needed a little piece.  And then they got, you know, they got back to us saying it's going to cost $400,000 to  $500,000 to remove the wall.  And now a mere week, maybe two weeks later, now the bus trip's being put off.  It's just zero good faith.  Zero.  Zero.  I told you, I knew we weren't doing a bus trip.  That's why I wasn't talking about it that much.  I wasn't making plans with my family. 
[00:21:00]  Like when you have two small kids, you can't just do willy-nilly shit anymore.  You got to kind of prepare.  But I told the wife, I'm like, look, it's not happening.  So we don't even need to discuss this.  How sad is that?  Knowing that it wasn't going to happen.  You just knew.  So, um, late September, huh?  Late September.  But something will-  Like the end of September.  When it's getting colder.  Yeah.  Like, why not do it in the fucking very beginning and just fucking go down to the south?  It'll be fun.  Branson will be fun. 
[00:21:30]  It's a silly, stupid little trip.  I would love to know what the issues were.  Because even, like I said, Steve Blatter looked at Gary in this meeting like, what?  What do you mean?  And he was trying to push it to June and Blatter's looking at him like, how complicated could this be?  Like, what is the issue?  Getting the actual buses?  Maybe he never looked into getting the buses.  The fact is-  The hotels are easy.  You call one hotel chain and go, look, we're going into four places.  We want to use your hotel chain.  They would probably set us up nice. 
[00:22:00]  That seems easy.  The broadcast is pretty damn easy.  And they don't have a good enough sales staff to get a sponsor for it.  Or a partial sponsor for it.  To go, look, this is what's going to happen.  We could do this here.  Giveaways here.  Whatever it is you do that gets a sponsor motivated to pay for stuff, their sales staff is hideous.  Right.  And can't get that done.  So they're looking at it like, why should we spend this money?  What's in it for us?  Because that's the problem when you have this basic subscription service as opposed to subs. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, as opposed to ratings, is you don't feel like you're going to go out and just grab new people.  You're only preaching to the choir, as they say.  So the people you're speaking to are already in the mix.  Right.  So there's no need to go out there and meet.  Who gives a fuck?  So there's the big headline today.  Another thing that's not happening.  Nope.  I just laughed at them yesterday, Sam. 
[00:23:00]  It's really funny when they had to tell you.  Because you know.  Because it's exactly, I know this shit.  I know way more about radio than those guys.  Way the fuck more.  It's not even close.  But I would have thought that they would try everything humanly possible to make sure that this happens just so they don't have to go to you.  Right.  And say, well, we're going to put it, and say everything that you said would happen.  Right.  I would love, because the guy doesn't like being on the radio, I would love for him to come on the radio and explain why the bus trip needs to wait another six months. 
[00:23:30]  Six months?  But in my mind, something else will happen.  So to even say it's happening in six months, that's hilarious, too.  Naive.  It's extremely naive, because there's so much that will change or happen between now and then.  Six months is just a good amount of time that it's like, okay, that fire will kind of go down, and we can shift the focus over here.  Yeah, then they'll slowly, what happens is then that'll slowly fade away as an idea, but something else will pop up, and then they'll go, well, instead of doing the bus tour, we're going to do this instead. 
[00:24:00]  And it's probably something that's a lot easier, that has something to do with the company.  I don't know.  We walk around the building with serious hats.  We're going to do the building walk around.  And so we start on 6th Avenue and 49th, and we do a complete circle to the left.  The lawyers would not okay us going back against traffic by foot in case somebody rubber-necked him was killed.  So we're going to do the one block around, the walk around with serious hats. 
[00:24:30]  We hope fans will come and wave at us.  Just shit.  We've gone as far as we can.  Shit.  You know, they've got to figure out a new business model for this place, or they're going to lose, you know, they're going to lose talented shows.  I think they've already lost talented shows.  Dude, podcasts.  Because no one's going to put up with this shit.  Podcasts are already more relevant.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, you hear.  They have more sponsors.  More sponsors.  Like, literally, Rogan on his podcast has a video element and sponsors because he's doing it himself.  He starts his show by talking about all his sponsors. 
[00:25:00]  When I was there, I was amazed listening to him do read after read for sponsors.  We have one.  We have Steven Singer and then a bunch of, you know, who gives a fucks that come along here and there.  Well, guys that will come and stay for three months and then move on and then come back.  You know, just guys that are kind of just in transit.  And I even told, I told the people to know here, I'm like, do you guys even listen to podcasts?  All you have to do is listen to Jay Moore, Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, Throwin' Voss and Bonnie and a few others.  You will hear a, Bob Kelly, excuse me, you'll hear a whole list of sponsors they got. 
[00:25:30]  So then what you should do as a sales staff is go and knock on their fucking doors because we're talking to way more people,  except for maybe Rogan at this point, but the rest of them, we're definitely still talking to way more people than them.  And those sponsors would gladly come aboard.  It's embarrassing.  It's unbelievable.  It's embarrassing.  Simply embarrassing.  Well, you know, their logic, I'll say it every fucking time this comes up, they decided we'll pay Howard a shitload of money 
[00:26:00]  and that'll carry the company and nothing else matters.  And we're in the nothing else matters category, as much as we tried for a few years to, you know, push out of that category.  But the fact remains, it doesn't matter.  As long as Howard's still here and they pay him all the fucking money, pretty much all the programming money,  pretty much all the marketing money, pretty much all the promotional money, nothing else matters.  It doesn't, it just doesn't matter. 
[00:26:30]  And then what they're going to do when Howard finally leaves, then they're going to scatter around trying to figure out what they do next,  which is the stupidest thing in the world.  It's dumb.  It's a really dumb way to run a company.  And you got a show like us that ours that we want to do more.  There's all these shows around here.  They don't give a fuck.  They'll sit and rot in their chairs.  They don't give a fuck.  We do.  And they can't even get the bus tour together.  Man, I hope my elevator show takes off because that's all I got. 
[00:27:00]  That's it?  That's all I got, man.  Since, uh...  That's all I fucking got.  What?  I was going to ask for another coffee, but then I remembered that Kenny's now left.  I got coffee?  No, well, you're drinking your coffee.  Yeah, you want to share mine?  No.  Times are tough.  Get a cup.  No, thanks.  I'll have a last.  Baby, Iraq, can you send something in the back just for coffee, please?  Flavored coffee with skim milk.  By the way, I patched together a drumming in the elevator show for tomorrow.  I had to patch it together.  That's exciting. 
[00:27:30]  We got in trouble, so I patched something together.  That was much better than I thought.  Sorry, Sam.  That was much better than I thought.  Yeah, but that'll be this week's elevator show, which is released every Thursday.  Oh, I thought they came out on Wednesday.  Every Thursday, man.  What was I thinking?  Like clockwork.  You got to get everyone on a schedule, and then you're guaranteed more clicks.  Yeah.  It's all about the clicks.  The numbers.  Well, when I check my numbers, I want to make sure people have done the right thing  and gave me a few clicks.  Right.  That's it.  That's all I'm looking for, a few clicks.  That's all you need. 
[00:28:00]  That's all I need.  Uh-oh.  And then somebody talked to me yesterday like, you know, this is exactly what's told to  me, and of course, I knew this was coming, too.  They go, you know, that elevator show's going to be a problem, but, you know, I'm just going  to let it go for now.  I'm going to let it go for now.  But it will be a problem.  Why would it be a problem?  Why would that be a problem?  I get if I did, like, you know, shows like the drumming episode week after week, that 
[00:28:30]  would be a problem.  But why would that dumb little concept, that stupid little idea be a problem?  Because it was your idea.  Hmm.  And then you just did it.  Hmm.  And no matter, it doesn't...  Everything's a problem in the end.  If you do something successfully, but it's your idea and you didn't include...  Because I don't want to include...  I got ideas.  I don't want to include them in anything.  Because they fuck up everything.  Then it'll be a problem.  One reason why I don't shoot as much video in studio is because they want to get their 
[00:29:00]  hands involved in that as well.  So I said, you know what?  Fuck them.  I'll take our guys that are very talented and I'll film shit outside the studio.  They wanted logos on everything and their name and the title and all sorts of shit.  There's no...  They want the pocket money that it earns.  Like, they had to get their stupid little grimy hands involved in that as well.  So I said to myself, you know what?  I'm only going to film every once in a while in the studio.  Fuck them.  I could put up a cool video from this studio every day. 
[00:29:30]  But I don't want anything to do with them as far as my business goes.  It's a big problem.  There's not a lot of bigger picture thinking.  Like, there's not...  It's new media.  Right.  So, like, if you get big on YouTube, regardless of what you film or where you film it, it's  better for the show.  It's better for the company.  It comes with being...  Sorry.  It comes with being territorial about content for no reason.  And unreasonably so and not seeing how things work.  You know, my YouTube channel is up to 41 million views.  That's a big deal. 
[00:30:00]  And as a company, they can't even...  They can't get anyone watching their videos when real stars come in.  And nobody's going to...  I'm filming mostly the street people and goofballs.  And my videos do way better than anything they pop up on that site.  And nobody's going to watch your videos and think to themselves, well, I can just watch  his videos.  Why subscribe to the service?  No.  Nobody.  Because it's always a twist or something.  Of course.  Listen, they're short videos.  You go, oh, I like him.  I'm going to subscribe to the service.  Don't get me wrong. 
[00:30:30]  They said, you know, they're allowing me to film in studio because I had that discussion.  They're allowing me.  But they want to be involved.  I'm like, you know what?  No.  You're not being involved in my shit anymore.  Because you fuck up everything.  Big fucking logos they want all over the fucking place.  So I'll put up a tiny little logo here and there.  There's logos all over the walls.  It's already there.  Well, that's why you think they're there.  I told them, look, I can't guarantee I'm going to fucking put a logo on in studio videos. 
[00:31:00]  So why don't you put some shit up on the wall so that if we film in here, you'll see where  it came from.  I just don't want them involved.  Put the logos up on the wall and just let it be.  Right.  It's just depressing.  But, you know, fuck it.  It's not really depressing.  I'm in a great mood.  I have a great week.  Yeah.  No, it's not really depressing.  The future's bright.  Yeah, but it depresses me, though.  Why?  I don't believe in this place.  It's not about the place.  It's just...  They're telling me that they could fucking fire me tomorrow.  I don't care. 
[00:31:30]  NAW, I cared a lot.  But, I mean, they would put me out of my misery if they had said, go home.  Dude, I'm 44.  And then I would take a little break.  I'd watch my kids grow up slightly.  And then I'll fucking, you know, redo the whole thing the right way.  I don't care.  I'm fucking 44.  This is not a dress rehearsal in my life or my career.  Like, this is the real thing.  Right.  You know, it's like sometimes we look at life like it's...  I mean, we, everyone.  It's a dress rehearsal.  Like, okay, I'm just going to be able to fuck around and do this and that.  And then I'll have a chant. 
[00:32:00]  And it's like, this never comes back.  No.  Never.  That's why guys don't pursue, like, real...  Like, I feel bad for guys to come up to me and they're, hey, man, I'm 40.  And I never did stand-up.  Or I never tried radio.  And I always wanted to.  And it's like, because, A, maybe circumstance didn't allow.  Right.  But a lot of times people look at things like it's a rehearsal.  Right.  No, this is it.  It's like it's not.  This is it.  It's hard to motivate until you think of it that way.  Like, man, if I don't do or at least try what I want to fucking try and move, I'm just  going to fucking get stuck here.  Right.  In anything you're doing in life, if you want to go out and just try something, just shut 
[00:32:30]  up and go out and fucking try it.  And if you fail, you're never going to look back and go, I should have given that a shot.  And I think we've been here in this building about four years.  And we were on the wrong side of the merger.  So the first year or two, you're like, OK, we got to wait.  These guys don't didn't you know that they don't know much about our show or believe in  it because they never really had to pay attention to it.  So we're going to have to fuck a deal for the first year or two.  Then like three years in, that's when, you know, we're like, all right, hello. 
[00:33:00]  What the fuck?  We're ready to take this to the next level.  Hello.  And now we're four years in.  And we're to the point where we absolutely don't believe, you know, that this company  can make this show better.  But we'll turn on the mics every day and we'll, you know, we'll certainly continue to put on  a good radio show.  I think the show in general, it's been really good lately, you know, but there's more we  want.  And this place isn't going to give it to us.  They don't have the money because they give it all to Howard and they don't have the right  people.  They don't have the right people around here.  I saw a lot of the talented people would start marching out of here. 
[00:33:30]  As soon as they had another opportunity, they got the fuck out of here because they weren't  being, you know, paid right or treated, treated well.  So bus trips off for six more months, you know, but we all know what that means.  Phones are lit.  We can't rely on them, man.  We can't rely on them.  I know, but unfortunately, they never have and they never will. 
[00:34:00]  We're under contract with them, so we have to kind of work with them.  You know, I mean, we could, we want a visual element when we can't really do it without  their blessing and they will not see it our way.  We should present them at least with an option.  Like, this is where Bob has to current.  You present them with an option and go, this is it.  Boom, boom, boom.  Like, I feel like Bob Kelly right now.  Boom, you got the video.  But hey, look, we have a potential for this right here.  Yes or no.  And we don't do that.  We should do that.  Force Bob to do it.  It's never going to happen.  Why don't you go to HR if you have such a problem with management? 
[00:34:30]  Let me tell you something, Alex, you stupid fuck.  You stupid fuck.  I'm not an HR guy.  I don't go to HR.  I've never gone to HR.  I don't even know where the HR office is.  I don't even know who the HR bitch is.  But that's not an HR issue, though.  I have no idea who runs the HR department here, and I have no desire to.  That's not an issue with human resources.  We're not saying management is harassing us.  They're not sexually harassing us.  Gary doesn't lick my neck when I walk by.  Maybe Alex goes to HR. 
[00:35:00]  He might have been asking a legit question.  Was he saying that in a bitchy way?  He might have been saying that in a real, like, hey, man, maybe you could try this.  Alex, sorry.  That's all right.  I don't care.  Are you an HR guy, though?  Do you go to HR?  No, it's just...  I think going to HR, I'll be honest with you, is such a pussy move.  No, it's just the fact that, like, I've had bosses where I've never really got anything done.  And the only time I've ever gone to the department is to get something done. 
[00:35:30]  Like, I'll give you an example.  So I'm looking for more hours on my night job, but the only time I can really get it is if I go to the head honcho or top dog or whatever.  And then I usually get something done.  No, we're usually on the radar of the top dogs and stuff.  But, you know, how this place is set up, they just don't have the resources is what it comes down to in the end. 
[00:36:00]  They just don't have it.  They decided, and it was their move.  It was their move to just give everything to Howard.  And then everyone else, like I said, is in the who-gives-the-fuck category.  The nothing-else-matters category.  That's exactly how this place runs.  I knew it when we got into it.  I hated the fact they were merging because I knew we'd have to fucking deal with the Howard bullshit again.  And what I mean by the Howard bullshit is what that means, you know, when you work for the same company as Howard, you get nothing. 
[00:36:30]  Because they give him everything.  And they think, you know, he's worth it.  And that's open for a fucking debate.  But I don't feel like having that right now.  But this goes even beyond him because this is not even, like a lot of times it's not even money.  A lot of times it's not, it's just literally sludge and lethargy.  Oh, it's money.  There's so many people around here that haven't had a fucking raise in a long time or a real raise, I should say.  I mean the lack of creative thinking where someone not going to Kenny and going, hey, we'd like you to take a look at this and see what you can come up. 
[00:37:00]  I'm saying that lack of forward thinking or that has nothing to do with money.  That's just lethargy and that's just, it's fog.  It's fucking fog.  It's the middle management syndrome, which we've talked about, too.  Middle management is fucking up companies left and right.  And HR departments.  Oh, God.  Do you know, I don't, I don't know who the HR person is.  I don't either.  I hope it's not a lady because they said, bitch, that could be a problem.  It is.  It'll be a problem?  No, no, no, it's a lady.  Oh, it is?  I don't know her. 
[00:37:30]  You want a woman, if you're a company, you want a woman in charge of human, you don't want a guy.  I don't want, I, I.  If you're a company, you got to have one.  So you want to have a woman in charge of human.  Yeah, who decided every company has to have an HR department?  Lawyers.  The same ones that have done it.  Of course.  Of course.  And I always said I'll never meet with an HR person.  I'd rather walk.  I'm not fucking dealing with that horse shit.  Ever.  That's why I just, when, when these mics are off and I walk these halls, I'm just polite to everyone.  I don't fucking get into any, fucking talk with anybody because I'm not going into an HR office for some nonsense. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, we joined the Indie Channel?  Yep.  Officially.  So what does that mean?  Sundays.  Okay, that's good.  11 a.m.  We could end this with some positive news.  11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern.  On Sundays?  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Indie.  They told me that's a big listening time.  Sundays, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Fuck yeah, man.  8 a.m.  I mean, that's, because that's when you want drive time in L.A. on a Sunday.  Well, no, I mean, they don't really acknowledge the rest of the country. 
[00:38:30]  This is an East Coast company.  Because I've argued that point with them as well.  Like, you do know that this fucking service goes all the way to the, you know, the West Coast.  There's a lot more cars in California than there are here in this.  Like, people drive more in California than in Manhattan.  That's why I wanted to cheat the start time of the show, because then you get a little more live radio for the West Coast.  So, that means we'll be on in L.A. 8 to 11 a.m.?  8 to 10.  Oh, it's only two hours.  8 to 10. 
[00:39:00]  And then it's 11 to 1 here on the East Coast.  Yeah.  On a Sunday.  Yeah.  On every Sunday.  Well, that's kind of exciting.  Yeah.  Why are they shoving us in on the weekend?  They don't have a full channel yet, do they?  Yeah, well, I mean, they got their dates parts.  They got Pete Dominick, Cavino, and Rich and Jay Thomas every day.  All right, squeeze us in somewhere else then.  Squeeze us in between some of these date parts. 
[00:39:30]  And then they got their weekly shows, you know.  They got, like, Rotten Tomatoes two days a week.  Yawn.  Some guy named Dan Dunn one day a week.  Yawn.  The author, Neil Strauss, does a show one day a week.  Nice guy.  I like Neil.  He's good.  I don't know if he could do radio, though.  I have no idea.  I have no idea where they get these guys that have never done radio before.  All right.  Cool.  Me neither.  We'll see how that works.  Just in time for football.  A few months out from football, and we're going to be on Sundays. 
[00:40:00]  That's great.  I try to tell him that.  I try to tell him that.  You don't want to be before football ever.  That's a dead spot for...  We talk to the same people.  The people we talk to, they all have a football team.  And they're all into fantasy football.  So this indie move will be good for a couple months, and then when we get closer to football,  it's going to be a dead...  It'll be a dead zone for our show.  Channel 104 on Sirius and XM.  Oh, they figured that out at least. 
[00:40:30]  Uh-huh.  That's good.  So indie's on both services as the same channel.  That's good.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  What channels are we on?  206, 105, right?  Correct.  Finally got that right.  Which is which?  206 is Sirius.  Very good.  I literally have no idea what channels we're on.  Until you just said that.  If you said we're on channel 150 and 802, I would...  Because it's too complicated.  Yeah.  You know, that's where I would start if I, you know, was a bigwig in this country. 
[00:41:00]  We got to get...  We got to put the...  We got to put the...  We got to make the channels the same on each as much as we can.  How are they going to find us?  Like, people are casual listeners.  Most of our audiences, you know, we got the hardcores that listen to every word, and then  they got to fucking decipher it, and then they have to throw their hate at us and all  that.  But the fact is, you know, most of these people are casual listeners.  They don't want to have to try to figure out, like, you know, what channel we are on on 
[00:41:30]  each service.  They want it as easy as possible.  That's what you learn in radio when you first start with this horseshit.  Kind of make it as easy as possible for the listeners.  No thinking involved.  That's why contesting went from, you know, some dumb trivia question and all that to,  no, man, just fucking seventh caller, tenth caller, make it easy.  Boom.  They just want to call.  They don't want to play games.  And you'll get the phones lit for a contest.  I don't think marriage is being talked about. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, we can talk about that next.  We'll move on.  I mean, it's a biggie today with the bus trip being postponed.  Postponed to the end of September.  What did they tell you in the meeting?  Because, you know, we don't even go to those meetings anymore.  No.  Well, I mean, I don't know if you ever did, but...  Not really.  Just that they thought it would be...  They and promotions and everybody thought in terms of putting it together the right way  that it would be better to postpone it, and now we're looking at the end of September. 
[00:42:30]  But why couldn't they put it together the right way for mid-May?  That's the question I have for those dopes.  And I'll tell you why, because they didn't even think about it.  They just had it on their desk somewhere as one of many things they have to do,  and they just pushed it off.  They pushed it off to the point they don't have enough time to get it done.  This has been talked about for close to a year, if not over a year.  And Blatter told me, no way.  I'm like, I'm telling you.  It started with Greenstein as a casual idea.  That had to be a year ago. 
[00:43:00]  Had to be.  We didn't ask any follow-up questions.  There was just a lot of kind of snickering.  Right at him, right?  I mean, snickering.  Not guffawing, but, you know, some snickers.  And then Troy making blatantly disrespectful comments.  Well, good for him.  Which drew more snickering, of course.  Well, good for him.  Yeah.  He's very funny.  He's one of the many guys extremely underpaid,  so he has every right to laugh at him a little bit.  All right, we're going to take a little break here.  I think Ant's on his way in. 
[00:43:30]  Do we have an update on him?  I think he said 7 o'clock, so we'll break.  We'll get some coffee.  We'll get some food.  And we're going to talk about gay marriage and a bunch of other things.  Stay there.  This is the O.B. and Anthony channel.  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  Thanks for calling the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line. 
[00:44:00]  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, here's a big F.U. to my fucking drone.  Spent $3,000 on it, crashed it twice, spent another $3,000 fixing it.  Fuck you, drone!  Fuck you!  Hey, just heard one of your bozo callers complain about the ecstasy of gold playing during the intro?  It's too long?  What the fuck are you talking about?  It's the most epic intro to the most epic radio show ever! 
[00:44:30]  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Hey, this is a fuck you to Jimmy Norton.  I recently watched you on Red Eye.  Fuck, you look fabulous.  Growing a bit of hair, wearing black chiseled chin.  Fuck, you look fabulous.  Fuck you!  I don't give a fuck, I'll sing all day.  I don't give a fuck, I love singing anyway.  I don't give a fuck about you.  Fuck you!  Fuck you! 
[00:45:00]  Fuck you very much for ruining another goddamn song.  Every time I hear the show opener clear the lane, it gets to the drum drop and don't I hear in my fucking head,  B-B-B-B-Big Jelly Titch!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This FU goes out to one-ply toilet paper.  Really?  You make me divergenize my ass with my own finger because you're so cheap you can't even handle a somewhat sloppy shit.  I'm gonna wipe my ass with my finger and it almost goes halfway up my butt.  Now I'm okay with them and ain't allergic anymore. 
[00:45:30]  I'm not fucking gay.  Fuck you, one-ply toilet paper.  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony SU line.  866-SU-LINE-1.  That's 866-SU-LINE-1.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up!  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man, settle down.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going to go to fun and land.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going? 
[00:46:00]  What a termite's eat for breakfast.  Oh, what a million.  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the look-alike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck that.  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town. 
[00:46:30]  All right, what's Mary's short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:00]  Well, I don't know why I came here tonight.  I got the feeling there's something right.  I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair.  And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.  Bump, bump, bump.  Clowns to the left of me.  Joke to the right!  Stuck in the middle with juice.  Oh.  Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you.  Oh, right, remember that?  Remember that?  Was that a parody?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quentin Tarantino, the big 5-0 today. 
[00:47:30]  Congratulations, making it a 50.  You sweaty mess.  I don't know, or don't know, I'm going to torture you anyway.  Reservoir dogs.  Holy shit.  Can we make it Quentin Tarantino day?  He digs some...  Oh.  He's got some great songs.  Now, E-Rock throws his fucking...  No, no, I'm fine with that.  Do you understand what that means?  Ant said it.  Yeah.  He's got a lot of great music in his movies.  Yeah, exactly.  Memorable...  Get some of that surfer shit.  Memorable scenes.  Right. 
[00:48:00]  You remember just from the songs.  You hear them now.  It's easy to do a band day.  Let's do a Quentin Tarantino day and see what you come up with, all right?  Okay.  First 50th birthday.  We're all big fans of Quentin.  Anthony has made it into the studio and...  Holy shit.  You wrote me and said, wow, this is a really good listen.  Yeah, yeah.  I gotta tell you something.  I'm driving in.  Yeah.  And sometimes, you know, we think we got it pretty bad here.  Right.  With our show.  Right.  But I was listening to a show that I couldn't fucking imagine being part of. 
[00:48:30]  It seems other people are doing shows where the bosses don't give a shit what happens on it.  There was some show I was listening to.  Apparently, they were supposed to go on a bus trip.  Yeah.  And it's not happening.  It's not happening.  For six months.  And I'm listening to these radio personalities talking, going, I would hate to be part of  that show.  No, but Anthony, you are part of the show.  Oh!  Literal Jimmy.  Literal Jimmy.  Do you want to add to it? 
[00:49:00]  You were here.  I was here indeed.  For the big announcement.  When they came in and told us...  Well, we were trying to march out like we usually do.  Of course.  And they go, oh, we need to talk to you for a couple of minutes, like a couple of minutes.  I was wondering why they both came in studio.  I knew.  Yeah.  I knew, too.  As soon as I saw both those knuckleheads...  You knew there was a problem.  I knew.  Knuckleheads.  I was hoping E-Rock was going to pull the clip when I said this wasn't happening.  I said it weeks ago.  I didn't even plan for it. 
[00:49:30]  Not at all.  Like I said, the wife was like, hey, if you go away for a week, we've got to figure out  some shit.  I'm like, yeah, but I'm not going away for a week, so I'm not going to worry about it.  There's enough to worry about at home.  When the bosses, or whatever they are, come in and announce some disappointing news about  something you want to do, the reaction should not be the entire air staff laughing.  And that's exactly what happened.  We all just went, ha, ha, ha, and started laughing.  Right.  And the only reason that happens is if you've been kicked numerous times. 
[00:50:00]  I don't even know if we get kicked anymore.  I mean, figuratively speaking.  We know what we got.  When these mics go on, we'll fucking entertain the people to the best of our abilities, but  that's all I can promise anyone.  And, of course, our friend Vinny was in here yesterday.  He sat in for a little bit of the show, and he actually, we were talking on the way  out, and he said, he goes, I really thought you were playing a joke on me, like, because 
[00:50:30]  I've heard you talk about stuff like this all the time.  Right.  How the bosses just drop the ball on everything.  On everything.  He goes, I honestly thought, and he was serious, that you would plan this to, like, punk me,  or play a joke on me.  Like, the guys that he's heard about, perfectly described, came in.  He thought we were exaggerating.  Yeah.  And he goes, and they started saying stuff about the bus trip, and it wasn't happening.  He goes, I was sitting there going, is this like a joke they're playing on me?  Because, like, it's a caricature of the show and what they've talked about. 
[00:51:00]  And, no, I was like, no.  That really happened.  What a self-centered ass Vinny is.  I know, that's what I'm getting out of that.  People are going to get together and fucking put on a four-act play for you?  Exactly.  I think that's what I got out of that.  What, do you think this is the Truman Show, you fucking self-involved bull?  Holy fuck.  How is it possible to hang out with a guy like that?  I don't know.  I mean, your ego is pretty fucking strong.  And then you've got another guy that believes the whole world revolves around him. 
[00:51:30]  I think it was more that it was so ridiculous that it couldn't be real.  His point being, he was privy to see what we see on a regular basis.  And he couldn't believe it.  He thought, maybe we exaggerate for the radio show.  Gotcha.  But there they were, walking in and saying, and I was listening on the way.  And, obviously, you, it was exactly.  Obviously, I'm a great broadcaster.  Oh, yes, I heard that.  Okay, good, good, good.  You hear me peppering in from the side? 
[00:52:00]  I heard the peppering.  It was great.  And, obviously, when we split up, I'll have no problem doing this myself.  Oh, please.  And you'll do well as well.  Maybe we'll get together for some reunion shows.  It's going to be fantastic.  Besides that, what else did you hear?  You were saying something that was exactly what I was thinking.  September, whenever they want to do this.  On and on!  Whenever they want to do this.  I was thinking, there's no way they're now going to put all their effort into working on this until September. 
[00:52:30]  What they do now is out of sight, out of mind.  They shove this off somewhere and don't even think about it until, again, the last minute.  And what they're hoping for?  Yeah.  This is how this shit works?  Now they're saying late September, by the way.  They said late summer.  And I'm like, well, you know, I want to keep my summer free.  So, no problem.  First week in September.  I was stupid to even say that because I'm like, what are you doing?  This ain't happening.  No.  So, now it's six months from now.  So, now they got six months hoping that something happened. 
[00:53:00]  And then they'll attach themselves to that and go, well, we're going to do this instead of the bus trip.  Yeah.  They'll honestly start talking about, like, the Super Bowl, I bet.  Something.  They're going to start talking in September like, well, it's in Jersey.  You guys want to go?  And hopefully we forget.  We'd rather, like, put all our effort and money into the Super Bowl instead of the bus trip.  Are you guys cool with that?  To ramp up to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah, ramp up.  Maybe we could do a bus trip to Jersey.  Yeah.  To the Metal Land. 
[00:53:30]  Even that they couldn't pull off.  No!  Well, the lawyers don't want to insure you in case, you know, I'm fucking shocked.  Can you indemnify?  Why don't we indemnify?  Yeah, exactly.  So, that word is fun, fun, fun written all over it.  All right, so if somebody trips in the lobby and sues you, I'm responsible.  Good.  But they'll tell us, no, it's happening.  All right, well.  Yeah.  Well, all right, great.  It was supposed to happen in, you know it was supposed to happen in April.  Of course.  Then they moved it to May.  And then they were trying for June.  And then they're trying to tell me that this hasn't been on the books for almost a year. 
[00:54:00]  I think it's over a year.  Over a year.  Over a year.  I remember, because we haven't sat in Greenstein's office in quite a long time.  And I know we used to have discussions in there, like, you know, we want to throw you on a bus.  Well, now they can coast.  They could just coast now.  They're like, ah, we got the summer.  We don't have to think about anything to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's fascinating.  It's amazing.  Whatever.  Yeah.  The wall.  The fuck?  It's just everything.  It's just everything.  It's just one pile of shit.  Yeah.  Lie after a year. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think it's a lie.  You know.  I'm not going to say lie.  It's one thing they say.  Every time they talk, they act like an eight-year-old with a broken lamp next to them.  And they will say anything to not be punished in that moment.  I think they have good intentions, but they just can't figure out shit.  When Shane Smith was talking about shit beach, man, I'm sitting here going, we know a thing  or two about shit beach.  Yeah.  We're on shit beach every day.  We're shit on pretty much every day from this place. 
[00:55:00]  And what's frustrating, we do our jobs.  Yeah.  Usually it was a give and take.  Like, back in the day of the golden years of radio, man, if you did a fucking show like  we did, then they come to the table and they give you everything.  Oh, amazing.  They do their part.  Yeah.  Nice fart.  That was a good fart.  Oh, by the way.  I didn't talk to it.  By the way, I don't know if he tweeted, but he emailed me.  Moses Gates admitted that that was his fart the other day.  Oh, it was.  We all thought it was. 
[00:55:30]  First of all, that was two farts, because I didn't mention the first one.  It was so bad.  Yeah, he admitted to it in an email.  He said he had a really good time, and then he goes, all right, I got to confess.  That was me.  Yeah.  It was horrid.  It was horrendous, right?  Holy shit.  Rival Jimmy's.  Yeah.  I mean, we've been smelling Jimmy's farts for a while.  It's kind of like, it's almost like potpourri at this point.  Yeah.  It doesn't bother me.  But man, when you smell a foreign, foreign fart, there's nothing worse. 
[00:56:00]  And it was the second one of his interview.  Yeah.  The first one, I let it go.  But then that one, and it was almost wrapping up.  He just had to pinch his fucking cheats together for another couple of minutes.  And that was it.  And he let loose.  So, no bus trip anytime soon.  People were getting excited out there, too.  Oh, by the way, I also booked a trip to Boston.  I'm not going to be here Friday.  Yeah?  And it took five minutes.  Oh, really?  Five minutes. 
[00:56:30]  Through Kenny.  Kenny, what time did I say I want to go to Boston?  5.55, I think?  To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.  And I had an itinerary email at 6.15.  They weren't asking you to book the bus trip?  Negative.  I was an afterthought, I believe.  Well, that was after I bitched and said,  why aren't you going to the one guy around here that knows about buses and touring with them?  Right. 
[00:57:00]  For the people that don't know,  Kenny worked with Andrew Dice Clay for a while.  And a lot of that time was spent on a fucking bus.  Yes.  Yeah, that's too perfect.  Why would they use Kenny, the expert?  I brought to their attention the Department of Transportation's rules and regulations.  About how long a driver can drive legally.  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't even know that.  Why don't we just take it all the way to Austin in one trip?  One leg.  Mm-hmm.  So, enough about the bus, I guess. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We said what we had to say this time.  Another hour wasted talking about these dummies, these fucking idiots.  I'd be more than happy to do whatever needs to be done.  I know you would, Kenny.  Of course you would, Kenny.  Remember the good old days in XM?  They used to send us on like two, three trips a year.  And they go, Kenny, we're going to send them to a celebrity poker tournament.  Right.  In L.A.  Come back to me.  In L.A.  Yeah.  I would research it, do a budget.  Hey, we're doing CES in Vegas. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, let's go to Vegas.  Don't meet them back then, though.  They never had talent at CES.  Remember, they never sent guys to CES.  They've never been good with this.  All right.  Can we get Corporate Denny in here?  Maybe he would have a nice spin on this to get us all positive again.  Explain as he's walking down the hall everything that's going on, Sam.  And he'll have something to say about it, I'm sure.  Yes, Kenny.  Mardi Gras.  We want to.  Mardi Gras.  Remember those?  Mardi Gras.  Remember those?  More than once.  Yeah, Florida.  I guess that would be how to say that.  Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Well, then we started that initiative where we wanted to hit a bunch of cities.  And we did good for a while there.  We did Cleveland, Chicago.  And then we learned today, Chicago was already seven months ago.  Seven months.  That was seven months ago.  Well, you had an offer to go to Boston.  No, we didn't.  I suggested it to them, and it never got past the suggestion.  No, we had an offer to go to Boston.  No, you did have an offer.  Remember my email?  No, not from here.  No.  Oh, not from here.  No, but from a venue in Boston.  Yeah, and I suggested it.  I'm like, that could be an easy thing to do as well. 
[00:59:00]  But the whole, well, if we're doing the bus trip, blah, blah, blah.  But this is why they stink so badly.  Because Epics, before the shoot, does a lot of interviews with fans.  I'm doing an interview with Epics the day of, Friday.  They're going to be there filming simply because they want to get pre-show stuff.  And this dumb fucking company, it's like they would put you on television for nothing. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  Just interviewing the fans and the guys.  We would have been up there and a big part of it.  They never see that.  It's such shit.  Whatever money you would have spent on the broadcast, you would get back in the promotions on Epics.  Of course.  And Epics, they're talking to the same demos we certainly want to reach.  Yeah.  I didn't know you were doing this with Epics.  Every time I shoot, they're going to do something.  Very cool, man.  Danny, have you been listening to our woes?  Yes.  Yes.  You've had a couple of things, a couple of gripes with management.  A couple of gripes?  A couple of gripes. 
[01:00:00]  Everyone knocks head with management.  Are you used to listening to a radio show that has a couple of gripes?  It's interesting.  It's been good times and great oldies all day and all night.  What?  Were you...  A different spin.  Did you work for radio shows that had gripes with management?  And did they bring it to the attention of the listener?  That's probably a big no-no.  That is a no-no.  Did Harry Harrison say, what a bunch of assholes we work for?  No.  He would never say that as he's ramping up the Shirelles.  Just a different world. 
[01:00:30]  I work with a bunch of assholes.  This one from 1965.  As I work for a bunch of shitheads.  My boss is a cunt.  Here's the Beatles from 1965.  So the bus trip is September.  No.  That's great.  You've got all spring and all summer to promote it.  Right.  It's all about promotion.  It's good when you're three seasons away.  That's what you want to do.  Promotion three fucking seasons. 
[01:01:00]  Freak seasons.  Didn't we just kind of leave fall?  Do you understand?  I don't own the clothes yet that I'm going to wear on the bus trip.  No store sells the clothes I will need for the bus trip.  My daughter was basically just born and she'll be celebrating her first birthday.  Before we go on the bus trip.  Oh, God.  This will be easier for your wife because the kids will be at school.  Sure.  I love the positive spin.  They're making it easier for us all. 
[01:01:30]  You're trying to say that it's not good to bitch about the company or the radio station  you work for.  Makes good radio.  It does, right?  Yeah.  You kind of wish that Dan Ingram did a little of this, right?  He did, but in a different way.  How would he do it on air?  He would make fun of management.  You know, he would actually turn it on to somebody else on the show.  Boy, I was talking to so-and-so and he said that management is doing it this way so  you don't put the blame on yourself.  Ah, good one.  You know, like, I wouldn't say this about Dionne Warwick, but she hasn't had a hit since 
[01:02:00]  she had the Psychic Friends TV show.  I wouldn't say that.  Yeah, what happened to her?  Dionne Warwick.  What happened to her?  She, uh, her lawyer said she had a bad business manager.  She's pretty much on the front page of the paper today.  Dionne Warwick is broke.  Business managers should be lined up and mouthfucked.  Where'd she live in Jersey?  I thought she was living in Brazil.  She was a big fan of Brazil.  Maybe she is in Jersey.  I thought the paper said, uh, they knocked on her door in Jersey.  She owes, like, $10 million.  She was up here a couple of months ago.  She has $25,000 in assets. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  According to this article I'm looking at online right now, $25,000.  Most people have more money than Dionne Warwick.  Poor Dionne.  But it happens to a lot of artists.  It happened to, right?  It didn't happen to Billy Joel in his career, too.  Well, he trusted his brother-in-law.  And Springsteen, I think, had some problems, too.  Walk on by.  All gone.  Ever since she did the Psychic Friends TV show.  No hits.  You would think that money was still rolling in.  Oh, yeah.  Or she should have saw it coming.  The Psychic should have given her a heads up. 
[01:03:00]  Let her know.  That's sort of what I said, Denny.  Oh, wow.  How do you owe?  How do you owe $10 million and only have $25,000?  That's, uh...  Wow!  That's bad right there.  That's like the girl who downloaded all the illegal music, and now she just said, I can't pay.  Uh-oh.  So what do you do?  I can't pay.  You go to jail, maybe.  For downloading music.  Who does Deanna owe $10 million to?  IRS?  I would assume the IRS and maybe some mortgages and shit. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  After all the joy she's given us over the years, can't they just cut her some slack?  Yeah, you'd think so.  Come on.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  Yeah, they would just let this walk on by.  Walk on by.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  Right?  If you see me.  Now she's got a hitchhike to San Jose.  And you celebrate her whole catalog.  Oh.  We don't celebrate Deanna Warwick. 
[01:04:00]  Just start talking to the IRS.  Hey, how about you just walk on by?  Walk on by, don't.  Nothing to see here.  You know, I was talking to Sam in the kitchen a little while ago.  A little water talk?  A little water talk?  A little coffee.  A little coffee talk.  Yeah.  And I suggested that you guys get a mascot for the show.  A mascot.  A mascot.  So when you go out on location, you go out on the bus tour.  What's the shittiest animal?  Because that's the one we'll pick for our mascot.  You see, you get the listeners involved, or you have the listeners. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, really?  Do you not know we have a mascot?  Oh.  You haven't met the virus?  Oh, that's right.  We do have a mascot.  I even forgot about that.  Well, I thought we know.  That's now known as the Opinion Anthony Channel.  No, no, no.  The virus is our mascot.  We should bring Nick DiPaolo in here.  So, any advice, Danny?  We spent an hour bitching about this place.  Is that good, Ben?  I think what you do is you write everything down.  You write all your complaints down, and you give them a timetable.  Say, look, we'd like to hit this mark by maybe June.  And then how far are we along on the bus trip by July? 
[01:05:00]  So you get an itinerary.  Keep them on their toes, too.  So this is a good thing that they fucked up another thing.  Well, I think you put it out in the open, and you're able to air out your gripes,  and you have a microphone, and I think you might have the folks in the front office worried.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  They're really worried.  No, they don't care.  As long as Howard's still here, they don't care.  Oh, yeah.  It'll be a problem when he leaves.  Then they'll scramble around and try to figure out what's next for the company.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, but at least it's Wednesday, halfway to the weekend.  Humpday.  I like your clipboard there, too.  You got your clipboard with you all ready to go?  All ready to go.  Your pants are hiked up a little high today?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They're ready to go.  I've been losing some weight, so the pants can be blown down.  Uh-oh.  Thank you very much.  Nick.  Come on in, Nick.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Let me step aside and make room for Nick.  You probably should do that.  You probably should do that.  That's what you call it.  Let's take you and your dockers and get the fuck out of here.  Nick, he's an old-school radio guy. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Old-school.  Wait, you used to work with him?  Yeah.  Where?  We did a thing up in Albany.  Oh, wow.  No.  No.  It'll look the same after a while.  When I...  For real?  What was it for?  When I was auditioning for DirecTV or whatever the fuck.  Wait, you worked in Albany?  How did that turn out?  I think we did.  We worked across the street.  All right.  All right.  Look at you.  Did it not turn out good?  Huh?  Did it not turn out good?  No, it was good.  I got the job.  You know.  Kenny's worked with everybody.  What else you want to talk about? 
[01:06:30]  Now, let me understand.  It's right.  The bus trip is happening in two weeks.  And when you get back, they're going to knock down the squall the day after?  Yeah, it's perfect.  Nick knows.  I was driving here.  I was laughing at my fucking ball.  You know, right?  You know this shit now.  Nick's been in the business, so he's been through this shit before.  Well, if they were competent, as a manager, you guys have been fired just for the complaining.  No kidding.  I thought of that.  I thought of that before.  You're so right.  I was belly laughing on the way in there going, holy shit, God, is that a great angle.  If they were competent.  If they were competent, they would kick our asses out of here. 
[01:07:00]  So, yeah, there is an other side of this, which is nice.  We can do whatever the fuck we want.  We should acknowledge that.  I'm not worried about anything.  Anything they can say to me.  Not a thing.  Boy, is that Amanda Knox?  Pretty hot.  She is smoking.  I don't care who she killed.  Cute little murderer, right?  Cute little murderer.  Oh, God.  The murderer next door face she's got.  Is she going back to Italy?  I'd go back and face trial.  No, she's not.  Because of the laws over here, they can't send her back.  But if she leaves this country, let's say she goes to France to vacate and they can grab 
[01:07:30]  her or whatever country agrees to the extradition.  Yes.  So she can't even go anywhere.  Well, we were saying yesterday, imagine she gets on a plane to somewhere that's not even  close to Italy, but they have an engine problem and they say they're landing in Italy.  Ladies and gentlemen, due to mechanical difficulties, we'll be landing in Florence.  And she's just like, no, no, would they be able?  I mean, I guess they could if they wanted to, but I wonder what the law would allow them  to come on and take her.  They could do anything they want. 
[01:08:00]  If you're on their soil, they're coming to get you.  You are under arrest, though.  Where is she now?  Seattle.  I think she's a Seattle girl.  She's not leaving America.  They're not going to extradite her, especially since we have double jeopardy here in the United  States.  Apparently, they don't have it there.  She was exonerated.  She was found innocent, not guilty in Italy, and then they can appeal an innocent verdict.  Well, wasn't she, originally she was found innocent?  Didn't she get convicted? 
[01:08:30]  Then they appealed and she got acquitted?  He's right.  She was found guilty, then it was overturned.  Then it was overturned.  And now they're turning her back.  You know, he's saying, fuck it, get her back here.  Yeah, you're allowed to appeal a guilty verdict here in the States, but once you're found  innocent, that's it.  You know, you're innocent.  There, they can appeal an innocent verdict.  Wow.  So that's what they did, and they're going to retry her in absentia, but I don't think  she's gone back.  No fun.  No, why would she?  So they find her guilty, then what happens?  Then if she's anywhere in the world that has an extradition agreement, she's got to 
[01:09:00]  study up on where the fuck she could go.  Yeah.  She could pretty much go to like...  Seattle and Portland.  That's about it.  That's it.  She's actually going to enter the courtroom as they're doing the verdict, like Dwayne  Fredo entered the room.  Good old Portland.  I love it.  Portland allows a thing or two, huh?  They got some people hiding out there.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Pacific Northwest.  Sure.  A lot of woods.  She's fucking hot, though.  Yeah.  I want to go to Portland.  I think she did it. 
[01:09:30]  Based on what I've heard about...  Really?  I didn't think so.  I don't know.  I think her scumbag boyfriend did it.  But she definitely had something to do with it.  Oh, absolutely.  She's a twat.  She had knowledge of it.  Oh.  Because it seems like it was just a bunch of procedural shit that she got off with.  Wasn't there a fucking...  Like, there was no...  Wasn't there like somebody else was in the house and she wasn't there?  Nah, I think she was there.  And from what they say, she was there.  Casey Anthony was there.  Casey Anthony was there.  Chicks with nice tits and murdering instincts.  They used the baby to beat the guy over the head with. 
[01:10:00]  There was a...  Was there a baby there?  I don't know.  Yeah, Kaylee.  They swung her in a fucking pillowcase.  Like bad boys with fucking soda cans.  This guy's really mad we have the Amanda Knox story all wrong.  Yeah, maybe.  What is wrong?  Bill Knox.  Get on the phone.  Yeah, let's go to Brad in Mississippi.  Brad.  Brad, let's go.  Let's go.  No good mornings.  Hi, Brad.  Welcome aboard.  Y'all have fucked this up as a soup sandwich.  This is the problem.  Amanda was found guilty. 
[01:10:30]  She served four years in prison.  That's right.  She appealed and she was overturned and she was freed.  And then the courts went back and, like you said, they sent her to the Supreme Court and  they found her.  They didn't find her guilty.  They just said that the lower courts had to retry it.  Okay, so she did four years.  I guess we did get it wrong.  She never was exonerated.  Oh, you almost said that, right?  Oh, sweet.  She was never found innocent.  Of course, it's off the fucking Brian Williams.  Yeah, right.  And in the meantime, they found somebody else and they convicted that guy. 
[01:11:00]  He was an African and they convicted him of the murder.  Oh, that's racist.  That's how it is.  All right.  Well, thank you.  I hate to be corrected by somebody from Mississippi.  I know.  And Nick DiPaolo, you know, I'm a big fan of Brian Williams.  I think I love his dry humor.  Oh, really?  You like that?  Yeah.  When he goes on those talk shows, like, he's a news guy.  How can he be funny?  It's amazing, that dry humor of his.  He's the perfect straight man for Letterman.  I laugh and laugh.  Reminds me when Cronkhead used to be on laughing. 
[01:11:30]  It's exactly the same.  It's hard to have dry humor when you're carrying water for Obama.  Exactly.  Not a bad line.  No.  Definitely not.  Holy shit.  Two apples on a plate, Jimmy.  Yes, they always call me.  I'm like fucking Kevin Spacey in Swimming with Sharks.  You bring me a sweet and low and an equal, and I like one.  And two apples.  And you got the red and the green.  Yeah.  You can't decide.  Yeah.  Two apples.  No waiting.  Lost a lot of weight this game.  Yeah, we're wondering.  No.  We're wondering.  One too many green wars. 
[01:12:00]  I don't want to be alarmed about, guys.  You enjoy.  I'll have my apple.  As long as his weight stabilizes, we'll be all right.  We're just wandering a little bit.  A little bit.  I'm doing a play.  It's called The Machinist on George Street.  Nick, how you been, brother?  What can you say?  Can you say anything yet?  Not yet, but you'll be the first to know.  Where am I going to go with this information?  All right.  You guys seem to know more about it.  No, I don't know shit.  I was driving and going, are they talking about me?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  We can speculate based on our huge knowledge of radio.  I only thought of shit like what you guys are talking about.  I only thought that about my bosses.  I can't believe you guys are still here.  I know, right?  Nick's been in radio enough that he understands.  I got to tell you.  I was in it for three minutes and I got to taste.  But isn't radio just a fucked up business?  You've been around enough to understand this shit?  They make everything so complicated.  Well, like Jimmy said, podcasts are more relevant now, right? 
[01:13:00]  Right, right, right.  Not that there's a shitload of money in it, unless you're Rogan or Adam Carolla.  I think I'm going to do podcast.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I got like 50 hits on YouTube, so I think I took the temperature of the country.  You're ready.  I'm going to fucking run with that.  Put your foot in the water.  Oh, how was Vinny's, by the way?  That was the last time we talked to you.  It's good.  It's good.  After 25 years, you're going to be telling jokes next to Pete's oven.  It was great, Ope.  Thanks.  I guess what I meant.  It's actually good, though, because, I mean, they turned it into an actual, it's like 
[01:13:30]  a comedy club now, instead of like a fucking restaurant.  And, you know, when you work a new shit out, you can do like an hour and a half.  I guess what I meant was, how's the area?  Down there?  A couple people came in with seaweed in their hair and fucking lobsters.  This house is floating in the water?  Still?  Yes.  What's his name?  Dino was telling me.  There's still houses floating in the water.  And people take boats out to the house and loot them.  Holy shit.  Really?  Of course they do.  People are taking boats out and fucking looting the houses that are floating in the water. 
[01:14:00]  Wow, man.  How many fucking, what's there to loot anymore?  What can you possibly tell?  Somebody left some milk in the fridge.  I don't know.  That's a good point.  Fucking Heineken's.  Now they're just a giant poster.  They're just ripping the copper pipes out at this point.  Oh, yeah.  But I would imagine the guys that got there early got a few things.  Sure.  A few good things.  Springsteen CDs.  Soaked.  Signed Bon Jovi posters. 
[01:14:30]  Fucking shirts.  All curled up with salt on it.  It's going to be a drag for everyone enjoying their summers.  Yeah.  Seeing fucking houses in the water still.  So it's going to be a buzz kill.  Yeah.  That really did fuck things up, man.  I mean, you know, everybody just looked and went, ah, another storm.  We've seen these before.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  They had that one right on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  We were going to talk about gay marriage, I guess.  Gay marriage.  Yeah.  A lot of people on the Twitter. 
[01:15:00]  We got the Supreme Court figuring this shit out, right?  We're trying to.  Leave it up to the fucking states.  Jesus Christ.  A lot of people supporting it on Twitter.  It's called federalism.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Supreme Court won't do anything.  The Supreme Court is going to dismiss the case, which will help California.  Right.  Proposition 8 to be kind of fucking just, ah.  Don't let the states figure it out.  Just let the states figure it out.  Yeah.  It's more the will of the people.  Let the fucking Supreme Court.  What the fuck is going on in this country?  A lot of people say that you shouldn't have a popular vote on things that are just your  constitutional right and your human right shouldn't be voted upon. 
[01:15:30]  Because then you could vote in things, you know, if the mob says they want slavery back,  you know.  Again, that's a bad example.  Come on, my co-host.  I was very shocked to see a lot of African Americans are not very supportive of the gay  rights.  They're very conservative.  They're very conservative and don't like this at all.  Oh, is it called conservative when blacks are homophobic?  Right.  Is that what we call it? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, is that how that works?  When I do it, I'm a homophobe and a hater, but they're conservative.  Very good, Nick.  That's a great point, right?  Somebody call Hannity.  I'll be on next one.  No, they're very religious.  A lot of pastors, yeah.  They're really fucking like...  You've seen them?  Oh, yeah, and a lot of them are just fucking, you know, NFL players who hate games.  A little DL on the down low.  I actually want to see the Supreme Court decide on it.  Do you?  Yeah, when it's somebody's rights being taken away, like, I don't want...  I want people to be able to do whatever the fuck they want in this country.  No, I agree, too.  I'm just making a bigger point.  I don't care. 
[01:16:30]  It doesn't affect me.  They're not going to figure it out, though.  You know?  No.  They're not going to figure it out.  I think it's time.  I don't have a problem.  I'm just saying, though, the fucking logic and hypocrisy and the double stand.  What if I meet somebody in a dress and, you know, and they want to get married?  They.  Jimmy.  I never thought.  Yeah, I could give a shit.  Well, I don't understand the argument against it.  Like, you know, I'm not a left laner, but I don't even see the problem with it. 
[01:17:00]  What's the problem?  Yeah, I know, right?  Well, they always present it as, when they take your rights away in this country, it's  always presented as protecting something.  It's never like, we're going to take away your right for this or that or the other thing.  It's like, we're going to protect your right to this.  So this is the marriage, you know, they're protecting marriage from the insidious homosexual  who takes such a perfect institution like marriage where it goes off without a hitch all the time  and the wonderful couples together and ruin it with their disgusting homosexuality. 
[01:17:30]  That's what they're protecting.  Yeah, we made marriage a joke a long time ago.  Oh, please.  It's a joke.  Yeah, but how about the 60-plus percent end up in divorce, right?  Yeah.  Probably, and the rest are well over 50.  The rest are sound beatings.  But how about the whole slippery slope thing?  So if you allow, you know, if you want to marry an 18-year-old or a 12-year-old girl,  a llama, I mean, is that all?  12-year-old llama.  Is that infringing on your civil rights if I want to marry a llama?  Well, I pass an alpaca farm on the way here. 
[01:18:00]  I say we can do this.  How about we keep it species-specific?  Right.  You can marry anybody of the legal age in your species.  Okay, but I want to marry a monkey.  You're offending me.  Seattle's not going to agree with that.  They love their horses up there, so.  Oh, they sure do.  Well, then you need a group of, let's get the animal fuckers out there in the lobby.  Yeah, the horse people are up in the Seattle area.  It's Seattle, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was Seattle.  The guy got fucked to death by the horse.  Nobody will fight for that. 
[01:18:30]  Boy, that horse buried it deep.  Yeah.  Oh, he didn't know that horse was...  What a way to go.  That's what killed him?  What a horse got?  Yeah.  How do you think that's a good idea?  Just assuming the horse is going to do the right thing for him?  The horse is going to be gentle.  Right.  What the fuck?  That fucking horse.  Holy shit.  Horses love to bury it.  Everyone does.  They love to bury it.  Oh, boy, but a horse really loves to bury it.  Just stick the tip in it.  When you're sticking it in halfway and moving, you want to... 
[01:19:00]  The horse don't know he's going to fucking rip your guts out.  But a horse understands that it only has maybe five seconds, so it's going to bury it.  I would love to pull my cock out and have somebody's small intestines on it.  If I want that reaction, I have to fucking invent it.  Jesus.  Oh, jeez.  I'm just saying I'm a regular person.  I can't condone that.  It's something.  I can laugh at it, though.  I can repeat it at the next club I'm at.  There's a horrid video on, I guess it's LiveLeak or something, of a guy that's saying, fuck you, 
[01:19:30]  animal rights activist, and just shoots a horse right in the head.  And he's a fucking psycho.  Like, he pets the little horse on the head, and he's leading it out by...  It's a video?  Yes.  And he goes, hey, animal rights people, fuck you.  Takes a pistol, boom, shoots the horse square in the head.  And the horse goes down, and his legs go straight out.  It's fucking sick.  Why would you watch that? 
[01:20:00]  I couldn't watch that.  Why?  Because it's dead nugent.  He's a horse meat.  I couldn't watch it.  I understand the guy's a horse meat eater.  So he uses the meat for that.  But to parade the horse out, and do that as a fuck you, animal rights people.  And then the psychopathic thing was how he gave it a little rub on the head first.  That's like, you're a fucking lunatic.  Was he going to kill the horse anyway?  Yes.  There's another way of going about that.  It was bad.  You know, you bring up Pam Anderson, shoot her in the head. 
[01:20:30]  That's how you say fuck you're going to be a pig.  Look at his waist of tits.  And then there's another.  Yeah, that's very disturbing.  It's very disturbing.  Oh, I don't know if I can't watch it.  You probably don't want to watch it.  As I get older.  I'll watch somebody beheaded in the Middle East, but I can't watch it.  I can't watch that.  I can't watch this shit.  It's so bad.  I feel very bad.  No, I can't.  No, I'm not going to put the audio out.  Don't watch it.  As I get older, I get squeamish.  You'll hear him say, fuck you.  But I'm not watching.  I can't watch it at all.  You just hear the shot.  Let the record show I'm a pussy.  Me too.  You just hear the shot.  And him saying, yeah, see, look. 
[01:21:00]  He leads him out.  He gives him a little rub on the head, which is the...  Is it an old horse?  Tell me it was going to go to the glue factory anyways.  He was going to be made out of.  Look, he rubs it on the head.  What a prick.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's awful.  How'd you find this?  Horseshooters.net?  Oh, the poor little pony. 
[01:21:30]  I would have had more respect for the guy if he did it at a kid's birthday party.  With a kid riding it.  You'll hear some of that at Caroline's this weekend, by the way.  Oh, Caroline's.  I was going to ask you where you're going to be.  I forgot...  This is the reason I am where I am.  I'm not a big self-marketer.  No.  No, you never have been, Nick.  I've noticed it over the years.  You've got to push.  Yeah, Caroline's this weekend.  Push.  Starting tomorrow, Thursday through...  Saturday.  Okay, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Caroline's 212-757-4100, I believe.  Hell yeah.  Know that number by heart.  I found that video because I was looking at something Joe Rogan had posted, which he said,  very disturbing if you want to watch this, fine.  But if not, it's a high-speed video of a deer being shot in the head.  And then people started bitching at Joe for posting it.  He's like, I told you what it was.  Right.  I told you it's very disturbing.  Yeah.  It wasn't any kind of surprise.  You're going to click on this and see something. 
[01:22:30]  He told everybody what it was.  What a cocksucker, that guy.  Not because Joe Rogan was a cocksucker?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I wish he was.  I wish he was.  I'd date him and get better seats at USC.  You'd have to fight for him for Bob Kelly.  There it was.  No, this guy who shot the horse is a real cocksucker, man.  Oh, yeah.  What a cocksucker.  Of course.  Just that jerk-off cowboy faggot with a fucking cowboy hat on.  Yeah, yeah.  You fucking twat.  I'll tell you what, this deer getting shot in the head video, the deer looks very silly 
[01:23:00]  when the bullet goes into his head.  His eyes literally pop out of his head.  Why?  And his head splits completely in half.  Yeah, I can't watch that either.  It's terrible.  Why was he talking about that?  I'm really getting squeamish.  I guess because it's a high-speed video of a fucking head shot.  So it's kind of interesting.  I'll watch this in the photo film, but I'm not going to watch a deer.  Oh, it's terrible.  Is it because we're getting older?  Because I used to be able to watch a lot of this shit.  I've never watched a beheading video.  No, it is.  I get what happens there. 
[01:23:30]  I don't need to fucking see it.  The mortality factor.  I can't watch that.  I can't watch it.  And I never was able to see videos of people setting themselves on fire.  No, that's terrible.  That was brutal, too.  I got that back in the 90s.  I ordered this thing.  What was it called?  Faces of Death?  No, Justice...  What the hell was it?  It was from the Middle East, though.  I watched the first six men of it.  I know what it's called.  Justice meted out fairly.  Let's talk this over.  What the fuck was it called? 
[01:24:00]  Extreme Justice or something?  I don't know, but I watched the first seven minutes.  You ordered this online?  Seven minutes.  What?  You ordered this tape?  I had it mailed to my house.  It was like a VHS.  I was listening to Howard.  He mentioned it.  I'm going to order.  I watched the first six minutes.  Dude, I was having nightmares.  Yeah.  They tie a guy in it.  And I ran.  They tie a guy to a Jeep.  His arms...  Oh, shit.  They pull him apart.  Just pull him apart.  Yeah.  They drag him behind...  His arms pop off.  And they drag him behind the Jeep.  Holy shit.  And then they show a guy close up.  You know, half his face comes off.  They shoot him.  And he's still alive. 
[01:24:30]  And his jaw's gone.  Oh, God.  And it gave me nightmares.  Of course it did.  I laugh at people who get nightmares.  You're not supposed to see that shit.  I'm sitting up sweating.  You're not supposed to see that stuff.  I thought it'd be fun.  It'd be a break from the Tonight Show.  It's shit you can't unsee, which is the worst part of it.  Like those beheadings...  It's shit you can't unsee.  You can't unsee a beheading video.  It's going to be in your head forever and ever.  It's terrible.  No pun, I didn't.  Yeah, no pun.  No pun.  But yeah, Rogan showed that.  It's really sick, man. 
[01:25:00]  Like, I'm not a...  I love shooting.  I love, you know, being able to own guns.  But I don't hunt.  I don't mind people that hunt.  You do what you want.  But I can't...  I can't kill things.  I feel bad.  I get that weird fucking, like, feeling.  Even a little rabbit when I used to, like, hunt rabbits with a .22.  Well, as a kid, I could shoot...  I used to shoot pigeons off my grandmother's house.  They were shitting all over her house and stuff.  And I shot a pheasant.  I was in bed sleeping one morning.  And this is when I was in high school.  Senior in high school.  And they were building a house next to my house outside my bedroom window.  And it was just the foundation. 
[01:25:30]  And I hear this frigging pheasant going...  You know, making that stupid pheasant sound.  Yeah.  I open the window.  I'm in my underwear.  I get my daisy pellet gun.  Sure enough, ping.  Knock him off the wall.  He's flapping around.  I go running out there.  It's, like, 10 degrees.  I'm in my underwear and work boots.  And I'm pumping pellets.  Yeah.  You're pumping pellets.  Yeah.  And then I bring them up to my...  And my grandmother cooked them.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I go up there.  Delicious.  My grandma's from...  She could make a shoe.  She could make a mud on.  But I go up there.  Mud on with a little red sauce.  She's got the pheasant in one thing. 
[01:26:00]  And there's a bowl of, like, 60 BBs and pellets in it.  Really?  I like it was hit with a shotgun.  She's, like, saving the fucking beans.  Yeah, reuse them.  She wanted to use it for the sauce.  Exactly.  Give it that nice metallic taste.  Right.  But I didn't mind.  But as I got older, even now, I see a spider.  I use a...  You know, I'm like...  Do you let him out of the house?  Nah, he's still stepping up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck him.  I was being taken over by mice in my old apartment.  And I felt bad killing those fuckers, even.  With the electric traps.  I felt bad every morning. 
[01:26:30]  Electric traps?  Electric traps.  I don't have...  How does that...  Is it a little chair?  They get in?  You put a little Fincrum's down on it.  It was always creepy because it was in the kitchen.  When the kitchen's dark, I'm watching TV with all the lights down, and you would hear the...  You'd hear the...  You'd hear the zzzzt, and you knew you got another one.  It was just a quick zzzzt.  And then it would be a blinking light.  It was just creepy.  It would open up the top of the lid.  Like somebody scored a goal?  Yeah.  And you would open the lid.  Yeah, the big fucking red light.  And there would be a fucker in there. 
[01:27:00]  I killed...  I'm well over 50 or 60 that way.  I mean, I was infested.  I got a few.  Two downstairs.  Oh, get the...  Yeah, country myself.  They're a little black fucking rectangular traps.  Dead mouse walking.  But it's electric.  Yeah.  They go in...  Boogie-hoogie.  Sorry.  These things are made where they can't back out.  So they go in, they hit the wall on the left, so they turn and go to the right.  They walk the green foot.  And then a little peanut butter on the electric fucking circuit, and they're done instantly.  Yeah.  Yeah, they have like two contacts, where I guess his front legs are on the one set of contacts, 
[01:27:30]  and his back legs are on the other, and that's it.  I'll tell you.  Really?  It was zapped.  Someone on the show, I think, turned me on to the electric traps.  Before that, I went glue traps.  Oh, you don't want to go to glue traps.  You wake up in the morning, and you have this fucking mouse that is...  And he's kicking still?  He's still alive.  He's completely alive, but he's stuck sideways looking at you like, could you fucking help  me?  You feel like such dicks.  I'll leave your house.  I won't come back here.  I tried those, too.  And I tried to fucking scissor one out to give him a chance, because I felt so fucking 
[01:28:00]  bad.  I tried the glue, and every time I went down, there'd be three of them just sniffing it.  I had the black ones that they go in, and the thing just slams on them.  My wife doesn't want to see the actual...  I had the real old-fashioned ones.  Oh, got the old Victor traps that would just snap on them?  Yes, I tried those, but I lost like two fingers.  I love in the cartoons.  Growing up as a kid, those traps in cartoons, you'd see the mouse with his tail stuck in  it, and he's grabbing his tail like a rope, pulling, and you're like, oh, that's what 
[01:28:30]  happens.  You don't realize half his head is caved in in the thing, his fucking little rat teeth  are smushed out, blood is shooting out his nose.  Back of the neck.  It's a nice clean kill.  Nice clean kill.  But my wife freaks out, even when they're dead, you know?  There's one in the trap, go get it.  Then I put it on her pillow, you know.  My brother used to live on the Upper East Side, and he wasn't dealing with mice, he was dealing  with rats, and he has a whole bunch of stories where, you know, it was him and a bunch of  drunk fucking friends living together, and they would do battle with the rats with their  fucking frying pans. 
[01:29:00]  They got more than a few stories of doing the fucking battle.  I think my fucking place in Cliffside Park was infested with puppies, and every time  one would come in, I had a bat with a nail through it, and I'd crack his fucking head  and I killed about 64 puppies in that fucking apartment.  It's never infested with puppies or kittens.  Yeah, there's a fucking place downstairs that's fucking infested.  Or mottles.  Or mottles.  Mottles.  And we decided puppies and kittens are, you know, we don't kill them. 
[01:29:30]  We kill the rats.  We decided that rats are the ones that are the problem.  I want to see the fucking shooting video, Sam.  I want to see the fucking shooting video.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you saw it.  What was Joe's take on it, Andy?  Oh, the deer.  Hold on, hold on.  Before we move on, just because we're getting more info, the horse supposedly was dying in  that video.  So what?  It's dying.  The guy was still a deer.  The guy was an asshole.  You shouldn't fucking...  First of all, he's making a public spectacle of it.  Yeah.  And the fact that he gave it a little rub on the head shows that he's a fucking sociopath. 
[01:30:00]  Maybe he's showing him all of all.  Yeah.  I just got an idea for reforming social security.  Watching that video.  Yeah.  Come on, Gramps.  I'm out of the parking lot.  Hi, Grammy.  How are you?  Is that...  You just had your hair done?  Fuck you, AARP.  But put them in a good mood.  How old was that when you were my age?  Oh, I'm so happy you asked.  And before she answers, you fucking blow her wig off with a shotgun.  Ask me about my grandchildren.  Show me your charm blaze at well. 
[01:30:30]  You give her a brand new charm.  It's a shotgun.  She doesn't understand it.  I want to see the shooting.  All right, yeah, let's kick you on the lips.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to watch this one.  Rogan's take on this was that it was just kind of...  He puts kind of fascinating video up there of the solar system, you know, shit like that.  Joe puts interesting stuff up.  And this is a high-speed video.  So it really shows, you know, as Bunny from Platoon would say, that fucking head coming part.  Joe haunts now.  Does he?  Does he?  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  With a bow?  He seems like a bow and arrow hunter.  My cousin's a bow and arrow guy.  When I did his podcast, he had a nice...  He had a nice skull right on his desk.  Did he?  Yeah.  That was a girl from the funny one.  That was somebody beat up.  I know.  He kills deer with a...  Joe can chase down a deer and kill it.  Get it in a choke hold.  He fucking makes it tap out.  Right?  He's listening.  No fucks.  His little hoof is tapping out.  The little hoof is fucking choking him out.  I believe he just found hunting.  I think it's relatively new.  Did he?  I believe.  Fucking leg lock on a deer.  But then again, I took a baby hit, so I have no idea what he was saying that day. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I'll say.  Baby?  A baby hit, because I was scared I was going to look like a complete asshole.  First time smoked pot in a while.  Long fucking time.  Rogan's like, you're not escaping this.  So, you know, I'm either going to fucking blow in your face until you get high, or you're  going to fucking do it like a man.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So I took a baby hit.  I was scared.  Yeah.  It chilled me out.  That was nice.  Yeah, so his take on this was just the fact that it's kind of an interesting piece of 
[01:32:00]  video, but it's pretty twisted.  You see what happens in ultra slow motion when a deer gets shot in the fucking noggin.  Well, picture an Iran guy in Iran.  That's what they shot on the video.  Because this is the same shit that happens.  Go ahead, let her rip.  Let's see this.  There's a very same thing I can't watch.  Yeah.  What?  I used to be like that.  They make five clean and effective kills.  The animals dropping where they stand.  Long distance.  Click on the screen to watch that film.  We capture the first of those headshots with a high speed camera. 
[01:32:30]  Look at this poor dumb thing.  His eyes go.  But it does have merit to stalkers and deer managers.  However, we have restricted it to over-18s only.  It shows what effect a plastic or ballistic-tipped bullet has on a deer's head.  Oh, boy.  Is this Piers Morgan?  Holy!  I'll say that.  That deer went away quick.  Doesn't he look silly?  Yeah.  His eyes pop out.  Yeah, it looks like he's wearing a party hat filled with brains.  Hey, look. 
[01:33:00]  It's New Year's Eve.  Ten, nine, one hat.  The Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  The Boogie Nights.  It's fucking New Year's Eve at Jack's house.  That's what I thought you were talking about.  Completely took its top of his head off and the eyes split.  Yes.  Toward the side.  You gave the deer a moonroof.  That deer never fucking saw that.  Never felt that.  How to head shoot deer is what it's called, I guess. 
[01:33:30]  Shoot deer, if you want to watch it at home.  I can't picture you actually feeling that.  What?  That you have to do.  You're just dead.  Oh, that fucking deer didn't know what that is.  He's still, like, sitting there going, hmm, grass is great.  I love eating grass.  And then his head just fucking came apart.  Yeah, chew, chew.  Yeah, yeah.  And then before chew number three, it's fucking...  You know what I think I'm going to do today?  Eat some grass and drink some water.  Yeah, that's something.  You get hit with a, you know, a chara slap shot.  Sedena.  The whole top of his head fucking came. 
[01:34:00]  You realize what fucking Jackie probably saw when she looked over to the right.  Absolutely.  Just, ooh.  You got to fucking see if you're having.  No.  I will not watch that.  I watched the one when they killed that, uh...  Pearl?  Not Pearl.  Nick Berg, I think his name is.  The redhead.  Yeah.  Remember?  They just cut his...  Yeah, there's a lot worse ones now.  Yeah.  The Mexican ones are brutal.  They use, what, chainsaws and shit?  No, they're not, but they play fun music.  I swear to God. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, you're not kidding.  It's the Mexican hat dance, but his head's still in the head.  And Benny Hill music.  No, they play...  That would be horrible to release a beheading video of it.  No.  With this music.  When you look at the music they play, ah, but the turn of the lyrics, I'll lose my voice.  Is it really?  It's not, it's not, da, da, da, da, da, da.  It's like a, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  It's this weird, upbeat music while they're beating a guy with a bat whose head is duct tape.  Of course it's the same music if you go to a Mexican restaurant at your wife's birthday.  Yes!  The guy comes over with that big fat guitar. 
[01:35:00]  Is that it?  All purpose.  Their music is all purpose.  Yes!  That's exactly what it is as a head is being sawed off.  Wow.  Very disturbing.  Can't watch that.  It just takes a certain...  Kind of bummed I saw the deer thing just now.  ...mentality that just...  A certain kind of a saw.  It's devoid of any kind of empathy or, like, any...  It's amazing that people like that actually exist.  They can do it.  They have moments like that.  Yeah, they have moments. 
[01:35:30]  The audience members.  I mean, I have moments.  I could cut my wife's head off and go right to bed.  Sleep like a baby.  And other times, I'm making trouble doing that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the biggest concern.  What else happens in this video?  There's a lot left.  He shows, like, where he picks up a skull of a deer  and kind of shows where you're supposed to shoot him for the head.  But a lot of hunters are not really into the headshot.  Are you in deer territory where you live?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I get up this morning.  There's one making coffee in the kitchen. 
[01:36:00]  They're everywhere up there?  Oh, my God.  It's fucking hilarious.  When I come home late at night, I have to do it, you know, down my...  Yeah.  I almost, at least three times this year,  they jump right over the front of the car.  Fuck.  And there's one exit they hang right up at the Taconic when you get...  Exit 26 off the sawmill to get on the Taconic.  I don't know what's going on.  If they get cable there or what the fuck.  There's always, like, 60 of them just hanging out.  Really?  Yeah.  Very popular, that exit.  I don't know if they have relatives in the area.  There's one tree with a knot in it that looks like a deer vagina. 
[01:36:30]  That's as fuck.  They'll go glory hole it.  That's what it seems like.  They're lined up.  They have tickets in their hands.  They show this video, like, a lot of hunters don't like the headshot because if you miss,  it's got to be very precise.  If you miss, you can shoot their jaw off.  And they can run away.  And they can run away.  And, you know, now he can't eat.  And they can't tell their friends.  How much hurts so much?  What?  That's what deer snitches get.  What are you saying?  A lot of people want the neck shot or behind the leg, the heart shot, behind the shoulder 
[01:37:00]  and shit like that.  Do they die quickly from that?  Eh.  From what?  What shot?  The pussy's doing.  His head being removed.  But, yeah.  Not as fast as that head being removed.  Oh, shooting a deer's jaw off.  Yeah, yeah.  Suck.  Have you?  Can you just eat your back?  There have been deer that have bow hunters go out and the arrow's gone right through the  bone that holds the antlers on.  It's very thick up there.  And the arrow's gone right through it.  And he walks around like fucking Steve Martin. 
[01:37:30]  Looking all silly through the woods.  You think all the deer just laugh at that?  They just laugh.  And their dumb little deer brains.  With his fucking arrow in his head.  Why's he got a banjo?  Well, you did some fishing.  Sometimes you got to get that hook out and you leave that fish a mess as you throw it  back.  I caught it.  Do a little damage.  As a kid, I was fishing.  We were like, look, minnows.  And I caught one and somebody put a piece of straw through his gills.  What?  Yeah, I caught a fish that already had a piece of straw.  What the fuck is going on there?  Going through it.  This way. 
[01:38:00]  Where are you fishing?  Damn, damn, it's down at the end of my street.  The damnest Port River.  Jesus Christ.  It was sad.  I pulled it out and let him go.  Oh, that's nice.  I remember being horrified fishing and it's like, oh, the worst thing to hear was like,  oh, he swallowed the hook.  No kidding.  And then they get out the knife and the club and they're just beating him over the head.  What the fuck is it?  It's a mob hit.  But then someone sees him and goes, no hand, just a hooky head.  Laugh it up, lady.  I laugh when you come in. 
[01:38:30]  I hated taking those fucking hooks out.  Oh, it's terrible.  We got to take a quick break.  You're going to hang for a little longer, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Sure is.  We got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  It's been a long fucking time, man.  Good to see you, fellas.  On YouTube, Nick Dip.  YouTube?  Ah, fuck that.  Just go to my Twitter and go to nickdip.com.  All right, but you make some good videos, though, man.  All right, yeah.  I do?  Yeah.  You haven't made one in a while, but Nick DiPaolo on Twitter and you got Caroline's this  weekend starting tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 212-757-4100.  More with Nick. 
[01:39:00]  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on SiriusXM.  She was a prom queen who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend, punk.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him until...  No, no, it's Bobo.  Bobo Loco. 
[01:39:30]  Action.  Stop it!  Suspense.  Tell me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime.  Screaming for blood and looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop.  It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished him well. 
[01:40:00]  You could see that Pierre did truly love the madame was there.  And now the young monsieur and madame have run the chapel.  Se la vie, se the old folks.  It goes to show you never can tell.  Wow.  Voice like that. 
[01:40:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Tarantino's 50 today, so we're playing some of the music from his films.  We got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  He's playing Caroline's here in Times Square.  I guess we're officially in Times Square, right?  We're close enough.  And 212-757-4100 for Nick DiPaolo tickets.  I would highly recommend you go see Nick DiPaolo.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at Caroline's.  Get there, you order the Judy Gold Bitter Greens. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I know.  You could tell what that is just by looking at the outside.  After finding this flag in a box rescued from the garbage,  it has sat in my house for three years because obviously I have no use for it.  You are the only person I know who may have an interest in it.  So enjoy.  This is from Mickey, who just sent this,  and I can tell what it is just by looking at the...  It looks like it's going to...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:30]  Are you kidding me?  That's wonderful.  Can I have that?  Oh, gee.  That's, uh...  Wow.  Wow, this is...  You're not playing...  You're not playing anymore, are you?  It's not even real, though.  Of course, it's not in too good a shape.  I know.  If it was an actual World War II relic of a Nazi flag...  It would have some type of blood on it.  This is made...  It says we have made in Taiwan.  Exactly.  100% polyester.  Oh, nice.  I don't think Hitler would appreciate the fact that his flags were being made in Taiwan. 
[01:42:00]  Taiwan?  Clink, you are an idiot.  Clink?  He was very scary as a kid.  Dude!  Wasn't he?  The big one with the...  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, he would scare the shit out of me, that guy.  Like, fucking...  Colonel Clink was goofy, and Schultz was fun.  That guy's skinned.  But that guy was like, oh, shit.  Some shit's gonna go down.  This isn't a comedy anymore.  Even as a kid you knew, that guy's fucking...  He's in charge of the final smile or anything. 
[01:42:30]  No.  His character was like, Clink, you are an idiot.  Clink, you are an idiot.  And he was always on to the fact, he's like, hey, Clink, Hogan's fucking you.  The guy's fucking leaving the camp, pulling shenanigans, and you're an idiot.  Now, the guy that's saying that flag, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Was it somebody, like a real liberal person, saying that you're a Nazi, or that they did  it...  I think...  I mean, were they...  It's not just real liberals that say that.  No, I know.  It's historians.  Historians.  It's from Jacksonville, Florida, is where Mickey is from. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, but then he was sending us a gift.  Yeah, it's a gift.  The home of the sinkhole, I believe.  Ah, jeez.  Jacksonville, Florida.  I don't know.  I think all over Florida.  Yeah, I love the fucking life.  Nick was talking about the sinkhole during the break.  I guess we have another one that popped up, and there's a crack in a house somewhere.  They're trying to figure out if it's going to take the house.  Is that what's going on?  It just broke.  Yeah, yeah.  Another sinkhole or something.  A sinkhole?  What's that mean?  Is it sinking into something?  It's always gold from Chip.  Fuck yeah.  Go ahead, Nick.  I'm just amazed. 
[01:43:30]  I'm amazed.  I got nothing, Chip.  I was telling Nick during the break, I'm amazed they just barely, like, try to get that  guy out of the sinkhole.  Well, they gave it like an hour.  I mean, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  Well, we got a big debt in this country.  We can't be spending money on a safe guy.  Just showing you that his life was really not that important as far as the local people  go down there.  What the fuck did he do?  They did look for him.  They leaned in.  They go, hey, hey, hey.  You in there.  Kevin.  Kevin.  All right.  But, I mean, when JFK Jr.'s plane went down, man, they sent out a fucking, the Navy. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, exactly.  This guy falls in a sinkhole.  It's right there.  He's in there.  They gave it an hour.  Can you imagine?  But it was really fucking deep.  Yeah.  But can you imagine just being in your bed and all of a sudden you're, it's unbelievable.  I'm going to go home and flesh this better.  They wound up just getting a fucking backhoe and filling the hole in and they were like,  yeah, throw some fucking flowers on it.  I guess that's a good place to be buried.  His final resting place.  But still, man, for the family, you got to fucking give it a little more effort than 
[01:44:30]  that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They save money on a headstone.  Because, you know, what happens years from now if they sell the property or if they're  just renting or rent poltergeists.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  That'd stay out of that whole fucking neighborhood.  That's not an isolated thing.  I got to believe there's some structural damage in that neighborhood that spreads further  than his bedroom.  You don't think it was just that 10 by 20.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, maybe that's how they work to sinkhole.  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  Who knows?  It's sinkhole.  Because when you're in your bed at night, you feel that you're pretty damn safe.  That's what I'm saying.  That's like something that happened to you if you're a little kid having a nightmare.  There's a monster under the bed.  Yeah, yeah.  This is an adult version.  It's swallowed up.  And you saw the aerial view where it was just his room, basically?  Yes.  It wasn't even the whole house.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It was just his bed.  His friends are in the kitchen holding a cough and drinking cough.  What the fuck?  Can you imagine?  But it's not even a five-foot hole.  You fall 60 feet.  You fall six stories from your bed.  It's a 60-year-old. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, it's down.  But it probably was like crevices and all that shit.  Like, he was just gone.  But his brother said he was screaming, but maybe he just screamed on the way down.  You hope he wasn't trapped and suffocating.  Yeah.  Squished.  Always the dommer.  Buried alive, breathing.  I love how his monologue ends.  He's the monologue through the whole movie, and it just ends with, ah!  When he gets hit.  Who's that?  With the bat.  That is hard to watch, isn't it?  That scene? 
[01:46:00]  In a fucking casino.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see this video, Sam, of the teens that cut off this guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  It's a good video, right?  Now what?  I don't want to give away the punchline.  But I hear this video is really good.  I have not seen this one.  What happens?  Sam, tell me.  Can I watch this?  I hear it's a pretty good one.  Yes, you can see this one.  I promise.  I promise.  No, I promise.  What is it?  You can see this one.  I think you might even laugh at this one.  Sammy, let me see.  Don't read the headline.  No, because you can't.  None of these guys can watch this.  If I'm showing you something, don't look. 
[01:46:30]  No, I know.  They can't.  It'll be my cock.  Yeah, I got it.  It's funny, Zach.  Oh, what happened?  I was just going to give you a little backstory.  Not the punchline.  Give us the punchline.  All right.  Yeah, save some time.  Let's do this.  What happened?  What happened?  These teens cut this guy off.  Oh, right.  I remember this.  So this dude follows him to the kid's house.  Right.  And he approaches them in the car.  So that's where we're at now.  All right.  All right.  So he goes all the way to the house of the kid.  Right.  He's following him all the way home.  It's kind of ballsy.  Gets him home because he was cut off. 
[01:47:00]  You know, he's going to fucking show them.  Play this.  So the teens get out.  Oh, yeah.  He punched the teenager.  And the teenagers are punching the shit out of him.  They're beating the shit out of him.  Holy fuck.  Two on one.  Oh, they fucked him up.  He's like a girl.  Yeah.  They fucked that guy up.  Yeah.  But he's fine.  Oh, shit.  He pulls a gun out.  Oh, shit.  But he got beat up and then pulled his gun out. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  He's an idiot.  And started firing.  Holy fuck.  Did he fire?  No.  I heard a shot.  I heard a shot.  I thought that was a door slam.  He didn't shoot at anybody, though?  Just scared him?  That was the door.  But they said in the news after the video that he did fire at their truck.  Oh, he did?  He didn't hit anybody.  Wait, that was a door slam?  It sounded like a shot.  I think that was a door slam.  Wait, go back.  Play it again.  Just to that part.  Play it again.  Yeah, exactly.  But by the way, who's the broad?  No, that was a door slam.  What's Ann Curry doing there? 
[01:48:00]  The bottom line was this guy's a jerk off.  He is an asshole.  A, he punched the teenagers first.  Yep.  B, they beat him up.  The two guys knocked him down.  But while he was on the ground, they didn't fucking stomp on him.  No, no, no.  They walked away.  They walked away.  It was a very white beating, by the way.  Yeah, he threw him down, and they walked away.  They had beat him and walked away.  That's where it becomes a white beating.  They didn't proceed to stomp on his head, get 20 more of their friends,  just to fucking kick him, get some bitches to pull his hair, 
[01:48:30]  and smash his face into the ground.  That's right.  Yeah, they walked away.  There was no history of oppression there.  Right, right.  To fire him up.  Who was filming this?  What jerk off friend was it?  Maybe it was a girlfriend or something.  Another kid in the backseat or something.  Not helping.  He is a complete asshole.  He should have just taken his fucking beating,  and realized, like, oh, oops, maybe I shouldn't throw a punch at one teen  when there's another two in the car.  Or just walk up with a gun and point that at him.  If you're going to pull your gun, dummy, don't get beat up first. 
[01:49:00]  Pull it.  That's bad for gun owners.  That's going to make you upset.  That guy's stupid.  He's an idiot.  Believe me.  Did he actually fire a shot?  Do we know for sure?  I want to see what precipitated the incident.  Yeah, true.  Okay, yeah, like a jerk off.  So, you know what?  Believe me, not a day.  He should have wounded one of them.  Not a minute on the road goes by where I don't think it would be so nice  to pull a gun out and just shoot at fucking someone's car.  Yeah.  But, you know, as a responsible gun owner,  you've got to realize that's not in the whole list of things that are appropriate to do. 
[01:49:30]  That's why I'm buying the Popemobile, so I can do shit like that.  Yeah, you just fucking slink some lead.  Gotta love the new Pop.  You got the news story?  Let's play the news club.  Yeah, you want to hear it?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Oh, he's got a good black eye.  Oh, he's got a car dealership.  No, no, that's not...  Oh, literal Jimmy.  And here we go.  All right, there it is.  A couple charged in a road rage incident caught on tape 
[01:50:00]  that involved...  April Davis and Dave Jordan.  ...are free on bond tonight.  WITN had the only camera at the Lenore County Sheriff's Office  as Bradley and Christy Turner turned themselves in  shortly after 4 o'clock this afternoon.  Bradley Turner is charged with discharging a weapon into property,  two counts of assault by pointing a gun,  going armed to the terror of people,  injury to personal property, and assault.  He was released on $37,500 bond.  His wife is charged with two counts of assault by pointing a gun. 
[01:50:30]  Her bond was $1,000.  She had a gun, too?  All right.  I like the way the kids came out.  Yeah.  Oh, she handed...  Oh, figure's...  She's like watching her husband get beat...  Oh, maybe she...  Oh, yeah, she's got a gun.  She showed him the gun.  Yeah.  And then hand it to damn.  Like, here, honey.  I didn't even see that.  Oh, fuck, she handed it...  Now he's even...  He looks like a big a puss.  Maybe that's why they backed off. 
[01:51:00]  Bradley Turner has a first felony court appearance on Wednesday.  Maybe they would have stomped his fucking face.  Yeah, maybe she just didn't want to see him get beat up anymore.  And they're saying he fired.  Let me tell you something.  If she wasn't...  If she wasn't there and he had the gun,  he would have probably shot right away.  You know what I mean?  Maybe.  Just that little delay gave...  Right, a little cooler heads prevailed.  A little bit.  Just a second.  Otherwise, he would have hit them.  Right, right, right.  You know what I mean?  She handed him the gun.  Yeah.  Now, is that her being a cunt or her saying here just,  fuck, she gets an assist?  Wow, we would be horrible witnesses. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  I know, we watched it eight times.  We saw the movie.  Who's the broad?  Who's the broad?  He came out with a gun.  Right, we saw it twice and we didn't see the handoff.  She didn't do anything.  She just watched.  She's there loading it for ten minutes or in the background.  We would suck.  Yeah, we really suck.  She's adjusting the sight with a screwdriver.  There was two African-Americans.  God, how did I not see that?  I don't know.  What a country.  Yeah.  What a country.  I drive like an old lady now.  Do you?  I used to fly.  No, I don't. 
[01:52:00]  Sometimes you just kind of sit there.  I know I'm in a transitional phase.  Because sometimes I will just go like, I got to get around that guy.  I got to get around that guy.  Well, yeah.  And then I just go like, why bother?  Why don't I just let off the gas a little?  Why are you in a hurry?  And just fucking go.  What are you doing?  Racing in the next accident?  I don't want to get to work any early.  You give me a container of coffee, I drive nice and slow.  Go ahead.  What the hell do I know?  Regular Joe.  Container.  It's regular Joe.  A container of coffee.  A container of coffee in your buttered roll.  Yeah, you hurry up. 
[01:52:30]  You race to the next accident.  Get the new kid, the laborer.  Go down to the deli.  Get some fucking buttered rolls.  Containers of coffee for the men.  That's nice.  I think mine black.  A little milk.  A little.  Just a little.  There was a show that was on in the 70s.  Oh, bullshit.  No, all right.  There was no 70s.  No, there wasn't a 70s.  I wouldn't know.  I grew up in the 80s.  It was a cop show with... 
[01:53:00]  Oh, I'll tell you the name of it.  Just describe.  I'll give you the best line from that show.  No, Lloyd Bridges was in it.  And it was called Forest Gump.  Forest Management.  Forest Management.  Forest Management.  Forest...  Forest Whitaker?  Oh, no.  No.  Forest Asian.  Oh.  No.  Forest Fire.  Maybe it was his last name was Forest.  Joe Forrester.  Joe Forrester.  Joe Forrester.  Yes. 
[01:53:30]  Do you remember the show?  It was Lloyd Bridges.  Somebody put up the...  It was actually when they used to show the fall lineup coming up,  and they'd show you a promo for the show.  It's so incredibly bad.  But it was like regular Joe as a cop.  What do you mean Nick's got to bounce?  Got to bounce.  Yeah, I do.  Where are you going next?  Boomer and Cart.  Ah, the boomer.  That's why.  The TV shirt.  Tell fucking...  No, I just...  Tell Norman I said hi.  Tell fucking Norman Esiason that Anthony from fucking Timber Point Elementary School said hello. 
[01:54:00]  No, I like him a lot.  But we went to...  Elementary school?  Elementary school together.  Oh.  And he was like the big jock in school, and he used to treat everybody like shit.  He'd smack people in the back of the head, fart in their face in the cafeteria and shit.  Good for him.  I'm for the bullies, by the way.  Go ahead.  Do you like the bully?  His name was Boomer even back then, because his real name is Norman, and if you called  him Norman, he'd kick your fucking ass.  He was a Long Island guy, though. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that.  East Islip.  So one day I called him Norman from around the corner, like a real pussy move.  I ducked around one of the corners, and I went, Norman!  And I ducked back, and I turned to kind of chuckle and run away, and I see one of Norman's  best friends looking right at me going and nodding like, yeah?  Yeah?  So he told Norman.  I'll tell him you said hi.  And Norman goes, I'm going to kick your fucking ass after school.  And I'm like, oh shit. 
[01:55:00]  You know, I'm fucking 80 pounds, and he's a bruiser.  He looked like a man back then in fucking whatever it was, fifth grade.  A Viking.  Something like that.  Yeah, a Viking.  A Viking.  He does have a big, huge Viking head, doesn't he?  So we go out, square off.  I left my snorkel jacket on, because I figured it would pad any of the punches.  Yeah, and make you look a little bigger.  Yeah, yeah, something.  Because everybody would always take their jacket off to fight.  I'm like, fuck that.  As much padding as possible.  Were you scared?  I was petrified.  I was petrified. 
[01:55:30]  So I square off, and I throw the first punch right at his face, and hit him square in the forehead.  And as the doctor later told me, I broke my ulna and radius, two bones in my forearm, and just fucking broke it.  So now I'm fighting Boomer Esiason with a broken arm.  He pretty much kicked my ass right there.  So I hit the ground.  But again, being a white guy, he didn't stomp my head.  And the fact that it was the 70s, I guess. 
[01:56:00]  I have a similar story with Bob Greasy in junior high school.  Bob Greasy?  Yeah, he had a guy named Daryl Stigley had a running like that about two weeks ago.  All right, look, Nick's got to get out.  I've got to run.  So, you know, in closing, tell Norman I said hi.  I love that.  Fellas, thank you so much.  See you, buddy.  Nick's at Caroline's.  This week, right?  Yeah, come on out.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Nick is very funny.  I saw it last time.  It was maybe at Governor's or somewhere.  I don't know.  You didn't come up and say hi.  You know what? 
[01:56:30]  I leave the comics alone.  No, God bless you.  I let you do your talking on stage.  Exactly.  There's nothing worse than being backstage at a comedy club trying to make small talk with  the comic.  First of all, you know he's just thinking about the show and he's fucking there.  You don't want to talk about, you know, the yard and fucking, you know, with the fucking  I do say hi.  It's like, hey, how you doing?  But it's not the place for a long conversation.  Yeah.

[02:12:00]  come here come here come here mr malonagen come here  And the other dog, just unexplained.  Why does he care about the other dog?  Dressed exactly the same as the one that just disappeared.  I thought it was Mr. fucking Maluna cunt again.  I had no idea.  When it ran around the house at light speed.  Yeah, exactly.  Mr. Maluna douche.  A lot of the guys, like, he made two.  They liked that one better than the other one.  I liked the other one better.  Wow.  Well, what's great is you watch that and you're going,  yeah, but where does the story go?  What's the follow-up? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, it's a continuation, man.  And you don't have to wait because the follow-up,  that was called Mr. Malanajan is camera shy.  Right, what's the second one called?  The follow-up is...  No capital letters, by the way.  No, of course not.  It's called, even with bacon in my hands,  Mr. Malanajan is camera shy still.  He's got a whole web series, this son of a bitch.  And the description, of course, to get a little more information is, 
[02:13:00]  even with bacon, he is camera shy.  Right.  This is the one I really believe will go viral.  What category is this in?  This, let's see, this is in the category...  Ducks is an idiot.  He decided to stick with people and blogs.  All right, this is worth it.  Bobo is vlogging.  All right, so he's back in the snowy backyard.  Right, of course, Mr. Malanajan.  All he wants to do is get Mr. Malanajan on film.  That's shy.  The key that you have to remember here...  This is a little longer, this video, a little bit.  In the first video, Mr. Malanajan disappeared in the alleyway next to his house. 
[02:13:30]  Okay.  In this, right now, is when he said...  In this, the follow-up video, he follows Mr. Malanajan into the alleyway.  Wow!  So we get to see a little more.  A little more.  A little more of the curtains pulled back.  Another piece of the fucking puzzle.  The video puzzle.  That's right.  It's a concession.  I think this is the one that has enough going on that the internet might just fucking say,  fuck it, we're going to make this viral. 
[02:14:00]  We'll give it to you.  Yes.  All right.  Mr. Malanajan.  Here you go, Mr. Malanajan.  He's carrying bacon.  Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  That's for you, Mr. Malanajan.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Got you on tape. 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no.  I got you on tape.  Mr. Malanajan.  But the other dog grabbed the bacon.  Yes.  Rosie jumps up and gets the bacon, and Bobo is like, that's not for you.  He's trying to give it to Mr. Malanajan.  Oh, my God.  He's chasing Mr. Malanajan.  You can see the bacon, and it's right in front of the camera.  It was like bacon cam.  Yeah, all you see is bacon as he's trying to fucking give it to his dog there.  Could we please, please see that again?  Is that going viral?  Is that going viral?  From start to finish.  He should have made one video. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, this is not.  He should have made none.  No, I'm telling you.  Oh, this is perfect.  All right.  Let's see.  Mr. Malanajan.  Here you go, Mr. Malanajan.  He's chasing the door.  Malanajan.  On camera from the bacon.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  That's for you, Mr. Malanajan.  Got you on tape. 
[02:15:30]  Got you on tape.  That statement, what it means is that even though the other dog grabbed the bacon, Bobo  has this time outsmarted his dog, Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  I'm telling you.  Oh, that is fucking.  There's something there, right?  He found his fucking niche.  That's right.  Follow a dog who feels about him like we all do.  Get away from me.  Dog's barking his ass off.  All you see is the bacon cam. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, bacon cam.  What's my favorite part of that?  What are some of the comments?  I like the fact that he totally falls apart and he goes, Mr. Malanajan.  You can't say it.  The other dog's taking the bacon.  There's a few.  I mean, it starts nice.  Like, this is the greatest video I've ever seen.  Right.  Thumbs up for Mr. Malanajan.  Ah ha ha ha.  And then it starts going into Mr. Madouche again.  Right.  Wait, the dog is just tired of your shit?  Tired of your shit?  Ha ha ha ha. 
[02:16:30]  Caesar Retardo.  Caesar Retardo.  Right.  It's like a zombie movie.  Yeah, yeah.  I would run from him also.  It's not the camera that Mr. Malanajan doesn't like.  Yeah.  And the comments keep coming in.  Well, this one just says Sam's a fad.  Oh, wow.  It's not even necessary.  I'm trying to share this with everybody.  Jesus.  Yeah.  But yeah, so it's.  That's fantastic.  It's up to 14 likes, 6 dislikes.  Wow.  Which is still pretty good. 
[02:17:00]  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  He's the new dog whisperer.  I got you what tape.  Mr. Malanajan's like, shut up, you cunt.  I heard you.  I hate bacon.  He can't even bribe Mr. Malanajan with bacon.  No.  Oh, boy.  Is he going to be thrilled?  That he is an internet sensation, first of all.  And we talked about him on the show.  That's right.  I want to be on the show.  Maybe I'll call in tomorrow.  And he's not even awake to fucking talk to us right now. 
[02:17:30]  This counts as him being on the show.  This counts as an appearance on the show.  I hope so.  Yes.  Internet sensation.  I, by the way, can't wait to see the third installment of Mr. Malanajan.  Yeah.  I hope it's Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  It's called Mr. Malanajan.  Fucking wraps around a Buick tire and is dragged down the street. 
[02:18:00]  Is he going to continue with Mr. Malanajan or is he going to go off in another direction?  He's not smart enough to continue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll blow it.  He'll blow it and go in another direction.  Mr. Malanajan, I mean.  Malanajan.  Right.  The videos are up on Obi and Anthony on Facebook.  Nice.  Wow.  Why did Eric put viral in quotes like it's not really viral?  Oh.  Because he's a fucking jealous asshole.  What's wrong with you?  You are jealous.  They haven't gone viral yet. 
[02:18:30]  You don't think they're viral videos?  Not yet.  It's a given.  It's going there.  Were you laughing?  Yes.  Laughing at him.  Mr. Malanajan.  The bacon in the fucking forefront.  Here you go, Mr. Malanajan.  Dog's like, leave me alone.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  That's for you, Mr. Malanajan.  Got you on tape. 
[02:19:00]  It's the way he incessantly says the dogs.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  It's like you're annoying all beasts.  Imagine the neighbor.  Do you see how close together those houses are?  Imagine being Bobo's neighbor.  I live that close.  Bobo's singing hi.  There was more room in the fucking trash compactor in Star Wars.  I swear if you ever see that.  Imagine the people that live in the same houses.  Jesus.  Huh? 
[02:19:30]  Well, he lives in, he shares a house.  Like, you know.  That's how most of those houses in Queens are.  Yeah.  So imagine having them.  It's like calling the family.  Yeah.  He gets the left side of the yard.  The other people get the right side.  No, I think he's got upstairs, downstairs.  I wish he shared it with his bestest fucking web paint.  I wish he shared it with his sing-hole.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  Mr. Malanajan.  He just forgets what his dog's name is.  Of course the other dog got the bacon.  Yes. 
[02:20:00]  So it's too late to say that bacon was for you.  Rosie got the bacon.  Mr. Malanajan gets nothing.  But still, in the end, he has to say,  got you on tape.  As if to tell the audience,  I was successful here.  Not that other dog.  I got you on tape.  I think he could do it.  Yeah, this is a biggie.  This is going to be like Apple 5.  Could be.  All over again.  Mr. Malanajan.  I got bacon.  I got you on tape.  He's going to get 6,000 views. 
[02:20:30]  No.  You don't think he's going to be on CNN's morning show?  Oh, look.  A dummy chasing his dog for six seconds.  Mr. Malanajan.  They're not going to find the...  Oh, listen.  Man gets dog on tape.  They're not going to laugh at this part.  Well, they're not going to laugh when he goes,  Mr. Malanajan.  Hey, listen to the guy with fucking Asperger's falling apart.  You don't think one day we'll be sitting here and go,  wow, the video's up on every screen.  How many retard home videos... 
[02:21:00]  Do you know how many people have videos of the retarded children?  They don't go viral on CNN.  Hey, look at Donnie eating an electrical thing.  Hey, look.  Here's Becky throwing a pancake at the window.  Becky.  Do you know how many videos we enjoy that other people won't?  Of course.  If beheadings don't go viral, this fucking dummy has no shot.  It's going to do very well.  Maybe not viral.  It's going to do well. 
[02:21:30]  I'm telling you.  Hey, Paul Anker's coming in here in a few days.  When?  Next week?  The band gets shirts.  Oh, next month?  All right.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Soon, right?  Yeah.  Got to ask him about that.  Well, I hope he talks because he looks like he's wound a little tight.  He always has, right?  When he did the band gets shirts, you know?  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  He wound up pretty tight there.  I bet you we played those tapes at least six years ago already.  I bet you.  Iraq? 
[02:22:00]  Comento?  Do you got one of the Paul Anker clips for everybody?  Yeah, I'm pulling them up.  Hang on.  I know there was a whole bunch of them we played, but the famous shirt one, you got to replay.  There's ten cuts, but I have the shirts one here.  Yeah, let's hear that.  The great Paul Anker.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight.  You're on fucking notice, John.  I gave you a list.  You had half a list that I gave you.  We're choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me. 
[02:22:30]  The guys get shirts.  Do you understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts.  Wow.  Wow.  Give him someone to talk into.  That guy is pissed off.  Right.  Imagine if he had a deal with management here.  Ugh.  Of what he would say.  He'd be mad like that every day.  Yeah.  The guys get buses.  Any other clips worth playing?  I'm trying to remember.  They were all great. 
[02:23:00]  They were all great.  I remember.  What did anyone?  Yeah.  Just randomly pick one, Mr. Rock.  There you go.  There is a lot of loose shit going on, and I'm telling you, you guys are thin ice.  All right?  I'm telling you right now.  And when I fucking move, I slice like a fucking hammer.  Oh.  You've seen it, and I'll do it again.  When I tell you the band, you better look and make sure everybody's here when you walk  in this room.  I will not put up with this shit.  You understand that?  That's just the fucking way it is.  Every one of your fucking checks cash with the amount on it. 
[02:23:30]  Do any of your checks bounce?  Do y'all get full value on your money?  I want full value on your fucking service.  Do you hear me?  Wow.  He's right.  What a prick.  He's right.  You know what?  Wow.  Do any of your checks bounce?  Huh?  You know what he's saying?  He's saying your fucking talent is bouncing.  Your fucking enthusiasm is bouncing.  What could the guys be doing wrong, though, really?  You know what?  They're not marrying in, sloughing off, being sloppy.  Putting up with his shit is probably worth it.  He wrote my way. 
[02:24:00]  Fuck the band.  He wrote my way.  There you go, Jimmy.  You tell them.  He wrote my way.  I'm surprised they didn't fucking say that to them.  I wrote my way.  But he wants it his way.  That's who he is.  Why would he hand over that song like that?  No one knows he wrote my way.  Oh, I've heard a few.  Then again, the guys get fucking shirts.  Got another one to play.  Now I kind of want to hear these.  I know.  They're good.  Iraq.  Oh, Iraq doesn't want to play it.  Iraq doesn't want to. 
[02:24:30]  Iraq, what do you suggest, then, for the show?  What do you think we should go to?  Give me some fucking knowledge in here.  Tell me what's wrong.  He's the only one with his hands up, and he cuts off.  Now give me some intelligent fucking answers.  Who are you watching?  Who are you watching?  Ain't you watching it, Hooper?  The reason my way, he actually has sang that song.  Yeah.  No, I know, but most people just have no idea that it's his song. 
[02:25:00]  And that was a big hit for Frank Sinatra.  No, it was because the way he sang it wasn't, it was like, he was like, you did it in a really weird Calypso version.  Oh, no.  Oh, mistakes, I made a few.  But then again, the few dimension.  I did it, mate.  I went.  Nobody liked it.  So he said, oh, fuck here, Frank.  Yeah, I didn't care for him.  Here's a dumb throwaway song that didn't work for me.  I ate it up and spit it out. 
[02:25:30]  I did it, mate.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  He would always just say, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Put the emphasis on the wrong way.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Regrets I've had.  Iraq, any more clips from the Paul Anka?  Now, guys, I'm giving you all one week to get this together.  Week?  Okay?  I'm giving you one week to play that music the way it's supposed to be better.  I'm giving everybody one week. 
[02:26:00]  Everybody's got one week to do it right.  Because I'm in my form right now.  If you guys are not going to come up and support me with the enthusiasm I've got for it,  it ain't going to work.  I'm going to put more on that stage.  And you are letting me down.  Do you understand that?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Do you understand that?  Wow.  As he jumps into his roles and goes back to his mansion in Beverly Hills. 
[02:26:30]  Right, and these guys are fucking getting hurt per diems.  Right, scared shitless.  Yeah, yeah.  They're not going to be able to pay their fucking phone bill.  Holy fuck.  Un-fucking-real, huh?  I mean, how many we got left?  I mean, if we're this far along, maybe we play a few more.  They're all gold.  Yeah, four more left.  You know, we probably should play all.  We should.  Unless Iraq has a problem.  Yeah, Iraq.  Is this going well so far?  It's going fine.  Here it is.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  and lean your fucking asses  like the coach of a ball team 
[02:27:00]  or any god damn business  till you get it  you understand that  cause if you don't feel embarrassed about it  and you have no conscience  you got no heart  you got no integrity  you understand that  then all you do  is you take the fucking money  and you got no substance  remember that  people of substance and character  care about what the fuck they do  when they fix it  ok  and I think you're working with me  because I think that's the way you are  and I don't pull any punches  when you guys  I am telling you that his job  is on thin ice  and you know how fast I move  I don't care if you're a light man

[02:33:30]  the windshield  and goes right across  this guy's like  line of sight  right across his chest  it skins him  what does the  description say  so basically  there was a  car crash  this is in  one of those  rooftop countries  I see some  Chinese writing  yeah rooftop writing  yeah it's in  it's in China  okay  in Jiang  in Jiang  is that the  X1  what province  is that in  X-I-A-N  no Z-H-E  Z-H-E  yeah  so a ramp post 
[02:34:00]  so there's a car crash  yeah  on the other side  two cars  collided into that  lamp post  the lamp post  falls  yeah  and the lamp post  falls into the bus  he didn't drive into it  that must just happen  like every block  in China  it's just  fucking  it's just  awesome  oh no  oh no  oh my goodness  I bet they don't have  cute car insurance  commercials  no  in China  they're losing  a fucking 
[02:34:30]  boatload of money  yeah  so then this guy  was able to avoid  no one's fucked up  about that  if the guy  would have like  forgot something  at his house  before he went  to work that day  or something  nothing  then they wouldn't  have happened  he'd have jammed  down the brakes  it has to be  perfect timing  for this fucking  thing to happen  fuck  so he avoids  but he avoids  the lamp post  and then got the bus  to a stop  and  then he helped  the passengers  get off  he's a good egg  what do you mean  he avoided  he didn't avoid  no avoid getting  hit himself  oh  no  Jesus  he didn't  that was pure luck  yeah  thank you 
[02:35:00]  pure luck  pure luck  so he's driving  oh he sees an axe  oh my  it looks like  it hits him  do they do it  I mean  dude  he's gotta go  slow mo  on this video  he fucking  he did get out  of the fucking way  I think he dumped  just in time  could you  like freeze it  as it's going through  as usual  oh god  it looks like  it hits him  it's hard to see  I would have  I would have thought  his head got ripped off  yeah man  that's violent 
[02:35:30]  shit  that is a violent  fucking  but he did duck  he ducked  I mean like you said  if he had been  one  fraction of a second  off  his head would have been  crushed  go to the other video  did they go slow mo  or any of that shit  it's hard to see  because all the glass shattering  slow mo was made for this  and look he's trying to steer  or something  the steering wheel's gone  see he gets up  and he starts helping people  oh you hit  here's the slow  oh my god  dude it looks like  it hits his head 
[02:36:00]  wait a minute  obviously it doesn't  it looks like  it hits his shoulder  he's able to get up  after that  it knocks him back though  you can see the force  knocks him backwards  like watch  he ducked  he ducked  he just got out of the way  it's the seat  he fucking ducked  he's still strapped to the seat  yes  and the lamppost hits the seat  oh what the heck  oh my god  they got another angle  there's a lamppost on the bus  there's a lamppost on my bus  I got a lamppost in my lap  holy shit  Godzilla  look at them  wow  wow 
[02:36:30]  look at this  holy shit  it's amazing  how the fuck did he survive  how that guy is alive  the lamppost penetrates through  the windshield  yeah  and then it's literally  affixed above  the steering wheel  right where your head would be  he could have been killed  oh  you think so  much easier than  not being killed  like that was a fluke  that he wasn't killed  right  I saw something like that once  yeah  what was it  guy just threw Daryl's story  for no reason  no no I know  I've seen it 
[02:37:00]  and then in  related videos  Gangnam Style comes up  which seems very racist  Gangnam Style  because that's Asian  you ever hear that song  some type of Asian thing  I heard this song Joe  yeah the Gangnam Style  yeah get your roll  get your coffee  Gangnam Style  that's what I know  whooppa Gangnam Style  yay it's raining  bring the mortar  what the hell do I know  whooppa Gangnam Style  jump up and down  I'm so tired from work  I got gout  do the kids like this music  I didn't listen to this  ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

[02:38:00]  it's worked out well for Sigh  not performing this song anymore  hasn't she  he's still all over the place  he went on to the next hit  you follow this  Tiger Woods story  it's on CNN right now  but everyone's going with it  fucking assholes  Tiger Woods is now  number one in the world again  after two to almost three years off  yes  and  great great  there's a big quote  basically saying 
[02:38:30]  winning takes care of  of anything  is it anything or everything  everything  yeah  or is it anything  now I'm trying to remember  and everyone's outraged  because they're like  oh he's down playing  all that shit he did  with his wife and stuff  cheating on her and all  no one's fucking business  but that's not what the quote is about  he's been using this quote for a while  because you know  he has all his detractors and shit  so it basically says  you can shut up everybody by winning  yeah  but they're  they're extending it 
[02:39:00]  and making it  you know  all his life  yeah  he's taking care of everything  by winning  you think that's  it's a non-story  but it's  it's  it's going everywhere right now  what is the exact quote  is it winning takes care of anything  or everything  um  everything  everything  that's a great moment  and justice for all  and Pacino says  it's going to be alright  winning  it's everything  it's everything  yeah  so everything or anything  everything  everything  okay  but that's  he's been 
[02:39:30]  he's been saying that for years  yeah  but now they're saying  oh look  he's just downplaying the fact  that he you know  fucked 800 women  behind his wife's back  that isn't  uh  whatever  it's a non-story  is my point  yeah  yeah  go for  go for him  I think he's been using that  uh  I think he's been saying that  since like 2009  or something  he's been saying it all  a long time  as soon as you're number one  then say whatever the fuck you want  but you know 
[02:40:00]  he's number one  he's back on top  right  uh  yeah  that's gotta be rough  gotta be rough  for what  I don't know  he's gonna be  just  have that  hanging over his head now  all the time  the Perkins waitress  the fucking  nah he's got the new broad now  so that's where they're focusing on  although like I said yesterday  I  I love  thinking that some of those  dumb whores  thought he was gonna  oh  go marching into a  a Perkins  and carry him out  like Officer to Gilliband  I love that 
[02:40:30]  get the fuck out of here  that image  just comes in  they all were hoping  when he cleans up  you know  his marriage and stuff  and gets the divorce  that  he was coming back  for one of them  got a golf club in his hand  right  walking into Perkins  I don't think so  he's looking for  the fucking  woman is stacking  napkins  and she looks over like  oh  who's he here for  I was hoping for this moment  she's wiping blueberries  on her fucking  of course  when he figured it all out 
[02:41:00]  he was gonna go for another  high profile relationship  yeah  not one of those dummies  we probably should break  because then when we get back  we could talk to Mark Burnett  all nice and shit  nice  what is he promoting  the bible  I thought it was Carol  yeah the bible  Carol Burnett would be nice  I thought I'd talk to her  Mark Burnett  no no  the bible is not  he's promoting the fact  that  I have tickets  that are on sale  for my Somerville theater show 
[02:41:30]  totally sold out  there's actually 12 tickets  for each show  that are going on sale  for 1pm today  for what  my Somerville show  they release tickets  because they  what's Somerville  my Boston show  oh  there's two  for both shows  there's camera kills  during this  so they reconfigure  certain things  and when my comps  are released  then they know  exactly how many seats  we have  15 lucky people  for the first show  and 18 lucky people  for the second show  ooh  someone's going 
[02:42:00]  to Jim Norton's show  it's supposed to be  40 a show  but then there was a mistake  it's not that many  yeah  but Jim loves his fans  so much  yeah  and he wants everybody  to enjoy his  funniness  Emily has her tickets  she just showed him  here on camera  her Jim Norton tickets  Emily  is that Bruce's daughter  oh god  and I'll be  back in China  and uh  April 11th through 14  I'm here in the  Big Apple Carolines  and then finally  New Jersey again 
[02:42:30]  Stress Factory  Memorial Day  by the way  there was a reason  why we brought up  all that Paul Anker shit  it was leading  to a new thing  oh was it  we never got to it  damn  you can play real fast  yes please  Paul Anker says  Jay Z won't return  his calls  he's pissed off  at Jay Z  I know  Jay Z  he was real yappy  with TMZ  which makes me think  he'll be a good interview  I bet  I bet  how old is Paul Anker  he threw the n-bomb out  that's it  maybe more  I bet he threw  the n-bomb out  really exciting 
[02:43:00]  any rappers  no rappers  no rappers  I thought about it  but I didn't really know  which of my songs  would land  what I did do  is I called up  Jay Z  because  Jay Z  he did a track  on my way  where I loaned him  a track  I wanted to put him  in on a rap  with Michael Jackson  in the middle  I called him up  but Jay Z  has totally blown me off  he won't answer my calls  he's inappropriate  in his behavior  I love his wife  I think she's great 
[02:43:30]  but Jay Z  wouldn't return the call  what  does he know  who's calling him  it's Paul Anker  what's wrong with this guy  he's too busy  with his clothing line  who knows  you know who he sounds like  Donald Trump  oh a little bit  he has kind of that same  like delivery  Paul Anker  sorry Paul Anker  being blown off by Jay Z  I'm like Jay Z  Jay Z  you know  back in my day  if a spade  treated a white guy  like that  right Paul  yeah  the guys get  water fountains  you know who the most 
[02:44:00]  important person  on that stage is  Jim Crow  the guys get hoods  the guys get hoods  I'm telling you  we're not gonna be  as weak  as the weakest  fucking  I was trying to tie in  slavery chains  with the weakest link  chain a weak link  don't make a fucking  tolerated person out of me  don't make a fucking  second hand  second  oh boy 
[02:44:30]  Jimmy  I'm improv-ing  yuck  wow  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  yeah  this  is the  OPN Anthony Show  hey man  we gotta get right  to the phone  Mark Burnett  sounds alive  everyone on the phones  though don't go anywhere  especially on Paul and PA  just hanging there  hey Mark  hey how you doing  how you doing 
[02:45:00]  we haven't talked to you  in years  it has been years  years and years  and years  but wow  you're in the news  on TV  the Bible  the Bible  that's right  this thing is epic  what's really funny  is the amount of people  who rolled their eyes  at me and said  that's crazy  who's gonna watch  the Bible  and I said  you wait and see  yeah  the trailers for it  before it even aired  looked very compelling  you know  it's a grand show  very big 
[02:45:30]  yeah  I like it  and first episode  was seen by 13.1 million people  you don't get numbers like that  these days  no you know  actually the last four episodes  now has added up to  80 million people  have seen  the last four episodes  and you know  even on iTunes  the downloads  are number one  on the Bible  you know  it's a nation  built on the Bible  yeah  what made you want to do  a story about the Bible  like what did you say  okay we could tell this story  differently  what was it that inspired you  to tell it differently  you know 
[02:46:00]  Roma and I  saw an idea  for a documentary  someone else was gonna do  just saying how awful  God was  and trying to use  negative stuff  and Roma said  why don't we just do it  per the word of the Bible  and I said  Roma come on  the whole Bible  she said  I'm telling you  we could do it  it's like the 10 commandments  but the whole thing  I went for a bike ride  came back  and said  you know  let's just do it  and we never looked back guys  in four years  and it all came together  and of course  as you see now 
[02:46:30]  it's been the number one show  on Sundays on cable  how long is the entire  the entire series  the series is 10 hours  but we've aired it  over five weeks  and the finale  is this Sunday  which is Easter Sunday  and it ends up  this Sunday  is the crucifixion  oh man  you're giving it away  yeah  come on  spoiler alert  you'll be funny  if you just change it  I know you guys  have read it  I understand  all your listeners  know you read it  I live it 
[02:47:00]  yes  wow  so what do you  attribute that to  that a lot of people  are watching this  I think  it's this nation  I mean  one nation under God  it's the foundation  of the nation  well people like to say that  but the truth of the matter is  I don't think people  really adhere to it  and to watch it  I mean  you know  religious programming  has not always been  gangbuster  you know what I mean  well I would say  Passion of the Christ  did 600 million dollars  at box office  it wouldn't do it 
[02:47:30]  and this is  the Bible right now  is the number one series  yeah  the proof is the numbers  right  and actually  there was a study  came out yesterday  that said the numbers  are kind of low  that one in four Americans  have now seen a part  of the Bible series  that's amazing  we've got to ask you  about the Obama thing  everyone thinking  Satan looked like Obama  it must have been  a slow news day  it must have been  a very slow news day  yeah  well  the pictures they put  next to each other 
[02:48:00]  did kind of  but there wasn't any  intent on doing that  I'm sure  but you know  people  someone's screen grab  I think they adjusted it  if you look at it  on the screen  you can see  it's got silver makeup on  made to look  deathly white  it's the devil  there's no life  in it whatsoever  anybody can make  anything look any way  no we would never do that  especially  we love the Bible  we love the series  yeah  and it just took away  from the message  a little bit  I thought it insulted  Satan to tell you  the truth  I'm not a big Obama 
[02:48:30]  supporter sir  and the guy you use  he's a Moroccan actor  and he's done  roles like that  in the past too  right  yeah  he played Satan  before  he actually played  Satan before  who you got  playing Jesus  Diogo Morgado  who is a  Portuguese guy  he's going to be  a big big star  if you go online  and look him up  you'll see  in this  there's clips online  he plays a great role  plays the lion and the lamb 
[02:49:00]  and does a great job  and something else  you say to you  look  so this is number one  the voice came back  number one  Shark Tank  number one  Apprentice is winning  at 10 o'clock  and Survivor is about  to be idle  all our shows  are number one  and they're all  family friendly  so there's something  to that  crazy  we used to talk to you  when you did the  Survivor thing  when you're still doing it  but I bet you  watch from afar  hey did you go with  the blue eyed Jesus  he's actually Hispanic  oh Hispanic Jesus  Hispanic Jesus

[02:53:00]  he might have forgotten  but uh  Nick DePaulo  yeah  he seemed very hesitant  to even go there  and bring it out  he was on  the Boomer  Boomer show there  and he  mentioned that  because I told  I told Nick DePaulo  the story  when he was just here  about how I got  in a fight with Boomer  and I guess he brought it up  we used to live  in the same neighborhood  in elementary school  what did he say  he said  to start off  he said that  one of the first things  he brought up  was that he remembers  your house  and he referred to it  as the monster's house  because the lawn 
[02:53:30]  was never mowed  there were vultures  that hung out  on the roof of your house  vultures  let me tell you something  sir  and Boomer  uh  uh  my mother  was trying to raise  the kids  when uh  dad wasn't really around  to push the old lawnmower  alright  he was pushing his dick  into some fucking  young chippy  in Connecticut  what's that  and the lawn  was mowed  so was the sun  Jesus Christ  wow  son of a bitch  I think we got  the clip actually 
[02:54:00]  yeah  yeah  thank you Paul  uh  he calls you  Eddie Munster  he said the way  your house looked  and the way  you would walk  out of your house  oh man  Eddie Munster  with an afro  slowly going crazy  beard  that's what  Eric has  alright let's  listen to this  sorry we all  didn't have dad  to fucking  throw the old  football around  with us  uh everyday  boomer  like you  dick  I just came from  O&A right  oh  Mr. fucking  uh  uh  gym teacher  sweetheart  how'd that work 
[02:54:30]  out for  oh  dude  here's uh  Nick DiPaolo  on Boomer  and Carton  yeah  yes  I just came from  O&A right  and Anthony  Comey said  tell  you know the story  he tried to hit me  he actually hit me  and he broke his arm  that's what he said  his wrist and forearm  disintegrated  Dave tell the story  we got to a little  altercation  and  were your friends  at that point  yeah he lived  right down the street  from me  now when you go  past his house 
[02:55:00]  on Country Village Lane  and anybody who's  living out in East  Iselt knows this  he had a one level  house  it was just like  a ranch house  but it was like  the Munsters  I mean nobody  cut the grass  there were like  vultures  flying over it  all the window shades  were pulled down  and he had his  brother in there  I think he had a hot  mom I think  if I remember correctly  that would be Marilyn  right  and somehow he and I  got into an altercation  over something  I forget what it was about  come on  what was it  that's what I want to know  I really forget what  it was about  but I remember  he figured okay  he's small 
[02:55:30]  he's going to take  the first shot  so let's see what happens  and he kind of  caught me off guard  because he hit me  right on the side  of the head  and he was like  are you okay  how embarrassing  he had to say  are you okay  I kicked my own ass  on Boomer's head  oh that's great  right on the side  of the head  and he was like  are you okay  I think I broke my arm  I think I broke my arm  you're the only guy  that gets punched  in the head 
[02:56:00]  and I look at the guy  are you okay  the thing about it is  I didn't know  whether to hit him back  or not  I feel sorry for him  and you were huge  you're the most  size were enough  no it wasn't this heavy  I was tall and skinny  but he hit me  in the side of my  Norwegian square head  did you punch him  afterwards or no  I can't remember  I really can't  I really can't  all I remember  is that he was  like a little  like you know  he came out of that  house  like Eddie Munster  and you know  it was like  just a weird deal  the best is  boomers got on with them  and they've talked  they've lived it out  they've been telling  the story for like  what 30 years  I've been a fan 
[02:56:30]  of theirs for a long time  and I always knew  the story  and then the one time  I'm listening  when I'm the Jet  quarterback  and he starts  talking about it  and I'm like  damn  I'm in a fight  with Joe Kapp  in junior high school  he's 70  isn't he Joe Kapp  did you take him  or no  oh I smacked him  silly  were you looking  over Joe Kapp  do I punch him  or do I help him  back out  what I remember  about that though  was a very  very weird  kind of whole thing  after he hit me  weird in what way 
[02:57:00]  because I didn't know  whether to  because I knew  he was hurt  because I think  he started crying  but I didn't know  whether to beat him up  or to help him  go to the hospital  that's very nice of you  that's how we know  you were a quarterback  if you were a linebacker  you would have stomped  I just kind of felt bad for him  I never heard any other guy  that got in a high school fight  got punched in the head  and goes  I'm not sure what I should do  right now  it was like  one of the weirdest things  you gotta give him credit  that we got a punch off  and he connected  he did  he kind of surprised me  they all remember that 
[02:57:30]  when I went to  WNW do mornings  I got greeted by ONA  who obviously didn't care  about any of the show  at the point  at that time  they were killing it  they got  who's the new morning guy  what is this  Minuto  what did we say that  we might have  we probably did  they were bringing in  so many different mornings  yeah  that's why  Cardin  wow  they put so many guys  in front of us  we knew they were  they were going to be  there for only a little time  it's so fucking funny  he's kicking ass now man  holy fuck  yeah yeah  they're doing really well  he was part of the sports guys  on WNW  sports guys 
[02:58:00]  sports guys  what's his name  yeah what the fuck was his name  oh help me out  oh I know  Sid  Sid  Rob Rosenberg  of course  yeah  Sid has had his own issues  over the years  no they're fucking great man  everybody  everyone loves Boomer and Cardin  they do a really good job  that's funny  it is  you hit him so hard  he felt bad for you  and he forgot he was in a fight  and wanted to help you  Boomer's also really  a nice guy  very charitable 
[02:58:30]  like he does a lot of  charity work and stuff  so  no he's a guy  he was a prick on wheels  as a kid  well we saw him at the  the golf  the golf out  yeah the golf  you finally  you guys talked about that  day  yeah  pretty fucking funny  laughing his ass off  it's so weird when you  you're like  you know  that many years ago  something happens  you go through your life  and then you end up  like  in a radio career  both of you  it's fucking odd  really strange  and then I got like 
[02:59:00]  Adam Farrar  is another friend of mine  that ends up  you know  doing TV  very odd  Nurse Jackie now right  very odd  oh yeah  yeah Nurse Jackie  and he's still doing  Top Gear  and uh  yeah  very fucking weird  little circle of people  I have roamed with  over the years  but I probably did  start crying  when uh  when I punched  him in the head  anyone breaking their arm  is gonna fucking cry  I was using the  fucking prison strategy  we were talking about  you get the biggest guy  you gotta get that  first punch in  just slam him in the 
[02:59:30]  fucking head  I had this  fucking delusion  when the punch was  landing  cause everything is  in slow motion  when the punch is  landing I'm thinking  fuck  I'm gonna nail this guy  this is gonna be great  I'm gonna fucking  knock out  the biggest guy  in school  I'm gonna be the  shit  in front of your  house this happened  too  this is in the  school yard  oh he keeps saying  how he came out  of your house  he doesn't remember  in the school  believe me  I remember every  fucking detail  cause I was like  oh my god  I fucking got him  this is the shot  I'm gonna fucking  lay out Boomer Esiason 
[03:00:00]  and I'm gonna be  the guy that  knocked out Boomer  crackle  old graham cracker  fucking  I would imagine  that prison strategy  of hitting the  biggest guy  is the dumbest  thing you could  do in the end  exactly  who the fuck  is gonna go  oh wow  that was impressive  alright I guess  we'll leave him  alone  and I guess  the big huge  monster is gonna  now leave him  alone too  no  of course not  first of all  the big guy  is gonna go  well he's not  gonna surprise me  again  I'm gonna walk  up to him  and snap his  pencil neck  exactly  yeah  Dionne Warwick

[03:12:00]  And a terrible actor  And your chance to speak directly with him  Call 866-969-1969  The phone lines are open  And the Jim Norton Show  Starts now  I never get sick of that music  I don't care about the intro  Or the words  But I never get tired of this song 
[03:12:30]  We might get Jeffrey Tambor in  Closer to the Arrested Development  I would love to have Jeffrey Tambor in  Intro you gonna talk to him about that song?  That's all I'll talk to him about  That and Injustice for All  Oh yeah  Yeah  Hey do you still throw plates  Like you did in Injustice for All?  Hey do you have a wig  Like you did in Injustice for All?  Were you really sad  When Earl Soames  Killed two children  And you had to come tell  Arthur Kirkland about it  Because you got him off?  I could talk about Injustice for All 
[03:13:00]  For this entire hour  I know everything about it  Ask me fucking  John Forsythe's name  Judge Fleming  Great movie  Made me want to be a lawyer actually  In 1979  The music for it's terrible  There's terrible music  In Injustice for All  It's one of those films  That you remember  For the music being so bad  But Dominic Chinis is in that  He plays his client  Uncle Junior  Uncle Junior  He's in one of the opening scenes  In a car accident  I was obsessed with that movie  Because that scene at the end 
[03:13:30]  My name is Arthur Kirkland  And I'm you know  Craig T. Nelson I think  Is the other lawyer  And I wanted to be a lawyer  After seeing that  Because that was a performing thing  How'd that go?  Not well  Dropped out of high school  The old wrist slicing  The old suicide attempt  But that made me want to be an attorney  But I realized  It was not about the law  It was not about right and wrong  It was about that performance  That Pacino gave  It was about  He took his left hand  And he said  I rehearsed that so many times 
[03:14:00]  When I was a kid  The guilty are punished  And the innocent are freed  It was so fucking good  If you haven't seen  Injustice for All  Just fucking drown yourself  In a tub  Even if you have  Alright  Let's see here  Oh let's go to Sergio  Needs to lose weight  Sergio I'm with you  Jim  Big fan  Thank you buddy  I'm a big fat fuck  I can't stop eating  Of course  You said that when you said  I'm a big fan  I understand  Well there you go 
[03:14:30]  I get jealous of you  When I hear everybody complimenting you  Thank you  How do you do it Jim  What's the key  Help me out here bro  I just had a moment of clarity  When you quit drinking  And getting high  A lot of times they say  You're sick and tired  Of being sick and tired  And that's what happened with this  I just got sick and tired of it  And I had that moment  Where I'm like  I'm gonna fucking do something  And I started just going to the gym  And it was  Again it was  I know I'm not gonna see results 
[03:15:00]  For a while  I think you should prepare yourself  To not see results  For a while  Just make myself do it  Make yourself do it  And then realize  You will see results  Sooner or later  I joined a gym  I joined the gym  That Opie goes to  Because it got me  Out of my routine  And I just started going  And I started looking forward to it  And I just got  I was almost like  You know what  Fuck you  To myself  I got sick of it  And you have to be fed up with it  How much weight  Do you want to lose  Jim I don't know 
[03:15:30]  I'm a fat fuck  I can't even fuck  Well then what you got to do  Is dude be sick of that  And realize  That it's absolutely possible  The only difference  Between people who lose weight  And people who don't  Are the ones who lose weight  Want to  More  That's all it is  There's a willingness  To go and do something about it  But again  What I  Here's how we sabotage ourselves  Because I will like  I still have bad eating days  When I'm on the road  And shit 
[03:16:00]  I don't eat ice cream sundaes  But I'll eat shittier  Than I should  Or I'll have bread  When I know I shouldn't  Or I'll eat a fucking dessert  And then  Immediately the next day  I see myself as a pig  In the mirror  Because I have body image issues  I'm like  You fucking idiot  You fucked it up  So it's immediately  I can't go work out  Because I'm in the same old pattern  Like I immediately get back  Into that shitty mindset  The key is to just go  Don't listen to yourself  You're an idiot  Go  Go to the fucking gym  And then after I work out  Sometimes I'll look and go 
[03:16:30]  Oh my god  You got washboard abs  Even though I don't  But I see myself better  After the gym  So  Be sick and tired  Of where you are  Maybe try some  12 step meetings for it  OA  Helps a lot of people  And just begin doing the work  Dude  The weight will not  Come off by itself  But if you eat better  And you go to the gym  You absolutely  Will lose the weight  Thank you Jim  I'll try to call back  And check up with you  Okay  Yeah but do it  Because once you start  Getting compliments  It drives you 
[03:17:00]  To continue doing it  But just don't expect  Results in two days  Because that way  You won't discourage yourself  Just realize  It'll be a while  But make sure you do it man  You feel so much better  When you do  And dude  I'm buying clothes now  And then again  This is six months  Eight months  In the works  But I'm like  Hey I can buy this  Or I can not buy that  I have a choice  With clothing now  It's not just  Which hides my fucking  Tits the best  Wow thank you Jim  I appreciate it  Good looking out man  Okay good luck man  Make sure you  Make sure you do it too  Because it's possible  Alright  Alright buddy 
[03:17:30]  What's up  Kevin  Hi Kevin  Hey what's up Jim  How you doing  Well  I have an issue where  I've been in a relationship now  For a little while  And same thing seems to happen  Whenever I'm in a relationship  When I'm single  All I want to do  Is meet girls  And fuck obviously  And then once I  Once I'm in a relationship  Where I have the opportunity  To have sex  On a regular basis 
[03:18:00]  I can't stop  Fucking jerking off  And looking at porn  And it like  Definitely affects  The relationship  Because now  Like sometimes  I won't even be able  To fuck my girlfriend  Sure  I totally get it  There's a couple reasons  For that I think  And believe me man  I'm a victim of it  One of them is  Masturbation addiction  So I mean  That's a part of it  Another part is  Sometimes I like to chase  More than the catch  As they say  So I'm always going  For what I don't have  When I'm single  I want the girlfriend 
[03:18:30]  I jerk off  Or I fantasize  Lovingly about that  Or when I have the girlfriend  I jerk off  Thinking about other girls  And even if she's willing  To fuck other girls  Well then I jerk off  Thinking about her fucking guys  I always  I like to always look  One step ahead  Or one step out of my reach  And that's what I fantasize about  Plus being a fantasy addict  Is part of it  And are there things sexually  That you're not telling a girl  Like that you really desire  Or porn that you really want to watch  That you can't tell her about  Oh absolutely  Yeah 
[03:19:00]  That's part of the problem too  Is that  When you're fantasizing about things  You don't think your partner  Will enjoy with you  I suggest  Finding a partner  Who you can talk about  That stuff  Like with my ex-girlfriend  Unfortunately we fought too much  But I could tell her  Almost everything  I fantasized about sexually  So that really cut down on  And I'm still a porn addict  And I'm still jerking off  But it helped a lot  Because I would fuck her  While we watched certain porn  Or I'd go down on her  While she watched certain porn 
[03:19:30]  Or you know  We would incorporate it  Into our sex  Yeah  I mean it  It gets to the point  With me where  Like I have to  Kind of like plan  I feel like  Convince myself  Not to drop a load  Sure  Because you know  My girlfriend's  Going to be coming over  Later that night  And I need  You know  She's going to be pissed off  If I can't do it  Is she a good fuck?  I mean in all honesty  Us talking now  Not her  Is she a good fuck?  Is she what you want sexually?  She is  And she's very open minded  And like  You know  We've watched porn together 
[03:20:00]  And she is willing to try  Pretty much anything  Okay  It's too available  Yeah it's really hard dude  It's a very hard one  But again  You know back in the old days  They jerked off like we do too  They just didn't have the porn  So for them  They were much more fantasy  And that's probably why  Guys would go out  Peeping in windows  You know  I mean this problem  Has been around for centuries  My only suggestion  Would be  To just not jerk off  Like  But it's really hard to do  To  Like they say bridge  Like jerk off  And watch porn with her 
[03:20:30]  Like so you're bridging her  And the porn together  And then just start fucking  With her without the porn  But then again  If you bridge  You may just only be able  To fuck her with porn on  I would suggest  Stopping jerking off  For a little while  But it's really hard  Yeah I mean  It's just  What you said  I think it's an issue  Where you know  There's something bigger  Where you're just never  Going to be content  With what you have  Right in front of you  Yeah it's a big part of it  Is I always fantasize  About what I don't have  Because I'm in a place now  Where  I could have a girlfriend  And I can't afford 
[03:21:00]  Prostitutes  But I prefer to get a massage  Where I don't know  What's going to happen  Like  No matter what  I have  I want something else  That's what it comes down to  So maybe that flaw  In yourself  Work on  Because that's what  I try to do myself  Fix that flaw  That says you're never  Happy with what you have  The old expression  My friend Brush used to say  God if I can't have  What I want  Please let me want  What I have  And it's one of the  Most valuable lessons  I ever learned  And ignore  Well I appreciate the advice  Jim  Thank you  Good luck my friend  You were great  You were great in the woodsman 
[03:21:30]  Thank you  Thank you very much  Alright let's see here  How about  Bob in Texas  Jimmy  Hey Bob  How are you  Hey  Jimmy  I know you've got  A lot of experience  With this  Basically  A couple weeks ago  A buddy of mine  Gave me four of those  About 20 milligram  Whatever they are  Cialis  Okay  So you know how it works  You pop one  And that's  You know  An hour later  Nothing's happened  You end up popping 
[03:22:00]  Another one  Nothing's happened  And I ended up  Taking all four of them  Go on a marathon  Fuck session  It was at least  20-30 minutes  Which is a marathon  For me  But anyway  After we get done  It felt like  My heart was fixing  To explode  Of course it did  I'm surprised you  Fucking  You're alive  You took four  20 milligram  Cialis  Yeah  It was like  Yeah  You know  In the little  Yellow looking  Football thing  Yes I know  Exactly what they are  They're like teardrops  How long were you  Honestly 
[03:22:30]  Realistically  How long were you  Waiting  In between each one  Probably  30 minutes  Between the first two  Maybe another  15-20 minutes  Yes  And I popped  The other two  All together  Yeah it's crazy  Here's what you do  What I found  Is with Cialis  It does not work  For me  In an hour  The way Viagra does  So when I'm  Going to use  If I need Cialis  Like to fuck a girl  Like say if I'm  Going to see a girl  At 8  Take Cialis  At 5 or 5.30  Or 6  And give it time 
[03:23:00]  To go into my system  And again  I don't know  If this is psychological  Or not  But it seems like  Cialis  Goes through me  Slower than Viagra does  Never keep taking them  No dude  Like honestly  You're better off  Just not having a rod  Because that's really  Bad for you  And I would never  Do that  And I've taken a lot  I've never taken  More than one pill  Viagra I think  Works better  In an instant  So if you're  Going to see a girl  In an hour  I would try a Viagra  But if you have time 
[03:23:30]  Dude you know  You're going to see a girl  Take the 20 milligrams  Which I believe  And again  Check with the doctor  But I think  20 milligram  Levitra or Cialis  Is equal to  100 milligram Viagra  Which is the strongest  So  What you did  I think was dangerous  And you're lucky  I would  Again  I would have a check  Go talk to a doctor  About that  Make sure you're good  But never do that again  Take one  And just give it  Some more time to work  And you do have to  Be turned on  For these to work  Like you can't  Just take a Viagra  Or a Cialis 
[03:24:00]  And  You know  I personally can't  And all of a sudden  Hey my dick is hard  Regardless  Like I have to  Still have a mental  Process which turns me on  I think a big thing  That what it does  Is it helps physically  But I also think  Mentally it gives me  A certain confidence  So my dick works  You know  But you still have  To be turned on  So  Yeah well I mean  I was on a drive  You know  Three hours to go  Over and see this chick  So it's like  I figured hey  By the time I get there  Everything will be going  Rocking and rolling 
[03:24:30]  So  I figured you know  About an hour out  I'd start taking them  And you know  Nothing happens  So you know how that works  Sure I've had that too  But don't  Don't just don't  You got lucky this time  I would never take multiples again  Holy shit  Alright thank you Jimmy  Be good buddy  Good luck  Fucking maniac  Let's see  Oh wait  Where is  Dicka dicka dicka dicka  Sorry  Charlie  Wow it's heavy  This is very heavy  Hi Jim  Hi Charlie  Alright I'm going to 
[03:25:00]  Read it to you  Your wife  Her name  Has been having  An affair with  The electrician  His name  From the town of  Blank blank  For years and years  Wake up  Figure it out  Watch your wife  Wow  Yeah I opened it up  Right in front of her  I almost started laughing  And then I just said  Well wait a minute  I don't want to  Start anything  Because we were about  To go on vacation  So I just kind of like  Put her off to the side  And we're back  And I'm pretty sure  I'm going to say  You know 
[03:25:30]  This is what I got  What's up  Well first of all  Hey you're a guy  Who can really  Brush something aside  Did you enjoy the vacation  Yeah pretty much  You know  Had a good time  Now the  Okay do you know  The electrician  He came over  To the house  One time  You know  To try and help  Figure something out  Years ago  But I barely  Even remember him  Okay so they may  Have met then  Or they did meet then  So this letter  Could be  A. Someone that hates you  B. Someone that hates your wife 
[03:26:00]  Or C. The wife  Or best friend  Of the electrician  Because what  Who else would know  About their relationship  Or having met them  Who else would know  That he was at your house  And even knows your wife  Well I don't think  It has to do with anything  With the house  Thing you know  It's their  You know they work  For a township  Everybody knows everybody  It's not a real big town  Oh okay  You go out drinking  Every now and then  And partying  And you know  Every other Friday  Or something like that  But you know  I know about it  She always you know  Calls and says  Hey I'm going out  And then you know  I almost laughed 
[03:26:30]  When I saw it  Because I was just like  You know forget it  No way this is  Like I said  You know somebody's  Really pissed at you  Look what they sent me  Did your  What did your gut tell you  Did you believe it or not  Absolutely not  Oh you really don't  I still pretty much don't  But you know  I held off  Like it's been  Three or four weeks  And it's like you know  Well I'm going to stay late  And do some things here  And then you know  I'm going to the gym  Which you know  She does a lot  I don't know that's true  But you know  I just never really  Even thought about it  And it's just like  Well there are  There are some opportunities 
[03:27:00]  Here where she  Sure  Do you guys still  Have a lot of sex  We've been married  30 years  Oh okay  Has her behavior changed  You know  Like is there a part  What part of you  Did believe it  Probably just hold it off  And then just  You know  Dwelling on it  A little bit  I guess talk to her  Of course she's going  To deny it  I don't think  Have you checked  The phone bill  No  Well you might want  To check the phone bill  And see if there's  Any weird calls 
[03:27:30]  I mean I don't think  That that's snooping  If you're checking  The phone bill  I wouldn't say  Check her phone  But you might want  To check the phone bill  And just see if there's  Any weird calls going out  She may be smart enough  To avoid that  But if she knows  You don't check the phone bill  Maybe she's gotten comfortable  And is calling  This guy's number  Yeah  Well I think if she did that  She'd probably do it  On her own phone  Oh right  Cell phone  Okay  Yeah  So yeah  We don't go into  Each other's phones  And stuff like that  Well you know  We're kind of  You know  What would you do  If it's true  What are you going to do  If it's true  Well I don't know 
[03:28:00]  I might do  Something on my own  Then  That's why  I'm like  Jesus may open up  The door  Because I've had  A few opportunities  And I've had  A couple of  You know  People that I work with  You know  Yeah I wouldn't mind  You know  Jumping in the sack  With her  Are you secretly  Hoping it's true  You know  Maybe  But you're not  Going to commit suicide  Or do anything crazy  No  No  I'm just  You know  Hey  If you really like this guy  You know  If you want to go with him  Which I don't think is the case 
[03:28:30]  But you know  I'll just lay it all out there  Hey  If you want to go with him  Go ahead  You know  I'll find somebody else  Yeah I guess you have to mention the letter  I guess you have to  Where you should  Instead of mentioning the letter  You might want to say  Because you don't want to tip your hand  As to how you have the information  Don't say I got an anonymous letter  Because then she'll go  I can argue that  But you ought to say  I would like  Maybe you sit down and go  Listen we need to talk  See how she reacts  Really judge her reaction  Before you say anything  And then go  I want to 
[03:29:00]  I want to  What are you going to tell me  About this electrician  Or what can you tell me  About what's going on  What's going on  With this electrician  I want to see how honest  You're going to be  Like this way  She might not know  If you've had her followed  She won't know  If you saw a text  She won't know  That if you've just  Stumbled it  So you might not want to  Tell her how you know  What you know  So then she kind of thinks  Well maybe he doesn't  He knows everything  So see what she confesses  Oh that's a good idea  Yeah  I would  I would just do it slower 
[03:29:30]  Because if you go  You know I got this letter  And you let her look at it  Immediately if she's doing it  She goes  Okay there's nothing factual in here  I'm caught  But there's nothing here  That proves it  So you might want to  Approach it  With the attitude  That you've got  Definitive proof  You're a genius Jim  Alright good luck man  No I've just been sneaky  So I know  I know it would trip me up  That's what would do it  Alright good luck man  I hope  In a way I hope she's not  And for your own sake  I hope she is  So either way  You win my friend  Thank you  Alright  And how about 
[03:30:00]  Oh Seth  Seth up in Rochester  I get it  Hey Jimmy  Hi buddy  Hey big fan  Thank you so much  Quick question  I've been having  I've been  Well I'll give you a little  Quick background  I've been married  For about 13 years now  Wife is a very attractive one  Sex has always been great  And but over the last  Five years or so  I've always kind of  I've kind of developed 
[03:30:30]  This urge to have  A threesome with her  With another guy  It's kind of a turn on  For me thinking of her  You know  I guess the thing with me  Is just not  I'm not a bi  Or anything like that  I'm completely straight  It would just be  For additional pleasure  For her  And it's  You know  I've told her  About the fantasy  And everything  And at first  She was kind of  Taken aback by it  But it seems like  She's kind of  Warmed the idea  A little bit lately  Because like  If we'll be out  At a bar or something 
[03:31:00]  Like she'll point  Like for instance  We went out  For a Valentine's Day dinner  And while we were out  You know  We had a couple drinks  At the bar after  And she pointed out  She said  That guy's hot  And you know  It's even  I got her to  Flash a guy  One time  When we were driving  But you know  It's just kind of  There now  It's just kind of  Stagnated  And I guess  I'm wondering  You know  What's the next step  To actually  Seriously  You know  Pursue it  I guess  And I'm not 
[03:31:30]  The jealous type  Or anything at all  So it's not like  I think the issue  More is  Her thinking  Well is he going  To be okay  With it afterwards  Well we've  We've discussed  This before  On this show  Because I've had  A little experience  In this area  And one thing  To be  There's a couple  Things to be careful  Of  One you don't  Bring a maniac  Home who gets  Attracted to your  Wife and wants  A stalker  So I would  Definitely suggest  To hotel  The first time  Make sure  You're doing it  For the right reasons  Like because  Sometimes a fantasy  Is a fantasy  And it's sexy  Other times 
[03:32:00]  Because some people  Just like to swing  And that's cool  And other times  If I get bored  I begin to feel numb  And then my fantasies  Get crazy  Because I just want  To feel something  Like if I'm bored  With a person  Sometimes I'll start  To think about  Them fucking  A guy  Or them eating pussy  Or anything  So I can feel something  Make sure you're not  Doing it  Just to  Just to thaw out  Numbness  But if it's  For the right reasons  And you think it's hot  Why don't you guys  Take out an ad  On Craigslist  And communicate  Safely with a few guys 
[03:32:30]  Walk through this process  Where she's talking  To guys  While you fuck her  While you go down on her  And see if it's still  A turn on  Then maybe arrange  To meet  But like  You know  Go into the water  Slowly  So you can both  Back out at any time  Without having done  The unretractable  Right yeah  And it's definitely  Not for the wrong reasons  Okay  It's not  It's not on board  Or anything  I mean  You know  We have a great  Relationship  It's probably  Strongest it's ever been  All right  So but  Yeah I guess  You know 
[03:33:00]  And the other thing  Was you know  Is it  You know  Would it be better  With somebody  You know  Or a stranger  Or you know  Things like that  I personally  I personally think  It would be better  With a stranger  Because if there is  Awkwardness  Yes  You know  Going forward  Then how's it  Going to be  So  Yeah talk to him  A little bit  Get to know him  So your wife  Will be safe  But I would say  Never with a friend  Believe me  You ever fucking hear  Operator by Jim Croce  Fucking shit goes to LA  With his best old ex friend  Ray  Come on  Wake up  It happens  Enjoy yourself  All right  Thanks Jimmy  Take care 
[03:33:30]  All right  Let's  We gotta address this guy  Here  Sleep with my best friend's ex  Come on  Oh the ex  I didn't read that  Chris in Louisiana  And we have a military guy next  All right  Chris in Louisiana  Yes  Hey Jimmy  How are you  Good how are you  Good buddy  How long did your friend  Date this girl  A couple of months  How long ago  A couple of months  Okay  So what happened  And what is your  Do you feel bad about it  Yeah  Kinda  Just 
[03:34:00]  I mean  The sex is amazing  And  There's a little  Nagging guilt  Well did he like this girl  And did she really hurt him  Uh  Did she hurt him  No  Meaning did she break up with him  And leave him  And he's like  Fuck I really like her  Or was she just a chick  He was banging  No no nothing like that  No no  Then what are you guilty about  Uh  Just because  I haven't told him about it  Is part of the thrill  That you thought she was hot  While he was fucking her 
[03:34:30]  And now all of a sudden  You have her  No  No  That's not it at all  It's just  It  I mean  It wasn't supposed to happen  It just kinda happened  Like most  Things  But uh  I mean the sex was good  So we continued having it  And now  How long  Have you been going with this girl  Uh  A week maybe  Yeah  I  It's  That's a very tricky  Area  Because I don't believe  Like you never wanna fuck a friend's  Ex-girlfriend 
[03:35:00]  Even if it's tempting  Uh  You try not to do that  But they only dated for two months  Um  And that's not like a long term relationship  Where they were in love  Right  Did he have  Did he have dibs on her forever though  Like  No no no  I mean but again  For me that's the rule with my friends  Because  I'll tell you why  It's a good rule to have with your friends  Because this way  While you guys are hanging out  You know  If like  My friend knows  I'm never gonna try to fuck his ex-girlfriend  Or his ex-wife  I'm not gonna start pitting  My friend against his girl 
[03:35:30]  Just so they break up  And I can fuck her  Uh  You gotta watch all that sneaky  Uh  Dirty motive shit  Like  If my friend and I have that arrangement  Like  You know  Uh  I know the  Guys I know  Like  Believe it or not  Even Keith Robinson  Who is a piece of shit  And Bob Kelly  Even if Bobby was single  I believe these guys  Would not fuck my exes  Um  They wouldn't do it  And Patrice wouldn't have done it  And Patrice was a complete pervert  So  I was always comfortable  With those guys  Being around my girls 
[03:36:00]  If I didn't have that arrangement  I would never trust their motives  Because as men  We're creeps  So does he have dibs on her forever  No  But obviously  You have a problem with it  So what  Why do you feel guilty  If you don't think that he'll care  Uh  Because I  I guess  This is the first time  I've really broke that  That code  Oh okay  How long have you been friends  With the guy  Uh  Since high school  Alright so he  Is he more important to you  Than her  That's a good question 
[03:36:30]  Who do you  Yeah probably  How do you think he'd react  In all honesty  Not how do you want him to react  How do you think he'll react  Uh  Knowing him  Probably not well  So you don't think he'll like it  Well I mean  I plan on telling him  But he's  He's gone to work right now  Alright  I'm part of  Some people would say  It's none of his business  But you might have to  Because  If he sees you out with her  Or he hears about it  It's better he hears about it  From you  Real fall down  What's that 
[03:37:00]  Real fall down  Oh okay  So somebody could see you guys out  Well if you're gonna keep seeing her  You might wanna tell him  Just to get any awkwardness  Out of the way  And this way you don't have to hide it  And he doesn't have to stumble on it  And go why  Cause then he would go  Why the fuck didn't you just tell me dude  Cause then it feels sneaky  Right  That's what I don't want it to feel like  Yeah  I would just  You know I guess if you have to tell him  I would just say get it over with  Yeah  Good luck  Good advice  Yeah that's all I can suggest man  It's a rough one  Good advice man  Thanks  Love the show 
[03:37:30]  Bye bye  Brian we're gonna get to you in a minute  But I wanna talk to Joe first  From Pittsburgh in the military  Hi Joe  Hi Jim  How you doing man  Good thank you sir  I just wanna say first  You're a huge inspiration of mine  Last time I was overseas  I listened to your comedy  Oh thank you  And you're one of the reasons  Why I started doing  Open mics and stuff like that  Oh good luck my friend  Good luck  But my question is  Next year my contract's running up  In the army  And I'm gonna have 14 years in  I'm gonna be 34 in a month 
[03:38:00]  And I'm just  I'm tired of doing what I do now  Sure  I mean I've had a good decorated  You know career  Right  And I just  I just  I just wanna walk away  I wanna work in broadcasting  I wanna work in radio  And also do some  Some film work  And I just  I'm really hesitant  About walking away  From a career  That I've worked  Sure  Almost 14 years on  Is there any way  You can do both  Like is there any way  You can stay with the safe job  While pursuing the other  And getting kind of  A leg in the door 
[03:38:30]  I have  The last couple years  I've done online radio  For about the last  Three years  And I've had some actually  Some pretty high profile guests  And I  I guess in that small little niche  I've had some success  Okay  In terms of guests  You know  Just different aspects  I've had people from  Westboro Baptist Church  UFC guys  Athletes  Politicians  Sorry  So you've had like  A good run of interviews  Yeah  And I've tasted  That bit of success  In my own small little world 
[03:39:00]  Sure  And I just  I wanna capitalize on  I mean  I've gone so far now  Is  You know  I've got all this  You know  Expensive  Podcasting equipment  In my basement  And I've just bought  A green screen  And a camera  And studio lighting  I just  I'm doing what I can now  But I know  That it's just  While I'm in the army  It's just gonna be a hobby  And I  I don't wanna do that  I just  I wanna chase  You know  Your dream  So I think you've answered  Your own question  Then you finished  The military honorably 
[03:39:30]  And  You did that  You know you're good at that  And now you're ready  For another part of your life  And if it's not broadcasting  It'll be something else  But you're sick of the military  So that should tell you  Right then  That it's okay to move on  So  I would suggest  Pursuing your dream  The fear I have though  I'm a single dad  And  Okay  You know  The income  The shit income  That I make  Is  Just fine for myself  And my daughter now  But  It's like  Right  You know  I go to school  I don't wanna just try  To get a job in radio 
[03:40:00]  I wanna go to school  And  You know  I guess  Do it the right way  But it's just like  If I fail  Then  What am I gonna have  For myself  And my daughter  You know  That's a very big question  And again  I'm not in that position  So I can't speak  From experience  I always suggest  Following the dreams  But if you have a daughter  You have to be responsible  To your daughter too  Maybe have another  Full time job  To step into  Which is more conducive  With doing radio  So again  If the military  Makes it too hard  But you have to  Make sure you can  Make a living too  Cause you're not  18 with no kids  So you can't just  Run out and go

[03:43:00]  And are you involved  With her physically  Sexually  No no  Okay  It doesn't involve that  So what's the  What's the scenario  In a nutshell here  Well since she was  Probably about  15 or so  I've been like her  Person she's looked up to  And she's talked to  About everything  Cause you know  She's from  A divorce  And everything  And her dad's  Not in the picture  All that much  And her mom  Tried to keep her  Pretty well sheltered  And she always  Came to me 
[03:43:30]  For advice  About everything  And after so many  Years you know  She's always said  You know  If you weren't  You know my uncle  And all this kind of jazz  You know I'm like  Oh you know  Keep that under your hat  You know I don't want  I don't want to hear  That kind of stuff  And as she got older  You know the less  The less I started  Caring and you know  And all that  And then I don't know  I just developed  Into a crush  And went from there  See things  Somebody says  When they're 15  And they look up to you 
[03:44:00]  As a responsible  Adult male  Especially when they have  Like she may see you  As stable  Personally I would suggest  To absolutely not do it  Even though I know  It's tempting to  Believe me  I have a cock  And I understand  That your cock  Doesn't care  But I think  It sounds to me  Like it would be  Hurting her  And you know  She's young man  She's 22  When she's  You know again  Girls say things  When they're 16  Like oh my god  I have such a crush  On you  You're my uncle  Or whatever  But you gotta kind of  Leave that alone  Cause she's gonna 
[03:44:30]  Find a guy  And she's gonna  Move on with her life  And be happy  You don't wanna  Fucking taint that  You know  You don't wanna  Fucking  Your family would  Hate you for that dude  Oh definitely  Definitely  You know  I  You know  We've talked about it  You know  We've  You know  We've  Done like  Texting and all that stuff  And at first  It was weird  Then it got  You know  Too comfortable  Then  We  Then we  We shut it down  And then  She's always like  Here and there  She'll shoot me a text 
[03:45:00]  And I'm like  Want to ignore it  But it's hard  What kind of text  Does she shoot you?  Oh just  You know  Just like  You know  Like  Well especially at night  It gets pretty bad  She goes like  You know  My  Pussy's humming  With excitement  Wanting you to lick it  And all kinds of shit  Oh it's really dirty  You gotta stop that dude  You gotta stop  It's only going to end  Badly  She's your niece  That's a  That's a violating thing  Even though again 
[03:45:30]  I understand the temptation  I'm not judging you  But she's your niece man  She's your brother's  Or sister's kid  Sisters  Yeah don't do it man  It's fucking  You're 35  She's 22  You know what I mean  That's a fucking  Was it a 13 year difference  Like  You know  You were 15 years old  She was 2  And I know it's legal  And I'm not saying  That you're gonna go to jail for it  But it's only gonna hurt  The family badly  Realize that you just  Is she prettier  Than a girl you'd normally get  And maybe she pays attention to you 
[03:46:00]  Because you're her uncle  And your family  That might  Yeah yeah  That might be the case  She's definitely  Prettier than any girl  You know  That I've been with  Yeah she's a fantasy girl to you  Because all of a sudden  Here this young  Pretty girl  Is treating you  The way you want  Pretty young girls  To treat you  And the reason  She's so comfortable with you  And treating you  With so much love  Is probably because  You're safe  You're her uncle  So for as like  Twisted as the reasons  As you're thinking  You should probably fuck her are  That's her reasons 
[03:46:30]  For saying this stuff to you  Because in fairness  She probably shouldn't  Be saying this stuff  To a 35 year old guy  Who's not as good looking  As a guy she could get  She should probably be saying this  To a 25 year old guy  Or you know what I mean  So her reasons  For wanting to fuck you  Are probably just as twisted  As your reasons  For wanting to fuck her  And I get it  But I would suggest  Not doing it  I agree  Yeah I totally understand that  But she  You know  She throws that candy 
[03:47:00]  In front of me  Like you know  That she's a virgin  So that drives me  Up the wall pretty well  Oh okay  See that would do nothing for me  So again you're safe  She's not even fucking guys yet  At 22  What does that tell you  That's true  Let her fuck  You don't want her first fuck  To be her uncle  You think  You think she's a little  Messed up now  Come on man  You can't  You cannot  Let her first fuck  Be her uncle  I agree  Can't do it  You know  You gotta let it go  Just jerk off  Into a napkin  And go find somebody  You know  Are you single  Yeah 
[03:47:30]  Yeah of course  I understand the temptation  But don't do it  Just realize that  It would feel good  In the moment  But there's way  Way too many negatives  To it  It would hurt her badly  A lot of baggage right  Dude  It's a nightmare  And it will end badly  Guaranteed  Alright  Alright  Thanks Jimmy  I appreciate it buddy  Good luck  Okay  How about  See  How about  Mike  Mike  In New Jersey  Hey Jimmy 
[03:48:00]  Happy birthday buddy  Thank you Mike  My brother  Was in a long term  Relationship  And it kind of  Ended badly  He went down  To Venezuela  He met a girl  Stayed with her  For a week  And now he's  Getting married  This summer  Well  At least he didn't  Rush it  Jesus  So what is your thing  How do you talk  Him out of it  You know  I don't want to  Talk him out of it  It just seems that  The rest of the family  Is like so on board  With it 
[03:48:30]  They're very supportive  Of it  Why do they think  He was gay  For a long time  No no no  He's definitely not gay  Definitely not gay  He's the  You know  About as straight  As they can come  But you know  I feel like a little weird  Because I think  I'm the only one  That's like  Hey you know  Take it easy  Slow down  I mean I know  What a lot of  These South American  Even Russian  Russian brides  You know  What they can do  What are your thoughts  Should I say something  To him  Or should I just  Kind of  Sit back  And let it happen  Well maybe you can 
[03:49:00]  Say something  Without accusing him  You could ask him  Like hey man  You know  Sometimes these things  Work out  Are you sure  This is the right thing  And you know  Do you guys  Just ask him  He may go  Look this is one  Of those things  I think Nick Cannon  And Mariah Carey  Got married  After dating  For six weeks  Or whatever  Even though they  Knew each other  So sometimes  People get married  In weird circumstances  And it works  So you can't tell  Someone not to do it  If he's an adult  And he's intelligent  Maybe you could  Just ask him  About it  And say look  Of course dude  I have to ask you  Because you're my brother 
[03:49:30]  And it's only a week  Are you sure  This is the right thing  And he may go  I'm 100% sure  Then you just  Gotta let him do it  And then you know  Just try to catch  Peaks at her ass  In a bikini  And jerk off  Nice  Thanks Jimmy  Alright man  We've got great advice buddy  Yeah yeah yeah  Make sure you jerk off  Angrily  Angrily while grunting  Her name  And we're  Marty in Delaware  Whose wife  Is a drug addict  Hey Jim  How you doing man  Hi Marty  Hey  I'm trying to make  This short and sweet  Because there's a lot  Of people involved 
[03:50:00]  My wife  And she has  Two brothers  And sisters  All of them  Have alcohol  Pill use  And other narcotics  Throughout their life  Okay  How long have you been with her?  I'm sorry to interrupt you  How long have you been with her?  About nine years  Okay  Alright  The whole family's cool  My wife  And my brother-in-law  Are about  Give or take  A month or so apart  Been clean  For about a year plus  Her other sister 
[03:50:30]  Does it recreationally  More  More drinking  And pot  What about her?  They don't matter  It's obviously  In the family  Well  The reason why  I'm saying all this  Because all of them  Has done it  And my wife is pregnant  And I wasn't sure  If  If those five  Had done it  Do you think  My son  Well  I will be having a son  You'll never know  There's no way to tell  He probably  When you're born into that  A lot of times  You do have a predisposition  For addiction  But you're never gonna know 
[03:51:00]  If he gets it from her  Sometimes it does  Skip a generation  You don't know  My dad's an alcoholic  I'm an alcoholic  His father's an alcoholic  But again  My kid  If I ever have one  May not be  There's no way to tell  But is she doing drugs  While she's pregnant?  No, no, no, no  Okay  Oh, I'm sorry  Wait, she's sober?  My wife and my brother-in-law  Are clean  I'm sorry  I misunderstood  The other ones  Have done it  Unfortunately  Maybe more than  Weekend Warriors  And the other ones  Maybe like a recreational 
[03:51:30]  But I'm just  I'm just more worried  If  Oh, I'm sorry  Yeah, okay  I'm just worried about my itch  I'm just worried about my son  He'd have that itch  Okay  A lot of years down the road  Yeah, yeah  I apologize, dude  You know what?  I wouldn't worry about that  Because like, you know, literally  First of all  You never know  It's physical  They say it's a physical  Mental, spiritual thing  I think that conditions  Contribute  Not what goes on outside you  But how you respond to conditions  So  What does his personality make up? 
[03:52:00]  Is he obsessive?  Is he compulsive?  Does he learn how to say no?  All of these things you won't know  Until he's growing  And getting a little older  You know  Is he  It depends on who he hangs out with sometimes  Like, you know  If you're hanging out with a bunch of people  Who are doing dope  You're probably going to try it  If, you know  That's why Bill Gates  Was not hanging out with guys  Who fucking did lines of coke  You know  He probably hung out with nerdy guys  So  Your kids' friends will all  You know  His group of friends will matter  But there's no way to tell 
[03:52:30]  I'm babbling  There's no way to tell  Trust me  I do the same thing  No, listen  I know  If anybody  Comes up to you  And says  Yo, here's coke  They're going to do it or not do it  But I wasn't sure  If  If maybe a recreational  Might trigger something  And he's  He's all in  Yeah, it could  It absolutely could  That's the predisposition  So you have to do your best  To teach him  To stay away from it  That's all you can do  Is make sure that he knows  How bad it is  Yeah, my wife said  She's going to be all in 
[03:53:00]  With saying  Hey  I've been  I'm through it  Your uncle's through it  Try not to do it  But I mean  Listen  I know it's all  All into the introduction  But I'm just  I'm just worried about  Everybody  Everybody  Can be responsible  Drinkers  Sure  I mean  I am too  I know I've got to go to work  The next day  Or the following day  And blah blah blah  But I'm just worried about  If that one sip  Might lead to alcohol  Yeah  Or one puff  Could lead to  Sure 
[03:53:30]  Whatever down the line  Alright, well good luck  You won't know for years and years  But hopefully  You'll be right  But it's good that you're thinking of it  And just  You know  Just drill it into his head  Like the minute he comes out of the womb  Just scream at him  Don't you ever pick up a fucking drink  In my house  That's the way to do it  And he'll remember that  Alright  Yeah, it's my drink  That's why  Good luck, buddy  Hey, Jimmy  Thanks a lot, man  I appreciate it  And one quick thing  That epic show you did last year  Is that going to be on Comedy Central soon?  Yes, I think this month  Who knows  I'm doing another one tomorrow  I mean this Friday  So look forward to it  With the fucking production company 
[03:54:00]  Alright  We gotta wrap up  Thank you, buddy  Okay  Wow  Mark in Colorado  Hey, Jimmy  Alright  Your wife had an affair two years ago  Correct  How long have you been married  And who did she have the affair with?  We've been married 17 years  Okay  And her boss  Who was old enough to be her father  Does she still work with him?  No, no  I don't believe there's any contact anymore from them  So, I mean  I can't find everything out 
[03:54:30]  But  Had you ever had an affair?  Had you ever had one?  A first year of marriage  I had a one-night stand  And that's it  So how long did she have the affair for?  Two and a half years  Oh, I'm sorry  You said that  So she was deceiving  She had the affair for two and a half years  Right, okay  It's been two years since  Okay  So you said she still has keepsakes  What do you mean?  He gave her  He gave her endless things  From jewelry to everything else  The thing that I found  She keeps in her purse 
[03:55:00]  It's actually foreign currency  From one of the countries she visited  And I actually wrote a letter  A little note on there  When I found it  Not even looking for it  I was bouncing a checkbook  And came across it  Sure  And found this thing  I actually wrote a post-it note on there  I said, why would you keep this?  And put it back  And then about a week later  I went back to see where it was  And it wasn't there anymore  And I'm thinking, well, great  She got rid of it  It didn't mean anything  However, I found it again  In a different place  See, how would you  Like, I don't understand people 
[03:55:30]  That are in relationships  And don't discuss this stuff  How would you not immediately say to her  What the fuck are you doing  Keeping this stuff  From a guy you were fucking  While we were married?  Well  What's her response to keep?  This is obviously not the first one  How many things have you found  And what discussions have you had about it?  All the other things that I found  First of all, she said  They were just two separate things  His relationship and my relationship  But it was just two  It didn't  Neither one of them ever crossed over  So she didn't think anything of it 
[03:56:00]  What?  The other part  Yeah, exactly  However, I didn't know  Still, I don't understand  Why she wouldn't just throw these things away  Because she's selfish  That's why  She's fucking selfish  Why would you stay with her?  I'm really annoyed  Why would you  If that's her answer  Instead of I fucked up badly  You're right  She's going  They were two separate things  While you were married  She was out fucking this guy?  Correct  So why would you  Not allow her  But you should say to her  If you're keeping this shit 
[03:56:30]  I'm done  Yeah  How did she get caught  In the relationship?  How did she get caught?  I stumbled across  Some text messages  Which started everything  And then  I severely  Investigated  I've got  Endless  Okay, so  Yeah  I know  There is no  There is no doubting  I have recordings  No, no, no  But I mean  So she didn't just end it  You caught her  And made her end it  Correct  And she kept stuff  One of the biggest questions 
[03:57:00]  Is that I said  If I hadn't caught you  Would you be with him?  Or  If we hadn't decided  To stay together  Because we have two children  Who  Deserve better than  Our actions towards each other  I feel I'm a better father  Than I have a husband  But  I feel that the children  Deserve better than what  Absolutely  Are you sure  She's not fucking him, dude?  How do you know?  Well, we live in a different state now  So  You moved her away from him?  Correct  Wow, okay  And  We moved 
[03:57:30]  It just all happened  At the same time  Okay, she's obviously  Moving was inevitable  We were doing that anyways  Oh, okay  Maybe she's still into him then  Or maybe  That's my question  How do I know  That she is over him  Or  Does she still want  This secret fantasy?  That was more of the enticement  It wasn't about the man  She said  It was more about  Having someone who  Was  Only cared about her  And not everything else  And  That was her biggest  That was her biggest  Enticement of the relationship  Was that  It was something  Secretive on the side 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, I know  I understand  But now that it's over  And she's caught  By her husband  And then you find  Keepsakes  And she knows  It hurts you  And her response is  That was a separate  Thing from you  Is a shitty  Unsatisfactory response  Well, I haven't  Confronted her  About the one  About the  Most recent one  Because  I just know  That she knows  I know about it  And hasn't brought it up  And then moved it  Somewhere else  Instead of just  Throwing it away  Yeah, I would talk to her  About it and go 
[03:58:30]  Look  I'm fucking  This is gonna end  I'm sick of it  Get  What exactly is going on  In your mind  And make her tell you  No, nothing  Nothing  Bullshit  Nothing  You're gonna have to  Sit and talk with her  And you gotta be firm, dude  You have every right  To say  I don't want you  Keeping shit  That this guy  Gave you  That he was fucking  You while we were married  And when you're still married  If that was a prior boyfriend  Who had died  In a fucking fire  Or, you know  He's a Chinese bus driver  Who had a fucking  Lamp posts fall through the window 
[03:59:00]  And kill him  That's different  You know what I mean  If she was married  To a guy who was killed  On 9-11  That's keepsakes  That she should keep  But this is different  I would make her  Get rid of that shit  And, you know  If she wants to keep  But then maybe  She should just move back  And start fucking the guy again  There you go  But then again  You got two kids  You can't just be that harsh  That's easy for me to say  That's the hardest part  Is that  I just  It's a fight  That doesn't  And my kids are old enough  Where I can just  It's more selfish  On my part to say  Wait until the kids are gone 
[03:59:30]  And then  Blow it up  But  That's  To answer my question  I know what I gotta do  It's just  Making a tough choice  Yep  Sit and talk to her  Make sure  Get it out  And then maybe  Find something that you guys can do  Which will make the relationship  Feel fresh again  Because I know that  Women go through that  Men go through that too  Where you're just bored  With the same person  You don't feel like  They're into you anymore  So maybe things  Not that it's your fault  She cheated  But maybe there's things  You ought to do better too  So don't forget  Maybe you're not  Eating her pussy enough  Maybe you're not  Turning her on enough  Or making her feel sexy  So maybe do some of those things 
[04:00:00]  And she'll get what  She needs from you  True  Very true  You know  Thank you man  Good luck  That's a rough one  You know  Obviously  There's problems in his bedroom  And you know  You know what dude  Here's my  Forget what I said  Adam and Eve  I'm just gonna go  They used to be a sponsor  They're determined to help you  Spice things up in the bedroom  From what I remember  From when they were sponsors  And you know  I think Adam and Eve  Would back up that promise even  I mean  But didn't we used to say  Fucking go to  AdamandEve.com  And get 50% off
