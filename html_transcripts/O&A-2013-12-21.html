<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a prank call segment featuring "Lady Di," whose number was leaked online. Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts bombard her with increasingly absurd and offensive questions, resulting in a humorous compilation of her surprisingly honest and gullible answers detailing unusual aspects of her life.  Studio guest Mike Bicchetti then joins, participating in a "top five" game featuring profane words and unconventional topics.  A heated argument erupts between producers Sal and Travis, fueled by offensive language and accusations of laziness and shirking responsibilities, specifically regarding the Lady Di segment preparation.  The argument involves numerous interruptions, escalating volume, and references to previous conflicts, with other staff, including Jim and Anthony, participating.  The discussion veers into passive-aggressive apologies and  references to *Star Trek*.

The conflict continues with studio guests Lady Di, Colin Quinn, and DJ Dennis Falcone present. A phone call with Marion, Lady Di's partner, adds to the chaos, involving insults and descriptions of a car accident.  Another caller, Sandy Cain, contributes to the heated exchange, referencing past lawsuits.  The argument continues, punctuated by commercial breaks. The show then features a "Worst of the Week" countdown, involving recurring guests Marion, Lady Di, Sandy Kane, and Bob Levy, along with Jim Florentine promoting his podcast. This segment includes multiple phone calls, crude language, sexually explicit content, and a prank call where Lady Di believes she’s speaking to Paul McCartney. Discussions revolve around Lady Di’s drinking, Sandy Kane’s past lawsuit and "twatto," and Stalker Patty's experiences of homelessness and working at a strip club. A prank call to the "Wake Up with Taylor" show is played, featuring similar vulgarity.

A segment focused on the negative aspects of weddings follows. Patty recounts her experiences at Show World, performing a song about her vibrator. The discussion critiques wedding music, attire, the presence of children, and the expenses involved.  Guest Kenny engages in suggestive banter.  Commercial breaks and promotion of Jim Florentine's podcast, "Comedy Metal Midgets," are included. The show continues with a rant against engagement parties and a discussion about the inappropriateness of hip-hop at weddings, with sarcastic suggestions for “safe” options.  Numerous advertisements follow, including for Jim Florentine's podcast, medical shows, lubricants, cancer treatment, cosmetics, fuel system treatments, meatballs, legal services, SiriusXM Fantasy Sports Radio, adult entertainment, a dating site, business financing, and a car dealership.

The final major segment discusses a Joe Rogan Experience tour stop in Eugene, Oregon, during a severe snowstorm. A humorous video of car accidents is shown.  The segment features an anecdote about Joey Diaz's experiences while high on edibles, involving encounters with fans and airport personnel, leading to highly inappropriate and hilarious situations.  The hosts discuss Diaz's high tolerance for edibles and his subsequent actions, concluding with a humorous recounting of the plane ride home.  The broadcast concludes with further advertisements and promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Stop. The more basic, the better.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't even have to try too hard.  I'll bet you've talked to everyone in China at least twice.  No.  Huh?  Who in China?  Yeah, exactly. So what, you talked to everyone in China once?  No, I don't know anybody in China.  Who?  I don't know who.  That's fine.  Jesus.  That's fine.  I know a few things that are made in China. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, yeah?  I don't know anybody in China.  Ah, okay.  Well, good for you.  I bet you used to work in a Chinese sweatshop.  No, I never did.  Oh, okay.  You never did.  Let me correct that a little bit.  When I was working for the tech agency, I did work for a couple of places that came close to being a sweatshop.  Oh, wow.  You probably know how to fly airplanes.  No.  Who is this I'm talking to?  Everybody. 
[00:01:00]  It's Sam.  It's Sam.  Opie Anthony.  Jim's out.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Sam.  How are you doing?  Jim left the show.  Oh, Jim left the show?  Listen, Sam.  I need to talk to you.  Oh, a little private conversation.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, talk to me.  Hold on, hold on.  No, not right now.  Not right now.  Okay.  When I get off the air, is there any way I can talk to you?  What's it about?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll put you on hold.  Take her off the air.  Hold on a minute.  We'll do the show.  You guys go off air.  Hold on a second.  Let's, uh. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, Lady Di?  Yes.  How did you get my phone number?  What do you mean, how did we get your phone number?  You called us, so we took.  You called us, and then we took down your phone number.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I just wanted to find out how in the world, you know, the interns got the phone number.  We were afraid that you had, like, a hundred phone numbers.  No, I don't know.  I just wanted to find out.  It's no big deal.  I just wanted to find out.  All right.  No, no, no.  No problem. 
[00:02:00]  Well, I don't know.  Did you say the interns had the phone number?  Yeah.  Oh, that's not good.  No, no, no.  No, it's fine.  I don't care about that.  No, because one of the interns this morning posted a phone number, and we didn't know whose  it was.  I just need to double check.  All right.  Listen to me.  Do not.  Whatever they do, do not.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  No, don't make it.  It's on a, it's on a, like, we can delete it off his Twitter.  Like, I take care of the intern, but it's already on a bunch of websites. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, but, you know, I'm looking for a job and everything like that, and, you know,  and I really don't feel like changing my phone number again.  Yeah, you may have to reapply, because this thing, this thing's going viral.  Wow.  Please don't do it, okay?  Oh, you can put me back on now with them.  Guy, this thing has, like, 100,000 hits on it.  Well, I don't know what to say. 
[00:03:00]  All right, put me back on.  All right, we're going to put you back on with O&A in five.  So, that was, like, my weekend was crazy.  That sounds it.  Lady Di, what's up?  Nothing much right now.  What were you talking to Sam about?  Nothing, really.  Well, why?  Did you at least tell us what you needed to ask him or what it was about?  No, I was just wondering.  Well, you know, I have nothing against this or anything like that,  but I was just wondering how in the world did the interns get my phone number? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy, what was that beep?  I heard a beep in the background.  I don't know.  Maybe he's marrying.  I have no idea.  Oh, no.  Oh, don't tell me not again, right?  What happened?  What do you mean not again?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  I told her what one of the interns did.  Oh, about posting her phone number?  Yeah.  Who's calling you?  I have no idea, and I don't want to know. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, no.  Your phone number got out again.  We better let you go to deal with that, all right?  Oh, lady Di.  Oh, yeah, I'll try to.  Well, hold on a second now.  I mean, what exactly are people – have you answered the phone at all?  Like, what is it?  Maybe it's a legit call.  No, I haven't answered it yet.  I have no idea what it is.  You want to answer it?  No, I'm through with that.  I'm done with that.  I'm going to have to go back and change it again.  You've got to answer it, though.  It might be a legit call. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That's a good – yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm not going to answer them.  Why?  All right.  Hold on, we're talking to you.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Hold on a second.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  So what's the problem?  Nothing right now.  Oh, shit.  This thing is everywhere.  Oh, boy.  That's ringing a lot.  Yeah.  I'm going to clean it up.  It's on Facebook, Twitter.  Are you sure it's not, like, legit calls?  Who's Frank?  I have no idea what it is.  Who's this guy?  Huh?  Oh, hold on. 
[00:05:00]  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Someone's calling you.  Oh, Frank wants to talk to Lady Di.  Frank?  Hey, doing.  This is Frank from Philly.  Is this guy looking for a job?  Does she know how to drive a bulldozer?  I could probably get her some work.  Not in Philadelphia.  Can you drive a bulldozer?  You just want to be a lazy man and just sit around the fucking house all day, you know? 
[00:05:30]  He's looking for a guy who could drive a bulldozer.  Right.  That's not a bad opportunity.  Well, first of all, I'm not a guy.  And second of all, I don't drive a bulldozer.  Oh.  All right.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  Why do you have to go?  Why do you have to go?  Because I might have to go.  Where are you going, mister?  You've got no job.  Hang out.  All right.  Good.  Hold on.  I want to have to go.  We're talking to you.  How many beers are you drinking?  You know what?  I'm not even counting anymore.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  Why?  What's the matter? 
[00:06:00]  Why?  What's wrong?  Sound panicked.  What if the people trying to call you are offering you jobs?  And what about Frank from Philly?  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Mr. Dye, I can't give a guy a job that's drinking.  You know what I mean?  You can't drive around trucks when you're drunk.  You know what I mean, dude?  Uh, he hung up.  Thank you, Frank.  All right.  Is this lady dying?  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Hold on.  Is this lady dying? 
[00:06:30]  Hello?  Will this lady die?  Call it back.  Call it back.  What a terrible call.  That is terrible.  It's all me.  Hello?  Yeah.  It's all Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  Bob Levy convinced that Lady Di is a guy.  I love it.  It was such a great bit.  A message.  Uh-oh.  Oh, let's try again.  Let's try again.  By the way, all those calls.  We didn't give her a number out.  No, no.  All the calls were just me.  Yeah, it was you. 
[00:07:00]  It's all me.  Just dialing her.  Come on.  Pick up the phone.  She thinks it's a bunch of people.  It's the same number.  Please leave your message.  Oh, come on.  Lady Di.  She's panicking.  She is panicking.  There's only one number that he's called.  Yeah.  It's the same number.  I blocked it.  I blocked it.  Oh, you did.  She probably thinks it's a whole bunch of people.  Yeah.  Oh, I got it.  I hope she changes the number.  It's literally just me.  I hope she changes the number again.  Please leave your phone.  Oh, you dummy. 
[00:07:30]  Give it a second.  All right.  Because Sam kept track of all the questions she answered as legitimate questions.  Wow.  Do you want to play What Did We Learn About Lady Di?  Oh, please.

What?  Let's give her a little ring-a-dingy.  I don't think I'm having my Bruce Kelly.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm absolutely crying through your tears.  I laughed that hard in a long time.

I can drink 10 million beers in a day.  10 million beers.  She legitimately answered whether or not she drinks 10 million beers.  No one can do that.  No.  Oh, my God.  She gets so stuck in making her points that you just throw it.  And she goes, no.  And then she goes, no, no.  She's truly a stupid woman.  You throw your own shit?  No.  Anyway.

It's got to be basic, like the most childlike questions you can possibly ask her.  I can't think so much about it.  No.  She doesn't deal in metaphors.  She doesn't deal in...  We all fuck up.  We'll answer one every once in a while, but not 26.  She answered 26 in a five-minute chat.  In a row.  Are you going to the moon?  No, I'm not going to the moon. 
[00:13:30]  No, not the moon.  I can't go to the moon?  I like when she elaborates something like that.  No, the moon.  I can't get to the moon.  You can't get to the moon.  Well, I think that's impossible.  Yeah.  I'm not going to drive a tank.  I'm going to get a limo.  Three natty ice deeps.  A deep at a fucking nine.  That's the one thing she'll be truthful about, though.  Yeah, how much she's drinking.  Three.  Three.  Three.  I'm on my third. 
[00:14:00]  What a waste.  What, do you want me to lie?  Yeah.  Okay, well, you're an honest fucking drunk.  And she starts lying about everything else.  Her job or three natty ices before 9 a.m.  How many does she drink a day if she gets three in before 9?  It's not 10 million.  I've got that confirmed.  That fucking morning beer breath.  And she slept, so it's not like she's drinking all night.  Do you think her breath is a thing?  Oh, God.  Morning natty ice breath.  Do you think she, uh, do you think she brushes her teeth first?  No. 
[00:14:30]  Look, if you had...  Fucks up the flavor of the beer.  If you had a donkey in front of you and Lady Di, like, face down, ass up, seriously, what would you do?  No matter what you say, before Lady Di, face down, up, I would fuck that.  Donkey.  I don't know what it is.  A brick.  Fuck, a guy with a bomb belt?  Yeah.  Imagine that fucking, like, her fat ass.  She's bent over in front of the fridge.  Snapping another natty ice off of the six-pack rings. 
[00:15:00]  With the elephant ass, you know, where it's all the sagging, right?  Hanging.  Right where the goodness should be.  An old, like, refrigerator with a big pull handle thing, and she's just cracking another one.  Christ.  Ah.  Ah.  A natty ice for me.  I've deserved it.  I've earned this beer.  I thought about getting a job today.  I deserve it.  I can't figure out the dollar store website.  Now I have to go to the phone store and get my phone number changed again.  It's going to change, because people are calling me. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy.  Want me to try it one more time?  Okay, I was looking at it.  Give her a, um.  Give her a ring-a-ding.  Oh, you bet.  See if, uh.  It's like Groundhog Day.  Oh.  But it's the best.  Every time it's the exact same fucking.  We could ask her this same series of questions next time.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  I don't drink out of a giant vat.  A vat.  A vat.  Oh, that was one, too.  The vat.  Oh, yeah.  Hello?  Hey, is this lady guy?  Hey, lady guy, is this you, lady guy?  How did you get my number?

[00:29:00]  Dan Matterman was not doing well on Tinder  he fucking rules  that could be a bummer then  yeah  what if you're sitting there  you get nothing  yeah but it feels good to reject girls also  you get girls that are 7th and 8th  and you go  nah  it just feels good to swipe  dislike  but what do you do if you like them  if you like them  nothing happens  if they like you  and you like them  a message pops up  and says hey  you guys are into each other's look  holy shit  I'll leave it on you  but I mean  my Facebook has a lot of bad pictures of me  but you can upload 5 pictures  to Tinder  John Reeb said he pretty much has his resume on there

[00:39:00]  mike bachetti  bobo  lady die  stalker patty  and the return  of one of the most  beloved  hated  and controversial  figures  in the history  of the opian anthony show  we'll get to that  but right now  it's a fight  and I love a fight  I walked in  on  I believe it was  wednesday morning  and at 5 15  in the morning  I see travis  and sal  who are both  producers for the show  screaming at each other  over work that had 
[00:39:30]  or hadn't gotten done  I didn't really know  what it was about  but whenever I see people  screaming at each other  I think it's valuable  valuable  to bring that to the air  it's like a lifeblood  for me  so I decided to let  the guys know  and let sal and travis  hash it out  for all to see  here it is  let's relive it together  on the countdown  number six  we like to do  some house cleaning  early in the morning 
[00:40:00]  while people are still  getting the sleepies  out of their eyes  and then we do  our real material  sure  was there a problem  this morning  oh yeah  oh boy  what was today's problem  oh boy  come on  couldn't be a problem  around here  no  we got three shows  left in this fine year  and then  in the new year  we become  a media destination  nice  that's right  well you know  Sal's been out  he was out 
[00:40:30]  Monday and Tuesday  by the way  had no idea  holy  I was just  going to say that  I had no idea  I could have sworn  I saw him in the halls  or something  didn't I see him  he was actually out  he was not here  I know E-Rock was out  because we  you know  talked about that  for an hour  yeah actually  Roland E-Rock  and Sal  have been out  so far  you didn't know that Jim  well I've been in touch  with Roland a lot  via text  Roland still is present  yes  he was not happy  with the Roland compost  he didn't like that 
[00:41:00]  no  Roland I have  the what  when I said Roland  instead of Roland Campbell  Roland compost  basically calling him  garbage  a lump of shit  yes  but Roland I've been in touch  with E-Rock  I just forgot was alive  at this point  and Sal  no I thought Sal was here  no Sal was not here  and  E-Rock is deep  into his winter slumber  oh yeah  I think he's loading up  on winter snacks  oh boy is he  curled up under a pile  of leaves  he's hibernating somewhere  for his long winter nap  yes  bulking up 
[00:41:30]  but so  Travis was covering  for basically  for Eric and Sal  completely  while they were gone  nice  and we had a last minute  addition  you know the podcast  came out today  the O.P. Anthony podcast  what's on this week's podcast  by the way  get that out of the way  the original plan  was for today's podcast  to be Kevin Hart  and Big A  getting squirted on  oh that was a good one  but we had all felt  that since Lady Di  was so strong  wait can I stop you  the squirting is  by a fine young lady 
[00:42:00]  by the way  oh yeah  okay  well because squirting  just sounds like  who gives a fuck  but if it's coming  out of vagina  that's what  that's what's gonna sell  the podcast  to the families  out there  and it was somebody  it was like a famous  porn star too  it was like  was it Sunset Thomas  or Flower Tucci  or  was Flower Tucci  it was her right  we had her in  yeah  oh  yeah I think it was  Flower Tucci  real famous  oh  well  I don't even remember  who it was  that's very famous  she's a big squirter  she's a big name squirter  Flower Tucci 
[00:42:30]  but we thought that  since Lady Di  was so strong this week  that we had to add her  to this week's podcast  so Sal  does the podcast  every week  he puts the material  together  and he puts it up there  right  and so I texted him  yesterday  and said hey  just so you know  we're adding this  so come in  with enough time  tomorrow morning  that you can do  a quick edit  add it to the podcast  and publish it  before we go on the air  and he asked if  Travis had been  cutting the worst of  bits during the week  I asked Travis 
[00:43:00]  Travis said no  I have not  I've been doing  everybody else's job  that's low on my list  my priority list  low on the scrotum poll  that's what I say  fucking call me a  oh yeah  he said I've been  prioritizing  worst of  that we would only  really use at the end  of the week  is low on my  priority list  that's something  Sal can do  when he gets back  I said okay  I texted Sal  that information  he was not happy  when he heard that  but regardless  I said that's the  information  and then this morning 
[00:43:30]  did you know  he wouldn't be happy  when he heard that  yeah he was texting  me unhappily  okay  and then this morning  I was like 515  520 maybe  and I am watching  two guys just  screaming at each other  wow  yeah  I mean  Sal is furious  that the work  hasn't been done  Travis is going like  what the fuck  do you want from me  whoa  what are you talking  to me like that for  wow  it was like a real  like knockdown  that sounds crazy  I thought for once  everyone was getting  along around here 
[00:44:00]  oh man  once you get more  than three people  here you're not  going to have a  situation where  everybody's getting  a wall  oh wow  okay  yeah I mean  Travis and Sal  were right  in the middle  of a  this isn't the  first time  those two  have gone at it  right  no  and it was  just as good  as the time  they fucking  started going  at it on the air  apparently it's not  it's not enough  that I cover  three jobs  I should also  be doing things  that I know  nothing about  right because  Travis didn't  know that  Sal was going  to need that 
[00:44:30]  clip for the  podcast  and I told  him I said  if I knew  that you  needed it  this morning  I would have  cut it for  you  but I  didn't know  so how am I  supposed to do  something I  don't know  about  you're supposed  to read  minds or  something  apparently  Sal was mad  and felt slighted  well where's  Sal  we should have  him in here  he's back  in the office  let's get  Sal  Sal felt  slighted  that Travis  hadn't done  the worst of  because I  think Sal  probably felt  like hey  how come  you can't  cover for  me  you can  cover for  other people  what do you  think I am  some kind  of piece of 
[00:45:00]  shit  I covered  every single  thing that  Sal asked me  to do in  his email  and every  single thing  that Eric  has asked  me to do  in his  email  and Eric's  email  it said  cut up the  worst of  if you have  time  if not  Sal can  do it  on Wednesday  I thought  the fight  was over  first super  group Asia  that's true  and what was  their most  popular song  that didn't  even come up  in the conversation  that's so  strange  look at the  iteration we  have today  Sal with  the lifelike  hair  he's got  the beard 
[00:45:30]  going  you never  know what  he's going  to come in  with  what iteration  of hairstyle  Sal will  have  you gotta go  ugly beard  man  I had it  for a little  while  you didn't  it was  well trimmed  hipster  no neck  beard  for Sal  no  because the  rest of the  hipsters  aren't  growing it  on their  neck  what are  the hipsters  doing these  days with  facial hair  who knows  who cares  Jesus  should shave  with a shotgun  that's implied 
[00:46:00]  he's saying  you should  shoot yourself  there's no  reason for  that  in the face  it is  so Sal  welcome back  we didn't  know you were  gone for a  couple days  I hope you  enjoyed a long  weekend  thank you  you didn't  said a minute  ago  you didn't  know he  was gone  he wasn't  here though  I heard  I heard  everything  so what  happened  that's exactly  it  you have  fucking had  it with this  shit  haven't you  I'm a big 
[00:46:30]  fan of people  fighting back  that's what I've  tried to tell  Eric for years  that's all I  want from that  fucking kid  but there was  no sort of  come in for  Sal and be  like hey  man what's  going on  did you get  a chance  to  he just  walked in  like what  the fuck  gangbusters  oh yeah  I just like  Erock  actually sent  out his  cover  Ecock  he actually  did send  out the  cover email  this time  which was  awesome  it helps  me out  knowing  what I  gotta do  each day 
[00:47:00]  and all  that sort  of stuff  look at  Erock  working from  home  that's  right  so in  the email  he said  wait what  kind of email  does Erock  send out  well first of  all he sends  the cover my  job email  midnight before  like on  midnight Sunday  these are the  things that need  to be done  in my absence  here's the difference  between me and  Sal and Eric  when Sal and I  are out  we send ours  like Sal sent  his cover email  like Friday  like three days  before anything  needed to be  covered  and I'll do  the same thing  Eric sends  us out  at midnight  Monday morning 
[00:47:30]  like when  everyone is  sleeping  so you wake  up to this  email  you can't  anticipate  anything  you know  what the  strategy  with that  is  that way  if there's  any questions  about anything  there's no  time to ask  oh you can't  even ask  because you  know he's  already sleeping  right  I got you  that's hilarious  that's hilarious  God I love you  right  do you think  he does it  on purpose  just to kind  of get it  out there  of course  him and his  sneaky little  tricks  see I'm not  sure if he  does it on  purpose or if  he is sitting  at home and  then goes  oh fuck 
[00:48:00]  maybe  yeah  Erica  Erica  Eric is  the poster  of America  yeah  we got to  get that  made  someone's  got to  make Eric  as the  ultimate  American  consumer  like the  Obama  change  posters  except it  just is a  picture of  Eric and  under it  it says  America  yeah  I picture  Iraq in  this poster  with a lot  of stuff  around him  yeah  representing  America  if you know  what I mean  but he has  to be sitting  down  and instead  of change  it says  do nothing  right  we got a lot  of artists  out there 
[00:48:30]  yeah  work on an  Eric  poster  we'll put  the best ones  on our  Facebook page  that's your  Christmas break  assignment  yeah do it  because he is  the ultimate  consumer  we all know  that  I love  Iraq  and he knows  how to take  a shortcut  or two  yeah  you think  Iraq will cut  corners when he can  oh boy  but that's  America  that's what  I'm trying  to say  he represents  way more  people than  anyone else  in this  fucking room  I'll tell you  right now  he's the  American dream  because he 
[00:49:00]  spends so  much time  trying to  figure out  shortcuts  he could  spend less  time just  doing the  work  that's the  American way  that's why  I want this  done  I want the  Iraq America  poster done  what was that  line in  office space  where it's like  it pretty much  gives you the  incentive to do  just enough  work to  not get  fired  that's like  what he does  just enough  to keep  your job  the best place  to be is  just under  the radar  not too far 
[00:49:30]  under the  radar  just under  where every  once in a while  you might see  a blip  and you go  wait what was  that  but then they  go I guess  that was  nothing  but it's  getting done  anyway go  ahead  Sal  that was  pretty much  that  I thought  that Travis  would have  done it  and so I  could come  in first  thing get  that shit  up there  nice and  early  550  my fucking  train again  is being  retarded  what time  did you get  here  like 
[00:50:00]  ten after  that's cool  ten after five  so yeah  I mean  that's exactly  what happened  I asked  Travis  and then  we were  but you  didn't ask  Travis  you weren't  like hey  buddy  did you  get the  I said  did you  have the  worst of  because that's  just something  Sam told you  yesterday that I  didn't so why  would you even  ask  well I  because I  specifically  said to  Sam  maybe he's  going to do  it between  now and  tomorrow  why would I  fucking just  like  fabricate a  situation  maybe you  could took  it home  or something 
[00:50:30]  like that  there's many  scenarios  many scenarios  only worry about  the problem  when it's  finally addressed  and when you  absolutely need  to come to  it  nobody told  me so I  don't know  how I was  supposed to  cut it up  for you  but how  did you know  that Sam  informed me  about that  information if  you didn't  know  Sam told me  Sam asked  have you been  cutting up  worst of  and I said  no so that's  how I knew  Sam didn't  tell me  oh by the  way I'm  going to  ask Sal  to cut up  the lady  die phone  call for  tomorrow  morning  don't do  it 
[00:51:00]  when you  told me  that the  lady die  phone call  needed to  be on the  podcast  this morning  that was  the absolute  first time  I had  heard about  it  but Sal  was pissed  generally  that the  worst of  wasn't being  cut up  while he  was gone  well yeah  when we do  worst of  the right  way to do  it is you  got to listen  to that  thing in  real time  you got to  go back  you got to  listen to  lucky you  hilarious  I wasn't  here so I  didn't hear  the show  that's why  when Erock  was doing  more stuff  he supposedly  heard the  show that  day or  that segment 
[00:51:30]  you get to  bathe in our  greatness  for free  job  that should  be your  pay  you just  need to  listen to  this  the privilege  of listening  again  I love  listening to  you guys  anyway  so now  I didn't  hear the  show  I'm sorry  not to  offend you  guys  I didn't  listen to  the show  Monday or  Tuesday  what about  the part  where you  said I  love  listening to  you guys  that's  true  I don't  want to  have a  dick  sucking  fest  here  but I  don't  listen to  you guys 
[00:52:00]  forever  why not  we weren't  talking about  dick  sucking  just brings  that out of  thin air  weird  but yeah  so I  didn't hear  the show  so I  have to  now go  in and  carefully  listen to  it  and it  takes a  while  so  therefore  nobody's  saying  you do  I could  do  that  today  but I  didn't  have any  time to  do it  on Monday  and Tuesday  when I'm  doing the job  of three  people  would you  say that if  you were doing  the job of  three people 
[00:52:30]  and you didn't  need something  done until  Friday you  would probably  push it until  you had more  time  well  one thing  one thing  one thing is  we don't  need that  until Friday  wait wait wait  there it is  what  the moment  where I  just don't  give a shit  anymore  there it was  it was right  then and there  people  you not interested  I could give a  fuck  me too  shut up  you don't like  the back and forth  no it's just 
[00:53:00]  ponderous  and fucking  it's tedium  but why were you  guys screaming  I guess it's just  this early in the  morning everyone's  just fucking  on head  because after two  days of doing  three jobs the  last thing I want  to hear is why  didn't you do  something you  didn't know about  on top of all  that shit  it said in the  email though  yeah it said in  the email that I  could push it off  on you on  Wednesday  so that's just  so that's what it  said in the email  that's sad dude  is it really sad  that I did three  fucking jobs for  two days  I always cover 
[00:53:30]  for everyone here  really so you've  come in before  and you've done  the prep sheets  the news stories  you've run the  board you've sent  audible you've  done the replay  you've pulled  the live reads  you've sent the  library you've  done all that  before really  I can do  every one of  those jobs  and you've done  it all in a  day yeah  there's been a  really there's  been a day  where me and  Eric have been  out and you've  had to do all  of that  sure really  yeah go find  that day  I guarantee you  it has never  happened before  that has never  happened before  look I'm not  getting all riled  up over this  you're you're  you're clearly 
[00:54:00]  more upset about  having to do  extra work  oh man  holy shit  when someone  when someone  says you can  do this  or you can  wait till  someone else  does it  I just like  me as a  person I like  to just fucking  do it and get  it done because  then I can say  I didn't have  time I'm sorry  you didn't have  time but sometimes  like I don't  know that's all  I didn't have  time to do it  you should have  made time  that's all  that's all  I'm done  that's it 
[00:54:30]  I'm not getting  riled up  I don't I  can't I don't  want that in my  life anymore  I don't I  don't want to  you're the one  who came in  with a fucking  bitchy attitude  the B word  that's not like  a manly thing  no no that's  like a girly  thing  a bitchy attitude  that just conveys  like that you're  kind of  I asked you  if you had it  and you go  I was doing  three jobs  you were told  yesterday  what the situation  was  I told you  I wouldn't  make an  assumption  until I came  into work  where all the  media and all  the shit is  to see if you  had done it 
[00:55:00]  there's a strong  chance you could  have done it  at home  so you maybe  why would I  put that on  you that you  didn't do it  maybe I thought  you took the  initiative  afterwards  maybe you  thought there  was going  to be a  dick sucking  fest  here  absolutely  I was hoping  to  bitchy  is like  you came  in here  all bitchy  you're not  going to take  somebody seriously  when they're  being bitchy  that's like  the wife  is being  bitchy  she's on  her period  that's what  Travis  met with me  he was on  the rag  bleeding from  the twat  just like how 
[00:55:30]  he did now  he started  getting all  riled up  after two  days of  doing three  jobs  we work  for the  show  you're the  laziest  fuck here  how many  fucking hours  you still  don't give  a shit  how many  times  have they  brought you  into the  studio  and called  you out  on your  laziness  don't talk  to me  after I've  done a  laundry list  of shit  for two  days  and I  didn't pull  something  that I  didn't know 
[00:56:00]  about  I didn't  pull something  that I  didn't know  about  please  dude  come on  bro  do you  want to  specifically  go over  it  do you  really  want to  specifically  go over  it  dude  do you  want to  do  that  right  yet  you  want to  talk  about  when you  leave  early  because you  want to  train  or whatever  bullshit  don't  fucking  tell me  there wasn't  time  because  there's  always  fucking  time  because I  always  fucking  stay here  late  I'm  always  here  fucking  late  doing  shit  and I  don't  complain  about  it  either 
[00:56:30]  you're  complaining  about it  right now  complaining  about  is that  you  couldn't  believe  that I  didn't  do  something  that  I  didn't  know  about  I  came  in  and  asked  you  nicely  and  you  started  bitching  at  me  if  Sam  had  told  this  is  boring  Anthony  I  like  this  now  really  Sal  well  the  jerk  star  called  I  already  explained  this  to you  and  then  you  apologized  to me  I  pulled 
[00:57:00]  the  I  will  admit  I  pulled  a  passive  aggressive  move  I  said  I'm  sorry  because  I  didn't  want  to  fucking  hear  him  call  me  to  tell  me  to  fucking  calm  down  that's  what  you  do  with  your  chick  you  take  the  grenade  just  to  cover  the  fucking  problem  I'm  going to  go start  working  because  you were  told to  come in  and work  on it  I  don't  care  doing  the  work  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  work  I'm 
[00:57:30]  fine  with  that  it's  a matter  of  that  you  know  that  if  you  just  don't  feel  like  doing  the  fucking  work  you  could  pawn  it  off  on  me  did  anyone  ever  see  that  Star Trek  episode  where  that  cloud  thing  fed  off  the  violence  and  it  loved  the  hate  that  was  going  on  between  the  Klingons  and  the  earthlings  that  is  Sam  right  here  I'm  seeing  Sam  soaking  up  this  hatred  and  conflict  and  just  converting  it  into  energy  which  by  the  way  you  are  also  looking  very  happy 
[00:58:00]  right  now  I  love  it  Robert  you  were  tapped  out  a  minute  ago  and  you're  all  in  now  because  then  the  voices  started  raising  I'm  like  I  love  it  and  this  just  feels  like  home  to  me  I'm  back  at my  family  home  see  the  one  thing  I  may  jump  in  for  a  second  you're  diffusing  though  man  I  know  we're  losing  the  energy  I  know  I  don't  want  to  but  here's  here's  I  might 
[00:58:30]  stoke  the  flames  again  by  just  saying  this  I  still  don't  understand  who  is  kind  of  in  the  right  and  who  is  in  the  wrong  here  I  don't  even  know  what  really  happened  there  is no  right  and  wrong  somebody  didn't  do  something  and  someone  was  supposed  to  do  it  and  I  still  don't  know  Sal  was  supposed  to  cut  something  up  for  this  morning  I  would  have  happily  done  it  yesterday  if  I  knew  that  it  was  a  time  sensitive  thing 
[00:59:00]  it  was  sent  in  the  email  and  you  interpreted  you  made  it  a  projection  upon  yourself  that  I  don't  have  to  do  this  because  Sal  will  do  it  Wednesday  morning  in  the  event  that  we  needed  that  material  which  I  have  more  important  things  to  do  Sal  when  something  is  not  needed  until  Friday  I  can  push  it  apparently  it  wasn't  needed  until  Friday  it  was  needed  fucking  Tuesday  morning  at  3am  and  did  I  know  about  that  what  does  it  matter  it  said  it  in  the  email  to  do  it  because  that's  the  whole  point  Sal  if  it's  not  timely 
[00:59:30]  it  can  be  pushed  to  later  in  the  week  if  it  is  timely  it'll  get  done  that  you  know  you  want  to  say  whatever  you  want  to  say  on  the  air  but  you  know  deep  in  your  heart  you  interpreted  do  it  Monday  Tuesday  or  Sal  can  do  it  Wednesday  you  don't  even  fucking  address  the  first  two  parts  of  that  you  just  say  hmm  Sal  when I  see  something  can be  pushed  till  Wednesday  I'm  going to  push  it  till  Wednesday  because  I've  got  other  things  to do  I've  been  here  for  two  years  we've  been  doing  it  every  day  longer  as 
[01:00:00]  an  intern  we've  been  doing  it  I  thought  we  cut  up  worst  every  day  because  it's  something  if  Ope  says  hey  do  we  have  that  clip  from  yesterday  because  we  could  pull  it 
[01:00:30]  homeless  could  be  some  food  coming  and  that  could  be  a  problem  I  don't  know  what  you  can  do  you're  right  I  don't  know  what  you're  willing  to  put  into  the  show  you're  right  you  don't  you  will  never  put  in  what  I  put  into  the  show  worst  of  what  does  it  take  it  takes  maybe  an  extra  hour  maybe  I  didn't  have  an  extra  hour  maybe  I've  got  other  things  to  do  I  have  a  family  at  home  that  depends  on  me  to  be  there  at  a  certain  time  insinuating 
[01:01:00]  that you  can't  have  children  with  a  woman  because  you  can't  get  a  boner  maybe  I've  got  a  more  delicate  time  spent  here  doesn't  necessarily  mean  you're  putting  in  the  work  you're  just  here  some  people  might  be  able  to  manage  their  time  better  than  you  I'm  just  saying  I  like  that  I  am  absolutely  willing  to  stay  late  to  do  shit  I  have  no  problem  with  your  little  baits  I've  been here 
[01:01:30]  nine  years  I  think  I'm  doing  a  pretty  damn  good  that's  some  seniority  right  there  okay  and  that's  fine  that  people  pass  off  work  to  me  it's  perfectly  fine  but  I  just  know  I  absolutely  fucking  know  you  interpreted  that  information  that  Iraq  gave  you  as  I  don't  need  to  as  it  can  wait  until  Wednesday  and  that's  what  it  did  Sal  were  you  covering 
[01:02:00]  for  anybody  that  wasn't  here  everybody  does a  great job  covering  for  everybody  oh  that's  right  he  wasn't  here  Monday  or  Tuesday  and  neither  was  Iraq  when  Iraq  isn't  here  I  cover  for  Iraq  when  Travis  isn't  here  so  you  and  Iraq  weren't  here  Sam  and  Travis  were  so  they  are  covering  obviously  for  you  and  Iraq  absolutely  then  you  come  in  middle 
[01:02:30]  of  the  week  and  give  people  shit  about  that's  all  I'm  getting  here  now  they  obviously  had  to  cover  for  two  people  down  for  two  days  you  come  in  and  start  giving  them  shit  well  no  it  was  I  explained  the  particular  detail  it's  not  the  overall  I  understand  what  you're  saying  of  course  you  do  I  hope  so  but  it's  not  only  not  giving  people  shit  but  thank  you  sometimes 
[01:03:00]  you  just  need  to  strip  it  down  to  the  basics  strip  strip  it  down  to  the  basics  we  can  we  can  I  don't  know  oh  boy  oh  boy  oh  you  want  to  tap  out  now  that  deflated  him  a little  bit  I  explain  my  point  and  Sal  doesn't  agree  though  it's  falling  on deaf ears  is that  what you're  saying  no I'm  not  saying  that  oh  boy  but why don't  you go with  what Anja said  I agree with it  absolutely  I said the thing  that irritated me  was that  specific element  of  what he  did  I think 
[01:03:30]  there's more  stuff at play  here  it just  happened to be  the straw  that broke  the camel's  back  underlying  element  we should  call it  rock  oh yeah  let's see  what he says  he'd love it  because he's  like see  I'm not in  there and  the place  falls apart  yeah  I mean  it's not  falling apart  everything is  getting done  of course  it looks  like  yeah  the fact  of the matter  is  three days  before  vacation  if I see  a fight  going on 
[01:04:00]  we gotta  I mean  if we can  fill an hour  we can  fill an hour  it's all  about filling  these hours  nothing falling  apart  can I go get  you rock  online  is that cool  oh wow  he's not gonna  answer  he will never  answer at this  hour  he's on to us  finally  it only took him  nine years  but he's on to us  finally  Sal  you talk about  being a quick  learner  he's going  wait a minute  I'm kind of  in the barrel  now  because I  figured out  that my  argument was  not great  deflect  what I can  do  is shit  on erock  something  no  let me get him  on the phone  I got a big 
[01:04:30]  pile of shit  that fell on my  head  I need to  dump it on  someone  but in order  to call him  I have to be  out of the  studio  see you guys  later  final thoughts  ah final  thoughts  summation  let's get an  apology from  somebody  I agree  Sam  an apology  always heals  I already got  one  oh  that was  the passive  aggressive  you're a bitch  apology  you said you  were sorry  already  I'm not genuinely  sorry at all  I don't need  no man  when you say 
[01:05:00]  I'm sorry  to the wife  because you  don't want the  argument to  keep going  you're not  really sorry  but we all  know all  sorries are  bullshit  I don't need  an apology  I know that  I do a good  job  and nobody  knew Sal  was out  so that  must mean  I do a  good job  I don't  even want  to  I wouldn't  want to  come back  from that  either  you don't  want to  what  and when  you're not  here dude  when I'm  not here  when I'm  not here  it's brought 
[01:05:30]  up on the  air  the lower  quality  of the  prep  holy shit  I'm  devastating  bluff  getting us  involved  oh shit  they were  stuck  oh he's  not lying  they're undeniable  truths  Sal may be in  line for the  bare bottom  spanking  you gotta  fight your  way out  of the  corner  let's go  this is it  I was doing  rope  without that  rope  part 
[01:06:00]  I got  it  when you  write your  cover email  to me  it is  literally  only what  Danny did  therefore  I'm not  sure  Obama  with George  W.  Bush  the hell  are you  blaming  the past  administrations  therefore  I'm not  sure what  you did  prior to  then  I know  you do  audible  now  and that's  only because  you absorbed  something that  Sam was  doing  so I  really don't  fucking know  what you were 
[01:06:30]  doing prior  to then  you're not  paying attention  Sal  I'm not  paying  attention  okay  and  oh god  I can't  do this  right now  oh  he's  walking  wait what  happened  you're  on the air  you're gonna  look really  bad if you  just walk  why  you gotta  just speak  your mind  don't get  anxious  why are you  getting anxiety  what's going  on  nothing  I  what  you can't  walk out  like that  you know  I think  this needs  let's get  Troy Kwan  in here  to  tell you 
[01:07:00]  both what  you are  Troy  I can say  this  the company's  still not  over the  Troy Kwan  oh boy  oh boy  I thought  a different  season would  relax everybody  I thought it  might be an  easy one  wow  oh boy  are they  not over  that  that was  a biggie  yeah  boy  what's  what's  Sal  he said  he had  the headphones  off  he was  ready to  walk  why are you  having anxiety  I just  I just  don't want to  argue over 
[01:07:30]  something  that's so  fucking  boring  yeah like  that's the  thing  like  like when  you break  I know  you guys  are looking  for like  material here  but like  in the end  it's really  a petty  thing  oh  besides the  yelling part  but who  do you  think  is a little  more petty  I really  don't care  oh wow  I don't  I don't care  why don't you  guys hug it  out then  I'll hug  Sal  I don't want  any hugs  hug  hug  hug  hug  if it's not worth  arguing about  we can hug  that's true  we only got a few  shows left in the 
[01:08:00]  year  we can't go into  the new year  like this  no we're gonna  start over  as we become  immediate destination  and I know  that I can  I know I can speak  for myself when I  say I don't want  this to end negatively  kiss kiss kiss kiss  let's see who's  bigger down there  let's see who's  bigger down there  I'm glad that's  taken care of  630  yeah  we figured we  get 20 minutes  out of it  squeeze a little  bit 
[01:08:30]  I think Sal  gets a little  emotional and upset  Sal does  Sal does  you cry when  you get angry  no I don't  being like the  bitch that  you know  by the way  Travis called  him  and guys  don't get  anxiety  you're puss  oh come on  you guys don't  get anxiety  you need a little  xanny  you need a xanny  no I don't  I don't  compensate  with like  you know  with guys  get anxiety  of course they do  I'm just  fucking making  a dumb joke  did you get  a little  anxiety attack  right there  when you were  not an anxiety  attack  but it just  started like  I get that  like 
[01:09:00]  building up  oh boy  I think  I bet  Jim's right  I bet  if Sal  gets really  mad I'll bet  he cries  because he gets  emotional  and so he has to  keep it  to a certain  level  again  adhering to  that bitch  title  that Travis  gave him  just earlier  but it's not  crying like  you're sad  and weepy  it's an angry  cry  I used to do  that same  thing  yeah  I don't think  I've ever  done that  that's because  you throw your  headphones off  you go  I can't even  do this right  now  I can't even  do this right  now  to stop  tears  okay 
[01:09:30]  she's getting  a little upset  again  I'm just trying  to have less  anger in my life  that's all  why do you have  anger  you always have  a good  I go from  like zero  to a hundred  like very  very  whoa  look at  not getting  stuff  what your  IQ  well  no  I think  another thing  was Sal  and I don't  blame him  for this  oh no  I hate  when they  team up  yeah  what is this  he's been  beaten  by a lot  of people  are you talking  about specifically  O.B. Anthony  and Jim  yeah that might  be who I'm  talking about 
[01:10:00]  I've left him  alone lately  I think I've  been very  cool  everyone is  literally like  just before  he came in  you guys said  you had no  idea that he  wasn't here  like literally  this morning  that's just  a dumb joke  we're just  concentrating  we're just  pulling down  a stupid  wall now  we're so  self-centered  we just  pay attention  to our own  lives  Sal used to  drive me  insane  but he's  kind of  dresses a little  less  provocatively  but he's 
[01:10:30]  absolutely  improved  so  he sticks  up for  himself  like two  weeks ago  and he's  working harder  and I think  he got some  of our  messages  I don't  expect people  to get all  of our  messages  because  it might  be our  craziness  or my  craziness  but he  does fight  back  yeah I  like that  oh he  will  he fights  back  and he  also  I think  he panics  a little  when he  thinks that  he might  be getting  a beat  down  on the  air  let me  just  because  because  of what  you guys  have done  in the  past  like two  weeks ago  the podcast  wasn't  uploading  at six 
[01:11:00]  in the  morning  and it  was no  fault  of his  it was  it was  the software  that just  wasn't  uploading  it  and I'm  like bro  it's cool  like calm  down  it's not  your fault  it's not  your fault  it's not  gonna get  uploaded  oh boy  can you tell  opie  I'm like yeah  of course  like it's  cool dude  like don't  worry  the fucking  bro part  these are  great days  bros  bros  bros  let's go  let's go  talk about  it in the  bathroom  let's have a  little bathroom  meeting  see we  started in a  very angry  place and 
[01:11:30]  now they're  just about  ready to  kiss  sound knows  I like  we're back  to fun  and games  I don't  know if  sound likes  me but  sound knows  no I  don't  you don't  like  Travis  no I  do  you just  said no  I don't  I don't  live with  hate  good social  message  except for  Danny  it's fun  he's not  even here  to defend  himself  you don't  like Danny  no he was  really mean  to me  wow  Danny's our  employee that 
[01:12:00]  hasn't been  here for a  year  a year  and a half  has he  even gotten  a year  yeah  you still  harboring  some resentments  over that  one  yeah I  don't like  him  wow  superfluously  mean to  me  anyway  I think  you could  find some  camaraderie  in that  statement  anyway  thank you  guys  all right  Sal  talk to  you guys  soon  you got  it  there goes  Sal  go pull

[02:48:00]  that is what  this one will be  about  and  I needed some  ideas  just in general  in case I miss  something  I put it out  on Facebook  and Twitter  hey you guys  what annoys you  about DJs  at weddings  and this and that  so you guys  really  helped me  give me some  ideas  so thank you  once again  always helps  when I have that  going on  before we even  get started  I got a show  on Ozzy's  Boneyard  on Sirius  Satellite Radio  Sirius XM 
[02:48:30]  whatever  it's channel 38  if you have Sirius  I do it every Thursday  from 5 to 7 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time  it's a two hour show  and then it replays  a bunch of times  during the week  if you don't catch it  on Thursday  it's on  Saturdays from 1 to 3  in the afternoon  it's all Eastern Standard  Sunday 9 to 11 p.m.  and then Tuesday  10 a.m. to noon  and it's also on  if you have Sirius XM  on demand  you can hear all the shows  on demand  so check it out  people are digging it  I play my own songs  it's awesome  I'm a big metal head  and it's great to just 
[02:49:00]  pick up the shit  that I want to hear  and a lot of people  notice it  I don't play any of the hits  just like getting back  to the wedding DJs  by playing all the hits  alright stop it  alright  there's no reason  to have Celebration  ever played  at a wedding again  nobody gives a shit  that song's fucking old  it's stale  we're gonna start  as soon as dinner's over  we're gonna start  the dancing  really is that what it is  yeah let's  everybody have dinner first 
[02:49:30]  and then we'll get  everybody on the dance floor  that's how it should work  and we'll start it off  with either Celebration  or We Are Family  you know cause you get it  cause there's a bunch  of families here  and like two families  that's together now  it's the bride  and the groom's family  now that they're like  one big family  so do you see  you see how  We Are Family  yeah  that song stinks  the line dance  Sweet Caroline  brutal  alright 
[02:50:00]  a bunch of drunk  Sweet Caroline  da da da  no reason for that song  overplayed  no one has fun  singing it  it's just like  ugh  you hear that  like oh great  maybe we'll watch  all the assholes  making up more  of an asshole  of themselves  it's Sweet Caroline  now let's get  all the guys  who put your arms  around each other  and we'll all sing it  cause remember  we did that  when we were kids  remember in our  early 20's  we used to do that  at parties  and now we're  in our mid 30's 
[02:50:30]  yeah  and we don't get  together that much  anymore  we just don't  you know  everyone's busy  our lives have changed  but whenever this song  comes on and reminds  us  we were in college  and we put our arms  around each other  and we just sang  Sweet Caroline  when we were drunk  wow  sounds like you had  a fucking blast  at parties  yeah  sounds like a great  wow  I wish I went  to college with you  that's the highlight  yeah  whenever that came on  no matter what  we were doing  yeah  if we're in the middle  of each sucking  each other's dicks  we stopped  and we sang  Sweet Caroline 
[02:51:00]  and that one  is over  we went right back  to sucking  each other's dicks  that's what we did  but we were in college  so it didn't really matter  we were just experimenting  ugh  ugh  how fucking corny  hot hot hot  never be played again  You Shook Me All Night Long  by ACDC  you ruined that song  these fucking  DJs at weddings  ruined that song  they have to play it  every time  let me get a little  rock set in now  we're gonna play a little  old time rock and roll 
[02:51:30]  You Shook Me All Night Long  and maybe Welcome to the Jungle  that's a little crazy  it might be a little heavy  for the people  to listen to  but I'm gonna put that  that's my rock set  go fuck yourself  that's my rock set  What I Like About You  by the Romantics  that song  was never good  it always stunk  don't ever play that  you get the goofy  white guy  in the dance floor  trying to dance  by himself  he puts his tie  around his head  like a headband  oh he's the crazy one 
[02:52:00]  oh watch out  Johnny  he's wild  look  there he goes again  he's got his tie  like a headband  that's crazy  you mean he took  his tie off  that means he's  really loose  cause a lot of  other assholes  have their tuxes  and their suit and ties on  no more suits  at weddings  alright  no more tuxes  stop making people  buy fucking tuxes  or rent tuxes  for 150 bucks  at least  when you wear  the thing once  stop making  fucking white guys

[03:27:30]  take they get fucking alcohol on their  breath and in their fucking body they  just drank a fucking three three shots of  whiskey all right they're not gonna  know if this cake tastes good or not  enough just go with me I'm not even  getting off the couch to go into the  kitchen to taste the cake it's important  to me because you know think when the  cake comes out don't you like it when  the when the husband and wife when the  DJ plays the bride cuts the cake right and  then you you have to stand and he cuts  it first because I think it's good luck 
[03:28:00]  right if the guy does they guess she has  to hold his wrist is that how it works  or something I don't even know yeah  they're gonna cut it they cut a PR I  see what that means that means they cut  their cake I really is that what it means  yeah are they gonna are they gonna  smoosh it in their face are they gonna do  it all oh no they're gonna feed each  other is she gonna do all he did it he  put it in her face oh isn't that funny  and then she did it back to him now they 
[03:28:30]  both got cake on their faces isn't this a  fun wedding isn't this fun you see  there's so much fun because she put cake  on his face and then he did it back that  stinks nothing fun about that nothing  pick the whole cake up and fucking dump  it on her head that'd be fun I go this  now this fucking this wedding started  this is a fucking party dump it on his  head it is fun it's my day don't put the 
[03:29:00]  cake in my face yeah I have a feeling you  don't want the cake in your face you  don't want anything else in your face  either so I have a feeling something  that's fucking taste delicious is gonna  be a problem too and we'll leave that at  that I think you know what I'm talking  about the fucking drunk corny guy there's  no segues in this by the way this  podcast all right I know you should  fucking stick with a theme but I'm just  all over the place because there's a lot  of shit to cover and I'm aggravated they 
[03:29:30]  want silverware I think I'm gonna go  check out the why what they don't have  silverware what I eat with their hands  no but they want new silverware that's  not my fucking problem what's wrong with  the old shit what the fork doesn't stick  into the fucking pancakes anymore it's  not my problem that he just they want  you know they want new silverware so  they put it on there so maybe we should  just get him silverware just give him  cash all right only chicks want the  gifts the guys want cash all right give  the guy probably had to pay for the 
[03:30:00]  wedding if the fucking you know if the  woman's dad didn't all right so just  give him cash he much rather open an  envelope a cash thing oh yeah they got  me the crock but thanks dude no one no  guy ever send a text out going dude  thanks for the crock pot nobody oh we  maybe we should get the big salad bowl  for them really they fucking couple  weighs 400 pounds a piece they I don't  think they eat salad maybe they're gonna 
[03:30:30]  use it for fucking potato chips that big  bowl all right so just call it the  potato chip bowl don't fucking try to  con me by saying you're gonna you want a  big salad bowl because you're gonna make  salad you're not making salad yeah we're  gonna have people over and you know I'll  make them all this stuff I want to have  it just in case really you got a dining  rooms but sitting there fucking for eight  years nobody's even walked in it just  put police tape around your fucking  dining room because no one's allowed in  there it's a fucking waste of space all 
[03:31:00]  right never fucking whoever's designing  houses now get rid of the fucking dining  room this is in the 1950s where people  got dressed up and come over your house  for dinner we don't do that anymore we're  fucking miserable we're angry don't want  to be around people we're busy we got  shit going on I don't have time to get  dressed up to go to a dinner all right  in your dining room we're gonna use the  good silverware today is that really  opposed to the bad what's the bad well  this is more shiny we're fucking just  all this shit going on all that is just 
[03:31:30]  nonsense it's just fucking garbage just  shit so now all this silverware that we  got two years ago is no good anymore  we're gonna get dumped that because you  know we can get it for free so what I  like the silverware this is fine I like  this fucking spoon it's nice and big it's  perfect for what I need we can just go to  the registry that it'll be fun people  could pick out stuff just listen to me 
[03:32:00]  it's my day cunt I don't want to be in  your wedding party you know what I do I  do you want to be my best man I just  make up shit look dude I gotta be honest  with you like five years ago I was drunk I  ate your fucking fiance's box I ate her box  one night I'm sorry but you know I was  hammered you still want me as your best  man yeah I don't think so good just save  myself a grand nice just save myself a  grand because I said that I ate your 
[03:32:30]  fiance's box five years ago that's how  you get out of a wedding party just say  something awful  the destination wedding yeah they're gonna  have a destination wedding so you want  all your friends to go fly to a fucking  island because you fucking spoiled  brat god that's why I want to get  married always I always dreamed of that 
[03:33:00]  when I was a girl a little girl no you  didn't you didn't dream of that you  dream you dreamt that you wish your  parents would stop fucking bickering and  be out of throats and stop arguing and  screaming because it scared you in your  room and you held on to your little  fucking dolls that's what you dreamed of  when you were a kid you didn't dream of a  fucking wedding in St. Martin where all  your friends are gonna have to spend  like 10 grand just to just to go there  okay no one's no fucking little girl 
[03:33:30]  dreamt that that's fucking selfish you  just thinking about yourself and then you  get mad when your friends don't come and  put your friends in a compromising  position because they're good friends  where you're like look I can't take off  of work you know it's gonna call I just  looked in the flight it's seven hundred  and eighty dollars to go to fucking St.  Martin at that time it's right in season  so that's fifteen hundred just in plane  tickets I know but they can we're we're  their best friends they're gonna be mad  well they fucking started this shit I'm  not I don't want to go to say I don't

[03:34:30]  you're if you book a destination wedding  you're a cunt that's my quote of the week  if you're a woman and you book a  destination wedding you're a cunt the  only thing you're thinking of is yourself  if you're gonna do it don't invite  anybody tell everybody hey we want to  go make our married on our own in this  little island and we're gonna have a big  party we get back I got no problem with  that but when you book that and you want  your friends and some people certain  people whoever can make it to come  you're a cunt no other way around it 
[03:35:00]  all right and people always gonna  remember that they're always gonna be  resentful that you did that to them and  you you took money away from their own  vacation that they want to go on and  now you got to be there with them so  your but your relationship isn't even  that good now you got to be around  them for the next seven days and watch  them be all over each other because  they just got married and you got to  sit there like now there's pressure on  you fuck now I got to hold their hand  and I got to go another romantic

Anthony Channel  on Sirius XM  the Joe Rogan experience  starts now  buckle up, bitches  here we go  where'd you guys go?  you went with Joey somewhere?  yeah  Joey and I did  the Calusa Casino  in Northern California  what part of California is that?  that's  like  it's an hour  from Sacramento  ah  and then we did  McDonald Theater  in Eugene, Oregon 
[03:48:00]  on Saturday  wow  Eugene, Oregon  must have been fun  yeah  they had  snow  like  they had a snowstorm  the night before  and  we were like  yeah  it's fucking Oregon  like they get snow  big deal  we get there  and they're like  we haven't had snow in four years  and we're like  oh wow  because they didn't plow any roads  none  so everything was just  caked over  iced over  that becomes a real problem  I thought it happened  all the time there  do you remember when they did that  in New York City?  when it  snowed and they didn't plow? 
[03:48:30]  well they didn't plow  no  it was a big deal  it was a couple of years ago  it was a couple of years ago  there was a huge thing  where they didn't budget correctly  and they had a big snowstorm  and people were trying to get out  they're like  where the fuck are the plows?  yeah  it's funny  there's certain  you can tell who's set up  who's used to snow  because of  because  solely because of the roads  like when you're in  Minneapolis  and they'd be like  you know  eight inches fell last night  you're like  ooh  I wonder how that'll  you step outside  and you just see  you see black  like they paved it 
[03:49:00]  immediately  you don't see any white  they're just on top of that shit  and then you go like  clearly  we were like  oh you guys  never get snow here  because the road  and then I saw today  people who were at the shows  I went to their Twitter  and they're like  roads are still shit  like haven't done anything  for like three days  it's amazing  there was a video  a famous video  from Oregon  of these people  sliding on this icy road  really  yeah it's a famous video  because  I guess they're just  notoriously shitty 
[03:49:30]  and plowing  because it doesn't snow  very often  they didn't do a fucking thing  this video is ridiculous  it's like 10 minutes long  of people just crashing  into each other  hilarious  just standing there  watching people  come down this road  and smash into each other  dude  the funny thing is  they  the promoter called us  a few hours before the show  and she's like  man we've been getting  a lot of phone calls  of people like  I can't  I'm not  can't drive in this  we're not going to make it  she's like  a lot  I don't know how many people  are going to be at your show  I was like  well I mean  you know  there's nothing we can do  about that  like okay 
[03:50:00]  right  and then  we get there  and there's still  like a great turnout  everybody who came  was a podcast listener  look at this  whoa  look how they're sliding  all over the place  I mean that is fucking ice  that guy can't stop his car  look  look he's just going to  slide in that car behind him  this is ridiculous  is that  you can't stop it  oh shit  boom  and that car's sliding  they're all sliding  the whole thing is ice  that is fucking terrifying 
[03:50:30]  because what to the right  that's water  oh no  yeah  dude that shit is  absolutely terrifying  here's this guy  bridges are a real problem  bridges for some reason  because they're not  connected to the earth  that ground  freezes super quick  so if you're in a place  and it gets  it starts getting cold  and you might be  in an icy rain situation  stay the fuck off a bridge  this guy's like  you fucking  oh my god  look at this thing man  this is crazy  look at this thing  just sliding  what part of Oregon 
[03:51:00]  is this  doesn't say  Portland  that's Portland  yeah  you bitches gotta prepare  for it  okay  this is preposterous  Portland Oregon  frozen rain  is what it is  you can see  on those  like  on that fence  when you can see  that shit that's sitting there  that looks like snow  that's snow  but it's also  a lot of frozen rain  it's like when it gets  to be like 32  just 32  and it was just 33  33  32  34  32 
[03:51:30]  and you get that  horrible fucking  frozen rain  boom  boom  son  shit  yeah  fuck that noise  he's still going  slideways  when I was a kid  when I was in high school  me and my friend  John Jewett  he was my sister's boyfriend  we were on the roof  of the garage  me and him  just sitting there  drinking beer  watching cars  slide into each other  on our street  the best  because people couldn't  I lived on a hill  and no one  you couldn't tell 
[03:52:00]  that it was  total black ice  you couldn't tell  so people were driving  like normal  you know  and then it would just  woo  I lived across from a river  and like when it would  start to freeze  I would get it  and you're close to the water  I guess maybe it's colder  if that makes any sense  but the fucking entire street  just was a giant hockey rink  so we called the cops  and the cops came down the hill  and the cops came down the hill  just bang  boom  they came to investigate  oh we'll see  these guys don't know how to drive  that's the problem 
[03:52:30]  yeah  of course  no the whole thing was a hockey rink  so they got in  and just bounced off the curves  this is a mess  woo  yeah  it was in Newton  Newton Upper Falls  Jesus Christ  yeah  yeah it was  it was horrible  dude  I gotta tell you  Diaz  first of all  he got stopped  in  three different airports  by like  eight different people  this weekend  oh by throngs of fans  you're saying  fans  TSA  were at the airport 
[03:53:00]  and  did they want to check  under his balls for weed  he  first of all  my god  his tolerance  his  it's  stunning  dude  I took a quarter of a bite  of an edible  you're brave  quarter  yeah  I mean the very end of it  and 30 minutes later  I was just  out of my mind  I mean my eyes weren't even open  okay  and I could tell people were looking at me  like they're like  yeah  and you're like  I'm not hiding this at all 
[03:53:30]  like  this is bad  and he ate  of that  he ate  an entire one  like  and then he's like saying  ridiculous shit  like  shit that I  I feel like I get arrested  for thinking it  like I don't  I can't play it back in my head  I was like  dude shut the fuck up  what was he saying  I cannot  I really can't say  the main thing  that he was  I can't  why  it would be  it's not okay  to say  why is it not okay  to say  does it have to do  with ethnic groups  or anything  a lot of them  yeah  so many 
[03:54:00]  racial things  that you can't say  but this one in particular  is awful  I'll tell you  it's so awful  like I can't even spin it  I can't spin a joke  but you know  I have a  and this is  one of the things  that I've been on about lately  I have a real problem  when people get upset  at people that say shit  that they don't really mean  but that it's awful  but hilarious  yeah I agree  I agree  because like  look how hard we're laughing  I was in tears  look at the picture  you guys  I don't even know 
[03:54:30]  what he said  I don't even know  what he said to you  and I'm already laughing  it's so crazy  just thinking about  all the shit he said  to me in the past  of course  of course  well he's going off  about this thing  I'm standing there  I look like I'm going to puke  because I'm laughing so hard  and this is in the airport  and he's around people  like there's  he has no sense  he doesn't give a fuck  he's like  blah blah blah  shut up dude  he doesn't give a fuck  and I have tears  people looking back  and then he's like  TSA  and this guy  in the uniform  looks over 
[03:55:00]  and he's like  you gotta look at this guy  and I'm like  dude I'm all fucked up  don't bring attention  to me right now  and then that guy  he's like  hey Joey Diaz  I'm a big fan  I'm like  are you fucking kidding me  right now  I turn around  and walk away  I was like  I'm leaving  it's you high for this  yeah  I walk away  I leave him  I don't want any part  of this shit  and I go  I buy a magazine  that I leave at the counter  that's how high  I'm like  I want to get this magazine  and then I walk away from it  and I remember like  30 minutes later  before we board  and I go back  and it's sitting there  and I go  that's my magazine  and this lady's like 
[03:55:30]  okay  and I go  I paid for it already  and she's like  okay  like go ahead  and take that  if you want  it's so out of my mind  but then  then we walk by  we go  and a guy  a fucking pilot  comes by  you know  they have like  they always have  that double luggage thing  right  one bag on top  of the other  yes  the pilot bag  yeah  he fucking walks by us  and he's like  hey Joey Diaz  and I'm like  are you serious right now  and he's like  this is my airport  everybody knows me  at this airport 
[03:56:00]  I'm like really  this is my airport  yeah  Eugene, Oregon  no this was in Burbank  he's like  I run Burbank Airport  dog  okay  we then get stopped  in  we land in Sacramento  and people stop him  for pictures  then the baggage handler  stops him  asks him like  a hundred questions  I hate these fucking questions  guys ask way too many questions  okay  so we leave there  well he's super high  can't he just have  conversations with people  then a family stops him 
[03:56:30]  a lady with kids  stops him for a picture  they all take a picture together  like it was non-stop  the best was that  oh this is the best part  so I take the quarter bite  right  and I'm  completely fucking  out of my mind  he eats an entire one  we sit down  on the plane  and he starts talking  I'm like  shut up man  shut the fuck up  I cannot listen to you  right now  because I'm like  shaking  so you told him  to shut up  because you're laughing  too hard  yes  I'm like  I can't hear you talk  shut up  and he's like 
[03:57:00]  he's like  he like looks around  he's like  anyways  and he opens up  a second one  eats the second  of the thing  I have a quarter bite of  so he's on  eight doses  of what I'm on  and I'm like  Jesus Christ  so we go through  this flight  and every time  he looks at me  I still  he goes  oh  and I'm like  dude  shut up  you ever heard  the Duncan story  no  he gives Duncan  a cookie  and then he calls  him an hour and a half 
[03:57:30]  later  he goes  welcome to my world  motherfucker  dude  so  we land  we land  and I  and um  as we're landing  I was like  man  I go  dude  I was  I was  pretty fucked up  man  and he goes  and I look at him  because all I'm thinking  is like  I can't believe  how much more  advanced you are  than me  you know  it's like  like I cannot believe  oh you mean 
[03:58:00]  tolerance wise  yes  like it's like  I can't believe  I ran a mile  and you just ran  40 miles  like that's crazy to me  and we both finished  at the same time  and then I go  so I'm amazed  that he's not affected  I go  I can't believe  how much that  fucking man  he goes  I almost had  three panic attacks  on that flight  I was like  yes  it made me so happy  that he was also  fucked up  and I was like  but he doesn't care  he still goes  right back in  right back in  I go  I'm glad it's starting  to wear off  he goes  not for me  I'm fucked up 
[03:58:30]  right now  yeah his  idea of going  deep is so much  deeper than your idea  yes  he's breaking  world records  on a daily basis  all the time  he's at the bottom  of the Marianas  trench with a shovel  and he's like  there's gotta be  a deeper spot  this is bullshit  and the first thing  he did  as we get off that  was like  let's smoke this joint  I was like  what are you talking about  what are you talking about  man  we're not smoking a joint  I can take a break  he's a maniac  he's a fucking maniac 
[03:59:00]  yeah  well he just goes  through the whole  day like that  and that's where  you know  people would step in  and say  that boy's got a problem  yeah  I'll tell you what  but he doesn't  because for a comedian  it might be the best way  to live life  yeah  scared on a regular basis  and in between  laughing your dick off  scared  laughing your dick off  scared  laughing your dick off  yeah he  he's  the funny thing is  like even his regular cadence  it so  is out of the norm 
[03:59:30]  for other people  yeah  that you see people  react to him  it's more fun  to even watch  people  like at the restaurant  next to us  react to him  than it is  almost to watch him  like he's talking  and I see them  like they're like  Jesus  like this is like  a fucking  it's like you brought  in a pit bull  to have lunch here  you know what I mean  they've never seen  somebody so intense  and animated  and saying these  crazy things  it's like you watch  them react </pre>
