<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of SiriusXM's recent channel renumbering. Opie and Anthony expressed their amusement and frustration with the new lineup, their proximity to Howard Stern, and the accompanying website and app glitches.  Their commentary included crude jokes and sexual innuendo related to the channel placements.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment focused on the killing of Osama bin Laden.  The hosts reacted to the news, joked offensively about the raid and bin Laden himself, and speculated about the potential release of death photos. They discussed political responses, Pakistan's involvement, and the possibility of future terrorist attacks. A caller recounted a sexual encounter with a Navy SEAL. The hosts also mentioned their sleep deprivation from work, with one host mentioning watching a late-night couponing show. A recurring joke involved confusing "Obama" and "Osama."  The discussion returned to the SiriusXM channel changes and another caller's sexual encounter before moving to other topics.

The show then shifted to a discussion of men's physiques and female preferences, segueing into a conversation about Opie's brother's allegedly shady restaurant business, F.H. Reilly's, in Huntington.  They further discussed an upcoming, ambiguously named business venture, "Yankee Cranky," with a suggestive logo.  They then reacted to a preview of a *Taboo* segment featuring an adult baby, finding it bizarre.  A significant portion of the show focused on the death of Yvette Vickers, a former Playboy Playmate, with Opie and Anthony examining photos depicting her youthful beauty contrasted with her mummified state when discovered deceased in her home after nearly a year.  They speculated on the circumstances surrounding her death and the lack of awareness from neighbors.

A phone interview with Canadian author Ian Halperin followed. The interview was largely comedic, centered on the hosts mocking Halperin's inability to recall the Canadian capital, Ottawa, and his defense of Canada.  The final segment covered Jesse James's book, *American Outlaw*, with Opie and Anthony riffing on excerpts detailing James's infidelity and strained relationship with his ex-wife. They also discussed a video of Miley Cyrus performing Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," comparing her dance moves to Elaine Benes' from *Seinfeld*.  The show concluded with opinions on the Miley Cyrus performance and a debate on songs that should never be covered.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't know what you're doing 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  The satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me!  I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now?  Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here. 
[00:02:30]  This is different than any other radio.  Tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show  suspended from satellite radio.  This is why.  This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And Sam.  Every second is funny, wildly funny, and philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  I want to say good morning to everyone that found us this morning.  Yeah, and to all those that didn't, keep looking.  You'll find us.  You'll find us eventually.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Keep looking.  Don't stop.  To those people, they're hearing this a month later because they finally found us.  That'll make sense to somebody.  New channels, huh?  Yeah, apparently new channels. 
[00:03:30]  I got it right in front of me.  So officially, XM 105, serious.  Well, why am I saying that?  Because if you're hearing this, you figured it out.  You figured it out.  But all your presets automatically reset like mine did.  I hit, because I was on, when I started my truck, it was instantly on that info channel.  Right.  With like a 06M satellite radio.  The Bluegrass channel.  The Bluegrass channel.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, they got a special message on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So I hit my preset for this channel, which was 202 at the time, and it went to 105. 
[00:04:00]  There you go.  Yeah, they want us to promote the new channels, but I think that's kind of dumb, because if  you're hearing this, you figured it out.  You figured it all out by yourself.  I don't know how you promote to the people that aren't here right now.  105 and 206 isn't that hard, because, you know, it's like 105, 206, and if there was  another one, it would be 307, 408.  You want me to keep going?  Sure.  509.  I guess the 105 is solid for us.  Yeah, that's apparently a good placement or something. 
[00:04:30]  I guess.  Or something.  It's all the powerhouses of satellite radio kind of grouped together.  Yes, with this lump of shit in the middle.  Well, I guess Howard's on 100 and 101, and we're in 105.  That's not bad.  Of course, there's always got to be separation between the two camps.  It's just ridiculous.  What's 102 and 3?  I ride the elevator with the guys at this point.  It's enough.  Enough already.  Who's, yeah, it's a good question.  Who's XM 102, 103, 104?  Who separates? 
[00:05:00]  Who separates?  Who's the buffer between us and Howard?  Yeah, plenty of buffers.  And then the serious thing, that's just, I don't know.  What's your thing?  Well, we're on 206, because that's the best of XM.  They want to put it all together.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, you got it, Danny?  Yeah.  So we're 105 on XM, and Howard's 100 and 101.  Yeah, he's 100, 101.  Then you got Sirius XM Stars.  See, we should have that spot.  Yeah.  Stars is a channel that's limping along. 
[00:05:30]  Wait, Stars is what?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  They're limping along.  Yeah, wait.  This is going to, I have to.  Stars is 1570.  I can't do it the same way.  Sirius XM Stars.  I'll tell you why I can't do it.  Because I'm typing in 103, because I want to see it with the old XM, but it's not working  that way for me.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll figure it out.  Yeah.  So we don't know?  I'll get it, Miss.  All right.  No worries.  No worries at all.  I'm going to guess Martha Stewart's channel, or Rosie, or Jamie Foxx.  Could be.  Could be.  New channel lineup is fantastic. 
[00:06:00]  It's not a new channel lineup.  New channel lineup.  Isn't that funny?  It's like, wow, this is great now.  I think what the company's trying to do is just organize it better.  I love your new numbers.  I have it all, guys.  Oh, you got it?  Yes.  All right.  So Howard's 100, 101, we're 105.  We want to know who's buffering us.  You got 102 is Playboy Radio.  Ah.  All right.  103 is Spice Radio.  Oh.  104 is Stars 2.  Ah.  And then we're 105.  106 is Road Dog.  Ah.  107 is Sirius XM Stars. 
[00:06:30]  104 is Stars 2.  And 107 is Stars.  108 is Out Q.  Oh.  109 is Cosmo Radio.  What is Stars 2 at 104?  Ah.  It's 10, but then again, 105 is, if you say 105, it's probably a little bit easier to remember  than 103 or 104.  I don't know why it is.  Yeah, yeah.  On the fives and zeros is...  But then you got the big boys, because it's Cosmo Radio, Martha, and Oprah at 111. 
[00:07:00]  Damn.  There's a lot of pussy in that group right there.  Yeah, but not a lot of people who enjoy it.  Absolutely.  You're right.  Oh, wait.  The weird pussy.  Well, the...  Well...  Damn.  I know what you were saying.  I'm tired.  There's a lot of leszing out in those three areas.  Leszing.  In those three channels.  A lot of...  A lot of...  A lot of leszing out.  When they're not doing radio, they're just all leszing out.  Ah, just licking Fox.  No, no, no, no.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just...  Women hate that noise, by the way. 
[00:07:30]  Which one?  I don't know.  Ha-la-la-la.  Flirt-lirt-lirt-lirt-lirt-lirt-lirt-lirt.  All right, so...  We-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  So, channel change has happened, and most people are okay with it.  Right?  Oh, it's fantastic.  I laughed, I cried.  I felt good about me.  The bin Laden news is fading away already, huh?  You think?  I think so.  I think so.  Obama's at ground zero today, though.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Thursday.  He offered an invite to George W. 
[00:08:00]  To join him there as a fucking opening act.  And George W said, no, thank you.  Is that why?  Yeah, it looks like George is an opening act, and...  It wasn't a good gesture on Obama's part?  The motherfucker was responsible for, you know, at least just as responsible for getting  him as Obama was.  At least.  That's probably why he invited him, though.  Yeah.  He knows Bush was president or 9-11.  And he probably knew he wouldn't come or something.  Isn't that a nice gesture, though?  Yeah.  By the president? 
[00:08:30]  Eh, it's all politics.  I don't give a shit anymore.  So you got to spin it and...  Yeah, I got to spin it and say, yeah.  You got to spin it and say it's not a good gesture.  Well, apparently it wasn't to George W. He said, fuck it.  Yeah, but George W. has made it perfectly clear he doesn't want to do anything.  Yeah.  He just wants to retire and stay out of the spotlight.  He has said that many times in the last couple of years.  Well, he wrote that book and went out.  Yeah.  Yeah, he said that was a rare thing, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He went on all the talk shows saying, I don't want to be doing anything political. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and he must be enjoying himself now.  He doesn't want to sit out there and have people spinning shit all over the place, what  every little movement meant when he stood there with Obama and shit like that.  So let Obama do it himself.  So he gets all the fucking credit anyway.  That's how some people are spinning it.  You know, I'm not downplaying his involvement in this, of course, but a lot of people are  really just saying, oh, look what he did that George Bush couldn't do, and that's out 
[00:09:30]  of hand.  I mean, come on.  All that fucking interrogation, all those interrogation techniques that all these liberals  and Democrats were saying, it's horrible, we should never do this.  As Americans, we should never, that's the shit that got the ball rolling.  I think they said Colin gave up Colin.  I used to call him that since we were here.  Yeah, yeah.  Colin Quinn.  Cut the clitoris off and fly two points in.  I'll be getting.  Cut the fucking head off. 
[00:10:00]  Colin Quinn.  Colin.  It's funny.  Yeah.  By the way, can I go back to the channel change for a second?  I just got a nice tweet by a guy I can't even pronounce for his Twitter.  Sorry.  You got to make it simple.  Is it Jerry Schizzerbert?  It's comatose, but I think there's zeros instead of Os.  It's just a mess.  But he sent this along. 
[00:10:30]  Of course, everyone's logo is right except for the virus.  Oh, really?  Is that how it works?  So in the 105 spot, it does say the virus, the Opie and Anthony show and the Ron and Fez show.  But under the logo area, it says sports play by play.  Oh, thank you.  It's the only one that doesn't have the proper logo.  By the way, I've told you the web, somebody in the web department, if you're serious, does not like this show.  Oh, really?  Obviously.  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  How do you get that wrong? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, how do you get that one wrong?  How do you get that one fucking wrong?  Sports play by play?  Is that it?  Is that what the virus says?  How do you do that?  I don't know.  We're horrible at sports play by play.  And this.  But I mean, is that the point?  We try to survive and throw a few sports tidbits out there, but in general, we suck at sports talk.  Yeah.  Although your boy Jeter, I know Ant's a big Yankees fan and he's trying to spin that.  Well, I'm just saying.  You're trying to spin the Obama thing and you're trying to spin the Jeter thing, sir. 
[00:11:30]  No, I'm not.  Jeter's having a shitty year and it's not a slump.  It could be a slump.  Of course it could.  He's batting .250 and he only has two extra base hits.  I know, but it could be a slump.  I'm not saying it is.  It could be.  He has a bunch of singles.  Georgie's been in a slump and he's, you know, he was starting to hit.  I mean.  Yeah, but they were talking about how.  Last night it was kind of a fuck up.  They were talking about how Jeter was a little old last year and should they sign him and all that?  Well, they signed him and he figured, fuck it. 
[00:12:00]  Let me just call it in.  I don't know if he was calling it in.  He wants that 3,000 hit thing, right?  Is he doing badly?  Well, last year at this time he was batting .270.  He's down 20 points.  250 he's batting?  But he only has two extra base hits.  That means he's punching a lot of singles.  He's doing a Rod Carew to all you guys.  He's Rod Carew-ing.  He's just slapping at the ball and dribbling singles through.  He's always fucking, as I say, come to the table. 
[00:12:30]  Come to the table.  And I don't think this year is going to be any different.  He's going through a slump.  Who knows?  Maybe it's one of those things.  He's got to check out what he's doing with his swing.  Maybe adjust something due to his age or stuff like that.  But I think he'll be just fine.  Well, the sport community?  If you ask me.  They're all raising their eyebrows a little bit.  Are they going, ah.  Their eyebrows are raising.  Oh, what's going on here?  Look at Jeter's stats.  Is this just a slump?  I'm saying just a slump. 
[00:13:00]  Still early.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Yeah.  Hey, here's your bullet points on the Bin Laden thing.  Pun?  Yeah.  The bullet point right in his eyebrow.  Point right to his head from the gun, USA, USA, USA.  USA.  He's been raising his eyebrow, too.  I don't think it was a double tap because one was in the chest, one was in the left eye.  Pop, pop.  Can you double tap and get that done?  Oh, I could double tap someone in the foot and in the head the way I shoot in my dumb games.  I suck. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  White House reportedly plans to release the death photos.  A lot of people thought it was happening yesterday.  They're holding that back.  They're still, yeah.  You think they release it before Obama gets down to ground zero tomorrow?  Leon Panetta said it's inevitable that they will release it.  But other people are saying, well, what good will it do?  It's only going to rile up the Muslims to see one of their heroes dead.  But, hey, we had to sit there and look at our soldiers being fucking slung over a bridge and dragged on streets and shit like that. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Yeah, the photo will absolutely be released.  There was one that was released yesterday, and thanks to old Jimmy Norton doing a little detective work.  No, I actually, I got it.  Oh, someone retweeted, yeah.  I tweeted it, and then I asked it because it's fake, and then somebody tweeted me, so I retweeted that.  The original.  I just retweeted someone else's thing.  And we were right behind each other because I tweeted it.  And then someone goes, yo, Jimmy just tweeted that it's fake.  And then I went to your Twitter, and then boom, yeah.  But that one looked kind of good, no? 
[00:14:30]  His head looked a little big.  But it looked kind of good.  Yeah, much better than the other one.  Much better than the other one that people are still sending me.  Oh, I still get that, too.  Check it out, man.  There's no death photo yet.  Check it out.  It's like, no, it isn't.  If you're listening to our voices, what day is it?  Wednesday morning.  There's still not a death photo out there, so don't send me that shit.  And then I clicked on one, and it was a link to fucking Jimmy's show.  It's funny.  But did you see the other one, the last photo of Bin Laden alive? 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  And that was you.  You're in the hoodie-footy, pink bunny suit-looking thing.  It's funny.  I like the people that are having fun with it, that's for sure.  Making us click on shit.  It's hilarious to click on it.  I had to see someone's horrible shit.  I thought that was the death photo.  And they're saying there's going to be a lot of email viruses going around,  because people are going to have viruses connected to something that says Bin Laden death photo.  People are going to be clicking on it, downloading, and getting viruses. 
[00:15:30]  So far, no death photo.  If it's released during this show, we'll certainly make sure you guys know about it.  There's been a couple more of the Osama-Obama mix-ups.  Really?  Do we have any?  You got a good one?  I think Glenn Beck did it twice last night.  Who did the Glenn Beck one?  Oh, new ones.  Yeah, yeah.  Twice.  But he's doing it on purpose.  Well, no, he just sounded confused.  Glenn Beck's doing it on purpose.  He sounded very confused.  He's just a fucking ass.  Go back to Morning Zoo Radio. 
[00:16:00]  He's kind of crazy, that guy.  He's a little nutty.  Does he have a huge fan base?  Yeah, yeah.  From what I hear, it's giant.  But they're all in and believe this guy.  I don't know if you're in and believe it, or you just watch him go like, I got to see  this guy completely lose his mind one day.  Let me ask you.  You lean that way.  Are you a fan of his shit?  I'm a fan of watching because I think he's crazy, and I think someday he will just fucking  convulse on the floor with foam coming out of his mouth on his show. 
[00:16:30]  So, but as far as agreeing with what he's saying, no, he goes way out there.  Yeah.  Like, he writes shit on those blackboards.  I don't know what the fuck he's even talking about.  It's like, what?  Huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  U.S. believes bin Laden lived at Compound for six years now.  So that brings us back to 2004, 2005-ish.  Wow.  Let's call it 2005.  You know.  For six years.  And the fucking Pakistanis wouldn't give him up. 
[00:17:00]  Is that going to cause a problem, you think?  Yeah, a little rift.  That's about it, though, right?  Yeah.  The rift we fucking invaded.  Don't we give their money, too?  Probably.  I think we give them a few billion a year.  We give them three billion a year.  Is it three billion a year we give them?  To keep their government going, because if we didn't, uh...  We have no choice.  Then there'd be some, you know, religious fucking crap government in there.  With a nuclear weapon.  So what?  It's not our problem.  But do people understand that's why...  It might be a problem, but...  Fuck that.  People do understand that's why we give these countries money. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Because they're like, fucking stop giving them money, but it's the lesser of two evils.  Then you get one of those, uh, you know, uh, Muslim religious leadership in there, and  then...  See, that's just the...  The rough thing is having a country like that that has atomic weapons.  Now, what do you do?  Do you...  I know it's none of our business, but the second they get nukes, they're at least nuking Israel.  Then let Israel handle them. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Israel will handle them.  They're not gonna get nuked.  Israel is not like us.  They're not afraid that there's gonna be an impolite backlash.  Yeah, yeah.  They will bomb your reactors.  Get rid of them or we bomb them.  They don't get rid of them, they bomb them.  Not even react as they...  Uh, Pakistan has functional nuclear weapons.  They're known as a nuclear power.  It's not like a...  Officially they're...  They are one of the, you know, nuclear powers in the world.  And, uh, if a fundamentalist Islamic nation formed in Pakistan, they would have a nuclear weapon that they would look at as some kind of fucking, you know, religious weapon to be used against the infidels. 
[00:18:30]  Absolutely.  So that's a tricky situation.  I don't know what my stance is there.  I think, uh, the second you see any kind of, uh, quote-unquote legitimate government like they have in there now, which are a bunch of scumbags, uh, starting to crumble, you'd have to do a preemptive strike on their nukes.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  I think you would.  Well, more importantly, I mean, Bin Laden was there for six years, and they're trying to say they didn't know.  I mean, that's just ridiculous.  Uh, the neighbors are starting to speak up, though.  And what are they saying?  Uh, they're saying, uh, we knew something was going on.  I didn't quite know what.  Right.  It's like Pakistan fortress-type thing that you didn't know.  Near a military base.  Yeah, like what else could it have been in Pakistan?  It's their equivalent of West Point, right?  Yeah.  And then a lot of, uh, military guys retire to this area. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It's like, it seems to be a perfect spot for the guy to be.  Yeah.  A perfect spot.  One neighbor was, uh, Babu.  Oh, Babu.  Babu.  Well, we can play the ball clip, which I think is hilarious today.  Yeah.  Let me just play this cold, and then we'll discuss.  So, uh, Bin Laden could have been there for six years.  Six years.  And said, uh, people were suspicious in the area.  And you get this today. 
[00:20:00]  One family lived just opposite the Bin Laden compound for the last five years.  They told us they knew very little about their neighbors.  The family didn't mix much with others, they said.  They never visited us, and we were never invited by them.  Even local children thought there was something unusual about them.  These kids say they thought it was strange that when they played ball in the area, if it  went over the fence, it was never returned.  Oh, one of those neighbors.  It's, uh, it's the Pakistani version of, uh, the sandlot.  The sandlot. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  There was a big monster behind the fence, and, uh, you can't, you can't get your ball  back.  And that, that proves that Bin Laden's just a monster.  He can't even fucking throw the ball back to the kids.  He fucking, he would biff the ball to them.  Right.  Yeah, it's your ball, and they just throw it up on the roof.  That is always, that was always creepy when you lost a ball and the neighbor never threw  it back.  And, of course, you don't expect a neighbor to be in his backyard at that time, sipping  tea.  But you knew eventually they would throw the ball back when they went into their yard. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  And to never get any of your balls back is just, that's always, has always been a creepy  feeling.  The neighbor's ball comes over my, because they have their basketball.  And you eventually throw them back, right?  Yeah, usually it's a kid, you know, he knocks on my door.  Or, hey mister, my ball, when you're back, you know, I'm like, all right, I'll throw  it over there.  Yeah.  Gotta shuffle outside and get the ball and throw it back.  But that's so funny.  I said the sandlot, and somebody added a word in between sand and lot that fits very well.  They can't help themselves.  That's hysterical.  They just can't help their racism. 
[00:21:30]  Oh my goodness, is that funny.  It just drips out of them.  As soon as they wake up in the morning.  There you go.  Some of you sick fucks.  Wow.  So what do you think about the ball thing?  I think we're speculating fingerprints, DNA, right before the show.  I don't know.  Well, I don't think Bin Laden was the one that was throwing it, would have been throwing  it back.  But it shows they're pretty smart.  Even if it's one of the low-level guys, you know, you get fingerprints on a ball.  If they are suspicious, then you know who that guy is.  I think no.  Then you can start. 
[00:22:00]  No?  I think it keeps the kids from creeping around.  Like, if you start giving the ball back, that's the first level of them maybe trying  to get in if the ball goes over and they don't see anybody, or expecting it, or asking the  guy, hey, what's your name, mister?  Or, you know, just opening up some type of communication and interaction with a neighbor,  even if it is just something as insignificant as throwing a ball back.  It's just step one.  You think the Navy SEALs hit a room that was just filled with balls? 
[00:22:30]  Filled with fucking soccer balls.  What the fuck is this?  This prick wouldn't even give the ball.  That's why they shot him.  He was unarmed, and they're like, fuck you, prick.  You didn't give the kids the ball back.  Tap, tap.  You stupid monster.  You're taking it.  So that's kind of weird.  And this is something we were talking about before the show.  Helmet cameras captured the entire 40-minute raid on Osama's compound.  We all know that.  And we're all just dying to see this video, because you know it was in nice HD.  Oh, there's no...  Helmet cams. 
[00:23:00]  Probably cameras all over the fucking place.  It will look like Call of Duty, or any great first-person shooter, I think.  I would love to see this.  You want a fucking United States government.  You're in debt?  You don't want to tax people?  Put this fucking thing out on a DVD.  Charge $1,000 for it.  Oh, my God.  You're into something.  And you're making money.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Because I would fucking pay to see this fucking thing.  Do a pay-per-view.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  It's just the same suggestion you've heard with the death penalty.  I know.  Are you sure the excuses are pay-per-view?  You know, you want to give the family a rusty tin can lid and let him in there alone five minutes to cut his fucking...  It's our old bit.  You know what they should do?  You know what they should do?  Because everyone has a...  You know what they should do.  You know what they should do, man. 
[00:24:00]  What they should have done was grab Bin Laden's body and drag it through Times Square.  Wrap it in fucking bacon, motherfucker.  And give every family a kick to his head.  You know what they should do?  We'll hit him nine times and then 11 times.  But what would the dash be?  I don't know.  Good one, Chip.  Bring his body to the top of the Empire State Building and drop it head first.  Throw it off, man.  You know what they should do?  You know what they should do.  We're all guilty of it. 
[00:24:30]  I want to say that we all know a guy like that, but we've all done it ourselves, right?  We're all that guy.  Because I would pay money to see that.  I like Ant's idea, and I think it would even be satisfying.  If the video you get, whether it's online, maybe a little Netflix Instant or something nice, right?  Where you get the helicopters landing, you get the whole fucking thing.  The guy's running through the compound.  And like I think you said it before the show, and then they turn that fucking corner and there's Bin Laden.  That's all you would need.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  You know, because maybe the graphic thing would piss off a lot of people.  But if that's where the fucking thing ended, you would have the biggest fucking boner.  That would be great.  I want to see that so bad.  And then that Navy SEAL turns that corner, and there he is.  And it's like his helmet cam just sees him.  There he fucking is.  He makes that threatening move that they said he made because he was unarmed, and then gets shot in the head.  Yeah.  I don't know, scratching his ample nose.  What was he doing?  What do you think the threatening move was that he was doing?  Putting his hands up?  He was probably reaching for a gun taped to the ceiling. 
[00:25:30]  Yes, you know, it could have been.  He is a tall man, and could have reached the ceiling with his hands as he put them up above his head.  He was doing the robot.  That's what a lot of people who don't know Bin Laden, when he got nervous, would do the robot dance.  How embarrassing.  You're doing the robot and just get fucking nailed in the noggin.  While the music from fucking Revenge of the Nerds played with their role dancing.  That was Bin Laden's favorite song.  Do we have that song?  That dumb song from the end of Revenge of the Nerds, right? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But the White House should release that.  Just the running down the corridor, the hallway, whatever you want to call it.  They make that turn, and boom.  If that was on TV, wow.  Without the fucking kill shot.  But they would probably say the national security reasons.  Sure.  They don't want to show what these guys do tactically.  It would kind of tip their hands.  You know, the other thing, they said they grabbed all the hard drives, computers, and all that stuff. 
[00:26:30]  They got a bevy of material, they're saying, whatever.  Yep.  How are they able to go through a compound like that in 40 minutes and get what they think they need?  I don't know.  You've got to think there's just...  I'm just thinking of my own apartment or the house I grew up in.  It would take way more than 40 minutes to try to get anything out of there.  I think they know what to look for.  Any computer, you're obviously grabbing.  But what about hidden panels, maybe? 
[00:27:00]  That's true.  Or drop ceilings.  Or dumb stuff under the mattresses.  Yeah.  I mean, they've got to fucking check all that shit.  They probably fucking tossed the place.  And don't forget, there's 25 of them.  Yeah.  A lot of guys are in there, so...  So maybe 40 minutes is an eternity.  And maybe they did miss a few things, but the computer equipment is key right there.  Because you'd think the 40 minutes was spent just getting Osama, but that could have been the first two minutes.  Right?  Yeah.  And then just ransacking the joint, getting out of there. 
[00:27:30]  And then getting nervous that the Pakistani military might get involved.  Yeah, wondering, what's going on over there?  Right.  It's a little loud.  The Pakistani military would not have shot at U.S. soldiers, though.  Yeah.  And that shit, though, they probably wouldn't know who the fuck was who.  And if they did know bin Laden was in there, I'm not sure if they would even bother going over.  They'd probably just go, look, if that's America and soldiers getting him out of there, we better not even fucking move over there.  Oh.  Because Americans probably would have lit them up. 
[00:28:00]  You'd be pretty happy about it, but that's strange.  Yeah.  Your father would be suspicious.  Wait, the neighbor's giving you money instead of giving your old kickball back?  Maybe they wanted to check the fucking ball and cut it open to see if there was any kind of intelligence equipment in there.  A bug or something.  Or maybe they wanted to just give it to the kids that were fucking living on the compound.  Living in the compound itself.  Right, right.  The kids probably found it most times.  Oh, really?  They probably got ball went over.  Well, there's 38 children and one 6'9 man.  And so here's two Columples, whatever it is those people used to fucking buy shit. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, look at that.  Another missing cruise passenger.  A woman disappears from Celebrity Millennium.  Oh, boy.  The Celebrity Millennium.  An old push-a-row.  And this guy gets out of his pickup truck, starts shooting at police as his truck rolls into a telephone pole.  And then I guess he tries to peel out.  Yeah.  How bad of shots are they?  Well, I think that you could see some shots being fired to the back window. 
[00:29:00]  I think.  Did they get them?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  They had it.  We got that guy.  You got to think.  What a dummy.  Yeah.  And then he traipses back.  He's running on ice with fucking glass shoes.  That was intense.  I don't know what's going on with that story.  Did they kill him?  Sure looked like a lot of shots going through his back window of that pickup truck.  A lot of people are pissed at the channel change.  Now they're coming in because they're starting to wake up.  Oh, really?  Some people can't find us.  Some people, their old units don't get the channel. 
[00:29:30]  More complaints about the app.  I just want to acknowledge that these people are bitching about it every day.  And I don't know what to tell you at this point.  What channel are we on right now, dude?  What service do you have?  I've talked to the guys about the app down the hall.  And I don't know.  I don't know what to do there.  Yeah.  So.  I don't know.  They're aware of it.  Trust me.  We tell them almost every day that a lot of people have problems with the app.  So they threw the ball. 
[00:30:00]  They didn't throw the balls back.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  So, yeah, the helmet cameras, wow, captured the entire 40-minute raid.  Yeah.  President watched it live.  They all watched it live.  I know.  They were able to watch it live like a movie.  Have you guys seen a bunch of the shows that are now doing it where they're just focused  on each individual face?  I said it yesterday, but it's unbelievable to see the looks on these people's faces.  Yeah.  You know they're seeing some shit.  You see Obama's look?  Oh, yeah.  You see all the Photoshopping going on?  Well, the commercial they showed beforehand, there was a commercial for AOL. 
[00:30:30]  It would come on each helmet cam before you could actually watch the ride.  I could just see that.  You're all pissed off.  Somebody photoshopped a nice controller in Obama's hand.  Oh, like he's playing a little Xbox.  And they said he's fucking up some noobs.  Yeah.  So a lot of people having fun with that fucking photo out there.  Pretty funny.  White House now says Bin Laden was not armed during assault yet.  We said that.  Oops.  Whatever.  56.5 million watched Obama's speech about Bin Laden's death. 
[00:31:00]  And the last bullet point today, which is going to piss off Ant, his approval rating jumps  nine points.  Oh, of course.  Well, that's expected.  I love how that happens, though.  Who are the people that, like, one thing happens, they're like, I couldn't stand this guy.  I don't like the way he's handling it.  Oh, that's great.  I love him.  That's just like the stock market.  I don't know.  Up, down one day.  We're all skittish, I guess.  Oh, you found it with the...  That is good.  He's like a PlayStation.  He's got the PlayStation remote.  Face is all intense. 
[00:31:30]  That's funny.  But look at the looks on these people's faces.  They're all wearing the hats.  They're all Obama.  That's great.  There's a bunch of these.  Any good ones besides the remote?  That's a little bit of everybody.  Yeah.  Did you read about the head of Indian Affairs getting all pissed off?  Of course, because they named him Geronimo. 
[00:32:00]  It was codenamed Geronimo.  He wasn't codenamed Geronimo, though, right?  No, that was the nickname for him, Geronimo something.  Why would the Indian Affairs guy not just shut the fuck up?  Who cares what he thinks?  I think it was a woman.  Whatever it is.  Yeah.  Whatever hangs between its legs.  Yeah.  Who cares?  When I used to play basketball and my dad was the coach, we had a very famous play called  Geronimo.  Geronimo.  So it brought me back to a time when I died.  You sure you're saying Geronimo, not my son's-a-mo?  It just meant we're going long. 
[00:32:30]  It was almost like a football play, man.  He would call Geronimo on the sidelines, and that meant I had to fucking race up the  sideline all the way to the other hoop.  Geronimo's always been...  And get a nice long pass.  Yeah.  It's always been one of those kind of, you know, Geronimo.  But yeah, I guess his codename was Geronimo.  I heard it was...  All right.  I heard his codename...  I heard that, too, at first, and then I heard it was a little different.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  But I don't have...  Maybe it was Geronimo on there.  If someone has info on that, please.  They say that Geronimo was an American hero and should not be...  He was the first terrorist.  Why would the Indian guy not just shut the fuck up?  Do you really think that when hunting Bin Laden, they shouldn't call him Geronimo?  You asshole.  They need a name.  So what?  Shut up.  I'm going to call him Nixon.  Yeah.  Who cares?  All right, cut.  We have a...  In our sights. 
[00:33:30]  What do you think of them apples?  Shut up.  The amount of tax breaks you people get, shut up.  Let us use the name Geronimo.  We have casino hang-ah-hang-ah in our sights.  Right.  Shut up already.  Soldier sees him.  Black Jack.  Yes.  We have half of Anthony Kumi's check in our sights.  That's smooth, Jim.  Oh, I got the real picture of Obama.  He wrote Obama. 
[00:34:00]  Kevin from Connecticut, you just fucked up too now, man.  Yeah.  Instead of saying Obama, instead of saying Osama, you said Obama Bin Laden.  I got the real death picture.  There you go.  Oh, it's just X's over his eyes.  That was done in Microsoft Paint.  It looks really good.  That's got to be it.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's just one letter off.  So it's very difficult, the Obama-Osama thing.  Everybody's been doing it.  So you got to say Bin Laden.  That's what I've been trying to do.  Yeah, but to say Bin Laden and then Obama. 
[00:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's just weird.  Obama-Osama.  Who would have thought it?  If you went back to 2001, I think we've done this break.  You never would have elected a guy named Obama.  And someone told you that in the near future, our president's going to be Obama.  Hussein.  Yeah.  Right.  Barack Hussein Obama.  People would go, you're fucking nuts.  Like, really?  Really?  Is that what's going to happen?  You got to go to the funny fucking farm.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  But then-  Oh, see, thank you.  What happened?  This is what I heard, too, Ed.  Chris in Boston.  Hey, Ope.  Geronimo was the plan.  Jackpot was Obama's codename.  Really?  Sure, Jackpot wasn't the plan?  They changed it.  It first came out that Osama was Geronimo, but now they're saying he was Jackpot and the  plan itself was Geronimo.  I don't know if that's true.  I did hear that, though.  Yeah, a lot of people say that.  The operation was Geronimo and his codename was Jackpot.  That's still pissed off some Indians. 
[00:35:30]  Jackpot, though.  That's hilarious.  Jackpot.  So they were going with the casino.  They missed the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And what did they say when they got him?  E- What was the code?  It almost sounded like a Kia.  Like, aha, he's dead.  E-K-I-A.  E-K-I-A, right.  E is killed in action.  Enemy.  Enemy killed in action.  E-K-I-A.  What could E have been?  Why would I think E?  E-Rock.  Yes.  Where they traveled, the E network.  They killed the entire network. 
[00:36:00]  Egbert killed in action.  Or Edgar.  He shot my teeth.  Putting moisture on them.  So what do you think happens next?  It's such a good feeling in the country right now,  but you know there's going to be something  that's just going to ruin everyone's fucking party.  Well, within minutes of the announcement,  I said that you're going to start seeing people in a couple of days  come out and say that the celebrations were inappropriate. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, of course.  Those are already coming out.  I've read a few of those.  But I'm talking about, you know, something happens, unfortunately.  The feeling is too good,  and always when you get this feeling that's too good,  there's always something right around the corner, unfortunately.  It just seems to be life.  I think we're more apt to have one of these homegrown  fucking Muslim assholes do something  that have a real international incident,  like 9-11 especially.  I don't think it'll be something that big.  If anything, look out for kooks running into a mall 
[00:37:00]  or a movie theater, shit like that,  with a gun and just shooting up some people.  Mark my word, the feeling is too good.  There's something right around the corner.  I don't think it's a 9-11 type situation.  I'm in agreement with you.  A lot of security Thursday for Obama's trip here to New York.  Oh, my gosh.  Tomorrow.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, you don't want to be downtown, that's for sure.  I think I'm going to go ride my bicycle down there. 
[00:37:30]  Are you going to ride your bicycle down there  and see what the deal is with the dealio?  I visit Ground Zero every once in a while.  It's been a while.  I heard one of the buildings is like 50 stories high now.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah, you pop up pictures of their progress.  I guess I haven't been there in a while then.  I don't remember seeing that last time I was down there.  They're not still calling it the Freedom Tower, are they?  That fucking horrible name.  That reactionary name.  Freedom Tower.  I mean, of course we love freedom, but enough with the word freedom.  60 stories.  Wish we had more of it. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, they showed the video of Inside the Place.  We know that, Ryan.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the video afterwards.  Yeah.  We want the video of the Navy SEAL running down these fucking hallways  and turning the corner, and there he is.  Yes.  God, I want to see that.  You think we'll eventually see that?  Yeah, at some point.  Not anytime soon.  No.  It's like anything else.  Everything gets out, but I think you're talking years.  Really?  Years.  Maybe we'll see something.  I don't know.  I'd love to see it, like, right now.  How many people do you think have seen that video? 
[00:38:30]  How many?  And is there a circle of people that they finally at the White House go,  all right, you've been interning here a while.  You want to see this?  Let me show you something.  Check this out.  How many people do you think?  Check this out.  It's great.  A couple hundred, maybe?  If you're a senator, do you get to see this?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  So are they knocking on doors going, all right, let me see this fucking thing?  Yeah.  Like, who gets to see his secretaries?  Maybe the old shoe shiner?  Nah, I think you're right, though.  You think the White House shoe shiner that's been there since Eisenhower gets to see it? 
[00:39:00]  I love those old guys.  And throw him a bone?  Right.  Yes, sir, Mr. President.  Yes, sir.  You've been scrubbing toilets for 50 years.  Why don't you come on here?  Yeah, come on in.  Check this out.  It's great.  You're going to love it.  That's the shit I always wonder about, that just weird fucking stuff.  Like, who gets to see that video?  You know, the heavies get to, but, I mean, is there other privileged people?  That's got to just be great.  God, just seeing that fucking bashing the shit out of that place.  Cop just coming in. 
[00:39:30]  Gunfire.  You think that'll be a mission eventually on Call of Duty or something?  Ah, probably, yeah.  Someone will reenact that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, someone's going to pop that on a level.  Make it a game level.  Take out Osama.  I was listening on the way in that they had this shit figured out.  They built a duplicate compound.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I didn't realize how much detail.  They said they knew exactly how many feet they needed to run to get back to the choppers way before they did this mission. 
[00:40:00]  All the doors and windows.  A million different scenarios.  Height of everything.  Yeah, they ran through different scenarios, what would happen if this happened.  Imagine a Navy SEAL.  All of a sudden you jump out of that chopper and you go, I know this exactly.  I know this whole place.  I know it like it's my own house.  Yeah.  They train like motherfuckers.  Or imagine the guy would get some Tums across the street from the pharmacy and the helicopter had to wait.  I don't think they would have waited.  No, no.  Probably would have been inconvenient and dangerous. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Imagine.  The helicopter's there and they want to shoot Bin Laden, but the guy giving the orders is getting Tums at the pharmacy.  So he's just waiting like, oh, God.  I would piss off somebody in front using coupons.  They also had some of the older Navy SEALs guys on TV last night.  Yeah.  Saying like they start with over 200 guys and then they graduate with like 20.  Yeah.  They don't want you to quit.  They make you.  One guy was saying they make you think they want you to quit. 
[00:41:00]  But in the end, they don't want you to quit.  But they make it so fucking hard hoping that you understand and can hang in there.  But in the end, man, out of 200 guys, it's usually about 20 that graduate.  I watched a few shows on the SEALs.  And you know they bring only the toughest guys in to begin with.  Yeah, to begin with.  That's what makes that amazing.  I've watched those shows, documentaries on there, and it looks like some of the worst, most uncomfortable shit.  When you just have these lines of guys half in the water, half in the sand, with holding up just giant logs or these rafts, giant logs. 
[00:41:30]  Holding them over their head.  Jimmy just giggled.  Like, they're trying not to fall asleep as these guys are just dumping shovelfuls of sand down their back and making them roll around, pick the thing up again.  Just like stripes.  Jump in the water.  It's freezing cold.  Jump out.  Yeah.  It just looks like some of the most uncomfortable training ever.  Horrendous.  Yeah.  And then this Team 6, half of the SEALs who go out for Team 6 don't make it. 
[00:42:00]  Like, that is a 50% dropout rate.  That's like the motherfucker of the motherfuckers.  What could you possibly have to do more?  Like, Noah would get me in that training would be the...  All of it would get me.  Oh, yeah, obviously.  Why am I even trying to sound like a tough guy?  But the thing that would get me the most would be the lack of sleep.  Oh, yeah.  The guys that have fallen asleep are amazing.  Lack of sleep destroys me in my everyday life.  Like, when you guys come in here with no sleep, I don't know how you do it.  I like how you had a 2 last night.  Because those days when I have no sleep, I could barely function. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it was 2 o'clock.  Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.  The lack of sleep is the thing that would just kill me.  I had to stick around and stay up for the coupon show.  Have you seen this fucking thing?  Coupon fucking...  Oh, God, no.  What's the coupon show?  Look, it's the gayest...  I love when you bring this late night TV to the show.  It's the gayest thing ever.  And you had to stay up for it? 
[00:43:00]  But I was compelled.  You were done with Bin Laden coverage and said, I need to watch the coupon show?  Well, I had just turned on the TV upstairs and a channel was on.  I'm not even sure what the fuck it was.  But then I'm seeing this guy and he's saying that he's getting a bunch of these care packages together to send to the troops.  And he uses these coupons and goes to the grocery store and buys shit and then sends it out.  And they got this guy pushing three fucking shopping carts full of shit. 
[00:43:30]  He's got stacks of coupons.  He rings up like $450 because they had to do two separate transactions because he had so much shit.  It wouldn't fit on one register's like one transaction.  First transaction, like $450 and shit like that.  And then he gives the coupons.  He's going beep, beep, beep.  Over and over again.  Like $5.  $5 he had to pay.  People are looking amazed that this guy is like doing that. 
[00:44:00]  And he did it again.  It was like something like $9.  He got like a shitload of stuff like $800 and some odd dollars for like $20.  We all know that.  But that means clipping out coupons.  Who the fuck is going to do that?  This guy was so like anal retentive and a little odd, a little rain man-ish with the numbers.  Like he'd be going, okay, I need this toothpaste.  And you'd think the big economy pack is more, but you could get more if you buy the little one twice. 
[00:44:30]  And then he's just got all the coupons.  He's the guy you would not want to be behind him online.  I know that.  Just buy your fucking toothpaste, please.  But he was buying a fuckload for, you know, the troops.  I mean, that's a nice thing.  But yeah.  And then it's like, so he buys all these toothpastes and it amounts.  It goes, and these are free because of all his coupons.  So he gets that.  He got a bunch of juice things.  And it's like, yeah, all free.  Like 30 of them in a shopping cart doesn't pay anything.  Would you go through that?  No.  You know what?  When you were poor, would you have? 
[00:45:00]  When I was poor, too lazy.  Yeah.  I just would steal stuff.  That was way easier.  Yeah, that's free too.  Than clipping out fucking coupons.  I was watching just going like, I never knew there was a whole thing going on with this.  What do you mean it's the coupon show?  It's like a whole, it's a reality show.  And they get people that clip these coupons and save unbelievable amounts of money.  Follow them around.  See where they get the coupons from.  Where they got their inspiration from.  And then they go shopping.  And the big thing is when they go shopping and how much they could get off of their bill. 
[00:45:30]  My mom was a coupon lady.  Yeah?  To that extent?  Where she was kind of like getting shit for another.  She'd pull out a little purse and just, yeah.  I got a coupon for that.  I got a coupon.  Oh, yeah.  And this guy had it all figured out.  Like he knew the price of shit.  And he'd be like, okay, I got a coupon.  It's double off.  So it's this.  And then you add the rebate to this.  And like, it ends up being nothing.  And I'm there at two in the morning going, I'm fascinated by this.  But I have to go to fucking sleep. 
[00:46:00]  Could you try to do it?  And videotape yourself trying to be a coupon guy for one day?  Oh, I could never.  I could, because I don't want to be the guy.  Like, I pride myself no matter what I do.  If it involves a line, I pride myself on being able to get the transaction done, walk away and look at the line and go, see, that's how it's done.  Right.  What I finally have done, though, is I've become a generic guy, finally.  Really?  Because you get tricked by advertising, especially in the drugstore and shit. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I don't know, like fucking heartburn medicine or whatever.  And you see the one that you know and then the dumb generic one that looks just awful to its left.  It just looks weak.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Weak and unhealthy.  But then you do study the ingredients.  It's the same shit for like half the price.  I don't know.  So I finally ventured into that world.  Because too many people that are in the know are like, it's the same shit.  It really is.  I can't bring myself to do that with certain things.  I'm the same way, but it's something else, right? 
[00:47:00]  Same thing.  Some things you're like, I don't care.  I'll fucking get anything.  Well, if it's cereal or something like that, it's not.  You've got to go with the Frosty Flakes.  Cereal, you've got to go with that.  You've got to go with Tony the Tiger.  You can't go with, you know, sugary flakes.  Right.  No, I understand that.  Food-wise, I don't fuck around with it.  Yeah, you can't fuck around.  But all that dumb drug shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit like that.  Keeping my stool solid or whatever.  I'll fucking go with it.  Will you go with a generic stool solid?  I made that up.  Usually I need a softener. 
[00:47:30]  I need a stool softener.  If you need to know the truth.  Well, a stool softener, like the generic brand, comes in a tube shaped like a cockhead.  And it loosens everything up nicely.  Nice.  By the way, can I apologize?  We get the channels wrong.  I just tweeted Sirius105XM206.  What's wrong with you?  It's the other way around.  But you were saying that Howard's 101 and 105.  Well, he's a fortunate one.  There's a few fortunate people that work here that get the same channel on both platforms.  For some reason, we still don't get that. 
[00:48:00]  No, no, no.  I would have loved to have just been 2-0-whatever on both things.  Who cares when we move down the dial?  How are we only five away?  You're saying who buffers us between us and Howard?  Well, there's 100 buffers.  100 between us and Howard.  Well, let's talk about XM because we live in the XM world.  Oh.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, man.  That's right.  The best of my XM world.  I'll always be an XM guy.  Yeah.  So when I talk about this stuff, I talk from an XM point of view.  Yeah, it makes sense.  You know, the company that was extremely creative and didn't rely on just one or two things. 
[00:48:30]  I remember that those days.  I'm an XM guy all the way to all the people that got fired.  I'll tell you what I am.  I'm a fucking merger guy.  Why?  Because stock went up.  You're Mr. Merger Guy.  I did.  Well, there's some problems around the corner.  No!  What was that FCC thing?  Oh, you don't even want to talk about it?  Okay, sorry.  Oh, boy.  What?  No, no, no.  I want to talk about it.  No, I think Danny's right on this one.  All right.  Whatever it is, I hate that.  He's absolutely right on this one.  I'm sorry. 
[00:49:00]  I'd take that back.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I slipped there.  Sorry.  Oh, here's Megan in D.C.  Now, this is the shit we want.  We need to bring sexy back.  What?  Megan in D.C.  She's a regular.  I recognize her.  What's up, Megan?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen to this story.  Go ahead.  I had sex with a Navy SEAL in the bathroom of a party just because he was a Navy SEAL.  How great is that?  That's great.  Wow. 
[00:49:30]  He just told you he was?  Yeah.  How about you suck my cock?  Walk us through that.  What kind of party?  Did he go in the bathroom?  Where did he go?  Yeah, I was just, you know, I was in the house in the bathroom.  Did you do the old bend over the sink?  Did he have sand on his balls?  I think we're actually on the floor, if I remember correctly.  Do you put his penis in your hiney and then put his arms over his head and run in place while he jammed it up your shitter? 
[00:50:00]  Excuse my language.  And the only reason you did it was because he was a Navy SEAL?  Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.  I just wanted to be able to say that I had, you know, had sex with a Navy SEAL.  That's great.  And he just wanted to be able to say he fucked a girl at the party.  All right.  But they don't tell you that the Navy SEALs don't last that long.  No, they come immediately.  Yeah, that's the other side of that whole thing.  In and out.  No load left behind.  And it just dribbles out.  I said he wasn't especially memorable either way.  Oh, shit.  He wasn't bad.  Because they concentrate more on, you know, killing than fucking. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  He was very muscly.  He was very muscly.  Do you like the muscly guys?  Yeah, he was kind of, he was really lean, though.  He wasn't like a big, you know.  I hear most of you broads don't like the muscly.  They tell us.  Is that what they tell us?  Of course they do.  Yeah.  They love the muscly.  That's why I said it, because I was hoping for confirmation.  A guy with flabby arms and a potbelly.  Dude, I look like an orangutan without a shirt.  I'm sitting there. 
[00:51:00]  I'm like, who wants to fuck me?  Do you just say that to yourself in front of a mirror?  Dude, I say it out loud.  The answer is serious.  By the way, our pal Jim Norton's a jerk, because he photobombed my fucking photo yesterday.  I didn't mean to.  With Guy Fieri.  You're just a jerk.  Guy Fieri.  Women will fuck me as a means, like, to be coming closer.  Like, it's never the goal, though.  Like, a woman never looks at me and is like, I gotta fuck that guy.  It's one of those things that, like, all right, if I have to, I will, for the dinner. 
[00:51:30]  So why don't we do this?  Oh, she's gone.  Damn it.  I want to know if, in general, women don't like muscly guys.  I think they like muscly guys.  Or how big do the muscles get where you don't like it anymore?  They probably don't like, you know, bodybuilder guys, but I think they like muscly guys.  You know, I think they would like to, you know, grab onto a muscly guy, then flabby guy.  I'm sorry, I got distracted.  I think. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, fuck, that is true.  Eastside Paul, thank you.  Huh?  My brother's restaurant, F.H. Reilly's, who I'm a silent partner of.  Yeah.  Trust me, I say silent partner because I don't want to ruin what he's got going.  Number one restaurant in Huntington, just voted.  Oh, wow.  What?  F.H. Reilly's.  Number one restaurant in all of Huntington.  Well.  There's plenty of restaurants in Huntington, too.  That's fucking huge because Huntington has become like a restaurant mecca for Long Island.  Yeah.  Every other fucking storefront is now a restaurant. 
[00:52:30]  Thanks for that, Eastside Paul.  My brother's going to be stoked.  How far is it?  With your strong arm?  Did you pay off?  What did you do?  Break some legs?  Yeah, we got some things.  Did some things?  Got some things accomplished?  Did some favors?  My brother's slowly but surely running that town.  You got some suction in Huntington?  Some suction.  Some traction.  I think he's got suction with the captain.  I told you we bought it upstairs, right?  Yeah.  Renting or buying whatever the fuck.  Long-term lease.  Drug front or whorehouse?  What are you making it?  Thinking Yankee Cranky shop. 
[00:53:00]  Yankee Cranky?  We thought business was going way too well and we need to fuck it up somehow.  That'd be great.  Just like I do on the radio.  The inaugural Yankee Cranky day.  Yeah.  It's going to have that photo of, how do you explain it?  It's always a logo of a woman standing over a guy and it's obvious that she's jerking  him off.  If you look at it the right way.  But it's a massage.  It's Chinese fucking characters but if you squint you can see, oh fuck.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  That's a woman jerking off a guy.  That's a yanking and a cranking going on.  So, I don't know.  Yeah.  Muscly guys, why don't we fucking go to break with that shit?  What do you got?  No, there's what?  Iraq?  Yeah.  Oh, I saw some.  Are you calling the runner in?  Yeah.  You stretching a double into a triple over there?  What are you doing?  Because, you know, he can't hear me so we got to do signs.  I like the signs.  That is a sign I got to be.  You got to watch people who might think it's gang signs and start buck bucking in here. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I know.  That's definitely a problem these days.  Fucking amazing.  Oh, I knew where I was going.  So, you were doing the coupon show.  We got to get into the adult baby thing.  Eh.  I only saw a quick clip of this fucking weirdo.  Taboo, that show called Taboo.  Yeah, I saw that.  You want to play the whole five-minute preview clip?  There's a preview clip, and I think it airs tonight.  I think so.  Yeah, it's the premiere, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people brought this to my attention, this adult baby.  We had one of these in studio many years ago, and they're the real fucking deal, man. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell's going on there.  And he's married, right?  He's got a wife.  I only saw literally a couple seconds and said, oh my God.  That's the weirdest thing, man.  It's just the weirdest, dumbest thing.  I don't get it.  Just like a baby.  I don't get it.  What's wrong with you?  I don't get it whatsoever.  And we've got to talk about the sad end to the 1959 playmate.  What a great story.  Is that what she was?  The 1959 playmate?  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Yvette Vickers, who was really hot.  She was hot in that Attack of the 54 Woman.  Although her eyes are a little too far apart.  You think?  Yeah, if you're going to get picky.  Was she the 59 playmate of the year?  I believe so.  Is that her?  Is that...  I don't look like her.  Yvette Vickers?  If you go with Attack of the 54 Woman.  All right.  Maybe they got her on the paper.  Late 50s, though.  She was certainly a playmate.  Playboy.  We'll see that.  Yeah, that's her.  Yeah, that's her.  Wow. 
[00:55:30]  Damn it.  Damn it!  Color pictures?  Let's see.  Oh my God.  What would you do with that?  Oh yeah, that ain't bad.  Look at her.  Who's that?  Laying on the couch.  That looks like a much newer picture than it is.  That's Yvette Vickers.  That picture's like from the 50s.  Is it really?  Yeah.  What a plump, juicy hiney.  She's a Danny ass.  That's a nasty fucking young Danny Ross hiney.  With the booze bottles all over the floor.  If you didn't know any better, you would think these pictures were taken last week.  Yeah.  They're starting to get creepy. 
[00:56:00]  Let me see her cankles.  You used to be able to look at a picture and know that it was old.  Oh my God, is that...  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I thought I saw a picture of her from like...  Is that her?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Who's that?  Is that her?  That's Warren Haynes.  Oh my God.  That time is a bitch.  Wow.  None of us escaped that shit, huh?  That's bad.  Wow, that's the same broad?  Oh, look at that picture.  Hold on, hold on.  Go, go, go.  Yeah, where's her hair?  Just her face.  Where's she got the hair in her eyes?  Yeah.  Let me see that shit. 
[00:56:30]  I like the face pictures.  Look at that.  Look at this face.  She looks fucking...  You can't see because it's radio.  Yeah, she looks good there.  Her eyes are a little far apart.  Nah, but she got a roundish face for it.  Yeah.  She's fucking hot.  And then, wow, what a tragic end.  We'll tell you what happens next if we haven't heard yet.  Kramer!  It's tough to tease anything these days with this stupid social network.  It really is.  But what the hell?  We're old school with that tease for you.  Yeah, all right. 
[00:57:00]  And, oh, and the adult baby clip.  Yes, stay there.  And now, 99 seconds of Canadian author Ian Halperin defending Canada.  And go.  What's the capital of Canada?  Oh, no, Saskatchewan!  Seriously, anyone here know the capital of Canada?  I honestly do not know.  Come on.  I would guess...  I rest my case.  I rest my case.  I think it doesn't matter.  You know what?  Of course it matters.  Everyone gives a shit.  Every Canadian...  I don't know the...  Every Canadian, when you ask them, what's the capital here? 
[00:57:30]  Because the U.S. is the response.  Because the U.S. is popularly more interesting.  Illiteracy is a problem.  We don't give a shit about Canada.  Illiteracy...  Yes, it is a problem in the U.S.  When we were creating a light bulb to read by.  Right.  And that's...  Ian.  Ian.  That's my point.  You have a Canadian resemblance.  I don't know what your point is.  It's not the entire world.  Step out.  See the world.  Get educated.  I fly everywhere.  I fly everywhere.  You cannot even name the capital of Canada.  I don't care about that.  I don't give a shit about that.  Because we are in business together.  What was the original name of Black Sabbath?  What was the original name of Black Sabbath?  I don't care about the Black Sabbath. 
[00:58:00]  Exactly.  That's how I feel about Canada's capital.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  I'll tell you.  What's Ozzy Osbourne's real name?  Exactly.  But any Canadian will name the capital of the U.S.  Because the U.S.  is what's down here keeping you from getting fucked.  I kept you from getting fucked by communists.  Exactly.  How about...  Communists.  Yes.  Yes.  Dude, I could go...  Russia would have stomped over...  Let me tell you something.  Stomped over Canada for the United States.  I could go to the hospital today, check in, and I don't get an outrageous bill.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  You guys got to go, and you're fucked up.  Wait online.  Wait online.  What's the name of my HBO special?  What's the name of my HBO special?  Dude.  No, no.  You don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not big enough for you just to know that.  That's the way it is about Canada.  We don't look at Canada like that.  We are neighbors in business.  Canada and the U.S.  Stop it, you silly goose.  We have to wrap up.  We got to wrap up, but it's Ottawa.  We all know that.  That was Canadian author Ian Halperin defending Canada unsuccessfully on the O.B.  and Anthony Show.  The virus. 
[00:59:00]  Get in touch with the O.B.  and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at O.B.  and Anthony.  8.com O.B.  and Anthony.  Let's do this.  We got Jesse James coming in today.  He's got a new book out called American Outlaw.  We're just embarrassing each other by putting pictures from our iPhones up on the Apple TV during commercials. 
[00:59:30]  There's some good ones popping up there.  Yeah, we all seem to have horrid pictures of each other.  Well, of course.  You have to.  Of course you do.  Anthony Yvette Vickers.  Yvette.  Yvette.  We were looking at some really nice pictures of her from back in the day, back in the day.  Yeah.  It's too visual, unfortunately.  I know.  It's just funny.  It's funny.  She was a playboy playmate.  Yep.  She was in that movie.  You saw this movie?  Oh, yeah.  Attack of the 50-Foot Woman was a staple when I was growing up, and Creature Feature would play it on Channel 5 here in New York. 
[01:00:00]  Did you star in it?  Yeah.  She was the 50-Foot Woman, right?  Yeah.  And she was also in Attack of the Giant Leeches.  Did you see that one?  That one I missed.  A bit of a drop-off from Attack of the 50-Foot Woman.  Well, what do you do after Attack of the 50-Foot Woman?  Yeah.  She was pissed off because her husband was a little philanderer and stuff, and she wound up growing to be 50 feet tall through some radioactivity or some bullshit. 
[01:00:30]  And she was chasing after him, finally caught him and threw him or some shit.  Didn't they try to remake that movie?  I want to say like Daryl Hannah.  Daryl Hannah.  It was Daryl Hannah, right?  Yeah.  That sucks.  They just couldn't get it going.  Well, we go to Los Angeles.  Yes.  Dateline, Los Angeles.  This girl was fucking beautiful, a playmate.  Fast forward a bunch of decades, and this is what happened to her.  Yikes.  The mummified body.  Oh. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, you don't want to be that.  A former playboy playmate who once starred in the cult film Attack of the 50-Foot Woman was found in her Los Angeles home.  She was 82, man.  82 years young.  And I believe we saw a picture of her looking 82.  Looking every bit of 82.  Right after we were looking at her hot Playboy pics.  Yeah.  And then we went to that, and wow, what a drop-off.  And all that is is a few Christmases.  That's it. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That's how I keep track of time.  50 Christmases for her.  Bunch of Christmases go by, and that hot 1959 playmate is your grandmother.  Oof.  She was discovered by a neighbor in an upstairs room of her home.  She had not been seen for a long time.  Oh, boy.  So finally they decided, why don't we take a look inside and see what the fuck's going on.  Yeah.  She may have been dead for close to a year.  Wow. 
[01:02:00]  See, if you live long enough, this is how it ends.  Yeah, because everyone else you know is dead.  Right.  So you're just kind of alone.  Right.  And you could be missing for a year, and no one will even know.  But what does it matter if you're dead already?  Does it really matter in the end?  It's kind of creepy, the thought of her just dead day after day.  The sun comes up.  The sun goes down.  Leaves a little shadow across the floor.  She's just laying there.  You think there's that sun movement that just goes up? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It goes up across her dead eyes.  It goes up across her dead eyes.  Day after day for a year.  And then it's pitch black.  Every once in a while, a fly lands on her.  Yeah, but she was mummified, so she's just laying there.  Wow.  Look at that ass.  Look at that ass.  Was that ass mummified?  Man.  Damn.  She might have been dead for close to a year.  Neighbor Susan Savage.  Way to go, neighbor.  Oh, boy.  Those savages.  The stupid savages didn't know what was going on.  No.  We've all been crying about this. 
[01:03:00]  Nobody should be left alone like that.  Under the photogs?  Absolutely crying?  Oh.  Sorry.  Absolutely crying.  That's terrible.  Anything, Iraq?  Anything?  That should be on a hot button at this point.  Oh, I know.  It's fantastic.  You got Schmidt now.  This isn't a Schmidt situation.  No, it's not a Schmidt.  This is not a Schmidt situation.  The neighbors are just absolutely crying over here.  Yeah, the neighbors are basically saying no one should be left alone like that.  Well, how about you fucking go over there with a pie every once in a while? 
[01:03:30]  You're the neighbor.  You're the neighbor.  You're the one that was supposed to be the one that goes over there.  Being a neighbor has responsibilities.  Yeah.  Your family is number one.  Number one.  And then your neighbor is number two.  So if the family's not around, it's your job to go over there and check every once in a while.  If you see that pile of mail and that pile of newspapers on the front stoop.  Never a good sign?  It's never a good sign.  What about it?  It means, wow, her career is going really well and she's overseas filming and forgot to tell the mail to not deliver. 
[01:04:00]  Or the lawn gets a little long.  The lawn gets a little long.  And the house, maybe a gutter falls down and it never gets moved.  All of a sudden the shutter kind of falls askew.  Yeah, yeah.  It never gets fixed.  No, you might want to check.  So the official cause of death has not been determined, but police do not suspect foul play.  Of course not.  Yeah.  And then they give her credits, but she was mummified when they found her. 
[01:04:30]  Mummified.  Does that mean no smell?  A year.  I think so, right?  How long does a body smell before it gets mummified?  I don't know.  It depends on the heat, I guess.  It gets mummified.  Yeah, I think it's all dried out and everything.  So it was probably somewhat of a smell.  I can't imagine no smell.  Yeah, but he's in there going, hey, she's calling a mummy or something.  I doubt it.  Yeah, you know what?  Let's go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, boys.  Hey. 
[01:05:00]  Didn't anybody notice that the lights had not been turned on and over?  You know, who paid her bills?  Hello, bills.  Ducks have bills.  Buffalo bills.  Well, the bill people will just turn all your shit off, so that doesn't matter.  Yeah, that doesn't matter.  So maybe all of a sudden the neighbor saw that light bulb finally go off, but that was the  lighting company turning off the electricity finally.  I heard it was a matter of the newspapers and mail and cobwebs on the mailbox and stuff. 
[01:05:30]  And somebody came walking up.  I believe it was a neighbor saw through broken glass because the house had started becoming  really run down.  Looked through broken glass, saw his blonde hair, and then realized it was a wig.  One of her many wigs.  Yeah, the envelopes were yellowing and everything was kind of getting old.  And then decided to call the police.  Wouldn't that take more than a year?  Nah, I don't think so.  For your house to start looking like shit?  Yeah, you don't do anything to your house for a year. 
[01:06:00]  And it'll look kind of fucked up, I think.  But yeah, especially with mail and newspapers and stuff being delivered.  And the police went in, I guess.  She's dead.  She's dead.  She don't look too good.  She's a mummy.  Yeah, but that's how it ends for another Hollywood B-movie actress.  Beauty, look at that.  Playboy beauty.  That shot is so...  That is a fuck her in the ass picture right there. 
[01:06:30]  That would have been so fucking spankable growing up.  Yeah, her records are thrown on the floor like, let's just listen to some records.  Yeah, let's listen to some music.  I got a bottle of wine.  Do you mind if I take my pants off while we listen to Zeppelin?  Yeah, I'm going to just take my pants and panties off and lay here on the couch.  You could come over and, you know...  Hey, are you wearing your shirt?  I want to wear your shirt.  Yeah, yeah, I'll wear your shirt.  And you could just stick your schnoz up my asshole.  The record's just thrown around. 
[01:07:00]  A glass of wine and an ashtray because she's smoking.  She's even leaning over to put an old track on.  Yeah, yeah, she's putting a little bit of that on.  Probably pericomal.  A little pericomal.  Do you think she's got a pelt if you turn her over?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  That's craziness.  Down the fucking upper thighs.  Oh, she got a big ass bush.  There was no shaving.  It wasn't allowed.  I think evolution has taken away that...  The hair that goes down the legs now. 
[01:07:30]  You think it is?  Yeah.  For the most part.  In the last 20 or 30 years, if they let it go, it's not growing down the sides anymore.  Yeah, you can see when some stubble grows in, if it's out of hand or not.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah.  Found it all stiff.  Are you humming over there?  I love to hum.  I'm glancing through just Jesse James' book because we got them late yesterday.  Yeah.  Why do we always...  We can't read and do a radio show at the same time.  But it looks fucking great.  If we had this last night, we could have kind of perused it a little bit. 
[01:08:00]  Well, there was no one in the mailroom.  It might not be the book company's fault.  There was no one in the mailroom here or something.  All right, let me see...  The mailroom, my favorite place.  I judge every book by pictures.  I judge it by its cover.  And I'm not a fan of all the pictures being thrown in the middle of a book, by the way,  which he has done here.  Okay, why do they do that?  I like when they're just spread around the entire book.  Because then all of a sudden you're on page 17 and it pops to page 21.  You didn't have to read anything.  That's a great feeling.  I like that too.  But they do that for cost probably because all the pictures are the same type of paper 
[01:08:30]  in the middle.  Oh, really?  Is that how that works?  I'm guessing, yeah.  Yeah, I guess logically that makes sense.  So far, so good?  I love it.  I really do.  We have him in today and I'm not just saying that because he's in.  But the opening chapter is about paparazzi.  And I feel myself getting angry fucking reading it three sentences in how much I hate these  people.  And apparently he's very open about his infidelity and stuff.  So, you know, everybody knew about it. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, he's got to be at this point.  You know how people are, though.  They don't like to, you know, they don't want to talk about the interesting thing.  You're like, ah, you know, it's in the past.  You wrote a book about it.  Yeah, I know.  It does get annoying.  I'm just looking at pictures too.  I'm reading.  Kid Rock.  See, right here, page 235, apparently Janine said arching her eyebrows.  Ooh, that's what I do.  I tease.  Let me do that. 
[01:09:30]  James, Johnny Pinesse whispered, I hear Zook wants another shot at you.  Mm-hmm.  You got one in.  That's a good tease.  What does that mean?  Just for a while, Mom, I assured her, just till I get my shit together.  I got a better one.  Yeah?  Listen to this one.  Janine, I said stiffly.  He really says that.  I really don't think that's a great idea.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  I'm thinking right in the old shitter. 
[01:10:00]  You got one, Jimmy?  Janine, stop it, I said, screaming, stepping closer to her.  She whirled and picked up a large stainless steel knife from our cutting board.  Don't fucking touch me, she screamed.  I will cut you wide open.  No way.  That was a legitimate Lulu of a sentence.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's had some great ones.  Yeah.  This Janine does not sound like a fucking charmer.  I'm going to do everyone a favor and read the last sentence of the book. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, I don't know about that.  Why?  Last sentence of the book says, my foot presses down on the gas pedal a little more.  I blast through the desert, wind whipping at my face toward home.  And how does it begin?  That's the end of the book.  I want to see how it begins.  I didn't give anything away with that.  No.  Okay.  Here's how the book begins.  Oh, shit.  It's him. 
[01:11:00]  Get ready.  Get ready.  Perfect.  He really does this Jesse James thing on the back cover, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  He's got the little bowler hat on and the...  Is that what that's called?  The 45.  How do you know that?  I don't know.  Wow.  History.  Who's that?  Naked on our screen.  Oh, well.  What have we got here?  Is that...  Who is that?  It's his ex-wife.  That's a chick with a knife?  That's Janine? 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  God damn it.  Oh, she was the porn girl?  All right.  Wow.  All right, listen.  We got all the things to do.  He put his wee wee there.  I fucking hate crazy chicks.  Crazy people in general.  Oh, yeah.  Crazy chicks are crazy.  Who likes them all?  I don't know.  Jimmy just goes like, no.  I guess there's a few people that like them.  You think with my past record, I do.  You like crazy chicks, right?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:12:00]  They're not crazy like when I first talked to them.  When I was dating, I didn't mind throwing in a crazy chick.  I didn't mind it.  I've noticed they're all crazy, though.  Well, they are.  They're all sisters.  It's a weird thing.  An old friend of mine used to go, they're all sisters.  They're all pink on the inside.  Right.  Having a crazy chick every once in a while is not bad.  Oh, yeah.  As long as you knew how to get rid of them.  Once in a while.  It's been since 1976.  One after another for you?  Oh, it's never stopped. 
[01:12:30]  Never.  But do you adjust knowing that?  No.  Really?  I throw my line into the same pond every time.  That's what I do.  Yeah.  I was like you and I dated a lot of women that didn't have fathers.  Yeah.  And then guess what?  I said maybe that's the problem here.  So I started dating women that had fathers.  I don't want to deal with them either.  Well, you're the same age.  Well, yeah, that's true. 
[01:13:00]  Not like you're fucking called junior by your father-in-law.  We're close in age, that's for sure.  But have you had a situation where you're older than the father yet?  Nope.  Close?  Yeah, a couple.  Not close where it's like, wow, counting months or anything.  Yeah.  Close enough.  If he was around, but they're not, which is good.  Like that.  Where's the adult baby clip?  We want to play that today.  Ah.  And also, is it worth playing the Miley Cyrus? 
[01:13:30]  I heard this damn thing.  Visually, it's hysterical because as Travis pointed out, she is doing the Elaine dance.  And she's singing Nirvana?  She's doing the kick, the thumb kick dance.  Yeah, Miley Cyrus did Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Yeah.  And someone put together the Elaine Bennis.  I've heard worse, you know?  I don't think it's that bad.  As far as covers go, like the American Idol guy was a lot worse. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  In my opinion.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm a Nirvana fan.  I didn't think it was that bad.  The second I saw this video, I said, why did she dance like that?  It's hilarious.  And then they keep cutting back to Elaine at the party doing her dumb kick dance.  It really is.  Oh, that's great.  George's face.  For her to come up with that dance was brilliant.  Right.  That fucking dance is the dopiest looking thing ever. 
[01:14:30]  Travis, we should tweet that today.  That's good.  Absolutely.  Miley Cyrus versus Elaine Bennis.  I'll send you the link, but it's also on What Would Tyler Durden Do?  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Our pal over there.  WWTDD.com if you want to see this video that we're laughing at.  Yeah.  But here's the audio.  We'll play just a little bit of this.  Miley Cyrus doing Smells Like Teen Spirit.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:15:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:16:00]  I wasn't feeling that.  Nah.  I wasn't feeling that, yo.  She's got to do a better job than that if you're a big star, right?  A big star. 
[01:16:30]  If that's a local band doing it, not bad.  It's not good, but it's not terrible.  I don't know.  The beginning part, the chorus, you know, she was able to hit the notes.  She just shouldn't be singing it to begin with.  Yeah, yeah.  She shouldn't be singing it.  There's a few songs out there that you just shouldn't try.  I think that's one of them.  Yeah, definitely.  You know what I mean?  It's so iconic that.  Yeah.  Is there a short list of songs?  We don't have to make an official list, but is there a short list of songs that you just  should not do?  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Oh, my God.  Perfect. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, that's iconic.  Leave the Bay City Rollers alone.  Yes, yes.  If only they could do it.  Smells Like Teen Spirit seems to be one of those songs.  I'm trying to think of another one.  Could you do Stairway to Heaven?  Yeah, that's kind of...  A staple for a lot of bands?  Yeah, yeah, you can.  It's weird.  It's got to be like...  I really believe Smells Like Teen Spirit is one of those you should just leave alone,  but I guess I can't think of any other ones off the top of my head.  Unless you're really cool.  Huh?  Then you could do it if you're really cool.  Who could do it, though, and where people go, okay, that was all right. 
[01:17:30]  You know what I mean?  What artist could do Smells Like Teen Spirit?  Eric is suggesting we get broadcast to try and do it.  Don Wicklund.  Oh, Donnie.  Donnie Wicklund?  Yeah, Donnie Wicklund.  Does he do Smells Like Teen Spirit?  I don't know.  Maybe he could give it a shot.  I would say... </pre>
