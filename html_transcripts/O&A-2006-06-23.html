<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and highly offensive humor, insulting themselves liberally.  They boasted about their superior ratings in Boston,  crudely comparing their success to the failure of a rival show, "Mantown," and its host, Hillman.  Norton then regaled the listeners with a hilariously disastrous dating story involving actress Kate Beckinsale, detailing the scheduling mishaps and ultimate stand-up.

The show transitioned to a discussion of their own burgeoning success and the subsequent attention from their bosses at CBS and XM, who were vying for their favor with extravagant gifts and dinners, including an invitation to Derek Jeter's charity event.  Opie's ongoing battle with a rodent infestation in his apartment and his subsequent search for a new home provided further comedic fodder, complete with graphic descriptions of his pest control efforts and frustrations with his landlord.  The conversation concluded with more self-deprecating humor and promotion of upcoming events, including a Korn concert featuring ticket giveaways and a planned appearance by Jonathan Davis.

The next segment covered Roger Clemens' return to baseball, the US's World Cup elimination (accompanied by mockery of soccer), and a listener letter highlighting their inclusion in the World Almanac due to a large FCC settlement.  The conversation then veered into online funerals, sparking darkly humorous commentary about potential mishaps.  This segued into a discussion of online videos of high school girl fights,  with the hosts suggesting their inclusion in their upcoming comedy tour.  The hosts debated the offensiveness of the word "fag," in relation to Ozzie Guillen's recent fine and sensitivity training.  Further morbid humor arose from news stories about a stalker hiding under a woman's bed and a subway "Operation Exposure" sting targeting indecent exposure.  The segment concluded with promotions for their comedy tour, a chaotic ticket giveaway for the Korn concert (resulting in tickets being strewn across the studio), and discussion of the "News Tease Hall of Fame," featuring sensationalistic news teases.  A planned call with Jonathan Davis and a surprise party for "Big A" were also mentioned.

A significant portion of the show focused on evaluating "scary news teases" for a potential Hall of Fame segment, utilizing highly offensive language and descriptions while polling listeners for feedback.  The teases involved various disturbing scenarios, including death and violence.  A phone call with Jonathan Davis of Korn followed, during which he discussed a recent health scare, the band's history, the departure of a born-again Christian band member, their upcoming Family Values Tour (featuring Deftones and a Japanese band described as "psychotic"), and touring with Ozzy Osbourne.  Musical preferences were also debated, with Jimmy expressing strong dislikes.  The segment ended with another chaotic Korn ticket giveaway outside the studio, resulting in a described "mob" scene.

A segment was dedicated to reading and discussing an FCC list of unacceptable words and phrases, leading to numerous sexually explicit jokes and discussions.  The hosts contrasted their recent ratings success with that of David Lee Roth.  Listener calls, both positive and negative (including a heated exchange over autographs), followed, interspersed with audio clips from a married radio team, Eric and Kathy, whose on-air dynamic and personal lives were discussed with vulgar and sexually suggestive language.  Listeners called in with their opinions, resulting in more sexually explicit jokes and conversations.  A listener's account of a “silly accident” involving his father and masturbation was played and discussed.  A listener also threw an XFL football out the studio window.

The final segment featured various callers, including one inventing a giant pool skimmer with William Shatner's picture, Jake (hoping O&A would destroy other Chicago radio shows), Murph the trucker (recounting a darkly humorous accident), and Jersey Dave (praising O&A while insulting Howard Stern).  Topics included a "mob scene" video, an interview with Eric and Kathy, listener compliments (some sexually suggestive), and upcoming interviews with the Washington Post and the New York Post.  The show concluded with playful banter, the repeated chanting of "O-N-A" and "Run," and Jimmy seemingly sleeping during portions of the broadcast.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the use of highly offensive and sexually explicit language was pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Ovi.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Well, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday! 
[00:01:30]  Friday!  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  That's an attention.  For some reason or another, you sound a little taller on radio. 
[00:02:00]  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  With that, let's say hi to Boston!  Hi, Boston.  Oh, my God.  Boston.  We're still not awake, but we're awake enough to thank Boston for yesterday.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Boston.  Yeah, just amazing.  Early ratings are in for Boston.  We're on WBCN.  And, uh, wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[00:02:30]  Really something.  Gotta thank you, people.  Tuning in.  Listening to the show.  Love you.  Yeah, without getting into the details, because we'll board the rest of, uh, America.  Boston gave us great ratings yesterday, even though it's very early on in the game.  Yeah.  We still had to, like, share ratings with David Lee Roth, unfortunately.  But when you break it down... 
[00:03:00]  Break it down.  When you break it down, it turns out we did, uh, unbelievably well.  And, uh, I'm sad to say that, uh, we're already beating Mantown.  Mantown, yeah.  We're already beating Mantown.  For the, uh, month of May.  When we, uh, you know, came swooping in.  That was quick.  It took a month.  Took a month to take out Hillman.  Wow. 
[00:03:30]  And, uh, our numbers just, uh, blow them away.  Thanks for the competition, Hillman.  It was great.  It was nice knowing you.  We gotta start moving on to bigger and better things in Boston.  Who are we gonna make fun of next in Boston?  But nothing could be as fun to make fun of as that Mantown thing.  Yeah, I know.  The Mantown thing we'll continue to make fun of.  It's just taken off.  Like, everybody wants to talk about how completely faggoty it is.  You know, when you're a mediocre talent in a small radio market like Mantown, it's always nice to have true radio professionals in a major market dissect your career. 
[00:04:00]  You know the reality that you've been just rotting in Worcester your entire radio career.  Discuss your talents.  Hillman is the king of the ass kissers.  Give you advice.  Keep rotting in Worcester, Hillman.  You know what the deal is.  And letting you know how your coworkers feel about you.  To this day, the people around him know that he's a joke.  Well, let's just hope you signed a long-term contract in Mantown because you're going nowhere fast.  Oh, they're all just fat bastards. 
[00:04:30]  Ah, yes.  Got a lot of aggressiveness in that promo.  All persons 12-plus, we kick their ass.  Yeah.  All persons 18-34, kick their ass.  Yeah.  25-54, kick their ass.  Yeah.  Men 18-plus, kick their ass.  Yeah.  It was a whomping. 
[00:05:00]  We've only been on 30 days.  30 days.  As far as the ratings go.  And believe me, before that, they were really romping BCN in the morning.  Yeah.  David Lee Roth was there.  Yeah.  So, well, glad you had a couple of months of fun there.  Must have been fun.  It's over, Johnny.  Must have been fun to be in the limelight thinking you're the next, like, Howard Stern or something.  You're nothing.  That's why it must have been so easy.  You're nothing.  It must have been so easy for a lot of these guys out there when David Lee Roth came on 
[00:05:30]  and just, like, drove every listener away to go, wow, I think we're really good.  We rule.  Look at our numbers.  All we needed was a little light on us.  There's something to listen to.  That's all you were.  You were a distraction.  You were a little distraction.  Until CBS figured it out.  You were a fly in someone's face for a minute.  Right.  And then you get attention until someone goes, get out of here. 
[00:06:00]  And that's it.  You think they went to some local bar when their ratings came out, like, three, four months ago, and they're celebrating.  Celebrating.  This is just the beginning.  Look at us.  Yeah, look at you now.  Look at you now.  And Preston and Steve in Philly, same thing is happening to them.  Yeah.  They're freaking out.  So enjoy.  Enjoy.  Enjoy while it lasts.  All right.  Well, thank you, Boston.  We greatly appreciate it.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:06:30]  We got a very, very busy show.  The Mantown calendar.  Don't do this.  Why do they do this?  Why do they make it so easy?  I just don't get it.  Is this?  It's just corny.  Is that a girl?  Eee.  I don't know.  What month is this?  This doesn't even look like a girl.  Can we throw this on our website?  It's not even a month.  What is that?  May, I guess.  Oh, May?  How do you know it's May?  Maybe a boy. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe a girl.  Here's something.  When you make a calendar, like, maybe put the month on.  It doesn't matter in Mantown.  Oh, there it is.  Every day is the same.  It could be July.  A little pain.  Oh, there it is.  They try to put it across her face.  Oh.  Was it May, really?  Yeah, it was May.  It was May, yeah.  That was Jimmy's little joke.  I should have said July, because then you lift up a dress and go, hey, July.  Hey, July.  It's not a girl.  Anyway.  Screw the Mantown thing for now. 
[00:07:30]  We've got to get into some other things, like Jimmy's date last night.  Hey, hey, hey.  Now, Jimmy tried pulling some shenanigans by saying yesterday he wasn't sure if his girl,  his little lady friend, Kate Beckinsale, was going to show up last night or tonight.  But he knew it was last night.  He just didn't want a lot of people showing up, interfering with him, trying to C-block  him.  Well, let me tell you something.  I was going down to the cellar tonight. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Check it out.  I thought it was.  I actually, I wasn't 100% sure, but I did assume it was last night.  Well, I want to know everything.  What a faggot.  So, Kate Beckinsale met Jimmy Norton on Leno when Jimmy was doing Leno last week.  Yep.  She said that she's going to be in New York soon and she'd love to check out Jimmy as  he does some stand-up.  Jimmy gave her the digits.  Yeah.  The digits.  Jimmy, when he's, you know, hanging out, he does the comedy cellar almost every night 
[00:08:30]  in New York City here.  And so then there were some, there were some communiques going back and forth between her  people and Jimmy personally.  Jimmy personally, because he has no people.  Because he has no people doing that for him yet.  And I guess a day was set up, which was last night, that she was going to come down and  see Jimmy perform.  And Jimmy tricked us all and said it was going to be over the weekend.  And now I was telling Jimmy yesterday, this Kate Beckinsale sounds interested in some  way, shape, or form.  And that after the show, you do your set, you go down to say hello to her, meet her, 
[00:09:00]  whatever, that he should then ask her what she's doing the rest of the night and maybe  go out for a cup of coffee or something like that, just to get the ball rolling between  you and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  Now, I'm not even looking at you because I don't want an expression to ruin it for me.  I love these stories.  I want to know exactly what happened every step of the way from the time you found out she  was showing up last night until you went home alone with your hand. 
[00:09:30]  I just want to know what happened.  Well, I got the call.  Today's Friday.  So I think it was Wednesday afternoon on Wednesday.  Wednesday.  I got a call from a message.  Hi, this is so-and-so.  I'm Kate's assistant.  And she mentioned she wanted to come see you.  So she was going to come see me Wednesday night.  So I arranged it all.  I had late spots.  I forgot to call in the Comedy Cellar.  I was in L.A. doing Leno, which usually you call in Tuesdays.  So I had really late spots.  I'm like, oh, man, I don't want her to have to come late to come see me. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Because she's probably doing press for the, I think, yeah, I'm saying the movie she's in.  So I call last night.  It's a big nightmare for me to arrange this, to go from 1130 to like 940.  Because she has to switch a bunch of crap.  But I go through it.  But you have to.  Of course I do.  Yeah.  I don't know who she's going to bring with her.  But the assistant says you might want to save it for like three people, four people, just in case.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  She might bring the assistant.  She might bring a friend.  She might bring her husband.  I think she's married.  I don't know.  But all I read about in the papers is how her marriage stinks on ice. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  It's on the fritz.  She just got married, I think.  On the fritz.  As a matter of fact, there was a quote in the paper yesterday where a reporter walked up to her and said,  well, here's the happy couple, something like that.  And she turned to the reporter and said some snide remark.  That's a surprise.  Yeah.  She goes, oh, that – she goes, yeah, you look like the happy couple.  And she turned to the reporter and said, oh, that's a surprise.  Like, you know, they're not happy.  They're just out doing something probably that they have to do. 
[00:11:00]  So on the fritz.  Anyway, Jimmy, continue.  Sorry.  No, no.  It should be good.  It's good to fill people in on the back story.  Yeah, a little back story.  Back story is always helpful.  Mm-hmm.  Radio 101, they told me in the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Right.  And so I'm like, all right, I'm all set up.  It was kind of a pain in the ass, but I'm like, not a problem.  You know, she's lovely.  I had a call back a couple hours later from the assistant.  Look, Kate has to get up.  I told Kate about setting everything up.  And Kate said, look, we have to do press really early. 
[00:11:30]  She was getting up like 6 o'clock yesterday morning.  She's like, is it possible we can just switch Thursday?  That's a little bit easier for her.  I'm like, you know what?  Sure.  Yeah.  That's not a problem.  No.  Oh, my God.  Huge problem.  No.  No, no, no.  Because you already switched times around and stuff, right?  Yeah, so I called Keith Robinson, who's the one guy I actually switched with.  And he screamed at me, make up your mind, stupid.  But he's like, you know, he didn't care.  Yeah, I kept the spot because he wasn't able to get in in time. 
[00:12:00]  So he switched with me again last night because he's a good friend.  So I switched the spot.  It's kind of a pain in the ass again.  Of course.  And I called the assistant because I hadn't heard from her.  I figured, you know, maybe we did our little radio thing yesterday and I didn't hear from  the assistant.  Oh, no.  You thought we blew up your spot?  Yes.  I called the assistant.  You think in our hotel, she's like, well, he's on this radio show.  I want to.  Let me tune it in.  Let me tune it in. 
[00:12:30]  So, Jim, what are you going to do with her?  Right.  So I called the assistant.  And I'm like, hey, it's Jim.  You know, Kate was going to come tonight.  So I wanted to see how many seats you needed.  Oh, you desperate guy.  You call her.  Remember me?  I'm Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Norton, the comic.  Yeah, we, uh. 
[00:13:00]  Calling about the seats.  Just calling about the seats.  Courtesy call.  Conan.  You know, I know, last week.  You're on the couch there.  Courtesy call.  Courtesy call here for seats that she might need.  Yeah.  So I left that message right after the show yesterday.  Yeah.  And, you know, I went home.  I did some stuff.  Mm-hmm.  Relaxed.  Slept a little bit and woke up.  And, um, I had to go down to the cellar at, like, 9-something. 
[00:13:30]  So I figured, like, by 7 p.m., when the assistant had to call me back, I'm like, well, it's got to just be a big mistake.  Oh.  Oh, no.  It must be a big mistake.  So I called the assistant again.  You did not.  Oh, Dan Desperate.  Yeah.  Hi.  Uh.  Oh.  I think you know it's a bad message when you start the message clearing your throat.  Oh.  Um.  Uh.  Hello.  Um.  Hey.  Yeah, it's Jim again.  I didn't hear back from you yet. 
[00:14:00]  I wasn't sure.  Oh, no.  I wasn't sure if you and Cates and friends were right.  Cates.  Ha.  Seats.  Friends.  Friends.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  Ed Norton.  Ed.  And meanwhile, it was such a nightmare because the show was sold out.  So I called Esty and I'm like, um, and she's like, we have no seats because you know how  the small the seller is.  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm like, but she might come down.  But it's Pete.  But it's Pete.  But it's Pete.  You got to throw someone out. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, well, this is before the show.  So they were going to put her on those three little comedian seats, which are like floaters.  They stink.  I got those seats one night.  I know.  It's just a bench.  Yeah.  It's, and you can't, and bench, no table, just so you, you know.  It's for comics.  Yeah.  Comics, if you're comics, bring your girlfriend or your friend, they got like one of those  three, they added those seats actually just for the comedians to have a place to put  a friend.  When you walk in sometimes, you got nowhere to sit.  Oh.  So, but I'm like, she's a movie star.  Yeah.  I put her on floaters.  Yeah.  You put, she, she gets a table. 
[00:15:00]  Esty doesn't care though.  She just, Esty just doesn't care.  She runs a tight ship down there.  She really doesn't.  She's like, help me out over here.  So, she's like, hey, look, you know, that's what we have.  So, I'm like, all right, whatever.  And I made sure that they were all clear when I got down there.  Because even though I hadn't talked to the assistant, I'm like, maybe they're just going  to show up.  They're just going to show up and surprise me.  Let me, let me, let me tell you something though.  You, you were, you had to be okay with those seats because the thought of her coming down  and you sticking her on a bench is, is making me. 
[00:15:30]  I, I agree.  Um, it turned out there was a couple of seats left.  Um, but I was like, you can't put Kate on a floater.  On a bench?  On a floater?  No.  They're used to being treated like what they are.  Celebrities.  You're supposed to, like when you go down there, they usually, you're watching one comedian  on there.  Like you're going down watching your friend or your boyfriend or whatever it is for 10  or 15 minutes and then you leave.  Right.  Those seats are constantly getting, you know, that's why they have them there.  Not for movie stars. 
[00:16:00]  No.  But anyway, I figured, well, the chair available, there was some bad, there was, there was a  couple of tables available because people don't always show up on the reservations.  You know how it is.  So I poked my head and I'm like, did anybody stop by for me?  And he's like, yes.  Tim said, yes.  The guy up front, uh, and they're upstairs.  So I went upstairs and I was happy to see, um, my friend, uh, Chris and, uh, my other friend  John from PC Richards, the guy who drinks maybe a little too much and likes boxing.  And, uh, the two other buddies whose names I can't remember because I kind of just blocked 
[00:16:30]  it out like it was a childhood.  I saw those four drunkards sitting there.  My friends.  Oh, and you're, and you were probably all excited.  Like they're upstairs.  Oh, I'll stay here.  I go.  I was now.  I gotta, I gotta stay in control.  It's Kate.  I'm going to go upstairs and to, oh, great.  It's drunks.  Hi, Chris and John and friends.  Oh, people I didn't want to see. 
[00:17:00]  Well, they're, they're guys that you're happy to see it under any circumstance except when  you think of British movie stars.  Right.  A starlet.  What a downer.  It was.  So then I'm like, well, maybe they just, they know what time my spot is.  And they're maybe running a little late.  You still held out hope?  So, yeah, I even, I even did my spot, had a very good one, and then stayed until my spot  would have been. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Just in case they gave them the old schedule for the night.  Oh, no.  You hung around.  Yeah.  Just in case.  So, I guess.  When did you realize, Jimmy, that you were stood up by a beautiful movie star?  About like one in the morning.  Oh, my God.  And then you, you left the cellar.  I left a little earlier than that, but. 
[00:18:00]  How did it feel?  I think I'm checking my cell phone.  When, how did it feel walking out of the place?  Like Jim Norton.  It felt like Jim Norton.  No, it did.  It felt like Jimmy Norton.  Like Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Now, I know you.  What did you do after that?  You had to treat yourself to some kind of abuse.  I actually.  I know you had to punish yourself, so let's hear it, man. 
[00:18:30]  Well, I wound up going.  Ben had recommended a little sushi place in, because I was in self-destruct mode.  Big time.  So, Ben had recommended.  Were you cursing everybody?  No, I wasn't mad.  Like.  Did you leave, though, going, I know it.  I just knew it.  It would be almost like if for some reason I had allowed myself to be convinced that I might actually have blonde hair.  And then when I walk by a mirror, I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  Just like you knew it was.  You knew it, you idiot. 
[00:19:00]  Why would you think it's blonde?  So, I went to this place in the village that Ben had recommended by myself.  It had some good sushi, actually.  Oh, I thought it was auto-erotic asphyxiation or something.  No, no.  And there was a little massage place across the street.  Oh.  So, I'm like, there, you can just be you.  Just be you.  There, they don't care who you are.  They don't care.  Jimmy Norton, Jim Norton.  It just doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  You're Joe.  You're all celebrities to them.  You're all celebrities to them. 
[00:19:30]  So, I walk in.  Where every visit has a happy ending.  It certainly did.  Yes.  Well, not for me.  I walk in and the woman yells, we closed.  Oh, you poor bastard.  We closed.  Of course you are.  As you should be.  Why wouldn't you be?  Why would you be open?  Yeah, really.  Why?  So, I kind of walk out there and drink it.  And just slink back.  Oh, the only highlight of my night, which was really kind of just bogged down in almost manic depression, 
[00:20:00]  was that my buddy John got me a raging bull poster signed by LaMotta.  Oh.  Because he's a big boxing guy.  Very nice.  Boxing Hall of Fame.  So, that definitely makes up for fantasies of sex with a British starlet.  It doesn't.  It really doesn't.  If Jake and De Niro had been sitting on the poster, it wouldn't have made up for me.  But it was when you're swimming in the ocean and you're like trying to drown yourself.  Maybe it wasn't a life raft, but it was a little dental floss that got thrown into the water. 
[00:20:30]  Something.  A sign of life out there.  Somebody cares.  Yeah.  So, I went and got my poster.  And went home alone.  Yeah.  With your head down.  Walking back into your building.  Two dopey messages left on her assistant's machine.  That's great.  Well, she was on, I think, Conan last night.  She was?  Okay.  So much to talk about.  First of all, we mentioned the World Cup earlier.  And it's not a big deal in this country, but a huge deal in your country, in the UK.  It's all we've got.  Yeah.  And that's it. 
[00:21:00]  It's all you've got.  Yeah.  It really is.  We went here and watched it in a pub.  Mm-hmm.  And I was expecting it to be, and there was like five people.  Right.  Like me, my daughter, my husband.  Anne Hathaway was there for some reason.  Right.  That's my new wife.  She was watching World Cup with her husband.  Her daughter and her husband.  You'd have to be like a stepfather, Jimmy.  They were busy.  Yeah.  They were a little busy.  That's all.  That's all right.  She'll be back, though.  And I'm sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure you'll have another.  Probably just.  Yeah.  I'm sure you'll have another.  Scheduling conflict.  Scheduling.  She's a big star. 
[00:21:30]  I'm sure she'll remember you the next time she comes through to New York, right?  Yeah.  Then again, who'd she do Conan with?  Pipe Patrice?  Or Billy Burr?  Oh.  Told him.  Told him.  Yeah.  I want us to come down and see you.  Where are you playing?  Oh, here.  Here's my number.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  You know what, Jimmy?  I bet you should show up at Zaney's in Nashville the end of July.  Good point, Cade.  Good point.  That's what I think.  She'll be in Nashville. 
[00:22:00]  That's what I think.  If you think about it, really.  Yes.  I booked a game in Nashville at the end of July, and maybe Cade will show up.  Very nice.  The last time that ever, anything like that ever happened.  And I remember the feeling.  I was in the parking lot of this bar years ago.  I had to be about 17 years old in the parking lot of a bar.  And some chick from high school pulls up.  This girl named Crystal, who I just was like, it completely infatuated with. 
[00:22:30]  And, you know, she couldn't, you know, wouldn't bother giving me the time of day.  And I was like, oh, hi, Crystal.  You want to come in, you know, buy you a drink or something?  She's like, oh, you know something?  I just got to run and pick up one of my friends.  She goes, I'll be right back.  And, yeah, we'll go in and have a drink.  I was like, oh, oh.  I went in that bar and sat there for probably what amounted to eight hours waiting for this girl to come back. 
[00:23:00]  I think she's going to be here any minute, right?  Any minute.  The whole time.  Like every set of headlights that pulled up.  I'm looking.  Look.  And this has got to be her.  This is.  Oh, it's not.  Another beer, please.  And I'm just sitting there waiting and waiting until you finally have to go.  Part of that part of you has to tell the idiot part of you, hey, jackass, get out of here.  She ain't coming back.  But you don't even accept that because I bet even while you were leaving the bar and walking to your car, you kept the front door in sight going, well, maybe. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right up to the last second.  Well, I mean, just in case.  Right to the last second.  Even though you're trying to convince yourself it's just done, it's not going to happen, you're still right to the last second until the bar is out of view, you're still convinced that maybe, maybe she's going to show up.  That is exactly it.  And then I left.  I felt like that scene out of Boogie Nights.  If I had the sound effect, I'd play it. 
[00:24:00]  But I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Stupid.  I'm an idiot.  All right.  We got to move on.  We got to take a break.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  My condolence is there.  Better luck next time because I'm sure there will be a next time for you.  Yeah, no, I'm going to keep my chin up.  I'm going to look forward.  Got to get one first.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm going to keep that general area up where my implant will be installed.  All right.  I've never gotten so much hate mail as I did from all these people who are jealous of my relationship. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, well, you'll get them now.  You'll get even more.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Once again, thank you, Boston, for the early ratings.  It was a great, great day yesterday.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We got Jonathan Davis from Korn calling in today.  We're going to do a little something, something with Korn.  We got tickets to give away to Korn.  Are we going to give the tickets away on the street today?  Yes.  We got what, 20 pairs. 
[00:25:00]  Huh?  100.  We got 100 pairs today?  Wow.  All right, listen.  Around 845, 850 this morning, we're going to be done with the first half of the Opie and  Anthony show, and then we do the second half on XM.  We do a walkover to XM that we broadcast live only on XM.  So in the lobby today and for the walkover, we're going to give away about 100 pairs of  tickets to see Korn.  Where's Korn playing?  Which date?  Jones Beach.  Jones Beach?  September 2nd.  Jones Beach, September 2nd. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  So we got that to do today as well and other things.  I forgot.  Oh, we got tickets to our Opie and Anthony traveling virus comedy show, too.  Yes.  I think we're going to use the old text message thing today.  What is that?  What's that, Opie?  No, I'll explain.  We're going to give a little thing out, and then if you're like the 90-second caller to  the text thing, you'll score some tickets so we can keep our phone lines free because  we're like a talk show.  Yeah.  The phone number, once again, is 1-866-313-FREE.  We'll find out what that is next. 
[00:26:00]  It's the Opie virus spreading across America.  Opie Anthony dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedy gone too far.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O and A, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern, visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Lots of great stuff in the news today.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We had a great week, man.  I got to tell you.  Thanks for checking us out.  Thanks for telling your friends about us.  We greatly, greatly appreciate it.  Matter of fact, a little thank you.  We're here in New York, so we're going to do something for New York today.  Yep.  We got lots and lots of tickets to see corn. 
[00:27:00]  September 2nd at Jones Beach, I believe.  Jonathan Davis is calling the show about 8.30.  We have 100 pairs of tickets to see corn that we're going to give away today  when we finish the first half of the Opie and Anthony show right outside this building.  100 pairs?  I believe 100 pairs of tickets.  Ow.  So if you love corn, I mean, if you show up, you're pretty much guaranteed a pair of tickets.  Yeah.  I can't imagine that how 100 people would show up today.  I know.  Last minute like this.  So we're on 57th Street between 6th and 5th Avenue. 
[00:27:30]  You'll see the crowd, I guess.  Okay?  Yeah.  Or you'll see Big Kenny, Big Club Soda Kenny, all six, seven of them.  Don't rush him.  So we're going to do that right after the show, the first half of the show,  before we continue on XM, around 8.50 to 9 o'clock.  Okay?  That's what we do for New York.  Thank you, New York, for the great ratings you gave us earlier this week.  Thank you, Philly.  Thank you, Boston.  It's very early in the game, but so far, so good. 
[00:28:00]  We got bosses calling us at our homes.  I know.  Saying they love us.  They want to take us out to dinner.  Ugh.  I'm looking for a place, finally.  I'm looking to buy in Manhattan.  Mm-hmm.  Buy my place.  Buy my place.  Slow down.  When's our dinner, by the way, with Joel?  Yeah.  It is so funny, man.  We got a dinner with Joel Hollander, who's pretty much in charge here at CBS.  And then Eric Logan, who's pretty much in charge at XM,  also wants to take us to something next week. 
[00:28:30]  We've said it before.  This is like the divorced parents.  We have two parents.  They're divorced.  And one is trying to outdo the other one to garner our favor.  So what they're doing is this dinner thing, which is nice.  You know, I'd like to go out to dinner with Joel.  I'm sure it'll be a very nice place and stuff.  But then Elo called last night with something that was just phenomenal.  It wins hands down. 
[00:29:00]  It really does win hands down.  And now Joel's going to have to step up.  Yep.  Because can we say what it is?  Yeah.  I think we can.  Yeah.  Sure.  They got a table at Derek Jeter's charity event, the Turn 2 charity event  that he's been doing for 10 years now, ever since he was a rookie.  And all the Yankees show up to it.  It's a big, like, fancy-schmancy dinner event.  And we are cordially invited.  We're going to be sitting at one of the tables having dinner there, a bunch of Yankees around. 
[00:29:30]  Just a great evening.  I actually have to go buy stuff.  What do you mean?  I've got to buy something to wear.  Cool.  Yeah, I just got to wear a suit.  You are a frigging 10-year-old.  No, I did buy a suit when I was anorexic, and it doesn't fit me anymore.  I tried it on.  I had to go to a wedding in Philly.  Purging.  I had to go to a wedding in Philly, and I brought this suit down that I bought while we were, you know, on.  You're one suit guy. 
[00:30:00]  You're one suit guy.  You know something?  Ass, you've been hanging with me for 12 years.  How many times have we ever had to wear a suit?  I know, but we're...  I don't even wear a suit once a year.  Yeah, but...  I wear a suit for weddings and funerals.  Tomorrow should be suit day on the O.P. Anthony show.  But we're kind of professionals now.  You know, you should be more than just one suit.  You're an adult, for God's sake.  I'm one suit guy with pants that aren't even close to fitting anymore. 
[00:30:30]  That I bought, I think, when my brother Quinn was getting married.  So I bring this suit down to Philly.  Jesus.  And I'm in this basement getting ready for the wedding, and Lindsey comes down and goes,  What's going on, man?  Why are you still down here dressing?  I'm like, We got a major problem.  And I just, like, turn around, and my gut is, like, falling over the front of this suit.  And I'm not even that fat.  It was just that I bought this suit when I was really thin, when I just didn't feel like eating for about two years. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  She's like, Oh, my God.  So I ended up, like, getting some weird safety pin thing, apparatus to kind of keep the, you know, the pants open, but they wouldn't fall down.  And then I was wearing my shirt kind of, like, you know, bunched out in front to cover it up.  And then the suit jacket.  I didn't know what to do because it was last minute.  I couldn't run to a store at that point.  I was screwed.  You know, that is great when you're maybe in your late teens, early 20s, when your first friends start getting married. 
[00:31:30]  And you go to their wedding and realize, I need a suit.  And you have one.  And it's like you got to use string to tie it.  This was a really nice suit.  I went all out.  It was fitted and everything.  But, unfortunately, I got it fitted when I was a lot thinner because, like I explained, I didn't feel like eating for a while there.  Big boy clothes.  All right.  I'll get something.  Buy some big boy clothes.  I'll get something for the Dirt Jeter event.  Don't worry.  By the way, three mice in a day and a half. 
[00:32:00]  There you go.  So far, what, this week?  All of a sudden, I was, like, I was doing well with the mice in my apartment.  And, I don't know, the warm weather is getting the cockroaches back.  I've seen two or three cockroaches.  And I've killed three mice with those electric mice traps, mouse traps, whatever.  Why are you there?  I looked at a place again last night, and I'm thinking I'm starting to like this place.  So, keep your fingers crossed.  Here's what you do.  You check into a hotel.  And just bail?  You abandon that place.  You kick in the walls. 
[00:32:30]  You kick holes in the walls.  And whatever else you can do.  Take eggs.  Look, man, I told you.  And throw them and break them, like, under the radiators and things like that.  Oh, yeah, this is all great stuff you do when you've been screwed over by a landlord.  What?  You kick holes in the walls.  And you take eggs.  And you break them in the walls under the radiators.  Because then it stinks.  And they don't know where it's coming from.  You hide cracked eggs in places in the house.  And they'll never get the stink out.  Well, too many of you don't have a video camera, man. 
[00:33:00]  You should videotape the bugs and all the mice you find.  Maybe you should videotape that stuff.  Like I said, and this is no joke, well over 20 mice that I've killed with these electric  trash.  Make them.  Faithful listener brought it in.  I wasn't killing any mice for well over a month.  I thought the problem was finally solved.  But I told you how the downstairs wall exploded from all that rain we had.  Yeah.  So, that's not fixed yet.  So, there's a huge hole.  I mean, it is huge.  I got to take pictures, actually, and throw it on the website.  You have a hole that leads to some what? 
[00:33:30]  Well, I told you.  It's in my bedroom downstairs.  And at night, we hear crap every once in a while between the ceiling and the floor upstairs.  Animals.  So, now the hole is there.  So, obviously, they're coming out now because they have a way to get into the apartment.  Because I've killed three mice in the last day and a half.  And I changed my bait.  I'm very happy that I changed my bait.  What are you using?  Yeah, they got to get this show in some redneck areas. 
[00:34:00]  What are you using?  They can appreciate this talk.  Well, I was going with the peanut butter.  And the peanut butter did...  I don't have a lasagna belly, Lou.  Lasagna belly.  You asked.  I don't have a lasagna belly.  What a nice guy.  Anyway, the peanut butter was doing the job for quite some time now, right?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  And I splurged when I was having guests.  No, you didn't.  A couple weeks ago.  And I got some nice cheese so we could have some nice cheese and wine.  Ooh.  And some of that really nice smelling cheese.  You know, the worse the smell, the better the cheese, basically.  So they say.  There was a little of that left over.  So I popped those into the mousetraps and they've been sitting in the mousetraps for like two weeks just heating up because of the warm weather because my AC is not working quite well.  Of course it's not.  So the kitchen actually kind of reeks right now. 
[00:35:00]  Reeks of feet.  Reeks.  Like cheese.  Because it's mixed up.  I decided to mix the peanut butter and pretty much the rotting cheese at this point into the electric mousetraps.  And now I'm back killing those suckers.  You got three?  Three in a day and a half.  Not even in a day and a half.  Maybe, well, yeah, yesterday morning, yesterday afternoon, and this morning.  That's legitimately, you're infested.  Yeah, you're infested.  You have an infested apartment.  I know.  It's New York.  What can I tell you?  Did the stone bag landlord get back in touch with you? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, finally.  But I don't know.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Did you, I love your mousetrap though.  The mousetrap Opaz is electric.  Right.  It's not just a snap mousetrap.  They go into this little black box, go into a little like kind of twisty maze thing for a second.  And then there's two metal plates and the bait is just beyond the two metal plates.  So the mouse has to actually stand on the two metal plates. 
[00:36:00]  One positive, one negative.  Bam!  Electrocution.  An instant death.  Not even two seconds.  Like, not, I heard the trap go off once and I ran right in there.  I mean, so dead it's not even funny.  Right away.  Right away.  Everyone's asking for the name of the mousetrap because I'm not the only one that's having this problem.  I don't know the name.  Maybe I'll find out before the end of the show.  So, there you go.  What am I going to do?  You got to get out of there.  I'm trying.  Trust me, I'm trying. 
[00:36:30]  Too long.  I'm trying.  Buy big boy clothes.  Get out of your apartment.  That's what you got.  You're living like a college kid.  You're living like a college kid.  An apartment with mice and cockroaches and a suit that doesn't fit you.  Do you have those big electric spools and milk crates to put your books in?  Honestly, my apartment isn't that bad.  I should be living better, but that's the beauty of me. 
[00:37:00]  I don't care.  You don't care.  I take care of everyone else in my family except for myself.  You know what's going to happen, though?  You know, years are going to go by and you're going to say, why didn't I take a little bit  of care of myself and just kind of, you know, enjoy myself a little more?  Yeah.  Splurge a little.  I might be putting in a bid for a place today.  How's that sound?  Oh, okay.  All right.  There's a step in the right direction.  How's that sound?  Is it off the ground floor?  Way up. 
[00:37:30]  Good.  Way up.  Way up.  High above the Negroes.  In this city, my friend.  For my luck, the freaking...  That's right.  These towering behemoths.  You'll be living in the clouds with other white people.  Smoking your Lucky Strike cigarettes.  We've just won the war against the Nazis.  And now it's time to win the war against the immigrants. 
[00:38:00]  You'll be greeted in the hallways by wonderful Caucasian people.  High above the filth-ridden city, full of mice and cockroaches.  That's right.  Dance with your best gal in a pure white environment.  That's where Opie's moving.  I'll be infested by...  High in the clouds, which are also pure white.  I'll be infested by those eagles that they have every once in a while. 
[00:38:30]  Eagles, the symbol of America.  That'll be mine.  White America.  That'll be my luck.  They'll decide to nest in my new abode if I get it.  So there's an update on my fine living.  And then I had to walk over another homeless guy.  And I live in...  You guys know I live in a nice neighborhood.  Yeah.  I do live in a nice neighborhood.  And my place isn't that bad.  It's just the problem is it's on a ground floor and they did construction next door and they just shook up all the action, man. 
[00:39:00]  So the action is moving around and that's the mice and the freaking cockroaches.  Can I enlighten you about yourself a little bit?  Yeah.  I don't know if you've noticed.  What?  But I'm going to enlighten you about yourself.  What?  What?  You live in a nice area.  Mm-hmm.  Ever since I've met you, you've lived in a nice area.  Yeah.  I wish...  You've lived in a crap hole in a nice area.  You lived in Northport, Long Island.  Yeah.  Great area.  Very wealthy area. 
[00:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  You found the crappiest place in Northport to live in.  You then moved to Massachusetts.  Wellesley.  Wellesley, Massachusetts.  You lived in Wellesley.  Wellesley.  Wellesley is a well-to-do, very wealthy area of Massachusetts.  You know how embarrassing it was when people would come visit me, you know, from New York or whatever, or old friends from like Rochester or what have you?  Yeah.  And I would drive them, you know, through Wellesley and they're like, oh, look at you.  And you're just passing mansion. 
[00:40:00]  They're going by like mansion, mansion, mansion, mansion.  And wham, both sides of the car, mansions are flying by.  And I'm like, well, here we are.  Pulling to Opie's shed.  Here we are.  It was the shed.  Don't worry about the crazy guy that lives upstairs.  Yeah.  And he babbles to himself at night, but don't worry about him.  Yeah, you didn't even have the whole house, right?  No.  Oh, my God.  But it was Wellesley.  Mm-hmm.  And then you decide to get an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which is the place in Manhattan. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Upper West Side is known worldwide as being the wealthy area.  Don't forget my...  And you get cockroach, mice hole-in-wall place.  Don't forget my joint in Huntington.  Right.  Huntington.  One of the nicest areas on Long Island.  Again.  And I was, you know, sharing a house there, too.  Where one day the police arrived to try to dig up bones of a body they thought was under the porch.  Oh, God.  That was a scary day.  That was a scary day. 
[00:41:00]  I don't care if the neighborhood's nice.  If the police are looking for body parts under your house, perhaps you're in a bad area.  That was a scary day.  I forgot all about that.  My landlord, John, at the time, was redoing the porch, and he had to dig it up.  John Gacy?  Yeah.  What was his name?  He was digging up...  He took the old porch out, and he was digging some holes for the new post or whatever.  And all of a sudden, I came upon bones that, I swear to you, look like a child's bones. 
[00:41:30]  A little baby bones?  A child's bones.  And he just stopped digging.  And he used to be, you know, NYPD.  And he works in Brooklyn at a firehouse.  And he just called.  And all hell broke loose.  They roped off the area.  To get the hell out of here tape went up.  Dude, they got...  Yeah.  I wasn't allowed in the place for, like, a day.  They had the CSI people there.  I forgot all about this.  Really?  Did you get autographed? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, the real...  Oh, okay.  I thought the show showed up, and I thought that was odd.  Then the cops, they're all big, you know, fans of this radio show.  They always have been.  Yeah.  And they're looking like, you're...  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, picture me, you, dead baby?  But you...  Yeah, I do live here.  Well, you better not go anywhere.  Yeah, I know.  And I guess it turned out...  You better not go anywhere.  Wait a minute.  Were you a suspect in child murder?  Dude, when they find, you know, bones that look like it could be a child's bones, they  don't want anyone going anywhere.  They don't give a crap who you are. 
[00:42:30]  Everyone's got to stick around.  You stay close.  No problem.  Perhaps an heir to the Hughes fortune that you were a little jealous of.  We could, you know, we want to make sure we could get a hold of you.  And it turned out it was...  I don't even remember anymore.  Was it a dog?  Yeah, it turned out to be a dog or something.  Was it a dog?  Yeah.  Do you remember?  I think it was a dog.  But I saw the bones, too, and I'm like, oh my, yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's an ugly kid with a huge snout.  But I guess the people...  Large canines. 
[00:43:00]  This house was...  We loved them.  This house is really old.  It's on a street that the houses are just 150 years old, something like that.  Yeah, it's like the first settled little town in Huntington.  So some ass decided when their dog died to bury it under the porch, I guess.  Or maybe the porch wasn't there at the time.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But right in the front yard?  Yeah, that was creepy, too.  So...  Yeah, I'm trying, man.  Yeah.  You got to splurge a little bit.  I'm trying.  Nice.  All right.  We were going to talk about...  Before we do, can I ask, where can you get good food in the city at this hour?  I want to throw something at somebody's face right now. 
[00:43:30]  I can't tell you how irritating it is to not get food.  Don't pick me.  Don't pick me.  Dude, well, there's two people you know I won't pick.  One at that mic and one at that mic.  Meal and Ticket.  Yeah, we should change the name of the show to Meal and Ticket.  Meal and Ticket.  Meal and Ticket show.  Well, BCN, I think, was supposed to send food today because we gave them some fine  ratings, some fine early ratings.  Does that happen Monday?  What?  Monday now?  Monday?  Wow. 
[00:44:00]  Dude, you got to do what I do.  You got to bring in your own food.  Boy, YSP was able to pull it together right the next day, right?  I think YSP's still the better syndicated radio station.  I don't want to start pitting the stations against each other, but YSP did come across  immediately with some gruff.  Yeah, we don't want to do what we're doing with the bosses and pitting them against each  other, but let's be honest.  We are getting a great Yankee dinner out of it.  YSP gave us a great, great buffet.  Yeah.  A great buffet.  I love YSP.  However, Chachi wants to go above and beyond for us. 
[00:44:30]  Oh.  It's going to take a little longer.  No, no, no.  I mean, he's going really high end, so it's going to be on Monday.  Gold tureens of soup.  That's what I want.  I demand a gold tureen.  No, actually, you will be impressed, Jim.  Maybe you can go to the filthy Al-Qaeda hideout that apparently sells our food every day and  get me some more watery eggs.  I hate watery eggs.  Dirt bags.  Wait a minute.  If Jimmy's going to be impressed, that means egg whites for me, seltzer for Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  And a toasted bagel.  And a dried bagel for Anthony, and some kind of Aussie paraphernalia for freaking...  No, no, no.  All I need is...  I want an oatmeal.  Yeah, that's all Jimmy wanted.  And Sam hands me...  Aye.  He hands me a thing of cement.  This is what they gave me.  There's no liquid in it.  It looked like sidewalk cement.  What happened, Sam?  What happened?  And this.  Look at these bananas. 
[00:45:30]  They look like child fingers.  I have two yellow child fingers.  They do look like child fingers.  Worse than child fingers.  Grab...  If you had five of them, it would be like shaking hands with Hervé Villachez.  They're little fidget fingers.  Rot little...  One is perfect for holding the handle, and one is perfect for pulling the trigger.  Pulling the trigger.  Give me two more.  Ouch.  Ouch.  It hurts.  I want to hear the last recording of his ugly voice.  As he just passed into the other world. 
[00:46:00]  The netherworld.  Sam, make it fast.  We got...  What happened, Sam?  It's hard to find good food in the city.  I told you the Brooklyn Diner was closed.  Why is the Brooklyn Diner open at eight?  Because they don't...  Does nobody else eat breakfast before eight o'clock in the morning?  They do great business.  They don't need to be open any earlier.  That's when the wonderful people come to the city.  That's where Seinfeld eats every morning.  Yeah.  If you got a place where Seinfeld eats every morning, you don't need to open any earlier  than eight.  Hey, Jerry, get up earlier.  His tip alone is probably taking care of the entire staff over there.  Oh, yeah.  You got to do what I do. 
[00:46:30]  I just...  I gave up a...  I don't know.  Well over a year ago, I bring my own food in every morning.  Because I know what I like, and that's it.  Where does Bill go?  I get my blueberries and my Honey Nut Cheerios and my yogurt and my banana.  You know what?  You know, Sam, he just dissed you.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you did.  Bill didn't tell him where to go.  He said, Bill...  Where's Bill?  Bill knows where to go.  No, no.  I said, where does Bill go?  Not where's Bill.  Where's Bill go for fruit?  You know, this fruit...  The orange is great.  Which implies that there is a place out there.  No, the orange is not great.  Even if this is out. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, no.  My Robert Reed orange.  Ow!  Oh, God.  What was wrong with the orange?  You got...  You got...  He rocked with...  He hit he rocked with your orange.  How did that happen?  He's way over there.  You ever see orange come apart like that?  That's how the orange laughs at you.  I just want food that is healthy.  Let's do the whole orchard.  All right.  Let's...  Let's say hi to John in Philly. 
[00:47:30]  John.  Hey, what's up, brothers?  How are you guys doing this morning?  We're doing all right, John.  I'm in a foul mood.  Just to get back to who you're talking about, Ovi's living conditions.  And when you guys moved up to Massachusetts and you guys had to stay with your mother-in-law...  Yeah.  Anthony and his ex-wife, they leave the mother-in-law.  They go out and they get their own place.  Within weeks.  Yeah, two weeks.  Ovi continued to live with Anthony's mother-in-law.  For six months at least.  At least six months.  It could have been eight.  I'm not sure.  I don't remember anymore.  I think it was about, yeah, six to eight months.  Yeah, Ovi lived with my mother-in-law. 
[00:48:00]  My ex-mother-in-law.  Ah, banana.  She's now passed on.  I'm kind of like a free spirit.  I think I would have made a great hippie if I was born earlier than I was.  You just can crash anywhere.  I would have made a pretty good hippie.  Yeah.  I don't need much.  I do need a nice new place, though.  I'm acknowledging that finally.  Now that she's passed on, you will admit to killing Chester, right?  No, I will not.  Now that she's buried with Chester somewhere. 
[00:48:30]  And didn't you accidentally dump over Chester's ashes?  Well, no, the phone cord.  She, yeah.  The 80-foot phone cord that she had in the house so she could, like, take the phone anywhere.  Judy, God rest her soul, loved her dog, Chester.  And one time Chester did something bad, and Ovi kind of chastised Chester with his boot.  And Chester died shortly after that with liver cancer.  Dude, I don't want the animal rights activists coming out. 
[00:49:00]  They're not going to because it was liver cancer.  You can't give a dog liver cancer by giving a little nudge.  There's a lot more to the story.  But she cremated the dog, and then its ashes sat there up on a shelf for years until she passed on.  And then I guess they did whatever they did.  I don't know.  Well, they want to be buried together, I remember.  But at one point, Opie, she had a cord on her phone that was, like, a mile long, and Opie's on the phone.  Wait, no joke.  This cord was at least 80 feet. 
[00:49:30]  You could go anywhere in the house.  And it always got tangled and, like...  Yeah, so it would end up with this huge knot at one in the middle of it, swinging back and forth.  And it hit the urn and knocked its ashes on the floor.  Opie had to scrape them up or something.  Oh, what a scene.  How you stayed there that long.  The best was when I took out all her knickknacks by accident.  Little Hummels just got wiped out with the phone cord.  And she's like, that's okay.  I've only had these for, like, 40 years. 
[00:50:00]  40 years.  40 years.  I'll just get some crazy glue.  It was a true antique.  And put it together.  I could do no wrong in her eyes.  No, no.  When Anthony got divorced from her lovely daughter.  Yeah.  Like, you were cut out of all the Opie and Anthony pictures.  Yeah, she had a big poster.  But she kept me up on her wall.  Of our Demented World CD.  The posters looked just like the cover. 
[00:50:30]  Me and Opie.  So she had taken it and cut it in half and kept the picture of Opie on her wall.  My picture, long gone.  All right, we got a break.  Really fast.  We're thanking New York today, big time.  Thank you.  Jonathan Davis is calling from Korn.  The family values thing has happened in, what, September 2nd at Jones Beach?  Huh?  Jones Beach.  And, you know, New York gave us some fine early ratings.  So today, right outside the station, when we're done with the first half of the Opie and Anthony show, 
[00:51:00]  we're going to give away 100 pairs of tickets to see Korn September 2nd at Jones Beach.  All you have to do is show up.  Hold on, around 8.50 to 9 o'clock outside this fine building in the lobby.  We're on 57th between 6th and 5th Avenue, okay?  All right, Kato Kaelin.  That's what people are calling you.  Yeah, I know.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****.  ****. 
[00:52:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, we're slowing it down a little bit.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  A little later this hour, we got tickets for the Opie and Anthony traveling virus comedy show. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Featuring all the comedians that you know and love from this fine program.  Rock on, yeah.  Brought to you by Bud Lights.  The lineups are on ticketmaster.com.  Tickets available now.  I want to rock.  Well, it's a busy news day.  Heroin needle in your arm.  I love these guys, but yeah.  It's a little too slow for my taste.  It's early in the morning. 
[00:53:00]  Anthony, lots going on.  Yes.  Clemens came back yesterday to baseball.  Yes, he did.  He didn't get the win.  He didn't get the loss.  He pitched five and a third, I think, right?  Yeah.  Had a few strikeouts.  Threw 100 pitches.  Had about 51 strikes out of those 100 pitches.  100 pitches.  Did well.  And how much did he make?  I think he made about a million dollars.  About a million bucks?  I don't know.  But he did aight.  He did aight.  Yeah.  So he's back pitching. 
[00:53:30]  We don't need to play the audio of that, do we?  Nah.  U.S. is out of the World Cup.  Who saw that coming?  Who saw that?  Everybody.  Let's just say, who saw that?  Who saw that?  Nobody.  Nobody.  That was a cute little distraction, so let's get back to the real sports of America.  Thank God, because they really try to hype that up and make something of it.  And sorry, I just wasn't there with it.  No.  Along with a lot of other people. 
[00:54:00]  Do you even know who we lost to yesterday?  I know we did lose to Ghana.  Right.  Ghana.  Do you even know where Ghana is?  Right next to Aria.  It's a country.  No.  We're not far from Weah.  It's an African nation.  I believe it's on the west coast of Africa.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, here's a little audio from our loss.  Like...  It wasn't a good call. 
[00:54:30]  To have that call in the 47th minute after our team worked so hard to get back in the game is difficult.  I feel sorry for our team.  But the position to have to chase the game on that call is kind of remarkable in a game at this level.  A couple decisions, especially that one really going in at halftime.  And if we were 1-1, I think we still were confident.  But it was difficult.  They sat back and crowded in space.  We couldn't get...  We hit the post once. 
[00:55:00]  But, yeah, it was tough.  We're disappointed because we felt we had a good chance.  And coming into the game, we really believed we could have won this game.  It was one ugly American effort.  Here's the final tally.  Three games played.  Over 270 minutes of soccer in Germany.  And Team USA scored just one goal on their own merits in the World Cup.  They mustered just four shots on goal for supposing keepers to make exactly one save.  Yeah, and the only reason we even made it to that game with Ghana was because... 
[00:55:30]  Who was it?  The guy from Italy scored on his own goal?  Yeah.  It wasn't even...  It was nothing, nothing, or...  That's why I can't be bothered with soccer.  Did you hear that?  We had four shots on goal.  How many games did we play?  Three or four?  Maybe three, right?  Three, yeah.  Three games, four shots on goal?  Yeah, there's action.  That's a lot of action.  Kicking a ball on a gigantic football field, it just stinks.  The field is giant.  There's no reason for that. 
[00:56:00]  By the way, Ghana got a penalty kick at the end of the first half.  That's what he was talking about.  It was a bad call, I guess.  Football.  I guess it was a bad call.  What's that, Jim?  Football.  Obvious idiots.  We put foot on ball, football.  Football.  That's not football, my friend.  We are footballers.  Heroes in our country.  Yeah, really?  Are they?  Well, there are nobodies here. 
[00:56:30]  Mike on Long Island writes,  Guys, sorry, this is off subject, but on way out, whatever that means,  you are mentioned in the World Almanac Book of Records, page 115,  as part of the largest settlement with the FCC for fines against Infinity Broadcasting.  We're on a list.  Very nice.  I've seen that before.  All right, why don't we get into some more interesting stuff.  World Cup is over, and not many people really cared.  No.  They goofed about how much they didn't care.  Huh? 
[00:57:00]  They kind of goofed about how much they didn't care, unlike the talk shows and stuff.  It's just not our sport.  All the monologues.  Anybody watching this World Cup thing?  It's a, you know, that's about all you got.  They've been trying to shove soccer down our throats for so long, it's just not sticking.  Another four years will go by, and they'll try again.  We don't care about soccer.  You know who cares about soccer is the new Americans.  You mean the newbies?  Illegal immigrants?  Well, them and the newbies, the ones that have only been here, you know, a few years. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Those are the only people that care.  And soccer moms out there that just want their kids to all be equal.  And play.  On every possible level.  Put on your shin pads.  I want my kid to play soccer so he's equal with everybody else.  No, you get out there and play with the boys.  Everyone is just equal out there.  It's all winners.  You don't really know who the star of the team is.  Yeah.  It's that type of sport.  Did Clinton, the one who started that whole soccer mom term, did he?  I think so, yeah, during his campaign it started. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It seems like something that would have popped up during that administration.  Yeah.  Soccer mom.  All about empowerment, is it?  Well, we got a great news story.  Screw the soccer.  We're done with that.  Thank God.  Online funerals, Anthony.  Yes.  Online funerals.  Wow.  Exactly.  I love it.  Here's what the internet is all about, people.  We got a little audio.  Check this out.  It's not an easy topic, but would you believe funerals are going high tech?  And these days, I guess everything does eventually.  A new chapel in West Babylon is offering a virtual funeral for people who can't make it 
[00:58:30]  to the service in person.  CBS 2's Jennifer McLogan has the story.  When a Long Island man died this week, some of his extended family scattered across the  country were unable to fly in for the funeral, which under Jewish custom was held within 24  hours.  But they said they felt a part of it anyway because they were able to watch it live via  an internet hookup.  You like the way it looks?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  There is a time frame where they want to bury someone.  So instead of delaying the service, those that can't get there can at least get a chance  to see the service not having been there physically.  Morbid.  When you leave it on at night by accident and you see the mortician climbing in, enjoying  your loved one.  Committing crimes against humanity.  While they're online.  The only thing that comes off is the pants.  They leave the top on with the stupid hands folded over the chest. 
[00:59:30]  Mortician doesn't care.  It stops him.  This is a bit creepy, huh?  It is very creepy, especially, you know.  You know, if a loved one dies, you got to step up and you just got to get there.  You got to get there.  No matter what, you just got to get there.  Right.  You can't look in on it.  It's not.  That isn't what it's all about.  Looking at.  We have video cameras here and we know what goes on.  What?  I can see somebody just entering the room randomly.  Hey, I want to see the widow's cans. 
[01:00:00]  Can she flash everyone?  Yeah.  Bouncing people out of the room.  Some jacker.  Jacker.  Rolling on casket, laughing my ass off.  Right.  Look at everyone crying.  It's funny because I don't know them.  Bunch of babies.  Grief is not the same.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Send.  But they're not going to have a camera on the corpse, I guess? 
[01:00:30]  No.  Only on the podium where people will speak.  Oh.  And then on the crowd.  Oh, okay.  We got the audio of this.  Yeah.  Two different camera angles.  There's two different camera angles.  There's a front and a rear.  Oh.  A panoramic view is from the back, and then from this camera, a close-up of the speaker.  Are you afraid of being criticized that this is undignified?  No, I don't think so.  It's a choice.  Kevin Gray co-owns the Star of David Memorial Chapel in West Babylon, believed to be the first in the New York area to webcast funeral. 
[01:01:00]  There's no additional charge.  This is part of the service.  And everyone seems to have an opinion on this.  Opinion.  I think it is a little odd.  I don't even like to go to a funeral.  Computers have already become human personnel.  But industry experts predict webcasting will become more popular as funeral directors get younger and Internet connections speed up.  Yeah.  That's fine.  You don't have to spend $1,000 on airfare to fly in just to pay respects because you're kind of new somebody. 
[01:01:30]  Just watch it online.  This way you can flip back to another room.  There's nothing worse than when a relative dies right before you're about to finish.  So at least this way you can enjoy the services and still get back to that other chat room.  Someone on the instant feedback is suggesting that it updated.  Oh, great.  Always does.  Oh, I hate when this happens.  It was a good line, too. 
[01:02:00]  WMAO, weeping my ass off.  Where is it?  Oh, okay.  Bird from Philly.  The best thing would be if somebody could hack that site and put a screaming face in the middle of the service.  You know those when they scare you?  Yeah.  It's like, look at this.  Look closely.  Yeah, look closely at this picture and turn your volume up real loud on your monitor so you could hear the sound of this.  And then, in the middle of this scary face.  Yeah, put that in there. 
[01:02:30]  By the way, this is nice.  Someone from their mobile device, because you could send in instant feedback from your cell phones.  She can.  They are ripping you off.  We have seen you die on Pal Talk.  Hey.  Now, our shows are great.  Yeah, that's a little creepy.  I think casket cam, though.  You know.  Yeah.  You're there.  You go to a funeral to pay your respects to the dead person, right?  All right.  All right.  Could someone get this really hot video that they're playing on the Today Show?  All right. 
[01:03:00]  I'll tell you what that's about.  You know the cat fight video?  Well, it's not.  Probably it's not the cat fight, because there's been this whole thing on the Internet now with fights.  Right.  Fights are huge on the Internet now.  People tape them with their camera phones in high schools, on the streets.  Every fight now is broadcast on the Internet if kids are fighting, on school buses.  Well, because there's cameras everywhere.  And the cat fights are the coolest thing to watch.  You watch two high school girls probably upset over a boy or something. 
[01:03:30]  And after school, you do the old thing.  After school, I'm going to kick your ass.  And now people videotape it, pop it up on the websites.  And before you know it, you just Google.  Google, like, girl street fights.  Ooh.  And you'll get, like, girls fighting each other.  Just punching, pulling hair.  That's what the Internet's about.  Screw the funerals.  Can we get some cat fights for our comedy thing?  Yeah.  For our comedy show?  For the traveling O&A virus thing? 
[01:04:00]  Cat fight videos.  No, right on the stage in front of everyone when we do all those dates.  But you can't do that.  Why?  We did it one other time for the road show.  It's highly illegal.  It's licensed.  Huh?  It's highly illegal.  It's cat fight organizations out there.  We'll just contact.  Yes.  Remember at the road show?  Where was it?  At that hell hole down in Jersey?  Asbury Park.  Asbury Park.  Asbury.  Yeah.  And I saw something on TV recently that it's coming back.  Asbury Park is coming back.  How many times is it coming back?  No, it's not. 
[01:04:30]  Stop it.  Can't yell that, Kev.  Sorry.  What did he say?  He said the BS word.  BS?  BS.  Where do you think we are?  We are on FM radio.  That's right, Potty Mouth.  You have to go on YouTube and enter in Girl Fight.  Girl Fight.  Or Chick Fight.  Best videos ever.  Yeah.  Girls.  And a bunch of guys, like, taunt them.  They stand around, like, in a circle.  You've seen, like, people fight in high school and stuff. 
[01:05:00]  How they do it.  So what's that video, then?  Just showing the...  It might be showing that, yeah, this whole thing of videotaped fights.  Right.  Between...  And guys do it, too.  I mean, they're brutal, you know?  Great fun to watch, though.  By the way, Cigars and Scotch backing up to the funerals being broadcast on the internet.  Next, there will be message boards that trash the wakes.  Yeah.  You know, this wake sucked.  Yeah.  It wasn't.  This wake, you know, the wake used to be good, but this funeral parlor just isn't cutting 
[01:05:30]  it anymore.  You know, guys, I'm paying to see this wake.  You're stepping up.  Yawn.  Boring.  Right.  I don't see a lot of action.  Is the body going to do anything today?  Did they prep for this wake?  All these relatives do is complain.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Damn message boards, man, please. 
[01:06:00]  Well, look at this.  John on Long Island.  John, what's up?  Hey, opening.  Uh, my wife...  Poor Opie and Anthony.  I'm driving.  Uh, my wife, uh, and I live here on night Except what we got, uh, uh, relatives in Vegas.  Relatives in Boston.  We got married.  We used PalTalk so they could watch our wedding.  And when my son was seven days old, we did his rift on the Internet also so they could be there and watch.  So they had to watch that get snipped on the Internet? 
[01:06:30]  Well, they saw the service and as much as they can.  Did they actually get to see the snip?  Yeah.  If the rabbi's head didn't block the camera, probably.  The moil's head blocked the camera?  The moil.  The moil.  Why don't the Jews just get a hold of them?  You know that you're giving Gary Glitter an opportunity right there, right?  Yeah, really.  We tuned in to this bris going on.  Obviously, some of these people were not family members. 
[01:07:00]  The police were outside waiting for them.  Well, this is true.  A lot of times the moils after, and this might be hardcore, I don't know when they do it,  will clean the blood after that with their mouths.  Yes, yes.  We talked about that, right?  It's supposed to be some ancient, ancient ritual.  Started, I'm sure, by a Roman emperor.  Where they do it.  What are you doing?  I'm cleaning it.  Yes.  It's dirty.  It's quite a moil.  Clean.  Of course you do.  Don't you? 
[01:07:30]  I'll be leaving.  It was started by Gary Glitter, Roman numeral eight.  Gary Glitterus.  Gary Glitter V line, line, line.  X.  X.  Nothing.  Poor Gary.  Almost.  Gary's doing some hard time over there.  Yeah.  In Southeast Asia.  Two years or something.  Not really a lot of time, but you know that's got to be some hard time. 
[01:08:00]  And some, where is he?  Thailand?  Yeah.  Cambodia, somewhere.  Vietnam.  I don't care where it is.  Chuck Norris ain't coming to get you.  He's not going to come to bust you out, Gary Glitter.  I've got to get Gary Glitter.  No one gets left behind.  All right.  No one gets left behind.  Yeah.  There's a joke there.  I know.  Guys, we've got to take a break.  I don't want to take a break.  I don't either, but we've got to catch up.  We're having so much fun. 
[01:08:30]  We're way behind.  Stalker under the bed.  This is a great story as well today.  Also, we should get into some serious stuff.  White Sox, Ozzy Guillen.  Yeah.  Sensitive training.  Sensitivity training, yeah.  Sensitivity training because he said fag.  We got that story.  It's a big story today.  Gay people have this problem with the word fag, and they really shouldn't.  And we'll explain that, but I think you know why.  All right.  Also, we have a ton of news teases that we have played on this show, and we want to add 
[01:09:00]  some of these to the News Tease Hall of Fame before we retire all these news teases.  Retire them and raise them up to the rafters.  That's right.  So we got that as well today.  And also, don't forget, we got Jonathan Davis of Korn calling in in about an hour, 830.  The Family Values Tour will be at Jones Beach September 2nd.  And we had some great news earlier this week here in New York City.  Yes.  Early ratings are really, really good, so we got a nice little surprise for everybody  today.  We got 100 pairs of tickets to see Korn September 2nd.  Look at this. 
[01:09:30]  You think we're kidding?  Ben just walked in with the tickets.  Look at how many tickets we got to give away today to see Korn September 2nd at Jones Beach.  Look at this.  Look at this.  They can.  It's radio.  Look at this.  Oh, hold it up to the pal.  Here, Jimmy.  Show them on Pal Talk.  That's only one pile.  Here's the other pile.  Private pile.  So pretty much, if you're in the area and you love Korn, you're going to get a pair of  tickets to see them September 2nd at Jones Beach.  When this show ends, the first half of the Opie and Anthony show, and then we go to XM  to continue, we do the walk live on XM, and we start from the lobby of this building. 
[01:10:00]  Just show up, 57th, between 6th and 5th Avenue, and we're just going to be handing out tickets  to see Korn.  Don't do that.  Don't put the tickets in your back.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'll rub in the back.  You want Korn?  Jimmy.  Look at that.  Look at all those tickets.  Look at that.  Look at that.  A bevy of tickets. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yes, Ben?  I'm hurting the mic with my tickets.  Hey, are all these in order?  They better be.  You'll be handing them out to people.  Are they in order?  Really?  They'll be able to sit next to each other.  Huh?  Is it general admission?  No.  Are they in order?  They have to be.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  I already did it once.  Oh, no.  No, because then you're going to have to, um...  No.  I don't have to do anything.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'll...  Somebody better start putting these back together, because they're really out of order. 
[01:11:00]  They're out of order.  Oh, man.  Tickets are out of order.  Oh, we just did the old 52-card pickup gag with the tickets.  It's called...  Let's see how good our interns really are.  Now they have to...  We like to test them from time to time.  Now clean it up!  Be a ticket broker, just like your father.  Throw yours, too, Jimmy.  Throw yours.  No, I can't do it.  Wow, that's a lot of tickets.  Throw yours, so I don't look like a complete idiot.  No, I can't.  I dropped them.  They fell.  My tickets fell.  Oh, no.  Drop them. 
[01:11:30]  I dropped my tickets.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I dropped my tickets.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  They fell.  And here goes the interns.  Well...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well...  All over the place.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  There's 100 pairs of corn tickets all over the studio now.  It'll be like a couple.  We've got to organize and get them back together.  Going out on a date, and they're going to be sitting like a mile away from each other.  Yeah.  He's sitting on the lawn, and she's being accosted by boxing corn fans. 
[01:12:00]  So outside the building at 850, 57th between 6th and 5th.  What?  The building's very upset.  We have to be closer to 6th Avenue to give away the tickets.  You know...  Whatever, dude.  Why don't we tell the building...  Whatever.  ...and that aborigine they hired to annoy us to shut their faces.  You're a building.  All right, well...  This is New York outside.  You don't own the outside.  How is the building angry?  They don't have emotion.  Exactly.  They're...  But mortar...  And...  And brick.  There's a building guy that stands there.  Make sure that we move away from the building after the show ends. 
[01:12:30]  It's so rich and fun to the city every day when we do a walk-off.  But not for nothing, when I went out to get some clothes for my other sinners.  Got three Wattics car.  Two on the bumper and one where the front license plate is supposed to be.  Well, he's a big fan.  He probably didn't put them on.  Oh, you think about it.  So, uh...  They're picking up the corn tickets.  We will give them out.  Why is he monitoring the show?  In a little over an hour.  What?  What is he doing?  He's monitoring the show.  Who is?  That guy.  Why?  Because he doesn't want us to give away the tickets in front of the building.  I don't think he's monitoring the show.  All right, well, we'll do...  We'll do... 
[01:13:00]  We're walking toward 57th and 6th, so maybe start gathering outside...  Stand...  Route 57.  Route 57.  We'll be in the revolving doors giving out tickets.  Stand in the revolving doors, and you have to run in a circle around the revolving door five times for your tickets.  You creep.  We're monitoring the show.  Work.  Get a job.  How do you find standing up on his front seat, that little fella?  That'd be day big.  We're putting Jimmy in like a leotard, and he's going to be skipping and throwing tickets as he goes. 
[01:13:30]  Right outside that fat lady statue outside the door.  The big, disgusting fat lady statue.  Naked.  We go to break.  We go to break with audio of Catherine McPhee.  Getting hotter by the second with every abdominal contraction.  Exclusive audio from Catherine McPhee as we go to break.  Catherine McPhee.  Naked appearances on American Idol. 
[01:14:00]  Catherine McPhee.  Exclusive audio.  The One virus spreading across America.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you want to change the locks?  See, I'll be there for the show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you, you help me, we all laugh.  Don't worry, we're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweeteness.  If you walk past them, don't you take your jewelry, take your purse, you know, you have no idea what they are. 
[01:14:30]  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaky now.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  This is the O.B. and Anthony show?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show.  On some fine CBS radio stations. 
[01:15:00]  And, of course, on the XM Nation as well.  On the XM Nation?  I don't know if that makes sense.  On XM, how's that?  Want to say hi to the XM Nation.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Now play pick-up ticks.  The intern has picked up all the tickets we're going to be giving away outside the building.  He's getting them back together.  And when we do the walk today, starting at about 855 right outside this fine building. 
[01:15:30]  57th Street between 6th and 5th, closer to 6th Avenue, so the building can calm the F down.  Yeah, calm down.  We got lots and lots of tickets to see Korn that we're giving away to our New York listeners.  A little thank you because they gave us some early, early good news in the ratings earlier this week.  O.B. and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio present Family Values Tour 2006 starring Korn, Deftone, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, and I never heard of these guys.  Doren Gray, something like that, Saturday, September 2nd at Jones Beach on Long Island. 
[01:16:00]  Doors, 1.30, show at 3.  Tickets start at $9.99 and are available Saturday.  That's tomorrow morning at 10 at all Ticketmaster outlets, FamilyValuesLive.com or Korn.com.  And we're going to be talking to Jonathan Davis at 8.30 this morning.  And like I said, we'll be giving away 100 pairs of tickets in a little over an hour right outside this building.  Why are we letting that awful little building man bully us? 
[01:16:30]  We have no choice.  We're being bullied?  Yeah.  Because he thinks he has real power.  He just stands out there with his, he looks like a little Luca Brozzi.  If you're listening right now, I want to spit my gum off your teeth.  What do you think of them apples, short stuff?  Well, he's monitoring the show.  He's monitoring it?  Monitoring.  He stands around the dashboard like a St. Anthony, a little creep.  I want to thank Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda. 
[01:17:00]  Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  That's how I say it.  We're giving all these asses power in New York City.  They were nobodies before 9-11.  Now they think they're really, really important that they're actually going to stop an Al-Qaeda attack in their building.  Doormen or like building security guys?  Building security guys.  They're just...  They're jokes.  They're jokes.  Same guy sees me every morning.  And if my car doesn't work properly, he gives me an attitude like today's the day I'm sneaking something into the building to take it down. 
[01:17:30]  That's why...  You're nobody.  Stop.  In the other building, I will not acknowledge the door guys.  They're not human beings to me.  I'll tell you why.  Because every day the guy would see me and then the one day I forgot my car and he wouldn't let me up.  He made me call someone to get me down.  Yeah.  So I literally, for five months after that, I saw him every day.  He would say good morning.  I wouldn't acknowledge.  Why not?  Why should we pretend we have a human relationship when that's the way you act?  When the first day my car...  I forget my car.  Why acknowledge you as a human? 
[01:18:00]  It's just a pain in the ass for us New Yorkers.  It's a false sense of security.  It means nothing.  These guys aren't going to stop anything if Al-Qaeda decides to attack their building.  Don't confuse them with doormen.  Doormen have the hats and the nice jackets and they look like they're from 1950.  And they go, yes, sir.  Welcome, sir.  You know, that's a doorman.  These are building security and they think they're actually part of this anti-terrorism iron...  Task force?  ...wall we have around the city. 
[01:18:30]  Are they part of the task force?  Part of the task force.  And they sit there.  And meanwhile, if there was ever a terrorist event at one of their buildings, they would be done as quickly as the security guy in the first Die Hard movie.  Right.  Just open the door and boom!  There's a guy downstairs.  Shoot him in the head, wheel him away, and he's done.  There's a guy downstairs when I arrive.  His job, his job, I'm going to break it down for everybody, is to listen for two beeps.  Yo, the listen for two beep guy. 
[01:19:00]  That's his job.  Yeah.  We have security cards.  We place it down.  If it doesn't beep twice, he gets to yell at you.  And say, it didn't go.  And say, do it again.  That's his whole job.  And you have to keep swiping your card until it goes, beep, beep.  Oh, now I can go.  You sure made Dad proud, didn't you?  Too beep guy.  He's too beep guy.  That's his whole gig.  Mm-hmm.  And if it only goes once, he gets to yell, and he does.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, try that again.  Just imagine, if you will, a terrorist walks in, swipes something, and it only beeps once. 
[01:19:30]  The guy goes, you can't come in.  And the terrorist has to leave.  He has foiled a plot that could have cost people their lives.  In the words of Jimmy Norton, did he?  Did he really?  No.  They're not.  And you're, hey, I'm just doing my job.  Yeah?  Then do it.  Let's not pretend we're exchanging human pleasantries.  Yeah, thank you, Al-Qaeda.  We get this false sense of security because of you guys. 
[01:20:00]  Thanks.  We greatly appreciate it.  Sign in.  Sign in.  How about this?  Sign in.  Whenever I have to sign in, I don't think I have ever, ever signed in under my real name.  I have put everything from Fred Flintstone to Buzz Aldrin on the various signing things.  Because they don't look.  They don't know.  They don't care.  It's a joke because let's say Al-Qaeda does, you know, go to your building and take it down or what have you. 
[01:20:30]  But thank God they got the book where everyone signed in because I'm sure the Al-Qaeda guys are going to give me their real names.  Right.  You asses.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my Allah.  Sorry.  I have signed in under my real name.  Right.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mike.  What's happening, men?  Hey.  What's happening, men?  Hey.  I got a nice article here in the Boston Herald today for you guys.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It says, Opie and Anthony helped WBCN crawl out of Roth's cellar. 
[01:21:00]  Well, let's get that article.  I want to read it.  Roth's cellar?  Yeah.  It's by Jessica Hellslam.  And it says basically that you guys need to beat Matty Siegel of all people.  I would love to take out Matty Siegel.  Who's Matty Siegel?  I don't know who he is.  He's like, he's the joke up there in Boston.  I think he's at the top of the pile, right?  Yeah.  I think he might be Greg Hill's father because he's another one market sensation.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do Mantown, right?  Damn it.  That was so easy.  No, that's the purpose of Mantown, to get the gays from KISS 108 to go over to WAF. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  All right.  Well, we'll take a look at the Boston Herald today.  Thanks, Mike.  No problem.  What's Matty?  Also, we did an interview for Reuters, and that's out today.  I don't know if it's linked on – well, we can't say our website, which is completely ridiculous.  But go to our website.  It's pretty much the name of the radioshow.com.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But Reuters came in yesterday.  She had a lot of fun.  She was really digging the show.  Mm-hmm.  And then we talked to her for about an hour after the show, and the article's two paragraphs.  I don't even know why we bother. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  Maybe three paragraphs.  I don't know.  Is it a good one?  I don't know.  It's really good.  It's very positive and all, but it's boring as hell, to be honest with you.  Didn't we do an AP?  Mm-hmm.  Where's that?  We did an AP article.  We're doing the New York Post today, the Washington Post today.  We are today?  Yeah, because we start on WJFK on Monday in Washington.  Ooh.  All right.  Some more interesting news stories.  Here we go.  This is a big story today.  A big story.  Major League Baseball fined Guillen for his use of a homosexual slur directed at Chicago Sun-Times columnist Jay Mariotti. 
[01:22:30]  Although he remains unapologetic about the tirade directed at Mariotti, he has offered an apology for using the word in question.  Nonetheless, baseball ordered Guillen to undergo sensitivity training, which he was asked about Thursday afternoon.  What is supposedly sensitivity training?  What are you going to do?  I didn't even know what he was saying.  I don't know when to school.  I've got to ask the PR department what I have to do. 
[01:23:00]  I think I'm going to have to sit with Joe Cora a couple of hours before the games and try to learn.  You know, I'm not going to change.  I'm not going to change.  I'm going to learn something I should be learning.  One thing I'm going to make it clear, I apologize to the community, but to Jay, you know, I have no chance.  This thing is on, and it's on for good.  And Jay, to me, Jay, I'm going to make him bigger, his name is bigger, but if Jay thinks I'm going to back off of him and say,  I was here a couple of minutes ago, I had to apologize to him. 
[01:23:30]  Please.  How about they make him take an English course?  Screw sensitivity training.  How about English training?  How do you not love Ozzy Guillen, though?  He's like, yeah, all right, I'll do it, but that's exactly the attitude.  I don't even know what the hell this is.  Sensitivity.  What is sensitivity training for a gay slur?  Does that involve somebody putting on a rubber glove?  They're going to test you out a little?  Stinks.  Stop taking our slurs away from us, please.  Unbelievable.  We love using slurs.  We always have. 
[01:24:00]  That isn't even, because what word did he use?  I'm guessing fag or faggot.  I think he said fag.  Fag.  He just said fag.  Fag isn't a gay slur.  And fag is like the at this point.  It isn't even a gay slur.  I'm sure gay people will say it is.  But please, it's not your word.  It's a word that guys use when one of your friends is punking out.  He's being an ass.  He doesn't want to go out.  You know, you go over, you call up your friend.  You go, yeah, what are you doing tonight? 
[01:24:30]  You want to hang out?  You want to go out?  You want to do this?  Nah, I'm going to hang out at home.  Don't be a faggot.  Get in your car.  Get out.  That's right.  Stop being a homosexual.  Right.  Stop being a homosexual.  The word faggot is taking on a different meaning.  We're all so sensitive.  Don't worry about it.  Exactly.  We're so sensitive.  And is there a human resource department in Major League Baseball now?  I'm wondering about that.  Sensitivity training. 
[01:25:00]  You got to be sensitive.  Do we?  Using the word retarded.  That really helps me.  When you say, don't be retarded.  That's retarded.  That is retarded.  No one's thinking that it's, you know, retarded in the old school slur for somebody that's  mentally deficient.  You just, it means it's screwed up.  It's retarded.  Retarded just means slowed or whatever.  So it's not a vicious term. 
[01:25:30]  Like I tried to do that.  I wanted to do this one joke and they wouldn't let me do it on TV where I said, yeah, I saw  this retarded baby and wanted to punch it.  And they said it was slow.  He's retarded.  You know, some of these words, though, don't mean, they don't, don't take it so literally.  Look at the context it's in.  When you call someone a faggot, look at the context.  Is the guy actually gay?  Are you commenting and using that word because he is involved in something that perhaps only 
[01:26:00]  a gay person would be involved in?  An activity, an event, a parade, and then you're yelling faggot.  That, yeah, that's a slur.  That's something that isn't right.  People would get upset about it.  Fine.  If you're hanging out in here or with a group of your friends and you say, stop being a  faggot.  It doesn't mean.  Right.  Travis will poke his head up and go, what?  Keep your head down there. 
[01:26:30]  Here's something.  Let people say whatever the hell they want.  Hey, easy.  Yes.  Let them say whatever they want.  Enough.  Sensitivity training.  Enough.  And get rid of human resources at companies, please.  They're helpful, though.  And building security.  They stink.  They're a bunch of faggots.  This human resource that's involved with radio.  Oh, God.  Give me a break.  That's why we have no chick interns.  Why?  That's right.  Because we don't want to take a chance. 
[01:27:00]  We've been asked.  We've been asked.  Why don't you guys have any girl interns?  Why?  You think we want the lawsuit?  You think we want the aggravation after she's done and six months later?  You're getting served with papers because she heard things that were sexually suggestive.  She was approached.  They come up with all these things because we throw around.  You know, if you spoke to a girl intern the way we speak to these interns, forget about it.  Forget it.  We'd be sunk. 
[01:27:30]  How about that stupid Friends writer, the woman who sued because she said that she was being harassed?  Dumb, broad, token writer.  I'm sure she was a great comedy writer.  I'm sure she was.  Oh, hoot.  I'm sure she cracked everybody in the writing room up.  And then how about Rachel can come in and go, oh, guys.  All right.  Let's move on to another story.  This show's moving way too fast today.  Another great story from today.  A really creepy story about a stalker hiding under a woman's bed and it's caught on camera. 
[01:28:00]  Now, cops say Carlos Faria stayed under his victim's bed near Washington, D.C. for two days, videotaping her every move.  Now, he was a valet at the hospital where she worked.  Cops say he made a copy of her keys and let himself into her home and stayed there.  They say the stalking came to an end when the victim's fiancee discovered Faria under the bed, then called police. 
[01:28:30]  That stuff creeps me out, man.  How does this guy still breathe if the fiancee found him under the bed?  You don't call the police in that instance.  You kill the guy.  You kill him.  Was the guy out of there for two straight days without leaving?  Yeah, I guess so.  Two days videotaping her.  That is weird.  You're setting the camera.  You got the keys to her place.  Why, when you set the camera?  And leave?  I'm not even going to acknowledge it.  It's wrong. 
[01:29:00]  But I'm just going.  But you want it logistically.  He screwed up.  Obviously, it's wrong.  But let's get inside this creep's head.  It's like you have the keys and you're going to set the camera.  Set the camera.  Get the hell out of there.  Get enough footage.  Go back and get your stupid camera.  Did he go to the bathroom under there?  What do you do?  How do you do for two days?  Maybe when she left, he would get up.  He's showering, making eggs.  God only knows what he's doing.  The video's hilarious because you see him set the camera really fast and then run away  from the camera and duck under the bed.  Where did he put the camera? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was one of those spy cameras.  I don't know exactly how he did that.  Oh, yeah.  You know he must have been, you know, she gets up, he gets out, does what he's got to  do.  But I'm sure we'll find out if they do any follow-ups that he was just doing awful  things to her personal goods, you know, going through the undies drawer or maybe the  laundry.  What a nut to be under the wall.  The fiance's in the house.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's definitely creepy.  Two days, you look under, you see these brown toes. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, is this the building guy?  Aborigine.  But the fiance, you know, finding a guy under your chick's bed like that, you'd have to  work him over before you call the cops.  I wonder if you did.  They didn't say anything.  Work him over?  You'd have to just, like, tune him up a little bit, grab a stick, and just beat him.  Silly.  Silly.  All right.  Let's say hi to Terry in New Jersey.  Terry, what's up?  Creep.  Terry. 
[01:30:30]  We lose you?  Terry.  Oh, hold on.  Or maybe a button.  A button.  Terry.  Hi.  Terry.  I don't know what's going on.  Name of either gender.  Hello?  Name of either gender.  All right.  You're going to have to call back, I guess.  You're taking your chances with a Terry.  Hi, Terry.  Hi.  Hi, Terry.  Hi.  Your Aunt Jerry.  J-E-R-R-I.  Short Jerry.  Geraldine.  That or lesbian, it's abbreviated for.  More info on that story.  He also had condoms on him and rubber gloves.  Oh.  He's a good boy.  That sounds like he might have been gearing up to do something. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  And continuing with the perv subject.  Operation Perv was a success here in New York City.  Do you remember the story of the guy that was flashing on the subway?  He wasn't just flashing.  He was.  He was working it.  He was.  What were you saying the other day?  It moved so fast that.  Oh.  It was really funny.  You had a very good visual.  Anyway.  What did I say day to day?  Yeah.  You had this perv.  He was a restaurant owner.  He was on the subway and he flashed and did some other things. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  In a car that had him and this Asian woman, I guess?  Yeah.  Some Asian girl was walking around and walked into that car and he was sitting there in the  seat and he was doing things to himself.  So she picked up her cell phone and went click.  Snapped a picture.  And this dope sees her pull out the camera and thinks she's taking a picture because like  she's digging it.  That's what he said.  That she was like digging it. 
[01:32:00]  Not thinking, hey idiot.  Do you know where this picture is going?  It went everywhere.  It ended up on the front page of the papers in New York.  Could you imagine?  Hope it ruined his life.  Oh, it did.  Get it really?  Yeah.  Lost his restaurant.  Well, the headline is perv.  Zip it.  You're busted.  Ooh, zip it.  I get it.  13 snared in subway sting.  This is an epidemic.  You want to talk about infestation?  Screw my mice.  Yeah.  This is happening like crazy on the subway. 
[01:32:30]  Subway perverts.  Beware.  Your next flashing or groping victim could be a cop.  Police conducted a sting last month dubbed Operation Exposure.  Operation Exposure, a Quinn Martin production that netted a dirty dozen plus one.  So they got 13 in 36 hours.  13 guys they got flashing on the subway in 36 hours.  What was it called?  Operation Exposure. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, that was kind of Brady-like, wasn't it?  Yeah.  I hate my new machine here.  Oh, don't be a goose.  It's all different from what I'm used to.  Come here.  Oh.  So that's about it.  They got 13.  All right.  What was it called?  Operation Exposure.  No, that doesn't seem to be it.  All right.  You want to take another shot of that?  What was it called?  Operation Exposure.  Operation Exposure.  Operation Exposure. 
[01:33:30]  No.  No.  That wasn't the right one.  Operation Exposure.  There you go.  No.  Yes, that one's a good one.  Let's go to Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I love that guy in there.  I think what he was doing, he was using his invisible hammer.  Oh, that's right.  Working his hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa.  What?  I'm pulling back in the reins.  We're trying to keep it on the air.  Oh, that's what it is.  Anthony described it as someone working an invisible hammer. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  That's a great one.  I was thinking before, Operation Exposure.  Jeez.  Nothing?  All right, we'll break.  Operation Exposure?  Operation Exposure.  No, that's a different operation up there in the Pacific Northwest. 
[01:34:30]  I've seen the video.  The guy doesn't make it.  Operation Intestinal Removal.  All right, here we go.  Lucky boy.  When we get back, we do news teases,  and we're going to try to add some more news teases to the News Tease Hall of Fame.  But first, do you want to go see the ONA Traveling Virus at PNC Bank Art Center on August 26th?  Yes, yes.  Featuring all the comics that you know and love from this show  and the ONA Village with dunking boots  and hopefully the Ultimate Wet T-shirt contest.  Maybe catfights. 
[01:35:00]  We're going to look into that now.  How do we do it?  How do we do it?  How, Ope?  Well, if you want tickets to the PNC Bank Art Center show on August 26th,  text the word virus now to 69923.  The 90-second text message wins a pair of tickets to the comedy event of 2006.  Once again, text now virus to 69923.  That's also NY923.  Wait, how does that work?  If I want to vote for Taylor.  Brought to you by Bud Light. 
[01:35:30]  Standard text messaging rates apply,  and transportation is not provided for out-of-area winners.  Tickets are still on sale now at Ticketmaster.com,  and you can get the lineups for the Opie and Anthony comedy show as well at Ticketmaster.com.  When it says text like that, like, are you just actually hitting those four digits?  I don't know how that works.  I've seen that.  Is that simple?  It's called the future, Jimmy.  No, no, I know I had a text message,  but when it says text to four numbers, that's not a phone number.  No.  No, that's just how it goes.  That's how it works.  Yeah, so just text virus right now to 69923 
[01:36:00]  for your chance to win a pair of tickets to the O&A traveling virus.  You got something?  Operation Exposure just in time.  Operation Exposure.  Operation Exposure.  All right.  Wait really fast, because I don't think we need to waste more time on this.  Before we take a break, the audio of Operation Exposure.  Almost worked.  The NYPD is cracking down on lewd behavior on New York City subways.  13 men have been arrested for indecent or sexual misconduct. 
[01:36:30]  while riding on subway trains.  The undercover crackdown called Operation Exposure took place last month  and was prompted by recent incidents.  They were captured by cell phone cameras.  The men arrested range in the age of 21 to 58.  You hope it was an undercover operation,  because if you're arrested by a uniformed officer doing that,  you are a true sexual.  No kidding.  Okay.  Operation Exposure.  Oh, hey. 
[01:37:00]  Thank God.  By the way, that wasn't happening in New York City.  It was happening in...  Mantown.  Mantown.  Operation Exposure in Mantown.  You were arrested if your zipper was closed.  All right.  Don't forget about the corn tickets.  Lots and lots of corn tickets to give away right outside this building  when we end the first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just get your ass to 57th Street and, like, 6th Avenue, okay?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  O&A virus spreading across America.  Stay tuned for more Radio Awesome.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live,  continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio,  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony show.  A very busy morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:38:00]  The Opie and Anthony virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Make sure you keep telling people that we're back,  trying to make the biggest comeback in radio history.  Well on our way, I think.  Yeah, we got a nice interview from Reuters.  Opie and Anthony, early rating show, audience gains.  I think the article is up on our website.  In an interview with Reuters,  Opie and Anthony said they loved the challenge of making edgier shows for terrestrial radio  and believed they were drawing many former Stern listeners.  You can still do a very entertaining and edgy show on regular radio. 
[01:38:30]  He, Stern, just was not able to adapt to the new FCC rules.  It's more work to keep it clever, said Anthony Cumia.  I did.  Instead of going right for that off-color, non-compliant joke,  you have to try to keep it funny and entertaining with the boundaries, he said.  I don't remember saying any of that, and I won't fess up to it.  Yeah, they adjust what we say, by the way.  We said something like that. 
[01:39:00]  I think we said that Howard's a hack that couldn't adapt,  and they made it a little friendlier.  Yeah.  In general, we feel like we're talking to the same people on both shows,  but it's a little more of a hardcore following on XM, said Anthony Cumia.  I'm sure he's, Stern, not happy that we're making a difference.  There's a lot of audience that's sunk into the radio landscape  who are looking for something, said Hughes.  I didn't say that.  Referring to the millions of Stern listeners who did not sign up for satellite radio. 
[01:39:30]  XM called the deal a success as well.  We're getting enormous branding and exposure for XM,  said Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan.  The benefit to XM subscribers is that they get the uncensored show.  I think we're turning new people onto XM,  which is translating into new subscribers, said Anthony Cumia.  I did.  Ugh.  I don't remember that either.  We didn't say it like that.  By the way, before we end the first half of the Opie and Anthony show,  can we get No Filter Paul on the phone? 
[01:40:00]  I hear that he's celebrating his birthday with Big A at the restaurant.  Yeah.  At FH Riley's in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington,  right there in the village.  It's my brother's restaurant.  I'm there all the time.  It's like a family affair.  Anthony's there from time to time.  And I'm hearing No Filter Paul is celebrating his birthday with Big A.  And he's buying everyone's dinner, by the way.  He's buying everyone's dinner.  He's buying drinks.  I find that hard to believe.  Are you going?  I don't think so. 
[01:40:30]  What, Saturday?  You were invited.  Trust me.  He's inviting the whole world.  And he's telling my brother, be prepared for like 100 people.  I mean, this is a real business.  So, you know, I want to find out how many people he's actually bringing to the restaurant this weekend.  If I have to go, I'll go.  I think you should represent the show.  No Filter Paul is kind of a pain in the ass.  It's a Saturday affair, I think.  He's a real dolt.  I might go.  It's Saturday, and I think it's actually going to start on Friday. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  So I'm trying to find out what the hell's going on.  But FH Riley's is a good place.  400 New York Avenue, if you're ever in the Huntington Village area.  Yes.  All right?  My brother does a great job over there.  You want to do some news teases?  Love the news teases.  We got Jonathan Davis calling in in a few minutes.  Oh, party with surprise for Big A.  Oops.  Are you kidding?  Good.  Ruin his surprise party.  It's not like Big A listens to every minute of the show. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, he'll never hear this.  Well, someone maybe should have told me this ahead of time.  It was a surprise party for Big A.  They were going to bring him out there for dinner, I guess.  And all of a sudden, it's like, surprise, the whole restaurant goes nuts.  Do you think that's going to make him feel any better about himself?  It would have.  I don't know.  All right, well.  I have a surprise party.  If you want to go to Big A's surprise party, go to 400 New York Avenue, FH Riley's, in the Huntington Village.  And yell, surprise, fat boy.  Here's going to be the greatest surprise.  Guys, now cancel the party and don't tell him. 
[01:42:00]  Exactly.  Let him show up.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Like Peter Brady.  He's running into places looking for his party.  With a stupid suit on.  I want my brother, if he's listening, big sign out outside of FH Riley's.  Close tonight because of lack of interest.  All right, really fast before Jonathan Davis calls.  Big A's surprise party, excuse me, is going to be a flop, of course. 
[01:42:30]  Don't forget, in about a half hour, we'll be outside this building with 100 pairs of tickets to see corn September 2nd at Jones Beach.  57th Street around 6th Avenue, okay?  Yes.  We'll just hand them out as we walk.  Okay, News Tease Hall of Fame.  We've got to do this.  We've got a lot to go through.  It's going to take us a few days.  But so far, where's my thing?  What thing?  Where's my thing with the News Teases?  Oh, here we go.  E-Rock made it very easy for me. 
[01:43:00]  The News Tease Hall of Fame.  All those scary News Teases.  We collect them and then we make a Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  We've got these three so far.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  Frightening.  Boy, does that have, that earned its spot in the Hall of Fame.  It's got all the features.  It's quick, it's scary, and it's something so common that everybody gets the hiccups.  So it really covers a lot of ground there.  Very good, very scary.  It's in. 
[01:43:30]  All right, here's the second one that made the Hall of Fame.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Another one.  Just so ridiculous.  It was such huge ramifications there.  A twist on the predator law, shut down religion.  Right.  That's a bold statement.  And the third member of the News Tease Hall of Fame, also the greatest News Tease to date.  Yeah.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area. 
[01:44:00]  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  The greatest one ever.  Huge.  Right next to your house.  So we got a few to, oh man, then we're going to have to take a break before we talk to Jonathan Davis.  This is like catch-up morning.  We're just playing catch-up the whole morning.  Yeah.  All right, so let's play a few of these and see if they're worthy of, is that him right now?  Who's on the hotline?  Hotline.  Jonathan?  Is he calling early? 
[01:44:30]  What?  Ten minutes.  Oh, ten minutes.  What?  What?  What happened?  What happened?  All right, so we'll play some scary News Teases and we'll decide right now if they're worthy of being inducted into the Hall of Fame, okay?  Here's the first one.  And keeping summer fun safe.  What you need to hear before letting your child back in the pool.  Hmm.  No.  That's not that bad.  That's actually okay.  That's kind of, ugh.  I wasn't supposed to play that one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I screwed up big. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, you're a doll.  I'm sorry.  It was this one.  Tomorrow at 5, from your microwave to your dryer, hidden dangers in household appliances you use every day, which you should know tomorrow on Fox 5 News at 5.  That's a good one.  Not Hall of Fame.  But not Hall of Fame.  Not scary enough.  It said hidden danger.  Hidden danger.  Death.  And they mentioned a couple of items that I could think off the top of my head that they can be dangerous in a certain way.  So it's not all that ridiculous.  They're trying to scare you.  Being a little sensationalistic there, but... 
[01:45:30]  By the way, people are hating that you're eating right now.  Are they?  Yeah.  Too bad.  Too bad.  Too bad.  They don't like that they can hear it?  Huh?  They can hear it?  Yeah, they can hear it.  Well...  All right, here's the next one.  You all eat.  I would have eaten earlier if the goddamn diner opened up before 8 in the morning in this stupid city.  So I apologize.  The worst thing you could do is, like, send in an instant feedback complaining about noises that we're making. 
[01:46:00]  Because then you'll just hear them.  It's oatmeal.  Oh, that is so disgusting.  He wasn't that upset.  He just said, holy S, holy S.  Jimmy, clear your nose and stop eating on mic, you no-chin, fat boobie a-hole.  All right, here we go.  The next scary news tease. 
[01:46:30]  Let's see if this is good enough for the Hall of Fame.  Are thousands living next to a ticking time bomb ready to send a toxic cloud into the air?  That's good.  That's good?  That's good.  These have to be exceptional, though.  That is at least very close.  Because it's very scary, very dangerous.  No location.  Are thousands living next to a ticking time bomb?  Ticking time bomb.  There's no way to defend against it.  Toxic cloud?  Toxic cloud ticking time bomb.  Ooh, I'm scared.  Thousands? 
[01:47:00]  Are we living there?  That might make it.  That's pretty scary.  I apologize.  You guys got to help us out on the instant feedback and do a quick yes or no.  I wish the guy put a little more oomph into it.  I say no.  Why?  It has to be just so over the top that you have no problem hearing it a million times like the Sex Offender one.  That one's good.  Might win next year.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I think we have better ones.  I'd give it a Hall of Fame one.  Not the best, but I would give it a nod. 
[01:47:30]  Yes or no, guys?  It's all right.  It's all right.  Yeah, I'm thinking real close, but just misses.  Let's say just misses on that one.  All right.  Here's the next scary news.  Honorable mention.  Just getting started.  Imagine going for a walk with your dog and wondering if you'd make it home alive.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  See, is that better than the Toxic Cloud?  Yeah, that is great.  That is all right.  Is that the same woman that did the Sex Offender thing or no?  They all sound the same, don't they? 
[01:48:00]  Everyone's saying no to the other one, by the way.  No.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Did you guys like that one?  Imagine going for a walk and not coming home alive.  But you're coming home dead?  Yeah, you come home dead.  Where's the dog drag your corpse back to the front door?  Where's your owner?  He's dead!  What do you think?  Yes or no on that one?  Yeah, I like that one.  You like that?  Yeah, I say vote it in.  We don't want, I mean, we have about 40 to go through in the coming weeks. 
[01:48:30]  So, I mean, we, you know, it has to be completely over the top.  You like that one?  I like it.  Let's narrow it down to a field of possibilities.  That's a good idea.  See, I have a lot of ideas.  Ooh.  Yes.  And then we can let the listeners vote on it.  All right, so we'll, that one's in consideration, okay?  Yeah.  Here's the next one.  Plus, aren't kids supposed to be safe in their own beds?  It was horrifying to wake up and see my son just laying there with blood all over him. 
[01:49:00]  A little boy shot in his sleep.  No.  That isn't really, that's a news story.  No.  That isn't really a news tease.  And they told you what happened.  Yeah.  If they didn't say a little boy shot in his sleep, that would have been the greatest one ever.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, unfortunately, they actually did their job on that one.  Yeah.  All right, yeah, because it's got to scare everybody and all that stuff.  All right, how about this one?  And are ex-cons walking the hallways of your child's school?  The shocking results of surprise background checks. 
[01:49:30]  No parent should miss this report next.  Hmm.  No.  No?  I don't give it a induction.  All right, let's go right to the next one here.  Scary news tease is trying to figure out if they're good enough for the Hall of Fame.  Sunset.  Daylight fades.  Everything is calm.  And then it happens.  Nighttime boating deaths skyrocketing in Minnesota.  Why?  The Fox 9 investigators go on patrol after dark using night vision to show you the dangerous 
[01:50:00]  boaters aren't seeing.  Wednesday on Fox 9 News at 9.  Wow, that is an action movie.  What do you think?  I like the production.  They got the music going.  Death right there in the whole thing.  Boating death.  I like it.  Consideration?  You know what we'll do?  We'll throw these up on the website, you know, when we get them all organized and then  let the listeners decide.  What's that, then?  Huh?  If you cut it right after, like, nighttime boating deaths, I think it would be particularly  effective.  Yeah, yeah, but we can't, you know, edit these down to make them sound better. 
[01:50:30]  We don't want to add a lot to the Hall of Fame.  I mean, it's got to be a no-brainer.  I say no to that one.  I think it's good, though, but not...  Yeah, I say no to that one, too.  Yeah, okay, I'm overruled.  Well, we're like American Idol here.  That's right.  Well, if we don't agree, we just kiss it out.  Here we go.  And I happen to be the one that agrees with everything.  Extra Virgin Ollie Boy.  Are you getting what you pay for?  Tomorrow at 6, I with this news investigator, Sarah Wallace, exposes a company selling  what may not be the real thing.  It's not 100% extra virgin olive oil. 
[01:51:00]  Plus, a simple way to test the purity of your olive oil.  Boring.  Boring.  Yeah, how you say test if your olive oil is a version, you look to see if it's broken.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, virgin olive oil.  My, uh, my olive oil is acting like a brush oil.  All right, one more, then we've got to take a break, because Jonathan Davis is going to  call any second now from Korn, okay?  Uh, one more for consideration for today.  A backyard accident nearly killed this local girl.  A hidden danger exposed at 11. 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  Yep, that's a girl.  I don't know if it's Hall of Fame, but that's not Hall of Fame.  It's typical, though.  Why won't you tell us what the action is?  It's too just blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, he's like, man, man, man, man, man, man.  All right, let's go for another one.  We've got to, you know, leave on an up note here.  An up note.  This might be it.  This mom was perfectly healthy.  Suddenly, she was in a coma.  Are tampons really to blame?  Yeah, come on.  We know the story.  Obviously, it's toxic shock, but the presentation itself, I think it makes it worthy of at least 
[01:52:00]  consideration by our audience.  All right, are you sure that's toxic shock?  Gotta be.  I heard her husband wanted something.  She goes, no, I'm on my...  All right, we can leave it right there.  We found a few for consideration for the News Tees Hall of Fame.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll talk to Jonathan Davis of Korn next.  And don't forget, 100 pairs of tickets to give away in less than a half hour right outside  this building to see Korn Family Values Tour, September 2nd, Jones Beach. 
[01:52:30]  Tickets go on sale tomorrow morning.  But we have your tickets today if you join us here in New York City, 57th Street, around  6th Avenue, okay?  Right.  All right.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, here's a little piece of the Opie and Anthony Show you might have missed this  week.  If you were being sm...  Come on, give it up for Korn. 
[01:53:00]  Coming Undone from the album.  See you on the other side.  Don't forget, in about 15 minutes, we're going to be outside this building giving away 100  pairs of tickets to see Korn as part of the Family Values Tour. 
[01:53:30]  That's going to be at Jones Beach, September 2nd.  Excuse me.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow morning through Ticketmaster.com or LiveNation.com for more info.  And on the phone right now, the lead singer of Korn, of course, Jonathan Davis.  Jonathan.  What's up, man?  He's calling from L.A.  It's got to be early there, huh?  It's early, dude.  Yeah.  It's what?  Oh, my God.  It's 540.  What are you doing?  You haven't gone to bed yet, I guess.  No, I was in bed. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  How are you feeling?  I feel great, dude.  Well, you had that blood thing going on.  Yeah.  It sucked, man.  I'm still working on that.  He got me on medicine and stuff that's making me better.  So I'm good to go.  Did you guys hear what happened?  All of a sudden, he's getting bruises all over his body.  And if it continued, what?  You could have died on stage?  Yeah.  Jesus.  He just started getting the bruises, and he's like, what the hell is this?  Like stigmata?  And I bet you, just like any other guy out there, you're like, ah, it'll cure itself.  And you probably went to the doctor, like, last minute, right? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I just saw these bruises all over me, and I was like, what the hell is going on?  I'm not hitting myself.  And so I just called the doctor.  He said, well, go to this doctor.  It's probably nothing.  And so I went in and took some blood, went to the hotel room.  He said, I'll get to the hospital.  I was like, okay.  Yeah, he could have had a brain hemorrhage at any time.  Jonathan Davis stars on House.  An all-new House.  A man comes in with bruises and starts bleeding from the brain.  House must kill four other musicians to save this one. 
[01:55:00]  God, I hate that show.  I even hate Jonathan talking about this because now I'm getting the heebie-jeebies,  and I'm a hypochondriac, and I think I'm going to get this.  Now every bruise I get, I'm going to be like, ah, ah, got to go to the hospital.  Yeah, I got a huge bruise on my arm, but that was –  Go to the hospital quick.  But that was self-inflicted the other day, Jonathan.  I got bite marks on my arm because I was so –  What did you do?  You know, we were so –  Oh, you bit yourself out of –  We were so frustrated at XM that I bit myself,  and now it's a really nice bruise on my arm.  But you're feeling better.  You got a couple more weeks, and then you're going right back on the road, right? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the family values coming to Jones Beach September 2nd.  I can't say 2nd today.  Oh, no.  What does that mean?  You're having a stroke.  Oh, yeah.  That's so scary.  Hey, Jonathan, we started about the same time as you, you know.  You used to do a lot of those shows for us at WAF in Boston.  Yeah.  We – Anthony and I were just getting going as a radio show,  and you guys were just starting to blow up.  And we used to have a lot of fun with you guys backstage taping stuff for that Real Rock TV thing. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  God, I forgot about that.  Remember that?  That was when, you know, Korn, you know, was just starting to blow up.  Yeah.  Now they're not taping for Real Rock TV anytime soon.  I saw you guys years ago, man.  You toured with Ozzy.  What year was that?  That was 96, I believe.  That was the first time I heard of Korn.  Of course it was because there's the Ozzy tie, and Jimmy loves Ozzy.  He just – Black Sabbath, Ozzy.  That's the best place to see hot bands, man.  Ozzy's always got, like, the band that's going to be, like, the next day. 
[01:56:30]  It was Metallica he brought years ago, Motley Crue, Korn.  He always brings out the big great bands.  Yeah, he always brings really good bands out.  That was a fun tour.  That tour we did was Korn and Deftones in Ozzy.  Wow.  How was Ozzy's behavior?  Was he a drunken mess the whole time?  No, man.  He was cool as all hell.  Oh, was he silver back then?  Yeah, I think he was silver then.  Oh, wow.  And it was fun, man.  I remember when we first got our first gold record.  I was on that tour, and he came in to him, and Sharon came in with a big old bucket full of champagne and everything, 
[01:57:00]  and gave us all this alcohol and to have fun.  Ozzy comes over.  Yeah, nice.  That's Ozzy's in my district.  Oh, my gosh.  It was freaky.  How do you guys get along as a band after so many years together now?  Well, can I add to that question?  Oh, go ahead, Opie.  Add to it.  No, because I was going to ask something similar, too.  I mean, I love Korn.  I continue to love Korn.  I got to be honest with you, though.  When What's-His-Name left to be a Christian, I'm like, oh, boy. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, boy.  The band is jumping the shark now.  They're jumping the shark.  But you guys survived that, and you continue to make great music, and you're still selling out wherever you go.  Yeah.  As I said, the relationship is a band.  It's stronger than ever, I think.  When Head left us, it really shook us up, and we realized how much fun we have together,  how much we love making music together.  Did you see the signs with him?  No.  He was really, really depressed. 
[01:58:00]  He turned into a born again, Jimmy.  Yeah.  No, he wasn't born again because he was really jacked up on drugs, and that's what helped him get clean.  Yeah, whatever it takes, I guess.  Whatever it takes, and I'm not going to beg on that.  It's just that we love him to death.  He went over there to Babylon or wherever you do it and got baptized in the river there and everything.  Why did he leave the band?  Why not just be born again and keep playing?  Because he got really, really into it, and he thought that that's what God wanted him to do. 
[01:58:30]  So, you know, and he was missing his daughter because he was a single parent, so he's always  having to leave and go on the road, and his baby was with his mom, and there was just a  lot of things going on, a lot of issues going on with him.  Does Korn live a sinful life when you're out on the road?  Of course.  Sinful life.  A sinful life.  Yeah.  There's all kinds of things going on.  You don't have to.  It's just up to each individual person, but.  Yeah.  No.  Nice way to cover for the other guys.  Good job.  Good job. 
[01:59:00]  Don't want to make it sound like everybody's out there.  Yeah, so now he's doing.  He's doing, like, Christian music and stuff like that now?  I guess.  I mean, I haven't heard it.  Well, from what I've heard before, it's not really, like, you know, a traditional Christian  kind of music.  Yeah.  He's an amazing, amazing musician, so I know whatever he does is going to be good.  Yeah, he's just doing his own thing, and you guys survived that big time.  Yeah.  You a married man, are you?  Or are you single?  No, I'm married.  Oh, okay.  I never understood why somebody in a band would get married.  I would just kill to have that kind of access to women. 
[01:59:30]  Well, were you married when, you know, the band kind of hit, or?  Or, um, no, when the band hit, I wasn't, I was, um, with my first son's mom, and then  we got married, and that lasted, like, four months.  Oh, gotcha.  Wow.  Yeah.  Pay day for her.  You've got to stick together.  Yeah.  It was a big pay day for her.  Believe me.  I know.  Anthony knows.  I feel that pain, man.  I was a construction worker when I got married.  I was a very well-paid DJ when I got divorced. 
[02:00:00]  Guess what the court took into consideration?  When they gave her money.  Not my tin-knocking skills.  Not my future earnings as a guy that installs air conditioning units.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Hold it together.  It's amazing.  For your bank account's sake.  It's amazing what women get away with with these divorces.  So.  I know.  It's amazing.  I woke up and found bruises on my bank book. 
[02:00:30]  And realized it was very sick.  God damn.  Yeah.  You guys seem to have a pretty good sense of humor.  I remember the cartoon you did.  What was that for?  South Park?  South Park.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God damn.  Was that funny?  Where they were like superheroes.  One of those old 70s type cartoons.  You must have grown up watching those.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of cool to be a cartoon.  It was cool doing that.  Yeah.  It was fun.  I had a good time. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  You could tell you guys have that kind of twisted sense of humor.  Very cool.  Dude.  We were just cracking up the whole time.  Yeah.  How happy were you when Sabbath got inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  When Sabbath did?  Yeah.  I was happy.  It was great, right?  That was cool.  Finally get recognized.  Do you love Sabbath and Ozzy as much as our own Jim Norton?  I like Ozzy.  I wasn't a big Sabbath fan, but I mean, it's cool.  It was Zeppelin over Sabbath, right? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, definitely Zeppelin over Sabbath.  Absolutely.  No, it wasn't.  Jimmy doesn't like you anymore.  I just don't like him.  It's fine.  He's entitled to his opinions.  He's going to put placebos in your medication bottles.  Look out.  That's all right.  Jimmy doesn't like you now because if you don't like Sabbath, Jimmy doesn't like you.  It's just the way he is.  He's a twisted ass who thinks, he said The Who was an overrated band.  Dude, I don't say they stink.  I don't think they stink.  I just think they were overrated.  Overrated?  Compared to Sabbath, yes, they were overrated.  How do you say they're overrated compared to any band? 
[02:02:00]  How do I say they're overrated?  I don't know.  Listen to Symptom of the Universe and then listen to Who are you?  Who are you?  He always picks that song.  How about Tommy?  Stinks.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Tommy, a rock opera.  Nobody wants that crap.  Nobody.  He sounds like he's ready to chase some kids off his lawn.  Jonathan, we got to explain.  Nobody wants that crap.  Jimmy pretty much doesn't like any other band besides Black Sabbath.  He'll mention a few, but.  I like other bands, dude.  Korn is fantastic. 
[02:02:30]  I'm not just saying he's on the phone.  I mean, I recognize great bands.  I'm not stupid, but.  The only bands he likes are bands that have at some point toured with Ozzy.  Absolutely.  I'll even listen to Queensryche because they opened for Ozzy back then.  Queensryche.  Now we got a problem.  Only Kid Joe and Motorhead.  That was a fantastic Korn.  What an ass you are, man.  So, Jonathan, what can we look forward to as far as the Family Values Tour this year?  It's going to be a lot of fun, man.  We got a lot of great bands on there. 
[02:03:00]  It's with us and a band called Dern Grave.  Crazy, psychotic band from Japan.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because we were announcing a lineup today, and I don't know anything about those guys.  The Japanese band, huh?  Yeah, the Japanese band, they've got a huge underground following over here in the States.  The music's really just, I don't know how to explain it.  It's just really just psychotic.  It's like Atari Teenage Riot metal.  Really?  What's funny is watch the lead singer, he sits there and cracks his face open and rips his chest open with Barry Ann bleeds everywhere. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, man.  It's pretty psycho.  He's about like four foot tall and just doesn't sing.  Does he sing in English or?  No, it's all in Japanese.  I have no idea what the hell they're saying.  Wow.  They barely can speak any English.  Oh, nice.  Oh, my God.  I've got to get there early now.  That's pretty twisted.  Now I'm getting there early to check them out.  Yeah.  They're pretty crazy.  And then you've got Flyleaf after that, and then Stone Sour, and then Deftones. 
[02:04:00]  Deftones always rock.  And then, of course, porn.  Yeah, and I think our fans have been waiting for the Deftones to tour together.  It's been since, I think, it's been since Ozzy, since we came together, I think.  Oh, I didn't remember the Deftones from that, so I just remember you guys.  Now you love the Deftones.  I like them.  I respect that.  Shut up.  That's my favorite thing is talking to bands is just telling me Ozzy stories.  I met Sully.  All I want to do is ask Ozzy questions.  It makes me happy.  Yeah.  Oh, it was Scooby-Doo, Anthony, not superheroes. 
[02:04:30]  The cartoon.  Yeah, it was kind of like Scooby-Doo-ish.  Yeah, but they had some kind of powers.  Yeah, it was their corn powers.  Corn powers, where they would turn into, like, useless vegetables or something.  Exactly.  Popcorn, corncowl.  It was ridiculous.  They'd just kind of fall to the ground and be useless.  Exactly.  It was perfect.  Hey, what do you think of today's music there, Jonathan?  Today's music.  I think it's starting to come around a little bit.  I think that we went through a little dull period there the last five years or so.  We did.  We did.  All these whiny bands talking about their chicks at the mall. 
[02:05:00]  And my girl, like Anthony imitates.  I've got to go out and get me a new girlfriend, because I'm so shut up.  Shut up.  They all sound like that.  I want to smack them.  Bring back the guitars, please.  Yeah, it's getting better.  The whole emo scene is kind of just ugh.  Yeah.  But I'm feeling like it's just turning around.  I think so, too.  I really do.  Are you into the Wolf Mother yet?  Are you into Wolf Mother, or are they too poppy for you? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, no.  Wolf Mother's cool.  Yeah.  I saw them recently in New York, man.  They were unbelievable.  They're blowing up.  Yeah, they're blowing up.  I like that.  It's cool.  It's like old school.  It's kind of me to six, but I don't know.  I like them a lot.  Cool.  All right, Jonathan.  All right, Jonathan.  Sounds like you're tired.  It's early in L.A.  They're telling us you've got to go.  Well, we look forward to the Family Values Tour.  It's Jones Beach, September 2nd, with tickets going on sale tomorrow at 10 a.m.  through Ticketmaster and LiveNation.com. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, get them.  And also, remember, there's $9.99 tickets for the lawn.  Yeah, I mean, it's a cheap ticket.  I like that.  Very cool.  Very cool, you guys.  There's two stages, too.  There's five other bands on another second stage.  So get their $10, $10 bands.  It's not that bad.  All right.  When you're in New York, you've got to stop by and say hi.  We're talking to a huge audience these days.  We'd love to have you play or something, matter of fact.  Just get real crazy in here.  Right on.  We'll hook it up. 
[02:06:30]  We'll have your people talk to our people, and we'll see if we can figure something out.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right, Jonathan.  Always been a fan.  Continued success.  Thanks, homie.  You guys take care.  All right.  It's Jonathan Davis, everyone.  Lead singer of Korn.  And don't forget, we've got 100 pairs of tickets to give away outside the studio today.  I guess we've got to do that now.  I think we just ran out of show.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Did we do anything today?  No.  It's always crap.  We talked about stuff.  That's what we do.  It's three hours of drivel, and then we walk and do another hour and a half of drivel. 
[02:07:00]  100 pairs of tickets to give out outside the studio in moments on 57th and 6th Avenue.  If you want to see the Family Values Tour September 2nd at Jones Beach, get to 57th and 6th right now.  No filter, Paul.  Hey, good morning, guys.  You're having your birthday party at FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village on Long Island, my brother's restaurant, tomorrow night?  Yeah, but it's for me and Big A.  Both our birthdays are this week.  Both our birthdays.  Was it a surprise party?  No, it was just a little discreet thing. 
[02:07:30]  Your brother wanted a small one, but now we're doing karaoke.  Brother.  Are you doing karaoke, too?  Yeah, there's a $50 gift minimum, so if you want to come, come on down.  How old are you going to be?  I'm going to be 35.  35 years young.  How about Big A?  I have no idea.  All right.  35.  I'm going to try to make it there, no filter, Paul.  All right, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow, hopefully.  And it's true that you're buying everyone's dinner, right?  No, I don't know about that.  No, I think Brett's putting a buffet on for everyone.  All right.  Yeah, I guess he's doing something special for you guys.  A buffet. 
[02:08:00]  Happy birthday, no filter, Paul.  Happy birthday.  We'll continue the show on XM Satellite Radio, and during the walk, we just hand out corn  tickets all over the place.  We'll see you downstairs.  If not, have a great weekend.  Emanating from the center of my toilet, I've been sitting here for hours. 
[02:08:30]  Strain, struggle, splash.  My legs have fallen asleep.  What day is it?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  We are outside Free FM in New York City.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at this.  I thought we'd give away like 10 pairs of tickets to see corn September 2nd at Jones Beach,  but I think we're giving all of them away today. 
[02:09:00]  You guys want corn tickets?  Yeah, okay.  That's what it's all about.  How are we even going to walk?  Well, um...  Got a couple of signs, too, by the way.  I think we should give out the tickets at the corner.  At the corner?  Yeah.  So we got all these people that have to walk with us now.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's have these guys walk.  We're walking XM.  We got to get away from the building, then we can give out the corn tickets.  Yeah, sure.  Fancy people. 
[02:09:30]  Fancy gentlemen.  Oh, I'm going to sign something.  Let's sign this lady's thing.  Norton, I want a big, juicy kiss.  I'll sign.  Kiss my cheek, miss.  Oh, uh-oh.  She's getting a kiss.  Uh-oh.  Should I hold it here?  You are shaking like crazy.  Why are you shaking?  Oh, I just stepped on your foot, Kenny.  Jimmy, why didn't you say you love her back?  Because I don't know her enough.  I just didn't love her.  But I just didn't say you were a kind of person.  Thank you.  Jimmy, you don't love her back?  Give her a kiss back, Jimmy. 
[02:10:00]  This is the first time you didn't say yes to a kiss.  Thank you.  What's up, man?  I'll be a dying fire.  We'll sign that later, sir.  Great sign.  There's a sign that says, mind your business, and one that says, Jimmy, help my rascal.  Do a goddamn radio show.  Why is this cutting in and out, this thing?  I don't know.  It'll get better once we get a little closer.  It's a bed bug.  All right, we got lots and lots of people doing the walk today with us.  I'm trying to see the annoyed look on people's faces when I see this big crowd coming at them. 
[02:10:30]  Really unhappy.  Yeah, they're all pissed off, much like they normally are.  Yeah, we get the whole sidewalk today.  That's like a mob scene.  Oh, look at this couple.  What a victim.  What victims they look like.  Enjoy the cinder block over your head, sir, later.  Enjoy putting a cinder block over someone's head later, sir.  Why is that tie around his neck like that?  It's going to look like strange fruits.  Oh, God.  See that guy's T-shirt?  I'm with Shorty.  Stop giving me a flat tire. 
[02:11:00]  You can't walk, though.  We're in the middle of a huge crowd.  All right, what are we going to do?  Should we just throw the corn tickets in the middle of traffic and see what happens?  Yeah, we'll take this big crowd, throw the tickets in the middle of 57th, watch the ensuing riots, get arrested, get fired, have a two-year vacation.  I like it.  I like it, too, Jimmy.  I like the long-range planning there.  All right, we've got to figure out an organized way to do this.  Ben's got the tickets. 
[02:11:30]  So, uh.  All right.  First one.  Tickets?  Yeah, yeah.  Tickets?  Yeah, follow us.  Tickets?  If you want corn tickets, just follow us.  That guy had the worst perm I've ever seen on a guy.  What an awful fucking hairdo.  What's that fucking Brady boy's perm?  He looks like a fat Sam head.  Corner.  All right, here we are at the corner.  Corner.  Get it?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, we're giving away corn tickets on the corner.  On the corner.  Spelled with a K.  It's corner with a K. 
[02:12:00]  We're a morning zoo.  Isn't that fantastic?  Corn tickets on the corner.  It's better than Man Town.  We are completely.  In the order?  This corner now is totally useless.  People cannot cross the street.  Good.  We are annoying people, and I love it.  As a goof, we've got to send these pictures into FMQB.  They will print them.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony gave away corn tickets on the corner.  On the corner.  All right, how are we going to do this?  Where do we even begin?  All right.  Ben.  Congratulations on your 80s. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Happy from Howard.  You guys want corn tickets on the corner?  Here again.  Jimmy's.  Oh, my God.  This will work.  I love this.  Look, they're starting to bump.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Someone's choking Ben again.  Listen, if you get a pair of tickets, back off.  Wait.  We've got to organize this better.  All right.  All right.  How about this?  The first guy to fuck me in the ass.  All right.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  No, we've got to organize this better.  Hey, where are my tickets, Jimmy?  We've got to get a line to the house.  Why are the mics crapping out?  Wait.  People are standing here with their arms through, and they're getting two tickets, like, left  and right.  We've got to organize it so they get one.  If you guys get a pair of tickets, do us a favor and back up.  I love how we do things so ass backwards.  It's so stupid.  We have this huge crowd.  I've handed out ten beers, and it hasn't budged at all.  We're in the middle of it.  Look at Jimmy. 
[02:13:30]  Jimmy's hoarding the tickets.  Get him away.  All the guys squishing eyes.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  I think someone stole my wallet.  Give me one to the...  There you go.  Back up now.  If you've got corn tickets, back up.  We've got to figure out how to...  Oh, my God.  Back up.  This isn't working.  All right.  We've got to back up here.  Oh, my God.  Ben, if you get corn tickets, back up.  I feel like I'm at that Who concert, but it really got trampled.  Dude, I really don't want... 
[02:14:00]  Ow.  I really don't want to feel Jimmy's penis in this way.  Can you hurry up?  We're getting squashed.  I'm being beaten about the head.  We're getting squashed.  Go.  We're getting squashed.  Jesus, Ben.  Hurry up.  Oh, my God.  Stop perking and jerking and give away the corn tickets.  I got you already.  I hit you.  Oh, this sucks.  I already got you.  All right.  Go.  Someone's got their fist up my ass.  Can you give them a pair of tickets, please?  We got more?  All right.  All right.  This way, Ben.  This way.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:14:30]  If you got corn tickets, please back up.  We got the same guy getting five tickets.  If you got more than a pair, come on.  Help us out and give it to a dollar.  Did you get any?  Did you get any?  Give her tickets.  Give this young lady a pair to give the chick.  Hey, Ben, give me a pair to give the chick.  Come on, Ben.  There you go.  All right.  What's that?  Is that it?  Come here.  Come this way.  Is that it?  Wow.  We're on Monday.  All right.  That's it.  That's it.  That's all we got?  I swear to God, that's it.  We gave it 100 pairs? 
[02:15:00]  We just gave away 100 pairs?  That means someone has about 10 in their pocket.  Find him and beat him up.  All right.  We're going to have more tickets on Monday.  What's up?  We've got to organize it better so people get in line and get him and then fuck off.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That was 100 pairs?  No, that was it.  That went really, really fucking fast.  I swear to God, that was 100 pairs of tickets.  That went fast.  All right.  Voice your displeasure in front of the XM building.  We're heading that way now. 
[02:15:30]  Let's see if we can cross the street.  Let's go this way, actually.  Go this way.  Go this way, sweetie.  Okay.  Go this way, I think.  I don't even know where the street...  Okay.  All right.  This way.  This way.  This way.  Making our walk to XM Satellite Radio.  We just gave away 100 pairs of tickets.  That was a fucking mob scene.  Oh, I just checked to see if I still had my wallet.  Thank you.  I saw those dirty hands coming through.  Filthy people.  We've got a lot of fans out here today.  Yes.  We've got to get that video online.  That was a complete mob scene as we were giving away the corn tickets. 
[02:16:00]  I'm sure I have hepatitis now.  Corn tickets on the corner.  A K and a K, Oval.  All right.  We've got to cross the street here.  We've got to get into the building as soon as possible.  These guys are going to kill us.  We do have more corn tickets on Monday.  More on Monday.  We've got to organize the fedder on Monday.  What dopes we are.  Goddamn.  Okay.  Cross the street.  Make sure everybody give a little money to our favorite bum over here, Mac.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to go. 
[02:16:30]  Don't forget.  I've got to give the plug.  The Family Values Tour hits Jones Beach September 2nd with corn, Deftones, and others.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Hey, Mac.  Through Ticketmaster and LiveMation.com.  These guys will hook you up.  There you go.  That's our homeless friend.  Throw some dollars at him.  Give, Mac.  That was like, fuck, Mac.  Give generously.  This is the biggest crowd we've had so far in the walkover.  Yeah.  Believe me.  I was right in the middle of it.  Yeah.  Call to go to Kenny and Mike Cole are losing their minds. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  They're trying to protect us.  Wow.  I was being, like, beaten by elbows in the back of my head with people reaching over  me to try to get tickets.  Like being a soldier in Mogadishu.  I got molested.  Woo!  What's up, bro?  Please, let's bring these people all into the lobby and really annoy the guy.  Sir.  All right.  Yeah.  Make them all have to sign in.  Yeah.  Tell them that the lobby guy has corn tickets.  It's in his colon.  Watch the wall.  I don't think it's smart to stay out here.  No, I think we should go right in.  We have a couple hundred people. 
[02:17:30]  Wait.  Guys, thank you.  We have more corn tickets on Monday.  Have a great weekend.  And there they go.  Hi.  Holy crap.  Love to organize that.  Don't worry.  They're okay.  They're fine.  Get the video.  Don't hurt your daughter.  Get the video up online immediately.  That was nuts.  Did you expect that many people?  There was about a hundred that were outside, and then as soon as we started the walk, they  came from everywhere.  There were hundreds of people out there. 
[02:18:00]  Three.  Yep.  All right.  All right.  Opie and Dopey.  Opie.  Two guys that hate each other.  Just shut your mouth.  I hate them.  Shut up.  Don't be untimed.  Shut up, bitch.  Oh, very nice.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  Opie.  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck. 
[02:18:30]  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter, and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  E-Rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve. 
[02:19:00]  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Did everyone get upstairs safely?  I hope so.  Wow.  That was nuts.  Wow.  Wow.  We didn't pre-promote that at all. 
[02:19:30]  This morning on our CBS show or whatever.  I don't even know how to explain this anymore.  The show that is heard on XM and the CBS stations.  We just started saying, hey, show up outside the building at 9 o'clock.  We'll give you corn tickets.  It wasn't like us promoting this for weeks and weeks.  No.  We did three or four mentions.  Maybe five total mentions all morning.  And there are hundreds of people out there.  Hundreds.  Club Soda Kenny was taxed.  Out of nowhere.  You were taxed today. 
[02:20:00]  That was bad.  We're not doing that no more.  We'll have to do it better.  We'll do it again Monday.  Wasn't that a perfect example of how not to do something?  Stay on the corner in a circle and just give the same hand would come through and try  to grab tickets twice.  We've got to do a line next time.  Yep.  So it only like one.  And then you give one person and say, scram.  Beat it.  Hit the bricks.  Get out of here before I throw you out.  I like the craziness of it.  We got video.  We'll throw it up on opiananthony.com.  It was a complete mob scene. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, that was wow.  Corn tickets on the corner.  Wretched bedbugs.  Corn.  Corner.  Is it smoothies?  No smoothies.  I want my blueberries.  Smoothie, please.  I like blueberries.  I don't have enough.  Look at the voice I'm working on.  I don't have enough blueberries.  That's a good one.  I like blueberries.  That's not too annoying at all.  Do they have blueberries in the smoothies?  No, no.  They got mango, pineapple, strawberry.  Well, how about some fucking strawberry pineapple?  All right.  Here's a buck. 
[02:21:00]  And I'll have my normal, you know what I like, Kenny.  That's right.  A load on a cracker.  And you just, yeah, jack a little into it.  I'd like some strawberry pineapple.  Love fat.  Oh, my God.  I want to punch you today.  Why do you want to punch me?  Oh, I don't know.  Ah, there was a lot of corn fans.  I'm the corn.  Er.  That was crazy.  It certainly was.  It was a lot of fun, though.  Wow.  Ask me what kind of smoothie I'm getting. 
[02:21:30]  What kind of smoothie?  Strawberry pineapple.  You're such an ass.  All right.  Where was I?  Oh, nice banana.  I got to remember who I had popped up here and who I didn't.  Thank you, sir.  Strawberry.  No, not strawberry.  Strawberry pineapple.  The pit crew is coming in so we could continue with the show.  The shit crew?  Larry Brown was fired here in New York. 
[02:22:00]  Who cares?  The Knicks stink.  They're going to stink for another decade.  Is that basketball you speak of?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a huge story.  It's on the front page of all the papers here.  Oh, I know.  Adam Sandler, click.  Two and a half stars, one and a half stars in our papers.  Another bad movie from Adam Sandler.  It looks awful.  When does Hollywood finally give up on him?  But he clicks and everything stops.  I would like to have one of those.  Everyone will go see it.  I would click and everything would stop.  Who is that on the fucking camera? 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  What?  Oh, my orange just answered the phone.  You don't like her, though.  You've said it so many times you don't like her.  I like her.  Dude, my orange just answered a phone call.  Opie, your orange is not a phone call answerable.  If that was true, my strawberry pineapple smoothie would be answering the phones.  All right.  Where's the, uh, we got some great audio. 
[02:23:00]  We got some great audio of a husband-wife radio team that worked together.  Yeah, it was a story on the news about working together.  We're getting that?  As a couple.  We're getting that?  What a friggin' nightmare that would be, having your wife working beside you in any capacity.  A nagging wife.  All right, by the way, we can start with this.  We talked about it.  It's all the rage.  Fights on the internet?  Yep.  Bum fights, felony fights.  Chick fights. 
[02:23:30]  Chick fights are always the best.  So, basically, people are, you know, taping the fights that go on in the backyards and the schoolyards and all that.  The schoolyards.  And we were talking about it earlier.  Here's the news story.  Because we saw the video on TV.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  We saw it on the TV.  What happened?  The rise of the Fight Club.  Websites that show some very nasty fights for money.  Even if your children aren't duking it out, they could still be feeling the blows.  Here's NBC's Kevin Tibbles.  There was a time when kids would gather around to watch a schoolyard brawl. 
[02:24:00]  These days, with the internet, the whole world is watching.  I'm pretty sure there's some people out there that get the, you know, get excited off of watching that.  They sit down and they actually go and search through and look for the best fights.  For brothers Blake and Boone Cater, childhood roughhousing grew into organized fights that they taped and posted on the web for their friends to watch.  Go out there to have fun.  You get that adrenaline rush going.  That rush may explain the popularity of similar webcasts. 
[02:24:30]  An explosion of amateur fistfights at your fingertips.  This video, called White Trash Chick Fight, has been viewed nearly three million times.  But some psychologists worry that now the fight is three million times.  Three million times.  The name alone makes it a hit.  Hell yeah.  Please tell me they're not going to be able to stop this stuff.  No, they won't.  White Trash Chick Fight.  If something's being checked out three million times, you've got to allow it to happen.  If they cannot stop beheadings and ogre, they're not going to be able to stop this nonsense.  I hope. 
[02:25:00]  Because everyone wants to be a star, so they're getting their videos online like crazy.  Like crazy.  Whatever it takes.  Three million people checked out that one fight that they showed on TV today.  Yeah.  And then TV showed it, so now more people are going to check it out.  Exactly.  When I first heard of it a few months ago, I knew exactly where to go because they said  a popular search engine's video section.  It's like, oh, Google video?  Okay.  Let me go there.  Chick Fights.  Boom.  There it is. 
[02:25:30]  Thanks for the advertising.  They make these things popular.  Not many people know, but a lot of people do if there's that many downloads.  But when the news mentions it, boof, a load of them.  What is all this?  It's a Jeter thing.  Oh.  I can't wait to go meet Derek.  Hey.  That's it.  Thanks, Big Kev.  Oh, Big Kev.  Thank you, asshole.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  One fucking dump all goddamn day long.  One fucking dump.  And who is it? 
[02:26:00]  We go through.  We are professionals.  Our goal is to go through our broadcast day putting on an entertaining show on broadcast  radio and not have any dumps.  For the whole family.  Exactly.  A show for the whole family.  The whole ding-dong fucking family.  Pa, kids, grandma, grandpa.  Right.  And we almost did it.  The other day.  It was yesterday.  Save for one.  Yesterday we had one dump and it was a caller.  It was a caller.  And today we had one dump. 
[02:26:30]  And it was a punk.  Big Kev.  Big potty mouth.  In the background, off mic.  But Al Dukes with his sharp hearing.  He has ears like a bat that dukes.  Oh, yes.  That dukes.  And a head to match.  That's right.  Ears like a bat, cock like a mealworm.  That dukes gets it done.  That's 7.23.  Sorry.  Not even worth the time.  Bullshit.  Big Kev. 
[02:27:00]  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, Kev.  Maybe you'd like to do something to just wreck this one, too.  Look at all the people it goes to.  Really, we love.  CC'd, too.  We love when you come by, thanks.  Yeah.  Just go ahead.  Curse our show.  Why don't you curse on the storm over here now?  Do you curse on your little podcast?  Oh, good question.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  I know.  Heard it.  Potty mouth.  A podcast.  All right.  Here's the...  I have a rod.  The second clip.  We all have a lot of adrenaline.  That was a crazy scene out there. 
[02:27:30]  But I have a rod.  From what was going on outside?  No.  From that fat chick that kissed you and said she loved you and you wouldn't say, I love  you back?  To pal talk?  Well, no.  Pal talk segued me into a line of thought.  Ah.  What are you thinking of?  Maybe a massage?  Oh, Hawk.  You setting that up?  No, don't do that.  That's kind of creepy.  Look.  Oh, God. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, Jesus.  It...  I can't even see it.  Do you take...  Put that down.  Do you take Cialis in the morning instead of vitamins?  Sounds pretty impressive there, by the way.  It's like coming out of your pocket.  The zippers are done.  I'm trying to talk.  What's the problem?  Let's do a radio show.  Quit goofing around, guys.  Let's get it done.  Oh, shit.  I'm trying to talk here.  What is wrong with you? 
[02:28:30]  I feel good.  Oh, Jesus.  Here's the second clip.  Online fights.  But some psychologists worry that now the fighting has essentially left the rules of the ring behind.  It becomes even more extreme, and the violence, even more accessible to millions of video voyeurs.  In the past, we were viewing it.  Now we're participating in it.  And that makes it much more serious for our young people's safety.  Welcome to Fight Club.  The cult popularity of films like Fight Club has now morphed into homemade fight sites. 
[02:29:00]  Nothing's really happened in any of the fights to me.  Bumps, bruises, you know, just hurting in the morning.  That's about it.  I think that people, you know, might look at it and think it's cool, and then they go out there and try to imitate it and get it hurt.  And that's the concern.  Copycats might get hurt.  When we as a society are encouraging our most vulnerable citizens to become more at risk for behaviors that can jeopardize their life. 
[02:29:30]  As for Blake and Boone, of the hundreds who have seen the punches land on their website, there are at least two who won't watch it.  The only person that really, like, despises it is our parents.  Let this happen.  We're going back to the Roman Empire.  The reality is most people's lives are useless, so let them do this to entertain us.  We need to be entertained on cue.  I like that. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, seriously, that's the deal.  Most people's lives are completely useless, so let them entertain us.  The Internet is really the modern equivalent of the Coliseum.  Weekly dump chart for the week.  Keep track to see who the biggest potty mouth is.  Who is the biggest potty mouth this week?  Was it Big Kev?  I used to curse a lot, and then I listened to Anthony.  Oh, you don't agree with that?  Why not just yell bullshit?  Yeah, or why not just yell something inappropriate for here, like, 
[02:30:30]  Oh, butterscotch!  I'm trying to be, uh...  Oh, napkins!  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  Attaboy!  Oh!  Hey!  Oh, potty mouth.  This whole family's potty mouth.  So here's the weekly dump chart we can track of all the dumps for the week.  I used to be the leader, but I listened to Anthony.  I gotta be a more responsible broadcaster, because there's some bigwigs that get the email.  They get CC'd.  And lawyers and stuff, so...  But that said, I had one dump this week. 
[02:31:00]  One dump.  Very proud.  Very proud.  Anthony had one dump this week.  One dump.  Which one was it?  It was a questionable one, too, or something.  Yeah, it was really questionable on content.  It was just...  It wasn't a curse or anything.  All right.  It was, uh...  Oh!  It was the Rambo.  The Rambo?  Not Rocky.  The Cox.  The Cox.  The Black Cox.  The White Cox.  That was me.  I don't remember seeing me getting dumped on that.  I had, too.  I think I skated on the Rocky a bit.  I'll be right back. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Thank you, Than.  I think I had either one or two in that bit.  My dumps...  I'm not saying I'm sure, but...  My dumps...  None of my dumps were cursing.  It was like, was one of them a slip?  No?  I don't know.  You're not allowed to say jizz anymore.  We also got to keep track...  Yeah, we heard about that.  Jizz bag, jizz bucket.  We also got to keep track of all the words that are taken away from us on commercial radio.  The obvious ones, they took away from us because you just can't do it.  Shit, piss, fucker, cocky, fucker, motherfucker, too.  And now there's words...  Niggers they took away.  Niggas.  Yeah.  Niggas.  Jizz bag.  All versions of the N-word, and now all versions of the jizz word. 
[02:32:00]  Jizz.  Jizz bag is a great word.  Jizz bag.  Jizz bucket.  Jizz bucket is the best.  Jizz.  Jizz in any form.  But can we keep track of that somewhere, too?  Yeah.  The words that are taken away from us slowly but surely over there?  See, we invent new ones.  Why would they allow us to say jizz when things are going so well?  Jizz.  Too close to jizz-um?  Yeah, jizz is a rough one.  I think lawyers are incapable of enjoying things when they're going well.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's Norton and Anthony.  White cocks, black cocks.  Norton and Anthony during impression of a rocky fire. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, I think I said white cocks.  And, of course, Jimmy said black cocks.  And Jimmy loves the black cocks.  No.  Because he's a size queen.  I am not a size queen.  It's personality that matters.  That is such an awful, like, expression.  Size queen.  He just likes them big.  I'm just going to have a tattoo on my arm.  He says size queen and never explain it.  Size queen.  What does that mean?  All right, here we go.  So Opie, one dump.  Anthony, one dump. 
[02:33:00]  Rich Voss with a stupid hemorrhoid.  Fingers up the ass.  Crap from yesterday.  One dump.  Trying to be clever.  Big Kev.  Yeah, I know.  Bullshit.  Jimmy.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Jimmy had three dumps this week.  Wow.  None of them were really bad.  No, not curse words.  No, that was just questionable.  By the way, this is very accurate as far as the other definition of dump.  I've had one dump this week.  One dump the whole week.  Are you really that backed up?  I don't know what the hell is going on.  You don't drink enough water? 
[02:33:30]  I drink a lot of water.  Why aren't you making duty?  Now I'm trying to flip his seed.  Yeah, I saw you.  Oh, God.  This morning, I wrecked my cereal with a big heaping spoonful of flax seed.  This morning, he's making his cereal, and then he opens up this flax seed and goes,  What the hell am I doing?  What has my life become?  As he's sprinkling flax seed on my blueberries.  Ew.  And yesterday, you're going, yeah.  They look at me and go, hey, who's this college kid? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, you mean the one with the fucking Metamucil and his fanny pack?  Flax seed.  So, I'm trying to flax seed to get more dumps.  This is everything, huh?  Yep.  Things to dump.  What is this?  It's like pages and pages.  It's three entire full single-spaced pages of words just right next to each other.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  So, the weekly dump chart, the winner this week, the callers with five dumps. 
[02:34:30]  Can we do something?  And then, these are things to dump out of when we're on regular radio.  Can we start the Benny Hill music and see if Anthony can get through this really fast?  Okay.  You ready for the challenge, Ant?  Yeah, we'll give it a try.  Thanks.  All right.  We're looking for the Benny Hill music.  Fuck.  Cock.  Cunt.  Look at that.  Fuck.  Cunt.  Cock.

Poopers, vaginas, rectums, asses.  Accept non-sexual expressions such as shove it up your ass.  Sticking objects inside someone were clearly sexual.  Raped with a stick, bat, or other item.

Graphic descriptions of sexual or excretory organs or activities or product.  Dwelling, repetition of, and persistent focus on sexual or excretory activity.  Presented in a pandering or titillating manner or for shock value. 
[02:37:30]  Language or sound effects which describe or simulate sexual acts.  Comments and jokes by the on-air personalities cannot be characterized as educational, clinical, or instructional.  The only purpose of the jokes and comments appear to have been to pander and titillate.  Less explicit material and material that relies principally on innuendo to convey a sexual or excretory meaning  have also been cited by the FCC as actionable, indecent, wherever the sexual or excretory meaning was unmistakable.  Material was found to be actionable, indecent, despite attempts to obscure, objectible language. 
[02:38:00]  Because editing was ineffective and merely resulted in a beep in the middle of clearly recognizable words.  Because the words were recognizable.  Notwithstanding the editing, they were indecent within the context used in the broadcast.  Although fleeting, the language clearly referred to sexual activity with a child.  It was found to be patently offensive.  There it is, folks.  Now you all know the rules.  You all know how to abide by them during the FM show.  So when you make a phone call, use those rules that you just heard.  Remember, it's the baby cunt and ass eater show.

You guys just go on.  The part where you hang up on me is awesome.  All right, let's take a break.  We got Donna Mike audio.

And we gotta get the audio.  Hopefully they're working on it right now.  They interviewed this couple that do a radio show together.  Yeah, husband and wife team.  It must be rough, you know, living together and then having to go to work.  And punch her in the face.  Mmm. 
[02:40:00]  Mmm.  That is a good banana-y smoothie.  I like more banana than strawberry.  I have, um, um, strawberry pineapple smoothie.  Stop.  That's it, bed bug.  Can we take a break?  I told you to leave that alone.  It's a very important work of art.  Naughty, naughty, you filthy old sumka.

Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  We haven't talked about it yet, 
[02:41:30]  It's about the prosthetic legs. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, what a tragic story.  We've got to get that story.  This has all the features, this story.  It sure does.  Of tragedy.  What happened to Jimmy?  Did he get pissed off about something?  No.  He probably had to take a piss.  Ah, ah.  Or something.  I don't see him out there.  Sometimes he does just leave to make a phone call.  Yeah.  That's our Jimmy.  But this time it could be to take a piss.  Yikes. 
[02:42:30]  Tuning, that might help. 
[02:43:00]  I'm going to hear when it kicks in.  Who is it? 
[02:43:30]  It's a high school band.  From Tarrytown, New York.  What happened to the band? 
[02:44:00]  This band thought the performance was solid enough to be posted online.  Wow.  At the end, they get an applause break, by the way.  Are you done with this, John?  Yeah.  Well, the guitar solo especially stinks.  They don't have enough instruments.  Is that what happens?  Can't hear it.  Because it's only one guitar and a drummer. 
[02:44:30]  Is the guitarist singing?  Is it just a singer?  Guitar and drum.  How old would you say these kids are?  Twelve?  And he came in a little too soon.  He came in a little too soon.  He was so fast.  Why does the guitar just stop there? 
[02:45:00]  He doesn't know that part?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This roll.  Oh, my God. 
[02:45:30]  Wow, is that bad.  All right.  Are we done now?  Yeah, now we're done.  We might have to hear the big finish.

Listen, in high school, another kid did a cover for Radiohead's Creep, and it's fucking  awful.

[02:59:30]  do five plus hours of radio a day give us a break will you well you are in my house married radio  team on the today show this first clip describes uh their their little uh you know their little  thing as an affair without the sex oh that's pretty cool isn't that cute all the tuntiness without  the load this is so much better than talking about opie and anthony and all that controversy they uh  caused well for better or for worse a lot of men and women are forging these marriage-like 
[03:00:00]  relationships in the workplace and you can find them just about anywhere from the halls of say  morning television to the executive suite to right here in chicago on the radio report  workers oh i see what they're they're doing a story on uh yeah we're guys and go to work and they kind  of have this uh relationship with some chick at the office but there's no sex but they have an ongoing  relationship they flirt with each other and this right okay maybe do a little lunch or do a coffee 
[03:00:30]  break together because they work together they work together so and they spend uh just as much time  with that person as they do with their significant other so they build up this relationship that is  almost like a marriage some of these have been going on for 20 years 30 years or 12 years like  ah like you and i right i haven't an affair without the sex right here in front of your eyes well  because one of us doesn't want to and they said like it's like uh i forgot my thought oh

[03:21:30]  six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight according to eric and kathy they're just blowing  up there in chicago yeah faces are everywhere number one but except for each other's crotch  that's right because they're not married certainly on the back end of horses  number one it's it's in no particular order here i don't like the way that outfit looks on you  anymore every woman has a go-to get up if you don't know it you don't know her well enough to 
[03:22:00]  discuss her flabby stomach the only thing that could ever change the way an outfit looks is the  way it fits tell her you aren't sure why it looks odd suggest a looser knit and watch her forever skip  the nachos with cheese nachos with cheese suggest a looser if you suggest something looser for your wife or  chick she's gonna be like what she's just gonna say okay and not ask why am i fat right and then  you got the fat argument what's the suggestion again what's like the the way they wear the first 
[03:22:30]  way they wear it uh if you don't every woman has to go to get up no no no what's that i don't like  the way that outfit looks on you anymore number two how about phrasing it differently like you know  when you'd wear that i used to want to fuck you now i just want to yell pig and cut your throat  what does he mean six ways to tell your girl to lose some weight uh here's another suggestion  all right i can't get over how fat i feel women have been commiserating with each other for enos
