<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in crude and sexually suggestive banter, immediately establishing the show's vulgar tone.  They then mocked the media's overreaction to a hurricane threatening the Republican National Convention.  The conversation shifted to Lance Armstrong's cycling ban, prompting humorous speculation about the restrictions. Anthony shared frustrations with negative Twitter interactions, detailing a critical DM.  A significant portion of the show focused on a dispute with management over their accrued vacation days. E-Rock's flawed calculations revealed they might actually *owe* the company vacation time.

The hosts then discussed Bubba the Love Sponge and Jay Moore, with Anthony revealing a text exchange ending in a curt "yuck."  They explored the possibility of a collaborative radio network, contrasting it with working with Howard Stern.  Anthony detailed a trip to Randall's Island, including a walk with a woman and a visit to a Spanish Harlem restaurant, observing the salsa dancing scene.  A caller clarified that a facility they passed wasn't a "gay center," as they'd initially assumed.  The show mentioned an upcoming guest, Joe DeRosa, and discussed a Mike Francesa rant about the Mets.

The show continued with more audio of Mike Francesa's furious rant about the Mets' losing streak.  They also covered the controversy surrounding the UFC 151 cancellation, playing audio clips of Dana White and Chael Sonnen. Anthony announced the reunion of his band, Rotgut.  Further frustration with E-Rock's inability to accurately calculate their vacation time ensued.  A call from producer Kenny, accidentally dialing in during the broadcast, led to a humorous conversation about Kenny's masturbation habits, and further discussion of Francesa and the UFC situation.  A fictional barbershop scene was presented as a comedic bit.

A rambling conversation followed, marked by vulgarity and offensive language.  The hosts discussed personal struggles with tying ties and shoes, malfunctioning boot zippers, and the controversy surrounding the identity of the Navy SEAL who killed Bin Laden (with wildly inappropriate and offensive speculation). They mocked Big Ang from *Mob Wives* using highly offensive language, and briefly discussed *Honey Boo Boo*.  A significant portion was dedicated to impersonating and making crude jokes about Dr. Andrew Dice Clay, incorporating offensive language and an anecdote about his ex-wife.  Joe DeRosa joined the show, sharing anecdotes about his dating life and relationship experiences, including infidelity.  Roland was mentioned as assisting with audio-visual elements.

A phone call with Kevin Smith followed. Smith discussed a *Clerks* screening in Central Park, his experience at Star Wars Celebration 6 (including an emotional Q&A recalling a deceased friend), and the live orchestra performance of the Star Wars score.  He discussed *The Dark Knight Rises*, defending Bane's dialogue and analyzing Bane's death scene and Catwoman's role. Smith promoted his book signing and an appearance on *Comic Book Men*. The conversation touched upon animation styles, a report of an Empire State Building shooting, Dee Snider's anger at Paul Ryan for using "We're Not Gonna Take It" in his campaign, and a physical altercation between a producer (Troy Kwan was mentioned) and someone else.  The hosts also shared their opinions on Woody Allen and Adam Sandler movies.

The final segment started with a discussion about IMAX vs. standard movie screenings and illegal downloads, quickly shifting to D. Schneider's Stanley Steamer commercials, mocking Schneider's appearance and comparing it to John Wayne Gacy's clown makeup. The conversation was interrupted by a breaking news report on the Empire State Building shooting, detailing the chaos, casualties (including a woman shot in the hip and security guards), and the shooter's death. The shooter was described as a recently fired white male. The hosts speculated on the motive and Mayor Bloomberg's stance on gun control. A reporter updated them on the building reopening.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What or before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stung.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fuck the pizza game?  With Opie, the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rag down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Friday morning.  Hola.  Hola.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Ho, ho, ho.  That's good.  I like a good Friday. 
[00:02:00]  I like a pleasant Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Republican National Convention.  Yes.  This is very quick.  The RNC.  The news has got to stop.  Yeah.  We tell it like it is on this show.  Oh, my God.  Because no one else will.  They got to stop.  It's only going to be a little rain.  Will you stop?  Stop with your bullshit fear crap.  This could affect the Republican Convention.  At the worst, they're going to get some heavy rain. 
[00:02:30]  That's it.  Shut up.  Unless they're outside.  I don't think there's a problem.  Of course not.  This hurricane, hurricane.  It's not even going to be a hurricane.  Well, it's bumming them out because they're like, well, most likely it's not going to be  a hurricane by the time it hits the coast of Florida.  But you never know when it hits the Gulf what could happen.  Shut up.  It's not going to be a hurricane that hits the Republican National Convention.  Those Gulf waters are 238 degrees, and it really can power this hurricane line. 
[00:03:00]  So there's your first lie of the day that the news will keep pushing forward.  A lot of shite.  The entire weekend, you're going to hear how this hurricane could affect the Republican  National Convention.  I also heard this one, that if the hurricane goes in, or whatever it is, because it's not  a hurricane, goes into the Gulf, they do tend to gain a lot of strength, much like Katrina.  They have to mention Katrina.  And then they're like, and today is the 20th anniversary of Andrews, so you never know  what could happen. 
[00:03:30]  That was a completely different situation, you idiots.  Oh my God.  I'm just pissed that I didn't go to the Outer Banks this summer, because obviously that  area is going to be fine.  You know what?  I was two for two down there with hurricanes.  I choose to take a year off, and guess what?  And there was no hurricanes.  Hurricane free.  No hurricanes.  Hurricane fucking free.  I went down there this year.  Outer Banks?  Beautiful.  Beautiful weather.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When did you go?  Have you ever been?  No, that was my first time down there.  How great is it down there?  It's pretty cool.  It reminded me a lot of, kind of like Montauk. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Except with way more traffic.  Oh, really?  Oh, where were you?  You got to go to the 4x4 beach.  Yeah, I don't know where we were.  Fuck that traffic shit.  You can avoid that.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure we were in like regular Peopleville.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which is still cool.  Yeah, regular Peopleville.  I'm sure me and Oprah are going to the same places.  I don't know.  Maybe.  You never know.  How was the water?  Is the water warm there or is it like...  Really warm.  Yeah?  When I was there...  So when he said Montauk, I wanted to help him out.  Wow.  Really?  The water's really warm.  It's nice. 
[00:04:30]  I mean, we had a place, I mean, we, I mean, it was like 18 people there.  It was pretty close to the beach and I was just like, oh, you know what?  I don't need flip-flops.  I could just walk there.  No.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Burning?  Dude, there was one point...  I think when he'd get out there and realize, oh, no.  Dude, I was halfway there and I was like, oh, this is a problem.  And I had to stand on a boogie board for a while and figure it out.  Just like you're stranded.  Yeah.  You ever burn your feet so bad they blister and the whole layer of skin comes off?  I never did it that bad. 
[00:05:00]  What happened to me once?  Close, but never that bad.  What the fuck was it?  It was like a boardwalk that they had the right material.  They had old school material.  Oh, wow.  You know those boardwalks now?  You look at it, it looks like wood that could get really hot, but then you step on it like,  whoa.  Yeah, yeah.  Not this time.  I remember going to like a water park, like action park, and everybody's like, oh, like  some of my family had never been.  So like, what do we do with our shoes?  I'm like, fuck it, leave in the car.  I just don't care.  Oh, man.  Because I was used to that, and they weren't.  Like, fucking pavement and walking on hot tar all day long. 
[00:05:30]  Nothing better than when you're in a big parking lot and you've got to run from car shadow to  car shadow to get where you want to go.  And look out for glass the entire time as well.  Yeah, of course.  The darkness.  I like the Outer Banks a lot.  I chose to blow it off this year because, you know, two for two with the hurricanes, like,  look, let's just take a fucking break.  And of course there's going to be no hurricanes.  And this is the two weeks we usually go.  All nice, right?  I think so.  I think it's going to be fine.  But as far as this dumb hurricane, see, it's not a hurricane. 
[00:06:00]  No.  I think it's a tropical storm, right?  Yeah.  It's like nothing right now.  And see what we do?  Yeah.  See this hurricane?  Well, then we get a little confused.  Like, it's a hurricane now.  We're fully aware and it still gets into our brains.  Hurricanes, Alice.  Hurricanes!  Because they want you to watch longer.  They do.  They want you to linger longer.  They love scary news.  If they were the ones to tell you that it was just going to be a little heavy rain, guess  what?  You're not watching as much.  Right.  These fucking bastards.  Yeah, because why does anyone else in the country care if Florida gets rain? 
[00:06:30]  But if Florida gets a hurricane, oh, now you're talking.  Well, it's a hurricane in Florida and then it's the National Convention.  There's a nice combination there.  A little story for you right there.  Right.  But no.  No.  Sorry.  So that's the first thing I want to say.  Yeah.  The second thing, Lance Armstrong has been stripped of pretty much his entire life.  And a testicle.  He's not allowed.  This guy's got the...  And a testicle.  They got the...  Yeah, they took a testicle.  Leave this guy alone.  I know, right?  I guess they've banned him so badly, he's not even allowed to basically sit on a bike ever 
[00:07:00]  again.  He can't.  See, he's not allowed.  Here's what they said.  If anyone sees him riding a bike, even to the store, you can literally have him arrested.  So there's a red alert with all the bike rental guys?  Yes.  Because you could be in trouble if you rent Lance Armstrong a bike.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  That's how bad the band is.  You know what you're allowed to do if you see him on a bike?  Huh?  You could take a stick and throw it into his front spokes and watch him fly over the handle.  Make sure you call the authorities.  Yes.  Call the authorities. 
[00:07:30]  Even if he rents one of those two-seaters.  Yeah.  He's not allowed to do it.  He can't have a romantic fucking...  He's not even allowed on a big wheel.  That's right.  That's right here.  Not even a big wheel.  Not allowed on those three-wheelers.  Nothing.  Where you have the passenger seat in the back.  How about that bike with a giant front wheel and the tiny little, little wheel?  Not allowed.  Is he allowed on that?  Nope.  Not allowed.  He's fucked.  Even one of those weird bikes where you spin around as the bike's going forward?  Yeah.  No.  Not allowed.  How about a unicycle?  Hmm.  He's got a uni-nut. 
[00:08:00]  How about a unicycle?  I think it would be hilarious for him to try to ride a unicycle with one nut.  What if he's on a...  Throw off your balance?  Yes.  Don't your nuts kind of keep you balanced sometimes?  Yeah.  All off.  Actually, he might actually do better on that because I remember trying to ride that thing  and it just crushed him up there real good.  Crushed your balls.  Oh, it hurt.  The unicycle is the dumbest invention ever.  I wonder if he could...  That's stupid.  He could probably win the Tour de France on a unicycle.  Not an unicycle.  Do they let him on a tandem bike as long as he doesn't pedal? 
[00:08:30]  No tandem bikes.  That's what I was saying.  Those are the two-seaters, right?  Yeah.  No tricycle, no nothing.  But here's the news on Lance Armstrong.  Armstrong, he has never failed the drug test, but he's accepting the lifetime ban and it's  basic.  They got something and they're about to go public with it.  They said, hey, pst, Lance.  Here's the deal.  You could either tap out or we're going public with what we know.  Yeah.  That's what that's about.  How about those giant tricycles with the basket that the crazy people ride around town 
[00:09:00]  and put garbage in?  You know those giant tricycles with a big flag on the back or something?  Anything with two wheels.  Damn it.  He's banned from.  Danny sounds like he's hungover.  What?  Me?  I don't know.  I just...  No, he's not.  He sounds completely the same.  These people that...  Getting over a cold.  These people that have to listen and just fucking try to pick up on just the dumbest, stupidest  things.  Geez, Louise.  Just relax and listen, please.  People are dummies.  Just relax. 
[00:09:30]  I know we're interactive, but relax a little bit.  I don't even...  I have my Twitter battles at night, but I'm not even...  I don't go at it like I used to.  No, I don't battle.  Because it's just...  It's like, eh.  I don't battle.  People make it very obvious that they don't like me, so then you're out of my life.  Period.  That's it.  That's how it works.  You have every right to say what you want about me, but I have every right to make sure  I don't have to see it.  That's how it works in this world.  I get it.  You don't like me, so we're going to move on from this situation.  Yeah.  We're going to move on from this relationship. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  That's like having exes allowed to just keep pounding you.  Why would you allow that?  Why the fuck would you consent to that?  Why would you allow that?  Get out of my life.  Don't need it anymore.  I read your tweets, and it's like, oh, okay, this guy obviously does not like me.  That's fine.  That's what happens in this world.  Yeah.  But I don't have to fucking read your tweets.  Here's something that happened last night.  Huh?  Uh, I, I, somebody that follows me, I was following them for a while now, you know, 
[00:10:30]  and not even for anything.  Just, just, you know, it's a, sometimes people go, oh, I got like a, I got something to tell  you.  Could you just follow me so I could DM you?  I hate those people.  I know.  But then you're like, you get curious, curious, you're like, all right, I'll do that.  I don't care.  And then they tell you something, whatever.  So then you just kind of blow it off.  It's always a whatever DM, right?  It is a whatever.  It's never that important, but you know, curiosity gets it.  And then I just don't unfollow, you know, whatever.  Uh, and then, uh, I get this DM that's like, starts chastising me for something. 
[00:11:00]  I'll be vague because like, it's my own personal fucking life stuff, but it's like, really?  Like, who, first of all, what business is it of yours?  What the fuck I do?  A follow does not mean, and I instantly unfollowed.  Of course.  I didn't block, but I unfollowed.  I was like, and I left a message like, like, really?  I have to explain anything to you?  Right.  Anything?  Right.  And usually the DMs are the safe zone, but every once in a while you go, I followed an 
[00:11:30]  asshole.  It's like, I followed a fucking asshole.  How the fuck did that happen?  How the fuck did I follow an asshole?  All the people I follow, you know, we'll have DM conversations.  They'll, you know, whatever, whatever they want to talk about.  Yeah.  And it's always nice.  And it's a little back and forth.  And, and it could even be where they disagree with something.  That's fine too.  Oh, that's fine.  But every once in a while, I'm like, oh my God, that guy never liked me.  Why did I follow him?  It was like, so I'm just, I'm fucking, I was flabbergasted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, really? 
[00:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  You're fucking, you're, you're, you're, you're fucking telling, coaching me on my life.  Right.  You're fucking giving me some, some, like almost chastising me.  God, I wish what, I wish I knew what they were talking about.  Oh, it's my, you know, relationship stuff.  It's just my relationship stuff.  Some people, you know, have a problem with Anthony.  Some people have a little problem with me.  Go fuck your mother.  That's what I say.  That's what I say.  It's, it's just so fucking, ugh. 
[00:12:30]  Shut up.  Don't tell me what's good for me.  I think I know more than some Twitter motherfucker that I happen to follow.  God, I'm just going to unfollow everybody.  I, everyone, everyone, yeah, I will, uh, I will follow the next, uh, hundred people  that, um, follow me on Twitter, OP Radio.  Wow.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  And Anthony Cumia, of course.  Oh, yes, yes, wow.  C-U-M-I-A. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, we don't promote our Twitters enough.  No, we don't.  Uh, yeah, mine's Anthony Cumia.  Uh, and I'm right on the, I'm teetering right on the, uh, the brink of, um, a, uh, follower  milestone, I guess.  Let me take a look-see.  Which one?  Let's see where I am.  What milestone?  It's a biggie.  It's a big milestone here.  What?  Um, oh, yeah.  Oh, wow, okay.  Let's do it today.  I'm right there.  Anthony's, uh, 106 away from 100,000 followers.  106 followers away from the big 100,000 follower mark. 
[00:13:30]  All right, you get that today.  You should celebrate with a beer when you get home.  I think I may do that, as a matter of fact.  How about you celebrate with a beer here, as soon as it happens?  I would, uh, I-  Are we allowed to drink here?  Oh, my God, we can barely drink at gigs.  I'm pretty sure-  I'm pretty sure the guys at Shade roll blunts every day.  I'm-  I think you could have a beer.  I've smelled some shit coming through those fucking walls.  That'd be nice.  But I'm no rat.  I'm no fucking rat.  I'm no rat.  I don't think you have- 
[00:14:00]  You just have to have a sense of smell.  No shit.  No shit.  No shit.  Okay, what animal you are.  Yeah, it's, um, they- like, we do those gigs, and even the afternoon drive gigs.  Right.  Like, when we do morning gigs, it's like, by nine o'clock, I might be ready for, like,  a Bloody Mary or something.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, when we did, like, the gigs at, uh, the Hard Rock and shit like that.  Right.  The afternoon gig, I came in, in Chicago, like, fucking three o'clock, we're going on,  I'm ready for a beer, immediately.  Um, and, and you get kind of a look. 
[00:14:30]  And here's what happened, because we had talked about it with the Cleveland thing, how, you know,  we got the stink eye from management.  I remember grabbing a beer, and even though they didn't say anything, some management  types walked up to me, and their eye went, whoosh, to my hand, back to my eyes again.  Like, they looked like, oh, oh, and I could just see it.  It's like, don't worry, I'm not, I'm going to be fine.  See, take a tip from me, because this is what happened.  Take a tip from Poppy.  Because they had a thing with some nice ice cold beers, they had some Coronas in there, 
[00:15:00]  which I kind of like.  I like-  Wonderful.  I like kind of shitty beer.  What a great set of Chicago.  They make believe Corona's a good beer, but it's a shitty beer.  Let's be honest with each other.  All right, look, you're feeling all good about the lime.  Yeah, thus then, why the lime?  Yeah.  But it really is just crappy beer, which I like.  And I grabbed one, and I looked right in their face, and I go, are you all right with this?  Are you going to be okay with this?  Wow, good one.  That's what you do.  And then they have to be okay.  Right.  Don't go passive-aggressive.  Get right in their face.  Like, are you going to be okay with this?  And you put the ball on their court. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a great fucking thing to do.  By the way.  Let them know that you're on to their stupid little ruse.  Look at all the research we have done.  A lot of research.  I got an email from Iraq, and wow.  I demanded that Iraq figure out how many vacation days we have taken in the last year.  Yeah.  We have management fucking nailed.  Totally.  These bastards have been telling me for a while that I only have two vacation days. 
[00:16:00]  And before people have to, like, get it all bent out of shape over this, I might not even take the days that are owed to me.  It's just the principle of it.  I love things for the principle of it.  It's just the principle of it.  I don't even know what I'm going to do with this info.  But these bastards have been telling me for a while that I only had, at the time, five vacation days left for the year.  Yeah.  So I had to send my wife and my two-year-old, and don't feel sorry for me.  I'm just giving you facts, you fucking assholes. 
[00:16:30]  I love to head them off at the pass.  Because they're fucking, fucking, there's a small, and I'll say it, a very small percentage of this audience that are just pricky little fucking assholes.  They've got to get their face in everything.  I'm just giving info.  Don't you?  Don't feel sorry for me.  Trust me.  I have a great life, and I know it.  So I had to send my wife and my two-year-old down to the shore by themselves because I was like, I can't take the whole week.  You're going to have a baby soon.  I've got to save a couple of these days. 
[00:17:00]  So I had to say goodbye to them, and then I met them in mid-vacation.  So I go, and I came back, and I told Steve Blatter, it's just something's not right.  And then I said, fuck that.  I'm going to get E-Rock on the job.  Wow.  Now you got serious.  Yes.  Let me get E-Rock on the case.  Because as much as we beat up E-Rock, he is damn good at some stuff.  E-Rock knows how to, what they say, TCB.  What's TCB?  Take care of business.  Yes.  He is damn good at things. 
[00:17:30]  That's right.  And one of the things he's good at is-  Eating.  Is go.  What?  Oh, E-Rock.  See, I can't be mad at him today.  He's shaking his head in there.  I can't be mad at him today.  E-Rock, I think this is a free zone for you today.  I don't think I'm going after you today.  How do you feel about that?  I appreciate the jester.  We'll see how the show goes.  Jester.  I'm going to try.  The hard deck is at 10,000 feet.  Jester.  Because what's not fair to E-Rock is we just beat the shit out of him and we never tell 
[00:18:00]  the other side of the story.  Of course not.  He does some fine things for this radio show and he's very good at things.  Yeah.  He gives me Bubba, the love sponge updates.  What?  What?  I don't know.  He's obsessed.  Like, I get-  I think for the goof, I'm actually going to, like, reach out to this Bubba guy.  I don't even really know him.  Really?  Yeah, because Jay Moore's been writing me.  He's like, he wants to talk to you.  Jay Moore's? 
[00:18:30]  And then E-Rock gave me a whole- Don't worry, I'll get back to this thing in a second.  We're really good at this shit.  Joe.  We bring it all together by the end of the break.  Can I read your email?  You're super pissed.  Yeah.  He gives me updates on radio guys and stuff.  Bubba and Jay Moore is what this is titled.  Is that the new morning show down at- Where is that?  Bubba said- And is this from a radio show?  Yeah, it's from his terrestrial show.  Okay.  Bubba said Jay has a bunch of friends on radio.  He mentioned Jim Rome and Opie and Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  Bubba said every radio guy wants to be syndicated.  He wants Jay to get Opie and Anthony, Howard, and Bubba to have a meeting.  Jay Moore has to get this done.  Jay Moore, let's get that done.  Jay Moore.  We have never sat down with Howard Stern.  And we never will.  We just don't get along.  I'll have some coffee.  You'd have coffee with Howard Stern?  I'll have some coffee.  I sat down at a poker table next to their poker table.  It was like the two show poker tables. 
[00:19:30]  Did it feel special?  No, but there was some pleasantries traded.  There were some pleasantries.  Well, there's people that work for that show that are very, very nice people.  Yeah.  That'll always agree with.  That's a good point.  What?  Whoop-dee's making.  I would call the show, call their show, to make a good point.  And then hang up.  What?  I would call their show to make a good point.  What, the Bubba and Jay show?  Have a good call.  Oh, Howard's show or Bubba's show. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would call them up.  Oh, okay.  Man Cow, I'm sorry.  Oh, jeez.  I'm still waking up.  I'm sorry.  Bubba said every radio guy wants to be syndicated.  He wants Jay to get Opie and Anthony Howard Stern and Bubba to have a meeting and get together  to form their own radio network.  Oh.  Sounds like the Super Friends.  Yeah, exactly.  Super Friends.  Meanwhile.  And at this point, I don't even know why I have a problem with Bubba.  I think he really started it because he wanted to beat me up or something, and then I'm like,  all right, then beat me up.  What am I going to do about that?  Beat you up?  What is this?  This is cool.  So many people want to beat me up, but they never did. 
[00:20:30]  Beat you up.  Anyway, what I would say to Bubba, wouldn't we just start our own radio network without  the other guys so we get a bigger piece of the pie?  Yeah.  And I don't think Howard has any need or want to bring anyone on board.  He's doing just fine.  And vice versa, by the way.  Yeah.  We don't need him either.  To form their own radio network, he said everything is on the internet.  He thinks Howard and Opie and Anthony will go to the internet.  Bubba thinks the most talented people should get together to create a very talented bunch. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  The talented bunch.  Bubba then ran down his dream lineup.  Oh.  Howard Stern mornings.  Opie and Anthony or Bubba middays.  Uh-oh.  See, because when you're in radio, that midday slot is a little rough.  Yeah.  So he's being careful with that.  Of course.  Because if he says Opie and Anthony middays and him afternoons, we'd be like, go fuck this  We want our afternoons.  Because the fact is, more people will listen in afternoon drive.  Of course. 
[00:21:30]  Bubba then ran down the dream lineup.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony or Bubba middays and the other guy doing afternoons.  Ah.  See?  Yeah.  But he would want afternoon drive.  Of course he would.  Ron and Fez at night with various programs on weekends.  Hmm.  Bubba said he'd like to talk with Opie.  He told Jay to get the bridge built between him and Opie.  Oh.  Jay told the story about the time Bubba visited him.  He said the moment he hangs up, he's going to text Opie, then go to bed.  Oh.  Should I go to the Jay Moore text?  Go to the Jay Moors.  See, this is where I just blow up my spot. 
[00:22:00]  Ah, I thought you were building bridges these days.  What happened?  Are you about to fucking bridge on the river quietest motherfucker?  Do you want me to do this?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Okay.  Oh, I don't know where he wrote.  Oh, okay.  Do you really want me to do this?  Just let her rip.  All right.  So Jay said he would text me.  Jay said he would text me right after the Bubba interview.  This is real inside shit, but maybe people enjoy it. 
[00:22:30]  So I got the text right away.  So Jay's a man of his word.  He writes, I did a phone-in with Bubba.  You're all he talked about.  Please tell Opie I want to make up.  I want to be his friend.  I told him I would pass it along.  Who wants to guess what I wrote back to Jay Moore?  You've known me a long time.  I would say.  You've known me 18 years.  It says.  How long is the text back to Jay?  Very short.  Very good.  Does it start with tell him?  No. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  It's one word.  Oh, oh, one word.  Is it a very short word?  Oh, yeah.  No.  No, because that's committing.  Oh, oh, oh.  Um.  Die.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Is it yuck?  Or ew?  Ew.  Is it?  Will you stop fucking reading my text messages? 
[00:23:30]  How do you do this?  Now it's a new bit.  Ah, ha, he rock.  What do you do?  How do you know what goes on on my phone?  Oh, I've gotten those answers from you, too.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  He now.  In response to, do you want to hang out?  Yeah.  Fucking, when he sends a picture of himself to Opie.  How the fuck do you know what my phone is doing?  This is creepy.  It goes back to, obviously, the ghost program.  Yes, ghost program.  A picture that I thought I lost.  That was with Oprah, my wife, and my mother-in-law. 
[00:24:00]  Ghost program.  And I thought it was lost forever.  And all of a sudden, he hands me the picture.  Yeah.  Because he had my phone once.  And now he knows exactly what I'm writing back to Jay Moore.  And there it is.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Just yuck.  Yuck.  Just yuck.  So you wouldn't want to...  Well, but a smiley face.  Oh, okay.  Smiley face.  Because that's the other side of my personality.  Oh.  Do you think Jay gave that message?  I don't know what a Bubba could do for us.  What could a Bubba do for us? 
[00:24:30]  He already started his own radio thing, right?  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he wants us just to join that?  Well, he better have Bucco...  What is it?  Bucco De Niro?  What was the fucking from the movie?  Bucco Dolores.  Oh, yeah.  Who's got the Bucco Dolores today?  So we go back to Y-Rock.  So that's the Bubba thing.  Because Y-Rock gives me all the radio info.  He sure does.  Wow.  Just fucking...  You are a bevy of radio information there, Y-Rock.  So these guys made me miss my summer vacation or part of my summer vacation by telling me 
[00:25:00]  I only had five days of vacation left between now and October 1st.  This goes back well.  Because now we're getting closer to October 1st.  That's when our contract ends.  That's the only reason October 1st.  And according to Y-Rock's...  Calculations?  Calculations and deep research.  Yes.  We have a lot of vacation days left.  These fuckers are trying to fuck us even more than they usually do.  I don't get this. 
[00:25:30]  How do they think they could get away with this?  According to Y-Rock...  Where am I now?  Okay.  I took 13 days off not counting company holidays.  That's less than three weeks.  That's not counting like Christmas Day and fucking...  No, those are all vacation...  Those are...  Yeah.  Holiday.  We get those.  Yeah, those are company holidays, but around there you do take a couple personal days.  Yeah, let's say you take a Thursday and a Friday because you got that Monday and Tuesday 
[00:26:00]  off for next week.  Yeah, you want to go.  So I took 13 days off.  13.  I'm allowed...  This is where it gets...  I probably will strangle someone today.  This could be our last show because I think I'm going to strangle someone.  Oh, jeez.  For making me blow off part of my summer vacation because they said I didn't have enough days.  Uh, I'm allowed 25.  So you're allowed 25 days?  According to Y-Rock's research, I took 13.  I can't wait to see how Y-Rock fucked this up. 
[00:26:30]  Even if he fucked it up a little bit, there's...  They're saying...  That's a big disparity there.  They're saying I have two days left.  I am now saying I have 12 days left.  Amazing.  So even if you cut the difference, they're fucking us.  Right.  So I'm owed 12 more days.  12 days.  According to Y-Rock's research.  And Anthony's allowed even more.  I'm owed, I think, a solid two weeks.  You're allowed...  I'm allowed 12 more days.  You're allowed 14 more days between now and October 1st, according to Y-Rock's research.  14 days. 
[00:27:00]  And it's pretty evolved.  Look.  He has the company holidays down there.  He has all the days we took off and Y, including your pertussis.  Yeah.  You got days in there that you could, like, argue because you had a doctor's note?  I know.  And these fucking guys, I'll say, Gary tells me he only had five at the time.  Where did they get their fucking information about how many days we get and, you know...  Had it...  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  I think something's wrong with Y-Rock's research. 
[00:27:30]  I'll be honest with you.  Oh, no faith in Y-Rock.  Well, I don't know.  Something doesn't seem right that the, like, the company would say, well, what a surprise.  The company would say one thing and the employees would say another.  We all deal with that, right?  Yeah.  But, I mean, the disparag...  Gee.  The disparagus.  The disparagus.  Yeah.  They're saying I got two days left and I'm...  It looks like I got 12.  Yeah.  That's fucking...  That is too much of a difference. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Something's amiss.  Right.  And we kept the channel live for how many days, Y-Rock?  Oh, I don't even know.  More than we should have.  More than we should have.  More than we should have.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  We, you know, we like splitting it up and if Hope's got to go somewhere or I got to go somewhere,  the other person comes in, does the show.  It's just...  It's better that way.  It's better for the listeners.  Look, we developed a show where the best combo is me, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  We all know that.  But there are days it works without the moving parts. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And we know that too.  And it's better than just throwing on a replay or something like that.  And it's kind of fun for us as individuals too to have a little different room.  Exactly.  So we thought logically that made sense a while ago.  Fucking A.  Fuck N-A.  Oh, this is for just the last year.  So that means they probably fucked us on vacation days last year.  Oh, man.  The year prior.  The first year of the contract.  Oh, man.  Carryover.  So someone's going to get a talking to. 
[00:29:00]  With charts and graphs.  Oh.  Look at this.  Charts, graphs.  I want a pie chart.  I got him this time.  So does E-Rock.  E-Rock loves pie charts.  I get it because...  See, I can't do that.  He's my friend today.  I know.  He's your very good friend today not to be fucked around with.  So thank you, E-Rock, for that.  Yeah.  You're welcome.  Because you're welcome.  You're welcome.  I handled the Bubba thing, all right.  You're a beaten man.  I'll talk. 
[00:29:30]  The smiley face.  Come on.  Smiley face.  I don't think we need him.  He doesn't need us.  We don't need him.  We don't need Howard.  Howard doesn't need him.  No one needs anyone.  Yeah.  In this new world.  We got our own guys.  If we went to the internet and did our own thing, we got plenty of people that we could  develop into relationships and stuff.  I think no one really needs anyone.  Mm-mm.  You're right. 
[00:30:00]  Nah.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  What else is going on?  We had an interesting little afternoon yesterday.  Went to Randall's Island over there.  You know, there's a park over there and everything.  Is there a girl over there?  Why would you go there?  Well, I went with a girl.  We went over there.  Because I actually, I took my little helicopter over there.  The little one.  Randall's Island is really cool.  I actually did a radio show with Brother Weez over there after 9-11. 
[00:30:30]  Isn't that where the fire guys do their thing?  Is it?  Right?  And they have concerts and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have a huge complex.  Complex.  They have a huge compound where the fire guys do their thing.  Their training.  Yeah.  The training.  And it's really impressive.  I got a whole tour of that place.  Pretty cool, huh?  You haven't checked that out?  Pretty cool, huh?  They got like buildings they could, you know, set on fire and all that.  And the mental institutions there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw all that.  Look at how cool that is.  Yeah.  That's a whole building that's built in another building. 
[00:31:00]  It's built like a basic New York City, you know, walk up.  Yeah.  And you could set it on fire.  With fire escapes and shit.  And then you could blow fire through the whole fucking thing.  And the guys train over there.  Pretty cool, man.  And at the time, they were huge fans of the show.  Yeah.  Really a bunch of nice guys over there.  But anyway, Randall's Island.  Yeah.  I just went over there.  Could you explain where Randall's Island is?  Oh, my goodness.  It's right over there by that Triborough Bridge.  It's, yeah, it's between Manhattan and... 
[00:31:30]  Long Island, I guess, right?  Queens, kind of.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of the northern side of Manhattan, northeast.  Right there in the East River.  Right by the, you know, kind of where the Long Island sound dumps into the East River.  It's between Harlem and Astoria.  Yeah, yo.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I went over there and I was zipping the little helicopter around all over.  People thought it was pretty cool.  A lot of people commenting, oh, yeah, cool. 
[00:32:00]  But there is this one area on that island, I must say, that gets a little dodgy.  Really?  Yeah.  No one really lives over there.  Oh, there's something going on.  Oh, is it the homeless, the little shanty towns?  There's a shelter over there.  What do you mean, a shelter?  I don't know.  It's by the...  Because some of these areas near the water, they actually, and they leave it alone, they're  building little shanties.  Really?  Near the riverbeds and stuff.  I know.  There was a lot of people fishing.  What?  People were fishing. 
[00:32:30]  What do you mean it's a little dodgy?  I don't even think they have housing over there.  No, there's some type of shelter thing, and then there's a something gay center.  The name is Gay.  It's like, not a gay center, but the guy's last name was Gay.  Charles Gay.  Charles Gay.  Must be related to Trav.  Yeah, Dr. Gay.  That's...  How do you go through life with that last name?  I don't know.  Especially before the year 2000?  People do.  Where's the gay center?  Right there?  This is Charles Gay Loop.  Yeah.  So I'm going to assume that that is the gay center. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  Yes.  What happens at the gay center?  I don't know.  But says...  I don't know.  But...  But says...  No, I want to learn.  What happens at the gay center?  I don't...  Is it for gay people?  No, no, no, no.  It's not.  It's the guy's name.  It was gay.  But let me tell you something.  Near the gay center, there was this dead end kind of a road, and there's a bunch of homeboys  hanging out in this area.  And we're walking through, and we go down... 
[00:33:30]  We start going down this, like, road, and a couple of the homies go, yo, yo, yo, yo, do  you don't want to go down there?  What?  And I was like, huh?  He goes, yeah, that's...  He goes, that's dead end.  He goes, that's just...  And I saw, and there was some kind of shelter.  It said some kind of something shelter down there.  Where was it?  That's a homeless shelter.  Homeless shelter.  Where?  Right there.  The gay center is a homeless shelter.  Okay.  So where were you?  I was on one of those roads.  See that road?  One of these loopy deals? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, no, but I was right there by the gay center.  Oh.  Oh, so you were...  I walked down the road.  See that big field?  There was football going on in there.  There was a lot of big fields.  Football training.  Danny, up...  Northeast?  Up to the right.  Northeast?  Yeah, yeah.  Right there, that field.  There was football.  I walked down the road to the left of that field.  Right.  No, over, over...  No, no.  No, I got what you're saying.  See the gay center?  Go kind of...  Right there.  North of the gay center.  See that open field?  Yeah, that one.  Okay.  Then the road to the left of that field, right there.  I walked down there and walked around, like, the gay center. 
[00:34:30]  What were you looking for at the gay center?  Just fucking exploring.  Seeing what was going on at the gay center.  But then there was some kind of shelter area where they were like, don't go in there.  And then the homies was like, just looking after you, man.  Just looking after you.  Wow.  What do you think was happening?  I don't know, but I wanted to see.  Yeah, of course you want to see.  Especially when someone says don't.  If I wasn't with, you know, I was with a girl and stuff.  I didn't want her getting raped and shit. 
[00:35:00]  You know, if more than...  Let me see.  If more than, I guess, 14 people attack me and I'm not amazingly good as far as targets go.  So, yeah, yeah.  Probably could have got some really great shit for that.  I probably should have.  I would have considered a trade.  A trade.  The beauty of this radio show, there's someone out there right now listening that knows exactly  what goes on at the gay center.  What goes on at the gay center.  And what is going on with that road where they said don't go down.  And all the homies hang out there. 
[00:35:30]  And they look.  There's some...  There's things shit going on.  Like, if it was...  And it was starting to get, like, dusk.  Maybe it's corporate headquarters, if you know what I mean.  Maybe.  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  That's exactly where we were.  Like, all around that area.  Why would you do this?  Why not?  It was kind of fun exploring.  Oh, that's the football field.  There's the gay center.  Right?  Okay.  Now we're on street view.  I like...  I can't get in there.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  Jump the fucking...  No.  Isn't street view frustrating?  Like, I can't get in there. 
[00:36:00]  Why can't you get in there on street view?  I can't get in there.  They just don't...  They have, like...  All right.  Can't you just hop it this way, though?  Hop it.  Nah.  They have, like...  Hop the fence.  They have, like...  What do you want to say here?  Like, points.  Yeah.  Like, pictures.  Yeah.  But I can't get down in there.  I can't get down into there.  I thought we could do the walk that Anthony did.  Nah.  It was pretty cool, though.  Reynolds Island's all right.  Yeah.  I don't know what else they do there.  A lot of sports shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of fields there that people play soccer.  I imagine they play a lot of flag football. 
[00:36:30]  A lot of soccer.  Over there.  A lot of football training going on.  What about cricket?  I didn't see any cricket.  I didn't see no cricket.  Starting to see a lot more cricket games in and around New York.  I don't know what that's about.  Who the fuck would play cricket?  Reynolds Island looks like one of those fucking...  Like, Sim City.  Yeah.  Like, you gotta plop your industry in one spot.  Because it's got a little bit of everything.  Yeah, yeah.  You need a field.  You need a bridge.  You need some kind of major road.  A power thing.  A fucking industry.  Water treatment.  Psychiatric center.  Yeah, it's the early stages. 
[00:37:00]  It's the early stages.  Early stages of Sim City.  And then you have to put that dumb stadium in, right?  That just have to do it.  You don't even have enough people for it.  It's like, fuck it.  I want it there.  Looks cool, man.  Look at my stadium.  Way too cool.  I'm gonna play right here.  You place it and then everybody cheers.  I miss Sim City.  Dude, it was a great game.  Was it still happening?  Well, they keep coming out with new stuff.  They do.  You can still play it.  It's still fun.  You're not gonna play it as long as you used to.  But it's cool for a little...  Dude, ah, man.  I like Tropico even better, though. 
[00:37:30]  Tropico was good.  El Presidente.  Did Tropico go away?  They are starving.  Yeah, that kind of took us high.  Because that was fun, man.  Some of the Sim City shit, though, is still pretty cool.  When you really get it built up big and everything just starts failing on you.  Like, oh, my power plant's ready to explode.  Or just some random fire or disaster.  And then all of a sudden you gotta take out, like, two Arcos.  And you're like, fuck, that's like a quarter of a million people.  Yeah.  Fuck.  It was very stressful because you would figure it all out. 
[00:38:00]  Like, and then you would sit back for maybe five seconds.  And then some calamity would happen.  And then you would decide some dumb little thing.  Like, ah, you know what?  I don't need this dumb toilet over here or whatever.  Yeah.  And that would just make the whole thing go into chaos.  All of a sudden you got the water nowhere on your fucking...  That was the most frustrating thing.  Running pipes.  And then you're like, come on, man.  That fucking running pipes shit.  Enough already.  I get it.  That was like, I mean, I tried not to cheat.  I would always try to get more money, of course, like everybody else.  But the one thing I didn't give a fuck about cheating on was the underground piping system.  It was just like, I'm going to look up how to do it. 
[00:38:30]  I'm going to fucking lay out a whole grand, not give a fuck.  Right.  And fuck it.  Enough with the water.  I don't want to hear any complaints.  Enough.  So why did you go there?  Oh, just...  It's really an out-of-the-way place.  Yeah.  I was just taking a little hike with a girl.  We were just going around.  Walking around.  You walked there?  Yeah.  I went from...  Your apartment all the way there?  No, no.  I walked from her apartment.  So all the way over. 
[00:39:00]  Because she's kind of by the bridge.  For the island.  The walking bridge, you know?  Yep.  And walked over that bridge.  And went around.  Oh, that sounds kind of cool.  It was cool.  And I got some video with the little helicopter thingy.  That was fun.  Did you put it up yet?  And...  Did you get the skyline?  No.  I didn't get the skyline.  I was on the other side.  But I was kind of just walking with it.  Right.  And flying around on the little paths and everything.  But then after that, we went to dinner in Spanish Harlem. 
[00:39:30]  I went to dinner at a restaurant in Spanish Harlem.  It's about fucking time.  It's not bad up there.  It was pretty cool.  Why'd you go up there?  It was kind of close.  This fucking...  Wait.  Yeah.  We were talking about the black thing yesterday.  It wasn't black, though.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Believe me.  People had a lot of fun with that after the show yesterday.  But I walk in this place, and there's three guys playing, like, music, little bongos and 
[00:40:00]  fucking bass guitar and guitar and singing this fucking Spanish music.  And then there's people just, like, dancing, salsa dancing in the middle of the fucking  restaurant.  Those people know how to have fun.  But here's the deal now.  I'm proud of you.  You've explored some different cultures.  Oh, some different culture.  Here's what...  Where did it go wrong?  Where did it go wrong?  No, no, it was cold.  It went very well.  Because I'll take my bike through Harlem every once in a while.  I'm not stupid during the day. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I'm not...  There are times.  I'm not one of those brave liberal douchebags that will fucking walk around in the middle  of the night.  Think everything's hunky-dory.  No, I'm not stupid.  Completely stupid, anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  There...  I noticed this, too.  What kind of food did you get before you move on to this?  I just got some kind of a...  What kind of restaurant?  It was kind of...  Yeah, there was Spanish food there.  Nice.  You know, I got some kind of a steak thing, but it was done, you know, Spanish-type steak  thing.  And what I noticed, though... 
[00:41:00]  Dude, there were...  There had to be six girls that were at the bar with no guys that just wanted to, like, dance.  If you could salsa dance and you're just a single guy, this place is gold.  And they were hot!  Like, hot girls.  They weren't white, though.  No, there were a couple of white girls.  There were...  Actually, they were white, yeah.  And then there were a couple of Spanish girls and stuff.  Were they hookers?  Nope.  Just girls that wanted to be in there, hanging out, and wanted to dance.  And then there were two Spanish guys. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Salsa dancing.  Two Spanish guys.  Ah, yeah.  This is exactly what the music sounded like.  That's nice.  It's hilarious.  And the girls were just fucking dancing with these two guys.  They had the whole fucking...  The run of the joint.  I actually know these places.  Yeah?  Because I went with my current wife once, and a few other people.  The problem with these places, the guys feel like any girl is, you know, available...  Fair game?  Available for dancing, I should say.  Oh, okay.  So they don't even ask. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, they just...  Because it's just a fun little...  They're just moving their hips.  You mind if we dance with your dates?  They don't even say that.  No.  You just grab your girl.  And start dancing.  And give her a little dance.  A little wilding.  A little bit.  There's some wilding going on.  So I kind of understand this a little bit.  It was kind of cool, though.  We went to that place once.  Yeah.  And then it was like, no.  I'm like, all right, come on, dude.  Relax.  Nope.  A little dance is fine, but let's relax a little bit.  Yeah.  That was kind of cool.  Definitely.  Did you walk up there? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Walking all around.  Walked a lot, then.  Walked a lot.  And it was nighttime at the time.  Walking back.  How far up did you go?  I'm not even sure.  It was up there.  Not crazy up there, but up there enough.  Safe up there.  Yeah.  Safe up there.  If you didn't have a carry, would you have still went?  Nope.  That's one thing.  I always say, it's the great equalizer.  And yeah.  So this thing is really expanding your horizon?  It really is expanding.  See, people say that guns are terrible.  But boy, they expand my horizons. 
[00:43:00]  I'm seeing new cultures.  And protecting myself from them at the same time.  It's making you get out of the house?  Exactly.  Weird.  Weird that you would do that.  Why is that?  I don't know.  There's something else to this.  There really isn't anything.  No, there's nothing.  Are you getting illegals up there?  No.  The girl wanted to go and have a nice day.  I know.  That's what it was.  That's what it was.  Out of respect, I want to ask some questions.  No, she's just like...  You must...  All the dumb shit that you got to do for someone else. 
[00:43:30]  That's it.  That's it.  That's what I'm getting at.  I didn't mind, though, because I wanted to...  All I'm going to say is it sounds like you really liked hanging out with her.  And she could talk you into almost anything.  I just liked going...  That's a good sign that you like her company.  Well, it was cool.  It was fun.  Yeah, it was definitely fun.  I'll give it that.  For sure.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Hanging around.  Did you walk back?  Yep.  Walked back.  Yeah, that was... 
[00:44:00]  It was just...  It was cool.  That's a long walk, man.  Yeah.  Roosevelt Island next?  Retard Island.  That's a cool place.  Retard Island.  You could send that camera...  The helicopter with the camera up to Fezzi's window.  Oh, man.  See what's going on in that house.  Send it up to the cable fucking cars.  Oh, shit.  Cable cars.  That'd be hilarious.  Right.  Fucking...  I saw a clip of Seinfeld from forever ago.  It was, like, earlier than any of his early shit that I've seen.  And he was talking about Roosevelt Island and how he goes, 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, they're putting these cable cars up.  Have you seen these things?  It's like, whoa, wait a minute.  Really?  How long ago did they put those fuckers up?  That'd be a long-ass time ago.  Yeah.  Roosevelt Island tram.  You want to see what happens at the Gay Center?  Yeah, what happens at the Gay Center?  Doug in New York.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Doug.  Hey, O&A.  How's it going?  All right, man.  So, yeah, I used to work at Manhattan Psychiatric Center,  and they used to discharge a bunch of people to the Gay Center. 
[00:45:00]  And basically what it is is a homeless shelter for mostly mentally ill adults.  Wow.  So it's the homeless shelter for the lunatics.  They get out of the loony bin over there,  and then they got nowhere to go, so they shove them over there.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Damn.  So the homeboys are like, yeah, I'm just looking out for you.  Just looking out for you.  See?  They don't see color.  Why do you see color? 
[00:45:30]  Well, they saw color.  They saw two white people ready to get fucking raped and mugged.  Little did they know.  You were the Charles Bronson.  Oh, my God.  I was kind of like, I turned to the homie.  I was just like, hey, thanks.  You know, thanks.  And we didn't walk down the little roadway to the shelter.  Did you feel just a little bit less racist after that exchange?  No, I thought I was being set up.  Oh, really?  I was like, wait, he don't want one of the other guys getting these easy pickings, 
[00:46:00]  white people pickings.  He's sending me over there so one of his boys can take care of me.  And it's not wrong to think that.  No.  It was, yeah, I'm always on guard, but I didn't get a bad vibe from any of those guys.  They were cool.  Yeah.  But, but no, I definitely, yeah, I definitely felt there was something going on down that road.  Yeah.  Yo, man, I wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't go there if I was you.  Well, we got a lot of things to do today.  Yes, we do. 
[00:46:30]  Joe DeRosa's coming in.  Oh, we like when Joe comes in.  What does Bill call him?  Sensation.  Teen sensation.  Teen sensation.  Not so much these days.  Teen sensation.  And we got the Mike Francesa rant that went around yesterday afternoon.  I guess he lost his mind or about something.  Yeah, Florentine tweeted it and I think it's on Deadspin.  We're going to, we got the highlights of it.  He just lost his fucking mind over a dumb baseball team.  Over a dumb baseball thing?  Is that what it was?  Yeah, I'm trying to think if I would get this upset over, over one of my teams. 
[00:47:00]  One of your teams?  I get frustrated.  Is it one of his teams?  Did he have a personal interest in it?  Yeah, Mets.  The Mets.  Okay.  Have you been following the Mets?  No.  They completely stink.  They fell apart?  Completely fell apart.  Beginning of the season, people had hope.  Not really hope, but there was no hope.  And then they started doing well and you're like, oh, well, maybe there's hope.  And then they just went.  They, I think they have lost, no, they certainly have lost more home games than not in recent weeks.  I think they've lost 14 out of 16 home games. 
[00:47:30]  Holy shit.  If that's possible even.  What's their record for the last 30 games?  Someone that follows the Mets way more than me, please tell me.  But, I mean, they're on a horrendous run.  A horrendous run.  Fucking Jeter's cranking the ball.  Last 10 is 2-8.  Last 10 is 2-8.  Yeah.  So, with a five-game losing streak.  So, Francesa had it and just went off and we got the audio next for everybody.  Goody.  And then the Dana White situation. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  With Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen.  What the hell was that about?  Well, he wanted Jon Jones to fight Chael Sonnen on eight days notice.  I don't know how I feel about this.  And what happened?  A lot of people are hating on Jon Jones.  Yeah.  You got to do what the boss says.  You think?  Fuck yeah.  In that situation.  But why would Dana White put him in a situation like that?  To fight with only eight days?  Because he's got to get a fucking card.  I mean, granted, Jon Jones, I'm sure, is training. 
[00:48:30]  But he's not training for maybe someone like Chael Sonnen.  Is that what he was claiming?  Like, hey, this isn't enough time for me to train?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  But because he's not fighting, Chael Sonnen, Dana White,  canceled UFC 151.  Yeah.  That's a big fucking deal.  A lot of guys are going to go without a payday.  And they're all pointing fingers at Jon Jones.  Jon Jones is getting a lot of heat today in the UFC world.  Wait, hold the phone here. 
[00:49:00]  How come they have a 151 planned, but...  In eight days, like a week from Saturday, whatever it would be.  And they have the...  Well, Henderson got hurt.  It was going to be...  Oh, okay.  So then, uh...  All right.  I didn't know that happened.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  We're trying to get Dana White on the phone.  Someone's got to step up, though.  We got the audio of Dana White going off.  He's fucking pissed.  I gather.  And then Chael Sonnen's going after Jon Jones.  It's a great...  A little fucking... 
[00:49:30]  It's a great story.  They got an angle.  Holy fuck, yeah.  A lot of things are being said.  They're not as polite in the UFC as other sports,  and I love that about the UFC.  I hate that fucking sportsmanship, fake horse shit.  I hate sportsmanship.  No, because it's fake.  I know, yeah.  That's why I hate it.  They're all on their best behavior,  because these dumb leagues will fine anyone  if they don't, you know, toe the company line  where everything is, you know...  Yeah.  Everything is great.  Don't badmouth the other guy.  When something goes wrong in the UFC, you know it. 
[00:50:00]  Everyone, you know, speaks out.  Yeah.  And no one gets fined in the end.  It's great.  Another reason why the UFC is so good.  So we'll get into that as well?  Sure we will.  And let's not forget Rotgut, Anthony's old band.  See?  Oh, nice.  It's on the list.  See, look what I'd do.  Yeah.  You're reuniting with your old band.  Yes.  A week from tonight.  A week from this very evening.  9 p.m. at KJ Farrell's.  That's 242 Pettit Avenue in Belmore.  It's going to be quite a treat. 
[00:50:30]  I got another rehearsal on Saturday with the guys.  How many rehearsals before you do this?  Well, the band is rehearsed probably five times.  And the whole time they're like, why isn't Anthony here?  Well, I was very busy.  But I rehearse.  No, they have to get the music together first.  You know, get everything nice and spread away.  Is that what you're saying to yourself?  That's what I tell myself.  That's what I told Joe.  And then I rehearsed twice with them.  But it just takes doing the songs a couple of times each until it just completely falls  back into your memory.  Like, because I totally forgot. 
[00:51:00]  I wrote these fucking things and I forgot them.  But then you do them twice and you're like, oh, yeah, okay.  Now I remember.  Now I remember.  And then we do a couple of other, like, cover songs with the Rotgut songs.  A couple of Chili Peppers tunes and shit like that.  It should just be a fun fucking night.  That's for sure.  And Joe's clamoring that there will be 25 signed Rotgut live from the Apollo CDs.  Is that good?  That I have no idea.  I don't know if that's a punishment. 
[00:51:30]  That sounds kind of cool.  Yeah.  It's a classic, all right.  But it should be a fun night.  Definitely.  Next week.  Okay.  And people are already calling about the Jon Jones thing.  So please, call.  If you're a huge UFC fan and you know more than us, which is most of you, just call.  Because this thing is, you know, it's heating up.  Heating up.  People are pissed.  So.  All right.  E-Rock, hit something.  The OPNT Channel.  One Series XM.  You're worthless and weak. 
[00:52:00]  I carried an M-16 and you, you carry that, that, that guitar.  Who are you?  Where do you come from?  What do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me?  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  What do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me? 
[00:52:30]  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  You are a disgusting slob.  Stand up straight.  Tuck in the church.  You are a disgusting slob.  Just let the buckle tie those shoes.  What kind of a man are you?  You do nothing.  You are nothing. 
[00:53:00]  What kind of a man are you?  You do nothing.  You are nothing.  What do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me?  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  What do you want to do with your life?  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:53:30]  It pains me, but I think I have to.  I have to.  We beat the shit out of management.  Everyone knows that.  And I'm embarrassed.  A lot of people will be pointing and laughing.  So we had E-Rock, who was my best friend today.  He was.  Things have drastically changed.  And he did a lot of behind-the-scenes work to figure out how many days off we have. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  That was his mission.  Because I've been battling management about how many days I actually still have to take between now and October.  And I thought we had him nailed because of E-Rock's diligent work behind the scenes.  His calculations.  But he had subcategories, and then he didn't give me the total total.  There's two different totals here that needed to be put together for a total. 
[00:54:30]  But he kept them separate.  And less than an hour ago, we had management nailed.  Yep.  And I couldn't wait to talk to him after the show.  According to what I thought, it looked like I had 12 more days of vacation that I have to use between now and October 1st.  Hey, I had 14.  And Anthony had 14.  He was very psyched.  And because E-Rock didn't add all the totals, and I had to figure that out on my own, why wouldn't you just give me a total in the end with a highlight like, so thus, there's always a thus then. 
[00:55:00]  Thus then, this is how many days you have taken after all the work I've done.  Yeah, when it says Ant's days off total, it should have been my days off that I took, plus the show's days off.  It should just be the total.  The total.  And then, in that, you could put, here's your days, here's the show days, but the total is the total.  Your total is 11 days, but then there's more days here total. 
[00:55:30]  Look, total, total, total, total.  There's four totals.  You're a totaling motherfucker.  It's very detailed.  But E-Rock, you don't add up totals.  The total is the total.  Total sounds weird now when you say it.  Total, total, total.  Total, total, total.  Total.  You don't add up totals, right?  Total is the total.  Total is, that's it.  You could have a subtotal.  You could do subtotal.  Subtotal.  Why didn't you go subtotal?  Why didn't you do a subtotal?  I guess what you have there would be subtotals.  Yeah, but you want.  You don't have the final total.  But see, you're. 
[00:56:00]  You got any total back there?  One.  Stop it.  So one, two.  I have to add up three totals to get another total.  Right.  That don't make sense.  E-Rock.  It should be three subtotals to get the total.  It was not written at the bottom of the page, but for the past, I guess, day now, it's  been explained to you.  E-Rock.  Look, even this box of cereal is stupid.  It says total plus omega-3, so it's not the total.  It's not the total.  Because you still got to add omega-3s in there.  Omega-3s.  It's fucking bullshit.  Yeah, no one understands what the definition of total is.  Right.  Is what I'm learning today. 
[00:56:30]  E-Rock, why wouldn't you have, knowing that all we really needed, the information's great,  and we did want the information.  Well, because we want to nail them.  When they go, well, that can't be right, and we go, well, look at this total over here.  The most important part of this was the total, which was how many days off we took, period.  That is nowhere to be found under Anthony's days off or Opie's days off, a final total.  Yeah, that's the problem. 
[00:57:00]  There's no number there.  Right.  By the way, I have a new plan.  Oh, no.  I do have a new plan.  Because it's not looking good for your boys, Opie and Anthony, right now.  It really isn't.  What the hell?  It was looking really good for us.  Well, it's looking good for you guys, because it looks like you're going to get a few more live shows.  E-Rock.  But it's not looking good for us, because we're just like you.  We try to get as much time off as possible.  Who doesn't love a day off?  You already got approved some days next week.  So an hour ago, I know, that's why I don't even want to bring this up, because knowing 
[00:57:30]  these assholes, they're going to fuck us.  You got...  What?  He approved...  Two extra, right?  ...for next week.  Mm-hmm.  Two, I thought, three.  I heard three for Ant and two for you.  Are you serious?  I may have misheard.  They're making me work a day that he's not working next week?  I don't know what the total is.  What the...  Total.  Ask E-Rock.  He'll fucking tell you what the total is.  Four times, he'll tell you.  Well...  Four totals.  I added up all of E-Rock's totals, and I assume that when it says Opie's days off total, 
[00:58:00]  which was 13 days, and I'm allowed to take 25.  That's so low.  Well, now I know that.  But it said Opie total.  Now I look like a complete and utter asshole, and management gets to fucking point and laugh  as well as others.  What?  Ooh, who's calling you?  Hello?  Kenny, were you calling me, Kenny?  No.  Wait, who's...  Why?  Whose phone is ringing?  Oh, I called you accidentally, Kenny. 
[00:58:30]  What happened there?  I was checking because I saw one of your texts from earlier, I guess.  Would you hang up, Anthony?  There.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the weirdest thing.  Kenny's running out of the studio.  His phone's ringing, and I'm the one calling.  I'm sorry, Kenny.  I got your message from earlier, and I thought it was a new message.  Why does it keep calling you?  I don't know.  I just decided to call you. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, that was me.  Thank you.  Hi, Kenny.  No, I panicked because my phone wasn't on vibrate.  Yeah.  Oh.  Because I'm hoping that Jim Norton is up in L.A. and in a car and on his way to the airport.  All right, you got the big gig in Boston.  Well, north of Boston.  Yeah, New Hampshire tomorrow night.  Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom.  Jim Norton and Dave Attell.  We did an AF beach dig up there.  That's where the beach dig was?  Yes, it was.  We also did a couple of the concerts up there, and I believe there's a strip club very close 
[00:59:30]  to that whole area.  Row.  I wouldn't know, G.H.  I don't partake in those activities.  Why, Kenny?  Come on.  You could look.  You could look.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch, don't taste.  I'm straight edge.  Are you straight edge?  Yeah.  Well, you're allowed to look.  Certainly are.  You're allowed to look.  You're a square.  No, you're allowed to look, Kenny.  The worst thing I do is pull my prick. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, that conjures up a horrid image.  Kenny with his toes bent.  Oh!  Back arched.  Yeah, you're not getting a good one in if you don't.  Toying with yourself.  Bend your toes.  Yeah.  Which way you bend?  Forward?  I don't know.  I have to hide in the shower.  Oh, no.  Kenny.  The shower jerk is amongst the worst jerks ever.  That is a strictly medicinal jerk.  I get pleasure in nothing.  Does she have your showers timed? 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  Probably does.  Probably does.  Oh, he's taking a little long in there.  What's he doing?  Kenny?  Are you okay?  Oh!  There's three fucking bathrooms in the house.  Oh, boy.  Use another one.  Use another one.  Kenny?  Coming!  Coming!  Captain Ned, thank you.  He's from New Hampshire. 
[01:01:00]  Ten's Dance Club is one town away in Southbury.  Ten's Show Club!  I knew it was close to there.  I just got a text from Jim Norton.  He is in route.  He's up.  Really?  Yeah, so people will see him in New Hampshire tomorrow night if they buy a ticket.  Who are you doing the show with?  Mattel?  Dave Mattel and Jim Norton.  Yes.  What a great bill that is.  I don't see that.  Yeah.  And I'll be selling merchandise after the show, so bring extra monies.  Monies?  Be nice to the people, will you? 
[01:01:30]  I'm always nice to the fans.  Take pictures with everybody.  Because without the fans, I'm nothing.  There you go.  So getting back to you, Rock.  So we had to add up all the totals.  We thought we had management nailed.  I thought I had 12 days of vacation left.  And that would give Anthony 14 days of vacation left.  I went from 14 days to you're fucked.  Thanks, E-Rock.  And this is where everyone gets to laugh.  If I'm doing my math right, we actually owe the company some days. 
[01:02:00]  Jesus Christ, E-Rock.  You couldn't fucking...  Couldn't it just put totals, totals?  You couldn't fudge the numbers?  What's the matter with you?  They weren't going to check your work.  You couldn't fudge a couple of these days?  He did fudge them, but then he ate the numbers.  Oh, wait.  I'm being nice to you, Rock.  Why?  I know.  He gave us...  He dangled something in front of us.  He dangled it.  Right.  It's like when you have a dream that you're off.  Right.  You know, you had no school or work that day.  And you're like, oh...  And then you wake up and go, oh, fuck! 
[01:02:30]  I gotta go!  But how are we off by 12 to 14 days?  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Sorry, I thought you would have read what I handed you.  We did!  And I explained totals of totals, usually.  E-Rock, this...  And I explained yesterday, and I explained this morning.  Wait, no, wait, wait, wait.  Yes, I did.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now I gotta argue a little bit.  If it says Opie's days off total, meaning your days...  Yeah!  I get 25, and you're saying I took 13.  You wanted a full breakdown, which is what you got. 
[01:03:00]  Your days total, Anthony's day total, and then the shows.  But you didn't add them!  But your problem is adding the word total.  Right.  You should have just wrote Opie's days off, 13.  Anthony's days off, what does it say, 11.  11.  So, show days off, 6.  And then show days off again, 9, because our contract's weird, so our year's different.  I don't like that either, by the way.  He should have just had that as one subtotal in the year.  It should have been in a subcategory, show totals, 2011, show totals, 2012, for a subtotal 
[01:03:30]  of that of 15 days.  Right.  And then you should have put Anthony's days off, 11.  And then total, total at the bottom with a big, bold number, bigger than any other number  on here.  It should have said total days off, damn.  It always ends with a...  Not to be found here.  Yeah.  Any working environment, any office environment, the boss would kill you on this one. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, it should have been, there's always, we joke about it, but there's always a thus  then.  Right.  After all, all said and done, you can use...  Old man Leland's busting my hump.  You can use that term, too.  When all said and done...  Yes.  This is how many days you have taken.  Right.  I am not an accountant.  You did all the other work brilliantly.  I would have given you one number.  Beautiful idea.  And then in parentheses...  Right.  X individual plus X show. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  So...  One fucking bold type total.  Do you see...  Here's...  That's a page of stuff.  Do you see on this sheet...  Yeah.  ...a number that represents the total number of days off that either I and or Opie have  taken?  No, that part's not...  All right.  Why would you leave that part for us?  That's the most important part of this page is the total number of days.  Right. 
[01:05:00]  The whole reason for this project.  Entire reason.  So why would you just stop there?  You stopped right before the finish line.  You had to do just a little math.  Well, I'm sorry.  I thought when I explained it, I thought it was understood that you knew the breakdown of  it.  Obviously, it wasn't.  Because I went on the air with it thinking it was the other thing.  Yeah, I had no idea why you were doing that.  Because there's no total.  There's a total, but it's not the total.  And here's the other beauty of E-Rock, unless he was trying to get back at me.  He just said, I have no idea why you were doing that. 
[01:05:30]  You have a microphone in front of you.  Why wouldn't you stop as you go, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.  No, that's not how I did this.  Take a look at that paper there.  Because chances are I would have made it worse.  What?  Oh, by clearing it up?  Come on, E-Rock.  Now it's worse because we've got egg on our face.  I've got a little egg on my face right now.  My offer to sell my days still stands.  Oh, man.  I hate when management wins.  $100 a day.  Do I have to do what you would do on those days, though?  Hey, hang out.  I'm a dog.  I could do that. 
[01:06:00]  What?  No, not your dog.  I'm a kid.  Well, management wins today.  Oh, God.  And that pains me to say.  All due to E-Rock.  That pains me to say.  E-Rock helps management.  All because of E-Rock.  Everything.  I mean, the detail on this report is beautiful.  But then he doesn't add it all up in the end.  Just trying to get by.  I don't even know what this is.  You know what?  Dan Smith in Michigan, you're right. 
[01:06:30]  It's called a grand total.  Grand total.  You could have said grand total.  You needed to do subtotal.  Possibly just total.  Definitely grand total would make it very obvious.  Yes, grand total.  And he even puts total in capital letters.  Like, here it is.  Here's your total days you have taken.  Ant stays off total.  And total is capitalized.  That means total.  Per breakdown, yes.  Oh, no.  It doesn't say per breakdown.  And it's the last item on my report.  Oh, God. 
[01:07:00]  Which makes it confusing.  Opie's days off total.  Well, it's on there now.  So I got a new plan.  I don't like giving up easy.  People know that by now.  So I want to know, Iroch.  If he was, I'm getting here.  Iroch, were you distracted by the bikini pics that you look at during the program?  Everybody's wondering.  Bikini pics.  How easy would it be to find out how much extra radio we have done in the last contract year? 
[01:07:30]  Total?  Grand total.  Oh, man.  Damn it.  That's a good bikini picture.  Maybe that's why Iroch's looking at bikini pictures.  I don't play with them now.  Damn.  Oh, man.  Would that be easy, Iroch?  Um, I think that would be well-suited for someone else to do.  Fuck.  Oh, he's passing the buck now.  We've done a few extra hours of radio, right?  I'm sure it's easy to find out.  And every four hours of extra radio means another day for us.  Another day, right? 
[01:08:00]  Carryover minutes?  Yeah, but then management's going to counter by asking Eric to find out all the days you've  left early.  Not many.  No.  Not as many as the days we've gone late.  Not even close.  Thus, then, the argument I had with Bladder.  Not even close.  Telling him he shouldn't care about that at all.  Oh, gosh.  Golly gee.  Now we've got to shred the fucking big report.  Shred Iroch's report.  How many hours does this take, Iroch?  Although we don't even have to shred it.  Just leave it laying around.  No one can decipher how many fucking real days it is. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, maybe they will be tricked, too.  They'll get confused and give us more days.  Maybe they'll be tricked.  It's like, wow, total.  Look at that.  It's only 11 days.  It says total.  No, it says total.  It's got to be total.  Show days off total.  Show days off total again.  Which, you're right.  That should be just one total.  It should be one total.  And stay off total.  Opie's day's off total.  Iroch.  No grand total.  One fuck it.  There's even room here.  There was even room there.  On the second page.  Here on the second page.  Plenty of room.  Giant. 
[01:09:00]  Total total.  And when you do a report, isn't that font way bigger?  Way bigger.  Grand total.  Because of me.  In the end, this is what I've figured out.  And why it's bigger?  Because it's the most important part of the report.  Right.  Is the total.  Oh, God.  Oh, Iraq.  And then he doesn't even know how to fudge numbers for us.  God, everyone fudges numbers.  Got it.  This is too detailed, Iraq.  In management's favor.  In management's favor.  Well, how about you read it, you looked it over, and then say, hey, why don't we do something 
[01:09:30]  about this instead of going right on the air and discussing this?  Because the job isn't for us to then check your work.  We assume.  I was very excited.  I had to go on the air immediately with this.  We assume you did a great job of summing it up.  I know it's right.  That's the problem.  It's incomplete.  It's incomplete, your work.  It's incomplete.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  I'm going to have my new buddy, Rob.  Oh, man.  Go over your work.  Or how about Roland?  Because Roland, I hear, took some of the blame for that piggy suit. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, he did.  That was Roland's fucking idea.  Congratulations to management.  They have won one.  Good job.  Fuck.  Thanks, Iraq.  We're not undefeated.  Felt all good about ourselves.  I was fucking planning vacations.  I was winging all over this nation.  You had like three weeks to take in the next month.  Exactly.  Our Cal Ripken streak is over.  Done.  Management finally wins one.  Jesus Christ.  Damn it.  I feel really bad now that you guys have to wait until October to take more vacation. 
[01:10:30]  Exactly.  You guys are going to wait a month.  I know.  It's terrible.  How are you guys going to get by?  I don't know.  I'll have to take a...  Now where are you going to spend all that money?  Exactly.  Damn it.  Oh, E-Rock.  Fez is doing a show by himself today?  What?  Well, that'll be a total reversal.  People are saying it's going to be epic.  Dom in Buffalo.  Who, uh...  And why is this?  Is it their thing? 
[01:11:00]  Is, um...  I have no idea.  Is it, uh...  Eric, you're the radio expert.  Yeah, E-Rock.  I...  That's news to me.  I wasn't listening to their show yesterday.  Why don't you find out what happened and tell us everything right up until the end?  All right.  We'll do.  He's too busy listening to Bubba replays.  How many radio shows do you listen to a day, E-Rock?  It's all podcasts now.  But how many?  A day?  That's, uh...  Oh.  But I think I'm, like, on eight different podcasts right now.  A day?  Not a day, but just... 
[01:11:30]  That's the problem with podcasts.  It's hard to keep up with everybody.  They're only doing an hour.  I gotta keep up with Louie and Breaking Bad.  I know.  How are you listening to podcasts?  I'm downloading podcasts on my phone all the time.  I'm like, I'm seven behind the awesome body one.  I'm four behind Jay Moores.  I'm two behind Bill Burr.  It's very hard to keep up.  I'm about eight behind.  And then they just keep coming.  More podcasts.  You need to just plug it into your head and download it into your brain.  Right.  So you just know what it is without having to listen.  Well, someone did the research on the Mets for us. 
[01:12:00]  Because I just know this much.  They really suck lately.  And here's the breakdown.  The Mets in the last 40 games.  11-29.  Total?  Total.  That's the grand total, sir.  That's a 275 win percentage.  Holy fuck.  They're way below 500, obviously.  Yeah, Mike talks all about that.  But the problem is the Mets were 46-39 at one point.  In June, they were in first place.  46-39 is a great record in Major League Baseball.  Yeah, they were doing very well.  Not a good record.  A great record. 
[01:12:30]  And they weren't supposed to, either.  At the beginning of the season, everybody's like, oh boy.  Maybe not a great record.  Now they're living up to expectations.  Yes.  So since they were 46-39, they're now 57-68.  Yeah, they're not good.  11 games under 500.  And they just got swept by the Rockies, who were like 30 games under 500.  Wow.  They got swept by the Rockies.  He's a shitty team.  Mike Francesa calls them a triple-A team.  Yeah, they're my team.  And that's what's got Mike Francesa going.  And that's why everyone is talking about this today.  Mike's a little rambunctious. 
[01:13:00]  Danny.  That's Danny's fart?  Danny's just fucking blasting farts out at an alarming rate.  What do you eat?  I don't know.  Nothing.  This is Danny.  I think somebody put some milk in my coffee.  Oh, a little lactose intolerance.  I still want to have the gas off.  I just haven't been able to figure out how it's going to work.  Because it's a timing thing.  We all have to figure out when we're at our most...  At our worst.  Well, I think there's just a level...  At your most gaseous state.  There's just a...  Yeah, but then I have to back-eat.  So my farts happen now. 
[01:13:30]  So does that mean get up in the middle of the night to fucking eat the shit that makes me gassy?  I mean, if we were going to do this, I would probably spend the morning eating...  From the time I get up, all on the train, just eating whatever's going to make it happen for me.  And what's the criteria?  Is it a bad smell or is it a sound?  I just want everyone...  You obviously aren't going to do it.  I just don't.  It's going to come down to...  It's going to come down to smell.  Yeah, because everyone's going to laugh at the sounds.  But I mean, the sounds are always funny.  I'm hoping that it gets to a point where it's like the mixes or whatever is just so fucking bad. 
[01:14:00]  Someone's going to let one out and someone else is going to tap out.  Me, Jimmy, and Danny are in on this one.  I haven't farted as much during the show as I used to.  I don't know why.  What happened?  I changed my diet or something.  I don't know.  But we know our bodies.  We know what makes it work.  I know grapes will do it for me.  If I eat enough grapes and drink some milk, I'm good.  There's a shitload of grapes.  But then you've got to pad it with shit where the air goes through that.  It's a whole thing. 
[01:14:30]  I don't doubt it.  This is some Mythbusters shit.  I'm all about my sour cream.  Time it.  So from 6 to 10, we're just having horrendous farts and trying to knock the other guy out.  Ange bought this chili for the house.  Nice.  And it's fucking lethal.  I had some, like, months ago.  And it was in the fridge again.  And I either forgot or I was just tempted.  And I had some.  I was on the bowl. 
[01:15:00]  I swear, the smell was like epoxy.  It smelled like epoxy.  Did it have that smell of actual gas?  Yes, like natural gas.  It smelled like a refinery.  Rotting natural gas.  Like a refinery.  It's like oily.  Yes, like crude oil.  It did.  But crude oil, that's, I don't know, rotting or however the fuck that happens.  Oh, my God.  I get it.  And it just, when you wipe, it just feels like you're trying to pick up, I don't know, like an oil spill. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And it just never ends.  God.  Am I ever going to be able to get up off this thing?  That's one sign we're getting older, because now I time when I eat chili.  Oh, boy.  Because, you know, I don't want to gas out my family or friends.  So then you're like, fuck, I want this chili, but I'm going to be hanging out with too many people in the next 24 hours.  Oh, man.  My fucking, like, my carbon monoxide detectors were going off. 
[01:16:00]  It couldn't even identify that gas.  It's got to be something lethal.  Yeah, it was bad.  Heat the pool on it.  Yeah, I could just fart into a pipe and heat my pool.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  People are mocking us because we have no days off.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuckers.  Like, you wouldn't do the same.  I love the people that make believe they wouldn't do the same.  Yeah.  Take advantage of the situation.  Yeah, you're the goody two-shoes.  Okay. 
[01:16:30]  Really.  So here's Mike Francesa.  We were supposed to do the John Jones thing, because the phone's lit with that.  I hope those people hang out, because we want to talk to you guys about the John Jones-Chel  Sonnen thing with Dana White, because that audio's great, too.  But first, Mike Francesa going off on the horrible Mets, who were sweeped by a horrible team, the  Rockies.  At home, too, right?  Yes.  Oof.  And that Colorado team came in here, they came in here playing baseball.  That is ridiculous.  They were 46-73, with the worst pitching in the world, and the Mets can't get a run. 
[01:17:00]  The Mets have become such an embarrassment.  They have become a bigger embarrassment than they were on the manual.  I mean, Terry Collins is starting to sound like Cotite.  And he is accepting.  I watched it last night.  All they talked about after the game was that drove me crazy.  All they talked about, well, you know, we got a couple of good at-bats late.  We were within a run. 
[01:17:30]  You're playing a team that stinks.  You're playing a team full of minor leaguers.  He's just getting going.  That comes in here and sweeps you four games.  Well, you know, we're in these games.  In these games, the team is 46-73 when they came in here.  They beat you four straight games.  And they don't have anybody in the lineup.  Wow.  Do you understand, though?  He's fucking freak.  The Mets got sweeped by a team that is 46-73 at home. 
[01:18:00]  And then they said I touched a child.  How great is this?  We usually beat up Mike Francesa, but this is great radio.  Yeah, yeah.  He does this every day.  I'm listening.  He's going at it, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  The Mets and Terry Collins have become completely accepting of this garbage.  Well, you know, what are we going to do?  You know, just come out here tomorrow and try again. 
[01:18:30]  Thank God the Astros are here.  We might be able to beat them again.  They're 6-33 in their last 39 games.  The Mets are 12-30 in their last 42 games.  Wow.  12-30.  Do you know they've lost 14 of their last 16 home games?  Wow.  They have not scored more than two runs in a week.  You have to go back to 82, which was the black hole of Met Baseball, to see the last time that happened. 
[01:19:00]  This team has reached a low point that is unbelievable, that this season could become like this, and now you can see it.  You know, the idea, the thing we talked about and we raved about about Terry Collins was that he was not accepting of this garbage.  He has become accepting of it.  Last night, he wasn't even angry after the game. 
[01:19:30]  Well, you know, we had a couple of good bad.  What, because Ronnie Sedanio fouled off a couple of pitches before he made out?  Now that's what you're looking for?  Dude, it's the greatest audio ever.  I've never liked Francesca.  I haven't heard audio this good in years.  In years.  Because he's passionate, obviously.  He is screaming.  Anyone could scream and make it sound good.  Wow.  This is coming from his soul.  He sounds like fucking Mad Dog would get.  Like, Mad Dog would get like this, and that was like, okay, Mad Dog's off on a tear. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  But Mike was always, well, dog, you know.  Yeah.  This, he's out of his fucking mind about the Mets.  It sounds like a wrestling promo when it got real.  Like, oh, shit, this is a fucking shoot right now.  He really means this.  Yeah.  This proves I don't give a fuck about the Mets, because it's hilarious.  You know, I realize I'm not a fan.  I try to make believe I still am, I guess.  I'm just not a fan, because this doesn't bother me at all.  This is just really funny.  But there are guys out there that are living and dying by the Mets, and they're out of their minds. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, do you know how many guys are listening to this going in their cars?  Yeah!  Yeah, Mike!  You think more people like that, or more people laughing how funny it is?  Oh, cracking up, too.  I hope so, because this is great.  That's what you're looking for?  Today, Val to speak.  Couldn't get a bunt down.  Blew a ball in center field in a nothing-nothing game.  And did you watch as Baxter, on a base hit, got forced at second?  If I saw that in a Little League game, I'd be upset. 
[01:21:00]  On a base hit in front of him, he got nailed at second base!  This is Major League Baseball.  You're actually paying to watch this!  Holy shit!  He's losing his mind.  The eight people who were there today, give them their money back!  What?  You've got to be kidding me! 
[01:21:30]  The eight people over there.  If I was the manager, I'd jump off the roof!  If I was my team.  Wait, the Mets aren't even his team?  No, he said he was the manager.  Oh, manager, manager, manager.  Yeah.  Okay.  How many people are going to these games?  Eight.  Holy shit.  Eight people.  Give them money back!  Bobo and his uncle and his friends.  Yes, yes.  Unlike E-Rock, these sports franchises know how to fudge numbers, so...  I don't know what number they're telling the people that are going to the games.  I want to know the actual number. 
[01:22:00]  A nice city field over there, just fucking being used for Little League.  Fuck, E-Rock?  Fuck!  You're going to get me going on a Mike Francesa rant.  I can't count on you.  You fudged the numbers in your report.  You said I had 11 days off total?  And then you put another two totals here?  I don't even know how many days off I got!  You gotta be kidding me! 
[01:22:30]  If I was E-Rock, I'd jump off the roof!  Fuck, E-Rock, you make...  This is what you do.  You make the report so complicated...  Yeah.  ...that their head spin.  And then you put the grand total, because that tricks everyone.  There you go, there's the grand total.  There's the grand total.  And here's all the work I did.  You can decipher this, but you might have a tough time reading my handwriting, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  You do it in handwriting.  They're saying that 22,000 people were there yesterday.  Yeah, that's just not right.  That was the attendance, 22,554.  See how that's done, E-Rock? 
[01:23:00]  I bet you there was less than 15,000 there yesterday.  Oh, good for them.  See, E-Rock, you gotta figure it out.  You fudge.  You gotta figure...  You know how...  Remember how Jerry Lundegaard fudged the VIN numbers on the credit form to GMAC?  Right.  Yeah, yeah, Opie and Anthony, I'll fax those numbers.  I'll send them right over.  Right.  What a great scene.  You gotta be more like Jerry Lundegaard and dull down your pencil tip.  I love golfers. 
[01:23:30]  I love food.  I love food.  He's doodling on it.  Getting the pencil tip all fucked up so you can fudge those numbers.  Right.  I'll fax it right over, Dad.  I mean, send it.  I mean, I'll send it right over.  I mean, send it right over.  Uh-huh.  We're pretty busy, but that's the way we like it.  It's just about time for another viewing, I think.  Oh, hell yeah.  It's always time.  And just like that movie, we're gonna just file this in the garbage and just hope no one  notices.  Oh.  What?  Do you think we don't know how many days off we have? 
[01:24:00]  I'll go look.  Jeez.  Ah, with the Christ.  Ah, with the Christ.  11 days total.  Ah, with the Christ.  I'll do a day count right now.  He's fleeing the studio.  He's fleeing the studio.  Fuck, E-Rog.  Fuck.  Oh, E-Rog.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  You let management win today.  Uh, fuck.  Hey, hey, hey, management.  Oh, E-Square. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, E-Square.  Oh, yeah.  Stop beating me by a half second.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Give me those fucking days off.  Who the fuck are you?  See, now they're gonna be like, if they still give us our days off next week, because they  added a couple days.  Yeah.  Now they're gonna be like, look, I'm doing you a favor.  Yeah, now they're doing us a favor.  Yeah, I decided not to take the day off.  Well, you already took it.  You can't.  Nah, I decided.  Oh, yeah.  You're gonna take my fucking days off? 
[01:25:00]  Big, big man.  Big king clip on tie.  What makes the Francesa Rand even better?  He's our diehard Yankees fan.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  He just...  You know what it is?  Which makes us great.  I'm upset that baseball is being played like this.  Yeah, of course.  What a purist.  I haven't paid attention, so I don't know.  The Mets really stink this year.  Here's more of the Mike Francesa rant.  And now all you hear is, oh, Harvey. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, wow.  Harvey.  You know, he struck out more guys than Nolan Ryan.  Are you trying to tell me now Harvey's gonna be Nolan Ryan?  See, what the Mets are trying to do now is sell you that these pitchers, who until a couple  of weeks you had never heard of, are now the reason to believe.  When was the last time the Mets talked about McHugh before yesterday?  Now today, oh, he did something today that hadn't been done since.  Juan Marichal.  He's facing a triple-A lineup. 
[01:26:00]  You forget one thing.  They just got swept by a team that came in at 46-73.  He's so mad.  They didn't get swept by the Giants.  They didn't get swept by the Nats.  Colorado came in and pitched their starting pitches three innings.  I feel like my dad's yelling at me.  It was like watching a spring training game today. 
[01:26:30]  They pitched their starter three innings.  And the Mets didn't score a run.  Why do they only pitch them three innings?  That's weird.  I don't know.  I didn't watch.  I don't know either.  He's making me want to watch the Mets, though.  Oh, fuck.  To just watch horrible baseball being played.  He's as passionate about the Mets as Mel Gibson was about that blowjob before the hot tub.  That blowjob, yes.  Mike Francesa.  Blow me, Mets!  I let you get home runs before the hot tub.  So it went on for another, like, five minutes. 
[01:27:00]  I know.  I'm thinking maybe we should play more.  Oh, my God.  It's great.  If you want to play the rest, you can play the rest.  But that's as...  Oh, wait.  This is...  And then it's five minutes from here?  Yeah.  Just about that.  Let's try it.  You want to do it?  Sure.  Play a little bit of that.  That's fucking great.  That's as upset as he got.  No, I understand.  I heard the whole thing.  I was howling the entire time.  So, E-Rock, we're going to link this to our Facebook page?  Of course.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  One word.  Like us. 
[01:27:30]  It makes us feel good.  Yeah.  Like all our shit.  It makes us feel good.  Retweet our shit.  It makes us feel good.  Favorite our stuff.  It really makes us feel good.  Share our stuff.  It makes us feel good.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  And Anthony Comey on Twitter.  Did you hit the 100,000?  Oh, probably not.  Let's see.  I'm going to look right now.  I'm so close.  You want me to retweet you?  Retweet me, man.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  You're getting there, though.  What's going to happen today?  Man.  Just follow us on Twitter. 
[01:28:00]  That's all we want in the end.  Jesus H. Christ.  You want to try it?  This is more of the rant from Mike Francesa.  And the Mets didn't score a run.  Well, you know, we're in these games.  Really?  He's starting to sound like Cotite.  Oh, I heard this part.  Cotite.  Well, no, that's what I'm saying.  Oh, he keeps going back.  This has reached.  I'm telling you right now.  If I were the owner, if I was Jeff Wilpon, if I'm Sandy Olsen, I would be afraid to show 
[01:28:30]  my face in public.  That's how bad this has been now.  Listen, we gave them credit when they deserved it this year.  But I've never seen a team die like this team.  They have guys in this lineup now who look like they don't even know what they're supposed  to do in the box.  Have you watched Murphy lately?  Have you watched Josh Toley lately?  They're getting beat on 80 mile an hour fastballs. 
[01:29:00]  We all know that's bad.  You've got to be kidding me.  I'm not watching it anymore because I get too mad.  I can't take it.  When I saw Baxter, can someone explain to me what Baxter was doing today?  How he got forced in second on a base hit in front of him?  Can you pause this for a second?  I feel like I'm listening to him talk about the Bad News Bears.  Yes.  Is that what I mean?  Yes.  These guys are professionals.  They've come up with baseball. 
[01:29:30]  They've lived their whole lives playing baseball.  And he's making them sound like they've never played the game before.  Did you see Tanner Boyle dropped the fucking ball in the outfield?  What happened?  Why is he up in the tree?  And what's Leek doing at the plate?  Right.  Black kid up in the tree.  Fuck.  If Matt Thau can't coach these kids, Buttermaker should jump off a roof. 
[01:30:00]  He should drown himself in one of the pools he's supposed to be cleaning.  Team salary, $93.6 million.  Damn.  Is that good?  Nice.  That's a lot.  That's up there, right?  Yeah, we're about halfway.  Right in the middle of all the teams.  I don't know what Lupus is even doing on the team.  He's terrible.  He can't even defend himself.  Get yourself out of the garbage, kid. 
[01:30:30]  That scene is so sad where they fucking squeeze the ketchup on the poor kid.  Oh, yeah.  Poor kid.  Let's go back to the thing.  I love the thing.  It's like my favorite flick.  Let's go back to this.  That's a good one.  By the way, Iraq fucked up.  Listen, I know.  Sorry.  Iraq fucked up yesterday with the Bruce Willis film.  Everyone pointed it out on Twitter yesterday.  What happened?  Kevin Bacon.  He just fucked up with the Kevin Bacon.  Kevin Bacon.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[01:31:00]  Shit.  And then Opie doesn't even know what he's talking about with Iraq.  Fuck.  Damn it.  I'm losing everything today.  My throat's going to be raw because I'm going to do this all day.  Yeah.  Just yell like Francesa.  And this was at the top of his show, too.  He had to do a show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  He had to do the whole show.  Let's listen to the rest of this.  It's almost all.  Kevin Bacon has no idea how to play.  Okay?  I understand that.  We understand that.  He's not an outfielder.  He can't lay down a bunt. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, he ran into a couple of fastballs as a pinch hitter.  That's going to be this.  That is going to be his whole career.  But you can see what the Mets are trying to do to you now.  They are trying to make it seem that Seaver and Kuzman are around the corner.  You know what?  They're not.  Maybe one of these guys is going to be a star.  But I guarantee you they're all not going to be stars.  The Mets have tried this nonsense before.  Okay?  Do I have to bring back the names?  Yes. 
[01:32:00]  Let me tell you how many times they've tried this before with the kid pitches.  We're waiting.  We're waiting for Generation K.  We're waiting.  We're still waiting for Bill Pulsar.  And I like him.  We're still waiting for him.  These guys, in the last couple of days, they pitched against a Colorado team that is awful.  That has nobody in the lineup. 
[01:32:30]  Colorado came in and bunted and you threw away bunts and ran in a couple of gimmick plays and made them all work.  And the Mets made errors, made errors on the bases, made outs on the bases, never got a clutch hit, never scored a run.  And you had the manager had the goal to stand there last night.  You know what?  Hey, you know what?  We had a couple of good at-bats late.  Why?  Because he fouled off a couple of pitches.  His voice goes up.  His voice goes up. 
[01:33:00]  It's great.  12 and 30, 2 and 14 in their last 16 games.  And they just got swept at home by a team that came in at 46 and 73 with the worst pitching staff in the major leagues.  The last time the Mets hit a homer, Cleon Jones was on the team. 
[01:33:30]  They don't hit a lot of homers, huh?  Yeah, Drew Boogie should make a song out of this rant.  You've got to be kidding me.  I mean, how do you watch this?  I mean, I don't want to hear about these pitches.  The first eight questions last night.  Well, what did you think?  Well, are you amazed?  Are you amazed that he threw 96?  Are you amazed that he should?  They stink!  They stink!  You can't lose four straight games to the Colorado Rockies when they have a minor league team they brought in here. 
[01:34:00]  Can you imagine what the Rocky coaching staff was saying?  Could you believe we beat these guys?  Can you believe our guys beat these guys?  I got Mr. Met on watch here.  He's so depressed.  Mr. Met on watch.  And the one thing that we said about Terry Collins and he said about himself is we are not accepting of an attitude that is losing, of mediocrity, of mistakes. 
[01:34:30]  And now he has been beaten down to the point where he is completely accepting of their garbage.  He was last night.  He was today.  And that means total death for this team. 
[01:35:00]  I don't have to ask Terry anymore if this team has quit on him.  I know it has.  Man.  Here's Bob.  WFAN.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was pretty goddamn good.  That was a good lesson.  That was some of the best fucking Francesa I've heard in years and years and years.  Oh, yeah.  He was yelling.  People are talking about this?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's everywhere.  Big story.  He must be very happy that people are talking about him like that. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, it's huge.  That's a funny story today.  All the sports bloggers are all about it.  I bet Mad Dog heard that, but only like when the mics are off and he's yelling at Mad Dog.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've heard that one before.  I remember one time he was lambasted me about something.  I don't like when he yells like that.  Like that.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, that's good.  There's nothing to say after that.  That's just amazing audio. 
[01:36:00]  We'll get into the UFC thing next.  The people that were on hold, I understand you had to go somewhere else, but now call back, please.  Because that audio is great.  Yeah.  A lot of great audio today.  Dana White going off because Jon Jones doesn't want to fight Chael Sonnen on eight days notice.  Yep.  And, oh, wow.  Teen sensation.  Teen heartthrob.  Joe's here.  Joe DeRosa.  Joe DeRosa joins the show next.  Sensation.  Uh, Iraq Fudge something, please. 
[01:36:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Hey, buddy.  Welcome to Antonio's.  Sit down.  What are you looking for?  A simple trim?  Straight black hair.  Do not rake.  Well, we can't do much as far as color.  I bleach brown hair sometimes.  Okay, you do that.  What is it you want me to do for you?  Want a nice big hair with a lot of body.  Body?  Get a hairstyle.  Look like a hot stew. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  I can give it a try, but I can't make no promises.  I get tears for fears.  The who's for what?  I get a frock of a seagull.  What's that, like a fegal or thing?  Do not rake.  Not attractive to a female.  Well, whatever you say, karate kid.  How about I take some off the sides, leave it long on the back.  Look like a Bay City roller.  Yeah, sure, whatever you say.  So, uh, no ladies in your life?  When trying to get an American girlfriend. 
[01:37:30]  So that's why you're here.  Well, you gotta just keep trying out there, buddy.  Uh, hungry like a wolf.  Yeah, well, there's a sandwich place down the block.  Well, there you go.  What do you think?  I look very sexy.  Yeah, right.  Great.  Look good.  Glad you're satisfied.  All right, food man, Shu.  Hit the bricks.  I get on there with a skateboard.  Wrong board. 
[01:38:00]  He forgot his fucking glasses.  Hey, buddy, you forgot.  Yikes.  That's not what I meant when I said a little off the top.  Have you ever wondered how much vomit it would take to fill up a Crown Victoria?  How many nipples would it take to blanket Rhode Island? 
[01:38:30]  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my journey of knowledge and discovery  to find answers to some of the awe-inspiring questions man has pondered since the dawn of time.  Today, we'll answer the question,  how many clits would it take to fill up a bathtub?  With the average adult clit measuring 46.25 cubic millimeters  and one gallon equaling 3,785,412 cubic millimeters,  that means there are 81,846 clits per gallon, or CPG. 
[01:39:00]  The average U.S. bathtub can hold 60 gallons.  That brings us to a grand total of 4,910,760 clits to fill a bathtub.  If you stack the average clit end-to-end,  you would need 96.5 billion clits to get from the Earth to the moon.  So get slicing, you tribesmen.  You expect me to cut off all those clits myself?  Stay tuned for another edition of How Much? 
[01:39:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, Joe DeRozza, you've walked into a fucking shitstorm, man. 
[01:40:00]  What happened? I heard some of the sports stuff.  Oh, that was great, wasn't it?  It was hilarious.  What the fuck in Francisco? Losing his mind.  Don't go, don't go, don't go.  No shitstorm, I'm just saying.  No.  I was excited.  Man, I'll tell you one thing.  Taking a piss when you got boxer briefs on.  Right.  And a short zipper pants.  Pants are like a short zipper and a belt.  It's like you got to weave your dick through a labyrinth. 
[01:40:30]  It's like all kinds of twists and turns it's got to make before you can fucking piss.  Don't you just pull down your boxers?  What?  What?  No, I had to go.  That's why it's boxer briefs.  I had to go through the zipper.  I never go through the zipper.  And then out the leg of the fucking.  Oh, why?  Because it's all over.  It's like fucking snaking it out.  You can't pull your pants and your boxers down and still have everything covered?  You like unbutton?  Oh.  It's just harder. 
[01:41:00]  Gotcha.  You unbutton and pull it all down in the front?  Like a fucking eight-year-old in front of the potty.  Eight in front of a potty one?  I never go through my zipper.  I go through the zipper, too.  I know what you're talking about, because I wear briefs.  And it's like that opening.  It's like there's something clamping your dick right at the base.  It's useless.  Yeah, it's tough.  The opening's useless.  You always go through the leg or the top in some circumstances.  But the leg, you can just grab two fingers and pull that fucker aside.  What do you mean like an eight-year-old?  Adults don't do that. 
[01:41:30]  They stand there at the toilet with both hands pulling down the front of their pants and just fucking pissing.  Standing on a little step stool.  You know, because I'm one of seven, and sometimes it was like one of ten,  depending on who they brought in to my house when I was growing up.  So I never learned things.  Why?  Like, I don't know how to tie my shoe.  Come on.  I do rabbit ears.  No!  To this day.  Do you still sing the song when you tie your shoe? 
[01:42:00]  I do, though.  You make the knot.  To this day.  And then you make a loop and a loop and tie the loop together.  To this day.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my gosh.  And I don't even know how to do it the other way.  Stop it.  Do you know how to tie a tie?  Sort of.  Tie?  It's always, like, crooked, because I'm missing a step.  You know what I'm saying?  Would you wear a clip-on tie if you could?  No, no, no, no.  You can't clip-on tie.  No, I try.  And then I have to push the knot over to bounce it out. 
[01:42:30]  It always is to one side, because I'm missing one step.  You don't know how to make the V in the middle, the little dent?  No.  At the top?  No.  You've got to make that.  That's called the vicious V.  Oh, in the knot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, under the knot, like, where the...  Right below where the tie starts has got to be the little, like, dent.  Yeah, that's called the vicious V.  Oh, isn't it?  Somebody told me once.  Who told you that?  Some queen.  Exactly.  Vicious V.  To prove, look.  So I got these shoes, right? 
[01:43:00]  This is how I tie my shoe.  All right.  To this day.  Giving us an exclusive demonstration.  There's the knot.  One loop.  There's one bunny foo-foo.  Hold it.  One loop.  One loop.  And there you go.  Every fucking time.  I don't know how to do it any other way.  Now, what's the big difference, though, by doing it the other way?  I guess you're more of a man if you do it the other way.  I will concur, but what's the difference in the knot, really?  But I don't know how to do it the other way.  And then you double knot it.  I never learned.  I always double knot.  You do a double knot?  Always.  I used to do a double...  Some laces, some shoes need a double knot. 
[01:43:30]  Mine, no.  Not my sneakers.  Dress shoes need a double knot.  You're constantly fucking, like, those stupid dress shoe laces.  Yeah, because there's too much wax on them.  It's like wax on them.  Yeah, they just slip right out.  Right.  I don't need a double.  Am I mad?  I don't need a double knot ever.  Not even with the dress shoes.  What are you, a faggot?  It always comes down to that.  Yeah, that's the problem.  That's what it is.  There's so much cum on the laces that they just stick together.  I don't need to double knot them.  No, I don't need a double knot.  I don't need a double knot. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, I never needed a double knot.  Not even with the dress shoes.  And I don't tie my shoes in front of anyone.  Do you have to tie your shoes then?  Like, during the day?  Do they ever come untied?  And you've got to put your foot up and...  No, what am I, climbing on monkey bars?  The fuck is going to make them cum?  Yeah.  I think this is at one last night.  Jesus. 
[01:44:30]  Joe's laughing.  Oh, God.  What's going to make them cum?  No, they don't cum untied.  You know what?  I have bigger problems with.  I was complaining about this last night.  If I have boots with zippers on them, the fucking zippers always come down.  Really?  On the boots.  That drives me nuts.  What kind of boots are you wearing with zippers on them?  When I wear my knee highs, the zippers come down.  Your go-go boots?  When I go dancing.  Yeah.  I got boots with side zips.  Do you?  Yeah.  I don't think I have any of those.  I wore them on Jimmy Fallon, if you need to know.  Damn. 
[01:45:00]  And they zipped up on the side.  I remember those.  They're nice.  Yeah, you're a lace-up boot kind of guy.  I'm pretty much a lace-up boot guy.  All the way up to his knees.  I like a fucking good boot that, like, it's got the eyelets, but then the whole top of  it are those criss-crossy fucking little hook things that you got to go back and forth  and then fucking, yeah, like military boots.  That's kind of fun when you figure that out, too.  It's great.  I have, sometimes you miss when you're like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I have a pair of those boots with those, I know what you mean, those fucking army hooks 
[01:45:30]  all the way to the top.  Those little army hook things, yeah.  And they're great.  The boots I have are great, but when I fell in those once, because on the other side,  on ice, I slipped.  Yeah.  And you are fucked, man, because your leg is immobile.  You know what I mean?  I thought that was good.  It really grips your leg in.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like your ankle and your calf?  It's like having a stick taped to your leg.  So, like, if you slip or something, it's like you cannot flex any of this.  Oh, you can't get your balance or anything back?  Yeah, because it's like the bottom. 
[01:46:00]  It's like your ankles are glued to your fucking, you know, when they have to glue somebody's ankle.  Why would the army give their guys boots that might fuck up their feet?  Are you saying they should wear fucking high heels or something?  Maybe there's a conspiracy there.  It's a conspiracy.  They're giving our boys boots that don't work.  Listen to DeRosa.  He'll tell you.  He'll tell you.  Thank you for your service.  Hey, why do they have to say which guy shot Bin Laden there? 
[01:46:30]  I don't know.  What was that about?  What, did he get killed?  It was on your channel, too, the Fox channel.  I heard that, but I didn't hear.  I read some shit that he was killed or something.  The guy that shot Bin Laden.  I don't know if it's true.  Someone's trying to push that on Twitter.  I'm like, I'm not retweeting you.  Because they're saying it's another guy who recently retired.  Yeah, I didn't hear it, so I don't believe it.  But I guess there's a new book that came out about the whole thing.  And the SEALs, they've been just telling everyone, we all did it.  But they all know which guy did it.  And they have decided, we're not telling you which guy did it. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, they just said they all fucking shot him.  But somehow, you know, it got out there.  Wouldn't you just take the shot, though?  Like, even if he's laying there bleeding and dead, I'd just be like, pop, pop, a couple  of more shots in him.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably all did that, I would guess.  Like, hey, take a picture of me.  Look, pop, pop, you're just fucking shooting Bin Laden.  How great would that be if you had a picture of you shooting Bin Laden?  Oh, it's the best.  Talk about trumping anybody's story ever for anything.  Here I am with a fucking six-point buck that I got out there. 
[01:47:30]  And, oh, really?  Here's Bin Laden.  Six-point buck.  The author of No Easy Day, the first-hand account of the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden.  Well, we don't, I don't want to give the fucking guy's name.  No, that's, I mean, Jesus.  Because even if we say the guy's name, no one knows the guy.  So I'm not playing that game.  Put a fucking target on the guy's back.  Well, it's in every paper today.  But it's a 36-year-old, recently retired SEAL.  They're saying he was the actual guy that put that laser sight on his forehead and fucking pulled the trigger. 
[01:48:00]  The media just makes me fucking sick with shit like that.  It's like they know it's fucked up that the guy's name is out there.  And instead of going, you know what?  This guy said his name, but we're not going to say it to add any fuel to this fire.  They're like, okay, well, he said it already, so we can just say it now.  It's like, they're just such fucking cocksuckers.  Yeah.  I don't understand this.  Help me out, Ann.  It says the exposure for this guy could be trouble for him since the Bin Laden mission is still classified.  Although the SEAL is retired, that doesn't mean he is clear of legal liability. 
[01:48:30]  Legal liability for killing somebody?  For killing Bin Laden?  Maybe legal liability as far as you're not supposed to talk about.  So basically, someone in this guy's camp was the ones that got the name out there.  Oh, is it?  So maybe this guy is totally okay with having his name out there.  Oh, that's a different story.  Probably all badass.  Come and get me, motherfucker.  That's what he's saying.  Come and get me.  Maybe that is the problem, because if it's classified, you're supposed to keep your mouth shut.  Yeah.  I take back what I said about the media then. 
[01:49:00]  They're upstanding people.  He was part of the pirate thing, too?  Where he fucking, he was one of them guys, huh?  That's what I'm reading.  I mean, unless I'm getting my stories mixed up.  Oh, what a cool job.  Remember that story about the pirates, the Somali pirates, and then they sniped the pirates  when the guy was right there?  Right.  Moving coach.  Yeah, apparently this guy was part of that mission, too.  Is it that guy that's pictured there?  No.  Well, that's the guy.  That's the guy.  Yeah, because that picture's in the paper.  But who's that?  That's the captain.  That was the captain who they rescued. 
[01:49:30]  Gotcha.  Wow.  Gotcha.  Damn.  But I guess since that whole thing went down, they all just said, say, we did it.  We all did it.  That's good.  Team effort.  Is that the guy?  How hard would it be if you're the guy that actually pulled the trigger to keep that info  to yourself?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'd be telling everybody.  How hard would that be?  I'd be telling everybody.  That would be my pussy move.  Right.  The fucking bar.  You like bin Laden?  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  You don't want to bang me, you fucking cunt?  How about freedom, whore?  Yeah.  You know what I did?  I want to unload into you like I unloaded into bin Laden.  See?  You didn't kill bin Laden.  Shut up.  He said he killed bin Laden.  Oh, God.  You know that you have to deal with that.  I know.  There's always one.  Who's he?  Yeah, prove it.  They wouldn't even know.  Who's bin Laden?  Kill somebody now.  You don't kill people.  Kill somebody now.  Shut up.  I remember the days.  They say you're Opie. 
[01:50:30]  Prove it.  How am I going to prove that?  Oh, my God.  I don't even go by my real name, so I don't have an ID that says Opie, so I'm fucked.  Prove it.  Prove it.  It's just like with the comedian shit.  You're not being funny.  Say something funny.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry, whore.  I'm trying to have a human connection with you.  Oh, that's funny.  Fucking pig.  It's not funny.  Let me ask this.  So this is the guy that killed bin Laden.  What does he get away with for the rest of his life?  How far does it go before finally someone goes, okay, look, you can't kill people. 
[01:51:00]  Live tax-free?  I don't know.  That'd be nice.  He just goes, look.  I don't pay no fucking taxes.  Well, let's break it down.  Speeding tickets.  He should be allowed to speed for the rest of his life, right?  Yeah.  Parking tickets.  I agree.  Get out of all parking tickets.  I mean, we even get out of that shit.  We're just doing shock jobs.  You should have one of those cards.  I killed bin Laden card.  Where you just hand it to somebody and go, yeah, I did that.  What else do you get away with?  How about a little, like, rape?  How about medium shoplifting? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, like skills.  Meaning more than just candy and stuff.  No, a little higher than that.  CDs and DVDs.  You could squeeze a T-shirt or a pair of jeans with that fucking thing still on it.  All right.  You can shoplift anything with the thing on it, but it's up to you to get the thing off.  We're not going to take the thing off for you.  He'll be good with that, though.  He's a fucking seal.  So what else can he get away with?  I don't agree that he should be able to rape it, but I do.  But no, no, no.  Kill joy?  No, I'm not.  Hold on.  I got something that I think you'll enjoy. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, okay.  I think he should be allowed ten times in his life to smack a girl in her mouth.  With complete impunity.  But it's ten times.  Because you do have to put a limit on that.  Yeah.  Or the guy would just be walking around smacking everything.  Yeah, he gets one of those cards they give you at Subway, where they fucking check it  off every time he does it.  I always wonder about this shit, because we've got some real heroes, and then they come back  to America.  They've got to get something for that.  Yeah.  Because the government certainly doesn't take care of most of those guys.  He should be allowed to piss in public any fucking time he wants. 
[01:52:30]  Take out wherever he wants.  Nice.  Where at White House lawn, he can pee if he feels like it.  Date rape?  Who's that out there on my lawn?  Oh, it's the Navy SEAL guy.  That's fine.  What about legitimate rape?  Is he allowed to do legitimate rape?  Date rape?  Any other kind?  Or is rape off the table for a guy that killed Bin Laden?  Rapes off the table, but he gets ten smacks in the mouth.  Right.  Can he push his boner into a lady on the subway?  Oh, yeah.  That's our question.  Pushing boner.  I think he should be able to lightly rub against the girl. 
[01:53:00]  on the subway until he comes in his pants.  Like a laugh dance.  But he can't make it known that he just made cumzies.  Yeah.  No cumzies faces?  No cumzies.  No face, but he can't say it.  Yeah.  He can make a...  He can go, oh, like that.  Oh, God.  What about an electric bill?  Does he have to pay his electric bill still?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the electric company ain't going to fucking give him a pass on that.  But where is he getting his money from? 
[01:53:30]  Does he have to actually work?  Free cable, though?  Yeah, free cable and all the premiums.  At least the military channels were free.  Well, yeah.  What are the military channels?  All those good channels where they show fucking...  Military channel.  You know, aircraft.  What?  Aircraft of the United States Air Force.  Like history channel?  Yeah.  Okay.  History isn't even history anymore.  Well...  I don't know what history is that.  There's a whole...  There's like thousands of channels.  There's actually something called the military channel.  The military channel.  All right.  And there's a few of them, yeah.  Those channels kill me because they, like...  It's impossible to keep up 24 hours of the same type of program all year. 
[01:54:00]  So it's like you turn to, like, the learning channel and they're like, now the grumpy old  men on the learning channel.  The learning channel has turned into another thing, too.  TLC now has, like, all those shows on now.  They have a lot of original programming.  Honey Boo Boo.  Honey Boo Boo.  I love the Honey Boo Boo.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is Honey Boo Boo?  I'm a big fan of Honey Boo Boo.  It's some reject of Toddlers and Tiaras and her family.  She didn't quite make it on Toddlers and Tiaras because she wasn't, you know, hot enough.  She's a little fat kid.  She's a little fat kid. 
[01:54:30]  But she has a great personality and, dare I say, the mom has a pretty damn good personality,  too.  But they are as white trash as...  This is the most white trash fucking family and they made a show about...  Oh, my God.  It's so gross.  People are like, you're going to hate Honey Boo Boo and guess what?  I don't hate it.  Wow.  You're not hating on Honey Boo Boo?  I'm not hating on the Honey Boo Boo.  Wasn't that stupid fucking...  Who was the couple that had the eight kids?  Yeah.  I hate that.  They're up to nine and counting.  John and Kate.  John and Kate.  Weren't they on the learning channel?  Oh, I thought you meant the other one.  I think they were, yeah.  They were, right? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Well, nine and counting is the other one.  What channel we were talking about?  Or 13 and counting?  What number?  I have no idea, but they're counting.  We were talking about Big Ange in the green room.  What channel is she on?  Who's that one?  God, nobody knows who she is.  I didn't even know until like a week ago who she was.  Never mind.  It'll take...  Can you pull up...  Can you show them Big Ange?  Yeah, I don't even know who's Big Ange.  Wait, does he get a Honey Boo Boo clip, though?  And what about the military thing?  Because I'm not done with that. 
[01:55:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Did I just...  No, it's fine, though.  In the end, it all comes together.  That's what I love about doing this.  What is that?  Huh?  That's Big Ange.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is Big Ange?  What is this on?  VH1?  Roland watches.  Get it down here.  What the fuck is this?  It's Big Ange.  Roland's got her book down there.  What does she do?  She's fucking disgusting.  What's the show about?  This big fucking...  Oh, here's best episode.  The best moments of episode six.  All right.  Let's see some best moments of episode six.  I said Roland get down here.  He's actually walking the other way. 
[01:56:00]  AJ got arrested.  Listen to her voice.  They say, allegedly, that he was selling drugs.  I don't know.  Right now, my son is in Rikers Island.  Rikers Island's like a hellhole.  Is this woman retarded?  Is it a woman?  Yeah, it's a woman.  Yeah, I know.  When I first saw her, too, I thought it was a train.  No, it's an actual woman, but she's been so plasticed out that you can't tell her.  Wait, is she part of Mob Wives and it's a spinoff?  Dude, I don't know, man.  Those lips are crazy.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Look at her tits.  She's the ugliest thing I think I'm going to say.  That is fucking heinous.  Look at the dog fucking...  I guess he's got itchy balls.  Itching his balls on the carpet.  She's saying her son's in jail and they got to fucking die.  But that's the voice we all do.  She is one of the Mob Wives, apparently.  Okay, yeah.  We've had her in, right?  No.  Oh, we didn't have this one in?  What a fucking slob.  She's a Mob Wive.  Look at that fucking mouth.  Who gives a shit? 
[01:57:00]  What's going on with you?  She has a bar in Staten Island.  What?  Of course she does.  She's got a what?  A bar in Staten Island.  One of the things she says in her book, she gives party tips.  You read her book?  No, no.  I was looking at it when I was in the office.  She gives party tips.  And one of the things she says is she's like, always have hot guys around.  And it's like, it's like, gay, straight, friends, cousins, who cares?  Just have...  It's like, ew.  Yeah, look at that fucking thing.  You would swear that's a tranny.  The picture Danny pulled up. 
[01:57:30]  I would.  I would.  She literally looks like her lips were stung by bees.  The lips are like bizarre, like special effects weird.  That lip thing is the weirdest weird.  She looks like...  Girls, knock it off of your dumb fucking lips already, girls.  But I know what that's about.  I bet you the first time you get the injections, it makes them look a little better.  But then they can't stop.  I bet not.  Yeah, because they keep going.  It looks terrible.  She looks like fucking, why so serious?  The Joker.  Let's put a smile on that face. 
[01:58:00]  You know what she looks like?  She does look like the Joker, but she doesn't look like the Heath Ledger Joker.  She looks like the Jack Nicholson Joker when he had to put the regular skin color makeup on.  That's what she looks like.  Yes.  Because he still had that big cheek-to-cheek smile.  Big dumb smile.  Yeah, cover the paint up.  You want to get nuts?  Come on, come on.  Let's get nuts.  What a mess this fucking disaster is.  So was she on Mob Wives?  Yeah.  But we didn't have her in? 
[01:58:30]  No, she does all her interviews separately from the other gals.  Why?  Because she thinks she's the biggest one.  Well, she is if they gave her the spinoff.  Yeah.  She's fucking disgusting.  Oh my God.  That's so funny.  I'm not sure.  Well, it's kind of important.  It depends how badly we're going to have to.  I'm sorry, what did you ask?  Who is she married to?  I got too excited that Danny's trying to find a picture of a regular color Joker.  Yes.  Regular makeup color Joker.  But you got to do the side by side.  She's the niece of Salvador, Sally Dogs, Lombardi? 
[01:59:00]  What?  I don't know.  What did he do?  I don't know.  The mob now, it's like...  I ain't saying shit about the mob.  No, I'm not going to make fun of it.  That's Joe Rosa.  Fuck that shit.  I wasn't going to say anything bad.  I'm just saying it's not as known as it used to be publicly.  You know what I mean?  That's why it's a problem.  You know?  Yeah.  It was like Gotti was like a celebrity when he was...  He was...  Oh, he was the dapper...  There he is.  Hang on.  His regular makeup face. 
[01:59:30]  The side by side.  Oh, shit.  I caddied for her...  What?  Oh, Jesus.  I got it.  I'm almost positive.  I caddied for her...  She's the niece.  Yeah?  I recognize this name.  She's a fucking disaster.  I got it.  Holy fuck.  I think I know...  I think I know the connection.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I got to ask her.  For real? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Dice, would you bang her?  I wouldn't bang her with your dick.  She could get a lot of goo on those lips, though.  A lot of goo, you fucking pig.  Are you crazy?  Look at her.  She's an animal.  Take your cock, your balls, your hope.  What do they call that?  A pubescent region?  All in her fucking mouth.  Until you shoot hot cum. 
[02:00:30]  Googe.  Googe.  Googe.  Can we get Big Ang on the show?  Oh, my God.  Can we get the Big Ang?  Big Ang.  I'm a few honers.  She'll be here next month.  I don't know if you want her.  I was just...  I'm scared to make fun of her now that I know she's a mob wife.  Now I'm scared to make fun of her.  If she's on TV, you know, what are they going to do?  Her son's in Rikers.  That means this mob shit is still going on.  Rikers.  I don't think they get satellite radio in Rikers.  How did it ever... 
[02:01:00]  How did we get to a place where there was able to be reality TV shows about the mob?  Thank you.  What the fuck is going on?  The mob, tow truck companies that are all fake, pawn shops, fucking people that open storage  lockers to buy shit, it's retarded.  Don't forget about Honey Boo Boo.  Honey Boo Boo.  Oh, yeah.  Can we go back to Honey Boo Boo?  No, this is too much fun.  Are you still trying to match up the picture?  That fucking...  She is a disaster.  Did you ever dance with the devil in the pale blue world? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, she's so terrible.  It's just...  I'm fascinated with her ugliness.  Like, it's so disgusting.  She would say she's not ugly.  She would say she's beautiful.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know that.  Of course she would.  She's a diva.  She's a diva.  Oh, everybody's a fucking diva now.  You know when diva jumped the shark when Elton...  When they made Elton John one of the divas?  Elton was a diva.  Now don't be hatin'. 
[02:02:00]  He was a diva?  Yeah, on that divas show.  We...  Yeah.  When they did the celebrity diva show, they did, like, the diva honors, which is, like...  Each one.  It's, like, the worst thing you could ever honor is the concept of a diva.  But anyway, yeah, the second year they did it, Elton John was one of the divas.  It's, like, oh, for Christ's sake.  Elton, a diva.  Me and Bobby Kelly saw him speak at the Tribeca Film Festival, because they did a documentary  about him.  Yeah.  Scorsese did a documentary about Elton John.  And, uh, you know, he's up there talking, and he's wearing this suit, and he looked really 
[02:02:30]  fucking slick.  Yeah.  And I was like...  I'm like, I...  Like, I would never know this dude was gay in a million years.  He looks fucking...  He looks super suave.  Like, I'm not...  I'm saying you can't be gay and suave.  I'm just saying, like, he looked like Mad Men fucking slick.  Like, he looked really manly.  And I was like, all right, I wouldn't know he was gay.  And then he walked away from the podium.  He literally was wearing bedazzled shoes.  He had to do something.  They looked like the ruby slippers from Wizard of Oz. 
[02:03:00]  I'm not exaggerating.  Yeah, you're like, there it is.  Bedazzled.  Like my dice jacket.  I could bedazzle her lips with my banana juice.  Gouge.  Gouge.  Gouge.  Fucking dice.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, this is dice for the bedazzler.  You like to see him do that fucking infomercial?  Bedazzle your pants. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, you asshole.  Bedazzle a t-shirt.  Put fucking dice rules on it.  And then on the back, put fucking face down, ass up.  Spell Gouge.  In like rhinestones and diamonds and shit.  Oh, your friends are gonna love your bedazzler.  Come on.  Order now, you fucking cunt.  How do you spell? 
[02:04:00]  Dude.  You get extra bedazzled gems, but you gotta pay separate shipping and handling, you cocksucker.  Holy shit.  When I, when I, sometimes when I text Dan about something, like, I started writing like a parentheses,  like, dice voice, and that's the hardest part of sitting there going, how do you spell  a gouge?  A gouge. 
[02:04:30]  Well, yeah, when we text back and forth, we read the text in dice voice.  Like, where are the pigs tonight?  You know where I could go out, maybe find a slob to just fuck in the ass and ditch?  You know, a nice classy night out.  Oh, fuck, man.  That's one of my favorite dice jokes, what we were talking about earlier, when somebody 
[02:05:00]  goes, prove it that you're Anthony, or prove it that you're Opie in the bar, whatever.  When he's talking about that chick blowing him in the bathroom, and she goes, my friends  will never believe that I met you.  And he goes, hey, gosh, there's your fucking receipt.  Your receipt.  What an idiot.  A lovable idiot.  I love him.  Be dazzling your shoes.  Be dazzling your socks.  Be dazzling your yam bag. 
[02:05:30]  Look at that horrible picture of dice.  You see the one with the sweater in the upper left corner?  A little higher.  Oh, God damn.  All the way over.  Oh, not that one?  No, all the way over is one worse.  Yeah, that one's pretty bad.  That's bad, too, but.  It's that one all the way to the left.  Oh, my God.  Second one down.  Yeah.  Look at this.  It's his big fucking Christmas sweater.  Did you see the file name?  What the name of the file name?  What is it?  It was ADC underscore dork. 
[02:06:00]  He's wearing like a Christmas sweater with giant glasses.  He's got the fucking Ace Rothstein glasses on.  And he's got that like monkey hair.  Dude, I'm not exaggerating.  Are you talking about like a newborn monkey?  Newborn orangutan hair.  He has orangutan hair.  That one you can.  Holy shit.  Yeah, could you do a split screen of that for me, please?  That one I think you can do.  Oh, that's funny.  It's when it's not slicked back.  It looks kind of like a newborn orangutan. 
[02:06:30]  Orangutan.  That's so funny.  It's orangutan, right?  I always said orangutan.  It's orangutan.  He's got hair like a monkey.  Oh, man.  That's.  Oh, that is adorable, though.  Jesus Christ.  Would you buy one for your compound?  I'm a monkey.  That is pretty fucking cute.  Jesus Christ.  Rolling left.  Are we going to get Big Ange on the show?  And Joe, you got to come back for the Big Ange interview.  Oh, I would love to come back for that. 
[02:07:00]  Now, would you guys.  I think I knew her uncle for real.  Yeah, I'm.  It's either the same guy or a very similar name.  Roland.  I'm freaked out.  You want her?  I don't know.  She's scary.  She's booked already.  With us?  No.  If you want her, I'll get it.  She's coming September.  I would take her.  Yeah, the Big Ange.  That voice alone on the radio has got to be great.  Can we get the Honey Boo Boo cast?  Oh, God. 
[02:07:30]  How nice.  Wow.  Danny is finding some great dice picks.  Oh, God, man.  Yeah, I need a treadmill.  What do you want from me?  Now he's fighting.  Like old dice.  Oh, sorry.  No, I was just going to say, he doesn't look like that anymore.  I'm just kidding.  No, he's in shape now.  Oh, he's in shape again?  Yeah, yeah.  He got back in shape.  Dude, he's smaller than you.  I saw him at the Riviera.  He's fucking.  He's tiny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He lost, I don't know, 80 pounds, I would say.  For the movie, probably.  There, look.  There's a recent picture of him.  It's me.  Can you believe that?  Same guy.  Oh, thank God, man. 
[02:08:00]  Because it was starting to look like when you put Henry Winkler next to Fonzie, and you're  like, oh, God.  You know?  Like, it's, that's fucking, that's great that he's, all right.  I wish he would just stop.  That's with the sunglasses.  He's like, what's that?  He's 50?  He's got to be 50.  He's in his 50s.  53?  I wish he would dress like an old, like wear the open collar suit.  Like, dress like the old.  I'm in leather.  I always wore leather.  Yeah.  And my new big glasses. 
[02:08:30]  What's?  He's got a lot of beautiful ears.  If I crack a lens, I gotta call safe flight repair.  It's a windshield.  And gaze.  He's gonna be in a Woody Allen movie, man.  He's doing something right.  I know, man.  And he's taping a special in Chicago this weekend.  Yeah.  Who's he gonna do a special?  Remember we were invited, remember?  Ah, right.  Remember how we were all invited and never heard another thing about it?  Oh, boy.  He's doing a new special? 
[02:09:00]  This weekend.  I heard his new material is great.  We went, I was fucking laughing my ass off.  We all would, we were having dinner one night, and Rogan said like, oh, yeah, Dice is playing  at the Riviera.  And we're like, let's go.  So we just went and fucking laughing our asses off.  And Jimmy's like, he's laughing really hard.  I look over and Jimmy just goes, he's just a fucking pig.  It's being, it's exactly what Dice is being.  It's exactly what you want Dice to be when you go.  I wasn't disappointed. 
[02:09:30]  He didn't try to change his act.  You know, it's all new stuff.  But it's, it's the same Dice, you know?  Oh, that's great.  I love it.  It's fucking great.  I love it.  I'm a pirate.  I got an eye.  He dares to get your eye patch, you faggot.  Why is he wearing an eye patch?  My eye hurt.  I had some glaucoma or something.  I got floaters.  I don't know.  Look, it's over there. 
[02:10:00]  Now it's over here now.  I had a floater in my eye.  I'm looking at the floater.  It's over here.  But I try to look at the floater and it's over here now.  I can't, I can't focus on the floater.  It's like a little thing in my eye that's always out of reach of the fucking pupil or  something.  Oh, look, there's my floater.  No, it's gone.  It's over here. 
[02:10:30]  I fucking love it.  I love it so much.  Jesus Christ.  I have to take you doing that impression.  Because it's literally the point where I try to do an impression, your impression for  myself in the shower just to make myself laugh.  Just to make yourself chuckle.  I got to just get a tape of you on my phone so I could just get a fix of it when I need  it.  Let me tell you about astigmatisms. 
[02:11:00]  E-C-D-B-F.  Something over there.  Another letter sideways.  What do you want from me?  You know he fudges the eye exam.  You know he does.  I'm not taking my sunglasses off for this.  Turn the lights on.  Dice, tell me when this dot is exactly over this dot.  He's right there.  No, it's not.  It's not. 
[02:11:30]  Don't tell me.  I'm the one looking.  Jacob.  Hey, Jacob, doctor.  Hey, don't get so close with your face.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ.  I fucking...  He's got his eye patch on.  And he's doing the dice cigarette over his head move.  Come on.  Take a picture.  You know he's not wearing it for any reason.  You think he just went...  That's nice.  I want to wear an eye patch. 
[02:12:00]  I'm not going to wear an eye patch for a while.  People will wonder.  I don't want to be a pirate.  They'll start talking.  It's like...  There's no way there's anything wrong with this.  I've asked, matey.  Hey, shiver me fucking timbers, you asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of cum in your face, you fucking faggotito.  Yeah.  Hey, turn it broadside, and we'll hammer him with cannonballs. 
[02:12:30]  Boy, goosh, goosh.  Yeah, I got a peg leg in my pants.  Fuck, man.  I'm fucking sweating.  You're making me sweat.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, let's bury our treasure after I bury my cock in your pussy.  You fucking whore. 
[02:13:00]  Fucking dice pirate.  You dice pirate.  All right, you just suck my cock, or you walk in the plane.  That's all there is to it.  That's all there is to it.  Oh, fuck.  This wife is hot, man.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me. 
[02:13:30]  Fucking great.  How old is his wife?  You guys know?  She's fucking smoker.  Younger than her.  Yeah, she's a very attractive woman.  A Latino woman.  Latina.  She's been in the studio.  Latina?  Latino?  Does he do material about his wife?  He was doing fucking material with his wife, but with his ex-wife.  His ex-wife came out into the front of the stage and starts yelling at Dice. 
[02:14:00]  Dice starts yelling at her.  No.  His ex-wife does like his merch.  Oh, it was like a...  No!  Yes.  Wait, not...  Yes.  Not one he hates.  It wouldn't be one he hates.  It's...  Eleanor?  Yeah.  He was never really married to her.  Oh, well, you know what I mean.  Well, Eleanor scared me because he was married.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Not that one.  The woman he had the kids with.  I'm like, there's no way that would happen.  Eleanor's really cool, man.  She's sweet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She opens for Dice.  Yeah.  They all hang out still.  It was...  Only Dice can make that happen. 
[02:14:30]  No shit, right?  He has his ex-girlfriend, tours with him, with his wife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they all get along.  I bring people together.  So what does she do?  They do like a planted...  Yeah, she comes out.  Well, he goes, where's my something?  He's asking her for something.  He goes, Eleanor, where are you?  Bring it to me.  And she brings it up and starts giving him shit, and they go back and forth a little bit.  It's fucking...  It's funny.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, it worked.  Because it's Dice.  Yeah, I got you. 
[02:15:00]  It works because it's Dice.  It's like a Dice Honeymooners kind of thing?  Yes.  Yeah.  Mom, fucking Ralph Cramden.  How about I cram it in your cunt?  I was just going to say that.  My cunt crammed in your cunt.  Hey, Norton.  Get down here.  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. Marshall.  Fuck you.  I ain't driving your bus no more.  Oh, fuck.  Look, dude.  She is smoking, man. 
[02:15:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He definitely is out of his league.  Good for him.  Yeah.  That'll just end horribly.  At some point.  Right.  Was she a model?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We don't know the...  Very attractive.  Yeah.  We don't know the details, really.  Attractive, yes.  I got to settle.  I want to settle down, man.  Well, settle down.  Are you dating, Joe?  Find yourself a nice girl.  Are you dating?  Look at Henry.  He's settling down.  Found himself a nice girl. 
[02:16:00]  What's that from?  Goodfellas?  Yeah.  Who says that?  I don't remember that.  The mother.  Fucking Pesci's mother.  Oh.  He went at the wedding.  Look at Henry.  He's settling down.  He's found himself a nice girl.  There you are.  I say the Pesci line from that to my mom all the time when she goes, when are you going  to meet a nice girl?  Yeah, yeah.  I meet a nice girl every night.  I settle down in the morning.  I wake up again.  I want to be with you.  I want to be with you.  Yeah, I'm dating, but you know, it's nothing serious.  That's not working out.  So how are you going to settle down?  I got to meet the right girl. 
[02:16:30]  Well, yeah, that's part of it.  Huh?  It is part of it.  The right girl.  The right girl.  Who is the right girl for Joe DeRosa?  The right girl for Joe DeRosa doesn't exist.  As does the right girl for me.  Does the right girl for Joe DeRosa need a penis?  No, no.  I don't think so.  You know, sometimes I wonder.  Bailey.  Wow.  Sometimes I wonder.  We all know you like the Bailey J.  I was in a cab with this comic, Nikki Glaser, the other night. 
[02:17:00]  I know Nikki.  She's really funny, and she's sweet.  And I'm in a cab with her.  I spilled my coffee on myself.  You fucking bitch.  Yeah, and I go, ow.  And she goes, you fucking pussy.  Oh, God.  Right?  And I go, I'm either gay or Jewish.  It's one or the other.  But, like, something's in there that hasn't come out yet.  Yeah.  Like, it's coming out soon.  Was the coffee that hot?  No, it wasn't that hot at all.  I'm just a fucking pussy.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah, I'm a fucking pussy. 
[02:17:30]  I'm such a pussy.  I don't know.  I got to meet the...  I don't know.  I got to meet her.  I don't know.  You know, fucking...  I just want to live...  I live in a fantasy world.  I want to live, like, old school.  That movie, Old School, for the rest of my life.  Like, I want to live in a house with my buddies...  Yeah.  ...until I die, and, like...  Right, right.  You know, have a wife that lets me fucking live there, and she's around what I want her  to be.  You know, it's so...  I got to get a realistic grasp on what this whole thing is.  I hear ya.  That's exactly what I like.  I just like my own fucking thing. 
[02:18:00]  I don't like having to fucking compromise very much with a young lady.  Yeah, but you got...  You got to that point after a marriage.  Oh, yeah.  I've never...  The longest relationship I've ever had was eight months.  I mean, you know, I've never...  That's the longest?  That's it?  By, and by, like, a, like...  How, how, how much of it was really good?  Usually, none of it.  I mean, the whole thing was really miserable. 
[02:18:30]  No matter how long you've been with a girl, it's always half.  Huh?  It's always half.  Half?  Yeah, so four and a half months.  Oh, man.  And when I tell you, it was, it was like, I mean, all I wanted to do was fuck anything  else that I could...  I mean, it was like, there wasn't a moment of, ah, it's worth it.  I could be with this woman.  Not a fucking minute of it, man.  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, like, literally, like, I felt like I needed to be strapped down to something.  Yeah, when you're with a girl where all you want to do is fuck other girls, wow.  That's usually a bad sign.  There's a relationship problem there.  Dude, I fucked whatever I could until the last second.  Until I was absolutely not allowed to fuck anything else anymore.  Like, to the point where I'd bring girls, I was, when I was just seeing her, I would  bring girls that I was fucking to, like, meet her. 
[02:19:30]  You're the worst.  And just act like I was friends with them.  You're exactly as bad as I was with that shit.  Really?  You did that?  I would do things, you know.  Here's what I did.  I was actually in a relationship, albeit at the very beginnings of a relationship, and  this should just say, it's not going to fucking last.  And I took another girl to that fucking Paul McCartney concert at the Apollo.  And the press took pictures of it, and it ended up on Getty Images.  It wasn't even like I hid it. 
[02:20:00]  And it just showed up everywhere.  And she's like, what is this?  She goes, you said you only had one ticket.  And then I'm just lying.  I was like, no, I just gave it to somebody out in front.  Like this chick's waiting in a gown for a spare ticket.  Why would she buy that?  She didn't.  Yeah, but she was with you for a while after that.  No, she didn't buy it, but she didn't leave.  That's pretty much it.  She had a lot of ammo on me as far as me fucking up.  She taught me some of the best fucking shit, though, that I need to do as far as chicks 
[02:20:30]  snooping, how to defend against it.  Because I'm talking about Melissa.  She could fucking find anything.  I was constantly at odds.  Do you know what it's like to be having a good day?  You're just brushing your teeth, looking in the mirror.  And then you see in the mirror a figure just comes through the door.  He goes, you fucking asshole, and wings the phone at your head.  Jesus Christ.  And then you just got there with a toothbrush in your mouth going, oh, fuck. 
[02:21:00]  And now the Rolodex of fucking deceit is just spinning in your head.  It's literally like.  But some would say you did that to yourself, though.  Oh, I don't deny that.  Okay.  You're right.  But let me tell you something.  When she's throwing a fucking phone at your head.  Right.  And you were just like, I'm just getting sleepies out of my eyes.  I'm brushing.  I'm looking.  I'm just like, ah.  You fucking asshole.  Let me ask one question. 
[02:21:30]  I'm like, oh, no.  What did she find?  Let me ask one question.  Yes.  Why did you play it both ways, then?  You obviously want to be single, but you had a girl in the house.  I wanted to fuck.  I understand.  Is Joe?  Yep.  Can I understand this?  I understand.  I know what you're saying, though.  No, I understand.  I understand some relationships.  There is a gray area between the two.  But if you want to be single, why not just be single?  Because let me tell you something.  Why do both?  Because that seems like a horrible way to go through a day. 
[02:22:00]  When she put a fucking nice little black dress on and we went out, that was fucking the shit.  She looked great.  You know?  Yeah, she was.  Like that.  And that kind of whole thing where she was dressed up and the makeup's on and everything.  And I'm just walking around like, yeah, this is great.  But I'd rather fuck me some white trash.  Well, you know, Michigan.  I guess she was white trash.  But I'd rather like, to me, that was like.  What is it about white trash?  It always.  It's my downfall.  It's my kryptonite.  But you didn't have problems getting girls. 
[02:22:30]  What?  You didn't have problems getting girls.  Yeah, but you know.  So why have one just kind of waiting around?  She's fucking pretty good arm candy.  You know what?  I know exactly what you're saying.  Like, I always have said, like, you know, you got to man up in one direction or the other.  Either you.  Eventually.  I'm realistic.  I get it that you live this life where it's in between a little bit.  But eventually you got to man up is what I'm getting at.  I never got it until this.  This is the moment when I understood.  Finally, I was like, oh, this is why guys keep girlfriends and still cheat. 
[02:23:00]  This was just my moment.  I'm not saying everybody does this.  My buddy had a bachelor party and we went up to this spot.  They shut this spot down for us.  This club.  We had the whole club to ourselves.  And these strippers came in and they started out real slow and they were barely doing anything.  Then all of a sudden they're fucking eating each other out on the floor and it's just fucking chaos.  Then all of a sudden they're going, who wants to go downstairs, you know, into the bathroom? 
[02:23:30]  And, you know, I got two blowjobs that night from two different hookers.  I was out of my fucking mind.  I was drinking.  We're doing drugs.  I was fucking out of my mind.  I get two different.  I was clean about it.  I wore the condoms for the blowjobs.  I got blowjobs from two different hookers in the bathroom of this place.  Wow.  And I had a girlfriend at the time and I left and it was 7 a.m. when I got home and I called  my girlfriend and I was like, can you please come over, please? 
[02:24:00]  Like I felt, I was so depressed and I felt so gross and I was like, I need to have something  pure in my life right now.  And it was a scumbag movie.  That was the first time I understood like, oh, this is why guys have a girlfriend and  then they keep around after they cheat because there's this thing about it, I think, where  you feel bad a little bit and you feel like it was, you're like, I'm not going to do that  again.  Saturdays were for the wives.  But Friday. 
[02:24:30]  You know what I mean now?  I don't know.  Maybe, I don't know.  That just made me theorize that that's why guys sometimes do that.  But I don't, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's, I really, I, despite that, you know, I'm a co-author of a fucking book about  cheating that's about to come out.  Yeah, that's true.  That book's not out yet?  I've put it behind me.  No, October 2nd.  It's good to read.  I read a lot of it.  Thank you.  You guys did a really good job on that.  Well, you guys are both out there. 
[02:25:00]  I thought it was out already.  Huh?  Dominantly featured.  Yeah, you guys are right in there.  I got cheating stories in there.  Yeah, we both gave you a story.  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah.  Some nice stories.  Some nice stories.  Hilarious fucking stories.  I've never been good at cheating.  I'll tell you that much.  I've never been good.  I've never had a game when it comes to cheating.  I'm terrible.  I throw caution to the wind for some new fucking box, and everyone knows it.  You really are just like the bad guy on the heist when it comes to cheating. 
[02:25:30]  He just runs in fucking headfirst shooting at people.  Shooting.  What'd you do that for?  Fucking.  Oh, he fucking moved.  Yeah, like Mr. Who's the crazy one at Reservoir Dulles?  Mr. White.  Mr. White?  No.  Blonde.  Mr. Blonde.  The Paul McCartney show.  Mr. Blonde.  You stopped to get your picture taken.  I like snuck through like the side door.  Dude, I walked the carpet.  When you're cheating with another girl.  You probably shouldn't walk through Paul McCartney.  Oh, those commonplace Paul McCartney concerts. 
[02:26:00]  Don't walk the red carpet and be photographed by the paparazzi.  Yeah, there she is.  There's a picture.  And that's just Googling your name.  Just my name.  Just your name.  Oh, she comes up.  Wow.  Oh, I like that.  That was fucking Lexi.  Who was she?  Lexi.  Lexi was really...  She was very cool and very cute.  What happened to her?  I got an email that said that we shouldn't be seeing each other anymore. 
[02:26:30]  And it was from her boyfriend.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess our boyfriend and my girlfriend should have had a little chit chat.  Jesus Christ.  Just a couple of dirt balls going to see Paul McCartney together.  A couple of fucking assholes, right?  We're just there fucking...  Like we're a power couple.  And we're both trying to keep it on the QT in front of the press.  Jesus Christ, Dan.  I mean, you got the loudest tie on earth on it. 
[02:27:00]  Dude, I am a fucking idiot right there.  I didn't even try.  You walked the red carpet, Joe.  My chick was in California at the time.  So outrageous.  She was in California at the time.  And I'm just like, yep.  Let's go.  She can't look at the internet when she's in another state.  I'll get away with this.  The internet doesn't go to California, does it?  Does the New York internet show up in California?  I don't think it does.  I don't think it does.  I'm terrible at cheating.  That's why if any girl thinks I'm cheating... 
[02:27:30]  Odds are you are?  No, I'm not.  Because you'll know I'm cheating.  Oh, oh, oh.  You'll know it.  I'm horrible at it.  Don't you get pissed off at girls that, like, they get pissed off at you for being a dog,  but meanwhile, you met them while you were being a dog.  And then they go, oh, I can't believe that you did it to me.  It's just like, well, that's how I fucking met you.  Look at me.  It's like the fucking, uh, the frog riding on the back of the fucking, uh, alligator  out over to the river. 
[02:28:00]  And he goes, you promise you won't eat me?  And the alligator keeps saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he goes, ah, why are you eating me?  He goes, because I'm an alligator.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, right.  Fucking guy.  Something like that.  Well, it might have been a possum and a crow.  It's more so the fact, like, because then the girl will go, like, oh, how could you do  this to me or whatever?  And it's just like, what do you mean?  How could I do it to you?  I, you, you knew.  I'd go into everybody.  You knew.  You knew coming on this train where it was going.  Oh, man, look at that.  Dude, let me see that picture where I fucking hit the bottom of the pool.  It's all the way to the right. 
[02:28:30]  Jesus Christ, man.  What the fuck?  That's when I dove out of my jacuzzi into the pool, and I, I was, I dove into the shallower  end and just smacked my head and nose on the bottom of the pool.  By the way, how drunk were you that you forgot which end was the shallower end?  In your own pool.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe I jumped from the pool into the jacuzzi.  Maybe that was the problem.  Well, personally, this was the funniest thing for me, because just like the previous week,  I had pretty much done the exact same thing and ate my ass on the air about it before  being a jerk and jumping into the pool. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, that's right.  And it felt so good.  So good.  I came in that morning like, what happened?  I'm fucking jumping in the pool.  I heard about vindication.  There you go.  Yeah.  It does look like the cover with fucking Lance Armstrong.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that was bad.  That was a good one.  All right, listen, Jota Rose, what are we promoting?  Are you just hanging?

[02:31:30]  Manning.  I dropped my phone.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You like the UFC, Joe?  I appreciate it, but I don't watch it.  It was a big story yesterday.  I'm trying to figure out who's right and who's wrong.  Oh, Kevin Smith's calling in, though, right?  Is that Kevin?  Oh.  Oh, we're going to...  Kevin Smith.  Good morning.  Good morning, Kevin Smith.  Kevin.  How are you?  How are you, guys? 
[02:32:00]  Hey, were they playing Clerks in Central Park yesterday?  That's why I'm calling in.  It's happening on Sunday.  Oh, Sunday.  Because I do a lot of biking and I bike...  Oh, wait.  I'm bad.  My bad.  It's Saturday night.  Oh, man.  Because I was biking...  Two things that I'm going to tell you.  What about the bike?  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  I was just biking around and I saw where they're going to have the festival.  That's pretty cool.  They're doing a quick little mini movie festival in Central Park.  And I knew Kevin Smith had...  Every summer they do this festival in the park and then they do this voting online to 
[02:32:30]  let you pick the last movie.  And this year it was clerks were coming to America.  And so the folks voted up clerks and, ba-ding, clerks get to play.  It's a Saturday night in Central Park.  I think it's in the Sheeps.  It's called Sheeps Meadow.  Yeah.  And Brian O'Hallander played Dante.  He's going to get up, introduce it, and do Q&A and stuff.  Oh.  Unfortunately, I'm going to be in Ottawa on stage, so I won't be there.  Oh, you won't be able to make it? 
[02:33:00]  It's pretty cool.  It's close to Sheeps Meadows.  It's a bummer, man.  Can you imagine, coming up on the 20th anniversary, and 20 years ago when we made that flick,  never in a million years did we imagine it would be exhibited at all, let alone in Central  Park.  Yeah.  So that's a very cool thing for us.  That is pretty goddamn cool.  Anybody else from the movie going to be there?  Oh, I know for a fact Brian's going.  Okay.  Jason Mewes is going to be with me.  Or maybe, actually, he's flying down to Jersey, too, so he might go there. 
[02:33:30]  We have a pretty busy weekend.  Right now I'm in Florida.  I just went to Star Wars Celebration 6, which was amazing.  What was that all about?  They do a convention every other year, the Lucasfilm and the Star Wars organization, and  essentially they throw their own Comic-Con, but just for Star Wars fans.  It's called Star Wars Celebration.  This is the sixth time they've done it, I guess, here in the States.  I think they've done it twice abroad.  So it was like a gathering 25,000, 30,000, 50,000 Star Wars fans over the last three 
[02:34:00]  days in Orlando.  Yeah, it's pretty damn neat.  And I got up to Q&A last night, you know, the normal Q&A show, but it was very Star Wars  centric, so that was a lot of fun.  What kind of cool shit was there?  Oh, they've got stuff on display on the floor.  There's people walking around at Cosplay.  I mean, if you're remotely a Star Wars fan, bring a wallet because, boy, they've got stuff  that you've never seen before.  Really?  Vendors coming from all over the country.  So it's neat, man.  It's an eyeful.  And the people are just so sweet. 
[02:34:30]  You know, talk about a bunch of Star Wars fans.  Yeah, a bunch of Star Wars geeks.  You know, they're pretty harmless.  You could come down here and dominate.  You could literally come down here and take over the con.  Yeah, yeah.  But they're soft.  I want to go to that really bad.  Yeah, that does sound like something that would be pretty fun.  Never.  It's a good time, man.  You know, like, I went up on stage last night to do the Q&A.  I got a little emotional because I was talking about the kid I used to play Star Wars with  when I was a kid.  His name was Pete King. 
[02:35:00]  He would come down from Brooklyn to New Jersey every summer.  His family had a bungalow.  So, you know, his dad worked for, I think it was the Power and Light Company in the city.  And when it came to the summertime, he just wanted to get out of there, bring his family  down to Highlands because, you know, there's a beach there in the seaside community.  So Pete King had every Star Wars figure there was and the big toys and play sets.  So he'd come down every summer and we'd sit there and play Star Wars.  And I was telling the cats last night that, like, when he was about 19, 20, you know,  when he stopped coming down, we stopped playing Star Wars around the age of 13. 
[02:35:30]  He got more into punk rock and stuff like that.  And one day he was out with his friends, stepped off a curb in Manhattan and just got slammed  by a taxi cab.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  So I went on stage.  It's not a happy story?  It's not a very happy story.  To begin the Star Wars celebration with, but I told him that and then, you know, said  it's kind of like me and Pete finally made it.  So it was a really, really nice moment.  And then, of course, lots of Mon Mothma jokes and stuff like that.  Of course.  Humor.  Every Star Wars joke I always thought was too obscure to include in a movie I was able 
[02:36:00]  to bring out last night.  Yeah, they'll get them.  Kevin, did you go to a Star Wars, the orchestra thing live when they did that?  No, no, but I heard it was fantastic where they performed the score live with the movie.  It was amazing.  Well, first of all, in the lobby of the venue, they had all, like, actual memorabilia from  the movie.  So, like, I took pictures of the actual Han Solo frozen in carbonite, like the actual  thing. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, really?  Shit like that.  And then you go in, there's an orchestra, there's a full, there's the biggest LCD screen  ever of all time or whatever behind the stage, and they play, there's a live symphony and  chorus there, and they play to the clips, but they play it perfectly timed live to the  footage.  That's awesome.  And then Anthony Daniels, C-3PO, narrates the whole thing, and he tells the story of  all six Star Wars movies over the music, and they start with the fucking 20th Century 
[02:37:00]  Fox thing, and a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and like, dude, I'm getting  chills talking about it.  I literally cried through the first, like, five minutes of it.  Through your tears.  Out of excitement.  You just were weeping openly from the music.  I get so excited at shit like that, it makes me cry.  I cried at a fucking, uh, the last Batman movie.  The scene in Dark Knight Rises when the lights go out in that garage, and that cop goes,  oh, you're in for a show tonight, kid, and you're like, Batman's coming back, he's coming 
[02:37:30]  back.  I cried from that.  Good for you, Joe.  That wasn't the moment for me.  The moment I started crying in Dark Knight was when he was flying away, spoilers, he's  flying away with the nuclear weapon, and he puts him in the bat by himself, and they're  playing that, like, you know, high-pitched kid singing, like, oh.  Oh, yeah, that.  And he's bailing out.  And I was like, you know, they cut to a shot of him flying.  And I got sad, because I was like, man, oh, man, like, they'll never cut this guy a break. 
[02:38:00]  Now he's going to be killed by a nuclear weapon.  Yeah.  As we've all seen the movie, you know, there's a bit of a different ending.  Yeah, but why can't they just have him dead?  Because it's Batman.  But, come on.  It's Batman.  Like, part of the trick of Batman is, like, he's almost invulnerable.  He's the double-sided coin of Batman.  Everyone who likes him, likes him because they see themselves in Batman.  Like, he's got no superpowers.  He's not from another planet.  He's not supernatural.  He's not a mutant.  Here's a dude who just trained really hard, and he's got access to untold wealth. 
[02:38:30]  So, because of that, he's a normal person who can become a superhero.  So, that's why people identify with Batman.  But the odd thing is, you want Batman to be as invulnerable as Superman.  Like, he's unheringly correct, always in the right place at the right time, has the right thing to say,  knows where to put his fist, where a dude is about to attack him from nowhere, his fist comes up, takes him out.  Everything about Batman has to be so incredibly calculated, where even if he's facing down the smartest person in the world,  he's like, I've already beat you 10 minutes ago, and then he explains how or something. 
[02:39:00]  So, when you see, if you're watching that movie, and you're like, you can't kill Batman, Batman can never die.  He actually gave fans the Batman ending that every Batman fan needs, which is like, oh, Batman would never die.  Like, he found a way out of that plane.  Yeah.  But that's why it would have been cool.  No, you can't kill Batman.  Yes, that's why it would have been cool.  Do you realize people will accept Jesus getting killed at the end of a movie before they'll accept Batman getting killed? 
[02:39:30]  Batman has to be more powerful than Jesus.  True.  Very true.  So, wait a second.  This Saturday, there's that Central Park screening of Clerks, totally free.  Anyone can go up to it and stuff.  Sunday, I'm going to give you a chance to come be on TV.  You know, we do that show Comic Book Men on AMC?  Yeah.  That's coming back.  I just saw the first episode of the new season.  It was fantastic.  They cut it together.  It'll be on in October.  One of the, on Sunday, we're doing a signing for that book I wrote, Tough Shit, down at the Secret Stash in Red Bank, but we're shooting the whole thing for Comic Book Men. 
[02:40:00]  So, everybody online, people coming up to the table, man, you're doing an opportunity for you to be on the actual show with us.  From 2 to 5 on Sunday, come down to Red Bank for the signing and be on Comic Book Men with us.  Yeah, and just going down to the shop is pretty goddamn cool.  You've got some great stuff down there.  It is.  You know, if you're into that stuff, you're remotely into the movie, too, maybe there's props hanging up and whatnot.  But if you're one of those people who's like, I should be on TV. 
[02:40:30]  If Fat Kim Smith's on TV and he's untalented, I, too, should be on television.  Here is your absolute chance to do it.  Sunday from 2 to 5.  Going back to something we were talking about before, man, the Star Wars thing with the live orchestra.  I saw Bugs Bunny on Broadway at the Garden State Arts Center in 1993, and it was basically the same thing.  They took all these clips from classic Warner Brothers cartoons, like Kill the Rabbit and all the very musical. 
[02:41:00]  And they have the live orchestra performing it.  It's pretty damn impressive, man.  I got it.  Go ahead.  Yeah, when you watch those old cartoons and realize that, I mean, there was an orchestra going over every little tiptoe move that the characters made.  All of those, you know, when they're running, all of them had a song behind it, and it wasn't just some stock music that they threw.  It really is amazing, the work that went into a fucking cartoon. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  I mean, that's the thing.  Like, when we watched those cartoons as kids, we thought, clearly these were made for us to entertain us in syndication on an after-school or Saturday afternoon.  Yeah.  But those were theatrical shorts meant for an audience that wasn't just primarily children.  Most of those shorts were viewed by adults.  So they poured everything into them.  You're talking about gorgeous 24-frame animation, not the limited animation stuff we were used to from Hanna-Barbera and other companies.  Oh, when it just got shitty, right?  Oh, the animation got crap. 
[02:42:00]  The background over and over again.  Or even now, you know, in the age of flash animation, like all of us can be animators.  But watching those Warner Brothers cartoons where they were doing feature animation at 24 frames a second.  I mean, every second of film contained 24 separate images to make up that second.  It's lustrous.  It looks almost real, even though it's a cartoon.  And then on top of it, they built those amazing scores.  They got full orchestras.  And it was, my God, their name, the guy's name escapes me, begins with an L. 
[02:42:30]  And composed all of that music and poured it on top of it.  And then included jokes that were aimed squarely at the older audience sitting there watching it.  And so, as we grew up, we're watching the Warner Brothers cartoons and being educated as well as being entertained.  Unfortunately, we also grew up as a generation that's like, if you've got a problem with somebody, drop an anvil on there.  I wish.  Jesus Christ.  Well, it's like that era of Tom and Jerry where, like, the Nelson Riddle years or whatever, like, you know, like, those are defined as the good Tom and Jerry years, you know? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Then they got bad.  Yeah, animation got cheap.  And there's one here, actually, that people figure the best Tom and Jerry, ironically, because most people will always be like,  Hanna-Barbera and their limited animation.  But Hanna-Barbera did the original Tom and Jerry theatrical cartoons, the ones that everyone loves, you know,  not the ones later on where they're friends, sometimes they're talking, sometimes it looks very limited to the animation.  But the ones that were made back in the 50s and 60s were made by Hanna-Barbera before they started their TV animation division. 
[02:43:30]  And that's when they figured out, like, well, we could save money doing limited animations instead of 24 frames a second.  We'll do, like, 12 or 15 frames a second.  Yeah, yeah.  But those cats who brought us, you know, a wealth of wonderful characters and all the Hanna-Barbera cartoons and stuff,  started by doing something even better looking.  And that was those original Tom and Jerry cartoons that we all did.  Even as a kid, I realized, like, the sucky animation when it was just the background, the character, 
[02:44:00]  and all that moved was the mouth when they had to talk.  Like, that, and it was just open and closed.  It was a horrible thing.  And even as a kid, I was like, eh, this isn't as good as, like, watching The Roadrunner.  Oh, that's not true.  I thought the Flintstones house was that long.  Yeah, the Flintstones.  Well, the Flintstones were fun stories.  Holy fuck, he could run.  But the animation was limited.  That was primetime animation.  The Flintstones was a show like The Simpsons.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  At nighttime. 
[02:44:30]  Remember how long that fucking house was?  Yeah.  The Flintstones house?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a long house.  But then you see it from the outside.  It was a short house.  Yeah.  They didn't give a fuck.  They didn't care.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Yeah, that's why it was so cool when Disney started to bring back the animated stuff.  Not that I don't appreciate computer animated stuff, but it's just not quite as cool as the  It never will be.  As the hand-drawn, hand-painted stuff.  It'll never be as fucking cool.  It's absolutely cool. 
[02:45:00]  No, I'm not saying it's not cool.  I'm just saying it's not quite as astounding to me to look at and go, Jesus Christ, this  is hand-painted, as Kevin said, 24 fucking frames per second.  On an artistic level.  That is insane.  And I know CG takes forever, or computer animation, excuse me, takes forever to do, but there's  something about the ... I was in here one time with that guy, Chuck, was in here promoting  that movie Tangled, and we started talking about this, and I go, you know, I go, listen,  man, I go, it's really cool that you're in this Disney movie, but I really miss those 
[02:45:30]  hand-painted, drawn ones, and he goes, no, no, this is one of those.  You're like such a fucking idiot.  Come along with that shit.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah.  What's that?  I watch a lot of animated films, because I've got a young kid, which is amazing.  One of my favorites that, you know, they've kind of, I wouldn't say stopped 2D animation,  but yes, it's predominantly the CG stuff right now, but one of Disney's last 2D animation, 
[02:46:00]  I think The Princess and the Frog were the last one they did.  But prior to that, maybe 2BAC was, I thought, one of their best, Lilo and Stitch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  2D animation, it clearly could have been CG, because it takes place in space and lends  itself to characters and whatnot, and renditions in the CG world, but their 2D animation of  that was so wonderful and so beautiful, it popped into life almost like it is a Pixar flick.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember going to see that one, and I don't even have a child. 
[02:46:30]  Who's that creepy dude over there?  Yeah, exactly.  It's just me.  Yeah.  You find yourself in the middle of a Catch a Predator episode.  So this gentleman wants to see Lilo and Stitch.  Lilo and Stitch, Anthony, why don't you just take a seat, leave the popcorn right over there?  Yeah.  We've got a plate of cookies over here for you, Ant.  You brought Zima and condoms.  Hey, Kevin, were you happy with Batman overall? 
[02:47:00]  Which one?  Batman?  Yeah, the last one.  You know, I'm a big Batman fan, so I did two podcasts.  I started on, we do a podcast now called Fat Man on Batman, where that's all I talk about  is various aspects of Batman.  I've had a lot of people from the cartoon on recently.  But I started there with a review, and then we continued the review over on the next episode  of Smodcast.  It was a three-hour podcast.  I'm not even lying.  I'm a little ashamed to say it.  But the second episode is literally me telling my friend Scott Mosher the entire movie from 
[02:47:30]  end to end, and with almost insane stoner-like detail.  Having seen it only three times at that point, I literally reiterate the entire movie to Scott.  He still hasn't seen it.  He's like, there's no point in seeing it.  What you told me is so much better than anything I could ever see.  How many times have you seen it now?  I saw it three on opening week, and I saw it Thursday night before the troubles happened  in Colorado.  I saw it the next day on Friday with my wife when we were doing the show Spoilers, and 
[02:48:00]  she wasn't even going to go, but she got real indignant about the Colorado thing, and she's  like, fuck terrorism.  We're going to the movies, even though she didn't want to go.  I thought that was kind of brave.  And then on the next day, I took my kid to go see it.  So I saw it all three.  I saw it on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday on opening weekend.  I liked it quite a bit.  There's definitely some plot holes or some stuff that I was like, man, are they going to  tell us one more time that the autopilot doesn't work?  There's little stuff like that.  And the fact that Bane is an incredible badass who gets taken out by Catwoman and a gun at 
[02:48:30]  the end of the movie, and that man never really gets to beat him.  But other than that, I thought they did some nice closure.  It was epic, dude.  That movie was so massive.  It just looked like it was a disaster movie, a comic book movie, a vigilante movie, a war  movie all at once.  It was very ambitious.  And when all was said and done, the first time I watched it, that Thursday night, I  didn't even have a seat.  I was standing for two and a half hours in the back.  Jesus Christ.  Never once felt it.  Never once was it like, oh, I need a chair.  I was so enthralled by that.  Why wouldn't they give you a seat? 
[02:49:00]  You're Kevin Smith.  They had pulled out that screening, and I went up real late.  And so we know the folks up at the theater at Universal City Walk, because we've been  shooting spoilers up there.  So I said, hey, man, can me and Muse come watch it?  We'll pay, but we've got no seats.  He's like, yeah, you can come up and watch it in the projection booth.  So first we went up.  We were watching it from the projection booth, but it's really loud.  The projector, the IMAX projector particularly, is insanely loud.  So we're sitting right next to it, tougher to hear the soundtrack.  So we just went downstairs and stood in the back of the theater, man. 
[02:49:30]  And I'm like, I'm 42, so I'm standing up.  I've got varicose veins running down my legs and starting to collapse.  You know, I'm feeling the vapors, if you will.  And then it didn't matter, though.  The story had me in its grip so tightly that I didn't care, man.  I was just way into it, enough to go back the next day.  I love Bane.  All I do now is just Bane lines around the house.  I'm like, well, I'm sitting here, she's wondering why you shoot the man.  My wife was just like, I didn't like it in the movie. 
[02:50:00]  Please don't do it while we're fucking.  I had a tough time understanding Bane.  But, yeah, some people say that.  Yes, I really did.  There were definitely a few lines where it took me the second or third time to pick them up.  Very few, though.  I was really dialed in.  But, Kevin, as a filmmaker, why would you allow that to go through,  knowing that some people will have a tough time with some of the dialogue of that character?  To be fair, when they put the trailer out for the movie, the six-minute opening sequence that they put at the top of, I think it was Mission Impossible, when it was out. 
[02:50:30]  They put it out, and Warner Bros. released the six minutes of Bane on the plane and blah, blah, blah.  Yes.  When they did that, immediately, I guess it was like over 50% of the respondents were like, I can't understand what Bane's saying.  I wasn't one of them.  I love the fact that I couldn't understand.  It made me work harder to listen.  So I was like, in the movie business, we're so used to spoon-feeding everybody the easiest access possible to the story and the details.  And that's why there's so much exposition where somebody's just like, yeah, we have to get that bomb out of here or it might destroy this whole island and stuff like that. 
[02:51:00]  So for me, I like being challenged.  I like where they make me work a little bit harder.  So when I first heard the voice and it made me try harder to listen and to focus on it, zero in on it, focus in on it, I thought that was great.  Then I started reading stories about how so many people complained that they went through and redid all Bane's dialogue.  And there are clips on YouTube, there's this one great clip where they take, I think it's about 10 lines from the movie, from that opening sequence, and then put them up against the 10 lines, same 10 lines in the finished version of the movie. 
[02:51:30]  And they completely redid his voice.  He completely re-recorded his performance as well.  Really?  And given that, there were some people who were like, I still can't understand it.  And I would have preferred if they kept it the way it was in the six minutes that they showed us before the movie came out.  Go to YouTube, dude, just click in Bane Voice, and there's this one clip that somebody did.  It's fantastic, where you get to hear all the lines as they originally were in the release six minutes from back in Christmas. 
[02:52:00]  And then it's the same line from the current release version of the movie.  They did a lot of work on it.  So if they didn't do any of that work, you would have been really frustrated.  Yeah, no kidding.  Can I ask, I want to, because Kevin, you're the guy to ask this question.  You brought up the point that Bane got shot by Catwoman with a gun, and Batman never really beat him.  And people have complained about that left and right in the movie.  Bane deserved a better death.  I thought that that was awesome, because I felt like that brought so much closure to this particular Batman story, 
[02:52:30]  which was, Batman, you can't beat this guy.  He is stronger than you.  He is more powerful.  And then Catwoman comes in and shows Batman, look, some people need to be fucking shot and killed.  That's great.  And you're not going to go that far, so it's time to fucking step down.  You're going to wake up and get a few firearms.  That would have made that an Academy Award winning movie if there was just one brief two-minute monologue. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, that's classic, John.  I appreciate the fact that your parents were killed by a gun, but every once in a while.  Once in a while, dude.  And now Catwoman has something on him.  Yeah.  A little something.  But did Bane die, because they kind of made it look like, maybe he's not dead.  Maybe he's still alive.  Yeah, that was my only problem with it, was when she shot him, I was like, wait, is he dead?  And then they never went back to him.  Yeah, they never went back. 
[02:53:30]  Okay, I guess he is dead.  I think the way they get away with a lot of heightened violence in the Nolan flicks is they don't actually show it to you.  It's more suggested.  If you think back to The Dark Knight, whenever Heath Ledger is killing someone with a knife, you never see it.  It's done with, like, a cutaway and a piercing kind of a violin shriek or something like that.  So, like, you know, when he's brought to the gangster who's like, oh, I'll give a million for him, 500,000 for him dead, a million for him alive so I can teach him manners.  He brings him in there and he puts the knife to the dead. 
[02:54:00]  The Joker pops up out of the bag, puts the knife to the dude's face, to his mouth, and starts telling him the story about, you know, I got these scars.  And they tell the story and looks at the other guy and goes, why so serious?  And then he quick does a movement to cut, and they cut from behind and the dude drops to the floor.  Now, logically speaking, he had a knife in his mouth.  If you cut some dude's mouth with a knife, he ain't going to die.  He comes off to the ground and starts screaming and stuff.  But in this movie, it's represented as him literally being dead.  He drops him to the floor. 
[02:54:30]  He's no longer a threat whatsoever.  They did that a few times in the movie.  Every time he starts using a knife, there's no blood in evidence, so you get away with it.  Same thing with shooting Bane, man.  They shoot him with two rockets, but there's no blood or anything, so it's a pretty horrible death.  But at the same time, you're like, I'm sorry, did he die?  Because I see no evidence of blood.  Right, right.  I don't even think they show his dead body.  Like, he gets thrown, I mean, I only saw it once, but he gets thrown back when he gets shot.  Yeah, across the room.  Yeah, he's just like in a wall or something. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, he hits the wall and he's plumped on the floor.  But that confused, what you just said about the knife thing, the knife scene in Dark Knight  when he kills Gamble, like, that confused me, too.  I remember seeing that in the theater and being like, what the fuck just happened?  Did he just kill that guy?  Or, like, it was confusing.  If he killed him, did he kill him by cutting his cheek open?  Like, that would hurt, don't you?  Yeah, it would hurt.  That would suck.  If he was there unattended for hours, you would definitely bleed out.  But in that moment, you wouldn't suddenly be like, I'm dead like a video game character,  you know, just dropping to the floor. 
[02:55:30]  Right, yeah.  And even if he moved it from the dude's mouth quickly down to his throat, I mean, I've never  had my throat slit, but any time you see someone get their throat slit in a movie, it usually  takes them a little bit to die.  So you make gurgle.  Yeah, they gurgle a little.  It goes down.  Yeah, they go to gurgle.  A little gurgle.  Yeah, it's a good point about that.  We could sit here and pick a point, minor stuff about Dark Knight that bummed me out,  but overall, just such a, it was so big, dude.  And they treated Batman, with the exception of the first half hour, where Batman's like, 
[02:56:00]  I won't be Batman anymore, which is something you would never do.  They treated Batman with absolute respect, I thought.  And I gave him a nice closure, nice ending.  What did you think about Batman?  I mean, Batman's always been known for using gadgets and using, you know, his money to purchase  and make and invent these gadgets to use on his arch nemesis.  But I felt like all Batman did with Bane was try to throw fists at him the whole movie,  and I kind of thought that was a little lame.  People can...  Well, he had gadgets, right?  But the gadgets were kind of like...  And another thing I thought that was kind of lame about it was that he tries to throw that magic drug powder 
[02:56:30]  in Bane's face.  Like, you should know he's from the League of Shadows.  It's not going to work, dude.  Yeah, but people...  Yeah, but people...  Ah, they got your cowardly and deception.  People complain about the gadget thing, and my whole response to that was,  they showed the gadgets in the first movie, they showed more of them in the second movie.  Nolan is clearly a filmmaker that was like, we've been there,  we don't need to retrace this right now.  This is an emotional, personal story about Batman. 
[02:57:00]  But they're pitching Bane as this superhuman guy,  like he's got this apparatus strapped to his face that's pumping him with super juice,  and then Batman shows up with a bum leg,  and instead of doing anything, instead of using his cunning or gadgets,  he just throws his meaty fists at Bane.  The thing I didn't get was, they showed you that leg thing he gets put on,  where he kicks through the cement thing.  I'm like, why didn't he use that ever?  That to kick through Bane's fucking face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's definitely some issues with The Dark Knight Rises. 
[02:57:30]  There's some holes.  A little bit.  The leg brace is something I had a hard time with, too, where I'm like,  and it's weird because, you know, you've got a movie about these people who are like,  we have a clean energy device, which we've somehow turned into a box.  Well, how about the fact that the entire Gotham police force is underground for like a month,  and nobody has facial hair when they come out?  The movie did walk some weird mixed line between the right and the left politically,  where it was like, look, you lefties, your fucking clean air device is evil, see? 
[02:58:00]  And then there was the Wall Street commentary.  I was like, I don't know which side Christopher Nolan is on right now.  It was kind of like, it was like in the issues that debate amongst all you mere mortals,  the only thing that matters is Batman.  Yeah.  I got to agree with him on that one.  I liked the movie.  I thought, I loved the action.  It was huge.  To see it on the big IMAX screen was amazing.  Let's not forget about Anne Hathaway, too.  She looked great in that little cat fucking. 
[02:58:30]  I thought she did a great job.  Absolutely.  She was gorgeous, too.  They were saying she's not Michelle Pfeiffer, but I was like, well, Michelle Pfeiffer did great,  but really think about that Catwoman in Batman Returns.  Like, that's not even close.  Not even.  Catwoman in the comics.  I think Anne Hathaway was better.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she was.  That's not saying so much, though.  One of my best friends that I grew up with is Anne Hathaway's first cousin,  and he came out to a show the other night, and I was talking to him,  and just in the middle of the conversation, I go, oh, by the way, 
[02:59:00]  your cousin was the best Catwoman ever.  And he was like, I know.  Wasn't she great?  She was really good.  But it's funny watching a guy talk about, literally saying, like,  it's my cousin playing Catwoman.  But she was the best.  Michelle Pfeiffer was good, but the fucking origin of that,  we talked about that last time I said it,  with the cats biting her fingers made her Catwoman.  Go fuck yourself.  All of a sudden, she's like, I've been licked by zombie cats.  I am Catwoman.  Yeah, that was stupid.  That had nothing to do with the comics. 
[02:59:30]  No.  So by that alone, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, I thought,  was a massive improvement in backstory.  But just in terms of performance,  like, I'm not the world's biggest Anne Hathaway fan,  but I thought she was really good in the flick.  Yeah, definitely.  There are a lot of people on Twitter.  I kid you not.  This movie came out one month and four days ago.  I'm getting blown up on Twitter with people going,  you jackasses are spoiling the movie.  Oh, I know.  I'm seeing it here, too.  A lot of people are pissed off the spoilers.  At least a month old now, right?  It came out July 20th. 
[03:00:00]  It's now August 24th.  Yeah, that's their fault, then.  That's plenty of time.  If you haven't been involved, it would be like,  you can't talk about Avengers yet.  Spoilers.  Hey, man.  It happened.  Yeah, stop.  Kevin, we absolutely have to go,  but what do you got going on?  Give us one more time.  On Saturday, if you're anywhere near Manhattan,  right near New York City,  you come up, see Clerks projected on the big screen  for free in Central Park.  Brian O'Hallery is going to be there.  You've got to play Dante. 
[03:00:30]  Cool.  The very next day, on Sunday,  if you want to come be on our TV show,  Comic Book Men,  come down to Jane Salenbaugh's Secret Stash  in Red Bank from 2 to 5.  We're doing a signing.  You don't have to buy anything.  People come in,  just have stuff tagged or whatever.  Bring your books if you've already bought them,  the tough shit books.  And we're going to do a signing  from 2 to 5 on Sunday  and shoot that for the TV show.  So not only can you get your craft signed,  you might be on TV with the Comic Book Men.  Very cool, Kevin.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Yes, Kevin Smith. 
[03:01:00]  Thanks, man.  And we'll talk to you soon.  Great talking to you guys.  Love talking Batman this early in the morning.  Absolutely.  Thank you, guys.  Go ahead.  Take it to the camera.  And, of course, that Kevin Smith on Twitter.  A few things going on on TV during our Kevin Smith chat.  Yeah, we're a little distracted.  What is anyone...  Do we know anything about this Empire State Building thing yet?  That's pretty much...  I was trying to...  Maybe now there's some stories,  but when I was Googling this,  there was nothing.  Fucking five people shot at the Empire State Building.  Outside the Empire State Building.  That's...  What are we, about 10, 15 blocks from there? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  There's no real details.  No real details yet.  But what was more distracting and annoying to me...  Yeah.  I saw a statement from Dee Snider from Twisted System.  Oh, you see.  He's angry with Paul Ryan for using We're Not Gonna Take It.  We're Not Gonna Take It.  There it is.  Dee speaks out on Ryan's campaign using the song We're Not Gonna Take It.  He says that's not what that song is about. 
[03:02:00]  He doesn't want a Republican, I guess, using that song.  By the way, the same song that is being used in a fucking motel commercial...  It's so...  Because We're Not Gonna Take It is the little theme for...  We're Not Gonna Take Coffee Machines in our bathroom.  We want fresh coffee.  Look, you're not this fucking shining bright light of ethics and musical...  You don't understand.  What?  What?  That's what the song was about.  Oh!  Oh, I didn't think it was. 
[03:02:30]  Every musician that complains about a song being used, it's always somebody on the right  and they go, oh, in my song, I don't want this fucking meathead Republican guy written.  Right.  It's like, but you wrote a meathead fucking song.  The fuck do you think you wrote?  Fire and Rain?  That's right.  Face it.  Yeah, he sold out that song years...  But We're Not Gonna Take It.  Have you seen the commercial?  No, I don't know that commercial.  Oh, we gotta show it to Joe.  If anyone knows anything about the Empire State Building for reals, please. 
[03:03:00]  It says the gunman is dead, by the way.  According to several people shot in your Empire State Building.  Eight shot, gunman dead.  That's what CBS New York is saying.  Jesus Christ.  What happened there?  Jesus.  Fuck you, people.  Dude, it is...  We're desensitized.  Like, this guy just went on a shooting spree, literally, I don't know, 12, 15 blocks from  here, and we're like, eh, whatever.  I don't know how it happened, because it's totally illegal to have a gun in Manhattan. 
[03:03:30]  So I don't know how it happened.  How the fuck did that happen?  I don't know.  There's gun control laws in place that shouldn't have happened.  Yeah.  He broke the law.  Well, it just proves there's too many guns on the street.  Huh?  This is, but, I see, you see shit like this, you're like, do you realize how fucking fragile  it all really is?  Oh, it's all just on the brink of breaking down, Joe.  We don't realize how much we trust other people.  You're just walking down the street at any second.  Someone could just unload.  Something like this could happen.  I'm there for you, Joe, though.  I'm there for you.  I'd take care of that motherfucker. 
[03:04:00]  I'd fucking take care of him before he got to the second guy.  I'll give him two.  I'll give him two guys, and then I'd be like, holy fuck, running gun battle.  Oh, man.  I think it was like the Matrix Lobby.  Oh, Matrix Lobby fucking shit.  Here's what would happen.  I'd pull my gun out, and the cops would unload on me.  Who am I kidding?  The most dangerous thing an armed citizen could do in Manhattan is pull his gun out, whether  he needs it or not.  He's fucking lit up by the police. 
[03:04:30]  But Joe makes a good point.  You have to walk through life counting on too many fucking people.  Yeah.  Dude, you count on everybody.  You have to count on so many people to be doing the right thing at all times.  In your entire life.  How about just driving down the road?  There are no fences.  Those two-lane roads where the cars are just flying at you.  They're less than, what, five feet away from you.  Dude, I've literally...  And you just got to count that not one of those assholes has decided that he's going  to veer open to your lane.  Closing velocity of 120 miles an hour.  Dude, I've literally been in my bed at night and lie awake for like an hour, two hours, 
[03:05:00]  thinking about how crazy it is that anybody is allowed to drive a car.  Do you think of how fucking dangerous that is?  Like, with all the lunatics and careless people out there, not only is it dangerous, they've  decided in the year 2012 it's still cool to have cars just flying right at you as you're  driving.  It's nuts, man.  Why?  You're manipulating.  Why can't we at least spread those lanes apart a little more?  Space.  Money.  You literally have this remote-controlled machine where you're twisting, pulling levers, hitting 
[03:05:30]  pedals.  It's like a dance you're doing in this fucking thing.  And hurtling tons of steel.  Don't forget texting the whole time, too.  Yes.  Down the road, with other tons of steel, winging all over the place.  Winging right by your ear.  And now you're distracting yourself by fucking talking to people with fucking wordy machines.  Oh my God.  You're just typing to people.  Texting way more dangerous than drunk driving, I think.  And they make crashing a car a game at the carnival.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  It's just a fun time.  Let's all laugh and rear-end each other.  Yeah.  Do you ever see Hannah and her sisters?  The Woody Allen movies?  Sorry.  I didn't mean to bring up Woody Allen movies.  Oh, fuck.  That hack.  I don't want to say Woody Allen.  I read that shit.  He hates Woody Allen.  I'll tell you why.  I'll be honest with you.  His movies are not funny.  They're not entertaining.  They're long-winded and boring.  But they're not supposed to be like Will Ferrell kind of funny.  No, I'm not looking for that.  But I want something interesting.  I want something fucking interesting. 
[03:06:30]  He develops very good characters.  No, they're bore-fest movies.  I'm sorry.  Listen, we'll try to find a Woody Allen movie for you that's got some sound effects and  pratfalls in it.  Maybe like Woody Allen has to go back to school with like seven-year-olds.  Don't you fucking try it.  He has to graduate from junior high school.  He moves in with a monkey to fucking make his rent.  Don't you twist this around.  Are you saying Anthony enjoys a lot of Adam Sandler movies?  Ugh, I hate Adam Sandler.  Don't twist it around to make it sound like if I don't like Woody Allen, I'm a fucking  a crittin.  But if he directed the new Three Stooges, you'd love him to death, wouldn't you? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, shit.  You said the Three Stooges was funny!  Look, I did not.  Joe's leaving.  I said I left.  The Three Stooges was funny and I bought it because you said that.  You sort of did.  You sort of did.  Here's what I said.  You sort of did.  I said I did not want to laugh and I found myself laughing at the movie at certain parts.  I didn't say it's hysterical.  That's a thumbs up, my friend.  Exactly.  And when they make that, by the way, when they make the Three Stooges, they're not out 
[03:07:30]  to make this fucking all great Woody Allen genius movie.  Okay?  They know it's going to be a piece of shit and if you get a few chuckles out of it, it's  more than I've gotten out of a Woody Allen movie.  He's a boring fucking old Jewish guy and he's not funny.  Not funny.  I seem to remember you sitting there saying that.  And I also, by the way, if you're going to tell me they didn't try to make a film out  of the Three Stooges, I remember the fucking scene where Mo gets angry at them out of, 
[03:08:00]  because he loves them.  And he said, fuck you!  They tried to make it a movie!  You don't like the sensitive moment with Mo?  Watch your scram and get out of here.  I'm sick of looking after you, too.  No, I miss him.  You don't have a leg to stand on it.  Oh, my God.  The Fairley Brothers.  Are you saying that Woody Allen is overrated?  Yeah.  Yes.  Did you see Midnight in Paris?  No.  It was a terrific little film.  I'm not going to see Woody Allen movies. 
[03:08:30]  He stinks.  What about that one where he's the water boy for the football team?  No, that was Adam Sandler and I don't like Adam Sandler.  Get back to Dee Schneider because Danny found more info on this guy.  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, we're not going to take it.  That's not what the song is about for What's-His-Face, Ryan or whatever.  Yeah.  Dee Snider's We're Not-Gonna-Take-It is also the theme song for the American reality comedy  television series, Betty White's Off Their Rockers.  Oh, my God.  And could you get the motel commercial, please, for Joe DeRosa?  Don't fucking get on there saying, yeah, it's ruining the sanctity of his song. 
[03:09:00]  Wait till you see what he's done with his song.  And he's singing in the commercial.  Oh, it makes me sick.  He's changed the words.  This is like when Springsteen was like-  That's how desperate this guy is with his fucking music and he's not going to let Ryan  use it.  He's stupid at this.  It makes me sick.  Who gives a fuck he doesn't agree with him politically?  Yeah, you should fucking count your blessings.  Who used Born in the USA?  Reagan?  Reagan wanted to use pink houses.  Or was it Bush?  One of the Republican presidents used Born in the USA and Springsteen got all mad. 
[03:09:30]  Springsteen got mad.  John Cougar got mad at pink houses being used because Reagan wanted to use it.  Ain't that America for you and me?  And he was all fucking like, you know, pissy about it.  There couldn't be two bigger meathead rock musicians than Mellencamp and Springsteen.  And Springsteen.  It's like your whole fan base are fucking Republicans.  That's your whole fucking fan base.  Right.  Some goddamn dock worker.  Yeah, I can't. 
[03:10:00]  I don't like the middle American farmer.  This town was all right, so all the Asians moved in.  Yeah.  Those are the guys.  Yeah, what do you think?  The fucking hard right guy isn't fucking digging on some John Cougar?  This will put it in perspective for you, Joe.  If this is it, I hope it is.  We're not going to take it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Oh, we ain't going to take it.  They're running out of the hotel with their coffee pots.  This is embarrassing.  Marching down the street with their...  Coffee in a hotel bathroom again.  At Extended Stay America, you get a fully equipped kitchen with Culligan-filtered water, free grab-and-go breakfast, and free internet Wi-Fi. 
[03:10:30]  Free breath.  No continental breakfast.  Extended Stay America, by the day, week, or month.  Extended Stay America, the new way to stay.  Book now.  That's fucking embarrassing.  There you go.  Same guy.  That's fucking embarrassing.  He's worried about Ryan.  Oh, my God.  By the way, what hotel do you make coffee in the bathroom?  What the fuck are they talking about?  But I've never had a problem making coffee in my room.  Who gives a fuck where the coffee pot is?  I need my coffee, and if it's there and I can make it somewhere in the room, the bathroom, I don't give a fuck. 
[03:11:00]  I never used those coffee makers, because something always skeeves me out about them.  There was a phone call to this show, probably back in 2004 or 2005, where some trucker called in, talking about how he had to clean his underwear, or some chick with her panties.  And he used the coffee maker to fucking clean his dirty underwear.  I was just like, fuck down.  Why would you do that when there's a sink, in most cases?  I think he said something about he wanted to get the water really hot or something.  I want a pot, a coffee pot, pot, I want a... 
[03:11:30]  I never realized this was a problem, that they needed a whole commercial.  It's not a problem.  They're not going to take it, though.  That's fucking embarrassing, man.  And he's pissed at fucking Paul Ryan using it.  Stop it.  What do we know about the gunman?  He's dead.  Empire State Building, five, several, they're now saying several people shot.  Near.  Eight people, I heard.  Near the Empire State Building.  Suspect shot to death by police.  That must be something for the cops.  All of a sudden, some guy starts unloading, and they're just like, finally. 
[03:12:00]  That's fucking scary, man.  How close is that to here?  What street's the Empire State Building on?  That's what I was saying.  It's 34th?  Yeah, I think it's close enough.  14, 15 blocks.  It's fucking scary, man.  How are people getting these details?  He shot them in the neck.  Kenny, what do you know about this incident?  Anything, Kenny?  You getting any inside info?  No.  It's 34th and 5th.  34th and 5th.  Is this going to affect my drive out in any way, shape, or form? 
[03:12:30]  Negative.  All right.  That's all I care about.  Yeah.  My drive.  Jesus Christ.  We might have to leave early just in case, Ant.  Yeah, we should, probably.  We might, just in case.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I hear they're evacuating the area, so maybe we should go.  Oh, well.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard.  You probably heard wrong.  Iraq, you taking a lesson here?  This is fudging.  Fudging info.  Fudge.  And details.  That, but no other info, motivation for the shooting, anything?  What am I, an information booth? 
[03:13:00]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  You're a, you know?  I'm nothing.  I'm a has-been.  You're a man of the world.  You look like a knowledgeable man.  You're wearing your fucking cabana shirt today.  You're a poor judge of character.  It's travel day.  Don't start with clothing, because you already lost one clothing battle.  You kind of did, Joe.  I didn't, I don't feel that I lost that.  I forgot about that.  I didn't feel that I lost that.  You had him on the ropes, and then your niceness.  You dressed like a fucking dirt grader today.  Fuck, you had him. 
[03:13:30]  I know, I know.  This isn't a great afternoon.  Talk about the Troy Kwan fight.  The Troy Kwan fight, but this is the thing.  Troy got that look in his eyes where he's like, I'm going to start getting real, and he started  shaking.  Hey, Joe.  Because he was up all night DJing at a club somewhere.  Troy changed his hairdo since then.  I know, I saw it.  I saw it.  Somebody's taking notice in this place.  He's got that shimp after he gets slapped hairdo now.  Holy fuck!  That's hilarious!  We've been trying to figure it out for days. 
[03:14:00]  You know it?  It would fling down, and he'd have to fling it back across his face.  Holy shit, that's great.  Ah, Joe, quit.  Leave right now.  No, that's it.  That's it.  It's not going to get better than that.  Shimp!  That's funny.  Someone took notice, though, in this building, in this very studio, actually, after our show.  Who?  Did you hear about that?  Well, Fez was saying that...  Fez likes to Troy?  One of the producers of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:14:30]  He likes when a guy just changes his hairstyle out of nowhere like that.  He found it very attractive.  Never said Troy, but we all speculate it's got to be Troy.  Well, who else would it be?  Exactly.  No one else has changed his hairstyle.  Do you think he's talking about when E-Rock dyed his hair blonde and he looked like Fat Eminem?  Sorry, E-Rock.  I'm sorry, man.  Don't say sorry after the fact.  I know.  But Voss called him Vanilla Icebox.  That was the funniest fucking thing.  Vanilla Icebox. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock, I made it to 10.  You know that.  No, you didn't.  Come on.  I made it to 10, meaning I didn't make fun of you today.  I'm sorry.  We're fudging the numbers.  Right.  You're at 10.  But I said I wouldn't make fun of you today.  I think I did it.  E-Rock, lighten up.  Stop talking about fudge.  You're getting E-Rocky.  Oh, see what happens.  I laughed at a few, but I haven't said anything.  I'm good.  Me and you were good today.  Do you guys have a thing going where you're not going to trash him until? 
[03:15:30]  No.  You've got to listen to the replay.  I can't.  I'm serious.  I never get to hear the show.  We gave him an assignment and he fucking blew it.  No, he didn't blow it.  Turn up Fox News because Jacques Boothby witnessed the shooting.  You were walking on the sidewalk and you heard what?  I heard gunshots and people started running.  I wasn't sure if it was gunshots or if it was just normal noises of New York City or something.  Noises.  Normal noises.  And then I just looked around and people were just laying in the middle of the street and on the sidewalk. 
[03:16:00]  How did the crowd around you react?  What did they do?  They just fled.  Started running and said, I think they were screaming and running.  You stupid fuck.  They thought it was far away.  And how many people did you see hit by bullets?  Was it just the one moment?  I saw four.  I didn't actually see the gunman.  I'm not sure if he was in a car or walking, but I saw four people get hit.  And clearly you heard gunshots too. 
[03:16:30]  Do you recall how many or what the sound was like?  Bloomberg's going to lose his fucking mind on this now.  Almost like a very deep, almost like a rumbling.  Yeah, really.  He's going to punch everyone.  I don't know if it was the buildings or what, but it didn't even seem like a sharp gunshot.  You're going to lose our french fries over this one.  I'm not sure how to describe it.  But it was like I accounted for shots.  No more eyes, Jack.  No more eyes, Jack.  Where are you now?  He's gone.  I'm still on scene.  Some of the NYPD wanted to speak to me about it since I witnessed it. 
[03:17:00]  So I'm still here just waiting to speak with them.  Okay, Jackie, listen.  We'll let you go for a moment, but we'd like to bring you back maybe in the next hour here  after you talk to police.  You have a remarkable story to tell, and we're trying to piece all this together as we go  throughout the morning.  Jackie Boothby, a colleague of ours here at the Fox News channel who was at the scene  and literally...  And they believe that there is a soul shooter, and that person is in fact now. 
[03:17:30]  Let's go back to Lester Holt, who's on the...  ...being let out of the area right now.  Give me just another sense of the surrounding area.  Manhattan as we continue to watch the headlines.  Just really, in some cases, across the street and...  Of nervousness.  Oh my God, you're so annoying.  Quick break here.  Back to this breaking news after this.  Because there haven't been people leaving building.  And they're building up.  New Yorkers, frankly, need to be at work right now.  But a lot of tourists are gazing down the street. 
[03:18:00]  They have a small group of witnesses there.  I like it.  It sounds cool.  They've been interviewed on the neighborhood.  Typically...  I don't know.  It's like at the end of a movie when they do the news montage.  Yeah, there's so many ways to die in New York.  I think Dennis Larry pointed out.  Did you hear about the guy eating his Chinese food?  No.  It's a huge story today, too.  It is?  I guess he was leaning up against a wall downtown somewhere, just eating his Chinese food and  minding his own business.  And a car comes flying up on the sidewalk and just fucking smashes the guy against the wall. 
[03:18:30]  He's dead?  Dead.  Damn, yo.  Just taking his lunch and eating some Chinese food.  You really do have to watch.  Cars fly off these roads all the time.  I think I'm going to move out of the city, man.  I'm really starting to get freaked out living here.  I feel it more and more every day when I walk down the street.  I'm looking around me.  I'm fucking paranoid.  You always have to figure out who the problems are.  I look all the time at you.  It's too goddamn much.  I don't let anyone creep up on my back behind me. 
[03:19:00]  I will stop in some instances, turn to the side, and let people pass me just because I  don't want them behind me.  These fucking SUVs and all the...  For Christ's sake.  I'm sorry.  You got an SUV.  But you live out in the...  I live out in fucking Long Island.  You know, you at least live out in the country where there's snow and, you know...  You know what I mean.  Where there's snow and fucking...  A tree?  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  I just didn't want them to think I was making fun...  I didn't want them to think...  I don't care.  But I wasn't, though.  I'm part of the problem, Joe.  I am.  I am.  I seriously am. 
[03:19:30]  I drive like a maniac.  And, you know...  But you also do something for the...  I don't know, Ant.  I know.  For some reason, you're...  It doesn't upset me.  Anything you do...  Nothing either of you guys do upsets me ever.  My pool that's heated to 92 degrees is also a fucking bane on the energy.  A burn!  A burn!  His pool is very warm!  That's fucking hilarious.  Anthony, when Anthony has a party, it looks like that...  It looks like that underground community of cops. 
[03:20:00]  Just fucking a bunch of police stumbling around Anthony's house.  All nicely shaven and clean.  With all due respect to Kevin Smith, how do you not mind that you don't understand what  the fucking character's saying?  I understand spoon-feeding and all that, but fuck.  I understood it.  I didn't have a hard time with it.  I had a real tough time.  I saw it in IMAX, and I had a tough time.  IMAX, they said it was worse.  Big and bassy and fucking hard on the stand.  It was worse in IMAX than regular theaters.  Nolan made it purposely unintelligible at first, because he said, like... 
[03:20:30]  He was like, yeah, that's kind of the point.  Like, you're kind of not supposed to be able to understand them fully, and it's supposed  to be weird and off-putting, but too many people were like, dude, what the fuck do you  want us to do for two hours?  The only dialogue scene from him I enjoyed was at the stadium, because he was projecting  a little bit more, and I could totally hear everything.  I didn't see it in IMAX, so it was fun.  That's bad.  Are you poor?  You missed out.  Huh?  You're poor?  Yeah, I couldn't afford IMAX. 
[03:21:00]  It was either the regular movie in candy or IMAX.  Nice.  Or illegal download.  I was thinking of the D. Schneider-Stanley Steamer commercial.  That's another one.  Oh my god, he did that one, too.  He's got two commercials where he's whoring out his music.  I don't think it's his music.  No, I think he sings the Stanley Steamer song.  But he sings it as, but he's D, but he doesn't, I don't think they use his song.  Are you sure?  I'm not sure.  Let's listen.  Find the D. Schneider-Stanley Steamer.  That's why it's funny that he has a problem with Ryan using his song. 
[03:21:30]  He's already whoring out the Steamer.  These guys were doing coke.  This must be it right here.  Yeah, yeah.  Off of strippers and showers in the 80s.  They were doing fucking Stanley Steamer commercial.  He's in full makeup.  You won the D. Schneider weekend!  Oh my god.  That carpet is fucked.  He looks ridiculous.  I'm good. 
[03:22:00]  Nobody cleans the rock and roll out of your carpet like Stanley Steamer.  Look at when he, can you rewind to when he actually sings?  Yes.  Look at how much he can't live with himself with what he's doing.  You're right.  Look at that, dude.  You can see it.  I'm good.  He's like, uh.  And by the way, why is that guy painted up like John Wayne Gacy?  Literally the exact same fucking makeup.  Yes.  Look at that.  Clown makeup.  But like in the same exact style, I mean.  Yes.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Oh, we like D, though. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, that's.  Oh, well.  Never mind.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  There's a feeling of just utter confusion, and no one knows what's happening.  There are people on cell phones taking pictures, and the police are trying to move us all  back now even further to get away.  There must be two dozen cars.  Ten shot.  Ten shot now?  Oh, man.  Fucking Bloomberg is going to be, because he's like at the forefront of this mayor's against  guns shit.  And it's like, look, anything you could do to get the illegal guns off the street, fine. 
[03:23:00]  But like, he really wants to just shut out any citizen having a gun.  Just this part of the city.  Here is part of what we're learning from those who were there one hour ago.  Roll this.  I was standing at the corner of 34th Street and 5th Avenue, waiting for the light to turn  green so that I could cross towards 33rd Street on 34th.  And all of a sudden, we heard shots.  They sounded like firecrackers.  I was planning an attack of my own. 
[03:23:30]  A girl standing next to me, a young lady in her 20s, got shot on the hip and fell down.  And two Empire State Building guards got shot, and they fell down on 34th Street in the middle  of it.  And there was mayhem.  Everybody started running all over the place.  First, we didn't know what was happening.  And then suddenly, we saw, apparently, the shooter, he was dead and lying right in front  of the Empire State Building. 
[03:24:00]  Young boy, a white boy.  Oh, thanks.  And he was dead.  More reaction that we're getting by the minute here, including our own Jackie Boothby, who  reported just before the commercial break there that a woman was shot and dropped at her  feet on the sidewalk.  She saw at least three others lying on the sidewalk in front of her.  If the police reporting that we're getting remains accurate throughout the factual gathering  of this story, what we have here is a person who was fired from his job, left his workplace, 
[03:24:30]  and came back to exact his revenge.  David Lee Miller's there outside the Empire State Building.  David Lee, what do you have now?  One of these.  I can tell you that the building has, in fact, now reopened a few moments ago.  I talked to a security guard.  Yes, please come up to our observation booth.  It's like David Lee was on the phone. </pre>
