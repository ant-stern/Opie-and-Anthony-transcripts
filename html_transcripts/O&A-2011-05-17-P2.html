<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a significant amount of teasing around a mystery announcement for their "The Virus" channel (Sirius XM 105, Sirius 206), an announcement that ultimately never materialized.  The build-up centered around recent guests: Elizabeth Berkley, Mario Lopez, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar from "Saved by the Bell." The show included an awkward segment featuring the fictional band Zack Attack.  Gosselaar's physical transformation between "Saved by the Bell" and "NYPD Blue" was also a topic, sparking discussion about potential steroid use.

Anthony's thin skin regarding Twitter criticism was highlighted, focusing on an apparent "banning" of a co-host's account.  A call-in segment with Scorch, a radio personality with a past relationship with one of the hosts, featured a simulcast with the original Oompa Loompa actors.  This simulcast resulted in several instances of profanity and considerable panic from Scorch.  A substantial portion of the show dissected Scorch's broadcasting style, his perceived self-promotion, and his history with Opie and Anthony.

Further into the broadcast, the hosts revisited Troy Kwan's one-year anniversary of a date with an intern's girlfriend.  They discussed details of the date, including the location and activities, with strong implications of sexual activity.  The show concluded with a promotion for a Pocono Raceway contest, directing listeners to SiriusXM.com/thevirus for more information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah!  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  You knew that already.  I guess they went all morning...  Opie and Anthony are gone, obviously.  They went all morning  teasing that there was a new show coming to the virus.  That's this channel.  XM 105, Sirius 206. 
[00:00:30]  They went all morning  and never mentioned what show is coming.  E-Rock, did I miss that part?  Did they mention what show was coming?  No, not at all.  They never mentioned the new show.  Nope.  You know I know what the new show is.  Do you?  Is this the reason that your special delivery got cut down?  Well, I mean, it's the reason  some things got changed up on the weekends.  I mean, it's not the direct...  You know, it's not like...  Oh, okay.  ...replacing anything.  Well, I haven't been here, 
[00:01:00]  so I'm just finding all this out.  Well, I mean, you haven't been here in years, really.  I mean, you know, are you here ever?  Well, I'm not here physically last week.  Oh, I see.  And you were missed.  There was a lot of more room physically for all of us, though.  I get it, yeah.  Yeah.  Why did I say that?  Because you're an asshole.  No, but what did it mean?  If you get it.  It means you're an asshole.  No, if you get it.  What was the joke?  It was a fat joke.  That's right.  Okay, you did get it.  You did.  But I do know what the new show is, and I can proudly say right here on After Opie and Anthony 
[00:01:30]  Live that the new show coming to the virus is, I guess, going to be mentioned tomorrow,  because they didn't get to it today.  And I'm not going to steal that thunder.  But today was a hell of a show anyway.  Mark Paul Gosler was in here.  What's up with, it seems like everybody from Saved by the Bell over the last three weeks  has been in this building.  Elizabeth Berkley was here.  Mario Lopez was here.  Mark Paul Gosler was here.  This is all in the last three weeks.  Why wouldn't they get all these people on the same day? 
[00:02:00]  I have no idea.  Different projects.  They're not doing Saved by the Bell anymore.  Yeah, but Jimmy Fallon has been, you know, for three years trying to get a Saved by the  Bell reunion thing going on, and we've had every cast member at Sirius in, like, the  last week and a half.  And Jimmy Fallon had everybody but one, I think.  Who?  I'm trying to think it was Tiffany Amber Thiessen.  I saw you slipped a note to Opie.  You wanted him to talk about the Casey Kasem episode?  That one was a little awkward, yeah.  Why was it awkward?  Because it was about a band that didn't exist. 
[00:02:30]  Zack Attack?  Zack Attack.  They had songs.  Oh, yeah, they did.  Wait a minute.  Let me see if we got that.  Friends Forever?  No, what was the other one?  I mean, that was a single.  Friends Forever was the big single.  Yeah, they had another one.  You're the TV guy.  I mean, obviously I look like I'm a little more active than you.  I think it was like, did we ever have a chance?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the ballad.  Yeah, yeah.  Which one did you prefer?  I forgot about Friends Forever.  That's the one.  That's the single.  That's the radio-friendly version.  But yeah, did we ever have a chance to sort of, like, you know, mellow out and really 
[00:03:00]  think about stuff.  But I just can't imagine why they don't get everybody in on the same day.  I mean, it's amazing that everybody's still working except Lark Voorhees.  Yeah, what is she doing?  You never see her anymore.  When she left, she went and did a soap opera.  Yeah, because she didn't do college years.  And then I think one movie, and then that was it.  I like that you tried to call out Mark Paul Gosselaar on taking steroids.  I always wondered that, because when that college show started...  Is that something that plagued you for a long time, for years? 
[00:03:30]  All right, you've watched the show, like everybody has.  He was a skinny dude on the high school version.  But when that college thing started, he was bigger than Slater.  Do you believe him about the football thing?  Probably.  Do you?  I would have no reason to doubt him.  And then you said, and then NYPD Blue Cave, and you were so much...  Much smaller.  And he was like, yeah, it was ten years later.  I wasn't keeping track of time.  You're not good with time.  I'm getting texts from people guessing.  One person is guessing if Big Kev is the new show. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know what that even means.  It's been on the channel for three years.  I told you, the new show will be...  Well, not four years in a row.  Let's not get carried away.  Within the last.  Four years sporadically.  The new show will be announced tomorrow.  I also wanted to say, Roland, we ended the show with another guest booking.  Another nervous day.  Another sweaty day.  Yes.  Another high blood pressure day.  Yes.  A day that your doctor warns you about.  Yeah, but it was a success.  Another one for you.  And in the end, it's always a success. 
[00:04:30]  Bring him back.  Bring him back soon.  But I saw you panicking when they described the guests in a not-so-flattering way an hour  before they got here.  I know.  And they're so nice, too.  I know.  They're very nice.  My favorite was Eric asking them a weight question.  It's like me asking, what's your die secret?  Really?  Really?  Come on, Al.  Where are we going?  It wasn't a weight question.  Fatso.  Oh, he called you fatso.  Oh, Mark Paul, um, how'd you gain so much weight?  Roland is making a very effeminate, girly, sort of teenage girl type of pose. 
[00:05:00]  So, how'd you lose weight, Mark Paul?  The gym?  No.  I kid because I love.  I kid because I love.  I love you.  You're on fire now.  Eric kicked you?  Yes.  Why did he kick you?  Because Jimmy made a Taco Bell joke and I laughed.  And then they laughed at my laugh.  And then he kicked me very hard.  Why?  I didn't kick you very hard.  Did it hurt, Roland?  If they try listening, I could barely walk right now.  Somebody's feedbacking in asking if the new show is the Ron and Sam show, Ronnie and Sammy 
[00:05:30]  Sweethearts.  I told you.  Could it be?  I'm not going to tell you what the new show is.  I'm going to check that out.  It's not going to be announced until tomorrow.  But during the interview...  He really opened up, too.  Huh?  He really opened up.  Mark Paul, he had fun.  Yeah, they both did.  And Brecken, Meyer, and Mark Paul Gosler were talking about being on Twitter and all the  negative stuff.  And for the second day in a row, Anthony talks about how, you know, one guy on Twitter can  ruin your whole day without even acknowledging that yesterday... 
[00:06:00]  You know who the one guy on Twitter was that ruined my whole day?  Anthony!  Like, he doesn't like when people bash him on Twitter, but then he goes on and decides  it'd be funny to post a screen cap of his phone with my Twitter profile and a big red  band under it.  I don't think he wanted to act to Josh Lucas.  I was going to pitch him until I heard his story.  I'm like, uh-oh.  He also now...  He almost came in the studio.  I love the story that now Ant has a story about, from everybody who comes in here, about 
[00:06:30]  somebody who mistreated his lovely girlfriend.  He said the name.  Josh Lucas?  Yeah.  And you were going to book...  No, no, he almost came in.  He approved him, but it was before the story.  You should book him for the confrontation.  No.  You don't like that?  Mm-mm.  You don't like the IGNs?  But I would hope that Anthony would learn...  Or forgive.  ...that the way people hurt his feelings on Twitter, and he feels he has to insult their  mother's sex lives, as he explained.  People hurt, too. 
[00:07:00]  I hurt, too, Anthony.  And I hope somewhere you're listening, although...  What did he tell you?  ...you're probably already at home asleep.  What did he tell you?  I told you.  He posted a screen cap on his phone that had my profile, and it said banned.  Like, he had banned me.  Or blocked.  Not blocked.  Blocked.  Whatever the...  But then he unblocked me and followed me, except he didn't tweet that he had unblocked  me.  He just let everybody laugh at the fact that I had been blocked, and then everybody else  started blocking me.  Did he follow you, send you a nasty private message, then unfollow you and block you? 
[00:07:30]  I just didn't know where all the venom was coming from.  I woke up this morning and saw it from the previous evening, and I didn't know where  the venom was coming from.  But I'm glad we're back on good terms.  Speaking of venom, E-Rock, you know firsthand, and Roland, you do too, that the ones I care  about are probably the ones I treat the worst.  Yes.  I mean, the ones that I have the most hurtful things to say, Eric.  Mm-hmm.  And those are the ones I care...  I like Eric.  I like Roland.  I say horrible, hurtful things about them.  You do?  This is like a speech from somebody else, but go ahead.  What?  A speech from who?  Oh. 
[00:08:00]  Opie?  Where you're standing.  You think Opie says that?  I think you're reciting word for word the same shit that he says when he's trying to,  uh...  Yeah, you know I like you, but, you know, fuck you.  No.  That's not what I was getting at.  Is that true?  Is it?  Opie Jr.?  He said that to you?  He said that to me?  He's never said that to me.  He treats me very well.  Oh, yeah, right.  He does.  For instance, when he named the show The Shit Hour, he treats me great.  And when I brought his son the Justin Bieber balloons, he said, what's wrong with him? 
[00:08:30]  Why would you bring his son's one-year-old?  Why would you bring him a Justin Bieber balloon?  He's a Bieber.  I guess that's good thinking.  But what I was getting at more was that Scorch is a guy who I care about.  Oh, God.  And all of a sudden, I treat him horribly, and then I'm surprised when he has nasty things  to say about me.  Hey, at least you got a shout-out.  You know, he's hurt in London.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's viewed.  It's TV.  It's 8 million homes.  How come he never mentions that anymore?  London?  A long time ago, you had some audio came in. 
[00:09:00]  He's talked about how his network is expanding, and he says, we're even going to be on in  London.  And then since that point, he's never mentioned London when he's talked about the 8 million  viewers that he has around the country.  Well, he probably feels like it's just unsaid now.  You'd think you'd want to promote that you're international more than you're just national.  You have 8 million homes in New Hampshire?  Are there 8 million homes in New Hampshire?  I seriously doubt it.  What type of ratings, Roland, did late-night shows usually get?  Um, Letterman, 4 million. 
[00:09:30]  So, they were right.  Like, Scorch is doing Leno combined with Letterman numbers.  Yeah, or Conan numbers, or, like, Fallon's a .7.  Almost a million.  Fallon's only got a million people watching?  Almost.  Almost.  Depends on the night.  And Scorch is doing how many?  8 million?  You don't like Scorch.  You don't like when they talk about Scorch.  I don't.  Why?  Like, watching paint dry.  What's wrong?  I mean, you don't think it's funny?  I just, he just annoys me.  There was one time in the office that, uh, Roland was curious and he pulled up PFG TV just to take a look. 
[00:10:00]  And Roland's just shaking his head.  He's like, I don't get this shit.  And just X's out of it.  Well, it's funny because it's so bad.  But it just angers me.  You don't like it.  By the way, Homestar Runner for you on feedback.  Um, well, what I was getting at was, there's one bit, I remember when I was working for Scorch in Syracuse.  That's where he came, you know, into my life.  I worked for him for a whole year in Syracuse before I was working here. 
[00:10:30]  And one day, we didn't have a lot of guests, believe it or not.  Rock 105 in Syracuse was not a hotbed for guests.  A million listeners?  That's right.  It was before the TV show.  So we didn't get a lot of guests.  Uh, but one morning, we find out that there's some kind of convention in town.  And we're getting the original Oompa Loompas in studio.  Yes.  The actors who played the Oompa Loompas.  E-Rock, you'd be excited to see the Oompa Loompas.  Nah, I don't care.  What do you mean you don't care?  You get pictures with people you don't even know who they are.  That's not true. 
[00:11:00]  It's not.  Nope.  You don't get pictures with UFC fighters you've never seen a fight in your life.  No, I've seen them fight.  I just don't follow any of their stuff.  Well, the, uh, the, what's it called?  The Oompa Loompas came in studio.  And at that point, I said to Scorch, you know, we could really get some exposure.  I'm sure Opie and Anthony would love to talk to these guys on the phone.  So we actually simulcasted.  It was me, Scorch, and his sidekick, Pauly, in studio with the Oompa Loompas simulcast  all the way to the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM. 
[00:11:30]  It was XM Radio at the time.  Were you raising your hand, E-Rock?  Yeah, I'll talk to you later.  Okay, um, so this is it.  It's from all the way back in 2005 when I was working with Scorch.  Just to bring you all on board, uh, we talked about Scorch today.  He gave us the shout-outs.  Listen to the replay at Eastern if you didn't hear it.  This is Scorch and the Oompa Loompas on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Uh, let's say hi to Scorch in Syracuse. 
[00:12:00]  What's up, boys?  The kingdom of, uh, nakedness.  It's the naked militia now, Opie.  No, it'll always be known as the kingdom of nakedness.  Naked militia.  He's upgraded.  What's up, guys?  Uh, are you, you're a hamburger.  No, you're pizza?  No, I'm pizza.  I was, you know, you're a hamburger.  Uh, you're the best pizza.  I've gone already.  I'm a hamburger.  Yeah, I think I might have been pizza, but they wanted burgers.  They wanted, uh, good.  But I was the best pizza man in the business.  Best pizza ever, but they wanted hamburgers. 
[00:12:30]  And you know what?  God damn it, I still am.  Scorch is a, uh, friend of the show and has always been a friend of the show.  Always been.  He wasn't an enemy that turned into a friend or a friend that turned into an enemy.  He's been a friend that continues to be a friend.  Yes.  That's nice.  Are you going to sing a Clarence Clemens song to me now?  Maybe you're a friend of mine.  Uh, I've got to...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Uh, Scorch does mornings in Syracuse.  Yeah, where are you, Scorch? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, keep going down the toilet after that.  Thanks.  Uh...  What station?  Uh, Rock 105, the dog.  The dog.  The dog.  Of course, the naked militia as well.  Sign up for that.  Talk to these Oompa Loompas, because they're very cool.  You got Oompa Loompas in the studio?  I've got the original Oompa Loompas, Malcolm and Rusty.  Are you sure they're real Oompa Loompas?  Because we know that, uh, there were a couple of imposters out there.  No, these guys are real.  Like Wizard of Oz midgets.  They run around saying that they're, uh, they're Wizard of Oz midgets when they're really 
[00:13:30]  not.  No, these guys are Oompa Loompas.  They are original, uh, Willy Wonka midgets, so, uh, why don't you talk to them, Shadu?  How old are they now?  How old are you guys?  Well, uh, good morning.  How are you?  Oh, they're from England.  My name is Rusty, and I was an original Oompa Loompa, and I'm just over 50 years of age,  and I've got Malcolm Dixon here.  Say hello.  Could you, um, could you, um, could you, could you, could you, could you sing us a piece  of the Oompa Loompa song?  Oh, that would be great.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oompa Loompa, doomp-a-dee-doo, I've got a perfect puzzle for you. 
[00:14:00]  Oompa Loompa, doomp-a-dee-dee, say hello to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  First segment, I think it's, oh, Scorch doesn't rhyme with Opie and Anthony.  I hated it.  I, I like, I thought it was kind of cute, because it was like, I actually had no idea you were  going to do that.  Um, so what do you guys do now, besides, like, just kind of, just tour and stuff like that?  Yeah, we're here for an event in Auburn at, uh, we're going to meet two munchkins, and 
[00:14:30]  Oh, there's still munchkins alive?  Yeah.  Yes.  Speaking of the munchkins, I gotta, uh, tell the gang here on our show, uh, David Spade's  new show on Comedy Central, Showbiz, he played some audio clips of the munchkins talking.  Yeah.  Holy shit, we gotta get the audio.  Really?  Yeah, they did a whole press tour where they were on GMA and all this.  Oh, are you guys, uh, live with us?  Uh, no, no, we ain't.  Oh, you had to dump out?  No, I didn't know we were, like, uh, simulcasting today, Scorch. 
[00:15:00]  You guys tell me.  Sorry, Scorch.  No, that's okay, what the fuck do I care?  No, you can't.  Oh, was that live just then?  I'm sorry, no.  All right, just tell us not to curse.  Are we live in Syracuse?  No, yeah, you are, but that's okay, go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry, you should have told me.  It's all good, what the hell, I don't have a license after today anyway.  Now, this is, you know, this is satellite radio, we can curse and stuff, that's why  satellite radio is much cooler than commercial radio.  That's why I'm coming to XM starting January.  Oh, did I let that slip out?  Whoa.  Are you really?  We'll talk. 
[00:15:30]  Anyway, what else is going on?  Talk to these guys.  I don't hope not.  What's that, Scorch?  We don't need the kingdom of nakedness on this fine platform.  Naked militia.  Naked militia?  You want to talk to, you want to talk to the Oompa Loompas?  Yeah, the Oompa Loompas, actually, we have a lot of people calling in that wanted to  talk with the Oompa Loompas, yes.  Wow, that's good.  Yeah, one of which, we got Steve, is that Steve?  Yeah, we got Steve on the phone.  We're national, so we're all over, and this call is coming from Yellowstone. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, he's a big fan of the movie, so let's talk to Steve, see if I can make this work  here.  Steve, you there?  Oh my God, hello?  Hi, are these guys really, are you guys imposters, or are you for real?  We are for real.  We are for real, and you can come and see us in over New York.  You can come and touch us if you like.  I am.  And I'm just talking to the chicks there.  I am actually a very big fan.  Oh my God, are you the only two Oompa Loompas, or are there more?  There are three guys that are still alive. 
[00:16:30]  Ramone!  And there's a young girl, in fact, she lives at a twilight home in England.  Ramone!  Kill these green-haired little savages!  Ramone!  Bring me a spoiled family photograph!  Ramone!  Ramone!  What about the orange fangs?  Ramone!  Ramone!  Drown these two like the Smith children!  Ramone!  Ramone!  Hey guys, I've got to bring me a singing piece of shit! 
[00:17:00]  I just arrived in Syracuse.  Steve!  I'm sorry.  Steve, I've got to apologize for Steve from Yellowstone.  He's very inappropriate, and he is not for broadcast radio with his language.  That's right.  Horrid.  Hey guys, I'm glad I can hook you up with the Oompa Loompas, but I've got to run and 
[00:17:30]  do a show and get no ratings.  Okay, Scorch.  We'll talk soon, man.  Ruined family photograph.  My favorite.  You can hear the panic in Scorch's voice.  We were definitely live.  Someone call Sam, our old intern for Scorch up there.  Let's see if we actually were live. 
[00:18:00]  Or maybe someone from Syracuse heard us.  Heard us on commercial radio.  I want to see if the curse has got over the air.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  You fucking kill me.  That is so funny.  Midgets are genetic disasters.  What was the last one?  He stepped on you. 
[00:18:30]  I know I said...  I think it started Ramon.  Bring me...  I know.  Bring me talking pieces of shit.  No, we got that one.  Oh, wait.  Ramon.  Yeah.  Bring me a spoiler.  Yes.  There was one about AIDS that I didn't quite...  Oh, of course.  Bolempus have AIDS?  Please.  Scorch is a pretty brave broadcaster.  You can hear the panic in his voice.  Yeah.  Because he decided to simulcast us today.  And those curses were going out.  Damn, is that funny.  Over the airwaves.  Hey, fuck it.  I don't know for a fact if it was simulcast. 
[00:19:00]  It's after O.B. and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  I was there on the other end.  On the Scorch end of that phone call.  So it wasn't quite the fun, jubilant time that everybody here in the O.B. and Anthony studio  had that day.  But one of my favorite moments for Scorch was when he...  And we quote him.  See, Travis and I, the one thing we can agree upon is that Ian Halperin and Scorch are  two of the greatest people to have ever walked the earth. 
[00:19:30]  And any time we have anything to do with those two on O&A, we're in heaven.  So, and we both love when Scorch did that little thing where he told O.B. and Anthony,  I'll be at XM in January.  And then said, oh, I let that slip.  We'll talk.  As if he didn't mean to say it.  That was in reference to January 2006.  I, from the time I met Scorch, every three months, he told me he was headed to XM. 
[00:20:00]  So when I met him in the, I met him first in the summer, he said, I'll probably be at  XM by Christmas.  Then he pushed it to January, then springtime, then summertime.  And he would make up these whole conversations.  He never...  E-Rock, you've been at XM longer than I have.  Yeah.  Was Scorch ever on XM?  I don't think Eric Logan knew Scorch until way later.  He insisted that he had multiple conversations with Kevin Straley.  Oh, yeah, I forgot about him.  No, I don't think that ever happened. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Do you think, did Scorch ever say, because you're saying he was supposed to come around  January 2006.  Six.  Do you think he ever said that he was going to take over for when Howard was leaving?  Like, before they announced David Lee Roth, do you think that he thought he was in the  running?  I mean, in his head, he might have.  I don't think he ever actually would have been, even in Syracuse.  I mean, he was gone by that point.  He was in New Hampshire by then, so, you know, I don't know. 
[00:21:00]  But you were also bringing up the...  Scorch getting these horrible guests and calling into Opie and Anthony was like, you thought  this was...  You were sitting in the studio talking to me while the bit was playing, and you thought  this was some next-level type of thinking.  Yeah, that he would book these, we'll say horrible guests, but on his show.  And then he would book himself on other shows.  Yeah.  So it's like, well, Scorch is going to come on, but he's bringing the Oompa Loompas.  So that would be sort of like a way of being syndicated, so he could just go on shows around 
[00:21:30]  the country, but have the guests on his show.  So he could claim both.  So he's just like an island where it is a show, but he also does other shows.  There's nothing exclusive about it.  Nothing at all.  But we're just going for listenership.  No, but then he can say he's been on all these major name programs, but then he's had  all these guests on his show.  Well, and he could also say, yeah, Opie and Anthony have done my show.  Because technically, you know, he's doing their show, but they're also doing his. 
[00:22:00]  It's a simulcast.  By the way, Eric, I talked to you about this yesterday when we were talking about your  Facebook status.  Okay.  I'm still blocked from your wall.  You shouldn't be.  I went and checked.  I'm blocked.  I can't see your wall on Facebook.  Both of your accounts should be fine.  There's no restrictions against you.  Well, I can't see your wall.  I checked today.  Speaking of Facebook, by the way, Troy, come in here for a second.  Because, I mean, I kind of, I owe you a what's up.  You do?  You can grab any of them.  I'll throw them all on.  That way, whatever's going on, we can hear it.  Cool.  Microphones, I mean.  I owe you a little what's up. 
[00:22:30]  Because, E-Rock, if you remember when you were talking to Troy on Facebook while you were  on vacation.  Oh, yeah.  They called you, and you were very pissed at them.  Yeah.  And you messaged Troy, and you wrote, fuck you.  Right?  That I did.  Okay.  And then, did you read Troy's status immediately after your conversation?  No, I didn't, because I signed off and then stopped looking at Facebook.  It said, gotta say, great O&A show today, with two exclamation points.  And I wasn't lying.  It was a great show.  You enjoyed that show. 
[00:23:00]  It was action-packed.  Top to bottom?  Top to bottom, start to finish.  What'd you think of the E-Rock segment?  I mean, it's arguably the best segment of the year.  Wow.  So far.  You felt that strongly.  And, uh, Sex Bagel, how does that make you feel?  Oh, look at Dilligaff Nagel.  Dilligaff Nagel, how does that make you feel?  You're not going by Dilligaff either?  Eric?  I didn't see that until this morning, and it took me a second to figure out what the acronym was, but, uh, no, don't care.  How does it make you feel that he believes that's the best bit of the year? 
[00:23:30]  So he thinks all his, uh, appearances on the show suck compared to mine.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, that was the best one.  In comparison, they do not hold a candle.  Uh, well, when he wrote about how great the O&A show was, he did that, he felt that way, but he also kind of did that as a favor to me.  Yeah.  That's just, like, what's up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Sam owes me a what's up.  So what were you going to, I mean, I heard His Highness Ian Halpern, we were just talking about Ian Halpern and Scorch, Ian Halpern was on on Friday.  Right.  And he mentioned that you are the best, or one of the best DJs in New York City. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, that was very kind of him to say that.  I didn't realize your skill level was that, uh, and he said you DJ on Tuesday nights.  Tuesday nights, 675 Bar.  Right.  That's in the Meatpacking District, and, uh, yeah.  There's your, there's your people.  All right.  Well, I gotta do some ideas.  675 Bar in the Meatpacking District?  Yeah.  Troy Kwan on Facebook and Twitter.  Okay.  Troy, you go do, he's gonna cut liners with, Roland, he has to go cut liners, right? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  He's gotta do IDs and stuff.  Oh, no, we're not.  He's not gonna cut him yet?  Yeah, he came in and stuff.  Oh, okay, so he's got time.  Okay, Troy's cutting IDs with, uh, Greckenmeyer and Zach Morris.  Roland, you just gonna walk around in here and grab a mic, you know?  Hang out.  Roland's confused, I'm confused, we don't know what we're doing here.  Well, you're gonna have to cut the, but it's good that you're in here, because, uh,  Troy, today's a big anniversary for you.  Is it?  Not to the exact day, but around this day, right, Iraq?  Um, I think, no, I think it was to the exact day. 
[00:25:00]  It was the exact, what'd you say, Roland?  Wait, wait, Troy Kwan's gonna DJ tonight.  He just said that.  Where at?  6-7-5-Bar.  Yeah.  6-7-5-Bar, that's awesome.  He just mentioned that.  Well, I'm just saying, again, 6-7-5-Bar.  You can plug it four times, if you've heard it already.  I'm sorry.  Um.  6-7-5-Bar.  Troy, today's a one-year anniversary for you.  Oh, yeah, 6-7-5-Bar, he's been DJing there for one year.  Oh, boy.  What, uh, I don't know, what is it?  Well, uh, it was one year ago today.  What happened in 2010? 
[00:25:30]  Uh, this time, I don't know.  Do you remember, uh, we had interns a year ago today.  Oh.  I just started to, that wasn't a happy oh.  Well, I know, I know where we're going with this.  But yeah, yeah, I have a, a rough idea of what, what the universe is.  Because one year ago today, you walked into this studio to talk about your date with then-intern Sean's girlfriend.  Yes.  I mean, you told intern Sean that, uh, this was, he was a very effeminate young man. 
[00:26:00]  Yep.  Uh, he really let his girlfriend whip him around.  Questionable sexuality.  Uh, he took a liking to both me and you that by the end of his semester, we both felt very uncomfortable with.  Still do.  All your bits with, with, uh, the intern and Sam in studio involved Sam with his shirt off.  No, no, no, I wouldn't take my shirt off.  I never did.  I thought you did.  I never took my shirt off.  You and this intern, Sean, ended up with a shirtless hug.  But you told him, if you introduce me to your girlfriend, I'm going to have sex with her. 
[00:26:30]  Did he?  Troy, now that the bit's over, it's been a year, there wasn't a whole lot of resolution.  It's probably been mentioned here and there.  We're about to play this, though.  Did you end up having sex with this girl?  I absolutely did, yes.  You did, you did.  Yes is the answer.  Yeah.  But, let me, let me also say that he was not an intern here at that time.  Because I had waited a couple weeks.  Wait, it's his girlfriend anyway.  No, I had waited a couple weeks.  And I had also said to him, I'm hanging out with your chick.  And he was like, yeah, I'm totally cool with that. 
[00:27:00]  Of course, you're like a big, like, man who's like in his 30s.  Early 30s, but 30s nonetheless.  33.  Well, okay, so early to mid 30s.  Thank you for correcting me.  And he's this sort of weak-willed, you know, feminine, bony 20-something.  So, you probably just said, yo, I'm going to go fuck your chick.  And he was like, no, I was like, yeah, I'm hanging out with your chick.  And he's like, yeah, it's fine, whatever.  Well, before we run out of time, we should at least get a little bit of this in to celebrate.  This is, uh...  Did you take it to the 675 Bar after you, Banger? 
[00:27:30]  No, I did not.  It wasn't a Tuesday night.  The club wasn't hopping unless it's Tuesday.  Oh, I apologize.  675 Bar in the Meatpacking District.  This is Troy Kwan and his date with our intern's girlfriend on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Troy, did you go out with her?  First of all, you're very kind.  You threw me a couple bucks to take her out.  Yeah, you know, I figured what the hell.  And I tried to give it back at the end of the show.  He's like, no, go ahead.  No, no.  300 clams.  Wow.  That's right.  Well, you know, I want it to be a nice dinner.  You know, that'll buy a lot of shrimp. 
[00:28:00]  Impress.  Get that girl some shrimps.  Get some shrimps.  Maybe let her get her herded.  Did she get her herded?  So, anything transpired?  So, I hit her up on Facebook and we went out to this restaurant.  She had a great time.  Was it nice?  A nice place?  It was great.  I took her where the real players go.  All right.  The Brazilian Steakhouse.  Yes.  Very good.  Fantastic.  She had a great time.  She said she wanted South Americans.  So, we went with that.  She had a great time. 
[00:28:30]  Great conversation.  What position is that?  So, give me South American.  All right.  Flip over.  Yes.  That's a good rogery while my boyfriend cries.  Roger.  But, yeah.  Really good conversation.  Had a good time.  Did you finger her under the table?  No.  I did not, unfortunately.  But, uh, just went into, like, uh, the relationship with Sean and he's got this really bizarre fascination  with me.  He thinks that we're linked together in different ways. 
[00:29:00]  We're both from Allentown, Pennsylvania.  We both live in the same neighborhood.  Close in all the factories.  He went through all of these different ways that we're connected with each other.  And it kind of freaked me out a little bit.  Well, how long have you been out of Allentown?  For, uh, four years.  This is not going to end with a murder-suicide.  No.  No, exactly.  It's, wow.  So, that's why I'm just kind of freaked out.  You know what I mean?  Where he's, he's telling her we have these weird connections.  And I'm just kind of freaked out at this point.  But, you know, we had a good time regardless.  Connection.  So, you go out, uh, did she, uh, did she eat, like, sloppily or anything? 
[00:29:30]  I like, I like how, you know, you gotta look at a girl and see how she, how she handles  herself eating.  Was she shoveling food in her mouth?  Like, she takes sausages eight at a time and just swallows them whole.  Yeah.  She's a good girl.  Pushes the back of her head down on her food.  Yeah, she leaves egg salad on her lips.  Oops.  No, you know, she was trying to eat real proper.  We both were like, ah, fuck it.  And then we started, you know, they have, like, onion rings and french fries.  Well, so you got comfortable with each other pretty quickly.  Right.  Uh, you're, you're having a, yes, Sam.  And Troy said that he found out at dinner that she plays the drums, as does he. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  We already have things in common.  Yeah.  So you have some things in common musically.  Yeah, we hit it off really well.  Yeah, she's a cool chick.  Yeah, that sounds, uh, that sounds pretty cool.  And now, now, the problem is your, your ex was having a guy over the house?  Yes.  So now you had no place to go.  Well, we'll, we'll get there.  Hang on a second.  All right.  All right.  Yes.  Very good.  Troy's coming there.  Allie's.  So.  That means he's got confidence in, in what he's got to tell us today. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  All right.  I respect that.  So, uh, had a couple, she's under 21.  She's only 20.  Yeah.  So it really slings down what you can do.  You know what I mean?  Does it?  Really?  Well, to go anywhere in the city, cool, you gotta be 21.  So I had a couple other options.  I wouldn't know that.  And, uh, we decided to head over to the Blue Note, the jazz club downtown, and, uh, watch  the band play.  We were there.  Scooby-oo-wah.  Yeah.  It was cool.  Like a, like a jazz funk band.  It was fun.  Yeah.  So she's into that kind of thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had like a real kind of hipster night out. 
[00:31:00]  A gentleman evening.  That's like a gentleman taking a girl.  Hey, you know, like here's a girl 20 years old, used to Sean taking her out to fucking  Friendly's.  Friendly's.  Well, well, well, and, and, yeah.  I know where you're going, and I, I, Jimmy, would, if you went out with her, where would  you have taken her?  You know, I know the restaurant he went to.  That's a good place.  Yeah.  But would you do the same?  Nah, I would have my dick out, like, right after dinner, and I would probably wreck it.  But he's, Troy's a smart guy.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, you make it a whole evening.  You go out for some whatever, and this way.  You wouldn't have, you wouldn't have patience to make it a whole evening.  I would wreck it.  I would wreck it.  Yeah, yeah.  I would literally just go, how fat's your pussy?  And she would get up and leave.  After ONA Live.  We do more, but we don't have time.  I guess the Ron and Fez show has to start.  We never have time.  I know.  Look.  With all the changes, is this show going to expand?  I'm not saying a word.  Things can happen, though, Eric.  Things can happen.  And by the way, somebody feedbacking in, Dilligaf Nagel, does it look like I give away food? 
[00:32:00]  You've got to give him credit for that.  Oh, no, I don't.  Oh, poor.  Listen, we haven't, it's been running in promos, but there's a big contest going on from Poconos  Raceway.  It's going to be a very fun contest.  It's the Physical Fitness Challenge.  You don't actually have to participate in the Physical Fitness Challenge.  You go to SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  You enter the contest.  And then you're going to come on the air with us.  Maybe.  I don't know if you are or not. 
[00:32:30]  But either way, even if you're not, you're going to get attached to a representative.  Now, names that have been thrown around have included E-Rock and Roland.  Much to their chagrin.  Somebody's mentioned a Bobo.  Somebody's mentioned, you know, an intern, David.  We don't know.  We're going to have two representatives in this Physical Fitness Challenge.  I think.  Either two or four.  Probably two representatives in this Physical Fitness Challenge.  You get attached to them and the winner gets something unbelievable. 
[00:33:00]  You've got to go to SiriusXM.com slash the virus to get all the info.  So, somebody just won $2,000 from Steven Singer because of the most annoying 30 seconds.  This one's even easier because you don't have to create a 30 seconds.  All you have to do is enter.  Again, SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  They have the email and all that.  I'll talk to you a little more about it tomorrow.  I hope Ronnie's okay because I've been missing him the past couple days. 
[00:33:30]  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  And Opie and Anthony.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, we'll be back tomorrow.  Good day.  Opie and Anthony Show is now over.  For real this time.
