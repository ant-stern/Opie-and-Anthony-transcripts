<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony, joined by Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jim Norton, complaining about their Monday morning blues. Opie recounted a violent encounter with his alarm clock.  The hosts then critiqued "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," lamented NFL blackouts preventing them from watching the Patriots game (forcing them to endure the Jets instead), and discussed the Patriots' cheating scandal.  A significant portion featured listener-submitted remixes of their producer Steve's sounds, described as bizarre and irritating, incorporated into popular songs.  They also discussed unusual Guinness World Records, including "greatest distance thrown in a car accident," which led to a conversation about surviving plane crashes and high-altitude falls. A caller shared a story about meeting Henry Height, allegedly the world's tallest man, which the hosts mocked.  The Steve remixes returned as a closing topic.

A substantial segment focused on the upcoming presidential election and Barack Obama's candidacy.  The discussion, involving Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal, was heavily race-based, using racial slurs and stereotypes. They debated whether Obama's popularity stemmed from his race, criticizing his perceived "phoniness" and comparing him unfavorably to Bill Clinton and George Bush. The conversation broadened to include black and white politicians, cultural differences between black and white communities, and Oprah Winfrey's image management.  They also touched upon Tim Tebow's NFL prospects and, with frequent interruptions and comedic riffing, discussed movies like *I Am Legend*, with movie reviewer Roland providing commentary.  Patrice O'Neal promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.

A movie review segment featured Roland sharing his top ten films of the year.  His #1 pick, "Once," was heavily ridiculed due to its musical genre. Other movies discussed included "The Savages," "3:10 to Yuma," "There Will Be Blood," "Gone Baby Gone," "Superbad," "Beowulf," "Juno," "No Country for Old Men," and "The Bucket List." A caller's positive "Once" review was further mocked.  Later, a prolonged, sexually suggestive interaction occurred between Patrice O'Neal, the hosts, and a woman from the audience.  Patrice coaxed the woman into partially disrobing on camera, to the hosts' and Patrice's visible excitement. The conversation focused on the woman's compliance, her boyfriend's potential reaction, her submissive tendencies, and the hosts' sexual interest in her.

A later segment featured Patrice O'Neal recounting a detailed and explicit story of a threesome. He described the other woman's enthusiastic participation and sexual prowess.  The conversation shifted to Anthony's severe JÃ¤germeister-induced hangover, involving vomiting and sleeping in a bar bathroom.  Listeners called in with their own threesome and hangover experiences.

The show's final segment delved into the hosts' and guests' experiences with alcohol and drugs, transitioning into a discussion of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Anthony recounted a hand injury from slamming shots. They discussed various substances and the experience of sobriety among drunk people. Anthony revealed past cocaine dealing and his current law-abiding status, detailing a Friday party with excessive drinking and a 73-year-old woman making out with a guest. Sam, with a prominent afro, and E-Rock, initially intended to promote a WWE Raw event, were present. E-Rock's reluctance to make the drive became a recurring joke.  Anthony described his Call of Duty 4 gameplay in detail, including online interactions with players like Bob Kelly. Several callers shared their experiences.  The show concluded with line-of-the-day announcements, further WWE promotion discussion, and closing remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shock, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 to my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick, freaks. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like a transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  On the road. 
[00:01:30]  What?  Is it really Monday?  What's that mean?  How does that vaudevillian saying still apply?  Get the show on the road.  Yes, it is Monday.  Hi.  I was sitting here like just two, three minutes ago.  Yeah.  Do you remember?  Do you remember two or three minutes ago when I was telling you?  I'm getting ready to turn the mics on.  And I turned to Anthony and I turned to Patrice O'Neal, who's sitting in for Jim Norton today.  And I said, wow. 
[00:02:00]  I don't feel like doing this today.  Some days, especially on Mondays, you're kind of sluggish from the weekend.  You're feeling a little woozy, a little groggy.  When you get through it, you're into it.  For some reason, I just want to go home and go right back to bed.  Well, the bed thing is definitely, you know, that's in the back of your head like every Monday.  Yeah.  I think with everybody.  But I slept.  That doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  You still just want to go back to bed. 
[00:02:30]  I had a fight with my alarm clock this morning.  I literally had a fist fight with my alarm clock.  Did you hold it by the base and just bop it?  No, I was beating the crap out of the top of it, and then I punched the front of it.  And it wasn't because it was going off.  I know what it does.  It's his job.  It's to wake me up.  I understand.  But I have the worst alarm clock.  I don't know how it really works.  It's a mystery to me.  It's set, and it goes off, and I know how to shut it off. 
[00:03:00]  But as far as setting it or everything else, there's too much of a wacky combination of buttons on top of it.  So sometimes when I go to shut it off and I'm groggy, I'll hit one of these mystery buttons, and all of a sudden, I'm getting a countdown from 19.  What?  From 19 minutes.  It's like a countdown display.  What does that do?  I don't know.  So I hit a few more buttons, and now I'm resetting the time, the time the alarm goes off, the days that it goes off, because it's set to go off at, like, 4 o'clock every Monday through Friday. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So then I'm hitting it, and now it's going to go off on Sunday and only Sunday, and all the rest of the days of the week were wiped out.  And then the snooze kept going off, so I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth, and the snooze goes off.  So I go in and hit it, and finally I just had to say, baby, the alarm is broke.  You've got to do something about it, because I don't know how it works. 
[00:04:00]  Like, so I woke her up, and...  You should just throw it away.  I want that thing gone so badly.  I want a simple alarm clock that you don't have to press 18 different buttons and move the...  And then I sound like a retard when I talk to my girlfriend.  I'm like, um, how do you set this?  Oh, you push this two button and then hit that and hit the thing on the side five times, and they go...  No, I want to set it for a time and have it go off every day at that time with no problems, no big hassles. 
[00:04:30]  It was a pain in the ass.  I swear I was ready to yank it out of the wall and do one of those Australian bolo weapons that they use to catch ostrich with around the legs.  Just whip it across the room.  Every once in a while, I'll just, like, pull out the plug and just throw the whole thing in the garbage and start over.  Yeah, start anew.  That's what I need.  And for years, I had one of those stupid wind-up ones, because the blackouts would always get me... 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  ...make me late.  But then I can't sleep to...  Oh, you can hear that crap.  It's like, well, can't they make a wind-up alarm clock that doesn't tick like it's 1860?  I got my old reliable.  What's that?  The alarm on my BlackBerry.  Well, I do the iPhone.  I have three alarms set for the morning.  Very good.  Set each one five minutes apart.  But I have a Bose that Super Agent Bob Eatman gave us a couple of Christmases ago or whatever.  And, you know, during the daylight, when you're wide awake, you're like, oh, alarm off. 
[00:05:30]  Boop!  You got it all figured out.  Uh-huh.  But something happens when you wake up at 4.20 in the morning.  Like, I guess your brain is only, like, 20% functioning.  Of course.  So all of a sudden you hit a button, kind of going down the same road you are right now.  Yep.  You hit a button, all of a sudden, like, the radio blasts on.  And then you try to turn the radio off.  And all of a sudden, a CD that you happen to have in the thing starts playing.  Like, how do I just want this?  And then you do turn it off.  And like you just said, you're in the bathroom.  And then another... 
[00:06:00]  Another alarm goes off.  Like, the snooze goes off.  Or alarm three or four goes off.  And you're like, oh, now you got to stop what you're doing, go in there.  The girl's awake now.  Yeah.  She's mad because you're a retard when it comes to your alarm.  Yeah.  There's no reason for it.  Because like you said, when you first wake up in the morning, your mind is not at 100% capacity.  You can't figure things out.  You need the simplest thing.  I need, like, a light-up red button.  A button that just lights up, hit this, and this shuts off. 
[00:06:30]  And that's it.  I don't need little tiny buttons with text on it that I can't read because it's still dark out.  It's ridiculous.  Well, we're here, though.  Yeah.  Made it.  For another fine Opie and Anthony show with Patrice O'Neill.  I saw that dumb extreme makeover.  I guess that's what we watch now every Sunday.  Really?  And I get all freaking...  Is that your show?  Is that your program?  I have to watch my program.  You watch Extreme Makeover where they come in and, like, they help people and they build 
[00:07:00]  a house in a week and...  I just see the commercials and it's enough.  And they start screaming, move that bus!  Move that!  And then the bus...  That's what they screamed in Selma.  Jesus Christ.  And then the bus moves and then...  That's the first one of the day.  And then the family...  Just from the week.  And then the family is crying and they fall on the ground and then I'm on my stupid couch  and I get, like, a little worked up.  Because of this dumb show.  I don't know, man.  It gets to me for some dumb reason.  It gets you all emotional.  Why does that do it?  And do they keep paying the house taxes for you? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  They do, though.  Do they?  They pay the mortgage and everything.  They don't mess around.  You live in that house for free for the rest of your life.  They don't mess around, man.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I bet there's a time limit.  You're on your own.  If I was...  Taxes.  If I was the people, because now they're living in, like, a million dollar home, I would just,  like, sell it immediately.  That doesn't make any sense.  And then downsize.  Downsize.  And then you have a lot of money to live with.  Yeah.  They said people would get mad at the price is right because they wouldn't pay the tax.  The people couldn't get the car sometimes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of times they give away the car, but you're responsible for the tax. 
[00:08:00]  Like, I can't pay.  It's all right.  Man.  We get the car, then screw you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what sucks about game shows.  You're absolutely right.  When you win merchandise.  If you win cash, you know, it comes out of that.  Or even when they start talking about these great trips to Hawaii or the Bahamas or Australia  or whatever.  You're liable for all those taxes.  You have to pay those taxes.  So most of those people that are on those game shows, they can't afford the taxes.  So they end up making a deal with the game show company and they never go on those  great trips or get the car or the boat or whatever. 
[00:08:30]  And the company gets its advertising, so they don't care.  They don't have to come up with the trip or the merchandise.  It's just amazing.  But anyway, big weekend for football.  And you know what?  And I hate the NFL and their stupid rules.  Patrice and I were just talking about this.  I'm at my brother's joint.  FH Riley's in Huntington there.  What's the field goal?  I hate that, too.  The field goal is ridiculous.  You're not a football fan, right?  No, I'm not a football fan, but I know the game.  Right, right, right.  I know the game. 
[00:09:00]  And when something exciting is happening any season, like the Pats, I'll keep track now.  I'll keep an eye on them.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm at FH at the bar and the Jets game is on.  And I'm like, and I'm a Jets, you know, I was brought up a Jets fan.  And I'm sitting there like, who wants to see the Jets?  Yeah.  What are they?  Three and nine?  I don't even know at this point, right?  So I'm like, all right, let's watch the Pats.  And I already knew the answer to this.  I don't even know why I tried. 
[00:09:30]  So I start searching for the Pats game.  Of course it's blacked out here in New York.  Of course it is.  Why would they do that?  I'm like, why do we have to sit and watch a team that has no effing hope this year?  They black it out because they know you're not going to be watching the Jets.  I was in pain.  I was in pain, too, Patrice.  I woke up at 12.  I was happy.  You don't even know how happy I was yesterday.  And I woke up at 12 just relaxing.  I made pancakes.  I went to the store, got pancake battered.  Wow.  And frozen blueberries.  I was ready to go. 
[00:10:00]  Come 4-15, I'm searching for the Patriots.  It's like, what's going on?  And that regional and new.  That regional garbage.  Jets and the Giants.  I know there's fans out there, whatever.  But they are the two worst teams to watch.  They're the most boring team.  Even the Miami Dolphins are more exciting losing.  Oh, yeah.  Than watching the Jets and Giants.  Dude, I would watch every Dolphins game from now until the end of the season.  Just to watch them try and lose is better. 
[00:10:30]  The Giants sickens me.  Eli Manning sickens me.  Yeah.  So they got the regional blackout.  And I can't watch the Pats game.  And they're showing unbelievable highlights during the boring Jets game.  And I'm like, I just want to see the game.  I want to see Tom Brady throw 150-yard touchdown passes from the stands.  Mistake laterals.  Mistakes.  Mistakes.  And they get, here you go, Tom.  Do what you do best. 
[00:11:00]  Mistake lateral.  They threw a 60-yard mistake lateral bomb to somebody.  And every time they scored, it was on this big-mouthed dude from Pittsburgh who was saying how you should score.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he guaranteed a win.  He guaranteed a victory.  Oh, he sure did.  And, oh, my God, right down his throat.  How could they possibly show the Jets in Cleveland?  How?  Thank you, Patrice.  How?  Like, whatever fine you had to pay for showing.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Just pay the fine. 
[00:11:30]  Just sneak it on.  Instead, it was something like infomercial or something.  Instead of the pass game here in New York, which was exciting, and Brady just ripped it up again.  There was some dumb, like, yeah, they were selling something.  Something stupid, I think.  That's awful.  The Jets are 3-10, and you're blacking out the pass game?  Hey, no one was at the Jets game.  Right.  Look at the film.  Who came to the Jets game?  Really empty.  No one.  The hardcore fans weren't even at the Jets game.  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a hardcore Jets fan. 
[00:12:00]  I take a peek.  I like my Jets.  They were home looking for New England on TV.  Right.  They wanted to watch New England.  Yeah, they're all flipping around their TVs going, what the hell is going on?  They're teasing us with just amazing plays.  I'm like, holy crap.  And they all were good.  They all were bombs.  There was not one boring touchdown like yesterday.  No offense to Cleveland, but Jets, Browns, when we could be watching the Pats and the Steelers?  Offense to Cleveland.  No one cares.  Offense.  Offense to those UPS uniforms. 
[00:12:30]  Look, look, I understand.  That team stinks.  I understand the regional blackout rule, whatever, whatever the hell it's officially called.  But if your team is under 500, that should just be done.  That's it.  Throw all the games on.  I wonder if anybody would have complained and said, what's the Jets game, man?  Yeah.  How many people would have complained?  What is this Pittsburgh trying to destroy history?  We're watching history being made twice with the worst team ever and the best team ever. 
[00:13:00]  And people don't remember that the Patriots was 1-15 one time.  They was like 14-0 or something like that.  13-0 for the Pats right now.  I mean, 0-15 rather.  Oh, they won their last game of the season.  They were awful at one year.  Yeah.  And they're going for the 16-0.  And Miami was the only undefeated team in history that went 14-0.  And now they are.  And they're looking to go 0-16.  And those old bums from the 72 Dolphins do nothing but root against anybody who wants 
[00:13:30]  to try to make their record.  And Mercury Morris, who's 95 years old, does raps.  He goes, nobody can.  You can only be undefeated if you go undefeated.  Like, it's old school what old black people, how they rap, how they think rap is.  Let me tell you something.  You got to win the game to be undefeated.  Like, and he said it started and ended with Curtis Blow. 
[00:14:00]  It's a Curtis Blow type of rap.  It's very Curtis Blow-y.  And he definitely.  Fab Five Freddy.  That's how he wants to be remembered.  He's going to kill himself if the Patriots.  And at the same time, Miami go 0-16.  That's what kind of year it is.  And someone's trying to beat me up on instant feedback.  They can't punch you through there.  Don't you worry.  Don't worry, Opie.  Next week, everyone can watch the Jets lose.  Let me tell you something.  I want the Jets to lose to the Pats.  Absolutely.  Who could root against a team that might break a... 
[00:14:30]  We're living.  This is a great story.  The Jets beat the Pats.  Who gives a crap?  I'd rather see the Pats go undefeated.  At this point.  Absolutely.  Yes.  I would like to see that happen.  I was three years old when the last undefeated team in history played.  What do you think happens, though?  Do they start sitting Brady?  I ask...  No way.  No way.  First of all...  They've got to go for it, right?  They're going to beat the Jets because they're really the ones that unleashed this problem  on the league.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  With his snitching.  Yeah.  They're going to beat them 97. 
[00:15:00]  It should be...  It's going to be like 97-3.  A 46...  And the three is going to be a 60-yard field goal.  That is just lucky.  He's going to...  He's going to...  The wind just happens to kick up in time.  They're going to destroy the Jets.  They're going to beat the Jets to death just because...  I was embarrassed for...  You know, kind of a Jets fan.  I was embarrassed when they were the ones that were, you know, telling on the Pats.  We brought this up.  Every team does it.  But the Jets decided to call out the Pats like that on cheating.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:15:30]  Mancini and Belichick have a problem.  Right.  But no one...  I didn't see anyone when this happened.  I kind of remember.  It was weird.  But no one to the man and to the woman cared.  Like, they go, are you joking me?  Did he...  Everybody does that.  It's like stealing...  Somebody made the analogy of stealing.  It's like stealing the baseball sign, the signals.  Yeah, yeah.  Things you do.  Everybody does it.  They do it so much that now the coaches cover their mouth. 
[00:16:00]  You see them?  They'll cover their mouth with the book and be like, you know, left, right, right, left.  That's what I need to do.  That's what you do.  You need an edge.  It's like it's either that or steroids.  Yeah.  It's steroids and then it trickles down.  You have to cheat.  And Mancini snitched and that's what he gets.  Because he had promise from last year.  Absolutely.  You go, oh, they're going to be good.  He snitched and made them say, well, he beat us because he snitched.  Really?  Now people are going to get 56 to 1. 
[00:16:30]  Now the Pats are punishing the league.  Destroying everybody.  Thanks to Mancini.  And Belichick has everybody just under some type of hypnosis.  So I watched the Pats game through my BlackBerry getting freaking updates.  So I couldn't find, I couldn't find, what is it, NFL Network or Dish Network, any of that crap.  It was too late.  It was too late to search that out.  It was ridiculous, dude.  I couldn't believe, I was so hurt because I had four hours of happiness, like four hours of giddy waiting to watch this game. 
[00:17:00]  Yes!  And then they pull it out from under you.  To get to the two ugliest uniforms.  They didn't even play, it wasn't even somebody.  They didn't even play in their good uniforms.  It wasn't even like old school San Diego uniforms versus, who got a good looking, like the Panthers.  Right.  At least it should have been colorful and happy.  It was a disgusting, dreary game with dreary uniforms.  I would love to know the ratings for the Jets game yesterday.  Was it really worth it to black out the pass? 
[00:17:30]  Point two.  Point two.  I think they should have a recap of the Heisman Trophy.  It got more ratings.  There were 57 people watching in the tri-state area.  Hey, football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Travis, myself, and Than all tied with six wins.  Wow.  So we got what?  We got a game tonight?  Yep.  Yeah, we got a game tonight to see who wins this week's football pool.  But yeah, that was downright depressing.  It was, dude.  I couldn't see that game.  It was depressing. 
[00:18:00]  And what they showed to take the, I would have rather seen Circus Stole or whatever that  is than to see the Jets in Cleveland.  Yeah, it's where you live.  That's what you were tortured with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should be able to choose whatever you want.  I guess you can.  People have satellite packages, though, right?  Yeah.  They can watch whatever the hell they want, right?  He got direct, but I got Comcast, and they don't have a football package.  Yeah.  So I would have bought the football package to be able to see who I need to see play.  Yeah.  But see, I don't, like, week after week, I personally don't like to jump around to a 
[00:18:30]  million games.  I don't really care that much.  Right, right, right.  But yesterday, I did care.  Of course.  The one time I did care, you know, I was screwed out.  And I was mad at Baltimore for getting pummeled yesterday after they gave the Patriots a scare.  Right.  How dare you?  How dare you?  It was 44 to 20, but it was 44 to 7 in the fourth quarter.  And then all of a sudden, the guy's like, ah.  Yeah.  And everybody went to sleep.  Yeah.  Let them score a couple times.  Who cares?  After they almost beat the Patriots, they just gave up. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  After the guy probably poked somebody's eyes out with the flag.  And people didn't notice, I was talking to my boy about the referee flags, why it was  such a big deal.  The referee flags have, like, a bowling ball inside of it.  Like, it's not just like, here's a flag, everyone.  It's some iron.  Some dude from Cleveland lost his career.  Yeah, it hit him in the eye, right?  Because the referee just threw, and hit the bowling ball from the flag, hit him in his eye.  And he went blind in one eye.  When they throw those things now, everyone ducks. 
[00:19:30]  And they wait for it to land.  So the dude could have killed somebody when he threw that flag.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We're just getting started.  We got Patrice O'Neal, and we got to talk about Oprah and Obama.  Yep.  We got lots to do, actually.  Omentum, baby.  Omentum.  Yeah.  O-N-O.  They were calling it O-N-O.  O-N-O Connection.  The O-N-O Connection.  She's evoking the words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. 
[00:20:00]  All right, Ann.  I know you're chomping at the bit.  We'll talk about it after the break.  Also, a couple weird things.  I ripped out a couple articles from the paper yesterday.  This guy holds a world record, an amazing world record.  That's all I'm going to say right now.  Oh!  It's not like the fattest human, the tallest human, a dude that ate, you know, a hundred  eggs or whatever.  This is amazing.  This one, yeah, most records I could give a crap about, but the new Guinness Book of World  Records came out, and this one is quite impressive. 
[00:20:30]  Can anyone break it, you think?  Let me just put it this way.  If someone wants to look for a better record than this today from the Guinness Book of World  Records, God bless you if you can find one better than the one I hold in my hand.  If you like train, can you break it?  Huh?  If you're trained, can you break it?  No.  There's no breaking this record.  No, it's one of these things where you're just going about your life and it happens.  And this guy officially has the record for this thing.  Right.  And I don't think there's a better record out there that's more interesting than this 
[00:21:00]  one right here.  Okay?  Okay.  I'll tell you after the break.  Damn, I hate to wait.  And then the other thing I brought in was the dudes in the Philippines cutting out their  kidneys.  Yeah.  To make a few bucks.  I thought this was like urban legend.  And the picture on the paper yesterday was amazing.  The Philippine dudes were just all lined up with a massive scar where their kidney used  to be.  We'll talk about that after the break.  Selling them.  Yeah, we got lots to do.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  Hey.  Good morning to you and yours.  It's effing Monday.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  We'll get through it, though.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  So I guess the Guinness Book of World Records came out.  Yeah.  I used to read that book as a kid.  Everyone loved it.  It was one of those staples, one of those things everybody had.  A good book to have by the churlite.  Yeah, I used to find it fascinating.  And then it got to like, I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  Like, I don't know.  What am I trying to say?  It did change because it was kind of fun to read.  I know what I'm trying to say.  They got rid of the freak angle.  The Guinness Book of World Records when we were growing up had a lot of freaky things in  there.  Biggest face.  Biggest face, smallest girl, longest fingernails, all that freakish crap.  Biggest face woman.  Yeah.  Biggest face man.  Biggest face man. 
[00:22:30]  Heaviest pituitary gland.  Deepest voice.  And I think the PC police, I think they kind of got to the Guinness Book of World Records  and they're like, look, you can't have a record for biggest face.  I'm sorry, but you just can't.  Your face is huge.  Right.  Biggest face.  That's funny.  The PC police.  Biggest face.  Right.  You can't have no face woman.  Why?  With a weird picture.  Right.  It's a real weird picture.  They're like, it is always in India. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Somebody with the biggest something is in India.  The guy's always with the fingernails.  Yeah.  He was an Indian guy and stuff.  Yeah.  It's always in India.  Biggest face is in India.  The guy with the biggest face.  How do you even measure that?  Some Calamite.  So now their records are like, you know, I don't know, world record for eating hard  boiled eggs and just dump stuff.  It's awful.  Yeah.  It's got to be like healthy stuff that the children won't try to reproduce. 
[00:23:30]  I want biggest face.  I want the world record for biggest face.  We got to start a campaign.  A little as feet.  Yeah.  Tiny people that fit in cabinets.  You know, records for mistake is a mistake.  Like, you know, the guy bumped into the most going into the train station 700 times.  Yeah.  Really good.  Yeah.  It's not a record.  They used to have like just horrific birth defects and then they would call them records. 
[00:24:00]  Some nine foot guy.  But they had to measure him like he was hunched over like a cocktail shrimp.  They had to like measure him with like a rope because he's all bent up, but he's like 10  feet tall.  Yeah.  He only stands about 6'4", but if you stretch the bastard out, he's 10'2".  If you stretch the bastard out, if you stretch him out, he's 18 feet tall.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  That's what I miss from the world records.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That was the good stuff.  Now they got longest leg hair.  You know, come on.  That's stupid.  And how long is the hair?  Like four inches or so?  Who cares?  But anyway.  Some of the records aren't even records.  They're like stunts.  Like a stunt.  They did have freaks though.  Remember that?  Yeah.  I liked it.  I mean, the ones where the two fat guys on the minibike, the brothers.  You know, you can tell though that it's weaker because the book is beautiful now. 
[00:25:00]  Back in the day, the Guinness Book of World Wrestling used to be an arrogant book.  It looked like a dictionary.  Yeah.  It wasn't exciting.  Yep.  No color pictures.  It was just.  Yeah.  You would go, wow.  Now they have this amazing looking.  It's very glossy.  Yeah.  And you move and it moves.  Ah, that's crap.  It almost has like pop-up features.  Yeah.  When we were growing up and the Guinness Book of World Records came out, you had to go  to like the back of the library or the back of the bookstore.  Like, hey, I want that book.  And they weren't proud of the display.  It's like, oh, you freak. 
[00:25:30]  Here you go.  Yeah.  It was a mess.  But now it's like front and center in every bookstore.  And it was bigger than the New Testament.  Yeah.  It was just huge.  It was real thick.  Now it's just like, it's a cocktail.  What do they call it?  A cocktail table?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Table book.  It's just whack.  It's like, as you go in, this is not exciting.  No.  It stinks.  Coffee table book.  That was it.  Yeah.  It was awful.  But the one I remember all the time is the littlest people.  Yeah.  And they call them dwarfs. 
[00:26:00]  They didn't call them little people.  No, midgets, dwarfs.  There's no little people.  No political correctness there.  Littlest midget.  It's a fidget.  So, but this record.  This was in the paper yesterday.  I'm thinking, wow, maybe I have to pick up the Guinness Book of World Records book again.  Pennsylvania man holds record no one wants to break.  This guy, Matthew McKnight, hopes nobody manages to top his feet in the Guinness Book of World Records.  That's because McKnight holds the record for, are you ready for this? 
[00:26:30]  Greatest distance thrown in a car accident.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here it is now.  It's a bigger crash.  Look at him go, folks.  Look at him go.  And.  And there he is. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  I don't understand.  God bless him, though, man, for coming up with this record.  This McKnight, yeah, holds the record for greatest distance thrown in a car accident.  The 29-year-old record holder lived to tell about being thrown.  How many feet, Patrice?  What was the previous record holder?  Yeah.  Who held that?  I can guess.  Who's going like, damn, I got beat.  Do they even have the previous record holder?  That's why I don't understand.  I don't get it.  Like, how did they even.  I don't know.  I would say a mile. 
[00:27:30]  And they put in it.  A mile.  Wow.  Because for them to decide that this is a record, it had to be something ridiculous.  And they go, no one could have been thrown further than this.  I want to get in a car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway and be thrown off a cliff into  the water.  I would have the new record and then I would survive. 
[00:28:00]  I get it.  I get it.  It's far.  The guy was thrown 118 feet by a car that hit him while traveling about 70 miles an hour.  Oof.  Did his shoes come off?  They always come off.  Dude, he wasn't even in the car.  Car going 70 miles an hour.  This guy's on the side of the road helping another.  What was he helping?  Trying to help accident victims along Interstate 376. 
[00:28:30]  Kind of in the Pittsburgh area.  And then a car going 70 miles an hour hit him and he went flying 118 feet.  Now, do you have to live?  This record is a living.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure people.  This guy who died, he lost his head.  Yeah.  And he went 1,316 feet.  There's people in plane crashes and stuff that have flown miles.  Yeah.  You know, that record you've got to be alive for.  Yeah.  He suffered two dislocated shoulders and a broken shoulder, pelvis, leg, and tailbone. 
[00:29:00]  He spent two weeks in the hospital and 80 days in rehab before returning to work.  Evil Knievel.  There was a plane that broke in half over China.  And I think those people won the longest skydive without a parachute.  Parachute.  Longest free fall.  A lot of those records do hinge on the fact, are you alive or dead?  Because if you're dead, it ain't a record.  How about longest drowning?  Yeah.  Longest.  Because they have holding your breath the longest. 
[00:29:30]  They do have the person that can hold his breath the longest.  But if you're dead.  Longest fall into the Pacific.  And then slowly drowning and then drifting down into the murky darkness.  Yeah.  How about a record for how long you survived.  Wait.  How deep you were before you died?  In the water.  In the water.  There you go.  Right.  Exactly.  I was alive until my eardrum popped out.  That's a good one. 
[00:30:00]  You know, I'm sure the mafia would be involved with that record.  Cement shoes.  They drop you.  You know what I would think?  Officially, you're alive for a while.  There's somebody in the Mariana Trench right now.  You gotta be underwater with water on your body.  Or what if you're in one of those air pockets in the Titanic?  And the thing goes down and you're like, I sure hope we're still kind of on the surface.  Meanwhile, you got thousands of feet of water on your body.  There's some people that broke a record on the Titanic.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  They were in their room with the water just up to the ceiling. 
[00:30:30]  He's breathing going, maybe the rescues, maybe they'll rescue me soon.  And you're on the bottom.  Yeah.  Maybe they're.  No one's coming for 80 years.  Maybe they're circling this boat.  Yeah.  They can pull me out any second now.  80 years later, a robot camera's looking at your skeleton.  Oh, by the way, they don't do eating records.  Thanks to Pat from Menaki.  Ah, Pat knows that.  Because that wasn't safe, so they don't do the eating records anymore.  Oh, really?  So the hot dog, one of the hot dog eating contests can't get recognized. 
[00:31:00]  Mike in Jersey, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Yeah, I met a guy, his stage name was Henry Height.  You know, and back then, it was like 1968 or 1970, he was the world's tallest man in  a Guinness book.  He was listed at about 8 feet 2.  And back then, you know, I was a 10-year-old kid, I'm thinking, wow, that guy's name is  Henry Height.  You know, you're all impressionable at that age, you know.  Yeah.  And he was at a local supermarket, the Greens Supermarket in North Arlington. 
[00:31:30]  So a bunch of us went up to see the guy, and they brought him out of the freezer.  They kept him cold, they told us, in the freezer, because it was the summertime.  Yeah.  You know, so again, they're making all these impressions on us.  You know, you're little kids, and you see this guy, he weighed about 30 pounds, and  he was 8 feet tall, you know.  He was ugly looking.  That's it, boys.  Take it deep.  That's it, boys.  How about Paul Pituitary?  How about someone called the Gensburg World Records?  We got the world's most boring-est caller needs to be in the next edition of the book. 
[00:32:00]  That's the longest, the longest, you can be made sick by a story until you say shut  up.  The world's.  Three minutes, eight seconds.  The world's greatest who gives a crap phone call to a radio show goes to.  I love when, it makes me happy, you know, because, you know, you get on the radio, and  you just want to be funny, and then, you know, people go, ah, you suck.  Yeah.  And then it's just, do you realize, oh, it's five more hours of this, and all he needed 
[00:32:30]  was his two minutes to talk about Mr. Harry Height, and it just fizzled.  Harry Height.  It was, it fizzled into nothingness.  I guess his name was Henry Height.  He was 7'6".  He died in 1972.  Thank you, E-Rock.  I like the whole thing that goes before that, though, Patrice.  Like, he thought of it and went, this is a good idea.  Let me call up, and I'll get this on the air, and then you get on, and you're waiting, and  then you hear that, you're on the air, oh, here comes my story, and you tell it, and it 
[00:33:00]  just bombs, and then what do you do?  Anytime I get a heckler, and I go, and it's bad, I just go, do you see how hard it is?  I've been up here 36 minutes, and I said something bad once.  You just decided, oh, you fought it out.  You fought this story out.  He goes, this is going to be great, because it adds to, and he met Harry Height, but he  didn't go to think.  Harry Height.  Harry Height.  And usually men.  His name's Henry, but Harry Height sounds, Harry's funnier.  He's now Harry Height.  Harry Height sounds really funny, man. 
[00:33:30]  And he just was happy, because he thought he relived his, he got all nostalgic.  Yeah.  And it's weird to the man in here.  I'm just letting you know, sir, that you just, when you just called in.  To the man, everybody, no one wanted to say, you stunk.  And then, as we dissect it, he's getting more embarrassed.  He's almost got to turn the radio off until we're done talking about him.  Right about now, he's like, right about now, he's itching parts of his body, he didn't  even know it itched.  And O.B. called the elephant out in the room, he's like, look, dude, that was awful. 
[00:34:00]  I wanted to say it, I'm like, all right, I'm not going to say it.  And I'm like, that just stunk.  Is it just me?  Speaking of tall people and the Guinness Book of World Records, I blame the medical profession,  man.  They're curing these freaking...  The freaks.  What is it?  The pituitary gland keeps squeezing out juice in your brain, and that's why you become one  of these giants?  That's why you become one of those guys.  I'm like this.  I was 12 years old when I noticed I really started.  I was a lot bigger than the rest of my class. 
[00:34:30]  It was hard for me to even sit down and eat lunch with the rest of the class.  How tall were you when you were 12 years old, sir?  I was 7'1 at 12.  My pituitary gland just kept injecting, squeezing pituitary juice in.  And here's a picture of me on the basketball team.  I could only play for a week, and then my knees gave out.  Just because I'm tall doesn't mean I'm a healthy man.  My joints can't really take the height.  And then here's me in high school at 16 years old when I hit 8'4". 
[00:35:00]  Did you go to the prom or any of those?  Yes, I went to the prom.  Here's a picture of me with my date.  It was done in three separate photographs stitched together because she's up to my kneecap.  Because the gunpowder camera couldn't fit enough.  The old gunpowder camera couldn't fit all your body parts. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, I went to my prom.  We had a good time dancing.  Pinning the corsage on was hard.  If you look, that question mark is me pinning the corsage on her.  And that caused extreme lower back pain, huh?  Or back pain, which I had to go to the doctor for.  And they put me on a steroid, which actually increased my pituitary gland more. 
[00:36:00]  So here's a picture of me at 19 at 9'7".  But it seems like you lived a normal life.  Well, I tried living as normal a life as I could, but it was very difficult being as tall as I am.  My house, I was always bumping my head on the doorway and the lights.  And my mother and father were actually 5'4 each.  So it's strange that I came out to be so giant.  Now we're watching stock footage as you talk here.  And I see a little photo op where you're changing the light bulbs in the gym. 
[00:36:30]  It's kind of nice.  Yeah, I would do that.  So no ladder.  You could just see me smiling.  I'm always smiling in these pictures like I'm happy to be a freak.  How'd you make your money, man?  Usually with the circus.  The circus would come to town and I would just sit there in a chair and people would come by and point at me and take pictures with me.  And here I am.  This is me now at 22 years old. 
[00:37:00]  And I'm just short of 10 foot tall.  And still growing, I hear.  Still growing, but how much longer can I live?  I don't know, man.  You know, my heart just pumping blood to my brain.  It actually, it should have a pump like the Hoover Dam in it.  Yeah.  It's very difficult to pump blood up to my brain at this heart.  I hear your heart in between like pumping blood is huffing and puffing.  It huffs and puffs.  And then it pumps.  Hey, I see another photo of you as a Boy Scout in a Boy Scout uniform. 
[00:37:30]  Well, there it is.  It was custom made.  My mother had to sew it for me.  It's actually 18 different Boy Scout uniforms sewed together.  But I wanted to be a normal kid.  I just wanted to be like everybody else.  So I joined the Boy Scouts.  Yeah.  I see you stand in the back row when they take these group photos.  Here it is.  Yes.  Here's me getting my badge for catching an eagle.  And I just took him out of a tree.  He was in his nest and I just reached up and grabbed him. 
[00:38:00]  Everyone else had to make some kind of a trap.  Not me.  Not me.  Yeah.  They called me Old Basketball Heart.  It was the size of a basketball when I'd go to the doctor and they'd x-ray me.  Yeah.  Wonderful love being this tall.  And here is, wow, the love of my life.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  She's four foot two.  Eyes of blue.  Why didn't you at least try to get a woman that was six foot tall?  I don't know.  She's got to stand on a ladder for us to kiss. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  It's, and, and, and, uh, you know, making whoopee.  What are you packing for?  That's impossible.  You're a 10 foot man.  Uh, believe me, it's not proportioned.  You know, if, if it was proportioned, it would be as big as my, uh, my best gal.  Four foot two.  None of that pituitary guy down there?  No, no, no pituitary juice got to where it really matters.  No pituitary juice.  On me, I'd need an elephant trunk for it to even look right.  It's very embarrassing.  When I'd shower in the gym, actually I'd have to lay down and let four showers just hit me. 
[00:39:00]  But I tried to be as normal a kid as I could.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the case, all your special equipment you need, like your bed, your shoes?  Uh, mom and dad.  Mom and dad.  By the, I had to take three beds and put them together.  Uh, when I got a car, we had to take tin snips and cut the roof out and my head sticks out.  Looks like a cartoon.  And you also had to take the front seats out.  You're actually driving from the back seat. 
[00:39:30]  I'm driving from the back seat.  Actually, the trunk.  I drive from the trunk.  Right.  And, uh, it's very awkward because my knees are still in my face.  I hate when Paul parks it because he screws up all the settings on my seat.  Inside joke.  Linger longer.  Oos.  Very good.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Arizona.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I got a record that can, uh, beat the dude getting hit by 70.  I'll keep it short.  Okay.  A woman in, like, the 70s, uh, in the back of a plane that blew up, survived a 36,000 foot fall. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  I did hear about that.  She was strapped into that seat.  And what happened?  What happened?  The plane, like, broke up.  Okay.  And she was in the rear part of the fuselage by the tail.  And I guess somehow that kind of cushioned the fall.  Because you can't tell me you're going to fall from 35,000 feet.  But how does that cushion fall?  I know.  There must have been something where the tail caught the wind right or something.  Uh, because I... 
[00:40:30]  Was this plane transporting cotton balls?  What the hell?  How do you survive that?  She, uh...  But she...  Yeah, she lived through it.  Bubble wrap.  Well, that's all I got.  Thank you, sir.  Talk to you guys later.  Hey, speaking of, uh, that, something a little bit similar.  Here in New York, there's an amazing story.  There was, uh, two window washers, uh, brothers.  And, uh, I don't even know how these guys do this job.  But, uh, the scaffolding broke or whatever.  Yep.  And they plummet. 
[00:41:00]  47 stories.  Oh, my gosh.  The one guy...  The one brother hits a fence.  He's done.  Split in half.  Dead.  Eesh.  Immediately dead.  The other guy hits the ground.  He's still alive.  He fell 47 stories.  47 stories.  Didn't hit anything on the way down except for the sidewalk.  He's in a coma.  He's in really, really bad shape.  But, uh, this happened, I think, two or three days ago.  He's still alive.  How the hell do you live through that?  He's got extreme internal injuries, but he's still, uh...  No crap. 
[00:41:30]  Uh, he's in critical condition at the hospital.  Doctors say it's amazing he survived it all.  Now his wife is praying he'll make it home one day.  Uh...  I think that's about it.  I'm horrified.  But it's true.  Oh, okay.  Those stories make me cringe.  Uh, critical condition with grave injuries to his internal organs and his being kept heavily  sedated.  And listen to this.  Because his, um, his organs...  Oh, there it is, right?  Uh, okay.  She said doctors saved her husband's legs, this is the wife talking, obviously, with an operation,  but that his internal organs were so swollen, physicians had to cut them open to allow 
[00:42:00]  them to expand.  Whoa.  So they, they cut him open and let his organs just swell up.  They must have cracked his ribs or whatever and opened them up to make more room.  And opened his abdomen for his liver and everything else.  Yeah, make more room in his cavity so these organs could swell, so maybe they, uh, you know,  will, will survive.  He's just tenderized.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just a tenderized guy. 
[00:42:30]  Dude, the guy's still alive, though.  That's insane.  Yeah, but...  There's nothing soft on the way down here in Manhattan, man.  Oh, my gosh.  Uh, you think that when you're falling like that?  You go, hey, you think I'll make this?  I can make this.  Oh, that ah factor.  That ah, that, that thinking factor just makes me sick.  That's why car crashes don't bother me.  It's just because you're driving and then you aren't driving.  You know, the car accident is so arbitrary. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Like, a plane crash is so forever.  Like, it's just...  Yeah, you got a long way to go sometimes.  Like, like, you have somebody say to you, hey, man, you know, you're more likely to die  in a car crash.  And you go, I don't give a...  Like, I've, I've been in five car accidents, really.  Like, I used to pick glass out of my head for years.  And it just didn't matter.  And I always thought, if you compare a car crash, the only way you can compare the two  is if, if you're driving up the street and you see the truck that's going to hit you  like 30,000 feet away. 
[00:43:30]  And you have to keep driving into the truck.  Like, you know you're going to die for 15 minutes.  I've never seen it that way before, but you're onto something.  When people have time to write notes and stuff to loved ones, because they, they do that  sometimes, oh, we're crashing.  This really sucks.  I love you.  Hope everything's fine.  I'm going to pin this to my jacket.  Let me see.  Yeah.  All right.  We're at 28,000 feet now.  We're going to crash.  But, you know, they, they started the movie, so, ah, might as well watch the movie. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, we're starting to roll now.  We're spinning over and over.  Ah, you got to hold somebody's hand.  You don't know how some weird deal with God.  Like, I wish clouds were hard.  But you could just crash into that.  If you crash into a cloud, that'd be different.  How about you're holding someone's hand you don't know, and then that one person for eternity  will know that you really, truly are a wussy.  Oh, man.  Grab my hand, dude.  You're this tough rap dude. 
[00:44:30]  And that one person will know for eternity that, no, you're a wuss.  You cried your eyes out all the way down.  And you cannot live.  I don't know if I ever said this before, but Gavin used to be in these, he's one of these  SAS from England or whatever.  Yeah, sure.  And he said, you know why you can't live in a plane crash.  You know why they have you tuck your head in between your legs when you crash?  You know that whole thing?  Yeah, yeah.  It's so that you break your neck. 
[00:45:00]  And you're not suffering like this guy with his swollen insides.  It's so that you die quickly when the plane hits.  Nice.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, I totally believe that.  It's right.  Yeah, I completely believe that one.  Hey, listen, we got to take a quick break.  We can continue with that.  We got to talk about Obama.  We got to talk about the dude selling their kidneys for not much money, man.  I know it goes a long way in the Philippines, but we'll get into this whole story after  the break as well.  All right.  Just a going rate of pancreas. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Rolling right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm going to blow out my nose.  What?  I'm going to blow out my nose.  Got to do that in front of a mirror.  Why?  Because you never know what kind of collateral damage you're going to leave.  I want to sell it as art.  Pablo Picasso has nothing on me.  Watch.  There is nothing good that comes out of your nose, and I never, ever want to see it. 
[00:46:00]  Not even after I do it.  Oh, that's beautiful.  I got to go to Soho like this.  All I have to do is sign it, frame it, and I'm good to go.  Why hasn't anyone made that into art?  Maybe I'll be that.  Probably have.  Maybe I'll be that guy.  Snot.  Snot art.  Snot art.  Snot art.  Yeah, I call it snart.  Snart.  Why not, man?  Why not?  Hey, we were going to get into some heavy lifting here, but we got some brand new remixes, and 
[00:46:30]  the bit is alive and well.  We want to bury this bit.  No joke.  I don't even know if Patrice knows about the bit.  Were you here when we played The Sounds of Steve?  The Sounds of Steve.  Our own Steve, before he does some production for the show.  He says this is warming up his voice, but it's so ridiculous that I don't know why he  does it.  Right.  It doesn't sound like a me, me, me, me, or a, you know, la, la, la, the way people warm 
[00:47:00]  their voice up.  This sounds like it would hurt your voice.  This is what he does.  What?  That's Steve.  He's just a weirdo, and he's trying to say that this is how he warms up his voice.  So then, I believe, was it Coke Logic that started this?  So Coke Logic, I believe, took those sounds, and he put it to a song we all know from the 
[00:47:30]  old days.  It's quick.  This.  This.  Ow, she's a, ah.  Ow.  She's my tonight cat.  Just letting it all hang out.  Ow, she's a, ah.  Ow.  I like Lady Stack.  That's a fact.  Ain't holding nothing back.  Ow, she's a, ah.  Ow.  Ow.  Well, put together, everybody knows. 
[00:48:00]  This is how the story goes.  Ah.  Hey, really fast.  I gotta give major props to Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Yes.  Yes, I'm with you, Fast Freddy.  What was he saying?  Picasso would never call opium, mm-mm.  Repo Man.  Repo Man line.  Oh, okay.  Love that movie.  I'm with you today, Fast Freddy.  So anyway, there's Coke Logic.  He took that annoying noise from Steve and threw it into a song, okay?  Here's another example of one we played. 
[00:48:30]  This is leading to brand new ones, obviously.  This is Cody in Indiana.  He took Steve's wacky noises and put it to this classic, classic song.  Some people call me the space cowboy.  Yeah.  Some call me the gangster of love.  Some people call me Maureen.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:49:00]  Even when you know it's coming.  Patrice, we know this is stupid, but it's taken on a life of its own.  We've gotten dozens of these in.  We've played probably 10 or 12 of them.  And we got new ones today.  That one's pretty good, though.  All right, well.  And he waited, too.  He waited until he needed it.  And we know when a bit's over, and we really thought, like, last week we were going to  bury this Steve C. remixes.  But then a whole bunch came in over the weekend, and Drew Boogie has one that we're leading 
[00:49:30]  to here that made us laugh so effing hard.  But first, we go to this one sent in from Georgia.  It's Ricky and Georgia taking Steve's sounds.  What?  What?  What?  What?  That was pretty good. 
[00:50:00]  It's just the stupidest, dumbest thing.  And then Sean in Jersey sent this one in.  How'd your parents die? 
[00:50:30]  How'd your parents die?  Shut up.  New kids. 
[00:51:00]  That's a good one.  Yeah, he went old school now, right?  And then we move on with Matt.  Oh, Matt the intern came up with one?  Let's see what Matt came up with.  Taking Steve's sounds, of course, and throwing it to a tune.  This is a song we were talking about on Friday, I believe.  Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance.  I'm right there if you get lonely.  Give this song another listen.  Close your eyes. 
[00:51:30]  Listen to my voice.  It's my disguise.  I'm by your side.  It's what you do to me.  It's what you do to me.  It's what you do to me.  It's what you do to me.  It's what you do to me.  Hey, right on.  Matt gets a passing grade for that.  Very good. 
[00:52:00]  And then we finally get to Drew Boogie.  And I think it's over.  I think Drew Boogie hit it out of the park.  Drew always does a bang-up job.  Drew's one of our boys, and he took the Steve sounds and just came up with another masterpiece.  Yeah.  Here's Drew Boogie.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, I didn't realize 
[00:53:00]  There you go  Drew's amazing  Yeah  Not bad, right?  Drew is like  Just some of the remixes that came in over the weekend right there  Drew's Martini Steve thing is like one of my favorite things I ever heard 
[00:53:30]  Oh, yeah  Which one?  It's Martini Steve  Like, I don't even  I don't even know, like, what it does  But when I heard it, I was like, wow  Well, it's not Martini Steve anymore  He's a good boy these days  Uh, this?  It's Martini Steve  I just love that, man  I love that  It's Martini Steve  It's just like  I think Steve did that  It seems  I think it's true, isn't it?  Even though it's something you could  I just wouldn't do it  Yeah  I wouldn't do it 
[00:54:00]  Well, I mean  If you want  I mean, we haven't played in a while  The Don't Worry Be Happy thing is my favorite, actually  Hold on  It gets everyone happy  I think this is perfect for Monday  Uh, this thing  This is Drew Boogie as well  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Bye-bye. 
[00:54:30]  Bye-bye. 
[00:55:00]  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  That's great, right?  It's terrible. I'm sorry.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Okay, the big story today is on our front page.  Oh, everybody's talking about it across the nation because it's such important news.  Omentum!  Omentum.  Omentum.  I'm starting to feel this Obama again. 
[00:55:30]  No, you're not.  Absolutely.  Stop it.  Does that make you sad?  No, it's just I know it's not true.  I'm a dreamer.  A dreamer?  I'm a dreamer.  What kind of dream is that?  I just want something different.  What do you mean by that?  Something different for this country.  What kind of dream?  This is just a...  What kind of dream?  What?  To have a black president?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  As a white guy.  What kind of dream is it to have a black president?  Really?  That's crazy.  So forget black people's dreams.  So you're just saying we just had no dreams in our entire existence here. 
[00:56:00]  It's not a dream for Anthony.  It's a nightmare.  No, it's just...  White, White, what do you think he's going to do, Anthony?  He's going to make having guns in your home illegal.  What is he going to do?  Get revenge for slavery is your ultimate fear?  No, I just think my already ridiculously high taxes will be even higher and will go  to various programs that I...  It has nothing to do with blackness.  What?  It does have something to do with black.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, he's going to give all the money to Negroes.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  No, it's this...  You know what it is?  How do you think that's what he's going to do?  It's his phoniness I don't like. 
[00:56:30]  I don't like this whole phoniness.  As opposed to what?  George Bush's honesty?  No, that's phony, too.  So you...  I don't like that either.  So you just want any white...  You don't care if it's a white guy's phoniness.  Is there a genuine white guy out there?  I think like Bill Clinton, there were genuine white guys out there that were actually trying  to do what he felt was best for everybody, black, white, whatever.  Like Bill Clinton, he was a jackass. 
[00:57:00]  You know, he liked getting a little more than he should have, I think, while you're in the  office.  But I seriously think the guy had good intentions.  And one of those good intentions that he had, did any come to fruition?  Yeah.  Any?  No.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Give a black president...  It'll only be four years.  Give him a chance.  I just see that as being the beginning of the race war.  And he's a light-skinned black. 
[00:57:30]  It's not like they're giving us...  Dude, are you listening to...  Is anyone...  Is any white people listening to what he's saying?  It's not like they're giving us...  Or do you just look at him and go, wow, he speaks so well.  Kill whitey?  Well, not kill whitey, but here's what black candidates, black entertainers, black politicians  that are already in, here's what they do that they don't think white people are listening.  When they get in front of a large group of only black people, they say crap that they 
[00:58:00]  think the white people aren't going to hear.  We hear it.  Well, here's my big problem, and I have said this, that if you're a black president, presidential  candidate, you cannot look for the support of black people, and I'll tell you why.  Oh, okay.  I'll tell you why.  Because of what you just said.  Yeah.  White people...  See, black leaders in this country are always picked by who white people hate.  Black people don't vote for our leaders.  No.  And our leaders are always, if you notice, people that white people hate. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Al Sharpton, they hate them.  Farrakhan.  They hate Jesse Jackson, they hate them.  Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell aren't our leaders.  Uncle Toms, they call.  They're not our leaders.  Right.  But they should be, because they're black.  So if I was a black candidate, I would make sure that I didn't distance myself, but I  would make sure that people didn't feel that white people who have to vote for me, for  me to be president, didn't feel like I was going to only support black folks. 
[00:59:00]  As soon as white people see that black people love you and you love them back, they're not  going to vote for you.  So whether you do or not, and the thing is, if you don't, if you don't support, if you  don't support, they're still going to vote for you if you're a black president.  So even if you don't support black people as a black candidate, when you get up to that point where you might be the president, we're going to vote for you anyway, because you're the black president. 
[00:59:30]  But just because he's black.  Yes.  Yeah.  I just like to.  That doesn't that that to me reeks of phoniness, just like to what just like white people have, just like dopey, uh, you're not  religious black.  Huh?  You're not voting for him because he's black.  No, I've heard what he says.  Really?  Colin Powell is black.  And before he made that ridiculous faux pas at the UN, uh, by, by kissing George Bush's ass and going in there and coming up with all kinds of cockamamie, uh, chemical warfare vans driving around Iraq. 
[01:00:00]  He was definitely a viable candidate that white people would have voted for.  Absolutely.  You?  Yeah.  Given the right circumstances.  Running against retards.  Not black.  It's the right circumstances.  I'm kidding.  Look, Barack Obama.  Why don't you just say it?  What?  You're not going to vote for him because he's black.  No, it's because I don't like.  See?  No, that isn't true. 
[01:00:30]  I want.  Other people are going to vote for him because he's black.  But I know what the hell he's he stands for.  What does he stand for?  What does Obama stand for?  Obama stands for, uh, helping, um, let's see, uh, the impoverished.  And by that, I mean, um, poor black people.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  But if you say that it means just black people, then people go, oh, you're saying everybody  that's impoverished is black?  And then it starts that whole thing.  There's just more, there's more poor white people than poor black people. 
[01:01:00]  There are because of population.  Yeah.  But it just doesn't seem to, like, work that way with black politicians.  They will usually.  Does it work that way with white politicians?  Do they, do they?  Yes.  We're guilty as hell, these stupid politicians.  Then why do you think they're always reading in front of a school full of black kids?  Give me one goddamn politician during an election year that sits in front of white pink kids  and read to them.  Why aren't they allowed?  Constantly reading to little black kids. 
[01:01:30]  To read in front of little black kids.  But it's all they do.  And I reject what you're saying.  What?  Just like you're saying it with passion doesn't mean it's true.  I've seen them read in front of little white kids.  They, they, no.  And little quarter white kids.  Never.  Ever.  Really?  It's always, there's 20 little black kids around and the book's open and they're all  reading to the black kids.  Matter of fact, I think it was a school full of white kids that the president was reading.  And that reeks of phoniness.  During the, uh, during 9-11.  It was just a sub.  Oh, really?  A class full of white kids?  I believe so.  That one?  Yeah, show me a picture. 
[01:02:00]  There you go.  You just reject.  I'm reject what you're saying until you prove it.  I want to see.  I want to see your goofy.  Ma, you always see it.  You always see it.  All right, then I can say the same thing.  I always see what you're saying.  I see, you see it.  You see the white kids they read in front of.  Punch up politicians reading kids and then pop every goddamn picture up.  Punch up Negro children reading too.  No, you don't even have to put Negro in.  You don't have to put Negro children, white politicians reading.  Like, stop it, Anthony.  Just say, just say you're not voting for him because he's black and let's move on. 
[01:02:30]  No, you're trying to oversimplify this for me.  It's more complicated than that.  And then I'll say that you would just vote for him because he's black.  Of course.  Okay, then I'll vote for him because he's black.  I won't vote for him because he's black.  I don't care what his politics are.  It doesn't make a difference.  Don't you see black people don't make a difference?  That's what Oprah's doing then.  Then that's exactly what Oprah's doing.  So?  Momentum.  Okay.  But why can't you support each other because you're white all day? 
[01:03:00]  All right, I'll fess up.  Yes.  I'm not voting for him because he's black.  Yeah.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Let's get to omensum, racist.  I'm a racist.  If his name was Cliff Barnstall, you might vote for him.  Colin Powell has no white person going to vote for somebody named Barack Obama.  But he's light-skinned black, too, there.  It's not like they're giving us a Forrest Whitaker black guy. 
[01:03:30]  If it was Fox.  It's Jesse Jackson on TV.  Yeah.  He's our leader.  But we didn't vote for him.  But he's our leader because y'all don't like him.  You saw what Andrew Young said, right?  No.  He says that Bill Clinton is more black than Obama and has probably been with more black women.  Who cares?  Well, because there's a lot of people nervous now with Oprah and Obama that Clinton's campaign is slowing down a bit. 
[01:04:00]  Thank God.  And Andrew Young came out and said, look, the Clintons are into the black people, too.  Who wants a woman president?  They're all going for the black vote right now.  No one can have a woman president.  It's not acceptable.  Well, Oprah doesn't even want a woman president.  She went for black over woman.  Because she has a monthly.  She knows that, you know, what her decisions are every month is against.  Like, I see what happens to my girl every month.  And if she had to make a logical decision during that time, the world would be over.  If she if during her month, you know what she said today? 
[01:04:30]  She said her hair hurts.  Like, she feels like cutting off all her hair because it hurts right now.  And if you had a button that control rockets in front of her when her hair hurts.  Yeah.  Instead of hair, it would be the Koreans hurt.  Yeah.  Are you out of your way?  Why don't you shut up, Africans, and then launch a missile?  Yeah.  The Koreans hurt right now.  I need to get rid of the Koreans.  They hurt me.  You can't have an emotional creature like that running the world.  They're in menopause stage. 
[01:05:00]  I'm sure it gets a little better.  Oh, that's right.  A little hot flashes, maybe.  Hillary's winding down.  Yeah, she's winding down a little bit.  She's winding down.  And how much of a woman was she, really?  She's at the hot flashes.  She's having a hot flashes.  Hot flashes.  That womb is drying up like a prune.  And she got to drink soy milk every morning to get that estrogen count back up.  She drinks insure.  You don't want your president drinking insure this morning.  Insure.  Man, that's some old lady milk. 
[01:05:30]  Keep her beard from growing.  Old lady milk.  Keep her beard from getting lupus.  I'm more in the camp of I don't give a crap, by the way.  I just like the excitement that Oprah's bringing to this whole race right now.  Excitement.  It's fun to see 30,000 people showing up for an Obama rally because Oprah's there.  She's like doing book of the month and she's like candidate of the month.  It's all coming together.  Let me tell you what I didn't like about the Oprah thing.  When Oprah went to Iowa stumping for Obama, she gets up there and sounds like Oprah Winfrey 
[01:06:00]  from the TV show because there were predominantly white people in the audience.  She goes down to South Carolina.  It's 30,000 black people.  She gets up there and this is a quote from her.  She goes, I ain't here to talk about no books.  I ain't here to talk about no books.  That's friggin' Oprah.  It's phony.  It's a put on. 
[01:06:30]  It is phony.  Oh, stop it, Patrice.  Let me explain to you.  It's phony.  I'm going to explain to you real quick.  All right.  Okay.  White people only have one.  Ant's getting nervous that we might have a black president.  You can hear in his voice.  I'm not nervous.  White people only have one cultural thing to answer to.  If you have to answer to two, relate to two different things.  If you fish, you have to use bait to catch different fish.  You understand what I'm saying? 
[01:07:00]  Some fish you need a worm.  Some fish you need another small fish.  You don't relate to people the same way.  Black people like to hear somebody go, y'all, sometimes.  I ain't here to talk about no books.  And they go, you know what?  I like that.  White people like to hear you go.  I talked to a friend of mine.  I will not say his name.  He can say his name if he wants to.  I was talking about that dumb Ricky Hatton and how I was having trouble.  The Ricky Hatton Mayweather fight and how I was having trouble making a decision.  Because Mayweather annoys me a little bit just with what he does. 
[01:07:30]  But I had to choose over him or this white boy from England.  I chose Mayweather.  Okay.  And I said, why is it that white people can't let black people have nothing?  What?  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  What?  Listen to me.  Why is it that you just, it's like your fury towards us won't stop?  Are you kidding me?  Wait a minute.  Let me, I'll say this last thing.  He goes, he goes, if you, he had to run down to me why I'm not famous. 
[01:08:00]  Like he goes, a guy like you should be a millionaire.  That's what I agree with that wholeheartedly.  He said, all we want you to do, and this is for white people, white friend of mine.  All we want you to do is just be polite.  Black, white people want black people to go, yes, sir.  Polite.  Yeah.  Just to be a guy who makes you feel comfortable.  No.  That's why you're nervous about Barack.  He does make white people feel comfortable. 
[01:08:30]  But when you get into that, that's why white people will hate, they don't hate the color.  It's the, it's the confidence or the arrogance.  That ain't right.  It has nothing to do with that.  It's not so much.  I want you to make me feel comfortable.  You do.  I don't want you to make me feel uncomfortable.  There's a difference.  Don't try to work.  There's a big difference.  I don't need anyone coming up to me going, yes, sir.  Anthony just tried to pet me just now with words.  I don't need anyone, black or white, to come up to me and go, yes, sir, yes, sir, no, sir. 
[01:09:00]  I don't need that.  I don't care.  But don't come up to me with an effing attitude for no reason.  You don't understand.  It's not an attitude.  What is it?  It's flair.  Flair.  And then, wait, wait.  And don't run away from what I was saying about Oprah before.  You say with the different types of bait for different types of fish.  Okay.  So she feels the need to go up in front of a crowd full of black people and say, I have  to relate to these people, so let me sound completely uneducated. 
[01:09:30]  Uneducated.  Yes, it is.  It's where she might have been.  Now, if she's in front of the NAACP, she's going to go, ladies and gentlemen, we're here  to say to you this evening.  Now, Oprah is super famous.  Of course.  Okay?  Today, we have to say this.  And in front of those black people, it'll be like that.  In front of people in South Carolina at certain places, it's just like R. Kelly.  White people know R. Kelly from, I believe I can fly. 
[01:10:00]  I believe I can fly.  Black people know him from, in that.  But black people know him from Booty.  Booty.  He sings a song where he just goes, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-T.  And it's a different, relatable thing.  Like, Martha Stewart doesn't have to relate to a hip-hop kind of world.  And she doesn't have to relate to all white people.  She just has to relate to whoever gravitates towards her.  Let me tell you something.  Then how come, oh, you take a white politician. 
[01:10:30]  Let's take Rudy Giuliani.  Okay.  If he goes down South, he's not going y'all.  He's still a guy from New York.  And then when he goes to the Pacific Northwest, he doesn't have to drink Starbucks in a rain  slicker doing heroin.  Exactly.  And then when he does, why then this phony put-on, let me try to relate to the different  types of black people.  Well, maybe it's a freedom that she, she is that, though.  She's not.  Listen, Oprah has to be a certain way on her billion-dollar show that mostly all white women 
[01:11:00]  support.  So that's phony.  It might be.  It might be.  Okay.  When she goes someplace, when you get, when you're free to be, like, you just, it's a  loop.  You ever go to a black party and a white party, I know this is black, but we are different.  Black parties, people dance.  Thank God you said it.  White parties, people drink.  Yeah.  It's just, we're different.  And when you go up and go, I ain't here to support no, because she knows black people, 
[01:11:30]  what they feel about her, like old funky Oprah with old book club, right?  And she has to go up there and go, man, I'm, man, I'm as down as anybody.  Like Brian Gumbel.  I saw Brian, where I turned with Brian Gumbel, he was talking about when Muhammad Ali lost  the, um, uh, Joe Frazier.  Yeah.  He cried like a baby, but he's not a gangster, but there's a blackness, there's a pride there,  but still you have to go out.  So you guys got to lose that crap.  I, I, you gotta lose it.  Or, or, or we'll never, ever be a, a, a, a single nation of white and black people living 
[01:12:00]  together.  That'll be it.  That'll be the final thing.  Is that, is that the racial deal we're making?  If we, if Oprah can go and speak the same way to everybody, the same way she speaks to  white people or black people.  It's part of it.  It's part of it.  Why don't you speak black?  I'm not, well, let's look at me.  I'm not sitting there talking about spaghetti and meatballs 24 hours a day because I'm Italian,  and I'm not sitting there with my Italian-ness dripping and my Italian pride and wearing 
[01:12:30]  a little fedora and looking like I just got off at Ellis Island every, that's the wonderful  thing about white people.  Yes.  That's what holds us back as black people.  It does.  What holds us back is that we have to support blackness sometimes.  Sometimes we shouldn't.  So like Michael Vick, we shouldn't be galvanizing because white people are not supporting, but  anytime white people, and this is the thing we, and this thing about how we feel about  y'all, anytime you're talking, it seems to be a condescending you people, but white people 
[01:13:00]  don't have you people.  You don't have, you have, you have individuality.  You can hate another white guy.  You don't have to, your millions has nothing to do with his millions.  Because if Fan does something, if Fan goes out and kills somebody, white people will  not go, you know, you have to, you have to stop that.  They'll just go, that boy was bad.  All right.  But we do talk about the white, white shooters that do those, do those school shootings. 
[01:13:30]  They're always white kids.  You dismiss them.  That's what I'm saying.  You do have that in your blood where you can dismiss your criminals.  We just don't have that.  Well, that's your problem.  You got to figure that out.  I don't know how to figure that out.  I don't know either.  But hey, it should be pointed out that, yeah, Hillary Clinton did the fake Southern accent.  Oh yeah, she did.  Well, she's the phoniest, she's the phoniest bitch ever.  Ever.  So white guys aren't doing anything phony?  All right, listen.  No, they are.  Absolutely.  Hold on.  I just rang the bell. 
[01:14:00]  Eat my watermelon here.  I'm upset.  Bell.  I know.  I know.  That's why I was laughing hysterically.  That was really funny.  Our fruit came and Patrice has a, man, I've never seen more watermelon in front of a person  in my life.  That looks really juicy and good though.  I got some dumb pink grapefruit and you got watermelon.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm going to have to, just because white people might see me.  When we come back, I want to talk about.  Uh oh, sit down.  What happened?  He's getting a.  This is what I'm saying.  The magic that white people have over our brain.  Sit down.  It's not though.  You guys have won for years now. 
[01:14:30]  You just can't face the fact that you're winning and you're still like acting like it's 1969.  You're winning.  Enjoy your victories.  You just.  You're just going around still like, oh my God, we're still the most persecuted thing  on the face of the earth.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's true.  You're winning.  We're not winning.  Yes, you are.  Round two after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh my God.  It continued during the break.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal in studio. 
[01:15:00]  Oh my God.  Now we're talking about black quarterbacks versus white quarterbacks.  Real fast.  Throw a blanket statement like that.  I know.  Hold on.  Real fast.  Patrice is going to be at Comics here in New York City.  C-O-M-I-X.  If you're trying to find it on the old internet.  It's going to be there the 28th and 29th of this month on Friday and Saturday night.  A couple shows each night.  Give them a call.  212-524-2500.  Here to book your seats for Patrice O'Neal at Comics.  Thank you, sir.  His comedy is amazing, man. 
[01:15:30]  It almost looks like you're just riffing every time I see you.  Why, thank you, sir.  I don't know if you are, but you get...  Sometimes.  Sometimes you're just going with it.  That's kind of brief, right?  Yes.  But we're talking about white quarterbacks and black quarterbacks.  Tim Tebow.  Yeah, he won the Heisman.  Won the Heisman for the Gators.  If you're in the college football, Tim Tebow.  He's an animal.  He's a great quarterback.  But this is what I was saying about, like, we left with the watermelon, right?  Hold on, hold on.  Let me explain, though, for the people that don't know.  Tebow, he plays for the Gators. 
[01:16:00]  My nephew is a massive Gators fan.  He went out to Vegas last year for the big game and blah, blah, blah.  But anyway, this guy is 6'4", 230 pounds, something like that.  White boy, don't forget.  White boy.  Gotta say he's a white boy.  I think he threw for 29 touchdowns and ran for 22, something like that.  Right, those numbers are around there.  Around there.  Either he ran for 29 and threw for 22, but...  And I was reading about him over the weekend.  They're saying that most likely the NFL doesn't want a quarterback like him. 
[01:16:30]  It's too risky to pay a guy, you know, so much money that's going to get hit like this  guy gets hit in college football.  This guy takes some ridiculous hits.  But he's a physical specimen.  He'll go just because of his physicality.  Oh, they'll give it a shot, obviously.  But, you know, like Tom Brady, you don't want him taking those type of hits.  You don't want Peyton Manning taking those type of hits.  But if Peyton Manning...  That this kid takes...  If Tom Brady or Peyton Manning could run, like Michael Vick...  This is the black quarterback versus the white quarterback thing.  And actually did run. 
[01:17:00]  Do you think people would...  This is what bugs me, the magic that white people have over our minds.  If I can run, why not run?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's like every time a black quarterback...  It's almost like Donovan McNabb.  He got his...  For the Philadelphia Eagles.  Yeah.  He got his leg hurt, right?  It's almost like he's happy he got hurt.  So he can now not run.  So that he can throw.  So white people can go...  Now he can be the white...  Hold on.  I'm a quarterback.  Like you like white people.  Instead of being the physical talent you are. 
[01:17:30]  So he can be the white quarterback in the pocket just to...  Yeah, to make white people feel better.  But Tim Tebow, who's a runner...  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  No one says, oh, he needs to learn the game.  He's a little bit dumb.  He's not smart enough for the game.  It's like, why do we let white people just have power over what we do?  It makes me sick how much credit we give you for our life.  No.  Why do you people buy so much?  Here's what kills me. 
[01:18:00]  I had to argue with this white boy about what we buy.  Black people buy rims and chains.  You know what white people buy?  Life-size statues of Superman.  For $5,000.  That's what you buy.  What are you talking about?  Shelby's for $10 million.  Like people that are doing very well.  Well-off people.  People with money.  Of color will buy watches and chains and stuff.  Diamonds.  And then white people will buy other things like giant statues of Batman for their lobby. 
[01:18:30]  Gold toasters.  Like that's what white people...  Gold toasters.  We're just different and we're going to always be different.  Who gives a crap?  Why can't we just say that instead of always trying to act like an angel?  Patrice is different and we're always going to be different.  Patrice, you always try to make it like, all right, here's the situation.  Now just say you're racist and everything will be fine.  Like it's not...  You can discuss the point.  There could be something in there without the white guy having to be racist. 
[01:19:00]  I wish it was.  I pray that it is.  I pray you stop.  Oh, stop.  Just stop being racist or just be racist.  Hold on.  Let's...  Oh, man.  We had someone that was at the Oprah...  I'm calling it the Oprah rally yesterday, but...  Oh, Mentum.  I guess they had to go to work.  Let's go to Mark in Atlanta.  Mark, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  I've got to call you out on the way you're ranking on Oprah.  I mean, I don't watch her.  I've never watched her.  But I know that when you get a guest in the studio, say, that is a foreign-bred Brooklynite, 
[01:19:30]  you drop right into the New York, heavy New York accent.  Like who?  Really?  Say the guys from The Sopranos or Goodfellas.  Hey, what are you doing?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah.  Hey, got my goal.  Why do you do that, sir?  Hey, maybe it's different, you know, people, different bait for different fish. 
[01:20:00]  You know what I mean?  If you want to sleep with the fish, you get...  Is that true?  I don't know if that's true.  No, it's...  I've been with Anthony a long time.  I've never noticed that.  If it is true, it's not...  I've never noticed that.  If it is true, let me tell you something.  If it is true, it's not calculated, first of all.  And I'm discussing something with somebody.  But Oprah is calculated.  So maybe I will.  It's absolutely calculated.  Maybe she just...  Why would Oprah...  She's just feeling like, what's up, y'all?  Why would she want to go up there? 
[01:20:30]  And she's a very educated woman.  Why would she want to go up there and sound completely uneducated?  I ain't here to talk about no books.  Well, why is that sounding...  Why is that not colloquialism?  Why...  You were relating...  He's saying you were trying to relate to Mr. Zubaduba from whatever, and you just  was just...  It just comes out.  Patrice, as the referee, I've been with him for a long time.  I've never seen him do that.  I probably...  You know something?  I'll even give the guy the benefit of the doubt. 
[01:21:00]  I probably do...  I would love to get some examples of that.  Get a little more guinea when we have an Italian guy in here.  Frank Vincent comes in, starts talking about things.  It's like, yeah, you want to kind of...  Ah, you want to kind of goodfellas it up a little bit.  And I don't really carry the wave, but I did notice the Oprah thing sounded a little weird.  I'm with you on that.  I was like, why would she talk like that?  Why wouldn't she just use her just regular delivery like she has every day on her show?  No one would think any different of her if she spoke like she does on her show, and  like I know she speaks in business meetings or whatever. 
[01:21:30]  She's got to say, I ain't here to talk about no books.  I thought it was...  That, first of all...  I thought it was strange.  I'm like, wow, that just sounds out of place.  As far as grammar goes, it's awful.  It was an impassioned kind of relatable thing to do.  Yeah, like black people don't like no books.  Nah.  Why talks about the books?  Maybe she's secretly working for the white man.  And this would turn a lot of people off.  But it's because black people might see her as this black woman who just buys schools 
[01:22:00]  in Africa and relates to all white women in that way where it's like, hey, read this  book this week.  And it's never read like the black novel that has a pimp on the front and a hooker on the  back cover.  It's kind of...  It's like she's saying, look, I'm not here to be the Oprah that we all know.  She's not a fan of that culture.  She said it.  She's not a fan of the hip-hop culture and having those people on to talk about hip-hop.  What do you mean by those people?  I mean those people. 
[01:22:30]  What do you mean?  People that are hip-hop culture.  Those people.  You know what I mean?  I love when people do that.  What do you mean by those people?  Hey, hold on.  We got Richie.  No, she has Negroes on.  I've seen it.  Hold on.  We're going all the way to Putnam Valley for Rich's phone call here.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to start by agreeing with Anthony because it absolutely aggravates me when I hear somebody  speak that way.  But Patrice hits the nail on the head and it's a culture thing. 
[01:23:00]  I just understood it on the way to work today.  I'm going to a corporate job.  It's corporate culture.  I will speak differently all day today than I will when I go out to the bar tonight with  my buddies and I speak different to my children.  And Anthony, from 9 o'clock, before 9 o'clock on, one way you speak, after 9 o'clock, you  speak another.  Wow.  All right.  Dude, you don't understand.  I'm not going up to give a speech to people. 
[01:23:30]  I'm not changing the way I talk giving a speech like Oprah did.  Wait a minute.  If this guy, who sounds like he probably is on a softball team, one of those dudes.  What's wrong with being on a softball team?  No, no, no, no.  Listen, you're racist.  Hey, what's wrong with softball?  I'm saying that if he gave a pep rally for a softball team for Saturday, he's going to  go, we're going to give it, blah, blah, blah.  But at work, if he gives some type of pep thing at his work, he's going to go, we had 
[01:24:00]  a wonderful, you know, this month was a wonderful time.  We made a lot of money.  That's what I'm saying.  She's in front of who she thinks.  She goes, I ain't here to do no books, y'all.  Right?  Right?  And they're like, we don't read.  We don't read.  It's like, I'm not here to be white Oprah.  I'm here to be black Oprah.  And she did.  That's what she was doing.  What is wrong with that?  She has a lot of influence when it comes to books and stuff.  And then she talks like she doesn't read one. 
[01:24:30]  She should just be the educated, successful black woman that she is.  She's not here to talk no books.  And not.  Why?  Why is it?  The woman is probably the most successful woman in the history of this country.  She's a black woman.  And instead of just being a woman that is successful, she's got to have the blackness that comes out so everyone else can go, good, we can still like her because she's black. 
[01:25:00]  Why can't she just be a successful woman?  If Martha Stewart, say Martha Stewart, had dual loyalties.  You know, she's loyal to something.  And then she's cooking a pie.  And that's what she's known for.  Try this pie.  This pie is delicious.  And she goes out somewhere and then goes, I ain't here to cook no pies.  That's not saying don't eat pies.  And she's saying, look, I'm not here to do what y'all see.  This is.  Listen, forget those books.  Not like don't read, dumb Negroes. 
[01:25:30]  I understand.  I understand.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm effing with you as far as that's concerned.  All right.  But she shouldn't have to put this dual personality on because who she is, an educated woman that came from crap, built herself up to be one of the richest, most successful women in history.  She doesn't have to do that.  She shouldn't have to.  Exactly.  Why, when she gets in front of 30,000 black people, does she feel compelled that she's got to fit in? 
[01:26:00]  And why can't the people respect her for where she came from and where she is without her having to jive it up?  Now, do you hear your voice right now?  If somebody's agreeing with you with how you're doing what you're doing now, it's easy to go, yes, Anthony.  But if you're like, listen, I just think this and I think that and I think this.  It's the wop in me.  People are going to listen and go, yeah, I agree.  As opposed to go, yeah, I'm here to read no books.  Woo! 
[01:26:30]  And if she says, will you support Obama, please?  Oh, my God.  She's going to go, they're going to go, yes, we will, Mrs. Oprah.  She wanted some energy.  All right.  Let's go to Jack in New York.  There's a lot of great phone calls coming in.  Jack, go ahead.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm listening.  Thanks, Jack.  Yo, I feel like, Patrice, you're making it feel like that just because Oprah's getting more famous and more educated, that black culture doesn't want her at all because she's not ghetto.  They should look up to her and want to be like, because she's not education and stuff. 
[01:27:00]  They do look up to her, but what I'm saying is she's, there's a cultural difference.  When you're in front of reserved white people who are mostly reserved all the time, unless they're doing a dog to bounty hunter thing, which is, you know I say that word when no one's around.  In life, y'all are reserved.  That's like I said, when you party with white people, they just go, hello, and how are you?  And drink, black people like to go, yes, woo, woo, we ain't here to read no books. 
[01:27:30]  Fire off a few rounds.  All right, thank you.  We got to go to Anita.  She's a faithful listener of the show.  She calls from time to time.  Anita from Long Island.  What's up, Anita?  You know, I think black people should have been offended by her, you know, saying that she assumed that that's the way that they talk and that she would relate to them by sounding ignorant.  You know, I didn't hear the speech, but I would have been like, why is she talking like that?  I would have been very, very upset. 
[01:28:00]  What's wrong, Patricia?  Because you can hear this lady's Long Island-ness that she's trying to hide for this phone call.  And you don't speak differently with your friends, ma'am, than you do while you're trying to be very speechy right now.  You don't have a difference.  I hear the tone in your, I hear it, ma'am.  This is Anita, ma'am.  She gets a little worked up from time to time.  Yes, and she's going.  You know she's a black woman, too, right?  You can hear that.  Hell no.  Yeah, Anita's a black woman from Long Island.  You can't hear it.  You can't hear it.  You can be in Long Island. 
[01:28:30]  Other times when she gets a little excited, oh boy.  She goes, don't be reading no books.  Exactly.  Come on, Anita.  Stop.  Be reading no books, y'all.  Don't be reading.  I ain't here to plug no books.  I've heard a few different deliveries from Anita over the last year or so.  This is a different, see, she's laughing.  It's who you're talking to.  I don't know who she was talking to, but the demographic, look at the, do we have the,  reaction, O.B., from the people that she was talking to when she said that?  Yeah, we're trying to find the audio.  Find that audio. 
[01:29:00]  I'm sure it's laughing.  I'll tell you this much.  I just thought it sounded weird.  That's it.  I'm like, why?  I want to hear this.  I desperately want to hear this.  It's like, why is she doing that?  I mean, I would assume that there's a lot of people in that audience that are just as  educated as she is.  Why did she feel like she had to do that?  But still educated.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  You can go in front of an NAACP audience and go, I ain't here to plug no books, y'all,  because it's not saying, it's just saying, I know you know me from this part of life,  but I'm down.  That's what it is. 
[01:29:30]  First of all, she's not.  She's not down.  She lost her down years ago.  She's nowhere near down.  I think she wants to perceive herself as being down, and I think it's advantageous to her  to do that when she was plugging Obama to try to get, they want blacks across the board  voting for Obama.  Every black.  They want to do that for anyone.  They want what you call the Uncle Tom working for the man in a big building somewhere, and  then they want the street guy that they got to go out and pick up the night before, throw 
[01:30:00]  in a truck so he can vote that day.  The only black people who won't vote for Obama are savvy, political black people.  The average person, if there's a black candidate like Obama, will vote for Obama regardless.  You know what's a disgrace in the black race, I believe?  Constantly.  The black race?  Yes.  Constantly.  People are bringing up...  From what planet are we Negroes from? 
[01:30:30]  The planet Negrotron.  Negrotron.  Neegobots.  And, uh...  From what galaxy?  The evil Neegobots.  From what galaxy, Patrice?  Let's get into this a little bit.  What galaxy is it?  I can't even say the word because we're not allowed to, but you are.  Negromita.  Negromita.  Porkpie 12.  I think the most memorable quote by Dr. Martin Luther King is... 
[01:31:00]  What?  I am not allowed...  No, not I have a dream.  That people should be judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.  Yes.  And people...  And why don't you listen to that?  But no, I do.  Black people are constantly judging people by the color of their skin and not by the content of their character.  I'll tell you why.  I say this thousands of times.  I've said this.  No one cares. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, they're constantly bringing up Martin Luther King?  We don't hate you.  Mm-hmm.  You're not my oppressor.  He's not my...  We were left.  Like I said, Jews have a mustache they can hate.  They hate Hitler.  They hate his face.  They hate who he is.  We have your color.  That's what it is.  We don't like white.  If we can find the actual people who enslaved us, the dude on the little bike with the big wheel in the front and the mustache that curls, 
[01:32:00]  we can...  If we had a mustache, we would not hate you all.  But we don't like you because you're white, but you don't like us because you're black or whatever, because we're black.  Well, but because it's the whole...  I don't think we get each other.  I don't think we understand each other.  The cultures are so different.  But white people have nothing to get.  No, no, no, we do.  I understand white culture. 
[01:32:30]  I get it.  It is the culture.  Black people have a culture.  It's pretty much just whatever it is.  White people have...  We don't have anything that we don't understand about you.  But you guys have a bunch of things that we don't understand.  Yes, why don't you try to understand them?  We have between the gunfire, for love of God, what are you doing?  I'm talking about a little bit of assimilation.  We pick and choose.  We take some of your music. 
[01:33:00]  We take it from here and there.  Can you just love it and let us have it?  Patrice, I'm talking about a little assimilation to society without having the rest of black  people say, oh, he's kowtowing to the man.  All right.  There's just this huge gap between the two peoples that we have a hard time relating and  working together.  You have your sellout in Uncle Tom and you call it the left.  White people create it.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  You created this thing called the right and the left and now it's like left are the  Uncle Tom white people who like those Negroes and we the real white people, the right.  It's all wordplay juggling, man.  You guys got it knocked this day and age.  Knocked.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll do round three.  I ain't here to do no books.  Round two.  I think I'm just going to go to Starbucks and let you guys enjoy yourselves.  Oh, yeah.  Go to your whitey Starbucks.  Go to your hunky box. 
[01:34:00]  Or is it black bucks, what you want to call it.  I'm going to go to black bucks and get me some hot black coffee.  I'll take coffee orders and let you guys have fun for another 20 minutes.  Let's just agree to disagree and move on.  Jesus, talk about movies or chicks or something.  Hey, is Roland coming in with his top ten movies?  Now that we can all get together to hate Roland.  All right.  All right.  So I think we might have done the Oprah thing.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, that was about Oprah?  I think we might have covered Oprah doing the Obama thing.  We'll talk about movies.  We did football.  We did a little boxing.  Hey, we actually did some stuff today.  And we still have about an hour to go.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  I forgive you, Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  I need that forgiveness.  I threw Patrice O'Neill's plug away.  I'm sorry, Patrice.  I didn't mean to.  It's comics here in New York City.  Oh, I thought you were being racist.  C-O-M-I-X. 
[01:35:00]  Online.  Yeah, I'm there.  December 28th and 29th of this month's Friday and Saturday, two shows.  And the number's 212-524-2500.  Is it okay if a few of us white people go?  You know I like to come.  I enjoy you there.  Yeah, you enjoy.  That's it.  I enjoy you there and bring all the fellas there to make sure that I suck as a comic, as Eric looks and he's not impressed.  We're just as important to you as an appetizer.  I enjoy the appetizer, but all right, I'm done with the appetizer. 
[01:35:30]  Got to get to my meal now.  Get lost, Whitey.  You ought to come there, man.  Huh?  No.  I would like you to come.  A lot of white boys go and see Patrice O'Neal.  Yeah, I got white fans.  I know you do.  I got to be careful, but.  You killed on the Virus Tour this summer.  Damn it.  Hey, we were talking about movies during the break.  It's not our fault we got to stop for commercials.  I mean, the show just continues.  We were talking about Will Smith and I Am Legend.  That movie looks really, really good.  That movie is getting me excited as 300.  300 was the last movie that I was excited to see.  Yep, saw the trailer and went like, oh, got to see that. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, this I Am Legend looks amazing.  That looks really good.  It's like a retelling of Omega Man.  Remember the Judd and Heston movie?  Damn you.  What a great movie.  Is it?  I know it's a similar movie, but is it supposed to be like the new Omega Man?  I Am Legend is supposed to be.  Is it a remake?  No, it's like Omega Man was off of the movie, off the book I Am Legend.  They went off the book a little bit more.  This movie is supposed to be more like the book. 
[01:36:30]  More like I Am Legend, the book follows it.  Because in Omega Man, the villains were mutants, but they had a purpose.  Like they were people, but they just had a disease and they were figuring things out.  I think the villains here, they're like vampires or beasts.  Yeah, zombies or something.  Yeah, right on, man.  Yeah, so.  Well, it does look great, the trailer.  Like you were saying, Ant, Times Square with lines and stuff running around.  And he drives a pretty cool car in that.  I think he drives everybody's car or something like that.  It's just like, it looks good, man.  Drives a Shelby. 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to.  Oh, does he really?  Yeah, a red one with white stripes.  Does he really?  Yes, he does.  That's hilarious.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say there's going to be another human being alive in that movie.  Do you?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, I think there's going to be another person.  Somebody said Oscar already.  Some critics said Oscar awards.  People are crazy when they say that before the movie even comes out or anything.  Well, they've seen it already.  Before it's done.  Is it even cooked yet?  The whole thing?  They've seen it.  One of them critics on Martin Tomatoes was like, this should be Oscar. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, they said that about Evan Almighty, too.  And look what happened.  Oscar worthy performance.  As Noah.  Noah?  Steve Carell as Noah.  Look, I don't even know if Evan Almighty is good.  I have no clue.  I know it just did horribly at the box office.  And I think one of the reasons, that was a trailer where they finally decided, why don't  we just show the entire movie in the trailer? 
[01:38:00]  They've been heading this way for a long time.  Yeah, they do that.  But with Evan Almighty, you just knew.  There was no reason to see it after that.  Yeah, I hate when they do that with movies.  You go there and go, let me check out the previews.  The previews.  Or when you're at home and you go to do a pay-per-view movie and it goes, oh, preview.  Let me just check this out.  Dumb-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Oh, well, don't have to watch this.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You ruined the whole goddamn thing.  All right.  Just lay it out. 
[01:38:30]  They do like the beginning part and then they show you the twist where in the movie, if  you were just watching it, you would go, get out of here.  That happened?  What?  And then they show you in the preview.  It's like, oh, come on.  Hey, speaking of movies, in studio, we got Roland.  Roland sees more movies than anyone alive.  How many movies did you see this year, Roland?  Almost every one.  Almost every movie that's ever been made.  This year, though, I've seen pretty much all of them.  I thought he was going to say close to 100, but no, his answer is almost every one. 
[01:39:00]  Name one movie you didn't see this year.  I'm seeing I Am Legend Tomorrow, and I haven't seen that yet.  Why aren't we seeing I Am Legend Tomorrow?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Get yourself a ticket.  It's tomorrow night at 9 o'clock.  Oh, at night?  At night.  Oh, that's why I didn't.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Now you've got to read for a late.  And who can go?  I want to know.  Yeah, who gets to go?  Celebrities and people. 
[01:39:30]  How did you get to go?  I don't know if I did.  All right, listen.  Because of this show?  No.  Oh, okay.  Because of what?  Red carpet.  Yeah.  You do red carpet.  Yeah.  Do people go, Mr. DeLuise, Mr. DeLuise?  No.  Roland.  How many?  So you've seen every movie?  Almost.  Every major movie that comes out you see.  How many movies do you see a week?  Probably four or five.  A week?  A week.  That's part of the job, yeah.  Part of the job.  The job of being a lonely man. 
[01:40:00]  That's so sad.  What are you hiding, man?  Him and his helium balloon that he just sucks on as he's watching the movie.  What are you hiding that you have to see four or five movies a week?  He's sad.  You're sad.  Yeah.  You're looking for someone.  Do you go with people or just alone?  No.  Depends.  If my friends, they want to see the movie, everybody invites.  Do you have to pay for Invisible Friends seats?  No.  George Glass?  It's my friend George Glass. 
[01:40:30]  No?  No.  People do come because they want to see the movie early.  Yeah.  Tyler Durden sits next to you?  No.  Oh, my God.  That is the...  You know what?  I'm so glad I like white people stuff so I can enjoy that.  That is ridiculous.  That is the reference maybe of the decade.  And I'm so happy I knew that, man.  Because he looks like he has a Tyler Durden.  Oh, he's got to.  Yeah.  Who's your Tyler Durden? 
[01:41:00]  Sits next to you.  It's like a lesser Brad Pitt.  It's like a...  His Tyler Durden is a B actor.  It's like...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It wouldn't be Brad Pitt.  No.  It would be a chubby guy that's almost in shape and has a little more hair than he does.  Just a little better me.  Just a little better me.  What's his name?  Giamatti.  We need a chubby actor that looks like he could be in shape.  Paul Giamatti.  Paul Giamatti.  This is Tyler Durden. 
[01:41:30]  It's called Mike Club.  Yeah.  I might come.  I might.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Steven Ash from Bayshore has a very good observation or a question.  He asks, hey, do they project the movies directly onto Roland's huge, giant, sweaty forehead?  Oh, God.  Oh, that is not nice.  Oh, my God.  So his answer is he's seen almost every movie that came out this year.  So if you go four or five movies a week, you're well over 200 movies for the year. 
[01:42:00]  That's it.  Yeah, probably.  Because I see basically every movie nominee for an Oscar.  What's your favorite genre?  Um, I like chick flicks.  That's.  Oh, are you kidding me?  No, I like, I'll see action movie and chick flicks.  What chick flick did you like this year?  I don't, I could, you know what?  And I, all right, let me really try.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How Stella got her groove back.  Keep in love starring some actor from England no one ever heard of.  You just, you just, uh, named the stereotypical chick flick, okay?  But seriously, and I'm going to try, try to name one chick flick that came out this year, 
[01:42:30]  Ed.  Seriously, it doesn't mean you saw it and we could point and laugh at you, but I don't  think, I don't think I can even name one.  I won't name the names, but I can name what, there was one, I think, Catherine Zeta Jones  was cooking.  No reservation.  No.  He knows it.  I don't see it.  Was there a Sandra Bullock, uh, chick flick?  The lake movie.  The lake house is like last year or something, wasn't it? 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  She was in the, well, how about, how about something where Sharice Theron got cancer?  I'm sure something came out like that.  Yeah, it's the Valley of the Liar.  See, he knows.  He knows.  Wait a minute.  So what was your favorite chick flick of the year?  Once.  That's my number, that's one of my favorite movies.  Once?  Once.  And what was that about?  Did you just wreck the bit by saying that's your favorite movie of the year?  You did, right?  Probably.  That's the whole reason you're sitting there.  Yeah.  Nope.  But it's a chick flick.  And I couldn't let it go by because I just heard it. 
[01:43:30]  We just throw it out.  Once is your favorite movie of the year.  What the hell is that about?  What's it about?  Can we guess once?  Can we try to guess?  Yeah, let me guess.  Once.  Once.  Wow, that's a simple title.  It's very hard to kind of build something on that.  Someone is dying and they're taking a chance this time to enjoy the life that they, you  only get one life and they must enjoy it.  No, that's my number 10 movie of the year.  No, that's a different movie.  That's a different movie, but there is a movie like that, of course.  All right, let me think. 
[01:44:00]  Once.  It's the story of love between two people that only happens once in a lifetime.  No.  Shut up.  I got the plot here.  Oh, do you?  It's a great movie.  Sounds good.  Oh, please.  An unnamed guy.  A lonely guy that goes to the movies every day.  Is it, I remember seeing this preview and I remember thinking, what a piece of crap this  is going to be.  I swear, now that I see the stupid cover. 
[01:44:30]  An unnamed guy is a Dublin guitarist, singer, songwriter who makes a living by fixing vacuum  cleaners in his dad's Hoover repair shop by day and singing and playing for money on the  Dublin streets by night.  An unnamed girl is a Czech who plays piano and when she gets a chance and does odd, and  plays piano when she gets a chance, sorry, and does odd jobs by day and takes care of  her mom and her daughter by night.  Guy meets girl, and they get to know each other as the girl helps the guy to put together 
[01:45:00]  a demo disc that he can take to London in hope of landing a musical contract.  During the same several day period, the guy and the girl work through their past loves  and reveal their budding love for another through their songs.  This movie should come with AIDS.  It's a mixtape.  It's a film about a mixtape.  Can I have a large popcorn with AIDS on it?  You get AIDS.  Pump the AIDS on there.  I don't want butter.  Just AIDS.  Can you give me some extra HIV on my popcorn? 
[01:45:30]  Oh my God.  Tim, why is that your favorite movie?  Are you serious?  It's a really good movie.  No, it isn't.  It is.  Why is it good?  Well, the guy who plays Guy, Glenn Hazard of the Frames, plays the character.  Can I ask him this, Hobie, please?  Hold on, hold on.  I want to let him finish this.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  What's this, the song?  Yeah, that's the song from the movie, but it's a really good movie, though.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I enjoy it because it has a good story.  And do you cry?  No.  At movies? 
[01:46:00]  Do you cry at movies, any movie?  No, it takes a lot.  Do you wish you were the guy or the girl in this film?  No.  This is what I want to ask.  Roland, I know you must have asked him this.  I just never got a chance.  Are you gay, Roland?  No.  No.  And I don't mean that.  I'm not trying to attack.  I'm just.  I do not like any cock whatsoever.  No.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Not a faggot, no.  Why?  He double dumped.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  And do not get offended that I'm asking that.  It's just you've been asked that before, right?  No.  Or insinuated, right?  When does he not ask that?  I don't know.  They ask him that when he goes to Starbucks to get his coffee.  No dude likes once.  Even when no dude likes anything when it says love in Dublin.  Like you just go, nah, I'm not going to see that.  It has love in Dublin in it.  This is the song that they came up with that.  This is one of the songs in the movie. 
[01:47:00]  Are you sitting there like getting all teary eyed when this scene comes on?  No.  Does the whole song play?  Uh, yeah.  Probably.  Holy mother of God.  You actually sit there and listen to this crap song the whole time.  Probably as the credits roll.  No.  It's during the movie.  No, during the movie.  It's a musical.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Wait, it's a musical?  What did you think of hair?  Did you enjoy hair?  I didn't see it.  It's a chick flick musical?  No.  Well, hair is gay, but this is not.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dude.  Dude, musicals suck. 
[01:47:30]  Chick flicks suck.  You put them together?  Double suck.  And this is your favorite movie of the year?  Oh, my God.  That is that right there.  You go, it's a chick flick and a musical.  You could almost deal with one or the other.  And I'm saying almost.  Look, you could sit there and go, all right, this will be over soon.  But then you put the two together?  Are you crazy?  Is this better than music and lyrics?  Well, music and lyrics is a comedy.  It's shenanigans.  It's shenanigans.  Great.  Shenanigans.  All right.  What are some of the other movies?  We decided to have Roland come in and give us his top ten movies of the year because he's 
[01:48:00]  seen every movie.  From number one down to ten, I guess.  Sorry.  That's okay because who would have known?  But now that we know Once is your number one, this bit stinks.  Oh.  Well, Once is your number one movie this year?  We talk to guys every morning.  I mean, we love the fact that women are enjoying the show too, but mostly we're talking to guys  here.  There's not a guy out there that saw Once.  I'm sure there's somebody.  No.  The Academy people.  Oh, great.  The Academy people. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  And we know what kind of people they are.  Oh.  How was Beowulf?  That one I didn't see.  I went to go see There Will Be Blood instead of that one.  All right.  Well, give us your movies.  Top ten.  Let's go.  So starting with number one then?  No.  Well, just wherever you want to go.  Go back to ten.  All right.  Ten is The Savages with Felicia Moore Hoffman and Laura Lenny.  A what?  The Savages.  The Savages?  Which one's that?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You should only see movies.  He sees movies on streets below the numbers. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Question mark and exclamation point under people who live underneath the Lancy Street Bridge.  You're talking about those artsy communities.  The corner of comma and semicolon.  He left numbers and words.  It's like who saw Savage?  In between shopping for street art, he's going into these obscure movie theaters.  What the hell?  What is The Savages?  This is supposed to be a good pick.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  We know him. 
[01:49:30]  We know him.  Yeah.  Laura Lenny.  Where they get a call where they have to take care of their father.  Oh, my God.  Because it's crazy.  Give me the whole plot.  It's basically, it's like a brother and sister.  They're kind of.  It's a sister and brother, like you said.  Face the realities of familial responsibility as they begin to care for their ailing father.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That just sounds horrible, like depressing, boring.  Why is that good? 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Why is that good?  Wow.  There was a really good acting, and it's a good story the way they did it.  And this was the 10th.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is this?  Six is Spider-Man 3?  I bet it ain't.  I bet it ain't.  No.  Man.  Nope.  Wait, wait, wait.  Someone is suggesting here.  What's the star of the movie?  Who's the star of the movie again?  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Oh, now he's saying it right.  Okay.  Tyler Durden.  I can't believe you said Tyler Durden.  That hit me hard.  And does the father die in the end? 
[01:50:30]  Of course.  Don't worry about ruining it for anyone.  No one listening to this show is saying this.  No man cares about ruining the movie.  I always go, I have it at the end, and I still go see it.  Just ruin it.  The people that care are listening to Fresh right now.  Does he die at the end?  Well, you gotta see it, though.  It's a good one.  Oh, no.  No, I don't have to see it.  I will never see this.  All right.  I have the screen if you want to see it.  I will never see it.  I don't even want a free screening of my house.  All right.  Go ahead.  I don't want the effort of putting the DVD in my player.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  Number nine is 310 to Yuma.  310 to Yuma.  Okay.  I was thinking about seeing that.  Western.  What was good about it?  A lot of violence or what?  It was some violence, but it was just Russell Crowe and Ben Foster was really good in the  film.  How about Bingo Bales?  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  He was really good, though, as a farmer.  Yeah.  As a farmer.  He's always good in movies.  Can I ask him a quick question off?  Well, same topic, but I need to ask him.  The best superhero movie of all time? 
[01:51:30]  I enjoyed Batman.  The one with Christian Bale?  Michael Keaton.  Oh, my God.  The original Batman?  Are you serious?  I thought he said Batman Returns.  I was going to go, okay, Roland.  You can respect that.  Yeah.  Because I can be saying that's the best one ever.  Superhero.  Why are we doing this bit?  How about the original Superman?  That was good, too.  That was good, too.  That was the test.  He doesn't even really like that. 
[01:52:00]  The original.  The original Prince Batman.  Wow.  Christian Bale Batman might have been the best ever challenging Superman, the original Superman.  All right.  What's the next movie on your list?  Gone Baby Gone.  What?  Oh, Gone Baby Gone?  Gone Baby.  Which was that?  With Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck record.  Oh, I heard this is a good movie, actually.  It's a really good movie.  What is this one about?  It's where Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, they play private detectives trying to find 
[01:52:30]  a four-year-old girl when missing.  His brother, right?  He directs, right?  Ben Affleck directs.  Yeah, Ben Affleck directs.  And Morgan Freeman's somewhere in there doing that.  He plays a...  It's based in Dorchester in Boston, right?  It's really good.  Is Morgan Freeman reading the...  Is he doing the...  All right.  What's the word?  The narration?  No.  Is he narrating the movie?  That's his next movie.  That's the bucket list that he did.  Narrow Lawn Narration.  All right.  What's your...  What number are you up to?  Seven is...  Seven?  Where are you? 
[01:53:00]  Savage.  Seven.  You're 310 to Yuma.  Gone Baby Gone.  Yeah, and then the next...  No.  He did another one in there.  Oh, once was...  Yeah, the number one.  All right.  There Will Be Blood with Daniel Day-Lewis, the Paul Thomas Anderson movie.  What is that?  There Will Be Blood.  There Will Be Blood.  It's like Daniel Day-Lewis is a silver miner that goes and discovers oil and becomes this  rich guy and evil.  And Paul Dano from Little Miss Sunshine plays a creepy preacher that's kind of challenging  Daniel Day-Lewis with his oils in this land. 
[01:53:30]  How about that vampire flick when it was in Alaska and the sun went down for six months?  Oh, right.  Thanks, Josh, right now.  Days of Darkness or some number of Days of Darkness.  How was that?  It was okay.  I just wanted to know.  What's your next one?  And then we'll leave the top five for after the break.  Oh, goody.  Number six is Superbad.  Yeah, Superbad was great.  Superbad was really good.  I love Superbad.  I got that on tape and I want to see it, but...  You ever seen Superbad yet?  Not yet.  I just watched Bourne Ultimatum. 
[01:54:00]  Is that up there?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the Superbad on DVD, they have tons of extra, which is hilarious.  Cool.  Where's our copy?  Wow.  I got you one.  All right.  It is something.  When we get back...  The warmest blanket.  When we get back, Roland's top five movies of the year.  Can't wait.  Yeah, we can't wait.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On the Opie and Anthony show, we're in the middle of Roland giving us the top ten movies  of the year. 
[01:54:30]  A lot of questions coming in for Roland as well.  Lots of questions.  But we'll go to Charlie Westport.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, Roland, man.  I just want to say, you sound like the gay keyboard elf.  Not the smart one or the goofy stoned one.  The one that has gay written on his forehead.  And I got a quick question for you as well.  Don't forget.  All right.  What's your favorite sports movie, buddy? 
[01:55:00]  Ooh, favorite sports movie.  Sports movie.  Probably...  And don't do any blaze your glory, either.  That movie fucking sucks.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let me just lay down a little bit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's okay.  Probably Bull Dorm.  Bull Dorm?  Mm-hmm.  What's your favorite sports movie?  That probably is.  Bull Dorm?  What about Raging Bull?  What is that?  Kevin Costner.  Come on.  Tim Robbins.  Yeah.  Susan Stranding.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  I saw Once Not Gay.  Loved it. 
[01:55:30]  Chris in Jersey.  What did you like about this movie once?  Which, by the way, got 98% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  What's that?  There were like one or two freaking reviewers across America that didn't like this movie.  Which movie?  Once.  All right.  What did you like about it, Chris?  I thought it was for the artistry of the music.  Oh, yeah, right.  Oh, man.  I really thought.  I was like, wow, really?  Okay.  It's a chick flick and it's a musical. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, my God.  That is like two hours of pain.  I'd rather get Root Canal.  An hour and a half.  Get a Root Canal.  All right.  Let's get to the top five movies of the year for Roland.  And remember, Roland has seen pretty much every movie that was released this year.  Number five is Born Ultimatum.  It's a fun action movie with Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  What's your favorite action flick of all time?  Probably the Indiana Jones series.  That's fair. 
[01:56:30]  New one coming out.  High Heart is up there.  Lethal Weapon's up there.  Yeah.  All right.  Number four, Roland.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Number four, Sweeney Todd.  Oh, you've seen that already?  Yeah.  When did that come out?  It comes out December 21st.  What a Sweeney Todd, man.  It's Johnny Depp.  It's based on a play about an evil barber, right? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Revenge barber.  Revenge, where Alan Rickman plays a judge who sends Johnny Depp to Australia for six years.  And he comes back to seek vengeance on everybody.  He cuts up people.  Then he puts them in meat pies.  With a woman, right?  He's like down with this chick.  And I want to see that movie.  It looks good.  Tim Burton movie.  Got that same Tim Burton look.  Love Tim Burton movies.  It's really good.  It's super dark, but bloody.  There it is right there.  Sweeney Todd.  There's a commercial right on TV as you're talking about it. 
[01:57:30]  There you go.  It looks good.  So that is really good.  It's really, really, really good.  And that's number three.  Yeah.  I'll go and see it again.  Johnny Depp's in that?  Yeah.  Ah, that's got to be a bomb then.  No.  Teasing, of course.  Has he ever made a bomb?  Friggin' big, trash movies.  What was the worst movie?  He's made a couple of bad ones.  What was the worst movie Johnny Depp ever made?  He's got a good track record.  I think he's got a good track record.  He's a boutique actor, man.  He don't make bad movies, dude.  And the guy seems to be able to not fall into a part and then have to play that part every single time. 
[01:58:00]  That dude is, I mean, Donnie Brasco, man.  Yeah.  He's in great movies.  He had a crappy role in Platoon.  All right.  The radio guy.  I do.  He's like, he's a smart dude.  Yeah.  What did you say the worst movie?  No, I can't think of it.  No, that was good, though.  Edward Scissorhands.  Edward Scissorhands was a good movie for the time.  That was a little chick flick-y, though.  But if you have to pick one.  But it was weird enough where.  Or The Secret Window.  What about that? 
[01:58:30]  What was that?  Nick of Time?  Oh, that John Turturro movie.  That's right.  Secret Window with John Turturro.  Oh, Secret Window.  Stunk.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go with number two.  We just needed a stinkeroo from him.  Number three is Juno with Ellen Page and Michael Cera.  What the hell is that about?  It's an independent movie.  It's where Ellen Page and Michael Cera hook up.  They get pregnant.  Benny and June.  Benny and June.  Ugh.  That had a good soundtrack.  Thank you.  All right.  Go ahead.  What about that movie where the sunshine went out?  Where the sun was going out and they had to restart the sun? 
[01:59:00]  Truman Show?  Nah, the sun.  The Truman Show?  No.  The sun.  It was like a space crew had to go restart the sun.  It was, um...  It was a...  You know...  I don't know.  The sun was going out and they sent a space crew up to restart it.  Relight it.  Yeah, to relight the sun.  Oh, it was that Bruce Willis movie.  No, that was the one with the asteroid. 
[01:59:30]  Armageddon.  Oh, man.  Oh, is that that Will Smith movie?  No, no.  That was the Independence Day.  Hey, what's Juno about?  It's where, uh...  Juno?  Juno?  And Ellen Page.  The characters, though, they give...  They're in high school and she gets pregnant after they hook up.  And it's like the coming of age.  Oh, coming of age.  I hate coming of age.  I don't see coming of age flicks. 
[02:00:00]  It's a coming of age movie.  What does that mean?  What does coming of age mean?  Well, Ivor Ryman's son directs it.  He directed Thank You for Smoking.  He did this one.  Coming of age.  And any movie...  Coming of AIDS.  And any movie that's...  Watching those crappy movies.  And any movie that has In a Small Town...  So what happens to this pregnancy?  Yeah, see the movie...  No, we're not going to see these movies.  I'm not.  Juno is awesome.  I'm not going to give away the Indies.  Thank you.  Than will, though. 
[02:00:30]  Go ahead, Than.  It's a good movie.  Sorry.  Oh, you saw Juno?  Oh, no.  Did you go together?  No.  No, I brought a woman.  Oh, wow.  At least the appearance of being straight, Roland.  Oh, Jesus.  Watch out.  He's going to throw out more things that'll get dumped out of...  Yeah, to show his...  To show that he's a man.  Roland likes to show that he's a man.  He mans it up with some curses.  I'll kick your butt.  Yeah.  So what's Juno about?  And does the baby...  Just tell us what happens. 
[02:01:00]  She loses the baby.  They both die.  No, that would be awesome, though.  It's just she has the baby.  It's pretty...  What makes it a good movie, though?  It's just the dialogue's really good.  So it's a little too funny, knocked up?  No, it is funny.  It's just...  Oh, it's a comedy.  It is a comedy.  Where she wants to put the baby up for adoption.  The two yuppie couples, both Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, plays the couple.  Great.  What's your favorite scary movie of all time?  Scary movie?  There we go.  This is interesting. 
[02:01:30]  Something where a guy kisses a woman.  He runs out of the theater.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Roland.  His greatest fear.  My scariest movie?  Pretty Woman?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Halloween is mine.  Probably when I was a cast, all the Nightmare on Elm Street stuff scared me.  Yeah.  All right.  My scariest movie for me was The Ring. 
[02:02:00]  The Ring?  That's too recent.  How about The Exorcist or something?  No, no.  Because you go back and you look now and it's not as scary.  But that crap, like The Ring and stuff, that's like...  It's like...  You know, you fell...  What is it?  It took the bait?  I bought the hype.  You chopped at the bait?  The little kids don't scare me.  Little creepy kids are over.  The Shining, they scared me.  Those two little girls in the hallway?  It's over.  Creepy children are done.  The weird...  You could just smack them? 
[02:02:30]  Weird kids that are moving funny?  Yeah.  Cated.  They're moving a little too faster than...  Doing spider walk.  They're moving faster than they should be?  They're on the wall?  Any kid doing a spider walk up a wall?  I'm over it.  I'm done.  Oh, Lord.  Here come a little creepy kid.  Don't give me a scary kid under the bed.  I'm done.  Over that crap.  Creepy kids, they don't scare me anymore.  Hey, the movie's called Sunshine.  Did we tell the people that...  Sunshine.  It's just called Sunshine, and the sun's going out, and they have to like... 
[02:03:00]  You didn't see that movie over there.  Who's the star in that one?  The star.  Who's the big star?  I'm going to go with Sylvester Stallone.  Oh, did you see his face?  Or Rambo.  Rambo.  Wow, my...  He looks like Joan Rivers.  Yeah, he's really gone the...  His face is...  The cosmetic surgery route.  The guy's 60-something now.  Boy, what in God's name.  When did he get old?  I just turned around.  Yeah, and then he got old.  That's what happened. 
[02:03:30]  He wasn't old.  He just...  Cliffhanger.  And then I looked...  I saw Cliffhanger.  I like Cliffhanger.  And then I looked around, and I'm like, wait a minute, Stallone is old.  He got all old.  And he was doing movies that was going straight to DVD.  Yeah.  I was like, when did he be a couple bumps?  What happened to Sly?  He had a rough decade.  Was it a decade?  Probably.  Maybe a little more.  Why don't you allow Kevin Costner to continue?  Does he?  When do we say it's over?  Does Kevin Costner like...  Kevin Costner had...  Makes his own movies.  Well, maybe Mr. Brooks.  Kevin Costner started losing his hair at 25, and he's been the same age since. 
[02:04:00]  Guy hasn't aged a day and then 20 years.  What did you think of Mr. Brooks?  I enjoyed it.  It was a good suspense.  A lot of people didn't like that movie.  And then...  I enjoyed it.  It was a good suspense.  All right, what's...  Number two...  Did you like Pitch Black?  Of course he didn't.  The movie was great.  Why would you even ask that?  The movie was great.  It was a great film for what it was.  I like the second movie.  No Country for Old Men.  I want to see that movie.  Everyone's saying how great that movie is.  And what is it about exactly?  It's like Harvey Mbardon plays a hitman. 
[02:04:30]  He uses a cow gun to kill people.  And the pneumatic cow killing thing.  What's a cow gun?  They shoot a bolt into a cow's head like a big metal thing out of this pneumatic.  Pneumatic, like...  I love the Coen brothers.  I really think they make the...  It's pretty twisted.  It's a movie twice, though, because it's just like a little...  So what is it about about?  That's it?  A killer who kills you with a cow gun?  Can I read the plot outline?  I read it because this is another thing I hate when they describe movies. 
[02:05:00]  Violence and mayhem ensue.  Mayhem.  Ensue.  That's all.  Okay.  I just hate when they say ensue.  Well, Josh Brolin's in it.  He's really good in this one.  What is it?  What is it?  They're hunters.  They stumble upon dead bodies.  Yeah.  The movie has no music in it, though.  Is it out now?  It's out now.  I don't want to give out too much, though.  It's really good.  But what's the plot other than...  Basically, really quick. 
[02:05:30]  Hunters stumble upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin, and more than two million in cash.  Oh, you wrecked it.  And then the violence and mayhem ensue after that.  Yes.  Is it their best movie, or is Fargo better?  It's up there with Fargo.  Miller's Crossing.  Is it better than Miller's Crossing?  Almost, I think.  I'm cooperating here.  All right.  And your number one movie is...  Once.  It's really good.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  Jerry Lundergaard.  I love Jerry.  Fargo is a great...  Jerry Lundergaard.  Fargo is a great movie, man.  God, they make good movies.  Hold on.  Answer right into...  I'm cooperating here.  This is where Ant does his Fargo line.  Okay, darn it.  I'll go out and count them.  Right here in Brainerd.  Right here.  I thought we'd take care of it right here in Brainerd.  You know, right here in Brainerd.  He's got the 50 hanging out of his wallet.  What an idiot.  Oh, he looks like a nice enough fella. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'll fax those numbers right over.  No, okay.  Okay, send them over.  I'll send them right over.  Apparently, yeah, he was like skimming money off of the loan company.  And that's why he needed the money.  Yeah.  What a great movie that was.  Oh, it's just...  I could watch that every time it's on.  And that's the type of movie I don't watch.  Yeah.  And that's like, I'm into that movie.  That's fantastic.  I'll be like, blech, that dumb movie.  But I'm into that movie.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  And then when he's on...  No need to get snippy.  No need to get snippy here.  When he's trying to rehearse.  Oh, Wade.  Yeah, it's Jerry.  Oh, something awful's happened.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  Hello, Wade.  It's Jerry.  Yeah.  It's your daughter.  Oh, something awful's happened.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, I got to go to Hector.  Jerry, it's Gene.  I know.  No, no, no.  Sorry, sorry.  Stupid, man.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Hey, William H. Macy rolls in now.  You know what?  You didn't even need... 
[02:07:30]  I'm glad you said once as a number one, because if you hadn't said it as a surprise, you'd  be like...  Wow.  What?  Let's go to Hector in Connecticut.  Hector.  Hey, Roland.  Come out of the closet with me, you silly bastard.  And I want to ask you, if you got mail, is your favorite Tom Hanks movie.  Yeah, what's your favorite Tom Hanks movie?  Oh, well...  Forrest Gump.  Nah, I like Sleepless in Seattle. 
[02:08:00]  How about the AIDS movie?  Combine them both.  The AIDS movie is...  Sleepless in Philadelphia.  Oh, jeez.  I've never seen Sleepless in Seattle.  Ever.  I think I've seen it.  It's really good.  I gotta...  Yeah.  It's alright.  Best Tom Hanks movie is when he's saving part of Ryan, I would say.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Bachelor Party.  He was really good in that.  Bachelor Party is your favorite Tom Hanks movie?  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  I liked him in Bosom Buddies.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Best Denzel movie?  Ooh.  The best one?  Crimson Tide?  That was pretty good.  That was good.  I'm trying to think of the last one.  There's one before.  Yeah.  All I think about now is that finger.  Listen.  Is that Denzel?  Yeah, the finger that's crooked.  I'm thinking, wait a minute.  That better not be Lawrence Fishburne.  We're gonna...  Really, Roland, thank you.  Sit there.  We're gonna finish with you, but we got a Grammy moment here. 
[02:09:00]  We're doing Grammy moments.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony show.  In our own way.  Here you go.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Record of the year.  Beyonce.  Irreplaceable.  You must not know about me.  You must not know about me.  I could have another you in a minute.  Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute.  Baby.  You must not know about me.  You must not know about me.  I could have another you by tomorrow. 
[02:09:30]  So don't ever, for a second, get to dig.  Lookin' you're irreplaceable.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  The Grammy Awards, February 10th at 8 p.m. on CBS.  Yes.  Wow.  That makes me want to tune in.  Is he going to be performing that evening?  Feels like how Roland's singing some of the nominations on future Opie and Anthony shows.  Roland, your favorite buddy movie. 
[02:10:00]  A buddy movie?  Probably Lethal Weapon.  Midnight Run?  Midnight Run was good.  Midnight Run's the best comedy ever, man.  That was funny.  Yeah.  Best comedy.  Best comedy.  Oh, that's a tough one.  Um, hmm.  I don't know.  I just hate the fact that your taste for comedy kind of changes over the years.  Not really your taste, but like the way-  Well, 48 Hours used to be-  48 Hours was, yeah.  Just the-  When I first saw that, I was like, this is the greatest movie ever. 
[02:10:30]  And you watch it now, and you're like, eh, okay.  Animal House.  That Animal House, same thing.  It was like-  Yeah, Blues Brothers.  I used to love Jerk.  Like, I'm not a big fan of this new thing that's out, this new comedy.  This-  Superbad?  This stuff.  Yeah, this new thing where we're supposed to be laughing at it.  It does nothing for me.  Yeah.  I didn't like Knocked Up that much.  It was all right.  I don't see Superbad, but I already know I'm not going to like it, but I'm going to watch it because everybody else-  You know why Superbad's good?  The movie itself is whatever, but the guys are genuinely just, you can tell they're funny people. 
[02:11:00]  Right, okay.  And that's why I really like that movie.  They're just funny in this movie.  I don't even really- I couldn't even really tell you what the movie's about, really.  High school kids, blah, blah, blah, getting ready to graduate and go to college.  It's been done a million times, but these guys are just so funny in the movie.  They're funny people.  How about this one with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson?  Oh, I saw that, The Bucket List.  What is that about? 
[02:11:30]  It's where they're dying of cancer.  That sounds hysterical.  Yeah.  Shenanigans, they jump out planes.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, so they decide they're going to push to the edge.  That's The Bucket List, where they make a list before they die, what you do.  Do they die at the end?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They do?  Well, you ruined it.  Why'd you tell us that one?  Yeah, why'd you-  Geez.  Yeah, but-  A mainstream movie that people will see.  Yeah, but we can't wait to see once and see what happens. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, the great Patrice O'Neill, thank you for filling in for Jim Norton today.  Yes, indeed.  Jimmy should be back sometime tomorrow, I think.  I think we got Bob Kelly coming in tomorrow as well.  Comics Comedy Club to see Patrice O'Neill.  C-O-M-I-X, if you're looking for it online, he's going to be there December 28th and 29th.  A couple shows, both nights, 2-1-2, 5-2-4, 2-5-100.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  And your podcast.  Yes, patriceoneill.com, my podcast.  The award show is up now.  Ah.  Yeah, Patrice's video podcast, very funny. 
[02:12:30]  And Ant, where's your podcast at?  I just talked with Laszlo over the weekend, and he will be hosting it.  Really?  So, yes.  Will we have more info tomorrow?  Yep, absolutely.  All right, we'll do that.  All right, guys.  It was fun.  Yes.  We're going over to XM.  Have a great day.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Ah, here we are at XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, greetings.  With Patrice O'Neal.  Salutations.  I walk in and Anthony has glitter all over his body.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I'm all glittered.  Patrice wants to see the Brazilian girl naked today, desperately.  Oh, my God.  She's shaking her head.  She's like, ah, you saw me.  She goes, you saw me naked.  That's enough.  She's scared of you.  She's out there.  She's right there shaking her head like, uh-uh, ain't happening.  Look, you can look for yourself.  She's right there. 
[02:17:00]  I don't even want to look at her.  Why?  I don't want to look at her.  Why?  Because of a lot of things.  One is you just said she said no to a request.  Two is that she actually...  Wait, now she's saying she didn't say no.  She actually did that before?  She's done it?  Yeah.  What might she say?  She was wearing the coat when he said, just come into the studio for a minute.  Oh, I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable because I know I'm a piece of garbage.  She won't be uncomfortable.  She's one of the only people that made the walk today.  There's two people on the bleachers, her and some dude.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Patrice.  I'm really sorry I already did it before. 
[02:17:30]  And my boyfriend said if I did it again, he would not be very happy.  Your boyfriend that can't control you coming down here with that energy, he's trying to  control energy that he can't control.  This show, these men in this room, and I have to say, everything in here is bigger than your  boyfriend on a high level.  You're just being faithful and being committed to something that doesn't even exist. 
[02:18:00]  You can't even really control the situation.  It's like telling a tsunami to not get somebody wet.  See, I knew that.  Your boyfriend going, don't do that, man.  It's unattractive.  It's unattractive, and you have no use for it.  There's grown men here giving you grown men like, oh, my God.  How old is he?  21 like you or something?  He's 23.  He's 23.  He's a young guy.  He has young guy jealousy.  I have old man. 
[02:18:30]  I don't want to touch you.  I just want to go somewhere and dream about you.  He doesn't dream about you because you're his girlfriend.  You're his girlfriend he's supposed to be with.  He's some good looking kid, right?  Yeah.  He doesn't understand the evil of a fat middle-aged man who's looking at a little dream doll.  He doesn't appreciate your breasts.  You probably sit down to pee in front of him, right?  Yeah.  You're comfortable with him.  He doesn't care about you.  You're just his little teeny.  You're his possession that he's trying to control. 
[02:19:00]  It's over.  Just stop.  Yeah, I know that, though.  Exactly.  I enjoy that, though.  You really enjoy being kind of your little submissive?  Yes, I do.  I wouldn't do it forever.  I wouldn't get married and have kids so I could be controlled forever, but I like it  right now.  It's fun.  You're a submissive, as they say?  You like to be told what to do?  Not really, really, really.  Sort of kind of?  No, not really.  All right.  If you feel up to it, I don't know who controls this on YouTube, but I would love... 
[02:19:30]  You're obviously the one.  You got to understand, because my woman is like an old version of you.  An old version of her?  Yeah, she's an old version of who you look like physically, and I didn't meet her when  she was your age, so it's almost like you're making my relationship better by taking me  back in time to see what my girl used to look like, and I'm like, wow.  This guy's really good, by the way, but I'm still not going to do it. 
[02:20:00]  Okay, precious.  I'm sorry.  I would love to.  Yes, yes, yes.  But I feel kind of ranked today.  That's okay.  Like, what kind of underwear are you wearing, though?  Because last time you had on...  I don't know.  I think I might have the same ones on as before, actually.  Because you could at least kind of just show the underwear to Patrice, because he just  likes that.  That's like showing a bathing suit.  It's nothing.  It's really nothing.  That's like showing a bathing suit.  The pressure here is ridiculous.  It's really nothing.  It's ridiculous, like, what?  I know.  We'll take care of the boyfriend if he gets all pissy with you. 
[02:20:30]  Don't worry about it.  See?  There it is.  There you go.  Right?  Patrice, can you show Patrice he can't sleep?  Oh, Jesus.  Patrice's head's going to...  Just get her out of here.  Patrice's going to...  Patrice is an old man.  Just fucking get her out.  I'm not even looking at it.  Where is the boyfriend?  Why?  What's the problem, Patrice?  He's asleep, probably.  He works nights.  So, he's asleep right now.  While she's gallivanting in the cold weather, just hanging out.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much. 
[02:21:00]  Can you get her out, Anthony?  Ovi?  Why?  What's wrong?  What happened, Patrice?  It's just killing me.  You're...  Just get her out.  You're aching?  Because she almost...  Because this little asshole, and I have to say this, she pulled a pant...  Everyone else, to show panties, would pull it from the back.  She pulls down to show her smooth and shave area.  It's just clean as a whistle, and she pulled them down just a little...  Yeah, I had to.  She's a tease.  She don't understand.  This is what I'm saying.  You could be so fantastic if you understood.  I'm too old to be teased. 
[02:21:30]  It's making me mad to look at her tease.  So, now you got to see her, honey.  Yeah, I just don't want to look at her if she's not going to go for it.  You know, now you got to show him.  It's part of the rules.  Yeah, but...  He's right.  He really is right about that.  Good Lord.  Stop trying to control men with sex.  That's how you do your boyfriend.  You just got to make it right with everybody.  Now you got to show...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now you got to show Patricia Heine.  No, you control him with sexuality.  You control him with not giving him sex. 
[02:22:00]  You control him with giving him sex.  You control him with showing this.  You control him with, I don't know, little cute giggles.  That's fine and dandy.  It's fine and dandy.  It has its use, but not really...  So, how do we make this good, Patricia?  I don't know how to make it right.  She can't make it right for me.  So, you want her to get...  She can't.  I don't even want to get...  You just want her to leave?  I just want her to go.  I just...  Because it's just...  All right, go get your coat.  Yeah, go do your thing, sweetie.  It's not...  Well, she wants to...  She doesn't want to, like, leave the whole studio. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't want her to leave the...  Oh, I thought you wanted her to leave the building.  No, she can just...  She can sit somewhere out of my peripheral.  Is that okay?  Let me see.  She's yelling from behind the glass now.  What?  I feel like I can't really defend myself right now.  But I feel like I have to.  Everything is sexy.  She just makes me so sick.  She's so cutie.  She's amazing.  She's trying to make an excuse for herself, but it's not you. 
[02:23:00]  It's Patrice.  It's Patrice.  I understand that.  I know that.  That's what I'm about to say.  I have no problem showing my body or anything like that.  I wish I had more a gump to go ahead and just, like, whoo, and just take off my clothes  and go crazy.  Oh, Lord have mercy.  But I'm not that kind of person.  And the last time, I was kind of, you know...  She was kind of naked and stuff.  ...pushed to do it.  You was naked?  Like, they kind of, you know...  You was naked?  Well...  Not...  No, not completely.  The other girl got naked.  Yeah, she was covering her boobies up.  All right, what are you comfortable with? 
[02:23:30]  Because you are Brazilian.  You have that little third world harness in you.  I'd like to think that.  You're half Brazilian, half what?  I'm all Brazilian.  Oh, stop it.  But I was born and raised here, so I have the American mentality.  You have the mentality, but in your bones.  In your DNA.  In your DNA.  In my DNA, I want to do two girls one cup.  Is a slut, right.  You're shit in a cup, you little piece of garbage.  She's a two-girl, one cup.  You've got to be kidding.  So how far will you go, then? 
[02:24:00]  I don't know.  I'm not saying, without you feeling...  You understand, I am...  And I'm willing to negotiate.  Because what I am, I am using you for a mental image.  That's what I am using you for.  Yeah, I know.  You're putting me in your spank bank, basically.  Exactly.  Jerk file, as we call it.  So what is...  What are you comfortable?  Shoulders?  Because I can piece a chick together.  I do that.  Shoulders and then calf.  Calf.  See, this is kind of like the other reason. 
[02:24:30]  Like, I feel kind of unkempt, actually.  Because I haven't...  Don't you understand?  Stop talking to grown men as if they're teenage boys.  We don't give a fuck.  If you had another eye on the back of your neck, it would add to it.  No one cares about your unkemptness.  That's what makes it great.  What, does your underarm stink?  Gotta even be even better.  I think I have hairy legs right now.  That's fucking fantastic.  A hairy little dirt bag from Brazil?  Are you fucking joking me? 
[02:25:00]  Some filthy little stinking hairy little Brazilian girl shows something.  You think that's dirty?  You're being selfish.  Oh, thank you.  I hope you're brushing.  I hope you have funny smell in the back of your ears.  No, I think I smell great, actually.  The more despicable, the better.  Anything?  I do, right?  She smells real good.  Really?  Dan, she smells good.  Nothing.  Whatever you want to do, I'll take.  I'm not going to ask you what to do.  Wait, she smells a little bit?  Like what?  No, she smells fantastic.  Oh, okay. 
[02:25:30]  Smell her anus.  Jesus.  What?  That probably would.  A little funk.  Yeah, probably a little bit.  What are you willing to do, sweetie?  I don't want to ask you what to do.  I just came here to sit down and laugh and have a good time.  For free.  That's your problem in life.  You just think things are just, that's what happens.  You just come on in.  You're saying everything has a price?  So what are you going to make that guy do, that poor fuck?  He's already paid his price.  He's already paid life. 
[02:26:00]  I'm not going to charge him more.  You want him to see it?  Because he's sitting there.  Yeah.  Looking at her going, please, God.  Like his.  He's hoping you're a good negotiator.  He appreciates the situation.  That other guy's like, God, Patrice, I want to see how good you are.  Well, I guess panties is like bathing suit.  That's not naked.  So that's not breaking your boyfriend's request.  I'm really going to get murdered later.  How about the belly button?  Let me see the belly button. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You digging on that?  And it's super shaved.  How about, can you go down to where it starts?  Like right over here?  Yeah, to where it starts, or where in the middle, before he even gets to, like stop it before  it gets to.  Oh, God.  He has an idiot.  You'd have to do it.  Now, we're.  Wait, before it gets to the line.  Before it gets to the line.  Before it gets to actually, whatever the mountain part.  Yeah.  Yeah, keep going until I can picture it.  That's the line right there.  See, here it is.  We're like kind of playing by the rules so you don't get in trouble. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  So, what you would need to do is like, get that belt unbuckled, and then pull it down.  You guys are fucking, you guys must get laid every fucking night.  No, no, no.  This is why, but this is why you shouldn't resist, you should roll with it, because it's  almost painful to resist grown man filth, because you don't, there's no way to really  fight it.  So, just be nice.  Yeah, okay. 
[02:27:30]  And then the line.  There.  Wow, you can see.  I'm so far away from you guys, like, she's got a telescope over there.  And do you see the giggle and everything?  This is why I tell my girl when you get older, they can't even giggle, right?  You see how, like, an older woman has to step it up, because if she's sitting there going  like that unsexy giggle when she gets 35, she's sitting there going, and you just, it's  sexy to see her tease, but some old bra that doesn't learn. 
[02:28:00]  And she's, here's the line.  Like this bitch.  Oh, man, Patrice, that's funny.  All right, here's what I, all right, let me ask you, and you can negotiate, nothing's  for free.  Hey, if you need a book for school or whatever, let me know.  Let me ask you, if I can ask one thing.  Oh, right now, I just, I just graduated right now.  She doesn't even have a job.  No, I'm looking for one.  Just walking around poor and beautiful. 
[02:28:30]  Pretty much.  Okay, sweet.  Wishing for some work.  I isn't, and let's define prostitution.  Is it, is it to get paid to do anything, or is it just paid for, for sex?  Well, I think we can, you can play, let's make a deal with her.  That's what I'm saying.  If I say, look.  Oh, shit.  Look.  What, what, where are you living?  I live in Queens.  All right, if you get enough cab fare to get you back to Queens, get you a nice dinner  tonight, enough to buy you and, what's his name? 
[02:29:00]  Brian.  I don't want to know his name.  Who gives a shit?  Enough to get a meal.  You have a good meal and you, and a cab fare back to Queens.  I get to pick what I would like to see.  And I don't even want to see the cooch, because that's not even sexy to just see cooch.  What's sexy right now is if you go turn around and pull your pants down till, wait a minute,  till I start to see crack and meat, and you stop at crack and meat. 
[02:29:30]  Crack and meat.  You don't want to see where thigh meets butt?  No, thigh meets butt, just where.  Wow, okay, I'm surprised, I'm surprised.  Crack and above thigh meets butt, just the idea of the whole ass.  Wow, that's pretty tame.  It's tame, but that's where I've gone full circle.  All right, all right.  Just to imagine that. 
[02:30:00]  Renegotiation.  Go ahead.  I don't really need a cab ride home.  I hate the subway, but I'm fine with taking it.  Fair enough.  Dinner tonight, I usually cook myself, so I don't eat out.  Okay.  I'd rather be able to sit in here, actually, for the rest of the show.  That's what I want.  Wow.  That costs more.  And do what?  That costs more.  I don't want to intervene on what you guys are doing.  That is a huge negotiation.  I've never asked that, but I'd like to sit right there.  This is a national radio show. 
[02:30:30]  Hold on, we're done.  She just wants to sit there.  In the recliner?  That's easy.  Oh, that's nice.  I'm a little tired today.  I don't feel like sitting on the benches.  That's no problem.  That's easy.  I don't need to be on air.  Renegotiation.  Okay.  I got to be Hank Steinbrenner here.  That's not enough.  You are like Johan Santana, but I would have to say.  Oh, boy.  Now, yeah.  You ready?  I would have to say.  All right.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Silhouette.  So you change, turn sideways, right? 
[02:31:00]  Full down under the thigh.  So now you want to see where thigh meets ass.  The whole silhouette of ass and front nudity.  Like, so ass and front nudity sideways.  Not forward and not turning.  Just the angle of full nakedness from, and you can stop right there where, I mean, down  up below the coochie, below the butt line, but silhouette style, I'll be happy. 
[02:31:30]  For me to be able to sit over here.  That's the negotiation you made, but for me, that's a little more than crack.  Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.  You can sit on the fucking board over here.  You do what Patrice says, you can sit over there.  Is that it?  That's the negotiation?  Not at the table, but over there.  Comfy in the nice require.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Over here.  You can put your feet up.  And it has to be sexy.  It can't be like, okay, there. 
[02:32:00]  It's just slow downness.  By the way, Barris of Pittsburgh, Crack and Meat, the newest name on Whackbag.  Oh, Crack and Meat.  Dr. Crack and Meat.  So that would be silhouette, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I think I'm going to be single later, guys.  Ah, he ain't going to ditch you.  Believe me.  You're safe.  Don't worry about it.  He must not know about you.  Don't even worry about it.  Wait a minute.  And don't do the whole clinical thing. 
[02:32:30]  Do the other hand.  The other hand.  On the other.  The left hand pulls the left side down.  Yeah.  The right hand pulls the right side down.  And go slow and be sexy.  I just hate the fact that I'm wearing the same underwear.  That's it.  It's a month later, guys.  I don't think we had a problem with the underwear.  Okay.  Last time.  Yeah.  Now that's.  That's one side, right?  Right.  I knew it, so.  That's.  Oh, wait.  Keep going.  Do a little spin there. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Keep going.  Okay.  No, no, sweetie.  With the.  The left.  Yeah.  Every.  Yes.  Beautiful.  Now.  Now.  The left hand takes that other side.  The right side and the left side should match.  There you go.  No.  Not with that.  It's making me uncomfortable.  Because you're starting to look like someone who's a hostage.  Use the left hand and the right hand to wiggle down, my dear.  I can't.  I just.  I.  Can I jump in for a second?  Use lead bag.  He writes, can I request that she cries while she slowly pulls down those pants? 
[02:33:30]  No, you can't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think.  I think I did it.  Dad.  You did.  I think I did it.  Motherfucker.  What happened to not getting naked?  Now you're in trouble.  I know, right?  This guy's really good.  Now you're going to get me in trouble.  I don't know how you have, you're in a relationship, honestly.  It's a special relationship.  He's just, uh, looking for a new recruit. 
[02:34:00]  Or a new victim.  Patrice is still happy.  I'm fucking happy.  That's it.  You know something?  I'm very happy.  You shouldn't even have to worry about that.  Yep.  That's what you like.  By the way, I just want to say, we would have let you just sit there.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I know that.  I did it.  I did it out of the goodness and kindness of my heart.  Yes, you did.  Thank you.  Because you're.  I know you really wanted to see at least part of me, so. 
[02:34:30]  It's good.  It's a compliment.  You got one of those asses that, like, it's not like, let me see it as a goof.  It's like, let me see that.  And then it stays in your memory.  And she's tan in the winter.  Yeah.  She has a little tan line where it's, like, a little dark and everything's smooth.  Yeah, that was all, like, real smooth.  And it's a small booty, but it's meaty.  It had a meaty jiggle to it.  It's got that Brazilian thing to it.  It was great.  Pretty nice.  I'm going to fuck the shit out of my girl later. 
[02:35:00]  Fuck her stupid brains out.  She's going to get it, because I hate her so much, my girl's going to fucking get it.  Oh, my gosh.  Why was your birthday so good?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Patrice came in, like, just kind of skid-a-da-da.  Oh, he was happy and dancing.  Thank you, precious.  There you go.  Take a seat on the nice lounge chair.  Face it however you want.  Relax. 
[02:35:30]  There you go.  Floating on cloud nine this morning, Patrice.  And there's nothing this asshole out here can do.  There's just nothing he can do.  No one wants to say this I feel bad for.  I'm sorry, dude.  I just ran into, for my birthday, I got a gift from the threesome gods, and that's just it.  She was fantastic.  How did you find this?  Bumped into her.  Talked to her.  You know, did the interview, you know, find out, was she and the girl. 
[02:36:00]  Where'd you bump into her?  At, um, like a little Starbucks type of thing.  A little coffee shop?  Yeah.  Type of thing?  Yeah.  And that, you were able to make the deal like that?  Well, yeah.  Did she recognize you?  She might have, but, you know, I'm not big enough to be, it's not groupies.  Circle around like hyena.  Yeah, it's not, I'm not there.  So, basically, I'm still at the point where I can, I can feel like I did something.  Right.  So, basically, I talked to her, and you know, when you're in the moment, when you're, when 
[02:36:30]  you're counterpunching, you don't remember to fight, because I was counterpunching on  her nose.  Like, usually when you're offensive, you know, you know, I didn't have a game plan.  I just was going to go with what she's saying.  Of course, she says no.  And that's the first thing you got to, you know, you got to know the reply to no.  She's going to say, I can't, I, I, first of all, you can't or you won't.  Won't and can't is different.  All right, why won't you?  You got to understand that if you are a bisexual, and I don't judge you for being a bisexual, 
[02:37:00]  you got to understand that this is a situation where, you know, it's almost like two vampires  trying to find each other.  If, say, if vampires could live during the day, and you go, I want to find my kind, you  go look for your kind, and you go, are you, but you can't just go, are you a fucking vampire?  Do you bite people too?  So, it's like, if I go, are you into threesomes?  Are you into, are you into sleeping with my girl with me?  You can't do that.  So, we kind of, I worked it out, um, where I was like, kind of like, look, let's, let's 
[02:37:30]  just hang out first.  Because it is a, it is a good deal.  The only thing you have to think about in the deal, because I'll take you out to dinner,  we chill, drink a little bit, my house is comfortable, all you got to do, the tough part is, is, uh,  fucking me and my girlfriend.  Everything else is gravy.  Everything else is like, a fucking date.  But this particular girl was a gift.  A gift.  It was so amazing.  So, what got her to say yes? 
[02:38:00]  Um, the fact that she was a dirtbag.  Just like, um, little beautiful here, she's innately a piece of garbage.  It's just like, she has to be, she has to be convinced it's not her fault.  Like, did you hear the words?  I look for buzzwords.  Did you hear what she was like?  I was kind of pressured.  No one pressured.  It's just, you want to.  And so, I kind of got her to understand that this was a good deal.  Because she, like, the girl, and she did this.  She bit her lip.  She, she, anytime a girl does this while you're talking to her, she bites her bottom lip kind 
[02:38:30]  of thing.  She's a, and she's thinking.  It's tapping into something.  Like, her animal side.  So, I saw her bite her lip and I'm like, oh man, she's a little dirtbag.  And, and she's that age 23 too.  Girls say 23.  It's, it's something about 23 for me that I just believe every girl who's 23 is filthy.  She's, that's where she, she's starting to explore something.  So, anyway, she ended up going, all right, well, I might be on my monthly at the time. 
[02:39:00]  I go, whatever.  If you are, just still, I can't go, yeah, you bloody bitch, don't come.  It's like, yeah, come on through.  And, and whatever happens, happens.  So, what I did, I said, let me get your number and I give it to my girl.  I give all numbers.  I have no contact with this bitch.  Wow.  You can't.  That's the rule.  You just go out and kind of break the ice and then it's got to be handed over to the  next in command.  I slide the number to my girl.  I don't, the general comes in, but I don't train the recruits. 
[02:39:30]  I don't get up at five in the morning.  So, I go and give the number to my girl.  She has to, you know, feel comfortable a little bit.  Like, cause she's like, where'd you meet her?  Here's the number.  I told her that she's going to call this girl.  I said, make her feel comfortable.  I told her this.  I told her that.  And all my girl's worried about is, you know, the future of, are you going to try to fuck  her without me?  That's all she's worried about.  So, she calls.  The girl sets it up.  She goes, she's down. 
[02:40:00]  She's ready to go.  She's a fucking soldier.  Comes to, you know, where we going to meet her at.  And we had a couple of drinks or whatever.  Well, she had a couple of drinks.  Whatever.  You know.  My girl's talking to her.  We was chill for about a good two hours.  Wasn't no rush.  When it was time to go.  Let's go.  Let's go, ladies.  Get out of here.  Went to the house.  Nigga.  Let me tell you something, man. 
[02:40:30]  Sent my girl in the bathroom.  I said, listen.  She sat.  She sat.  And this girl was a submissive, too, which was, oh.  She just said, yes, sir.  She just did.  She saluted.  So, I said, do me a favor.  Sit over next to me because she sat on the love seat.  So, I'm like, sit next to me.  She got up, sat next to me.  Boom.  Okay.  Good sign.  My girl said, listen.  We couldn't go in the bathroom.  She went to the bathroom.  Come out naked.  So, while she's in the bathroom, I'm messing with the girl. 
[02:41:00]  She says, she's going to be mad if I'm not.  Don't worry about it.  Pull her shirt off.  Tits out.  I'm sucking her tits.  My girl comes out.  She's fucking naked.  Starts messing with me.  My girl pulls my dick out.  This girl went immediately down and starts sucking my dick.  You got to understand, in threesome land, you go, yay, in threesome land.  She went straight down and did her job.  To the point where me and my girl both looked at each other and went, oh. 
[02:41:30]  And my girl started getting competitive.  Like, oh, no.  I got to outfield this bitch.  So, my girl goes deeper than her.  While she's on my shit, my girl goes under her and gets on my balls.  So, I don't even see my girl's face.  So, it's, ready?  Here's where the magic goes.  This chick.  Instead of fighting for dick space, this girl gets up and says, you know, the way she moves, 
[02:42:00]  she doesn't say nothing.  It's just she goes, oh, no, I won't fight you for this area.  I will go behind you and lick your asshole.  Stopped licking my girl's asshole.  I said, motherfucker.  Oh, soldier.  She was, I hate even telling this story because I might betray fucking her again.  But she, I have to, I don't, you know, I'm trying to make sure there's nobody that can piece it together. 
[02:42:30]  This fucking girl was a trooper.  So, she, so, she's back there and licking my girl's booty.  And I'm looking at my girl.  We keep looking at each other like, who, who's this bitch, right?  So, she gets up, my girl gets, dude.  My girl gets up, sits on my dick.  She just follows my girl's ass. 
[02:43:00]  She pulls my dick out.  Starts sucking it.  Puts it back in.  Licks my girl's asshole.  Then licks my balls in succession.  Like, like.  Wow.  Rotating.  She, let me tell you why she was so great.  She fucked us.  That's why she was great.  She fucked us.  We've had, dude.  We've had a share of threesomes. 
[02:43:30]  One girl.  Woo-wee!  The slow clap.  She gets the slow clap.  Dude, one girl.  They're calling you the whore whisperer.  Dude.  Listen.  Billy Tyrant.  When you, sometimes you get a threesome going, one of your, one of the couple is getting  fucked more.  This girl would, like, almost have an internal clock where she would go, I think I've been 
[02:44:00]  on you too long.  I think I have to go to her.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  She's a little lonely.  Wow.  Well, fighting for dick space is a new name on Wackbag.  Fighting for dick space.  Barry from Pittsburgh.  But she just went like, uh-uh, uh-uh.  There's plenty of, plenty of other things to do.  And here where it gets even.  Oh, shit.  This is why you were whistling when you came here at five this morning.  No shit, right?  He's skipping.  Skipping.  We're doing something.  He's pointing at everyone like, hey, what's up? 
[02:44:30]  This is happening in my living room where I don't like people even being.  But it's just, it's full of juice.  And it's full of black people's sweat and pussy juice and ball sweat all on my good ottoman.  What happened to the days of the mattress in the basement?  Nigga.  Nigga, I got to stay pimp style.  You can't do that.  That's when you're 13.  And I got a little dungeon type of thing.  So we're doing this. 
[02:45:00]  Guess what?  She's on a period.  We never fuck her.  And she's still the best threesome ever.  Never fuck her.  Wow.  So I was so worked up.  I almost tried to just lick the clit on the top.  And I hate bitches on a period.  Like my girl.  So I was getting ready to lick the clit.  But my girl saw me going.  And she like kind of pinched me on the back of the face.  It's like, nigga, if you eat this bitch's pussy, what's your...  And you don't even let me stay at the house.  I said, fair enough.  We had an argument without even talking.  I went like this.  You made a fair point. 
[02:45:30]  We didn't even say nothing.  And so I went and got the magic wand.  The magic wand is deluxe style vibrator.  It's really one of them things that's supposed to be for your back.  But it's pretty powerful.  She took it on high.  She took it like a soldier.  And she just nutted.  She got her nut off.  My girl was kissing that.  My girl never kisses girls, man.  She was kissing.  And then we did the three kiss.  You know, all of us kissing shit, you know. 
[02:46:00]  Holy mackerel.  Oh, it was just...  Every moment I was going, I wanted to cry.  Like, you know, I just really wanted to cry how good a time I was having with this chick.  So, and my girl's a soldier too.  And she had to step her game up because she was like, holy shit.  This?  Because she was doing...  Usually my girl goes, get down on them balls.  Like, she has to tell these bitches what to do sometimes.  Directing.  Directing.  This girl was just, boing!  And she's, whoa!  Okay, shit!  So, I said, let's go in the bedroom. 
[02:46:30]  So, I'm finishing my girl off.  And this girl is just hovering around doing what she's supposed to do anywhere she can fit in.  My girl comes.  And then I like to just get my nipples licked and beat off.  That's my thing.  You know people are out there listening to this, right?  Ah, what are you going to do, man?  It is what it is.  It's not just us hanging out and listening to this shit.  So, so, so, licking my nipples. 
[02:47:00]  So, afterwards, dude, I'm jerking off.  And then I start kissing the chick.  We do the three-way kiss again.  Then, you know, I test it out.  I test it.  You know, I grab her by her neck.  And then, you know, a little spit in the face.  See what happens if she flinched.  And she didn't flinch.  You grabbed her by the throat.  Yeah, I know how to do it.  And spit in her face.  I just know how to do that shit.  It's not, it's just, I just slide it up the chest.  I know you didn't, like, grab her like you're ready to fucking choke her and shit. 
[02:47:30]  I got my hand around her throat.  And then I spit in her face.  And she just made that, that animal sound.  And then she pulled my girl in and asked her, could she spit in her face too?  So me and my girl are just spinning in this girl's face.  Holy fuck.  So how would you even know that doesn't just fuck everything up?  Like you go, yeah, what the, what the fuck did you, what the fuck did you just do?  What you do is you get her spitting some kind of way. 
[02:48:00]  If she's sucking your dick and you like, you just go, oh, just come on, baby, spit on it.  And once she too, she spit has been introduced to the game, to the game.  Spit is there.  Once she goes too, spit exists.  It's like the first guy to spit on the baseball.  And that's part of the game.  It's part of the game.  Tooey.  So afterwards we, it was amazing.  Like I, I came, my girl got right up and left.  She got right up and left and I'm there alone going, holy shit. 
[02:48:30]  Shit.  She goes out, she's been with women and been with men, but she's never been with a couple.  She says, how was I?  And I go, oh, I said, you are a fucking, you are despicable.  But I, you know, I say that with love.  In a good way, right?  Is she good looking, by the way?  She's a seven and, but she's up to a, she's easily for what?  Threesome, in threesome world, she's top level, top level.  Cause to be great in a threesome world, first of all, my, my girl looks good. 
[02:49:00]  My girl is on the highest level of threesome because if you look good and you got it and  you're down to do that, it's just, you know, but this girl, you know, she was, she's all  right looking chick.  Like she's all right and guys are going to hit on her, but her participation, her A for  effort, threesome world, A for effort, you can't beat it.  So she goes, well, how was I?  I said, let me ask you a question.  You got molested or something when you was a kid, huh?  She says, yeah, cause molested girls do that. 
[02:49:30]  They don't like to be touch gentle.  They, they're buck.  Wow.  I said, write your uncle a letter and tell him, thank you.  Let's go to Charles.  Uh, Charles, it's Opie and Anthony and Patrice O'Neal.  What's up?  Hey boys.  Uh, Patrice, I have hated your gut since I first heard your voice today.  I love you.  Uh, backhanded counselor.  Backhanded.  That is a compliment. 
[02:50:00]  That was an amazing story.  Thank you.  And he's full of shit.  He listens to you.  He just doesn't like it cause you're black, but.  So now back to the Brazilian girl.  She might be impressed now.  She's a filth ball, but she's so, here's the, her problem.  Sometimes girls that might look like that think they better deal everything.  They, they always are going to go and try to manipulate sex with, if she was to do 
[02:50:30]  a threesome, it would be awful because she wouldn't be a fucking animal, but she is one.  Oh my God.  She said it was great.  It was fantastic.  Thank you very much.  What do you mean?  I had a great time and I was the third party and it was awesome.  She, she's, she got hopes and dreams, this bitch.  It was awesome.  Um, I'm still friends with them and they love me.  She, she, she has hopes and dreams.  Yeah.  This little one here.  Yeah.  She's too young to even, she's just hasn't something, nothing's happened to her for her 
[02:51:00]  to even need to think she would need to be like that.  Hey, uh, yeah.  And be a other girl to be a couple's threesome.  She would be the chick that goes, I'm competing.  Like I ain't, I'm going to be the main.  She's not the other chick.  So for this story to happen and be interesting, she has to be a, the other chick and she's  not going to be the other chick.  She's, she's going to be the girl trying to figure out how to be the chick and it's  going to bore people.  And that's why things, that things fall apart. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, uh, Smokezilla from Kentucky writes, I'm leaving my wife after hearing this shit.  Guys are leaving their wives after, after your story, Patrice.  And then someone should.  They should if she's not threesome.  And Nick, uh, writes, fuck comedy.  Patrice should be directing porno.  I'm so fucking hard right now.  All right.  Well, I guess we take a break.  Now we know why you were so happy when you came in this morning.  My fucking birthday was fantastic, man.  Sounds like you had a great birthday.  What happens to this girl now?  Here's the big problem.  Engine reserved.  Where's she? 
[02:52:00]  Well, here's the problem.  My girl has to run it.  She goes.  Here's my girl going like this.  This is the difference between the wiring, men and women.  My girl's like, well, man, because I'm thinking we got us a sex slave.  We got like, well, when we need a threesome, we go, we sometimes we sit there and go, oh,  man, I'm going to do a threesome tonight.  Like, and then we go, oh, well, I got this little prospect.  This chick's like, what are you doing?  Take it.  Treat her nice.  Take care of her.  Boom, boom, boom.  Like, even going home, gave her 50 bucks to catch a cab. 
[02:52:30]  And, but we was going to drop her at the train to catch a cab from my house back to the city.  Didn't catch a cab.  She put her own money up.  The cab driver's like, it's going to cost 100.  So she's like, okay, I'll go.  She's going to put her own 50 up to go.  She's a soldier.  Nothing, nothing fazed her.  The problem is my girl, she's not a real sissy.  She's not truly a bisexual.  She's a trooper.  She gets down like that, but she might be 30, 40.  She's not really like, I love women. 
[02:53:00]  So she goes, maybe we can hook up for, I don't know, New Year's Eve or something.  I'm going, bitch.  In my head, like, Tuesday.  But I can't.  But I can't.  Fucking Wednesday Eve.  But I can't, like, be anxious to be with this chick again.  You can't be anxious, guy.  I can't be like, come on, sweetie.  I can't fuck you.  But it made me, I was, dude, I fucked the shit out of her yesterday just based on my new, my horniness got up. 
[02:53:30]  New pussy just makes you feel better.  And then you don't have to cheat on the bitch.  And you feel better.  Like, you got new pussy.  We were kissing.  Because sometimes you just like to have that intimacy with another bitch.  Like a serial killer type of shit.  You just want to be alone.  And she's like, that happens.  A couple of kisses, some intimate, like, into this chick by herself type of thing happen.  Uh-huh.  And now I can't be like, tomorrow. 
[02:54:00]  I got to be, I got to take it light and have her do it.  Or it'll fall apart.  It'll fall.  It'll, if I'm greedy, it'll fall apart.  So, I just took that memory and I'm riding it for a minute and that's it.  Let's go to Jay in Jersey.  Jay.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I'm in sales.  And by far, that was the best motivational speech I could ever give any of the guys I work with.  I want to know if Patrice trained.  Can you go to his sales training?  And trained.  Dan Allen Baldwin and Glenn Gary Glenn Ross. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, a lot of guys saying they jerked it to your story.  Well, good, man.  Because you should.  But it was, I was, that was the best threesome I ever had in my life.  And we didn't even fuck her.  No fucking to her.  Amazing.  Very good.  So, thank you, Jay.  On the rag.  No fucking.  And the best ever.  We got Brazilian girl on a lounge chair.  Dude is still on the bleachers.  Yeah, there ain't no way he's got anything to come in here with. 
[02:55:00]  Just let him stay over there.  Allie.  Let dude sit over there.  What?  Let dude sit.  They're the only two guys that showed up for the walkover.  Two guys?  Oh, like people.  Two guys meaning, yeah, two listeners, whatever.  Keep him out of my fucking sight, though.  Be nice.  I don't mean like out of my sight, like stay out of my sight.  Like out of my line of view.  He's over there.  He'll be over there.  Be nice.  Be nice?  Look who's fucking saying be nice. 
[02:55:30]  Me.  Why?  I saw Extreme Home Makeover last night.  I'm a little emotional.  Let the guy come in.  All right, we'll continue in just a bit.  Patrice O'Neill, comics, 28th and 29th.  And he'll do a whole thing on how you pick up women, I believe.  That'll get the fuckers in there.  Place to be packed.  No one will fucking even chuckle.  It'll just be like silent.  How great would that be?  With some heavy breathing.  That's your angle.  They're just lined up down the sidewalk trying to get in.  Just to hear. 
[02:56:00]  And I get into it a little bit.  Someone had a name for your book.  And if you ever write a book.  Let me see if I can find it real fast.  That's gone.  Oh, well.  But you can't tell somebody the result.  You almost have to get into how.  Like these guys that I'm going to leave my wife.  Don't leave your wife.  She wants leadership.  Don't leave her.  Just lead her.  You know what I mean?  So where she goes, all right, I'll try it.  And then she's going to do it. 
[02:56:30]  All right, hold on.  Mike from Long Island's got the other side of the story.  Mike, how it goes bad.  Yes, Mike.  Okay.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Listen, Patrice, hearing your story, it made me cry, man.  My wife, about two years ago, before we had our first son,  she hooked up with this girl online.  I met her out of Okie Dokie's out in Patchogue.  Okay.  Now, I'm home alone, you know.  I know my wife's going out to meet a new person,  and she's out with her friends because she didn't want to go by herself  because she wasn't that comfortable at first.  But she comes home.  I'm laying in bed.  My wife comes in a little, you know, half in the bag. 
[02:57:00]  And the first thing she does is put her fingers under my nose,  and I take a whiff.  Instant boner, all right?  So me and my wife go out all night.  The next day, I go into my wife's AOL account,  and I look for this girl.  I find her email address.  I fucked everything up, Patrice.  I emailed this girl.  It was hounding her, it was hounding her.  Greedy.  And then my wife got an email back saying,  listen, your husband's getting too eager.  I was eager to be for her.  Greedy, nigga. 
[02:57:30]  Exactly.  You can't be.  That's why I don't want any contact with him.  I'm the general.  I don't train the troops.  You need a lieutenant.  You have to train.  Let me tell you something.  Even pimps have a girlfriend that they love.  Nobody pimps ten bitches.  You talk to one.  My girl is in my army.  And I say, look, I follow protocol, man.  I want to call this chick and go doo-doo-doo,  but I'm not.  I would never do it because it fucks up everything.  Why not have... 
[02:58:00]  It's better to have a threesome a month or two  than to not have one ever again.  You know Obama's going to be calling you, right?  He should have a threesome, too.  Obama's going to be calling you.  You're going to have to...  We'll swap with his wife.  I'll back his wife.  Screw Oprah.  Screw Oprah.  You're going to be on the campaign trail with Obama.  He'll turn everybody around.  It really is a technique.  And I'll tell you one thing that made me really...  That my girl didn't get pissed off about kissing this broad. 
[02:58:30]  That's when it was beauty.  Hey, Damien, this was Damien Thomas  from Akron, Ohio.  Fighting for Dick Space.  The Patrice O'Neill story.  New York Times bestseller.  Fighting for Dick Space.  She wouldn't do it.  Nope, nope.  You have all that area.  Excuse me.  I'll go behind you.  So if you're going to go to Patrice's show at Comics,  bring a notebook, take notes,  maybe a little tape recorder.  You're going to want to remember every word.  What is it?  28th and 29th?  Yeah.  Comics in New York City?  Yes, sir.  C-O-M-I-X for info on the internet. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  We'll continue.  Opie, Anthony, Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Rolling right along.  Patrice O'Neill entertaining the fuck out of us today.  And Anthony talking about his Friday night  with the JÃ¤germeister.  The big party down there at what, Bar 9? 
[02:59:30]  Bar 9, wow.  Is this a booger on our cut sheet?  Don't flick it.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, fucking JÃ¤germeister, man.  You know, I don't know what it is.  I think it was the sheer amount of it.  I've done shots of JÃ¤ger.  Been fine.  But this was like, the second a few people saw me  doing a shot of JÃ¤ger, they assumed that they had  to buy me shots of JÃ¤ger.  And I was drinking Bud Light, so it wasn't like I was 
[03:00:00]  drinking Jack and Cokes and JÃ¤ger.  So I'm drinking Bud Light, feeling okay.  Which is like water to you, really, right?  Yeah, a couple of times I felt, you know,  I was double fisting them, though.  Bud Light's easy for it.  Yeah, Bud Light, I like it.  I could drink all fucking night.  But then I do a shot of JÃ¤ger, and then another one  comes up, and then a couple of guys want to do a shot  with you.  And normally I'm pretty good with knowing I can't do  this much JÃ¤ger.  So I'll grab a shot, do it, put the other shot down on a 
[03:00:30]  table, walk away.  I've had, and this is just a trick you've got to do being  somebody that people want to drink with.  I've had the empty beer bottle in one hand, and the shot in  the other.  And I'll do a shot, make it look like I'm chasing it with the  beer, and then spit it out in the bottle.  It means a survival.  The guy goes away happy thinking he did a shot with him, and I'm  not fucking in the bathroom of Bar 9 throwing up like I was  Friday. 
[03:01:00]  You were throwing up?  Dude, like common scum.  I loved it.  I was puking in the bathroom of Bar 9.  Wow, really?  Like common scum, like a square.  I fucking was LSD drunk.  You know what the worst thing about Bar 9 is?  You go downstairs to the bathroom.  So you've got to go back upstairs.  So I'm trying to go upstairs, and something is telling my brain  that I'm leaning too far forward.  So I'm leaning backwards, and I'm holding on to the banister, 
[03:01:30]  just going, I can't fucking make it up these stairs.  And thank God my friend Joe Curry's there.  He's kind of pushing me.  How'd you get home?  I've been in that situation.  I hop in my fucking car.  I don't have to walk.  I drive.  No, how'd you get home?  I'm kidding, motherfucker.  I stayed at a hotel.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, at that point, there's no fucking driving.  Believe me.  But Joe Curry had been in that situation years ago.  I love how he says, at that point.  At that point.  But there's many...  I'm a great drunk driver.  Believe me.  I'm very good at it. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my God.  That's why I had to slow down.  Well, at that point, there's other points, you can still drive.  I know my limits.  I know when I'm too drunk to drive.  But after a few drinks, I drive fine.  I'm very good.  I actually adhere to the speed limit, for the most part, unless we're racing from Queens  into Manhattan.  That was a day I shouldn't have been driving.  But for the most part, if I've had a few drinks, and I'm driving, I won't speed.  I won't drive like a maniac changing lanes. 
[03:02:30]  I drive safer than when I'm not drinking, drive like a maniac.  But, yeah, I drank.  Joe Curry was there.  And he'd been in the same situation once.  And he told me, like, I was taking him into the house one night.  And he goes, Ant, I completely know what's going on.  I know we're going into the house.  You're fucking, you know, we left the bar.  He goes, but I just can't fucking walk.  It's like, okay, we'll get you in there.  And I was in that situation where I couldn't fucking, like, walk. 
[03:03:00]  So then I try to get up the stairs.  And then again, it starts hitting me.  So I go back into the bathroom.  And I was in there for a while between puking and napping.  You were sleeping in the bathroom?  Yeah, yeah.  And then it's like common scum.  Like common scum.  Jesus, man.  Just common scum.  But then when I woke up, I felt much better.  I was able to circumnavigate my way out of the club into a cab and to the hotel. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  It was an adventure.  Just too much JÃ¤germeister.  It was much too much JÃ¤germeister.  Is this something you want to talk about over here?  Where is that?  On instant feedback.  I can't find it.  Where is it?  Second one down.  Oh, my God.  I'm not a faggot.  No, not the faggot one.  Oh, man.  Did you?  What?  Have him tell you about... 
[03:04:00]  That didn't happen.  Jesus Christ.  Are you sure?  I'm positive.  Have him tell you about licking his lady's ass while the girl ate her pussy.  Wow.  No.  He was over the pants.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Did that happen in?  No, it didn't.  I swear.  At one point, someone had a tray of JÃ¤ger shots in front of Ant while he was singing,  and he just... 
[03:04:30]  He was just tossing the glasses on the ground.  He was just tossing the glasses on the ground.  He walked out fine, yeah, after hours of throwing up and sleeping.  Ha, ha, ha.  Just that black liquor.  Yeah.  Oh, when you puke that stuff up, too, it looks like a horror movie.  How many do you have to drink to get like that?  I can't even tell you how many I had.  And why'd you throw up?  I thought you wasn't mixing it with nothing, was you?  Just too much JÃ¤ger.  Just too much volume.  I had too much fucking JÃ¤ger.  And I could drink JÃ¤ger if I spread it out over the night, just a couple of shots. 
[03:05:00]  Does it go down smoothly, JÃ¤ger?  Then I'm fine.  Yeah.  I have no problem.  It's got to be icy cold, though.  Don't like the JÃ¤ger.  And then with the beer.  It's fine.  But this was a nonstop fucking conga line of people coming up to me going, shots, shots,  shots, shots.  I'm like, okay, okay, okay, okay.  And then one second, I'm singing.  And thank God I was done singing.  So I get off there.  And that was pretty much when I went, wow, holy shit, I am fucked up.  Now, is JÃ¤ger a liquor as vodka is? 
[03:05:30]  Or it's some other shit that you mix with?  What is that?  It's pretty much for just shots.  I don't know what drinks you make with it, but it's pretty much a shot drink.  It's a liquor of itself, though.  It's like vodka or gin.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a liquor unto itself.  It's syrupy.  Oh, my God.  It's almost like if you were to do shots of Southern Comfort, something like that.  You don't have to mix it with anything.  And what do you call it?  It's just liquor or liquor or whatever. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Chester's Liver is saying that you had five on stage alone and you were only up there for  15 minutes tops.  Dude, yeah.  Because people were coming up just handing them to me.  Wow.  And you was busting them down.  Oh, bam.  They were going.  Now, what happened to your self-esteem that night where you just was like, fuck it.  I'm going to kill myself.  I don't know.  Because that's what happens.  You just go, fuck.  I do that with my diabetes sometimes.  Like, I'll taste a donut.  You're almost sick of being so good and you're like, you know what?  Fuck it.  Fuck that nigga.  Box of donuts up in this bitch. 
[03:06:30]  So what happened to you where you said, fuck it.  I'll die.  Here's what it was.  It was Friday night.  Right.  I had a room already booked at the hotel.  I knew I didn't have to be anywhere until here on Monday.  Right.  So I'm like, you know something?  I'm not driving.  I'm just going to fucking get fucked up.  Fuck it.  But I didn't think I'd get that fucked up.  See, my going out and drinking.  There's going out and drinking.  But there's a bigger.  Where I get a buzz.  Anthony, there's a bigger. 
[03:07:00]  For you to get like you did.  Because you say you have a way of controlling that.  Yeah.  And you spit it in the bottle.  Because you know that you really shouldn't be doing that.  What the fuck happened where you was like.  Yeah, he knows the tricks.  You was depressed or something.  What happened?  I don't know.  No, I honestly don't know what the fuck it was.  He just likes his drinking.  No, it's not even that.  I like drinking.  But I don't like fucking getting like that.  Right.  He got.  Obi, he killed it.  He tried to kill himself.  I went over the precipice.  All right.  So why did you get like that?  I don't know.  Now I'm with Patrice. 
[03:07:30]  You did the drummer from Leonard.  Well, not Leonard Skinner.  The drummer from.  The who?  Not the who.  Who died on his bottom?  Oh, Jason Bonham.  Jason Bonham.  I mean, not John Bonham.  What is he from?  He's from.  Fucking Zeppelin.  Zeppelin.  Like you was that.  That's the kind of drunk you was.  Like you had to make sure you didn't lay on your back drunk.  Here's what happens.  Here's what happens though.  I'll go out and drink and I'll get a buzz.  I'll get drunk or whatever and be fine.  Then I'll go out and drink and, and know that I have the possibility. 
[03:08:00]  There's the potential there of getting really fucked up.  And that's when I take my precautions.  Okay.  Then there's, I want to get fucked up.  And that's where you are.  After, after I, yeah.  No, wait.  You didn't start there though.  No, I did.  I said.  You started with, I'm getting fucked up.  Yeah, because it was Friday.  I didn't have to be anywhere.  The next day could be spent totally sleeping off a hangover.  So you just started out.  The fact that Jaeger was introduced was the only thing that was spontaneous is that.  But I never wanted to get as fucked up as I did.  But since I wanted to get fucked up, I passed the point of being able to tell myself, be cool and responsible. 
[03:08:30]  So then they just kept going.  By the way, Ant's line.  He asked for the shots while on stage.  Yeah.  I was already fucking tooled.  I had already like pounded a lot of shots.  I went, walked in there.  I can't believe people are fucking writing in to make sure he doesn't lie.  Like it's like, nah motherfucker, he did this.  Dude, I'm saying I fucking fell asleep and puked in Bar 9's bathroom.  Oh boy.  What more do I need to tell you? 
[03:09:00]  He's trying to like keep it between him.  Ah, whatever.  The first thing I did when I walked in there was ask for a Bud Light and a shot of Jaeger.  The first thing?  That was the first fucking thing.  You were setting up the night.  So I was, yeah, I was setting up the night and then that was it.  And then Saturday, I woke up Saturday in the hotel, fucking, I wanted to jump out the window.  My head, jackhammer.  I was fucking, the chills, nauseous.  And it lasted all fucking day. 
[03:09:30]  I've never been drunk in my life, so I've never been, maybe once in my life.  Drunk rules.  What happens?  Hangover.  What's a hangover?  Like what happens to you?  It's the worst.  Your body has been poisoned.  Literally poisoned.  And that's the after effect of the poison.  It's the final effect of the poison.  So it's your body trying to fight the toxins.  Yeah, fighting the toxins, being dehydrated.  Your blood vessels have constricted.  It's the worst fucking feeling.  You have this bad headache. 
[03:10:00]  Your eyes, you can't move your eyes right without them fucking hurting.  And you constantly feel like you're going to puke.  You're nauseous, queasy, your equilibrium's all off.  Oh my god, so before this happens, you have to say to yourself, is this worth what's going  to happen tomorrow?  Thank you.  Yes.  Oh dude, if you could figure that out, you know, you'd be a fucking billionaire.  It's the only thing that keeps me from fucking being drunk 24 hours a day, is knowing that 
[03:10:30]  I feel like shit the next day.  So if I want to have a couple of beers, I'll have a couple of beers, and then go, that's it.  No, is it a different kind of hangover for a different kind of liquor?  Yeah.  Red wine, fucking just shoot yourself in the head before you go to sleep.  Red wine hangover is the fucking worst.  Are you serious?  You don't want to wake up with a red wine hangover.  It's all the shit that's in there that makes the wine that just fucks with your body.  Most people would say red wine is the worst hangover.  They say lighter booze is better.  So vodka would be better than Jack Daniels. 
[03:11:00]  Uh, Jaeger, probably the worst, a lot of sugar in it, things like that, that'll...  Are you serious?  Uh, yeah.  Like, so what, now, red wine, I've seen people drink a bottle of red wine by themselves.  And they probably feel like dick the next day.  Really?  Yeah, that's getting there.  A bottle by yourself is getting there.  Beer is okay.  Beer, you spread it out all night, no fucking problem.  Now, can you get, uh, is there a drunkness that's, like, alright, I'm, I'm drunk, I'm  having a good time, I'm drunk, and you not wake up with a thing, with a, with a, you 
[03:11:30]  like, you only wake up with a hangover after you just abuse yourself?  Everyone's different, but there are people that, yeah, drink and don't have a hangover,  or they can get over it real quick.  I'm a motherfucker, 24 hour hangover.  I will be fucked up, that's if I'm, like, drunk.  So you're just now feeling okay?  I suck.  No, yesterday I was feeling pretty, pretty okay.  I was real, like, woozy, though.  Uh, but, um, you know, then I ate something.  That is fucking crazy.  And I can't eat the whole fucking day.  Can't eat. 
[03:12:00]  Gotta drink.  There it is.  Look at that.  Look at that fucking shot.  There's a shot.  There's a tray of Jaeger that I am being handed.  In the middle singing.  And look at you still trying to have your, your dignity and have your pinky up.  I have my little pinky and finger up as I grab it with my thumb and mid-finger.  Look at the raw enthusiasm on your face, though.  I'm really fucking into whatever song we're doing.  And that tray, uh, believe me, I didn't have just one off of that tray.  I think I grabbed a couple, slammed them down, and then threw the glasses. 
[03:12:30]  Hey, Sarah from Philly.  Ooh, that was bad.  She writes, uh, Chester's Liver says, I have video of Ant on stage, and he goes to say,  can I get a shot before this song?  But it comes out, can I get a song before this shot?  Ant ruled on Friday.  All right, go fuck yourself.  I could have done that sober.  And we got a really good question coming in from Westchester.  Scott, go ahead.  Hey, Ant, I just had a quick question.  I was just wondering if you woke up wearing your fruit basket again.  No, no, I didn't wake up wearing fruit.  That was bad.  So Patrice is kind of amazed over there. 
[03:13:00]  We've heard a few of these stories in the last, uh, I don't know, four or five months  from when.  When you're drunk, uh, let's see, where was that?  I think that was, um, Atlantic City?  Yeah.  Atlantic City.  And I, I was really hungry.  So I go back to the room and, um.  Now, do you, wait, do you have to have food?  I'm really, I know I sound like a fucking sissy.  No, no, no.  But I just don't drink.  No, you sound like a reasonable, sensible fellow.  Like, you do, you have to have food on your stomach before you drink.  Before is very good.  Very good.  And don't you take high blood pressure medicine? 
[03:13:30]  No.  No, my blood pressure's fine.  You don't take, like, medicine or nothing?  Like, to make you, like, no medicine at all?  No, I, I take, uh, uh, Lipitor for cholesterol.  This doesn't, of liquor doesn't.  Nah.  Liquor, black licorice liquor doesn't fuck with that at all.  Nah.  Let's go to.  I work out like an animal and I eat, I eat right.  I just don't even know, dude.  I don't eat like shit.  Let's go to Big Kev.  Big Kev.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, uh, back in the N.E.W. days, Anthony, you may recall. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Uh, there was a couple of occasions after, uh, some road shows where I was driving, uh,  Anthony and his girlfriend home.  And, uh, uh, one time he very calmly sat up from my back seat and said, Kev, I need you  to pull over because I, I have to, I have to pee.  I'm like, okay.  So he pulled over and Anthony proceeded to get out and vomit.  Just like projectile vomit about 15 feet away from my car.  Always out of the car though. 
[03:14:30]  Then a second time, uh, I was driving Anthony home.  He sat up very calmly and said, Kev, I need to pee.  Got to pull over the car.  I said, okay.  He goes, now listen, I do not have to vomit.  And I said, all right, no problem.  So we pulled over and the Anthony very calmly got out of the car, walked over and, and just  bent at the waist and vomited on his shoe.  It was getting up.  I think I'm not a good, real heavy drinker.  Can I, I'm a great light drinker now do drugs. 
[03:15:00]  I know I'm sounding like a square for what I do.  No, that's fine.  I just, I just, I abuse myself differently.  Yeah.  So marijuana, cocaine, any of that stuff.  Do you have the, the next day hangover effect of just like smoking a weed?  Not pot or anything, but you'll just smoke more pot.  Other than addiction.  Coke, you'll feel the next day.  Yeah, right.  You'll have like a Coke hangover.  Coke last night.  But nothing is as bad as booze for a hangover. 
[03:15:30]  It just, it's the worst fucking constantly feeling like shit.  There's no real way.  And the only way to get rid of it is to drink more.  So you can throw up, right?  No.  If you don't throw up, then you'll feel better.  If you could get one beer down when you're hungover, you're, you're on your road to the  next night of partying.  But you know what that's like?  That's right.  It's, it's almost like, uh, giving you, when they give you a flu shot, it's really giving  you the flu.  The flu. 
[03:16:00]  That's what you got to do.  You got to give yourself the drunk.  So you're building up your immune system to liquor.  Yeah.  That's what you just, yeah.  That's pretty much what it's like.  Which almost makes you, you have to, so to get drunk, you have to almost abuse yourself  doubly next time because your body now created something to control the.  Alcoholics build up a tolerance, it's called.  They build up a tolerance and then it takes more to get drunk.  But other people, I was saying before, other people's hangovers react differently.  Some people can be fine.  They need a cup of coffee and then they're like, oh, the thing I need is a nice egg sandwich 
[03:16:30]  or something.  If I think about food for 24 hours during the time I'm hungover, I will throw up.  I can't look at a food commercial.  What's this thing you take now?  I've seen it.  You take it before so you don't get hangovers.  I don't know if that works.  I don't know if anything has worked.  The best thing you can do is eat a lot before you drink and then eat like after you drink.  I was talking about Atlantic City.  I go, I'm drinking, I get back to the room, I feel hungry, I get some spaghetti and then 
[03:17:00]  a fruit plate.  So I eat all the spaghetti and then I'm eating the fruit plate.  The next thing I remember is waking up, it's the morning, my head is pounding and I have  pineapple and cantaloupe all over my face and my chest and I just fell asleep in my food.  You could have been fucking dead.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so.  I guess you could have died.  Eating my fruit platter.  What happened that day?  What happened?  That's another story, Patrice. 
[03:17:30]  Oh no, that was just fucking...  That's old.  That's old.  That's a month ago.  That's a month ago.  Okay, all right.  That's a month or so.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And so the payoff, and I understand this a little bit because, look, if I eat the brownies  I want to eat, I piss all night.  I get up and go to the bathroom 75 times, my goddamn pancreas is going in shock, but you  go, was this worth these fucking donuts?  And sometimes you go, ah, yeah, I felt like killing myself, but you just kind of do it. 
[03:18:00]  I don't know what the fuck it is, but it's worth that shitty feeling you had, getting up,  dying.  It's, yeah.  And if you did it Saturday, you would be in fucking trouble now.  Yeah, I'd feel like shit right now if I did it on a Saturday.  Wow.  That's why it was Friday and I knew.  I've gone out on Saturday nights.  It's been, you know, fine.  The worst was going out on a weeknight when I decided that that was going to be a good  idea.  I slept the entire day. 
[03:18:30]  I just, I mean, I planned this.  It was like, all right, it's a weeknight, but I could do this.  And I went out and came in here fucking hung over like a motherfucker.  Still drunk.  And then, yeah, at the beginning of the show, you know, as drunk as you are, it's four in  the morning when you've been drinking until two.  Oh, have you ever noticeably said, this son of a bitch is drunk?  That day.  Or, like, at the show, has he ever been drunk at the show?  Like, where you went, this motherfucker is drunk.  No comment. 
[03:19:00]  There was that day.  Really?  There was that day.  Have you ever been drunk on the show?  Wait a minute.  The old show?  Any W shows when we were doing afternoons?  I was constantly drinking.  Constantly drinking beer for the entire time.  Let's say hi to Fat Opie.  There was constantly a beer behind my monitor that I would look at.  We got Fat Opie, Patrick, on the line.  Patrick, what's up, buddy?  I'm all right.  How are you?  Good.  Very good. 
[03:19:30]  It was a wild night, wasn't it?  Yes, it certainly was.  Art of the topless.  Patrick's band.  I heard they were great.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  I had a blast right up until, you know, I blasted JÃ¤germeister out of my mouth and nose.  Foot called me last night, and he said, I knew Ant was hammered when I saw him dancing.  When was I dancing?  Apparently, Foot caught you dancing, and he knew you would never let your guard down that 
[03:20:00]  much in public.  You were hammered.  I couldn't have been.  And then after everything was over, I'm walking through, and I kind of have to sidestep as  I'm walking, because there's some guy sitting in a chair in the middle of the floor.  I turn around to look to see who it is, and it's you.  At least I was in a chair.  Thank God.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You were back by that boot and that alcove, you know?  I'm just making a positive, you know, out of all the negative.  Dawn sat down next to you, Foot went over, and I went off to deal with the manager, and 
[03:20:30]  then next day, I knew I was talking to Foot outside the men's room door.  Yeah.  I didn't feel good.  I think I had a stomach virus.  How'd you get back to your hotel?  Uh, cab.  So you know you was on?  I think.  No.  I have no idea.  Wow.  Dawn and I drove you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I have no idea.  Wait, you don't know how you got...  Come on.  Why would I know?  I was fucking throwing up in the basement. 
[03:21:00]  Wait.  I know, right?  That I don't understand.  Like, I've been pretty fucked up.  It's called a blackout.  But you really don't know how you got back to the hotel?  Seriously?  No, I was wondering if it was a cab or if someone had driven us.  See, I would always remember stuff like that.  Dawn and I got you guys all the way up to your room.  Yeah, yeah.  You said driven us?  Yeah.  You was with somebody who was with you?  Uh, with Melinda.  She was that gone too?  Oh, she was hammered.  Good God, oh, mother of Jesus. 
[03:21:30]  These two are like the new Sid and Nancy.  Enjoy the ride, Patrice.  I wanted to say something.  We're enjoying the ride.  I wanted to say something about something.  Every Monday we get...  Behavior I've never seen at the virus.  Mm-hmm.  I never said none of them.  I said, let me walk away before...  I don't want to be involved with this controversy.  Y'all were so drunk.  Melinda was so fucking drunk.  You were drunk.  I said, let me walk away because I don't want to end up a story that y'all didn't know about. 
[03:22:00]  It was so fucking crazy, man.  Melinda was nuts.  Mm-hmm.  And you were just nuts right next to her.  And I'm looking at you going, do you see what Melinda's doing?  In my mind.  And you're just like...  And she's just...  I said, let me get the fuck out of here.  Dude, enjoy the ride.  That's all, you know.  I'm like, holy shit. 
[03:22:30]  Come on.  They're the modern day Sid and Nancy.  They're fine.  Sid and Nancy died.  It's fun.  My God.  My goodness, man.  I'm having fun.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not telling you not to have fun.  I'm not no fucking cock blocker for fun.  What I don't understand, and it's not unusual.  You're not the first person to say this.  I don't understand the blackout.  I was definitely sleeping. 
[03:23:00]  I know there's things like, I said that last night or I did that.  Holy shit.  And then you start thinking, oh yeah, I did say that.  Oh my God, that was stupid.  No, I think I was sleeping for most of the trip because then I remember walking into the hotel.  I remember Patrick guiding Melinda.  I remember saying hi to the hotel guy.  Like at that point, I was totally conscious.  I just don't understand the people, and I'm not calling you out because I've heard it a million times that say,  I don't know how I got home last night.  I always knew how I got home. 
[03:23:30]  How do you not know how you got home?  You needed to drink more.  Yeah, but no, but all that, I'll go with that though.  Okay.  I have, I mean, I don't drink like I used to by any means, but I used to drink a lot and to the point where I would puke and stuff,  but still remember getting home.  So you're saying I would have to drink more to get into the blackout stage where I wouldn't remember getting home.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like I've drank to excess where I have to now puke, and I still remember like shit. 
[03:24:00]  But you're not the only one, so I'm trying to figure out what that's all about.  Yes, Sam.  Also, there's a level...  You've got to hit everybody differently, right?  Yeah, I guess that's all I'm really saying.  I mean, it's about to react with your body chemistry, I guess.  Yeah.  I think sometimes not puking might lead to a blackout too, because you're...  Because then you still have a lot of shit in you.  Well, who's in you?  Yeah.  But sometimes you're like, and you have the best of both worlds.  Yeah, sure.  I just, I know I was probably asleep in the car. 
[03:24:30]  No.  I was awake?  Jesus.  You're making salient points.  You were laughing every time Melinda said, slower, go slower, from the backseat.  Wait, didn't you guys only have to go like 10 miles?  Not many blocks at all, yeah.  Not even, right?  Yeah.  It was close.  And you went upstairs and just fell asleep.  That's it.  How do you recall the other parts before the blackout? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Usually, you sit there, and through your headache, you slowly, pieces of the night start coming  back to you.  Oh, my God.  Like a Quentin Tarantino movie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Starts from the end first and shit?  Yeah, and then you're like, you're like.  Just start piecing it together.  What was that?  Did I?  And then I remember talking to this person.  What was I saying?  Hope it wasn't stupid.  All right, now I remember. 
[03:25:30]  Okay, now that was, that was okay.  And then, and then there's this whole block of time, and you go, what was I doing then?  All right, I remember that.  Liquor, liquor makes you.  Now, personally.  I was drunk one time in my life in Australia.  Went to Australia for a month to do shows, and it was, the shows were bad, but the night  life was good.  So I had a, I just said, fuck it.  I became really debaucherous and drank.  So I was drinking, and I, liquor, and this is why, this is the reason I don't drink. 
[03:26:00]  A lot of people are asking, why don't you drink, by the way.  Because I drank one time, before I went on stage, and I was funny as a motherfucker.  Ooh.  When I started comedy.  I'm saying I was funny, and also this.  In Australia, there was this gorgeous girl there.  And I mean, my confidence level was at such a high.  I was on the dance floor talking to her, and I never forgot this.  I stuck my, I would never think to do this. 
[03:26:30]  It was so sexy to do it, and I didn't even, I could never repeat it.  I stuck my tongue at the corner of her mouth, and she just started sucking on it.  This girl was gorgeous.  I would have never thought to do that sober.  Wow, that is so funny to hear from somebody that drank once, because that's the kind of  thing you do when you're drinking.  I just don't need that, man.  Your inhibitions kind of fly out the window.  Yeah, man, I don't fucking need that shit.  And you'll, you'll like, you know. 
[03:27:00]  It made you feel like, then you have to drink to get to that kind of place.  And it's not going to always work.  I just remember, I said, fuck it.  The liquor was like, man, I just stuck my tongue right there.  She was just, I said, holy shit.  And then I got on stage later, and I was as funny as I could possibly be in terms of saying  anything, and I said, I can't, this is new, because I'd have to be a junkie. 
[03:27:30]  You'd have to just keep doing it.  I would have to be.  And that's the reason why you don't drink.  I'm diabetic, but that ain't even really the reason I don't drink.  You know, I just don't, the addiction to what liquor does to your personality, man, it makes  you, but that's how I, why I am how I am, because I say, all right, I'm going to try  to find that drunk place without drinking, you know, that euphoria that you're looking  for with booze, and I'm sure what all it's doing is making something that's already naturally  in you start to behave. 
[03:28:00]  So that's why I just, I try to be uninhibited without drinking, because that shit makes you  wonderful.  There's a great curve in drinking, like, it really goes up.  If it was in graph form, it would.  It would just go up, up, up, and then immediately drop off like a cliff to zero, and then you're  just a zilch drunk.  And you're sitting there not confident and all that shit, and then you just, you have  a couple of things, and it's just... 
[03:28:30]  That makes a good point, because then, and just to follow that, you try to get to the  top of the, as close to the top of the cliff as possible, and the problem we all make is  we go too far.  And then you're over the edge.  Bam, you're over the edge.  Once you're over the edge, there's no coming back.  Right.  Now, when, other than, okay, so you're getting drunk drunk, fuck, at what point, if you stopped,  you'll be like, I am perfect right now.  I am a perfect human being to where I'm not making anybody uncomfortable, I'm fun, I'm 
[03:29:00]  funny, I'm sexy, I'm everything I want to be that I can't be without drinking, but I'm  here right fucking now.  I would say...  How many shots of Jaeger does it get you there?  I would say it was probably about a half hour before I went on stage that I was at that  point.  Wait, if you stopped, you would have been like, wow, Anthony's just a great human being.  Wait, wait, wait.  But, Chase, here's the other problem.  Like, he might have been in the zone a half hour before he went on stage, but the problem 
[03:29:30]  is, and I'm just speaking in general, you still have alcohol in you that hasn't been processed  yet, so you actually have to, you actually have to stop way before you're feeling that  you're in the zone.  Well, that's absolutely what happens.  And then you're drunk right when you're drinking.  And then you ride it out, let all the other alcohol do its thing in your body, and then  get to the zone.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah, no.  Because that's what happened.  Because no matter what you're feeling...  Until it gets to the blood.  You got to wait until it gets to the fucking blood.  Yeah, no matter what you're feeling at that moment, it's going to get worse no matter what,  because the other alcohol in you hasn't been processed yet. 
[03:30:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  And that's the problem, because everyone's like, I think it can handle another drink or two.  But you also have to keep going, because then the tail end of it catches up to you.  Because you don't want to stop, because then if you start getting a hangover in the night  time, because there have been times you drink early, and you know you got to drive or something,  so you just stop drinking.  Go to club soda.  And then everyone else is having fun drinking.  It's midnight, and you're starting to go like, oh, I'm feeling hungover. 
[03:30:30]  The fuck?  You know?  Now you're out with a hangover.  Holy shit.  So you got to kind of keep the level going, just by nursing a beer or something, just to  keep it.  Oh, that is just insane etiquette.  That's why I had to stop.  I couldn't live, because I just couldn't live.  Liquor makes you amazing.  An amazing person.  It does.  It just makes you.  I think it makes you a better human being. 
[03:31:00]  Some people.  See, drunkness makes everybody fucked up, I think.  Being a drunk makes you ridiculous.  Being, having out the effects of alcohol makes you amazing.  You know what sucks, though?  Being completely sober around drunk people.  That fucking sucks.  Because then you're like, I don't get anything.  This isn't funny.  You people are annoying.  You're loud. 
[03:31:30]  You make me sick.  You make me sick.  Exactly.  But then if you just got to that point and then you had a couple of drinks, you'd be like,  everyone's so cool.  This is great.  We are the coolest people.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wow.  How it's legal, I don't fucking know.  And what's your drink of choice, Ovi?  Bikini Teenies.  No.  No?  Although Patrice and I were talking about this.  Yeah, I like the wimpy drinks.  They just taste better. 
[03:32:00]  If I'm a drink, I'm going to drink a bitch drink.  Kahlua and milk.  Unfortunately, they have awful names, but they taste good.  No, I'm more, my heavy drinking years were like in my 20s into like very early 30s.  I'm just like, I just drink a little wine, a few beers here and there.  Nothing.  Are you a wine and beer, girl?  Nothing too crazy, really.  I pretty much refuse to do shots at this point.  I mean, I'll do one occasionally, but in general, I say no to all shots.  Shots are crazy.  Never slam nothing. 
[03:32:30]  Shots are crazy.  Never in my life.  Tequila.  I got a massive scar on my hand from slamming shots down.  There was a thing when I was in college, you did a little vodka and a little like Sprite  or whatever in a double shot glass and you slam it real hard.  There's many names depending where you were brought up, but we call them, I forgot, fizzies  or something like that, but it's all bubbles.  If you do it right, you're slamming it and you're just drinking bubbles real fast.  And I shattered a glass.  I got a horrific scar on my hand from doing that. 
[03:33:00]  Really?  Glass went pretty much right through my hand.  Nice.  Another drinking related injury.  I think three drinks, you know, to loosen somebody's, just loosen them up.  Like, you know, I think, you know, you know, a chicken needs a couple of drinks just to  get all whatever they need to do.  Excuse juice.  You know what I mean?  I understand that.  It does give you a kind of invincibility kind of thing.  You just say, fuck it.  It does.  But that whole thing of drinking till you almost die is just strange to me.  It's because you pass a point where you cannot be reasonable anymore. 
[03:33:30]  You can't reason with yourself that I really need to...  Like, there's a point where you're saying, look, I'm feeling it right now.  If I stop, I'll be all right.  And if you keep going, that voice will just vanish.  Do you still...  You'll never...  No, no, no.  No pot.  No coke.  No.  No.  Did you ever?  Uh, yeah.  A little bit?  Back, you know.  You was a maniac, dude. 
[03:34:00]  Back.  No, I really wasn't a maniac.  Especially, like, pot.  I stopped smoking pot.  I'm putting it all together.  Oh, yeah.  Well...  Just all together, you know.  Pot I used to smoke, but I stopped smoking pot, like, right when I got out of high school.  I didn't...  I wasn't a big pothead.  And then in the 80s, a little bit of blow here and there, but usually it was because I was selling  it, me and Joe, my brother, so we just pulled...  Anthony Cumia is a piece of garbage.  We pulled a bunch out and put fucking baby laxative in.  You're like a mild-mannered citizen now. 
[03:34:30]  You're like underdog before, while he's shoeshine boy.  Anthony's shoeshine boy now, and he used to be underdog.  I can't believe you, man.  Oh, it was awful.  Coke dealer.  You was just a mess.  People banging on the door at four in the morning with a bicycle in their hand.  You're like a law-abiding citizen and shit.  Damn.  Patrick, anything else?  Pay my taxes.  No, I just...  I helped my landlady take out the garbage.  All right, I'm going to get back to work. 
[03:35:00]  Anthony, I'm glad you guys are feeling better today.  Thank you.  Today, it was Friday night, this party.  It happened.  Jesus.  I know.  It was an awful lot.  You know what?  I didn't drink a thing, and I'm just getting back to normal today.  Yeah.  See?  So, that's just the kind of night.  Safe to say this was one of the better parties.  Oh, it was a big blast.  Yeah.  It was certainly a biggie.  I got...  Oh, where were you?  Um...  He was being smart, staying away from that. 
[03:35:30]  No, I was...  I actually wanted to go, but then...  No big deal.  But then...  No, well, to be honest, Lindsay got her wisdom teeth out, and, you know, she wasn't feeling  up to it.  Then she should have been there with no wisdom teeth.  I should do it.  Yeah, no wisdom.  I had no wisdom.  So, we were...  Actually, we had all in...  We were gonna go, but then, you know, she wasn't feeling up to it.  I'm not trying to blame her, but...  Is she doing better now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's fine now.  I mean, but she got all four taken out, which is... 
[03:36:00]  That just...  So, that's...  You know...  I had Bob Kelly yelling at me, because I wasn't playing the game he wanted to play.  Like, I couldn't move my eyes right.  And I got Call of Duty 4, you know...  Where at?  At this party?  No, no, at home.  On Sunday.  I finally get home on Sunday.  Oh, you was playing them online?  I get home on Sunday, and I just flip on Pal Talk for a minute to, you know, see what  everyone's saying and stuff.  And I'm wearing the same clothes I wore here on Friday to broadcast it.  Holy shit. 
[03:36:30]  It was so mess.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So, yeah, and then I boot up Call of Duty 4 on my PC.  You like it?  It's fucking amazing.  It's the...  You don't...  You're not a video game guy, right?  It's just...  It's scary that that game is so good, man.  Dude, that part...  Wait, what makes it so good?  It's...  Okay, remember a long time ago, I was talking about...  It was Call of Duty 2.  Yeah, yeah.  The Call of Duty series is fantastic. 
[03:37:00]  It was...  But this is World War 2, but...  Call of Duty 2 is World War 2.  This is now...  This is called Modern Warfare, yeah.  Modern Warfare.  This is...  There's these two stories of the SAS British people working with the American people to  try to stop these nuclear weapons.  There's two dictators who get their hand on...  And it's all...  They're all Arabs.  All the bad guys are Arabs.  It's all in the Middle East.  It's just great shit.  They didn't buckle under.  It's fucking weird.  And if you...  The thing that's amazing about the game, if you shoot...  If you just try to hide and, like, be... 
[03:37:30]  You have a crew with you.  If you try to hide and just pick guys off, they'll just keep coming until you start moving...  You gotta advance.  ...to try to advance.  And the motherfuckers...  It's so real.  And they don't...  The AI, the artificial intelligence, they don't do the same thing.  Like, you can't plan on what they're gonna do, man.  They'll come get you.  Like, if you hide, they'll know you're hiding and they'll look and then they'll send dudes 
[03:38:00]  to come and kill you.  I got all outflanked last night.  Oh, man, dude.  I'm firing straight ahead at the objective.  And then I look to my side and there's, like, five guys running down the hill on the  side of me just shooting at me.  So they fucking flanked me.  It's gotta be one of the best games I've ever seen.  And one of the coolest looking parts is the helicopter.  Helicopter.  When you're in the gunship.  You're in the gunship and...  Are you talking about the one that looks like that shit you see on the news? 
[03:38:30]  It looks exactly like the fucking...  I never wanted to stop playing that shit.  Night vision shit that you see on the news where it's like...  Alright, you got one running.  Get him?  Alright.  Alright, you hit your target.  And you just see it like...  And you see a bright splash.  And then when you lay one of those big ones down and the whole friggin', like, five cars  blow up.  It is...  It's...  When I finished it, I was mad it was over.  I said, how is this over?  That part...  They could make a whole game like that.  Oh, my God.  What a game, dude. 
[03:39:00]  Don't shoot your own guys.  Alright, car on the road.  Fire on the car on the road.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  Boom!  It blows up.  It looks just like real footage.  Wow.  It's crazy.  And then I want to play online.  So, I learn a little single player, get the feel of it, get online, and of course, I'm  a noob, so I'm just getting fucking pwned up the ass, but it's a lot of fun.  I was getting some things I think I made corporal over the course of last night, but I'm texting  with Bob Kelly, and he's like, alright, get on this. 
[03:39:30]  He goes, what's your name?  We'll be friend...  I'll send you a friend request.  And I'm like, I don't know...  What are you talking about?  What screen should I be on?  And he goes, oh, hit the Xbox button, and I go, oh, dude, I'm on PC.  You motherfucking asshole!  You fucking don't tell me you're fucking on PC, you piece of shit fucking...  He keeps trying to get me to go online, and I'm like, I really enjoy doing these games  by myself.  Yeah.  I'm not a big with you.  I like going online.  I'm not a big fan. 
[03:40:00]  I like online.  I don't understand, though, a lot of times, and I'm new at this game, I get very good  at the games that I play for a while, but you run up, and I shoot at someone the same  time they're shooting at me, and I will always get killed.  It's like, wait a minute, or I can see someone first, and unload on them.  They turn around, pop, one shot, I'm gone.  I unload a clip at them.  You know, nothing.  Nothing.  Let's say hi to Gary in New York.  Gary.  Hey, how you doing, buddy?  Hey, Gary.  Hey, man.  So you liking the Call of Duty 4 today?  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[03:40:30]  You made corporal.  Yeah, I just, in fact, I just made my brigadier general two last night.  Do you play on PC or Mac?  Or on, uh...  PC.  Is that better than corporal?  Yeah, I just...  Oh, this is general.  This is why.  This is...  Bob Kelly's a general.  This is why.  A fucking general.  I don't need that.  I want to have fun playing the game.  I'm not really in the fucking army.  You know what's nice, though?  When you do something that goes, blah, blah, you made corporal, you're like, whoa, I'm getting  it.  And it unlocks certain things that you can use now.  Use better rifles, you get better camo. 
[03:41:00]  So if I suck, I'm a hostage, they'll have me just...  Pretty much, they'll cut your head off.  I'm in one of those bamboo underwater cages, like, it is fucking, it's just...  Michael!  Michael is rocked, Michael!  Good God!  One of it is, too, is you can run around and just pick up other people's weapons.  The P90 is the favorite of mine.  I love that gun.  You like that one?  Ah, a P90 with an ACOC scope?  Forget about it.  Yeah.  Good shit.  This is just something...  That game is really fucking cool.  It's an amazing game, man.  A lot of the noobs are using a grenade launcher, so they'll sit from a distance and blow you 
[03:41:30]  up.  Oh, you're constantly getting blown up.  That fucking sucks, too.  It's like, oh, I see there's a grenade in front of me.  Now I gotta try to run back.  I gotta unzoom my fucking sight.  I gotta jump and run because I was crouched.  Jesus, mister, don't understand anybody's plight.  Newbies.  You used to be a fucking newbie, too, mister, used to use the rocket launcher.  Jesus Christ!  Just because you found out how to use the tech three, it doesn't make you...  You know what I mean?  It's like...  You know what happened to me last night?  I run up these stairs into this room, and right at the fucking top of the stairs, there's 
[03:42:00]  two guys, they just fucking shoot the shit out of me.  Get a camp in there.  So I get back, and I run up the same stairway, and I lob fucking three grenades up there.  It blows up and says, you've killed your own team members.  And the time between me getting back there, my guys went up, killed the guys, and now they  were camping up there, and I fucking killed them because I threw grenades at them.  And they're calling you, you fucking asshole, you're killing your own guys.  I was like, wait, I just got killed from a douchebag that was in here. 
[03:42:30]  You gotta watch the servers you join, because if it says hardcore, hardcore servers, they...  Very little, uh...  Team killing.  ...shot you dead.  You can kill your own teammates.  But if you really want to earn a lot of points to get your ranks up quick, play headquarters.  Because headquarters...  Yeah, that's the one I noticed that you get a lot of experience points, headquarters.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've had thousand point rounds, left and right.  I'll be on there later on.  My name underneath Call of Duty 4 is Noodles.  Noodles?  I am Noodles.  I'm always Noodles in any military game I play. 
[03:43:00]  Battlefield, any of them, I'm always Noodles.  All right, well, I'm a member of Team ISIS, ICUS.  My name is Python, so...  Python!  Python, watch out for Python.  All right.  All right, sir, let's go to Frank of Long Island.  Frank?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  You have to play the C-130 pod.  It is the best.  It looks like actual footage from a C-130.  Yeah, that's the one we were talking about with the gunship, where you just light him up.  Yeah, and you blow the guy up, and then you hear the driver is like, ka-boom.  Yeah, he goes, ka-boom. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, that was a good one.  Good hit.  We got a runner.  And then you see the body actually flies and comes apart.  It's really creepy.  Oh, it's great.  That's fucked up.  Let's go to Thomas in Colorado.  Thomas?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I'd like to see you guys get Anthony a breathalyzer, and then we can have, what  did Anthony blow Monday?  He ain't going to get me on a Monday.  Jesus.  Come on, man.  We can guess and see what you scored.  Is it a .3, a .4?  I'd do a breathalyzer on a Monday, but it's...  Will you register on a Monday, though? 
[03:44:00]  How long does it take?  No, you blow it over the weekend.  I don't get drunk on a fucking Sunday.  No, I think he means, like, just do it over the weekend.  Over the weekend when I'm at my peak, and then make a game of it.  Blow in a breathalyzer and see what I blow?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I'm on a breathalyzer.  Great.  Great.  Give him more reasons to have a few beers.  Incentive.  I have an incentive to drink.  I could do better than that.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this?  Huh?  I said he's going to dare himself to do better.  Most of my weekends...  Yeah, absolutely.  Honestly, most of my weekends are spent in front of the computer. 
[03:44:30]  Being bored.  Yeah.  Let's go to Neil in New York.  When I go out, though...  He goes out.  Fucking go out.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, what's up, lads?  How are you?  Hey, good.  Uh, yeah, look, actually, one of the calls just mentioned, it was a C-130 Spectre, obviously.  Yeah.  But while I got you, hey, Anthony, check out, um, this book, if it interests you guys whatsoever.  It's called Lone Survivor.  Have you heard about it?  No.  Mm.  Go check out Lone Survivor.  It's about, uh, SEALs that get ambushed out in Afghanistan.  Four SEALs take on a couple hundred, uh, Taliban. 
[03:45:00]  And it's a true story.  It'll blow your mind.  Try and get this guy on, uh...  I heard about that, wait, yeah, because it was, one guy lived through it, uh, he was,  I, I saw an interview with that guy.  This will blow you away, this story.  Where the fuck did I read excerpts from it?  I read excerpts from it, and it was just horrible.  Unbelievable.  He was in the paper or something.  I just can't believe he lived through it.  Absolutely unbelievable.  Marcus Luttrell, uh, try and get this guy on if you can.  I mean, his story is amazing. 
[03:45:30]  See you, guys.  All right, thank you, sir.  It really is.  They got fucked, those guys.  All right, we're heading out of here.  What happened, Patrice?  Say goodbye.  We'll do line of the day, and you can go home.  Oh, I just had to go to the bathroom real quick.  We were going to break, but why don't we do line of the day, and we'll get out of here.  Oh, Sam and E-Rock have to, uh, book WWE.  The great Patrice O'Neal is going to be at, uh, Comics.  Oh, what are you doing to me here?  Take a piss.  He's got the diabetes.  All right, Patrice O'Neal this weekend is going to be at Uncle Vinny's Comedy Club in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  732-899-3900. 
[03:46:00]  And then he's going to be at Comics at the end of the month.  Go to C-O-M-I-X on, uh, on, on the internet to find out, uh, Patrice's, uh, Comics dates.  If you have to urinate a lot, it might be the diabetes.  The diabetes.  Diabetes.  We got Sam in studio.  Anyway.  Get my testing supplies from Liberty.  Hey.  How's it going?  How you doing?  I guess you're promoting.  Young fella.  Your afro's looking good, by the way.  It really is.  Thank you.  Are we, uh, winning afro wars?  By far.  Yes.  Eastside Dave is trying to compete against me, and he's got nothing. 
[03:46:30]  Dave looks like he got a haircut.  Yeah.  It doesn't even, it's not even fucking registering on the afro scale.  It looks like he's ready for church.  Yeah.  Sam's afro's starting to take, uh, flight.  Yeah.  Everybody's noticing it now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a, it's nice.  It's looking good.  A lot of people at the baby fuck party were pretty impressed by it.  Of course they were.  Yeah.  Were they touching it a lot?  A lot of people touching it?  Yeah.  That's the thing about it.  Yeah.  You don't like that at all.  It's starting to look like a football helmet, kind of thing.  Oh, thank you.  A little bit.  You're getting there.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, what, what are we promoting? 
[03:47:00]  WWE?  Well, yeah, we were supposed to, E-Rock and me both were supposed to promote it, but, uh,  yeah, WWE is sending E-Rock and me to the, uh, Raw 15th anniversary show that's tonight.  Yeah.  We're going to be in the-  It's going to be live on TV tonight?  Yeah, it's live.  It's on, uh, 8 o'clock on USA.  Let me tell you something.  I, I haven't watched wrestling as much as I used to.  Yeah.  I will definitely be watching.  Got to tune in for this one.  Yeah, the commercials sound great.  I mean, they're bringing everybody back, right?  Hulk Hogan's coming back.  Stone Cold's coming back.  Hulk Hogan.  Well, E-Rock cares about Hulk Hogan.  It's his hero.  Gives a shit about Hulk Hogan.  Everybody.  He's immortal. 
[03:47:30]  Stone Cold, Mick Foley, everybody's going to be there.  I want to see some of the other guys, but yeah.  But yeah, they're sending us, uh, they sent us front row tickets, E-Rock and me, and  today E-Rock decides that because the drive is long, he can't go.  Eric.  It's his friggin' hero.  But it's Bridgeport, right?  It's Bridgeport, right?  It's Bridgeport, Connecticut.  E-Rock loves his wrestling.  It's, it's Vince McMahon and Hulk Hogan.  Do you ever think about wrestling to be half nigger boy?  What?  What do you think of his afro?  It's despicable.  It's just nasty. 
[03:48:00]  Is that?  It bothers me.  All right.  E-Rock, why aren't you going to the wrestling tonight?  It's an hour and a half drive each way.  It's two of your heroes.  So?  Vince McMahon and Hulk Hogan will both be there.  Why don't you want to hang out with Sam?  He's not nice.  I have no problem hanging out with Sam.  It's just, I don't want to come home after 1 a.m.  We love wrestling.  I know.  I think it was because.  You're a fag.  And then go to work and just sleep on the couch.  At least we'll know you'll be on time.  You're a disappointment.  Last time I ratted him out for going to the snack stand.  Are you going by yourself?  I don't know.  I'm saying if you, I'm saying if you have to, you'll go by yourself, right? 
[03:48:30]  If I have to, of course I'll go by myself.  Sam loves wrestling.  I would love to go with you, but Sam, I'm not hanging out with you.  Why?  We could be on TV together.  Plus, you're just, you're too far down on the cool meter.  Like, you refuse to even.  And when I say cool, I don't mean your status.  It's just, you just won't be cool.  And you're happy with it.  I don't fucking fuck.  People who aren't cool and just, and are like, I don't care.  Can't fuck with them.  There has to be a sad warfare about you for me to just like hang.  It's not cool about me. 
[03:49:00]  Meaning, do you know, it's like you don't have to dress a certain way.  It's just that you're just like a, you just, you know, you got a wandering eye.  Like, your eye's funny.  What the fuck are you talking about?  If you look at Sam's eyes, his left eye is the Knight Rider.  He does the Knight Rider thing.  What are you talking about?  You know, like Knight Rider's thing.  Yeah, Kit's grill, kind of.  If you look at him long enough, his left eye starts to move.  His eyes move by themselves like an albino's eyes. 
[03:49:30]  It bugs you.  Like a horny toad.  And he doesn't care.  He's too comfortable.  Like that awful hair.  He's just too comfortable with that hair.  And they pan the front of the audience.  I just can't.  You can't be seen with him.  I think I've seen Patrice with some weird little Negro sick boy.  Like some sick Negro albino boy.  You're going to think it's such a huge show with a couple of lucky guys to be there in the front row.  You want, Sam, you want Flea Man to go with you?  No.  Why not?  Flea Man? 
[03:50:00]  Why not?  There you go.  I'll go with Sam.  Flea Man is the fucking him of my story.  I was going to, uh, you beat me to it.  Flea Man, what's up?  If there was an extra ticket, I would, uh, sure appreciate, uh, going.  I, what do you want?  I haven't even said anything.  I haven't even said anything.  Anything.  No, Sam, if you want me to go tonight with you, I'll go.  But I don't want you to go.  Oh.  That had to hurt.  Why not, Sam?  Why don't you want Flea Man again?  Flea Man me leave Pal Talk last night, too.  He got me so pissed off. 
[03:50:30]  Express it.  That's what I'm saying.  On the cool scale, Flea Man is so far below me that the last thing I wanted to be seen on TV next to some...  Hanging out with Flea Man.  Flea Man.  Don't you understand you're all sitting in the same room that, uh, they put all those kids in an animal house?  It's just a bunch of Flea Man.  It's just a bunch of Sams and Flea Man there.  They sat, they sat Flounder and, uh, the other guy with the, uh, the Indian kid and...  Oh, shit.  It's just a bunch of Sams and Flea Man all over the goddamn stadium.  It's just Flea Man, not Sams. 
[03:51:00]  There's one Sam, and he'll be in the front row.  I'm sure there's some other boys with weird hair that no one understands.  And you know Sam's gonna have a sign, and he has his own belt.  He does have his belt.  He has a fucking number one foam finger.  He just makes me sick already.  Hey, you uncool motherfucker.  I'll be trying to sit in that bitch trying to be cool.  He'll be like, Stone Cold number one with a fucking foam finger.  We would have a great time if we went together.  And Jimmy Superfly's schnooker feet.  Did Flea really make out a 73-year-old grandma on Friday? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Is that really true?  This old lady, uh, was hammered.  Um, she was so hammered, at one point they were drawing on her.  And, uh, in the back hall by the mirror, um, they were, they were making out.  Yeah, we're drawing on her.  Yeah.  Actually, there's a little bit more drama.  She actually has a boyfriend who wants to kill me now.  Really?  What's he gonna do?  Fucking beat you with his arthritic wrist?  Yeah, how's the boyfriend?  85? 
[03:52:00]  I got no idea.  Is Copper Tunnel Syndrome, uh, is that contagious?  All right, thanks, Lee Man.  He's out.  He's gonna smother you with his hanging scrotum?  Larry, New York, what's up?  Hey, I was just wondering, if Sam's got an extra ticket, why does he bring AJ Poopy Shits to the Raw?  Ooh, good.  Yeah, you wanna bring AJ Poopy Shits?  No, I don't wanna bring AJ Poopy Shits.  What's wrong with AJ Poopy Shits?  He's embarrassing.  Oh.  I can't stand that guy.  I bet.  I would never bring that guy to a wrestling show.  I think Sam is upset that he's not upgraded to being cooler than these dudes that were, like, 
[03:52:30]  Flea Man or AJ Poopy Shits.  Do you understand, Sam?  I'm as far down as AJ Poopy Shits is.  All right, listen.  So what's the big plug?  We gotta go home.  Well, it's Raw tonight at 8 p.m., three hours on the USA Network.  Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, Eric Bischoff, Mick Foley, everybody's gonna be there.  Why, Bischoff was gone?  Yeah, Bischoff's been gone for a while.  Fired or?  He was off to you.  But they'll all be back.  They're doing a 15-man battle royal with all the old guys in it.  Oh, wow.  Patrice, you would have a great time. 
[03:53:00]  I can't go.  And where is this gonna be?  Where is this event?  It's in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  Oh, it's in Bridgeport.  I would be sitting there going, I wish I'd have stayed home and just...  Of course you would.  Is that a lady 73?  I think that might be...  No, it can't be.  Maybe over-exaggerating, but she was an older woman.  All right, let's get line of the day and get the hell out of here.  All right.

That was funny, Patrice.  Corner of comma and semicolon.  It's not even words.  The letters and numbers.  The streets are so artsy.  I love it.  Comma and semicolon streets.  That's it for today.  As I yawn.  Alright.  I am tired today.  Patrice.
