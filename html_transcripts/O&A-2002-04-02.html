<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a birthday shout-out to Buddy Epson.  The hosts then discussed cancelled show dates, prompting listener calls identifying the affected cities.  Producer Jay Moore called in with news that a planned massage sketch featuring Opie and Anthony would instead use actors, specifically the "gayest-looking writer" he could find, leading to much amusement and speculation.  Moore also detailed a dispute with ESPN executives over having Deacon Jones as a guest on his show.  Ol' Dirty Bastard (ODB) joined the call, engaging in humorous banter about the sketch and potential payment.

Next, the hosts mocked a prank by former colleague Bruce Mittman at a Boston radio station—a false announcement of Whitey Bulger's capture—which was deemed far inferior to their own past pranks.  This led to a lengthy comedic bit featuring increasingly absurd scenarios involving Mittman, the mob, and various outrageous stunts, punctuated by numerous listener calls adding to the chaotic humor.  The show then transitioned into a segment titled "Piss Off All the Radio Stations That Think They're Cool," where they played unreleased Korn tracks, resulting in an irate call from a record label representative issuing a cease-and-desist order—a reaction the hosts found highly entertaining, and continued playing the music.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about early internet streaming video and predictions (and mocking) of future technologies like flying cars and robots.  A caller, "Bobby," recounted a negative experience with a camera crew. The hosts then discussed illegal downloading of video games and CDs, engaging in humorous insults.  A Sony-related caller was dismissed as a "tool listener."  A birthday call to the 94-year-old Buddy Epson followed, featuring extensive reminiscing about his vaudeville and Hollywood career, including anecdotes and songs.  Pete Johnson, another vaudeville veteran, joined the call. The conversation returned to the Korn album and the resulting anger from other radio stations, including a one-sided broadcast of a phone call with MTV News. The hosts boasted about their wealth and dismissed potential lawsuits.  The segment included further calls, discussions of Jim Norton's personal issues (though specifics weren't detailed), a call from Portland, Oregon, and the search for Earl's replacement for a Boston trip.  The segment concluded with more calls, discussion of the Korn album, humorous insults, banter, a brief mention of Playboy magazine and reality TV stars, and a Wesley Willis song.

The show then segued into a rambling discussion punctuated by "Rock and Roll McDonald's" chants. A caller shared a story about meeting Biz Markie, who revealed his manager had stolen the band's money, leading them to sleep in an airport.  This sparked a discussion of a song about the situation, including listener suggestions and an improvised musical interlude. Numerous calls followed, covering Wesley Willis's music ("Vampire Bat," "Cut That Mullet"), Biz Markie's "Benny and the Jets" cover, a highly offensive and graphic discussion of the pornography magazine "Black Tail," a caller's account of losing a limb after falling asleep on train tracks, a graphic description of a sexual encounter with unexpected bodily fluid expulsion, and a hostile, vulgar argument between a host and a female caller.  Later, Jim Brewer and Sam Adams joined in studio, reminiscing about childhood fort-building, rock fights, dirt bomb wars, and other pranks, often using vulgar and offensive language. They attempted a bit to get guests to say "yeah" in a specific way. The show concluded with more off-topic chatter, calls, promotional announcements, and a brief appearance by the Iron Sheik.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Happy birthday, Buddy Epson.  Happy birthday there, Buddy.  A friend of the show, Anthony.  94 years young today.  We'll be talking to Buddy Epson sometime on the show. 
[00:00:30]  We should make it in the first hour just in case he drops, right?  Jesus.  Oh, make him wait until 5 o'clock.  Ah, he'll be around.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Yeah.  Anywhere else including...  Huh?  Vegas!  Oh, Vegas, Nevada.  Is Vegas one of the two stations dropping the Opie and Anthony show in the very near future?  Oh, oh, oh.  Am I throwing you a curveball, my friend, in Vegas? 
[00:01:00]  If you're in Vegas or anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  We've got to go right to the phones because Jay Moore is on the line.  Yes.  Breaking news from the Jay Moore camp.  Yes, Jay?  I just watched Rakim rehearse his rap song.  Yeah.  Everything's going well.  And I just wanted to let you guys know you're off the hook for the game of Seuss Pit.  Why is that?  Because it's going to be in the show tonight.  Get out of here!  It's such a...  I knew it was so funny, I had to go with my gut and have a guy play the masseuse. 
[00:01:30]  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  But you know what?  But that's just great news because now the world is our oyster of what we can do together.  Now, Jay, who'd you get to do it?  The gayest-looking writer I had.  Ha, ha, ha.  I got hit.  Wait a minute.  We tune in to more sports.  Right.  And we're going to see the massage bit, but without us.  Right.  That is pretty cool.  I'm glad to see you first.  I'm a company man.  That is all right.  That is really cool. 
[00:02:00]  I can't wait to see it now.  I'm going to be laughing my ass off.  I want to see who's going to play me.  Ha, ha, ha.  I've got to figure out who Barry was playing in that sketch.  Barry Cass is going for his Oscar.  Aw.  An Oscar.  That's classic.  Jay, we don't have a masseuse.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm so happy to accept this award.  It's breaking down so many doors.  Ha, ha, ha.  A Jew in show business.  Ha, ha, ha.  What are the odds?  That's...  I'm from Springfield, Massachusetts. 
[00:02:30]  That's an Indian word that means Jews live here.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's what he always says when he asks him where he's from.  Like, Springfield's an Indian word.  That's his line.  That's funny that you're going with the massage opener.  I can't wait.  It's just too funny to ignore.  I admit it was a funny idea, but we had a tough time being the masseuses, my friend.  Opie, you laughed until your wife screamed, what's wrong with you?  True.  Wife, girlfriend.  But now all the skies are blue because now the world's our oyster.  What the heck are we going to do together?  We can think of anything we want. 
[00:03:00]  Well, we'll come up with some more ideas and we'll...  We don't have to do it right now.  I just wanted to give you guys the tip that that was actually going to be on and it's just  retarded funny.  How many people that were listening to the show yesterday are you going to just lose  it when they see the opening tonight, man?  I know.  I can't wait now.  See?  I want to hear what some of the callers.  I want to hear what their ideas would be for the cold open.  You know, you're going to get...  We got to get old DB.  What's his...  Is he in jail or is he out?  I think he's around.  He's around.  Always around.  They can't catch him.  He's like Johnny... 
[00:03:30]  Johnny Lamb Jones.  No, B.  I won't be massaging you though, Jay.  No, B.  B.  To be on television?  Yo, I'll massage you, son.  Son.  Hey, Jay.  What's up?  When is my big sketch with Ozzy?  Ozzy pulled out on us.  Oh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  No way, man.  When you see the fodder we have in the cannon, it is over.  Cool.  It is total world domination.  Well, I'm excited, man.  It's going to be great.  Well, we're all looking forward to more sports tonight on ESPN at 10 o'clock. 
[00:04:00]  You want to hear something great, real fast?  Yeah, go ahead.  Mark Shapiro, the suit at ESPN that's in charge of everything, called me at 9 in the morning  and said the show will not go on the air if Deacon Jones is your guest.  Why is that?  Because he's a dick.  You don't like if Deacon Jones...  The show's been in production for six months.  Every time I watch unscripted with Chris Connolly, it's Kurt Warner, Marshall Falk, Ricky Williams.  Now all of a sudden it's like, oh, Deacon Jones, the all-time sack leader, can't have it. 
[00:04:30]  It's not going on the air.  We'll find you David Hasselhoff or we'll get you, you know...  What's the problem with Deacon Jones?  He doesn't think it's a big enough pull ratings-wise.  Ah.  And I said, do you really want to battle me on this?  Do you really want to battle me?  Do you really want to go to war here?  Oh, boy.  You can put any guest you want in the chair.  I'm still the guy asking the questions.  Hey, old D is checking in, by the way, Jay.  Oh, nice.  He's listening today.  Hold on a minute.  Yo, cause. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, uh, O.D.  Yo, what's the deal?  Ha, ha, ha.  O.D.B. just woke up to that.  You can't let the day sneak up on you, can you?  Oh, man, you got to wake up before 2 o'clock, my brother.  It's mandatory.  The spring.  Is it?  What happened?  Hey, O.D.B., if you were going to be on my show on ESPN, would you do a sketch where  you were massaging me?  Yeah.  Well, yo, what's the money look like, though, Garth?  See?  Now we're talking, Anthony.  I never know. 
[00:05:30]  He would go for it.  It ain't going to, yo.  It ain't going to be no homo thug type sketch, I hope.  No, no, no.  You'd just be massaging my size.  Just size?  Wait a minute, dude.  Wait a minute.  Chill.  O.D.B. turned into Jack Benny.  Chill.  Chill with that, man.  Exactly, right, O.D.?  I don't know, but before, man, you got to give me a couple of thousands, J-Moore.  I know you got that kind of pull, V.  First class airline, you got all the things coming to you in first class.  He wouldn't massage you. 
[00:06:00]  He wouldn't touch you, man.  He'd figure out some way to scam the money out of you and then leave.  Guess who I got on the show today.  What?  I got Rakim.  You like Rakim?  Who, Eric B?  No, just Rakim.  Oh, yeah, him and Eric B broke up, man.  Rakim, yeah, I saw him like Jenny Jones.  He looked kind of, I don't know, I don't think he was feeling the Jenny Jones show.  He did like a performance after the show was over.  You're telling me Rakim wasn't done with Jenny Jones?  That's shocking. 
[00:06:30]  He didn't look too comfortable up there.  But, yeah, man, he's a skilled rapper, man.  He got good lyrics, you know what I'm saying?  Skilled rapper.  Come on, let me tell you something.  He's doing an album right now with Dr. Dre.  What happened?  How do you know he's a skilled rapper, O.D.?  Dude, come on, man.  What makes him a skilled rapper?  We're talking, dude, my brother.  My brother, we're talking Peaks 96th Street, Rockaway, 1986, dog.  Where were you?  I was on the ballwalk, son, drinking 40s.  Rock and beating the skin?  Really, in 86? 
[00:07:00]  I believe I was in college getting an education.  I think you're drinking a 40 out of your bottle.  My man, my man, we went to different colleges, okay?  We went to different schools, you know what I'm saying?  You went to the school you can go to, and I went to the one that was given to me, so.  That was the ballwalk.  Oh, there you go.  Did you get to keep the tools?  I haven't.  The free set of tools.  Did you get to keep the tools?  Well, Apex Tech, my friend.  Apex Tech.  Thank God.  All right, we're going to let everyone go.  Yeah, enough of this love fest. 
[00:07:30]  Gentlemen, take care of yourselves.  Peace, baby.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let's say goodbye to O.D.  O.D., we'll talk to you later.  All right, my man.  O.D.  All right, peace.  Peace.  And Jay Moore, of course, tonight, more sports on ESPN at 10 o'clock with the gay masseuse open.  Oh, don't miss the beginning now.  That's going to be the kicker.  When we see the massage bit, I am going to be dying laughing.  You might want to get a little hippie lettuce in you to take all that in. 
[00:08:00]  Right on, bro.  All right.  I'm massaging you.  So, good.  We're going to work on something.  I'm going to get a writing staff working specifically for you, too.  Well, we appreciate that.  Do that.  I appreciate it.  This is going to be the best thing we ever did.  It's going to be awesome.  The three of us together, forget it.  Cool, man.  All right, Jay.  Have a good show tonight.  Have a great show.  And we'll talk to you soon, all right?  Definitely.  All right.  Jay Moore.  Here you go.  That's going to be funny to see now because it was supposed to be us.  So, now we can watch it in the context of, oh, my God, could you imagine if we had to 
[00:08:30]  do this part?  And I'm sure Jay is going to be like, oh.  The guy's massaging him.  He's just, oh, yeah.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I'm just psyched that you guys are still going down in here in Columbus, man.  Yes.  Well, the two cities haven't dropped us yet, my friend.  Yeah.  I was just like, damn it.  They better be on.  I'm going to be the first guy to bomb a radio station. 
[00:09:00]  A lot of people are trying to figure out what cities are dropping the O&A show in the  very near future.  Obviously, New York isn't.  No.  And, obviously, Chicago isn't.  Oh.  Chicago did the, you know, the next, they moved us up, Anthony.  Right.  We're now on 7-Eleven in Chicago, so thank you.  Much gooder time.  Yeah, we started yesterday.  Tim Sabian, who's the programmer down at WYSP in Philly, he's also running the Chicago station,  and he's waking them to F up in Chicago.  Wouldn't it be great if Tim was in charge of every station? 
[00:09:30]  And we'd just have carte blanche.  Yeah.  Be anywhere we want.  That would be nice.  Maybe they should drop Boston.  They don't deserve you.  No, Boston ain't dropping us either, obviously.  Oh, there you go.  All right, Joe.  Some clues coming in.  I know.  We've given out too much information.  Some clues.  Thank you.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Speaking of Boston, I guess something's going on in Boston today.  Yes.  We're getting a lot of email, a lot of phone calls.  John, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  First of all, that guy, Joe, from Columbus, he can go to hell. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Because you guys put us on the map.  Your buddy old Bruce Mittman there, a little April Fool's prank.  Yeah.  With Whitey Bulger.  Ah, yes.  Okay.  Wait.  I think I know what he's talking about.  They said, they announced that Whitey Bulger had been found.  Yeah.  And the families are all upset.  Nice try trying to top us.  I know.  Oh, you fell a little short, didn't you?  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  They compared it to you, and Mittman admitted that it didn't even come close to what you  guys did.  Yeah.  Well, we feel sorry for our old boss, Bruce Mittman.  He authorized it.  Yeah.  Thank you, John.  He didn't offer the right job.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for the info.  Later.  We do feel so good.  We feel very sorry for our old boss, Bruce Mittman.  Bruce Mittman, he was the general manager at WAAF in Boston, in Worcester.  Didn't understand what he had when he had it.  And when we got fired, Bruce spends his life now trying to build the next Opie and Anthony 
[00:11:00]  show.  So, boys, boys, why don't you go on the air and say, Whitey Bulger's been found.  For those of you that don't know, Whitey Bulger is some underworld guy.  You know what I mean?  He's part of the Boston underworld.  Yeah.  And he's been underground for about seven years.  He's been on the lam, as they say. 
[00:11:30]  FBI really wants to find this guy.  He's one of America's most wanted, and they're looking for him, and they have yet to find  him.  Well, I guess Bruce, he was like, boys, a good gag would be to say that Whitey has been  found, boys.  How desperate do you have to be?  Oh, my God.  They're going to have the mob showing up at their radio station.  Yeah, that's really smart.  That is such a smart move.  Where are my boys? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, what was that sound I heard outside the station?  Oh, well, they're dead, but look at the ratings.  Look at the ratings.  We're up two points, 12 plus.  That's okay.  I'm a genius.  As long as I don't get killed and the ratings go up.  Boys?  Hello, boys.  It seems to have worked.  Look at the...  Oh, two behind the head.  Hmm.  We should have said that the shwoogies were all going back to Africa. 
[00:12:30]  Boys, that's a good one for next year.  Write that down.  Write that down, b-b-b-boys.  I can't believe I let O.P. and Anthony go, and now I've got to find the next O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Look how they massacred my boys.  Boys.  I guess we made all the papers in Boston today.  Yeah, it seems that...  I guess we made all the news stations in Boston today.  Yep.  Seems whenever anyone tries to pull a wacky, wacky gag, our names always pop up in the stories. 
[00:13:00]  I guess Channel 7 News, they brought up you two as well, saying how it didn't top your  stunt.  B-b-b-boys.  You guys made the Boston Globe again in Boston.  You made the Boston Herald today in Boston.  Yeah.  What's your name on the second page?  It's everywhere, bro.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  I can't believe it.  They've shot my boys. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, the guy's like...  You don't want to screw around with them.  Put it that way.  It's probably stupid.  And, uh...  It's kind of like if you messed with John Gotti and his family here in New York.  Yeah, you don't want to do certain things, because the best you could hope for is that  you're just beaten to a pulp and left outside by your car, you know?  To lick your wounds for a while, mend your broken bones, and then move on.  I just think it's pretty pathetic. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, poor Bruce, man.  How desperate do you have to be, Bruce?  Poor Brucey.  I don't understand it.  I don't understand why they're not as successful as Opie and Anthony.  Why aren't they syndicated saying Brucey Mittman's name on a daily basis?  Boys.  Boys, there's someone here to see you.  Oh.  Hello.  I'm Bruce Mittman.  Who are you?  Ow.  Don't shoot me anywhere else. 
[00:14:30]  I'll accept the first shot.  He was always a lot of fun.  Keep trying.  But he's trying.  Keep trying.  That's trying.  Maybe someday.  That's trying.  Maybe someday.  Trying a little hard.  Now get your stepladder and climb up into your car and get out of there before they find you.  Drop the rope ladder down to my big SUV.  So I can get in.  I'm only three feet tall, yet I have to drive a huge vehicle. 
[00:15:00]  I'm surprised he doesn't have a Hummer, you know?  He's a little guy and he's got this big SUV.  My God, I looked in the rearview mirror.  I think I see some organized crime figures in my rearview.  What am I going to do?  Hello.  I'm Bruce Mittman.  Okay, I'll show you where the boys are.  Don't hurt.  Don't hurt me.  I'm Brucey.  Boys, I just want to start calling you Opie and Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  Maybe that'll help.  Maybe we'll confuse the market.  Can you change your names to Opie and Anthony?  That should help the ratings, boys.  I got a good idea.  We're so desperate.  Why don't you go on the air and say that we found Osama bin Laden?  Yeah, do that.  Announce, yes, we found Osama.  Let's announce that we found him in the Charles River, boys.  Floating down the Charles.  Tonight's local Boston reference.  B-b-b-boys.  We'll say that all the shwoogies have been removed from Dorchester and relocated to Southie. 
[00:16:00]  Your boys will be castrated, but my ratings will be enormous.  Through the roof.  And if anything, if we get into trouble, we'll break out the pies.  They can throw pies at your face, boys, like Dave Dickless.  Our ratings will be as high as I was at all the AF events.  That was always fun.  Because, boys, I want to be a teenager.  Look at me.  I'm smoking pot, and I'm watching Seven Dust. 
[00:16:30]  And I'm clapping my hands.  Boys, I'm in charge of a major rock station here in New England,  and maybe if I smoke the dope, I could fit in with the listeners.  God, is that funny.  B-b-b-boys.  I'll smoke my pot and be cool like the boys. 
[00:17:00]  And I'll talk about the hot chicks walking around our stage in an event.  Boys, I'm so desperate, I'm going to put your lives in danger.  All for the almighty dollar, boys.  Rob, what's up?  Nothing much.  I was watching the Channel 7 News this morning in Boston.  Yeah.  And, uh, Anthony, you're now Andy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You can't get that right, huh?  Opie and Andy. 
[00:17:30]  Now, how many people...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Well, that's going to be my new show.  I'm calling them Opie and Andy.  Hopefully people will...  Our next gag, we're going to send my boys through airport security with guns.  That ought to be fun, right, boys?  It should be.  Hey, Norton.  Hey, what is that soldier doing?  Oh, no, he's raked down my boys.  Boys, I know you don't have any talent, but you're going to be my sacrificial lamb.  I sure hope I can get a nice boost and a lot of press, like I did when Opie and Anthony said that the mayor was dead, boys. 
[00:18:00]  Pleasure for me to have the Opie and Anthony in show.  Pleasure for me, boys.  Ah, Colin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Norton.  Is Norton in the studio?  I'm right here.  Let's go.  Hey, Norton.  Our Brucie is a dumbass Brucie.  Oh, boy.  Colin, where are you calling from?  What? 
[00:18:30]  Where are you calling from?  Stanford, Connecticut.  I love it.  You have no clue who he is, but he gets it.  Brucie Midman.  All right.  Thank you.  I've been listening to you guys make fun of him for years now.  Yes.  Since you moved to New York.  We love the Bru's.  Bru's.  Bru's.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I now have to present a giant check to some shwoogies to make up for this event.  I can't believe it, but at least I'll get my picture in the paper.  Can you airbrush out the shwoogies in the background so I can display it at my house?  Thanks a lot, boys.  Now, because of the Whitey Bulger thing, I'm going to be beat in in a mob tonight. 
[00:19:00]  The Dagos are going to get me.  And the Irish.  Actually, it's an Irish mob, isn't it?  Oh, boys.  Please.  Don't hurt me.  I'm not even Italian.  I swear I'm German-Irish.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McFriend.  Wait a minute.  Please.  Don't hurt me.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mike.  I can't believe the mops after my voice. 
[00:19:30]  What am I going to do?  You can act like a man.  Oh, my face.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm just waiting to hear him say, uh, Magnum, you can't use the car.  Yo, this is Mike from Airborne Express calling.  Yo.  All right, Mike.  Where's my goddamn ski passes for Killington?  I went on vacation a week ago.  I'm still waiting.  Whoa.  Yeah, it's good.  Hang on, folks. 
[00:20:00]  Boys.  Did you hear there's a nuclear bomb ready to detonate in downtown Boston?  That's my gag.  Why are the police here?  They're arresting my b-b-b-boys.  I just wish my new boys had talent, but instead, I guess we're going to have to pull out some  of these.  We'll have to pull out some stunts.  April Fool pranks.  We're going to do some stunts, boys.  That'll get the ratings up.  B-b-b-b-boys.  There's a nuclear device ready to go off. 
[00:20:30]  That's great.  Infaniel Hall, boys.  Boys.  We're going to put my boys on an airplane and have them light their shoes.  Light your shoes, b-b-b-boys.  What's happening?  Why are they diverting the flight and arresting my b-b-b-boys?  He's trying so hard.  He loved...  I mean, we caught hell with the mayor thing.  Right.  And he got suspended for, what was it, a month? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And he loved every frigging minute of it.  Every minute of it, he loved.  Did you see the article in the paper today?  I was quoted as saying, b-b-b-boys.  I don't care as long as they spell Mittman right.  Bruce Mittman.  I'm the head of Muckety Muck in charge of my b-b-b-boys.  He loved it.  He loved the press of b-b-boys.  Now that you're in trouble, we're going to put you in stockade and have the mob throw pies at your face. 
[00:21:30]  Throw pies at you and pistol whip you.  They're going to take their guns out and pistol whip my b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b.  No comment.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, boys, we're going to have a meeting with the fagolas, and I have to give them a check,  b-b-b-boy.  The fagolas are coming in because they didn't like your comments, boys.  We're going to meet with the fagolas. 
[00:22:00]  Open entry, b-b-b-boys.  Where's my little ladder to get up on my car, b-b-boy?  I need a stepstool to get the rope ladder that takes me to the elevator that takes me  to my car seat.  B-b-b-boy.  And then I get into my little baby car seat, and because I'm so small, I have to disable  the airbags because they killed young, child-sized people like myself.  B-b-b-boy.  I have to disable the air-b-b-b-b-bag. 
[00:22:30]  It could take my little head off.  Let me stalk the mayor and then shake his hand and take a picture and make it look real fake.  B-b-b-boy.  Oh, my.  And you're not...  Oh, wow.  People get the story.  Mayor, hi.  Shake my hand and smile.  Click, click.  Okay, now I'll tell you who I am.  I'm Brucie Mittman.  Wait, Mike, hold on.  It's too good.  You've got to explain that for the other 17 cities.  Well, Brucie likes being a guy that's accepted in the Boston community, all the circles. 
[00:23:00]  And he was kind of shunned when we pulled the mayor thing and he got suspended.  He was put in the same goofball category we were.  And so he figured that he would hire a PR firm.  There was a PR firm that was hired.  Uh-huh.  That's why we had to go give out pies to the cancer kids, which we refused to do because  we didn't want to explain the kids.  Yeah, but the classic moment is you guys would tell me when you'd talk to them and they'd  try to cut the deals with these guys.  Either it was the gays you're giving a problem to or the shwoogies.  And then you'd sit down and talk to these people. 
[00:23:30]  And as soon as they'd leave, you'd be like, okay, Fagalas are gone, boys.  Go back to the radio show and do your thing.  Yeah, okay, Fagalas is gone.  We still have a meeting with the shwoogies tomorrow.  Exactly.  And then he gets a picture with the mayor and he fakes that old deal on a paper, right?  And that's what the whole thing came in?  Yeah, that's what I'm going to explain.  And so we hired the PR, they hired the PR firm and they have a photographer following  Brucey around.  He stalks the mayor of Boston. 
[00:24:00]  To get good shots of him.  So he was following him around probably all day from, you know, from appointment to appointment  or whatever.  And then finally he saw his opportunity, ran, got in front of the mayor and forced the  mayor to shake his hand as the photographer is shooting away.  Hello, mayor.  Hi.  And then the mayor finds out who he is and doesn't want anything to do with him.  But the photographer already got his shot of Bruce, you know, shaking the mayor's hand.  And then they threw it to all the papers. 
[00:24:30]  And I guess some of the papers printed the photo of Bruce shaking the hand of the mayor.  And Bruce's comments, of course, oh, we're good friends now.  I gave him the stink palm when I shook his hand.  Wasn't he up in New York?  Didn't you talk to him at one point, John?  He wanted to hire so big.  Oh, yeah, we had dinner with him.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  But he was on the radio, though, a couple of, what, a couple of months ago?  I have to go to a restaurant to have dinner with you, boys.  But can I get a b-b-b-booster seat, boys?  Because I can't reach my plate sitting on this little chair. 
[00:25:00]  All right, Michael.  All right, guys.  Boys.  But he's so desperate to find the next Opie and Anthony and it's falling short.  Because, see, the reality is when you pull all these crazy stunts, if you want to call  them stunts, you have to have talent in between them.  Yeah.  You can't just pull stunts every day, Brucey.  A little bit.  That never works.  But you've got to do good quality radio in between the stunts.  Right.  Jack, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  All right.  Hey, I'm getting a visual. 
[00:25:30]  Is this guy green?  Because he reminds me of the Great Kazoo.  The Great Kazoo.  Well, dum-dum.  That's a good visual.  Dum-dum.  He's as tall as Kazoo.  Yeah, so maybe a little shorter.  Boys, I'd let you drive my SUV, but your legs are too long and I have blocks on my pedals.  I need the blocks.  Let's see our meetings for tomorrow. 
[00:26:00]  Okay.  Bitchy women and uppity negroes.  There I go.  Zipping in my SUV.  There we go, boys.  Well, dum-dums.  What did you say about Whitey B-B-B-B-B-Bolger?  I can't fix this, dum-dums.  B-B-B-B-Boy.  I'm here.  Did you call the Great Bruzy?  The Great Bruzu. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, well, we're making ourselves laugh today.  Why don't you say that you're spreading anthrax through the city, that you saw two men and it'll be my B-B-B-B-Boy.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  How you doing?  B-B-B-Boy.  Yes, Scott.  Have you seen ozone?  I need a good half ounce of the good hydro, boys.  Ozone would always get me the best marijuana. 
[00:27:00]  I could smoke it at the shows we used to throw.  Boys.  B-B-B-B-Norton.  We're doing our indoor beach party, and I'm wearing my thong bikini.  To be like one of the youngsters, boys.  Let's go to Shaheen.  Shaheen, what's up?  Boys?  Yeah.  You're running this b-b-bit into the ground?  Well, why should this b-b-b-b be any different than any other b-b-b-bit, boys?  You guys, you guys are all good. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you, Max.  Bye.  Yeah.  He was a character, I'll tell you.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, you guys have got to stop.  Everybody here is laughing way too hard.  There's no work getting done, and...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that me?  B-b-b-b-b-b.  All right.  Get back to work.  What the hell is he burping for?  That's disgusting.  Well, yeah, that's what he's doing now. 
[00:28:00]  He's trying to make people do these stunts now.  I think he's going to pull us out of the gutter.  Boys, it worked for Opie and Anthony.  Let's give it a try.  Who cares if your lives will be in danger for the next few years?  Okay, I'm out of here.  The shwuggies.  The shwuggies.  I had to meet with the shwuggies because of you boys. 
[00:28:30]  Thanks to you boys, I had to meet with the shwuggies and give them an 8-by-10-foot check.  I could have been at a nice meeting of radio insiders, but I had to meet with the shwuggies.  I had to present the shwuggies with a check because of your irresponsible b-b-b-broadcast.  You know what?  Remind me.  I got the picture.  You do?  Let's put it up on a website, man.  I got the picture and with some of my clipping.  It's classic.  Of our old boss, Bruce Mittman, giving a check to the shwuggies. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  The check is as big as that window behind you, Ant.  Oh, I know.  It's just giant.  Here I am presenting.  And what did WAF do for me in return?  They fired me and replaced me with some slit.  Some uppity slit.  I'm replaced with one of those monthly bleeders.  How could she do the job of a real man?  Well, half a man. 
[00:29:30]  A b-b-b-bleeder.  I take pleasure in the fact that the guy finally has to work.  I know.  Because when he was our boss, he was playing golf four days a week.  Always out on the links, boys.  Because if you remember with the shwuggies and the check, he's like, uh, buboys, I had  a tea time at two, but instead I'm going to deliver this huge check to the shwuggies.  My tea time was quickly turned into an end time.  I had to hang out with the shwuggies.  B-b-b-boy.  I love that guy. 
[00:30:00]  Caddy, where's my b-b-b-ball?  You'll get nothing like it, Spaulding.  Uh, Rocco, what's up?  Hey, dicks, you better shut up or I'm going to naked jello wrestle you.  Get ready, dopey and unfunny.  I'm coming up there.  Hey, Rocco.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Shut up, unfunny. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, Rocco, the ratings are looking real bad for you.  In Boston, yeah.  Oh, man.  Get a plane and a banner.  Hurry.  You're going to replace your sidekick?  Yeah.  Matty.  Dude, no, we're cool.  Dude, shut up.  Get the banner.  Stat.  All right, Rocco.  Thank you.  Well, later, dicks.  Any phony bits we can look forward to?  Oh, man.  Any, any. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, probably.  Anything like, uh, is Matty, uh, getting kicked out of his house and has to move in with Rocco?  Dude, get a pen, Matty.  Keep going, unfunny.  Yes, sir.  Hey, Rocco, you doing any, uh, show prep for your show today?  You know, look at the Opie and Anthony website.  Oh, man.  Foundry.  I couldn't get on.  I was getting hammered.  But I like the, uh, Norton Cribs.  I mean, I never saw the Norton Cribs bit.  Rocco, good move, uh, coming up with the blow me line. 
[00:31:30]  No one will notice that it's, uh...  The F.U. line.  The F.U. line.  In disguise.  And the lesbian, and the lesbian for a day thing is really kind of cool.  But when you take pictures of the hot chicks making out on a couch or something, could  you keep Matty out of the pictures?  Because no guy wants to see another guy in the pictures.  Well, I do.  I forgot about that, Rocco.  I run the show.  I do what I want.  Don't tell me how to do it on a plane.  I'm sorry, Rocco.  You know better.  I'm out.  So are you stealing any tickets from Dave's office? 
[00:32:00]  Now you may be blowing it.  All right.  Later, Dave.  Take it easy, man.  All right.  Yeah, we're giving him away all week at five.  I stole him.  He's so mad, but we're going to make a whole promo out of it.  B-b-b-boys.  God damn, that's funny.  Well, best of luck to you, Bruce.  Tim from Boston, because everyone in Boston knows who Whitey Bolger is and says,  Hey, boys.  Yeah, that's pretty funny. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, we have caught this guy who has murdered close to 20 people, pushed drugs, was a stone  psychopath, and basically held the neighborhood under his fist.  April Fool's.  Ha-ha.  That's just showing a little desperation.  Right.  B-b-b-boys.  Could you sneak these box cutters on an airplane?  Let's see how that goes.  Ooh, well, they sure are.  I believe that's brutality.  B-b-b-b-brutality.  But I am Rock Quarry. 
[00:33:00]  He's like every member of the Flintstones.  I'm outing.  Replaced with a bleeding slit.  How long does she have at that place?  Her and Dave tiptoe out that door.  Might as well leave together.  They just changed the format or something.  Turn off the lights on your way out, my friends.  There you go.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  So that's what's going on in Boston today. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  We made all the newspapers and the news stations.  Yeah.  They always remember the other thing.  All saying it didn't come close to what you and I did.  Nice try, though.  Oh, well.  Good try, Bruce.  Mm-hmm.  Good try.  With your new Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  I love snatch.  And bring on the whores.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You filthy criminals.  Where's Ben Anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper. 
[00:34:00]  Where's the caboose?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  P-O-D.  Boom.  They have Jesus on their side, Opie.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Ha-ha.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Do we have a phone call coming in from Bruce Mittman, our old boss?  Boys, boys.  I was listening to your little rant, boys. 
[00:34:30]  I'm sorry.  My phone's a little bad.  I think the batteries are dying on it.  B-b-b-boys.  I was listening to...  I mean, someone told me.  Because I would only listen to my own b-b-b-b-boys.  Wrong, Bruce.  We've had you on the air many times saying you were listening to us, so...  I'll never fess up to that, boys.  That's got to give your new Opie and Anthony confidence that you listen to us instead of your own shell.  Well, I have to come up with some ideas to pass on to my new b-b-b-boys. 
[00:35:00]  I want to clear something up.  A lot of people said I gave the shwoogies a very b-b-b-big check.  Yeah, it was like eight by ten feet, I think.  No, no.  It was a normal-sized check.  I'm just a little fidget.  I'm a little fidgety little midget man.  Midget man.  Mittman is actually Hebrew for midget man.  Midget-like man.  B-b-b-boys.  You know what I'm going to do for my boys? 
[00:35:30]  Get them b-b-b-b-licity?  Well, you're trying to get ratings there.  You sound a little desperate, Bruce, but what's your latest idea?  I'm going to send them to Jerusalem with big signs that say,  F the Jews on their b-b-b-b-b-backs.  I'm going to put fake explosives on their body and have them run toward restaurants.  But, Bruce, you're Jewish.  I don't care.  I'll take it.  One for the team, b-b-b-boys.  You've got to be willing to make some sacrifices.  What?  Don't be in that word, you idiot. 
[00:36:00]  I have to go now, b-b-b-b-boys.  All right, have a good round.  Before this bit gets driven even further into the ground and pops out the other side of the world.  B-b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-boys.  There you go, Bruce.  Yeah.  Hey, I got an idea, everyone.  Yeah.  Let's play one of our new favorite games on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's that?  It's a little game we like to call Piss Off All the Radio Stations That Think They're Cool. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, I love that game.  Do you remember the last time we played this?  Yes.  It's a lot of fun.  A lot of stations out there, they brag how they play the best music, the most music,  Like, blah, blah, blah.  They make believe they have world premieres of new songs.  Blah, blah, blah.  Right.  They're too hip for the room.  Remember we had the world premiere of Korn's latest single, Anthony?  Yes.  Made MTV, matter of fact.  Yeah.  And we don't have the mob chasing after us?  No. 
[00:37:00]  Well, who wants to hear more Korn?  What do you got?  I got the whole Korn album.  Where'd you get that?  I got it.  Ah.  Ah, you're sneaky.  And let me tell you guys something.  The station in your city that thinks they're cool.  Yes.  They don't have the balls to play more tracks with the new Korn CD.  There you go.  So guess what?  We do.  Should we shut off the fax machine, bu-bu-boy?  Oh, we already shut everything down. 
[00:37:30]  The lights are off.  I know that first one we played, like, kicked complete ass.  Well, we're going to try another track today.  Very cool.  Actually, we'll try a few tracks today.  Uh-oh.  Why not?  Okay.  Korn's got a new album coming out called Untouchables.  Yeah.  And we're going to play another song from it.  Want to hear Make It Go Away, Ant?  Okay.  So we can't stop doing the Brucey voice.  Time to piss off all the radio stations that think they're cool once again today. 
[00:38:00]  Here's Korn, another track off their latest CD, Untouchables.  It's not even in stores yet, Ant.  Let me hear this.  Radio stations aren't even allowed to play this yet.  I know.  We'll know that for sure, officially, in a couple of minutes.  Here's Make It Go Away.  In stores, April 18th.  Another world exclusive on the Opie and Anthony show.  Checking out another track from the Korn CD, Untouchables. 
[00:38:30]  Can't get it yet.  I like that.  I like the first one better.  The world premiere of Make It Go Away, another song from the latest Korn CD.  I like the first one better.  They're checking out Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of playing piss off all the radio stations out there that think they're cool.  I like that one, though.  I like that one better than the one we world premiered two weeks ago.  Nah.  I like that one better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like Never Gonna Stop.  Yeah.  That I like better.  Well, let's try another one.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:39:00]  Here to stay.  You just can't use Rob Zombie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's Rob Zombie.  Sorry about that.  You're right.  Here to stay.  All right.  Let's try Tear Me Down.  Right?  From the CD Untouchables.  Jesus Christ.  It's new stuff from Korn.  It's a world exclusive on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  He's not going to have any gold records left.  No, no.  Which gold record would you smash today, Anthony? 
[00:39:30]  The one from the Vaselines?  Does he smash good ones or like crappy ones?  You know, he probably smashes the crappier ones.  Yeah.  I think just anyone.  The nearest one.  The Butthole Surfers gold record?  Yeah.  He can't smash the STP gold record.  No.  Or the Godsmack gold record.  Mm-mm.  All right.  Well, we'll try another one here.  All right.  Korn, Tear Me Down on the O&A show.  Another world premiere on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:40:00]  Another track from Untouchables.  Korn, Anthony.  Tear Me Down.  I think it's getting a little crazy.  What do you mean?  I think it's getting a little crazy out there.  Why?  I don't know.  Ben's running in here just freaking out.  F all the record labels.  They've never done anything for us.  Well, a couple are looking cool.  What's going on, Ben?  I think it's getting cool.  Just the look of panicked people down the hall. 
[00:40:30]  It's very funny.  It's just like phones and all sorts of hands and just...  Korn, it's our bit.  Piss off all the radio stations that think they're cool.  They could have played this stuff.  They didn't have the balls to do it.  Look at Charlie's all mad at us.  Charlie.  Charlie.  What's wrong, Charlie?  Yo.  Hey, Charlie.  You guys are a bunch of effing scumbags.  What's the matter?  How would you like it if Korn was playing your crap before you released it?  I would love it.  That'd be fine.  You know the publicity we would get if Korn played our stuff?  That'd be... 
[00:41:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  What do you mean who cares?  It's going to be a big event.  You want another fight?  No, it isn't.  Charlie, you went that far to promote that?  You went that far to promote Korn.  No.  What?  You see what I turned the table and you don't like it?  I turned the table.  Why did you pick up the table and hit yourself in the head with it?  You didn't turn the table?  Turn the table.  You would just laugh and put down the other stations.  Then when I say candy, like, you went that far to go that far?  Of course I went that far.  Look how far you went.  You're pissing everybody off, you scumbag.  Sir, just don't use the expression turn the table. 
[00:41:30]  That's the problem.  Turn the table.  That's the problem we have.  Why did you have to call up and read everyone the riot act?  You're an ass.  All right, Charlie.  Turn the ball.  Charlie, you got us.  Together we make harmony.  Charlie, you got us.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Bobby.  Turn about is fair play.  Let's go to Bobby Pigrager.  Bobby!  Charlie stinks.  It ain't Bobby.  It's Jim, guys.  Hey, what's up?  Jim Bobby.  Listen, you guys got to learn, man.  You can't turn around and play these things when Sony's open.  Once they're closed, you know the cease and desist ain't going to come.  Yeah, but... 
[00:42:00]  But in you guys' defense, I got to give you this.  What?  Okay?  You should have made a believer in corn out of me.  I was never a huge corn fan, but the first song you played today, I sure don't like.  I think I'm going to have to go pick up some corn albums.  Yeah, that one's pretty good.  Yeah, I like it, you know.  Hey, guys, listen.  Hold on.  Good luck.  All right, thanks.  We've got to play another one before they shut us down here.  Want to hear another?  One more.  Want to hear another track, Anthony?  Yeah, which one? 
[00:42:30]  From Korn's CD that's not even out yet, Untouchables.  I think we're going to go with Rock and Roll McDonald's.  That's one that's on there?  I kind of know some of the tracks.  I don't recognize that one.  Or we can play Leaving This Place.  Uh-huh.  All right, let's play Leaving This Place.  Another World exclusive.  Right.  From Opie and Anthony.  Off Untouchables.  It's Korn leaving this place.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:43:00]  Doing something a little different today.  It's one of our new favorite bits.  Piss off all the radio stations that think they're cool.  This is great.  That would be the fourth Korn song that we've had the world premiere on, Anthony, off their CD, Untouchables.  That's Leaving This Place.  Oops.  Leaving This Place.  Look.  What?  I just handed this.  What? 
[00:43:30]  Before you read that, I just want to give permission to all the radio stations out there that think they're cool.  Now you guys can play more Korn.  Now that, once again, we showed you the way.  Oh, you'll hear Korn all over the radio now.  Yeah.  Well, this is a little fax.  Looks to be from Sony Music Entertainment.  Sony?  Sony.  Isn't that like a college?  Ah, Suna.  Ah, Suna.  Ah, Suna.  Ah, Suna.  Ah, Suna.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:44:00]  Well, to Jeremy Coleman.  Dear Mr. Coleman,  we are informed that your station has obtained  and has been playing an unauthorized copy of the new Korn album,  which has not been released except the track Here to Stay.  Why did they release Here to Stay?  Because we played it on the air and everybody else started playing it.  The sound recording, copyright, and exclusive exploitation and distribution right  in this recording are owned by Sona Music Entertainment. 
[00:44:30]  Ah, Sona.  Ah, Sona.  Your unauthorized possession or broadcast of this album  and or your participation in its unauthorized reproduction  infringes Sony's rights.  Your premature broadcast will interfere with the successful promotion of the album  and result in serious and irreparable injury to Korn and Sony.  We demand you immediately, and here's what it's called,  cease and desist from any further broadcast of the songs from the album  except Here to Stay, 
[00:45:00]  or you will be held accountable in law and equity  for the damage caused by your conduct.  Yours very truly,  Senior Counsel of the Sony Music Entertainment.  So there it is.  Now, Ann, see how quick that was?  How many songs?  We did three today.  Four all together.  Four all together.  Man, you know,  that's action.  Now, Ann, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Now, if we stop playing tracks from Untouchables, 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  the new Korn CD,  Yeah.  right now because we read that letter,  Right.  When will you be considered pussies?  Yeah.  Okay.  This is Korn from the CD Untouchables.  Let's see how far this goes.  Here's another track.  Because most people stop after they get it.  I just want to see what happens.  Thanks for dicking us over, dicks.  This is Falling Through Time,  another world exclusive from Korn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Falling Through Time, 
[00:46:00]  another track off Untouchables,  brand new Korn,  world premiere on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  And I guess that concludes today's  piss off all the radio stations  that think they're cool out there, Anthony.  That was fun.  That was a lot of fun today, huh?  Yeah.  They hate that.  They really do.  It really makes us feel good  when we can do something 
[00:46:30]  that just pisses people off  that we don't really care for.  It's a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.  We enjoy this segment immensely.  But the thing is, though,  it's like, isn't it weird?  You're not a rock station,  but you're premiering those songs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what's good about it.  Yeah, because that even adds  to the pissed off factor.  Yeah.  Because that's all the cool stations,  wink, wink, nudge, nudge, have.  Yeah.  And if we take that away from them,  then what do they really have?  But they can't say that they premiered it.  No.  Right.  Oh, they'll fake it 
[00:47:00]  like they did with the first one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By the way,  all the stations that think  they're cool out there,  you now have permission  to play more corn.  Because now they've got to play it.  They'll call up Sony and say,  hey, they played it.  You know, you're screwing us.  If you don't let us play it,  we're not going to play it  when it does come out.  Right.  And they go, okay,  we'll let you play it.  So now you guys are going to hear  new corn all over the radio,  and who do you have to thank?  Your pal's Opie and Anthony.  Bruce E. Mittman.  Oh, sorry.  I thought it was Bruce.  No?  Now back to your regular 
[00:47:30]  scheduled programming.  You can get...  Rainwreck Radio.  Like a bunch of people  cheering on a race.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Opie, scum,  Anthony, slime.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers  in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else  outside of New York,  you could use  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:48:00]  Sherwin.  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, Sherwin?  Let me tell you something.  Harvey Leeds  is going to come down there  personally  and kick the living crap  out of you two douchebags.  What the hell's the matter  with you people?  Why?  What is the matter  with you people  playing courts music  before the CD is released?  Oh, shut up.  Stupid dickheads!  That was cute.  Thanks, Sherwin.  Jen, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted  to thank you guys  for playing it  because of you two, 
[00:48:30]  I now downloaded  half the album already.  Never buy CDs.  Always download.  Thank you, guys.  All right, Jen.  Hope you enjoyed that.  You know what I was  watching a little of  on the computer  right in front of me  thanks to certain people here?  As Korn was playing,  I was watching  Blade 2.  Were you really?  Yeah, it's...  Man, you get anything  on the internet.  Any medium.  There's not a movie 
[00:49:00]  or an album  that is being worked on  at this minute  that isn't available  somehow, some way.  I bet you can get  the entire Star Wars movie.  I bet you can get  the next Lord of the Rings  because all that  is done already.  I bet you get  the next movie.  But if you could get  all the new releases  on the internet,  what are all the Ethiopians  going to do  on the streets of New York?  Right.  They're not going to be  able to sell their bootlegs.  They're going to be  out of business,  aren't they?  You can actually get them. 
[00:49:30]  I know someone  that downloads every movie  just as bad as  it's in the theater.  It is.  And there's a certain  site to go to.  Yeah, but let me ask you  something because I've  seen some of those.  Isn't it like someone  snuck a camera  into the theater?  No.  It's all shaky.  It all depends.  And you hear the people  you went to the movie with  laughing and talking  through the whole thing?  No, it all depends.  Some of them are like that,  but a lot of them...  Steve, why don't you  step up there?  Well, what?  A lot of them  are screeners copies  that they give to...  Especially around 
[00:50:00]  Academy Awards times,  there are screener DVDs  that go out to  Academy members  that get ripped  and thrown up  on the internet.  And you can tell  a lot of times  because there will be  a little cursor  that flashes in the corner  or there will be  a little scroll  along the bottom  that says property  of such and such pictures  do not reproduce,  blah, blah, blah.  And also,  a lot of movies  nowadays make their way  to the theaters  digitally.  They don't have to send  an actual hard reel  of the film anymore  to the theaters.  They download it  from a secure site,  ha-ha,  and it's all digital  and if you intercept it 
[00:50:30]  or if you have somebody  at the other end  that has access to it  at late hours  and can rip some  of this stuff  and put it up  on the internet,  that's what happens.  That's why Blade 2,  there it is,  it's in theaters,  it's a brand new  friggin' movie.  Hey, you can watch it  on the internet.  There's even stuff  that hasn't been released yet.  Right, yeah.  There's a new Friday  the 13th movie  going to be released  in April.  I've already seen  a finished screener copy  cut of the film.  Really?  Jason X?  Yeah, Jason X.  Jason from  In Outer Space?  Yes.  I saw the trailer  for that, 
[00:51:00]  I just thought  laughing my balls off.  It's pretty funny.  Jason X?  It was really funny.  Jason X.  Jason in Outer Space.  In Outer Space, yeah.  He gets mutated  to the point  where he's like  a Terminator.  He's got like  the all silver,  the mask and stuff,  isn't a hockey mask,  he's got the big  silver thing on it,  he's like robo-Jason.  I don't know  if you know,  I can't give out  the start name,  my friend actually went  and downloaded  Goodfellas.  Oh, did he?  All the hot films.  All the new movies.  All the latest releases.  I'm just so glad  you could go on the internet 
[00:51:30]  and get this stuff  because, man,  the consumers have been  getting ripped off  for so long.  You know what?  They really have.  There is a trade-off,  though, you know,  you want to pay the money  to see these movies  in the theater  because it's in a theater.  Sometimes you can't  put it on a computer monitor  and get the sound  and the visuals  that you get  in a movie theater.  In all fairness,  that blade, too,  it looks really great  on a movie screen  and it's a surround sound.  You don't really get  the same effect  watching it on a one-inch 
[00:52:00]  white.  But you know what it is,  though?  The lights are huge.  But what's cool about it  is that you can do that.  I know.  That's what it is.  At your office.  The cool thing is  that you can.  Even though you can  pay the money  and walk a block,  let's say,  here in Manhattan  and go see it  in a theater,  the fact that you can  get it on your computer  is what makes it cool.  Who cares?  You don't even care  if it's 10th generation.  That's what I'm into.  When we were bootlegging  concerts,  me and the Buzzman  up there in Rochester,  the Springsteen  and the Gabriel,  I mean,  we're going old school,  but that's when we did 
[00:52:30]  a little while ago.  It didn't matter  that the quality,  and I made fun of you,  I know.  I know.  The Aussie videos  that Martin got.  But it didn't matter  that the quality was bad  and it was 10th generation  and the camera work  was shaky.  It was just the fact  that you got away  with the bootlegging video  at a Bruce Springsteen show.  A lot of people  were amazed  when a streaming video  first came out  on the internet.  They still don't have it down  in a lot of aspects,  but when it first came out,  it just sucked.  But you're like,  dude, 
[00:53:00]  I'm watching CNN  on my computer.  It's like,  dude,  I'm watching it on TV  and it's full motion.  It moves  and it's not choppy.  Yeah,  but it's on the computer.  Right.  You know,  that was amazing.  They eventually won't even  have movie theaters anymore  or CDs will never be released.  It's all going to come  through the computer  and the plasma screen.  Within 10,  15 years,  movie theaters will cease to exist.  They won't need them anymore.  We'll all have surround sound.  We'll all have the widescreen TVs  on the wall.  We will all wear Mylar suits  and have robots  and flying cars 
[00:53:30]  in the future.  Stupid minds.  Your stupid,  stupid minds.  The spaceships.  We will all own  supercomputers  that will do the work for us.  Mine's named Rosie.  Okay,  Mr. Jetson.  Bobby.  Yo,  what's going on, guys?  What's up, son?  You guys are playing  the corn thongs?  Yeah.  I called camera  and they told me  to go F myself  and you too.  All right.  Oh,  they're a little pissed off.  That sounds like fun. 
[00:54:00]  I told them to play some corn.  They're going,  no,  we can't do it yet.  Under their skin, huh?  You've got to get a little mad.  Why do they have to say  that type of language?  Take care.  All right.  I think you said a-hole.  I don't know if they dumped out.  I've gotten,  we've gotten under their skin.  I've gotten video games,  a lot of those,  but most of the time  I can't really get them  illegally  before I could buy them anyway.  So I just,  you know,  and then you don't got them,  you don't have the manuals with it.  You have the cool box  to look at the cool pictures  before you play it. 
[00:54:30]  Shut up,  dickhead.  Tommy?  Shut your mouth.  What's up?  Shut your mouth,  you stupid dickhead.  Harvey Leeds  is going to kick your ass.  He's on.  What is that guy like  just going to  try to keep calling  or something?  And he doesn't even know  the guy.  He's just some  tool listener  that wants attention.  I think Harvey Leeds  and the gang at Sony  will be just fine.  Look at all the free promotion  you got.  Ooh, we're all pissed.  Ooh, but we're high-fiving 
[00:55:00]  each other in the back offices.  Yeah.  Someone had the balls  to do it, thank God.  You don't want to ruin  a little mom-and-pop operation  like Sony.  That's how that crap works.  Yeah.  They have to act tough  on the outside,  but in the back offices  they're opening up champagne  and high-fiving  and blah-blah-blah-blah  each other.  Ooh.  They get the free promotion.  They just got free promotion  for the new corn CD  in 18 effing cities.  What?  What?  What?  I see Buddy.  Oh, Buddy Epson.  We can't make him wait.  He might die on it.  Don't make Buddy wait.  Oh, Opie.  Buddy!  Buddy. 
[00:55:30]  Buddy Epson.  Buddy?  Hey, Buddy.  Hey.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Buddy Epson.  Uncle Jed.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  Buddy Epson.  That's very, very good there.  A couple of notes you missed there  so we'll be a rehearsal  at 10 o'clock in the morning.  A couple of clinkers there, Buddy,  but... 
[00:56:00]  I like the sentiment of it.  Yes, it's from the heart.  Where are you?  Where are you in New York?  We're in New York.  We're all over.  Buddy, we've talked to you  a few times.  Yeah.  I used to be...  I used to work in New York.  Of course, in those days...  352 West 87th Street.  Is it still there?  No.  I mean, $6 a week for a room there.  I believe it's still here, Buddy.  What intersection?  The intersection.  Which intersection there?  I used to eat at Yee Eat Shop.  I guess that's gone now.  For 50 cents, you could get a good meal. 
[00:56:30]  50 cents?  What year was that, Buddy Epson?  And if you wanted to...  If you wanted to whip cream  on your strawberries,  it was a nickel more.  A nickel more for whipped cream  on your strawberries.  I love the old stories.  It was the only nickel for car fare.  Hey, Buddy, where is this strip club?  What?  That's a...  A nickel for whipped cream.  This is New York.  I don't know what's there now,  but that's the way it used to be.  You used to probably...  I grabbed that with $36.10. 
[00:57:00]  That's it.  Well, you have a lot of desserts  and whipped cream with that money.  I worked...  I worked that...  If you had to work,  I got $75 a week.  $75 a week was some righteous bucks  though back then.  That was a lot of money in those days.  Hell yeah.  And what were you doing  to make that kind of money in New York?  You know,  I had to walk from the 86th Street  end of the subway  to my 352 West 87th Street 
[00:57:30]  and it was cold.  So I used to buy it for...  For two cents,  I'd buy a newspaper  and put it in my coat.  And it would be like insulation.  Wow.  For the first...  Until I caught pneumonia.  That's what the homeless people do now, Buddy.  They get the newspapers  and they stuff their clothes with it  to keep warm.  They buy the newspapers and what?  Exactly.  Yeah, they...  And they keep warm.  You know,  that story you just told me.  Hey, Buddy,  did they have horse and buggies back then? 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  Did they have what?  The horse and buggies  in the city back then.  Was it horse and buggy  or were they motor cars?  Oh,  they had motor cars, sure.  Oh, they did?  Sure.  You were old.  I never rode in any.  I didn't have the money  for the camp fair,  but they did have motor cars.  Were you acting in New York  or were you dancing?  No, I was hoofy.  Well, first of all,  I was jerking soda.  Who's soda?  For the 
[00:58:30]  Pennsylvania Drug Company  down at the  Long Island Concourse.  Oh, yeah?  Is that still there?  Oh.  The Long Island Concourse?  I don't think so, Buddy.  Well...  But you were a soda jerk.  Well,  that was the most fountain in the world  and I was the slowest  soda dispenser.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You were a soda jerk,  were you?  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  Well,  that's a nice word.  What, soda jerk?  Soda dispenser.  Oh, soda dispenser.  Well, a lot of guys...  Yeah, went from there  to the chorus of Whoopi. 
[00:59:00]  Did you ever hear of Whoopi  or Eddie Cantor Show?  The Eddie Cantor Show.  Whoopi?  Yeah.  I don't...  You guys were unborn yet  when I was...  What year was this, Buddy?  My grandfather was born.  I might have been still born.  19...  Oh, my God.  It's so long ago  I had to remember the number.  19...  26.  Oh, the 20s?  26, 27.  No, 28, 1928.  1928.  Wow.  Boy, New York  was a little different  back then, Buddy.  It was a little different now. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, just a little.  Yeah.  And then you went out to Hollywood.  Yeah.  Well, it was a long way.  I worked in Boulder  for things to do numbers like,  Hello, everybody.  How do you do?  We're going to entertain you  for a moment or two.  We're going to sing and dance  for you before you go.  Our act is peppy  and it isn't slow.  So, hello, hello, hello.  Hello, everybody.  Hello.

[01:16:30]  We don't want to be associated  MTV news  Ask him about the Carson wannabe  The younger version of Carson  They have now doing the news  Okay so what do you want to know man  Why did we do this  Because uh  We wanted to hear the new corn album  Because uh  The new corn CD is out on the internet  Anthony  Oh what does he say  Why did we want our listeners  To hear the new corn album  Well there's a couple of motives  That we had  Um  One that might not interest you  One that might not interest you  You is 
[01:17:00]  To piss off  Certain other  Rock stations  In New York City  Uh  And annoy them  And pay them back  For the fact that  Uh  They keep musical guests  Off of our show  By threatening them  Uh  That they would not allow them  To uh  To be on uh  Their station  If they appear on  The Opie and Anthony show  So we know by playing uh  A lot of the tracks  Off the new  Unavailable corn album  That it's going to piss uh 
[01:17:30]  Piss them off  Steve Kingston from K-Rock  Yeah but then  They  But then  Yeah we  We played  We played the single  And then uh  Here to stay  Yeah everybody just started  Kind of going  Crazy about it  And getting pissed off  That we played it  So they kind of gave  Permission to play that  So then the next step  Was then playing  Uh  More songs  Four today  Four today  Yeah  One two three  Four  What do we think 
[01:18:00]  Can happen to us  I don't know Opie  What do you think  Could happen to us  Is the question  Um Anthony  The answer would be  Um  We're so rich  It doesn't matter  Oh Opie says  We're so rich  It doesn't matter  What a pop is dick  No  We've been trying  To figure out  How to spend our money  Yeah we're trying  To figure out  How to spend our money  So we figure lawsuits  So a multi-million dollar  Lawsuit would be  A fun way to go  Yeah  The truth of the matter is  I think um  I think a lot of uh 
[01:18:30]  Record companies  They they tell you  To stop playing  They tell you  Don't play it  But the truth of the matter  Is they love it  It's publicity  For their album  What  18 cities got to  Got to hear  Tell them  18 cities  18 cities got to hear  A half hour commercial  For the new corn seed day  A half hour commercial  For the corn seed day  That's priceless  That's priceless  Mmhmm  Yeah we started playing what  About 3.30  Uh  Yeah whatever  Yeah about there  The songs  That we played  Make it go away 
[01:19:00]  Make it go away  Uh  Leaving this place  Leaving this place  I think that was the one  That we had to turn  The curses uh  Backwards  Well you gotta do that  Uh yes  Uh tear me down  Well we turn them  Backwards you know  You know  Instead of the S word  You gotta  What  Is it  Yeah it is  What  Yeah you can't say  The uh  The word for  Female breasts  Uh backwards  Cause it's the same thing  Ooh  Yeah  Uh what else Opie 
[01:19:30]  What other songs  Leaving this place  Leaving this place  Tear me down  Tear me down  And falling through time  Which was pretty damn cool  Falling through time  My favorite uh  Corn song that we played today  Was make it go away  Make it go away  Opie  Very strong song  It was his favorite  I kind of like  Almost as strong as  Here to stay  What was the second one we played  Uh leaving this place  Yeah leaving this place  Was really uh good  I like that one  Yeah  Huge  Yeah  Can't wait till they  Uh come around this summer  It's gonna be great  Uh I guess we won't be  Having them on our show  Yeah it's gonna be great  When  So we can listen to them 
[01:20:00]  On K-Rock  Because they will not  Uh allow them  To come over here  There will be a threat made  That if they appear  On our program  The record's gonna be  Dropped from New York  Yeah right  God damn midget  Can I make a TRL request  To you  Will it get through to Carson  No  Damn it  Damn it  Okay  After  What  You played the last  Song  Tear me away  Whatever he says  You read the 
[01:20:30]  Cease and desist letter  Then I heard  Something being torn up  Was that the  Cease and desist letter  Yes it was  Yes  It was uh  It's right in front of me  Still  But Anthony  Tatters  Anthony our statement  To MTV News  Our statement to MTV News  Oh he's making it  Um  If we stopped  After reading this  Letter from Sony  After reading this  Letter from Sony  We would be considered  Pussies  We would be considered  Pussies  And wimps  To our faithful listeners  Oh he already wrote that down 
[01:21:00]  Really  One step ahead of us  He heard that already  On the air  So at that point  Anthony  Here it is  If we stopped  Playing tracks from  Untouchables  The new corn seeding  Right now  Because we read that letter  Wouldn't we be considered  Pussies  And wimps  And then Anthony says  Okay  And then Anthony says  Aren't the Olsen twins hot  No  Ask him if there could be  An Olsen  Olsen twins thing  In the story  Yeah make sure  No matter what story you write  You write something horrific 
[01:21:30]  About me and the Olsen twins  Because it seems to be  In every single thing  That's ever written about us  Oh what happened with me  And the Olsen twins  Please  Restraining orders  It's an ugly  Ugly thing  Mr. MTV News guy  Can he hear me  No he cannot hear  But he might be able to hear you  Can you hear Opie  Mr. MTV News guy  Did you know that Anthony  Had a menage a trois  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  Yeah no that was not  With the Olsen twins  No matter what's been reported

[01:48:00]  McDonald's is a place to rock  It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat  It is a good place to listen to the music  People flock here to get down to the rock music  Rock and Roll McDonald's  Rock and Roll McDonald's  Rock and Roll McDonald's  Rock and Roll McDonald's

[01:49:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:50:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:50:30]  And a couple of guys in my band go, hey, Biz Markie.  And they're like, hey, what's up, man?  So what are you doing here? 
[01:51:00]  He goes, oh, man, we played a show.  And my manager took off with all the money.  Left us here broke.  We've been sleeping in the lobby.  Wow.  You got what I need.  It's Biz Markie.  Money F2 show up.  I was beat today.  Broke.  Start over.  I have a nice picture of myself and Biz Markie in the Detroit airport.  Do you?  Yes.  Was he sleeping there?  No?  No, I recognize you. 
[01:51:30]  My manager ran off with the money for the flight.  I was talking to the school of the U.S. nation.  I love this one.  The way that I met her was on tour of that concert.  She had long hair and a short miniskirt.  I just got on stage dripping foreign with sweat.  I was walking through the crowd.  And guess who I met?  I whispered in her ear and come to the picture booth  so I could ask you some questions to see if you're 100 proof.  I think he was influenced by Biz Markie.  Yeah, we're trying to get to the hook here.  You know how these things go forever. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's the goddamn chorus.  No, I don't.  I only have a friend.  A friend.  Come on.  I might be going for it.  This is what I'm going to sing.  Here we go.  You got what I need.  But you say he's just a friend.  And you say he's just a friend.  Oh, baby, you.  Come on. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, this is good.  But you say he's just a friend.  But you say he's just a friend.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  All right.  That's awesome.  Diabolical Biz Markie.  I have that CD.  Oh, look at you.  You ever hear his version of Benny and the Jets?  The Vapors is a good song.  No.  Benny and the Jets is hilarious.  Yeah.  Biz Markie?  I think he performed it on the Chris Rock show, if I'm not mistaken.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hi.  I got a suggestion for Rick's song.  Where are you calling from? 
[01:53:00]  I'm calling from a payphone on my way to the bus.  How much it cost you?  How long have you been on hold out of payphone?  I don't know.  I wasn't looking at the time.  How much money have you put in there already?  Nothing.  I called the toll-free number.  What toll-free number?  Oh, our toll-free number?  Yeah, but I have a suggestion for Rick's song.  And, Patty, what would that suggestion be?  I would make this a bit...  Just picturing your head right now, that chemo-headed retard standing at the phone and go, 
[01:53:30]  That was cut to the earth.  What happened?  It's a toll-free number.  And she'll call back and go, Ha-ha.  Very funny.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I checked out Wesley Willis about five years ago.  I got his album.  And he's from Chicago.  The guy's got great hits, like Vampire Bat.  And the guy's amazing.  Vampire Bat.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I haven't heard Vampire Bat.  Vampire Bat.  And you better watch out, or the insects will get you. 
[01:54:00]  Well, that's not him.  That wasn't him.  Right?  That's Wes...  No.  John, what's going on?  Did you guys hear that guy, Charlie, or whatever his name is, McDonald's guy?  He's got another song called Cut That Mullet.  Have you heard it?  No.  Cut That Mullet is him.  I heard it this weekend.  Yeah.  He just tells people, he's like, you look stupid.  Cut your mullet.  Show some respect for yourself.  What's that cap you have?  I want to hear Suck the Doorman's D.  Is that one?  I don't know.  I just know the mullet one.  All right.  As far as Norton goes, if he's talking about the Benny and the Jet song, he should just commit 
[01:54:30]  Mary Carey, because that song is horrible.  No, but...  I didn't mention it, sir.  I did.  Opie, the Biz Markie version is pretty hilarious, though.  Oh, really?  Oh, Opie, I forgot.  He can catch you.  I don't know what that was.  Keith, what's going on?  Keith!  Keith?  You, sir?  On the line?  Yo.  Who wants to say, Aunt don't like the black...  What?  What?  What's up with that?  What's your name?  My name is Q from Yonkers. 
[01:55:00]  Is it from Yonkers?  Yeah, Q from Yonkers.  Who's the girl on the issue of Black Tail this month?  What's your name, the singer?  Um...  You don't know.  She's really hot.  Her name is...  I forget.  I don't know her name.  Did you see her, though?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, she's hot.  What are you talking about?  Nah, you know why?  There's skanky black chicks in there.  They're not the nice ones.  Skanky chicks all over the place.  They're big, they're fat, they got the rolls all over, and their area is so battered and 
[01:55:30]  abused that it's all stretched.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's like they got hit by a shotgun.  They're a thing...  Yeah.  It looks like a shotgun blast.  So you don't like none of the Black Tail acts?  Put it this way.  I don't know what it does.  Hey, Q, put it this way.  Yes, I do.  They had a backdoor shot of one of the girls.  Oh, no, here we go.  I swear to God.  It looked like she had eaten about 15 packs of Hubba Bubba and was forcing it out right 
[01:56:00]  at the moment they snapped the picture.  There was stuff just piling up and pouring out, like internal stuff.  You don't like the big booty?  You don't like the Jennifer Lopez booty?  No.  I love it.  Believe me, there was no J-Lo's in that magazine.  Hey, Q, I dig the African princesses, and I hate that magazine.  Dude, I want that area to look like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  No. 
[01:56:30]  All right, Q.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Who's going to end?  Awful.  See you, man.  It's got to be.  Oh, Blue Can Trout.  Thank you, somebody.  It's got to be nice, right?  Like I said, like a cherry stone clam.  No.  It's got to be nice.  That can be nice.  I'm not knocking it, but.  Taught.  No.  You don't want things coming out.  You do.  No, you don't.  I do.  I like, I like, I'm not saying that cherry clam isn't lovely.  Believe me, I've spent good money for that, but I happen to like the other way, too. 
[01:57:00]  Good for you.  Yeah.  I don't like anything falling.  I don't want gravity being observed.  I don't want to know that there's gravity when you look at that area.  I like to look at it, and it looks like if you hit her in the stomach, it would just  start beatboxing.  That's what I like.  Is he hitting his wife, or is that a Dougie Fresh song?  Holy.  Incidentally, I got a great picture with Slick Rick.  Steve, what's going on?  You guys got to warn us before you play that stupid music. 
[01:57:30]  I'm stuck in traffic, and you should have seen the looks I got with my windows open.  You got to have a window roll-up alert.  That's a good idea, man.  We put you guys in some bad situations out there on the highways, and sometimes when  you have the window open in your office, and we're doing something really right.  That's a good idea, bro.  We've got an idea for Norton's jingle, too.  All right.  Our Norton is an angry Norton.  It's good, but we can do better.  We can do better.  All right.  Thank you, bro. 
[01:58:00]  I'm angry at times, sir, but it's just masking pain and insecurity.  All right.  Let's go to Earl, who lives in New Jersey.  Earl?  Yo, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Dude, I can be lazier than Earl, man.  Dude, I only have one leg, and I lost my hand, too, on the left side.  I can take my prosthesis off and sit around and do absolutely nothing.  All right.  The obvious question.  What happened to you?  Dude, well, I was from Philly originally, and we were drinking one night by the L, and  I fell onto the tracks, and I got hit. 
[01:58:30]  I'm sorry.  I mean, it's cool now, but, you know, I mean, I got my prosthesis, but I'm just as good  as I was before on this, so.  You got hit by a train.  You passed out on the tracks.  Yeah.  And got hit by a train.  By the L.  By the L.  Didn't you even see the train coming, sir?  Well.  He was asleep.  He must be a heavy sleeper, sir.  Not at all. 
[01:59:00]  So, wait a minute.  Were your hand, your arm, and your leg were over the rail?  My hand and my leg, I lost.  What were you on that you fell asleep?  I was tossing and turning last night on a $2,000 bed.  Well, you know, late night, all drinking, you know?  Partying all night.  You know, you get kind of wasted drinking that liquor.  So, what, are you walking home, you're walking home to, uh, you're walking down the train  tracks.  Well, I was walking next to them. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, well.  Okay.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  And I passed out.  You passed out.  Oh, man, what a bad place to pass out.  I was in a hospital.  That's an awful place to pass out.  So, you woke up.  Didn't you hear the train honking?  Well, man, I mean, it was in the, it's like in the middle of the, uh, middle of the track,  you know, there wasn't no intersection, and the only honk was the intersection.  Dude, watch out.  Dude, you woke up in the hospital.  Joe, Joe, Joe. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ow.  You know what, uh.  God love him.  God love him.  Give my condolences to the church.  You know what's amazing?  Oh, no.  Something like that happens to the guy.  You know, he remembers getting hammered at this bar, starting to walk home.  All of a sudden, yeah, how many times have you been hammered when you're walking home from 
[02:00:30]  a bar, right?  When you've been a kid, maybe, or something, whatever.  And then the next thing you know, you wake up, you're like, huh, what?  All right, I'm in the hospital.  My leg and my hands are missing.  Hmm.  Maybe I can fill in the blanks here.  Like, that's a lot of blanks.  Or hopefully someone else could fill in the blanks for him.  No, I've done some things, you know, in your early 20s, and you're doing the shots of  tequila, and you go home, you wake up, and you're on the bathroom floor or something.  You ever do that one?  You're like, what? 
[02:01:00]  All right, I have no clue how I ended up here.  Yeah, and who's this fellow behind me?  It's Jim Norton.  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy?  You have a fistful of hundreds, and you're crying.  Certain parts of you are a little stickier than others.  Here you hear.  Then he leaves.  Oh, my God.  But then you've got to sit and think, like, all right, I remember coming home.  I remember trying to...  I remember going to bed.  I sat down.  I watched TV.  No, nothing.  Just in the bathroom.  But if you wake up, and you're in a hospital, and your leg and arm are missing, oh, boy, 
[02:01:30]  that's a good night.  That's like, wow.  You know, I've got to make a couple of phone calls.  I've really got to backtrack a little.  Did you ever see that footage online?  It might be rotten.com.  I don't know what it is where the girl is running across the thing, and the train hits her.  Oh, yeah.  Classic.  I've seen that.  She's killed by that, right?  Oh, yes.  That really gives her a good hitting.  She went flying.  She's walking.  Not even looking.  Not even looking. 
[02:02:00]  There was a train in the way.  It was stopped at the track, and there was a track next to it, and the train was coming.  She just ran right past it.  Did you get...  But the weirdest part about that clip is, just when you get started, it ends, and you're  like, you know, you start whacking your bag again.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Go call Verizon.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You guys were talking about the mangled boxes before.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know what you're going to say.  I'm dying.  Yeah.  Try to keep it so we can get this on the air, man. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, God.  So, I was with this black girl, right?  And I was ripping her real good, okay?  All right.  Let me slow you down.  Okay.  Craig, we don't know what he's talking about.  I have no idea.  We have no idea what I'm talking about.  Uh-huh.  Ripping means nothing to me right now.  Nothing.  It could be a piece of paper.  Anyway, so I was ripping the S out of her, right?  Oh, sorry.  Her could be anything.  Paper, whatever.  Right.  Right.  Anyway, so I was going.  And just as I finished.  Yeah.  Finish what?  We don't know, Craig.  No idea.  Finish whatever.  He's ripping.  He finishes.  What does that mean? 
[02:03:00]  Finish ripping.  Right.  Just as I finished, she finished right after I did.  Right.  And on my power rod, can we say?  On the power attachment that you have.  Right.  The unit.  Out of her area came a solid, liquidy, red, black substance that looked like a placenta.  It was a placenta on the power rod, if we can say.  Was she pregnant, sir? 
[02:03:30]  No, she was not.  No, she was not.  It was the most disgusting.  It was sort of like a dark, bloody version of Twato on the power rod.  Right.  It was the most terrific experience I've ever had in my entire life.  Wow.  It was a once a month type of a thing that may happen to a person?  Yeah, I think it might have been something like that.  And I have no idea.  And when she looked down and saw that it was on the power rod, she was even more horrified  than I was.  Oh, my God.  And ran to the bathroom immediately.  Very nice.  So that's my little story.  Nice plot hat. 
[02:04:00]  A child.  All right, guys.  Later.  Bye.  Bye.  That's awful.  Yuck.  All right.  Uh, blah, blah, blah, then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's why.  Frenchie!  Yes!  Hi, how you doing?  Hey, how you guys been?  Two annoying bitches.  Hey, goose crap.  Retarded whore bag. 
[02:04:30]  Retarded whore bag.  You Canadian queer.  You annoying fat whore bag.  Are you from Canada?  I'm not from Canada, you twat.  Where's your home?  Do you have a home?  You down-seed-room twat whore.  Twat bitch.  You Canadian gay.  Shut up, you twat.  Why don't you go fall into a big vat of, uh, carousine?  When I saw you the first time, I looked at you and said, she has to be the dumbest poor in the world.  Go find a park you could crap in. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Shut the head up, you whore.  You sound like a retard.  You probably want to shut up.  The only thing you know is succeed, you whore bag.  You sound like you're queer.  You must have a chromosome left over in the toilet every time you go to the bathroom.  Why don't you cross the river so the alligators can get you?  Shut up, man.  Go find a park you could crap in.  Yeah, yeah.  Shut the head up.  You look like a down-seed-room bitch and you're married.  I don't know what kind of husband you have.  Why don't you goddamn die already?  Why don't you die first?  I'll die after.  Die.  Die. 
[02:05:30]  Get in the coffin and die.  It's the LTE of the Ode for me show.  Because I'll stay with the **** I want to say.  No one else can get away with the **** I'll get away with.  Nobody in the **** world can get away with the **** I'll get away with.  Wait a minute, Rick.  Now you're going to bleed me.  You ill-mannered sack of crap.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, they are edgy.  And we're back. 
[02:06:00]  With the O and A show.  Joey.  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Hey, I'm up in Rochester.  And it's 6-15, right?  Yeah.  Okay, go ahead with your story.  Hey, I'm going down the road and I'm coming up to both of these railroad tracks.  And I hear this train whistle, but the gates aren't down. 
[02:06:30]  So I lock the brakes up before I get to the track to see what's going on.  And the guy behind me locks up his brakes to stop for me, but the guy behind him doesn't.  Crashes into him.  And of course, I keep going because I didn't get hit.  And you heard the train whistle on our show, right?  On your bit there, yeah.  Huh.  Yeah, when that guy had no arm and no leg there.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  One problem with your story.  What's that?  We're not on in Rochester right now.  Yeah, but you're on in Buffalo and I hear you out of Buffalo at 92.9. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I got to listen to you live because the Rochester show.  Yeah.  It's like a best of show.  They put it on.  They play like 15 minute clips of it and then you get all commercials.  Yeah, they kind of mess with the show a little bit.  It really sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  I thought I had you with your cute little story.  I'm thinking, well, if he's listening in Rochester, we're not even on yet.  Right.  Yeah, but I'm in 615 right now.  I got you. 
[02:07:30]  BUF, very, very cool to us, by the way.  But I tell you what, man, the guy behind me looks pretty surprised when he got crashed into.  Yeah.  All right, Joey, thank you.  Hey.  Click.  Come on.  There it is.  Yeah, okay.  It took him a while to get that.  Will Rochester be one of the cities dropping the O&A show?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Huh.  Oh.  What?  Who said what to who?  What?  Far from me to plug. 
[02:08:00]  I don't believe in.  Malik, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  How y'all doing?  Hello?  That's cold.  Hi, Malik.  Yes, Malik.  Fellas, how you doing?  What's up, man?  All right.  Yo, I just called because I heard Norton, man.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  I think you're more black than some brothers I know looking at Blacktail, you know, all the  old school hip-hop artists.  I love old rap, man.  I love old rap.  And I love all box. 
[02:08:30]  I don't care what color it is.  Oh.  Definitely, yeah.  That's the only hip-hop to appreciate now because there's crap out now.  It ain't no good, you know?  I'm just older now.  Like, I liked, you know, Boogie Down Productions, all those things years ago, but now I'm older,  so maybe that's why it is.  You know, if I was 18 again, I'd probably still like the new stuff, too.  Definitely.  Oh, the chick on Blacktail, that's Blue Cantrell.  Those chicks in that magazine are awful.  I'm a brother, and I don't even look at them tricks.  It's disgusting.  They're awful, Norton. 
[02:09:00]  They're all so worn out.  I like them, though.  I like the pregnant videos.  I like them a little whacked out chicks, man.  You got to, I like them just a little dirty.  All right, fellas.  I got to split from about the burn.  Take it easy.  Oh, and watch that R. Kelly tape again.  I've never seen it, unfortunately.  Yeah, we haven't seen the R. Kelly tape.  No, no, no.  No, no.  I never saw it.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'd love to see it.  John, what's going on?  Yo, man.  How you doing?  All right.  All right, man.  Just wondering.  I mean, nothing much is going on today. 
[02:09:30]  Can we start up another Girls Get Naked, Put Their Pictures on the Internet contest?  It's funny you should say that.  We are going to start our WOW contest very soon.  Yes.  We're just waiting for a really good prize, and we should have an answer very soon.  Just like the Naughty Nighty contest, we're going to have girls wowing all over the country  at the radio stations we broadcast from, and we'll do the voting thing again.  So, coming soon.  All right, love and wow, man.  Long-time listener.  Hey, can I get a plug in?  I think we've got about two weeks before we start the contest.  We've got to see which stations are interested in doing this contest with us. 
[02:10:00]  Which ones are going to be around?  Oh, true.  Yeah, there's one that does.  Hopefully Sacramento will be around, Anthony.  Yes, yes, yes.  Will Sacramento be one of the stations dropping the O&A show in the near future?  Represented very well.  Yes, what do you need there, John?  Yeah, man.  Moda.  Best food in Philly.  Second in chestnut.  You're going to love it.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, thank you.  Little plug.  Does anyone else think Norton looks like Michael Chiklis from The Shield? 
[02:10:30]  Who is that?  The Commish.  I don't think he looks like the Commish.  Wait a minute.  I think I know who that was because one guy was telling me, oh, is that stupid Wes from  Philly?  No, this is Mike.  Stupid Mike.  But Wes, the guy who went on in front of me was telling me, I was like the Commish.  The Commish.  That's the mini Commish.  This could be the worst name for a show ever.  The Commish.  Hey, the Jim Norton show.  I have a feeling.  That's a good name.  I have a feeling Jim Brewer is going to be stopping by. 
[02:11:00]  I just have that weird feeling today.  I feel it in my blood.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Larry.  I want y'all to know that time is not an accurate representation of people from New  Orleans.  We understand that.  He's brighter than most of them.  Hey.  Wow.  Hey, I thought we lost y'all this weekend.  Time didn't flip the switch or something, and y'all were off.  94 was off the air for like six hours. 
[02:11:30]  Off the air.  Off the air, yo.  Hey, Norton, you suck.  I know.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Larry.  Bye, fella.  It's the Iron Sheik.  I just want to say hello.  This is the Iron Sheik World Wrestling Federation champion, Olympic champion, AAU champion, and  this is the number one radio station in the world.  To you people, very, very be happy to talk, to listen to the opium, and Anthony, one of  the greatest station in New York. 
[02:12:00]  I want to say again, God bless you all, my wrestling friends, and have a good day.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys that drive down there and bash  your heads in with a baseball bat.  Do it like this.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Executioner's with Linkin Park.  It's going down.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Sam Adams in the studio.  Sam Adams hanging out. 
[02:12:30]  Did you get a nice cold one?  I got a nice cold one.  Isn't that great?  You got a day off?  Yeah.  Good to be here.  Just hang out.  You don't have to be anywhere, right?  Hang out.  Yeah.  Don't have to worry about anything.  Good.  Anything.  Don't have to worry about dick.  Just hang.  Capital D.  This is like a treehouse.  You just come by and hang out.  Hang out.  We're not going to accomplish anything.  We got our...  Who's got the Playboys?  We got our stash of porno for the treehouse.  What is your Korean worries? 
[02:13:00]  Our little stash.  You know, the treehouse in the woods.  Absolutely.  This is great for Long Island, New York, anywhere around the country, I'm sure.  But if you're from New York...  We had a garage.  And you're from Long Island.  You had, yeah, tree forts.  A lot of people in the woods.  Some of the mole people made the little underground fort.  Ross Pertosi's house in the backyard.  Underground tree fort.  Really?  Come on.  Underground.  How deep?  I've heard of this.  At least five or six feet.  Come on.  Here's how you constructed it.  Underground with white wood. 
[02:13:30]  You dig it, and then you throw the wood in.  Huge holes.  Yeah.  And then, on top of the hole, you laid in two-by-fours, like roof rafters.  Yep.  And still below the surface.  Then you laid plywood on top of that.  Yep.  Then you buried the whole thing under the dirt and put some grass back on there.  Do you know that would lead to, like, the ultimate army game ever?  It did.  You know, we would have that.  Yeah.  It was a place to go for the rock fights.  The guys with the ground forts in the backyard had a definite advantage over the tree forts 
[02:14:00]  in the yard-to-yard Long Island rock fights.  You ever take hostages?  No.  Oh, little brothers and stuff.  You'd grab like the kid named Elmo.  Come here.  Let me get Elmo.  Leave him alone.  We're not going to hurt him, faggot.  We got you, little brother, dick.  I'm telling my mother.  Whatever, faggot.  We're not going to hurt him.  It would always start.  Tie him up.  You start crying.  Maybe a neighbor would be putting in an in-ground pool or something, so they had a big pile  of dirt in their yard with the dirt bombs. 
[02:14:30]  You know, the big dirt bombs.  Elmo could hit the bottom.  I don't know what.  I don't know.  Don't eat it.  Tommy, don't eat Elmo.  It would start as a dirt bomb fight.  And, you know, eventually you run out of dirt bombs.  And some son of a bitch goes, picks up a rock, wails it over the fence, they're not  even looking.  He goes, ah!  And it just turns into a melee.  Nice going, dick.  You ruined it.  Great.  We were all having fun.  Way to go, Jeff.  Dirt bombs.  Who threw the rock? 
[02:15:00]  I didn't know there was a rock in it.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  It was a dirt bomb with a rock in it.  I didn't know.  Right?  Fine.  Don't believe me.  Don't believe me.  No more horrific scene than looking through the slats and the fence, picking your targets,  and seeing the mom or, God forbid, dad of the house that you're throwing at,  running out the back door.  Run, dick.  Run.  Did you do the acorns?  Collect the acorns?  Yeah.  You get to the point where you throw anything that's on the ground. 
[02:15:30]  Dirt bombs are great because as a kid, when they hit something, they made that puff of  smoke and it was cool.  It was like a bomb.  And then you had the one crazy kid, we'd get, like, the cicada.  Oh, she's throwing.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Don't do that, dick!  That ain't funny!  You ran from the cicada, you little faggot!  Don't do that!  He goes and picks it up.  Don't pick it up!  Those damn things!  Come on! 
[02:16:00]  How are those the nastiest things?  It doesn't even bite.  You're such a pussy.  Dick.  You're such a pussy.  What are you doing, Tommy?  Isn't that funny, man?  He hated those things, though.  They're on the side of the trees.  Are you just walking around the side?  We go, is it dead?  You give it a kick.  Run!  Run!  It's coming for you!  Shut up, dude.  I heard they're like bats.  They get tangled in your hair. 
[02:16:30]  Classic.  We had a big tree fort out there in East Iceland, Long Island.  Me and my brother.  East Iceland, Long Island.  Why is that funny?  It's the mean streets of East Iceland.  No, because I just got the vision.  A cicada's like a bomb coming.  If you're, like, up in a tree, like, five feet up,  or they tell you, dude, check out this plant.  Oh, my God!  It's falling out the window.  Chevy broke his arm!  That's what happened.  This kid broke his friggin' leg, 
[02:17:00]  fell out of our tree fort, wrecked the whole thing.  So my father's like, tear it down.  You wrecked it, Dick.  We had the rock fights and the dirt bomb fights  from yard to yard with the various forts.  It's like a little battle going on  between the kids and the neighborhood.  No chicks?  No.  There was an occasional tomboy  that would kind of go around,  but you kept her out of the battles.  Well, we had, like, a playhouse  in the back of Phil's house. 
[02:17:30]  You had a playhouse for a school assistant.  Dude, those playhouse things, though, were faggot.  No, but listen.  Like, treehouse, cool, underground.  When you had, like, the thing with the windows  and the curtains and the dolls inside.  Faggot.  It's faggot unless you climb and sit on the roof, Dick.  All right, I'll give you that.  We used to show up.  I was such a dick.  And I was a fat kid, and I hang out on the roof,  and I'd go, Phil, put the chair, like, five feet out. 
[02:18:00]  And I would risk my fat life at, like, 15,  jump over the chair just so, like, one of the twins would be like,  oh, my God, he's cool.  Push it further.  I can do it.  You're going to get hurt, Jim.  Do it, faggot, before I punch you.  Before I punch you.  And the metal, for some reason,  the metal sheds in the back that you,  Pop kept his tools in,  was never cool to hang out in either.  No, because Mom could see.  There's too much stuff in there.  Too much, like, dad tools. 
[02:18:30]  It was dark and spiderwebs.  Yeah, spiderwebs and smell like gasoline.  So you needed your own spot.  And it was always a little creepy, too close space.  Yeah.  Space, dude, you're touching me.  But the frigging backyards,  because I know there's some of my friends,  they have the little sisters that had, like,  the prefab little house with the curtains.  They're like, dude, hang out in a clubhouse.  It's not a clubhouse.  It's an overgrown dollhouse faggot.  And I shan't be hanging out there.  Unless you're on the roof.  Go to the woods. 
[02:19:00]  I never went to the roof, but okay.  I never thought about a second story on it being cool.  J.R., what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Ruah.  Hammer.  Listen, I live in Brooklyn.  We dug the most dangerous forts possible.  We used to have them run electrically by car batteries.  That sounds dangerous.  God, why didn't we think that?  Listen, we dig a hole.  We have flashlights.  It looked like a crater hit the earth.  We cover it with guardrails and stolen car hoods.  You know, Long Island, you know something, J.R., you point up a great thing. 
[02:19:30]  The difference, it's the same, and it's the same final problem you needed to solve.  You wanted a fort underground.  Now, out on Long Island, we would go to the various track housing sites that they would  put up, steal the wood, steal the plywood, and whatever we could get, and make it out  of that.  Brooklyn over here is taking guardrails and car trunk lids and hoods.  Ruah, you've been to my neighborhood.  You're filming a crooked line down there.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  I remember.  I tell you, that's a potty town, and we took it underground.  All right, J.R.  Later.  Chris wants to add to this.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, listen, guys.  I grew up in Seacliff, and there was this really pristine golf course, and we built one  of these bunkers.  The only difference was we covered ours with leaves and all sorts of shit.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Sorry, guys.  Sorry, sorry.  Hey!  I don't...  He gets the whooping monkey.  I don't think this conversation requires vulgarity. 
[02:20:30]  So sorry.  My bad.  Try again.  My bad.  Nice language, dick.  I deserve that.  So we used to run up onto the green and grab the golf balls and then run down into this bunker  and disappear on the golfers.  Like the Viet Cong of the golf course.  We hide in Tunnel.  Go to Cambodia where they cannot furrow.  And we'd just disappear on them.  Hey, Brewer.  Yeah?  Oh, he got you.  Oh, Brewer.  That's a new gag that they're pulling on everybody, and you're new to it. 
[02:21:00]  Dude, I started that game, but you got to get...  Here's a bit.  You got to get the person to say what.  Right.  That's true.  You did say yeah in a question.  Yeah.  Oh, I have to say it in a question?  I heard that it was like a what in a yeah form.  That's so gay.  Dude, you're gay for even...  You're gay.  You're gay.  We're playing more games on our show, Brewer.  Mark, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I got brewers in here. 
[02:21:30]  Dude, are you listening?  I got you, Brewer.  He's so psyched right now.  The guy is psyched right now.  He's calling his hand.  He's calling all his friends.  He probably has it on tape.  Thornton.com.  Hit rewind.  Watch what he says.  Yeah, yeah.  Dick.  Listen how freaking stupid he sounds.  He's a rebar.  All he does is make noises.  I can do that.  Whoop, whoop.  What is that?  A monkey?  You know what's really funny?  Watch.  I'll rewind Brewer saying it and then ask him something different beforehand.  Watch.  Because he said yeah like such a dick.  Hey, Brewer, you a homo? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Dick.  Now I got him saying yeah on tape.  Mark, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  You got to touch your dicks.  It's going to be one of those days.  It's unbelievable.  You know, when I met you guys at Morton's, you were all nice and s***ing shaking my hand  saying thank you.  Hey, hey, hey.  The cursing howling monkeys have come out.  What are you doing, Mark?  Don't say the S word.  Crap.  I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  What do you want to say?  Brewer, did you have little tea parties in your playhouse on the island? 
[02:22:30]  Tea parties?  It was on the roof, Dick.  Yeah, it was on the roof.  It's cool on the roof.  It's cool on the roof.  All right, let me know you guys.  You guys talk.  I love that, man.  He tries to defend it.  I know.  You were in the little playhouse.  Sit right on the point, man.  And just look down like you were on the roof.  Dick.  Throwing snowballs at the cars.  You can see the next block.  Of course.  That's cool.  That's right.  That's cool. 
[02:23:00]  Big thing to collect a bunch of crab apples to throw at the return.  Tartic kid.  Yeah, hit the siding.  It's really loud.  I don't know.  Ding.  Get aluminum siding.  He's bringing up things that are just like clicking in my head.  These families.  It was a huge deal, man.  When people decided they were getting rid of those cracking asbestos shingles.  And the father. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, you're talking frigging suburbia.  The father looking outside the station wagon in the driveway.  Cleaning the siding with the host.  The perfect suburban American family.  And he's decided, yeah, he's going for it.  He's getting the aluminum siding.  And he's out there.  The trucks are out there.  It's a big neighborhood event to watch it happen.  It finally happens.  And how do the kids appreciate it?  Dude.  I bet I could dent. 
[02:24:00]  See the row right on the Mary's bedroom window?  The yellow one?  Yeah.  The yellow one.  I will dent it with this frigging rock.  Never.  Pang!  Pang!  Pang!  He'd run for like 20 feet.  And he realized no one heard it.  Run!  Run!  No one heard it.  No one heard it.  You see him out there hosing it down with his suburban dad frigging hose attachment sprayer nozzle.  And then when he gets to the dented thing, he'll just stop and shake his head. 
[02:24:30]  And, you know, it's just damn kids.  I work.  I break my back every day for this.  Hey, you bananas.  Get the hell out of here.  Christ, I pay taxes.  And you listen up, Tommy.  You tell your father I know he's rented in the Puerto Ricans.  Who did it?  And he's not paying taxes.  It was the mercandeddy child, wasn't it?  I'll talk to his father.  And I was like, oh, he's in trouble.  Ping! 
[02:25:00]  Ping!  Run, run, run, run.  Go in the bushes.  And spelling curse words in the ribs.  You see when you used to have the window air conditioning units?  And you could just take your finger and write in the metal fins that are sticking out because they're like the thinnest aluminum ever.  So all you go, F, U.  There's this poor guy busting his hump to run his house with dented aluminum siding in the air for it written on every air conditioner hanging out his window. 
[02:25:30]  And his retarded kid just got an apple on the side of his head.  And Brew is sitting on his faggy clubhouse in the back.  While a plane goes by.  Holy crap, that one was low.  We're under the pattern today.  Seemed like it was landing there, right?  Turn on the closed caption.  I can't hear my programs.  Jesus Christ, I'm writing a letter. 
[02:26:00]  This is ridiculous.  And we are not having the Concord come over.  Tomorrow, now, we're having a rally to keep that damn, goddamn plane.  This is ridiculous.  We're in Long Island.  The friggin' planes have been...  Absolutely not. 
[02:26:30]  I am not living with this goddamn thing.  Let the other...  Let the Jews over there and Hewlett deal with that.  I'm not...  I work to...  Here comes a note.  Grab the dog! 
[02:27:00]  What the hell is that?  Jesus Christ, the oil boat is backing up.  Goddamn Concord.  They move into these neighborhoods where planes have been flying over since Lucky Lindy.  And for some reason, now it's a problem.  You move there.  What do you think?  They stopped flying on the day you were shown the house?  I...  It always resorts to this.  I pay taxes.  And I'm just here to let you know I'm not... 
[02:27:30]  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Yeah.  Yeah, Concord was huge.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:28:00]  When they first started flying in.  Dudes would come out of my blog, I swear to God, I lived on Hook Creek Boulevard.  These jackasses would yell at each other and have a plan.  This is too low.  Look at that goddamn thing.  You're telling me that's regulation?  Goddamn.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, when that thing started flying, they thought the other one should be there. 
[02:28:30]  Spare did not the porch monkeys are getting closer and closer to our neighborhood.  Ma, if they can afford it, then yeah, but you sell the house then.  Holy Jesus.  Goddamn Concord.  Goddamn Concord.  Long Island rules.  Yeah.  Long Island does rule.  Bravo, Brewer.  I haven't laughed that hard since the last time you were here.  Now you know what that means? 
[02:29:00]  Awesome.  We can leave early sometime in the very near future.  Yeah, there you go.
