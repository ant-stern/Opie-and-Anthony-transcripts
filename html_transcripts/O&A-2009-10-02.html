<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Anthony Cumia's finalized divorce after a decade and the financial fallout, followed by a deep dive into David Letterman's on-air confession about an extortion attempt stemming from his admitted sexual relationships with staff members.  Extended clips from Letterman's show were played, highlighting the audience's largely amused reaction to his darkly humorous revelations. The hosts analyzed the media's portrayal of the audience response, speculating on the details of the relationships and the extortion scheme, including the use of a fake check.  Brief mentions were made of Bobby Kelly's illness and an upcoming video of Opie choking him, along with announcements of upcoming guests: Bill Burr, Vinnie Brand, and David Duchovny.  Movie reviews and trailers for *Zombie Land*, *The Invention of Lying*, and *Whip It* were shown, interspersed with commentary on various television shows including *Californication*, *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, *Parks and Recreation*, *The Office* (US and UK), *Dexter*, *Family Guy*, and *South Park*.  The Michael Jackson autopsy results were also briefly discussed.  A "Jocktober" segment featured clips from a Maine radio show.

The show then transitioned to a segment heavily featuring Marley, a Maine comedian.  Several of Marley's jokes, described as edgy and often referencing Maine locales, were played and analyzed, ranging from jokes about his wife's driving and an oversized sausage to his child's cotton candy allergy.  The hosts' reactions varied from laughter to criticism.  This section included tangents on Stephen King, "The Rock and Roll Morning Show with Bobby Russell and Mark the Shark Young" (which was mocked extensively), a caller's Obama Chia Pet anecdote, listener calls debating Marley's comedic talent, fire alarm procedures, DJ AM's accidental overdose, and the bizarre story of Ted Williams' cryogenically frozen head.  The latter half of this segment featured Vinnie Brand and Bill Burr in studio, offering commentary on Marley and sharing their own comedic experiences.

The discussion of Ted Williams' head preservation, including the use of a tuna can and subsequent damage by employees, continued into the next segment. This transitioned into a listener's account of the new Dallas Cowboys stadium, highlighting its massive size and technological features, including humorous anecdotes about overzealous fans and a fire hazard.  Bill Burr, still in studio, discussed his recent trip to Sweden and his stand-up experiences there. David Duchovny, also in studio promoting "Californication," joined the conversation.  Topics included the show's success, dealing with fame, and a cross-country road trip. A humorous segment followed where the show engineer, "Mars," struggled to pronounce Duchovny's name. The segment concluded with further discussion of "Californication" and Bill Burr's online criticism, along with Failblog clips.

The final segment featured Duchovny discussing the unreliability of internet information, online anonymity, and his past boxing career (0-1-1).  He recounted encounters with paparazzi and the segment included a showing of a Mike Tyson fight. The conversation moved to the ease of accessing old television clips online, leading to a discussion of a memorable "Six Million Dollar Man" clip.  This led to reminiscing about "The X-Files," with Duchovny sharing anecdotes about filming, including challenges with a poorly-made monster suit.  Listener calls followed, covering Duchovny's career, UFOs (with Duchovny suggesting a theory about exiled aliens), and the challenges of acting.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for Duchovny's show and Burr's stand-up performances, punctuated by repeated pronouncements of "Come to my house. We'll have a party."

[00:02:30]  i guess is to let the information out yourself and that pretty much that pretty much deflates the  balloon it was good it was gonna come out anyway he had to like uh go in front of a grand jury this uh  this david letterman yeah he uh he came up with a scheme uh a fake check that his lawyer actually gave  this guy oh really oh yeah that's coming out now too oh so it was a big sting operation it was a huge 
[00:03:00]  sting operation the guy's asking for two million basically saying he he knows that letterman's been  sleeping with some staff members or something like that we're still getting the details but basically  uh that's uh that's about right and he wanted two million so so uh they set up a little uh a little  meeting with a fake two million dollar check wow letterman wasn't on hand but his lawyer was so  then the guy started you know grabbed the check and ran and now he was walking around manhattan with a  fake two million dollar check first of all who's gonna take a two million dollar check like that 
[00:03:30]  like you're extorting you want you know unmarked bills unmarked old school give me some cash sure  that's it lots and lots of uh bags of cash yeah you want the big suitcase yeah the old you know  parking garage where they open it up you look all right you gotta find a phone booth somewhere in  new york city go old school old school call from the phone booth and say look you give me the money  right now then you gotta have a few like things all right now go to uh the museum of natural history

[00:05:00]  more serious you can see a producer in newsroom just going you know what the laughs kind of take  away from the seriousness of this we can make it look a lot worse and a lot more dramatic of a speech  that dave gave if we just cut it right after he says the big you know reveal and you get no laughter  from the audience right meanwhile the audience was was laughing because they didn't know if it was a  joke or or what yeah david is spilling his guts last night and the audience is laughing because 
[00:05:30]  yeah they think it's part of his thing they think it's some kind of wacky dave bit right but dave has a  way of doing that yeah when when he has to talk about serious stuff he gets uh you know the jokes in  yeah and get some laughs out i was wondering why my my boys over letterman haven't uh haven't been in  contact with me for the last month yeah you know we we all know him yeah yeah this is a couple guys  over there and uh they went they went cold i mean they have been like not around yeah i guess the

[00:08:30]  dude boom boom yeah i guess he's on tour with dane cook i think he flew out yesterday so did he we  won't be seeing him for a couple months all right back to letterman yeah this uh this started uh three  weeks ago uh yesterday and uh i got up i get up early and i come to work early and i go out and i  get into my car and in the the back seat of my car is a package i don't recognize and have never 
[00:09:00]  seen before and don't usually receive packages six in the morning in the back of my car  i i guess you can i guess some people do so uh i get to i gotta stop so six in the morning  yeah so he was uh at his home i i would assume i guess so that's kind of creepy because i mean  david letterman doesn't live like you know you and i meaning you know he's got all sorts of uh 
[00:09:30]  gates and security things like that i don't think it's easy to get into david letterman's  driveway to drop a package off in the back seat of one of his cars leaving his cars open is that  what you think well i guess so i guess you're right leave the locks you know lock the doors  looking through it and uh there's a letter uh in the package and it's uh it says that uh uh i know  that you do some terrible terrible things 
[00:10:00]  and i can prove that you do these terrible things and sure enough contained in the package was  stuff to prove that i do terrible things  at six in the morning and maybe this looks better to you at noon  but but six in the morning all you can think about is every terrible thing you've ever done  i i would it's funny man he's killing i i have a feeling that the audience at this point 
[00:10:30]  thinks he's just fucking around i think yeah they think he's just too hardy like oh what you know  what are you getting at it's very rupert pupkin ish where uh rupert comes out and talks about how  he tied up jerry and put him in a hotel room so he can you know do the show and everyone's laughing  like oh this is part of the bit oh my god it's exactly like he goes no but you'll find out in the  morning that this is real right right right you know they're all laughing but it was true that's  exactly what this is a rupert pupkin moment i think the audience is just thinking that he's setting up 
[00:11:00]  some big one-liner bam like he's and then paris hilton but i'm yeah paris hilton or whatever you  know lindsey lowehan but you know he's he's trying to be serious yeah yeah it continued  and he's going to take all of the terrible stuff that he knows about my life and he seems to in  this packet uh there seems to be quite a lot of terrible stuff he knows about wow the crowd has 
[00:11:30]  no idea that he's spilling his guts they're just laughing david letterman's been living in fear for  god knows how long he's finally coming clean with this whole thing he had to talk to the grand jury  and the audience is just laughing thinking he's setting some some obama joke yeah so then sarah palin  i get it okay that's where the joke was going oh dave that's a long way to go to to you know  yeah but it's dave so you know what you know what uh it was a very smart move  about this speech you can tell this is pretty well calculated right uh saying terrible things 
[00:12:00]  terrible terrible things so that people are you got it in your head like oh my god what the fuck did  this guy do and outlining all of the terrible terrible things i did uh you're you're boggled  thinking did dave kill somebody you know is there something like like you don't know it's like i i uh  murdered somebody i chopped them up on a hotel bathroom right i was weeping right there's so much 
[00:12:30]  going on here yeah so that when he comes out with the fact that it was sex right you're almost like  oh is that it yeah like it it it lowers the expectation sure of what these terrible things  are imagine it was that he killed somebody and he has like an our is it our bud dwyer or our bud dwyer  an our bud dwyer moment live on tv last night uh i was uh in a hotel with a hooker yeah uh i uh 
[00:13:00]  had killed her i choked her um i uh me i called up paul schaefer and we we cut her into uh tiny pieces  uh it's serious and uh then i um dumped her body in the hudson river  uh yeah uh no it's it's all true these were terrible things i've been a serial killer for  most of my life it's it uh started killing uh and mutilating small animals as a child 
[00:13:30]  but uh uh finally this gentleman found out the terrible things i did uh through dna because i  would normally have sex with the corpses uh no please don't laugh um i i would normally also pose  the uh dead hookers nude bodies in provocative positions on the side of highways  these are just a few of the terrible awful things i did uh some missing children i am responsible for 
[00:14:00]  them  um i've always been this way there's no cure for it um i just wanted to you know let this out because  uh someone's extorting me uh that i probably have killed upwards of 50 to 60 people  and the audience is is laughing it's just a horror story what a stupid audience 
[00:14:30]  hey dave we feel for you ah jesus christ we here at the opian anthony show feel for you my  yes the fuck you had the dumbest audience uh possible last night horrible things they're  just laughing thinking he's getting to a sarah palin joke or something here it comes  who's he gonna goof on with this joke right quite a lot of terrible stuff he knows about  it's the same bit we just did quite a lot of terrible stuff he knows about 
[00:15:00]  ah what terrible they're laughing at that that's funny  no really he he has some shit on me  unbelievable  quite a lot of terrible stuff he knows about and he's going to put it into a movie uh unless i  give him some money yeah i'm like you i think really that that's a little and this is the word i 
[00:15:30]  actually used that's a little hinky  so i get to the office and i say to myself uh i hate doing things like this but maybe i'll call my  attorney so i call my attorney uh and uh he takes a look at it and he says well let's let's schedule  a meeting with the guy just to see what he has in mind so there there's a meeting with the guy  and uh it turns out yes in fact he wants a large sum of money or he's going to produce this  screenplay of all the terrible things that i do embarrassing terrible things 
[00:16:00]  so uh at that point my attorney and i say wow this really is hinky  what the fuck i mean obviously he's trying to make light of it a little bit  yeah yeah he is trying to be very serious very serious he's really doing a great job though at  turning at an extortion plot against him with some embarrassing information into something that 
[00:16:30]  it's like you're not sitting there going oh my god this is so creepy that you're laughing yeah it's  like dave's a dirty boy all right whatever you know but uh me uh and a few of my associates um  uh had to flush a bloody bunny suit down the toilet um an awful moment um it's very hard to uh chop up a  hooker uh isn't it paul yeah yeah yeah uh very hard to get through the bones um when you're 
[00:17:00]  sawing a hooker apart with a a hacksaw but uh i i became um very fond of this practice  and uh there were terrible terrible things i did um uh one time i drove around um wearing a woman's  head as a hat uh for many hours  as the audience just laughing at his horror stories no kidding man i i beat a hooker with 
[00:17:30]  another dead hooker's arm uh one night these are terrible horrible things they they were a little  hinky little hinky when i choked that woman to death it was hinky he's been living in fear and  the audience is just kind of laughing oh yeah oh dave i wonder if he thought it was gonna go like 
[00:18:00]  that right i thought it was gonna be like oh oh like you know oh gasps and groans remember when  after 9-11 he went real serious but he threw a couple little jokes in yeah he got some laughter  uh when he had to apologize for the sarah palin thing yeah pretty serious but he got a few little  jokes in i think that's exactly what he's going for here look i'm telling you something that's  pretty damn serious and then you know he knew he'd get a couple laughs in there right they're laughing  after every sentence yeah they're laughing at the whole thing like this can't possibly be true

[00:39:30]  friends with bill so he he said do you mind if i come in with bill i said come on in man  you know and then david dacovny our old friend he's another one that's um had his uh sheriff  naughty naughty naughty naughty he got his whole life back together though i think he i think he got  his family back together i think he spent the summer reconnecting with his family by uh going cross  country i i want to ask him about that yeah supposedly he rented an rv and get the  the fuck out of here really i think so did that whole thing and just took off where you're just 
[00:40:00]  kind of stuck with your family for three thousand miles or so six thousand round trip wouldn't you  want to do that for real i know you drove cross country once with your pals but it was an all-out  we got to get there as soon as possible wouldn't you like to just i did another one though earlier  with my dad yeah and you guys took your time oh yeah we took the northern route how many how many  days probably about a week oh that's not too bad northern route there saw uh mount rushmore  how cool is mount rushmore badlands it's pretty fucking cool at night all lit up looked uh really 
[00:40:30]  cool does it look small when you're there because i yeah let me explain because when you're kind of  far away when you see the pictures it's all about the heads yeah so they look enormous obviously in  perspective of the picture you're looking at but i would imagine if you're in the area that it  actually isn't as as impressive because they have to be smaller and there's other other mountain  yeah mountains in the area and and and faces it's more so that you're far away or at least i was from 
[00:41:00]  the uh observation point that i was at uh it was a little further away still so they kind of looked  a little smaller than i would have expected but yeah cool you know you're seeing a monument then the  badlands in south dakota were pretty cool just looks like uh another planet yeah and then we just  just uh cruiser went to wall drug south dakota what's that it's one of those places or minnesota  i forgot where it is it's one of those places where there's signs like hundreds of miles before you get  there wall drug wall drug and then you finally get there and it's um you know just kind of they got 
[00:41:30]  games and a gift shop oh really yeah kind of a big touristy attraction yeah that's uh badlands  like looks really sick dude really fucking crazy rocks right oh man that's where um bad guys used  to go that's what they call the balance it's where the outlaws used to go to hide out because no one  would really go there right there's nothing there it's pretty barren shit oh that's cool that's something 
[00:42:00]  i wanted to still do and then took the southern route back and stopped off at uh the great meteor crater  mm-hmm saw that one is that cool arizona yeah that's pretty cool you realize it um no they have  some i i you might gotta be some kind of there's something on the rim and up observatory uh on the  rim and a gift shop and shit like that it's like a mile across or something like that or a couple of  miles across so if you were seeing uh let's say uh giant stadium from the air yeah it's way bigger than 
[00:42:30]  that oh fuck yeah that's fucked up that is where a meteor fucking hit the earth uh and it's really  cool to watch that's the road going in and the building on the side you can see that just a huge  size of it how deep does that go down hey maybe two three feet um yeah i used to know a lot more  about it i kind of forgot over the years and then the grand canyon of course we saw that but uh 
[00:43:00]  yeah that was pretty cool to see what was the coolest thing was like um yeah probably the grand  canyon still the grand canyon yeah that was cool though because just the fact that you know that was  made when a fucking meteor hit the earth that's like you know other planet shit right there why  can't they just turn into a big swimming pool for everybody fill it with water for everybody to  enjoy and there's fragments you could still see like um in aerial shots where the the uh like  splatter uh i guess is the best way to put it right where the rocks just shot out killed everything i 
[00:43:30]  think within a hundred mile radius at least um instantly that's very cool all right i don't know  how old it is either but pretty cool we got jock tober we got bill burr coming in soon jock tober  and believe it or not sorry david but uh we have your story of the day and it's not the david letterman  thing i'm stunned the news is all over the david letterman thing because i don't know how they could  handle the uh the story of the day to be quite frank i don't know either in great detail it would be 
[00:44:00]  very difficult to um do the story of the day i know which one you're talking about and i do dub that  story of the day it has to be if wait a minute maybe it's the same story maybe that's one of the  terrible things dave was doing oh you know something tells me it was and you're going to hear it  it involves more head uh yes  all right uh cool let's go to break opie and anthony okay okay opie and anthony 
[00:44:30]  boy i wonder if letterman's gonna get a little bump in the ratings for this one wow of course he's all  oh i mean you cannot look at the news without his face popping up there and it's in heavy rotation  this story today oh yeah and he just what had obama on a week ago yeah he he was talking to obama  knowing that the shit was going down with the extortion thing like uh yeah 
[00:45:00]  dirty dirty naughty naughty boy naughty got bill burr stopping by vinnie brand from the stress  factory david dukovny stopping in californication starting up i think this weekend it's a show i  watch and i like uh that californication big yeah yes and uh i don't even remember where the show  left off because it's been so long i think it's like wife his ex-wife but they still have sex you 
[00:45:30]  got to do the marathon i think i think she was leaving for new york was uh the last episode i  saw you do the marathon you catch up and then i saw every episode but the problem with these cable  shows they take forever to get you a new season remember what the sopranos did i know by the time that  the the new season hit you're like i don't even remember what where they were up to before  this first episode here that that was because they um they wanted to do that because they didn't 
[00:46:00]  want to tie up any loose ends so they pretty much forgot about the previous season amazing  i'll tell you one show i'm digging is uh curb your enthusiasm jesus oh yeah i know they are on  they're they got two done already yeah the first two and uh they're getting ready to bring the you  know the seinfeld cast back thing they're kind of teasing that right now but i'm not sure if  if this sunday they finally make their appearance or not yeah they do it starts oh it is this sunday  okay yeah that fucking larry david and and and you can tell the guy's barely acting he's just being 
[00:46:30]  himself i know you can tell that's exactly the guy he is he's just a prick in real life he gets all  agitated yeah so easily uh your new movies this weekend the reason why we're mentioning them we  don't mention them every friday but uh zombie land's coming out 90 positive reviews on rottentomatoes.com  i want to see that one what do you know about this zombie land zombies of course killing zombies  what's the twist though what makes this zombie movie better than the rest of the zombie movies  that came out um woody harrelson's in it harrelson the problem with woody harrelson when you see him 
[00:47:00]  in movies you go wow woody harrelson yeah he's one of those actors that kind of takes you out because  you're like oh that's woody harrelson really not the character that he's playing i think yeah no country  for old men right yeah he was in that and and it kind of took me out of the movie because i'm  thinking really oh woody harrelson yes i wasn't thinking the role he was playing i thought he's  pretty good in that one no it's no fault of him he's a great actor but he's been in so much stuff 
[00:47:30]  at this point that i don't know uh yeah you must survive uh zombie land californication started  two weeks ago that's impossible did it is that the trailer started last week oh it did okay well  i gotta wow really some fan i am this is the trailer for zombie land let's see what this is  about i want to see this i like any zombie movie harrelson playing the banjo at a supermarket 
[00:48:00]  there with a uh shotgun and here comes the first zombie takes the banjo and  welcome to zombie land nice it's like a greatest hits collection of nightmares  well you work all day you thought you wanted to play at the end of the day when your work is done  you ain't got nothing but fun i enjoy the little things i'm not easy to get along with 
[00:48:30]  and i'm sensing you're a bit of a wuss  we're actually one of the few non-zombies left because we always play it safe drive slow keep your  eyes peeled bummer we got taken hostage by a 12 year old and well girls mature way faster than boys  my sister and i are going to do whatever it takes to survive i love you love me too 
[00:49:00]  i haven't cried like that since titanic  my mother always told me someday you'll be good at something  i don't think she could have guessed that that something would be zombie  kill you time to nut up or shut up 
[00:49:30]  oh i love this song  how about we play the quiet game i've actually been meaning to ask you  will you never play the quiet game  all right a little banter all right this movie looks really good she's single right  probably more visual but you ever read that book she's just not that into you  what do you think 
[00:50:00]  i just i just love when they kill zombies i don't know why it's great yes yeah  i don't know man i want to say that absolutely it's got that chick from  fucking super bad yeah it's in there and then the the little girl from um  is that michael uh sarah  i don't think so i everybody looks like him right but i'm not i don't think it is  yeah in half the scenes it looks like him and then the other half you're like no that's not him 
[00:50:30]  so it's it's a comedy too right it yeah a lot of a lot of action but a lot of a lot of  of comedy as well bill murray is in it oh as himself oh all right okay i hope he he dies a  horrific uh zombie death oh intern paul saw it last night and i'm saying uh well apparently he's  saying that uh bill murray steals the movie well maybe paul could come in here for a few wow  paul tell us about zombie land we get a without ruining it yeah we get a nice review right here 
[00:51:00]  on the spot from uh paul yeah don't ruin it uh without giving anything away bill murray  steals the entire fucking movie it's great wow yeah is he in it a lot no oh okay but he's got a  really good scene and think old school bill murray when he was really actually funny some yeah some  kind of caddyshack thing no yeah yeah kind of all right all right very good but he plays one of the  greatest characters ever he plays bill murray yeah it's about time he goes back to being bill murray 
[00:51:30]  no that that's who he is no i understand bill murray yeah instead of being this artsy guy enough  go back to these movies that we all uh you know and do they acknowledge that he's bill murray  yeah it's like hey it's bill without giving anything away yeah that's pretty funny yeah that's  awesome i i gotta see this i might a lot of laughs it's if it's an hour and a half long i probably or  say an hour and 40 i probably laugh for an hour 20 hour and 30 there's only like two or three low  points in the whole movie otherwise it's really good like you know woody harrelson isn't exactly 
[00:52:00]  the lead so you know where you think you're just seeing woody harrelson you know killing zombies you  are but it's kind of following the kid who everyone thinks is michael cera but it's not you you thought  it was him too no i i didn't think it was him but yeah it looks like he looks like that role he looks  like a chubby michael cera yeah yeah yeah all right very cool well i want to see that i got a movie to  watch this weekend yeah i haven't wanted to go to the movies in a few weeks now i haven't 
[00:52:30]  wanted to go to the movies in years yes years and years and years zombie land 90 positive reviews  thank uh thank you paul and then the invention of uh lying that's the ricky gervais movie yes  uh and our pal louis ck's in that yeah without his goatee oh really i i saw a picture today in  the paper without his goatee and his hair kind of poofed out on the sides he looks like a real creep  i gotta see that one then so that starts uh today as well and um i was gonna say oh you don't watch 
[00:53:00]  uh parks and recreation do you no the amy poehler show it's kind of like the office it has that same  feel no uh louis ck's got got a nice part in that in that nbc show he's the love interest of um amy  poehler really as it he's a cop that's kind of like not as smart as amy poehler to say the least  and uh and now there's like a little love thing happening and he's gonna be on the show for i  think the rest of the season that was pretty cool fucking louis ck and last night he was he was great 
[00:53:30]  on the show we'll never see him again no of course not that's it he's done yeah he's done for this show  i think so it was good having you louis now go be a big star watching the the original office  again last night british just popped in yeah the british office that season two just popped it in and  fucking gervais is brilliant in that he absolutely is you can't even describe how good he is in that 
[00:54:00]  you gotta think that the uh the american office they want ricky gervais to kind of do something  yeah i bet you that they're just trying to negotiate it you gotta think that that they  would love to see that happen but gervais we've talked to him enough times he's done with it yeah  i know he's fucking done with it and but we're not done with seeing him but they stopped it it was  perfect how they they ended it you just wanted more of this character yeah but they ended it and  that was it it was over but um you watch the american version of the office now now it's just going too 
[00:54:30]  long um but it's still that what's his name the character is fucking just retarded now steve carell  yeah carell right carell is playing a retard he's not playing a like douchey embarrassing boss  gervais did like he just gervais had no confidence but tried to exude so much confidence and he was  constantly nervous and ticky and that that's the character not this retard that carell is playing 
[00:55:00]  which he didn't play in the first couple of seasons of the office you're absolutely right  well gervais was i mean he's believable as a real person like this person exists like you can go to  work and this is your boss uh michael scott uh is just not he's not a person that exists like he's  just literally he's a he's retarded man you wouldn't see that yeah you wouldn't see that at work and  what season are we up to for the american office gotta be five six i think because the english  office was two seasons that was it yep yeah and i tapped out i liked the american office i was a fan 
[00:55:30]  yeah i was at the beginning and then what happened with me i someone said if you like that you gotta  go and watch the english office so i got the box set watched it within a weekend and and i think i was  done with the american office right there then you couldn't even watch it in a couple seasons i mean  they're probably still doing great in the ratings and it's still a really good show i just i just tapped out  i'm done yeah done with that show i don't like um and i i know uh travis uh concurs with this one 
[00:56:00]  because i read his tweet huh i don't like the fact that they took off seinfeld at night  everywhere on tbs and fox yes tbs and fox 7 30 11 put on the office oh really yeah seinfeld out  office in out seinfeld's on at like like midnight or like 12 30 now yeah how many how many episodes of  seinfeld can you watch let me tell you them every single one but every time they're on i could watch  but it got to a point it was on how many times a day not enough not enough i i can watch every 
[00:56:30]  single episode i don't care how many times i've seen it i just i i think it's hysterical you know  in the heyday of uh i probably talked about this already but in the heyday of seinfeld i didn't watch  so there's probably i would i would say i haven't seen 75 of wow the seinfeld episodes for real because  when it was on i was doing night radio or afternoon drive yeah so i i missed that whole seinfeld thing 
[00:57:00]  and i got the box set it would be great if i just started watching it because yeah most of it would be  brand new for me gervais dancing it's dancing it's just trying to raise money yeah raising money yeah  also uh anthony michael moore's movie starts this weekend a love story capitalism whatever yeah 73  positive reviews and then what's this movie whip it getting 78 positive reviews whip it do we know  what whip it is about i think that is drew barrymore's directorial debut oh right right right oh that's the 
[00:57:30]  um roller derby roller derby movie the girls kind of look hot in that they kind of look hot in that  roller derby shit i must say there i saw them dressed up like girl scouts or something they  dressed up like girl scouts doing some uh some moves some yeah some moves i was all in with this  drew barry more but her mouth really is looking like a stroke victim now yeah she it went from this  cute little little tiny little tick to to now it's just it's almost like full stroke mouth now 
[00:58:00]  yeah her mouth is starting to look like when um when the little kid in ai ate uh the spinach  hailey joel osmond ate the spinach and he wasn't supposed to  everyone's coming up with their favorite seinfeld episode you know what i i'm gonna go all in  and fuck it finally yeah you just have to i mean i've i've seen goddamn funny man i've seen enough 
[00:58:30]  but there's a lot of episodes i just have not seen wow i am so like my no i i came in here all  of a sudden the inside of my nose is itching like a motherfucker right and uh i'm like you didn't get  it for me you didn't get it for me start sucking snot well what i got is not the flu this is just a  a horrendous allergy attack is it probably from the fucking wet leaves let's be hay fever thank you 
[00:59:00]  bobby i feel better though today look at that you just talk about things and i'm i have judge report  up here all the time right and now at the top of the judge report yeah is seinfeld saying what it's  the curb your enthusiasm thing but i just looked and it says it's got seinfeld all up there like do  they hear you i know is that what it is with advertising on the web nowadays they just hear what  you're saying and that's what pops up it's really fucked up sometimes the coincidence is a little  much a little creepy a little creepy all right uh what else is going on in the world oh the autopsy 
[00:59:30]  shows that michael jackson was actually really healthy yeah apparently he was well within his uh  you know the weight to height ratio and uh they said he was a healthy drug addict yeah but he did have  fluid in his lungs yeah his inflamed lungs but you know his chemistry was pretty good and they said  that he was still pumping out sperm what how'd they know that well i'm meaning you know he j-o the  fucking corpse who i don't know but yeah yeah hey hey what's we need to know uh i have an embarrassing 
[01:00:00]  thing i did um i jerked off michael jackson's corpse and um it's terrible awful things being extorted for  but uh because a lot of people thought he was sterile turns out he can make his makes he can  make uh make the sperm so why didn't it well you know that even that proves it even more that he did  not want a black child you know he he went his whole life trying to transform himself into a white 
[01:00:30]  person yeah and then his kids he didn't want to have those genes uh of the original little michael  jackson who would have you know i don't care how much plastic surgery and skin bleaching and  everything else and hair straightening and wigs when you pump out that sperm that sperm didn't have  any fucking corrective surgery that shit is that's gonna come out like the wide nose big afro michael  jackson i was gonna use the word nappy yeah that's what he had a big afro but it's weird if if you want 
[01:01:00]  to be a father and your spermies are working yeah why would you then not use your own spermies i don't  get it that's what i'm saying yeah i just don't understand that i i mean you're trying you're trying  to make the point but still i'm thinking yeah you would want maybe a piece of your right you're uh i  mean i understand there's guys out there they they can't make their own spermies anymore but they still  want to have a family so they do other things i get it but if you're making your own spermies you want  you want your own kids no yeah i guess so i don't what a weird what a weird fuck you think 
[01:01:30]  it's ever going to come out with all this shit oh i thought you meant his jizz no that's stuck in  in there would you buy a vial of michael jackson's jizz no why not why because you could just drain it  from a young boy's hiney just to put it on display yeah like memorabilia yes that's way better than a  dumb autograph you know fluids don't hold up very well after a while it would just be this brown 
[01:02:00]  crusty shit in the bottom of a test tube and you'd be like you know what this was brown what's wrong  with his spermies well when everything dries up it turns brown and you know what someone give me  you know what kevin from connecticut you're right too many people have uh tried to turn me on to this  dexter show you watch dexter i did i didn't i did and now i didn't again i kind of like a couple of  seasons i thought were good a couple stunk yeah no yeah and i never really got never really got 
[01:02:30]  hooked hooked a lot of people say it's the best show on tv dexter's great it's good you still you  still watch travis yeah absolutely yeah john lithgow's in it this year which i think he's gonna be real  good yeah he's a creepy serial killer yeah i see him walking around uh the upper west side every once  a while oh my god creep oh really you're thinking a little more um hey i don't know what he's up to  but does he seem a little i don't know what's up with him but he would play a great serial killer 
[01:03:00]  that's for sure oh yeah a creep uh this fucking asshole cody in indiana a regular to the ona show  what's up cody hey isn't it a bit late for you to fucking jump on the seinfeld bandwagon  it sure is a little bit i think that i might get a hee-haw shot after all these  hey hee-haw yeah you know what everyone does have that show when you're going around the  the old dial yeah gold school here and you see a show on you go i i now have to watch yeah for me  it's family guy yeah they're playing family guy about four times a day now and i don't care if i've 
[01:03:30]  seen the episode i'm i'm in every freaking time i just started watching and getting into south park  really yeah like i i mean i watched like the first season when it was new and then i kind of just let  it go for a while and now they got like the first 10 seasons on instant netflix right so i've watched  about 10 years of south park in the last month and a half wow like i'm just like i'm just making south  park jokes like with travis he's like yeah he's like he's like yeah dude it's eight years old yeah what  are you talking about i bought a towely towel i'm kind of behind with south park i haven't watched in

[01:19:00]  but um i saw a commercial for obama chia pet head the other day and i thought uh anthony would get a  kick out of it as an obama chia pet head oh yeah it's quite uh the racist thing but uh he grows  like curly uh green hair out of his head that's good that's funny hey is that uh is that a true  i'm sorry sir you're that's okay we're done with you um is that a true statistic what yes yes sir  the this morning show okay uh that we're listening to for october this morning the rock and roll morning 
[01:19:30]  show is number one in their market that's what it says on their website one in their market well  yeah that's wow that's impressive that really is um let's see what market that is oh it's market 223  223 it's rock and roll when you first started when you first start out in radio you you work these  little markets yeah i've been there there's a big shark in a small pond and you dream of the day that 
[01:20:00]  you could break the top 100 yeah in market sizes well they got a far uh long way to go and then you  hope to break top 50 and then hopefully maybe someday break into the top 10 top 10 is like huge i'm sure  they're young guys and they're uh making their way yeah that's it that's not correct no unfortunately  not they've been uh they've actually both been working in radio for many years oh well with the the likes of  marley uh helping them out yeah i see them in market you know like 205 within 10 years yeah yeah 
[01:20:30]  you think they're gonna have a big decision to make do we do we leave bangor for wilkesbury you  know something wilkesbury is way up there wilkesbury was like market 70 i think yeah right in the 70s  yeah you'd be they were really taking a leap then if they got a phone call from wilkesbury they would  jump at the market they would no they would they would probably sit there and go you know we're  number one here in bangor this is great we're steven king's station our family i don't know do we do  this to our families i don't think barley can come with us so that we got to stay local with wilkesbury 
[01:21:00]  and his accent just wouldn't cut it over there i wow what decisions to make do we change his name  from mark the shark gonna have to come up with something different i think something for wilkesbury they  are offering us 37 000 a year though yeah that's oh god damn that's a 50 increase in my pay because  they'd have to move to overnights in wilkesbury but it does cause the cost of living in wilkesbury  wow that's really a lot more than here in bangor uh yes jack sabbath thank you chris in georgia 
[01:21:30]  jack sabbath that would be fred zeppelin's jack sabbath that would be fred zeppelin's uh co-host  oh that would be there you go i was that's the that's the perfect one right there motley stew  does he come on at some point and breaking news this is this is very sad mongo the trucker's been  up there with his uh with his big rig uh mongo uh yeah i heard they fired uh fred zeppelin and  they have hired byron maiden byron maiden oh no and uh who comes on after him isn't it uh ace ace ace

[01:22:30]  just a little boy said here comes mark the shark it's mark the shark he's dangerous i like when  uh they put our names in the paper and they put quotation marks around anthony like like it's a  character and my name's bob or something no it's anthony you don't have to put quotation marks around  that's my fucking name that's funny uh jersey joe jersey joe ah good evening hey evening i hear from  midnight to 4 a.m he becomes the grateful fred oh grateful fred very good everyone's got their uh

[01:25:00]  elvis fan and from bayshore is uh an elvis um aficionado because he made a fat joke about  elvis and said when he was uh in hawaii why but but blue hawaii when he was doing the movies and  stuff like that he was still the young fucking stud right yeah yeah i believe he was it's on the  delivery though the delivery was there oh is that it like the facts don't matter yeah if the joke is  good yeah exactly what if both are not there we got another clip of marley yeah holy 
[01:25:30]  shit maybe you could use some of these jokes around the water cooler after the show  aloha from hawaii was 1973 elvis was 175 pounds that is steve from bayshore talking um i don't think  that's fat elvis not at all 175 unless he was four foot eight yeah marley does some material about his  two-year-old this is how we ended the night we found out that my two-year-old was allergic to cotton  candy oh yeah he started eating cotton candy his face dwelled right up oh yeah big had to have 
[01:26:00]  the ambulance come oh wow oh oh yeah yeah you know how much the ambulance ride is 800 bucks  what do they got a stripper pole in there  i don't get it i don't like why would the ambulance have ambulance the bambulance yeah have a stripper  pole well it's so expensive to get someone to the hospital yeah for that kind of money you would  yeah you'd hope it'd be a party bus party bus by the way we'll we're looking at pictures of elvis from 
[01:26:30]  hawaii could be elvis at his skinniest ever ever it is the skin look at it he's in great shape  that's the elvis all the women wanted a bag you fucking idiot he picked the absolute wrong elvis  wouldn't it be vegas that would be that would be a safe bet i'm sure vegas elvis the elvis right  before he died right you know that's the fat elvis that is elvis at his prime right there but in 
[01:27:00]  comedy you want to remind people of a happier time like you don't want to remind people you don't want  to bump people out by bringing up elvis dying or a good joke right okay okay i see that i see that  counterpoint let's get back to the kid material because nothing says good radio than kid material  yeah talking about your your wife i don't know why his face blew up from cotton candy let's find out oh  pull in there some kind of open box i don't know pour some sugar on me poor kid who's lady gaga in 
[01:27:30]  there dancing with him these don't make sense lady gaga she's a this guy why would lady gaga be in  the ambulance in the ambulance for 800 bucks i mean put it this way for a private show in an ambulance  that ain't isn't isn't a bad price for lady gaga i would i would definitely raise the lady gaga is 
[01:28:00]  not the person that comes to mind if you're thinking that some some hot famous person is  going to dance for you didn't she sing pour some sugar on me uh no i believe yeah that was jeff  leopard who does uh middays over there okay oh some sugar on me poor kid who's lady gaga in there  dancing with him it's out of control that's why i've decided i'm gonna open up my own ambulance  company are you really well that's i was in there here comes the funny here comes the funny he is 
[01:28:30]  gonna bring it oh boy is he if his last name uh kevin from connecticut wants to know if marley's  last name is davidson no marley davidson because he's wild that was that would fit marley davidson  you're an ass that's great i like it and with them while they were taking them all they were  saying you're okay buddy you're okay well i can talk to people put it right in the back of my ford  f-150 i'll put a cap on it yeah you can call 1-800-BOBS-AMBU any of your people up there in veezy got 
[01:29:00]  problems yeah uncle bobby come up and get you in this board and bring you to the i'll only charge  you 400 half price that's right we can stop it divas on the way out through is he speaking a  foreign language no there's there's i guess a lot of language of unfunny yeah a lot of uh local  references about i guess strip clubs yeah we just don't get it hospitals and ambulance uh we don't 
[01:29:30]  get it it's local they keep it local see this satellite radio we're in we're in a lot of trouble  sam because we don't go local yes regular radio they know how to do that local break and we can't  do that with satellite radio people don't like to listen to the radio if they don't feel like their  uh disc jockeys are are right there with them we're in trouble because we don't go local we're in we're  in big trouble sam i think you're right yeah is so bad this is so bad how bad is it marley well it's so 
[01:30:00]  bad it could cost you 400 just to get to the hospital ah it's giving me quite a headache here  pour some sugar on me ah sugar gives me a headache cause it's you know like uh gets you all pumped  up why is he doing a sugar joke there because his son had a reaction to cotton candy or something i  would assume that's stripper pole yeah the stripper pole because then you would play deaf  leopard music because that's what's played in a lot of the strip clubs in bangor i think marley's 
[01:30:30]  smarter than that though yeah because there's a sugar thing i think there's a sugar tie-in somehow  oh from the cotton besides that being a good strip i just think it's strip i think he went completely  off the sugar at that point and just went with the song being played in strip clubs there's a pole  in the ambulance lady gaga lady gaga's in there the brilliance that is with the swollen face from the  cotton candy marley's just he's so multi-faceted we just found the new richard prior sam this is  unbelievable i like the image of marley watching this ambulance come and thinking i can make 
[01:31:00]  something funny out of this and he's writing about his life experiences found out my kid had the  diabetes we got nicole in maine she she wants in bad uh nicole how are you nicole oh well hello let  me try this again nicole so so i used to live in bangor but i have since moved down to portland which is  the big city in maine oh yeah yeah yeah moving on up years ago they put you guys on the radio on my 
[01:31:30]  favorite radio station at the time you're on there for maybe a year and then they took you off and  they ended up replacing you with a fabulous morning show called robin's zodiac zone and robin tells  people for scoops and we got replaced for a horse that figures what the  is wrong with regular radio damn you would think they they replaced us with maybe a local flave  local flave morning show robin's zodiac zone robin's zodiac zone 
[01:32:00]  holy check it out guys you'll love it i am depressed now thanks nicole thanks did you ever  did you know that we were replaced for that hit i had no clue well you guys never do psychic  greetings no no of course and you're not horse shit and you're not local here's something sam we  we try not to talk vague here we try to get to it try to get to the point get to the parent right 
[01:32:30]  don't you think a horoscope that relates to over a million people in the paper is horse  shit well not if it relates to your sign give me my horoscope i'll i'll tell you if it's if it's  accurate or not horror horoscope horror if it was on stephen king's oh wow the horror scope  that's what they do on halloween i bet sam i'm a gemini so once a year once you read my horror scope  where are the horror scopes in the paper i fucking don't know they still have them 
[01:33:00]  i have no fucking idea probably by the comics right by the gamics you think those hysterical  comics oh boy this letterman oh boy oh he's all over boy it's uh huge oh boy i had sex with staff  that could mean so many things yes it could mean the entire staff men and women or that he just had  sex with like a staff you know like um that moses carried around with him which would be very  embarrassing too uh or he had sex with an infection he could have had they should really clear that up 
[01:33:30]  uh people saying that robin is hot from the zodiac zone good for her is she hot yeah she's not bad  all right well that's my little myspace trickery or are we going to be able to see a photo that's what  that's what you need from your radio her uh her myspace is private i'd have to private how do you  have a she's on the myspace if you're on the radio you found it sir yeah danny help me find the horror  scopes all right what what's your sign again mine's gemini oh that fits you so well that's what so 
[01:34:00]  many people the duality that's what so many people tell me aunt the two sides of uh greg opie hughes  unpredictable yes a little crazy at times you're like greg the shark  fucking assholes okay what do we got today get ready to be freaked out all right communication  and commerce that's where you you know you're a communicator your radio dj right planet mercury 
[01:34:30]  is having an effect on your home and family you have both those things so saying what you mean to  someone can be easier than you thought being comfortable about your decisions in life  is a nice peaceful feeling to have but you may have to wait a week a week or two for all the  pieces to fall into place don't worry opie they will oh that is so fake how and then they get they  give you an out if this shit doesn't happen right at time yeah right away they give you a fucking two 
[01:35:00]  weeks no it's a couple weeks and by then you forgot about it right and you're reading the next horoscope  so you know it doesn't matter all right uh what's mine i would be yeah as uh the show is um uh  horseshit uh i am bull bull torus the bull torus the bull that fits you perfectly that fits me very very  well usually usually i just sit graze everything's fine and dandy i could take a lot but you rile me  up a little too much oh yeah and you're gonna get the you know you mess with the bull you're gonna get 
[01:35:30]  the horns that's right right you uh you're the definition of of uh taurus yeah you certainly  that's me i am definitely taurus by the way these reports are coming from uh jennifer angel  oh so we gotta be uh accurate anthony if you need to say something to get it off your mind  then do so without delay hey sam you're a dick why would you come on let me finish it said without  delay i know if it's a personal matter then mercury the communication planet which we discussed 
[01:36:00]  earlier yes will help you convey your viewpoints in a diplomatic way so that others will not only  listen but take notice be careful of always having the answers and not allowing others to contribute  their point of view the way to build relationships oh shit anthony's going solo respect other people  that was pretty funny respect other people right i'll give that a try so maybe you could be weird 
[01:36:30]  for you yeah it's something new it's gonna be a little strange for you i could have said sam i think  you're a dick here's why oh okay and then let me but it said without delay that's why i didn't want  to even wait for the rest of the horoscope but now i realize i should have that's true so now  instead of me doing with the horoscope now i've read the horoscope and i'm affected by it and that's  why i would do it which makes it stupid you probably do it anyway because it's right there don't read  my horoscope i don't want it to affect the future who will create a chain reaction yes um i'm getting

[01:52:30]  by association thing with radio it's like radio is if you've been on this show oh you're persona non  grunt it's don't talk about it it's prison and i'm wearing the wrong colors yeah and i walked down  the wrong corridor thinking i'm in the aryan section and i'm in the mexican gang session  you're the princesses yeah no it's bad so all right so bob marley's funny yeah no he's great  yeah he's really goddamn funny yeah all right yeah totally vouched for him 
[01:53:00]  yeah i'm serious vouched for and everything i know we killed him yeah destroyed him should have  you know maybe chimed in a little earlier before we completely destroyed him and i'd like to say  that if i'm ever in banger i would love to do the show boys oh i don't give a shit well who cares  well maybe we move on from uh jocktober for a little bit maybe oh you want you want to hear a good  road story me and joe de rosa all right we're walking working the improv and uh uh um so i'm not  gonna say where just in case they're listening there so these two who is come out to the show 
[01:53:30]  sit in the front row you know titties out the whole damn thing right talk to them later you figure out  that i'm pretty much thinking that they're strippers right so it's the end of the weekend i had a great  weekend and uh you know the whole staff everybody's going out so you know i'm buying some rounds so the  first who comes in and you know i just bought joe a drink i'm like hey you want something to drink  she's like yeah yeah so i get a drink we're talking or whatever and then like 10 minutes later the  second one comes walking and and just like a stripper she totally is you know breaks the whole  situation down there's my friend she has a drink i know she didn't pay for it what's the nearest dick 
[01:54:00]  to that drink and she sees me okay now this the first the first girl was cool like the first stripper  was cool but the second girl had a voice that literally could break the glass on those flat screens  i wanted to fucking choke her so she comes up to the bar and she just says hey titties all over the  bar she looks at me she's like hey bill she's like what are you drinking and i already know 
[01:54:30]  what she's doing i'm like well i'm drinking an oktoberfest and then there's like an awkward pause  and she's just like how is it oh and i'm like and i'm like well it's delicious right and then once  again typical stripper she's like well there's no money to be made here moves to the next dick which  is joe and then she goes joe what are you drinking and joe gets this shitty grin on his face and he goes  a bud light why would you like to buy me one dude and i just me and the other stripper just start 
[01:55:00]  laughing our asses off and now this girl's like caught she's like what what you don't think i'll  buy around i'll buy around and then joe and then joe goes yeah why don't you buy it buy around why  don't you pay it forward for every fucking guy who ever bought you a goddamn drink and you took it  and you walked away i think you should buy me and my good friend bill burr a drink and he got it all  way up to her getting us both a beer and a shot and we're laughing her asses off as she's sitting  there saying that she's gonna do it so the round comes over we think it's you know that she paid  for on the slide she put it on her boyfriend's credit card she tried to do that and the waitress 
[01:55:30]  busted her and then in the end she ended up putting on her atm card and when we got the drinks we said  hey thanks a lot and we both got up and walked away  ah revenge oh you know i love joe i had no idea that he hated women more than me  you should have seen when he realized what she was doing his head somehow he was sitting onto the  right side of me and his head was going past me he's sticking his neck out so far with this

[01:59:30]  yeah and they're all dressed like whores and there's this vibe that everybody's sort of fucking each  other there's always like this sexual tension in there that's the new news yeah that's like the new  thing to have you know like you know look at that what we got right there it's kind of you know  just sitting there well she's got a little she's the one that goes my husband entertainment reporter  yeah all right well here's a newsreader fuck it up listen to this one lawmakers in michigan  failed to reach an agreement yesterday on spending cunts cuts in an attempt to balance the budget 
[02:00:00]  that's my favorite  spending that one happens a lot  a wife or girlfriend  lawmakers in michigan failed to reach an agreement yesterday on spending cunts  cuts in an attempt to balance the budget that means the time state workers show up today  it could be sent right back home essential services services rather like police and prisons  will continue running i like how she flubbed the next couple of words she's just like out of all  i just said cunt that's the worst how many how many get back on my agent did you just say cunt 
[02:00:30]  like a reporter lawmakers in michigan failed to reach an agreement yesterday on spending cunts  that was cunts there's no uh ifs ands or buts yeah i i say the f word a lot on uh on shows we're not  allowed to say and they don't realize i say it because i was i was about to say like fucking  and i stop at the k but i i was like what are you fucking you can't like uh yeah yeah yeah  it's okay kind of like hello once the c comes out you don't need the k but i keep going i wait for 
[02:01:00]  them to dump and they don't and i'm like all right nobody noticed i really just said it there but  that's fortunately i kind of mumble yeah they'll nail you on that we should do we should do the  story of the day yeah i love this one and having a bill in here for this one you know bill it's a  boston legend ted williams is back in the ted williams story that is he alive now did they screw  his head onto a frozen torso it involves his head last we left ted williams his yeah his head was just 
[02:01:30]  frozen upside down left yo upside down for some reason it's upside down yes so it doesn't leak out  yeah oh it's like a pumpkin yeah you don't want all the juices leaking out of the neck put a handle  on the bottom like one of those kettle balls you work out with this is a a horrible story they might  as well have bill because they're doing some horrendous things to the uh the head to ted  williams ted williams head where's the story and i don't have it in front of me oh my god i don't  have it in front of me but i read i read the whole fucking thing okay listen to this this is what's 
[02:02:00]  going on with ted williams apparently well we we all remember back in the uh day when uh ted williams  died there was a lot of controversy because his son uh said fuckhead that he is yeah yeah fuckhead  that well he's dead now too and i think they froze him he died of leukemia uh ted williams son and they  died that they uh they froze him too i think they did well anyway he said that ted wanted to be frozen  cryogenically frozen so that if a cure for whatever mailed him death uh ever uh came around 
[02:02:30]  way in the future they could take his uh his brain and somehow reanimate him in some way shape or form  um that's why they only saved his head which i all thought was ridiculous until about two weeks ago  but continue all right i'm sure there you go please hold that fucking bill burn thought  because i thought it was the dumbest thing i ever heard in my life but continue continue well i think we  should hear bill first all right this is what you're hoping is going to happen to your head 
[02:03:00]  and then it will explain what happened to ted's head yeah a little different all right awesome okay  well most of my conspiracy theory obviously is based on losers on wikipedia and youtube that's true  this is actually a website ted.com where they have actual like science they actually have uh  like real scientists and they have all kinds of different things like what's going to be in like  the future like literally like uh like you know whatever you like your iphone yeah some of the  computer graphics this guy's like moving stuff around and all these tech geeks are like oh my god  freaking out but then they have some of these medical things and they showed this whole thing 
[02:03:30]  where like when you're like a baby and like a baby and she had a baby man and the uh okay there's two  words lady lady and baby i can't say without doing either impression but like the first one the baby's  first whatever the first trimester if somehow it loses a limb you have the ability to regrow a uh an  entire limb really evidently like a fucking gnat and also a newborn baby if the tip of its finger  gets uh accidentally cut off i don't know how the fuck it would but in the first like like six months 
[02:04:00]  it will regrow nail and all yeah but then yeah i cannot believe that yeah i dude you think look at  me i have no medical background i will show i'll show you the video i'll find it during the break so  basically they're trying to tap into being able to turn that back on in your body and basically  talking about being able to regenerate all organs i was i mean i'm too stupid to explain it but i was  looking at this and i was like do you know what if this is basically saying if you had enough money  that when you were 90 years old like a car you could do a body off restoration right of yourself 
[02:04:30]  and just reattach it you could essentially i'm not gonna say live forever but you could definitely  get another 60 years i don't know what they do about another life or so out of you or the skin  yeah no no they could redo the skin they are working on fuck yeah they were taking like uh  all that that stem cell stuff and they were talking about how people who usually have like  a colostomy bag like they grew like another like a piece of intestine it was unbelievable  steven s writes then why doesn't a baby's foreskin grow back bill oh oh that's easily explained by 
[02:05:00]  someone with a medical background i have no idea how the fuck would i know that dude this guy he  had the lab coat on he had a stethoscope all right dude have you guys been trashing those assholes  who go on oprah and they're still in their scrubs oh yeah yeah yeah do you have any idea i saw that  yesterday matter of fact why do you know do you understand that if you actually have scrubs and  you're doing any sort of surgery the amount of blood spatter that is on those fucking things 
[02:05:30]  it's disgusting it's not neat it's just tv scrubs though man yeah yeah they're all scrubbed up  they're all scrubbed cleaned up right out of the laundry because you gotta know that we just ironed  this you gotta know you're listening to a doctor yeah if you're a construction worker you walk out  with a hammer on your belt you know just the fact that you can actually intelligently talk about  construction i should know that right do you have to come out there like an iced coffee  yes anybody else want to add some to this hilarity no sorry well so i'm thinking like who the hell 
[02:06:00]  knows maybe they could actually let's you know come to divine does you know some sort of corkscrew  and they could screw ted williams frozen head on head on it i would just love to watch that hose  he thaws out and then i'll just yeah so i was always saying 21 20 there's a black guy president  what the fuck is going on he said well you know we don't have to freeze his whole body 
[02:06:30]  we can freeze his head so yes that's some nice thoughts bill but this is what is really happening  with uh the head that was frozen oh i didn't have my finger on the pulse you're kind of there  they uh they it's nice they freezing the whole body takes a lot some people do that but this  particular uh method is just freezing the head hoping that sometime in the future you could take  the brain um and somehow reanimate it and uh put it into something it's got to be so far in the future 
[02:07:00]  that it's stuff we don't even understand so yeah that's what they're waiting for but  uh this place didn't seem to be the the best place to do this first of all they just found  out like little things like around these cryogenic tanks it are just boxes and garbage and junk  piled up files like file cat instead you know those big cardboard things with files in them  they're just stacked up next to the cryogenic freeze you're picking this sterile environment 
[02:07:30]  looking like the future no it's a warehouse and they're just throwing shit in where we need  some room fuck and put it next to ted williams every now and again the power goes off oh yeah  yeah and it's supposed to have all kinds of backup generators this thing is supposed to  keep running everything's fine what's he gonna die again everything's fine everything is fine  fine don't worry about it filed by ted's head yeah put it by ted's head and it's supposed to you  know the power is supposed to be uninterrupted for like two thousand years to this place because 
[02:08:00]  once the power goes out and they thaw that's it yeah so one bad storm and there goes that idea  but the freezing someone at the telephone one divorce by the right guy in the company  yeah yeah yeah they they also say the freezing itself fucks up the the tissue uh but they're  hoping in the future that's like ice cream he's got that freezer burn you get freezer burn in the  brain it doesn't taste right so what what happened was they used um they said some kind of archaic 
[02:08:30]  tools and method to remove ted's head hammer and chisel so yeah it wasn't they saw that right off  there had to be a saw it had to be just a saw a hacksaw from like fucking the hardware store  ace hardware oh they're saying when they took it when they initially took it off his body  they just cut it off with some archaic method they said again so it could have been anything  like a pocket knife a fucking buck knife it has to be an archaic method there's no new method to  remove a head remove a head but you would think again this place being this futuristic we will 
[02:09:00]  cryogenically freeze you and you would be reanimated in the future you think like they're  using a laser to take your head off some horrific scene that's really good make a minimum wage with  a hatchet blood splattering on the wall that truly is one of the great scams like i always wanted to  meet these guys who make a million dollars off like those those 1995 just go drinking with them  because you know after a couple drinks they just start laughing yeah you know what's that one you guys  the the shuggle whatever the hell it's called the the blanket shirt oh the uh snuggie snuggie 
[02:09:30]  snuggie yeah the shuggle snuggie's back shovel that went away fast well no there's new snuggies  out now designer snuggies yeah different patterns oh thank god different colors leopard skin and  things like that oh yeah they look great look at that fucking thing it's a blanket asshole  they have that on american airlines it's one of those airline awful oh i'd love to see those  floating in the ocean and some fucking burning wreckage with one lone them one lone suitcase snuggie  and some sneakers so what were they doing with ted's head yeah so uh they took they took uh ted's head 
[02:10:00]  off uh and then they freeze it now for some reason they embed microphones into his head uh into the skull  and then they dip it into some kind of liquid nitrogen and bring the temperature down to minus  320 degrees they heard on the microphones ted williams brain cracking 16 times there's a recording 
[02:10:30]  of his brain cracking yeah it's 16 times just like an ice cube it's like anything else yeah you ever put  ice ice in a warm drink and it just goes that's what happened to ted's is the reality bill if you're  wake up with a severe headache oh my fucking head's killing me yeah it gets way worse than then they  put it then they put him into the cryogenic head freezing compartment um which uh you can't just lay 
[02:11:00]  his round head in the thing because then it would kind of tip over and lean on the side it's not  supposed to touch the casing what they propped it up with they put the top of his head and rested it  like a golf ball on a tee on a bumblebee tuna fish can that is what ted williams hands getting  depressed was wow was sitting on and i guess for some reason anything better you're gonna wake up  hungry some kind of pedestal tungsten it's it's made of tungsten so it doesn't damage the something 
[02:11:30]  platinum you know something to the so the price is justified it's an empty bumblebee trophy bases  with that little cheesy piece of velvet exactly something but they they put it in a tuna fish  uh can then at some point they needed to uh take his head out i don't even think they needed to i  think some people were taking pictures with his head yes some people that work there were taking  photographs with ted williams frozen hair how bad do you want to see one of those pictures oh come on 
[02:12:00]  so then they they they had to do something about the tuna fish can because it was now stuck  to the top of ted's head so one of the employees that's when they turn his head back on  they're gonna wait till it melts  always look for the slider  and they store them upside down neck up that's wrong yeah well they have to because it would leak 
[02:12:30]  yeah dopey's right it would be frozen it's rest on the neck it's something but it's on pumpkin it's  on the top of his head now he's got a bumblebee tuna fish hat on his head so they got to remove  the bumblebee tuna fish thing so one of the employees grabs a monkey wrench and starts swinging  at this tuna fish can misses misses smacks his 317 degree below zero face where now pieces crack off of  his face and fly across the room his nose went across the room something he missed with a monkey wrench 
[02:13:00]  fucking and hit a frozen fucking solid head so it cracked how do we go there to steal his head  it cracked the right thing for him and uh apparently they they put it back in and uh you know froze him  up again but uh uh they're just allegations of this is what they have to say to them to say listen  that by the time we unfreeze this guy if did the technology exists to screw this guy's head back 
[02:13:30]  onto some other torso you think his nose being detached is really going to be a problem it'll be  nothing they'll be able to put a new nose on where's the mic i want to talk to the mic what what year is  it holy shit all right yeah he's done he's finished i got yeah he's done i i guess the future uh thing is 
[02:14:00]  they're they think they could grab the essence of who you are out of your brain and completely put  maybe put it in some kind of autonomy automated thing automaton or uh uh maybe some cloned thing  but uh you're not actually going to be using the head and brain that is now cracked like a fucking ice  cube they might as well just use the bus they have of them in the hall of fame at this point  trying to reattach that to a body they are they they should just take some brain tissue maybe 
[02:14:30]  and freeze it and then hope they can then clone you and by having some of your brain  uh you know here's an idea just bury you it's over exactly there you go it's a new thought  who wants to come back to this mess it's a fucking mess just die already is that yeah that's pretty  much it they took it over the rest of his body and uh uh you know plus it is kind of selfish for  him to want to come back it's like you know really you didn't get enough out of life one of the 
[02:15:00]  greatest hitters of all time you played a sport war hero war hero how much pussy do you think you  got on the road please yeah was it his idea to come back i don't know was it his family that's just  it his son i think it was his son his son had that will that was all like you know you know these  out on a napkin why they need that tuna can off his head what was the deal i don't know for some  reason they needed that tuna can off maybe like people are coming by to inspect something it's  like oh we've got to get the real piece here i don't think we could use this tuna can they're  going to be very upset maybe the family was coming by for father's day so they want to make sure 
[02:15:30]  it smells like fish presentable fucking fishy smelling hair why don't you leave the label on we  could have told me when you look through the ice you can actually see it yeah did i say star kissed  my dad's head resting in a tuna fish can how much do i pay we could do a little more jocktober  jocktober you want to do a little jocktober with us bill absolutely yeah i can tell you i went to  the monday night dallas cowboys game i can tell you oh how big is that fucking screw dude it is  the most ridiculous fucking thing i've ever been to i literally felt like i could ride out the 
[02:16:00]  apocalypse in this place it is the biggest structure i've ever been in it's it's un-fucking  we were coming up over the hill and i thought i was seeing the whole thing and it was just the roof  and i was just like oh you know it's not that big and then when i saw it dude i literally i said  holy shit like 20 times in a row it's ridiculous how many people five five decks of people is there  a hundred thousand yeah when they get people standing it was hilarious because they put 
[02:16:30]  105 000 people in there but if you once you stand four deep you can't see shit no and then there was  a big time uh fire hazard there so the firemen weren't letting people in and all the texas were  like i pay my fucking money and then in the irony of all ironies they're throwing water bottles at  the firemen oh god i want to burn to death man that is ironic that is a futuristic looking fucking  stadium i'm gonna tell you that tv screen is the most unbelievable thing i've ever fucking seen you  have to it's so clear it makes look it makes the game look like it's fake and you have to you have to 
[02:17:00]  fight we had great take we're sitting on the 40 yard line watch the screen i had to fight myself  not to sit up there and look at it that it was unbelievable then they had like these go-go  dancers yeah dancing at the top of the station stadium which is basically the height of like  a low-flying private aircraft way up at the top dude there was so much shit going on and the pa  announcer was so loud every stop at your play you know they're just trying to pay this thing off to  be like ladies and gentlemen please direct your attention to the screen for the fedex blah blah 
[02:17:30]  moment ladies and gentlemen they had screen within screen they would do a replay and  that that huge screen would have four different shots the one-on-one of the receiver tony romo  dropping back it was it was it was almost too much that's awesome i was talking about that though at  yankee stadium like with the same thing the advertising everything oh yeah just you know right  and now the uh call to the bullpen sponsored by at&t it's the at&t call to the bullpen 
[02:18:00]  and everything yeah the fudrucker nut adjustment it's like every five seconds they're trying to  make like more money yeah and dude i gotta tell you you know what's great about it is is it's so  dallas texas where it's so new money the way they've done it it is most tackiest it's literally like  some white trash dude hit the lottery and he gets the gold plate like real gold faucet fixtures  it is a great investment stupid i like this that's fucking awesome i like it shiny you see any  puns hit the hit the tv there no when you sit on the lower level it all everything looks like it's 
[02:18:30]  going to hit it people like oh my god it was like to the side of it it's like no we're below it  yeah you get no real perspective they're saying that they're they're hitting it though they got  to raise it up i don't do it all i know is that it that what else does the stadium have it's seven  stories high my building in new york is six stories and they and the big thing is then they always  have to have the comparison that you can relate to yeah you can take the statue of liberty lay it down  on its side ain't gonna fucking touch either side that's how fucking big it is everything's big 
[02:19:00]  down here and that was a funny thing they got this huge stadium but at the end of the day they're  they're all still cowboys i don't even mean it in a bad way but he didn't have to spend all that  money this guy in front of me he was wearing a suit in his defense but he was dipping he's got  like yeah he's he's got the chew in his mouth yeah let me kill you boy yeah spitting into a  fucking cup here's a wildcat offense that is i wish there was some scale to that like there's  there's no way there's no you have to go to it yeah yeah you have to experience there's no way 
[02:19:30]  to describe it and that that screen as big as it is does not look huge when you're there in a weird  way because it's proportionate the state how big the giant places yeah it's like nuclear winter and  you found the ultimate shelter like you just feel like it's the end of the world out there that's  some sick shit what else does the stadium have that's different oh well we got we got the biggest  fucking pro shop it's like 17 stories dude i walked in there was like walking in the apple store like  on free ipod day i got in like there for like a minute and a half free fuck this and i was just 
[02:20:00]  like i gotta get out of here i gotta get yeah i was like claustrophobic wow man that is yeah i i got  i gotta see that hey uh deadspin.com has a video of two people fucking in the new stadium thanks to  balls in virginia beach hey uh bill very early this morning stadium's awesome very very early  this morning we said you were coming in playing the stress factor this weekend let's make sure we  get the plugs out for vinny uh great place to see comedy and someone said that they saw you in  sweden oh yeah they thought you were coming in early so they were on the line we never got to 
[02:20:30]  them but said that you were how did you get to sweden uh they just called me up and they they  you know american comics are doing well over there do the internet is it's ridiculous like  and um wow so they're starting to like american comedians so yeah they called me up they asked  me if i wanted to go and it's like yeah i want me to go to kansas city again fuck yeah i'll go how  was sweden dude it was on first of all dude the joke i was opening with was you know i got this is  what i was opening with so i was like hey what's up everybody you know i gotta go with hitler on this 
[02:21:00]  one you guys are some good-looking sons of bitches oh shit it's just everyone good-looking dude it was  ridiculous it's not like everyone is but the ratio of good-looking people stockholm swedium was  like soho to the 10th power i was walking down the street with my girl even like guys i'm going  look at that guy look at that guy that's ridiculous and then they'd be like working a newsstand it's  like come to america dude you'd have your own reality show even if you're a fucking moron 
[02:21:30]  like there was some of the most beautiful people ever but but then once we got outside the city we took  the subway or like the underground as they call it underground underground and we got outside the  city then that's kind of where they they're uglier people are you know it's kind of like yeah you go  out to jersey or maybe they push them to the uh outskirts and yeah then you find your vinnie brand  your bill burrs i've never felt like genetically compromised what when i when i went there i was  just like god damn man dude i am a fucking mongrel i would literally be like sweeping up elephant 
[02:22:00]  shit over here did did any what joke uh didn't translate a joke in that does very well everywhere  else this well this is what i did i was i was smart enough luckily i got in like a day or two early  and i went up at a club so i could get over that whole thing because they're ridiculously bilingual  but it still gets in your head i mean i was i went on at this comedy club over there the golden  circle comedy club or some shit like that jesus christ could jimmy do 20 minutes on that name  but um there was literally like the three comedians in front of me were just totally like you know 
[02:22:30]  and they're killing they're killing and i'm standing in the back of the room going oh my god  they don't know english i flew 17 hours to eat my balls and they were just  it was hilarious i couldn't understand what they were saying but you could tell  who was a good comedian who was a hack just by their body stuff and like there was one you could  tell like this stephen wright sort of like uh guy where he would just be like  so i basically the first night i went up there i was i was on my heels because i knew i was going 
[02:23:00]  to be it was just too fucking weird and there was there was like you know just certain like uh  there's certain reality shows that that are actually american shows that are on over there  like that's all you go over there you watch some tv to try to get how much of what i'm saying do they 
[02:23:30]  get but you know a little like i made a kickball reference they didn't get that i had to turn it  to soccer but but generally speaking they you know they they i mean believe me the stuff people  were saying to me at the end of the show was totally different i usually get you know dude you're  funny as shit let's let's do a shot that's what you're getting over there the summer lady came up to me  she was going like yeah i have a question you guys are a capitalistic country why do you take  loans from a communist country and i'm just yeah i didn't i was like corrupt right i don't know why 
[02:24:00]  do you still have a king and queen i bet it was i'm telling you dude it was one of the uh coolest  experiences and when i went out there you know because i do this podcast every uh every monday not  to whore myself out here billburr.com right yeah but these people like uh so i came walking out and  like it was a theater like 700 cedar i was able to fill like half of it which i was really happy  with and i walked down there's like six people standing up because i didn't think i was going  to because you know i get emails because you're ever going to come over here and uh i'm in the 
[02:24:30]  middle of my act i'm on the other side of the fucking world and i just go like uh i go yes you  know you know my life's you know settling down i go i got a dog recently and somebody in the back  goes cleo like yelled out the name of my dog and i was just like wow that is that's weird  the power of the internet this is fucking insane you guys if you went over there you'd have i like  one of the funniest like non-heckles ever just that voice and i'm not even exaggerating like i  was sitting there going you know towards the end of the show i'm like you know what's what's there 
[02:25:00]  to do here well where should i go and blah blah blah and this guy in the crowd yells out he goes  come to my house they'll have a party  dude i melt that for a half hour that's another thing i did because you know some of my american  jokes weren't working and whenever that whenever the jokes weren't working i would just throw in  come to my house we'll have a party i was just doing like get her done that was my get her done  i just kept saying it over and over again and uh we're getting a request well let's let's get 
[02:25:30]  ready on the line i don't know we'll see if this leads to something randy in virginia  yeah i was wondering if we could hear some uh swedish dice clay  oh  uh  uh  uh  uh  uh  uh 
[02:26:00]  people say in your podcast very funny bill  i very rarely hype it what about the food and the beer i was talking to roland he was over there  recently and he said the the beer is really strong yeah the beer was food sucks  the food was yeah i think they're into what did he tell me fridays or something  like fridays is a huge restaurant for for the suites it's a tgi friday is like a restaurant 
[02:26:30]  slash nightclub like it's this fucking cool place to go to  yeah exactly  and they got like these  what the  fuck i want some poppers  yeah and they got like  they got like lounge chairs like really like uh  yeah it looks like you know it looks like the date rate drug is routinely dropped in there  are they just smoking all the time too is it a lot of smoking yeah it was i don't know  it was it was well first of all they they didn't they didn't fuck with hitler during world 
[02:27:00]  war ii so most of their old buildings are still standing still there they didn't have to deal with  siebritz krig yeah they try to act like they were neutral but when i brought that up to them  they all kind of laughed and rolled their eyes yeah yeah we were neutral oh yeah  dude he used to fucking be across whatever that sea they're jerking off to him some shenanigans  were going on yeah that's awesome listen we got to take a break because uh david dacovny just  arrived okay promoting uh californication and i believe he took a trip across america we want  to ask him about that and other things a friend of ours he actually requested to do our show that's 
[02:27:30]  pretty cool but i think some of that is all bullshit well you know i did the tonight show he was  actually uh one of the guests on there yeah and actually my my tonight show stuff started off a  little bit rough probably because i said that's what you get you dumb bitch that was my first punch  line oh which is probably stupid so i went to the couch i said that i'd go yeah okay i felt like i was  eating my balls up front he goes yeah you know you kind of were but you know you pulled it out

[02:35:00]  it was uh and then after that it's usually just when it starts airing and you and they look at the  numbers and they in cable they can do that you know they they wait because there's such a lag time  between finishing the show and airing it so you're you're in limbo a lot but we feel pretty good about  what we're doing better than uh like network though where they can just cut your throat in a second  yeah well they they will cancel you and and not air shows that that you've already yeah that you've  done and then and then you go to work one day and this hasn't happened to me but you go to work  and everybody's sad and you read it's been canceled yeah there's just a jingle on tv wednesdays are a 
[02:35:30]  changing on abc and you're like that's what my show was on what happened that's some stupid little  jingle and your dream is at least canceled me before i went through hair and makeup  now i'm orange for the rest of the day and i don't even have a job you uh you lucked out with  californication because a lot of times did you did you think like oh shit i'm gonna be typecast uh 
[02:36:00]  yeah well i mean i didn't really think that but i but apparently a lot of people did and uh i never  i never really thought i thought you know something i'll find something i'll do something i'm an actor  i'll i'll find stuff to do and when californication came around it was it was really just the comedy  that i wanted to do it wasn't so much a character but just like uh the type of comedy that i wanted to  do and i didn't see out there yeah you were doing movies after uh the x files that were like  different obviously different character none of them really hit and that's just hit or miss and 
[02:36:30]  then you know you just keep swinging but the the thing is it's it's kind of it's almost better to do  a different character and have it not really hit then kind of here look it's yeah yeah molder doing  this and you know playing mentally challenged yeah there you go yeah like how many how many  scripts that had aliens in it have you just keep getting those scripts that or just some kind of 
[02:37:00]  fbi agent yeah yeah i know i look good in this suit yeah like just stop you already have the  credentials yeah he already has a badge let's hire him we'll save on prop money is there a kind of  role that you're still waiting to like play because uh i always thought it would be cool if  you got to do that that episode the guest star on a cop show where they chase you down the alley  and you get to that chain link fence and you're climbing up they just grab you that scene and then  you get to do the entire yeah you're the snitch come on man don't talk to me out here man people 
[02:37:30]  are gonna see stuff i would love to be that guy is there like a role if you've gotten at this point  in your career have you gotten to do like every sort of like uh uh sort of thing you wanted to do i  i think so i mean i i i write and i direct so i i guess i'm interested in doing my own stuff but  i never i i'd like to be the guy on the chain link fence sure that sounds like a fun thing i always  like when the cop shows i always like that uh all they have to do is really yell at you loud and you 
[02:38:00]  confess yeah you know they get in your face and they spit a little bit and all of a sudden  it's like a riot yes i killed her it was let's get on with the prison rape already  minnie you got something i just like you know what i like the show a lot i mean where the  where the guy they can't solve a crime for four years and the guy oh you just picked your nose  you're guilty oh i am guilty and he just confesses i'd like to be that guy that just  breaks down immediately well there's the uh the the real show like uh first 48 you ever watch that 
[02:38:30]  first 48 hours of uh a crime and um you would think that would be school for criminals what not  to do right because they walk in there and when you see the cops go into the interrogation room and  one of the uh the the perp goes you know i want to talk to a lawyer they go all right they pick up  their stuff they leave the office shut the door and then you see them go god damn it like if the  cop's mad that's what you do now obviously lawyer up but then there's people like 
[02:39:00]  all right yeah the gun went off i don't know what happened but i didn't mean it you know me  well i shot 10 times in the head yeah and then 20 minutes later when they're telling the story for  the fifth time yeah like i was reloading it my adrenaline was going i was thinking how great  this was gonna feel when i shot this person in the face it's like lawyer up immediately immediately  and uh it really annoys the cops that's what i've learned from that program it's fantastic though  like those reality did you spend your summer uh going cross country there david yeah we took a  rock and roll bus uh like the partridge family really like a tour bus yeah we had bunks and stuff 
[02:39:30]  we had 12 bunks bunk alley the insiders call it and uh yeah yeah we we had a real rock and roll bus driver  and uh we took a lot of pride in that uh we we probably drove it more crazy than any band ever  did wow we are tougher than metallica really as a family of four but we went we went across country  went to the grand canyon and uh niagara falls and we went through texas and missouri and it was it 
[02:40:00]  caught all those uh did you go to all those little sightseeing places yeah we did i'd never seen the  grand canyon or niagara falls so that was that was nice for me and the kids the grand canyon is just  ridiculous looks just like the pictures doesn't it yeah you can't describe it to anyone well i mean  the pictures don't do it justice i just say it looks just like the picture 3d no it is it is an  amazing it's unbelievable majestic sublime sight and uh the kids it was totally lost on my kids you  know there was it's hot it's hot here it's hot yeah all right let's go bowling how old are the kids 
[02:40:30]  i'm itchy ten and seven ten and seven yeah they don't get the the scope of it they just look at  at the hole in the ground where are the rides yeah is there a ride here can i take one of the  ponies down it's true yeah they don't want to do that and then you're just so disappointed in your  offspring yeah what is wrong with you when they get older it gets worse don't worry you're in the  you're in the fun stage it's just a shit sandwich after a while yeah vinnie's in hell yeah i'm in 
[02:41:00]  absolute hell how old are your kids i have a lot of them 24 23 oh 20 you have a 24 what did you have when  were you 13 to i kids when i was just a kid i was only 22 i had my first kid so lord and i got a  nine-year-old and a six-year-old those are the good ages nine and six stop already i am you know  what's weird i'd have one more because i keep thinking well one of them's going to turn out  good if i just keep going keep pushing the odds yeah play the odds man it's like gotta be one kid  that doesn't want to fuck my mind over i always i always thought it'd be great if we were like insects 
[02:41:30]  where you had a thousand nine hundred fifty were eaten by birds but then you had 50 right yeah  those 50 little ones that make it to the ocean and the little turtles you're only with them for two  days take the pictures and move on get out of this mess how how hard is that to like uh travel around  the country though because obviously you're pretty recognizable recognizable but you know wearing the  hat and the glasses and moving fast and that kind of stuff yeah is that what you do yeah and that works 
[02:42:00]  pretty well uh what sometimes you want to be recognized because you want you want stuff  faster than other people yeah when you want free shit free stuff are you gonna make me pay for  breakfast look at who i am do you uh that's when he pretends he's hot and takes the hat off  david duchovny's a little warm here yeah everyone around him says his whole name david duchovny are you  really hot right now why yes yes i am i make i make the kids call me david duchovny  i was at the uh at the uh at the arch in in st louis it was endless endless lines lines it's one of 
[02:42:30]  those places where you line up to line up and then you line up what is the art you just go up in the  arch that's it well we didn't know because they make it line up for so long we thought it's got to  be great but it's got to be something good here it's a little claustrophobic and my wife's a little  claustrophobic get up into the arch and it's it's actually beautiful from the outside i found right  from the inside it's like being on the 18th floor of a building it's exactly that yeah yeah but it 
[02:43:00]  but it sways though yeah it's designed building yeah it's designed first first of all you go up in  those little they still have those little morgue eggs yes exactly go up in and it's it's you sort  of just go kind of going side to side and every time you feel like you're just going to go right  down an elevator shaft jesus and you get up to top to look out the window you literally have to lay  down yeah and the structure is moving it was a windy day too when we were all right so that sounds like  fun well it's a truly beautiful structure it's it's it's kind of surreal and beautiful but uh  i was trying to work some kind of recognition scheme there but it didn't work really i mean yeah it 
[02:43:30]  worked but i didn't get any love i mean i didn't get i didn't get to jump the line and and tay  and i are saying well you know the kids have to realize that life is like this you do have to wait  in lines i said yeah between the two of you jesus christ really up there in a second what what is the  move you do when you when you uh what's your best like i don't want to get recognized move like you  see a pack of people you mean i want to get recognized don't want to get recognized do you  just do the uh hat head down yeah i kind of turn and look away uh but uh sometimes my ass gets 
[02:44:00]  recognized yeah it's been photographed a lot but uh it happened i i i said this on uh on the i guess  was fallon the other day i was i was standing on a corner and i was waiting for tay to pick me up on  our on our on our on our motorcycle vespa yeah you have a vespa it's not actually a vespa but it's  it's similar it ain't a motorcycle and uh she was late and i was standing on the corner of midtown  and it was i was being recognized and then this van pulled over and he was talking to the back of 
[02:44:30]  my head he was and i was and he was like david david i just i didn't want it so i looked away  and he was like david david no i wasn't i wasn't going to be recognized and then he he pulls  around the corner he goes david your show sucks if you had just said hello i wouldn't have been a  fan exactly you cock that's exactly what it was you couldn't just say hi i was like well your van is  yeah he's a tune-up i got nothing you do that uh where you've been made you ever you ever do that 
[02:45:00]  like you you turn your head and go oh yeah there it is there it is a lot of times like i like whoever  i'm with at the time if i'm with a girlfriend or something like that they're like i go just been  made yeah they go what do you mean i go no the guy's in the corner there absolutely not who i am  they're gonna come over they're gonna and they look because you can see they look at you and they  their eyes get all weird and then they turn to their friends and say something and they all start  like turning and looking yeah you know like yeah i'm sure i'm i'm trying to relate what i go through 
[02:45:30]  to david do coffee by the way it's just uh i understand it david uh me and you oh yeah i'm  right with you movie tv fame radio you know where they hear my voice i clear my throat before my  spaghetti it's over the whole room's just like that's anthony you ever get moved right to the  back of a line get out of here the worst one was uh i was in chicago years ago i was doing a  movie in chicago and i got it was staying in a a tall hotel with a long elevator out and i got in 
[02:46:00]  at some terrible hour 4 30 in the morning going to work and this middle-aged couple was was there  and they were exchanging glances and i knew it was coming and i didn't want it it was 4 30 in the  morning and finally the uh the guy goes good morning doctor and uh and uh and i said uh i said wrong  show and i was like and i guess he thought i was uh at the point at that point i thought he thought

[02:47:00]  the time i'm not him i have denied myself yeah you do that of judas action i feel like wow you look  just like i feel like an ass when i do that i really do it just never works for me yeah because  you're a very specific look too you're not an easy thank you yeah there's not a lot of guys gonna  you're walking around looking exactly like that yeah who's that half two half scott  that guy just tell him you drive a truck  no i drive a truck i always say you know that guy's like four foot tall 
[02:47:30]  every time he walks to the girl she's in a trench it's hysterical  the company now he's like three foot eight yeah i heard that guy's a dick  he wouldn't even look at me he can't i was in a van hey that guy sucks then you should tell  david what he could look forward to as far as his kids go what's the oldest boy or girl uh girl  that's miserable right around uh she's how old ten ten you got two good years left and the wheels  will fall off and it'll be non-stop misery everything will be fucking drama there's never 
[02:48:00]  a yeah that was good i took my daughter to see springsteen the other night yeah so we're 14th  row at springsteen what could go wrong in the springsteen concert nothing 24 some girl behind  her smacks her in the head next to you know a fucking full fist fight breaks out during born  to run i'm like are you fucking kidding me and so i turned around to try and calm it down and this  other father who's maybe 50 years old fat guy with glasses if you're listening sir i would have  fucking mauled you i would have mauled you had you gotten through that fat fuck in front of you 
[02:48:30]  so mad oh don't you get pissed off when someone's at your kids right oh yeah it's the worst so he  comes at me and i'm like are you fucking kidding me but my wife who's 104 pounds is separating me and  she's yelling at me like i'm the bad guy i'm just trying to to dance like a white guy at a springsteen  concert and i got my daughter who can't take a simple smack in the back of the head probably an  accident probably a moment where someone got excited no that's just fucking all drama it out 
[02:49:00]  it's a fight and then my then my 20 year old who's with us also looks at me and goes i'm calling  security on you i'm like how the fuck am i the bad guy that's kind of sounds like fun getting into a  big fight yeah it's not a springsteen family bonding moment of nice actually what you're saying  is you should have been at the giants game yeah no the jets game the giants fans were okay it's  the jets game where you wanted to beat the shit out of people and is the son still smoking pot  no you know he's doing stand-up comedy one of my favorite stories ever where 
[02:49:30]  he called uh the police on his own son who was smoking pot in the house and then at the  and then in the end it became a big problem for him because he had to pay for the lawyer for  cost me fifty four hundred dollars you are an ass it's one of the great stories you know  you know i forgot about that story i never told you i bailed him out can you give david like you  don't have to get way involved but just give him the basics had you spoken to him before this is the  first time you ever smoked pot in the house and you called the cops well he was laying on his bed 
[02:50:00]  at four o'clock in the afternoon i'm changing an infant in the next room and he's smoking dope and  we live on a big piece of property any normal kid would have said you know what i'll just go walk  out behind that weed he won't even know he's just laying on your fucking bed smoking dope and  so you you you took issue with the placement of the smoking pot yeah more than anything else  definitely yes i mean how fucking lazy are you so he wasn't i'm changing an infant he's doing lines  on the other end of the table come on all right we do it in the kitchen  like my father taught me go outside to smoke 
[02:50:30]  show some respect yeah and he also he also had already dropped out of school so you know he  dropped out of school he's smoking dope he's not going anywhere and uh it's like got the  cop right and then i had to bail him out and then hire a lawyer and and beat the case but here's what  i never told you you beat the case yeah you testified against yourself i was the only exactly  what happened i wouldn't testify and they're like well there's no witness now and i'm like i can't  feel believe this cost me five grand to sit here and go i know i'm not going up there i don't 
[02:51:00]  require anything they got me on tape he's smoking pot come get him not like i could deny my voice  yeah exactly that was matt roloff it wasn't me midget voice so so then uh here's what happened  after i bailed him out and the case got dismissed your bail money gets released to you you get to go  get that so he's the same name as me i hope you didn't name your kid david no all right smart move  so so i go to get my bail money and i and they go oh you already signed for your money you applied 
[02:51:30]  it to your tickets and i'm like i don't have tickets i don't have any tickets and i go yeah it's right  here and that little jerk off had had tickets that he hadn't paid and used the fucking bail money  to pay the tickets the same name i think that shows a lot of ingenuity yeah yeah that is really  clever yeah i didn't i didn't say he wasn't smart i said he's annoying this could be this could be a  storyline for californication i'm thinking well you want to start with the smoking pot thing that  could work first episode i find my daughter yeah you ever think what yeah no i'm telling uh 
[02:52:00]  uh you ever think he's like a better dad maybe and maybe all these stories you're a bad dad no  he doesn't know yet they're only 10 you have no fucking clue at 10 years old you still think  shit is good and you think that's the truth but they're already turning on you vinnie what's that  they're already turning on you at 10 you jumped in to save your daughter and your son tried to call  security on you no no my my 20 year old tried my son didn't go to the concert i bought him a ticket 
[02:52:30]  and he didn't go he didn't want to go so basically once your child can start actually  thinking and observing behavior that's when they start turning on you exactly right when they start  having a mind of their own that's when it just it's miserable because you anything you say do your  homework i don't do my homework and they just an argument it's a fucking non-stop battle if you said  breathe air i'm not breathing today they realize at one point that you can't actually force them to do  anything yeah because when they're young they feel like you can force them are you you're not a 
[02:53:00]  yeller right you never yell no uh i'll get annoyed but i haven't no not sustained yelling maybe like a  short barked syllable i'll bark occasionally the best move just look at them and shake your head no  because it makes them think and you just and walk away it took me a long time to learn that  david's a grappler he takes it to the ground just chokes him out he doesn't he doesn't do a lot of talk  i did have my son in a full nelson yesterday actually really yeah but it was mostly in play  i think mostly i think just a little reminder a little reminder of who's boss a little pack leader 
[02:53:30]  alpha male stuff daddy you're starting to hurt oh i didn't mean that i just put the full weight on  him like a dog does yeah yeah there it is i still run this joint yeah nip at his ears a little bit  we got one of david the company's biggest fans that work uh for the show we're all fans but we  got one of your biggest fans mars mars is freaking out that david is here today yeah and but he can't  say your name which the first or the second well yeah that would be i can't say david sam's getting

You guys were talking music over there, Bill?  Yeah, just drums. I was just saying  if you want to learn how to play  an instrument, all you got to do is just go onto YouTube  and literally, whatever,  basically, whatever, if you have  guitar song you want to learn how to play,  you just type in the song and you just write 
[03:04:30]  guitar lesson  and you'll find some creep out there  that will show you how to play it.  Some creep?  Oh, they're all creeps.  And then everybody says,  you're playing it wrong.  This guy sucks.  Epic fail.  And all that dumb shit.  It's fucking enough.  And then they never have the balls  to put a video up themselves.  What is epic fail?  Oh, you don't know the epic fail?  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of those things when somebody,  like, whatever, just fails at doing something.  It's an epic?  I guess somebody wrote it the first time  and then everybody has the exact same criticism. 
[03:05:00]  There's a whole site.  There's a whole website.  The guy has a site for just fail.  Fail.com.  They're hysterical.  Failblog.org?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, you basically,  they got this website,  like, failblog.something or other.  It's all people just fucking up.  Failing.  Failing at whatever, right.  Drinking glass of water.  Fail.  You know?  He, like, cuts his mouth open.  It's like every fucking thing  you could possibly fail at.  5,000 shots of guys get hit in the nuts.  That was great.  I was writing a check 
[03:05:30]  and the pen tap hit me in the balls.  It's vicious.  Yeah, but that's funny every time, though.  Check writing fail.  It is.  Ball shots are funny every time.  Yeah, that was that joke.  That's a joke that bombed  when I did the Tonight Show.  The first one I opened with  was talking about watching people  eating poisonous,  getting bit by poisonous snakes.  And that was the punchline.  Ah, that's what you get,  you dumb bitch.  And everybody's looking at me like,  I'm a maniac.  You're mean.  Yeah.  Black comedian's mean.  This is the Jay Leno show.  Why is he so mean?  No, people getting attacked by animals.  He should do Kimmel. 
[03:06:00]  People getting attacked by animals  is the greatest way  to truly understand their power  because a lion attacks another lion.  It's even.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see what if I walked in there.  You ever seen the moose  trample the guy to death  in front of, like, 20 people?  There's a moose trapped in a fence.  So everybody's outside the fence.  Let's watch the moose.  It's inside this little corral,  however I got in there.  And just one guy,  I got to go closer to the moose.  Dr. Doolittle.  And he knocks him over.  Dr. Doolittle, yeah.  And he just fucking stomps on him  until he's dead.  And everyone's got their cell phones  out there doing this. 
[03:06:30]  And now it's on YouTube.  Of course you do that.  Moose rescue epic fail.  Like, that's basically how it works.  He thought it was Bullwinkle.  Yeah, that's what they do.  They get this misconception  that these animals are friendly  for some reason.  They can walk up to them.  Yeah.  And one of the best ones  I ever saw was a woman,  I guess it was in Russia,  where they just treat bears horribly.  Make them ride the bicycle.  I don't want to do this.  Their paws are nailed  to the fucking pelvis.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they put a muzzle  on this one, thank God, 
[03:07:00]  because this woman  is sitting next to this bear  and she looks at it  and the bear kind of looks at her  and just grabs her  and like belts her  three times in the face.  She falls over  and you can just see  the strength of this thing.  Oh, yeah.  And if it didn't have the muzzle on,  dead.  Yeah.  Epic bear pet fail.  You ever see the lion  eat the father?  What?  Yeah, you go on.  This is an easy one  to find on YouTube.  There's a family.  Just type in lion eat father.  Yeah, for sure.  It's all there. 
[03:07:30]  There it is.  Lion father fail.  And you can learn  how to play it on guitar, too.  That's a new song, yeah.  That's a great one.  The lion, he gets out  to take a picture of a lion.  They're in a car.  They're on a safari.  And when he gets out,  this female lion  just walks up behind him,  gentle as can be.  She pushes them down  on the ground  and then they all just eat them  and the family's in the car.  Cannot be real.  It's real.  Everybody says that one's fake.  Yeah, that's a fake one.  Who says it's fake?  Everybody.  Pull it up and watch it.  Fake, fake, totally fake. 
[03:08:00]  I love that.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  You're a dick, totally fake.  You can see the edit.  Yeah.  That's good.  You pay attention  to any of the critics  on the internet?  No, no, no.  Because it's hard  to not remember  awful things  that people say.  Yeah.  It's easy to forget  nice things.  Very good point.  So I try and stay away.  Sometimes it's not possible,  but I do.  I've been in battles  with people that... 
[03:08:30]  And then I go,  why am I doing this?  Why are you wasting time?  Why am I doing this?  Because I just think  whoever...  The worst somebody will say...  Some voice inside me  will say,  you know, they're right.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Yeah.  You have to know.  They figured it out.  It doesn't matter.  Damn it, they're on to me.  It doesn't matter what you do.  Someone's going to find  a problem.  You'd cure cancer  and stuff.  That's the fucking  worst cure for cancer ever.  Fucking jerk off.  Anyone could have done that.  Anyone with a typewriter  can weigh in now.  That's the problem.  Cure, fail. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  With a typewriter?  How old are you?  How old are you?  What the fuck?  Everyone with a typewriter.  Joke, fail.  And then my 50-year-old kid.  Joke, epic, fail.  Vinny typewriter, fail.  Yeah, anonymity is a problem.  And you were killing, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But people don't have  to be responsible  for looking you in the eye  and saying something.  Yeah, you used to.  Because that's a real human thing.  And when you're not doing that,  you can just hide  under the cover of darkness  or internet?  Always complain about that.  It's like there's  no accountability.  People can say  whatever they want.  I think a lot of people 
[03:09:30]  get facts from the internet  just because it's written  and it's typed  and it's a nice font  and it has maybe  a sporty-looking website.  And then you're like,  oh, it's got to be true.  My son, years ago,  the internet just comes out  and he's doing  a homework assignment  and he has to do  a report on lions  and he's got a picture  of a tiger  on this fucking report.  I go, Vinny,  that's a tiger.  And he goes,  no, no, I got that  off the internet.  That's a lion.  I got that from lion.com.  I'm like,  you fucking jerk off. 
[03:10:00]  That's a tiger.  It was under not a lion.  This is what he said to me.  I'm not making this up.  I go, Vinny,  does it look like a tiger?  He goes, yeah,  but these people on the internet  are a lot smarter  than me and you.  That's why he's smoking pot.  Report fail.  But, you know,  somebody writes something  in a blog  and the news  will even pick it up sometimes  and it's totally fake.  It's false.  And then they got a,  we're sorry,  we were misled  and stupid.  We Googled that.  You can't put it  back in the bottle. 
[03:10:30]  No, no.  A lot of times  a rumor will just get out  like that.  Some people go on there  and they're just trying to,  when somebody just like  totally loves somebody  or loves a video,  it is funny  to write something  bad about it.  Oh my God,  that puppy is so cute.  I hope he gets rabies.  That is so mean.  And then you can just  get him going.  It's like you're bored.  You just want to piss people off.  It's fun to do.  Yeah.  It's like the prank call  of now.  And people want to read  the bad shit.  They don't want to read  the good shit.  They want to read 
[03:11:00]  that one comment  that says 500 good things  and that sucked  and that's what they read.  Had it so many times  though where,  you know,  we used to,  there used to be  so many message boards  about this show  and stuff that,  and then we just stopped  acknowledging them  for a while.  Still go to a few of them  and stuff and I think  they've settled down  a lot more  than they used to.  But it was just,  you'd get on there  and they'd be,  you'd feel good  about what you did  that day.  And then you'd just  be like,  you read one post  and it's like,  you know,  they used to be  so much better  back when they did this 
[03:11:30]  and, you know,  Anthony used to do this  and then list like  these imitations  I used to do  of everyone  that's dead now.  It's like,  sorry,  I can't help it  that every imitation  I was able to do  in my life,  they're all dead now.  His Monica Lewinsky  was amazing.  Yeah, yeah,  so what am I gonna do?  Sorry,  I can't go,  well, yes.  Sorry,  Reagan's dead.  Now it's like  on his birthday  when a Nancy Reagan  story comes up  then I can pull Reagan out.  I'm gonna work  on your Obama impression.  Yeah,  I think I've been doing that.  He's got a kind of 
[03:12:00]  staccato,  like cadence  to a speech.  Let me hear that.  I'm not ready for it yet.  Not ready for it yet,  David.  Not ready for it yet,  David.  David Dukakny.  I apologize.  He was so nervous.  Mars couldn't take  being in the same room.  I'm gonna bring him back in.  He was freaking out.  Didn't he?  Yeah.  Didn't he make you,  like, yeah.  I thought he was gonna  take a swing at me  or something.  He would.  He's a martial artist.  I saw that.  I saw that on his t-shirt.  That's how you know.  You know by reading  the t-shirt.  You know that he's  at least a yellow belt.  Yeah, there's something 
[03:12:30]  about his build  and his haircut.  You can tell he's  not just a fan.  Yeah.  Like, if I put on  a UFC,  they'd be like,  oh, he likes it.  He pays for the pay-per-view.  Do you do anything,  like, as far as  protection,  fighting,  things like that?  I boxed for a while.  Did you?  I haven't done it  for a while  because I screwed up  my hand,  but I actually had  a couple of fights,  you know,  with gloves on.  Really?  Shit.  Yeah.  Did you win?  That's a nasty sport.  I think I was 0-1-1.  Yeah?  I don't like 
[03:13:00]  getting punched.  It hurts.  It makes you feel silly.  Yeah, but we're  going to do this  for fun.  It's a sport.  I'm like the thinking  man's boxer,  which means, like,  I get hit and I think,  what am I doing?  Yeah, why am I in here?  I don't need to do this.  I'm thinking too much  in here.  I'm thinking,  I'm thinking,  I'm thinking I shouldn't  be in here.  And it's funny,  it's a sport,  well, I think like  most sports,  they're very hard  to take up  when you're older.  If you didn't do it  as a kid,  especially these  instinctual games, 
[03:13:30]  which most sports are,  and boxing is just,  it's a lot like dancing  except you're getting hit  while you're doing it.  Except your partner's  really mad at you.  It's still how I dance.  That's the way  I used to think of it.  It's like,  here we are dancing  and occasionally  we're going to try  and hit one another.  And you just never,  you never stop thinking  when you take it up old.  You never stop thinking  left, right,  left, right,  left, right.  And you just never  get that good.  After all that beat up  that you do the whole  hug,  good match. 
[03:14:00]  There's a lot of love  after that  because the truth is  you can't actually  have a fight  unless somebody agrees  to fight you.  So you have respect  and gratitude  for that person  for giving you  the chance to get hit.  Great.  I didn't hug anybody  at Springsteen.  Somebody gave me  great advice.  I did that for a minute.  You're just like,  look at these boxes.  They're shredded.  I'm going to go to  Gleason's Gym  and start boxing.  And Charlie Murphy,  I told him I was going  down there to do it  and he goes,  well, listen,  he goes,  if somebody tells you, 
[03:14:30]  he goes,  they're going to try  to get you in the ring  because they need  fresh meat down there.  He goes,  I'm telling you,  I'm telling you,  it's like he was like  saw the future.  He goes,  you're going to be there  for about three weeks  and somebody's going to,  he's like,  yo,  someone's going to come up  and this shredded black dude's like,  yeah, man,  you got some skills.  You do comedy?  You'd never know that.  You should get in the ring.  He just needs to practice  some shit  that he's not ready  to do in a pro yet.  So I'm not going to be able  to block it.  Like,  what happens if I do this? 
[03:15:00]  He'd look at you  and you'd start bleeding,  by the way.  You look like a bleeder.  All this Irish guys.  You would just cut so easy.  But you never quit  because you can't do  anything for yourself.  You're still coming.  Don't steal what you're  stopping for.  Fucking nose is over  by your ear.  You ever see those fights  with that real Irish guy  and a black guy  and the Irish guy  is just a bloody,  covered in blood.  Bit of a bleeder.  Oh, Tex Cobb.  And the black guy  looks like Chuck Webner, right?  Fresh out of the locker room.  Old school boxer,  Chuck Webner?  Chuck Webner, 
[03:15:30]  I remember.  Tex Cobb.  A bleeder.  White guys look so much worse  when they bleed.  Jerry Quarry would never quit.  Jerry Quarry, Jesus.  Jerry Quarry was a great fighter.  He was, yeah.  But he just had the problem  of when he came up,  there were so many great guys.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  He had to fight.  He was also a little small.  He was like a light heavyweight  and he was fighting.  What about Jerry Cooney?  Cooney had skills.  Looney Cooney.  From Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  Peter McNeely?  The Huntington boy.  Used to see him.  McNeely was an all-  Yeah, up in Massachusetts.  He used to do our radio show. 
[03:16:00]  Peter McNeely.  He fought Tyson.  He fought Tyson.  David just goes,  no.  Yeah.  No.  I mean, I could kick my ass  in 10 seconds.  But no.  He got to fight Tyson, though.  Come on.  Tyson in his prime.  You ever have to get into  any altercations, though?  Because, you know,  you and Tate walking around.  No, not in a long time.  Yeah?  No.  They leave you alone?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about paparazzi?  Yeah, yeah.  They're around.  Yeah?  Sure.  You fuck with them,  or are you just like,  eh, you let them do  what they're going to do?  Yeah, I guess you just  have to let them do it.  I suppose it's legal. 
[03:16:30]  But what they do now is,  when they have a video camera,  they'll ask really nasty things,  and then, you know,  then you're not,  I don't react,  but I guess then they can play it,  because the audio is them  asking really nasty things,  and that's amusing.  It kind of, yeah.  Well, it kind of makes them look.  Yeah, then your reaction to,  how much of that,  like, some of that stuff,  like, with, like,  the paparazzi,  how much of that is,  like, because you hear  sometimes stars tell them  where they're going to be,  like,  holy shit.  No, I'm just asking, 
[03:17:00]  just because, like,  there's, like,  some, like, super famous people,  like, you just,  you never see, like,  whatever, Steve Buscemi,  you never see him coming out  of a Starbucks wearing Uggs,  you know what I'm saying,  or whatever,  and it's just like,  it's like,  they're the paparazzi,  they're not the CIA.  I paid big money for that shot.  Yeah, I want to see that.  Yeah, but it's like,  they're the paparazzi,  they're not the CIA,  like, at what level do you get to  when then you can't,  you can't control it anymore?  You can never control it,  but it was funny,  because we were,  this summer,  we were in Malibu,  and we'd go to this beach  all the time, 
[03:17:30]  because I was shooting the show,  and I get uptight  when they take pictures  of my kids,  but there's, again,  there's nothing you can do,  and they published  some picture of me  and the surf  with Tay and the kids,  and it was a really nice picture,  and I was like,  let's get that one framed.  We're saving some money here  on family photographs.  That's our Christmas card.  Because normally,  one of us would have  to be holding the camera,  so hey,  we got a group shot here, 
[03:18:00]  we don't have many of those.  You don't tip them off,  though,  like,  if you're doing the show,  you let them know  you're shooting,  right?  They know you're going  to be shooting  on a location or whatever.  You mean on a location?  No,  that's public knowledge.  They can find out.  They can call  whatever the bureau is  that takes care of locations.  But you don't want  your publicist to call you,  to come get shot  from People Magazine?  No.  No?  Some of the stars do that,  though.  They have to.  They play along  with the paparazzi.  I tell people nonstop,  no one shows up.  We got the Peter McNeely  fight on the screen,  that's what I was reacting to. 
[03:18:30]  Oh,  my God.  He barely lasted  two minutes in there  with Tyson.  Yeah.  Yeah,  he got his ass down.  Minute 20,  I think.  It's coming up right here.  Watch what Tyson  does to McNeely.  Let's see this one.  Gave him a nice headbutt there.  Yeah,  watch what Tyson does.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  God,  those were the old days  with Tyson.  Oh,  good night.  Jesus,  don't get up.  Stay down,  Hurricane.  Look at him.  He got right back  at that though.  Yeah,  look at his eyes. 
[03:19:00]  Fail.  Boxing fail.  Epic.  Epic boxing fail.  Boxing fail.  Fail.  Yo,  that's a great ref right there.  He's just like,  no,  you're going to get killed.  Look at Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly's talking to the guy.  Dude,  you know,  man,  you lasted two minutes.  And you're done with the fight.  You get a cup of coffee.  Boom,  you're done.  Bob Kelly.  It kind of looks like him.  Jesus Christ.  We're in Vegas.  We're going to have a good time.  Dude.  Yeah,  that was in the,  God damn.  That was 95.  You didn't give a shit  that you paid for pay-per-view 
[03:19:30]  and knew  you weren't even getting  three minutes out of the pay-per-view.  You just wanted to see Tyson  come barreling out of a corner  and destroy somebody.  I gave a shit about that one.  That was a bad one to get.  Well,  that one was,  but you got it  or at least you went  to a friend's house  to watch it.  I got all of them.  I got the Michael Spinks one  where he punched his pancreas  and he hit him in the body  and the fight was over.  The problem with that,  I knew that fight was over  because Spinks showed up  with the tube socks  that I wore  in eighth grade basketball.  It's like,  he got those from Paragon. 
[03:20:00]  I know he did.  That's not good.  He's going to wear those home.  Home.  It's obvious  he's not going to get him sweaty.  Wow,  Muhammad Ali  was already a little slow.  1988,  they just showed him  in the ring with giant glasses  and a young Donald Trump  in the ring too.  I forget how long ago  this crap was.  1988?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  That's one of the best DVDs  you'll ever get  or a compilation  like the YouTube  is just the Tyson knockouts.  Check out Spinks' socks 
[03:20:30]  later on.  I'm telling you,  it's eighth grade basketball.  This is just  really amazing  how you can  mention something now  and then just watch it.  Yeah.  Years ago,  you were just fucked.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Mental picture,  mental picture,  mental picture.  Now it's like,  boom,  you pop it right up  on the screen.  That was the same  with movies  when they had to stay  out in the theater  to see it.  Movies?  Or remember back in the day,  if you missed a movie,  you missed it.  Maybe it'll come on  six years.  In five years, 
[03:21:00]  you might see it on TV.  You know,  CBS World Premiere,  movie,  but Star Wars.  Yeah.  But it would take years  to get on TV.  And then the other thing  was when you're like,  what was that actor's name  in that movie?  And you'd toil over it  for days sometimes.  And now you're like,  IMDB.  Do Cockney.  All right.  David Do Cockney  was in that.  You know what I found  the other day?  Late night,  I'll be on YouTube  and I'll just,  I don't know,  you just start remembering  stuff from your childhood.  I found the clip  where the $6 million man  fights the $7 million man 
[03:21:30]  and he punched  his face off.  He punches his face off.  His face falls off  and there's all these wires.  $7 million man  was paid by Ted Williams.  He punches his face off  and then conveniently  I didn't know  there was a $7 million man.  No, I didn't know either.  I know he fought Bigfoot.  No, he fought  the $7 million man  and that was a big thing.  Oh my God,  this guy's worth  a million more.  How's he going to beat him?  It was like the new iPhone  was fighting the old one  and he literally,  he punches his face off 
[03:22:00]  and the guy's like,  it's coming at him  and he,  it just conveniently  happens to be  a steel girder  from a skyscraper there  and he impales him with it.  It's awesome.  No, wait,  I didn't find it up.  I made a reference to it  on my podcast  and then like,  within like 20 minutes  somebody sent me the link  and they had it up there.  Dude,  and I was trying to explain  to somebody younger,  like,  you gotta understand  there was no cable,  there was no internet,  you have,  this blew my fucking mind  when I was six years old. 
[03:22:30]  Someone will find it,  one of your listeners.  It really is something though  because anything,  you can bring up anything  and remember something like,  God,  you know,  whenever we wanted to watch  that Archie Bunker clip  about when he's talking about  handing out guns  to prevent hijacking  and then collecting the guns back  and then bam,  there it was on the,  you know,  any clip from a show,  it just really is amazing.  And David was right  about the Michael Spinks  tube socks.  Yeah, yeah.  They were way up to his freaking knees.  He doesn't look like a boxer.  No.  No,  he didn't fight like one either  in that fight. 
[03:23:00]  Wow.  Pancreas.  Oh,  there it is,  the $7 million man.  He found it.  Are you kidding me?  Watch,  he's gonna punch his face off.  He's gonna punch his face off.  Oh,  it's a promo for a toy.  Oh,  wait a minute,  that's the picture.  Here it is.  Oh,  that music is horrible.  Okay,  the guy on the left  is worth $7 million.  He doesn't look it.  He doesn't look like  he's in shape  for $7 million.  For $7 million,  it's that guy.  His arms should bend.  Yeah,  we've seen that guy.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Yeah,  for $7 million, 
[03:23:30]  his arms should bend.  This is the longest fight ever.  That guy was in the Andromeda strain.  Here he goes.  Where's his,  there goes his face.  Look how lame  the face is.  You should get something better  for $7 million.  Oh,  no.  That gave me nightmares.  There's barely any wiring back there.  There's a steel girder.  But they're in the middle of nowhere.  They're in the middle of nowhere.  Why is a steel girder  in the middle of nowhere?  They're in the desert.  Watch this.  Oh,  he impales him. 
[03:24:00]  Wow.  Oh,  no.  He's not coming back for that.  $7 million fail.  Shot to shit.  Epic fail.  No face fail.  I hope he was insured.  Oh,  he picks up the face.  But the face looked pliable  when it was on him.  Yeah.  Now it's not moving.  It's got rigor now.  That's the fucking funniest thing  I've ever seen.  Wow.  People watched that show?  Oh,  dude,  it was incredible.  That show was huge.  I hope they're not  YouTubing the X-Files like that.  Out of context.  Oh,  my God. 
[03:24:30]  Look how lame.  Remember David DeCockney?  Oh,  that was awesome.  Oh,  that's hysterical though.  How bad was television?  They owe you money,  don't they,  David?  Who?  The X-Files?  No,  I don't think so.  Okay.  Wow,  you better check.  I got some wrong info then.  That was a while ago.  Okay,  that's old school.  Yeah,  yeah.  You guys figured that one out.  By the way,  one of my favorite clips.  We did.  Oh,  on the second run  when you got the $11 check,  you're like,  yeah,  I think it should be  a little higher than that.  One of my favorite clips though 
[03:25:00]  of X-Files  is when you're,  you got that goop all over you  and that underground thingy  and you like said something  like you're ready to lose  your cool demeanor.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  that was early on.  Yeah,  yeah,  that was early on.  That was a good clip though,  very funny.  Some bodily fluid  that I didn't want on him.  That I didn't want on me,  of course.  Oh,  this is,  yeah,  when he fights Bigfoot  and we found out  that's Andre the Giant  in the suit.  I think we're still arguing  over that point,  is it?  Definitely Andre.  We checked IMDB.  It's Andre.  He's credited as being Sasquatch. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  And why are they watching that?  Why wouldn't you have  a square TV?  Like,  I can understand  this is supposed to be  futuristic,  but like the TV  is very inconveniently  diamond shaped.  That's a weird shape,  yeah.  It's not a good aspect ratio.  I would have loved  to have seen them  shooting the shit  in between takes.  Well,  I'm telling you,  dressed as Sasquatch  with his legs crossed.  We had a couple times  where,  again on the X-Files  because we would have  had stuff like this,  but there was  an episode where  later in the run 
[03:26:00]  where I had to fight  a,  it was all  the repressed stuff  from this perfect community  that was going  into the sewers  and it had created  this horrible being  because everybody  was acting perfectly  and repressed.  I remember that one.  And this thing  comes out of  the shit monster,  basically,  comes out of the,  and he's the return  of the repressed.  He's killing people  in this perfect community  because they're not  dealing with their,  you know,  desires as humans  or whatever the point was.  But anyway,  it's building to the climax 
[03:26:30]  of this horrible shit monster  that I'm going to have  to throw down with,  right?  So we get to that point  and there are people  around watching us film  and this guy comes out,  this poor guy,  he's a big guy,  not like Andre the Giant,  but a big guy in a suit  and he looked as bad  as that $6 million star.  And then I had to act  like I was afraid of him  in front of people  and that hurt my feelings.  But the director,  the director was really angry 
[03:27:00]  because he had thought  that the creature  was going to look tougher  and scarier.  He actually said,  and this is a classic line  and I'm sure it'll get beeped.  No, no, we're on satellite.  He said,  that guy doesn't look scary.  He looks like the man  who fucked Mrs. Butterworth.  That's what he kind of looked like.  He was a glass bottle  full of maple syrup.  Wow.  So I had to act scared 
[03:27:30]  of the man  who looked like he fucked Mrs. Butterworth.  And did he say  within earshot  of the guy  who was dressed up that way?  He probably knew  he looked like shit.  The guy had,  you know,  he had so much latex on him  I don't think he could hear anything.  And he couldn't really move.  He was slow moving.  You know,  like when I would watch  the horror movies  when I was a kid,  I was terrified of Dracula  because he had moves  and he was slick.  He could fly.  He was quick.  But Frankenstein,  I always thought,  I could get away.  I could probably run.  Guy moved to one mile an hour.  Back metal.  Frankenstein and the mummy.  Yeah, 
[03:28:00]  the mummy is stupid.  But the werewolf and Dracula,  I had to give up.  They nailed you.  Yeah.  We got a couple people  on the phone.  Graham in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Talking to David Duchovny  from California.  Hi, Graham.  Hey,  I got a question  for David Duchovny there.  Yeah,  I wanted to know  as an actor,  can you still like  watch a movie  or a TV show  and be affected emotionally  or do you just see  people working? 
[03:28:30]  Well,  that's a good question.  Both.  It depends on,  I try to.  I want to enjoy  other people's work  and movies  and television and stuff  and sometimes it's hard  to distance yourself  from the fact  that you know  how it's made  and everything like that  but a great piece of work  is still going to be  moving and funny  and that.  So,  I would hope so  because I want to enjoy  stuff as much as anybody.  What have you liked recently?  Anything out there  that was  gotcha?  Let's take a no  on that one.  Well, 
[03:29:00]  I think we just  knocked his face off.  There was that one show.  You know,  there is something  but I'm not remembering.  I do like stuff.  I do.  I like stuff.  How often do you sit there  and you're looking  at something going,  oh God,  that's like a three-day shoot.  He's got to wear  that itchy shoe.  You know,  it's mostly when I watch  my stuff  and when old stuff  comes on  like old X-Files stuff,  I'll go,  oh man, 
[03:29:30]  I had such bad gas  during that.  Really?  Remember those little moments?  It's like watching  home movies.  Oh yeah,  I had the lasagna.  Yeah,  I remember that.  That was four in the morning,  that shot.  Look at that,  I'm asleep.  You watch stuff  and just think,  oh,  that guy's a hack.  Yeah,  so I watch it with my wife  and she's always very kind  because I honestly believe  that I'm like a slow builder,  learner in this business  and when I started,  I was green  and I sucked  and I was lucky enough  to get to go to work  every day for nine years 
[03:30:00]  and get better  but we'll look at old stuff  and I'll say,  oh my God,  that guy,  that guy up there,  that guy is horrible.  You really noticed  that big of a difference  between the first few X-Files  and like the end of the...  Well,  you know,  it's different  because I think I had  a lot of energy  and I really wanted  to do well  and there's a certain  kind of eagerness.  Yeah,  the character almost  had that in him.  And I think that works.  Yeah,  yeah.  But in terms of skill  or competence  or craft,  it's horrible. 
[03:30:30]  And then like,  you got into directing also  which now,  that obviously learned  just watching directors?  Yeah,  well,  watching,  just being on set  and seeing that  you can do it.  I guess the first,  the most important thing  to learn as a director  is you don't have to know  everybody else's job.  You just have to hire people  that are good at their jobs  and let them do their job.  At first,  I thought,  oh,  I got to know how to light.  I got to know how to do  craft service.  I got to know how to do  everything,  but you don't.  You just have to hire  good people. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah,  because anytime I've watched  people doing a shoot,  it's like the director  kind of,  I don't know,  other people are doing  everything.  The director's just kind of like,  kind of taking a look at it.  Yeah,  that looks good.  Yeah,  it looks good.  Let's move on to the next one.  You just have to work on  saying action really commandingly.  Yeah,  and making,  you know,  action.  The director's big job  is taking credit.  Rolling with the iron fist.  Everybody wants to talk to David.  Let's go to Mark in Philly.  Mark.  Hey,  what's up,  boys?  Hey,  man.  Mike.  Hey,  David,  I just realized that you've been  on the show for pretty much 
[03:31:30]  an hour,  which went by really quick,  and I just wanted to say  you're fucking awesome on the show.  We all enjoy you,  and hopefully we can hear more of you  in the months and years to come.  Good luck with Californication.  Thanks a lot.  You know,  when I directed a movie years ago  called House of D,  and we went down to the  Philadelphia Film Festival,  and I really hadn't been  down to Philly ever,  and I really enjoyed it down there,  so thank you for that.  Philly is pretty unique  as a city.  It's one of those  kind of standout cities.  Oh,  they're animals down there.  They really are just brutal.  There's two Phillies. 
[03:32:00]  There's a nice Philly,  and then there's outside.  evil Philly.  This is nice.  That's Ben Franklin's  first pair of glasses.  Stab,  stab,  stab.  What about the frame  of his house?  I know it's so quaint  in so many areas.  What about the frame  of his old house?  It's not even his house anymore.  Oh, Ben Franklin's house?  It's like,  this is sort of  what it looked like.  Yeah.  Yeah,  they have like posts  and a fake roof  which just sticks.  And then you walk in there  and they're like,  well,  this part was the kitchen,  but there's nothing that...  Nothing there.  Now they're digging up  George Washington's house. 
[03:32:30]  Well,  we all know  Franklin ordered out a lot.  He didn't even cook.  You can tell.  Yeah,  that's it.  It's like,  what the fuck is that?  You ordered it from  ye olde California pizza kitchen.  That is one of the worst  tourist attractions  I've ever seen in my life.  It's horrible.  Did it burn down  or they just didn't think  enough to save his house?  Yeah,  I don't think they knew back then.  It's like,  it's a gigantic bifocal house.  We're taking down  Franklin's house tomorrow.  Who gives a shit?  Right.  You know,  and then a couple of hundred years  goes by and you're like,  oh,  maybe we should have saved that.  Could have made some money off of it.  Let's go to Mike in Lindenhurst. 
[03:33:00]  Mike.  Mike.  Hey,  I just wanted to ask David,  what was it like  to be the FBI agent in drag  on Twin Peaks  and how he got that role?  Oh,  that's going way back.  That's going way fucking damn it.  That role was,  I believe,  originally written  for James Spader  who for some reason  couldn't do it  when it came time  to shoot it.  So they just sent out  this big casting call.  I hadn't really done much  at the time.  And I went in  and I remember bringing  a nail file  into the audition  like that was going  to be my drag. 
[03:33:30]  And somehow I got it.  It's going to be great.  Yeah.  I saw one of those  young actors,  hot nail file.  Yes!  This is a method.  I'm brilliant.  And then I didn't even use it.  I just kind of held it  like an ice cream stick  the whole time.  You walk in  and there's 10 guys  on line with nail files.  Oh,  no.  Oh,  damn it.  So I got it  and then I nared my legs.  That was an interesting experience.  We nared my legs  in the trailer.  And I remember  I was working out  at a gym  at that point  in West Hollywood. 
[03:34:00]  And I remember  going in with  what I was referring to  as fur shorts  at that point.  Oh,  because you only had  an air up to a certain point.  It was a bad,  bad look.  Especially at a gym.  Yeah.  Especially at that gym.  Oh,  shit.  From here up,  I'm all man.  That's you?  Oh,  wow.  David's like,  oh,  no,  no,  no.  Now you're sad  it's radio.  Yeah,  exactly.  Oh,  my God.  That's hysterical.  You're going to the legs,  though.  You're a good looking broad. 
[03:34:30]  I think I know why  James Spader wasn't available.  Yeah,  James Spader went,  what?  I had a good personality.  Wow.  Wow.  That is hysterical.  It was a great character.  The idea was that  I was a DEA agent  that had gone  undercover drag  to make a bust  and liked it.  So I stayed.  Is that the only clip you have?  I thought you'd come in  with your bedroom eyes.  Yeah,  that's really kind of  a nice entrance there.  I had no idea.  Look at that.  At that point,  I remember just getting a call  to play a transvestite. 
[03:35:00]  I got the sides.  They seemed very funny.  What's this?  This is me telling the story.  Yeah,  look at that.  You just told that.  Sorry to repeat myself.  Well,  it's weird.  You kind of looked like  Linda Hamilton  from Terminator.  Terminator.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think she had bigger guns.  I see that.  Just a little bit.  Let's go to Matt  on Long Island.  Matt.  Hey,  Duke Cockney.  Have you?  Thanks, Matt.  X-Files dialogue  into Californication  like Truth is Out There 
[03:35:30]  or something like that?  I'm sorry,  what was the question?  I'll work at some X-File lines.  Oh,  like sneak in a line  for some of the fans  or something?  No,  I try not to do stuff like that.  I always find,  you know,  it kind of takes you out  of whatever show you're doing,  but if it works,  it works.  I mean,  if there was a reference  to the X-Files in the show,  it might work,  but I don't know.  I don't think so.  I'd like to keep them separate.  Keep them separated.  Well,  I'm a big fan of Duke Cockney.  I love you.  I appreciate that.  We get it. 
[03:36:00]  Just back from Afghanistan.  Yeah,  this might be good.  All right,  let me say hi to,  wow,  a little compliment for you.  Scott in St. Louis.  Hey,  ladies,  how you doing?  Oh,  good,  Scott.  Hey,  David,  I want to thank you  for Californication.  It's a fantastic show.  I just got back  from my latest deployment  to Afghanistan,  and I work in Intel  sitting in the op center,  had Californication  on the computer  while operations  are going down.  I had comedy and porn  and people getting killed. 
[03:36:30]  It was fantastic.  It was perfect.  What a great military  we have.  I'm going to kill  that Al-Qaeda guy.  Hang on.  TiVo the show.  Isn't that great?  You could just watch TV  and wipe a few people out.  Why not?  Chris in Pennsylvania  wants to know  if you could start  watching Californication now  and not be lost.  I think you could.  Oh, sure, yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  It's a comedy.  It's not really,  it's not...  Are the other seasons out?  They are.  It's not lost.  It's not lost.  It's not heroes.  It's not plot driven that way.  Right, right. 
[03:37:00]  You can certainly  enjoy it.  Jump right in.  Yeah.  Start laughing.  Yeah, we have no plot.  It's nothing.  No, just keep the laughs coming.  Yeah.  Who picks the music  for the show?  Mostly Tom Kaponos.  Some good choices.  Yeah, he's a guitar player himself  and he's got really good...  And I like to get involved  in the music too.  Yeah, right.  Did they put out a CD  of the music?  Yeah, they did.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  That's something I should pick up.  Yeah.  A lot of covers and stuff.  Uh-huh.  Good covers.  Really good covers  of really good rock songs.  Yeah.  I think we're heading  to the finish line, Ed. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, very nice.  It's Friday.  Let's get the out  of here and begin the weekend.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  No problem.  Give the big plug there.  Californication Sundays  at 10 on Showtime.  Anything else you're promoting, David?  Not right now.  I'll come back though.  All right.  No Twitter, none of that crap?  Anytime.  I don't tweet or twat or anything.  It is a weird thing,  that whole social networking thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I did a movie  with Demi Moore  that'll come out  and I'll come back  and promote that when it does, 
[03:38:00]  but she's a big tweeter.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's one of the most popular ones.  It's like ridiculous  that they're tweeting.  I don't think they're married.  I can't say tweeting.  It's got to be Twittering.  Tweeting is just...  Tweet!  Twittering's bad enough.  Just doing it is bad enough.  I feel like an old fuddy-duddy  when I poo-poo it, though.  I don't even know  what I'm talking about.  Why, you kids  in your computer eyes?  Meh.  I'm one of the only people  left on MySpace  at this point.  Yeah, that's the line.  That's God.  You want to be the last one  to leave.  No, I really  It is your space, Bill. 
[03:38:30]  It's not called Bill Space.  No, I refuse to go to Facebook.  I'm like,  I'm not going to go add  the same 30,000 douchebags.  It's the same fucking people.  They're acting like  they're all...  No, these are the cool  random people.  By the way, douchebags,  Bill's playing five shows  this weekend  at the Stress Factory.  He said,  douchebags, come on out.  I'm sorry.  Am I trashing?  You're trashing your people.  I'm not.  They know.  They've got better things to do.  You're doing well, Vinny.  Don't worry.  I just discovered texting.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's handy. 
[03:39:00]  That was supposed to be funny.  Now it is.  Epic fail.  You do cockney fail.  I had to go out  with an epic fail.  No, you can't do that.  It was going so well.  That's not good.  Let's say hi to footer.  Footer.  Hey, what's up, boys?  I'll go fucking chicken.  I got a quick question  for David Duchovny.  News guy said that  on the air.  He did.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, dude,  do some fucking rubes  come up to you  and ask you UFO questions 
[03:39:30]  and shit like you are  the character?  That's a good question.  Yeah, sometimes.  Sometimes.  Do you believe in UFOs?  Yeah, they ask me that  all the time.  That's the big one, right?  Yeah, do I believe in UFOs  and that.  And it was always  just weird to me  that they would confuse  me with the character  that way.  But I came up  with a theory  a long time ago  which was  that, you know,  there used to be  this thing,  Ship of Fools,  where they would,  when their prisons  would overrun  back in the 16th,  17th century, 
[03:40:00]  they just put all  the nutcases  on a boat  and send them out.  And then they'd float around  until they'd all  kill each other  or run across  another boat  and try to kill them.  So that's the Ship of Fools  out there.  Crazy people.  It's a great idea, right?  That is fantastic.  So my theory is this,  that alien civilizations  have done exactly that.  That they've taken  all their offenders  and dentists  because apparently  all these aliens  want to do  is probe our anuses  and drill our teeth.  Right.  So what the alien civilizations  have done  is they've taken  all their sex offenders 
[03:40:30]  and dentists  and put them on  their alien Ship of Fools  and now they're around here.  And they sometimes  bump into the planet  and sexually assault us  or ruin our teeth.  They really like  our heinies.  That's a decent theory.  Wow.  It's not a bad theory, right?  You like that one?  I like it.  I like that old school stuff.  I used to go drinking  in a bar,  Ship of Fools,  and I had no idea  what it was.  But they were actually  kind of insulting me  that I would actually  go in there.  That's like a great  reality show.  Yeah, you're right.  Just ship out lunatics  and then just have  cameras everywhere  and see who they run into. 
[03:41:00]  I got one for you.  There's one,  something I learned  on the internet  the other day.  is back in the day  there was a street  in England  called Grope Cunt Lane.  And it was literally  where the prostitutes were.  David just looked  out the window  like,  help me.  That's where  the prostitutes were.  This is a real story.  Yeah,  and then politically  corrected,  they called it  something like  Grape Lane  or something.  I don't know,  they switched it up.  Go ahead,  look it up.  It's on Wikipedia.  It's got to be true.  Well, in England, 
[03:41:30]  that word's a little  more accepted.  You are at your destination.  The word's a lot  more acceptable  in England,  apparently.  Yeah,  right there.  There you go.  Grope Cunt  was a street  found in English towns  and cities  during the Middle Ages.  I grew up on 11th Street  and 2nd Avenue  and I will tell you  that 12th  between 2nd and 3rd  was that land.  It was called  That Land.  There you go.  Yeah,  that's where  Jimmy would hang out there.  He's had a couple  good ones.  We should end right now.  I could go south 
[03:42:00]  at any moment.  We got the plugs in  so Bill Burr,  it was great seeing you.  Are you around Monday?  Yeah,  I'm going to come through.  You coming back through?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Nice.  We try to get Bill on  as much as possible.  I'm going to be hyping  my town hall gig.  Really?  Vinny's going to be pissed.  No.  Don't say you're going  to be in the area.  No.  Town hall is big  and impersonal.  Enjoy the show.  November 6th.  Vinny,  your tickets are,  they've got to be good  for the weekend.  They're selling very,  very well.  Vinny's Stress Factory 
[03:42:30]  slash Best Buy store.  That he has out there.  He has like 58  flat screen TVs.  Jerry Jones ripped off  the big flat screen  from him.  He do have a lot  of TVs there.  Yeah.  Look at this.  I'm here while you're  filling up the backpack.  This is serious.  Yeah, I know.  Let's let David go.  I am a get the hell  out of here guy, man.  Yeah, it's Friday.  I run from this place.  I'm Friday.  I run from this place on Friday.  Californication,  Sundays at 10 on Showtime.  We'll all be watching.  David, it was a pleasure.  Come back and see us.  My pleasure.  Thank you.  And guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Party.  Come to my house.
