<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with an unknown individual performing a self-deprecating song about a lazy, slovenly, and inconsiderate person, repeatedly questioning, "What do I do?"  Around the two-minute, thirty-second mark, WWE Superstar John Cena unexpectedly appeared in the studio, referring to the broadcast as "the worst of Opie and Anthony" and identifying the hosts as Sam Robertson and E-Rock.  No further information about the show's content is available beyond this initial segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll make the bed up straight, I always stay out late, I never take you out, that's what you're all about.  I always smell like smoke, everything's just a joke, I never look at you, when you come hear me sing.  These are not all of me, many simple things, you can't find wrong with me, what would you tell me please?  What do I do? 
[00:00:30]  I never talk to you, be who you want me to, my music's way too loud, my friends are all so proud, say I'm just wasted hope, I could not fret the rope, more than my pockets broke, and you don't see a ring. 
[00:01:00]  These are not all of me, infinitesimal things, you can't find wrong with me, what would you tell me please?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  I wanted to play the game, yes you're right. 
[00:01:30]  We're losing the game, doesn't it mean, but we're losing the fight.  What do I do?  What do I do? 
[00:02:00]  What do I do, right?  What do I do?  I won't make the bed up straight  I always stay hungry 
[00:02:30]  What do I do?  What do I do that is?  What do I do?  What do I do that is?  Hey, what's up?  This is WWE Superstar John Cena.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony,
