<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, focusing heavily on the fallout from a "cake horn" incident on the Ron and Fez show, involving a heated argument between Fez and an unnamed party.  The pre-show also reviewed the previous day's Opie and Anthony show, highlighting Opie's airport mishap story ("Chip" story) and Jimmy Norton's multiple on-air personas.  Conan O'Brien hosting the MTV Movie Awards, Jimmy Kimmel's refusal to apologize to Rob Ford, John Travolta's "Adele Dazeem" Oscars flub, and allegations about Chelsea Handler's past were also discussed. A caller claimed four justifiable homicides as a bounty hunter.  A significant portion was dedicated to a furious attack on Jason Ellis, accusing him of ingratitude, dishonesty, and boasting about his show's success, which Opie and Anthony vehemently disputed. Scott Farrell and Tracy Morgan were mentioned in the context of similar perceived disloyalty.  The low pay at SiriusXM, exemplified by Dr. Steve's $150 per show, was also criticized.

The main show opened with Anthony recounting a failed prank call to Mancow Muller and discussing Mullerâ€™s various media ventures, including a militia and a repossession show.  A lengthy, sexually explicit discussion about Buff Bagwell's new career as a gigolo followed, transitioning into a discussion about the high cost of living in New York City and criticism of Mayor Bill de Blasio's policies, particularly his disagreements with Governor Andrew Cuomo. Listener calls offered differing perspectives on the charter school debate. The feud with Fez continued, with multiple clips of Fez's reactions to the "cake horn" incident being played and mocked.

A substantial segment focused on a conflict between Fez and studio intern Vito, with accusations of bullying flying from both sides. A "K-Corn incident" (unspecified) on Ron and Fez was also discussed, with a caller using highly offensive language to accuse Fez of bullying interns.  The Kate Korn incident was referenced, implying Sam Roberts' involvement.  This was followed by a promotional segment for Chelsea Handler's upcoming appearances.  Jim Norton then graphically described his anal hygiene routine in a comedic exchange with a child.  Further discussion covered a botched WWE advertisement read, new Samsung phones and watches, and a parody of "Her" featuring Bill Burr.  A heated phone call with a listener, Lenny, who defended Jason Ellis, ensued.

Chelsea Handler's guest appearance began with discussions of Vladimir Putin, fisting, and Handler's sexual experiences.  The conversation touched upon Chewy's pornography appearance, Handler's attraction to little people, and the use of offensive language, particularly "midget."  Handler promoted her book, *Uganda Be Kidding Me*, sharing anecdotes from her travels. Sam Roberts' unexpected studio entry led to more banter.  The segment included a graphic initiation for intern David involving a pornographic video ("two girls, one cup").  Conversations with Bob Levy, Steve Blatter, and a caller named Dave (who remained accidentally connected) followed, along with discussion of podcast statistics and upcoming guests (Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Neil deGrasse Tyson).

The show's final segment covered news stories about overly strict school zero-tolerance policies, John Travolta's "Adele Dazeem" mispronunciation, and crude speculation about Jimmy Fallon.  *The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3* was also discussed. The feud with Fez, centered around "#cakehorn," continued, involving listener calls and DJ Who Kid.  The show concluded with a promotion for their podcast and tour dates, interspersed with personal anecdotes, off-color jokes, and insults directed at various individuals and radio personalities.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous advertisements for various products and services were interspersed.

Feel free to join me in counting down those minutes by calling the show 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  And if you're shy, you can tweet along with us at O&AShow on Twitter. 
[00:01:30]  A lot to get into today, of course.  Every day here on the pre-show, we break down what went on yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll give you a little taste of some of what you might have missed and talk about what's going to be going down today.  Chelsea Handler is going to be in studio today, which is a big, big guest for the Opie and Anthony show.  She hasn't been on in years.  She was on once while we were on K-Rock, but I don't think she's been back since then. 
[00:02:00]  And she's always got something to say.  Of course, now she's been in the news because people didn't like that she made a 12 years of slave joke on Twitter.  So I'm sure that she'll get into that and a lot more once she gets here on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Phones are already ringing.  Let's start with John in Philly.  What's up, John?  Hey, Sam.  I have a very show-pressing issue.  Good.  That's what we try to tackle here on the pre-show.  Yes.  Nutribullet.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Is it the same thing as a Vitamix or is it a little different?  I don't know anything about this Vitamix.  It sounds like Vitamix is the same.  It's like a blender.  Is Vitamix a blender?  Yeah.  It's like one of those two-horsepower things.  I don't know.  I'd stick with the Nutribullet.  The only way, because I need to be able to guarantee that there's going to be a boost.  Do you know what I mean?  Well, boost is just what you put in there.  Well, yeah, but the Nutribullet really, really puts the emphasis on a boost, and that's why I've been enjoying it. 
[00:03:00]  Gotcha.  Could I have one of those DJ Who Kid mix tapes?  Tweet at O&A Show, and we'll find you.  Thanks, man.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.  You can do that for him, right, Sal?  You got it.  Good.  Good.  Yesterday, we got into a lot of stuff.  It turned out to be a really great show on yesterday's Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, there was some cross-promotion going on.  The Ron and Fez show on Raw Dog, every day at noon, used to follow us here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[00:03:30]  And there are a couple people, I mean, most people understand that all you have to do is change the channel if you want to hear them.  But some people are like, I don't understand.  Why don't they put Ron and Fez back on the channel?  And it's like, well, I mean, it really impacts your life zero.  Just change to Channel 99.  I get it if you want to hear new programming, but literally, just turn the channel.  So Fez made a bit of a faux pas on the Ron and Fez show on Monday.  And we highlighted that yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:00]  That would be track nine, Sal.  In this case, I think it applies.  It goes in one side and the noise comes out the other.  You fucked up.  People are talking about me.  But look.  I'm not out of their cake horns.  It's not about the cake horn, Chris.  It is about the fucking cake horn.  It's crazy.  It's not about the cake horn.  It's about somebody talking shit about me again. 
[00:04:30]  Here's the, you know why it's not about the.  Don't focus on that.  But you know why it's not about the cake horn?  Because there's no fucking such thing as a cake horn.  This thing's been derailed by the cake horn.  It doesn't exist.  Try to forget the fact, Chris.  Um, excuse me.  Is this the bakery?  I'd like to order a cake horn.  What do you mean it's not a real thing?  Isn't it a horn made out of cake?  Or is it?  What do you think? 
[00:05:00]  It's a horn filled with cake.  I think it's a horn filled with cake.  There is no such thing as a cake horn.  Know that.  It's cake whole.  Wow.  That's fucking funny.  I know those guys got cake horn trending all over the place yesterday on Twitter, right?  Cake horn.  Cake horn.  Yeah.  Became the number one trending topic in the United States yesterday.  Nice.  It's, it just completely stopped the argument, the discussion they were having.  Did you just say cake horn?  That's all it takes. 
[00:05:30]  All of a sudden, discussion over cake horn.  Was that the sound of a cake horn you just made?  Yes, cake horn.  It is funny that no matter how valid the argument may be, once you say something like cake horn,  it just throws everything out the window.  I don't know if we'll get back into that on today's Opie and Anthony show, but I do know  that Fez was not happy, especially with me, specifically, that we spent, of course, right?  That we spent so much time talking about cake horn yesterday, which was really only about  20 minutes.  But, I thought we were celebrating the fact that the Ron and Fez show got a number one 
[00:06:00]  trend in the United States.  Apparently, Fez is not something he's proud of.  So, we may revisit that today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Who really knows?  Let's go to CT in the Bronx.  What's up, buddy?  V. Sam Roberts.  What's up, buddy boy?  How you doing this morning?  Good.  How are you?  Really quick.  I caught the replay the other day.  I didn't mean to call.  The chick that presented with Matthew McConaughey at the Oscars, did she talk like this?  Sounded like the bad guy from Hannibal 2 that had his lips cut off. 
[00:06:30]  I just couldn't have left my ass off thinking about it.  But, Team Cake Corn, have a good day, bud.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Of course, that was the actress from Vertigo that we were talking about either on Monday  or Tuesday on the show yesterday.  Yesterday, though, Jim, I felt like he was kind of maybe, not slipping into insanity, but  there were enough moments on yesterday's show that one could make the argument.  Like, if Jim did something crazy, they would look back on some of the clips from yesterday's show 
[00:07:00]  and realize, uh-oh, we saw this coming.  First, it was the multiple personalities.  He just started shifting into characters.  This was, I don't know why.  Usually, Opie avoids chip stories.  But yesterday, not only did he not avoid it, he welcomed it.  This was Opie's fault that this went out on the air yesterday.  I don't know what was going on in Opie's head, but he needed a chip story.  And boy, did he get it.  I'm going through security, right? 
[00:07:30]  And I got my bags, and he got his, and we're standing there, right?  And I get up to the fucking lady.  Yeah.  And I hand over my fucking board and pass and driver's license, and she's looking at  it, and she's looking at me, and she goes, just nothing for a second, right?  Yeah.  I got my bags and stuff ready for the plane.  All right.  He's got his bags all both ready for the, trying to get through the aircraft.  Oh, my.  There's going to be storms.  This is the last chance we have. 
[00:08:00]  And she looks at the boarding pass, and she goes, this isn't you.  And inside, I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm going through all these movies.  Like, maybe this is something got switched in the hotel.  And I'm like, ready for the plane.  And all of a sudden, fucking, he handed me the wrong boarding pass.  I had his.  I had to give it back to him and get mine.  Back me up. 
[00:08:30]  Back me up.  That really happened.  Oh.  He's only telling you half the story.  Well, you remember you woke up in the morning.  You got dressed.  Then we got in the car.  Fuck yeah.  It was a long ride.  Drive to the airport.  Fuck yeah.  I forgot about that.  Then you got out of the car.  That's right.  Got your luggage out of the trunk.  You remember I put the bags in the wrong water for a second?  Yeah.  That was crazy.  Can't believe we made it back.  It was cold.  Fuck yeah.  You know, we walked into the terminal.  I made a mistake. 
[00:09:00]  I gave you my boarding pass and had yours.  I knew you guys wouldn't believe it.  The only thing worse than a Chip story is when Chip and Kenny become a comic duo.  Like, Kenny's the one guy that will try to extend a Chip story.  It's amazing.  Let's go to Daniel, all the way in Korea.  What's up, Daniel?  Hey.  Hey, Primetime.  How you doing?  Good, buddy.  I just have a quick question for you.  Yeah.  Why are you being such a bully and running your cake horn and riding Fez ass all the time? 
[00:09:30]  The first two hours of running Fez yesterday were all about you bullying Fez.  Well, yeah.  See, that's the thing.  I mean, I didn't realize I was being a bully by presenting clips to Opie and Anthony that  we spent about 20 minutes on, which turned into, yeah, two hours of me being a bully, I guess.  Yeah, you're obviously gay bashing him, Sam.  You can even tell that loud and clear in Korea, huh?  Oh, yeah, all the time, Sam.  I mean, it came across that quick. 
[00:10:00]  So, have a good one, buddy.  Thank you, Daniel.  I don't know what goes on over there.  All I know is when I hear something funny happen on the radio, I present it to the Opie  and Anthony show so we can either agree with it or make fun of it.  And that's what we'll be doing again today when the show starts in about 20 minutes.  The other thing, right after Jim was doing the Chip stuff, he slipped right into regular  Joe.  And this is what weirds me out. 
[00:10:30]  It's not so much that he does the one character.  It's when he starts slipping into and out of multiple characters, like boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom.  This happened right after that Chip story happened.  Although, I don't know if your parents are responsible for tuition until you're 21 if they  don't want to be.  No, of course not.  She needs a place to stay.  They're under Obama, aren't they?  No problem.  For tuition?  Hell no.  You know, rooms available.  I paid for my house.  I paid for every cent of my college.  They weren't responsible for anything.  No, no.  But I mean, there's a new thing that I said with Obama. 
[00:11:00]  No, I think what you're talking about is...  No, that's the Obamacare.  Yeah, they can still be covered under your parents' house.  Oh, you're right, right.  But not tuition.  Oh, my God.  I wish that was the case.  A lot of people would be happy out there.  A lot of us had to pay for our own skewling.  The skewling.  Yeah, there was no tuition in the School of Hard Knocks.  Hell no.  Yeah, you're not kidding.  You know what I paid?  Blood, sweat, and tears.  Did you?  You bet I did.  Regular Joe?  Yeah, you see these calluses?  That's my tuition. 
[00:11:30]  That's your tuition right there.  Hey, carry those bricks.  You got it.  That's my tuition.  Yeah, Miss Fancy wants everything paid for.  Or, get yourself a ham sandwich, get to work.  A ham sandwich.  Who goes to school with a ham sandwich?  I don't have money for my tuition and a ham sandwich.  But that's regular Joe inserting himself into the show, as he does from time to time.  But I guess we appreciate that.  866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969 if you want to call the pre-show. 
[00:12:00]  As I said, Chelsea Handler is going to be in studio today.  They just made the announcement that Conan O'Brien is going to be the host of the MTV Movie Awards.  Which is just like, oh no.  Like, that's not even...  I don't know.  It almost comes across as a little desperate to me.  It's like you're seeing, like, Kimmel.  Hey, Kimmel's in the news because Doug Ford, Rob Ford's brother.  We were playing yesterday on the show, we were playing clips of Rob Ford on Jimmy Kimmel, which was hilarious. 
[00:12:30]  But then Doug Ford comes out and says, wow, you know, Jimmy Kimmel apologized to my brother for some of the way that he treated him on the air.  Jimmy Kimmel tweeted immediately and said, I absolutely did not apologize to Rob Ford at any moment of the day.  And I never will.  So, which you got to give Jimmy Kimmel respect for.  But, we were talking about Jim on yesterday's show.  Not Jimmy Kimmel.  Not Jimmy Fallon. 
[00:13:00]  Our own Jimmy.  Little Jimmy Norton.  The best of all the Jimmys.  And he doesn't mind...  Like, we were talking about him being crazy, of course, with the characters.  But he also doesn't mind sort of revealing his psychosi for the entertainment of all of us.  Like, that's the main thing that makes Norton so good for the show, is honesty over things that, I mean, most of us, if we had these thoughts, would not make public.  But Jim just brought him up in conversation yesterday. 
[00:13:30]  Let's go to track 12.  You were saying off mic that you understand his anger.  Yeah, like, I'm not saying he should have shot this girl, of course.  But that's why I don't own a gun, because in those moments where you're in a power-driven, furious argument, I have absolutely been angry enough to kill the person I was arguing with.  Wow.  Holy shit.  And I'm not saying that for any reason other than the fact of...  That's why I've never owned a firearm, because in that moment, you can end their life and ruin their family's lives and end and ruin your own life. 
[00:14:00]  And like a split second later, you'd be like, uh-oh.  The second you smell that gunpowder or whatever happens when you fire a weapon, you would go, oh my God, I've done it.  I've done the unreversible.  What goes through your head, though?  I told you, I remember me and my ex were arguing one time, and she wouldn't stop, and it was late, and I was trying to sleep.  And I was, first of all, I was physically stopping my fist from coming over and just punching her in the face. 
[00:14:30]  But I've never hit a girl in my life.  It doesn't take a tough guy to hit a girl, so I don't do it.  But I could feel myself, I could feel the pull of my body wanting me to.  Oh my God.  And I thought to myself, I want to stab her to death.  Like, I really want to stab her.  Oh my God.  That's fantastic.  I guess you wanted to hear the vinyl, huh?  What's that?  I guess you wanted to hear the record.  I heard you.  It's even better.  We heard yous are even better in studio.  That was Dennis, of course, Dennis Falcone. 
[00:15:00]  Then, somebody called up.  We'll go to the next track.  Somebody called up trying to say, Jim, like, I don't think that's right.  Just because you have a gun doesn't mean you want to use it.  I mean, you have a car, and you don't want to run people over, right?  So this is how Jim handled that.  When you're on the street next to a car, do you have the urge to jump in it and run somebody over if you're having an argument?  You know, I don't understand.  I'll tell you.  One time I was driving.  Because I have the car, I think that.  I don't do it. 
[00:15:30]  Like, that's why I'm saying maybe I wouldn't have done that in that moment.  You wouldn't have.  I don't know if I would have or not, but I'm saying in those instant moments.  I remember one time I had landed an MTV pilot.  Oh, no.  There's another time.  But this was years ago.  I lived still in central Jersey.  Oh, that's okay.  And I was driving home, and I had a good bit of news that day.  And I'm driving my car, and I was kind of cranky behind the wheel.  And I remember all I wanted to do was gun it and kill a pedestrian.  I could feel myself wanting to do that.  And, of course, I didn't do it. 
[00:16:00]  So, dude, I don't know what you're saying.  Like, I'm saying what my mind was saying in that moment.  I'm not saying it's rational or I would have done it.  That's the greatest part.  The gym was like, no, you don't understand.  I also want to run over pedestrians.  And I would think, I would like to say, and I guess we would all like to say, I could never see myself getting that mad.  I could never see myself being so mad that I literally wanted to stab someone to death.  But, let's go to track 10, Sal.  And you tell me that this clip doesn't make you so mad that you don't want to stab this guy to death. 
[00:16:30]  What are some of the St. Paddy's Day songs you're going to play on Monday for us?  Well, I have a whole collection on the hard drive of hits.  We have a McNamara's band.  We could come in and out of the stop sets with Irish music.  And, you know.  I like it.  I called myself Dennis O'Falcone that day.  Yeah.  Anthony Okumia.  Right, I get it.  I get the whole gist.  And if anybody happens to know anybody who has an Irish bar, we can have them call in from around the country. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Say what is wrong?  You know, what kind of, maybe they have some acts there.  Jimmy O'Norton is not liking this.  What are they going to say?  We could get some big pipers in.  Yeah, it's crazy down here.  Everybody's drinking.  Yep.  Kids a shit.  In that moment, if somebody had stabbed Dennis O'Falcone to death, I don't think anybody would have blamed anyone for it.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969 is the phone number to call the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  We were talking about, of course, Conan is going to be hosting the MTV Movie Awards. 
[00:17:30]  Roland made a little face.  I think that's the face everybody's making.  Like, really?  It's one step.  Yeah, it's like, we get that there's a lot of young talk show hosts.  But you can't go backwards.  You've got to go forwards doing your own thing.  But who knows?  Maybe it'll do very well.  You don't think so?  Jimmy Kimmel's apology.  And, of course, John Travolta.  I'm not even going to tell you what his quote was.  You know, ever since he made the big Adele Nazeem or whatever he said at the Oscars, everybody's been talking about him. 
[00:18:00]  I'm not going to tell you what his quote was.  I want Opie and Anthony to go over his quote later in the show today because it relates specifically to a song lyric psychology that we've been associating ourselves with lately on the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't want to give you any more than that, but I promise you you'll enjoy it.  And, of course, Chelsea Handler in studio. 
[00:18:30]  We talked about that earlier.  Yesterday was a big, big day in terms of guests and pop culture relevancy on the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, we found the video that made rounds, which was the fake chef on the local news show yesterday.  The fake chef was everywhere.  I think his name was Chef Keith.  And he went on, this guy, he went on local news pretending to have a book on how to cook leftovers. 
[00:19:00]  And he has no idea how to cook.  The book doesn't exist.  And he was just going on to make a fool out of these newscasters because, I mean, you could just have a segment on the local news if you want.  Let's start with track three, Sal.  And this is as we're listening to the clips of him on the news.  Chef Keith Gerke is here, author of leftovers rights, making a winner of last night's dinner.  I'm self-taught.  I did not go to culinary school.  And I'm kind of unorthodox.  People compare. 
[00:19:30]  Are you familiar with G.G. Allen?  He threw his own shit at the audience.  He shoved bananas up his ass and shitted out into the crowd.  Anytime anyone can not only fool the news but also get a G.G. Allen reference, they're gold in my eyes.  Gold, Jerry, gold.  Let's get to the next clip of the fake chef on the local news. 
[00:20:00]  Go to the fridge.  Take out the container.  You can make your leftovers even greater.  Wrap is great.  Wrap is great.  Boom.  And this is like Jamba Juice, eat your heart out, right?  Just take a funnel that you can get at a hardware store.  Jamba Juice, eat your heart out.  Eat your heart out.  Blending fucking meat leftovers.  He's making ham and pumpkin pie juice.  Eat your heart out.  That's Jamba Juice. 
[00:20:30]  Why didn't we think of that?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  He was awesome.  He was my hero for doing this.  Let's get to the next track.  And safety is important, too.  Like, why don't you go ahead and take your scissors, cut that out.  They're cutting Peter with scissors.  Yeah, you can't.  I mean, I do stress.  We have a motto in the Gerke family.  Accidents stink.  You don't want to have an accident.  So when you're doing things, you know, when you're here, you've got to be.  In the family.  Accidents stink.  That's a good family motto to have.  Yeah, in the Gerke family. 
[00:21:00]  In the Gerke family.  It just went on and on.  And it's amazing that nobody's on television.  And nobody calls this guy on his bullshit.  This was my favorite clip.  This was the one that I was like, somebody would have to say, he's not serious.  This isn't true.  But nobody called him on it.  They just went through their segment as usual.  It's just brainless local news.  And I think this clip highlights that better than any of them.  And I think a lot of people, they don't like turkey.  Because what I hear over and over is when they, you know, microwave it. 
[00:21:30]  And when it has the smell, it kind of is like, you know, you take off the lid.  And it's like, who farted?  Or what, you know.  And it's like, what it is, I found.  There's bacteria that forms like a flatulence smell.  Or kind of like a bathroom smell.  But it's fine.  It's perfect.  Oh, my God.  And she's like, yeah, yeah.  Who eats turkey that smells like shit?  Smells like flatulence.  I've never heard anyone have that reaction to leftover turkey before.  Oh, it smells like somebody farted in here.  Let's go to some calls. 
[00:22:00]  866-WOW1-WOW to call the pre-show.  We go to Peter on Long Island.  What's up, Peter?  Good old Sam Roberts.  Morning.  Morning, buddy.  I read yesterday on the internet that we just gave a billion dollars to the Ukraine.  A billion.  That's insane.  And I'm sure we haven't talked much about the whole Ukraine thing on the O&A show.  But Jim, especially, has always been outspoken about giving other countries aid when we haven't really figured our stuff out here.  And I'm sure Ant doesn't want billions of his tax dollars going over to the Ukraine. 
[00:22:30]  So hopefully today we can get into that.  I just did my taxes yesterday, buddy, and I have to pay an extra $1,015 on top of everything else.  I get home, and the first thing I read is that we give a billion to the Ukraine.  Right.  Yeah.  Unbelievable, dude.  You'd think they would at least wait until after tax season so people don't literally see the money flying away from their bank accounts.  Nice.  Thanks, buddy. 
[00:23:00]  Sean in Maryland.  I'm sure we'll get into the Ukraine thing.  I mean, we haven't this week yet, so I can't be sure.  But I would think we'll get into that today.  Sean in Maryland.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  I was just thinking that maybe you and your mentor, Opie, would be interested in knowing about Chelsea Handlers.  I guess he's a dwarf midget, whatever you want to call him on our show.  But he's got some porn clips on YouTube.  That might be a nice awkward moment to just stumble onto during the show.  I feel like we should definitely bring up the fact that Chewy was in some pornos.  Chewy, that's his name. 
[00:23:30]  Right?  Yeah, we'll make sure that they get that information.  Mike in Jersey, welcome to the pre-show.  What's up, Sam?  How are you, man?  Good.  I got a question for you.  I've been listening to you guys a long time.  Sort of listening to Ron and Fez.  I guess, if it's a piece to when you guys are not.  I've never understood the Fez angle, and I was hoping you could clarify it for me.  He seems to be the whole.  He doesn't have anything.  I'd rather listen to Denny with Ron.  I don't know what the Fez angle is.  I know that Ron and Fez have been a great radio show for a long, long time. 
[00:24:00]  Fez made a turn at some point where he doesn't like to talk as much anymore and where he's very, very, very,  very sensitive about things now.  All I do is I listen to the show, I get entertainment out of it, and then I leave.  I don't put too much thought into it.  I laugh at the parts that I find funny, and then I go home for the day.  And I think that's the best possible strategy to take.  Yeah, because, I mean, really, the only guy you're laughing at, then, is Ron and Fez.  I mean, the guy's hysterical, but I didn't know if he had changed over the years or what. 
[00:24:30]  So thanks for clarifying that.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Superfan something in Philly.  It's Superfan Eric.  Sam, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, besides the 37 seconds spent on Chelsea Handler, what else am I to look forward to today?  Well, I'll tell you this.  As I said, the John Travolta, I guess it was kind of an explanation.  John Travolta got into how he feels after the nation has turned on him for mispronouncing that chick's name at the Oscar show. 
[00:25:00]  And his quote is among the most douche-chilling things you'll ever read.  And so much so, I don't want to read the quote on the pre-show.  I want to leave that to Opie and Anthony.  And, you know, everything else we talked about, the Kimmel non-apology, Conan being at the movie awards,  I'm sure we'll get into, and maybe today will be the day for the Ukraine talk.  But I said that yesterday was a big day for guests in pop culture.  Chelsea Handler today, yesterday, you just heard clips of the fake chef that was all over the news. 
[00:25:30]  Thanks to Roland and those fast fingers and that wonderful diction of his,  we were able to get the fake chef on the phone yesterday.  And he talked a little bit about what it was like actually being on the news  and handing a reporter a full blender, full of blended leftovers.  There was ham in there, ham and like spinach.  It was the most disgusting thing on the news.  Let's go to track 16.  She went right for it, which surprised me. 
[00:26:00]  But she just took the littlest sip.  And this smoothie, it doesn't really show up on the video, but it was raw cranberries in milk.  There are pieces of turkey in it.  I didn't have time to blend it up very much.  So it was just kind of like a chunky stew that just really smelled bad.  And she put it up to her lips, tasted it a little bit, and then put on a brave face.  She was professional, yeah.  Amazing. 
[00:26:30]  But have you thought these recipes through?  Because they don't sound like they're very tasty.  The answer is no.  These were basically the stupidest concepts you could come up with.  When you're blending up the leftovers and then you're pouring it into the milk container to save.  Yeah.  There's six meals in here.  Yeah, there's six meals in here.  And then you pour those blended up leftovers on your leftovers.  Right.  Oh, my gosh. 
[00:27:00]  You're cannibalizing your own leftovers.  That's great.  It's so gross.  At one point he said he had a charity and you could go and give your leftovers to participating Walmarts.  Like, your leftovers.  Half that shit has bites taken out of it.  That's disgusting.  And then he went on to say, believe it or not, guys, his last name is not really Gerky.  And now your last name is not Gerky.  It is not.  My full name's Nick Prewer.  But when I was growing up in Madison, Wisconsin, they had a thing called Madison's Most Wanted that would air on local TV. 
[00:27:30]  It was all the most wanted criminals in the area.  And we would sit around and watch the show at 2 in the morning on public access TV and record it and pick out our favorite criminals.  And my favorite guy was this guy named Keith Gerky, Keith R. Gerky.  And he was just kind of this mulleted man with a thin mustache.  I think it was in For Battery or something.  But he had such a great look. 
[00:28:00]  So we thought, let's pay tribute to him as a chef here.  See, I'm assuming, I bet all of us assumed that he just thought Gerky rhymes with turkey.  This is perfect.  But he was paying tribute to one of his favorite criminals.  Let's go to Jerome in Atlanta.  What's up, Jerome?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I just wanted to be talking about Jimmy.  Feeling that he might be able to murder somebody and everything lined up in the right place at the right time.  Yeah.  I just wanted to call in. 
[00:28:30]  I got four justifiable homicides on my record.  What?  Yes.  I was a bounty hunter for 15 years.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So in what context is it justifiable?  Well, when you start, I'm pretty much based out of Atlanta, Georgia.  And when you have the million-dollar bounties on these guys that you're trying to collect for your agency,  and everyone's pretty much strapped with some type of gun on them.  And when you're in and out of the slums of Atlanta for living 40, 60, 80 hours a week, 
[00:29:00]  you're bound to run into someone with a gun and doesn't like the fact that you're trying to apprehend them.  You still get the money if you shoot them?  Oh, yeah.  You know, insurance will take over that paperwork part.  But the big thing is just making sure you play yourself by making sure it's justifiable.  You can't just kick in the door and start shooting, so to speak.  Did it screw with your head the first time you had to kill somebody?  What's that?  Did it screw with your head the first time you had to kill somebody? 
[00:29:30]  I'm not going to sit here and try and tell you a tough guy.  Right.  It definitely did.  It definitely did.  But you know what?  I see them on me, and I've got to come home every night.  You know what I'm saying?  So what made you want to be a bounty hunter?  You know, it was kind of the right place at the right time.  Family, friends, set up a little agency.  I've always kind of pitched to the bounty security thing, and then they told me,  they kind of antagonized me with a little bit of cash.  I didn't think it was going to be as rough as it was.  But, yeah, it was definitely a different job. 
[00:30:00]  And do you look at Dog the Bounty Hunter as a complete joke?  Oh, absolutely.  It's never that smooth.  It's never that glamorous.  And then the whole, I've only seen, honestly, maybe one episode altogether.  I've seen bits and pieces.  But, yeah, then the whole, at the end of the episode, when he's having the prayer,  and I was giving my guy a cigarette, it's never like that.  Well, Jerome, I'm glad I have you on my side.  Absolutely.  Thanks for calling in, buddy.  No problem.  Keep killing the bad guys. 
[00:30:30]  Listen, big Opie and Anthony show today.  We'll get into everything we talked about.  Chelsea Handler on the show, and a whole lot more.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy are all in the house.  And if you don't believe me, stay tuned, because the Opie and Anthony show starts right now.  And if you don't believe me, stay tuned. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you. 
[00:36:00]  Just biding our time.  Because we're on our way out.  Is that it?  We're on our last leg.  Is that it?  Limping to the finish line.  What happened?  Losing audience by the day.  I wish we were extreme.  That'd be the fucking best.  You know, what can I tell you.  I'm going to tattoo the shit out of my body.  I'm going to tattoo the shit out of my body. 
[00:36:30]  Then I'll be all right.  Then I'll be good.  fucking habit.  I turn the fucking habit.  We're going to do it.  I see.  We're going to do it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like radio guys.  For the most part.  They're all two-faced fucking assholes, to be honest with you.  Them suck ass.  I got a short list.  I like Ron.  Ronnie B.  And then there's Brother Weez.  Brother Weez.  My mentor. 
[00:37:00]  Then you got Anthony and Jimmy.  We got some of the other radio guys we got.  Ant and Jimmy.  Jimmy Nye.  No, he's still stuck on Ron and Weez.  I kind of like Scott Shannon these days.  Cowhead?  I don't know who this cowhead is.  I don't know who the fuck that is either.  Why does the name keep coming up?  I know we've seen him.  He came in here.  But I never heard him.  And supposedly we took a picture with the guy.  Something like that.  He's a radio friend. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Radio friend.  Well, introduce me.  And then, you know, maybe we can hit it off.  I'm a moron.  We did.  Radio friend.  What, once?  I was distracted that day, I guess.  Right?  We met him more than once.  Who else do we like?  I like B.J. Shea.  You guys don't know much about him.  Although he did a little time at N.E.W.  But the sports guys sabotaged him.  Oh, yeah?  Those motherfuckers.  Yeah, they did.  And what happened?  We brought in Brian, B.J. Shea, to help their show out a little bit.  And they sabotaged him.  B.J. Shea.  They didn't want anything to do with B.J. Shea, who's a very good broadcaster out there in Seattle. 
[00:38:00]  No hat.  The rover dude is all right.  Mr. Imus.  Uh, Mr. Imus is I.  Do I, Don Imus.  But we don't hang out with any of these guys.  No.  As soon as you start hanging out with anybody, they just fucking turn on you.  Who else?  So you guys don't know some of the guys that have met on the way out.  Phil Hendry.  I never spoke with Phil Hendry.  I haven't officially spoke with Phil Hendry, but we're palsy-wowsies on the Twitter.  I don't think he's a war guy either. 
[00:38:30]  Like, I don't think he's ever brought anything up.  He is absolutely, uh...  Good guy.  The word brilliant is used too much, but Phil Hendry is brilliant.  No, tell me about it.  Anthony Comia.  Brilliant.  That's terrible.  Phil Hendry is brilliant at what he does.  Phil Hendry.  Hey, Hendry.  And he's my Twitter pal, but we've never spoken.  But he retweets a lot of my stuff, and it's just cool in general.  But there are plenty of people that are fucking assholes.  Well, you know, I mean, we've had a good run. 
[00:39:00]  We've got to shut this thing down, obviously.  The signs are all around us.  It's so obvious.  Is that what it is?  And other broadcasters are picking up on that fact.  So, what are you going to do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  I'd love to play all coy and everything.  What?  I'd love to play all coy and everything.  What do you mean?  Ugh.  Look, uh, you know, all the radio guys have every right to think they're the best, of course. 
[00:39:30]  Uh-huh.  We've never said we're the best, by the way.  We're the best around.  Instead of saying you're the best, you just gotta do.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta do.  Day in and day out.  You just keep doing.  And then it's up to these assholes listening to our voices if we're the best or not.  Well, let me just lay something out there.  Jason Ellis is a cunt.  Wow.  He's a little fucking cunt.  Wow.  Are you a little old to be extreme, dude?  What are you, a skateboarder? 
[00:40:00]  Fuck this cocksucker.  Fuck him.  What happened?  With his prison tats.  What the fuck?  Fuck this guy.  I've never liked him.  He's come on our show.  He's come on our show.  And whoa, look out.  What'd you do?  You ran down the street with your pants down.  Wow.  When did that happen?  What?  Whenever.  Oh.  What a little dick bag.  But he has every right to think he's the best. 
[00:40:30]  I don't have a problem with that.  He stinks.  He stinks on ice.  I think he said he's the best show at SiriusXM.  Well, congratulations.  I called him out on that.  Congrats.  I called him out on that on my Twitter, OP Radio.  I wouldn't put him better than 80s on 8, quite frankly.  I'd rather listen to Aha.  But, you know, some of his listeners, the four that got a hold of me, they said, look, you  know, what, are you jealous?  Of course he's going to say he's the best. 
[00:41:00]  I said, I have no problem with anyone saying they're the best at something, but it's kind  of silly.  It's silly.  Here's me riding a bicycle.  Look at me.  I'll spin the handlebars.  Did you?  Wow.  Are you 45 on a pogo stick?  Fuck him.  He's not really that much younger than us, but he gives the impression that he might be  a lot younger than us.  Enough of him.  What was he saying?  What's the fucking...  Yeah, we got the clip from...  What's the word?  From Rover.  Tired of him. 
[00:41:30]  Enough of fucking...  Jason Ellis.  Look, I was the one that brought Jason Ellis to our channel and to everyone's attention  around here.  He's extreme, are you?  My thoughts were very simple on it.  I heard Jason Ellis' show a few years ago, and I go, wow, this guy has potential.  And I swear to you, this is what I thought at the time.  I thought he had potential.  Yeah.  I thought that we should give him a shot on our channel.  I thought that his audience is a little different than ours, and maybe we could grow our audience 
[00:42:00]  through having these other shows on.  Yeah.  And I swear, this is the God's honest truth, because if he wants to talk real, I could  talk real.  The show has not grown one iota since the day I heard it for the first time, when I heard  that this guy has potential.  Come on, it took us a good six to eight months before we took off in Boston.  And in all fairness, you guys didn't want him on the channel, and I pushed hard, and 
[00:42:30]  I got it done, and in the end, I was wrong.  No problem.  You guys never liked him.  The audience fucking hated the show on our channel.  They just hated it.  And we had to move on from that, period.  You know?  But I was friendly with the guy.  But he doesn't really understand how to work this business whatsoever.  We were the only one that gave him a shot at SiriusXM, but he continued to kiss Howard's  ass, like Howard's going to pay attention to him.  He made a rookie mistake. 
[00:43:00]  How many people are going to do that?  Let me help everyone out there.  Jenny Hutt does it, and I could give you a whole list of people.  They all kiss Howard Stern's ass, thinking Howard's going to turn around and do this  amazing thing for them.  Going to boost them up to fame and fortune.  And when these broadcasters do this, I get douche chills, because the one thing you need  to know about Howard Stern, he don't give a fuck about anyone, including his own staff.  And that's his thing, and whatever, it works for him.  Whatever.  But when you're a radio person, and you go and kiss his ass, and kiss his ass on Twitter, 
[00:43:30]  and kiss his ass on your radio show, it's embarrassing.  Name one guy in all the years that he's taken under his wing and launched to stardom.  There isn't one.  Not one.  So why the fuck would you kiss his ass?  Not one, but they continue to do it, and they look like complete idiots.  Like a douche.  I just didn't like when he...  Hey, look, you can mention who you want in your book and stuff.  That's fair. 
[00:44:00]  But it's like, how do you not thank O&A?  It's like, no one cares if you go on Howard's show first.  Like, we're not dicks about that.  This show is not like, you gotta come on.  We get it.  Yeah, hey, go on that show first.  Come over.  But it was always that after a while, and then it was not even thanking you guys.  It's like, eh, come on, man.  Whatever.  A lot of people on the radio don't show any loyalty to people who are pretty good to them.  Yeah, that's why I really...  I truly hate this business.  I like what we do, but I hate the business that we're in.  Because it's a whole bunch of backstabbers, two-faced dicks, you know. 
[00:44:30]  He should have...  Yeah, it would have been nice if he thanked us in his book, but he didn't.  Whatever.  I'm not going to lose sleep over that.  I didn't even know he had a book.  And I'm being...  I will swear on my family I didn't know he had a book.  It goes back to my point.  He thanks Howard.  He kisses Howard's ass.  Jason Howard, don't give a fuck about you, you stupid fuck.  I thought you were extreme.  You don't even understand that.  Yeah.  You don't give a fuck.  Jenny Hutt, Howard Stern, don't give a fuck about you.  Stop embarrassing yourself. 
[00:45:00]  I kind of want to see her naked.  Jenny Hutt.  I would rather see Jason naked.  Yeah?  Yes.  I don't know.  That Instagram or...  No, the Twitter pic of her.  Like she's squatting down.  I kind of want to see that fucking...  That fiery red box.  You know what?  I would like to see that fiery red box as well.  I just want to see it.  I have to agree.  I bet it's fucking interesting looking.  I guarantee that she's a wrinkled mess.  Look.  A wrinkled mess from her armpits all the way down to her knees.  With her Al Pacino shoes. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, what is she fucking...  She's in Neil Armstrong's house.  She looks good in that picture.  She looks good in that picture.  She looks good on CNN.  I don't know.  She's just needy though.  She's a nice person and all, but you know, she's another one that makes that dumb mistake.  What a love-hate relationship I have with her.  Can't stand her, but I kind of want to see her naked.  So, I mean...  There's something going on there.  So we moved on from Jason.  It just didn't work out.  I didn't see the show growing whatsoever.  I don't see it. 
[00:46:00]  It hasn't grown since the first time I listened to it.  Zero buzz.  Zero.  And in the end, I was completely wrong,  but I thought it was worth giving it a shot.  These guys didn't like him at all since day one.  I kind of did like him.  And then, you know, I just saw that the show wasn't growing.  And then I also saw that he was just kind of a dick to us.  He's an asshole.  It was so obvious.  He's a fucking asshole.  You know, he came in here like he was some kind of alpha male.  And I think Jim Jeffries put him in his place pretty good.  And others were just like, really? 
[00:46:30]  You're going to be extreme in front of us, I guess?  I was dicked in the ass when I was a child.  Were you?  Yeah.  Blow me.  Get the fuck out of here.  So I guess he was on Robert's show.  You're talking to me?  Yeah.  Sorry.  He was on Robert's.  There's a mirror in front of me.  He was on Robert's show in Cleveland and had this to say.  There's a lot of different people that have gotten smaller gigs on Sirius.  And the overriding thing is, they don't pay diddly squat.  Unless your name is Howard Stern or maybe Opie and Anthony, you're not making any money 
[00:47:00]  at this place.  But you've been working there a few years.  Are they paying you pretty well up there?  Yeah.  I mean, my contract's actually up real soon.  And being a New York Times bestseller and all the other stuff that I'm getting, my show's  bigger than Opie and Anthony's already.  See, and then this is why these guys are fucking...  You want me to show you the numbers?  I've seen some of the numbers, Jason.  Your show's not even close to bigger than ours.  Boniness. 
[00:47:30]  But these guys could spew bullshit out there.  Is it?  Is it bigger than ONA's, really?  It's not even close, so why are you saying that?  Not the least bit close.  You're one show on, I swear, I don't know, Faction, I think.  Who knows?  You're one show on Faction.  We have a whole fucking channel.  You're not even close to bigger than ours, so why are you lying?  Have you ever heard a buzz around his show?  Have you ever seen any social media that's clamored about anything this fucking useless  cunt has fucking said? 
[00:48:00]  That's literally like me being on a show and someone mentioning a comic and going,  well, I'm bigger than him already.  Right, right.  It wouldn't occur to me to say that.  How do you even say that?  It's embarrassing.  You're not bigger than this show.  Do you want to be bigger than this show someday?  Okay, that's cool.  You should say that.  There's nothing wrong with that, but don't fucking lie.  It's not even close.  Not even.  Not even close.  Being a New York Times bestseller and all the other stuff that I'm getting,  and my show's bigger than Opie and Anthony's already.  We're on a music channel in the afternoons. 
[00:48:30]  So it's only a matter of time before I'm bigger than all of those guys.  And serious, no, I mean, those guys are on their way out.  I just started, and my family just started.  First of all, we're not on our way out.  Another lie.  And you didn't just start.  You were on our channel years ago.  You didn't just start.  You know what, man?  That really fucking, because he's not joking around and being funny.  He's saying for real, like, hey, I'm better than these guys, 
[00:49:00]  and they're on their way out.  And they treated you really nice, man.  And it's one thing I've been, since I've started this shit,  is fucking loyal.  And you don't have to go on and rave about Opie and Anthony,  but to kind of go on and then subtly throw a little motherfucker  at the guys that treated you nicely  before anybody else around here treated you nicely  is kind of a dick fucking move.  And you don't have to motherfuck Howard.  Fine, don't.  But that's a real dick move to go on and shit on the guys  that fucking treated you nicely  before anybody around here treated you nice.  Opie had you put on this fucking channel. 
[00:49:30]  And it doesn't mean you have to go around the rest of your career  raving and ranting about Opie and Anthony,  but you don't have to go out of your way  to kind of be a dick on a radio show about the Opie and Anthony.  There's no reason for it.  You fucking play games like that.  You arthritic fucking knees, and you're acting like a kid.  Shut up, you little fuckwad.  And he says we're on our way out, and he just started.  I've just been informed, because I really didn't know this.  Yeah.  He's been here nine years.  Is it nine years?  I just started.  How is that just starting?  Did ya?  Yeah, he started 2005. 
[00:50:00]  Did ya?  Nine years.  Me and Anna have only done 20.  Come on.  Come on.  You've done half that already.  That's nine years here.  Is that nine years here?  What did he do before?  That's nine years for the Jason Ollis show.  Never.  That was his first radio show.  You know what we accomplished nine years in?  Are you kidding me?  You're not even close, Jason.  That's like me and Sam saying we just started with you guys.  Right.  Just stop already.  More lies.  Motherfucking phony cunt.  But radio guys love just fucking lying.  Just lying through their fucking teeth. 
[00:50:30]  What an honest fucking bone.  Supposedly Howard said he doesn't stop other guests from going on other radio shows.  Just another liar.  Yeah, fucking.  Just another liar.  Good luck with that.  We've had so many guests tell us when the mics are off what the shit that goes on.  Yeah.  But just another liar.  This business is just filled with liars.  God.  I just started and my fan base is getting bigger by the second. 
[00:51:00]  Is it?  So.  Really?  I'm not sweating that at all.  You know, I'm appreciative of what those guys have done in their careers.  But I know it's serious.  I don't bother about that anymore because it's such a drama.  I just, I'm just like, what do I do Monday to Friday?  Am I the best guy on satellite radio?  To me, I am.  All right.  That's fine.  And you can think that.  Yeah, you should think that actually.  Because they're really dumb people on Twitter.  They're like, you shouldn't have a problem with him thinking that. 
[00:51:30]  I don't.  Yeah.  I don't, you idiot.  You actually should think that about your own show.  Of course you should think that.  Watch how fucking big you are, Jason.  Just watch.  As you get trashed from our fucking freaks.  Our boneheads will trash you.  Fucking dickbags.  Just enough already.  I've been annoyed with that cocksucker for years. 
[00:52:00]  It's enough of him.  Another phony load of shit.  God.  It's not phony.  He's got the, he's got the teardrop.  Oh, yeah.  It's teardrop fucking tab.  Look out.  Look out.  It's just the two-faced shit that drives me nuts.  We were at Metallica.  He came up to me.  Like, hey, man, we're good, right?  We're good, right?  I'm like, yeah, we're good.  Whatever.  It didn't work out between, you know, your show on our channel.  But I don't even think about it yet. 
[00:52:30]  But he came right up to me.  Like, you're sure?  We're good, right?  We're good.  I'm like, yeah.  I haven't said a bad word about you on the show or anything.  I actually.  But then he takes these little jabs.  I'm like, which guy is it?  You might as well tattoo a big fucking two on the front of your face.  Tattooed hair on his head.  It's a two-faced joke.  Thank you.  Oh.  Big, a big.  Two-face.  A big two on the front of your face.  I didn't recognize Metallica.  Like, I saw him, and I didn't say anything.  I honestly didn't recognize him at first. 
[00:53:00]  And then I think he said hello, and then I was like, oh.  But I walked right by him.  I just didn't recognize him.  Did you think that Bam Bam Bigelow was on a diet?  I love it.  When someone gets that many tattoos, sorry to the people that listen to our show that have  a lot of tattoos, but when you get that many tattoos, there's something going on.  You're hiding something.  Trying something.  You're covering up something. 
[00:53:30]  You could get a couple here and there, but when you go all in with tattoos, man, you are  fucking trying to fucking make something go away.  And by the way, if you go on a terrestrial radio show, and you don't think that you're  motherfucking the show by saying that, yeah, those guys are on their way out, you just  go on to a regular radio show, and for no reason, saying that basically this show is  finished, what do you expect the reaction to be?  You're not going to rationalize your way out of this, or an excuse of, oh, what I meant  was, fuck you.  You're done.  That really fucking irritates me. 
[00:54:00]  Like, what, we're all done now?  Yeah, we're done.  And you're not new.  You've been out at nine years.  You should have had your own channel by now.  What do you think?  You're a fresh-faced kid like fucking Sam Roberts?  Like young Sam Roberts on his way up?  There's a man that's on his way up, making shit money.  Oh, man.  Crazy.  Nine years is a long time in radio.  Yeah.  You're not the new kid in town.  If you're not already up, or have been up in nine years, eh, be happy where you are. 
[00:54:30]  Stop fucking bad-mouthing people that have accomplished something.  Well, that treated you good.  And tried to help you out.  And treated you good.  What the fuck, man?  People that treated you nicely.  Don't motherfuck them on the regular radio.  On terrestrial radio.  It's a dick move.  We didn't say anything bad about that cunt.  It's a long list of people that we try to help over the years, and then they turn around  and just fuck us over.  People that have worked here.  Other radio people that we brought into our fold to help grow their shows. 
[00:55:00]  Remember Scott Farrell?  Wow.  We were pals with that guy.  It is.  As I sit here, I don't have an issue with him, because I don't think about him.  But if we're bringing up this topic.  And the first chance he got, he trashes us.  Because he's another guy that thought if he trashed us, Howard would fucking open up the golden gates  and give him this amazing radio career.  And once again, Howard Stern didn't give a fuck about Scott Farrell  and didn't give a fuck about what Scott Farrell said about us. 
[00:55:30]  He'll give you nothing.  Nothing.  To this day, I can't believe that went down.  We were so cool to Scott Farrell.  This guy was in a bad place in his life.  I mean, it's up to him to talk about that shit.  But he was in a really bad place.  And we helped him as much as we could.  And the people around us, we thought he was a talent.  And we got along.  And he broadcasted some of those softball games and came on our show.  We thought we were friends with him.  Next thing you know, he's on, I forgot what website, just completely trashing us. 
[00:56:00]  Trashing us.  Could you explain to me what went wrong that you're now doing this?  Kissing Howie's ass.  Howie won't do anything for anybody except Howie.  And then, what are we supposed to do?  Oh, fuck that.  All a bunch of dickbags.  It's unbelievable.  And people that we've had on the show.  Nothing makes me happier than when people listen to their cunt publicist.  And they just, well, let's give the exclusive.  And then they try to get back on. 
[00:56:30]  And they always try to get back on.  They always try.  And we go, no.  Go fuck yourself.  Tracy Morgan's the latest.  And I'll say it again.  I like Tracy a lot.  But he did us wrong, period.  Seven years on 30 Rock.  Didn't come in here once.  And then the show's off the air.  All of a sudden, we got calls from Tracy Morgan.  He wants to come on to promote Caroline's.  I'm like, what?  What are you talking about?  And he used to do the show before that on a regular basis.  Another guy that was at our softball games back in the day. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, you can think you're the best.  That's fine.  I think I should be fucking hosting the Tonight Show.  Hey, come on.  I really do.  I believe that in my fucking soul.  But tonight's show starring Greg Opie Hughes.  So it's okay to believe in stuff and believe you're the best.  But to give us the little fucking...  On our way out, are we?  The little trash, you know, trashing us like that subtly.  I'm already bigger than those guys.  I'm on the way up. 
[00:57:30]  You're not.  You're not even close.  You're not some fresh-faced kid new in the business.  You're embarrassing.  Going on the fucking air and trying to sound like you're the new kid in town.  It's embarrassing.  You fucking piece of shit.  Stop it already.  On our way up.  Are you?  Nine years in.  How long is it going to take?  Nine years in?  That's a big fucking ladder you're climbing then.  Nine years in.  Nine years.  Make him believe you're the new guy. 
[00:58:00]  Nine years is a long time, bro.  There you go.  The new kid.  Stop it.  You got gray hairs on your skateboard.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, Christ.  You're so extreme.  What are you doing?  Look out.  He's a wild man.  Whoa.  Look out.  Stop it.  Does AARP have a fucking bungee jumping plan?  You fucking. 
[00:58:30]  You're an old dude.  Stop already.  Stop.  This business just has a lot of shitty people in it.  What a bunch of dickbags.  Just shitty, unloyalty, not loyal, two-faced.  Stop it.  Even when you're trying to help someone out.  You try to help.  Holy fuck.  Who cares?  Pat it.  I pushed you, Jason, on this show.  These guys never liked you.  I was like, all right.  I think this show has potential.  And I'll say it again.  It hasn't grown since the first time I listened to it. 
[00:59:00]  I can't even tell you how many times I glanced down at Pal Talk here while he was on, babbling  about something, and just read just contempt, just fucking venom from the people listening  to him.  And I'm sitting here fucking rolling my eyes like, how do we cut him off?  Going off of one of his bullshit stories about how fucking crazy he is.  Just stop already.  Stop it.  Ugh. 
[00:59:30]  I don't think one goes here.  Oh.  Someone's going to get that.  Later.  That's what you do when you're on your way out.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you're on your way out.  Shut up.  Hey, man.  You know, we're all on our way out, trust me.  Yeah, exactly.  This is going to happen to everybody.  The second you're in, you're on your way out with anything.  It's just a matter of holding on.  Hold on for dear life.  Believe me.  I've had my fucking fingernails dug into the wall for the, how many years since this fucking 
[01:00:00]  hostile ass raping merger?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Every contract, I think I'm finished.  Yeah.  According to Ellis' Facebook page, you guys have been crying for 30 minutes.  Crying?  No, we're just crying.  Have we been crying?  We're just addressing the situation at hand.  I think, uh, I think Jason's been crying, quite literally. 
[01:00:30]  We've heard that.  Just more lies.  See, now it'll be perceived that we're crying.  Just whatever.  See what I mean?  Just more lies.  Is this crying?  It's addressing your bullshit.  Just more lies.  Dumb fuck.  It's addressing your bullshit.  How is that crying?  Uh, just more, just more lies.  Bullshit.  Shut up.  What have you done?  I'll just say, I'm just completely, uh, you know, in the end, just completely disappointed.  That's all. 
[01:01:00]  We gave you a nice break.  Look at him.  A really nice opportunity.  What is that fucking photo with some chicks?  Really?  You're on there with some chicks?  Fucking God.  What a fake load of shit this guy is.  Everything's a gimmick.  Every fucking thing in your career is a gimmick.  Not one honest bone in your body.  Fuck off, dickhead.  Fuck off.  Look at him.  Got my sunglasses on, cause I'm cool. 
[01:01:30]  Shut it.  How about one real fucking, yeah, one real moment, you sleeved cunt.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Enough.  Oh, boy.  I see some photos starting on his Facebook page.  What a fucking curly-haired idiot Voss was.  Oh, Voss was a dickbag.  Look at him.  Oh, enough.  Look at me.  I'm on my Facebook with girls. 
[01:02:00]  Are ya?  Wow.  Look out.  You're too cool.  Ugh.  God, I can't stand these phonies.  Everything's a gimmick and a work.  Not one honest fucking minute in his whole life.  Please.  Gonna try to talk smack on some radio show. 
[01:02:30]  Make it seem like you're on your way up.  Oh, that's not nice at all.  Seems like a big ass squeezing some banana-looking shit out.  Obi, what are you doing in that photo?  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  Oh.  Trying to figure out why there are so many weird photos on his Facebook page.  Yeah.  I figured it out, though.  This comment says it all.  Yeah.  Scott Shannon sent us to destroy you.  Well, who thought we'd ever see that? 
[01:03:00]  Enough.  Good.  Godspeed there, Jason Ellis.  Have fun.  Have fun on the way up.  Just don't fucking lie.  That's my point today.  That's it.  Just stop lying.  You're not the new kid in town.  You've been out at nine years.  New kid.  New fresh-faced kid.  And your show is absolutely not bigger than ours.  It's not even close, okay?  It's not even close.  First of all, you've got to run your own channel.  You've got to do that first.  Yeah, how about that? 
[01:03:30]  No?  What?  You know, we've been running our own channel for pretty much the whole time, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  When we first got here, we weren't on it.  It was our channel.  They just called it something different, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The virus.  He's an aside on some channel that if he disappeared tomorrow, no one would notice or give a shit.  Just get your...  And that's the truth.  Get your own channel done.  Yeah.  Look, I'll help you out again.  Get your own channel done, and then grow from there, and then maybe someday you will be bigger than us.  Maybe.  Hey, give it a whirl. 
[01:04:00]  Go ahead.  But you're not bigger than us now.  You're not even close.  It's not even close.  The listenership just ain't there, pally.  Oh, enough.  And Rover, if anyone had reason to...  Rover's on terrestrial radio.  Yeah, yeah.  If anyone was going to motherfuck the show subtly, it should have been Rover, because, like, satellite is the enemy of regular radio.  He was at least honest.  He was talking about, you know, people here that are making money.  It's pretty much our nuts.  That's it.  Oh.  Good luck.  You guys make good money? 
[01:04:30]  You know what?  We should be making a fuckload more.  Yeah, that's the truth.  But we have a good life.  But it ain't bad.  Making a good living.  I'll tell you one thing.  It's a lot more than Jason Elvis is fucking pulling in.  And Rover had no problem being honest about it.  He's right.  People don't make money here.  There's a few shows.  That's it.  You know, I'm...  You think Jason Ellis is going to demand money and get it here?  For what?  What have you proven?  I'm fighting right now to save Dr. Steve's show, because they've told me they can't afford his salary. 
[01:05:00]  And I have to say, it's going to embarrass Dr. Steve a little bit.  He's only making $150 a show.  Oh, my God.  And they came to me the other day and said, we've got to, like, cut him down to once a month.  I got that done, I think.  That's Pennywise and Dollar Foolish.  I think I got that one done.  Dollarwise and Penny Foolish?  Well...  But it should be brought up today because of what Rover said.  So Rover's not lying.  I mean, most of these guys are pretty much doing radio for free, because when you start 
[01:05:30]  figuring out what it costs to put a radio show on, what it costs to commute to SiriusXM...  Jenny Hutts, another one.  She makes absolutely no money to do a radio show here.  And I know a few other guys that don't want to be named, because they asked me not to, because  they're a little embarrassed about it.  But there's other people.  Yeah.  They literally make about $100 a show.  Yeah.  So, you know, Rover tells the truth.  He was telling the truth.  That's actually...  You actually...  When you said Dr. Steve made $150 a show, that's actually three times more than I thought 
[01:06:00]  he made.  But I was hoping to get, you know, Dr. Steve a little, like, raise by now.  Yeah, yeah.  They come to me and tell me that we don't have any money left in the budget.  Yeah.  And it drives me nuts, and you know why.  Because all the money goes to somebody else.  Yeah.  Just funnels down the hall.  For what, in the end?  I don't know.  For what?  Amazing. 
[01:06:30]  Tell me for what?  Show me.  That giving one guy all that money is worth it.  Show me.  Please.  Shut my mouth.  I would love to have my mouth shut by actual facts and numbers.  Here it is.  If they went, here you go.  Right.  Boom.  This is why.  And I have that, oh my God.  Wow.  That's why I see now.  Then I would shut my cake horn.  Shut that cake horn.  I would shut my cake horn immediately.  Cake horn. 
[01:07:00]  Show me.  I beg you.  Because I just know it doesn't add up.  Yeah.  I've been around long enough to know it just doesn't add up.  You meant $150,000 for Dr. Steve, right?  Mm-hmm.  No?  $150.  It's literally $150.  And they were going to get rid of it.  What is this?  The $1,800?  Like, who makes that for anything?  If you heard my phone call the other night, I don't yell as much these days. 
[01:07:30]  But man, I fucking, I was, I was, wow.  I wound up.  Do you understand this guy worked for free for three years for us?  This show was on for three years and he didn't get a penny.  Plus they own him.  Oh, God.  They own him.  They own his name.  They own all this stuff.  They have the balls to own your likeness and pay you $150 a show.  Poor guy changes bed pants for the nearly dead.  Just wants to do a little radio show. 
[01:08:00]  I think that's why Kevin Smith isn't on because they wanted to own his content.  He was like, no.  And Bill Burr, too.  Burr, too.  Why would they, why should they let you own the content?  You lease it.  The only, Bill, you know, had a heart to heart with me basically saying, look, man, no.  You know, I don't do things for free anymore.  I think, uh, I think Sirius, yeah.  And I don't blame him.  I think Sirius is responsible for a bunch of good, uh, podcasts.  Right.  Because they, they made other people go to other places and, and make their own podcasts. 
[01:08:30]  You know how great it would be to have Bill Burr's podcast on this channel every, every week?  Brilliant.  It would be great.  Yeah.  But he said, look, I don't do things for free anymore.  No.  I don't blame him.  But they basically want stuff for free.  Yeah.  It's content.  And they want to own it.  And they want to own it.  It's like, it's just not realistic.  They want to own it right till they kick your ass out the fucking door.  Right.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  So, there you go.  There you go. 
[01:09:00]  Bigger than us.  Have fun.  I'll have fun with us.  Whatever.  Have fun.  But don't lie.  Yeah.  You know, the lying is just.  That's a nice coat.  Ooh.  Very nice.  Thank you.  The lying is what just drives me nuts.  Not the most chatty we've ever had.  Very nervous.  Very nervous.  Why is she so rude?  She's so rude.  She's very rude.  She's very rude.  We have a reputation, guys.  What it is.  Why don't you understand? 
[01:09:30]  But I'm always nice to her.  We were good Jackie and Sidney.  We were very nice to that.  That's what I mean.  We have a reputation.  I always wink.  I hike up my pants in the front.  Show off what I have.  I fucking rolled up sock.  Yeah, I'm ugly.  What are you going to do?  All right.  So that's that.  That is that, huh?  I'm pretty amazed by that backstabbing yesterday.  Fuck him.  Another one.  Pretty rasshole.  Like I said, you know, if you want to think you're the best, of course.  Everyone should think that. 
[01:10:00]  But to take those little, like, shots at us after you know what we try to do for you,  that's just like, that's just not, that's, you know, when they talk about karma, there  you go.  That's, that's real fucking karma there.  And we've dealt with these people already.  That's just bad, dude.  You might have to go back to therapy or something, because we, we were the only ones here that  really gave you a solid fucking shot to grow your audience.  Howard didn't give a fuck about you.  What the fuck do you think we were doing, having you on our show?  Right.  Like, we needed Jason Ellis on our fucking show? 
[01:10:30]  On the channel.  The show was on the channel.  Doing you a favor.  Fucking asshole.  Another dick.  Another phony cunt bag.  Ugh.  We've dealt with so many of these guys.  Yeah.  In our careers.  So it's like, he's just another one in the pile of shit.  Because I think, I think this business just attracts, like, yeah, like, douchebags.  Crazy people.  And if you have no self-confidence in what you do, you just lash out like that. 
[01:11:00]  It's, it's the truth.  You just lash out.  Grabbing at straws.  On your way up, are you?  Good luck with that.  Nine years on your way up.  That's the extended plan he's taking on his way up.  Don't say you're the new guy if you've been out in nine years.  Nine years in radio is a long time.  Most guys don't get to do nine years.  Nine years.  That's a career for pretty much every radio guy.  You better have fucking made a name for yourself in nine years already. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  But to say your show's already bigger, when the facts prove that that's not even close  to true.  It's not true.  Just do your, just do your shows and don't lie about it.  I'd wager anything.  If he could come up with any proof that shows he is more popular in any way, shape, or form  than this show, I will fucking wager anything.  Name it.  Name it.  I'm on it.  Even if you think that, who says that about people that are supposed to be their friends? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like, it's literally, in all the radio interviews I've ever done, it has never occurred to me  to say I'm bigger than, like, somebody who's supposed to be a friend of mine, or an acquaintance  that's casually pleasant.  It has never occurred to me to fucking say that once in an interview.  That's no surprise.  Tell me.  It's happened to me many times.  People are just, people are just not right.  I'm not surprised when it happens anymore. 
[01:12:30]  I'm disappointed over and over again, because, you know, it's like, seriously?  Another asshole.  Just another one.  Why don't we take a break, because we're going to move on to something else that happened  yesterday, which was pretty interesting.  Can I guess what it is?  I think I know.  Yes.  It's really good news.  It's American Degenerate is now available for download for $5 on my website.  So all the people in Canada, and I've gotten all these emails from England and from Australia  or whatever, you can now buy it for $5 on my website. 
[01:13:00]  There you go.  Oh, my God.  That's going to be a payday for you.  I hope so, because I get enough emails from people.  Unless it's one guy under fucking 200 accounts, which it probably is.  Do we get a little taste of that?  You do.  Yes.  You can buy the video for $5, the audio for $5.  We're both for $8.  Holy crap.  You're going to have a nice payday.  Eight clams.  Not bad, huh?  How do I not want to see the numbers?  Clams.  Oh, come now.  No.  We all think we can do it since Louis did it, and it's been a steady fucking nosedive 
[01:13:30]  since.  I'll make fucking four grand off this.  No.  No.  You're going to do very well.  That's very cool.  And supposedly Epix is going to be on Time Warner.  I've heard that.  Yeah, I hope so.  That's big.  Epix is just exploding.  I love Epix.  They won't confirm it.  Oh, wait.  Aren't they on Time Warner?  Are they on?  No.  They're on Fios.  Time Warner Cable strikes deal with Epix.  Yeah, I can't get Epix here in Manhattan.  Oh, good.  So that's great.  That's great news for them.  Yeah, I think they're on DirecTV now.  They've gotten a lot of... 
[01:14:00]  I watch Epix a lot on Fios.  Definitely.  Well, the documentaries are phenomenal.  Yes, and they've got a lot of them.  Did you see the one on...  Who's the fucking writer?  John Amelius?  Yes.  Amazing.  Who knew?  Yeah.  Who knew that guy was in everything?  That was a good one, yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break, and we're going to get into the Jesse Ventura thing.  He did an AMA yesterday.  Did he?  And it was pretty much hijacked by the knuckleheads.  I saw a screencast.  The knuckleheads.  Lyle Chipperson had a question for him. 
[01:14:30]  Did he?  Yeah.  That's great.  I joined the Taliban, according to AMA.  The Reddit AMA with Jesse Ventura.  So, do we have that all organized?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Nice.  We'll get into that next.  Stay there.  Hello, this is Ricky Gervais.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be back after a short break.  If they really need a break, I mean, they're sitting down, talking.  Sometimes not talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have a break, guys.  See you soon.

Uh, like, oh my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley, and in the valley, we don't take guff.

And so I said, well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  And so I said to him, I said, bring back the music.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth. 
[01:25:00]  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking, don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him, I said, wait a minute.  I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts.  And so I said to him, I said, you all talk a big thing.  You only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.

[01:26:00]  Very nice.  Love this song.  This was a big hit, yeah.  It certainly was, yeah.  Big video where he was releasing doves.  That was Ozzy's like 84.  He had like the frosted hair.  Very 80s.  And the video, he's kind of walking around like this white sequined gown.  His hair looked like one of the golden girls.  Yeah, it was a little Bette Midler-ish.  But you know what?  Fuck it.  He went with it and he survived the 80s.  Well done.  The Osbournes premiered on MTV 14 years ago. 
[01:26:30]  Holy fuck.  14 years ago.  14 years ago.  Unbelievable.  That's crazy.  John Belushi found dead 32 years ago.  Oh my God.  At the age of 33.  He looks so much older than 33.  He was only 33.  He would be 65.  That's it.  He's been dead most of our lives.  Well, I shouldn't say most of our lives, but a lot of our lives.  And he would only be 65.  That's it.  Jesus.  And I want to say happy birthday to one of our pals. 
[01:27:00]  Someone that is absolutely loyal to us.  Penn Jillette.  Oh, yeah.  Who's 59 today.  I thought he was younger.  I figure he's that old because we've been seeing him since the 80s.  But he doesn't look that old.  Yeah.  I had to put him at younger than that.  Yeah.  I would have said he's like 58.  57.  I would have said younger.  Penn Jillette.  Happy birthday.  Not a real friend.  Not many real friends in this business, unfortunately. 
[01:27:30]  You got the Joe Rogan.  You got the Penn Jillette.  You got the Bill Burr.  You got like Voss and Bobby.  You should know.  What happened?  During the break?  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone wanted me to make sure that you knew.  Jesus.  He would always be loyal to the Joe Rogan.  Oh, that's good.  We don't have to worry about him.  He's a fresh-faced kid on his way up, right?  Yeah.  Like fucking Jason.  Fresh-faced.  There's a new killing child.  And he's looking good. 
[01:28:00]  Fresh frackle face in the name.  There's a new killing child.  You didn't like that song?  Hated it.  You're dating yourself, though, man.  We got to make believe we're younger than we are.  Oh, that's right.  We probably shouldn't have played Ozzy.  Right.  That's dated, too.  We got to be a little more extreme, brother.  Let me just check my Twitter feed and see.  The one fucking plug I need to go out for my thing on the side, it doesn't go out. 
[01:28:30]  I send it.  It just goes away.  Where does it go?  Is it the back of my phone and just fucking hide?  Cunt Twitter?  Yeah, it is.  Nah, why would it be?  Why would it be?  Good.  Big premiere.  Oh, fucking shithead.  I'm such a not-a-machine in this business.  Oh, Jimmy.  We disappear.  It disappears.  What a fucking cock-sucking fool.  It's podcast day, too. 
[01:29:00]  Don't forget.  Go through iTunes if you can so we could, you know, have some bragging rights among the other  podcasters.  Put up some numbers.  What do we got this week?  I know what we got, but why don't you tell them, Sammy?  Well, since Scarlett Johansson is-  So Scarlett Johansson is pregnant now.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Five months pregnant.  We look back on September 14th.  Let me tell you something.  That was the day the naked pictures were released. 
[01:29:30]  Yes, it was the very first time it changed to all of us.  Sorry, I can't repeat.  Keith Robinson's obsessed with her.  And we were talking about it the other night at the thing.  And I showed him the picture of her ass.  In the mirror?  Yeah, and his fucking gut response was so...  It would get me fired to say it, but it was fucking hilarious.  Can you write it down?  Was it racial?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Can you write it down?  Yeah.  I won't give it away, but I need to know.  Oh, man.  Let's see. 
[01:30:00]  Okay.  There's the picture right there.  Oh, my God.  I retweeted that picture today to try to get my numbers up a little bit on the...  That is an amazing ass.  Look how silky it looks.  It looks silky.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  And he meant it.  He meant it.  Oh, my God.  I laughed about that for 16 hours. 
[01:30:30]  That is funny.  I'm sorry to do that to the radio audience.  I think we can kind of say it, because he said it.  But I also don't know if he's going to use it in his act, because he literally just came  out.  It was...  Oh, man.  I'm like, you've got to say that.  That's a good one.  And eventually we'll find it.  So I apologize to the listeners.  Eventually we'll tell the people.  Or get him on the phone.  Maybe he'll just say it for us.  Also today, Chelsea Handler coming in.  She's got a new book.  I always get bummed I'm in the airport and I see her books, because she's always got  something...  Like, she's got, like, four or five books now, and they're always fucking bestsellers, and 
[01:31:00]  they're, like, hard copies in the airport.  She makes a lot of money.  Uganda.  Be kidding me is the name of the book.  What is it about?  I don't know if it's just, uh...  If she wants...  Oh, my God.  Chapter 7 is Mount A Negro.  She's going for it.  Like Montenegro?  Yeah, but she's...  Mount A Negro.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  I know.  It's a play in words, but she wrote it out.  Mount A Negro.  Gotcha.  Oh, my Lord.  What are some of the other chapters?  Is she really, uh...  Out of Africa?  Into the Bush? 
[01:31:30]  Camp Dumbo?  Let's see...  They're all little plays on words, I think.  Yeah.  I don't know what she's up to.  I don't know if she was, uh...  Is she, uh...  Does she go with the black dudes?  I don't know.  I mean...  She was connected with 50 Cent for a while.  Well, she did.  I had a picture of them.  Was that, like, a real thing?  Because I know they kind of do that thing...  They kind of do that in Hollywood.  Hook had told me they were fucking.  Oh, yeah, but...  Who Kid knows?  He's the inside, uh...  But Who Kid lies.  Okay, it's a good kind of game.  He does say a lot of...  He lies. 
[01:32:00]  All his pictures on, uh...  Is she taking a dump here?  On Instagram.  On the boat?  You see this?  Yeah, it's great.  All Who Kid's Instagram pictures...  Page 102 looks like Chelsea Handler's squatting to take a little leaky or something.  They look like they're 3D.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  What were you saying about the Who Kid?  All his pictures on Instagram look like they're 3D.  They're great.  Like, they're all blurry and...  They're, like...  He's got...  The colors all fucked up on them.  He's got a great Instagram as he travels the world.  It's kind of...  A lot of moisture, as they say. 
[01:32:30]  It's kind of cool to see where he is.  A lot of moisture.  A lot of moisture.  All right.  You think Scarlet...  Whoa.  You think Scarlet's your hands?  Oh, my God.  What is this?  That's Who Kid's Instagram video.  What's going on?  What are the strings?  What are they working on like a puppet?  It's booty boxing.  He's got a booty boxing video.  Play that again.  It's booty boxing.  Raining.  Two chicks with their asses bouncing together. 
[01:33:00]  Like they're twerking.  Butt to butt.  Right.  And what's the object?  And they're throwing money at them.  Make it rain.  Make it rain, motherfucker.  Make it rain.  Make it rain.  Them brothers is hilarious, yo.  Hilarious.  Let's see.  Hold on.  You think Scarlet will snap back?  Because she's right.  She's 29.  She's not a big by any means. 
[01:33:30]  But she's juicy.  She's got it all in the right places.  But those right places, if a girl is like that to begin with, might have some trouble.  Girls have no problem bouncing back.  I hear you.  I know it scares the crap out of you, but I'm telling you.  But there's plenty that don't.  Well, there's plenty of girls that don't.  They're lazy.  I know.  That's what I mean.  Look at, who was it recently?  Miranda Kerr had a baby.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see the latest pictures of her?  She was pretty much anorexic beforehand, though. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, King.  Why didn't you do that?  He was right there.  I know.  I just figured I'd let him talk.  Well, oof.  I couldn't do it because it would almost be like making fun of his Bell's Palsy.  Oh.  Because you've got to kind of make your face freeze when you're talking like, oh, my God, King.  Did you guys tell us Palsy?  He had it like three times.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  First time was back in, like, 95, I think, or something like that, right?  He had the greatest interaction with Florentine. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah?  Like, Florentine came in and just said hi to him.  And he was here to record his Boneyard show.  Fuck Florentine!  Oh, shit.  Another phony fuck.  He's starting wars.  Yeah.  I love Jim.  Of course.  And J.R. goes,  Oh, what do you talk about on your show?  And Florentine goes,  Mainly fucking chicks.  Mainly fucking chicks.  He's like, are you down with that? 
[01:35:00]  And J.R. is like, yeah, I've been heterosexual for a long time.  And Florentine goes,  Super quick, lightning fast.  He goes,  What were you before?  What were you before?  He's great.  They talk for a little while and you think, like, okay, we're done joking around.  We're just having a conversation now.  Right.  And J.R. asks him, like, if he smokes, what kind of cigarettes does he smoke?  No, I don't smoke.  Oh, how'd your voice get like that?  Mainly eating pussy.  Eating pussy.  Does, uh, Florentine doesn't drink anymore, does he? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, but he has a beer once in a while.  He never really had a problem with it.  His problem was mostly shots of cum.  He couldn't.  He was a two-fist.  Jim seems like a guy that would, or would have been, maybe even still would, I don't know,  but been a really fun guy to hang out with.  Like, just a funny, fun guy.  One of those guys you want to spend a Saturday night fucking hanging out, partying with.  Dude, I've gone to so many concerts.  And I don't even drink, but he's not an obnoxious drinker.  Right, right.  And I've been drinking a few beers, and I've stood in the park, and he'll piss anywhere. 
[01:36:00]  It's great.  He can literally make me laugh anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Florentine is the funniest guy ever.  He's a funny motherfucker, man.  What is all this?  Hey.  The worst Scarlett Johansson photoshopped.  Oh, they're all photoshopped.  Oh, okay.  Boy, do I hate a nude photoshopped, like, fake.  Oh, I thought that really was her.  Come on.  She'd be the one with the dick inside of her anus.  Like, she would do that.  Oh, I thought that was, no.  Oh, just stop it. 
[01:36:30]  In the neighborhood.  So, Jesse Ventura did a Reddit AMA.  Yes.  Ah, what was he talking about?  9-11?  He didn't get...  The lawsuit?  He didn't get a lot of...  No?  He didn't get a lot in, because...  A lot of people were knuckleheads.  Oh, boy, our listeners kind of took over for a while.  The Opie and Anthony sub-forum on Reddit is quite active.  Quite active.  So, they decided to get involved.  Uh-huh. 
[01:37:00]  Let's see.  Jesse Ventura.  You want to do this?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You got everyone get their handouts?  Oh, I'm ready.  Oh, I do.  Oh, it's not a...  Right.  Yeah, no.  It's a...  Whoa, this is like a worksheet.  So, the question was, uh, what do you think about Greg Hughes, the American who recently  joined the Taliban?  Wait a minute.  That's...  And then a guy quickly goes, I think Greg prefers to be called the Destroyer.  Ah.  And then Jesse had to answer this question. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, what did he say?  Well, I guess when you...  Well, you should read the Jesse.  Well, I guess when you live in what's supposed to be a free country, you have the ability  to make a stupid decision.  That's all part of freedom.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's actually the right answer.  It is kind of the right answer.  But Greg Hughes isn't actually in the Taliban.  I know.  I wouldn't think so.  I'm aware of the fact that Greg Hughes is not an American Taliban.  You're not an American Taliban?  Yes.  You'd hate that.  Look for drones over his head? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And then look at all the people.  Yeah.  One guy just writes, thanks for your service.  Thank you for your service.  Another guy, pause, pause, pause.  I got to disagree that even though we live in a free country, Greg should have been reprimanded  by Tim for joining the Taliban, okay?  A nice breakfast didn't help.  He just wrote, my teeth are dry.  Yeah.  Oh, come on now.  Wow, look at this one.  I didn't see that sick one.  He did address it, though, huh?  Well, let's see. 
[01:38:30]  Hmm.  Oh, and then this guy writes, like suing the widow of a murdered hero.  Uh-huh.  That's a pretty stupid and heartless decision, right?  Exactly.  He didn't acknowledge that was even said.  No, I wouldn't.  Let's see.  He's the crazy one, meaning Greg Hughes.  The two G's at the end stand for double guns.  That's nice.  Let's see.  I'm sorry.  Wow. 
[01:39:00]  He addressed our program, huh?  Okay.  So then the next one was, are you afraid to go back on the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  No.  I'm not afraid to go on it.  But I just don't desire to go on it.  They're very disrespectful.  And I don't have time to deal with people who disrespect me.  And I don't have to do the show.  So I won't do it. 
[01:39:30]  That's actually nicer than what Jason said.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He, uh...  How were we disrespectful to him before he turned into a complete asshole?  Yeah.  I mean, we were very respectful.  He was on a lot.  Taking his, uh...  He...  Opinions and, and, uh...  Debating them.  He got killed in the debate to the point where he was frustrated and left the show.  He was, uh...  We didn't disrespect him.  If you hear the audio, you can hear that he was being rude first. 
[01:40:00]  And it sounds like...  Because the video...  Because you were only taping off that GoPro or whatever it was at the time.  The, uh...  Right.  Flip cam.  So there's only pieces of the video that are missing.  So people who don't hear the whole video...  But I've gotten hate mail from his fans.  I think there's...  A lot of that interview is finally out there.  Oh, it's out there now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can get it.  And I'll write them back and I'll go, uh...  Go to that.  Go find...  Don't...  I'm...  You're fucking lazy.  Go find the entire interview and listen to it.  And then write me back.  Yeah.  And they're always...  It's always the same thing.  I had never heard the whole question. 
[01:40:30]  So anyway, there's a lot of our listeners just getting in here.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What should we do with this?  Just pages and pages and pages.  Yeah.  I'm just waiting.  Maybe Sal should have highlighted some of the better ones.  Oh, he only highlighted...  He highlighted the questions that he answered.  Yeah, the answer.  Like, what's your opinion of recent leaks given out by Lyle Chipperson?  Right.  Which he had to address.  And he goes, can you share more information?  Can you share more information? 
[01:41:00]  Heh, heh, heh.  Come on.  Nah, I guess the rest of it...  I'd actually like to know, aside from the O&A stuff...  Yeah.  ...what his whole deal was.  Was he sounding like a crazy conspiracy guy?  Was he sounding like an expatriate?  Because I know he doesn't really like America.  Right.  He likes going to Mexico, living there for a while. 
[01:41:30]  Mexico.  Which must be great on taxes.  Yeah.  Somebody asked him, what is your opinion on Scorch's PFG TV?  Well, that's a very good question.  Pretty fucking good.  Did he answer that?  He didn't get to answer that.  Scorch had a good bit the other day.  No.  Yeah.  What did he do?  Well, I think it was National Pop-Tart Day.  Come on.  He tweeted out, or I think it might have been on Facebook, you know, trying to get some  action for his next radio shop. 
[01:42:00]  And he said something like, in honor of Pop-Tart Day, National Pop-Tart Day, I'm asking you,  what's your favorite Pop-Tart?  Come on.  And he said, I'll be doing this tomorrow.  Find it?  As in...  Proof where it didn't happen.  Keep your answers clean.  Right.  Keep them clean.  No smut.  That's a bit that can last maybe 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  What's your favorite Pop-Tart?  How about cinnamon? 
[01:42:30]  That's a good one, right?  I'm a brown sugar cinnamon guy.  Brown sugar and cinnamon.  Without the icing.  I'm not a big fan of Pop-Tarts with the icing, because I think it's a little too much goodness.  A little too much goodness.  Now you're throwing a little too much controversy into that subject.  A little too much.  I don't...  A little too much.  You find better...  It only is funny if somebody wrote,  Shut up, Jossie, Ventura.  Jossie.  You find it there, Sammy?  Sammy.  Here it is.  Celebrating Pop-Tart. 
[01:43:00]  All right, go ahead.  Celebrating Pop-Tart's anniversary.  We'll be talking about this tomorrow on the show.  What's your fave Pop-Tart flavor?  Where's he working these days?  He's working on an internet radio station in California.  He can beat everyone.  What?  I thought it was regular radio.  I don't think it's real radio.  He moved all the way to California?  Yeah, he went to San Diego for a radio gig on the internet, right? 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  But that it's like...  I don't know what it is.  Can he get a chip from home?  I've tried to figure it out.  Huh?  But it ain't good for him.  Yeah, why did he have to move all the way there to do that?  Pick up and go.  You just Google what...  Where is he?  Out of San Diego?  Yeah, I think San Diego.  All right, so you Google San Diego, you get some good facts about San Diego, and you do it from your home.  Right.  Right?  Unless he doesn't have a computer.  He has to.  Just support Scorch.  In the end, we like the guy a lot. 
[01:44:00]  Support him, please.  Then he does stuff like this.  What?  Come on.  What do you do?  Rock all night.  I walk by this billboard every day.  It's not there.  It's never said rock all night with Scorch's PFG TV.  Wait, what billboard is it?  It's right on 50...  It is...  What?  So, wait a minute.  Wait, so Scorch...  He's making fake billboards.  He didn't Photoshop a Times Square billboard.  Yes.  No, he didn't.  He put a fake...  No, guys, he's getting some good promotion.  That's Broadway in 50th. 
[01:44:30]  Well, good for Scorch getting a billboard in Times Square.  We had one once.  Yeah.  Can you make that bigger so we can see if there's any...  I literally walk by the billboard every day.  Why didn't you talk to us about the Scorch billboard?  It wasn't there.  Of course it's there.  I can see the picture.  Oh, yeah, you can see.  That's a real billboard.  Yeah, make it bigger.  You can totally tell.  See?  Oh, that's so awful.  Rock all night with Scorch PFG.  That's kind of cool.  Where do you get it?  There's no...  God damn.  They're really putting a lot of money behind this.  But nobody would look at that and know what it is.  What?  Yeah.  It's not even straight. 
[01:45:00]  He didn't even fucking...  What does the...  What does he say about it on Facebook?  Hey, FB family, the phones will be open in less than one hour.  First time callers, that's great.  Regular caller, you're always welcome.  Lots to talk about tonight.  Rock all night with Scorch PFG.  PFG.  Also, he doesn't even...  He doesn't even like...  He wants people to believe that's a real billboard.  Doesn't acknowledge it.  Oh, wait.  It's crooked normally.  Okay.  Yeah, it's got a little slant to it. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  It's got a little slant to it, so the billboard is a little slanty.  Because he's a little, you know.  He has a little slant to what he does.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Did you guys see his question from two days ago?  No.  If you could get a pizza, in all capital letters, with a famous rock and roller, who would you  grab a slice with?  Why would you...  What is the pizza after?  It's a good question.  Who would I grab a slice with?  It's not a good question.  Who would I grab a slice with?  Probably Kaz Elliott.  Fun to watch it choke. 
[01:46:00]  The old Heimlich.  A few more Mamas and Papas tunes.  If you save your life.  What do you do with a question like that?  Nothing.  Exactly.  Ignore it.  B.  Good for him.  Come on.  I'm trying to even come up with a goof answer.  I can't come up with a goof answer to that question.  Pizza.  I'm trying to think of someone that might have had a stroke or something, but...  Pizza.  B.  Oh, boy. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  So, the Jesse Ventura, thanks to everybody that participated in that.  We didn't ask anyone to participate.  They took it upon themselves and kind of took over for a while.  Yeah.  And Jesse should come back on our show.  Why not?  It's fine if he does.  It's fine if he doesn't.  I mean...  Yeah.  We're not going to lose sleep over it, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think it's affected the show, not having him on.  The fact that he's suing Chris Kyle's widow, if he's still involved in that, it's like,  what an asshole. 
[01:47:00]  He's a fucking kook.  I don't want her making proceeds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Wait.  Buff Bagwell is now a gigolo?  Yes.  What?  The Buff Bagwell?  Buff the stuff.  Do you guys remember Buff Bagwell?  Buff the stuff.  From the WWF at the time.  Now the WWE, of course.  Wait a minute.  Which guy was that?  You remember Buff Bagwell?  He was big for a while, right? 
[01:47:30]  Really?  He was a big WCW guy.  What was he?  I don't remember him.  He was in the NWO.  Oh, see, that was after I punched out.  NWO was after I left.  No, he didn't.  You know Buff Bagwell.  Nah, I...  Show Buff Bagwell in his prime.  Honestly, I didn't pay attention to the NWO stuff.  But you know...  I would remember the name.  I remember all the names, but that one doesn't...  What was his thing?  Ring a bell.  He used to come out and... 
[01:48:00]  Here he is on the Jenny Jones show.  Wow.  Oh, I remember Jenny Jones?  Oh, shit.  No.  WCW is in the house.  No, because I saw Goldberg on that clip.  You want a Goldberg fan?  I wasn't watching wrestling when Goldberg was part of WWE.  Now forget, this clip is horrible.  Holy shit, is that terrible?  But Buff Bagwell is now a gigolo and is on a reality show where he's learning how. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, and he's a legit...  Like, if you go to the Gigolo company website...  Right.  He's on there.  I mean...  What do you mean a gigolo?  He probably fucks me...  Ah, man, cow!  Turd.  Turd.  Wait, wait, go back.  I gotta hear it.  I gotta hear it.  Oh, no.  How bad is this gonna be?  Another dishonest guy in this business.  Phony fuck.  Another phony fuck.  This clip is gonna make you feel better about the XFL pregame.  Go ahead.  I gotta hear it, man, cow. 
[01:49:00]  Man, cow.  You went back too far.  Yeah, a little bit.  Bad audio and going back too far.  That's brutal.  They're just showing some...  That's Buff Bagwell.  Yeah, I don't remember him at all.  No.  He's a jiggle.  Not at all.  Oh, I can't do this, man.  How would you introduce...  Ready to do it.  Okay.  Ready to do it.  Wow.  Here we go.  Thanks, Jenny.  Weighing in at nearly 250 pounds. 
[01:49:30]  He's a four-time tag team champion and the master of his signature moves.  Why is he wearing sunglasses?  The Buff Block Buster.  Give it up, Chicago, for Buff Bagwell.  Yeah.  Why is he there?  Why is he wearing his dumb sunglasses?  I don't know.  What is he up to these days?  What's the man, cow, up to?  I don't know.  Maybe he's a gigolo.  Everything he's tried has failed.  Like, everything they've put him on, he's just failed miserably. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, you're in a rare mood today.  I love it.  I can't stand it.  I'm going to ask you a lot of questions today.  I just had it.  Really?  I had it with some of these people.  The Dallas thing just put me over the top today.  Had it with him.  Well, you used to be a man, cow fan.  Well, you know, I was probably one of the top ten callers.  Oh, that's a great question.  Oh, did I get fucked on that one?  Greatest fucking call ever.  We were supposed to kill him that day, and you made a show better. 
[01:50:30]  Who does that?  I fell into listener mode and wanted to make a good call.  Oh, that's a good question.  Oh, good question.  No, he lowered his voice.  Yeah, anyway.  Oh, that's a good question.  You got that?  Oh, that's a good question.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I don't even remember why we were calling him that day.  Why?  We wanted to prank him.  Obviously.  For what reason?  I think it was just because we were talking about him, and then we realized we could because  we realized he was on live.  Right.  But the setup was like 45 minutes trying to get the number, and getting through the phone 
[01:51:00]  screener, and just sitting there waiting on hold the whole time.  I finally got through, live on the air.  The screener told me to say, hey, Mancow, love you, love the show.  No, they didn't.  Yes, they did.  No, they didn't.  They tell everyone to do that, so I had to say it.  And then I asked the fake question first to lull them into a false sense of security.  Right.  And then that way you could give the zinger and destroy him. 
[01:51:30]  But what I didn't know is, Mancow's one of those guys that once you give the question,  he doesn't keep you on the line as he answers.  He hangs up.  And it took away my opportunity, so all I did was, I was a good caller to his program.  What are you hearing is, Anthony, justifying the fact that he failed miserably that day.  I failed.  We're all counting on you.  I should have said something.  This is how it went down.  Tony in New York, hello. 
[01:52:00]  Mancow, love you, love the show, man.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this Britain situation with the sailors that were  taken hostage, as I see it.  There's a problem.  I don't see the president speaking out on this.  And now I'm hearing that the United States has been told not to comment by Britain because  of the worldview of our country.  The British are telling us to please stay out of this so as not to make trouble.  I see this as maybe Britain turning on us a little bit as an ally in this situation. 
[01:52:30]  What do you think about this?  Well, I think that's a brilliant thing.  I think that's a brilliant question.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mancow.  It's a great thing to bring up.  I think we need to keep our nose out of it right now.  I think we got all...  We're like that...  Well, Sam Childers knew this picture.  Why didn't I say something?  She's a nice girl.  Well, she's always sticking her nose in people with it.  And I think we need to keep our nose out of everybody's business right now.  Why didn't I say something?  I got all caught up in my head.  I'm going to guess because you're an asshole. 
[01:53:00]  I'm okay with that for now.  I got all caught up.  It was an eight-minute question you asked him.  I was really now asking a question.  I was waiting to come back.  That's why I said, do you?  Like, shit like that.  Wouldn't it be funny if Anthony just became a caller to the Mancow show?  It was.  That's pretty much what just happened, Jimmy.  God. 
[01:53:30]  I went on and on.  But you had like 15 seconds there where you're like, uh-huh.  Oh, I got all caught up.  Why didn't I say something?  We all hear where the Ramon was supposed to be.  Oh, man.  What an asshole.  Well, what is he doing now?  Oh, he's got a militia.  Join the Mancow militia.  No, does he?  Listen how you want.  Listen live.  Scream on demand.  Podcasts on the go.  Mancow militia.  Join now.  I got to do voiceovers. 
[01:54:00]  Anyone listening out there, I could do a few different little voices for everybody.  Come on.  Let's do this.  Ow.  Hunt.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, why wouldn't it?  Oh.  I can't throw out a fucking napkin without electrocuting myself.  Anyway, what are we doing?  Are we doing Buff Bagwell?  Oh, right.  It's a quick clip.  He's now a gigolo.  He used to be a big superstar.  I don't remember him at all.  He used to be a big WWF superstar.  He used to, uh, Big Papa Pump, right? 
[01:54:30]  Was one of the guys?  Yeah, him and Big Papa Pump were like team.  Uh, Big Papa Pump.  He was hilarious for a while.  Yeah.  He was so obnoxious.  And he has all the best clips of messing up.  Like, Big Papa Pump just gets his words all confused and flustered all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember some of the stuff he used to say.  Uh, Big Papa Pump is your hookup.  Holler if you hear me.  That's right.  There's one.  It doesn't ring a bell.  He was trying to get a t-shirt going.  Yeah, and he would send a message to all his freaks out there because he was trying 
[01:55:00]  to get chicks.  And he called them his freaks.  Trying to get chicks?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Obviously, wrestling is a huge sport and there's a ton of fans.  So I thought it would...  Whoa!  A little mystery?  That's not Buff talking.  That's the leader of the gigolos talking.  Oh, okay.  It'd be great to have Buff join the agency.  So take him under your wing, show him some tricks of the trade.  And also, I got an appointment that you're all four going to go on.  So it's one of those kind of things. 
[01:55:30]  What is this reality show?  It sounds awful.  It's on Showtime.  And what is it?  It's just like all the gigolos getting together and doing things that gigolos do together.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Trial by fire.  Yeah, yeah.  Something you're going to have to get used to.  Got to get warmed up on.  Got to warm up.  Let's do it.  I love it.  If things work out great, then we'll open up the Atlanta division.  Nice.  It's a good market.  I've had one job my entire life, and that was pro wrestling.  So when you go from A to B with that kind of background, it's really hard. 
[01:56:00]  But I love women to death, and I always have.  And this is the first time I've seen a chance to segue from wrestling, and I'm all over it.  I want to do it.  Thanks for the chance, guys.  Yeah.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.  We're going to find out if Buff has got the stuff.  Oh, boy.  That's sad, though.  That's pretty sad.  I was a pro wrestler, and I finally figured out something I could make a second career in.  Yeah, yeah.  Gigolodom.  No, I think it's sad in reverse. 
[01:56:30]  This is the better job.  I don't know.  Do I want to roll around with guys on a mat and get kicked, or do I want to fuck girls for a living?  For money.  Yeah.  Is that really going on, though?  It does.  Are girls really hiring guys?  I imagine girls don't do it as much as guys.  I would say it's a Joe Buck situation with fucking...  But I imagine if you go into the gigolo business, you're going to have to deal with some unpleasantries as well.  Hello.  It's kind of like being a gynecologist. 
[01:57:00]  You're not going to get all fresh ones.  You're not getting any attractive girls at that.  You're probably getting 99% gay guys and old men.  That's what I'm saying, too.  I think you have to dip into those categories if you're a gigolo.  And maybe very desperate girls.  I think you've got to go at least 10%, 15% guys, 85% women is, I think, what you hope for. 
[01:57:30]  But I can't imagine you're a gigolo and you're not avoiding the homosexuals.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of homosexuals.  I think, yeah, a lot of old guys, probably old men, and very rarely some very overweight, unattractive women.  That's what you get.  It's not some fucking...  It's not a movie.  That's real life right there.  Right.  You're not finding porn stars.  No.  They're like, you know what?  I'd really like a gigolo this evening. 
[01:58:00]  A gigolo.  A gigolo.  No girl...  If a girl wants a guy, she goes to a fucking bar.  Yeah.  Just anywhere.  Go online.  Have you ever known a girl...  A girl's got it easy, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  They could just do anything and grab a guy.  It doesn't matter how fucking...  You know how hard we have to work?  Ugh.  They just go...  It's crazy.  They walk in a bar, and then they just decide.  That's it.  They just decide.  Belly up to the bar, look around.  Some guy will come over, try to buy you a drink.  There you go.  If you're just looking for dick, that's your dick. 
[01:58:30]  Right there.  Right.  Guy will come right over.  Right.  The guy, meanwhile, he's got to, you know, have the fucking look, have the fucking rap,  all that shit.  So, uh, man-cow's repossessing, uh, cars with his brother?  That's true, huh?  Oh, is that one of those dumb reality shows?  I think that's a reality show he's doing.  It's another dumb, fake...  Oh, I hate those goddamn fake towing repossession shows.  Is that what he's doing now?  You think they're fake? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  They're the worst.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  That would be a cool show if it was real.  Start the car!  Start the car!  Let's get away!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Oh, come on.  Oh, we have the turd clip?  We haven't played in a while.  Turd!  Come on, let's do it today.  I want to hear the fucking car.  What I love about this...  The turd clip.  Man-cow had a guy named Turd who, uh...  Turd!  Stunt boy turd!  Turd!  Hold on.  Do you have the whole clip, though?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Okay.  I love it. 
[01:59:30]  And in all fairness, uh, Turd did some pretty good stunt boy-ish things for Man-cow.  Yeah.  But this one is awful.  And the reason why is because, uh, the bit was that Turd was gonna crash a car into a  wall.  Right.  Into a brick wall.  And let the airbag, uh, deploy.  Sure.  Um, but the production of this is horrendous.  It's so bad.  It's just a sound effect from the production studio.  It's an engine sound, uh, an engine of a car and Turd talking over it. 
[02:00:00]  Nothing changes.  There's no changes, there's no change in the engine noise.  I think it was real.  The bad crash sound, the, it's, everything's wrong.  And then Man-cow it is, Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  It's so fucking bad.  Oh, boy.  We've done some bad radio.  Hey, come on.  Right there.  I cut him off in the past.  We understand.  We understand.  We've done some bad radio ourselves. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, boy.  That's why, with the Jocktober thing, we, uh, we beat the crap out of us by the end of it.  We address it.  We understand.  Yeah.  But it doesn't mean we can't point out some of the bad ones.  This was really bad.  All right.  If anyone bought this.  All right.  Go ahead, Travis.  Turd!  Yes, sir.  Are you ready, bud?  15.  15 miles an hour.  He's going to give us the countdown.  20.  Racing into the side of a factory.  25.  It's generic.  No, it is.  30 miles an hour. 
[02:01:00]  Anything happens to him, Cal?  I'll tell you.  35.  Oh.  35 miles an hour, right now.  Oh, my God.  Maximum speed of 65.  Oh, my God.  A long course has been set up.  Oh, my God.  Come on, Turd.  25.  That's the sound effect.  And the phone hanging up too quickly.  Straight to dial phone.  The sound effect of the crash.  That's the sound effect that every radio guy in America has used. 
[02:01:30]  I think it's the end of this one.  Pretty close.  Yeah.  And why did the sound of the car crash happen in the studio and the voice over the phone?  It was weird, yeah.  Oh, God.  I also want to say, it didn't sound like the car was going any faster.  It just sounded like it was a consistent noise.  That's what it is.  The consistent engine sound.  And then the bad acting by the whole turd.  Anything happen, man, Cal? 
[02:02:00]  Anything happens.  It's just a cow.  Oh, Cal.  Anything happens, Cal?  You don't think she was good?  Oh, was she terrible?  Wow, that was so bad.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  I want to get turd on this show badly.  Oh, I'd love to.  I'd love to hear from him.  We'll be nice.  I swear.  Yeah, that'd be a good one.  Someone find turd for us.  This guy has seen the gigolo show.  Oh, really?  I couldn't think of a name when you said someone find turd for us. 
[02:02:30]  I was just thinking of look on the head of, and I couldn't think of a name.  Oh.  Ron in Kansas.  What's up, Ron?  Good morning.  I saw some reality show a while back about gigolos.  And these guys are going with these women that are late 40s, early 50s, even 60s that are widows  or executive types that are in town for a weekend business, something or other.  And that's mainly what these guys are doing.  So, like we said, it's old broads. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, mainly stuff like that.  So, I don't know.  Viagra?  I don't know.  But there wasn't any of the day stuff.  Joe DeRosa should be a gigolo, man.  You think so?  56-year-old women?  He'd be in heaven.  You're right.  Thanks, guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, Ron.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, sir.  So, that's what Buff Bagwell's doing.  Buff Daddy.  Buff Daddy, huh? 
[02:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  Buff this stuff.  Chelsea Handler will be here in the next hour.  Nine o'clock hour, right?  Around nine or so.  I'm going to ask her about Black Gentlemen.  That's the question you're going to ask her?  That's my goal.  I've heard rumor.  50 Cent?  Is that...  That's the rumor.  Or Fiddy?  We've had Fiddy on.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Who Kid backed that up?  Yeah, Who Kid has stated.  You can't always believe Who Kid.  Well, this is true. 
[02:04:00]  But he doesn't always bullshit.  He said he was bringing in Mike Tyson, and he did.  He did.  He absolutely did.  He walked down all of them, so...  I like that Who Kid.  He's fun.  I do, too.  Yeah, he's great.  Absolutely.  Okay.  We'll take a break here.  Stay there.  Hopi and Anthony will be right back.  On Sirius XM.

[02:14:00]  I'm kind of on his side on this one with these horse cars.  I don't want them anymore.  They fuck up traffic.  There's no need for it.  Go to Lancaster, Pennsylvania if you want to ride a fucking horsey.  Get them out of New York. 
[02:14:30]  He's a horse shit in New York.  What's the stuff in horse shit on Park Avenue South?  It really stinks over there.  Yes.  It really smells bad.  Get the fucking part of New York.  I got no problem with getting rid of that shit.  Get rid of them.  Not even for the humanitarian reason.  Just the fact that they stink.  They do hold up traffic.  And then I do feel bad for the little horseys.  And they get scared every once in a while.  They get scared.  Hit by a cab.  They panic.  They bite an electrical line.  Those dumb fucking horses.  Well, there was a good article yesterday.  Because Liam Neeson wants de Blasio to at least see the stables. 
[02:15:00]  And see that these horses are well taken care of.  And here's why I wanted to bring it up on the show.  That's what you guys think and that's fine?  Yeah.  De Blasio has decided, no, I'm not going to.  He doesn't even want to have an open mind about it.  Doesn't even want to meet with him?  He doesn't even want to meet to see how well the horses are being taken care of.  Because he just assumes that the horses are being treated like shit.  He should meet with him and just dip some sushi in his hair.  That would be wonderful to see because it's got soy sauce hair. 
[02:15:30]  I like de Blasio not just fucking going up.  Because he knows the tables are going to be all dolled up.  And they probably are okay looking.  Dolled up, yeah.  But they're just standing there on a curb waiting.  He's a pompous ass, though.  He really is.  And then he's banging heads with Cuomo there over the school thing.  Over the school thing.  He wants to tax everybody to pay for some pre-K.  Everybody.  That would be nice.  No, he just wants to tax the quote-unquote wealthy, which in New York City, it's a lot 
[02:16:00]  higher than if you were just somewhere else in the country.  But he considers it wealthy at probably, what, $250,000?  $250,000?  I need people to understand this elsewhere.  $250,000 a year in New York City is nothing.  You don't understand.  When you come to New York City...  It's nothing.  Wait, I can say this.  Most apartments, one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan, now Brooklyn, and in a lot of the surrounding 
[02:16:30]  areas, go for just under a million dollars.  Yeah.  For one bedroom.  It's a million dollars.  One bedroom.  Yeah.  That's what we're talking about here.  So when you're trying to tell people that make $250,000 a year, try to tell them that  they're rich and they can handle another tax.  That's ridiculous.  Like, we can handle that.  Yes.  It's annoying to us.  But our lifestyles will not change.  One iota.  But to people making $250,000, that's a big fucking deal.  So he's banging heads with Cuomo, and Cuomo's like, we're paying for this shit. 
[02:17:00]  There's another way to pay for this.  Yeah.  He said the state has enough money to do this already.  It's the pre-K program?  Yeah.  Right.  Then why is Blasio fighting him on it?  The government is saying...  It's amazing.  Because he's a pompous ass.  What a douche.  Because it has nothing to do with the schools.  It has nothing to do with actually doing it and getting the money.  It has to do with the fact that he loves the idea of taking money away from what he perceives  as wealthy people and giving it to people that aren't wealthy. 
[02:17:30]  That's what socialists do.  And you know, supposedly the politicians, they work for us.  Remember that?  Yes.  That crap that they all say?  Representing us.  On the front page of the paper today here in New York, you had 11,000 parents show up  for a rally to do it Cuomo's way.  Right.  And you had 1,500 people showing up to do it de Blasio's way, and de Blasio is still  ignoring the voice of the people.  Exactly.  The people don't want this. 
[02:18:00]  No.  I think those are two separate issues.  Are they?  I think that's charter school stuff.  Oh, charter school?  Yeah.  What does that know?  That de Blasio wants to get rid of charter school.  He doesn't like charter schools.  Right, right.  Okay.  Cuomo, again, is fighting for that.  So there's a couple issues that they're banging heads over.  Right.  Yeah.  De Blasio said that he doesn't want the state to pay for universal pre-K because he made  a campaign promise.  Right.  And he needs to stick to it.  It's not...  And Cuomo said, good for you and your campaign promise, but there's a better way to do this. 
[02:18:30]  And de Blasio is ignoring the fact that there might be a better way to do this.  He just wants to take money away from what he perceives as wealthy and give it away to  the poor.  He sees the Robin Hood.  He feels like he would be...  Robin Hood.  Who?  Going against what the voters voted.  Right, right, right.  But if there's a better way, there's a better way.  Period.  Uh-huh.  And then now what is the charter school issue?  De Blasio wants to close charter schools.  Right.  And a lot of people don't want that to happen. 
[02:19:00]  Of course.  And that's the rally yesterday with the 11,000 parents for the charter schools.  What is the charter school?  Cuomo supports keeping them open.  Right.  And Cuomo wants it open.  And then you've got some union guys, 1,500 union guys fighting...  Wait, is that a different...  Wait, what is the charter school?  Now I'm confused with the 1,500, Travis.  Is that associated with the charter schools?  All right, I'm going to put you on hold of it.  I think de Blasio had a rally and like 1,000 people showed up or something. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, 1,500 looks like.  And Cuomo had one and like 7,000.  11,000, it says on the front page.  I'm looking at the daily news.  What are you looking at?  Oh, hell.  Okay, so...  What is the charter school?  Well, I don't know what that means.  Now, we've confused the issue a little bit, but the fact is that they're banging heads  and Cuomo really feels like there's a better way to pay for all this stuff.  And what is the charter school?  I don't know.  I'm best three times.  I feel like I'm fucking...  I feel like I'm dreaming.  I'm not even here.  I'm reading as fast as I can.  I'm not 100% sure.  I don't know the exact definition of it.  I don't know.  Fucking rueful idiots. 
[02:20:00]  We're railing about it.  I don't want these charter schools.  What is that?  I don't know.  I've never heard of it.  I have no clue.  What?  Just another, you know...  I don't know what that issue is.  ...way to get your kids some education.  Okay.  I don't know what that issue is.  Instead of going to the public school in the area that might be shitty.  Oh.  I do believe that's what it is.  So then these charter schools pop up because people say, no, we could do this better.  Yeah, yeah.  And get some funding where we might have, you know, real school supplies.  A charter school is a school which receives public funding but operates independently. 
[02:20:30]  There you go.  So, thus then, possibly a better school experience for the children.  Yeah.  And de Blasio wants to shut that shit down because maybe, maybe too many kids that might  have just a little cash in their pockets.  Ah, that's it.  You know.  Yeah.  It's a disadvantage for others.  Of course, it's a disadvantage.  But a lot of these schools that are independently funded, they have all sorts of scholarship programs. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  So, my son's in one of these type of places.  Ooh.  And there's a lot of kids in his class that, you know, they're getting the free ride.  Mm-hmm.  They get the free ride.  Yeah.  But, uh...  We had a huge auction, I don't know, about a month ago now.  And it was all about raising money so less fortunate kids could go to this particular school.  De Blasio does not like anybody being above anybody else.  Like, if you have enough money to send your kid to a private school, he doesn't like that. 
[02:21:30]  He likes the idea of everybody being on equal footing.  Mm-hmm.  Like, you know, the communists.  That's pretty much what he's gunning for.  De Blasio is going to be a horrendous mayor.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's just not going to work out.  Yeah.  It's just not.  A lot of people are saying that once he really gets entrenched and starts pulling his shenanigans...  Right.  ...because he's relatively new in office, then it's going to be, you know, you're going to see some pretty bad changes. 
[02:22:00]  We'll see.  Let's see what he gets away with.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  People are shocked that $250,000 isn't wealthy in this area.  Really?  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  It's...  No one understands that.  I said, this guy...  Okay.  I knew this would happen.  Go ahead, Pete.  Hey, morning, guys.  Love your show.  I got a...  Of course you do.  ...$250,000 in perspective for me.  I'm from the Midwest.  What's the median income?  All right.  Well, I don't know officially.  But let's just put it this way. 
[02:22:30]  A one-bedroom apartment in New York City, in a lot of cases, goes for over a million.  But it's safe to say about $800,000 easily you're going to spend.  Yeah.  Okay?  So what does that buy you in South Dakota, where you're from?  It's going to buy a lot of households.  That's what I'm saying.  It buys you a lot in Jersey or Long Island compared to New York spaces.  Not as much, but it buys you more than it would, like, in Manhattan.  You can't even...  You can't even...  Yeah.  So that's what we're talking about.  So people...  I mean, I make about $70,000 driving a truck. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, I just...  I really love listening to you guys, but I just...  I don't know.  You can come on over and drive a truck, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Yeah.  So I know...  I'm going to punch out, fellas, and get back to listening to you.  All right.  Bye.  But I know, you know, when you say that $250,000 a year is not a lot of money in New York City,  because we're a national show, people are like, what?  I know.  People can't imagine it.  What are they telling you?  They cannot imagine...  You're not saving money.  No.  When you...  And that's people that... 
[02:23:30]  You can't even have kids.  No.  No.  Because now you're squeezed into a one-bedroom apartment with, let's say, your wife, and  then maybe your first kid.  It's brutal.  Yeah.  When you come to New York City to visit, a hotel is going to cost you a fortune.  Five, six hundred bucks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A night.  In the Times Square area, especially.  Not just for the entire vacation.  Right.  It was occupation tax.  Yeah.  Like, they just fucking rape you.  Oh, the taxes are just ridiculous.  Crazy.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  And then if you're lucky to live in a building, like myself, then you got just ridiculous charges 
[02:24:00]  that mean nothing.  Yeah.  Every month, it's $2,500 to my building that I don't get back.  I can't write off of nothing.  Just so they could bring a package up to me.  Yeah.  Why can't you write it off?  You can't write that off.  Maintenance charges?  Why not?  I don't think you can.  No.  Better call Javi.  Oh.  Javi.  Javi.  Gotta ask Javi.  I don't think so.  And then, you know, if you're lucky to have a car, then that costs you close to 500 bucks 
[02:24:30]  a month.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just have it in your building.  So right there, you're $3,000 a month in the hole.  And you don't get any of that back.  None of it.  And I'm not fucking crying.  I'm just giving you facts.  Mm-hmm.  Because the dumb ones out there love to twist everything.  I'm just giving facts.  I'm not crying.  I can afford it.  But it just sucks to throw money out like that.  Yeah.  Because I don't care.  I'll get my own mail, my own packages.  I can open up the front door myself.  Exactly.  I don't need anyone opening the door for me every day. 
[02:25:00]  Although those people...  You can do that yourself, right?  The people that work in my building, they're really nice.  Yeah.  And I like them better than the actual residents.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We got people in my building.  They will not leave or go into the building until someone opens the door for them.  And they will stand there.  So they stand there.  They will stand there and wait.  That's ridiculous.  And sometimes if I'm ahead of the doorman, they come scurrying.  And I wave them off.  I'm like, no.  Relax. 
[02:25:30]  I can open my own door.  I got it.  I got this.  I'm on it.  So.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  And then you got de Blasio fighting Liam Neeson over the horse and carriage thing.  Let's at least hear what Liam Neeson has to say about this.  We're about to be taken.  Taken on a plane.  Taken.  Yeah, now it's taken on a plane.  Taken on a plane, right?  Right.  Anyone see that movie?  Was it good?  Yeah.  The first one stunk, so I would never watch parts two or three. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I don't think it's officially taken three.  No, but it might as well be.  It's pretty similar.  Might as well be.  I'm still a fan of the first Taken, I got to say.  That's terrible.  It had some issues.  It had a few issues, yeah.  Dumb clunky run.  We had someone from Taken in here, didn't we?  We had Maggie.  What's her face?  Maggie Grace.  She was cute.  She was cool.  She's great.  She's beautiful in person.  Yeah.  Right.  But her run, grr, grr, grr.  That's what I heard when she ran.  The second one is so bad.  Of course it is.  Like, she does things that it's, what are you doing? 
[02:26:30]  She's fucking throwing grenades off her roofs.  She's shooting guns.  She's driving, like outmaneuvering fucking criminal professional drivers.  Lenny, Missouri, you could get a three-bedroom house with an attached garage for $100,000 in Missouri.  See?  See, that's what we're talking about.  Well...  And this guy's saying we got the whole de Blasio-Cuomo thing wrong.  Rick in Virginia, go ahead.  Yeah.  I just, I thought the argument that de Blasio was making was a little bit different in terms 
[02:27:00]  of the funding.  I thought he was saying that if he doesn't get the tax imposed, then he's subject to the  state, or the citizens are subject to the state budgetary constraints from year to year,  and that the money could just go away if Cuomo's approach is taken.  So, I mean, I think that's a little bit different argument.  Either way, I think, you know, education is one of those areas that we've thrown money and  thrown money and thrown money at it, and it's not helping.  But I do think the argument is a little different from de Blasio on this one. 
[02:27:30]  Hmm?  What happened?  I don't know.  I lost him, too.  Yeah.  Did we get it wrong or right?  We simply don't know enough to either debate you or...  We got it wrong or...  No, no.  I mean, de Blasio has said that, that he's wary of accepting Cuomo's offer because state  funding could be cut.  Right.  You know, whenever.  All right.  Let me take one more here.  Brian in Florida.  Brian.  All right.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  How you doing this morning?  Well, it's Blue Monster Weekend.  Blue Monster Weekend. 
[02:28:00]  What the hell's that?  PGA.  I was just talking about the charter school.  They redesigned the whole course down there at Doral.  Oh.  Watch out for the Blue Monster.  It's Trump's tournament now.  Yeah.  I think it's...  Is this the first year?  Does anyone know?  It's Donald Trump's gig?  All right.  Brian, what do you got?  I was just talking about charter schools.  My kids' school is converting from a public school to a charter school.  And basically, it's all about taking the money away from the local control and turning it 
[02:28:30]  over to the parents.  We basically found out with all the fundraising that we were doing, we could end up saving  about 20% by running the school basically as a private business compared to running it  at the public school.  All right.  All right.  So it's all about putting the money in the hands of the parents and taking it away from  the school board.  There you go.  And you know the money will be spent better. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I think.  And the teachers are still in their union down here.  They basically have a contract with the school.  We basically write the check to whoever it is that we're paying money to compared to  the Manatee County School Board.  So it's working out great.  The teachers are all for it, too.  I think your school taxes are used properly, don't you think?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, boys.  Have a great day.  Yes.  Thank you.  That topic is dead. 
[02:29:30]  I think it's horse shit.  That topic is dead.  Here's Liam Neeson.  But he's upset you somehow.  He wants to close this horse and carriage industry in New York.  And there was a poll last week.  Right.  Over 60 percent of New Yorkers want to keep the horse carriage industry in Central Park.  Maybe if they put it in the park.  I feel bad for them.  You know, we actually live right next door to them.  And I always feel bad for them on the streets.  It seems like they and a lot of the van traffic don't get along. 
[02:30:00]  The horses.  But listen, the horse carriage industry, they made the roads in New York.  I just want that to rest there.  They made the roads?  50 years ago.  What, are the roads made out of horse shit?  What do you mean they made the roads?  Construction made the roads.  What if they moved it into the park so the horses wouldn't have to walk the streets?  That's a compromise.  But, you know, these organizations, they want to put out this, all this false information  about how these horses are treated.  And these guys treat these horses like they're children. 
[02:30:30]  Have you been in this?  Really?  Seriously.  If Difus, if the Division of Youth and Family Services ever found out that they're keeping  their children in 60 square foot stalls and feeding them twice a day buckets of grain?  That's a lot.  That is not good parenting as far as I'm concerned.  You know, I just don't like the Blasio.  I think, yeah, the horse thing is pretty cool.  I don't care either way, but that does seem like a compromise if you want to keep them in the park.  Well, you can't get customers if it's in the park. 
[02:31:00]  Not as much.  Yeah, that's why.  Why would you want to drive around?  That's why they have them on such a park south.  You get more customers that way.  Why would you want to drive around in traffic, Bill?  And then you do see those weird ones down like 8th or 9th Avenue.  You're like, why is there a horse and carriage down here?  If they go into the park, whatever.  Yeah, they're fucking trotting down the road.  8th or 9th Avenue.  You're right next to their stalls.  Like, no, there's people in them.  Yeah.  They're giving rides.  I think their stalls are actually in Central Park somewhere. 
[02:31:30]  They should be banned.  No, they're on 10th, between 10th and 11th.  They're on the west side.  Are they?  Oh, yeah.  They should be banned.  And those fucking guys riding bikes.  You don't like the petty cab?  Hate them.  Hate them because they tie up traffic.  They suck.  They really do.  They tie up the right and left turn lanes.  Yeah, the guys are the fucking worst.  It's like, oh, they stay on the side of the road.  But, yeah, well, that's what the turn lanes are.  Right.  It's a big pain in the ass.  Well, the K-Corn incident continues. 
[02:32:00]  Uh-oh, what happened?  Uh, well.  K-Corn.  Shut your K-Corn.  Fez is very upset because he thinks gays aren't allowed in the fishbowl, I think.  Yeah.  Right?  But it's just him.  It's just him.  It's not allowed in the fishbowl.  But somehow he made it into a gay issue.  Gays.  We actually had out-cue events in the fishbowl.  Ron asked about his gay and Fez said yes.  Fez eventually found out.  All right, okay.  You know, people think that Fez might bother guests a little too much, so now they come  to get involved and basically tell them to stay away a little bit, and that got Fez 
[02:32:30]  going.  Gotcha.  And then he came up with the great term, K-Corn.  Well, he told.  K-Corn.  And then everyone started laughing, thinking it was really a fun and funny thing to go with.  But, of course, Fez wasn't being heard, so he was mad that everyone was laughing over  the term K-Corn, which was trending around America, which is a huge deal for any radio  show.  Number one nationwide.  Right.  That's awesome for those guys.  So then we played the clips here yesterday. 
[02:33:00]  And now Fez is talking about us playing the clips yesterday, right?  Oh, no.  Is that the setup?  Pretty much, yeah.  If you want to add to it.  Sam Roberts got blamed?  Believe it or not.  Oh.  How about that?  Believe it or not.  I'm walking on air.  Where could he be?  So, uh.  Believe it or not, I'm not home.  Boop.  So we got our first clip. 
[02:33:30]  Fez talking about us playing the clips.  Right.  Let's hear it.  I'm sorry.  I forgot that I had them.  Oh, E-Rock.  He got distracted.  I'm so used to you guys being the ones that have the clips.  Oh, I would love to have them in front of me.  It is an ear.  So I can stomp them when I want.  What are you looking up on the web?  How do you get your dog to stop breathing like Luca Brazzi with a fucking wire around his neck?  I was just doing some fan fiction.  A fan fiction and Bikini Girls.  All right.  Eric in Atlanta, you're on the run of the show. 
[02:34:00]  Here we go.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How you doing?  Good.  Doing good.  Hey, a little late to the show here.  What's this cake horn thing?  Yeah, act like you don't fucking know.  Oh, shit.  I'll tell you what.  Here's what you fucking do.  Go ask Sam Roberts what cake horn is.  Wow, right off the bat.  All right.  Pause.  Right off the bat.  Why doesn't he understand if he does the blueberry stand-alone fruit or the cake horn thing?  Cake horn.  It's just really good radio. 
[02:34:30]  And it gets people talking.  And of course, Ron Bennington should exploit it.  And then, of course, we should exploit it.  Of course.  The cuts are good.  Cross-promoting.  It gets people talking.  How many times did we say yesterday?  Why is he mad by this?  How many times did we say yesterday, yeah, Ron and Fez are on Raw Dog at noon, Sirius XM99.  Us playing those ridiculous cake horn clips definitely brought listeners to the Ron and Fez show yesterday.  Foghorn cake horn.  Love it.  Why is he still mad?  No clue.  Just go with it.  Because he's Fez.  All right.  Just call his clip show tomorrow and ask what cake horn's all about. 
[02:35:00]  Today, he's, of course, like the little pat rack that he is, he's taking, he founds a piece of tape, people busting my balls about saying cake horn, goes running with it to O&A.  Pick him a badge.  So he can just start stirring up shit one more time around here.  Sam Roberts is, for people that don't know him, because Sam's on the...  Because he's nobody?  Because he's on the O&A channel and not everybody here gets to hear the fabulous Opie and Anthony show without being part of that platform. 
[02:35:30]  But Sam is executive producer for O&A.  And sometimes he, I guess he's a burr in your saddle, Fez.  Is that the best way to put it?  That would be a polite way to put it.  He's a little asshole who likes the dark crap.  I can't wait.  Just, uh, it's basically a stalker to me.  Can't wait till I say something that everyone seems to find to be a fuck-up. 
[02:36:00]  That would be cake horn.  Yeah, that was yesterday's.  So now this is his new vendetta, his new flag to fly.  Fez, we're not against gays here.  Or is he just trying to bring really good audio to our attention that we could have fun with?  I think he does not like Sam Roberts.  Oh yeah, that's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  But there's like no sort of acknowledgement that he's doing this on a national radio show. 
[02:36:30]  It's not like I'm following him around with a tape recorder.  That's true.  Well, you're stalking.  It's kind of creepy that you notice every mistake the guy makes.  Yeah.  We all make mistakes and you don't ever give him a break on his mistakes.  And you come running to our show.  We don't spend two hours on every mistake.  That's true.  And out of respect for Ron Bennington.  Yes.  We could play a Fez clip every day.  I'm sure, yeah.  We could easily find a Fez clip every day.  Yeah.  It's just every once in a while, one of these over-the-top ones.  Of course we want to play it.  The stand-alone fruit blueberry thing is one of my favorite things of all time. 
[02:37:00]  I love it.  How uncomfortable that was.  What, Sam, we should play it?  What?  It failed miserably.  Oh, yeah.  We all have our failures when we're doing radio.  But that was a biggie.  You don't want to bring people up to speed with that, do you?  Stand-alone fruit?  Yeah.  Well, if Sam says we should.  Sam, you sure?  Maybe we should.  Well, I just feel like everybody needs to know what we're talking about.  That's true.  I feel like we're like...  Ah, right.  You have to harp on mistakes, though. 
[02:37:30]  I like pointing out new things.  Listen for the door, because I think that's when Ronnie actually left Fez by himself.  When I hear that door, it makes me laugh really hard.  You made him a stand-alone Fez, really.  You know, we can't bring up fruit juices without playing a clip.  Which clip is that?  This clip.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[02:38:00]  Why isn't that viral on me?  Holy shit.  That is the most uncomfortable moment in radio history.  Oh, my God.  Coke logic can animate it.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Coke logic, we're going to be a team on this.  You animate, you'll get all the fame and glory, but it's got to go on my channel.  Get to it, Coke logic.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[02:39:00]  Fruit.  Wow.  The door closing is just the best part.  Door closing's great.  Yeah.  You act like you never make a mistake, and you just keep playing this guy's mistake.  You may never, or so what?  My mistakes have been played many, many times.  Not like this, though.  They haven't been cartooned and made into giant bits. 
[02:39:30]  Are you sure?  Yeah, well, I didn't even see where he made a mistake.  You just talk about something.  We all have had our mistakes played.  We just played one of the Ants.  Famous ones.  The Dan Cow thing, right?  Dan Cow.  As a matter of fact, the Ron and Fez show, very much enjoyed the Adam Walsh clip.  Adam Walsh.  You mean the original loose clip?  Sam, cheap plug, but I just tweeted that great animation from CokeLogic.  Where can people find it?  At O&A show?  No, no.  I should have added you to the tweet, yeah.  I should have added the show's Twitter to the tweet. 
[02:40:00]  Anyway.  That's fantastic.  So we got more Fez clips?  Yeah, yeah.  Sam is on Fez's list.  What is the Fez list?  The shit list, I'm sure.  Well, it doesn't strike me as a positive thing, but Fez explains.  Don, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Hey, Fez, you're a radio legend.  Why are you letting this little piece of shit get a rub off of your heat?  How come you haven't smacked this fucking face yet?  Oh, I won't ever hit Sam. 
[02:40:30]  I won't smack Sam.  I would have bet on that.  I've got meetings today later on, but I would never hit him.  I'll just put it this way.  Sam's on my list.  Good enough.  What?  What list?  There's a list?  Yeah.  You don't need to know about it, Chris.  Chris, I will tell you this much.  It's called the least scariest list in history.  On the top of it says people I refuse to bother.  I've got Sam. 
[02:41:00]  That's all I need to say.  Sam's on it.  You hear that, Sam?  You just made the list.  I'm not going to go into any more details.  Because there are none.  John, John, you're on the Ron and Fez show.  Hey, buddy.  Is Sam's kiss on your list also Fez?  Oh, that's good.  I don't understand how that's supposed to have you back.  If you think everybody's out to get you.  I would expect the guys on my own team would have my back.  They're going to end up on your list.  There it is.  I was thinking. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, perfect.  Thank you.  Again, not being backed up here.  Are you happy with this, Sam?  You just made the pack rack list.  Now shut your cake home.  There you go.  Wow.  What list?  And what does he mean about meetings?  I don't know.  Apparently.  He's going to meet about the whole cake horn incident, which was just really good radio.  Hey, remember that.  Unfortunately at his expense, but it happens.  Why does he got to meet?  You know how ONA did great radio with my cake horn clips? 
[02:42:00]  Sam did that.  He's responsible for it.  Sounds good.  Kudos to Sam Roberts.  Maybe he's getting yelled at for something, not complaining.  Maybe he's being scolded.  This next clip, we could all agree, Fez tells the truth.  I know that Sam has written some nice things.  Oh, sure.  Sam is a fan.  Oh, yeah.  Sam puts his stuff out there to try to turn everybody completely against me.  Obviously down the hallway.  That's right.  Yeah, like Sam doesn't walk around here talking about the bosses constantly in the hallway. 
[02:42:30]  What does he say?  Oh, they're turning my show into a clip show.  Oh, I have to do a clip show.  I'm going to give you this.  It's a good impression.  It's a good impression.  He does sound like that.  But you've got to remember, we used to do the Sammy Sweetheart and Ronnie crossover.  It seemed like it had a niche audience that was enjoying it for a while.  It was the only time it was good.  Oh.  I'm team Fez.  Yeah, we can't argue with that.  I'm sorry.  Ronnie is quite a talent. 
[02:43:00]  It's authentic.  It's true.  Yeah.  Then the next clip here.  We're almost done.  Oh, and A playing clips.  Causes Fez to argue with intern Vito again.  You remember intern Vito.  Is he the soprano guy?  Oh, yeah.  He was mad.  Oh, yeah.  He was mad.  Oh, yeah.  He was mad.  Yeah.  He's the one from yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I love this guy's delivery.  Might have to steal Vito.  Go ahead.  Vito, I was ONA making fun of the way you talk. 
[02:43:30]  How'd you take that?  I was pretty pissed.  What are you upset about?  Why was Fez making fun of me on the show?  What did I do?  I was just sitting here laughing.  Everybody was laughing.  In case you didn't realize, I wasn't on the ONA show today.  Yeah, but they made fun of me because of what you yelled at me yesterday.  All I did was laugh.  I didn't do anything but laugh when everybody else was laughing.  See?  You enjoy making fun of someone?  How's it feel now?  I wasn't making fun of everybody.  I was just laughing.  What in my world?  I don't want to be in that.  I was just laughing.  You don't want to be in his world?  I don't want to be in that world.  I was just laughing.  Maybe you should have gotten the hell out of the studio when I told you to. 
[02:44:00]  I didn't want to.  I wanted to stay here.  And laugh at me.  I was laughing at everybody else.  Now, you're a big joke on the ONA show.  I'm not a big joke.  They were just laughing at me one time because you made fun of me.  Because you bullied me.  I didn't fucking bully you.  You're the one fucking laughing at me?  Joining the gang?  I even said you.  All against one gay guy?  I even said you.  And I'm the bully?  Nobody said anything about gay people.  All I did was sit here and laugh.  And everybody else was laughing.  And then when I even said I wasn't on anybody's side, you actually yelled at me and said,  I don't want you on my fucking side.  That doesn't mean anything to me. 
[02:44:30]  No, it doesn't.  Because you're just going to sit there with that big stupid grin on your face laughing.  And then I'm getting called stupid again.  Why don't you have a nice donut for yourself from Planet Donut?  As a way of making up.  It's like the apology from Fez.  Yeah, if he wants to leave me a few bucks for it, that's fine.  Stop it.  I paid for those.  Enjoy yourself.  I just love the...  I just love everybody else.  I love the Vito. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  And then finally, one more clip from yesterday as the K-Corn incident continues to go on the  Ron and Fez program.  How you doing today, guys?  I just wanted to say, I find it very funny how Fez is the biggest bully on Earth.  How am I the biggest bully on Earth?  Please enlighten us.  You only attack the weak.  You only attack the interns.  You only attack...  I've been calling out Sam all day long.  I called out Chris and Shelby all day until they dragged Vito into it. 
[02:45:30]  So just take your bullshit, your selective bullshit, and shove it up your ass like a big dildo.  There you go, and you'll attack the weak caller...  Oh, you're the...  Yes, yes, you're so weak.  Oh!  Oh, you poor thing.  Asshole.  You'll curse Vito out.  Wow.  You'll call him in names.  And I'm taking you on now, tough guy.  So what do you got to say about that, tough guy? 
[02:46:00]  Tough guy.  Tuffy?  I'm saying you're a fake.  You're a fake.  You don't even know...  How am I a fake?  I'm calling you out.  According to your theory, I would just be yelling at Norris and Vito instead of you.  Don't dare yell at Norris.  Don't drag her into this.  She's like, hey, do.  You are so uninformed.  He's noticed that you didn't attack me, ONA, Jim Norton.  You went after Sam, Vito, Shelby.  You've always had my back. 
[02:46:30]  Well, you're welcome.  Since the day I came out to you.  Well, I think even before that.  ONA and Jimmy had no idea what was going on.  Sam goes running in.  Oh, it's true.  All giddy, like a cat who found a dead mouse.  Is that a kitty?  It's true.  It's a kitty.  A kitty.  Right?  Sam runs in all kitty.  I got an inkling something was going on when I saw Kate Korn and Ron and Fez tweets all day long.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had no idea anything was happening, and he's right. 
[02:47:00]  Sam ran in here with a cackling little girl with the bad news.  People want to know what the Kate Korn shit is all about.  Kate Korn.  Just listen to Ronnie on Raw Dog Today at noon.  Sam is a troublemaker, though.  Ronnie will explain the whole Kate Korn thing for the people.  Kate Korn.  Sam likes to bully people around the place.  So.  You are quite the little bully.  Maybe.  Yeah.  There's your update.  I just love to be okay, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man. 
[02:47:30]  What did you say?  I was laughing with everyone else.  Kate Korn.  Kate Korn.  Kate Korn.  I'm not dead.  It's not a gay thing.  Kate Korn.  I guess Fez is obsessed with people that are treating him differently since he's come  out or something, because I don't really see that at all.  I think everyone's treated him the exact same way they did before.  It's because I don't think it was much of a surprise to anybody.  Of course not.  We had our assumptions for years, so whatever. 
[02:48:00]  Everyone did.  Whatever.  It has nothing to do with anybody being gay.  No.  No.  Nothing.  All right.  We got Chelsea Handler.  She should be here very soon.  Nice.  Yeah, very excited.  We haven't had her on in a few years.  Yeah.  She's plugging two big things.  Her boobies on page 143, obviously.  Nice.  As well as my Ontario, California gig this weekend.  Nice.  Big seller.  And American Degenerate can now be downloaded on my website for five bucks. 
[02:48:30]  Nice.  One guy said, don't worry.  There's a lot of fans out in California, and he's bringing a huge crew to your gig.  Oh, there you go.  We couldn't get to him.  He was on the phone.  We've got a crew.  But he swears that you'll be very happy with the turnout.  Nice.  He absolutely should come out and see Jim Norton this weekend.  Yes.  Please.  All right.  So we take a break.  Hopefully, we'll have Chelsea Handler on in a few minutes here.  Stay there.  All right.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.

The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, a Beginner's Guide. 
[02:58:00]  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to our daily lives.  Why, look, there is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this.  And I arch my asshole out.  And I fucking open the cheeks.  And I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean. 
[02:58:30]  Even on those extra messy days?  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll take a wet wipe or whatever.  And I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up.  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no, I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean. 
[02:59:00]  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow. 
[02:59:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM.  I hope you had a nice piss, Arnold.  I let it miss.  Big hairy pussy being cleaned off the mirror.  I fucked up the WWE read.  Oh, no.  Badly.  What'd you say?  It's trying to read all the arenas.  Oh, I know.  It's terrible.  The Extracto?  I did, yeah.  I'm going to try again. 
[03:00:00]  The Extracto Event Center?  Well, if you want to feel better, pull mine up from the first break.  Oh, really?  Same thing.  Yeah.  Why do we have to...  The Extracto Event Center.  What's wrong with that?  I said, what's wrong with Staples?  Staples Center.  Come on.  Because they had to sponsor all these arenas, and now they don't have personality.  Personal.  Personal.  I mean, you guys.  Personal.  Like the Boston Garden.  Yeah.  That said something.  Well, now what's the Boston Garden?  A Fleet Center, right?  Or something? 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  Or did they change it?  I don't know.  It probably changed again.  I don't know.  But I messed up that read badly, and WWE's a new sponsor.  How is Madison Square Garden still Madison Square Garden?  Shouldn't it be something?  Too iconic.  They just won't.  Madison, Madison AT&T Garden?  Oh, no.  They will, Jimmy.  There's too much money.  Eventually, right?  They will, unfortunately.  Some fucking company comes up with a big Madison Qualcomm Garden?  Yeah, because you get that logo on everything.  Yeah.  I mean, everything.  On your dumb popcorn, now you have the logo of the year. 
[03:01:00]  Madison Home and Garden.  Garden?  Garden.  Garden.  Garden.  What?  Yeah.  I apologize to the WWE.  I really, oof.  That was a bad one.  Waddle doodle.  Just reading arenas.  I know.  That's what it is.  One after another, and they're all just.  Yeah.  Sounds ridiculous.  Yeah, whatever.  What are you going to do?  Personally, I think you shouldn't, you know, what are you doing putting arena names like  that in for the whole read?  Well, that's what I said.  Sam, can't we just say they're going to be in Austin on this day?  They're going to be in San Antonio on this day.  People can figure out where they're going to be. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, where?  It's the WWE.  They're going to have the biggest space in that.  Right.  In that city.  Whatever your big arena is.  Check your local arenas for details.  Pretty much the WWE will be in that one.  Right.  I mean, and why would the WWE do that?  They're giving free plugs to all these arenas.  I am.  Not the arenas themselves, but like AT&T Center.  You just gave AT&T a free mention.  Like they need it.  Exactly.  Where's my new phone? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Where was that?  Didn't Roland set up the whole Samsung thing?  Yes.  What happened with that?  I don't know.  What are we getting?  Like a Samsung 8?  They're up to 5 and I can't wait.  And some fucking head implant that we hear things right from the phone?  What is it?  Is it out yet, the 5?  I don't know.  April.  I think you're getting the phone from her.  April.  I'm here in April.  My phone is barely hanging in there.  I think we're getting the phone from her.  What?  From her.  Scarlett Johansson on it and everything.  Oh, ScarJo.  Yeah.  Did you see the Bill Burr parody for her? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  I was just reading it, of course.  Not bad.  While you're on the turlet these days, all you do is read your phone.  Someone came up with Burr instead of her.  Really?  Burr?  You know, the Oscar-nominated movie, Her.  Deceptory.  What's going on with our phones?  Did we mess this?  Did we mess it up?  Did we mess this up?  You did.  No.  I know.  Because of the Oscars, they ran out of product. 
[03:03:00]  Something next week.  What do you mean they ran out of product?  Oh, they ran out of product.  Because of the selfie?  The selfie messed up everybody?  Every celebrity got one.  Oh.  At the Oscars.  What?  They make 200 of them?  Fucking phone.  We should have gotten some, too.  We're celebrities, right?  And Bradley Cooper owns it.  I'm not weighed down.  You know Bradley Cooper owns the photo?  No way.  Yes, because he took it.  Because he took it?  Even though he was on Ellen's phone?  If you take the photo, you own it.  Come on.  That's why photo credits are taken by.  So when somebody hands you a phone and you take a picture.  You own it. 
[03:03:30]  So that's Bradley Cooper's photo.  I don't know what you can really do with it.  Eric, what's all your photos?  What are you going to do with it?  Because everyone has already seen it.  That's right.  So who would turn around and now buy a copy of that or something?  Yeah.  Good luck getting them.  So what's the big deal?  Since it was posted, it's like public.  Well, the Oscars don't own it even.  Yeah, but it was...  Doesn't Twitter own it?  Isn't there a thing like...  No.  Once you post it, it's theirs or some shit?  It's worthless.  Who cares about that dumb picture?  It is a dumb picture.  Bunch of fucking celebrities.  Ooh!  And the brother of a celebrity freaking right in the picture. 
[03:04:00]  Kid and playhead.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So when are we getting these phones?  They're a roll.  It looks like next Tuesday.  Next Tuesday.  Yeah, we're trying to get a guy here right after.  The show.  And what, we get a watch, too?  Yep.  Give me the watch.  You're watching the phone.  I held this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass.  I know that.  And what...  So we get a watch, and what does that do?  I don't want a watch.  It talks to the phone.  They're trying to make us wear watches.  And this audio that we're now doing...  I'm sure I'm going to sound stupid in a year or two, but I don't want a watch.  Like the watch talks to the phone? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't want it.  I don't want...  And the necklace.  Oh, look.  It's a fucking eye shoe.  I don't need that.  No.  See what it is.  You could have the phone in your pocket, right?  And then your watch will go...  And then you look, and there's your text message right there on your watch.  Who cares?  And then you could talk in your watch.  You go, hey, bitch, send me some dick pics.  I look like I'm from the Secret Service.  It's fucking dumb.  And you could put your wrist right by your cock and take dick pics and then send it right  from your watch.  I stand corrected.  That sounds good now, right? 
[03:05:00]  I'm sure we're going to look stupid.  The whole world's going to, you know, accept the watch thing.  But it kind of looks...  I don't want a watch.  I saw it.  It kind of looks cool.  Yeah.  And then when it's not doing its, like, funny watch things, it's a watch.  It's got the time on there.  I like the Nike thing.  What does that do?  The watch band thing where it's like, hey, I took 10,000 steps today.  That's silly.  So fucking Apple is once again...  But it's not Apple.  It's Samsung.  ...being outdone by somebody.  Once again, that new fucking shithead CEO. 
[03:05:30]  Another lateral iPhone move.  Yeah.  Hey, this one's got the Time app.  Samsung is kicking Apple's ass.  Samsung's doing a good job.  You guys see all the Samsungs now.  You see them.  I see them.  They're everywhere.  They see the screens are better, too.  You know what?  Let me tell you something else.  This is my third Samsung, and the five will be my fourth Samsung.  The interface for the iPhone is a fuckable.  It's a lot more intuitive than the Samsung.  Okay.  That is a given.  It's easier to navigate.  And anyone with a Samsung that's right now is going, no, it's...  It just is. 
[03:06:00]  You gave up on your Samsung.  Because my battery was fucking dying, and then people are like, well, turn off this and  that and the other thing.  It's like, yeah, now I got a fucking flip phone.  Now I got a jitterbug phone.  The jitterbug.  Wait, I could use some...  My battery sucked.  I need to turn off some stuff.  No, you need a phone that fucking doesn't go through battery like crazy.  My iPhone, 99% in the morning when I wake up, it's been on my night table, loses 1% the  entire day.  I could go without it fucking, like, losing more than 10%. 
[03:06:30]  That fucking Samsung was dying so fast.  Why don't we talk to Derek, who has one of these watches?  Give me the watch.  Derek in Boston.  How are you?  Derek.  Yeah, how about that?  What are you, talking on your watch, you fucking...  Derek.  Watch trucker?  First of all, I'm from Boston, and the TD Garden is the old Boston Garden.  Which used to be the Fleet Center? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, it's called TD Bank North.  TD Bank.  That's a horrible name for an arena.  But that's just greed.  That just comes down to greed.  Anyway, what do you got?  Yeah.  So, I got that watch with the Galaxy Note 3.  The what?  And it's really cool, man.  You can set appointments, you can do, like, to-do lists, you can send text messages, and  make phone calls.  It's pretty cool.  I don't know.  I don't...  Well, I'm not ready to wear a watch. 
[03:07:30]  I kind of...  I'll give the watch a try.  I'll give the watch a try.  You will?  Yeah.  They got all types of apps.  There's Twitter on it, and, uh...  Whoa.  In this day and age, you get Twitter.  Nice.  Great.  Twitter.  That's good.  Just name the number one app.  They better have Twitter, or they'd be in deep trouble.  Give up on fucking Twitter.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, look.  Sorry, Derek.  We discouraged him from adding any more to the show.  Sorry, Derek.  I heard it.  Oh, we discouraged him. 
[03:08:00]  I apologize.  Yeah.  A little fired up today.  Chelsea Handler in a few minutes.  You want to see the Burr, um...  Yeah, what is this?  Instead of her, it's Burr.  Yeah.  It's doing very well so far.  Yeah?  We'll tweet it out on our show Twitter, which is O&A Show.  So, start following that one for all the clips we play on this show.  Could you pause for a second?  I need to set up here.  I don't even know what this movie's about.  I don't either.  Like, a computer talks to Joaquin Phoenix? 
[03:08:30]  That's why when I said you're getting the phone from her, you all looked at me like I had seven heads.  Right.  Yeah, it's like slightly in the future.  And, uh...  And the phone talks to you?  It's like Siri, except next level.  It's a whole artificial intelligence thing, and he falls in love with her.  He falls in love with her voice.  With her voice.  Come on.  Yeah, and it's Scarlett Johansson's voice.  And this was Oscar-worthy?  It was a good movie.  And who's the voice, Scarlett Johansson?  Yes.  Get focus.  Okay, great. 
[03:09:00]  Why?  Let's give it a shot.  All right.  This is Burr, though, not her.  Okay.  It's a parody.  Why couldn't it have been Norton?  Why couldn't it have been Norton?  Norton doesn't rhyme with her.  No.  Oh.  It would have worked.  That's the joke, Jerry.  Jesus.  I know it right.  Jesus.  You're just sticking up for me.  Mr. Theodore Twombly, welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system. 
[03:09:30]  Please wait as your operating system is initiated.  Fuck this.  Hi.  It's Bill Burr.  This fall.  Oh, come on now.  Good morning.  How much hotter in this fucking chicken coop is it going to get?  You're too funny.  It's not horrific, whatever that is.  White guy's sort of a moron.  Just doesn't understand.  I love the way you look at the world.  This is my gut feeling about this whole idea.  Bad move. 
[03:10:00]  What do you mean?  Your fucking life reeks of voracious reading.  You're kind of nosy.  That's kind of weird.  There's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody.  Does that bring you back to the cafeteria days where you feel like you don't have anybody to sit with?  This is an unbelievably self-serving fucking thing to be doing.  Just a man-child.  I wish I could put my arms around you.  What's that?  I wish I could touch you.  Creepy. 
[03:10:30]  I'm Spike Jones.  No, I'm not doing it.  What does a baby computer call its father?  Oh, it's a shit joke.  Data.  How empty is your fucking life?  You could have saw more of a human element without the ugliness of slavery hanging in the background.  You can take a couple feet of dick out of your ass.  There you go. 
[03:11:00]  It's a visual.  It's a visual.  Yeah, a little bit.  It's the movie trailer.  I mean, it helps when you have some level of familiarity with what it's parodying.  Yeah, no one's seen that movie.  Come on, let's be real.  Who's seen the fucking movie?  Who won an Academy Award?  You?  Spike Jones won.  You did see it.  I did.  You're a fruit.  What's wrong with you?  Seeing that crap.  Yeah, Spike Jones won an Academy Award for it.  It's a good movie.  Why don't you lose your mind because we just made fun of you?  Oh, shit. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, boy.  You should have lost your mind there.  Sam Roberts, the fucking rat.  I thought it was all in good fun.  The fez rat, you mean?  Sam?  So who won the Academy Award?  Spike Jones?  Spike Jones.  For what?  What was it?  Best Original Screenplay or something?  Maybe.  Yeah, for writing that fucking thing.  Yes.  Original Screenplay.  Yeah.  It's probably about the next level of technology where all of a sudden the intuitive personality  is much more than just answering questions but anticipating.  Artificial intelligence.  Yeah, it's artificial intelligence.  So, you know, you kind of...  But the reason the movie's good... 
[03:12:00]  There's enough of that going around.  Oh, boy.  Snarky guy.  Snarky guy.  Snarky guy.  The reason the movie's good is because you could see it happening.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it doesn't seem out of reach.  Is it reasonable?  It's quite reasonable.  Oh.  See what happening.  The concept of the movie...  Where to go to dinner?  Doesn't seem out of reach.  Hey, where can I go to dinner and then the thing talks back?  No, it's more indefinite.  Like what?  Yeah.  Like, you build a relationship with it.  What's the easiest way to Philly this weekend? 
[03:12:30]  No, it's searching for restaurants and then you're like, oh, I'm in love.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  You're hot.  No, it's different than Siri.  How are they taking it to the next level?  Because they're forming relationships where they're having conversations beyond what's  the best way to get to Philly right now.  What?  I want some, I don't know, Thai food.  Where do I go?  No.  Like, hey, how are you this morning?  Thai food within three miles.  Thank you.  Oh, I'm in love.  No.  Oh, I love you.  That's what's happening?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It messes up what you say?  I want, I want you to duck my cock. 
[03:13:00]  No, wrong.  No.  No.  How are they taking it to the next level?  You guys could probably make her in the current era.  Yeah.  In today.  Right.  Right.  You said it was in the distant future.  No, in the near future.  Near future.  So that means like, what happens when you're asking for a restaurant?  No, you don't.  All of a sudden it wants to suck your dick?  Yeah.  No.  Well, it doesn't have the technology to suck your dick.  Does it talk to them?  Yeah, she talks.  And it's like nice and sweet to them and stuff? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Artificial intelligence?  Why would it do that?  Because it's got intelligence.  And isn't it nice and sweet to like 800,000 other people?  Right.  Well, yeah, but it starts formulating...  Yuh-ha!  Yeah.  Yeah, fucking Yuh-ha.  The movie should be called Yuh-ha!  Yuh-ha!  You're in love with 30 million people.  Yuh-ha!  Because it starts formulating its intelligence based on questions you answer in the beginning.  And then as you talk to it, it becomes more intelligent.  Like, yo, I need bagels.  And then what happens? 
[03:14:00]  And then what?  What happens if I have to ask for the bagels?  If that's what you said, then it would become aware...  And the talk guy would say, why?  Do you want to put them on your cock?  No.  Cock rings?  Cock rings?  Insanity.  It would become aware that you like bagels.  All right, then what happens?  So maybe the next morning...  How do you have a relationship with someone that knows you're looking for a bagel place?  Because the next morning she'd go...  You'd go, oh, where can I get a sausage, egg, and cheese?  All right.  And then the computer would be like, you don't want a bagel this morning?  And you'd be like, funny you asked that.  Oh, I love you.  Oh, and I would have said...  I would have said, no, I don't want a fucking bagel. 
[03:14:30]  If I wanted a bagel, I would have asked for a bagel.  Well, some...  Why would that be fun?  Answer my question.  Not everybody falls in love with the computers.  I don't need another bitch in my life.  Just answer my fucking question.  Exactly.  This concept seems very stupid.  I don't like it at all.  Some people are more hostile with their operating systems, but people like Joaquin Phoenix fall  in love.  And then what?  You make out with the phone?  Yeah.  When do you do that?  Yeah, with the phone.  Do you phone, like you get a screen cap of a tongue and just start licking it? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  And who would have an easier time having sex with a phone, a woman or a man?  I would say a woman.  A woman, right?  You could vibe that shit up.  You could slide that back and forth like a credit card, get some action going.  Right.  I like that.  How does a guy shove that up his ass for the love part of this movie?  I don't think that's the love part.  Maybe you could put it on your dick and let it vibrate a little.  But that's not what it's about.  It's not about the physical intimacy.  Well, then that's stupid. 
[03:15:30]  No.  Because if you fall in love, then that's the next step.  That's what it's all about.  No, but it's also, I mean, it's interesting because...  You've got to get some penetration in.  So how do they handle that in this movie, the penetration part?  It's not a penetration thing.  It's like he has an earpiece.  Right.  And this little thing that's even smaller than an iPhone.  It's like a credit card size deal.  So you're saying this broad's a cocktease.  No.  It's not about that.  But they fell in love.  Cocktease.  So then what happens?  Cocktease.  It's an emotional connection.  Oh, please.  Oh, God.  That's so overrated, Sam Roberts.  It's emotional-ish, emotional. 
[03:16:00]  But the technology is cool because he's got the earpiece and it's wirelessly connected  to the little credit card size thing.  It's got a camera on it and you're like, I could see that happening.  So it's in your rear?  Did you say...  It's in your rear?  Oh, so you do put it in your rear.  In your rear, right?  In your ear?  You heard me.  Thank you.  The movie's not a good concept at all.  A horrible concept of a movie.  There you go.  Why is it a horrible...  It's one for best screenwriting.  Let me go to Muhammad.  That's the whole concept. 
[03:16:30]  Uh-oh.  That's the...  What do you mean, uh-oh?  We got...  You're crazy if you don't think we don't have Muslims listening to this show.  I am.  Muhammad, what do you got?  I'm saying it's a horrible concept.  You can't even take your phone with you to the bathroom.  You can't send dick pics.  Yeah.  You can't even Snapchat without having this Scarlett Johansson staring at you doing triple  chin.  Yes.  Like a fat Snapchat.  You can't even beat it in public.  Yeah.  How do you give this thing a black eye if it's acting up, Sam?  Well, you can turn it off.  Why don't you explain that one? 
[03:17:00]  You could...  But it says, like, he's just sitting on the train, and he's like, check email, and then  Scarlett Johansson will read the emails that he has.  He'll go delete that one, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And then what?  She gets involved, like, you really should delete this?  Scarlett Johansson looking at your porn emails.  Right.  Does it comment on his emails?  No, but it'll react.  Like, if he goes, oh, not that person again, then Scarlett Johansson will go, ha, ha, ha.  Does she show any jealousy?  That's right.  I mean, not her.  In this movie?  Yeah.  Thanks, Muhammad.  It's stupid.  It's a nice movie, though.  It's fucking stupid.  Nice is overrated. 
[03:17:30]  It's nice.  She's nice.  Lenny in Canada.  Lenny?  Hey, I'm a newer fan of you guys.  I'm just wondering all this shit you're talking about, Ellis.  All he says is what you guys say.  You're on your way out in October.  He respects you guys, but just because he says you're bigger, I don't know.  Why don't you shut up, you fucking kiss-ass, Ellis kiss-ass little bitch.  Shut the fuck up.  And, dude, that's not.  Dude, that's.  Hey, Lenny.  Lenny, do you want to have a real conversation, or are you going to, you know, hear what you 
[03:18:00]  you're going to just spin it?  That wasn't the tone.  He took stupid shots at us, and we were nothing but nice to the guy.  We brought him to our channel to grow his audience and possibly grow ours a little bit,  too.  And then he turns around and said what he said, that we're on our way out, that his show is  already bigger than ours.  His show's not bigger than ours.  It's not even close to bigger than ours.  And he also lied about the fact that he's the new kid in town.  He's been at it nine years.  So what do you want to talk about here?  The lies, or are you going to just, you know, or are you just going to spin it? 
[03:18:30]  You say you don't know Howard's numbers because they won't show you the books.  So how do you know that your numbers are bigger than Ellis's?  He's got more people.  You can tell by everything.  Social media, the amount of phone calls.  You could just tell.  Howard is number one with online listening.  We're a close second.  And in the summer, we actually beat Howard at times with online listening because he  takes so many damn days off. 
[03:19:00]  But Ellis is nowhere.  You asked a question, and I just answered it.  Ellis ain't in the running.  And Ellis is not even close to the top, okay?  80s on 8 beats him.  So if you want to have a real conversation, there you go.  There's your facts.  That's exactly what was told to me.  And, dude, Lenny, the reality is this.  Him saying that his show is the best show on satellite.  He has every right to say that, and we even comment about that.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You're supposed to say that about your own show.  You're supposed to feel it's the best show.  Yeah, we have no problem with that.  Exactly.  Why are you guys so mad at it?  Well, I'm explaining something to you. 
[03:19:30]  But the tone of what he said, dude, I listened to it, too.  It wasn't like, hey, man, I'm doing great.  It was, hey, I'm already bigger than ONA.  They're on their way out.  The tone of it wasn't like, hey, those guys say they're leaving.  And it's not the only instance.  I agree that was dickish.  Okay, well, hold on, Lenny.  Hold on.  He's been taking little shots like that off and on for a while, and finally we decide not to ignore it.  Lenny, if you agree it was dickish, then what is your issue?  That Anthony said, oh, he's a fucking cunt.  He's a phony.  But now you never said that before. 
[03:20:00]  But now you're saying it.  He is a phony cunt.  What do you want from me?  You never said that before.  You never said, oh, I always hated him.  What was this when he was in?  Well, because I was being cordial to a guest on our show, dummy.  Now that he's being a dick, I'm saying.  But ask anyone around the studio.  I used to say it off the air all the time.  Exactly.  Behind his back.  Not behind his back.  He knew how I felt.  He heard about it.  I fucking said it on Twitter.  I said, but I was being courteous to a guest on our show. 
[03:20:30]  You stupid shit fuck.  Shut up.  Eat your mother's asshole, you fucking douche cunt.  Shut up.  Shut it.  Oh, now I'm racist.  Now I'm racist.  Shut up, you liberal piece of dog shit.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You 15-yard lover.  Boy.  Jimmy can explain it to you.  Jimmy, explain why that clip was bothersome.  Yeah, Lenny, that's... 
[03:21:00]  Thanks for the call, Lenny.  He hung up, by the way.  I listened to it, too.  And why it annoyed me was for that purpose.  Because it wasn't said, like, hey, these are guys I like.  It was, you know, I'm already bigger than their show.  They're on their way out.  Like, it was a dick thing to say about guys that have treated you well.  Yeah.  And there was no reason for it.  Sorry I upset a bunch of 40-year-old skateboarders.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, look out.  I'm extreme.  We were nothing but nice of the guy. 
[03:21:30]  Exactly.  Gave him a very good shot to grow his show through our audience.  Blow me.  And then, you know...  God, I can't stand it.  He took some other shots here and there.  Why would you call him up like that?  Defending Jason Ellis.  Whatever.  I'm sure he has his fans.  Whatever.  I'm sure he does.  If he thinks he's the best show, that's fine.  But to say that you're already bigger than us, that's an insult to us and what we've done  with our careers.  And it's a fact that you're not even close to bigger than us.  And to say that you're the new guy when you've been at it for nine years, that's another lie. 
[03:22:00]  Correctamundo.  So, that's all I'm saying.  Oh, God.  Chelsea Handler's out there.  Oh, is she?  Or did they take her that way?  I don't know.  We should go right or left.  We should get her in.  Yeah.  We should just bring her in.  Yeah.  Just bring her in.  Oh, oh.  We need a little camera.  Oh, it's right over there.  Yeah.  We've got to set her up.  Yeah.  Take a quick break.  All right.  We'll be back with Chelsea Handler.  Hopi and Anthony will be right back.  You got me right where you want me to be.

[03:27:00]  With Wiki.  Like, my, my pool, the water level got so high that I have to pump some out.  Like, I understand.  Meanwhile, you know, there's people starving.  I think people are dying in the Ukraine or something.  But, you know, my goddamn pool.  Let me get that open by April.  I hope so.  I do, too.  I miss that pool.  God damn it.  I just miss being outside.  I know.  Just going outside.  It's so weird.  Something as simple as going outside. 
[03:27:30]  It's just been crazy.  Brutal.  I think we're just about done, though, right?  Yeah, I hope so.  We'll probably get one freak snowstorm, but it'll melt the next day.  Oh, 45 this weekend.  45.  Is it?  What day?  They're saying.  Friday and Saturday.  It's parade day Sunday in Huntington.  Oh, the great St. Paddy's Day parade in Huntington.  Yeah, my brother does a really good job, and he's got a great spot for the parade.  Mysterious people allowed in the Huntington parade?  Mysterious people?  I think they do the Mysterious parade later on or something, the summer or something. 
[03:28:00]  But do they allow Mysterious people in their parade?  Because New York City does not.  Do you have legs?  Then you're allowed in the parade.  It's the worst parade ever, because they let the whole town march.  But they don't have banners that, like, say, we are gay Irish people.  No, no.  That's what they want in New York City, and that's what happened.  Hi, Chelsea.  Welcome back to the show.  Sit down.  We're talking about the parade in New York City and the gays and stuff.  The gay parade?  The gays.  The gay parade?  No, actually, the St. Paddy's Day parade, because they don't allow gays.  Hey, Jim.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good. 
[03:28:30]  We hate parades in general.  Parades are pretty gay.  It's like a waste of time.  It's like 1800s entertainment.  It's like, who stands there and watches that garbage?  I don't know.  People who don't have anything going on are people who can't just get somewhere else.  It's a bad traffic blockage.  Don't you think?  I think most of the people watching the parade just want to cross the street.  But I don't know why adults are into parades.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do adults be into something else?  Well, because they got their kids, so you sit there.  It's a good way to get your kids to... 
[03:29:00]  It doesn't care either.  You keep the kids occupied for an hour.  You give them Legos, and they're happier than standing in the cold for a dumb parade.  But my hometown parade, which is happening Sunday for St. Paddy's Day out there on Long Island,  they let the whole town march.  If you have legs, you can be in the parade.  I was one of those where anyone with a beer in their hand and that cardboard shamrock hat...  So what are you looking at?  That's stupid.  I mean, I guess they're just getting shit-faced, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And marching along.  Oh.  Well...  Anyway, that's what we were talking about as you were walking in.  Well, thank you.  No big...  Whatever.  Whatever.  You're stepping me in on that. 
[03:29:30]  That's a great start, right?  Yeah, that's awesome.  Super hyped up.  We defended you just yesterday.  Oh, what did I do?  For that bullshit.  The Oscars.  Oh, the stupid...  Outrage because of your tweet.  Wow, that was crazy.  What about adopting New Peter Lange?  Yes.  Angelina Jolie adopting her?  That one, and the fact that...  You're going to be kidding me.  You're going to actually tie-in with your new book and 12 Years a Slave, which is a natural tie-in.  Go to Africa or buy my book.  Right. 
[03:30:00]  Which is not...  What's so controversial about saying that?  First of all, I meant go to Africa or you can...  If you can't go to Africa, this book is also about Africa.  Right.  Whatever.  I'm so sick of explaining myself.  I don't really care.  Exactly.  You're kind of beyond getting in trouble, though.  You don't seem like you have to apologize.  A lot of guys get a little bit of heat and they have to say...  They get nervous.  Well, if you start apologizing, then you can never stop.  You can't apologize.  You know who the best is at that?  Ann Coulter.  She doesn't say shit.  She doesn't apologize for anything.  And people leave her alone.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  She's...  Yeah, she's a nightmare.  But she can say whatever the hell she wants with impunity.  It's great.  Yeah, but I mean, that's her shtick, yeah.  Right.  But she's kind of trying to piss people out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm not actively trying to piss people out.  You're trying to make people laugh.  I just...  Or, yeah.  There's a difference.  Well, Ann Coulter might be trying to make people laugh, but she's not that funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you crazy liberal, or what?  I'm not a crazy liberal, but I'm a liberal.  Are you?  Yeah, yeah, totally.  How's that working out for you?  It's not...  No, it's not not working out. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, you're like a real crazy Obama fan?  No, no.  Okay.  I'm not a crazy Obama fan.  All right.  I was an Obama fan, but it's not...  Yeah, it's not working out.  You know, I'm liberal.  I want to be liberal, but he's not great right now.  What do you find disappointing about him?  Because a lot of people who are really liberal say that he kind of let them down.  Yeah, no, I feel the same way.  I feel like a little bit of a letdown.  I mean, not a little bit, a lot.  I just think it's a disaster.  You know, I mean, everything...  The one thing that you were looking forward to after everything fell by the wayside is, you know,  it was the Obamacare, and then they roll that out, and it's a disaster. 
[03:31:30]  And you're like, oh, my God, you guys, come on, get it together.  It's one thing that you think, okay, this could be a good legacy.  This could get people in the right...  You know, and then they keep changing the rules on it.  And I don't know.  You know, he's just...  He doesn't seem like...  Now when I hear him speak, it's kind of...  I don't have the same feeling that I have.  You don't believe him.  I'm just like, why are you even bothering talking to Netanyahu?  You're not going to get anything done over there?  What are you going to say?  It's carried over to everything he's doing now.  Foreign affairs, domestic issues, everything.  No one believes him anymore.  The Olympics, I mean, I know that's not solely his...  That's, you know, the Olympic Committee, the IOC decides where the Olympics go. 
[03:32:00]  But, you know, Russia...  Why would we have the Olympics there?  Why would you reward that guy with the Olympics?  Right.  Why would anyone give that to him?  I mean, I know that happened years ago, but still, it's just terrible.  He's a Bond villain, that guy.  Yeah, he's a terrible...  That's exactly what he is.  Fucking shirtless fishing.  You have to respect any leader that wants to be photographed shirtless in the fishing boat.  I took that photo, actually, when he was shirtless fishing.  We were actually dating him for a short period of time.  Lovely.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's pretty sexy.  Yeah, he is. 
[03:32:30]  He loves to have his shirt off.  Does he ever.  It's not just one picture.  It's every other picture.  Would you bang him for the story?  Bang Putin?  No, I can't have sex with a guy like that.  No.  It's a disaster.  He's so...  I hate him.  He's probably a sub.  He is.  I bet he's a sub because he's so, like...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  A good iron fist.  Fucking the Gimps ball gag and fucking just loves fisting.  Yeah.  Yeah, gross.  Something like that.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine?  Sorry to hear that.  No, I'm just thinking about him fisting.  Yeah, that feels so good.  Oh, that would be horrible. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, he meant you fisting Putin.  Oh, yeah.  Him being a big sub.  That would be hard.  A big sub.  I haven't never fisted anyone, so that would be really hard.  I had an ex that kind of didn't want to be fisted, but she liked four...  Like, the turn-on for her would be to take...  I don't have very big hands, but I'd get four fingers in.  Like, when you make the same thing as when you're making a shadow puppet of a duck on  the wall.  Yeah, we didn't look at it that way, but that's probably really awkward.  Yes.  And I would taunt her, like, how I was going to close it into a fist, and that was what 
[03:33:30]  would get her off the fucking idea of it.  But the fisting is just a little much.  Right.  Yeah.  Fisting, yeah.  It's a lot for a person to handle.  That certainly is.  You've got to really, really ramp up to that.  There is something going on that's more than just put something large in my ass.  That is, like, some kind of deep-seated thing.  How do you get that conversation going?  Like, I need a fist in there.  I've been naughty.  Yeah, no.  Yeah.  You think it's symbolic of something else, or is it more like, ah, this feels good, because 
[03:34:00]  it just...  I don't know.  When I think about that, my brain just shuts in.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't really dwell on that too much.  Yeah, no, I can't.  No, it's awful.  Did Chewy do porn?  Someone showed us something.  Is that true or no?  Yeah, Chewy did porn.  Yeah, apparently.  I had never...  I've never seen it, and I don't want to, but we found out about, like, two years into  the show.  Oh, okay.  My ex, Ted, called me and was like, okay, Chelsea, I was driving, and I lived with him  at the time, and he's like, I need...  We've got some very bad news, because we found out, and I didn't tell Ted, because he's,  like, you know, a histrionic mess, and I said, you know, and I... 
[03:34:30]  And we...  And he called me, and he was like, I've got some bad news.  You know, I need you to pull over, because I was driving.  Oh, shit.  What do you mean pull over?  Please don't tell me to pull over.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I got bad news.  Pull over.  Just say it.  It's so annoying for somebody to say that.  Are you alone?  You're going to think so.  Say what you've got to say.  No, and then he told me, he goes, Chewy was in a pornographic film, and I'm like, of course  he was.  He's a Mexican little person.  What else was he supposed to do?  Oh, you weren't shocked or upset by it? 
[03:35:00]  No, I had known, but I didn't tell Ted, because I knew he wouldn't react normally.  But whatever.  I mean, what was he supposed to do?  Thank God we rescued him from that situation.  Yeah, he's like, I've been on your show, and when he's announced, it's a tremendous...  They love him.  They fucking love that guy.  They love him.  They love him.  People love him.  People don't understand.  I mean, I love him, too.  You know, he's a nugget.  He's my nugget.  I saw him.  He's so cute, but he's so lazy.  How did you discover him?  I just saw him, and I like to have a thing for little people.  I have an application on my phone called Nugget Grinder, and they tell me when a little 
[03:35:30]  person is within 20 yards.  Come on.  Because the little person has to actually put in that he's a little person somewhere.  Yeah, they do their dimensions, and their measurements, and their waist.  If they're close, do you seek them out?  And they do what activity, because you can find them at work.  You can find them crossing the street or playing sports.  It's adorable.  Thank you.  Do they object to that app?  Do they find that, like, little...  They do...  No, because they have to sign up for it.  Yeah, they would have to actually put in.  Yeah, so there's a membership fee.  Right. 
[03:36:00]  If you see a little person, and they didn't pop up on your phone, you probably shouldn't  approach them and say, hey, you should get on this.  I bet they would be upset.  Well, there's a very high kidnapping rate for little people in L.A.  Really?  Yeah, people grab them and put them into cars.  Yeah, they tag them, and then they release them.  Tag and release.  And natural environment.  Set them free in other areas where they can't be harmful to the indigenous population.  Yeah.  I guess Midget is really offensive now.  Like, we don't...  But you're close with Chewy.  Is that something that, like, he said to you, like, that's a term that, like, does bug 
[03:36:30]  us, and this is why?  Yeah, you can't say the M-word.  He doesn't like that.  The M-word.  They're actually...  The NFL is trying to ban that, too.  Yeah, it's like saying the F-word for a gay guy, I guess.  You know, they don't like it.  So, you can't say it.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that the one?  Yeah, because I'm always interested, like, when I hear these words that offend people, I'm  like, ah, I don't care.  But then sometimes if that person explains it to you, it's like, ah, it's kind of  hard to argue it.  Well, no, you can't.  Yeah, you can't use words like that.  I mean, that's...  You just have to respect people's wishes.  So, of course I do.  I mean, he...  Oh, man.  He doesn't like Midget? 
[03:37:00]  No.  No.  Little person?  Little nugget.  I think little person sounds more demeaning than Midget, to be honest.  Well, Midget has...  Yeah.  If we're little people, oh, are you...  Or you can call him little fucker.  Little fucker.  Hey, little fucker.  Now, that's a fun thing to call somebody.  Keeps it fun for everybody.  Yes.  You had a funny...  I literally...  We just got this an hour before you got here.  Unfortunately.  And I opened it up to page seven, and there's a really funny line, because this is about  you going to Africa, I guess?  Yeah.  Well, it's all my travel stories.  They're just true stories, though.  But it starts with Africa. 
[03:37:30]  I went on safari.  It's called Uganda Be Kidding Me, and it is out now.  And it's...  When did Africa come up?  I thought you were going to the south of France.  I want to know where rappers came from.  You know, that's always been a passion of mine.  It's the first thing I read, and it was funny.  That's hilarious.  Oh, you're going to be in Dutch for that one.  Have you caught any flack about the book?  Apparently, white people are...  Very difficult time, actually, talking about anything about black people.  I don't know.  I don't...  I mean, I try not to read anything about myself.  Yeah? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  What's the point?  I don't know.  Does it bother you still?  Like, the negative...  I mean, it's a comic.  I know how we are, but does it bother you?  Well, no.  I just don't do it.  I just don't...  I don't read it.  You don't go on Twitter?  No.  I think my assistant's disabled, so I can't even read it.  Oh, really?  No.  Yeah, you used to be on, right?  No, I'm on Twitter.  Oh, okay.  But I have, like, an application where I can tweet.  I can take a photo and tweet it or write something if I want to write to a tweet.  But you don't have to read any of that shit?  I don't read it.  What's the point?  I mean, I don't...  I don't know.  I don't like to do that.  It's like that self-flagellation.  No, I'd rather read the paper, honestly.  Yeah?  I'm sick of social media. 
[03:38:30]  I just don't want to read...  You know people are going to write, you know, stuff about you.  Terrible things.  Oh, horrible things.  It's fine.  You have to have a really, like, sick kind of relationship with yourself to be interested in that.  Is it that?  Or maybe, like, there's a self-confidence issue or something.  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Like, I read horrible things about myself, but I really don't care.  It used to bother me a lot back in, like, the early 2000s and stuff when we were kind of just starting.  Now, though, I can read heinous things and I'm just like, what? 
[03:39:00]  It doesn't bother me at all.  Yeah, that's good.  But after a while, you become numb to it anyway.  That might be it.  Yeah.  Desensitized.  Because most people who are writing stuff aren't, like, really...  I mean, if you're sitting there blogging about somebody or talking about how much you hate  someone, obviously you've got some issues, because shouldn't you be using your time more  wisely?  I have spent hours, though, researching people that have bad-mouthed me.  Uh-huh.  You go to their Instagram.  You put their names.  You find their real name.  You put them in search engines.  You put them in a tracking thing.  And you get every bit of information about their wife, kids, jobs. 
[03:39:30]  And then you just talk horribly about their family.  Your kid is ugly and fat.  He handles fucking Twitter people like the Zetas cartel.  You basically just find their family, cut their throats.  I hold a grudge like the JDL.  But it doesn't bother you, you said.  All right, some do.  Okay.  But I have a solution to that.  Just know there's shitty people out there.  Yeah, there's horrible people.  That's what Twitter, you know, taught all of us.  Yeah.  A lot of shitty people in the world.  And you're interesting, too, it's like when somebody, it's almost like an online heckle. 
[03:40:00]  It's hard not to address it sometimes.  Because it's just like the fucking balls on this.  Yeah, if you're on stage performing, you're going to get people heckling you.  Does that bother you?  I mean.  You don't get people heckling you.  No?  No.  I mean, who's going to heckle me?  They're coming to a theater with like thousands of people.  Dummies.  You're going to scream out and yell at me?  Some people are.  You're going to, you know, I'll tear you apart.  You have the power.  Well, I mean, most people that are paying money to come see you.  Yeah.  You know, are not there to scream at you.  That's true.  You're going to ruin everyone else's show and then you're going to make a fool out of yourself. 
[03:40:30]  I've seen them in the crowd do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not fun.  It's lame.  You have to be really shit-faced.  They'll yell sometimes if they're there to see you.  They'll yell things that are fun or that they're not trying to hurt you.  They're trying to be a part of it.  Like they'll just, you know, you'll be in the middle of a punchline.  They'll, you know, maybe, chewy or whatever it is that they'll yell for radio shit.  Right, right, right.  And that's even more annoying than someone who's trying to wreck your show.  Yeah.  Because you can't hammer them that hard.  It's like, they're all your fans.  Yeah, they're fans.  What are you going to do?  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're irritating. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, no, I mean, you know, most of your fans are pretty cool about it.  I mean, it's just so stupid to do.  It depends on kind of, you know, certain parts of the country.  It's a little rougher.  Yeah.  Are you doing a gig in D.C. tonight?  I'm doing D.C. tonight, Cleveland tomorrow, and then I'm doing the Garden, the Theater  on the Garden Saturday night, two shows.  Wow.  So you're going from here to Cleveland and then back here?  I'm coming back here for a first Saturday show, yeah.  I go D.C., Cleveland, Boston, two shows of Boston, then Saturday, here, then Chicago, 
[03:41:30]  Sunday night.  All in the next five days.  Yeah, it's the first week of the book launch, so you've got to bang it out.  Yeah, the first two weeks are the big ones for the bestseller.  And you've got four on the bestseller list.  And you're smart to go out and promote it like this.  It's like you go out and do gigs.  Well, listen, you know, when they pay you this much money to write a book, you better  go out and make them their money back.  Right.  It's the right thing to do, I think.  Yeah.  But I always get the spreadsheets, and they're always like, well, no, we're still in the  red.  Like, you're never going to see back-end on books.  You had a great book.  I loved your book.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  But you never see back-end on them.  They'll never, never, ever, because there's always a way they can spin it. 
[03:42:00]  Like, well, a distribution fee, like they fucking take 30% off the top.  That's why you've got to get a big advance, so that they have to pay you no matter  what.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  But it's good to go out and promote your book.  You know, it's good.  And plus, I like to go on the road.  I don't get to go, you know, I'm in L.A. all the time, so I don't get to go to places  like Cleveland.  I don't get to go hang out and see fans, and they like that.  It's nice.  It's nice to see them.  It's nice to do book signings.  You know, you say thank you, like a real person.  Like a real human.  It's nice to do that, I think.  This isn't like an idea for a book that you would think, like you would put out. 
[03:42:30]  What's the story behind it?  It's just, oh, no, it's all, they're all the same.  It's all the same as my other books, it's just about me going, I take my girlfriends  and my families, and you know, I go on vacations, or my, you know, whatever guy I'm dating at  the time, and then I write about it.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, only really funny stories I think are really funny and that I want to  share.  You know, some of them are really embarrassing, and I figure I should share those too, so that  everybody knows that they're not the only person who shit their pants.  So you indeed did go to Africa, and this is like your role. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I went to Africa, I went to, there's a story about the London Olympics, I went there,  went to Yellowstone, I tore my ACL skiing in Switzerland, and got medevaced off the mountain  by a bunch of German Nazis, and was on ecstasy, there's a story about that.  Nice.  Where were you on ecstasy?  In Switzerland.  I took it by accident, I meant to take an Excedrin.  Oops.  And then I realized, like halfway down the mountain, I'm like, I think I might have taken an ecstasy.  Now, why did you even have ecstasy?  Because I liked to party.  All right.  That's good.  That's like a Kennedy thing with the Ambien. 
[03:43:30]  No, no, I wasn't driving.  Oh, okay.  Do you believe her excuse?  Oh, hell no.  Well, why would she take an Ambien and go out?  Just because she was all fucked up, you mean?  Maybe, yeah.  She was like, I don't know.  I mean, the Kennedy, I liked her quote yesterday, that they shouldn't be investigating all drunk  driving.  Yeah.  It's a waste of time.  It's a waste of time.  That's great to say.  No, I was talking to my doctor, because I used to take Xanax, and I wanted to stop taking it,  and I got off of it, and I had this sleep specialist I went to, and he said, you know,  I take the Sonata now when I can't sleep or if I'm on the road, and he said, when you 
[03:44:00]  take it, he goes, you know, you can't take it past like four in the morning, and I go,  what if I wake up at four and I want to go back to sleep?  He goes, but you have to understand, like, if you wake up at nine and you go to work,  that's still in your system.  So then, you know, you're like Kennedy.  And I said, oh, okay, thank you for telling me.  He goes, if you're up at four, you're going to fall back asleep if you give yourself, even  if it takes an hour.  I said, okay, good.  And, you know, once he said that, you're like, you can't take a sleeping pill before you go  driving.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not ideal.  The Kennedys are hot messes.  They're always getting into trouble with sleeping pills.  Yes, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, they love their drugs and alcohol. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Why were you taking Xanax?  Just to sleep?  To go to sleep.  Yeah, because, you know, when I'm traveling and stuff, like, if I get home on a Monday  and I've been on the road for all weekend, I want to catch up on my weekend because I've  been, you know, out.  And so I'd go out to bed at, like, seven, take a Xanax and sleep for ten hours.  And it's like, you can't do that.  That's probably a bad habit.  By the way, I stopped taking it.  Like, your whole brain comes back into focus.  It's the worst stuff.  It totally denudes your creativity, you know, your word retrieval.  You can't think of the things when you're taking that stuff all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's better not to. 
[03:45:00]  I think I'm a terrible sleeper.  Like, you know, three hours a night.  Oh, my God.  It's awful.  So I try once in a while a melatonin or something to help me, like five milligrams of melatonin,  but I can't fuck with any of that stuff.  Jimmy's been trying to figure this out for years.  And does it work?  It helps a little bit, but only for a night or two.  And then your body just adjusts to it, and then you've got to take more.  So it's like, it doesn't...  That's so lame.  Yeah, it sucks.  Well, he wears a mask, too.  I try to.  That doesn't help.  An eye mask?  No, the apnea mask.  Yeah, it doesn't work.  That is humiliating.  You're a real friend with that mask?  No, that tends to dry up the vag immediately. 
[03:45:30]  And you fucking see that on the counter.  You have to put that on at the end of the night.  That's brutal.  It's satisfying.  You've got to find someone who really loves you.  Yeah, or someone that's dated a guy like that before, or just somebody who's got a really  bad living situation and likes a nice fucking clean apartment to stay in four nights a week.  You deal with that Darth Vader noise all fucking night long?  Yeah, I guess it's better than snoring, though.  Did you really shit your pants?  I heard you say that in there somewhere.  I had an accident in a kayak, and there's a chapter about it called The Bahamas.  Nice.  So, yeah, it wasn't great, but I thought... 
[03:46:00]  It wasn't great.  It wasn't a big accident.  I wasn't in pants, though, no.  What was the issue?  Food poisoning, or just...  The issue was I was in Africa for like two weeks, and I didn't go to the bathroom for  a long time, and then I went to The Bahamas, and Africa left my body without any way.  Why didn't you go to the bathroom?  Could you not, or are you triggered you to avoid the bathrooms?  You can't go.  I mean, I just couldn't go.  The food is so bad.  I didn't drink that much, and I just drank alcohol.  That's not really good for...  Nice.  A little maybe dehydrated. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Is the food really bad?  I've heard that before.  It's not great in Africa, no.  I mean, it's an amazing trip, and it's so beautiful and amazing.  I mean, it totally is amazing.  You can't believe what you're seeing, but yeah, you don't go there for the food.  Did you stay out?  Because Jim Brewer went, and he went with James Hetfield, and he said that they stayed outside  in like tents, and like you really, you are in the jungle, like the...  The Sopana.  Yeah, whatever the fuck it is.  And you know, there's animals, and he said it was actually...  What was the one that they were scared of?  The rhino, right?  Yeah, there was a rhino when he went out. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And even the locals were like, they don't...  They're scared of rhinos.  The hippopotamus are like crazy.  Was it the hippo?  Maybe it was a hippo.  I think it might have been the hippo.  Those are the ones that will fuck you up, yeah.  It was one of those two.  Yeah, they're all well.  They're not...  You can't get out of the car on safari.  They're not...  None of them are going to be friends with you.  No.  I tried to.  I said, can't I just get...  I just want to pet that lion.  I know he's not going to attack me.  And our safari guy was like, no, no, you cannot get out of the car.  You don't understand.  I'm not going to save you.  Yeah.  They have guns on them because they will, you know...  They don't care about the cars that you pull up to.  You're within five feet of a lion or, you know, a den of lions. 
[03:47:30]  It's just...  It's unbelievable.  Just staring at you.  You just stare at them for an hour.  Like, you just stare at them.  You can't believe it.  You know, they're all bloody from whatever they ate.  Yeah, they're not like Simba.  No.  No.  It's not...  Not all cute and cuddly.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I like?  And the food is great in Africa.  And the animals, you see that?  Animal Kingdom.  Disney.  Epcot.  Things like that.  Right, right.  I love that.  Oh, it's perfect.  Well, you should go there by yourself.  That's what I do.  I just go there and eat. 
[03:48:00]  The Bronx Zoo.  It's a wonderful, wonderful time.  They're all cleaned up nice at the Bronx Zoo.  Yes.  They're not all bloody at the Bronx Zoo.  You don't need that.  They're brushed.  Right.  It's a wonderful experience.  Do you stay in hotels or do you actually stay outside?  You stay in, like, tents.  Like, I mean, they're very nice.  No, but they're, like, you know, five-star.  It's not hard.  Five-star tent?  Five-star tents.  Yeah, it's like, you know, you've got butler service.  Like, you're not roughing it.  There are other ways to do it, but I'm not, like, I don't like that.  Yeah.  I'm not into camping.  Is there a big difference between Africans and African-Americans? 
[03:48:30]  Did you notice when you went there?  Yeah, I would say so.  Yeah?  Well, Africans are serious.  You know, there's, like, tribes.  Right.  They're, like, in, you know, they have five wives.  Yeah.  There's stuff, like, you're in a different world.  Oh, that's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have five wives.  Yeah.  Like, this guy was, you know, all the people, they, you know, there's all these different languages  they speak or dialects, and, you know, they tell you about, it's, like, it's crazy.  Did you feel in danger at all, or were you, like, you felt totally comfortable and safe  the whole time?  No, I felt safe the whole time. 
[03:49:00]  You did?  Yeah.  I mean, they take good care of you.  Yeah.  And one thing I love about you is that you talk about everything in your life, like,  no matter how embarrassing it is.  And I've gotten, I've had girlfriends that have been upset, even if I don't reference them,  never by name, but they're, like, that's my private life.  And it's, like, well, it's mine, too.  How do guys you date handle it?  You know, I don't know.  They just have to deal with it.  If they don't, I don't really date them.  I mean, I don't, you know, if somebody really doesn't want me to talk about them, I won't.  If they have children, I get that.  I'm kind of more respectful of that.  But if it's just a guy who's got no kids, I'll probably talk about him. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want to embarrass anybody's parent, like, kids.  So, but that's why I don't have any kids, so I can't embarrass my own.  Do you have long-term relationships, or are they, like...  I try not to.  Try not to?  Yeah.  I'm not into long-term relationships.  I mean, I'm kind of living a great life.  I'd like to keep it that way for a while.  What usually goes wrong first?  For me, it's once I have somebody, I just desire to text other people.  It's really hard for me to be happy.  Yeah, I know.  Really?  You're all fucked up, though. 
[03:50:00]  I'm a disaster.  Yeah, you shouldn't be doing that.  I know.  If you don't want to be with somebody, you could...  Oh, look at this guy.  Sam Roberts.  Hey, Sam.  The wonderful Sam Roberts.  You think he's black?  He's got a big pubic mound on his head.  He says he's not black.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, though.  No, I don't think he's black.  Are you?  I can tell that you're...  He really is related to Thomas Jefferson.  We think Thomas Jefferson used to make a few trips out to the...  And we know what he used to do.  Yeah, I can connect the dots.  It is downtime, right?  Yeah.  So we think something's going on there.  We had him tested, though.  He's not black, supposedly. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  Supposedly.  Did they have you tested?  Yeah.  And what are you?  It said I was Puerto Rican.  I don't trust it.  I think you look a little Puerto Rican.  Yeah?  Yeah, I can believe that.  Yeah, you got a little out of it, yeah.  He's not black.  No, but he looks like the hair is just weird.  There's something going on that's a little odd.  Sam, you ruined our interview by walking in.  No, I don't think he did.  I think he added to it.  We had a good flow going with Chelsea Handler.  Can I take a picture of you, Sam?  Do you mind?  Oh, man.  I can send this to my genealogist.  What is this?  Exactly. 
[03:51:00]  What the hell is this thing?  What is this thing I found roaming?  That's nice.  Oh, don't pose for the pictures.  Oh, you don't worry.  Just stand there.  What are you doing?  What is that?  Dr. Seuss character.  Don't yell at him.  He's like the thinker.  He's not sensitive.  We only have two minutes left, I'm hearing.  Chelsea's very busy.  We've got to make sure we promote the book properly.  You've gone to be kidding me.  And I see you squatting here.  Is that a poo?  Oh, no, I don't do that.  Who is that then?  Is that one of your friends?  No, that's me going to the bathroom in Africa.  I'm just peeing.  I want to take a picture of me going to the bathroom. 
[03:51:30]  There's also a shot of you hanging off the boat.  I don't know if you're...  It looks like you're peeing off the side of a boat, or is that not what you're doing?  Yeah, I'm peeing off the side of a boat.  That's great.  Yeah, I mean, in Africa, you have to just pee wherever.  So I just took my pants down and did it.  That's just great that you put that in the book, though.  Oh, absolutely.  There's a lot of great pictures in there.  It makes me happy to pee outside.  I hadn't done it in so long.  Did you have to get inoculated for a lot of things?  Yeah, you have to get a hepatitis A, hepatitis B shots.  You have to make sure you...  See, she understands shitting and peeing outside. 
[03:52:00]  I've never taken a Shadubi outside.  Dude, it's Africa.  It's Africa.  I poo at beaches.  At beaches?  Inside the water?  In the water?  Outer Banks, a beach, and my house was a little further back.  In North Carolina?  So I took my morning poo and then let the tide take it out, and the birds eat it.  Oh, God.  What's wrong with that?  That's so fucked up.  What's wrong with that?  I mean, what did the ocean ever do to you?  I got lazy, and my mother-in-law was coming back from a walk.  Your mother-in-law?  Why would you involve her in this?  She was wondering...  She was kind of confused why the birds were feasting. 
[03:52:30]  Were the seagulls swooping in?  They came out of nowhere, these birds.  Sorry, Chelsea.  I apologize.  I thought we could relate, but you don't poo outside.  You don't eat.  I had an accident, and I talked about that.  I would never intentionally go to the bathroom outside.  Number two.  Number one is fun.  And it was a four-by-four beach.  I could have got back in the car and went back.  Nice, but what are you going to do?  There's something...  There is something...  My only shitting outdoors experience when I was a kid, me and my friend were going to  steal comic books, and I had to shit desperately, and I shat in the woods, and there were 
[03:53:00]  yellow jackets flying between my legs.  Like, I was shitting by a beehive, and I didn't know it, and so I just said I'll never shit  outdoors again.  Wow.  That's my one and only shit outdoors again.  I'll never shit outdoors again.  See what happens.  Sometimes the bees go away, and sometimes they don't go away.  Look what happened to this interview.  We can't end it on shit stories.  It definitely degenerated.  We actually stayed out of it longer than I thought it would.  Yeah.  I'm glad, you guys.  You should respect yourselves more.  We almost made it.  We almost made it.  The book is You Gotta Be Kidding Me. 
[03:53:30]  Chelsea is a brilliant writer and fucking truly hilarious.  Thanks, Jim.  I think you're hilarious.  Thank you very much.  And book signing today in Washington, D.C. at Politics and Prose, and you can see her  tonight.

Just go to ChelseaHandler.com and get all the books, because there's 50 dates here.  The book signing made the paper today, because she brought an iPod and cranked up some tunes. 
[03:54:00]  What paper?  In one of the papers, they're talking about you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and they thought it was a little weird, because, you know, bookstores are supposed  to be, I guess, quiet or something.  No, you've got to keep it energy up.  And you pumped up a couple tunes to get everyone into it.  Oh.  Do you read at the book signing?  I don't know why that was a story today, but it was in the paper.  No, I don't.  Do I read?  No.  You just kind of go up and sign, right?  Yeah, I sign books.  Yeah.  It's nice.  I think it's nice.  People come up, and like you said, you speak to them personally.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  You want to sign books for people.  You got to. 
[03:54:30]  It means something.  They tell you a story.  You act interested.  Oh, boy.  God bless.  Thank you.  Let's get her out here.  Chelsea, thanks for coming.  Thanks, guys.

Opie and Anthony have been creating radio gold for 20 years.  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history, here's our 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem. 
[03:59:00]  Hey, we gotta introduce intern David to the audience.  Yeah.  Here he is.  How you guys doing today?  Yay!  Introduce yourself.  These are our fans.  It's good to see everybody come out for the show today.  I'm Dave.  I'm the new intern for Opie and Anthony.  Isn't it like watching an exhibit at the ZJU? 
[03:59:30]  Tell them a little bit about yourself, David.  I'm Dave.  I'm from North Jersey.  I'm studying broadcasting, radio, TV broadcasting, and really excited for this internship.  Are you looking to be a broadcaster or just run it?  No, no.  No, I'm a broadcaster.  You know how it goes.  I'm looking to be a broadcaster as opposed to running and being producing.  I'm looking to be on air eventually.  We're going to show you one of the hottest porns going today.  Just a clip.  And I want you to describe it for the audience, okay?  Whose opinion is it that it's the hottest porn going? 
[04:00:00]  Oh, look at this David.  Hey, he's getting cocky.  He raises a good point, though.  Three hours in, he's getting cocky.  Yeah.  Where am I watching this?  Oh, he's getting demanding and pushy.  All right.  For the audience, I want you to describe what's going on.  This is two girls, one cup, my friend.  Here we go.  Describe it.  That's pretty nice.  Good description.  You're not describing good enough.  This is radio.  You want to do radio?  I can say whatever I want to about it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In graphic detail. 
[04:00:30]  Okay.  I can curse.  Okay.  Got it.  All right.  Here we go.  Describe it.  Okay.  We have two girls right now.  One girl is standing up.  One girl is sitting.  The girl on the bottom is the...  The girl on top pulled her shirt down.  The girl on the bottom is kissing one of her breasts.  All right.  Pretty good.  All right.  Here we go.  Describe and disgrace.  No.  Oh, no.  That's no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Go back.  No.  No. 
[04:01:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to...  You have to.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to eat the rest of the day.  What's wrong?  He turned away from the TV.  No.  No.  That's too much for me.  I thought you meant cup like a breast-sized cup.  I didn't know you meant like that kind of a cup.  Oh.  Oh, no.  No.  Two girls, one cup.  What a morbid video that would be.  I don't know.  That's just too much for me.  Wait a minute, David.  That's too much for me.  It's too much for me.  This is kind of an initiation for the interns.  You have to watch this.  That's not the end of the video? 
[04:01:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  No.  Now, David, we're going to be watching you.  You have to keep your eyes open and look at the screen.  If you turn away or shut your eyes, we're just going back and it's going to take longer.  We're taking the shirt back and we're kicking you off the...  Okay.  That's right.  You'll be in the doghouse.  Yep.  You'll be in Dutch.  And you want me to explain what I'm seeing?  Yes.  Yes.  And I can say whatever I want.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  We got that.  The girl sitting down is shitting into a cup.  And now they're...  Oh, no.  That's disgusting. 
[04:02:00]  I can't watch...  No, yeah.  How?  Disgusting, man.  That's disgusting.  I can't watch that.  What's happening?  What's happening, David?  The girl that...  Both the girls are eating the shit in the cup like an ice cream cone.  Yeah.  They're eating it.  Both the girls...  They're not eating it.  They're licking it.  They're licking the shit from the ice cream cone.  And now...  Now the one girl put it in her mouth and she's like playing with it in her mouth and sticking  it on her tongue and moving it around her mouth.  And it seems like she's enjoying it, which is pretty disgusting. 
[04:02:30]  And then...  Oh, my God.  She swallowed it.  Now they're licking...  Oh, no.  Now they're...  You got it.  Oh, no.  Now they're...  Oh, no.  Now she...  Now the one girl barfed.  She like...  She threw it back up.  And they're passing it between their mouths.  Oh, no.  This is too much for me.  They cursed her jersey.  Oh, no.  The one girl jammed her fingers down her mouth to spit the shit back up.  And they're...  This is too much for me.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  David, everybody. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah.  Wow, David.  People hit it.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  He sounded like Mr. Bill watching that.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Very good.  Oh, no.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, no.  There's shit all over her shirt.  How much is that going to cost to clean?  Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up, my friend.  Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama Kool-Aid. 
[04:03:30]  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we take?  Wouldn't you rather have a guy holding a gun on you?  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know. 
[04:04:00]  Because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now.  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right.  Like what?  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole?  It's time for Whitey to realize that we don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains. 
[04:04:30]  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we take?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold.  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like  human fucking beings. 
[04:05:00]  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Oh.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm going to need a nap.  You'll be happy. 
[04:05:30]  On SiriusX.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We'll be right back. 
[04:06:00]  Thank you for stopping in. It's been a few years. The new book is Uganda, Be Kidding Me. Go check that out.  I love the fact that she's a successful woman and she tells a story about accidentally shitting her pants. 
[04:06:30]  Taking a dump. Yeah, that's great.  People will do that. Absolutely.  I'm in chains.  Sam was very funny. He was listening to the song that we just played, I'm in Chains.  And said, ah, the white man finally has a voice.  Oh, boy.  I guess we go home now.  What?  What?  No, no, no. We have more radio to be done, more plugs to be done. 
[04:07:00]  Don't forget about the O.P. and Anthony podcast. Wednesday is podcast day.  And it's a podcast dedicated to the day we discovered that Scarlett Johansson had naked photos out there.  A day that changed all of us, really.  I think so.  It really was.  Go through iTunes if you can, so our numbers are that more impressive.  Yeah.  The podcast is doing very well every week.  Oh, it's very impressive.  Very well.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Some of those numbers are pretty good.  Should we check out the numbers? 
[04:07:30]  Sammy!  Come on, Sammy.  Let's take a look.  They're about the same as yesterday.  Bye.  Are you sure they're the same as yesterday?  I mean, no, they're not going to be the same, but...  Nobody even has access to them.  Nobody can do this with you.  It's like, you could have done this during a break.  Yeah.  Yeah, we like to kill a little time.  Sammy!  I heard you.  What's wrong with you?  Chelsea Handler took a liking to you.  Yeah, she did.  She might be masturbating to your picture later.  I hope so.  I don't know why she would want your picture like that.  She did, though, right? 
[04:08:00]  Yeah, she did.  She certainly did.  That's what's up.  These are the numbers?  They're very good.  Oh, oh, oh.  I see what's going on here.  Oh, you see that?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  What the hell?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Nice.  Damn, Jimmy.  That's a good number for Jim Norton Hates Animals.  It's getting there.  Yeah, I'm pretty strong.  This is not inclusive, though.  It's a problem.  What do you mean?  The listeners can't look along.  You're not revealing this. 
[04:08:30]  Well, they got their number in their head.  They're like, oh, wow, millions.  Yeah, millions.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's what makes it fun for everyone.  They got their own number in their head.  I do get a lot of feedback about how much fun people have when you're doing this.  Fun, fun.  They love when we check the numbers on our podcast, and they love when we eat.  I got a lot of great tweets from the eating segment from yesterday.  Oh, people loved it.  Yeah.  Loved it.  I was laughing at myself yesterday.  There's things that happen on this show.  I don't even know.  It's probably not even the funniest thing of the day, but it's just dumb little things 
[04:09:00]  that make me laugh the rest of the day.  And yesterday was just E-Rock discussing his German goulash.  I was thinking that for all night.  And I don't even know.  I kept saying Jarlsberg cheese last night for no reason.  And we've been doing this a long time, so I don't even know if the listeners appreciate  it in the same way.  I don't even know.  It was so fucking good.  But him just describing it, his German goulash.  A bunch of meats in a crock pot.  The heavy brown sauce.  The gravy. 
[04:09:30]  And the Jarlsberg cheese.  And the Jarlsberg cheese.  It just came up every once in a while in my head.  It just made me laugh.  Same thing.  And I know it wasn't great radio.  I know we kid around how the eating segments are good radio.  Of course they're not.  But it just made me laugh.  I couldn't stop thinking about that, too.  Even down to when we asked him, what's your special birthday meal?  What's your favorite meal?  And of course, the answer is German goulash.  German goulash. 
[04:10:00]  It wasn't.  Yeah.  What?  And just all the dynamics of the thing, because his wife knows it's his birthday.  And she already knows what his favorite meal is.  But she's asking because she's hoping he would just say something else.  Something lighter.  Because she's really all in with E-Rock losing a few pounds.  Yeah.  And of course, he just ignores that fact and goes for the German goulash.  Honey, again this year, could I have some German goulash?  All right, E-Rock.  She calls him E-Rock?  Of course. 
[04:10:30]  We've got a busy show tomorrow.  We should promote the fact that we've got Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Neil.  Neil deGrasse Tyson.  Yeah, Neil deGrasse Tyson.  Sorry.  A brilliant astrophysicist.  The new show, Cosmos.  Damn.  We've got a copy.  I can't wait to watch this tonight.  I can't either.  Carl Sagan did Cosmos.  That was his show.  He's done billions and billions of stars.  And Neil deGrasse Tyson is doing it now.  I think Seth MacFarlane is the exec producer.  Whatever.  He's involved with it.  Really?  So I'm sure he'll be great. 
[04:11:00]  That reminds me of the time we went to Pluto.  Oh, did you?  And then a real-time trip to Pluto.  Right.  That's amazing.  We should do a science quiz between Voss and Neil deGrasse Tyson.  Oh, that would be great.  With Anthony obsessing about this, can't we get one of our guys to put a little montage of all the...  That reminds me of the time.  All right.  Fifty times.  Yeah, but it's that old thing with comedy. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, that it gets annoying and then it gets funny again?  Yes.  Well, you know what?  Yes.  It ceases to ever get funny again.  We've done that a few times on the show.  Oh, God.  Once in a while.  It's funny, then it gets annoying, and then it comes back, and it's funny again.  It's every joke, though.  God, jeez.  Some guy's been on hold for two hours.  What?  What did he want?  His name's not Bobo, is it?  Let's say hi to Dave in Illinois.  Dave, you've been on hold for two hours. 
[04:12:00]  Maybe he's asleep.  Remember that?  Occasionally, we'd pop up the phone and the guy was asleep.  Dave?  I hear him snoring.  Oh, Dave.  Dave, wake up.  Dave.  Is he listening to us?  I hope he's dead.  Dave, wake up.  Let's say hi to Dave in Illinois.  Yeah.  You've been on hold for two hours.  Oh, now we get the echo back.  We're talking right now to his brains on the wall and a fucking smoldering pillow with a bullet.  And we were supposed to save only hope. 
[04:12:30]  Right.  Only hope.  It took us two hours to get to him.  Yeah.  Dave.  Dave.  Dave.  Yo.  Oh, yo.  Hi, Dave.  You've been waiting for two hours.  I didn't know I was still on, dude.  I hung up like an hour and a half ago.  Wait, this is a surprise to you as well, that you're still connected to the show?  Yeah, I was listening to you guys and you're calling me and I'm like, fuck, I better pick  up the phone.  We're not calling you. 
[04:13:00]  How did we call you?  Oh, that's odd.  Yeah.  We're not doing that new in.  Oh, you're crapping out, Dave.  Yeah.  And you really are.  All right.  That's.  Mancow's got a TV show here in Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone has a TV show but us.  Fucking.  I know.  Rover has one.  Mancow has one.  Fucking Stern had his thing.  Cavino and Rich.  I know.  Everyone.  Everyone but us. 
[04:13:30]  Orange is stinks.  Let's call them up.  We should have a TV show.  Fucking ridiculous.  Let's call them up.  We should have a show.  I was working in a bar in Joliet called Pauly's Pub.  Who does?  Turd?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're trying to find Turd.  Tell Turd.  Someone's got to run into that joint.  Tell Turd that we want to talk to him on our show.  Turd.  All right.  I'll do that.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Get a hold of Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Let's say hi to Bob Levy. 
[04:14:00]  Bob.  What's he doing?  Hey, man.  I heard the bad news.  You guys are on the way out, man.  I was just going to say, yeah, if you guys need a place to stay, I got three extra rooms.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it, Bob.  It's fucking horrible, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if I said that I was at the Joke Factory in Rochester this week, that means nobody would  come because nobody listens to you guys, right?  That's true.  And it also proves that you're on the way out.  What are you doing in Rochester in the middle of winter?  I like it. 
[04:14:30]  It's pretty fucking brutal.  Which place is that?  Are you allowed to go on Brother Weezer's show?  Because he'll get some fannies in the seats for you.  But I'm not sure if that's the club he's associated with.  I think he does the other club.  That's what the problem is.  Oh, man.  And we know the other guy really well.  I know.  That's what I was saying.  I was like telling the guy that I want to go.  You know, I hope he's friends with the guy up there.  And I think that there might be a problem.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Maybe we'll figure it out down the road.  Hey, look.  Steve Blatter.  Hey, Steve. 
[04:15:00]  Remember him?  He said hi to me in the bathroom today.  Oh.  Hi or a little tug?  A little tug.  A little fucking tap?  A little tug.  Did he tap a little urine off of a...  A little bit.  A little bit.  Nice.  Like you're trying to get a little ash off your cigar.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Where's the gig, Bob?  Uh, it's called the Joke Factory.  It's in Rochester.  Make jokes, though.  New York.  I'll be there.  Five eight eight eight.  Big assembly line.  Three shows.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  And good luck in the future, whatever you guys are doing.  Okay? 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, I appreciate it.  How far into the future?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Like 10,000 years, generally speaking, for humanity, or just us like tomorrow?  Oh, good question.  I don't know.  I can never tell, Bob.  All right.  Oh, man.  He's, uh, he's a pisser on Twitter.  I'm going to be honest.  There are some times I get a really good chuckle out of, uh, Bob leaving.  Racist stuff?  No, no.  It doesn't have to be.  I can appreciate all brands of humor, uh, racist or not. 
[04:16:00]  Okay.  For all my racist humor, I do have a particular website I visit.  I'm not accusing.  That's hilarious.  I ask the questions.  I'm not accusing.  N-words in the news is fun.  Uh, N-word videos is very fun on that site.  Um, there's a lot of, uh, fights at Chuck E. Cheese and, uh, Denny's.  Why Chuck E. Cheese?  I don't know.  Apparently, some people really enjoy a good knock-down, drag-out brawl at, uh, Chuck E. Cheese's. 
[04:16:30]  And, uh, in order to boost up the, uh, difficulty level, they hold one baby in one arm as they're throwing punches with the other arm.  It's fascinating viewing.  You know, babies pick up on that stuff.  You think?  It's not good.  Maybe.  Babies and kids, uh, will repeat everything you do.  Oh, you're telling me.  Oh, no.  Uncle Paul.  Jesus.  You ever hear a baby start going, kiss the magic eel, and you're going, shut up in there! 
[04:17:00]  Boy, oh boy, what a snitcher!  You're repeating things like a little parrot, right?  Yeah!  That's why you gotta give them the ultimatum.  Don't you give them an ultimatum about, you know, what'll happen, uh, if they talk?  I try to mate them, sure.  Ultimatum.  You gotta say things that won't get you in trouble.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, uh, what?  Like, while you're doing it, you go, no molestation going on in this area. 
[04:17:30]  So then the parents come home and the baby goes, meh, no molestation going on in this area, meh.  And they don't wonder why he's saying that?  I wouldn't know.  Okay.  Mr. Hargis, I say, hey, my phone's no good.  This is a recording.  Recording.  That's, uh, that's fantastic.  It is fantastic.  Sure it is.  Sure.  Oh, boy.  Everybody feels good. 
[04:18:00]  Yeah.  A couple other things.  You got another kid being suspended because he pointed his finger like a gun.  That's, uh...  These stories are just almost not even worth discussing anymore.  Zero tolerance.  It's zero tolerance.  Ten-year-old boy suspended from school for three days for pointing his finger like a gun.  There was a high school kid that got suspended, um, for telling his teacher that he inadvertently  brought a beer to school.  He went to grab a soda out of the...  A road soda?  A road soda.  Out of the fridge.  Nice.  And he grabbed a beer accidentally and just threw it in his backpack. 
[04:18:30]  When he got to school, he realized, oh, shit, I have a beer.  Uh, and he told the teacher, look, I inadvertently brought this.  It was all sealed still.  And, uh, because of the zero tolerance policy, he was suspended.  But without, like, he was just trying to kind of be honest about it.  Right.  You can't have zero tolerance.  It should be a case-by-case basis.  Because there are going to be exceptions.  Yeah, that, you know...  The fifth grader said he was just playing around.  But district spokesman Jeff Warner told the Columbus Dispatch that the principal, Patricia Price, 
[04:19:00]  has warned students about pretend gunplay numerous times this year, and everyone should  know the rules by now.  He said warnings have been included in three newsletters sent home with kids.  We used to bring toy guns to school.  We bring in toy guns that look like real guns.  And, you know, fuck around.  When we talk about this, the guys, the older guys will call up now and say, no, we used 
[04:19:30]  to bring real guns to school.  Oh, well, real guns, because they used to have, like, a target shooting in some high schools  down in the basement of the school.  They'd have a rifle range.  And you'd bring in a, you know, your rifle and plink a few rounds off.  Now you can't make a fucking finger gun.  And the boys said he was just playing around.  The father said no one was threatened.  And the boy has never been in trouble before.  So it's just...  Was he doing the end of Taxi Driver thing, where he goes...  That could be a little creepy. 
[04:20:00]  Yeah, they're getting a little crazy with...  I don't think that has any impact on any future gun incidents.  If you keep a kid from making a finger gun or chewing a Pop-Tart into the shape of a gun,  I don't think that has any bearing.  What are you talking about a Pop-Tart?  A kid, like, chewed...  That happened, too?  Yeah.  He chewed like a Pop-Tart into the shape of a gun in the cafeteria and held it up. 
[04:20:30]  And boom, you're fucking out of here.  You're suspended.  Well, he should have known.  He should have known.  All right, well...  And he should have known.  It's almost a waste of time bringing these stories up, because we know it's happening.  Yeah.  It's just ridiculous.  It's cray, cray.  The John Travolta thing.  I don't know this.  Is it an actual video clip?  No.  It's not a long quote.  Where is it?  At all.  Where is it?  Oh, shit.  I shot Favre in the mace.  Save because he mixes the letters up or something. 
[04:21:00]  Yeah.  Ida...  Ida Dem...  Dazeem?  Well, he fucked it up, because now no one knows what a real name is.  Adele Nazeem.  Adele Nazeem.  Allahu Akbar.  Shot Favre in the mace.  But her name's Idina Menzel.  Idina.  Idina.  That was close.  Idina Menzel.  Adele Nazeem.  Right.  Oh, he had confidence, though.  Oh, he certainly did.  What happened there, you think?  He just couldn't see the... 
[04:21:30]  I think some thetans got to him.  Yeah.  Zeno was speaking through him.  And then apparently...  I saw...  I don't know if it's fake or not, but she's in this play, If Then.  Right.  Yeah.  And they put out little pamphlets in the playbill that said,  Tonight, uh...  Oh, in the...  Idina Menzel's role will be played by Adele Nazeem.  Adele Nazeem.  Like, what a fucking pompous dickhead he is to not...  Not get that or try to get that right.  It was a moment.  Yeah, you know that that's what you're gonna do, right?  You finally have this moment where your name's gonna be set in front of a billion people. 
[04:22:00]  And the asshole that's...  Fucks it up.  Don't worry about where his next massage is gonna come from.  Fucks up your name.  Hey, chafed anus, could you get the fucking name right?  Holy fuck.  That was her big moment.  Hugs and kisses on the stairs to the plane.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that really is a downer for her.  Although many more people are talking about her now because of that.  Yeah, that's true.  It probably worked out in her favor in the end. 
[04:22:30]  You're right.  Damn.  Because there's a lot of articles and stories on it.  It's like the Taylor Swift thing.  Yeah.  And then the Jimmy Fallon thing.  Kanye made her famous.  The Jimmy Fallon thing with her and the kids' toys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That bit was just...  I saw the bit last night.  I told these guys before the show, Jimmy Fallon is...  I love the guy.  He's on far.  There's nothing mean spirit about him.  It's just a nice show, but the jokes are there.  All age groups can like him.  Both men and women.  He's perfect for it.  And he gets the whole band together with the kids' instruments. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah.  And that's just...  How nice is that?  Everyone's just happy.  How sweet is that?  Just a happy little, you know, bit he does.  I would love it.  And he did it with the Frozen Broad that sings Let It Go.  If like two, three in the morning, every night, he was just going out creeping and beating  hookers up and shit.  I would love if that story came out.  Jimmy Fallon, like, is a creep.  And he just goes on, hey, how you doing?  I wonder what his thing is.  What's his thing?  Everyone's got a thing.  I think everyone has a thing. 
[04:23:30]  What is his thing?  What's Fallon's thing that people would hate?  I'm not saying.  I know what it is, too.  Oh, do you?  Come on, Jimmy.  Let us all know.  Come on.  He adopts small animals.  Yeah.  And then he swings them around until they're dead.  What?  Just swings them.  Doesn't hit them on anything?  No, he doesn't hit them on anything.  He just swings them around until they're dead.  And he has a notebook with the time it took for each one.  That's terrible.  And big laughs, like written out, LOL.  LOL.  Yeah.  Like a dachshund puppy.  Yeah. 
[04:24:00]  15 minutes, LOL.  Yeah.  Nice.  He has big parties.  All his Hollywood friends come.  They bring a small animal for Jimmy to swing until he's dead.  That's terrible.  So what happened with the John Travolta thing that's so awesome?  He explained himself?  Or he apologized?  Or what?  He had something to say about it?  His statement was, I've been beating myself up all day.  Oh.  Then I thought, what would Idina Menzel say?  Who?  I mean Adele Dazeem.  Adele Dazeem. 
[04:24:30]  She'd say, let it go, let it go.  Oh.  Boo!  Let it go.  That's her song.  That's the lyrics to her song.  Reminds me of another song, though.  Like, what do you think Idina should say?  What she should...  Get over it!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Get over it!  Pitching a fit!  Come on, do it!  I'm just running, crying, pitching a fit!  Yeah!  You don't like that line? 
[04:25:00]  It's a great line.  Pitching a fit, putting it where I take a shit to get over it.  Who pitches a fit?  I don't know.  So...  Adele Dazeem needs to stop pitching a fit.  Adele Dazeem.  So John Travolta's just gonna let it go and not beat himself up over it.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Because what would Idina Menzel say?  She'd say, let it go, let...  It's just the lyrics to her song, dude.  Yeah.  Right.  She wouldn't...  She's not letting it go.  She's extremely bummed.  No explanation of what happened to him, though.  Why he said that. 
[04:25:30]  Not even an apology.  No.  No, no.  She'd say, I can't believe that cocksucker fucked up my name.  Yeah.  Waddle Doodle.  Yeah, that dumb fucking thing on his head.  I'm bored with it.  I don't even see how he got Adele Dazeem from there.  Well, let's start with Adele.  He got Adele from Idina.  Yeah.  Okay.  Adele from it.  So that's Adele, and then Menzel is Dazeem.  It's not even close.  It's not even close.  It's like even no motherfucking ballpark. 
[04:26:00]  It's like he took all the letters...  And just threw them on a board and said, okay, what does that say?  Yeah, it's the jumble.  Right.  What a guy.  Adele Dazeem.  Adele Dazeem.  Hey, let it go.  The Incomparable.  Amazing.  That's Travolta.  Let it go, though.  He's a fun one to watch.  He just turned into a weirdo.  He's strange.  Of all the Travolta wig jokes, and Travolta looks like an action figure jokes that were 
[04:26:30]  coming through on Twitter, he did the only thing possible to distract from his hair.  You know, that's a good point.  Maybe he did that on purpose so no one would talk about his wig.  Like, what if I make up a nonsense name for this performer?  Patrice used to just talk about how his big comeback, and it was one fucking movie,  Pulp Fiction, and that's it.  Right.  That was it.  Well, what else did he do?  Everything else was shite.  He made that Scientology movie that was awful. 
[04:27:00]  Oh, Battlefield Earth.  Battlefield Earth.  What else has he done?  There's got to be one more in there.  He had Face Off.  He had fucking the other one.  The Angel movie.  Michael.  Yeah, fuck it.  I almost like that movie.  Michael?  I think it is, if it's the one I'm thinking about.  Look, I'm an angel.  Oh, no, no.  I'm thinking of something else.  Get Shorty wasn't bad.  Get Shorty was an ensemble cast.  True.  And then Broken Arrow.  And Face Off did very well at the box office.  I will still watch Face Off.  It's ridiculous.  Phenomenon is the one I like. 
[04:27:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Phenomenon.  I kind of like Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  That was eight.  Yeah?  They thought he had special powers or something.  It turned out he had some.  Oh, that was different.  Oh, he had a brain tumor or something.  Yeah, he could just make a scandal disappear.  Yeah.  His brain tumor from the wig glue.  It'll happen.  You know Pulp Fiction is 20 years old?  Yeah.  That movie came out when we started doing radio together.  Crazy.  Isn't that nuts?  It still holds up.  It's such a good fucking movie.  Jim liked the taking of Palom 1, 2, 3. 
[04:28:00]  Oh, the remake with John Travolta.  What a chilling villain he was.  Right.  It's so much better than the original.  Yeah, I didn't like Robert Shaw.  He was so evil.  Robert Shaw's a hack.  Evil?  Evil.  The bald head and the crazy dialogue.  Do we have any of that, Sam?  You bet.  This was good stuff.  Value my life a lot more than $3,000, chief.  Oh, this?  Yeah.  I want to see Travolta's wacky.  Whoa.  Ah!  Beavis. 
[04:28:30]  Okay, I'm going to need the R train to switch over to this.  That's Denzel.  Back to 34th Street.  Just a typical day in the big city.  Oh, with the directing that was.  Yeah, who directed this?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  With his neck tattoo.  His edge hat.  Wouldn't you know that?  Sunglasses.  Yes.  Wouldn't you know that guy was up to something?  The problem.  He's dressed like a crook.  Everybody else!  This side's facing the window.  Oh, boy.  Pella, one, two, three.  Control center, call him Pelham, one, two, three. 
[04:29:00]  I'd draw on that bitch.  Right there on the fucking subway.  You'd do it?  I'd draw on him.  Oh, yeah.  Solve that problem.  Look at he's split.  Shoot him in his neck tattoo.  Fuck, yeah.  You're missing a great dialogue.  You're missing a great dialogue.  Sorry.  What the hell?  Talking during the movie.  What do you think?  It's radio.  I'm not a hostage negotiator.  I'm a civil service employee.  Oh, I think you'll do just fine.  Whoa.  What time do you got on your watch?  2.13.  59 minutes, I'm going to start killing passengers.  You don't want innocent people dying, do you? 
[04:29:30]  You tell me.  We support the Kevin Spacey in this movie.  You just have to do what I say.  Call the mayor now.  Somebody just hijacked Pelham, one, two, three.  Aw.  James Gandolfini was in this.  He's the mayor.  I'm just a guy.  I'm just a guy on the other end of the mic.  All right.  You get it.  You're a regular guy.  He's the best friend I ever make.  Ah.  This summer.  How are you going to get the money here?  They're setting down every intersection from here to Brooklyn.  The money's on the way.  Oh, is this bad?  Stinks. 
[04:30:00]  There was an accident.  Now somebody else has to die.  Those cops are going to be down that tunnel.  Get an easy shot.  Does he kill anybody in this movie?  Of course he does.  Oh, he does?  I want to make a deal.  I will trade you for all of these passengers.  He killed himself.  Did he?  Yeah, Ridley Scott's brother.  No wonder.  No wonder, right?  This might have been the turning point.  The fucking straw that broke the camel's back, as they call it.  Well, imagine if you're Ridley Scott's brother, and then you make the Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 remake.  You fucking watch Gladiator, and you're like, fuck, my brother did that, and I'm making this fucking piece of shit. 
[04:30:30]  Like, I'm the one who chose the handlebar mustache for Revolta.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Don't you think Tony Scott should have...  When he had a problem, what he should have done is...  He should have, uh...  Oh, there it is.  Pitching a fit again, guys?  Was he pitching a fit?  I don't know.  It's funny here.  Yep.  Apparently he was pitching a fit.  He shouldn't have pitched a fit.  Nah, don't pitch a fit.  Apparently he pitched himself off a bridge. 
[04:31:00]  That's right.  See, that's what he did.  He killed himself off a bridge.  Oh, boy.  I got one.  Yeah?  Instead of pitching a fit, you should pitch tenths.  All right.  What a fun day we had today, everybody.  It's pretty much...  You didn't like that one?  No.  Chelsea Handle working the heart.  Running to pitch in a chip.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[04:31:30]  That's the way to do it.  You like that one, Chip?  Oh, yeah.  Where are you seeing Chelsea looking attractive?  Eric just sent me a picture so I could tweet it.  Oh, is she gone?  But she kept her coat on the whole time.  Yes.  Yeah, what was that about?  I was going to ask her to take it off, but I was like, I don't want to be crazy, guys.  Take it off.  Take your coat off.  God damn, take it off.  Take it off.  Yeah, why did you do that?  Take it off.  Take it off now.  Take it off.  Take it off.  Take it off now.  Take it off.  Yeah.  Please take off your coat, please.  What happened?  Oh, my God. 
[04:32:00]  Will you please take off your coat?  Yeah, she was all bundled up.  Well, what the fuck?  I want to see them fucking tits.  What happened?  She was very nice.  She was nice, but she's got fucking tits.  Jesus, man.  That's vulgar.  She probably want to see.  Oh, sorry, Chip.  Just a little humor, Chip.  Humor.  You don't call him that.  What do you call him?  Flim Flons.  What?  Because he probably could say him and my mother wouldn't know what he was saying.  It's fucking Denny right there. 
[04:32:30]  Denny Falcone.  Tell him to keep walking.  Denny!  Hey!  Look at him.  You want an update from Denny?  That walk is hilarious.  It's busted leg walk.  Fucking Doberman Pinscher head.  He looks like a...  Doberman Pinscher head.  I was going to go, he looks like a turtle without its shell.  He really does.  He's the one guy left in radio that's loyal to you guys during your decline.  That's true.  On the way down.  What's Chelsea Handler's Twitter?  Chelsea Handler.  Chelsea Handler.  All right.  Okay.  Then this Falcone with his fucking misery hobbled legs. 
[04:33:00]  Oh, exactly.  Oh, with that walk.  The fucking car just clipped both of his fucking dumb boyish legs in the ice.  Fucking smashed both of his...  What was the guy?  Drunk driving.  Jumped a curb.  Yeah.  Hit Denny.  Pinned him between, what, a wall and a bumper or some shit?  And the only thing that kept him from dying was he could hear the radio coming from the  other room.  Yes, of course.  It saved his life.  Have you said that or something?  No, I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  Of course it probably is.  Fucking Frankie Avalon hairdo.  A Doberman Pinscher with a Frankie Avalon hairdo. 
[04:33:30]  That's what he is.  Oh, fucking mayor of Goose Egg City.  Saying he's a zilch.  He played the zero.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Don't forget our podcast today.  Go to iTunes.

[04:39:00]  Welcome to the Post Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number.  866-969-1969 to be a part of this.  See you later.  Chelsea Handler.  Great guest today.  Lots of good stuff going down today.  Some radio wars happened.  Some Jason Ellis discussion.  Some Ron and Fez discussion.  Not a lot of Scott and Todd discussion today, though, Eric. 
[04:39:30]  Disappointment for you?  No, it's time to rest out a little bit.  But maybe tomorrow.  Maybe tomorrow.  Yeah.  Don't rest it too much.  Sal, everything that happened today happened for a reason.  Some of it was funny.  Let's find out what the funniest was.  And listen to Line of the Day.  Here comes Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day. 
[04:40:00]  I want some, I don't know, Thai food.  Where do I go?  No, like, hey, how are you this morning?  Thai food within three miles.  Thank you.  Oh, I'm in love.  No.  Oh, I love you.  That's what's happening?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or it messes up what you say.  I want, I want you to duck my cock.  No, wrong.  No.  Stupid.  No.  I felt like the guys might have missed the point of the movie Her at that time.  A little bit, yeah.  Did you see it, Sal?  I did not.  I just, I saw the trail and I was like, this is the fucking dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[04:40:30]  Well, it won an Academy Award for screenwriting.  It looks awful.  So how did you feel about it then?  I couldn't care any less now.  Spike Jonze won an award for it, Sal.  Not a big fan of Spike Jonze either.  Why?  Because he's a little too old?  Spike Jonze was hipster before there was such a thing as hipsters.  I don't know.  Who's your favorite film director?  You did that pretty interesting thing.  Wes Anderson probably?  No, I'm not a big Wes Anderson fan at all, actually.  Who's your favorite film director?  I like Tarantino.  Tarantino.  Way to go original with that one. 
[04:41:00]  Way to really take a risk.  Whatever.  Let's go to some phone calls.  Eric in Atlanta.  What's going on, fellas?  How you doing, Sam?  How you doing?  Hey, good.  So yesterday, I turned on Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  And they're talking about some K-corn stuff.  People kept calling in.  So I called, and I honestly didn't know what it was.  I asked Fez, you know, what's the K-corn thing?  No, you didn't.  And he let me have it, told me to call you, like, just ripped you apart. 
[04:41:30]  So I guess I'm still kind of sort of trying to get to the bottom of it.  And apparently I had a nerve with the whole K-corn thing.  Yeah.  What good?  Do we have the original clip that we played on the show yesterday of the K-corn?  Yeah, I don't know if we have the track listing, though, with it.  I think it's the first clip from yesterday.  It's in the miscellaneous folder in the left there.  But yeah, Eric from Atlanta was the first caller of the clip we featured.  Huh.  Well, as we look for that clip, DJ Who Kid is in the building.  What's up, Who Kid? 
[04:42:00]  What up, my N-word?  I have bad news.  Uh-oh, what happened?  You quitting?  No.  Okay.  No.  That would be great news.  I got into, I'm in another war with Fez.  Aw, come on, man.  I don't mean to do these things.  Stop it, man.  Why are you always messing with my boy?  I'm not messing with him.  Leave him alone.  But what happened was yesterday, or two days ago, he went on the air.  And instead of, he was mad at people because they told him they didn't want him to go  in a certain area of the building, because I guess they didn't want him talking to guests 
[04:42:30]  or whatever.  Are you serious?  I guess so.  And he said that the people talking about him should shut their cake horns.  Whatever that means.  Well, yeah, cake horn doesn't mean anything.  There's cake hole, but cake horn doesn't mean anything.  And then, displaying the power that the Ron and Fez show has, hashtag cake horn, became  the number one trending topic in the United States of America.  I'm hashtagging that right now as we speak.  And so, I told Obi and Anthony about it and brought some clips to the show. 
[04:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then Fez got very upset.  For that caller, Eric in Atlanta, here's the cake horn clip.  Go ahead.  Eric in Atlanta, you're on the run of Fez show.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, a little late to the show here.  What's this cake horn thing?  Yeah, act like you don't fucking know.  I'll tell you what.  Here's what you fucking do.  Go ask Sam Roberts what cake horn is.  All right.  All right.  Just call his clip show tomorrow and ask what cake horn's all about. 
[04:43:30]  Today, he's taking, of course, like the little pat rack that he is, he's taking, he finds  a piece of tape, people busted my balls about saying cake horn, goes running with it to  O&A.  So, obviously, then Eric did indeed call up this clip show to find out what a cake horn  was.  And no, the answer is what you would assume it is.  It's nothing.  But that's the story with cake horn.  Cake horn.  Cake horn.  All right.  We have a cake here.  Right. 
[04:44:00]  And then, was it a car horn, a bull horn?  Some kind of horn.  Maybe like a trumpet.  A trumpet is a horn.  Yeah, it's a trumpet.  Throw a trumpet on top of a cake.  I'm not quite sure.  That's some weird shit.  Yeah, I don't know.  But maybe you could get it trending in hip hop.  I don't know.  Maybe the sound.  Wah.  Right.  Wah.  Something like that.  Roland got us a cake horn yesterday.  Did he?  Thank you very much, Roland.  There's a photo up on the Instagram.  Did he eat it?  Yes, he did.  How did it taste, Roland?  Pretty good. 
[04:44:30]  A little salty?  It's delicious.  All right.  This guy had a dick yesterday.  I got that.  I got from what you were...  A cake horn sounds like...  Well, it might be a dick.  It could be.  We don't know for sure.  Pussy and suck at some cock.  That's what you do?  That's what a man does.  Mine should do look like a horn, though.  Why?  Does it curve?  Yeah.  That's not normal.  It's only for Asian women.  Do Asian women have curved vaginas?  Yeah.  I had no idea.  It's sideways.  Oh, so you can slip it in with the curve and you don't even have to hook it.  That's why my dick is like a horn.  Congratulations. 
[04:45:00]  And that's why your kids are Blasian.  Fez is a genius.  He knows about my dick.  Sal, let's play E-Rock's favorite clip of today.  I just love to be okay.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  What'd you say?  I was laughing at everyone else.  Cake horn.  Cake horn.  Cake horn.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not doing it.  It's not a cake thing.  Cake horn.  Yo, you got to stop it with this Fez thing, man.  You got to be young.  He's going to fuck you up. 
[04:45:30]  First of all, that was E-Rock's clip of the day.  And second of all, E-Rock, explain to Who Kid why you picked that clip.  Because it's making fun of Fez making fun of their intern, this kid named Vito.  And Vito got all defensive.  And when he was trying to defend himself, his voice got really high.  And ONA just exaggerated.  And it made it sound a lot funnier.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  There's going to be some serious fighting up here.  I hope not.  I love Fez.  Ooh, Fight Club.  If he would punch you, where would he hit you first, Fez?  Where would he hit me?  I don't know. 
[04:46:00]  He'd probably swing and then hit me in the titty or something.  You know what I mean?  This guy's a titty.  Flat-fisted right into the titty.  I think so.  I think so.  I think he hit me a good slap.  You think so?  I mean, that's possible.  Bill in Boston.  Oh, thank God.  I love you guys.  I just moved over from Howard Stern.  I just fucking can't stand him anymore.  I love Owen now.  Okay, great.  Oh, shit.  But I have to ask a question.  I'm really curious.  Is Fez retarded?  No, I don't think Fez is retarded.  I mean, if you had the question, I'm glad you sought clarification on it. 
[04:46:30]  But no.  To my knowledge, Fez is not mentally retarded.  You know, he gets angry at times.  But that doesn't make him retarded.  Does Roland have a clip of the day today?  What do you think, Sam?  You do?  I'm going to do it verbally, though.  No, Roland.  That's not how it works.  All you have to do is go up to Eric and say,  I like this part of the show.  I want to do a verbatim of the thing.  It doesn't matter.  ONA show covers with Roland.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense, Sam.  Shut up.  All you have to do is say, 
[04:47:00]  Eric, that's my clip.  That's it.  You don't have to touch any computers.  You don't have to do anything.  I want to reenact it.  Go ahead.  It's nice.  We're the Cheerios.  What?  What is that?  I'll be eating your breakfast.  Did he even do that on the air?  No, but see?  It was like a little nugget.  What's a nugget?  I've been hanging out with Bob Kelly too long.  By the way, Rich Ross and Bob Kelly  on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  That's very exciting.  Roland.  I'll get one tomorrow.  Roland, all you have to do, 
[04:47:30]  I'm not asking you to do anything.  All you have to do is go up to Eric and say,  that clip.  And Eric, you will do all the work, correct?  I did at the beginning when he would say,  oh, I want that.  Remember, he would just pick clips out of context  that had no meaning?  Yeah.  At least he was doing something.  Something.  But don't pick clips out of context.  Just listen to the show.  It's your guests on it.  Listen to how the interviews go.  Pick something from the interview.  And then add some insight.  I'm with the publicist. 
[04:48:00]  Don't you care how the interview goes, though?  Don't the publicists hear the interviews?  Yeah, some.  Then you talk and...  Okay, okay, okay.  The publicists are hearing the interviews.  Sometimes.  Yeah, because they talk to you, too.  Okay.  But if the publicist can hear the interviews,  and you're with the publicist,  you can hear the interviews.  But not all the time.  Not like today, any kind of interview.  The public...  You...  He's looking...  He's looking the shit out of you right now.  All you have to do  is pick a clip from your interview 
[04:48:30]  that you booked,  and then add some insight.  Like, oh, you know,  when I booked this person,  I didn't know if this was going to go this way,  but it turned out to go that way.  And then we talk for two minutes.  I just need two minutes and a clip.  Do you want to do it for me?  You know what to do.  I can't do it all, Roland.  Yeah, you can do it.  Thanks for the pep talk.  That's what I needed.  Sal, what's your clip of the day?  I think that's guy.  Sam Roberts.  Hey, Sam.  The wonderful Sam Roberts.  Look, he's got a big pubic mound on his head. 
[04:49:00]  Why did you pick that clip, Sal?  Because it was fucking funny.  That's good enough.  That's all I need.  I've always brought it up, man.  You know who that voice was?  You're the first black guy on Opie and Anthony, man.  You know who that voice was  describing my beautiful hair?  Chelsea.  That's right.  Chelsea Handler.  That's that bitch.  They didn't get into the 50 Cent thing with her,  though, did they?  Ah, shit.  No.  I said on the air today that you said,  I said I heard Chelsea fucked 50 Cent from DJ Hookin.  When did I say that?  Is that that?  Yes.  Is that true? 
[04:49:30]  You know, when is the show over?  We still got two minutes?  Let's go to Brady in Louisiana.  Shit, nigga.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Well, first off, ever since,  I'm glad I became a regular listener again,  and you've improved so much.  You're actually enjoyable to listen to now.  All right, again.  I mean, nobody can just have a compliment.  It's always got to be a little,  like, you used to be horrible,  but now you're...  Now you the shit.  Right.  All right.  And, well, what happened to Jason Ellis?  Because last time I was listening,  y'all were simulcasting a show on the weekends. 
[04:50:00]  Well, I mean, it got great.  Jason Ellis decided...  Do we have any Jason...  Anybody pick a Jason Ellis clip?  No.  Okay.  I need your reenactments.  Nobody wants your reenactments, dude.  I don't care about that shit, nigga.  Exactly.  Thank you for saying what was on all of our minds.  Jason Ellis went and took a shot at the show  while he was doing interviews.  It was with another radio show.  Oh.  And so we played the clip today,  and it was like...  It's crazy to me that Jason Ellis would take shots at O&A  because, like, he gets a lot of hate, Jason Ellis. 
[04:50:30]  And that's fine.  It is what it is.  I get hate.  Who kid?  You get hate.  People get hate.  But when you get that much hate from people,  you'd think that you'd be aware of the people who support you  and just be like, let me make sure I'm loyal to those guys.  You want to talk about giving somebody the benefit of a doubt  when all the O&A fans hated Jason Ellis,  when it was kind of clear that Anthony wasn't a big fan.  When Jim...  I mean, Jim was never not a big fan,  but he was like, whatever.  Opie was constantly in this guy's corner. 
[04:51:00]  He put him on the channel.  Jason Ellis comes up to New York and does his show.  Opie goes on the show  and sacrifices our own young lamb,  Eric Nagel, E-Rock.  Oh, for real.  And you had to do stunts on the guy's show.  Yeah.  That was fun.  He knocked him down.  He did.  Do you feel like you were used at this point?  How do you feel coming off of this thing?  I felt used while we were doing it,  but I knew it would make good radio.  That's why I did it.  But you made good radio for...  A guy who doesn't like us. 
[04:51:30]  How do you feel?  Well, it sucks now.  Yeah.  Why give him good shit?  Now you know how Scott Shannon feels.  He was a bloody goat, huh?  A goddamn Nagel kid.  No.  He likes me.  What was Travis's clip?  Exactly behind his back.  Not behind his back.  He knew how I felt.  He heard about it.  I fucking said it on Twitter.  I said,  but I was being courteous to a guest on our show.  You stupid shit fuck.  Shut up.  Beat your mother's asshole,  you fucking douche cunt.  Shut up. 
[04:52:00]  Shut it.  Oh, now I'm racist.  Now I'm racist.  Shut up,  you liberal piece of dog shit.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You 15-yard lover.  Boy.  Jimmy can explain this to you.  It is clever.  Jimmy, explain.  Everybody was angry today, huh?  Oh my God.  Anthony was on fire today.  Out of the gate,  Anthony was on fire.  I mean,  holy shit was he upset.  But he came on, 
[04:52:30]  he's honest.  And he was finally able,  but that's what really,  I would imagine,  had to drive Opie crazy.  That it seems like this is a guy  he's been kind of loyal to  that's now egoed up,  I guess.  You see,  nature balances itself out.  Because we lost Scott Shannon,  now we've gained Jason Ellis.  I guess so.  But why do we have to fight  with the people who do shows  in the company?  Right.  Like,  how come we have to make friends  with people in terrestrial radio?  I don't like that.  I don't like it at all.  You look very angry too today, Sam.  I'm passionate, 
[04:53:00]  who kid?  We're friends with the mashup.  I mean,  kind of,  but we take shots at them constantly.  That is true.  Like,  constantly.  I mean,  you love those guys,  but you make fun of their show.  All the time.  It's very confusing to me.  Right.  And who kid,  you gotta catch the whole replay  of the show today.  You hear,  Anthony,  that was Anthony's mood  from top to bottom.  No.  Oh yeah,  he's going after everybody.  All day?  Yep.  Oh,  I gotta check it out.  All day.  You're on the West Coast.  You missed it today.  You gotta,  check out the,  the replay starts right after this show.  The West Coast Encore.  I'm mad I miss Fez getting angry. 
[04:53:30]  Yeah,  that was,  and I'm sure Ron and Fez is on at noon  on Raw Dog,  so if you want to go over there.  How are you going to fix this Fez thing?  You fix it every time.  It's not my job to fix anything.  He's going to smack you.  He's going to snuff you.  Well,  I don't want him to snuff me.  If he's going to snuff me,  then I'll fix it.  I don't want to.  He has a lot of glucose in him,  man.  I don't know,  man.  You feel like he does?  What does glucose do to you?  Because you can't make people  with sweetness angry  because they don't know  how to balance it out.  If they're angry,  you know,  they kill people.  I don't want to be dead. 
[04:54:00]  Glucose.  Is that what snuff means?  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey,  who kid?  What's up?  What up,  my nigga?  Hey.  What's the problem  with Roland  picking clips of the day?  Does D-Rock have trouble  understanding Roland  when he talks?  Well,  that's the biggest problem  with Roland reenacting clips.  Nobody knows what he's talking about  because nobody can understand  a word he says.  What was that he said anyway?  What was that?  Can you say it again,  Roland?  What was the reenactment?  I said,  cheerio,  please.  What the fuck is he talking about? 
[04:54:30]  I don't know what the fuck  he's talking about.  Joe in Louisville.  I got some weight loss  advice from a guy  who said he lost  150 pounds.  He said he could eat  whatever he wants,  but the key is  only eat half the food  on your plate.  So once you have,  once you're done  with half the food  on your plate,  you gotta cut off  your cake horn.  Roland.  He said you can lose  some weight  if you cut your cake horn off  after you only eat  half the food  on your plate.  Yeah,  he can set fire your wife  if he put your dick in her. 
[04:55:00]  Did you say set fire?  Satisfy.  Satisfy.  Oh,  so you're saying  he doesn't have sex  with his wife.  Correct.  And that's his problem  to deal with.  Yeah,  the pool boy.  Okay,  I mean,  it seemed like  he was trying to help you.  I'm helping him too.  Alright.  Piece of shit.  I can help everybody.  Cake horn.  Can you replace moisture  in your hashtags with that?  Oh yeah,  I'm gonna have to,  man.  Yeah,  just for today.  You know what,  I'll do that right now.  I'm glad DJ Hookett is here  because we were talking  about your Instagram  earlier today.  Where were you?  Yeah,  we were watching  the Instagram video 
[04:55:30]  of you making  booties box.  Booty boxes.  That was kind of crazy  right there.  Yeah,  what were those women wearing?  Barely nothing.  It seemed like  just dental floss.  Just some floss.  The smell was serious though.  It was.  Sweaty assholes.  It's like sardines.  But in a good way or?  Well,  I'm a pervert  so it smelled great.  You liked it.  If you missed that discussion,  the West Coast replay  Salty.  Starts right after this  but what I was gonna say  is I can help everybody.  Yeah,  help nigga.  I can help you  by telling you  about what USA

[04:56:30]  for sustaining  relationships,  friendships,  and most occupations.  Fuck you talking about?  Johnny,  I'm trying to explain.  Johnny,  played by Michael Mosley,  is a good-looking,  sports-loving  Chicago EMT  working with his  best friend Hank,  played by Kevin Daniels.  Brian,  played by Kevin Bigley,  is a wide-eyed  and excitable new EMT  who still lives  with his parents.  Yeah.  Fucking loser.  Dennis Leary  and Bob Fisher  bring their distinct  brand of edgy comedy  to USA Network 
[04:57:00]  with Sirens.  As these guys see it,  funny things happen  when you save lives  for a living.
