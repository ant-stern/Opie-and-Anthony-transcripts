<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting his experience at a Details magazine party,  detailing his initial rejection,  a chance encounter with the *Clerks* cast, and eventual entry. He described seeing celebrities, including Gary Coleman, who became a source of amusement for some attendees.  Opie expressed jealousy and accused Anthony of "selling out," sparking a recurring argument throughout the segment.  Listener calls followed, echoing Opie's sentiments and adding jokes about Anthony's perceived social climb.  The discussion then abruptly shifted to a story about Spaz, a show staffer, who believed he'd been urinated on from a high-rise building, prompting absurd speculation and comedic tangents.  Finally, a news item about Britney Spears rejecting an $11 million sex offer fueled further raunchy humor and speculation from the hosts and callers.  The segment ended with continued ribbing of Rick, a show staffer, for attending a Loverboy concert.

The show continued with more ribbing of Rick, laden with homophobic slurs and suggestive comments from the hosts and callers.  This transitioned into a discussion about a biologist's claim that rape is biologically inherent in men.  This sparked a heated, highly offensive debate with the hosts, callers, and a female guest, Trish, who discussed violent and dominant sexual fantasies. Mike Tyson, present in the studio, participated in a graphically offensive role-play with Trish. The segment concluded with a call from a high school student, Matt, seeking advice on having sex with his prom date.  The hosts, callers, and Mike Tyson provided crude and sexually suggestive "advice," along with discussions about sexual slang and prom night expectations.  A game attempting to guess callers' race based on their voices ended this portion of the show.


The next segment involved a similar game focusing on guessing callers' race and gender from their voices, marked by humorous, yet stereotypical exchanges. This was followed by an appearance by Nikki, the singer from the band "Raise Hell."  Initially amused, the hosts turned increasingly hostile and mocking, prompting Nikki to become upset and leave. After a period of reflection, the hosts apologized and invited her back.  The segment concluded with a call from a Ronald Reagan impersonator, delivering darkly comedic and offensive jokes about the former presidentâ€™s health and family.

A game called "King Gimp" followed, featuring audio clips of heavily slurred speech. Callers guessed what "King Gimp" was saying, with answers filled with vulgar language and sexual references. A caller criticized the segment's tastelessness and mockery of a medical condition. Despite this, the game proceeded, with callers winning prizes. A radio station expressed interest in hiring King Gimp for commercials, sparking discussion about the potential ratings boost. The segment ended with playful banter and mentions of other planned segments, including a prostate exam.

George Whipple, I guess his name is  Yeah, I know who you're talking about  Yeah, the big guy  And he was there with his camera crew and stuff 
[00:03:00]  And then, you know, I see Mark Golan say hi  Nice party  Where's the bar?  And of course, he knew right away  So they're mixing some pretty strong drinks there too, helping  I gotta tell you  Had a couple of absolutes and orange juice  Sure  Loosen up so I could, you know, mingle with the beautiful people  Sure  Yeah  You're changing, man  Shut up!  Why are you hanging with these people?  I was supposed to meet Rick and Ben there  And we were gonna goof on there  I never thought I'd see the day that Ant would be hanging with the beautiful people 
[00:03:30]  You're at the same party as Madonna  What is going on with you, man?  And I saw Lisa Ling from The View  Yeah  I didn't want to say anything to her  Just in case she heard any Star Jones comments  And then  Are you networking, Anthony?  Oh, I'm moving and shaking, I'll be  Are you gonna be on The View soon?  Shut up!  I saw Michael Buffer  The Let's Get Ready to Rumble guy  Yeah  And then the biggest celebrity of them all comes in 
[00:04:00]  Not Madonna  No  Gwyneth Saltrow, she was there, no?  Not her?  Uh, no, no, no  I didn't see her or Madonna  Okay  They must be in like the back back room where it's a sludge like me and not allowed to go  No?  Gary Coleman  Gary Coleman  Comes in  All of a sudden I just see this little short black guy walk by  I was like  Oh my god, look, it's Gary Coleman  And then all the brothers, like there are a bunch of hip hop guys there and stuff  Are around Gary Coleman shaking his hand but laughing  They're like 
[00:04:30]  Ah, look at his mother after Gary Coleman  Look at his short hand  Tell me I love him  You know, and they're all like goofing on him  And he turned around and like walked right out again  Alright, I gotta put someone in their place  Michelle, what's up?  Opie, I think you're jealous of Anthony  Uh, no, why would you say that?  Because I got to hang out with the beautiful people and you didn't  Michelle, let me set you straight, okay?  Uh-huh  Both of us were invited to the party  It was a no brainer for me to say, no thank you  Why?  Because I didn't want to go, I don't like, I don't like hanging out at those places 
[00:05:00]  You think I go to hang out?  First of all, I just wanted to say congratulations and hello to good friend of the show, Mark Golan  Right  Who was the editor of details, that's one reason I went  And for your liquor  If we did that at the corner bar and played like, I don't know, video games or something, I'd go  You don't think it would be fun to hang out with me and Rick and Ben and goof on the New York guys  If we had our little gang together and we had a corner table and we could goof on all the beautiful people 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, but you went by yourself  I didn't know what was going on  We all blew off the party and you still went  I didn't know  That's what makes me go, what the heck is that all about?  You do make a good point  If we had our little group of guys together and we were at a table, yeah, I would have loved it  Because then we could have goofed on everything  Yeah, that's what those are all about  What do you think, I'm going there to mingle with people?  There were so many, like, look-alike people  You're walking around and it's like, oh my god, here it is  Were you smoking cigars with Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that's what I was doing  I was just networking  There were a whole bunch of JFK Jr. look-alikes  Hey, Joe  Why wouldn't you want to go there last night?  There's probably a lot of rich chicks there, you know?  I don't, it's not my scene  Oh, and it's mine  All right, get a message over there  Hey, and it's mine?  That's what I'm trying to say  Dude, come on!  I think Ant and I are like, kind of like going our own ways  God, stop leaving, what are you going to do?  Shut up!  What are you on, drugs? 
[00:06:30]  It used to, it used to that both of us would blow this off, it wasn't our scene  But I guess it's now Anthony's scene, what can I tell you?  Yeah  Is he selling out, Opie?  I think he's selling out  I'm selling out  He's sitting here, across from me  He's got one of those shiny black suits on now  His nose up in the air, right?  Come on!  He's got a supermodel waiting for him outside the studio  You know, he's left me behind, what can I say?  You're in New York, all of a sudden he's a star now  Right, you know?  So much for the days of just getting hammered at the local pubs 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, right?  Yeah, that's my scene  You should have seen how out of place  Like Earl at a Klan meeting  That's how out of place I was  Believe me  And are you sure you have enough time to go to the Yankee game with us tonight?  Or do you have one of these little  Parade  There's a Parade to go to  With Glennis  And Madonna  I think Esquire Magazine is having a party tonight  Do you go to that?  You're a tool, man  I can't believe it  Are you hoping the Yankees, you know, score early so they can leave for another shindig?  Maybe you'll get on the fashion show with Joe Rivers, eh? 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I enjoyed the head and the ponytail  But the t-shirt  You know how to do something different  Anthony on the red carpet  Is that what your goal is?  Is that what your goal is?  Is that what your goal is?  Shut up, you jerk  I'm listening to you  Alright, thanks, guys  Have a good day  Alright, here they come  I gotta tell you  Uh, more gay guys at this party  Uh, gay guys  Than I've ever seen in my life  Holy smoke  You couldn't turn around with two seconds about two guys in a lip lock 
[00:08:00]  Uh, George  Yo, Ant, man, what's going on?  You're leaving your boy behind  He was...  He should've come to this party  I didn't wanna go  Crying, man, no  Well, which one of these is gonna say you don't bring me flowers anymore?  You know, it was supposed to be one of those things where we go to and like just hang out and go  Did you do any blow with any of these top-notch celebrities, Anthony?  Oh, I was coking, packing my face with cocaine  Free cocaine was just flowing like crazy  No, I wasn't doing drugs 
[00:08:30]  So we're all scared  A lot of the faithful listeners are even scared  They're thinking, uh, Anthony might be coming a sell-out now  Well, that he's gonna be spending more time with the beautiful people instead of us  If you saw how out of place I was at this shindig  It was retarded  The help looked better than I did at this party  Believe me  By the way, Ant, your invitation for the puffy party came  Oh, good, good, please  Tell him an RSVP for me, would you, Rick?  Were you hanging with Al B. Shore last night, Anthony? 
[00:09:00]  Uh, Don, what's up?  What's up?  I just wanna know if Anthony's gonna start changing the show a little bit  Adding in a little Madonna music  A little Michael Jackson  Oh, yeah, yeah  That's it  My new, close personal friend  Did Madonna ask you to be  I'm thinking Rick  I didn't see Madonna  And I hope you told, uh, Anthony that they were all gonna go  And they're probably laughing their asses off right now  Yeah  And he actually went  That's what I'm thinking  All you guys can spy it against me  Yeah, we're all going, Ant  We'll meet you there 
[00:09:30]  And I walk in alone  Ant, is it true you...

Our audience blows, man  They're all a bunch of tools  Mr. High Society now, huh?  High Society, 1027, I love it  It used to be we both came into work, talked about the show and stuff  Now if I want to talk to Anthony, I gotta go through his agent  Yeah, so I had a Christie Brinkley show for me 
[00:10:30]  I don't know how they're doing on the Hamptons over there  Unbelievable  I go to one little shindig  I thought, to tell you the truth  Yeah  I thought this party was going to be like the one we went to for Maxim  Which was about a year ago  And that was more my style  There was like...  No celebrities  In the Maxim office, I believe  Right  It was like an office party  There was a pinball machine set up  And they were having a pinball tournament  And it was a little small buffet  A tub with some beers thrown in it on ice 
[00:11:00]  That's more my style  I like that  I get there last night  There's laser lights  It's techno friggin' blasting music in this warehouse  Dance  Oh yeah, Rick, I was raising the roof  That's it  Me and Gwyneth were tripping the light fantastic  You friggin'  Were you doing the mambo?  Yeah, mambo number five  Yeah  That's what I was doing  Can we go find some music for Anthony  So he feels comfortable today  Oh, sure  Oh, man  Can we lower the lights, too?  Yeah, we can lower the lights  Did you get one of Donald Trump's leftovers, Anthony? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that's it  Yeah  That's what I was doing  Jesus, man  I hear Anthony's becoming a real sellout  He's going to go make a movie now  Now that you've made all your connections  Yeah, I was really networking  I'm standing in a corner like a wallflower  Oh, yeah, that's what happened  Sipping my drink  Yeah, I'm sure that's how it was  Jack, what's up?  Check his hands for a manicure, please  And also, how gay is that situation sound?  Some guy lingering with a bunch of fags 
[00:12:00]  You made that special point to say  There's the most gay people you've seen in the whole life  I was just saying there was a lot of gay people there  A lot of gay people  Looking for a little action later that night?  No  Yeah, that's what I was doing  Oh, you got me  Dude, I cannot tell you how out of place I was at this shindig  Believe me  Yeah, we all believe you  Brian, what's up?

We will take you anywhere you'd like to go tonight, sir, and I'll make sure we have the carpet out for you, sir.  I think he needs to go to the Esquire party tonight.  Oh, is that where I'm booked to go?  Or is it Glamour Magazine tonight? 
[00:16:30]  I need a chink to hold my umbrella if it's raining like Cassie Lee.  Yeah, Tom and Nicole's people called.  They're all set for Sunday.  Oh, thank you, Rick, for setting that up.  That was such a goof, man.  I go to a party that we were invited to to support Mark Golan, and I catch hell because Madonna was there.  There's pictures all over the post.  I'm surprised you didn't have any of them.  I haven't seen any pictures yet.  There's Gwyneth Paltrow hugging Madonna.  That's the same party you were at.  What happened to going to the strip clubs after the show? 
[00:17:00]  I would still go to the strip clubs.  Are you allowed to ride the subway still to the stadium tonight for the game, or do we have to meet you out front?  I'm riding the damn subway.  I'm so different.  I'm going to these parties all the time.  I'm going to helicopter you in just in time for the game?  Jesus, how does this happen?  How do you have to take the limo to read some movie scripts?  I mean, what the hell's going on with you?  Come on, man. 
[00:17:30]  Paul, what's up?  Anthony, first of all, we all know that I don't like that fair-faced partners of your dopey, okay?  We know that's right off the bat.  But you, you backstab dopey.  Shame on you.  How did I backstab?  Just yesterday, he was saying about how you guys are not like Howard.  You don't go for the approval of anybody.  And this place of your little you goes dancing.  And you put glitter on your hair, two of your fans, what's the matter with you?  Come on, what do you want to hand your appointment out?  Come by, do your nails too?  Don't chase yourself. 
[00:18:00]  Shame on you.  You don't want to understand why I was there.  Paul, I hate you too, but you're pretty funny today, man.  Does anyone understand why I was there?  I've said it a thousand times.  It was there because Rick and Ben were showing up, and we were going to goof on this.  If you don't understand by now, this is like an intervention.  We're a little scared.  This wasn't like it.  You've been heading in this direction for a while.  Okay, so you think, I went to this party thinking, oh boy, I got an invite.  This is great.  This is going to be my in to New York's high society. 
[00:18:30]  I'm going to rub elbows with celebrities.  I'm going to network.  This is going to be great for me.  Or, hey, this will be a good goof.  Me, Rick, Ben, we'll hang out.  We'll have some free drinks and goof on the celebrities.  Which one sounds more like me?  The first one.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That is so far from the truth, man.  Yeah.  So far from the truth.  De Niro's on line seven, one's acting in his next movie. 
[00:19:00]  O.J. on line nine, was that party with act?  Gee, it's all out.  So when do you run for office?  Do you have to be famous for a few more years?  Yeah, yeah, then I'll do that whole thing.  All right, all right.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  You're on to me.  Well, it's all the cats out of the bag.  I'm a big high society homo.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:19:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, where's Spaz?  Spaz has to get over here.  He started telling me something during commercial break.  And I'm just like, no, no.  We need this on the air.  Spaz always trying to educate us.  O.P.  Yes. 
[00:20:00]  So he was trying to enlighten me on, I don't know.  I'm hearing rumors about something that happened to you on the streets today.  I was walking into the building today and something wet was hitting my head.  Something wet was hitting your head?  Yes.  And what do you think this wetness was?  Well, I looked up at the sky and there was no clouds where I was standing.  Right.  And there was nobody, like, squeegeeing the windows.  So I was just wondering where we were coming from.  And it wasn't a bird.  It was just dripping all over my jacket and my book bag in my head. 
[00:20:30]  I'm like, okay.  Yeah.  And what do you think it is now?  Because I heard some people helped you out with what was going on up in the sky.  It could be somebody was leaking off the roof or out the window.  Taking a leak.  And taking a leak.  A little warning to your fellow New Yorkers.  Do you honestly believe someone was taking a leak on you?  That was the explanation that I got.  I didn't know what happened.  And somebody told me that I was taking a leak.  There's probably 20 explanations before that that I would think of before someone peeing on you in a building where the windows don't open. 
[00:21:00]  That's the only explanation I got.  I don't know how long.  So I don't like it.  Uh-uh.  That's just Ant's opinion.  I want you to have the spaz opinion, what you think happened to you today and what you could say to your fellow New Yorkers to warn them against this.  Atrocity, what?  You washed your hair three times in the bathroom? 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  Which I didn't really want to do because when I wash it, it gets fluffy.  It's poofy.  Now, wow, I'm amazed.  Someone peed on my head out of the building where the windows don't open.  And it could have been a building, right?  And it could have been a construction site, you know.  When was this now, yesterday?  This morning.  Oh, this morning.  Look at his hair.  It's all poofy.  It gets poofy when I wet it. 
[00:22:00]  I had it flattened.  It gets wavy, too.  Can I?  I have to give you at least three other things it could have been.  I mean, I...  No, and if you're going to do that, then let him do his rant first.  Okay.  I can't do the rant right now.  I've got to do it tomorrow.  I've got to build up more anger.  God, I've got to...  You've got to build up more anger.  You're convinced someone leaked on your head and you need to build up more anger?  What's the problem?  Who are these people leaking on your head? 
[00:22:30]  Who do you believe they are?  You've got to have an idea.  Some kids might go...  I know people like to play pranks.  Some kids might go up to the top of the roof and say, you know, hey, I'm going to whiz on somebody's head.  How many...  Are there possibly 40 floors?  On this building?  It's a 40-story building that we're in.  They might have good aim.  They use smart pee.  Like you see in Baghdad, the missiles, remember those?  That went down the air conditioning shaft? 
[00:23:00]  They have smart penises.  It could be construction workers.  Construction workers on the roof of the building.  And they said, hey, look, there's spaz, 40 stories down.  I'm going to take a leak, compensate for wind, all kinds of...  Wind eddies off the building, altitude, and I'm going to pee on them.  And you've got to realize they're going to have to lead their leak because you're walking.  No, because not.  What I did was because I felt the drip, so I stopped and I looked up. 
[00:23:30]  Let me tell you something.  A frigging bathtub of water dropped off a 40-story building.  You might feel a drop.  You might feel a drop on you.  A bathtub full of water.  The dispersal, it would be amazing.  Maybe it was a giant mosquito.  Oh, that could be.  It's venom.  All right, spaz, you need to rant about this problem.  So who do you think this is?  What is it?  And why did it?  You must have felt very angry.  Is it some type of conspiracy?  You must have felt violated.  No, it's just that it was very weird.  I was walking here and there were some clouds here. 
[00:24:00]  But then I stopped in one place.  There was no clouds.  It was like a circle around a bright blue sky.  Oh, like the eye of a storm.  And then all of a sudden, that's when I felt the drips.  You felt drips.  Underneath that one spot.  How much?  How does it take that stock?  He's as dumb as a boxer rock.  His lips are tracking so many times to talk.  This is it, so we can review it fast. 
[00:24:30]  It's some f***.  That's pretty good.  Look at that, you got a little jingle.  You got a jingle for your weekend review starting tomorrow.  Now, how much actual liquid was on you?  I got to know.  Well, I saw spotty stuff on my leather coat.  A couple of spots on your leather coat.  Yes.  And then my hair was a little bit drenched.  It was like a little bit like a little wet.  Bam.  Bam.  Over your entire head?  Yeah.  Well, actually, it dripped down like the back of my neck just a little bit. 
[00:25:00]  Do you understand that we did have some rain this morning?  I felt some raindrops.  There was some rain this morning.  But that's the weird part about it.  I specifically went under this circle of blue sky that we...  Dude, do you know how hot...  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  I'm amazed.  What is it?  A cartoon where a cloud goes right over your head and it rains on you?  Don't you think that the clouds surrounding this clear area could pepper you with water? 
[00:25:30]  Rain?  That maybe is being carried by the wind?  Don't you know those clouds are so high up that you could see a cloud that looks like  it's a mile away above you, but you could be getting hit with the rain from that cloud  because the wind takes it over to you?  There was no wind.  The wind was going maybe one mile away.  Do you know about winds aloft?  Do you know that there are different wind levels?  The wind could be going in a completely different direction 20,000 feet above your head than  it is here on the ground where you're protected by buildings and whatnot. 
[00:26:00]  He believes he got leaked on it.  I understand.  I'm going to have to take his side on this one.  Okay, leaked on it.  It couldn't possibly be maybe that it was raining.  Maybe he says there were no clouds in the area.  Maybe it rained and...  Were there clouds in the sky at all?  There were clouds, but I was under the spot where there was no clouds.  Right, that magical circle that follows you around.  How about maybe it rained and there was a puddle on the roof of some building and wind blew  and some of that water was carried and landed on you. 
[00:26:30]  How about air conditioning systems, which leak condensation all over the city?  Sometimes you'll be walking around all of a sudden, there's air conditioning.  I'm with Spaz.  If he thinks he got leaked on, I have to go with him.  That's just one thing that's probably more possible.  Well, I'm not saying that's what it is, but he got leaked on.  I think he would know if he got leaked on it.  Leaked on.  So what?  So now you're angry and you want to vent about people that pee on other people from great heights? 
[00:27:00]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  And now because of that, you had to wash your hair three times and it's now poofy.  It gets poofy every time I wash it.  In a related subject, Spaz, that's not moose in your hair.  I am fascinated by this man.  I am stupefied.  I am stupefied.  Dude, politics and socks.  He's as dumb as a box of rocks.  His lips are lacking when he tries to talk. 
[00:27:30]  This is it so we can review it fast.  He's some f***.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightling News.  This just in.  People leaping on other people in Manhattan.  Unbelievable, the amount of compliments coming in from people being drenched by urine that is being peed onto people's heads from great heights. 
[00:28:00]  You may ask yourself, geez, I can't even hit the toilet bowl when I'm standing in my own bathroom without hitting the rim and getting it all over the sheet so the girls complain.  But from 40 stories high above the windy streets of downtown Manhattan, somebody is peeing on pedestrians.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightling News.  An exclusive story. 
[00:28:30]  The people being peed on.  This is a new form of terrorism in our Paris city, comparable to the World Trade Center bombing.  We now have the World Trade Center peeing.  People are really observational back of the World Trade Center peeing down on people on the West Side Highway.  It's quite amazing.  Let's get this quote from a man on the street that has been peed on.  Sir?  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[00:29:00]  You heard it here first, by the way, I'm going to be a super-yousel student.  Unbelievable.  How do the streams stay together over 40 stories?  How does wind affect this?  How are they aiming?  We'll have scientists that are educated in fluid technologies on the show later to tell us how this is.  Hey, Tom, are you going to explain the theory of the circle?  The clear sky in the middle of the clouds? 
[00:29:30]  Yes, yes, our own weatherman, Mr. G, will be coming on and explaining the extreme phenomenon.  Holes in the sky above sky's edge.  Unbelievable cloud formations that keep the skies clear above moron's edge.  What's happening in our fair city?  Tom Brogan, we've seen 9 million years.  Tom, maybe it's King Kong taking a leak on everybody. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, I never thought of that.  We'll send a camera crew right now to the Empire State Building.  God checking in.  God?  Hello, boys.  How are you today?  Pretty good.  Hello, God.  Even God has a bad car phone.  I thought you would get the good one, but I guess not.  Hi, God.  I'm calling to let you know that I peed on Kevin's head because I cannot even forgive him for being so effing stupid.  All right.  Thank you, God.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, it's funny, Beth. 
[00:30:30]  Keep it.  Keep it.  So effing.  You're so effing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa. 
[00:31:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on!  Come on! 
[00:31:30]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  No fun!  Whoa!  No fun!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  In this segment, Urine from the Sky 
[00:32:00]  A new form of terrorism sweeping the city  Young vandals 40 stories up peeing on pedestrians 
[00:32:30]  We'll have Mayor Guderianne's response to this later  Remember, that's the big story tonight  The funniest part of that whole thing was that it sped up like that  Rain just keeps falling down my head  There was no wind, I didn't feel anything whistle into my ears  Spaz, you don't seem amused at this point  You okay?  It's a serious subject  Very serious 
[00:33:00]  You're an extreme terrorist high above our city  Perhaps even using enemy aircraft  Perhaps not even in buildings  Perhaps they're hiding in the landing gears of airplanes  Spaz, out of these three things, tell me which is the most serious, okay?  Giant mosquitoes attacking our fine city  Cancerous live wires  Or people leaking on your head as you're trying to walk to work  Which would be the most serious of the three? 
[00:33:30]  I would have to say the cancerous live wires  Okay  Cancerous live wires!  All right  By the way, thank you for the cancerous live wires window decals  That's so much sense  Yeah, you see that?  It's got cancerous live wires  And then the red circle at the flash throw  We've been getting a pretty good laugh out of those  So thank you for sending those into the show  All right, what would be the second most serious out of the three?  I would have to say the mosquito  Giant mosquito 
[00:34:00]  All right  And then so leaking on your head really doesn't seem that bad  It's more of a moral matter  There it is, Colonel Gibbett's in the Enola Gay  Flying above the city of New York  A fuselage, belly, laden with urine  Spraying it down on unsrespecting pedestrians  This could bring an end to the wall  Colonel Gibbett's rolling down the runway  The implement of destruction  Tanks and tanks of urine in her belly  Oh my God 
[00:34:30]  Hey, Lo, what's up?  Oh, God, are you killing me?  Now I know why you keep fast on  No one that stupid can be allowed to run out into the public  It's amazing  Oh my God, I can't believe how dumb the guy is  In fact, did you ever hear of something called a sun shower?  Oh my God  A sun shower, and what is a sun shower?  Sun shower  A sun shower is when there are very little white clouds 
[00:35:00]  I believe they're the cumulus clouds  Or the stratos  Oh my God  They're around the sun  And  What, what, what?  Wait a minute, the clouds are where?  Around the sun?  Around the sun?  It looks like that  How far from the sun would you say these clouds are?  I really don't know  I would have to say eons  Eons?  Eons is a time frame, not a distance  That's a Chevy Chase reference, you idiot  I didn't know that  You're ripping off Chevy Chase  I didn't know  Anyway, that guy's going to come in here and beat you out 
[00:35:30]  So now a sun shower, you look up  And  Are you saying that you see clouds and there's a sun shower?  Yes, but they're whitish, not so gray as clouds  But  The shower that there was  There was a center  Where there was just a blue sky  Holy mother  So it can't possibly rain from a blue sky  Wow  Of course it can  It's blue  There's nothing, there's no clouds  To rain  Except it's blue  Oh my God  Oh my dear sweet Jesus 
[00:36:00]  This is impossible  He walks and breathes  So there's got to be something in there  At least for involuntary action  Is there just like a medulla  Doesn't that just control like heart rate and breathing  To make sure you just don't drop dead  People can live without brains, right?  People live in hospitals and breathe and live quite well  But they're brain dead  Brain dead people can still breathe  Thank you, Steve  I was very curious as to that 
[00:36:30]  Oh my God  Dude, it is totally possible for it to be sprinkling on you  When you look up and see complete blue skies  And sun just shining  How?  Where's the rain coming from?  It can't be coming from the sun  It can  Yes it can  No, no  It can rain  First of all  It can be from clouds  That you are seeing  Way away from you  The winds are bringing the water to you  Winds aloft 
[00:37:00]  Also, water can just condense in the air  Without forming clouds  Or it can be blue ice from those jets flushing their toilet  So maybe you're right  You did get some urine on your head  Whoa!  Okay  Come on  Some food  Some food  Or  No 
[00:37:30]  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  C  No  Don't eat the brown snows, Fez.  What was that?  Amelia.  Amelia, what's up?  Hi. 
[00:38:00]  Hi.  Is he for real, this guy?  I just can't even believe that he would think that he got peed on.  I've got to tell you, I was outside having a cigarette break today,  and I looked up, and out of a clear blue sky, I'm getting spritzed on,  and now I realize there was a construction site close by,  and I was probably being spritzed with urine.  See?  I mean, you know, I'm glad that he exposed this,  because now I know to be careful when I'm walking the streets of Manhattan.  Well, there you have it, Seth.  Deadly urine-throwing terrorists in New York City. 
[00:38:30]  Could this be spreading to other major metropolitan areas in our country?  Stay tuned to NBC Nightly News as we continue with Urine from the Sky.  Special report.  Unbelievable.  Did you ever pee off a roof of a house, even?  Or any altitude?  Maybe rocks on a jetty at the beach or something.  I mean, pee at any altitude. 
[00:39:00]  It's just the side of something.  Do you see the breakup of the thing?  You don't have laser beams coming out of there.  It disperses.  It just...  By the time it hits the ground from 40 floors,  it looks like a perfume out of an atomizer.  It's gone.  There weren't thick drops.  I just really thought he wasn't...  I'm amazed.  The clouds are around the sun.  All right.  Let's see. 
[00:39:30]  Eons away from us.  Okay.  Thank you, Spice.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  One of them, WNW.  Britney Spears is in the news.  Britney?  Yeah, Britney Spears is in the news.  Yeah.  Today, what is this?  Someone, some guy offered her cash for sex?  Stunned pop star Britney Spears has a...  What?  Stunned pop star Britney Spears has had an indecent proposal of $11 million to go to bed with an infatuated American businessman, I think. 
[00:40:00]  The 19-year-old singer flatly refused the offer and vows to remain a virgin until her wedding night.  Virgin.  Last night, talking exclusively to the sun, she said,  It's a disgusting offer.  You should go and have a cold shower and leave me alone.  It's outrageous how a man like that can offer something which is totally unacceptable.  Britney added,  I don't believe in sex before marriage. 
[00:40:30]  I go out with boys and we can't sit past this.  I want to wait until I get married before I sleep with anyone.  How about $5 million for our BJ?  Come on, Britney.  The unnamed man made his approach through Britney's record label, Dive Records.  Can we call him up and offer $20 million?  I swear to God.  Like, how does this make the news?  Like, what if we offered $20 million?  Right, we're there.  The offer's out there.  $20 million, we put you on the rotissory play cards on your back. 
[00:41:00]  To your music.  If I could put a cigarette out there, it's fine.  Y'all, imagine that?  Hey.  Okay, your turn.  Oh, look at where I'm going.  Right in the dumper.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  A virgin?  She's a virgin?  Who's she been seen with?  Who's the guy?  There's been a couple of them boy band guys, right?  One of the guys from Instinct.  I think she just wants to cover up for being a virgin by dating him, and he wants to cover  up for being a fake.  So it's like a good beard, you know what I mean?  You know what?  She didn't go for the offer because she doesn't need the money.  Yeah.  If she needed it. 
[00:42:00]  $11 million for a little sex, a little intercourse.  I think most ladies would take that deal if they didn't need the money.  Come on.  $11 million for a little love in one night.  One night only.  $19 million.  She's a virgin.  Boy, that's...  It's like seeing a Ferrari parked in someone's driveway.  Never seen a drive.  Never even seen him open the doors.  Why ain't he driving that thing?  $19 million.  What a waste. 
[00:42:30]  What a waste.  What do you think?  What do you think?  How old before she loses it?  20?  21?  Yeah, tops.  How's she moving around and singing about getting effed and she's never done it before?  What's this about?  Do I ask?  Yeah.  It's a song, or is it?  It's a song about being a CT.  Is it?  I think.  I'm not that innocent. 
[00:43:00]  I'm not that innocent.  Yes, you are.  I mean...  It's a joke, isn't it?  What are the rest...  Well, give me some other song titles off of this.  Because I bet there's at least one that's about effing.  I can't get no satisfaction.  Well, that's the guy that she's dating, then.  Don't go knocking on my door.  Whoa, maybe she's right.  Don't go knocking on my door.  Virgin.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Don't let me be the last to know.  Huh?  What you see is what you get.  Well...  That's an invitation.  Yeah.  Lucky.  You'll be very lucky if you get in her pants.  One kiss from you.  That's all you're going to get.  Where are you now?  Virgin.  Oosh. 
[00:44:00]  I know the song on here.  Oosh, my cornhole.  Come on.  Oosh, my cornhole.  That might be a typo.  I'm sorry.  Where are you now?  We did that one.  Can't Make You Love Me.  Wow.  When Your Eyes Say It and Dear Diary.  The tracks from the new Britney Spears album.  Your Face in My Laugh, is it one?  Uh, no.  No?  Huh.  That's interesting. 
[00:44:30]  Huh.  I'm not that innocent.  I don't know what she means by that.  Apparently you are.  Turning down 11 million to get banged.  Is that hidden track, uh, Cleveland Steamer?  Is that a hidden track on that one?  Right?  Because she's into that?  Oops, there goes your yam bag.  Banana juice on my chest.  Boy, who's the lucky chap that's going to get to unleash on those? 
[00:45:00]  Poof.  Get out of here.  Wow, there's a lot of feedback coming in.  Hold on.  Let me see what these sickos are coming up with here.  Did it again.  All right, want to hear a little more of that?  The QVC guy should sell Britney Spears.  Oh, you're very naughty. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, imagine that.  A limited offer.  Limited time, one time only.  There's only one of a kind.  Once the hymn is broken, it can't be brought back, people.  Nineteen years old.  Nineteen.  This is tighter than a number two pencil, people.  You'd have trouble edging in a number two pencil.  She's like a pencil shark.  We're talking 19-year-old version.  Be dialing. 
[00:46:00]  Let's look at this one closed up.  Let me open it up for you.  Take a look.  Unbelievable.  I can't even fit in a McGuire rookie card.  Look how tight it is here.  Eleven million dollars, people.  Be dialing.  And a rookie card from Sosa.  Look at that.  Sammy Sosa rookie card. 
[00:46:30]  Look, I can't even get a knuckle in it.  And I wouldn't try it because it would ruin it for you.  You're paying.  You get to open it.  Unopened Britney Spears, people.  Be dialing.  We don't usually get 19-year-old versions on the program.  Usually it's smelly baseball cards and bubblegum.  I can't even get a knuckle in it.  I can't even get a knuckle in it.  Look at here, people. 
[00:47:00]  I'm trying to insert a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card.  It ain't going in.  Just think of the pleasure you're going to get plowing this whole bag.  Order now.  And you get the Olsen twins.  When available.  Unbelievable.  Be dialing.  Dyson's going to do a song with Britney.  Oops, look what I did to you again. 
[00:47:30]  Just think of what anal's going to be like.  I can barely keep it in my pants just looking at it.  I'm ready to file this package.  Call now, people.  One of a kind.  Listen to her sing.  Just imagine ramming it home when she's singing this.  Be there.  All right, I can't take it. 
[00:48:00]  I've got to take it myself.  It's off the market.  Look.  Look, I'm banging this whole bag on national television.  Look, get my buddy over here.  You just.  Get in there.  Look, I'll loop.  Here we go.  Go to town.  John from Lennon, New Jersey.  Hey, guys, apparently Stockbroker Dave has moved on to bigger and better things than 
[00:48:30]  wins Stockbroker Dave's money.  Yeah.  Offer in 11 mil.  That's an obscure reference, and we like it.  Yankee Bleacher, Anthony checking in from New York.  Britney Spears is a virgin, and Spaz is intelligent and bright.  The worst of Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What up? 
[00:49:00]  I saw this chick one time.  This African-American lady, a little bit of a big bike.  And the spandex pin, the spandex pin was so tight on her.  She had put on so much powder, I guess, that she dried that.  Spandex were black.  The powder is actually white, of course.  And it started to show all around the crack.  It's like, oh, come on.  Do something with that.  You know?  It's like, if you can't wear it, don't wear it.  It's as simple as that.  Yeah.  I'm saying so. 
[00:49:30]  The guys are the greatest, man.  Keep it up.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Some people don't, like, realize that it's time to move on to larger size clothes or losing the weight.  They're still wearing what they wore.  The funniest is sometimes if you go to, hey, some 80s reunion concert, you know,  some band that was big in the middle 80s, and the girls wear the same stuff they wore,  they're like, oh, let me go up to the attic or in my closet,  and I'll dig out the old clothes I used to wear to go see Poison or something.  Dig out that Japanese writing sweatshirt. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  And, oh, my God, it was spandex, and everything was stretchy back then.  So, obviously, yeah, they could still get it on.  But, oh, fuck, it doesn't quite look like it did back in 84, you know?  Hold on, Rick.  I went to go see, believe it or not, Loverboy for another station I was working at at the time.  Yeah, we had to go see Loverboy.  It was like two years ago.  He's huge now.  And he's just a big, fat pig now.  Mike Reno, he's still wearing, like, the leather outfits,  but you can tell they let the jacket out because they had to. 
[00:50:30]  Rick, I can't get past the fact that you went and saw Loverboy.  As I said, I had to because the station I had to go,  the station I was working with at the time.  At that point, you quit.  Ladies and gentlemen, during this 15 minutes, Rick is the fag.  Rick is the fag.  If you're keeping a scorecard.  I had to go see Loverboy.  All right.  Didn't want to.  No, that's what we all understand.  Did he turn you loose there, Rick?  Yeah, that's exactly what he did. 
[00:51:00]  He turned me loose.  He bent me over.  It was a great experience.  Oh, see, it was a take on one of the songs.  Yeah, I know.  One of the songs.  All right, thank you.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I don't care how big Rick's arms are,  he's a homo for going to see Loverboy.  Dude, I had to do it for work.  Had to.  I had to.  Are you working for the weekend?  Oh.  You're gay.  I guess if you had to, you'd also go to, I don't know,  Liza Minnelli's show or a Barbra Streisand show. 
[00:51:30]  If I had to, if that's what my job required, of course I would.  Yeah, whatever.  You can't call out sick that night?  Flame on, dude.  Flame on.  You are a flamer.  Hey, Rick, were you rocking to Hot Girls in Love?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's that.  Hey, Rick, you're a pillow biker.  Yeah, Rick, look, he's dancing. 
[00:52:00]  He's raising the room.  That's right, Ann, I'm raising the room, man.  You got me.  Oh, wow.  Aunt knows the words, he's singing.  At least he's not wearing parachute pants.  I didn't wear a freaking parachute pants.  Give me a break.  Sure, prove it to the audience.  I never owned a pair of parachute pants.  What do you keep in your little ankle pocket? 
[00:52:30]  I never owned a pair of parachute pants.  Oh.  I had to go for work, you a-hole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Part of my job.  Yeah.  He's loving this.  You want to be yourself.  Come on, Rick, let's go. 
[00:53:00]  Rick came in with leg warmers today in honor of the 80s.  He was doing the flash stand stand.  You guys done?  No.  No, there's still two minutes left of the song.  Oh, okay, cool.  Let's rock out.  I'm a big homo, listen to Lover Boy, I go to Liza Minnelli concerts.  All right.  You do?  Isolate that.  Isolate that. 
[00:53:30]  Ah, so, Chris, you really think he's a flamer for that?  Chris?  Yeah.  We lost Chris.  All right.  He probably couldn't take the music anymore.  All right, that's good.  Rick, were you working for the weekend?  No, I wasn't working for the weekend, Anthony.  Did you have any working for the weekend contests at your old radio station?  Yeah, was that part of it?  We're working for the weekend to take you to see Lover Boy.  You'll be whisked away with Rick. 
[00:54:00]  With a couple of hot girls in love.  You may be the lucky ones.  We're going to turn you loose this weekend.  Take me to the top, yeah.  Queen of the Broken Hearts.  Is that you, Rick?  I'm just gay.  Yeah.  Play that 80s synthesizer.  You like this, Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, this is great. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I'm a big fag.  My name's Rick and I'm a big fag.  I'm a big fruit.  I take steroids.  My arms are so big.  I want a fat guy.  I'm going to nail that pig. 
[00:55:00]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I heard Rick finally came out of the closet.  It's about time, huh?  I got married last month.  Linda's just a beard to hide my flaming homosexuality.  Walk on, Ricky.  I love when someone puts their foot in their mouth on this show.  Never gets old.  Mitch, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[00:55:30]  So who was it?  Was it the Bay City Rollers that opened for Lover Boy?  Was it Wham or maybe Boy George?  I think it might have been Saga.  Yeah.  I'm sure the Bay City Rollers up there with them light warmers were keeping you interested  before the show was going.  Yeah, Rick, who warmed up for Lover Boy when you saw him last year?  It wasn't last year, you faggot.  Well, I was such a clown.  Who warmed up?  Seriously.  I think it was like a local band in Florida warmed up. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Stupid song off, please.  Rich.  Oh, you love it.  Hey, Rich.  Yeah.  You're on the air, man.  Let's go.  Hey, how you doing there?  All right.  Pretty good.  We've been listening to you guys for a long time.  Anyway, I got a joke about Lover Boy.  Yeah.  What do you call a dance floor at a Lover Boy concert?  What?  A playing throw-up.  All right.  Thank you.  Rick, did you wear your little Mike Reno headband? 
[00:56:30]  No.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rick.  Yeah, Rick.  Do you want to fly, Rick, with Lover Boy?  Oh, it's so fun when it's not you.  Uh, Jack, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I want to stick up for Rick.  I was there, you know.  All right.  It was the benefit to find a cure for gay crabs. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, you guys.  Rick, do you want to stick up for Rick?  They can love whoever I need.  Are you on your knees making love for you whenever you please?  No, I am not on my knees, you dick.  Shut the counter down.  God, I hate being the fan. 
[00:57:30]  It was your turn, though.  Keeping a low profile.  Doesn't help.  Oh, you've just got to say that you went to a Lover Boy concert.  It's all over.  Well, like, you've never gone to a concert that, in retrospect, like a few years later,  you go, Jesus Christ, I should have never went to that show.  I'm not going to say now.  I'm not going to admit it on the air to two million people.  No.  Damn.  Uh-oh.  What?  Just read it already.  Jesus Christ.  Hold on.  Frederick, what's up? 
[00:58:00]  Yo.  Hey.  Rick.  Are you going to go home to the Wham reunion?  Yes, I'll be at the glory hole with George Michael.  Of course I will.  That's what I do.  I hang out with homos.  Is there anything on the instant feedback in or no?  Just 20,000 listings just saying Rick's a homo.  Like, no one's ever seen this goddamn band live.  No one's going to admit it, though.  Tommy, what's up? 
[00:58:30]  Hey.  Hey.  I'll be at the White State concert next week, and I need a date.  You guys suck.  Thank you, Tommy.  Rick's arms got so big from working his meat during the Lover Boy concert.  Oh, too funny.  Uh, Dean, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  My little sister said she sold Rick at a Ricky Martin concert last month. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, that was me.  That was me.  That's great, man.  Yeah, I was dancing and everything.  Hope you enjoyed it.  I'm glad you had the hot cow to wake up your lips.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have to announce Lover Boy for the crowd, Rick?  Be honest.  Oh, no.  Be honest.  Ladies and gentlemen, Lover Boy. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Now, was it Rick or your alter-eco match?  Who was it?  He's throwing things at me.  Oh, I didn't see that.  Let's see how many more...  Oh, man.  He's winging stuff over here.  I got the Lover Boy super hits of the 80s.  Oh, yeah.  Rick's got that one at home.  I just don't recognize...  Yeah, well, that's okay because Opie brought his copy.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I did, Rick.  I just don't recognize any of the other songs, really. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at these guys.  Oh, yeah.  Hot Girls in Love.  Hot Girls in Love.  All right.  Where's the ballad?  Which one's the ballad?  Was that Lucky One 6?  Oh, I remember Lucky One.  Was it?  I don't know.  Ask Rick.  Yeah, Rick.  What was the power ballad?  It's over.  Every band in the 80s had to have the power ballad.  The best Lover Boy thing from the early 80s, MTV.  They had a contest where you could win to be in a Lover Boy video. 
[01:00:30]  Now, how the hell do you remember this?  Because I used to watch MTV 24 hours a day.  I remember this, and I'll tell you who won.  A big fat broad.  A big fat broad won.  And it was the funniest damn thing because they're doing this video out in the desert  or something with these hot chicks.  And they try to put this fat girl that won the contest into this video.  She fit like the square peg in the round hole.  They put her in this leather getup.  It's almost like this road warrior-esque kind of video.  And they had her sitting at this control panel where you could just see her face.  And then a quick shot of her across her shoulder or something. 
[01:01:00]  And then back to, like, the hot babes.  I completely agree.  But it was like, oh, when they pulled that card out and contacted the winner,  it was all like, oh, jeez.  How did this happen?  What?  What?  The abuse is still coming.  Chris, what's going on?  Rick, was that name of the radio station you were for?  W-S-A-G?  Bag!  Bag!  All right, we're just about done, Rick.  Hang in there.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, Rick.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, I think Fazz needs someone to breathe on his private area.  But I think he knows a couple, I think there's a couple openings on some plays that he's in.  That's funny.  Next, Tim.  Yo.  Hey, what's the matter?  Rick didn't want to wear that headband?  He was afraid he was going to mess up his flock of Siegel's haircut.  The Mike Reno headband.  Actually, Rick is sporting the Stray Cat hair dude today.  I am not, you asshole.  He's got the parachute pants on with a zipper on his ankle, and he's got the Stray Cat haircut. 
[01:02:00]  Did Billy Idol come out for an encore or something?  Mike saying, I'm only 14, and I even know Rick is a fruit.  Lover boy, ha-ha.  Homo.  John.  I want to know, now that Rick has proved his gayness and he's a muscle man, does that  mean he's the pitcher?  Very good.  All right.  Thanks.  This guy wants to sing to you, Rick. 
[01:02:30]  All right, Tony.  Yeah.  You want to sing?  I got a song for Rick.  All right, let's hear it.  Everybody's working on Rick's rear end.  Thank you.  Oh, well, we ought to leave Rick alone.  Are you sure, Eric?  Well, so he can prepare for the Culture Club concert he's going to tonight.  Shut your ass.  I'm not going to...  In front of you, I will.  Keep it that way.  Look at all of you, just trolling for another call. 
[01:03:00]  I know.  He's just trolling to just bash me.  I haven't forgotten the beating from last week, trust me.  So you're going to hold that against me because you tried to take me down and I slap you?  Don't hold anything against you.  Look at him.  He wants me to hold parts against him.  Look at this guy, Matt.  Fifteen more minutes for Rick, please.  Jim, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to know if Rick has reached Mac's headroom in his butt. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, Rick, are you going to wag Chung tonight?  Oh, Sean.  I'm just imagining him, like, getting ready for the show, putting his Mike Reno headband on,  and cranking the tube as he drives his fantastic yellow car.  Yeah, getting all psyched for the show.  Did you buy a concert T-shirt and stuff?  Yeah.  I love her boy with all the pictures on it.  One with the torn-off sleeves already. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Big sperm stain on the front, you know, for my boyfriend that left it on me.  Because, you know, I was just before the show.  Oh, come on now.  That's the way it happened.  All right, hold on.  You can't forget that on the radio.  Rick, Rick, you're completely out of control.  How do you think I got those tickets?  All right, relax.  Scott wants to know if you had any man chowder at the Loverboy show. 
[01:04:30]  Go to the concessions, man.  I'll have a hot steaming cup of man chowder.  Ralph wants to know if you could come to his house and suck start at Harley this Saturday.  Is my fag time up yet?  Uh, just about, yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, good.  The timer went on.  6 o'clock.  10 minutes.  All right, cool.  Tune in tomorrow to see who the next fag is as we spin the fag reel. 
[01:05:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Booyah!  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Booyah!  1027 WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  All right, Ant.  You want to get into this rape thing?  What?  What do you mean?  Uh-oh.  They found out.  There's this biologist, Dr. Thornhill, and he says that rape is in every guy. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, like it's just a fact of our biology.  We are biologically inclined to rape.  To rape.  Oh.  The hell is this guy?  I want to hear what his logic is.  All right, listen to this.  Yes, indeed.  Rape is natural, biological, and evolved.  That is, there's no question but that rape is biological.  All right.  I guess the common thought behind rape is that it's not a crime of passion or sex. 
[01:06:00]  It's just a violent act.  And people said that the rapist, it has nothing to do with sex.  It's all about power and violence.  But this guy is saying that it is just a sexual thing.  And it goes back to like caveman time.  Caveman days.  Where we just forced ourselves upon the cave woman.  You ever see that clan of the cave bear?  Who was in that?  Daryl Hannah?  Yeah.  Remember that?  The guy just like, she's down by the lake getting some water bent over. 
[01:06:30]  And the guy just comes up behind her.  Wham!  Slams it home.  Oh, man.  We're going to get into some heavy stuff.  Mike says the rape comment is true, and he'll tell us why.  All right.  Mike, what's your logic?  Okay.  I'm actually a third-year psych major at Hofstra University.  And I'm going to tell you, ego actually wants to suppress rape.  Only because of the superego we get punished.  But internally, we technically want to rape when we're...  What?  Shrink talk.  Yeah, I mean, it's boring, but it's absolutely true.  We are born with the intention to rape. 
[01:07:00]  The only reason we don't do it is because we feel we're going to be punished for it.  Otherwise, we just go out there banging everything in sight.  It's a fact.  Well, isn't that just anything?  Like, we would rob and...  It would, yeah.  Pretty much anything that you're going to do that you would satisfy yourself, that would  satisfy your ego, rather.  Yeah.  That's what you would do, unless you would feel threatened about being punished about it.  Basically, we'd go out, we'd rob, we'd rape, we'd steal.  Yeah, okay.  We would be doing all of that.  Well, everybody's got that thing about if your plane was going down, what would you  do? 
[01:07:30]  Grab the hottest-looking chick next to you and just start going.  Grab a handful of boob and that's it.  Okay.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  At some point, all girls, they want to be raped.  They want to feel that.  Not going to be raped.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Explain yourself.  At some point, I mean, they all have it in them that they want that roughness, not like  they want someone strange.  So I...  Well, wait.  You can't make a blanket statement like that. 
[01:08:00]  Not all girls.  Maybe there's girls that are into the rough sex and maybe want to have some fantasizing.  And I have heard some girls have the rape fantasy.  But to say that all women are into that is...  Yeah, like they would just want a stranger to come up to them and assault them like that.  She wants to get raped.  What?  Oh, my God.  Let's take a...  There's lots of girls that want to get raped.  Oh, really?  It's the truth.  All right, wait.  They want guys to like...  All right, wait.  The girl with the two nipples is back in the studio.  All right, how are you?  What's your name?  Trish.  Trish.  And you want in on this discussion? 
[01:08:30]  I think a lot of girls have fantasies that they want to have more spontaneity and they're,  like, sexual into things and they all have this devian thing and Satanism type of thing  where they want to be, like, handcuffed and thrown down and...  Are you speaking from personal preference?  Well, actually, it's something that I constantly think about that I...  Really?  You want me to, like, move and punch you in the face?  You wouldn't love for this to happen to you?  Yeah.  Well, no, no, I didn't...  No, not punch you in the face.  How about you start running down the hall and we'll have Psycho Mark change it? 
[01:09:00]  I love that.  I would like to chime in on some of this discussion.  Yes, Mike Tyson back in the studio with the megaphone, yes.  I agree with this bitch.  I think every woman wants to get raped.  Come here, honey.  You like that, don't you?  Body blow.  Oh, yeah, look at those boots.  I put them like a speed bag in the gym.  Yeah, I want to crush your face. 
[01:09:30]  You like that, don't you?  So you're saying all the chicks, they like them raped?  I'm not saying all of them, but I'm saying a lot of them fantasize about different things.  Yeah.  I'm not talking to you.  Shut up and bend over.  Okay, baby.  I'm going to give it to you hard.  First, I'm going to...  Here's my foreplay.  Right in the...  I'm going to punch your rectum.  Here we go.  It loosens up the area.  No, don't worry.  I'm used to doing this. 
[01:10:00]  That's what I've been giving.  She loved it.  I would punch her all about the leather Cheerio.  You know what that is, don't you?  Now I'm really pissed because I was in prison for nothing.  She's still saying a girl's life to be raped.  I'm saying that girl's life...  Shut up!  All right.  God damn bitches.  You never want to listen.  You've got a good jaw.  It seems to be working pretty good. 
[01:10:30]  Take that with you.  It works very good.  Hey, Mike, what do you think of her two nipples on her left breast?  That's pretty good.  I'd like to punch it.  There we go.  Look at her boobs are swelling up.  This is cheaper than a boob job.  Look, you're going from a C to a D.  Look, you've got a boob on your chin.  I'll punch you right in there.  Hey, that's good.  Can you bleed out of that nipple?  I'm going to be punching it till you're through. 
[01:11:00]  She did this.  I love that.  Yeah?  You like that?  You want it hard, don't you?  Oh, baby, do it to me hard.  I'll bend you over.  I'll treat you like Spinks.  Remember in that fight I had with him?  I was punching him.  And I wanted to get him in his gappy teeth.  A-F-F.  Jesus. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, you know something?  Mike Tyson could help you.  I am Mike could help you out with that double nipple.  I'll just bite that bitch off.  Come here.  Don't, don't, don't run.  Don't scream so hard.  The police are going to come.  I don't get along with them very well.  And if it's a bitch cop, I'm going to sue her job.  I don't care.  They got a dash, I'm in.  How am I doing? 
[01:12:00]  I'm okay, huh?  Yeah.  Let me pull your hair.  Oh, you scared me like that, don't you?  I love that.  You're not too lubed up.  I think you need a few more party balloons.  Let me see that balloon knot.  You know what a balloon knot is?  No.  You ever blow up a balloon, a party balloon, and you look in the end of it after you tie it up?  You ever do that?  You got a bang in that head, you bitch. 
[01:12:30]  Let me knock you out the skull a little bit.  Let me see if I could draw loose any of them brain cells.  Did you ever blow up a balloon?  Yeah.  You ever blow anything?  Jesus Christ.  You're thicker than my head.  You ever look in a balloon knot?  What does it look like?  It looks like my ass.  Very good.  Hold on. 
[01:13:00]  You got the right answer.  It doesn't look like that.  Sorry.  Mike Tyson's going to give you a Cleveland steamer.  You like that?  You ever hear that one?  It's also called the hot lunch.  It's where you lay on the floor and bombs away with the sticky bombs.  Shut up, goddamn bitches.  She's screaming like she doesn't like me, sticking my fist in there. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to hog-tie you, you bitch.  Can I do a little more foreplay?  I'm going to punch you in your uterus.  There we go.  There we go.  Let me just grab a handful of ovaries.  That's good.  Mike, give me more, Mike. 
[01:14:00]  Give me more, you want more?  Here you go.  Yeah, you keep screaming.  There you go, right in the bone. 
[01:14:30]  We're the training for nothing.  Courtney, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I'm a psychologist also, and I wanted to know that if they were saying from the evolutionary  standpoint, that what, that they like to rape?  I don't know nothing about evolution.  I haven't reached that yet.  That's like puberty for me.  I ain't gone through it.  What else also?  Didn't the cavemen also kill each other to eat food?  I mean, come on.  I still do.  You know that's not what I'd bite the ear off. 
[01:15:00]  I'm still doing that.  You need to tell that guy to put himself into a jail and have him be raped.  Yeah, by me, Mike Tyson.  Exactly.  I mean, Mike loves it.  I heard Mike would give him a good one, too.  I had a couple of boys.  I was in prison.  I would call queens of the waiting room crumb.  It was great.  I'd dress them all up.  They would toss my salad.  A lot of controversy on the show today. 
[01:15:30]  Trish saying that a lot of girls want to be raped today.  I'm not talking to a girl.  And if you need to rape them after, you do this to a few times.  Shut up.  You came to my hotel when you wanted it.  You looked at me.  You wanted it.  You were running down the street screaming.  You wanted it.  Marcy, what's going on?  Yeah, I just want to know how old Trish is.  28. 
[01:16:00]  And what's your education, dear?  What's my education?  Yeah, do you have an education?  Yeah, I went to college for two years.  Really?  Well, spontaneity is not a word.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not, Mike.  Spontaneity.  And, Trisha, if you know anybody that has their legs in the past, it was not a real pleasant experience.  It certainly does not turn people on.  And I really think you're a big bimbo.  You are going to be inspired by Mike.  Shut up, you whore.  Wait a minute. 
[01:16:30]  Can I tell you something?  I'm not talking technically as far as, like, getting attacked and raped and abused and beaten up.  I'm talking about...  I just think you ought to rethink it.  I'm talking about...  All right.  Let me restate it.  I'm talking about a little bit of foreplay where your hair gets pulled, you get spanked around.  It's not anything that's going to physically hurt the woman per se.  Okay, I apologize.  And for us women that listen to O&A, and, you know, I personally enjoy you guys, get out of hand.  I mean, this isn't that a bad message.  I agree with our little hair pulling, maybe a little name calling, some gentle biting in a space shovel over the head. 
[01:17:00]  That's a night out with Iron Mike.  Oh, look, the whore hung up.  Marcy hung up.  Well, it's a sixth statement by this biologist.  Let's play that again.  Yes, indeed.  Rape is natural, biological, and evolved.  That is, there's no question, but that rape is biological.  All right, I'm going out tonight.  Look, look at that.  I'm working out on the heavy bag.  Only if you're a prostate. 
[01:17:30]  Patty, what's going on?  I just wanted to say that as far as, like, women, you know, fantasizing about being raped and everything.  Yes.  As far as myself, you know, if I'm with somebody I trust, it's one thing, but I don't know about women fantasizing about getting raped, you know.  But what about if you're with a big boxer as a convict?  How would you feel then?  Huh?  It doesn't matter how you feel, you bitch.  Bridget.  Yes. 
[01:18:00]  What's up?  What can you add to this?  I just wanted to say that there's a big difference between rape and fantasizing about rough sex.  Not with me.  But the whole true definition of rape is when you get sex against your will.  So if you're fantasizing about sex...  I don't care what that name is, Will, Bob, Pete.  I don't care.  I'm doing more.  Well, I know you don't care about it, Mike, but the point is, I think we need to worry about the line that we're crossing between rape and fantasizing with rough sex. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, it's just...  That's a big difference, obviously.  You know, and I think, you know, I love this show, and I listen to it every day on my drive home.  It makes an hour go by fast.  But we need to, you know, just be careful about the line that we're crossing.  That's all.  Thank you, Bridget.  You know how you stop that?  All the screaming?  Yes.  They say, well, the jaw.  Most bitches I punched, I noticed they got a glass jaw.  They can't even take a punch.  It's like it doesn't even have to be a full right hand.  It can just be like a short arm left or something, and they go right down. 
[01:19:00]  Look, like, watch this one.  Look, get back here.  Look, look, watch.  Down.  It didn't take nothing.  You made a sore plan, you will.  You made a sore plan.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:19:30]  All right, Anthony, let's go to Matt.  Matt's going to his prom tonight.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Prom night, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, give us the details.  What high school?  Cardoza High School, Queen.  Right on.  All right, you got yourself a date, obviously.  Yeah, I'm going with my girlfriend.  We'll call her Wendy.  Okay, and your girlfriend of how long?  Not too long, about a month.  About a month, huh?  Yeah.  Have you gotten any action yet?  Minimal.  Have you gotten patch?  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean?  I got to patch last week. 
[01:20:00]  You got to patch?  Yeah, yeah.  You got your hand down her pants?  Yeah.  Now, did you get to patch, or did you go a little further and get to pet the poodle?  I pet the poodle.  Pet the poodle.  Did, let's just say, did, were you able to count all five fingers of your hand while you  did it?  I was not.  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  Okay.  Very good.  Very good.  But no sex?  No, no.  Okay.  I don't think I'll be doing that tonight either way. 
[01:20:30]  What?  Have you patted the canoe driver on the head?  No.  You haven't touched his bald head?  No.  You didn't?  No.  But you just, wait, wait, this isn't making sense.  Well, maybe he doesn't really know what's going on down there.  Do you know where the canoe driver drives the canoe?  No.  Guys, I don't know what you're talking about.  See, I thought so.  I see.  If you're a little older, you're not.  It's the most sensitive of the most intimate area of the woman. 
[01:21:00]  See, we're putting a visual in your head.  There's a canoe, if you know what I mean, and a canoe driver, and he's always at the back  of the boat.  Yes.  Right.  Have you touched him on the head?  I believe I did.  Okay.  Okay, good.  You want that head for good luck, right?  Has she reciprocated by putting her hand in places?  That's the problem.  Uh-oh.  Oh, okay.  She hasn't put her hand down your pants? 
[01:21:30]  No.  All right.  I got it.  Have you grabbed it and tried to shove it down your pants like Bill Cosby did to that  chick that went up to his apartment?  No.  Does that work?  Come here, baby.  Grab my pudding, Papa.  Maybe I should have said, what are we going to do about this?  Well, no.  I don't know.  That's the advice I was going to give all the kids going to their prom tonight.  If she's shy enough not to touch it, I think you may frighten her if you just pull it out.  Now, how far has she gone with you? 
[01:22:00]  Yellow.  Hasn't really done anything.  But you, what was she doing?  You put your hand down her pants.  Yeah.  I did not get the reciprocation.  Any dry humping, as they call it?  Oh, naturally.  Where you get on the couch somewhere and you start rubbing against each other through the  pants?  Naturally.  Boy, that leaves you hurting.  Oh, you don't even laugh.  You get the, what they call blue balls, Opie.  It hurts very much and then you get chasing.  Oh, really?  I had never heard of that one before.  Thank you. 
[01:22:30]  I'm explaining to you.  Hey, wait.  Let me write that down so I can tell everyone what I learned on the show today.  I'm explaining to everybody using you as the person I'm talking to.  Oh, I see.  Okay, Opie.  I learned that in radio school, too.  Put a picture of the person you want to talk to and communicate with.  Put a picture.  In the studio.  If it's a family.  You put a picture of a family that you cut out of a magazine in front of you doing the  radio and that's your audience.  It gives you someone to talk to.  That's what they, shut up.  That's what they, they taught me in college.  I'm like, shut up.  That's great.  I like putting pictures of porn stars up so that way you can talk to them. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  So, so, uh, hmm, you've done that.  Was she into it when you had your hand down there?  Oh, definitely.  She was into it?  Definitely.  Oh, God.  This is a tough nut to crack, Opie.  I understand this because she's kind of really shy.  Obviously a virgin?  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, maybe more liquor.  Roofies.  Roofies.  No, no, no.  Um, does she drink?  Um, we'll find out later today. 
[01:23:30]  I don't think so.  Oh, wow.  That's even tougher.  Yeah.  I have a predicament.  Has she, uh, has she promised anything for the prom?  Actually, she has.  What?  What?  Uh, I should be getting a hummer.  Come on.  Then you're set.  She's, what?  She won't touch it, but she'll do that?  Apparently so.  It's prom night.  How did she, how did she tell you that she was going to do that?  Well, um.  Give me the exact words.  She's a listener of the show.  Yeah.  And, uh, hopefully she's not listening now.  And, uh, I said something to the fact that, um, 
[01:24:00]  Uh, how about, uh, you induct me to the Tuesday Night Hammer Club?  And she says, but I won't see you on Tuesday.  I'll see you on Wednesday.  Oh.  That sort of sounds cryptic, though.  It doesn't mean she's going to do it.  She just said, I'll see you on Wednesday.  That's right.  Well, let's, uh, let's keep our fingers crossed and see what happens tonight.  All right.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to bet you're going to get some action tonight.  Have you, uh, have you been obviously excited in front of her?  Oh, yeah.  Naturally.  And what does she do? 
[01:24:30]  Look at it and go, huh?  No, she just, you know.  Have you, have you, uh, have you, uh, rolled over and, like, shoved it against her leg or something?  No, but maybe I should.  You haven't, you haven't done the spaz moves yet, have you?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's a tough one.  Yeah, I'm going to predict them here, guys.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Where are you guys going after the prom?  Uh, to a club.  To a club?  Do you got hotel rooms or anything like that?  No, then we're going to the beach. 
[01:25:00]  Or, oh, the old beach, yeah.  That's what I'm saying out of your ass.  Yep.  I did the beach thing.  It didn't work too well for me.  That's the problem.  What, like 20, 30 going to the beach?  Yeah, pretty much.  Probably a cap of school.  Right.  You might want to bring, like, a blanket or something.  Doing that, definitely.  Okay.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  This is the hardest advice I've ever had to give.  All right.  I don't know.  I figured you guys would help me if anyone would be able to.  Well, let's, uh, we have someone in the studio that might be able to help you. 
[01:25:30]  Hold on a second.  All right.  Hello, Matt.  Hi, it's Iron Mike Grayson.  Hey, I'm Mike.  I've been with a couple of women that sound similar to your lovely girlfriend.  And, uh, what you've got to do is treat them with patience and tenderness and loving care  and, uh, right hook.  Because once they're in drastic pain, bleeding, and semi-conscious, they become more receptive 
[01:26:00]  to the Louisiana black snake.  So, Iron Mike.  Is that punching the uterus, Iron Mike?  Well, no.  Well, now you're getting carried away, Matt.  First, a couple of light body blows to the beverages.  Use them like a speed bag.  Watch.  I demonstrate on my new hose bag I'm here in the hotel with.  Here, like this.  Shut up!  And then some, uh, light body blows.  Working your way down lovingly. 
[01:26:30]  You know, just start with the face.  And then the body.  And working your way down to the uterus and wind up.  I mean, pull this punch from Mississippi.  And then, wham, right into the uterus.  And then she won't care about something as small as a white man's penis.  Good luck, man.  Thanks, Iron Mike.  Hey, uh, man, a lot of people checking in saying you've got to use the Jay Moore line.  If she's a friend of the show, maybe you can do it, but keep your, like, your pants on.  Oh, for the record, I'm, uh, two for two with what we can do about this. 
[01:27:00]  You are?  Then go three for three.  What the hell?  Who are the lucky guys?  That old gag.  Yeah, try the, what are we going to do about this line?  I don't think that's going to work with her.  Why?  Yeah, she's, uh, she hasn't been listening that long.  Oh, really?  She's not familiar with the Jay Moore episode.  Would you like us to give her a call to see if you're going to get any action?  Hey, we'll help you out.  Uh, that's quite all right.  Damn, why don't people allow us to call their girls anymore?  I'm not that stupid, guys.  Hey, when you go to pin her a corsage on? 
[01:27:30]  Hey, does she have a father?  A what?  A father.  A father.  Yeah.  You got to go pick her up with the mother and father there?  No, we're meeting somewhere.  Oh, you're lucky.  Oh, you are?  Yeah, I've met the parents.  They're cool people.  You're so lucky.  Why don't you go to the house like they do in the movies?  I hate that.  You got to go to the house, and there's the father ushering his little girl out the door  knowing she's probably going to come back limping.  It's like the gazelle, you know, giving their young to the lion. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, man.  You know what the best thing to do is?  You go up to the father before you leave and ask him if he has any condoms.  You got any condoms?  I don't know what this bitch has.  That's a good icebreaker with the pop.  Why?  It works well.  That works, right?  You're sitting there watching TV, you know?  Bonding, watching a little hockey, maybe the Stanley Cup or something, and then you break  out that line, right?  And you break that line out.  Maybe I should ask what a daughter likes to drink. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  Exactly.  All right, Louie.  Louie's a limo driver.  He's seen a bunch of proms.  Oh, that's a good guy, yeah.  He's got some advice for Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Louie, sorry.  Yeah, listen, I'm a limo driver.  I've been doing this for a very long time.  Prom season is nothing, all right?  All this kid has to do is give the limo driver a hundred bucks, limo driver lock the doors,  put the music on, he's done.  Even if he wants condoms, limo driver usually has them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just got to go.  He's got to get over the penisophobia that she's got. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, that's it, man.  Don't be afraid.  Just go for it, you know?  Believe me, everything works out right by the end of the night.  All right.  Thanks a lot, Louie.  All right, Louie.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Matt.  Well, you're on your own.  Let us know what happens tomorrow.  All right.  I'll give you guys a call.  I might be a little not able to call you guys tomorrow, but I'll call Friday.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right.  I'm betting you get some action.  I'll let you guys know.  You got to call up and tell us the truth.  We don't like people lying on us.  I'm a faithful listener.  I've been listening for almost a year, I would not lie.  All right, cool.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  All right, later, guys.  All right.  Hobson, Hobson, do you have any condoms? 
[01:29:30]  I think I'm going to get lucky.  Nothing worse than having to meet the dad.  I like girls without fathers.  Yeah, I swear to God.  I've been lucky with that lately, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With the girls without the dad.  What do you got to deal with?  One, two, three.  My last three girlfriends didn't have fathers.  You take care of my little girl.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry, Pop.  I'll take care of a whack bag, whack bag. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, Pop, does she like the yam bag on the chin or on her ass?  Huh?  You brought her up?  Anthony, I think we got audio of Matt after doing it with his prom date.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, let me go to that right now.  Look what I did to you again.  How did Jamaican Mike get into that limo?  I don't know.  Butt sex.  Oh, really?  Yeah, some butt sex.  Do you think there are people out there that have butt sex on the prom? 
[01:30:30]  Butt, wow.  I mean, that's really making the jump.  You know?  I mean, butt sex at the prom.  When you're at that age for proms and stuff, you're just hoping to get, like, patch or something.  Can you imagine that?  Is there anyone out there that gets, like, butt sex for the prom?  It starts with a gentle kiss on the cheek and a pinning of the corsage at the parents' house and ends with butt sex?  How do you make that jump? 
[01:31:00]  Butt sex.  I don't know, man.  That's quite the jump.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I want to know if Anthony's going to be using these lines when he goes to the prom this year.  We'll see you open.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Shut up.  Where did that come from?  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I usually control the calls a little better than that.  Oh, prom.  Pete, what's up?  Imagine how ridiculous I look at a prom with my scotch or something. 
[01:31:30]  Give me a drink.  You know what?  That's another bit that, like, you know, just those ridiculous DJs do, though.  Yeah.  They go to, like, the prom with one of their listeners or something.  We'll take you to the prom.  One of our lucky listeners is going to be going to the prom with me.  Yeah, that's just.  And that's why, you know, that's another example of really bad morning zoo type radio.  Hey, we'll take you to the prom.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, what's up?  Let's go.  Yeah, I want to tell Matt not to get his hopes up, man, because my prom, I had everything set up. 
[01:32:00]  The girl told me I was going to get lucky, and that's where we coined the term FOC, fear of.  Oh, she had fear of.  All right, we got.  We helped with the limo driver and everything, and I struck out.  $800 later, I ended up with blue balls.  I think most people strike out on the prom, on the prom night.  It's amateur night, man.  It's like New Year's Eve.  Ah, yeah, you know?  Because all the girls are out.  The girls that do it and the girls that don't do it.  That's right.  Instead of going to a bar and spending all that money on liquor, and you can get lucky with some other girls. 
[01:32:30]  And I've got to say it, half the girls that go to the proms, they have those F me dresses on and stuff.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  They don't want to do it.  The dresses have come a long way.  To them, in the pants, it's like this.  Might as well be.  It might as well be.  All right, Pete.  All right, man.  We have a guy that's claiming he got anal at his prom.  There's no way.  You're getting butt-secked at the prom.  Alex.  Hey.  Remember, we don't like liars on this show. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  I swear, but you have to do the trick.  You can't be trying to score with your date.  What?  There's no way.  Everyone strikes out in the prom.  I totally agree with you when you go with your date.  But if you start to fool around with your friend's date, that's when you get laid.  Wait a minute.  You got anal from your friend's date?  We all were friends.  It was like a big group.  My whole crew were friends.  My friend was just going with her as friends.  We were drunk, we got a little friendly, and then we started to take our clothes off 
[01:33:30]  in the bathroom, and she gave me anal in the shower.  Butt-secked.  At least it was in the shower.  She was a, can I say a, W-H-O-R-E on the air here?  Yeah, you can say whore.  There we go.  She was a whore.  She was a good girl.  Jeez.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing wrong.  There's nothing like a good whore.  When you're getting anal on your prom night.  All right, well, thank you, Alex.  There it is, Alex.  At least someone that got, uh, but that's a technicality. 
[01:34:00]  That's a technicality.  Puss-a!  It wasn't his, it was, but, eh, puss-a!  It wasn't his, uh, it wasn't his date.  I'm thinking of my mouth.  Whoa, what are you talking about there?  I don't know what you're talking about there.  Oh.  I can't see making the move in the traditional prom date where you go pick up the date from  the house.  You know, the mother and father are waving with smiles on their, on their faces. 
[01:34:30]  A little tear in their eyes.  The little girl goes off and into the car and drives away on her prom night looking all  night and a few short hours later, we fast forward, backseat, but, eh, I don't see it.  Oh, this poor guy.  This is what I'm dreading someday.  Thank God my wife's not born yet.  That's many years to go.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  All right.  Guys, you're killing me.  Uh, what's the matter?  I got a 15-year-old daughter. 
[01:35:00]  She's going to the prom for the first time Friday night.  Puss-a!  Oh, no.  Are you just freaking?  I'll tell you what.  It's Friday night.  Yeah.  This kid comes to the door.  Yeah.  I'm inviting him in.  Yep.  I'm sitting him down in the living room.  Yep.  I'm going to be cleaning my gun.  That won't matter.  He'll be cleaning his with your daughter later.  Puss-a!  Oh, Anthony, you speak from experience.  It doesn't matter.  I remember going out with this girl, and her father took me aside.  He was driving me home one day. 
[01:35:30]  And he goes, yeah, let me drive you home.  And the girl that I was going out with said, my father wants to have a talk with you.  You know, I'm like, oh, boy, the talk.  You know, God, I hate chicks with fathers.  Now, wait, wait.  Is this the father that used to drop the girl off to your place so he could bang her?  Yeah.  Same girl?  But he didn't know that she was trying to drop the...  It's a hilarious story, though.  You were what, 14, 15?  No, this was like when I was about 16, 17.  All right, but the father would drop his daughter off at your house.  Yes.  Almost every afternoon, right? 
[01:36:00]  No, no, it was the weekends.  Oh, okay.  You know, back at that age, you weren't, like, doing it every day because there just wasn't  a place to do it.  But my mom was working nights on the weekends, so we used to have parties over the house.  So everyone would come over, play poker, and have their respective girlfriends and have  sex with them.  So he would drop her off.  We'd go inside.  And it was just like there was no time.  So we would just run right to the bedroom and do what we did.  And then he would come, pick her up, beep, beep.  All right. 
[01:36:30]  Pick her up.  Like, he's the pimp.  Exactly.  He was the pimp man.  He was doing the same thing that the guys do that drive the chicks around for bachelor  parties.  But before any of this happened, like, she goes, oh, he wants to have a talk with you.  I'm like, okay.  So I hop in his work van.  He's driving me home.  And he's like this real mean-looking guy.  And I'm just like a dopey kid and stuff.  And he's telling me, you know, you're a little older than my daughter.  Because I think I was 17 and she was 15, something like that.  And I'm like, yeah, no, I know. 
[01:37:00]  And he's telling me about, you know, respecting her, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, don't do anything to her because you'll have to answer to me.  And all I'm thinking is, way big, way big.  That's all that was in my head as I'm looking at him.  And he's talking about this because I know what he's talking about.  He's talking about sex.  He's talking about teen sex, Opie.  Teen sex.  Teen sex.  And all I was thinking, and then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hope he can't read my mind.  And I'm trying to block out of my head what I'm thinking because I'm thinking of his new daughter getting banged. 
[01:37:30]  And I'm like, oh, if he can read my mind, I'm dead.  I'm sunk.  And I'm trying to, like, think of a brick wall.  Yeah.  So he can't break through it.  Oh, man.  But, yeah, he used to drop her off.  No, Sean C. from Jersey.  I think you were 33 and she was 12.  No.  No.  That isn't the case.  Thank you very much.  All right, Anthony.  Wow.  I see it on your face.  You're thinking of butt sex, aren't you, with my daughter.  I can read your mind.  Lots of great calls on hold. 
[01:38:00]  If you're on hold, please stay there.  We need all of you guys today, okay?  Also, some girl that wants to meet Psycho Marx on line 10.  A bunch of other people that had anal during their prom.  If you're lying, we don't want to hear from you.  No way.  No way.  If you're lying, please hang out.  You can't make that jump.  Take one for the team and hang up if you're lying because we hate liars on this show.  That's going from sixth grade to college.  There's no way it happens.  You're making a huge jump. 
[01:38:30]  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe now that they've loosened the rules and gay people can take their dates to the prom,  that's the only way you get butt sex.  Yeah, we forgot to talk to the other guy.  We never confirmed that it was a female.  I had anal.  Yeah, me and Bill.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, got a bunch of contestants on the line, Anthony.  Do you want to play black or white?  See if there's any truth to this stereotypical black voice or stereotypical white voice.  Yeah, a lot of people get upset when you say, you sound black on the phone.  Right.  Like, well, what does that mean?  Is there a stereotypical sounding black voice?  And I think we say yes.  Yeah.  No one would mistake me for sounding black, would they? 
[01:39:30]  Uh, no.  No.  But our own black Earl sounds really white.  Still, I could tell.  That he's black?  Yeah.  You could tell.  When he starts getting angry.  All right.  Well, yeah.  All right, so how are we going to play this game?  We got some prizes to give away to anyone that beats us.  All right, we plunk a phone line down.  And then we ask them a couple of questions.  Yeah, the deal is, Ed and I both get two questions, and then we'll guess if you're black or white, okay?  Okay.  We can ask any questions, so that could help as well. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's go to line one.  No, just based on speech.  You can't ask questions about anything else.  This is just based on speech.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Well, then, I want to ask questions.  Yeah, but then it blows the whole thing.  The whole thing is just based on speech.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, now I'm going to bury you.  Why would that blow it?  If I asked this guy his name, why would that blow it?  Because it might be...  A black name?  Shamil or something.  Why is Shamil a black name, Anthony?  It's not. 
[01:40:30]  It's a Jewish name.  So I think if we're going to be fair here, we could just ask him questions.  It doesn't matter.  All right.  You're doing the exact same...  I think it takes away from the validity of the test.  Why?  You're doing the exact same thing I did a little while ago,  saying that I can hear when someone is, you know, black or white.  Yeah, so...  What if I asked this guy his name and he said, you know, Shamil?  Yeah.  Shamil.  Shamil, whatever.  All right.  Then you would think that he would probably be black.  Why?  Because that's a black person's name. 
[01:41:00]  There's white people named Shamil somewhere.  Not many.  I'm sure.  Not many.  It would increase the odds that he would be black.  So are we allowed to ask any questions or not?  No, you could just have them state things.  I wouldn't ask questions.  This is supposed to be just based on the sound of a voice.  Nothing else.  All right.  What the voice is saying doesn't matter.  All right.  Let's start.  Hi.  Who's this?  Sam.  All right.  All right, Sam.  Sam, tell us a little bit about yourself.  I work in Deer Park.  I got a joke for you if you want to hear that. 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  Okay.  What is Brooklyn and a girl in tight jeans haven't come?  What?  Flat bush.  So I'm ready to win.  What's up?  All right.  You got to be honest with us.  I will.  I told Rick.  I'll answer.  All right.  I'm saying this is a black gentleman.  Yeah, you're right.  What gave it away?  I can hear it a little bit in your voice.  Okay.  Very, very, very slight, but I can hear it.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And thanks for being honest. 
[01:42:00]  No problem, bro.  Because we have to take your word on this one.  Okay.  Let's go to a female next.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  What's your name?  I'd rather not say my name.  Oh, you're black.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, you're black.  Yeah.  I didn't want to say it.  No, I can hear it without you saying that.  Wow.  I'll be jumping right on you without a doubt.  Yeah, where do you work?  I'm a student.  A student?  Yeah.  Is that in Puerto Rico right there? 
[01:42:30]  God, no.  I'm just kidding.  This is wrong.  Well, we're two for two, though.  What's your name?  My name's Keisha.  Keisha?  Yeah.  Now, that would have totally given it away.  I know.  That would have given it away right away.  Is this the little Keisha from the Cosby show?  No.  This is Rudy.  Where you been, Rudy?  The Cosby's been looking for you.  I hope you waxed that mustache you had when you were seven.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for playing.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We'll move on to the next one. 
[01:43:00]  She sounded cute.  All right.  Who's this?  This is Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, no.  Don't go jumping.  You got lucky that last time.  No.  Do you want to go to the phones and talk to our listeners about that one?  I just don't want you blurting it out and ruining it for somebody that might be a...  That was a no-brainer.  All right.  Mr. Guy, don't give us your name or anything.  He said Mike.  Oh.  Yeah, that's my name.  Oh, come on.  He's a Spanish guy.  No.  We're playing black or white, though.  If you're not black or white, you've got to hang up. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I know.  And you're not faking your voice or anything, right?  No, man.  That's how I speak.  Yeah, because we don't want people, like, trying to act overly black or overly black.  You're not.  You're a Hispanic.  No, I'm not.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a security guard.  What?  You can't ask me.  There are white security guards.  I know.  I know.  I'm just saying.  I would be willing to say this is a black gentleman.  No. 
[01:44:00]  No.  What are you?  I'm white, man.  You're not white.  No, I am white.  I swear to God.  Listen to your voice.  What's your nationality?  German and French.  Come on.  Where'd you grow up?  Carteret, New Jersey.  Oh, man.  Why do you talk like that?  Because of the people I grew around with.  Yeah, but don't you know it'll hinder your getting a job?  Yeah, I know.  I mean, think about it.  It will.  You know, an employer, look, you can say what you want.  Rick's looking at me horrified. 
[01:44:30]  You can say what you want.  But if you walk into an employer and you sound like that, they are not going to hire you.  They are going to hire somebody who sounds like they can carry on a conversation.  I know.  You want me to join.  Tell hi, guys.  No, not hey, hi, guy.  Hi, guy.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, we lost one so far.  I still don't think that counts.  Why?  He's got that voice thing going.  Well, we got tricked.  Okay.  All right.  We're going to get the chance.  Mike, we're going to give you a prize. 
[01:45:00]  Hold on, all right?  All right.  All right.  Let's go to this one.  Line nine.  Hello?  Line nine.  How are you?  Yes, I'm fine.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  I'm doing well.  And who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  How are you guys doing?  Bingo.  Yeah.  And you tell?  By that last word, I think.  Yeah.  I need a little more time, though.  Oh, gee.  Come on.  Now I'm confused.  Yeah.  Are you driving right now? 
[01:45:30]  No, I'm not.  I'm sitting in my office.  Uh-oh.  Working.  Desk job?  You're sitting by a desk?  Yes.  Yes, I am.  Cleaning it?  My little executive desk.  Yeah.  Are you cleaning it, or are you working at it?  My feet are up on the desk.  Up on the desk, lazy.  That's just...  Oh, my God.  Just saying.  She's not working, obviously.  I'm taking the wrong place.  I don't say anything.  We didn't say what we think she is yet. 
[01:46:00]  When you have your feet on the desk, what does that mean?  Lazy.  That's all I'm saying.  No, she could just be relaxing because she was working very hard.  Who thinks that you're the owner of the place?  Oh, maybe she owns it.  She owns the place.  Okay.  See, don't take it the wrong way.  All right.  Is it a crack house?  No, it's not.  All right.  I was just saying that that you own.  It's a very reputable place.  What kind of car you drive?  Oh, no.  I can't tell you all that.  Then you'll get it.  You'll know.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I'm ready.  Yeah.  I'm ready to commit.  Okay.  We're going to go. 
[01:46:30]  Say it.  Go ahead.  You sure?  Yeah.  Black.  Black.  You guys are good?  We're good?  Yes, you are.  You are a black woman.  And I did not change my voice.  This is my voice.  Yeah, we heard a few little inflections on the name Anthony.  That one tipped Opioff.  Oh, yeah.  Right on.  You know what Anthony did, huh?  Yeah.  That one word got me, but I had to listen a little more.  We should just say, what's the opposite of uncle? 
[01:47:00]  If you hear aunt.  Now, what's your name?  My name is Colleen.  How do you spell it?  Really wacky?  C-A-R.  Oh, okay.  So if I had given you my name, you would have never guessed.  No.  Nah.  Well, thanks for playing.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye-bye.  We're three and one right now.  Three and one.  All right.  Line two, you're on the air.  How you doing?  How you doing?  What's up?  Are you driving?  Yeah, I am.  What road?  FDR.  Ooh, FDR. 
[01:47:30]  Uh-oh.  Heading uptown.  Uh-oh.  Heading uptown.  He's teasing us, though.  Heading uptown on the FDR.  That's...  Yeah.  Well, you've got to talk a little.  All right.  Let's see.  You guys want to hear?  Go through a little of your day today.  All right.  I've got a phone, so that's a quote.  Ah, this is a white guy.  We're right on that one, a white guy?  You just sounded like an idiot.  Rick says we're right on that one.  Four right, one wrong so far.  All right.  Who's on line nine?  Hello?  Yeah, that's you.  Okay.  Don't tell us your name, but...  So what are you doing? 
[01:48:00]  Working.  Working very hard?  Hard enough.  Yeah.  All right.  Where do you work?  At law firm.  Oh, really?  Law firm.  Okay.  Law firm.  Hmm.  What are you wearing right now?  A suit.  A suit?  Yes.  A suit.  Is it multicolored?  No, it's black.  You wearing something around your head?  No.  Is she wearing a black?  I just wanted to know if it was, you know, black suit.  What are you doing tonight? 
[01:48:30]  I'm going home.  Are you wearing any rings right now?  No.  I don't mean on your fingers.  I mean around your neck.  No.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  What?  Why?  She wasn't insulted by that.  That helps.  Let's see.  Stop.  Are you driving home in a little while?  No.  Taking the train?  No.  The police will be bringing you.  Excuse me?  I'm sorry.  I'm making a very bad joke.  How do you get home?  I take an express bus.  Oh, bus. 
[01:49:00]  Bus.  I wish I could hear more of her voice.  I know.  You've got to talk a little bit.  What do you want me to say?  I don't know what to say.  Either you're going to ask me questions or...  How did you say ask?  Uh-oh.  Are you going to ask me questions?  Oh, that was a trip-off right there.  That was a good one right there.  Okay.  Okay.  Can we give you a little test?  Okay.  Uh, when I wake up in the morning, I brush my...  Teeth.  Hmm.  Okay.  All right.  Um, when a woman has a child, it's called giving... 
[01:49:30]  Birth?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh, this is a tough one.  This is a very tough one.  But I think I have an answer.  Which one do you want me to say?  I want to make sure we're in agreement.  Yeah, I'm going to say that, too.  Okay.  Go ahead, Anne.  You are a proud African woman.  Yes.  Yeah!  That was a tough one.  I almost got you guys.  Oh, you're almost...  Almost. 
[01:50:00]  Almost.  Almost.  The word ask.  Yes.  Got me.  I think.  Sometimes I speak very quickly, and it...  You said ask.  No, I said ask.  No, the second time you did, but the first time, I heard it, too.  It tripped the flag right here.  Me and Ope looked at each other and, oh, oh, oh.  No, but usually I'm talking very quickly, so I can sometimes trip up my words.  And what's your name?  Anne Margaret.  Is it really?  Yes.  Anne Margrock.  No.  That's very cool.  Well, thanks for playing.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Wow, Opie, we are five and one. 
[01:50:30]  Five and one.  We only got tripped up once by the guy with the Puerto Rican accent.  Kind of proving what I was saying earlier a little bit, eh.  Let's try another guy.  I don't think this is helping the cause, to tell you the truth, though.  All right.  Line four.  You're on the air.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Oh, no.  What's up?  What's up?  Ask me anything.  Are you locked up?  No, not yet.  No.  Okay.  Just talk a little bit.  I thought I heard a police radio.  All right.  What do you want me to say?  What did you do today?  You woke up and then what?  I woke up about four, came to work. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Security guard.  How do you get to work?  Taxi cab.  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's going to be a problem.  No, it's not.  That says it right now.  I don't know about that.  You wouldn't be able to get a cab.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me ask this question.  You take a cab in every day?  Every day.  How many days have you been late to work in the last three months?  About nine.  Okay.  Good.  Wait a minute.  Are you going?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Which way are you going?  Write it down.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm with Rick on this one.  We're finally split, me and Elkia.  We've been in agreeance the whole time.  Let him talk a little more.  Yeah.  Let him talk a little more.  So, okay.  You wake up.  You brush your...  Thief.  This guy might be messing with us, man.  All right.  What planet do we reside on?  Earth.  This is a white guy.  Shut up.  All right, Cracker. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, oh, Cracker.  You crack ass, Cracker.  I'm from the ghetto.  You're a white man.  You idiot.  We want people that really want to, you know, try to trick us, man.  Hey, I was working for a while.  Yeah, when you sounded normal.  And then you try to be black and you sound more white than ever.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, bye.  See, if he would have just said that, I just thought he was black.  Are we going to take that one or what?  We got it, yeah.  We knew he was white.  You were teetering.  I was teetering.  I can't believe you. 
[01:52:30]  No, I was in agreement at the end.  Then it was obvious that he was trying to screw with us.  Let's try another female.  Hi, who's this?  This is Kim.  Okay.  All right.  Now, that wouldn't be short for Kimba.  You guys are wrecking the game if you're trying to trick us.  Just go along with us, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You working?  Yeah.  Well, not now, but I do work.  All right.  Yeah.  Are you home?  Yeah.  Okay.  What are you going to do tonight?  Go to bed early.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Good work ethic. 
[01:53:00]  That's good.  That's good.  What do you like to do for fun?  I like to go to clubs, I guess.  Listen to music.  Oh, I love.  Yeah.  Listen to music.  All right.  Listen to music.  Yeah.  Puff Daddy, innocent or guilty?  Guilty.  Okay.  Very good.  You're not trying to trick us, right?  No.  All right.  Any other questions, Ann?  I just wanted to talk a little more.  Well?  Like, I don't know.  Yeah.  Is there anything around to read? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  That would be the best.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Magazines.  Playboy.  Sports Illustrated.  Yeah.  Read something out of one of those fine publications.  I have to go and get it?  I need to hear more of your voice.  Well, ask me to repeat something.  How did you say Hoboken?  Hoboken.  Well, I'll tell you where I'm teetering, though.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's take that chance. 
[01:54:00]  You want to?  Yeah.  All right.  And you would be a white woman.  No.  You guys are wrong.  Oh, damn.  You are a black woman.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Kim.  She said Kim.  How black are you?  I'm black.  I mean, I'm not dark as night, but I'm black.  Wow.  Six right, two wrong.  She gets the Robin Quivers award.  Thanks.  Thanks for tricking us, all right?  Thanks.  We got legitimately stumped right there. 
[01:54:30]  Damn.  That just goes to show you.  All right.  You can't tell.  We'll do two more and we'll get out of here, okay?  One out of six times.  You can't tell.  Line A, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Good, good.  I love your show, by the way.  Thank you.  Terrific.  So, what do you want me to say?  I know right away.  You do?  Yeah.  How the heck do you know?  Barry White sounding MRF-er.  Barry White sounding MRF-er.  Listen to those pipes.  Well, that's what I do for a living. 
[01:55:00]  What can I say?  As a matter of fact, I used to work with Black Earl.  Did you?  Yeah.  At the old WNAWA.  Yeah, I mean, he knows who this is.  I thought this was Scotto.  No, this isn't Scotto.  Is this Roscoe?  No.  Who is it?  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Hmm.  Bill.  This is a tough one because he's a radio guy.  Yeah, an old radio guy.  Yeah.  Oh, shoot.  He's going to nail us.  How many Black people work for any W, though?  I think Black Earl is the only one.  You worked on AM? 
[01:55:30]  I worked on AM.  I was on the air at AM.  I was on the air for five years.  Wow.  This is tough.  Five years means he's held the job for five years.  Why, you rat dog?  Oh, look.  You were defended by that remark.  And what do you do now?  I'm a voiceover artist.  Yeah.  Let me see.  I'm saying, I don't know.  All right.  If you're sure, I'll go with that one, too.  I will say you are a black man. 
[01:56:00]  You're darn right.  Yeah.  No!  Yeah.  Hey, you guys are pretty good.  You know what got me?  You can't say that every black man has a deep voice like that, even though I can use him  sounding like James Earl Jones all the time.  Right.  You know what got me, though?  What got you?  You laugh.  You have that, ha, ha, ha, cola nut.  You know?  It's a semi-cold thing.  Get over it, man.  Ha, ha, lemon lime.  Seven-up.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know?  I'll get you, Mr. Bond.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I, Bill, you're a lot of fun, man.  Hey, thank you, guys for having fun.

[02:06:30]  Oh, no, come on.  Yeah, that's great music, honey.  You sound fantastic.  You're going to go far.  Show us your fun band.  Show us your heavy band. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, we're really interested in what you have to say.  Well, let me put the CD back together.  It's Nikki.  What's the name of your band?  Oh, no.  It's called...  What?  Even I and Mike, I guess if it is.  No, what's the name of your band?  This is not fair.  You should let me sing something right now a cappella.  I'll sing a cover of something you like.  A cappella.  Wait.  Something you like.  I am Mike.  Wait, wait.  What do you like?  Wait, I'm trying to spell Acapulco.  Nick?  No, seriously.  Name an artist that you like.  Because I can see you.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:07:30]  Hold on.  That's beat, man.  Hold on.  All right, man.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Listen, listen, Nikki.  Get her some headphones so we can...  And some vagina.  We want to see what the listeners thought of Nikki.  Anthony.  Oh, guys, you've got to get her off the air.  Why?  She's horrible.  First, she's a regular listener.  She knows she has to contribute to the show, and she should show you her top.  Yeah, show us some stuff.  Straight out.  All right.  Because she's pushing her stuff on you, and she's not producing anything for us. 
[02:08:00]  All right, Anthony.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Let's go to Joe and see what Joe thought of Nikki and her band.  Joe, what's up?  Well, I was just curious.  Is she going to show you the roast beef sandwich, or is she going to be singing that Creedmoor  music?  It really is to now, middle America.  Just out of curiosity.  Give her a small hockey helmet and a little yellow bus and kick her out of the studio.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Leave it at you.  Very good.  Let's go to...  Wait a minute.  I agree with her.  Yeah.  I feel we have been insensitive to her and her music. 
[02:08:30]  She has come down here in good faith for us to play her music, and we have treated her  very irrespectfully.  Respectfully?  Irrespectfully.  I made up that word.  All right, very good.  And I want to apologize right after I say, how's your...  Dave, what's going on?  Hey.  Nikki, are you retarded?  What?  What?  What?  I don't understand.  What's so retarded?  Is that alleged music? 
[02:09:00]  Allegedly.  Well...  What's wrong with you girls?  You all come down there.  You say your band is great, and it's horrible.  Well, I kind of dug taggers.  Well, she's all dressed in black.  It's like Johnny Cash with fun bags.  Well, Ann and Mike Tyson and Nikki, so the name of the band is what?  Raise Hell.  All right, I got the CD right here.  I'm not raising much of that right now.  But no, we might actually play it again, so I'm sure Opie's just going to fire it away 
[02:09:30]  in a good spot.  You see?  Yeah.  And warm and cozy and warm.  And the two songs you heard were Kager and the Pimp, right?  Kager's and Pimp, yeah.  Kager's and Pimp, man.  It's just like...  By Raise Hell.  No, Nikki, I'm going to do you a favor.  Oh, no.  Fine, I'm just going to put the CD down.  What's the problem?  I and Mike...  What's the problem?  I and Mike's got a shield design.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  No, you never know when you want to replay Kager's.  Please set your seats to the upright and locked position. 
[02:10:00]  Put away your snack tray.  Mike, Mike, what are you talking about?  And put on your protective goggles.  I'm just going to put the CD down so we can play Kager's tomorrow on our show.  I think we got a radio hit on our hands with Nikki and her band Raise Hell.  Wait, I'm going to make her sing Acapelous.  There she goes.  Oh, man, let's go.  Let me...  And then...  No, Nikki, let me just put the CD down over here, okay?  All right.  All right, ma'am.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[02:10:30]  Let me lift up the newspaper in front of I and Mike.  Okay, proceed.  Oh, it's missing.  Oh.  There we go.  It's fire on the way.  Right next to the Hanson record.  I guess I asked for it, huh?  I'll come down.  Oh, she's going to cry.  No, I...  I should have known.  It's like, it's for a male, middle America. 
[02:11:00]  That's what it is.  Male, middle America.  It's a new game.  Make Nikki cry.  No, Nikki, sit down.  I'm sure you have another copy somewhere.  What's wrong?  I just didn't think...  I mean, I just don't think it was, like, so offensive that you guys kind of, like, freak out.  Can I work you like a hand puppet?  I would like to do that.  I play Punch and Judy.  I'll be Punch. 
[02:11:30]  And your uterus will be Judy.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah, how you doing?  Yeah, what's up?  I think there's a little yellow bus outside waiting for Nikki.  Yeah?  I think his, uh, the vocals were definitely a little weak, man.  The vocals were a little dope?  The sound might have been muffled.  Go to the hockey helmet and show a yellow bus.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  I just want to know, is this a serious band she's got together this Rave Hell? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  You've got to be kidding me.  It's the only label that's going to be listening to that.  There's one on the side of a chunky soup game.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  I hope she's not looking at least.  You've got to whip them out and head down to Privilege, man.  She's smoking, but she looks like she wants to kill someone at this point.  No, it's just, it's funny because I've, I've been on the phone.  Can you want to kiss me?  No, I've been on, I've, I've had, I've had calls from major labels, so I'm a little surprised.  Major labels?  Like the Canva Soup one, that's the guy that's speaking out.  You are so right, Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  How did you guess?  I just signed a contract with Columbia.  I get the first 10 CDs free, and then I have to buy 10 more over three years.  Let's go to Danielle.  Yeah.  Danielle, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I'm a friend of Cowboy Bell's, man.  Oh, cool.  Or Cowbell.  I wanted to tell Nikki that I'm a woman, man, and it sucked.  I'm sorry.  I'm coming from another whore such as you.  Oh, oh, oh.  She ought to, she ought to accept that. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  No, I don't appreciate that, man.  It's male, middle America.  You're going to make me cry.  Male, middle America.  We're in New York.  It's on the East Coast, bitch.  Thank you, Danielle.  The only guy that she knows is Hawaii.  Are you ready to cry?  How about that?  No, I'm listening.  I appreciate the sincere opinion.  It's good to know.  You've got to choke down some Louisiana black snake. 
[02:13:30]  I got something good for your vocal cords.  It's a protein bath.  Put out by Mike Tyson, and it comes in its own pump dispenser.  It's a protein goggle.  How can you guys, like, jump up and down and laugh?  Obviously, Nikki's a little upset here.  No.  Thank God Anthony isn't here, because he'd be sticking up for you.  That's right.  But Iron Mike is a real scumbag, ain't he?  It's like, tell me the picture's great. 
[02:14:00]  We'd be great, and then take pictures.  It's almost like that rape that I allegedly...  You don't know, right?  I've had enough abuse for one night, right?  I don't know.  You tell us.  Yeah.  Guys, wait here.  You can't leave yet.  Wait a minute.  We apologize.  Now, show us cans.  Please?  Wait, wait.  If you show us, like...  Show us your, like...  I'm sorry.  I wish to just...  Okay, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Triangle or Mohawk?  She was stopping. 
[02:14:30]  Holy cow.  She's going to kill someone.  Go follow her.  When are we going to go take puppies?  Well, she's running...  Go...  She's crying.  She's crying, man.  That's not cool.  Get her back here.  Iron Mike made her cry.  No, no.  That's not cool.  Get her back here.  Take a picture.  Get her back.  Rick, grab the cell phone  and see why she's crying.  Run out.  Call us.  Oh, that was mean.  Don't be nasty. 
[02:15:00]  Dude, she's crying, though, man.  Rick, the triangle thing  was the last straw.  Triangle or Mohawk?  I was just inquiring.  Inquire.  I.  Q.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I learned you guys need  to get some security  at the front door.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I'm...  Paul.  Hey, can we get her band  to play tomorrow  at our road show?  There you go.  She want to play  in front of a few thousand people?  I want to hear Kegers live tomorrow.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rick,  try to get her to perform 
[02:15:30]  at our road show tomorrow.  I can't.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  I can't because my drummer...  You're going to make fun of this.  You're going to make fun of this big time.  Why would we make fun of it?  My drummer has...  Was born with only...  This is going to be like that.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  Don't say it yet.  No, my drummer...  People strap in.  No, no.  Strap in now.  If you're driving,  you're car phone over.  No, listen.  My drummer...  Your drummer...  Wait, let me guess.  My drummer's sick.  I'll just leave it at that.  No, wait a minute.  No, he was born with what?  Born with what?  Come on. 
[02:16:00]  Only part of his pancreas.  You can play drums with our pancreas.  Well, no, he's...  The Def Leppard guy can play one arm.  I think you're...  No, no, he's very sick.  Like, as in, like, seriously.  Can you do a transplant?  I'll tear yours out.  Through your ass.  I thought I came back for, like, some easy...  Hey, Ralph on line three wants us to play track three, Meat Carton.  God damn it.  Okay. 
[02:16:30]  Why did she come back?  They begged me to come back.  They said they wouldn't bother me anymore.  I know.  We just didn't want to...  This is like a third-grade playground, Missy.  We just didn't want to see you leave and cry, Nikki.  No, I'm not crying.  Okay.  I'm not crying.  Because we were playing Make Nikki Cry, and then we accomplished that, and now we want to...  So you want to play?  No.  You're in a band.  You've got to have a pancreas.  It's not going to roll back sometime in the future.  You play or not?  I know.  I think the voice has potential.  He's really...  I just think the lyrics are a little too simple, Nikki. 
[02:17:00]  Well, all right.  What's the matter?  His body is not producing adequate insulin due to each half a pancreas.  Look.  Iron Mike, can I speak?  Iron Mike is smart.  Can I speak, Mike?  Now, sure.  Listen.  Listen.  Oh.  Why did they...  Why?  You can't win.  I have a good horn.  Nikki, I'm sorry, but Mike Tyson's hung over, too.  He's a little...  All right.  He's a little sterling.  You know, party last night.  The first stuff we were doing was really edgy and really different, and they said it was 
[02:17:30]  too alternative because the people that I actually was speaking to told me to go more  straightforward.  Right.  So I did.  How much to suck it?  Good night, Iron Mike.  You must sleep really well at night.  Oh.  On my Rockaway bed.  Bed.  Oh, come on.  I'm sorry.  Come back.  All right.  She just slammed the door again.  Rick.  Get her back.  I love you.  You can let this go, huh?  Rick, just tell her we're going to...  We're going to pause. 
[02:18:00]  I apologize.  Yaddle doodle.  It's the grease man.  All right.  Rick is talking to her.  She's like, no, man.  I'm done.  Get her back in here.  She's like a retarded yo-yo.  Keep coming back.  All right.  Rick's talking to her at the end of the hall.  We're going to see if she goes for it.  She's talking.  This is probably the meanest thing we've ever done.  This is worse than when Opie told the old lady her friend was dead.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  I think Rick's going to talk her into coming back. 
[02:18:30]  Wait.  Rick's going to call that from down the hall, I think.  Just tell him to put him on hold.  Put him through.  All right.  All right.  We're going to get her on the phone is what they're saying.  All right.  I'm not here to commit...  No, no, no.  I'm in suicide.  I'm trying to get signed.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know.  Here, close that so we don't have to hear that.  But I mean, come on.  I mean, you got to...  Please don't make fun of me.  No, no, no.  Please don't make fun of me.  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[02:19:00]  I won't say that at all.  I win.  Who actually did it?  Don't worry.  I won't say that at all.  All right?  You want to just go back in and...  That will apologize?  Yeah.  Can I swear?  Okay.  Look, you're trying.  You want some tissue or something?  Come on.  Come over here.  We'll get you.  The topsy, Kirby, love the rock and roll.  All right, listen.  She's coming back.  I can't be a part of this, man.  I've never been told anything like this in my life. 
[02:19:30]  I've been on...  Oh, no.  Oh, this is awful.  I came here.  I thought it would be funny.  I'm stupid.  I asked for this, but I know the way to show.  I understand.  Oh, no, I feel bad.  Want to hold your gloves?  Yes.  This one is good.  What is she...  Oh, Rick's giving her toilet paper to wipe her eyes.  Oh, you know, this is just bad. 
[02:20:00]  This isn't funny anymore.  She's only calling up because they want to shock everybody and do the...  She's like, corky.  You can come out with the new comment.  What did I miss?  I've been away.  What happened?  All right, yeah.  We've got to get out of here.  This went horribly wrong once again.  Aw, what's happening?  Is she crying?  No, you're not a joke.  That's terrible.  How about we, like, invite her in and make believe it was a play and we all, like... 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  We all take a shower.  Invite her back in.  Invite her back in.  Get her back in.  We're ready for her.  Everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  It's like...  Tell her it's like candid camera.  Right.  Tell her it's like candid camera.  We took our kid to campus and made the girl cry just for the fun of it.  Aren't we awful?  I'm serious.  Oh, she's having a nervous breakdown now.  You know what everybody else says?  This is a...  I'm telling you, I've been on scholarship for everything.  Wow.  I've been in shows. 
[02:21:00]  I've been on...  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  She's losing her mind.  I'm nobody and I'm open talk.  I know I'm not a nobody yet.  All right.  She's getting herself together.  All right.  Get herself together.  Get her in here.  We got to make nice.  We got to make nice before we go off the air.  We definitely do.  Even our faithful listeners will string us up for this one.  Yeah, they're kind of pissed.  I don't blame them.  All right.  I didn't mean to make her cry.  That iron mic is a prick. 
[02:21:30]  We'll be nice.  I can't...  If they're not nice to you, we'll...  All right, Ed.  Where is Rex?  She's right out there.  Just drag her in.  Oh, God.  And why don't you go down the hall there?  Come on in.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Listen, you don't understand.  I really have been on the phone with Major by getting famous.  I really have been on scholarship smaller.  You have to come in.  You got to go in.  Just drag her in.  I'm talking to you, I got to go in. 
[02:22:00]  Look, is Mike going?  Is Mike going?  Is Mike going?  Let's close the show on an up note.  Come on.  How are you going to do this?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  We're not.  Look, come on.  Take it.  Come on.  Come on.  Look, take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  Look, I'm stupid.  I thought it was a good stand.  All right, all right.  Come on.  All right, Ant.  Come on in here.  Come on in.  We'll be nice.  I swear. 
[02:22:30]  Come on.  We'll be nice.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on.  All right.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  Nikki, everyone.  Nikki, you okay now?  You know what it was like?  It was like a play.  No, no, you know what it is?  It was like a candid camera.  We were doing a play.  This was like a candid camera.  The mean bastard was played by Anthony.  And I really feel like...  And the compassionate one was played by Opie.  It's just some...  See, look.  Look.  Mike Tyson isn't here anymore.  Everything's nice.  Now, take a few deep breaths.  No one laugh.  Now, come on.  Take a few deep breaths. 
[02:23:00]  It's like callers call in.  You know, they want to say something funny.  Do you listen to the show?  I do listen to the show.  I know it's a very vicious show.  You know how it works.  Well, sometimes it is.  Sometimes it's nice.  It goes both ways.  I've honestly been on scholarships.  I've honestly been on the show.  Okay.  I've honestly been on the phone with record executives.  Thank God I didn't say anybody's name.  I know that I'm like an open target here.  And everybody thinks I'm lying.  No, you know something?  It was very mean of all of us guys to gang up on a girl. 
[02:23:30]  It was a stupid stunt for me.  It was a dumb idea.  No, it's okay.  You're very brave to come in here and take this abuse.  And at this point, Nikki, I must say, you're a survivor.  Oh, man, that's...  You're a survivor.  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Nikki, a true survivor.  Oh, God.  You're doing well for me.  No, no, I'm playing you a song. 
[02:24:00]  You're a musician.  I'm playing the flute for you.  Isn't that good?  Sounds like the Titanic song.  Nikki, lift your head up.  No.  And be proud.  Come on.  Be proud.  Lift your head up.  Nikki, Nikki.  I see a smile.  I see a smile.  I see a smile.  I see a little smile.  She's smiling.  Come on.  Kooky, kooky, koo. 
[02:24:30]  That's what the show is about.  It's retarded.  We're ridiculous.  You just described the show.  Ridiculous, okay?  All right.  Well, we want to thank...  Plug your band.  We want to thank Nikki for coming by.  Where's your band going to be playing at, Nikki?  We're not going to be playing out until the spring  because you have to replace our drummer.  Okay.  But when we do, we'll probably be playing out...  So should we try to help you find a drummer  that has a full pancreas?  Would that be nice?  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Now, Nikki, do they need two arms to drum?  Yeah.  Would you go for a one-armed drummer with a...  I'll let Def Leppard.  No, no amputees, okay?  No?  Now, Nikki, one-armed drummer with a full pancreas,  would you go for that?  No.  Okay.  Now, would you, after you get a drummer,  agree to maybe come to one of our live shows  and perform in front of thousands of people?  Festival crowd.  Definitely.  Definitely.  If you don't want straight stuff,  we have, like, stuff that was...  Gay?  Oh, straight.  Two alternatives.  I was honestly told to do very straightforward rock, 
[02:25:30]  and I also like...  I mean, I like everything.  I listen to all kinds of people.  Okay.  Well, let's hear it for Nikki.  We've got to end the show.  Nikki, good sport.  Nikki.  Thank you.  Wow, this was really bad today, didn't it?  Oh, man.  Sorry, Nikki.  All right, Nikki.  Well, have a nice night, okay?  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:26:00]  There's nothing being said.  Trust me, there's nothing being said.  Nothing being said.  There's nothing being said.  We want to say, but...  We're not saying anything.  No, no, no.  Not saying anything.  Nope.  The Enola Gay rolling down the top half.  No, no, no, no.  No, we're not going to say anything, Nikki.  We apologize.  Nikki, hold your head up high.  Come on.  There you go.  Let's see Nikki's pretty face.  Lift your head up.  Come on.  There you go.  Come on.  Coochie, coochie, coochie.  It's Rupert.  Oh, come on.  She's laughing now.  There she goes.  There you go.  Nikki, can I have my watch back? 
[02:26:30]  Well...  Yeah, why did you give her your watch?  Because I said if we were mean, she could smash it.  All right.  As I walk out, I'll give it to you.  No, give it to the watch.  No, I'll give it to her because I don't want any more like laughing.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  That's fair.  Okay.  That's fair, right?  Oh, that's fair, man.  That's real fair, man.  I apologize.  I swear I apologize.  Not allegedly.  Allegedly.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Go-ya. 
[02:27:00]  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Go-ya.  1027 WNEW.  Well, we got some sad news.  This whole Reagan story is just getting more and more tragic every day.  It's pretty interesting.  Every couple of months, he's back in the news.  And, boy, they just haven't found that cure where he's perfect and fine again.  No, and they're not going to.  It's just a matter of time at this point.  Well, Alzheimer's disease has robbed Ronald Reagan of his ability to speak. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, he can't even talk now?  Now he can't even talk.  He's just slowly but surely deteriorating.  And now he has lost his voice, the ex-president of the United States.  But he can still smile.  Oh, great.  Okay, let me get this straight.  He goes from finger on the button, power to destroy all mankind.  That's when I was in high school.  Yeah.  To it's an accomplishment that he's smiling.  Right.  Right.  Life rules.  I try to visit every couple of weeks, and we found he likes my bright red fingernails, Reagan's oldest daughter, Maureen says. 
[02:28:00]  Great.  He writes that in this week's Newsweek.  He looks at those nails, and we get a big smile from the man.  A big smile.  Right.  That's great.  Well, anyway, it's our lucky day once again.  I don't know how he's going to speak because the Alzheimer's has robbed the ex-president of his ability to speak.  Yeah, supposedly he can't even speak, huh?  So, I mean, how are we even going to do this phone call? 
[02:28:30]  Ah, I hear he's on line five right now.  Mr. Reagan.  Mr. Reagan.  Hey, Mr. Reagan, are you there?  Hello.  There he is.  Hello.  Hey, they said you can't speak.  Yes, I'm sorry.  The phone was ringing, and I answered the cat.  Now, that'll hurt.  No, no.  Old Ron can still talk.  Well, the papers are saying you cannot speak anymore because of the Alzheimer's. 
[02:29:00]  No, I just want to say I can still talk.  I choose not to, so I don't have to talk to that big-headed stick figure, Nancy.  God damn it.  She's about the scariest friggin' thing to look at, isn't she?  That's so wrong.  A head like a cassava melon on a body only Karen Carpenter could want.  God damn it. 
[02:29:30]  Thank God for Alzheimer's.  Sometimes I forget I even banged the broad.  Hey, I'm a little leprechaun, and I'm on Jupiter.  Hello?  Yeah, where are you at?  Yes, Mr. Gorbachev.  Yeah.  Tear off those clothes.  I always hated that damn spot on his head.  He'd be talking missiles and ICBMs, and I'd be like, Jesus Christ, it's shaped like Nancy's big fat ass. 
[02:30:00]  Mr. Gorbachev, wash your head, you wooski.  Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black.  I ate my cufflinks, and I'm a foghorn.  Woo, woo, woo.  Hello?  Yeah, we're here.  Hello?  Yeah, we're here, Mr. Reagan.  Uh-oh.  What's up?  Here comes Nancy.  I'd better start drooling, or I may have to stick it to that praying mantis balloon head bitch. 
[02:30:30]  You know, sometimes I wake up screaming, just screaming.  Yeah.  I dream her huge head is calling me and wants sex.  God damn, I'd rather...  Ugh.  I wouldn't do her with bonzo sloth.  Oh, my God.  My ice cream's melting.  Yeah?  Yes, and it's all warm.  Yeah?  And it's in the back of my pants.  And it stinks.  And chocolate. 
[02:31:00]  I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  Here's my handle, and, well, my spout is soft all the time.  Look, my hands are on backwards.  Once Barbara Bush hobbed my knob.  Oh, yeah?  What?  She hobbed your knob?  Who?  Barbara Bush.  She did?  Yeah.  That's what you just told us.  Who?  You.  I should watch that whole gag.  You.  I love Alzheimer's. 
[02:31:30]  I don't have to be responsible for anything.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, what's wrong?  Here comes that friggin' Maureen.  Yeah?  That daughter of mine with those goddamn nails.  Well, it says in the paper you really like her red nails.  Why would they think that?  I don't know.  That's what she said, I guess.  Oh, the reason I'm smiling is because I remember banging 20-year-old Hollywood starlets with nails like that.  I miss that hose bag. 
[02:32:00]  Well, she used to tickle my prostate with those nails.  Oh, yeah?  Now my prostate looks like a pineapple.  Oh, wow.  As does Nancy's big head.  Excuse me, could you do something?  Yeah, what?  I'll send the Secret Service away.  Yeah.  Shoot me.  Come on.  Would you please shoot me?  It can't be that bad.  I'm sitting in my own crap.  Yeah.  And Nancy's huge head keeps baking it on me like some distorted Mardi Gras float. 
[02:32:30]  I was going to say, does it still look like a Pez dispenser?  It's still.  Oh, my God.  What?  It's awful.  And if she thinks I can talk, she tries to have sex with me.  Well.  Do you have to go down below there?  Oh, my God.  The only thing more horrible than her head is that gas.  You should see it. 
[02:33:00]  It's like nothing I've ever seen.  Well, what does it look like?  The horror.  Yeah.  The horror.  Yeah.  It's just this empty, cavernous, dried-out hole.  Oh, man.  Nothing.  A void.  A vacuum.  Oh, here she comes.  Yeah, keep walking, Twiggy.  Well, what does the gas look like, though? 
[02:33:30]  Is she nice and trim down there?  You're a glutton for punishment.  Why?  Trim, who could tell?  It's all gone white.  Falling out.  She's bald down there.  Oh, yeah?  And to top it off, she's got that stain that Gorby had.  God.  It's all just a mess.  I'd rather not talk about it.  Okay.  Because, well, I didn't write any material on it.  You said you were, you know, going in that direction.  Perhaps, well, I'd have an answer. 
[02:34:00]  Well, I figured you were flowing that you might be able to go there, Mr. Reagan.  No, I'm not flowing.  No, I...  Neither is she.  I'm very dry.  All right.  I can't even do this Ron impression with the short throat I am.  No, that sounds fine.  You ask.  Yes.  Okay.  Do you have any other jokes, Mr. Reagan?  Let me look.  Okay.  It's all out of one.  That's about it, huh?  Yes.  All right.  I'd better go now.  Okay. 
[02:34:30]  Godspeed.  Carry down that wall.  All right.  There he is, everyone.  What?  No, there he goes.  The ex-president of the United States of America, Mr. Reagan.  President Reagan, everyone.  Today, you're stuck with the words of O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  We're talking about King Gimp.  We just saw the automatic door scene.  My God.  Oh.  He's trying to get through an automatic door, and it opens up, but he can't get through it 
[02:35:00]  before it closes again.  And he's, like, up against it and just totally freaking out.  Flailing.  Arms and legs are flailing his head.  Oh.  Rob from Jersey.  If he couldn't stay in his chair at the Oscars because he was happy, can you imagine what  he would look like rubbing one out?  He would be flying around the room with his junk in his hand like a fire hose going full  blast with no one holding it. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  And everyone's talking about the popcorn scene.  They're queuing that one up for us, where he eats popcorn off the floor.  But it's time to play the King Gimp game, Ant.  Yeah.  Very easy game.  We're going to give you a King Gimp quote.  An actual quote lifted from the tape in King Gimp's own voice.  And he's actually saying something.  Yes.  We were going to have it where you just had to guess what he said.  Yeah.  But it would be impossible.  It would be impossible. 
[02:36:00]  So we will give you multiple choice.  Correct, Anthony.  Sounds like it's easy, doesn't it?  Yes.  And we got some great prizes today.  Can we give all this stuff away?  Anything we got?

We have plenty of stuff to give away.  I don't care.  I'll play.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  East Northwest.  Are you enjoying the King Gimp game?  Oh, yeah.  That's all that matters. 
[02:42:30]  Even better watching it.  All right.  We're going to play the clip.  Listen closely.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay, whoa. 
[02:43:00]  That's actual audio from King Gimp that was on HBO last night.  I don't know.  Don't worry.  We'll give you the multiple choice.  You have to figure out what King Gimp is saying, all right?  Did King Gimp say, A, they wanted to kill me when I was born,  but I was bouncing so much the doctor couldn't catch me?  B. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  I got something in my throat.  So, B, they wanted my mother to put me in an institution,  but she would never give me up.  Or C, did King Gimp say, my father didn't want me,  so he moved to L.A. and married a stripper?  B.  Of course it's King G.  Oh, my God.  I would have bet $1,000 that you would have gotten it.  You would have had to be King Gimp to miss that one. 
[02:44:00]  All right, let's play the clip.  Of course he said they wanted to kill me when I was born,  but I was bouncing so much the doctors couldn't catch me?  That's not what he said, Ed.  He said they wanted my mother to put me in an institution,  but she would never give me up.  Here it is.  One more touch.  Oh, I heard institution there. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  James, you've got a good ear for this.  Thanks.  The best quote is still to come, though, guys.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  All right.  All right, we've got a prize for you.  Hold on a line, okay?  All right, thanks.  Stinky and Spaz will take care of you, so hold on.  All right.  Our own King Gimp, Spaz. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, Spaz looks like King Gimp.  If he would grow that beard.  Dye black, he is King Gimp.  All right, we're going to move on to number four here.  Okay.  Andrew.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  You want to play King Gimp?  Hell, yeah.  This one's a little tougher.  I've got to give Rick that much.  All right, this one's tough?  A little tougher.  All right, Andrew, listen closely.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Sorry.  Like, you have to pick which one.  You're going to play the same one over and over. 
[02:45:30]  I know.  All right, here's the one you have to listen to.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I have no clue, guys. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, we've got to give you multiple choice.  Yeah, I said, Andrew.  Here we go.  Did King Gimp say, A, no one could understand that I was an intelligent person inside of this body?  B, everyone can laugh all they want.  I am smart and have a hot body.  C, nobody understands that I am not crazy.  I am King Gimp.  Um, A. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, wow, another winner.  No one has lost this game yet.  I'm amazed.  You guys could read King Gimp.  We have a lot in common.  You guys speak King Gimp, I would say.  Okay.  I can tell Rick he's an a-hole.  Those answers are too easy.  All right, Andrew, hold on the line.  You've got a prize, too, coming to you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Later.  All right, line four.  Andrew has won the King Gimp game, Anthony. 
[02:47:00]  You want to continue?  Uh, yeah, first of all, I got these, uh, the new ones, the new answers here.  Yeah.  Um, but he hasn't written down which are the real ones.  Right.  But without even hearing the clip, I want to slowly read through it and see if I can guess  which ones Rick wrote.  Okay.  Listen to the clip.  I...  Are you insane?  What?  He's making me laugh today.  I got it.  Okay. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  He's definitely making me laugh.  I'm saying before I even thought this one.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good, Anthony.  Debbie, you want to play the King Gimp game?  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Merrick.  We might as well just give everyone the prizes.  I know.  All right.  Merrick.  All right.  Listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what he's saying, okay?  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[02:48:00]  Are they choking on something?  That sounds like the week in review.  Yeah.  Oh, my. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Let's see how good you are at...  I'll be the first person to lose, I'm sure.  Did King Gimp say, A, she is a beautiful girl who I would love to sleep with, but I don't  think she likes me that way.  B, she has changed for the better because she isn't as uptight as she used to be.  Or C, this chick is such a hot piece of ass, I would love to TF her, but I'd probably take  your eye out.  I'll go with B. 
[02:49:00]  Of course it's B.  God damn, Rick.  Unbelievable.  Are we running out of prizes, Ben?  Are we running out of prizes?  Stop.  Unbelievable.  We've given out everything.  It took us months to get these prizes, and we're giving them away.  All right, well, hold back some of the stuff.  I'll only give them, like, three choices or something, all right? 
[02:49:30]  All right, Debbie, hold on the line.  What?  Okay.  I just read six.  What, Ed?  What's wrong?  I thought you were making it tougher, Rick.  Well, the six is a little rougher, all right?  E.J.  What's going on, guys?  All right, you ready?  I am ready.  Okay.  Listen for the quote. 
[02:50:00]  What?  I was trying to follow line by line, and I couldn't.  Are any of these right?  Yeah, all right, come on.  Of course.  All right, E.J.  Don't be the first to lose.  Okay, let's see what you got for me. 
[02:50:30]  Did King Gimp say, A, sometimes when I'm alone, I cry because I'm not able to be normal, but what can I do?  B, sometimes it does get lonely, but I don't really think about it much.  Or C, someday I will be able to have a family of retards of my own, or C, someday I will be able to have a family of retards of my own that I can make fun of, too.  We're all going to hell.  Jesus, Rick.  I'm going to guess B on this one.  You're going to guess B.  Yes.  We have another winner, it looks like. 
[02:51:00]  Now I just want to play to see if we go A for A.  A and B were both pretty good answers, though.  Yes.  At least it wasn't dead giveaway like TFing her and poking her eye out.  Yeah, that's great.  The humor of Rick.  We're enjoying the humor of Rick today.  Comedy style of Rick.  Of Rick, our producer.  All right, EJ, hold on the line.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You have won the King Gimp game, too.  Awesome.  Ron playing along at home on the instant feedback.  No, he didn't say conductor.  When do we reach close first? 
[02:51:30]  Matt, why don't you have the callers try to guess just one word that the Gimp is saying without multiple choices?  John from Hoboken, I love your show.  Listen religiously every day, but I have to say the King Gimp segment is truly tasteless and not funny.  Making fun of someone because of his medical condition they have no control over is completely heartless.  King Gimp has done an amazing job of leading a rather normal life, rather normal life, given his severe medical condition.  It's not funny.  Wow.  Anyway, back to the King Gimp game. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  One hour.  Come on.  I dare you to turn off the radio.  I think King Gimp's saying, cue down.  That's racist.  Ben Stein, Vernon, New Jersey.  All right, Ant, let's see if we can keep the record alive here.  Six out of six people have won the King Gimp game.  What's easier to understand?  King Gimp or a dice when he calls in? 
[02:52:30]  I think King Gimp makes more sense.  I'm over here now.  Yeah.  All right, we have the next King Gimp clip, Anthony.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, I'm sorry.  That's not the King Gimp.  Wait, here we go.  King Gimp, everyone.  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  Come on.  Be serious.  I have it.  I have it. 
[02:53:00]  Here it is.  You got it, Ant?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on!  No, I believe I have the next King Gimp quote, Anthony.  I'm over here now.  You must be mistaken, because I obviously have it over here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Come on.  All right, Ant, stop fooling around.  We got people that want to play the King Gimp game?  Yes.  All right.  Here's the next quote.  Let us know what King Gimp is saying. 
[02:53:30]  Okay, brother.  How did I get in there?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Come on now.  Have we run out of clips?  I don't know.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones and play the King Gimp game.  Okay.  Here's the next clip.  Can we see your stuff?  Easy.  Hey, Russ.  What's up, R1A?  What's up?  You having fun listening to the King Gimp game today? 
[02:54:00]  Bro, I almost got in a full car crash.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Don't be the first one to lose the King Gimp game.  Yeah.  On my luck, I probably will.  All right.  Listen closely to the following quote from King Gimp.  That was on HBO last night.  And you just have to tell us what King Gimp is saying here.  Here it is.  I have to feel amazing that women, human, speak to me. 
[02:54:30]  Okay.  I have to feel amazing.  I have to be amazing.  I have to feel amazing.  I have to feel amazing.  I can't believe.  I can't believe I can believe I can believe.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  That's what I was just about to say.  Okay.  Horrific.  All right.  Russ, is King Gimp saying A?  A, I had two people try and take advantage of me, but I have some friends who said, F that S. 
[02:55:00]  B, I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking, F this S.  C, if the two professors tried to use me as a science experiment again, I was going to bust the cap in their ass, F that S.  Or D, we're adding even more answers to make it a little tougher, Anthony.  If those two professors had their way, I would not have been allowed in school, F that S.  Russ, what did King Gimp say? 
[02:55:30]  I'm going to go with A, guys.  A?  Yeah.  No, you are our first loser, Russ.  King Gimp did not say, I had two people try and take advantage of me, but I have some friends who said, F that S.  What King Gimp was saying is, I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking, F this S. Here it is.  I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me. 
[02:56:00]  I, I, I, I said, I, I, did, I, did, I, did, you, did, I, did, you.  Wow, we just had a Kim Kirsten on our radio show.  I had no idea when we first played that clip.  The only word you can recognize is the S word of that. 
[02:56:30]  Light FM checking in, Anthony.  Hello, we would be interested in hiring King Gimp for our next Light FM commercial  and possibly DJing for us as well.  Instead of a Valerie Smalldone, you could have King Gimp on Light FM?  Let me tell you something.  No talk.  No, you have him talk.  Let me tell you something.  You want ratings.  If you hired King Gimp to do a show opposite us, we would listen.  Imagine that.  We would blow off our show to listen to that every day.  A talk show?  Or music?  Would he be a music jock?  No, a music jock. 
[02:57:00]  So he talks a couple times now.  All right, we have one more contestant for King Gimp.  Yeah.  Thank God.  All right.  Ben from Suffering, New York.  I guess John the Dump Guy doesn't know King Gimp-ish either.  No.  Thank God.  Wayne from Tarrytown.  This is not actually King Gimp.  Who is it?  A, Tom Brokenjaw.  B, Spaz.  C, Christopher Reeves.  Or D, Bob Hope.  All right.  Dennis. 
[02:57:30]  Dennis, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  You want to play the King Gimp game?  Of course you do.  Absolutely.  And you've been having fun checking this game out today?  Yeah.  I think the Knicks found a new center.  All right.  All right.  Listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what King Gimp is saying.  Very easy.  Here we go.  Oh. 
[02:58:00]  Oh.  What?  Why are you laughing?  It's very obvious what he said.  What was that?  Was that Spaz's value-dictorian speech?  All right.  Dennis, here we go.  The King Gimp say, A, everyone loves a person who fights to preserve, but only I am the Gimp.  B, persevere.  I'm sorry.  Everyone loves a person who fights to persevere, but only I am the Gimp. 
[02:58:30]  B, everyone has a handicap, but the way they deal with it is how you win.  C, everyone has a handicap, but only a few are the Gimp.  Or D, everyone has a handicap, but Jesus Christ, I'm really effed up.  This blows.  Someone please, I've got to get laid.  I've got to say D just for the hell of it. 
[02:59:00]  What the hell?  We'll give you a prize.  No, we don't care.  We don't care.  Dennis, you lost, but you won.  All right, cool.  King Gimp said, Everyone has a handicap, but only a few are true Gimps.  All right.  You sure that wasn't Patrick Ewing in between the third and fourth quarter the other night? 
[02:59:30]  Well, Dennis, you're a winner, too.  What the hell?  All righty.  All right.  Hold my line, and thanks for playing the King Gimp game.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  John checking in.  I think King Gimp said, Yo, B, I didn't steal no Corona.  That's happening.  Give me that.  Bogey and Anthony.  I've got to do that. 
[03:00:00]  This is debauchery mania.  I've got to do that.  Prostate exam for everyone.  I've got to do that.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-M-E-W.  Thank you. </pre>
