<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's scandals, focusing on his crack cocaine use and a physical altercation with a city council member.  The hosts dissected a CNN interview where Ford defensively blamed the media, and analyzed a video of the incident with the councilwoman, speculating on its intentionality.  This segment was punctuated by frequent expletives and crude jokes.  The conversation transitioned to George Zimmerman, analyzing 911 calls involving him and his girlfriend, debating the credibility of their accounts and speculating on Zimmerman's behavior and financial situation;  the call itself was played. This discussion also utilized explicit language and commentary on Zimmerman's appearance and actions.  One host then shared a lengthy, digressive anecdote about travel problems, including an expensive last-minute flight and an unconventional airport limo ride, further fueling tangents about apps, Canadian geography, a Buffalo Bills fan's stadium fall, and a Patriots game outcome.

The show continued with further analysis of the George Zimmerman 911 call, including his arrest. This was followed by a discussion of planned apologies and the day's guest list: video vixen Bobby Jean Brown and actor Stacey Keach, with brief mentions of promoting "Orgasm Wars" and Sam Roberts' return to the show amidst technical difficulties.  A significant portion critiqued MSNBC and its personalities,  alleging double standards in handling offensive statements from left-leaning versus right-leaning commentators, citing examples like Reverend Al Sharpton, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Bashir's apology to Sarah Palin.  This segment featured extensive profanity and strong opinions.

The interview with Bobby Jean Brown, author of "Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip,"  followed.  Brown discussed her past meth addiction stemming from her breakup with Tommy Lee and his subsequent marriage to Pamela Anderson. She detailed her abusive relationship with Lee, including a revenge-motivated press conference revealing Lee and Anderson's honeymoon hotel room number.  She recounted sexual encounters with Leonardo DiCaprio and a period of "hate fucking" followed by celibacy.  Brown also mentioned her appearances on "XYZ Rock" and negative Twitter reactions, concluding that she and Lee have since reconciled.  

This was followed by an interview with Stacey Keach.  Keach recounted his 1984 Heathrow Airport cocaine bust, his six-month prison sentence, and his work as the prison librarian. He discussed his career, including roles in "Mike Hammer" and "American Greed,"  and anecdotes about working with Bill Blatty on "The Ninth Configuration."  Both interviews contained explicit language and descriptions of sexual encounters and drug use.

Keach's interview continued with a discussion of voiceover work, public apologies, and the role of context in interpreting controversial statements, citing Alec Baldwin and Miami Dolphins incidents. He shared his opinions on political correctness and the lack of contextual understanding. The conversation then shifted to Rob Ford, Keach's acting roles (including *Planes*), his experiences during the JFK assassination, and anecdotes about working with Bruce Dern and portraying Nixon.  The hosts then expressed anger at their management over a canceled 20th-anniversary event, discussing their podcast and their frustration with their agent's perceived greed.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Rob Ford's television show and the hosts' upcoming podcast episodes featuring Mike Tyson, alongside a discussion of Google Glass.

The show then included a Hulu Plus advertisement, followed by further discussion of the jeopardized 20th-anniversary event and the possibility of the hosts leaving the show.  This led to an in-studio interview with David Blaine, promoting his magic special "Real or Magic." Blaine discussed his career, the years spent filming celebrities for the special (including Woody Allen, Kanye West, Katy Perry, and George W. Bush), his challenging stunts, and his superstitious nature.  The conversation returned to the hostsâ€™ discussions of the new Xbox One, video games (particularly Grand Theft Auto), and listener calls regarding the Xbox One, David Blaine's magic, and the management conflict.  The show concluded with promotional reads and further discussion about the potential cancellation of the "big event" and its ramifications, mentioning a scar David Blaine showed Ant from a magic trick gone wrong.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang open-handed, don't listen to dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, morning everyone. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, hi.  Mm-hmm.  Hi there.  Mm-hmm.  Ah, water.  Mm-hmm.  Water tastes good.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's good to be home.  You know, when you leave New York City, there's no vegetables.  People don't eat vegetables, I've noticed.  Really?  They just don't.  Meat and potatoes? 
[00:01:30]  Meat and potatoes.  Sundae sauce.  Ah.  Just a lot of meat products.  A lot of meat?  A lot of meat.  A lot of beer.  A lot of wine.  Wine?  I was on Brother Weez's show yesterday.  I have to ask you this.  I've been thinking about it.  You drink wine, right?  Oh, yeah.  Now, I don't know if this is a Brother Weez thing, a Rochester thing, or a drinking thing.  But he says there's a new trend where people put shots of tequila in their wine. 
[00:02:00]  Have you heard of this, sir?  That must be a trend for the northern New York people.  All right.  Okay.  I, uh, no.  He's telling me this and looking at me like I'm crazy for not knowing this.  I'm like, I've never heard of people putting shots of tequila in their wine, but supposedly  it's taken off in some kind of trendy thing.  Yeah, I, uh.  You get the really nice, you know, tequila.  Yeah, I can't say that I've heard that.  Okay.  At all.  All right. 
[00:02:30]  All right.  Not even as a passing fancy.  Okay, good.  All right.  You've never seen or heard of it?  Can say never.  Okay, good.  All right.  Sounds like it would taste awful.  Absolutely.  Wine itself will do, uh, you know, some damage and give you a nice hangover.  And I enjoy, uh, a good bottle of wine these days.  If I'm drinking wine, it's gotta be a pretty good bottle.  Right.  Uh, the thought of pouring tequila into it.  Yeah.  Just a shot.  Yeah.  It's gotta be the good stuff.  It doesn't matter, a shot or waving the bottle over the top of the glass. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Like, tequila and wine just.  The combo sounds horrendous.  It sounds like it would taste like it tastes when it's coming up.  Yeah.  Like, you're drinking wine and tequila all night.  Right.  And vomited.  Yeah.  That taste in your mouth.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, good.  Because, uh, I don't want that one taken off.  Because I do, like, a good glass of wine every once in a while.  I don't think it's gonna.  All right.  Now I gotta fuckin' write him and say he's full of shit. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Well, maybe it's spreading southward.  Slowly but surely.  Is it some fuckin' Canadian thing that crossed over the border?  I don't know.  Like a plague?  I have no idea.  Yeah?  I want to thank United for getting me fuckin' home, though.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah?  I guess that wind shit was pretty bad, huh?  Uh, yeah, it was a little windy.  Oh, you were probably on a smaller plane from Rochester.  No.  Well, what?  The tornadoes in the Midwest.  Oh, well.  And then the wind was bad in Buffalo and Rochester, but no tornadoes.  And then my plane, I was on Delta, had maintenance problems all day long. 
[00:04:00]  And then I finally said, there's no way this plane is flying.  And I went over to the United desk, and they completely hooked me up.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That never happens.  No.  Oh, God, no.  Once you're fucked at the airport, you're fucked.  Yeah, they don't give a fuck.  It's like, uh, you get lucky sometimes.  Right.  I just heard a little announcement from the United, because it's such a tiny airport.  Every carrier is right next to each other.  Mm.  And I hear, we still got seats available for, uh, United leaving in 15 minutes for Newark? 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, what?  They must have known Delta had a problem.  Right.  So they probably, uh, they were probably saying that for any Delta people who were fucked.  So I run over there, I go, huh?  It was him.  Yeah.  I run over there, I go, how much is the ticket?  She goes, I don't know, about $350, $360.  I'm like, all right, I'll get back to you, because then I run over to Delta to see if  they could do a little something, something for me.  A little switcheroo.  And then he gives me a number to call, so maybe I could get my money back on the ticket  I had.  I'm like, oh, Jesus, I'll just eat this ticket.  So then I go back, and I go, all right, I'll take a ticket to Newark, and, uh, the guy 
[00:05:00]  goes, that'll be $660.  Oh, nice.  It's a 40-minute flight.  $660.  That'll be $660.  And I'm thinking, they know with this wind shit, you know, and maintenance problems and all  that, that people are going to be desperate at any moment.  So I think they went for the hikeroo.  I just said, I'll have two pickets to Titsburg.  Chip likes it.  And then something, then something really strange happened. 
[00:05:30]  Someone behind the counter actually helped me.  Whoa.  Because you don't get help anymore.  Wow.  They actually helped me.  I go, all right, I'll take the ticket, because I've got to get home, and, uh, I'm going to  eat this Delta ticket.  And he goes, well, they should have just transferred you to our airline.  I'm like, well, they didn't.  And then I look over to the Delta counter, and there's no one there, because that guy's  hiding.  Oh, yeah.  They go away.  Went to the Tizzy.  They go away.  Because it looks like a lot of those people were there for hours instead of checking their 
[00:06:00]  flight to see where they're at.  Uh-huh.  I'm all about checking that flight, because if they fucking delay it, then you don't have  to go to that airport and sit there forever.  It's all about the apps now.  You just fucking log on.  You can check your flight time and everything.  You just check on an app?  Uh, yeah.  My app is called Club Soda Kenny.  It's an amazing app that everyone should have.  I like the apps.  They're pretty accurate, man.  Yeah.  You get a good one.  I like getting the ones you've got to pay for, you know, because then I feel like they're  a little more accurate.  More accurate than the Club Soda Kenny app?  Are you kidding me?  No, no.  The Club Soda Kenny is the best app ever. 
[00:06:30]  It's amazing, and it comes in a text message.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, but then you try to delete it, and it won't get off the phone.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't know if a moronic ostrich is available for the iPhone yet.  Right.  So then this guy, I go, I, you know, we both look toward the Delta counter, and the guy's  gone, you know, he's just making believe he has things to do, because they were, like  I said, they were in a bit of a tizzy.  He hunkered down somewhere.  And leaning toward an uproar over there. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And I don't think any of those other people heard the announcement, because, I mean, New  York airports, they're all right here.  Yeah.  So if, why, if, I must have, you know, connecting flights, but I don't know.  So then he goes, oh, well, let me, let me try to make a phone call.  He makes a phone call.  Long story short, he fucking, he gets it done for me.  Nice.  He saved me $660, because it would have been the $660 plus the $240 or whatever the original  flight was.  Righteous.  For 40 minutes in the air. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  $660 from Rochester.  Right.  And then, then I went illegal from Newark to Manhattan.  I went illegal.  What, one of the clowns?  Yeah, but the guy goes, oh, I got a limo, it'll be less than a taxi.  I go, all right, because I was in a cab line, there was about a hundred of us, no exaggeration,  not pumping it up.  And it was rush hour, so the taxis were just trickling in, one or two, every once in a while.  Oh, man.  And I started doing, I started doing the math, but I'm going to be on this line at least 
[00:08:00]  an hour.  Yeah.  So all the, the, the shady guy, remember the shady guys from the old days we used to  talk about, where they're on the posters?  You need a ride.  But they dress like the posters.  Why would you dress like the posters if the warning's out?  I guess so you know that they're them.  Oh, you think that's, yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah, that's the shady cab guy.  But he knows what he's doing, because he was right near a stairwell, and I was right next  to the stairwell on the curb.  Hey.  He comes up, he goes, and he just kind of walks down the line, anyone need a ride to Manhattan?  I go, I fucking do.  I don't give a fuck if you're a serial killer. 
[00:08:30]  I'm going to take the chance.  What airline?  Oh, Newark.  From Newark to Manhattan.  And then he oversells it.  He says, you know, I got a limo, and I'm like, I don't give a fuck.  Okay, dude, I'm taking it.  Don't worry.  But, you know, I got in his really shitty, mini-vanished car.  Limo.  But he got me to the city, man.  He knows all the fucking tricks.  Yeah?  How much?  Was he making moves?  75 plus tip.  I ended up throwing him 100.  I'm like, dude, thank you so much. 
[00:09:00]  He made amazing moves.  Yeah, good moves.  He's like, when you're in the tunnel, first of all, never take the left lane.  You've got to go right lane constantly.  And then as we're going on the helix, but we cut down, you know the shortcut?  Underneath.  Underneath?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Do you know the one-way right turn trick yet?  No.  There's a one-way.  He took that?  He goes, I don't need to today because it's clear.  Even though the helix was way, this is way too fucking inside for everybody.  I'm sorry.  It's when you wrap under the helix, and you're coming, you're kind of coming up on a little 
[00:09:30]  tight oval.  Yeah.  And instead of taking the oval, you make that little first right, and you jump in against  it.  It's a one-way.  You've got to go against the one-way, but it's a one-way for like 20 feet.  That's it.  You got a ticket there.  Yeah, but he explained where all the cops are.  I got a speeding ticket coming up into there once.  Really?  Yeah, fuckers.  Those guys will watch that.  But he goes, here's your first move.  He taught me all sorts of shit.  Here's your first move.  He goes, the cops, usually, if they're going to get you there, they are right there, but sometimes  they go across the street because they know some of these people take it. 
[00:10:00]  But if you take that sharp right on a one-way, you're right at the toll booths.  Oh, man.  But he goes, I don't have to do that today because it was clear sailing, even though the  helix was completely backed up because most people don't understand the undercut.  Go under.  They don't understand that move.  And then he goes, okay, now Lincoln Tunnel, never left lane because the bus is back up in  the left lane, especially during rush hour.  So sure enough, we're in the right lane just flying as the left lane is at a standstill.  Yeah.  And then he told me a few other tricks that'll probably bore the fuck out of the people. 
[00:10:30]  But he goes, and I was thinking about you because he goes, and sometimes, you know,  sometimes you just got to use a curb.  Well, you do.  And the sidewalk.  You know what happens when you pop out of the, yeah, I know it's local, but when you  pop out of the tunnel in Manhattan, you can't take the normal way where everybody else  goes.  The left?  Yeah.  Right.  You got to pop a right and sometimes you got to go over the median.  Right.  Yeah.  And then you're done.  It's beautiful.  Oh, God.  Smooth sailing.  This guy was amazing.  He was awesome.  And that's how he makes his living. 
[00:11:00]  He does the, you know, the illegals.  You know?  Yeah.  I support, but I support until there's a really long fucking line and no cabs coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you got to do what you got to do.  Then you got to, yeah.  Now you got to make some moves.  So anyway, Rob Ford is in the news again.  Greatest guy ever.  Well, this guy, wow.  It's almost like he's doing it on purpose now.  There's no one better than Rob Ford.  Yeah.  He's hilarious. 
[00:11:30]  It's almost like he's doing it on purpose.  His mouth should be called a gold factory.  It's beautiful.  I guess they stripped him of all his duties now, huh?  Duty.  He's got a few duties that he still has, right?  What was the vote?  They went around it and got something.  Oh, yeah.  They just stripped him of all his power as his mayor.  They knocked his budget down 60%.  I know that.  So what is he going to do with the other 40%?  That's what I'm thinking.  Craig.  He might do some crazy shit with that 40%.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  It's 36 to 5.  36 to 5. 
[00:12:00]  Well, you know his brother voted for him.  Yeah.  His brother.  I mean, he probably voted for himself.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  So that's two.  So who are the other three?  Cool people?  Exactly.  The only cool people in the whole place.  Why wouldn't you want to keep him?  Not the woman he knocked down.  I bet she didn't vote for him.  That was so...  I know.  They made it sound like he's, you know, charging at her.  Yeah.  I read, like, when I first saw that story, it was Rob Ford barrels over city council members. 
[00:12:30]  I saw it on Twitter, and I'm like, okay, now I've got to see the video.  And he obviously...  He's saying that his brother was in some kind of confrontation somewhere else, so he ran all the way around to maybe help out his brother and bumped into this old broad, but he didn't, A, do it on purpose, and, B, he realized immediately what was going on and kind of held it from completely falling.  He was kind of laughing.  She was even smiling, and he was kind of like, all right, you move this way, I'll go this way.  Right.  You know, he's kind of rotund, it's hard to get around people when you're that big. 
[00:13:00]  I laughed out loud watching that alone, that video, so I saw the link, and I was just like, what a big, fat klutz.  He's a clod.  He's clodding into people.  He's a bull in a china shop.  Oh, he's a mess, dude.  He's not dainty whatsoever.  No.  Yeah, so we've got some angry speech going on.  But she's right away going, it's okay, it's okay. 
[00:13:30]  You can see, she's patting his chest like, I know that was a mistake.  He ran at her and grabbed her.  No, he didn't run at her.  No, he didn't.  Oh, God.  Fucking.  I don't believe you.  There's enough gold with this guy.  You don't got to make shit up or exaggerate stuff.  He didn't run, he was running beyond her, and she's, he grabbed her to make sure she didn't  fall down.  Yeah.  He's trying to get around her.  Now he's holding her up because he realized he knocked into her.  And he's looking beyond her.  But saying sorry to her, and she patted him on the chest. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Sorry, Tori.  Grabbed her.  What a, what a dummy.  Yeah, they're just dishonest.  The news is just dishonest.  That's not what happened.  He's a big fat guy and he ran into her.  That's what stopped him, his process, his progress, because he realized he ran into a lady and  he went back.  He grabbed her because she was falling down.  Yeah, he stopped.  And she had the hairdo like Frank Vincent, like the fucking old lady who got beat up.  Frank Vincent. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That's classic.  And then he was doing a little Kuwait comparison.  He's brilliant.  He's brilliant.  Yeah.  Mediate.  It's two minutes.  So we can just listen to it.  Oh, yeah.  Two minutes.  Rob Ford is not long enough.  The crack smoking mayor.  The opposition.  I want people to listen to me tonight from eight to nine on Sun News.  He's plugging. 
[00:15:00]  They're all laughing.  He's killing.  You will get my side of the story.  Okay.  Unfiltered.  This, folks, reminds me of when I was watching with my brother when Saddam attacked Kuwait.  And President Bush said, I warn you, I warn you, I warn you, do not. 
[00:15:30]  Well, folks, if you think American style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait.  And you will never.  Size-wise, he's not wrong.  Can't you ever see something that you have marked my words, friends?  Uh-oh.  This is going to be outright war in the next election.  And I'm going to do everything in my power.  Hey, Mayor Ford.  Your time's up.  Everything in my power to beat you guys. 
[00:16:00]  Thank you, Mayor Ford.  And most of the way you're doing to me is taking me out of my office.  He turned his mic off.  And the worst thing that you can do, I was elected by the people.  Mayor Ford.  You're absolutely right on that.  Because every one of you guys have sinned.  Mayor Ford, your time's up.  And it is absolutely the worst thing you can do for democracy.  Thank you.  In the city of Trump.  Thank you.  When the crowd comes around, friends, remember what I'm saying. 
[00:16:30]  Now, they stripped him of most of his powers, but why?  Because they say they can't take him out of office unless there's a criminal complaint.  By the way, where's that hour, Rob Ford, where's that hour on Sun News?  Yeah, really.  Oh, we're cutting it up right now.  Yeah, we're going to have some Rob Ford clips from his TV show, hopefully, in the next half hour or so.  But why are they allowed to strip him of his powers if he wasn't?  It's probably a technicality.  Yeah, they found some way to.  They voted on something that they probably never would have considered. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Because they can't remove him, but they can probably do this, this, and this, which blocks his path everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They look through so many legal books and stuff.  But there's no criminal complaint.  Yeah.  So that's why they probably can't just boot him.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  I mean, here he'd be out.  I think here the press is a lot worse here, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They would eat him alive.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're doing a number on him in the American news anyway.  I wonder if he came out and said, look, I need, it may be too far now, but if he came out and said, I need help, if he tried to get a rehab help or do something, would that stop the process or would that just sink him? 
[00:17:30]  Well, they're saying he's getting help.  Well, they're saying he's getting help.  Tough.  Tough.  But it's so obvious he's not.  Yeah.  Right.  He's just like, ah, I'm going to stop drinking.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, obviously, I think it's tough for him to keep his job, but I'm wondering how they're  allowed to do that.  What if you're a candidate and you do have, like, a, you know, a past like him?  Let's say he wasn't the mayor yet when all this went down, but the people elected him anyway. 
[00:18:00]  Like, how does that work out?  How does that work in Canada?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, I think it's in the past people, you know, ah, but when he was mayor and that videotape,  just kill him.  No, it's brutal.  It's fucking brutal.  He's just running into a fat lady now.  It's like, no.  Oh, yes.  I won't eat your pussy.  I've got enough.  He's done nothing to make his case better.  Every time he speaks, it's worse.  And every day, it's a new one.  Yeah, yeah.  Every freaking day.  That's fucking great.  Absolutely.  He's a wonderful man.  I love him. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, he's so entertaining.  Big fatso.  How was his interview on, who had him last night, CNN?  Had to sit down with him?  Yeah.  He loves it.  He loves it.  And then he was at one of the fucking, the games, one of the...  Oh, my God.  They told him to stay away, too.  Yeah, no, he's not staying away.  And he's in the stands.  He's fucking, he's got the jersey on.  He's hooping and hollering.  Rooting on his team.  Taking pictures with people.  He's the mayor.  Signing things.  You see the lady from the other team with the sign that said, our mayor is better or something 
[00:19:00]  like that?  Right in his face.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that was fun.  He does love the attention.  I just don't...  Oh, does he love the attention?  I just don't know the CFL.  What is it?  The Argonauts.  Oh, boy.  Uh, I know there's a stampede.  Argonauts.  Uh, I don't know.  That's about all I know up there.  Gophers.  You have attacked Kuwait.  Yeah.  Right.  What?  Nice analogy.  Oh, he's so great.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  There it is.  Our mayor is better than your mayor.  Right in front of Rob Ford.  She's right there.  It was against the Hamilton Tiger Cats.  The Hamilton Tiger Cats.  Never heard of them before.  We should know this shit.  We're broadcasting to Canada these days.  Yeah.  We're parts of it.  I don't know.  How far into Canada do we get?  Toronto.  Montreal.  That's about it?  Yeah.  You don't think we're weighing the boonies?  What, like Calgary? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  They're there.  Canada almost...  The Yukon.  Canada almost looks like the United States after, like, an Ice Age.  I like it.  Yeah, that's an Ice Age version of the U.S.  It's so weird.  It almost looks like us.  It's just kind of as much as far across.  Right.  Just doesn't have those pesky southern states, it looks like.  Looks like the U.S. with all the southern states taken out of it.  Like, it's got that big area where the Great Lakes would be.  Right.  Yeah.  And then California is just a lot... 
[00:20:30]  They have their own, like, weird Great Lakes area.  Yeah, yeah.  Over there, they've got the northeast, they've got the wacky west.  That looks like California right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little fatter and shorter.  Just squished.  Squished from an Ice Age.  Yeah.  Sure.  And, like, they cut off the bottom of, like, Texas and Florida and Arkansas and Louisiana.  All that shit is gone.  Yeah, you've got to just slice that shit.  Yeah, they cut that shit off.  Because maybe an earthquake or something.  Well, I think the glaciers just kind of pulled it and ripped it away. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Right.  That's funny.  Canada does it.  I always thought that.  Like, it's kind of similar.  Did you guys, speaking of football, did you see the video of the guy in Buffalo?  Oh, the guy that fell off the fucking...  Riding the rail?  Yeah.  A dummy.  What a crazy fucking thing to do.  That's a drunken thing to do.  He's trying to fucking ride the, like, how you slide down a stairway banister. 
[00:21:30]  Well, I...  He's riding the fucking whole mezzanine section banister down.  I forgot until I saw that video.  I went to a lot of Buffalo Bills games when I was living in western New York.  Because when the weather got cold, management didn't want the tickets anymore.  So, us poor people said, fuck that.  I don't give a fuck.  It's, like, single digits.  We'll go to the games.  And I forgot.  But that stadium was set up in a way where people would do that all the time.  It's fucking nuts.  But I've never seen anyone on the outside do it.  Just usually in the middle of the stadium, you would slide all the way down. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, not on an end where you could fall off.  No, man.  That's just crazy.  That's pretty stupid.  It's on Deadspin if you haven't seen it.  I'm sure most people have.  This is a day old, which is an eternity in this world.  Well, people don't realize that.  A week later, they send me fucking links to shit.  I'm like, are you serious?  Oh.  Anthony, you gotta do this.  It's creepy.  You see it in the background.  Oh, there he is.  Yeah.  Because they're doing a setup shot.  Wow.  Wow.  And then he just tumbles down.  And then he fell on some guy's head. 
[00:22:30]  And he's dead?  No.  No, the guy, that guy is completely fine because he was wasted.  Because, you know, when your body's, when you're all fucked up, you're very relaxed.  So I think it prevents you from getting some serious injuries.  Who thinks that's a good idea?  Well, he was sliding down the rail.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  Like I said, I remember that people used to do that all the time all over the stadium.  But I've never seen it on an outside rail on the upper decks.  Yeah, you wind up falling on somebody.  Yeah, that guy is more injured.  He held on for literally one second. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  That is crazy.  But then he did a complete flip.  He's lucky he didn't break his neck or fucking die.  Yep.  He's just sliding.  We, what a dumb fuck.  One Mississippi ball.  You asshole.  Wow.  I don't even think the broadcast picked it up right away.  No.  Because it was just an establishing shot after a commercial.  Yeah.  Dummy.  Fucking drunks at the stadium. 
[00:23:30]  Patriots lost last night.  He sure did.  They had one shot at it at the end there.  And Brady threw the interception.  Controversial.  Controversial.  You think?  There was a flag on the play.  And then they said, ah.  Krakowski wasn't going to catch that ball, though.  Uncatchable.  It was uncatchable, right?  Yeah.  That's what he said.  I guess Brady went up and fucking called him an asshole or something.  The, what?  The, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta.  Well, you gotta with that.  Of course you gotta.  Drop the old left.  Oh, I didn't hear this.  Fag.  They did throw the flag, though. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  The game is over.  Oh, boy.  Oh, they shut the mic up. 
[00:24:30]  Go home and fuck a model.  What do you say?  That's fucking what?  Brutal?  Brutal?  Yeah.  Something like that, right?  Oh, he's a competitor, man.  He didn't like the call.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm thinking sensitivity training.  An apology, I think, is necessary.  Why is that a big story?  Of course people are dropping F-bombs.  It's just Deadspin posts everything.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, no, it's really good.  Okay, all right.  Well, I think he should be banned from football.  I think so.  What of the children? 
[00:25:00]  What of the children?  We forgot to talk about Rob Ford imitating a drunk driver, too.  Oh, yeah.  They're playing on CNN right now.  And then here he is running around and grabs the lady to make sure she doesn't fall down.  We'll report that accurately.  Oh, boy.  He's so animated.  Take a look.  Wow, from the outside, it seems like you are a man under tremendous burdens this week. 
[00:25:30]  How has it been?  How has this week been for you?  It's all self-inflicted, you know?  It's my fault.  I made mistakes.  You own up to it, you move on.  And so, in his very next breath, Rob Ford moves on.  I went down to City Hall.  I've cleaned it up.  These people just aren't happy.  These counselors want me out.  The media wants me out.  I told the chief of police I want efficiencies, you know?  Obviously, he wants me out.  I'm not going anywhere. 
[00:26:00]  The setting for this interview is more than a little surreal.  This is the rec room of a suburban Toronto housing project.  And it is filled with loyal and vocal members of Ford Nation.  Things start relatively sedate.  But when I ask why he decided to admit his crack use after months of denial, he gets so angry he forgets who's in the room.  I just had enough.  I was sick and tired of all these allegations and all this bull****, excuse my words.  And that's all it is.  Sorry, kids.  I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids.  But after all, I know what I'm doing is right. 
[00:26:30]  I'm serving the people.  I'm saving taxpayers money.  And you know what?  I made mistakes.  I drank too much.  I smoked some crack sometimes.  How do we find ourselves in the middle of a Rob Ford rant in the middle of the projects?  Interesting story.  It actually started on AC360 Friday night.  After some give and take with the mayor's counselor brother, Doug, we were about to say goodbye when he floated an offer.  And we look forward to having you by Toronto one day.  I'll take you up on that.  And 18 hours later, I found myself unloading toys from Doug Ford's SUV outside the Queensplate housing projects in the heart of their war. 
[00:27:00]  But as we wait for the mayor, Doug's unscripted style of public relation takes a turn when a long-time resident named Ken wanders over to complain about a threatened eviction and a run-in with the cops.  And as the counselor politely tries to nudge him to the door, he says this.  I know a lot of friends that bought hash from you, actually.  Okay, well, that's good.  Because he has been fighting those allegations since May when the Toronto Globe and Mail dug into the Ford family's checkered past 
[00:27:30]  and reported that Doug spent much of the 80s as a mid-level hashish dealer.  That's the first time I've heard the allegations that your youth is shoo-shoo a little hat.  Oh, boy.  No, I wasn't slinging any hash.  I said it very clearly 30 years ago, 31 years ago.  I smoked marijuana.  And I didn't deal with marijuana.  In downtown Toronto, Mayor Rob Ford is the target of almost daily protests. 
[00:28:00]  Boy, it has to go!  Worst mayor ever.  He's the council floor of City Hall.  He is a political pariah.  Shane!  Shane!  Have you purchased illegal drugs in the last two years?  Yes, I have.  That's the bottom line.  And that's the bottom line!  His brother invited us here to witness this love, a counterweight to the gauntlet of political foes downtown,  doing all they can to strip away his power to lead.  I'm interested in what happened this week about the vote.  It was 41 to 2 to strip you of your emergency powers. 
[00:28:30]  From the outside, that seems like you guys are political outcasts.  Okay, sure, because I'm like, you know how you want to make friends at City Hall?  Just keep spending their money.  Spend taxpayers' money.  Let them go on their free trips.  Let them have their free food.  Let them do whatever they want.  Do what you want with your money, not with taxpayers' money.  Then turn around and cry, poor.  Do you have any political allies left?  Well...  Did you ever have any?  No, we never had any in the beginning.  We have the power of the people.  Well, I'll tell you one thing. 
[00:29:00]  I'll work day in and day out to knock these counselors off.  I'm going to target their areas and work day in and day out to knock them off.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to bring Ford Nation live just all right across the city.  Ford Nation.  So you have other candidates that you are going to foster in these wards to try to repeat what you guys have done?  100%.  Really?  Yeah.  We're going to hit them hard.  Everything we got.  We make Chicago politics look like a tea party.  We do.  It's vicious.  Bill, you show me one other major city.  I've saved a billion dollars that has turned it around like I have. 
[00:29:30]  Our roads are getting done now.  It's clean.  It's safe.  The crime's down.  Things are happening.  We have more cranes in the sky.  We have more jobs.  We created over 50,000 jobs in one year last year.  But take all of that.  Given you all of that.  Couldn't you be even more effective if you're a little healthier in your lifestyle?  I'm trying to lose some weight.  I'm working out.  It doesn't mean like that.  I'm going to see some addiction specialists.  Just to make sure.  I'm not an addict.  Bill Weir.  CNN Toronto.  He is really belligerent. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, wow.  It is a bit of a laugh or cry moment, I think you have to say.  Because you don't really know what to make about it.  It's a laugh or laugh.  It's just laugh.  All laughs.  Is that his term ends next year and they've stripped him of all of his powers, basically.  It's going to be a long year, though.  I mean, think about it.  The thing I do wonder is what changes will be made if they can or if they will implement  any changes to way.  All right.  And then it gets boring.  That's fucking great, man.  That's where we tap out.  And then it gets boring.  God, he's great.  His clothes are fantastical.  Wonderful.  But they had to go to the worst place possible to find supporters. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just go to the fucking slums.  That was a horrible place.  I shouldn't, you know, use that language in front of the children.  Curse in front of the children.  What will he do today?  Yes.  It's a daily thing with him.  Who was saying this was kind of like Sheehan?  Yeah.  Travis.  Oh, Charlie Sheehan.  Yeah.  Are you getting sick of this?  A little bit.  I can see myself in a couple of days being like, all right, winning. 
[00:31:00]  I think this is way more real than Charlie Sheehan.  Sure, yeah.  It's a lot.  It's very real.  But now it's like, oh, what are you doing again?  Charlie Sheehan, it started out real, and then he kind of really played into it.  This guy, I think, just can't help himself.  I don't know.  I mean, telling city council that if you want my side of the story, you can tune into my  new show.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  And Charlie Sheehan, just, you know, kind of the actor gone nuts kind of a thing.  This guy's, you know, a politician.  He's supposed to be running a city. 
[00:31:30]  And you know what?  From everything that I hear, he is.  I mean, I don't hear anything about how bad he's doing, you know, running the city.  That's true.  They can't attack him on his record.  So apparently he must be doing well or they would have thrown that at him.  Well, they can't attack you on your crack use.  That's true.  That is true.  Your crack use.  Your admitted crack use.  That's a rough one.  We're getting ready to accept pot, finally, after all these years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think crack is a bit down the road still.  You think that's a...  Yeah, when you hear that word, you just, whoa, instantly go, all right, this guy has 
[00:32:00]  a major problem.  We need a few years of weed before we even start looking at crack.  At least a few.  Let's give it ten.  Casual crack use.  And then maybe we'll start accepting it.  Well, you've got to accept it as medical crack use first.  First, right.  You know, for glaucoma.  For medicinal purposes.  Yeah, yeah.  I need this for my medicinal purposes.  It makes me feel better on the chemo.  Right.  If I just smoke a lot of crack. 
[00:32:30]  It helps my glaucoma.  Yeah.  And my achy joints.  Yeah, yeah.  I've got fibromyalgia, so I've got to smoke some crack.  How does that come?  I've never seen medical marijuana.  Does it come in a pill?  I think it does come in, like, a pill bottle.  It does?  And, uh, yeah.  All rolled up and shit?  Little buds in there.  Yeah, yeah.  There's, like, doobies.  Little joints.  Really?  Medical marijuana.  Yeah, like that.  Marijuana.  Yeah, like a bud. 
[00:33:00]  Some buds in there.  So do people go there one time, get the medical shit, and then replace it with the good shit?  The really good shit?  Mm-hmm.  And how do you do that?  I don't know.  Are they using, um, some kind of, like, wrapping paper?  At the dispensaries now, it's, you know.  Yeah.  Fucking, you just go in there, and it's like a showcase of weed, I guess.  Nice.  I don't know.  I've never been.  But, uh, from what I hear, it's pretty good.  And good weed, I guess.  So what's, uh, what's happening with your boy, uh, George Zimmerman? 
[00:33:30]  Ah, George.  You're pals with the family there.  Oh, boy.  Well, uh, apparently his, um, he had a little living girlfriend situation going on.  A new one?  Yeah.  He's cute, too.  Because, uh, yeah.  Did you see the picture?  I haven't seen a picture of it yet.  Oh, dude.  Apparently.  Wait, was she in the paper today?  He's going through, uh, you know, that divorce thing with his wife.  Right.  Who was, uh, with him during the trial and everything.  Right.  Uh, and, you know, that's, that's not, uh, his girlfriend. 
[00:34:00]  What was her name again?  I already forgot her name.  Sean.  Uh, God.  I don't know.  She's a big girl.  I forgot her name already.  Yeah.  Ratchet.  Ratchet.  Rachel.  Rachel Ratchet.  Chantel.  Chantel.  Yeah, yeah.  The new girl's name is Samantha something.  Samantha.  Rachel Chantel was the big fat witness.  So they're living together in her house?  They're living together, I guess, in her house. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Um, and, uh, she called 911 and says, uh, this guy's going crazy.  He's busting up my shit.  He, uh, pointed a gun at me.  And, um, that's her?  Yeah, that's her.  Wow, all right.  Big set of fucking tits.  Yeah, she's got big hooters on her.  Look at her big fucking tits.  Okay, I see what's going on here.  All right, now.  Nice big heavy hooters.  Yeah, so, um.  Oh, okay. 
[00:35:00]  Let's suckle those.  All right.  So, uh, yeah, she, she calls 911.  She starts screaming, um, that, uh, he's busting up her shit.  Uh, the cops show up.  Uh, and that's when George went inside the house, because apparently he threw her out  of the house to get out.  And her story is, hey, I told him to get out.  She doesn't want to be with him anymore.  She told the cops she was pregnant.  Um, I don't know whether that's true or not.  Uh, it's not true.  It's not true.  She told the cops she was.  I don't know why she'd do that. 
[00:35:30]  But, um, and, and during that time, the cops were like knocking on the door and George  wasn't letting him in.  And then George decides, I better call the cops, too.  So he calls 911.  And, uh, he goes, yeah, well, the police are here.  And she goes, well, the 911 upper is like, well, if the police are here, you know, what  do you call 911 for?  He just likes to call 911, this guy.  And he said, well, enough with 911.  I know, we get it.  You know, three buttons.  He goes, he goes, I want my story out there.  Okay. 
[00:36:00]  So he then, yeah, the truth.  So he then starts telling, uh, this other story about how she, um, she was busting up  the shit and that his gun was in a locked case and, uh, all that.  But isn't she the second woman to say that he pointed a gun or pulled a gun?  Uh, his, his wife, uh, his estranged wife said that.  And now his new girlfriend says that.  I think he's cracking under the strain.  You think?  He was probably a dick before, but he's cracking under the strain. 
[00:36:30]  How many women have made up gun lies about you?  Guys, I'm starting to think he's an asshole.  Yeah, I'm beginning to think that he's not good.  I'm starting to think he's an asshole.  Yeah.  Poor George.  We got the 911 call.  George is a pretty, uh, it's hard to defend, George.  Oh.  Fucking.  Well, I, I go on Twitter and just annoy the shit out of people.  I'm like, well, at least he got rid of a thug before he went to jail.  Yeah, but Trayvon was just a fucking... 
[00:37:00]  Jesus.  No, he was a thug.  Nah, he's...  Trayvon was a fucking thug.  He'd never been arrested.  It doesn't matter.  Most thugs were arrested by 17.  He's...  No, no, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't necessarily mean there are plenty of first-timers that have killed people.  Fuck that.  He punched him in the face.  That's a fact.  Whether George is an asshole or not, he's punching him in the face, and he got himself  fucking killed.  He had a record of fighting.  You know, he'd had not an arrest record, but he has a record of fighting in school, beating  up people, drugs, fucking stolen property. 
[00:37:30]  But look at...  Fuck them.  Goodbye.  But look at Zimmerman's.  Look what he's done.  He's had two people allegedly pointed guns at them that he's supposed to be in love with.  Alleged?  Whatever.  See what happens.  It's like, it's harder for me to believe his story with Trayvon Martin when he's coming  out like this.  Like, he's...  It's harder for me to buy what he said.  I don't care what they could prove.  Just his common sense.  He's not...  It's like, if he's just...  What are you doing?  You should be a nice laid-down, laid-back lifestyle.  You fucking got... 
[00:38:00]  You beat the rap!  Oh, I know.  Shut the fuck...  He's pointing guns at chicks?  What a dope...  I'm not gonna deny that.  We got another OJ situation.  All you have to do is fucking hang along.  Just go away.  Just chill the fuck out.  Well, I'm not gonna deny that he should lay low.  But, yeah.  I mean, he beat the rap.  Yeah, and it's like, you look at that and it's like, come on, man.  It's hard for me to believe that story.  It's like, I can't buy his story totally when you see that this is what he's doing now. 
[00:38:30]  Even though there's a lot of strain, I'm sure, and stress with this lawsuit and all  that shit, but...  Yeah, and, you know, again, it's all alleged.  I mean, I know there are two women that said it, but when you have a guy that went through  what he went through and shot somebody, if you have a woman that feels scorned or feels  like she needs to come up with something, boy, that is the handy thing.  Hey, he's got a gun!  Ah, Zimmerman, he's got a gun!  Like, that just... 
[00:39:00]  I'm not saying it didn't happen.  I'm just saying, you know, sometimes scorned women can say shit.  They have in the past.  We'll see.  And there's something about his fat face that makes him look not dangerous.  I don't know what it is, but there's something...  He does not look like a dangerous guy, even though he probably should.  Maybe it's because he got fat.  I like with the beard.  Yeah, with the beard, he looks...  It's a beard, he looks more like a fucking, more like a fucking problem.  It looks like somebody that belongs in fucking...  L.A.  No, in Cuba.  Oh, yeah.  On fucking Guantanamo. 
[00:39:30]  This guy's a fucking creep.  Guantanamo, yeah.  He's a creep.  Two women, and I'm not saying that they're not crazy either, but when both you chicks say  you pulled a gun...  Well, again, it could just be not...  The coincidence might not be that he did pull the gun on two women.  The coincidence might be the fact that women know that that's what you say if you have  a problem with George Zimmerman.  You instantly say gun, because you know that's going to get the attention.  But what are the odds? 
[00:40:00]  How many fights have you had where 9-1-1 had to be called with chicks?  Well, that's just it.  I've had almost none.  I don't.  Almost?  No, I'm saying none.  I mean, I've had big arguments.  I like the almost bar.  I've had big arguments that someone could have overheard just screaming.  Right.  I'll smash a bitch's head in with the phone before I let her call 9-1-1.  Well, as would anything be, man.  But, you know, what are the odds?  It's like, instead of just saying this guy's a fuck, the odds are that the whole Trayvon  thing, again, I'm not saying Trayvon was an angel, but he had never been arrested, and  he did not have a weapon, and he's dead, and two women who this guy lived with both had 
[00:40:30]  saying he pointed pistols at us.  The odds that all those things, in four months, the odds that all of those things are happening  that are just, he's a victim of circumstance, or the more obvious is that he's kind of fucked  up.  I think that's the more obvious conclusion.  Well, let's listen to the 9-1-1 call.  All right.  The meat of it, because it's like five minutes long.  We've got about a minute.  But he's smart, though.  He knew this would get out the audio.  Are you serious?  9-1-1, you need police fire medical.  I need police right now.  Okay, what's your trust? 
[00:41:00]  You're breaking stuff in my house.  What's going on?  He's in my house, breaking on my shit, because I asked him to leave.  He has his freaking gun, breaking all of my stuff right now.  I'm doing this again?  You just broke my glass table.  You just broke my sunglasses, and you put your gun in my freaking face, and told me to  get the fuck out, because this is not your house.  No, get out of here.  Okay, what is your name?  Okay, where's his weapon at?  He just put it down.  No, get out of my house. 
[00:41:30]  Do not push me out of my house.  Please get out of my house.  Are you serious right now?  Are you kidding me?  He didn't push me out of my house and lock me out.  Okay, you're outside now?  Yeah, he locked me out of my house.  She might be a little...  You know, I've been in relationships where the girl is irrational.  I mean, believe me. 
[00:42:00]  Every girl that ever fucked me willingly could probably have made this phone call.  It's just, you know, too many people are coming to the same conclusion that this guy is...  You know what I mean?  It's just...  I've never had a shit call 911 on me my whole life.  Well, yeah, you've got to steer clear of that.  But he's had two in four months.  Two in four months.  After the acquittal, when even though you're under a...  He should...  If life was fair, he'd probably be in prison, and he's off.  Right.  Dude, I know you're getting sued and it sucks, but you're not in jail. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I'm not...  You're not getting stabbed with a fucking shiv.  Right.  I'm not saying he's not a problem.  Yeah, he's a fucking...  But there's a problem there.  Just saying, you know, you've got to look into these allegations.  Yeah.  It's an easy way for women to, you know, get on you.  Yeah, it is.  But the first...  Just his wife, I had less inclination to believe her than the new girlfriend four months in.  Yeah, that's...  Come on.  Come on.  A new relationship and calling 911. 
[00:43:00]  Usually the first four months are easy, right?  In every relationship.  You'd think.  Four months, that's a cakewalk.  Some of it you attribute to stress, though, because, again, this is probably...  In the last year and a half, he's probably been cooped up.  Maybe his own making, but still, I get that, but come on.  Even if you're in a bad relationship, you don't know until the first...  Maybe six months in, and then you finally start realizing, oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  This person isn't for me.  But not four months.  That's hard to believe, actually.  Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen here. 
[00:43:30]  I guess he's got a bail hearing today.  He's in jail right now, right?  Yeah, they locked him up, and then I guess they see about bail today.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a fucking weird situation.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  He seems like a real...  Again, not having ever spoken to him, he seems like a real creep.  And I found him just...  I told you I didn't like him before I found him...  I didn't 100% disbelieve his story.  Yeah.  You know, because you couldn't prove that he was lying, but now I just feel like when  you think about this, how do you...  Well, also, his 911 call is very calm, you know? 
[00:44:00]  It's like, well, she...  A woman doesn't get that fucking agitated without something having happened beforehand.  And we've never heard angry George.  You know?  He's always like, well, I went over here and...  I think he's very aware of how to act.  Right, right, right.  On 911, he calls...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he's very aware.  He launched his guns up before the police came. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I was thinking that makes him more creepy, how ridiculously calm he could be.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  In stressful situations.  It's a bit creepy.  Right.  Do you have the tape?  Is that out?  See, I think there's...  Oh, his 911 call's out there.  Yeah, let's take a listen to that.  I think the Zimmerman case gets clouded because the media was so repulsive.  We automatically rebel against the press.  Yep.  And we look at everything the press does as agenda-driven, and it's almost like I don't  want to be blinded to what a piece of shit a guy is because of my hatred of the press. 
[00:45:00]  You know what I mean?  Sometimes I fall into that trap, too, where I fucking...  I take the wrong angle because I hate them so much.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  The way they handled it was horrible.  Yeah.  And, again, if you just go on the evidence that the jury was presented, you had to acquit  him, really.  I understand the legal, and I think OJ probably the acquittal was probably the right move,  too, because the prosecution stunk.  Yep.  You got the George Zimmerman.  Let's listen to this.  No, no.  Oh, no?  What?  All I'm finding right now is her phone call. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  What's that...  You've heard it, though, right?  What's that one down there?  This is hers.  Oh, that's hers?  Because it says George Zimmerman...  911 call.  911 call.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, I heard it.  It was, I think...  Give me a second.  His brother had it.  He had tweeted it at some point.  That's where I found...  What's his name?  Robert?  I found it.  Robert Zimmerman.  Yeah, he had tweeted...  911, you need police.  Fire, medical. 
[00:46:00]  Police.  What's the address?  Oh.  Yeah, it cuts out when he gives the address.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's a little address.  Yeah.  What's your name, sir?  Okay, what's going on there?  What's your name, sir?  Oh, my boyfriend, for lack of a better word, going crazy, young man?  Your girlfriend? 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Okay, where is she now?  Outside, with the police.  I'm following her.  Okay, the police is already there, and so why are you calling?  What happened?  Stand down.  Uh, I just want everyone to know the truth.  Okay.  The officers can speak with you on scene.  Have you already spoken with them?  No, but they're pretty upset, I think.  Yeah, the cops are upset.  The officers are upset?  Yeah, they're banging on the door and the window. 
[00:47:00]  You're not going to go speak with them?  I don't have anything to say.  To the cops.  He knew this was going to get out there.  He knows this will be in court.  Right.  Right.  One moment, I'm getting the information to the officer.  He's like, I better have a 911 call.  Look, the cops are pounding on your door.  You've got to, like...  I need one of those, too.  You've got to go talk to this guy.  This guy's just awful.  I remember my...  You've got to talk to the cops. 
[00:47:30]  In my trial, my 911 call was very key.  So I had better...  Were there any weapons involved?  I have weapons.  She has weapons in the house.  You have a weapon in the house?  Okay.  Yes, it's her house.  She's got a 9mm.  I mean, I have my firearm.  She was throwing my stuff out, and one of the bags was one of my firearms.  I never pulled a firearm.  I never...  He's already testifying. 
[00:48:00]  No one asked.  No one asked.  He won't take the stand, of course.  It's like when you give Columbo a...  You give him your opinion on what happened.  It's like, oh, right, that makes perfect sense.  Is her weapon put up?  I have no idea.  It's hers.  What about your weapon?  It's in my pants, bitch.  It's in a bag.  Get it?  Cock.  He makes a boring 911 call. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just the same fucking psychotic sounding cadence.  That's slow.  Are they still knocking on the door?  No.  I just wanted to leave.  Well, of course.  She told me that it was better.  She's pregnant with our child, and she told me it was better if we were co-parented, and  she raised the child on her own.  I said, fine.  I said, are you sure this is what you want to do?  She said, yes.  As soon as I started packing up my stuff to leave, she just completely changed. 
[00:49:00]  When you said she changed, what did she do?  At first, she was letting me pack my stuff so that I could go, you know, we could go our  own ways amicably.  When she changed, she just started smashing stuff, taking stuff that...  Now, on her 911 call...  ...throwing it outside, throwing it out of the room, throwing it all over the house.  Oh, he say, she said.  ...broke a glass table because she threw something on it.  She said, he broke the table. 
[00:49:30]  In her call, she said, he broke that glass table.  It's...  I find...  The reason I find her call more believable is because I...  In that moment of being so angry, it seems less calculating to blurt stuff out than it  does when you're doing damage control.  Right.  Like, her call is based on the moment.  Yeah.  His call is based on hindsight.  She probably fucking did something.  I don't think she did nothing.  Sure.  I don't think she was just watching TV and he pulled out a gun and broke everything  and threw her shit out. 
[00:50:00]  But this is something, you know.  I guess they had an issue.  Yeah.  And she was like, all right, get the fuck out.  And he's like, fuck you.  Well, no.  He wanted to leave.  That's what he said.  How is he fucking making money?  How is he pumping his load into some chick?  Where's his money coming from?  Is he working?  I don't know.  He's probably not making money.  That's why he's living in the house of his four-month-old girlfriend.  Oh, man.  That's a young girl.  Yeah, it's perfect.  She's got her own house.  She's mature.  Mature. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, of course.  How does he even get a broad?  Dude, where do you meet her?  There's some crazy broads out there.  They've known each other since high school.  Oh, there you go.  There.  He's like, hey, mind if I come over?  I need a place to crash.  I was on the news.  You might have seen me on the news.  So she obviously supported him through the whole trial.  I guess.  Yeah.  I was seeing the real George Zimmerman.  She's like, oh, boy.  What happened?  Seems so sweet.  She got mad, but I guess I told her that I would be willing to leave.  Okay.  I guess she thought I was going to argue with her, but she's pregnant. 
[00:51:00]  I'm not going to put her through that kind of stress.  Okay.  I have a hard time believing.  This is all damage control.  Ex post facto.  Is she still outside with the officers right now?  I don't know.  My mom's inside.  You're inside?  Okay.  And you're still not willing to go out and speak with the officers?  No.  I mean, I can have, you know, I can talk to one of the officers, but I don't want to go  outside and, you know, we're just going to do the same thing you did before. 
[00:51:30]  Arrest you.  This is full of shit, motherfucker.  You really don't want to talk to the cops, Mr. Fucking?  I can't get off the fucking phone with the cops fast enough?  Fuck this cunt.  Enough with this cunt.  I don't want to talk to the cops.  How is that an option when your fucking girlfriend calls 911?  Open the door, you fat fucking.  Talk to the cops.  And they're pounding on the door.  They want to talk to him.  Apparently it's not an option to not talk to the cops.  That's annoying me.  Mr. Fucking Law and Order.  Mr. Hey, here's the business. 
[00:52:00]  I made a left eye in Sycamore and went downhill and I was in a book depository.  But now he doesn't want to talk to the cops.  Fuck this motherfucker.  Enough of him.  What are the dead spots?  What is all that shit in this call?  I don't know.  Maybe it's pertinent information.  The call is playing right now.  We're just waiting for her to pick up again.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm advising the officers. 
[00:52:30]  But they're going to need to speak with you.  So you just want to...  Okay.  Can they call my attorney?  Oh, boy.  Well, they're already on scene.  Call my attorney.  Right there.  And you're...  So you're going to have...  Any minute now, you're going to have the right to remain silent.  Sure, I can talk to them on the phone.  What?  I can't talk to them on the phone.  Yeah.  This is now like a negotiation for someone barricaded in a house.  How fucking hateable is this guy?  In a house. 
[00:53:00]  Call my attorney.  Talk to my phone.  Worked pretty good last time when I talked to my attorney.  Yeah, he's the worst.  Can I do that?  That's still playing?  I think he's got a new attorney now, too, right?  That other guy, like, he's pissed off.  Oh, really?  The other guy's pissed off?  Why?  All right.  I'm just giving them the information.  Just give me one moment for them to acknowledge.  Oh, my God.  Let's get this over with.  All righty.  He's like negotiating his surrender. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Over the phone here.  It'll come out, but...  Don't throw me on the ground.  Now what?  Two sets of handcuffs, please.  It's got boring really fast.  Two sets of handcuffs linked together because my arms will hurt.  The call's still playing.  Yeah, I guess she's on the phone with, like, the cops, perhaps.  Was anyone injured or anything like that?  Very injured. 
[00:54:00]  When things were being thrown around?  No.  I dropped my Skittles and my shoes came off.  That's my dog.  Hello?  Shoot the dog.  Yeah.  Shoot him.  What happened there?  Are they arresting him there?  We're forcing him to talk, finally. 
[00:54:30]  Whoa.  And that's it.  Why is he being arrested, then?  That's it.  Well, I'm sure...  Maybe you have to.  ...with her story.  There, yeah.  They got to at least...  Check into it.  ...cuff him up.  Right.  Yep.  Well, there you go.  Oh.  Book of attorney?  That really annoyed me.  Even though it was probably the right thing to say.  It really, really bugged me.  I never liked him.  He's not very particularly...  He's not like them all.  Mr. Law and Order.  Mr. Law and Order doesn't want to talk to the cops. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, you couldn't talk to those motherfuckers fast enough.  I love Jimmy.  But you know what I mean?  It's like, come on.  It's the same guy.  Four months later.  Right.  So he took him on a tour of the neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  This was the street I grew up on.  This is the wrong name.  Oh.  Jesus.  All right.  Food is here.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, that's funny.  That call petered out.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Well, it was, again, just a hindsight call of, let me cover my ass here.  Right.  And it didn't work out very well.  After the break, we got today's apology.  Waddle-dee-doodle.  Every day we get one of these.  We got today's apology.  Nice.  Also, Bobby Brown's coming in at 8 o'clock.  Not that one.  Not the...  The video vixen.  Lovely girl.  She was the one from the Cherry Pie video and a few others, right?  She banged a lot of guys.  Did she?  Yeah.  Let's hope she adds one to the list today.  Oh, boy.  She's talking about cock size, too. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Yes, she is.  She better talk about the guys that she banged.  I would hope so, yeah.  What else?  That's what her book is.  I think so.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  And Stacy Keach.  Stacy Keach.  It's 9 o'clock.  What is he promoting?  I don't know.  Book.  Oh, you got a book?  A book.  About what?  Him.  Why did we get that?  Did they not give us...  Can we have it?  Does he cover his Karib years?  When he was Karib?  I don't know.  I'll go back and...  I never had a copy of his book. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Karib Abdul-Jabbar.  Karib.  I don't know.  He's a detective in the Caribbean.  I don't know what that was.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  Oh, sorry.  The Orgasm Wars, too.  Yes.  We got to promote Orgasm Wars.  Someone was telling me about this show.  It's just like, you got to watch it.  What?  What?  The Orpian Anthony Show.  The Orpian Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  The Orpian Anthony Show. 
[00:57:00]  Continues.  All right.  This is Dick Cavett, and you are listening to Orpian Anthony.  I was trying to figure out why.  A little inside shit. 
[00:57:30]  That'll be fun, right?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts.  Oh, the rumor's not true.  Heard rumors while I was away.  What?  I thought Sam was fired.  Oh, really?  But now I see him, so I guess that rumor was false.  What'd he do that was supposed to have gotten him fired?  Chick, chick, chick.  What?  Excel.  How was this show?  Big.  It was kind of reminiscent. 
[00:58:00]  Travis was right on about the Charlie Sheen comparison.  Right.  It was kind of reminiscent of when Charlie Sheen jumped on and started doing his own podcast.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that was really kind of sad.  Yeah, it was just not as fun when he was in an appropriate environment.  Definitely wasn't.  He was just kind of spending the whole time telling people to vote for him next October and to pay attention to his record.  Did you listen to E-Rock and adjust something?  Yeah.  Did it affect both of our mics?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  I turned all of us down.  Did you?  Yeah.  Now that E-Rock is...  I don't like it at all.  Why?  I don't know.  Now I've got to turn my headphones way up.  Oh.  Well, I'll do this thing.  All right.  There you go.  There we go.  That's better.  That's more like it.  E-Rock told me to turn my mic down, Sam.  E-Rock came in here and was like...  Why?  He said it was clipping.  He said, hey, asshole, turn down your fucking mic.  Well, I don't know what E-Rock's problem is, but I always like your contributions.  Thank you, Sam.  I appreciate that. 
[00:59:00]  We got today's apology.  Yeah.  Who is this from?  One that probably should have been made, although he...  Wow, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, although he won't be fired as he would be if the ideology were reversed.  Another safe target.  This fucking pussy media.  Ugh.  The Blaze had a clip yesterday from...  Who the fuck was it?  God damn it.  But he was talking about MSNBC and the fact that they are just full of vile, horrible people 
[00:59:30]  that say horrible things and with no repercussions whatsoever.  And I don't mind anything.  What kind of horrible things, though?  Give me an example.  Oh, my God.  Well, they hired Reverend Al.  We know what his past is full of.  Homophobic remarks, anti-Semitic remarks, race-baiting.  But now he's talking to the Oprah.  Yeah.  Now he's a fucking, you know, he's a media destination.  As Tim Sabian would so eloquently put it. 
[01:00:00]  And then we got Alec Baldwin, this is his second foray into faggotism, where he doesn't like or uses what they would interpret as gay slurs.  I could give a flying fuck with the MSNBC people.  If any of these people were right-leaning, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, had said anything remotely close to this once, there would be a concerted effort on the left to have them removed from life. 
[01:00:30]  But you don't think Alec Baldwin's coming back, do you?  Yeah.  Who knows?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Because you remember when Rush Limbaugh said to that one girl, he said something derogatory about that, whatever her woman's name was, about her birth control.  Yeah, that one that wanted the fucking birth control pills.  The fucking press was all over him.  He survived.  Well, he's Rush, though.  I mean, Rush is...  But he had to say he was sorry.  And for a giant like that to have to come out over some dumb shit.  Right.  And who else was it?  There was MSNBC.  Keith Oldman. 
[01:01:00]  You remember when the guy, that one guy, a reporter, had said, did they pimp out Chelsea?  He got suspended because he had said pimp out about Chelsea Clinton?  Uh-huh.  Fucking, oh, I can't stand it.  Well, we all understood how the word was used.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody knew that he didn't mean anything.  He didn't mean suck dick and give up her vagina.  Yeah.  They don't care, though.  There's other definitions of the word pimp.  Pimp out.  Well, the left-leaning media gets away with a lot more because their own doesn't attack 
[01:01:30]  them on it.  Yeah.  But the right?  Oh, boy.  I mean, MSNBC has a record of saying and doing horrible things.  They're the ones, you know, that edit fucking news clips and shit like that under the flag  of NBC News.  Right.  It's embarrassing.  Well, with that, we got Martin Bashir.  Yes, he's the latest one.  Well, this is what he said.  Our free stuff today is being paid for by taking money from our children and borrowing from 
[01:02:00]  China.  When that note comes due, and this isn't racist, so try it.  Try it anyway.  This isn't racist, but it's going to be like slavery when that note is due.  It'll be like slavery.  Given her well-established reputation as a world-class idiot, it's hardly surprising that she should 
[01:02:30]  choose to mention slavery in a way that is abominable to anyone who knows anything about  its barbaric history.  No one knows about slavery first-hands or shut up.  One of the most comprehensive first-person accounts of slavery comes from the personal  diary of a man called Thomas Thistlewood, who kept copious notes for 39 years.  Thomas Thistlewood!  In 1756, he records that a slave named Darby catched eating canes, had him well flogged 
[01:03:00]  and pickled, then made Hector another slave, S-H-I-T, in his mouth.  And he mentions a similar incident again in 1756, this time in relation to a man he refers  to as punch.  Flogged punch well, and then washed and rubbed salt, pickle, lime juice, and bird pepper.  Delicious.  Made Negro Joe piss in his eyes and mouth.  I could go on, but you get the point.  When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance, she confirms 
[01:03:30]  that if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, then  she would be the outstanding candidate.  And I have, you know what, I have no problem with that.  I don't have a problem with what he said.  But, again...  It's not that outrageous.  What she said was just dumb.  It wasn't racist.  It was just something a dummy says.  Let me tell you something, though.  Slavery is evoked for every fucking thing by black people. 
[01:04:00]  So, fuck it.  Good.  I'm glad Sarah Palin said that.  It's used as an excuse for crime, horrid behavior, fucking having 20 kids with no fucking  fathers.  So, good.  I'm glad she evoked the fucking precious memory.  Good.  And that guy's an asshole for fucking calling her out on it and not calling out every black  person that uses it as a fucking excuse for horrid behavior.  So, fuck him.  Fuck them.  Fuck everybody. 
[01:04:30]  He is a fucking, obviously a biased worm.  He is.  He's an asshole.  But she's also a dope.  And the thing is, it's not that it's an offensive comparison.  It's just a bad comparison.  It didn't make sense.  I don't like the way she tried to excuse it beforehand.  Now, this isn't racist.  Oh, I'm going to try.  And it was inaccurate.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  It's like, it's almost, you know, it's up there with saying, my boss is like Hitler.  No one thinks you mean he killed Jews, your boss.  Right.  I think her point was, you're enslaved to the debt.  Then just say that.  You don't have to go into this, you know, slavery thing. 
[01:05:00]  I think she was saying it that way.  I think she meant that, but it's, uh...  We're all smart enough to understand why she, you know, she used the slaves.  You're chained to the debt.  You're enslaved.  And then Martin Bashir really tried to push it.  He pushed it a little too far.  Why didn't she just say that, though?  Why didn't she just say, you're going to be enslaved to it?  I'm going to make a comparison.  Now, this is not racist.  Here it comes.  Now, this isn't racist.  That's why you dumb Republicans, that's why you're President Obama and not McCain.  She's that dummy. 
[01:05:30]  She's not well-spoken.  That's why she didn't say it better.  She's stupid.  So then Martin Bashir had to do this.  The apology.  Last Friday, on this broadcast, I made some comments which were deeply offensive and directed at Governor Sarah Palin.  I wanted to take this opportunity to say sorry to Mrs. Palin.  Sorry.  And to also offer an unreserved apology to her friends and family, her supporters, our viewers, and anyone who may have heard us.  And the man that would shit in her mouth.  I implied that she was going to take piss and SHIT in her stupid Alaskan mouth. 
[01:06:00]  You know what this is about, Reverend Al Sharpton behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Got a little you-know-what.  What do you mean?  Oh, you think he got mad?  Fuck yeah.  He's pretty much running MSNBC at this point because they're all scared of him.  I would bet money Reverend Al has something to do with this.  Really?  Yeah, because listen to this apology.  It is like fucking complete.  I think some people got on him. 
[01:06:30]  I believe so, too.  She's a woman.  I'm sure Reverend Al was rah-rah-ing, though.  They don't like that.  Rah-rah-ing, saying, look, he's got to apologize for this shit.  You think?  I don't know.  It's almost like it suits Reverend Al's agenda.  He hates Sarah Palin.  He hates Sarah Palin.  But this guy wasn't-  But he's got to support Black over anything.  But he wasn't really like-  Right, so why would he support over Palin?  Because he's like-  He's describing what was horrible about slavery.  He was saying, look, this woman's trying to compare something to something that's so horrible. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  And he wasn't downplaying the fact that it was horrible.  Right.  So I don't know if Reverend Al would be all that pissed at it.  But I think it was so self-serving, and obviously-  But he said what he said was offensive.  So what was offensive about what he said if what he was saying was accurate to what happened to slaves back in the day?  No, I think the part about implying that Sarah Palin should have her mouth shit in and her eyes pissed upon- 
[01:07:30]  Oh, that's not really offensive, though.  Yeah, I think that was the part he was apologizing for.  Oh, okay.  Quite frankly.  Oh, that's the easy part.  He's not even wrong.  How great would that be?  I apologize.  She really comes across as a dummy, though.  She did, and I tried not to get on that bandwagon because it was so predictable for people to say it,  but she just is a fucking-  An ass.  The woman's an ass.  Well, dude, they just let the-  They just blew it, picking her.  Without really looking into how she handles herself. 
[01:08:00]  No, but it's a big state, and I was in charge of it.  Totally.  And she never comes up with any type of solution, by the way.  Yeah.  She, uh, I don't like her, that's for sure.  You're not a fan?  Not a fan.  Not a fan at all.  So you kind of cringe when you see her on TV?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't-  The good thing is, I don't think she's very representative of what, like, Republicans-  They all steer clear.  I mean, you know, they steer clear of her. 
[01:08:30]  Let her fucking talk.  So where was she talking?  She's now on the circuit.  She makes a lot of money for speaking.  So who knows where that was.  Bashir continues.  So-  Our viewers, and anyone who may have heard what I said.  My words were wholly unacceptable.  They were neither accurate nor fair.  They were unworthy of anyone who would claim to have an interest in politics.  And they have brought shame upon my friends and colleagues at this network, none of whom  were responsible for the things that I said. 
[01:09:00]  Wow.  And at a place where we try every day to elevate political discourse.  Oh, no, you don't.  And to focus on issues that matter to all of us.  Oh, boy, did he get a talking to.  Yeah.  He got a talking to.  That's a complete apology.  Yeah.  That's not a vague one.  That is like, here it is, boom, boom, boom.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  That's an apology, all right.  That's too bad.  Why did they remove the JFK X mark from the street?  They did.  I wonder why. 
[01:09:30]  Because people were almost getting hit.  Unless they're doing a reenactment or something.  Oh, maybe.  Unless they're doing a reenactment, they don't want the X there.  Oh.  Digitally remove it.  You know, they're putting a family feud type sound one in there.  Oh.  So you know when he got hit because you hear,  Oh, that was a...  Yeah.  Mm.  That's too bad.  I like when these guys, you know, spew their shit.  Oh.  I apologize for saying that Sarah Palin should have been in two girls, one cup. 
[01:10:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Indeed.  I apologize to Miss Alaskan tub girl, Sarah Palin.  Whatevs.  Whatevs, Chipper.  I hear ya.  Bud, yeah.  Damn, man.  Did Carrot Top really say this?  What's wrong with him?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  That Sarah Palin should have her mouth shit in?  Yeah.  Well, he's...  I guess Oprah's doing a where are they now thing.  Oprah.  She's got it, yeah.  But Carrot Top never went away. 
[01:10:30]  Is she doing it on herself?  Because no one watches her dumb channel.  They don't.  I think she made a mistake going so female.  You have to pick a vibe.  But MSNBC is dying.  Her channel's dying.  Because people are not interested when they know 100%.  Yes.  Like Fox.  But there's just not enough conservative.  If there were more conservative stations, Fox would have the same issues that MSNBC has.  Your channel hits dying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's just...  But there's only a few places to go for that intense conservative talk.  Right. 
[01:11:00]  So everyone goes there.  I thought she was doing alright.  I think she's having a hard time.  Yeah.  She knew it would be like a slow build.  It's nothing compared to...  Where she was at.  What she had.  Right.  I don't think she cares as much.  Nah, I don't think she cares.  She's fucking very wealthy.  She's a billionaire.  And she knows...  Albeit it's amazing because in such a horrible, horrible racist country as America is, according  to her, I'm surprised she even made it.  Did she say that though? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, she certainly did.  Did she say America's a horrible racist place?  Yeah, she said America is...  Well, she didn't say horrible, but I would assume if it's racist, it's horrible.  Uh, she says that everybody, uh, uh, that criticized the president is, uh, doing so because they're  racist.  But she didn't even support him this election.  No, she's fucking...  She backed way off.  Why did I have Obamacare?  She, uh...  She backed way off.  He was front and center for his first campaign.  Isn't supporting somebody because of the color of others can just as bad as not supporting  someone for the color of others can? 
[01:12:00]  Sometimes.  I think it is.  Sometimes.  I think it is.  I agree with you sometimes.  And I'm not...  It's like, I hate to play the House liberal.  It's embarrassing.  Oh my God.  I was going to say House something else.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wow.  Jimmy.  Oh, Ed is such a hug of garbage.  You're really not nice.  I know.  Oh, that's funny.  I know.  Uh, but Carrot Top was on Where Are They Now with Oprah.  And, uh, boy, he's saying a few things. 
[01:12:30]  He is.  Now, this isn't like Carrot Top.  He's not known as a controversial character, really.  Right.  Can we just play it from there?  Well...  This is a different thing.  Oh, what is that?  What's that, Jimmy?  That's what Ant was just talking about.  Oh, all right.  Let me hear the clip that Ant's referring to.  Play it.  I'm playing it.  Oprah on the BBC.  I said play it.  Hello, everybody!  I'd already said it.  Oprah Winfrey has been a prominent supporter of Barack Obama.  She thinks that both he and the office of president have been treated with contempt 
[01:13:00]  because of the color of his skin.  Uh-huh.  There's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs.  And that occurs in some cases and maybe even many cases because he's African-American.  Could we pause right there?  There's no question about that.  And it's the kind of thing that nobody...  Oh, it's, uh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize the clip was almost done.  Go ahead.  ...or says.  But everybody's thinking it.  Everybody's thinking it.  Thanks for telling us what we're thinking.  Meanwhile, the Bush presidency, the way the liberals fucking dressed him up in effigy 
[01:13:30]  as Hitler and hung him and paraded his image through the streets.  Uh, disrespect for the office.  Bill Clinton getting blowjobs in the Oval Office wasn't disrespecting the office.  This, um, this fucking clueless bitch can shut her fucking yap because it's more of this  fake racism that's gone around.  How about the fact that he's just not doing a good job as president? 
[01:14:00]  And if you critique it, Oprah thinks you're a racist.  Fuck you!  You gotta think that a lot of...  There are a lot of people that don't like him just because he's black, though.  Sure.  All right.  You would have to have blinders on not to be in that part of the state.  Blinders?  I'd have to have a left blinder on.  Right.  But, uh, here's the...  I mean, a lot of people never even gave him a chance because he was a black guy.  Yeah, but here's the fact.  That's pretty obvious.  All you have to do is walk around and talk to people.  Here's the fact of the matter.  His fucking, uh, his sure thing votes are 10% of the country. 
[01:14:30]  13, maybe.  Uh, the ones that voted, much less than that.  White people put the motherfucker in office.  Stop already.  Yeah.  Stop already.  When I think of a...  I guess there are people that think like that.  We just don't really interact with them.  But when I think of Obama and I get annoyed at this tax shit, I don't think, like, oh,  that black fuck.  I just think there's tax and spend motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yes.  It really, it does not...  I have zero difference in my... 
[01:15:00]  When I get annoyed at him for tax issues...  Yes.  I have zero...  Right.  Fuck it.  It has nothing to do with it.  When I watch...  Race comes into it when I watch beatings on World Star Hip Hop and robberies and fights  at fucking Chuck E. Cheese.  Then the race angle comes in and I think to myself, why are black people acting like this?  Yeah.  But it's not when the president does something, I'm not saying, why is the black president  doing this?  I'm going, why is this tax and spend liberal president, socialist president doing this? 
[01:15:30]  The fact that he's half black doesn't come into play when I critique his policies and awful  terms that he's putting forth.  And that's where she's not fair about it.  Exactly.  There's definitely an element of that out there, but now his record is proving that, you  know, a lot of people are really not happy with him.  Dishonest.  I would love to see...  His approval rating is horrendous at this point.  Are there examples of what she's saying?  Like, maybe...  You know what?  I tend to... 
[01:16:00]  Again, I tend to react so against the fucking press that sometimes I'm probably irrational.  I would love to see what she's talking about, but where is she?  But she covered her ass.  Her big fat ass.  She covered it by saying, you might not see it, but they're thinking it.  Oh, Oprah's Kreskin now.  So, she's fucking telling everyone what they're thinking.  Yeah, that wasn't...  Because she wouldn't be crushing.  Well, that's true.  Thanks.  That wasn't too fair to say.  Yeah.  Because that would be a very, very small number, I think.  No, she says many.  I know.  She's trying to make it more of a thing than it actually is. 
[01:16:30]  I think the numbers are low on it.  The president's...  But there are people definitely thinking that.  The president's black.  She's a fucking billionaire.  Shut up with you dumb fucking racism shit already.  I've had it.  God, enough.  Well...  Yuck.  You had a bad night last night, huh?  Ugh.  What happened?  You could talk to us.  What happened?  Did you fucking channel get stuck on BET?  It's not.  You seem upset.  Yeah, you seem a little extra angry today.  What happened? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, no.  No, I'm not angry.  I'm just fucking...  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  But Oprah talked to the Carrot Top guy.  Well, actually...  And how bad for Carrot Top?  Yeah.  Oprah didn't actually talk to him.  Oh, wow.  It was one of those pre-tapes that was on the Oprah Winfrey Network.  Oh, boy.  She sent the producer to talk to him.  Oh, boy.  And you got Carrot Top just lying through his teeth.  That's what you're going to hear here.  Oh.  People think I've had plastic surgery.  No, it's just because I use a lot. 
[01:17:30]  It takes a lot of makeup to make me look good.  I was on a Comedy Central roast.  When they booked me on the show, it was like, yay.  All the comics were like, fine, we have someone we can pick on.  Like, they love picking on me.  And one of the comics says, Jesus, Carrot Top, when are you going to stop with all the plastic surgery?  You look like the guy from Mask or something.  And everyone laughed.  But I remember looking at the camera and I went, okay, I'm sorry that I look good.  I don't think I look anything different than I did when I started. 
[01:18:00]  I think I get a lot of grief because I've always been in shape.  And I think for comics in general, they don't expect comics to be in shape.  When I first started, I had my little Nissan pickup truck and my two teeny, barely funny trunks of stuff.  And I used to bring dumbbells with me, literally, to the hotels.  And then when I got to Vegas, I worked out more.  I really got into that training stuff.  I was like, holy crap, I'm like big.  Like, you really forget how big you can get. 
[01:18:30]  We've seen him up close and personal.  He's a cool guy.  We like having him on.  Really great guy, yeah.  But I don't know, man.  There's some stuff going on with that face.  Didn't he tell us that he tattooed his eyebrows in or something?  To make it easier for the makeup in Vegas or something?  He did bulk up.  I mean, he wasn't as big as he is now back in the early days.  He was a skinnier guy.  That could just be steroids or something, too.  And his face is definitely wider. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  What is he doing?  Pull your pants up, Carrot Top.  He's just fucking, I think, reacting also to all of this negative.  Like, he's become the punchline for so many guys.  And there's times, like, all right, you tease a prop guy.  But all these fucking fake edge corn balls that smash him like he's terrible.  It's like, come on, man.  It's not my thing of props.  But he's good at what he does.  And he's not a fucking thief.  He's not a thief.  No.  So leave him alone.  He's really good at what he does.  Yeah.  Might not be your taste, but he's very, very talented. 
[01:19:30]  But just the way they attack him.  I'm looking at all these pictures.  You know what?  I don't think he's had plastic surgery.  If you look at the early ones.  I think it's like.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's more of a makeup thing.  Yeah.  Can we go to.  I think the problem is.  His nose looks the same.  I think the problem is he, like, tattooed eyebrows on or something.  I think he admitted that on our show.  The cheekbones.  But besides that, it doesn't look that different.  Dude, look at the.  The only thing is, in the 2007-94 comparison, the cheekbones in the middle of the face look a 
[01:20:00]  little bit more pronounced in 07.  And he has a bigger face, so you would think the cheekbones wouldn't be as prominent.  Yeah.  And the chin is narrower.  But he's smiling there.  Yeah.  And he's stretching his face out in the first one.  That's very calculated before and after.  Yeah.  Just give us regular pictures.  Let's see.  There's definitely more of an.  It looks like there's more of an angle on the chin.  Pointier chin.  Yeah.  It looks like it.  You're right.  Yeah.  That could be.  All right.  So he had his chin done.  A little chin implant.  A chin implant.  No, I'm changing my opinion.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Okay.  He's had his chin done.  And his lips look fuller.  Oh.  Just more kissable.  And his cheekbones, even.  He's a bigger guy and his cheekbones are more prominent.  That doesn't seem like that's possible.  And then he has some weird like shoulder thing.  I wonder if he's had implants.  On his shoulders?  Yeah.  Or like body implants.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  He just works out like a fuck.  Right.  He would kick your ass. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Carrot Top would be a fucking problem.  With the plastic chicken.  How embarrassing would that be?  Oh, man.  Fucking plastic chicken is hanging out your asshole.  Right.  All violated.  Frank in Brooklyn.  He's on the roids.  I would think.  What was the peace about?  He might cycle in and out every once in a while.  What was the peace about?  Like where are they now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He never went away.  He went to Vegas and he makes a bloody fortune.  Yeah, he probably has a big fucking contract in Vegas.  Yes.  What is he?  The Luxor still?  He's got residency.  At the Luxor? 
[01:21:30]  Residency.  Or is it the MGM?  Not positive.  That must suck though.  You have all that.  You know, he's got the fame.  He's got the fortune.  He's got everything that he wanted probably.  And then you're just constantly getting shit on.  That's got to bother you.  Because at the end of the day, which is when everything happens according to people,  you know, he's probably used to the lifestyle he lives now.  So that's not a new thing.  But that fucking pounding he just gets all the time, it's got to be frustrating, man. 
[01:22:00]  Well, it doesn't help that he started out as a prop comic and no one knew who he was.  So they made fun of him.  That's probably what led him to working out like a monster.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  Boy, those props really do give you a bad rap, huh?  Yeah.  And there's a guy named Legendary Wid.  Do you know Wid?  No.  In, uh, in, in, out of Philly.  And he's, I worked with him in Wildwood and he's crazy.  Uh, but he's really a brilliant guy.  And like, comedians don't shit on him.  He's like a prop guy, the comics.  Because the stage, it looks like fucking Hurricane Sandy hit it when he's finished. 
[01:22:30]  He'll have giant, car, he'll have mess, big cardboard boxes filled with things.  But there's a real brilliance to what he does.  You can't.  Why don't we know him then?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  I've never heard the name.  I don't think there's even good footage of him online, to be honest.  Oh my God.  Not a toilet seat.  Boy, that toilet seat for prop comics.  Yeah.  That is the hackiest hack thing for a prop comic.  Looks like a hoarder.  Yeah, I'm sure he's been doing this for so many years.  I remember working with him in 1992.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, comics really like this.  Just play this clip. 
[01:23:00]  Very good chance it's not going to be good.  Good audio.  He took a blow up in a tube in a tube.  Yeah, it's blue.  Blue on it.  Right over there, here's an Eskimo urinating.  He's throwing ice out at people.  From his cross.  Ice cubes.  Eskimo with kidney problems.  Just one at a time. 
[01:23:30]  I like having to talk and tell people what to.  I've seen other people do that joke.  I think Carrotop's maybe done that.  I would say if anyone does something that the WID does, I would probably credit the WID  with it because he's been around for so many years.  For a real long time.  Carrotop's been around for a long time.  That doesn't even look that old, that clip, to be honest.  Like, that doesn't look like the WID when I knew him.  Like, he looks a little older here.  That's probably him, I'm going to guess, from like 2004 or 2005, whatever it was.  That's more recent than what I worked with him in like 1992.  Look at that mess on this stage. 
[01:24:00]  But he literally, he's the only prop comic that will like really annoy people in the  crowd by screaming at them.  Like, he's just so aggressive.  And when he's moving, he's fucking moving.  He's very enjoyable to me.  Let me hear a little more.  You can't do props on the radio.  Yeah, props on the radio.  No, no, no, look, I got that look just in case.  Oh, so we're just, and it's in a case.  He opened up the case.  He just dropped.  I love the lack of respect he has.  He just throws them.  Toy book, toy book, toy, toy bucket. 
[01:24:30]  The Titanic.  It's a toy boat hitting an ice cube.  I'll hold Bryce loose.  Here, take a bow.  Take a bow.  He's handing him the bow of the boat that he just broke.  Oh, what, did I go overboard?  Oh, boat jokes.  Colonel Sanders dying.  They kick the bucket.  Kick the bucket.  Thank you, honey. 
[01:25:00]  If I'm premated, extra crispy, of course.  Tall puns.  Wow, yes.  I love the WID.  Oh, boy.  I would go see the WID.  I do enjoy the WID.  Where is the WID performing?  I don't know.  I'd go see the WID.  I don't know if I'd enjoy the WID.  No?  I'm not sure I'm enjoying the WID.  Maybe not.  He's not for everybody.  But I do.  I would say, as prop comics go, comedians enjoyed the WID a lot more than most.  The WID?  Yeah.  Why does the WID have small wonder as his backdrop on Facebook? 
[01:25:30]  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  Yeah.  The WID's a little crazy.  Yeah.  The WID's a little crazy.  Just a bit.  Yeah.  A wee bit.  Yep.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Bobby Brown's coming in next.  Not the black one.  Oh, shit.  I suck all.  The chick.  The chick, yes.  The chick from all those lovely videos.  And Great White.  Yeah.  And Great White.  She was in the Great White.  And she hung out with Tommy Lee.  Once, bit, and twice shy. 
[01:26:00]  DiCaprio.  She banged a lot of guys.  And she banged DiCaprio, or at least saw his penis.  And Janie Lane.  Were they married?  They had kids together, right?  They had a cherry pie.  Janie Lane and her were married, or just had kids?  I'm not sure.  She did meth, though.  I know that.  She did meth?  Really?  Yeah.  She's a bad girl.  So we'll have to check out her teeth, make sure they're all right today.  So, she'll be in next.  Very cool.  And then a little later, Stacey Keech.  But first, this.  The Ethiopian Edition continues in a moment. 
[01:26:30]  The Ethiopian Edition.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Fuck yeah.  You like Smashing Pumpkins?  Oh, I didn't know who this was.  Chip does.  Jim didn't.  Chip.  Despite all my rage, I'm still just a rat in a cage. 
[01:27:00]  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Dang.  Oh, we got Bobby Brown outside the studio.  Yes.  Her new and only book, Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip.  What's up, Bobby Brown?  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Damn, you look good.  Thank you.  Hi.  Can I get comfortable?  Yeah, please.  Oh, my God.  Get comfy.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take off the old scarf.  Yeah.  Is it that cold out?  You need a scarf? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  It's freezing.  Oh, damn.  It's freezing, yeah.  Yeah, it's a little cold in New York today.  You got the big boobies working there.  Nice.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  Just trying to get to know Bobby Brown.  What's wrong with you?  I mean, if you're going to have boobs like that and you're showing them off, I got to at least  comment about them.  They're very nice, right, Jimmy?  She's very lovely, yeah.  Very lovely.  You look good.  Thanks.  Taking the glasses off, the eyes looking nice.  Thank you.  Are we your first stop today or no?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  A lot of interviews today. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Non-stop.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you an early bird?  No, yeah.  You do know a lot of guys whacked off to you, right?  What?  Well, is that bad to say?  It's soapy.  Does this look retarded?  No.  No.  No, not at all.  You look good.  You're rocking it.  Yeah.  You look very lovely.  Thank you.  What made you write the book?  What made me write the book?  Well, you know, I had been mentioned in like 13 other rock books and I thought, you know,  that's not really how it went down or...  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  So I just thought, I'm going to do my retort and from a girl's, you know, woman's perspective  and...  Yeah, their memories were a little different than...  Well, they do it kind of to serve them.  Right.  I find that a lot of books are, you know, famous people will write a book and it serves them  or whatever.  And I was self-deprecating.  I was, you know, brutal about myself and the truth about everything.  How did you get discovered?  Let's start there.  I was Miss Teen Louisiana.  Nice.  And went to the final, you know, Miss Teen USA and I got in the top five. 
[01:29:00]  I was number two in the nation and I said, my question was, what do you want to be when  you grow up?  You know, or whatever.  And I was like, I want to be a model.  And I had some calls and went to LA after I graduated high school and kind of took it  from there.  Wow.  Yeah.  But what was the first thing you were in that people knew you from?  When you hit LA, I guess.  The first week I got there, I booked a rock video for Hurricane.  It was, yeah.  And then shortly after that, I was Star Search winner. 
[01:29:30]  Like, no, I didn't win the final, but I won 13 times in a row, which is more times than  even.  What'd you do?  Spokes model?  Oh, right, right.  The spokesmodel competition.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did the spokesmodel competition do?  I always watched the concert.  They would like bring them in and out of the show.  It's like, can you read a teleprompter?  And now, we'll be back with more Star Search after Hith.  No, I mean this.  Yes.  So, you looked good and you read a teleprompter.  Okay.  Yeah.  And you got hit on by Ed. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, did Ed try to bang you?  Ew.  I don't know if I'd take it there, but he was definitely very flirty.  Yeah.  Who could blame him?  He was hoping.  Yeah.  He was hoping for something.  How does Ed flirt, though?  With the same line over and over.  Like, you know, that's like a lazy Susan.  Like, talking about the stage, how it would turn around.  And every time.  Oh, wow.  That's hot.  You know, I've done this 13 times.  I hear the same.  Oh, God.  You're not going to get a girl by saying lazy Susan.  No, not at all.  And I didn't even know what that was.  Smell my nose.  It smells like Johnny's ass. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, that's right.  It's pretty gross.  And then he also tried opening the door of his dressing room naked.  Oh, wow.  Wait, you're walking by and he opened his door?  You know, stuff like that.  Okay.  You know, stuff like that.  Hold on a second.  What were you doing when he opened his dressing room door naked?  Trying not to throw up in my mouth.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was pretty, uh, I was just like, ah.  Wow.  Stop walking, yeah.  Ed looks like he would probably be all bag.  Ed looks like he would have just big balls and a relatively small penis.  A micro penis. 
[01:31:00]  Like tube socks with rocks in it.  Oh, it was a big bag, yeah?  One of those with a mushroom cap.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  He had a mushroom helmet.  Nice.  Micro penis.  It was pretty, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  What did you do?  Did you say anything to him?  I was horrified and kind of just kept walking.  It's a different world back then, though, because there wasn't all these sexual harassment  suits and stuff like that.  Yeah.  You couldn't get a resource and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No HR.  Yeah.  To get away with that.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  Like, oh.  We call it the good old days.  Right.  The good old days.  What was the implication? 
[01:31:30]  That he wanted to sleep with you before the show?  There was no implication.  He was just all like, hey.  You know, just like, oh, wow.  Make him believe.  Whatever I wanted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever you wanted.  Make him believe you weren't walking by at that moment when you opened the door.  Yeah.  Something like that.  That's what I think.  What a creep.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then, all right, you're doing all this stuff.  And then, uh, what was the first, like, uh, big video that got heavy rotation?  It's gotta be Cherry Pie.  Was it?  Or was it Great White?  Actually, no.  It was Great White.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, Great White was before Cherry Pie?  Yeah.  As far as the videos go?  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  What was the song?  Yeah.  Once bitten, twice a while.  Yeah.  Once bitten, twice a while.  I remember that.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's when the, yeah.  Oh, I was in love with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You came out with that halter top thing on.  With your girlfriends.  Yeah.  Jesus H.  Christ.  Girlfriend.  That's an attractive girl right there.  Joining the party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They come sliding in toward the microphones.  Yeah.  And singing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Roll.  Don't believe me.  Yeah.  Ones that greened in my head.  I didn't like that.  But I thought the outfits were very skimpy in the feeling.  I didn't care for that at all.  Really? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I'm going to give you that.  It's kind of hard to become like a famous video girl now because videos are not what they  Exactly.  You know, there's no central place.  It's impossible, really.  Yeah.  You don't watch them anymore.  It's not the same, yeah.  Well, the videos do really well on YouTube, actually.  They are watching the videos.  Oh, yeah.  I guess so.  But MTV is not.  I mean, it's not MTV era.  Right.  Where everybody's watching the same stuff.  Yeah.  There's too many choices.  There's a whole community of watching that happened.  There's plenty of videos to watch on YouTube, but you're not all watching them at the same 
[01:33:00]  time and like, oh, did you see that one?  I remember they used to do the world premiere.  Oh, yeah.  It was a big thing.  They'd do that whole setup for it.  Yeah.  It was like weeks they'd be going, and remember next week, we got the world premiere.  Exactly.  The new Kip Winger video.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Did you ever fuck him?  No.  No.  I just figured it'd be a pertinent question.  No.  No.  No.  How long did it take you to get, like, after Cherry Pie, what happened?  The video premieres?  God.  It kind of blew up. 
[01:33:30]  That was the one.  That was the moment.  It was the one for like eight months or something.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Yeah.  It was.  That was all because of you.  In heavy rotation, they say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it did really well, and my career did really well, and kind of took off from there.  I mean, everything was Cherry Pie, everything, you know?  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't even like you were just a little bit player in the video.  I had no idea.  You were prominently featured there.  I was going to be in that video that much.  I was actually shocked.  I couldn't.  I was in it as much, if not more, than the band.  How'd you get the video? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  They knew you, or did you just audition for it, or?  I guess Janie was watching Star Search.  That's when my Star Search was going, and he called his agency and said, I want that girl  in my video.  That must be handy.  Yeah.  And I didn't go to the casting.  I was like, eh, I'm too hungover.  I didn't go, and then they called and said she didn't show up, and so then I went the  next day, and they were like, you have the job.  Wow.  Yeah.  It was pretty easy.  Did you start dating him right away?  No.  I had a boyfriend.  I was with Matthew Nelson at the time.  Who was that?  He was, his grandpa was Ozzie and Harriet. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  Wait, you went out with one of the Nelson?  Mm-hmm.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Wait, Gunnar and Matt, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I went out with Matt.  Matt.  They showed up at my Star Search, and they were like, wanted to meet me at the Star Search  show, and that's when I started dating him.  Did you tell them apart?  Yeah.  They were.  Star Search is like fucking Match.com for you.  Holy shit.  I think just walking the street is Match.com for her.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Everyone's trying.  Well, back then, you know, I guess I had it going on.  I don't know.  You still got it going on.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I could tell them apart.  One was kind of the asshole, and the other one was, and Matthew was the nice one, yeah.  Why was the other one an asshole?  He was the more, you know, up front, kind of aggressive, like, you know, you want this  shirt kind of thing, you know?  And I had just broken up with an asshole, so I was like, I'm going to go with the nice  guy.  So I dated Matt.  And how did that go wrong?  They kind of blew up.  Their career blew up, and he got too big for his britches.  Well, he became an asshole.  Well, yeah.  He might have became a little bit of an asshole, is what you're saying. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, and then Gunnar kind of controlled him, like, their career.  Like, he kind of ran it, because he was a pretty aggressive one, and I was bad news for  him.  So he made him break up with me, I guess.  I don't know much about the Nelsons.  They don't sing Garden Party, do they?  Who sings it?  That's his dad.  Oh, it is the father.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What'd they do?  They did all right.  Ricky Nelson.  Their first record was what they did well.  They did pretty well.  Yeah.  They did a couple hits.  After the Rain and Love and Affection. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  You would know him if you heard him.  Okay.  I wasn't a big fan, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I was definitely him.  It was one of my favorite lines on Beavis and Butthead, though.  What?  I was like, who are these chicks?  Totally.  So then you go with Janie Lane after that?  Yeah.  He found out that we broke up and, like, called four minutes later.  Literally.  And so we started going out.  But he had already been on Howard Stern saying he was going to marry me one day when I was  still with Matthew.  And I was like, okay, that was pretty baldy. 
[01:36:30]  Did you guys have, like, vibes before that, though?  It must have been some kind of flirting.  He had vibes.  I didn't have, I mean, I was committed, but Janie was definitely sending me flowers to  the set on the cherry pie video and would show up at my apartment, like, with my roommate,  like, hey, what are you doing?  I'm like, wow.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  So I told him, you know, I have your number.  I'll use it if I want to.  He said he was devastated when I said that.  Oof.  Yeah.  Fell in love, obviously.  Yeah, it works.  For a while there.  He gives every stalker hope.  Right.  Because, like, we're always told, like, you know, but once in a while, you hear that works 
[01:37:00]  for the hot girl.  The guy shows up.  It helps if the stalker's a rock star and not living in his mom's basement reading  Catcher in the Rye.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Were you guys officially married?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Okay.  For how long?  We were married for three and a half years.  Three and a half years.  And we have a daughter.  You had one kid together, right?  Okay.  She's 22 now.  Wow.  You have a 22-year-old?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  She's in the dean's list at college.  Right now, everybody's Googling. 
[01:37:30]  Seems like it is.  It's pretty awesome, yeah.  There's a picture of her in the book.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a current picture of her, but I don't have my phone in here either.  There's one that's relatively recent.  Let me see.  Definitely looks like Janie.  She looks a lot like him, yes.  Oh, yeah.  She's about, I don't know, maybe 14 or so here.  Yeah.  She's 22 now.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  You can look her up.  Is her name Cherise?  No.  Taylor.  T-A-Y-L-A-R Lane.  Taylor Lane.  So were you partying back then? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  What was your main indulgence?  I started off doing coke and then went on to do a meth.  It was the 80s, so it was the law.  Oh, you really had to do it.  It was like a three-day turnaround to lose 10 pounds, and I was a model, so, hey, you  have a modeling job this weekend?  Okay.  No problem.  I'll lose eight pounds.  No.  Here it is.  I got it covered.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And it was.  It was like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was meth popular back then, though?  I didn't hear about it in the 80s.  It was kind of underground.  It was like a secret thing that you didn't really talk about because it wasn't cool. 
[01:38:30]  It was kind of cheesy to do or something.  I don't know, but hey, it worked.  Right.  Yeah.  And you got addicted, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I think any woman who could see how much weight they could lose in a matter of  a week's time would become addicted had they known.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it was so, it was great, you know?  Like, to just lose the weight like that, you know?  Women would die for that.  How long were you on it?  How many years?  On and off for like 10 years.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, because then you get off of it and you start to gain the weight.  You're like panicky.  You don't want to, God forbid, work out or die it, you know?  So, yeah.  And it's bad because it screws up your metabolism and, you know.  Man, yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking crazy.  It was all rock.  So, you kind of liked the rock guys.  I did for a while.  Yeah.  I mean, I was just kind of thrown into that, though.  Everybody keeps trying to call me a groupie.  I was not a groupie.  I had my own career.  I wasn't, you know, hanging backstage waiting to get some rock dick.  Like, it wasn't like that at all, you know?  Right.  Like, I was a model working and it just kind of worked, you know? 
[01:39:30]  We met each other that way, but.  I just want to say you came out of meth all right, man.  Thank you.  No, because you see the horror stories in the pictures online.  You look great.  Yeah, thank you.  You lucked out.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  You wear meth well.  Well, thank you.  No, I mean, you've seen the pictures, though.  Hey, kids, it could work for you.  Take your teeth and.  Look, no, no.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Yeah.  How were you doing it?  Smoking it or snort? 
[01:40:00]  Both.  Whatever.  Whatever it took.  I didn't shoot anything.  No, okay.  No, I'm not needles ever.  I hate that.  But, yeah, smoked it, snorted it, whatever.  Meth is pretty brutal to snort.  Oh, my gosh.  Your eyeball goes rolling out of your head.  Like, you're like, whoa.  20 minutes, yeah.  Burns.  Yeah, it does.  I didn't even know I was doing it the first time I did it.  Really?  They didn't tell me.  And, yeah, and I was like, what the hell was that?  I never understood doing drugs when you don't know what they are.  When someone goes, here, take this, and people just pop it in their mouth.  You just assume it's all right.  It's called having a problem. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  I didn't think that was that.  Are you clean these days?  Yeah.  How long?  How long?  I'm not one of those who are all like, I'm 18 days for, you know.  It's been so long that I don't do that.  I mean, yeah, I still drink every now and then.  I'm social, whatever.  A little weed every once in a while?  Social, whatever, like I said.  But nothing runs in my life anymore, so.  You're not doing hardcore drugs?  No, no, no.  Did you date DiCaprio?  I read a little bit about that.  Or was that just a... 
[01:41:00]  It was just a hookup.  It was just a hookup, and I mean, he was young.  Basketball Diary time, right?  Yeah, he was really young.  He was 21 when he made Basketball Diaries.  Okay.  He was really young.  I was like...  I hear he has a big piece.  Why?  You know, to me, at the time, it was big compared to his little 19-year-old self.  And plus, like, now, it could be totally different.  Who knows?  He has put on a couple of pounds.  It might look a little, you know...  A little different?  Sure, sure.  Sure. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That was a long time ago, too, so...  Well, the part that was interesting to me was it was not his big, delicious penis.  It was the fact that he wanted you to put a condom on him for oral sex.  Yeah, it was weird.  What the hell's that about?  I think he was just like, you know, oh, I had dated some crazy rockers, and he didn't  know...  He was very uneducated about, you know, diseases, how you get them, how you...  You know, so he was, like, asking me questions that was kind of a mood alterer and negative...  What did he ask you?  Oh, shit. 
[01:42:00]  You know, do you have any diseases?  Do you have herpes?  Do you have...  There's a checklist.  Wow.  This isn't usually part of the foreplay, but, you know...  And then he wanted me to put a condom on.  I was like, ugh.  I've never done that before.  I fucking love him.  What a great attitude that is.  I love her.  Yeah.  Never did it before and never will again.  So there you go.  Oh, you like it raw.  No.  Who doesn't?  It was awful.  It was pretty gross.  Yeah.  It was...  Wow, that's so fucked up.  So did you put it on for the oral sex?  Yeah, I tried it.  I was just like, yeah, I'll try it. 
[01:42:30]  Sure.  Whatever.  And it was rancid.  It was bad.  Did he finish, though?  Was he able to or no?  No.  Yeah, that's hard with it.  Oh, man.  Write the book.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  But you have to...  It's like, even if I knew the answer to certain things, you still...  You have to...  No, I didn't finish.  I was about to finish with it like that.  I was like, ugh.  What, did you take it off him?  That's terrible.  I just...  I got off him, period.  I was just like, yeah, this isn't working out.  There's a lot of great stories in this book, by the way.  And I have like two more books worth of stories.  Really?  There just wasn't enough.  Let's get this one sold and we'll move on to the second one. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, right.  You know, I have lots of great stories.  You and Pamela Anderson.  Yeah.  I think you're hotter than Pamela Anderson.  Thank you.  I really do.  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  I always thought that.  Thank you.  And you hooked up with Tommy Lee, too.  Yeah, we were engaged.  Right.  Jesus.  Was he nice?  Were you with Tommy before Pam, right?  Yes.  Okay.  I introduced them.  And then he blows you off for her?  Kind of, yeah.  We were breaking up and she came around right around that time. 
[01:43:30]  And so, you know, four days later, it was kind of like he was giving me a play-by-play  kind of going like, I'm going to go, you know, fuck Pam.  I'm going to do this.  And I'd be like, fine.  You guys deserve each other.  Whatever.  Like, I was trying to be cool about it.  But little did I know that we're going to marry.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I was like, that was pretty devastating for me.  You really loved him, huh?  I did.  I did.  Yeah.  He was nice to you or was he abusive or a good dick?  He was all of the above.  Oh, shit.  Really?  But, you know, it was not until the end was it abusive or, you know. 
[01:44:00]  But he said, you know, for a rock star, very insecure, used to be very insecure.  But all of them were, actually.  Really?  People would think that they would have such confidence because they have so much going  for them.  And they're probably the most insecure people I've ever gone out with.  Wow.  Yeah.  So needy.  So needy.  It was weird.  Well, maybe also when you're on that level, you're used to dating girls that are totally  submissive to you.  And then when you have somebody else who has their own career, it might be a little bit  harder.  A little intimidating, right? 
[01:44:30]  Right.  They hated me having my own career.  They both wanted to try and stifle the career.  Why is that?  Probably for what the reasons you're saying.  Oh, because it put you in touch with other people on their level, too.  Yeah.  They just didn't like that I had my own shit going.  They wanted me to just follow them around.  Be dependent on them.  Yeah.  And I hated that.  And then you and Pam just never got along.  I was friendly to her in the beginning.  And, you know, I didn't know that she had any other eyes for my dude or anything at  the time.  But she was very flirtatious and she seemed to be the type of person who was validated by 
[01:45:00]  men attention, man attention.  And, like, she didn't have a lot of girlfriends, it seemed, at the time.  But the focus was definitely not on me.  It was on him.  So, you know, that could be different now.  I don't know her personally that well.  But, yeah, they got married four days later.  So, you know, I'm probably not wrong.  What do you mean four days later?  Like, he and I broke up.  They met.  And she tried to come around and hang out.  And it was probably like a month or so.  And then we were kind of breaking up.  And then he followed her to Cancun. 
[01:45:30]  I moved out.  And then he followed her to Cancun.  And within four days, they were married.  That all went down four days after you?  Yeah.  After our final breakup.  Yeah.  It was pretty devastating for me.  I have to say, that was the downward spiral to my addiction.  And that was a huge story, obviously.  We all saw that.  I couldn't go anywhere.  I couldn't turn the TV on.  I couldn't open a tabloid.  I couldn't go outside of my house.  It was like a constant reminder of this blow, this complete, you know, betrayal.  It was really hard. 
[01:46:00]  And I got down to 90 pounds.  My addiction just went spiraling.  What were you doing at the time addiction was?  Math.  Oh, just math.  Uh-huh.  And I got, like, out of control.  Did you have the money for it?  I mean, it gets expensive after a while.  No, no.  I was, I had my own career, you know.  I was making my own money.  And, yeah, I had good money.  How did you get out of the downward spiral?  God, it took, like, five years to just, you know, let go of the pain of that.  Because it was kind of like a publicized death or re-stabbing of, you know, with the back over and over. 
[01:46:30]  Like, having to see it just kind of killed me every time.  Did you do any things to get back at him?  Um, I called a press conference when they, after they got married.  And, um, basically, for free.  Didn't get, you know, charged any money.  I just wanted to do them a favor and let them know what had just happened and where they were and what their room number was and their hotel.  Oh, okay.  So, the answer is yes.  Yeah.  I did do something to get back.  Yeah.  So, I kind of ruined their, you know, honeymoon and their, their nuptials. 
[01:47:00]  So, but, you know, I, I guess they liked it.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You know about the, she says he has hepatitis.  I think he says he doesn't.  But did you?  He doesn't.  He doesn't?  No, he doesn't.  So, she lied?  I think so.  Yeah.  He doesn't have hepatitis C.  And, you know, and if he did, wouldn't her children?  You'd think.  I don't know.  You know, if, if he, if she got it from him, okay, and she had their children after they were together, her children would not.  Right.  You'd think. 
[01:47:30]  They don't.  Well, that's, like, breaking news.  Well, I mean, think about it.  It's just, like, logical if you just, you know what I mean?  Right.  Like, work it out.  I don't know.  But he doesn't have it.  Who was your rebound after him?  God, who wasn't my rebound after him?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Like, who was the first one where you're just like, fuck this, I'm going to town?  A lot of lucky guys.  He was, um, he was just a model, and, uh, he just.  Straight?  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucking weird.  A straight model guy?  Yeah.  Wow.  She goes, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was straight. 
[01:48:00]  I had a lot of, you know, it was kind of like a year of hate fucking.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  And then I, then I was celibate for, like, five years.  Then I went from doing not to.  Nobody.  It's like keeping a Lamborghini garaged.  What are you doing?  I would just do it.  I would just.  I would just do it to be a dick.  Yeah.  Take him home, screw him, and be like, here's some money for a cab.  Get out of here.  And they'd be like, what?  You gave them money to leave?  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I would kick him out, and they'd be like, well, you know you want this. 
[01:48:30]  I'm like, no.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, man.  Any tears?  That'd be funny.  You guys are like, come on, I love you.  It was really weird.  Yeah.  Put the fucking, put the stiletto heel in his mouth and go, get the fuck out of my house.  And then I wouldn't speak to them if I saw them out.  They would be like, hey.  And I'd be like, ignore them.  It was awesome, I guess.  It was just my hurt.  It was my pain.  I was just feeling flicked pain on everybody.  And then celibate for five years.  Wow.  Then it got, that was weird.  Then I got, like, you know, skin starved.  I didn't know, like, when I really wanted to have sex, but after the five years, I was 
[01:49:00]  like, what do I do?  What do I, I felt retarded all over again.  Wow.  Yeah.  It was scary, nervous.  Yeah.  Did you see the sex tape that they put out?  Did I?  Oh, you did watch it?  Did I?  You gotta read my book.  Yeah.  It was a joke.  It was a running joke.  Every party I went to, they'd be like, oh, I'd go to the bathroom, and I'd come back,  and it would be on, like, in the background.  I'd be like, oh, wow, here, it's that thing.  We showed it at Thanksgiving.  We showed it at Thanksgiving dinner one year.  It was awful. 
[01:49:30]  We had a showing.  A family showing.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I was like, oh, my God.  I'm going to be sick.  Yeah, I wouldn't like that in bed, either, actually, hearing, I love you, I love you.  I'm like, all right.  I'm like, come on, dude.  I'm like, come on, dude.  I'm like, enough of that shit.  Yeah, she writes about that in the book.  Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip.  Yep.  Yeah, you do kind of, you are fairly detailed.  I am very detailed.  And you said, I like the fact that you threw, I think Tommy you're still a little annoyed at,  because you threw a good jab at him about Tommy thought he had the biggest  of Leo, and you were like, good. 
[01:50:00]  Leo might be bigger than Tommy.  Wow.  You know, I don't know.  Like I said, currently, who can say, at the time, and I was on drugs, I don't know, but  at the time, I remember doing exactly what I say in the book, like, turn the lights on,  like, let me check this out.  You know, like, whoa, what, because I wasn't expecting that at all, you know?  So I was like, wow, okay.  So, yeah.  But, I mean, who can say?  He might have grown into his birth.  Right, sure, sure.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Like, you know, a tiger cub's got them big paws. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, you never know.  You know, like 10-year-old kids have their really big teeth and ears.  There you go.  What are you going to do?  Fair enough.  I don't know.  You said no one wore rubbers back then, either.  None of the rock stars did.  Yeah, rubbers weren't fun.  I don't think they were even so, but, like, yeah.  Terrible things.  Yeah.  Let me ask you, were you on the pill at that time, or no?  I was on a shot called the Depo-Provera shot.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  It makes women crazy sometimes.  My ex-husband used to say it made me a really gnarly bitch, but I just thought I was already, 
[01:51:00]  so.  I don't know.  What's that, five years or something it works for?  I was on it for, like, 11.  How many times did you get shot?  Once every three months.  Oh, that often.  Okay.  I'm thinking of the thing that gets implanted.  Oh, yeah.  They got those implant things.  They're like, it looks like there's little wires under your skin or something.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  It's a shot in the butt every three months, and you get a woman get no period.  It's kind of awesome.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do you have a tampon?  No.  I don't.  That's a pleasure right there. 
[01:51:30]  Sure.  It's kind of a plus.  Anytime.  Yeah.  So when did you mellow out?  Like, what mellowed you out?  I don't know.  Am I mellow right now?  No, but I mean, like, in the lifestyle-wise, like, as far as partying so much.  Well, you found balance, obviously.  Yeah.  You're not doing the crystal meth, and, you know.  Yeah, I wasn't going out.  Yeah.  God, it's been a while.  I don't go out at all anymore.  No?  I was just telling my manager, Lorraine, I was like, you know, I don't know if somebody  could pay me, because some girls were coming into the hotel just, like, just getting  home or just getting in.  It was, like, an hour ago.  Walk of shame.  Just all like, oh, you know. 
[01:52:00]  And I was like, wow.  I don't think anybody could pay me to do that anymore.  And I went, well, maybe they could pay me.  But I don't know that I'd enjoy it.  Yeah.  You know?  But, yeah.  I haven't done that in years.  Years, years, years.  Wow.  Have guys offered you money?  Offer me money to what?  Well, you know.  Have they offered?  I'm not saying you take it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  But, you know, I was too proud back then.  I was like, I don't need your money.  Yeah, I look back on that and go, well, maybe I could have reconsidered that.  But I never did.  Are you married now or dating? 
[01:52:30]  No, I'm single.  Well, single, divorced for a long time.  Haven't had a boyfriend for a while.  Yeah.  I don't really get hit on, honestly.  I get hit on online.  But, like, that's what's that.  Why do so many beautiful women say that?  That guys don't even hit on them.  Why?  I don't know.  Are they just scared or just assume that you've got to be taken?  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't know.  I mean.  It's probably that.  It's probably they think you're taken or they think, like, there's no way there's something,  you know, that she would go for me.  Nobody.  Actually, people just don't want to hit on me. 
[01:53:00]  And if they do, it's really crazy.  You know, like, it's over the top.  They feel like they have to be so over the top.  And that freaks me out a little bit.  Yeah.  What do you consider over the top?  Like, hey, do you want to go back to my house and fuck?  Like, what?  Oh, yeah.  That's a little over the top for me.  That's a little.  I like to go a little slow.  A little subtlety.  Somewhere between that and a couple of coffee.  Nice, right?  Have guys said that to you?  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  That's a bit much.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah.  Are you on Twitter? 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  All right.  At Bobby Jean Brown.  Are people, like, cool?  Huh?  Are people cool with you?  Or you get fucking assholes?  I'm the only.  Well, you know, I'm on a reality show.  I'm on a show called XYZ Rock.  And I'm the only one out of all the four of us that people go to and just talk shit to.  Like, just break me apart.  They tell me I'm fat or.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Twitter people are fucking brutal.  Do you love me?  Asshole.  I'm fat.  I'm ugly.  I'm a train wreck.  I'm a hot mess.  I'm.  I need to. 
[01:54:00]  A guy told me I needed plastic surgery.  Wow.  I was like, wow.  Wow.  And then to the White Knights ride in.  No, man.  Fuck him.  It's so weird.  I would never go to anybody and just rip them apart.  Just be like, eh, I'm going to go to them and just tell them what a piece of shit I think  they are.  Like, that's horrible.  I don't even feel that way about anyone.  You don't look like you had a lot of plastic surgery.  I haven't had any.  Yeah.  Well, you got the boobs done.  That's about it, right?  I mean, and that's my face.  No.  Yeah.  You look great, too.  Thank you.  In the face, everything's looking all right with Bobby Brown.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I've had my boobs done, but that's it. 
[01:54:30]  A fun thing to do, though.  It takes a little time.  You've got to invest a little time.  You look at their whole Twitter line, and you find that one link from a while ago where  they post a picture or a Facebook account.  And then you go there, and you find his pictures of, like, his wife and kid, and then you call  his kid ugly and his wife fat.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, it's classic.  And then, especially on, like, with this show, I just released the hounds.  The audience just piles on, and they say things I wouldn't even say. 
[01:55:00]  People are brutal, man.  They just really are.  Well, yeah.  I don't know what it is.  It's this newfound outlet that people have to just be fucking horrid.  We think out loud.  Yes.  Everyone can hear it.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I engage.  You know, my show will say, just don't engage.  Just ignore them.  I can't help it.  I know, yeah.  I have to fight back.  And then, you know, 90% of them are, like, apologetic and flippant or send me a private  message of apology, not a public one, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't want people to know that I'm sorry. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And, but, you know, I only have, like, a small percentage of them going, like, I hate you, and you're  untalented, too.  And then private message, just come over and fuck.  I know.  God, right?  So then I have to block them, but, you know, it's kind of weird, but none of the other girls  get that kind of abuse.  Yeah.  What do you like to do on a date?  What's a fun date for you?  I like to laugh.  I don't care what we're doing.  I think if you're funny or having a good time and just confident and whatever, I like to  go to comedy clubs.  I like to go get coffee. 
[01:56:00]  I like to go to dinner.  Oh, coffee and comedy clubs.  That's Jim Norton written all over.  And dinner.  I like eating.  And dinner.  Sure, sure.  I eat.  I'm definitely an eater.  Wow.  Yeah.  A girl who likes to laugh, I think I made a mistake.  I took her to see Lincoln.  It was really a dud, horrible date.  I think movies are bad dates.  Well, you don't talk.  Yeah, yeah, you don't talk.  It's, like, awkward and, like, weird.  Right.  Yeah.  Trying to make a move in the movie theater.  Unless she's into giving you a handy.  Right.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  That happens often.  A movie, like, in Taxi Driver.  Oh, my gosh.  Bring it.  Hey, where were you at with Janie at the end of his life?  He and I were actually really good friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, he asked to move in with me, like, a month before he died.  And I was like, you can't move in with me and my boyfriend.  I had a boyfriend at the time.  And he was like, why?  I'm like, okay, I should have known that, you know, I have a lot of regret about that  because I was like, you're crazy.  But, I mean, clearly he was reaching out in a way. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  To his first wife to ask to move in with me.  That's kind of weird because we had an apartment downstairs that we were renting.  He's like, let me just move in downstairs.  Like, that would be so weird.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  What did he die of?  Acute alcohol poisoning.  So did he know at that point that he was dying, you think?  There's so, I do think so.  So there's a lot of speculation and things about his death that I've come to learn that  nobody really knows.  But he should be alive right now.  He relied undependent on some people that he trusted to take him to get help, and they 
[01:57:30]  didn't.  They basically took him to get more alcohol and then dumped him off at a hotel under  an alias and left him there.  Wow.  That's where they found him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  So do you think that he was attempting to dry out or just to go to a sane place?  He was begging to go to a hospital, and they said they were taking him, and they didn't.  They basically, he was assaulted and left in a bedroom. 
[01:58:00]  Geez.  Why did they assault him?  His wallet was stolen, his shoes, all of his personal belongings, and he was checked in  under an alias and left in a hotel with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  Who are these people?  That's the question I want to know.  Do they know?  The only person that can question that is his wife, and she's not going to.  Why do you think that? 
[01:58:30]  Why?  Was there an insurance settlement?  There's some interesting speculation.  There's a lot of things that we don't know.  But there's some suspicions there, obviously.  There's some weirdness and stuff, some suspect stuff that, you know, came out after the fact  that really is annoying and upsetting, and I mean, I don't have all this stuff as, like,  valid proof, but I do have enough information to say that I think that he should still be  here.  Right, right.  Something's going on.  And that whoever's hands he was in at the moment really left him in a vulnerable position, 
[01:59:00]  and he should have been taken to a hospital.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah, and I'm saying that, and I'm probably going to get in trouble for saying that.  I'm not, you're just giving an opinion.  No.  It is.  I honestly think that if he'd have been in someone else's care, that he would still be  here.  Uh-huh.  And do you regret not letting him, like, you know?  Absolutely.  I have a lot of guilt about that.  But, I mean, really.  Like you said, that would be a weird situation.  It's a really strange situation.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Most times it does.  You know, most times when an ex wants to move in, it's, they're usually, you know, that's 
[01:59:30]  usually a bad move most times.  I would assume, yeah.  Especially when you're living with your boyfriend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would have been difficult for him to try and manage.  Yeah, I can't blame the boyfriend for not wanting the ex-husband rock star to move in.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Wow.  It almost never happens where the person is reaching out, and who knows, if he would  have moved in and then died, then you would have felt completely guilty, like, I shouldn't  have let him, because he moved in.  Yeah, but he probably wouldn't have died, because he would have been in my care, but that would  have been a lot of care for me to have to deal with, you know? 
[02:00:00]  Right, right.  It would have been a lot for me.  Who knows?  I mean, coulda, shoulda, woulda.  You know, I just don't.  Yeah, in hindsight, of course, you could beat yourself up, but I mean, it's really kind  of silly.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't.  So.  Wow.  That's something.  Heavy.  Any of that in the book?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's called Dirty Rocker Boys, and the picture on the cover is you in a red halter top, looking  rather lovely.  In my heyday.  With jean shorts and sucking on a cherry.  Yeah, that was from back in the day.  Yes.  Your lips look very lovely in that photo.  Thank you.  Trying to say that and not be creepy. 
[02:00:30]  No, no.  I have good lips.  You certainly do.  I was blessed with some good jeans.  Are you doing any book signings?  I haven't, I don't have a press store planned yet.  I mean, this is the first of my stops.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  So I think it kind of goes.  It's all downhill from here.  Yeah.  We rule.  I think it kind of goes with how it sells.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  What was Jamie Lane's Demons, you think?  He had a lot of, you know, issues with things that have happened to him, you know, along  the way that he never really had closure with. 
[02:01:00]  And.  Like what?  Or you don't say.  Professionally, do you mean?  Read the book.  Oh, I know, but.  I know.  This will sell the book, I'm telling you.  I know.  Because there's a lot of great stories in it.  That's a lot.  You know, things with, you know, family growing up, you know, no closure, things that happened  to him when he tried to succeed as a musician, like Tinseltown type of situations you maybe  put in or not put in or aggressed upon you that you wouldn't prefer or choose. 
[02:01:30]  And, you know, Hollywood at its goriest or most fucked up, maybe, and that he couldn't  really deal with.  And, you know, I can't really say what, but like, you know, just imagine, you know, some  fucked up shit.  There's a really hard thing when you're in a band, whatever.  It seems like it's hard to stay relevant for as the times change.  Like a few people squeezed through and managed to make the jump like through grunge and then  after grunge into whatever happened in 2000 to very bottlenecks. 
[02:02:00]  And then a lot of people are kind of left behind.  Well, grunge took a lot of them out.  A lot.  I mean, destroyed a lot of careers.  It really did.  I mean, it totally changed that entire decade of, you know, rock and hair metal and whatever.  I mean, as soon as, like I even say it in the book, you know, he saw the writing on the  wall when he went to his label and the warrant poster was removed and replaced with Alice in  It's a famous story.  Yeah.  And he was just like, I remember him coming home, just going, wow.  Like it just was, you know, hit him like a ton of bricks.  Like that's, that here it is. 
[02:02:30]  And it was over for those guys within a day.  It was unbelievable how fast the music.  It was like overnight.  It was unbelievable how fast the music changed because I was doing rock radio at the time.  Crazy, right?  And all that stuff, we were playing the hair bands.  Yeah.  It just felt like out of place, like instantly.  Yeah.  It was weird.  It was like overnight, literally.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  But you need a little bit of time and then what happens is there's a resurgence.  Oh, they came back a few of the bands.  People get nostalgic in 10 years usually.  And like Sebastian Bach and a lot of those guys are doing great now.  They're out doing gigs.  It took a while though. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, it always takes a little while.  I think you have to go away.  I think you have to kind of go away.  Yeah, you got to go away for a while.  If you're forcing it on people, they're going to be like, oh hell no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  If you go away and then come back, I feel like that's the best.  It needs an element of nostalgia to it.  Yeah.  It would grow a little bit and change.  Like Metallica cut their hair and it might sound like a big deal.  But it is a big deal.  It was a big switch.  All of a sudden there was something different about the band.  It just felt like a little bit different and newer, whatever it was.  And the music was still good.  Sometimes you got to switch it up a little bit.  Like Chris Cornell.  He went from that whole grunge hair. 
[02:03:30]  I remember.  And then he was on Rolling Stone with his new model cut.  You're like, whoa.  Yeah.  So yeah, I think it is important to change your look and your style in every way, I guess.  He's got an amazing voice, Chris Cornell.  Yeah, he really does.  Really, really does.  Very talented.  He is talented.  What a talent.  He is so talented.  He's a performer.  He is.  He is.  I saw him live.  He was really good.  Yeah.  Well, the book is called, I guess, Dirty Rocket Boys and it's good.  I flipped through it.  I didn't read the whole thing because I just got it yesterday.  So we have a crack team here. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I think we got it done, though.  We got some good stories out of Bobby Brown.  Yeah.  We got some good stories.  I like the fact that you talk about people honestly.  You're not killing anybody from what I read.  I mean, I just like, no one talks about that stuff.  They're always too vague and not that I need to hear about DiCaprio's penis, but you bet  I wanted to and I'm happy you talked about it.  I just feel like, you know, I didn't want to deprive the reader of any of the facts and  I don't make myself glorious in the book.  I'm very truthful about, you know, myself as well.  And I'm just honest. 
[02:04:30]  I'm just honest is what it is.  If anything, I don't lie.  I tell too much of the truth is my problem.  I overtell.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, I know.  And some good pictures in the book.  Thank you.  By the way.  Thank you very much.  It's always nice to know that Tommy, I'm not, DiCaprio has a really big dick because  you like to see a guy who's got a great acting career and is really handsome have one more  thing going for him.  There's nothing worse than reading that.  Like, you want to hear something awful.  Like, you know, the great big actors have fucking awful dicks.  Aw.  They come quick.  You have to root against them a little bit. 
[02:05:00]  Well, yeah.  Seeing you in bed with Tommy Lee, why would he blow that off?  That is just amazing.  Look at these pictures of Bobby Brown in bed with Tommy Lee.  Well, you know, I was getting to be a crazy drug addict.  And, you know, he's a cheater and he was a little bit physically abusive.  I couldn't do that.  What kind of physical abuse?  He shoved you or did he actually hit you?  No, he never hit me.  But, you know, he did, like, the control thing that guys do, like, you know, like, contain 
[02:05:30]  you or, you know, choke you and keep you from moving or, you know, doing stuff like that.  But I have to admit, I have a mouth on me.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get yourself in a little bit of trouble.  I'm not.  I don't back down.  I will fight you.  And so I will probably bring out the worst in anybody if they're trying to, you know  what I mean?  Like, I can say some shit that will make somebody want to choke me, probably.  I can imagine.  Yeah.  Some old school shit.  Yeah.  Just screaming.  Are you guys friends now?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Yes, we made, you know, we made amends with friends.  We communicate every now and then.  His sister is actually on my show, Athena Kotak.  She's Tommy Lee's sister and she's on X-Wise Rock with me.  And we're best friends, actually.  Did you ever go back to Tommy, you know, for a little?  For a little something, something?  Just to be silly?  Eat the book.  A little something, something?  It's in there.  It's in there.  Oh, that means yes.  I will say I never slept with him ever again.  I never had sex with him, but you have to read the book because I do.  Handy?  We do every few years try to reconcile or meet up. 
[02:06:30]  Double hand handy?  No, no.  I never even saw his penis ever again.  Picking teams for a baseball?  No.  For a baseball?  No, I couldn't do that.  I kind of felt like, you know, the one-eyed, peg-legged pimp down the street had a better chance  of getting me in bed than he did at that point.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Because I just, he was the one that broke me, you know?  And it was, there's no way.  I couldn't let myself be that vulnerable again, really.  You really want to annoy Tommy Lee?  Fuck a comedian.  That'll kill him.  Oh, man.  Why?  No, I'm just saying.  Jimmy's a comedian. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, just saying.  Okay.  That's good advice.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm just trying to help you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm just trying to help you.  Yeah, it's not about mates.  Of course not.  You're healing.  Okay.  It's about you're healing.  Hey, I appreciate any help I can get.  Well, Bobby, you've got to come back and see us, all right?  I would love to.  Thanks for having me.  Very cool.  Dirty Rocker Boys, Love and Lust on the Sunset Strip.  You can get that book now.  Yeah.  I'm surprised no book signings.  What's going on with that?  It's not even out yet.  The book's not even out yet.  When does it come out?  The 26th.  Oh, I didn't realize that. 
[02:07:30]  People have been talking about this book for a while.  They have.  All right.  So you'll be doing some book signings.  I think so.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  We're just in pre-sales right now.  Wow.  Okay.  So you can go on Amazon and get it.  And next Tuesdays, usually they come out on Tuesdays.  Next Tuesday, the 26th.  So that's when the book comes out.  Yeah.  And there was a huge three-page piece on it Friday in the post.  Yeah.  It's getting definitely good press.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And check out XY's of Rock on Saturday nights.  I take a peek every once in a while.  Who else is on that show?  I'm Sharice Neal and myself and Susan Blue Ashley, who was married to another guy from 
[02:08:00]  Warrant, and Athena.  Athena, right.  Yeah.  Who was she married to?  James Kotak from the Scorpions.  Okay.  Yeah.  Scorpions!  Yeah.  James Kotak.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Bobby Brown.  All right.  Stacey Keech next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show continues.  Continues.  Continues.  We need more.  We need more.  We need more.  We need more.  We need more.  We need more.  The Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[02:08:30]  Got Stacey Keech walking into the studio.  There he is.  There he is.  Stacey Keech. 
[02:09:00]  My God.  Good morning.  Good morning, sir.  Stacey Keech.  That's Stacey Keech.  There he is.  I know.  Is that working?  I recognize him.  Well, I'm trying to get on the network.  It's a big pain in the ass.  Yeah.  Trying out these Google Glass things.  And it's kind of a pain.  Are you a tech guy at all?  Are you a technology guy?  Not really, no.  No?  I, you know, I, I guess we all are to a certain degree. 
[02:09:30]  We have to use our smartphones and computers and, but, you know.  Some people just outright reject it, though.  It's always funny to talk to someone.  My wife is like that.  Where she won't touch email or any of that stuff?  No.  She's now, she's texting.  She's very proud of that fact that she's a text.  All right.  That's a start.  She's just a, you know, she's a click away from being an emailer.  Right.  Okay.  She doesn't want to do it.  What do you think it is that people reject that stuff for?  Is it, is it just, it seems like an overwhelming technology to learn?  I think so.  With my wife, that's certainly the case. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she is now, I think, so overwhelmed with, we have two kids and they do everything.  Okay, glass.  Anthony's looking at us with Google.  Take a picture.  What are you looking at in there?  What am I looking at?  Yeah.  I'm taking a picture of you.  You have one of those.  Stacey Keats, I'm taking a picture of you with Google Glass.  With Google Glass.  Google Glass.  This would blow your wife's mind. 
[02:10:30]  That's the first time I've seen him.  Okay, glass.  Yeah.  And pretty soon.  Record a video.  Yeah.  There's going to be a video he's going to see of Knuckles getting really close to his eye.  Oh, there it is.  Look, I got, I got Jimmy and Stacey Keats.  Got you both on there.  Fantastic.  There we go.  Look at that.  Oh, there it is.  Now I could just do an extended video.  Oh, there's E-Rock.  Here it is.  Well, okay.  You know what?  I'm just going to leave these on for Stacey Keats.  That's comfortable.  That's comfortable.  Okay. 
[02:11:00]  As I do an interview with Google Glass, I'm just going to hang out.  Now, where do you get Google Glass?  I don't know.  Some guy sent it to me.  Oh.  He's like, hey, check this out.  You can't buy it at Best Buy or something?  No, not yet.  It's like kind of a still in beta.  It's still in beta.  Testing kind of a thing.  You've got to show it.  So, yeah, yeah.  There's a little heads-up display in there.  Mm-hmm.  And one eye, which is a little uncomfortable to look at.  From this point of view, as well. 
[02:11:30]  You look strange.  Yeah.  With or without these on, I look strange.  But, yeah.  We thought you were losing your mind.  No, I was talking to my Google Glasses.  I love it.  Cheers to Google Glasses.  So, Stacey's got a book out, of course.  And this is you, huh?  Life on and off the stage.  Yes.  And this includes, wow, Alec Baldwin, forward by.  And this includes, like, everything you've done, television shows. 
[02:12:00]  Pretty much, yeah.  Because I remember Kareeb.  Oh, my God.  That was one of my faves back when I was a kid.  I used to watch Kareeb.  That's really going back.  That is going back.  That was fun.  That was a fun show.  I like those shows from back then.  They're kind of playing them now on certain channels.  You get some of the older shows.  Quinn Martin.  Yes.  A Quinn Martin production.  Yes.  Oh, it's out of the act one.  Street of San Francisco.  Street of San Francisco was one, of course.  Barnaby Jones.  Barnaby Jones.  The geriatric gumshoe.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:12:30]  My brother named after Quinn Martin.  No kidding.  We were a TV family.  I got a brother named Quinn.  Oh, be darned.  Yeah.  And not one named Martin, though.  Not Martin, though.  We didn't like the name Martin.  We liked Quinn, though.  Yeah, that was.  And Darren for Darren Stevens.  How about that?  You got a Darren, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't care.  It's okay.  All right.  I don't blame you.  Just useless information.  We were named for films in my house.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  I have a sister.  Her name is Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane.  No, you don't. 
[02:13:00]  I know.  Yeah.  Good try.  Okay.  What was the rename of that movie?  The Ninth Configuration.  Why did they rename it?  You know, that's a good question.  You'd have to ask Bill Blatty.  But I think it had something to do with the fact that, you know, by the way, he wrote the  screenplay before he wrote the book, which he did with The Exorcist as well.  That's weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't that?  It's very bizarre.  I didn't know that.  I didn't either until he told me.  But, you know, it's an extraordinary guy. 
[02:13:30]  And there's two different endings to that movie.  One where the killer Kane is killed in a bar fight.  And another version where he commits suicide.  And, you know, and he couldn't, Bill Blatty couldn't make up his mind as to which ending  to use.  And I think the reason he changed the title was because he thought, you know, I think  Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane was, it didn't have, it didn't reflect what the story was  really about, as if the Ninth Configuration does. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, but nevertheless.  I didn't know he wrote the screenplay of The Exorcist first.  So, because if you ever read the book, there's so much great dialogue in there, in the, in  between the, the, the demon and the priest and Karras.  And I would have assumed that he had edited, but he just added to what he had already written  as opposed to editing down for a screenplay.  Yeah.  Fascinating man.  He did something on, on that, when we shot that movie, then I've never had an experience  like this before. 
[02:14:30]  He actually had Barry DeBoerjean write the music for the movie before we even shot the movie.  He would play the music before we would shoot the scene so we would get in the mood.  Wow.  It's usually done completely the other way around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They play the movie for the.  Kind of brilliant though.  Yeah.  People got to put the actors into the scene.  Yeah.  That would kind of get you a little more.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you start off talking about your cocaine bust in, uh, in, in London.  What, what year was that?  In Kikai?  80, 1984. 
[02:15:00]  Peruvian flake?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  It was from Cheech and Chong.  Cheech and Chong, yeah.  It's turning blue.  Right.  Must be Peruvian flake.  How'd you get busted?  Heathrow Airport.  You were bringing it into the country?  Uh, I was, yeah.  I, you know, I, I, I was in denial and I had a shaving cream can safe that had the stuff  inside, one of those things.  That's clever, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  It's not a lot of those clever.  Well, I, not a lot of them.  Not clever when you put the real shaving cream can right next to the, you know.  Oh, because then it's like, why do you have two shaving cream cans?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, Stacy.  No, I really, I wanted to get caught.  Oh, really?  Oh, you did?  Wow.  Yeah.  I think I was at the end of my rope, you know.  I was in denial, but, uh.  Wow.  It was a few years ago.  Thank God I've lived long enough to be able to tell the story.  Wait, so you're going through customs with two shaving cream cans, and what's the first  sign of trouble? 
[02:16:00]  The first sign of trouble is the look on the, uh, on the, on the, on the security guy's face.  What's all this then?  Yeah, I said, what's this then, son?  And then he went in the back and he came back and said, what's in the can?  And I, I knew the chick was up.  Yeah.  I said, which one?  Shaving creams in one of them.  Oh, God, that's terrible.  Shaking the can, you know.  Oh.  That was it, when he started shaking the can.  So he, so you got busted, they arrested you, and how long were you in jail for? 
[02:16:30]  Six months.  Oh, that's quite a while for an airport bus for, I guess cocaine is a big one.  Well, it was actually a nine-month sentence, but they, I had three months off.  What year was this now?  84.  84, wow.  Almost 30 years ago.  30 years ago.  You were already pretty famous by then, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, my camera was, was swinging away, yeah.  Yeah.  How was jail?  Uh, not, not, not something I wanted to write.  No, I understand that part, but I mean.  Actually, though, you know, it was a very interesting experience, uh, in this respect. 
[02:17:00]  I, uh, the warden, uh, was a very compassionate man, and I think he, and he had a son who had  died from an overdose when he was like 24, 25.  So he was very compassionate, uh, and, uh, he made, he appointed me the librarian, and  I was, I was told that I would have to read and write letters from the prisoners who were  on remand waiting for trial, these young guys, the young offenders, and, uh, so I, there, 
[02:17:30]  many of them were totally illiterate, and they would get letters from home.  And they wanted to, you know, write back.  So, I did, actually, got to perform a, like, a public service while I was in jail, you know.  So people, so people out there have handwritten notes from Stacey Keech.  They don't know it, though.  They probably don't know it.  They don't even know.  So, when you get busted, like, when you, what were you going to England for?  I was, I was going there to do a, a voiceover for Mike Hammer. 
[02:18:00]  Um, I was shooting in the south of France, shooting a, a mini-series called Mistral's Daughter.  And I was supposed to go up to London to do some voiceover work.  Well, they must have been mad when, you know.  I guess that movie went, uh, went away.  And, like an idiot, I, you know, I was one of those, I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't,  I couldn't do without it.  Well, the amazing thing.  I was totally addicted.  You get busted like that.  I'm always, like, because when jail just stops everything from that moment on, it was, like, 
[02:18:30]  how long were you supposed to be there for?  Were you going to be there for two weeks or whatever?  No, a weekend.  I mean, oh, how long?  Yeah, exactly.  I was going to be there for a weekend.  And then go back.  And then, and then what happens?  How do you get the rest?  Like, when you realize, oh, my God, nine months or six months of my life.  I didn't know that time.  This was in April, I believe.  It was in April.  April, and then I, I went back, I was arrested, I was put in jail for the night, they bailed  me out, and then I went back to shooting Miss Trial's daughter, and trial was set for 
[02:19:00]  something like five months later, five months down the road.  And I was told that I was just getting a slap on the wrist, and there was, you know, and  that was it.  Wow.  And they let me go.  Why'd you go back, though?  You could have just came back to the stage.  That wouldn't have extrajated you for a little game.  Well, because I wanted to face the music in this respect, I wanted to go back to England  to work, you know.  And I, I pled guilty.  I mean, I was, I was, you know, I was an idiot.  Did they make an example out of you, you think?  Oh, absolutely. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  Did you clean up after that?  I did.  You did?  Wow.  Yeah.  Planky or two?  I was going to say, pled guilty.  That's kind of, maybe you shouldn't have done that.  Well, what could you do?  How could I, I mean.  Well, that's, because then they could kind of wheel and deal.  No contest?  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Blame Gillette.  No, I'm not going to do that.  Blame Gillette.  How did this get here? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I was saying, what is this?  No wonder I was enjoying my shit.  It didn't work.  Right.  Right.  It screwed the wrong way.  I would shoot the shaving cream right up my nose.  Hey, God.  Oh, my God.  And so you quit, from that point on or from jail on, did you actually get sober?  I got sober the minute I hit jail.  Mm.  Yeah.  And you've stayed since?  I have indeed.  Wow.  When you were doing coke and all that stuff, was it affecting your shooting at all?  Or was it?  Well, yeah, absolutely.  But I wasn't aware of it. 
[02:20:30]  You know, I was in denial.  I mean, I was, I, I wasn't, it wasn't a,  it started off as a social thing because in the 80s, in the early 80s,  it was everywhere.  I mean, people, you know, you go to parties,  it was laying out on the coffee table.  You go to a restaurant, the maitre d' would say,  let's go in the bathroom and have a little toot, you know what I mean?  You know, and I mean, it was everywhere.  But that changed.  And I think a lot of, you know, I may have had something to do with that.  I mean, in terms of, you know, finally recognizing the fact that it was not just a, you know, 
[02:21:00]  a lot of people got in trouble health-wise.  A lot of people died.  Yeah.  I had some friends who I don't have anymore because of it, you know.  And I was in total denial.  I mean, I was a medicinal user.  I would, if I didn't have that little bottle in my pocket, I felt like, oh, I can't, I can't go on.  I mean, I just can't.  Wow, so it was a daily thing of just, you know, all day kind of keeping it.  Well, yeah, but I mean, you know, moderately all day long. 
[02:21:30]  Right, right, just kind of stretching it out through the whole day a little bit.  Exactly, yeah.  Wow, that's something.  Do you ever see yourself on television or in a movie or anything and go like, oh, boy, I could tell I was a little wired.  Yes.  Yeah, I do, yeah.  Which one you, because Paul Williams came in, and he said that he would look at himself in his old appearances  and become so embarrassed because he's like, oh, yeah, I was so loaded on that one.  But we didn't notice, you know what I mean?  We didn't notice.  But he knew.  He looks back with humiliation.  And he would look at it. 
[02:22:00]  I'm sure that's the case with me, too.  I mean, when I, you know, Mike Hammer.  Well, Mike Hammer was an over-the-top, he was a little agitated anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Hammer's a great character.  I'll make a note.  I'll make a note.  He was supposed to be a mellow guy, though.  That's the problem there.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  He was supposed to be mellow, and they just got very confused why he wasn't mellow.  Grab a guy by the lapels kind of guy, you know?  Yeah, you weren't supposed to do that.  I loved my camera.  You were just supposed to give a talking to him.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, yeah, that was a fun show, too.  Man, you got a hell of a voice. 
[02:22:30]  I just, you ever do radio or, obviously, a lot of voiceovers and stuff.  I do a lot of voiceovers.  American Greed.  I'm the voice of American Greed.  Right.  What's that?  On CNBC.  It's a one-hour show about guys like Bernie Madoff and other fraudsters who scam us.  Yeah, there's a lot of, your voice is perfect for those crime shows and, you know.  I'd like you to narrate my life story.  He'd be perfect.  Can you say, and he thought it was a woman and realized it wasn't. 
[02:23:00]  And he thought it was a woman and realized it wasn't.  And then you have to pause and say, and he went through with it anyway.  Oh, Jim.  And he went through with it anyway.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Anyway.  How do you say anyway?  So much of those, like when you watch a documentary or like, I think Paul Winfield was doing those, 
[02:23:30]  the whole city confidentials.  You don't realize how important the voiceover wrapping around it is until you hear it done poorly.  And you're like, oh, this is kind of cheesy.  But when you hear it done right, it just kind of takes it around.  It's effortless with Stacey Keesha.  Amazing.  Really.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  Well, I talk about it in my book, All in All, which just hit the stands.  I'm very happy to say.  And I'm very, very pleased.  I got a chance to live long enough to write it.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  So there you go.  So you're friends with Alec Baldwin? 
[02:24:00]  Yes.  And I'm very sorry about all the things that have been happening.  The recent controversy.  Yeah.  That's got to be great.  You're out plugging the book.  It's like, oh, Alec Baldwin.  It's like, thanks, Alec.  Now I've got to address this shit.  No, no.  It's perfect, though, because it may put, you know, it puts.  He really gets bothered out there, though.  I've seen it.  I can't imagine.  He's very, he's a wonderful guy, and he's very protective of his family.  Protective, yeah, yeah.  And I can appreciate that.  Absolutely.  He doesn't excuse what he said, but he apologized. 
[02:24:30]  He did apologize.  He apologized, and you know what?  I think, you know, life goes on.  I don't like in this day and age that things are completely taken without context.  So if something is said, it's taken at face value.  Let's all be honest.  As men, you go out there, you get angry at something, you blurt stuff out.  Right.  It doesn't mean literally what you're saying.  It means you're angry, and for years that's the terminology that was used for, you know,  calling someone an asshole or something.  Well said.  Yeah, yeah, and I think that's precisely where it was. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, and I think that's what it is.  And then the apology doesn't matter anymore.  They want your job on top of it.  Oh, I know.  It's amazing.  We talk about this every day, Stacey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to bore you with this.  It's one of our rallying cries.  It's one of our go-to, you know.  Well, good.  I think it's good.  No, because every day.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  Oh, God.  Every day there's one out there that we talk about.  In this weird political correct place now where, like Obi said, not only do you have  to apologize, but you have to lose your job.  You have to be shunned. 
[02:25:30]  But they won't take your job until you apologize.  And then they're like, okay, now that you apologize, now we're going to take your job.  Well, it was like that whole thing with the Miami Dolphins a couple weeks ago.  Exactly, yeah.  Very similar situation.  Again, taken out of context.  It's got to be put in context of, you know, here's a locker room atmosphere.  Locker room culture is very different.  It's guys.  I mean, this isn't something new.  It's been happening for years like that.  Years and years and then.  Do you get tired?  I mean, you're like an old school guy.  You're a fucking man's man.  You must get tired of this, like.  How annoying do you find this culture, the way we're behaving? 
[02:26:00]  It's just irritating.  It's very annoying, you know, but I don't know what's the solution.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I guess just talking about it as we are.  Talking about it, and then it's all cyclical.  Occasionally, it'll move back the other way.  The solution is people got to push back more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see it on the news.  These guys know, but they just still play it out.  Yeah, the media.  Because they're looking for their headlines.  The news is ridiculous now.  And their audience, but. 
[02:26:30]  It's no.  But you've got to love Rob Ford.  No Walter Cronkite.  How great is this Rob Ford guy?  The Toronto mayor.  The Toronto mayor is a lot of fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  We love him.  We love him.  We absolutely love him.  I'm sure, you know, he's out there.  This guy could have used your shaving cream can.  I'm not an addict.  I'm not an addict.  I'm not as different.  I was, you know.  But isn't it funny to hear somebody talk about smoking crack and then acting like the press  is irrational for suggesting addiction? 
[02:27:00]  Right.  True.  True.  That's when we might see it the press's way, you know.  We're not unreasonable.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fantastic.  And he's trying to claim he only did it once.  And our thought is the people that did it once are the ones that die from it.  No one's ever smoked crack once.  Right.  I doubt it.  That was like the old days.  What was it?  I didn't inhale.  Yes, yes.  Bill Clinton saying that.  But he really thought that was going to work to say that he didn't inhale. 
[02:27:30]  It kind of did.  You idiot.  You don't know what you were missing.  Right.  Yeah, what are you doing?  By the way, book signing this Friday.  I don't know.  What do you want?  This is the 26th.  Is it this Friday?  No, it's today's the 19th.  It's next Friday, a week from Friday.  What day, Jimmy?  It's at Barnes & Noble.  It's November the 22nd.  If you want to meet Stacey and get the book signing.  November the 22nd.  In Calabasas, California.  Hold on.  That's Friday.  That's a week from Friday.  A week from Friday.  November 22nd, you're saying?  Is it this Friday?  It's Friday.  No, it's this Friday.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  In Calabasas, California, where I live.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that sounds nice.  Also, the DVD of Disney's Planes is coming out this week.  Oh, you're a...  I play Skipper.  Your voice is in that.  Yeah.  I play Skipper.  I got a three-and-a-half-year-old, so I'll hear you about a thousand times, so...  Fabulous.  No, it's not fabulous, Stacey.  You'll like it.  It's not fabulous for the parents.  It's fabulous to see it once or twice, maybe three times, but not a thousand times every 
[02:28:30]  time we go down to Philly on a car ride.  I like that idea.  Yeah, see?  Patton Oswald's a friend of ours.  I can't stand his voice because of Ratatouille.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  But I'm very happy that it's out on DVD for you, sir.  Thank you.  And you'll enjoy it.  You will.  I promise.  I honestly haven't seen that one yet, and we go to a lot of the kids' movies, so...  It's like Cars in the Sky.  Yeah.  Cars in the Sky.  Sure.  Have you seen it?  Did you see it?  No.  No.  But I heard that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I play Skipper, and he's the mentor. 
[02:29:00]  He teaches Dusty, a crop duster played by Dane Clark.  Yeah.  Dane Cook.  Dane Cook, right?  Yeah.  To overcome his fear of heights and win a race around the world.  And what type of aircraft are you, sir?  I'm a Navy Corsair.  Oh, back like Baba Blacksheep.  Yes, indeed.  Back again, in the same time it's like Kareeb was on.  We have Pappy Boyington and Baba Blacksheep.  That's it.  And occasionally we'd see you all together in Battle of the Network Stars, where you'd  all get together and fight each other. 
[02:29:30]  Stacey keeps you into Battle of the Network Stars.  I did.  I did.  Yeah, you did.  Stacey did Battle.  Are you sure?  Oh, yeah.  He once hit Barbara Bach with a rowing oar.  I remember that.  It was like Dan Haggerty from Grizzly Adams was on there.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  We all did that in those days.  And the other one was Circus of the Stars.  Circus of the Stars.  Do you remember that one?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  What happened on that one?  Tom DeLuise was going to take to the high wire.  Right, right.  It's like, probably not a good idea. 
[02:30:00]  No, no, no, no.  Circus of the Stars.  You did one of those?  I was the ringmaster, yes.  Oh, well, okay.  That's a little safer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good for you.  Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages.  Born in the roller skating episode of what show was that again?  Chips.  Oh, was that great?  The all-star roller skating episode?  No, I don't remember seeing Stacey Keats.  I remember seeing the cast of eight.  It was a extravaganza, man.  It was an all-star cast. 
[02:30:30]  I guess Punch and John were doing some charity event.  What show?  At a roller rink.  Chips.  Chips.  Chips.  Chips.  Chips.  Erika Strada.  Erika Strada.  Yeah.  And it was a charity event, and they had, like, all the celebrities at this charity event.  It just happened to be all the people that were on all the shows that were also on the  same network as Chips.  What's that?  But they were all forced to do this, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  They all did it.  They were forced.  Oh, so it was a special.  It wasn't a show.  It was special.  No, it was the show, but it was a special episode of the show because it had so many. 
[02:31:00]  What show, though, again?  What show was it?  Chips.  What's that?  Yeah.  Chips.  Eric Estrada.  Eric Estrada.  We did our first movies together.  Oh, really?  The New Centurions back in the day.  The New Centurions?  Yeah, it was Joseph Wambaugh.  It was George C. Scott.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Who'd you play?  I played this young cop.  Roy Feller was his name, who gets shot at the end and he gets killed. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, spoiler.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks a lot, man.  I was just going to go check that out.  I'm going to Netflix that one tonight.  Check out Nebraska, by the way.  Nebraska?  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about Nebraska.  Is that good?  Yeah.  Well, I'm partial to it in a minute.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  What is Nebraska?  We were supposed to see it last week.  Oh.  We skipped the screening.  Bruce Dern, June Squibb.  Will Forte.  Will Forte.  Yeah.  And Bruce won the Best Actor Award at Cannes Film Festival.  Bruce Dern.  We did that championship season together. 
[02:32:00]  Is he as eclectic as he comes across?  Absolutely.  He is the word eclectic.  That's a good word.  Instead of batshit crazy.  No, he's not.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  He's been in some amazing movies over the years.  And he plays a, this is his best work.  Really?  Wow.  I think so.  In Nebraska.  I don't want to put the Ken or her on it, but I think there's some Oscar.  Oh, wow.  There's some Oscar.  Oscar booze.  He wants us to see Nebraska. 
[02:32:30]  It's hard because they have screenings at times when we can't make it.  I wanted to.  They have them at certain times.  It's difficult.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, now it's out.  You know, it's around.  Oh, so we could actually see it at our own leisure.  He just told us to stop on our horseshit excuses in theaters.  I don't.  We don't pay to see movies.  Oh, Jesus.  That's crazy.  The 22nd.  Who does that?  You're doing the sign.  That's the JFK.  That's the anniversary, right?  50 years.  Yeah.  That's a...  Right.  It's you doing that.  I hate to ask the question, but you don't get to ask it much. 
[02:33:00]  What were you doing when that happened?  I was in the elevator at Yale, going to the Yale Drama School.  I remember going down in the elevator.  I was on my way to rehearsal.  We were rehearsing George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple.  And Frank Mulligan, who was the director, said,  Oh, we're not going to go on.  We're not going to rehearse today.  And we all went on.  And it was every day.  Wow, man.  How did you hear it?  He actually told you? 
[02:33:30]  Or was it...  It was on the radio of the elevator going down.  It was up, like, at the 26th floor.  Wow.  Slow elevator by the time I got down, you know.  Wow.  They hadn't...  He hadn't been announced dead at that point.  He was just an outshot.  When we got...  When I got to the school, they said,  He's dead.  It was a terrible day.  Terrible.  So what did you do?  What do you do after that happens?  Well, we went home.  We all went home and just, you know, watched television. 
[02:34:00]  Turned on the television.  I think that changed the whole temperament in America.  You know, that and Watergate were the two major, you know, those two events.  And again, that whole, like, go home and watch it on television, I think that was really the  first national tragedy that was so communal because it was televised like that and everybody  got to join in with the sorrow at one time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you watch Oswald get shot live on TV? 
[02:34:30]  I saw it live, yeah.  I can't even imagine.  We just recorded a wonderful play by Christopher Lee, not the same Christopher Lee, the actor,  called Air Force One.  It was done for the BBC and it's about the swearing in of Lyndon Johnson from the time Kennedy  was shot and all of that event with Jackie in the plane flying back and he was sworn in  by Judge Hughes and it's a radio drama and we just, it's on right now.  It's called Air Force One. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, really?  You just did it?  On BBC.  Yeah, and I play, I play Lyndon.  Oh, you do?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I play Lyndon and we talk back to the days of MacBird when I did MacBird years ago  on Broadway when I played and it was Lyndon Johnson in the, you know, really the Scottish  guy.  We can't say Macbeth.  Well, if you say Macbeth like that, you've got to spit three times and turn around.  That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's bad luck.  It's bad luck, yeah.  You've done a lot of stage work.  I have, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just getting ready to do Falstaff in both parts of Henry IV, parts one and two Shakespeare 
[02:35:30]  down at the Shakespeare Theater in Washington, D.C. next year.  Did you have reservations about doing television because, especially at the time in the 70s  and whatnot, it was not that prestigious as far as the stage?  Well, it was a different, you know, it was a different era, yeah.  And I got knocked pretty heavily when I did Kareem, you know, and I left movies to do  television.  You did get knocked pretty hard?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, wow.  You know, but now it's a whole different world.  Jealous Bastards.  Now it doesn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  I remember there's some of the best, yeah, there's some of the best stuff now available  is on television, some of the cable outlets and everyone.  Absolutely.  Making amazing shows now.  I just had a great run doing Sean Saves the World, I did a guest shot on that with my  dear friend Linda Levin, Sean Hayes, our player, a lascivious lover, and The Neighbors, where  I play the father on The Neighbors, guest shots, again, and a new show coming up called Enlisted, 
[02:36:30]  where three brothers in the army visit who they're going to become, and played by Barry  Bostwick, Dean Stockwell, and myself.  Yeah, that'll be on next year.  Visiting who they're going to become.  Right.  That's an interesting idea.  It is, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What a great career, man.  Yeah.  Just always working.  Amazing. 
[02:37:00]  I have to.  I've got two kids in college.  I've got to keep watching.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You also played Nixon on stage.  Yes.  Which I thought was interesting, too.  Do you like Nixon, or did you not like him at all?  Well, I had mixed feelings about him, yeah.  There were certain things.  I mean, when I played him, I certainly came to appreciate certain things more than I,  you know.  What did you appreciate more after you, I guess, were kind of forced to?  I think his vulnerability.  The fact that, you know, he had a, there was a side to his nature that I, during the Watergate 
[02:37:30]  era, that I was completely closed off to.  You know, I didn't, I didn't see the, you know, the, I wasn't sympathetic at all.  No, not many people were at that point.  Yeah.  I mean, you're just seeing, hey, this guy is the president who was trusted and lied to  everybody.  Exactly.  That vulnerability wasn't there.  No.  And you do realize how much, even back then, it's nothing compared to what it is now, but  the media really did.  That was one of the first, now there's another cultural moment in history. 
[02:38:00]  That was one of the first episodes in history where the news just jumped on it and had constant  coverage.  Well, that was it.  That was the soap opera of the day.  I mean, forget the soap.  We were all watching the Watergate trial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  And before that, though, there wasn't really, I mean, you could go back to what, the McCarthy  hearings, but even that wasn't.  That was newsreels.  Right.  That was newsreels.  It wasn't televised like that.  What was it that broke Nixon?  It was, I was like the fourth day of the interview, and I mean, from the movie, I'm remembering, 
[02:38:30]  and Nixon had made a call drunk, and he didn't know exactly what he said, or what exactly  got him, that kind of got Frost, what it got him?  Well, I, you know, it's a good question, and it's not really answered in the story, but  that phone call certainly was, for the audience, witnessing that phone call, you got a chance  to see the other side of his nature, you know.  Did he not remember he had called him?  He said he didn't, but I don't believe that necessarily. 
[02:39:00]  You know, he said he didn't remember it, but I, I think he did.  It just wasn't, he didn't want to, he didn't want to face it.  So when you're doing Nixon, are you trying to do the voice like everybody else?  How do you do the impression?  I never did any Nixon.  He went, oh, it's Nixon, eh?  Hip, hip, cheerio.  That don't sound like him.  Just completely just.  That does not sound like Richard Nixon.  That's Nixon.  That's, that's a good Nixon.  That is a good Nixon.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it.  I did a great, great, wonderful actor, Alan Cox, who played David Frost.  Yeah.  He was great. 
[02:39:30]  And it was a wonderful production.  It's a lot of pressure, though, to play such a famous figure that, you know, you know that  if you get it wrong, everybody in the room knows you've got it wrong.  Or if you're playing somebody else, they don't necessarily know it.  That's true.  Do they try to make you look like Nixon?  You know, I went through a whole makeup thing, which I talk about in my book, that I abandoned.  Oh, wow.  Because the director, Michael Grandage, very wisely said, we're not, we don't want to do  a literal, you know, rendering of Nixon. 
[02:40:00]  We wouldn't, it's important to capture the essence of his character.  But I did do a certain amount of, you know, of that.  I mean, everybody has a Nixon.  Sure.  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  Vocal.  What did you think of Hopkins' version in the movie?  I loved it.  Yeah.  I love everything he does.  Did they try to make him?  Yeah.  Anthony Hopkins played him.  I thought Frank Langella played him.  He played, yeah, Frank Langella did, but, but.  Oh, wait.  Anthony Hopkins did Nixon.  In another movie.  In another movie.  Right, right, right.  Oh, Oliver Stone? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, it was.  It was.  Okay, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking of first Nixon where it was Langella.  It was definitely, it was Frank.  Yeah, Frank Langella did a great job in that.  He was absolutely great.  But right, Hopkins did it in the movie Nixon.  I love the scene where the guy is like, then Nixon, I would never talk to him.  And then when Nixon walks in the room, he's just like, hello, Mr. President.  Yeah.  Humbled.  It just shows you how these guys alpha male everybody.  And no matter who you are, your ideology is.  Oh, when the president walks in the room.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  That's a big moment.  Sure.  Have you met him or did you ever meet him or no?  No, I never met him.  I never did, no.  But one of my dearest friends, Howard Kaminsky, was his book publisher.  And he told me great stories about him.  And so I picked his brain a lot.  And I talked to other people who knew him very well and tried to get some kind of understanding of his crazy nature.  So when you're doing a, we asked an actor recently, when you're doing, when you look at a script, do you immediately look at it and start putting like, he said he writes in the parentheses or in the sign? 
[02:41:30]  The margins, yeah.  Yeah.  My line, my line, my line, my line, your line, my line, my line, my line.  Yeah.  Do you do any of that, like emotional writing or putting verbs in the script or?  No, I don't.  I mean, not in the beginning.  No.  Generally speaking, you just, but I do the highlighting, you know, I highlight my line.  Oh, yeah.  You know, and then I, yeah, as time goes on, I find myself doing, you know, writing stuff down. 
[02:42:00]  See, I'll put little things in the margins.  Like, I'll put an arrow and I'll say flail arms wildly.  I'd love to see some of those features.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Can they always say do the opposite?  And I don't necessarily believe that, but they're like, you do the opposite of what you think you're supposed to.  People give you this weird advice.  And like a lot of times.  Well, do the opposite of?  Yeah.  They just try to sound like they have really great actor advice.  Why does he keep leaving the room when he's supposed to come in? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, exactly.  The director fires you.  Yeah.  Why is he pop locking?  This is a gulogy.  Well, you know, there are certain acting techniques that do suggest that, you know, if you're trying to do something with great intensity to try and do it softer and so you recognize how wrong you are.  You know, you recognize, you know, it's like by in directions, find directions out kind of thing.  Oh, you can't really tell if you're screwing it up until you do it another way and kind of look at how you were doing it. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, all right.  See, Brando, I watched Don Juan DeMarco, and I've mentioned this before, but it was a cool moment where I guess he was pissed off at one of the other doctors.  And he said, I'm so angry at you.  And he just said it like that, like really sweet almost.  And I'm like, you know, that was just such a brand, because anybody else would have yelled that line.  Yeah.  I certainly would have.  Yeah.  Pacino would have.  Pointed.  Yeah, well, of course.  Angry.  But that's me. 
[02:43:30]  Well, it's the yelling Pacino.  I like the yelling Pacino.  He does young Pacino, though.  Yes.  You're downplaying your young Pacino.  We're hoping he does Pacino in Angels in America.  Yes.  You do the soft-spoken.  That's why I do it, though.  But he does.  No, no.  He does.  All right, well, the book's out now.  This is great.  Absolutely.  It's called All in All and the Great Stacey Kitchen.  You can meet Stacey Friday night in Calabasas, California, at Barnes & Noble on Commons Way. 
[02:44:00]  He'll be doing a book signing.  It's at Barnes & Noble, so it's a nice place to go for signing.  Not many left.  Not many bookstores left.  No, they're going away.  Going away fast.  Are you a big reader?  I do.  I like to read, yeah.  Yeah.  Look at these.  Kudos, Martin Sheen, Jeff Bridges, Edward Norton, Oliver Stone, and, of course, Alec Baldwin.  That's pretty good.  Good company right there.  All right.  Who's calling me?  I'm talking to Stacey K.  Why did you give up on the Google Glasses?  Well, I was videoing a little bit. 
[02:44:30]  I didn't want to look completely silly the entire time.  When you videotape, you've got to keep your head completely still.  I'm like, my neck hurts now.  I saw you do that.  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know if they're really going to catch on to tell you the truth.  They're not going to be available for Christmas?  Oh, God, man.  I don't know.  Not yet.  They're still in beta mode?  Yeah, they really haven't quite gotten them down yet, I don't think.  Yeah, I mean, it's actually pretty comfortable to wear because you're looking, it doesn't  really interfere with your vision until you look up and just look like a creep. 
[02:45:00]  You look like Alex in the chair in Clockwork Orange.  Holding your eyeballs open.  Me glasses.  Yes, I guess.  It's a little teeny screen you're looking at.  I guess I can't see anything.  I'm looking at Stacey K.  Yeah, it's not on.  It's plain.  But I guess I can see the appeal of this.  But next, it'll be contact lenses.  That's where we're going next.  And it's going to be a lovely girl.  And then just implants in your eye.  And eventually, all of us will just kind of know what each other is doing and thinking.  And then we're just going to tattle on everyone.  The board.  And then we'll go 3D.  Oh, that'd be great.  Well, I see in 3D now. 
[02:45:30]  It's amazing.  Why would you need 3D when it's right there?  Right.  Well, you know.  We'll figure out to make it better.  Life.  We'll make it better.  All right.  Yeah.  Stacey Keech.  Stacey, thanks so much.  What a blast.  That was great, man.  Love having you in.  Thank you, guys.  We'll be right back. 
[02:46:00]  How great was Stacey Keech?  I love that guy.  Man.  He's very cool.  God, I used to watch him on TV.  Yeah.  And there he is.  Just being fucking fun and cool.  I'm great.  This job rules.  I'm very mad because E-Rock got in the way of my Bobby Brown photo. 
[02:46:30]  Where was he behind you?  Look, it's very obvious.  Look, it's very obvious that he got in the way of my Bobby Brown photo.  Oh, what's he doing?  E-Rock, what are you doing in my Bobby Brown photo?  Fucking lummox.  Thanks, Dick.  Actually, you got Sam to blame because I go, ah, fuck.  E-Rock's in the background.  I'm going to have to crop this shit.  Yeah.  And then Sam said to leave you in it.  So I moved it all the way over to the right to capture E-Rock in the background of my Bobby Brown photo. 
[02:47:00]  And you did.  It's completely off-center just so I can capture E-Rock.  I was going to say, in terms of E-Rock being accidentally in your photo, there might be some composition issues.  Right.  Yeah, what are we going to do?  This damn nagle kid's in the way again.  He's always got this nagle, this six bangles always running in the way over there.  Yeah.  Anything else?  Well, the why's listening to the why.  He just seems to get the why.  It's the whole cast.  I was just saying that. 
[02:47:30]  That was the pay of no mind list.  Yeah.  Put right on there.  It doesn't matter what he's saying.  If they did radio 50 years ago, it would have been...  Man.  Yeah, I don't know if it's heard, but some deuce is coming out of Dallas.  It would sound like they were gunshots.  Man, well, we got to do a song parody.  It's a shooty McPresidential brain splatters. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, this is Bullitt's McPlumpin' McAdoo.  Fucking idiot.  I don't want to comment on the photo.  Huh?  Oh, yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Man, I ain't good at something.  Read the comments.  Is there some good comments?  Yeah, there's two things.  Yeah?  There's two things that Iraq is being compared to.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  A young Santa Claus. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Oh, that's nice.  Chris Kringle.  He brings happiness and joy to everyone.  Yeah.  And Rob Ford.  Oh, wow.  That isn't even right.  I was expecting Kool-Aid, but all right.  Can you dress up as Rob Ford tomorrow?  Oh, boy.  For the goof?  Maybe dye your hair again like the old days.  Ah.  Well, he used Sun-In.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  But then he also...  Sun-In Chels.  Yes.  He also bleached it, too.  I know he bleached it, but last time we got on him, the last time he did it, he said, 
[02:49:00]  No.  I used Sun-In.  Sun-In.  And he put it in, he goes out in the sun, hanging out.  A little lemon juice.  A little lemon juice.  Yep.  I tried the lemon juice once.  How'd that work out for you?  That's stupid.  I'm like an idiot.  I just wanted to be a surfer, dude, so bad.  What an idiot.  Yeah, huh?  Hey, speaking of...  By the way, the event that we were going to have, I'm hearing it won't happen.  It's just not going to happen.  What event?  The one we've been talking about and planning. 
[02:49:30]  What?  Why?  What's the latest?  They want too much money.  And that's it.  It just doesn't exist.  The money that they want does not exist, and that's it.  Is it still at $350,000?  I've been away a couple days.  It should have been nothing, but that's just disgusting.  It's fucking disgusting.  It's up to us.  We've got to figure out our own futures.  I was too.  I would have loved to have done that.  I would too.  Who told you it's not happening now?  I was just texting with my agent.  I just asked for an update.  I'm glad they totally destroyed this great idea. 
[02:50:00]  Come up with an event.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what I would get.  They can't keep their fucking hands.  No.  Yeah, well.  Ah, that would have been fucking fun.  Great fucks.  And profitable and fun and great for everybody.  Because they asked us to come up with an event.  We did.  Yeah.  Every fucking promise has been broken.  Yeah.  Every fucking promise has been broken.  Uh-huh.  Well, there was that one, that one time.  No.  No.  I don't think there was.  You sure?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[02:50:30]  I bit my lip.  Sorry, buddy.  That's okay.  Well, at least the app's working.  So, that's just...  Oh, fuck.  Is the app working?  No.  No.  Oh, God.  We don't know if the phone's working because we chose to stay away from the phones today.  So...  Oh, we did, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we had guests.  And maybe they'll do something with the studio.  I don't know.  I'm sure.  It's never going to happen.  It's just...  And I hate...  Didn't Don Wicklitz say the screen was an easy fix?  None of it's going to happen, dude. 
[02:51:00]  Remember that, Ant?  Yeah.  He goes, oh, that I could do in a day.  And don't get confused by the new guys.  We like the new guys.  It's not about Don.  It's about the system in place.  They're nice guys, but they're as powerless to do anything as anybody else is.  It's not their fault.  Geldings.  They're geldings.  The fact that that event got fucked up removed the last ounce of fucking hope I have for  being here.  And the sad part about it, I presented...  We presented them... 
[02:51:30]  Presented it to them as our 20th anniversary thing.  They don't give a fuck.  So not only was it a huge event, it also was like, we want to do something cool for our 20  years doing radio together.  And Jimmy for, what, 13, 14 at this point, whatever the fuck it's been.  Yeah, they...  This all started 20 years ago with me and Ant.  It would have been a very fun event, a nice celebration, and they just had to get their  fucking greedy hands on it.  Yes.  And they've been begging for an event.  And they...  And telling us they wanted an event.  And they just couldn't let it happen.  We should just do it without them in a smaller way. 
[02:52:00]  Now they've torpedoed the whole thing.  And they had the balls to try and negotiate with us.  Like, they wanted a million dollars at first, knowing we would go, no, and then settle somewhere  in the middle.  And now it's $350,000?  I just...  They should get nothing out of it.  Nothing.  Yeah, it's just...  You know, we just do it.  They did offer them something.  I know how much money they offered them as an ad buy, and I know what else they offered  them.  We really got to start promoting our podcast, because it might be important down the road.  Hint, hint.  So please get the word out.  I hear from you guys, a lot of you guys can't afford the service anymore, which is unfortunate, 
[02:52:30]  obviously, because I would love more people to be here on the, you know, the Monday through  Friday show.  Yeah.  But at least there's a podcast out there where we throw an hour to, you know...  The latest one is about two and a half hours, because it's the best of Patrice O'Neill.  And yes, we will be doing another one of those, because people were wondering, because a lot  of the bits they wanted to hear, we didn't put on this one.  But they're loving, you know, the podcast we put out there.  So please get the word out for us.  I wonder if we can do it without them. 
[02:53:00]  I know, I wonder.  Can we do it without them in a small thing?  We're checking.  I'm talking to them right now.  Yeah, I guess.  Let's just do it without them.  Yeah, I don't need them.  We'll fucking sell it out with Twitter or something.  So, oh, oh, this week's podcast, the best of Mike Tyson's appearances on our show.  That's a good one.  E-Rock, you're editing that nice, right?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Thank you.  We'll be out tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning, we'll be ready to go.  How long is it going to be, you think?  I'm not sure.  I'm still editing the last two appearances.  Out of the four.  If it's a little long again, that's okay. 
[02:53:30]  And then we'll go back to a tight hour next week.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  A tight hour.  So the best of Mike Tyson's appearances on our show.  That comes out at...  When does it come out?  I know Wednesday, but right at midnight or kind of...  First thing in the morning.  First thing in the morning?  Okay.  And make sure, you know, people know about the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Hey, Rob Ford did his TV show.  Oh, he did the one he was plugging?  And Sam cut up a couple of clips.  And he explains the pussy comment. 
[02:54:00]  Well...  Needs no explanation.  We all understood it.  He licks his wife's fucking box.  He's a pussy-eating monster.  I should say...  Let me...  Charging.  I should say he gives an explanation for...  Okay.  Oh, he does?  You're connected to the...  Sorry.  You're connected to the computer.  Anthony's got a fucking plug going from the computer to his glasses.  Basically.  I'm charging it.  It's fucking...  It's almost like...  It's like a very, very early version of Matrix.  You're connected to the computer.  Well, you know what?  I had to... 
[02:54:30]  I took a video, and it's not meant to take a long video.  It's like...  The second you go, hey, take video, it'll take like a 10-second video clip.  If you press this button over here while it's taking that 10-second, it'll continue to just record.  But it's not meant...  The battery isn't meant to take long videos.  Oh, man.  I know.  They've got some problems with that thing.  This is beginning phase.  Now it's pretty obvious why they're not available yet.  Yeah.  They know they've got some major bugs to work out.  Yeah, exactly.  Battery life.  Plus, how the fuck... 
[02:55:00]  I mean, they need some kind of stability thing for the video, so they could fix that in post.  You know what I mean?  What are you doing?  It's just funny that I got...  Stop petting your glasses.  I'm petting my glasses.  Hey, quit...  And I got a cord in my face.  Quit petting your gills.  All right, let's see.  Pet something.  George Zimmerman arrested.  All right.  Well, no, I'm just reading the news.  Are you really?  Yeah.  That's cool.  That's pretty cool.  There's news in there.  I'll click that story.  Oh, it plays. 
[02:55:30]  It's a video.  No.  That's pretty cool.  Look, it's...  Can you hear that?  We're going to look at this in a couple of years.  The same way we look at your...  Remember we looked at your old TV phone?  Like, oh my God, that was amazing.  And now we look at it like you primitive cunt.  Yeah, this is silly.  This is kind of crazy.  What happened there?  It's a news story.  Oh.  Well, look.  We got a couple clips from Rob Ford's TV show, including him kind of explaining the 
[02:56:00]  pussy-eating comment.  So let's hear...  Let's see what his TV show is all about.  Ford Nation?  Ford Nation.  Ford Nation.  Rob Ford montage of the show's theme.  Okay.  And talk is cheap.  Action speaks louder than words.  Action speaks louder than words.  And you're going to see action like you've never been seen before.  You know what?  Talk is cheap.  Action speaks louder than words.  Not action speaks louder than words.  Oh my God.  Talk's cheap.  Action speaks louder than words.  Well, actually, that's the first action speaks louder than words, Joe.  Are you kidding?  It was a one-hour show with commercials. 
[02:56:30]  He said that that many times?  He just kept saying, talk is cheap.  I didn't get what he said.  Can we replay that?  No.  That's the whole point of making the montage.  I worked on that.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you make a dad-tage?  Mon.  Rob wants you to look at his record.  This is all part of Ford Nation, his TV show with his brother.  Look at my record.  Everybody has skeletons in their closet.  Minds have been exposed.  I can't speak for their counselors, but if council wants to strip all my powers, do whatever they want to do. 
[02:57:00]  I disagree with it, but you know what?  They have their rights, and I think it's wrong.  I think it's illegal.  Their rights are wrong.  But the people are going to have their say on October 27th.  I return every phone call that comes to my office, and I'm going to continue to do that.  It's like Ace's High.  To serve them.  This is like Ace's High.  It's exactly like it.  If he wants to debate me, I'm here.  Where are you, Mr. Webb?  Now, look, he's juggling.  No, don't do it. 
[02:57:30]  Don't do it.  Who was saying don't do it?  That was, oh, fuck.  Who was that?  It wasn't Pesci, right?  No, it wasn't Pesci.  It was back home.  Yeah, yeah.  Shepardini or?  Yeah.  There was no character in that movie with that name.  Can we start from the basics?  What the fuck is this show about?  And I don't mean ours.  It's on a news channel.  Yeah, but what is it?  Is it a reality show?  No, it's just...  Keeping up with the Fords?  What are we doing here?  It's just him and his brother standing at a news desk. 
[02:58:00]  That's it?  That's the whole show.  It sucks.  It sounds awful.  It's terrible.  When I heard show, I'm thinking reality stuff.  No.  Like, they go, I don't know, deer hunting and, you know, film it.  It's like Ace is High.  There's nothing put into it.  This is the whole show, this photo that you're seeing.  And the Rob Ford dancers.  Rob is...  And it's a one-off, too, by the way.  They're like, yeah, we're happy to have you here, and we'll see how it goes.  Maybe do another episode.  Oh, no, this is like Scorch's fucking...  Yes.  This is PGA TV? 
[02:58:30]  PGA.  PG-TV?  P-G-F.  P-G-F-G.  P-G-F-G.  P-F-G.  Two.  Two.  Virgin Two.  Virgin Two.  I thought they signed for like eight episodes.  No.  It was a one and done?  They made it sound like it was like the biggest show on TV about to hit.  No, and it's a terrible, terrible show.  Rob is getting help.  What are you going to do, Rob, moving forward?  The gentleman asked you, what are you going to do in the next election?  Well, I'm dealing with health care professionals.  There's no...  No, no, no.  What the question is, what's the game plan? 
[02:59:00]  We're building subways in the next election.  Absolutely.  No, but he's asking, I think, personally, how are you going to basically change your image?  Well, I'm going to be working out.  But if I'm not down at 30, 40 pounds in the next six months, then I can eat my words.  You know, if you have a touch to drop of alcohol, I'm dealing with a team of professionals.  I'm getting the help for sometimes my excessive drinking.  But, guys, I think this is getting blown out of proportion.  I'm here.  I've never missed a day of counsel.  Blown out of proportion.  You put my attendance record up against any counselors down there, and I guarantee I'll be in the top ten. 
[02:59:30]  And I'm the mayor.  He stinks.  You can't fucking...  I hate this.  I like it better when he just, like, decides to roll out of that office of his and say crazy shit.  Right.  It's better when it's in the inappropriate context.  Yeah, I don't like it as much.  It's the same thing as the Charlie Sheen deal.  It's better when he was doing interviews and saying crazy shit than when he just was like, hey, point a camera at me.  I don't need an interviewer.  Rob isn't drinking anymore.  You're going to do your own program to get there.  I'm not going to tell anyone what I'm doing. 
[03:00:00]  I'm not going to talk about the health professionals, but I can assure you I'm dealing with professional people.  You haven't been drinking at all?  I haven't had a drop of alcohol in three weeks.  I dropped.  I dropped.  I dropped.  I'll take a urine test right now.  And if there's alcohol...  He hasn't had a drop of alcohol?  Not zero.  I'll do a urine test right now.  When's the last time for drugs?  A long time.  I'm talking like a long time ago.  What about drug testing?  A long time.  Like a long time ago.  I'm talking a long time ago.  Oh, boy, he doesn't want to put a date on that one. 
[03:00:30]  Sounds to me like a bunch of bull sugar.  Your money's no good here, Mr. Ford.  Awesome job of the guy with him asking the follow-up question.  A long time.  I'm talking a long time.  All right, that one's answered.  No, you've got to stop and go, no, give me a date.  Because he's paranoid there might be another videotape out there.  He's bull sugaring.  All right.  And you can dive in for the rest of the council.  I'll be the first one to do a drug test.  I put a motion on the table.  I don't know why we're going down this, to go personal, but I have no problem doing it. 
[03:01:00]  I'll do a drug test.  I want to speculate.  Here's why.  You're the mayor of Toronto, and you admitted smoking crack.  That's why we're going down this road.  And drinking, and fucking around with your female employees.  And eating a lot of pussy.  And hookers, and fucking all kinds of allegations.  He didn't say that.  No, I didn't think he said peck is.  Nobody did.  Whatever.  Peck is.  Peck is.  I go personal, but I have no problem doing it.  I'll do a drug test, an alcohol test right now.  And I put a motion forward that every counselor do it too. 
[03:01:30]  You know what?  They jumped up.  They don't want anything to do with it.  Counselor.  Yeah.  I hope he says something crazy today.  I'm sure he will.  This is too organized.  He's so delusional.  I mean, no surprises there.  But he is so fucking delusional as far as his fucking drug and drinking.  Right.  You know, it's not going to continue, man.  So if Chipler doesn't say what he said, what you were upset about, and the different things, 
[03:02:00]  would we be where we are now?  My question is, I urinated in a parking lot.  What does that have to do?  Bring up the beer at my St. Patrick's Day party two years ago.  What does that have to do with anything?  You don't have to do, Rob, it's politics.  Wow, that's just amazing.  Like, can you imagine Mayor Bloomberg was caught urinating in a parking lot?  Pissing in a parking lot.  And then he keeps bringing it up?  Yeah.  I urinated in a parking lot.  So what?  It's no big deal if you're a shock jock going to a fucking Jets game or something. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it kind of comes with a job that you gotta, maybe that's your thing.  There's a certain decorum.  But you just can't do stuff like that anymore.  Right.  Because they're gonna just kill you for it.  But this guy's all about pissing in parking lots.  Right.  Oh, God.  Like, just look at him.  Oh, yeah.  That really sums him up.  He's a regular guy.  A regular guy.  Oh, man.  Fucking.  Make it to Mayor.  You gotta stop the crack thing. 
[03:03:00]  You can't pee in the bucket part a lot.  You can't drop a hot piss in public.  You can't knock over old ladies by accident.  Uh, you can't, you know, make believe you're drunk driving in Parliament.  I bet because it's Canada.  On the floor of Parliament.  I bet because it's Canada, like, it was a big, steamy piss.  Just fucking, like, steam coming off of it.  Fucking Molson, Molson ice.  Because, you know, inside that big, fat body, the bladder is just full of hot piss. 
[03:03:30]  Just writing his name in the snow.  Hey, look what I wrote!  Goofing around with his piss.  Writing racial slurs in the snow.  Oh, yes!  Yes!  I bet, Marty, he's probably done that a time or two.  Those long, long fucking drunk pisses.  He's drinking beer and just fucking pissing.  Yeah.  Nice.  And then finally he explains the pussy thing.  Oh, good.  Well, welcome back to Sun News and Ford Nation. 
[03:04:00]  That was an inappropriate comment that I made.  But, obviously, that was just off the cuff and very frustrated at the time.  Off the cuff.  And, again, it was inappropriate.  But, you know, I am happily married.  I have a lovely wife, Renaud.  I got two beautiful kids, Stephanie and Douglas.  And I love them dearly.  And I know my brother, Doug, has four beautiful girls.  And I don't touch their pussy.  Again, it was a pretty stressful week. 
[03:04:30]  And there's no excuse for it.  I don't use excuses and cop-outs.  So, again, I made a mistake.  So, we're going to move on talking about our record.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you about that comment.  I was totally shocked.  You've never made any comments off the cuff, have you?  Never.  Not me.  No, no.  Oh, God.  They're a bore.  Hey.  Oh, you know.  You might want to go back to drinking.  I like that.  He just, like, so, yeah.  Yeah.  Pissing in parking lots.  Did you hear that one, Jimmy?  No. 
[03:05:00]  He's too bad that they're...  What?  I was too busy walking down the hall to try to get a final answer.  And, of course, the office was busy, so I didn't...  Oh, you're back.  Oh, my God.  Why would you put yourself through that?  We just know now.  I can't believe that it was ruined.  I just know now.  I can't believe this company ruined...  I knew from day one.  That's why I didn't really want to get involved.  I said it to Kenny that it had nothing to do with him and the people working around, you  know, the event.  I knew in the end it would be a waste of my time because, once again, we would be fucked. 
[03:05:30]  Every...  And our agent fucking stinks.  She doesn't even call.  Bob stinks.  He doesn't even call to tell us that, you know, what the answer is.  Why is he not in New York fucking handling this?  Why is he not stomping their guts out?  Literally.  He does nothing.  That's great.  So, it's ruined.  So, the event we had planned is destroyed.  They're an anchor.  Yes.  So, that means no events whatsoever.  I'm not going to do some lame, half-assed event when we had a real one. 
[03:06:00]  Finally had a real one.  Finally.  Yeah, that does away with any event.  I will never do an event with this company again.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous to even try.  I will do no events ever again.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  They want us gone.  It's obviously clear.  So, fuck them.  Let's just leave.  Yeah.  For real.  Let's just leave in October.  I'm kind of thinking that myself.  We haven't even met, like, any of the guys in charge.  And they've been on the job about a year.  I can't even get me there.  They're fucking...  They're not...  Well, they make the decisions in the end, so...  But if they're not interested in meeting with us, that really speaks volumes. 
[03:06:30]  We'll get everything arranged where we can have some space here in New York.  Set up a podcast thing.  And, you know...  Hey, good news.  O&A and Jimmy, Mark 3.  Hope you enjoy our new direction.  That's why we've got to keep pushing the podcast out there.  We've got to, like, build a podcast base.  Oh, yeah.  And then it'll be way more comfortable to do something like that.  Phones should be fixed. 
[03:07:00]  We updated firmware in operations.  Yeah, a week later.  On Wickland.  Checking in.  Bye, baby.  All right.  Great.  Real helpful.  Well, it falls within their seven-day plan.  Rob, you missed the Rob Ford clip where he doesn't understand why people are mad that he...  Pissed in a parking lot.  Pissed in a parking lot.  It's great.  We lost Jimmy.  He's not going to have it. 
[03:07:30]  He's very angry.  No, no, no.  I'm so fucking...  Thank God it happened just before...  Disgusted and so fucking just disheartened.  It's so fucking annoying.  But it makes me physically sick to my stomach.  It was a cool fan event.  We were all on board with doing it.  We all wanted to do it.  On board.  And they just have to get greedy and wreck everything.  And, you know, I don't bash Howard.  I don't give a fuck what he does.  But the bottom line is, hey, maybe his lawsuit was legit.  Fine.  But then you throw the guy a birthday party. 
[03:08:00]  It's literally like the wife who got punched in the face.  And then fucking comes back and fucks the...  It's just...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I want four actions.  I want to punch that fat fucking lady in the face.  What did she do?  That commercial.  With Dildash, I want four actions.  Imagine having to live with that shit.  Honey, look what I bought. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, God, that commercial annoys me.  All right, I got to go do a phoner.  Uh-oh.  Ten o'clock every day.  Finished.  That's it.  Fucking place.  This weekend, I'll be at the Garden State Comedy Club in New Jersey if you want to come.  And Friday, I have tickets going on sale for the Borgata.  Who cares?  Oh, Jimmy.  Honestly, I'm so fucking disgusted.  I know you.  I know.  Yeah.  And our fucking agent is fucking weak.  He's fucking weak. 
[03:09:00]  He's a fucking...  Worthless and weak.  He's weak, man.  Yeah.  He's fucking weak.  Let's call him.  Um.  Should we call him?  On air?  What is that going to do?  Oh, boy.  Crash the Bash.  Well...  We're not going to be invited to that.  We always find ourselves to... 
[03:09:30]  I wonder how much he has to pay for that.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, they're going to pay him.  I know.  I guarantee he's not showing up for Crash the Bash unless there's more money.  Oh, can we crash the Bash?  And this is all about them.  Yeah, we're really going to...  Because it's two weeks after his actual birthday, so this is an actual SiriusXM event, so that  means he's going to want more money because Howard is never...  Whatever.  I'd like to know.  It's all about them.  It ain't about him.  He's doing what he does.  It's them.  They are the ones trying to get money out of us.  What's he supposed to say?  Don't do that for me?  He's fucking smart. 
[03:10:00]  And his agent is weak.  Our agent's fucking weak.  I bet you that's an easy million for him to show up for the night.  Good for him.  A quick mill.  A quick mill.  Here's a mill.  Please show up for this event.  And then they extort...  Please say it's your birthday.  They extort us for money.  It makes me...  It's extortion.  It makes me sick.  Because our agent is not here fighting.  He's fucking doing nothing out in L.A.  He should be fired.  He literally should just be fired.  He stinks.  I could be our agent. 
[03:10:30]  What's that?  I'll be our agent.  Go in there.  Go get him.  Yeah?  I could give it a try.  A rule.  Is that the book lady?  Hell.  The book lady's walking down the hall.  It is the book lady.  Look at her.  She looks like a school marm.  She just smiled at us.  Don't smile at me.  Oh, God.  You're mad at her.  She's a very nice lady.  She saw two books sitting on the console.  She was happy.  She's like, ooh, books.  They're finally reading.  These are potential listeners.  I thought you were taking her gimmick.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  They better not be talking about books in there.  I'm talking about books.  We talked to two people today, guests, that have books.  Don't you read those books on the air?  I wonder if she'll be there.  So what type of paper did you use for your book?  She doesn't talk about the contents of the book, just the book.  The book.  So book covers.

I'm doing, uh, they're giving me a little demonstration. 
[03:13:00]  I thought we were going to do that on the air.  What happened with that?  The whole thing.  Yeah, I thought that was an on-air thing.  The Roland's thing is a separate thing from mine.  Oh.  So this one doesn't entail them giving me a free.  We have not gotten confirmation on that.  Oh, God.  I hear them.  Well, I will say.  You should cancel.  I was going to say, I hear that, uh, maybe I won't mention that.  There was news about, um, some other product.  Selling a lot?  What?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Also, bricking a lot.  What? 
[03:13:30]  Are they bricking?  I heard a lot of bricking.  Oh, hell.  They sold a million of them.  Hell yeah.  Oh, hell no.  All right.  Yeah, so I got to go down the hall into the conference room, is it?  We're all ready.  In the conference room?  Remember when, um, Connect came out?  Yeah.  And I had to go down the hall and jump like a retard?  That's right.  You didn't want to do it, and they made you do it.  They made me do it.  Aw.  You're terrible.  And I did.  I did.  I jumped.  You're a good company man.  And then I looked and said, well, that's pretty good.  And then I got it from my own home. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  I like that.  Connected.  Bowling.  It's fun.  Maybe we'll do that again today.  Okay.  About no jumping today.  Well, why?  I'm a little tired.  Yeah.  You think Jimmy's really mad?  Holy mother of Christ, is Jimmy pissed?  He's bluffing.  You think he's bluffing?  You think he's bluffing?  He's not really that mad?  But Kenny, you know Jimmy.  You think he's bluffing and not really that mad? 
[03:14:30]  Because I can't tell.  We should talk about it tomorrow.  Oh, shit.  Tomorrow?  What's going on tomorrow?  Yeah, what's that about?  Is there going to be some kind of a talking to tonight?  What's tomorrow?  No, you always leave them wanting more.  Oh, is that it?  We always leave them wanting something.  Right.  Or wanting more.  That implies they've gotten something.  That they want more of.  Well, they get ear aids every day. 
[03:15:00]  Ear aids?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Well, no.  Hold on.  Boom!  All right.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I hate to play the house liberal.  It's embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  I was going to say house something else.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  Jimmy.  Oh, that is such a hug of garbage.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  After O&A Live with Sam Roberts.  It's next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  It's After O&A Live.  David Blaine is here.  David Blaine's on his way in.  He's got a new special.  It's called Real or Magic.  And it airs tonight at 9.30 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time on ABC.  It's like his street magic.  Except he's doing it with all kinds of celebrities.  It actually looks really good.  He was out in the hall.  And he remembered me from asking him stupid questions when he was upside down. 
[03:16:30]  He was like, hey, man.  We met when I was upside down.  I was like, yeah.  Yeah, dude.  We're about to talk again.  Here he comes in here right now.  Now, David Blaine has just walked in.  You have a great memory.  It's not true.  You don't think you have a good memory?  I think it's affected from so many breath holds at this point.  Well, you came in.  I'm sure you don't remember my name.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Yeah, I remember.  Okay.  But you remembered me specifically when you were walking in the hall.  You said, yeah, I met you when I was upside down. 
[03:17:00]  So, now.  But it's not.  You're also not hard to remember.  That's for sure.  Do you think that?  Is it the hair?  Yeah, I think you definitely.  Or, you know, not.  You don't.  I would never forget you.  That's for sure.  That's good.  That makes me feel warm.  That makes me feel special, too.  You have this great.  I'm really excited about the special.  Because I feel like you're at your best when you're just doing the sleight of hand, close-up magic tricks. 
[03:17:30]  Thank you for saying that.  You know, tonight at 9.30 p.m.  Yeah.  On ABC.  It's called Real or Magic, right?  Yeah.  And you're doing your tricks that you've done on the street, but for celebrities.  And on the street.  So, for a big, for all different cross-sections.  So, I spent years shooting this.  So, it's, you know, anybody that, like, if I'd seen you, I would have gotten you for sure.  Oh, man.  Anybody that I found intriguing or I kind of targeted.  You find me intriguing?  Yeah.  I would have definitely hounded you on the street. 
[03:18:00]  Well, it's amazing because of the people that you got.  You got, like, Woody Allen.  He was incredible.  You got Kanye West.  He was awesome.  Did I hear you got George W. Bush?  I did, yeah.  That's amazing.  How do you get these people?  It was years of working.  And, you know, I would meet people when I was doing private gigs, whether it was President Bush or Kanye.  And I'd run this idea of doing something with them.  And I just kind of casually worked it out over the years. 
[03:18:30]  So, it's taken me.  This is probably, I'm not kidding when I say this, probably seven years in the making for this one show.  And I would imagine, though, that it's probably easier to get a celebrity to agree to be on this special than most other specials.  Well, no, because I think, because part of it was, you know, I wanted it to be natural and believable and real.  And I didn't want it to feel artificial.  So, I had to figure out a way to get to everybody, almost so they weren't prepared, really. 
[03:19:00]  So, you know, there was no crew.  It was me plus Matthew and a very small crew.  He did The Artist is Present, the Marina and Bromwich documentary.  And I knew that he has a very subtle way of shooting where he almost becomes invisible.  Oh, so this was not like, hey, we're shooting something.  Let me find you and we'll set up and we'll get the lighting.  Right. There was none of that.  There was, you know, everybody on the show, there was like no stooges, no setups, no, you know, nobody was paid to be on the show.  It was just literally just trying to pursue people in very natural environments and then try to do something shocking. 
[03:19:30]  So, where do you naturally find, like, George W. Bush?  Well, I was on a gig with him in China.  So, you have this idea in your head.  Right. So, I had a little camera and what I did is I nailed all the Secret Service guys in the morning because I knew they were going to get breakfast there and I did magic to all of them.  So, when it came time to do magic to President Bush, they were prepared for it.  So, it was very easy.  Oh, so you're not reaching into your pockets and they're like, down on the ground!  No, that's right. 
[03:20:00]  But it's even better than that because I made them so used to it.  It's like with him, you see me grabbing him and doing all the stuff that you should not do to a president and you'll see the result tonight.  That's good. That's good.  And you've kind of gotten clips out there.  Katy Perry is on the show.  Yeah.  Was there anybody that you were a fan of?  Yeah.  You were nervous to do this in front of?  Well, everybody on my show, every single person on my show, I was a really big fan of.  I actually really like and admire and respect every single person.  You do? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  But like I said, you know, I think everything, the whole point of, I think, doing magic is it has to be very natural and honest or else you won't get real reactions.  And the one thing I was sensitive to, which like I said, this is the years of pride, is how to get everybody to be comfortable enough that they can react.  Is it tougher to get that out of celebrities?  Because celebrities kind of spend their lives trying to be cool.  Well, it's not even trying to be cool.  It's that we're so used to being guarded because we're so worried about, you know, looking bad or idiotic. 
[03:21:00]  So that was a big part of figuring this out.  And it took me, like I said, years to figure it out.  But I figured out a way to kind of do things in a natural way and in people's natural environments.  And there was no lights.  There was no setup.  It was like we just walked in.  I didn't have any props.  I had like a deck of cards, an ice pick, a needle and some kerosene.  And that's kind of the making of an entire show.  That's a kerosene, yeah.  Are you, you invent all your tricks now, right?  I also have a team of great magicians that come up with these amazing ideas or I see things historically that I want to do. 
[03:21:30]  Like the guy that drinks the kerosene and then becomes a human dragon and blows it out.  And the only way to figure that one out is I had to travel to Africa to find the secrets from one man in the world or one or two that could do it.  So that's on the show.  You're not Wikipedia-ing.  Like, you know, looking up on Wikipedia, how do you blow fireballs?  Oh, they could do that.  No, no, because what was interesting to me about the guy that did it is he drinks the kerosene so it's in his stomach. 
[03:22:00]  And then he becomes like a human dragon.  So that, to me, that was like the cool, we've seen people do the fireballs and I've always thought that was cool looking.  But I was curious about how could this guy do it?  And then in research you find out that he died two years after he started and that's what killed him.  But, so that's been like a 20-year quest to try to figure out how to do that.  And so what's your strategy?  Just do it much less often than that guy did?  Well, that's-  So you don't die in two years?  That's basically the strategy, yes.  Yeah.  That is the strategy.  Because that's what you did on Jimmy Kimmel.  Right.  And what you're saying is exactly my strategy so far. 
[03:22:30]  But the other thing is I don't think he had charcoal pills to rinse out and things like that.  So I use charcoal to hopefully absorb as much of the kerosene and then get it out of the system as quickly as I can.  And you have to drink gallons of water before you do it?  Like a gallon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once you go further than a gallon, you're pretty much risking death.  You wouldn't want to do that before you drink kerosene, would you?  No, you need the water at the bottom of the stomach.  I mean risking death.  Oh.  What was- you kind of gained even more notoriety for the elaborate tricks and stunts like that. 
[03:23:00]  What was the most difficult?  Was it, you know, we met when you were upside down at Central Park?  That one was a nightmare.  That was everything that could go wrong went wrong.  That was part of the reason I had to pull away from everything and rethink everything.  Because it was so much layered in that I hadn't prepared for.  Did you know that you were going to have to take breaks?  Because I would imagine that it's kind of a pain in the ass to then have-  Here's what happened on that one. 
[03:23:30]  We didn't have very much time to put it together.  It was done quick.  But at this point, I was kind of cocky.  I was like, okay, I can do this.  Sure.  What did you just come from?  What was the trick before that?  Oh, yeah.  I had done the breath hold.  I had done the water tank.  So you're like feeling good.  Yeah, I felt like I can, I think I'd just done Oprah and I did the world record on this  thing and I was like, okay, I got this.  So my preparation for the upside down thing was literally I hung upside down on somebody's  weight rack with those gravity boots on and I did six hours and I was like, okay, I know 
[03:24:00]  I can do 64 hours.  We're all good.  That's it?  That was basically it.  But I had done like four hour stunts of it.  But then when I did six, but what I never accounted for was the catheter doesn't work when you're  upside down.  It's a nightmare.  So when you're upside down, forget all the blood.  Because you can hold it in for six hours.  Right.  Yes.  And I didn't press.  And anyway, that was the beginning of the worst thing. 
[03:24:30]  So that's what made me stop everything, rethink and try to figure out how to do something that  wouldn't be so embarrassing and ridiculous.  And then the end got messed up too.  Now, are you?  Oh, it was so awful.  Right.  Because everybody goes, what did we just see?  I thought this was supposed to be spectacular.  Yeah, it was crazy.  Are you the type of person who, you know, you see this vision of this trick that you want  to pull off and do you freak out when little things go wrong?  Are you detail oriented?  Oh, terrible.  And I'm so superstitious at the same time.  So it's like if everything isn't perfectly in place, I start to really get, I start to think 
[03:25:00]  everything is going to fail.  Oh, so psychologically you're off your game.  Once you have to start taking breaks.  And then I, yeah.  And then it's like, you know, I need to knock on wood left and right.  And this is going to be.  So yeah, it starts to really compound itself.  Yeah.  And then what about when you were in the box above the Thames River?  That was one of my favorite ones of all time.  Did you want when people start throwing shit at the box?  I got so lucky that they did that.  We had a plan that was like, I told all my friends that were around me before. 
[03:25:30]  I was like, how are we going to get people to actually pay attention to this?  It's so boring.  I'm just sitting in a box, not eating for.  And I said, you guys, it was 44 days.  So that's a long time to hold somebody's attention.  Right.  Sitting.  But I was like, you guys better be prepared to do something like, you know, shoot at the  thing or do something crazy.  And then sure enough, the media went nuts on it and they would send people every day  to do insane things, which definitely were huge distractions.  So it took time away from it for me.  And then all of those stories became like the worldwide news. 
[03:26:00]  The funny part about this stuff is like the majority of it was really boring.  There's just like people that were there supporting it.  So it's like the only interesting part was when something went wrong.  See, I figured that you'd be in your box going, I'm doing this to entertain you.  Why would you throw things at me?  But you, so you like when somebody like me comes along and asks goofy questions while  you're thinking upside down.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever you can do to start things up.  Anything to distract me is good.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you dumbfounded?  Because I was reading an article last night about criticisms of you and somebody, one of 
[03:26:30]  the criticisms was he said he would break the record for holding his breath or die trying.  And he didn't die.  Are you sitting there going like, are you mad that I'm alive right now?  No, well, to be honest, that's part of the intrigue, I think.  I think that's why people went to see Evel Knievel's, even though they were rooting for  him, they kind of wanted to see the crash.  Of course, yeah.  I think there's something about human nature that drives you towards wanting to be there  if something goes wrong.  Do you know when you're doing street magic, which audiences to go to? 
[03:27:00]  Do you know by now, for whatever reason, black people go fucking crazy for magic?  Well, I have to be honest, it's very specific.  It's like, you know, you go after lots of people and you might think that they're going  to have great reactions and their reactions might be internalized.  And sometimes that's just as good.  So it's not like you can't really generalize that much.  So you can't say, well, this group of people are, you know, Puerto Ricans or Asians or Jews. 
[03:27:30]  It doesn't work that way.  It doesn't.  No, and that's where I came up with the idea for street magic.  And I'll tell you how it happened.  I was 18 years old and I was hired by, or I was doing magic for Diane von Furstenberg's  house as a kid.  And her son, Alex von Furstenberg, I was doing magic to him and he started, his reactions  were amazing.  And even though I act like I'm not responding when people are reacting, I stay pretty stone  faced.  I'm like jumping inside.  That's like, you know, that's what you thrive off of.  Yeah.  You know, like when you do something to the audience.  So, and then I got in trouble for some, so I ended up spending the weekend in central 
[03:28:00]  booking.  And the first thing I did was grab the deck of cards off the floor from the big guys playing  spades.  And I started doing magic to them and they all started jumping around going nuts.  And I was like, wow, this reaction is the same as this.  And it's just like, one is jail.  The other is like a really amazing house that I have never been to anything.  And I was like, that's what the show is.  I want to show the, the, the, the, the common, the common thread between all different people  from all walks of life.  And that was the goal with street magic. 
[03:28:30]  Have you ever blown it in the middle of a trick?  Like to somebody, no, I just saw you put the card right in the right place at the deck.  Well, the cool thing about being a magician is nobody knows where you're going with it.  So even if they think they see something, if you can just play like they didn't, it doesn't  matter because they don't know.  So you have to be able to be like, okay, I messed that part up.  But I think that's why magicians get uncomfortable performing for magicians because magicians do know  where you messed up.  If like Penn Jillette will be there and be like, no, Dave, that's not how that trick  goes at all.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's there every day doing that. 
[03:29:00]  But there's never, every chance he gets.  There's never been a moment where the trick has gone wrong?  Um, I think that the big moment was one we discussed.  Yeah.  Except that big one.  Yeah, I think that was mine.  There's never been one of the small time ones where it's like you drop the deck of cards  or something and it's just, ah, you panic.  No, but I think you can make it look like it was part of the trick.  Yeah.  When did you figure out how to get, ah, girls doing magic?  Because I feel like you were the first, like, you know, sexy magician.  Well.  And that's, you know, as a heterosexual man, I feel confident in saying that. 
[03:29:30]  No, it's funny because as a kid, I wouldn't do magic to people my age.  I only did it to my mother's friends.  I kept it very secretive because as a kid or a teenager, you're doing magic.  You're a big geek and you get beat up.  It's a nerdy thing for kids to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're getting a lot of, you know, so I basically, other than a few close friends,  kept it very secretive and just worked on it and did things.  And then as I started to do it more and more when I got older and then started to use it  as a living, I started to get really, you know, it became really, really amazing to  see just all different reactions. 
[03:30:00]  And was it, do you think it was because of the street magic that people saw, okay, he's  doing this, but look at all these different people reacting.  This is not a nerdy thing.  I still think they think it's a nerdy thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah, of course.  What, so the special, I should plug the special again, 9.30 p.m. tonight on ABC.  When you're working hard on shows, on these either elaborate stunts or like you said, seven  years of working on putting together kind of this perfect show, what do you think of 
[03:30:30]  something like Criss Angel that does like, I mean, now he's just doing dumb stuff on TV.  Actually, I think anybody that works hard and puts whatever they got, you know, I'm never  opposed to anybody, and I think there's room for everybody, and I think, you know, anybody  that works hard, that's good enough for me.  So, now, do you like that there are other people who spread this word of magic, or are  you kind of, I concentrate on my own thing?  Well, no, I mean, I have a very close-knit group of magician friends that are mind-blowing, 
[03:31:00]  that are, that destroy, I'm, they destroy me.  Do we know them?  Well, no, all, most of the guys that are really good are so busy practicing that they're not  really out there, but there's, there are two guys doing a show called Nothing to Hide,  it's Derek DelGaudio and Helder, it's two friends of mine that are magicians, and the  show is in New York right now, and it's like an hour of amazing card magic, but it's mind-blowing,  so there's lots of good stuff like that out there, and there's lots of incredible magicians.  Who's your favorite reaction from the special tonight? 
[03:31:30]  Because, obviously, for you, it's about the reaction.  It's so hard to say, because there's so many different ones.  Obviously, the big, big deal for me was, you know, getting Stephen Hawking to react,  because they said, yeah, you can't, yeah, you can't do anything for him, he's not, he's  not feeling well, and he's not going to react to you, so even when he just cracked a  smile from a simple card thing, it was like, I wanted to, yeah, I almost wanted to cry  when that happened, I didn't, obviously, but it was pretty emotional.  And you think he's a genius, too, so he probably is, like, I know how to say that. 
[03:32:00]  So he's probably nicer.  He's probably my favorite.  Well, that's amazing.  Well, you can see all these, Kanye West, Stephen Hawking, George W. Bush, did you do Bush while  he was president, or after?  No, it was a few years after.  Okay.  Now, do you have another elaborate trick coming?  Um, the big thing that I've shied away from forever is building a tour, so the thing that  you saw in Jimmy Kimmel was one of the things that's part of the tour. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, so you are doing a tour?  Yeah, I want to go across the country and to really, like, you know, cool, small venues  and just start doing a live show, which is harder than anything in the world, I think.  Were you happy with Electrified?  I personally was, but, I mean, I think it, you know, I think it could be interpreted  different ways, but me, personally, I was happy that I didn't get lung cancer.  You know, something awful didn't happen from breathing 03 or...  Well, and that's, like, when people saw it, they're like, ah, he's not going to get electrocuted. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, it's so crazy.  And you're like, you don't understand.  I was getting shocked the whole time because my legs started expanding and it started ripping  through the chain mail, so the entire time I was getting shocked.  And then I, and then I, there was no catheter, so I had to hold it in the whole time, so  I stopped drinking water.  For three days?  It was the worst, by the way.  And then I spit, I had to get my mouth out, spit the water out, and an arc of electricity  hit the water, went inside, bruised my heart wall, burnt all the way down to my toes, and  I was, for three months, I couldn't do anything. 
[03:33:30]  Moving forward, I would say that's part of it, like, risk assessment.  How badly will this hurt me, and how badly does it look like it's hurting?  Because it should be more, it looks worse than it is.  I think I have it backwards.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I think it's for sure.  Well, David, thank you so much for hanging out.  I'm glad that we got to finally chat outside of, uh, outside of one of your tricks.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, very cool.  Are you going to watch the show tonight?  Absolutely.  I'm sure everybody's going to.  It's going to be a huge success.  Well, I don't know, but I mean, I worked really hard, and I think it's fun, and I think it's 
[03:34:00]  good.  All right, well, everybody check it out.  Thank you for being here, man.  Thank you, man.  The O&A Show continues.  Sort of.  This is after O&A Live.  Stay tuned.  Sirius XM.

This is After ONA Live.  Yeah, it is.  I can't imagine the frustration.  I hope you just heard David Blaine.  He was great.  He's got his special tonight at 9.30 p.m. Eastern over on ABC. 
[03:37:30]  He's doing his street magic, his sleight of hand and all that stuff for celebrities.  And all the video clips look great.  This is where even people who don't like David Blaine because of his over-the-top stunts,  nobody doesn't like his street magic where he's like freaking out black people and all that.  I think he was being dishonest, by the way.  When he said that you can't generalize people based on how they're going to react to magic,  I think we all know that black people are going to react to magic like crazy. 
[03:38:00]  And David Blaine's the one who proved that.  I didn't have that theory until I watched the David Blaine specials.  They think there's black magic afoot.  Some kind of voodoo shit.  But they freak out.  It's very entertaining television.  I don't know if black celebrities will react like that, but there's a bunch.  Jamie Foxx, Kanye West, and white celebrities too.  Harrison Ford, George W. Bush, Bobby De Niro.  Wow.  Can't wait to watch this special. 
[03:38:30]  But it bummed me out that the one stunt that Blaine has done is the electrified stunt.  That was the absolute, to me, I think, the most sort of he's not even doing anything stunt.  That was the reaction that I felt it got.  You'd watch it, and even when you watch the live stream, it looked like something you could do at the science museum.  It looked like when you put your hand on the ball and your hair stood up on all ends.  To find out in this interview that we just had that he was getting burned and hurt. 
[03:39:00]  If you're going to get hurt doing one of these things, it's got to be one of the ones that look painful.  It's just a bummer if the one tricks that look easy, like all you have to do is stand there and let electricity happen around you.  If that's the one where you get hurt, you've got something going on in your planet.  And I don't know what he was talking about either.  There's no way that he thinks that magic is still nerdy, because he fucks all kinds of hot chicks. 
[03:39:30]  Every time you turn around, you see him with another hot girl.  I think he used to hang out with Leonardo DiCaprio and guys like that.  But David Blaine's big special will be tonight over on ABC at 9.30 p.m.  Let's go to the phones, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Greg in New Jersey, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Yeah, I just want to say it's unfortunate that management torpedoed the boys' big event.  And that management was a real big anchor. 
[03:40:00]  And it's too bad everybody wasn't all on board.  Are you picking up on subtle hints that have been told throughout the show?  Not sure. I don't know. Speculating.  Well, regardless of the speculation, it ain't happening.  So you can guess all day as to what it was.  You're not going to see it.  Thanks, Greg.  Well, thanks.  Yeah, I do wonder...  I do wonder...  October's a long way away.  So today, Opie and Anthony and Jim were talking about how they had a big event planned 
[03:40:30]  based around the show and around Opie and Anthony's 20th year broadcasting together.  Now, this isn't going to happen because the company wants money from them.  A lot of money.  And they're talking seriously.  And I think it's the first time all three of them in unison have said,  yeah, maybe we have to leave.  When AROC, they always...  I mean, there's always some kind of hubbub when contracts come up with them about them leaving.  But has it ever been... 
[03:41:00]  First of all, I don't know if it's ever been this far in advance.  And second of all, I don't recall all three of them being as much on the same page as they were today.  No.  Usually, it gets closer to the actual time of our contracts expiring when they start getting like this.  But yeah, this is a year out.  What do you think?  This seems...  They're pretty eminent or whatever the word is about.  No, no, no.  What's the word?  I don't know.  They're pretty determined that this company is fucking them.  How far into that word, into trying to pronounce it, did you realize that you don't know how to pronounce it? 
[03:41:30]  The second before I said it, I was like, why am I saying this word?  You know what the word is.  You've heard other people use it.  I've said it before, too, and...  It's just gone from you today.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, maybe speech therapy is not the work that you'll go into if O&A don't exist after a year from now.  My mind got messed up from trying Xbox One.  Yeah, I was down there with the Xbox.  I want to go to it real quick.  I'll talk about that in a minute, because they are still taking meetings about video games. 
[03:42:00]  Drew in Louisiana.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, buddy?  I think you are a traitor for letting him slide, David Blaine slide on the Pendulet question.  Why?  What did I let him slide on?  Well, you let him slide on everything.  I mean, Pendulet thinks that guy's a hack.  Does he?  I mean, he said it on the show, what, four or five times?  A-Rock, does Pendulet think David Blaine is a hack?  No, I think it was Criss Angel.  Yeah, you're confusing him with Criss Angel. 
[03:42:30]  I don't think Pendulet's ever...  Hey, hey, hey, buddy.  Apologize to the audience.  And besides that, I'm not going to sit there and be like, whoa, you know what Pendulet said about you, don't you, Deb?  Pendulet.  Here's a clip.  Apologize to the audience.  No, because you apologize.  You just got David Blaine confused with Criss Angel.  No, you apologize.  You apologize.  Drew, you apologize.  You're the one who got the...  No, I am not.  You thought Criss Angel...  I'm not interviewing Criss Angel.  David Blaine is better than Criss Angel. 
[03:43:00]  I will let my contract expire in October and you apologize.  You apologize, Drew.  I'm sorry.  So am I, Drew.  So am I.  I'm glad we're better.  Thank you for calling in.  Thank you.  Let's cancel this contract and keep the leftovers.  Right.  Yes.  I was down there.  I ran down during the commercial break between the David Blaine interview and this to see what Ant was doing down there.  He was getting to try out the new Xbox.  It looks so fucking cool.  I'm bad at video games.  So I'm just horrendous at them, especially when they improve. 
[03:43:30]  I feel like they were so simple for a time and I could kind of handle them.  But every time there's graphic improvements, basically when they switched from directional pad to thumb joysticks, I was out.  I can't handle it.  I'm good if you can go up, down, left, right.  But when you can start going diagonal and you've got to kind of twist this way and you can turn around and there's three dimensions and you can see what's going on behind you. 
[03:44:00]  I'm out.  It's too much for me.  This new Xbox, though, so I'm not up on this stuff as much as I should be.  But this new Xbox, it's like a whole entertainment system.  It works with your TV and you get Skype on it and everything.  It hooks up to whatever the Xbox equivalent of iTunes is.  So it's got like 30 plus million songs that you can make your own playlist. 
[03:44:30]  Can you stream on it?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, it's like everything.  It's like everything.  And it was down there.  It's got every app that, you know, that you would think you would need in there for Netflix and other movie stuff.  And it's so funny because the only games that I play are WWE games and GTA.  I've tried other games, especially like when Rockstar comes in and they come in with, what was the spy game that they had?  Oh, not Max Payne. 
[03:45:00]  No, no.  I've tried Max Payne, but like the 1920s one.  Oh, L.A. Noire?  Yeah, I was about to say the film noir game.  L.A. Noire.  Like I'll try to play that a little bit, but there's too much going on.  And I'll try to play.  I can kind of handle racing games sometimes unless there's more than just racing going on.  But like that's where losing the directional pad screws me up.  Because the minute that you had to switch over to directional pad with your thumb, not directional pad, joystick with your thumb for racing games, I just started driving into walls and stuff. 
[03:45:30]  The tires got way too sensitive.  The turning and everything, I couldn't handle it anymore.  I longed for the days of having a Super Nintendo with a steering wheel.  I couldn't do it at all.  So, um, but I can, with GTA I can handle it because I'm not good at the game, but you don't have to be good at the game.  Eventually the cheat code comes out for all the weapons and you can just run around and shoot people and run away from the police. 
[03:46:00]  Especially if you ignore the storylines and just go off on your own.  Yeah, you do the storylines enough to unlock a bunch of the game.  But then once most of the game is unlocked, that's definitely the end.  Because that's when the stories start getting hard and that's when I can't do them.  That's what I did with GTA 4, when you got the helicopter.  Yeah.  Just would take the helicopter out, ignored all the stories and just kept crashing in the buildings.  Well, yeah, exactly.  And once you have the helicopter, you're like, okay, my mission, my goals are complete.  With GTA, uh, I unlocked all three characters and then the mission started getting a little harder and a little harder. 
[03:46:30]  I was like, okay, I'm still in this thing.  I got to a point where you had to steal a submarine from a ship and then guide it to some other.  I said, I'm done.  Tapped.  Tapped.  I'm out of here.  But I unlocked everything I needed to unlock.  I unlocked most of what they call California.  Uh, I got the plane.  So you can fly airplanes.  And I don't know if you know this.  But you can hijack airplanes, like little private airplanes in this GTA 5 game. 
[03:47:00]  You can hijack little private airplanes.  And you can, you know, fly into the sky with them.  And you know how when you're driving in that game, you can jump out of the car without actually stopping it?  Like if you just hit triangle or whatever the Xbox equivalent is, you can jump out of the car and it's still moving and you just roll down the street?  You know you can do that shit in planes too?  That's what I would do with the helicopter.  You just jump out of the helicopter?  You know, you turn it in a way where your guy would kind of fall out, but he's hanging on.  So the helicopter's sideways and you can see it's going into the building. 
[03:47:30]  And then you just drop the guy and he goes falling down to his death and then the helicopter plows right into the building.  I swear, actually Roland came over to my house.  And that's all we were doing was stealing planes, getting them to go up as high in the sky as humanly possible,  and then jumping out and watching them splat on the ground.  Because GTA figured it out where there is no sort of system of lives.  If you're not playing the game, you can just keep dying and coming back and dying and coming back.  You should try flying them into tankers.  See if you can hang out the harbor. 
[03:48:00]  I tried to land on the roof of the stadium, but then the plane just blew up.  So I felt like a terrorist.  I didn't want to do it anymore.  I feel like that guy in Buffalo, ride the railing and then just fall down.  Well, you'd have to get inside the stadium.  That seems much more elaborate.  Sure, there's a way.  Where there's a will, there's a way, Eric.  Right.  But, and then the wrestling games, I just play because I like wrestling.  But I thought, in my infinite wisdom, when Xbox first came out, because I had a PlayStation,  and then I had a PlayStation 2, and I think the first Xbox came out while PlayStation 2, 
[03:48:30]  like after PlayStation 2 was already available.  So I was sitting there looking at Xbox going,  Oh, you mean the next Dreamcast?  Let's watch this fan fade away.  Dreamcast.  That's exactly, I was like, look, you got your PlayStation.  PlayStation takes care of everything you need.  This, it's just another Dreamcast.  It's a fad.  You know, goodbye.  And then what happens?  Xbox basically takes over PlayStation.  I'm always wrong about that. 
[03:49:00]  If you, do you still watch South Park?  From time to time.  Last week's episode was a whole weird incorporation of Game of Thrones,  but splitting the people up as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One people.  Yeah, and I mean, now I feel like I'm going to get a PlayStation 4,  because I don't want to have an outdated video game system.  Does it matter?  No.  Of course it doesn't matter.  I'm never going to use it.  Who are you impressing?  Me. 
[03:49:30]  I feel like all.  By spending 400 bucks?  Yeah.  On this thing that apparently doesn't even play the old games.  The night it was released,  the stories are out there where they're selling millions of these things,  and by 3 a.m. at some of these stores,  people are already bringing them back because the systems were crashing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not getting that then.  Maybe I get an Xbox One.  I saw them playing with it,  and you hook it into your cable box,  and then you can watch TV,  and then switch to the game,  and then switch back to the TV,  and if I had a fantasy football team, 
[03:50:00]  you could track your fantasy football team there.  It was amazing.  I wonder if you can watch a movie while playing the game.  Oh, like that?  Like do the picture-in-picture.  How could you do that, though?  You've got to focus on the game.  You can multitask.  Well, you wouldn't...  Why would you need both going on at once?  Because sometimes playing a game is not enough.  What are you talking about?  You need more stimulation.  How much consumption do you need to take part in  that you would need a movie and a video game at the same time?  I think a lot of people would like that feature. 
[03:50:30]  You wouldn't be able to watch both at the same time.  Sure you could.  You would eventually learn how to balance the both.  It's all about balancing in this life.  Like if you're running through playing Call of Duty,  and then you're still watching a game or Raw or a TV show or something like that.  Have you ever thought about putting two televisions together?  I mean, I guess I could understand that...  I used to.  If you're watching a game, like if you're watching a football game,  then I could see also playing a video game, 
[03:51:00]  because you can watch a football game with half your attention.  Yeah.  But not a movie.  You just said a movie.  Yeah.  Well, you can't watch a movie like you watch a football game.  When I had my old apartment, I had two TVs next to each other.  Right?  Two little flat screens.  And I'd be playing the game on one and watching like Daily Show and Colbert Report on the other TV.  Do you think you were getting the sort of...  That's kind of a highbrow humor.  Do you think you were getting all the subtle nuances in those shows while you had whatever Pac-Man on?  I was playing Zelda Wind Waker. 
[03:51:30]  It wasn't even a cool game.  It was a cool game.  It's an awesome game.  Was it on your Wii?  No, it was on the...  What was that on?  GameCube.  You had your GameCube while you were watching Daily Show.  Yeah.  There's no way that you got anything out of either of those two things.  I beat the game.  It was a child's game.  It was GameCube, for God's sakes.  Awesome game.  GameCube was the next Dreamcast.  Paul in San Diego.  Paul. 
[03:52:00]  Hello?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Dude, there's nothing better than a GTA 4 getting three buddies, jumping into a plane, flying towards the city, fly towards the biggest building you can.  Everyone bail out at the same time.  Now, the plane doesn't hit the building, but all four of you and your buddies hit the building together.  Oh, like you fly in...  Your bodies smash against the building.  Yeah.  You and your three buddies.  That's awesome. 
[03:52:30]  All right, check it, buddy.  All right, thanks, man.  That's it.  Okay.  And you just splatter against the side of the building.  That sounds terrific.  Rob in Nevada.  Hey, I just wanted to let E-Rock know, yeah, you can play the game and watch TV at the same time as long as you have a TV that has picture and picture in it.  Oh, so you can do picture and picture.  But, Rob, you sound excited about this.  Is there anything besides, like, football or baseball that you can watch while you play a video game? 
[03:53:00]  No, I mean, the GTA, I guess, you can do.  But, I don't know, I'm not really much into Xbox too much except for playing football.  And I've actually really enjoyed playing baseball with it, too, as well.  But, that GTA, it's all right to play, but I get bored with it after a while.  I don't know.  I can't stop myself.  I will sit down.  I'll take long breaks from it.  Like, I won't play it for a couple weeks. 
[03:53:30]  But if you sit me down in front of that thing, I'll be there for hours.  Yeah, that's my problem, too.  The thing is, I'm a truck driver, though, so I don't really have much time to play it.  But when I do get home, I do like to play it every once in a while.  And you can't get me from in front of it.  All right, buddy, thanks.  He should do what the other truck drivers do, set up the gaming rig.  Laszlo was saying that.  A bunch of the truckers set up gaming rigs in the back of their trucks.  And so, whenever they stop, they can play.  Ryan in Ohio.  Hey, I was just calling about the Xbox One. 
[03:54:00]  I've had the Xbox ever since it first came out.  You didn't think it was going to go the way of the Dreamcast?  I did at first, but...  Oh, thank God.  I've had mine so modded.  You know, I've got LED lights on the inside and everything else like that, which is nice.  It's like a gay bar.  Yeah, kind of.  But that guy was wrong.  You don't have to have a TV with picture-in-picture.  You can be playing a football.  You can be playing Madden with your buddy. 
[03:54:30]  And all of a sudden, you guys can...  Like, it'll slide over a little bit, and a little box will appear where you guys can actually Skype back and forth.  Dude.  In the middle of your game.  Yeah, they were showing that in the office.  As much shit as the fast food and soda industry takes for making people obese, how does Microsoft get away with doing this?  Well, they say...  Everything on the internet, if you read about it and everything like that, technology is going to be the fall of the human race.  Yeah, I... 
[03:55:00]  It's kind of like WALL-E.  You know, the cartoon WALL-E.  Dude, you're not even going to have to stand up to turn off your Xbox.  It's just, oh, just leave Xbox on, and this is my world.  The one thing that I did hear about it is, if you get too many people in your room, like, say you get, like, eight people, you know,  and you've got, like, a bunch of people over watching the game and everything, and everybody's hooting and hollering.  Yeah.  It'll shut off.  Why?  Well, because there's too many voices and too much commotion going on in the room, and they can't keep track of everybody.  There's too much activity.  You need to sit silently and not moving. 
[03:55:30]  You can't be social.  You can't do anything physical.  You just have to give us your soul.  Right.  Pretty much.  All right.  Now, Eric...  Yeah.  ...is this something that excites you, the idea that Xbox is creating this thing where you will never have to leave your couch?  Well, I do that anyway.  See, to me, that sounds terrifying.  Like, what about the world to experience?  They're incorporating themselves into me.  So they're just figuring, like, we have a... we're trying to target the Eric Nagel type. 
[03:56:00]  Right.  He likes to sit on his couch, he likes to drink Coke floats, and he likes to have chicken tacos for dinner.  I don't have either one of those.  What can we do?  That's your menu.  What can we do?  And then they realize.  Make it so you never have to leave your couch.  What about your poor wife?  She has her own Xbox.  She doesn't want to play Xbox.  She wants to be intimate with you, physically.  No, she plays Xbox.  She's happy with the Xbox.  That's sad.  That's really sad.  Do you want to do this read first? 
[03:56:30]  Real quick.  Yeah, let me go to Max in Michigan, though.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's going on, Sam?  Chilling.  I'm Chetick.  Quick comment about the Xbox One and some of the features.  It will be running Microsoft, actually, on it, so you can run your Microsoft app if you  have, like, a tablet or you're running Windows 8.  It essentially runs a form of Windows 8.  Yeah, I saw it.  It does.  It looks just like Windows 8.  You can do that as well.  Like, you can talk to it, so you can just say, like, Xbox.  Yeah, thanks, Max. 
[03:57:00]  That was another creepy thing.  The guy was just in the office going, Xbox, hang up Skype.  And the Xbox would hang up the phone call.  You don't even have to do anything.  When you left, it follows you as you're moving.  If there's a bunch of people and you're the only one moving, when you left the room, it  followed you out the room while he was doing other stuff.  Like, you see the camera moving?  I don't know.  I think you might have to plug your GameCube back in.  And then when you walk in, it recognizes you, and then it'll say, hello, and then it  has your profile and loads everything up right for you. 
[03:57:30]  It recognizes by sight?  Yep.  That creeps me out.  That gives me the willies.  Look, don't, well, I don't know.  If you want to spend your money on Xbox, spend your money on Xbox.  But you know if you do that, you're going to have to get the girl in your life something  nice.  Eric thinks that his wife wants to play Xbox.  She doesn't want anything to do with Xbox, okay?  She just wants something sparkly and something shiny.  The holidays are coming.  No, not Xbox.  And I don't care how many LED lights you put on it.  It's not enough.

Oh, you gave me the wrong time.  Yeah, I forgot.  We weren't doubling at the end of this.  I need you on the ball.  Sorry, man.  You know I need you on the ball here.  I was thinking of Xbox.  Well, I was going to say thank you to David Blaine for doing the after show.  The video of that interview, assuming that it turned out okay, will be up online later 
[03:59:30]  today.  Hopefully, they'll post it on the blog.  Blog.SiriusXM.com or SiriusXM.com slash blog.  You can also get the O&A clip of the day every day over there at SiriusXM.com.  Did he shake your hand?  Slash blog.  Yeah, oh yeah, that's what I wanted to post.  He showed me, when we were talking, he's got a scar on his hand.  And he was showing it to me.  He shook my hand.  And then he was like, hey dude, you know, I know you're going to watch the special, but  look at this. 
[04:00:00]  And there was a legit, not a magic scar, but a scar scar that was on his hand.  And I go, okay.  He said he had to jab an ice pick into his hand.  Because, I don't know, I guess the implication was the trick wasn't working like it was supposed  to, so he just had to do it for real.  And he said he had to tell the censors at ABC that it was just a trick, but he had to  really do it.  And he showed, there's a scar on his hand that was the size of an ice pick being jabbed into  it.  That's ridiculous.  It was crazy. 
[04:00:30]  Is that why you were asking?  Well, that, and I just thought he was one of those types that doesn't like to be touched.  Oh no.  Did you hear the chemistry we had together?  Another, he loves to be touched.  Are you now his exclusive go-to guy for interviews?  I think so.  That's the third time we've spoken, and he really likes me.  I like him.  We get along great.  Nick in Tennessee.  Hey, what's up, Cam?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  Show's too close to an end for a hundred like this.  Do it all!  Eric, is that great or is that great?  No, that's fucking horrible.  What do you mean?
